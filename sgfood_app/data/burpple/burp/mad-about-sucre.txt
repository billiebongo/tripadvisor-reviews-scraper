It feels like a fresh beginning and spur of vigour for Mad About Sucre - their new cake selection (which includes the pistachio-heavy Viburum and the tropical Anemone) are more overtly aggressive in flavour profile, eschewing reliance on nuance for a bolder and more assertive approach, while elsewhere the aesthetic-minded, Instagram-era diner would find lots to fawn over with the confidently distinctive visuals at play this round.
Linguine, Winter Mushroom 🍄 in Aglio Olio Sauce (S$25+)\n<br />Available in the Pop Shop Menu in @MadAboutSucre  till this Sunday.\n<br />The handmade pasta 🍝 was tender and smooth.

Inspired by the Parisian church of the same name, this heavenly dessert is light and delicate.
Could only use this photo as my cutting attempt failed 😝 The Église Saint-Augustin de Paris: the ruby red dome is all the red berries you can think of: cranberries, raspberries &amp; strawberries. Lightly flavored cream cheese with a sponge base, perfectly paired with Rose tea. Service impeccable as always 😘Hopeful to visit again before the year ends 😊
Hehehe happy mid week ya all ! Oh if you have yet tried desserts from @madaboutsucre ,then perhaps it\'s time u make a trip there !
Beauty and the beast in a tart. Don\'t be fooled by beauty of the layers of intricate handcrafted chocolate work. Hiding inside is a beast, chocolate so potent it\'s sure to make your nose bleed. \n<br />Monsters are hiding everywhere. Rawr!\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #madaboutsucre
The nutty and indulgently rich dome was a Tang Wei and Tony Leung-esque filthy romp between roasty, thick and creamy almond nougat and milky, unflinchingly drunken homemade French whisky (ie Baileys). Elsewhere, the sour apricot insert lurked surreptitiously in the background and the crumbly base played it like a delectable salty peanut biscuit. 4.2/5
French Whisky, Cream, Honey, Almond Spiced Sable, Almond Crispy Crepes, Apricot and Mascarpone. Probably one of Mad About Sucre\'s most intricate cakes available, for its made up of more components than usual for their collection of cakes. Part of their Winter collection released today — it\'s incredible how they made this entirely from scratch; the French Whiskey brewed by themselves just for the cake. Featuring a yogurt mousse, the creation of the mousse is similar to that of a nougat — pulled and with almonds added into it; just with a slightly different end product as a mousse. The nougat flavours come across as subtle here, but the apricot gel gives it a lingering fruitiness. Glazed with honey and their own French Whiskey, there is a slight torched feel with a boozy flavour without being too alcoholic — you could taste that Whiskey itself but not that sharp flavour acquainted to alcohol in general. What I absolutely loved is the spiced sable it sits atop on — a very good contrast of saltish nuttiness that complements the elegant and luxurious cake very well. If you are one who likes nutty and alcoholic desserts without too much of a fruity touch, this is one that you should try!
⠀\n<br />P.S. The Pettite France off the new menu is quite possibly the most outlandishly brilliant cake from Mad About Sucre yet. I\'m still reeling from all the Baileys-esque titillation.
It is one of the new dishes debuting on their Autumn/Winter savoury menu, joining a lineup which includes their Classic Slow-Cooked Oxtail with Burgundy Red Wine Sauce and their Baked Slab of Pork Ribs in Moroccan Fire-Pit Sauce.\n<br />⠀\n<br />I was the first customer who passed through the doors of Mad About Sucre some eighteen months ago, when they first launched with a five-cake selection and no savoury food. Like observing your friend\'s Sheltie grow from a young puppy to a regal, furcoat-wearing beast, I have watched Mad About Sucre grow from strength to strength since their opening, and the greatest surprise has been the introduction of their savoury offerings, which often possess a ferocity of provincial flavours so primally comforting yet startlingly sophisticated in flavour profile that any initial eyebrow arching in response to dish prices is eventually assuaged. I hope this Sheltie leads a blessed and long life - it deserves to.
But then again if you\'re crazy about desserts with a back story go for it.
Dark Mexican Chocolate, Dark French Chocolate, Almond Cream, Coco Bean Tuile, Chocolate Meringue. A rich dessert to have after a light meal, perfect for chocolate lovers.\n<br />#MadAboutSucre #ChocolateNoir
You know how salmon has a distinctive taste (which accounts for the salmon-haters saying there\'s a \"fishiness\" about it)? Well, it did not exist here.\n<br />Besides the fact that this sashimi-grade wild salmon was personally sourced in Norway by the owners of Mad About Sucre, the care they took in preparing it was apparent, as revealed in the very moist, vivid orange flesh. Quite unlike nearly every salmon I\'ve had elsewhere to be honest.\n<br />What astonished me most was the layer of soft paste-like sauce that was spread across it. Made with saffron, Spanish garlic, paprika and light herbs, it was complex in aroma and flavour, yet it never overpowered the delicate fish.
So this is what childhood summers spent in Central Pyrenees, south-western France taste like. Crafted from lychees, red currants and oats, the \"Cirque de Gavarnie\" is a dessert I would more than gladly have multiples of. I found it refreshing with a well-balanced fruitiness coupled with a playful punch of sourness from the red currant flavoured jelly-like ball. What\'s also interesting is its pristine graphic form is inspired by an outstanding natural feature of that region - a glacier. Honestly, I don\'t think I can do justice to the full inspiration behind it here. It is best that you pay Mad About Sucre a visit to treat yourself to this, and listen to the story unfold from the restaurant owners themselves.
A creation of contrasting textures featuring a crisp chocolate sable base and meringue with light-as-air almond cream and cocoa bean tuile. We are talking premium quality chocolate here because Mad About Sucre uses both Mexican Dark Chocolate (66%) and French Dark Chocolate (100%) to compose this exquisite dessert.
Stewed in French Pinot Noir for four hours, the chunks of grass-fed Angus ribeye were superbly tender and flavourful. Slathered with an even layer of garlic butter and perfectly toasted, the accompanying crusty baguette was no afterthought either. This big portion of robustness would suit those with healthy appetites very well. 
Made without any sugar! Intense chocolate flavour, the outside is like a brownie, the inside is molten chocolate!
Inspired by the Montmarte hill in Paris, where sunlight glints off the rooftops below.
It\'s only my second visit here, and I\'m surprised Eric remembers me. Such personable service!\n<br />🔸\n<br />Look at those shiny things on the cake! The ladies said they\'re diamonds, while I think they\'re perspiration 😂, because Eric said this is inspired by a summer walk in Montmarte. But these are actually sugar crystals, which has a hint of gula melaka taste to it, probably due to the cake\'s top layer of coconut mousse with grated coconut. The base is made from Turkish lemon in a thin sablée shell. You may opt for tea pairing, and you would be served Chamomile Blue Ginger Tea with this cake.\n<br />🔸\n<br />So are those shiny sugar crystals perspiration or diamonds? :)\n<br />🔸\n<br />#dessert #dessertporn #cake
Smooth velvety filling in the inside and a nutty crunch consistency on the outside was a good play on the palate as you will experience a myriad of flavours.\n<br />.\n<br />Mad About Sucre\n<br />Address: 27, Teo Hong Road, Singapore 088334
Very impressed by the desserts here, where they aren\'t just about being sweet and pretty. Yes, they are still pretty, but that\'s secondary because it\'s the thought and technique used by the pâtissier to create the desserts that really impressed me.\n<br />.\n<br />Multiple surprises here. The base is soft, but not liquid like chocolate lava. Cut through, it holds its wobbly form, but within the mouth, it melts. It\'s blended with Mexican 66% dark chocolate and 100% dark French chocolate, without sugar added. Aren\'t that going to be bitter? But no, French chocolate are rich but aren\'t bitter, explained Eric who\'s one of the partners. Even though no sugar is added to the chocolate base, sweettooths will get their relief from the almond cream, coco bean tuile and chocolate sablée and meringue. Even the sides were hand made to achieve a thinner crust, and the whole cake is made using natural ingredients.\n<br />.\n<br />You may also opt to do a tea pairing with your desserts. In our case we had two different teas for our two desserts and we paid $8.60 net per pax for the tea. For this Chocolate Noir, it was was paired with Moroccan Mint Tea Blend.
The peppery, garlicky and well-oiled linguine was zhup-ly wet with anticipation while elsewhere the delicate, gossamer-skinned cubes of foie gras deflate marvellously in your mouth, revealing their indulgently, lusciously gooey softness within. 4.1/5
Smooth velvety filling in the inside and a nutty crunch consistency on the outside was a good play on the palate as you will experience a myriad of flavours.
Cirque de Garvanie ($12.80), which has a redcurrant globe resting majestically atop a beautiful lychee cake and wild oats base. It is recommended to get a bit of each component and savour everything in a single bite to experience a myriad of flavours starting from the initial sweetness before ending off with a tangy sensation at the back of your tongue.
The slightly grainy pecan orb was nuttily assertive with a Bailey-esque creaminess, and sat its voluptuously buxomly self on a rich, indulgent chocolate rice-y cushion. At its core was a sweet and sour mandarin orange heart along with rum cream that smelled like it may have spent too much time jiggling its pony last night at Sugarhall. 4.2/5
Or in English, \"The Pebble\". Part of the new Summer \'16 collection of Mad About Sucre\'s menu which is inspired by their childhood summertime memories spent at the lake skipping pebbles across the water.  A daring attempt of using Pecan Nuts as an ingredient for the cake, the orb is a pecan mousse encasing mandarin orange gelee and rum mousse within. Stick the fork vertically down to enjoy the various levels of flavours here; that subtly nutty flavour of the pecan mousse accompanied by a bright and zesty citrus flavour contributed by the mandarin oranges — all well complimented with the dreamy rum flavours that run within. The Mandarin Orange Tuile is made from a labor-intensive process of juicing out mandarin oranges and dehydrating the skins etc; tasting a little smoky from flame-torching and still achieving that bright, citrusy flavour typical of Mandarin Oranges and having a texture akin to crystalised sugar than being biscuity. What blew me away was the Pecan Nut base which was roasty, nutty that went surprisingly well with the mousse cake itself; certainly gave it a textural and flavour contrast that was totally on point.
This is da bomb with its natural full-oceanic inspired flavors yet light-tasting gooey cheese. The whole dish is very well balanced and is on the palate and big on tastes, this dish is a winner for me. Heard that they are going to change the menu soon, so hurry down and chomp it down before it\'s over!
Smooth, rich yet light on the palate, balanced flavor with real taste of dark chocolates, great varying textures.... The flavors are pure intoxicating..... Rumor\'s that the current season is the last season for San Domingue..... I will enjoy while it last for the next 3 weeks!
Caramelized normandy &amp; Granny Smiths Apple, topped w almond cream and Tahiti vanilla cream in short pastry. In need of time like this.
After an extremely satisfying and filling meal at Andre, we actually made it to MAD about Sucre for more desserts. \n<br />Some new items, and hey, they are celebrating their 1st birthday. \n<br />Time flies!
A lovely combination of matcha and cream cheese, I find the fillings was too little for me to enjoy it. But i think it might have been too much of a good thing due to the previous dessert 😅 so i dont really taste it :(
.\n<br />A two-tier choux dessert made up of petite profiteroles; top layer with matcha fillings and bottom layer with mascarpone vanilla cream fillings held together by glazed french caramel.\n<br />.\n<br />Special thanks to @spadely &amp; @travlim for the sweet surprise birthday treat.
#onthetable is {Saveurs De Printemps} - Spring selection. This amazing piece of a cake is actually French earl grey, apricot, grapefruit and blood orange, smooth to the palate, not too sweet and a slight tang from the citrus. Omg, easily my favourite cake of the night! 😍 Can\'t wait to go back to try the other cakes already... this time, I\'ll go on an empty stomach😂 Thanks for your recommendation @nahmj, I\'m #madaboutsucre
The unexpected and unusual pairing of the heavy-palate ingredients, particularly the egg, winter foie gras, grilled fresh prawns and caviar, works well together and delivers a flavor that is complex yet fresh and gratifying. The tangy emulsion sauce binds the entire dish together. Mad About Sucre does it best again with the art of flavors balancing. A very well thought and well conceptualized dish, a salad fit for the King indeed.
San DomIngue ($12.80)....I\'m going Mad just thinking about it 😝. 70% single origin dark chocolate. Once you cut open the sphere, you will find caramelised plantains coupled with banana cream, chocolate mousse and a last layer of chocolate ganache. Topping it all off, a chocolate box with rum. You\'re suppose to cut open the box and cake, dip each piece of the cake onto the rum. This will coat your tastebuds to create chemical reaction that will cause the chocolate flavour to develop. Sitting on brittany biscuit, which is like a shortcrust biscuit to accompany the main dish. Truly grateful for this delightful dining experience. ☺️🍫🍌
The skin of the duck leg was well done, though not as crispy as I wish. The flesh is very fork-tender and it falls off the bone easily yet maintains a regal textural presence. The sauce of Bigarade (bitter orange) &amp; Grand mariner sauce was a distillation of all the essence of good-old natural ingredients made from scratch. One of the best duck confit, I would say. Another winner indeed!
The flavor of the matcha is complemented by the double French caramel that was used to stack the spot-on textured profiteroles. The base of the profiteroles are filled with vanilla mascarpone cream. Technically very accomplished, it was a dessert well done!
PIece Montée ($13.80), there are 2 different layers. For the top layer, each piece of this chox pastry is filled with matcha cream, whereas the bottom layer, mascarpone vanilla cream. Each coated with double boiled caramel, to eat them, we just pick them out using our hands and dap it onto the raspberry coulis. I love how they educate each customer about their dessert. 👏☺️
I love how meticulous they are in serving their customers. Immediately upon arrival, their staffs will greet you and start explaining their different dessert on their menu. Upon serving they will give you a short introduction about that dessert. They also do a tea pairing for each dish, do go for it! First, we had their La Normande ($12.80) which is an apple tart made up of caramelised normandy, granny smith, almond cream, chantilly cream and Tahiti vanilla ice-cream. A great dish to start with to open up your palate for the upcoming sweet treats. 😋🍏
Good sauces are the hallmark of a good French dish. This sauce, subtle and well balanced with all the complexities of flavors, is a very well-made sauce. The sauce, as confirmed by the team at Mad About Sucre, is made from scratch and hence explained its smooth texture, rich flavors yet light. The young poultry leg stuffed with organic wild rice and flavored by foie gras, needless to say, is well done. A well-executed dish which is usually served in fine-dining restaurants.
architecture level is strong with this ☝ am I right? hehe! \n<br />a trail of raspberry coulis on the side for pluck and slide dessert 🎮 play! sweet and sour pairing to balance the dessert, picking the dessert was recommended and it wasn\'t so sticky that you need a lot of strong to pull them off... can\'t imagine piercing them and they break apart &gt;
For something richer in taste, this 70% single origin chocolate is for you. It consists of a caramelized plantain, brittany crunch and a jewel box of rum. 🍫
The clever use of yet-to-be-in-full-season Spring fruits of strawberries, lemon, raspberries and the famed Laurent Perrier Brut Champagne create a flavorful cake balanced by the underlying tartness of the citrus fruits. Just like an early Spring morning after a frosty night, this cake is a perfect as a palate starter and kept me yearning for the next cake on the Spring line up. Another well-conceived and great executed creation again!
This arrived beautifully with hot smoke rising from it. A simple and slightly spicy pasta. Nothing fancy. Nothing to complain about either. Wouldn\'t have mind if garlics are added though \'cos I\'m used to having garlic in my Aglio Olio.
Though there is a slight tart after taste due to the usage of grapefruit, blood orange and apricot in the cake in parts, the subtle &amp; graceful flavor of French roses and the earl grey tea lift the cake to a long finish with waves of flavors rolling in. The textures, the taste, finish and the flavors of Saveurs De Printemps transported me to another idyllic world where everything else can wait. Indeed another triumph for Mad About Sucre!
The posh champagne jelly was inappropriately inebriated to such a degree that it probably contravened something in the Liquor Control Act, whilst elsewhere the glacial and understated strawberry cream struck a dainty pose atop its taciturn lemon curd cheesecake-esque mattress and the raspberry sent scarlet shocks of sour down the spine. 3.9/5
A perennial favorite - the owner highlighted that no sugar was added in this dessert except a pinch in cooking the banana. The mousse went beautifully with the rum and shortbread. It was recommended that we eat the rum-filled chocolate on top first to coat our palate with rum, so that the chocolate flavor would emerge more intensely. 
The earl grey did not emerge distinctly, but was rather overpowered by the apricot centre. Would have preferred a little more texture to the cake too - the tuile helped, admittedly, provide some crunch to the otherwise mousse-like texture of the entire cake. 
One by one , piece by piece , pop it in your mouth. \n<br />Filled with mascarpone vanilla on the bottom , matcha cream in the rest of the choux , don\'t wanna get your hands all sticky ? Then get your bae to feed these little balls of joy to you 😍😜🙌🏼 Mad About Surce has launched its Spring Collection ..if you haven\'t been here before then what are you waiting for ?
Piece Montee S$13.80 - a stack of mini choux pastry stuffed with Japanese matcha cream and mascarpone vanilla cream, sitting on a almond sable. It is then glazed with French caramel, the sweetness of the caramel makes it balance from the bitterness of the matcha. Really enjoy this. Also, it is recommended to eat it w your hand, one by one.👌🏼
The masterpiece consist of choux pastry filled with Japanese matcha cream on top and mascarpone vanilla cream at the bottom. Stacked with almond sable and glazed with French caramel. Savour it one by one :)
The flavor of the matcha is complemented by the double French caramel that was used to stack the spot-on textured profiteroles. The base of the profiteroles are filled with vanilla mascarpone cream. Technically very accomplished, it was a dessert well done! Thanks to Mad About Sucre for introducing us to the real Parisian cakes!
The presence of the classily demure and full-bodied earl grey is only detected after it has successfully materialised and condensed onto your tongue, and elsewhere the citrusy elements within send a glacial lightning shock through the creamy gentleness. 4.1/5
Part of Mad About Sucre\'s new Spring collection. Essentially a croquembouche with choquettes filled with matcha (for the top layer) or mascarpone cheese and vanilla (for the bottom) layer separated with almond sable, stacked freehand without any use of other equipment. True to the classic French style of Choux pastry, the puffs are a little more firm and cookie-like, despite being still soft. Filled with matcha cream, the puffs on the top layer were tastefully bitter and aromatic, without being overly sweet even with the French caramel that was used to bind all the Choux together. I liked how they placed the lighter flavoured Mascarpone cream and Vanilla puffs below for a lighter finish. Not sure about how others would think, but I certainly find the portion just right for a cream puff junkie like me; don\'t judge!
Confit of Duck, Sauce of Bigarade &amp; Grand Marnier, French Gratin Potatoes and Citrus Fruit Concasse. One of the many dishes from Mad About Sucre\'s newly introduced lunch menu which features full-sized savoury food. First time trying their savoury food and must say that I am quite impressed with how it went; the duck being so crisp on the exterior yet maintaining tenderness in the streaky meat without resulting in a mush, and not even hitting anywhere near salty. The accompanying sauce is a combination of brown sauce and red wine, spiked with a little Grand Marnier with pulpy orange bits; lightly savoury yet feeling really premium yet carrying the fruity acidity that is required to cut into the duck\'s savoury flavours. Gratin potatoes were delightfully soft, creamy yet adequately cheesy. Even the accompanying salad matches it well; lightly dressed to not steal the duck\'s limelight with a little peppery flavour to switch things up to taste buds a bit.
The herb rub on the back of the sea-fresh King prawn brought forth the natural flavors and put this dish as \'THE\' pasta dish in Singapore. To be fair, the Aglio olio linguine with the subtlety of the garlic, the chili and the fine olive oil delivers big time too. A very well-composed dish exuding the simplicity yet complex flavors and techniques of the chef behind this dish. From cakes to desserts and drinks, savories to festive set menus, the team at Mad About Sucre surely knows how to punch their way into the epicurean scene.
Aptly named, this 6-chocolate dessert platter is indeed an extended chocolate composition consisting of 16 varieties of chocolates around the world, blended and handcrafted by the chocolate masters at Mad About Sucre. My favorites based on rankings:

A Chocolate lovers symphony, packed with nothing but wonderful variations of chocolate. \n<br />Teasing, caressing, titillating and violating our senses. \n<br />Monster\'s favorite would surely be the White chocolate mousse with Espresso gelee. A simple mousse with such depth. \n<br />As each element is added upon another, the flavors evolve, the tones change, as it dances hip hop across your tongue. \n<br />Monster gives 2 paws up for chocolate and then another and another. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #madaboutsucre
Because who doesn\'t use linguine for everything. It\'s like a universal noodle that can be used for nearly anything. \n<br />Once again the sauce is key. Sweet, zesty, flavorful umami goodness with the local spicy kick. Feels almost like home. \n<br />Monster should start cooking at home again. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #madaboutsucre
So my favorite dessert place has a pop up store concept for this few weeks. So of course I\'d be there on the first day to try it. \n<br />Walked in to see lots of multicolored paper planes hanging on the ceiling and walls and a stack of handwritten menu. Talk about handmade. Loved the kid inspired feels. \n<br />Coming back to the food. \n<br />Simplicity makes for unfailing comfort food. The star of this dish is the cream sauce, tangy and garlicky. \n<br />Monster loves garlic. Perhaps he could scare some vampires away with his garlic breath. :p\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #madaboutsucre
The herby linguine had a playful bounce to its bite and the Spanish fermented garlic offered an unusual and unexpected crunch to the proceedings, whilst the nicely charred and gargantuan king prawn deserved its regal namesake, having the natural sweetness of fifty young maidens and the supple plumpness of an NSF Eagle coy swimmer who is trying to bulk up. 4.2/5 \n<br />This item is from the Pop Shop menu which lasts from 12 -31 January 2016.
From the Cold Terrine of Ocean\'s Catch to their Crepe Suzette, the taste buds have been caressed, feather-tickled and French-kissed tonight. \n<br />This place has truly come a long way since my very first visit here in February, and I\'m dead excited to see what other tricks these guys have up their sleeves on both the sweet and savoury front. Totally deserved being No. 3 on this year\'s Burpple Hot 100, and one of my personal recommendations for places to try in 2016.
Every single bite was packed with bits of apricot, cranberry, currant, orange peel, and nuts (pecan?), so much so it felt like 65% fruit, 35% cake. There was no acidic or astringent taste left from the 30 year-old brandy added in, only the woody and sweet essence further enhanced by the accompanying rum cream and rum sauce decorating the plate. The patissiers must\'ve known a single slice would not have sufficed. If you get high on this cake, it won\'t be from the alcohol, but the overall decadence of the dish. It was a recommendation from one of the owners to pair this with Melange Fourteen, a light floral rose tea.
From introducing the menu to pouring the tea, the whole ambience here makes you feel really welcomed and relaxed. \n<br />We are having the Creme brûlée ($17.80). There are two ways of eating it. Firstly, to have it either with or without the mint leaves. Secondly, to try it with the various fruits individually as they react differently with the Creme brûlée.

Trying out their Rue Montorguiel which combines Cocktail of Fruit Liqueur Limbibed Baba, French Liquored Cherry and most importantly Roasted Pistachio! #madaboutsucre #ruemontorguiel #burpplesg #burpple
Coincidentally, my first visit to the place too! \n<br />Christmas Cake ($11.80) - technically a Christmas Panettone fruit cake (with apricot, cranberries, currant and orange peels) baked in aged brandy that went well with the vanilla light rum sauce and rum chantilly cream! \n<br />With the cake baked with aged brandy, the alcohol part might have evaporated but the light brandy fragrant lingers on. Chopped nuts scattered around were crunchy and smoky, adding on flavours to the whole dish!
Essentially the gustatory equivalent of seeing your familiar friend of many years in (ahem) naughty and slightly inappropriate Santa attire for the first time. The alcoholic fumes diffuse efficiently in your mouth upon first bite, with the fruity crunch and roasty nuts making you feel all festive and want to curl up like a kitten by the fireplace. 4.1/5
Pretty innocently named with an equally innocent presentation, the Christmas Cake here comes spiked for it is made using Aged Brandy, Apricots, Cranberries, Currant, Citrus Peels, Vanilla Light Rum Sauce and Rum Chantilly Cream. It\'s pretty potent for how evident the aged Brandy is throughout the moist cake, getting only stronger with each bite, while the fruits were able to exude their natural sweetness into the cake; the only form of sugar that supplies the cake\'s sweetness (they claimed that no sugar was used for the cake). Vanilla Light Rum Sauce adds yet another form of alcoholic flavour into the dessert, while the Rum Chantilly Cream is a little more subtle in flavour, helping to even out the flavours for a more balanced taste. A dreamy and elegant dessert to celebrate Christmas.
Sometimes change is for the better, and sometimes its not. But no matter why things are changing, we need to be able to let go and move on.

This is the crowning glory of the savory menu at Mad About Sucre. Like their forte in balancing the textures and flavors for their cakes, this dish further exemplified their amazing play of textures and flavors. The charred crispiness of the foie gras hiding the creaminess texture and the buttery flavors within, coupled with the citrus apricot compote and crunch of the greens. Certainly one of the best foie gras I have came across. This is a triumph, loud and clear.
A gathering place of sorts, to socialize while going about your daily shopping chores. \n<br />This baked item brings forth the feels of home. If I had a European family, I think this is what grandma would make. \n<br />The roasted pistachio cream and the strawberry compote make almost a PB &amp; J open faced sandwich on the liquor baba cake. \n<br />There\'s something very comforting about PB &amp; J. \n<br />Childhood feels. \n<br />Monster is youthful once more. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
The first step up the mountain of subtle young chestnuts and rum. \n<br />The flavors grow in complexity and strength slowly reaching the pinnacle of rich roasted chestnuts, French caramel and chocolate in an explosion of elevated joy and colors. \n<br />It\'s beginning to look a lot like Xmas and Monster just can\'t wait!\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
A very different and unique experience compared to other dessert places , the friendly staff explains the story behind each dessert and pick the right pot of tea to make it perfect! ☝️😍. 🏆 #madaboutsucre
The first spoonful was coated with the beautiful Autumn\'s bounty of chestnut and rum. The oral euphoria journeys into increasing complexity yet in a mysteriously way, very gratifying and comforting. The final spoonful of chestnut, rum, chocolate and caramel ignited series of oral enlightening. Pure heavenly, pure bliss, pure satisfaction and pure quiet tranquility!
This dessert is from the autumn/15. And what inspired them to create this dessert was presented to me like a story and how I interpret this entire dessert was mind-blowing! This dessert is pretty much like a cheesecake but it\'s so light in flavors that you don\'t really taste the cheese. Which reminded of this scenario that the service staff told me. Just like in autumn, you have those very small flowers on the field. In the transiting of the season to winter, the wind of the autumn of very very strong. Yet this light and small flower still able to withstand the very harsh strong wind and this small flower indeed has a strong characteristic to survive. When I took a bite. It\'s like so magical! Whatever I was being told about this dish has just brought enlightenment in my mouth. I totally can understand every single thing. The lightness in the cheesecake is like the flower itself. When your knife cuts it down, right in the centre of cake is fruits of forest which is like sorbet kinda texture. And there\'s also hazelnut crunch which represented the strong character of the flower. And yes, this is the most-adored dessert I\'d among the three I\'d tasted.

As the guys in Mad About Sucre said \"Fall in love in Fall\" and I am so in love with this \'Rue Montorguiel\'! A well balanced hand whipped pistachios cream (the best pistachio cream I had so far) with small crunchy pistachios embedded within the cream, the brandied cherry sitting on the liquored-soaked moist-rough texture cake. I am so head over heels with you! In Love!\n<br />#noNeedToSayMore
Gimme crème brûlée anytime! When you scrap it to the end of the dish, you can clearly see the vanilla beans at the end of the dish. It\'s served with the 5 liqueurs marinated orange segments. The fresh berries and freshly chopped mint leaves give refreshing to your tastebuds! Paired with Dutch rose tea with a hint of chrysanthemum and other flavors. #madaboutsucre #jardindumassialot #desserts #sweets #cremebrulee
The cake \'Amour\' totally personifies the inspiration. The white chocolate base, though luscious yet light, plays a perfect ensemble to the Yuzu. Noting that the white chocolate is not overly sweet and the Yuzu is not tart (which is very unusual), this well-balanced dish is an art in itself - a treat for the palate and a feast for the eye.
From the lineup, expect pure dessert fantasy in the forms of chestnut (Montage de Neige), yuzu (Amour), fruits of the forest (Vent de Fleur), earl grey (English Celebration Cake) etc.
The first contact with this interesting and misleading cocktail drink was warm and fuzzy and gradually gave way to the cold liqueur. It was so classy, tasty with a seductive blend of kahlua, milk and some secret-and-hush-hush ingredients. The initial impression was that of a Bailey but mile-high in sophistication and smoothness. A clever concoction, a quiet charmer, a runaway success.
You can felt their effort and love through the food as Mad About Sucre actually make their Sundried tomatoes, own tart shell, and blends their own cheeses concoctions. The condensed flavor of the Sundried tomatoes and the saltiness of the cheeses were such an oral pleasure that made me craved for more helpings, and eventually, another order!
⚠️\n<br />Is it as awesome as their pastries? I must say it definitely is! Chef Eric came up with every dish on the menu inspired from France provincial cooking style. He takes care of every single details from getting quality ingredients to preparation to serving it up on plate singlehandedly. So quality &amp; consistency is there for sure!👍🏻 This is a MUST GET when you are there and I am sure this will be their TOP SELLER in time to come!😌\n<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖\n<br />Thank you Chef Eric for the hospitality last night!😊 Will be back to support again!💪🏻\n<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
Not Instagram-friendly but officially one of my favorite at Mad About Sucre. The melt-in-your-mouth cold smoked loin of wild salmon exudes a flavor and texture that is alike to any aristocrat; its classy yet clean tasting, light yet flavorful, complex yet simple at the same time. It\'s a very tai-tai dish that would even woo the most discerning. Strangely, there is a slight tint of vanilla in that tender-smooth-firm slab of loin that challenges even some of the reputable premium sashimi that I have had in recent times. The creaminess of the cold smoked salmon loin is balanced by the light balsamic vinegar-dressed salad. Such a quiet triumph, such a sleeper hit at Mad About Sucre. French provincial cooking at best!
The fragrance of sweet alcohol is so powerful, baby water crocodile wants to try some. \n<br />Just one of the new items launching at Mad About Sucre next week! Aside from the range of alcoholic hot drinks (!!) sure to satisfy the most degenerate of drunks, the savoury menu will widen eyes and induce exclamations of mmmm.
.\n<br />Luna De Miel 🌙 ( Moon Of The Honey ) - $10.80\n<br />New menu coming up ! So fans of San Domingue and the rest of e current menu , head down to Mad About Sucre soon before they are gone for good.\n<br />#qotn #eatoutsg
Love this version of classic creme brûlée with fruits marinated in liquor. Only at #MadAboutSucre
Thank you for the lovely tea and cake pairing. A little pricey at $10.80 for the cake and $7 for the tea but I\'ll definitely be back!
Attended by friendly staff when we first walk in, and he did a tiny introduction on the different types of cakes. Ordered 3 cakes and was suggested to ordered the 3 types of tea that were being paired with the cakes respectively. Love the French dinning concept in serving the cake. Each cake is a course and staff took time to explain the cake and tea! The cakes taste AMAZING. Well, it\'s on the pricey side as we paid $60++ for 3 cakes +3 diff pot of tea. But I will definitely come back again!!!
After yesterday\'s totally unsatisfying Vongole lunch. Will leave you humming - like a bird - 😋✨😆- loved the juicy plantain bits and extra crunch from pecan nuts in particular.
#qotd #chasingshadow\n<br />.\n<br />San Domingue ( $12.80 ) - 70% single origin chocolate, rum jewel box, caramelized plantain, brittany crunch.\n<br />Everything taste perfect from top to bottom. An absolute crowd pleaser ! And thank u Eric for the great hospitality!
Served with organic tea chosen by the patissier. A perfect match for a relaxing and enjoyable afternoon. The patissier will introduce the cake and tea being served and the best way to taste it. 
The jewel box reveals rum and flows down the throat once you bite it. The aroma of rum which lingers in the mouth, blended with the bitter chocolate mousse ball and together with the secret caramelized banana centre brings you to the next level of experience.
The moist texture of the cake is addictive while the taste is undeniably complex yet simple. The smoothness and velvety of the honey-lavender-lemon Swiss meringue adds further sophiscated subtlety of his wonderful cake. Quite a winner at Mad About Sucre!
It\'s an in-house blend of lemon grass tea, yuzu, French pear, green tea and Camomile. Even the ice in the drink are frozen teas. Such details, as always in @madaboutsucre
Despite possessing neither the SMU-esque professionally proficient attractiveness of the Luna De Miel nor the old school Hollywood glamour of the San Domingue, the Hummingbird proved itself to be, like an industrious and scholarly civil servant, competent and reliable. Essentially a banana cake (one which possesses a highly alluring natural body scent, mind you) with ickle pineapple and nutty bits for crunch and a lemony meringue which leaves a honeyed calling card on your lips. 3.9/5 
almost too beautiful to eat, the creme brulee was a sweet symphony of rich + creamy custard and a crispy layer of burned sugar. the texture was silky and refreshing with the citrus salad! \n<br />the best news is that they have reduced the sweetness level by 50%! less-guilt dessert 🙆
Rarely a dessert brings a smile to my face and this heavenly creation did. Coconut mousse atop a lemon curd tart, what\'s not to like? If I were a Japanese anime character I\'ll be rolling on this pillowy French dessert in ecstasy. This is mouthgasm at its finest.
The lemon curd was smooth &amp; light, non-tangy with visible specks of lemon zest. The coconut mousse was light &amp; fluffy, covered with desiccated coconut. Both the lemon curd and coconut mousse complemented each other, flavours distinctive but yet not overpowering each other.
This one tasted of sweet lingering honey from Alsace, had the depth of cereal milk and tangy blood orange. \n<br />For an additional 7 bucks, it\'s paired delightfully with a French Apple Spanish Blue Ginger Tea. \n<br />Only at @madaboutsucre.
Easily one of the best Creme Brulee I have ever tried as it melts instantly in the mouth. The liqour infused fruits differentiates it from other Creme Brulee desserts I have tried previously. Slightly costly but worth its price. Will definitely be back again to try its lovely looking cakes. The staff makes an effort to explain in detail on how to savour the dessert and the type of tea that goes well with it #burpple #8DAYSEat #ketohloh
The most recognizable offering from Mad About Sucre features a chocolate rum box atop a globe of mousse, hidden plantain &amp; Brittany crunch.
10/10, total score! I would say bring on the alcohol(only in my desserts ok)! I have absolutely trust in @madaboutsucre for creative and delicious desserts, as always! #EileenWantsToCampHereForever #27TeoHongRoad #BakeWithLove #BakeForLove #MadAboutSucre #CremeBrulee #OngsLaiJiak #TheThreeLittleOinks #Desserts #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker
🎉 Pop the rum jewel box into your mouth before savouring the rest of this awesome chocolate bomb made of 70% single origin chocolate, caramelized plantain (🍌) + Brittany crunch base.
with Luna de Miel (Moon of the Honey) 😂. It\'s been three days and I still think about you my loveee. ❤️ Layers of French spring honey mousse, blood orange mousse, grapefruit insert, savore sponge insert, short pastry and blood orange jelly balls!! It is so light and delicate and not overly tart / citric at all! If you have any misgivings about a dessert with orange 🍊🍊🍊 which I did at first!! Mad About Sucre also do tea pairings for their desserts 🍎🍵 and the recommended Apple &amp; Ginger Tea went really well with this cake!
🌹📗🌷🌾🌿✨ I had to take a super close look at them to make sure they weren\'t real lololol
One of Mad About Sucre\'s signatures is the Lunar de Mer (Moon of the Honey), created to represent the first 29 days of a (marriage) union.
Come and hear the story of this cake.... Don\'t tell you here! 
Looking demure and petite in the cake counter, the taste of this dish is giant.
While the initial vertical fork dive delivered a seemingly singular blood orange message, samplings of the various individual components revealed their respective charms – the honey taste was distinct and left a glossy layer of plump and protection on my lower lips that amateur tongue-mopping cannot remove, and the icy, pulpy blood orange insert in the middle was a satisfying shot of citric that added a zing of acid danger to the moussey proceedings. 4/5
Very light vanilla British cake base, heavenly Carpentras strawberry meringue butter cream which was oh so light. One Day Special ! 😋
Essentially an ice cream dream. The mousse has the texture of a light, classy ice cream, the sponge was lighter than a fairy’s wings, while the hazelnut crunch at the base was bitter, sweet and somehow possessed an element of sexy smokiness. 4.2/5 
Spotting a chic and modern look, the taste of the chocolate cake and the liquored condiments of citrus fruit salad, 4-liquored raspberry sauce and white chocolate strawberries are as classic as one can imagine.
The mousse/ ice cream-like texture of the Vanilla mousse elevated the cake to a whole new level, further heightened by the hazelnut crunch that forms the base for the entire cake.
Jardin de Massialot...traditional french creme 🍮🍮brulee (french vanilla, egg🍳, french cream), liquored citrus salad &amp; gold leaf🍂🍂let your imagination run wild or go googoo 😍😙gaga over this awesome dessert. Ooo...b4 i 4get, this goodness has less 50% sugar...so eat without guilt!! #cremebrulee #dessertlovers #dessert #burpple #openricesg #opensnapeats @8days_eat #dessertmasters
This essence of what memories are made of are explicitly reflected in their creme brûlée.
They had exited two of their cakes from their existing menu and introduced another 4 new creations that were launched today!
It\'s like friggin Survivor in this place! This is their new Luna de Miel (Honey of the Moon) - French spring honey mousse, blood orange, savore sponge and short pastry.
One of my favourite cakes here making a second appearance on my feed because it deserves an encore: lemon curd set in a sablée tart, stacked with coconut mousse in a \"fur coat\" of coconut shavings, and finally blinged out with burnished sugar crystals.
Balance is the operative word here. The tartness of the passion fruit sponge soaked with passion fruit \"dew\" strikes a perfect chord with the light cheesecake made from European cheeses.\n<br />Recommended pairing: the in-house blend of Australian bush tea with Cambodian mango and Cambodian pineapple. \n
Carpentras ($11.80) - Layered with almond meringue, vanilla cream, strawberry coulis, topped with white chocolate coated almond crisps in a beautiful martini glass. The different combination flavors in a single spoon work its magic together to create a well balanced and delicate dessert which makes me fell in love immediately! Cheers to the weekends!
One of the most raved-about cakeries for their rich and sophisticated desserts, Mad About Sucre is not one to disappoint. Lovingly handcrafting every cake from scratch with no artificial flavourings and 20-60% reduced sugar, they give you a reason to indulge in more than just one deliciously well-balanced treat. Get the San Domingue ($12.80), a beautiful dome of chocolate mousse with caramelised plantain vanilla cream sitting on a Brittany crunch and topped with a rum-filled chocolate truffle. Do try the Passionne ($10.80) and Moulin Rouge ($10.80); despite having just a few cakes on the menu, each one is just as tantalising as the next!
The owners of Mad About Sucre take their desserts very seriously. For instance, only raw sugar from Mauritius and organic flour are used. That same attention is applied to every other ingredient too. Each is carefully sourced and selected so that together, they form a most sublime experience. \n<br />Naturally for a place so particular about the creation process, they are equally detailed about the way their finished products are best savoured. Therefore, apart from arranging them from the lightest to the richest/heaviest in the chilled display case, the recommendation is that the desserts be served course by course if the plan is to have more than one. Each dessert has its own complementary in-house blend of tea as well.\n<br />On my maiden visit, I started with the Moulin Rouge, its composition listed as: \"slightly charred caramel mousse, walnut parfait, Savore sponge, sweet short pastry\". Doesn\'t it sound heavenly? Well, it certainly lived up to my imagination. Supremely light and delicate, the flavours whispered most articulately.\n<br />The accompanying tea was a blend of Tibetan chamomile, Spanish lemon, chrysanthemum and a touch of Moroccan mint. A very pleasant pairing indeed.

I am sure anyone who walks through their door will feel warmly welcomed and well taken care of.
It is in a martini glass layered with almond meringue, white chocolate, strawberry vodka cream, vanilla cream and almond. Scoop through all the layers and eat them in one mouth to enjoy this sweet treat.
Normally we take pictures of food eaten here... But this time for change! I would like to post picture of me and the men behind the cafe! I must say that I was so overwhelmed by the hospitality of the two bosses of Mad About Sucre. Thank u for your hospitality! 
I love this piece! The coconut topping is a buying point for me! The lemon is not too overpowering and well.... The pure love tea does the magic as well! Nice staff and it\'s always a joy to be here! 
Here\'s a sweet picture of Moulin Rouge, which I took last week at Mad About Sucre. It features lightly charred caramel mousse, walnut parfait, short sweet bread, and almond crunch. Good morning! 🌻 Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/mad-about-sucre/
Handcrafted creations almost to delicate to be devoured.
Read about good reviews abt this and went ahead to try it..did not disappoint at all! Passione cake, 4 layers - passion fruit, cheese, sponge? and the base crust. Paired with a fruit tea highly recommended by the staff. Service was excellent too. Was there on a quiet Thursday night. Loved every bit of the experience there. Will definitely be back again! 
This angelic-looking creation is inspired by Montmarte in Paris, and I can totally see why – both exude a sense of romance and old-world charm that is extremely alluring.
Rum jewel box over a rich chocolate mousse made with 76% single origin chocolate encasing caramelized plantain and vanilla cream sitting over a Brittany cookie crunch. The taste was da bomb... Oh no wonder the shape keke. Thanks @weeteck and @jazpster and nice meeting everyone tonight.
Seductive layers of vanilla and strawberry cream--infused with gin, vodka and bourbon--and fresh strawberry coulis, finished with a raspberry glaze and white chocolate coated almond crisps.
Here\'s the Coco Citron - coconut mousse, lemon curd and sugar crystal drops atop a sablée tart.
The cheese layer here had 4 different types of cheese from different countries! Blown away by this. The passionfruit layer felt so balanced with the cheese. 👌✨👩 And Eric of @madaboutsucre regaled with fascinating stories about how Mad about Sucre came about.
San Domingue, a dome-shaped chocolate mousse made from 70% single origin chocolate, caramelized plantain vanilla cream and brittany crunch.
Probably the first customer of the day that stepped into Mad about Sucre. Love the ambience and impeccable service of the crew, explaining every ingredients and preparation of their products in details.
It\'s finally here!
The people there actually bothered to arrange, in order of lightness, the sequence of the desserts.  With each dessert, they explained the ingredients and how to eat the cakes in order to savor the full flavors and textures. \n<br />This is the Passionné, a passionfruit cheesecake made with 4 types of cream cheese and served with cocoa nibs and gooseberry.  Our favorite of the lot.
One word to describe - \"Lightness\"
 Beautiful, like a piece of art .
Owner asked if I am from some photography club. How to answer ah? \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/03/03/madaboutsucre/
Haha. The difficulties in writing one.
Bittersweet blend of 40% and 60% chocolate from Ghana and Mexico contrasted with rich, punchy tart notes from sour cherry jelly and raspberry coulis in a chocolate tart shell. 😘 #madaboutsucre #readaboutitontheblog
While Mad About Sucre primarily does European-style bespoke tiered cakes, they also offer exquisite bakes at their sophisticated, Parisian-inspired cafe shopfront. Their Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef leads the baking team in achieving sweetness through creative combinations of ingredients, resulting in aesthetically stunning creations that never fail to indulge the senses. Notably, their cakes are served in courses, with the light-tasting cakes always served before the heavier ones - that is the extent of Mad About Sucre\'s dedication to delivering the perfect gustatory experience. Go for the Coco Citron, a combination of lemon curd and coconut mousse, and the San Domingue, an intriguing creation of rum, dark chocolate and bananas.
Am glad to try this yummy dessert before the long holiday ended!! 😄😋
Rum emulsion jewel box, chocolate mousse, caramelized plantain &amp; Brittany cookie crust. Ingredients from around the world brought together by the passionate people behind Mad About Sucre!
From Mad About Sucre. The baker\'s attempt to recreate the perceived flavours of the Moulin Rogue carabet at Paris. It is known that the Moulin Rogue often carried the smell of cigar due to smokers, and the almond crunch stuck at the top was able to bring out the bitterness of smoky flavours very well. The burnt-caramel mousse was a very faint flavour, which allowed the walnut parfait to stand out with its soft nutty flavour. It\'s flamboyant character stands out with the bright red strawberry, which is not only striking in its looks but also gives the dessert it\'s sweet yet tart flavour which twists the otherwise subtle-tasting dessert.
From Mad About Sucre. Essentially a lemon tart with coconut mousse and sugar crystals sitting atop. Have a little of each component in the mouth, and you would find the subtle flavours of coconut combining forces with the tart lemon flavours along with the crystallized sugar which not only looks aesthetically pleasing, but gives the tart a sweet twist in flavour.
Essentially the chocolatey equivalent of Christmas morning. The jewel box reveals liquid rum emulsion by way of in-mouth squirtage once you bite it, and you get to chew the chocolate box with the naughty fluid still swishing around. The relatively bitter chocolate mousse ball has an ice cream-esque texture, and hides a secret caramelized banana centre that is more fruit than mush. Flawlessly executed. 4.3/5
The cake was smooth and rich, with no bitchy upstaging drama going on - the passionfruit dominates for the first few seconds in your mouth but eventually cedes to the cheese at the end. We were told to try the cake by itself and separately with the cocoa nibs for contrast, and I quite enjoyed the cocoa nibs, which tasted sticky and slightly burnt. Quite a triumph. 4.3/5
The interior and the cakes are French inspired, and the staff were very friendly and eager to introduce the different desserts and the method of savouring them properly. Tried the San Domingue which had a nice rum-filled chocolate cube as a \'starter\', and the rich chocolate with the sweet banana centre was a good mix with the crunchy Brittany shortbread base. A bit pricey at $12+ I think, ok for the occasional splurge. Curious to try their other lemon curd with coconut tart someday. #burpple
Mad About Sucre opens its doors today, and we\'re all sorts of excited as it has the perfect blend of Parisian café sophistication, top-notch and sincere service, and exquisite, show-stoppingly beautiful cakes. This is the San Domingue - a jewel box with rum emulsion, chocolate mousse, caramelized plantain and a Brittany crust. #Burpple
So light, I\'m floating on clouds. But then some of the crushed sugar diamonds crackled and popped loudly in my mouth and I was so startled, I fell all the way down. 3.7/5
Congratulations for making into @burpple Hot 100 2018! They are in the TOP 10 for the sweet tooth category 😍 #favoriteplace to always re-visit . Do drop by for a visit! Their POP shop is ending soon!

Essentially a Black Forest cake refiltered by way of Nutella, possessing the icy, wince-inducing tartness of core of a particularly entitled Methodist Girls\' School alumnus. 3.7/5
This indulgent dish is part of Mad About Sucre\'s current Summer menu, which I hear is in its final days before their new Fall/Winter menu is unveiled.

This lovely piece didn\'t fail to gain our oohhss &amp; ahhhhs as we savoured it. Flavors of Spring was paired with Apricot Peach tea\n<br />🍮

This simple and elegant Amour cake would be a good example of how love could be: clean-cut, balanced yet exciting. The beautiful balance of Yuzu and white chocolate for the subtle tanginess and sweetness, on a thin bed of sponge cake for that soft cushion. Complement it with a tea pairing to make it more complete. A touch of love that this would easily bring a smile to anyone. #burpple #burpplesg  #foodgasm #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #peranankan #nonya #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #exploresingapore #yuzu #burpproved

Cut open the pecan mousse to reveal layers of mandarin orange jelly and rum mousse, perfectly balanced when eaten together. \n<br />Love the friendly service and great efforts to explain the concept behind the construct of each cake, and good recommendation of tea pairing for each cake chosen. This Le Caillou aka The Pebble was no doubt one of the most popular choices here. #burpple #burpplesg  #foodgasm #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #peranankan #nonya #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #exploresingapore #cakes
This delightful dish was not a letdown with the smokey succulence of the king prawn which well complimented the lightness of aglio olio. The King prawn is first grilled, then thrown in the oven to give its char grilled flavour an added dimension. We were told that Spanish garlic was incorporated into the pasta to give it an extra kick as it is said to be heavier in flavour than the usual garlic. Would have loved more pasta or an additional King prawn for it\'s price ($29)! #igsg #sgeats #sgfood #burpple #tslmakan #madaboutsucre #igeats #igfood #vsco #vscocam #pasta #aglioolio #seafood

Eric and his team creates every dish with a story to tell.  He prepared the sauce by mixing the eggs with fresh cream, seasonings and freshly grated young parmesan cheese in a bowl. Bacon is then sautéed and mixed with the cooked pasta to pour over the sauce then tossed till coated, allowing the heat of the pasta to just coddle the eggs.  Did I mention that we got extra servings of bacon? *\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />Mad About Sucre, Teo Hong Rd, Singapore\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #nomnomnom #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #getinmybelly #pasta #buzzfeast #food #bacon #instagram #delicious #foodcoma #sinful #eater #cheese #italianfood #burpple #creamy #eeeeats #bbcgoodfood #foodgawker #gastronogram

definitely not \'gelat\'  as compared to other cafes. Highly recommended to try the creme brûlée by itself first and next with the fresh mint and subsequent bites with either strawberry, blueberries or the orange. I took the final bite with the blueberry and mints. Cannot wait for their next season ! And finally thank you for the birthday discount and congrats to your 1st year mark in the F&amp;B industry 😊👍 #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #madaboutsucre #outram

Individually tasting each part before dipping lightly with the citrus sauce, one cannot just appreciate the combination. It does not overpower the salty meat and makes you savour the sweet tangly sauce and does not leave an aftertaste. Where as for the gratin potatoes, it was smooth and melts lightly in the mouth. Adding the sauce again, it just demands for more attention and you realize you have finished it solely in 4 bites 😱 #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #madaboutsucre

A variation of the French Croquembouche which literally means \"something that crunches in the mouth.\" True to its French roots, this technical dessert was done with finesse.
Glued together with French caramel. You can eat this with your fingers. 😆✨👌

Thanks Eric for a nicely prepared Pan seared Foie Gras (from non-force fed geese/ducks) with Apricot Compote, Salad Greens and Mustard Dressing!! Followed by a series of desserts, of course!
A \"Piece Montee\" which means mounted pieces. A mini croquembouche of bite sized choux pastry filled with japanese matcha cream &amp; mascarpone vanilla cream and french caramel, resting on almond sable.

We were instructed to start from the macaron and work our way counter-clockwise to the bitter chocolate coin, which translates to a progression from white chocolate to the bitter chocolates.  One wish big wish is to see the white chocolate with coffee jelly dessert (dessert in the shot glass) on the permanent menu.  The dessert platter is not only visually appealing, it\'s also highly gratifying .  Unfortunately the Pop Shop menu is only available for a period of 3 weeks. I better schedule a visit soon to taste the rest of the menu.

The touch of chilli padi was on point  for our Lo tastebuds.🤓 The smoky bonito flakes was a great addition too.
Aglio olio linguine is cooked separately from the prawn. So you can taste all the individual element on the plate. Al-dente with the right amount of seasoning..every single strand is oh so flavorful &amp; yummy😋. This is what i call foodporn. Head on down to the pop up store now on from Jan 12th to 31st and be wowed by their foods inspired by the travels of the owners. \n<br />It was nice bumping into you.  @larvitar #pasta #kingprawns #seafoods #foodporn #foodstagram #burpple #openricesg #hungrygowhere #i8mondays #8dayseat #iger #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #singaporeeats #stfoodtrending

[Jardin de Massialot S$17.80] - traditional French creme brûlée topped with liquor infused fruits and mint leaves. The idea of mint leaves is brilliant! And the in-house blended tea - melange fifteen is so good!
Paris, the place of love. At first glance you would guess it as mango or maybe banana flavoured. Both wrong! It is yuzu :D 3 layers - yuzu, white chocolate and a soft crust-like bread. Subtlety sweet and there was no hints of white chocolate at all which i totally love. Like a mousse . 😍 #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #Patisseriesg
It has blue cheese, Pitti Gola E Cantina( not sure of the spelling) and another which i cannot remember. Is sorta like a light version of a quiche. To be honest about food places, I usually do not go back more than twice because either the food standard has dropped or the same ambience is not there. And lastly service. Love their special blend of dutch roses. #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #madaboutsucre #Patisseriesg
Their version of the onion soup is surprisingly light as they used chicken stock for the base and you smell the light scent of melted cheese on the toast. The overall result was the best, no aftertaste at all ☺️#foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #madaboutsucre

Fine tea pairing with cake. Totally atas!

It\'s doesn\'t matter because it\'s brandy cake/ fruit cake/ Christmas cake reinvented, in a good natural way. The sweetness of the cake comes from the natural goodness of the fruits in it (think currants, cranberries, apricots etc), heightening the textures and flavors of the warm moist cake.
I can have this anytime of the day ! 👌✨😘

What a refreshing drink to go with a very simple yet well thought of dessert made with Yuzu and white chocolate!! It\'s like going for a good food and wine pairing but it\'s tea and dessert pairing,meticulously served by Eric and James.

There was 2 kinds of cheese at least. 👌✨😘
The white chocolate mousse was super smooth &amp; creamy whereas the yuzu mousse provided a very citrussy tangy &amp; refreshing burst to the palate. A very light &amp; I really mean light not sweet dessert. Truly enjoyed this.😄 Always amazing to see seasonal cakes every now n then. #dessertlovers #dessert #sgfoodie #yuzu #mousse #burpple #openricesg #bloggerssg #seasonal \n<br />Time well spent especially with such great company. Thank you Eric &amp; James @madaboutsucre for the wonderful conversations, the warm hospitality &amp; always showing so much love every time i pop by😍
So I decided to give it a try! I ordered 3 different desserts from the lightest to the strongest in flavours. And 3 different in house tea pairing with each dessert. In another words, I had 3 course desserts! This is of course the last course. San Domingue which was paired with a tea to wind down that has some lemongrass in it. Every single tea served are all in-house blend with has several flavours in a tea. Good news is that they\'re launching to sell their tea blends in 10 days! Totally love their tea. This some shaped San Domingue has mousse made from 70% single origin chocolate, a rum jewel box on the top, caramelised plantain vanilla cream and brittany crunch. At every course, the service staff would explain to you what you would expect from this dessert or a story behind this creation. And secondly to educate you on how to fully enjoy the dessert. For San Domingue, first pop that jewel box in your mouth to create a rich sensation. Take a spoonful of every ingredients in this pastry and let them play with your sensory of taste! San Domingue has been existed since the first season of their launch and are still selling very well till date! #madaboutsucre #desserts #chocolate #sweets #pastry

To temind us Life still can be sweet.
The jewel box on top produces an influx of rum that compliments the bitterness of the chocolate mousse and goes well with the brittany crunch. I was awed by their pretty cake decorations and presentation on a whole. It gives a cosy feel and the owner, Eric was extremely hospitable.

Best dessert I\'ve tasted in years!! 
Cakes baked for the love for quality cakes . Love the cakes and pairing with tea.. The cakes are well balanced in their flavours...can taste the thoughts and efforts behind them... Though pricey but they are definitely worth every penny and calorie.  
But then again that\'s the life isn\'t it!
The artisans who made these mean serious business when they source for the best ingredients combining with their skillf training in Paris to create this sinful indulgence. Need I say more? Kudos to the Team! I love their French butter cookies too. \n<br />Mad About Sucre, Singapore

Cheers to the weekend. :) the crisp layer of burnt sugar broke apart to reveal spoonfuls of French creme that was smooth and slid down the throat with ease. Pick a different fruit with every spoon for a myriad of textures and tastes! #cafesg #cafe #cafehopping #sgcafe #madaboutsucre #dessert #foodgasm #foodporn #foodstagram #cremebrulee #alcoholic #onthetable #burpple #whati8today #8dayseat #omyfoodie #instasg #igsg #instafood
I did not miss cream cheese frosting on this. It\'s just simply delish with their Swiss meringue cream.👌✨😻
Looking back, they really have nice cakes.  Made with high quality ingredients made skilfully and best of all, will love. \n<br />Mad About Sucre, Teo Hong Street, Singapore

cut it apart and you will find great surprise, a layer of jelly-alike blood orange which was icy and refreshing! ain\'t the layering too pretty to be eaten?

In summary, FREAKING AMAZING. #madaboutsucre #burpple
Whoever came up with the chocolate banana combination is a genius because it\'s just awesome. \n<br />Monster is a chocoholic!\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
But I believe it is serving with a passion. I sincerely felt it ( and no I\'m not going ga-ga over nothing) #kudos #madaboutsucre #awesomeservice #burpple #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg
I love anything with chocolate and this was no exception. The one who served us very enthusiastically what was in my choice of dessert and how we should eat it in every bite and boy it was pure bliss! I am pretty glad for the reduced sugar content because I can taste the various flavours coming together, the rum in my first bite and the second was the chocolate mousse with vanilla cream and mini core of banana mush and shortbread crust. Can\'t wait to come for another visit! #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #sweet
I really liked how well the different components of Mad About Sucre\'s new cake went together.  Service continues to be top notch.  Will be back again for sure.
A british cake, chocolate🍫, creme de cassis, french raspberry &amp; strawberry🍓🍓🍓 liquored condiments. Abit dense with creme in between and crowned with minty white chocolate. Goes well with the slightly sourish tangy raspberry sauce.  The strawberry half covered with white choco was delish. Yumz😋😋 #cakes #cakes #dessertlovers #dessert #burpple #openricesg #snacks #sgblogger @madaboutsucre #dessertmasters
5-liquor marinated citrus fruits of the Spring gardens accompanying an age-old Classical recipes, except that we reduced the sweetness level by 50%.... Happy days! #MadAboutSucre @madaboutsucre #bakewithlovesg #bakeforlovesg #naturalingredients #27teohongroad #sgcakes #burpple #hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #bespokecakesg #cakerysg #couturecakeshopsg
An inspiration from the Parisan quartet that presents majorly forgotten works and neglected composers from the Classical and Romantic era. This cake reflects the warm and deep notes of the strings and bows with natural ingredients of Madagascar vanilla, Corsican almonds and Algerian hazelnuts.

Easily manageable by two diners, with space enough for something else.
It means the first 29 days of a honeymoon, wishing sweet love like honey for couples... I love the blood orange caviar and cold blood orange centre in this creation. They even do bespoke creations upon requests too...😊#food #foodies #foodporn #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgcafes #igsg #igfood #instafood #foodstagram #foodphotography #eatoutsg #burpple #foodgasm #foodbloggers #foodpics #instasg #instafoodsg #whati8today #misschocoholic #foodpic #tinlicious #theinfluencernetwork #openricesg #sgcafefood #madaboutsucre @madaboutsucre #dessert #dessertporn
It was finished too quickly, so light yet satisfying with each mouthful of blood orange essence.
In celebration of 🌻🌹🍂spring/summer....this is french spring honey mousse with savore sponge and blood 🍊orange embedded in the middle...resting on a very (trust me) delectable thin crisp short pastry and crowned with blood orange 🍊pearls.😍😋 so smooth so light so madaboutsucre!!\n<br />#cakelovers #dessert #dessertlovers #foodstagram #pastry #burpple #openricesg @8days_eat #sgblogger #opensnapeats\n<br />Shout out to Eric &amp; James @madaboutsucre ...thank you for the love &amp; warmth you give  everytime I am there.

Not only the desserts tasted good, I was impressed by their exceptional service despite this being a takeaway order.

Second stop of the day at this French-styled patisserie. We ordered the 5 courses of cakes, each pair with a wonderful pot of tea. Featuring here is Passionne ($10.80) that is made of 4 different types of cheese and has the passionfruit flavour.
Such smooth mousse . Ooh la la !
A must have if you are a chocolate freak....
😀✨👌
The cheesecake was light and comes with a nice fruity flavour from passion fruit. A very clever play of flavours but yet nicely balanced.
A very well balanced execution.
Just perfection in the balance of taste and textures.
An excellently executed cheesecake comprising a blend of four cheeses and passionfruit-infused sponge on a crisp base of shortcrust pastry. So smooth and rich in texture, yet retrained in flavour and not at all cloying. And those cracked shards of cocoa nib pralines aren\'t just for decoration – they taste spectacular, too.
I feel the white is so beautiful!!
All the layers are so distinct yet well balanced . 🍸🍓
So beautiful so yummy loh. Eating the cake alone and eating it together with the fried chocolate totally is a different feel. Try it if you are nearby!
My fav was the San Domingue, a dark chocolate bauble of caramelized plantain and fine chocolate mousse, topped with a shot of rum encased within a chocolate box. #madaboutsucre
When the jewel box burst, the Rum taste is OMG!!! Simply just love all the pretty stuffs there!! 😍😋
We love our trip in Cappadocia. I will have a red flower on my hairdo and my hub will wear an Aqua-blue suit. Dun tell us your design, dun tell us the flavors, just surprised us......\' This was a 3-sentence emailed brief for a wedding cake....totally stressed out by this very-brief brief. In the end, we are very happy that the busy couple was smiling ear to ear when they saw the cake, and they chomped off the edible hot air balloon too :) love the energies of the young! @madaboutsucre #weddingcakesg #weddingtieredcakesg #fondantartsg #fondanttieredcakesg #sgbakes #sgtieredcakes #sgcustomisedcakes #bespokecakerysg #couturecakeshopsg #cakeryinsg #customisedcakesg #sgbrides #bridesg #weddingssg #sgweddings #naturalingredientscakesg #sgfoodporn #instacakesg #bakeforlovesg #bakewithlovesg #instasg  #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instacakesg #27teohongroad #sgfoodies #weddingssg #instacake_sg #burpple #sgcafehopping
