I didn\'t know that proper okonimyaki recipe uses (quite a substantial amount of) ginger and so I ended up cringing slightly upon biting the ginger. But that aside, I pretty much enjoyed the okonomiyaki and it was rather filling too.
Yum yum. Finally managed to try this. Kinda cool to have someone do all the cooking for you. I think ginger was added to it, not to my liking. If you\'re not a ginger fan, please tell them not to add it. 
So excited to watch this fresh squid being grilled in front of us. While it might be sinful with loads of butter on the teppanyaki board, the squid came out really fragrant and pretty smoky. You can dip it in the chilli mayonnaise provided, but I rather eat it bare without any dressing. Only then can you fully taste the freshness and sweetness of the squid.
Aside from the classic okonomiyaki and Monjayaki offered, Seiwaa‚Äôs teppanyaki squid was two-thumbs up. Prepared by the staff right in front of our eyes, the sizzling squid was cooked perfectly. Both plump and sweet, a point definitely worth mentioning was that the squid was grilled with butter, BUTTER which gave a really nice fragrance to each chewy bite as well. It tasted great on its own, but having it together with a little mayo and chili flakes served at the side was the icing on the cake.
Apart from their okonomiyaki and monjyayaki, Seiwaa serves some pretty good side dishes like this giant squid. Similarly, the squid is cooked and sliced on the grill right in front of you, ensuring that its served fresh and hot. The squid was of a good texture and well-cooked, and is good as an appetiser which you can nom on while they cook the main dishes for you. 
Freshly-cooked okonomiyaki right in front of your eyes! While they also serve monjyayaki (which is a wetter version), I prefer the okonomiyaki as it feels more substantial. Specifically, the seafood okonomiyaki which comes with chunks of prawn and squid mixed into the batter was the tastiest cause it adds more texture to the pancake (as opposed to just plain lettuce). Good for sharing!
Once our friendly Japanese staff gave us the much-anticipated ‚Äòok‚Äô sign, we promptly gathered around the hot grill plate armed with our cute mini-spatulas all ready to dig in. The best way to enjoy this sizzling mix monjayaki was obviously to eat directly off it!\n<br /> \n<br />The savory-sweet mixture of pork, squid and shrimp pressed down and spread thinly across the plate had it quickly crisping up on the bottom. Absolutely no regrets at all agreeing to the waitress‚Äô suggestion to top up for cheese ($3) as that melty gooey goodness further enhanced the overall texture. Other top ups available include mochi, mentaiko and more.\n<br /> \n<br />Now, what‚Äôs the difference between Monjayaki and the more familiar Okonomiyaki? Monja uses more liquid ingredients and a softer batter while the Oko is drier, firmer and has a thicker stack of ingredients piled all together. The latter wins by appearance hands down but I was more impressed by the flavourful Monja here. Another one of my favourites was the Teppanyaki Squid ($15).\n<br /> \n<br />Seiwaa serves up authentic Japanese comfort food worth trying, though at a slightly hefty price tag (especially if you‚Äôre one who needs more carbs to be filled up). \n<br /> \n<br />Tip: Download the J Passport mobile app and get a complimentary Monjayaki with any Okonomiyaki purchased!

You know how sometimes you\'re so excited to sink your teeth into soft, tender squid but meet with a rubbery tough texture? So glad it was not the case at Seiwaa! In fact, the fresh squid was grilled perfectly well by the skillful Japanese staff. The alluring buttery aroma had all our stomachs grumbling like crazy even before it was fully cooked. Don\'t underestimate the unassuming dollop of mayo with chilli flakes at the corner right there because it went surprisingly well with the squid (and this is coming from a non-mayo fan). Pricey but surely worth the try!  
This beautiful mess you see in front of you is monjyayaki, which is the wetter sibling of okonomiyaki. The batter is runny, and stays wet on the top, while the bottom will slowly form a crisp layer. If you like it a bit thicker, you can wait for it to cook a bit longer to give it more time to set. As with the okonomiyaki, I think the seafood is the best option along with cheese as a topping ($3) as it gives it more flavour, body and texture. A tiny metal spatula is provided so you can scrape and eat it directly off the grill. While delicious, I personally prefer okonomiyaki since its more substantial/filling than the monjyayaki. Either way, it still tastes good!
Butter grilled squid that was delicious. Squid was fresh and cooked perfectly, not chewy but had a good bite. Not that cheap at $15, perfect to share!
It\'s rare to find a restaurant that serves freshly-made Okonomiyaki on the table in front of your eyes, but that\'s how Seiwaa serves their Okonomiyaki ‚Äî all at the table from before the ingredients are mixed into a batter all till it is cut to your plate. The result was pretty fresh with crunchy greens and fresh prawns and squid for the seafood rendition that we have got without the greasiness that Okonomiyaki usually gets soaked in for the Pasar Malam variants. Even the sauces are drenched onto the Okonomiyaki in moderation; enough to taste without overwhelming the pancake ‚Äî certainly one of the places I would recommend for a fun gathering for the pan-frying of the Okonomiyaki is bound to be a talking point amongst a group of friends.
Uploading this first because I filmed the making of the Okonomiyaki in video mode. Apart from the freshly-made Okonomiyaki where they prepare in your eyes at your table, the light bites are also quite decent. These wings are absolutely delish with the crisp, lightly fried batter that is coated with a savoury yet lightly sweet sauce which gets better with every bite as you get through with the juicy, succulent meat. Thought the service is pretty good here too, especially the friendly Japanese staff who pan-fried the Okonomiyaki for our table who attended to our every needs and query.
This squid is big, tender and sweet, hence well worth the money (tap on the location geotag to see photos of the full squid). You can dip that squid in your choice of chilli mayo or ginger shoyu.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />In the centre of your table is this large metal teppanyaki plate, which is where the okonomiyaki would be cooked in front of you. The okonomiyaki is crispy on the bottom with a playful mix of various ingredients inside (tip: add bacon into the okonomiyaki).\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Monjayaki was interesting too, it\'s like a big pancake, to be scrapped bit by bit directly from the hot cooking plate with a tiny spoon and eaten while it\'s hot. The first few spoons is more starchy, while the last few spoons more crispy.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Great price for this casual cosy restaurant. And after dinner, be sure to check out the nearby Roots Kitchen Bar too, it\'s a quiet and beautifully decorated cafe that serves desserts reasonably priced.
Definitely make you \'Sei\' WAAAAA üòé‚úåüèªÔ∏è Partnering with @jpassportsg, you get to enjoy a free Monjayaki with an order of Okonomiyaki. \n<br />And I have to say, the Monjayaki was definitely a Super good experience to have. It is a \'wetter\' version of Okonomiyaki where you use small spade-like cutlery to scoop up small amount and shove it straight into your mouth!!! Fun fact: Okonomiyaki are from Osaka while Monjayaki are enjoyed by people from Tokyo ü§î
Like... Whao... We were caught completely off guard by this quiet place with their great dishes and unique offerings! You\'ll want to get their Monjayaki which is this cool pancake like thing (it\'s so hard to describe) but that deserves its own post.
So darn good! Smoky, garlicky, perfect. Studded with chunks of salmon and strips of bacon. A must order. Also, their set lunches go for just $10, would highly recommend their chicken curry rice or the buta pork bowl! Generous servings and very tasty. This spot is a hidden gem we\'ll return to for sure.
This may not look great, but it was so much fun and so tasty! It\'s ingredients are much like Okonomiyaki, with a base of shredded cabbage. It\'s first fried with Sakura ebi and beef cubes, before a well is made and a thick, saucy mixture is poured in the middle. Everything is mixed and spread flat on the hotplate. The cheese is then sprinkled on top and melts into the mix, while the bottom crisps up in a way that reminds you of crispy mee sua, orh luak, claypot rice and San lou beehoon all at the same time! You\'re given these cute little spoons to scrape and eat straight off the hotplate. Such fun, and a great new experience of a comfort food from Tokyo! 
Saaaaay whaaaaat? Certified hidden gem on the streets of Little India. I felt like I had been brought on a fantastical journey of colourful sights, tastes and smell. Excellent value for money for most of the items we tried, including the okonomiyaki, salmon &amp; bacon fried rice, and a very unique Tokyo-style monjayaki w cheese
Both sizzled their way to perfection. Every bite of each was savoury~ Okonomiyaki was classic and fluffy. The squid was grilled and each bite was chewy,  best I ever eaten! The staff were really friendly and attentive too! Yummy score 4.5/5

Since my trip to Osaka in 2014, I\'ve been hunting for an Okonomiyaki that\'s enough to satisfy my cravings. And man, this blew my üê∞ paws off üëãüèªüå¨üòÇ / \n<br />Was impressed with the crispy light batter, fresh cabbage and tiny squid bits, which are not chewy at all. Not the mention, the sauces, mayo and bonito flakes are FREE FLOW. It was darn shiok to spam my pancakes with the bonito doing its boogie! üòõ Service was also immaculate. I need to bring my fam here for a pancake tossing party üéâ üòå Highly recommend this place if you are an Okonomiyaki fan! #dontsaybojio #okonomiyaki #japanesefood #osakaeats #bonitoflakes #burpple
It was an enjoyable experience having to cook your own okonomiyaki on the flat iron griddle before adding your own garnish. There are a few okonomiyaki options but my recommendation is to go for the mixed one which contains shrimp, squid and pork. Crispy on the outside while having a warm fuzzy feeling on the inside as you bite into it.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Seiwaa Okonomiyaki &amp; Teppanyaki\n<br />Address: 72, Dunlop Street, Singapore 209400 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg
You can even cook the Japanese pancake yourself with a grill on your table, plus add on your desired toppings! Check it out!\n<br />~\n<br />Read the full review at http://eatbook.sg/seiwaa-okonomiyaki/\n<br />~\n<br />Writer: @hotcheekylace\n<br />Photographer: @marktankai
It comes with pork, squid and prawns that was a great mix with crunchy shredded cabbage!
Monja uses exactly the same ingredients as okonomiyaki, but what differentiates them is dashi. The stock used turns monja into a wet version of okonomiyaki, and thus, a different way of serving too! You can (or perhaps, have to) scrape monja using a mini teppanyaki spatula directly from the teppanyaki griller. Its texture reminds me of grilled cheese, burnt on one side but melting on the other side. And although it looks like nothing much to fill your stomach, in my opinion, monja beats okonomiyaki any time as it bursts with strong flavours ‚Äî  from both the dashi and the toppings!\n<br />*\n<br />p/s: a close up shot of the monjayaki next time!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpproved #burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #monjayaki #food #japan #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood
This squid ($15) was pretty darn good! The fun (or not-so-fun part if you\'re famished) was watching it sizzle as they cook it right before your eyes. This succulent, tasty squid was cooked perfectly with the right amount of chewiness so I don\'t feel like I\'m having a battle inside my mouth - was well-worth the wait! Also, the side dip of spicy mayo which went surprisingly well together deserves a mention - I don\'t even like mayoüòÇ.
Go for the Okonomiyaki with pork as the bacon crisp up nicely under the hot grill and lends a savoury saltiness to the dish. Prices range from $10 to $16 (mix which has squid, shrimp, pork). The place isn\'t well ventilated so be prepared to smell like BBQ! 
I was like so \"zoned out\" that I cannot remember whether this was a okonomiyaki or a monjayaki. All I could do was just let my video camera do its thing....aim n shoot. \n<br />But one thing for sure, this tasted good except that it was alittle heavy. \n<br />It was fun looking at the flakes do their exotic swaying.\n<br />Thank you @that_dex @coolheart @i_post_for_love for being so understanding towards my \"out in space\" moodüò©. Please feel free to comment what I ate cos my mind last nite was a total blank. Thoroughly enjoyed the food, desserts and awesome companyüòÑ\n<br />#dinnerwithfriends #friendship #cafehoppers #i8mondays #opensnap #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #burpplesg #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #narratrs #sgig#tripadvisor #discoversg
Itadakimasu! Prepared right in front of us by an authentic Japanese staff, who\'s both friendly &amp; courteous üòä üáØüáµ You can never go wrong with an Okonomiyaki. It\'s no doubt an any-time, any-day kinda comfort food üòã
