The first thought that came to me after the first taste was \"that\'s amazing!\" It started with a punch, as though a piquant note that rushes to the tip of your nose but grew into a more smoothing subtle taste to the palette. Quite smooth a texture with a light tinge of creaminess. Something different that will excite your taste buds!  
Ice cream will never be the same again! I\'m so impressed by the fragrant toast that complemented the Ferrero Rocher ice cream and Nutella drizzle so well! On a side note, the Thai earl grey ice cream is really rich too, go try it!
Coconut on soursop kind of love.
White truffle ice-cream over a very crisply done waffle. My love for savoury flavours was reafffirmed as I personally liked the unique ice-cream flavour a lot, and together with the waffle, it was like a match made in heaven to my tastebuds (think truffle waffles)! 🍦😋👍
Their thick toast is dope! Will definitely come back for more!
Virgin visit to Dessert Project turned out to be a very fruitful one. 
A project I would love to engage in everyday.
Nutella thick toast with ferrero rocher and vanilla. Waffle with baileys and biscotti
Found the crust slightly too chewy, but within those brown walls was an impossibly soft and cottony interior that melted in the mouth – quite like cotton candy. Soaked with a copious amount of gula Melaka, the whole thing might have been too rich and sweet, if not for the ultra-silky coconut ice cream that added a cool, welcome contrast of freshness.
I would say this is one of the better toast in SG. 😋
It is slathered with generous amount of sticky toffee sauce, chopped nuts over the toast and paired with Vanilla and their new flavour, Cookie &amp; Crema ice cream. Love how the warm toast slowly melts the smooth creamy ice cream, blending with the sticky toffee sauce for rich flavors and gives a cool-hot decadent feel to the mouth. With just the right balance of sweetness and texture, this toast will definitely makes a fabulous and indulgent treat for anyone! Definitely one of the better toast in Singapore!
Thick buttered toast covered with dripping Nutella sauce, chopped nuts and topped with vanilla &amp; Ferro Rocher ice cream.
Really shiok toast! Warm buttery toasted bread with ice cream is always a winner. This toast comes with vanilla and coffee ice cream. I love sweet stuff so I regretted not substituting the coffee ice cream with other flavours! Chopped peanuts added a nice crunch to the dish. The bread is nicely toasted, fluffy inside, with butter slathered evenly throughout. The two things that make it fall beneath After You\'s shibuya toast is the lack of fragrance from the bread and the weak whip cream. Priced at $14.90. Love ice cream parlours that produce good quality and innovative ice cream flavours so #bestfoodmemory2015
The homemade coconut ice cream turns out refreshing and enjoyable.\n<br />|\n<br />I was pleasantly surprise at how soft and buttery the toast is, while still being crispy on the surface. The toast was overall buttery enough for me. Though nothing comes close to matching them to After You\'s Shibuya Toast, but imho this is one of the better ones I had in sg, not even from Dazzling. 😉
Need a dose of ice cream to cool us down in this warm and stuffy weather!
On a side note, it\'s hard to find good Pistachio ice cream but #dessertprojectsg homemade Pistachio ice cream is worth trying :)
seems like the latest trend in SG. the outer layer coated with toffee sauce was crispy, \n<br />crusty with the right hardness (hard enough yet not to the extent of breaking your teeth). the inside was soft and fluffy - a good balance of external crunch and internal fluffiness. the staff were also nice to change one of the ice cream flavour to caramel biscuits! \n<br />one thing to note though, you gotta eat it as fast as you can, as it tends to get soggy eventually. \n<br />so despite being one of the better toast in SG, it still cannot beat my favourite Shibuya Honey toast from After You Cafe. so what is missing? well, I guess the internal texture wasn\'t as fluffy as the one from After You, and it got pretty plain without butter.
The adventurous me decided to attempt 2 exotic flavours and it\'s like stuffing melon, parma ham and truffle together in my mouth at the same time. But nothing as weird as attempting truffle with lemon mint. 😵
At Dessert Project, ice cream is no longer just paired with the usual cones or waffles, but with a 3-inch thick pillowy toast with crispy edges. Expect exotic and innovative flavours such as Thai Earl Grey, White Rabbit Candy and, wait for it, White Truffle. These scoops are stacked onto toasts ($13.90-$14.90) smeared with Nutella, sticky toffee sauce, gula Melaka, etc. and two scoops of complementing ice cream flavours. This is one decadent dessert! 
Places with exotic ice cream flavours never fails to excite me. Went straight for the melon with Parma ham and white truffle. Partly because I was quite intimidated to try other flavours. Was really impressed with both though the former could simply be melon ice cream. Good creamy texture to the ice cream! I enjoyed the ice cream thoroughly although my friend commented that the white truffle tasted like engine oil and the melon got too soapy after a while (both I disagreed with). My ultimate regret was not putting any sauce on the waffle, thinking my savoury ice cream would pair best with a plain waffle. How wrong was I. Their waffle is very plain and I can tell you now, the flavours I picked do not match a plain waffle. I had a hard time finishing the waffle. I must say that the waffle is very well made though, and I would have loved to have the toffee sauce on it to truly judge the waffle. There was a huge lunch crowd on a weekday but thinned quickly after two. 
This new desserts cafe opened just a while back, and I\'ve already heard so much positiveness about it that I just had to head down and order one toast myself asap. Reached at 1+pm and the place was packed. Returned again after half an hour before we got a seat. Ordered their nutella toast which comes with a standard scoop of vanilla and ferrero rocher ice cream. Can\'t change the standard scoops, but I just had to order an additional scoop of one of their interesting flavours I\'ve heard so much about. Settled for the white truffle.. which was the best man omg. I felt as though I was eating truffle fries, but then eh ice cream. so good we were literally fighting over it. 😍😍 The toast was not bad itself, fluffy inside and not too crispy on the outside like how i liked it. The ferrero rocher and vanilla ice cream was good but more normal imo. Total bill tgt with a cuppa cost around $20 i rmb. Verdict: Definitely going back again for their other toasts, waffles and of course ice cream!! 🙆
Love the waffles which is crispy &amp; good. Love the ice cream which is strong in flavors! 😋😋
don\'t expect this to be the flowing lava type, because this version came with molten hot chocolate fondant in the centre.\n<br />the devilishly cake was lip smacking with  white truffle ice cream! the strong and distinctive white truffle with the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate is a timeless flavour 😍\n<br />I will never have the same satisfaction from lava cake + vanilla ice cream anymore.\n<br />Monday is down! so say YAY because long weekend is nearing. love the short work week (3 more days)!
rocher ice cream hit all the right notes, but again the toast failed to live up to the hype. more butter inside is required, I feel.
3 inch thick buttered toast with Coconut &amp; Baileys ice-cream, a slice of pineapple, maple syrup drizzle &amp; topped with chopped peanuts. Served with a dollop of whipped cream at the side.
Nutella toasts comes with ferror rocher and vanilla ice cream. Had a chocolate lava cake with \"famous Amos\" ice cream. Been going there very frequently because I\'m super in love with their ice cream and I want to try all the flavors available. Creamy and full of flavor. My fave has gotta be matcha, ferror and biscotti ❤️❤️
Yum yum in my tum tum with this Nutella Toast! Worth getting if you love indulging in diabetes. 🍴👍
Comes with Coconut &amp; Baileys Ice Cream. Pluck up my courage to have this as my alcohol level is 0%. But somehow I like the Baileys Ice Cream!! 😋😋
It is slathered with generous amount of Nutella, chopped nuts over the toast and paired with Ferraro Rocher and Caramel Biscuit ice cream. Love how the warm toast slowly melts the smooth creamy ice cream, blending with the sweet Nutella for rich flavors and gives a cool-hot decadent feel to the mouth. With just the right balance of sweetness and texture, this toast will definitely makes a fabulous and indulgent treat for any Nutella lover.
Boy oh boy had I never thought that Truffle could be an ice-cream flavour, let alone falling in love with such eccentric flavour! It\'s part sweet (perhaps a white chocolate base?), part truffle taste profile is simply amazing, and even the truffle part puts some truffle fries to shame! Chocolate Lava Cake didn\'t flow, but that\'s because the chocolate within is so thick and rich it was gooey and came in globs. The combination of White Truffle ice-cream with Chocolate Lava Cake sort of reminds me of Sea Salt Brownies; a harmonious combination indeed!
Located at Havelock Road, Dessert Project offers some unique ice cream flavours. The usual vanilla ice cream that was paired with the toast was not available hence they suggested caramel biscuit which was really a blessing in disguise because it was rich and it reminded me of sweet caramel popcorn. Good for sharing, the toast was drizzled... no slathered with nutella and the crisp exterior went well with the soft buttered interior of the warm thick bread.
Never dying love for dessert, came back for the thick toast dessert 2 days in a row. They ran out of Azuki beans for my matcha toast, so we chose the Sticky Toffee toast, but paired with pistachio and ferrero rocher ice cream.
Been back for the dessert at this place couple of time!! One thing that never fail is the toast with ice cream! Enjoy the toast and waiting time is short! Would prefer toast to be filled with something else instead of butter but can\'t complain! 
The cray cray weather calls for a Nutella Thick Toast with After Eight and Cookies &amp; Cream ice cream, nicely paired with a glass of iced cold Mango Sticky Rice tea from Ette Tea.
Saltiness from the butter with sweetness from the nutella and ice cream paired with crispiness from the exterior of the toast. 😋😋😋 We said it is one of the better toast in Singapore, what abt you?
the rich truffle taste exploded in my mouth, and I feel as though I am gargling my mouth with truffle oil, without any oil that is. truffle-lover will definitely be hooked by this. \n<br />watermelon sorbet was so refreshing, and it feels as though I am eating ice-blended watermelon! the best thirst quencher for me.
🍟 The taste was really rich and super legit but after awhile, it got a bit too much to keep tasting mouthfuls of truffle. Also ended up really really really wanting to dip fries into it HAHA (might be less overwhelming paired with waffles). +++ 2⃣ Pistachio ice cream which was also mad epic awesome in its nuttiness. Like having the real thing! Not a big fan of the 3⃣ Lemon Mint Crush 🍋🌿 but that\'s just personal preference. Sampled the 4⃣ Moscato flavor 🍇 and the alcoholic friend @beaverwoo wanted to buy a whole pint home!! HAHA. Next time when we come back for Parma Ham and Melon 🍉🍉🍉 // it was sold out this week #sadface
I like the crispness of the waffles. Also their ice cream! Melon &amp; Parma Ham 
Waffle $5.90 crisp light tasty! White truffle $4.20 Parma ham and melon $3.80 pistachio $3.80. Total $18. Generous scoops that held their shape.
A variety of exotic ice cream flavours available. Love their durian and thai earl grey flavours. 2 scoops of ice cream with waffle at $13.90.
This time rnd is a Watermelon + Peppermint Chocolate flavors. So good. I\'m loving them!! 😄😋
2 crisp, buttery waffles with 4 scoops of ice cream. We tried:
And who\'s USINE? 😜 Waffles with Truffle, Rock Melon &amp; Parma, Rocher, and After Eight. The rock melon rocks! 😘
Back for the amazing White Truffle ice cream and also tried their classic waffles. We picked the After Eight, Ferrero Rocher, Parma Ham Melon and White Truffle flavours. The classic waffle was lightly crisp on the outside and feature a doughy interior, which is just the way I like it.
Finally someone up the dessert game by introducing White Truffle and Melon &amp; Parma Ham in ice cream (super good). You will be intrigued to discover some of the most unique ice cream flavours at this new neighborhood dessert bar.
The Baileys and After Eight did what was expected of them like professionally obedient trained puppies, but the White Rabbit Candy was a memorable blast from the past, recreating that signature milkiness in your mouth like a milk ice ball time capsule. 3.8/5
Joining the buzzy Jalan Bukit Ho Swee estate area is Dessert Project, an ice cream parlour offering bold and fresh ice cream flavours. While the usual classic flavours ($3.80 per scoop) like Mango, Coconut and Matcha are available, the premium flavours ($4.20 per scoop) which include Thai Earl Grey -- a daring combination of Thai Milk Tea and Earl Grey — and Melon &amp; Parma Ham (!!) are certainly intriguing and worth a try. Definitely go for the wonderfully nostalgia-inducing White Rabbit Candy flavour ($3.80).
Tried the White rabbit candy, baileys, after eight (chocolate, mint)! Must say they got a lot of really interesting flavours! Such as melon plus Parma ham! Truffle ?!? Will be back to try the other flavours too! Their classic is $3.80 while the premium flavours are $4.20! #burpple
Situated in the old Tiong Bahru estate, was this ice cream parlor that offers up to 20 flavors of ice cream including exotic ones such as, Thai earl grey, white rabbit candy, white truffle, ferrero rocher, mao shan wang durian, lemon &amp; Parma ham, lemon mint crush, bailey\'s and \"after eight\'s\" mint chocolate and many more.         Chocolate mint, baileys and white rabbit candy were ordered and my personal favorite was the chocolate mint as it did not have the much feared toothpaste taste and the chocolate bits that lie within the ice cream was able to release small bursts of chocolate sweetness with each bite! The white rabbit candy ice cream was able to replicate the taste of the original candy itself and yet not making it too sweet as an ice cream! The Bailey\'s ice cream was although not anything exotic, but it was well balanced and did not a strong alcoholic taste to it! Each scoop costs $3.80 ($4.20 for premium ones) and don\'t be shy to ask the staff or owners to try out the different flavors as they are a friendly bunch of people! 
The Baileys and After Eight did what was expected of them like professionally obedient trained puppies, but the White Rabbit Candy was a memorable blast from the past, recreating that signature milkiness in your mouth like a milk ball time capsule. 3.8/5 
Another new hunt near home, swung by to check out what\'s in store tonight. Spotted some unusual flavours, and immediately asked to try:\n<br />(1) White Truffle - whoa! intense, probably too much for a whole scoop on your own;\n<br />(2) Melon &amp; Parma Ham (that white one at the back) - refreshing, sorbet-like melon flavour that melts away into salty parma bites, very interesting;\n<br />(3) Thai Earl Grey - I\'m a tea addict, so I\'m totally biased. Got a pint of this to-go, had forgotten all about my other love, the Salted Caramel!\n<br />🍦 Scoop: S$3.80 (reg) | S$4.20 (*premium)\n<br />🍦 Pint: S$15 (reg) | S$18 (*premium)\n<br />Thick toasts and waffles available too.

❤️ #MyLoveForThickToasts has gotta staaahhhp 😭😭😭/ Review of @dessertprojectsg is up! And it\'s great news delivered for all those obsessed with #AfterYou (like me) living in Singapore WHEE~ 🎉🙆🏼 This is their Nutella Toast with an extra scoop of Thai Earl Grey cos it\'s too awesome not to have it 😳
Errr, I personally feel that it\'s a bit odd to have ice cream with that strong truffle taste. The other scoop was ferrero rocher. Waffle was not bad!\n<br />.\n<br />#dessert #icecream #🍦 #waffles #omnomnom #burpple #fatdieme #tuesdate #vscocam #dessertprojectsg #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping
Next time it\'s my choice! Thick toast 🙋🏻
Thick buttery honey toast topped with whip, coconut ice cream, taro ice cream, gula melaka drizzle and desiccated coconut.
THIS WOULD BE IT!!! - with 3️⃣ SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM 😳🍞 #ThickToastAddict #FatDieMe \n<br />TASTE: 4.5/5 I think I\'ve found a replica of Bangkok\'s After You!! 😚 Their Nutella toast [$13.90] not only has Vanilla bean, but also Ferrero 🍦 - I can\'t emphasise more on how important 2 scoops are to prevent the 🍞 from being too dry (Dazzling Cafe please learn from this)! Added on a scoop of Earl Grey because I couldn\'t resist their variety of enticing flavours hehehe. 🏆 MY THICKTOAST RANKING SO FAR: DP &gt; Tuk Tuk Cha &gt; Dazzling Cafe

Literally.
• Hahahhaha.. Thanks @tldb_
Sorry, but u are not my piece of toast.
Having just the right amount of crispiness on the crust yet still fluffy on the inside. This is easily one of the better toast in SG, imo.
It is reverse affogato $5.5

With the #moscatoicecream , #nutellasauce &amp; #peanutcrunch it has a delightful taste &amp; texture even tho the waffle is not too crispy. Think if it is done with a buttery taste, it might be better...might be...just guessing. But is pretty nice already.
A no frill cup of #latter. As of a place which main focus is #icecream,didn\'t really expected anything really surprising. Decent with rooms for improvement.
Kind of reminding me of bacon ice cream.
Interesting flavours but what sold me was the ferrero rocher. #sgfoodies #sgfood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #hungrygowhere #burpple #whati8today #foodvsco #vscocam #eatoutsg #sgfoodunion #sgglutton #cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood #latergram #throwback #cafefoodsg #jamyundies #foodpicsg #foodphotography #icecream #ferrerorocher #dessertproject #bukithoswee #sgfoodtrend
Waffles are currently a work in progress, but they have a potential winner here #nofilter #wewantsugar
And I loved it! Savoury ice-cream is something new to me but this went very well for me! LOL! The sweetness from the Melon part of the ice-cream is very nicely complimented with the saltiness and texture of the parma ham bacon! An absolute delight to try! You gotta try this when you are here!
Currently only serving specially crafted ice-cream and I the placed called the #dessertproject Clean, industrial, bare &amp; minimalistic deco with 2 very cheerful &amp; friendly guys running the place. Other things such as Waffles, coffee &amp; drinks will be introduced as time goes by.
