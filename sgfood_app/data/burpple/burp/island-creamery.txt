Completing our CNY reunion lunch with some festive-flavoured ice-cream! The spicy Bak Kwa and Pineapple Tarts are festive specials.
Warm chocolate lava cake with Nutella ice cream on top. I can just gobble this up in 1 min
YUMMY
Chocolate is my good friend. Especially those with wafer/cookies/crispy chunks.
Nutella x Apple Pie ice-cream with @joshua_ng. Too icy for my liking! #latergram #icecream

Pulut Hitam, poached pear and black sesame Oreo üòçüòç
The Signature Mudpie ($5.80) is really something worth dying for üòç Three layers of ice cream which were Caramel, Cookies &amp; Cream, and Reverso (Dark Chocolate with Oreos), together with the Oreo crust, OMG literally speechless üò± If you love chocolate or Oreos, you need to get this immediately!! So worth the calories man!
I am not \"poke-moning\" infact I refuse to get into this craze. üîπ\n<br />Anyway, this ice cream joint is in my backyard... so close to home. Very local flavors. So I am chilling  with pulut hitam (black glutinous rice) &amp; banana ice cream. Whilst I liked the rice bits, the pulut hitam flavor did not come out strong. Whereas the other was sweet but it had a nice banana aftertone which I liked.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />This latest outlet is about 5 months old. Small space with chio floor tiles. It seems like my backyard is becoming more happening with new eateries sprouting out but hopefully it will still retain the olden day charm.
Nice place to chill, enjoy a nice book with your choice of delicious dessert. 
Hot and cold all at e same time
$5.80 totally worth it !! 
Ice cream and brownie can never go wrong. Never.

One of those must-do things at Island Creamery, Serene Center: Taking tons of photos and stick them on the walls!
I\'ve tried almost all the flavours Island Creamery has to offer and I can never feel sick of returning to this place.
