These juicy BBQ wings are one of my fav at CHOMP CHOMP! 😋👍🏻 In the background - satay beehoon and rojak. 😍 . \n<br />I guess no matter how the food scene in Singapore evolves, hawker food will always be part of our culture. 😌 Thats why places like chomp chomp is always full of people despite the heat, noise and sweat eh?😁👌🏻 (ps: blogged about some of the food that I like at #chompchomp #ontheblog 😊) #hawkerpedia
When craving strike, we will just head down to eat like today! One of the more famous hawker places in Singapore that foreigners might also make their way down. However the place is quite small so be sure to go down early or in small groups. We wolf down the Black Carrot Cake ($3) before the rest came so it\'s missing, but other food are just as tasty. Here are some of the items: Youtiao rojak ($3), Stingray ($12), Chicken wing ($1.30 each), Satay ($0.50 each stick), Hokkien Mee ($3) and Sugarcane drink ($1.50 per small cup)
Chicken wings//large cup of sugarcane//fried egg with oysters aka ou jian//sambal stingray//satay with peanut sauce//fried hokkien mee. Great place to catch up with friends or chilling or dating. The downside is that it could be difficult finding a seat, especially during the weekends!! But the food is really good, pity the picture I took doesn\'t do it justice.
😋 #TGIF
One of the best Hokkien Mee in the area as the thin beehoon and yellow noddles are moist with fresh prawns, squid and gravy. The waiting time can be an hour long so you might want to grab other local delights while waiting.
This mammoth of a cup can be found here at chomp chomp. With the amount of BBQ stuff that you\'re eating, you\'ll definitely need a thirst quencher and this would fit the bill 
Good ol\' hawker food at Chomp Chomp food centre: We had the usual sambal stingray, belacan kangkung, oyster omelette, BBQ chicken wings, and one jug of sugar cane juice. 
2 of my favourite stores in chomp chomp for my supper fix! The black carrot cakes come with prawn! But I still liked the one from bedok old bus interchange hawker for that smooth eggy finish for their carrot cakes.
Crispy and guaranteed delicious thai fried oyster only @ Soh Ho Thai Fried Oyster
Prices are $1.50 for a small cup, $2.50 for medium and $3 for a big cup. Coming here means you are usually in a big group, and that means you can\'t resist not ordering this large Sugarcane Juice ($3), which when compared to other stalls, has more flavour in it!
Despite another bbq store being the one with newspaper articles displayed, my friends and I feel that chompchomp serves the better sambal stingray. The stingray is fresh and slides off the bone, and the sambal is flavourful with a composite of tangy and spicy. Lovely! $10 for a small serving, enough for 2-3. 
happy weekend guys! \n<br />where do you reckon has the best chicken wings? 😋
I\'m not really the shell food kind of person. But decided to try this. And.... it was not bad. Will try this again! :)
&amp; I\'ve got my assurance from @avenuelove that she\'ll chomp wimme anytime if I wanna!!!🍗🍜🍛🌿😋 #jmeats
🐔 Bought the wings from Good Luck BBQ Chicken Wings, Stall 29.
It\'s being years since I ate a satay bee hoon... It\'s like... \"Wow... It\'s still taste the same\"Ms Q was commenting that the peanut sauce is so delicious.. 
As all locals do, we like to share constricted spaces, filled with smoke and flavours and get our hands down and dirty to experience the local delights. 
$12 for 3 pieces of sambal stingray.. I am so loving the serangoon/ hougang area!!!
Sometimes the best way to hang out with a group of friends is over good hearty sinful tze-char fare paired with gigantic mugs of sugar cane juice. Pocket friendly and ever so satisfying.
There were so many stalls, we weren\'t quite sure which are the better ones for which. Ordered from random stalls and we got lucky with this - the fried carrot cake is soft, moist and nicely mixed and mashed with the chilli, egg, flavours and all. Yumms.
A trip to Chomp Chomp wouldn\'t quite be complete without some grilled satays and chicken wings. Get your fingers greasy!
Sooo greasy and sooo sinful, but sooo good especially with that tangy chilli dip and chinchalok. Love those slightly charred extra crispy edges...
How I love my carbs 😍 noodles and beehoon in that fragrant prawn stock. What\'s not to love about SG hawker fare? You brave the heat, wait for 30-45mins for your favorite bowl of noodles. Mix that dollop of chili and sweat it all out! SHIOK. 
Black carrot cake and sambal stingray was very fresh and tasty! Definitely going back for this
Go there early. Be prepared to smell like BBQ. But definitely a place for all the BBQ food 
Their black carrot cake is a dish that\'s more than meets the eye. Looking just like any other carrot cake, a taste of it would reveal its depth of taste. It leaves a thick and sweet taste from the dark sauce used, lingering around your tongue with an beautiful aroma that can be described closest to coffee. Their carrot cake is also fried with prawns that impart more flavors to it and its a treat to find prawns buried in the carrot cake as you dig into it. Definitely a meal that would invoke your love for carrot cakes once again, bringing back memories of perfect Sunday mornings with carrot cakes for breakfast and cartoons for entertainments.
I would always order their stingray, satay and chicken wings!! All the food there are the \"must try\". 
After a week eating Western food, we always miss local Singapore cuisine :) | ★★★☆☆
Ok, before you start to curse &amp; swear because its 11.50pm now. This is the last 1! \n<br />Wu Xiang fritters (without Wu Xiang) like sotong balls, fish cake, Chinese sausage, water chestnut omelette and bee Hoon. Nice :D S$7
Oyster Egg S$5 - this is really nice! Eggs are fluffy &amp; juicy! I don\'t know how to appreciate oysters so I don\'t know if they tasted normal or weird😝
Close up! I thought their standard had dropped, not as nice as before.
Braving the supper crowd for some sting ray and SUGAR CAAAAANE! The glasses here are almost as big as our heads!
A MUST TO EAT BEFORE I FLY. Truly Singaporean food!!! Nomnomnom! 😋 *rubs belly* #foodporn
Late night supper: Ah Hock Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee
Popiah -- our local style of spring roll. This was one of the better ones I\'ve had - nice and tasty and big on the filling. Yum!
stingray(1st) and char kway teow(3rd) were not bad👌🏼but the carrot cake(last) wasnt v good:-( still prefer Newton hawker!
unfortunately, I’ve bitten more than I can chew as this is a tad too spicy and oily.!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#bbqseafood#bbq#chompchomp#friedrice#seafood#sambalfriedrice#sambal#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

\"Chomp chomp never fails.\"
🤔
How can they compete with the well-established Stall 36?
BBQ chicken wings.
Damn unorthodox but MAI JUDGE.
As I wasn\'t sure which Stall sells the best satay, I just ordered from the nearest stall. It took a very long time for the satay to arrive, around 30mins or more. I have already finished all the other foods that I have ordered before the satay arrive. In my opinion, the satay was perfectly marinated, it also has the char taste which I really love. However, there are a few burnt parts. Adding to that, the satay sauce was horrible, it totally ruined the satay as a whole. The sauce was very watery, and tasted quite bland. I would not go back for this again because I was very disappointed with the satay sauce.
One word to describe the nite: SHIOK

Wasn\'t that good.
I only like it white when the chef can make the eggs perfectly crispy while maintaining the soft texture of the radish. I know only one stall where the white carrot cake is perrrrrrrfecto and that\'s the only one I will definitely eat, if only the queue isn\'t always so long 😫 \n<br />P/S: the grease does not bother me at all! if this was any drier, the taste just wouldn\'t be as good. agree?\n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporefood #singaporeeats #hawkerfood @sgfoodie #hawkerpedia #carrotcake
the right strength of fire, the right amount of moisture and the right length of time are all important factors in cooking up a good plate of Hokkien Mee. personally, I think this plate has got the factors all smack down
serious. (if someone needs company to have this, ask me ✋🏼) some places charge exhorbitant prices for a piece of flat fish with hardly any meat on it and/or undercook the fish but definitely not this one! Sambal anything is always good cos Singaporeans love spicy food so much, don\'t we?? for those who aren\'t sure why that lime is there. well, it isn\'t just for show. it adds an extra zaaannnng to enhance the taste of the stingray (or at least in my opinion) @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporefood #singaporeeats #hawkerfood @sgfoodie #hawkerpedia
how I have missed you all, Satay! 🐓🐖🐄🐐 my favourite is actually lamb but not many people like that and most prefer to go with chicken and pork. I don\'t really care as long as the meat is good and comes with to-die-for peanut sauce! if I could, I would have one bowl of peanut sauce to each stick of satay 😋 \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporefood #singaporeeats #hawkerfood @sgfoodie #hawkerpedia #satay

Oh and can I just say that we got another plate of gong gong (not in photo) from macperson seafood stall because they were so nice even though we didn\'t patronize them at first (they still offered us a box of tissue and lime water to wash our hands plus they added some cockles because we told them the ones we had were not very fresh) Best service you can get at chomps. #definitelypatronizetheirstallagain #macpersonseafood #suppertime #shiok #foodporn #burpple

With only one loklok stall at Chomp Chomp Food Centre, it is not difficult to spot the stall. I decided to give it a go since the one I normally have is the soupy type. I would say its quite yummy, do not belittle them thinking it wouldn\'t fill your tummy. Favs so far will be the bacon w asparagus, cheese tofu and different types of mushrooms. Hydrate yourself w the ever refreshing sugarcane juice while having this is such a joy, especially due to the humid weather these days.
👍

This uncle has not stopped frying up plate after plate of fragrant and delicious Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles for the two hours we were there. He was just clanking away all the time in front of the heat. His dedication can be tasted in the plates of noodles he insist on frying one portion at a time despite the long wait list.
