It\'s really crispy!!! Gives that light crisp sound when u chew into it. And the egg adds to the fragrance! Comes with chopped prawns and veggies buried underneath. At one of my favourite supper joint and meesua isnt the only thing i eat now. ✌🏼\n<br />.\n<br />#chaotabeehoon #sengkeeblackchickenherbalsoup #beehoon
The team\'s favourite spot to hit up for supper after dinner service, especially since its the closest Zi Char place within Kembangan. \n<br />Their broth is amazing. Always served piping hot, extremely peppery with lots of porky flavour; comforting, satiating, warming you to your core. \n<br />4.5bucks/bowl\n<br />#FTrecommends #burpplesglatenight
$5. The black herbal broth packed a punch, but the other elements in the soup (yes including the Mee Sua) were just disappointing.
Not a usual fan of 白米粉 but this was hands-down the best dish and I\'ll definitely return for it. The gravy was really rich and I could really tell that they didn\'t scrimp on any prawn heads and clams to boil the broth. AND PORK LARDS. So good that I couldn\'t stop licking the remains.
I used to patronise this place for quite but have not visited this place for awhile as I moved to the west. Recently, as I was in the east I decided to pay this place a visit again but was deeply disappointed as the standard of the place has dropped drastically. The soup base isn\'t as thick and is kinda bland. Hmmmmm....
Decided to try the white mee sua today as craving for soupy base noodle and this caught my eye. Mee sua with prawns,mincemeat and dried scallops  in thick starchy soup base goes with vinegar and pepper.
Because the hubs hasn\'t been here before, and I don\'t mind more herbs. Do come early as it gets really busy around dinner time. #tingzieeats #burpple #tingzietimewithfolks
Considering SengKee\'s proximity to Kembangan MRT &amp; my house, it\'s definitely a place I visit often to appease my late night hunger pangs (it\'s open till 3/4am). Had the Har Cheong Kai ($12) for 7 pieces. I\'d say it was pretty good, deeply battered to a nice rusty brown, better than average but not the best I\'ve had, plus I found it a little expensive too. Had their signature Herbal Mee Sua ($5) with a mix of ingredients, the herbal taste was pretty strong but tbh I don\'t understand the craze over it, maybe because I\'m not a big fan of herbal soup. &amp; lastly the Salted Fish Fried Rice ($6) which was REALLY salty &amp; hard to palate. Ended up scraping off the salted fish crisps off the top and ate the fried rice as it is. I feel that Seng Kee\'s actually a little overrated haha I\'ve had much better zichar fare with price tags that are much easier on the pocket! It\'s good location is definitely a plus point though, it\'s only a 3 minute walk from the MRT!
Long-standing tze char (煮炒) shop tucked away in a cosy corner of Kembangan. Apparently famous for their black chicken herbal soup which i\'ve not tried as it\'s forever sold out 😖 &amp; to think i\'ve been visiting for over 5 years! Another strong contender is their herbal soup pork mee sua.
With a flavorful broth, generous servings of 料 and perfectly cooked mee sua, this is one bowl ($5) of heartwarming goodness that fills you right up! Plus it probably makes for some pretty good drunk food!!
The top layer of this bee hoon is crispy and gives people the feel that it\'s burnt (Chao ta in hokkien). It goes absolutely well with the sambal chilli! It\'s one unique dish and kinda resembles the famous jb san lou bee hoon.
Yes, come for the tummy-warming black chicken herbal Kidney Mee Sua ($5), but stay for the unexpectedly fabulous Har Cheong Gai ($12). \n<br />Photo by Burppler Peichin Lelz
Thick and starchy, the \"White Mee Sua\" (白面线) had a few prawns, scallops and some minced pork which gave it a subtle sweetness. It tasted good with a splash of black vinegar too. I felt the portion was decent for the price of $6. \n<br />In the background of my photo is a dish of vegetables that has a grand-sounding name with \"Cameron Highlands\" in it. I didn\'t think it was worth $12. Mainly because fifty percent of the dish was actually beansprouts 😑 
$58 fish head medium size.  Call to ask if they have it.
White bee Hoon is soooo good! With clams and plenty of pork lards!!!! #blueblackwhiteeats
They are famous for their black mee sua soup, but this white version that comes with pacific clams, prawns and minced pork is delish too. The texture is gooey like shark fin\'s soup, and I guess that\'s how it should be like because you are supposed to add vinegar to it? #howtonotbefat #burpple
an instant wake-me-up, yet comforting at the same time. gotta try it! other items on the menu - johor fried noodles, white meesua are also must-trys 😁
$6 for a bowl of this goodness! 😱😱 There\'s also zi char options as well if you\'re someone who dislike Mee Sua! One recommendation would be the salted egg chicken ! The deep fried chicken retained its crispness despite the sauce and its pretty addictive ! Since the opening hours is till 4am, people searching for cheap supper can keep this  in mind
missus and i concluded this is a lite version of a good kambing soup. kidney pieces tasted clean and cooked well but gosh were they tad stingy with it.
we from da far west made a far east movement all the way to kembangan to try this famous supper place. concluded that this is a lite version of a very good kambing soup. the kidney pieces tasted clean and cooked well but gosh were they tad stingy with it.
Always come here for their Mee Sua! It\'s so good and the soup is so addictive I can finish 2 bowls in one sitting. First time trying their har jeong kai and it was delicious! Crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside 😍
Sudden crave for something warm. \n<br />And it\'s kidney soup mee sua. Been ages since I ate this and my first time here despite staying so close.\n<br />I would definetly come back for more! \n<br />Oh yeah, remember to order the prawn paste fried fritters. It\'s damn good, just a lil oily.
But actually I do. I\'m in the mood for comfort food like that. 언니&amp;형부 고마워~ #burpple
Spicy but delicious curry fish head. Fish head was fresh and gravy goes very well with plain rice. Portion is quite large and suitable for 3 pax
Delicious famous Kidney mee sua 2min walk from kembangan mrt. Broth have good depth. Other must try items include the lala bee hoon and also jb fried Bee hoon. For in depth review check out:\n<br />http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2016/03/food-review-seng-kee-black-chicken.html
The mee sua is silky smooth in a rich slightly peppery herbal broth, topped with a generous amount of kidneys, liver and lean meats. They also do have pretty good zi char dishes to go along with the mee sua. My kind of comfort food!
Years back, after teaching at Changkat Changi Secondary, I would walk past the place to take the long journey back home. Fast forward to 2016, I finally had the chance to try their famous Mee Sua. The thick thick herbal chicken broth is already a winner, and throwing in generous amount of pork slices, liver and kidney, this bowl is truly a winner. Although famous, Seng Kee did not short change you. Every drop is simply slurp-worthy, unami and hearty! So good for a cold nights, or simply because you crave for something lush wholesome. I am coming back to try their Zichar menu, and their mee goreng (since almost everyone had a plate of that!) 
When it\'s late and you\'re in the east, and you don\'t wanna smell like block 85, here\'s an alternative. Think pork organ soup kway chap style mee sua! #lifechanging
Most known for their soups, Seng Kee makes the meanest herbal liver and kidney mee suas. The soups are fragrant, rich, perfect to slurp up with some noodles. And what\'s better is they do pretty good zi char dishes, so you can be sure to have delish sides with your steaming hot noodles!
The first time I tried this local favourite at Seng Kee, I was utterly besotted. Ohsocrispy skin, flavourful and not at all oily, tearing into juicy and surprisingly lean meat. Lotsa places dish out prawn paste chicken that though delicious, can be really salty. Seng Kee\'s weren\'t all that salty, managing to nail all the flavours while not leaving me with the need to chug down buckets of water. I\'ll have these over any café-esque wings anytime.
Super savoury mix of chye poh (pickled radish), minced pork, salted vegetable and dried chillies curtaining this block of soft beancurd. Immensely delicious! I\'d order this every. single. time. \n<br />Great place for supper, especially for those of you after you\'re done cubbing/pub hopping; nothing like hot tasty food in the middle of the night!
\nA bowl of sliced pork meesua with extra peppery broth. They probably coated the pork slices in flour prior to cooking which resulted in a slight gelatinous film all around, but was super tender nevertheless! The peppery broth is naturally thickened by the starch from the meesua which gave it a fuller mouthfeel. \n<br />Great place for supper, especially for those of you after you\'re done cubbing/pub hopping; nothing like hot soup in the middle of the night!
The famous herbal mee sua from the east!
However, the meat was over. cooked and soup was rather bland. I still prefer their fried version.
Late night foodie heaven. However, most of the herb chicken soup was sold out and we were leave with the \"not so nice\" ones\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Their fried Mee Sua was more than lovely. Hint of fried lard with savory Mee Sua. Good skill from the chef as the Mee Sua didn\'t broke off into parts\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Seng Kee Black Herbal Chicken Soup\n<br />467 Changi Road\n<br />Open daily from 1700H to 0400H
Whole plate of goodness steamed to perfection. $35 for whole fish. 
If you wanna have supper but comfort food style! This is one for you! The soup is soooo good and thick with flavors. $5 per bowl!
Mee sua with herbal soup base and pork! Pork liver, pork intestines... you name it. The soup is 👍!!! Paid $7 for a bowl after adding extra pork intestines.. couldn\'t really tell if there was extra tho. Also ordered kopi pork ribs at $12 which was average I guess. This place opens till late which is awesome, but there are only parallel car park lots.. which I absolutely abhor. 😥
Steamy, dreamy bowl of rich, herbal goodness. Served piping hot for the pig organs continue cooking, this bowl captures everything a Singaporean looks for in great food. Who\'s with me?!
Love the sweet and sour taste in this pot of goodness especially for ladies! 
My favourite go-to place for Mee Sua and especially in the middle of the night haha! They open till late. Their herbal tea is also yums :)
A tad overpriced and overrated IMO.
This is another popular restaurant with really good Mee Sua and zi char dishes.

Famous Mee Sua session with the guys. Famous for its kidney mee sua but I don\'t eat kidney so I had pork+liver mee sua. Steamed fish is very fresh and good!!!! Mee sua soup is very shiok too!! Must eat must eat!
The best comfort bowl of black herbal chicken soup for supper - full of flavour and tasty
If you\'ve skipped dinner (gasp!) during a long workday, come into the loving embrace of Seng Kee. Their awesome Mee Sua, with its soupy herbal infusion, will bring you back to Ah Ma\'s kitchen. You can choose from several variations- lean pork slices, kidneys, beancurd, and even fried meesua with crab. It\'s not Ah Ma, but Ah Ma\'s probably sleeping at 3am (best not to wake her).
Lightly crisp, lovely juicy meat with fat chunk of prawn. Accompany with sweet sauce to enhance the taste. Yummy!
If u like it tender, remember to tell the staff to undercooked else will be tough. Soup not too salty.
Besides their 招牌腰子面线 is good no dirty dirty smell as it was cleanly handled... safe to eat..haha.  they also have the Lemon LaLa which is so good.
Yo Ji Mee Sua 腰只面線 $4.50 Great peppery soup! #sgfood #food
Only by shirking one\'s \"good guy\" persona and blatantly being oneself will one realise-- that only in truth is one a leader in showing others the way to good things. #cyexl2018 #cyexl #reflections #revelations #walkingreflections ***\n<br />In the past, no matter how I craved for my favorite foods, I would shy away from fulfilling these cravings, in a bid to consider those with me whom I knew hated those foods. Presently, as I have cast that consideration away and freely become a \"bad guy\" by choosing to eat wherever I want, it has ended up achieving the opposite effect of what I used to fear-- those with me finding food they enjoy in places they would never have looked into previously. Evidently, my former ways of managing relationships and things... were such folly. #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #igsg #sengkee #meesua #foodstagram #foodiegram #burpple #leica #huaweip9plus #throwback ***\n<br />當你以為委曲求全是在寬容身邊的人，其實你終究在傷害他們。只有拋開自己的\"好人\"面具，放肆地做自己，反而才能發現-- 你其實是帶領他人發現美好事物的佼佼者。#日常写真 ***\n<br />以前，即使我再怎麼想吃自己喜歡的食物，我總是怯步，因為知道身邊的人相反地很討厭那些食物。現在我不管了，爽快做個\"壞人\"決定自己想吃的，反而讓他們在意想不到的地方也找到他們心意的食物。如此可見，我以前處事態人的方式... 好傻。#新加坡 #新加坡美食 #面线 #攝影 #丢回
Finally had RUNDATE at the 100PLUS track with girlfriend! After we ran, we need to feed our hungry tummies! 😩 as many cravings as we have, we decide to have our comfort food. MEESUA! First visit in 2018, many more to come 😝 it is so good how can you not return ?! Generous amount of lean pork, kidneys and livers (I don’t eat livers but my girlfriend does and well she doesn’t take kidneys but I do) 🤣 We always order our meesua as meesua half cooked because we don’t like to have mushy meesua and 8/10 times we get our orders just right. Dip the meat in chili padi and light soya sauce, heavenly! 😍 #meesua #singaporesupperplaces #burpplesg #burpple #burpplefood #supperintheeast #sengkeemeesua #herbalmeesua #comfortfood #pigorganmeesua #singaporestyle #feedmefood2018
Omg I\'m so sick of this new year new me thing hahahaha! Happy New year guys!
However it was their Chao Ta Bee Hoon that caught my attention and affection. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />Really Crispy Mee Sua both on the surface and edges with slices of fish cakes, bits of mini prawns, bean sprouts and the critical ingredient - fried egg. I prefer JB Ah Meng’s version as there more ingredients, flavour and oomph. But if you prefer crispy, burnt ends Style Mee Sua this will be your place. Have it with their chilli, a drizzle of lime and you’re good to go (eat it ASAP when it arrives for the maximum crunch) 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #sengkee #herbalsoup #meesua #chaotabeehoon #fried #beehoon #sengkeemeesua

The mee sua is smooth and silky to the mouth but the liver is overcooked and i would prefer the slices of liver and kidney be larger. 8/10 -------------------------------------------\n<br />Stir fry with 4 different kind of vegetables (四大天王): i would not suggest to order this dish cause the long bean is slightly undercooked and there isn\'t any wok hei, it just taste like ikan bilis with vegetables. 👎\n<br />-------------------------------------------\n<br />#instafood #insta_food #food #sgfood #sgfoods #foods #yummy #hungry #foodism #foodgram #foodgasm #foodfie #foodspam #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodstagram #foodspotting #sgfoodspotting #foodshare #sgfoodshare #foodpics \n<br />#sgfoodpics #foodie #foodlover #8dayseat #burpple #dinner #chinesefood

Mixed with slices of pork, liver and kidneys. Meesua so smooth so silky. The soup so rich, thick and somewhat creamy and had a velvety aftertone. The herbyness exudes out wonderfully and left a exhilarating finish. I seldom eat kidneys. These were tender, had no smell and just melts in your mouth.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />A heavy sprinkling of scallions. A bowl that was bestowed with generous portions of meat, kidneys and liver. As I dig deeper, there were bits and pieces submerged. Every slurp felt so invigorating. It is herbal after all. Just nice for a rainy day. Slurpingly and comfortingly good.
This yusheng portion is really big! We came as 10 adults and 2 kids, but it was a tad too much as a first dish of the CNY package. It can safely feed 15 pax or more!

Price: $5\n<br />•\n<br />🚇:Kembangan •\n<br />After a failed attempt to conquer Geylang Serai bazaar, we were too hungry as such we decided to find out another place to eat. Seng Kee was open till late night and it is just less than 5 mins walk from the Kembangan station. Seng Kee is famous for their herbal Mee Sua which was highly recommended by one of my kakis. •\n<br />For me, I am not an innards person so I decided to order the chicken herbal Mee Sua.The mee Sua was indeed silky smooth and it will definitely pair well with the herbal soup. But the broth was too mild and I could hardly taste any herbal taste. \n<br />I was just too hungry, so I decided to order the prawn paste chicken too. It was disappointing. It was too salty and there was not even any hint of flavour.\n<br />•\n<br />I did a search on Seng Kee again and realise there is another outlet. Maybe I should head there to try? •\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #sg #sgfood #herbal #chicken #meesua #supper
