Chocolate mousse, chocolate brownie and chocolate pudding, with ben and Jerry\'s chocolate ice-cream! This is heaven! Its a very rich, yummy and happy dessert!
Topped with tobiko, served with green tea soba noodle, vegetables band mushrooms. Its a fusion dish that\'s quite unique and tasty. 
The chicken skin is crispy and the meat is tender. It comes with mashed potato and homemade gravy. 
Had this some time way back before I joined Burrple and yes it etched a lasting memory on me! I only remembered it was cheese overload and the steak fries were thick enough to justify the generous amount of cheese Spuds &amp; Aprons weren\'t stingy on. There were three types of cheese (can\'t remember what they were) but boy were they finger licking good as starters! 
Happiness in a Jar. Too hard to get a photo of this dessert, but it\'s basically filled with fresh berries, salted caramel, shortbread crumble, and Ben &amp; Jerry\'s vanilla ice cream. So delish when you get every component in one dip of the spoon. #icecream #fruit #berries #sugarhigh #happyfood #dessert #sweet #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Wagyu Beef Steak. This is an off-the-menu special that the chefs decided to whip up specially for our tasting - loved the addition of rock salt on the side. #wagyu #beef #steak #salt #meat #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Crispy Pork Belly. Slow-cooked pork belly with pickled pineapple and mustard - perhaps we\'d left the meat out a bit too long, but I thought it was rather dry and tough. The crackling was spectacular, though. #pork #porkbelly #meat #crackling #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Tobiko Crusted Cod Fillet. Oven roasted Atlantic cod topped with flying fish roe mayo and served with soba and enoki in ponzu sauce. #cod #fish #tobiko #soba #japaneseinspired #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Braised 5 Spiced Oxtail. Another fusion dish of wagyu oxtail stew with Asian five spice. Braised for three hours, the meat falls off the bone with just the slightest push of the fork. #oxtail #stew #meat #asian #fusionfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Wicked Fries &amp; Gravy. A crowd-pleaser of steak fries smothered in brown sauce (made with the jus of roast chicken) and the perfect blend of 6 cheeses - mozzarella, parmesan, gruyere, emmental, cheddar and provolone. #fries #cheese #cheesy #gravy #comfortfood #sgfood #yum #foodporn #gooey #ilovemyjob
Chilli Crab in a Tux. A Singaporean-Western fusion of chilli crab heaped in indented potato halves - loved the spice and the crispy potato skins! #chillicrab #fusionfood #appetiser #potato #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Good view but poor service. Crew was not attentive although it wasn\'t full house for dinner. They didn\'t bother to clear the empty starter plates upon serving main course. Failed to replace the serving plates when there were ants on it.
Great View and great company. If only the food is less pricy üò≠#eatoutsg #burpple #burpplesg #mtfaber #wings #fries #pasta
This pushed past usual formalities sans the mash nor the light salad and is instead presented with Asian rice. The similarities to the run-off-the-mill Western food stall, chicken cutlet rice offerings are uncanny and a tad humorous at this point. That being said. the confit on its own is excellent, moist flesh and sturdy crust intact
Definitely a must have when visiting Spuds &amp; Aprons on Faber Peak
and I\'ve got {Banana frozen parfait} on my mind... served alongside toasted marshmallows and caramelized biscuit crumbs, I can lay the notions of my diet to rest
A light and relatively clean {Tobiko Crusted Cod Fish Pasta} to put things in place before the debauchery that\'s about to unfold over the manic F1 weekend

Try Spuds and Aprons, located at the peak of Mt Faber! Reviews up on fatassbean.wordpress.com!
Super sweet! üòä
This dish is yummy! The gravy is addictive. 
Personally I feel it a bit lacklustre, spoilt the natural flavour of the crab &amp; too dry for my liking.
Gorgeous desserts made in-house at #SpudsNAprons üç¶
Chempedak Bread &amp; Butter Pudding. The pungent jackfruit-like fruit is incorporated into this pudding - a cross between brioche and croissant dough. #breadandbutter #pudding #icecream #dessert #sweet #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
