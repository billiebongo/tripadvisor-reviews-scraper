Usual Friday supper place - pork ribeye steak with cream broccoli and corn kernel 12.90 NETT
Especially shiok after a workout, medium grilled. Softness equally throughout the steak. Steak plus 2 sides for $20. 90 NETT.
Generous amount of seafood, however pasta lacking flavour :(
\"How well done do you want your salmon?\" Huh? You mean we get to choose the doneness of our salmon? That\'s something new. Not too rare, not too dry we opted for medium and boy was it good! Juicy, moist well seasoned salmon with a crispy skin, this has to be one of best salmon we\'ve ever eaten. Mind you the sides are average at best but with a main like that who cares? :P
The steak and olive rice were good. Don\'t order the macaroni and cheese. 
Finally found my long-lost favourite western place in serangoon gardens! They have moved to myvillage level 2!
Tenderly grilled chicken covered in a complimenting brown gravy with plenty of mushrooms for a bite. Mac &amp; Cheese was thick and cheesy, while the baked potato is soft, fluffy and came with a huge slab of butter to taste; all it needs would be a sprinkle of bacon bits for te extra savoury touch.
Crispy onion rings and macaroni covered in thick cheese sauce accompanies the tenderly grilled chicken smothered in a flavourful and thick barbeque sauce.
Pan-fried fish that was crusty outside and flaky inside, topped with a Lemon Dill sauce which was rather light but refreshing. Mac &amp; Cheese was thick and cheesy, but the light flavoured cream and broccoli felt mismatched in flavour despite well-executed.
Pork Ribeye Steak
Curry Chicken for dinner
🐮\n<br />Took the opportunity to do a horn to horn comparison, between the 🌱 grassfed &amp; 🌾 grainfed ribeyes, and we had a split decisions.\n<br />🐮\n<br />Some of us found the 🌾 grainfed to be more holistic, while i enjoyed the 🌱 grassfed better - cos the lean &amp; fatty portions were little more distinct.\n<br />🐑\n<br />The lamb shoulder was pretty good too, but would require good hands, to access the meats at the bone.
They have other sides that you can chose from too if onion rings or mac &amp; cheese isn\'t your kind. The chicken was really tender and had strong honey ginger flavour. The sauce was more sweet than savoury. Onion rings was okay - it was fried to crisp! Their mac &amp; cheese was bad though, it was undercooked!\n<br />⚊\n<br />✏#JaeplusKaeReviews\n<br />▪\n<br />💻 JaeplusKae.wordpress.com\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />#igsg #sg #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodporn #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodgram #food #foodie #instafood #feedfeed #먹스타그램 #먹방 #yum #delicious #chicken #cheese #dinner #visualsoflife

Always come here for steak/lamb first pricing is good. Average two pax about $60. The grill is left a fragrance taste on the steak itself, marinated w salt,pepper abit if garlic mix. It taste good. Ambience is fine, air condition, food quality is consider good.
Affordable yet delicious. This is the place to go! ☝️😍\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #singaporefood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instagramfood #instafood #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #sgrestaurants #instafood_sg #foodgasm #bestfood_aroundtheworld\n<br /> #nomnomsg #eeeeeats #isteak #steak #ribeye #westernfood

Just $8! Cheap and Good!
Cheap and good steaks!
Situated at myVillage, many people visited there for western food as it is more affordable as compared to other western restaurants. Was having cravings for western food but to my dismay I had a Horrendous food and service experience :(They missed my order even though it was not lunch hour. Aglio olio tasted weird as they added some herbs that we\'re not even suitable for it! Humph IMO, not worth the value and I would prefer going to Old Airport Road for cheaper and bigger quantity!
Lovin it 💕
Lovin the mac&amp;cheese💕
Worth a try 👍
Was it meant to be dry?😟
Highly recommended if you\'re around Serangoon Gardens area! ت
Got to say Sirloins are quite tender and nice too(:
Been awhile since I had Steaks:P
Grilled Chicken Chop =)
Amazing quality for hawker steak. I\'ve heard that they\'re not very consistent though.
