Fluffy Earl Grey Pancakes drizzled with a smooth Nutella sauce, Macadamia crumble and a lightly poached pear to top off the sweet stack. \n<br />#punch_sg
Mildly spiced and very lightly sweetened. Perhaps it\'s one for people who don\'t like their drinks too sweet, and I personally wished that the spice was stronger.

Love this poached egg with avocado on toasted sourdough.  Simply yummy.
üòõ\n<br />Thank you for always bringing me to places that I want to go üòò
For someone who likes his pancakes with butter and maple syrup only, these pancakes certainly did not disappoint. Paired with an espresso tonic, because the past few days have been crazily hot. #burpple #punchsg
The smashed avocado with poached eggs was simply smashing.  The addition of fried mushroom simply made this a filling lunch. Highly recommended.

Decadent chocolate brownie-cookie with a thick schmear of salted caramel Buttercream in between. Sure packs a Punch ü§ì
Simple but well executed (toast, avocado, poached eggs), though at the price you pay which is about $13(?) making this at home can save your wallet....!!!
A bit on the dry side, but great pancakes nonetheless. Love the crumble and pear was well poached -- it\'s a funny combination but I guess it works! Aesthetically pleasing as well.
You can mix and match from a list of items to form your preferred breakfast plate. TH got poached eggs, mushrooms and toast, and he was really satisfied with everything. It may have been nothing fancy, but each was executed with care. 
This is one elegant Reuben that\'s tastefully done in every sense of the word.\n<br />The ratio of meat to sauerkraut to gruyere and to bread, is spot-on in my opinion. I especially love how thick the slices of corned beef are; and in contrast, how thin, the toasted rye.\n<br />The portion is exactly right - well, for your truly anyway. It left me feeling full but thinking of when I can return for my next one.
Dived into the weekend with brunch at Punch (hey, it rhymes! üòÑ) We shared this pretty plate of fresh fruit with honey-infused Greek yogurt before hitting the heavier stuff.
Ahh, I can\'t stress enough how much I love this. The cheese is just the right amount of mature, the toasted white bread and the soup... chunky, smoky and bacon-y. If only the soup serving was double (I have suggested this on more than one occasion) because I need moarrrr.
The pancakes with on the denser side with subtle hints of Earl Grey which could be stronger. Though, lovely poached pear with the right amount sweetness with that beautiful coating of Nutella-esque sauce.
Didn\'t have the pricing of this item as I have finally experience the \"no-menu\" service at @punch.gram - you\'ll vaguely remember a few items while you look around for inspiration what others are ordering üòπ
Bouncy oversized Tiger Prawns and seared Scallops (not complaining!) on my Garlic and Chilli Aglio Olio, they\'ve also incorporated an extra touch of savoriness with a dash of soy sauce. My lunch companions also enjoyed the crusty Reuben Sandwich (featured in the background; 14bucks) very much. \n<br />Punch is definitely fast reigning as one of my favourite frequents in town.
Does not look like the usual aglio olio. This prawn n scallop pasta had a deeper color as compared to normal aglio olio. Cooked aldente and tossed in loads of garlic and chilli padi. Tiger prawns were a little small and a tad over. What was most important was the pasta itself. Seasoning spot on. There was a certain umaminess finish. However a bit more chilli padi woukd have been welcoming to give it that extra kick.
I\'m a simple man. Gimme some carbs! üòù @punch.gram is an extremely clean and simplistic space, clearly a great place to see and be seen. üòú
I could not taste earl grey in the pan cake :(but the chill vibe and the ambience here will bring me back to give chance for other food :)
Banana oat porridge - a bowl of warm oats served with torched bananas. My idea of a comforting weekend breakfast. Somehow, I thought it can be made better with some strawberries. Maybe I\'m just being greedy. Heh.
This poke bowl was citrusy, tangy, light, with a good amount of heat and spice. Generous chunks of tuna was given, and were not too heavily marinated which allowed for the freshness and sweetness of the fish to come through. Although usually I prefer creamier sauces (like wasabi mayo) for my poke bowls, this  tangier version was (both literally and figuratively) a refreshing change. 
Well, it\'s supposed to be earl grey pancakes with poached pear. I couldn\'t taste the earl grey and the pancakes weren\'t the fluffiest. I guess the chill vibes and the company made up for it. 
Poached pears were ok, pancakes were fluffy and well done, but what pushed it from just good to fantastic was the amazing Kuromitsu syrup that came with the pancakes, instead of the usual maple/honey. Earthy with a slight tinge of bitterness, the mellow syrup, sweet as it was, really lifted the whole dish and made it all the more special. 
PUNCH is known for its drip coffee mm I got myself a flat white and it waz awezome!!!! the poached pear earl grey pancakes were a delight with the slightest hint of earl grey!!! the sweetness of the chocolate is slightly overpowering but perfect for anyone w a sweet tooth. salmon eggs ben were pretty good but we thought the mushroom toast could do with abit more seasoning 
I love every single element here: the distinct early grey flavour, the partially-chocolate-dipped poached pear, contrastingly sweet white chocolate \'crunchies\' macadamia. But I guess they need something to blend these elements together, because currently the dish can be rather dry and discordant, especially if savoured alone. Yes, the brown sugar syrup is pretty nice but its meagre amount doesn\'t significantly help.
Earl Grey Pancakes was a real sweet (sinful) treat for brunch! Loved the hint of earl grey in the moist pancakes + macadamia crumbles. Poached pear dipped in choco a great touch, but could\'ve been more flavorful. Sightly pricey ($19) but I believe loads of work went into this smallish, beautiful mess. Go for their perfectly ripe avo smash + poached eggs on sourdough ($13) if you want something more filling/savory! 
Love the distinct earl grey taste in the pancakes that makes it much more appetising than just plain batter. The crunchy white chocolate macadamia crumble makes up for the slightly flat pancakes, and the brown sugar syrup was so addictive, an exceptional alternative to maple syrup or honey. The poached pear didn\'t really add any value in my opinion... Would\'ve preferred something a bit more tart to balance the sweetness that was tipping the scales. It was quite challenging to finish this alone, perhaps two slices would\'ve been enough for me.
From the good folks of Ronin, PUNCH has gained itself a reputation for their gorgeous courtyard and excellent coffee. Their filtered Batch Brew ($4.50) is brewed using a blend of Ethiopian beans, and is the perfect java fix to start the day with. Located just across from Hong Lim Park, swing by in the mornings and perch yourself on one of their wooden benches among the courtyard greenery. If you can spare more time, enjoy a simple breakfast of Poached Eggs With Smashed Avocado on Sourdough ($13).
Can\'t resist anything Earl Grey, and I knew I had to come down to try this dish after seeing some posts circulating on Instagram about their new menu. Thought that the pancake was a little flat (could have been a little fluffier for a better texture) and the batter was a wee bit gritty inside; perhaps the batter needed a little more whisking before ending up on the pan. That being said, I must say that the pancakes indeed carried a nice hint of Earl Grey aroma upon the first bite which would satiate any Earl Grey fan out there. Coupled with White Chocolate Macadamia crumbles, it carried quite a good amount of sweetness amongst the nutty flavour, and around some spots, tasted real familiar to the crumbles from Post cereals (another favourite thing of mine). Poached pear was juicy and soft, releasing its natural sweetness on the pancakes as you cut a morsel apart, while the bottom comes coated in hardened dark chocolate. While having its own hits and misses, a pretty decadent breakfast dish that seems pretty apt even for dessert, though I do hope that they would refine the batter for an even more indulgent experience. Also spied that they have a Poke Bowl and a Braised Pork Bowl on the revamped lunch menu; guess I would be back pretty soon again!
It\'s good to share with her. A lovely date with her after a nonsense quarrel with her. 
Or maybe 5 cups. üò´\n<br />Punch is a bright and lively cafe started by some of the good folks that used to be at Ronin. Explains why they don\'t have a menu and prefer to recite the it instead. The spoken menu was one of my pet peeves about Ronin. There\'s good and bad points to this:\n<br />Good‚Äî(as they explained) they\'re trying to interact more with their customers. üëç\n<br />Bad‚Äîcustomers like me with short attention spans will forget the first few items of the menu by the time they\'re saying out the last item. üôÉ\n<br />Their brunch menu is very limited though. I enjoyed the friendly chatter with the people running the place, although the noise level makes it a little hard to have proper conversations.\n<br />Looking forward to visiting again for their dinner dishes which made us drool just reading the menu (which is printed).\n<br />#PunchCafe #Coffee *
Brunch menu that day consisted of:\n<br />- sourdough with mushrooms, avocado or‚Ä¶ (forgets);\n<br />- Aussie oats porridge with bananas; or\n<br />- mini doughnuts.\n<br />It\'d be really nice if the eggs could be prepared to our liking as I\'m not the biggest fan of poached eggs so that basically ruled out 3/5 of the menu immediately for me. Which means that this obviously was not my meal‚Ä¶ but had to post it cos look at that yolk. üòç\n<br />Heard some good reviews for the doughnuts, so guess we\'ll be back to try that soon. \n<br />#PunchCafe #Brunch
One of those simple breakfast staples that warms the heart. Comes with a side of milk to adjust the temperature and consistency of the oats to your liking. Although the brunch menu at Punch is limited, I certainly enjoyed this bowl of oats and sweet bananas‚Ä¶ reminds me of home in Oz.\n<br />#PunchCafe *
Lovely interior, lovely outdoor area and coffee as it should be, being the youngest of a good coffee chain. It\'s got a way to go in terms of her food and I prefer the raw and edgy older sister to this. #burpplesg #burpple #sgcafe
Opened by the folks behind The Plain and Ronin. Coffee is excellent as expected and brunch fare while standard is of decent quality. The ambiance is bright and airy, with a cool outdoor terrace and a wall garden. 
Happy Easter holiday!!!\n<br />On the side note, oh my tian, this place is so pretty!!!! Defintely a must visit place for me from now onward if I am in the CBD area.
Caramelized banana with the bottom filled with oats. Cold milk on the side to help lower the temperature. üíÅüèº
Too little nutella. And a non-fragrant donut. Also very heaty. Fun to look at and pop in your mouth but really nothing special
Beautiful layers. \n<br />At first, I was quite disappointed by its skin as it was not crispy. When I turned over the fillet, I understood why this happened. My guess was that the chef dried the filet and pan fried on the skin first. After he flipped over, and let the fish cooked flesh side down. This resulted the moist to soften the skin. Good effort to maintain the whole fillet and mango salsa went well with it. For $26 a fillet, I might not want to try this dish again.
Came to Punch for 2 reasons - wanted to try the Nutella Donut and to check out a new cafe near the office. 
Tried all the flavours, Jam, Nutella and Custard [$1.20 each, $10 for 10]. I thought the Custard\'s taste isn\'t as strong. Favourite is still Nutella. üòã
Light lunch situation some weeks ago with the #cbdlunchkakis. Frittata was meh, but I couldn\'t get enough of that well-seasoned smashed avocado.
These, look deceptively big on social media. They\'re actually barely bigger than a ringlet formed with my thumb and index joined at the tips. Tried the nutella and jam ones, which didn\'t taste too bad, but weren\'t extraordinary either. Texture was good, fillings were meh. I\'d rather have the HDB bakeries\' sugar doughnuts.
People who\'ve asked often enough know that one of my all-time fave spots is this. Well not exactly here as in PUNCH, but in any among their group of establishment\'s actually. When I first walked into PUNCH, owner Vincent greeted me with an enthusiastic \"I saw you at Ronin last week!\", before proceeding to ask me what I was up to these days. Then he patiently went on with explaining their coffee, allowing me to take as many photos as I want. It\'s always the same at Ronin too, with the staff knowing that I always go for a long black (or a matcha latte on the occasional visit). So till now, though my to-brunch list is increasingly growing, I\'ve always returned here when a touch of warmth and some familiarity is much needed. #FindComforHere
Smashed avocado on toast with poached eggs | S$13, value-for-money?üòê
Grilled seabass w mango salsa &amp; herb salad. Nice crisp on the skin, paired well with sweetness &amp; acidity of the mango salsa. Basil in salad saved that otherwise ordinary textures.
Very ordinary brownie with expresso butter which took the textures of a cookie instead. Mocha deserves a shoutout.
.\n<br />A glass of cold slushie would be awesome to chase away the heat. But if the drink is the size of my breakfast kaya spread bottle, then I would probably need 5 glasses to quench my thirst.
No menu, no description, no price; sneaky. \n<br />5 pieces of chicken served in a unique blend of spices which bear some resemblance to fried chicken sold by macik downstairs.\n<br />.\n<br />While deco of the place is no doubt attractive, attention should be shared with the food offerings and overall dining experience. The ventilation is simply hmmmm...
Luscious salted caramel buttercream sandwiched between crispy-chewy chocolatey discs ‚Äì these, the very legit lovechilds (or lovechildren?) of a brownie and a cookie. Absolutely loved the flavours mingling in this, though I think a bit more of that delectable salted caramel cream would make for a much better filling:cookie ratio.
From the folks behind The Plain and Ronin comes Punch, a new cafe opposite Hong Lim Park. It oozes laidback, Zen vibes with its simple, clean lines, grey tones and an alfresco backyard with a lush garden wall. As expected, the coffee is excellent, especially the filtered and batch brewed coffee from their brew bar. Don\'t be alarmed by the absence of a menu. Until they finalise their food choices, the waitstaff will come by your table to tell you about the day\'s offerings. Hopefully, their made-to-order Jam, Nutella and Custard Doughnuts ($1.20 each) are available when you swing by in the morning ‚Äî they\'re great with a cup of Batch Brew ($4.50) made with a blend of Ethiopian coffee beans. These folks have always understood what it means to serve simple, hearty breakfasts, making the Poached Eggs with Smashed Avocado ($13) on sourdough a satisying, foolproof option. For lunch (noon onwards), the Tuna Quinoa Salad ($15) is a healthy mix of greens that won\'t give you a food coma back in the office. Look out for new menu options in the coming months!
Maybe not everyone looks for simple food when paying for it in a cafe, but I\'m certainly one for straightforward comforts. This plate says it all for me, about what Punch is trying to do. Two generous heaps of cool avocado on warm, crunchy triangles of sourdough are made refreshing when doused in the juice of a thoughtfully charred lemon wedge. I enjoyed spreading the avocado thickly and evenly on the toast, topping it with half a poached egg and letting the yolk of the other half be soaked up by the underside of the toast. I also strongly recommend eating this with your hands, messy as it may be. Paired with an Ethiopian batch brew ($4), this was just what I wanted on a cool Sunday morning. After licking the avo off my fingers, I dirtied them once again while biting into the brownie cookie with espresso butter ($5), especially satisfying when you happen to get a pinch of salt in a mouthful. Wish the espresso buttercream provided more of a coffee hit, but still a lovely sweet thing to nibble on. I also enjoyed the interaction with the service staff, although some might feel otherwise about the \"verbal menu\", I for one was grateful for the unexpected intimacy, and the assertion of the point of view that this is a space for conversation and hospitality. Hopefully, you will have just as positive of an experience as I did. 
If you\'re after a minimalist breakfast of discernment, the pared down menu at newly-opened Punch will appeal. I enjoyed their hand-made-only-upon-order donuts filled with different fillings of Nutella, jam and custard wth my cup of richly nuanced hand-pour whilst seated on a bench in a beautiful courtyard.
Fried Chicken ($24 full portion), is one of the six dishes available during lunch and also strongly recommended. Crispy fried chicken coated in their special powder (slight curry taste), you may choose to dip in the blue cheese sauce or capsicum relish. \n<br />Will I head back during lunch hour for this? Maybe not, especially since there are cheaper and better alternatives nearby.\n<br />üì∑: @juicyfingers
A simple, unadulterated dish done well. \n<br />@punch.gram only had 3 things on the menu - Australian porridge, fried chicken and this. Heck, they did not even have a physical menu so they had to verbally explain the 3 items in a their extremely echoey space resulting in many \'huhs\' and \'can you say that again? I didn\'t catch that.\' As much as I appreciate the concept of mystery, I would like to know the full offerings of the space to be able to put together a dish and beverage selection that suited my mood any given day. \n<br />#burpple #punch_sg
I am on the fence about the textures from this hybrid bake. I like my brownies fudgey and my cookies either crispy or soft (not lao hong!) and this hybrid is neither super crispy (think Famous Amos) nor is it soft (think cookies from Park Bench Deli or Subway), and certainly was not as fudgey as I would like it (think salted caramel brownie from Ronin or The Plain). The Espresso buttercream was really smooth and had a good bit of espresso in it. It is, however a very generous cookie, perhaps too much for 1 person so definitely go try it with a friend. \n<br />#burpple #punch_sg
The fried chicken wore its delicious crusty curry powder-esque hide with pride, whilst elsewhere the surprisingly addictive relish was like a complicated love triangle involving grape, tomato and red pepper. 3.7/5
Egg murdering continues after a long break. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/01/27/punch/
Definitely packed a punch, like what you can expect from the same people behind Ronin and The Plain.
Meet Etine from Punch, who has to read the entire menu to me (cos there\'s no menu) and recommended this delicious fried chicken with blue cheese dip (but she says she prefer the other dip.) Still need to pose for me. So sweet right? Smile more lah! \n<br />Anyway, from PUNCH. Review here http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/01/27/punch/
Comes with mango salsa and a choice of chips or greens. Seabass was flaky and the skin was crisp and lightly seasoned with salt. Mango salsa comes pretty well with the fish, adding a little tangy flavour that lifts the flavour of the fish with a subtle numbing factor from the onions. Greens were tossed in dressing; particularly liked how they seemed to have included a bit of grilled greens (Kale, maybe?) for a crisp texture. Costs twice as much ($26++) than the PUNCH Greens, which is essentially the greens at the side but perhaps this is more value-for-money considering it\'s a fish dish and you get quite a generous amount of fish in the end.
One of the more breakfast-y meals available for lunch here; essentially warm oatmeal with br√ªl√©e bananas for sweet crunch while served with cold milk which helps to bring down the temperature of the oatmeal. Very hearty and comforting for a late breakfast during lunch indeed.
Today marks PUNCH\'s first day of operations for its brew bar, which runs from 7:30am all the way to late afternoon at the courtyard. They offer three different flavours of doughnuts here; custard, jam and Nutella. Doughnut was crisp and filled with smooth and subtly sweet, eggy custard which is pretty apt for a light bite; definitely worth picking up a few for breakfast before heading to the office. Behind is the V60 brew coffee with Kenyan beans, fruity tones with a clean flavour.
both were easily the best of its kind I ever had - the cheese toast came chewy within! this can also be counted as comfort food for rainy days üòç
Bit too acidic for my liking

No drop has been wasted. üî∏üî∏\n<br />An affogato with a sweet attitude. 2 dollops of vanilla ice cream and a chocolate cookie with espresso cream. Double shot espresso that leaves a strong robust bitter tone. The ice cream that sweetens up the palate. So now the fun starts. There goes the soft chewy cookie dunking in and out of the espresso, lapping up the ice cream.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />The end is bittersweet.

Dense creamy Mascarpone between layers of spiked coffee soaked sponge, dusted generously with cacao. My dad would love this since it isn\'t too sweet. Pretty heavily spiked too, so not for the faint hearted!

This aglio olio pasta is my favorite of all my favorite pastas.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Sitting here whilst waiting, the anticipation builds up. The aroma of it being prepared was like a savory perfume...so seductive. After afew minutes, the pasta was brought to me. The look : a golden yellow orangey hue from the pasta, red bright spots from the chilli padi, green specks of herby goodness and light beige from the little bulb that scares off vampires.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />The taste : pasta cooked aldente. Somehow it had a touch of smokyness. Prawns were small (wished it was slightly bigger), a tad overdone and scallops seared to golden brown on one side. There were lotsa crunchy garlic pieces which had a wonderful nutty flavor. But my palate was actually screaming for more heat from the chillis.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Prawns and scallops aside, I could just down the pasta on its own. The aroma, the saltyness, the oiliness, the garlicky &amp; the umaminess were just simply addictive.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Truly enjoyed my date with pasta but I missed the ever smiling face of Vincent @punch.gram \n<br />#lunch #pasta #stfoodtrending #hungrygowheresg #burpplemessyeats #burpple #8dayseat #whati8today #tripadvisor #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #openricesg #instafoodsg #instafollow #instameetfoodies #singaporeinsiders #eatbooksg #guiadogourmetrepost #chopesg @hungrygowhere

Generous dusting of icing sugar. Not overly sweet. Was a joy to eat these cos by the time lunch service was over, it was all sold out!! It was another joy cos i made 2 new lady friends. Thank you Marissa &amp; Laura @phaybulous @punch.gram for the chitchat &amp; the laughter. #doughnuts #dessert #dessertlovers #cafesg #burpple #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #neweats #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggerssg
Skin stayed crispy even after taking so long to snap. Dip in homemade tomato relish and enjoy the harmony of hot, sweet, salty, tangy n crisp flavors bursting in your mouthüòã #crispychicken #lunch #newcafesg #burpple #hungrygowhere #i8mondays #8dayseat #openricesg #singaporeeats #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggerssg
That aside, the decor inside is pretty instagrammable as well.
Delish espresso buttercream smacked in between 2 soft chewy chocolaty brownies. Not so sweet. Love love love itüòç! Shout out to Vincent @punch.gram ... thank you and all your guys for being so welcoming &amp; providing such good friendly service. #brownies #teabreak #newcafesg #cafesg #burpple #openricesg #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #singaporeeats #sgfoodies #bloggerssg #igers
