Busy place for a Friday night dinner. Very prompt service, crowd moves fast.
Uni creme, butter-poached lobster, Japonica rice, honey ponzu caviar, char-grilled cheddar cheese, sesame, chervil. This was alright for me, would have preferred it as a warm melty dish, good ingredients but didn\'t feel integrated enough as a dish. Very filling nonetheless.
S$19.90 on its own, or S$22.90 for a set - spicy indeed, tingles the lips.
Butter-poached lobster meat, roasted garlic flakes, mayonnaise, chilli, garlic. Finally hopping onto the lobster roll bandwagon - this place was a full-house at dinnertime, we sat at the counter seats, and got a \"premium\" view of the behind the scenes preparations. Yummy comfort dinner, complete with truffle oil drizzled chips and greasy pan fried bread rolls üòù Goes well with our sweet and tangy sangria lychee rosso.
finally got a taste of this crustacean at the much talked about lobster shack under the platypus brand. if pince and pints hurts your wallet, you may find this more price friendly at $23 / set (which still hurts me btw in terms of quantity). had the spicy roasted garlic with butter-poached lobster meat and roasted garlic flakes in mayonnaise and chilli. the taste was good, savory yet balanced and accentuating the lobster meat. i am so so ok if they skip the diced tomatoes and gave me more of the meat though. lol. love the casual after work vibe there at nankin row btw.
spicy diablo. the spice was really spot on, can give the truffle crisps is a miss though, lack of truffle taste.
What is there not to like with the crustacean bowl? A medley of awesomeness - unni cream, butter poached lobster, char-grilled cheddar, honey ponzu, caviar on japonica rice. All ingredients just melted together with bursting flavor. As with the lobster roll, would have given it a perfect 10 if the dish was served hot instead of lukewarm. Given it was a pretty quiet Monday, not sure why this was missed out. Nevertheless, an overall satisfying meal at Platypus! üòÑ
With the current fad on lobster roll, I\'ll admit that I\'m pretty late to try this out. Heard that reservations are a must, but Monday was pretty quiet and we got a table even without reservations. Naturally, lobster roll was a must-order and we settled for the traditional flavor. Lobster was fresh, juicy and flavorful, sandwiched between a lightly toasted brioche bun. Could have been better if the rolls came out piping hot, which was slightly disappointing that it wasn\'t. Nevertheless, definitely worth a try!
Platypus Lobster Shack serves 8 flavours of Boston lobster rolls.... was totally spoiled for choice! Was disappointed to hear how they were full house, luckily there was the take away option! Chose The Modern flavour as there were hollandaise sauce and also cheese mixed with bouncy lobster meat between two well toasted bun! A good yummy treat for $19.90!
But!  Anything for lobster roll! Platypus has 8 different flavours,  gotta the modern one cause it has hollandaise sauce &amp; cheese üòª
Spanish paprika, butter poached lobster, hollandaise, chervil; served in a grilled soft butter bun accompanied with truffled chips and organic salad greens.
Uni creme, butter-poached lobster, Japonica rice, honey ponzu, caviar, char-grilled cheddar cheese, sesame, chervil
My first lobster roll,quite delicious but the main star is the truffle crisp!That is a must! quite reasonably price for a roll i can say.
The traditional roll and spicy roasted garlic. Spicy roll is really spicy.
Lunch time boasts a snaking queue at Platypus so if you can wait, come by at 1.30pm when the crowd dies down. For $6.90, you get a box of greens, pasta/rice, vege of the day, 1 regular and 1 premium meat, topping of the day and a selection of 6 dressing choices.
Finally got a bite from one of the lobster roll places that\'s trending in Singapore. Generous fillings, and plenty of flavours to choose from.
yumz :)

|| Crisp buttered wall buns with a pile-up of lobster meat that took a fervid roll in homemade mayonnaise spiked with garlic before sitting snugly within pillowy innards ~ the final result = too much moaning and provocative finger sucking action going on over the table„ÄÇ
Asian-style risotto, butter-poached lobster, marinated garlic, chilli
The flavours were well balanced, but the creamy dressing may satiate one\'s appetite after a few spoonfuls. [Photo taken with D4S, with thanks to #NikonSingapore]
