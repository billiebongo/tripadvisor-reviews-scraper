only gripe for me was that there wasn\'t enough egg wrapping all those beancurd. but ahhh. finally had my craving satisfied! at only SGD8.80 for a big portion, this is definitely a steal!

This one damn nice!
A little pricey but still affordable. Food were all tasty!
They have quite a good spread of indonesian dishes. I took really long to choose what dishes i wanted to savour cause there were just too many, i was indeed spoilt for choice! \n<br />I had tahu telur(my all-time fav), ikan kremes, ayam panggang padang, sambal kangkong, and the particular one that i love so much is this CUMI CUMI BELADO SQUID! You\'ve gotta try this like seriously, its too nice. \n<br />On the dessert side, the Es Teler is superbbbbb though i particularly love the presence of jackfruit in it only since im not really an avocado person. \n<br />Overall the price range was quite affordable, below 20 should be enough for ala carte but if dishes and rice, maybe a little more! Its accessible too since its just across Great World City. Go try! ‚ô®‚ô®
Really good spread of indonesian food.A fan of their bbq squids.Affordable prices. Overall,thumbs up!!
