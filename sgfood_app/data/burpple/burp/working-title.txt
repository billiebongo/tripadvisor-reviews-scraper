these 3 chocolate desserts are the bomb , on the top left is the lava cake , please do eat it with water beside because it was really sweet but was still good!! On the top right is the Nutella sea salt caramel tart , caramel hidden between the Nutella the caramel is not too overpowering just subtle taste of caramel . Lastly , the s\'mores tart with toasted marshmallow (?)on the top , brings a  touch to the aesthetics and goes really well with the crust and chocolate layer !! definitely go there again !!   
sought to this backpackers\' cafe because it was halal and thumbs up to the interior design. but, the food was a no-no. eggs ben had its yolk broken before serving and there was too much sauce (which tasted weird:(), holy guacamole\'s beef patty had 0 taste and the salmon aglio olio had a poor presentation, taste wasn\'t there as well. BUT, twister fries was good and plus point to a good catch up 
Earl Grey Ice-cream Sandwich. The cookies are lemon cookies, however, i didn\'t quite enjoy it because the cookies were too soft. They weren\'t really crispy like those usual cookies outside. The earl grey ice-cream was good though! Anything earl grey is awesome. $8 for just that one ice-cream sandwich. The picture in the menu shows 2 though. Totally not worth $8 for such an ice-cream sandwich.
Weekend has been awesome and I am looking forward to the busy week ahead. \n<br />Think many of us are familar with dilmah tea but they actually have a finer selection of tea that use whole tea leaves. This results in a stronger aroma and a better enjoyment for tea.
Somehow felt that the eggs weren\'t poached enough, probably needed about 10 seconds more? But overall it was a good dish. Go try! 
Latte with a tinge of rose syrup. Wish there was a stronger dose of espresso
This gave a marvelous caffeine kick! anted their really refreshing Choco Bananarama but it\'s off the menu *sighs a billion times*. Please consider adding this on the menu again! \n<br />Oh yes and I\'m really HAPPY to know that they are on @sugar_singapore! Yay!  #workingtitlesg #workingtitle #wewantsugar
$8.90 truffle tattle tots which are just hashbrowns with truffle oil. The truffle smelled awesome but the taste was barely there. My $6.50 green tea latte was really bland. Blehhh. My friend had the big breakfast which wasn\'t very nice either. Maybe we should just get the desserts next time..oh well
Gooey Nutella appears in the center of the tart, tart tastes good as a whole and isn\'t overly salty, don\'t be intimidated by the sprinkle of salt as seen. Only downside was the crust was a little too thick and dry though. Worth a try but not a must have. 
Those who love Bandung, rejoice! (Working title) has cleverly concocted an interesting Dirty Bandung Latte, which is a creamy thick hot Bandung drink, with hints of coffee surfacing in its aftertaste. Lotus biscuit was also served on the side. 
An afternoon with a bowl of smoked duck, juicy cherry tomatoes &amp; peaches with bits of crushed nachos in it &amp; cider on the side! It\'s the best for a hot afternoon while gallivanting around the historic Kampong Glam! 
Amidst my project submissions, I\'m craving badly for this super yummy smoked salmon salad! Generous layers of smoked salad atop mixes greens &amp; juicy cherry tomatoes! All salad &amp; salmon lovers out there say hooray! 
This snack is really addictive. Tattle tots with truffle oil. The truffle oil could be stronger though.
Working title gets their beans from dutch colony which explains the smooth slightly mild bitter tone.
What a discovery! Being a lover of Horlicks (although I don\'t drink it every day because Milo &gt; Horlicks), this is pretty amazing especially in the form of a tart. The creamy centre and the Horlicks crunch topping are a marriage made in heaven. Minor downside: the crust crumble-rumble-tumbles as you cut a piece of it. Still, no reason to not lick the plate clean. 
all day breakfast sets at around $12-16 depending on your ingredients. Love the rustic feel to this cafe. With even a mini backyard that\'s so cosy and rustic. Awesome place to chill and hang out 
Unique place for gathering and really appetizing food they provide there! \n<br />Free wi-fi\n<br />Food range from $4-$15
Rösti set with Apple juice - rösti with sour cream, sausage and a pooly fried egg 
Rosti with chicken sausage &amp; sunny side up and curly fries. I would go back again for their food! Didn\'t had a chance to try their coffee though. Downside of dining in the cafe is due to the open concept kitchen, the greasy smell will linger on your hair and clothings.
Didn\'t stay long at this cafe I didn\'t wanna walk out smelling like a week\' old french fry.
Had the Nutella Valhorna Chocolate Cake which was ok but a little too dense even for a chocolate lover like me. This was from a restful Sunday (one I wouldn\'t have for a good six months after) with Denise, Meihui, Adeeb &amp; Mark! Quite liked the laid back chillax vibe too.
Full review at www.littletinysun.com   / one of the more affordable savoury pies in cafes that don\'t hold back in tantalizing your taste buds
Perfect cuppa for people who are sensitive to caffeine! Delicious for lovers of chocolate or people who need a little perk me up :)
Located in the heart of Arab Street, the one and only burger with truffle fries is a must-try. Worth every penny! And the smores pie...awesome!
The eggs were okay. but you can actually see that the bread is from Gardenia &amp; the smoked salmon is not fresh at all. Totally not worth the $10. 😤
It\'s rosti on the menu but these r definitely potato pancakes. Tastes just like the instant rosti from supermarkets n the sasuages r a tad too salty.
I don\'t normally like pastas but these days pple keep coming up with fusion and non-cream/tomato based versions that appeal more to my stomach. This was spicy from the copious amt of pepper added, but it couldn\'t mask the store-bought pasta taste. Can\'t go too wrong with smoked salmon, though would appreciate having more mushrooms added. In terms of location, nice cozy place, quite popular with students looking for a quiet place to study. #burpple
And for today it\'s Grasshopper Pie ($8.00) from Windowsill Pies! 😋#rachfoodadventure #burpple
Generous serving of the chicken sausages, love it! But the tomato pasta was disappointing 😟 #rachfoodadventure #burpple
Need a chill out place in Arab Street? This could be your midnight hiding place. 
the ice cream sandwich was good but rather pricey!!! cake was a tad too sweet, but it kinda suits my liking haha! had their mains(salmon pizza and burger), their filling was huge but it\'s really excellent 
Situated under a backpacker\'s hotel. Try their pizzas, it\'s the shizz!
Tart filled with dark chocolate with marshmellows. Not sweet. Love it but a bit pricey. 
Been wanting to try ice cream cookies&amp;co. for sooo freaking long and I was super excited when I saw that there were part of working titles!!Mega loved it!The smores pie was oookay..nothing great..Nice place for camwhoring though😉
Sick but I still need my coffee and brunch. #sgcoffee #brunch
Baked by local bakers and sold here at (working title). Cake in a jar are getting popular but this one... Instantjizznuts
$6 a slice, definitely the shizz. A few selection of home made pizzas but the hawaiian is a must-try! 👍
Rise &amp; Shine. Sunny side-up with turkey ham toast! Merry Xmas!
Cappuccino yet again.
Potato Twist (Curliest fries) with salt and pepper
The one and only working title burger. Beef patty wholemeal bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cheddar cheese with side chips.
Just a place to chill out with unique beers and bar bites in the Arab Quarters, but I have more interest in coffee than alcohol. Coffee is gently crisp in acidity, light but had a smooth silky mouthfeel. 
After long hot day... Now resting...n have a cup of coffee.. Chilling.. #sgcafe #cafe

It was rather average, although it looked and smelled promising at first -- especially given the pleasant aroma emanating from the toasted bun and the thickness of the burger.
This dish belongs to my boyfriend. I didn\'t manage to taste it but my boyfriend said the same thing about the beef patty which is soft, chewy and tender. 
Have an egg-cellent day!
True to its name, this is definitely a must-try for all bandung lovers. And it\'s in my favourite colour too!
$20

Lucky for me, they ran out of turkey ham and I got smoked salmon for a change. Everything on this plate taste as good as it looks. Especially the plain looking but really fragrant and delicious focaccia bread. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafoodsg #instafoodie #openricesg #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg  #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #workingtitle
Waited half an hour for my main but only the bacon is passable. Scrambled egg was rather bland and tasteless, while the measly 3 slices of mushrooms made it worse. Not recommended.
