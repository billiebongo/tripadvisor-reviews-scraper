Truffle fries was nice but not enough truffle oil for me! The taste didn\'t really come through but fries were crisp and yummy! 
Had been told that the eggs ben here was good, so I decided to give it a go. On the whole, it was good but quite unextraordinary. They use bacon instead of ham, and I don\'t really like bacon so I topped up $3 for parma ham for an already expensive dish ($20++). The place itself is nice but the service on that Sunday morning was terrible, understaffed and drinks took so long that by the time they arrived we had almost already finished our mains.
Spacious cafe with a lovely buzz, great service and pretty yummy food | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
Cafe Melba is great for families with kids, they have a huge grass field for kids to run about and a bouncy castle to keep them entertained. Food was just average at best, nothing to shout about.
Decent pasta with a pricey tag. Especially liking the crayfish + rocket combo. 
Green field by the side, castles on the pitch, fire by the wall &amp; glasses on the table.. A cafe in a school! Interesting find and the coffee is well done too.. Nice truffle fries and pastas are also good.. Must try for those weekend lazy wannabes! 
The free range eggs are close to being perfectly spherical. The bacon? Home-cured. Even the rocket leaves seem to have been picked for their cuteness. Everything on the plate has a touch of delicate refinement. But is it worth $20++? The jury\'s still out on that.\n
yawn, just a boring old sandwich on dry rye. not impressed. do NOT add +$4 truffle fries. they totally stinge on the truffle oil. kid and dog friendly place with lots of parking and space to run.
There was once 3 good friends, Mr Pepperoni, Mr Ham and Mr Bacon. The burden in their hearts have been to educate homo sapiens to enjoy their species. Their ultimate sacrifice, to offer themselves as a living sacrifice, yummy and pleasing to men. Henceforth, this pizza is named \"3 Little Pigs\".
Dessert of the 3 course dinner. Peach Melba from Caf√© Melba.
I was too excited by the mains, here\'s my starter. Saku Tuna Carpaccio, with Guacamole and Bloody Mary.  The 3 course meal here ($45++) includes a 500ml bottle of Fiji Water.
Beef Rendang with Fries and Pizza Roti. It actually goes very well! Part of a 3 course set dinner at Cafe Melba. The fries and roti comes in 2 separate baskets with 1 plate of rendang. Very \'Phil-ling\'!
Popular weekend hangout that is dog friendly too. There\'s even an upsized Big Breakfast to this!
Nice casual environment (family/kids/dogs friendly) - fairly decent service, but food here is a hit or miss. This is not bad (not great either), overpriced for the portion.
Nice casual environment (family/kids/dogs friendly) - fairly decent service, but food here is a hit or miss. Pizzas are good - thin and crispy.
Located within Goodman Arts Centre. Give their truffle fries a miss. Prices are a little high. Nice place to gather with friends. 
Not the best eggs, but decent enough to satisfy my craving. Truffle fries were pretty rad.
No eeky black and stained teeth after having it cos the squid ink was rolled into the pasta. Sauce was salty yet goes well with the pasta and clams. Worth a try and the walk from Mountbatten station. :)
Very so-so and small portion. But the venue makes up for the mediocre food.
Roasted Chicken Pizza! Pretty Decent! The chicken is a little overcooked..

Crayfish pasta ($27) and the Melba burger ($25) were lovely and the glass house completed the entire experience. üòå
Nice place to chill. Carrot cake was not bad too.

Poached eggs, dark rye bread, hashbrowns (love their hashbrown) and sauteed veggies. Yum! Though their poached eggs were not very good\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.

Whatever, let\'s tuck in first.
They didn\'t serve brunch at about 3 and I still have no idea why :-( but we got their \"Three Little Pigs\" pizza ($22) it was delish but too pricey! Very filling for 2 people though! But great pizza - love the meat and thin crust!
