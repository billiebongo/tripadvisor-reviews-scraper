Besides the incredibly delish truffle lava egg here, they serve up some pretty decent protein waffles and muffins. Just look at that chocolate dip go drip drip drip
I decided on a choice of mozzarella chicken, sweet potato mash (it was Jap sweet potato!!), truffle edamame and a lava egg, all for 11.90! It was so so so worth it for the unexpected Flavours these came in, so vastly different from the bland health food that other places offered. Portion was ginormous too! Luv luv, will be back
2nd plate of DIY Lean Bento ($11.95). Chicken was skinless, which I appreciate. Flavour tastes like mild satay sauce - I preferred the salmon from my previous post, though üí≠
Protein Muffins - good for those who work out, I suppose? Fairly moist &amp; dense on the inside, served warm which is AWESOME. I like the black sesame one, but the cocoa one is nice too üëç Coffee\'s pretty solid, matcha latte could be stronger.
Customize your own Lean Bento ($11.95) - choose 1 complex carb, 2 sides, 1 protein, ... &amp; you have no choice for the salad, but I wouldn\'t have chosen otherwise; the leafy greens were fresh &amp; crisp, &amp; the honey miso sauce was decadent üëå üçØ

A healthy breakfast which is far from being bland and boring? I just found one! The 8-day old bento shop was previously in the CBD area, serving takeaways. In their new outlet they offer a lot more seating space, with a pretty wide options from breakfast items to lunch bentos, to snacks and desserts. My chicken breast sausage with scrambled eggs, protein waffle, tatter tots and mesclun salad was yums! The herbs lent a good flavour to the otherwise one-dimensional chicken breast sausage while the sweet protein waffle helped to create a good balance in the dish. This is a great place for health-conscious people and/or those with diet restrictions as they offer nutritional information for each dish online as well as the super clear information on gluten, dairy and meat content for each dish. And the super cosy modern minimalist interior was just another excuse for me to chill there longer!\n
Stay calm and eat clean! Eating clean and eating in with fellow colleagues! Ordered lean bento online and was delivered between the stipulated time. However it\'s turned a little cold upon arrival to our office. All of us felt that maybe the portion could be more generous to feel fuller. On the other hand, the seasoning was tasty though! 
This Protein muffin (dark chocolate flavour, SGD4.90), at half the calories (300kCal) of a normal muffin, tastes surprisingly good! It isn\'t bland nor flat, in fact it tasted pretty much like a normal muffin, with a more nutty taste. I like üëçüëç
Truly healthy dish as there was no sauces to accompany it, which can be a disappointment if u do not like tasteless dish. There was no particular taste to the chicken, only a hint of cheese and burnt taste due to the torching of the cheese and chicken. The greens accompanying was even more bland and tasted very raw. 
This was really good. The egg was a little cold. Broccoli was okay though some may not like the texture that much. The chicken is so good though!!! The meat is well marinated and tender enough. I can\'t get enough of the melted cheese that sits atop the chicken. All in all a satisfying lunch.
Basically what my colleague had. The salmon is well marinated with the soya sauce and not over cooked at all, hence retaining the juicy texture. Broccoli pretty much standard as with all Lean Bento set. The spaghetti was okay. I still prefer what I had even though it was full of greens.
Wanting to get SHOU? \n<br />These are some of the salads I tried in the CBD area of Raffles Place. \n<br />Am starting to make trips down to Shou Slimming Centre at One Raffles Place, and since am nearby, make it a point to also eat healthier by having lunches or dinners at the salad shops in the vicinity.
If you\'re on a carb cycling diet and you\'re on low carb day like your boy here, then Lean Bento is one of the few choices where you can cut the carbs to cut the blubber.
Ordered in during our office lunch and the delivery was fast and earlier than expected. The food calories and nutritional values were all clearly stated on the bento. I ordered the burnt cheese chicken bento with donburi which tasted like gluttonous rice while the chicken was slightly salty due to the cheese. There were a lot of coleslaw vegetable but without the mayo hidden under all the ingredients and I was so stuffed from eating all that dry grass! All of my colleagues couldnt finish their share. This cost about $11.70 after discount (yay for promo code). 
In anticipation of the upcoming festive feasting, I decided to eat clean, well maybe just a day. \n<br />But I was really surprised at how healthy meal can be delicious too! Tried their Sea-salt Salmon laksa pasta, which is only available on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. \n<br />Love the slab of sea-salt lemon salmon which is moist and tender! The laksa pasta is flavourful yet not overly spicy. Topped with a runny onsen egg, I totally love this  healthy bento! At 489kcal, I definitely feel good and guilt-free eating this. Lol!

Tried the new garlic chilli chicken. Loved the chicken but absolutely hate the new packaging. Felt like there was little room to move things around. And pasta was bland. This is not worth $11.90 at all. I\'ll choose daily cut over this anytime. 
Choice of protein, don/pasta/salad. Salmon was cooked perfectly and lightly marinated with teriyaki sauce and sesame. Runny onsen egg. Favourite broccoli and tomato on the side, cabbage buried under (so crunchy!!). Definitely another guilt-free yet tasty option in the CBD (except that I opted for pasta carbs carbs carbs!!! Which made me really full so I shall just stick to salad the next time.)
Oh look how thick and chunky the chicken pieces are. They are so tender juicy and flavorful! Been eating this 3 times a week! üòã
Didn\'t enjoy this as much as the shoyu sesame chicken. Meat was slightly on the dry side and the gravy was just quite dreadful :/ 
Chicken is very juicy and flavorful, maybe just a tad too salty, love the rice balls. Wished the egg  came in a different form. It was overall very filling and reasonably priced at $12 (453cal) added a paleo coconut juice (90cal) $2.50 top up 
A creamy tomato chicken bento that\'s low in fat and carbs? No way. But wait, it\'s a reality at Lean Bento! Delicious, tender and juicy chicken chunks that were evenly cooked to tender perfection despite the irregular sizes of the chicken fillets, surprisingly pillowy and soft brown rice nuggets, and well seasoned veggies are the proud members of this healthy yet indulgent bento. Oh, did I forget to mention the perfect onsen egg cozily nestled next to the chicken? The matcha and honey tea I ordered on the side was very, VERY sweet. I was expecting the typical bitterness of a good matcha tea, but instead I got a mouthful of sweet green tea. It\'s a very refreshing drink, but it\'s a little over the top with the sweetness though.
I tried this salt baked salmon this time round. Yummy! \n<br />Love the fluffy slice of salmon baked to perfection, as it retains its moisture and tenderness. Their new addition of onsen egg is runny and cooked just perfectly.
The salmon portion was quite generous and nicely baked medium well. Didn\'t really like the seasoning to the chicken patties as much. In terms of taste, I think this is a bit lacking compared to Grain, but still a satisfying healthier option meal.
Count your calories! The parmesan chicken set (I can\'t recall how many calories the whole set was), is enough to fill you up, and surprisingly has a nice variety all in one bento box. The bento boxes are a convenient way to pick up and go too so you can avoid dining with all the lunch crowds.
If you are working in the CBD, especially in the Raffles Place area, here\'s Lean Bento a guilt free lunch option for the fellow office drones. Packed with high-protein, low-carb and low-calories, the bento ingredients are freshly prepared, healthy and beautifully presented.
