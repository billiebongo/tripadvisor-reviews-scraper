Vegetarians, take note. Healthy and hearty, this is guilt-free dining with no compromise on flavour. The mix of premium ingredients include broccoli, quinoa, super leaves, nuts and sprouts, all tossed in an Asian-inspired dressing of coriander and pomegranate raita. On top of all that, it is also gluten-free. Wow.\n<br />.
Here\'s the crowd favorite, Har Cheong Gai Chicken Waffles $24! That Intense shrimp paste chicken is flavorful, rest on top of the waffle and sunny side up. And accompanied with Sambal maple syrup. This southern-style with a Singapore twist is done right. 😋 (Locals will love this but  Caucasians may find this stinky 🙊)
If your first thought was - \"Not another fried chicken and waffles?!!\", I can understand, given the appearance of this dish in many cafes\' menus. But let me tell you, \"Stinky Meets Crispy Chicken Waffles\" was a far more interesting rendition by House at Dempsey.\n<br />Firstly, the fried chicken was actually \"har jeong gai\" or fermented shrimp paste-battered chicken. And the intensity of pungency of these here beats those I\'ve eaten at many \"zi char\" places hands down.\n<br />I must admit, I\'m not a fan of soft, doughy-style waffles but in this case, the lightly-crisp finish of this rice flour version, actually paired well with the mega-crunchy-skinned chicken, especially when eaten with the organic sunny-side-up egg, and with their appetising sambal maple syrup poured all over.
Naturally, the Tiffin Punch would come in a tiffin carrier. After unpacking, we discovered each level contained a single person\'s portion of the gin and grapefruit cocktail. Served separately in a small jug was the lychee liqueur that is suppose to be added prior to drinking. It enhanced the cocktail with a light sweetness which I liked. Do expect a subtle hint of young ginger because that was included as well. I found its heat pretty faint. Hence, even if you don\'t like ginger, I doubt it would cause you grief. 
Can\'t believe that this simple looking dish could deliver so much satisfaction! Ok, so maybe the fact that it includes caramelised bacon already makes it a winner… but the chefs even go into the detail of using specifically Demerara brown sugar to caramelise the bacon!\n<br />Layer that with spicy tomato jam and cream cheese then top it off with a sunny side up egg all sitting nicely in a grilled naan roll… they call this a prescription for hangovers that will comfort all your troubles away. 🙌🏻 I would totally have to agree with that. Eat it all away~\n<br />#HouseAtDempsey
Touted as the perfect hangover cure, I can totally see this working like a dream. After all, when you wake up with a throbbing head, something with rich flavours is very welcome.\n<br />I like the puffiness of the lightly toasted naan bread to begin with. But it\'s what were folded in it that really got me grinning. The unifying force of cream cheese, strips of candied bacon (they make it in-house with the best Demerara sugar), grilled tomatoes, a sunny-side-up egg plus a sweetish chilli jam manages to ignite a most delicious blast. 
The last time I was here was 3 years ago I think. So glad they\'ve revamped their menu since then because I\'ve so many favourites, especially the curry leaf brownie and the ultra moist banana cake! 😋\n<br />-\n<br />More on my Dayre 👉🏻 http://dayre.me/vanessatlx!
The zaalouk is surprisingly sweet, and there is a welcome brush of cumin. But the scallops seemed a little overdone.
You know this ain\'t your neighbourhood burger when you hear the patty\'s laced with bone marrow. Think juicy well-seasoned 🐮, topped with fried onion rings, cabbage, sharp Provolone, housemade spicy mayo, and bacon jam — all of that snuggled between house-made brioche buns. My only — and biggest — peeve is that the patty was way overcooked; it could be inexperience in prepping tasting portions for a big tasting, so I\'m pretty sure nailing the cooking time would result in a pretty awesome 🍔 those sweet potato nibblets could do without all the extra coarse sugar though.
Hokkaido scallops, eggplant zaalouk, Spanish Migas  — lovely ideas, and pretty good topped with a generous squeeze of lemon juice; but the hits were a tad too big to ignore. Scallops were rubbery and way overcooked, zaalouk was too sweet, and the iconic Migas tasted like plain ol\' breadcrumbs. Really good ideas here, so all they really need to do is clean up on the execution.
Saturday brunch at House @ Dempsey for their revamped menu. First up, the Portobello Schitzel Bun (Suitable for Vegetarians), Arugula bun sandwiched with crispy breaded portobello and provolone cheese &amp; slathered with homemade spicy mayo sauce &amp; apple green slaw.
Healthy is exactly what\'s on this plate. The risotto have a good mix of rice, giving a good bite in every mouthful. Done just right, this plate isn\'t overcooked and mushy (as you all know, a good risotto is hard to find). I particularly love it, that they sprinkle pomegranate on top, giving the dish a small surprisingly burst of sweetness. The grilled eggplant and carrot, charred every so lightly, brought Colours and life into the already quite splendid dish. 
I absolutely adored my order! For the soft &amp; mild cheese lovers this is for you. The Brie used here has a mild cheese aftertaste that makes finishing the 2 thick stripes of it on your own a breeze. (IMO, although it was recommended for sharing) Especially when you are paring it with some well toasted, buttered artisan bread and a tangy fruit side. Oh and how could I forget the chopped pistachios that added a crunchy element. This is definitely \"regaling on a plate of well played flavors\". Yes factoring the ingredients, the thought &amp; effort that went into this dish, it is a luxurious \"feast\" that resonated with the use of the verb \"regale\". 
This cake nicely incorporates some familiar local flavours that we all love. While making a twist on pandan cake is not that novel anymore, House does a pretty darn good version - soft pandan sponge spread with coconut cream and drizzled with a generous serving of gula melaka. One slice might not be enough!
LOVED this salad for its variety of greens which gives it nice crunchy textures and different flavours. Great for sharing and to start the meal!
Four eggs in a single pan, make this pan protein overload. Best that you share with someone. Colourful in shades of purple, green, red and yellow, this happy pan win me over on a Saturday morning. Eggs-wise, these baked eggs are well seasoned, with hidden bacon bits and crab meat. Although, I found the crab meat is lacking in quantity (after all, it is a crabby omelette). Other than that, the pan still makes me all happy. Just cause! 
A must order, whenever I have a chance to be here. It\'s not the truffle drizzled oil that caught my attention, but rather the ultra thin string-like fries that got me wowed. So crisp, it\'s like eating twigs, only Super yummy, and ultra addictive. Taro fried til this crisp should deserve every award. The batter coats them lovingly that it\'s literally having a party in my mouth. And worth every penny thrown in, the portion don\'t disappoint. Great for starters or nick-nacks. 
So disappointing. Nicely plated, but it is pretty much downhill from there. The pork was tough and quite dry, and there wasn\'t much sauce to go around to make up for its dryness. The accompanying sides were nothing spectacular either. Overall, really mediocre, and definitely not worth the price. I think you would be better off trying their risottos or paellas. 
It\'s so awesome that this place serves a nice variety of fries (there are a few more apart from these two). The sweet potato ones were nicely cooked - crispy outside and fluffy inside, and coated with the right amount of sugar. The taro truffle fries were great - thinly cut such that each bite is just crispy truffle goodness. The bad thing was that it was quite oily - the oil had pooled at the bottom, giving us a pretty horrifying sight of what was a pretty large pool of oil. Not the best way to end the dish. 
Crispy and flavorful, i could finish one whole serving by myself. This is probably the only dish worth trying at House tbh.
Interesting name for a drink. I am assuming from this that Elvis liked blended bananas with peanut butter. Order this if you like something sweet and salty.
This is part of their weekend branch menu. A healthy light start to the day and an alternative if you are not into eggs and bacon.
the chicken waffle at lazy susan. somewhat loved the fried chicken very much, but found the waffle lacking in some ways. that chilli maple was a killer though.
☺️ The buffet spread is not limit to sweets only, there\'s a fair variety of savoury items as well! 😊👌🏻
😍 Vibrant shade of orange oozing out over curried Indian spiced corn pancakes and tomato coconut chutney. The Lazy Susan pop up will be housed at House at Dempsey (pun intended) till 27 December 2015 and then moving over to Open Door Policy early next year.
The restaurant showcases a new take on traditional ethnic  cuisine, hawker fare and dim sum. Rather on the pricey side, dishes ranging from $8-22, but experimental and adventurous. Thanks to @honeybeesweets.sg for asking me along!
An extremely unique hawker fusion brunch which in my opinion was too much of fancy names and trying to be over creative and food that didn\'t taste good. Then again, maybe I just couldn\'t appreciate it. Bring back the old menu please!

House at Dempsey just released a new menu for their Hi-Tea Buffet.
Whilst the Orange Sweet Potatoes Tart was starchily suited and the coffee soil-topped Caramel Banana Cake Flowerpot was like Hermione Granger in salt class, the rich Curry Leaf Almond Brownie swished its savoury saree in glee and the yummy sweet gloop atop the Avocado and Chocolate Cake would be great for both your throat and your face. The quality of sweets here should sufficiently please the undemanding Longchamp-toting tai-tais for their midday tête-à-têtes, while the sexy gardenesque ingredients and flavour combinations will pique the interest of inner arm-tattooed, blue hair-streaked indie hipster power females. 
—————\n<br />A scrumptious hi-tea buffet with an extensive spread of both savoury and sweets at $30++. Good cakes and tarts with everything you need to make the afternoon perfect. Only on Thursday &amp; Friday.
Asian sliders. It\'s actually pork belly with steamed buns. This is one dish with very overwhelming spices and herbs and it\'s a little salty for my liking. I like the ideal of assemble this dish by myself. I would like it more if it\'s not so salty and provide some lettuce or greens to balance the oiliness of it. I changed the fries to sweet potato fries!! #brunch #house #Dempsey #porkbellybuns #porkbelly #asiansliders
This place is in a hidden corner. Nvr knew it existed. It\'s right at back facing the lush greenery. Ambience is very fresh. Amazing view and a chilled out place, perfect for a Sunday Brunch. We had the tofu and mushroom salad, fish croquette, Squid Ink paella, and truffle fries. Everything was good but the Squid Ink Paella is to die for! I\'m not a fan of squid ink dishes but this was way beyond amazing. It tasted so good, slightly spicy. Also, the smoothies and juices are very fresh. Food: 9/10, Ambience: 10/10, Service: 10/10
Finally got to try this today with the APAC Marketing Team from work - on a drizzly Friday afternoon. Such a rare indulge, Alice-in-Wonderland style 😊
A rewarding, work-day chi-chi hi-tea with the APAC Marketing Team. Cosy catch-up with everyone over fancy little bites, at such a charming little hideout. Great prelude to the weekend! 😘😘😘
A refreshing blend of blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, lemon and mint. $13.50. A tad overpriced for the portion given (it\'s such a small mason jar!), but tastes really good.
Interlaced with dried fruits, crushed nuts, slatherings of nutella, and topped off with fresh berries and maple syrup - House\'s 7-layered pancakes have remained one of my favourites. It\'s just so colourful and fun to eat! 
More than six months have passed since I was last here and the menu has been refreshed with the addition of new dishes alongside their ever-popular ones like the Bay Prawn Capellini. I tried their Crab Omelette today and it turned out decent but not something I\'d order again.\n<br />Made with four eggs, the texture falls neither into categories of \"light and fluffy\" nor \"silky and creamy\". Instead, its firmness reminds me more that of a frittata. I was initially concerned the presence of bacon might drown out the delicate flavour of the fresh crabmeat but it didn\'t happen because there\'s only a hint of it. The garlic croutons added some crunch but I\'m not sure why the few slices of purple sweet potatoes were there except to perhaps grace the omelette with some colour. I\'m thankful for the little blobs of mayo because they helped add tastiness to the dish.\n<br />Service at Barracks was earnest (we had two staff approach separately to ask us how was the food) but there were still slip-ups (they didn\'t serve us any water until I asked for it and that was after we had settled the bill). \n<br />I would return but it would be for other dishes. 
Ordered medium rare and medium well came. Returned it and the new one was perfect! Medium rare to perfect. They even topped up my fries cause it was cold and replaced it to freshly fried fries. Best service and quality! Ambience was amazing too. Just like dining in a forest. Perfect night (: 
Lamb Cutlet\n<br />Tender cutlets of lamb, given the Indian spice treatment. Marinated in turmeric and yoghurt, tossed onto the grill to a fragrant, caramelised char. Served with a savoury mango chutney and spicy chickpeas. From the house menu
The Elegant Black Pepper Prawn Linguine\n<br />Succulent char-grilled prawns served atop a pile of linguine and prawn bolognese tossed in black pepper sauce. Finished with a sprinkling of salmon caviar for a luxurious touch. From the house menu
Our food choices are a good representation of how distinct we are. 😂 @post_eatz
Absolutely in love with House\'s supersized tau sar paos. Soft and fluffy bun encasing a lightly sweetened red bean paste: heart warming. I love tau sar paos, and it\'s really surprising that House\'s beats those from several specialty pao stalls.
After my first visit 5 years ago, House remains one of my favourite café-ressies. The space is beautiful, and the food is consistently great. Do try the carrot cake (adorably named Orange Blossom) which IMHO is one of the best, the black pepper linguine, and definitely the skinny pizzas. So much ❤
Haven\'t posted anything in awhile cause 1) finals were demanding attention, and 2) food poisoning made looking at any food utterly unfanthomable and revolting. 
Explosion of umami in this black pepper seafood linguine. Review on www.ms-skinnyfat com Active link in bio!
These are some of the delectable desserts from House\'s refreshed menu.
the chicken were done right - tender and tasteful, unlike normal bland chicken sandwich which uses sauce elsewhere. also, the avocado give the whole item a very healthy look, negating that chunky sweet potato fries \n<br />have a good weekend folks!
Woke up on the crazy side of the bed and so I\'m hyper. 😁 time to go get things down before the post long weekend depression sets in. Remember to treat yourself to some TLC. Cakes are good but juices are better. Beet Apple Mint  juice to satisfy the c6h12o6 craving.
Will be sharing more about the dishes in the next few days.
Steak was done medium rare and enjoyed it very much. Meat was soft, tender and juicy. This usually comes with croquette but it\'s one of those occasions that it is not available. With the meat already sliced, this makes the almost perfect business lunch option.
Light on the bite. A wise choice for a side dish.
Thought the cake sounded very tropical. But when I ate it, I was a tad disappointed, the flavours didn\'t go very well together..
House has nice ambience and interior for a nice dinner date. Had the hangar steak and the ahi tahi skinny pizza. The steak was amazing! So fresh and literally melts in your mouth. Love the croquette with creamy potato, cheese and ham as well! As for the pizza, it was a nice combo, with tuna, pistachio,rockets and raisins but the crust was a little too soggy...
Super shoe string fries. Would have preferred the fries to be cut a little thicker though. Half way through, just felt like I was eating dough. It\'s a nice snack if you just need something crispy though.
S$19.00 per drink served in a glass container. Order 3 drinks at the price of S$35.00
😍😍 Hahaha!Thank you @lkkben for being my hand model!!😜😝 Part of my 4S memory..😅
🙆 It was very interactive and engaging, which I really love. Thank you @olisarig for the memorable night! 😉 Gosh, it is hard to make food looks delicious using mostly monochrome settings. Hur hur. 😅That\'s steak and sausage. 😂
Despite being rather out of the way, perched atop Dempsey, House is a place that I\'ll always find myself coming back to. The ambience is very laid back and is reminiscent of some of the cafes in Aussie.  The space is huge, The food isn\'t overly priced and tastes decent too. It\'s a particularly popular venue for birthday celebrations as well. On this visit, I got myself the usual: Hanger Steak with croquettes and wild mushrooms. Well it\'s more of a mushroom reduction than actually mushrooms. But still, the mushroom reduction complemented the tender slices of beef that came with it. It wasn\'t overly strong, allowing the main highlight of the dish which was the beef, to shine. I would recommend eating the croquettes immediately upon being served so that the hot creamy ham bechamel can just burst into your mouth. Good food and good company, I certainly enjoyed my visit to House.
I usually jump straight into these after a few savoury items! :P Chocolate banana cake and carrot cake were outstanding! We were also impressed by their mini lemon meringue tart! Salted caramel macaron was not overly sweet so I quite enjoyed it! The rest on the plate were just the usual buffet dessert items but they still tasted pretty decent! :)
Finally able to bring him here! So rare for him to have a halfday off on a weekday! Here are the first few items we took! Their squid ink bun was surprisingly good and we love their mini truffle pizza! Took quite a few in subsequent rounds! ^^
Very much like a tiramisu, except that it didn\'t contain alcohol and the ladyfingers were replaced by a thick layer of chocolate mousse. It can start to get too sweet and rich after a few spoonfuls, so share this with a friend or two!
Their macarons were actually pretty good! Caramel and chocolate. Be warned... The caramel is VERY sweet.
Going to start attacking the cakes soon!
It\'s available every Thursday and Friday from 3-5.30pm.
Extra yellow yolk that oozes out perfectly. Spinach is fresh and tasty. Beware of the exploding juicy tomatoes. #burpple
The food here wasn\'t fantastic but I will return for their desserts. If you come early enough, before the crowd, you get to enjoy the place all to yourself. The vibe is definitely worth the trip! Additionally, their toilet is really gorgeous😉
Big fluffy french toast w berry x yogurt stuffing. Pretty but the flavours and textures didn\'t do it for me. Nice brunch spot though with plenty of options!
A party that you can\'t miss! And what not for their sweet treats and golden bites as options for the high tea buffet. Never say no when comes to this. I will go on and on if there wasn\'t any time limit 😂 
The donut is so soft and it really melts in the mouth. Definitely no calories wasted. Accompanied with a chocolate dip which complements the donut!
An all time favourite in the eggs section of the brunch menu. Prawns are truly flavourful and amazing~
Atas kong ba pau rofl. Done really well with some really unexpectedly appetizing sides, taro fries.
While out for drinks at House, we decided to order fries to share. After much deliberation, we settled on the Taro Fries with Truffle Oil, and the Curry Mustard Fries. The former, which all of us preferred, is basically super skinny strips of yam that\'s been fried till crisp and flavoured with truffle oil. The latter which was shoe string fries coated in curry powder was much too \"dusty\" for my liking.
Compared to what\'s out there these days, this doesn\'t seem as special anymore. What I did like: the fresh toast which had a nice fragrance, crisp bacon strips, spinach, the fried potato and mushroom as well as the grilled tomatoes on the vine. What I wasn\'t that fond of: the bland sausage and my much-too-well-done eggs which were meant to be \"overeasy\". 
Finally got to try the much raved about House. Taro smells finger licking good! 
ok, and this sums up my 2x8= sweet 16 celebration. Thank you guys and thank you for the lovely photo @sporeboyindelhi . :)) #work #lunch #birthday

S$36 - the peppery aroma surrounds you when it\'s served 
The chocolate banana cake was our favourite item in this tea buffet! It was so moist and rich... every bite tasted so blissful! We were so in love with it that we had 4 slices! (The lasagna was a last minute addition to the plate, hence the weird sweet and savoury combination!)
Love the earl grey mousse in shot glasses (top right hand corner)! We went for seconds! :D
Golden crispy toast with multiple berry stuffing!! Light for the sweet morning.. 😊😊
Interesting menu printed on newspaper. We tried their veal cheeks with caramelized onions and mash skinny pizza. The veal was melt in your mouth tender. Lovess!
From a Vintage Tea Party with the girls on the weekend, to brunch with the family, or a dinner with friends, House is a great spot for gatherings of any kind. Order food to share when you\'re at House, especially their Skinny Pizzas and wide variety of fries. Don\'t miss their desserts either, the chocolate tart is to die for. Make reservations early!
Since ppl say they miss my photos. Haha. (And really videos are so tough cos instagram video files are always corrupted or hanging.) Anyway, this is the new cover pic for my FaceBook too. Really like this quail egg with asparagus dish.
Spent a lazy afternoon sipping tea while chatting with my girlfriends here 
Came here for a high tea buffet. Only $25++ for a platter of savouries (pizzas, sliders, bread, pasta) and a wide variety of cakes (tarts, pastries and cookies). The buffet is only on Thursdays and Fridays, 3-530pm. Remember to make reservations before going down! 
$26.75 (after all the ++) per pax! Wide array of sweet and savoury food items. Worth it imo and everything is so pretty!
Came here for a high tea buffet and was pleasantly surprised to find my favourite  pizza! Got to try the other skinny pizzas too!
Portions are big and dishes are quite yummy! Worth the price! 
It\'s so popular, you have to go right when the buffet starts to get the full spread. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you ;)
Here at House @ Dempsey trying out their vintage tea party buffet. This has got to be the best way to spend an afternoon :)
Loving the vintage tea party set up. And the spread looks amazing!
: foreground left taste like moist banana cake pop coated in chocolate n lots of nuts while the one on the right seems to hav pineapple tart fillings on top with pumpkin purée below (😁?) : those two in the backgrd, 👼 gawd knows how many I ate 😸😻🎋
🍴 Mini beef slider burger : onions, cucumber and a thick beef patty 🐮 sandwiched btw toasted bun 🍔🍔
Well, another traditional chinese meal rebrand in a western restaurant.  Firstly, the taro truffle fries are worth mentioning,  the moment i ate it, i couldnt stop! As for the bun, its awesome as well just that the meat is pretty normal to me. My ah ma kong ba bao still beats it hands down.
\'Kong Ba Bao\', a good fusion of braised lean pork belly in hot stone and wrap it with bao (bun) in a pretty unique Asian way. Top it up with truffle fries: specially good.
Creamy, celeriac soup with celery and scallops. (I think) A recommended at House.
Tummy satisfying dinner w the mama &amp; the bro @killerz2918 // Pumpkin fries w hazelnut, the best pumpkin risotto I\'ve had ever, Roasted Cod Fish w sweet date sauce &amp; Flourless chocolate cake #dinner #food

Har Cheong Gai which was quite brilliant, utterly crisp and succulent and fully infused with prawn paste but the rice flour used to make the waffle just made it too hard and brittle - it would be lovely to just get the chicken over some rice and their spicy sauce to drizzle :)\n<br />#chickenwaffles #harcheonggai #prawnpaste #dempseyhouse #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #sunnysideup
Full of sinful fats to last you a gastronomic week, what was enjoyable was the perfectly seasoned pattie which has a satisfying quotient of beef goodness coupled with it being cooked just medium to lock in all the fatty juices and moisture. The sweet potato fries could have done without the extraneous sugar dusting but that burger, man is that awesome :)\n<br />#burger #dempseyhouse #bonemarrowburger #sgfood #foodporn #burpple

Reminiscing a high tea session from weeks ago where there\'s a revamp of the high tea menu. On my plate was a made to order sandwich with medium done beef, squid ink pizza, mushroom pizza, salami on cracker, truffle salmon roulade and so much more at the buffet line! 😍😍These little goodies come bite size and don\'t forget to make a beeline for the tantalizing desserts as well!

Dive into a world of dainty sweet treats such as the ::Sweet Potato pie:: and ::Avocado Chocolate cake:: placed on immaculately designed pedestals on one of the most picture worthy buffet displays you\'ll ever see！// More pictures and information now on the blog！
.\n<br />House\'s highly popular hi-tea is back again because it\'s thurs finally!😁 Available from 3pm-5.30pm every thurs and fri!☺️
Massively missing this {Marilah Onde Onde cake} from @dempseyhouse tonight。～ fragrant sponge cake layered with a lightly sweetened pandan cream and crowned with a heavy drizzle of gula melaka sauce。
In need of some #sweetremedy in the form of this {Valrhona Chocolate Red Velvet} doused in a healthy drizzle of tangy Raspberry sauce。\n<br />～～～～～\n<br />Too good, if you ask me, it might even help me forgive that guy... 😶 This treat is available everyday at @dempseyhouse or even at their Thurs/Fri Afternoon Tea time sessions if you\'re feeling extra naughty。\n<br />～～～～～\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #cakecakecake #houseatdempsey #burpple #hungrygowhere #justdessertsg #sweetnothings #eyecandySorted #cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood

A buffet style with wide range of savoury and sweets that is really worth the price tag. #houseofdempsey #dempsey #hitea #dempseyhouse #dempseyhill #burpple
// reminiscing the High Tea session at @DempseyHouse ~ held every Thurs and Fri, you\'ll be treated to a lovely display of both sweet and savory treats ranging from tuna croquette sliders (👍) to purple sweet potato pie and curry leaf brownie slice, super dope! ~~~~~~\n<br />Do make sure to make reservations as the buffet seems highly popular amongst the ladies and the premises were stuffed to the brim when I visited! Meanwhile, as we drink our livers to the brink of extinction, have a great weekend folks！
Today it was the roasted lamb that was seasoned superbly and with a nice herb of mint to mask any gaminess. The meat was nice and tender too, my fav part of today\'s high tea! :)\n<br />#roast #lamb #mint #hightea #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple
~ tuck into a myriad of Savouries such as tuna sliders, roast beef open sandwiches and sweet treats such as avocado chocolate cake and lemon balm pound cake! To die for is their Vanilla Sky Tea！\n<br />～～～\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #instafood_sg #sgfoodporn #whati8today #burpple #hungrygowhere #igsg #singaporeinsiders #sipandgulp #dempseyhouse

And I honestly think it\'s the one of the few food that\'s nice to eat at House. Which is pretty sad.. #housedempsey #dempsey #barracksdempsey #truffle #fries #tarofries #yam

Sinfully rich with dark chocolate from top to bottom. Bitter? Not really, as I still found it pretty sweet. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #sgdesserts #dessertsg #chocolate #sweettooth
Unique smoked powder-infused fries served with addictive lime ketchup. Would be perfect if they had added less salt to the fries. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #fries

Trust House to always have perfectly poached eggs. 
Cold cuts. I really like the ham. 
Located at Dempsey is House. One major thing that I love about House is their variety of fries! Taro fries, sweet potato fries, truffle fries and those regular fries.
Food should be best appreciated with awesome company:D missing you @ee_justin!
It\'s an inky affair!
Awesome! Tender and flavorful!!!
