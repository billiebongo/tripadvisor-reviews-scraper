it\'s Friday and we had a great lunch.  something different and really good army stew from wang dae bak. a really good place for korea food imo. have a good weekend y\'all
Their bbq chicken is a must try. A little pricey but worth the money.
Haemul Panjeon, or Korean seafood pancake, is a must-order for me here.
My favourite Korean bbq joint, Wang Dae Bak never fails to satisfy with its spread of perfectly marinated meats, refreshing banchan side dishes and signature liquid egg poured from a teapot straight into  the semi-circular hotplate moulds to form slightly sweetish  yet delicate egg cakes that I can\'t get enough of. Best accompanied with a bottle of Chum Churum soju and in the company of good friends.
That’s why this meal was more flustered and wasted than it was appreciated.
Happy tummy with people I\'ve known since I was..7? 
Korean BBQ for dinner!
Huge-ass seafood pancake crispy and filling, we had a tough time finishing the whole. 
One of my fave korean dish, other than spicy rice cakes, cold noodles! 
Hello Baby 보고 싶어요 I Miss You! 🇰🇷
A must-eat at every Korean meal. Grilled pork belly 삼겹살 ❤️
Seafood Pancake! One of my love and I also ate my favorite spicy rice cakes but it was not featured.
New item on Dae Bak Menu - Beef Stew with noodles.
Korean affairs for lunch today. The spicy rice-cakes and gyoza ain\'t as yummy as before.
Ddeokbokki 떡볶이 - Spicy Korean Rice Cakes from Dae Bak Korean Restaurant. I don\'t take spicy food, but this is one of those I actually love! Need to train myself, before the real trip comes in 74 days! 🇰🇷
Back at Dae Bak for korean lunch! My Hot Clay Mixed Vegetables with Minced Beef Rice aka Bibimbap!

Korean Appetizers 🇰🇷 Beancurd, Preserved Vegetables, Mashed Potato, Kimchi and Eggies
Tasty kimchi pancake that opens up your appetite (S$19).
Why this place is awesome - they don\'t give crappy banchan! Even the most basic kimchi doesn\'t taste like those commercial ones. And that beancurd skin thing is sooo good (I usually go for 3 servings). Sometimes they have this lotus root with sesame. That\'s great too.
💕\n<br />Their beef was impressive, not in photo \'coz already in our stomach! 😜 It was thick, flavourful and tender. 🤤\n<br />#burpple #simplejoys #colleaguestofriends

Hot or cold, this is a great dish to share between 2-3 people. Korean noodles, luncheon meat, kimchi and different cuts of sausages, what more can you ask for? So stop thinking about what to eat for lunch or dinner and grab one TODAY!  #wueat #sgeat #foodie #8dayseat #instafood #sgfood #korean #daebak #burpple
