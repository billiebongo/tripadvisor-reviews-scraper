2.5 munchies: Featuring freshly-laid quail eggs from Uncle William’s quail farm at Lim Chu Kang, it was a pity that the sambal lacked fragrance and sweetness to complement the prawns and eggs. All I could taste was the one-dimensional sauce that needed more bold flavours. At least, the rich taste from the higher yolk to white ratio of the quail eggs stole the show for me.
They have teamed up to offer freshly laid quail eggs from Uncle William\'s quail farm! \n<br />I really loved the combination of the potato salad with the quail eggs! Not to mention quail eggs have no bad cholesterol! \n<br />Enjoy your lunch with eggcitingg quail stories and egg-ducational talks with Uncle William!
Previewed the Buffet Egg-Xperience tonight at STREET 50 Restaurant &amp; Bar with dishes made using N&amp;N Farm\'s pasteurised fresh eggs.

STREET 50 is offering their signature Tandoori roasted turkey breast as part of their upcoming Bejeweled Christmas by the Bay Buffet Dinner during this festive season, served with either tangy pineapple salsa sauce or refreshing healthy cucumber coriander sauce.
Not in the best mood today, because I am a sucker when it comes to personal relationships. While friends matter a lot to me, I do expect mutual basic respect. \n<br />i don\'t know at the end of the day who can you really call as \'real friends\', the ones who \'talk only\' vs those who really show by actions, I am still contented to have a good bunch of friends whom I can rely on. \n<br />At the end of the day i think, what comes around goes around. \n<br />Thank you my BFF for the impromtu meet up!
Eat lots of turkey of course!!! Street 50 offers thick slabs of Turkey Breast as part of their Christmas buffet, making it so much healthier that you can definitely get more servings of it without all that guilt 😹 \n<br />Other delicious offerings are the Moist Smoked Oyster &amp; Crab Cakes or the succulent Bay Scallops with warm Tomato Essence. \n<br />This was a hosted meal courtesy of @street50sg, thank you for the warm hospitality and @aloysiusnoo for the invite!
Yes you hear me right, gingko nuts! \n<br />The soft and chewy gingko nut is renowned for its health benefits, but it has to be eaten in limited quantities so as not to cause any backfire from its benefits. If you are feeling lazy, you will be glad to know that they conscientiously slit the crab claw to aid your convenience in pulling out the meat! \n<br />Immersed in the rich black pepper sauce, crab lovers will definitely find yourself refilling this item as it is way too easy to crack it apart!\n<br />So what are you waiting for? Make your reservation with them now at 6818 6681 and you can even get a chance to win GOLDHEART diamond jewellery set worth over $2000!\n<br />Find out mora from the link in my profile!

We kicked off the dinner with dazzling appetizers like Salmon Carpaccio with Coriander &amp; Pinenut Vinaigrette. \n<br />The fresh and thinly sliced salmon was drizzled with the refreshing vinaigrette dressing, a bold taste yet not overpowering. A great dish to enhance your appetite for the buffet spread!\n<br />Thank you @street50sg and @aloysiusnoo for the hosted meal! \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!

Go easy on the buts though as an average human cannot consume more than 9 ginko nuts a day! •\n<br />We tasted a few delectable seafood dishes during our tasting at STREET 50 Restaurant &amp; Bar for their Bejewelled Christmas by the Bay Buffet Dinner yesterday and had great fun chatting with awesome foodie IGers. I MUST MUST MUST say that I enjoyed the {Smoked Oyster &amp; Crab Cake} most besides this dish as the smoked oyster taste in it was rather subtle and you literally can taste the fullness of the crab meat in the lightly crisp batter served with spicy Sambal Papaya sauce! 😋😋\n<br />•\n<br />{BEJEWELLED XMAS BY THE BAY BUFFET DINNER} will be on:\n<br />24 &amp; 31 Dec: $68++/adult, $32++/child\n<br />25&amp;26Dec &amp; 1&amp;2Jan: $58++/adult, $28++/child\n<br />Call 6818 6681 to make your reservations early! •\n<br />Hosted meal c/o @Street50Sg, many thanks to @aloysiousnoo for the invitation ✨\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#AldoraEats #AlAdverts
I love the flavours of the crab cake with smoked oysters in it  which burst in my mouth after I bite through its lightly battered crispy envelope. Served with their tangy sambal papaya sauce that paired so well with the crab cake! Luckily this is a buffet style, I can whack as many as I want! Interesting yet addictive!

[NEW Menu] [Harbourfront] [Launch: 10 Jul 2015] In conjunction with #SG50, Street 50 at Bay Hotel had launched an all [NEW] Golden Jubilee a la carte menu featuring cuisines with a local touch. My Durians! My 榴莲莲莲 ah!
No matter how hot the weather is, I just can\'t resist fried food.🙊 Moreover only $14.90 for such a generous portion and it\'s in a hotel! 👍🏻 Where? @Street50sg located at Bay Hotel! #dontsayibojio 😉
BuBur Cha Cha (SGD 9.90++) - So Chio, so pretty, how to resist? Get cracking (I mean on the caramelised sugar), because this sweet dessert will bring us sweet dreams!
This is the Otah by The Bay ($8.90) from @street50sg with oodles and oodles of seafood! Manila clams, Hokkaido scallops, huge octopus pieces and garoupa - SO MUCH SEAFOOD THAT THEY ARE FALLING OFF THE PLATE. \n<br />SO MUCH SEAFOOD, SHIOKKK! 😍 I am feeling so shellfish right now.
Here\'s Bubur Chacha creme brûlée $9.90, taste even better than it sounds. Unique combination topped w a layer of caramelized sugar, key characteristic of creme brûlée.🍮 |\n<br />Good news as you can ENJOY this as a complimentary dish. Simply flash this post or quote \"jacqsowhat\" to get this awesome dessert for FREE with 3 other diners - at least 3 main courses ordered. Redemption is available from now till 31st Aug 2015. Night owls shall rejoice as this place opens till 4am daily at Bay Hotel. 🎉 #STREET50 #STREET50sg

Unlike your usual, this is filled wholesome goodness like the clams and quail eggs. Best part yet, @street50sg is conveniently situated in Bay Hotel and operates from 6am-4am. Whose in for supper? 🙋🏻 
\nEssentially what you get if bubur cha cha wasn\'t thick and gooey in a bowl but instead vigorously beaten, whisked and boiled into a lightly starchy cream, and then buried alive under a crackly caramelized sugar bed weighed down with the standard bubur cha cha toppings. 3.8/5
Located at Bay Hotel, this is a good example of how luxury is never a costly affair at STREET50 - everything is priced below 20 bucks. Here\'s Satay Bay-hoon $14.90, cooked up w lots of ingredients and capped w a delectable satay sauce. \n<br />This could be your ideal supper place because it\'s open from 6am - 4am. Yes AM. 😎 #STREET50sg
Fragrant and delectable satay sauce, generous portion and fresh seafood.. What more can I ask for? \n<br />And to all my followers, flash this post and you can enjoy this dish for free with three other paying guests (4 people dining). Valid till 31st Aug 2015. And good news to all the night owls, this place opens to 4am daily.
We make a life by what we give.\" Sometimes, it\'s not about how much or what we do to help, but simply by the fact that we help others without condition. And sometimes, those who have less actually give more. \n<br />Thought for the day :) #thoughtfortheday #GiveUnconditionally #HelpOthers #sgfood #foodporn #fishandchips #burpple
Started off with one of the appetizers, Otah by the Bay ($8.90) which was topped with clams, octopus, scallops and garoupa. For the price, I must say that it was so worth it!
This restaurant should be featured more! The pictures on its menu look so good that we couldn\'t resist giving it a try though we were not hungry. With slipper lobster and clams, the laksa gravy is flavorful and we couldn\'t stop eating! Will be back for more!
The gravy is so creamy and tasty that we savored every drop!
Considerably small buffet table, but substantial enough given the reasonable buffet price. We paid S$20 per adult with a Groupon promotion - spread\'s not too bad (Thai red ruby iced dessert was good), just don\'t expect fine dining quality. Top up another S$8 for free-flow coffee/tea (quite pricey in my opinion).
Succulent lobster slicked in a sticky, sweet, salty and peppery sauce! 
My escargots are on fire!

For this dish of Oyster Char Kway Teow ($12.90), Chef Kelvin has tweaked his recipe by using wok-fried flat rice noodles (used commonly in hor fun) and fresh oysters instead of the usual thin ricecake strips and blood cockles. For people who are unable to take fresh oysters, fret not as Chef Kelvin has wok fry it to remove the smell. With the addition of those huge chunks of prawns, some kai lan vegetables and mushroom, and hint of Chinese wine, this plate of char kway teow packs a premium punch at a wallet-friendly price.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @street50sg for the hosting and @aloysiusnoo &amp; @cqstargrace for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Street 50 Restaurant &amp; Bar\n<br />Address: 50, Telok Blangah Road, Bay Hotel Singapore, Singapore 098828 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #street50sg #noodles

A lot of people has to avoid their favourite food! Eggs are also one of the many food items that we often eat in uncooked form. Half boiled eggs? Soft boiled eggs?  Wow all my favorite! . .\n<br />Now I learn something interesting during the Buffet sneak preview at @street50sg ! Pasteurized Eggs from N&amp;N farm! Pasteurization can actually kill salmonella or bird flu virus which may be present inside or outside the eggs. When u keep them in the Chiller, the eggs can be even kept up to 60 days!  When cracked open, it look a bit cloudy but it is actually normal. Interesting.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />What\'s up for Easter Weekend in @bayhotelsingapore?

Braised Tofu with Crab Meat and Egg white. A light simple dish that reminds me of home cooked food. Good for people who enjoy light flavor dishes. Think will go well with white rice. Thanks to @vetleow who kindly offer to hold the spoon for me!  Sorry that I didn\'t managed to catch a good shot of the dish. Too challenging as there isn\'t much colors for me to play with.

Prices start from $58++ for an adult diner and $28++ for a child diner. This was a tasting of the Christmas menu hosted by @street50sg and many thanks to @aloysiusnoo for the invite.

Bubur chacha creme brulee with gula melaka. Tasted so much like the traditional bubur chacha ....yes with coconut milk as well. Sweetness could be toned down a teeny weeny bit &amp; more flambed to have that extra crispy top then it will be perfecto😄😄 #buburchacha #singaporefood #dessert #sgfoodie #sg50 #foodporn #burpple #openricesg #nomnom #instafood @street50sg #tfjsg50
