Another try at the cakes from SunRay:) Earl grey infused cake with swiss meringue buttercream. Warning: the buttercream can be somewhat creamy and taste fattening. If you like sweet and fat, go ahead daredevil. 
With the rain that comes every now and then, we get ourselves the photo worthy choice - the rainbow cake! With cream cheese frosting inserted between it\'s colored layers, it deserves a good shot after all! Safe choice but not the best choice, the taste of rainbow cakes never wowed me so still searching for the one that tastes as good as it looks. Sun ray cafe serves good food too (Hints: Prawn aglio olio) and coffee which the beans they roast their own. Oh and it\'s pet friendly too🐶🐱
Doggy friendly cafe with excellent food!
2 fried dory fish, truffle fries and wasabi mayo
Look at that egg!
Coffee recommended to those who like it bitter but fragrant. Was informed that the beans was roasted on site in small batches.
Somewhere along Serangoon Gardens Way, a dog-friendly cafe. The food is nothing to wow about. Just somewhere you can chill for from the scorching heat
Venturing further away to a pets-friendly cafe at Serangoon. Coffee, cake and brunch makes a perfect weekend.
A few slices of Parmesan on top of a tower of baby roots. Healthy pyramid!
Spinach tagliatelle with shallots, cherry tomatoes and mushroom. Yummy! I like such infused pasta, always tasty and more interesting. This pasta is a little bit tougher.
Goat cheese with a unique array of baby root vegetables; baby beetroot, baby purple carrot, holland cherry tomato, baby turnip. Tastes so good!
Turf and turf. A choice of two meats (beef/lamb/pork) i chose lamb and beef. The lamb was good, tender and didn\'t have that really strong lamb smell. Served with wedges which i switch for potato gratin with my dad. $30plus. A good portion for sharing. #food #sgig #sg #dinner #petfriendly
The cafe was filled with lots of laughter &amp; friendly dogs. This place makes me happy :)
The chef specially prepared this for me. Acquired taste and interesting fashion. There\'s a generous portion of pasta and every mouth is refreshing and spicy. This is a vegetarian dish with main ingredients being tomato and lemongrass.
Served chilled. This soup is healthy and delicious. The blend is creamless, but feels creamy because the avocado gives it more volume. This is the kind of soup I want to have everyday.
Two decent pieces of dory battered with Asahi beer served on top of a bed of truffle fries with a portion of mixed greens by the side. This is crispy but creamy on the inside. Perfectly fried and very smooth. I must boast that it beats Fish &amp; Co. flat. This makes places like Manhattan Fish Market seem pathetic, because its not even their signature dish. But, this is a definite Must Try.
Long-standing stall run by an elderly uncle. Fresh crisp battered fish with thick potent lor mee gravy. Closes early!
Leafy green served with avocados and cherry tomatoes. The walnut sauce &amp; balsamic vinegar are wonderful mixed together for a delicate sweet zesty dressing.
Perk up salmon fillers with crunchy black &amp; white sesame topping. The sweet taro mash adds an amazing bites. Simple yet impressive!

Very nice!!!
Lovely crafted yu sheng with tasteful combination of veggie, pemelo pulps, smoked salmon, croutons and sweet tangy plum sauce.
Creamy with a velvety finish, a robust flavor that you to love. Loves to bits.
The red wine and rosemary make a delicious complement to seared steak. The sauce is full and flavourful. A medium rare will be desired!
