Char Siew Dumpling Tomato 🍅 Noodle 水饺番茄面 (S$5.50)\n<br />Available at @WongKeeWantonNoodle stall in Timbre+ by @TimbreMusic\n<br />First taste felt that the noodle was overpowered by the sour tomato 🍅 \'s taste. Took sometime to get used to it.\n<br />|\n<br />Wong Kee Wanton Noodle \n<br />Address 🏠 : 73A Ayer Rajah Cresecent, JTC LaunchPad @ One-North, # 01-06 Timbre+, Singapore 🇸🇬 139 957\n<br />Tel ☎️ : 9653 4819\n<br />Open 💈 : Mon - Fri : 8am - 6pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : One North (CC23)
Noodles that were infused with spinach. Beef brisket that were stewed for long hours. Homemade sambal chilli which will bind every component together.\n<br />⛰\n<br />Not many likes spinach but this taste no different from normal egg noodle. Noodles was aldente and more importantly had that springy texture. Brisket was extremely tender that it just disintegrates in your mouth. Being someone who loves very spicy, the sambal chilli to me was mild. The sauce could do with less sodium. ⛰\n<br />Facts to know. Spinach is low in calories and fats. Rich in iron. Contains potassium, manganese, magnesium and zinc and is a good source of omega 3 fatty acids. \n<br />#lunch #spinach #hungrygowhere #burpple #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodstagram #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #eatbooksg #eatliststar #singaporeeats #instafoodsg #instafollow #topfoodnews #citynomads

I know I do... spinach noodles with all the works, fried wanton, char siu and beef brisket to kick off today\'s festivities.  Stay tuned for some groundbreaking news in a couple of hours
Yes, I timed). Please don\'t be a grouch while you wait because you know you want to lay your hands on this plate of goodness, that\'s why you even joined the queue in the first place
The tomato noodles was quite smooth as well, though not as satiny as the spinach one; there was a slight touch of zest to it and it was nice - as though I\'ve ordered wanton noodles with tomato sauce (an old-school delight). Char Siew was well-roasted with a nearly-charred exterior, the way I like it - lots of tender lean meat and very little fats.
The spinach noodles were utterly smooth and literally glided through the palate; flavour was very mild despite the intense color. The beef brisket were moistened and rather succulent - but not as melty as I was hoping they would be. Portion was good and the entire dish was enjoyable.
Chock full of meat mixture, chopped prawns and crispy water chestnut for texture; these are one of the better dumplings I\'ve tasted in a long while
Prefer the other signature which is the beef brisket spinach noodle. #noodles #noodlelover #wantonmee #hungrygowhere #i8mondays #8dayseat #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggersg #igsg #igers #singaporeinsiders

@wongkeewantonnoodle, you\'ve won my heart 😍😍😍// Instead of the usual soya sauce mixture,  noodles are tossed in a  tomato gravy scented with Ginger.  I inhaled every strand with audible sighs. So worth the queuing time!
BEST Thing I\'ve put in my mouth since dining in and about my workplace One-North
