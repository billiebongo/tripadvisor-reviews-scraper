Your regular spicy concoction of what constitutes curry noodles. Noodles swimming in a pool of medium spiciness, joined by the typical ingredients of tau kwa, egg and meat. You can imagine the calories without me saying. Share the meal, share the calories!
There\'s something so(ul) satisfying about IKEA food hahaha. (Almost lost my phone today. It fell out of my pocket while I was trying out this reclining chair LOL HENG NOBODY ELSE TRIED THE CHAIR IN THE 5 MINS MY PHONE WAS LYING THERE)
Rice is rather clumpy. Affordably priced, I suppose, but better to get your fix at a hawker instead. Their chicken wings are pretty good, though!
I found Vegetable Meatball is nicer than the beef meatball. Enough just with Meatball &amp; Chicken Wings
Has went to IKEA for two consecutive days as want to eat their cold prawn. Like the systemic way of queuing, taking, paying and serving our own food. Will be back soon. 
Pasta with cheese and meatballs! Their meatballs are scrumptious and delicious! (SGD7.90) They taste SO MUCH BETTER than Pizza Hut\'s meatballs and they are also cheaper. The cinnamon roll contains cinnamon and sugar. 
I have been craving for this since months ago, but my procrastination killed me. Gotten my craving fulfilled last night over @ IKEA Alexandra. Honestly the Nasi Lemak they serve, it\'s a legit one 👍🏽
Look at the amt of tuna spread on top, so good OMG! Pair this with a cup of coffee or tea and you\'re good to go☺️☺️
Love IKEA\'s glutinous rice dumpling! So soft, and nicely wrapped in a lotus leaf. My favourite style! Do you know when they sell dumplings and when they don\'t? Last time I visited looking for it but they were not selling! 
We can\'t put the Singapore flag on Bak Chor Mee, Singapore Chilli Crab, Pepper Bak Kut Teh right? Coz there are rules for using the flag.
It\'s an ok dish but value for money as they serve you quite a bit more beef than elsewhere. 
admit it, everyone who visits will definitely get one of these for themselves! Its good and cheap! whats more to expect, especially when it is soft served icecream (our little secret: soft serves are water based hence less fattening than the cream based ones) so its okay to allow ourselves to indulge in these little happiness once in a while 😍
Chicken wings (still think they have one of the best), nasi biryani, fish &amp; chips and apple pie. Even though it\'s past lunch time, the place is crowded.
Am I the only one who goes to Ikea for food hehe tried the sotong rings this time and if was yum!! 
Turkey Shank at Ikea 💪. Had this last week before our colleagues outing. Couldn\'t resist after seeing everyone carrying this to their tables. Massive glazed turkey shank for under $10! Wasn\'t too fond of the accompanying beetroot(? I think). Turkey should always be served with cranberry!!! #IkeaSG #Turkey
ikea ice cream!! cheap and decent hehe better than a certain fast food chain + their cone is not the cardboard type :-)
Simple and awesomely filling meal... its priced moderately affordable.
Love the automated ice cream machines! You should try it if you haven\'t!
I like the flora icing that compliments the light vanilla cake. My fav ikea dessert. 
Look at the chicken wings and the meat ball. Sumptuous! Really don\'t know how to resist it! It goes well, or perhaps it goes BEST with the cherry jam and mushroom sauce. 👍
Chicken cordon bleu temporary available
This is only my second time to eat at IKEA but I think the Swedish meatballs will always be in my order every time I visit ... and YES 1 plan to visit as often as l can,😁😁😁\' I also like their creamy and \"buttery\" cheesecake.
Simple, fast, value for money ($0.50) and most important of all, DELICIOUS! Don\'t belittle this little dessert over here.. It\'ll got me craving for it often ever since the first try. 🍦👍 
My diet for a meal = your 3 meal. Input more than output. #fatdieme
First time having IKEA\'s breakfast. So @leowyq ordered everything on the menu. 😂
Breakfast earlier on! Told the boy to order a some meatballs &amp; chicken wings, he came back with a spread. 😱 \n<br />And it\'s so crowded at 10am! Free Mee Siam was fully redeemed also. \n<br />➊ [Mushroom Soup S$3] \n<br />➋ [Coffee S$0.50]
20 meatballs and counting calories.
chocolate &amp; butterscotch cake
chicken wings
elderflower cupcake
swedish meatballs

baked chicken leg with fries
#tea time at #ikea. With @hohumzz Yumz!! Recommended the cheese cake in the restaurant.
Yesterday\'s poached salmon with chives sauce, served with potato medallion &amp; mixed vegetables.
Pretty little pink marzipan cake. Never knew what hid inside these little morsels. This one has loads of whipped cream, a thin layer of strawberry jam and sponge cake. And it\'s so so so sweet!
If you don\'t like their meatballs then this maybe something you prefer. Thick ring of seafood covered with thin bread crust. Yummy. 
2 huge sausages with mashed potato on the side. Big serving, but the gravy is very peppery and salty.
Never knew IKEA had such pretty desserts! Taste wise this Montreux Tiramisu didn\'t really do it for me. Not even sure if alcohol was used. The cake itself was moist and the cream was slightly sweet. However I shouldn\'t be complaining about a pretty dessert that costs only $3.80, or should I?
The midsummer elderflower cupcake from IKEA that I have been longing to try. This $1.50 cake is a tiny morsel compared to cupcakes out there. The cake is made of plain sponge cake but the elderflower cream on top blows me away! Special floral taste that is hard to pin down but very refreshing and exotic.
Could hardly believe my eyes when I saw it on the menu! $6 for a person\'s share. A tad too oily. 
Love their brown sauce! I\'ll use my steak to wipe up every single drop!
Comfort food after badminton with @serepiphany @sikengisgiggs &amp; @jumbosale. Every weekend should be this awesome!
For those who\'d given up on IKEA\'s meatballs(like me) since their standard went down months ago, I say go and give it another try! Though they don\'t look as good as before, I think taste and texture-wise it\'s improved :) #ikea
20 meatballs. I will be so stuffed! I miss the previous recipe...
Gravad lax. Yummy smoked salmon. With lots of sweet mustard. Oooohhh.. Half price ends today. I had 2 plates! Satisfied now!
Lunch at @ikeasingapore Alexandra \n<br />Swedish Meatballs with Soup of the Day (S$9.90/ IKEA FAMILY price)\n<br />15 pieces of KOTTBULLAR meatballs came loaded with mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam, and ALLEMANSRATTEN, a gravy-like cream sauce.\n<br />The meatballs were nice as usual but the mash was too starchy. Can’t taste any potato 🥔 in it.\n<br />Cheese mousse with lingonberry filling &amp; almonds (S$3)\n<br />With digestive biscuit base. Not too sweet or sour.\n<br />Accompanied with coffee ☕️ which was free for IKEA FAMILY member.\n<br />.\n<br />IKEA\n<br />Address 🏠 : 317 Alexandra Road, level 2 IKEA Alexandra, Singapore 🇸🇬 159 965\n<br />Open 💈 : \n<br />Breakfast : 9am - 10.30am\n<br />Sun - Thu : 9am - 10pm\n<br />Fri - Sat, Eve of PH : 9am - 10.30pm\n<br />Tel ☎️ : 6786 6868\n<br />Website 🌐 : http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/food-at-ikea/ikea-restaurant \n<br />MRT 🚇 : Redhill (EW18)\n<br />Note 📝 : Take bus 🚌 service 33 across the MRT station

New! IKEA Food: \"Fish &amp; chip\" @Ikea Alexandra  🐟🍟\n<br />*****\n<br />Try Ikea food new item \"Fish &amp; chip\" (Member price: $4.90). We concur that this is one of the cheap &amp; tasty mains we had so far at IKEA (tried fish lasagna &amp; lotus rice before) but this fish &amp; chips set wins!! The combination of crispy texture batter with moist fish is so delish. The fries are not oily and the white sauce &amp; lemon elevate the dish well. 🍋\n<br />. \n<br />We finish the mains with their blueberry Cheesecake $3.5 (surprisingly delicious!)  Note that the restaurant is closed for public on 18th August for the \"Crayfish Party\"(ticket on sale)👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\n<br />.\n<br />The whole IKEA store is on sale between 9-27 Aug (include their little supermarket) &amp;Check out our pics for their interesting promo!! 🤑\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />📍IKEA Alexandra \n<br />317 Alexandra Road S159965\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />. \n<br />#ikea #sale #promo #august #fishandchips #summersale #ikeasingapore #ikeaalexandra
But at $4 a set, I am not complaining! Didn\'t have the chicken wings because diet.
Other than the hotdog and meatballs, you must not miss the chicken wings right or not~~~lol...🤣\n<br />- Chicken Chop🍗\n<br />- Chicken Wings🍖\n<br />- Black Coffee☕️
I love it! Fresh chicken breast coated with a thin crunchy batter -- very old school. Reminded me of the chicken tenders KFC used to sell, only that KFC\'s batter was not as substantial. Extremely addictive 🍗
All these cost merely $30 only and free flow drinks inclusive at $0.5 for hot drink,$1.5 for cold drinks. 😌😌\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #cafe #ikea #ikeasg #salmon #chickenbiryani #asianfood #foodpornography #localfoodsg #localdelights #foodiesg #foodporn #sgfood #yongthefoodmonster #yummyinmytummy #eatstagram #eattolive #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodblog #sgfoodporn #sgfoodhunt #sgfooddirectory #sgfooddaily #sgfooddiary #instafoodsg #instadaily #sgeats

Had to pay by cash because was told that my Ikea card has expired as I have not used it for two years. Mood spoiled! How ridiculous when the last time I used the card was in Feb this year. Thankfully, I still have the receipts as proof. It\'s not funny, IKEA, I still have about $30 in the card. #luckyihaventthrowthereceipt #stillwaitingforareply #ikeasg #sgig #igsg #instasg #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #instafood #burpple #burppleSG #openricesg #8dayseat #iweekly #fatclayfood #swweats #foodphotography #foodstagram

Lunch with Karen after our errands. \n<br />From left: complimentary coffee and tea (U.P.: $.0.50 each), courtesy of Karen\'s membership card. \n<br />Her Nasi Lemak (S$4) is the dish of the day - kinda worth it for the variety of condiments but wasn\'t outstanding. \n<br />My salmon with long beans, drowned in Hollandaise sauce (S$9.90) -  everything\'s boiled and tasted pretty healthy (well, maybe not for the sauce). Works well for me. \n<br />Kid\'s meal (meatballs) (S$3) - not only does it satisfy my craving for meatballs, but it\'s in small portion (5 meatballs) which is good for me who wants a little of everything! Lol.
The strawberry jam 🙌
Cinnamon swirl and coffee for just $1 nett! Pastry was thick and fluffy with generous amount of cinnamon coating the interior. Perfect snack to have anytime of the day 👍🏼 No wonder the IKEA food hall is constantly packed with people all day, everyday. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #coffee
Many varieties and yummy food at ikea. 
Felt so #cute that got to self-service with #pushingcarts #trolley to pick up own food .. fried #dumplings taste quite meaty n nice. Their #chickenwings ofcos always nicest. Bbq ribs ($9+) and smoked salmon ($6+) were affordable and quite decent. #Dessert was well done! #fun to eat when u end up at #ikeasg .. #sgfood #burpple
Haven\'t eaten in ikea for a while. Queues long as ever. There is now an additional sides made of potatoes (I think) which is really nice. Better than the salmon actually....haha
