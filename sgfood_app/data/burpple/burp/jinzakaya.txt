...but it\'s just good business. Don\'t let my witty opener deter you from this sumptuous serving of gindara yaki, a.k.a. marinated codfish, as it\'s really not fishy at all. The seductively smoky scent and flavor from the charcoal grill eliminates any funky fishiness, ensuring a topnotch slice of the sea.
Aesthetically served inside the shiso leaf, the gindara was grilled into perfection. The flesh was silky smooth yet still retained its moisture and oil, with a nice hint of smokiness (especially from the charred skin). It was served with teriyaki sauce though I prefer having it without any sauce to fully enjoy the exquisite flavour and freshness of the gindara.
Hand-held over charcoal, this was a display of chef\'s masterful fire control. The result was a skin that crackles delightfully, while bringing out the smoothness and succulence of the omega 3-rich cod. Be sure to pair it with the lip-smacking teriyaki tare sauce on the side; its savoury-sweetness the perfect complement to the oily fish.
JINzakaya\'s gyozas are JIN shiok, believe me. Priced very reasonably at $10 for a half dozen of these plumptious beauties (yeah, it sounds a lot better when Nigella Lawson says it), there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn\'t order a plate of these glorious gyozas.
...but meat on sticks gives life to all the flesh. Here at JINzakaya, charcoal grilled meat skewers take rightful pride of place on their lineup. Although meat isn\'t the only thing they stick on a, well, stick, it\'s undoubtedly the best thing they offer.
With a pretty huge array of skewers, it might be difficult for you to decide on your favourite here. I enjoyed their green peppers and foie gras a lot, while the pork belly skewers might be a tad tough for my teeth. The anything-wrapped-in-bacon were definitely popular among us especially those with sweet cherry tomatoes. Do yourself a favour by getting some sake to go with these skewers!
Can\'t get enough of them skewers? The newly expanded kushi (charcoal-grilled skewers) selection featuring foie gras, amberjack, scallops, oysters, beef short ribs and more is reason enough to go overboard!
Initially thought this was merely tofu served with goma sauce, but then again, why would JINzakaya serve something so plebeian and then charge $5 for it? Ground sesame seeds were incorporated into the tofu itself, and also made into a puree-like sauce. I like the element of surprise here ‚Äì the roasted goodness assaulting the tastebuds as you dig into the chilled creamy tofu.
So that you can ogle at the glistening trio of beef in full glory. Bottom up: Ox tongue ($8), Angus beef ($10), and Short rib ($10), topped with black pepper, yuzukosho, and togarashi respectively. These juicy, flavourful morsels are proof that good things do come in small packages, or portions, in this case.
This was really mind-blowing for me. I\'m really hard to please by tomatoes, but this unassuming huge de-skinned tomato just brought me to another level of happiness. Really sweet and juicy and it was soaked in vinegar and lots of onions, which helped to elevate the flavour even further.
Not sure where to begin from the seven-page menu at JINzakaya? I\'d recommend the refreshing Marugoto Tomato, which literally translates to \'whole tomato\'. Famed for its intense sweetness, the momotaro tomato is blanched to enhance those qualities, and served deskinned, highlighting its soft, juicy flesh. Goes very well with a fragrant sake like the Midnight Blue Yamamoto and Miyakanbai, both of which are from the seasonal, curated selection.
Definitely don\'t recall them having the Raindrop Mochi in their dessert menu and decided to go straight for it (there is also a Fried Matcha Ice-Cream too!).
Wanted to visit initially for the Ebi Ten Donburi but I looked through the menu and thought I could do with something more comforting ‚Äî ended up switching it up to this Buta Shoga Yaki Donburi which was pretty much a great decision.
ÔøΩ\n<br /> The grilled chicken added an char-ness to the broth. Sadly the sous vide egg diluted the broth. Need some improvement.
Had it a few times, and it remains my favorite dish of the place. The broth is rounded with sweetness, while every bite of the kimchi releases the sour punch. Order a few yakimono sticks to complete your meal.
|\n<br />Best dish of the night. The intense heat from the scorching charcoal cameralized the surface. It had almost zero resistance with my teeth. The only missing thing was the natural saltiness from the squid (which is very hard to achieve).
|\n<br />Clean, sliced, braised then skewed. All for this plate of offal delight.\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />However, this place is missing their own in-house speciality sauce.
|\n<br />Lightly floured tiny shrimp then deep fried till golden. A squeeze of lemon is all we need to complete this side dish.
|\n<br />Tasted surprisingly familiar like the Chinese raw fish dish. Failed to portray the oiliness of the salmon.
|
|\n<br />Available during their promo lunch. For a healthy version, a hearty bowl of salad topped with sliced pork. This picture did no justice to its size. The generous amount of Japanese sesame sauce helped to remove any unwanted porky smell. Not a bad choice to kickstart our dinner.
No carb diet doesn\'t mean you should skip JINzakaya! Besides their delicious ramen, check out their salad bowls. üòç
JINzakaya\'s rendition still retains the subtle sourish and mild spicy kimchi flavour but unlike the Korean ones, there is absence of the fermented smell and taste which played out well IMO. As expected, the rich white chicken broth was absolutely delightful üòç but kimchi taste lacked the punch.
Oh that rich and flavourful broth was so slurppy delicious! üòç No wonder it takes JINzakaya 8-12 hours to achieve such thick yet clean white chicken brothüëç. 
:\n<br />JINzakaya is located at the remote Connexion Farrer Park, right beside its sister restaurant Sushi Jin, both under the acclaimed Les Amis group. The vibrant mural of old Japanese posters and the big open kitchen (shared with Sushi Jin) sets the casual vibe for a nightcap with friends.\n<br />:\n<br />Though numerous sticks were cleaned out and accumulated in the disposal cups, the memorable dishes IMO were the grilled squid or Ika Sugata, and Kimchi Ramen. The white chicken broth was velvety and had an adequate touch of the kimchi tang, with honeyed grilled chicken to complement this slurpy bowl.\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the tasting invite, and @jinzakaya for hosting us #BurppleTastemakers! #Burpple
Fresh Handmade Gyoza - pan-fried till crisped with a bit of chewiness without being too greasy, stuffed with flavourful, juicy minced pork. Slightly pricey at $15 but these were pretty good to go with drinks!\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you #burpple for the invite and @jinzakaya for the warm hospitality!
@JINzakaya is your izakaya by night with solid food options. if skewers are not enough to fill your tummy, kimchi ramen ($12.80) to the rescue! really short of the kimchi spiciness i was looking for but in return an appetising mildly spiced hours-cooked chicken broth. chargrilled chicken thigh and an onsen egg by the side to spoil you further. then, you drink more sake.\n<br />.\n<br />a @burpple invite and hosted by @jinzakaya

Thick chicken broth, which the chef uses both pork &amp; chicken bones to cook it for 48hours, paired with the spicy &amp; slightly sour kimchi pasta &amp; topped with a ooze worthy onsen egg &amp; succulent char-grilled chicken thigh. The ramen was super q, which helped with the whole slurping motion. I can feel my belly going into a complete coma already! \n<br />P/S: for those working around Farrer Park, they have super worth it lunch sets going on!! If I were working around that area, I am bound to go there everyday! I kid you not. \n<br />Much thanks to @Burpple &amp; @jinzakaya for the love!
some hits and misses with the skewers but hey, we have sake!\n<br />.\n<br />a @burpple invite, hosted by the good folks of @JINzakaya
Located just beside One Farrer Hotel, JINzakaya is one of those hip places good for after-work drinking and delicious food to fill the stomach. Chit chatting, we soon ate our way though sticks of skewers and mains, slurping the warm ramen to sampling cups of sake. There was even a \"tense\" moment as we chose our sake cup cos we were told it shows a person\'s personality. Of course, it\'s not real! But you should had seen our faces...
Simple yet enjoyable appetizer of firm, crunchy herring roe without any fishiness, with a light tinge of spiciness, and refreshing cucumbers. (ft. hand model of the night @cassakating ü§ó) 
comes with generous amount of wafer thin sliced pork slathered in homemade sesame dressing to please the meat eater in you. think someone must had their maths wrong because how can this huge bowl be just $12.80!\n<br />.\n<br />a @burpple invite and hosted by @jinzakaya
üç¢üçñüç¢ I actually liked the ox\'s tongue! The huge range of food is great for night out with friends, where you can eat over the range of sake! Thank you @burpple and @jinzakaya for the invite! #Burpple #burpplesg #izakaya #jinzakaya
because lunch can be salad only and still be full like hell with a hearty bowl of jin shabu shabu buta at @jinzakaya. comes with generous amount of wafer thin sliced pork slathered in homemade sesame dressing to please the meat eater in you. think someone must had their maths wrong because how can this big bowl be just $12.80! \n<br />.\n<br />a @burpple invite and hosted by @jinzakaya
Always a sucker for pot stickers, these little babies hit the spot. Crisp on the outside, meaty on the inside, it\'s pretty much just good ol\' comfort food that you\'ll wanna alternate with a swig of beer. üçª
Although a tad salty, major ups for smokiness of the charcoal grilled chicken and runny egg. $12.80 with tea. Will return!
Looks like I haven\'t got over the ramen routine with the 2nd bowl of ramen in 2 days. The miso broth was normal, nothing to shout about. Definitely get kimchi and tan tan ramen over this. Those rich and bright flavors definitely suit my tastebuds much better.
Refreshing chilled ramen topped with generous flavorful ingredients like salmon roe, egg, crabmeat, cucumbers &amp; grilled chicken! Paired w their homemade chuka sauce, this dish is perfect for the hot summer when you\'re feeling for ramen but dread to commit to hot broth üçú‚òÄÔ∏è  
Featuring my cold ramen noodle dish here with grilled teriyaki chicken strips, fish roe, ikura, crab meat, shredded egg &amp; cucumber with homemade chuka dressing. Didn\'t like the chicken meat cos it was too hard and texture was weird but otherwise I loved how tangy this is. Cold noodles + fish roe combi is üëçüèº for me! Still prefer Sushi Jin lunch sets though but then again what you pay is what you get! #8dayseat #eatoutsg #burpple
The chicken soup base was pure and comforting! Both the Jin tori ramen and kimchi ramen were good, but I preferred the latter because it is spicy and more umami. Noodles had a good firmness to it. The chargrilled chicken thigh and onsen egg were also excellent! I think it\'s super worth it for $12.80++ considering what other ramen shops are charging. 
Located near Farrer Park MRT station, JINzakaya is a hip, new izakaya concept by the Les Amis group, and a more affordable alternative to its sister outlet, Sushi Jin. Sharing plates ‚Äî think Sushi Jin\'s famed skewers ‚Äî are the focus at dinner, but at lunch, the restaurant offers extremely value for money set lunches ($12.80 with a drink). Choose from 16 mains including rice bowls, sandwiches, ramens. Try the Kimchi Ramen or Jin Tori Ramen (the latter comes with shredded chargrilled chicken and an onsen egg) ‚Äî both feature a very flavourful chicken broth ‚Äî or go for one of the hearty salads like the Jin Tori Salad, which comes with homemade ginger dressing and moreish kawa ebi. To complete the meal, order a side dish like Fresh Handmade Gyoza ($15) or Ika Sugata ($15), whole grilled squid to share. Pro tip: There are only about 50 seats so make a reservation and come early, as the menu items run out quickly!
Out of the 16 options, my favourites were: \n<br />- Kimchi Ramen: Loved the tinge of smokiness from the char-grilled chicken that got infused into the broth!\n<br />- Jin Sakana Sando: Simple and straightforward; fish tasted fresh, and the thin layer of panko coating was crisp, sandwiched between the crusty ciabatta halves. Plus points for smearing just a little egg mayo sauce inside, and thoughtfully putting the rest on the plate so you can add as little/much as if you like. \n<br />- Jin Tori/Jin Shabu Shabu Salads: Very hearty portion for both salads, with fresh ingredients  and lovely sauces (ginger and goma &amp; peanut respectively). Like how the former had deep-fried river shrimps ‚Äî the same one from Sushi Jin! Alternatively, order it separately and share with your lunch buddies (Kawa Ebi, $12).
Huge sandwich! Fish katsu with delicious tartar sauce sandwiched by two large, puffy ciabatta. Really good and super filling. Was already very full after eating the first half. Didn\'t notice the fishy taste until after the meal.
Set lunch at $12.80++ that came with very good brown rice tea. Chicken yakitori was good - nicely grilled and tender. Rice was a bit bland to me, slightly better after I added the chilli furikake. Better off getting the ramen for a bigger portion of meat and deliciousness at the same price.
Whilst the salmon fillets had the seasoned competency of a 35-year-old Japanese professional, the same cannot be said for the drought-stricken rice, so arid that traversing camels are miserably falling on their sides to the ground. 3.2/5
I liked 75% of the components, the chicken was evenly marinated and quite tender, soup savoury-tasty without an overly strong inclusion of kimchi that would mask the base broth. \n<br />The weakest link was the limpy noodles (we commented as like instant noodles lah) which was perhaps not the type we preferred.
From Jinzakaya by the Les Amis group, affiliated with Sushi Jin which is situated next door. Their set lunch menu offers four different dishes from four categories; Rice, Noodle, Salad and Sandwich. Jin Special Onigiri Burger is a rice burger featuring grilled rice patties; a little bland without the black pepper sauce, but sticky with a little charred crispness over the top. Roast beef is thinly sliced, covered in a black pepper sauce flanked with caramalised onions; somewhat similar to a beef carpaccio with sweet and peppery flavour. Accompanying the burger at the side are some garden greens mixed with sesame dressing, which is definitely umami and all refreshing to the heavy-tasting and carb loaded burger.
From Jinzakaya by the Les Amis Restaurant which is affiliated to Sushi Jin next to them. The attractive lunch deals includes four selections within their salad, sandwich, rice and noodle menus with a cup of tea at $12.80. This is the fish sandwich, which was pretty light and refreshing in flavour but rather filling with its large portion. Ciabatta was chewy without feeling too dense, while the fried fish was lightly battered; crisp on the exterior and flaky inside, while flavoured with greens and a complimenting, light tasting Japanese tartar sauce that lifts the flavour of the sandwich overall. A pretty enjoyable sandwich despite its ordinary looks!
The dishes here are all really nice, but the Katsu Curry was probably the least special. Having tried the Ramen (both the Kimchi and the Jin Tori), I think those would be better choices. (Rating:üòÄ)
Very enjoyable! The kimchi broth is bright with sour notes and it\'s absolutely surprisingly delicious! Healthy servings of chicken. Makes the perfect choice for a power lunch. Vintage Japanese graphic art decor. Will be back again!
Some hits and misses, but overall can give a try. \n<br />Let me gather before I write the review..... After I finish grading my students journals. üò≠
after seeing the @burpple team\'s post about @jinzakaya, the newly opened sister restaurant of @sushijin_sg, i decided i had to check it out. for lunch, jinzakaya offers what they call a four x four lunch, essentially 4 categories of food (salads, rice, noodles and sandwiches) with 4 options per category all priced at $12.80 each.\n<br />yakimono skewers are also not served during lunch but only during dinner. it felt really strange visiting an izakaya and not having yakimono skewers but then again, jinzakaya isn‚Äôt supposed to be your typical izakaya. \n<br />i got to try the kimchi ramen and the jin yakitori don. the kimchi ramen came with an onsen egg, slices of chargrilled chicken thigh meat and springy ramen noodles. for the soup, kimchi paste was added to white chicken soup base, forming a combination which sets this bowl of noodles apart from the usual kimchi ramyun you find elsewhere. the chargrilled chicken thigh meat looked especially enticing but i felt it was a little too lightly seasoned hence resulting in a rather tasteless piece of meat, especially when contrasted with the soup. \n<br />similarly for the jin yakitori don, my friend and i came to a consensus that the yakitori sticks were too bland for our liking. given that the yakitori sticks are supposed to be the main accompaniment with each scoop of rice, i think the flavour of the meat is something that can be improved on. there was however no fault to be found with the onsen eggs in both the ramen and the yakitori don. \n<br />i‚Äôll probably end up trying the salads and sandwiches during my next visit as they\'ve gotten some pretty good reviews. for those intending to pay a visit, be sure to arrive early to avoid disappointment as some of their dishes run out real quick!
An awesome lineup, each was skillfully grilled over charcoal so expect some lightly charred edges and lovely grill marks. Juicy, moist  and wonderfully glistening, my bias would definitely be JINzakaya‚Äôs tender Gyu Karubi - Beef Short Rib ($10) off the newly expanded Kushi (charcoal-grilled skewers) menu. The Hotate - Scallop ($6) wrapped in bacon was really good too, the perfect marriage of textures and flavours. Sweet and savoury. And having the fragrance imparted from the grill, the meats have all their moisture locked in with just simple seasoning (cause it will be such a waste to use crazy spices or sauces) to enhance the experience. So tantalize your tastebuds and have a fun after-work drink with their more premium offerings of Angus Beef, melt-in-your-mouth Foie Gras and Amberjack. You will also find the usuals like chicken thigh, chicken skin, pork belly, quail egg, chicken cartilage as well as chicken and leeks which they execute remarkably.
We love the momotaro tomato ($8) so much we ordered like 5-6 times coz we couldn\'t stop. We think it\'s the sour plum powder sprinkled on top that makes the dish shine.... #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgig #igsg #instafoodsg #foodspotting #foodpornsg #foodiesg #insiderfood #burpple #8dayseat #sgeats #whati8today #instafod_sg #foodpornsg #igmasters #ig_asia #instasg #instagramsg #instagramers #igers #sgiger #japanesefood #sgfood \n<br />Jinzakaya \n<br />1 Farrer Park Station Road (off Rangoon Road)\n<br />#01-08/10 Singapore 217562\n<br />CONTACT: 6443 1173\n<br />OPENING HOURS\n<br />Open Daily\n<br />Lunch: 12.00pm - 2.30pm (last order 2.15pm)\n<br />Dinner: 6.30pm - 10.30pm (last order 10.15pm)

taste is ordinary.
|\n<br />Inhouse made dumpling and fried till crispy. Mixed your own ratio for vinegar and soy sauce for the max impact. Remember to drop a few droplet of chilli oil.
|\n<br />Personal favorite will be the enoki with bacon. The savory bacon fat melted into the enoki. As you chewed, the fat slowly dispatched and filled the entire palate. .\n<br />|\n<br />Compared to other Izakaya bar, Jinzakaya played a safer set of cards. Most of the Yakitori were wrapped with bacon which also resulted the lack of the distinct Izakaya character.
Highlight: the grilled chicken is superb!
Comes with grilled chicken and a perfect onsen egg! Slurp it all up and still in good time for a Sunday afternoon nap üò¥
Enjoyed this, the salmon was pretty well done!

Not exactly impressed with the onigiri, but the roasted beef and sauce could probably be a slight saving graceüò¨
