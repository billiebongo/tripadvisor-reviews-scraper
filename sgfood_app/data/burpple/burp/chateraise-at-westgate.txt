Sliced peaches and berries on Chateraise’s signature swiss roll.
Craving for something light, creamy and sweet after a meal? Head to Châteraisé for dainty treats that won\'t break the bank. You won\'t go wrong with the Double Fantasy Cream Puff ($1.90) — equal parts of light Hokkaido cream and velvety smooth custard packed in a chewy choux pastry. Each puff is individually packed, so it\'s easy enough to eat. Pro tip: Not a Westsider? Châteraisé has an outlet at Isetan Scotts supermarket — perfect for midday office snacking or to take (secretly) with you to the movies. 
Having tried quite a number of different Mille crepe cakes in Singapore, Chateraise\'s best seller White Zebra has a softer texture though the pastry cream is slightly sweeter and does not harden after being refrigerated. It also differs with its light sponge cake base and the price is an absolute steal ($4.70/slice).
Found this during the okinawa fair and it taste pretty average with the filling tasting like ice cream but the sweet potato flavour is very faint and light. The pastry can be further improved as it is dry and tough
My boy loves their cake rolls &amp; cream puffs whereas I am a fan of their millet crepe &amp; strawberry cakes. What about your picks at their outlet? #cuisineparadiseeatout #cakeporn #burpple
$2 cream puff! And has lips smacking good vream and custard cream, this small puff will surely make you go for another👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Yet another cream puff that comes stuffed with goodies; this one comes with smooth custard mousse and Hokkaido Cream. Could have been rather good if not for the slightly dry and bread-like puff pastry.
Filled with equal parts of light Hokkaido cream and velvety vanilla custard, this would have been perfect if not for that soft and chewy choux pastry. Regardless, I love how Japanese desserts like this are not overly sweet. 
Cloud-like sponge cake with rich yet light fresh cream and sweet strawberries makes for a perfect afternoon tea treat!
Happy Birthday, Julia Child! It would have been her 103rd birthday today.
Soft and airy sweet bouchée in strawberry &amp; cream cheese flavour 》$1.90

Panda Cream Roll + Matcha Latte = Happy #Breakfast!
Happy Little Bear ($4.70) from Chateraise Hokkaido at Isetan Westgate. Been seeing the bunny one around but when I got there they had the bear!
Was pretty much love at first sight seeing this in the display fridge because I love Mille Crepes. This one came with a sponge cake underneath. Loved the thick, torched layer of caramel that sits atop the top layer of the Mille Crepe which was rather strong. Vanilla pastry cream was also aromatic and light, spread in between each layer while the sponge below was light and fluffy. A great alternative version which is even less than half the price of the one from a particular New York patisserie, though the downside is you would have to find your own seats and your own fork.
And the best thing is, it\'s only $1.90! Quickly go grab!
Great variety of cakes available. Bought tjis one for $3.90 and I think it\'s okay as for the price itself. Don\'t judge its size! It might look small but after you eat it, it\'s actually quite filling. And the cake is really fluffy as its name suggested! Ratings 8/10
It is cheap and worth to give them a try. Their cake quite special compare with others. 
Featuring the Strawberry Milk Cake, the Legendary Strawberry Shortcake and also tried the Matcha Bombe.
A watch tells one, while the other is the love for desserts. Featuring a classic rose gold Glasgow watch from the unpretentious Daniel Wellington, where\'s all the love is now.

I still think BAKE does it better. What do you say?
Definitely a cake lover\'s dream come true!
So good and rich - only at @chateraise.singapore! 🤤
I also love the cookie bits on the matcha coating that gives a crunch in every bite. Soooo good that i\'ve to share! 💚💚\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple
I\'m no fan of cream but the fresh cream is so good, light and foamy, it kinda melts in your mouth. The sponge cake is so fluffy and soft I cannot get enough of it. Cutting another slice for afternoon tea! #Chateraise\n<br />#singaporeinsiders #exploringsingaporeeats #whati8today #love #yummy #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #onmytable #beautifulcuisines #burpple #sharefood #sgeat #exploresingapore
Cant remember the name of the cake, its a chocolate based sponge cake with cream in between, and coffee cream on the outer layer. Its only 3.90, and delicious! Especially when youre craving for cake

And oh boy, this was exceptionally good! Tasting so matcha-ly, the cake was soft and it wasn\'t overly sweet too. •\n<br />#burpple

Love how these cheese tarts have a crumbly exterior, fluffy inner texture and chessy warm soft filling..\n<br />•\n<br />Have you tried? \n<br />#burpple
The whole display draws you to the fridge as your eye wander from dessert to dessert. But the green tea roll that\'s one of their top desserts didn\'t impress me much. Their puffs (which I tried last round at Chinatown) was much better. 2/5
I\'m eyeing that matcha one 🌝🌝🌝 #matcha #抹茶 #cake #sgig #igsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #burpple #hungrygowhere #whati8today #singaporefood #singaporeinsiders #exploresingapore #beautifulcuisines #eeeeeats #instafood_sg #sgcafefood #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #topsgrestaurants
