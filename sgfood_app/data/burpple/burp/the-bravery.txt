I am purposely here for their lavender latte ,not as good as I thought ,but is good experience to try it out :)
Not much traffic when I was here on a Saturday late afternoon. Like the tranquil environment. Very good for conversations and reading. Had the lavender latte, which had a hint of sweetness that complemented the bitterness of the coffee. Not sure about the dried lavender bits though.
Warm fluffy pancake stacks drowning in maple syrup (!!!) &amp; topped with bananas, feta &amp; crushed pistachio is the go-to &amp; must have stack.
I was pleasantly surprised w this rendition! üíú The fragrant floral hint of lavender blended really well w the coffee &amp; doesn\'t at all overpower the taste of coffee. The cafe is chill &amp; cosy too. A great place for quiet conversations or to get some work done. 
Using beans from Allpress. The espresso was well extracted &amp; balanced. Low acidity, medium body &amp; berry sweet aftertaste. A delicious cup of espresso! I wouldn\'t mind downing 2 cups of diz! üçáüëÖüí¶
Just across from Jalan Besar Stadium is The Bravery, a no-frills cafe to pop by for your caffeine fix while working on the go. Its high ceilings, bare-bone tables and chairs give off a laid-back vibe, providing an idyllic escape from the city. Come with a good read on hand while sipping on the pretty-as-a-picture Lavender Latte ($5.50) ‚Äî balanced cup of java topped with lavender bits that imparts fragrance. It pairs well with a slice of S\'mores Tart ($7).
If food were the only criteria, they\'d have won my heart hands down. These crab cakes came piping hot, packed with lots - I mean loads - of sweet crab meat caked in crispy fluffy batter. They were well-seasoned, and served with a simple yet amazing salad and absolutely fab saut√©ed shrooms. Unfortunately, food\'s never the only criteria, and I simply can\'t understand why we waited 40 minutes for one dish when there was barely anyone else in the caf√©??
Latte with a hint of lavender... A cross between Perk-me-up and relaxation sleepiness?
The bagel was nicely toasted but I gotta say the dish was disappointing overall. The cream cheese that came along with it wasn\'t what I expected, it was grated cheese mixed with cream?! Also, the scrambled eggs were dry and meh. Definitely did not hit the bar this time! $14. 
Fancy a little me-time with your tea time? The rustic premises of The Bravery provide an idyllic escape from the urban hustle and bustle. The S\'more Pie is just nice for one, with sticky, melted s\'mores over a chocolately layer followed by a crumbly biscuit base. Pair it with the Lavender Latte! 
Another \"ok\' cafe. Don\'t expect too much from this cafe. \"ok\" food at some \"ulu\" place. \n<br />ordered cuppucino and ice chocolate. 2 eggs on toast. 1 with salmon another with turkey bacon. poached egg with not so runny yolk. Turkey bacon cold when served, salmon to salty. Toast a little bit too hard but crispy. But.. the Ice chocolate drink saved the whole meal.
Lavender Latte is alright. If you like pre-sweetened coffee I suppose it would work. But between the sugar, milk and lavender flavor... I couldn\'t taste the coffee much. I suppose that\'s not how I like my coffee, but it\'s a good, easy sort of drink tho. 
With bananas, ricotta cheese, syrup and crushed pistachio. One of the better pancakes I\'ve tried in Singapore. Fluffy, moist and buttery. Couldn\'t really taste the ricotta cheese in the batter though. 
I had the S\'mores tart and I enjoyed it from the very first bite to the last! üòã
Pancake Stack ($15). Essentially 3 fluffy as pillows and plump pancakes stacked atop each other, then sinfully drizzled with viscuous maple syrup, topped with bananas and slapped with a dollop of ricotta cheese. 
Still feeling sleepy after drinking 2 cups of kopi at one go. #immunetocaffeine
Am still hung up over how these beautiful amazeballs pancakes were hideously destroyed by the pretentious golden syrup. The pancakes are too delish - so I\'ve resolved to bringing my own maple syrup on my next visit.
Was always keen on trying what\'s touted as one of the \"best pancakes in Singapore\"; so it was a huge disappointment actually having it today. 
Lavender is the beautiful little touches. Yes, what a flowery morning.
Topped with bananas, ricotta cheese, honey and crushed pistachios, The Bravery has one of the best pancakes in Singapore
Conversations over eggs on toast, pancakes stack, and our favourite lavender lattes
Very unique and exclusive to Bravery (at least in SG). Very refreshing taste but personally feel that the taste of lavender is over-powering and so I can\'t really taste much of the coffee. Want to try something different? You should try this.
The stack comes with caramelized bananas, ricotta cheese, chopped pistachios and honey. Burppler Sabbie Lisa recommends sharing with a friend! #Burpple
Full of lavender frangrance! If you don\'t like lavender you may find it too overpowering. Nice combination! Worth a try!
Pancakes with honey, bananas and crushed pistachios. A sweet treat to brighten up your day. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
A cliche quote from Cinderella, for a not-too cliche rendition of Pancakes stack ($15). This item features sliced bananas, pistachios and ricotta cheese. However be warned that the overload of honey makes it extremely sinful! Give it a shot if you\'re in need of a sugar rush for that energy boost! 
Same old fluffy but the taste of the pancake itself is just so right to my tastebud. Priced at 15.00 by topping it with banana, ricotta cheese, crushed pistachios and honey.
Ideal meal to wake up to: 3 Pancakes with banana, ricotta cheese, chopped pistachios and maple syrup topped with a honeycomb that is of the right sweetness! Of course, the cup of latte is essential too üòâ
Topped up an additional $3 for the honeycomb, the honeycomb was of the right sweetness for me. However, i do wish the portion of it was slightly bigger üôä
Swear these pancakes are one of the best pancakes I\'ve ever eaten! The pancakes consists of 3 layers of fluffiness goodness, served w/ caramelised bananas, crushed pistachios, ricotta cheese and honeycomb! All for 15 SGD, which is really worth the price ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è 
With a good ambiance, The Bravery is a good place to chill at - especially on weekdays when there isn\'t much of a crowd. The English Breakfast tea is pretty well-bodied and as it should, comes with a small serving of milk which blends well with the tea.
Eggs with corned beef hash, tasty &amp; not just another eggs benedict. Great coffee too. 
Pancakes were so thick, fluffy and soft! My kind of pancake. Would have loved to have the maple syrup by the side and probably some drizzle on it, because the last stack was soaked in honey and this made it rather sweet. I would advise you to come on a really empty stomach because it very filling. Pair it with a cup of latte to wash away that sweetness
Latte was smooth and well balanced. With the added lavender, I must admit that it have that soapy smell and aftertaste. It was not too bad, but probably not something I would try again? I guess it\'s more for those with a unique palate. 
no bravery needed for that cup of flat white since it was the same folks who brought you the plain. but you do need some bravery to try finding that door if you are there the first time. lol
It was cafe hopping with my favourite Mambong. Dash ordered; Poached Eggs on Toast | $8 with lamb sausage | $4 while I had mine with half avocado | $2.50. The items are all add onz to the dish. We also ordered their Lavender Latte | $5.50. Heavenly!
Runny eggs on sourdough bread and additional bacons strips. Happy TGIF ! 
It\'s Coffee. What\'s not to love?
We are half way there, Happy h\'day folks.
Turkey bacon, poached eggs and avocado atop a hash of corned beef. I personally would have preferred the hash to be a little crispy, but it was tasty nevertheless. The serving size is just nice.
Fluffly and soft, just the way pancakes should be! A generous pancake stack with ricotta cheese, honey, bananas &amp; crushed pistachio.
Everything we ordered was a little too sweet here, so do request for no or less sugar then add it yourself to taste. Lavender latte was good!
Guess we will definitely be back again! And ohhhhh it\'s from halal food sources ya! ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
A chic hangout place. Location may not be easy for some. Dessert is simple and nice. A must try at least
This was the most priciest item on the menu, but perhaps (or not) worth the tag. 3 thick pancakes arrived drenched in maple syrup, bananas, ricotta cheese and crushed pistachios. Pancakes were dense and not the kind of fluffy airy kinds that I was expecting. Ricotta cheese went surprisingly well with the pancakes. However, give me Macs hot cakes any day and I would be contented with them already - airy and fluffy the way I like them. 
Found this not really worth the price tag, though the poached eggs were really good and soft inside and bursted in one slurp, and smoked salmon and avocado went so good. Spread the avocado on top the multigrain toast and taste was perfect with some salmon atop! Pity the toast were over toasted, being dry and hard. 
Perfectly toasted ciabatta that was crunchy on the outside and soft inside, laced with generous portions of beef and mozzarella cheese! 
A creative and unique mix that can be rather bitter to some due to the infusion of lavender bits on top. Beautiful presentation otherwise! A tad pricey though. 
Just good old warm, plain milk that\'s so ever comforting and necessary to make my breakfast a complete one. 
It\'s so pretty that it couldn\'t have been my order. #coffee #lavender
National day brunch!
A cuppa to start my sunday right.
GOOD.
An explosion of flavours and a treat for the eyes, too. 
With high ceilings, plywood tables, and humble stools, this cafe nestled in the Lavender/Jalan Besar area makes for a good stop for that caffeine fix while working on the go. True to their location, their special lavender latte ($5.50) is a total hit, as is their pancake stack served with bananas, ricotta, and drizzled with honey and crushed pistachio ($15). Remember to push the gold door if you\'re struggling to find the entrance!
I\'m happy with the poached egg and coffee, and who knew avocado could taste like cheese. But $10.50 for 2 toast bread and poached egg and half a avocado is pretty overpriced #hipster #cafe #pleasestopplayingloungemusic #myheadhurts #breakfast #avocado #poachedegg
Beef steak ciabatta, poached eggs on today with smoked salmon and pancake stake. Yumz in our tumz!
Beef steak ciabatta, Pancake stack and Eggs on toast with smoked salmon 
Pancakes stuffed with banana bits and drizzled with maple syrup. Definitely a must-try when you visit The Bravery!
Pancake was good but not the best I\'ve tasted. Flavour was full! 
Pancakes stack with bananas and ricotta cheese, Avocado on Corned¬†Beef Begedil, Lavender Latte and Flat White ‚ô°
\n@ $15 you r treated to a stack of 3 pancakes w Banana, Ricotta Cheese, Honey &amp; Crushed Pistachio. Relatively filling for one, the compliments (ie. honey) were too little IMO (but the waiter generously offered me an extra portion)! Definitely a must try here at the Bravery!\n
Pancakes weren\'t too bad, fluffy and moist. The ricotta cheese complemented the honey and pancakes nicely, but was insufficient to eat with 3 pancakes. Slightly caramelised banana was a nice break from the fullness of eating the pancakes. 
Fried eggs were well done, the yolks were still runny! Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of the dish. Shredded cabbage tasted stale and weird. Tortilla was alright, as was the anchovies sauce with beans. Couldn\'t taste no Parmesan cheese. Very pricey, not worth the $14.
Skip the s\'mores pie it\'s not worth your $$. Am not a fan of the lavender latte as well
Asked for Maple Syrup to be put on the side &amp; some Butter. #latergram
No signage yet still eye catching with those metal panel and metallic shine plates ... Look for the gold door to enter the cafe.. 
Reading a new book \"Essentialism\" on my kindle on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
Opened by the good people of The Plain, it\'s nice to sit in this space right opposite the Jalan Besar Stadium with a perfect flat white, a constant reminder that you are in fact, still in Singapore, despite the exceedingly Australian ambience. With bare-bones tables and chairs, this place gives off an earthy-cool vibe with an energy that makes you wanna go back and make great things happen. The coffee and service is fantastic, nothing short of what you would get at The Plain. Look out for the gold door!
Simple meal. Simple place. 
Working out of this simple cafe. The Lavender Latte came highly recommended.
If you love working off wooden crates and tables, this is the place for you. Quirky but cool. Rugged but welcoming. Friendly people, awesome culture. Welcome to The Bravery.
Missing avocado replaced by turkey bacon without informing me. And overdone poached. #meh #brunch
Do try! Eggs are well fried, spicy beans and anchovies are savory and the shredded cabbage on tortilla turned out surprisingly pleasant to the palette. 
A hipster, warehouse cafe in a roadside shop along Jalan Besar. Neighborhood hidden gem. 
Rump steak slivers with onion jam, melted mozzarella and tomato salsa. Plenty yummy, could use a little more seasoning for my taste. Huge portion means it\'s great for sharing!
(Excuse the jaundice filter) Soft &amp; fluffy pancakes as promised by reviews. Wish there were more pistachios
Poached egg on multigrain toast ‚Ä¢ Pancake stack ‚Ä¢ Lavender Latte \n<br />The lavender latte was the bomb, it so light yet so exquisite. A definite must have. #thebravery #vsco #cafe #cafesg #food #latte
Pancakes stack reminiscent of those I\'ve had in Australia, resized for local consumption. 3 pieces is just the right amount I reckon. Point to note: the banana and nuts ratio is great but they\'re super generous on the honey.
First fix of the year. Blessed New Year everybody ! May 2014 be your greatest year yet :)
Yummy beef steak ciabatta.. Mad full now no space for desserts :(
This stack of pancakes come in 4 layers, topped with soft bananas, ricotta, crunchy pistachio bits and honey. Top it up with some honeycomb for another $3, it really goes a long way! Be sure to get a bit of the creamy riccotta with every bite. Also, the presentation is superb. End off with their aromatic long black. Photo by Huixuan Tan.
So good!
3 stacks of pancakes with bananas, whipped cream, honey and pistachio crumbs
Not too often, you get to sip a cup of coffee with the company of foodies. An afternoon like this, is definitely worth mentioning. Life is too short for bad coffee!
Unique taste of latte. Consistency is fairly good, although i\'d prefer a stronger taste of the coffee 
Perfect fluffy #pancakes to share with a friend. With ricotta cheese, bananas, syrup and honeycomb. Amazingly good.
Coffee was not overpowered by the chocolate. It was smooth and well-blended. Although the Lemon Olive Oil cake was relatively nice, it is not something I would try again because it made me feel like I was eating cake that was soaked in olive oil. 
Food prices are a little unfriendly to the pocket but the flourless chocolate cake topped with Nutella was worth its price tag at just $6-$6.50!
The lightly salty toast induces a savoury touch in this dish. The fried eggs were fresh and yolk was runny as well.
Favourite new cafe!
Favourite new cafe
Bergedil (potato), 2 poached eggs, turkey bacon &amp; avocado - S$17. Had to give this place another try. Again, I was kinda disappointed. Turkey bacon was kinda salty and rather \'chewy\' instead of crispy :\\ The avocado was dark-coloured and didnt taste fresh. The perfectly poached eggs were the saviour of the meal for me
The weekend has just started. Ricotta stack pancakes and begedil hash with poached egg, bacon and avocado. #thebravery #brunch #weekend
Ordered the Raunchy Eggs and Iced mocha. It was quite good.. ambience wise, was ok, although the menu was a bit limited. Service wise, it was good too, with friendly and helpful staff serving u, how much goodness can u ever get?
Chocolate Cake... Smothered with Nutella with a dollop of cream on the side... Not too rich, not too sweet. Just nice for a chocolate cake. Doesn\'t overwhelm with chocolate such that you would feel ill trying to finish a slice. Great for a tea snack! $6.00 #burpple #coffeeandcravings
By the folks of The Plain, I pretty much prefer this new space than The Plain that\'s perpetually crowded and noisy. But I reckon this place will be flooded with people soon too =/
We checked it out when it had only been opened for about a month. The surreal and bold look of the place made me feel a little like Alice in Wonderland. #thebraverycafe
New coffee hangout from the owner of The Plain. Cool concept with stackable crates and old, scrappy walls that look like they\'re peeling. But awesome top notch coffee nonetheless.
Could possible eat the pancake every morning. So light and fluffy, you don\'t feel guilty after every bite.
The sandwich is really good. 
Pancake stack with bananas, cream and honey comb.  Presentation was faultless but the pancakes were a little dry.

A sauce made of crushed basil leaves and pine nuts just doesnt seem appealing and its acquired taste does not cater to the palates of most people.\n<br />However with a delectable blend of garlic and parmigiano cheese coating the noodle strands, the effect of the pesto sauce becomes amiably more gentle.\n<br />Add the chilled and springy duck breast to the mix and you have a very appetising dish to start off the dinner.
‚ô•Ô∏è
But dont let all these distract you from the pipping hot truffle fries that are so incredibly addictive that I ordered a second serving.\n<br />With their new dinner menu, its time for you to pop by again!
