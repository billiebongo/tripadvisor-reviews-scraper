The soft cream ‚Äì dusted with a classily mature matcha bitterness ‚Äì has the smothering intensity of a high-end Tempur pillow, and it collaborates harmoniously with the matcha syrup to bring the grainy and wheatily healthy pancakes past the gates of green tea flavour, a feat that has proved challenging to many high-profile others. 3.8/5\n<br />‚†Ä‚†Ä\n<br />P.S. Definitely ask for a switch to matcha ice cream instead of vanilla.
Ordered the recommended matcha montblanc and i wasn\'t disappointed! Paired as well with the dora yaki smoothie which really tasted like dora yaki hahaha
Many thanks to my friends for indulging me as we tried out this fable of a healthy pancake. This was actually our second attempt - we arrived around 8pm on our first visit by which the shop was already closing. 
Definitely a yummy experience at Kyushu Pancake Cafe where the pancakes taste so unique that you understand what they meant by using 8 different types of grains to get the texture. Very convenient venue around Thomson as well. It was a breeze finding the cafe.
Fluffy French Toasts topped with salted caramel sauce &amp; vanilla ice cream.
Tangy homemade berry sauce and vanilla ice cream. Girly fun with my fave ladies ‚ù§
Served with a special sauce &amp; wine honey. A lot better than expected considering previous reviews that the waffles weren\'t as crisp as they should be. Ours came pipping hot &amp; crispy and the chicken was stellar.
Not a gals hangout if we don\'t order Francine\'s fave truffle fries when they\'re on the menu
Uber fragrant milk tea, reminds us of Taiwan\'s and we\'ll happily go back just for the tea
Their pancakes are made up of 7 different grains that are grown in Kyushu. We had the Matcha MontBlanc $18, a stack of pancakes topped with matcha mousse, matcha MontBlanc sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream at the side. It wasn\'t as sweet as it looks and it\'s best for sharing. Despite the many raved reviews, it tasted rather tame in reality. At least to us.
Had been wanting to visit Kyushu Pancake Cafe ever since I drove past it before it\'s official statement on its opening on social network. Was in a dilemma on what to order, decided to order Eggs Benedict due to my love for eggs... At Kyushu Pancake Cafe, the pancakes are made with 7 different grains that are grown in Kyushu that gives it a unique taste and chewy texture. I felt that maybe they should have been more generous with their hollandaise sauce...
Nice and chewy pancake. After half of the pancake it got kinda great due to the sweetness from the matcha 
saw the popular Matcha Mont Blanc on the menu but my friend wanted to try this, and it was not too bad. only downside was the price ($16.90++) 
had this big breakfast dish for dinner, as it was one of the savoury pancakes/waffle items on the menu. filling enough for my friend and I to share taste 3/5. price 2/5 (overpriced @ $22++ imho)
It\'s just as delicious as it looks, and not too sweet. I don\'t recommend having it for breakfast on its own; you\'re going to be craving something savoury after the fourth or fifth bite.
This pancake is fluffy and „ÇÇ„Å£„Å°„Çä„ÄÇBut I prefer a bit sweeter one. The source was special for me. One is strawberry and another one is honey with alcohol may be. I liked it. The point I disappointed is customer service...though they charge customer service charge. 
A different kind of pancakes for a different audience.
I couldn\'t not get diz once I saw it on the drinks menu. Hey, it\'s a Tomato Soda (!!!) üçÖüçÖüçÖ HAHAHA. Whut is this hilarious concoction? So intrigued I had to find out. &amp; True to be told, you are served a fizzy soda (that tastes a lil too similar to our familiar 7-UP but probably less sweet) w a full, skinned tomato in all its juiciest red glory, chilling right inside your glass.üçÉ Didn\'t really know what I would\'ve expected in terms of taste but yep, I guess I wasn\'t too surprised to be tasting tomato. The staff said the tomato was cooked in their special sauce tho I couldn\'t tell if the sweetness was contributed by the special sauce or just the soda. Good thing is, tomato &amp; soda goes well. I guess it really proves that tomatoes are truly part of the fruit family üçÖ #youcanseedwithus Verdict: A refreshing, interesting &amp; delicious drink that I\'ll be sure to order again at my next visit! 
$16++. Pancake are moist and fluffy. Matcha syrup/liquid-like jam was superb bitter. Vanilla ice cream was ok, the cream was the nicest one (and the fattest). But honestly, this is seriously not worth the hype. When it eat it all together, it taste ok, not very fantastic. I don\'t understand why there are so many good reviews lol. I\'m not a gourmet but it\'s my personal opinion. I rather get McDonald\'s hotcakes, sorry guys. 
6.50++ the worst matcha latte I had. Very bitter and not very creamy. Urgh, don\'t even bother ordering this. 
Situated across from Novena Church, this famous pancake chain from Japan is known for its healthier pancakes. These are made using their signature Kyushu Pancake flour base ‚Äî a combination of seven different Kyushu-grown grains. Bring your girlfriends to share the Sample Platter ($15), which comes with pancakes, waffles and French toast ‚Äî perfect for trying a bit of everything. For something heartier, go for the American Big Breakfast ($22) ‚Äî the full works with their famed pancakes is bound to fill you up. End with something sweet like the Matcha MontBlanc ($18) ‚Äî a stack of pancakes served with yummy matcha chestnut sauce, matcha mousse and vanilla ice cream! Pro tip: Make reservations if you\'re coming on a weekend.\n<br />Avg price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler ohappydaes W
The sheer volume of chestnut drama within the thick, ropey cream would more than excite a scurry of rascally squirrels, the cream possessing a matcha powdery bitterness which adds a zen, masculine edge to the proceedings and prevents you from getting all nut creamed out. Elsewhere, the pancakes had the dense fluffiness of one of them Chow Chows from the Holland Village Pet Lovers Centre. 4.1/5
Brought my sisters there. We enjoyed the desserts that we ordered. Matcha azuki and berries Ice cream waffles. The one that stands out is the matcha Mont Blanc and ice cream.
Disappointing dish, nothing special and over price in my opinion. 19$ for this is definitely no worth it as compared to the other items on the menu.  Not in photo: Matcha Smoothie (7$) definitely not worth ordering as well.....
I was actually quite sure that I won\'t come back for a second time because of their service (other than one of the lady staff who was rly nice and genuine!!) I had to wait quite awhile for my table to be ready, then another long wait for my food. But the food turned out quite good!! The sample platter priced at 15$ is a dish I recommend everyone to order and see which food is to your liking. French toast: 5/5 ‚Ä¢ Waffle: 3/5 ‚Ä¢ Pancakes: 4/5
Second weekend here, and definitely coming back for more!
Had my brunch here 2 weekends in a row. Yes it was that good. Just remember to make reservations at least a few days before. When we were sitting at the tables, on both Saturdays, they has to turn down quite a number of disappointed customers who did not make any reservations.

So so ... The waffles weren\'t very crispy but maybe it\'s just not to my liking. Ice cream and fruits were great tho 2.5/5

Wednesday lunch date‚ù§
Made from combination of 7 selective ingredients.. I love its chewiness (not the usual soft fluffy type) but the matcha flavor was too subtle and the ice cream was so icy unfortunately\n<br />#letsnomnomSG #kyushupancake #foodporn #foodpics #burpple #matcha #montblanc #pancake

The cream was set atop their signature grainy Japanese-styled pancakes, well, can\'t say they fell flat but they were distinctively different from what you and I would have expected from your usual brekkie pancakes.\n<br />#kyushupancake #jkcelebrates29 \n<br />#desserts #dessertday #matcha
Came for the pancakes, fell for the waffle
my friend had this dish
Pancake dough taste grainy and wholesome. The thickness is just nice. With all the healthy ingredients they used, You certainly can feel that this is \'less\' sinful as it\'s not the typical buttery rich kinda taste. Matcha cream is smooth and not too sweet. Towards the light side. I mean if choosing food that is less sinful is your thing, then this meal or cafe makes a good choice..\n<br />7.1/10üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#kyushupancake#icecream#pancake#foodie#eat#delicious#makan#foodlover#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#montblanc#matcha#cafe#f4f#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#STFoodtrending#nomsteroffical
But I was left disappointed. While the meal is not bad per say,  it\'s definitely not good and sadly, I have no urge to return.. This French toast is unique and it\'s not the typical oily type. Its texture is soft and kinda like a cake/kueh-like texture.. But it\'s dry and it\'s not even warm. I was really hoping to experience the cold/warm contrast.. The taste is more to the mild side. Ice cream is nice and smooth.. Although it don\'t look like much, the toast is pretty solid and I was full midway through the meal.. Hope they can tweak abit more as it has the potential to be a great dish!

Matcha cream was light and tasted healthy! Not very sweet but Lack of authentic matcha taste! The pancake was more on a doughy side which I prefer the fluffy kind! Can\'t wait to eat the awesome ones in Aussie!\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #beautifulcuisines #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #matcha

Absolutely loved this authentic Japanese version made with 7 kinds of finely selected grains!\n<br />_\n<br />Happy blue Friday!\n<br />_
There are also savory items such as American breakfast and Eggs benedict that one can order as well
Matcha Azuki Bean Pancakes @kyushupancake.sg! At $16.90, the pancakes failed to impress. They were flat and bland in taste, and rather disappointing. Sad to say, this dish looked way better than it tasted and the deco of the cafe was more impressive.
They are like a gleeful couple which is so compatible in their texture and flavor and something just seem to be missing if they are consumed separately.
üíï loving the unique taste of the pancakes here üòã
Super tasty karaage chicken that is irresistible but definitely not the waffle - doughy and soggy.

Kyushu sunny day + classic pancake 
A nice place for meet up and pancake
This is made from 7 grains flour from Kyushu. Dense and doughy. Somehow I still prefer the American waffles which was crispier. The ice cream was also quite chewy. Read that the azuki was air flown from Hokkaido. #burpple #burpplesg #dessert #dessertstagram #dessertlover #sgfoodies #sgmakandiary #sgfoodtrend #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafenew #dessertsg #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #instasg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #eatoutsg
Most of the desserts on its menu centers around matcha, whether with pancake or waffle. Good for matcha-lovers.\n<br />The pancake was rather dense and personally, while I would personally still prefer chestnut to matcha for my Mont Blanc. #burpple #BurppleSG #dessertsg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #instafood_sg #instadessert #sgfoodies #sgfood #matcha #setheats #whati8today #foodgasm #foodieSG #foodieSG #sgeats #sgmakandiary #STFoodTrending #sgigfoodies #foodstagram #pancake #kyushu
