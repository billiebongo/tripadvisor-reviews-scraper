Cost: $18  
I\'m glad I finally did this even though I\'m a little late to the party. You can get oysters at only $2 during oysters happy hour daily from 5pm to 8pm, and I think most people already know about this. These are good, fresh raw oysters.. sourced from France, Canada, and Japan.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Every order of a cocktail ($10 to $14) entitles you to purchase of half a dozen oysters at $12, and it comes with 2 beef gyoza. I happily paid for 3 cocktails and 18 oysters, and I was a very, very happy man.
YAKINIKU DONBURI WITH ONSEN EGG HOSEI BOOOO!!! But food a bit cold though, overall is BEI PAI üëç
Now I finally know what the hype is all about... I never liked raw food so I avoided trying till now. The Truffle Yakinuku is so good!! It\'s pan seared - which works for me. The meat is really good. Love the salad with ginger dressing but the miso soup just tasted like filtered water urgh.
Wasn\'t my intention to order this but by a twist of fate, I was destined to meet you - GMCB. Such beautifully grilled crimson yellow cod fillet laid seductively on a bowl of steamed rice, so how can I say no. The fillet\'s complexion was from the mentaiko (cod roe) spreaded on, like placenta to the skin, giving it that radiant, definition and succulence. The rice used are unpolished grains to give it that unsuperflous, raw yet wholesomeness. It\'s down to the details that the rice are best served cooled to room temperature everytime, to preserve the texture that every mouthful is carb-worthy.
This is what happens when you combine 3 delicacy into one bowl - grilled teriyaki eel, aburi (torched) scallops and pan-fried duck liver. All done at amazingly delicate attention. So much umami in every mouth and complements the mixed-grain rice and the sauce, oh dear, makes me wanna...wanna....eat it all. And just what were you expecting to happen!
.\n<br />One of their best sellers, with good reason. Fluffy seasoned sushi rice, covered in shredded tamago / egg, along with smoky grilled unagi / eel, marinated in a house recipe.\n<br />.\n<br />A fatty slab of decadent foie gras, with a slight crisp exterior and a near creamy interior completes this. So good.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Tanuki Raw\n<br />More details on blog
.\n<br />Thin sliced beef sirloin, pan-fried in house-made yakiniku sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />Stacked between buttermilk rye brioche bread, with juicy tomato, crunchy lettuce, gruyere cheese, button mushrooms, and earthy truffle mayonnaise.\n<br />.\n<br />Each bit is juicy, meaty, and messy. Yum.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Tanuki Raw\n<br />More details on blog
I knew I was going to get this as I trust Tanuki to serve raw dishes at affordable prices. They started off being a raw bar (hence \"Tanuki Raw\"), I think!\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Inside this bowl of underwater freshness is a whole lot of premium Japanese raw seafood - uni, snow crab, marinated ikura, scallops and salmon, served with shredded tamago over Tanuki\'s signature brown rice. If you love their salmon, you can head over to Salmon Samurai for a whole lot of salmon choices, but it\'s here that you\'ll get that snow crab which is fresh and sweet, and that whole row of creamy uni.
$18.00\n<br />Tanuki Raw has been highly praised by the people around me and I\'m super glad it didn\'t disappoint. 
Salted duck egg char Siew. Not exactly tender seasoned nagono pork belly char Siew, onsen egg, mixed mushroom and golden salted duck egg hollandaise sauce over sushi rice.
not too bad but i don\'t think i\'ll order this again :( not a fan of their beef bowl. shall try something else next time :-)
Minus sushi roll cos they take a very long time to make that. Why though..... üòÇ
Superstar roll. Mentaiko sauce negitoro over crispy mozzarella cheese, topped with seasoned tempura flakes and tanuki raw\'s oko sauce. I like that the tempura flakes gives this sushi roll that extra crunch which is unlike normal sushi.
Or issit this outlet? I rmbed i had very yummy superstar maki ($11.90++) in the past that i used to raved about it. Then i realised, both OC and Kapok outlet have the same name dish but they do it differently. OC ones use seared salmon while Kapok one use Negitoro. Im probably not a fan of negitoro. Appreciate more if they can name it differently for a somewhat same dish. \n<br />Ordered other dishes like unagi foie gras ($23.90++), butter chicken don ($16++), Yakiniku Don ($18++), salted egg char siew don ($18++), Wham! Fries ($11.90++) and sweet potato truffle fries ($11.90++). Nth to rave about. But we pretty like the sweet potato truffle fries. Wham! Fries was kinda too sweet for our liking. üëçüèª2/5\n<br />üìç111 Middle Rd, Singapore 188969
Chirashi don. There\'s a mix of seasonal and staple fresh sashimi such as sea bream, tuna, swordfish, salmon, striped jack, and salmon roe, seasoned with their signature sauce, served with Tamago and sushi rice. Everything is so fresh too. They mixed up my order and serve mine with salad though so they gave me an extra bowl of rice with no extra charge. üòâ
The donburis and chirashi dons are the main stars at @tanukiraw but there\'s still enough room in the spotlight for the Superstar Roll ($12.90++): Mentaiko sauce drizzled over seared salmon and crispy mozzarella cheese, topped with seasoned tempura flakes and Tanuki\'s oko sauce #burpplesushimonth
Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku donburi ($23++) at Tanuki Raw. Contains pan seared foie gras, US black angus short rib, onsen egg, truffle soy and black garlic brown butter over Tanuki Raw\'s Signature Rice. The signature rice was really tasty but as for the rest of the bowl (excluding the onsen egg of course) it seemed pretty average to me
Perfect satisfaction in a bowl: medium rare seared yakiniku resting on a bed of truffled sushi rice, embedded onsen egg, and grilled foie gras. I like the texture of the rice, which has that barley like texture and grainy fragrance.
Sashimi was not fresh and rice was bleargh, a stark difference from my impression. How ah?! Also they got to do something about the pathway outside, it STINKS!
This is so rich. A whole slab of pan seared foie gras served over more foie gras.. because that custard beneath this sexy liver is actually chilled foie gras custard with truffle scented mushroom glaze.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The first mouth will wow you, but since it\'s ultra rich, please share between 2 to 4 of you. Crispy seaweed chips is served on the side to dip them into the foie gras custard, but they were also good on its own.
Initially held high expectations for their Tanuki Kaisen Chirashi ($24.90) - uni, tuna, negitoro, salmon sashimi, aburi, salmon belly, scallop, sea bream, swordfish, white tuna, yellowtail, ikura, tamago &amp; ebiko over signature rice.\n<br />.\n<br />Received a bowl overflowing with beautiful sashimi in approx. 5 minutes; amazed by the efficiency yet at the same time wondered if the sashimi were all pre-cut in advance before quick assembly.\n<br />.\n<br />Thing about chirashi is how it makes us feel like we\'re opening a pandora box to examine each piece of gem carefully. However, the whole here didn\'t taste as good as the sum of its parts - &amp; that\'s not what I usually expect from quality chirashi (which should be a good indicator of the quality of food) üòûIt\'s as if there was a missing element despite the logical combination, &amp; the grains were relatively dry. Mixing in a fair amount of soy sauce &amp; wasabi did help, but $24.90 for those? Not saying it was horrible, it just wasn\'t anywhere near exceptional (overhyped) - much like the ones we can get at local Japanese chain restaurants.\n<br />.\n<br />Food aside, I have my reservations about the ambience here, an aspect I always take for granted. The sound system basically gave me a headache all night. I can only blame myself for not being used to nightlife, sorry for simply wanting somewhere decent to enjoy my dinner üò™ &amp; Not exactly sure if it\'s related (don\'t take my word for it) but my buddy also puked &amp; fainted on the way back. Felt kind of bad for him since I brought him here to celebrate his birthday.\n<br />.\n<br />Of course, there are many mixed reviews out there &amp; I can\'t be bothered to debate. If you\'ve tried &amp; believe otherwise, good for you. Feel free to doubt my caption efforts but remember I paid to get headache.\n<br />.\n<br />Seldom name competitors, but I\'d choose @SushiroSingapore over this anytime. Brave attempts to the immensely long queue there for their quality has always exceeded my expectations. For someone rather impatient, I say they\'re worth the wait. &amp; While I\'m not a fan of their sweet rice, their chirashi\'s half the price ($12.80) with thicker, fleshier &amp; sweeter cut of sashimi (p.s. not sponsored).
Wham! Fries. Wham! Bam! Alakazam! Sweet potato fries with melted guyere, mozzarella, sour cream and spice mix. Oh wait! Like the stuff of unicorns, have an added measure of torched marshmallows too.  The stuff where your parents would scream if you mixed these as a kid. It doesn\'t have a heavy taste on the palate but the taste of childhood marshmallow and cheese with the sour cream lifting the flavour a bit. A definitely interesting purchase worth trying but not mind blowing.  Good if you\'re someone who is sick of having truffle fries again and again and again at every damn cafe.  A modern day rojak made for bored consumers.
However, it\'s harder to get something that\'s both tasty and value for money. Thankfully the bara chirashi bowl at tanuki raw ($17.80) checks off both requirements.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Alongside thick slices of tamago and pearls of briny ikura, chunky cubes of fresh sashimi are generously scattered over Tanukis\' signature vinegared sushi rice.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Try going for lunch if you can as their rice bowls are slightly cheaper! ($20 dollars during dinner)
Did you know? This only costs $7 at @tanukiraw from 5-8pm! üòõ
I\'ve tried Tanuki\'s new menu which was launched on 5 May, and this is one of their new bowls, alongside their new Hokkaido Chirashi Don and Mentaiko Cod Don.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />You get a slab of creamy pan-seared foie gras, together with grilled unagi glazed with savory housemade unagi sauce, and lots of clean, fresh hotate - and there\'s really a lot of hotate in this bowl. All these, with shredded tamago served on top of their signature Tanuki rice.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />They\'re famous for their yakiniku foie gras don.. most people I know love their foie gras but some didn\'t like their black Angus beef short rib, so this could be a good option for you :)
I chose the Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku ($21.90)! I also ordered a set which comes with a drink, miso soup and salad. The beef is drizzled with truffle soy sauce and the foie gras is glazed with black garlic brown butter.As expected, the US black Angus short rib and pan seared foie gras was so melt in your mouth GOOD and flavorful from all the seasoning. There is also an onsen egg in the middle which you can mix with the Tanuki\'s signature rice. You also will notice that the whole dish is sprinkled with truffle. Really recommend people to try this out. :)
I like their tag line. üòä Everything tasted delicious, Maki, garlic butter chicken don and salmon kaisen. The rice is special type mixed with seasoning and sesame seeds! Even my first paid cocktail tasted right, watermelon sake (got to order as happy hour promo is get 1 drink get up to 6 oysters at $2/each). Their shop layout is very sleek as well, nice place to chillax. Felt like I been kept eating many jap food these days, what up with my taste bud trend. ü§î #donburi #behappy #sgfood #burpple #igsg
Where should you go when you\'re on a \"budget\" but want to have quality sashimi with variety in a jiffy? Tanuki Raw! This bowl of Bara Chirashi Don is served with thick slices of fish (a variety but I can\'t rmb their names except Salmon, Tuna, Swordfish, Uni, etc etc etc)üç£. Must try for a very reasonable price! Can\'t remember the exact amount but definitely below $30. Just remember to get to the restaurant early to avoid the insanely long dinner queue!üç± #burpplesushimonth üòã
Quite good but they\'re a bit heavy handed on the mayo so it\'s hard to taste the mentai.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Would stick to the tried and tested truffle beef don next time.
Donburi Be Happy (Lunch Menu) 
One of the best sushi I have ever tasted. The flavour is strong and the ingredients portion is just nice. I would recommend this to everyone.
This is how spam fries should be done. Thick-cut babies with light-as-feather, thin-crisp skin. Each bite reveals intensely flavoured, msg-filled, meaty centres. As vegans and health nuts shudder in delight, carnivores and folks with permanent #drunkcravings relish each indulgent stick. With nary a taste of rancid oil, you\'ve got a delish bar snack. I\'m also enamoured by the fact that rather than use goopy, cloying cheese, #TanukiRaw geniuses have drenched the bucket of yummy with sour cream, guacamole and salsa. The cooling nature of the dip offsets the oiliness and heaviness of the fries. So you\'ve got fresh guac and sour cream with guilty pleasure fries, what better way to enjoy than with a  cold beer!
I have lost count of the number of times I have been a patron at tanuki raw. However, I have not been here in a couple of months and decided, it is time to return. Ordered both of our favorites - Kaisen chirashi don // foie gras truffle yakiniku don and they did not disappoint. In fact, I feel that tanuki has even \"upped their game\" with their tasty mixed rice topped to the brim with fresh sashimi and saucy meat. My love for you will never die, tanuki raw üëåüèºüëåüèº
12.90$
23$
Value for money, add $2 for soup, salad &amp; tea. Quality of the seafood is fresh..
Somewhat similar to the Foie Gras Truffle don, just without the foie gras. Breaking open the onsen egg, together with a mouthful of the flavoured rice, perfectly seared beef with a hint of Truffle taste; ahhhhh the perfect masterpiece waiting to be devoured
When I burst the onsen egg, the thick yolk oozes and fused with the truffle perfectly. The wagyu slices were pink and tender, drenched in truffle soy. But the show stopper was generous slab of pan-seared foie gras, glistening perfection that melts in your mouth. Each grain of Tanuki signature mixed rice is covered with the black garlic brown butter. Brb, I\'m in heaven.
truffle yakiniku donburi with foie gras and onsen egg, garden salad with ginger dressing and miso soup garnished with chives
Yes yes yes! This $16 bowl of goodness is exactly what I was looking for to satisfy me. A perfectly tender pan-fried chicken cutlet covered in garlic brown butter teriyaki sauce, sitting on top of mixed mushrooms and Tanuki Raw\'s signature rice. The hype is real people! Get amongst it!
My arteries might be crying out, but they know very well that it\'s all worth it. My first bite of the pan-seared foie gras with a little bit of the rice covered in the onsen egg just melted in my mouth, leaving a lingering taste of the subtle truffle soy sauce flavor. Boy, it was heavenly!
While the beef bowl (14.8++) certainly wasnt bad, i think it doesnt fully live up to its hype. However considering the price, its pretty worth it with decently tender beef and a strong truffle aroma.
üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />How about a bowl of Garlic Butter Chicken? ($16+) // Pan-fried cutlet, garlic brown butter teriyaki sauce, mixed mushrooms over Tanuki Raw\'s signature rice..\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#ThrowbackThursday Dinner w @thegrowingbelly // It was a great meet-up, see you soonüíï \n<br />#burpple
Pretty taste white cold brew ($5) for @tanukibar at Kapok - creamy with a good hint of sweetness ‚òïÔ∏è
üò≥\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The rice do adds up as a bonus though, the rice was the bomb, with the runny egg on top and pickles. The only thing that was disappointing to me was the meat I would say. üôÄ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Have a good Saturday everyone! Hashtag #thegrowingbelly to share your meals with us!

‚Ä¢\n<br />With so much hype surrounding it, i was eager to try it out and see for myself. \n<br />However.....despite it being the signature item, this donburi was absolutely disappointing. i feel that it was lacklustre &amp; \'underwhelming\'. The beef wasn\'t mind-blowing awesome in terms of taste &amp; texture. The onsen egg wasn\'t runny. The truffle soy sauce was barely existence. üåüThe only highlight of the bowl was the riceüåü \n<br />#burpple
Presentation looks really appetising, with pan-seared foie gras, US black Angus short rib and an onsen egg. If you do not like the signature rice you can change it to normal sushi rice.
Negitoro don ($18). Chopped Tuna and scallops with fried black garlic chips and that perfect onsen egg.
This place is awesome!! üôåüèº love the ambience it provides. Most importantly, the food matches up to the ambience too! Had this sashimi bowl of goodness. Fresh and worth it. Topped it up with potato fries which were great as well! A great chill-out place after work in town area :) Highly Recommended! 
This creative snack actually came with uni on top of a donut. It\'s also dressed with sour cream and soy dressing, and topped with an onsen egg.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Very promising dish but several problem with this. One, the uni was fishy and wasn\'t very fresh. Second, this bizarre combination don\'t work for me, the donut was probably too heavy for uni, and I can\'t make sense of how the sour cream, soy dressing and burnt leek is supposed to complement one another seamlessly.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the donut on its own, as I creamed it with the sour cream and lifted with some umami from the bonito flakes.
I don\'t eat raw food. But I ate this!!! So fresh that it\'s tasty!!!! I ate all of it haha. The crowd was abit loud tho so we had to go somewhere else to chill after eating.
An indiscriminate carnality for both goose liver and raw salmon took my wallet hostage one day, and word on the street was that Tanuki Raw was the best negotiator for this stand-off. 
üçî\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The brown butter buns are light &amp; crispy, Char Siew was definitely a thick cut, the sauce was done nicely. Overall it was average, nothing much to shout about. Pretty decent. üèµ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPSüíÆ: If you dine at Tanuki Raw, choose their \"Creations by Tanuki\" instead of \"Tanuki\'s Must Try Donburis\" as the standard have dropped a notch. üññüèª
The Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku Donburi ($23) was a hearty bowl of donburi served with generous slabs of black angus short rib &amp; perfectly seared foie gras. As it was happy hour, we got some fresh &amp; juicy oysters for $1 each üòã Definitely coming back for this!
Pan-Seared Foie Gras, US Black Angus short rib, Onsen Egg, Truffle Soy, black garlic brown butter over Tanuki\'s signature rice.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />One just can\'t go wrong with the classic combination of Foie Gras, Short Rib &amp; an Onsen Egg on a bed of rice. Sadly however, it lacked Character, Depth &amp; Soul. \n<br />Tanuki Raw once used to be not a bad place to get your Donburi fix. But the magic\'s gone. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPSüíÆ: Do not hold back when you decide to enjoy a bowl of really good Truffle/Beef Donburi. Some places like Sushi Jin, Aoki, Tatsuya &amp; others have a pretty high price tag for it. üí∏\n<br />But trust me (at least this once), it\'ll be worth it. Your soul will thank you. üññüèª
Lunchtime menu well-worth.\n<br />Good portion of sashimi and pan-seared salmon, and a just-right amount of salty ikura. It was a huge bowl of rice too.
With pocket-friendly lunch prices and beautiful plated presentation, it\'s no wonder why Tanuki Raw is still going strong on Instagram. Covered in succulent pan-fried short ribs and a wobbly onsen egg, their Truffle Yakiniku ($14.90++) is a sure crowd-pleaser. The Garlic Butter Chicken ($12.90++) is also a safe bet for people who prefer traditional Japanese flavours.
üí∏ $14.90\n<br />(Exclusive of GST &amp; SVC CHARGE)
The Salmon Kaisen (Lunch: $12.90; Dinner: $16) serves a generous amount of fresh, juicy salmon. The Tanuki signature mixed rice though, is a tad too dry. It\'s not as tasty fragrant having tried other dons on their menu. The don serves salmon prepared in four different ways: salmon sashimi, cubed spicy salmon, aburi salmon belly, mentaiko seared sashimi. Plus ikura. With this one, I\'m pretty sure they forgot one üôäOtherwise, lunch prices sure make a tempting offer.
This bowl means some serious business. The truffle yakiniku donburi is probably one of the best Japanese rice bowls I have eaten. Break open the onsen egg, take a mouthful of the flavoured Japanese rice, take a slice of the beautifully seared beef short ribs with truffle sauce, dip it in the egg porn, place it on top of the rice, and there you have it, a spoonful of the ultimate masterpiece waiting to be devoured. It is definitely a must try, especially if you are a beef lover like me. 
Ahh....the all famous @tanukiraw! So far i\'ve eaten this 5 times and ordered the same thing - truffle yakiniku don with foie gras. It is not going to blow your minds, but there is just something so comforting about it. I ask for leaner cuts of beef, otherwise i can never finish this bowl due to fattiness.
I\'m an avid fan of Tanuki Raw\'s Foie Gras and Truffle Yakiniku Don, so much so I\'ve frequented the place numerous times to eat the same damn thing -- it really is their best seller for a reason! However we all have our flaws, and the \'Raw\' in Tanuki is definitely not their forte. 
The dish was so nicely presented to begin with: 12 thick and juicy glazed beef slices atop fragrant sesame rice, sprinkled with truffle bits and topped off with a lovely Onsen tamago egg just made me fish out my chopsticks all that much faster. The beef slices glowed a healthy pink, its barbecued aroma wafting through the air. The truffle fragrance was definitely prevalent here without being overwhelming. Putting the beef in my mouth, I was bowled over, and that is an understatement to say the least. The beef was so tender, brimming with its oils and melted so deliciously without needing to chew much. 
Tastes awesome but not enough as a meal. Would recommend it as a starter to share.
Foie Gras Truffle Yakinuki (Lunch: $19.90; Dinner: $23) Bursting my onsen egg, the oozing of thick yolk fuses with the fragrance of the bits of truffle so well I couldn\'t stop myself from finishing it as it was, not mixing it into the rice. The wagyu slices were pink with a tender chew and a bit of fat, drenched in truffle soy. But it\'s the generous slab of pan-seared foie gras, glistening in perfection, that got me squealing in delight. It\'s an soft indulgence that melts on your tongue. Each grain of Tanuki signature mixed rice is covered with the black garlic brown butter, with mushrooms to go with. The tasty seasoned pearls in between mouthfuls toned my tastebuds down a notch, only so I could excite them again with it like a tease!!! http://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/2017/01/10/Tanuki-Raw-Orchard
It\'s the Salmon Kaisen (Lunch: $12.90; Dinner $16) from Tanuki!Salmon is served up in four different ways here. In a mix of salmon sashimi, cubed spicy salmon, aburi salmon belly, mentaiko seared sashimi, plus ikura to top it off. All fresh, juicy and generously served. Tanuki\'s signature mixed rice was swapped for lettuce with this one upon request. We had one with rice too but found it a tad dry. Still, it makes a good lunch deal for salmon sashimi!
„Ä∞ $18++
Fries at Tanuki Raw is really something. Sweet potato fries with salted duck egg, mozzarella, gruyere, Tanuki spice mix and sour cream.
Salmon Kaisen ($16.00++)
Probably the best beef bowl on a budget; $23++ gets you meaty slices of grilled US angus short rib drizzled with truffle soy sauce, an oozy onsen egg, and a slab of seared foie gras glazed with black garlic brown butter on pearly grains of seasoned rice.
this bowl consists of different type of salmon preparation. loved every single one of them. its def worth its price, $13
Most people would get the beef bowl but  don\'t eat beef. Took a while before I kinda got used to the rice because of the ginger taste. Perhaps I should have ordered the Salted Duck Egg Char Siew instead.
Sea urchin, tuna, negitoro, salmon, aburi salmon belly, scallop, sea bream, swordfish, white tuna, yellowtail, ikura, egg, and ebiko ‚Äì all that variety in one bowl sure makes for a pretty colourful picture!
By far one of the best negitoro that\'s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I\'m lovin it!
This was one mean bowl of goodness. The rice was seasoned soooo well, it wasn\'t just your normal white rice, there was so much flavour packed into it. I felt that the rice portion was just nice while some may think it wasn\'t quite as filling. The beef and pickled radish and onsen egg was to perfection as well and had a good truffle punch. There was some thin slices of shiitake(?) mushroom in it as well. I could do without the foie gras tho, just my opinion as I can\'t rly appreciate it. But my pal was swept away by it. 
Personally prefer the truffle yakiniku because the rice for the Salmon kaisen is a little too dry. But the Salmon is very fresh and delicious. Both is less than  $40. Quite filling for a lunch set.
esp the range of food available. That fat foie gras with beef and eggporn. \"The saddest kind of sad is the sad that tries not to be sad.\" Words to describe me now üôç
Half dozen/$30. Fresh, sweet, delightful! Paired with their own onion dip &amp; lemon!
Freshly sliced sashimi to go with their signature rice, though rice is on the dry side. Add your own soy sauce with wasabi for flavor enchancement. $20.
Roasted beef done so well of the charred flavor $18, with onsen egg. Though the rice is a bit on the dry side.
Too much rice.. The sashimi slices were thick and nice, but I still prefer The Sushi Bar for overall dining experience.
The tender beef combined with the runny yolk gives an amazing burst of flavours in your mouth. Adding the foie gras to the combination brings the dish to a whole new level. \n<br />Will not recommend other dishes though. #burpple
wasn\'t expecting a block of chopped meat and was sceptical about it at first. but it tasted great! chopped fatty tuna, onsen egg and Tanuki\'s signature rice üëç
At $23, you get a perfect donburi bowl to indulge in of such perfectly seared foie gras that melt in your mouth, oozy onsen egg, rice that is drenched with garlic butter rice, tender beef with a faint hint of truggle taste. I can\'t help but wanting to get a second bowl. A must try if you manage to beat the queue and get a table
Oiishi bowl of beef and foie gras that melts in your mouth.
Not much of salted egg yolk taste... But Char Siew is really tender.
Famous for their donburi! But why not try their other dishes on the menu? Here\'s one of their many maki:\n<br />Golden Kani Maki - rolled maki with deep fried house seasoned soft shell crab, fresh snow crab, cucumber and crispy mozzarella with toasted seaweed and a generous dose of golden salted duck egg hollandaise\n<br />The best soft shell crab maki ever! Generous hunks of sweet crab meat paired perfectly with deliciously savoury salted egg sauce. Fragrant sticky jap rice soaked up the yummy sauce. Gigantic portion.

Time to hit the gym after stuffing myself with a WHOLE LOT OF FOOD.
Salmon kaisen don ($12.90) and everyone\'s favourite truffle yakiniku don ($14.90) - you won\'t go wrong with their (generally) affordable rice bowls that make filling AND aesthetic lunches.
üòç How about some #tanukiraw Foie Gras Truffle üçÑ Yakiniku üêÑ  Don to set the mood right? Absolutely loved the Angus Short Ribs, done perfectly medium rare and melt-in-the-mouth. The Foie Gras was ok, but slightly drowned in the sauce... Would have been yums with just the simplest salt and pepper. Still, enough to make me a happy girl for the day! üôÜ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
Ordered in these beautifully seared, fragrant truffle yakiniku with still-runny Onsen eggs and tasty well-seasoned rice, superstar maki (mentaiko sauce negitoro, crispy mozzarella cheese, tempura flakes, and their signature oko sauce) so we didn\'t have to step out. The laziness is strong in this side of the office üòõ
The Wham! Fries ($11.90) is an interesting combination of sweet potato fries with marshmallows and sour cream which I love üòç \n<br />The tanuki kaisen chirashi don ($24.90) was a little of a let down though üò•
Foie gras truffle yakiniku ($23++), Bara chirashi ($20++), Salmon Kaisen ($16++)\n<br />This is my first visit after their renovation. We were assign to their counter seat so we can actually see how they prepared all their food. So i wasn\'t really comfortable on how the place their rice at open air while making all the maki.\n<br />The yakiniku had become too salty for my liking &amp; did they missed out the truffle?? Further disappointed by sashimi\'s quality although the quantity is quite generous. üòù not worth queuing anymore\n<br />6
$19.90. Very worth it especially since the black Angus short rib tasted fantastic especially with the truffle soy, black garlic brown butter sauce. The onsen egg was good and the yolk was runny when we cut it open. The pan seared foie gras taste so good with the sauce and I find it to be extremely affordable. You will surely feel full after eating one of this dish. Fantastic and unpretentious!!
$22.90 for this chirashi don. Felt that it was very feeling and special. Also the price is rather affordable for a chirashi don with so many huge pieces of sashimi. One of the nicer places to eat japanese food and even when it wasn\'t during the lunch hour, there were still many people there. I found the service to be very quick and fast considering they had to prepare such an aesthetic bowl of chirashi don. It was very special and definitely worth every single cent of your money. Recommended if you like sashimi because it will satisfy you! Fantastic place to eat Japanese food
This is definitely one of the best things on Tanuki Raw\'s menu. Not only was it delicious, the fries really taste extremely amazing with huge portions of thick cut fries served with the truffle aioli. What I really liked was that they allowed and were willing to refill the truffle aioli sauce for us the moment we finished and wanted more. The service was good and quick. Fantastic place to go to if you want to have a good meal. This sweet potato fries is $10.90 well spent!!
I must. Don\'t forget to check out their cheaper deals during lunch!
Waited for an hour for a Friday dinner hoping to get our hands on the Tanuki Kaisen Chirashi, specifically for the uni. Our bowls came served this way and until we asked, we found out that the sea urchin was unavailable for the day and swapped with more negitoro. ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è Would have really appreciated it if we were informed during order - we would have opted for a cheaper option like their normal Chirashi (not that big a fan of the negitoro too). The bed of signature seasoned rice came in a big portion but could have been less dry, while the considerably thick slices of sashimi were fresh albeit inconsistent cuts. I personally prefer normal unseasoned rice for less complicated flavours though! 
There\'s something so perfect about a one-bowl meal. Equal parts comforting and efficient - and this is especially true when you\'re in the middle of a busy day, you need all the time-saving power that a meal in a bowl can provide. Dropped in at Tanuki Raw for a late lunch and was bowled over by all the tantalizing bowl options. Settled for the two crowd favourites.
The pork belly was cooked to melt in your mouth kind of perfection and there was #yolkporn when you break open the egg üòç salted duck egg sauce completed the pork belly well but unfortunately, my search for a good cuppa flat white continues...
Not bad... But I think garlic doesn\'t go with kaisenüò©üò©üò©üò©üò©
... in my sniffy, sneezy mode ü§íüò∑üò™ Had heard mixed reviews about the food here... but we decided to give it a try anyway. The rice bowls were decent (rice was somewhat dry and al dente), I did enjoy my Salted Duck Egg Char Siew Donburi. Meats were good, very mild salted egg flavour... and when there\'s a perfect runny onsen egg üç≥ like that, nothing can go wrong! üòâ
So this time, I tried another one of Tanuki Raw\'s creations. Tender seasoned Nagano Pork Belly Char Siew, Onsen Egg, Mixed Mushroom with Golden Salted Egg Hollandaise with warm Sushi Rice! Worth the calories and IMHO must try!! 5/5
The hunt for the best Chirashi Don continues! I would personally recommend coming here during Lunch time for the lunch menu. There\'s no difference in food or quality but it\'s $2-$3 cheaper than if you came at dinner time! Sashimi wise it wasn\'t the best quality for the price - but I loved the variety of their Chirashi Don ($20.00).
Delicious Kaisen Chirashi Don..\n<br />A mix of seasonal and staple sashimi including scallop, sea bream, tuna,  swordfish, salmon, striped jack and salmon roe, negitoro, sea urchin seasoned with our signature sauce served with tamago on sushi rice.  Super fresh, yummy &amp; totally worth it!! 5/5
I\'ve always questioned these hypes. What could possibly be so fascinating about a beef donburi? But true enough, it was pretty good.\n<br />1) The ambience was great. Integral to every restaurant experience -I believe- is the environment. A great view and 3rd wave caf√© style interior designing did it for me\n<br />2) The yakiniku was succulent and well seasoned. But the taste was not mature and conplex; vindicated by what I saw which was the cook carving a pink piece of beef, indicating the non aging of the beef. Howbeit, the caramelisation and maillard reactions of the protein really brought out the taste if the beef. The onsen egg was good, and the rice could afford to be slightly more developed; flavour profile wise. Howbeit, still great food!!! \n<br />3) Great service. The service staff were friendly and helpful. A shout out to the bartender(we set at the bar) who was very kind and helpful tooüòÅ\n<br />Overall great trip and relatively good value for the quality.\n<br />Truffle donburi $18
Looking for the perfect donburi bowl in town? Fix your cravings with Tanuki Raw salivating lunch set menu! You can\'t miss the soft melty foie gras with a crisp at the edge, lean and tender slices of beef ribs and the dollop of runny onsen egg right at the center of the bowl! Rice was flavorful with a hint of truffle and garlic. Daily lunch set offering comes with a side salad, miso soup and a cup of refillable green tea! Good savings to your pocket! 
Oysters downed with a tall glass of Gin Tonic, just brings that Friday night buzz of happiness in my tummy.... 
Slightly expensive but worth every penny I\'ll say. My friend insisted to mix all the ingredients and rice together, destroying the beautiful presentation but BEST DECISION ever. I\'ll eat it again, preferably during lunch hours as the lunch sets are cheaper.
Beef was juicy and tender. The buns were fried and a bit on the oily side. That being said it was a great dish. :)
My mum ordered the signature rice bowl-foie gras was perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture, and the beef was a lovely medium rare. Personally, I felt the bowl was a tad bit rich, but this is definitely a must for meat-lovers! The truffle sauce was minimal so it wasn\'t overpowering, and the runny yolk mixed really well with the rice as well! Yummy!
I don\'t take beef but their truffle yakniku bowl are at $14.90++. Tried their salted duck egg char Siew ($15.90++), good but not sometime I will keep going for.
The texture of the angus short ribs is slightly sinewy. The dish was slightly cold and lacks heat. The foie gras was just simply foie gras. There wasn\'t much sweetness or astringency to counter its richness. I would have preferred a sligtly charred texture to its outer layer but that is missing. The onsen egg lacks flavour. 
Somehow I prefer the cuts at sushi bar. It is somewhat inconsistent here, unlike other places where you get a certain size. And also this time I sat at the bar, I noticed that the guy arranging the fish on the bowls handled the fish and the carbon order copies with his hands (with gloves on). Oh well, probably not so excited to come back again.. 
Not too bad! Exceeds expectation and value is there for the lunch pricing. 
PLEASE RECOMMEND CAFES AT TANJONG PAGAR TO ME, GUYS!
Lived up to the hype! Could actually taste the truffle and the serving of beef was generous! üîÜüîÜüîÜüëçüèº almost died of joy when the onsen egg burst to reveal the most sunshine yellow üòã I must say that their lunch set was worth it at $16.90!
It\'s all about salmon here. A mix of salmon sashimi, aburi salmon belly, cubed spicy salmon, mentaiko seared salmon sashimi and ikura over Tanuki\'s signature mixed rice.
We\'re not usually fans of truffle fries, but damn, these sweet potato fries are pretty darned good. What looks like a poached egg is in actual fact, a dollop of sour cream blanketed by an addictive truffle aioli which we would\'ve loved to have more of. It is death by truffle~
Generous servings of fresh salmon prepared in 3 different ways with roe and salad. Long queue (half hr during sunday lunch time), but... yums + value for money, will be back!
So the search for affordable yet delicious chirashi don continues! For the price, I thought this wasn\'t too bad. But not particularly outstanding, so I guess I wouldn\'t return to eat this again, unless for lunch. Maybe I should try the highly raved foie gras beef yakiniku don!
If I were you, I\'d head down to orchard central NOW for that Thursday fix.
The onsen tamago pairs really well with the rice below it. The beef is also soft and juicy but it\'s kinda small in portion. The foie gras serving is so big I had to share it. :)
Salmon Kaisen ($12.90 during lunch hours). Comes with a generous amount of fresh sashimi, along with Aburi Salmon that adds a little bit of diversity to an otherwise ordinary salmon donburi. The rice was a boon though, cold and dry as opposed to the moist sushi rice that is normally found in donburi. Truffle Yakiniku was fine, with the runny onsen egg that made the rice moist. The offering at Grilllo had a much stronger truffle flavour and a tastier cut of beef.
This was the dish caught my eye the moment I set my sight on the menu. The pan seared foie gras, US Black Angus Short Rib &amp; Onsen Egg  with Tanuki\'s Signature rice complemented each other so well...the truffle soy and black garlic brown butter was just like the icing on the cake!! Must try!! 5/5
These sliders were rather interesting as the buns were not typical ones but Katsu-Crusted Brown Butter ones! These lovely buns were filled with thinly sliced sirloin steak pan fried in Tanuki\'s signature Yakiniku sauce topped off with truffle mayo &amp; umami gruyere, accompanied with fresh greens and tomato! Worth trying cos eating a slider with such texture was a whole new one to me! 5/5
This rendition of a Maki was pretty interesting with Salmon &amp; Scallop wrapping a roll of snow crab, unagi, avocado and cucumber. Topped off with Torched Wasabi Mayo, Tanuki Oko Sauce, crispy Katsuo flakes and chives, it was jus a lovely combi! 4/5
Freshly shucked oysters need no introduction! Perfect appetizer although ours only came after the mains. Yummy nonetheless.. 4/5
This maki roll is fully packed and loaded with goodness! There were scallops and salmon on the outside, drenched with Tanuki\'s special sauce and torched wasabi mayo, then topped with crispy katsuo flakes and chives. And that\'s not all! The maki tightly wrapped snowcrab, unagi, cucumber and avocado inside. Looking uber inviting, I can\'t help but to shamelessly stuff one whole piece of maki into my big mouth. *burps* üòÑ
The beef was too chewy for my liking. I would have preferred it to be cooked for slightly longer (less raw).
Thick and tender Nagano Pork Belly Char Siew with golden salted duck egg hollandaise sauce poured over them. An onsen egg and mixed mushroom on the side. Different but I doubt it\'s something I\'ll go back for.
Put off tanuki raw for quite some time as I\'ve read some negative reviews but turns out they were wrong.. Happy with my rice bowl.. The short ribs were very tasty and chewy. And the foie gras.. Generous portion :) Service was prompt and excellent. \n<br />The only thing I didn\'t like was the rice, too dry, hard and not flavourful enough. \n<br />Still, this is super value for money as its $19.90 ++ for lunch!
Truffle Beef Bowl. Luscious, and flavours all in place. No wonder it\'s the signature bowl here. Be prepped to queue at mealtimes though. Now if only it was served piping hot and egg yolk unbroken... Ig:herpenandfork
This time trying out their chirashi salad and some superstar maki, whilst my virgin @chewypompipi had the truffle yakiniku don!
In need of a don fix? Try the Salmon Kaisen Don; salmon 4 ways ($12.80 for lunch) includes salmon sashimi, aburi salmon, spicy salmon, mentaiko seared salmon sashimi &amp; not forgetting them salmon roe!
Finally tried Tanuki Raw after its revamp on my day off. The Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku Bowl ($19.90 if you order between 11.30am-3pm; otherwise $23) came loaded with a decent-sized seared goose liver, thinly sliced US black angus short rib and an onsen egg on top of their signature seasoned rice and elevated with truffle soy &amp; black garlic brown butter - a mishmash of flavours and texture that made this heaven in a bowl. 
As if their beef bowls couldn\'t get any better, they added a generous piece of foie gras and took it to the next level. The beef pieces were still tender and delicious, but the star of this had to be the foie gras. It paired really well with the black garlic brown butter and was an amazing accompaniment to the rice (which, tbh, could get a little dry). Super worth the price, especially during lunch. 
Price during lunch is $17.80. Mix of sashimi including tuna, salmon belly aburi, salmon sashimi, scallop, sea bream, swordfish, white tuna, yellow tail, ikura, tamago, ebiko over tanuki\' signature mixed rice. Option to pay $1 to change rice to salad. Variety of fish is good, and quality is there, rice is flavorful unlike those plain vinegar rice. If I had a complain it would have to be the cuts of the fishes, they are pretty inconsistent in sizes, some are pathetically tiny And the last thing I didn\'t like is the wasabi, which is of very poor quality. Overall, i think it is still value for money 
The restaurant wasn\'t crowded and it was pretty comfy to eat in groups (: The salted duck egg char siew rice bowl was okay, nothing fancy. There wasn\'t veggies so the meat feels overwhelmed actually. 
Wham, bam, thank you ma\'am for all those additional love handles! With sour cream, mozzarella and marshmallows loaded onto these fries, you can bet the healthy choice of sweet potato fries goes flying outta the window! 
üëÖ \n<br />The branch at Orchard Central just reopened so don\'t forget to grab their ever-famous Truffle Yakniku Don at $14.80 in the afternoon. Break that perfect Onsen egg over the bowl of seasoned rice and pan seared beef short rib  and ERRGGHHH IT\'S PERFECT!!!!!! üò©üòã

Salmon sashimi fans ALERT! Here\'s one good donburi to satisfy all your cravings in one bowl. ::::Salmon 4 ways:::: Salmon Sashimi ‚Ä¢ Aburi Salmon Belly ‚Ä¢ Spicy Salmon ‚Ä¢ Mentaiko Seared Salmon Sashimi ‚Ä¢ All that goodness resting on tanuki\'s signature mix rice. &amp; that ikura.... You won\'t wanna miss it, REALLY. 
Foie gras truffle yakiniku don! Generous stab of foie gras with slices of beef &amp; an onsen egg! Lunch set priced at 21.90 &amp; well worth the $$! The beef was a bit tough though.. Their chirashi don comes with many slices of sashimi &amp; looks good!
At $24.90, the Kaisen Chirashi Don is truly worth your money. What stands out is the generous portion of sashimi on offer - fat slices of salmon &amp; tuna compete for space with creamy sea urchin, springy tobiko roe, and melt-in-your-mouth ikura. Plus, unlike most other chirashi joints that use plain old white rice, Tanuki Raw takes pride in their signature \'Tanuki rice\' - rice mixed with Japanese seaweed &amp; spices for a truly umami finish. While you\'re there, do try the WHAM! Fries ($13.80, not pictured) off their new menu as well! The crisp sweet potato fries go surprisingly well with the gooey torched marshmallows, and yet are balanced by the dollop of sour cream on the side. 
$13.80 for a huge bucket of spam fries topped with their special seasoning powder, guacamole and sour cream. 
Today\'s #yolkporn ! Uni Donut ($21.90) \n<br />@tanukiraw creation\n<br />Sea urchin, sour cream onsen egg on top of a tanuki-style pull apart donut made with a blend of tanuki spice mix, buckwheat and scallions. Drizzled with a burnt leek and soy dressing and topped off with bonito flakes and toasted seaweed.
Have you ever had a uni donut?
$12.80 for a generous serving of 4 different salmon cuts served with flavoured vinegar rice. Super worth it!
Pretty value for money for $14.80 during lunch hours. The truffle scent is not overpowering, complimenting the taste of the yakiniku beef. Served with vinegar flavoured rice and onsen tamago. Very appropriate serving leaving my tum happy. :) I will be back.
Oysters going at $2 (6 piece per alcoholic beverage purchased)\n<br />@tanukiraw
So savoury, so juicy, so tender, so addictive! üòç This photo is not doing any justice to these delicious fried chicken wings which were marinated with Tanuki\'s salted egg and miso bean paste. The salted egg trend continues... üòà
Revamped Tanuki Bar is relocated in the 4th level of Orchard Central with many changes to the menu!\n<br />Enticing offerings not to be missed like the insane Happy Hour Oysters and donburis . \n<br />This Uni Donut ($21) a creation by Tanuki, comes with sea urchin, sour cream, onsen egg, tanuki style pull apart donut drizzled with a burnt leek and soy dressing, topped off with bonito flakes and  toasted seaweed.\n<br />At a glance, this dish looks very appetizing with an explosive runny egg yolk!\n<br />As much as I love eggs in my food, this one just doesnt seem to compliment the uni which masked the flavour of it. Though, it\'s really good on the donut.
So happy that they reopened in Orchard Central :).\n<br />Tender seasoned Nagano Pork Belly char siew, Onsen egg, mixed mushroom, golden salted egg hollandaise over sushi rice.\n<br />Nowadays simi sai also salted egg!üòÅ
Kaisen Chirashi Don (around $22++) and Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku Don (around $19 ++) the prices vary because there is a daily lunch promotion, cutting prices down by $2 !!! This is a cafe that I will often frequent because it just sings so well with my taste buds and my goal is to try each and every single one of their dishes :-) q excited to head back again soon!!! 
MY KIND OF SLIDER.
The Mini Salted Duck Egg Char Siew Sliders - Thick-cut Tanuki-style char siew was stacked between tomatoes, fresh greens, umami gruyere and the in-house made katsu-crusted brown butter buns with a generous dollop of tangy oko sauce. The char siew (more like pork belly) has a good balance of fats and lean meat, giving a tender and chewy texture.
Tanuki Raw reopens @ Orchard Central (Level 4, next to Genki Sushi). They are back with stronger (more extensive) menu, bigger space and better quality of food! üëç
I can have jap food all day err day.
We had their foie gras truffle Yakiniku which consisted of a thick slab of foie gras that melts in your mouth, well marinated meat, flowy egg and that garlicky butter rice with mushroom has so much flavor to it, you just can\'t stop at a spoon üò±. Lunch sets go at $19.90
tanuki raw bar &amp; our perennial favourite chirashi don is back!!! bara chirashi don ($17.80) is still as flavourful, lots of fresh seafood and pearly seasoned sushi rice!! the WHAM! fries ($14) sound divine too--sweet potato fries with the works, including salted duck egg sauce &amp; charred marshmallow!!! additions also include the kaisen chirashi don ($24.90), supposedly a new-&amp;-upgraded version of the regular chirashi don?
Tanuki Raw recently reopened in Orchard Central. It\'s happy hour every day from 5 - 8pm, with $2 per oyster, with maximum 6pcs per alcoholic drink ordered! Do come early as the queues can get quite long.
the beef had lots of fats but the foie grass was awesome
Comforting sweet potato fries layered with Gruyere, lightly torched marshmallows, sour cream, then topped with guacamole, mozzarella and a secret Tanuki spice mix. #TanukiRaw #OrchardCentral
What\'s on the table: Fat Samurai, Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku Donburi, Foie Gras Donut, Golden Kani Maki, Garlic Butter Chicken Donburi, and Fresh Raw Oysters.
@tanukiraw has reopened at @orchardcentral on the 4th floor NOW!
This was one of my favourite items that we tried at Tanuki Raw last week. There wasn\'t much spiciness, but what caught my attention was the crisp shell encasing the salmon and fillings. The name Herumetto comes from the term helmet in Japanese, hence the hard seaweed shell. I\'d definitely have this again.\n<br />#TanukiRaw #AdobePost *
#TanukiRaw and their hearty rice bowls are back at #OrchardCentral. It re-opened yesterday at a larger new space on Level 4.
To be honest, I wasn\'t impressed when I tried Tanuki Raw\'s Kaisen Chirashi and Truffle Yakiniku Donburis some time back. But they\'ve won me over with this Garlic Butter Chicken bowl! Pan-fried chicken cutlet covered in garlic brown butter teriyaki sauce with mixed mushrooms. Best enjoyed by mixing everything up so you get hints of the sweet and savoury flavours throughout. I\'d definitely order this the next time I\'m at Tanuki Raw.\n<br />#TanukiRaw *
I\'m craving some fresh oysters and the Garlic Butter Chicken Donburi from Tanuki Raw. üòã\n<br />#TanukiRaw #OrchardCentral
Went to this place last year; it\'s now renovating and is temporarily located at Bras Basah. I got the Chirashi Don ($19.80) which tastes amaaaazing--large servings and a great variety of seafood from tuna to salmon and my favourite were the scallops and humongous roe--they tasted so fresh!! But it took me quite some time to find a strategic way to eat it; that is, with the addition of soy sauce and a right amount of wasabi. Anyway the Wagyu beef bowl ($14.80),despite it being the signature item, was, according to my brother, \"underwhelming\"--maybe due to the small portion of meat and no taste of the truffle present. On the other hand my friend enjoyed it thoroughly. 
Our fav dish tasted at Tanuki Raw. The Foie Gras tasted very rich and succulent and the savoury sauce used ain\'t too overpowering as well. A simple delish really üòã\n<br />.\n<br />Can\'t wait to try this dish again when they reopen in Feb at their Orchard Central outlet ~ and enjoy 25% off our total bill üòª‚ú®\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#AldoraEats #tanukiraw #tanukibar #foiegras
That wobbly onsen egg.. That perfectly flamed beef.. That insanely well-marinated rice.. That awesomely priced donburi.. Yes, I went back for this, and thankfully the rice was in a better shape, the truffled infused soy sauce, is heavier and in general this bowl was so much better than the previous visit! Seriously, the correct person making your bowl, play a huge part! Debak üòã
Took one bite of this and regretted that we ordered the small portion only. Tangy, savory mentaiko sauce on top of salmon sashimi and seasoned rice. What\'s not to love? 
Rating: 9/10. Salmon mentaiko! Its $15 for this small bowl ): but its really good! Sad wallet but a happy tummy. 
Satisfy the starving tummy by having a fulfilling lunch at @tanukiraw \n<br />Foie gras unagi don üòã #tanukiraw #saturdate
It really tastes good and I dont have time to say more. *gobbling down the don*
Lightly torched with both seared and raw texture, the salmon slices were generously covered with luscious mentaiko sauce which melt in your mouth perfectly. The tantalizing treat will definitely please your tastebud!
I have always been a fan of their Truffle Yakiniku, despite mixed reviews saying that it is overrated. Seriously for the price and the generous amount of beef with a light hint of truffle taste, there is nothing to complain about it. Particularly at $19 with foie gras, the huge slap literally melts in my mouth! Thinly crisp on the exterior, the softness of the interior was bursting with alluring aroma. \n<br />And my friend was so in love with their rice that she finished her own portion + half of mine üòÇ
Decided to have the salmon don even though the famous one is really the beef don. Overall was a nice dish, especially the nicely torched salmon belly! 
With an additional $2 for a side salad, miso soup and green tea, it is really affordable. If you want something special, the foie gras truffle yakiniku don costs only $19.
Been almost a year since I met up with these two and I realised we have all changed so much in our own ways. I really miss our carefree uni days though, when we are all less sick of life :( oh well, life goes on.
This donburi was absolutely disappointing and not fantastic at all. The beef and rice was not hot and the portion was small although I chose the bigger bowl of this. For the price that I paid, I would have expected it to be better. Would rather choose to have some bento sets at kopitiam instead. 
Truffle Yakiniku Don. Finally got to try this highly-rated meal! The beef slices were succulent and fresh, and the onsen egg was done to perfection.
First time trying and it\'s superb!! Very yummy steak and the runny egg definitely compliments well with the dry rice üòç and very affordable lunch set for only $14.90!
I decided to have a try at this place since I\'ve seen my friends all post this super photogenic beef bowl. It was great. But the sushi they had was horrid. The rice were too squishy and lumpy. the taste was off. Overpriced and I feel a little overrated. :(
Another donburi we tried was chicken yakitori! For those who doesn\'t eat beef, this was really good as well. Chicken skin was a little crispy and the meat was juicy &amp; tender at the same time. 
Finally got to try this hot favourite during lunch hour! Beef was tender &amp; juicy. You\'re able to whiff the truffle soy sauce poured over their rice bowl, complete with onsen egg which I broke and mixed it into the rice. Affordable &amp; a strike off my wish list! 
My expectations were high since it said truffle. Truffle has more of a distinctive smell than taste. I didn\'t smell truffle much less taste it. Did they sprinkle the truffle oil on the beef or cooked with it? Oh well...
Too overrated..taste is so so, with the rice that was too dry. 
The salmon and the mentaiko is nice, but again the rice is just too dry.
Back when I ate red meat, the beef bowl was amazing üòç pretty much self-saucing with the poached egg \n<br />Now I go for the salmon which is JUST AS GOOD
The meat was a bit too raw for my liking and it has some kind of beefy smelly smell but the truffle did a good job to cover that smell. The serving is just nice tho the rice was a bit too much. Overall i\'d say it\'s good for a donburi with that price range 
This place needs little introduction. With six different don choices available for lunch, Tanuki Raw is a great go-to option for lunch in the heart of town. Their Truffle Yakiniku Don ($14.80) is a hot favourite, with tender slices of black Angus short rib pan-seared in truffle soy sauce with that obligatory gooey-centred egg. Other delectable dons include the Salmon Don ($12) and the Bara Chirashi Don ($17.80). These rice bowls have gained such favour, that they\'re now available for dinner as well ($18/$20/$20 respectively)! For a lunch set, add an additional $2 for miso soup, mixed salad, and green tea.
The best timing for oysters are 5 - 8pm cos they are $2 each!! Minimally, an alcoholic drink is need for a platter of 6 yummy oysters. Fresh and cheap, why not?
It\'s truffled rice with angus short rib beef, need I say more? Yolk was done to a perfect degree and I love how the truffle gave the rice that earthy flavour. And they have special lunch set offers (including weekends) so the dons can go as cheap as $12. 
For $18/bowl, this Donburi tasted and looked legit! The meat is done perfectly, pink in the centre, and seemingly \"melting\" into your mouth with every bite. And while they state \"truffle\", we all know that there isn\'t any in this bowl (truffles slices ain\'t cheap). The \"truffle\" sauce tasted and smell legit! It brought out the flavour of the beef nicely. The onsen egg was good, runny and soft coating the rice nicely. But the rice itself was utterly and completely disappointing. There are parts of the rice that tasted uncooked. When you chew on the rice, there bits that are tough, and even looked uncooked. Boo to the chef for not having the basic of cooking a pot of proper white and fluffy rice üòí. If not, it\'s an good and cheap alternative to the famous Fat Cow\'s beef bowl. 
But probably not this don from @tanukiraw. What\'s the hype about!
Finally visited Tanuki Raw! We had the Truffle Yakiniku Don (S$18++) from the lunch set, which consisted of an onsen tamago egg over slices of Black Angus short rib pan-seared in truffle soy sauce. Thumbs up for the short ribs which were tender, moist, and bursting with truffle fragrance. The rice, however, the quintessential component, was lacklustre and very underwhelming.
Beautifully pan seared Black Angus short rib topped with an onsen egg and seasoned with truffle soy sauce over a bowl of Japanese rice mixed with furikake. The beef slices were tender and juicy with a nice amount of fat, unfortunately the onsen egg wasn\'t runny and the taste of the truffle was not really distinct enough. How I wish I have more truffle soy sauce to splash over it. Reasonably priced at $14.80++ for the set lunch, what else can I ask for?
The beef was really tender and everything in this bowl complemented so well with each other. Would definitely go back for it again üòã The salmon one was good too, but üêÆ&gt;üêü. 
Please know that no matter how nice/good your food is, but the service is bad, no customers will return. üôÖüèª Called for the bill and was told to WAIT (in a not so nice tone) and need to remind the staffs a few times in order to get the things I want was such a turn off. üòí And it was so hard to get the staffs\' attention which I couldn\'t understand because it didn\'t seem like they were understaffed on the day I visited. \n<br />Well, it\'s not hard to find another restaurant that can serve the same standard of food.
This place seems a little over-hyped online and offline. Pretty pricey for average tasting Japanese cuisine. Looks pretty though.
After trying their truffle yakiniku donburi, I can definitely see what the fuss is about. The beef slices were cooked just right, resulting in them being super tender and juicy. The onsen egg was also perfectly runny, drenching the bowl in golden yolky goodness. The truffle aroma was quite strong, and really helped to bring all the flavours of the dish together. At $14.80 (during lunch), this was definitely worth the money and is something different from your usual chirashi dons. 
And paying $18 for this. The Yakuniru has excellent marbling and is tightly scorched - it goes nicely with the truffle Soya sauce rice. I quite like the slightly bloody taste to my beef actually. Mix the Onusen egg in for a comfy blend of textures. I do think the concept is quite novel but not drawing enough for me to come back for it again. #marshmunch #burpple
Truffle yakuniku with @hydez7 and @mandywongs after a long day at work! #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg
$20 excluding gst. Fresh and chewy! Fyi, happy hour before 8pm!
Would prefer it to be a little warm than room temperature, and I couldn\'t really taste the truffle :/ however the combination of the meal is nicely done. $18.90, is a little costly for it though
A pity the rice brought down the scores. The mix of huge sesame with very marshy rice just didnt match up with the salmon aburi. For $20.
With so much hype surrounding it, Tanuki Raw failed to live up to its expectations, at least to my expectations.
Black angus short rib that has been pan seared with a dollop of truffle soy sauce, topped with a onsen tomago egg. Sadly, our onsen egg yolk wasn\'t runny though. Overall a good eat üòã Waiting for yooooo @jaslyn_low for desserts.

Luncheon meat fries „Äã$8
Much raved about and rightly so. Overall well balanced dished. Let down slightly by the poor service but definitely will come back again 
I love how much furikae they use in their rice! Makes it super tasty. Just wish it was served hot instead of almost room temperature :(
Love their rice mixed with seaweed that is different from other places. A nice ambience place with drinks and oysters too. 
Dont under estimate this small bowl. Its rather filling. You could enjoy the truffle aroma with every bite, tho i would have prefered the rice to be served warm.
The ultimate rice bowl to get to satisfy your salmon cravings! Salmon belly sashimi, aburi + ikura w spicy mayo only at $12++. Now for the dish that is probably the most ordered at Tanuki Raw - truffle yakiniku (pan seared angus short rib with onsen egg and truffle soy)! The short ribs are fresh and perfectly done at $14.80++ &amp; Lunch is from 1130-3pm! :) 
I got the salmon bowl lunch set ($12 plus $2 for salad, green tea and miso soup). The salad initially came with yuzu dressing and I was not expecting the spice to shoot through my nasal cavity like it did. Turns out its a wasabi variant of yuzu dressing. If you love wasabi for that reason, i would suggest you try this salad with the original dressing. Otherwise, the attendant offered to get me a new bowl and swopped it for goma (sesame) dressing instead. The salmon bowl wasn\'t impressive for me. It came with salmon sashimi, aburi salmon cubes and ikura (salmon roe). These were a bit tasteless. I suspect the slightly charred seaweed rice was meant to be a twist to the dish, but it ended up to be a bit too dry for me. Adding a bit of wasabi and mixing it into the dish enhanced the flavours a little. Maybe I would try dampening the dish with a bit of shoyu the next time around. A fairly decent dish overall. 
Wasn\'t a fan of Standing Sushi Bar so I didn\'t have high expectation for this. I can\'t see how anyone can resist ordering this - plump ikura, lightly seared aburi, salmon slices and cubes, all for $12. Salmon isn\'t the freshest bordering on tasteless but the wasabi made up for it. The rice here pales in comparison to the yakiniku don but still very palatable. 
Pan seared black Angus short rib was done very nicely. Marination was really on point to enhance the flavour of the beef. I thought my beef slices were cut rather haphazardly though. The rice had a good fragrant soy base but got a bit salty towards the end. Overall a place I would return to! Lunch priced at $14.80.
|\n<br />Had heard many things (good and bad) for their lunch set. So I decided to give it a try. .\n<br />|\n<br />With their lunch time promo (12pm to 3pm), it was not a bad place to break for lunch. I love the idea of serving 3 different kinds of salmon (which portray the different textures of a salmon). However, I wouldn\'t say that this is the best raw salmon I had.  Maybe they over-chilled the salmon causing them to have this slightly mushy \"feeling\".
I was too hungry when faced with the list of dishes there and my non-working brain chose to settle with Salmon Mentaiko (despite the fact that I don\'t really like mayonnaise). Overall, the dish was not bad. Rice was rather clumpy but the strong mentaiko sauce was satisfying. I felt jelat after eating half of my dish and only finished the salmon. I don\'t think I\'ll pay as much for this dish again. On a side note, the garlic fries is good for sharing!
1. Truffle Yakiniku Don ($14.90)
Nice outdoor seatings overlooking Orchard Road. The chirachi price at 17.90 which is very decent. I would come back here again
The recently popular truffle yakiniku don from Tanuki Raw. Definitely one of the dishes to try when you\'re over here. $14.80 during lunch, you get pan seared tender Black Angus short ribs and an onsen tamago on a bed of sushi rice, seasoned with truffle soy sauce. One of the most affordable ways to pamper your tummy. 
Ordered 3 lunch bowls for 2 of us cos we were greedy and couldnt decide on what to eat. The beef bowl was so good! The combination of perfectly cooked beef slices mixed with the onsen tamago was so satisfying! The sashimi rice bowl there was alright, priced at $12 it was good enough for my sashimi fix that day!
A bowl of perfection. Beef was torched to perfection, locking its tenderness in. It was served on rice tossed with furikake and truffle oil that made it so fragrant that it was beyond imagination. The poached egg with bits of seaweed complemented the furikake rice very well:) Before I knew it, the whole don was in my tummy because I just couldn\'t stop eating it:)
The O List
Featuring Tanuki\'s Truffle Yakiniku Don which was really tasty and for that price, it\'s practically a steal! If you can\'t afford Fat Cow\'s pricier version of beef don, this is quite a good alternative.
Decent yakiniku don but disappointed with their trio of fries. Probably will revisit because of the price. 
Sis @hungrybaker had the Salmon Don ($12) which came with fresh sashimi, lightly seared sashimi and ikura, served with housemade spicy mayonnaise and yakiniku sauce. Top up $2 for a miso soup, side salad and green tea. However, I must say service here needs to be improved. Takes forever to get service staff to notice us despite the fact that there were only three tables occupied.
I quite enjoyed the Salmon Don, but the aburi was only on the edge of the fish and it was slightly strange eating raw fish on flavoured non-sushi rice. Didn\'t dare to order the chirashi after someone\'s bad review so I\'m glad this was decent for the price :)
We gotten a sake honey - mildly sweet with the taste of manuka honey. \n<br />And yes, I can\'t really drink, my head feels like its in the clouds afterwards üòÇ #burpple
The Salmon Don looked gorgeous, being presented with lovely thick slices of salmon cooked in several ways: raw and aburi. 
After so much hype about this place, I finally let myself in for the temptation. I\'m not a big fan of truffle nor angus beef. The dish was great with the rice left the most impression. I just can\'t stop imagining the grains and seasonings and seaweed all together in my mouth. Too bad, I didn\'t manage to get a place inside which explains the bad quality image I had. I think the dish is definitely a deal for $15 set lunch but not so much for $18 during dinner ‚Ä¶ hmmm might need to reconsider twice to order this again.
I love my chirashi bowls and have sampled many variations from different local restaurants throughout the years, and this was one of the worst I have ever had. The sashimi did not feel fresh, the worst offenders being the slimy scallops which smell and taste like they have been soaked in a pool of thinner mixed with yellowish pee that has been held in the bladder throughout the duration of a three hour lecture. Appalling. 2/5
Salmon sashimi, aburi, salmon roe. A salmon lover would definitely melt when you see this! Each succulent slice makes it all worthwhile! The rice was a tad bit too starchy &amp; sticky for my liking, but everything else was great! Started out as a lunch menu, the donburi is now currently on the dinner menu as well! Definitely much more worth it to come in the afternoon as they have lunch offers! 
Was really excited to try this, but I didn\'t like it as much as I wished I did. I guess what I loved most was the tender chunks of beef. 
Oysters at $2 from 5 - 8pm but my friend she would rather pay more for better oysters.
Expected chicken skewers but their rendition comes with a slab of pan-seared Teriyaki chicken that is slightly crisp on the skin but succulent for the meat. Rice was seasoned in lots of Furikake so as to induce that umami factor into the don, but the juicy and succulent mushrooms could do better for it tasted quite bland and washed out somehow.
One of the new dishes in the Donburi menu that Tanuki Raw had recently introduced for set lunch. Beef was sliced of adequate thickness; cooked to medium-well so it\'s easy to bite but retaining a bit of tension and not at all gamey, but comes with a slight smoky flavour as well as a heavy whiff of truffle which spreads in the whole bowl. Sous-vide egg was runny, and the rice was speckled in loads of Furikake so as too induce a umami flavour. Flavours are a bit heavy but portion is pretty manageable; you can also opt to add on a garden salad and green tea for an extra charge of $2++
Pleasing to the eye. About half the price of Fat Cow, and satisfaction also halved. Just an average dish but the bar makes it a pretty nice place to chill out after a long day at work. 
- \n<br />Truffle Takiniku Beef ($18) - Thick slices of beef slices with truffled oil and topping off with an Onsen Egg. So tender and good! \n<br />Heard that it\'s cheaper for lunch (
üòÅ Only during happy hours 5-8pm. Totally worth it! Tried to salvage the picture as much as possible cause lighting was extremely dim and it was hard to take pictures üò≠. #Sgfood #Foodphotography
Melt-in-your-mouth, juicy and tender pan seared short ribs mixed in with the runny onsen tamago is just so so good! I will definitely be coming back for more and the other items on Tanuki Raw\'s value-for-money lunch set menu!
$12, with fresh sashimi, lightly seared aburi, ikura with spicy mayo on Japanese rice. (Overheard people from the next table talking about how good the Tanuki Aburi roll is. Guess I shall try that the next time!)
This glorious bowl of truffle yakiniku don ($14.80) was perfectly done, tender and juicy with a beautiful onsen egg.
[$10] One my favorites at Tanuki, the breaded mozzarella cheese was done perfectly, firm and crispy on the outside and soft and sticky on the inside. üòãüç¥Wrapped within sushi rice roll, it is topped with seared salmon üòç which was finished off with a spread of Mentaiko sauce! A must try! -‚ô†Ô∏è
Beef wasnt as tender as I hoped. But it was still enjoyable, loved it with the egg. There are 3 types of salmon on the other bowl (+ ikura). I liked all! These were abt $14++ (beef) and $12++ (salmon). Given the low price, you can\'r really complain much.
Truffle Yakiniku Don ($18++)\n<br />The truffle taste is a bit overwhelming. The beef doesn\'t taste the usual beef taste.
Bara Chirashi Don ($20++)\n<br />Cubed cut version of Chirashi Don with scallop, sea beam, tuna, swordfish, salmon, striped jack and salmon roe seasoned with signature sauce served with Tamago on sushi rice. So colorful looking. Like the tasty mixture of rice + rice seasoning. Got fish floss in it.
No less popular than its sister restaurant Standing Sushi Bar, Tanuki Raw is usually known for cheap oysters and sashimi slices. In all honesty, I\'ve never really been a fan of Tanuki Raw. That was until I chanced upon the lunch sets offered by them. The Salmon Don, priced at $12, comes with slices of fresh salmon sashimi and lightly seared aburi salmon accompanied by spicy mayo and yakiniku sauce. I think it\'s a great steal. At an additional $2, you get hot green tea, miso soup and a small bowl of salad. Can\'t wait to try more items off their lunch set menu like the CHIRASHI and truffle yakiniku don! Also, the salmon don was a really great way to treat my body after countless sleepless nights due to midterms. 
Affordable lunch bowls at this bar, and I have a hard time deciding which is the best. Choose from a selection of Chirashi don with a generous portion of fresh sashimi, this mouthwatering truffle yakiniku don with a beautiful onsen egg or the tasty yakitori chicken don. All were good, and   cost less than $20 | üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
They\'ve just introduced a new lunch menu which focuses on rice bowls such as bara chirashi don, salmon don, and truffle yakiniku don (which is of course my favourite). Break the runny yolk of the onsen tamago egg over the seared Black Angus short rib with a dollop of truffle soy sauce. Only $14.80! The lunch menu is available from 11.30am to 3pm daily.
Juicy Coffin Bay oysters with a glass of crisp Sauvignon Blanc. Come between 5-8pm to enjoy them oysters at $2 each (max. 6 per order of each alcoholic drink)
Pretty darn good for a $14.80++ bowl! But I don\'t recommend finishing the rice ‚Äì that\'s super filling!
Not the best, but the rice more than makes up for it! 
Pretty decent but portions are too small for the price that we are paying üò≠ We shall come back for $2 oysters next time!
Bara chirashi and chirashi $17.80 each. Add $2 for soup salad and green tea. New set lunches at tanuki.
For an additional $2, you get miso soup, salad, and green tea. The rice is pre-tossed with an inhouse blend of furikake, pickled radish and ginger, which is a nice complement to the chicken!
$2 oysters, $7 sashimi and $10 martinis. Nothing beats happy hour here.
Daily 5pm-8pm 
Featuring special guest in this #instavideo Howard Lo, owner of Tanuki &amp; Standing Sushi Bar. U might have seen him on Singapore TV ages ago!
An indulgent Japanese-Western fusion rice bowl starring black pepper smoked duck, slices of spam and smokey streaked bacon.
Salmon, Scallop, Oyster, Prawns. You name it, we\'ve tried it. Dishes are generally different from your typical sushi chains as they are paired with ingredients that really bring out the essence of each dish. Did you even think of dried shrimps aka hae-bee-hiam sprinkled on top of an ebi fry roll?( Prawn-tastic $10) I\'d say it was my first. &amp; it was delish. More importantly, they are not stingy on their mentaiko. Do, however, watch out for peak hours. Waiting is not advised if you are easily an angry man!
Trying out modern Japanese bar. And I would almost always order Japanese curry rice. Oishii!
Winding down on a Friday with sashimi and oysters. TGIF, indeed. #tanukiraw
Supposed to be one of the must eats but I\'m not a fan. Tastes like a rice hamburger.

It\'s probably one of the better beef rice bowl that\'s value for money in town. They pan sear the US black Angus short Rib, top it with an onsen egg and truffle soy over their rice.

The angus Beef is nicely grilled and there\'s a faint char taste which just adds to the dynamics of the flavor. The rice is good too with a slightly burnt texture which somehow makes it more enjoyable. To top it up, there\'s a onsen egg which not only makes it more appealing, but also to taste more shiok too!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#donburi#ricebowl#japanesefood#angus#angusbeef#beef#onsenegg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#yakiniku#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#fusionfood#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#tanukiraw#STFoodtrending

It wasn\'t as great as I thought it would be. The short ribs were extremely salty, although each slice was rather thick. The signature rice was however rather delicious. Go easy on the salt -- that would have been a more pleasant experience.

The fries is unique and different from the usual typical fries. The sauce is very interesting and flavourful as marshmallows were included, creating new taste. would highly recommend

Fries @tanukiraw \n<br />If the trend now is to bring contrasting flavours together in a dish to challenge natural conventions and overcome stereotypes, Tanuki Raw has decided to go one step further to set up new frontiers.\n<br />The WHAM! fries is the first of many items in the menu that is poised to give you an unprecedented gustatory experience.\n<br />You have the savoury gruyere and mozzarella cheese melted over sweet potato fries and topped with marshmallows torched on the surface till its slightly soft and fluffy.\n<br />Sizeable chunks of sour cream are spattered evenly among the ingredients and finally this scrummy assortment is drenched in Tanuki\'s housemade spicy mix.\n<br />Extremely addictive and with a different flavour of sweet, sour, savoury and spicy shining through for each bite, this is indeed the more the merrier.\n<br />.\n<br />üè¢181 Orchard Road 04-01 Orchard Central Singapore 238896\n<br />.\n<br />üïöOpening Hours 11.30 am - 10.30 pm Daily\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤Damage: $11.90\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #instafoodie #cafehoppingsg #nomnom #foodstagram #singapore #igfoodies #onthetable #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #onthetable #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #whati8today #f52grams #hungrygowhere #burpple #burpplesg

Still good but rice portion is huge!
I can\'t stop popping them into my mouth! üòÑ
Our common love for chirashi, makeup and skincare shopping, movies especially Marvel movies, taking IG photos (more her than me) her kind and loving soul, her quirkiness, the list goes on. Have a safe flight Jas and I\'ll see you again soon! ...\n<br />This meal would have been the best way to compliment such a significant catch up because we genuinely liked the food and drinks but for one thing- a hard fish bone between 1-2 cm long. It\'s one of those hard bones that you can\'t bite into. I was quite shocked to find something poking my mouth when I was eating a slice of salmon. To be honest, I wanted to make a scene because this is a situation which could have gone very wrong and I know from past experience because my grandma was hospitalized for having a fish bone stuck in her throat. However, I didn\'t and as a matter of fact, informed the waiter that there was a bone in the salmon sashimi and to please tell the kitchen staff to be careful. The waiter brushed my feedback off and told me to tell the chef.\n<br />...\n<br />Taken aback by the waiter\'s blase behavior, my first thought was hello? You think I can go to the kitchen and tell the chef? Also, even if I do, how am I supposed to know who is the chef and who isn\'t? I\'m being nice enough to 1) not make a scene and 2) inform you of the fishbone so that your chef is aware and can take precautions before somebody is affected. If you don\'t want to take feedback seriously, it\'s your loss not mine if and when something happens. For those wondering, nothing happened after that because we had to rush off to other places. Good food but not impressed by the service at all.\n<br />...\n<br />@tanukibar @tanukiraw #tanukiraw #chiraishi #chiraishidon #japfood #food #foodie #foodporn #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodporn #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #igsg #sgig #igeats #sgeats #burrple #burrplesg #whati8today

FOI GRAS WAS AMAZING?!
Usually only go for the normal chirashi don because I like the big thick slabs of sashimi. But @timmeh85 was right. Bara chirashi don is easier to eat with rice üòÇ, cause I am able to scoop the right proportion of rice and sashimi when the sashimi is cut into smaller pieces. As usual, Tanuki didn\'t disappoint with a generous serving of sashimi. Onsen egg was an additional $2++. .\n<br />.\n<br />#barachirashi #barachirashidon #chirashidon #sashimi #japanesefood #eatoutsg #sgfoodporn #reversedieting #burpple #sgfoodie #whati8today #sgeats #foodiegram #foodofinstagram #iifym #instafood_sg #igfoodie #igfood #sgig

Fried yakiniku steak, avocado, tamago and bacon maki.

Yums. Fresh ingredients, big servings, what more to ask for?
I think the rice bowls are not bad
This rice bowl will send you to heaven with the onsen egg that has a runny yolk and the generous amount of black angus beef short rib that was extremely juicy and tender\n<br />This is $14.90++ and definitely worth your money. Note that they don\'t accept nets!

Fries}, this moreish dish may take a while for your palates to wrap around, but the queer mix grows on you after its slightly sweetish first impression. Call me weird, but if you avoid the unlit bits of marshmallows, the charred flavor combined with savory cheese and sweet fries are a tad addictive

Who doesn\'t like raw food that comes with a variety of awesomeness in a bowl?
BUTTT, other than that, their unique \'tanuki rolls\' is like party-in-the-mouth; very exquisite *rolling up my mustache* üò≤ #tanuki#tanukiraw#sgfood#food#japanese#japanesefood#maki#makirolls#salmon#wasabioctopus#raw#octopus#foodpornsg#burpple#8dayseatout

Sadly, sushi was underwhelming. Will have to drag her to Koh Grill/Sushi Bar. Oysters are only $2 each with purchase of alcohol üç∏ during happy hour though!! #japanese #tanukiraw #chirashi #donburi #tacos #salmon #aburi #sushi #omnomnom #dinner #fusionfood #foodporn #sgfood #onthetable #burpple
Want to try the other dishes soon üòÅ
Good value during happy hours and oysters are fresh! Cheersüç∏
The rice is seasoned so well, yummy! 
Yum yum

Trio Carpaccio. Salmon was a little fishy, tuna was alright, and yellowtail was decidedly the best. Not impressive. #carpaccio #fish #salmon #tuna #yellowtail #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Australian Coffin Bay Oysters. Freshly shucked! #oysters #aphrodisiac #raw #seafood #shellfish #sgfood #ilovemyjob #foodporn #burpple
Australian Coffin Bay Oysters. $2 each during happy hour! Fresh, but rather sandy, so eat with caution. #oysters #raw #seafood #aphrodisiac #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Go for the HH!
