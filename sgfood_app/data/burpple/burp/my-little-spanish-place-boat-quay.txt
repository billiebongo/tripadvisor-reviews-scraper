We were all so privileged to have learnt more about the different types of cured ham as well as witnessed the true art of jam√≥n carving by Owner-Chef Maria Sevillano herself. I\'m still thinking about the Coca de Cebolla from last night\'s tasting ‚Äì a crispy Catalan flatbread with onions, roasted peppers, anchovies, and lots of Manchego! Thank you, My Little Spanish Place and Burpple, for the invite!
Definitely interesting to learn the how there are different qualities to Jamon Ham yesterday which affects both the taste and texture, such as the climate and region the pigs are reared in. Pretty amazed by the knowledge of Owner-Chef Maria Sevillano on the Jamon Ham, from the origins of each type, to slicing of the ham and even identifying them after being sliced; she definitely knows her stuff!
And I saw it when Chef Maria Sevilla carefully and skillfully sliced her ham. |\n<br />Thanks for sharing all about the food you serve and its origins! It\'s great learning about what goes into your mouth. |\n<br />#MyLittleSpanishPlace #burpple
Grilled asparagus and prawns, fried egg and &amp; ‚Äúsalsa verde‚Äù. Oh look at the yolk!
White Meat Sausages and Blood Sausages platter. White Meat Sausages was a bit more subtle in flavour, but it was surprising that the Blood Sausages tasted pretty much like ordinary pork-based sausages from delis. Both sausages were firm to the bite. The hotdog lover in me just went straight on for the Blood Sausages!
Grilled prawns were plump and well-seasoned; really flavourful while coming with grilled asparagus which was savoury and crunchy. Egg yolk was flavourful when poked, and the egg was good!
Catalan Flatbread, Onions, Roasted Peppers, Anchovies and Manchego. Somewhat like a Spanish pizza, the crust was of adequate thickness and well covered in cheese, while the pizza felt rather similar to a Tuna Pizza overall.
TGIF! And if you\'re still thinking of where to go to welcome the weekends, look no further than the newly opened My Little Spanish Place at Boat Quay! Do yourself a favour and order this Coca de Cebolla when you get there. We all loved the texture of the Catalan flatbread and the lovely flavour of the Manchego cheese. Not a fan of pizza, but I definitely was in love with this coca. 
White Clams, Potatoes and Chorizo in White Wine sauce. Clams were fresh and didn\'t taste too ocean-y, while there were bits of savoury chorizo for a bit of flavour. Dip some of the bread into the tangy and warm white wine sauce spiked with a little pepper; pretty comforting on a cold day.
The one dish that got everyone excited when it was served. Who doesn\'t love clams? And the rendition here is lovely. White clams with Chorizo and potatoes in white wine is definitely a sure-win formula. I was secretly wishing for another bowl of it so I could have more!
Coca de Cebolla con Pimientos Y Anchos - spanish flatbread toast with caramelized onions, roasted peppers, anchovies and the highly popular spanish cheese - manchego. this is as close as you are in spain because they have the flatbread air-flown over! so much flavors, is a party in your mouth!
I fell in love with these fried potatoes when I first visited MLSP at Bukit Timah more than 5 years ago. They were wonderfully soft and fluffy in the middle, the edges and corners crisp in contrast, and there wasn\'t anything more perfect to dunk them in than MLSP\'s homemade garlic aioli.
Thin shavings of potato fried crispy, topped with a \"broken\" egg and bits of Jamon. Burst and mix the egg yolk around so that it binds the slices of potato together.
One of my favourite cuisines has gotta be Spanish, for their heavy usage of carbs and salty meats. Potatoes, bread, potatoes, bread, potatoes, potatoes, potatoes. YES.
While having the Albondigas de la Casa ($14+), all our thoughts were like ‚Äúwe just need ‚Äòem noodles!‚Äù Haha carb fans. It‚Äôs a fun-filled meatball with beef and pork, perfect for a tomato-based pasta. Can be paired well with the bread :)\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#reemuuheats #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #foodies #singapore #whattoeatsg #whati8todaysg #sgeats #instafood_sg #foodstagram  #meatballs #spanish #sgmakandiary #eeeeeats #nomnomnom  #foodpornsg #foodgasm #sgfoodporn #foodporn #foodagram #igsg #instaeat #spotmyfood #whattoeatph #igersph #foodieph #burpple #mylittlespanishplace
Paella de la Casa ($49+) is a freshly-cooked rice dish with prawns, squid, mussels, chicken, and chorizo toppings. The rice was said to be cooked in seafood broth, making it surely tasty. Had it shared with 2 of my friends, and was a bit short since it‚Äôs really good :p you could opt to get the larger serving at $88+. Perfect dish to enjoy in front of the Singapore River :)\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#reemuuheats #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #foodies #singapore #f52grams #sgeats #instafood_sg #foodstagram  #onthetable  #paella #spanish #rice  #foodpornsg #foodgasm #sgfoodporn #foodporn #foodagram #sgig #foodphotography #dailyfoodfeed #instaeat #spotmyfood #whattoeatph #igersph #foodieph #burpple #mylittlespanishplace

4 munchies: Who\'d have thought that a bowl of unassuming migas ‚Äì made with simple ingredients such as croutons, chorizo, tomatoes, and peppers ‚Äì would be so yummy? I loved how the oozy, soft-boiled egg added savour and texture to the pastoral first course. Do eat all the ingredients in one spoonful for a celebration of textures and authentic Spanish flavours!

Thanks for @mylittlespanishplace and @burpple for this eatup \n<br />#burpple #mylittlespanishplace
thank you for hosting for us.
Can\'t get over the presentation for this one; a smart idea to convert an entire Chocolate Tart into lollipops for easy eating. Dark chocolate ganache was rich and smooth, while the tart base was easy to bite without disintegrating into a mess.
A Spanish classic with a little twist to fit the local palette better; Migas is a traditional dish involving croutons, chorizo, potatoes, tomatoes and peppers, while this version is improved aesthetically with the addition of the poached egg. Expect earthy potato flavours and savoury Chorizo with a bit of tanginess from tomatoes and bell peppers with crisp croutons, and stir in the poached egg to make the dish a bit more smooth and silkier.
Migas was original created by sailors with \'leftovers\' on board. My Little Spanish Place has refined this dish by putting together it with croutons, chorizo, tomatoes, peppers and a beautiful soft-boiled egg. A mini treat with mega delight. Something I\'d definitely try to recreate at home!
