Good ambience, but dull lighting. Yummy food &amp; dessert! Great for sharing ~ The crepes were served warm and paired well with the vanilla ice cream. It was light and not very sweet too!
Aubergine: eggplant with miso \n<br />Shiitake: shiitake mushroom with
Famous for its don, and no doubt it\'s really good and worth it! Topped with caramelised pork loin with ginger glaze, the meat was tender and juicy with a tinge of homely taste. The sauce went well with the rice and enhanced the overall taste of the don! 
Salmon was cooked to perfection - and sauce was just right. YUMZ. 
Let\'s see... bet you\'ve been scrolling all about The Refinery\'s salted egg onion rings. 
Light and good for sharing! We had it as a starter and it whet our appetites to prepare for the dons ahead! A tad too pricey for the portion but the okonomiyaki tasted really good, plus it was served hot.
I really like The Refinery\'s space - higher ceilings, hanging hooks, the open bar concept - so great for dinner parties and such. Also, the food is really good.
We like meat. This platter of skewers included 2 each of chicken (shish kebab style), fatty pork belly, skirt steak and thick pieces of deeeelicious Wagyu ribeye (my fave). 
4.5 munchies: Deep-fried to golden brown perfection, the light batter revealed crunchy white onions with a tinge of natural sweetness. The strong-flavoured salted egg yolk custard sauce was absolutely smashing – savoury, creamy, and had the right consistency. It even comes with a small metal dish that contains more of the divine sauce – perfect for dunking in other sides like fries and cauliflower fritters! #Burpproved

For a chillout weekend brunch with friends, snag a table at this Jalan Besar hotspot. While they\'re known for their delicious rice bowls, their brunch plates are equally impressive and full on flavour, the coffee\'s great, and the vibes are breezy and laidback. Take Burppler Dex Neo\'s heed and start with the moreish Cauliflower Fritters ($10), but you\'ve been warned — the guys here spare no mercy in their stinging wasabi mayo sauce! Move on to the Double Confirm Shiok Burger ($20) that sandwiches golden brown chicken between pillowy buns (eat this quick before the bread turns soggy), or to the Chicken-Not-So-Little Waffle ($24), which Burppler Tastemaker Nobelle Liew declares to be one of the best chicken and waffles she\'s had in Singapore. The combination of savoury homemade parmesan waffles, smokey paprika fried chicken and charred generous red pepper and tomato sauce is well worth the minimum 15 minutes waiting time. Sit back, eat up and sip on a Flat White ($5) as you soak in the #weekendvibes in this high-ceilinged, light-filled space.\n<br />Avg Price: $30 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Tastemaker Nobelle Liew
Yays back at the refinery again! For brunch this time. 
Really enjoyed the intensity and taste of the coffee, recommend👍🏼 also, if ya need a place to chill or get some work place, this place is great!
Burger, truffle fries, salted egg sauce – what\'s not to love? The Refinery\'s burger satisfies the most ardent salted egg fan with an additional side of the sauce to dunk your fries or burger if you\'re still craving more. 👅💦💦
Double Confirm Shiok Burger ($20)

Hot daaaaaam... This is a great way to start a meal here at, but be warned, that WASABI MAYO packs a KICK! 😵
Flat White ($5)
I\'m no coffee connoisseur. My range of coffee ratings go from \'Mmm, I likey \' to \'Mmm, no likey\'. Good thing this one fell in the former\'s camp! 
This was rly tasty and very Kai Wei also. The battered cauliflower was seasoned with some pepper flakes/spicy seasoning and tastes amazing with the wasabi mayo which rly packed quite a punch. 
Here\'s the flat lay on both dishes. Here\'s the Unagi Donburi and Gyuniku Donburi. 🍚\n<br />•\n<br />It\'s a place that serves different kind of food, ranging from mains to sides like seaweed fries and Bedok like this, worth the visit I must say 👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />Have a Good Friday everyone!

A slice of teriyaki sauced unagi on top of steam Japanese rice. Side with pickles and wasabi. I\'m a big fan of Unagi, and the Unagi here was soft and sweet. We ordered the 72 degree egg, which makes the whole texture of the meal so gooey and warm. We loved the meal all together. 🍚🐟\n<br />▫️\n<br />Located near 🗺Lavender MRT, and priced at a decent price of ($10+) per bowl and ($3+) for the egg, the price was really worth the whole dining experience.💸🍽\n<br />▫️\n<br />The weekdays are drawing near again, are you guys excited?

The lobster was fresh and the whole thing was well-balanced.\n<br />.\n<br />Didn\'t know that The Refinery changed their menu. They still have the Beef Bowl but the portion is bigger and price is upgraded to $25. I missed the old menu when their Beef Bowl was half the price of this and half the portion. 😫 #inflation\n<br />.\n<br />Edit: their beef donburi is still available on weekdays !!
Gyuniku Donburi: $12++\n<br />(Tare Marinated Ribeye, Truffle Hon Shimeiji Mushrooms) 
Cauliflower Fritters ($10++)
3.5 munchies: The smokey paprika fried chicken was rather underwhelming – a tad dry and not at all crispy. However, what checked the boxes were the slightly chewy, fluffy homemade waffles and excellent charred red pepper and tomato sauce. Both the fresh and melted Parmesan added umami richness as well as texture to the dish.
Yummy food at The Refinery and great industrial chic setting.

-\n<br />The lunch at the refinery blew me away.

Try it!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #therefinery
Was not blown away by this :( first, the fried chicken wasn\'t juicy on the inside even though some parts were barely cooked. The salted egg yolk sauce was kinda watered down and didn\'t have that oomph. The batter for the fried chicken can also be improved to be tastier! Wouldn\'t recommend getting this.
Loved the juicy chunks of lobster on the buttery \'slow grilled\' roll!! I was so pleasantly surprised by how generous they were with the lobster chunks too. And the sauce was creamy but not overwhelming!!
Looks appealing. More truffle oil would be better but it still taste great.
Always make it a set with their agedashi tofu and coffee of your choice! Enjoyed how the onsen egg when with each strand of the noodles.
【frozen espresso ball with warm milk】3 flavors to choose from: vanilla/macadamia/praline. The praline one was delicious despite my preference for unsweetened coffee
Ordered two bowls of Dons and I\'m surprised that they are so so so filling! We couldn\'t finish what we had ordered.

Interesting combo of pull pork, meat balls, onsen egg and spicy sambal..Noodles more to the soggy side.. Pull pork and meat balls tasted decent..Sambal was so so to me.. Preferred a little sweetness to it otherwise it would just be blatantly spicy.. Nice fusion attempt but would stick to bak chor mee for the price and taste.. 6.7/10 😐
Comes with lovely runny onsen egg! Portion ideal for small eaters.. No complains other than the food was serve more towards the room temperature side.. Would prefer it warmer.. 😐
Spicy Mee with a kick - pulled pork, meatballs, onsen egg and a hell lot of spice on top of noodles. Not the faint hearted! 
It comes served with crumbles and Butterscotch ice cream at the side, and topped with candied walnuts that helps to give it some crunchiness and for a more all-rounded taste!
Thought it was weird for this to show up only after we had our mains and dessert but guessed that the kitchen got stacked up with too much orders today. These were great and sides to compliment with alcohol; the crunchiness of the soft bones went well with the crisp Tempura batter and was fried to golden-brown perfection, flavoured with garlic salt and a little spiciness from paprika. Totally addictive when you dip it into the Kewpie-esque mayo on the side.
Cinnamon Roll served with crumbles and candied walnuts, with a Butterscotch ice-cream on the side. Thought this was pretty well-scented with cinnamon flavours and crusted on the top, though the way it is baked made it lack a core in the centre. The ice-cream was decent, but the candied walnuts was done pretty well — crunchy but not too sweet without sticking all over the teeth.
Only available for weekend brunch, the Refinery Roll is The Refinery\'s answer to the lobster roll. Yet another roll that comes under $30 at $25++, it has its flaws just like how the others amongst the same price range was. Thought that the inclusion of Tobiko Roe was genius as they contributed a popping sensation with the chunky lobster meat, but the lobster meat seemed to be doused and flavoured by the in-house Japanese dressing which covered off the lobster\'s natural sweetness. The slow-grilled butter roll had a buttery fragrance but I wish they could change out for bun that is less dense, while the grilling could be more even for a more uniformed grilled crispness on the crust.
DIS WAFFLE. 😱mind blown😱
reasonably priced ($16 and below), delicious donburi bowls coupled with a spacious, wonderful and peaceful ambience. most of the things on their menu are all below $20 as well like the waffles and the seaweed truffle fries. they have a different menu for lunch and dinner and the lunch bowls are bigger than the dinner ones.
Their sides are addictively good too. I\'m in love with this place -M
Refinery Gyuniku Donburi has truffled mushroom ,marinated beef and spring onion @ 10.00 dollar ,first few bite u can taste the tender beef and juicy mushroom ,but can\'t finish whole bowl alone ,find it a bit too sweet ,we also trying their spicy ramen,refinery bowl ,unagi don ,this few dish all are below sgd 10.00 ,the ambience here was great ,good for a gang looking for reasonable price cafe and chit chat place !
We had the Refinery Bowl ($11), it has pulled pork, prickled ginger, pickled shitakes, tare, spring onions, and a lovely onsen tamago. Sweet, sour and savoury in harmony. Perfectly well balanced dish I must say! 😋
Gyuniku Donburi ($15) from The Refinery has truffled mushrooms, marinated beef, spring onions and their signature 72 degree onsen tamago. The onsen tamago adds a creamy custard-like texture to the flavourful bowl of tender beef and juicy mushroom. Every bite just made me crave for me without being too overwhelming. 😋👍🏻
Lobster roll and gyuniku donburi all too good. Need to visit again to try the bak chor mee @genevis has been raving about!
Push aside the over hyped salted egg onion rings.\n<br />The rice bowls are what people come / return for! I got this with a set. Earl Grey tea was overpowering though, with the short time it was immersed. The seaweed fried tofu was interesting.. Everything was perfect except the overdose of spring onions (personal peeve).
Love has a new face! Meet Gyuniku Donburi ($15) with his sidekick Nori Agedashi Toufu ($6 comes with iced coffee and Toufu) The secret lies in the sauce and the signature 72 degrees onsen tamago that gives it that extra texture. Well balanced, well priced.
This unpretentious Refinery Waffle, of simply sweet strawberries, pistachios, and a scoop of salted caramel ice cream, surprised me. Wasn\'t too impressed with their signature Kopi Addict last I tried, but this was 👍🏻❤️❤️❤️ waffle was STUNNING: so crisp, so fluffy, so tasty.
Buttermilk spiced fried chicken was crisp, tender, and very tasty; and the waffle - defo one of the better ones around - was fantastic on its own. Most places nail one component, but either on its own is always lacking. This though, was 👍🏻 also enjoyed the change of having marinara, though I\'m sure it\'ll be superb with the usual maple syrup too!
Onsen egg with gyu whatever donburi.This is the bomb. It tasted so good that I couldn\'t help but steal a few spoon of this from my friend\'s bowl. My friend, however, felt that the one served by Grillo over at Suntec\'s Pasarbella is better than this.
This waffle made up for the one I had the day before at Double Scoops. This was really really comparable to my favorite Creamier waffle which means it was DEFINITELY GOOD. Not too doughy, soft on the inside and just the right amount of crispy on the outside. The ice cream is super good too though it melted a little too quick. Complementing the sweetness was a little sourness of the strawberries and the nice fragrant nutty taste of the crushed pistachio generously sprinkled atop the waffle. How can one not love this? I finished it too quickly, oh man, just the way I\'d finish the waffle from Creamier. But Creamier is still my ultimate love.
Ordered this upon the recommendation of the server and all was pretty good except for the midwings which have a weird taste on the surface. The waiter told us it was a kind of Japanese sauce but I couldn\'t remember the name.
I am surprised this isn\'t a signature item because I found it superb. Besides being one of the cheaper rice bowls at $11 (before taxes), the marinated-for-48-hours piece of boneless chicken thigh was expertly grilled with a crisped skin. Serving size may not be huge but the onsen egg, shredded cabbage with a dash of light dressing and chopped spring onions all contribute to making this a rice bowl I wouldn\'t hesitate to order again.  
$15. Egg was perfectly poached and went perfectly with the flavorful beef. My favorite part was the truffle shimeji mushrooms. Good coffee is a definite plus. 
It\'s always good to encounter uncommonly-found food. Like these Brussel sprouts for instance, which I came across at The Refinery.
Vanilla waffles, crushed pistachio, sea salt ice-cream: Crispy and fluffy and a totally delicious snack.
3 espressos compressed into an ice ball, pour over with warm milk 😍
Love the skewers here! Perfect size for a quick bite between drinks.
The pulled pork was pretty average, didn\'t like the overpowering saltiness of the pork and tartness of the pickled mushrooms. The teriyaki chicken don is good! The chicken thigh was tender and flavourful, with just a touch of teriyaki sauce. Delicious with the onsen egg and white rice! Both bowls were $11++. I would recommend getting the cauliflower fritters as well to accompany your rice bowls! Love the ambiance and the space here.
I love Donburi quite a lot especially when I chanced upon a Donburi shop overseas, I would just go in to have a bowl. Highly recommendation by the refinery. This tare marinated rib-eye is served together truffle hon shimeiji. SG$10. Pretty cheap but the portion is tapas portion. I could smell the truffle before I plunge my spoon down. Perfect to add on an onsen egg for extra $3. Trust me, it\'s worth it. It will bring this dish to another level of flavors if u add that egg in! Sometimes simple food brings the most comfort.
Orange peppermint chocolate blended milkshake monster!! Ignore the whipped cream and the whole shebang and it\'s a burst of yuletide flavours that\'s actually damn refreshing. Nothing hits the spot quite like a thick, unapologetically rich chocolate shake kissed with the spice of citrus and mint
Simple, tasty donburi but honestly too little to satisfy. Then again, for a little over $10 i\'m not complaining.
It\'s a pretty good rice bowl with my pulled pork leaned more towards the Asian style (strong ginger-ish flavour). The pickled mushrooms were rather too salty for my liking but they blended well with the rice and runny onsen egg. My only reservation will be the small portion, and considering that I\'m a girl, I\'m sure a few -- if not many -- will agree with me on that. Now, all the rice bowls come with an onsen egg and thus, the increased price.
To think I almost missed this due to my dietary aspirations! While its presentation made me feel sinful, it\'s not as criminal as it looks. The gula melaka topped with ondeh ondeh excites me; the vanilla gelato and mint chocolate coconut candy indulge me; the red bean and green jelly calm me the way a cup of coffee does. Chendol Mendo, this glass of milkshake is nothing I have tasted like it. Heavenly!
Finally got to try this after listing it as one of my \"places to try\". Was quite disappointed at the dismal portion; I could probably eat 2 of these before being full. Couldn\'t really differentiate between the shrooms and the beef in terms of colour. Enjoyed the extra dimension of texture that the onsen egg provided. However, the dish lacked any truffle taste to be deemed significant. With all the hype, I hope that it was just an off day. 
Yes please! Simple, affordable comfort food hardly gets better than this. Especially with the 72deg Onsen Tamago($4.0) mixed in to make it deliciously sticky. The pulled char siew and pickled shiitake &amp; ginger… 😍\n<br />So hungry now…\n<br />#TheRefinerySG
Great value for money for this pulled pork rice bowl. They were generous with the sauce (brings me back to when Yoshinoya was cheap and full of meat and sauce 😢) and the egg was BEAUTIFUL. I love eggs. 
I\'m missing my coffee and my sweet desserts. 1 more day and we will be back to Singapore.
I love anything that has salted egg sauce. And i just had to try this. It was something different from fries. In a good way, i find. Less filling so there\'s more tummy space for the mains! I like that they are not the mashed onions inside. Really rings of onions coated in batter. And then deep fried and drizzled with that salted egg goodness. Heavenly.
So much love for this bowl of perfection. Looking at it makes me hungry again. Tender marinated chicken that is slighted charred (in a good way) in the edges, creamy corn salad &amp; that signature 72 degrees onsen egg. I wanna eat this everrrrrydayyyy.
Filling portion, tender marinated beef, truffle shimeiji mushrooms &amp; that perfect singature 72 degrees onsen egg.
I like the crunch but there wasn\'t much flavour. Didn\'t really like the dip too. But it was a good balance to the meat in our mains.
Good value for money, considering how nice the place look, the absence of service charge. Makes for a good lunch place. (Rating:😀)
The Salted Egg Onion Rings here are good but these moreish battered cauliflower florets are better (imho).  
Marinated chicken thigh with seasoned Japanese rice, as the flavour seep into the chicken it makes it more flavoursome. They pair it with a refreshing corn salad, and a 72 degree onsen egg! YUMMY~
It was quite bad. I was disappointed because I went there with high expectations after seeing good reviews about it for months:/ The quail egg which was supposed to pop in your mouth was plain bland and the star of the dish, pulled pork was really dry and hence, unenjoyable. However the portion was acceptable so it satisfied my tum but not my heart:(
If only it was better. New post on the blog and it\'s brunch at @therefinerysg. This took a good 40ish mins to come, was super dry, and the candied bacon was rather burnt. I really liked the coffee infused maple but that\'s it. Active link in bio.
loving the teriyaki chicken don rice bowl from the refinery// not forgetting the cup of flat white.☕️ #FoodInVertical

Will remove it later. But you know how you have high expectations for a place and get greatly disappointed? Not just because of the taste but because of the service as well. The taste of the diff ingredients in the refinery bowl didn\'t go well tgt. The char siew(pulled pork was tasteless, the shittake was too sour and the sauce they put on the rice didn\'t stand out either. Their gyuniku rice bowl\'s beef had too much dark soy sauce in it while the rice was too sweet. And there was no salted egg taste in their salted egg yolk dip. Worst of all, I kept wondering why everyone is served a bowl of popcorn except us. So I asked and the waitress said that the waiters were prob busy... And they were actually just standing in one row at the counter while we were eating. And there were easily more than 4 of them. This comment really irked me. It\'s not the idea of the free popcorn but the idea of customer discrimination. It made me feel like they had the time to go that one step further for every other customer except us. Did we look funny? Did we smell funny? And mind you, the place was not even half full. Ok I\'ll delete this rant later. #burpple
The Dry Ramen reminds me of what it would be like if I\'d decided to go fancy with my instant noodle suppers. Pulled pork is delicious, though it was a tad oily overall. 
Because the skirt steak (by right, not the most tender of cuts) is sliced into thin pieces, it doesn\'t come across as tough or chewy. I found the Tare marinade used pretty appealing too - similar to a sweetish BBQ and soya sauce mix. If I was to judge this rice bowl solely on the beef, I wouldn\'t score it that high but because there\'s truffle oil-laced Hon Shimeiji mushrooms and everybody\'s favourite 72 degree onsen egg, it chalks up considerably more points. The $14 price tag is reasonable for the quality and quantity as well.
The white onions within were sweet and the batter coating, thin and very crunchy. Although the mayo-like sauce wasn\'t intensely salted-eggy, it still had quite a good amount of everyone\'s favourite savoury golden orbs in there. Besides dribbling it over the rings, we were given a small bowl of the sauce too, so we could dip to our heart\'s content. Because the batter got a little greasy when it cooled off, I recommend wolfing down the onion rings while they\'re warm.
Cola-Infused Pull Pork with Togarashi Mayo and Pink slaw, all wrapped in the Golden Slider Buns. Making it simply finger licking good. #eatwithzac
Hope to see you soon bro \"Gangsign\" you know I know 😏
Salted egg yolk sauce. On onion rings. In a Chinese takeout box. I know, it seems like a triple mismatch, but in all reality, it\'s a triple slam dunk. Savory, rich and creamy salted egg yolk (an extra helping of which was also served in a small sauce dish, so extra credit to the Refinery for that one) perfectly compliments crispy, light yet full-flavored onion rings that sit innocently in an inconspicuous Chinese takeout box. Now I know why everyone loves it, and I know I gotta get me a second helping soon.
The Refinery Bowl ($8, additional $4 for an onsen egg) emulates Manny Pacquiao quite well. It may be small in size, but it packs a whopper of an uppercut in terms of flavor. Well seasoned and melt-in-your-mouth-tender pulled pork, combined with perfectly steamed rice dripping with savory sauce, this bowl was so delicious and umami words just fail to describe it. But wait, there\'s still the perfect, velvety onsen egg that puts this dish on par with the mythological legends of old! Well I\'ve done it, I\'ve just sold myself into coming back here for more.
A relatively small serving of a very very delicious beef rice with a tomago to top it off. 👍👍
Nice tender wagyu... My son said it\'s good. Service is definitely good.
Mmmm... Just like normal sticks of scallops. I thought I saw Mentaiyaki instead.
Nice tender meat with these rice. The sauce was a little salty.
I love the onsen egg and pulled pork, goes so well with the Japanese rice especially the flowing egg yolk :D Together with it was also mushrooms which I think had a tinge too much vinegar. Nonetheless, overall a good experience :)
Listened to my inner devil\'s cajoling and got this Salted Egg Onion Rings (S$8+) - and lucky I did! The crispy thin batter encased a ringlet of soft cooked onion (none of that mushy fast food crap), topped with a drizzle of thick and rich salted egg sauce. It\'s pretty damn sinfully delish. Only gripe was the sauce ended up a little too sweet, especially when all the donburi dishes feature sweet marinades.
Good food\'s very much like a great cocktail (I don\'t know how effective this analogy is lol) where balance is key. A balance between flavours and textures helps you get the most from a dish.
Yes you heard me right. If you haven\'t tried this then you should! You won\'t regret. \n<br />#shutupandtakemymoney
The Gyuniku Donburi (S$14+) was a decently priced rice bowl served with truffled hon shimeji shrooms, tare marinated skirt steak, spring onions, and an onsen egg. The rice and egg were cooked perfectly, and the strong truffle-scented mushrooms turned out light and very palatable. Unfortunately the crux of the dish disappointed. The marinade was way too sweet, and when liberally drizzled over everything, caused every bite to resemble mouthfuls of sweet sauce. It overpowered everything, honestly tasting a little gross after awhile. Tone down on the sweet factor and this\'ll be way better.
Say it really fast and you might get something else 😂 Strawberry pokkie flavour somemore.
Restaurant, bar and studio, these three storeys pack in one cool crowd, and a surprisingly tiny kitchen. On their lunch menu, find popular donburi options like the Refinery Bowl ($10) with super tasty pulled pork, the Gyuniku Donburi ($14) with truffle-kissed shimeiji mushrooms and tender tare marinated steak, and the Teriyaki Chicken Don ($10). Each rice bowl comes topped with their oh-so-sexy 72 degree egg. If you\'re there as a group, order starters to share; both the Cauliflower Fritters ($10) and Salted Egg Onion Rings ($12) are unforgivingly moreish! For dinner, the dons come in ‘small bowls’ (from $6) instead, maybe so you can dedicate space for their tasty selection of skewers. With plenty of chow options, this is the perfect spot to unwind after work with ice-cold beers.
The menus available for lunch is pretty different from dinner and worth making another visit. Shown here are The Refinery Bowl ($10), Teriyaki Chicken Don ($10), Gyuniku Donburi ($14) and Salted Egg Onion Rings ($12).
The Gyuniku bowl ($8) needs no introduction as its tender soft beef and savoury sauce had already won many hearts through their lunch menu. The cauliflower fritters ($10) balanced the meal well for me as a broccoli/cauliflower avid lover which I love the wasabi mayo accompanying it but for the batter wise, paddyhills rendition won my heart 😊
At $14, you can enjoy an oozing tamago with fragrant truffle Hon Shimeiji mushrooms and large slices of tender beef from The Refinery. The tare marinated skirt steak was sweet and succulent so mixed together with their signature 72 degree onsen egg it further enhanced the savouriness of the entire dish.
Throwback to dinner two weeks back where I visited this lovely restaurant with @lilychonglily. We tried the recommended skewers - Shiok Bak ($10) and Aubergine ($6), Refinery Bowl ($6), Salted Egg Onion Rings ($12), and their special Yuzu Mojito ($18)
The captivating scent of coffee lingered in the air, emanating from the dark-hued waffle that had arrived. Our conversation paused momentarily, and expectations instantly rose.
\"This place looks just like one of those trendy cafes in Melbourne\", the gf quipped as we sidled towards one of those wooden tables on the ground floor of this multi-concept joint. The high ceilings and clean, white-washed walls adorned with quirky Japanese-inspired murals channel a chillax vibe while managing to be painfully hip at the same time.
Nowadays, you can \"salted egg\" just about anything and everything. It\'s addictive flavour has gotten us so enamoured that we fall prey to these newfangled creations every.single.time.
Gyuniku Donburi. Salted Egg Onion Rings. Flat White. \n<br />And a whole buncha other things not pictured cause I don\'t want to look like a pig 🐷 \n<br />The Refinery is a hip, industrial looking spot that\'s great for an evening hangout. The rice bowl was tasty but lacked generosity and the onion rings were lovely when coated with the salted egg cream but started to fall flat when left out too long. \n<br />#fatdieme #foodporn #whyidonthaveabs #bodyplump #therefinery
The chicken thigh was marinated for 48 hours then sous vide, and it shows with how tender and flavourful it was. The creamy corn salad was nothing special and I could have done without it.
Nary was there ever a more perfect match than mushroom and beef. Hon Shimeiji mushrooms\' earthiness further accentuated with the perfume of truffle oil, perfectly complementing the bite sized slices of succulent and slightly sweet Tare marinated skirt steak. Also, obligatory praise for 72 degree onsen egg - \"such wobble, so oozy, wow.\"
My first time here, and the waitress was accomodating enough to switch me to a table of my choice after having being seated, even without prior reservations. The interior screams industrial chic with high ceilings, glass, wood, black oil barrels and high windows letting in natural light. I ordered the Gyuniku Donburi while my friend got the Teriyaki Chicken Don. Both tasted good and had well prepared ingredients with the exception of the rice being undercooked. Reasonably priced and value for money, I will be returning to try more items for sure.
Fact: salted egg is the new bacon. Salted egg makes everything taste better. EVERYTHING. This was all I hoped for and more. The onion rings were encased in a beautifully crunchy golden brown thin batter that shatter resoundingly as you bite down. It\'s accompanying salted egg yolk custard sauce had the right balance of salty, tart and sweet. I only wish there had been more of it. Share with at least 2 friends as it can get quite filling.
The selling point was the 72degree onsen egg which made me tempted. The pork was delicious that it really doesn\'t need the egg. Tge mushroom had its own tasteful flavors. I hated myself for mixing everything together because you lose its individuality.
The marinade might be marmite because it was distinct. Crispy but it was too heavy on the marinade.
Saw this cafe on Burpple and my heart was so tempted to pay a visit. Though highly recommended, this beer grub came out cold. We were the only patrons so most likely it had been left on the counter for quite sometime. Of thw timing to serve was perfect, I would have enjoyed this dish.
A scrumptious bowl of well-marinated pulled pork and mushroom donburi. It looked like a rather small bowl, but it was sufficient, and for once I polished off the entire portion of rice because it was so good! Making plans to go back again 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Definitely a must-try at The Refinery, the Salted Egg Onion Rings can be seen ordered by almost every table. Crisp and served hot, the battered onion rings are surprisingly sweet which goes really well with the salted egg yolk custard sauce and if the sauce is insufficient you can ask for more!
A satisfying rice bowl consisting of very tasty pulled pork, pickled ginger and shiitake, spring onions and that oh-so-sexy signature 72 degree onsen egg.
Great if you love onion rings, but I don\'t. The sauce is quite kickass. So it will go with a lot of other stuff. #burpple #therefinerysg
Yesterday\'s latte from The Refinery hit all the right notes in my tired body. \n<br />How do you guys get by your tiring day/week?
Awesome food, impeccable service from the lady staff.
This biscuit like hollow waffle took a good 45mins to be ready, after my friends finished their noodles and don. -insertbitchface- 😒
Gyuniku Donburi ($14+) from #therefinerysg lunch menu, simple &amp; good!
This wonderful bowl of goodness hit all the right notes for me. Truffle Gyuniku Donburi boasts Truffle Hon Shimeji Mushrooms, Tare Marinated Skirt Steak and their signature 72 Degree Onsen Tamago sprinkled with spring onions.
Pulled Pork, prickled ginger,  pickled shiitakes, tare,  spring onions and that oh so sexy signature 72 degree onsen tamago 
Can\'t stop popping those in my mouth! But sadly, the truffle taste was really vague and slightly non existent,  probably covered but the stronger seaweed taste. #tgif
($10.70) The main aspect of this Don was the teriyaki chicken which felt really good as compared to the normal teriyaki chicken that we normally have. There was no sauce and the teriyaki flavor was imbued into the chicken itself. Particularly liked the chicken skin too, however the onsen egg was just fanciful and wasn\'t really having much flavor other then being a normal egg to the Don, corn was pretty average too. Looking at their manpower at lunch time I would say that it is best to only go there where the crowd isn\'t that huge. 
Essentially hipster Myojo Ramen Char Mee 100, with bak chor mee pork balls and sweet but viciously mauled Narcissus spiced pork cubes. The relatively vacuous mee required vigorous mixing - otherwise you get the lovely taste of kosong instant noodles - so appreciate and seize the calorie-burning opportunity. 3.4/5
I had travelled all the way to The Refinery to try their Kopi Addict Waffle (coffee waffle, candied bacon, butterscotch gelato, and 24hr coffee-infused maple syrup), but my order was incorrectly keyed in. Unfortunately, it did not occur to me to check the receipt, especially given the long queue behind me and the place being packed to the rafters during the Friday lunch hour. When I pointed out that my order was incorrect, I was simply directed to my receipt. \"Lan lan suck thumb\", etc. 
The infamous version with quail egg. Still delicious! Will be back again. 
Current Lunch Situation: Truffle Hon Shimeiji and Tare Marinated Skirt Steak Rice Bowl with Onsen Tamago. I love the generous serving of beef and that glorious 72°C poached egg.
The fermented bean sauce is makes you salty till damn shiok! Not my cuppa tea but those who can take ultra salty food would appreciate it I guess 😂😂 #AldoraEats\n<br />#TheRefinery #ShiokBak
Not too strong coffee. Interesting waffle combination! Aeiou is just two ships down!
$6, from The Refinery. This was pretty good. Juicy onion rings, crispy batter coated with salted egg sauce. Doesn\'t feel too oily. Mum complained that it was salty (BUT IT\'S SALTED EGG!!) and ok la a bit gelat towards the end. But still good.
This Kopi Addict Waffle ($16+) is a locally-infused rendition of your normal waffles, as the combination of a coffee waffle, candied bacon, a scoop of butterscotch gelato presents a balanced taste between sweet and savoury! The coffee taste is enhanced by the waffle itself and the coffee-infused maple syrup! The candied bacon, though dry, is sweet and savoury.
Don\'t get me wrong; this waffle was in fact rather good, but the coffee addict in me just did not get convinced. Waffle base was in fact sturdy with crisp, without being hollow in the middle, and the ice-cream had strong vanilla accents and maple syrup felt pretty premium too without a stinging aftertaste, while bacon was crisp though a bit similar to bak-kwa. The only thing wrong was how it came deviating so much from our expectations; the 24 hour coffee-infused maple syrup and Butterscotch Gelato promised in the menu seemed to lack in the taste aspect as we could not detect any cue of the additional flavours within, and the Coffee Waffle though existent was rather light in flavour and overpowered by the eggy and buttery waffle which was still tasty, but lacked the surprise element.
The salted egg craze lives on and even brought itself as a dip to onion rings! Onion Rings were crisp, though the onions seemed to strip themselves off the batter whenever you bite it somehow. Salted egg bits were detected at the top, which enhanced the flavours of the savoury yet creamy salted egg yolk dip at the side. Curry leaves could do with some frying before being served; a tad unchewable which made it seem as though it was there just for aesthetics.
Came here wanting to try their western-style grub for brunch but they had changed their menu two weeks ago featuring more Japanese dishes. Despite the initial disappointment, this Donburi rose up to the occasion with its generous amount of ingredients; Truffle Hon Shimeiji Mushrooms, Tare Marinated Skirt Steak, Spring Onions and 72 Degree Onsen Tamago which proved to be a mind-blowing combination. Light truffle aroma flavours up the subtly earthy mushrooms which were chewy and juicy, with buttery hints detected, and the beef despite being all sliced up was pretty savoury, cooked with sweetly caramalised onions. Break the flowy yolk and mix in all the ingredients and a umami flavour shines through. Screw the other don places that tries too hard; this is the don that you cannot don\'t try, especially when it\'s $14 a bowl excluding GST (they do not charge service charge).
Ordered Refinery Bowl and this Salted Egg Onion Rings. A bit salty and soggy cos of the sauce but it was alright.
pretty chill place and simple but tasteful decor/furniture! we had their ultimate platter, kaki fry, spicy mee, mee pok, poutein and salted egg onion rings (not in picture)
A casual yakitori restaurant on the first floor, cocktail bar on the second, and craft workspace on the third, The Refinery is pushing the boundaries of what it means to be 3-in-1. Grab some \'Shiok Bak\' or skirt steak skewers to go with the Refinery rice bowl, or go for some onion rings smothered in salted egg yolk custard sauce go to with that pint. For the creatives in search of a studio, their workspace on the third floor is open to enquiries. This place is set to pack in one cool crowd.
Skirt Steak ($8 for 2 skewers)\n<br />24 hours marinated beef skirt steak, rich &amp; fragrant yellow pear &amp; soy marinade with aromatics, grilled till tender, served with roasted garlic purée or honey whole grain mustard. Tastes a bit raw in the middle, but well marinated. Guess it is served middle raw.
Refinery Rice Bowl ($6 per bowl)\n<br />Flavourful Japanese Rice, slow-cooked and shredded pork collar with a brown sugar glaze, signature 1 minute \"Onsen\" egg, soy &amp; sherry pickled ginger, topped with Tare sauce.\n<br />Although most of the items taste quite salty on their own, but when we\'ll mixed together, it actually tastes quite flavourful and nice.
Shiok Bak ($6 for 2 skewers)\n<br />Dry cured then traditionally roasted pork belly slab, moist and tender meat, crispy crackling skin, served with house-made fermented bean curd sauce &amp; roasted sesame seeds.\n<br />Felt not crackling enough and fat not melt in the mouth type.
Shiok cup of coffee in such weather!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple  #wishuponatart_eats

The thick fluffy omelette filled with tender bacon strips, fresh juicy shrimps and crunchy beansprouts (swipe once to view the interior; pardon the messy outlook though🙈) surprisingly exceeded my expectations, despite its simple outlook. Coupled with a pleasant savoury tinge of saltiness from the pork floss and Worcestershire sauce, the overall combination was impressive and satisfiying to the palate. Great for sharing as a side or suffice as a main if you are dining alone. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice #TheRefinerySG

There is a reason why the Beef Gyudon with Foie Gras at the Refinery is known as the Epic. \n<br />Premium ingredients such as truffled hon shimeiji mushroom paired with the meltingly tender thin sliced rib eye and deluxe foie gras that is pan seared till a caramelized crust is formed on its surface. \n<br />Add in the 72 degrees onsen tamago and leave the gooey yolk to blend luxuriously with the tantalizing dark sauce to elevate the overall flavour of the beef bowl.\n<br />.\n<br />🏚115 King George\'s Ave, 01-02\n<br />.\n<br />🕚Opening Hours:\n<br />Lunch\n<br />Tue - Fri  12.00pm - 3.00pm\n<br />Dinner\n<br />Tue / Wed / Thur 6.00pm - 12.00am\n<br />Fri / Sat  6.00pm - 1.00am\n<br />Brunch\n<br />Sat / Sun  11.00pm -4.00pm\n<br />Closed Mon\n<br />.\n<br />💲Damage: $25\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #instafoodie #cafehoppingsg #nomnom #foodstagram #singapore #igfoodies #eatclean #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #yummy #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #whati8today #openrice #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg
But fret not, be prepared for it by getting the signature iced coffee ball comprising the flavorsome essence of vanilla and espresso.\n<br />Serve it with warm milk and be in awe of the intricate defrosting of the iced coffee ball. \n<br />The resulting concoction is rich and slightly acidic with a sweet lingering aftertaste.\n<br />It will be your saviour to counter the after meal sleepiness.

Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy within and each bite is delightfully appetising.\n<br />Dip it in the sharp and intense wasabi mayo for an instant rude awakening of your senses while the squeeze of lime will provide the zest and tartness to the overall flavour.

One of the other one we ordered was the Gyuniku Donburi, which was a 👍🏻👍🏻 on @therefinerysg Menu. 😱\n<br />•\n<br />The Gyuniku Donburi consisted of truffle hon shimeiji mushroom, deep fried garlic and Tate marinated rib-eye. Everything about this dish smells perfection. Yum👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />@therefinerysg is located near Lavender MRT. This bowl cost ($12+). Remember to add additional 72 degree egg for just ($3+). 🤗\n<br />•\n<br />Let\'s stay happy everyone!

It’s a flavoured Espresso Ice Ball served with warm milk. At $8.50 a pop, it’s kinda pricey for just a (small) cup of coffee. But, the coffee gets really strong as it melts in the warm milk and it does have the undertone taste of whichever flavour it is (mine’s praline). #therefinerysg\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#syxxeats #coffee #coffeetime #coffeegram #coffeeholic #drink #icecoffee #latte #brunch #burpple #cafe #cafesg #cafehopping #chill  #foodphotography #instafood #nomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #singapore #yummy #sogood #latergram #igdaily #instadaily #instafollow

Price: $12 + $3\n<br />•\n<br />🚇: lavender \n<br />•\n<br />Located underneath a quiet office building, thus making it an ideal for dates or just a chill out with Friends.\n<br />•\n<br />As for the food, When the Donburi came, I could smell the fragrance of truffle. The truffle is mixed with the Hon Shimeiji Mushroom therefore giving it a chewy texture. The tare marinated Rib eye was sweet and when mixed with the mushroom... It was just delicious! I even wanted to order a second bowl! \n<br />•\n<br />The 72 degree Onsen Tamago was an extra bonus. I mixed the egg with my rib eye, making it so smooth as if it could slip down my throat. I also believe the egg further enhances the sweetness of the beef. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />Overall, I had a great experience at the refinery. I will definitely be back to try their brunch and lunch menu too.\n<br />•\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #sg #sgfood

The menu description reminded me of Kin Kin Dry Chilli Pan and to be frank, it did not differ much in appearance and taste - as déclassé as this may sound. Don\'t get me wrong, I love the Kin Kin Pan Mee a great lot, so this was utterly delicious to me - the curly noodles were springy in texture (aka \"QQ\"), the chilli was substantial so flavours exploded deliciously in the mouth; the pulled pork strips were tender and saccharine in flavour. The onsen egg was tossed evenly into the noodle adding a velvet touch as well as sweetness to the dish - even for a carbo-avoider like me, I kid you not when I tell you I finished every single bite of this dish.
The battered onion rings were crispy and one could easily spot the generous strips of onion within the rings; however the salted egg flavour was light to non-existent. Maybe it wasn\'t dipped with the salted egg before being deep-fried, since the Salted Egg Custard was served on a separate side saucer? We doused it over the onion rings and could thereafter taste the creamy salted egg coating.
Good coffee, wonderful conversation, great company...loads of fun.

Teriyaki don that worth the wait for 30mins that\'s come with a 70 degree charred chicken and a Benedict egg. Spicy Mee that seems like \"minced meat noddle\" that\'s is spicy enough For the buddy to feel hot afterwRe. And the highlight, salted egg onion rings.. It\'s kinda of disappointment coz the rings r nt crispy and the salted egg is too milky.

While its presentation made me feel sinful, it\'s not as criminal as it looks. The gula melaka topped with ondeh ondeh excites me; the vanilla gelato and mint chocolate coconut candy indulge me; the red bean and green jelly calm me the way a cup of Flat White does. Chendol Mendo, this glass of milkshake is nothing I have tasted like it. Heavenly!

Pretty average. #therefinery @therefinerysg #pork #belly #cafehop #cafe #cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafes #foodporn #igsgstyle #sgfoodie #sgigfoodies #foodreviewsg #singaporeinsiders #Instadaily #igsg #sgig #instasg #instagramsg #style #eatoutsg #burpple
But aren\'t that\'s what a good place suppose to be? The owner &amp; crew had put in efforts to create an environment &amp; atmosphere that can even affect the customers mood and make everything feel good and making having a meal there enjoyable? Make a trip down but beware of the lunch horde! Lol!
Hmm..... there are #waffle, #strawberrycheesecakeicecream, #pistachio &amp; #strawberries. Oh! It is the #refinerywaffle ! Well...compared to the great waffles places out there, it does need quite a fair bit of works in order to match up to them but it suffice for a after meal dessert. Waffle are rather crispy but not airy and the ice cream is quite run-off-the-mills stuff. Not bad but nothing truly outstanding.
They are using more milk here &amp; thus has a lighter coffee taste to it.
The #teriyakichickendonburi ! It is a simple but very well done donburi. Love the perfectly done #onsentamago which the dark soy sauce! The teriyaki chicken is not overly sweet or dried. Very enjoyable!
Ended up ordering the #saltedeggonionrings instead. Find that they over fried the rings with them being slightly charred &amp; oily but it was redeemed by the nice salted egg yolk custard sauce which has a slightly thick consistency but light salted egg yolk taste.
Brunch at #therefinerysg ! No wonders why @otknpr dragged me out from my weekend \"beauty\" sleep to have brunch here! This is the latest place in Singapore to be at and be seen! After you were here, you got the boasting rights to say you had been to the most hip &amp; coolest brunch location currently in Singapore! Big, spacious, hip, good food, drinks &amp; happening crowd. What more can you ask for?! Lol!
So... Who eats waffles and ice cream for lunch?
Good vinegar, nice chilli oil, nicely braised pull pork, succulent mushrooms and a quail egg to die for. Overall a good attempt at mimicking ramen, but ramen was severely lacking in flavour. Being a dry ramen. There wasn\'t \n<br />enough punch. @therefinerysg #therefinery \n<br />#cafehop #cafe #cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafes #foodporn #igsgstyle #sgfoodie #sgigfoodies #foodreviewsg #singaporeinsiders #Instadaily #igsg #sgig #instasg #instagramsg #style #eatoutsg #burpple #FoodForFoodies #Foodies #Instafood #Foodstagram
