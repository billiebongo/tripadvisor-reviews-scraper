Can you believe that my first ever visit to \"The Populus Coffee &amp; Food Co.\" only took place earlier this week? Unlike how it is on weekends, the cafe was not crowded at all when I strolled in at 10am on a Tuesday. \n<br />Deciding what to have was tough as I was tempted by quite a number of items on their menu. Eventually, it was \"The Populus Scramble\" that won.\n<br />I have to say, this signature dish deserves its popularity and must-try status. The scrambled eggs, executed to slightly runny creaminess, was chockfull of marinated feta cheese, fresh herbs and even a few small slices of red chilli. It\'s served attractively piled on a large, very crispy, buttery croissant and topped with a few slices of bacon. \n<br />In terms of portion, \"hearty\" would be the word I\'d use. The fact is, I struggled to finish all of it.

Seafood linguine...not bad, but I think it can be better...
Second time having it and I\'m proud to say that the quality is consistent! The Wagyu was tender pink on the inside and the truffle further amplified the flavour. I seem to be a sucker for any truffle and wagyu combination üòÇ
Have always dislike grain bowls \'cause I\'m the least healthy person out there. But as age catchs up, one can\'t afford to eat chicken wings for every meal and expect the waistline to miraculously not increase. The grain bowls here proved that healthy eating need not necessarily be a pain. Do give it a try!
Pricy but worth the money! Would totally go back for more!
Not as pleasing as the Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl, but healthy.
$18.50. Scrambled eggs. One of the fluffiest and richest among sg cafes. Huge love.
If you like crab cakes fully of that crabby freshness and crispy breaded crunch, look no further as Populus has absolutely nailed it with this side dish which for some reason has been inconspicuous on its menu. It was so good I could not resist taking a pic every time I break open one of these crab nuggets, all moist and fresh inside and crispy outside, only to find the couple across the table whispering: \" what is that? I want...\"
Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($19.50+)\n<br />You might think grain bowls don\'t fill you up but this was SOLID! The pulled pork was on the dry side, but everything else was delicious &amp; roasted to good texture &amp; flavour.
Located across Pinnacle @ Duxton (nearest MRT is Outram MRT Station), this gorgeous cafe decked out in hexagonal marbled tiles, rose gold finishings and modern wood panels serves tasty brunch items that we would definitely return for. Seats fill up pretty quickly on weekends, so swing by early with your friends. You must order the crowd favourite Populus Scramble ($17.50) that sees creamy scrambled eggs and feta chunks stuffed into a buttery croissant, spiced with sliced red chillies. Don\'t be fooled by the compact portion size, which belies how filling the combination is. For something healthier, go for the Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($18), one of three grain bowls available. It\'s our favourite of the lot, considering how tender and well-seasoned the meat is. Served with a trio of quinoa, bulgur wheat and pearl barley, the well-balanced and nutritious bowl also comes loaded with lots of vegetables like mushrooms, tomatoes and pumpkin. End your meal with one of their excellent coffees made with a house blend of beans from El Savaldore, Guatemala and Brazil. If you like your coffee milky but strong, go for their Magic ($5.50). If not, ask the friendly baristas for recommendation on their Filter Coffee (from $6)!\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hilary See
Populous scramble $18.50 \n<br />Perfectly seasoned and creamy scrambled eggs, the \'fold\' kind. Crispy multigrain toast. Nothing to fault but abit ex leh.
Interesting toppings! High tea with temp job friends this aftn. It has been 8 years! And 2 years (?!) since we met up!! üòä #populussg #burpple
It tasted more like a banana cake to me though! #populussg #burpple
Thai curry has a big influence on new item on Populus refreshed menu. The whole chicken thigh is roasted and not really stewed in the curry, unexpecting but different in a good way. The curry stew has lots ingredient such as tomato, potato, carrots, zucchini and edamame. Served with half a Turkish bread, which I was very tempted to ask for the other half, to soak up all the curry in the bowl, that would have been my legitimate reason. Satisfying alternative to brekkie options.
Populus Cold Brew ($4)
Spring onion &amp; corn pancake, signature crispy succulent fried chicken thigh fillet, hint of cumin, house special ranch dressing
This dish had me at heirloom rendang (okay, maybe the recommended icon on the menu too üòÖ) and I\'m really glad I ordered this. 
The only thing I enjoyed was the fried chicken. The pancake had cumin in it, thus tasted like an Indian dish. And I didn\'t expect the corn to come in kernels, thought it would be mashed up within the pancake flour #populuscafe #burpple
It was a lot of flavours in a bowl. Give it a try!
Signature soft creamy scrambled eggs, fesh herb melange, marinated feta, streaky bacon, toasted croissant
Despite new competition sprouting along Neil Road and Everton Park, this cafe decked out in beautiful tiles and classy rose gold furnishings is holding its ground with satisfying mains and good coffee. While the menu at Populus Coffee and Food Co. features a good list of delicious mains like the Rendang Donburi ($20), it also has a small section dedicated to healthier grain bowls that is easy to miss. Of the three bowls available (all have the same vegetable toppings but different proteins and bases), we enjoyed the Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($18) the most. The meat is tender and well-seasoned, sitting on a bed of quinoa, bulgur wheat and pearl barley, and lots of vegetables like mushrooms, tomatoes and pumpkin. It is a well-balanced, nutritious bowl that will fill you, and is available throughout the week for both lunch and dinner. Swing by for a quick lunch with colleagues, or come in the night with your friends and catch up in this cosy space. \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Kat Tay
For those who want to eat healthy yet don\'t want to sacrifice flavour, these grain bowls are for you. Set on a bed of quinoa, bulgar wheat and pearl barley mix, the well-seasoned and extremely flavourful proteins (i love the pulled pork the best) are served alongside yummy side ingredients like furikake baby corn (LOVE!), red cabbage and apple slaw, roasted zucchini, roasted butternut squash, sauteed cherry tomatoes and mixed mushrooms. Yummo. 
Looking for something tasty and yet healthy? This is the place to be!ü§ó\n<br />Recommend the pulled pork grain bowl @ $19.50üç¥
Roast chicken grain bowl with lots of veggies. The plate was surprisingly good.
Feasted too much and tried to order something \'light\', or so I thought.\n<br />\'Scrambled eggs on croissant\' and truffle fries sounded kinda mild right? Wrong, they were huge and so my hubb and kiddo ate them instead!\n<br />Love big portions nonetheless üòç\n<br />Lovely tea, too üéÑüéâ
Chilled buckwheat soba noodles, crunchy edamame, marinated mushrooms, pickled microgreens, and a sweet salty roasted cod loin that is beautifully oily.
Soft chewy spring onion and corn pancake, stacked with succulent chicken thigh, coated in a crisp, house special spice batter.
Smooth, light, and refreshing, this cool brew has a medium acidity. Sweet then bitter with a short finish.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />The Populus\n<br />146 Neil Road
Doesn\'t look like much, but this plate of al-dente pasta and fresh seafood is outstanding.
Utterly delightful and vibrant meal.
Made with coffee beans from the farm of Francisco Antonio Castillo David, in the La Paz region of Honduras.
Strawberry &amp; Elderflower Sundae ($14)
Cod was lightly seasoned and blended well with overall dish though it did taste a tad overdone. \n<br />With one interesting Gibraltar coffee drink which really is a flat white with less milk. #weekendtreats #burpple #cafehunting
Had the 2 recommended items and while they are all pretty good, the grain bowl had me wanting more. A taste reminiscent of Mediterranean food and makes me miss exchange days in Europe ^^
Look at those amazing colours! The Peranakan achar, Japanese plum pickles, Vietnamese carrot, purple cabbage &amp; radish pickles. Goes really well to bring down the jelat-ness of the beef Rendang.
Overall a fluffy nice pancake, though the toppings could be more to balance the bite as the pancake is relatively thick. 
The cut chilli and dill cuts the richness of the scrambled eggs, making it pleasantly easy to eat without feeling jelat. 
I had the roast chicken grain bowl ($18+), which had roasted zucchini (2 pieces üòí), sauteed cherry tomatoes, mixed mushrooms, butternut squash, cabbage and apple slaw on a bed of wild and brown rice. Extremely filling and satisfying! I mixed everything together a la bibimbap and it was delicious. The other item in the picture is their rendang donburi (beef rendang with Japanese rice). Judging from how clean my friend\'s bowl was, it should be delicious as well üòÇ.
I SINCERELY MISS MY CAREFREE DOG DAYS, where I can go cafehopping errday.
@thepopuluscafe \n<br />Happy eating, take a break and have a perk-me-up cuppa... #thepopuluscafe #tanjongpagar
Strawberry &amp; Elderflower Sundae with buttermilk waffles (+$5 for the waffles). absolutely pretty and yummy. cold ice cream with warm crispy waffles. üëçüèªüëçüèª perfect for warm SG weather ‚òÄÔ∏è~
Very fluffy and thick buckwheat pancake! But it gets very heavy fast and the smear of berry compote is negligible. More maple syrup and berries would make it more palatable. The cornflake crumb added a nice crunch to the otherwise one dimensional texture. But again, too little. At $19.50++, I won\'t recommend this.
Croissant was crispy and buttery! But the dill scrambled eggs didn\'t complement well. I may be a little biased but I feel dill should be used sparingly. The dill here overpowered the eggs and the feta cheese, with the chilli adding a strange spiciness, sort of like eating a spicy tartar sauce. Also, the over cooked scrambled egg was pretty much a deal breaker considering the hefty price of $18++.
Sticky Date Pudding ($13) didn\'t quite hit the spot, albeit its softness and moist, the pudding lacked the flavor and fibrous texture of dates, and was too sweet to be paired w the pool of butterscotch sauce. Still, really good vanilla ice cream that made it better! On a mission to find the best date in sg, I mean, sticky date pudding

It\'s FriYAY! üéâ How about having some Buckwheat Pancakes ($19.50) to end the week on a good note? These pancakes aren\'t your usual type, it had a \"banana bread\" kinda look on the inside, but definitely fluffier and less dense than banana bread. It was also thicker than normal pancakes. Very unique! This dish is probably known for its presentation, it really looked so pretty I couldn\'t peel my eyes off! Don\'t think I would been able to finish it by myself because it was pretty filling. Sadly, a lot of damage done on my wallet for just one pancake! üò≠ I also hope they improve the lighting of the place because that hand shadow, just no.
Starting off with a nice brunch at @thepopuluscafe and capping it off with the dark chocolate sundae. Nice catching up with @yiyangk as well.
Roasted cod loin, soba noodles, marinated mushrooms, lightly pickled vegetables, broad beans, lime &amp; sesame dressing (Delivered by @Deliveroo_SG)
Best pancakes we\'ve tried yet - portion is perfect and we love both the crispy side and fluffy middle even tho it\'s made of buckwheat. Would love to have more berry compote or fresh cream to go along with this                                                       Seafood linguine: $26 which is on the ex side but the scallops were v nicely done. Mocha here\'s awesome too!  ‚òïÔ∏è with some many food places to go in SG, we hardly go to the same place twice but this - we will be back!!
Roasted Cod loin on soba tossed with mushrooms, lightly pickled vegetables, broad beans, lime and sesame dressing from populous cafe @thepopuluscafe\n<br />Decent portion of cod, the cold soba was refreshing  and tangy. A perfectly light dinner to end off a long day at work. 
I found it too sour for myself, but the plating and sundae were too perfect to be true!
A garden of edible flowers, meringue kisses, fresh lemon jelly, white chocolate crumbs, citron mascarpone and cornflake crumble on a Tahitian vanilla tower drizzled with white chocolate sauce! Having a gorgeous bowl of sundae to end the meal, it was indeed filled with surprises in very mouthful as you get a little taste of the different ingredients. An array of textures and flavours, the elements were a hit and miss for me as it can get a little sour but the luscious Tahitian vanilla ice cream can balance them out nicely. Refreshing, light and tangy, it is the perfect treat to beat the heat.

Looking for a fresh &amp; zesty waffle? Go for the lemon &amp; white chocolate sundae and opt for the additional buttermilk waffle! The Tahitian vanilla ice cream was light and refreshing, the lemon jelly added a nice tang, the cornflake crumble added nice texture and the waffle wasn\'t too heavy or soggy. Happy belly! $14 for the sundae and an additional $5 for the waffle. 
Paid 18 bucks for this  meal and well.. Freaking worth it! I would say the croissant is da bomb, the eggs are too dry and the bacon is well cooked. I would suggest: let the egg truly scramble, make it slightly half cooked so it melts with the crunchy croissant! 
From Instagram to countless food guides and blogs, The Populus has relentlessly positioned itself in the best of the best. Since reviews nowadays are extremely subjective, I visited this charming glowing cafe armed with hunger pangs and low expectations - a winning combination because this cafe absolutely nailed it with its perfection. From the chic interiors to heart warming service to divinely artistic presentation to value for money incredible taste and exquisite textures, this place is a truly worth it popular pick! Definitely coming back for more to conquer their menu ‚ù§\n<br />p.s. No service charge! What a dream üòÄ
Gorgeous photogenic and absolutely delicious. The sundae was so light and refreshing, paired with the floral and light edible flowers and crumble made it interesting both in terms of texture and flavour. There\'s also rose flavoured meringues and a really zesty lemon jelly that amped up the flavour dimension of this sundae. The rather dry and dense cake was the only turn-off for me, which was at the bottom of the sundae, topped off with lemon curd. Everything else about this sundae was just perfect!
hahaha I was telling my friend that since it\'s made of buckwheat it means we\'re eating healthy am I right?? /insert wink emojis/ this is one of the smaller pancakes in comparison to the rest I\'ve tried - and the pancake itself isn\'t sweet, you add the maple syrup and it makes it sweet! So you know how much maple syrup I drenched on my pancake afterwards ‚ò∫Ô∏è This one had the texture of a muffin! (kinda like a blueberry muffin) since it wasn\'t crispy outside just fluffy all the way through! 
The populus scramble($18.00++) make up with fluffy croissant filled with cheese ,scramble egg and a lot of bacon ,the portion is quite big just that I think the taste are in general .And please order their banana rum French toast($19.00++) ,worth trying dish :)pls make reservation if u come on weekend ,enjoy your brunch :)
Its crispy outside, pudding-like texture inside. Populus scramble ($18) is good but nth to be amazed by.  Cold morks chocolate($7.50), i personally feel not worth the money for that small bottle.

A multi-coloured party of flavours, just what\'s needed to perk up any blah day. Tender thyme seared wagyu and pesto were a perfect match completed with sweet flavour bursts from roasted pumpkin, chargrilled furikake corn, cherry tomatoes, and zucchini. The carbs -- a blend of quinoa, bulgur wheat &amp; pearl barley -- had a lovely bite to it and doesn\'t leave you feeling like a lump after.
Ate us some meat in the form of the Beef Ragu pappardelle and burger while a throng of ppl danced and beer-ed outside. It would seem that my only highlight is the housemade artisanal lychee oolong iced tea and brunch a better option for food next time. 
Soft &amp; fluffy buckwheat pancake, berry fruit compote, passionfruit curd, cornflake crumb, thyme infused maple syrup, edible flowers [S$18.50] at The Populus Coffee, Neil Road.
This was actually our favorite dish here!! It was one of those \"this is so bad for me but it tastes too good for me to care\" kinda dishes. The chicken was so crispy and well fried, and yet juicy on the inside, and the sauce (\'house special ranch dressing\') complemented the dish really well. Dreaming of that calorie bomb right now~~~
This was pretty nice, the scallops were quite sweet and the sauce was well balanced. The pasta was cooked perfectly to al dente too :) 
This was pretty good - fluffy croissant filled with cheese, scrambled eggs and bacon. However, while well seasoned, the scramble eggs weren\'t fluffy enough. In general, it wasn\'t particularly special considering the price, I ordered it because I saw that many others ordered it too but I probably wouldn\'t get it again! 
This was so yummy, I ate more rice then I should\'ve.
More like a pretty light Sticky Date Pudding, this comes with a De Luche sauce (which seems to be or very close to condensed milk), vanilla ice-cream and cornflake crumbs. It\'s not overly sweet, but I do wish that the Sticky Date Pudding itself came more fibrous rather than the banana cake-like texture it carries, though the other components are done pretty well. Overall it\'s still not too bad, but it\'s hard not to think what I am missing out for their neighbor around the corner (The Lokal) serves one of the best versions of this dish in town; would still be back at Populus to have the other new dishes they have to offer such as the \"Truffle Wagyu Beef Donburi\" which sounds absolutely delish.
A good respite from the unforgiving weather these days, but the White Cold Brew doesn\'t seem to be the forte here. It\'s rather mild on coffee, and more towards the milky side of things without being too sweet and a little watered down. Personally still feel that Grain Traders still carries the most well-balanced White Cold Brews around.
The bacon and croissant are but mere support for the showstopper that is the titular scramble - a creamy, rich, buttery cascade of eggy, smothering goodness that requires at least two to three warriors armed with Ultima Weapons and Zircon Armour to conquer. 4/5
It was so unbelievably GAO, we all squealed in delight when we found out! üòçüòç this is the cure for that humidity that lingers after the rain! ICE CREAM MORE ICE CREAM!
(All those food buzzwords in one dish!!!) but suffice to say, this huge bowl is very satisfying. The beautiful sous vide egg bursts with runny yolk with the slightest touch and the onion soy sauce brings the wagyu to a whole new level! #ilovefood thanks Erica for helping cut the egg and hosting!! ^^
Last day for the hunt on oozy foods and I\'m at @thepopuluscafe to try their truffle wagyu #donburi. (All those food buzzwords in one dish!!!) but suffice to say, this huge bowl is very satisfying.

My Apple, coffee, desserts.\n<br />Little escapes from the work desk.\n<br />#WorkHardAnywhere #PopulusCafe *
Had The Populus scramble($18) which I felt was overrated as the egg was rather simple and the croissants wasn\'t those that were freshly baked hence it wasn\'t very crispy :(  However, The Spring Onion pancake with fried chicken($22.50) on the other hand didn\'t depressed us as it\'s a unique dish and was tasty too . One point which get me really annoyed was the space constraint !!!! Each table were closely place apart and we really have difficulty moving and leaving the place „Ö†„Ö† kind advice to please arrange the layout of the cafe again before all the customer being chased out eventually . 
Nice egg and croissant combination; would be wonderful to share this instead of individual order. Can be too filling if you try to eat this yourself. They serve awesome coffee! ‚òïÔ∏è 
the brioche was soaked and dense with a pudding like texture and a tiny hint of fluff mmm I\'ve never had a brioche so moist before and I really really loved this one!! the fruits were fresh and sweet with the rum-soaked bananas spicing up the good ol breakfast dish
what better way to start the day than a good cuppa and the creamiest scrambled eggs amirite??? The populus scramble is as good as the reviews say haha good amount of spice gave it flavour and it was the perfect amount of creaminess woop :-) populus also has one of the best blends I\'ve had so shoutout to all the coffee lovers aye gotta give populus a try! 
A short walk from Outram Park MRT station, this Neil Road cafe has been pulling in the crowds with tasty mains and good coffee ‚Äî it was still buzzy even when we visited on a late Monday afternoon. Prices are on the slightly high side, but the food is good and the portion sizes are decent. The popular Populus Scramble ($17.50) sees creamy scrambled eggs and feta chunks stuffed into a buttery croissant, spiced with sliced red chillies. Its compact size belies how filling the combination is. For a more balanced, nutritious meal, try the Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($18), which comes with tender meat, a mix of quinoa bulgur wheat and pearl barley, and lots of fresh vegetables. According to our server, the beef in the limited edition Rendang Donburi ($20) is painstakingly cooked by the boss\' mother. It was sold out when we visited at 3pm, so go early to avoid disappointment. While away a lazy day with one of their excellent coffees. If you like your coffee milky but strong, go for the Magic ($5.50), which the barista described as \"a more coffee forward milk-based beverage\". 
Anyway, here\'s some scrambled egg with bacon on croissant. Didn\'t go anywhere - spent it with friends. :)
Really tender beef, but it kind of reminded us of Chinese braised flavours. Oh but the buttery mash potatoüòç. Standard warm cafe vibes, though its popularity also means it\'s crowded on weekends/PH. Prices for food are on the higher side for a cafe, and our coffees definitely could be better (skip the iced mocha). 
#Throwback to what we had over the Good Friday weekend last month. Here comes the Labour Day weekend and I know where to enjoy good food and chillax - The Populus! üòã They will be open and serving brunch menu until Monday (2 May). 
Price a lil\' steep for a grain bowl but presentation definitely scores.
I usually favour savoury food for brunch but this was da bomb. Soft fluffy French toast with crispy edges, caramelised bananas, and tangy Greek yogurt to cut through the decadence. Best thing was the crispy cereal bits that added crunch and just that bit of salt that really allowed all the flavours to pop. Could have done without the flowers though, since they didn\'t add anything to what was an already very pretty dish. 
Pappardelle was spot on al dente with a lovely bite. Very tasty, but that oomph factor was missing... 
Excellent dish - al dente linguine, a very savory seafood bisque and generous amounts of seafood. Also liked that it was not a creamy sauce, yum. 
Linguine braised in homemade seafood bisque, crab meat, scallops + butter poached Boston Lobster tail (cost $24 + $10 for lobster tail).
If you\'re craving for simple scrambled eggs and bacon, this may just do the trick for a hefty $17 of course. All embedded in a plus-size croissant. I prefer my scrambled eggs softer though.
For $18, expect an explosion of taste, all artfully blended in its mix of healthy quinoa, bulgar wheat and pearl barley (say what?!) with tender pulled pork, and a dose of veg and mushrooms to complete your meal! Not for the carnivorous!
Wagyu beef grain bowl!!!! This was so so good. Tender beef with plentiful of grains in the bowl, including quinoa and barley. Everything in this bowl is really healthy but there\'s no compromise in the department of taste at all. The bowl was absolutely cleaned to the bottom with nothing left because it was /that/ good.
Whilst the saltily-skinned cod may have gone a tad overboard in its vain efforts to achieve a Kim Kardashian-esque bronze, the soba noodles were intriguingly dressed, the sweetness and tingling tartness evoking an instant memory of Chinese New Year yusheng saucery. 3.5/5
Soft and fluffy eggs on a crispy flaky croissant sounds perfect üç≥ I would go without the bacon actually hehehe
On the positives, one of those upcoming hipster style cafes, great setting, good coffee and very reasonably priced (~25 p/person). Negatives -  having to order and pay at the counter. This is just very unsophisticated (come on guys, at least take orders at table!). Food was good but could be better; the signature scrambled eggs is so instagramable but wasn\'t as creamy or flavourful as it looks!! You only get the table for 90 mins due to long queue so can feel rushed if catching up with a group of friends. Overall experience was mixed.
The Populus scramble was SO MUCH delicious food!! The French toast was delicious but the yogurt added to it was really the winner! I enjoyed the tart flavor. Also, delicious coffee! 
We ordered a pancake and got a spectacle of colours! It was so pretty that I almost doubted its ability to be eaten üòù Luckily for us, it tasted as great as it looked. While a bit pricey at $18, it was certainly quite filling for 2 girls so it was $18 well spent üòä
Simply done, done simply the best way. Reminds me of how Australians grilled their broccoli and then topped with mozarella and baked!
The beef brisket is really beefy and melt in your mouth. Not as good as my in-law\'s cooking but you can\'t ask for more of this dish at a cafe establishment. The Japanese rice could be better though.
The dark chocolate ice cream did not taste as intense as it looked. Just having the ice cream itself might taste plain and boring. Thankfully there were passionfruit curd, raspberry puree, honeycomb, chocolate crumbs and hazelnut crumbs to add some fruitiness, sweetness, light buttery and savory tastes to it. Great way to end our meal! üòâ
This unexpectedly turned out to be our favourite at The Populus. üòç We first feasted with our eyes. Just look at that humongous roasted cod loin! It was lightly seasoned but still naturally sweet and savory. Coupled with marinated mushrooms, lightly pickled vegetables and broad beans, they added flavours and textures to the dish. The soba noodles were tossed in lime &amp; sesame dressing, the citrus and refreshing taste made us crave for more. We agreed that we would be back for this. üòã
No wonder the linguine itself was tasty, turns out they were braised in the homemade seafood bisque. Not mind-blowing awesome but overall it was not bad. 
Knowing that it is made from homemade heirloom recipe was tempting enough to pique my interest. The two big chunks of beef rendang were so tenderlicious, the meat separated very easily. We enjoyed the donburi with its generous amounts of archar, daikon and pickles, but we found the portion of the japanese rice too small. As it was peranankan-japanese fusion, the traditional spice-ful punch was absent but still tasty IMO and worth a try. üòä
Brewed and bottled in Northumberland, these slightly sparkling fermented botanical drinks are good alternatives in this hot hot weather at The Populus. Both were refreshingly sweet but I preferred the Rose Lemonade. Made with pure rose oil extract, it has a more prominent aroma and taste. üòô
{Key Lime Tart} from @thepopuluscafe was amazingly good, sweet, tardy and crusty, never thought I will like it... then again, I can just manage half a tart, can I just buy 1/2 a tart? üòÇ #dontkillme
This is definitely one of the best scrambled eggs you will desire for! Flaky crispy croissant with smooth,milky, fluffy melts in your mouth perfectly textured golden scrambled eggs. What are you waiting for? üòã
.\n<br />I will gladly choose scramble eggs as my preferred egg style.\n<br />.\n<br />Especially when it taste super creamy on crispy buttery crossiant toast.
It\'s amazing how such a simple dish made out of a croissant, scrambled eggs and bacon can taste so good! Love the cheesy ricotta scrambled eggs and buttery croissant. Only complaint was the middle part of the eggs were fully cooked, which I would have liked it better if its a little softer and more wobbly in texture. Otherwise, a very enjoyable brunch at Populus. 
Haven\'t added items to this category for a while. This signature item here, arguably, is not so impressive. Yes the scrambled egg is huge (concealing the entire croissant) and looks impressive! However, I\'m sure some would agree you\'d had better scrambled eggs (probably at an establishment beginning with the capital M). These are \"solid\" looking and really hardened somehow which is not exactly the texture you\'d be looking for in scrambled eggs. Try their other much better items like pulled pork pappardelle and pork belly ciabatta.
4 munchies: Roasted locally by 2¬∞ North Coffee Co., the special, medium body Caldera blend was slightly nutty with hints of red fruit and chocolate. Loved how my flat white was bright yet balanced with a boldness that was uplifting!
Quite a small portion but a lovely mix of vegetables and grains. The pulled pork tasty but not the mushy kind of pulled pork you would expect.
Scrambled eggs and bacon on my buttery croissant - that\'s what I call a breakfast. üòç oh, and grab me that cup of iced mocha too @yiyangk! Hehe!
Yummilicious and pretty buckwheat pancake. Pair with with their \"magic\" coffee for a perfect afternoon.
Lovely spot with interesting dishes! Like this pulled pork grain bowl for the hungry. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio!
This Lemon and White Chocolate Sundae ($14) from @thepopuluscafe was just what we needed!
That\'s from the menu. \n<br />I love pork collar, kudos to the charcoal grilled pork collar along the streets on BKK so when I see it on a menu, I am inclined to try it. And this dish did not disappoint! Juicy and fatty, every mouthful of firm, moist flesh broke apart nicely. The combination of meat juices and freshness and sweetness from the salsa verde and slaw worked well together. A definite must try when at Populus. \n<br />My OCD self wished that the vegetables and sauce did not mess up the plating before it got to the table. Oh and did I mention the beautiful light in the place. \n<br />#thepopuluscafe #burpple
Have The Populus Breakfast! Scramble eggs on croissant and topped with bacon! I love the way the bacon is done! Personally, I don\'t like it crispy. Hehe!
They do this pancake spot on! Smooth. Right consistency and texture, most importantly not burnt! The ingredients on it compliments one another.
|\n<br />The light nutty taste and fluffy texture had already won my heart. The chef smartly used the cereal to create the texture. Sweetness from the berries and just abit of syrupy were enough. Remember to spread the butter while the pancake is hot. .\n<br />|\n<br />No wonder it had become so popular in such short time.
Ordered this because we\'d been tempted by what we spied being served to neighbouring tables, but ours turned out underwhelming.
Creamy scramble egg with feta cheese, bacon and toasted croissant -- sooo good :)
I quite enjoyed this. Every element was flavorful. A nice healthy choice
Back here again for brunch and as usual... Great service, delicious food and awesome ambience. Ordered the pull pork grain bowl ($18.50) and I feel that the portion is a little but the taste made up for it. Hardly visit a cafe/restaurant twice but I keep coming back to populus for more!! 
From the brains behind Department Of Caffeine comes Populus! If you enjoy immaculate service and good quality food, this is your best bet in that area. Parking available at the pinnacle at duxton.
The word that comes to mind after a taste of Populus‚Äô Strawberry Sundae is ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù. A lot seems to be going on in this single bowl - pomegranate, strawberry sauce, melt-in-your-mouth meringue kisses, pistachio crumb, mascarpone, sumac, thyme and creamy Tahitian vanilla ice cream sitting on top a few sponge cake cubes. However, the delicate treat was surprising light with the play of textures and various flavours. Most importantly, who can resist those dainty flowers adorning the dessert?
Thankful for colleagues-turned-friends who make the daily grind enjoyable and working Saturdays less painful üòä ft. Pancakes that are almost too pretty to eat! #burpple #foodspotting #foodstamping #foodporn #cafehoppingsg
Baked buckwheat pancake with that salty sweet cornflakes crumble, fresh berries and compote. It\'s a thick pancake but I felt it could do with more moisture. How about a scoop of Chantilly or ice cream? Now that would be perfect. Pressing on this tues but at least there\'s you to look forward to. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Spring Pancake &amp; Fried Chicken ($21)\n<br />Spring onion &amp; corn pancake, crispy succulent fried chicken fillets, hint of cumin, house special ranch dressing\n<br />Available at @ThePopulusCafe \n<br />Felt quite oily especially the chicken which left a pool of oil on top of the pancake. The chicken was not crispy enough. The  dressing had a lemony and spicy taste.\n<br />|\n<br />The Populus Cafe\n<br />Address : 146 Neil Road, Singapore 088875\n<br />Tel : 6635 8420\n<br />Open : \n<br />Mon, Wed : 9am-7pm\n<br />Thu, Fri : 9am-10.30pm\n<br />Sat : 9.30am-10.30pm\n<br />Sun : 9.30am-7pm\n<br />Note : Free Wifi
For the first work week of 2016, I needed a yummy pick-me-up so I got myself a pretty pancake to chase the sadness away. Certainly a good pancake to start your day with, Populus‚Äô Buckwheat Pancake was moist and super fluffy. A unique rendition to ricotta hotcakes, it was topped with berry fruit compote, passion fruit curd, crunchy cornflake crumb, a knob of butter and have it all together with a drizzle of their thyme-infused maple syrup. Completed with floral embellishments, the pancake‚Äôs slightly crisp edge as well as the nutty and distinct taste of buckwheat also added points to the dish. Instagrammable and arguably one of the best pancakes I have tried.
Ricotta pancake seem to be gaining trend in SG, as more and more cafes are offer this. Populus\'s Buckwheat Pancake which is served pipping hot in a pan. Fluffy pancake decorated with berry fruit compote, passionfruit curd and cornflake crumb, it is both insta-worthy and delightful. Drizzle some thyme infused maple syrup over for a sweeter experience.
Bacon was impressive without being overly crispy. The croissant turned soggy probably because we took quite a while to get a decent shot of this. Rather too salty for me but egg for brunch is irresistible.
#ThankYouJesus
We only had tummy space for 1 item so it had to be their signature Buckwheat Pancake. So pretty, dainty and yum. Loved the crisp edges while the rest of it remained fluffy. Wanna be back to try other stuff!
Much hype has surrounded this new cafe player and it sure has lived up to mounting expectations. For those who\'ve had enough of pricey, run-of-the-mill brunch fare, Populus might just be the solution to your weary palate. 
The first main featured on the menu and a preamble of the good things to come. Creamy scrambled eggs studded with marinated feta for a deliciously sharp contrast, paired with fresh herbs, streaky bacon, and a buttery toasted croissant to seal the deal.
Quite fluffy despite its girth, better than the last Ricotta pancake I had. The crumbs, berries sourness and overall mix of sweetness makes it less tiring and I find myself not as jelat despite all the dough.
arguably one of the airiest pancakes I\'ve had in singapore, fluffed at least an inch high, juxtaposed with the crisp texture of cornflake crumb and the buttery blend of berry compote with a drizzle of maple syrup. vivid colours complete the mouthwatering presentation, making this well worth its $20. paired with friendly staff and a relaxed ambience, this is one cafe that I would readily return to.
This soft and fluffy pancake is topped with berry fruit compote, passion fruit curd and cornflake crumb which added an extra crunch. This unique rendition is unlike your usual ricotta Hotcake. So happy üì¶ing day!
Strawberry Sundae ($14) with full of surprises &amp; a party experience within your tastebuds.. Love the combination of pomegranate seeds, strawberry jam, the meringue kisses &amp; bite size cake!! Awesome! 
Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($18) Super rich in flavors, it\'s awesome! It includes..quinoa, bulgar wheat &amp; pearl barley,furikake baby corn, red cabbage &amp; apple slaw, chargrilled zucchini, roasted butternut squash, saut√©ed cherry tomatoes &amp; mushrooms!
A dish that either you\'ll love it or hate it. Crispy succulent fried chicken fillets drizzled with house special ranch dressing on pancake made of spring onion and corn. The pancake is kinda like Korean pancakes not the usual western, which some might find it too queer but I do like this unique combination.
New kid on the block is giving its neighbours Lokal and The Daily Roundup a run for their money. Easily the two most popular dishes are the scrambled eggs and the pulled pork with grains (even though I\'m not a fan of quinoa) - both which were fab. The fact that they\'re not your usual brunch suspects also scores some points. Either way it looks like the cafe is off to a good start and definitely worth a visit. 
Did not like the choice of pasta here but the beef ragu was delicious! üòç

This is one ice cream that will party in your mouth. It\'s actually much prettier IRL too. #weekendbrunchwiththegirls #thepopuluscafe
Not many places nails the soft creamy scrambled eggs (the way that it should be), but here, they don\'t disappoint. Topped with fresh herbs, feta, few pieces of streaky bacon and that toasted croissant, one of best I\'ve had here. This makes it to my list of \"cafes worth going back again\". #weekendbrunchwiththegirls #thepopuluscafe
Coffee never fails. Coffee made by the coffee prince, lagi best. Haha!
This is my first time trying buckwheat pancake and it does taste distinctively unique. Pancakes were fluffy and not too thick. I wish there were more fruits and less crunches on my pancake. Edible flowers are interesting although they don\'t add much to the taste. Instagram-worthy indeed but definitely can be improved. 
I ordered the The Populus Scramble and this is one of the best I\'ve eaten. The service was very good and the staffs were very alert. The ambience was very conducive to chit chat with friends even though it\'s full house. My friend ordered the beef pasta and it was equally good. Highly recommend! 
Be warned, you could be quite full after finishing 1/3 of the pancake so I suggest you order this only when you are with friends. Certainly a good pancake to start your day with. \n<br />Any suggestions for great pancakes in Singapore? I love pancakes. \n<br />#thepopuluscafe #burpple
@thepopuluscafe serves up 3 types of Espresso blends to cater to the different types of drinkers around the area! I tried the Calvera blend, a mix of dark cherries, nuts &amp; a chocolatey end. Great for a perk me up! \n<br />#aroundwithamd #thepopuluscafe #2degreesnorthcoffee #burpple
But this time, it\'s not just all looks. Populus\' rendition has got to be the best I\'ve had thus far. It doesn\'t look as fantastic as Paddy Hills\' nor Curious Palette/Strangers Reunion\'s; but in my humblest opinion the best tasting. Their buckwheat pancakes come topped with passionfruit curd, just the right amount of berry fruit compote, deliciously crunchy cornflake crumb and a small knob of butter. The pancake was moist, insanely fluffy, and so so sooooo delish. I love the idea of using buckwheat that adds a wonderfully earthy touch to the dish! Such a stroke of genius. At S$18, it\'s affordable, decently priced, and perfectly portioned for one = yummy and no waste.
First time trying the Scrambled Eggs Croissant and I was rather pleased with it.
üòã \n<br />Stuffing my face with Buckwheat Pancake (S$18) drizzled with maple syrup with berry compote, strawberries, blueberries, cornflakes crumbs &amp; flowers! Remember to share this with your friends cause unless you have a HUGE appetite, it\'s quite tough to finish it by yourself. \n<br />Have a great Monday! üòÅ
Had their pretty looking Populus Scramble that consists of their soft lusciously creamy scrambled eggs with marinated feta rest atop a buttery well toasted croissant and everything taste better with streaky bacon strips on it. The edges of the croissant remained crisp but the middle part was a bit soggy, most probably due to the wet scramble egg and we took awhile to take photos. Nonetheless it still tasted good! Pair it with their coffee brewed by @yiyangk and you are ready to start your day.
Morning coffee run. Cafe latte here is robust and smooth but no surprise since beans are from 2Degrees North Coffee Co. Featuring HKG Disneyland 10th year anni Tsum Tsum!
The interior design, the expensive coffee equipment, the attention to details, the good looking serving staff all in neatly-ironed slightly tight white long sleeved shirts‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúEven the napkins are the expensive kind.‚Äù Still in soft launch phase, the food is slightly uneven in terms of presentation and taste, but we are sure they will iron it out soon.
I wouldn\'t recommend anyone to try this, especially if no one is sharing with you. Probably only good in very small doses, but anyhow didn\'t enjoy the components on the pancake, much less the pancake itself. It\'s just very normal for $20 pancakes 
Pasta was ok, quite normal. Portion is big, good for sharing. 
Kinda disappointed with the coffee.. And that I was charged $2 for taking away my food because I couldn\'t finish lol?! Anyway food is decent! The croissant was too hard and tough though.  #Populus
Morning Indulgence to me is brunch done right! 
Don\'t you guys think this combination looks like GUDETAMA WITH HIS BACON?! Or is it just me and my obsession?
Soft creamy scrambled eggs, marinated feta, bacon stripes on toasted croissant, portion is huge that we couldn\'t finish. While scrambled eggs were good, we were a little disappointed with the hard croissant.
(P.S. Got any non slip earphones to recommend?)\n<br />.\n<br />We are finally at the EVER POPULAR @thepopuluscafe! Here\'s their Populus Scramble ($17) and their uber delish Beef Ragu ($18.50). Of course their coffee brewed by Mr Coffee Prince, @yiyangk was superb as well. MY ICED MOCHA WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD.\n<br />.\n<br />üöáOutram Park. 146 Neil Road. Singapore 088875.
Probably one of my new favourite brunch spots! :) Pretty creative items on the menu like this spring onion pancake topped with fried chicken. Classics like the scrambled eggs were well executed.
charred ginger beer marinated pork collar, roasted butternut squash with spicy yoghurt, honey coriander salsa verde, apple slaw
Visited this new cafe with @janicehelloo and tried the grain bowls. ($18) Personally preferred the chicken version with couscous, which had a very subtle hint of Indian-spiced flavours. Every component of the dish was well-flavoured and complimented each other! Really worth the price imo!
Insane craving for scrambled eggs satisfied with the epitome of brunch food : The Populus Scramble ($17). These were so creamy! With marinated feta, buttery flakey croissant that worked really well together, and crispy bacon. 
with food so yellow, I see bananas
 ($19) - tender, beefy, flavourful. Absolutely delish!!!!
Iced Valrhona Chocolate was rich and good! Drink it before it gets diluted :) Beef Pappardelle was pretty good though I would like the pasta to be al dente. Love the pulled pork grain bowl with all my favourite ingredients esp the creamy pumpkin üòä
$6. Thought it was a pretty good cuppa. Also thoroughly enjoyed our iced latte ($5.50+$1 for iced), with two ristretto shots instead of espresso. 
The slow cooked pulled beef was tender and the ragu was ooh-la-la, each mouthful drawing you into the next. \n<br />Thanks @ianortega for the treat and @yiyangk for your hospitality.  Didn\'t get the favorite spot for the IGers though ;p
Quite blessed to have so many good coffee options in SG.  Enjoyed the coffee yesterday at  The Populus Coffee &amp; Food Co.
Essentially rugged, army Encik-esque meat coated in sour veggie camo. In manner of sin-cos-tan matters, quadratic equations and the like, the dish truly perplexes. 3.3/5
Congrats @yiyangk on the opening of your cafe.  And get well really soon !
Charred Ginger Beer Marinated Pork Collar, Roasted Butternut Squash with Spicy Yogurt, Honey Coriander Salsa Verde, Apple Slaw. Dissecting this dish into the many elements, each element feels like a well-executed part on its own; the tender and juicy pork collar, the sweet and zingy honey coriander salsa verde, the sweet and earthy flavours with a bit of smokiness for the roasted butternut squash and the refreshing Apple Slaw. Combine them up altogether and it feels seemingly more abstract; a really daring and adventurous mix of flavours not meant for all palates that\'s pretty intriguing but seemed to have its own story to tell for its complexity does take a while to understand. First timers should opt for the more straightforward items (especially the signatures); they are definitely bound to leave you more satisfied though this dish was a hugely different experience altogether. On a side note, the presentation could perhaps be improved especially when it comes to more liquid components at the bottom of the plate.
Bringing a taste of Japan into cafe fare, this seems to be their rendition of Chicken Katsu Don, which features Japanese Rice, Fried Chicken Cutlet, Ginger and Spring Onion Slices, Furikake, Nanban Vegetables, Pink Ginger, Sweet Lightly Pickled Cucumber and Onsen Egg. Rice was fluffy; sticky but not clumpy while the fried chicken was really crispy and succulent, seemed to have a little tempura batter mixed in for a lighter crunch while the bottom came with Japanese mayo and a light tasting savoury sauce that seemed a tad reminiscent to Teriyaki, as well as being lightly flavoured by the Furikake. Pickled vegetables were delicious; crunchy and full of flavour. Topped off with a wobbly Onsen egg that flows that sunshine goodness with a cut from the knife. Delicious, but we would prefer more sauce for more flavour on the rice, and they could really be more generous on the Furikake; there can never be enough of that ingredient.
Hence, I ordered a cup of mocha and a slice of earl grey fudge cake, look at the beautiful latte art, it just made my mocha taste even better. I\'m definitely going back to try their savory food!

It is hard to find a reason not to like this dish unless you are resistant towards Asian herbs. üòãüòãüòãüçùüçùüçùüòªüòªüòª
My favourite ragu pasta\'s been the oxtail one offered at Osteria Mozza for the longest time - till I tried this at Populus. The perfectly cooked pasta\'s evenly tossed in a huuuuge portion of delectable beef ragu. The ragu\'s tender, really meaty, and bursting with flavours. Absolutely delish. The pasta\'s not homemade, but for the price and flavours it\'s got to be one of the better ones around. A great alternative if I don\'t wanna spend a bomb on good pasta.
Though a tad ex at S$17++. The popular Populus Scramble\'s made fancy with \"fresh herb m√©lange, marinated feta, and streaky bacon\". Neither the herbs nor the cheese were detectable; but I did like the crisp chip-like strips of bacon. Points to the well-toasted croissant which boasted a lovely crunch while retaining a moist and buttery interior!
Of the items we tried from Populus\' soft launch menu, this was the table\'s unanimous favourite. Slices of nicely charred ginger beer marinated pork collar, topped with a delish honey coriander salsa verde and apple slaw, served with roasted squash and spiced yogurt. It was light on the palate, yet bursting with flavours. The pork - albeit a little fatty - was moist and grilled to perfection.
Opened to much hype along Neil Road (a few doors down from The Lokal), The Populus Caf√© might just live up to its name. The interior is industrial-chic, complete with wood finishings, black walls, and cement floors accented with gold. Started by the same people behind Department of Caffeine, and Two Degrees North Coffee Co, a specialty coffee roaster and wholesaler, this caf√© aims to provide bold, inventive food. The Populus Scramble ($17) features creamy scrambled eggs, streaky bacon, and marinated feta in a crisp, buttery croissant ‚Äî a substantial, tasty dish. Don\'t leave without trying a dessert, in particular the Lemon &amp; White Chocolate Sundae ($13) that boasts a balance of tart and sweet with citron mascarpone, fresh lemon jelly, and rich vanilla soft serve served on a bed of more sweet goodies (think popping candy!). Pair it with their Cold Drip Coffee ($6) ‚Äî it is rather stellar!
The spring pancake and fried chicken was a thumbs-up recommendation from the staff. Fried chicken had a flavoursome and lightly crisp batter, and the pinkish meat succulent - better than what I\'ve tried at certain places that specialise in fried chicken waffles. The pancake was a bit too dense for my liking, and that definitely prevented it from being more crispy than I think it can potentially be, especially if it\'s supposed to be similar to Korean jeon. I kept thinking I was eating pea mash pancake haha. Give this a shot anyway if u\'re keen for a hearty meal! They\'re open till 6pm for now but will extend their hours till 10 or 10:30pm on weekends after their official launch next week with more items on their menu - so happy to have them here!!
Newest hipster coffee shop paying attention to intricate details on their interiors. Their soft launch menu is enough to blow you away. Congratulations on upping the cafe hopping game to another level. 
Tahitian vanilla ice cream garnished with edible flowers, thyme strawberries, pistachio crumbs, rose flavored meringue kisses, mascarpone, sumac, pomegranate and whipped cream sitting on top of fluffy light sponge cubes. A delightful dessert promised to satisfy your sweet tooth üòåüòå
The Populus Scramble ($17) -- when a place names a dish after themselves you would expect it to be pretty damn good and I\'m so glad it didn\'t disappoint!!! Soft creamy scrambled eggs flavorfully done with different kinds of herbs, marinated feta on top of a flaky, fluffy toasted croissant and how can you miss out streaky bacon!!!! Everything good in one plate. The perfect comfort food for anyone!! Go try it if you haven\'t!!! 
Cafe hopped to the 7 days old new cafe, the Populus, at Neil road yesterday with my fellow Gemini. Instead of the usual cafe food affair, I am elated to find interesting items on the menu as spring onion pancakes with fried chicken and beef ragu. Thoroughly enjoyed the food that I have ordered and left with a happy tummy. Besides having a happy tummy, not to forget about my skin as well. I have recently started drinking MU MIEUX collagen beauty drink which contains ceramide, apple extract and CoQ10 to retain moisture in my skin, fight free radicals and boast the collagen growth in my skin. Drink up n hello to diok diok skin üòçüòçüòç
Really love the ambience here especially at the corner seat! Thanks for the chat and i will see you real soon! \n<br />#populuscafe #exsgcafes #cafehopping #burpple
If brunchy eggs aren\'t exactly your thing and you prefer sandwiches; The Populus also serves two sandwiches in their soft launch menu. This would be their variation of the Bahn Mi; Ciabatta with Roasted Tom Yum Pork Belly, Daikon and Carrot Pickles, Fresh Coriander, Green Chili and Garlic Mayo. Tom Yum flavour was evident though not very prominent, while the pork belly had crackling skin and even though thin strips are used, it\'s pretty porky for how generous they are with it. The pickled carrot and daikon carried a good tang as well which brought the sandwich it\'s Asian influence.
With their signature soft flowy creamy scrambled eggs on buttery croissant, 3 long pieces of crispy streaky bacon and marinated feta! I\'m sold! Pair it with one of their 2 Degrees North Coffee and you\'re good to start your weekend well!
\"Dark Chocolate Ice Cream, Passionfruit Curd, Raspberry Pur√©e, Hazelnut Crumb, Honeycomb, Chocolate Crumb, Whipped Cream\". This was to a certain degree rather similar to the Lemon White Chocolate Sundae, but with different details; the Passionfruit curd provided a tangy flavour to the ice-cream, though it\'s not to everyone\'s tastebuds. Similar elements include the meringue kisses and popping candy, while there are also bits of egg cake and whipped cream to differentiate things a bit. What takes the cake for us was the super gao and rich Chocolate soft-serve; so flavourful and thick of dark chocolate it\'s like eating a cold, melted chocolate ganache that it ends up making your lips black like how kids accidentally smear chocolate on their faces, but all in the name of calories worth wasting and happiness of having something so good!
With a decor that screams Instagram-worthy and food that has much potential, this is one cafe to look out for during the actual launch itself. Currently still on soft launch phase, they have a limited menu but we were told that all of the items in the soft launch menu will be included with an addition of several more in the actual menu. If this is what\'s to come by, then I am eagerly anticipating more of their signatures.
Almost all tables were occupied when I dropped by earlier today. üëçüëç Just so that you know, the word \"populous\" means \"densely populated / full of people\".\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, my cuppa Joe was fresh and well-brewed. Definitely coming back for the coffee... And maybe for the food after their official launch (because the menu now is for their soft launch only). üòã
Essentially a rotund love child of Hokkaido milk and McDonalds\' soft serve. The citrus elements lend a wince-inducingly zesty zing to the proceedings, whilst the kitchen sinkful of accessories - poprocks! crumble! cake! - are largely stylish...save for the white chocolate elements, which should be left behind together with the days of yore\'s regrettable below-hip pants-wearing and the Armani hairstyle. 3.8/5
From The Populus Cafe at 146 Neil Road. Went for something light and was recommended this Lemon White Chocolate Sundae which comes with Tahitian Vanilla Soft Serve, Fresh Lemon Jelly, White Chocolate Sauce, Mint Leaves, Meringue Kisses, White Chocolate Crumb, Cornflake Crumble and Citron Mascarpone. A wonderful play of various textures, there is even popping candy to send your tongue on a thrill with every spoonful. Soft serve was creamy and rich, drizzled with tart lemon sauce which is well complimented by the zingy lemon jelly. This is a really refreshing dessert that cleanses the appetite after a heavy meal. Will be back to try the brunch items very soon!
Brewed using beans from Rwanda, the Cold Brew is pretty good here. Fruity body yet coming without any aftertaste; it\'s clean flavoured yet makes for a good perk me up during the mid day.
The Populus indeed serves good coffee üòâ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤: $6++

The barley grains were also Q and added that textural element to this dish. Next time, we will definitely return to try their pulled pork grain bowl version.

The \"heirloom\" rendang donburi is a fantastic mix of southeast Asian and Asian influences. The rendang on Japanese rice with achar invokes a complexity of taste very rarely found in fusion dishes. In limited edition and on weekends, go early or be sorry. #sgbrunch #8dayseats #hungrygowhere #sgcafe #burpple #burpplesg #rendang #japanesefusion
Probably the most popular dish in the joint, but it came up just a little short. Pity, I liked the presentation. #burpple #burpplesg #sgbrunch #8dayseats #hungrygowhere #sgcafe #scrambledeggs

With an instagrammable dish plus a nice interior decor, it\'s not wonder that there is still a queue to get a table at this cafe. In order to cope with the crowd, space was compromised and tables were stacked very near to each other, resulting in a rather cramped dining experience.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Back to the food; their signature creamy scrambled eggs has fresh herb melange and marinated feta hidden inside, served with streaky bacon and a toasted croissant. Overall, a decent but rather expensive brunch menu item.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Populus\n<br />Address: 146, Neil Road, Singapore 088875 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #thepopuluscafe #populuscafe #scrambledeggs #bacon #croissant

I evaluated for a long time and can\'t quite point my finger to what\'s wrong with my Mocha. perhaps it was the burnt taste, perhaps the milk. I still can\'t figure it out. well at least it looks good. on the other hand, the Coconut + Lemon + Lime Smoothie in the background was amazing! refreshing and thirst-quenching and didn\'t feel too \"heavy\" as a smoothie. highly recommended to try! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #thepopuluscafe #brunch #mocha #coffee #coffeeart #smoothie #latergram @thepopuluscafe

the next best alternative was this Buckwheat Pancake but I wasn\'t enticed cos it sounded too healthy. having no other alternative, I gave in to lady boss\'s suggestion and I now thank her for it. initially I was skeptical about getting pancakes that are thick and turning out good but now I literally eat my words. each corner, inside and out of this well-battered pancake was simply too delish (for lack of better word)! I actually managed to finish the entire pan cos the Berries Compote and Cornflake Crumbs with a tiny piece of melting butter gave it an extra *oomph* and made it impossible for me to waste even a single crumb. this is seriously more than just a pretty thing üòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #thepopuluscafe #brunch #pancakes @thepopuluscafe #latergram
soft, milky, fluffed up eggs, streaky bacon made crispier (thanks to the good guys over at Populus who gave in to my request) atop buttery croissant. this stuff is made of so much eggs, you would probably hit your cholesterol quota for a week just having this but it\'s so worth it! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #thepopuluscafe #brunch #croissant #eggs #bacon

Finally went to @thepopuluscafe with the foodies today. Croissant is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Eggs was indeed creamy but the top part was a little salty, probably because of the bacon sat on top of it. .\n<br />üì∑: @cassakating\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #singaporefood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instagramfood #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #instafood_sg #foodgasm #populus #thepopuluscafe #brunch #croissant #egg #breakfast #postthepeople
Tbh, I felt that their soft serve was overly creamy; barely melted despite leaving it for 10 minutes üòµNevertheless, I gotta applaud for their plating skills &amp; innovation behind this dessert! I recommend 2 to share this cos it\'s #diabetes overkill üòù may come back for their other sundae flavours! Pancakes were a slight disappointment. \n<br />AMBIENCE: 4/5 seats nearer towards the exit was nothing special. Preferred to sit inside where the decor is strikingly green &amp; minimalistic. \n<br />SERVICE: 5/5 attentive with water &amp; food served promptly despite being full house during the festive season! \n<br />#sundae #darkchocolate #populuscoffee #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #instafood_sg #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #dessert #tslmakan #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodie
üò≥ First cafe since I\'m back in SG, cos apparently, dis new cafe is the talk of the town right now! ‚Ä¢ Buckwheat pancakes with berry fruit compote, cornflake crumb, passion fruit curd &amp; thyme infused maple syrup [$20] ‚Ä¢ \n<br />Had tonnes of pancakes in Australia, but this was not outstanding üò¢ Although the pancake was superior in its fluff, it gets boring after a few bites. Perhaps it was too thick &amp; syrup given was scarce? I\'ve seen cafes countering this problem by lining additional syrup underneath the pancake, adding a scoop of ice cream &amp; splitting the batter into two thinner ones.

The pasta is cooked in a umami rich homemade seafood bisque - simply irresistible. I am a sucker for good bisque! \n<br />#thepopuluscafe #burpple

It\'s my first time here and I absolutely love the decor of the place - geometric patterns, wood, copper pipes and slate tiles. \n<br />#thepopuluscafe #burpple #bellroy #oakley

Prefer this than elsewhere\' hotcakes because this doesn\'t have the strong eggy taste. It is very light and fluffy, goes very well with a cup of coffee.
Plus some edible flowers for maximum prettiness. \n<br />Mmm.
It also comes with a side of thyme infused maple syrup, 50% of our group like it with, another 50% like it without. Luckily no pour-shot üôä

The desserts are presented in a range of cakes to sundae. I ordered the chocolate fudge cake and i was very much satisfied. Overall, i would come back again to try out their signature brunch croissant. \n<br />Price overall: $12.70
Time to build up the confident and prep for exam.
Go for this Populus Scramble which is one of their signature dish that I think it\'s huge enough for 2 person. #thepopuluscafe #burpple
We will be back to try for their mains. üòãü¶Ñ
While i liked every element on top, did not fancy the cubes of spongecake beneath. This cafe still at its infant stages. A friendly comment..always nicer to hear a \"hows the food n coffee\" instead of \"have u settled your bill\" (upon my way out).( SOP was order and pay at cashierüòÑ)#sundaes #icecream #dessert #dessertlovers #newcafe #cafesg #burpple #openricesg #i8mondays #8dayseat #sgfoodies #bloggerssg @thepopuluscafe

The Spring Onion Pancake with Fried Chicken was surprisingly good! So were the Cold Drip Coffee and Momo Black Tea #sundaybrunch #foodgasm #foodporn #foodstagram #instafood #instaeats #instagood #burpple
dark chocolate ice cream with honeycomb. #thepopuluscafe #darkchocolatesundae #honeycomb #icecream #darkchocolate #burpple
It\'s pretty good thou, just a little tad sweet, it would have gone well with my latte but finished it before this. #foodie #tart #desserts #keylime #instafood #burpple
Can\'t wait for the full menu to be out, will be back again soon! #foodie #cafesg #cafe #instafood #foodstagram #burpple #brunch
Enormous croissant stuffed with scramble eggs and American \"bak kwa\"
On the table, we have the Earl Grey Fudge Cake ($7) and a cuppa Flat White ($5.50), both delectable in their own manner. Flavour-wise, the fudge cake hit all the right spots. Indulgently chocolatey with hints of Earl Grey lingering in its aftertaste, this is perfect for a huge chocolate fan like me! I\'d have preferred the cake sponge to be more moist, but otherwise, everything else is perfect. The Flat White here is roasty, a little acidic for me. But still very very aromatic. \n<br />Still in its soft launch phase, The Populus\' current menu only carries approximately 60% of its full menu. The full launch is targeted to be mid next week, either on Deepavali or the day after. The Populus\' cafe is located near The LoKal, along Neil Road. Nearest train station being Outram Park MRT. \n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #setheats #onthetable #tablesituation #sgfoodies #sgig #sgcafe #sgcafefood #thepopuluscafe

Inconsistency folks üòú...) and shiso leaf for a bit of leafy mustard bite„ÄÇ\n<br />ÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩûÔΩû\n<br />Verdict: Hefty portions and some pretty decent flavors in a bowl for only $18; I reckon that\'s quite a steal in cafe notions... Will be back to try the Spring pancake and Fried Chicken soonÔºÅ
The toasted croissant, though, suffered from the heavy piling of wet scrambled eggs above, it\'s once golden crust reduced to a soddy mess, all except the edges which retained its crisp buttery exterior with fluffed up savoury interiors. And those streaky bacon... Words escape me. Beats me why these are exceptionally good„ÄÇ
