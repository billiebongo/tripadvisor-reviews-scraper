The menu seemed more salted egg centered like the Dirty Benny ($15.90) - your usual egg Benedict but with a spin. I kinda like it how it\'s a powder on hollandaise sauce instead of the saucy version. It lifted the jelat-ness with the sweet savoury taste.
Truffle fries $8.90...the cheese and truffle tasted soo..intense Salted Egg Croissant $6.90...Beef and R....$24.90 ..Noodle Flings..$14.90.. overall the food is good!
Flavor Flings was the first cafe to introduce salted egg croissant in Singapore and it is out to take Singapore again with its introduction of melted raclette cheese. RacletteSand is Salted Egg Croissant with melted raclette cheese, and there is also Beef Steak with Raclette. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
I ordered the Salted Egg Croissant with Raclette Cheese ($9.90) and it was the best ever. It had so much salted egg filling inside it was literally oozing out all over the plate. The Raclette cheese (yes, the cheese wheel that\'s heated and then scraped) complemented the salted egg sauce this was so good!!! The Carbonara ($14.90) I ordered pales in comparison. It was decent but nothing that wow\'d me (I order Carbonara everywhere I go hehe)
No salted egg taste at all ..  ingredients are just... very supermarket\n<br />Not too bad if you\'re not looking for impressive food\n<br />Sorry for being frank 
Hunger pangs for this Brioche Brick Toast [$11.90] with salted egg yolk lava encased with brioche toast and accompanied with a scoop of ice cream. As their salted egg yolk were one of the better ones in cafe scenes, I was expecting the oozing lava. Sadly, we have to let a few bricks were go due to insufficient sauce to go with it.
Was expecting a massive lava flow, just like any of their salted egg crossiants. But anyway, this brick has won half the battle with its rich salted egg flavour but I could definitely do more of it. üçû
The grilled honey chicken thigh is very tender, along with sweet and savoury pancake-battered onion rings, sweet curry mayo and sandwich between 2 well toasted hamburger boule. Comes with a side of salad, tomatoes and cajun fries. Definitely a different tasting burger worth trying. üòÅüëçüèª
The Salted Egg Lava Brioche Toast was amazing.
The Eggs Jupiter $15.90 was surprisingly not too jerlat but I would suggest to share üç≥
Butternut Risotto [$15.90]\n<br />Consist of calrose rice, butternut squash, shimeiji mushrooms, honey glazed croutons, permasen cheese, spring onions. Fit for vegetarian people looking for another alternative. It\'s really tasty and the flavour doesn\'t overwhelm. üòã
üçü Shoe string fries blanketed over with home made salted egg sauce, buttered cereal and spring onions. Pretty addictive.
This dish, which is essentially egg benedict with salted egg, is quite alright. However, it is very, very, sweet, more sweet than an egg benedict should be, and I didn\'t love the sausages. 
Where did all the salted egg yolk craze come from?!? If you have not tried their salted egg yolk croissant, you should probably do so because I heard many gave good reviews about it. It was even on the newspaper! Not bad Flavour Flings! Located under a HDB block, you won\'t think you\'ll find much variety there. You are wrong! They have pasta, soft yolks, desserts, hamburgers, croissants and brunch all in one menu. Seriously shiok!! Please bring all your kakis down and don\'t forget to call for reservation! No GST and service charge included. Free ice water too! Not a bad choice! 
Hamburger Boule, 15 mins grilled honey chicken thigh, dry cabbage slaw, sweet curry mayo, cajun spiced fries „Äã$16.90

What started as an innocent butter croissant pumped with a salted egg yolk mixture has now became a nationwide phenomenon that resulted in many following suit. I have since lost count on the number of places that sells their rendition of this pastry.
Feeling a little split on their rendition. Not a fan of their croissant itself, which was too doughy, breads, and lack that beautifully paradoxical buttery lightness. It wasn\'t very fragrant or tasty either. Major points to the salted egg filling that was tasty (smooth, rich, nice balance of salty and sweet) and generous; however it was so unevenly piped some mouthfuls were purely filling, and others were just plain bread.
The sauce had the same texture and viscosity of egg yolk and was salty; didn\'t really taste like \"salted egg\", but more like \"egg yolk\" that was \"salted\". The cereal topping was a nice addition though, creating a ying-yang effect of sweet and salty flavours in the dish. Enjoyed it thoroughly, but the sauce got a bit too thick and gelat at the end, reminding me of the amount of cholesterol I was consuming. 
So it is it, the salted egg croissant as a whole.\n<br />More the details of the list of salted egg croissants available in Singapore is up on mshannahchia.com üòäüòäüòä\n<br />http://mshannahchia.com/2016/02/06/salted-egg-croissants-in-singapore/
Reputed to be the home of the first salted egg croissants in Singapore, Flavour Flings is a halal-cafe that serves a good variety of all-day breakfast and other dishes with \"eggs\" as their common centrepiece. Boyfie tried the Machamps Breakfast, I had the regular Eggs Benedict and we shared their signature Salted Egg Fries. The food did not disappoint and made the dining experience really pleasant amidst the simple and cosy decor and ambience. (For my full review, check out www.mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg) 
Unbelievably creamy and delicious. It\'s like Zhi Char concept infused into the western culinary culture. Fries with salted egg yolk sauce with cereals and minced curry leaves is definitely a power punga! 
The salted egg sauce had a weird after taste, and was not as sandy as I wanted it to be, however it was strangely addictive though. I don\'t know why. For $7.50 per pop, it\'s definitely gonna be something that everyone goes for once and not be back for! üöá Kovan. 121 Hougang Ave 1, #01-1348, Singapore 530121.
.\n<br />The salted egg yolk rave strikes again, this time invading the French croissant with its orange luscious substance.\n<br />.\n<br />Croissant was done right with its light and crispy exterior plus a hint of butter fragrance to complement the salted egg yolk sauce. But the sauce was slightly thick and hence hinders a little on the flowing effect.\n<br />.\n<br />Looking at the $7.50 price tag, I will think twice before laying my hands on a second helping.
Comparing their Salted egg benedict and their Eggs Jupiter, I\'ll still choose Eggs Jupiter. Think the ham\'s taste overwhelmed the salted eggs sauce. Can\'t wait to go back and try their coffee.
Crispy and buttery croissant pairs wonderfully with the soft and delicious salmon and poach egg, a blissful texture for a delightful breakfast. \n<br />Thank you @flavourflings for hosting and @nomnom.sg for the invite!

Tomatoes, avocado, melted gruyere and poached eggs. Topped with nacho cheese, this is definitely one for the cheese lovers.
Truly awesome pancakes at just $12.90 nett. For a HDB downstairs shop, their prices are the same as those at hipster regions. At least there\'s free parking on weekends. The pancakes were fluffy and nice :) they satisfied my Pancake cravings but their chilli cheese fries were even better!
My first time trying nachos cheese on my poached eggs. I was hooked. Everything was still pretty good after we took a long time taking pictures. üòÖ\n<br />Coffee was üòñ\n<br />Didn\'t really fancy the coffee though but the good food made up for that. \n<br />Special thanks to @gorgeberzerk for the recommendation and the great service! Will be back soon!
Awesome baked eggs, fusion of the western cuisine with our Singaporean typical runny eggs. Dip with toast to savour the runny eggs.
I was pretty impressed when this came because it looked like one heck of a glorious mess. The burger featured a thick slab of juicy, honey chicken thigh that was really good! Somehow, the honey with barbecue sauce reminded me of MacDonald\'s curry sauce. The buns were toasted which is a plus point. Cajun fries went a bit too heavy on the seasoning but I think this is a pretty safe option if you want something substantial for lunch! Priced at $16.90.
The picture menu featured a series of bad pictures which made me really hesitant to order anything. However, the food here impressed me sufficiently. The croissant is quite good, buttery enough and flaky. The hollandaise was a bit too salty but brought out the flavours really well. Egg Benedict were poached well. A lot of reviews mentioned the high price, and this came at $16.90, but I did thoroughly enjoy the meal, so I would recommend this place!
Marie\'s baked egg. Something new and special which is cannot find in other cafe.  Tomato sauce + egg + Spanish + mushroom and mozzarella cheese pair with fresh bread . Yes a bit weird but taste good! Good try! 
A cafe situated at a void deck of a HDB flat at Hougang. Conveniently to everyone who love breakfast and brunch. I\'m an eggs enthusiast, would definitely come back sometimes soon. 
I always have trouble deciding whether i want to eat sweet or savoury for brunch. Clearly this is the best of both worlds. Check out the heart shaped butter. Too cute! The brioche also has caramelised onions which i love! This new cafe is worth a second look!
Flavour Flings is tucked in Hougang, and brings hearty brunch offerings to residents of the area. Recycled wood furnishings give this place a laid-back vibe, perfect for casual brunch affairs. Popular items include the Eggs Jupiter ($17) ‚Äî poached eggs on brioche, with avocado, nacho cheese-baked potatoes and chicken sausages, and Marie\'s Baked Eggs ($13.90), a comforting breakfast favourite served with crispy toast.\n<br />*Muslim-owned, Halal-certified suppliers
Was pleasantly surprise with my first slip on the ice latte.. Nice aroma and quite flavorful. 
I usually will not go for cream pasta but this was actually nicely done. 
A holiday special at flavour flings. Sorry, but non existence of truffle oil. More of cheese and normal fries instead.
Taking a closer look at these outerspace eggs. Nacho cheese sauce could be slightly more and cheesy please!
Wondered how eggs from Jupiter is? Not covered usually with hollandaise sauce but with nacho cheese! - $17 Nett
mainly an all day breakfast kind of cafe, their menu includes a lot of eggs + toast. it\'s located opposite ciel, so maybe have food here and cake there hehe
At $7 without any extra charges, they serve a kind of creme br√ªl√©e with a wider radius than those typical ones. Particularly liked it this way as they are more sugar coating to crunch on! 
At first it was quite difficult to find this hidden gem... The place is very cosy and u feel like u are in a garden... Kinda forgot that you are actually under a HDB flat with kopitiam everywhere... First look at the menu.. Simple and light meals... Specialize in all day breakfast. I kinda like to have pictures in the menu unfortunately their\'s was just description.\n<br />So we ordered Atlantic Shirred Eggs ($16), Machamp\'s Breakfast ($18) n beef chilli cheese fries ($10)\n<br />I would say worth a revisit. Good thing also is not that crowded... So I could take my time enjoying my FOOD!\n<br />It was quite filling for us thats why I regreted not trying their desserts!  Ugh! Wanted to try \'The Awesome One\'... Shall I go back and try their desserts? #brunch #breakfast #desserts #burpple
Flavour Flings is a brand new heartland cafe located in Hougang, bringing hearty brunch servings to residents and everyone else in the area. Recycled-wood furnishings give this place a very laid-back vibe, perfect for casual brunch affairs. Menu items include eggs done in a variety of ways - poached/ baked/ fried, pastas as well as pancakes. Tastemaker Raine Liu recommends Marie\'s Baked Eggs; \'tomato based eggs with mushrooms and spinach and cheese which went well with the toasted sour dough bread.\'
Coffee a little too milky, lesser of a coffee taste.
Caf√© at their 3rd opening week, cosily located in the neighbourhood of lorong ah soo. They provided very filling large brunch servings at reasonable NETT prices. What we had were their Marie\'s baked eggs, tomato based eggs with mushrooms and spinach and cheese which went well with the toasted sour dough bread. We scoop it up to the last bit. Will be back for their chef specialty of pancakes!
Their Creme br√ªl√©e comes full with crackling melted sugar on the top, which cracks with a knock with the spoon to reveal its custardy, eggy inside. Pretty decent, given how many disappointing ones I have had lately with watery sugar over the egg custard.
Baked eggs in cream sauce with spinach and smoked salmon. Cream sauce gave the eggs a nice savoury flavour, but can get a bit overwhelming with the smoked salmon. Spinach gave it a nice break in between when it gets a bit too salty. Come with toast to smother the eggs on, which has crisp edges which was a pleasure to eat.
Pancakes drenched in salted caramel, bananas and walnut bits. Loved how the salted caramel is just of the right salty-sweet ratio, and how the edges of the pancakes came with a slight crisp with its fragrant batter.
Brunch!!
Or in this case, the gravy.. which is made up of garlic, white truffle oil, parmesan cheese, mushroom and a pouch egg tasted slightly overkill as the garlic taste is overpowering. Despite that, I still \'kinda\' enjoy my plate as I\'m heavy palated!. The poach egg is another refreshing addition! Not sure if it\'s their intention but the overly rich gravy is certainly gonna make you feel jelak after a few bites..\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#pasta#speghetti#flavourflings#cafesg#poachegg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#hougang#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#expo#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
Good or bad really depends on your preference! But sadly, the food feels cold. On the other hand, with its pairing of brioche, poach egg salted egg yolk sauce(very mild), turkey ham, chicken sausages and butter cereal, it is overall quite enjoyable. The mild sweetness from the cereal is a refreshing twist to this meal as it helps to give a little balance to this savoury plate. The chicken sausage is also good, something that I didn\'t expect.. love it how this cafe which use to be known for its salted yolk croissants serves decent meals too!

The poached egg has a runny and flowy yolk with a hardening crust and there is no raw white remaining. \n<br />Compared to some of the mediocure\n<br />poached eggs that I have tried previously, this is actually pretty impressive for a heartland cafe
eggs overload.
