Catch Windowsill Pie at their Horne Rd location till this Sat! üò¢ Incidentally, one of my few places that started my #cafehopping! Sad to see it go!
Both pies were yummy! Loved the interesting addition of truffle in Camp Symmetry!
Good to find their piccolo latte is still as good as before.
Anyhoo, I finally got to try the pecan pumpkin Pi. \n<br />The pumpkin was as expected pumpkin-y. Heavy and rich. Bleah. Not for the lone Monster to have alone but still a delicious Êãç\n<br />The base of the pie was a tad too sweet though. \n<br />Monster can\'t wait for Halloween \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Time to hit the weekend! \n<br />Loving the fragrant tea in bubbly milk :) Monster can\'t get enough! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
On a mission to hunt down the good and bad key lime tarts in Singapore and this trip has brought me to Windowsill Pies for their Coconut Lime Vodka ($7). The sourness of the lime curd makes me squeaked in excitement but sadly there\'s not a single hint of the coconut. The concentrated vodka jelly cubes are hidden at the back which I feel can be left out too, unless you love alcohol in your pastries.
Continuing my hunt for more good and bad key lime/lemon tarts in Singapore, the Strawberry Lemon Tart ($7) from Windowsill Pies comes with many positive recommendations from the community and I agree with them. The vibrant-looking lemon curd is light and tangy, just nice for an after-meal treat while the little pockets of strawberry filling give a burst of surprise when you reached towards the end of the tart. Even lethargic teddy in the background needs a little perk-me-up this midweek. 
On another note monster has a new fav at windowsill! \n<br />Passion fruit with white chocolate! \n<br />It\'s a great mix of sweet, sour and chocolate richness. \n<br />Monster loves Pais! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
A pot of tea, a slice of pie, and tons of joy. I tried the newer Passion Yogurt slice, which was refreshing and an absolute delight. Would\'ve liked a creamier natural yogurt flavour instead of the pineapple yogurt used, which made it a wee tangier than I\'d like.
It differs from white coffee, which is coffee with cold milk or other whitener added.
Creamy lemon curd with strawberry jam, topped off with meringue! In a fairly hidden location, Windowsill Pies serves a number of interesting sweet pies/ tarts and my friends decided on sharing the strawberry lemon pie as a before dinner dessert. The meringue was pretty good and the pie was tangy as well as refreshing, and to make things even better it was a joy dinning in the adorable fairytale interior!
Essentially a lime tart with a curd that is sweet enough such that your mouth doesn‚Äôt violently react to the sour (the lime is there to squeeze if you crave for such pleasant oral torture), but then you discover the innocuous jelly cubes made from vodka shots (!!) hiding in the boot, and then the party goes from Yogi bears and forest picnics to sarong party girls and a totally different kind of dark forest experience. As for the coconut, its left thigh makes a guest appearance in the cream. 4/5 
All the flavours were appealing to my taste buds and they all carry a ingredient surprise through the back of the pies. Staffs were friendly, Ambience is gr8 &amp; place wasn\'t crowded at all. :Just how I would love my cafe to be:
Just a short walk from CSHH, you\'ll find this woodsy theme cafe. They serve pies and savory food as well that changes every 2 weeks. Warning: One bite of their pies n your standard of how pies should taste will be changed forever..for the better of cos!
Sunday tea with lemon pie and muscat blanc tea. Love that the pie is tart and not overly sweet. The Muscat blanc tea was very fragrant! Perfect for the heat.

Definitely a gooood cosy place to hangout with your friends. Beautiful cottage concept, which has a window looking exterior that lives up to its name, windowsill. Super cosy environment i must say. And it\'s just 5 mins away from Lavender Mrt. A place to indulge in good pies, be it the ones with or without alcohol ones. The ones i\'ve tasted is non-alcoholic ; S\'mores and Lemon Meringue. S\'mores is darn good, topped with marshmellows and biscuit! Just nice and you won\'t have those sick in the throat feeling, due to the chocolate. Highly recommended! Lemon meringue is good as well. Rich is lemony flavour, and oh the meringue on top is good as well. Accompanied the pies is, Iced Mocha And Iced Chai Latte and this Chai Latte is only for those who love spicy drinks! You\'re warned. I\'m not a fan, and i have to let it rot instead because the taste is just.... Unexplainable. In all, a good place to try out. But, not a place i would go twice. Once is good.
Found it abit pricey ($7-8 per slice) and taste was okay. Wasn\'t something that impressed us.
Back at me favourite pie place for a little snacking time before dinner. The passion fruit yogurt pie had some secret chunks of white chocolate inside that made it so delightful (even though I actually don\'t like white choc). Although I felt that this pie could be a little more tart but I guess it would suit a more normal tastebud with its balance btw sweet &amp; sour. As for the apple &amp; rum pie. I like that the crust is still crunchy even though it\'s a baked pie (where a lot of times, the pie crust can end up soggy) although the notes of rum was a little low, it was still delicious!
We are having the signature strawberry lemon ($7) and their exotic camp symmetry white chocolate, raisins and truffle ($8).
Decided to try something seasonal! But didn\'t taste as good as I imagined.. It didn\'t taste bad, but it wasn\'t great either? The crust was a little too thin for my liking as well.
Wanted to try out the new cafe, two bakers but it was closed today and ended up here instead. Tried out their new savoury menu! The chicken stew was pretty good but just a tad too salty though. It\'s quite nice to eat the toasted bread with the chunky chicken on top!
Choc pie x dark choc x marshmallows and graham crackers. Not sweet so I guess dark choc lover will like it.
Pecan Pie and Smores Pie - YUMS
Had the camp symmetry, which had a smooth white chocolate pudding base with truffle infused cookie crumbs on top. Really good. The buttery tart,  fragrant on it\'s own, with the sweetness of the chocolate... Exquisite! Also had the pecan pie which had a nutty toffee like base which I liked too! Would love to try more of their flavours! The mocha wasn\'t too nice, a bit bitter and lacked the aroma of coffee. Iced chocolate drink was alright, not too milky nor powdery. 
My favourite from the plate is the strawberry lemon pie. The lemon taste was perfect, it was sour enough and I love it. However the strawberry taste could have been stronger, if not it feels like I\'m only eating a lemon pie. Love how they have the meringue on the pie (sinful but i love it!). The base of the banana pie come with snickers bit and it\'s super appetizing to one\'s mouth. The Choco wasn\'t to my liking as it\'s dark choc (I don\'t like dark choc). Overall it\'s good and I\'ll head back to try the other flavours soon! üôä
Love the combination of pies and tea! Very awesome freshly baked pies üëç 
Some sweet pies to fill up your stomach, after some filling lunch/dinner. Loved the place as well, good to hang if you\'ve got some time to waste!
It\'s gonna be a great/memorable weekend I\'m sure(: TGIF.
Triple Wow! This is a full steak serving disguised as a burger. The steak was awesome and flavourful. 
Had the famous sambal fish nearby..and went for coffee over here. .cannot resist the pies..so I chose a lemon strawberry..pleasantly refreshing!
Chocolatey goodness topped with toasted marshmallows &amp; home-made graham crackers, $8. I\'m so in love with this! 
Sour lemon curd topped with a layer of jelly and hidden is another layer of strawberry. Love this pie since I had some lemon curd craving. 
Amazing #banana #almond brittle that I had!! Love the crunchy nuts^^ i will be back again üòòüòò
Tried the chocolate mousse with marshmallows üòã my friend got the grasshopper mint cake. Cafe got a nice ambience with pretty friendly staff. 8/10 Price Range for each cake 7-8.5 I think
Their pies are thee best even though it\'s a little pricey, it\'s worth every penny.
Most of us know that this place boasts delicious pies, but they also do serve a variety of main course that were quite a hit for us. Enough said, make the trip down yourself as I promise that it wouldn\'t disappoint. (Approx $45 for two)
Double pork patties, marinated with Tabasco. Topped with guacamole, salads and a toasted bun with a side of nachos and a lightly dressed salad.
Pork burger packed with flavours in it\'s marinate
Every parts of the cafe is a photo taking opportunity ... Really love the place there. The banana almond brittle is one of their best seller and those with less sweet tooth will like it cos is too sweet and refreshing too... I\'m a mint person so the mint pie is just nice for me and is chocolate flourless cake .. Haha less sinful!! :)
S\'mores pie in windowsill pies... Chocolate fudge pie topped with toasted marshmallows ‚ù§Ô∏è #burpple
KBB = Kong Bak Bao, I was told. The Atas level is not quite there but interesting overall. 3 flavours: Mango Chili, Pea &amp; Guacamole and Crispy Beancurd Skin.  By the way, KBB is a local soy stewed pork belly sandwiched by steamed bun. In this adaptation. The pork belly are grilled instead and bun fried.
Second chance... And wow I love this coconut lime vodka #pie. Coconut cream on top, tangy lime curd with vodka jelly cubes embedded inside.
Banana Almond Brittle | Coconut Lime Vodka | S\'mores (from bottom to top)
Much needed Smores and Peppermint pie from Windowsill In The Woods.\n<br />Loved the Smores with chewy marshmallows and base. Peppermint was good as well as it wasn\'t too minty; had a good flavour to it.
If you can\'t decide which pies to order the next time you visit @windowsillpies, just order everything.
You can never go wrong with chocolate and mint; they make a delicious combo! :D
Oooh the vodka jelly cubes embedded within were quite a surprise! :)
Seasonal favourites x to-be-released xmas pie! @jonahwongofficial #windowsillpies #foodporn
Pumpkin Pie with Bourbon and Vanilla Whip, Banana Almond Brittle Pie.
Every Afternoon should be like this, well-spent. üç∞üçµ
A quaint quiet place to chill and have a nice chat over a cup of Gryphon tea. Pies are of excellent quality and the staff there were happy to explain each of their tea and pies!
extremely tart ! a good choice for after a heavy meal as it is not as jelak. 
nice to have a cafe in the area that opens until 10.30pm on Fridays, unlike the silly CSH... how can a cafe close at 7pm?! windowsills is also much more conveniently located than Antoinette.
This place needs no introduction. The pies are generally divine, and my favourite is definitely the grasshopper pie. The pie crust has the flakiness of a puff pastry and richness and crunchyness of a butter cookie which was unlike any I have tasted. The mint and chocolate combo was smooth, sleek, velvety and cool; it was definitely a show stopper. On a related note, I want a birthday tart as my birthday cake next year! 4.75/5 #windowsillpies #grasshopperpie #dessert #secretlifeoffatbacks
I\'m not a coffee person, but made an exception and enjoyed this one (: 
best pies! #sgfood so much love for the chocolate fudge pie with truffle infused chocolate crumble!!
Nice but too expensive! I can make it my own üôà $7.50 a slice
$8 Loved this. Tasted like mousse with marshmallow to me.
$8. Kinda regret not having my lunch first before eating this cos it was on the sour side. Loved the crust.
Chilli, Mango &amp; Orange Pickles; Spring Onion &amp; Pistachio Pesto; Shiso &amp; Yuzu; Milk Jam &amp; Pork Crackling;
Pie ($8) latte ($5). Pie great with three layers: dark chocolate, chocolate pudding and marshmallows. Crackers of the right texture, not dry. Marshmallows on top were toasted with a strong smoky barrel-like smell retained. 
With an intriguing combination of white chocolate pudding, raisins, white truffle cookie streusel, and a topping of candied thyme
Very luckily the last slice. 
A pie specially designed for the upcoming event Camp Symmetry: white chocolate pudding with white truffles, truly special to my taste bud. Do you dare to try it?
With caramel, cr√®me br√ªl√©e custard and chocolate praline ganache layers
This one started out as a Christmas special but turned into a regular. With succulent saut√©ed apples baked in a fragrant almond custard and topped with enchanting rum-soaked raisins.
Cost $8. Not too sweet and can taste the blueberries. Crust is very flaky.
Love this drink. Reminds me of Christmas. And the Meringue mushroom is just too cute! 
With a magic shroom üòÅ
Haven\'t had these for a while now. Key Lime Vodka and Banana Cognac Almond Brittle Pies
Banana Cognac Almond Brittle Pie. Cognac-infused whipped cream and moussey banana parfait studded with crunchy almond brittle sit in a flaky pie crust - every mouthful is a flood of flavours and textures that pleasure the taste buds, then wash away without leaving that cloying sweetness I hate.
The last one to finish trying all nine!! #tgif #pies #foodporn
Those are not funny pies but he bought these two pies and off we go for a picnic!
Yums spotted favourite pies! They have a temporary booth here, today last day!
Lovely location and awesome pies (confession: there were two of us and these weren\'t the only pies we ended up eating)
The pies are good! My favorite is the s\'more pie with the grahams biscuit and smoked marshmallows in it. The minty grasshopper pie is equally good but not as chocolatey..nice cafe ambience and delicious pies, worth visiting again 
Sweet treats from K to end the day! Caramel pie from favourite pie cafe! Close up shot next!
Banana Caramel Pie! Ôçå It was just nayyyyyyy!!!
Back for some pies on Sunday afternoon! Ôòã
After seeing it countless times, i\'m finally here @ Windowsill! Grasshopper Pie, get in ma belly! :)
How I found out I\'m not a pie-lover: I remember with more fondness the beautiful steak, medium done, slathered in mushroom cream sauce made with cr√®me fra√Æche.
Banana Pie with Almond Chips. Delicious! And the cute wooden fork and packaging are so nice. Love it.
We found windowsill pies at pasarbella last weekend! This is lime and vodka pie..was so good that we went back and bought two others - lemon &amp; strawberry and the banana almond brittle pie. So so good.
Today is Friday. I will post all the desserts!! ~ S\'mores Pie
I prefer the banana pie. Wish the mint taste was stronger! 
Pumpkin Pie üéÉ with Bourbon Whip! üí´ Their home made filling is made without spice, so the pumpkin really sings! üé∂ Topped with a rosette of Bourbon and vanilla whipped cream which lends just the right amount of fragrance! üëÖüí¶
The Grasshopper Pie simply minty, soft and yummy! üòã Definitely my fave since I\'m a mint lover! It has a yummy chocolate flourless cake base topped with a crazy fresh mint cream. Crowning it are shards of dark chocolate and clusters of salty chocolate cookies. üòç
A mix of pear, rosemary, peanut butter and hazelnuts. Delish! 
Simply love Windowsill pies &amp; it\'s very fairytale like decor. Simple but pays so much attention to details. More photos of the cafe at DanielFoodDiary.com
super awesome and sweet pie from the most cutesy cafe ever seen in Sg
Went pie tasting with @danielfooddiary .  The creator of the pies @mikey_jahat was there
the marshmallow had the fragrance of bbq meat (!?) still a delightful dessert!

Rich and crunchy. Like the truffle flavour in it. \n<br />Pistachio &amp; Pear ($7.50/ slice)\n<br />Thinly sliced pear on baked pistachio custard. Rich and moist. Would prefer the pear to be softer.
[$8] Smooth, creamy yet not overly sweet. Though it isn\'t aesthetically the prettiest, it tasted heavenly! Kinda steep on its price though, I must say üòÖ\n<br />Overall, IMO: 3.7/5

Lovely cafe w a wide variety of pies to cater to all taste buds, made fresh daily and taste great! Will be back soon to try other flavours! 
I\'m back again for more. This time round items ordered: iced chocolate, flat white, camp symmetry pie, coconut lime vodka pie. They placed a vodka flavored jelly in the pie and it is rich-flavor. For those who like vodka, would love it. The taste is slightly sour. Cranberries are found in champ symmetry pie, it blended well with the white chocolate pudding. Those with sweet tooth would love it.

We didn\'t managed to try famous tart strawberry lemon because it was sold out. So we tried the peppermint chocolate tart, it is really minty and peppermint lovers would love it. We also tried the chocolate tart, the chocolate is very rich üëç chocolate lovers would love it. The ambience of the cafe is good for chilling and relaxing and also a date for couples.

Coconut lime vodka pie has always been my favourite. Love how the zesty taste is balanced w vodka jelly. Tried their truffle pie, wouldn\'t have figured out that truffle can be taken sweet as well! Banana pie was light with a slight note of cognac. Love the almond brittles in the tart crust!
I really really like the pies so much!

Another #cafe checked - Windowsill in the Woods. What\'s #windowsill? Basically it\'s a ledge forming the bottom part of a window. #caffeine checked #cakes checked #Singapore
Octopus pasta :) #food #luncheon
Who knew that apart from pies, windowsill had savouries as well? This came highly recommended - an atas version of the pork belly bun. Essentially it was a generous slab of well prepared pork belly placed within a deep fried mantou bun (the kind you dip into your chilli crab sauce), accompanied by crackling pork skin, dulce de leche, and the richness of the milk jam to top it off. Certainly it was all sorts of sinful, but at least it was nothing short of amazing. One bun and one pie and my appetite and calorie count is done for the day. 4.25/5 #fortnightsg #windowsillpies #kongbakpau #dessert #secretlifeoffatbacks
