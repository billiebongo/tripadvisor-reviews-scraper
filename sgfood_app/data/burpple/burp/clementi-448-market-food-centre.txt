(#01-45) There\'s constantly a queue at this stall, I finally know why. Thank goodness I only had to queue for 10mins or so. Apparently they sell out really fast, heard a few people ask if they\'re still selling before they joined the queue. It\'s pretty good for its price at $3 (it actually has the carroty taste) and quite a generous portion! But ok I probably wouldn\'t bother queuing if it takes as long as what other people said (30-45mins???) This is the first time in 4 years I\'m early enough with spare time to actually get to eat this. Good start to the end of my week yay. Update: I barely managed to finish the $3 plate. Maybe partly cos it\'s kinda greasy so I think it might be good to share HAHAHA.
The fragrant of this dish is definitely irresistible. Having to say that Char Kway Teow is one of our famous traditional dish in Singapore. As this dish has been increasingly popular over the years, many cooks have come up with many interpretations of the same basic ingredients of rice cake stripes/flat noodles stir-fried with almost anything with eggs. Various ingredients to go along like chinese sausage, prawns, cockles, chicken. As compared to all notable versions, Penang Char Kway Teow is still the most famous among others. Leading from the popularity in Singapore &amp; Malaysia and favorited by many locals till today. 
This place used to sell my grandma\'s favourite orh luak until a new owner took over.
\'Otak\' is a grilled fish cake made of ground fish meat mixed with tapioca starch and spices.
While the taste isn‚Äôt extraordinary, its old-school flavour, slurp-worthy dark black sauce base and generous ingredients can woo customers back.
YUM I love hawker food! Clementi food centre is definitely one of the old gems in Singapore and spent only $7 on dinner! *burps: time for more workouts
Generous portions of tender beef with each ribbons of hor fun bursting with smoky flavours of wok hei. They are one of the many stalls that accept NETS FlashPay which makes paying super convenient! üòã www.misstamchiak.com
Stumbled upon this \"no signboard stall\" but selling different variety of food for breakfast &amp; lunch. A total different menu for both meals. This is not too bad for a start, but surely he knows who are his competitors. But I like your originality that keeps what\'s original and not. A simple lunch after all? So what are your favorite carrot cake in Singapore? 
So here\'s one of the classic for this week! The authentic Satay Chicken Chop rice from Tanglin Halt Western Food @ Clementi 448 Food Centre! 
Oh my tian. Thank you to @misstamchiak who spent 45 min queuing for this plate, and shared her passion in doing the things she do. Blogging is a lot of hard work &amp; patience.
It feels like a Monday again, but it\'s almost weekend again. Tight schedule this weekend, but don\'t forget to indulge on what you need! \n<br />My daily routine, but something different this time! - Duck Noodles @ Clementi 448 Hawker Fares!
We all truly deserve this mid-week break aye? TGIW! Something to spice up our day! \n<br />Here\'s one at Clementi Hawker Centre with the one and only famous Ayam Penyet with endless queue. Tasting this goodies at only $5.00!\n
Song\'s XO fried fish bee hoon, with the breezy weather at the side that makes it perfect. A bowl of quality instead of quantity and one of the best choices to have at Clementi Central 448 food centre. 
Tanglin Halt\'s black pepper chicken chop. If you prefer something classic and authentic? Here\'s one to try @ Clementi 448 Market. It\'s mid-week, so it\'s good to reward yourself a plate of goodness and not forgetting to drink up. Insane weather today üò™ 
This was one of the pleasant eats I had weeks ago at clementi 448 hawker centre. This stall is not well known among others but to get your fishballs noodles craving satisfied, then it\'s a stall to visit in Clementi! 
Knowing it\'s ability to crack my soft spots for such a traditional dish and absolutely rare to see them appearing at hawker centre these days. 
The one and only chai tow kueh (Carrot Cake) in Clementi Town. Their carrot cake is a sweeter version compared to others you have tasted in Singapore. Given the portion that was $3.00 is absolutely good for one!
Given the choice of char kway teow, carrot cake &amp; oyster omelette. I enjoyed this the most. The most savory and yet flavorful oyster omelette giving a few dips to their signature chilli sauce which adds alittle more spices onto it. This is one of the humble stall with the old man and the son working on those food they deliver to their customers!
Carrot cakes should be devoured only if they are flavourful and moist, along with the chilli that has been thoughtfully cooked. This plate was alright, a bit too much soy sauce. Well i like it spicy, but different stalls have their own methods and specialities. All in all, do the younger generations know how to cook a decent plate of local delights?
The awesome char kway teow living on it\'s delicacy of the traditional national dish. This is one of their signatures where all customers return to get your stomach satisfied. With the flavors are the usuals but not easy to find such authentic taste of char kway teow else where!
What\'s good about hawker food is that they are pocket friendly and definitely delicious. They stay true to their tradition, nuff said. This plate of oyster omelette ($3) was fried to a level of crispiness that was just right. The chilli sauce has got a very nice zesty flavour to it.
The one chose to be unknown, but it\'s just another char kway teow store in town. Nothing fantastic but somewhere you can find to get a plate of char kway teow! Located just right beside Snow Mount (The famous fried banana store!)
This was from a stall that only sells this one dessert &amp; is supposed to be famous. Too expensive at $2 a container with not much ingredients and a soup that\'s lacking the logan fragrance. Perhaps I\'m too spoiled by the one at Amoy St
One of my go-to hawker dishes is fish soup &amp; this place does it really well! I think I found a new favorite. Very generous portions of fresh fish at $4.50, heaped with veggies &amp; delish soup, if I could have this again for dinner today, I would, it\'s that awesome. üòç
So what\'s Michael Jackson? Did he just revived from his grave? Kid. This is the famous tau huay drink you can find in clementi 448 market. Given it\'s name, Michael Jackson just because it\'s a mixture of soya bean and grass jelly. Get it? üòÑ it\'s one of the way to end from your hearty lunch you had!
One of the most decent tasting Hokkien Mee in Clementi. With it\'s flavorful and humble serving of $4.00 which doesn\'t burn a hole in your pocket. 
One of my pet peeve when it comes to food! Overcooked eggs urgh. I also hate it when they serve meat or mains ON TOP of fries - goes all soggy and not pleasant at all üò™ do you have a food bugbear too?
What meat grills you can think of, Tanglin Halt Western Stall will provide! Here\'s one of their dish, although it may looks ugly on the appearance but this taste as good as one will not be enough! Be surprised!
Extra ordinary steamed chicken laksa, many hawkers used it for curry noodles instead. It definitely blends in well with the laksa gravy and the intensity of the chilli. It\'s spice up your day for sure! It\'s sinful but worth a try!
Chicken Cutlet Rice w Otah and Sugarcane juice. cutlet rice from Tanglin Halt Western Food Stall, this plate never goes wrong but personally i think lesser sauce on the cutlet is good already, $4.50. otah was from another stall, $1 and sugarcane juice was from some random juice stall, $1.50. $7 for a hearty meal, why not! #lunch #westernfood #tanglinhaltwestern
I managed to finish the whole plate today. Even my mum was amazed and she asked me \"ÂìáÔºÅ‰Ω†‰ªäÂ§©Ê≤°ÂêÉÂçàÈ§êÂïäÔºüÂæàÈ•øÂïäÔºü\" LOL...
Sliced fish mui fan and beef hor fun from the relatively new stall at the hawker centre. Generous with the fish but the sauce for the beef is a bit salty.
Oyster egg was disappointing though there were oysters. There were literally no eggs at all. Rojak was alright except there were alot of burnt parts. 
Springy noodles and absolutely the best dumpling I\'ve ever eaten. 
$2.50
Loose but full of eggs and crunchy chye poh ‚òª fat worthy :b
This place serve the best fried oyster. BIG and FAT! @zigazackkkkk
At $4.50, this sliced fish hor fun takes the cake when it comes to a piping hor fun fix in the afternoon. Not to forget our favourite whampoa beancurd with ginko and white lotus at the same coffeeshop. Kinda wish we stay at Clementi so we can have these everyday üòá\n<br />_______________\n<br />Kee Hock\n<br />Clementi 448 Market and Food Centre\n<br />#01-43\n<br />448 Clementi Ave 3\n<br />Singapore 120448\n<br />.\n<br />#eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #exploreflavours #dojoeats

The shop has an unique name È∏°Â§¥ (Chicken Head) The fragrance of the rice and the ginger source and the tenderness of the meat is so tasty. It\'s always good to share good food with all followers. Mainly $4 you can get a plate of chicken meat with livers, soup and rice. I\'m sure you will not regret.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#livetoenjoylife #noneedtohideanymore #happysunday #wheretoeatsg #livetoeat #ShotOnXperia #SonyXperiaXZ1 #burpple
It carried a wok-hei flavour, while tasting savoury and slightly spicy!
Always loved to add gizzards, liver and an egg.
It comes served with cuttlefish, tau pok, cockles and kangkong.
The beancurd is silky and smooth which melts in your mouth. The red bean and ginkgo nuts are additional if you wanne add on and they are good too.. #instafood #insta_food #food #sgfood #sgfoods #foods #yummy #hungry #foodism #foodgram #foodgasm #foodfie #foodspam #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodstagram #foodspotting #sgfoodspotting #foodshare #sgfoodshare #foodpics #beancurd\n<br />#sgfoodpics #foodie #foodlover #8dayseat #burpple
Had a satay craving.. Its been awhile since i last ate here. $0.42 per stick. üò¨ i tried to be funny ordering 18 sticks but the auntie prefer it to be whole number. So 20 sticks it is. Haha. Rice is $0.60
I like the tau pok here, it\'s not those crispy and airy type. It is those puffy type that has a good texture bite to it. It is even more delicious with it soaking up the delicious laksa broth. The laksa broth was also not too rich and oily, which I finished up to the last drop.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood \n<br />#weeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #laksa

Before the stall even open there is already a long q but for me good food are worth the wait!\n<br />-------------------------------------------- The meatball (fried/steam) is their signature ingredient and there are other ingredients like tofu, bitter gourd that are wrapped in meat or fish paste which is equally good! etc.. I prefer the dry version cause their chilli is damn power and mix it with the sweet sauce üëçüëçüëç 1:1  I\'m a person who doesn\'t like the ytf chilli n sweet sauce but this is different and btw i tabao so pic wise it looks diff. 9.5/10

Not sure if they changed name or I just never noticed the close resemblance to the famous cheng mun chee kee name... Anyhooo I find their pig organ soup almost up to that standard! $4.00 for a generous amount of ingredients (salted veg, pig stomach, intestine, pork slices, pork belly, tofu) and a flavourful soup which I always SLUURP FINISH. They sell kway chap too!

And me, as the good wifey, will always accompany him to eat the same. Look at the amount of pork lard in there! No wonder it\'s so fragrant.
