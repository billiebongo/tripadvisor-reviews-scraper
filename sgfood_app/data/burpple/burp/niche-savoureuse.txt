Can\'t help noticing that cute small kiwi, does kiwi come in that size?
This niche seasonal fruit medley tart - the almond crust shell filled with the Madagascar Vanilla bean custard is surprisingly good with the mildly sweet and sour seasonal fruits on top!
Delicious strawberry cake! Generous topping of fresh strawberries. The strawberry mousse was light and wasn\'t artificially sweetened. Cake layer was quite substantial, with slices of strawberries in between. Definitely recommended! $5.90
With a name like that, how can you not want to try it! Top layer boast of green Sicilian pistachios creme brûlée, which was light and rather fragrant by itself. Sandwiched in between is the amareno cherry layer, which somewhat tasted like jam. Bottom layer provided a nice crunch to the smooth dessert. 
Quiche was nicely done - buttery fragrant pastry crust that didn\'t overwhelm with a light and savoury custard filling. Portobello mushrooms added a nice depth to the flavour. Salmon wasn\'t the freshest but didn\'t taste fishy. Priced at $6.90. Great as a snack!
If this was a girl she probably ties her hair in a neat braid, wears Cotton On, doesn\'t swear and always brings her home-baked goods to both class and church to distribute, with a customized hand-written note for each recipient. Earnest and pleasant, but maybe a bit too sweet. 3.3/5
.\n<br />|\n<br />Just look at the char-ed bits, need I explain more? .\n<br />|\n<br />Sad to say, there were not many cafes were like them which they placed the taste of their food above the fancy decoration. .\n<br />|\n<br />Humbly hiding beside the famous Creamier, they served one of the best pastries I tried. Not cheap for a neighborhood pastries, but all was worth it. .\n<br />|\n<br />Niche Boulangerie\n<br />Blk 128 Toa Payoh Lorong 1#01-833\n<br />Singapore 310128\n<br />Open from 1100H to 1300H. Closed on tues.
.\n<br />|\n<br />The base wasn\'t too buttery (most importantly \n<br />there was not burnt taste). I didn\'t if it is because of me or the stalls I visited that their crust tend to have a burnt butter taste. .\n<br />|\n<br />Filling was eggy and milky and had a texture of a steamed egg. .\n<br />|\n<br />Very decent pastries in a neighborhood area!
Delicious!! practically everything is freshly baked. The petit croque monseur has a light texture &amp; mushroom is tender!
From Niche Boulangerie, replacing Soleil Chocolate and new neighbour to Creamier Ice-Cream. It\'s no authentic Italian style Lasagna, but this is what I call homely comfort food. The top surface was a bit dry, but the slightly wet layers underneath made up for it, containing generous amounts of minced pork in tomato-based sauce, cream and melted cheese in between layered pasta. What\'s more lovely was the sesame dressing for the greens, flavourful with its aroma that brings a familiar taste to western fare.
The cake was moist and soft, more bitter than sweet, and complemented perfectly by the velvety mascarpone layer. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#dessertporn #handsinframe #vscosg #cafehoppingsg #bonappetit #sydneyfood #foodporn #buzzfeast #foodphotography #instafood_sg #f52grams #bestfoodworld #foodstagram #beautifulcuisines #eeeeeats #dessertsg #whyteworks #foodphotography #buzzfeast #yahoofood #follow4follow #icecream #appetitejournal #tablesituation #foodiegram #DCfoodporn #hkeats #like4like #burpple
The smell is just begging you to dig in asap. It\'s creamy and not too sweet. I quite like this tiramisu ($6.90) from Niche Savoureuse, but I am more on the cheesy side of tiramisu 😋
The owner makes very delicious ice mocha too! \n<br />#nichesavoureuse #sgcafe #singaporeinsiders #exploringsingaporeeats #whati8today #love #yummy #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #onmytable #beautifulcuisines #burpple #topcitybites

plus the barista makes amazing coffee! I love the creamy Carbonara with big chunks of mushrooms, truffle fries and ice mocha. They have a pretty good selection of cakes too so be sure to check it out. Oh wait, did I also mention they have this delicious all day breakfast platter?

Because the normal kueh salat was sold out, we had Kueh Salat with black glutinous rice($4.80).

The puréed chestnuts had flavour, though they were not as sweet, but the Ferrero Rocher filling gave a different type of sweetness and taste to the cake in overall.

Slice of Mont Blanc is quite light. Sweetness just nice. The bits of wafer gives a nice texture to the eating experience.  The Healing Garden (ginger, lemongrass, lemon peel, liquorice root &amp; spearmint) tasted quite mild.

pasta is just 👌🏻! I particularly like the meatballs as they\'re moist and juicy!
Red velvet cake and strawberry shortcake. 😻

The lasagna, named as the real deal, was disappointing. Pasta sheets were mushy and every spoonful fell into one big mess. Taste wise, it wasn\'t too cheesy and didn\'t get jelat. Wouldn\'t recommend this unless you\'re up for some $10.90 reheated lasagna leftovers.

From Niche Boulangerie, replacing Soleil Chocolate and new neighbour to Creamier Ice-Cream. Scones are notably one of their specialties; they serve a variety of flavours here ranging from the sweet to savoury. Bacon Cheddar (Left) is a savoury, came crusty outside yet light inside, had chives inside and slight saltiness from the cheddar. Bacon did not invoke any meatiness in it but the bits did created something to chew. Honey Cinnamon (Right) is a sweet flavour, crumbly and doused in sweetness on its base and a cluster of sweetened cinnamon in the middle.
