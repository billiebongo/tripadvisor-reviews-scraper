The Special TENDON ($13.90+) order comes with a baby chawanmushi, miso soup and a bowl of rice topped with a pile of tempura including green beans, a shiitake mushroom, sweet potato, baby corn, chicken and prawn. Oh, there\'s also a deep fried onsen egg. YUP. 
This is the second tendon that I\'ve tried, the first being the one from Don Meijin. With all the hype surrounding this tendon, I had high expectation for this. Though it kind of fell short as I felt that in comparison with Don Meijin\'s tempura, this isn\'t as crispy. I do enjoy having the egg and breaking it open to mix with the rice. For its price, I think it\'s packed with more tempura than the ones offered by Don Meijin. Can\'t really say that I like this though. Gotta try Tempura Kohaku next I guess!
With the scent of sesame oil, light batter encases a crowd of vegetables that rises well above the rim of a deep bowl of wholesome Hokkaido rice, doused twice over in special housemade sauce ‚Äî a blend of dashi, mirin, shoyu, sugar and water. Pluck apart the pieces to place on a dish and have them hot, fresh and crisp. Optimally flash fried upon order, they lock in taste and sweetness but little grease. Crunchy corn, long beans and lotus root, tasty egg plant, peppers and pumpkin and a yummy round of leafy greens encased in tempura. A bite into the shiitake mushroom, fried taut in its golden jacket, reveals the juicy insides glistening ‚Äî tempting.\n<br />.\n<br />This Vegetable Tendon ($12.90) comes as a filling set with that savoury, eggy chawanmushi they\'ve got going on üòã plus a side of earthy miso soup, full of seaweed.\n<br />.\n<br />http://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/2017/03/11/Vegetable-Tendon
I finally hopped onto the tendon hype and popped by #tendonginzaitsuki for dinner. While not unpleasant, it wasn\'t an outstanding beacon of Japanese gastronomical delight either. It wasn\'t bad. I enjoyed that it wasn\'t too greasy, that portions were hearty and that there was a free flow of pickled vegetables to cleanse my palette. I particularly enjoyed the onsen egg sitting innocently under the towering shrimp and pieces of tempura-ed chicken fillets (though a little dry, they were entirely flavourless). It burst with gooey abandon and brought oomph to the dish. What really stood out though, was the starter that came with this $13.90 set - Chawanmushi. Silky smooth, pudding-like egg with the ability to melt into a rich broth in the mouth. So worth it!
Now, to be completely fair, I came here while I was still pretty stuffed from a hefty late lunch. 
1x oozy egg hidden beneath a pyramid of tempura. They only serve 2 kinds of bowls here - special or vegetables. Another concept by Keisuke - this time no ramen, but TendonÔºàÂ§©‰∫ï) - tempura+don.\n<br />üí´\n<br />$18 for a chawanmushi, miso soup, and a bowl of 2 pieces each of chicken, prawns, long beans, 1x mushroom tempuras and free flow of picked vegetables. Probably not the lightest/crispiest/cleanest-tasting tempura batter found. Still, it is great value and definitely above average. Some love the drizzled tempura sauce. Tempura-lovers to venture, others: alright to try. \n<br />üí´\n<br />The place always sees queues, even on a Sunday at 11.45am, so go early.
Having tried Kohaku\'s tendon last year, I think there are some ups and downs about this tendon compared to Kohaku\'s. What I liked about this is the portion. For $13.90, it comes with a set of chawamushi and miso soup on top of the bowl of tendon. The variety of tendon is fairly similar so at this price range, it is definitely more bang for the buck. The sauce is quite debatable. I personally prefer it less sweet and between Kohaku\'s and Ginza\'s, I find Ginza\'s sauce less sweet and at the same time, it was not added much to the bowl at first to allow us to customise how much more sauce to add with a bottle of tendon sauce in front of us. What I noticed is that the batter for the tempura was a little thicker than Kohaku\'s. It wasn\'t much a difference but it did masked the taste of the ingredient a little. Other than that I still find Ginza\'s more worth while if you have to choose to visit only one. Both of them have long queues, so be prepared to wait for an hour or more especially on dinner timings.
I thought I would much prefer the one at Kohaku cos it\'s spicy but I was wrong! The egg!!! Oooh it was cooked perfectly! I absolutely hate undercooked egg white cos it looks like mucus. Not this one! The white was firm but the yolk was fabulously runny!!!  I was so inspired I even took a video of the egg haha. So I added chili powder (a lot!) and pretended it was spicy tendon. Worked for me. Hubby usually sniffs at tendon but he has been asking for it ever since Kohaku. I wonder if I can order extra egg...
I have ordered the Special TENDON -  2 pcs Prawn, 2 pcs Chicken, Half-boiled Egg, Sweet potato, Baby corn, long beans and Shitake mushroom and this set comes with chawamushi &amp; miso soup. They do have vegetable tempura set too. They also have complimentary pickles that is on the table. At the price of Sgd13.90 (exclude service charge and GST) is really reasonable. This Tendon did not fail me. The Tendon was sooo good and it was not oily at all. The special tendon sauce was drizzled on the tempura and rice that enhanced the flavour to the peak. My favourite is the tempura chicken!!! üêî is the champion! The chicken is so tender, so juicy and so flavourful. It is really the best in the world!! My 2nd favourite is the egg... wooo omg the yolk (as per picture) slurp slurp.. \n<br />P.S. you will smell like a walking tendon though.. hahahaha
Our Special Tendon ($13.90)! The deep fried veggies were naturally fragrant. So fresh were the long beans, mushroom, melon, lady\'s finger and baby corn. Pick them apart and there it is! You uncover that tempura half-boiled egg. Break that fragile blob to let it run over your bed of pearly white grains. If the chef\'s generous drizzling of sweet savoury over your rice and and again over your crisp isn\'t enough, there\'s a bottle of tendon sauce, chilli powder and sansyo for you to help yourself. I sure did. It\'s such umami goodness. The ebi prawns are succulent fresh; the moist chicken breasts are tender as fish. The latter could use seasoning though. The batter is light, using only Japanese flour, allowing the natural flavours to come through. It\'s not a greasy meal despite all the deep frying. Can\'t wait to try the Veggie Tendon ($12.90) next time!
I tend to prefer restaurants with smaller menus, the reason being that I believe in specialisation. Ginza Tendon only has two main items on its menu - Special and Vegetable tendon.
The Special Tendon was fantastic value for money - $13.90 for a bowl heaped with prawn, chicken, vegetable, and an onsen egg. Fresh tempura is the only tempura worth eating, and here you get to see it deftly fried in front of you. Caveat: it\'s best if you\'re a tempura lover because there really is a lot of it, and anything deep fried is just one bite too many away from jelat. Go early, seating is limited and very much in demand.
Finally visited for their much raved about TENDON! Didn\'t have a wait for a seat at all because I\'m kiasu and came right when they opened in the evening. (You should too because by the time I finished the meal, the queue literally snaked to the back of the shop). Say at the counter seats &amp; I hd a first hand experience &amp; got to see the skilled chefs frying the battered tempura to a golden brown &amp; meticulously placing the tempura on the bowl of delicious short grained sushi rice &amp; finally drizzling their signature sauce all over the Tendon. It came with long beans, 2 tempura fish, 2 tempura prawns, mushroom, sweet potato, baby corn &amp; not forgetting a TEMPURA EGG HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE GOODNESS! Really satisfying and fulfilling meal, priced at $13.90 too, slightly cheaper than TENSHO\'s. Everything was close to perfect, from the Chawanmushi, to the miso soup, to the star Tendon itself. Do prepare to wait if you\'re heading here during peak hours! Can\'t wait for my next TENDON meal, seriously! Next stop, Tendon Kohaku!
I came here on a Sunday at around 2:30pm which I found is a perfect timing to come because there is no queue at all! I ordered the special tendon which is a bit too much for me as lunch / tea. The ingredients are fresh and the price is very reasonable (compared with the portion and the ingredients they used). But since the portion is quite big and the food is all deep fried, I may only visit here when I\'m craving for tendon.
PRICE: $13.90++ for Special Tendon, inclusive of miso soup and mini chawanmushi 
So hefty are their servings even the vegetarian bowl fills me up like nobody\'s business. I only wish they included the egg - that would make this perfect.\n<br />For the price, I feel the tempura bowls here are worth the queue and lingering scent of \"eau de deepfry√©r oil\".
Only 1 bowl of don that is covered with mouthwatering tempura (chicken breast, prawns, vegetables) delicately fried  and drizzled with delicious sweet sauce. Value for money at $16 that comes a chawanmushi and miso soup.
After hearing so many people rave about this place, I had to check it out for myself, and it sure didn\'t disappoint. Ordered myself a Special Tendon for $13.90++ and watched the chefs make my order right before my eyes...
Baby Corn, Brinjal, French Beans, Leafy Vegetables, Red/Yellow Capsicum, Shiitake Mushroom, Sweet Potato „Äã$12.90
Tempura Onsen Egg, 2 Prawns, 2 Chicken Breast, French Beans, Sweet Potato, Shiitake Mushroom „Äã$13.90
Tried the special tendon (SGD13.90) that is loaded with 2 ebi prawns, 2 chicken breast, long beans, mushroom and egg. The portion is big and very filling. The fried batter chicken is too dry but the rest were slightly above average. 
What I enjoyed most was the crispness of the batter and freshness of the chicken, prawn and vegetables. Always go for your don first and leave the side dishes (chawanmushi &amp; miso soup) for later. The crisp batter will turn soft in a short time (it\'s just science) and you don\'t want that. It\'s a really fulfilling meal and I can see why there\'s always a very long queue! Pro-tip: Visit on Sunday 1:45pm when you could almost get a seat immediately.
Tempura were a little soggy when served. Would prefer it to be more crispy. The star tempura will be the poached tempura egg.  Value for money. Smelt like a walking tempura after stepping out of the restaurant.
Said no one ever. Well, until they try this Ten Don (S$13.90++) anyway. I was amazed at how tender and moist the chicken was! This bowl of crispy fried goodness was truly a satisfying meal. And at this price, I\'m not surprised there\'s a queue... üòãüëèüèºüòä #dinner #yummy #burpple #feedfeed #sgfood

Super yummy tendon set! I\'m not much of a fan of fried food but I wouldn\'t mind having this again because the tempura batter was light and airy, and it wasn\'t greasy. I also prefer the tendon sauce here to kohaku\'s because it was less sweet, and was lighter tasting. I like the fact that the set comes with miso soup and chawanmushi, which made all the fried food less monotonous. OH and this tendon comes with a nice gooey egg that I mixed into my rice. It was soooo good eaten with the tendon sauce. There wasn\'t much of a queue when we got there at 5.30pm. :)
I guess it IS pretty good. All the tempura items were well done, especially the prawn and chicken breast (yes even chicken breast). Not so feeling it for the baby corn though. Would I come back again? Maybe not on a Friday night. #ginzatendonitsuki #howtonotbefat #burrple
It\'s a delight to watch the Japanese chefs in action as they fry up the tempura on the spot. But 2 hours wait is a bit too long. üòû I\'ll prob only come back if there is no queue.. #Burpple #tempura #tendon #tendonitsuki  #japfood
I was so luck enough to sit right in front of the chefs and saw ALL the process of the don making !! üëåüèºThis $13.90 special don was crisp and moist + juicy?! So good with the special tendon sauce A N D the chawanmushi was so soft and well made. Definitely a revisit soon!! üç§

The queue was immensely long. We queued close to an hr starting at 7pm on a Tuesday evening. But I\'d say it\'s worth it but only if it\'s your first time trying. This overflowing bowl of goodness consist of 2 prawns, 2 amazingly tender chicken, 2 long beans, 2 pumpkin, 1 mushroom, 1 baby corn and 1 egg over a bed of fragrant sticky jap rice. All marinated and deep fried in their savoury tempura coating!

Expect long Q for this goodness! Special bowl: 2 chicken breast, 3 types of veg, 2 tempura!! Credit to the good services and very reasonable price ($13.90) which comes with soup and steamed egg! P.S there\'s perfect poached egg inside! 
Don\'t be put off by the queue - this tendon is totally worth the wait. For only $13.90++, I was presented with an overflowing heap of scrumptious tempura atop a bowl of Japanese rice, as well as delicious chawanmushi and miso soup. The \"icing on the cake\" was most definitely the tantalising tendon sauce that is slightly sweet and goes beautifully with generous dashes of chilli powder. I also enjoyed helping myself to lightly pickled vegetables that balanced the heavy dish. üòã
Late to the tendon party but yknow... the queue was still super long so I guess I\'m not that late. Now that I\'m graduating soon somehow that\'s made me super money-conscious and well yeah, value for money once again. They heap so much tempura on your bowl, you can\'t even see the rice. That\'s how you do it oiishi üòä
Was really surprise by the generosity of the portion.. The tempura were stack so high that the bowl seems too small.. The chicken is tender and moist despite being chicken breast. The prawn was fried to perfection. Tempura batter was very crispy and tasty. But to up the taste level, just add in the tendon sauce! Rice was very good too and  There\'s even a tempura runny egg-yolk too! All sets come with chowamushi and soup and It cost only...... $13.80!
One look at the picture and you can see the ingredients are simply overflowing out of the bowl. Ordered the special tendon set. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of prawns, 4 pieces of vegetables and a half boiled egg. The ingredients are really fresh! It also comes with chawanmushi and miso soup. Total price is around 14 dollars. It is certainly filling and I would give it a 4/5 rating!
Tempura is okay. Chawamushi and Chicken Breast is great. Affordable at $13.90
There\'re only 2 dishes on the menu. The meat and the vegetarian one. But it\'s a bowl of $13.90 goodness! Two large tiger prawns (which were sweet) and two slabs of chicken (tender and juicy; something I never expected for tempura) and mushroom, peas and very sweet thin corn. It\'s a must visit if you\'re a tempura fan. Definitely value for money. 
Feeling üòå cos I get to savour this Special Tendon set (S$13.90, includes chawamushi &amp; miso soup) with less than 15 mins wait. Everything in this bowl is delish, right down to their sauce. Yum!\n<br />-\n<br />The food is fried before your eyes, so you will smell like what you ate. But fret not, freeze is available at the counter to get rid of the odour üòä
Such a big bowl that I couldn\'t even finish all the rice!! üòÖüòã
Sweet eggporn dreams, everybody. Let\'s hope we\'ll wake up to a better day.

The kitchen hood exhaust system did not seem to work. Ventilation was poor.\n<br />It was a 20 minute wait before being showed to a counter seat. Help yourself to the iced water while waiting. \n<br />The tempura was not as crispy and light as I preferred, especially for the chicken tempura which I felt was a bit dry and tough. Not wonder the female sitting next to me, requested it to be replaced with eggplant tempura which looked much better.\n<br />One really stunk very badly after a meal here.\n<br />|\n<br />Ginza Tendon Itsuki\n<br />Address üè† : 101 Tanjong Pagar Road, Singapore üá∏üá¨ 088 522\n<br />Tel ‚òéÔ∏è : 6221 6678\n<br />Open üíà : 11.30am - 2.30pm, 5.30pm - 10pm\n<br />MRT üöá : Tanjong Pagar (EW15)
At $13.90 (inclusive of a mini chawanmushi, miso soup and free flow pickles), this is amazingly good value ‚Äì and there\'s no compromising on taste, either.
Nice affordable tendon! $14 for a set! Very value for $$ but long wait at the queue
Smelling like a walking tempura has never been so ‚Äòshiok‚Äô!
Left this small little shop smelling like walking tempuras but still so, so satisfied. You can expect chicken fillets, long beans, mushrooms, pumpkin, prawns, eggplant and my favorite, a fried onsen egg all in this one bowl. Though all fried, these were surprisingly light and not the jerlat kind of oily. Folding the oozing yolk in the rice drizzled with tendon sauce was the best part. A really value for money bowl served with silky smooth chawanmushi, hot miso soup and free flow pickled vegetables. This will surely fill you up! Their green tea was pricey at $3.80, so stick to plain water if you want to save the moolah. Dinner service starts at 5.30pm but the queue began as early as 5pm. Remember to bring your cash along as they don\'t accept nets or cards!
Still palatable and reasonably priced but they seriously need to do something about the ventilation.
Pretty good value, tasty and filling. Wish it was the crispy type of tempura, though!
When the chef presented us with this gigantic bowl of deep fried goodness it felt unreal. Really yum yum and satisfrying. We waited for a good half hour though. Bring a portable fan. 
Only got 2 main course, Vege 12.90++ &amp; Special 13.90++...Simple and worth for the queue
In fact we like this bowl than the standard tendon, but it\'s a pity that it doesn\'t come with the fried but molten egg. We love the fried spinach!
we were really late for lunch and decided to go for this as there was no queue. the Êñô really gao gao. for me, cuz I seldom eating deep fried food, after a while this becomes really jelat.
This bowl simply turn the tables for fried food for me! Love it how non greasy and oily each piece is, locking in all the flavours the food originally have! The sweet, custardy pumpkin, fresh crunchy prawns, even the long beans are sweet and flavourful üôÄ
We reached early in the morning but there was already a queue! After about an hour or so wait, we finally entered the cosy restaurant but with great ambience! We were seated beside groups of japanese patrons who were raving about how tasty their tendons were! My vegetable tendon ($12.80) came with a cup of silky chawanmushi, free flow pickled vegetables and miso soup!! So worth it!! The vegetables were fresh, juicy and sweet, perfectly fried into aromatic crispy tempura goodness. Ginza Tendon Itsuki uses Japan imported rice to serve only the highest quality tendons! üòçüòç I never thought I will be addicted to deep-fried tempura dons! 
Minus the egg, the chicken and the prawns, replaced with shimeiji, capsicum, lotus root and spinach.
On top of all that, a delicious and wonderful meal. I\'ll definitely be back. #burpple #japanese
Why this is the hottest and most value-for-money tendon in town right now: For $13.90, you get a glorious donburi heaped with jumbo prawns, succulent slabs of chicken breast, vegetables, and a wobbly onsen egg, all fried to a golden crisp laid on a glistening bed of deliciously fragrant (lightly vinegared) Japanese rice. And chawanmushi and miso soup on the side. And a lingering tempura scent/stench on you the rest of the night as a parting gift.
I order \'special\' tendon for $13.90++ which consist of 2 fillet chicken, 2 prawn, 2 Long beans, 1 mushroom, 1 egg plant üçÜ and fried onsen egg. Super filling meal. Be prepared to queue for half an hour and smell oily after the meal. But overall I would say worth trying -M
For a change, instead of the \"Special\" Tendon I\'d gotten on all my previous visits, I decided on the \"Vegetarian\" one this evening. And it was every bit as scrumptious. I am still boggled though by how they managed to fit all of the following on the bowl of rice:
I must have been really lucky to sit in front of the chefs at a table of my favourite number 9.
Nothing to exclaim about taste wise. Just really good prawns and tempura egg. Queue not worth specially for this tempura don. 
Chicken fillet is not a typical dish for tendon in Japan. But it was actually good and goes well with onsen-tamago.
After going on a long quest to find the best tendon in Tokyo, we can confirm that the tendon at Ginza Tendon Itsuki is truly authentic and up to par with the ones we tried in Japan. It was also my first time to try tempura egg, which  still boggles my mind on how it can be made with the egg still runny yet intact. Anyway, we had such a unique and satisfying experience at Ginza Tendon Itsuki. #burpple
Loved the chawanmushi! Even though it was only a small bowl, I loved how it was smooth and filled with ingredients at the bottom. The tendon was so satisfying. 2 pieces of prawn and chicken each. The vegetables were sweet and crunchy. The  sauce also goes very well with the tempura and rice. Affordable meal to have. 
Bowl of goodness with chawamushi that cost like $13.90++ ! Really good!! Cons: the waiting line #goodluck
There\'s only two items on the menu: Special Tendon ($13.90) and Vegetable Tendon ($12.90). The dishes are also served with Chawanmushi and Miso soup. Love the tempura which are lightly batter and doesn\'t taste oily. Plus there a surprise onsen egg in the rice bowl! #bestfoodmemory2015
|\n<br />There is only 2 item on the menu, tempura don and a vegetable don. The only drawback is that you\'ll probably reek of oil after that, like a walking tempura üíÉüèªüç§
With only two options to choose from the menu, going for the special set was a no brainer (unless you\'re vegetarian then the other set is for you). It\'s essentially a tempura don meal, served with chawanmushi and a bowl of miso soup on the side. At $13.90, this was so worth it. A lot of tempura was given, from shrimp, pumpkin, chicken, mushroom, and the best of all, a poached egg. This would explain why the waiting time could be up to half an hour. But I would say this is worth the wait. The drinks are on the expensive side, so asking for water is preferable. 
Price:$13++. Verdict: YES. Pls go if u r in the area (and if u have the time to queue). Priced at $13++, this tempura don is arguably one of the most affordable tempura don I\'ve had. Despite being so affordably priced, the serving size remains very generous. The special set had tempura prawn, chicken (albeit the chicken is a little weird), mushroom, corn, and several other vegetable. The runny tempura egg is really the icing on the cake!! Loved it. And besides the tempura don itself, you will also get chawamushi (which was really well made too!!) and miso soup. Be warned though, the drinks there are quite expensive. The green tea (that\'s not refillable) is about $4 per cup. So perhaps you r better off getting iced water if you are on a budget. Another issue I had with this establishment is the queue. My friends and I queued for about 1 hour on a weekday afternoon!!! And it was after the usual working crowd lunch period (we started queuing at about 130pm)! So be warned and do not expect to be able to casually stroll into this restaurant like you would in any other restaurants. I would likely visit this establishment again, but perhaps not so soon because it seems like it has only 2 food options - vegetable set tempura don, or special set tempura don. I guess it\'s an inevitable trade off between variety and quality. 
Featuring huge portions of tempura prawn, chicken, vegetable and a runny soft boiled egg! Sauce wasn\'t overpowering which was good and the rice was cooked to perfect white beads. Be ready to brave the long queue and oily interior though! Worth it imo.
Only two choice: Special or Vegetable Tendon, with net price: 13.9 or 12.9 ; My love are the baby corn and shrimps
The tempura batter was nice and crispy but I couldn\'t really taste the freshness of the ingredients. Guess I can\'t be asking for too much at this price. The idea of chicken tempura was a bit odd although it was executed alright. Reminded me of Long John Silver\'s. Texture and flavor of the chawanmushi was exceptional though.
My definition of a good Japanese food starts with its steam egg! If they can\'t even get a simple egg dish done properly, I can\'t imagine the rest. Anyway, this one comes with the tendon and it\'s considered very well done. Serve fast and hot, portion are good too.
Singapore\'s first tendon restaurant. They only have 2 choices  for you, special or vegetable so you don\'t have to worried want to have. Just flip a coin! Oh, the special thing about this restaurant is they actually provide fabric odor spray! Special right?!?! #dontsayineverwarnyou Wahahaha! #superhapxfood #tendon #burpple
$14.90 for the special set 
Dwarfing the bowl was the sheer quantity of deepfried items. While I felt the tempura battered coating could have been slightly crunchier, I loved that it\'s light and remarkably grease-free. Every item cloaked in the batter was also of very good quality. In fact, I couldn\'t resist extra orders of the baby corn ($1 each). 
You need to be really confident that a single menu item concept can take off before you take such a risk. Judging from the queues daily, we know Keisuke-san had succeeded.
With only 2 choices to choose from, vegetarian or special, without a doubt I went for the latter. A hearty bowl of tempura prawn, chicken, egg and some vege with their special concoction sauce.\n<br />The only downside? You will walk out smelling like Tendon as well.
Fried food is my weak spot always so I naturally love tempura! I like how they have many different types of fried food (prawns, chicken, mushroom, long beans, corn, pumpkin, EGG!) Thought it was really quite value for money - abt $18! I like how the sauce is drizzled on the tempura and the rice but I thought some can taste quite dry or oily hmms How nice this is will depend on your expectations of it in the first place and which other tendon you compare it with - regardless I confess I\'m biased towards this! (: Appreciate their complimentary chanwamushi as well cos of the Miso sauce taste on it haha prefers this more than those which taste eggy hahaha just a personal pref! (:
OH MY Â§© DON! The portion of the tendon is huge! 2 big prawns, 2 pcs of chicken, vegetables (long bean, mushroom, pumpkin and sweet corn) and *drum roll now pls*... ooooozesome onsen egg! All these for just abt $16 after including GST and service charge. üò≤
Surprisingly addictive! I prefer the Vegetable Tendon over the Special Tendon as there were a variety of ingredients chosen, like the eggplant, lotus root, sweet pumpkin, shiitake mushroom &amp; bell peppers..(just to name afew) We waited for half an hour for this bowl of goodness but it was all worth it! üëçüèª ($12.90)
[$13.50] One of my favourite place to dine when I\'m on a tight budget + when I\'m very hungry üòç\n<br />The atmosphere at Ginza might not appeal to most due to its poor ventilation, hence \'smelly\' ‚òπ, but the tempuras sure do! From tempura corn to chicken and the most loved tempura prawns, you\'ll definitely be satisfied with their generosity of variety! \n<br />Love the tempura sauce too! üòçüç¥\n<br />~\n<br />Overall, IMO: 3.7/5
There\'s only two items on the menu: Special Tendon ($13.90) and Vegetable Tendon ($12.90). The dishes are also served with Chawanmushi and Miso soup. Love the tempura which are lightly batter and doesn\'t taste oily. Plus there a surprise onsen egg in the rice bowl! #bestfoodmemory2015
Braved the queues and haze to try out this tempura joint by the Keisuke team. The portion of tempura is generous and literally overflowing. The ebi was ever so fresh and the tempura batter was pretty good in all honesty, although if they could improve the ventilation t\'would be great. 
2nd day in a row dining at a #Keisuke outlet. LOL #ginzatendonitsuki
($16.35 after taxes). The friendly neighbor of mine had been eating every weekend since it opened and hence invited me to enjoy this \"Tempura Don\" with him. There was free flow of \"Japanese salad\", served with miso soup, Chawamushi and a main tempura Don. The Chawamushi was pretty tasty, the \"tempuras\" were well fried, with its shrimps being fresh, chicken tender, mushrooms crunchy, eggs fried to the right state. Overall a pretty good meal with only the fact that the chicken was a bit too bland for my taste buds. A warning though that it is really filling with that amount of rice they provide! 
For $16.10 you get 2 prawns, 2 pieces of juicy chicken, vegetables, chawanmushi, miso soup and a runny fried egg!! There\'s also pickled vegetables for the table that kinda taste like kimchi minus the spice. Still a good deal even though the batter was a little soggy
($13.90++ before gst &amp; service charge) You would understand the hype about this bowl of tempura goodness as you sink you teeth in the fried batter of tender chicken breast meat, succulent shrimp and crunchy corn. The generous portion of beady Japanese rice here would sent you right into a satisfying carbohydrate coma. Set comes with chawamushi and miso soup side! Definitely a meal option if you are looking for something heavy around the area and are prepared to wait! \n
13.90 for generous amounts of tempura drizzled with a fragrant soya sauce over firm properly cooked japanese rice. SHIOK!
Two types of Japanese Tendon are available!
This delicious special tendon draws a lot of crowds every day so be prepared to queue, but I tell you, this is worth my 30 mins of queueing! It is topped with piping hot crispy tempura onsen egg, 2 pcs of chicken fillets, 2 huge prawns, thin slices of pumpkin, green beans and brown mushroom beautifully arranged on a bowl of rice, drizzled with their house sauce. It is so delicious and worth the money together with chawanmushi and miso soup but on the downside, be prepared to walk out smelling like a walking tempura.
With a very simple menu of only 2 choices, I had [Special Tendon S$13.90] which comes with chawanmushi &amp; miso soup! Worth it! Thanks to @karlnch for coming early to queue!
Comes with 2 chicken breast, 2 prawns, shiitake mushroom, corn, long beans, pumpkin &amp; a tempura onsen egg. I was most impressed with that chicken breast which was tender &amp; juicy even though it was fried! This bowl definitely has everything that it needs, with that onsen egg sitting in the middle. It was quite interesting to watch the chefs co-ordinating to prepare the bowls, as the vegetables &amp; meat are fried separately. Be prepared to walk out with the oil stench due to the open kitchen concept. At this price tag, I would definitely come back when I feel like indulging in tempura! 
Check out the video, that\'s why I always choose to sit at the counter.
The folks behind Ramen Keisuke have recently launched Ginza Tendon Itsuki in collaboration with Tokyo\'s famous Ginza Itsuki Sushi. Brave the formidable queue (we heard the Friday night wait lasts more than two hours!) and go for their Special Tendon ($13.90) with onsen egg, shrimp, chicken and oh-so-many veggies ‚Äî shiitake mushroom, pumpkin, corn and lady\'s finger ‚Äî atop pearly rice drizzled with a sweet and savoury sauce. All the tempura is battered and prepared fresh on the spot! Bear in mind though, the smell of cooking will blanket your entire being, and you\'ll walk out an unfortunate stinko minko (and every bit worth it).
My rule of thumb is that if there is a queue forming even before the store opens, you can expect the food to be decently good (at times) and I was not disappointed with my Tendon at Ginza Tendon Itsuki and that includes the whole dinning experience. Sitting at the counter, I was so excited by the sight of the Tendon being assembled in those elegant Arita porcelain bowls and just all the smells.
Heard raving reviews about this place and was looking forward to it cox I\'ve had a really awesome bowl of tendon back in Tokyo. But gotta say I was kinda disappointed. The pricing is attractive though. There\'s only 2 choices of tendon on the menu. The special one which is mixed tempura bowl containing shrimps, chicken long beans, baby corn, onsen egg and pumpkin. The other one was a vege tempura bowl. Batter wasn\'t really well made. The inside of my tempura was slightly soggy. The sweet sauce drizzled around it didn\'t taste too bad though. Whatever it is don\'t bring your date here unless you happen to be in the area. The queue and the standards here aren\'t enough to impressive her. At least mine wasn\'t üòÖ
Faced with only 2 choices, Special Tendon and Vegetable Tendon, my carnivorous trait was more than resolute to pick the Special one and I was fully satisfied! 2 chicken cutlet, 2 large ebi, 2 french beans, 1 pumpkin, 1 mushroom and 1 onsen tamago -- all well-battered and dip-fried into perfection. My first time enjoying tempura so much!
A very JAPANESE ambience. Worth the price and really good tempura. Comes in a set with the don, miso soup and mini chawamushi. Quality food || $13.90 
The tendon here is crispy but not oily which is rare for deep fried stuff. Choices are limited, it\'s either meat or no meat. But look at the stack of stuff in my bowl. The sauce is everything! Just pour a generous amount on everything and enjoy. \n<br />Monster definitely loves this place and all its crispy bits. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Generous portions for the price and comforting but don\'t expect world-class tempura or authentic Japanese hospitality. Came with two large chicken cutlets, two french beans, two large prawns, a slice of pumpkin, an onsen egg and baby corn (that was reminiscent of popcorn). 
*thumbs up* for the food. With such a simple and no frill menu (only 2 items to choose), I guess you don\'t have to worry abt ordering the wrong choices. #burpple
The onsen egg provided surprise and amusement and the various tempura elements were lightly battered and suitably pleasurable ‚Äî if you ignore the bitchy gossip circulating audibly about how the chicken is not as thin and likable as the fish ex-wife and that the tendon certainly traded down ‚Äî but in manner of a dog marking its territory, the restaurant will set loose a most greasy, choking, sesame oil-esque fragrance which will envelop every inch of your body within five minutes of you being seated, and this will unforgivably mar the experience ‚Äì not even a trip to the nearby 100AM Fitness First for some judicious and out-of-control spraying of Adidas sports deodorant from armpit to toe will take away the possessive grip of said insistent smell. 3.5/5
When I came across this place on burrple and food blogs, I couldn\'t believe that their tendons are priced at $13.90. And I visited them last night, I was so amazed by its portion. 2 tempura ebi, 2 pieces of tempura chicken, tempura veggies - pumpkin, lady\'s finger, corn and shiitake mushroom and a tempura onsen tama under all that tempura mess! People say that it is the best in town, and I totally concur that. The ingredients are so fresh and the batter is light and crispy. You know how thick batter are so jelat after it is left for awhile, but nah that\'s not the case for Ginza\'s tendon! And their tendon sets come with a mini chawanmushi and miso soup. Their chawanmushi is definitely THE BEST I\'ve ever tasted. It is so smooth and so rich, so good I can\'t even. This is definitely worth the queue and every cent you pay. Oishi, I can\'t wait for my next visit already! 
One word: FRESH; freshest ingredients freshly fried on order. There were prawns, chicken breast, mushroom, ladyfinger, pumpkin and onsen egg; yes, the very egg with runny egg yolk! Every mouth of it was tasty till the last. Oishƒ´~ üòãüòã
The folks behind Ramen Keisuke have launched a new tempura concept, Ginza Tendon Itsuki, which is a collaboration with Tokyo\'s famous Ginza Itsuki Sushi. Brave the formidable queue (we heard the Friday night queues last more than two hours!) and go for their Special Tendon ($13.90) with onsen egg, shrimp, chicken and oh so many vegetables ‚Äì shiitake mushroom, pumpkin, corn and lady\'s finger ‚Äì atop pearly rice drizzled with a sweet and savoury sauce. All tempura is battered and prepared freshly on the spot!
$13.90 for a generous serving of tempura rice bowl. Cubes with chawanmushi and miso soup! Filing and yummy! üç±üç§üçÜüåΩüéÜ
For $13.90, there were quite lot of varieties in this small bowl. Prawns, chicken, ladies finger, mushroom, baby corn and egg. There was even a chawanmushi and miso soup which came with the set. The only thing to take note was that they charged $3.80 for the hot green tea which I find a bit too expensive. 
We queued for almost 2hrs on a Friday night. Almost died of hunger so I am not sure if I find it yummy cos I was super hungry. Anyways, I ordered the special set and serving size was generous. Oh I love the chawamushi that comes with the set. I will come back again if the queue is not crazy long. Note: drink cost $4 regardless if it\'s coke or normal hot tea (we weren\'t informed about drinks price and was surprised when bill comes up to $20 each) .also, this place smells like fried food so....u will definitely smell like fried food after eating. 
This comprised tempura prawns, chicken, onsen egg, shiitake, pumpkin, corn and lady\'s finger on Japanese rice and drizzled with tendon sauce.  You can order additional items on an ala carte basis.
A golden surprise hides beneath the mountain of tempura üç§ in this donburi rice bowl. $13.90! üç≥üç≥üç≥üòâ 
Only 2 options: vege set or special set (seafood &amp; chicken) all in about $20 per pax. Huge portion.
Wow, I still cannot believe we can have this quality Japanese food in Singapore!! I hope those seasoned Japanese chefs stay here and keep this quality for a long time. This newly opened Tendon restaurant has only two options in their menu. Special Tendon (13.90) and Vegetable Tendon (12.90). We ordered Special Tendon, which came with 2 fresh prawns, 2 pieces of tender chicken breast, 1 pumpkin, 1 Okura, 1 mushroom, 1 baby corn, and 1 slow cooked runny egg. Everything was carefully cooked by chefs who are cooking in front of you behind the counter table. The tempura skin is not thick (the cheaper tempura always disguise the size of prawns with thicker skin), and the Tendon is topped with a little sweetened but nice sauce. One bowl was really big to finish, and overall experience was really satisfying. 
Price is reasonable as it comes with chawanmushi. And I am surprised that the chicken meat is v tender. However, might want to avoid going there if you have a date following that. Smells like walking tempura after eating there.
Passed by yesterday but the queue was so long! Thankfully there wasn\'t any when I went (but when we were done the queue grew again). From its quality and portion, this is pretty value-for-money at $13.90. Tendon served with Chawanmushi &amp; miso soup. Chawanmushi was really smooth. Batter was light without overpowering the taste, freshness and texture of ingredients. Quite amazed by the tempura egg and its oozy yolk, but it was a little bland. So was the chicken. Its texture was tender despite being deep fried. My favourite is probably the mushroom, sweet pumpkin and prawns. Loved that the mushroom was so juicy, a good contrast with the crispy batter. Menu is limited to two types - special (2 prawns, 2 chicken, egg, 4 veg) or vegetables. 
$13.90++ for an 8-piece tempura don, with chawanmushi on the side is ridiculously cheap. And you\'ll definitely be full, because they\'re generous with the tempura: 2 chicken fillets, 2 shrimp, 1 shiitake, 1 lady\'s finger, 1 sweet potato, 1 corn. Oh and a deep-fried tamago! I could do without the slow-moving queues, but I\'ve no complaints about the food. But why oh why, does a mug of NON-REFILLABLE green tea cost $3.80++? When there\'s also iced water on the house? To upsell to the $9++ beer? Okay, I\'d have taken the bait if I\'d known earlier that the tea\'s not refillable. X= \n<br />PS. Oh why is the location name backwards?\n<br />#tendonginzaitsuki #burpple
They managed to tempura the onsen egg too. A word of caution though- not a place for a date because you will come out smelling like a deep fryer.
Now before you say a thing, tempura chicken breasts exist and this is by far the most tender chicken breasts I have had in my life. At one point I was like \"Hm what fish is this?\" THAT tender. Make sure you join the queue early, ideally before 6.30 pm. And oh yes, only two variations on the menu- special (with meat) or vegetarian. Comes with a small serving of chawanmushi.
Plus surprise, it comes with a tempura egg! \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/07/09/tendonginza/
Here, you can look forward to authentic Japanese Tendon ‚Äì Special Tendon (Tempura Rice Bowl) and Vegetable Tendon (Vegetable Tempura Rice Bowl) creations.¬†
first concept in Singapore! \n<br />it came with 2 prawns, 2 pcs of chicken, 4 pcs of vegetables (shiitake, pumpkin, ladyfinger and babycorn). find a surprise right in the middle - a tempura poached egg!\n<br />I had the luxury of sitting right in front of the tempura bar counter, and observed how they battered the prawns and chicken and fried on the spot. so yes, freshly made! \n<br />it was my first time having tempura chicken and it was really soft despite being deep fried! though after awhile it got a bit tasteless, so I kinda spam the meat with tendon sauce. the rest of the tempura items were really fresh and crispy with a thin layer of tempura, not oily at all. overall, it was indeed a steal for the price. \n<br />just one thing to note, everyone who walk past you after that will probably think you are the fried tempura - as if u moisturized yourself with the batter and fried yourself. had to bathe twice after the visit. \n<br />great to catch @misstamchiak anyway!
Super worth it cos at $13.90++ you get a super filling bowl of tendon, (2shrimps 2 huge chicken breast üëÜüèª 1 pumpkin 1 corn 1 mushroom 2 longbeans and 1 soft boiled tempura egg), chawanmushi, free flow preserved cabbage and a miso soup! That\'s a lot for just $13.90!! üòµüòµüòµ\n<br />Spot the Egg in the next picture! Best eaten when mixed into the rice. -\n<br />Ingredients used were rather fresh and it didnt feel oily, but the batter for the tempura wasnt as crispy and tasty as I expected it to be. Still, for that price, it\'s still value for money and worth a try! üëçüèª\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #eathealthy #burpple  #dinner #sgdinner #ebi #japanese #japanesefood #tendon #tempura
Been here to try both the special tendon and the vegetables tendon and..... They are both so unforgettably good. Furthermore, as a meat lover, this veggie tendon was refreshing. There\'s about 10-11 pieces of vegetables,  from mushroom, corn, eggplant, long beans to lotus roots. Each is so crisp and fresh on the inside. Also, the generous amount of tendon is worth raving for. Will be back, but do note that you will smell like tendon (which you can easily smell two streets away!)
The guy who came only at 5:40pm even finished his bowl before I get mine. So unfair. Wasn‚Äôt very happy with their service. \n<br />#unhappycustomer #badservice #dissatisfied #tendon #japanese #tanjongpagar #burpple #burpplesg

Usually, I\'m not one who would queue to fill my stomach but I was curious what was so special about this restaurant which only served 2 items on its menu.  About 30 minutes later, we were shown to our seats.  I ordered the Special Tendon which was a generous serving of prawns, chicken, assortment of vegetables and half boiled egg, over rice.  One bite, I was sold.  The tempura was not overly greasy and the sauce was indescribable, just the right sweetness.  The set came with chawanmushi and miso soup too!  At $13.90, it\'s definitely value for money\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#friday #dinner #japanese #food #tempura #yummy #sgeats #tanjongpagar #foodie #burpple #instafood #foodstagram #foodpics #iphonography #iphone6
Maybe with the recent spade of restaurants offering Tendon, the exclusivity has gone. With that being said, they still offer Tendon bowls that are still pocket friendly and non-pretentious. I mean what\'s there to complain when the bowl consist of tempuras which are made up of 2 prawns, 2 chickens, vegetables and a perfect onsen egg! \n<br />All these for just $13.90! Wait, did I mention that Miso soup and chawanmushi are included with the set!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#ginzatendonitsuki#japanesefood#tendon#fried#tempura#prawntempura#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Both options come with chawanmushi and miso soup. $13.90. Green tea on the side costs $3.80 (not refillable). #burpple #tingzieeats
In fact, possibly only 2 types of tempura dons a day. However, you will also not fail to find a queue outside despite its limited menu. \n<br />Reason was the tempura they specialised in was really good. Ingredients were fresh and fried upon order in front of customers. The tempura batter was thin, non-greasy and so enjoyable. Drizzled with their tempura sauce before serving, each don was generously packed with a variety of prawns, fish, chicken and vegetable tempura. And the serving was filling for any adult person. \n<br />My only slight complaint was that the rice could be better and more fragrant. But then, it was a small issue with all that tasty tempura. The chawamushi that came with their set was amazingly good, smooth, silky and flavourful. Compared to many others, the tempuras here were recommended for a taste closer to Japan. #burpple burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #tempura #japanesedon

Thanks to my Bros who brought me there. Queued for at least an hour before going in and I must say it\'s worth the wait. We were seated right in front of the open kitchen. It\'s a feast for the eyes seeing how the chefs masterfully prepare this awesome bowl.
The restaurant only serve 2 variety of don. Though delicious and well comparable to its japanese counterpart, 1h of wait seems a little too long for me\n<br />#japanese #tempura #tendon #sgfood #burpplesg #burpple #tanjongpagar

2 options on the menu - special/vegetable tendon; this one is the former. I enjoyed the tempura initially but after awhile it became too soggy for my liking. I finished the whole bowl though üòà
Assorted vegetables like lotus root, pumpkin, shiitake mushroom &amp; eggplant. Topped with additional fried onsen egg ($2.50).\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Definitely a must-go for tempura lovers.

For $17, you get a jumbo sized \"special tendon\" where double servings of prawns, chicken fillets, shrooms, French beans, pumpkin and eggplant are piled on top of steaming Japanese rice, chawanmushi, miso soup and free flow of pickled veggies on the table. \n<br />#tendon #tempura #japanese #whati8 #whati8today #saturday #japanesefood  #hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #burpple #foodie #foodies #sgfood #sgfoodunion #burpplesg #instasg #foodporn #foodstagram #instafood #foodcoma #gastronomy #iweeklyfood #8dayseat #whati8today #instafood

Verdict: indeed very filling for the portion serve but after which it makes you feel very greasy and I saw many did not managed to finish their order too. Guess this is not our cup of tea to revisit. \n<br />#cuisineparadiseeatout #tendon #burrple #ginzatendonitsuki
Special Don Set ($13.90) which comes with the Tempura Rice Bowl, chawanmushi and miso soup. The bowl is so filled with the assortment of tempura food that you would practically need to unload them on a side plate before u can start eating. Its also nicely plated and in a pretty bowl no less. I had say its quite filling, with chicken breast meat, lady\'s finger, prawns (note its plural and the prawns are q big as you can see for yourself), egg, and eggplants. I had gladly return but its pretty packed during lunch hours so come around 1.45-2 to avoid queuing. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #yummy #nommom #feedfeed #onthetable #food #sgfood #foodporn #latergram #foodgram #foodpics #foodie #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #TSLmakan #singaporeinsiders #instafood_sg #igdaily #igers #igsg #8dayseat #whati8today
Not really a fan of egg puddings but this was surprisingly good. üëç Or maybe i was really hungry.

So it seems the concept behind the tendon-only establishment is the brain child of Keisuke-san. (again!) If you have been in the area, you know he already have Tonkotsu King, Gyoza King, Takeda Shoten (a sake bar) and Tori King (a stone throw away at 100AM) helm under his name.
woohoo! S$13.90++ only! üç§üç§üç§ #burpple #vsco #vscoeats #vscocam #igsg #sgig
$13.9 for the special tendon,which comes with 2 big prawns, 2 chicken breast fillets, one stick of mini corn, one mushroom, some long beans, one slice of pumpkin and one deep fried egg. The tendon was value for money, but as the kitchen is an open concept kitchen, the smell of the oil can be overpowering and nauseating
Delicious 
Overrated 
The contrast of liquid softness with freshly-fried crunch is to-die-for! #veronicaphuaeats #ginzatendonitsuki #tendon #eggporn #burpple #japanesefood #instavid #instafoodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #BurppleTastemaker
It looks small but it\'s a lot. Must eat. #Burpple

Made up of 2 tempura prawns that are juicy and crispy, 2 pieces of chicken breast meat that is so moist and tender that you could mistake it as fish and assorted vegetables such as pumpkin, corn and mushroom. The batter is light and drizzled with their secret formula seasoning. Not to forget a hidden tempura egg just above the rice. Easily affordable at just $13.90 and absolutely scrumptious for a highly acclaimed dish!
My appetite was also constantly satiated with counter seating where we could view the 3 chefs meticulously preparing the battered ingredients for frying. üç§üçöüòã
Cos the batter was thin...it didnt do much justice to the prawns. Turned out to be not so crispy. The vegüçÑüçÜ however were my fave as it was crunchy n \"vegeful\"üòÑüòÑ. Go with an empty tummy cos it is a huge serving #tempura #vegetables #japanese #sgfoodie #burpple #opensnapeats #openricesg @hungrygowhere @8days_eat #tfjsg50
Yet another franchise by Ramen Keisuke - as much as I love their ramen, I love their tendon even more. The chawamushi which was served part of the set is by far the best I ever had. I\'m not even a chawamushi but this gets me craving for it at times. The tendon, served with its generous servings of the array of meat and vegetables, is fried and mixed to perfection. The egg is definitely something not to be missed too. Gawd, just thinking about it makes me hungry again üòÖ
2nd time here üòù
SO full after.
Best I\'ve ever eaten. Even the onsen egg was tempura-fried! The chawanmushi that came with it was super silky smooth
Very reasonably priced @ $13.90++ though.
Special Tendon üç§ or Vegetable Tendon ‚òùüçÉ. Hehehe tempura batter was thin and crispy and only $12.90!! üòçüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª LOVE THE PUMPKIN. All rice bowls come with chawanmushi, miso soup, and pickled vegetables üç•
Yet another new concept by the same folks behind Ramen Keisuke, this small shop space focuses more on serving affordable Tempura dons. There is only two to choose from; Special or Vegetable. The former came with Tempura Mushroom, Corn, Lady Finger, Shrimp and Chicken, as well as a runny egg and sides such as Miso Soup and Chawanmushi. Each piece of tempura comes crisp and surprisingly lightly battered, coated in Tendon sauce which is savoury but doesn\'t overwhelm. All of the tempura is good, but I have a particular liking for the chicken in particular for how tender, juicy, succulent and even soft it was. The only bad thing is the ventilation, which leaves you smelling heavy of fried food after leaving the premises.
Scored counter seats too and that meant that we could see the chefs cooking and putting together our dons right in front of us after we had just sat down üòçüëçüèªüéåüç§üçöüç≤üçµ
