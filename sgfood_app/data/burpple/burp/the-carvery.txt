The Carvery CNY special will launch on 10 January 2017 and available till 11 February 2017. Known for their premium meats, you\'ll get to feast on three prosperous roasts and delicious items such as\n<br />- Crispy pork belly with apricot ginger sauce\n<br />- Honey-roasted leg of lamb\n<br />- Salted baked chicken\n<br />- Flower crab stew\n<br />- Roasted duck with yam croquettes - Persimmon fruit compote\n<br />- Yuzu trifle
A meal at The Carvery is not complete without having the trifle for dessert. For Chinese New Year, the trifle takes on an Asian twist and transforms into a light and tangy yuzu flavored one! Layers of limoncello soaked sponge cake are tiered between yuzu scented whipped cream, custard and yuzu jam before being topped off with almonds and mandarins. I appreciated the citrusy notes that refreshes my taste buds after such a meaty meal!
The limelight of our dinner was this Crispy Pork Belly!!! Each layer delivered their own characteristic — crackling skin, tender meat, melt-in-your-mouth fats! Have it with the sweet apricot ginger sauce to cut down on the greasy-ness and you\'ll be good to have multiple servings of it!\n<br />The Chinese New Year Revelry is available from 10 Jan - 11 Feb 2017 at $45/pax for lunch and $55/pax (Sun-Thur) and $62/pax (Fri &amp; Sat) for dinner and slightly pricier on 27, 28 and 29 Jan.
This is amazing.. it rivals the texture of many of the best around, including sio bak at hawkers or porcetta at Italian restaurants.\n<br />🔸\n<br />At the topmost layer, the skin is cackling while being light and airy; At the middle layer you get juicy and melty fatty pork; At the bottom layer you get the leaner cut with, unfortunately, a hint of gaminess but it was not overly salty. Eat all three layers at once and you get the balance of crackle, flesh and fats all at once.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Absolutely love this, but because the meat would toughen and skin would lose its crisp after sitting for too long, you should attack this as soon as you see it. This is taken during an invited tasting. CNY Revelry Buffet available 10 Jan to 11 Feb.
I especially like the fatty layer of this lamb here, which was juicy with hints of herbs and a stronger garlic flavour. The interior was still pink so the flesh was tender. Overall, what you get is crispy fatty herby skin with a tender meaty interior.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting
-\n<br />Featuring Spit-Roasted Chicken with Tarragon from #TheCarverySG\'s Black Forest Christmas Feast (available till 1 Jan 2017).\n<br />-\n<br />Weighing 1.8kg each, the tender and juicy chicken is also available for takeaway at $38+ each (or $68+ with a bottle of wine). Good for year-end parties. PS: Advance order of 3 working days required.\n<br />-\n<br />MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE!!!🎅🎄🎉🎊🎁\n<br />-\n<br />#thecarvery #parkhotelalexandra #christmas2016 #christmasfeast

When I first heard of Yorkshire Pudding, I thought it would be something like a bread pudding and this is as a surprise to me (we all learn something each day) especially when I was told to pair it with meat gravy. \n<br />Totally would try this again, the pudding crust is light and fragrant while hollow inside (making it Super airy!!).

Meat lovers, you might want to take note of this value-for-money deal. The next time you and your friends are planning to bulk up on meats, head to this all-you-can-eat concept at Park Hotel Alexandra (just next to IKEA). The Carvery\'s dinner buffet ($52 on weekdays, $62 on weekends) temptingly includes oysters and pork, but the affordable priced lunch buffet provides excellent value. At $38 (with a 10% discount for Citibank cardholders!), you get unlimited servings of premium roasts and cuts like House Aged Beef Ribs, Rotisserie Chicken and Lamb — all freshly sliced at the carving station. Start with a plate of healthy greens at the salad bar and then move on to the hot foods. Load up on carbs at their pasta and pizza counter. If not, end your meal on a (very) sweet note with their wide selection of desserts and go for the homely Apple Crumble if it\'s available — it\'s like a hug on a plate!\n<br />Avg Price: $45 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Amber M

I love The Carvery’s trifle that is available as a dessert in their regular menu and this Christmas, the trifle is transformed into a Black Forest Trifle! Think layers of chocolate sponge cake, dark chocolate mousse, brandy soaked cherries, whipped cream and custard all coming together into one mouthful. I especially like the dark chocolate mousse which was a little bittersweet and the brandy which gave the dessert an extra kick and overall, it was tied in nicely with the whipped cream.
Soaking in some early Christmas vibes last night at The Carvery — Park Hotel Alexandra with a preview of the \"Black Forest Christmas Feast\" menu available from 12 December 2016 - 1 January 2017.\n<br />We ended with some desserts and this was the Buckwheat Crepe live station, dressed with toppings of your choice. Soft and fragrant crepe with unlimited berries, peaches and that Nutella spread, what\'s not to love?
Including Crown Roast of Pork, Spit-roasted Chicken with Tarragon, US Black Angus Beef, German Potato Pancakes, Kenyan Beans &amp; Chestnuts and Spicy Maple Pecan Crusted Trout. Can\'t wait for dessert! 😋\n<br />#TheCarverySG #ParkHotelAlexandra

I\'m definitely in for these fluffy Yorkshire Pudding with truffle butter ✌2nd pax now dines at 50% off, till end sept. #thecarverysg
One of the most prized cut, the prime rib of grain-fed beef is from the back of the upper rib section of the steer and is loved for its rich and robust flavour. The beauty of this roast lies not in the premium selection of Australian beef but Chef Robert also dry-ages it to intensify the taste. Cooked perfectly to medium rare, the meat was carefully slow roasted at a controlled temperature for some eight hours to give the nice and tender texture.
☺️ . \n<br />I love my meat, but I love it even more with the house made truffle butter!!😋👍🏻 Read the full review of #TheCarvery on my dayre! 😊 (50% off for 2nd diner from now till end of sept! Don\'t miss this good deal!) #parkhotelgroup
One of the best breads tried at a buffet, these fresh loaves are handmade from scratch from daily free of any forms of additives. With the fermentation of the natural yeast, it results in a very palatable chewy texture on the inside and a golden brown crisp crust to coat. Spread some of the truffle butter for extra oomph!

Imagine Pork Knuckle, House Aged Beef Rib and Rotisserie Chicken all freshly cut by the chefs right before your eyes! Pro Tip: don’t hold back on their free flow truffle butter or salt, and generously slather them on your meat for a truly indulgent experience! The buffet runs all day err\'day for lunch ($38) and dinner ($52).
If life is like this everyday... 😇☁️ Sorry to be featuring these warm &amp; fluffy [Yorkshire Pudding] which goes so well with their homemade truffle butter. Really want to tabao the truffle butter home 😱 and the Yorkshire puddings too. ⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />➊ Lunch 12pm to 3pm Daily S$38++ ➋ Dinner 6pm to 10pm Sunday to Thursday S$52++ ➌ Dinner 6pm to 10pm Friday &amp; Saturday S$62++
Another meat dish that this buffet place got it right is the roast beef. Very tender and if you talk to the chef who carved the meat he can recommend very good sauce for it to suit your taste. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 28
For a buffet place The Carvery makes really good pork knuckle. Crispy skin and most importantly tender and moist meat which many places can\'t get it right. Yummy. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 28
So I made my own way down to try the buffet. Because I\'m a carnivorous cave woman 😈, I love my meat. We were served roasted lamb, beef and chicken that afternoon. What I did was smearing normal butter(I asked the staff for it) and sprinkling the truffle salt all over the juicy meat. SO GOOD. Yes, I eat my meat #likeaboss. 💁 The desserts were very very decent as well for the price!There is a 50% discount off for the second person(daily), promotion ends in September. Super worth it. My plan is to hit the weights in the gym and get some sun-tanning by the pool before eating the next time. 😂😂 WOOT!💪#EileenWantsToCampHereForever #TheCarverySG #OngsLaiJiak #FatFatMeatSeries #Buffet #Meat #Burpple #ParkHotelAlexandra #ParkHotelGroup #Paleo
That means, Happiness is going to @parkhotelgroup\'s Carvery buffet because the stars of the buffet are MEATS. ROASTS. PROTEINS.
Amazing roasts (GOT TRUFFLE BUTTER AND TRUFFLE SALT HOR) with a quality spread of sides. Wow did we mention about the Trifle? GOSH. That must be the best dessert I\'ve had at a buffet!
Rotisserie Chicken.
A carving station buffet with beef lamb chicken and decent range of sides. But the most craved food is this dessert, like a catchy song getting stuck in your head for weeks. Their service was exceptional, fully attentive to clearing plates and arranging napkins, waiving charges to a drink which we thought was included in the buffet, ferrying of guests with umbrella in the rain, etc. So in the end we nominated the waitress who served us in the feedback form.
A selection of premium roasted meats such as in house aged beef rib, lamb leg, pork knuckle and tender rotisserie chicken. |\n<br />In addition, there is also a line up of side dishes which accompany the assortment of meats, including fresh seafood and a pizza/pasta station. Out of the beef, chicken and pork knuckle, I honestly can\'t decide which is the best. 😍 Truly a meat lover\'s heaven. |\n<br />// This was a hosted meal. Thank you @parkhotelgroup for having us and the cocktails by the pool 🍸
Overlooking the rooftop pool, #TheCarverySG on level 7 newly-opened Park Hotel Alaexandra is every meat-lover\'s dream come true with their selection of 3 to 4 premium roasts and cuts daily. Prices starts $38 for lunch, $52 for dinners on Sunday to Thursday, and $62 for dinner on Friday and Saturday.
And can\'t wait to dip into the crystal blue swimming pool for a swim! The Carvery had opened at Park Hotel Alexandra last week, serving quality cuts of chicken, beef and lamb or pork!
We loved the perfect view of a deep blue swimming pool right in front of our eyes!

The theme of \"Hearth &amp; Heat\" aptly tells the story of how these cuts and dishes are smoked with hickory and mesquite firewood while the heat from the grill gives it a charred flavour. Diners can expect to see Argentina ribeye, hickory pulled pork, Australian lamb shoulder, honey lemon chicken, BBQ bean stew, charred leek soup and roasted pineapples being prepared right on the grill. Price of an adult diner starts at $52++ for lunch and $62++ for dinner.\n<br />•\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @parkhotelalexandra.\n<br />•\n<br />The Carvery\n<br />Address: 323, Alexandra Road, Park Hotel Alexandra, Level 7, Singapore 159972\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #thecarverysg #sixthsensepr

Other than the roast pork, the rest tasted pretty ordinary.. or rather the roast pork is a league above the rest.

The Roast pork is cut upon request and delivers a crunchy bite with nice proportion of fats and lean meat. It\'s taste is generally quite subtle, but once paired with the sweet apricot sauce it becomes a perfect blend of musical harmony for the tongue!☝🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#buffet#thecarvery#roastpork#siobak#shaorou#pork#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Huge, juicy and surprisingly tender Turkey lay in wait for us in its wholesome bareness. A tray of warm, fresh Yorkshire Puddings - its compatriot.
Be enthralled by the hive of activity across the live-cooking stations as the skilful chefs take pride in serving perfectly roasted cuts right out of the rotisserie.\n<br />There is also a scrumptious spread of side dishes and greens that complements the premium meats so come by now and relish the gastronomical delights.\n<br />My favourite is definitely the honey roasted ham. The tender succulence with that tinge of sweetness is incredibly appetising and will keep you raving non stop.
Christmas is coming! Have you made your reservation at the carvery?\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #bonappetit #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #10likes #beautifulcuisines #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #foodspotting #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders

.
But HAPPINESS is when I was able to make it to another tasting together with the clan brother!\n<br />~\n<br />-\n<br />The star of the buffet - Five types of quality beef, each of different cuts and from different countries. My favourite would be the Mayura Full-Blood Wagyu from Southern Australia. The cattle are pasture-raised at the beginning stages of their lives. As they are \"grain and chocolate-fed\" beef, the marbling and fats are evenly distributed, resulting in its juiciness and tenderness. So good to eat this on its own, with just an additional pinch of truffle salt to elevate the sweetness of the meat. I had five huge slices ok!😜😋\n<br />~\n<br />-\n<br />BECAUSE I\'m a see-food(I mean seafood) lover as well, I need to attack everything under the sea!This was just the first of multiple rounds.......\n<br />#EileenFoodTasting #Eileen吃不肥#EileenWantsToCampHereForever #Buffet #TheCarvery #ParkHotelAlexandra #ParkHotelGroup #Meat #Beef #Seafood #OngsLaiJiak

At this buffet, you will get a variety of other choices like seafood, roasted chicken, pasta and desserts to go along with your beef selection. I love the truffle butter and the red wine sauce to pair with my yorkshire pudding! Buffet prices start from S$78++ to S$88++. You can thank me later. haha #thecavery #singaporeinsiders #topcitybites #stfoodtrending #exploresingapore #meatlover #onmytable #sharefood #beautifulcusines #nikonsg #nikon5500 #burpple
With me here is Yorkshire Pudding, an English food made from batter and is often served with beef and gravy as part of the traditional British Sunday roast! #yorkshirepudding #yummy #thecarvery #meatlover #love #fatdieme #onmytable #topcitybites #exploresingapore #beautifulcuisines #stfoodtrending #sharefood #nikonsg #nikon5500 #burpple
This photo in itself induces massive anabolic gains. Bar none, the best place to get your fill of meat - so much better than the churrascarias out there! Postworkout feed at Singapore\'s buffet haven for carnivores - pork knuckle, bone-in Wagyu ribeye, Wagyu tenderloin, and rotisserie chicken. Plate one of many... #thecarvery @parkhotelgroup #sgfood #sgfoodies #meatfest #burpple #yum #delicious #whati8today #FengFeeds #gains #sgeats #sgfoodies #parkhotelalexandra #protein #paleo #primal
(which is the whole thing lah)
Nothing much... Just free flow prime rib to keep the metabolic fire stoked. ;) Best buffet ever if you\'re a fan of meat. Beats all those churrascarias hands down. I don\'t need no singin\' passadores... Just give me the meat! #thecarvery #thecarverysg #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #myfab5 #protein #primerib #meatfest #burpple #yum #delicious #beef #foodporn #eatbigliftbig #FengFeeds #sgbuffet #parkhotelalexandra
Rough on the edges but with deep, mellow flavours... Hands down, the best apple crumble in Singapore I\'ve tasted so far. Apple slices, candied orange peel, and plump raisins infused with a liberal sprinkling of cinnamon, nutmeg and star anise... topped with a delicious crumble topping -- loads of flour, butter and sugar in decadently chunky form. Best with a spoonful (or two) of warm vanilla sauce drizzled on top. Only thing that could make it better -- a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. This is the bee\'s knees, I\'m telling you! #thecarvery #thecarverysg #parkhotelalexandra #applecrumble #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgdessert #sgbuffet #dessert #whati8today #burpple #myfab5 #yum #8dayseat
I started with more Seasonal Oysters, some very scrumptious Cod Fish in Fruit Honey Broth, a small scoop of deliciously unique Duck Confit Rice, a small piece of Beef and Seafood Velouté.
 The seafood was fresh and delightful; especially the springy salmon sashimi and tiger prawns.
I personally prefer the \"For Him\" cocktail as its more refreshing, \"For Her\" on the other hand is sweeter. Call me the man👨🏻

Whatever. 💁Loaded on my zinc and protein intake on my third visit to The Carvery buffet at Park Hotel Alexandra. How could I forget the unlimited servings of truffle butter as well? 😍 Best meat buffet of the year 2015 for me. \n<br />Heard that there is a Christmas menu coming up too like Spiced orange roasted duck, Coffee roasted baby back ribs and the Apple and brandied prune trifle. Got to miss this due to work AGAIN 😫😭. WHY.

anything chocolatey! this Chocolate Mousse at The Carvery is clearly too small to satisfy my sweet tooth(s) though. will probably need at least 7 to be equivalent to any one of P.S. Cafe\'s choc cakes! I guess I can only end the night with dreams of my chocolate desserts now 😭 @parkhotelgroup @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #buffet  #chocolate #chocolatemousse #dessert #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #latergram
it is very tasteless yet very tasty at the same time! to be honest, I had no idea what I was supposed to do with that \'hole\' in the middle but the carver explained it was best eaten with roasted meat and accompanying condiments! [💭 hmmmmm. so it\'s like a savoury muffin?] anyways I listened to the professional and WOWWWW! it was so good with my red wine jus, some mustard and horseradish! so good, I really wanted them all! 😵 @parkhotelgroup @igsg #igsg #singapore #thecarvery #buffet  #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #yorkshirepudding
there were some hits and misses in other dishes and there were definitely not too many choices on other types of food but I feel that the quality of the meats were more than enough to make up for what The Carvery lacked. here\'s the Beef with Veal Jus (I also tried the Red Wine Jus after and it was equally as good), the Rotisserie Chicken with Gravy and the Pork Knuckle meats with Mustard. here, I gotta stress on how goddamngood that crackling pork skin was! omg I couldn\'t resist having seconds and thirds! seriously, everything on this plate is enough for meat lovers to step foot into this restaurant 🍴🐮🐔🐷 @parkhotelgroup @igsg #igsg #singapore #buffet #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #thecarvery #roastedmeat #roastbeef #roastchicken #porkknuckle
the carver had a well of knowledge on the three choices of meats available (chicken, beef and pork) and did an excellent job in suggesting the type of condiment(s) to go with each meat. there were so many at the table, it was a little overwhelming for the uninitiated. the carver was extremely friendly and patient, and I enjoyed every suggestion he gave. I was also lucky to have been the first in the restaurant so I got to choose the yummiest parts 😋 @parkhotelgroup @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia #singapore #buffet #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood @sgfoodie #thecarvery #roastedmeat #roastbeef
Then Yorkshire Pudding would be one of the best gifts, especially if it\'s accompanied with herbed butter.

Truly the best dessert I\'ve had in a buffet! 😍 ah, Carvery, I\'ve never craved for a buffet this much before!
Soaked in brine overnight, the extra labour pays off in spade when it comes to extraction of flavours and the extra moisture of the meat makes it so easy to consume and leave you wanting :)\n<br />#roastchicken #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #parkhotelalexandra #thecarverysg
