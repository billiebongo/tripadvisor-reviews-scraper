White Rabbit Lava Cake (SGD $6.50) - A matcha sponge oozing out with our childhood creamy flavor of 大白兔奶糖 and topped with a homemade crispy black sesame 贡糖. A nice twist to the usual lava cake. Surprisingly the lava cake is not as sweet as you might think and the flavors complimented well with each other.
How about a game of \"Jenga\" at Out of the Cake Box?
Its delicately pretty looks belies a divine rose fragrance and an intense lychee flavour. How not to fall in love you tell me 😍
Incorporating the Chinese element into a French classic, the Financier contains wolfberries, melon seeds (a.k.a. \"kwa chi\") and dried longan. A box of 8 costs $16.80 nett.\n<br />Not to be outdone, the Pineapple Tarts which come in spherical form, have a surprise of \"attap chee\" hidden within. Cute idea but honestly, that amazing melt-in-the-mouth, rich-in-butter pastry and well-balanced pineapple filling are more than enough to make me go \"Mmmmmm!\" 😋 They retail at $23.80 nett for a round box of 19 pieces.
Probably needed a warm hug before being served, as it was rather frosty. Horlicks may have been on medical leave that day, as I tasted only Kinder Bueno manning operations. 3.5/5
great cakes here :-) a very small space though, best for takeaway! pictured here: rose lychee, belgian chocolate and matcha opera
Open for dine-in orders not too long ago is Out of the Cake Box, a cakery specialising in homestyle cakes and bespoke creations. Besides crafting lovely cakes, their choux pastries filled with crème of locally-inspired flavours are particularly noteworthy. Try their Earl Grey-Kaya Gnome Dome or Horlicks Gnome Dome - filled with Horlicks and hazelnut crème pâtissière. For more sweets of local flavours, there\'s also their Chendol Fudge Cake, made up of layers of gula melaka sponge cake and alternating layers of gula melaka fudge. You ought to head down soon for a taste of some out of the (cake) box creations. See what we did there? ;)
Finding western sweets too typical with flavours too predictable with common tastes such as Chocolate, Vanilla or Salted Caramel? Out of The Cake Box is pretty much out of the box with their creations, from Choux Puffs with Horlick ganache fillings to Chendol Fudge cakes made with Gula Melaka from the sponge cake layer to the jelly right at the top, and their flavour combinations do actually work well with each other for tastes that you would not forget. Previously just a takeaway shop, they have since added a new table for dine-in patrons who might also be willing to have a bake or two with a cup of coffee to go along.
Out of the Cake Box names their Choux Puffs as Gnome Domes. There were two variants available during my visit; a chocolate version and a Horlicks-flavoured one. Naturally chose the latter, which also comes with hazelnuts within. The Choux was crusty; probably too crusty for its own good because it was too stiff to separate using a fork. However, get into it and you will find a thick Horlicks Ganache that\'s creamy and surprisingly not heaty that has bits of hazelnuts for a bit of chocolatey and nutty touch. Pretty interesting combination of flavours indeed!
Here comes the local take on it.\n<br />Light and fluffy base topped with strawberries, grapes and of course watermelons. \n<br />The juicyness of the fruits make this dainty cake really refreshing and the hint of rose scent in the cream adds a touch of elegance.\n<br />.\n<br />🏣45 Telok Blangah Drive 01-173 Singapore 100045\n<br />.\n<br />🕚Opening Hours: \n<br />Tuesday to Saturday: 12.00 am to 8.30 pm\n<br />Sunday: 10.00 am to 5.00 pm\n<br />Closed on Monday\n<br />.\n<br />💲Cost: $5.50\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #igfood #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #igfoodies #foodgram #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #vscofeed #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #exploresingapore #singapore #singaporefoodie #burpple #burpplesg

The signature cake from Out of the Cake Box has all the essence of chendol with green rice flour jellies, azuki beans and atap seed in between the alternate layers of soft, moist coconut sponge cake and velvety coconut cream.\n<br />The light brown layer of gula melaka on top of the cake provides the final flourish.\n<br />The best compliment you can give to this cake is that it is almost a perfect replicate of the original chendol.
Loved the special touches they put into some some of our familiar items and presented them out of cakes. The Chendol Fudge was, as its name suggested, cake inspired from the Nonya dessert. The Takoh Belle had the original Thai Takoh corn dessert decorated on top of the cheesecake, beautifully fused with Takoh elements. Certainly not the usual type of cakes and their range of cakes looked set to attract many, from young to old, with some interesting combinations of new and familiar flavours. \n<br />Only at their new outlet at OTH, all 2nd cakes are going for 50% till the end of Nov 16. #burpple  #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #chendol #takoh #cheesecake

Out Of The Cake Box has become one of my favourite bakeries in Singapore, and it\'s not hard to see why. Nowhere else will you hear unique orders for a White Rabbit Cake ($6.50) or to dabao a Durian cake in a bag - Bao Jiak ($6.50). My favourite - White Rabbit -  is a matcha lava cake dripping with creamy White Rabbit Candy sauce, which tasted suspiciously similar to condensed milk. The cake itself is strong in matcha flavour without being overwhelmingly bitter, and had a soft, spongy texture that contrasted well with its crust. See what  else we ordered in the full article!\n<br />.\n<br />Check out the full review at http://eatbook.sg/out-of-the-cake-box/\n<br />.\n<br />Out Of The Cake Box\n<br />Address: 45 Telok Blangah Drive, #01-173, Singapore 100045\n<br />Operating Hours: Tuesday - Friday 12pm to 8:30pm, Saturday 12pm to 9pm, Sundays &amp; PH 10am to 5pm\n<br />.\n<br />Writer / Video talent: @heytheredreamer\n<br />Videographer: @donnnut

I failed at trying to make conversation with the owner😅; so let the picture do the talking instead :)
