The taste and the texture is great &amp; the sweetness is just right. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Finally had the chance to try the red velvet and carrot cakes here... and they didn\'t disappoint! Will be back again (if I\'m in the area)! 
A certain blogger once mentioned tat Lynn\'s serves great rainbow cake..I beg to differ the cake was a tad to dry the birthday girl didn\'t like it...10 marks for prettiness tho...
You never need an occasion to justify eating cake, especially not at Lynn\'s Cakes and Coffee, where the cakes are moist and flavourful. They do classic cakes well, with a spot on cake-to-frosting ratio. If you\'re looking for great Red Velvet, Carrot Cake and Rainbow Cake, look no further. Their display case can have up to 12 flavours of cake at any one time, including other popular items like the Dark Chocolate Heaven and Salted Caramel Cake ‚Äì you\'d be spoilt for choice! Albeit slightly inconvenient, it is worth the travel. Prices range from $5.50 to $8.50.
$6 each for a regular sized slice. The cream cheese frosting was very evenly spread and thick enough. The cakes were rather fluffy too. The cafe was rather tranquil and relaxing.  
There\'s something about flowy and dribbles on cakes that tempts you to order it.
Lynn\'s does have a moist piece with distinct fresh carrot strips. Certainly one of the best offerings. Now, what should I have for dinner?
This dish is slightly spicy, with the black pepper added to the dish. But it was overall a good plate of pasta, one that i would go back to the cafe for!
Cuppa time at new joint. #burpple #5s. Their kopi seed from Chye Seng Huat.
The Rainbow Cake that left me hunger for more! This is so good &amp; yummy. There\'s different flavor for each layer of color, and its not overly sweet and not jelat at all!
A very decent piece of Carrot Cake that seemed rather fresh. Amount of mascarpone cheese was enough for the cake, with the cake being slightly crumbly somehow. There was however a lot of carrot bits included, which we appreciated. Probably one of the better Carrot Cakes out there.
A rather unique cake which is steamed instead of baked, it is based on the recipe of the owner\'s mum. Somewhat resembled a sticky date pudding, it also contains raisins for a nice chew. A cake that must be tried if available.
simple yet cosy environment to relax in
flat white. on contrast, the cake taste better.
red velvet cake. definitely one of the better ones out there!
A tinge of lime ‚Ä¢ Not too strong
Not too sweet ‚Ä¢ Just nice

These cakes are really worth the price! 
Paired with a cup of 6oz single shot latte [$5].

The #peppermint #cupcake is my pacifier. But red velvet is definitely not as good as @daintydolce\'s.
