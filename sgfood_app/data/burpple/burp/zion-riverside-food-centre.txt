This plate of fried white carrot cake has the crispyness that i always craved for whenever i eat carrot cake! They have a $5 option where you will be served half of white carrot cake and the other half,black carrot cake. I did not order the black as i am not a fan of the sweet sauce and white carrot cake is good enough for me. It taste unique and can tell that the kway is hand made as it is softer. The stall is owned by a friendly hearing impaired couple and would definitely be a good place to try good froed carrot cake!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Quite a good serving for the price. With extra egg, this cost $4.50. Has a wok taste, lards and a whopping generous servings of 20 hums!! oh yes I counted. Worth a try. 
From braised duck kway chap, char kway tiao, fried carrot cake, prawn noodles to chicken wings. This hawker has best of all worlds! The kway chap ingredients are tender and fresh, char kway tiao with \'wok hei\' super Yums! 
Taking a slow stroll down to Zion Food Centre has somewhat become a weekend routine for us. So much more variety here. This stall is famous for their Hokkien Fried Noodles and this Teochew-Style Fried White Kuay Teow (S$4). Good wok-hei, lots of crispy fried lard! 😝
Braised Duck with various ingredients. Comes with Yam rice. Price reasonable and tastes great. One of the best we have tasted so far. 
A good plate of char kway teow served are only achievable when cooked with the heart besides using the right tool.
~ Chang Jiang Bian Shang ( Sichuan Cuisine ) ~ 12 Smith street Singapore ~ Ph : +65 622 51518 ~ sejak makan chicken sichuan di Hongkong sm @fhung pengen cari lagi yg mirip2 😆 teteup susah...yg Hongkong tetep The Best 👍 thanks LF
Best prawn noodles ever! Prawns are fresh, huge and the soup is amazing. Worth a trip here and it\'s so convenient! My bi-monthly trips here never disappoint! Uncle is really friendly and jovial. 
We all know this is one of the best in town you can have. Located directly opposite GWC (Great World City) and also to be known as one of the oldest hawker centre in Singapore. The western is a must to try, despite the food takes longer than usual but be thoughtful that the folks serving you, have been here more than 20years! 
I heard ppl saying there\'s a new Thai BBQ &amp; Steamboat stall at Zion Riverside Food Centre, so I went to try it out.Turns out it was a worthy trip!! The stuff there are fresh and tasty,especially the pork belly and garlic chicken👍👍 would recommend anyone that read this post to head down there and give it a try!!
We all know the places to have prawn mee but sometimes it\'s good to have something authentic than overcrowded stalls that served a bowl of prawn mee that is ridiculously overpriced!
A combination of black and white carrot cake. But the black wins hands down for this. Bestttt black carrot cake so far it\'s like caramelized! Sweet, crispy and slightly charred. The white one, on the other hand, lacks the fragrance though still quite crispy
Just had a sudden craving for laksa out of the blue, and lucky for me - found it at a corner stall next to the long-Q big prawn noodles. Not the best I\'ve had, gravy was a little watered down, but pretty happy with this S$3 bowl of steaming hot bee hoon. Generous serving.
All my favorite food from Zion. Sinful but really good. Some thing that is worth your calories 
One of my long time favourite - traditional teochew Bak Kut Teh. I\'ve been eating this since I was a little girl.
Indonesian style Grilled Ayam Bakar, checking out a new stall at Zion Road Hawker Centre. #instavideo
No pork lard, but one of the best and most fragrant Cai Dao Kways in Singapore :)
Comfort food for the rainy day. What\'s your comfort food?
Because i had a disappointing one last night, 😋❤ thanks love, cravings satisfied, can last me a week already! Now I\'m craving for tiramisu lol! (Stall 13 S$7 for 2 persons serving)
Red Tea Longan @ Zion House of Desserts. Great for cooling in this humid weather. Bloody hell hot.
Late night dinner with Burpple boss. Drive to several places before deciding on this one.
Not very photogenic but definitely a good plate of noodles! So much \"wok hei\" and if you look close enough you can spot the pieces of deep fried lard 😁
Lau Goh Fried Carrot Cake, owned by a hearing impaired couple.
The aroma. The cilink clank of the spatula hitting the wok.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Perennial fave of many. One of the popular charkwayteow around. Long time have not had it. Sad to say it was not what it used to be. It is tiring work for ckt uncle. The only thing I liked was the taste of wokhei. Other than that, today\'s version was alittle dry and lacked the charkwayteowyness (if there is such a word).\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />My list of beloved charkwayteow has gone shorter.
Serving is generous and the cockles are fresh. May not be the best char kway teow around but you can never go wrong here!
It fell short of my expectation sadly because the skin easily broke apart and it lacked the fragrance that I was looking for hohoho. I think I\'ll stick to ordering fried gyoza instead of guo tie in Singapore 🙃\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />💲: $6.00\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #makansg #sgfoodies #instafoodies #instafood #foodies #foodstagram #foodgrammers #sgfoodgrammers #indofoodgrammers #jktfoodies #guotie #kuotie #zionfoodcentre #zionroad #asianfood #sgculinary #eatoutsg #burpplesg #burpple #BurppleMajulahMakan
My first time trying this stall at Zion Hawker Centre. It was decent, just a tad disappointed that it has MSG.
I kinda like all the food @ Zion Road Hawker Centre 🎯 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#carrotcake #sgkopitiam #sgfood #localsgfood #eatoutsg #sgfoodporn #sgeats #sghawker #sgfoodie #hawkerfood #foodie #foodporn #exploresingapore #foodinsingapore #sgfoodies #foodsg #stfood #foodie #instafood_sg #sgeat #foodphotography #sgfoodpics #burpple #sgeat

This stall at Zion Hawker Centre makes the most awesome dumplings and spicy wantons. #wanton #spicy #zionroadhawkercentre #sgig #sg #bscc_hawkersg #burpple
In actual fact I was hunting for bakchor mee but ended eating wanton noodle.\n<br />🔼🔼 This bowl of mee looked so plain and innocent. I thot I made a mistake. The char siew appeared roughly chopped and  as if it was not roasted long enough. Seasoning is so old school. I requested for extra chilli without realising that the chilli is actually the component that made the noodle stand out. It was fiery spicy.. yup yup... eating it caused a tear or two to slowly well up in my eye. But that was just it. Besides the chilli and the chunky wantons, the rest were forgetful. \n<br />#wantonmee #noodlelover #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #sgig #burpple #openricesg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #sgfollowers #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #discoversg #igfollowers #igfoodies #instafoodsg #instafollow
Determined not to be overcome by this irritant, I set out to satisfy a craving.\n<br />💧💧\n<br />My all time favorite...prawn noodles. Gianomous prawns over yellow egg noodles, garnished with thin slices of pork belly. Accompanied by a big bowl of soup. Distinctive prawny taste and sweetness of the pork bones.\n<br />💧💧 I remembered I had this moons ago. The chilli then was spicier and had a more robust fiery kick. Today\'s version was much milder and felt it was just ordinary noodles with chilli. The seasoning seems to be lost. The broth was nice and sweet but I attribute it to added monosodium glutamate cos I had an unending thirst that lasted till now.\n<br />💧💧\n<br />So sad. Craving not satisfied. My hunt will continue.\n<br />#lunch #prawnnoodles #noodlelover #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #burpplemessyeats #stfoodtrending #narratrs #sgig #gastromony #singaporeeats #discoversg #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #singaporefood #tripadvisor

Which are your other fav stalls?
I think used to be at Adam road. $10. With 3 prawns halved and one pc of pork ribs. Kinda expensive with the prawns not really big at all. However I saw bigger prawns on the shelf of the stall. Nice broth, gets nicer as you eat. Worth a try. 👍 #sgfood #sghawker #foodporn #burpple #prawnmee #prawn #igfood #sginstafood

18 Fried Kway Teow strikes a balance between sweet and savoury without being too dry. Definitely one of the best ones around.
The taste was not bad and the custard did really 流! 👍 if you want to check it out, it\'s Dim Sum Wang at Stall 22 ✌️
