Rich, indulgent and only cheesecakey in its gooey texture. The Oreo-esque crumbs hiding below the cake assist in taking the edge off the sweet hazelnut richness. Essential that you share, otherwise it would be a richness that eventually segues to misery. On an unrelated note, my dining partner told me that a couple also having this cheesecake had a Rocher 1.8x bigger than ours and I was so incensed, I wanted to take the serving board and throw it at the wall. 3.7/5
Chunks of lobster are tossed with chopped celery in mayo before being piled on to your bread of choice and finished with arugula. I am returning for this for sure. #AndWhy #lobstersandwich #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #halal #halalcafeSg #halalcafe #instafoodsg #burpple
Moist, melt in your mouth cake with fragrant buttery crust which goes really well with the cake. Drizzled with coconut infused caramel sauce. \n<br />Vanilla Cheesecake ($8.90) - slightly pricy imo, but worth a try at this 3 day old NY(&amp; why) retro style cafe along bali lane. Check out their interesting non-alcholic mocktail that still retains the alcoholic taste.
&amp; why does it have alcoholic taste when its a mocktail (non-alcholic)? A bailey like non-alcoholic drink with chocolate and marshmallow and that nutty ring around the cup.
Dry weather expected to last for 2 more weeks at least. - ST
They serve mock tails which are pretty unique and at the same time i love their cheesecake! Really well done and I am sure the rest will agree with me. Have a great Monday everyone! üòâ
From And Why, a New York inspired cafe owned by I am ... that is situated at Bali Lane in between Honeycomb and Stateland. Using lemon, thyme and Dijon mustard to marinate the chicken, the chicken has a smoky yet zingy flavour which is also sufficiently tender, with lime mayo flavouring up the bread since it\'s smothered in between the chicken and bread in this open face sandwich. You can opt for salad or chips, but I guess the salad would have been a better choice; the house-made chips felt terribly limp and seemed to have trapped oiliness in between that makes it hard to bite.
From And Why, a new cafe at Bali Lane that is owned by I am ... serving mocktails and sandwiches. Vanilla Cheesecake is from the same supplier as I am ..., and it is smooth, light and creamy with vanilla aroma within the slight tart cheesecake mousse. Really luxurious dessert.
Cold Brew is made up of Guatemala Puerte Verde beans, so the cold brew here is pretty strong with its acidic body.
.\n<br />Prepared to medium well, the meat may be a little overdone for some but I find it pretty nice probably because I don‚Äôt take raw food. One of the sauces (peppercorn) is done especially flavourful, making it an addictive goodness.\n<br />.\n<br />==========\n<br />üìç&amp; Why\n<br />30 Bali Lane\n<br />(S) 189967\n<br />==========\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#steak #halal #beef #sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple  #wishuponatart_eats

SGD 8 - Smells like shisha üò≤ 
the buns were well-toasted, patties slightly charred, making them crisp on the outside and therefore fun to munch on, and they came with different stuff such as Truffled Mushrooms, &amp; Turkey Bacon with Chipotle Mayo üòã @andwhyatbalilane @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia #singapore #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgcafe #sgcafehopping @cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood @sgcafefood @sgfoodie #sliders #burger

#andwhy #salmonandmash ! Frankly speaking, I prefers fresh cooked salmon O er smoked salmon provided that the salmon is fresh. I like this oven baked salmon! Sprinkled with a bit of sea salt &amp; when eaten with the olive paste... I like it a lot! Every bit of it feel healthy and fulfilling! The greens are so fresh and nice while the polenta mash has that light potatoes crunch to it.  Nicely done! \n<br />This turn out to be a surprisingly enjoyable brunch! Next... Is the cat cafe nearby...

Even despite I left it there for a min or 2 after it was served. But I can still distinctively taste the good beans they used even tho the hot water they used caused the coffee to tasted a bit burnt.  Thus a mixed feeling... If only they used a lower temperature. \n<br />#breakfast #brunch #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife #cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeegram #coffeeholic #coffeelife #coffeelove #coffeelover #coffeelovers #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #lunch #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #sgcafefood #burpple #singaporeinsiders #andwhy #andwhyatbalilane
No comments needed...it must be good as I never seen her finished a full baguette sandwich by herself before! I managed to sneaked in a few mouthful of the #nachos with their homemade #salsa and boy...it is surprisingly good! Especially the salsa which tasted rather different from those I had before! Nice tangy, sweet, spicy &amp; refreshing!
Arab Street... I remember going there regularly every weekends a couple of yrs ago until it became so crowded with tourists &amp; hipster wannabes. Lol!
I think I can come here everyday to chillax üòÅüòÅüòÅ
something new in the neighborhood at bali lane.
