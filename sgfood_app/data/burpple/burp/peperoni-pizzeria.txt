This place is fast becoming my favourite pizza chain in Singapore!
Happy international women\'s day! Appreciated her time with me although it\'s just a very quick one. Their food is good anyway. Olio, the cheesy pizza and fries wings. Overall: 3/5.
Head here with your hungriest family members for Peperoni\'s 21-inch Family Pizza ($55). The XXL pizza feeds a group of four to six people, and you can choose two flavours (from 18 choices) to have on the same pie. Try the Proscuitto Crudo di Parma (Pork), with thinly sliced parma ham and a generous portion of rocket leaves, and the Pancetta, served with cured bacon, cherry tomatoes and that very Instagrammable wobbly egg in the centre. If your family can really eat, add on the Frutti di Mare Pasta ($25), or the Lasagna ($22) to share, and wash all that down with an ice cold Gunner cocktail ($7). P.s. Be sure to make reservations on weekends. They also have another outlet in Binjai, which is quieter. \n<br />Avg price: $30 per person
Food that makes you slurp and burp. Seafood risotto, egg plant parmesan, portobello mushroom with red wine sauce, squid ink pasta and calamari
Ribs are fatty.. Sauce is nice but I dun understand why there\'re bits of bitter and chared stuff... Rather spoil to the entire dish.. 
Gnocchi is softer than your yearly tang yuan... Dun bother to try...
Coming in at 21 inches, this pizza is a sight to behold. On one half we had parma ham with a heaping portion of rocket, and on the other was suprema (which wasn\'t as good as the ham). They were quite generous with the ham, although the pizza itself was not very impressive and was a little soggy in the middle, probably due to its size. Having said that, it could definitely fill up 5-6 people, and overall not too bad. 
Who doesn\'t love a heaping portion of fried calamari rings? The calamari was cooked just right, and not overdone and rubbery like most. The batter was crispy, flaky, and so good that you could just eat the crumbs on its own. Served with mayo and spicy salsa, it makes for a great starter. 
Price was really good and the pizza was simply divine , will def go again to try their drinks menu 
My favourite place to have my pizza fix!!! üçï and the best part is you get to opt for the largest pizza (at least in SG) if you\'re up for it :) 
21\' is not just for tvs, it can be for pizzas too! and at mere $50, this as big as your tv pizza feeds a party of 4 - 6. why settle for one flavor when you can have best of both worlds - half Pancetta (Pork) Cured bacon, sliced tomatoes &amp; egg and half Prosciutto Crudo di Parma (Pork) Parma ham &amp; rocket salad. cause mutated pizzas, i think xmen dines here too. lol
pizzas are not the only big thing in peperoni pizzeria. the mushrooms here get an upsize too. one huuggee palm size deep fried portobello piece ($18) with olives, tomatoes in arrabbiata sauce. stained and soaked with the very savory tangy red wine sauce, the fried batter remains welcomingly crunchy and lends such enjoyable texture when it meets the full on juicy and flavorful mushroom on the inside. amazeshrooms really.
6 men, 3 XXL Pizzas. Anything in excessive portions is bound to make one gag at the thought of taking another bite. Especially too much cheesy pizza. Quattro Formaggi, Fruitti Di Mare, Pancetta, Prosciutto Crudo Di Parma, Salmone and Diavola. In general, Peperoni\'s serves up decent pizzas at affordable prices. I wouldn\'t make a special mention for any pizzas but one of the dishes I never fail to order is the entr√©e of Mozarella Fasciato Con Prosciutto which is a delightful combination of pan-fried Mozarella wrapped with Parma ham. I think I\'ve had enough of pizza for the next few months. And yes, I think I\'m well deserving of the certified glutton title.
Here\'s a 21 inch pizza that fed the 5 of us (3 guys 2 girls) comfortably. Love how we could choose 2 kinds of toppings on one pizza! The pizza was delicious. I especially love the very very garlicky sauce on the frutti di mare half. They were also really generous with the toppings - look at the heap of mushroom and ham, and seafood including prawns, squid and mussels (that are not very noticeable in the photo). Service was also friendly. Waiter who served us exclaimed \"are you ready for pizza???\" when he served the pizza, and brought us a jug of \"vodka\". A great place for big groups of friends and family :)
Have you ever seen a 21-inch pizza? If you haven\'t, you\'ve got to try it at Peperoni\'s. It\'s always fun to see how excited everyone gets when they\'re served the gigantic pizza. Choose 2 different toppings to better please the group, a must-try topping is their Parma ham &amp; rocket salad. You\'ll be so satisfied eating at Peperoni\'s, you\'ll be scheduling your next visit even before you leave!
This was large size but it wasn\'t as large as I expected.  
it\'s real good, like really real real good! the yolk is still runny btw!
Super authentic thin crust pizzas at affordable prices. Get your pizza fix here. 
All we knead is love.\n<br />I just kept on coming back here.  #burpple #restaurant #singapore
The pizza place I go to with big group of friends or family. Always manage to satisfy my pizza and pasta cravings. 
The warmth and comfort of wood fire pizza allows one to have an enjoyable time spent with friends or family. For this thin crust pizza you are able to choose two different flavors of pizza to your choice. The one I chose is both sweet and savory. The price is relatively affordable too!

Authentic italian thin crust pizza and pasta at Greenwood Ave. Good food, reasonable prices. Great for family meals and the place is child-friendly! They have another outlet at Binjai Park

Pizzas here are average but this appetizer is da bombbbbbbb. fat cheesy pillows wrapped in layers of divine fatty pork - def. my version of a low carb meal. a bit salty really, but who cares!!!
Thin crust with the right crunch. Tasty and flavorful. Try the pancetta ! The half cooked egg really brings a different taste &amp; texture to the pizza. It\'s about $20 per person. Totally worth it.

Their \'Carne di Maiale Ragu\' is thick, creamy and was soooo good at satisfying the pasta cravings that I\'ve been having (but don\'t expect the smell or taste of truffle even though they mention truffle cream). Binjai Park\'s version isn\'t as thick as Greenwood which is good since Greenwood\'s was slightly too heavy. Still, it\'s best for sharing among a few friends in case the sauce is too rich for you!\n<br />---------\n<br />Peperoni Pizzeria\n<br />Address: 7 Binjai Park, 589821\n<br />Food: 12inch Bacon Miele (24+), Carne di Maiale Ragu (32+), Bruschetta (9+)\n<br />Don\'t forget to use the 1 for 1 offer if you have the Entertainer!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #dinner #binjai #peperonipizzeria #pasta #richcreamygoodness #cravings #satisfied #burpple #burpplesg #1for1 #entertainer #value
This is my favourite pizza to order because of the honey drizzled on it!! The contrast between the honey\'s sweetness and the bacon\'s saltiness hits all the right notes with the fresh oregano cutting through all that richness. I promise, the combination of flavours will definitely keep you coming back for more ü§§
Love the Parma Ham with Rockets pizza! Not sure when did I start being crazy about parma... üòÖ
Being a huge fan of pasta, I\'ve always been very particular on whether it\'s done al dente. Sometimes a restaurant may get the flavors right, but when it\'s pasta is overcooked, it spoils the entire dish. At other times, they may have gotten the pasta al dente, but the flavours disappointingly fall flat in your mouth. 
You can mix two different flavors of your liking. So we chose #pepperonipizza and #seafoodpizza. And we all left belly full of #pizzas üçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçïüçï\n<br />#FoodReviewsSG #FoodReviewsAsia
