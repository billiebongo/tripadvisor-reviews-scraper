did you know your quintessential western food classic at kopitiam - fish and chips is actually an ‚Äòearly example of culinary fusion‚Äô? so say wikipedia. vis-a-vis technically, we are partaking a gastronomic journey that dates back hundreds of years.\n<br />. \n<br />three times here and still it didn\'t disappoint (consistency checked) - the almost grease free crisp exterior batter that does not feel heavy or stale from repeated oil reveals moist firm succulent flesh. dip into the in-house made rich tartare sauce, paired with addictive fries and revel in joy that this is unbelievably under $10. i may be biased because this is in my hood but missus\' 3 times approval cannot be ignored. and you know what they say.. \"the wife is always right.\" #burpplecheapngood #burpproved

Natural lighting on point, but sadly this special chicken stew ($12.50 nett) not so. Wayyyy too salty for my liking - perhaps my own mismanaged expectations? I expected a hearty stew full of flavour.
This Western stall by night (it\'s a coffeeshop in the day) may only operate after 5pm, but its never-ending stream of customers is testament to how value-for-money the food is here. Regulars of The Carving Board know that its best to come as early as 5pm to snag a seat. Expect everything \"western\" you can think of ‚Äî pasta, burgers, grilled meats and ribeye steaks, all reasonably priced below $20. The customisable Spaghetti (from $5) is what you should come for ‚Äî al dente spaghetti tossed in your desired sauce (tomato, cream, spicy tomato or aglio olio) with choices for add-ons like Grilled Zucchini ($1), Smoked Duck ($3.50) and Seafood ($3.50). For heartier mains, the saucy Barbecue Pork Chop ($9) that comes with a side of salad greens and sauteed potatoes will fill you up just right. \n<br />Avg price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Emily S
very decent tasting burger ($11) at the @thecarvingboardsg and doesn\'t break the bank! while fries could be better and patty was juussttttt tad harder than i preferred, this place still defo warrant a second visit (especially the carborana, looks pretty dope). missus\' fish and chips in the background ($9) was equally promising if not a surprise cause we totally heart the crisp batter. so here\'s to an imaginary one fine day plan at yuhua - fei fei noodles in the morning, zai soon for lunch then carving board for dinner. woo hoo.. eat, song, die, you.
Who says the west is boring? Hippie cafe + Kopitiam Location. Not sure if it\'s worth 1.5hrs of Q. Had better meat at Astons. One of those - once but not again (Unless no queue). It\'s just okay only in my opinion. 
the pork chop is tender and flavourful, and the curry mayo fries were good too, with spices and tomato, it doesn\'t get boring even till the endÔºÅ
Prawn Aglio Olio ($9.50 nett) 
Queue very long even at 5+PM! Come early, y\'all!
Salmon Pesto Spaghetti ($10)
Norwegian Salmon &amp; Couscous ($14) - I rarely order fish when I eat out; this was my partner\'s &amp; boy was I jealous! The salmon was moist &amp; seriously tender. The skin was slightly crispy. The bed of couscous it came on complimented it perfectly. I really recommend this!
Mixed Grill ($17) = Chicken Chop, Sausage, Beef Steak.
Kronenbourg 1664 on tap; $10 a pint. It\'s Wednesday &amp; I need it.
For just $8!!  And it comes with garlic bread and poached egg. Sauce wasn\'t overly creamy and they were quite generous with the serving (it was just nice). But the queue was rather crazy. If I\'m not wrong it opens at 5plus and there was alr a queue. We went down to queue at 730pm and we had to wait 30-45 mins in the queue which was a bit crazy since it was in a Kopitiam setting hence, it was rather hot. But overall the food was really good and affordable! üëçüèº thumbs up for them
Curry Mayo was on point! Even though the portion was a little disappointing, the savory sauce and crispy rings made up for the lack in quantity. Quality side at only $4.50.
The pork chop was tender and juicy despite being grilled on the outside. Their barbeque sauce tasted a tad different from normal bbq sauce but provided a more smoky taste that went really well with the pork chop. Price: $9
The fish was juicy and savoury despite being grilled and the sourness of the sauce below the salmon complemented the freshness of the salmon steak really well and it only costs $15.
The patty was a little too pink in the middle for my liking. Maybe it is to retain the tenderness and juiciness of the patty. Loved the combination of pineapple but the curry mayo tasted ordinary and failed to impress. Maybe they can marinate the pork with curry powder to increase the taste. Price was reasonable at $9.50. There also have the truffle infused fries at $5.50 which we were too full to try. If only they had allowed us to top-up the difference for upgrade. 
Served at a new western stall which takes over the entire food court in the evening which also serves beers along with bar bites named The Carving Board. One of the mains available from the grill would be this Barbecued Pork Chop; tenderly grilled and juicy with light hints of pepper in the marination. BBQ sauce seems to be house-made; tasted pretty near a brown sauce with black pepper than the usual Hickory-style. While the Pork Chop were decent the sides were a bit off; the caramalised onions with potatoes came with a tinge of sweetness with thinly sliced potato slices which was decent but better when warmed (although it also reminded me of a similar cai png side), while the garden salad had a rather sharp sour dressing that was not to my liking.
One of the items on the beer bites menu of a western stall that takes over the entire coffeeshop at night named The Carving Board. Nothing could go wrong with these rings; fried till golden-brown and crisp with every bite. Unlike the others I usually have, there is no empty gap in between the fried batter and the calamari, and there is no rubbery texture for the calamari either. Curry Mayo feels like a tamed version of the one that they use for their Currywurst; tasted of a more premium McDonald\'s Curry dip with an egginess from the mayo to it.
finally tried @thecarvingboardsg and definitely will be back!
Ribeye Steak [$25], Cajun Fries [$4], Pesto Salmon [$12] 
Olive Oil Basil Pesto, Parmesan, Zucchini, Grilled Norwegian Salmon „Äã$12
One of my favourite places to drink beer. There is a separate queue for drinks (vs food) so you don\'t have to wait forever for your drinks. 
Lamb Shank and Ribeye Steak is delicious and highly recommended to try the food out however it\'s abit pricey.
