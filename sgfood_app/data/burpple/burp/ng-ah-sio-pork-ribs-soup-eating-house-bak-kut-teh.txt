Light dinner 😆😜 before durian dessert at Balestier. Pork Ribs Soup, without rice, very strong white pepper soup base, quite spicy. The pork is fall off the bone tender, one of the best in Singapore! 
finally tried the famous ng ah sio bak kut teh!!! tender pork ribs w free flow yummy broth, what\'s not to love?!! 😋 it\'s mildly peppery (not crazy peppery like my favourite song fa bkt lol) but i really appreciate the stronger dose of herbs and garlic in this one. #burpple
A hint of pepper in this pork soup. Worth a try!
1. Pork ribs, 2. Liver, 3. Small intestines and a pot of Tirguanyin (Chinese Tea)! Slurps!!! Awesome way to end the weekends! 😋 
Before hipster brunches became all the rage, my idea of a luxurious brunch came in the form of Ng Ah Sio BKT. This place has a long history in my family. My grandpa used to bring the family here and in turn, my dad brought our family here as we grew up. It was over here at Ng Ah Sio where I learnt a lot about my grandpa, who suffered a serious stroke many years back and as a result, none of us grandchildren really knew much about him. Grandpa is a really traditional person, who placed strong emphasis on conserving traditions. One of which would be the serving of the Chinese tea. My dad would always demonstrate the elaborate procedure, from cleaning the pots in hot water to rinsing of the tea leaves and finally serving the tea from the most to least senior, as he narrated how grandpa used to do it for the family. Aside from the little nuggets of family history my dad shared at the table, the one reason I keep coming back is definitely for the quality of the food. I absolutely loved the delicious pork rib soup- all peppery and flavourful as well as the preserved vegetables, which was not too salty. Pig intestines and taupok&amp; taugua taste pretty normal, but I\'d always add those to my meal out of pure habit. After being taken over by the Jumbo Group, Ng Ah Sio now had a few outlets all over Singapore. But I\'d always come back to this main branch at Rangoon Road, for the food, for the nostalgic feel and for all the family memories shared here. #hawkerpedia
It\'s braised pork knuckles were incredibly delicious and well cooked! It was one of the most tender ones I ever ate! Side dishes aside, it\'s pork ribs were huge and cooked to with the right amount of heat that it was not hard to chew on! Finally, the soup was worth drinking but nothing really special about it. It\'s the favorite Bak kut teh stall of taiwan president Ma though! 
Teo chew super pepperish BKT. I liked the vegetables though and the meat, tender and super good with the dark sweet soya sauce and chili 😀
Oh so pepper-ish bak Kut teh, it\'s not bad. But, the dishes were just, MEH 
hard to choose the champ between founder and ng ah sio. i go with founder if i have to. but the sides dishes frm ng ah sio were really outstanding that night though. p.s: the clash of era were so evident - historic long ng ah sio on one side and a modern outfit, wood shed on the other. jus saying.
What is more therapeutic than warm pork rib soup with tender pig trotter and tea? 😋
I found the soup too be too spicy for me... too much pepper...
Mixed spare and pork ribs $7.50. Not cheap, but really good.
Ho Jiak! 👍 bak gu soup is good but meat abit tough.. Duck is awesome!! Tummy warmmy!
131102: Happy Deepavali\'s Day to all my Indian friends.  // Perfect November on a first Saturday with family. Finally craving satisifed. This restaurant was recommended by a CEO of a chef from HongKong. Price was reasonable and good tasting. // #BakgGutTeh #Breakfast #pryeeat
Peppery soup style. Meat is tender and flavoursome. In the background is kidney and liver soup. Good thing that the organs r cleaned very well with no offal (pun intended) smell.
Truly for the rainy day. Pipping hot peppery soup is definitely a morale booster. This is slightly too peppery for my comfort :)
Not nice. Meat too hard. The cleaner behave as if people owe her money. We already very polite to her already still kick table kick chair, clean table also show black face. Knn! Well, maybe she\'s the boss who knows? Will never eat here again. 
impromptu lunch with colleagues! the soup is awesome :-)
Having the super peppery for a cold wet night. :-) would you like some too?

However, i was disappointed that the soup was too peppery.. Pig intestines to the rescue! Well braised, smooth and tender.
The broth is a combination of both the herbal and peppery flavour. The peppery flavour is extremely stimulating and it is arguably the most poignant bak kut teh I have ever savoured. If you are a fan of really strong and intense flavours, this is the place to come.

$$ well spent
Fatty goodness
But the soup is too peppery for me. Strepsils to the rescue!
Peppery soup base. But not too spicy.
Meat too dry for my liking.
It\'s good!!! 
Bak Kut Teh set for lunch 😝😻🍲🍴🍚
This pork rib soup is not as peppery as most other places and is especially famous with Hong Kongers
This is so good !
