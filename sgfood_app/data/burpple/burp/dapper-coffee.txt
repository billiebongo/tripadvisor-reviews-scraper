Got our hands on some mystical Unicorn Tears at the Christmas fair at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. Lol... and in the new limited time pink bottle too! Preeeeetty! 😍😍 Shake it up!
[New Menu] Who knew I would love Middle Eastern food until I\'ve recently tried two rendition of the shasuka, one by The Botanist and the other here at Dapper.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I prefer this for the sharper spice and muted acidity in the tomato, resulting in a creamier spiced tomato confit. Instead of fanciful chorizo iberico and bacon used at Batonist, Dapper sliced and mixed in pork sausages for that necessary savoury kick. That creamy, savoury, spicy, or in short - lovely paste kept me busy dipping my soft Turkish toast in it before topping them with the sausages.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This concludes the 3 part cafehop with @veronicaphua over lunch last week! Till we explore food places again!
What stood out for me in this pan of Sausage Shakshuka was the sauce. It veered away from the usual tomato-dominant flavour profile that you get at most places serving this. What\'s also good is they served four pieces of bread alongside - perfect for mopping up every bit of the sauce.
Back at one of my fave cafes with Wendy this time 😊
••\n<br />Both Unicorn Tears and Gold Brew are $10 each, with sparkles and shimmer in it (so pretty!). Unicorn Tears are basically have a citric taste with a little fizz  while Gold Brew taste like a very diluted black coffee.
Had a taste of unicorn tears -- Apparently they sparkle 💙✨🦄\n<br />-\n<br />Tried this oh-so-instagramable drink from @dappercoffee the other day. As expected from a sparkling blue drink -- tasted as unique as it sounds [no alcohol, no caffeine] 👌 #shaketosparkle\n<br />-\n<br />🍹 Unicorn Tears [of joy -- they say 🤗]\n<br />💰 S$10.00/bottle\n<br />🏠 @Dappercoffee\n<br />📍 73A Amoy Street, 2nd floor\n<br />🕔 Mon-Fri / 8am-5pm [closed on weekends, too bad -- i know]
Loved everything in the poke don - yummy &amp; generously portioned marinated tuna &amp; avocado, except the squid ink rice felt really undercooked.
Out of the menu I\'ve only tried this and everytime I\'m back, I\'ll skim the menu telling myself I\'ll order something different. But in the end, back to this that doesn\'t disappoint.\n<br />#DapperCoffee
Earlier today, I had the pleasure of bumping into Daniel, a barista who used to work at Maison Ikkoku, and is now at Dapper Coffee. It\'s been a very long time since he made me a cuppa, and I thought it was kind of him to treat me to this signature drink (thanks again Daniel! 🤗)\n<br />The \"Earl Grey Yuan-Yang\" ($8++) revealed itself to be deeply aromatic, which shouldn\'t surprise given that it\'s a concoction of single ristretto, bergamot oil-infused milk and lavender. It had the kind of thoughtful details I like as well: a single extra-large cube of ice and tiny purple petals to prettify. Nicely done, Dapper Coffee!
Wonderful scrambled eggs (it was originally boiled eggs) with a whole load of greens on the side! Pity they\'re only open on weekdays, otherwise this will be an ideal weekend hangout spot.
Probably better known for their unique cakes and quirky drinks - they do a very decent breakfast too! Had this sinfully yummy Croissant Waffles, crisp &amp; flaky; a perfect combination with the toppings - talk about starting the week right! 😎
Not beating rookery\'s for sure, but these are some really decent scrambled eggs!
So looking at the menu you have your standard options; i.e. quite heavy Mac and Cheese which I decided to have. My partner opted out for a clean menu option - a salad with medium boiled eggs. Hints of sliced almond, sprouts and avocado finished up the meal and with no dressing (except maybe a hint of olive oil) it still had a very well round flavour. He added bacon for an extra $2 which, to me personally and my constant cravings for oil, finished the dish to a level I knew I could eat daily. Pricing was between $15-$20 off the top of my head (he actually discounted us after I asked to take a picture of his shirt) and very much worth it.
Like Dapper Coffee (which isn\'t open on the weekends).\n<br />Formula to get work done:\n<br />⋅ good coffee\n<br />⋅ R&amp;B/Hip-Hop music (the old school stuff)\n<br />⋅ coffee\n<br />⋅ dim lighting\n<br />⋅ coffee\n<br />⋅ fast wifi\n<br />⋅ coffee\n<br />⋅ power plugs\n<br />⋅ coffee\n<br />⋅ optional pokemon stop\n<br />⋅ coffee\n<br />#WorkHardAnywhere #CoffeeAddict #DapperCoffee
Fluffy earl grey chiffon, with cream that is refreshingly light &amp; salted egg yolk sauce - combination works surprisingly well together!
Apart from their sparkly drinks, Unicorn Tears and Gold Brew ($10 each), Dapper Coffee also serves uniquely flavoured cakes baked by Project Atrios that may raise eyebrows, but in a good way. Head straight for the cake counter, where you\'d find their best-selling Salted Egg Black Sesame Cake (from $40 for a three-inch cake) with its distinct canary yellow salted egg sauce drizzled over the cake. It looks too rich to consume, but the black sesame flavour is light, and balances out the more intense salted egg sauce beautifully. If you want your birthday girl to feel extra extra special, contact Liz Yap, the baker, for a customised cake. Be sure to throw in all her favourite flavours together in the cake — like how our Burpple Tastemaker Vanessa Kou did for her truly unforgettable Chocolate Honey Banana Coconut Cake!\n<br />*Whole cakes have to be ordered two days in advance via Dapper Coffee\'s website\n<br />Photo by Burppler Kayla Cys
Regardless of race, language or religion, we are still one United Singapore. Here\'s an example of an East meets West creation, the Salted Egg Yolk Earl Grey Cake ($9), that truly exemplifies our identity. We may be a rojak community, but that\'s what we should be proud of as when the different cultures blend together, we work as a cohesive unit.
Dapper Coffee sure knows how to make things pruuu-reetehhh! ✨
The salted egg yolk craze is still on &amp; this glorious rich yellow cake is definitely one for the fans! An interesting combination of salted egg &amp; black sesame that surprisingly goes well. Don\'t be afraid by that seemingly thick yellow glaze! It\'s not as salty &amp; heavy as it looks. The salted egg yolk crumble on the top help add on a good crunch! 🍳💛💛 
Embellished with pretty tea flowers, this customised cake is literally all my favourite things put together.
Birthdays are the best reason to eat cake.
Loving my customised @ProjectAtrios Chocolate Honey Banana Coconut Cake! It is all my favourite things put together.
Gold Brew &amp; Unicorn Tears ($10 ea)
Seriously the coolest drink I\'ve ever seen! Shake to sparkle, and you\'ll observe swirls of glittery magic swimming in this bottle drink. The taste is kind of like sweet lemonade, a perfect combination of sweet and sour. Downside is that it\'s $10 for a small bottle. 
I think this cafe is getting a bit too popular. 😩 My little work space is not so quiet any more. 😞 Luckily the nice loud 90\'s R&amp;B + hip-hop music makes up for the human intrusions.\n<br />#WorkHardAnywhere #DapperCoffee #EarlGreyYuanYang
So a \"mind-blown moment\" occurred when I took my first bite of this light sponge cake saturated in the intense flavours of passionfruit and orange. I swear the supremely light cream threatened to float off at any moment if it wasn\'t for me pinning it down with my fork 😜
$10 for a bottle. Extremely hefty price for something that is considered so small and little. Personally, I feel that this drink is overhyped. While there was indeed swirling in the drink, there wasn\'t much of a swirl. It tasted very much like sprite that does not have any gas, with a hint of lemon in it. I feel that they could have packaged the drink in such a manner to make it more costly for people. Would not consider it an entirely nice drink even though it was light and sweet, I would suggest for you to try it only once if you would like to see how it tastes like and why it is so expensive!
$10 for a bottle. Extremely hefty price for something that is considered so small and little. Personally, I feel that this drink is overhyped. While there was indeed swirling in the drink, there wasn\'t much of a swirl. It tasted very bitter and the coffee taste and smell was very strong. I felt that they could have packaged and worded the drink in such a manner to make it more costly for people. Would not consider it an entirely nice drink even though the coffee taste was distinct, leaving a lingering taste in your mouth, I would suggest for you to try it only once if you would like to experience for yourself and also find out why it is so expensive!
•\n<br />what I fucking hate are places who don\'t serve ice water. da fug
I knew I have to try this to unravel one of the greatest mystery on earth. Lo and behold, unicorn\'s tears taste just like lime juice 😂 Paid $10 for this **** !
No unicorns harmed in the process. Definitely. Drinking this won\'t give you immortality but you\'ll perhaps find it an interesting drink. Tasted a little sour, probably composed of citrus fruits and other magical ingredients. Give it a try, you might find yourself loving this for months to come. Also, give it a shake or a stir in your glass and stare at the shimmering blue potion. It reminded me of stars and galaxies. Mesmerizing! { $10 &amp; 7.5/10 }
An interesting mix of earl grey infused milk and coffee sprinkled with lavender on top. Im a huge fan of both earl grey and coffee and this drink captured both loves into one drink. Dayum! Personally, i found the taste rather unique and I\'m sure fans of either Earl Grey and or Coffee will find this an interesting drink. At least try this once! Love it, hate it, its still an experience. { $6++  &amp; 8/10. }
The salted egg flavour was rich and fragrant, together with layers of light black sesame chiffon and black sesame frosting, topped with salted egg yolk custard and salted egg crumble. With a balance flavour of salty and sweet, it was an interesting eat. But for 9 bucks a slice, maybe not for the second time. 🍰
The premium deal bought from the Sugar app got me a plate of fluffy scrambled eggs, bacon jam and toast with free-flow coffee for just $12. Tucked away on the second floor of a shophouse along Amoy street, this place is a hidden gem I could see myself going to for their good coffee. Wifi and power plugs are the other reasons why too 😂 The sitting area isn\'t big considering that the cafe is rather small but cosy. They also had an interesting selection of cakes like Salted Egg Black Sesame cake and Gula Melaka Walnut Oat cake which I\'ll be sure to try the next time round ☺️

Dapper Coffee has WiFi, power plugs and rock solid coffee — three good omens for those who work remotely. Like Burpple Tastemaker Eleanor Tay, we come back for the Earl Grey Yuan Yang ($8) — espresso, earl grey tea, bergamot-infused milk and hints of lavender. It\'s the kind of chilled drink that leaves you feeling refreshed after just one sip! Do note that Dapper Coffee is only open on weekdays. 
Chillin\' with yet another glass of Earl Grey Yuan-Yang. The cafe only opens on weekdays, so check it out if you get to work offsite.\n<br />#DapperCoffee *
salted egg yolk sesame cake (6\" $50) •
Dapper Coffee\'s morning cafe staff  demonstrate exemplary service by actually taking instruction over the phone from their bar staff at 10am on how to make my cocktail, which they did so with aplomb. Nicely executed with just the right hint of orange bitters and sugar, and an aromatic crisp candied orange slice to boot.
A serviceable greasy fry up of sausage, bacon, shaved beef and scrambled eggs. For when you are hungover or when you need to line your stomach in preparation of some cheeky weekday lunch drinking.
A warm cup of Matcha-chocolate Latte to start the day.
So much left undone. But it\'s a new week… get up and try again…\n<br />For a seriously chill place to work with music, coffee, food, WiFi and power plugs, check out one of my favourite places to work–Dapper Coffee.\n<br />“It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.” —Seneca\n<br />#WorkHardAnywhere #DapperCoffee *
You can never have too much furikake, and Dapper Coffee\'s vegetarian pasta proves it. Topped with runny egg, this dish packs a kick in its nori-cashew pesto. A must try whether you\'re a pasta lover. 
Still liking this modern twist on yuan-yang using Earl Grey tea and hints of Lavender for a chilled aromatic caffeine boost.\n<br />There\'s something about the light, shadows and music that makes Dapper Coffee one of my favourite places to blitz through pomodoros.\n<br />#WorkHardAnywhere #DapperCoffee
Ft. Popcorn Caramel Chocolate Fudge Cake
LOL (Can turn on volume.) This is a Salted Egg Black Sesame Cake ($9), supposedly sponge cake like texture, a layer of salted egg cream in the centre and salted egg crumble at the top.
Head on down to @dappercoffee for your salted egg cakes fix! They are now serving them PERMANENTLY in their cafe!
If you need a little balance in your caffeinated routine, try out this Earl Grey Yuan-Yang at Dapper Coffee. With Bergamont milk and hints of Lavender, this cold concoction goes down smoothly and is instantly refreshing.
The pleasant surprise and extreme cuteness of this mini doughnut was a little perk in my gloomy mood. Look at the teeny meringue kisses! 😍 The doughnut was the perfect size for Ele too. 😅\n<br />And just FYI, the toasted marshmallow doesn\'t come with the drink. It\'s there because… I\'m greedy and a spoilt brat.\n<br />The Yuan-Yang (Earl Grey, Espresso, Bergamont Milk and Lavender) was actually really nice. A lighter, refreshing change from pure espresso coffee with hints of lavender with each sip. The lavender scent was pretty nice to my stuffy nose too (I\'m surprised I can still smell at all).\n<br />Dapper still remains one of my favourite places to #WorkHardAnywhere with super fast WiFi, great drinks, power plugs and good music.\n<br />#DapperCoffee #CoffeeAndCravings
I love salted egg, but was never a fan of sesame. Feeling a bit like trying new stuff, I ordered it and it wasn\'t bad! It was actually quite dense but still quite dry. The taste of the sesame wasn\'t overpowering (phew). Also, see that special blue sparkling magical potion? That\'s Unicorn Tears. If only it tasted as magical as it looks.
Dapper Coffee rocks a rustic vibe untouched by pedestrian food trends. The Poke Bowl, which consists of squid ink rice topped with tuna and avocado, is pretty decent, though the main draw are the quirkily named drinks (Unicorn Tears, anyone?) and cakes which change regularly. 
The matcha flavour was thankfully not too overwhelming, cake a little bit dry, and um, not worth the price (which I didn\'t know till I paid...)\n<br />.\n<br />Anywayyy, back to doing the things I like! Yay to exploring streets and discovering new places again, feel so liberated and happy to be out and about hahaha.\n<br />.\n<br />(P/S: more frequent posts over the next few days - you have been warned.)
This orange chiffon sponge cake was soaked in orange whiskey, covered with chocolate ganache, with dripping sticky caramel sauce at the side of the cake, lastly sprinkled with orange salt. It\'s not overly sweet and moist with a hint of whiskey that follows on the heels of the chocolate flavour. Would you like to have a slice too to start your day? 😁😁😁
Or maybe last week. 😂 Riding the waves in life and having heaps of things to do… things I did this morning seem like it was last week… last week seems like last month. 😂 But wouldn\'t have it any other way I guess. Keep occupied and distracted from burdens, sadness and things I can\'t have. 😕 Random midnight rants on a sugar high…\n<br />⋅\n<br />#DapperCoffee #Coffee #Cake #Dessert #TeaTime
Still not as good as the Earl Grey Salted Egg Yolk cake at @dappercoffee that I haven\'t seen in some time.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#DapperCoffee #Dessert #Cake
The butter cream was stiff and one-dimensional; salted egg \'sauce\' hardened like fondant and tasted nothing like it should; the cereal topping was soggy and tasteless (really why is it even there?); and the most basic yellow cake was dry, dense, tough, and inedible. I can\'t understand why these salted egg cakes are considered \"hot sellers\". Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but still. No excuse for a cake as awful as that.
Dapper coffee is not exactly dapper but a pretty cool place to chill (can\'t wait to try their cakes / drinks!) Aglio olio wasn\'t really al dante, wasn\'t very spicy nor garlicky, but I liked how it tasted with the furikake and wasabi sprouts. And of course the eggggggg. A little overcooked but ok la. $16.90.
It doesn\'t show well here, but the pretty drink SHIMMERS. Didn\'t think it would taste any magical, but it\'s so pretty I couldn\'t resist it! It\'s basically a really diluted fruit punch; so order only cause of its aesthetics and don\'t expect much of taste.
Moist, and really lovely with a tart punch that makes you just wanna go on and on. (Go early if you\'d like to have the salted egg black sesame cake as it was sold out when we were there in the late afternoon.)
Note to self: We should always add nori to aglio olio in future 👌  #umamibomb #pastalavistababy
From the not-so-secret Dapper Coffee\'s unicorn menu, I bring you the magical Unicorn Tears! With its beauty I was kind of embarrassed to order it... I whispered \'unicorn tears\' softly and more audibly \'the blue sparkly drink\' to the friendly staff as I don\'t often say those two words together. But I wanted to cry tears of joy when the glittery drink was served in a small bottle, like a magical blue potion. The pretty swirls created were mesmerising so we proceeded to shake the bottle for a couple of minutes before finally pouring it into the glass and stir it endlessly for the swirls. Looking good and fun to drink, the fruity concoction tasted sweet and a little tangy.
More dense than expected, the cake\'s texture does remind me of a Black Sesame chiffon cake but the salted egg custard between the layers made it really unique and distinct. I love the fragrance from the two elements and the added crunch from the salted egg crumbles on the sesame cream at the top!
Throwback to the day @misstamchiak, @camemberu &amp; I grabbed a quick cuppa after lunch at Park Bench Deli. #yummy #burpple #foodiesg
It\'s magic! Let me introduce one of Dapper Coffee\'s signature drinks, Drinkable Jelly [lemon-mint jelly with suspended flowers] and it comes with violet-blue syrup that turns the drink to a lovely shade of red. The prettiest drink I have ever laid eyes on (and so fun to drink)!!!! It is slightly sour and sweet, really refreshing. The perfect drink for a lazy afternoon~
I was like \"WOW\" when I walked into the place because it\'s hidden in the 2nd level of a shophouse with a really cosy setting. A coffee place in the morning and when 5pm comes, they turn into a drinking place!🎉\n<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖\n<br />In the photo, we have the Mango Avocado Cake &amp; their new cold brew which is golden in colour!😮 Be totally amaze by what this place has in store in you because I was pretty amazed!😁 Thanks @karlnch for introducing the place &amp; always nice catching up fellow foodies friends over a(I should say many😂) nice cup of drink!😌\n<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
Newly launched of \"Gold Brew\" made of unicorn\'s tears 😁😁😁! Visually appealing and a good cold brew on a crazily hot weather!
Not sure if its the fact that I am turning 21 this year, but a lot of my tastebuds are changing. I have NEVER liked anything salted egg, much less in a cake. 
Sugarcane sponge cake covered with lemon zest cream, topped with honeycombs, dehydrated lemons and sugar cane drizzle. Can\'t really taste the sugarcane in it but it was still good! Thank you for making this cute mini version sugarcane cake for us! 😊😊😊
We were all mesmerised by the beautiful swirls that the coffee has! Launching soon at Dapper Coffee!
This is a black sesame sponge cake that reminds me of a chiffon cake, layered with salted egg custard in it, covered with black sesame cream, lastly topped with salted egg crumbles and dripping salted egg yolk sauce at the side of the cake. Sadly I couldn\'t taste the flavor of the black sesame but the taste of the salted egg this time is more distinctive as compared to the earl grey salted egg cake I had the other time and I\'m loving the salted egg crumbles that give a crunch texture to it. Thank you @monkeey_lizzzyap and @christineseah once again for keeping the last slice for us! Great to see you guys again! 😊😊😊
Head on down to check out all their delicious and unique bakes in limited quantities everyday!
Everything salted egg seems to be the trend for 2015! We got our hands on this slice of Salted Egg Black Sesame Cake at Dapper Coffee. Pretty ulu and quiet at the 2nd floor of Amoy Street though.
And it was... MORE TIRING THAN RUNNING. Oh well.. This is the only thing I can do for now.
How can a drink look this good?! Lemon mint jelly with suspended flowers from @dappercoffee Tastes as good as it looks! Drink comes unsweetened with a violet colored syrup that turns the drink red as you pour it. \n<br />Great dramatic lighting in this magical place dressed in copper and absolutely beautiful doors (see earlier pictures). #burpple #dappercoffee
Yes you heard me! The talented @monkeey_lizzzyap of @project.atrios came up with this salted egg york earl grey cake a week ago - spiced vanilla sponge cake layered with salted egg custard in it, covered with earl grey cream, lastly topped with s\'mores and dripping salted egg yolk sauce at the side of the cake. It has a soft fluffy, spongy texture that reminds me of a chiffon cake and it was not overly sweet. It had a slight salted egg taste in it which I love it but personally would love it to be a lil stronger. Perhaps next time can serve together with some salted egg york sauce at the side for me to drizzle with? Hehe!
- this strawberry matcha cake. I did not manage to try it this time round but will certainly be back for it! All their cakes look this awesome!
Look at that yolk dripping down the sides…
Super fast WiFi at this Cafe. Try the salted egg yolk Earl Grey cake!
Just the right amount of spiciness with delicious nori-cashew pesto, furikake, soft boiled egg and wasabi sprouts. The egg was a little overcooked this time around, but I’d definitely have this Japanese inspired pasta again.
Probably one of the prettiest cake ever! (Check out those glorious golden yellow cream dripping over the surface). Taste wise it reminded me strongly of the salted egg York taste in mooncakes. 
And yes that\'s a claypot with mac and cheese and in an attempt to eat healthy...a salmon avo furikake rice burger 🍲🐟🥑🍚🍔🍰

Definitely the best cure for any Monday blues!
Mmm.
Just when my mouth was itching something sweet..... There was a special delivery ❤️❤️❤️ salted egg yolk earl grey chiffon cake!
Break the egg, let the runny yolk flows over the al dente spaghetti and it works beautifully to tie the ingredients together in this super tasty vegetarian dish! Pretty satisfying!
😪 Anyway, have a great Sunday folks！
Happy TGIF! Any plan for this evening? If not, check out my latest blog review on the Spiffy Dapper at Amoy St before making your decision.
