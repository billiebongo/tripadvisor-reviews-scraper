Big, fresh and sweet. \n<br />Love our Sunday breakfasts.
Pork Rib Prawn Noodle
Add some chilli flakes for an extra heat, what would be better if they have an adult version with some XO for a punch.
She loved every bit of it.
This week has been full of my noodle moments. But I am just glad to share oodles and oodles of noodles stories.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />At first when this bowl of prawn noodle was brought to me, it looked so ordinary. But I always believed and applied the same principle as first time meeting someone... never judge a book by its cover or never judge a person by the look. So here I go, tossing, twirling and messing it up so that the sauces do its make up job. There is a very old school taste. Chilli had a nice invigorating heat that tantalised my tastebuds. White chor bee hoon and yellow noodle entangled together playfully with beansprouts for that crunchy texture. Prawns danced exuding umaminess and pork ribs flexing its firm and tender flesh. Broth had a sweetish prawn and bak kut (pork rib) mouthfeel.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />My \"Friyay\" noodlelicious moment right here #inmyhood
50 years of dishing out their specially guarded broth to the community. Although pretty common for prawn noodles to be priced $8 and above, I find the price steep for the portion I get. Miserable few slices of lean pork, miniature too. About 5 mid size peeled halves prawns, shallots and lard makes a $8 bowl. I must admit the broth here is good but little compared elsewhere. Existence and survival hood of this stall could well be from die hard fans as you can easily get similar or even better broth with much generous servings elsewhere. Yumminess: 3.5/5

Here\'s a portrait of my anonymous friend slurping up her MEE-Hoon and kway teow version of the Prawn Noodles. With multiple side orders of offals - liver &amp; intestines. | #meemyselfandisg #food #noodles #instaweekend #joochiat @aikbengchia
Jumping on board @aikbengchia\'s Instagram project to celebrate the glory of local noodle dishes. Here\'s a self-portrait of me and my Prawn and Pork Ribs noodles. I like my order with mee pok instead of regular yellow noodles, tossed dry with spicy and prawn sambal and ketchup with a side of ribs swimming in fragrant broth | #meemyselfandisg #food #noodles #lunch #instaweekend #joochiat
