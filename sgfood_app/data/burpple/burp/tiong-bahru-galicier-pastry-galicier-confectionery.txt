Tea Break in local style with old school kuehs \n<br />Kueh Salat 糯米加椰糕 ($1.10), Kueh Ambon (honeycomb cake) ($1.30), Lemper Ayam (chicken) 鸡肉糯米卷 ($1.30), Lemper Udang (Sambal Shrimp) 蓝花糯米虾卷 ($1.30), Coconut Tart ($0.90), Kueh Dar-Dar (White Coconut Roll) 白椰子卷 ($0.80), Putu Ayu ($3.80/ 5 pieces)
Dreaming of Galicier Confectionary’s bestselling Nonya kueh, Kueh Dar Dar (白椰子卷)... I just want to take a bite out of the soft pandan crepe that conceals the crunchy white grated coconut fillings. At 80 cents per piece, the white coconut roll is not too sweet with a moist and fragrant interior. Great by itself and better with a cup of morning coffee or milo!
Spicy wicy dreams of this moist and spot on spicy treat. Om-nom. #foodporn #galicierconfectionery #burpple
Instead of boring old chocolates, I got nonya kuehs for my colleagues to share for Christmas.
The warmth of home-made traditional delicacies here is greatly evident in every single sweet and cake you buy. My personal favourite will be their ondeh-ondeh, a chewy ball with gula melaka filling, covered in shredded coconut. Pop the ball into your mouth and feel the explosion of sweetness from gula melaka right away, without being too jelat. I somehow love the ratio of gula melaka to the dough here as compared to many places that offer an overwhelming amount of gula melaka which irritates my throat in the end. Their items range from traditional coconut candies, kueh kosui to slightly-more-modern carrot cake. So this is another hidden gem that I\'ve been introduced to recently: a lovely old-school confectionery.
or maybe because am lesser a sweet tooth these days. no matter, still the best kueh dadar i dare say, in singapore.
Actually I did it yesterday but I encountered some issues, so I JUST got it solved! Still feeling a little apprehensive, but that\'s just me being a worrywart. High in Neuroticism, they say. Hahaha!
Incredible ondeh ondeh and kueh dada. Moist soft chewy kueh with explosive sweet amazing gula melaka. Kueh is life. 
There\'s a reason why my best friend\'s sister religiously spends approximately $40 each time she visits Galicier to stock up Kueh for her (big in numbers) family! Definitely one of the best kuehs around competing with the top spot begawan solo takes in my family\'s hearts!                                                                               For us, good Kuehs are packed with authentic flavors and of right textures and all the kuehs we tried (including the colorful Kueh lapis not in picture) were so!                                                            The ondeh ondeh was interesting with the use of sweet potato and sesame seeds in the gula Melaka, however my family still prefers the bengawan solo pandan ondeh ondeh without sesame seeds because we are stubbornly conventional 🙊 Having said that I foresee boxes of Kuehs for takeaway every time we visit the Tiong Bahru area in the future (-: 
$0.60/piece, and I think this is one of the nicest ondeh ondeh I\'ve eaten. This tiny ball of goodness had soft chewy skin made from sweet potato, with really tasty Gula Melaka (nope it didn\'t explode when we ate, but be careful when you eat, wouldn\'t wanna lose any of the oozing awesomeness!!) and surprise surprise they actually included sesame seed into it, enhancing its fragrance. Regret buying only one to try😂
$1.30, first time eating this soft and spongey honeycomb cake and I absolutely loved it. 
Kueh Ambon is just one Kueh I cannot resist; usually the first thing that I will scout for in any stall that sells Kuehs. The one from Galicier had a citrusy taste on top of the sweetness and soft as the fork sinks into the streaky holes within.
Melt in the mouth pandan colored crepes stuffed with natural white colored grated coconut instead of the usual brown colored 
Prices of the cakes and kuehs are not as cheap as you would most probably expect.
Happy Mother\'s Day to all mums!
The place to have your kueh quick fix. The only bad thing about them- they sell out pretty fast. By mid afternoon almost everything is gone!
Topped with fried onion and sesame, this taste good with a little chilli. Chinese pumpkin cake is worth a try !
Light, fluffy and airy mango cake. A good end to a meal. Really delightful treat! 
The rest of the Kueh kueh I bought earlier on! A good way to end the weekend!
Siapa suka makan Lemper Udang? Ini sungguh enak sekali! Makan satu tak cukup lah! #sgmemory
Who has a soft spot for Kueh Ambon? (Honeycomb cake) Mum used to make it when we were kids.  #sgmemory
Kueh Dadar. Will such heritage food disappear one day? #sgmemory
I must admit never eaten this before! Do u know what it is?

Sweet Retro moment! @ Galicier Pastry 😽\n<br />*****\n<br />Such a heritage eat at this old school bakery place nestling just next door to Tiong Bahru Bakery. At 11:30 am we steadily make our way into this hectic stall. Luckily we know what we want to try as the place is tiny &amp; jam packed with a lot of patrons scrambling for orders. 😅\n<br />.\n<br />We proceed to order a variety of kuehs,\n<br />almond cherry tart and Apple pie. 🍮🍪🍰\n<br />* Apple pie $3: Worth every cents. Delicious and very rich chunky apples! 🍎 \n<br />* Putu Ayu ($4 for 5 pcs): this little mix color cup is not so sweet and this is neither our favourite.💁‍♂️\n<br />* Lemper Udang 2 pcs ($1.3 each)(the spicy flavour of dried shrimp is coming through and delicious to eat in room temperature)🦐\n<br />* Kueh Ambon $2 (the yellow honeycomb shaped Kueh is distinctively sweeter than other kuehs &amp; a must try)🧀\n<br />* Kueh Salat $1.1 (no difference than others)💁‍♂️\n<br />* Almond cherry tart $1.4 (surprisingly good with full bite of cherry 🍒)\n<br />We noticed quite a few price jump in some kueh items but can always vouch for apple pie, almond cherry tart and cookies which are reasonably priced &amp; won\'t disappoint! 🤑 \n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />📍Galicier Pastry\n<br />Blk 55, Tiong Bahru Road, #01-39, S160055\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#kuehs #heritageeat #localeats #snack #confectionary #dessert #sgsnack #sgdessert #sweettooth #foodie #foodblogger #kugelkaffee

A marble cake, a pineapple tart and a lemper udang (glutinous rice with spicy shrimp). #oldschool #jiaklocal #bakeries #burpple #hungrygowhere #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgfollowers #bloggersg #bloggers #foodspotting #instafollowers #instafoodsg #discoversg #tripadvisor #visitsingapore #foodiesg #thebestfoodphotography
Kueh dadar, kueh kosui, and kueh salat. Loved all three, wanna try all the kueh they have! The kueh kosui from Sunway Niche (Wisma Atria) is softer and hence better in my opinion though! The kueh salat\'s glutinous rice layer was perfect, but I think the pandan layer can be better cos I liked Benggawan Solo\'s rendition more (just for the pandan layer). Best out of all three is the kueh dadar. This eggy crepe filled with fresh coconut was so yummy.
Count me in!!! 😘
This is lemper udang...sambal haebee in steamed glutinous rice. So good i can eat like 4 or more pieces. Yumz😋 #lemper #glutinousrice #yesteryears #hungrygowhere #i8mondays #8dayseat #8daysmagazine #opensnap #burpple #sgfoodies #bloggersg #igers #traditional #igsg #instafollow #instafood #cafesg

Both taste awesome!
\"Its so fluffy I\'m gonna die!\" As one animated character would squeal. These pretty Indonesian steamed coconut cupcake are so fresh that they were steaming up the transparent cases they were sold in. Airy texture, delicate pandan aromas and nutty flavour from palm sugar makes this a glorious win. I could just pop dozens of these Putu Ayu at a go. | #putuayu #food #foodpic #foodporn #streetfood #kueh #vscocam #vscofood #foodvsco
Ol\' skool kueh dadar, sweet coconut stuffed pandan-flavoured pancake rolls are best served during tea time but the rebel in me is having them for breakfast. They are also known as Kueh Ketayap back home in Malaysia. And these pillowy version are so dope they might as well be called kueh dadah (\"drugs\" in Malay). | #food #foodpic #foodporn #streetfood #nonya #peranakan #kueh #vscocam #vscofood #foodvsco
Going to have these for snack after dinner. #igsg #kueh #sgfood #instagood #instafood #instasg #foodporn #sweet #snack #foodhub #foodgasm
Things I like about Tiong Bahru, No.9: Where heritage stores selling authentic old skool kuehs can thrive along  spanking new F&amp;B concepts which are quickly taking over the neighbourhood. Who do you think will outlast each other? | #food #bakery #sgig #tiongbahru
Odeh Odeh. #burrple. Melts in your mouth
Custard cream puff! S$0.80
