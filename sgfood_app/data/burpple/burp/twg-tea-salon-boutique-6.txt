4.5 munchies: Encased in a frozen meringue topped with fresh berries and raspberry coulis is the Vanilla Bourbon Tea ice cream and Sakura! Sakura! Tea sorbet (on the other side). I loved the brilliant combination of South African red tea with sweet vanilla and sour sorbet made from the fragrant blend of cherry blossoms and green tea. The Sakura Vacherin is an apt dessert for sharing with your date/significant other in this season, too!
Scrambled Eggs in Truffle Oil, Smoked Salmon and mixed Salad with prawns plus London Breakfast Tea to start a perfect day 😌 Taste and presentation deserves a 🔟
It was alright. Nothing really to shout about. Tea took a back seat with most of flavors. \n<br />It felt more like an afterthought. Like let\'s make apple flavor ice cream! Let\'s just pour abit of this tea so that its uniquely TWG. \n<br />Monster will give it one more try and cast his final vote. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Sweltering day calls for cooling stuffs! Whilst waiting for my bestfriend\'s arrival to start our Dreamworks Exhibition, chanced upon this! It was perfect for the hot weather we\'re currently having in Singapore right now. It wasn\'t too sweet nor was it too strong of a taste. Heard that their creme brûlée tea is good, shall try drinking it the next time!
Order the vanilla and earl grey chocolate flavours. They are two of the best so far.
This tea set is delicious, if you want something light for your afternoon tea. Choice of 3 macaroons, 2 scones or muffins and a mini sandwich, plus a choice of tea, is such a bargain for the quality that TWG has to offer.
Excellently prepared, this light crepe filled with gruyere cheese, ham and potatoes. this dish fills you mouth up with such rich flavours that you\'d definitely come back to try the rest of the savoury crepe menu.
Must try : earl grey chocolate! 1 scoop for $5, 2 scoops for $9, 3 scoops for $13! 
Hahaha! Yes this is name of this tart. Bestseller in TWG. The crust for this tart is really good! Very buttery! The filling is very much like creme brûlée with raspberries. Very interesting.
TWG rose macaron is the best macaron in town. Very strong rise taste :)
They only have brunch sets in the morning,  meaning you\'re forced to eat more than you intended for $40-50+ . A la carte only starts at 11.30 am.  Doesn\'t make much sense to me but oh well.
Chocolate fudge, Caribbean crepe with an added scoop of vanilla bourbon tea ice cream, breakfast/English Earl Grey and Japan\'s Sencha. A great place to have tea but I always feel out of place cause it\'s too Atas feel 😂😂😂 spent a total of $60.60
Sampling TWG\'s newest collection of Iced Teas with toothsome macarons and other saccharine delights. 
What a gorgeous cake! 🍰 Monday is almost over; hang in there 😇
I swear that they have the best macaroons in town! What\'s even better is that besides not being alcohol infused, it\'s tea infused with variety of tea flavours. Despite the sweetness coming from the filling, you can still taste the hint of teas!
Twg chocolate earl grey has officially become my favourite tea. #foodporn #hightea #twg
Post dinner drinks. My friend ordered the sexy tea for me... I didn\'t felt any sexier afterwards
Go for this if you are in the mood for something light. The chicken was a little hard for my taste but the greens were delicious.
This Napoleon Tea ice-cream is my new favorite flavor! Think black tea with caramelized macadamia nuts! Mad loveeee 😋😍☺
Delicate flaky pastry filled with stewed apples served with a scoop of homemade Singapore Breakfast Tea ice cream and topped with an unctuous caramel coulis infused with Pomme Prestige Tea
seared salmon with french beans, carrots and potatoes. love it coz the salmon was still juicy. very flavorful
the combinatuon between the foie gras and the apple and the choco vinaigrette is perfect
Wellness is the key to Happiness... Spent a lovely Saturday siping tea in TWG and this teapot had to capture my imagination.
Not working on a weekday afternoon is quite shiok
Had some #twg #tea with @visualchef. I must say the tea was awesome! Slurps!
Lobsters were so succulent that I wished there were more
Rare Yin Zhen white tea with sweet jasmine 》$5/Scoop
Ok, that\'s all.
This is Group Exec. Chef David Thien\'s wonderfully executed Beef Tenderloin with Nargila tea-infused Foie Gras &amp; Comté Cheese Pudding. #MediaInvite
Both are refreshingly good for a sunny weather!😋💕 If only @twgteaofficial\'s Ion outlet serves ice creams too.. #burpple
Very ordinary, small portions.
