And I\'m one of them.\n<br />Here I am, eating 4Fingers for the first time.\n<br />#food #foodphotography #foodstagram #fastfood #4fingers #supper #burpple
Why must everything I like be so expensive.
Love how crispy the battery remain despite being douse in flavoursome garlic soy and hot sauce. The hot sauce was unexpectedly spicy, with heat levels building up upon even bite. \n<br />Kimchi fries failed to impress though. \n<br />#fourfingers #chickenwings #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #whatiate #whati8today #sgigfoodie #eatoutsg #burpple #openricesg #sgeats #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger \n<br />#changiairport #fansofchangi

yum yums...
woooooooo
And so.... What happened to the 5th finger? 😉
I\'m the only person I know who finds 4Fingers overrated. The chicken skin is a wee bit too salty, that\'s why. But the kimchi fries were not bad!
