This time round, ordered the Set Meal for 2 ($15 comprises 2 X Braised Pork Rice, 2 X Bittergourd Pork Rib Soup, a Braised Chinese Cabbage &amp; a Salted Crispy Chicken). The rice is $2.5 as individual order &amp; the soup &amp; cabbage are $3. Added Fried Intestine ($4) too &amp; that one is really good. Very fulfilling lunch indeed! \n<br />_ \n<br />Pic taken @Eat3Bowls\n<br />Seah Im Food Centre\n<br />Stall # 01-21\n<br />2 Seah Im Road\n<br />Singapore 099114\n<br />Operating Hours: Tentatively 10am - 7pm or until sold out\n<br />Closed: Sunday\n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eat3bowls/\n<br />_

Intestine Mee Sua ($3.50)\n<br />.\n<br />@eat3bowls seems to have gained some popularity in the recent months and it is not hard to understand why. This Intestine Mee Sua is well-priced and tasted like it came right out of Ah Zhong Mian Xian‚Äôs kitchen in Taipei. The portion size was also decent with many diners opting to order a bowl of their braised pork rice as well. Thick gravy coats the mee sua and the braised intestine bits were like flavour bursts in the the mouth. I only wished for some chilli sauce to spice things up a little. Go early to avoid the lunchtime queues!\n<br />.\n<br />üç¥\n<br />. \n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #BurppleMajulahMakan #sgfoodie #foodphotography #sgfoodlover #fooddiary #foodstagram #foodieat #sgfoodlover #foodie #foodlover #igfood #foodporn #asianfood #hawkerfood#sghawker #eat3bowls #intestine #offals #mienxian #meesua #braisedintestines #SeahImFoodCentre
Fried Intestine ($4)\n<br />.\n<br />Another of my fave @eat3bowls is this huge portion or lightly battered tasty pig intestines fried on order. The thin crispy crunchy exterior with the soft chewy intestine so well braised and flavoured makes this a must order accompaniment to the mee sua for true-blue offal-lovers! So good to the last piece there‚Äôs hardly any overly greasy aftertaste that lingers.\n<br />.\n<br />üç¥\n<br />. \n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #BurppleMajulahMakan #sgfoodie #foodphotography #sgfoodlover #fooddiary #foodstagram #foodieat #sgfoodlover #foodie #foodlover #igfood #foodporn #asianfood #hawkerfood#sghawker #eat3bowls #intestine #offals #fried #friedfood #braisedintestines #SeahImFoodCentre
I braved the heat and went for it. So yummy! ($3.50) I asked if I can add $$$ for more intestine? They said YES! so I added $1.00 üòÄ .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Seah Im Food Centre üçúüçúüçú #intestinemeesua #innards #sghawkerfood #hawkerfood #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #burpple #stfoodtrending #instafoodsg #taiwanesefood #streetfood #whati8today
The best braised meat rice in sg that is almost taiwanese standard :). Pork belly used instead of normal dry and cranky minced meat. The bittergourd pork rib soup also good. Pork ribs tender. #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgmusttry #seahimfoodcentre #eat3bowls #sgfoodie #sgbraisedporkrice #burpple

Though I still think the one at 5 bears taste better, this one is a cheaper and nubbad alternative!! The pork here is slightly sweeter, but the portion is still quite generous! Haven\'t found a ÁõêÈÖ•È∏° that is very nice though! \n<br />#exploresingapore #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #burpplesg #burpple #sgfood #sgig #sgeats #sgfoodie #seahim #luroufan #taiwanesefood
Cannot be compared to the ones in tw but at least it\'s close. #seahimfoodcentre #Âè∞ÊπæÂ∞èÂêÉ #Âç§ËÇâÈ•≠ #sgfoodcentre #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #8dayseat #whati8today #burpple #openricesg #epochtimesfood #iweeklyfood #foodphotography #foodstagram #uncagestreetfood
I had the Êª∑ËÇâÈ•≠ set (braised pork on rice) for lunch today. This stall is set up less than 1 week ago in Seah Imm food centre (facing the bus interchange), and focuses on Taiwan eats. The vegetable dish is nice! I would have liked that the braised pork had a stronger taste but $7.50 for 3 dishes is way worth this quality. Owners shared that they used to operate in pasar malams only, but had many customer feedback that it\'ll be great to have seats. So that\'s how they ended up with a spot in Seah Imm. :)
