Small at $7.90 and large at $12.90.\n<br />Not bad. Pretty satisfying. Try the matcha latte too!
lean and green is the name of the game here. lots of greens from avocado and green salad. At $14.90, meal is priced alright but its definitely on the light side. 
Haakon (pronounced as \'haw-coon\') is a Norwegian-style cafe in the new Raffles Holland V building (just across from Holland Village MRT Station) that serves healthy eats all day. Swing by with your fitspo colleagues during lunch service for the Vegan Bowl ($9.90). It comes with quinoa, hummus, sundried tomatoes and avocado â€” all nutritious and delicious. Looking for a midday snack? Get Haakon\'s Classic Acai Bowl (from $7.90), which comes with a base of chia seeds and granola, topped with plenty of blueberries, coconut flakes and bananas. It\'s rich in antioxidants and a great energy booster! Haakon is also a nice light-filled place to hang while sipping on a Breakfast Smoothie ($5.90 for medium, $6.90 for large), thanks to the high bar seats and big windows that face the street.\n<br />Avg price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Alison Ho
Oh my gosh! Can\'t tell you how happy I am to have discovered this place! I finally have a serving size big enough to satisfy my piggy cravings for Acai! Truly an amazing find in holland v and I definitely would recommend this place for some healthy breakfast, brunch or dessert! Sorry project Acai but don\'t think I\'ll be visiting anytime soon with Haakon around!
Slightly more icey and not so smooth as normal smoothie bowls imo but I am really obsessed with their amazing granola and coconutty Chia pudding!
Smoked salmon, egg, chicken and lots of healthy stuff. A good place to go to get healthy protein.
Healthy can be yummy too. Check out this new Heathy food joint at the new complex in Holland village 
overpriced and nothing special

Classic acai smoothie bowls for $7.90 (medium). The large ones cost $12.90. A tad expensive, but worth the price.
Can\'t wait to return :)
Another great place to go for Acai lovers
