I know A Noodle Story has been around since Beauty &amp; The Beast, but I finally managed to catch \'em on a day where I only (!) waited slightly over fifteen minutes for this medium sized bowl of their signature noodles, priced at $9.
What a gem hidden at the back row of Amoy Street FC. Also known as Singapore style ramen, this bowl of noodles definitely does not feel like it should be priced at $7. In fact the ingredients used and preparation are very close to a restaurant-like ramen. 
Finally made it to A Noodle Story and was first in line when they reopened for the evening (come at 5:30pm, no queue!).
A Noodle Story Ë∂ÖÂ•ΩÈù¢ at Amoy Stüçú\n<br />- Cha-shuüçñ\n<br />- Hot Spring Eggüç≥\n<br />- Crispy Potato Wrapped Prawnüç§\n<br />- HK-Style Wonton
Char Siew, HK-style Wanton, potato-wrapped prawn, oozing Onsen egg and yummy noodles. So what if they increased the price a little? This was still value-for-money what you\'d get in the bowl.
The owners take pride in their work and there\'s lots of stuff for everyone. From the onsen egg, shrimp wanton to the homemade charsiew!\n<br />-\n<br />At $7 a bowl this is definitely a steal! Monster loves this Atas wanton noodles!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #noodlestory
Finally decided to trek down to Amoy Street Food Centre to try the legendary Singapore Style Ramen from A Noodle Story. I have to say that this is a very well thought out bowl of noodles. For me, the highlights were definitely the charsiew and crispy potato wrapped prawn. The onsen egg was also perfectly executed with an awesome runny yolk‚Äîcan see why this place earned a Michelin bib gourmand.

The hong-kong wanton and the potato wrapped prawn was definitely the highlight. The potato and the prawn compliment each other, giving a crunchy texture while the prawn gives a tad sweetness. ¬†\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Instead of using the traditional ramen noodles, Mee Kia was used thus giving a springy texture which totally surprised me! Now I know why A Noodles story received¬†¬†Bib Gourmand in 2016. I just wished the opening hours could be longer as I was missed out!
üí∞: $5 (Small) ‚Ä¢ $7 (Big)\n<br />üïö: Reached at 11.15am ‚Ä¢ Queued for about 15min\n<br />üöá: Tanjong Pagar MRT Station ‚Ä¢ 5min walk\n<br />üìç: Level 1
$9 - got the big bowl (as usual).
Prices have increased to $7 and $9 respectively since the last time i visited but the taste is still so good. Truly deserving of the Bib Gourmand Award.
not sure if people are calling this \'singaporean ramen\' but i don\'t agree with the term. i feel that it is just a well cooked bowl of noodles with well thought-out ingredients. why the need to compare it to ramen!\n<br />particularly enjoyed the char siew - there was a good ratio of meat to fat. however, the egg was slightly too runny on the inside. for the quality of the food, i guess $7-9 is fair for a bowl, though i\'m sure people will disagree. \n<br />did the queue also get longer after they got their bib gourmand? i can\'t imagine office workers queuing a good 30 minutes just to eat this on a regular basis.
A Noodle Story at Amoy keeps up with its standard. The queue is Long, but they patiently prepare bowl by bowl. \n<br />This is superbly tasty Mee kia piled with braised char siew, Hong Kong-style wontons, a crispy potato-wrapped prawn, spring onion and an onsen egg ($7-$9). For once, I thought it didn\'t even need the chilli. Was good enough on its own. #DFDHawker #dfdnoodles #DFDMichelin
Hearsay they queued for half an hour for this $5.90 bowl of gorgeous \'charsiew wanton mee\'. The melt-in-the-mouth charsiew, crispy potato wrapped prawn, soft-boiled Japanese eggs and prawn wanton were so pleasing to the palette! Would have been even better if they didnt add so much oil...
..a bowl of awesome noodle for lunch
The pride taken to execute this dish is evident - noodles are tossed in the sauce to ensure that the flavour is balanced, the melt-in-your-mouth cha shu is bathed in a sweet/savory gravy and every item is placed precisely for the Instagram-worthy photo op. Be prepared to queue 30mins for this, but if you\'ve never tried it before, it\'s definitely worth the wait! #burpple #hawkerfood #hawkerpedia
Queuing for a good half hour and perhaps slightly more, I am a bit torn over the value of this bowl of traditional¬†noodles¬†cooked in¬†an¬†innovative way. Named in Michelin Guide‚Äôs Bib Gourmand list, the Singapore-style Ramen is definitely uncommon with the¬†elements of both Japanese Ramen and traditional Wanton Mee.
A cross btw your traditional wan ton mee and Japanese ramen. They really take pride in their presentation so expect a longer waiting time amidst the already long queue. The noodles were springy like hk style noodles and it is seasoned in their special sauce consisting of lemongrass, garlic and oil. Their homemade Sambal Blachan though not so spicy was a good contribution to the entire umami experience. Of coz it was the half cooked egg that got me salivating. Instead of char Siew, you get a substitute of Japanese pork belly that is marinated n cooked for 36 hours in a water bath resulting in a very tender pork that melts in your mouth. Only thing I didn\'t really like was the fried prawn curled thing which didn\'t really go and was so oily. Other than that price was reasonable at $5.90 for a small bowl.
I queued 1hr 30mins for this noodle. I was rally hungry, my legs were aching and My expectations was sky high.. It is a good bowl of noodle. Every single element of the dish was well done. The egg, noodle , Prawn right down to the soup. It was all prepare to perfection. But for 1hr 30mins wait.. nahhh .. there a alot of good food in Amoy that has way shorter waiting time.
It\'s just heaven on a bowl! Sinful but once a week sinful treat is acceptable! HK style wonton mee topped with super good sauce topped with crunchy prawn potato fritters, wontons and egg that just popped on the first bite. No char siew here, came too late. But queue early to get a complete bowl. Did I mention it\'s only $5.90! 
First \"Fishball Story\" and now we have a \"Noodle Story\"! This elevated version of wanton mee surprised me rather pleasantly. The wantons were very juicy and filled with thick, fresh prawns. The golden potato prawn fritter was done just nice as well. The char siew was very tender and soft (I think my own grandma could eat it easily on her own) and nicely slicedI thought that the ramen noodles could be a little \"q\" though. Sadly, it\'s now 5.90. While it is delicious, I don\'t think I would pay 5.90 for it again. 
Modern hawker fare at Amoy. Al dente wanton noodles topped w fried prawn and siew yoke. Go early to beat the queue! 
Definitely better than japanese style. Medium size ($7.20) u will get one full onsen egg,  3 wanton and 4 slice of meat. Simply love it. -M
Started a food blog in an attempt to create a personal reference list to overcome my indecisiveness on where to eat next. Follow me if you want, links in the profile ‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />A noodle story\'s bowl ($6.50)  features a deep fried potato wrapped shrimp which reminded me of the sugarcane shrimp you get in Vietnamese cuisine, the meltingly tender sous vide cha siew and marinated eggs with a yolk that angrily gushes out when you pop its egg white dam which you get in Japanese ramen, followed by the tightly wrapped wantons and thin springy noodles you find any decent Hong Kong cha chaan teng all tossed in a gingery sambal sauce typical of Singapore‚Äôs cuisine (7/10)
A good deal at $6.50 for a medium bowl. The chashu meat was so tender, and the hot spring egg was so soft, bouncy and yummy!! Will definitely be back for more!! :p
.\n<br />The only one of its kind created by two young hawkerpreneur is an innovative spin-off from the usual wanton wee.\n<br />.\n<br />Incorporating ingredients like wanton, braised char siew, onsen egg, potato prawn, fresh scallions and their own concoction of sauce, the synergy between these ingredients has formed another unique experience worthy enough to claim as our own local rendition of ramen.
I was craving with this \'Singapore Style Hawker Ramen\'. Queue was long and my stomach was keep calling but i wasn\'t care because no matter what my mind only thought of the ramen, the sauce, and the potato prawn roll
Handmade noodles that were chewy and springy to bite on. Flavorful piquant sauce that goes well with the noodle. Generous with their portion of ingredients with their potato prawn and sauna egg being my favorites! 
This is the place i am to recommend. Normally we eat is japanese ramen. why not try our local style ramen instead. This Creative idea came frm the brainchild of a chef who were trained at Shatec working a couple of experiences in the restaurant before started their ramen business. The Chef Decided to open their creative ramen at Hawker Centre.Their Ramen consist of Hot Spring Egg, Potato Wrapped Prawn , HK Wonton , \n<br />Springy Egg Noodles. A Bowl of Savoury Pork Rib Soup is served with the Noodles. Come Try &amp; Savour it\n<br />Name:Ë∂ÖÂ•ΩÈ∫µ A Noodle Story\n<br />Address: 7 Maxwell Road #01-39 Amoy Street Food Centre \n<br />Singapore 069111\n<br />Operating Hours:\n<br />1100-1430 Weekdays\n<br />1730-1930 Weekdays\n<br />1030-1400 Saturdays\n<br />Closed on Sundays &amp; Public Holidays
Dubbed Singapore-style Ramen, these young hawkers serve up something closer to Wanton Mee. Though Amoy\'s not short of cheap &amp; good fare, ANS justifies its premium price with novel, competently-executed components.
$5.50 for a delicious bowl of noodles. What more can I ask for? The egg looked delicious but lacked flavour sadly. :( Love the soup too! 
I would say sophisticated wanton noodle that don\'t cost a bomb! They come in 3 size $5.5/$6.5/$7.5. $5.5 is more than enough for a glutton lady -M
Perhaps the last Singaporean to actually try this for the first time; so lucky to still find them open during the evening! Noodles carries a good bite and were rather springy, while the sauce carried a nice hint of savoury flavours and was really shiok when tossed in the moderately spicy Sambal that comes as an option. The sides were a smart option; going for a slight Japanese feel, it comes with a molten egg with slurpy yolk and sous vide charsiew that was tender and soft as well as a deep-fried potato-wrapped prawn for some crunchiness. Servings of wanton is also generous, given the fresh full-sized prawn that is wrapped within. It\'s not going to be very mind-blowing, but this is still highly recommended; it\'s the effort placed in this bowl of noodles by the Gen-Y hawkers with the emphasis on quality that makes this so different from the usual.
I loved most is their cha-su that is cooked sous vide for 36 hours and it is super soft and tender! Easily satisfied with this bowl of goodness and is worth checking this stall out if you are around the area!
Travel around Asia in a bowl of noodles - HK style dumplings, Vietnam inspired potato wrapped prawn, Japanese style char shiu and onsen egg and Singapore noodles. Noodle strands are a tad clumpy but the toppings are delicious and the product of the pair\'s culinary innovation. 
Everything about this bowl of noodles was great, except the noodles. Would have been nicer if they used a more la-mian sort of noodle rather than this wonton mee kind! Especially enjoyed the potato prawn fritter which on first bite felt like potato chips üòç The dumplings were also of quality, with legit pieces of prawns. Overall worth a try but not quite worth queuing for during lunch peak hour; the queue seriously crawls.
Best way to end my first day at work omg thinking in terms of wanton mee (instead of the Singapore ramen that they brand themselves to be), this is pretty awesome. The charsiew took me by surprise - so tasty and tender; and you could actually taste the prawns in the wanton. Crispy potato-wrapped prawn were alright. The onsen egg yolk disappeared when I wanted to eat it though. Noodles were not as springy as I\'d have liked but I don\'t really mind. Soup was not bad too! (Don\'t eat spicy stuff but the chili was goooood. But probably not spicy enough for others) Could be because I\'m hungry, but I felt a little sad when I finished it. Not exactly cheap at $5.50 but ok la I\'ll be back at dinner time where there\'s no queue üòÅ
Average soggy wanton noodles topped with average wanton pieces, charsiew, onsen egg and a potato wrapped prawn. Way overhyped but then again for $5.50 I guess you cannot complain üòê #eatoutsg #8dayseat #burpple #instafoodsg
Despite being famous and always having a long queue for its unique singapore style ramen, I personally think it\'s overhyped. Everything was just.. decent. Nothing much to compliment about üòê\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Finally had my Singapore-style ramen after Amoy food centre reopened. I think it\'s a fantastic localized spin on the Japanese ramen and it\'s encouraging to have young hawkers around! We should really support young hawkers in Singapore for our local hawker culture to thrive! The ramen egg was soft and oozy like lava, the potato prawn was so crispy and char Siew was really tenderüçúüç≥üç§
With young and innovative hawkerpreneurs like Gwern, our local food culture looks set to evolve. However, it is equally important that we support them in their efforts to add vibrancy to Singapore\'s food scene
Love the eggs, seriously. If I can buy all the eggs, I would. The prawn is interesting as well. Love the fried noodle around it. My must-have when I drop by Amoy. 
A couple of talented Singaporeans decided that ramen can be served at hawker prices, $5.50-7.50 (you get more wontons the more you pay), and created this delightful version. Think springy wonton noodles coated in a garlic, ginger, onion-infused oil, beautifully meaty wontons, irresistibly oozy onsen egg, slices of tender melt-in-your-mouth chashu, and shrimp wrapped in strings of crispy potato. Phew. At half the price of normal ramen, it certainly doesn\'t compromise on flavour or satisfaction!
They call this Singapore-style ramen. I call it perfection in a bowl.
It\'s always refreshing to see fusion food because it\'s not easy trying to marry two different flavors while standing out as a unique dish. a noodle story gives a Japanese twist to local wanton noodle and executes it quite well. Love the gooey flavored egg and chashu. It would have been better if they\'ve chosen ramen noodles instead for this dish but overall a good attempt to jazz up hawker food. 
The much raved noodles from Amoy food centre that has been getting a lot of reviews. Finally had the chance to eat it even thou I\'m working at tanjong pagar for 2 years onwards now. That explains the queue during lunch time! Much love for the egg &amp; the wanton! üòç 
And boy oh boy, I loved its presentation, springiness of the noodles, sauce, Chilli, fresh dumplings.... Actually everything.
Closed since November last year due to renovation works at Amoy Street Food Centre, A Noodle Story has opened its shutters once again, churning out what has become a hawker favourite in the CBD ‚Äî Singapore-style ramen. It features springy wanton noodles coated in a garlic-ginger-onion infused oil, wantons, irresistibly oozy onsen egg, slices of tender melt-in-your-mouth chashu, and shrimp wrapped in crispy potato. Phew. At half the price of normal ramen ($5 for small, $6 for medium), it certainly doesn\'t compromise on flavour or satisfaction!
Have been dying to try this since I heard about it. Finally was in CBD area on a weekday afternoon! Wanton mee noodles topped with wanton, potato wrapped shrimp,ramen egg and fatty pork... I usually don\'t like fried shallots, but they did it pretty well. The wanton mee is al dente, wanton has a whole fresh prawn, potato wrapped shrimp was crispy, ramen egg was sweet and fatty pork was tasty! Even the soup is good, instead of just normal minced pork, it was like a braised pork soup. üëç
what a gem in de cbd where good and cheap food is hard to come by. it\'s only 5.50 and it fills you up while leaving a smile on ur face.  that is how food should be.
found this little stall amongst amoy. taking wonton mee to a whole new level. really flavourful, and even having a ramen styled egg. üòçüòç
A couple of talented Singaporeans decided that ramen can be served at hawker prices, $5/6/7, and created this delightful version. Think springy wanton noodles coated in a garlic, ginger, onion infused oil, wantons, soy-flavoured hot spring egg, slices of melt-in-your-mouth chashu, and shrimp wrapped in crispy potato. This creative dish certainly is half the price, but easily as satisfying. Of course, don\'t expect this to replace your usual ramen!
Springy, al-dente wanton noodles are coated in a ginger, lemongrass, garlic and onion infused oil, with heaps of umami punch provided by konbu and prawn, then topped with chilli strands and a lot of scallion. 2 slices of wonderfully melt in your mouth japanese style pork belly, oozy onsen egg, wantons and a crispy potato wrapped shrimp accompany the good enough to eat on its own noodles. Shiok! $5
I never queue more than 20 mins for hawker food, but I just did for this Singapore Ramen during the crazy peak lunch hour at Amoy market. \n<br />It is actually my second time #ieatshiok ramen and today I upsized it to $6/- bowl. \n<br />Participating in the Instagram Food Photography Contest run from Dr Leslie Tay @ieatishootipost with Theme: Shiok and Hashtag: ieatshiok \n<br />Here\'s my first post of the day.
Showcasing super springy noodles tossed in a special aromatic dressing accompanied with Hong Kong-style wontons, soy-flavoured hot spring egg, meltingly-tender cha-su and a crispy potato-wrapped prawn. Beautifully garnished with freshly sliced scallions and red pepper.
Interesting dish, a must try if one likes to have a mix of Japanese + Chinese food
A really creative &amp; tasty bowl of ramen! At a reasonable price of $5! Super worth it :D
Late lunch! Around the area so came here to try the noodles! Yes is special but I find the sauce a bit too sweet for me... At $5, comes with a crispy potato wrapped prawn, 2 Hk style dumplings, 3 slices of tender Cha su and half a hot spring egg!

All the ingredients are super on point üíØ‚úî(Yes, even the side soup is damn legit) Only thing is the noodles are drenched with way too much sauce which makes it really salty üòÖ #burpple
Yes......this is my noodle story.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Once upon a day, me, myself and I, bright eyed and cheery, traipsed to Amoy sussing out the ever popular ramen. Arrived 5 minutes before opening, a short short queue had already formed. A relatively short wait before it was my turn. I ordered a medium bowl which had three wantons, an onsen egg, charsiew and the wanton wrapped prawn. Seasonings were spot on. A nice spicy kick from the chilli. Melty charsiew. A bowl that embraced the salty, spicy, tender and crunchy textures. Just a teeny weeny comment ... the noodles were alittle clumped together. But still I emptied my bowl.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Would I be returning? Probably not so soon. It does not mean it is no good. I will visit again if and when if I have this \"a noodle story\" craving. THE END.
@anoodlestory Will be a good representation on how a \'Singaporean Style Ramen\' will looks like!

I didn\'t know that you have to ask for the ramen version.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />First bite yielded a mouthful of springy fine noodles, followed by delicious wantons (minced pork dumplings).

For $7.20, it offered tasty chashu, shrimp wantons, fried shrimp roll and a whole lava egg. But the star was definitely the Q ramen texture created by the chefs after culinary experiences with European cuisines and had decided to devote to their favourite childhood noodles. \n<br />Did I mention that it\'s located in the food centre at Amoy Street? For the non-CBD people, they do open but only for 3 hours on sat between 1030 to 1330, and be prepared for a queue. Try it and you would agree that this noodle is unlike any other. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #burpproved
