The char siew were not bad but the wantons given were plump and filling!
My parents-in-law recommended me to eat this White Beehoon at this inconspicuous food stall.  Go try it if you are near. Be warned that dinner crowd is a lot more than lunch crowd.\n<br />.\n<br />I love the superb deep-flavoured broth and will always finish every drop of it.  This serving is only $5.  There is the crayfish option for $8 and above which is a good deal imo.  White beehoon should not be that expensive. .\n<br />Give me this white beehoon anytime!  Maybe our next Besties Day Out should be here in the heartland!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #whitebeehoon #beehoon #SGParentBloggers  #instafood #instafoodie #instagood  #sgigfoodies #foodporn #foodaddict #whati8today #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgigers #foodcoma #nomnomnomnom\n<br />#foodshare #instadaily #sgfoodunion #yummy #yumyum #tastyshoutouts #delicious #foodpics #foods\n<br />#hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #openricesg #sgmakandiaries
Comfort food 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The chicken is well-seasoned and comes in a big portion, which complemented the fragrant chicken rice!
What is Bingsu again? 😄\n<br />#burpple
I like the vibes at hawker centre. Just people watch, everyone queuing for their favorite food stalls then sit down to chill, chit chat and makan!
Late Night Supper. Fried Hokkien Mee with Sambal Chilli 🔥
So many choices. So many craving. Yet I can only choose one. Therefore I choose my all time favourite 👆🏻 #food #foodie #foodpic #foodgram #foodporn #instafood #foodsg #burpple #jacqlovestoeat
Cant resist this simple all time fav breakfast!
I always tell them to omit the minced pork and they are so generous with the rest of the ingredients. Soup is flavoursome; fishballs are bouncy and springy. Fishcakes are a bomb. What\'s not to like? Enjoy a great weekend ahead! #food #foodstagram #foodie #foodies #singaporefood #singapore #instafood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #bestfishballnoodlesinsingapore  #delicious #tasty #yum #yummy #foodpics #nomnom #springtomorrow #breakfast #brunch #eat #hungry
Will request for more chilli and vinegar for next visit. Be prepared to wait for at least 30 mins!
Singapore style. 
And when I go to the market..
My perfect version, \'nuff said.
Perfecto~ #ckt #amk #foodporn #foodspotting #sgfoodie #hawkerfood #charkwayteow #yummy #delicious #asianfood #singaporefood #food
