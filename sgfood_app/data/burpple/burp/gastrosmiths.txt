What a perfect way to end our meal here! The stretchy soft camembert on top of grilled toast, with drizzles of rosemary honey. Not excessively sweet, the rosemary honey was really lovely especially when paired with french camembert. This is perfect for breakfast, tea-time or even dessert. I can (and love to) eat this every day!
Brandishing some of the best karaage in town, the admittedly slightly stiff butter roll is packed with the aforementioned crisp, lightly battered morsels of juicy, sake marinated chicken, then topped with nanban-esque tartare sauce and black lumpfish caviar, the latter of which sadly gets lost amidst its more richly flavoured companions.
This was definitely the most pretty-looking dish that day! The butter sandwich buns were stuffed with golden fried tori karaage and topped with black lumpfish caviar, pickled beetroot and moreish tartare sauce. Wish the sandwich buns were fluffier and I thought the caviar didn\'t add much oomph as what I expected it to be. But I quite enjoyed the fried chicken ‚Äî every bite was juicy and tender!
A great burger is more than the sum of its parts, and whilst each component was good in its own right ‚Äì from the nicely grilled quarter pound Angus chuck patty to the red wine onion chutney, smoked American cheese and plush buns, it lacked the wow factor prevalent in other dishes on the menu, and it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on.
Welcome to flavour town ‚Äì juicy quarter pound beef patty glossed in housemade demi-glace and served with truffled egg over a bed of white rice.

Part of Gastrosmiths‚Äô new menu, this plate of juicy beef is well worth the ten bucks! Crusty sear on the outside and moist on the inside, it‚Äôs well complemented by the savory sauce that‚Äôs made from collagen and the roasting juices of the beef. üëÖüí¶üí¶üí¶
Loving their new concept of affordably priced small plates that deliver huge bang for buck.
Beautifully tender and succulent slices of charred pork neck marinated with shokoji and black pepper, served with a deeply flavourful roasted grape sauce that boasts the perfect balance of acidity, sweetness and complexity. One of my old favourites from when this used to be a full-blown main course.
Tender pork neck tagliata with super addictive roasted grape reduction. Take the chunks of grapes with the pork neck slices to get sweet bursts in your mouth along with the smoky meat. So in love with the sauce!
Swathed in unctuous salted herb butter, such was its tenderness that the fish practically melted in one‚Äôs mouth, and nary a morsel was left.
A simple-looking dish that would be a perfect comfort food in a rainy day. The clean-tasting halibut was lightly seasoned with salt and black pepper. The comfort came from the herb butter, spring onions and the dash of lemon juice. The halibut flesh was so soft and effortless to bite.
Charred and crunchy florets of sweet cauliflower basking in the spicy embrace of a  vibrant arrabiata sauce is umami on overdrive, especially so with a liberal dusting of grated cheese and strands of pickled onion.
These small sharing plates had us falling hard for them! New on their menu, the cauliflower came perfectly charred ‚Äì toasty but with a really nice bite to it, great with the spicy, tomatoey arrabiata sauce. üëÖüí¶
Don‚Äôt make the mistake of dismissing this based on its unassuming menu description because this kai lan is killin‚Äô it with a crunchy, beautifully charred finish and a very  special secret ingredient ‚Äì koji salt. Made from a fermented combination of salt and rice koji(rice that‚Äôs been treated with cultivated koji mold), it imparts rich umami, saltiness and a little sweetness to the vegetables that‚Äôll get your tastebuds tingling. The little squares of daikon are a nice touch, adding both striking colour contrast and complementary crunch and sweetness.
Another lovely combination here ‚Äî who would have thought that kai lan and daikon made a good pairing! The soft kai lan alone was already a nice palate cleanser, but the pickled daikon gave the tangy kick to the otherwise one-dimensional vegetable.
When the ting went quack quack quack, you men were ducking. Me? I was too busy eating. Tender roast duck steeped in an Oolong/Angelica root broth till thoroughly marinated, lightly cured and the flavours have been absorbed through and through. Served with yuzu kosho(fermented yuzu and chilli)  and house-pickled scallions, this is incredible value-for-money considering the time and effort that went into it.
Soaked in herbal marinade for 4 days, the cold duck slices came out tender with a tad of spicy kick. Personally, I wasn\'t a fan of duck skin when it\'s not roasted, but the duck was pretty good. Reminded me of a typical cold dish you\'ll get at a Chinese restaurant.
Whet your appetite with imported kimchi, shironegi leek and black konnyaku.
Ever attentive to customer feedback, Gastrosmiths‚Äô refreshed menu sees the introduction of more small plates and vegetarian options, which to me is a most welcome addition to their current stable of sinfully rich dishes.
Ordered medium well and it was soooooo tender and juicy! Definitely going back again for this! Also can‚Äôt wait to try the other dishes and sides available at the cafe üòç
Yummy tea egg coupled with good old oolong fragrance cooled just right. Works well as an appetiser! üòã
It has become my go-to place when I want some nice fusion food near my place. üëç
I think it might be the first time I\'ve actually had Japanese surf clam. Not unlike abalone, it\'s pleasantly chewy and tastes somewhat similar.
I first saw this bowl of Fisherman\'s Mee Sua ($26) on a friend\'s Instagram story and I knew I had to have it. It was sure worth the long wait, before I finally had time to go down to GastroSmiths.
Too many good flavours in a bowl, yet they all compliment each other very well. I\'m not even sure where to start to describe this bowl of Hokubee Ribeye Don ($26). 
ribeye rice bowl was lit! teeming with hokubee beef cuts cooked to a delightful medium rare over furikake rice. break onsen egg to hold everything loosely together. seriously, the lunch sets here are ridiculously value for money.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpplesg #burpple #foodie #foodart #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodcoma #igsg #instafood #ribeye #ribeyedon #foodpornsg #sgfoodie #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #igsgfood #sgfood #singaporefood #sgdining #restaurantsg #sgrestaurants .\n<br />.
It may look like an unappealing beige mess, but each spoonful is a bite of heaven. Made with a secret recipe cheese blend which I absolutely have to learn, the unctuously creamy macaroni exudes the alluring aroma of truffle as steam gently rises from the bowl. Specked with truffle relish, black truffle and truffle salt, this is one for the fungi lovers.
Cutting into the gloriously medium-rare handmade beef patty unleashes a torrent of juices that\'s greedily soaked up by the bed of rice underneath. This and the demi-glace sauce that blankets everything, makes inhaling the entire bowl of flavour soaked carbs wholly impossible to resist. The creamy truffled egg on top merely piles on insult to any notion of a diet you may have had beforehand.
Weekend vibes with Gastrosmith\'s version of the Catalan classic. A thick slice of fluffy bread with a crisp crust is topped with roasted tomatoes, olive oil and a thick fur coat of grated parmesan. Decent but I still prefer the traditional preparation.
Essentially the seaweed-coated and caramel-drenched lovechild from a urgently erotic tryst between a Gymboxx-built French fry and a curvy, flirtatiously coquettish potato chip. 4/5
The kimchi brought its energetically crunchy, comfortingly warm and suitably sour Korean cabbage sass to the donburi yard minus the usual banchan coldness and water bloat, while elsewhere the rice had sufficient sauce to occupy itself and the chicken had the fatty tenderness of a NAPFA-challenged eleven-year-old nerd. 4/5
The bread had the comforting fluff of a poodle, whilst elsewhere the taut Christmas ham and seductively truffle-perfumed, mayonnaise sandwich-esque creamy chopped eggs tingle your inner mouthly linings with their glacially cool touch. 4/5
This was my favourite from the tasting at GastroSmiths (so much good food), and earned everyone\'s thumbs up (if they weren\'t already in our mouths for us to lick off the sticky shoyu caramel glaze). Great vegetarian snack without any of the usual bitterness from the fermented soybean cake, definitely a better choice of protein with more bite than if it were, say, tofu. GastroSmiths is located at the side of HomesToLife on the 3rd floor of i12 Katong, walk too fast and you might miss it!\n<br />:\n<br />More great dishes to be shared soon, thank you @Burpple for the invite and chef Dillon from @GastroSmiths for feeding us! #Burpple
Tucked away within HomesToLife in i12katong, the once gem of Katong has returned with their local fusion dishes. Their menu is full of creativity and I would love to try all of their items. With a limited stomach size, I had to choose. :\'( The kambing soup that I ordered was thick and flavorful with loads of juicy lamb chunks in it. It pairs very well with the French baguette, confusing the lines between local and french dish.
The sticky sweet, slightly crunchy, protein-packed beer snack alternative. Even for non-tempeh lovers, it\'ll be tough to resist this one. Highly addictive!\n<br />You\'ll find that the recently relocated Gastrosmiths has much to offer. Eastsiders, you\'re in luck!
Yum nom nom! @gastrosmiths dished out an amazingly warm and hearty bowl of mee sua with a few new tricks. Their New Fisherman\'s Mee Sua is flavoured with kimchi, laden with gigantic prawns and soft, yet flakey, cod. Capers are liberally sprinkled all over the dish for that tangy punch. Just a wonderful dish that comforts.
Not a fan of the staid and traditional Osmanthus Jelly dessert, but this variant totally crushed it. Think osmanthus honey drizzled over ice cold lychee and lime sorbet cupping osmanthus flowers in their hollowed out centers, lychee petals and a diaphanous lemongrass jelly that\'s both delicate in flavour as well as form.
I\'m an unapologetic fan of truffle oil and these creamy chopped eggs deliver just that in spades. That unmistakeable aroma hits you the moment you sink your teeth into the egg salad laden soft roll. Do share as it is deceivingly small but substantial. This is money AF üî•üíØ
The pungent potency of Italian Gorgonzola smacks you in the face with the funkiness of a seventies motown trio, fortunately tempered somewhat by the dulcet sugary pop melodiousness of black truffled honey and vanilla seed ice cream. Bringing it all together is the steady baseline rock &amp; roll-esque crunch of almond crumble.
Sweet earl grey ice cream and even sweeter candied kabocha(Japanese Pumpkin) marred my enjoyment of otherwise very appealing flavour combinations. Perhaps a more pronounced tea flavour in the ice cream and a pinch of salt in the crushed pistachio and crumble might improve things.
Where Gastrosmiths really shines is in their mains, which boasts an unexpectedly diverse range of cuisines. One would expect such a disparate menu to falter over its own complexity, but it is testament to chef Dillon\'s prowess that every plate put out so far has been nothing short of good, if not excellent.
I couldn\'t ask for more than a wobbly sous vide egg surrounded by superbly seared slices of protein with blushing pink, perfect medium rare centers. The glistening, fatty meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender and the furikake rice beneath it, goddamn tasty from having soaked up the au jus.
Big, fatty, juicy pork chops served with buttery, silky pomme puree and beer-braised sauerkraut a German grandmother would be proud of. Elsewhere, the red wine grape puree played it like the posh cousin of a McDonalds Big Breakfast grape jelly jam. Second time I\'ve had this, and it\'s still a most mellifluous marriage of flavours that reminds one of hearty but simple bierhaus fare.
Tasting almost exactly and just as good as your favourite hawker kambing soup, I don\'t know what goes into the broth, but Gastrosmith\'s secret herb and spice blend is praiseworthy in it\'s powerful aromatics and perfectly balanced proportions.
Free range chicken infused in sake and ginger marinade results in sweet succulent chunks of meat which are then encased in a thin, crisp batter. Dab these in the mustard aioli for a refreshing zing.
An undulating terrain of Swiss cheese capped cremini mushrooms in garlicky herb butter swiftly succumbed to our very hungry bellies.
Crowd pleaser with a toothy bite and bags of umami. The shoyu sesame caramel glaze is sticky sweet, yet salty and works perfectly on the nutty tempeh.
The earl grey ice cream maintains a suitably classy and conservative demeanour and the softly crunchy pumpkin reveals an au naturel sweetness, while elsewhere the crumble and nuts ensure each mouthful brings forth pleasurable toothly amusement. 3.8/5
Dressed with yuzu kosho (a fermented sauce of yuzu peel, hot chilli peppers and salt) and black truffle oil, this dish will bring me back to Gastrosmiths for more. The other dishes have also been elevated while prices have fallen slightly. It\'s the best thing an eastie can ask for.
Waitress was friendly and cheerful making the evening a wonderful one for me and my lady. Mushroom escargot was incredibly delicious. Definitely a must try.
Still as good as before but missing the onsen egg in the previous version.  GastroSmiths has recently reopened at I12 Katong.  Set within a mod furniture store,  the ambience (and the ventilation) is a lot better than the previous place at Tan Quee Lan street (now Ah Bong Italian)
The truffle exercises more flavour than olfactory emphasis, whilst elsewhere the deceptively humble-sized portion of chopped egg is a densely rich, yolky avalanche that will fill you up faster than a storeman-held tilted jerrycan on the edge of a tonner. 3.8/5
Reopened today at i12 Katong within Homes To Life furniture shop, Gastrosmiths finally makes a return to the Katong neighborhood where it first started as The Humble Loaf at Katong Shopping Centre. Replacing the former cafe space that was run by Homes To Life, the new menu features most favorites from their Tan Quee Lan shop space in smaller portions with reduced pricing without GST and service charge ‚Äî the menu differs slightly on weekdays and weekends. A blast to the past would be their Not-So-Humble Eggs ‚Äî the mainstay on the menu ever since their days of being The Humble Loaf; the same ol\' sous vide eggs with Prosciutto Di Parma and onion pickles. Think of this as the modern version of your typical local breakfast eggs; runny yolk meets savoury slices of cured meat which gives it that punchy flavour and subtly sweet caramalised onion slices with a hint of vinegary tang all complimented with freshly-cracked pepper. A very familiar flavour that I had once tasted three years ago for the very first time, and still a good way to switch things up from the usual local breakfast egg.

Spotted this Kueh dish in the menu and went straight for it. Baked fresh in-house with Pandan and Coconut, I like how the Bika Ambon tasted pretty much like we would expect from traditional bakeries and is not as overwhelmingly sweet as other counterparts whilst carrying a more pan-fried texture from the caramalising that gives it a little more bite. The Vanilla ice-cream was also pretty aromatic and gives the Bika Ambon a little more sweetness whilst sitting atop the crumbles. One qualm I had with the Bika Ambon was that it was a little dense and heavy, lacking the honeycomb/streaky texture within which is signature of the Bika Ambon.

One of the dishes that the waitress seemed to be pushing, we found ourselves ordering it after her descriptions of the dish which intrigued us after realizing we could do with ordering one more item. Described as \"House Bread, Secret Cheese Blend, Red Wine Grape Pur√©e\", this feels like a fusion between the usual PB&amp;J sandwich without the PB sandwich, replaced with a grilled cheese sandwich. The house bread is baked in-house, toasted lightly to get that crusty texture while maintaining a little fluff inside ‚Äî pretty light while spread with a thick, creamy cheese spread that is luxuriously smooth and pretty melt-in-the-mouth with fresh pepper cracked atop the cheese to help cut the flavours when it gets a little too cheesy. While the Red Wine Grape Pur√©e sounded a little promising, the flavours resonated to something to fruit jam, providing the toast a little sweetness. Pretty delicious and a little switch up from the usual sandwich for breakfast.

One of their signatures ever since their time at Tan Quee Lan Street, I was glad that I finally got to try out this highly-raved dish. The ribeye beef steak was well-grilled, tender and smoky in general with a pinkish Centre but feels like it was cut against the grain for it felt rather rubbery on certain parts with lots of veiny parts to chew. The rice was also tasty ‚Äî drenched in a sauce but  suitably moist as it comes flavoured with Furikake; undoubtedly umami especially when mixed with the jiggly sous vide egg sitting in the middle.
Marbled steak, 63 degree egg, furikake rice. Somewhat underwhelming, maybe cause of the hype and expectations. Beef was well cooked, medium rare. We were told that oil was injected into it to retain the meat jus and bring out the flavor. Sadly, the whole show was spoiled by the rice, which was bland and didn\'t taste like anything much. 
Ginger flower and red onion salsa, candied garlic and pomme pur√©e. Loved this dish! Moisture of fish was retained, the salsa provided a good tinge of acid to the dish. Mash was creamy &amp; light to hold the components together marrying the flavors of the plate. 
Loved the chunky crabmeat, blended with mustard aioli and green onions, perfectly finished off with the caviar pearls 
Black truffle aioli, sourdough, black truffle relish. Found this a bit too creamy for my liking. Truffle taste is perfectly balanced with the mayo but will prefer the eggs to be in chunkier bits for the bite and texture. 
 A light and refreshing dessert which the crumblies worked amazing with the vanilla infused ice cream. The crumblies are suspectedly the cashew nut/ almond cookies from CNY.
Essentially the mee siam-esque gustatory equivalent of a breathtakingly beautiful and Dior-perfumed blogger who does pilates, eats walnuts and edamame as midday snacks and replies to everything with vapid three word utterances. Notwithstanding, the scallops had a formidable firmness and fatness and the medley was value-wise highly melodious. 3.7/5
Essentially soft slices of smoked salmon soaking lazily in kopitiam-esque soft boiled egg. Elsewhere, the chilli oil would cheekily engage you in a game of Where\'s Wally. 3.7/5
Slippery smooth linguine, a creamy base, earthy mushrooms, cheese shavings, and a soft runny egg to top it all off! This dish is delightful every time and I\'m glad it\'s still available despite a few menu revamps!
Nothing like the thick mushy mee sua that we are all too familiar with, Gastrosmith\'s mee sua is al dente and bathed in a light but spicy broth generously loaded with mussels, clams and scallops. To be honest the spices may taste a little odd at first, but past a few mouthfuls, the flavors would slowly grow on you. 
$15.50. Very yummy, with the crunchy biscuit bits, caramelised banana and vanilla ice cream. Slightly on the pricey side, but definitely enjoyed this. Cake was molten on the inside and paired well with the ice cream. 
$28. Exceeded all expectations. Especially amazing with the luscious 63 degree egg on top of flavorful furikake rice. Beef was generously portioned and satisfyingly meaty and marbled. Definitely order this. 
Beautifully presented, with a 63 degrees egg right smack in the middle. Hokubee beef is supposedly mock Kobe beef. Perfect medium rare, tender and chewy. Thought the abundance of black pepper masked the true taste. The furikake rice was good and packed with umami flavours, inspiring me to go to a Japanese supermarket to get the seasoning for myself. The generous addition of chopped green onions really elevated the dish. Priced at $28++.
Seafood includes squid, prawns, crab meat and bouncy scallops. Well cooked but really meh. The homemade scampi bisque, on the other hand, was wonderful, very flavourful and intense. I was busy devouring the seafood bisque infused Mee Sua because it was just that good! Opted for the spicy one which is quite mild but adds a nice kick to the dish. Priced at $25.50++.
I love this!! The beef steak slices are cooked perfectly, and because they are fatty, they are so juicy! The exterior is slightly blackened because it is charred to give the wonderful crust! The whole bowl came together so well after mixing the sous-vide egg to coat the beef and rice.
Extremely tender lamb shank, the meat comes off so easily from the bone. $28.50 for this huge lamb shank, sauteed cabbage and mushrooms sitting on top of smooth mash potato. The gravy was superb, red wine braised sweet sauce. Thumbs up!!
Came here to try out their beef bowl as recommended by Burpple Guide, and this dish truly did not disappoint! Love love the medium rare char grilled hokubee beef and runny egg on top of japanese furikake rice. Reminds me so much of the beef in Japan! 
Love the fact that they used mee Sua instead of pasta, as the mee Sua takes in the seafood bisque in very well without being soggy, so that each mouthful is a burst of flavor and texture. The dish truly tastes as good as it looks, and they don\'t skimp on the shrimps and scallops as well.
A cafe with truly unique tastes, though portions not filling and a little pricey. Better if they had a taster set to sample all their unique creations.  Hokubee beef bowl: the beef is chewy and yumyumyumyum. Grilled chicken was pretty normal, however the sides (maitake mushroom and yogurt mash potatoes) were fantastic, wish got more to eat. Overall good for the mouth and tastebuds.
Velvety smooth noodles accompained by a seafood medley of succulent prawns, fresh scallops and chunks of juicy crabmeat, swimming in a thick scampi and satay XO broth. Garnished with sprigs of spring onion, and halved cherry tomatos.
Bisque and chowder have been close to my heart for a long time and after trying scampi sashimi in Sydney many years back, I have not bothered with lobster sashimi since. To have two loves of my life married in a single dish, together with mee sua and fresh seafood, this dish is absolutely delightful. I will go back for more!
With a menu boasting dishes of French, Italian and Japanese influences, Gastrosmiths offers elevated comfort food in a casual and laid-back setting. Their signature Hokubee Rib-eye Don ($28.50) is a favourite ‚Äì with thick, tender, and beautifully charred slices of Hokubee beef atop Japanese furikake rice. Say yes to the sous vide egg (add $2) to coat the rice and beef in its oozy, yolky glory.
Was pretty bummed when they removed my fav cod fish Mee Sua off the menu. They had swapped that thick creamy and oh-so-soft Cod with tiger prawns. Still worth a try though! Really interesting Asian-Ang Moh fusion. Not a single strand of Mee Sua was spared and everyone at the table loved it! 
Oh gosh! This is food orgasm. The lava cake was super rich and served hot. The menu did mentioned that the serving time takes 15 to 20 minutes. As usual, vanilla ice cream beside a lava cake. They upped the lava cake game with that banana cream on the side. It was so nice as it goes well with the lava cake plus ice cream combined. üëç
It tasted like crispy.chicken.bites. The only selling point is that they are super crispy. That\'s all. The batter was too bland and the chicken was a little dry and tasteless. I\'ll skip this on my next visit.
I finally finally understood why there were so many rave reviews about this dish. It was delicious especially with the additional egg. They didn\'t waste that good piece of meat!
The mee sua was very nicely done. I wonder why the mee sua didn\'t stick together in a lump after it turned cold. They added lotsa olive oil, maybe? Although there was no wow factor to the taste, I applaud the chef\'s skills of keeping the texture of the mee sua just right and not soggy. The cod fish was my big disappointment. It was overcooked and dry. üò¢
Although I wouldn\'t say it is an acquired taste but adding shio-koji does make a normal seafood marinara taste different. It was said that shio-koji is to enhance umami of dishes but if you are aversive to fermented stuff, you might not like the aftertaste of this pasta. Personally, I like the japanese fusion twist to it.  üòä
The fine smell of truffle oil was in the air once it was placed on our table but it tasted too average for the price of $11.50.
3 flavours available: White Grapefruit, Blackcurrant and Bloody Orange. Refreshing attas sparkling juice priced at $7.50 per bottle. You might find the Blackcurrant sparkling juice taste familiar coz it kinda tasted like Ribena..
One of the most interesting dishes on the menu - this was a fusion dish that was really flavourful, and the fish was done really well! üåüüåüüåüüåü
Hokubee ribeye bites with furikake rice and sweet vinegar
This lamb shank braised with gochujang and red wine is totally awesome. Meat is tender and easily detached from the bone. Filled with intense flavors from the marination and stew, not too spicy neither does it taste too astringent, it was a well balanced taste instead. The accompanying smooth and silky pomme pur√©e is praise worthy too! 
Tender braised lamb shank that almost achieve melt in your mouth denotation. Full flavors well infused right to the bone after the long hours of braising with red wine and korean chilli paste. Definitely one gastronomical experience you can look forward to! 
I can\'t Brie without youuuuu. Each plate comes with four pieces of heavenly creamy yet crispy/salty-ish Brie. Really good for sharing but I don\'t like to share this. I want it all to myself üòã
Ngo hiong flavors overpowered any taste of foie gras -- did not turn out to be the marriage of tastes and textures I was hoping for
This Pork Collar Ragu is one of the best pastas I\'ve had recently. Gastrosmiths was really generous with the succulent shredded pork, giving each juicy bite a wonderful burst of flavours. Al dente linguine, nicely shredded parmesan - it stole my heart.
I\'m not a fan of foie gras so naturally this didn\'t appeal to me; but my sisters gobbled them up with so much gusto I can\'t say I wasn\'t impressed. They loved it! The flavourful marinated mince and fried beancurd skin proved an unexpected pairing to the bold foie gras. Dipped in the wonderfully tangy and sweet sauce, the combination of flavours and textures were nothing short of amazing.
I\'m running out of adequate adjectives for this - it\'s that good. An umami clear broth, packed to the brim with sweet daikons, leeks, and earthy mushrooms, was the perfect complement to the oily confit of halibut. The fish was amazing, the broth stunning, there\'s nothing remotely worth criticising.
The beef was definitely tender while the onsen egg made the dish even more delectable. I wished the rice was hotter though. $28++
G.S Apple for dessert. Featuring compressed apples, brown butter cake, oatmeal almond granola, apple clouds, it‚Äôs a party in the mouth when you take a spoonful of it as there are different textures from the ingredients and it‚Äôs a refreshing end to the meal.
For $8.80 this is an excellent dish with that gooey texture on toast and saltiness from the jamon to give it flavour.
Truffle eggs and smoked caviar bruschetta - so good I wish it were served in bigger portions as a main course 
Ingenious sweet and savory pairing - br√ªl√©ed Brie, melty and crunchy textures on crispy toast. A bruschetta good even when cooled! Coffee is decent, but the toasts were such joyful morsels that I can\'t wait to try other dishes.
This was highly recommended by the waitstaff as \"most Instagram-worthy dessert\". But apart from the pistachio ice-cream that was quite good, the deconstructed cake part was un-memorable. On a side note, I\'d like to commend the ever-attentive and initiative staff who arranged the birthday writings and candle when he overheard that we were celebrating a birthday. And thank you to the chef/manager who graciously waived this off our bill too! 
A safe option for dessert which is better than average but not impressionable.
When I first had this 6 months back, I was mentally grumbling about the measly amount of mushrooms. This time, as if Chef has heard my silent complaint, my pasta was generously loaded with a mix of delicious saut√©ed shrooms, so much so I almost didn\'t notice the onsen egg hidden underneath. Taste is still as good as I remember it to be too!
Good morning!! It\'s a new week again, rest is never enough üò© [COFFEE X CHOCOLATE X BANANA CAKE S$5.50] üòç 1 of the special desserts that night. 
This medium rare hokubee ribeye is perfectly seasoned but unfortunately too chewy that I had to spit out parts of it.
Forget truffle fries (most are made with chemically concocted truffle oil anyway!), these tasty poutine fries dressed in chicken gravy and cheese shavings are so much better! Even health-conscious me found it impossible to stop. 
Added the 63degree eggs and the whole dish tasted amazing!! Super impressed with the quality of food here 
Highly recommended!!! There was so much pork that I could barely finish the pork even after devouring the pasta! 
Tender and delicious beef on seasoned Japanese rice, served with their signature 63 degrees egg. Best! 
Lightly fried cod served on meesua, fried with a super yummy sauce of kimchi pur√©e and mirin
Truffled eggs, smoked herring caviar and scallions. One of my favourite dishes from this eatery. Everything on this dish complements each other. The texture of the egg is perfect as well. Must also try their G.S. Poutine and 63deg eggs!
I found this too expensive for the portion. The taste did not match up as well. Quite disappointed.
I really enjoyed this dish. The pork ragu was tender, flavorful and bright. I can actually taste the refined strands of meat. I liked the light tomato tones that\'s amidst the sauce. Delightful! 
Methinks the chef doth salteth too much, but the smoky sexiness of the seafood does some major redemption. 3.5/5
Most freaking awesome pasta that I have ever tried. 4 kinds of mushrooms with big slices of Parmesan cheese and their famous 63degrees egg on top of the pasta for about only $20. Every single ingredient was cooked to 101% perfection. The portion was just right! Usually I get so full from eating the pasta noodles but this time round i got full from eating the mushroom (they were really generous with the mushroom!). SO GOOD that I am at a loss for words! So no matter if you are a mushroom or non-mushroom lover, this pasta is a must try! Will definitely revisit the place to check out if there is any more unknown treasures!
One of the best poached eggs I\'ve had in cafes! The slight touch of Japanese infusion was amazing. To start off, what stood out was the seaweed (who would expect seaweed on eggs?) it was marinated and flavored so delicately with a blend of sweetness, saltiness and a hint of spicyness. It was just the umami flavour. Moving on, the smoked salmon were so fresh, and portions were generous. They were not overly salty (like those typically found in cafes), and could tell that they were marinated before, as it bore saltiness and a tinge of sourness that rightly balanced out. And the eggs, oh goodness they were so good! Reputedly known as the 63 degrees eggs, they were beautifully presented as the yolks were large and yellow, and when slurped in one shot, it was just heavens. They were cooked just right, and just so amazing when paired with the seaweed and smoked salmon. It was extraordinary how the chef managed to infuse Japanese elements into such a western dish of poached eggs to make it so unique. And oh yes, the bread of the day was oatmeal bread, and as ordinary as it sounds, it was not. It was toasted just right, not too dry or hard, and still soft and fresh in the middle. Amazing combination. Will definitely be back for other dishes! 
Yet another amazing dish rendered by Gastrosmiths. This was an extraordinary dish and we were truly blown away by the quality of the ingredients. There were 4 kinds of Japanese mushrooms used (pardon my forgetfulness of their names), and they were sliced SO thick and fresh, and then layered with generous slices of Parmesan cheese that went so incredibly well with the al-dente pasta and mushrooms. There were also hints of truffle oil used. Just amazing. Will definitely be back for so much more. 
Wouldn\'t consider it a \'magic-al\' cup of coffee as it was rather ordinary. However, it must be credited for the right balance of milk and caffeine, and it was neither too milky/ frothy or overpowering. 
Mushroom Linguine - Maitake, Cremini, Eryngii, Hon Shimeiji, 63 degree egg, Parmesan - @ the Gastro Smiths. This was really quite enjoyable. One of the best mushroom pasta I\'ve had.
It\'s like giving your parched mouth and tongue a pampering holiday. The lemon tea jelly was a revelation! 4.25/5
63degrees egg paired with jamon serrano, pickled onion, onion soubise, and house-made toast. Light brunch because I\'m surviving on 3hrs of sleep.
This. Is. The. Bomb. Nevermind that it can get a little too heavy after five bites, because those first five bites are enough to knock you out from bliss. The port-infused sauce of cream and tomatoes is rich and jam-packed with flavour, while shreds of tender pulled pork add a toothsome bite to the linguine. I want to eat this. NOW! 
Very satisfying dinner with @ccher and @missmandyy earlier tonight, even though almost everything we had was a tad too salty. 
After celebrating our anniversary last year at the fanciest of high-end restaurants, Restaurant Andre, we decided to go to somewhere more humble (and wallet-friendly) this year. What polar opposites! While Andre was all about fancy presentations and subtle (albeit sometimes confusing) flavours, Gastrosmiths\' food was good ol\' hearty umami packed deliciousness! Our starter of scallop ceviche was light and fresh. Things got even better for the main courses. J\'s cod fish mee sua was sublime - the cod fish expertly grilled and the mee sua coated in luscious umami goodness. My ribeye donburi was equally great - the beef perfectly medium rare and tasting as good, if not better, than the much more expensive cuts at Fat Cow. Our apple crumble dessert was also a delight - an inventive version of a very old skool dish. One of the best eats this year! I\'ll be back. 4.5 nombles.
The fries hits the umami spot! Must be the sea salt doing its thing. Coffee was good as usual
Last night, interesting plate dessert design of our strawberry shortcake, enticing out both our sight and taste
It\'s pure pleasure when the food tastes good and looks even better. Bigger portion for me pls üôãüôã
One of the more promising new cafe that serves food with a twist - shoyu latte, shio koji prawn linguine. It\'s not easy to implement a couple of flavors into a dish but they did it so yup. I can\'t describe it so you can only go down to try it for yourself 
Seasonal seafood present were stingray, crab meat &amp; scallop. The rice tasted kinda flat, was expecting something more heavy flavored. However amongst the rice bits I could still taste the seafood itself. Maybe it\'s just how this dish is meant to be; to not let seasonings overpower the original taste of the seafood. Portion is really huge, good for sharing. Seafood lovers &amp; the healthy conscious ones would like this. 
One of those mains that doesn\'t look fanciful but the taste will win you over. There was this creamy texture, similar to what cream based pasta gives you. Pork itself were real flavorful, soft and there was a generous amount of it. I couldn\'t stop gushing bout it for each bite I\'ve taken. Must try &amp; I\'ll go back for it!
Consists of: hokkaido sashimi scallops, yuzu, koji.
Very affordable mains and the dishes are extremely well done. Eg, rib eye beef and prawn pasta. Shoyu caramel latte is good too!
Thick and juicy slabs of beef set on a bed of flavoured Japanese rice. Deliciously indulgent. 
What was The Humble Loaf\'s signature dish. S\'okay.
It was so sweet of the chef, Jodin and his team to surprise me with this dressed-up banana cake (complete with a forever-flaming candle) when they found out it was my birthday. Pretty presentation aside, the cake itself was really marvelous in terms of taste.\n<br />To get it so moist and rich with banana flavour, the chef and his fellow baker explained that they use only the very, very ripest of bananas to make it. We\'re talking bananas ripened (via a \"secret method\") to the point where the fruit becomes completely pitch black in colour. One such banana was even brought out of the kitchen as proof!\n<br />For me, seeing their effort to get the best out of a single ingredient that goes into the making of a one item alone, really impressed upon me the GastroSmiths team\'s deep passion for creating food of quality. These guys have definitely got my support.
The clincher for me is that even the bread for their sandwich is homemade. Naturally, it is designed to go like a dream with their creamy truffled mayo egg which comes garnished with fresh spinach and a side of barbecue-flavoured potato chips. Best to have it with a cup of their Highlander coffee. 
After my third trip here, I am starting to realise that Gastrosmith\'s \"specials of the day\" tend to be very interesting discoveries :)\n<br />Making an appearance this time was the tenderest of juicy chicken bites coated in a light, crunchy batter and served with an addictive piquant, mildly-spicy Asian sauce (homemade of course). They are nothing short of being downright fab! 
The bowl of shoestring fries are doused in a little chicken gravy and light cheesy Mornay sauce. This softens the crunch factor of the fries, making it slightly chewy and soaked in yumminess in parts.
This is for the chocoholics who have a soft spot for bananas.\n<br />Under the scoop of chocolate ice-cream with shards of chocolate stabbing it, is a pile of chocolate crumble (it has a sandy texture not unlike a smashed-up chocolate cookie with a touch of salt in in). Buried within like treasure are pieces of soft warm bananas. When you pop all of these at one go in your mouth, you get an interesting mix of textures. In short, this is a fun dessert to indulge in.
The Cremini Mushroom Linguine tastes great but the amount of mushroom was pathetic :( I just couldn\'t figure it out because I also ordered a prawn linguine and it had many prawns in it. That aside, i really liked this dish. Smooth linguine noodles coated in a mixture of flavorful cream sauce and runny eggyolk can\'t really go wrong.
This exceeded my initial expectation of being just another average-tasting tomato based pasta. The sauce was thick with tomato flavor and was very appetizing with the right balance of sweetness and tang. I was also pleased with the generous portion of shrimp, there were at least 8 pcs? 
Lured by the multiple burps I have seen, headed down and tried exactly what was recommended. Personal favourites? The mushroom linguine was very nicely done. So was the prawn linguine in fact. Truffle Chopped Eggs sandwich was a well crafted combo which will appeal to any eggy person just like the Sea-ly eggs would too. Im coming back
This dish doesn\'t appear on the regular menu as it was a special of the day. To be honest, the steak wasn\'t the most tender even though it was medium rare. However for the price, I think it\'s more than acceptable, especially since it was well-seasoned and prepared with a lot of attention and care. I could taste butter in every bite of that deep red meat which made me happy since I am a big sucker for butter. The frites were just right too - a golden crisp on the outside, soft and potatoey on the inside, and evenly-salted all over.
Their homemade Alfredo, a classic sauce made of parmesan cheese and butter, coats the al dente pasta thoroughly. It\'s boosted with ground black pepper, plump mushrooms and a cannot-go-wrong soft boiled egg. Swirl all of these together for a majorly appetising dish.
The distinctive taste of this latte comes from Japanese soya sauce being mixed with caramel to create an unusual Asian-flavoured salty caramel. This is then blended with the medium roasted Supremo blend from Highlander Coffee. I find that the \"shoyu\" caramel rounds off the fine acidity of the coffee nicely without making it sweet, which is what other caramel flavours tend to do.
Deliciously salty and moist, the duck rilette was rich with so much flavour. Complemented by shallots, Dijon mustard and raspberry coulis, the duck rillette went terrifically with the toasted bread which was cut into a size that\'s convenient to pick up with your fingers for munching. I found them scrumptiously addictive and ended up eating more than my share - oops! üòâ
Chocolate lava cake was above average. Ice cream was too sweet
It\'s essentially a pair of half-boiled eggs luxed up with some Scottish smoked salmon, marinated nori and a dash of chilli oil. Appetising but not very filling. I\'d recommend having it as a warm-up dish, then move on to the more substantial items in the menu.
Crafted deconstruction is what I\'d call it, and divine is how it tasted. So pardon me for hijacking this dessert from my friend to have it all to myself because resistance was futile.\n<br />Waltzing happily away with the soft caramelised apples were creamy orange mascarpone, ginger flavoured crumble, honeycomb bits and a honey walnut ice-cream. They made such a beautiful mash-up of wonderful textures and flavours.
Clearly it\'s a tomato based spagetti but it\'s far from boring. The \"dashi\" and white wine brighten things up considerably, turning it into a seriously gratifying plate of pasta.
If you like your wings super crisp and coated in a sweet, savoury and slightly tangy house-made sauce, these ones\' got your name all over them.
Gastrosmith is a brand new place that serves coffee at the corner of the Bras Basah area. Ordered the salmon sandwich and a cup of flat white. I enjoyed the toast and the pretty generous salmon servings. Hope this stays! 
The people behind The Humble Loaf have come back stronger to provide a unique blend of European and Asian flavours - in a much larger space that accommodates 50, in a far more convenient location. Doing much more than just sandwiches now, you can indulge in the ever-popular 63¬∞ eggs with jamon, Creamini Mushroom Linguine, 200g Hokubee Ribeye Bowl, and share a communal-sized rib eye. If you drop by for tea, they also have desserts and pastries to go with their shoyu caramel latte. They\'re still in the early days of their launch, head down to support these earnest guys, they deserve it!
The Valrhona Chocolate Lava Cake is probably one of my favourite indulgence of all times. I wished I took a video when I dug into that piece of heaven - how all the gooey goodness exploded and blended so wonderfully with the pieces of banana slices and vanilla ice cream. Can\'t wait to go back for this again!
These eggs aint silly at all!  Power pack flavour of chili oil, chives, seaweed and smoked salmon. Just that they are probably not used to the kitchen yet, their 63¬∞C eggs aren\'t runny.
Fully vegetarian cream based pasta, huge chunky mushrooms and the sauce isn\'t gelat, and it\'s more like mushroom pur√©e topped with that beautiful egg in the middle! Mix and tuck in! 
Beans from highlanders, liking its robust taste and slightly bitter tone! 
the wok sauteed mushrooms were ridiculously flavourful yet remain truthful with that little earthiness. paired with cheese, the well executed combi was immensely savory af.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpproved #burpplesg #foodie #foodart #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodcoma #igsg #instafood #foodpornsg #sgfoodie #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #igsgfood #sgfood #singaporefood #sgdining #restaurantsg #sgrestaurants
Chicken karaage with caviar in a sandwich did sound like a bomb, but sadly the caviar didn\'t add much oomph as what I expected it to be. But I quite enjoyed the fried chicken ‚Äî every bite was juicy and tender!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #chicken #food #sandwich #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat
Something different and tasty worth a try.
üòå I do sometimes, and last night was one of those times. For 3 seconds, I forgot I was on earth. Take my money pls @gastrosmiths! üòö Definitely wanna go back to try the ribeye donburi.
However, the soup that came along with it was a disappointment as it tasted very bland even with the minced meat added within.
‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />This is a somewhat unique pairing of east meets west. Smoked cappellini laksa. Cappellini resembles our local chorbeehoon (white noodle) except that this is thinner and it does not turn soggy. Garnished with mussels, scallops and their special fish cake. The spices used to prepared the rempah was actually smoked thereby resulting in a tinge of smokyness in the broth. What one gets from the bowl was a hint of smokyness, slight coconutty and a subtle comfortable spicy heat. I really love the fish cake. Not salty or fishy and had a delightful bouncy texture. My first time chopsticking cappellini. So weird right? But it is unique.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />A east meets west dish that is same and different. @gastrosmiths also offers a 3-course set lunch on weekdays at $15 nett. Alacarte items starts from $19 and at nett prices.
The furikake rice was well-seasoned that tasted even better when mixed with the sous-vide egg, sprinkled with ao nori to complete the umami-filled bowl!
- Signature Hokubee Ribeye Don from Gastrosmiths ($26) Furikake rice, perfectly wobbly onsen egg and marbled ribeye seared to a beautiful medium rare. Luxe enough to be a treat, yet affordable enough to be a regular favourite. Portions could be larger but hey, I guess that\'s one way to keep me coming back for more. #gastrosmiths #allthingsdelicious #thisCuriousCraving #epicuration #onthetable #onthetable_sg #thefeedfeed #burpple
An excellent lunch or dinner option would be the Signature Hokubee Ribeye Don ($26), one of their outstanding dishes with those medium rare slices of ribeye served on top of furikake rice, that all important sous vide egg to bring all the elements together and finished with au jus. Besides the mains, they have a range of unique starters and beverages that you will be spoilt for choice.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @gastrosmiths and many thanks to @burpple for the invite.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Gastrosmiths\n<br />Address: 112, East Coast Road, i12 Katong, Unit 03-06, Singapore 428806 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #gastrosmiths
I also had the truffle egg crostini and topped up $2 for the shoyu caramel latte for dessert (an intense salted caramel). Overall, the fusion  concept which was executed well. Bottom is the ala carte special order steak 600g (med rare). Apparently they are going to move to the east soon so it\'s the last few chances to dine at their current location. \n<br />Disclaimer: Cant really be certain about the gst/svc charges because it was a treat. \n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #fusion #meesua #mussels #steak #burpple

Nice place with fusion cusine!\n<br />I had the fisherman\'s mee sua which was actually beehoon in some kind of seafood bisque! Very flavourful.\n<br />The signature hokubee beef bowl was also very good. And so was the scallop ceviche! And they had a very interesting shoyu caramel latte on the menu. \n<br />#omnomnom #whati8today #burpple #whatdiet #vscocam #gastrosmiths

Perfectly cooked medium rare on top of soft mash potatoes.
Nicely cooked white fish with a gingery tasting soup. 
Already back for seconds, or maybe I just need a lifetime supply of their all-incredible gastronomic delight of fusion cuisine. Honestly, what a apt choice of a restaurant name for this quaint lil shop sitting at the fringe of the bustling bugis district. I\'ve never expected fusion food to taste so good. My favorites were the must-try hokubee rib eye don ($30 with an onsen egg) and the hangar steak ($27, have you ever tried diaphragm meat!!?). The hokubee rib eye don is really perfected in every sense, from the runny texture of the egg yolk coating their well-seasoned, plump rice grains, to the fatty marbled texture of the rib eye slices. It\'s hokubee meat for a reason. Totally worth every penny. The only regret is that it doesn\'t display as photogenically as it\'s more well-known albeit subpar version *coughs tanuki raw*. Their unique yet down to earth cooking will definitely sit well w the local palette. Not to mention they use the french\'s method of sous vide cooking #healthy. What\'s not to love. 
Love the people, love the food

Woke up involuntarily at 6.45am and through the fog of my still half-asleep brain, thought it was a Monday and that I had another hour to sleep before getting out of bed for work. Woke up again with a start at 8.20am and panicked for a a good 30 seconds before the grogginess completely passed and I realised I\'d shortchanged myself of a lazy Sunday sleep-in. üò™ I need some fries in a creamy cheese sauce to console myself. 
The mee sua was a revelation, and begged to be slurped appreciatively. 4/5
The cake is really soft and nice! Thanks for the treat üòÅüòÅüòÅ

I didn\'t know what to expect, but this kinda blows you away! Complementary spices dance in your mouth, hint of heat right at the back after you swallow, leaving a yearning lingering taste that tantalises n teases you further, for another bite and another.. Beautifully seared cut of cod, seasoned with sea salt adds the crunch to your mouthful. Delightful. Portion not too small, gives you space for dessert; not too big that you\'ve had too much.
