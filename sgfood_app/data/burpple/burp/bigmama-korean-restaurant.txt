Shiok n spicy ramen hotpot was most suitable on a cooling evening! Spicy broth with kimchi, luncheon meat, sausage, dumplings, baked beans, rice cakes n ramen. 
Oh their side dishes r refillable, small portion but nice ;) especially the lotus and \'dong feng\' yummy yummy :D 
Another must try ~ one of my favorite dish in BigMama :) unique sauce ~ p.s: I actually prefers it w/o the sauce ~ awesome
One of their recommended dish. Now I know why it\'s recommended. It\'s really awesome..love the combined of the sauce, veg, rice cake, sweet potatoes and grilled seasoned chicken ~ thumb-up :) a must to try ya ~ 
$25, Steamed pork belly, to be eaten with celery and cucumber slices in black bean sauce / bean sprouts in spicy sauce / garlic sauce(?) pretty awesome.
Kimchi pancake with seafood! ($15?) 
Chives and seafood pancake
$12
Loved the lotus root &amp; myeolchi bokkeum! (Ok, spicy anchovies.)
Star dish of BigMama! Almost all tables order this. When u almost finishing, u can ask them to fry rice in it at $3 per portion. This is my 2nd time here and really enjoy the authentic flavor here. Definitely is one of my fav Korean restaurant.
Signature dish of BigMama! Simple taste but is appetising n delicious!
Missed this DIY pan-fried chicken dish since my December trip in Myeondong. #bigmamakorean #dakgalbi
Having Korean #food for #lunch at Big Mama!  Beginning with my meal with a can of #Sujeonggwa ! :)
#Latergram- Korean feast two nights ago. The Haemul Buchu jeon (pancake made with finely cut chives and seafood) was so good, best eaten hot!
#Latergram- Korean dinner two nights ago. Back here for the Dakgalbi (spicy grilled chicken). Very worth trying!
Finally trying out BigMama\'s food! Dakgalbi- Spicy grilled chicken. Not a fan of Korean food but this was good!

Ahjumma, can I more servings of the lotus root?
The pork has not much taste &amp; it\'s abit rough. Nothing special about this dish. 👍👍 #burpple #pickyeaterssg #bigmamakoreanrestaurant #8dayseatout #koreanfoodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #foodporn #sgkoreanfood #instafood #foodporn

do you know the different ways to eat Samgyupsal Suyuk?
:D
kflu, have to get Korean food fix.
Life is good with good vibes of foods and compliments around. After 2 weeks of dominating regimentation, i finally broke out to civilization. #foodporn #confinementperiodisover#yolo
Hmm..it tastes not bad but I prefers the soup from 2d1n :) 
🇰🇷
Yummy spicy grilled chicken! Stir fried with rice cake and vegetables. $15/portion, min order of 2pax. Can be eaten with rice / mixed in it. Which was kind of a ripoff, $3 for fried rice (ie white rice, then they mix it for you + add a bit of seaweed) or $1 (?) for white rice (which you probably can just mix them in if you want idk????) 
$50. We shared this among our 2 tables of 13 people in total. Broke kids are broke. $.$. Anyway, everyone loved this dish of well-seasoned beef slices + the ddeokbokki in it
Fried Rice is being tossed on the hot pan with the #Dakgalbi ! Yumz! #food
Yummy #Dakgalbi with rice cake, kimchi and a whole load of stuffs! #food #foodporn
#korean #seafood #soup... Let\'s dig in!! #food #instadaily #instalove #igers
Vege Chicken Sweetpotato in Spicy Sauce! $15/pax (min 2 pax), includes side dishes. + $3 for addition of rice = fried rice, which is not bad.
My new favourite korean place

Kimchi fried rice! 🇰🇷
Dakgalbi!
Korean dinner time with @totallyguan and @fredkieran 👘
Ending off lunch with fried rice with spam of sesame seeds, sesame oil, kimchi and seaweed. Very good!
Huge chunks of chicken with cabbage, carrots, sweet potato strips, and Korean rice cake. So mouth watering mmhmmm
