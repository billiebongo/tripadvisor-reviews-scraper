A light, fruity drink to kickstart our dinner. 
The Shakshuka is from their upcoming new menu to be released in a couple of weeks. Ottoman Kebab &amp; Grill serves up affordable Turkish and Middles Eastern favourites.
Cross-section of Icli Kofte 
Icli Kofte or Turkish Meatballs - Lean minced mutton encased in torpedo shaped fried croquette made of bulgur (cracked wheat). This dish is slightly on the drier side. The mutton\'s kinda flavorful thou\'.
Travelled to the East for BurppleTasteMakers tasting session at Ottoman Kebab &amp; Grill earlier. That\'s Head Chef Ali Kose with our Turkish coffee. Chef Ali has more than 10 years of culinary experience &amp; former Sous chef at Gordon Ramsay\'s Michelin-starred restaurant, Maze for 2 years. Despite years of culinary experience under his belt, Chef Ali is humble, friendly and funny. We had a fun time with Turkish coffee reading.
Served on a bed of baba ganoush, the lamb was flavorful &amp; tender. Lovely presentation too. 
A vegetarian take on the moussaka, done much the same style except without the minced lamb. 
A lasagna like dish, it has minced mutton, eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes layered with pasta &amp; b√©chamel sauce and topped with a thick layer of cheese. One of my favorite dish of the night, just had the right blend of ingredients. 
I normally love eggplant, but this was just an odd combination. It\'s grilled &amp; topped with peas, carrots, corn &amp; cheese. Would have been much better if those frozen vegetables weren\'t use and just have the eggplant + cheese.
This particular dish was a tad too dry, looks really good served but...the minced mutton inside was just tough &amp; not exactly flavored. 
One of my absolute favorite Turkish spreads, the Baba Ganoush here is perfectly smokey, rich &amp; creamy. I would go back just for this. 
Layered oven casserole with minced mutton. Layers of eggplant &amp; minced mutton topped with B√©chamel sauce and baked. Somehow, it reminds me of lasagna. This dish is rich &amp; creamy. Might feel \"jerlat\" after awhile. Best to share among few people.
At Ottoman Kebab, you\'re in the good hands of head chef Ali Kose - a Turkish native and the former sous chef at Gordon Ramsay\'s Michelin-starred restaurant, Maze. A telling sign of a good Turkish restaurant is the Homous, which Ottoman has nailed. Gratifyingly creamy with a balance of tahini, lime juice and garlic, mop it all up with the pillowy homemade Pide Flat Bread. Go for the Iskender Mutton Kebab: minced mutton patties grilled and slathered with a rich sauce of sundried tomatoes, celery, carrots, shallots and dried mint. Don\'t leave without trying the wildly popular Kunefe - a sweet and buttery pastry filled with goat\'s cheese, drizzled with sugar syrup, and topped with crushed pistachios.
Shredded phyllo pastry (ala vermicelli) crisped in butter, stuffed with stretchy goats cheese and drenched in a sugary syrup and topped with chopped pistachios.  Easily the best part of the meal and packs a real punch for the rather small portion.  It reminds me a little of our \'bomb\' prata, just more sophisticated (atas).
It comprises of stretchy nabulsi goat cheese encased within shredded kadayif phyllo pastry, pan-fried with butter to a golden hue, then drizzled with sugar syrup and crushed pistachios. It even came in the same aluminium cooking pan that I fondly remembered.
Indulge yourself with a touch of Turkey at Ottoman Kebab &amp; Grill.
I have to be fairly honest, that this coffee was good but not great.
What you see in front of you might not be photogenic, but this mutton kebab is absolutely delicious!
Ottoman Shish platter with chicken, beef and seafood kebabs along with pide and pilav rice. Yums.
I\'ve tasted better but it\'s nice to have this option in a mall. Will be back for the k√ºnefe though! 
I am missing this huge Ottoman Shish platter üòç suitable for sharing and also halal friendly so head down here for a good time! #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #burpplesg #savourworld #halalfood #latergram
P average
Really refreshing and clean taste
Babaganoush, as another starters for our full course meal. Given this as dips to go with pide bread (üëÜthe one at the back). 
One of their new item for the upcoming refreshed menu that will be launching anytime soon. 
Close up of Ottoman\'s version of Shakshuka, a new addition to their menu soon.
Shakshuka done in a salad version, quite good as an appetizer. 
They ran out of all d√∂ner kebabs at 7.00 pm !
Not my cup of tea (kopi). #OttomanKebab&amp;Grill
It\'s pan fried with butter till golden brown then drizzled with sugar syrup and crushed pistachios. Freshly made upon order and takes around 20mins but #trueloveisworththewait üòá #turkish #foodporn #k√ºnefe #ottoman #bedokmall #omg #ilovemyjob #perksofanintern #learningsthneweveryday #mindblown #yum
Some #Turkish desserts tend to be overly saccharine, but these were still tolerable.
