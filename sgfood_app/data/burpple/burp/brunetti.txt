Chicken Scaloppini; Chicken scallop cooked in lemon sauce jus and a serving of linguine aglio olio.
A pretty cake with a very deep-meaning name. üòÇ happy TGIF everyone!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Always so spoilt for choice - sugars for breakfast anyday! #foodporn #brunetti
If I had to choose one food item to eat for breakfast or brunch, I would definitely eat eggs!
Poached eggs on Italian ham with cheese served with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and bacon. 
Fried eggs, bacon and tomatoes cooked in a cast iron skillet with black truffle. 
Fried eggs, bacon and tomatoes cooked in a cast iron skillet with black truffle. 
Vanilla cronuts put side by side with Krispy Kreme original glazed. I think I will still prefer Krispy Kreme, cause cronuts seems rather oily 
Much better than Da Paolo\'s version, this one is flaky and comes with vanilla custard, topped with icing and pistachio shavings
Completely not worth the calories! Tasted like an overly sweet donut, struggled to finish.
Pretty tasty, though the texture wasn\'t that great having been left in the fridge overnight. Will have to try it fresh some other time! 
My verdict: go for the Nutella. The eternal favourite hazelnut spread lends depth and richness to the flaky, deep-fried croissant dough, taking it from one level of sinfulness to the next - might as well go all the way, right? I found the Vanilla too saccharine while its sprinkling of pistachios added nothing but colour. The Orange would be my second pick, though an orange-infused custard or glaze (it\'s filled with plain vanilla custard) would have given it the acidity it needed to stand out. Likewise, the Strawberry was lacklustre without a flavoured custard filling. #cronuts #foodfad #foodporn #sgfood #brunetti #burpple
Brunetti shows that Australian\'s are just as good in making this Parisian delicacy. Interesting flavours and colors of summer!
creamy and thick soup with plenty of mushrooms and with a dash of truffle oil. slurrpppsss!!!
orecchiette cooked in a different take to aglio olio. it was not dry and the spices used was really nicely put together
very colourful and festive looking macaroons, thou not one of the best ive tasted
From Brunetti\'s all day breakfast menu. A little too much oil?
Light lemon flavor. If you prefer strong lemon taste, try the lemon tart. 
Rum baba... Very soft n u can definetly taste the rum... Tea time @brunetti
Only the portion is small on my big appetite day and had to end up need to eat more meat at four fingers. I love icecream from Brunetti, only their waffles too soggy.

@limmeted #burpple
its actually 4 cream puffs held together by cream, topped with dark choco sauce. the cream puff was chilled and gave a refreshing taste when i popped one, really good! we ordered 2 Iced Latte (R: $7, L: $8.70) and was surprised that a scoop of ice cream was swimming in it! had a good time chatting away and coupled with the good food, ive enjoyed my sunday and certainly thinks my friend do as well. Brunetti, checked! #brunetticafe #brunetti #whati8today #8DAYSEat #burpple #dessert #potd #fotd #sunday
