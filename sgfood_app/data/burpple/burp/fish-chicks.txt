Came at 12+ but chicken was not ready. When I told the lady that I don\'t mind waiting, she keep repeating \"very long\" and she was not very helpful, didn\'t even bother to check with her colleague on the waiting time. She gave me the look of \"just buy the fish and get lost\" I mean, what if I don\'t mind waiting for 1 hour? It was Sunday and I had nothing to do anyway. Food was ok though. Just hope I will get my chicken next time. 
OMG finally get to try the western food at fish &amp; chicks !!!!!!!!
First time trying after the hype about salted egg. Find the taste okay only, not that fantastic. The fries is good thou😁
This is really not bad. We had the dish Best of Both Worlds which includes one piece of fish with salted eggyolk sauce and the other with chilli crab sauce. I love how their batter was done. It was flavourful and crunchy without being too oily. Preferred the salted egg yolk one tho. Also, the fries were pretty addictive! They added some spice to it which made it 👍🏻 crispy and good!The other sides were not that great. Don\'t bother to get the sides, get the main deal! Get the fish! 👌🏻
This is one of their two signature combos, and you get a choice of one fish and one chicken dishes from their regular menu.\n<br />See the full review at www.thehungrygeek.com under \"Singapore Hawker Food\" Category (active link at bio)
Get both then! 😀 We strongly suggest that you order the Best of Both Worlds to get a taste of both their incredible sauces. 😍 We finally went down to @fishnchickssg which has been flooded with people over the past few weeks! \n<br />See our full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/06/16/fish-chicks-best-fish-chips-singapore/ (active link at bio)
🌼Rate: 7/10\n<br />Waited for ard 15mins coz is not peak hour and cost like $12.90. Expecting high hope for this as it is legit highly recommended but.. prob won\'t come back again :/ Can hardly taste the salted egg as if I\'m like juz eating liquid yolk. The chilli crab is a bit better than the salted egg. Still can taste a bit of spicy in it but not as what I expected. Overall is juz 🐟🐟🐟. The truffle Mayo is not bad tho, I rather have that as the sauce than the chilli crab and salted egg.
Be there early if you don\'t want to wait \n<br />Rating: 4/5
Queued 45 mins for this. Wouldn\'t recommend eating this if you\'re starving. Fish is thick and the portion is big. $12.90 nett for each set meal. For this price, it is definitely worth the trip down to Amk to have it. We didn\'t manage to finish thou, the portion is more than enough for 2 pax.
photo looks better than it tastes. this came with fries and 2 deep fried fish with 2 sauce (salted egg yolk and chilli crab) plus choose another side. out of the 2, salted egg yolk tastes abit better. I won\'t queue for this nor go back for 2nd round
While the fish was great in texture with lovely golden batter, the sauce didn\'t wow me at all. The generous chunks of salted egg yolk were nice to bite but the sauce was rather mild in taste. At the same time, the chilli crab sauce tasted too tomato-ey to my liking and it was just ordinary. Not to mention my cold re-fried onion rings and not-a-single-tinge-spicy spicy tartar sauce. Giving them the benefit of doubt that its quality was compromised due to the crowd 😕
Finally got to try the Salted Egg and Chili Crab sauce Fish and chips [$9.90]  Looks like the hype has died down a bit since the queue wasn\'t as long as before even tho it was dinner time!Nonetheless, we had an enjoyable time with the crispy fish and chips done perfectly ! Moist and fresh inside as well! Could do with more sauce tho.
We went in the afternoon but was sold out! 😵Really feeling for fish &amp; chips so we went back in the evening. We got there at 6.45, queued for 1h before we could order, and got our food slightly &gt;1h later 😶 Lucky i wasn\'t too hungry that day else...👹👹👹 the batter was great: loved the consistency and the crisp it gave to the fish. I preferred the salted egg sauce probably cuz i ain\'t a huge fan of chilli crab to begin with (cuz the gravy is usually on the sweet side &amp; im not chilli-philia). Each plate is served with tartar sauce &amp; a choice of a dip. Truffle mayo is recommended (then again...i love the smell n taste of truffle) Verdict: YUMS! But would i spend another 2hrs of my life waiting for my food...Nahh! 😦 
We were lucky to get the last two pieces bef 1pm on a weekend! The chilli crab sauce is brilliant and very worth it for a $12.9 combo set. 
Boy I love how it tastes and it is not soggy at all. 1.90 dollars for 5 pieces. Better than mcdonalds nugget in my opinion. 4.5/5 rating.
However, I feel the salted egg yolk sauce could be thicker as the fish overpowered the taste of the salted egg yolk sauce. Also, the chilli crab sauce seems like lack the fragrance and crab taste like the sauce in zi char chilli crab dishes. The onion rings and French fries were fried well in my opinion. Not soggy at all.
Midweek spent with the cuz who lived in amk for a good amount of time but never ventured into Ave 10. It\'s about 6pm when we arrived, you can already see the kitchen busy and a queue forming. Waited for about 10mins before I got my order sent and the wait was about 30mins long? Pretty lucky considering some people waited for almost 2 hours for this. We ordered the best of both worlds combo which included the salted egg yolk and chilli crab sauce; came with chips(obviously) and a side of your choice for $12.90. The lemon butter grilled fish with tomyum fried rice was $8 if I\'m not mistaken? Anyhoo, being a big fan of salted egg anything as I am, I\'m quite disappointed by how lifeless the sauce looks and how little it was. Worse still, I couldn\'t really taste it; think more of zichar salted egg yolk sauce with sotong? And the chilli crab sauce had no kick. Don\'t really get the hype. But for a kopitiam, maybe there\'s an element of surprise? The tomyum fried rice was quite yummy. One thing though the fish was amazingly soft but it\'s a pity the batter is too oily for our liking. So we ate without it and without the sauce since it made no difference. I am only thankful we didn\'t wait too long for food of this standard. Don\'t think we\'ll head back for their fish and chicks? Maybe we\'ll try like their chicken dish if we\'re in the vicinity?
Technically not a cafe, but the plating and dishes available give cafes everywhere a run for their money. Add in wallet-friendly prices (think $12.90 NETT for this Best of Both Worlds fish and chips) and you have yourself the perfect recipe. For indecisive greedy people like me who just want to try everything, this is great! It has both their signatures, the Chilli Crab and Salted Egg Yolk Fish, as well as chips and another side of your choice. The batter is perfect, not too oily or floury and the flesh flakes apart at the first cut. As for sauce, I love love love salted egg yolk but this time, the Chilli Crab sauce won my heart. The chips are great too, like the LJS fries of the past that have a crispy edge. My only complaint about this place is the waiting time, it took us 45 minutes from the time we placed our order till we got our food - but it was too good for me to be angry for long. Definitely a must try.
Q-ing + Ordering + Waiting for food= 2hours on a Tuesday evening. I really don\'t mind the long hours wait if food tasted better •\n<br />-\n<br />- \n<br />Food taste was passable but I yet to find any wow factors. Chilli Crab sauce version flared slightly better but still it was abit too sweet than spicy, lack punch. As for the 咸蛋, we searched high &amp; low for it but dunno where it rolled to 😂 (吃不出). Hawaiian chicken was too dried and charred but marinates tasted ok. It would reflect badly if only sides can make it. Hits and Misses. There\'s definitely room for improvement!\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />🔹Best of Both Worlds $12.90\n<br />(Side Fries + Onion Rings)\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />🔹Salted Egg Sauce Fish &amp; Chips $9.90\n<br />(Side Fries + Coleslaw)\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />🔹Chilli Crab Sauce Fish &amp; Chips $9.90\n<br />(Side Fries + Cheese Pasta)\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />🔹Hawaiian Chicken $7.90\n<br />(Side Garlic Rice)\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />🔹 Truffle Mash Potato $6.90\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />🚩Fish &amp; Chicks\n<br />Blk 531 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10\n<br />Happy Hawkers Coffeeshop\n<br />Unit 01-2429\n<br />Singapore 560531\n<br />Tel: 9828 3490
Complemented well with the chilli crab and salted egg sauce. 😆👍 Would be more worth if waiting time was slightly shorter and more salted egg sauce was given
Because I also want to jump on to the @fishnchickssg bandwagon.
#burpple #foodporn #dinner #western \n<br />If you have lotsa time to spare for a so so food, do come and join in this crazy queue. Almost 3hrs just to see this. Madness.
The salted egg yolk fish &amp; chips is one half of Fish &amp; Chicks\' signature fish &amp; chips duo, which has been in the foodie spotlight recently. So is it really worth all the hype?
Can\'t decide between salted egg or chili crab? Why not both! The Best of Both Worlds ($12.90, includes a side of your choice) -- a killer fusion combination with strong flavours that whets your appetite to make you crave for more! This dish is out to steal Singaporeans’ hearts.
Situated at Happy Hawkers at Blk 531 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, this place serves western fare with no pork and no lard. They do have a salted egg version, but if you aren\'t into the craze you can try either the original or this Chili Crab variant. Coming with fries as a standard side, you get to choose another side and a dip (went with potato salad and garlic aioli). This was pretty delightful as the fish comes with a crisp batter deep-fried to golden brown perfection, encasing the flaky and fresh fillet within. Drenched in an adequate amount of chili crab sauce, it works as a \"sambal\" for the fish with its sweet and crustacean flavour with a tiny hint of spiciness without trying to make the batter soggy. Fries were crisp and well-flavoured, while the potato salad is garlicky with huge chunks of potatoes to bite on. For $9.90, it\'s definitely worth the money for what you get in return, especially for the quality despite being a coffeeshop western cuisine stall. Would definitely be back to try the other dishes that they serve!
Lobster Mentaiko Pasta. Totally not worth $16.90. The lobster meat wasn\'t fresh, was difficult to chew and difficult to peel off from the shell. However, the pasta was alright. The mentaiko sauce was savoury, cream and thick like how i like it to be. ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ✨#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower
Can\'t deny the bliss from peeling a fresh piece of lobster off the shell, topped with luscious creamy mentaiko sauce. \n<br />Also had their Best of Both Worlds ($13.90) which was essentially deliciously wicked fish and chips with their signature salted egg sauce and chili crab sauce. .\n<br />#lobster #mentaiko #fishnchickssg #fishnchicks

Tried Fish &amp; Chicks since we are around Ang Mo Kio area this afternoon. Perhaps the hype can tone down so there isn\'t a long wait before our food is served\n<br />. \n<br />We ordered Fish &amp; Chips ($7.90; comes with 2 sides) and Signature Fish &amp; Chicks ($13.80; comes with choice of fish and chicken dish plus 3 sides) for sharing.  The serving is big and indeed their breaded fish is good with crisp crust on the outside and juicy meat beneath. #cuisineparadiseeatout #fishnchickssg #fishnchips #foodblogger #burpple #instafood #f52grams #food #foodie

($9.90)\n<br />.\n<br />[+]: Generous fish portions- the insides were really soft and fresh while the outsides were fried to crispy perfection. Slathered with salted egg yolk sauce that goes so so well. .\n<br />[-]: not for people in a hurry. Though the hype has somewhat died down and there wasn\'t a queue when I visited, the waiting time was around 15 mins (look out for the waiting time signboard)- small price to pay for a really good fish and chips?\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm\n<br />#fish #chips #fishandchips #fishnchickssg #angmokio
😆\n<br />•\n<br />Sadly, all 3 components - fish, fries and onion rings - were pretty mediocre... #greasegamestrong 😝
The waiting time was around 30 mins but it was indeed up to expectations when it came.\n<br />The batter was airy and light and with not much oil dripping off it, it creates a stirring first impression.\n<br />The smooth luxurious texture and juiciness of the fish within makes the modest pricing really worthwhile although one could feel the salted egg yolk sauce though flavorsome could be slightly thicker.\n<br />The chips are delightfully crispy and contributed to the overall palatibility of the dish. There is a chilli crab sauce version as well for those who prefers something spicy
Something different from your usual Western food. #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg

As the crowd was crazy last month, I thought the demand\'s already decreased so it won\'t make me waiting so long today. Arrived there, I found the \"1 hour waiting\" notice. Oh man.. I suggest not to come at peak hours, especially on weekend.

Price: $12.90 \n<br />•\n<br />🚇: Ang Mo Kio \n<br />•\n<br />Best of both worlds, is a twist to the usual fish and chips. Drizzle with Chili crab sauce and salted egg sauce. The Chili crab was sweet and the salted egg had the taste, but I think both flavours are not thick enough. \n<br />•\n<br />As for the fish and chips itself. I got to say it was prepared really well. The outer is crispy and inside is airy. The fish is fresh and did not have any fishy taste. When you cut it, you can see chucks of pure white meat falling off.\n<br />•\n<br />Everyone is entitled to a side beside fries. The fries were great! I totally finish every single one. The cheese pasta was thick, if you love nacho cheese you will love this. But the mash potato had a weird after taste...\n<br />•\n<br />Overall, it was a decent fish and chips. But if the queue was long I will probably change my plans. \n<br />•\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #sg #sgfood #fishandchips #saltedegg #chilicrab #amk 
And only waited 15 mins for this glorious looking salted egg and chilli crab fish and chips! (The key is to go 30 mins before closing time😂). The fish was extremely thick and smooth and the crust was sufficiently thin such that it wasn\'t too gelard after a while. I preferred the chilli crab sauce over the salted egg one, as it was more flavourful and aromatic!! Definitely worth a try coz it\'s very value for money 😋the auntie in me was full and satisfied :) #Burpple #STFoodTrending #whati8day #sgfood #sgcafefood #tslmakan #cafesg #exploresingapore  #igsg #sgfoodie #onthetable #sgfoodsnaps#roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition #thelocal5everpiggie
yummy
Could do with more sauce tho
Worth a try if you are prepared to wait!
Just wish the salted egg sauce is a little stronger.
Was a little disappointed as the wait time for too long (40 mins) for this Best of Both Worlds set ($12.90) of salted egg and chill crab sauce fish. Too salty and oily, fish was tasteless and fries were hollow, overdone. But kudos to the guys for starting their own coffeeshop stall! Hope they can improve as time passes and get better. \n<br />Note that there are only 50 sets of each of these special sets (x3) for lunch daily (100 for dinner) and everything often runs out by 1pm/7.30pm - come at 11+am/6pm if you live nearby and want to try. Those living further -- there are better fish and chips out there. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fishandchips #chillicrab #saltedegg #fries #foodie #sgfood #foodsg #onthetable #whatiate #foodstagram #instafoodie #burpple #8dayseat #foodreview #instadaily #picoftheday
Tasty chilli crab sauce on fish but definitely not quite worth a grand total of 3h wait :( also, no need to bother with the salted egg.
Dun bother guys
