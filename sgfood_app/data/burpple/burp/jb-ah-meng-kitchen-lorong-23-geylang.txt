The bee hoon is flattened into a pancake/rosti-like form &amp; expertly fried, making it a mix of crispy charred (not burnt) bits with soft and silky noodles. There was a strong wok hei taste and it\'s unique flavour and style is definitely worth a try!\n<br />‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to make a reservation/ walk in before 5.30pm or be prepared to queue for quite long at this popular restaurant\n<br />üìçJ.

It\'s really hard to manage your expectations for JB Ah Meng because everything around the experience, from the Michelin love to the enormous crowd queuing for a table to the happy faces chomping away at tables practically bowing under the weight of generous platters of colorful shiny food, collectively projects one thing: the food is most likely awesome!  And‚Äã luckily, it really lives up to the hype!
Awesomely fresh and tender clams with great flavors!  Don\'t miss these if you manage to score a coveted table
This supper haunt has long been a crowd favourite for those hankering for zi char. Ranked number five on our Hot 100 (Hawker Edition) 2016, JB Ah Meng has shifted to its newer, brighter, air-conditioned digs and opens till 3am daily, making it the perfect place for supper. It\'s always crowded, so be prepared to wait in line. Portions are big and great for sharing, like the signature JB San Lou Bee Hoon (from $7 for small). Despite its lackluster appearance, Tastemaker Justin Teo loves how incredibly flavourful the flattened bee hoon is. The \'pancake\' of silky soft vermicelli with perfectly charred bits on both sides also comes fried with egg for added flavour, and cabbage for a contrast in texture. They also do a wickedly tasty dish of Salted Egg Prawn Balls (from $20 for small), White Pepper Crabs (market price) slicked in an unusual garlicky white pepper sauce, as well as Fried Garlic Chilli Clams (from $16). Tastemaker Zhihui Lim describes the latter to be fragrantly fried with garlic that provides a super shiok spicy kick. She also likes how the kitchen has removed the empty side of the shell, making it more convenient to eat!\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Zhihui Lim
Tomatoes egg has got to be one of my favorite homely comfort dish! A little silly to be ordering this when it\'s a supposedly simple dish to whip up (but who am I to say when I\'m a disaster in the kitchen?!). Definitely no regrets, it was so flavourful with a tinge of spiciness and we loved how all the different textures worked together - crunchy black fungus, silky eggs and juicy tomatoes. Only wished there were more eggsüòÇ#burpplesglatenight #burpple
This eatery in Geylang ranked number five on our Hot 100 (Hawker Edition) 2016 opens till 3am daily, making it the perfect place for a late dinner with your colleagues. Its always crowded, so be prepared to wait in line. Portions are big and great for sharing, like the signature JB San Lou Bee Hoon (from $7 for small). Despite its lackluster appearance, the bee hoon is expertly fried and flattened, resulting in a \'pancake\' of silky soft vermicelli with perfectly charred bits on either sides ‚Äî simple but so good! They also do wicked Salted Egg Prawn Balls (from $20 for small), Fried Garlic Chilli Clams (from $16 for small) and White Pepper Crabs (market price) slicked in an unusual garlicky white pepper sauce that allows the natural sweetness of the crabs to shine through. \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person \n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua
üòâLove the beehoon and clams. The rest were mehhh.. (Edit: the food has too much MSG! We are all so thirsty now after the meal. Guess it will be my 2nd and last visit here haha) #burpple
So glad this popular Malaysian-style \"zi char\" place does not churn out the standard stir-fried vegetables. Instead, you can trust them to have less common ones like this \"Snake Beans with Lotus Root\".\n<br />We enjoyed the fullness of flavour in here - made possible by cooking over very high heat with pork lard oil. The snake beans were succulent and crunchy, while the paper-thin lotus root were deep-fried to a crisp.
Another of their signature which I love! I find their white pepper spice to be more fragrant than the black pepper counterparts sold elsewhere, and it came with a sharper spice!\n<br />üî∏\n<br />At $78 for two crabs, you know they aren\'t big but the ones we had are full of roe. This would be added to the list of crabs I can recommend people for. #burpplesglatenight
A little crispy and filled with wok hey JB style bee boon!
Almost every table was ordering this, and we all loved it.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I started off feeling disappointed because the fried outer layer looked more charred and crispy than it actually was. However, the noodles were deeply infused with the flavours without being overly salty. Fried with egg for added flavour and cabbages added for a refreshing balance and contrast in texture.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Simple dish done well. #BurppleSGLateNight
We came at around 7pm and waited for half hour for the seat. We ordered the dishes and wait for another half hour for the dish. Had their signature dishes such as char bee hoon and salty egg prawn etc. The dishes are nice and tasty. Better come in a group and be prepared to wait...
J.B. San Lou Meehoon. My second time trying this and I like it just as much as the first time. Apart from the squid and tentacles. üòñ\n<br />Love the fried outer layer of meehoon most. This plate is perfect for sharing and even better to enjoy now in the new air-conditioned premises.\n<br />‚Äî J.B. Ah Meng ‚Äî\n<br />534 Geylang Rd, Singapore 389490\n<br />#JBahMeng
Didn\'t get to try this popular item on the menu the last visit when this shop was still in the dingy back alley. Now the shop is bright and air conditioned. This is nice to eat except the clams get a little tough when cold. \n<br />‚Äî J.B. Ah Meng ‚Äî\n<br />534 Geylang Rd, Singapore 389490\n<br />#JBahMeng
Their signature White Pepper Crab is to-die-for!\n<br />Besides the intense peppery flavour, there\'s plenty of aromatics from the copious amount of chives and \"kng chye\" used in the frying.\n<br />I wish their crabs were bigger but that\'s just me being greedy üòÅ
The \"La La\" made us go \"la-la-la-la-la-la\" all the way home üòã\n<br />Why? Because the clams had been saut√©ed in garlic, chilli and fresh herbs, which gave them a highly addictive quality.
Everyone comes here for this. Every table has it. Having finally eaten the \"San Lou Meehoon\" myself, I can understand why. \n<br />Although the noodles look crispy and hard in photos (well, at least to me), they aren\'t. The moment you lift up a bunch, you\'ll notice they loosen easily because each fragrant strand\'s remarkably soft and moist.\n<br />Mixed in this meehoon \"pancake\" are short pieces of cuttlefish and fried egg which gives the dish its flavour. Instead of being fried in, the \"chye sim\" is blanched and added to the dish before it\'s served. That\'s good because I dislike shrivelled up veg. \n<br />There were seven of us at dinner. So as recommended by @angelineongsuming, we got the largest portion ($16). Even then, I am sure if a second plate had appeared, we would have hoovered up every strand on it too.
The dish that surprised me most on my first ever visit to JB Ah Meng\'s was their \"Thai Style Fried Cabbage\".\n<br />Topped with crispy strips of beancurd skin, the still-lightly crunchy cabbage leaves had been stirfried in appetisingly-balanced flavours with just the right amount of sourness and the subtlest of spiciness. I found the result really delicious. Don\'t recall having had anything quite like it before elsewhere.
Imagine tender, moist strips of pork belly well coated in a savoury marinade of red fermented beancurd and 5-spice powder. JB Ah Meng‚Äôs Deep-Fried Fermented Bean Pork Belly (SGD $12 / $18 / $24) was surprisingly good with a crisp exterior and juicy inside. A tad sinful but having none of the usual greasiness, it was a well-executed dish though the earthy, piquant flavor was on the mild side.
..in spore. I must admit, it\'s the best white pepper crab i\'ve ever had. It has the white pepper aromatics and spice, hint of sweetness and umami. And very sweet, meaty crabs!
Honestly didn‚Äôt expect much from this but these strips of fried pork belly were actually quite addictive! I did wish for it to be meatier and for the fermented bean flavours to be stronger, but the crisp exterior and decently tender interior made it easy to wipe clean. It doesn‚Äôt come with any sauce so it might seem a little dry for some. You can also get the Small portion at $12 and the Large at $24.
 Really enjoyed this the other day I was here so I had to order it again - even though it was a little too spicy for me (love it but poor toleranceüò©). Fragrantly fried with garlic, with a super shiok spicy kick, and the clams were fresh and sweet. Having already removed the empty side of the shell, we loved how convenient it was to eat without having to pry them! 
Wanted to order 2 large (for 7 of us) but was advised against it that it\'s actually a lot BUT NO IT WASN\'T ENOUGH. Pretty sure we could\'ve finish 3 (or more?) large plates of this - probably the best version of the JB-style Beehoon I\'ve had so far - lightly charred with distinct wokhei goodness, fried with loads of vegetables, eggs and cuttlefish. Also loved how it wasn\'t dry nor overly greasy.
Not knowing what to expect at JB Ah Meng, my favourite item off their signatures was definitely their JB San Lou Mee Hoon ($7/$11/$14).
Despite the charred and flat exterior, the beehoon still retained some greasiness that made it even more enjoyable to savour. It had a distinct wok-hei flavour that permeated through the air upon being served. The addition of cuttlefish, kailan and generous amount of eggs made this perfect.\n<br />*\n<br />This place has been craziliy popular for ages and in the new location, the crowd seems to have multiplied ‚Äî so book your table a few days in advance! The service was very slow (especially to place your orders) so don\'t go there starving.
This was one dish I really enjoyed and will definitely reorder on the next visit! Clams were clean (no sandy bits), fresh and sweet. Throughly stir fried in lots of garlic, I just loved the fragrance and especially, the shiok small kicks of spice from the chili. So easy to eat too since they\'ve already pried them all open! You can also get the Small at $16 and Large at $32.
I remember this to be a lot better during my first visit at its old outlet before the shift. The crispy fried corn kernels were so addictive it even had us ordering another after sweeping the first clean! This time unfortunately, the prawns weren\'t as fresh and although it was so fragrant when served, the flavour didn\'t match up. Was hoping for the salted egg taste to be more rich and pronounced, with a little more gravy. Also, not sure if the serving size has changed or our orders were mixed up, we ordered the large but it felt more like medium considering the price tag. The small is at $20 and medium is at $30.
Didn\'t eat the crabs because I was feeling lazy but I had mouthfuls of its delicious crab roe! The thick white pepper gravy is as good as I remember, super flavorful, fragrant, garlicky and a little spicy. 
If somehow for some odd reason you can only order ONE thing from JB Ah Meng, get this. Mad love for the smoky wok hei flavour consistent throughout the whole dish, further elevated in texture by the thin strips of cuttlefish and charred bits all around. This is the kind of dish that disappears right away after it\'s served and that makes it even better because Êä¢ÁùÄÂêÉÊõ¥Â•ΩÂêÉ (food tastes even better when everyone\'s snatching for it)! 
Not in JB ah. Try the San Lou Bee Hoon ($7/$11/$14) if you haven\'t. It\'s Bee Hoon at its best. I still don\'t understand how Uncle managed to cooked until it looks lumpy and yet every strand is well soaked with umami flavours and wok hei. Some master frying technique there.
This is a must order at JB Ah Meng kitchen. It is chao ta but it just tastes so good! The \'chao ta\' nature of the bee hoon gives it a good subtle crisp, which is divine when mixed with the smooth and silky bee hoon. It also has quite a strong burnt smell, which can be poison to some and gold to others, so if you can\'t stand such a smell you might want to avoid this.
I can\'t stop eating this simple looking dish especially since the gigantic plate is right in front of me. The wok hei flavor is quite strong and the Bee Hoon is just slightly wet from the eggs. It\'s a food coma after having this with the other famous dishes on the table. We went to this hidden gem at Lor 23 just before it move to the new place at Lor 30. It is scheduled to be reopened next year Jan and I will definitely make a trip there when it happens :P
Awarded with a Bib Gourmand from the Singapore Michelin Guide, I loved how the restaurant was located in a well lit alley way in Geylang - much atmosphere and very affordable seafood - around $37 a person for two crabs, clams, salted egg prawn, noodles and tofu. The White Pepper Crab was a stand out - do not miss!
However, the phrase \"Do not judge a book by its cover\" certainly applies here. \n<br />The texture of the bee hoon is somehow moist and smooth. Not to mention you can taste the strong wok hei! I ordered the small portion which cost 7 dollars. However, I wish I had ordered a bigger version! A 4/5 rating.
The crab is certainly fresh and gravy is tasty too! Another dish that is a must order here. A 4/5 rating. Do note the crab price may vary as they will charge via market pricing as per their menu.
lol. little did he know that this is atypical fried been hoon pressed flat to a heavy \"wok hei\". burnt bits only serve to make this bid gourmand entry spectacularly fragrant! you have to give it that some of the most delicious food in the world is unceremoniously unhealthy. period. oh well, an unhealthy body but a happy soul right. i prefer to work on that spiritual cultivation. haha.
quite a kick. while i prefer this over the chili crab (the chili sauce was a tad let down and watery), it was still a pity that the crab wasn\'t plumb enough to exchange the spiciness. so you get all spiciness in the mouth but not mouthful of crab flesh to compensate. salted egg vs white pepper? I like yellow jokes you see. Hahaha
when my taiwanese supplier insisted he wanna order the omelette everyone is having. lol. little did he know that this is atypical fried been hoon pressed flat to a heavy \"wok hei\". burnt bits only serve to make this bid gourmand entry spectacularly fragrant! you have to give it that some of the most delicious food in the world is unceremoniously unhealthy. period. oh well, an unhealthy body but a happy soul right. i prefer to work on that spiritual cultivation. haha.
quite a kick with this peppery peppery albeit crab sweetness. while i prefer this over their chili crab (the chili sauce was a tad let down and watery), i would prefer a plump crab to interchange with the spiciness. so you can get all the peppery spiciness in the mouth with mouthful of crab flesh to compensate. that would really up the shiokness index. salted egg vs white pepper? I like \"yellow jokes\" you see. Hahaha
The charred bits sets it apart from other renditions, including from the said originator San Low Restaurant in JB. A definite must try if you\'re around the area! 
Outstanding rendition of a white pepper crab, the gravy is not too spicy, allowing you to taste the sweetness of the fresh crab. Better than many other places!
Another signature would be the white pepper crabs. They only serve small crabs at fixed price and if anyone wants bigger crab would have to make advance order. The shells are crushed neatly and it‚Äôs very easy to eat. Crabs here are fresh and solid, drowned in garlic and white pepper sauce „Äã2 for $51
Prawns de-shell and coated with salted egg. I was more interested with the fried battered corn kernels with salted egg as they leave a sweet and savoury crunch „Äã$20
This has a very nice sauce to it. It would be even better if the lotus roots were served hot and crispy „Äã$12
I liked this as a snack/appetizer to start my mouth moving. Nothing special about the fish skin as it‚Äôs quite common everywhere but it‚Äôs good that they have a small serving of papaya salad on top to infuse some crunchy and tangy flavours „Äã$15/Medium
Signature fried bee hoon infused with wok hei and served flat with egg, shrimps, cuttlefish and vegs hidden underneath. This will definitely fail in presentation but do not get deceived by it‚Äôs appearance „Äã$14/Large
Looking for a bee hoon with wok hei? Find it at JB Ah Meng kitchen. Hidden within this ugly layer of bee hoon, you can find a few handfuls of meat and egg. While it doesn\'t look like much, the beehoon is super flavourful, so much so, you don\'t need any ingredients to accompany it. A small plate comes at the price of $12 and a waiting time of 40 minutes. 
2 for $51. Wasn\'t as great a si expected.. The San Lou bee hoon is still the star fish at this place. Got devoured by the family before I could get a shot of it 
The crispy, sweet corn was a nice touch to the dish

The lala was covered with garlic giving the dish its own fragrance while also emits its sweetness for the tender meat. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />However the meat was too little and there was still some still were not cooked. It could be because they were packed on the day we went.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, it is still a decent dish and I will definitely give it another try when I am there again. Because nothing Beats a good plate of seafood!
Price: $12 \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Aljunied \n<br />üìç: 2 Lor 23 Geylang\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Ah Meng Zi char is located in the back alley of Geylang. Recently, they were also nominated for bib gourmand, hence I would highly recommend to make reservations and order in advance. I waited for 50 mins before my food arrived. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />When you arrived, you could see almost everyone ordered this charred looking plate of bee Hoon, please... Order it! The been Hoon was nicely executed. It is infused with strong wok hey taste. Don\'t throw away the charred portion, it adds a crunchy texture! \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, it was one of the best been Hoon I have ever tasted and I will definitely be back.
The chao tar bee hoon is really chao tar. Very fragrant. The salted egg yolk prawn ball is more dry, not very saucey, but the fried corn is interesting. Brinjal and potato is soft and like the batter is like tempura. Finally the fried pork belly taste like har cheong kai. \n<br />#burpple
BILL: $82nett for 4 pax\n<br />JB San Lou Bee Hoon (L) $14\n<br />Salted Egg Prawn Ball (S) $20\n<br />Fermented Bean with Pork Belly (S) $12 \n<br />Cameron Highland Dragon Veggie (M) $18\n<br />Brinjal Potato with Chili (M) $18 
The prawns were very big and fresh, and each coated nicely with a crisp layer of salted egg batter. The addition of the corn fried in the salted egg batter gave it a nice extra crunch, and was super addictive! Almost like eating crumbs of salted egg batter itself. 
Usually not a fan of fried bee hoon, but the one from JB Ah Meng really impressed me. It had a wonderful wok hei, super fragrant, and was super tasty. It is quite sparse on the ingredients, served only with a bit of shrimp, egg and small pieces of squid. However that\'s not exactly a bad thing since the star is really the bee hoon itself. Must order! 
Set in a back alley in the heart of Geylang, this late night joint (open till 3am daily) draws the crowds with its signature JB San Lou Bee Hoon (from $7 for small). Despite its nondescript appearance, the bee hoon is expertly fried and flattened, resulting in a \'pancake\' of silky soft vermicelli with perfectly charred bits ‚Äî simple but so good! They also do mean Salted Egg Prawn Balls (from $20 for small), Fried Garlic Chilli Clams (from $16 for small) and White Pepper Crabs (market price) slicked in an unusual garlicky white pepper sauce that allows the natural sweetness of the crabs to shine through. Most of the small dishes are good to share between two or three. \n<br />Avg price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim
Loved that the white pepper sauce brings out the natural sweetness of the crab. Might have been the sweetess crab Ive had in my life. The san lou bee hoon was also super shiok cos of all the liao they fry it with.
Doesn\'t look like much. But the flavour and texture is to die for. Thin and silky, yet with bite. 
Went once before but was too intimidated by the location- down a somewhat dingy alleyway... Finally braved it as the reviews looked too good to resist! Was rewarded with some delicious zi char dishes. Staff were friendly and they even have menus in English and Chinese.  The lala dish was very fresh and the highlight was the sweetcorn in the salted yolk prawns. The beehoon was good but I would have liked it to be a bit more crispy outside. The king pork was ok but the cuts were quite fatty. Too much food for two but it had to be done! Next time, substitute the pork for some veggies ;-) 
We need to help @pinkypiggu find someone. Must: - Love God\n<br />- Love Her\n<br />- Love Chicken Wings \n<br />Please recommend someone good, must go through our interro... I mean interview. \n<br />#Áà±È∏°ÁøÖÁöÑÁî∑‰∫∫ÊúÄÂ∏Ö
Located in an alley along the \"busiest\" area of Geylang is JB Ah Meng. They have a few signature dishes and one of which is their lala! Big fat juicy clams stir fried with an abundance of garlic, spring onions and chilli padi. Each clam meat is still firm and emits the sweetness of the flesh when you bite into it. The empty clam shell of each clam have also been separated - you don‚Äôt have to pry open the shell to get to the meat, providing much ease (and speed) in the process. Definitely heading back for more of these lala!! 
Salted egg yolk prawns are a hot favorite amongst Singaporeans, and this was nicely fried till golden brown. There is nothing much spectacular about this prawn, but we were pleasantly surprised to find corns in the batter! The crispy fried corn kernels were super addictive and makes this dish memorable, haha. 
Exploring local eats that I don\'t usually go for on normal days. The fried noodles were crisp on the outside and delicious seafood was hidden beneath. Good comfort hawker food if you‚Äôre around the area. *
This plain jane of seafood and rice vermicelli, which is also known as JB San Lou Meehoon ($14) here, will not even warrant a second look but trust me, you definitely got to try it to believe the mastery that goes behind this \"flat\" bee hoon. Because of the frying techniques, the noodles were neither lumpy nor dry. The ends were fried till crispy to give a totally different texture from the inside. Located at a nondescript alley along Geylang, JB Ah Meng is my first hidden gem find in 2016.
Read reviews about this Zi Char stall and ordered the fried snake beans with lotus roots... Nicely done! Crunchy crunchy! I like it!! Yummy! üê∑
What a way to keep your mouths occupied. Light and crispy, but with a sweet spicy sauce that\'s forgettable. 
How to resist such well-battered prawns coated with luscious salted egg sauce, accompanied by overly- addictive corn crisps!?\n
We had JB San Lou Bee Hoon($7 -Small) looks plain and flat, but taste incredible! Soft yet Q bee hoon with fragrant wok hei flavour. Bits of tau gay, prawn and sotong stirred in bits of eggs. Smacking our oily lips after wiping the plate clean!
Not your usual fried bee hoon, after bee hoon\'s fried, it\'s further press fried such that the surface is slightly charred - brown and crisp. 
Bee hoon infused with sweet fragrance from the crabs. Wished it had more sauce in it. 
Served hot and crispy üòã
Their san lao beehoon is still very good - a flat bed of vermicelli covered with meat and vegetables. It\'s charred and crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside!
Love the added crunch from the deep fried corn. And once you go deshelled, you can never go back.
Love the texture of this dish. Fried lotus and snake beans. 
In this vibrant Geylang back alley, dig into pan fried and flatted bee hoon, satisfying in its simplicity and wok hei. The Salted Egg Prawns are a hit as well, served with crispy corn kernels. If you\'re in the mood for crab, their White Pepper Crab won\'t disappoint with super fresh crab and pepper sauce that packs a good punch. Dinner\'s definitely not a bore here!
Ordered take away to cut the wait. Was told 30mins but my food wasnt ready until about an hour later. Hungry humans are nasty! \n<br />Service: HORRIBLE! \n<br />The cashier lady kept asking the wait staff to pack our lala 1st but was ignored. Doesnt help to know that my beehoon had been sitting there, turning cold, while the kitchen staff was slowly preparing each plate of lala, picking each shell by hand, weighing &amp; counting the numbers per plate. 
Love the plump juicy clams that soak up all the intense mouthwatering sauce. ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />When you see a dish that‚Äôs featured on almost every table, don‚Äôt even bother asking what it is, just order and enjoy. Sometimes it‚Äôs the little mysteries in life that makes the most impact and the countless of hours doing cardio. üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #jbahmeng #tzechar #zhichar #stirfry #lala #clams
Fried Garlic Chilli Clams, the plump and juicy clams were well coated with garlic and chilli. 
Our first time trying this dish. The sliced lotus root was crispy and yummy. However, the snake beans were a little bland compared to their other dishes which are typically strong tasting.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_jbahmeng #jbahmeng #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Our favourite dishes are the white pepper crab, san lou meehoon, deep fried fish skin and Thai style fried cabbage.\n<br />*\n<br />To be honest, most of the dishes we\'ve tried here were very tasty. Choosing favourites really depends on individual preferences. The 2 dishes which I would definitely recommend is the white pepper crab and san lou meehoon.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_jbahmeng #jbahmeng #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Ok, that\'s all.
One of the favourites which we tried for the first time during this visit was the Fried Garlic Chilli Clams ($16), which proved to be an instant hit and was wiped out very quickly. The juicy and plump clams had a slight sweetness to them while being coated evenly with garlic chilli that comes with a spicy kick. Recommended to make prior reservations or go super early like us (at 5:30pm) to get a table before the line starts forming during dinnertime.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />JB Ah Meng\n<br />Address: 534, Geylang Road, Singapore 389490\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock

Had a fabulous evening last night with friends old and new, all bound by our love for food! #friendships#loveforgoodfood #jbahmeng #Geylang #lorong30gelyang #zichar #burpple #bscc_chinesesg #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg
Unless Chao Ta (flat burnt) Beehoon, this wasn\'t burnt till crispy; it still retained the moisture and yet tasted 100% for the wok hei. The beehoon was non-lumpy and so delicious we easily finished it before the other dishes arrived. Highly recommended if you are one like us who just can\'t resist dishes with good wok hei. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #burpproved #beehoon #wokhei
Ours was no candlelight but we totally enjoyed our White pepper crab which was the signature dish at JB Ah Meng\'s. The white pepper sauce was absolutely satisfying with the spicy and garlicky taste. Also loved the generous amount of spring onion that added the extra fragrance. \n<br />This crab at Ah Meng\'s was just good stuff, fresh and firm meat that tasted of sweet even with the sauce. (Tip to enjoy good crab meat is to choose a male crab, unless you are going for the roe in a female crab)\n<br />Other delicious dishes we had tonight included their Chao Da beehoon and Salted egg yolk prawn balls. Be warned to make reservation or go really early to avoid joining a long queue though. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #burpproved #whitepeppercrab #crab
Personally I think it\'s hard to go wrong with salted egg yolk and this dish is evidential of that. The mini corn balls are addictive on their own.
Got aircon now! \n<br />#melfclar #‰∏âÊ•ºÁ±≥Á≤â #Geylang

The signature bee hoon noodles here, with its slightly charred, crisp strands, and savoury smoky flavour of wok hei / breath of the wok... delicious mess.
Tender, moist, fatty strips of pork belly, coated with a savoury batter of red fermented beancurd and 5-spice powder. Big, bold flavour!
Despite the exotic name, this is just a simple stir-fry of yardlong beans, celery, and semi-crisp lotus roots.

So apt to have this white pepper crabs (2nd stop) with my usual cafehop kakis.\n<br />‚óæ\n<br />There was not too much of the pepper \"heat\". Still could taste the sweetness of the crabs.\n<br />‚óæ\n<br />As always, the company was truly awesome. Had a great time. Thank you my wonderful foodie pals for making me forget the pain.
Taste was slightly on the mild side but very crispy
Food is simple yet so full of flavour and soul.
Tender, flavorful and so good!! Who wouldn\'t love dining with chefs? It was nice hanging out @amadofores and @margaritafores Till the next food adventure!! *\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />JB Ah Meng, Geylang, Singapore *\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #leica #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #beef #goodeats #wagyu #buzzfeast #food #sogood #delicious #foodcoma #foodgram #loveit #foodphotography #amazingfood #burpple #instagram #eeeeats #bbcgoodfood #foodlover

Very interesting dishes, nothing like the one I\'ve tried before. Not the best, but special. From top left, clockwise - white pepper crab (family was raving, but thought it was average. No shiok feeling), ÂõõÂ≠£Ë±Ü with fried lotus( supposed to be ËõáË±Ü, which is zig zag long beans but its a seasonal veg), fried prawn coated with salted egg (first time tasting a dry version, doesn\'t taste too rich like some of the wet versions commonly sold at zichar stall), fried brinjal (almost caramelised texture), fried fish skin. All for $102 to feed 4 full and happy customers. And it\'s quite an experience seeing some prostitutes roaming the back alley ( I assume they are cos they are skimpily dressed) #zichar #singapore #back #alley #geylang
There is something very humble and charming having zi char dinner at the back alley #zichar #singapore #sgfood #alley
must try So good
