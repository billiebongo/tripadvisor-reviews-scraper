With an extensive menu to choose from, you will be spoilt for choice at ParaThai! Recommended items include their Duck Red Curry (which was much more impressive than their green curry), Thai Chendol, Minced pork in rice noodle paper, Red Ruby dessert among many others üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
2 munchies: Not only did this dish lack the creamy texture and aroma of a Thai green curry, the sweet and spice were also unpronounced. I gave it a miss and went for the Roast Duck in Red Curry instead.
4 munchies: Though I\'d have liked stronger flavours and more moisture in the mildly sweet, homemade minced pork wrapped in silky rice noodles, it was still a great appetiser dish to kick start an authentic Thai cuisine experience at ParaThai ‚Äì Paradise Group Holdings\' debut venture into Thai cuisine.
Thank you, Paradise Group (the 2 Stanleys), for hosting @juliuslim and me at ParaThai this afternoon! My favourites were the Tom Yum Goong, Kway Teow Song Kreang, and Red Ruby with Jackfruit. #BurppleTastemakers
3.5 munchies: Besides finding the roast duck a tad tough, I wished for a stronger taste of the red curry and the spiciness to be levelled up. Fortunately, the mild sweetness and tanginess from the pineapple cubes, grapes, cherry tomatoes, coconut milk, and more than 15 herbs and spices make this aromatic Thai-Chinese fusion dish signature-worthy.
3.5 munchies: Although Chef Meaw\'s intention was to balance the basil and chilli flavours in this dish, I\'d prefer it a tad spicier for more punch. Thumbs up for the well-marinated minced pork with a hint of sweetness!
2.5 munchies: Not only the marination and steaming needed to go on a little longer to absorb more of the pandan fragrance before deep-frying the chicken chunks, the crisp on the outside was also lacking. I was hoping for a sweet and salty soy dipping with sesame flavours and a thicker consistency, instead of the watery and overly sweet chilli sauce that did not complement the pandan-wrapped chicken.
Full of creamy texture and flavor. Abit more sweet as I expected.
I would happily dig in if there is no cabbage and meat floss so called decoration but the taste is delicious.
I\'ve been eating Thai cuisine very frequently lately. This is Geang Keow Wan Gai, green curry chicken. Lovely üòã
Nice little starter of fried minced pork enveloped in chewy rice noodles and garnished with garlic and nuts. Think it could have been even better with a slightly stronger hit of chilli, though!
Sweet glutinous rice with mango slices. Served with coconut milk. Would be better if the coconut milk was thicker &amp; mango slices sweeter (was a lil\' sour that day).
No clear tom yum soup here, but that\'s okay. You don\'t need options when you have one reliable go-to.
We had the famous mango sticky rice, Red Ruby and Sweet Tapioca. .\n<br />|\n<br />Sadly, their ice machine broke. Resulting the ice to be too hard. The dessert could be much sweeter.
|\n<br />The spicy mouth watering sauce with the savory marinated beef steak. The taste was good but the texture was tough (because the chef used a very lean piece of meat). Sadly to say that the Thai beef has much lesser fat content so it is very difficult to overcome this downfall. .\n<br />|\n<br />Personal suggestion: If the marination was done by injection, the meat might be more tender.
Hor Mak Pla (Thai Style Otak-Otak) - Not a big fan of Otah/Otak, so I don\'t really fancy this dish. But I do love the presentation, especially when cups and cups of them were lying in a line in front of me! :p 
Suea means Tiger &amp; Rong Hai means crying/weeping in Thai. Word has it that this dish was once made so tough that even a tiger can\'t chew it. Hence, it got emotional and cried. Another version was that the dipping sauce was so spicy that it makes a tiger cry. Now, that\'s one emotional tiger. haha.
The rubies were essentially frosty, crunchy pearls that were enjoyably gnawable, but the jackfruit had much personality as Looi Sai Hiam from Class 4C in primary school. 3.3/5
Easily able to feed more than 6 pax. All the way from appetizing Tom Yum soup to mouth watering steamed water with lime and chilli.
Nor Mai Farang Phad Tofu (Stir Fried Asparagus with Egg Tofu and Mushrooms )
Even though the duck was tough, the curry was lovely. I will revisit just for their pandan rice and roasted duck curry!
(But I like it) The only downside was that the bowl was too small.
The indignant-looking seabass soaked in a homemade broth made using fresh lime juice, garlic, chilli, and spring onions among others. The broth was sharply tangy, enormously flavourful and easily the spiciest thing I had that night - two sips in, I was frankly dumbfounded that a mainstream restaurant served this, as it was positively auntie-clutching-stomach-and-fleeing-to-toilet-screaming levels of acidic and fiery (which might explain the seabass\' indignation swimming in the stuff, surely not good for the skin). Not for the faint-hearted. Oh, and the seabass was supple and very fresh too. 4.1/5
The curry was decently rich and I loved the crunch factor from the vegetables thrown in the mix, although methinks the roast duck probably played a bit too much basketball under the February sun. 3.5/5
That\'s how I like my tom yum to taste. The Tom Yum Soup with Sea Prawns ($7.90 per bowl/$19.90 per firepot) from ParaThai is a cauldron of goodness that packs a punch. A classic that always makes it to the menu at every Thai restaurant. \n<br />#FOODART #local #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #julsmakan #jiakholiao #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #foodie #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #vsco #vscocam #vscofood #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #thailand #thaifood #ParaThai #paradisegrpsg
My tastebuds were jolted by the hot, fiery sensation, sour tang &amp; natural sweetness of the soup. The piquant soup was flavorful &amp; I can\'t help but to finish it to the last drop.
Suer Rong Hai ( \"Crying Tiger\" BBQ Beef Steak )
Starting our Burpple Eatup yesterday is this Kway Teow Song Kreang (Homemade Minced Pork in Rice Noodle Wrap). Not only can you find minced pork, there is also traces of Cai Po (Preserved Turnip) in the wrap .
This Phad Thai Goong Sod (Thai Style Fried Rice Noodle with Prawns) looks exceptionally beautiful .
Three of my favourites from last night\'s @burpple Tastemakers eat-up, yes, even the uber-fragrant grains of rice tinged a pretty pastel green ‚Äì couldn\'t resist walloping almost the entire mound of it drowned in spoonfuls of that rich duck red curry.
Located at One KM, a new shopping mall at Paya Lebar! Seems like it\'s getting more eateries at that area üòã Here\'s Mango Sticky Rice for you sweet tooth üç¥
A common Thai dish, it\'s better the ones I had in touristy PHUKET, this is less oily and more tasty!
Fresh fish in a sweet savory Thai chili kind of taste. It comes in a very nice tray too!
Fresh prawns, extra spicy Tom yum soup. Perhaps the best dish of the night for me
Just a small collage of the various dishes we had for tonight\'s #burppletastemaker eatup at Para Thai. Been a crazy night for us especially for everyone at our table for we just can\'t keep our sanity the whole time; also great to finally be at a eatup with @thepoppingone after he missed the last one. Special thanks to the @burpple team to have organized this, and always looking forward to the next eatup as always; for the great food and company.
#reasonwhyimnotlosingweight Can\'t believe some of them are going for 2nd round at #beautypot üò±
Quite a decent attempt though mangoes were a wee sour and the glutinous rice a bit too sticky. However the sweetness of the glutinous rice does go really well with the coconut milk which is quite satiating overall.
Steamed Tapioca. Possibly my favourite dessert for the night because the Tapioca was just soft enough and covered in enough sweetness. Could do with thicker coconut milk though.
The only flaw I personally feel was the lack in sweetness in the coconut milk as sticky rice usually taste really bland and Mango itself isn\'t enough to cover and give it a strong flavor.

Not a big fan of warm dessert but this is worth a try as the combination is genius.                            Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
Particularly liked the red Ruby, can\'t take much milk personally though...
Red Ruby served with Jackfruit and Coconut Milk. Didn\'t like how the ice came in a sphere; it\'s frozen to a point where it held together so well it\'s hard to disintegrate it to get it to mix into the dessert. Coconut Milk was too light in flavour and felt very watered down, having a floral scent that came along with it. The only sweet part came with the pearls, which could do with more chewiness and slightly larger pearls for more flavour and bite?
Perfect dessert for hot weather, unfortunately the ice machine was down on the day we visited. So the shave ice that was served wasn\'t perfect but other than that. It\'s all good!
Thanks to @paradisegrpsg for the invite the other night at ParaThai and we ended our meal with Red Ruby served with Jackfruit and Coconut Milk (Tab Tim Krob, $5.90). Unfortunately, the ice machine was down that day and we were given a ball of ice which makes a difference in the taste. Also, I feel that the dessert could have been a tad sweeter as it was full of coconut milk taste. 
This dessert is perfect, refreshing and not sickly sweet. Red rubies are homemade and had that extra crunch which is a plus point. Must try! Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
An interesting presentation of the Thai style Otak-Otak or known as Hor Moh Pla ($10.90) in Thai features a spicy souffle of seafood and coconut milk served in a cup. (Actual serving comes in 4 portions) 
We were unfortunately served a bad batch and instead of the Otak Otak being all gooey and spicy fish goodness like it\'s meant to be, we had dry Otak-flavoured fishballs. Thankfully, the curious and pleasant inclusion of fish and cabbage at the base prevented it from being an absolute disaster. 2.7/5
Not the typical otak otak one would expect, it has an earthly taste but the fish paste at the bottom of it was pretty good!
It turned out a little harder than expected and less spicy, would be better if its more moist, tender and spicy! Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
Thai-style Otak Otak. Was told that the chef wanted to infuse a more earthy flavour with this dish instead hence the spiciness was being toned down. The result is a little bit lying closer towards our local Otah; the slight charred flavour was evident in the meat along with various other ingredients at the bottom including fish meat. Quite fine with it because I had always loved smoky Otahs without the overwhelming spiciness, though some may find this dish slightly underwhelming.
Phad Thai is like a national dish of Thailand, it probably is. The Phad Thai Goong Sod (Thai Style Fried Rice Noodle with Prawns $12.90) here is simply a traditional rendition of the delightful Thai dish, which is also one of favourite dish to date.
A bright and colourful mix of vegetables makes this dish beautiful as well as savoury. This is Nor Mai Farang Phad Touhu (Stir Fried Mini Asparagus with Egg Beancurd and Mushrooms $12.90), a good option for the healthy green lovers.
Pretty decent food, but it\'s more of a chinese food...
This dish requires no introduction, it\'s good to the extent that it\'s spicy enough, however it tasted more Singaporeans than Thai.
Can\'t really speak much about Pad Thai since I don\'t usually order this. Overall Para Thai serves up a Pad Thai that was sweet-savoury, comes with manageable heat even for those who are not as tolerant to spiciness and not too oily.
Essentially Phad Thai who was hit by killer litter - a bottle of sweet tomato ketchup - and never recovered ever since. 2.2/5
ParaThai offers a good selection of seafood dishes, featuring key items such as sea bass, squid and soft-shell crab. A noteworthy dish would be the Pla Ka Phong Naung Ma Nao (Steamed Seabass with Lime and Chilli $29.90), where the whole fish is steamed to perfect succulence with a special homemade broth including fresh lime juice, garlic, chilli and spring onions. 
This was pretty good; asparagus was soft yet retained a bit of its crunchiness and the tofu was soft without turning into a mush. The gravy was also pretty savoury and thick as well.
Phad Thai Goong Sod (Fried Rice Noodles with Prawns, $12.90) can be found in most Thai restaurants but what makes it stand out is if the chef fries each plate individually upon an order. ParaThai\'s version has the \"wok hei\" and noodles are not clumpy but I still miss the ones you eat along the street in Bangkok, especially from Thipsamai. The taste and \"feel\" is just different over there.
The chicken was curiously clumpy instead of being properly minced, which meant a natural spoonful includes loads of chicken and less basil and chilli. Perhaps as a consequence, the spice and flavour factor felt rather muted. 3.2/5
Really dry and rough, fortunately the spiciness made up for it. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
Beef can be served to any degree of rareness desired. Pretty nice way to eat a steak!
BBQ Beef Steak served with homemade sauce. Pretty similar to those grilled chicken rice sets from Vietnamese stalls. Meat was marinated in a savoury sauce which hinted a bit of lemongrass, and came with full flavour. While the ends were slightly chewy, the middle of the steak feels a bit on the dry and tough side; a bit of a pity given how brilliant it tasted.
Super fresh sea bass with a sauce that gives you a kick. The sauce was tasty with the notes of lime and enough chilli to make it shiok!
Minced pork/chicken with Basil leaves; a Thai classic. While the one served here isn\'t really as potent as some that I had tried, the minced meat soaked in the sauce to give a sweet yet slight spicy flavour. Don\'t attempt to talk while trying to down a spoonful of this though; I had learnt my lesson and you have been warned!
It is uncommon to find roast duck thai curry in Thailand, as they are mostly served in high-end restaurants. The chefs at ParaThai have reinvented the Thai Red Curry with Chinese influences by adding tender slices of roast duck, pineapple cubes and grapes into the aromatic curry broth that has been concocted with more than 15 types of herbs and spices. The Geang Phed Ped Yang (Roast Duck in Red Curry with Pineapple $14.90) is one of the popular and unique fusion and popular dishes at ParaThai. 
Geang Phed Ped Yang, Thai-chinese fusion dish. Roast duck was a little hard to chew, but the curry was real good!
My fav dish out of this tasting would be this! The special homemade broth is what makes it so yummy all of us were raving about it. Infused with fresh lime juice, garlic, chilli, spring onions etc made it light yet evokes sense of lingering spiciness that makes you want for more. Must have!

One of the meatier dishes that Para Thai serves is the Suer Rong Hai which translates to \"Crying Tiger\" BBQ Beef Steak served with Homemade Sauce ($16.90). There are many versions as to why it was called crying tiger but the ones that I remembered were that the chilies in the sauce was so spicy that it made the tiger weep or the cow was killed by the hunter and made the tiger shed tears. Back to the food: you can actually request for the doneness of the beef and unfortunately we were not told beforehand and the beef was served well done.
Steamed Seabass in Lime and Chili. Succulent fish that\'s doused in a zingy yet spicy broth that gives the otherwise bland-tasting fish a really refreshing taste that washes away that thick flavours of the Red Curry!
The quintessential dish that most people will always order when at Thai eateries is the Stir Fried Minced Pork with Basil Leaves ($11.90). The Thai people always have the magical ability to whip up dishes that go so well with rice. ParaThai\'s version of this dish is very similar to what you can get at other places but with added spice. For non-spicy eaters, you can request to adjust the spiciness level too.
The whiff of Pandan fragrance and how good it tastes got me sold. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
Really love the combo of roasted duck and curry! It was very flavourful with a nice touch of sweetness from the grapes. Though it could be a bit spicier but I guess it\'s a good option for those that are afraid of spicy food. This goes very well with the pandan rice! #burpple #eatup
Roast Duck in Red Curry with Pineapple. Was said that this dish is rarely found in Singapore and is only usually served in upscale restaurants in Thailand. Red Curry was pretty thick with coconut milk fragrance, with a slight tinge of sweetness from the pineapple which was pretty delicious despite being very flavourful. No chance on the duck though; by the time I landed my spoon in here all the roasted duck meat were all gone :(
I always like my rice Lemak; this Pandan rice is just wafting with Pandan flavours so much and goes really well with Tom Yum Goong soup!
A unique Thai-Chinese fusion dish which has pineapple cubes and grapes added, along with more than 15 herbs and spices. First try at this got me liking how good and different it tasted. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
The one dish that is truly unique to ParaThai is the Roast Duck in Red Curry with Pineapple (Geang Phed Ped Yang, $14.90). Not commonly found in Thai restaurants, their rendition of this curry goes well with rice. However, I would change the roast duck with fish/chicken and it will be a perfect one-dish meal.
This bowl of goodness consists of the important traits of a tom yum soup; spicy and sour which tasted quite decent. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
Spicy and tangy. That\'s how I like my tom yum to taste. The Tom Yum Soup with Sea Prawns ($7.90 per bowl/$19.90 per firepot) from ParaThai is a cauldron of goodness that packs a punch. A classic that always makes it to the menu at every Thai restaurant. 
Starting with appetisers, try the mildly sweet Kway Teow Song Kreang ($6.90) - rice noodles stuffed with homemade minced pork and preserved turnip. 
Basically something like Vietnamese spring rolls with a little spice! (Trying out a new non filter style!)
Essentially popiah, but now meaty, moist and juicy (that is quite literally foodporn, you dirty perv - Editor). 3.4/5
Rice noodle wrap is extremely thin yet chewy, unveiling minced pork packed with nuts for extra crunchiness. Simple yet delicious.  Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/05/media-tasting-parathai.html?m=0
Loved this appetizer that kickstarted the #burpple #eatup The mix of minced pork and cai por wrapped in a rice noodle skin and with a lettuce on the exterior was very refreshing! The Cai por added a very nice sweetness to the savoury pork!
Minced Pork in Rice Noodle Wrap. Think of it as the Thai version of the Vietnamese Rice Rolls. It\'s mildly sweet as the marination of the meat is somewhat similar to the Basil Minced Pork, but less the spiciness. Lettuce beneath and other greens adds a healthy freshness to the dish so it feels really light and opens the appetite as a starter.
The first dish of last night\'s Burpple Eatup was an appetizer of Homemade Minced Pork in Rice Noodle Wrap (Kway Teow Song Kreang, $6.90). Was informed that the chef specially imports the rice noodle wrap from Thailand to retain the same texture when eating here. Each bite-sized wrap was seated on a bed of lettuce and sprinkled with coriander leaves and fried garlic to give an additional crunch and burst of flavour. Hong Kong Chee Cheong Fun and Vietnamese Spring Rolls come to mind upon eating them together.
We were greeted with a glass of Lemongrass drink or Thai Iced Tea for the start of our Burpple Eatup at ParaThai yesterday. Located at the newly opened OneKM shopping mall (Nearest MRT: Paya Lebar), ParaThai is the first Thai restaurant venture by the Paradise Group. Helmed by Chef Maew and his team, there is an offering of over 80 authentic and quality Thai dishes, according to the restaurant. However, after the eatup, I felt that the dishes were made more fusion to cater to the Asian palates than authentic Thai. My Thai Iced Tea tasted like caramel macchiato (maybe due to the gula melaka), without the distinct Thai milk tea taste and fragrance.
Gai Phad Bai Kra Prow (Stir Fried Minced Chicken or Pork with Basil Leaves $11.90) is one of the meat dishes that are executed well at ParaThai. I certainly enjoyed this dish except that the spiciness was a little overwhelming for me. 
A Thai meal cannot be complete without the classic Tom Yam Goong - Tom Yum Soup with Sea Prawns ($7.90 per bowl). Perfecting a great balance of being spicy, sweet and sour all at once, this soup broth is flavourful and packs a powerful punch. The Tom Yam Goong can be also served in a firepot ($19.90) which is good for sharing 3 to 4 persons. 
In the meat and poultry section, you will be surprised to find a selection of beef dishes at ParaThai, as most Thai restaurants usually serve only pork, chicken or duck. Suer Rong Hai (BBQ Beef Steak with homemade sauce $16.90) is one of the signature and must-try dishes of ParaThai. The dish bears a special nickname - \"Crying Tiger\" which hides an unique storyline behind its name and recipe. 
Unfortunately, the fish looked pretty flat and I would prefer that the chefs prop up the head of the fish by placing some ingredients below. The gravy was uniquely Thai, with lots of lime and spices. Try this in your next reunion gathering, perhaps?
Thick slices of otak-otak with spicy flavors and a hint of sweetness. These comes in four bowls and the recommended sharing portion is for two. I had such fun digging out the meat! Available at S$10.90
S$7.90 | Tucking into this bowl of Tom Yum soup, I felt like a bomb went off in my throat. It was SUPER shiok (Singaporean slang for extremely delicious)! I have never been fond of sour foods, but this was somehow refreshingly tasty. An entire prawn was dunked in the soup (complete with head and shell) and the juices made the soup a wholesomely appetising one.
Managed to order in some Thai cuisine from ParaThai with the Deliveroo app halfway during my singing lesson which was such a convenience! - (In case you\'re wondering, ParaThai is opened by Paradise group, hence the uncanny resemblance in the name) -\n<br />I got myself the very filling Black Olive Fried Rice with Chicken ($12.73), which had a bit of wok hei and sweet taste from black carrot cake and the \"can\'t-go-wrong\" Traditional Thai Green Curry Chicken ($10.59). Of course, what\'s a Thai meal without a serving of Mango Sticky Rice and Coconut Milk ($7.38)? Perfect comfort food to spice up your day. (Weird pricing is due to the factoring in of GST) -\n<br />From 18th - 24th July, Deliveroo will be having \"Thai Week\" where you can get set meals for 2 pax for $25, 4 pax for $45 sets.

Normal Tom yum soup. \n<br />Not too bad.  Could be better.
Rather normal but one of the popular dishes there.
Doesn\'t make the mark for the traditional thai otah.
Kinda like the taste of this. Not too bad!

Kway Teow Song Kreang ($6.90) is light and refreshing to the palate, perfect for a one-mouth appetizer. The homemade minced pork in rice noodle wrap is somewhat similar to a Vietnamese spring roll but done Thai style.

The soup was especially fiery when piping hot. And best sipped on and savoured at the end when it\'s thickened. Worth the trip.üòã‚ú®üòÄ
