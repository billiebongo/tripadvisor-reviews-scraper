Dessert station comes with a wide variety of pastries from homemade cookies, cakes, waffles, gelato. They do have a cheese section for the cheese lovers!
A new dish that is added to the buffet line is the drunken prawns. The waiter will pour the rice wine over the fresh prawns and cook them a la minute. It was undeniably delicious.
I start and end my buffet meals with cheese and bubbly, both of which are stellar at Melt. Do not miss their wagyu shabu and Indian food! #mofoodies
Chef was nice enough to give me more lobsters when I asked if I can have more. üòç. He took some and dip in the hot laksa gravy pot and put it on top of my bowl. #MeltFoodies
Where else can you find Beef Shabu Shabu or Cheese Naan done a la minute? More on Snapchat @msskinnyfat #meltfoodies
#MeltCafe has also done away with waffles. Instead, they now offer a la minute, divinely scented crepes that marries perfectly with their compact range of tasty ice creams and sorbet - loved the lychee sorbet. \n<br />#MOments #MOFoodies #MOSingapore #MeltFoodies
It\'s brighter, more sleek and just feels roomier now.
We were seated near the dessert section. The dessert chef was preparing the waffles. You can smell the aroma from the waffles from far away. The chocolate ice cream is very rich and good. Superb. 
You got to try this. Very superb mushroom soup and very good garlic bread to accompany it. Really superb beyond words. 
We were given this complimentary cake in celebration of my parents\' wedding anniversary. Really nice of Melt. Thank you very much. 
Many sifferent kinds of stews from all around the world. I like the oxtail stew. The oxtail can be seen in the picture. Very tender and beefy. If you like beef you got to try it. 
This is the best part of the buffet. Selection of indian curries that are really nice. Especially the fish curry which is the one of the best i have tried in singapore. There is also tandoori selection. The tandoori fish is superb as well. 
Different kinds of cheese, salami, salads and more. Thai mango and papaya salad too. 
I prefer certain buffets in Singapore because they offer a couple of unique highlights that sit well with me. At Melt The World Cafe located on the 4th level of the Mandarin Oriental, besides the freshly-made Belgian waffles, it is the cold and cooked seafood as well as the Indian cuisine selections that I am drawn to most.\n<br />When we were there recently, I had the pleasure of starting off with a chilled assortment of crabs, prawns, crayfish, mussels and clams. My favourite was the Alaskan King Crab legs as the meat was plentiful, very sweet and juicy. After that, I moved on to attack the BBQ section with its hot-off-the-grill seafood and steak. The smoky aroma was tantalising to say the least.\n<br />The third highlight for me was the Indian cuisine section where amazing deliciousness took the form of curries, dals, different types of tandoori, naans, briyani rice, mindblowing chutneys and crackers. \n<br />There\'s plenty of other food to love here (like the laksa for instance) but in terms of priority, the ones stated above were what I chose to allocate more tummy space for. \n
There are two main highlights for me at Melt The World Cafe\'s buffet, with the waffles from the dessert section being one of them. Made fresh on the spot, they are terrifically fragrant and lightly crunchy. I also find that if you ask the staff on duty to warm the waffles up a second time in the waffle-maker, it gets them slightly crunchier. What I love most is the mind-boggling array of toppings available. From ice-creams to pats of butter, vanilla bean sauce to chantilly cream, maple syrup to honey, assorted jams and preserves to Nutella, mini crispy chocolate balls to warm, liquid chocolate from the ever-flowing fountain, there\'s so much to play with. Combine them in any permutation and you\'re bound to get divinely delicious results! 
Doesn\'t this donut-shaped #Christmas Snow White of roasted pistachio genoa, strawberry compote, apple confit and cream cheese Normandy mousse remind you of Frozen\'s Elsa?\n<br />#MOSingapore \n<br />Let it go, let it go~~
We were having the \'Traditional Christmas Red Velvet Fruit Cake\' from Mandarin Oriental Singapore for supper! It\'s a pound cake topped with Christmas spices, butter cream and candied orange. (300gm for $26 / 600 gm for $50) Available from 30 Nov. It\'s 49 days to Christmas! I really like the candied orange with the cake!
but we didnt manage to hit our target of 80 prawns:/ #melttheworld üç¥#burpple
Try out the super dessert bar which came along with the international buffet. Worth it with Fresh seafood, sashimi, and other special dishes.
One of the better international buffet dinners in Singapore - must-try stations include Indian cuisine, barbecue seafood and meat (satays, lamb chop), cold seafood and soft fluffy Belgium waffles with ice cream

Lives up to its name!
If it\'s one hotel buffet that is return just for its Indian selection, it would be Mandarin Oriental Singapore. So boy am I glad to hear that they\'re having a \'Go India\' feast from 6-15 Mar that features some of their Indian chef\'s bests.
If u are looking for a buffet place to celebrate this Christmas, check out DanielFoodDiary.com for my personal Top 5 Hotel International buffet. This is the Royal Tandoori from MELT, love the masala prawns. http://danielfooddiary.com/2013/12/10/buffets-singapore/
Many companies seem to be in the mood for buffets during December. Always a happy month. Trying out MELT with its huge variety of desserts. And the very first thing I eat is, the Waffles.
Oh-so pretty Hazelnut Royaltine with mini iconic @MO_Singapore fans! Yums
Business lunch, could only snap the food pics secretly when I was away from the table! They have pretty decent Indian, Japanese and Mediterranean food stations, and a very delectable Dessert Area, with very eager dessert chefs who kept suggesting I try this and that! Haha...not bad! Staff was polite and eas greeted several times as i pranced ard the cafe. Will be back soon!
This dish is available on the dim sum brunch menu.

Yam custard was not overly sweet or starchy. I ate all 3 cos its that yummilicious. And it is in my favorite purple color. Love it!!\n<br />Thank you Razel at cherrygarden @mo_singapore for so kindly allowing me to snap my takeaway at the restaurant. Great service.\n<br />#buns #dimsum #snacks #burpple #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgfoodies #bloggersg #igers #stfoodtrending #mandarinorientalsg #chopesg
Thank you again for the fabulous time! PS. Indian fare is so good; Cheese Naan a must-try.
The new Melt Caf√© still has very good Indian food. I can just eat this with the various Indian pickles! #MeltFoodies

This buffet is widely known for its desserts and it is truely so. Didnt try much as i was too full from the super huge spread of food. Tried some though. The english minced fruit pie is really good. 
Fresh oysters, crabs, lobsters and others. Comes with salsas that are freshly made. 
Several kinds of sushi at the sushi counter. The maki with tempura prawn is the best. There are scallop sushis as well. 
THANKSGIVING Two-tone truffle roasted whole turkey! The meat is so soft and tender, plus the giblet gravy that comes with it is delicious! üò∏. I hear Christmas ringing around the corners ~~ wohooo \n<br />#food #foodpornasia #foodstamping #foodgasm #foodpics #foodspotting #foodiesg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgig #instagood #instasg #igfoodies #igsg #whati8today #icapturefood #burpple #hungrygowhere #roast #turkey #mandarinoriental #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #sgrestaurant #fooddiary #foodgawker #foodstyling

Strangely, the Balinese food wasn\'t very impressive, but the Indian dishes and desserts were pretty darn good! :) wouldn\'t mind returning.
Just bend to break and the voila, perfect for eating :)
Go for the iconic Bebek Betutu (Roast Duck in Banana Leaf) and Babi Guling (Suckling Pig). And how can we say no to MELT\'s fantastic Indian spread?
good. *passes out*
