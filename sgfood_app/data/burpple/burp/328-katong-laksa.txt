Taking a break from my ban Mian hunt and decided to indulge myself with one of my favorite local dishes at Katong. What I love so much about it is its strong coconut flavour and the fragrant hei bee hiam that can be added onto the already yummy soup base. Top up with an Otah and you have for yourself a guilty but satisfying treat!
My first try on Katong Laksa! The soup is so delicious! Try their Otak too! Yummy 😋
It\'s singapore delight - Katong Laksa🍜 Some thing spicy for #mondayblues.  #burpple #328katonglaksa
Seems abit more watery than usual, think too much people.
Because comfort food is still the best, especially when you are on East Coast Rd. Every scoop is filled with small chopped dry prawn. And you know that the soup is the best. Paired the laksa with otah, and finish it off with line juice. I am sold. 
#1: a must eat for tourists who have been eating fake Singaporean noodles their whole lives in other countries. To make them extra interested in this dish you can always throw out Gordon Ramsay\'s name and explain how shiok it is. This dish comes at $4.50, $5.50, $6.50 per bowl and you can always add otak and order a glass of kopi for them. Ways to recommend go there can be very complicated; for me: I take bus 13 from Eunos Mrt, alight 3 stops after at still road, cross the road to East coast road and make the 10 minutes walk to the main branch which opens from 8am to 10pm. During the walk you can even be a tour guide and introduce the churches, peranekan food places, awfully chocolate.. And so much more!
Laksa is the dish I crave most when I have been away for a while. It is also the most requested dish by friends visiting from overseas. I like coming to the main branch of the famous 328 Katong Laksa because it never disappoints. Everything that makes a laksa so incredibly tasty is down to a science here. The otak is also pretty good.
In the eastern hood of Singapore, which is really foodie land. This is somehow known as the \"Gordon Ramsay\" Laksa. Auntie is upset because we ordered laksa just about she is closing.
Katong laksa for lunch today. Quite generous with the ingredients, loads of hum and prawns.
The real deal. Enough said. 
Earlier today; my cravings have been satisfied! #whitagram #burpple
This is an addiction. And it is always best to be accompanied with the Otah and pair it up with a Barley drink so it wont be so \'heaty\'. Tip: ask for a pair of chopsticks if you\'re aren\'t comfortable with just using the spoon. 🍜 
More bowls of \"sunshine\" for the grey day. I\'m not complaining! | #laksa #streetfood #food
Ocassionally I have cravings for Laksa and this is the place I go. The Otah goes very well with the signature Katong Laksa. But I do think that blend is getting a little bland these days. Maybe it\'s just me.
Late night laksa after a crazy day spent running around. #supper #sinfulpleasures
Laksa x large + extra cockles. So that\'s all my cravings solved for the week. And yes i finished every bit of the gravy too :
we love it’s delicious and aromatic coconut based curry with coconut milk, chilli, fried shrimps and herbs. The banana leaf otah is a perfect side dish to compliment the laksa too. 💕 For spicy lovers, you may also add in another pack of chilli sauce to spice up your laksa to the next level of spiciness, it actually brings out more flavourful curry taste! ❤️ Yumsss! #328katonglaksa #328katong #katonglaksa #katonglaksa328 #laksa #Katong
Generous shrimp and fish slices, the trek out East is so worth it. Oh and did I mention, this place is famous for beating @gordongram in a laksa cookoff?\n<br />—\n<br />//📸: Katong Laksa (S$5)\n<br />📍🇸🇬\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#eatfamous #buzzfeedfood #foodporn #feedyoursoull #eeeeeats #beautifulcuisines #spoonfeed #foodstagram #eatingfortheinsta #instafood #foodphotography #foodgasm #getinmybelly #f52grams #foodie #sgfoodie #vancouverfoodie #好食 #onthetable #lovefood #相機食先 #먹스타그램 #맛있다 #burpple #laksa #noodle #singaporefood #sgeats

One of the BEST Laksa - 328 Katong Laksa! Slurp down your throat with these pipping hot and spicy laksa.... Perfect meal for such a cold cosy weather! @phusionade #katong #katonglaksa #laksa #bestlaksa #328katonglaksa #328katonglaksasg
Paired with the smooth white noodles that glides down your throat and the gooey pinkish clams that invite polarized opinions, this local delight remains an all time favourite and should be one of the top few options on your list when you are in Katong area

Happened to be at Katong today... And made a hasty deployment to the shop. I am so surprised that the prices has rose up over the years. This small bowl version is $5.00 and the larger bowl is $7.00. Nevertheless, the creamy yummy laksa taste remains unchanged. \n<br />#katonglaksa328 #katonglaksa #328katonglaksa #foodhunt #foodstagram #foodiegram #noodles #local #eatsg #jiakbahliao #puikiajiak #eatalone #localdelight #musteatsg #burpple

Added more chilli to the laksa for more kick. Nasilemak is ordinary. Somehow i find the standard has changed. My hunt for really good old traditional laksa \"eat using chopsticks\" continues👠 #laksa #nasilemak #ricelovers #noodles #noodlelovers #sgfoodie #singaporefood #burpple #openricesg #traditional
Best Laksa I\'ve ever taste 👌. The small bowl is just enough for S$5 only. The taste was an authentic. I pair it with my favorite Luohan Longan tea.

I don\'t know if your taste changes with age. I do feel there is considerable difference from I last tasted it many yeara ago. The gravy is lacking the frangrance of dried shrimps hmm...
#burpple
👍🏻👍🏻 laksa in the east 👍🏻👍🏻
Everybody knows about the infamous Katong laksa wars but we still stick by our favourite, 328 Katong Laksa ($5/7). The brand has won numerous awards and achievements including beating Gordon Ramsay at the Hawker Heroes showdown two years ago. If laksa wasn\'t packed with calories, we would be indulging bowl after bowl.

They renovated the place, now it\'s fully air conditioned. It tastes a little differently than I last remembered but still super shiok.
Laksa for dinner 👏👏👏
Small bowl $5 and it is so full :)

Yummy laksa. 😋
Finally here.
As delicious as I remember it growing up. The famous 328 Katong Laksa is still my favourite. Not too milky and packed with flavour from the prawn and chilli paste. The Otah is a good compliment and is sold by the same stall. Add extra chilli for more kick.
