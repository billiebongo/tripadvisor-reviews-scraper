Thought I would order something different. Mentaiko fries, cappuccino and iced long black. Really love how perfectly fried the fries are and the mentaiko dip is so yummy!!!
Easily the best dish of the lot. Warm, oozey baked eggs over a bed of mushrooms &amp; bacon
Patty was soft and delicious. Definitely worth to try the grub burger.
The GRUB cheeseburger and fries delivered on a tray is so photogenic! The pickle perched atop the bun is such a cute idea. Taste-wise, the burger was decent, though not exceptionally impressive. Based on the description on the menu, the beef patty was from 100% grass-fed and free-range beef. The beef was slightly bland, a little underseasoned. I had to add mentaiko sauce to bump up the taste. Crispy hot fries dipped in savoury fishy mentaiko is the best thing ever! 
I will recommend the burger instead of pasta. 
Was very very satisfied by staffs warm and cheerful services experience throughout. It\'s really heartwarming that made our family brunch complete. Good prawn paste fried chicken burger. Need to add sauce for me
The aircon area was full so we dine outside, but it wasn\'t as bad as we thought. The weather was good, the food is good and I have a great companion! The fries is a must try! The fish burger is also recommended 😊 \n<br />Total Damage: $51.90\n<br />Rating: 7/10
Came here because of the mentaiko fries and the Sakura Ebi pasta. The fries was really good but the pasta was alittle disappointing. The truffle mushroom egg was good!  We wanted to eat the dessert which looks appetising but in the end due to the flies we left earlier than expected. We sat indoor and were horrified by the flies then flies around us and the food😣
清明, the yearly affair of paying respects to my grandparents at 光明山, but not before dropping by Grub which is just at the opposite Bishan Park for brunch.\n<br />The prawn paste richness of the Har Cheong Gai burger is in the golden brown batter. Strip it off, and not only will you see the intact chicken (thigh?) portion, you might also get aroused at the oozing thin fat atop that probably keeps the meat succulent. With the addition of mentaiko mayo to sauce up the fries, a cool Happy Shandy (beer with yuzu soda), this is looking to be a pleasant weekend. 
After lunch at Grub Cafe, we had a passion fruit tofu cheesecake. The cheesecake was very refreshing and nice after lunch. It is not very sweet and had a little tinge of sourness.
I love how GRUB takes a simple, thin cut of grass-fed beef and transforms it into something so memorable. Cooked to a tender perfection, the beef goes well with the generous lather of tangy mustard cream sauce atop a bed of sweet, caramalised onions. This is the perfect quick fix at $19 if you\'re craving for steak after a good workout at the park. 
Among everything in the plate, grilled focaccia was the most awesome! Eggs were slightly bland. Side salad, mushrooms and the sausage were just nice. Had mocha for drink, loved how the chocolate and coffee taste blended so well together.
So many guys are sporting man-buns recently. Some looks good, some ok, some please snip it off. For the rest of us, just eat this bun.
(Schneider Weisse - So light, so tasty)

🍝🍤It\'s linguine with crispy Sakura ebi and succulent prawns with hint of mentaiko. I feel like I\'m eating aglio olio lei.. Too dry.. Maybe they need to be more generous with the mentaiko. $17 for this like not very worth.

Fresh hot cup of churros that was so crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside + coated with sugar for a sweet treat! Comes with dark chocolate and english cream for extra flavor, though it\'s already pretty darn good on its own. \n<br />On a side note, I still think Korea\'s churros are better, though this is really, really not bad. 😌\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
GRUB Double Cheeseburger - Extremely juicy and tender beef patty with melted Monterey Jack cheese topped up with bacons and other delectable ingredients that made the whole burger extremely messy and so sinfully delicious. \n<br />Mentaiko Fries - Woah, love the addictive mentaiko aioli and fries combination. The seaweed that was paired on top of the fries made the whole combination even more palatable and yummy. Definitely worth ordering since this is one of their signature food over here as well! 😁
I love everything about Grub, the food and the atmosphere. Although the place is quite a bother to search, the food is worth the trip. Soft Shell Chilli Crab Pasta ($18), Salted Egg Wing ($8.50) and Mentaiko Fries ($9) were amazing! 
Nice crispy fries and savory mentaiko sauce! Priced at $9. Great service, food was served almost immediately after we ordered 
Strongly recommend to try this dish when you visit GRUB. Do remember to make a reservation before you go there for dinner!
I like the bun , it\'s soft and fluffy, but the beef is over-cooked 
GRUB bistro, nestled in the middle of Bishan park is a standalone building amidst the lush greenery.The idyllic and scenic backdrop sets the stage for a much needed respite from the bustling city. We ordered Mentaiko fries to start us off. Luscious creamy mentaiko aioli with salty notes and bits of nori seaweed dressing those beautifully browned fries- this is a MUST TRY!
Sous vide pork w grilled pineapples on top of fresh tomato and lettuce and between buttered burger buns. Sounds nice? But the pork was meh. It tasted like they just boiled it with no seasoning or whatsoever.  
Not too bad but the mayo was a tad too strong that kinda masked the mentaiko taste. Cafe latte wasn\'t too shabby! ☺️
This cheeseburger is very worth it . For a person like me who doesnt like ketchup and tomatoes ,every bite is being savoured 😊👌
Honestly its abit of a turn off but nevertheless , the egg could be improved 
Great mentaiko fries and chicken steak!! Churros was nothing fantastic. Could\'ve been better if there was more and thicker dark chocolate sauce! 
🍔\n<br />Not a fan of burgers but read what I have to say about this and more on my blog! (Link in profile.)
Apparently FIX\'s desserts is also now available at GRUB. Hadn\'t got the chance to try this item till today and was blown away with how it tasted. Coconut mousse that sat atop everything else was pretty light and refreshing with coconut flavours was lifted with a hint of milk chocolate sweetness, while Passionfruit gave a tart flavour which went well with the bright Mango flavour which was sweet. Chiffon Cake wasn\'t too try, nor too moist either. A must try!
Salted Egg may be the main star here, but somehow it takes the backseat in GRUB\'s version, where the sauce was seemingly muted. However, there was still a tinge of savouriness that was pretty much akin to prawn-paste chicken in the marination of the meat, which was juicy and tender. Skin was crisp, but somewhat short of the optimal crispiness that would have made that extra oomph to make it memorable.
First ever time had a lunch with moritz beer ! What a cool afternoon ! Lovely ambience ~ 
Cmon you know you want some.\n<br />Who can resist a chocolate dipped Churros 😆😆😋\n<br />Monster Rawr~\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Here\'s more Grub!
Fries with seaweed and mentaiko mayo. Very rich and salty. Good for sharing but our fries tasted stale. Like they fried it some time ago and warm it up.
A delish delight from GRUB. Spicy Chilli crab meat with 2 big wholesome eggs. A little spicy with crab meat chunks but the flavor definitely went well with eggs and toasted bread sticks. 
Looks interesting, and for people. who wants \"value for money\" this ought to be a good choice. However, the fish wasn\'t as tasty on its own (tartare sauce was served aside). Need some sauce to go with it
Oh my goodness! It was served hot with mentaiko sauce! A little bit salty but worth the try! 😍
TGIF!
Had the pork steak burger and portobello burger. Portion was rather tiny! The fries stole the show with their addictive flavor, though it was possibly due to the fact that they were a tad salty | 🌟🌟🌟
Super crispy Churros that were generously sprinkled with sugar. Not sure if they were supposed to be this dense, but I enjoyed it nonetheless! Comes with a creme anglaise and chocolate sauce on the side | 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Every other table was ordering the chilli soft shell crab pasta but I insisted on having this because the combination of fried Sakura ebi and mentaiko was too tempting, and it turned out to be the right choice. While I\'d expected this dish to be typically creamy because of mentaiko, it turned out to be aglio-olio styled linguine topped with mentaiko paste instead. The mentaiko flavor was very subtle as it was overpowered by the irresistible fragrance of crispy fried ebi and garlic bits, but it didn\'t really matter; it was still delicious :)
I would come back to Grub again for 2 reasons: the laid back atmosphere of dining outdoors within the greenery of bishan park, and THIS, a perfect combination of runny yolks, bacon, truffle, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms! I do wish for more truffle to make it all the more umami, but for its price, I shouldn\'t complain. At just $9, this has to be the most value-for-money pair of eggs I\'ve paid for since the brunch frenzy kicked off in SG. 
Honestly quite a disappointment. Tasted just like bolognese I don\'t know what I was expecting. No obvious sign of cheese, I didn\'t like the salad either, made it a little soggy.
Really don\'t understand the hype. This was just average and their Churros were such a let down #anotheroverratedcafe
Are you a fan of mentai? I\'m! So I love these fries!! 
Savoury sweet but the toast is too soaked with maple syrup. Hmm... Won\'t go back for it. 
🐽 So far still the best pork belly I\'ve ever eaten!
Good interior, good food, reasonable pricing. Would come back here again for the food
This is a definite must try item. The pork steak is really tender and juicy, coupled with pineapple and soft bun, perfect!
Have never explored this part of Bishan before, so it was a pleasant surprise to find GRUB in the middle of Bishan Park. While not very accessible, the place was crowded during brunch time on a Sunday afternoon. Opted for the breakfast set with pork sausage (+$1.50) and Liberty coffee (+$3.50). My friend ordered the fish burger, which looks pretty delish too. Overall pretty decent food and chill-out place. The upside is you can take a stroll in Bishan Park to burn off some of the calories from the food! 
Ordered based on other Tastemakers\' recommendation. Works like magic! 
Mentaiko Fries were great. Chicken was soso but the steak was done perfectly. Queue was pretty long and they dont take reservations.
Thinking of having a meal with a different view? Grub is a place one should try. My friend and I ordered the Sakura Ebi Pasta, cooked al-denté with freckles of dried ebi and fresh prawns; the recommended Mentaiko fries, which is pretty good except that the fries could be less salty since the dip is full-flavoured; the slow cooked pork belly with sweet potato and braised leeks - really soft and succulent meat paired with creamy sweetness from the purple potato, but the gravy from the leeks could do with a little less salt. We also ordered the churros, which was thick and huge and paired with white + dark chocolate, though I would prefer more cinnamon flavour in my opinion. The service staff were friendly, and even asked us for feedback about the food and took our comments wholeheartedly. 👍 Willing to give this place another go sometime soon. 
All in one word: Awesome. I really love the dish of slow cooked pork belly. It\'s really really good, and what\'s more when they have purple sweet potato mash (my fav!). That night was purely purrrrfect. 
Haha! #valueformoney #burger with good quality ingredients in a toasted bun. Will be back!
I had the pork steak burger as it was too late and most stuff were sold out. But boy, I wasn\'t disappointed. The burger buns were toasted, and are a little crispy on the inside. The pineapple slice complements the pork steak, heightening the meaty taste. The pork steak is cooked to perfection and it\'s very tender. You don\'t even need a knife! It cuts like butter. Ambience is great but do take note of the closing hours. If only Grub is open till late night! Will definitely be back. Affordable prices ($19 before tax) for awesome food. Worth every cent. 
TGIF !! Finally tried this addictive mentaiko fries ! One good reason to travel all the way there 😜😄 how\'s ur Friday ? Mine was a mixture of fun and having feelings of being duped . Never mind the wkend is here !
There aren\'t many places like Grub, where you\'re able to satisfy your craving for great fish, chicken or pork burgers. The Crispy Fish Burger ($12) has a satisfying crunch, while the Pork Steak Burger ($13) surprises with tender, sous-vide meat. Can\'t decide? Go for the Chicken Thigh Burger ($12) with fried enoki mushrooms and kaffir-lime mayo! Because you shouldn\'t leave without trying their Mentaiko Fries, change the fries that come with your burger to a salad or mash. Perfect for a lighter meal, order these non-beef choices for a nice brunch in the park!
Simple but delightful! Pasta was cooked just nicely, and drizzle with mentaiko, it not dry at all. Drenched with Sakura ebi, each bite is just bursting and delicious. A must go for a different locations and ambience, for it\'s right on Bishan Park. || Price: S$17
I thought maybe I should have something different so I ordered their Sakura ebi linguine. I think it\'s a pity because they didn\'t serve my dish immediately when it\'s hot, so all my linguine stick together, they had a confusion I believe which caused my food to go round and round but not our table. So whatever it is, the generous amount of Sakura prawn that is in my linguine was wow I swear. The linguine was very well cooked and I would definitely go back for more. Since it was scorching hot that day, i had their ice honey lime juice, it was really really refreshing especially during a hot day. Despite the fact that grub is really hard to locate I think it\'s always worth the trip. :) 
Cheeseburgers were always my childhood fav. They serve tasty fuss-free hot and juicy cheeseburger here. Nice!!! Patty came medium well, just the way I like it. I love gherkins in my cheeseburger so that little little one that came on the side was a wet blanket but still, better than none, right? Can u see the cheese hanging off the side, well, that\'s just how fast it came from kitchen. (Oh! Maybe that\'s why my burger bun looked so manhandled?! Lol!) No fingerprints so no biggie. I did enjoy my meal. Burger prices are $14 on average, including a side of fries.
No human congestion or queue cutting with their iPad around to get your table. Simple questions in big sized fonts leads to the SMS in the picture. The MACHINE will call to inform, if u change your mind, hang up. IF u are still hard up for a table like me, press 1 and proceed to the restaurant. So tech savvy!!! I like!!! 
Meet my new blond friend (only beer on tap, $8). Considering the continuous flow of diners, it came really chilled. Went so well with my burger. We had a good time here. Service was prompt, food came fast and hot, prices reasonable and parking just a stone\'s throw away if u parked behind the restaurant (come in through Thomson/Marymount). ♪(´ε｀ ) 
Have you ever seen a fish fillet that is bigger than the bun itself? This is more like fish and chips than a Crispy Fish Burger. Oh and I added Monterey Jack Cheese to my burger, which in my opinion doesn\'t make much of a difference.
You can get this yummy French toast for just $12! For those who love sweet and savory 😋
(Side order the mentaiko sauce for our fries; shiok)\n<br />The burger was too good, too shiok we had to try another one and we decided on GRUB cheeseburger. The pork burger was definitely a million times better!! // Belgium waffle has to be eaten on the spot or it turns soggy quite fast along side with the gelato // Didn\'t quite like their French toast but the sausage made up to it
Crispy fish burger was great! Portion was huge, but the fish was a little overcooked. Great dish nonetheless.
$15 for a huge portion of fried fish in the burger. Taste good with tartar sauce and chilli. Additional $3 for the portabello sure enhances the taste! 👍 
Since it\'s located in Bishan Park, you can\'t deny that this cafe has a really good ambience (apart from the mosquito and insect landing on your table sometimes) but it\'s definitely a great place to have gathering because they served food with the correct portion in the most reasonable prices. I ordered a chicken thigh burger while Eunice ordered a grilled steak &amp; fries. We add on $2 for their mentaiko sauce wondering what is that, and churros for dessert! The chicken thigh burger had this really special taste, it comes with kaffir like mayo sauce which tasted a little like green curry (?) and the fried enoki in the burger goes pretty well with the fluffy bread. The steak that Eunice had was pretty well cooked, their mustard sauce doesn\'t taste like the normal mustard and the both of us liked it very much. The mentaiko sauce is a little salty for me though. The churros comes with dark chocolate sauce and creme anglaise. The churros were soft in the inside and the dark chocolate sauce was my favorite. It goes perfectly well with the sugar coated churros giving that butter sweet taste. Their home made draft beer was pretty good, it didn\'t leave that bitter taste after you drink it, which is my kind of beer actually. Great dinner. 
A place with a very laidback atmosphere to chill and enjoy Grub\'s food. The cheeseburger is such a delight, with its full patty and it has also fries to go along with it. A hard place to find in Ang Mo Kio park, but worthwhile to make a trip to.
Crispy fish with a huge portion of fries. Love the great ambience and good food &amp; service. However it\'s a little inaccessible 
Inch by inch they\'d shrink in size until all that remained was the cinammon sugar shower... LOVELY!
Love the mentaiko fries, the sauce was just mmhmm and the fries were really well fried. Hehe. The pork belly although not recommended by the staff was pretty outstanding considering that I do not like pork belly. The mash sweet potato that came along with the pork belly was also pretty refreshing as well 👍👍 worth every penny. The grub cheeseburger did not fair as well considering it was one of the signature dishes, would not say it\'s not nice but it didn\'t stand out from the other burgers I\'ve had. Needless to say, the churros was good, served together with vanilla and dark chocolate sauce. Yummy. But carol found the dark chocolate too strong and masking the original taste of the churros. 
Quiet place to chill. Burgers was decent. Mentaiko fries are to die for here! 
They r located at bishan amk park.. surrounded by lush greenery!  I like the park itself!  Anyway.. I shared this Burger with a gal friend.  It is served with fries.. Burger ($18) itself is juicy and yummy!  We added a slice of portobello mushroom to it. Do come early if u want a table inside( limited tables inside ) or else there are al fresco sitting. May have to que as they don\'t accept reservations. Service was so so and they totally forgotten our mentiko fries,we canceled it after we were done with our meal... not even sure if the Korea staff keyed it into our order.. Oh well..maybe will try it next time.
Love how the fish fillet is bigger than the buns! Ooh yeah #grubsg
Most memorable dish at grub. The fries are really different from most Cafes, it has a distinct potato taste &amp; the mentaiko mayo goes really well with it! 
With all honesty, I\'ve never heard of \'mentaiko\' before. The first time trying Mentaiko fries just made me fall in love with it. Not a fan of fries because I\'m not a potato lover (plus fries reminds me of macdonalds fries which is extremely unhealthy). To add on, I absolutely dislike mayo because I hate anything that is creamy or mayo-y taste (if I\'m right to say that mayo is creamy?). But Mentaiko just made me break this hatred because it\'s mixed with mayo (say whuttt). Okay basically it\'s the sauce that is so addictive that even a person like me will keep craving for it. Bottomline is, Grub has wonderful side dishes. 
It\'s really fish and chips. Finally checked out Grub but I had no tummy space for Churros. :((
Another new and delicious item on the menu at #Grub Bishan Park.
The bf\'s order of a breaded chicken burger with fried enoki and a Thai twist of kaffir lime mayo, pimped with extra parma ham and a fried egg. 
My burger has wings! Well, its very much like eating a fish burger out of Mcdonalds, except that the burger buns are much fresher and taste less artificial...
One long sausage that spurts cheese when you bite into it, topped with beef chili con carne and parmesan cheese. 
A standard sized burger with fries, at $13.90. Food was not bad, which was what I\'d expect from that price. Surprisingly, it was just the right portion.
Flowers to see, flowers to eat. With the lovelies @joeyozy &amp; @afwhye.
Mentaiko Fries. Who cares that the fries aren\'t handcut when the dressing of mentaiko mayo and nori is so frigging fabulous? This is by far my top favourite dish here. #fries #mentaiko #mayo #nori #seafood #foodporn #comfortfood #sgfood #ilovemyjob
GRUB Cheeseburger. Go back to basics with this unfussy number comprising a homemade minced beef chuck patty, melted Monterey Jack cheese, and a pickled gherkin on the side. #beef #burger #cheese #cheeseburger #fries #pickle #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Pork Steak Burger. Perhaps we left it sitting out for too long before digging in, but the pork roulade \"patty\" was too tough and dry by the time I got round to it. But what I did like was the cashew chimichurri on top, which gave the burger a refreshingly Asian taste. #burger #pork #fries #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Crispy Fish Burger. Assembled with crumbed, deep-fried hake, this is essentially a remake of fish &amp; chips with burger buns - evidently a hefty portion. Too bad I found the fish a bit stiff and a little under-seasoned. #fish #hake #burger #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Grilled Chicken Thigh Burger. My pick at this casual cafe would be their chicken burger - the meat, not just the skin, was surprisingly tasty and well-marinated. Fried enoki mushrooms and a dab of creamy peanut butter aioli added a unique, earthy flavour. #chicken #burger #enoki #peanutbutter #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
and the second of de better dish... i loved de crispy but nt oily skin. yummmms
idk if its the many negative reviews that ive heard to cause this lack of anticipation but the food here is really average. HAHA. this pork steak burger is rather enticing to de eyes not bad but the pork could be seasoned more. anyways. a really decent hangout in this breezy weather
To end off a meal... CHURROS!!!! 😁😄 Dark Chocolate as a dip is just 👍👍👍 #burpple

THIS IS THE BEST PORK BELLY I\'VE HAD! Crispy on the outside, tender and succulent on the inside! When eaten together with the mash, the taste was simply divine! The mash is not any ordinary mash, it\'s tangy and and addictive!
GRUB\'s Slow roasted pork belly ($15) with mango sauce, mash and cherry tomato salsa. THIS IS THE BEST PORK BELLY I\'VE HAD! Crispy on the outside, tender and succulent on the inside! When eaten together with the mash, the taste was simply divine! The mash is not any ordinary mash, it\'s tangy and and addictive!
The mentaiko sauce is really good. They would have perfected our experience eating it by providing free refill of the sauce. Great comfort food though a little steeply priced at $9 for the fries.
Enjoyed these crispy fluffy waffles too! The fried bananas and real vanilla gelato makes a wonderful combi. This over churros, anytime!
Slightly runny eggs, truffle oil, Parma ham shavings and toasted focaccia to scoop it all up. Satisfied! ☺☺☺
They uses “responsible ingredients” such as free-range chicken and beef, and avoids MSG, artificial preservatives and additives. Its produce is also mostly from local farms. Here\'s a photo of beef &amp; Guinness pie. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/brunch-at-grub-bishan-park/
good taste, good portion. delish when paired with a beer or cider! :)
Pocket friendly &amp; yummy!
The food was okay.. Edible but not the best. If you ask, I\'d say I wouldn\'t suggest for another visit.. The churro was decent looking but that was all.
grilled chicken leg
GRUB cheeseburger
One of the better dish at grub. Or maybe I\'m biased because almost every dish with truffle enhance the flavour. ;)
Nice crispy roasted pork belly that isn\'t too oily and melts in the mouth! Served with cooked cherry tomatoes, mashed potatoes and a nice mango sauce to it. Tasted pretty unique, definitely a must try at Grub! ($15)
Salmon was great though risotto tasted like porridge...
a rather average tasting dish but I\'m hoping that it\'s only because the head chef isn\'t in on Hari Raya rather than a drop in standard here at Grub.
Salmon was pretty good but their risotto has a lot of room for improvement!
Very yummy I liked it! Cos the chocolate sauce was chilled $8.50?
Casual bistro set in the middle of a beautiful park with lush greenery all around. Here\'s a photo of GRUB Cheeseburger. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/grub-at-bishan-park-casual-bistro-fare/
Doesn\'t sound like much? I\'m usually a beef loving gal and this nearly had me converted. Loved sinking my teeth into the soft flavorful meat and fluffy bun! Def worth a repeat visit.
Always happy to hear about new eateries opening in the north, i enthusiastically pull my gal friends and husband along to check out this rather new cafe at Bishan Park. Went for something different from my usual brunch choices after recommendations from the wait staff and it surely didn\'t disappoint! 
Chilli adds some spicy kick to this delicious dessert! 
Fish Burger! The fried Hake fillet is so fresh and fried so crispy that you couldn\'t stop eating! Paired with the tartar sauce.. Heaven!!
Awesome Pork Belly that are being cooked using Sous Vide! Melts in your mouth goodness! :)
Dinner with @dashtaz and @kaz_52. Here\'s our GRUB Cheeseburger.
Preferred this t the fish burger. Thought i wouldnt like the sauce but surprisingly it blends well w the burger. 
Kinda overrated for us. Great service and reasonable price though. But do be prepared t wait for your table as they dont take reservations yet. 
pretty good! we had a second serving of this! worth the calories!
a tad underwhelming..
tastes pretty okay but worth 7 bucks?
worth the half hour wait?
Somehow, I wasn\'t impressed. Felt that it tasted too doughy; overseas (esp Europe) churros are still the best!
When I ordered \'Chicken Thigh\' I expected something different.

Carbonara was surprisingly good!!! Al dente noodles 🍝 sauce was thick and Not gelat throughout eating. Just look at that egg yolk 🍳 ~ they are also generous in the amount of cheese. It covered the entire plate.
WRONG. the coffee smelled and tasted burnt, it was flat with no other flavours and the first sip was offensive. the apple crumble tart at the back was also pathetic - wet, soggy, and clearly heated up in a microwave before serving. booo. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼

Everything was gud - except the salad, they\'re just being salad. I especially love the toasted ciabatta, it\'s has this crispy outer and soft center. Goes very well with the egg, bacon, sausage and the sauce. 😋

Grub-bing in this cafe in Bishan Park.

Abit disappointing not as nice as expected. 
Delicious and yummy fries! 
The bun taste hard. The crispy fish was alright. The har cheong chicken kinda taste horrible. No prawn paste smell and so much fatssss!

in fact, I was actually contemplating adding on another slice (or two) of the Monterey Jack Cheese but alright, \"thou shalt not be greedy\" 😐 I know the patty looks tough from this photo but in reality, it was perfectly charred on the outside, yet the moment you sink your teeth in, you\'d see how the chefs managed to retain a pinkish inside (medium-rare) and I didn\'t even need to request for that! honest to goodness burger that comes with a side of extra crispy fries and now I wonder if I have I eaten a little too much? 😳
it\'s the perfect one-dish meal for a Saturday brunch and I guarantee your heart will feel as warm and fuzzy as mine after you\'ve had this \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #brunch #breakfast #burpplecafemonth #grubsingapore #grubsg

Lusciously chewy and succulent, it will be an absolute delight for meat lovers. \n<br />You can also choose to top up to have Grub\'s special mentaiko sauce to go with the fries and the greens

#pasta done #aldente with #wildrocket. The taste was balanced and not too salty.
Beautifully done and tasted awesome.. The chicken patty was really juicy and tender and the marinated prawn paste was just right.. This burger really exceeded my expectations.. Worth eating!

Lets just say I am not impressed at all in terms of food quality. We ordered double cheese burger, fish and chips burger, slow braised pork belly, fries and churros. 1)Beef patty in cheese burger were overcooked. Tasted like rubber 2) DO NOT ORDER THE FISH N CHIPS BURGER. Omg the flour coating tasted so bad 😱😱😭😭. 3) Slow braised pork belly and fries kinda save the night as they taste pretty good. 4)Churros tasted meh. In short, the hype got my expectations up high and I am disappointed.
The chilli crab pasta was my favourite, and though the har cheong tai burger was slightly salty, the chicken patty was super tender. Also topped up $2 for the mentaiko dip instead of ordering separate mentaiko fries (because psssst they\'re the same! Thanks to the waiter for saving us some $ 😉) #burpplesg #burpple #ngiamyeats \n<br />#foodporn #foodpics #fatty4life #sgcafefood #exsgcafes #exploresingapore #onthetableproject #onthetable #tablesituation #topdown #whati8today #tflers #tagsforlikes #20likes #grubsg @grubsingapore

Cheeseburger at this cafe along Bishan Park. Enjoyed the generous beef patty. 
This combination is legit 👍🏿
Love this 
This is the 2nd visit and the quality of Churros had dropped.. It\'s too thick and the flour inside is still watery 
So far so good 
Affordable, filling and tasty!!
Churros was too hard the first time I came and so I decided to try this again. Now the inside is too chewy and not fluffy at all. Their sauces are too watery and drips all over the table, especially with the wind. I actually brought my friend some non-baked durian cheesecake and we ended up using that as our churros dip instead. It really saved it.
Such a nice day today to have brunch al fresco. But other than the ambience and drinks, the food here is not great.
Gilled chicken burger. Moist and juicy. 
Nice and refreshing 
$9 for 8 churros which comes with creme anglaise and chocolate sauce at the side. who could resist chocolate dipped churros!
Revisiting a dish that I have had in my previous visit to GRUB. Churros are now dusted with more cinnamon sugar, and comes more crisp without being too hard this time round, though insides still could be worked on so it could be less dry. Still works better with Creme Anglaise, which induces a subtle tartness and sweetness than the chocolate dip which overpowers the cinnamon sugar somehow.
Who knew time alone eating burgers could be therapeutic😯 | #sgfood #igsg #cafesg #grub #burgers #burpple
Grub\'s brunch experience leaves me with a resolution to return again. #grub #cafe #brunch #sgcafe #burger #weekends #burpple
GRUB is one of the places you can get Churros, the delicious Spanish snack. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
Isn\'t the best, or great, or even that good, but the place is a good Sunday, dinner, or chill hangout cafe in the heart of a neighbor. With the backdrop of the Bishan park. This place is definitely here to stay. Not to mention the highly resonable price tag to every dish! Nothing over $18 😍, a definite place to be when you don\'t know what to do. 
Yum! #grubsg #burple #theboodiesrecommends #datenight

Served with dark chocolate sauce, tangy creme anglaise dips. Amazed by how it\'s not sweet at all despite the sugar. It wasn\'t bad but nothing impressive. Would prefer if it\'s crispier &amp; more cinnamon

Took a painfully long 40 minutes to arrive, but the cheeseburger was worth every single penny (although the beef patty looked a little charred). Loved the fries too! ($13++)
I love this so much! I\'ve tried a few times of churros myself and I decided to keep Grub\'s churros in my \'I Love\' list! It came out warm, with the sugar coating outside, and the dips:) I prefer eating the churros without the dips though. Then these churros are slight crispy on the outside and soft/tender on the inside. Typing about this makes me crave for one now! 😋 if you love and is looking for churros, no harm trying this, no regrets! 😄

Crispy on the outside and soft inside..hot and fresh, accompanied by a chocolate sauce and creme anglaise when served.

Mentaiko and fries, awesome combination! 👍 
So, after running X-country with my friends in Bishan Park, we decided to go check out the café that everyone had been raving about. I ordered their cheeseburger (not sure if that\'s the exact name for it), which came with a side of fries. Thankfully, the meal was worth all the money I paid for it. It arrived on a thick tray, and the fries were in a ceramic mug, which I thought was very cute and unique. The burger and fries did not disappoint either. The meat was tender and juicy, the cheese was a delicious complement to the meat, the bread was soft and chewy, and the sauce drizzled on the vegetables made me, a vegetable-hater, enjoy every single bite. The fries were amazing as well. They were not the pathetic, skinny fries you find in Ashton\'s or Mac\'s; they were thick and filled with all that potato goodness, and because they were in a ceramic mug, they stayed warm even until after I finished my burger. There was just the right amount of salt sprinkled on as well. It is safe to say that I\'ll be back soon.
Mentaiko was the best thing ever 
Definitely not disappointing! The dips that came together didn\'t taste good though. But will come back for more if I crave for churros yum yum!! 😋
Doesn\'t get any better than this 😌
$9 for awesome crunchy churros! The sauce and be thicker! But the original taste of the churros is good enough.
😁 #vsco #vscocam #food
Good to share after a hearty burger meal with a group 
My best substitute to truffle fries any time!!
After trying my first churros served at Churrosity, I was kinda disappointed because it was passable. Maybe because it wasn\'t made on the spot so it didn\'t taste that good. Grub was the second place that I tried churros and I got to say, it\'s really awesome. It was served hot and the sauce served was well-made. Plus the fact that it\'s only $9 for 8 pieces, Grub just made me fall in love with churros. Back at Grub the second time and I am still as pleased (y\'know how some food taste good at the first try and then when you\'re back the second time, it tastes normal, leaving you all disappointed). Now I\'m on a mission to search for delicious churros served in Singapore :) #churros
