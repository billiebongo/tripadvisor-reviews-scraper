My first time having eggs benny with crispy pork belly, a duo of my favorite food.
Brunch comes at an affordable SGD$15 nett with a choice of coffee,  tea or soda. Juicy patty with the cheese perfectly melted on it.
Said the staff. The arrogance was quite turn-offish; but their Short Ribs Burger (S$25) was pretty damn good I\'ll give them that. The patty was thick, moist, juicy and perfectly medium; caramelized onions were lovely; sesame buns were just-kill-me soft; and fries were commendable. Two peeves: first the fat in the patty wasn\'t the melt-in-your-mouth sort but the overcooked rubbery type; second, way way way too much BBQ sauce. Clean that up and maybe - just maybe - it\'ll be the best at its price point.
No hype, just a damn good burger with an equally fantastic sauce. Must try.
Slow braised 15 hour beef brisket. So tender. So freaking delicious! What a secret find.
FRIENDLY FAMILY PLACE with great food and icy cold beer! \n<br />Thanks Heikel for the great service!!!
This was on the Kid\'s Menu and the owner seemed quite reluctant to let me order it, which quite frankly was baffling. He eventually gave in seeing as I had ordered 3 other dishes. A decent mac n cheese but the cheeses used weren\'t particularly flavourful nor was the portion representative of its price. The kitchen staff also got my order wrong the first time and on top of that left out the salad and fries. I\'d go back for the craft beers and ambience, but perhaps not the food.
A heavily seasoned patty of short rib and sirloin topped with melty Monterey Jack, air dried Spanish ham , and BBQ sauce. I liked it, but was left feeling slightly short changed given the hefty price tag and its relatively small size. Better gourmet burgers to be had at Adrift or Bread Street Kitchen for that sort of money.
Situated in an idyllic corner in Changi overlooking the sea, Little Island Brewing Co is a microbrewery that offers an extensive selection of self-brewed craft beers as well as grilled meats. Start with their Beer Belly Porchetta ($12) ‚Äî slow-cooked Berkshire belly marinated in coffee, cumin and chilli with salsa verde. If a burger is what you crave, then their deliciously umami Short Rib Burger ($25) should satisfy. If you\'re lucky, you might be able to catch a glimpse of their highly elusive Beeramisu ‚Äî sponge soaked in Imperial Stout with mascarpone, coconut sugar and cocoa!
Love the fries here!
Ok, that\'s all.

Love love the onion flavoring! 
Despite the mishaps.. I would love to thank Liz from @projectatrios for providing such a beautiful 3-tier cake for the @thedrinkseekers wedding. From chocolate to salted egg yolk and raspberry lemon, the entire constitution was genius!
Crispy batter fish that was fried without being greasy.

ON POINT. ~ the chicken so incredibly tender and crumbed with expert hands, smothered in a tomato sauce that carries a heavy hit of chili pairing well with the @omnipollo double #IPA Nebuchadnezzar fresh from the taps„ÄÇ
Neh... Who am I kidding„ÄÇ\n<br />ÔΩû\n<br />The {Short Rib Burger} from @littleislandbrewingco deserves a holla. üôãüèª So hop on over to my **NEW Blogpost** to suss out my take on this newish brew pubÔºÅ
Then you\'re looking at your best solution„ÄÇ\n<br />-\n<br />@littleislandbrewingco\n<br />-\n<br />Because with 4 days to kill, beer and some solid smoked meats is the best solution„ÄÇ// For the üçª geeks: they have @sirencraftbrew Calypso ~ a Berliner style sour beer, @Omnipollo Zodiak and the Bristol Beer Factory\'s Independence IPA on tap!!! #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #burpple #hungrygowhere #igsg #sipandgulp #8dayseat #foodporn #burgersaremynemesis #eyecandySorted
I would.... Only if it was as good as @littleislandbrewingco
So that\'s the {Short Ribs Burger} in play. Fancy pants.... Extremely rich and nutty and umami in nature. This is one burger where the patty takes precedence„ÄÇ
Life doesn\'t get better„ÄÇ
Moist slabs of pork belly braised in beer and finished off on the grill for that pop, snap and crackle, the result is something magical ~ Only made better by that insanely addictive Memphis coleslaw of course. \n<br />Despite its ulu location, I believe that good food is definitely a cause worth braving the traffic for. So go the distance and support this newly opened brewery (opened on the 1st July) soon, coz if you won\'t, I will„ÄÇ
