Be whisked away to France with these yummy crepes, that have an Asian twist to them as well! Think Thai flavours in one of them, which was definitely a surprising explosion in our mouths 🌟🌟🌟
Absolutely love this savory French buckwheat flour crêpe consisting of copious amounts of melty Emmental cheese that complements flavors of ham, sunny side up egg, mushrooms and tomatoes.
This seem like the normal brunches we get.
Oh so yummy and good! More pictures to come in the following days! Thank you @madamechewy for the invite! I had so much fun eating all the food! 🙆☺️
Really a ménage à 4, because I chose to omit mushrooms, the other components being ham, emmental, egg and tomato. Loved the first few bites, when the edges of the crepe were still lightly crisp, but the taste got quite monotonous halfway through. Very filling, though, so I couldn\'t even finish the entire thing anyway. 
Happy lunch date with @azwuzz at the creperie down my office block. Guess what\'s in my buckwheat crepe? 
The dessert crepes at Le Comptoir were at least a 7/10. At 
A unique twist to typical crepes. Fresh ingredients like tomatoes, eggs, ham, mushroom enveloped within the thin layer of crepe. Fresh and good tasting to such creations! Totally in love with such savory crepes! 
This relaxing restaurant specialises in crêpes. I tried the \"Coco Chanel\"- yes, you read that right - which consists of dark chocolate, sliced almonds, poached pears and the lightest chantilly cream. The crêpe is slightly chewy and the ingredients compliment each other nicely with the different textures and flavours. Shall go back soon to try their savoury ones!
Perfect end to a weekday lunch
With ham, ermmental cheese, mushroom and egg. I ordered it without tomatoes. 
All the good stuff wrapped in the crepes! Today\'s crepe is little burnt though. 
French\'s buckwheat crepe with prosciutto, emmental and berries mouse on the side, paired it with dry pear cider, heavenly!

Surprising satisfying and filling. 👍🏻 #howtonotbefat #ocomptoir #burpple
So goooOood...😋 #fridaylunch
Used the entertainer app to make it a luxurious lunch on the cheap but in any case there are set lunches going for about $15++ onwards to make it more worthwhile for non entertainer users. Definitely will revisit with the 2 remaining coupons I have left.\n<br />#sgrestaurant #crepe #cbd #sgfoodie #burpple

delish and not too filling (no post-lunch syndrome) plus they come in set lunch prices below SGD20! best part? the decor is great, place is relatively quiet (go early at 12pm!) and the staff have outstanding good service! @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia #singapore #brunch #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgcafe #sgcafehopping @cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @ocomptoir79

Really good chocolate &amp; berry crepe with dry rose cider. So good I started it before I remembered to take the photo. Oops. The savoury one was delicious too.
