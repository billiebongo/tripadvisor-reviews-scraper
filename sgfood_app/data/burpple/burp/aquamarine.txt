Asian dishes (eg chicken rice, rendang), italian pasta, sushi &amp; sashimi, cold raw seafood, desserts
Generally impressed by the quality and variety of this halal buffet spread, well-priced at $70++ for dinner with card discounts of up to 15%. Variety-wise, there is something for everyone here - from local fare, main suspects such as Japanese, Indian, and European, to less common ones like Middle Eastern cuisine. Famed for their seafood, the selection, quality, and freshness certainly didn\'t disappoint. Tip: Make a beeline for the huge Alaskan crab claws before they get all snapped up.
It is a little expensive, but it is worth it with more than 10 stations of food, a delightful spread of desserts, a Japanese station that serves sliced-upon-order sashimi and an amazing seafood spread. The best thing is, it is halal-certified.
One of the better sushi at #sushidai in singapore. Lusting for the real deal at Tsukiji though..

This is one Chilli Crab where your hands will remain clean after eating it.\n<br />.\n<br />The sauce is tangy, creamy with a subtle kick of spiciness. The softshell crab has a crispy exterior with juicy flesh. Don\'t miss out on the fried bun, this will help you to polish up the delicious suace.\n<br />.
The version here is white in colour, same as the usual otak-otak that we get in Indonesia.\n<br />.\n<br />It has a bouncy texture with bits of chopped chilli blend into the otah. You will get Ompph seafood flavour in each bite.\n<br />.\n<br />This is one of the menu available for Exclusive Iftar spread at AquaMarine @marinamandarinsg during this Ramadan Period (24 May to 26 June 2017).\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #huffposttaste\n<br />#halalfoodsg #halalbuffetsg #iftarsg #openricesg #marinamandarinsg #otah #otakotak #sgbuffet #buffetsg #seafoodotah

.\n<br />Filled with briny shrimp paste and tamarind juice in the right proportion, it was spicy, sour and \"pungent\" enough to set up my appetite for more following this.\n<br />.\n<br />I topped up my bowl with as much flaky mackerel, chunky pineapple and shredded onion as I wanted since it\'s buffet üòà. Every mouthful of fat beehoon soaked in the soup is worth the calories.\n<br />.\n<br />Remember to hit this DIY station if you are going for the buffet at Aquamarine.
