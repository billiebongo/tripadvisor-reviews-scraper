Let\'s prepare our hearts and minds as we move towards Easter(:
Have a great week ahead everyone! Stay happy and God bless(:
Very nice Zhu Zha Tang for lunch. Looks like Wimbly Lu\'s waffle gotta save for the next time
First up - Zion Road Siang Hee Zichar. Roast pork + sambal kang kong. This is so delicious!Would be better if there were more chilli padi!
Pretty decent &amp; value for money!
In the same kopishop as isteak. Pretty gd selection of good food affordable prices
Yummy local breakfast + great people watching #weekend #breakfast
$3.50 for nice laksa plus added cockles. Shiok!
Soya sauce chicken thigh and drumstick plus chicken rice $5.50.\n<br />.\n<br />The meat is tender and succulent, braised just right. The soya souce is rich is flavour and gave you the WOW feeling when you bite into it.\n<br />.\n<br />The chicken is al-dente and fragant, however I feel missing a bit of oiliness in it.\n<br />.\n<br />A very good soya sauce chicken. If they can get the sauce to penetrate more into the meat, it will be great. .\n<br />Definitely worth a visit at:\n<br />Wo Lai Ye @hokeewolaiye\n<br />Stall 1, Serangoon Garden Market &amp; Food Centre.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #soyasaucechicken #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #nomnom #STfoodtrending \n<br />#topcitybites #vscofood #foodoftheday #fdprn #hokeewolaiyesoyasaucechickenrice #chickenrice #jiaklocal
And guess what..we spent almost 20bucks on bread?!?! (Haha but not me! My 4 cream puffs, 1 banana cake, 1 walnut cake and 1 otah bun were only worth $6 plus..) Someone ended up buying 10 tuna and otah buns ($1.10/1.20 each) for his family!üò± #serangoongardenbakery #serangoongardens #burpple #burpplesg
With the addition of garlic, chili, and vinegar, the result is a blast of flavours that clings to the noodles as you slurp them up.\n<br />.\n<br />Generous chunks of braised pork belly are scattered in, with fried fish and braised egg. The pork belly pieces have been stewed for a long time, leaving the meat tender and the fats rendered. For $4, this simple hawker fare is delicious and value for money.\n<br />.\n<br />A definite stopover to satisfy your lor mee cravings, reminiscent of the good old days!\n<br />_______________\n<br />Chuan Heng Fish Ball Minced Meat Noodle\n<br />Serangoon Garden Market &amp; Food Centre\n<br />49A Serangoon Garden Way, Stall 3\n<br />Singapore 555945\n<br />.\n<br />#ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #dojoeats
Who says only Famous Amos has free smells, the aroma of these wins me any day. Between the ‚ÄúHam‚Äù-burger (luncheon meat buns) and Ham &amp; Cheese buns, it‚Äôs a toss up between these two favorites but on this very day, the luncheon meat buns triumphed. Many thanks to @mooisreddy for getting these buns on the last day of our reservist, a perfect ending to our annual retreat in the army.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Serangoon Gardens Bakery &amp; Confectionery\n<br />Address: 49A,¬†Serangoon Garden Way, Serangoon Garden Market and Food Centre, Unit 01-45, Singapore 555945\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock
Found some comfort food here: $1 beancurd, kway chap, and pig organ\'s soup - each deserves its own post.

‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />The teeny tiny bean helps to detoxify, relieves heatiness, low in calories just to name a few. Some would add alittle coconut milk to make it more tasty. But I prefer it just the way it is. Old school snacks that hopefully would not disappear from the food scene.
The beef chunks given were marinated nicely while being tender as well!
