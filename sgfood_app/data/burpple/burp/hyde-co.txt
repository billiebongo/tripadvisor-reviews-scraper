Hyde\'s Chilli Crab Pasta ($22.90)\n<br />I\'ve had this before; I liked it then, still like it now.
Firecracker ($22.90)
One of the popular dishes at Hyde and Co. has got to be their signature pasta, the Hyde\'s Chilli Crab Pasta ($22.90). With a concept similar to the eccentricity of Jekyll and Hyde, this fusion dish has the Italian flair of using blue swimmer crab while paying homage to the Asian chilli crab sauce through a homemade spicy Arrabiatta. Mixed in with linguine pasta and finished with herbed panko bread crumbs, this is a fusion pasta dish that\'s worth trying out when you are here.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Hyde and Co.\n<br />Address: 785, North Bridge Road, Singapore 198753
Talk about unique. Have you ever tried a chye poh prawn omelette pizza? Well, I can now say I have! 😂
Satay Capellini comes with lemongrass satay, tempura morning glory, ngoh hiang and angel hair pasta.
Love the little white dining area but food was okay. Had the chicken waffle(portion was big) also the salmon.
Had the Cod Mentaiko Spaghetti. It was a little too heavy but I liked it. The cod was tender with crispy skin. Really enjoyed this.
Ondeh Ondeh French Toast - the thick slices of brioche french toast was the perfect canvas for the grated pandan coconut and scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.
hate to admit this but the desserts at Hyde &amp; Co. didn\'t quite meet our expectations 😥..\n<br />•\n<br />#disappointed
Salted egg crawfish mac &amp; cheese ($22) topped with torched mentaiko Norwegian crawfish. How does one resist not ordering this plate that includes cheese, salted egg &amp; mentaiko? Tho it gets alil jerlat at the end with the thick cream &amp; salted egg sauce. It\'s slightly pricey for the portion tho 😕
Chilli Crab Pasta, $21.
Such humble dish topped with torched mentaiko norwegian crawfish. Its a matrimonial celebration to one\'s palette!

It\'s Sundayyyy! Yeah! Keep Calm &amp; Have a Fried Chicken Waffle with a yummilicious gooey Egg 😄
🔸\n<br />I loved how the the Mac &amp; cheese blended well with the fresh torched mentaiko Norwegian crayfish and drizzled with delectable salted egg sauce, yummy!!\n<br />🔹\n<br />Overall I\'ll recommend this dish but the portion could be bigger TBH 😔
Tried the salted egg risotto as well as the chilli crab pasta which was pretty well executed. \n<br />The Ondeh Ondeh French toast and mantou pulled pork was pretty average though. Overall not an experience that calls me back for more.
Just launched two days ago on National Day so I chose this over the rest. Salted Egg Mac &amp; Cheese topped with torched Mentaiko Norwegian Crawfish. Whew its name is so long. The combination of salted egg yolk and truckloads of cheese was just nice! It has the feel of crushed egg yolk (meaning it was really made with salted egg yolk and not powder) so it was really savory and I don\'t get sick of it at all. In fact I wished I had more of it even at the end 😭 So this really does the salted egg yolk justice 😍 As for the crawfish, I guess I still prefer a big crayfish over its tiny versions 😂 Imagine they had to peel all the shells to get all these... it\'s hard, scary work.
So my good friend and I was supposed to have dinner @ The Ramen Stall, which is just next to Hyde &amp; Co. But because there was a long queue, we decided to give Hyde &amp; Co a try instead.
🙊\n<br />🔸\n<br />I love the chili crab pasta with generous chunks of crabmeat, cooked to perfection. The Nazz\'s Mac &amp; Cheese consist of roasted mushrooms, torched panko, delicious strips of turkey bacon bits and crumbs, really appetizing! 👍🏻\n<br />🔸\n<br />The main highlight was the butterscotch popcorn waffle with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream atop bananas and drizzled with butterscotch and nuts, satisfied my sweet tooth immensely.
Have a great day ahead filled with lotsa food ya!! 🔺On a side note: Did you see what I see?? 😍😄 Thank you @damien_tc 🔺\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />📍 Hyde &amp; Co\n<br />785 North Bridge Road\n<br />Singapore 198753\n<br />Tel: 66355785\n<br />hydeandco.com.sg\n<br />Wed to Sat 11am - 10pm\n<br />Sun to Mon 11am - 6pm\n<br />(Closed on Tues)

Personally, the Ha Cheong Kai Waffle with fried egg and fries wasn\'t really that bad a combination. And the sauce they use is honey dijon which changes the sweet to a savoury waffle. It\'s like a whole chicken life cycle on your plate. The spicy Chilli crab pasta is made with real crab so I think it would add brownie points to this dish. Ribeye at the side can be cooked to the way you like so my Friend chose medium rare. Give it a try! It\'s Halal so why not? 😊
4 munchies: Tossed in homemade arrabbiata sauce, every strand of the well-cooked linguine was evenly coated with shredded chunks of blue swimmer crab. The sauce had a good balance of sweet and sour, though I\'d have liked it a tad spicier. The herbed panko topping added texture and cherry tomatoes gave it a dose of freshness, making the Chilli Crab Pasta an ideal choice for both brunch and dinner!
Finally managed to try the Ondeh Ondeh French Toast here!! 🙆 For the best experience, take a bit of everything for every bite. I was surprised how this combination worked really well.
Located along North Bridge Road, this restaurant has been quickly gaining traction in Burpple\'s Muslim community for both its East-meets-West dishes as well as its minimalist interior. Come with your date and start with the simple but satisfying Beef Brisket Man Tou ($10) — slow cooked pulled beef brisket in a homemade barbecue sauce, stuffed into freshly fried, pillowy soft mantous. For mains, Hyde\'s Chili Crab Pasta ($18) comes highly recommended — expect al dente linguine tossed in a homemade spicy (they mean fiery!) arrabiatta sauce and topped with a generous portion of blue swimmer crab. End your meal on a sweet note with the Ondeh Ondeh Toast ($12), grated pandan coconut over two fluffy brioche toasts. It is served alongside vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with gula melaka sauce.\n<br />Avg price: $30 per person\n<br />*Halal-certified\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Veronica Phua
This pasta dish was part of the $25+ iftar set menu during Ramadan 2016 (in addition to the soup of the day- a velveteen mushroom soup with small chunks of mushrooms, and an iced Moroccan apple tea, which did not exhibit any apple notes in my opinion....). The generous chunks of crab meat was sweet and the linguine cooked al dente, however I found it too spicy for my palate (although my boyfriend didn\'t mind the spice). I\'ve tried chili crab pastas in several other cafes and I\'d definitely come back for this. I just wish the portion size would be a liiiiiitle bigger though 😄
Toast with a runny egg hidden like a treasure in the centre of the toast, topped with homemade arrabiatta sauce, mushrooms and melted cheddar. I love this dish so much I\'ve eaten it twice! The runny egg yolk ties everything together and all the ingredients go very well together. 
3 fluffy pancakes topped with bananas, walnuts, cereal, vanilla ice cream topped with butterscotch drizzle. Extremely delicious combination but also extremely filling, finishing all 3 pancakes can be a feat as it gets very sweet towards the end. 
all the more to gather your Muslim frens to brunch here. prolly one of the better halal brunch places in Singapore
\nIf my late Peranakan grandmother were around to have Hyde\'s Chilli Crab Pasta, I am sure this is what she\'d say about the dish:\n<br />\"Waaaah! Cukup pedas. Cukup manis. Cukup assam. Sedap sekali!\"
I thought it\'s quite bold to include a Beef Cheek Rendang Rice Bowl in the lunch menu considering the surrounding area of Kampong Glam is full of very good Nasi Padang eateries offering this beloved classic meat dish. But the one from Hyde &amp; Co. is quite different because of its casual chic presentation, addition of roasted potatoes, carrots and fresh tomatoes, and low level of spiciness (there\'s a Western stew influence for sure). Personally, I\'d like the beef to have absorbed more of the \"rempah\" but the tenderness of it cannot be faulted.
I thought it was quite clever to have \"man tou\" act as mini burger buns to hold the pulled beef brisket. The barbecue sauce used to slow-cook the beef was also made in-house but it came across on my palate as more sweet than smokey or tangy. As I do not like my food too sweet (desserts don\'t count! 😁 ), I was glad the chef added some creamy slaw to temper it. \n

Giving the otherwise basic brioche French toast a local twist. Generously topped with grated pandan coconut and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, it resembles one of my favourite kueh: Ondeh Ondeh. It\'s simple and nothing to exclaim about until one pour Gula Melaka all over, drenching the toast in this sweet sauce!
🌶🦀🍝 MANTOU SLIDERS! &amp; a fancy schmancy Ondeh Ondeh French Toast that was a good balance of flavours (not overly sweet / also you can\'t go wrong with brioche EVER mmm) (📷: @beaverwoo)
☀️☀️☀️ This quote rings true at Hyde &amp; Co. 🍵🍃 Love how cheery and bright this cafe is &amp; service was really good! Barista made the goddaughter a babyccino hehehe (can tell he was like besotted with her lololol) 👧🏻
😋 Alice in Wonderland is a gorgeous light pink rose tea with notes of the familiar bandung drink 🌹 // The Addams Family is a refreshing fruit tea with a mild tartness from the apple cubes that\'s offset by the sugar coating the rim of the glass. 🍏 I\'m a coffee person la but I really fell in love with these teas 😍
after wanting to try it for ages and had girl time over our Iced Alice in Wonderland and Addams Family Tea / Beef Brisket Mantou Sliders / Ondeh Ondeh French Toast and Chilli Crab Pasta! Yummy noms + great service = happy bellies and double likes 👍🏻👍🏻
march holidays are finally here, which means more cafe hopping!! i can\'t miss out on my morning dose of coffee, so i decided to get the Café Latte ($5.50). the cute presentation of this cuppa immediately made me smile! it was too cute i didn\'t even want to drink it 😍 looks aside, this latte wasn\'t acidic and had a creamy flavour to it. i prefer my coffee to be less acidic, so this cup satisfied me. both taste and presentation definitely made my morning a whole lot better 😌
Especially if it\'s fancy shaken tea in a fancy glass that tastes mighty good! You see The Addams Family (iced Moroccan apple tea) and the Prince of Egypt (iced peppermint tea with drops of lemon juice) here. I\'m pretty excited to head back to @hydeandco to check out the rest of their drinks and food! More about their food in a bit.
I don\'t really remember what I ordered, but it wasn\'t bad! It was a really good place to just sit down &amp; chillax &amp; gossip the entire afternoon! Their Buffalo were DAMN GOOD 😻
Simple plate of buttermilk scones from @sconemarkit with house made strawberry compote and Chantilly cream. The $15 set includes a pot of tea in the most precious teapots. It\'s a really small pricy bite for brunch and the scone was lacking in density. Perhaps try their other heartier offerings, unless you\'re pretending to be on a diet. Me? I\'m off to a heartier brunch after ashtanga! Happy Sunday people!! 😊
The beef cheek is cooked to such tenderness that it literally melt in your mouth. With roasted mushroom and tomato confit, I dare to say it is one hearty dish that is worth all the calories.
Specially concocted using the China Rose Tea from Hyde &amp; Co Tea Selection with milk. Tasted like a lighter &amp; healthier version of iced bandung. Well, at least it is made of the real stuff and not rose syrup. Guilt free beverage in shade of pretty pink. Me love😍😍😍
You are deeply missed! \n<br />Thanks @damien_tc for this amazing pour!! O_o I\'m so dead today .. Ball speed -1.😖 #noRogerNoThrow @rogerni
Would\'ve been so much better if they use flavored popcorn (e.g. Garrett)
Not a coffee-drinker, so I\'m such a fan of these exquisite affogatos made with premium vanilla ice cream and shots of the Hyde Tea Collection instead! There are four to choose from: • Millie: Vintage Earl Grey tea with orange segments and zest – this was the hot favourite!\n<br />• Matilda: Strawberry Ceylon tea with fresh diced strawberries and berry compote – for those who prefer something milder.\n<br />• Charlie: Chocolate Meringue tea with drizzles of salted chocolate – for all the sweet tooths out there.\n<br />• Hamilton: Spiced Lapsang Souchong tea with sesame – the one I wasn\'t expecting to like but which turned out to be a intriguingly addictive.
Craving for some nasi lemak and I had always love risotto, I never thought these 2 can be a perfect combination! [Nasi Lemak Risotto S$22] with chef\'s homemade Sambal with prawns and topped with poached egg! Definitely something I will order again.
O. M. G.
Dusted with snow powder &amp; salted caramel drizzle.
Cosy space, friendly staff as well as Hyde &amp; Co. \'s highly instagramable offerings make for a nice place to chill and cause one to want to spend a lazy afternoon there. Savoury or sweet, I couldn’t decide so instead of a main I opted for a side, Pulled Pork Man Tou ($9 for 3) and for dessert, Butterscotch Popcorn Waffle. Sandwiched between two deep-fried buns, their juicy slow cooked pulled pork in homemade BBQ sauce was made more sinful with the crispy exterior of the mantou and soft center. Wishing the banana slices were caramelised, the waffle was a great balance of textures and the premium artisanal vanilla bean ice cream was the icing on the cake.
That plush gingerbread waffle topped with soft wedges of spiced caramelised apples, wine-poached raisins, pine nuts, vanilla bean ice cream, lashings of salted caramel and icing sugar \"snow\" – SO MUCH CHRISTMASSY FEEL. I\'d dig this over turkey or log cake any time.
$17. Egg was beautifully poached and went perfectly with the cheese and mushrooms. Only gripe was the amount of oil on top that had to be dabbed off. 
We had the speedy Gonzales - featuring 6 hr slow braised pull pork, creamy scrambled eggs and guacamole and the berry compote waffles :)
😌 started my day heading to Hyde &amp; Co to have brunch with my sissy! \n<br />Not that there\'s anything bad about it, but why do people tend to give me puzzled looks when I ask whether coffee is served as a single or double shot &amp; when I understood what a ristretto mean? Just a thought. 🤔 \n<br />That aside, I must say that this store has definitely lived up to it\'s hype! The mains were pretty good. Oh &amp; happy one year anniversary to the owners of @hydeandco 🎉
bitter espresso sauce went perfectly with the sweet and fluffy marshmallows! waffles lacked the crunch and airiness but kudos to Hyde and Co for creative flavors!!! 
Beef Cheek Rendang ($25) - Super tender beef that Ah Ma Liu and her dentures are at a full blown party 😹 Paired with sweet potato mash and slaw and crostini and flavoured with homemade rendang to infuse some interesting twist to their usual western fare! \n<br />Thanks #HydeandCo for hosting and @shauneeie for extending the invite!!
One of my top picks on the new @hydeandco dinner menu showcases the chef\'s prowess at fusing local flavours into western dishes. The nasi lemak risotto is exactly what one might envision it to be – fragrant rice cooked al dente, albeit with a smattering of undercooked grains, in coconut water and thickened with coconut cream, then sprinkled with lemon zest and lemongrass oil for subtle complexity.
Available every Wednesday to Saturday from 6:30-10:30pm.\n<br />•\n<br />A classic mac and cheese perfumed with truffle oil. Baked with creamy béchamel, candied bacon, generous amount of cheese (cheddar and mozzarella), and panko for extra crunch.\n<br />•\n<br />So creamy and cheesy. My kind of #comfortfood.
Off the new dinner menu served every Wednesday to Saturday from 6.30-10.30pm at @hydeandco are these fried chicken wings glazed with chipotle BBQ sauce. The meat was a little tough, but that coating of sticky sauce was uber tasty, especially when paired with the made-from-scratch aioli that\'s complete with soft bits of roasted garlic – I get first dibs if they ever bottle that stuff for sale.
So refreshing and yummy. I like the tanginess from the berries that opens up my appetite to welcome my food!!! 😋😋😋😋😋\n<br />On the side note, @hydeandco is open for Christmas Dinner reservation now. Make your reservation before 14th Dec to enjoy 10% off your bill.

Served with a tea shot of Hyde Tea Collection with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, I think this is just good enuff to end the night in a sweet note😋
imagine a risotto in flames served in front of you. fancy this? okay I\'m kidding there\'s no flames whatsoever.
Super impressed with this. Waffle was really crisp, fluffy inside and tastes great. With butterscotch sauce drizzled on top...perfect. The artisanal vanilla ice cream had a good light flavour but was rather icy. Was dying to caramelise the banana slices to make it THE perfect dessert.
crumbles on top, u dig ur fork straight through the heart of the dish, slowly pulling the chunk out. that intertwining melted cheese gluing itself on the macaroni. \n<br />and all u gotta do is to open your mouth and chew.
have u heard of the saying - don\'t accept drinks from a stranger? \n<br />well I normally do.
The day is finally approaching! \n<br />Thanks @damien_tc for the coffee art!

Crunchy toast with marshmallows, banana and dark chocolate sauce. Perfecting vanilla ice cream for the fairy sweet tooth. 
(Rant warning) So for my bday dessert I chose Mr Frosty, A Smore Brioche French toast, Chocolate, Marshmallow Fluff, Caramelised Bananas, Nuts, Butterscotch Drizzle Topped with Premium Butterscotch Vanilla Bean Ice cream. \n<br />I was sold by the description and chose that over the waffle. But look at the fair looking toast and tell me it\'s French?! No eggs &amp; milk coating before it was toasted for sure. When we double checked w them whether this is a French Toast. They indignantly mentioned that because the chef didn\'t want it to be soggy. Why would a French toast be soggy if you do it well to order? Kinda spoilt my bday brunch a little.. But I shall let it go after this rant. #burpple
Thank you @apolishedgeek and Liao! Go for the hot tea when you\'re here. Love the Adam and Eve. Black tea with notes of rose,caramel and hazelnut! #burpple
Have seen several post abt their chilli crab pasta. But wasn\'t exactly wowed by it. The crab is all shredded and minced up, so you don\'t really taste it. Plus the sauce is on the sweet side rather than spicy. Would eat it once but prob not again?
Tis the season to eat WAFFLES! This gingerbread infused waffle is the reason to rejoice this holiday season!! :D $14.90 
Care for a spot of tea? Adapted from a 150 year old recipe, this blend of assam and ceylon tea leaves, infused with citrus and bergamot, is rich and deep with notes of spice.
you see that special cup with fries and ice cream?
Straight forward, no frills. Surprised the roasted potatoes were actually quite yummy!
those plump juicy sambas prawns and the poached egg will leave u wanting for more. \n<br />on another note, @hydeandco will be taking reservation for their anniversary dinner starting today. call 6635 5785 to make a reservation.
If only you could smell this and TASTE this - Truffle Mac and Cheese ($21) from @hydeandco\'s brand new dinner menu!
(You need to pay $24 now instead of $2.40 😂) Risotto cooked in coconut milk infused with lemongrass, the texture maybe slightly strange but once you mixed in some of these homemade sambal, you will find yourself on familiar ground. Included are 3 crunchy prawns and topped with a poached egg, fried onions and some ikan bilis ( ingredients that you usually find in Nasi Lemak). Made good use of the 1 for 1 mains on their anniversary and soft lanuch for their dinner menu which is coincidentally available tomorrow 😊
🌴 Fragrance of coconut milk was strong! The greenie pandan layers were soft and fluffy, together with the gula melaka infused desiccated coconut sandwiched between the layers, it was nomnomnom! The buttercream and shredded coconut on the surface may make you think the cake is very sweet but surprisingly its NOT :) •
Fried mantou with crisp edges and a touch of sweetness encapsulating chunks of shredded sweet and savory juicy pulled pork accompanied with some caramelized onions and coleslaw. Burst of sweet savory flavor into your mouth upon a bite into the mantou. It tasted special due to the touch of sweetness on a supposedly savory dish. 
Haha!\n<br />.\n<br />Now you can have your ponggol nasi lemak in the morning, and have this Nasi Lemak Risotto that comes with 3 succulent prawns with that sambal with an amazing kick, from @hydeandco\'s NEW dinner menu in commemoration of their first anniversary! Expect other amazing dishes like OUR FAVORITE TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE, and really Interesting renditions of burgers!
Thanks @derrickchew &amp; @hydeandco for the invite! Really love the sticky date pudding for the dessert! Spot this shadow when I am trying to take the food photos. \n<br />#hydeandco #sgcafe #cafehopping #burpple #shadowplay
🔥Chili buddies blends so well with the chocolate • One sip and you will be in Merryland • Hopefully this drink will be added to their new menu 😄 • Thanks @damien_tc for this 🔥kicky creation!
Throwback to a really pretty brunch on a really quiet weekend. 
Good morning!!! This is Mr. Bear presenting you a flower to mark the start of a wonderful Sunday. Lovely latte art by the barista over at Hyde &amp; Co. 
@hydeandco has recently launched a lunch menu for the working folks during weekdays.
A lot drier and a lot less tomato-ey than any other chilli crab pasta around, this arrabiatta packs a huge dose of spice in every mouthful. Shredded crabmeat lace the strands of al dente linguine, showered with herbed panko for added texture.
Great start to a lazy hazy Saturday! We ordered: The Big Ben (top) ($21), The Piggadilly (bottom) ($16), &amp; last but not least Truffle Fries ($12). I had the Piggadilly, which was a toasted bagel served with slow cooked pulled pork, homemade coleslaw &amp; fries. The pulled pork was cooked perfectly, and the sauce it was cooked in gave it a perfect seasoning. Together with the bagel which was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, gave the whole dish so much flavour. I would definitely come back again for it. I also snacked a little on the Truffle Fries which came with Garlic Aioli &amp; House Sweet Chilli. I loved the sweet chilli sauce, it went well with the Truffle fries. It\'s such a pity Truffle Fries are always so expensive. Great ambience too! I would want to come back again. Oh, and this place is very instagram worthy as well! 
Poached eggs and hollandaise on smoked salmon on mushroom jam on English muffins (which were very good, by the way). Roast potatoes and extra crispy bacon on the side = NOMS.
Hyde &amp; Co\'s signature Waffles with caramelised bananas, popcorn and a scoop of vanilla icecream - decadence in a mouthful. Perfect way to end a lazy weekend brunch. #cafeculture 
Weekend brunch at this lovely Brit inspired cafe in the Kampong Glam area where cafes abound. Loved the whitewashed interiors and posters dedicated to tea. Speaking of which they do have a mighty fine selection of tea too, served in delicately flowered porcelain ware. Grub was pretty good and service was friendly. This cafe certainly scores big. 
Didn\'t taste honey in our Sencha Honey Tea but well, green tea on itself is still nice! Waffles is crispy on the outside and soft inside! Perfect match with the bananas and ice cream! It is slightly on the sweeter side but goes very well with teas. Oh, the popcorn was a letdown though. 
buttermilk waffles drizzled generously with butterscotch sauce and a lot on top of that - popcorn, caramelized bananas and vanilla ice cream. Yum.
Pity that my stomach is sensitive to food that are too oily, otherwise I would have finish it.
let me make it better for you on this wafflicious Tuesday
- Chilli crab pasta\n<br />- Pulled pork mantou - Pulut Hitam waffle\n<br />- My fair lady\n<br />- Mocha
Wanted to go for the high-tea but it wasn\'t available so we ordered the usuals instead. They have really interesting flavours for their waffles like butterscotch popcorn! Would like to go back to try more things and hopefully the high tea set will be available🙏
These waffles were so close to perfection. I had the buttermilk popcorn waffles with vanilla bean ice cream ($14) First things first, waffles were crisp and relatively good. Popcorn was a little soggy but the caramelized bananas made me feel so warm the second I put it in my mouth. It was soooo good. I guess you could rate it an overall of 7/10. It\'s worth trying
specially prepared by talented @damien_tc, a black swan for me aka the white swan. too beautiful to drink and I was so afraid to mess up the design once I slurped. fortunately, the swan remains till the very end. \n<br />head over to @hydeandco to enjoy the latte art and their newly launched pulut hitam waffles!
too much smoked salmon leh 🙅🏻 :) ($17) yummy though.  but after adding scrambled eggs and roasted potatoes as sides (not in the pic), I can\'t finish the brunch at all. I need variety so it is better if the main is smaller in portion... 😘✌🏼️🙅🏻😋👍🏼🍴🍳 #hydeandco #sgbrunch #salmon #lunch #breakfast
Not sure why the name, but this pool of tender pulled pork mixed in sweet barbecue sauce paired with creamy scrambled eggs served atop a piece of tortilla came in such a generous portion, it took me quite a long while to finally finish everything! 
Compared to the other versions I\'ve tried elsewhere that tend to be on the sweet side, I like how this is just outright spicy. I did wish for the crab meat to be in chunky pieces instead though, as the fine shreds seemed to lose the crab flavor after being mixed into the pasta sauce.
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Café Hopping
$12 nett this is definitely on my best pancakes in SG list! Stack of thin buttery pancakes (that were slightly savory I\'m guessing salted butter here) went amazingly well with vanilla bean ice cream and affogato sauce! If that doesn\'t sound drool-worthy think melted marshmellow complementing a coffee based sauce and buttery pancakes..... just..... get this already!!! 
Thick cut truffle fries and some pulled pork man tous for decent savory starters before I dive into my amazingly sweet brunch (-: 
Had the nacho chips very different from other cafes. Very crisp and crunchy, the 2 dips was the bomb very refreshing and slightly savouring. Waffle was done to perfection, crispy on the outside and not cakey in the inside.
👍🏻 can\'t wait for a breakfast/brunch spread like this. 😌😋
It was spicy though.  Too \"lemaky\" so preferred less of the sauce. Garlic was a tad \"overdone\". Didnt quite enjoy this dish but have tried the other mains which were better. #pasta #crabs #brunch #burpplesg #burpple #openricesg  @hydeandco
The waffle was razor crispy on the outside and the combination of popcorn and crushed nuts provided a substantial amount of jaw activity while the butterscotch, probably fearful of heights, antisocially remained in the centre of the waffle area. 3.7/5 
chili crab pasta - deliciously melt in my mouth. Pasta tenderness is perfectly blended with the sauces and ingredients. Perfect! I\'d say this one is 8.5 put of 10
It feels like a thousand crab sprinkle with chili and starts to dance in my mouth.
My friend ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and i ordered the butterscotch popcorn waffles, sharing a pot of honey sencha tea at the same time. The honey sencha tea (4/5) was really good, as you can taste nodes of honey while drinking the tea itself, really refreshing and light. The smoked salmon eggs benedict for my friend, it was quite awkward for her as the salmon did not match the taste of the mushroom jam that was served with the eggs benedict. The dressing from the salad also made the muffins soggy. Not a good dish, but try if you are exploring different eggs benedict (2/5). The butterscotch waffles took some time, but it was worth it. The artisan vanilla ice cream came just soft and not so sweet, complementing with the bananas and popcorn served with the waffles. A chef\'s recommendation there, definitely worth a try (4/5)
Crispy, sweet and crunchy makes it a really delightful dessert to enjoy. 😎🍴👍
I felt full looking at @typicalroy_ enjoying this chocolaty goodness. Best to share this😄 #chocolatelovers #cakes #cakelovers #dessertlovers #sgcafes #burpple #openricesg \n<br />Plating by @damien_tc \n<br />Thank you taster @typicalroy_ \n<br />Photography by me😇😇
Hyde &amp; Co\'s new menu had quite a number of interesting items on it. we liked the classic combination of smoked salmon with cream cheese on a bagel. The only thing was the tough bagel that made it a challenge to eat 🌟🌟🌟
i wished I can too! few more hours till the weekend.
one of de best I\'ve eaten so far and it comes in a form on fried man tous sandwiching the tender and flavorful strips of pork.
The unique waffle/pancake creations were so attractive! We tried the Affogato (S$12) waffle which came with a house special espresso sauce and melted marshmallows. Pairing gooey marshmallows and a bittersweet syrup is such a stroke of genius. We loved the flavours!!
Pretty good coffee, lovely waffle creations - still very much average. I wouldn\'t mind a visit if I\'m around the area, but it\'s not somewhere I\'d go the extra mile for. We almost walked out 5 minutes into being seated cause the menu looked so unappealing. There\'re just that many eggs bennys and full works one can have before it all becomes stale.
new menu?
Hyde &amp; Co launches a new brunch menu this month! A departure from their former British-inspired menu, you can now expect a range of brunch and dessert items. Go for the Speedy Gonzales ($14) — braised pulled pork with housemade BBQ sauce, scrambled eggs and guacamole on a tortilla. Alternatively, get The Big Ben — toasted muffins with sauteed mushrooms, poached eggs and roasted potatoes with your choice of either bacon ($17) or smoked salmon ($21). If you like waffles, Hyde &amp; Co offers them in interesting flavours such as Butterscotch Popcorn ($14) and Affogato ($12). 
I pretty much like it a lot because they use cod instead of the usual dorry! Taste pretty yummy and the coating is just nice! Not too thick nor too thin! #burpple #rsa_minimal #onthechair #kinfolk
☕️\n<br />Latte art by yesterday guest barista @boywithhaemoglobin @zippyzipeng ! A job well done and congrats on winning the guest barista challenge! 👍🏼🙌🏻
Another one of the few new waffle dishes that Hyde &amp; Co is offering for the new brunch menu launched starting this weekend. Melted marshmallows sitting atop a crisp and fluffy waffle base, drizzle the accompanied sweet espresso sauce and enjoy slices of buttery waffles with stringy and sticky marshmallows with a tasteful tinge of bittersweet from the drizzle. A must try for those who are feeling a bit more adventurous.

Butterscotch Popcorn Waffles ($14) -  Extremely photogenic plate of crispy buttermilk waffles topped with popcorn, bananas, crushed nuts with a scoop of artisanal vanilla bean ice cream. Instead of using the usual salted caramel sauce, generous portion of homemade butterscotch sauce was drizzled over it. Love how the salty popcorn works in this dish and it is simply a perfect marriage of salty and sweet!

Really love the chilli crab pasta as it had the right amnt of spicy kick and flavours.  So is the big ben with flowy poached eggs and crispy bacon.  Love the use of muffin bun to deviate from the typical thick toast eggs benedict style. ☺👍

😌 Two more days before the launch of the new brunch menu @hydeandco!😋
almost forgot it\'s wafflicious tuesday. I hope you guys got your waffles fix!
This is easily one of my favourite waffles now, undeniably crispy and fragrant.
We tried some of the items on their new menu (available from 30th May onwards!😊) and had fun shooting them with the props provided by @medkarlek. ☺️ But now.. I think my Monday blues just got worsen looking at this. 😫 #mondayblues
it takes a great team to carry it out to perfection. 💁: my giggling partners in crime @sophiensyy &amp; @boywithhaemoglobin
Good food placement by @hydeandco doesn\'t need multiple shot, I simply give this a single shot and I love how it turns out! They\'re turning 6 months old and is launching a new brunch menu, do check them out from next week onwards and catch @lingaloy &amp; @imshaun who\'ll be your barista (only for a day) for next Sun. #burpple #sgcafe
Ah... If only this were served in the theatres along with popcorn itself— the sweet, creamy and buttery flavours form a unique combination to behold. The bits of popcorn were a little too soft though... Celebrate @HYDEANDCO\'s \'6th monthsary\' at the HYDE OUT Fiesta from 30th May to 1st June and try their new brunch menu!\n<br />#hydeandco
😌 This is worth a try, especially when I almost died under the heat today! 😂 Anw, @hydeandco is launching a new brunch menu soon! Stay tune for that!😋
A new brunch menu will be launching next week to commemorate their six monthsary! Drop by if you can! #burpple #hydeandco
Hyde &amp; Co now offers a variety of waffles as part of their new brunch menu that officially starts serving next weekend during the long weekend. One of the more innovative variations of waffles they serve would be the Butterscotch Popcorn Waffle which features homemade butterscotch sauce and artisanal vanilla ice-cream. Waffles were really crisp and buttery; indeed one of the better ones I have had and that the butterscotch sauce gave the popcorns a salty-sweet glaze, though we wished they were more generous with the sauce. Bananas and crushed nuts complimented the waffle well, adding both sweetness and nutty crunchiness to the dessert. Would be quite excited to try the Affogato variant which they are also offering on their new brunch menu launching soon.
One of the many items that Hyde &amp; Co offers now for their new brunch menu that would be launched next weekend. Personally the item that I loved the most from the tasting, the Bagel was toasted so it has this chewy yet crusty texture which pretty much makes the deal for this dish. The top bagel bun comes smothered in mayo for flavour, while the bottom one gets lined with smoked salmon with cream cheese atop. Crispy capers adds the crunch to the dish. An item that would probably come back again for at Hyde &amp; Co!
Roasted Wings smothered in a homemade BBQ sauce served with carrot celery sticks and a Buttermilk Chipotle Dip. Essentially the Roasted Wings were juicy and the sauce seemed really similar to a non-spicy version of buffalo wings, and if u do fancy the spiciness it\'s within the Buttermilk Chipotle Dip, which had this milky flavour that I did not quite fancy. Still the wings are pretty decent to have alone without the dip so it\'s worth a try.
Part of Hyde &amp; Co\'s new brunch menu that would be launched on the long weekend of Vesak Day. Crab meat tossed in housemade Arrabiata topped with herbed Panko. Loved how the pasta actually carried that spicy kick that was rather moderate, but while we could detect crabby flavours there was also a sardine-like taste lingering within.
Tomato Concasse tossed with garlic, onions and cilantro in balsamic served atop toasted baguette. Love the way the tomato\'s zesty flavours burst in the mouth, and how the onions and garlicky flavour just kicks in before it gets too sour.
Braised Pulled Pork with housemade BBQ sauce, scrambled eggs, guacamole atop tortilla. Tortilla is a tad tough, but we loved the tenderness of the pulled pork that didn\'t turn on to be too moist. Scrambled eggs were runny and creamy, and the flavours of the dish seemed pretty well balanced out.
One of the many dishes Hyde &amp; Co is offering in their new brunch menu launching next weekend. Customers have an option to choose between bacon or smoked salmon for the dish, though our tasting portion came with bacon. Eggs are well poached as they flowed brilliantly, and the roasted mushrooms were delightfully earthy. Toasted muffins was a tad doughy for certain parts, while bacon seemed a tad too salty for some. 
If I can smuggle Chir Chir KFC and this into the cinema.....I will say bye to popcorn!😂😂 Thank you Derrick and the @hydeandco team for the cosy dinner!🙆🙆 #EileenWantsToCampHere #EileenFoodTasting #burpple #pickatsg #SgCafe #CafeHop #CafeHoppingSg
Cafe ambience and deco was great! The tea, scones and dip were delicious yum yum!! It was a great experience since everything felt very high class hehehe ☺️😊
We had Adam &amp; Eve ($9.00 per pot) which is aptly name as it smells of rosemary, rose buds and rose petals with drops of caramel and hazelnuts. It\'s smooth, not bitter nor acidic like most black tea, worth a try if you\'re here. \n<br />And tea goes best with sweets, so how can we not order them. We had the Lavender Chocolate Peanut Butter cake &amp; Matcha Latte Pie ($15.80 for both). The former has smooth peanut butter cream filled with banana and drizzled with choc sauce, sadly the lavender isn\'t strong enough. Perhaps the baker had taken into consideration that not many might like a strong lavender taste. The latter was just heavenly!! Matcha and White Chocolate filling that melts in the mouth, topped with sweet meringue dollops and has a crushed cookie base, makes me want to go back for more 
at 785 North Bridge Road to check their newly launched dinner menu where each of the items including a selection of artisanal teas are specially curated to provide diners with a memorable &amp; flavorful dining experience. Hyde &amp; Co. is a cozy contemporary English-themed cafe located in the heart of the vibrant Kampung Glam precinct. \"British fare, local hands.\" // Featured here are from the starters selection; battered white bait with chili herb vinaigrette and Italian beef meatballs with spicy &amp; tangy tomato sauce.
We love the concept of a cafe-tearoom by day, and sexy bistro by night. This is beer-battered white bait with chilli-herb vinaigrette, which is so addictive you can\'t keep your hands off.
English Afternoon Tea Set ($19.90) which consists of two scones, bite-sized sandwiches and a pot of tea of your choice.The Earl Grey Tea was refreshing with a tint of flowery fragrance. In a hindsight, I felt that it was a little pricey for the light afternoon tea (served only from 3pm to 6pm) but the ambience and good service made up for it. The overall experience was pleasant and I look forward to taste their breakfast/lunch meals soon!\n<br />Full review on: http://imhaydenchan.blogspot.sg/
Hyde is also known for their wide range of tea selections. ☕️ Here\'s Lemon Curd &amp; Cream $11.90, a stack of 3 paired with luscious homemade lemon curd and cream drizzled with condensed milk. 😍 More details at jacqsowhat.com (link in bio) #shootkahliao
A visit to Hyde &amp; Co had long been overdue, and it was only today that my cafe hopping buddy and I finally made our way down to the cafe in Bugis.
Had the signature Lady Hyde and love the fusion of this dish. Love the unique flavor of this dish and how the elements complement one another. However the rather small serving portion and the long waiting time for the food might be reasons why I won\'t be back any time soon.
Lazy brunch on the day off at a new spot in our hood. Might have found a place that could give a run on our scrambled eggs at @seasonsbistro. Great recommendation on the tea from the owner. Overall two happy bellies were filled.
Paid $34 for whatever you see in this photo, worth it? :/ 
Had a Full works for $17.90, portion\'s okay but find it pretty overpriced, nice little ambience though. Wifi included!
We usually don\'t fancy marshmallows but we made a little room in our heart for this S\'mores stuffed french toast at Hyde &amp; Co.
Lady Hyde - One of signature brunch item on the menu. A good twist on the classic Croque Madame with their special Hebi Hiam sprinkled between the brioche, cheddar honey baked ham and pineapple slice. Lightly spiced, sweet and savoury combination. 
Chewy, springy, pock-marked crumpets generously drizzled with homemade lemon curd – a hit with its well-balanced sweet and zesty flavour. Finish with a cup of tea in true English style.
A little weekend brunch/lunch. I know the crumpets are supposed to be the star here, but the luscious, creamy scrambled eggs stole all the glory. 
🙊 Thank you everyone involved in making my 2014 a blast. Especially those I met thru IG, In a way or another, I\'m glad we crossed path this year. Much love to yall 🙆 With that, cheers to the frickin new year! 🍻
A pot of tea, 2 tiers of savouries and sweets and a free flow dessert table. Lovely setting with British charm and a pleasant attention to detail. We received email reminders about the reservation and directions to the cafe prior to the visit, which was a welcomed geature. The sessions today were specially arranged for Christmas and New Year but they may be introducing monthly high tea sessions soon. #hydeandco #cafehoppingsg #sgcafes #instafood #foodstagram #christmas2014 #burpple
On the side note, thanks for the Christmas gift. 😘😍❤️ counting down the days till I can open it. 😝
More than 200! An exciting year for cafe lovers. \n<br />Updated. Check out where they are at http://danielfooddiary.com/2014/09/24/cafesingapore2014
Love the pretty tea set!
Featuring The Full Works, Ball O\' Fire, Truffle Fries, Homemade Iced Lemon Tea and Rooibos Raspberry Vanilla Tea. \n<br />I had The Full Works and found the Scrambled Eggs too liquid-like and personally I don\'t fancy that. But the Rooibos Raspberry Vanilla Tea is yums!
Newly opened British-inspired cafe Hyde &amp; Co. has brought the English obsession with crumpets to Singapore. You don\'t find many places serving up these classic tea time treats, but at Hyde, expect a sizeable range of griddle cake topping options - eggs/ potatoes/ mushrooms, bacon/ ham/ smoked salmon, homemade spreads/ fruits. When in doubt, go for the Lady Hyde, their take on the classic Croque Madame, with house special hebi hiam for a more local flavour. For the sweet tooth, try their Gula Gula; gula melaka-oozing crumpets sprinkled with coconut. Don\'t forget to order that pot of tea! ;)
At least I go in and don\'t feel like coming out.
Hyde &amp; Co\'s take on the classic Croque Madame. They have incorporated local flavours such as haebee hiam into the brunch item. Loved the zesty pineapple which went well with the salty flavours of the haebee hiam, and the cheese and ham were light in taste. Pretty refreshing on the palate, though portion size is a bit small and therefore not really filling.
Hyde &amp; Co\'s signature Crumpets drenched in Gula Melaka and dessicated coconut. It seemed to resemble a crossover of a pancake and Kueh, but honestly at $12.90 a plate, it\'s just too pricey.
Despite offering a large variety of tea options, Hyde &amp; Co also offers Cold Brew coffee. The light fruity body seemed to have got covered up by the milk for this one ...
Strawberry Celebration Tea and Cold brew black(coffee beans from Bettr Barista) at this new British-inspired cafe. I\'m in love with the teapot!\n<br />Cold brew black - medium roasted beans, with chocolatey and smooth aftertaste. So far the best cold brew in my opinion.
Crumpets - a mix between English muffin and sponge cake, with coconut flakes and gula melaka that oozes out. It\'s of the right texture, sweetness and not too dry even though it looks like  the famous Hong Kong laopobing.
With mushroom confit and Norwegian crayfish tossed in Mentaiko cream, I loved how the consistency of the cream wasn’t too thick or overpowering, allowing the mushrooms &amp; crayfish to take center stage. \n<br />Topped with chives &amp; chilli flakes as well, the hint of spiciness helped to cut the creaminess down further, which was perfect for non-cream sauce lovers like me. \n<br />Much thanks to @burpple for inviting us &amp; the team at @hydeandco for your creations! •\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG
And coincidentally it was the 1st day after the cafe\'s revamp! Only realised after hoards of customers arrived subsequently. Tried the smoked salmon &amp; broccoli pizza &amp; coffee! They were good, except that they were served in disposables 😏\n<br />•\n<br />#hungrygowhere #foodblogger #foodporn #burpple #sgfood #sgeats #sgfoodies #foodie #foodsg #foodphotography #hydeandco @hydeandco #pizza #coffee #cafesg #sgcafe
Who you gonna call? Toastbusters ~
Great vibes, great food, perfect night out.
A smart fusion between Asian &amp; Italian flavors, their newest items have been done to match their new concept of take-out! \n<br />One of my favorites from tonight would be the Firecracker ($22.90) - a unique laksa haebihiam base concoction &amp; The Bomb ($13.90 for half, $26.90 for full) Pizza! With a spicy sambal chinchalok base for a pizza, you\'d be surprised at all the flavours that you\'d receive in one bite! \n<br />Thanks @burpple for inviting us along &amp; @derrickchew for sharing with us your creations! \n<br />P/S: do take note of Hyde &amp; Co\'s Ramadan opening hours! They\'re now open Tuesday nights as well! •\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG

This awesome dish really got me really excited!! Think pieces of al dente elbow pasta soaked in ever comforting Cheese and well mixed with a whole pool of SAVOURY SALTED EGG SAUCE, together with some mushrooms and shavings of spices, topped with pieces of TORCHED MENTAIKO NORWEGIAN CRAWFISH and finished with a few black caviers on top - coupled with the ambience and company, THIS IS ABSOLUTE INDULGENCE and the best dining experience I havent had in sometime. I\'ll be back for more at my new favourite #hydeout.
has officially become one of the top cafes on my list!! The food here was so good, it certainly was worth its reputation and hype! The only downside to it was the price, but it certainly was worth every cent. Pre-CA1 food therapy went pretty well with an awesome bunch, at our new #secrethydeout

Sharp taste at first with the berry tea, but after mixing it around a little I think the mint and other ingredients kicked in for a refreshing beverage 🍹 #ngiamyeats #burpplesg #burpple \n<br />#sgcafes #sgcafefood #whywhiteworks #whati8today #whiteaddict #whiteaddicted #8dayseats #snapseed #chasinglight #minimalove #minimalmood #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #tablesituation #onthetableproject #sgfoodies

Meat so tender and lying on a bed of sweet potato mash and purple cabbage for added crunch. My favorite dish for the dinner tasting😄 #dinnerwithfriends #tasting #sgfoodies #burpple #openricesg #foodstagram #nomnom #i8mondays #8dayseat @hungrygowhere \n<br />A hosted meal by @hydeandco

Love the texture; tender, juicy shredded pork, fresh crunchy coleslaw, crisp mantou bun.
Excellent art, average taste.
// Cooked in coconut water and finished off in coconut cream, the risotto bears a stark resemblance to the usual hawker delicacy, except it\'s way better...with plumper grains and more finesse in the finished product. Crowned with a bit of lemon zest overhead to whet the appetite; spicy prawns and crispy ikan bilis complete the deft equation。
aside, do you know that hyde is having an anniversary menu on the 26/27 nov, do check them out!
Especially the slight chewiness of the waffle batter and the big swashes of salted caramel sauces that so conveniently fills up those sweet crevices. Crack pie... This is still in the works though so it won\'t be available till Dec。
Burnt cauliflower on the side adding novelty factor while a good dash of lime overhead brings life to the spicy concoction below。\n<br />～～～～～～\n<br />#whati8today #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood #instafood_sg #burpple #hydeandcosg #hungrygowhere #singaporeinsiders #sipandgulp #eyecandysorted #igsg #sgfoodporn
Drizzled with Butterscotch sauce •

New on the menu. Ondeh has a soft texture and moist enough with a wonderful gula melaka and coconutty sweet taste. Rose lychee had a soft texture but somewhat dry. 5 of us voted for the ondeh....hands down! #ondehondeh #roselychee #newitem #cafehopping #cafesg #burpple #opensnapeats #i8mondays #8dayseat #cakes #cakelovers @hydeandco
Smells good and taste of Lychee + Rose was distinctive too. Buttercream wasn\'t too sweet, cake texture was slight crumbly but overall I still enjoy eating it.
Pulled pork mantou. Pork is tender but alittle sweet. Prefer the sweetnessto be toned down #mantou #pork #cafehopping #cafesg #sgfoodie #bloggerssg #brunch #opensnapeats #nomnom #burpple #i8mondays #8dayseat @8days_eat @hungrygowhere #hoppingwithfriends @hydeandco
Eggs poached properly with a good dousing of Hollandaise sauce atop a pair of toasted English muffins and bacon. \n<br />Hyde &amp; Co, North Bridge Road, Singapore

Spicy enough for me. 🍝
A little late but jumping on the #bandwagon here with this #Singaporean localized #PulutHitam #waffle from #hydeandco! Exciting flavors we\'ve got indeed. \n<br />Waffles were fabulous! My only wish was that the pulut hitam was a little softer as there were some grains that were quite hard. Nevertheless we enjoyed this!
Awesome waffles ...
Less negativity, more positive thoughts every one!
😂\n<br />Blessed Tuesday.
Affogato waffles! 👍🏻
Pulled pork mantou, Chilli crab linguine ! 👍🏻
Truffle fries , Big Ben in both Smoked Salmon and Crispy Bacon! 👍🏻
Definitely going back again 
-\n<br />On the table: {Speedy Gonzalaes} and {The Big Ben} , the former a sumptuous feast of slow braised 6hr pulled pork, creamy scrambled eggs in a tortilla shell. || It\'s short fall: BBQ sauce thats just a little too saucy, resulting a large pool of juices gathered at the bottom of the plate. 😖 = soggy tortilla. And if I might add, a little more guacamole and pico de gallo for that Mexican fiesta please！
Grin and B E A R with it！
OMG ... This butterscotch waffle is so yummzz
I would advice sticking with ham over smoked salmon for a more cohesive dish。
// I have a good mind to try the pancakes next。

Thanks @yixinnnnnn for the great company and for bringing me to the musical today! 😙🙆
Belgian waffles with pulut hitam (black glutinous rice), a dollop of vanilla ice 🍧cream &amp; generous sprinkling of toasted almonds and 🌴coconut cream. Waffles was crispy. If the pulut hitam was a teeny weeny bit sweeter, it will be tastier😄😄#waffles #wafflelovers #teabreak #teawithfriends #sgblogger #cafesg #burpple #openricesg #rice #instafollow @hydeandco

I think this dish would be better off as a pulled pork dip with breadsticks. It was too hard to bite as a whole sandwich and almost impossible to cut with a knife and fork... personally i find the meat too sweet for my taste, i was expecting it to be on the savoury side.
Everything is white colour with just hints of colour in a random apron hanging on the wall. Too bad I haven\'t had the chance for a afternoon tea session here. So I\'m here for lunch.  My fair lady is one of their specialty tea with hints flowery herbs(hisbicus, rose and one more) #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare

The taste of the mushroom jam is prominent in the eggs ben and enhances its overall flavour. Serving is quite small though. #ketohloh #8DAYSEat #burpple

Wonderful platter that\'s worth sharing with a friend or two— serves as a satisfying appetizer. Looooove the plating on this! :) #hydeandco

Morning\'s break during the calligraphy workshop - most delightful English scones and French earl grey tea with Chantilly cream &amp; jam. This made mummy really happy 😍 
Working on a new food post that\'s gonna be up soon!😜
Have a Salmon Sunday! 🍴
I loved the vintage teapot and also the soothing tea.
They ran out of crumpets 😟

Disappointing and the portion is really small for 1
A cafe that is unique and knows exactly what concept they wanted to bring. Satisfied customer, will definitely be back for more. 
Gotten the gula gula &amp; balls of fire crumpets!
Fluffy crumpets with lemon curd!
IDEK (i don\'t even know) why there must be so many names for pancakes. Either way this is amazing &amp; i\'ll definitely heed the lady boss\' advice to try the gula melaka one next time!
