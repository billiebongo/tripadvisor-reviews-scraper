Savoury from the Crispy Bacon that adds a much needed saltiness alongside the acidity of Braised Green Apples, marries the Flavours Harmoniously Together. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: If Savoury French Toast isn\'t your cup of tea &amp;/or you\'re a sweet tooth, Ronin offers a Sweet Alternative that comes with Berry Compote, Honey Mascarpone &amp; Pistachio Crumbles. 🖖🏻
Was craving for granola but refused to fork out $10 for a bowl since I was in a rush, so I settled for this banana bread ($4) and a cup of flat white ($5+). Even after all these while, Ronin is still one of the best cafes around. The banana bread was moist, with hints of baked bananas and walnuts - a party in the mouth! The coffee needs no introduction. The chillax vibes here makes it a great weekend brunch option.
Been looking forward to visit this place for awhile already. Heard their scrambled eggs are really good, &amp; decided to come down to try it! 
Think of this as a melted down version added in mocha. The hint of orange hits you in a way that you are reminded of its subtle presence. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: I\'d recommend this ever so slightly more than their Wicked (Peppermint Mocha) \n<br />It\'s a refreshing take on the usual run the in the mill mocha, I also don\'t recall any/many cafes offering Orange Mocha. It always remind me of the Chocolate Bar. 🖖🏻
SOOOO GOOOOD! Its brioche french toast w braised apple, bacon, hazelnut butter &amp; syrup. Its very filling and more of a savoury kind of french toast so it wont be too sweet for the morning! Mad love!!
Had this for breakfast and it was so filling! The eggs are a bit expensive imo, but its worth a try because the texture is good, its smooth and creamyn, and accompanied with the bread
.\n<br />\"The Silkiest Scrambled Eggs I\'ve ever Had!\"\n<br />.\n<br />\"Accept no other Substitutes.\" .\n<br />\"What?! You haven\'t been to Ronin for their Scrambled Eggs?! You are missing out!\"\n<br />.\n<br />These are what I got from most of my friends before I head to Ronin. So it kinda pushed my expectation for its Scrambled Eggs Sky High. Verdict? 🍴\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS💮: It\'s definitely one of the better Scrambled Eggs, Buttery, Fluffy, Silky &amp; even a little Pillowy I\'d dare say. But is it really the Best in town? It\'s a huge claim, to me it\'s not. But everyone\'s expectation &amp; taste is different, so head down &amp; give it a try. Then decide for yourself if it deserves the accolade. 🖖🏻
Ronin - Drink - Genovese Coffee - Wicked (Hot/Cold) (💵S$6/S$8) Ronin\'s Signature Minted Mocha ☕️\n<br />•\n<br />This much raved about drink combines Chocolate, Coffee &amp; Peppermint.

Just give me my typical Kopitiam Uncle or Aunty La Kopi Gu Yu anytime, made using the Sock! 🖖🏻
Creamy and buttery, this is what you would want in your scrambled eggs. With just a speck of salt and pepper is all that you need to enjoy this egg-cellent experience with a few slices of seeded and sourdough toast. Up the ante with an additional side of bacon. To complete the meal, do remember to order their renowned WICKED, a peppermint mocha latte that\'s done with perfectly.\n<br />•\n<br />RONIN\n<br />Address: 17, Hongkong Street, Singapore 059660\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #ronin_sg

With bacon, apples, maple syrup and hazelnut butter which was a nice touch. A lil pricey at $16 though. 
Minty mocha. Really nice and comforting. Tastes more chocolate than coffee though.
While sister concept PUNCH draws in the crowd with its laidback vibes and Instagrammable backyard, it\'s RONIN that checks off all the boxes on our Best Cafes list. The hard-to-find storefront along Hong Kong Street, the dimly lit space and the lack of menus (there\'s only one hanging on the wall to refer to) doesn\'t seem to faze our Burpple community — and it shouldn\'t stop you either! Seating is limited, so swing by for brunch with a small group of friends. As evident on every table, you should go for the beautifully made Scrambled Eggs on Toast ($9) — creamy, velvety folds of egg with a dash of coarse sea salt flakes, served on two types of toast. Add on portobello mushroom ($3.50) and avocado ($3) for a more substantial meal. The French Toast ($15) with braised apples, crispy bacon and hazelnut butter (so darn good) is also by far one of the best in town. Don\'t leave without a cup of Wicked Mocha ($5.50/$7.50 for iced) — coffee with a heap of peppermint chocolate for a minty finish.\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua
Imagine: thick yet soft brioche, shallowly browned with egg dip, topped with generous dollop of honey-flavoured mascarpone cream, drizzle of fruit compote and spread of nutty crumble. This is what we had at Ronin.  One of the best around!!
Served with a sprig of mint leaf, this drink is, truly, WICKED.
Finally get to try the brunch here~ 😋 Add on portobello mushroom [$3.50] + Bacon [$4]
If you a person who like to sit in the dark with noise around you. This will be the perfect place for you. Once you enter the cafe, you will not know whether is day or night. 
This has got to be the silkiest scrambled eggs I\'ve ever had! Buttery, silky, add on those juicy mushrooms and here\'s a breakfast that will never let you down.
Nothing beat a comforting plate of sandwich of Prosciutto and Brie. The melted cheese and saltiness of the ham is simply beautiful. Great for a hangover, I reckon, although many may think that it\'s not intense enough. The lightly, peppered tomatoes, and the fresh basil is enough to keep you going.
Peppermint Mocha and coffee were decent but what really impressed me was that coffee art. Kudos to the amazingly talented baristas behind the counter! I\'m not one who usually cares for art on my coffee but this, this I had to appreciate for a full minute before drinking.
This is where the eggs are disguised as silk. And every bite of it makes me want weep with joy.
They have upped the price but so did the portion; 3 humongous slabs of fluffy egg-soaked toast with seared apples and loads of bacon (albeit slightly burnt). Truly satisfying!
Light minted mocha great balance. Matcha is creamy and nice. 100 marks for looks
Nice decor, good sandwiches. Very lively and crowded during Saturday brunch.
Glorious scoot of vanilla ice cream sitting on a hot pool of espresso. So good.
Very quaint place. There wasn\'t much in their menu but i decided to give their well-known french toasts a try. The bacon was tender as well as the french toasts and the apples were quite sweet! I would rate it 7/10
If you are a lover of the salty and sweet duo, you\'ll seriously fall in love with this syrupy goodness with crispy bacon ❤️
I was definitely sold upon the first bite. The refreshingly sour braised granny smith apple gave me a much-needed break from the sweet syrup while the bacon gloriously boasted its savoury reign over the dish. And that hazelnut butter smoothly elevated the flavour of the toast without being too overwhelming. I was rather surprised to read some people commented the presence of the apple to be \"out-of-place\" because I personally thought the apples set this french toast apart from other french toasts around. And yes, \"it\'s so fluffy I\'m going to die\"!
This morning my breakfast at my fave cafe, Ronin. Had mint mocha and cappuccino since we ordered so much food! 😆 I love the simple scrambled eggs and wilted spinach on sourdough toast. The scrambled eggs are the best that I have eaten so far. Simple but really tasty. For something more explosive go for the Dirty Ronin sandwich. Explosive because the unassuming sandwich surprises you with a mixture of spicy, salty taste of  miso mayo, chorizo, cheese and egg! It\'s my fave sandwich now. You can\'t find it anywhere but here in Ronin. The savoury French toast with bacon and braised Apple is another of my fave. Love the fluffy toast with the hazelnut butter. Usually I will order the pork sausage to go with it. A slice of the toast with hazelnut butter+braised Apple+pork sausage+the maple sauce sent into your mouth! Oooh.... Heavenly!! Love the savoury and sweet combo! #whatclariceloves #mynumber1cafe #mustvisiteveryweek #regularcustomer 
If you want something different, try the lamb sausage. 😋👍The main Eggs on Toast dish costs S$10, and the sausage option an additional S$5. The incredible part about the scrambled eggs at Ronin Cafe is the seasoning and the taste. On your first bite there is this super shiok feeling where the fragrance from the eggs simply explodes in your mouth. \n<br />Full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/07/04/ronin-cafe-delicious-scrambled-eggs-and-french-toast/ (active link at bio)

The bacon goes exceptionally well with the french toast, hazelnut butter and syrup. This makes a good choice if you\'re craving something sweet yet filling. 😉
No visible signage, no physical menu, no records made for orders. The atmosphere here is definitely very different from the typical Singapore cafe. \n<br />Featuring their Dirty Ronin Sandwich, Scrambled Eggs on Toast with Sausage and hot Wicked drink.\n<br />See the full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/07/04/ronin-cafe-delicious-scrambled-eggs-and-french-toast/ (active link at bio)
Nice cafe with dimmed lights! Perfect ambiance for a hideout. Do order their scrambled eggs with toast! Eggs are cooked to perfection texture 😊 Pork sausage add on compliments the dish
(7.3/10) only downside was that they flatly refused to change their famous wicked mocha coffee to a non coffee mint hot chocolate. 😪 still worth a return visit though.
The crew at Ronin sure make a sick Iced Wicked. \n<br />6.5bucks/iced latte\n<br />7.5bucks/iced wicked\n<br />#FTrecommends
\nLike the quiet librarian who\'s a whip-cracking dominatrix behind closed doors, you can\'t judge this sandwich by appearance. Efficiently compressed into a tidy thing, its understated looks is anything but. An unsuspecting first bite is the pin-pull to a spicy, salty explosion of chorizo, miso mayo and cheese, with a bit of egg and lettuce mixed in. Stunning. 
Now that\'s a first! Loved the fluffy eggy toast, and it came topped with bacon and stewed apples. Interesting contrast of flavours, and for those who have an even sweeter tooth, there\'s the sweet version too #brunch #latelunch #cafehoppingsg #burpple #foodporn #foodspotting
Never mind the lack of menus (there\'s only one hanging on the wall to refer to) and the unassuming storefront, Ronin is still the go-to cafe for many simply because the food is good and the coffee is consistent. Opened by the folks behind The Plain and PUNCH, this moody, industrial chic cafe is perfect for brunch with a small group of friends. Like the regulars here, go for the outrageously good Scrambled Eggs on Toast ($9) — creamy, velvety folds of egg with a dash of coarse sea salt flakes, served on two types of toast. Choose to add portobello mushroom ($3.50) and avocado ($3) for a heartier meal. The French Toast ($15) with braised apples, crispy bacon and hazelnut butter (so darn good) is by far one of the best in town. Don\'t leave without a cup of Wicked Mocha ($5.50/$7.50 for iced) — coffee with a heap of chocolate and a minty finish.
My classic brunch: simple yet satisfying. With a side of portobello mushrooms, it just pulls the entire dish together. The eggs were well-scrambled and creamy, and it goes so well with the softened buttered multigrain toast. Something about the ambience at Ronin is really calming. A cafe doesn\'t always need to have wifi to be an awesome place to think or just chill out. 😌
The tables at Ronin\' cafe were mostly occupied even on a weekday during brunch hours. Loved the quaint and unpretentious space. Had the good ol\' eggs on toasts with avo on the side ($13) always love a simple meal, although I was rather disappointed the yolks were overcooked and weren\'t runny. Be sure to try their \"wicked\" coffee, which tasted a lot like after8 chocolate!
The food is great! Will visit again to try other dishes!
Holy moly batman! There\'s a scoop of ice cream on my toast!
This time monster finally took some nice shots at the darkest cafe that has one of Monster\'s favorite drink. \n<br />Wicked!
Pretty amazing coffees here. This is their signature wicked mocha. It is a mint mocha actually, so pretty I almost couldn\'t bear to drink it. This is good for those who don\'t like a strong coffee taste. ($5.80/$7.80 for iced). 
The drink that caught my attention and got me mesmerized. Yes, my friends, I proudly proclaim that the Wicked ($5.50) is my favourite cup to cure my coffee fix.
Creamy and \"slurppery\" good, this is the perfect brunch of Scrambled Eggs on Toast ($9) with add-on of a giant portobello mushroom ($3.50). Nothing else comes close yet to breaking my eggy affair with Ronin Cafe.
Found this little cafe while googling for some nice place to eat. BF and I ordered same dish with both our favorite scrambled egg on toast and mushroom along with a pork sausage. Ice coffee and ice wicked. Hmmm delicious 😆😆😆
Had the scrambled eggs on toast ($10 for just toast and eggs) with the savoury French toast. The French toast ($15) was a winner with a great combination of flavours, the sweet and slightly salty French toast, paired with back bacon, and a poached apple which provided a good tang to neutralise the richness of it.
By the folks behind The Plain and PUNCH, this bustling, dimly-lit cafe is THE place to go for Scrambled Eggs on Toast ($9). Thoughtfully served with two different types of toast and perfectly executed every single time, the scrambled eggs are luscious, creamy and velvety, and sprinkled with just the right amount of sea salt flakes. Choose to add the avocado, bacon, or portobello mushroom should you need a big breakfast! Finish with the Iced Wicked Mocha ($7.50) — pure chocolatey goodness with a minty finish.
Haven\'t been here for so long - too long, and this is one place I\'m so glad the menu hasn\'t changed!! Savoury French Toast is as good and fluffy as I remembered, with a killer hazelnut butter, braised apple and of course, bacon. Bacon makes the world a better place. Perfect morning with just me and my favorite Wicked cuppa - minty, chocolatey, mild hint of coffee. This is how you know it\'s gonna be a good day 🙌🏼 
Coffee helps you to work better, remember to grab one before heading to work/school! 😉
A constant for brunch and coffee. I\'ve been here every now and then since they opened, and I\'ve never felt any less than completely satisfied. Scrambled eggs are always silky smooth, rich and creamy; toast is always well-buttered and flavourful; and every side I\'ve ever ordered is always done well. I know they are sisters with The Bravery; but somehow the latter never seemed to impress. Ronin\'s still the place I\'d recommend to those who\'d like a consistent, fail-safe spot for breakfast fare.
Finally here at Ronin but was mad crowded and got shifted to a dim spot. Here\'s their signature iced minted mocha $7.50. Scrambled eggs on toast and brioche French toast were decent.
Coffee is perfect at Ronin, not the bitter sort. On a hot day a minty mocha is a sure hit.
Incidentally my first cup of Wicked (Hot - $5.50), a well balanced cup of coffee, chocolate and peppermint that is so easy to drink. Non-coffee people will also love this drink as the coffee taste is really subtle.
also bout damn time i try ronin too. ambience and coffee is jus dope. p.s: these days, i like seeing finished stained cups
Grilled apples, sweet bacon and knob of hazelnut butter. Standard has dropped a little (slightly mushy on the inside, perhaps not fried through) since the last time i was here but still 😍
Mmm. Rich chocolate is used to make this decadent drink but with the perfect amount of peppermint, it\'s balanced and not too jelat. Amazing on a rainy day in December, especially with Christmas on the way!
Mainstay on Ronin\'s menu consisting of chorizo, gruyere (YES), soft egg, miso mayo and lettuce. The mayo and soggy lettuce somewhat cheapen the sandwich (reminiscent of catered tea buffets) 
Peppermint mocha is still as good as i remember!! Amazing for the cold rainy Sunday that it was
Warm yellow lights makes the place really cosy (and also really good for photos) to just hangout and have a nice chat with friends. The drinks and French toast also really delish.
Woke up to a cold cold morning and nothing would be more perfect that sipping on a hot green tea latte from Ronin. Probably the prettiest green tea latte there is, this two toned beauty tastes as good as it looks. And because of the lack of green tea powder, there wasn\'t any powdery feeling when you reach the bottom of the cup, which I very much preferred.
Make yours a \"Wicked Float\" with an additional scoop of vanilla icecream for an extra two bucks. I\'d take one any day! 🙋🏻 7.5bucks/ Iced Wicked (+2bucks for i/c)\n<br />5.5bucks/ Hot Wicked\n<br />#FTrecommends

I\'m not very big on brioche being used for French toast to be honest - I like French toast to be chewy, livened from its stale state. But here it\'s the companions - especially a tart, lively braised apple - that shine.
Need a cup of iced chocolate now!\n<br />Perfect for this hot weather, Ronin Cafe\'s Iced Chocolate is rich and thick, not too milky (but you have to mix the chocolate sauce well).
A sudden urge kicked in when I was here even though I wasn\'t very into having a brownie; a subconscious feeling that I might be missing out on something that had been widely raved about on social media not too long ago. Indeed, this was a pleasure to have without being overly dry; came with a crackly top and just when you think that the chocolate gets overpowering, the sea salt cuts in just in a nick of time to balance out those flavours. Definitely something I will order yet again if I am here the next time.
I used to go ewwwwwww at matcha but this beauty changed me. 😍
They serve pretty good (wicked) coffees too!👍 @ HongKong Street📍••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n<br />🚇Nearest Station: Clarke Quay, Exit E
Added on a pork sausage, portobello and avocado. You know how many big breakfasts just get a little tiring after a while, or how you start to feel you could\'ve made it at home? Certainly not this plate. So much care in every ingredient, from just the right amount of sea salt flakes on your gently scrambled eggs, to the herbs on your juicy portobello, and the pepper and lemon on your avocado. 
What\'s truly enticing about a good French toast is a balance of salty and sweet, and the one at Ronin totally nails it with their Brioche French Toast ($14.50) with braised apple, crispy bacon, hazelnut butter and syrup. This rendition is close to flawless in every way, but its the innocent pat of hazelnut butter that adds a depth as it melts into liquid gold and becomes one with the syrup.The back bacon is just salty enough to offset the sweetness, and is a nice crispy contrast to the soft braised apples. You wouldn\'t want to share this. As always, be sure to have a coffee here — a long black is perfect with this sweet treat!
A hearty brunch for \'Monday me time\' at the Ronin Cafe || The smooth, fluffy and creamy scrambled eggs were of course the highlight but with the add ons is what I would call Brunch for Champions. Well-seasoned, this dish is a must have when you visit the cafe. (note: don\'t over order like I did)
Their signature coffee\'s delicious; tastes like a cuppa minty hot chocolate. #ronincafe @ Hong Kong Street ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n<br />🚇Nearest Station: Clarke Quay
Visited Ronin yesterday for lunch. Ordered my favorite brioche french toast and cold Wicked aka ice mocha. Requested for the syrup for the French toast to be served separately. This is how I like to eat my toast - thick fluffy toast+apple+pork sausage and dip in the syrup! Yummy!! Next time I will request for the bacon to be replaced with the pork sausage... Then it will be the perfect toast! 👍🏻😄✌🏼️😋
Love the space, love the mood, love the wicked and of course their scrambled eggs too! 
Ronin\'s my go-to place for consistently reliable and stunning all-day brunch. A great - possibly the best - scramble, well-roasted portobello, beautifully charred sausages, crisp bacon, and generously buttered toasts - I\'m in brunch heaven. The food\'s awesome, the coffee\'s stellar, and the staff are amazing. What\'s not to like?
Have been thinking of this Ang moh breakie for the whole week! Glad I came to Ronin to have my craving satisfied! Yummy!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Finally here! Am glad I came. The thick and fluffy French toast is really good. Next time I will order an extra pork sausage to go with it!! Love it!! Happy tummy!! Totally worth the calories!! 👍🏼
Both are wickedly good!! Wicked to the core but I love them!! 😁
Ordered their thick toast which was so filling! The scramble eggs was really good and for some reason, the food made me feel right at home. Finish off with their signature mint latte. Ps: just a note, they only accept cash. 
A cafe with great ambience, for chilling and just simply catching up with friends. The dishes served are simple, probably a little overpriced. Nonetheless the coffee &amp; food are great :)
Under the recommendation of the server, I had their Japanese curry rice.  It was topped with raw egg yolk and it complemented the curry sauce when mixed together👍. The beef pieces were very tender! It would be better if they served up bigger portion of the meat. Expect to share table with other diners when it is packed, good place to chill, downside would be that the mains/drinks are rather pricey. But fret not, they do provide complimentary plain water :) 💰CASH payment only
Texture of omelette was smooth and to my liking 😄 I enjoyed the iced matcha too! The sides eg. Avocado, mushroom etc were a lil too pricey. 
Can\'t wait for the WICKED weekend to come.
One thing\'s for sure, Ronin serves staggeringly good scrambled eggs. Voluminous and silkily creamy with the crunchy spark of sea salt, I am always in awe of their sensuousness. My preference is to have the eggs with bacon and avocado 😋
Super creamy, perfect scrambled eggs. The best I\'ve had thus far in cafes. Buttered toasts goes well with it, the portobello mushroom (which could be done better) made it a complete meal to start the day right. 
An eggs-and-toast kinda day. And who can resist a plump, juicy sausage and salty bacon? Certainly not I!
Had Ronin\'s signature Peppermint Mocha which looked gorgeous as well as tasted great.
Cosy cafe to chill with friends. French toast was good. Coffee was alright. Fast service.  Food: 8/10, Coffee: 6/10, Ambience: 9/10
Mocha with minted flavor on it. The mint bring out something different, worth the try.
Picked lamb sausage, with a slice of country Swiss and sourdough...
I like this corner of cbd where I can get away from the crowd. Free my mind from the numbers and finance talk. Dim lights, good coffee, awesome scrambled eggs and OMG the brioche french toast (so softttt!). 
Brioche French Toast x stewed Apple x butter x bacon- just think of eggy &amp; fluffy tost with a good  Apple pie filling and bacon which gives a good savory and sweet combi. The minted mocha is interesting, however the mint flavour which tasted like peppermint favouring was abit overpowering.
It\'s lack of a distinct shopfront doesn\'t stop the crowds from flocking to Ronin for excellent coffee and unpretentious food. Opened by the good folks behind The Plain and The Bravery, pop into this dimly-lit, no-nonsense cafe for some legit scrambled eggs on toast (add on that juicy portobello mushroom and bacon for good measure) and the well-loved Dirty Ronin sandwich. Do yourself a favour and get the decadent brioche French toast topped with braised apple, bacon, hazelnut butter and syrup -- you won\'t regret it. Of course, no brunch is complete without a kick of caffeine from their classic brews. If you feel like something different, go for their Matcha Latte, or cool down on a hot day with a Wicked!
Coming with Braised Apple, Bacon, Hazelnut Butter and Syrup, there are as many similarities to differences against the one served at The Lokal which isn\'t too far away. Remembered having this one at RONIN when they were still new and recalled being impressed by it; the soft poached apples, the crisp bacon that has some pulling tension and the hazelnut butter that was buttery yet chocolatey in its nutty nature. Both The Lokal\'s version and RONIN\'s rendition are winners, with The Lokal\'s version winning the sweet-tooths over with its caramel sweetness while RONIN\'s appealing to purist who love tasting different elements of the dish by itself.
Ronin is tucked within Hong Kong street that some can\'t even find it coz there isn\'t a signboard! I went there twice. First, just for a cup of coffee and it was so awesome that I have to go back again. The second trip back, we had brunch and my friend was singing praises on their coffee. Brunch was good though the service was rather slow as it was quite crowded.
For those who love fluffy French toasts with bacon, look no further! $14.50 gets you a pretty awesome one and not to mention it comes with BACON 😍
So I popped by for a quiet lunch on my own earlier today and as I was taking photos of my glorious French toast like any conscientious, diligent Burppler/iPhotograher/food-obsessed Instagrammer would, these two girls sitting right next to me started talking in no hushed tones about what they think of people who take photos of their food. Obviously their condescending comments were meant to be heard by me, though I merely brushed off their grating ABC accents (only applicable to them because of what they were saying) as I would mosquitoes buzzing in my ear, and went on to enjoy what I had come for: the food. Seriously, people who love to eat (and take photos of our nosh) are the best people ever cos we really don\'t give a shit about anything except having a good meal and posting pretty photos depicting it.\n<br />And thankfully this triplet of fluffy brioche covered in egg was such heaven to my tastebuds, a slab of luscious hazelnut butter melding seamlessly with the lashings of syrup lavishly poured over soft poached apples and smoky back bacon.\n<br />Ahhhh, too blessed to be stressed by meaningless fools. 
It\'s probably been only a week since I last visited, but I\'m already missing their French Toast so bad. Eggy fluffy buttery brioche, braised apples, salty caramelised bacon, hazelnut composed butter - all doused in amazing syrup. The balance of sweet and salty, soft and crispy, was so perfect #idonteven
I don\'t like my eggs scrambled, so I\'ve never tried the famed ones at Ronin. Visited with my sisters and found their Scrambled eggs on toast with Portobello mushroom ($12.50) an absolute joy. Creamy delicious eggs, perfectly grilled cap of portobello, and crisp buttered toast. At this rate imma head to Ronin everyday!
Never really heard of this being served at RONIN so decided why not just get it! Honestly I am more than just impressed; this humble looking bite sized pastry was just as crumbly as your tausarpiah, and encasing grounded black sesame that held well within which was exuding black sesame aroma. Pretty decent if you are looking for a light bite with your coffee!
Top layered with steamed milk and bottom layer is filled green match powder. This dark jade colour drink is pretty to look at and nice to drink too. Smooth texture and just the right sweetness without any lingering matcha aftertaste, you will find yourself craving for more.
A small cosy, dimly lit up coffeee joint that serves simple fares. ..
Winding down the weekend with brunch at Ronin. Absolutely loved their food and drinks. Definitely one of my favorite cafes to chill and have a good time.
I went to Ronin for this and was greatly disappointed. Went because I\'ve seen the reviews by some burpplers. But what I got looked totally different from theirs. Too milky and too sweet. What\'s worst is when I mentioned it, they just dismiss in the manner like I was talking rubbish. 😒 Probably won\'t visit again because of this. 
This dish is awesome, love it but ain\'t cheap thou..
This coffee has too much mint, maybe I\'m not use to it..
Instantenously fell in love with the wicked one. Don\'t be deceived by a single mint leaf cos the taste of mint was intense.
It you have a thing for peppermint, this is worth a try. Love its bracing taste in a thick, icy-cold mocha of evenly balanced chocolate and coffee.  
Beautiful to look at and so darn good to drink. The deep jade-coloured \"matcha\" (green tea) at the base of the cup, has been mixed beforehand with a little sweetness. So when you sip at it, the \"matcha\" travels through the frothy milk to fill your senses with delight. 
Chopped walnuts invade this banana loaf like brave warriors waging war against the banana in there. So you get lots of crunchy texture throughout which keeps it interesting. The size is quite big too; definitely worth the $4.
This coffee is fantastic, first time try out such a unique taste of coffee. Price is reasonable $5.50, the coffee place is pretty cozy too.
Hidden among the traditional trading firms and hostels along Hong Kong Street is Ronin, yet another one of those ever-popular industrial chic cafes but with a tinge of Japanese influence (I have yet to come across another cafe that sells Japanese curry rice). Their coffee was strong and aromatic, but a lot less acidic than most strong coffees I have tasted. And though I\'m not a big fan of this type of coffee (yet), I can\'t say it\'s not good either. My friend and I wanted to order a small dessert, but were disappointed to find very limited choices available at the counter. In the end, we settled on a Salted Caramel Brownie, of which I\'m rarely disappointed by anything that is salted caramel. Unfortunately, the brownie turned out to be too wet for our liking, and was basically a wet mush on our plate by the time we decided we had enough of it (and by the way I don\'t usually leave anything behind on my plate) Worth commending is the service we received from the young waitress at the cashier. Unfortunately, with their not so attractive menu, this cafe might not be seeing much of me unless I happen to be in the vicinity again. 
Afternoon brunch and catch up session at the awesome Ronin cafe! The scrambled eggs on toast with additional pork sausage is done just right.
Loved the fragility of the egg yolk but that was pretty much it
Scrambled eggs on 2 types of toast, gourmet lamb sausage and portobello mushroom.  And awesome coffee!
Not bad though. 👍 taste is just nice! Scramble egg is milky and fluffy. Love the portobello mushroom! Huge and nicely seasoned. Sausage is not too salty as well, love the multigrain toast too! #burpple
Lunch earlier with @anythingalsoeat, feat. the gloriously fluffy scrambled eggs, #avocado and toast.
😁🙆\n<br />Salada x Brioche French Toast x Scrambled Eggs on Toast x Fungi sandwich\n<br />#burpple
Crispy bacon topped on the syrup toast.\n<br />Salty + sweet = just nice!
Can\'t wait for the weekends to arrive.
Crusty toasties sandwiched with eggs, comte cheese, miso mayo, and chorizo. One of my favorite sandwiches other than the French Toast at Ronin. 
scrambled eggs ŵ avocado, sausage &amp; portobello. love the food here! #sgfood \n<br />no more brunching on weekdays 😔
Chorizo, gruyere, soft egg, miso mayo, lettuce. This was really delicious and worth the $13 price given the portion. Would have preferred if the yolk was more runny though.  
Wicked mocha was really good reminded me of the white mint sweet with chocolate center. Can get pretty heavy after a while, iced version may be better 
Decent coffee and cheaper than most cafes! Not too crowded on a Sunday afternoon 👍
Iced matcha and iced minted mocha. The kind of place where you\'ll just keep going back. 
Ordered their scrambled eggs on toast and add on pork sausage and portobello mushroom.
A nice cuppa perk me up.
I\'m back at this hipster cafe on a weekday. Trying their matcha latte this time round, fell kinda flat for me. But food and ambience compensated for that. My weekend officially started!
Runny creamy scrambled eggs
Yet another hipster cafe explored today. A place for hipsters to be seen hanging and chilling on a weekend. The wicked-mint mocha is one of their specialty, a refreshing new coffee flavor. 
Usual bugbear of not being able to take our time (but at least the staff asked nicely) like everywhere else, but at least the food and coffee here were okay. Will be back to try the brownie, apparently it’s good.
This is unbelievable even when it\'s not the first time we are having it.
Thin stack of roast beef on brie cheese with a layer of rocket and pickles sandwiched on 2 pieces of toast, simple!Simply delicious : ) 
浪人咖啡... \\Ro\"nin\"\\, noun: In Japan, under the feudal system, a samurai who had renounced his clan or who had been discharged or ostracized and had become a wanderer without a lord; an outcast; an outlaw.
A place that lives up to its name/review! The scrambled eggs are really nice and the portobello mushroom is huge! 
French toast with braised apple, bacon and hazelnut maple syrup - unique combination. Pretty appetizing but a little too sweet towards the end. Good for sharing though. The mocha was minted, chocolate was too overpowering, tasted more like a chocolate drink rather than a coffee BUT then I\'m not saying that it\'s bad. You\'ll probably like it if you like chocolate, just that it doesn\'t satisfy my coffee cravings. To justify my actions - you\'ve to order the specialty when you\'re there right???? I\'ll definitely be back but it\'s too dark over there to take a pretty photo!!!
Tastes like Christmas. 
A luxurious rendition with the fluffiest, eggiest toast unabashedly soaked with maple syrup and topped with a pad of hazelnut butter (my favourite part). This is my third time having it and i still think it\'s the best french toast in town.
But we decided to be greedy and add on portobello mushroom ($3.50) and pork sausage ($4.50)! Was a bit shocked when the bill came as we weren\'t expecting the add-ons to be priced so exorbitantly.. &gt;.
You\'ll have to know how to find this cafe and ask the staff what they are serving today! Anyway, the friendly staff recommended the roast beef sandwich. Kinda dry but love the sweet japanese pickles inside! :)
Always a delight. French toast with just the right amount of honey, apples, while topping it of with some flavorful bacon. It\'s a beautiful combination.
Straightforward. No pretense.
Well balanced coffee, retaining the original coffee taste. Details: www.bitesbakesandstays.wordpress.com
Huge portion of eggs, different types of bread, added mushroom. Great first bite but gets overwhelming. Details: www.bitesbakesandstays.wordpress.com
This relatively new 20 seater cafe. They do not have a physical menu as of now, hence their staff will be there to let you know what they serve verbally. 
Limited menu that\'s recited to you by the staff. Delicious food served with a moody, so-hip-that-it-hurts vibe. Laidback chillout beats. Light\'s turned low with pockets of warm lighting. Slinky club feel. But filled with delicious smells of sizzling bacon and fresh coffee. Unexpected but nice. 
I reckon this is one of the best scrambled eggs I\'ve had. It just slips down your throat - a result of quality ingredients, watchful cooking and very well-controlled heat. Added my favourite bacon and portobello mushrooms to make it my version of a happy meal.
I\'m back! Starting early for this year.. Here\'s the first stop.. Ronin cafe, located near the party central of SG, it\'s in Clarke Quay.. What\'s on the list? Never leave without trying their Brioche French Toast with Stewed Pear, Crispy Bacon and Hazelnut Butter (with just the name, and how it looks, forgive me for I have sinned, it\'s a sweet, heavenly temptation). Another one is The Skinny Flat White. We\'ll, one thing\'s for sure, it doesn\'t make you skinny, but you\'ll love it. The Roast Beef Sandwich is also a must-try. The environment? Trust me, we forgot how long we stayed. I\'ll be coming back to try the the others! This is a yummy start to complete this journey. I have nvr regretted I tried it first.
Nah i\'m kidding, i would have ate it in any case. #foodporn
It\'s no surprise Ronin serves the best coffee in town, along with sister cafes The Plain and The Bravery. Boasting an ambience of of dark mystery, this is a place for quiet time alone, or a relaxing brunch with your best friend. Go for the French toast, and if you\'re up for something new, try the Wicked - a genius concoction of mint, chocolate and coffee that comforts your insides like no other. Photo by Alain Foodology
I\'m not a fan of mint but this mint infused mocha has my thumbs up! Smooth and earthy coffee with a kick of mint. Another pls!
Flat White at it\'s best 
Brunch + dinner. Food is my comfort. Really good food good ambience and good coffee here. 只想找个地方放空..
Absolutely awesome. Everything was too damn good, even my boyf sang praises of it (not easy okay, he damn picky) ^^ not to mention that everything was so affordable too! 
Had a good dim sum lunch with family, went for vinyasa yoga class, now having my favourite soy mocha, and later claypot rice dinner at home ahhh I want to live like this everyday. #100happydays #day33 #iknowiskippedaday
Creamy scrambled eggs, grilled pork sausage, Portobello mushroom, avocado &amp; toast. #love #yummy #foodporn
Felt like a secret place that is far from the maddening crowd...
Enjoying a cuppa at what seemed like a secret location...  It was dark and all the staff were friendly and attentive... Although we were in town, it felt like we were some where much further away.
Next stop! But the lighting here is way too dim for any proper shots! 😞
$14. Pardon the blur photo my hands must be shaking from the excitement of eating this. Soft fluffy French toast with bacon, apples, maple syrup and this awesome nutty butter? Everything tasted so good. My friend and I were like all THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I\'VE EATEN (at least I haven\'t had anything better YET). &amp; we conspired to tell people that it sucked so no one will come(was pretty crowded) but it\'s against my conscience HAHA.
Liked how everything came together a good balance like nothing overpowers anything (and the cheese!! Always a sucker for cheese!) except perhaps we waited too long the bread was tough AND the French toast we had outshined it so it was just not bad. 
Wicked Sick - Mint Mocha.
Second time having this delicious French toast and #RONIN_sg never fails to deliver! \n<br />On a side note, I finally met Laura in reality, the creative space whisperer behind Ronin and The Plain. Am also glad to see my fave barista Joy, from the Plain on her off day at Ronin today. It was a great pleasure seeing you lovely folks. Thank you for the amazing works!
Luxurious coffee, lushly sweet with the milk chocolateyness and the light, fresh breath of the mint leaves relaxes into cooling shadows. 
Another unlabeled place by the people behind the plain and the bravery.
This was goooood
Decadent delight!
scrambled eggs with mushroom
a cup of flat white for an energy boost
...choose your battles babe / then you\'ll win the war.
finally gotta try this well hidden gem of a punk rock cafe which serves really good cofee and food. had dirty ronin which basially egg and spicy pork sausage and french toast. the toast was kind of awesome... not as nice as tt of little diner but theres this lingering after taste which will draw me back. overall a must try :)
What\'s truly enticing about a good French toast is a balance of salty and sweet, and the one at Ronin totally nails it with their Brioche French Toast with Stewed Pear, Crispy Bacon and Hazelnut Butter. The crispy bacon is just salty enough to offset the maple syrup, and the pear is so soft and juicy. This can be easily finished by one person, and you may not want to share anyway. As always, be sure to have a coffee here. Photo by Jayne Tan.
Not your usual French Toast, as Ronin\'s version comes with a twist. The toast was soft and fluffy, instead of crispy because it was drenched in maple syrup. Accompanied with caramelized apples and crispy bacon, this combination added a new dimension of taste.
Ronin\' French toast from a different view. The toast was soft and fluffy, instead of crispy because it was drenched in maple syrup. Accompanied with caramelized apples and crispy bacon, this combination added a new dimension of taste.
One of the perks about working in the Central Business District, is that you can often meet up with like-minded foodies for lunch.
Intense aromatic complex carries in layered richness from aroma to finish. 
Crispest bacon with sweet, stewed apples with perfectly eggy brioche. The bacon was crispier than before, the hazelnut butter more unctuous. I\'ve had this 2 Saturdays in a row, and I\'m already looking forward to next weekend.
Tasted really good 
Contains Spicy Chorizo, egg, creamy miso sauce, vegetables and Gruyere cheese which was savoury and spicy; a dish suited for the Singaporean tastebuds
Strongly recommended! Fluffy toast with huge chunks of soft, juicy and fresh caramalised apples. Caramalised bacon a daring addition but adds a savoury touch to all that sweetness
The same Genovese blend used in the coffees served at The Plain and The Bravery and tasted rather similar with the Flat Whites served there as well, which was moderate intensity
I need to try the other sandwiches too. 
Brioche French toast with house-made hazelnut butter, stewed green apples, crispy bacon. Hands down -- the BEST French toast I\'ve ever had. Eggy, fluffy brioche with not-too-sweet, perfectly stewed apples complemented by salty bacon. Each bite was balanced and satisfying, a must-try for sure.
Found another new gem in the midst of clarke quay. Really love the ambience and how the owner put in effort into decorating the whole cafe! 😁😁😁
Vintage cinema chairs in a Tokyo inspired space. Strong dark sense of industrial chic fitting of the name- Ronin.
Solid coffee, that\'s what you\'ll expect from the folks of The Plain.
One should not leave without trying their awesome sandwiches. My choice of crusty fungi rocket toast. Make room for mushrooms - a good option for vegetarians.

However, time and time again, the decision naturally falls onto this wickedly good cup of mocha mint.

Their signature minted mocha. Delish! $7.50
It was good but not amazing! Sigh, this is the true problem with the millennial generation. 😫
For the PERFECT scrambled eggs and Wicked mocha
More of Chocolaty &amp; Nutty, lighter on the Coffee making it Rich &amp; Tasty which is easy on the palate. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: Their Coffee is from Genovese Coffee Blend imported from the land down under, Australia. 🇦🇺\n<br />This might be the one of the only cafes in town that doesn\'t use local coffee roasters or from those \"Small Batches, Artisanal, Organic Coffee Farmers\" these \'words\' have certainly been overused, abused &amp; marketed.

The scrambled eggs are no doubt one of the creamiest one i have tried, but it is lacking in flavor. I have mine with toast and portobello mushrooms! Only $12.50 for this~ I also wrote about my experience here http://bit.ly/2njKsKe
Oh boy been eons since I came. The Egg on Toast ($11) is what I always order; have your eggs either Scrambled or Poached. The former is one of my top 3 Scrambled I\'ve ever had; still as good as b4. The Sourdough is slightly buttered and toasted to perfection I leave no bread untouched. Added on Bacon ($4), Portobello Mushroom, Avocado &amp; Wilted Spinach (all $3.5) because this are all my favourites. Oh dun forget to order their signature mint mocha, the Wicked ($6 Hot / $8 Cold) &amp; the Matcha-Tone ($6 Hot / $8 Cold).\n<br />~\n<br />Pic Taken @Ronin.Cafe \n<br />17 Hongkong Street\n<br />Singapore 059660\n<br />Operating Hours: 8am - 6pm Daily\n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RONIN.17HKST\n<br />Website: http://ronin.sg\n<br />~

Wicked .
One of the good ones

Today\'s Wicked lacked the flavour of espresso and was pretty much just a peppermint hot chocolate

Think just call it scrambled eggs with bacon, avocado &amp; etc. As expected from The Bravery &amp; Plain, the quality is there. Nice. \n<br />#breakfast #brunch #burpple #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife #cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeeaddict #coffeegram #coffeeholic #coffeelife #coffeelove #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #instacoffee #lunch #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #scrambledeggs #bacon #avocado #ronin

Wicked - Minty Mocha! Taste like After Eight! Yums! 
😆😎
yummy ice chocolate and french toast.. #nomnomnom #mycafediary #sgcafe #cafe #burpple #onthetable #cafehopping #filter #vscocam #YOLO #ronin
Opened by the people from The Plain, the coffee at RONIN doesn\'t disappoint. Heard rave reviews about this hideout at Hongkong Street and decided to pay a visit today. This place definitely oozes class with it\'s dark design interior and decor. Tried the WICKED coffee today (and it\'s wicked sick), which is a peppermint mocha made from genovese coffee. Will definitely return for the simple yet acclaimed scrambled eggs on toast.
Leave your cards at home they are not welcomed here 💸💸💸
Sweet, tasty and yummy ...
Carbo loading with French toast and bacon. Yums.
Done perfectly!
Peppermint-infused mocha - there\'s no way you could go wrong with this one, guys.
Really wicked cup of mocca-mint! Leaves you wanting for more... more... mocca.
Mmm..
Love it!\n<br />#Icedlatte #chocolate\n<br />#peppermint #mint #coffeebreak #ronin #coffee #drinkoftheday #picoftheday #8dayseatout #ilovepeppermint #instadrink

loving the french toast, scrambled egg and ice chocolate... everything is so perfect 
The mandatory shot everyone will take when they come to this pretty cafe
post-run; pre-church. #breakfast #onthetable #ronin_sg
The same Genovese blend that The Plain and The Bravery uses for their coffee. Sufficient chocolate sauce and milk was added, which made for its balanced flavour. Loved the way which it was presented which seemed somewhat abstract.
Coffee was good. 
Chilling in a pretty cafe with a  nice cup of coffee might be the best thing ever!
For dark conversations and darker secrets. #cafe #sg
