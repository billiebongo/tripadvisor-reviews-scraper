Vanilla Gelato, Salted Egg York Sauce, Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Love Letter ($8.50 excluding GST)
6 pieces, Salted Egg York Sauce &amp; Sour Cream Dill Sauce ($5.90) - Tender chicken n great sauce.
Spaghetti with grilled chicken and salted egg yolk sauce. Food is not bad, but need to buck up on their plating. As for the salted egg yolk taste, it isn\'t as \'gao\' as Chinese zichar, instead, it slightly tweak for a fusion mix, which I think they did it quite well.
Vanilla gelato and love letter atop crisp waffle with salted egg yolk and caramel sauce. By the way, if you love salted egg yolk anything, Griddy has a good variety here, from appetisers to mains to desserts!
Pretty enjoyable while the texture of the waffle reminds us of A&amp;W\'s. 🍴

If you haven\'t then you should because this taste really awesome. I love their laksa sauce. It\'s nothing like the normal pasta you have tried before. They are having lots of new main dishes for their new menu and all with no pork no lard. So for folks living in the west, good for you but if you are not staying nearby, it\'s located at Westgate which is just beside Jurong East MRT station. Or if you have previously tried Griddy before. Give their new mains a try too. You won\'t be disappointed.
Located at B2 of Westgate, you get to enjoy wings with the choice of 2 dips out of the following 4:\n<br />- Laksa\n<br />- Creamy Garlic\n<br />- Salted Egg Yolk\n<br />- Dill\n<br />And my favourite here is Laksa dip of cos! Never thought of it? Neither did i.\n<br />————\n<br />More known for their waffles, this place serves pasta and mains as well. Their tomyum pasta is recommended.\n<br />————\n<br />Thanks @griddysg for having us and the ever hot-babe @dianaaatan for the invite!
The Beef isn\'t too dry and hard. Topped with mushroom. I wish I could drizzle 1 of their many dipping sauce. More pictures soon!
For $7.50 ($8.10 including service charge), you get a really chewy waffle with no crunch, marshmallows and cheap chocolate ice-cream.
I ordered a Griddy Burger with waffles instead of bread, it costs $9.90. Not fantastic burger, but it\'s $9.90 so I considered it not bad. You can add $3.50 for two drumlets or waffles and an iced peach tea. Small place but baby chair available.
Portion is good for one and sharing. Waffles are crispy but the rocher ice cream is average. Smores is still passable. 
CHOCOBANANA!!!!!! waffleicecream and fries together.... this combination IS MY FAV!! The waffle is crispy and the chocolate icecream blended well with banana. Its acceptable for a notafanofchocolateicecreamlover hence I hereby conclude its affordable and nice i will definitely recommend to all 😛👍🏼
$2.90 (for takeaways only), you get better quality (not as airy, crispy edges) prima deli-like waffles!! The waffles batter was slightly tasteless hence the s\'mores toppings complimented it well! Good to go tea time snack if you are around the area and craving a sweet satisfying treat!  
Been having waffle cravings for the longest time; this was the nearest fix I could get. Didn\'t find any great reviews nor poor reviews to help me decide if I wanted to eat here. It wasn\'t terrible but it wasn\'t good. The waffle was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside - undercooked? Tallies with a review I read, but she too wasn\'t sure. Portion was small - similar to an Eggo waffle. This cost $7.45. It was listed as $6-ish on their menu. What am I paying service change for? I have to walk to the counter to order. The waffle is served to me, &amp; cutlery given to me as well - maybe that\'s what I\'m paying for. I wasn\'t exceedingly unhappy here but I wouldn\'t return again. Let\'s just say I am looking forward to my waffle maker arriving in the mail.....
Served as a burger but it is made up from Soft Waffle instead of bread. Sandwhich is topped with tender beef, sunny egg and salty bacon. Garden salad was nice with the savor salad dressing and crispy fries
$8.90, served with #waffle# fries that are really crispy and potatoey. Topped with turkey bacon, the chicken was tender, but where was the BBQ? The waffles was stuffed with lettuce and tomato, and there, the BBQ sauce buried beneath the chicken on the waffle itself, so it became a bit soggy with the veg. Nothing special about the waffles and ok might be slightly undercooked. But overall it was quite enjoyable. Or maybe I was really hungry.
Have you ever tried having waffle with a meat/fish?? Griddy Gourmet Waffles will give you this chance to try it out! The prices are really cheap so it\'s worth the try! ;)
Finally came to #griddy to try their #wafflewich and it\'s pretty good! Chicken and turkey ham wafflewich ($9.60).
Hazelnut waffles seriously never fails! This tasted better than the Smores though the waffle portion was quite small. 
Happy midweek guys! 😋 We are having eggsploive lunch deal at Griddy gourmet waffles. It\'s available from Mon - Fri from 11am - 3pm and only $5.90++
It looks good doesn\'t it? Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
A burger made with waffles? That\'s right! This is one of their signatures. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
Ming was intrigued by the concept of savory and dessert style of waffles but was met with a disappointment. The utensils provided were stained and Ming &amp; friends had to wiped it to feel better. Waffles tasted quite alright but it was too small and not worth the price. 
Sick of the same plain waffles or waffles with ice cream? Try this awesome and delicious waffles at Westgate! It\'s something unusual and interesting, and it\'s cheap! Less than $10! :D One bad thing about this place is the small environment. . But nonetheless, give it a try. :D
I must admit, when it comes to waffles, I am very fussy and have super high expectations. I was looking forward to fluffy waffles but what I got was flat, undercooked waffles. The oil from the chicken was not drained well and made the waffles even soggier than it already is. And I felt like it was a mess for me to eat. There was nothing eggy about this dish and the hard boiled egg was overcooked with a huge grey ring around the yolk. But at $6.90 with a drink, I guess it\'s not too bad. 
Always loved waffles and ice cream combination. In this case, i\'m particularly in favour of the hazelnut ice cream. It tasted so goood.
The waffles are such a must try - fluffy and tastes pretty good with the vanilla taste! The banana together with rocher chocolate complements the waffles so so well. A must visit in the west!
The waffles had a hint of vanilla in it, and it was truly one to try! :) the burgers were good as well, the patty portions were pretty big for the waffles. Certainly a hidden gem!
Really nice! Eat it once and I am addicted to it. 💝
finally this is checked in my bucketlist! overall was quite nich and nice, i think i took tad long time to take the best shot so it turned out a lil cold :/ fries are good, chicken was okay and i think it\'s quite unique to eat this with a waffle! gonna try their other menu on next visit! btw there are daily lunch promos at 50% off! i got this for $3.95! you do the math lah hor! 😝 #lunch #gotgriddy #waffles #waffleburger #hawaiian #chicken #fries
Aloha Hawaiian at only $4.25 after 50% off.
As sweet as it look but the waffle below doesnt soften even with the ice cream placed on top. :D
6 straight days on a waffle diet! I need to go for a brief hiatus!
Need to spam more more maple syrup!
Catching the ocean with my Griddy waffles for dinner! Ocean Catch ($7.90) Fish cutlet, lettuce, tomato, tartar sauce, japanese mayonnaise, bonito flakes with classic waffle. 
Interesting mix of waffle and beef. Generous portion of beef patty, delicious and relatively cheap.

The waffle criss cut fries here are thick with substantial fillings of potato, an ideal filling:batter ratio unlike the usual fries out there that bears a higher proportion of batter:fillings. Exterior was deep fried to a crisp perfection as well! In order to prevent sogginess, I opted for the sauce to be served separately which also comes with shredded nori as a side too! I was glad I did as the fries did indeed became soggy after contact with the Mentaiko sauce after some time. Nevertheless, it was still an enjoyable, additive sidekick that I couldn’t stop laying my hands on, especially with the creamy Mentaiko sauce that bears a pleasant savoury umami flavour.  What’s more, one of the staff witnessed me taking photos and even offered me a side of ebiko roe as well for a more “photogenic” effect 🙈. (PS: The Mentaiko fries would only be available till end of the month, as part of the seasonal special menu) . .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice #gotgriddy
✨ Along with baby scallops, sliced mushrooms, the spaghetti is tossed in creamy and thick Mentaiko sauce and topped with a copious amount of seaweed and ebiko roe. Given the pocket-friendly pricing and the conventional setting of this place, I didn’t harbor much hope on this dish, just giving it a shot as a fan of Mentaiko. However, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as Mentaiko flavour in the slightly al dente spaghetti was one that’s distinctive, creamy with a pleasant umami savoury note. What’s more, there’s also a substantial amount of ingredients provided! The baby  scallops had a pleasant firmness to the bite, with a slight chewiness whereas the mushrooms were chewy, lending a subtle earthy note (though overwhelmed by the Mentaiko sauce). Along with shredded nori and a heap of ebiko roe, this pasta exceeded my expectations and is indeed worth the bill (and indulgence) if you are a fan of Mentaiko! PS: I got greedy and decided to order a bucket of mentaiko fries all for myself as well, with no eventual regrets! 💖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice #gotgriddy

Quite a good balance between the sweet and savoury!👌🏻 .\n<br />On a side note, I wonder how long this salted egg yolk hype will last?😅

This a real surprise. Salted egg yolk sauce actually goes well with ice cream and waffles! You gonna try it to believe it!
The chicken goes with both dips. Recommended to try!
Yums! #burpple #tingzieeats
Can\'t resist a combination like this.😌 The vanilla ice cream came up to be pretty good too! 👌🏻
If you are not up for the adventure, go for Tom Yum with Pan-seared Salmon [$10.90]. // Thank you @griddysg for hosting!
[Over The Rainbow S$11.90] - we all need our fair share of rainbows in our lives right? 🌈🌈 A sweet treat of vanilla and strawberry cheesecake gelato topped over crispy-outside-fluffy-inside waffles, drizzled with strawberry syrup. Sissy says it reminded her of A&amp;W waffles which I had cleanly forgot how it taste like. 😝
They could have toned down the chilli quotient though as it was just too overpowering spicy :)\n<br />#tomyampasta #tomyamspaghetti #salmon #gotgriddy #griddysg #sgcafe #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Works best with Laksa dip :)\n<br />#chickenwings #dips #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #griddysg
Had our dessert @ Griddy! Delicious! 
Mmmmm
Unique setting, crispy fried fries with lotsa cheese and mayo! 
A pretty small portion, so it\'s kinda depressing, but the combination of ice cream &amp; waffles are really good! Could be a tad bit crispy tho!
