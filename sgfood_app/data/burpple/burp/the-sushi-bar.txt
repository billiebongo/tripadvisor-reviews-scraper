The salmon/tuna/other Japanese meats I cannot remember were fresh as heck but all this time I was mad scared of a GB5 infection post meal lol I see the hype in the chirashi fandom but ok sashimi is really not ma thing #marshmunch #burpple
It is written on the menu as \"otoro tataki\" which loosely translate as slightly grilled medium fat sliced pork belly.\n<br />One of the must order item when you step into the sushi bar. Instantaneous melt in your mouth with abundance oil and BBQ pork smell penetrating into your nose and head. The after-taste of the slightly grilled pork will make you craving for the next slice. Beware the price, but the taste will justify it. #thesushibar #thesushibar_sg
Scallop Mentaiyaki Carpaccio is a must order whenever I come to Sushi Bar (besides the sushi rolls of course). Thinly sliced fresh scallop done carpaccio style goes wonderfully with the salty creaminess of the mentaiko sauce. More please! 
Chunky pieces of fish. Every mouth tastes so full and delicious! I go back to them quite often to get the Chirashi don craving fixed. üëçüèº
The chirashi don that needs no introduction.
If you love aburi and chirashi don, you\'ll love the Aburi Chirashi Don (S$30.95) at The Sushi Bar. The aburi sashimi is really fresh and melts in your mouth, and there\'s more fish than rice in my aburi chirashi don! üòò
Always love the fresh, thick cuts of sashimi here. The chirashi serving is also great and it\'s so value for money!
Tucked within the depths of Far East Plaza, but still able to maintain a fully packed restaurant, owed largely (I believe) to their reasonable pricing and to their Aburi Rolls. This one\'s stuffed with fried Ebi tempura, rolled with cured salmon, finished with a large dollop of torched mentaiko. Say ahhhh..
Torched raw scallops and mentaiko mayonnaise, served along side chopped scallions and additional ebiko for extra pop! We wiped the plate sparkly. 
Finally trying this famous sushi place with my sashimi-sushi-Japanese food loving family! We are very satisfied with the sushi rolls and sashimi here!! One of the better Japanese places with mentaiko dishes (even though mum still prefers ippoudo mentaiko that I have nvr tried before?). We found the tamago sushi slightly too sweet but decent! 
This don is filled with all the goodness you can get! The seafood tastes amazing, esp the swordfish and scallop. üëçüèº you get two of each kinds of seafood and it\'ll definitely fill you up even though the portion doesn\'t look that big! Do give their aburi salmon roll and dragon roll a a try too! Fresh and tasty. They\'re worth it! The Don costs $26.90 while the rolls are about $15.90. Do note that everyone needs to be present before you can get a table. A generally bustling atmosphere good for smaller groups (4-6pple)
Apart from the popular chirashi bowls, the unagi fried rice was surprisingly good too! 
Finally made my first visit to The Sushi Bar. Spoilt by the many choices of Sushi Rolls and Donburi there but eventually settled for the Salmon &amp; Ikura Don which is the most similar to the other Donburis I have had at other places so far. Indeed, they were not stingy with Ikura that bursts of umami flavour and fresh salmon sashimi slices which were smooth, with rice that is slightly sweet from the vinegar. All in all it starts off pretty delectable, but gets a bit flat and boring halfway for it becomes a tad repetitive. Perhaps ordering their Chirashi could have been a better option for the variety of ingredients that would have made this more interesting throughout.
Thicker-than-thick slabs of assorted aburi fish for less than $35? #shutupandtakemymoney I absolutely loved how the smokiness didn\'t mask the freshness of the fish, but accentuated their natural sweetness even more. Beyond being a stomach filler, the tasty rice grains were very well seasoned and perfectly al dente, upping the pleasure with bursts of ikura. You can\'t put a price on such satisfaction.  
Similar to their Salmon Aburi Roll but we ended up choosing this one for it has the whole package plus the crispy fried Tempura Prawn rolled within so you get a crunch. The dollop of Mentaiko over the Salmon Aburi definitely helped by adding a umami flavour to the rolls!
Basic Chirashi Don at The Sushi Bar. Might look good but the cut of the fish is quite bad. Was expecting like a Bara Chirashi kinda thing but nah. Quite disappointing for $19.90++. Probably worth it to top up $5 more for their Normal Chirashi Don w better cut. üëéüèª #thesushibar
Perfectly grilled and very tender, flavor or the meat itself was so good no need for dipping sauce for me üòÑ
Thick slices of fresh melt-in-your-mouth sashimi. The must-have of every chirashi don. My personal favourites was the refreshingly sweet tamago, made tastier by the fact that it is slightly chilled. And of course, the swordfish and salmon. 
When one goes to the sushi bar, one MUST try the salmon aburi roll. 
The beef was so good that I enjoyed it with and without dipping the sauce. I like the presentation of the dish. Generous amount of sauce set aside in a sauce dish. Fish roes, scallions and fried onions placed in a corner so I could put as much/little of what I want. Love! üòç
\"Small or regular bowl?\" You might be stuck in this dilemma because you want to stuff yourself with lotsa sashimi but you also wanna leave some tummy space for other good stuff. My solution: go for Regular bowl (3 slices of each sashimi) and share with a friend. 
Maybe I was there at the wrong day. The scallops were not very fresh. Disappointed üò≠
What siok of Salmon Aburi ! Juicy &amp; fresh Salmon is scrumptious to bite and sushi rice is wrapped well to its level of excellent tasty. More shiok to the grill sprayed salmon at the top !
Go for 3 Kind of Sashimi instead of 6 type sashimi. Too much if go for 6 kinds because it is only 10 fingers having a sushi dinner and its a raw food ! Fresh Sashimi and can be as a warm up starter. Nonetheless Salmon will be always the most loved.
Right here at The Sushi Bar, they serve only the freshest sashimi with decent thickness giving you the shiokness mouthfeel! And they are really generous with their servings and variety of sashimi considering the price I\'ve paid for! Totally love the place minus the long queue though! 
torched sashimi, including salmon, tuna, yellowfish, swordfish, scallop and salmon roe. they even served torched tamago together with the rice. \n<br />look at the amount of relatively thick slices of torched sashimi, I cannot even see my rice anymore! for the price, it is pretty worth it for the quality and amount of sashimi. \n<br />but some sashimi are not meant to be torched - like swordfish and scallop. great attempt for aburi lovers, but I\'d still choose their normal chirashi don anytime! \n<br />one thing to note, the new place at ngee ann is simply so much more spacious than the one at far east! currently still at soft launch, their grilled items are not available.
The Chirashi dons are always delish at the Sushi Bar. However, not sure if it\'s just me, but the portion at the Far East branch seems to be more generous as compared to this newly opened branch at Ngee Ann City. Regardless, I decided to try their Aburi version, but was slightly disappointed. You pay a $4 premium for the Aburi version, but it more or less tastes the same, maybe at most a slight charred taste. The sashimi doesn\'t melt in your mouth unlike what you would expect from aburi stuff, and I don\'t think it\'s worth the additional charge. Having said that, the sushi was still fresh, and thick slices were given which is always a plus. No queue here at the Ngee Ann City branch! 
Large chunky pieces of sushi sitting there on a plate waiting to be gobbled up. Another one of their signatures, this certainly did not disappoint. The salmon really melts in your mouth, and the glob of mentaiko sauce at the top is always welcome. Really one of their must-haves at this place!
Thinly sliced scallops with mentaiko sauce torched to perfection. This is so good that I could just finish an entire plate by myself. The scallops were sweet, and the slightly tart sauce complimented it really well. The roe and spring onion added a nice crunchy texture to the dish. Mad love for this dish; awesome way to start a meal at Sushi Bar!
I love the chirashi Don in The Sushi Bar, their sashimi are the freshest I have ever tasted! It cost almost 30$ after gst and service charge but it was so worth it. There was so much sashimi that I got so sick of eating them after some time.. Which technically wasn\'t a good thing üòÖ. I would advise people to go on a very, very empty stomach because I had to really force the last three slices down. That was really the first time I had difficulties finishing up sashimi because I am a huge lover who\'s always wanting more sashimi! By the way, we also ordered an aburi roll which wasn\'t very nice so you can give that a miss (save stomach space!) and just go for their chirashi Don. 
Sweet, sticky Japanese pearl rice buried under chunks of #rawfish (salmon, tuna, yellowtail), tamago &amp; ikura.
Thinly sliced and goes really well with the sauce. Order the 200g option for 4 persons and above. Complements your normal chirashi don perfectly. Stop reading and order lah! 
Especially those with charred salmon, ebi and mentaiko, it always tempts me successfully.
Would be tastier if the pitan taste was stronger! 
Had this a few times in the past. The cuts became thicker and one of them was so tough we had a difficult time chewing. I\'m not sure if I still like it anymore! 
Raw salmon &amp; avocado #sushi topped with torched salmon &amp; a dollop of mayonnaise.
This is a winner. The tofu has that tofu like texture, and the century egg sauce is so light and not overwhelming. This black and white combo goes well hand in hand, that\'s it\'s a two thumbs up for me. And those tobiko adds another dimension of crunch. üëç Yumz 
Luckily, the queue on that weekday evening was not too bad, and I managed to get a table in 15 minutes. I would actually come back for the spaghetti, as it was fish roe overdose! My fav!
Super duper slurpslurps! Took a trip down during lunch to celebrate my colleague\'s bday! 
Super duper worth the $14.90++ for this! Best to go in a group to have this as a shared dish. 
Affordable ($18.90) chirashi don with cuts (instead of slices) of sashimi. I found it fresh and delish, with the portion being just right. It\'s a good first chirashi experience for me.
Picked the bara chirashi because it was easy to eat and, yes it\'s easily one of those comforting food (sashimi fresh, uni was creamy) after a long day at work. That\'s if you like your fish raw, of course. Well the food is good, but the service crew made me feel uncomfy like I overstayed my visit after I had finished with my don üòî
Love the thick cuts of Salmon and Yellow Tail from The Sushi Bar! Feel the fresh sweetness of the fish explode in your mouth in perfect symphony with the Wasabi and Soy sauce! #burpple
The place is noisy as always, but serves very good food and great for chats over dinner. We love Wagyu beef and thought the occasion called for it - an opportunity came up that led us to happily discussing options. Thus we gave it a shot and it sure didn\'t disappoint us! I\'m glad we found this new place on our dare night!
Love everything here except for the policy that all parties must arrive before a table can be allocated to you.
The Sushi Bar offers this mountain of fresh fish cubes (salmon, tuna, yellowtail), salmon roe, tamago and dollop of uni over a bed of rice for a very affordable price. Spare your wallet, spoil yourself. Photo by Burppler Michelle Kayla Tay #Burpple
which\'s your favorite \n<br />really love how thick their slices here are.
Have not been posting for a long time. Anyway, recently I had my chirashi fix at the sushi bar. Loved the generous amount of thick cuts of sashimi. However, would prefer the rice to be warmer. For ($24.90) for the normal chirashi, it is pretty affordable considering the portion of this chirashi don. nice nice nice!
finally satisfying my craving here at @thesushibar_sg w @chunboonboon. the soft shell crab salmon aburi roll. you get that crunch, the salmon and a whole lot of the mentaiko.that  sensual seduction \n<br />I can safely fly off now.
This is surely a crowd-pleaser with its winning flavours - you can\'t go wrong with anything aburi &amp; mentaiko. With that said, this was well-executed and definitely worth every cent. Apart from soft shell crab, there are other variants such as breaded prawns and more salmon.
Chirashi lovers get bang for their buck with TSB\'s rendition. Here you get a mountain of fresh fish cubes (salmon, tuna, yellowtail), salmon roe, tamago and dollop of uni over a bed of well-seasoned short-grained rice. All for less than $20. Say wut?!
This is one of the place I had for the sweet salmon sashimi! It was really so good, but kind of ex $9 per plate of salmon sashimi.
The Sushi Bar serves up a basic chirashi that comes with a very generous helping of fresh sashimi. We had a platter of sashimi in addition to our 2 chirashis, which made for a very happy yet overwhelming meal. Turns out there IS a limit to how much sashimi one can consume in a single sitting. Nevertheless, food is fantastic. Go early to avoid the queue.
The bara here features triangular cuts of sashimi that are thicker, chunkier and slightly more raggedy around the edges than the usual neat cubes of fish at other Japanese joints. I prefer this to the normal chirashi, which can get too jelat.
Apart from the limited choices, the food here is not bad. Decently priced. Recommending the salmon aburi, anything with mentaiko is love! Lol! 
Definitely worth the wait! Super thick and succulent sashimi slices bedded above Japanese pearl rice:)
We talked and talked until we didn\'t finish our food üôä
I love these fusion rolls, because how else can you get your favorite toppings all in one mouthful? This one comes with tempura prawn roll with aburi salmon topped with a dollop of Mentaiyaki. Maybe I\'m biased, but anything with mentaiko instantly tastes way way better!
Having heard a lot about The Sushi Bar and the long queues, we decided to give it a try on a weeknight. Surprise surprise, there was no queue and we were quick to get a table. I love sashimi and boy, was the sashimi a steal? With 3 slices of thickly (and I mean Thick!) cut sashimi of salmon, tuna and yellowtail each for $16.90, I\'d go for second helpings! 
One of the recommended dishes at the sushi bar with thin slices of scallop and seared mentaiko sauce and a dollop of cod roe. Who knew something so simple could taste this good? üòä
The contrast between the crispy Ebi, soft &amp; smooth salmon and mentaiko makes it so delicious „Äã$14.50
This is what we ordered! Their aburi sushi is a must-order! We arrived, thinking there would be a queue. 30mins later, the crowds started pouring in. Total damage: $99.50
Roasted salmon wrapped around the sushi and the combination of avocado and crab stick. No wonder this is easily one of the signature dish! Fall in love almost after the first bite üòç
We waited 20mins for this to be served! At $24.90, you probably will give it a miss if you don\'t like grilled fish head! üòÇ
Who does not love a good, hearty bowl of sashimi and rice? Chock full of fresh seafood goodness on top of fragrant sushi rice, the Chirashi Don ($24.90) at The Sushi Bar at Far East Plaza will leave you wanting more. A wide variety of thickly-sliced, fresh sashimi is given that will certainly satisfy your palette, if not your stomach. Their other dishes, which includes their much-lauded Salmon Aburi Roll ($14.90), are top-notch as well. However, be sure to make a reservation or be prepared to queue for at least 30 minutes. The prices are a little on the steep side as well; between the two of us, the bill came up to $40 each. However, the quality of the food certainly makes it a bang for the buck. 
$10.90++ a serving. Angel hair pasta in creamy sauce. Simple dish.
$13.90++ a serving. Thinly sliced scallops, topped with fish sauce and touched.
$17.90++, one of the most ordered dish in the restaurant. Easily found in almost all the table.
$5.50++ for a piece of grilled oyster with fish roe sauce.
$12.90++ for salmon head miso soup, with lots of mushrooms, tofu, radish and spring onions in it.
Crabstick, raw salmon, cucumber and avocado tucked in a roll of rice and seaweed, with half-grilled salmon and mentaiko on top. This is nice, but I definitely prefer Koh Grill\'s Shiok Maki, because the excessive torched mentaiko sauce on that one is so much more, well, shiok. 
Pretty good value for money, with salmon, tuna, scallop, swordfish, yellowtail, salmon aburi, egg, and ikura. But I found the slices too thick for my liking, the sashimi had raggedy edges, the scallops had a rubbery membrane and the tuna was terribly fishy. Not impressed. 
Carpaccio of scallop with a smattering of mentaiko, blowtorched. Nom nom. 
Chunky pieces of Sashimi. At that price, its quite worth it. But I wouldn\'t queue for more than half an hour for this. But that is also because I don\'t like having to queue too long for food. :p
Taste of the sea burst in my mouth. :) #thesushibar #pasta #throwback
And we found out the answer to why it was so!
too hungry and we took away a roll of aburi. what\'s next üòÖüòÖ
again üòè #sorrynopenotsorry üôä Anyway! Public Announcement Service: those of you who saw my list of 25 Places To Eat in Sg with Nett Prices would know that I had listed #TheSushiBar as one of the places. Unfortunately with effect from 1 Jul 14, they have since started charging GST and service charge üòê so just a heads up! Happy Monday üéâüéâ
The sushi here is delicious! Definitely try their Salmon Aburi Roll w generous portions of salmon scorched to perfection. Unagi sushi and Chirashi dons are good too
The salmon aburi here certainly beats the aburi at Wisma Atria. For one, this roll\'s more affordable. For two, you taste more of the salmon and its chargrilled fragrance compared to WA\'s cream/cheese-ness. 
although de standard has dropped alittle, still very  yummlicious.  cravings satisfied.
Feels great to have such good,fresh and not so expensive jap food  without q-ing for once!
me just heart this ebi fry aburi. good morning thinking of what to eat tonight? this could be the place .
This hole-in-the-wall jap eatery has gained much popularity that they have opened another branch in the same building. I like how generous they served their premium chirashi-don with fresh sashimi and thickly sliced.
my utmost favourite dish here and nowhere else is comparable.  it\'s just tt slightly delicate burnt jap mayo taste complimenting with the fresh sashimi.
The all-time favorite sushi place for youngsters.. Now at a new location, bigger and spacious! Ordered the usual chirashi don and it was awesome!! Must try for all chirashi don lovers! 
I still vividly remember my first visit to sushibar years back when it first lifted it\'s shutters, located at the 3rd floor. falling in love with this simple yet unassuming dish. \'it is just raw fishes cut up and assembled\' I said. when we finished that dinner, I was full of praise and have been a regular since, recommending it to so many ppl, and even tourist abroad. fast forward to 2014, I\'m still excited to say that it\'s standards have relatively maintained. always looking forward to my next visit.
Super shiok! Thick and fresh cut of sashimi over a thin layer of sushi rice! 
First time after they moved. Larger space but the queue was longer than ever. This chirashi is still the best value for money of all the restaurants I\'ve been to so far! (The portion was really big todayüòÇ)
Opens at 1230 but queue starts much, much earlier. Closed on Sundays, the sushi rolls and chirashi don are amazing and amazingly well priced
understated, tucked away but one of the best sushi joint revelations yet üç£
The crazy queues made up of mainly 18-25s is a good indication of the value The Sushi Bar delivers. The Normal Chirashi Don is unbelievably satisfying at $24, with decadent cuts of fresh sashimi. The Salmon Aburi rolls appear on every table, topped with lightly-seared salmon and mentaiko mayo, to-die-for! Make reservations early, or simply join the hungry queue.
Whenever I visit The Sushi Bar, the sirloin steak is one of the items that I\'ll order. Priced at almost $30 for 200g, it\'s probably one of the most expensive items on their menu but trust me, it\'s worth every single cent. Thin slices of wagyu sirloin blowtorched to perfection, every bite is bliss. I would probably go on eating it forever if I could. Let\'s just say that I\'m already planning my next visit back to The Sushi Bar.
Have been eyeing this place ever since it opened more than a year ago and today, I finally embarked on a 40mins queue to find out what the hype is all about. Tucked away in a little corner of Far East Plaza, all I can say this is definitely one of S\'pore\'s best kept secrets for good, yet affordable Sushi. The rest is for you to find out...
LOVE THIS. Rather affordable compared to shiok maki. Roughly about 2$ cheaper , but taste wise shiok maki wins in my opinion lol
The Sushi Bar is known for two things: long queues and salmon aburi rolls. Their aburi rolls are topped with salmon and mentaiko mayo, and lightly seared with a blowtorch. To-die-for! Be sure to order the Chirashi Don, it doesn\'t get more value-for-money at $24, with such decadently thick cuts of sashimi! Be sure to make reservations.
My fave Chirashi second to AOKI. I love the generous portion of the seafood at The Sushi Bar. The aburi salmon was the main highlight, you can actually order ala carte for the aburi salmon. The only upset here is the long waiting queue, as they do not accept reservations. 
Finally got to try what all sushi lovers are raving about. Freshness is assured considering the long queues. And the portions very generous considering the thick slices of fishes.
Rite!  Finally made our way to far east plaza sushi bar. It is our first time.. me and hubs. They have moved into a bigger space. Got there at 6pm n shown to a table near the kitchen ( inside ) there were empty tables nearer to the entrance.. but I guess they wanna fill up the space inside..seating arrangement was just too close for comfort. We felt as if we were sardines squeezed in a small tin can .. anyway this sushi roll did hit the spot or perhaps we were hungry üòú
Awesome spread; freshness and sweetness with almost every bite (the salmon was slightly disappointing in comparison tho). Also, their salmon aburi sushi and scallop mentaiyaki were yumsss!
Small and cosy outlet, the ingredients are displayed and chilled in a small see through fridge at the counter. Topped w salmon and mentaiko mayo and lightly seared w blowtorch, it\'s just so addictive. You\'ll be surprised to see this cost only $16.90 for 8 pieces of quality sushi. Freshness guaranteed and it is done so well you will be taken aback. 
still remembered being there when dey first opened and I was exposed to this dish.. since den it became one of my favs
My favorite sushi order here. Delicious!
Monthly delight. The sushi bar has moved to a bigger premise in the 4th floor of Far East Plaza. More seats = shorter queues! I hope.
The scallop is \"to-kill-for\", and bentos comes at affordable prices. Have a get-together with 3 other friends and eat to your fill with less than $30 per person. 
Similar to the Shiok Maki from Koh Grill &amp; Sushi Bar, but I personally prefer this to that!! It isn\'t as heavy laden with mayo so it isn\'t \'jelat\' (too rich). Most are able to savor every bite
$24.90. Seared salmon, tuna, salmon roe, salmon belly, yellow tail, hamachi, scallop, tamago. Brought two friends there who were so pleased with this üòÇ
Thinly sliced scallop, so fresh and tasty!!
First book out after multiple weekend duties deserves good food. ---\n<br />Had the hotate salmon aburi, salmon aburi, soft shell crab salmon aburi, and scallop mentaiyaki.\n<br /> #noregrets #foodgasm #foodporn
Fresh pieces of fish on delectable rice. $24.90 for this awesome meal!
Back again at 4:30 in the afternoon. No queue. This was delightful especially with the crunchiness of the soft shell crab inside! Will order this again.
Weekly affair. Love you.
$19.90. Hamachi, tuna, ikura, salmon! &amp; tamago. So much fresh, goodness in a bite! was too full to finish it. But I did.) #burpple
$19.90, tuna, hamachi, ikura, salmon, tamago. So much goodness in a bowl, any fresher you\'d have to.. catch it yourself? Quite value for money imo. I shall try the normal chirashi next yay!
Every bit as heavenly. This was easily the best dish of the evening. Temperature of the sashimi was perfect, the seared salmon, especially, was blew my mind. 
Super yummy because everything just sorta melts in your mouth, $13.90 for 8 rolls! 
Delicious! A no brainer here.
It might look very ge-lard but it wasn\'t at all! Although I\'m not a roe kind of person but it was tasty enough for me to slurp slurp away.
Thought it would be similar to koh\'s grill &amp; sushi bar, but I was wrong. It tasted less sinful and was tasty in a different way!
Done perfectly at medium rare. A dollar more for the special sauce and salad. All for $15.90. 
Gosh. Incredible value. Worth the 50 min wait. Will definitely come back again!
Inside this salmon aburi roll lay perfectly crispy fried prawn that just blew my mind. The contrast in texture was heavenly!
$14.90 for 100grams, this steak was perfectly done! You only need a few bites to truly savor this, what great flavor. 
Lightly seared on the outside and raw on the inside, the salmon was fresh and simply lovely. Their famous dish lived up to it\'s reputation.
At $24.90, this is amazing value! Thick slices of fresh hamachi, salmon, hotate, tuna, tamago, meikajiki and ikura. This is a must-order dish, you will be so satisfied with the quality and quantity of beautiful fish. Tip: order their freshly grated wasabi to truly enjoy your chirashi.
Thick slices of meikajiki, salmon and hamachi. Such fantastic value, we ordered this twice cos it was just too good! Be sure to order the freshly grated wasabi.
Craving for meat......... üçñüçñüçñ this is freaking nice although a little oily.. ËÇâËÇâËÇâ...
Addicted to the fresh and affordable chirashi don at The Sushi Bar! I can\'t waiting in line but I did for this- prob waited around 15 mins. So satisfied. Best to go in a small group as the other items are raved about too. 
It costs $3 a piece, a little pricey in my opinion.
This is not too bad either, although I prefer the texture of the salmon aburi roll.
The most raved about item for the sushi bar, indeed it is something to be raved about, a must try!
I had the salmon/tuna/swordfish, slices were thick and fulfilling!
One of the best dishes at the sushi bar! Salmon sushi with this yummy charred mayo sauce. Nom nom to the max. 
Sirloin that\'s perfectly cooked, retained the tenderness and juiciness. Mmmmm.. üòã
Love popping these torched goodness into my mouth! The aroma of the smokiness, silky and creamy texture, paired with the freshly grated wasabi, is so addictive!
Really thin slices, felt like I was eating the rich torched mentaiko mayonnaise sauce instead. I would give this a miss. 
Around $15 for 8 pieces of sushi. A tat expensive but extremely worth it.
So good I can\'t get enough of it!!! Had this twice in 3 days!!! üëÖüí¶
Round 2
Medium rare, 250g. Really cooked to perfection. All sauces on the plate could go perfectly well with the steak. 
One of the best aburi sushi I have ever tried. The hotate was so fresh that you could literally describe it as being sweet! Finally can understand why my ah ma always says that fresh seafood is sweet:\') 
Another seasonal special. Below the pitan, it\'s the typical Japanese tofu which many craze over. On top of the pitan there are crabmeat and roe. When i first looked at it, it\'s really hard to imagine the taste because of the combination but it\'s an ingenious creation:\') was so heavenly that we got the only two servings that were made that day hahah:)
A seasonal special where the shop only had two of it made for the day. Lucky to have gotten it because it\'s the best roe I have ever eaten. Very rich and creamy (texture similar to cream cheese)
Super fresh and thick a slice. Can totally melt once you eat it into your mouth yum
10/12/2013, Salmon Aburi. Juicy salmon and I can\'t get enough of the seared mayonnaise üòç
soft shell crab salmon aburi üç£
salmon aburi üç£ excellent value for money! 
Thick fat juicy sashimi for less than $30! The sushi bar is the go to place if you have chirashi don craving!
Salmon aburi roll and chirashi don with the most amazing (super fresh and thickly sliced) sashimi 
The thickest slab of sashimi I have ever eaten!!!! Totally worth it! 
Was pleasantly surprised by quality and quantity at this unassuming sushi place...
Was pleasantly surprised by quality and quantity at this unassuming sushi place...
$14.90 (100g) - loved this. Seared on the outside, super tender meat. Juicy. And the dips were good!! 
$16.90, quite good! Right balance of everything and the prawn was so crispy I could actually eat the tail even after leaving it aside for quite awhile HAHA
$1.80/piece. It was so good, so fresh! I\'d order chirashi the next time I go without the bf who doesn\'t eat sashimi. Their chirashi seems quite affordable too! (Oh and no svc charge!)
$5.90, was okay, fresh and yummy unagi.
At pocket friendly prices too
It\'s so hole in the wall it\'s indie. Awesome #chirashi and cheaper than Aoki and super love the soft shell crab salmon aburi roll.
Super fresh sashimi for the chirashi don. Highly raved for its salmon aburi sushi (soft shell crab) but I finds it a little too salty n would be good if they drizzle more mentayaki sauce! Downside: service need major improvement. called twice to reserve n yet they still can forgot about my reservation. 
the salmon practically melts in ur mouth with this milky after taste. totally worth it for it\'s price.
slightly charred and could do better with a creamier sauce. anyway it rocked.
Pan Fried salmon (medium cooked) served with my favourite mayo sauce! The best part? The crispy skin.
tender &amp; fatty w the right doneness. Arrived lukewarm as it was not served immediately. 
the talk of the town. aburi is way too common these days, but if you have a hankering, this is cheaper than sushi tei\'s version !
fish should b chilled... and hmmm why does it look like yusheng?
paper thin slices of scallop sashimi , lightly flamb√©-d. perhaps thicker and less slices would be better. found this tasty but a little unfulfilling. 
$36.90?! It\'s really good and they\'re very generous with the sashimi! Do remember to make a reservation!

Each bowl is topped with heaping cubes of fresh sashimi üòã Salmon, salmon belly, tuna, tako, ikura, cucumber and the tamago work harmoniously to make this a memorable dish.

soo good!!
Have you ever tried anago which is the less illustrious saltwater sibling of unagi?The anago at the Sushi Bar is grilled to such gorgeous perfection that its texture is delicately soft with an unforgettable melt in your mouth goodness.\n<br />It is incredible creamy and its natural sweetness will arouse your palate and tickle your tastebuds, leaving you in awe with every bite.\n<br />.\n<br />üè¢14 Scotts Road, Far East Square 04-28\n<br />.\n<br />üïöOpening hours:\n<br />Mon to Thurs: 11.30am to 3.30pm, 5.00pm to 9.45pm\n<br />Fri, Sat: 11.30am to 9.45pm\n<br />Sun: Closed\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤Damage: $8.00\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #igfoodies #huffposttaste #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #yummy #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #whati8today #openrice #openricesg\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg
The lightly torched mentaiko sauce on top of the salmon aburi is sublime with its tangy flavour and immaculate creaminess. Encompassing the warm, fluffy rice and crispy soft shell crab, pop the entire piece into your mouth to savour its full glory.

\"is it worth the queues?\" - sure you get bang for your buck in the Chirashi Don but with such slip shod efforts of slicing the fish and mediocre quality; you\'re better off just getting a pricier bowl with less fish and more finesse.

Difference between the normal wasabi (left) and the grated wasabi (right) obviously the right side has more kick!!

working on a weekend certainly kills more brain cells.
Simple and delicious.
With both crispy soft shell crab and juicy ebi prawn versions being affordable and appetizing, it is no surprise that they remain the more popular dishes in the outlet.
The place serves fresh seafood, are generous with their ingredients and most importantly affordable! üç±üç£ Full review with pictures and prices on the link below!

The scallop is grilled till it becomes really soft and chewy and literally glides down your throat as you indulge in it. \n<br />#SnapAndEat #sgfood #sgfoodies #openricesg #burpple #ketohloh #cafehopping #8DAYSEat

You can have a choice of Basic, Normal, Premium or Seasonal for the Chirashi Don in this hugely popular joint. \n<br />#burpple #8DAYSEat #ketohloh #cafehopping
yumm
I\'d pick this over the Bara Chirashi/ Kaisen Don from Teppei, any day. The quality of the fish here is excellent. 
Had an amazing roll and chirashi from sushi bar!
‚ù§Ô∏è
I\'m a big fan of sashimi, especially salmon sashimi. I think Sushi Bar offers the best bargain you can get for such fresh sashimi. The thick cuts are soooooo satisfying for sashimi lovers. Besides salmon, I tried the salmon belly and swordfish sashimi. Both salmon and swordfish sashimi were fresh and sweet but the salmon belly cuts were not very good. 
hmm
Thick slices of fresh sashimi - sushi bar never disappoints!! 
It\'s soooo fresh so yummeh! #burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders
dinner situation here with ma werido friends and it was a shiok makmak affair.

Well.. You can never go wrong with sashimi on rice!
Generous cuts of fish with little rice, just the way it should be. Newly opened at Ngee Ann City! 
So satisfying!
The picture says it all.

I guess almost everyone knows. a great end to Saturday. \n<br />on another note, is @instagram down? I don\'t seem to load my feed.
The rice was cold and clumpy and the seafood average. At $29.30 including taxes, there are many other better options.

Not a crazy fan of Japanese food because most of the Jap food I\'ve tried are usually mediocre. However, Sushi Bar just made me fall in love with sushis, fresh sushis to be exact. Little pricey but it\'s worth the price. #sushi #japfood 
#food #foodporn #vscocam
I would say for the same price, shiok maki beats this hands down. 
All not bad especially the scallop carpaccio.
