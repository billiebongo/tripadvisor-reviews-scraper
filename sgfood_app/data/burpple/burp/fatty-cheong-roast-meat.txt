The meat is really getting very fatty!!! Not so nice anymore &gt;.
touted one of the best around. the chunky meat is well caramelized with a beautiful layering of meat and fats. enjoyable for sure but to say shockingly good when you first put into your mouth, kay lee still gets my vote
Finally tried this! Love the roasted meats. So hard to decide which is better . This or Sin Heng Kee?
Fatty Cheong\'s Char Siew Rice... For fatty Eleanor (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë) This BBQ pork is soooo good and oozing of aroma! Sweet &amp; meaty and the fats are glistening with flavour... $3 #burpple
Ultimate plate of Singaporean hawker man-food. Braised egg was extra. Juicy char siew, roast meat was tender with just the right amount of fat.
Back at Fatty Cheong for the Twin Pork Rice! Ôê∑ Crispy Roast meat and succulent char siew rice for dinner!
See how the fatty meat glistens! I don\'t really eat pork, but I do cheat on occasion when I want to eat wanton noodles! Living up to it\'s Fatty Cheong reputation, the well marinated char siew is thick and juicy, with the right amount of charred bits!
Char Siew &amp; Roast Pork Rice.
Springy noodles cooked to perfection and some gorgeous char siew, a sumptuous supper indeed!
Despite it being a slightly late lunch, there were 10 people in front of me in the queue for the Duck Noodles È∏≠ËÖøÈù¢($6.50).

If you still have space for more, try their shrimp dumplings, each contains a large juicy prawn!
