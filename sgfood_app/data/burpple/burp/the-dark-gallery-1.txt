~\n<br />·\n<br />Signature Dessert Platter\n<br />Chocolate Rhapsody - $18\n<br />·\n<br />Crafted for chocolate lovers with the signature dark, milk and white chocolate ice cream on a bed of chocolate soil and decorated with chocolate meringues, tuile and mousse.\n<br />·\n<br />The Dark Gallery\n<br />@discoverthedark
It was almost 1pm and who on earth eats desserts at that time? But anyways I went for this platter ($10) pricey IMO for the tiny servings. The pastries platter was sold out for the day and originally I wanted to try that out. Anyway the platter I ordered consisted of 2 itsy bitsy cutesy sized macarons, a small shot of hot chocolate and a scoop of ice cream. They were all ok tasting, nothing spectacular. I also ordered a Flat white ($5). The latte art was a fail but still, it looked cute. The coffee beans were from CMCR however I didn\'t quite like it. It had a weird sourish, almost too bitter note to it. The lady taking my order was very friendly and customer oriented. I\'ll come back but probably just stick to the chocolate offerings here. Waffles next 😂
Loved the chocolate soil so muchhh. The signature dark and milk chocolate ice cream were just insane💗
Platter at $12. But the must try are the icecream, $5 for one scoop.. choose the signature 80% dark chocolate!! #todiefor
Tartlet with 66% Ecuador dark chocolate ganache. Torched marshmallow with a 70% Dominican Republic dark chocolate on top. \n<br />They also offer their signature chocolate which is available in both iced [$8] and hot [$7]. I personally prefer the hot version which is super smooth. \n<br />A good balance of sweet + bittness on a platter. Chocolate lovers should pop by and try their various chocolate treats.
The Dark Gallery @discoverthedark prides itself as an artisanal dark chocolate boutique-café at Millenia Walk L1, where the perfect balance between bitter and sweet is found. Love the white chocolate for this.\n<br />.\n<br />Pick-me-up premium icecream served in a cup or cone at $5 (single scoop) or $8.50 (double scoop) is also available for a quick fix from a total selection of 12 flavours. Add $1 more for a baked chocolate waffle bowl. 🍫\n<br />.\n<br />Enjoy your long weekends!
Indulge in their single origin tasting platters such Single Origin Chocolate Pastries Platter ($12) as they take you to try chocolate from various countries such as 66% Ecuador tartlet or 70% Dominica Republic S\'more.
Where between black and white are not shades of grey, but brown.
While their dark chocolate ice cream on its own is pretty good, I\'m guessing freezing it in this Frozen Smores could\'ve been what caused it to turn out icy, way too hard, and not entirely as pleasant. The idea\'s pretty cool (which explains why I came back 4 times when they\'re always out of it!), but the chewy, dense torched marshmallows and stiff icy ice cream didn\'t gel that well with me. Perhaps a creamier and airier marshmallow fluff would\'ve worked better, a crunch in this — say the traditional graham cracker crumbled inside — would have helped tons too.
I\'m so in love with the sea salt butterscotch ice cream topped off with the caramelized almonds.
$9 \n<br />pouring the stuff in made the drink the most entertaining one i ever had
Single Origin Dark Chocolate Ice Cream Platter ($12)
Literally, for the rich— it was really quite pricey for ice cream. Great for chocolate-lovers because the chocolate taste was really really strong, and it got a bit \"gerlat\" after awhile. Not a bad experience, but doubt I\'ll come back to spend so much on just ice cream 😅
Check it out on the link in bio 👆in the meantime, here\'s a picture of their classy looking s\'more!
If you LOVE dark chocolate (and I mean really dark like &gt; 75%), then this is definitely the place for you. Go for their signature 80% dark chocolate ice cream I must say, or their single origin series if you\'re feeling all refined, or even their milk and white chocolate so don\'t worry if you can\'t appreciate their darker soul mates. 
Rich without being not too overtly sweet, it was a perfect foil to the vanilla ice cream. That being said, I’ve read raving reviews about their chocolate rhapsody so that’s definitely something I’m eyeing to try next time.😋😋\n<br />•\n<br />Conveniently located at millennia walk, its definitely a good choice for dessert if you’re in the area.
Chocolate Cube Hazelnut Latte ($9), a glass of frozen chocolate cubes along side a bottle of steamed milk and hazelnut espresso, you can choose how strong you like your latte to be. Full-bodied and smooth, this makes a great perk-me-up drink.

Probably the first of its kind in Singapore, The Dark Gallery at Millenia Walk @MilleniaWalk specialises in artisanal dark chocolate desserts and drinks.
Single-origin chocolates from all over the world, The Dark Gallery is perfect for chocolate lovers! Their signature 80% dark chocolate ice cream was so good, generally smooth (tho I did taste bits of iciness in some mouthfuls) and bittersweet. Paired it with salted peanut butter, in a chocolate waffle bowl that remained crisp for long. Pretty tempted to bring a pint of signature 80% home😛. 
A gimmicky cafe that serves dark, not too sweet chocolate, is as only as good as the quality of the drinks it serves.
I brought my friend to try the dark gallery after dinner as our dessert. Turns out the place was rather small so be prepared to wait for seats. The environment was Cafe like so it\'s really not conducive for eat and go which means longer unpredictable waiting time. The chocolate rhapsody we tried is a 3 flavored (dark, milk and white) chocolate ice cream bowl which goes well with the chocolate crumbs and meringue that the bowl comes with. It\'s a good balance without too much bitterness or excessive sweetness. I give it 5 stars.

\"Consuming chocolate is very much like being in love, but better. It fills you up and keeps your tummy happy too!\" — @thatgreedypig\n<br />-\n<br />The Chocolate Rhapsody ($18); one of the signature played desserts at @discoverthedark. Three scoops of The Dark Gallery\'s signature smooth and creamy dark, milk and white chocolate ice-cream on a bed of crunchy chocolate \"soil\", embellished with swirls of silky chocolate mousse, crispy chocolate meringue and shards of cacao tuile.\n<br />-\n<br />My favourite has got to be the (80%) dark chocolate ice-cream for its intense, bittersweet flavour.\n<br />-\n<br />#discoverthedark #thedarkgallerysg #milleniawalk #icecream #plateddessert
🍦🍦 Specialising in chocolate flavoured ice cream, I decided to opt for the non-chocolate ones, which was surprisingly good too! My pick was: Japanese matcha and Dark chocolate mint. Texture of both flavours were smooth, creamy, thick and dense which allowed prolonged enjoyment. The Japanese matcha was surprisingly distinct in flavour, a pleasant earthy note with a mild characteristic bitter undertone. Not the best matcha ice cream of course, but still enjoyable and not too sweet or milky. The dark chocolate mint had a bittersweet, rich cocoa flavour that withheld a lingering minty aftertaste that was cooling and refreshing. Personally prefer the Japanese matcha flavour (since I m a sucker for anything matcha) as boredom starts to kick in while I was halfway through the sphere of dark chocolate mint. If you are here for the first time, do give their signature dark chocolate ice cream a shot! Tried it on my previous visit and it was really really 👍🏻 [PS: 1 for 1 promotion ends on 31st July, only valid on weekdays!] .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
I love this combination 😊 I think we got a slightly bigger serving as it was the last available scoop!  Interestingly, it looked and tasted even darker then the signature 80% dark chocolate 😲 after eating this flavour, the signature one tasted more sweet! The Dominican Republic 70% single origin dark chocolate is good too 😁 Not a lot of us was able to appreciate the red velvet flavour, which reminded us a little like cough syrup/berries 😅
One of my fav dark chocolate ice cream from all the dark chocolate flavour available in stall. Intense flavour and bitter without losing it sweetness 👍🏼👍🏼
Both flavours are good, intense in its own flavouring. $5 per cup
With a focus on premium single origin dark chocolates, this new cafe at Millenia Walk specialising in artisanal ice cream and decadent chocolate desserts is a must-visit for serious chocolate connoisseurs. First-timers should go for the Chocolate Rhapsody ($18). A perfect introduction to what they can offer, the plated dessert features a scoop each of their signature ice cream (dark, milk and white chocolate), along with chocolate soil, tuille, mousse and meringue for an unparallelled party of textures and varying chocolate intensities. Share this with a friend to avoid chocolate overload! If you\'re looking for a little chocolate education, the Single Origin Platters (from $8) feature a curated line-up of chocolate pastries, ice-cream or drinks that will help you appreciate the nuanced flavour profiles, with a little help from printed tasting notes, of course! Otherwise, keep things simple with a scoop of their Artisanal Ice-Cream (from $5) — the Dark Chocolate is a favourite amongst the Burpple community for its deep and rich cocoa flavours. Pro tip: Approach the friendly and knowledgeable servers if you feel overwhelmed by choices — they\'ll gladly help you along.\n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
Overall quite impressed with the ice creams here, though we really wanted to try a lot of other stuff that was sold out early on a Sunday evening. 😩
Double Scoop ($8.50)
A chocolate x coffee cafe that will satisfy all the chocolate &amp; caffeine fans. I had the Chocolate Cube Hazelnut Latte that came deconstructed — chocolate ice cubes, cold milk, hazelnut espresso. The milk did not dilute the drink and the combination serves as a good afternoon booster!
Drop by if you\'re in the area. Happy Monday! #burpple #tingzieeats
Consists of 80% dark chocolate, 38% milk chocolate &amp; 32% milk chocolate. Love the dark chocolate the most, especially the bitter taste of it. Can\'t wait to go back for more!! 😍😋
The chocolate rhapsody comprised of 3 scoops of ice cream made up of 3 different types of chocolates: dark, milk and white, served along with meringues, tuille, chocolate mousse on a bed of chocolate soil crumbles. Best to share among at least 2 pax as the portion is rather huge and might get a tad overwhelming after awhile. My favourite flavour would be the dark chocolate, with its bittersweet cocoa flavour and a pleasant bitter undertone. Following up would be the white chocolate, with its luscious creamy, milky flavour and lastly the milk chocolate (personally not a fan of milk chocolate) that was  milky with a subtle chocolatey note. The texture of the ice cream were great, smooth, creamy and thick that allowed prolonged enjoyment. The chocolate soil crumbles added a pleasant crunch factor, along with chocolate tuille for an extra crisp factor and a bittersweet chocolatey note. Presentation was a plus point, intricately plated that resembled a fine dining concept. Though the ice creams were enjoyable for the chocoholics, this dessert lacked the wow factor which perhaps could be solved by having more toppings or other elements e.g. Waffles/brownies to be paired along with? 🤔 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
If you like it dark and bitter, you def should check out The Dark Gallery! Best part? They are having 20% discount for their opening sales!! Don\'t miss it :)
Absolutely love their 80% Dark Chocolate Ice cream!! It was creamy, bittersweet and rich. As a dark chocolate lover, I was so excited for it and it definitely met my expectations! 😊 the waffle dip cone is a must-have too!!!! There\'s a 20% discount storewide now for their opening sale. Don\'t miss it! :)
The Signature Toasted S\'mores here come with a Graham Cracker cookies and a dollop of their chocolate sauce. Overall, the S\'mores were pretty good; flame-torched slab of marshmallow that was light and airy with a fluff; none of that dense, sticky, overly sweet and gooey situation that is all too heavy to handle. The chocolate drizzle compliments the S\'mores nicely with its rich, cocoa flavours. While the Graham Cracker was a welcome addition with its crusty butteriness, the marshmallow doesn\'t melt onto the graham cracker the causing the two elements to seemingly feel a little unrelated. Still, it\'s not too bad, considering this was light and doesn\'t seem at all food coma inducing for a dessert of its calibre.
From The Dark Gallery at Millenia Walk; a new cafe set up in the middle of the aisle just beside Patisserie G serving up chocolate desserts — their main focus here seems to be their single origin chocolate platters which features a line-up of chocolate desserts/drinks from different origins so one can get to appreciate the variances in the flavours of chocolate sourced from different parts of the world. It is also noted that The Dark Gallery operates a number of branches in Malaysia as well.
The Dark Gallery uses blends from Common Man Coffee Roasters to brew their coffee. The Flat White comes with a rather heavy body, whilst being rather acidic; not sure if it was over-extracted here.
I ordered the single origin platter which consists of different dark chocolate ice cream flavour profiles from Brazil (62%), Ghana (68%) &amp; Tanzania (75%) respectively; while @storm77 ordered the platter consisting of chocolate pastries.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphotography #sgfoodphotography #foodstagram #sgfoodstagram #instafood_sg #sgigfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgmakan #sgmakandiary #burpple #burpplesg #thedarkgallerysg #dessertporn #sgdessertporn #dessert #sgdessert #chocolate #icecream #chocolateicecream #sgcafehop #sgcafe

I’ll be back @discoverthedark! Happy Boxing Day guys!
The chocolate ice-cream was nowhere as rich as the good ones I\'ve had elsewhere so far, while the Butterscotch had a strange gritty texture of ice shavings.
Mmmmm gonna try the darker one next round...
Why? Because it is sweet. It makes you smile. It makes you feel good inside.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Just like this waffle with hazelnut infused. Topped with 85% and 64% dark chocolate. Dark chocolate shavings sprinkling and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Yesss... everything chocolate!\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Desserts my favorite company when there is none.
If you love dark 🍫, this place is every chocoholics dream, moreso for their really dark choc (at least &gt; 70%). Over the years, we have majorly outgrown those really sweet and milky chocs into very bitter people 😅 Their signature 80% Dark Choc was rich, smooth and bittersweet, with a clean finish. Each mouthful was dense and luxurious, we will defo be back for their other choc desserts! Love that the boutique looks posh and cosy at the same time, complete with wood furnishings and gold highlights. We\'ll be back!\n<br />_______________\n<br />The Dark Gallery\n<br />9 Raffles Boulevard\n<br />#01-K5 Millenia Walk\n<br />Singapore 039596\n<br />.\n<br />#eatigosg #instafoodsg #eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #darkchocolate #sgicecream
🤔 And, you can have it in a beautiful #waffle cone (same price!). And, with toppings (+$1 for a choice of 2) too! 🙌 So rich, so #bittersweet, and oh so satisfying. 😋 If this is what the dark side is like, I\'m so there!
The dollop of dark choco ice cream brought joy to my tastebuds. Sprinkling of caramelised almonds. The waffle bowl has a dark chocolate lining. However, I did not quite like it simply because it lacked the crunch and crispyness. When bitten, it got stuck to the teeth. Hmmm... what a waste.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />I am not a pro neither am I an amateur. Sometimes my shots are nice and sometimes not fantastic. I like taking shots of what I eat. Everyday I am learning. I put in alot of effort to at least take presentable photos. If you like what you see, please ❤ cos every ❤ is a motivation to do better.

But I won\'t pay 💵S$7.50 for it here, ain\'t really worth it for something that can be created at home.

My favourite @discoverthedark is this Frozen S’more ($7.50). Ready your phones for an IG story; The Dark Gallery torches it upon order.\n<br />.\n<br />Ensconced within the thick layer of melted goo is a block of 80% dark chocolate ice-cream. Piercing in, your fork merges the warm marshmallow with the cold core that has a light coat of graham cracker crumbs. Bite into sticky, sweet satisfaction, tasting delightful cookie flavour and crunch.

Then torched to get that golden brown, alittle charred crisp facade. ◾◽\n<br />This is Smores. Marshmallow hugging dark chocolate ice cream. The marshmallow melts and gooeyness follows. Chocolate ice cream still a tad firm but not for long. ◾◽ I finished the ice cream but could not bring myself to polish off the marshmallow. Sweet and sticky... it is suitable for the super sweetoothers. Next time I will just stick to the dark side.
Too bad the dark chocolate ice cream was sold out.

But my favorites remain their Chocolate Cubes Hazelnut Latte and Dark Chocolate Mint Ice Cream (I\'m biased, I like anything dark choco). 🖤 😂 . .
If it will be as seductive as the shop\'s name. Ah... but I\'m afraid the chocolate is still not intense enough, maybe because it is still quite icy. If the texture is more smooth... at least I would have enjoyed it more. Bought with the Snatch app, so it\'s ok haha!
