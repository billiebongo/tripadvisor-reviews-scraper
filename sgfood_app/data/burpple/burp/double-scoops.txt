Banana creme Brûlée waffle $5.50 with speculoos $3.20 and sea salt gula Melaka $3.20
And yes, single scoop at @doublescoopssg AGAIN 😹
☺️ Ps: didn\'t know Double Scoops serves small bites too! 🍖🍗 Great news for @post_eatz! He gets to have his savoury food now while enjoy I my sweets. 😂👌🏻
Tried their yam orh nee, matcha and speculoos gelato which were great though a tad sweet. Waffles were average~ Still they have really interesting flavours like salted egg yolk too!
The toast was Gillette razor-crisp on the outside with a comfortably\n<br />buttery core while elsewhere, despite the Nutella layer appearing deceptively thin, it must possess natural abilities of permeation, diffusion or similar as you don\'t particularly notice its absence throughout the marvellously nutty proceedings. 4/5
Cause why not? \n<br />And is it against the norm to order single scoop @doublescoopssg? 😹 Super good Sea Salt Gula Melaka ice cream made from scratch! Though can\'t say the same for the slightly tough toast. 
Just speaks for how much we love the ice cream here. 😋 .\n<br />.\n<br />We tried their new item on the menu - shibuya honey toast with 4 scoops of ice cream. Hahahah!😆 Orh nee (I\'ll always have this whenever I\'m here!😋👍🏻), sea salt gula melaka, speculoos and not in pic, salted egg yolk (new)! 6th visit and definitely not the last. ☺️👌🏻
May be the orh nee(yam) and durian flavours.\n<br />I don\'t think the dish is memorable, although these ice cream flavours are said to be good. The location isn\'t that great too!
The mango lime was happily diverting, but the sparsely-populated charcoal waffle needed some nourishment which its (in one instance, ostentatiously monikered) inhabitants were helpless to do much about. 3.6/5
😳 So we thought of getting double scoops on a cone. But! One of the scoop fell off, therefore landed in the cup.😂 Hahaha! Quite a scene. 🙊 Well, at least I got my orh nee ice cream again~ 😋
Orh Nee (Yam) + Earl Grey + Waffle &amp; Maple Syrup = Happy Stomach 😄 》$9.70
When there is gelato, waffles is always around. After many rounds of trial and error, the waffles are not too bad. When you enter the shop, you get a sweet whiff of waffle.
I\'m pretty sure it\'d be \"I love waffles\" because who doesn\'t!
West siders to the North-East! Pretty adventurous  on Friday, since it\'s the Public Holidays - Election Day! Off to Double Scoops for some crispy waffles &amp; ice cream that were claimed of not having stabilizers so that they do not melt easily. Also, they have some flavors that do not contain egg, safe for egg-allergy customers 😊 the earl grey smells &amp; taste fragrant while the orh ni was an interesting flavor apart from the safe options we always order! 
Finally satisfied by cravings for waffle and ice cream after a month of procrastinating. Here\'s a nice, dainty cafe that is nicely tucked into the heartlands of Ang Mo Kio. Went there with two colleagues on a Monday afternoon and was quite delighted to see that no customers were around (had the place literally to ourselves). The guy and girl mending the the cafe were very pleasant and polite and went along with our crazy antics of trying out many of the flavors available (Hahaha). While I had sea salt gula melaka and chocolate macadamia flavors with waffle, one of my colleagues  had matcha and the sea salt gula melaka with his waffle. The waffles were decently good and the ice cream flavors were amazing! Will come back again one day:)
😌👌🏻 .
Must say I was quite excited to try the gelato here. Is it another Creamier/Fatcat? Verdict: Quite far from it, but not too shabby either. After trying some flavours, I settled for pistachio (rather average though) and sea salt gula melaka. The latter impressing me with the fresh distinct flavour of Palm sugar. The rum and raisin pales in comparison to the rest as it was slightly bitter and had a sorbet consistency. Orh nee could be better if it had a stronger yam flavour imo. A weird plastic smell wafted out from the kitchen when the waffle was being made, causing me to be slightly tense at how it will turn out. However, other than being plain, it was fine and very crispy outside. Pair it with the salted caramel to make it more palatable. The ice cream here takes forever to melt, making me wonder how much stabilisers they use! Overall I hope they will improve their flavours because there is quite a bit of potential! \n<br />Edit: Double Scoops clarified that their gelato \"contains very low dosage of stabilizer/emulsifiers\". And the reason it doesn\'t melt so easily was due to the \"super low temperature\" of their display set.
My first time at double scoops and I\'m impressed!! The red velvet cheesecake and orh nee flavoured ice cream were both good!!
Went to visit Double Scoops today to try out their waffles. Ofc, I ordered their signature orh nee ice cream 😊 It tastes surprisingly good! \n<br />Red velvet cheesecake blends well with orh nee ice cream, so the overall taste was great. 😋👍Will definitely come back again to try out more flavours.
Crispy and fluffy waffles! Nice and cozy cafe with really friendly staff.. can never get enough of their ice cream!!!
Finally a place in Ang Mo Kio where you can enjoy nice waffles and gelato while chatting with friends. It isn\'t crowded and pretentious.. The gelato is milky and rich. I\'d recommend the Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Sicilian Pistachio. Don\'t expect superb specialty coffee or beautiful latte art tho. The waffles are nice and crispy on the outside but could be fluffier on the inside.
The first thing my mum said, when she saw this. \"WAH!\" We loved that it came with the little flower/gem biscuits from our childhood days. Sadly, this flat white just wasn\'t cutting it, it was barely warm. I would say room temperature at best. \n
Sicilian Pistachio *premium* with waffle cone $4.70
Opening a few steps away from Kebun Baru Food Centre is Double Scoops, a parlour that offers both ice cream and coffee. Interestingly, their Salted Gula Melaka flavour uses gula melaka imported from Malacca! Classic flavours such as Rum &amp; Raisin are priced at $3.20 per scoop and $5.60/ $7.90 for double and triple scoops respectively, with an additional $0.50 per scoop for premium flavours like Red Velvet Cheesecake. If you want two flavours (as their name recommends), definitely go for the very authentic-tasting Orh Nee and roasty Sicilian Pistachio flavours ($6.60 for both).
The orh nee was a revelation, being starchy, thick and distinctively orh nee instead of merely yam, whilst the Sicilia pistachio tasted like it had enjoyed a few nice leaps over an open fire. Elsewhere, the waffle was as pedestrian and dry as the gravel on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, but once it made contact with the homemade caramel sauce the transformation was immediate, like Phay Pui Leng after she discovered Sephora. 3.9/5 
Finally one ice cream parlour that\'s nearer to home! The Waffles with Red Velvet Cheesecake and Pistachio ($10.20; $3.60 for waffle, $5.60 for 2 scoops &amp; +$0.50 each for premium scoop) was a good combination! Waffles was rather disappointing as it tasted rather floury and similar to old-school confectionery waffles except being slightly more plain. This was salvaged by the ice cream which didn\'t melt as easily! The Red Velvet Cheesecake had a strong taste of the original cake variant while the Pistachio\'s flavour was really intense!
Still salivating upon the thought of it! Yum yum orh nee and strawberry ice cream! 
Named the Cloud 9 Waffle, this was a fresh-spin cotton candy over a charcoal waffle. Rested on top was our top-up of a Tiramisu gelato. \n<br />IG-worthy but the cotton candy didn\'t add much extra dimension to the slightly dry waffle, especially after it started to collapse back into a sugar pillow. The distinct coffee taste in the tiramisu gelato was appealing though. Overall something worth the try for that cotton candy fun but do eat it fast while it is still cloudy-good. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #waffles #cottoncandy
// 🍞 taste: -100/5 Been a loyal fan of @doublescoopssg for its resemblance to the renowned thick toasts at After You, Bangkok. I have even recommended these to my friends and family members back in Singapore. .

Was contemplating between Yakult and Mango Cheesecake and eventually went for the latter 😋 They are real mango bits! Probably one of the tastiest cones I\'ve ever had but it was a tad bit brittle. #burpple #burpplesg #icecreamcone #mangocheesecake #doublescoops #sgfoodie #whati8today #onthetable #igsg #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgcafes #tslmakan #stfoodtrending

Both flavours of ice cream were amazing!

The inner texture of the waffle is too moist and not fluffy enough. :/ don\'t know why they have pop corn there as well. Lol

We ordered waffle with TRIPLE scoops with Nutella, Salted Gula Melaka and Peanut Butter @ $12.50. Verdict: ice cream was good but waffle was kind of too dense and cakey for our preference. \n<br />#cuisineparadiseeatout #waffle #icecream #burpple

The waffle has the fluffy texture inside, similar to A&amp;W type but lack of the crispy crust. The ice cream is power! Strong and intense in flavour with chopped nuts for the crunchy nutty feel. \n<br />Also tried its signature Or Nee ice cream but feel that it is a bit light in taste. The Sea Salt Gula Melaka ice cream is also another intense flavoured one.
Waffle. Ever. Died and went to heaven after eating this. Salted gula melaka #icecream with #waffle drizzled with #saltedcaramel sauce from new Double Scoops.

A scoop does not hurt the waistline
