I can only think of one other place that serve an equally good lemon curd tart (Windowsill in the Woods) which unfortunately is no longer around. The lemon curd of WY\'s tart is tangy, you could almost taste the freshness of the lemons. Love the texture, firm and yet moist. Perfect way to counter any jelatness, carbo-overdose effect!Life is good at Wheelers\' Yard...
Fusion means creativity applied in a good way, not if it taste weird or has a completely unrecognizable texture or form. Wheelers does their calamari using elements of marmite (black sauce), Japanese spice (‰∏ÉÂë≥) and then coated with a flour not usual for calamari or tempura. I think it\'s a fried chicken batter. Squeeze in the lime, it\'s a refreshing twist!
One of the better rendition of a deconstructed iced coffee. The key, make sure your expresso ball is really intense!
Visually, this is undeniably impactful: snowy-white warm milk cascading over the almost-black frozen sphere of potent espresso. Fortunately, its taste is well up to par; delivering deep aroma, a full-bodied flavour and strong caffeine kick.

A favourite from¬†Wheeler\'s Yard revamped menu, be utterly amazed by their¬†60¬∞C Chicken Breast ($17.90).
üåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩ\n<br />Corn and I - we go back a long way. I remember how happy it made me whenever my grandma boiled entire ears of corns for my brothers and I to munch on as a mid-afternoon snack. Impatient to get my teeth on the rows of sweet kernels, I would pay scarce attention to her words of caution as I tore off the scalding hot husks with my little fingers, blowing on them intermittently in an attempt to stave off the heat.\n<br />Well, I am thankful to have a less risky way to satisfy my corn cravings with this newly-launched side dish: Grilled Yuzu Mayo Sweet Corn ($7.90) at Wheeler\'s Yard.\n<br />The natural sweetness of the corn was enhanced by its time spent on the grill for sure. And when eaten with the combination of yuzu, creamy mayo, sprinkle of spice and spring onions it came dressed in, a veritable flavour bomb went off in my mouth. \n<br />Polite people can share but I am happy to hog a plate to myself üòÅ
Wheeler\'s Yard recently released their new menu about a month ago, which has infusions of both Japanese and Western cuisines. üç¥\n<br />This has got to be the best dish of the day. On normal days I would only opt for chicken breast as a \'healthy\' or \'simple/lazy\' option (cause I\'m lazy to pick out the bones); breast meat was never regarded as a \'tasty\' part. However, this chicken breast dish wipes all those presumptions away. Done sous vide style, the chicken breast was firm and packed with flavour. It was also tender and succulent, and did not contain any of the \'dryness\' that I would usually expect. The mash, burnt corn, and hazelnuts weren\'t just there for plating purposely but they created a plethora of textures - soft, wet, crunchy - accentuating the flavours of the chicken. \"Not just a pretty face\" indeed (Tan, 2016). If you\'ve been here before, you gotta try the new menu; if you haven\'t been here before, this is definitely worth your first trip to the back-end of Balestier. -\n<br />HeartyTastyWorthy: 3.5 / 5 / 4.5
Pleasantly surprised by Wheeler‚Äôs Yard revamped menu, I would definitely recommend having their Black Pepper Lime Squid ($14.90) on the side as each element was able to brighten up the dish. Emphasizing on delivering the best combination out of each ingredient used, the head chef, Arthur Ong shared that by keeping the natural flavours we get to taste the freshness of the squid. Coated in Japanese starch and 7-spice powder,¬†the batter was lightly crisp without being overly thick. Made with fish sauce, reduced and thicken with sugar, the lime-infused black pepper glaze drizzled over the golden fried squid also provided a nice flavourful punch. Overall, a great¬†pairing¬†of citrus and spice.
3.5 munchies: Plump and juicy oven-baked portobello on toasted sourdough; topped with cherry tomatoes and baby spinach. The drizzling of truffle oil and balsamic vinegar gave the freshness of the ingredients a punch of earthy, sweet-tart flavours. This wholesome sandwich makes a great brunch option for both vegetarians and the health-conscious cafe hoppers!
Cold silken tofu drenched in homemade irizake sauce with colorful toppings of crunchy leek slices, fish flakes and a generous amount of that addictive crisp Sakura ebi! It\'s like a level up from the more common cold tofu dishes with an additional nice touch of the taste of the sea. A great refreshing appetizer option to get your belly ready for the mains!
I rarely voluntarily choose chicken breasts during meals for fear of biting into a tough and rubbery piece of meat, but oh boy, I would head straight for it on my next visit to Wheeler\'s. Opting to sous vide fresh over frozen chicken definitely paid off as it turned out unbelievably juicy and tender. I loved that every other element on the plate was there for a purpose - they\'re not just pretty faces for plating! The grilled butter corn, nutty roasted hazelnut and buttery smooth homemade mash didn\'t just do their respective jobs well but married together with the star of the dish extremely nicely, providing a fun variation of textures and flavours. I dare say that this is one of the best chicken breasts I\'ve had and obviously, it is hands down the most memorable dish from the meal at Wheeler\'s Yard!
Was so amazed by the 60deg Chicken Breast (rightside). I was so wrong to think it looks like any plain chicken! With Chef\'s special marination method, the juice was all locked in and the pan-fry gives it a slight char. Brings a whole new level of my impression of chicken breast. Definitely Chef\'s pride. -$17.90\n<br />.\n<br />New head chef Arthur Ong who has loads of experience in top restaurants has injected quality food into this cafe. He is a strong believer of fresh ingredients, not frozen, and makes everything from scratch in-house. The Teriyaki Salmon Rice Bowl (leftside) was very tasty and i absolutely love the rice coupled with their homemade teriyaki sauce. -$16.90\n<br />.\n<br />Make instant reservations with @chopesg now!

One highlight of Wheeler\'s newly revamped menu is its emphasis on using quality ingredients to create its dishes from scratch. An example would be the pasta here tossed in homemade mentaiko cream, topped with a generous scoop of salmon roe. Those glorious orangey-red pops were helpful in elevating the overall dimensions of flavours on the plate. At the same time, perhaps reducing the creaminess and thickness of the sauce while making the mentaiko flavours more pronounced could help in pulling the dish back from being jerlat. Top up $3 on any mains for a salad bowl and a drink during weekdays, 12pm to 2.30pm.
Wheeler\'s Yard take on the \"Tropical\" and \"Exotic\" category of desserts featuring Homemade Coconut Panna Cotta, Butter Crumbs, Mango, Milk Foam and Passionfruit Coulis. A pretty refreshing dessert especially for those who prefer fruity desserts; the Panna Cotta was refreshing and lightly-flavoured ‚Äî pairs well with the more tangier fruits such as the mango and passionfruit coulis where it strikes a balance with the more intense flavours of the dessert. A classic combination done well.
The mains at Wheeler\'s Yard seems to be more of their forte than the desserts; the Yuzu Creme Br√ªl√©e came strangely with Matcha ice-cream and Azuki Beans over the top. The Creme Br√ªl√©e came with a thin, crackling layer of sugar over the top which was decent enough though much of the Creme Br√ªl√©e is flavoured by the zippy flavours of Yuzu. Sadly, most of the flavours get overwhelmed by the Azuki red beans and the Matcha ice-cream adds a whole lot of confusion in terms of flavour to the Yuzu Creme Br√ªl√©e. Perhaps this would be better if the Yuzu Creme Br√ªl√©e is left alone with candied Yuzu bits over the top for a simpler concept.
Chocolate lovers would probably love this one; consisting of homemade chocolate cake, chocolate ice-cream and chocolate frosting with fresh strawberries. The different textures and contrast of chocolatey notes are rather interesting for those who enjoy chocolatey desserts ‚Äî I would prefer that the chocolate cake be replaced with brownies for a more fudgey texture and intense flavour that is more coherent with the entire dessert in general.
Charred and pink, delightfully tender, those beef slices are gorgeously lie on a bed of Japanese rice, that may I add freshly de-husked upon ordering and air-flown from Japan. But honestly, the star would have to be the divine braised daikon. Literally, melt in the mouth, soft like tofu, bringing heaven closer to the heart. That onsen egg, runny and wobbly, making the rice smoother and creamier. \n<br />And now with so many beef bowl around, this bowl is certainly one of the better one.
Perhaps the better of the two when compared with the Miso Pork Belly Rice Bowl ‚Äî this one comes with Sliced Grilled Beef, Braised Daikon (which is sous-vide ‚Äî it\'s pretty much a recurring theme in most of the mains here), Onsen Egg, Homemade Suki Sauce, Shio Konbu and Spring Onions. The beef is carries a very slight gaminess here, but also carries a delightful charred flavour which goes amazingly well with the savory sauce drizzled over the rice. Daikon was subtly sweet and retained much of its juiciness, soft from the braising and also carried a lightly charred flavour. The rice was also pretty much worth mentioning ‚Äî you could feel every single grain and according to them, the grains are only husked when the rice is being ordered to retain the quality of the rice. Do mix the sous-vide egg to lace the rice and meat with golden yolk goodness ‚Äî the eggs used here are of AA grade which are of a high grade with also bigger yolks as well.
Possibly one of the most surprising dishes we have had here for it exceeded our expectations. Sous Vide Chicken Breast served with Grilled Butter Corn, Roasted Hazelnuts, Shio Konbu and Homemade Mashed Potato, the Sous Vide Chicken was cooked at a temperature of 60¬∞C and was surprisingly succulent, juicy and tender ‚Äî very similar to thigh meat and perhaps one of the best chicken dishes I have had in a while. There is also quite a good balance of flavours here where you could taste a little bit of the sear which is subtly done without the ruggedness you would expect from a hawker stall on a chicken chop. The various other elements also helped in making this dish more balanced by adding more dimensions of flavour such as the nutty hazelnuts and foam and charred, buttery corn bits ‚Äî very interesting elements that worked surprisingly well with one another. A dish highly-recommended if have yet to try Wheeler\'s Yard!
This is my absolute favourite. 
One of the new items in the revamped menu of Wheeler\'s Yard which seems a little bit more Japanese fusion than the previous menu. Spaghetti with Mentaiko Cream (made fresh in-house) with salmon roe on the top. The Mentaiko Cream is pretty thick, creamy and subtle savoury which gives this pretty hint of umami flavour to the pasta, made even better with the addition of the roe which gives another round of umami goodness when burst. Perhaps they could hold back a little on the amount of cream sauce per serving for the Mentaiko Pasta; it gets a little too creamy and jelat after a while for how thick it is.
I would probably say these are great for a starter or a light snack; these strips of sweet potatoes gave an ample bite whilst achieving a good balance carrying its own natural sweetness yet with a savoury soy sauce with enough flavour to counter the sweetness of the potatoes.
Indeed Finger Lickin\' Chicken these are; using mid-wings for the fried chicken it is marinated with a couple of spices as well as potato starch to help soften the chicken meat to make it tender. The meat falls off from the bones easily, and the batter was crisp without being overly thick. The chili dip on the side is made with a mix of three different types of chili as well as Tabasco ‚Äî certainly gives the mid-wings a flavourful punch with its moderate level of spiciness!
This crispy babies are lightly battered, allowing you to have a bite more from the meat (which is juicy. Plus point for splitting the mid wings into two, making nibbling so much easier. And that dipping sauce is seriously sedap. Made from scratch, from four type of Chili, it\'s have that pow-wow kick while a small tiny hint of sweetness. My kind of Chili, that I swear goes well with anything. Very local, very delicious.
Wheeler\'s Yard have just launched their new menu! If you haven\'t try their new dishes, come on down, don\'t missed out on the goodness! 
Aglio Olio portion just right with soup of the day/salad and drinks only at $19.90. Ambience is pretty vintage yet classy with the bikes in the middle of nowhere, hanging on the walls or on the table. A long meeting table for big companies of friends to meet and catch up. So Instagram worthy this place! 
Really tasty crispy waffles with butter and honey. Goes so well with the hot chocolate that is not too sweet
Egg Benedict. Flat white &amp; cappucino. Truffle fries. üòªüòª the food is not\n<br />Too bad but it is a little bit too expensive though.

Sek says its of a good consistency...well i like it too :) 
TBH im pretty disappointed. 1. Spaghetti wasnt al dente - OVER üòï 2. The bacon wasnt seared enough - it was pale and the FAT üò± 3. Cream was a little bland and a tat too watery üòß Verdict: try something else on the menu üò£üò£
1. Caffe Latte: Sek says its alright~ a little on the sweet side 2. Ginger Lemonade (homemade): ü§î Definitely refreshing for a warm afternoon üòé a little more ginger taste would be awesome
While certainly pricier than most cafes, Wheeler\'s Yard does put out dishes with more finesse than others. I mean, look at that pretty plate üòÇ
Burgers are just great comfort food. Warm to the touch and a meat lovers dream, there\'s something primal about grabbing those buns and stuffing it in your mouth. (Wait, I just reread that...) Toasty buns, lettuce, caramelized onions, crisp bacon, homemade pickles, cheddar and beef INFUSED WITH WAGYU FATS, cause why not right? The burger was gooooooood, but the onsen egg while a welcome addition to any dish was slightly impractical here. My friend just popped the whole thing into his mouth to avoid a sloppy mess. \n<br />Slightly pricey at $26.90 but well worth it for that juicy patty that\'s just a party in your mouth. \n<br />#bodyplump #Burpple #BurppleSG #whyidonthaveabs #foodporn #cafehopping #cafe
Food wasn\'t that bad, other than that the Carbonara was a bit wayyy too creamy &amp; thick. The steak was really good! Never actually liked Medium Rare done-ness but it made me think twice about it! Nachos were pretty good to snack on tho! Awesome combi with the cheese. Ordered Lemonade &amp; it was nice &amp; refreshing. Total Bill was: $76+
Sgd 6.00\n<br />What I like about this cake is it was simply fudgy luscious, the bittersweet taste really melts in your mouth üòã. Nice to try!\n<br />Recommendation:üç¥üç¥
The grilled chicken chop here had always been decent enough with its homely cooking style that saw the chicken being smothered in a tasty brown sauce. However, with the hire of the head chef who hails from Fat Cow (yes, THE Fat Cow restaurant), there\'s been a noticeable shift in the cuisine direction. For starters, he has injected sophistication and elegance into a few of the existing dishes including this one. From the artistically-skewed plating style to more finely-tuned flavours, it is apparent an evolution for the better is happening. The chef has also implemented several make-from-scratch processes in the kitchen which I feel, really makes a difference to the taste of what\'s eventually placed in front of me. Judging by this grilled chicken dish alone, I can\'t wait to find out the other pleasant surprises he\'ll be pulling out of his chef\'s hat. üòÑ
Distractingly fragrant with bacon, this is a rare carbonara I genuinely enjoy. The sauce hits the point of creaminess that suits me well, being not too thick nor watery. Also, because the chef cooks it with stock, it doesn\'t thicken as it cools making it \"jelak\" to eat after a while. Done al dente, the fusilli was a little firm and pleasantly chewy which is how I prefer my pasta. The highlight though has to be the gorgeous onsen egg. When broken, it let flow glorious goldenness all over. Perfect!
The egg benedict was pretty average though I do applaud them for the flowy egg yolk because at least this was executed nicely. The coffee was okay too. Pretty average. Come here only if you\'re into taking pictures of the creative interior of the cafe.
exactly what is needed for a chilly weather.
yard burger 2.0 from the hands of ex fat cow\'s head chef i heard. every component compliment each other nicely but careful to let just let the juicy wagyu fused patty\'s flavor shine through. topped with a perfect poached egg to wet down everything further. o the smokey in-house made bbq sauce by the side is really so not necessary
#imnotthebridetobe Lovely place, though the self service system left us confused and our food was being served wrongly. üò≥ But wells, at least I have good company!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Medium sized fillet of sea bass fish, with a crispy skin and tender flesh.
Large chunks of fresh squid, coated in a thin, crisp Asian spice batter, served over thick, sweet kecap manis with spring onions.
Rather decent, love the perfectly poached eggs and thick house made hollandaise sauce.
It costs :15.90+                                                            Tastes like: 11.90+                                                         Review: Who likes some big yummy mushrooms hands up! They\'ve got a good serving of them inside this dish which was pretty much the highlight of the dish for me. The Risotto itself was decent, and the Aragula added a nice tangy feel. Portion size was moderate, but probably not enough for a hungry biker. I liked the dish, I just didn\'t think it was worth that much money, or the long walk for bike-less folks. 
I am very fond of pesto and have relished it in pastas, salads and other dishes. If my memory doesn\'t fail me, this was my first time encountering it in a risotto though. Well, the striking jade green carb turned out to be pretty enjoyable. While the pesto flavour came across boldly, the grains were slightly soft to the bite as compared to other risottos I\'ve had elsewhere. Personally, I do prefer a more al dente chewiness but with the garnishing of grated Parmesan, crisp baby arugula, pine nuts and sweet tomatoes, there was plenty of extra texture and facets of flavour brought to the dish. The portion is generous, so it\'s great for sharing. Those with a hearty appetite will of course prefer to slurp it up solo.
One of my fav cafes! The entire combination was just so good! üòç Nice ambience too 
hulk approved pesto risotto from wheeler\'s yard. but why so little love for awesome plate of vegetarian grub? granted the arborio rice is al dente but bordering tough that day, it lends a lovely texture amidst the molten basil pesto sauce. and so so many button mushrooms! freaking quite divine to me actually!
What\'s there not to like about a light, crunchy waffle topped with ice-cream and covered in dark chocolate sauce and sweet, juicy berries? Yes, even after I polished off my main course of panfried salmon with mashed potatoes and half a bowl of truffle fries, I still managed to have space for this. 
Super in love with their in store ambience. A good chilling place. Food wise so so only. The waffle ice cream is the best food I have eaten so far in wheelers
J and I enjoyed some gd music with Senheisser sample headphones over a gd cuppa coffee. \n<br />It\'s Monday but it\'s PH! Enjoy all! üòÑ
Chunks of bananas that are just ripe enough grace this perfectly executed buttermilk waffle. Its exterior was lightly crunchy while its interior was fluffily soft yet not overly airy. The combination of the bananas, fresh strawberries, a generous amount of ooey-gooey salted caramel sauce and crunchy walnuts with the waffle created a sublime impact on the tastebuds.
Had a long walk from TPY mrt station to this place so I rewarded myself with a latte and the berry yogurt cake! Latte was alright but coffee taste can be stronger. It came with traditional meringue biscuits so I thought it was quite heartwarming. The cake was light  and not too sweet! Very nice place to slack in the afternoon.. 
Only the best.
Good place, nice food but the location is quite far from the city. 
Definitely a must try, this Japanese style fries is unique with the mentaiko mayo 
Fries came with Bonito Flakes, crispy and not overly greasy. However the Mentaiko mayo lacked the mentaiko flavor. Would prefer it to have a stronger mentaiko taste to it
We had the Wheeler\'s Yard Big Breakfast ($17.90), Smoked Salmon &amp; Scrambled Eggs ($17.90), Prawn Aglio Olio ($19.90), Truffle Fries ($14.90), Otah Burger ($16.90), Iced Fruit Punch ($4.00), Cappuccino ($5.00) and Latte ($5.00). Missing from the picture is the Otah Burger ($16.90) which took appx 15min to prepare. The food was average but love the ambience with high ceiling, and surrounded by beautifully crafted bicycles.
If I say we helped the waitress clean the plates, would you understand? Everything was pretty decent that we had no leftovers. 
Overall yummy but nothing too special. I liked the fries though! They were basically wedges disguised as fries. 
This was one of the reasons we came back here again! Had the fusilli this time I think I still prefer it with spaghetti but it was good nonetheless. 
Lovely, high ceilings with wide spaces but what\'s with the out-of-place EDM tracks blasting?
Solid and chunky cod with the sauce that goes so well together. I love the varieties of veggies that came together. Portion was big and the atmosphere was just right. 
Delicious fluffy waffles with chocolate ice cream, berries and sinful chocolate sauce. Sipping my cup of coffee, sharing the waffle with the bf in this laid back cafe was perfect!
Finally got to drop by Wheeler\'s Yard after a while due to its inconspicuous location at Balestier, it is too cumbersome to traverse by bus or mrt. Went there with Dad by car if not I probably would not make a trip down here myself. 
Generous yummy and the salsa is really tasty and fresh! Doesn\'t need the added chili, it\'s already substantial.
This dish is so NOT your typical cafe fare. Firstly, that is one honkingly large piece of cod fish, its cottony-soft flesh embellished with the subtlest of searing. Tagging along are roasted capsicum, lotus root and haricot verts (also known as the supermodel of French beans). All wallowing happily in a pool of lemon butter sauce under which a pile of creamy potato mash lurked. For the price, the portion was way bigger than I expected too.

Food is average as many has reviewed. Was really looking forward to the nice interior however was kinda disappointed as they only had bicycles laid out. But place was spacious recommended if you wan a place to chill :)
The flavour of the matcha was not that strong, so it\'s suitable for those who like green tea but prefer it subtler. What\'s also pleasing was the contrasting light, creamy texture of the matcha green tea mousse with the crunchy hazelnut base. 
Those large, fresh and succulent prawns were superb. Chef didn\'t play coy with the spiciness level either which is a good thing. I don\'t like it when they wimp out. #wheelersyard #cafesg #sgcafe #cafefoodsg #cafehoppingsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #pasta #fusion #seafoodpasta #burpple
Those large, firm and succulent sea tiger prawns (de-shelled save for the tail) were the highlight for me in this lipsmackingly tasty fusion pasta. That, and the fact the chef didn\'t play coy with the chilli level, so there\'s a fiery kick in the house-made sambal sauce. I was also pleased that the fusilli pasta (you can opt for spagetti too) was cooked perfectly al dente. 
It\'s not really spicy at all and there\'s a sweet tomato taste. I guess it\'s because they put cherry tomatoes inside. Prawns are nice and succulent just like what the menu states.

$14.90, loved how potatoey and crispy it was, and the amount of cheese on it. Could do with more truffle taste.
Lemon tart, banana walnut, chocolate truffle. Nothing spectacular, chocolate truffle seems to be a safe bet and everyone\'s preference. Loved the fact that the banana walnut had a layer of chocolate fudge but texture and taste wise pretty normal, we thought that it tasted a bit like huat kueh..? Someone complained the lemon tart was too sour but it was alright to me. I\'m not a fan of it in general and my friend says it could be improved. So I guess food really isn\'t their strong suit
Yummy waffle with banana and a scoop of ice cream üåº Tasty n delicious üòã
One of my frds brings me there to have coffee ... yesss ... i love d coffee n deco ... somemore u can listen songs with sennheisser headphones ... 
Decent rendition with a generous amount of creamy hollandaise sauce, thick pieces of honey-baked ham and cooked spinach. Don\'t you agree that there\'s something mesmerising about broken yolks cascading over a terrain of hollandaise sauce-covered poached eggs? For me, this visual is very much a part of the whole experience of eating an eggs ben :)
Wheeler\'s Yard is a pretty place which people visit for the environment more than for the food. The prawns were fresh but I feel that the quantity given did not match the price I paid. There was nothing special about it that I would come back again for. 
Not overly sweet and with a lovely maltiness, the crumble piled on top gave the whole tart a captivating crunch. I like this especially with a glass of iced chocolate.
Truffle fries is crispy but too oily. The spaghetti is so so only &amp; the top shells got a fishy smell. Will only go back for coffee.üëçüëç
Bf ordered this. Some ham &amp; cheese bread thingy.\n<br />Oh the fries is good! I have a thing for flavoured fries! Overall, 6/10
Ordered Nachos to share. I seriously love the nachos here! The nachos cheese tasted super good. Except for the other condiments that was given. Overall, 7/10
First visit to Wheeler\'s Yard! It\'s a cool rundown place located in the middle of an industrial estate. I love the way they decorated the place. I guess it would be nicer at night. 
Love the environment - comfortable and spacious. Went around 5pm on a Saturday, wasn\'t that packed yet. The coffee was good, aromatic. There were cakes and pastries, but have yet to try them out. Ordered the chicken with mushroom sauce and asparagus, sauce was quite salty, didn\'t manage to finish it. Overall, a good place for a catch up with friends and family. Will drop by again. 
If you fancy a warm grilled sandwich, this is pretty good. The crisp bread complements the ham and melted cheese squished inside, while the tasty sweet sauce adds a spark to the savouriness.\n<br />Those fries should come with a warning label; they are terribly addictive! Being super crunchy and flavour-packed, they also prove to be a magnet for hungry fingers that aren\'t yours.
Coffee was much more satisfying ‚Äì I got a skinny cappuccino ($5) with less milk and they managed to get the ratio right (too much milk makes me sick, I‚Äôm such a weakling). I always admire the coffee art on my coffees and it almost makes me want to be a barista just to learn how to create those magical patterns.
After about 5 minutes of standing in front of the dessert counter, weighing between the apple crumble, chocolate truffle or lemon meringue tart (there wasn‚Äôt a dessert section on the online menu) we chose the lemon meringue tart ($7.50). I popped off to the bathroom and when I came back turns out my mom had ordered the chocolate truffle cake ($6) as well because you can only pay with visa for payments above $20. Good excuse.
I was very happy with the portion size of my salmon but it was a tad too overcooked and though the gravy that came with it went quite well with the side of creamy mash, it didn‚Äôt complement the salmon. I tried my mom‚Äôs chicken and I preferred it to mine. The chicken was tender plus it came with mushrooms. Maybe next time I should listen to the menu (the chicken was a chef‚Äôs recommendation).\n<br />(full review up on my blog feuillettte.wordpress.com)
I said no mash they said they will add vege but I don\'t see much green at all. Not the best.
My first visit here, was very impressed by the huge space and despite the crowd, it didn\'t feel too cramped or stifling. Very energetic and vibrant vibe with the colourful helmets and sporty bike displays mounted on walls. Food was okay, quite reasonable priced for the portions and their menu was quite extensive. Good place for a friends\' gathering!
As everyone said, ambiance over the food. The meal was like soak wt oil, but bacon not even hv a lil\' crisps. Unique ambiance that worth to try.
A short getaway to an old warehouse for a relaxing coffee and some snacks! Interesting place with a nice ambient.. Ordered the truffle fries and breakfast set.. Must go for a relaxing weekend!
(+) only for insta/pic: (-ve) not worth the price, food quality is really bad. Better off headin to Robertson Q - same price, but way much better!
Forgot to take a picture before I split the double patty Hum Bao Bao..
Love the spaciousness of this place. Great place to bring family here especially kids. Had a big breakfast and scramble eggs with salmon. Portions is filling and taste above average. Would come back to this place for a drink again as the setting and spaciousness is lovely. 
Spacious place with plenty of seating (huzzah!) in the middle of nowhere where you can even buy a bicycle or two.
The lemon tart is quite the yummy. Coffee is alright, service is slow. 
Slightly translucent and gelatin-like in appearance, the generous filling was zinged up with lots of lemon. The tart base was thin but not the hard crisp sort. This is the type of dessert I tend to crave on a hot day.
And my quest for banana cakes continues.... This was the one I had at Wheeler\'s Yard. Its less conventional sliced cake shape surprised me but boy, did it taste good! That thick layer of rich dark chocolate was an absolute delight - a perfect complement to the moist banana cake. 
If you like escargot, you will probably like this as they both are very similar in texture. Nicknamed \"the poor man\'s escargot\", the top shell gets the fancy treatment for a change, and is cooked French-style, meaning it\'s saut√©ed with loads of butter, garlic and onions. Personally, I find this very suitable for sharing when having drinks with friends.
Derived from the Hokkien dialect meaning \"black as black can be\" (or something along those lines), the description actually refers to the specially-made savoury and sweet \"kicap manis\"sauce. It made for a formidable pairing with the calamari. Speaking of the calamari, I was pleasantly surprised to see how generous in size they were. Having been swooped through a batter and very quickly fried to a golden crunch, it tasted very fresh and not at all rubbery. We all were not shy to fight for the last piece because it was \"sibey ho jiak\"!
Crispy, crunchy chicken wings served with home-made Thai chilli sauce can do no wrong. Reminiscent of \"har jeong gai\", this truly lived up to its name. 
I love it when a new chef comes on board because they tend to refresh the menu with lots of new items. This is the case with Wheeler\'s Yard\'s head chef Calvin Khoo. After working closely with the management, he has launched a menu to coincide with the bicycle cafe\'s extended operating hours. Featuring a mix of bar food, pastas and main courses, there are more than a few of them that fall into the bistro/restaurant category. The Black Mussel Bowl is one such example. Saut√©ed with garlic, onions and A LOT of white wine, I found this to be delicious although the mussels were the thin-shell variety which meant some breakage during cooking. However, the management are already sourcing for new suppliers so that\'ll be sorted out soon enough. IMHO, the fries were especially great when soaked in the mussel-enriched gravy. \n
üòçüòç Having our brunch before heading back to office for some work. #vscocam #brunch #withlove
I had the bolognese pasta and it was a bit too al dente for me and clumpy , the layout and concept was good. The cheese fries tho were soooo good. Good place to catch up with friends . It has an hipster element to it as well 
The scrambled eggs is too milky for my liking. And I don\'t think it\'s worth the price. $19.90
Passion Fruit cake, orange and cream soda, cranberry and hibiscus juice. Refreshing ~~
The chicken tasted very nice but i like its sauce the best! It is worth every penny! :)
decided to give this place another chance because we were too lazy to travel far. looked what happened. a very unwashed cuppa of mocha. turned off. no sense of customer retention and only a changed cuppa. can complain anot? HAHA
Grilled Chicken ($17.90) - nicely grilled chicken with french beans, grilled tomatoes and mashed potato.
Nice to look at.. Not so good in taste.. #burpple #foodporn
Heard that this place is usually crowded during the weekends but it was surprisingly empty when I went over on a Wednesday afternoon. The food was alright, nothing fascinating however the ambience of the cafe was good. Expect some noises because it\'s just beside a factory. The place is spacious. I ordered their beef burger while my colleague had their all day breakfast and she added smoked salmon. We ordered mocha and it comes with our favorite childhood biscuit (the colorful icing on top) and it goes pretty well with the coffee. The mocha kinda lack of the taste of coffee. 
There is only that many lattes I can down in a day. So when I hit my caffeine quota, I like to go for an iced chocolate. For me, it has to be made with proper drinking chocolate powder. Yes, it is more work for the barista to stir the powder till it dissolves. But using a syrup doesn\'t quite give it a rich enough chocolate flavour. There are some things you can compromise in life but not when it comes to drinking chocolate.
The 2 beef patty was a let down. One was well done while the other was more of a medium which was fine. But both had a strong odour of sour-ish beef. The fries though are pretty good! Crispy and full of potato! The iced mocha was good too, can taste the aroma of the coffee beans!
Couldn\'t resist trying this new item on the menu after I was hit by the aroma of truffle from another customer\'s order of this dish. The fries are crisp on the outside and soft-potatoey on the inside. Nice touch with the finely grated parmesan cheese topping too.
Instagram-worthy drinks that are perfect for our sweltering heat. The cider is quite strong so don\'t be deceived by the innocent looking fresh strawberries and mint leaves. I tried both the pear and berries flavours and up to now, I still can\'t decide which one I prefer more. Both are good.
Amazing decor, loved the feel of the place - a great place to chill out with friends. BUT the food is rather average. 
Tried this for the first time upon recommendation by the young lady who helps to run the place. The sauce was a tad salty for me but overall, I liked it. They use the thigh meat of the chicken so it\'s really tender and juicy, and the grilling is evenly done. The accompanying skinny French beans, baby tomatoes, grilled mushrooms and mashed potato were also good.
This refurbished warehouse has been generating a buzz since it\'s doors opened as a sprawling bike shop and event space that conveniently serves coffee and food too. A lovely spot to relax on the weekend, come and check out the bicycles with your friends, and wind down with a simple coffee. Don\'t expect bells and whistles, it\'s a bike shop after all!

Some of you might feel that this small little cuppa is a little overpriced, but I think it was the best coffee I\'ve tasted. The caramel and coffee blends together so well and the sweetness of the mixture tastes just right. Totally hit the right notes! :) 
Having a cup of cappuccino to warm ourselves! üòä
This is smoked salmon buttery croissant, priced at $13.90nett.
The food is nothing to shout about but its airy, industrial factory space will make it an attractive photo-op.

Smoked salmon breakfast at wheelers yard tasted great. Rather big servings. 
Wheeler\'s yard, the cafe you ought to visit. I like the spaciousness and good ventilation. Dislike the long waiting time for food and drinks. Very nice chillout place nevertheless üîñ
Wheeler\'s Yard is a relative newcomer on the scene but has made quite a stir since it\'s arrival. Located in an industrial park off Balestier Road, this spacious venue is a hipster\'s dream! We say sky\'s the limit for couples who are willing to flex their creative muscle and work some industrial chic magic in this space. Do note that at the moment, you will need to hire an external caterer if you decide to hold your event here. 
a big breakfast anytime, any day!
always enjoy ur latte with old school fish snacks!
Sweetly tart acidity with a syrupy mouthfeel, suggested by the roasted almond syrup. It has a dry and savory edge flavor, which I would not recommend for those who dislike the taste of almond. 
The coffee had a mild flavour and a slightly drying finish. It only looks good to check out the cafe for it\'s photogenic space, but definitely not for the food and coffee.
All day big breakfast. Interesting how they placed the chilled butter in the middle of the meats, so it melts and can be spread on the butter.
Slowly crossing off the list of cafes to visit.. This is our first stop of the day at #wheelersyard
Weekends are for catching up with old friends at #wheelersyard
Another surprise winner from the New and Improved menu at Wheeler\'s Yard. Nice and crisp on the outside yet still tender and moist within, the salmon sang sweet harmony with the accompanying golden honey mustard sauce. Lovely!
Ok, this was a really pleasant surprise. After reading quite a few less-than-favourable reviews of the food here, I was prepared for an average meal at best. However, this ribeye exceeded my expectations. It was incredibly juicy and done to exactness. I was floored by the attention the chef gave to the sides - perfectly saut√©ed crunchy French string beans, a whole baked potato topped with sour cream, chives and bacon bits, and grilled sweet baby tomatoes. For just $26.90 nett, I think this is pretty good value for money. 
The big breakfast looks simple but is yummy. Bacon crispy yet not dry and the sunny side up and yolky and smooth. I ordered a roasted almond as well and is good. 
An impromptu decision brought us to this fairly new place @ Balestier. Very limited food choices but quite decently done. Come here to soak in the ambience and enjoy the serenity of dining (or chillaxing) in an unusually large comfortable space 
Whether you\'re an avid cyclist or not, there is bound to be something for you to love here - the vast wide space, the rustic warehouse setting that resembles an aircraft hanger, the cool serene indoor chillax space, bicycles and gadgets for sale, a small menu of food...  lovely themed cafe, tucked away yet not quite inaccessible ;)
My friend who ordered this, loves the fact that both the chicken and beef burger patties here are hand-made by the resident chef. He swears you can really taste the difference! The consensus is the portion is surprisingly generous for $12.90 too. 
Redolent with the aroma of mushrooms, this soup is like a potent expresso.  Love how chock-a-block it is with minced mushroom bits. The garlic bread on the side is a bit adventurous as it has some spices mixed in for that extra kick.
Bike warehouse and cafe is super cool and hipster. Lol #hipster #cafe taken with the #htcOne

Nice waffles
The warm milk drips drips on the iced espresso ball. Melts .. so slowly.. the coffee and milk became a perfect marriage in iced coffee paradise.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />The strong aroma and the bitterness totally suited my palate. This was truly slurp-worthy.
hunting for a place that is hidden from the main road. Having scrutinizing the menu, I zoomed in on the yuzu creme brulee.\n<br />üî∏üî∏ A sunny burst of color from the creme brulee. Matcha ice cream and redbeans lying on the torched caramelised sugar that resembles a frozen pond. With a spoon, I whacked the top and a nice \"crack\" sound was like music to my ears. But alas, on a personal note, it was just too sweet. Custard was sweet so was the ice cream and more sweetness from the torched sugar.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />This would suit those (especially the younger customers) or the sweettoothers. I could not and did not finish this. Positively, it was pretty looking.
#burpple
Other than the tender sliced beef, the braised daikon and homemade Suki sauce balanced it with a subtle sweet-savoury combination. Of course chilling over a relaxing meal under the rustic roof of the yard made it more enjoyable for a lazy weekend morning. #burpple #burpplesg #foodporn #sgfoodies #singaporefood #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodspotting #sgfoodunion #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #burpproved #ricebowl
If I could quote from Masterchef program, this 60 deg sous vide cooked chicken breast was \"cooked to perfection\" and tasted so tender. The taste was well-complemented by the sweet corn pur√©e and elevated by those fragrant roasted hazelnuts. This was 1 dish that made me want to return to try the other items on their menu. #burpple #burpplesg #foodporn #sgfoodies #singaporefood #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodspotting #sgfoodunion #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #burpproved #sousvide

When paired with its flavorsome black sesame gravy that infiltrates every grain of rice and the gooey onsen egg that is raring to burst out in anger, such a combination will prove to be irresistable to most
‚òïÔ∏è
The subtle tartness and incredibly velvety texture just add that zing to every bite.\n<br />The radiance of the salmon roe and the gratification you will get when it burst delightfully in your mouth hugely amplify the favour of the pasta

Well, the beef patty is now infused with Wagyu fat, making it far juicier than before. Secondly, the pickles and newly-introduced barbecue sauce (served on the side but please feel free to slather it in your burger) are both made in-house. Even the way the buns are grilled has been changed. In short, I find this burger much tastier than before. It\'s really the attention to details that make the difference. #veronicaphuaeats #wheelersyard #burger #burpple #cheeseburger #sgcafe #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #BurppleTastemaker

My verdict: Not so delicious waffle paired with a scoop of refreshing dark chocolate ice cream topped with fresh berries and chocolate sauce drizzled all over. If not for the overly crisp and dry waffle, I would definitely free up some space in my stomach for another serving. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdesserts #dessertsg #waffles #icecream #wheelersyard

Friend liked this acidic cup of mocha. I don\'t know. I liked the idea of iced gem biscuits
They offer a wide variety of mains such as pasta, burgers, steak, grilled chicken, fish &amp; chips, etc.. The beef yard burger is reasonably priced at $15 but I felt that it tasted pretty average. In order not to avoid a wasted trip, take note that they are closed on Mondays! #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie #burpple #sgcafe #sgfoodiary #instafoodsg #cafehoppingsg #Burger

I read reviews about them having watery mocha, so I chose the safe option- latte. There was nothing spectacular about the coffee. It came with two pieces of jewel biscuits instead of the usual caramelised biscuit like in other cafes. It was creative but, unfortunately, the jewel biscuits did not go well with the latte.

Is it too early to have one?
A very cool space. Ambience was good. However the croissants turn a bit hard after awhile. A place worth taking cool pictures

saw my latte on their counter and it took them roughly 10mins to buzz me for my latte; result, room temperature drink 
Great colour so no filter is needed
If not for the unstable wifi connection (works perfectly fine for my iPhone, but not my laptop), I would have stayed through the afternoon. I love how eccentric this place is, staring at bicycle parts as you\'re sipping a cup of coffee. I love it even more that it\'s spacious and well illuminated, and doesn\'t compromise the seating capacity for business profits. Coffee\'s pretty good too. Quite a lot of people considering the inaccessible location. #wheelersyard #industrialchic #cafe #workfromcafe #cafehopping

Nice ambience doesn\'t make up for bad coffee and bad service. 1.5 hours for food plus wrong order is not acceptable. üò°

Really pleasant place to chill at on a lazy weekend for brunch. (: Love their Spaghetti Alio Olio! :D

Super hip! #singapore#cafe#hopping#wheelersyard#coffee
Desert wasn\'t that bad. I like the creativity. 
Conversation with the bikes ;)
Love the ambiance! Creative and interesting concept. Coffee has quite a strong body and aftertaste. Aglio Olio was average.
not bad for a one week old menu!

Chilling with my bro @pohsio over a cup of coffee and exploring new places
