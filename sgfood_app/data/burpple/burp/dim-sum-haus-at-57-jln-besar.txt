Deep fried to utter crispness is this mee sua kueh w bits of Chinese sausages that adds on an intense punch of savoriness! For $3.60, these blocks of mee sua kueh were a tad small than the ones I\'m used to having at another dimsum eatery down the road.
‚Ä¢\n<br />Forget your diet and sink your teeth into these beauties. Individually fried so it\'s crispy all round while still retaining its soft pillowy interior, it comes with bits of Chinese sausage and dried shrimp leading to an overall wonderful unmami experience üòç
‚Ä¢\n<br />Thankfully, its 100% the former as every dish they bring out invokes sweet memories of Hong Kong dim sum joints. I particularly enjoyed the charcoal chicken siew mai. It didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúporky‚Äù taste and I liked the texture that the little gobs of fish roe added. The Fu Pi Quan was also really well done. A thin layer of crisp beancurd skin enveloping fat shrimp, it wasn‚Äôt too oily which allowed us to pop them like candy. The har gao\'s skin was a bit too thick for my liking but the filling was generous and fresh.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Dim Sum Haus opens till 2am making it a perfect supper joint. In fact, it‚Äôll probably be my first choice for late night dim sum.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Thanks for @burpple and @dimsumhaus57jlnbesar for the invite and wonderful hospitality.
Some of the interesting dishes here (and some of my favourites of the day) would definitely be the baked salted egg custard bun, fried mee sua kueh and charcoal chicken&amp; shrimp siewmai. Also really liked the Hong Kong Boat Congee! 
Had the opportunity to return to Dim Sum Haus for a Burpple Tastemaker Eatup last night ‚Äî a place that I had been looking forward to make a return visit after my first visit some time back for I was impressed with the dim sum that they had to offer. The chefs prepare the dim sum fresh daily; a tedious job considering the wide spread of dim sum they have on the menu.
The first time I had something like this was from the dimsum shop nearby which my friends love - but honestly this left an impression on me more than the other did. Pan-fried, steamed, and deep fried again, I liked how it is evenly fried till crisp while the insides were still soft and springy, flavourful with dried shrimps and Chinese sausage.
I\'ve always loved boat congee (Ëâá‰ªîÁ≤•) for the amount of ingredients in it! Thought this was quite a good portion for its price, with squid, fish, peanuts etc. Not too heavy on flavour but comfortingly tasty and smooth.
Another remarkable item here; the baked char siew pastries were excellent. Not so much for the char siew filling but the exquisite pastry. The latter was close to melt in your mouth at some points; pleasantly crumbly at others and if you are detailed enough you\'d spot some pastry layering. It leaves me with praises of the ÁÇπÂøÉÂ∏àÂÇÖ behind these golden pastries. 
Baked bread bun of noteworthy thinness that could encapsulate almost an avalanche of salted egg custard. With a sweet and perfectly harden \"Bo Lou\" hat- these buns are in a league of their own; they\'d please many salted egg custard connoisseur.   
Vouching for their \"steamed/made to order\" value proposition; Dim Sum Haus is definitely a great place for..... Dim Sum and just Dim Sum- a variety of it (as seen above is only some from the entire menu). 
I loved this because instead of the usual pork, chicken was used! So yay no porky flavour and it was still juicy and shrimps fresh. Texture of the skin was nice and soft, while the roe gave a nice crunch. Will definitely get this again
This was an interesting spin on the usual chee cheong fan with steamed prawns inside! I enjoyed the crunch of fried exterior of the prawns in contrast to the smooth skin of the chee cheong fan.
Really enjoyed the dim sum offerings here that\'s freshly made on the spot! My most favourite dishes are the Baked Custard Buns (duh, haha) and the Mushroom Buns! üòç Prices are affordable too, so come in a group to order more and fill your tummies with these goodies! üòãüëç
I\'m more familiar with the Szechuan dumpling that has the shiok spicy red oil and that seductive sourish fragrant black vinegar. Essentially, these Japanese Dumplings at Dim Sum Haus tasted like fusion of three cuisines - shaped like gyoza with Chinese prawn dumpling (Ê∞¥È•∫) filling and skin then soaked in Szechuan dumpling\'s black vinegar and sprinkled with diced red chilli and coriander. For those who can\'t handle spiciness but enjoys vinegar, this is for you! üòÅ
Even though the skin was slightly thick for my liking, the bouncy and chewy consistency was on point. With plump prawns looming out of the translucent skin, there shall be no sharing for my next visit! üòÑ
Unlike the usual \"siew mai\" wrapped with yellow skin, the charcoal skin made the siew mai looked extra delicious with the contrasting colours. It does not have any different taste and texture from the normal yellow skin but there might be some teeny tiny health benefits since it\'s charcoal infused. 
Imagine the crispy Japanese ebi fry (fried prawn) in the soft silky rice roll with the sweet and savoury sauce poured over. This is actually one of the more tasty fusion items I\'ve ever tried at a dim sum place.
The congee at Dim Sum Haus is considerably light flavoured and smooth for its price range. Unlike many dim sum places which serve thinly shaved fish, Dim Sum Haus throws in a handful of sliced fish in thick cuts. üòâ
There ain\'t nothing like a hot bowl of congee to put some fire into your belly on a cold, clammy day, and Dim Sum Haus\' clam congee is one of the best at doing so.
I was heavily influenced by fellow Tastemaker Xing Wei\'s post, and I found myself getting a trio of these char siew sou(s). And good Lord if was sou sou good.
Wanted to grab these to go but ended up eating them on the spot because the aircon\'s pretty good and it\'s scorching hot outside üòÇ.
No service charge wor. And the #ÁÇπÂøÉ got standard one - the #liushabao #ÊµÅÊ≤ôÂåÖ here can ÊµÅ one üëçüëç. Not too ex also. Worth checking out. Promo at moment till 31 May - like and share their FB to get free calamansi. Parking is an issue though.
Ordered a bunch of items, and so far my favourites are the liu shar bao, xiao long bao and bbq pork bun! Not a  bad place, just hoped that the aircon wasnt blowing directly onto the food. Its quite cheap and affordable for the amount of dishes we ordered. The top of the liu shar bao is crispy and the custard does burst! The hong kong rice rolls is actually rice rolls with peanut butter. This place is a safe option to have affordable dim sum!
Another dish that stood out ‚Äî while the yam chunks are pretty solid in most iterations of this dish, the yam chunks come mushy here, creating this earth flavourful amidst the savoury gravy underneath that not only adds flavour to the pork, but also quite nice to have just by itself. Very delicious.
A twist to the usual rice roll (though getting a lot more common these days), the rice roll here is slippery smooth while encasing crisp, fried netted shrimp spring rolls within that comes with plump shrimp within ‚Äî a combination of textures of fried and steamed dishes all in one package. The accompanying soy sauce was pretty flavourful being rather savoury, though probably the presentation could be changed to help the rice rolls placed in the top to absorb the soy sauce better.
Sized smaller than the typical ones we get from other Dim Sum places, I liked how these weren\'t too filling and allows one to try more items in their menu. Another one of the items that are pretty well-executed, the buns were adequately thick and bouncy, while the insides were filled with reasonably sized chunks of char siew that is more savoury than sweet. Also another item I would recommend having here.
Came across Dim Sum Haus while scrolling past posts on Instagram and thought it would be worth a try since the dim sum looked pretty good.
Also another one of the dim sum that is executed better than the usual served at some dim sum restaurants ‚Äî the skin was adequately thin nor mushy or sticky, yet still springy while encased a fresh and plump shrimp comes encased within.

Clean and quiet environment. The salted egg bun is a must!!!! :)))) #burpple #sgfood #foodiesg #foodblogger #foodblogsg #foodislife #foodgram #foodie
Giving it an added crispy texture that goes well with the slippery &amp; smooth rice roll. ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />A dish that‚Äôs better to consume once it arrives at your table or else the soy sauce will cause the spring roll skin to go soggy. And I like mine firm, bouncy &amp; smooth which applies to every component  physically not just the rice roll. üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #DimSumHaus #DimSumHausSG #DimSum #ÁÇπÂøÉ #ÁÇπÂøÉÂ•Ω #crispy #shrimp #riceroll #cheecheongfun
The fragrance of the dried shrimps comes through nicely and the Chinese Sausage adds a nice touch. .\n<br />.\n<br />This is better than the one down the road which states their Deep Fried Mee Sua Kueh as a ‚ÄúSignature Dish‚Äù, personally I find it to be too greasy and lack of flavour. Maybe it‚Äôs time to pass the crown over. üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #DimSumHaus #DimSumHausSG #DimSum #ÁÇπÂøÉ #ÁÇπÂøÉÂ•Ω #È¶ôËÑÜËÖäÂë≥Èù¢Á∫øÁ≥ï #crispy #fried #meesua #kueh #meesuakueh #chinesesausage #panfried
