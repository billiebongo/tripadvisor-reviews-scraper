Meeting some friends for brunch. We had 9 people, so the Suprette folks graciously offered to set up a table outside in the hotel lobby. It looks amazing. Almost as if we booked the entire lobby. Well done Suprette folks! :)
Simply order a long black for an easy litmus test on the coffee or a place. This was disappointing. Watery and lack taste. Overpriced at $5!
Nice styling.
But still a good eat nonetheless.
Suprette burger and Eggs benedict! üç¥

// Hugely popular in Vietnam and not to mention in Sydney (I recall grabbing on to my loot hungrily while traversing the streets of syd on many occasions); the Suprette does its own rendition with liver p√¢t√©, pork, ham, pickled carrots, radish, coriander and basil. Super duper addictive chow especially with that crispy baguette intact - I just wish the coriander was fresher and more pungent for a herbaceous contrast. üòùRoot beer float, anyoneÔºü
food\'s quite good and portions are either big/filling! the eggs were poached in tomato sauce which is a unique twist. burger components included a buffalo style chicken patty and cheese
Ditching eggs again - Aglio Olio to start off for brunch.
Yummy..
A #yummy start to the new year!:)
Corn fritters. This eased an otherwise unpleasant morning.

A tad over fried

Pretty ok fare. Omelette was dry on the outside and creamy on the inside. Will stick with the suprette burgers the next time. Which are awesome!
