They truly never fail to delight with their unique and innovative flavours ☺️ Mooncake soft serve (S$6) atop a toffee nut waffle (S$15 in total) really served to brighten my gloomy mood on a rainy day 🌧 Loved the sweetness from the bananas and drizzle as well as the added crunch from the almonds 😙 Didn’t get to try the durian one but I guess that’s an excuse to go back again 🙇🏻‍♀️
But the one which I gave an exception was the Mooncake Softserve made from white lotus paste.\n<br />.\n<br />Imo lighter on the taste buds and felt less jerlat compared to a regular mooncake.\n<br />.\n<br />The other accompanying flavor was Durian Softserve which I can\'t help but shun, however @cassakating &amp; @thechoyalicious gave their thumbs up.
Badly missing this flavor they launched months back. Drizzled with rose scented white chocolate and seed shaped almonds, this made me forget about diet. 😂
Yet another round of softserves that has me craving for more. In line with Midautumn Festival (wooo my favourite time of the year!), Brother Bird\'s latest flavours are their D24 Durian and Mooncake. No I didn\'t say that wrong; it\'s a mooncake softserve. A light yet distinctive lotus base, that goes perfectly with their salted egg mochi donut bursts. Quite possibly the best deconstructed mooncake I\'ve had. My picture of that sucks so you\'re gonna have to settle for the D24 instead, which honestly is a fab option too. Not too sweet, with globs of durian flesh and it\'s characteristic bitterness cutting through the dessert.
This month\'s soft serve at @brotherbirdsg is the Durian (pictured) and Lotus Soft Serve. I\'m a fan of durian-anything and while the durian flavor wasn\'t that strong in the soft serve itself, be sure to pay attention to the D24 pulp that is laced around the rims with the coconut crunch.
Guess the highlight of this dish was none other than the mochi donut itself! Drizzled with warm chocolate sauce, the mochi was addictively chewy. &amp; your spoon simply go to and fro from the mochi to the Horlicks soft serve that was a little milky and flavored with Horlicks. Soft serve was able to hold it there for a good amount of time before it melts at an accelerating speed.
- Horlicks Milo Dinosaur Soft Serve (💵S$7) 🍦\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Faint hints of Horlicks linger throughout the Soft Serve with Chocolate Crumble &amp; Nuts on the rim. Apparently there\'s a molten lava full of Milo sauce hidden beneath, Beauty (or Deliciousness) is truly Skin (Soft Serve) Deep. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />This flavour Horlicks Milo Dinosaur &amp; the Sirap Limau (Bandung Rose flavour) are only available for this week. Rekindling with your Childhood taste that only can be found in Kopitiam Drink Stalls to this modern rendition is just toying with your feelings (a good way I mean) 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #sugarcakepie #brotherbirdsg #softserve #Milo #Horlicks #chocolate #nut #crumble #milodinosaur #icecream
I liked how unpretentiously local its taste is - one spoonful of it is enough to cue you to think of Bandung. Add a squeeze of the lime piece and prepare to colour your palette with its sharp tartness. This effectively cuts the sweetness which can get overbearing especially with rose-flavoured sweets.
A pretty satisfying dessert I\'d say. I recall the Horlicks taste being nicely understated, which is more appreciated than they\'ll ever know. It comes with Milo sauce extended over the donut - aptly done as the warmness of the sauce feels familiar and somewhat traditional to a warm cup of Milo.
Major sore throat that\'s been going on for a week, but that\'s not gonna stop me from coming for their August special flavours — Syrup Limau and Horlicks Dinosaur. The first\'s basically a rose syrup and lime juice kopitiam drink now soft serve-ified. Just in case the colour\'s not enough of a persuasion to order it, it\'s actually really yummy with the rose fragrance hitting you strong while still staying pleasant. I\'d say it\'s more akin to bandung than syrup limau, but hey no complaints there. Imma huge fan of malt though so not gonna deny that my favourite\'s the Horlicks Dinosaur. The familiar creaminess and maltiness of our childhood drink comes on strong enough to please hardcore fans like me, without being too intense and overpowering. And with that drizzle of milo sauce and crunch? C\'est parfait.

A monthly flavour along with syrup limau sorbet, this horlicks flaboured softserve comes with milo sauce and almond crumbles. The softserve was smooth, creamy but melted rather fast, hindering my prolonged enjoyment. Flavour of horlicks was distinct albeit subtle, with the milo sauce overshadowing it towards the end. Would personally prefer if the malty flavour is stronger though! Nevertheless, the combination with the crisp and crunchy almond crumbles was one that got me sold! Really really love the almond crumbles that I wouldn\'t mind buying them off shelves (if there are made available for retail purchase)! 💖 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
💓💓💓\n<br />// Good day good news so decided to treat myself some ice-cream hehe.. 💓\n<br />•\n<br />On a side note, it\'s been 3 years since i last visited @statelandcafe~ \n<br />#burpple
Coconut water sobert was v refreshing and it comes with a strong coconut taste to my liking😁
Salted Egg Mochi and Coconut Softserve ($15)
Very light and refreshing, isn\'t overpowering with its matcha taste or being too sweet. Most of the sweetness comes from the oozing warm salted egg sauce. Both of them goes hand in hand, very well done! 🤤\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $50!\n<br />Find out more:\n<br />http://peanutloti.com/deals-hollerout/\n<br />————————————————————————
Soft swirls with gula melaka, almond crunch and shredded coconut atop warm, chewy fried goodness.
Haven\'t been back since a disappointing Tokyo banana soft serve. Was in the area for exercise and decided to drop by because we exercise to eat more amirite?! No regrets and I didn\'t even feel guilty finishing this Coconut Water Sorbet soft serve ($7) by myself. The flavour of coconut was strong; texture was slightly icy, didn\'t mind cos it was so light and refreshing. No surprises about the combination of toppings but it was great nonetheless, absolutely loved the gula melaka which wasn\'t sweet, only wished there were more almond crunch with coconut shavings!😋
Thoroughly surprised that this photo turned out great since the softserve isn\'t that different from the background in terms of colour. But anyway, I had a go at the Thai Green Milk Tea Softserve ($7) the other day and loved it! 
Usually not a fan of coconut but this was surprisingly good! Texture was a little icy (though not as bad as the Thai green tea) but smooth and refreshing, a great perk-me-up for  the merciless scorching weather. Served with gula Melaka, almond crunch and specks of desiccated coconut flakes, the combination was much better here, with the almond crunch providing a pleasant crunch factor and the gula melaka contributing to a subtle tinge of sweetness. Really love the almond crunch toppings and if only the milk crumbs in the Thai green tea softserve could be replaced by this...\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
Texture was a tad too icy for my liking, though I do fancy the distinctive earthy note and lingering jasmine floral fragrance that was aromatic and refreshing! Vanilla sponge cake was soft, spongy, decent but I can\'t say the same so for the milk crumbs. Personally didn\'t fancy the addition of these milk crumbs that had a peculiar milk powder-alike flavour, somewhat like condensed milk that didn\'t really complement the Thai green tea softserve. Perhaps normal almond crumbles would have been a better replacement...\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
Housed under the same roof as Stateland Cafe in Bali Lane, Brother Bird demands repeat visits partly because their soft serve and mochi balls are delicious, but also because they change their flavours weekly — there\'s always something new to try! For the month of July, they have created soft serves inspired by traditional Asian beverages. Flavours currently on rotation are Hong Kong Milk Tea, Caffe Mocha and Yuan Yang. Get a Soft Serve cup ($7), which sees a generous serving of the ice cream layered with complementary toppings, or go all out with the addition of mochi balls, filled with flavoured lava like matcha and earl grey milk chocolate. The combination of chewy-soft rice balls and oozing liquid is definitely a treat! A dessert with mochi balls and a soft serve flavour of your choice will set you back between $14-$15, and is best shared with a friend.\n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim
For this week flavours, you can choose between Hk milk tea, Cafe  Mocha or Yuan Yang (a twist of the 2). Since I couldn\'t decide between milk tea or mocha, I decided to opt for yuan yang to enjoy the best of both worlds. Unfortunately there wasn\'t a significant colour contrast which I was expecting, with both flavours bearing a striking resemblance in colours- a pale brown hue. The swirl that I was served was a precarious \"leaning tower\" that collapsed after awhile 😂 - swipe to view the mishap. Nevertheless, the softserve was still enjoyable, with a smooth and melt-in-the mouth creamy texture. Both flavours complemented one another well, resulting in a milky flavour coupled with a lingering aroma of coffee and a mild earthy note. The mochi burst were fluffy and chewy, filled with thick, creamy earl grey chocolate lava burst that was luscious and chocolatey, with a mild lingering aroma of earl grey that could have been more distinct .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Roasted barley tea softserve with homemade maple granola and soy toffee sauce ($7)
Located at a 10min walk away from bugis mrt, brother bird has some amazing soft serve icecream in store for you☺️ Got the red velvet waffle with cookie butter icecream($15) and the soft serve icecream is really good. They also have other appetizing flavours and waffles to go along with it☺️\n<br />The waffle was a 7/10 as its a little too soft for my liking but the softserve was a 9/10😍 Its very cold which dosent melt easily, and the flavour is not too sweet which is just right for me👍🏻\n<br />Highly recommended to those who love soft serve icecreams and I would go back again soon💯
Unfortunately was only able to drag my arse out yesterday, leaving just one day to share this with y\'all 😪 Which also means it\'s that good, it warrants a share even if it\'s over in a couple of hours. Taro Milk Tea &amp; Earl Grey Milk Tea: Brother Bird\'s Gong Cha-inspired flavours are, trust me, worth the visit. Fans of earl grey would appreciate the intense fragrance in this soft serve, tea leaves clearly visible and floral notes mighty obvious — especially cute how it comes with bits of mango pudding! Though if I may add my personal fave\'s the Taro Milk Tea, creamy and smooth, and topped with earthy, savoury strips of taro chips 😋
Can\'t say enough good things about the mochi donut! Loved that it came warm &amp; was both crispy &amp; chewy at the same time. Taro Softserve was really smooth and not overly rich too! Would have this again anytime!
This week was originally supposed to solely feature Taro Milk, but it seems that they\'ve decided to do a tribute to Gong Cha which, as we know, is never dead as it lives on in our hearts. ❤️
late to the party but this was mind blowing!!! you wouldn\'t be able to get this anymore but it really shows how good their soft serve creations can be. the fragrance and flavour of the earl grey reminded me so much of my favourite gong cha drink and the mango pudding surprise within just did it for me. 
A refreshing cross between a sorbet and slushy, last week’s FOTW sees the return of Brother Bird’s Watermelon Softserve and luckily for me I got my hands on it before the next rotation. Embellished with almond dacquoise, melon seeds, dehydrated strawberry crisps, finished with a drizzle of rose scented white chocolate; the swirls do lean toward the sweet side and even more so with the lightly floral sauce as well as bits of meringue. The nice contrasting textures from the toppings do however add an element of fun with each spoonful. Ideal for the hot hot afternoon. And serving us well, this week will introduce the new Taro Milk Tea which I am really excited to try.
I really thought their Watermelon Softserve was an icy, refreshing treat that is extremely apt for the hotter times of the polarising weather this country has been experiencing lately. It captured the watermelon flavour really accurately too, and sees a new addition to their previous recipe; a contrasting element to it in the form of tartness from the chopped strawberries.
$14.00\n<br />Brother Bird never fails to disappoint. A crispy exterior with a classic mochi interior, the mochi doughnut stole my heart away. Topped with a thick and creamy softserve and served with almonds and crispy biscuits, the signature mochi is one of the must-try dishes at Brother Bird. 
JIZZ.
.
The salted egg flavour didn\'t really pair well with the interesting cookie butter softserve which tastes exactly as it\'s name - cookie dough + butter. With dried strawberries that give a sour punch and crispy yummy granola, there are many different flavours all at once. Overall, an enjoyable unique dessert but not sure if it\'s worth the price\n<br />📍@brotherbirdsg, 32 Bali Lane, S189868 (near Bugis mrt)
$15.00\n<br />One of my wishlisted dessert places ✔️\n<br />Being an avid fan of salted egg yolk, I absolutely loved how the salted egg sauce flowed out from the mochi. I expected the mochi to be just soft and mushy, but the outside of the mochi is surprisingly quite crispy! I chose the cookie butter softserve and I have to say, they were definitely generous with their serving. The softserve was thick and creamy, though I felt that the softserve could use a tiny bit more flavor. \n<br />Overall, the dish was well-balanced, making it unsweet, which I absolutely loved. Highly recommended to dessert lovers out there! 
Toyko Banana flavoured soft serve, topped with candied walnuts and spongy Toyko Banana cubes. I\'m impressed by how true this soft serve was to the actual flavour. Only wished there were more flavour elements to it, and that it didn\'t melt as fast. Definitely worth a try if you haven\'t already! 🍌
Tokyo Banana ($7)
This time is my favourite Japan snack - Tokyo Banana softserve! \n<br />Tasted more like Korean Banana Milk made into softserve, I kinda like it cause I like 🍌, but a little too sweet for my liking. Comes with butter cake for the Tokyo Banana cake element. \n<br />Had mine with matched with their Mochi Doughnut ($14 Nett) - more like Ham Chim Peng which I didn\'t fancy.
I\'ve never known Bird (that\'s what we call the owner btw) to be any less than adventurous, risk-taking, and the ultimate dreamer, and I think his latest soft serve creations clearly reflect this spirit. This Tokyo Banana soft serve was, for one, absolutely delightful. Banana soft serve\'s light, not overly creamy, with just enough 🍌-ness to please both nana enthusiasts and the average person. Love the itsy bitsy cubes of sweet cake, candied (I think that\'s what they are anyway) walnuts, and crushed pistachios, and while I\'d have liked the soft serve to be a tad creamier, this lighter take pairs well with their fab mochi donut. Bird may not be pushing boundaries as monumentally as Janice Wong, but his rustic, approachable desserts are no less stunning.

BrotherBird is now serving Banana Softserve with Salted Egg Bursts — the hot and cold combi with the chewy lava mochi balls is a perfect pairing. It\'s quite filling but I always seem to have space for them!
Spicy Korean Chicken Waffle with kimchi slaw, spicy yangnyum sauce and mustard. I thought the sauce can be spicier in a smaller amount to retain some of the crispy texture of the fried chicken. Worth mentioning is the tender thigh meat that was definitely on point!
Was pretty excited to try the new Tokyo Banana softserve that was introduced after the move of Brother Bird to under one roof with Stateland Cafe. We had ours with the Mochi Donut but you can also opt for the Salted Egg Mochi Bursts. The softserve tastes similar to the super popular Binggrae Banana Milk from Korea, but with an additional artificial sweetness which wasn’t really my thing. The variety of textures in this bowl was fun with the toppings of candied walnuts, banana crisps and squares of vanilla sponge cake, but I still prefer their Cookie Butter softserve for the overall flavour!
The cafe was initially a bit hard to find (it\'s co-located with Stateland). Service is pretty brusque, personally. We got the Salted Egg Mocha Bursts ($15). There is a choice of two flavours this month, cookie butter and Tokyo banana, we went with cookie butter. I was pleasantly surprised how soft and creamy the soft serve was. I also really liked the lotus biscuit taste in the cookie butter which was not too overpowering. The salted egg mochi balls were average I think. The mochi balls are fun to eat and the salted egg custard flowing out when cut open is always very satisfying. But it was more custard than salted egg and I was kind of expecting a stronger salted egg flavour. Although I thought the flavours would clash, the sweetness of the salted egg custard made it work. Really enjoyed this dessert anyway and definitely will come back to try more!
Ever since I had it in December I\'ve been dreaming of this in my sleep and I finally had a chance to go back for it!\n<br />-\n<br />It\'s creamy yet refreshing. Sweet yet muted. I\'m kinda sad they don\'t give the candied wintermelon pieces any more though. At $6 a pop it\'s definitely a must try!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #brotherbird #burpple #handsinframe
In any case, I\'m already feeling super excited just by looking at this spiral beauty!\n<br />•\n<br />Frankly speaking, I\'m not a huge fan of winter melon to begin with, but those who love it would no doubt enjoy the refreshing soft serve! (I still prefer the cookie butter flavour.) As for the mochi doughnut, I\'d be lying if I said I didn\'t like it.\n<br />•\n<br />P.S.: Had to make up the name for this dessert since food coma-stricken me couldn\'t recall both the name and price. 😂
Back again to try the avocado soft serve w mochi base ($14) looooove the subtle avocado flavour in the creamy soft serve and the warm, sweet, chewy mochi bun. Not the most balanced combo but defo good for your soul! (Or tummy)
Brother Bird recently unveiled two new seasonal flavours in regard to their softserve – Avocado and Wintermelon Tea. 
$15 with 3 mochi - lemon custard, cookie butter, salted egg. winter melon was kinda good! refreshing soft serve!!! wonder if they have flavors like chocolate??? cos i was looking forward to those... but they only have avocado and winter melon.
can\'t remember the name for this hah. the meat was pretty good but the rice was cold :( wonder if it\'s meant to be like this because it\'s my first time eating it.
The mochi balls were 😍 but overall I still find this too expensive. Worth a try but probably not worth returning.
The avocado has an acquired taste with a slight bitterness, rather interesting and pleasing for me. Where else, the wintermelon soft serve makes a refreshing treat. If you can\'t decide between them, go with the latter. 🍦#BrotherBirdSG
Nearly forgot about this little stop we made yesterday while we were at Bali Lane.\n<br />But the new soft serve flavour definitely isn\'t forgettable! Avocado with Gula Melaka! Reminds me of drinking a good avocado milkshake! Will definitely be back for this soft serve and out of the oozy mochi balls, the salted egg yolk one is still my favourite flavour.\n<br />#BrotherBirdSG #SoftServe #Avocado
-\n<br />This was everything I wanted from a fusion dessert! It\'s creamy yet refreshing at the same time. With bits of candied wintermelon were the cherry on top of my fantastic sundae!\n<br />-\n<br />Love love love love love ❤️!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #brotherbird #burpple
End work and will love to have some Avocado Soft Serve ($7) now. Using a higher ratio of avocado in the soft serve mix, each bite you\'ll be delighted with the rich creamy avocado. Top with salted corn flakes, desiccated coconut, and of course Gula Melaka!
Watermelon Soft Serve ($6.90)
Mochi donut with soft serve and topped with almond crunch. Soft serve is fragrant and the mochi donut is just nice (not too hard to chew). Overall it is a good combination!
Happy time🙆\n<br />Working 4 days instead of 5 does make a difference, time seems to pass by faster haha.
Salted egg yolk lava mochi donuts pair with cookie butter soft serve; sweet and savoury all at one time, prepare to confuse your taste buds!
Nothing beats the heat of summer more than a slice of cold watermelon, and now you can have the same cooling down effect without the messy explosion of juices and disposing the skin with this watermelon soft serve. The sorbet stays up for quite a long time, allowing you to enjoy the melting sweetness in your mouth. \n<br />:\n<br />The name derives from the accompanying fried mochis surrounding the swirl, and as you may have guessed they encased molten raspberry coulis - not quite possible to pop them in your mouth given the size, so do cut them open gingerly to release the filling. I thought these were too sweet, so I\'ll probably get just the watermelon sorbet solo on my next visit.
\"The Signature\" (💵S$14) from Brother Bird. I know it looks like Shit but bare with me, this is some Good Shit (Pun/Phrasing...Hahaha) served with Homemade Cookie Butter Soft-Serve on a Mochi Donut topped with Almond Crunch 🍩\n<br />.\n<br />The Homemade Cookie Butter Soft-Serve has a Pleasant Cookie Butter Aroma without being overly Sweet with a texture that can be Smoother. 🍦\n<br />Crunchy on the outside &amp; Chewy inside, I really Like the Consistency &amp; the Combination of the Mochi Donut which I think is kinda Genius. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Brother Bird shares the same space as Stateland Café. Other than \"The Signature\" try their Various Soft-Serve with Liu Sha filled Donut Balls, Matcha filled Mochi Balls, Raspberry filled Mochi Balls &amp; Earl Grey filled Mochi Balls (💵S$15) 🖖🏻
This was everything I love in a dessert!! A warm chewy ball of mochi with a crisp, caramelised exterior juxtaposed against a (huge) swirl of creamy, cookie butter soft serve ice-cream. So good! The texture of the mochi was 😍! I also love the crunchy almonds (and brittle?) which were super fragrant. The portion was a little too big for me though so I\'d recommend sharing it with a pal.
The cookie butter soft serve wasn\'t that sweet as I\'ve imagined and was served with warm and chewy earl grey Mochi balls that spurted chocolaty goodness. 😛😛\n<br />📍30 Bali Lane\n<br />---------------------------------------------\n<br />[PROMOCODE] quote dashofparadox for 10% off your bill on your @holler.out app with min spending of $55. 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
Today shall be a good day…\n<br />#BrotherBirdSG #StatelandCafe *
Very refreshing taste but I don\'t really fancy on this .
I like the salted egg yolk Mochi donuts 😍they have few flavor of Mochi donut here like matcha /earl grey /raspberry ,but One thing I don\'t like is you can only order their Mochi donut together with softserve ice cream which cost $15.00 per set ,their softserve just like normal ,nothing special ,but their liu sha Mochi donut is nice ,it will be  good if you could come with big group so that u can order and try difference flavor of donut 😍
Just when you thought it couldn\'t get more interesting than mochi donuts, then came mochi balls with insanely addictive liquid centers, an adventurous pumpkin soft serve — and now a new watermelon one. Made with whole watermelons, Brother Bird\'s new soft serve flavour is refreshing, clean-tasting, and definitely a breath of fresh air. You can literally taste the subtle acidity of the rinds in there — how much more authentic can it get? This 🍉🍦 will be launched today, so grab one if you\'re around the area!
Brother Bird is launching a new soft serve flavor tomorrow — Watermelon! 🍉🍉🍉
Yes, that\'s what afternoons are for. A great escape from the heat outside.
Move aside, Pumpkin &amp; Welcome Watermelon!! This coming Wednesday @brotherbirdsg will be launching new soft serve flavour, Watermelon. This refreshing flavour is dairy-free so it\'s icy unlike their other flavours. Have it in a cup ($7) or together with their oozing Raspberry Mochi Bursts ($15), it\'s your choice~
Cool refreshing watermelon soft serve for this weather. Slightly sweet, slightly sour and comes serves with frozen strawberries. Must order here, alongside with liu sha mochi 😍
The risotto here made me a really happy girl for the day - I admit it isn\'t the usual al dente risotto rice kind (if you are expecting those, then sorry) but the one here is made much softer (almost like a mashed potato texture) which made it much more comforting to have on a chilly day. Paired with tender chicken, fried shallots and bok choy! \n<br />We couldn\'t resist but order the truffle fries ($11) as well - chunkier thicker fries were used, super satisfying!! Thank you for feeding us @brotherbirdsg &amp; @cassakating for extending the invite!
1/3 of today\'s Cafe hopping\n<br />It took us sooo long to find this place, which is located within Stateland cafe, nothing to show its presence but a black cloth banner with their brother bird logo. When the Ice cream arrived (points for it being fast!😁), it was already slightly melted :( But the taste was great! The cookie butter soft serve was really creamy and smooth and toppings were found not just on top of the soft serve☺ For $6 though...hmmm, maybe just for a try!☺
One of the best soft serve I\'ve tried and probably the only place (i think) that has the soft serve taste of the biscuit called, Biscoff! Not too sweet but sweet enough 👍🏻 $6 for a very generous with their soft serve portion and their Almond crunch!! 
One of my favourite places lately cos of the cosy vibe and of course fairy lights… and mochi doughnuts. Nice place to chill and get some work done too.\n<br />“Few delights can equal the presence of one whom we trust utterly.” —George MacDonald\n<br />#BrotherBirdSG #WorkHardAnywhere
Finally having a taste of Brother Bird’s mochi donut balls with @cweizhi, all thanks to @Burpple! 
Bursting rose scented raspberry donut-mochi balls with cookie butter softserve. Who would have thought of such a combination? I enjoyed the variation of texture on this plate from the addition of the unsung heroes - dehydrated raspberry bits and pie crumbs. The oozing donut balls were soft and slightly chewy with a generous amount of that sweet smelling filling. The buttery softserve melts really fast though so quickly get your picture and enjoy! We took a little too long and ended up with a mini cookie butter pool which I scooped up with a fork ops. Hahaha pass me a spoon please! The Pumpkin Pie Softserve is no longer for sale at Brother Bird as they are prepping to launch a whole new flavour. Can\'t wait to see what\'s up Bird\'s sleeves! 
Raspberry rose mochi donuts with cookie dough soft serve was super crazy my teeth hurt kinda sweet. Gonna stick with the salted egg ones in future but mochi donuts alwayzzzzz. 
Salted egg mochi donut with cookie butter soft serve and smores waffles with chocolate gelato. Sweetness overload in the Liu sha and icy ice cream and soft serve. But hunger and company take priority in this case.
Initially wanted the spiced pumpkin soft serve but I think we didn\'t manage to order properly and got cookie butter soft serve with matcha and liu sha bursts ($15 each) instead! The soft serve was creamy and not too sweet, but melted really quickly, while the donut balls were delightfully oozy (esp the matcha ones). I just wish they would\'ve given us spoons to eat with....
This one has Liu shar and the ice cream is great. 
What else more I ask for?\n<br />Have a good Sunday evening everyone.
Photogenic and yummy. Why not give it a try when there is matcha mochi! Anything matcha is good. The rice mochi that was serve were abit too sticky however the matcha sauce from the mochi saved it and everything just turn out good :) Just that the cookie soft serve melts a little too fast, however the taste of it is addictive and nice. Price is a little too high, will be better if price is more friendly for students like us.
This is Mochi Donut BALLS! Glutinous rice is used in their mochi donut balls for its distinctive, soft chewy texture and are freshly prepared, which are fried and gorgeously puffed, spurting the oozing salted egg filling in your mouth! The contrast between the warm donut and cold soft serve is such a treat, topped with almond crunch and dehydrated raspberry that added a crunchy texture to it too. A great way to stay cool under this scorching hot weather!
It consists of 3 matcha lava donuts and a pumpkin soft serve. Didn\'t quite fancy the pumpkin flavour. Also find it rather pricey imo for ice cream and 3 mini balz. 🍦😳
Promo code applicable to most cafes in the App too (just ask me!) 😊\n<br />Anyway guys, I\'m totally having the best time of my life right now. To exaggerate a little, I\'ve literally been locked out of humanity &amp; the world for the past week like a psychological jail sentence (was home alone too) &amp; ... I\'ve never felt so alive since ytd! Now it\'s like an infinite amount of incredible awesomeness all over the place 😂 Lots of adventures today as well &amp; I can\'t wait for my internship to start next week! 🙌🏻\n<br />Sincerely hope that everyone else\'s having a great time too! Stay happy &amp; cheers to a delicious life! 🍾
I poked the donut and it keep bleeding. Keep keep bleeding. Bleeding red ooze all over my ice cream. \n<br />So I ate all the donuts so that it won\'t bleed any more. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Congrats on coming so far. Congrats on your graduation, dear. Love you. 😘 @dianaaatan
We got to sample their 2 new items such as \n<br />_\n<br />Matcha Bursts - Matcha and white chocolate filled mochi balls with pumpkin soft serve
Had both with cookie butter ice cream - wasn\'t that great because it was quite icy when we had it 😐 donuts were too sticky and they weren\'t very molten either
Been a fan of their sinful mochi donut balls since I first visited - which honestly is pretty recent - and their newest two flavours are just bangin\' it. Loved the Matcha balls that are intensely fragrant, really giving you that authentic bitter tea aftertaste. Fans of fruitty desserts would like the Rose &amp; Raspberry ones!
The matcha inside the mochi balls literally exploded out once you peel them open and the pairing with the chewy mochi balls is such an impeccable partnership. This totally just hit a home run. If you are not a matcha fan, do also check out their other new combination of Cookie Butter Soft Serve with Raspberry Chocolate Mochi Balls ($15). This was a tasting hosted by @brotherbirdsg and many thanks to @cassakating for the invite.
Explosively flow-y thick sauce, with hints of lovely bitter matcha undertones. \n<br />The pumpkin flavor though understated, served its purpose well. A solid foundation, for the matcha to shine. \n<br />Monster loves his donuts.
It\'s crazy how it\'s raining out there yet it\'s still so HOT AND HUMID. I\'m in dire need of a chiller in the form of this pumpkin soft serve and those bursting good balls.
ohmygod this was so heavenly I can\'t even 🙄🙄🙄 did not expect the chewiness to the mochi balls and certainly did not think the chocolate oozing out would be worth any hype but not was I wrong. the flavors pretty normal but it turned out to be a frickin heavenly combination jeeeez still think the soft serve is a tad too sweet but yknow what I\'d come back for the poopballs anyday man

Newly launched item here is the \n<br />Pumpkin Softserve with Matcha Mochi Balls ($15) ! Soft chewy handmade mochi balls with an instgrammable burst of hot molten matcha filling ! Wasn\'t over the top sweet which compliments the Softserve .\n<br />The pumpkin softserve wasn\'t over the top strong to make it off putting. (Y) \n<br />Would really love to see a mixed mochi version tho.
6$ for this cup of ice-cream. The ice cream melted faster than I expected 😅.The portion can be served up to 2 person for a cup. There are another choices which come in plate form(15$). Oh ya! Apparently, The location is within the Stateland cafe(combined).
Featured here are 2 newly-launched items: Pumpkin Soft Serve with Matcha Mochi Balls &amp; Cookie Butter Soft Serve with Raspberry Rose Mochi Balls.
We all loved the smoky flavour and al-dente spaghetti of the Mentaiko Aglio Olio ($19) and the melt-in-the-mouth Salmon ($22). Brother Bird serves up the same dinner menu as its sister branch, @statelandcafe, which makes it a great place for dinner AND desserts!
Choose between Japanese Pumpkin soft-serve with Matcha Mochi balls ($15) or Cookie Butter soft-serve with Raspberry Mochi balls ($15). Love the Matcha that has a sharp bite followed by lingering sweetness. Complimenting the chewy donut balls are bits of brown sugar pie crumbs and toasted pumpkin seed. It\'s just plain good!
The contrast between the warm donut balls and cold soft serve is such a treat under this scorching weather!
New on Brother Birds\'s menu are these Matcha Mochi Balls with Pumpkin Pie Soft Serve and Raspberry Rose Mochi Balls with Speculoos Soft Serve launching today! \n<br />I\'m all crazy over anything matcha and these oozy matcha mochi balls are to die for!! Soft chewy texture with a perfect molten lava matcha filling that is bold &amp; bittersweet — exactly how I like my matcha to be. If you\'re not a fan of pumpkin, the ice cream was very creamy enough hence acceptable. I\'d choose the speculoos one any day though!
Brother Bird has outdone itself again, this time with amazeballs Matcha mochi donuts. With intensely rich filling inside, the Matcha lovers around the table were all nodding their head in approval. Matcha mochi balls come served with pumpkin soft serve but we suspect speculoos soft serve might work better. \n<br />Thanks @cassakating for the invite 🙆🏻
Brother Bird has been added to my list of favourite cafes now. They don\'t have free WiFi, but the space is cosy, perfect for creatives. My favourite part of the cafe are the fairy lights—maybe it\'s just me cos I seem to have developed a fascination for the decorative lights. 😍 Sometimes the most simple of things brings about the most happiness.#WorkHardAnywhere #BrotherBirdSG

Salted egg yolk basking in the last light for the day. First time trying Brother Bird and enjoyed these salted egg donuts the most. With cookie butter soft serve topped with cornflake crunch and freeze dried strawberry for added flavour and texture. Looks like we\'ll be back for more soon.\n<br />Thanks @karlnch for the invite and @brotherbirdsg for hosting us.\n<br />#BrotherBirdSG *
nah, it rains sometimes 😂\n<br />-\n<br />So, last sunday I had fun cafe-hopping with the humble couple behind @feast.it . Taken on our first stop, @brotherbirdsg [@statelandcafe]. Beautiful, aren\'t they? Pleasing to the eye, and tastebuds. Too bad they\'re no longer serving taro ice cream [it\'s awesome] but yeah.. butter popcorn was pretty cool. Could be a bit bland eaten on it\'s own, but i guess that\'s what the cornflakes and popcorns are for. 😁 Can\'t wait to try their upcoming new donuts tho..!\n<br />-\n<br />🍦 Cookie Butter soft-serve [front] // Butter Popcorn soft-serve [back]\n<br />💰 S$6.00 each\n<br />🏠 @brotherbirdsg\n<br />📍 @statelandcafe / 32 Bali Lane, Singapore
It was really fun introducing this bunch of friendly, food-mad folks to my pick of 5 places around the Kampong Glam neighbourhood. As you can imagine, it was incredibly hard to whittle away the many places to form this short list but it finally came down to @artistrycafesg #warongnasipariaman @thehangarsg @brotherbirdsg and @fluffbakery
Stuffed our faces silly with their latest flavours (which names I\'m having trouble remembering at the moment because we had to eat them fast since they were melting by the second!) Dessert-lovers beware: their 流沙 and Raspberry soft-serve will keep you coming back for more! #Burpple #BurppleSG #TastyTastemakerTour
\'What on earth? What are those green balls?\' If you\'ve been to Brother Bird before, you may be asking yourself this question as you scratch your head and wonder if you\'ve missed this item on the menu.
I\'m almost ashamed to admit it, but I failed to get a solo closeup pic with my favorite, unreleased set of balls during the Tasty Tastemaker Tour stop at Brother Bird. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to Exhibit A, which is the plate of 3 red balls at the bottom right hand corner.
Famed for their liu sa donut balls previously, Brother Bird has up the ante by releasing 3 more variations of earl grey, matcha and raspberry white chocolate. My favourite has definitely got to be the matcha as there was a hint of the matcha bitterness when you bite into it and how can anyone say no to the flowing liquid matcha when you pry open the donuts. Plus, the chewy texture eaten together with the softserve makes it an irresistible combination.
Liusha Donut Balls with Cookie Butter Softserve, Earl Grey Donut Balls with Butter Popcorn Softserve, Matcha and Raspberry White Chocolate Donut Balls with Softserve.
At the 4th stop on warm afternoon out on the #tastytastemakertour , this is a much needed respite. Soft serve comes in buttermilk and butter popcorn. I personally prefer the slightly savoury butter popcorn. Matcha donut balls were oozing with a generous dose of warm matcha filling. \'Note to self: raspberry donut balls were kickass！👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\' #burpple #brotherbirdsg 
Hmmm I think the hype for this is a bit too much cause tbh I don\'t fancy the donuts as much as I thought I will be. Hahaha but the Liu sha is really nice, just that the texture of the donuts are a bit too chewy 😂 But I will still go back to try the other flavour! HAHAHAHA 
Earl Grey Donuts with Butter Popcorn Softserve [$15] • \n<br />Was a little skeptical on my second visit, but was pleasantly surprised with this dish and completely changed my perception of the unflavourful mochi donuts. \n<br />The Earl Grey taste was still identifiable though I would have preferred it to be stronger. The chocolate in the Earl Grey donut solved my issue of \'bland\' mochi donuts. Paired with a lighter softserve, making the dish less \'gelak\'. Pleasant experience this time round.\n<br />Anyway!! 💡Get 10% off when you spend more than $55 at Stateland Cafe/ Brother Bird by downloading the @holler.out app and entering the code \"cake.cass\" ENJOY!
I loved everything about this! Cookie soft serve was smooth and mild-flavoured, bits of corn flakes added a nice crunch, and that caramel kicked it up to just the right amount of sweet. Best thing though has to be those liu sha mochi donuts: crisp, warm, sticky, chewy, and encasing the most fantabulous liu sha filling (the best I\'ve tasted amidst this salted egg hype). As per all soft serves, the flavour\'s much subtler on the palate, so don\'t be faulting them for no in-your-face speculoos taste.
.\n<br />💩💩💩\n<br />.\n<br />I think the buttermilk softserve is good enough on its own, and where\'s the earl grey again?
It was an exquisite yum in my tum but also a ridiculous hol in my poc. The softserve + liu sha donut was amazeballs. I didn\'t understand my boyfriend\'s constant desire for it (like tio gong tao wtf) until i tried it. 
Liu Sha Donut Balls w Cookie Butter Softserve ($15) is way toooo legit! One of the best feeling in life is to cut open these liu sha balls and see it oozing out of em.😋 Definitely coming back for the other earl grey flavour! 👍🏻👍🏻\n<br />————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill when you spend $55\n<br />————————————————————
🙌 -- 1st weekend in march, yo! #igotswag 😂\n<br />-\n<br />Here\'s a throwback to start the weekend [cause we are still figuring where to go today 😅], Liusha donuts sprinkled with salted cornflakes and dried strawberries, had it served with Cookie Butter soft-serve. Honestly? I prefer their taro. 😁 [full coverage on the blog, hit the link ☝]\n<br />-\n<br />🍴 Liusha Bowl\n<br />🍦 Cookie Butter\n<br />💰 S$14.00\n<br />🏠 Brother Bird @brotherbirdbali [currently nesting with stateland cafe]\n<br />📍 30 Bali Lane, Singapore
Tried their classic signature rice donut with cookie butter soft serve ($14) but found it slightly pricy - especially the rice donut which was $9 and not particularly yummy in my opinion. The cookie butter ice cream was a nice &amp; unique flavour tho, but really wished there were more to choose from (there\'s only 2 flavours monthly)
Butter Popcorn Soft-serve ($6) or choose to have it together with some Earl Grey Donut Balls ($15). Interesting combination to have earl grey donut balls with chocolate lava but it will be perfect if the earl grey taste was stronger. Plus the popcorn toppings has lost its crispness 😢
eating this Matcha Classic ($6) is definitely one of the best ways to beat the heat. consisting of honeyed cornflakes, rice balls, and azuki beans, when eaten together with the soft serve, it makes you want to eat some more because it\'s so good 😍 the combination of the soft serve and toppings went well; the honeyed cornflakes toned down the slight bitterness of matcha. i like the simple presentation as well! 
Average and tbh was quite disappointed. Had high expectations for it after all the reviews. The softserve melted too fast, leaving us with a bowl of  \'soup\' at the end and the mochi donut was nothing special
This LIUSHA ($14) from brother bird is quite creative I would say.. the taro/buttermilk swirl softserve was smooth, and the salted egg yolk donut balls were chewy.. have to eat it fast as the softserve melts quickly..
I\'m excited but scared at the same time. 😔 A close friend made this postcard \"Take Heart, Do Not Be Afraid\" (the calligraphy\'s awesome😍 thank you so much @claraleees ) and I\'m so glad that these words were in handy at this point of time. Here\'s to an awesome Tuesday and I really wish it would be a happy one! 😂✈️
The mochi donut.... I KENUT give me 10 more 👻 soft serves here are always good but the warm gooey/cold contrast between the donut and icecream is what makes it the bombdiggity~
We all know taro and milk make a great couple.. so that up there is bound to be good. Know what? It didn\'t dissapoint! Although, it\'s not exactly budget friendly. \n<br />-\n<br />And ih! I made a post about my visit. Care to check it? Simply type bit.do/BrotherBird on your browser NOW! 😊\n<br />-\n<br />🍴 Choco Bowl\n<br />💰 S$13\n<br />📍 32 Bali Lane [still sharing the same nest with stateland] 😊\n<br />🚅 Bugis
There\'s no such thing as too much dessert… unless your tummy is showing.
I admit i thought this place was faddy when i first went late Dec 2015 - the taro soft serve tasted artificial and the tapioca pearls were severely undercooked. We\'ve been back two other times since (out of convenience) and it\'s only gotten better. The mochi texture of the rice donut is something special and the almond crunch is the perfect accent to the pillowy soft serve. New items pls? Looking forward to more creations
Finally visited this place, but sadly alone, so I couldn\'t try the mochi donuts due to space constraint (of my tummy). They ran out of the black pearls so I asked them to replace it with almond crunch. Good combination for me, strong coconut flavour with macadamia and almond blends in harmony with the rather underwhelming taro. And it\'s not too sweet, just the way I like it.\n<br />*\n<br />Psst, currently they are located at the 2nd level of Stateland cafe!
Wanted to try their Liu Sha donuts though they were not available at point of ordering. The Mochi &amp; soft serve combi did not work as well as we expected &amp; it\'d have been better if their Mochi donuts were flavoured. But the soft serve itself was a redeeming factor on its own 😋\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 3.5/5\n<br />Worth your calories? Yes to the soft serve but not that much to the mochi, try the Liu Sha ones if you have the chance!\n<br />📷 Credits: @cake.cass
2 weeks later and this is a lot better. Maybe towards the end of the day the consistency gets frostier. Kinda mild tasting, and love the feuilletine/cereal textural element.
In love with the mochi donut here!! The crisp cereal and raspberries were a nice touch as well! Only the cookie butter/taro flavours were available when I went, not really the best soft serve I\'ve had but would have loved to try the matcha.
The softserve had melted too easily as the warmth from the rice donut below sped up the melting process, though the mixture of both softserve flavours were great. The rice donut was rather hard to cut into, but the combination of it with the softserve was good nonetheless.
Utterly disappointed - soft serve here was icy and not as soft as its name (or appearance) suggests. The tapioca pearls were also still hard and chunky on the inside (undercooked!). What a letdown.
Yam-mylicious soft serve. Mmhmm mmhmm taro milk tea flavoured soft serve ice cream and the classic cookie butter soft serve. A small and cosy little shop at Bali Lane. Not many seats there but you can definitely get a cup on the go. (Go shopping 😉)
Here\'s Cookie Butter  soft serve with almond crunch and sea salt from Brother Bird. Have a great weekend everyone! \n<br />Nice meeting you today @methelmeth!
Rather aesthetically pleasing. Wanted to try the Liu Sha one but it was not available at time of ordering. It would have been better if the Mochi donut was flavoured (friend\'s feedback) &amp; all of us agreed that the Mochi &amp; soft serve combi did not work as well as we expected. At least, the soft serve was the redeeming factor. 😋
Price at $13                                                                                                          Choice of soft serve🍦- Butter cookies / Taro.                                                                     The sweetness of the soft serve was just right ( It tasted like vanilla though ) which actually balance out the taste with the donut🍩.                             
Mochi donut with dual cookie butter &amp; taro softserve($12.90). The mild flavour softserve goes well with the sweet mochi. Very filling for 1 person to consume. Recommended to share with at least 1 person, especially when you are there after your dinner! 
New flavour up at Brother Bird: Taro! Served with the popular \'cookie crumbles\' and a scoop of bubble tea pearls, this taro soft serve reminds me very much of Taro milk tea. Lightly yam flavoured (as seen by the color of the soft serve), it was more creamy and milky than I\'d have liked. Up the yam flavour a bit more please? 
Mochi donuts gets extra points for oozing warm liusa. But the cookie butter soft serve was a little bland(diluted?). Will be back to try the other flavours though.
The best mochi donut I\'ve ever had! (actually, the ONLY mochi donut I\'ve ever had) 🙈\n<br />Piping hot glazed mochi donut, crispy on the outside, dense chewy insides, with a towering cookie butter soft serve, almond crumble and freeze dried berry crisps. Step aside, waffles and icecream!
Served warm, the crisp and slightly chewy mochi donut was jazzed up with salted caramel, a dusting of kinako, and almond brittle for an added crunch. As for the soft serve, the delectable speculoos-like Cookie Butter trumped  Matcha many times over, the latter being disappointingly weak in flavour.
The inner sugar-phile saw the beautiful duo swirl and kept screaming in my head, \"take the pictures before it melts!\"\n<br />Aside from being picture worthy, the soft serve itself was ok... smooth, malty, but doesn\'t have the sophisticated layered flavours like from Sunday Folks, and matcha was so-so (I very much prefer Tsujiri).\n<br />The liu-sha mochi donuts were quite like tang-yuan, fried with oozy golden custard and a pleasantly chewy glutinous skin.\n<br />Generally a decent dessert, but I\'m not sure it left an impression deep enough for me to want to return for more.
Matcha Classic\n<br />Honey cornflakes, rice ball and azuki beans 》$6
Ordered this Mont Blanc \"Bird Nest\" - deep fried rice donut topped with matcha soft serve, chestnut cream and meringue crumbs (mine was cornflakes though). Waited around 25 mins for this when I was the only customer in the shop, the staffs were busy chit-chatting &amp; laughing. I asked one of the staffs why is it taking so long, she explained and ROLLED her eyes. \n<br />When it was served, I cut the rice donut and found a layer of oil below it, GROSS! Chestnut cream was tasteless and matcha taste of the soft serve was rather subtle as well. Guys, save the money and go somewhere else that serve better desserts and definitely better service.
Feeling a little hmmmm today and Brother Bird is here to save the day!! 힘 !! 💪💪
Liu Shaaaaaaa Rice ball with Cookie Butter Softserve $14.90 👍🏻👍🏻 Super nice 😍
Mochi donut?? Definitely a first for me! Wasn\'t too sure what to expect of it, and was half worrying that it would be too starchy. The donut was served warm with a sweet glaze over it. Chewy mochi with a sweet donut skin - I actually enjoyed it!! Presentation was totally on point with that perfect swirl of cookie butter and matcha soft serve. Brother Bird knows the way right into our hearts as I\'m really into these 2 flavors right now! The soft serve was very good with its light flavors that was needed with the heavy tasting donut. Dust with some almond crunch, kinako powder and berries crisp, the Classic is something that you should stop by for! 
It was incredibly tasty! I couldn\'t decide on a favourite- both the cookie butter and the matcha were tasty! I like that there was abit of crunch from the cornflakes in btw the swirls.
How come I got a smudged brother bird :(. The speculoos taste is too faint in the soft serve that I can barely taste it and it melts a little too fast. Maybe I would come back just to try the mochi donut that everyone is talking abt. But their soft serve needs some improvement...
soft served was supposed to be matcha but tasted more like a very cheap kind of green tea.
Specializes in soft serve and rice donuts, we had the Mont Blanc \"Bird\'s Nest\" $14.90. Matcha swirl with chestnut cream, meringue crumbs and rice donut. Interesting combination and we all agree the rice donut was good. Deep fried on the outside while chewy mochi-like texture within, best eaten with soft serve. 🍦
Soft serve matcha ice cream with salted caramel, kinako powder, almond crunch and berry crisps. Heads up: the green tea flavor is pretty robust, so make sure you\'re a fan. Otherwise, we preferred the speculoos cookie butter soft serve with its subtle buttery creaminess.
As hard as I fell for the Mont Blanc \"Bird\'s Nest\" with Matcha softserve, this \"Liu Sa\" with Cookie Butter softserve had me falling even harder. Yes, those three salted egg yolk custard-filled spheres don\'t exactly \"liu\" (流), but they\'re still amazeballs!! (Pun totally intended 😁). I think I may have developed an addiction for Brother Bird\'s creations. 😆
[Mont Blanc \"Bird Nest\" S$14.90] - matcha ice cream with chestnut cream on rice donut, with meringue crumbs. Love the chewy rice donut, 超爱那QQ的圈饼!
[Brother Bird] This location has changed hands several times recently, firstly it was Stateland Cafe, then Honeycomb and now Brother Bird, but do you know that all of them are under the same company?
Absolutely loving this satisfying dessert! There\'s a choice between matcha and (speculoos) cookie butter soft serve. We reckon cookie butter pairs better with \"liu sha\"; matcha overpowers it. The soft serve, albeit a little icy, held a nice tinge of speculoos that complemented the fried rice balls perfectly. 
Forming the base was Brother Bird\'s iconic chewy mochi rice donut. Served warm after just being fried, it was squiggled with loads of chestnut cream and feathered with crunchy cornflakes that had an addictive buttery saltiness. A generous swirl of creamy matcha soft serve (made in-house) crowned this divine creation. I also like that it\'s big enough to share between two people. 
Matcha-and-speculoos soft-serve totally rocks my boat, and the mochi \'donuts\' are a stroke of genius, man. Give me this over Krispy Kreme anytime!\n<br />#burpple #avecmonsieurlagrimace #ignorethephallicshape
Like the rising PSI levels, this rice donut soft serve has increased by S$3.90 to S$12.90.
but what I loved more was that twirl of a butter cookie ice cream. complimenting flavours which went well with my childhood favorite sugar coated crushed cornflakes.
A classic photo featuring The Classic ($14.90). I chose the Cookie Butter soft serve, accompanied by the well-known fried mochi rice donut, with almonds &amp; banana crisps sprinkled around the plate. 
When I showed my mum a picture of the soft serve before coming here, the first thought that came to her was \"it looks like poop\". But somehow photogenic? This is the Green Tea Soft Serve ($6), complemented with Azuki beans, mochi balls, &amp; honey cornflakes.
Best of all, it is paired with my all-time favourite Liu Sa rice balls aka salted egg yolk custard sauce ($14.90). Flowing with enthusiasm from the crispy hot rice balls, the creamy liu sa was a joyful jumble with the matcha soft serve, accompanied by a savoury yet sweet-and-bitter matcha aftertaste! \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Green with envy, green with matcha! And we were grinning, not greening from ear to ear!
Dual swirl with liu sha rice rice donuts. (14.90)
.\n<br />|\n<br />Freshly fried rice donut with soft serve matcha ice cream. The donut was good - crispy on the outside and soft in the inside but the soft serve still need some improvement. The matcha taste stated strong but weak finish.
With Brother Bird\'s menu expansion, they have renamed the Mochi Rice Doughnut &amp; Soft-Serve combination as \"Classic\". Coming with the same kinako powder, almond crunch and dehydrated berries, we opted for the newest flavour in the house; Matcha to go along this time round. Matcha purists might find this slightly off the palette; it feels as though there is a Jasmine infusion with the Matcha flavour (a tad Pokka Green Tea-esque in flavour), and as a result feels a tad subtle. Still matches the Mochi Rice Doughnut well, especially since the doughnut is pretty heavy with flavour with the salted caramel drizzle.
Green with envy, green with matcha! And we were greening (I mean grinning) from ear to ear!
came here to try the honeydew sago but was not in the menu anymore, so tried the butter cookie instead. worth the try. taste great too 😍
Puffed up peak of smoothest Speculoos-flavoured soft serve that tasted a little caramelly and sea-salty. Thrown over it were bits of almond crunch while a piece of the much beloved Lotus biscuit became the Excalibur to be pulled out, crumbled up and tossed back in to be eaten with the fabulously creamy soft serve for maximum enjoyment.
Like a stylish designer hat, the voluptuously sexy dual swirl of coconut and cookie-butter soft serve sat on top of the warm, deliciously chewy fried mochi donut. Every element of the dessert was obviously designed to ensure this concoction would impress tastebuds. Like how even the add-on\'s of sticky salted caramel, almond crunch and dehydrated berries were above the ordinary. I must admit every bite of this heavenly combo made me positively coo with happiness. 
What makes these voluptuous looking milk-based beauties stand out was, firstly, how original they were. Secondly, each one of these tasted so wonderful in their own way. I think Sunday Folk has finally met some serious competition!\n<br />We ordered all three offerings on Brother Bird\'s menu and fell in love unconditionally with the whole bunch. Across the board, the soft serves were full-bodied, ultra smooth and creamy - such an incredibly sexy feel in the mouth! Furthermore, whatever yummy bits and bobs they came dressed with, worked to the best effect. Our exclamations of pleasure were heard non-stop as we ploughed enthusiastically into them.
The first thing that happened when I arrived at brother bird, was being told that the Mochi donut was out of stock. I had to come back in an hour. \n<br />Monster came back to the welcoming smell of fried sweet dough. Imagine deep frying Japanese Mochi. It\'s exactly as it sounds. Crispy on the outside, with a soft and chewy core. Top it with soft serve and viola you have an awesome dessert. \n<br />Monster says it was well worth the wait. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
This Honeydew Sago was a great refuge from the weather. The pandan-coconut soft serve was smooth and creamy, topped with coconut tuiles and refreshingly fresh honeydew. $5.50.
Longing for some Cookie-butter Soft Serve ($5.50) topped with bits of almond crunch and sea salt. A perfect item for a hot day.
A different kind of doughnut, made with glutinous rice flour so its body is dense and chewy within a lightly crisp, sugar-glazed exterior. I liked the texture, though the sheer massiveness of the doughnut was too much for me to stomach; I think this might actually fare better if portioned as bite-sized dango-like balls!
ACheap, fragrant speeculoos aroma yet awesome mochi donut with dual soft serve of butter cookie and coconut😱😱 Everything just clicks pretty well tgt😄👍
Love this! It\'s such a well-conceived reinterpretation of our local dessert, with lush pandan and coconut soft serve ice cream decked with fresh chopped honeydew, slivers of crunchy coconut tuille, and my favourite bit in the entire cup – honeydew \"sago\". 
From the same peeps behind Stateland Cafe, Brother Bird has a very simple menu. Didnt managed to try the rice donut so I got for myself a dual swirl (coconut + cookie butter) soft serve. Love the almond crunch topping 😍😍😍\n<br />On the side note, I did my nails (sponsored) today! Totally in love with the rainbow on my fingers. I am on cloud nine 💃💃💃
Glutinous rice is used in their mochi donut for its distinctive, soft and chewy texture. The mochi donut is freshly prepared upon order, which fried into golden-browned and gorgeously puffed, that has a soft and chewy interior with slightly crispy exterior. The contrast between the warm donut and cold soft serve is such a treat, topped with almond crunch and dehydrated raspberry that added a crunchy texture to it too. A great way to stay cool under this scorching hot weather!
Surprisingly refreshing, though I wished for a stronger pandan flavour. Soft serve was smooth and creamy, a great fusion from the traditional honeydew sago dessert!\n<br />find out more from the link in my profile!
Freshly prepared upon order, the mochi donut was fried to golden brown with a distinctive chewy and soft texture, complemented with a crispy outer layer. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Not a fan of rice donut, but its still nice, especially the softserve ice cream. Poop designed soft serve. Soft serve in a cup $5.50. Soft serve with rice donut $9.00.
Its a very nice dessert! the donut is crispy from the outside and gewy on the inside! With very soft serve ice cream on top!! Omg this combinaion is the bomb! Love it 
It\'s really crispy from the outside and chewy from the inside! Loving the soft serve too! They are gonna have more flavours so stay tuned to their account! \n<br />Thanks @brotherbirdbali for hosting us today!
Rich creamy soft serve is infused with the warm buttery flavours of Speculoos Cookie Butter, topped with layers of almond crush that gives a crunchy texture to it. You can also taste the distinctive taste of the sea salt that balanced out the sweetness of the soft serve. The owner \"Bird\" is mentioning about some new interesting flavors that he is still R&amp;D, so do look out for new exciting flavors every month!
The icy creamy cookie butter soft-serve pair with hot chewy mochi donut, decorated with almond crunch and dehydrated raspberries. First time I tried donut made out of mochi and instantly like this, plus it isn\'t as filling as waffles thus great as a after meal treat.
4 munchies: Ended my long Golden Jubilee weekend on a sweet note with this Speculoos soft serve, topped with almond crush, sea salt, and Lotus biscoff. Besides the almond crush that gave the fragrant and buttery soft serve some texture, I liked how the sea salt was distinct enough to contrast the sweetness with subtle hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove spices in the ice cream.
From the good folks of Stateland comes Brother Bird, the latest addition to singapore\'s soft serve family. Just two doors away from its big brother, this joint boasts a humble collection of books (good reads, really) and good ol\' ice cream. I had the cookie butter speculoos one served with almond crunch &amp; sea salt. The flavor was thick and rich and portion was pretty decent for $5.50. They also had free flow water and really good service so I was quite impressed. Cant wait to go back for their honeydew version. 
($5.50) Topped with almond crunches, sea salt and caramelized biscuit. Love it! Will definitely be back to try the other flavor as well as the home-made rice donut✨
Brother Bird, the latest concept by the people from Stateland Café, dislodges Honeycomb\'s beehive on Bali Lane to set up its nest serving coffee and soft serve. Only two flavours are currently available — the Honeydew Sago ($5.50), a refreshing treat that subtly infuses coconut and pandan flavours and is served with honeydew bits, sago and coconut tuiles, and the Cookie-Butter ($5.50), which is topped with almonds, sea salt and cookie crumbs. 
Lush rich creamy speculoos soft serve, topped with almonds, sea salt, cookie crumbs and decorated with more cookies. 
Had this delightfully refreshing flavour of Pandan &amp; coconut soft serve, topped with honeydew \"sago\" coconut tuiles and fresh honeydew. The combination of pandan and coconut can never go wrong and goes perfectly well with the sweet fragrant taste of fresh honey dew fruit and the jelly-like texture of sago in it. Definitely one of the better soft serve I had and is a good remedy to battle the heat!
a nice cookie-butter soft serve ($5.50) to battle to hot weather!
Using beans roasted from a friend, the blend used here is of the \"Scandinavian\" blend. Body was surprisingly light yet fruity; goes very well with the soft-serve here as it able to mediate the heavy flavours and refresh the tastebuds when it all gets too overpowering.
Came back to give a try on their latest product; the Mochi Donut. Pretty exciting concept as they decided to use Glutinous Rice to make their donut for its chewy texture rather than to use standard yeast-raised donut which they found not as matching with the soft-serve. Only double-flavour served for now; a combination of its current two flavours which is the Speculoos and Coconut flavours which combines into a somewhat Gula Melaka style flavour. Coming with creative toppings, it\'s interesting to find almond crunches and even traces of dehydrated Strawberry Chips and dehydrated Raspberries on the dessert. The dried berries gave the soft serve a crunchy texture and interesting tartness to the otherwise sweet dessert, while the Mochi was just of the right chewiness without making your jaws tired from over-chewing. Various ingredients are made in-house, and the owner (who is from Stateland) is pretty much passionate in his craft and takes pride with his creations in this concept which he calls \"back-to-basics\". A good place to beat the heat at Kampong Glam when it gets scorching hot outside.
Their [NEW] item released today showcased another trend - Softserve + Mochi Doughnuts.
[NEW] [Bugis] [Soft Launch: Jul 2015] Taking over the space where Honeycomb once was, Brother Bird is fledging their wings 3 days ago! We preferred the Honeydew Sago which had the local dessert rendition. Creamy and rich Pandan coconut Softserve was well complemented with honeydew sago. \n<br />Location: Bali Lane\n<br />Opening hours: 10am - 10pm (Wed-Mon), Closed Tue
The folks behind Stateland is at it again; Brother Bird now replaces now-defunct Honeycomb at the 30 Bali Lane lot with a somewhat refreshed interior that sells soft-serve similar to Softsrve situated in Malaysia for now. This flavour smartly infused local flavours by combining Pandan and Coconut soft-serve with honeydew bits, sago and coconut tuilles. The result is a smooth soft-serve with Pandan-like flavours which went well with the honeydew bits which give it a refreshing fruity sweetness. Currently they only serve two flavours (the other one being Speculoos) and coffee. Worth checking out in the area especially on a hot day!

The mochi croissant! With all the buttery, flaky elements of a croissant yet retaining a slightly chewy center.

ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: The most important factor for any cafes, restaurants or eateries is consistency. When you had something fabulous, you tend to remember the taste, smell and experience which would eventually be etched into your memory. Subsequently when you revisit the establishment again, you’d hope to relive the experience again. But unfortunately it’s not the case here. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />This is why, the Soft Serve is light, grainy, too airy and watery (even though it’s incorporated with air) it used to be better, much better. The redeeming factor is that at least the Salted Egg Yolk was molten and it bursts out of the Mochi. However the Salted egg yolk isn’t rich enough and the Mochi ball is forgettable. It once left a mark on my mind when I first tried it awhile ago but now it’s just a void.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #brotherbird #blacksesame #saltedegg #softserve #icecream #mochi #SugarCakePie #mochiballs #saltedeggyolk
At $7, you’ll get a mountain of softserve with cereals by the side and azuki beans hidden beneath. Whilst the softserve is creamy and refreshing, I would have preferred for a more distinct houjicha flavour.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Brother Bird Softserve\n<br />Address: 32, Bali Lane, Singapore 189866\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #brotherbird #brotherbirdsg

They directly replace the faulty waffle machine and now invite us to try their specialty “Mochi Doughnut” and the new equipped Waffle (on our next post) !\n<br />•\n<br />We agree that they do the Mochi Doughnut much better than the waffle.\n<br />The inner chewy mochi texture with the fried doughnut skin is perfect with the caramelised sugar in the outer layer. It’s still warm when it’s served. We choose the Houjicha Soft Serve for topping. This flavour is our most favourite in this place so far. There’re red bean and cereal for the topping too.\n<br />We definitely will back for this one.\n<br />p.s. The portion is big and filling enough for 2 persons.\n<br />*Note: they change the icecream flavour everyweek on December 🎉\n<br />Hand in frame by @gpaulinedj 💋\n<br />💰$15\n<br />🚝MRT Bugis\n<br />📍30 Bali Lane 189866 Singapore\n<br />⏱12-10PM (Wed-Mon); 6-10PM (Tue)\n<br />Rate (4/5) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ -VERY GOOD-\n<br />#brotherbird #brotherbirdsg #houjicha #softserve #mochidoughnut #statelandcafe #singaporeculinary #nomnom #nomnomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #burpple #sgfoddies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgig #dessertporn

It\'s not crispy, not fluffy, not red-velvety, yet it comes with burnt parts instead 😵 The earl grey soft serve was watery, and melts faster than the time we took to take pictures 😂 At least the earl grey taste is prominent and the cream cheese is tasty though 😅
Just a pastel purple.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />Taro milk tea softserve. It is sweet. More of a milky aftertone. Couldnt taste much of the taro. But I liked the crunchy coconut almond bits. Was unable to finish as the sweetness gets heavier on the palate. Best to share.
Apart from salted egg, there’s also peanut butter and earl grey chocolate burst too. Hoping that there would be a matcha burst one day ... 😆🙏🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#smitteneats #smittenchoice #burpple

it was like eating rose flavoured sorbet but in the form of soft serve.
-\n<br />Would you eat it?\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #brotherbirdsg #burpple #hungryghost
Similar impression to the S\'mores waffle, there\'s too much flavour in this waffle. The matcha softserve just didn\'t combine well with the cheese glaze. It wasn\'t an excellent dessert experience, but at least I\'m no longer curious about the desserts here 🙃\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />💲: $15++\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #makansg #sgfoodies #instafood #instafoodies #foodgasm #foodstagram #indofoodies #dessert #dessertstagram #instadessert #brotherbirdsg #brotherbird #foodgrammers #sgfoodgrammers #eatoutsg #sgcafe #wafflesg #waffle #icecream #redvelvet #sgculinary #burpplesg #burpple

Sweet and savoury, I\'m not sure how I can comprehend the taste. But this combination was surprisingly good. Perhaps cos I\'m a sucker for mochi!! 😅 However, the soft serve (earl grey) melted quite fast especially in this weather. 😤\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders #nomsterofficial #instadaily #potd #picoftheday #photooftheday #dessert #throwbackphoto #takemymoney #icecream #brotherbirdsg #love #latergram #foodie

For this week\'s special, they pay tribute to the recently foregone Gong Cha by having the bubble tea\'s classics in softserve formats, Taro Milk Tea and Earl Grey Milk Tea.

\"Wintermelon tea\" ($6) from Brother bird. 
Assorted Mochi Burst ($15)

What made me want to try this café? This interesting poop-like swirl and unlikely combination of ingredients. What would an avocado ice cream tastes like when it\'s topped with salted corn flakes, desiccated coconut and Gula Melaka? Honestly, it\'s an acquired taste. I wouldn\'t say I didn\'t like it, but I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the Wintermelon Tea Soft Serve. The latter is a better option if you prefer a refreshing treat. 💕\n<br />#burpple #icecreamisbae #brotherbird #softserveicecream
Avocado soft serve and mochi in three flavours ($15). Among the three, salted egg yolk was my favorite cos it wasn\'t too sweet as compared to the other two.
It is incredibly smooth and velvety which comes to a toothsome and abrupt end by melting instantly in your mouth bringing immense joy and instant gratification\n<br />The frozen strawberries nestled within the softserve and \'biscuits in disguise\' green macarons are just sidekicks to the pinkish main star

$15 // earl grey mochi 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Recall those slushies you used to get at 7-11?; this is nothing like that and everything you wanted it to be at the same time. Melt in your mouth crystals interceded by a flurry of watermelon juice in every mouthful. This is heaven in a cup with bits and bobs of crunchy macaron shells that you should ration out carefully for intermittent crunch
Watermelon soft serve is coming your way starting tomorrow!

Topped with homemade macarons for the textural contrast; this is welcome relief from the excruciating heat outside
This was really a new change from the usual milky and heavier soft serves, especially for people like @ksherena who didn\'t like the heavier kind will definitely welcome this!

No surprise why, the flavours were interesting, including this cookie butter softserve. The warm earl grey donut balls complemented well with their chocolate lava within. \n<br />Couldn\'t help but wonder if the phallic plating was in any way meant to reflect the name of the place. #burpple #BurppleSG #sgmakandiary #dessertsg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today
I\'m missing the cookie butter soft serve because I\'m a sucker for cookie butter anything. 😋
Seriously need something to help alleviate the impending heat stroke
wait till you pull apart that mochi matcha ball.
So do head over to try especially in this crazy weather!\n<br />#brotherbird #statelandcafe #exsgcafes #explorethehood #exploresingapore #exploreeverything #visualoflife #visitsingapore #yoursingapore #createexploretakeover #cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #burpple #bonappetitbkk #tslmakan
// {Classic Signature Rice Doughnut} at @BrotherBirdSG features their original Mochi Donuts with a picturesque swirl of cookie butter softserve, sprinkled with almond crunch, dehydrated raspberry and salted caramel sauce
These chewy mounds will leave you pleasantly surprised at its unconventional texture. However, since I\'m not so turned-on by the thought of bandung, my interests lie with that deeply satisfying soft serve, freckled with crispy freezed dried raspberries
New items available at @brotherbirdsg starting today! Soft serves are light creamy and they balance off well with both types of sweet donuts. The bursts are made of glutinous rice , hence taste like chewy Mochi. 👍🏻\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @brotherbirdsg for the invite. :)\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters

At the 4th stop on warm afternoon out on the #tastytastemakertour , this is a much needed respite. Soft serve comes in buttermilk and butter popcorn. I personally prefer the slightly savoury butter popcorn. Matcha donut balls were oozing with a generous dose of warm matcha filling. \'Note to self: raspberry donut balls were kickass！👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼\' #burpple #burpplesg #brotherbirdsg #foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #matcha #donuts #sgcafe #dessert

Chose th \"Liu Sha\" version. Nice soft serve too.

Loved the soft serves but the donut was just too filling.
Matcha tasted a little strange but the cookie butter soft serve was yummy🍦 Usually not a fan of mochi but I love the the crispy, caramelized exterior 😍
The mix of warm doughnut with cold soft serve was satisfying. \n<br />Not pocket friendly enough to warrant a second visit. Doesn\'t raise sufficient happiness utility in me. I miss my dunkin\' donut\'s mochi doughnut. #lexiaosad

Nevertheless went to try despite the closure due to the super hot weather. Not too bad actually :) #burpple
#brotherbird
I\'ve never imagined rice donut to be this good! Best eaten when the mochi are still warm on the inside and the crispy exterior still gives that extra crunch.
Ordered the classic item on the menu with dual swirl of matcha and cookie butter flavour for $12.90. The taste of the matcha ice cream overpowers the cookie butter ice cream. To be honest, I couldn\'t taste much of the cookie butter ice cream. The Mochi donut at the bottom of the twirl was the bomb!! It was incredible. It wasn\'t too jer-lat as I would have expected. It was crispy on the outside and soft in the outside. The almond flakes was a perfect topping for this dessert as it brought along a sour and sweet combination. I would definitely return for a second round and would strongly recommend this to people who love Mochi and matcha. This is the best combination 👍🏻
|\n<br />Riding on the soft serve craze, Brother Bird serves a variety of ice cream options with added surprises such as salted egg donuts, rice mochi donuts and even a Mont Blanc version. However, we decided to go for what they do best, which is the soft serve ice cream. In come the Cookie-Butter ($6), which is essentially speculoos soft serve, almond crunch and a pinch of sea salt. A very good cup of dessert, especially when we have such an erratic weather. The tinge of saltiness creates a good balance so that you do not be overwhelmed with the sweetness.\n<br />|\n<br />However, more could be done in terms of the cafe ventilation as we were hit with a stench of oil smell upon entering. We sat approximately an hour inside and came out feeling greasy.\n<br />|\n<br />Address: 30 Bali Lane, Singapore 189966\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #burpple #burppletastemaker #foodporn #foodphoto #makan #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================

#ThisIsTheShit right here! #brotherbird #icecream&amp;donuts #LooksLikePoopButTastesSoGood #sgfood #burpple
So this #poo is cookie butter flavored #softserve and is filled and sprinkled with speculoos- a type of spiced shortcrust biscuit, almonds and seasalt which we would have prefered a stronger presence. \n<br />All is good for this little store still in it\'s soft launch phase. The owner was kind enuff to offer us free of charge as he was running out on the toppings but of course we paid up. Hopefully next time there will be more versions and stocks available for customers.
