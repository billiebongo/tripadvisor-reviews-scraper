Different but actually expected it to be crispier. Got the medium for 4 but large may have been better especially if there are big eaters in the group.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sgrestaurant #hawkerfood #beehoon #burpple
The golden brown crust on the top of the fluffy and moist beehoon just looks so droolsome.

A special dish. Loved the crispy parts. 
Thinking of that chao tar bee hoon (fried vermicelli)
Here for the chao da bee hoon and wasn\'t disappointed #singapore #tzechar #dinner #heartland
