The first winning factor is their free-flow tom yum soup base that is made from scratch in house. It might not be as rich or spicy as I expected it to be, but the soup is prepared to cater to those with lower tolerance towards spicy food. The hot pot also came with a wide variety of seafood and meat ‚Äî my favourite was their roast pork ‚Äî which gave so much sweetness and crustacean flavours to the soup. This was when the soup became even more addictive and one simply could not stop slurping it down.
Sweater weather screams even more cravings for hot and spicy food! Helmed by Thai chefs, Soi Thai Soi Nice boasts an extensive menu with enjoyable authentic Thai dishes. Level of spice is muted down to suit local palettes but lovers of spice don\'t have to worry, for like this Royal Thai Hot Pot, options of mild, normal or spicy are available. But really, just go straight for the 3rd! You can even make special requests for even more rich and fiery goodness as I found the highest level still ok. üî• With a refillable house made tom yum base and a whole lot of ingredients - crayfish, prawns, mussels, roast pork, sausages, enoki mushrooms, maggie and eggs, you can expect an aroi mak mak meal with friends! Remember to get the seafood out quickly to avoid overcooking them.
You can even round up your friends to have a pre-CNY reunion hotpot. (They have a hotpot meant for 2 too) üòú. It comes with a tom yum soup that has the perfect tanginess and you can choose less spicy, normal or spicy. üç¥\n<br />Just look at the pot brimming with ingredients! The recipes for all the food items are the brain child of the Thai head chef and you can trust that it is as authentic as it gets!! üç¥\n<br />Thank you @burpple for the invitation and @theprsalon &amp; @soithaisoinice for hosting us! #burpple #thaifood #tomyum #soithaisoinice
To stay true to the Thai roots, drinks here are on the sweeter end, but the kitchen is open to adjusting the sugar level if you‚Äôd prefer something less sweet. Strong red tea flavours here with a thick consistency but the lime slices helps to nicely balance it out.
Rainy season calls for something warm for the tummy and this Royal Thai Hot Pot (Big Pot) cannot be more perfect! It is made with a house made tomyum paste with 3 different spice levels ‚Äî we had the most spicy one but I didn\'t find it that fiery hot so it should be fine for most of us. It comes with a generous amount of prawns, mussels, crayfish, enoki mushrooms, sausages, eggs and noodles. 
This might only be my second time trying Thai-version of otah, but I enjoyed this a lot. Though I found it too milky for my liking, I love the fragrance and texture of the steam egg and otah. Unlike the typical Singaporean otah with bold flavours, this Thai-style otah came with squids and it had subtle tangy and curry taste, best to be eaten with a bowl of rice.
On rainy days, and any other days, Soi Thai Soi Good serve up a mean seafood hotpot. Fret not to people whom isn\'t into spices, the broth is pretty tame and mild, while maintaining the essence of a good tom yum. The seafood so fresh, that you might think that they are taking a dip into the hotpot, just chilling. The pork belly, added good old fashion savoury kick to it. That chewy instant mee is a must when having anything thai cause we all know how much Singaporeans love their \"mama noodles\". Generous and huge in portion, this pot is set to warm and win many hearts alike.
While many are already familiar with the sight of Thai mookata in Singapore, Soi Thai Soi Nice strived to offer a more serious Thai steamboat experience and imo they suceeded! The first winning factor is their free-flow tom yum soup base that is made from scratch in house. It might not be as rich or spicy as I expected it to be, but the soup is prepared to cater to those with lower tolerance towards spicy food. The hot pot also came with a wide variety of seafood and meat ‚Äî my favourite was their roast pork ‚Äî which gave so much sweetness and crustacean flavours to the soup. This was when the soup became even more addictive and one simply could not stop slurping it down.
Headed by Thai chefs, get to enjoy authentic Thai dishes that might not be found in other places.
The Seafood Tom Yum Soup is pleasant and diners have a choice of red or clear soup.

Their tomyum soup is freshly made daily and we can even choose the level of spiciness. Well, this normal spicy level is not much of a kick, so just go for higher level of spiciness head-on.  There is a big pot option to feed 3-4pax too ($68.80). Located at L2 of Alexandra Central: @soithaisoinice\n<br />.\n<br />#soithaisoinice #thaifood #theprsalon #hotpot #JoEuGoEat

Since I was in the area, I popped in for dessert and tea.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />A purplish jelly like ball and ruby chestnuts infused with blue pea flower. Taste of the ball is bland. Honey provided by the side gives it alittle sweet flavor. Blue pea tea, served hot. Even though there are no robust flavors, eating and drinking it felt light and clean.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />A pretty flower that has potent antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties and protects the skin against premature aging.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />The origjnal presentation of the purple ball was on a paper boat. I actually requested it to be placed on a plate. I waited half hour for the dessert because they ran out and was preparing a fresh batch. Shermin (staff) was very apologetic for making me wait. She re-plated my dessert and made sure the ball was near perfect. I stayed longer as it was raining cats and dogs. It was so relaxing sitting by the window and watching the rains. Do you like the purple reflection below the pot? Had a nice time chatting with Shermin. A very sweet girl, indeed! Thank you Shermin @soithaisoinice for being so warm and friendly.

Succulent and feisty with a bit of chili to spice it up a notch, these make a terrific addition to the tom yum hot pot that I would highly recommend at Soi Thai Soi Nice.
It will take you a minute to warm up to this dish (warning: some of you might never come to like it.¬†Acquired taste.), the herbaceous stink of Cha Om is not something you naturally want to dig into.
