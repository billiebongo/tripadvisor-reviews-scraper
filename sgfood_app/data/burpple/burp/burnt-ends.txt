I\'ve never really been a fan of pulled pork burgers, but I just had to try this dish having heard so much about it on Burpple. The first thing that I noticed was that it was so juicy, and not because of the sauce but from the meat itself. The bun has been perfectly toasted with that chipotle aioli, and the cole slaw (which could have been bolder with acidity in my opinion) gave a nice crunch to each bite. One of the best pulled pork burgers I\'ve tried out there!
Such a simple sounding dish, but once you take your first bite... you know that this dish has been iterated over and over again for it to get to this point. The brown butter sauce is simply amazing and so rich that it elevates the simple leek along with the perfect crunch of the roasted hazelnuts. Simply divine!
Having been to Argentina last year, chimichuri became one of my favourite things to eat with steak. This dish paid the perfect homage to the sauce and the roast beef simply melted and pulled away easily with each bite. It\'s finished with this bold aioli sauce at the bottom that will leave you craving for more!
There is an art in achieving a perfect balance when working with such bold flavours in such a small bite. You won\'t be disappointed with this to start your meal off, as it awakens your palette with the rich, sweet, tangy Beef Marmalade followed by the fresh crunch of the pickle that gives you that burst of acidity that your mouth craves...
It\'s smoky, tangy, rich and refreshing all at the same time.
#Ribeye Lip with a Dijon based creamy sauce. We feel it went better with the tangy sauce with breadcrumbs for asparagus.
Don\'t underestimate this dish. Shared a 200g piece between me and my friend and it packed a punch. Meat was succulent, bone marrow gravy was rich and flavourful. Everything paired very nicely together, I was surprised when I took a bite out of the meat, sauce and the salad on the side. Salad adds a light bite and cuts through the richness of this dish. Definitely worth trying.
After this, I\'m never eating another pulled pork burger in my life. You have never really tasted a real pulled pork burger if you never tried burnt ends\'. Forget all you\'ve ever known about pulled pork burgers. This one here melts in your mouth, explodes with spices, full of depth and robust flavours. The slaw adds a nice crunch. Everything in burger was carefully thought out to create the perfect one. It is really worth the hype.
The beef marmalade is a must have here. Don\'t leave without trying the the tartare - beef that\'s hand-chopped right before you and checked by the head chef before it\'s served. The chicken wings were delicious too.
Tiny, but it packs a punch. The pickles complemented the beef really well 👍🏼
Awesome food. Fresh, flavourful, a must eat! Not forgetting, the chef is hot looking !!  Satisfaction to the stomach and eyes. 😏
Initially I thought it was a mashed potato with quince but I was so wrong! The slightly sweet and fruity paste with hints of umami, complemented the pork so well like marriage made in heaven. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Burnt Ends, Singapore

There’s something incredibly honest about a solid slab of meat coaxed over open flames into a lovely charred outer while remaining tender and juicy on the inside. Not just the meat, the sauce is dizzyingly impressive too. Both work perfectly together, the flavour profiles of each being brought out by the other. 
The objective was to taste as many OMG dishes as possible, and sticking to two courses and dessert was no way to win. The only limitation was the size of the table. Our third plate - roast beef and tartare salad.
The very best bits of a roast, but on toast, with mayo and sweet pickles. Why must the most delicious things also be the trickiest and messiest to eat?
Currently ranked 70th on the World\'s 50 Best Restaurants list and 14th on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list, Burnt Ends is a modern Australian barbecue joint tucked away in a narrow strip of shop house space in Chinatown’s Teck Lim Road. 
The end result of the flame torched marshmallow is this, beautifully crusted marshmallow that is caramelized on the outside and gooey on the inside. What\'s different is that it has a slight lemon zest to complement the sweetness.
gooey on the inside, slight crisp on the outside. The ice cream is indeed smokey, a little too much though, in my opinion.
The pineapple sits innocently among what seems like rum creme brûlée and the base is glazed with caramel. Perfect for all sweet tooth-ers out there 💯
Utterly decadent. This dish was superb. The cow died for a good cause.
This W.A Marron with tobiko is simply sumptuous and succulent 🦂
The Burnt Ends Sanger, which comprises of savoury pulled pork, mile spicy chipotle and coleslaw, didn\'t just MEAT expectations, it exceeded it 👍🏼
Even though the truffle taste wasn\'t strong enough and tasted more like bonito flakes, this is a plate of greens I\'d happily devour.
Huge ass scallop grilled with delicious X.O. sauce which thankfully, didn’t mask the fresh scallop taste
Although really yummy with a good citrus flavour, paying $12 for 3 long pieces of vegetables seems too much to me 😅 ⭐️ 3/5 ⭐️
So good I could keep eating more - the tender &amp; flavorful beef went well with the pickles, onions &amp; sourdough bread to make each bite delicious 😋 ⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️

When a restaurant has a 3-month-long waiting list, *sob sob*, you make the most of whatever from there you can get your grubby paws on.\n<br />Fortunately, the iconic Sanger of Burnt Ends (thank you Chef @dpynto 🙏) always does a great job of consoling me.\n<br />Somehow, I am able to find solace in the warm embrace of its pillowy soft brioche buns kept far apart by a thick and insanely delicious layer of the most moist pulled pork, crisp purple slaw and chipotle mayo.\n<br />Of course it\'s not the same as sitting at one of the highly-coveted seats in the restaurant and feasting till I am a fat, mean, moaning machine but it will have to do. For now.
Beef Marmalade and Pickles ($14) was packed with flavours; sweet, smoky, tart, and richness of the beef and caramelised onions. One of my favourite dishes that night! #asia50best
First time having duck heart! Duck Hearts w Peri Peri ($10) love the tender, chewy texture and tasted like mini duck chunks, couldn\'t taste the spice (too much aioli?) but smokiness/unami flavour masked my fear for offals so well #asia50best
Started our dinner w perfect Warmed Oysters ($8 per oyster) salty, buttery bisque with fresh, plump oyster, hands down the best oyster I\'ve had so far 🔥🔥🔥 #asia50best
I was actually dumbfounded at how good this Flank Steak ($26 per 100g) with burnt onion and bone marrow was. These delicate pieces of medium rare flank paired with the creaminess from the burnt onion sauce and bone marrow was the showstopper. Flavours were on point and the smokiness from each element made it such a gastronomical experience.\n<br />•\n<br />Burnt Ends\n<br />Address: 20, Teck Lim Road, Singapore 088391 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #restaurantsg #burntendssg #asia50best #worlds50best
Back at my favorite restaurant in Singapore watching the open kitchen work its magic on the food. The menu is written everyday based on the availability of ingredients and I\'m so glad that the onglet was on the menu on our visit!
Belly chop that looked like fat &gt; meat but I\'m glad that the pork belly did not taste greasy at all. Tender meat with a lovely charred edges. Barbecue food should be all like this!
A new item on the menu to us was the Kingfish fillet with a tomato and pesto based sauce. The fillet is said to be cooked to a medium rare with a slightly pink center but ours turned out to be more of medium well. Nonetheless, the fillet was fresh with a tender fish meat in the center while the outer edges were slightly tougher. The zesty citrusy sauce also complemented the fillet nicely. However, I still think that meat is Burnt Ends\' speciality!
Grilled to a complete black before stripping down its outer layer to unveil the juicy insides of the leek, you can\'t miss this at Burnt Ends. The leek is then drenched with a warm brown butter sauce and hazelnuts, for a buttery, sweet and crunchy taste experience!
Flank, Burnt Onion &amp; Bone Marrow ($26+/100g)
Mayura Cube Roll ($50+/100g)
Mint &amp; Chocolate ($12+)
Mini but packed with so much punch, every mouthful was an explosion of flavour. The umami marmalade sauce and slightly sour pickles complemented the tender beef pieces perfectly. \n<br />A must-order every time you visit @burntends_sg !
The end result of that massive flaming was this beautifully crusted marshmallow that is caramelized on the outside and oh-so-gooey on the inside. The marshmallow also came with a slight citrusy twist - an orange zest to complement the sweetness. Personally, I thought the roasted marshmallow ($2 a pop) was slightly overdone. Nevertheless, it was still very enjoyable.
Honestly didn\'t expect much with this Orange Sponge Cake with Smoked Ice Cream ($14) but it just blew our minds away. The smoked ice cream reeks of yummy bacon aroma, we were trying our best to fish out any bacon bits inside, but to no avail. But the star of the dish was the orange sponge cake that was so buttery and moist, yet slightly crusty on the outside. Expect to sink your teeth into the slightly crispy and perfectly moist batter, smothered with bacon-tasting ice cream. MUST. ORDER.
I had my terrible share of steak recently - anything from tough, slimy, overcooked... Yet every time I\'m at Burnt Ends, they never fail to wow me with their steak. This Flank with Onion Sauce and Bone Marrow ($26/100g) was perfectly medium-rare. Seductively red but there was almost no blood on our plates after finishing this entire portion. I loved the robust beefy flavours, the thick luscious onion sauce and the irresistibly creamy bone marrow. Oh. So. Perfect.
I am so frigging screwed\n<br />.\n<br />All I need now is a drink\n<br />Something that brings me to the brim\n<br />So I can breathe and start to think\n<br />Hmm...\n<br />What to eat for tonight\'s din din
The marshmallow is a killer-bomb\n<br />Torched with orange and cinnamon \n<br />One bite, I know it\'s worth my monies\n<br />So sinful that I ate my mummy\'s.\n<br />And with this new love I can\'t wait to get chummy
Only @burntends_sg can convert a non-leek eater. If you are or know someone who dislike leeks, you know where to go.\n<br />.\n<br />I have never thought that leek can taste this gooood. The giant leek was chopped into bite size potion, soft and fibrous, with none of that onion-like taste and smell. Totally in love with this 😻😻👍!
.\n<br />Pop it in and you can feel the quail egg literally bursting in your mouth, followed by the luscious flow of yolk coating your tongue; whereas the caviar added exquisiteness and richness to a taste that can\'t be any more than splendid.\n<br />.\n<br />One of Asia\'s 50 top best restaurant. @burntends_sg definitely lives up to its reputation. With a majestic built-in wood fire oven, Burnt Ends delivers most dishes in the form of grills; Skillfully executed with intense flavors. I simply can\'t wait to go back again! 😻😻
Pure bliss. Bone marrow was like warm butter that melted atop the beef, leading to mouthgasms one after another
Amazingly rich. Hazelnuts soaked in brown butter led to such a flavourful, nutty sauce! Every mouthful was accompanied by such a fragrant whiff of creamy butter that I couldn\'t stop complimenting the dish!!!
This to me was the highlight of our meal at Burnt Ends. Cooked perfectly and if I am allowed to be slightly picky at the dish, wished it was slightly more charred. topped off with bone marrow that melts in your melt and onion relish sauce , it was a treat to my tummy 😋
at $20 , this is really value for money. No wonder this is one of their most popular dishes at Burnt Ends which is also awarded Top 50 restaurants of the world! The sesame bun was not too dry , the slaw and pulled pork was moist and as you can see is almost bursting out of the burger. Try to make a reservation before going .
Looks like a typical pulled pork burger at first sight but none of the burgers I\'ve eaten before is as good as this! The pork was tender and cooked well and the coleslaw and chipotle aioli complimented well without overpowering the meat. Now I can understand why there are so many rave reviews about it!
Where do I begin..? The tender, juicy, tasty 10-hr pulled pork shoulder? Or the perfect marriage of the creamy, mildly-spicy chipotle aioli with coleslaw that was surprisingly light so no gelat-ness at all; giving an additional dimension to its texture (I don\'t even like coleslaw) - soaked up by the fluffy brioche buns with black sesame seeds for a light, nutty fragrance and delicate crunch? I do think it\'s one of the better burgers around with a good balance of flavours, textures and is pretty hearty (I was kinda full halfway through but I HAD to finish it because it was that good!) so despite the rather hefty price tag of $20 I will gladly order this again 😋 
Now, this is wonderful. When this is first served to your table, the like zest immediately hits you. The ice-cream goes wonderfully with the sugar cake. The combination of the smokey flavor and the perfectly baked sugar cake was mind boggling. #dessert #icecream @burntends_sg #burntends #burntendssg #dinner #birthday #reservation
The burnt ends\' Sanger! Pulled pork shoulder, Cole slaw, chipotle aioli, all stuffed between a freshly buttered brioche bun. The burger was so juicy, and full of flavor. Each ingredient played its part in bringing the burger to the next level. It\'s definitely a must try. #burger #Sanger @burntends_sg #burntends #burntendssg #dinner #birthday #reservation
But what really makes this dish is that creamy hollandaise-Dijon mustard sauce made in house. I literally wiped the whole plate clean! @burntends_sg #burntends #burntendssg #dinner #birthday #reservation #crunch #crackling
For starters, marmalade and pickles are just someone I don\'t eat. Got this recommended to me by waiter Fabio, I could never say no to a recommendation, and I was glad I took it up. That sweet chutney like onion, was cooked with the beef. The caramelization that took place was stunning. Topped off with pickles, which provided the tartness for the dish. It\'s just a match made in heaven. I was simply blown away. @burntends_sg #burntends #burntendssg #dinner #birthday #reservation
Belated birthday dinner with the boy at the 70th best restaurant in the worlds and 30th in Asia!\n<br />We had the Beef Marmalade and Pickles and Garlic Shoots and Gremolata for starters, Onglet with Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow and the Burnt Ends Sanger (photo) for mains, and Mango, Cardamom and Biscuit for desserts. Every dish is brings satisfaction beyond words.\n<br />Loved everything about this place; the food, the ambience, the layout, the staff... Highly recommended for date nights or simple catchups!
Perfectly toasted brioche buns with a neat layer of melted cheese sandwich the flavourful pork and lightly soured coleslaw. My favourite of the lot! 
At 7$ a pop, you\'d expect a lot from this. And don\'t worry, it doesn\'t disappoint. Each bite is packed with an almost umami beefy flavour that is balanced out very nicely with the pickles. 
So thankful for @ubereats_sg for making @burntends_sg pulled pork sanger available anytime during lunch or dinner service. Of course I can\'t compare this take-away to my experience dining in there, but it\'s pretty much the same taste I remembered. Juicy pulled pork with just nice kick in the marination. The only downside was the slightly soft and soggy buns as they rapidly soaked up the juice, but wells no complaint when I could enjoy the burger (at half-price thanks to $10 off for first-timers) while working on my laptop on my bed.
Thanks to uberEats, I can finally skip the hour long queue and the two month reservation waiting list (ayyyy lmao) to get down and dirty with this bad boy in about half an hour.
Still warm when it arrived, it was pure bliss biting into this uber flavourful burger! \n<br />To even sweeten the deal, use my code \'eats-wok13\' to get $20 off your first order (psst, that means FREE burger!!!), what are you waiting for!!!
Loved the luxurious butter which gave a nice and moist texture to it. The perfectly baked crust also juxtaposed the delicately sculpted vanilla creme (so pure that you could spot the pods!) that sits atop!
But really, we only paid $1.40 each for our burgers since you can get $20 off on your first order on Ubereats using discount codes. 😂 \n<br />Not wanting the burgers to get soggy, we sat on the floor of the mall like uni kids during orientation and ravaged our burgers. Stuffed close to overflowing with pulled pork, the chipotle aioli helped to lighten the heavy burger. Super tender and moist, being full is no excuse for not finishing this beauty of a burger 😋
Yep, it really does look that red. Don\'t get me wrong it\'s juicy, moist, melt-in-your-mouth and just everything good; but for someone like me who prefers her beef medium and her lamb medium-well, this is a tad too raw for me. If you can get past the colour though, you\'d prolly love this cause everything\'s executed perfectly and the flavours are just dayum.
One of the signatures, this medium-rare onglet was melt-in-your-mouth tender with perfectly charred burnt ends. The robust flavoured gravy carried a hint of sweetness only to have the acidity of the accompanying salad cut through beautifully to give a balanced after taste. If that is not enough indulgence, how about some bone marrow to top it off?
10-Hour Pulled Pork Shoulder, Chipotle Aioli and Coleslaw on a Brioche Bun. (Delivered by @Uber_SING #UberEATS; use \'eats-uberbryandmlee\' for $20 off your first order!)
Best dish of the night.
Probably the most popular dish at Burnt Ends, the Burnt Ends\' Sanger (S$20+).
Without fail, every guest at @burntends_sg will be trying this.
Finally got to try Burnt Ends - No 14 on Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants and No 70 on World\'s 100 Best Restaurants. To my surprise, the food is decently priced and furthermore, no service charge even though the service was excellent. Who said you have to pay exorbitant prices for quality stuff?!
Even though I only got to try The Burntends\' Sanger ($20), I was wowed by it totally and devoured the entire burger in a matter of minutes. The pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw and chipotle aioli sandwiched between a freshly baked brioche bun was a match made in heaven. This is probably the best pulled pork burger I have ever tried in my life. *Now to make a reservation to the actual restaurant to try out more stuff*
A definite must try at Burnt Ends which is slowly recovering to a somewhat good reputation in my memory. And no I\'m not a convert yet… but if you gimme a plate full of beef marmalade and a stash of these bite-sized crunchy &amp; creamy biscuits, then I might give the place a thumbs up. Maybe. 😏\n<br />#BurntEndsSG #MonteCarlo
Had the most spontaneous foodie fun in awhile the other night thanks to @veronicaphua. We ended up at Burnt Ends for supper after the Beerfest Asia preview and I kinda hoped they could give me a better impression than I left with after my first visit long ago (so I would stop frowning everytime someone mentioned the name Burnt Ends 😝). This was highly recommended by Sir Party Pooper (aka @sir.fried.chicken) and after tasting it I can vouch for this too. Perfect proportions of tender meat and pickles in each bite. I would have this again any day and recommend everyone get their own serving of it cos it\'s really too good to share.\n<br />Will I still frown the next time I hear the name Burnt Ends? 🤔\n<br />#BurntEndsSG
Blackmore\'s cube roll! This is god of beef. It literally melts in your mouth! Price tag for this 200+g portion - $200
I can recall the magnificent taste of this marbled-like-art steak from a previous visit and was very pleased to relive it all over again two nights ago.
\nThey\'re not always available but get these Monte Carlo biscuits if they are. Please. Your tastebuds will be eternally grateful.
The sanger that sings to my stomach every single time. That delicious, tender and moist pulled pork, slaw, mayo and cheese work wonders together. If only I had the whole burger to myself instead of just a quarter.
After hearing endless raves about this from my dining partners in crime I was mucho excited to try this but alas, the marrow had an off-puttingly strong varnish-like or aniseed flavour to it, I couldn\'t tell what. I\'m willing to give this a second go the next time on the chance that this was an off batch. 
As if their mouth watering Flank and Burnt Onion weren\'t enough, we took the bull by the horns and got ourselves a second steak. Sublimely buttery and marbled Mayura Station Australian Full Blood Wagyu scotch fillet, its exterior purified by grill fire whilst remaining gloriously rare within. 
I dare you to resist those perfectly cooked till medium rare ruby hued slices of perfection. What made it even better were the paper thin slivers of absolutely unctuous, melt in your mouth bone marrow. If only there were more.
Spires of charred fennel jut out of a creamy burrata lake studded with orange segments. The combination of subtle anise flavour paired with milky burrata and bursts of sweetness from the citrus make this a nice little palate cleanser and interlude between the meatier courses at Burnt Ends.
A nicely cooked piece of fresh fish is always welcome, but I\'m not so sure whether it was worth the price tag.
\"Eat your vegetables\", my mum always said, and this is a plate of greens I\'d happily devour (in small portions).
I studiously try to avoid the adjectives \"insanely\" and \"amazing\", but these flavour bombs on toast deserve those labels, and rightly so.
An exceptionally well crafted drink by anyone\'s standards, this ruby hued elixir boasts surprising depth and balance for such a simple cocktail.
This smart grill house in the Keong Siak enclave is the place to go for all things smoked. We are putting our money on the egg-cellent appetiser, Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar ($15). Although pricey, the dish is worth every cent. Expect a perfectly smoked, chilled quail egg, with a molten liquid centre, and topped with a dollop of caviar. It\'s the perfect mix of savoury and sweet, and just the thing to get the party started.
Not my favourite dish the first time i came, and it still isn\'t now. It\'s an exceptional burger no doubt (pillowy, buttery sesame seed buns, crunchy purple cabbage) but the pulled pork was a tad stringy and.. canned tuna-esque. Good flavour though
This was some indescribable pairing!! It was a crazy explosion but also balance of pretty strong flavours. Natural sweetness of the plump leek, saltiness and roasty brown butter, finished off with nuttiness and variation in texture from the hazelnuts. Classic case of the whole being greater than the sum if its parts. Veggies can be pretty damn amazing dishes and shine on their own.
Tastiest dish of the night. So so so good and it\'s been a while since i\'ve had such an exceptional dish. Some dishes are technically great, but once in a while an exceptional dish, on top of everything, makes you feel differently inside. This was one of them for me.
It was $15 per serving so we ended up ordering just one. Since i had this on my first visit in 2013 (wow has it been almost 3 years) i let him have it. He liked it.
This tart is something else. Not only were the berries themselves incredibly fresh and tart, the biscuit-like crust were enough to win us over. And also the vanilla chantilly 😍
A pulled-pork burger done right by the folks at Burnt Ends. None of that dry stuff overly drenched in BBQ sauce - the pork here is fork tender with just the right amount of sauce. Creamy and packed-full of flavour. Such a steal at $20 a piece. Definitely a must-have when you come here. 
At only $2 a pop, there\'s no reason not to get this (or a couple). The slightly lemony/orange marshmallow was toasted such that the exterior was a crispy layer of caramelisation, while the inside was gooey and soft. This beats all the self-BBQ ones you\'ve had so far for sure. 
Unfortunately, they weren\'t serving onglet that day. But this was still the highlight of the meal. The beef was super juicy and tender. It had an amazing sear while the inside remained pink and quite rare, which allowed the steak to retain all its natural flavours. Never had bone marrow, but I was surprised at how it just melts in your mouth. Loved their onion sauce, which paired really well with the beef. Wouldn\'t mind paying for 300g all to myself. 
Crazy good starter! The beef topping had an almost a jam-like consistency and was perfect with the toasted sourdough. The flavour combination was amazing - it was sweet, sour, and smoky. The pickles gave its nice crunch and tartness to the whole dish. A bit pricey, but definitely worth the money. 
Holy cow, this meat is expensive. I don\'t eat beef but made some exceptions for the Burnt Ends experience. Lightly seasoned with salt to let the grilled wagyu\'s original taste shine. I\'m not a good judge of this (because a \"Kao\" doesn\'t eat its own kind haha #badjoke), so relying on my friends\' verdict, this was \"pretty good\" but \"there are better beef elsewhere\".
It\'s hard to imagine why this burger is so raved about, until you try it for yourself. Juicy tender shreds of pork and slaw slathered with creamy delectable chipotle aioli, sandwiched between cushiony brioche buns. I secretly wished I didn\'t have to share this with my other two pals but had to leave space for the rest of the meal anyway. Fingers and lips were licked post-burger savage.
Intriguing play on the palate fusing woody, smoky, salty, fishy accents... The appetite was very well whet for the dishes coming up.
Was rather sad when there was no onglet during my visit at Burnt Ends, and thus the flank. Flank itself is a fairly lean cut but not exactly tender and so, I had to give it an extra biting time. Every component blends very well, including that seemingly impotent salad. The best part was definitely the burnt onion mixed with discs of bone marrow, eaten with the flank. Foodgasm on every bite! On a side note, congratulations for the achievement! Ranked 14 for the best restaurants in Asia this year, Burnt Ends have indeed wow-ed me with the impeccable service and lovely dishes.
Sure enuff, every item that we ordered was so good that we can\'t decide which was the highlight of the night. Silly gal then jokingly said the highlight was the Sanger as it was a tad too salty for our liking. Nevertheless, it was a great meal with every dish being above average. In frame was the smoked quail egg and caviar ($15). Highly recommended this! The smokiness was on point with e caviar lightly seasoned the molten lava quail eggs. So so good 😋😋😋 Burnt Ends should be on foodpanda man. But then again, they refused to see me 😭😭😭
My favourite of the meal: an explosive starter. It\'s explosive in terms of flavour -- savoury yet sour with a little bit of sweet and smoky taste. While it might be priced rather steeply as compared to their mains, this is a must-order and definitely my recommendation if it\'s available on the day of your visit. 
No reason not to have this when its at $2 a pop, and very easily conquered even if you are full. There\'s something about this burnt orange cinnamon marshmallow that draws me to it, till it led me to order another one because I can\'t resist! 
With the menu prepared on a daily basis, you have no idea how thrilled we were to find onglet on the menu! Our third visit and we knew we needed 400g of this charcoal grilled onglet. It\'s served with a burnt onion sauce, shaved bone marrow and vinaigrette watercress salad. The citrusy salad was such a simple side that goes so well with the steak! Totally worthy of being Number 1 on @burpple\'s Hot 100 places in 2015!
Burnt Ends Sanger — tender flavorful pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw, chipotle aioli sandwiched between two buttery fluffy brioche buns. This taste never gets old. Sink your teeth into the buns, and fill your mouth with the creamy flavorful pulled pork with a tinge of spice. Getting the Sanger fix is now made easier with their newly implemented Sanger take-away service! 😉
One of the newer dishes at Burnt Ends, this involves some grilled corn which were completely charred on the skin and stripped down to the kernels. It comes with a uni - butter quenelle and fire roasted nori, seasoned with salt and lemon zest. Proceed to mix well and it will be ready for eating! Slightly disappointed by this dish as the uni taste was very very mild - tasted way too buttery and the watery texture causes the nori to lose its crispiness. 
Minced beef with onions and mustard cooked till it turns into a jam-like end product and served atop a toasted sourdough finished off with some shaved pickles. So much umami in this one!! Highly recommended to order this when you\'re there. 
Simple ingredients cooked to perfection - pulled pork shoulder, slaw, chipotle aioli and an oh so fluffy brioche bun. You owe it to yourself to try this once in your lifetime. \n<br />#burntends #burntendssg #burpple
Excuse me while I go get more lardo to stuff my face with. I need one of these ovens from @burntends_sg!
Essentially crispy flatbread with perhaps the lightest, most flavorful taramasalata next to what I remember eating at @artichoke_sg. Definitely a must try when you\'re at @burntends_sg after waiting hours for your seat just because \'You arrived at 6.30 sir, that\'s too late.\' #burntends #burntendssg #burpple
Break through the crusty exterior to get to the gooey center perfumed with orange and cinnamon. At $2 a pop, I would have a few more in a heartbeat. \n<br />#burntends #burntendssg #burpple
This Sanger - best thing I had at Burnt Ends. The 10 slow-cooked pulled pork is moist, succulent, and savoury - not sweet or BBQ-sauce spammed. Each bite released a torrent of juices that\'s just so so satisfying. And look at the ample meat stuffed into that burger: you can\'t even see the bottom bun! That plus fluffy buns, melty cheese, oozy sauce: we\'ve got ourselves a winner.
The single most expensive meal I\'ve had in recent months, and worth every single buck. Here\'s the Beef Marmalade and Pickles (S$14++): sweet beef mince atop perfectly toasted (damn yummy btw) slice of sourdough, topped with shaved pickles. It\'s expensive no doubt especially for the bite-sized portion, but it was absolutely delicious, very impressive, and definitely worth the try.
Their dessert of the day - a simple but delicious Mango &amp; Blueberry Tart! A great way to end a meal after having barbecue :)
In between the light brioche bun, there were shreds of pulled pork that melts in your mouth, delicious chipotle mayonnaise, and coleslaw. Burgers in general tend to be on the ‘heavy’ side due to having a huge chunk of meat but for this burger, the balance in portion for all the ingredients were spot on. Yum! For a full review, please visit eatsleepliverepeat.com
Delicious beef marmalade on toast with pickles. Our waiter suggested us to start off with this dish and he assured that if we did not like it, he will offer a replacement dish. And indeed it was yummy! 
The 10-hour pulled pork shoulder is so tender and juicy, it comes with a hint of smokey-ness.
$26/100g. We ordered 200g and it was a typical portion ordered for two (after we filled ourselves up with a lot of other food). Best tasting steaks ever. It was really soft and flavorful. You really don\'t need that much chewing power, lol. I would just say it just melts in your mouth but it sounds weird for steaks. Really worth the shot. Best dish of the dinner. I think this is what put Burnt Ends to world class. And the price is cheap for the quality. Totally worth every penny.  Awesome experience. You need to wait 45\' for it to cook though so better order it first hand. Need to do reservations in advance at the place too. We came in on Tuesday night with no reservations so we had to sit facing the wall.  By 8pm the place was packed! 
$20. It was alright. Not very impressive. A bit on the expensive side for the burger. Still tastes good but I don\'t think it\'s worth the price. Quite filling though. 
$12. Not worth it. It\'s just a bun with some flavorful onion and small meet chunks in there. It was okay. Really nothing too interesting though. 
$14. So very flavorful and tasty. Best appetizer I have ever had to date. The portion was small, probably 2/3 of your palm per piece but it\'s worth the price in my opinion. 
Comes in a seductive deep red, this onglet ($26/100g) was a piece of meat you should never resist. It boasts a melt-in-the-mouth texture and gives off a strong strong beefy flavour, it will definitely appeal to the carnivore within you. And don\'t worry about it looking so \'rare\', the meat is properly cooked and there was no blood on the plate as I sank my fork into it. \n<br />One thing though, some parts of the onglet was overly salted. 
Spent last night watching a talented pool of chefs working in their playground as I savoured the sophisticated dishes they prepared. Burnt Ends\' open kitchen truly brings its patrons into the culinary world, which is made up of insane culinary skills, out-of-this-world speed and accuracy and an interesting hierarchy. This exhilarating experience watching young cooks fervently slice the vegetables/ grill the meat was like watching Master Chef in real life and got me so intrigued, amused and delighted all at the same time. 
 Pork is probably one of my least favourite protein, (no) thanks to its inherent porky smell. And after having so many versions of pulled pork burger, I was honestly expecting something a little too sweet/ too smelly... This one is perfect. I loved how the smoky char covers the pork smell, and how that long hours of cooking makes the meat so tender and soft. Top it up with a garden full of vegetables, pickles, sharp cheddar cheese and the oh-so-soft brioche buns, it\'s a huge and satisfying burger. The Sanger is priced at $20, pretty affordable for the amount of depth you get in something that could have easily been too over-the-top. 
Throwback to the day I had the privilege to dine there.
Beef marmalade. Served like bruschetta.. Soooooo flavourful and the sweet of caramelised onions is so ooooommmm!!!!
You can\'t go wrong with this Beef Marmalade and pickles ($14) when you\'re here. Think housemade sourdough bread with the tender, flavorful beef and melting cheese, each bite was so enjoyable. The pickles and baby onions nicely balanced the flavor.
Very interesting dish!! The sweetness of the leek is oh la la.. SGD$45
|\n<br />Only seen at the premium Japanese Restaurants. Burnt Ends offered the similar experience of allowing the eaters to witness the processes of their dinner. .\n<br />|\n<br />One of their signature dish - Mayru Cube Roll. The chef will sliced and present us to the raw form of our dinner - Prefect marbled beef. Seared on their argentine grill and still remained medium in the inside. Only seasoned with rough sea salt so that we could experience the full impact of the beefy-ness. .\n<br />|\n<br />Definitely worth a second try! .\n<br />|\n<br />For the full course ⬇️\n<br />http://www.jiaknonstop.com/restaurant/burnt-ends-coolest-restaurant-ever
Expect an intimate yet casual meal at this 17-seater counter that\'s made the list of The World\'s 50 Best Restaurants (not to mention the top spot on Burpple’s Hot 100 in 2015), and watch as the chefs work with the massive dual cavity oven and elevation grills. The Burnt Ends Sanger ($20) reigns supreme, with smoky, juicy pork shoulder that\'s been cooked for 10 hours, topped with red cabbage slaw tossed in chipotle aioli, nestled between two fluffy, buttery brioche buns. Be sure to share this as you\'ll want to save space for other dishes. Another signature mainstay on the menu (it changes daily) is the Quail Eggs and Caviar ($15), it is simple yet complex. Steak-lovers, go straight for the Onglet ($26/100g) — a charcoal-grilled hanger steak charred to perfection and packs a punch of flavour with the accompanying burnt onions and bone marrow. Have as many desserts as your stomach can handle, but don\'t miss the perfectly balanced Pineapple, Rum and Vanilla featuring roasted pineapple, pistachios, French meringue, Tahitian vanilla ice cream, and dark rum glaze. For so much quality, the prices are certainly not steep here.
Been saving this place for a meal with the carnivorous boyfriend and I\'m so glad I can finally tick it off my list! It\'s just as good as I imagined and I can\'t wait for our next meal here again! 
 how do you tell if I think that a place is really good? well, you\'ll see me sitting outdoors in the sweltering heat having my meal instead of returning another time when they have seats for me indoors. \n<br />burnt ends is one of the rare few places where i\'ll willingly have my steak with sauce. i don\'t even like onions that much tbh but the burnt onion sauce is strangely addictive?! a slight smokey flavour followed by the sweetness of onions, never overpowering the natural flavour of the tender onglet steak that has been cooked to perfection. also, the lingering charred flavour that comes with each bite of the meat might serve as a gentle reminder of why the restaurant is called burnt ends. last but not least, the tiny pieces of melt in your mouth bone marrow which are taste even better on the bone marrow bun available as a separate order 😍
Not your typical bone marrow bun, the Burnt Ends version is on my list of sinful treats that one must definitely try. It tasted like a slightly more toasted version of the brioche bun from the sanger, generously smeared with garlic butter and bone marrow. I\'m not a fan of bone marrow by itself but this was a combination that left me wanting more. 
They do serve pretty affordable dish, for example their famed Pulled Pork Shoulder Burger! Booking 6 weeks in advance finally got us a try to eat the burger right here, and oh man I am hooked on it. Amazingly tender and juicy pork shoulder stuffed between the soft and fluffy brioche bun with the additional generous serving of coleslaw, cheese and chipotle aioli just made the whole burger deserves the well spent 20 bucks. No service charge and to see the chef processing all the food in front was such a delightful scene to see as well. Yummy! \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
No one really orders the BBQ fish here huh? So I went ahead to order this snapper any boy I made a good decision. I think it would be hard to find a  fish that tastes so uniquely flavourful anywhere else. The charred taste, combined with the sea salt and with whatever that is (I can\'t remember) on the side that tastes sour, is all intricately balanced. Not the star of the night, but definitely one of the top dishes to order. 
The signature dish of Burnt Ends, which everyone orders at this place. Juicy, tender, tangy flavour, which leaves you craving for more, and indeed, it left us ordering more than what we would have normally ordered. 
The Burnt Ends Sanger is essentially this: Two warm, toasty and fluffy brioche buns with a generous amount of cheese spread onto the top bun; a few pieces of pickled jalapenos interspersed with a heap of red cabbage slaw that was brimming with natural sweetness and crunch; and a slightly smoky, extremely tender, incredibly juicy 10-hour pulled pork shoulder.  Lending an extra oomph to the dish is a special tangy chipotle aioli that lovingly coats the coleslaw and pulled pork shoulder.                            \n<br />While Chef Andre Chiang of Andre owns Burnt Ends, the pricing of the food at Burnt Ends is very different from that of Andre. Burnt Ends is an Australian Barbecue restaurant helmed by Chef Dave Pynt that serves what I would term as high quality comfort food without the exorbitant price tag. Priced at $20 and available for both lunch and dinner, I think that the Burnt Ends Sanger is one of the most affordable indulgences one can have. \n<br />And if you ask me where the best pulled pork burger on our sunny little island is, this post would be my answer. Now that I have declared it as the best, there\'s this nagging feeling in me that someone, somewhere out there is going to disagree with me. It’s not so much about them having different tastes and preferences but simply because I haven’t tried every single pulled pork burger out there. So if you’re reading this and you have a differing opinion, please please do let me know where you think has the best pulled pork burger in Singapore. 🙏🏻
Pretty yummy. The burnt onions sauce, that tender medium rare beef... Yumz! 
Frozen block of palm sugar creme (something that resembles kulfi) with a pair of crisp sables and a large dollop of Mangoesteen sorbet. Rich, tart, textured, the kind of dessert with depth and character that speaks volumes on it own.. my kind!
These smashed potatoes cooked to perfection in lotsa fat, topped with a liquid center yolk then finished with Old Bay seasoning.@burntends_sg team pushing out their usual awesome! \n<br />#FTrecommends
First course at @burntends_sg and Will Goldfarb\'s @room4dessert_wg\'s dinner.Slice of smokey Kingfish, Spring Onions, Nori and Horseraddish. \n<br />I could have ten servings of these I\'d be really fulfilled on this rainy night, that being said, can\'t wait for the rest of the meal!\n<br />@jonathanleewe @junkielicious @r0x @bjornshen
Strong mix of flavours, with sweetness from maple unexpectedly dominating the combination. 
My favorite dish of the day! Unlike a toasted marshmallow, the outer shell is hard and sticky. There is a wonderful citrusy smell that greets you once you bite into the glazed layer. 
Very expensive! $15 per egg, ouch. But it\'s the signature dish so I couldn\'t pass it up. Egg is cold with a liquid centre that bursts into your mouth, mixing with the yummy caviar. 
Juicy and surprisingly fleshy. Meat was sweet but sauce was almost too rich -- perhaps fresh seafood deserves a simpler treatment. Nevertheless, was very yummy! 
Burnt Ends has been on my radar for a long while, and comes highly recommended. This tapas-style dish was tangy and smoky, with crumbled feta adding to the kick. 
If there is only one Pulled Pork Burger that I can consume in my life, it definitely has to be this. Gone are all those variants of Pulled Pork that uses BBQ sauce for the marinade; this one uses Chipotle Aioli which makes it so outstanding. Pull some pork off the burger, and you will find that the pork is moist yet fiborous, tasting pretty much of meat but the chipotle aioli tries to cut the gamey flavours at the right point with a moderate kick of spiciness. Coleslaw gives a refreshing touch with crunchy vegetables, and the buns are oh-so-fluffy and the top bun lined with cheese so neatly that it does not create a mess when it melted only on the bun surface. A really thoughtful burger, and one that is certainly hard to forget.
Despite the initial excitement of the Chicken Wings, this proved to be more gastronomic. Because it\'s meant to be a marmalade, you can\'t feel the beef in this one. All was left was a beef jam that puts all the bacon jams to shame; it tasted like a strong Kung-Po less the spiciness and went really well with the savoury cheese that lines the crisp and light toast. Pickles gave it any interesting twist in flavour giving it a sourish taste and a crunchy texture which makes it more dimensional.
Just a small part of the Chicken Wing, but still a thoughtful touch because each piece comes only with one bone, which also acts as a skewer that holds the meat together. It is firm, but did not miss out on being tender; the result being a texture really similar to frog meat that is covered in the same savoury-sweet glaze familiar with Unagi sushi. Pretty innovative and good for a light bite over some booze.
Wow. This slab was cooked to perfection. The restaurant is compact yet cosy, and reservations are highly recommended. I\'m definitely coming back for more. 
The exterior is charred by the woodfire but the meat remains tender and juicy. I fancied the watercress as well as it brought a gentle balance to the dish \n<br />#burpple #ketohloh #8DAYSEat
The yolk has a sweet aftertaste that complements the savoury caviar. However, $15 for this is indeed pricey\n<br />#burpple #ketohloh #8DAYSEat
Every bite of the colesaw and meat seem to have a different flavour and is hugely satisfying. There are many interesting items on the menu. Skip the entrees and go straight to the small plates and mains\n<br />#burpple #ketohloh #8DAYSEat
Burnt Ends is famous for their pulled pork burger and sharing plates, but they do steaks equally well. The Onglet ($26/100g) is a very well executed piece of charcoal-grilled hanger steak – charred to perfection, wonderfully tender and packs a punch of flavour along with the accompanying beef jus. The Rump Cap is excellent as well: cooked flawlessly and served with burnt onion sauce and and bone marrow. Also great is the Mayura Cube Roll ($60/100g), that as Tastemaker Veronica Phua puts it, is \"buttery to the nth degree\" and \"expertly grilled with nothing but a sprinkle of sea salt – the epitome of a perfect steak\".
Very tender Rump Cap cooked to perfection to how we requested in medium rare. A juicy and full of flavor cut that will melt in your mouth! Served with burnt onion sauce and generously covered with bone marrow which adds flavor to the meat. This is superb!
Marron, Tobiko and Kombo Beurre Blanc (SGD $90 each) - One of our favorite dish of yesterday night dinner at Burnt Ends. The distinctive natural sweetness flavor of the marron makes excellent eating, very similar taste to lobster. The taste and texture of marron is so marvelous when topped with tobiko and kombo beurre blanc (white butter). Highly recommended!
Smoked Quail Egg and Cavier (SGD $15 each) - This appetizer surprised us with smoked quail egg yolks that literally bursts in your mouth and their delicate flavor complements caviar perfectly! Simple yet interesting!
My dinner was a blur of high after high of the most phenomenal dishes. Here are four of the \"lighter\" ones, clockwise from top left, that preceded the mains of seafood and heavier meats.\n<br />1) Fennel, orange and burrata ($16++): I am not a fan of fennel but this had me singing its praises. Grilling transformed the fennel to be a thing of sweetness, which worked magic with the citrus element and creamy cheese. \n<br />2) Sobrasada ($14++): A spicy cured pork sausage served with toasted sourdough that got my juices going.\n<br />3) White onions, raisins, rocket and grated hard cheese: An off-the-menu item that the chefs surprised me with. Love the mix of flavours in here too.\n<br />4) Squid, pico de gallo and cotija ($18++): A fab way to enjoy the slippery strips of fresh squid - served in a pool of blended fresh salsa embellished with crumbled Mexican cow\'s cheese and coriander.\n
Popped my \"Pickleback\" cherry with a shot of Monkey Shoulder whisky and a chaser of Burnt End\'s very own house-made spicy, salty pickle juice. Almost put hair on my chest too 😝
My unforgettable meal ended with four desserts that were served in a perfectly-timed sequence.\n<br />1) Mint &amp; Chocolate: Unlike other mint desserts I\'ve had that tasted like toothpaste, the mint in this wasn\'t overpowering but balanced with finesse with the chocolate elements.\n<br />2) Pineapple, Rum &amp; Vanilla: My favourite of the lot as it was the most refreshing. The sweetness of that roasted pineapple was pretty spectacular.\n<br />3) Berry Tart: Making quite an impression was the extraordinarily light pastry that practically disintegrated in my mouth. Berries were sweet too.\n<br />4) Banana &amp; Butterscotch: Served hot, the liquid chocolate-covered, thin and crispy battered coating was wonderful with the soft banana it encased but I was so stuffed with food by then I could only fit a nibble 😂😂

However, I only had a nibble because I was too stuffed with food by then 😂😂
After it\'d spent hours in the crazy high heat of the massive oven, the huge slab of Angus short ribs was taken out, coated lavishly in molasses, wrapped up in sheets of paper and shoved back into the oven. Why? So we could be presented with this black-as-pitch beauty. It\'s too fine for the human eye to see but there was actually a micro-millimetre of crisped caramelisation all over which shattered the moment our teeth made contact. As expected, the meat under all the sticky and syrupy-sweet molasses was gasp-worthy, fall-off-the-bone tender. 
Why leave roasted bone marrow lying in the bone when it can be scooped out and slathered into multiple slots of a warm sesame seed studded bun? Every bite of this combination--that cushiony soft bread and creamy, fatty, slightly gelatinous marrow--triggered audible moans of pleasure.
Buttery to the nth degree, my knife had the easiest job in the world slicing through my piece of Mayura Station Fullblood Wagyu. Expertly grilled with nothing but a sprinkle of sea salt, it was the epitome of a perfect steak.
Unlike lobsters that come from the sea, marrons are freshwater shellfish native to the Southwest region of Australia. This gives their sweet flesh a distinctive mildly muddy taste as compared to the brighter, clean sweetness of lobsters. Which makes it all the more impressive when you taste the results of a chef who clearly knows what he is doing.\n<br />Burnt Ends keeps the marrons alive till the time comes for them to become dinner. So mere minutes prior to what you see in my pic above, this was a feisty blue creature waving its claws in the air (sorry if I am freaking out the sensitive souls amongst you). Anyway, the bare-bones preparation style of grilling truly brought forth the character of the marron. Its firm succulence also paired well with the house-made kombu (a type of seaweed) butter.
This was so unreal, I had to have an encore helping because one just wasn\'t enough! The fantastically tender heart muscle dazzled with just the right amount of spiciness. A thoughtful counterpoint in flavours and textures arrived via the bed of creaminess with a dash of pesto that it rested on.
A little too briney for me personally but I am sure there are those of you for whom this would bring you to your knees. 
Quail eggs at their most elegant: Sexily smoked and dressed in caviar. So simple yet filled with such depth in flavour.
Hot roasted pineapple is always delicious. This was paired with a light vanilla ice cream &amp; crunchy pistachios. The nutty creamy tangy flavor definitely did work for me! But where is the rum?
Their signature burger that you can\'t leave without having! Pulled pork shoulder mixed generously with coleslaw, chipotle aioli sandwiched between a brioche bun. Loving the use of the pork shoulder which was so tender with some fats that melts in your mouth. Even my boyfriend who doesn\'t eat coleslaw couldn\'t stop raving about this burger! 
I\'ve grown to like leek recently &amp; couldn\'t be more happy to have this here! They roast it in their close to 600 degrees oven till the outer layer is completely charred! The outer layer is then removed, sliced up, drizzled with the sauce &amp; sprinkled with hazelnuts before arriving before us! The natural sweetness of leek was well complemented by the savory sauce &amp; crunchy nuts! 
I was simply blown away by this steak! I love their work of grill on it, where charcoal was used and the meat was carefully controlled by the chef in charge. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the meat was tender and full of the charred taste which I absolutely adore! A rather thick burnt onion sauce was used, but it did not overpower the meat but instead brought the taste profile to another level - so rich so good. Oh and this was the 220g portion which was comfortable for 2, but it was so yummy I wished I got 300/400g instead haha
3.5 munchies: While the kingfish was really fresh, the mango was unfortunately, too sour to eat it on its own and needed a little zest to make a great starter.
4 munchies: The pungency of the pollock roe could be smelt even before the dish landed on the table. It certainly did not disappoint with the creaminess, tad saltiness as well as richness of the fish. I also liked the chewy skin of the potatoes that gave the overall dish some texture, nutrients and fibre.
Pizza crust was great. As I don\'t take feta, I requested to switch to other cheese instead. I chose Burrata. They were a little too generous  with the hoisin sauce.
Tonight this place truly exhibited the worst customer service I have experienced in Singapore. Full report coming soon.
flavour wise: 🙌🙌. value wise: 🙋 .. even my grandmama can assemble this simplistic form of a dessert.
hence my one hand for it. personally, if ur ain\'t a beer eater, this place is probably a no go. none of de dishes were worth hyping about. ah well. some days are good. others are worth forgetting.
This is way too overrated. Not happy Jan! I m need something more satisfying…
amazing lunch experience watching these bad ass talented chefs prepare food in the open kitchen. I couldn\'t appreciate their signature smoked quail eggs, but I absolutely loved their charred leeks w browned butter and hazelnuts, great combination of flavours. And of course, their burnt ends classic pulled pork sanger. Each mouthful was a divine kick of aioli spice and melt in your mouth pork snuggled in a crisp soft brioche bun. Do not pass up on that fresh hot out of the oven fig tart sitting in front of you, it is as delicious and beautiful as it looks. 😋
Generous serving of coleslaw and pull pork clasped between 2 buns made right in front of you. Heightened anticipation for lunch. =)
Feeling hot and flustered and then emotional just watching the chef and his team creating dishes one after another... Precise beauty like an amazing opera in the kitchen. Did I say I\'m in love? #Burpple #foodporn #foodaffair #instafood #loveatfirstbite
Heavenly buttered crust. Fantastic blend of the fruits - neither overpowering the other. Topped with a light vanilla bean cream. Being a dessert person I have really high standards for desserts I have.. This is heavenly!!
If you haven\'t yet tried the Pulled Pork Sanger at Burnt Ends, you\'re missing out. Imagine this: Brioche bun. Cheese. Pickled jalapenos. Red cabbage slaw. Tangy chipotle aioli. Smoky, juicy, tender pork shoulder that\'s been cooked for 10 hours and lovingly pulled. Brioche bun (again). Sink your teeth into all that and you\'ll be catapulted to heaven with the combination of textures and flavours. Pure satisfaction. Beware, it can get pretty messy!
The combination was good and rich. I think the portion size is actually just right.
Baby lamb was tender and most importantly no gamey taste! Absolutely enjoyed it!
Brought me back momentarily to the days in Paris, where I fell in love with French cuisine and that\'s another post altogether. 😊 #burntends #burntendssg
The desserts at Burnt Ends never fail to tick all my boxes with sweetness, acidity and varying textures in perfect harmony. This one was just brilliant: fluffy meringue brûlée and buttery biscuits with blueberry sauce trickling all over, and smack in the middle of it, a jolt of citrusy lemon sorbet. And it\'s not just any ordinary lemon sorbet - this one has an unexpectedly thick texture as a result of the natural pectins that emerge from heating lemons in the oven. Don\'t you just love science-y food? 
The love of my life: pulled pork and coleslaw with spicy chipotle mayo packed between cheesy brioche buns. Could eat this every day. 
Let it flow. 
No need to tell you what\'s snuggled under that little pile of chopped almonds and beans, is there? 😋
Can\'t remember what the sauce was (I think it could be bearnaise), but that\'s secondary, really, when it\'s under that fine slab of grilled beef. Succulent and a little fatty and altogether just absolutely delish. 
Fennel and orange - classic Aussie combination made complex by roasting the fennel so the ends are burnt (my favourite bits!) and the usually sweet vegetable takes on a smoky flavour, while the citrusy orange juice cuts through with its acidic tang. The crunch of the greens are complemented in every bite by clouds of creamy buffalo mozzarella. 
This has been my favourite restaurant since my first visit here on a media tasting, and in the one year that has passed, I\'ve not found a restaurant in Singapore that has left a bigger impression on my palate. The menu is unpretentious, ingredients are of top quality, flavours are immaculately balanced, and the overall dining experience is one you can\'t find anywhere else. This is my first time back as a paying customer and I\'m beyond pleased that the food is still as remarkable and will keep me coming back. 
poor little piggy was only 8 inches tall 😱 skin was perfectly crackling, served unadorned &amp; accompanied only by sea salt for dipping. menu says it\'s a 2 pax portion but I think it is prob better for at least 3 pax due to the richness, and so that u can order other dishes without having a meat coma.
it\'s not rump but the picanha , \"considered one of the best (and most flavorful) beef cuts in many South American countries, particularly Brazil and Argentina\" (according to wiki). flavorful and perfectly done (like all decent steakhouses the default doneness is med rare). 
I\'m mad about courgettes. i\'m glad they keep it on the menu. semi crunchy nuggets of delight, drowned in a mild melted cheese with chives cream (?mashed green bed at the bottom)
a bit of an indulgent start but hey it\'s Friday. managed to grab the last two crappy seats without reservations at 6.25pm... 
Smoked quail eggs, leek with hazelnuts, capers &amp; brown butter sauce, a superb pork sanger (best eaten with hands), rump cap and butterscotch chocolates with peppercorn &amp; sea salt to top it all off. #burntends #grill #foodie
The delectable Duck Hearts after the scrumptious Rabbit Liver. #theaudone #foodporn
Friendly service, excellent food. Interesting ambience. Every dish was a delightful surprise. A thoroughly enjoyable dining experience all round. Thumbs-up! 
This restaurant is incredible, and this was the pièce de résistance... The beef is presented to you beforehand, so you can see the quality of it; you can often even see it being butchered right in front of you, as there are no tables (well, there is 1), but it is all counter service, most of it facing directly into the kitchen...you are pretty much nose-to-nose with the chefs, who are always happy for a bit of interaction,+to answer any questions you have. This is undoubtedly one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore, if not the world...I can\'t wait until they bring their food to London for a few days in January next year!
Oh yes, we lurve the Burnt Ends Sanger. 😀😀😀 Besides the awesome grub,  the pretty darn cute sous chef (extreme left) is just one more reason to visit Burnt Ends 😉 #burntends #sgfood #chefs #burger #omnomnom #getinmybelly #ilovemyjob
Pineapple, Rum and Vanilla. Roasted pineapple, pistachios, French meringue, Tahitian vanilla ice cream, pineapple tuile and dark rum glaze. There\'s sweetness, there\'s acidity, there\'s crunch, creaminess and chewiness - 10/10 in my books! #dessert #fruity #pineapple #vanilla #rum #meringue #sweet #sugarhigh #happyfood #yum #sgfood #burntends #foodporn #foodart #ilovemyjob #burpple
Burnt Ends Sanger. My absolute favourite dish here: Pork shoulder cooked in the oven for 10 hours, with home-pickled jalapeños, cheese, coleslaw and chipotle aioli between homemade buns. #burntends #pork #burger #meat #spicy #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
Salmon Skin and Roe. Lime zest, seaweed, ikura (salmon roe), and oyster emulsion on crispy salmon skin make for a top-notch balance of textures. #salmon #skin #roe #ikura #seaweed #crispy #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Dark chocolate macarons with wild hibiscus shells and a dusting of charcoal. 
Best dessert of the night: rum and vanilla ice cream on grilled pineapple and crowned with a shard of candied pineapple.
Smoked ice cream on wild hibiscus and ginger crumble. Interesting.
Banana and Caramel. Very simple, a little unmemorable, but a satisfying dessert nonetheless. 
Oh-so-tender beef with caramelised onion purée and side salad.
Picture does not do this crisp-skinned baby snapper with fennel justice. 
You know the bliss of sinking your teeth into a really good burger? This one is 100% satisfaction - toothsome pulled pork and crunchy slaw heavy doused in chipotle aioli (love the heat) and cushioned between plush brioche buns. 
Quail with rocket and aioli. Very moist and tender, but not quite my thing.
Sweet, juicy vine tomatoes and jamon on toast. Simple, rustic, and utterly delish. 
Chicken Liver Parfait. Love how the orange peel adds a a slight bitterness to cut through the richness. #parfait #chickenliver #burntends #sgfood #foodporn #sogood
I wish I could have cut into one of these gorgeous Smoked Quail Eggs to show you the oozy yolk within, but that\'d be denying myself the pleasure of having it pop in my mouth. #quaileggs #oozy #deceptivelooking #burntends #sgfood #sogood #oneofakind
Smoky oven roasted pineapple chunk, pineapple crisp and vanilla ice cream. Who woulda thought a meat and grill oriented restaurant would make such great desserts! $10
Amazing smoky, tender, juicy beef. Made even better by the rich and intense onion puree. $40
Pulled pork, coleslaw, chipotle aioli, brioche. Very tender pork, a good but otherwise unremarkable dish. $20
English fusion food done in \'Tepan-yaki\' style. Check out the huge oven furnace while sitting at the bar counter.
It was mind blowing and worth it !
Love this very much; besides their quail eggs with caviar 👍🏻 And this is cheaper than the quail eggs 😅 .\n<br />Awesome crispy flatbread with the lightest taramasalata.

Onglet ($26/100gm)\n<br />.\n<br />One of the best dinners I’ve had in a while. The ambience and seating was perfect, right in the middle of the counter where food gets checked and plated before getting served.\n<br />.\n<br />First time trying @burntends_sg ‘s much raved about onglet. Preordered just in case! 195gm of perfectly cooked steak that looked so lean but tasted so tender and juicy. Served with that burnt onion and bone marrow sauce, omg richness level maxed! This is by far my favourite dish for the evening!
Leek ($16)\n<br />.\n<br />This otherwise seemingly uninteresting dish on @burntends_sg ‘s menu came strongly recommended so we added this midway pronto! Yet another sensational dish. The leak is first cooked in their charcoal oven till completely burnt on the outside but wow, once peeled open, you get this really moist and soft leek drizzled generously with brown butter sauce and topped with roasted hazelnuts. Everything was perfect and I loved the crunch and aroma of those hazelnuts.
Amazing stuff.

not to mention the chefs too 😉
This is the epitome of the perfect steak, definitely one of the best I\'ve ever had and the most expensive at $50+/100g
420g of onglet for the boys..I\'d usually go for medium rare but today we went medium instead and definitely no regrets there
The texture felt like fats, a chewier version of foie gras

The taste and flavor of the food justifies the aesthetics on the photo...the perfect reason that landed Burnt Ends and Chef Dave Pynt its 10th spot in the 2017 Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants and the Chef\'s Choice Award at last night\'s awarding ceremony  in Bangkok.

It\'s still good as I remember it from my last visit (not that it\'s a long time ago). I think I\'m going to order another one for delivery.

I\'m hoping that this gets its way into the menu soon so I could order and have more.  So good! If my friend wasn\'t looking, I probably would\'ve eaten his share too!

The beef is tender, sauce sinfully thick and oozing with complexity in flavor. I like how the Pickles balance out the sweetness of the meat and cuts through the fat. I don\'t mind having his often. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Burnt Ends, Singapore\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodie #mychefstable #foodporn #sgfoodie #beef #pinoyfoodie #leica #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #feedfeed #goodeats #pickles #buzzfeast #food #sogood #delicious #foodcoma #foodgram #forkyeah #foodphotography #meaty #dinner #instagram #burpple #asias50best #foodlover #indulge
Though I\'m not a fan of duck hearts but with Chef preparing it, I\'ll gladly order again and savor every morsel of it.  I\'ll surely ask for a little extra sauce to slather onto the meat coz I love the sauce...a lot.  Who cares if there\'s fat in it.  I\'ll just do a 5k run the following day. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Burnt Ends, Singapore\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodie #singaporefood #foodporn #sgfoodie #skewers #pinoyfoodie #leica #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #feedfeed #goodeats #duck #buzzfeast #food #grilled #delicious #foodcoma #foodgram #forkyeah #foodphotography #periperi #dinner #instagram #burpple #asias50best #foodlover #indulge
One of my go to places in Singapore is Burnt Ends because they are consistent and meticulous in delivering good tasting and properly cooked food as shown in this Sweetcorn, Seaweed and Uni Salad. Good luck Chef Dave Pynt on the upcoming Asia\'s 50 Best awarding ceremony.

One of their classics, a renowned menu item that you can even get on @ubereats_sg is made from pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw and chipotle aioli sandwiched between a brioche bun.

Rump Cap Burnt Onion &amp; Bone Marrow ($26 per 100g)
Beef Marmalade with Pickles ($14+)
Pulled Pork Shoulder, Cole Slaw, Chipotle Aioli, Brioche Bun
If only I can achieve the same feat during BBQs then I need not pay $2 for a single piece.

Expectations were high and anticipation was at near breaking point. The months of waiting for all well worth it as this was truly a heart stopping moment. Till today, I am still in awe at how good this dish was. The cohesiveness of flavours from the beef marmalade and something that I don\'t even like eating previously, pickles, was just magnificent. The toasted bread was like a ship, tasked in transporting these awesomeness into my mouth.\n<br />•\n<br />Burnt Ends\n<br />Address: 20, Teck Lim Road, Singapore 088391 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #restaurantsg #burntendssg #asia50best #worlds50best
Smoked Ice Cream &amp; Sugar Cake ($12+)
I cannot handle this King Crab in Garlic Brown Butter ($75+). This was AMAZEBALLS. So tender. So juicy. I have sweet dreams about it.
Was urged by Burpple Tastemaker Felicia to try their roasted marshmallows ($2 a pop) and I sure didn\'t expect it to come with a show! Probably my idea of roasted is too tame, Chef David Pynt was flaming the entire marshmallow, which turned into a spectacular ball of fire 🔥!!! Sorry for the blurred image, this is a screengrab from my snapchat 😂 Too excited filming it, I forgot to grab a photo with my camera.

I was really disappointed by this burger from Burnt Ends! It was SO SALTY - I literally tasted nothing but saltiness. It was so salty that my lips were burning at the end of my meal. It was that bad. Really disappointed because I was so excited for this burger from all the great reviews.

Burnt marshmallows! Coated with a lemon sugar, so when flambé, it gives the marshmallow a sugar crust while keeping the integrity of the marshmallow real. A great way to end off an excellent experience. #dessert #marshmellow #marshmellows @burntends_sg #burntends #burntendssg #dinner #birthday #reservation
The steak cooked to absolute perfection that melts in your mouth. The burnt onion sauce (Onions are burnt on the grill on both sides, just charred enough to retain its sweetness. This requires a lot of skill, patience and finesse) compliments the steak so well! Topped with luscious bone marrow, it\'s everything I have grown to appreciate from @burntends_sg It\'s an absolute treat for the senses. @burntends_sg #burntends #burntendssg #dinner #birthday #reservation

The Sugar Cake was crunchy in the outside and soft and butter on the inside.  The best part is the Smoked Ice Cream. Such a good twist to the usual vanilla ice cream. So glad I ordered this one.

Soft Brioche Bun, with Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, topped with a Slaw and drizzled with Chipotle Aioli and finished with a few pieces of Pickled Jalapeño slices.

Every mouthful of the meal was a delightful experience as we helped ourselves to the Farmer\'s Salad, sourdough, warmed oysters, white pepper chicken neck, onglet with burnt onions and bone marrow, Burnt Ends\' Sanger, berry tart, burnt marshmallow, and some white wine. Wana be back again, soon!
It\'s made of Roasted Onions, a hint of Maple and Toasted Almonds with a generous saving of cheese.  Simple things prepared with passion, creates a wonderful products.

No, it\'s not a baby Ong haha. It is actually synonymous for hanger steak which is a cut \"prized for its flavour\" (thanks wiki). Very tasty⭐️

Anything brioche, I falter. Love everything about this! So succulent, so indulgent (left me without any sluggish feelings like after a fully loaded burger) 10/10 will eat again 🍔
Buttered buns, slaw, copious amounts of cheese to cause a cheese coma, and that 10 hour pulled pork. I rest my case, friday tis indeed my favouritest day of the week all thanks to @ubereats!  #burntendssg #ubereatssg #burpple #foodpornsg

Will come back for this
Orange cinnamon marshmallow roasted to a crrrrisssp with an incredibly fluffy, velvety, melty sweet goo inside and a caramel-y skin that sticks to your teeth. We ordered 2, and one of them left an almost unbearable bitter aftertaste. Too much fire?

The orange burst was a pleasant jolt on the tastebuds that came after biting through the crusty caramel \"chao-tah\" shell. Didn\'t matter that the gooey marshmallow stuck to the molar pits. Literally marks a good \'burnt\' end of the dinner.
Repost Burnt Ends because it\'s heavenly good. 
The smokey char on that perfectly cooked meat, with silky rich meaty flavors of the bone marrow makes for a perfect combination of taste. \n<br />#burntends #burntendssg #burpple
For our main course, we ordered their Onglet – a prized cut of beef that is obtained from the diaphragm of a steer. Upon ordering their steak, they brought out a piece of 180g onglet and asked if we were happy with the portion. One thing to note here is they did not ask what temperature we would like our beef to be cooked. They simply cooked the hanger steak to the best temperature in order to obtain the absolute best flavour out of the beef – a perfect rare. After being barbecued in their apple and almond wood smoked oven for 40 minutes, we were served with a very flavourful hanger steak with burnt onions and bone marrow. The cook throughout the steak was surprisingly very consistent. Every bite was so incredibly appetizing, I didn’t want this dish to end. They really did justice to this piece of beef.

The beef is really good!!! 
Much anticipated, @burntends_sg didn\'t disappoint. We could have ordered another round of the #beefmarmaladeandpickles #perfection. Love that most of the meaty dishes can be ordered by the 100g portion meaning even 2 people can #shareplates and have variety. Intimate space, good service e.g. We were warned of the 45min wait for the #rumpcap #delicious #singaporefood #singapore #sgfood #burntends #burntendssg #burpple
Madame @r0x has crowned this \"Best dessert she\'s had for as long as she has lived\". Stole another lady\'s heart, way to go Will Goldfarb @room4dessert_wg!
One is that it uses really nice, succulent and sweet Fraise de Bois (from Spain), then the yogurt is not very sweet and it\'s accentuated with ash meringue. Dig in!! Burnt Ends, Singapore
One of those chefs is Chef Dave Pynt. He has developed a good following after word spread around town that he cooks well. \n<br />The rump cap is cooked till just a perfect medium then served with a watercress salad and a burnt onion purée. The best part is the bone marrow that is placed on top of the meat. Totally sinful but hits the satiety center just right. \n<br />Burnt Ends, Singapore
Perfectly roasted tomatoes till the natural sugars are caramelised slightly, imparting a good balance of sweet, sour and umami. The roasted tomatoes are arranged on top of slightly toasted house made sourdough bread slathered with pesto then drizzled with a little balsamic. Yum! \n<br />Burnt Ends by Chef Dave Pynt, Singapore
I misheard my friend and consequently missed out on having Wagyu at Burnt Ends -- huge regret. But the onglet was good: meat itself was flavorful, charred on the outside while juicy on the inside. Accompanying salad was also very tasty!
When first pulled out of the fire, the leek is unrecognisable. Then, knowing hands enter frame and briskly strip off the outer charred blackness revealing a gleaming and moist centre that\'s unbelievably sweet and juicy. Upping the stakes in gastronomic ecstasy is what comes next. After being cut into big sections, the leek is covered in ultra-fragrant melted brown butter, smashed capers and toasted whole hazelnuts. Honestly, my first bite of this left me speechless. \n<br />#BurntEnds #asias50bestrestaurants #leeksnevertastedsogood #sgfood #sgeats #instafoodsg #burpple #burppletastemaker
The luscious shredded meats was elevated by simply adding the crunch of the coleslaw and the tang of chipotle aioli sauce on it and it came out so incredibly good!

This triangular muscle of the cow makes such a good meaty starter! 
This roasted marshmallow does look \"poisonous\" with its completely black exterior. Glazed with orange &amp; cinnamon, this was a gooey creamy awesome pop into the mouth! 
With caviar looking oh-so-fine~
Don\'t think twice, take it!
Love the sauce so much. Burnt to perfection. 
Excellent sauce, best pulled pork burger in Singapore. 
What a pizza party!!! Whoohoo!!
Looking through my Lightroom catalogue on the train and found this shot. Mmmm… definitely not worth the price paid. But delicious 😊 #EleGlutton #BurntEnds #QuailEggs #Burpple #CoffeeAndCravings
$2. The perfect burnt ending. #dessert #sg #restaurant #cuisine
Grill to perfection!
Absolutely speechless!! Amazing doesn\'t even describe it. It\'s fantastically messy!!! If you don\'t fall in love after first bite I don\'t know if you ever truly love a burger. #Burpple #foodporn #foodaffair #instafood #burger #loveatfirstbite
With the distinct taste of iron that a solid piece of medium-rare steak should have, and lots of beef jus to pump up the meaty flavour. Waiter advised us to go for 350g (for two pax), but I\'m glad we stuck to a 175g serving because that\'s really good enough (amongst other dishes) for 2-3 people. 
mm super delish. so far so good. #foodporn #foodgasm #dinner #lamb #meat #foodie #delish

Smoked Quail Eggs. Instant foodgasm. #quaileggs #eggs #molten #yolk #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Smoked Quail Eggs. Still one of my favourites, with firm whites singed with smokey flavour, and oozy yolks. #quaileggs #eggs #molten #yolk #smokey #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
The original taste n fragrance of the fennel remain, or should I say enhanced, with no overpowering dressing or flavoring. 👍👍
still thinking about this bruschetta #latergram #foodporn #foodie #nom #nomstagram
too many bones!
in a word, gorgeous. 
The start to yet another great meal. #cherish  #instafood
Financiers with orange peel in the middle - love the crusty outsides that cradle springy, moist crumbs within.
Crackly salmon skin slathered with oyster emulsion and ikura (salmon roe). Some may find this fishy, but the various textures are amazing together. #salmonskin #ikura #aioli #sgfood #foodporn #burntends #sogood
Warmed Oyster. I think I\'m actually beginning to enjoy this shellfish. In other words, this is life-changing. #fresh #oyster #shellfish #burntends #sgfood #aphrodisiac #foodporn #sogood
Awesome! Squid that melts in your mouth. 
Pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw, chipotle aioli, brioche bun. $20
