I have drunk 6 of this sweet Thai Milk Tea tonight, wonder why it is so addictive. When I fall asleep tonight, I am sure I\'ll have \'sweet\' dreams. If only I am sleeping on the \'Heavenly Bed\' tonight. üòÄ
Great buns too, sturdy and crusty on the outside, and fluffy and soft on the inside...the perfect recipe to hold everything together. Flawless, but not quite. Only because this is called the hawker burger. The braised pork belly and char siew ‚Äî its red tinge especially ‚Äî were a disappointment. Both were a little dry and felt as though they were sitting for awhile before they were served. The sambal mayonnaise, on the other hand, was fabulous. The shoestring fries, while fried to crisp perfection, was a tad passable. Ok, that\'s all.
The spread at Seasonal Taste dinner buffet is definitely awesome! Went for the seafood indulgence night which serves a variety of fresh plump succulent seafood esp their juicy creamy oyster is a must try! They too have a carving counter, noodle cooking counter and not forgetting a selection of pretty colorful orgasamic desserts awaiting. Enjoy the buffet with a panoramic view of CBD skyscrapers and PSA port of Singapore.
Laksa - the gravy is full-flavoured and well balanced, with just the right level of spiciness and the crunchy cucumber and bean sprouts cut the oiliness.
The Braised Beef Noodle Soup will be prepared a la minute at the ‚Äòlive‚Äô station.
Here are some of the highlights from TASTY TAIWAN at Seasonal Tastes. @TheWestinSingapore

Just joking la. Anyway these are just some of the dishes that are available at Seasonal Tastes CNY Buffet Line.
If you prefer something more Western and French, Pastry Chef Florent Castagnos‚Äô creation such as Red Velvet Cake, Strawberry Mousse Cake, Orange Konnyaku Jelly and Raspberry.
The highlights got me excited enough ‚Äì Mini Buddha Jump Over The Wall, ‚ÄòLive‚Äô dim sum and Cantonese-style BBQ stations, Crispy Red Snapper with creamy salted egg yolk sauce, Braised Pork Belly, Taro, Golden Pumpkin Pot, Sea Salt Baked Sakura Chicken with wood fungus, wild mushrooms and TRUFFLE oil.
Give me some soup to ease that irritating rascal pls. Best if it is a bowl of double-boiled fish maw and crab meat broth with abalone, fish maw, mushroom, chicken and Chinese cabbage (aka Mini Buddha Jump Over The Wall) from Seasonal Tastes\' Lunar New Year Feasting Menu. Super shiok!!!üòãüòãüòã Lunar New Year‚Äôs Eve | 7 February 2016\n<br />Dinner Buffet: Adult $108++*, Child (aged 4 ‚Äì 12 years old) $54++*\n<br />*inclusive of free-flow of soft drinks and juices\n<br />Lunar New Year | 8 ‚Äì 22 February 2016\n<br />Lunch Buffet: Adult $55++, Child (aged 4 ‚Äì 12 years old) $27.50++\n<br />Dinner Buffet: Adult $75++, Child (aged 4 ‚Äì 12 years old) $37.50++
Okay, okay‚Ä¶ honestly, this phone camera rocks (surprisingly). The photos turned out to be clear, has a ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô look and good with close-ups. Tried shooting small fruits such as the raspberries, and photos are sharp.

This is from the Seasonal Tastes Christmas Buffet, which includes festive mainstays such as Apple Honey-glazed Turkey and Pineapple-glazed Ham, to Chestnut Stuffing, Port Reduction, Spiced Pumpkin Pie, Homemade Sausages and House-made Terrines.
This is part 1 of the seafood high at the Lobby Lounge of the Westin. Every bits of this plate is tasty. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 September 21
Chef was confident enough to say his was one of the best, said to be inspired by both Singapore and Malaysian versions. True enough, the gravy hovered somewhere in the middle ‚Äì not overly rich, slight coconuty aroma, and base which was flavourful while being light.
Fresh selection of lobster, crabs, oyster among other local delights like sambal stingray too! #seasonaltastesSG #westinsg
Not to be missed is the \'live\' shellfish station where chefs can whip up your choice of seafood (fish, mussels, clams, prawns and calamari etc) aÃÄ la minute, in any style (fried, steamed or sauteÃÅed).
A to go place on Friday nights for buffet lovers. Friday is seasonal tastes\' seafood dinner, serving up fresh oysters, clams, crayfish, prawns together with an international selection of cuisines. Their seafood is ridiculously fresh and sweet, bringing the freshness of seafood standard to a whole new level. For buffet eaters who love the seafood section the most, this place is a DEFINITE to go. To finish up your meal, this buffet pale offers a relatively wide range of desserts but the best is definitely their ice cream and sorbet section. Their avocado and coconut ice cream is extremely creamy and delectable. The also have a lime sorbet which helps you to cleanse your palette after a heavy dinner. Prices for the seafood dinner on Friday nights is at$79++.
Overall lunch not much selection and no wow items üò¨ best lunch buffet still Edge (Pan Pacific) &amp; Four Seasons to me. Grand Hyatt not bad too
A set of this for $45 includes sandwiches, scone, chocolate eclair and tarts. Located on the 32nd floor the view is magnificent and it is really quiet, great for chilling over high tea. Timing for high tea is 2.30-5pm and a set is $45. 
No surprises but I\'m always starting with the dessert table üòÜ #TheBrunchBeats #WestinSG #SeasonalTastes
Another dessert to try is their avocado gelato! // Part of #TheBrunchBeats brunch at #SeasonalTastes that teams sexy DJ beats with a wondrous view. $158/adult
Oh look! It\'s a Green Chocolate Fountain! Think free flow of green tea kit kat! Wife and I are seldom attracted to choc fountains, but this one we are!

This is a dish that I have not seen before. The thicken soup is hearty and comforting. The starchy soup reminds me of the Taiwanese Geng, soup thicken with starch. A popular street food in Taiwan.
Back then chicken was considered expensive, hence the local created the dish using minced pork in lieu of chicken thigh.
