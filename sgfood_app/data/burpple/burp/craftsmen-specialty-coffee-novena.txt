Overall 🍔 consists of beef patty and mesclun salad which is enhanced by Sriracha sauce that adds a strong spicy peppery flavor. The white wine spaghetti is drizzled with fresh chopped parsley, cherry tomatoes, chili flakes, Parmesan cheese and decent amount of prawns. Satisfied me and happy Thursday!
so good! salted caramel ice cream on top of a super crispy &amp; fluffy waffle, drizzled with gula melaka &amp; coconut shavings, topped with strawberries &amp; blueberries 😍😋
They must have been really good then. Sans the scramble; bacon and some form of hollandaise, this waffle was of good material. Will go back to try the 7-spiced chai and that elusive french bread.
Freshy fried churros [S$9.90] in old school vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce Craftsmen Specialty Coffee on 173 Thomson Road, Singapore. Opposite United Square Shopping Mall. Food wise average, however, their coffee is a redeeming factor. 
Awesomely creamy egg scramble with lightly fluffy waffle that is crispy on the outside! Bacon slightly salty but that\'s preserved meat for you... 
Craftsmen has become one of my favorite hideouts with my current favorite brunch item - 3 Tier Brioche.
What can be breakfast, brunch and dessert all at the same time? For the love of... Waffles!
Still crispy even though the fries were coated with the rich savoury salted egg yolk batter. A great plate to share since finishing this alone is too sinful! 😛
Simple but good hehe :-) portion was smaller than expected but just enough to satisfy breakfast cravings! thought my sour dough toast could be thicker and eggs needed a little more flavour but they were sooo creamy it makes up for everything :-))))) coffee was alright mm lacked the acidity that I prefer 
Smoked salmon and eggs sandwiched in tasty good bagels lined with cream cheese. A good eat for weekend breakfast. #burpple
NEW branch open at Thomson Road! had the Pulled Pork Sourdough ($17.90) and accompanied it with a Butterscotch Latte ($6). the cafe allowed lots of light to enter with the open concept. not the best pulled pork because it was a little dry when eaten alone, but it was alright with the help of the eggs on top. more sauce should be added to the pulled pork to give it more flavour and make it more moist! the latte was more on the sweet side, though i couldn\'t taste any distinct flavour of butterscotch. however, the wide range of flavoured lattes was interesting!
Newly opened outlet for the popular coffee chain. Coffee is at its usual high quality and its laid back decor provides the perfect place to catch up with friends and families over a delicious weekend brunch.
Loads of options for both beverages and food is what sets Craftsman apart from the rest of your regular cafe. With quick service on a busy Saturday morning they earn brownie points. A little on the steeper side when it comes to cost but completely worth it.
Oh well. \n<br />I thought that some cafes which are already strong in what they are doing, shouldn\'t go into something they are not so confident about.
Came to check out the newest Craftsmen Specialty Coffee outlet. Chill environment, nice iced espresso latte… till the music took a change in tune… the first few notes of Eric Clapton\'s Wonderful Tonight got me gasping and swooning… one of those times when classics you haven\'t heard in awhile takes you by surprise at the right time. Followed by Tears In Heaven… if they keep up this playlist, this may become my favourite place to hang out and \"workhard anywhere\".
A good breakfast option if you are looking for something light to start the day. Two toasted English muffins spread with salsa, avocado and coriander, with poached eggs on the top and paprika sprinkled over and pepper cracked over the top. An interesting play of flavours where you get a tangy flavour with a buttery, smooth touch from the avocado. One of the poached eggs was fine, but the other just didn\'t flow and had a yolk that was almost turning solid. But apart from that, this is a great option to have if a breakfast platter just seems too heavy for you.
Using a custom blend that they have developed in collaboration with Liberty Coffee, the Flat White here is smooth, roasty with an earthy body. Soothing, yet verging nearer to the stronger side that is comforting for a perk-me-up.
Disappointed with this dish as there\'s no enough seasoning on the scrambled eggs and the sourdough was too tough. \n<br />#brunch#scrambledegg#ndweats#singapore#burpple#foodie#sgeats#sgcafe#singapore#healthy

Thank you @craftsmenspecialtycoffee for your amazing coffee. Still fighting the addiction.\n<br />BTW did I mention how bad my caffeine rush was yesterday? For someone who used to be a barista, I assumed I had gained an immunity against caffeine rushes. My fingers were trembling and my heart was racing for hours. Not the best state to be at work, especially when you\'re jittery while marking compositions.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#throwback #throw🔙 #paragon #orchardroad #craftsmenspecialtycoffee #superito #coffeehunting #coffeeaddicts #coffee #coffeegram #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodspotting #instafood #instagood #instagramers #yummy #amazing #iphonesia #picoftheday #photooftheday #igdaily #burpple  #caffeineaddicts #caffeineheads #cafesg #新加坡 #싱가폴

Absolutely loving the creamy scrambled eggs and spicy special sauce 😍
😍
I personally prefer skinnier fries but this slightly thicker fries was still delicious! 😍 loved the caramelised onions and relish was delicious. Will be back to try the other dishes. Love their all day breakfast menu
More for sweet-lovers.

Boy loves their flakey croissant which he almost finished the whole piece by himself. We shall drop by again for the salted egg one which we missed today 😁. #cuisineparadiseeatout #sgcafe #croissant #latteart#burrple
=D \n<br />The food is great, especially love the unknown mustard-like sauce on the brioche haha. Definitely will be back, maybe to their other locations next time instead.\n<br />#burpple
Hearty portion of Craftsmen Supreme(with an add-on of the Signature Sauce) served here that can be shared with another person, if you are not very hungry.

Their curry-esque signature sauce has so much vampish allure I actually parted ways with $3 just for some (it only comes with selected items).
