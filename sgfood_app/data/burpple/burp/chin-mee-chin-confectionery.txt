Brekkie at #ChinMeeChin with @vanschua and @rockabelity. I love the crunchy charcoal-toasted bread of Ya Kun, but the soft sweet bun from the old-school Chin Mee Chin is equally awesome in a different way - a pillowy soft with a melted buttery centre way. Breakkkfasssttt #ilovekayatoast Also try their custard tarts. Shiok sia. The custard is more jelly than custard actually. A little translucent, it\'s like biting into a custard-flavoured firm agar agar jelly. Any place that uses marble tables and has a auntie who whips a mean cup of Teh-O is üëçüèº in my book!
Just a simple kaya bun - not toast - but so so satisfying and delicious. The buns were your average HDB bakery buns, nothing fancy, but was surprisingly stellar in its simplicity. They were well toasted, boasting beautiful grill marks, yet soft and immensely fluffy. Enjoyed with the rich kaya and a cube of butter - ahhhhhhh.
A few hiccups along the way during our visit as Aunty forgotten our toast order and we waiting quite a while. When it arrive, there\'s only one bun instead of two and had to reorder. By the time we started eating, those who came in with us had left.
Kaya taste eggy and it goes well with the soft and lightly toasted bun.
First, eat the kaya toast. Hmmmm.. The taste of kaya so light with the eggy fragrance. Next take the one with kaya butter, trust me. You feel complete, you will.
Been eating these chocolate muffins/cupcakes since I was a kid. Now they\'ve increased the price and the standard has dropped but I\'ll still come by here cos it\'s just special to me. 
Food was average, but the service was terrible. Nobody bothers to serve you, people who came later gets served first. Never going back again 
This place doesn\'t need our recommendation, what with its history, and enthusiastic word of mouth doing it for them. There\'s no better place to head down in your shorts and slippers with a few good friends and have a comforting breakfast of kaya toast (extra butter, pls) and kopi siu dai. The toast here comes in the form of traditional buns that are served open-faced, smeared with kaya and topped with a small pat of cold butter. Sometimes nothing beats tradition.
Loved their eggs! I thought their kaya toasts were pretty normal, but the egg tarts has a special texture to it üòã pretty place for pictures tooüëÜüèª!
Last wk i was there with @carl_holmberg.  The Confectionary is filled with crowd we gotta for abt 45 min. So we decided to try 1 of each pastaries. To my surprise the egg tarts is supergood. I have been deceived time by numerous Normal tasty-looking egg tarts which i have. The Tarts Base Crumb is Thicker than the normal. One thing also surprise me is the filling when i ate the tarts simply melt into my mouths. The Custard Puff is good to many ppl they say it look normal go there try if u all want. @john.liam @candice.huang @debbiehuang @rachelziyi @mademoiselle.melo @kenn_evans these pastaries are really awesome gotta bring u all go there.

One of the most traditional places to have Singapore treats for breakfast, Chin Mee Chin Confectionery has been here for over 80 years.
Familiar, comforting, authentically old school local breakfast with the family today. While the food was good, I loved the 60s in-store ambience even more. 
Breakfast was an overkill for 2 with @grace. Very old school Kaya and butter toast, was different from the usual. Soft with a sinful slab of butter hehe. Was hoping it\'d be crispy on the sides. (Also, we were like IS THIS BURGER BUNS?!) Egg tart was yummy with fragrant crust but a little too sweet. We weren\'t a fan of the custard puff. Glad we didn\'t have to wait for seats! Also, the auntie told us not to take photos and put online cos they\'re busy as it is. (Sorry). Heard it\'s usually really crowded so go only if you don\'t mind the wait. 
Super old school, but overrated leh? And the auntie wasn\'t very nice üòí
Breakfasts don\'t get any more quintessentially Singaporean than this - fluffy kaya toast buns topped with generously-sized pads of butter, flaky, eggy, custard tarts and the wobbliest half-boiled eggs. Possibly the best way to kick off the summer holidays üéâ
Highlight of the breakfast was their toasts which were so well made that all the kaya, sugar and butter came together as one. Tea and eggs were up to standard and we were lucky to get a seat without waiting! Do give it a try if you are awake at 8am on a Sunday! 
The egg tarts are too sweet for my liking. I like egg tarts that have more \"egg\" taste. The crust was good, it does not fall apart too easily and it was crisp. The custard bun was alright. Not something I will come back for. 
I know this place because i used to have tuition nearby around the Area very long time ago when i was abt Pri 3 to Pri 4 . When i was very young my parents will always bring me go there to have a tea time before i start my tuition &amp; They will buy back home their homemade kaya. Let me tell u the kaya is homemade by an old uncle i can say the kaya contain no preservatives &amp; made fresh daily. Today when i go there look like alot of item i wanna try sad to say items are sold out like cupcakes eggtarts but yes i am here to try their kaya roti. I can it is super good. As i ate it the kaya is just nice with the slice of butter. They uses SCS butter. The kaya roti cost u $1 each. Look like i am hungry person i order 6 kaya only &amp; 1 cup of tea. Best timing to come when the confectionary start opening for their business. They will close by 4pm. Name:Chin Mee Chin Confectionary. Address:204 East Coast Road Singapore 428903. Tel Number:63450419. Operating:0800hrs to 1600hrs. Closed on Every Mondays. My Lunch Companion @candice.huang @debbiehuang @mademoiselle.melo I know u ladies wanna go there try their all type of their confectionary we can arrange to go there soon but go ard morning when operation of the business . My food buddy @carl_holmberg i app u that i told u i am there today to eat their kaya roti u told me before u last time attended holy family church surprisely u can smell the fragrance of the kaya don\"t worry we shall head there soon we will set time to go.
Which was more like a custard tart. I love crunchy tarts so this was just nice for me. I like the liquidy custard üòã
Woke up early for breakfast today!! There was still a long queue at 900 though! Traditional delights :)
Pie crust egg tart, soft kaya bread buns with a thick slab of butter, and my mandatory kopi-c... Even on such a rainy day, what\'s not to love? üòç
Tea was watered down but loved the smoky hint and bite of the kaya toasts. Nothing to shout about and be prepared to wait.
That iconic Vanilla cake base used for all their cupcake has the signature Vanilla essence aroma that made it so fragrant, but loved the fact how that hardened chocolate over the top wasn\'t too sweet therefore complimenting the cake rather than overwhelming it!
folks\' breakfast on saturday morning after sending off our lovely helper for the past 1.5 yrs to the airport. nostalgia experience, yes, freshness, yes but i wouldnt say is anywhere smacking good. and our eggs came a tad cold.
This is the best place in the East to have kaya butter toast or bun. Really yummidelicious!
My $8.10 breakfast which many found too heavy for one üò≠üò≠üò≠ I have a monstrous appetite. Love everything except for the cream horn which tasted pretty artificial. 
Tang See Fang, was founded by the owner‚Äôs father in 1925.
Kaya had a very strong egg flavour and was very rich! Very generous portion of butter as well
Egg tart. Cream puff. Cupcake. Cream horn. Everything was dry and tasteless.
How I wish I had the luxury to enjoy this egg tart w B now üòß
My errand took me to East side today.\n<br />And since I am around this area, how could I not drop by for their Kopi &amp; Butter Bun\n<br />CMC is here since 1975.
Starting my sunday with traditional local breakfast at this old school coffeeshop.
Q-ed 20mins for the seat and waited for 15mins for the food. My fav is the toasted bun with crisp outer and fluffy inside, spreads with the fragant kaya. Must try! üëçüëçüëç
Beats any Kaya bun store in town. Comfort food at its best.\n<br />Toasted with home made Kaya and salted butter. Puts a smile on my face.
All items ordered seperately. Kopi was full of Nanyang flavour but seemed a bit watered down and not sweet enough. The soft-boiled egg was a wee bit overcooked but possibly due to the length of time taking photos. Kaya toast was best of the lot; generous kaya spread and huge slab of butter. 
Egg Tart was not exactly my favourite because of the thick tart base, but very much loved the creamy and thick curd. The Vanilla cake was a blast to the past with a very fragrant vanilla flavour and a dollop of jam for sweetness.
This place doesn\'t need a recommendation, what with its history, and enthusiastic word of mouth doing it for them. There\'s no better place to head down in your shorts and slippers with a few good friends you\'re too busy to catch up with during the week, and have a comforting breakfast of kaya toast (extra butter pls) and kopi siu dai. Grab as many buns as you can and share! Sometimes nothing beats tradition.
The shell pastry was pretty thick.. good for those who loves the pastry more than the egg custard filling itself!
The strong \"egg\" taste of the Kaya spread is making me Slurps!! The custard tart and the teh are definitely the reason for me to come back again.
My favourite place for good old breakfast ala Singapura style.
Hainanese kaya on cute toasted buns, eggs soft boiled to perfection and kopitiam beverage of your choice. For the simple brunch option. 
Local eats, old school style. More on it and ysd\'s roasted chicken rice on www.asperchee.wordpress.com
Everything is warm and fragrant! Authentic old school in the east. So good.. 
Good ol local breakfast at CMC. Love the vibe here more than the food, which is good but not exactly mind blowing. The aunty is just too cute. 
This place has a Penang kinda vibe. #weekend #brunch #awesome #custardbun
16 Dec‚Äô17, Sat\n<br />Old school delights at Chin Mee Chin Confectionery ÁèçÁæéÁúü...üçû
Kaya bun, soft boiled eggs and teh.
Teh-c kosong (no sugar). An old fashioned cream puff and kaya butter toast which technically is a bun.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Freshly baked. Freshly made traditional kaya. Sitting in this kopitiam made one take a step back and immerse oneself in a slow laid back feel. Good ole simple yummy bakes.

First, a simple breakfast consisting of kaya butter toast, an old school cream puff and teh-c siu dai (less sugar) at a very last century coffeeshop. Satisfying simplicity. ‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />I like things simple. I also like people who are also on the same wavelength; people who do not judge others cos of a mistake or make assumptions without understanding the whole story or giving the cold shoulder. Like my simple breakfast which looked uncomplicated. Just because it had a one color tone does not mean it does not taste good.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Are you perfect??? My cream puff had an irregular shape.. so is the bread. But to me it is simply perfect. \n<br />#oldschool #thoughtfortheday #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #stfoodtrending #sgfollowers #sgbloggers #sgfoodies #nomnom #igfollowers

Old school style at katong\'s famous confectionery!
There\'s nothing like a local breakfast of eggs and kaya toast. All the fancy brunches in the world somehow may never quite measure up to the comfort of a no frills, cheap and authentic breakfast like this. Eggs soft boiled to perfection, soft bun with fragrant kaya, and a self-service assortment of baked goodies that I grew up on, with the likes of cream horns, chocolate cupcakes, and egg tarts. Happy that this place has survived gentrification so far and hope it stays that way.
Start of my compliance leave~ see you next year!
ERMAGAHD.
