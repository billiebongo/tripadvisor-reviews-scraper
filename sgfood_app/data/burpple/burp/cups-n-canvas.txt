the pasta was well cooked! something which I\'m quite particular about. the chilli crab sauce was delicious. a tad sweet, overwhelming chilli crab taste, generous portion of crabmeat.  I\'m quite surprised to find out tt this artsie cafe is already two years old! a gem of a find along selegie rd.
Awesome pan-seared Dory with potato wedges and mushrooms!! GREAT DINNER :)
The red date pudding has this salted caramel coating which was SO GOOD. Ice cream was ordinary.
First time here, must say I love the ambience! The sweet potato latte tastes really rich and the sweetness wasn\'t too overwhelming! Abit gelat though.
The idea of combining an art class centre and a cafe, is ingenious. This is how Cups N Canvas has set itself apart from the hundreds of other cafes. If you think arts is the only thing they specialize in, you\'d be pleasantly surprised with their delicious Blanc Bacon pasta, and fragrant Cafe Latte. Cups N Canvas seems to have it all. You can literally smell art in this cafe.
Pretty color for the sweet potato latte.. and most importantly it\'s not overly sweet. The earl grey cheesecake is so-so..
Stopped by Cups N Canvas for a break today and had their Sweet Potato Latte and Chocolate Truffle Cake. For chocolate lovers, the cake was definitely a winner. However, I am not quite liking the sweet potato latte. It\'s just too of an acquired taste and milky for me.
My first visit here was not disappointed. Delicious Hot Chick Spaghetti and PK Duck sandwich. The taste of the Hot Chick Spaghetti is great even though it\'s a bit too spicy. Relaxing ambience. Great  to drop by to have a cup of coffee or to fill up your stomach after shopping. Will definitely visit here again :)
try the Blanc Bacon!
Tried the sweet potato latte from the \"social menu\" on Burpple. Seems like a must-try secret menu at Cups N Canvas!
Very unique sweet potato latte taste. Not too sweet sticky date pudding and also early grey cheesecake. Nice bear 🐻 latte art. And love the purple color latte. 💜
Feeling so happy because I can finally try their highly raved about Sweet Potato Latte ($4.80)! Just look at the colour, I love it so much. Not too sweet for me, and you can find some sweet potato bits in the latte as well. 
Cups N canvas is a small artisan café place, extremely tantalizing, great cakes at a good price! No service charge! The earl grey cheesecake and sticky date pudding are a \"must-try\"! 
Very beautiful artsy cafe close to my workplace and school-to-come! Great ambience with Wi-Fi and facilities for lap tops. A great place to chill and have a good read.
Amazing blanc bacon pasta! Not too creamy, and is well complimented by the juicy mushroom. Juicy and awesome to the palate :)
What most of us can\'t do without. A nice cup of hot drink that brings perks to what seems a boring day.
NEW POST: Cups N Canvas. Check my review on thedessertprince.com!
This cafe features a humble art space where you can indulge in a cup of coffee while creating art on canvas. That\'s marrying two of my favorite things together. Their all-day breakfast was bold, definitely filling and satisfying. (Approx $24/pax)
Loved this drink! Awesome presentation with its lilac colour and coffee art. 
Cake shared among good friends taste better ( ok this cake wasn\'t fantastic..there was a layer of cake that has a rough texture as compared to the 80% smoothness of the cake. ) The two purple drinks are hot sweet potato lattes. There is a layer of sweet potato \"residue\" at the bottom of the glass 😉. The  brown would be a latte :)
Very unlike those in korea. A much healthier alternative. But this will do for now until my next trip there
Sadly, one of the eggs was overcooked. 
Love the sweet potato latte here. I believe it\'s the only one in Singapore. Nice grainy potato bits at the end. Too addictive!
Hot chocolate and sweet potato latte! AIN\'T THEY CUTE ^^ #cute #drinks
Finger food to kick start the night! Happy Birthday Cups N Canvas!
This is a pretty unique cafe, half of it is a cosy cafe, the other half is an art studio by night. As artsy as I am, not really lovin the ambience here. I wish the air con can be a bit stronger
Probably should be named Taro latte? More milk than sweet potato at the top. Need to stir. Real sweet potato at the bottom. Yummy like a chinese dessert in a drink.
• Life\'s good, with a cup of mocha. :) #coffee #cafe #mocha
In love with their sweet potato latte. Love at first sip! \'Nuff said.
Creamy fettuccine with bacon &amp; mushrooms. Right amount of creaminess. Will NOT make one feel sick after few mouthfuls. 
Bratwurst, Scrambled Eggs, Crispy Bacon, Roasted Potatoes, Sautéed Mushrooms, Grilled Tomatoes, Mesclun, Toast. 
Bright and big windows overlooking people painting, here at Cups &amp; Canvas :) I like my \"ice milo\" (Iced Mocha)
Delightful afternoon snacks. Bread was crunchy and light. 
Pleasant drink in a comfortable environment.

Would have been to die for if there was praline. But it\'s still pretty awesome :D
I couldn\'t seem to take a nice shot as it was too dark. But it\'s really quite nice. Nom nom. I love the texture of the sweet potato paste and taste of milk :D
Artsy space
Cool place
Lunch time quickie chill out. Non caffeinated unique drink with real purple sweet potato. @nicholasgoh
No Problem 🙂

Not bad but it could do better as a side dish instead of my main course due to the lack of meat! #burpple #cupsncanvas #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping

really appreciate the efforts by @cupsncanvas and @sugar_singapore in hosting this cozy event and feeding us well with awesome food 👏 #wewantsugar
Most of us ordered the boneless chicken thigh lunch set at $9.90 that comes with a generous serving of salad and fries. Not too bad but the waiting time was slightly too long 😢😢 #1hourlunchtime #officelife \n<br />#vscocam #burpple #foodporn #foodpornasia #igsg #sgigfoodie #onthetable #sgfood #instafood #whatiate #whati8today #8dayseat #instafood_sg #tags4likes #followme #vscocamsg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cupsncanvas

Curled flower stalk or carousel of hearts?
Nice carrot cake and their signature sweet potato latte
🍴
The cuttlefish balls looked rather ordinary but turned out good, and peach-lychee tea is 👍👍

(8) Cups N Canvas - Sweet Potato Latte, PK Duck Ciabatta, Potato Wedges in Cheesy dip.. I managed to finish them all by myself.. haha! Was so hungry coz I skipped breakfast this morning for the early morning meeting with the charity. I don\'t know if the guy in the counter is the manager or the owner.. he\'s very friendly and accommodating.. If you happen to pass by Wilkie Edge, go visit the cafe! #sg #singapore #weekend #cafehopping #cafehunting #cafestovisitinsg #potatowedges #ciabatta #latte #sweetpotatolatte #burpple

Sweet potato latte at Cups N Canvas - refreshingly sweet with bits of sweet potato, almost reminded me of Bubur Cha Cha. Goodness packed into a small cup :) #latteart #sweetpotato #latte #cafehopping #cafe #danieleats
