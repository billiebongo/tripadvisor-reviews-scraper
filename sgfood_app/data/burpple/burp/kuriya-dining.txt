So fresh, I thought I was in Japan.
Perfectly seared Wagyu, uni and a fresh dollop of ikura. What could possibly go wrong ?

first time trying and the sashimi were really fresh! they also offered free sashimi cutting for takeaway!
Sashimi customized to our liking, so fresh! 
It\'s not cheap but for what ure paying for quality is good. Akashi is shit compared to this and price is similar 
And yes that is potato cream on top. Yum.
Best thing here was the pretty large caramel macaron (kudos for not making it salted caramel). I savoured every bite and was sad to see it go.
Simmered oyster, gluten mochi, boiled sweet prawn with creamy crab gut, beef tongue and steamed uni with water eggplant. Looks exquisite but really nothing much. Please, please don\'t ever do anything to uni - to truly justify it you have to have it raw!
one of the better value joints for sushi
best piece of Ubi Keledek goreng (sweet potato tempura)
#lunch earlier this afternoon.. Sashimi.
