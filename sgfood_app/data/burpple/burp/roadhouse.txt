Located on Dempsey hill, Roadhouse promises Josper-grilled burger patties and meats with fantastic flavour and that perfect char. If you love bacon, go straight for their Bacon Marinated Burger - a delicious combination of melted gorgonzola, streaky bacon, caramelised onions, garlic mayonnaise, sauteed mushrooms, and of course, a 170g Josper-grilled wagyu beef patty. Complete your all-American meal with a side of cheese or truffle fries! The dim light and satisfying food makes for a great spot for date nights and family meals.
Best s\'more ice cream cake ever. I don\'t mind making a trip here just for their s\'more ice cream cake 😊
Awesome 170g of WAGYU patty+homemade bun+nicely caramelized onions+sautéed mushrooms+crispy streaky bacon+neatly arranged fries = Nothing like heaven :)
Unhealthly good.
Moist, juicy, flavorful with a tinge of spice. I lovessssssing it. ;p
looks good but really average burgers. not fantastic. its a prawn grilled burger. maybe their beef ones are better. I\'ll nevee know.
Roadhouse a great for a nice night out that won\'t burn a hole in your pocket. The 3-course Valentine\'s Day special is pretty cool at only $68 per couple. Alternatively, go for the classics that can\'t go wrong like the bacon marinated burger or the mushroom wagyu burger. Get some truffle fries to share too. The ambiance is lovely, dim and intimate yet vibrant and casual at the same time. Dress up or dress down as you like, it\'s just about good food and good company here. 
Banana Ricotta Fritters. Sweet, mushy bananas deep-fried in oh-so-light and crispy batter, served in a sticky pool of toblerone chocolate sauce. So worth the calories. #bananas #fritters #chocolate #dessert #bitesize #sweet #sinful #yum #sugarhigh #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
High on Shrooms. Forced myself to have a quarter of this (I hate mushrooms) wagyu beef burger with forest mushrooms, and was quite surprised at how much I liked the earthy flavours punctuated with truffle oil. #beef #burger #mushrooms #truffle #foodporn #sgfood #american #ilovemyjob
Pigs Can Fly. Not impressed by the too-tough slabs of crispy pork belly. Also didn\'t find the sesame-garlic mayo dressing flavourful enough. #pork #porkbelly #burger #coleslaw #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Bacon Marinated. Hard to go wrong with beef, bacon, and caramelised onions. I also love the banana strawberry milkshake (in the background). #burger #beef #bacon #onions #meat #foodporn #milkshake #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Japanese Prawn Star. Panko-crusted patty made with crunchy shrimp and a wasabi mayonnaise dressing - it packs just enough heat to tease tastebuds, but not overwhelm. #prawn #burger #wasabi #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Chick\'N Lick\'N Good. Breaded chicken thigh with lettuce and chipotle mayo. I found this kinda underwhelming, unfortunately. #chicken #burger #meat #foodporn #american #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Roadhouse has a communal table just right for all of you to sit down to a fantastic burger. Don\'t leave without trying the Bacon Marinated burger, it\'s everything you\'d want in a beautifully Josper-grilled wagyu burger. If you\'re dining with a bunch of big eaters, go for \"The Terminator\" challenge- finish a burger of 6 wagyu patties in 20 minutes and you\'ll get it for free!
For $32, this burger offers a pretty large slab of seared foie gras on top of a 179g Wagyu patty
Ordered this thinking tt it\'s the thick kinda onion rings. A lil overpriced. 
Gooey marshmallow sandwiched between two chocolate chip cookies served with a smear of peanut butter because, why not?
Josper-grilled beef patties with foie gras and mango salsa MMMM!
Essentially a deconstructed cheeseburger with the bun cut up into wedges and the patty and all the works combined into a bowl of incredibly cheesy and chunky sauce. I found this a little too salty though...
Extremely Crispy outside and soft fluffy potato inside with amazing Truffle flavored tartar sauce 👍😛👍. S$6 alcarte or free flow with every main or burger ordered.
I think my burger was called sugar and everything (something like that). I chose wagyu as the patty, it was juicy but was hinder by the jam. I wish they didn\'t overcooked the egg! I was expecting the yolk to run the down the burger..sigh. Overall it was Good! Onion rings were good but I wished it was less oily. The batter soaked up lots of oil
Mac n Cheese Burger ($15++) very nice wor. Going for birthday dinner 🎉 with my future \'daughter-in-law\' 😅 Gonna be noisy. .\n<br />.\n<br />13 Dempsey Road (Right at the corner) #needtohitthegym #burgerporn #macncheese #burger #sgfood #sgcafe #cafefood #foodsg #cafe #sgbrunch #stfoodtrending #burpple #burpplesg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #instafood #foodphotography #sgcoffee #instafoodsg #brunch #sgeats #sgmakandiary #8dayseat

the doctor just put me on a special diet which eliminates all the food i so love. i\'ve got half a mind to kill myself now. before i do that, here\'s a throwback from a few days ago.
Wagyu beef patty, sunny side up egg, caramelized onions, mushrooms, iceberg lettuce &amp; garlic mayo - pretty decent but thought they overcooked my beef slightly
Eat and worry later..
Compact but aromatic.
\'Prawn Star\' was kinda overzealous with spices &amp; salt to feel fully fulfilled. Should have ordered B.Y.O.D cos look, its wagyu beef again.  #burpple #foodinstagram #foodinstagram #foodporn #birthdaywods #oct2015
