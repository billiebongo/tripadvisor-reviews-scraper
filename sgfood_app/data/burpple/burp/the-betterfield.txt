$99 for this beef platter, blowtorched right before your eyes. Accompanied with truffle mushroom sauce, garlic chips, sea salt and some tartar-mustard sauce (which I thought was a tad redundant), I would say that it\'s a pretty magical medium-rare cook on the beef and party in the mouth; with the right amount of fat, chewiness and charred-ness to it albeit not being a beef fan at all.
Following in the footsteps of that one place which shall not be named that committed suicide by social media, the Betterfield is letting you slide some golden sticky icky onto anything you so desire for an additional charge of $10.
Till today only, swing by their place to get DOUBLE portion of their Raclette cheese (additional $10 on top of their beef, pasta or risotto) for the price of one! Haven\'t been here for a while and decided to go big and went for their TRUFFLE raclette cheese ($15). Truffle, cheese and beef ‚ù§Ô∏è
Pretty good though not as great as I expected. We also ordered the mushroom risotto which everyone liked, and the duck fat potatoes which were just alright, kinda dry. Wish we ordered the brie for starters instead. There was an event in one half of the resto when we went so service was a bit erratic. The chef was really friendly though! The place was huge but lacking in ambience.
Really liked the food and environment. The tables were very spaced out which I like because you\'re not too near strangers. Ordered the duck fat potatoes ($16) and the sauce, nacho cheese and potatoes was great. If you like crispy shredded duck meat, you\'ll like this extra much. Then I got the 200g of black Angus ribeye ($22) which I think started of good but the portion was way to big for 1 person. So got too full and tired of chewing in the end.
Order a 300g Angus beef but was given a much smaller portion. I ordered with friends and we chose to ate first as the food came so that it wouldn\'t turn cold. \n<br />After i started eating my friend\'s dish came and mine was considerably smaller. When we communicated this to the server she understood and went to the kitchen to convey the message but another waiter came to say it was weighed before cooking.\n<br />Eat at your own risk as they may choose to cheat you.
[$16]\n<br />.\n<br />Fats + Carbs + Salt can probably never go wrong. üëçüèªüê∑ #howtonotbefat #burpple #betterfield
Apparently, as I\'ve been told, The Betterfield fares better in the steak department than the risotto department, and I\'m glad to prove this rumor right.
Prawn risotto that is absolutely tasty. The broth stock used (probably chicken), is ever present in the risotto, helps to gel everything together. Risotto is cooked right on that day, unlike some of the reviews I have read previously. And the taste of the tiger prawns is so distinct in the risotto, that it\'s almost like having \"Hei Mee\". Love the consistency of the risotto, clearly sucking on that prawn head, is a must! 
Brought my family to finally try the Betterfield. In true honesty, if it\'s ain\'t for the awfully yummy, value-for-money  Angus beef, I don\'t think I will ever bring them over for a meal. 
Go because you\'re a steak lover, and a big eater. The Betterfield still and by far, served affordable and extremely well cooked meat. That pink inside, and that charred outside certainly is enough without that extra homemade truffle mustard sauce. But if you like a variation of taste, have the meat with he sauce. It only enhance, and stretch your imagination. \n<br />PS; sadly it can only be said for the steak. You can pass on the rest of the menu.
Those who watched the Hentak Taki short on YouTube would get the joke. This place has had more than its fair share of hype, but does it live up to the high expectations that\'s been set?
Craving for good food after \"escaping\" frm a yucky island. We ordered Omakaze: grade 7 marbling wagyu beef steak @ $42 with foie gras (additional $12): the beef was fatty and yummy, perfectly done and aburi-ed. foie gras was unfortunately overdone üò¢ so not so worth it for $12 for a tiny piece without the feeling of goose fat melting-in-mouth euphoria. Scallop Risotto: generous amounts of scallops found! üòç richly flavoured, would definitely come back and hope i get to try the uni risotto that may appear as the omakaze dish of the day!!! Drinks: Serendipity (passionfruit &amp; southern tea in yellow) - i prefer this one, quite refreshing for a hot, thirsty diver üòÖ. Bears on the Ledge (blue cura√ßao, elderflower, ginger ale, cranberry juice &amp; gummy bears) : tasted more like sugar syrup water üòï well im not a fan of sugary drinks anyways. But overall, i think its quite a nice place to go to!!! I would definitely return üòä
Ordered the Wagyu Mbs 7. 200g. It was really flavourful with the sea salt and he chef\'s signature truffle mustard. It was so good in fact, My gf and I ordered it twice. Cause 200g wasnt enough. Also had the Duck Confit which was a little cold. Could have been warmer. Humble dish that isn\'t too salty but I would definitely recommend the steak.
Huge simplistic space with loads of seatings, good place for gatherings/big groups. Prompt service. Had the Black Angus Ribeye Steak ($22 for 200g) which was flavorful (accompanied by a slight charred taste) and sprinkled w sea salt flakes. Overall a palatable dish; truffle mustard was a lil rich and salad dressing was way too acidic. Still would patronize if I\'m craving for steak w a tight budget!  
‚ÄãBeefy, bloody and bizarrely hard to get right, steak has an appeal far beyond the average piece of meat for me. The best steak I ever ate was my first Wagyu steak. The year was 2007, and it was served at a little-known diner called Astons Specialties at East Coast Road that would soon become a household name synonymous with quality and affordability steaks. Weighing 250g and priced at $150, the Grade 11 Wagyu striploin steak arrived perfectly pink in the middle, and it delivered flavour, tenderness and juiciness in a combination. Nearly a decade after eating it, I\'m still moved by the memories of the experience.
Steak was flavourful and beautifully seared, price was pretty good at $25
Got the highly raved steak, but it was quite inconsistent and rather chewy in some portions of the steak. The flavours however, were there - peppery with a hint of truffle from the truffle mustard sauce that accompanied it. I have had better steak - but I guess it\'s not bad with the price you pay! 
I was really excited to see the beautiful pink shade in my medium-rare tagliata (after having it over-cooked the last time I was there). While the kitchen still serves pretty great dishes, they definitely have to work more on plating. I was quite shocked to see our steak being stacked into an unsightly pile, ringing my OCD alarm to re-arrange the meat myself.
The star is obviously the marvellous 200 gm patty, lightly seasoned to allow for the natural flavours of the beef to shine through. At $25 nett, this limited edition burger rivals the best in town, in terms of quality and value üôå
Throwback to dinner the other time with @patricoantonio over at @thebetterfield. This Omakase option ($35) was a dish that I wanted to try for the longest time &amp; managed to get it, with the right ingredients, of course. This lovely art piece includes fresh &amp; plump scallops, generous slabs of uni &amp; rich, thick Uni essence that is absorbed by the risotto. \n<br />Not only does this fella look good, it tastes even better. Can\'t wait to find time to head back for more!
PRICE: Ribeye 200g $22, Creme de Canard $20, Pitcher of Mocktail $10  
Pure meaty deluxe. 300g can be shared among two pax but I didn\'t felt like sharing.
It was ok for the few mouthful but took us tremendous effort to finish the plate. The plating still have lots of room for improvement.
However, the taste was disappointing. The dash of curry powder and \"few drops of fallen cheese\" around the fries. üò≠üò≠üò≠
Their menu looked almost the same. So we started off with their duck confit. \n<br />Berry sauce with crispy duck. Well matched with the spinach and saut√©ed mushroom. \n<br />The main carb of this dish - creamy potato was not as great. Way too peppery to handle and overwhelming Rosemary used. \n<br />Do take note that Their dinner service started from 6pm to 10pm.
I couldn\'t decide between the mentaiko scallop or salted egg spaghetti, and the staff recommended the latter. The sauce is thick and grainy like the usual molten salted egg texture, but I could hardly taste its characteristic briny flavour - way overpowered by the copious amount of garlic bits. Tiger prawns were plump but not very fresh judging from the slightly off prawn heads. A wee bit disappointed with this dish. #Burpple
We order the medium rare ribeyes steak ,meat was tender and juicy but the ends may get a little chewy ,this is not the best but if u compare the price for such dish is consider value of money .Overall rating :3/5 
After a month long closure, The Betterfield at Waterloo Street has re-opened at The Treasury, just a five-minute walk from City Hall MRT station. The sprawling compound is five times bigger than its previous location, making it the perfect place to accommodate large group gatherings. It\'s also good for couples looking for an affordable date night over quality eats. The menu has also been updated with new dishes, but rest assured, the old favourites are still around. Start your meal with one of the new additions to the menu ‚Äî the addictively tasty Cheese Curry Fries ($12) that comes with a dollop of Japanese curry mayo. For mains, go for the French Duck Confit ($22) and the crowd pleasing Black Angus Ribeye Steak ($22 for 200g, $32 for 300g and $40 for 400g). Add Foie Gras ($12) to elevate your meal and sate your carnivorous cravings!\n<br />Avg price: $30 per person
The aroma of the dish was amazing and this is for the real meat lovers! It is a delicious cut of meat, with a medium-rare interior and a lovely crust on the exterior. Rich intense flavours! Still as good as ever!
From now till the end of May, the omakase option will be the C√¥te de Bouef ($11 per 100g) and chef will personally prepare, slice and blowtorch this magnificent cut right in front of your eyes.\n<br />.\n<br />The BetterField\n<br />Address: 100, High Street, The Treasury, Singapore 179434
Finally made my way to the new 142-seater at The Treasury! A big space that\'s perfect for large groups &amp; what\'s best is that now you get some variation of beef &amp; an Omakase option! That aside, our medium rare beef that we ordered came with a perfect pink center &amp; charred just right on the outside. Don\'t say I didn\'t tell you about this üòâ
Fresh, creamy scallops that tastes like the sea. If you like that fishy taste, you can\'t go wrong with this.
Delicious pasta flavoured with salted egg. The prawns are juicy and generous portion.
Many of the iconic dishes are still there with the addition of several new items such as Red Cheddar Scallop Tots, Cheese Curry Fries and Mentaiko Superior Japanese Scallops Pasta. One of my favourites, the Hot Melted Brie ($16), as pictured, is an entr√©e that I highly recommend you to order as the breaded brie with the berry compote and grana padano will literally melt your heart away.\n<br />.\n<br />The BetterField\n<br />Address: 100, High Street, The Treasury, Singapore 179434
@thebetterfield is now opened at its swanky NEW location at The Treasury, 100 High Street. Be sure to check out the \'Omakase\', a showcase of the Chef\'s seasonal curated ingredients. For a start, expect the marvellous C√¥te de Boeuf. This a must-try for all steak aficionados! At $11 per 100g, it\'s probably the most VALUE-FOR-MONEY cut out there üêÆüòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of The BetterField.
This got to be the best thing ever! Anyway better field is gonna reopen at 100 High Street and tomorrow is going to be the opening day. Do come by and patronise them! \n<br />#thebetterfield #burrple #exsgcafes #cafehopping #exploresingapore #visitsingapore #yoursingapore
Available as an omakase option at their spanking new location from today until 31st May, the C√¥te de Bouef (also known as the Rib Steak) is a jaw-dropping hunk of red meat with bone included. It is first presented whole, then sliced and torched table-side. Depending on what else is ordered, the large cut can be shared between 2 to 3 people. If however, you are an ardent steak lover, you may want this all to yourself. 
‚Ä¢\n<br />Who wants lava cake when you can have your Brie and eat it with crunch on the outside and the oh-so-lovely melted cheese on the inside. This dish is essentially what a good dish is all about - Supposedly simple ingredient prepared with the simplest cooking method. Simplicity is by no means simple as it requires a high level of culinary technique, more restraint and more sensitivity to the ingredient. This melted Brie serve with berry compote is all about ingredients and cooking techniques at its best. Enough said, period.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Thank you @thebetterfield for the invitation tonight.
The Betterfield opens TODAY at its new location at The Treasury (100 High Street). Bright and very spacious, it can seat 142 diners, which makes this place worth considering if you are celebrating birthdays or organising gatherings.
Hot piping and crispy thin cut fries coated with secret curry spice and served with Japanese curry mayo. Really yummy and some of us thought it tasted like Twisties albeit the less salty version. Yums! A big portion good for 3-4 to share! 
. \n<br />With this new beginning, they will feature an expanded menu, bigger space and longer opening hours (8am - 11pm)! Featured: Red Cheddar Scallop Tots SGD 16 Nett.\n<br />Think fresh Japanese Scallops baked with cheese and served with delicious mini hash browns. üòã #freewifisg
The dish looks awfully simple.. Yet again, steak is best served simple :). I got my steak medium rare (best way to have steak)..the meat was tender and flavourful but I would have definitely preferred it more moist. \n<br />But the mustard (was it mustard? Truffle mustard?) was super good that my dear friend @happypositiveangel finished hers and stole from my other colleague. Haha.. Overall 3.7/5 and service could have been much better but certainly worth it for $17.90.
But it is ok, because this chicken is stuffed with goodness of foie gras! \n<br />OMG, the tender chicken with the creamy fat chunk of foie gras was too addictive and unforgettable on the last day! \n<br />Thank you for being amazing and always feed us with awesome dishes at affordable prices. We shall countdown and look forward to you growing bigger and better! üí™
Say what?! Hahaha this is a ball of brie encased with breadcrumbs (if I\'m not wrong) then deep fried, such that the cheese becomes sticky and gooey (no, not molten). SO GOOD OMGAH but please share it cos it\'ll get too jelat for one!
We realized it was the last night before The Betterfield would be closing their current location and moving so we quickly made a reservation and hopped on by. 
Ribeye steak with really delish truffle mustard sauce. Their set lunch comes with a drink and it\'s only $17.90 in total. Totally worth the money.
Decided to head down to The Betterfield before they move to a new location.
I could eat it all day every day, as unhealthy as it is. \n<br />Roasted duck fat-soaked potatoes with crispy duck &amp; topped with a nacho cheese &amp; truffle mayonnaise. That is pure genius. \n<br />On a side note, I heard that they are gonna relocate to greener pastures soon, so head down while you can to enjoy the cosy space!
The perfect combination for any beef steak is to get it slightly seared on the outside and medium rare on the inside. Anything beyond that is just disrespecting the cut which is a total waste for such a fine piece of meat.
More specifically a deep fried brie on a charcoal bun topped with parmesan cheese? Pro tip is to have a bit of everything, including the berry compote for an explosive bite.
From 28 Mar to 10 Apr, you can order a minimum of 3 various beef to enjoy it in a sampling platter, where Chef Shaun will flame it up and serve with 5 different condiments. THE BEST ONE WAS A FAT SLAB OF TRUFFLE PASTE! I wiped it clean üòÇ too awesome! \n<br />We tried the Riverine ($25.90), Aaco ($27.90) and Wagyu Mv4 ($42). Try the Aaco and you will leave the place with no regrets. Anyway, do patronize @thebetterfield before they move in late Apr! \n<br />On a side note, thank you to all who have participated in the truffle dish with @anymapsg! Congrats to @stellastelios and Brian Bong who had participated via my blog!
\nI swear I only ordered the Teys Riverine ribeye. But then, out walked Chef Shaun bearing this massive wooden board. On it was not just my steak and my friend\'s order of an AACo ribeye but a complimentary piece of Black Angus too; each weighing in at 200gms. Lined up along one side of the board was an eye-popping myriad of condiments that included a new truffle paste, The Betterfield\'s signature truffled mayo and assorted salts of the exotic type. As per his usual style, Chef Shaun briskly did his \"fire-blasting\" final touch to the meats at the table. After that, there was no stopping our attack. 
Price Update: SGD 22 Nett as of 17 May 2016. Eat it at @thebetterfield !
The result of months of development, every mouthful is an explosion of creamy umami from the uni essence and the Parmesan that goes into the rice. Topped with uni sashimi from Hokkaido, drizzled with French sea urchin essence and finished with some Hokkaido uni paste on the side. I have not had uni paste or sea urchin essence before this, and all I can say about them is that I NEED THEM IN MY PANTRY NOW. They both look like an indiscreet paste/liquid, but the hit of umami you get when it reaches your tongue is so intense, and so powerful. It would send you into a temporary state of delirium each time it enters your mouth. Normally served with scallops, ours had garlic butter prawns on the side as the scallops were unavailable to the surprise we sprang on the chef. Would I eat this again? ABSOLUTELY, without a doubt. \n<br />Now that you are salivating and cannot stop thinking about this uni risotto, I regret to inform you that this dish is not for sale. \n<br />I would add that we had an amazing time at @thebetterfield listening to chef Shaun sharing his food stories while we wiped out the delicious food in record time. The risotto was wiped out minutes from it reaching the table, and the other dishes shared the same fate.
As mentioned by Chef Sean, these items are not on the official menu &amp; are made specially! \n<br />To our delight &amp; good luck, we were able to be treated to this lovely delicacy ($35) while came with so much uni goodness, I might just be dreaming of it tonight! \n<br />Each mouthful oozes out umami flavors &amp; I definitely couldn\'t stop at just one mouth! \n<br />Thank you once again, Chef Sean for making this exception &amp; for being such a good host to us during our first trip down. &amp; good seeing the CW team again üôÜüèª
Maybe I had overly high expectations after reading many positive reviews on this special and trending dish that is not on the menu, I was rather disappointed. üò¢
A really special flavor. Pretty good rendition with a subtle matcha taste. It\'s a new item at The Betterfield\'s. Have you tried it yet?
Wanted to try their prawn risottos but prawns were sold out.. Rice was well cooked, al dente and grains were separated. The sauce was creamy and very rich. But because I am not a fan of creamy sauce, this was a little jelak for me. Suitable for cream sauce lovers who enjoys truffle too.
It\'s has been one of my favourite places to go to for a meal that it deserves more than just one post! I have been consistently recommending this place to many of my friends and I have also heard many positive reviews from it. One such indulgent is the Roasted Duck Fat Potatoes ($15), a dish where the potatoes are firstly roasted in duck fat before serving with crispy duck, a dollop of nacho cheese and many squeezes of the truffle mayonnaise.
Carnivores love meat and know meat. This piece of 400g Australian steak was not only well-executed, it costs only $38. What a steal! üòâ
Diners can opt to change the prawns to scallops for an additional $3. What can I say, Betterfield has always been one of my favourites and every single visit has never been disappointing. The umami flavour in the sauce is so good that after finishing the pasta, you wish you had some bread to soak all the leftover sauce up or rice to mix it with.
This dish is essentially what a good dish is all about - Supposedly simple ingredient prepared with the simplest cooking method.

Those days when you feel like having steak without breaking the bank. üòÖ
If you ever were lucky to tried out @thebetterfield\'s UNI RISOTTO - this was definitely the level up version of that! Topped with 2 halves of USA BOSTON LOBSTER BLOW TORCHED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!! Credits to @juliuslim with his NZ Manuka honey sea salt which gave the lobster an extra sweet flavour boost! The results super sweet fresh tender lobster meat! \n<br />Interestingly, notice the light orange ring around the dish? That is actually sea urchin Essence, used also in the risotto, leaving it super packed with the flavours of the sea! \n<br />This is sadly NOT FOR SALE, thank you Shaun again for yet another Good Friday dinner!
Another of Chef Shaun\'s masterpiece and definitely one of his best ones yet. This dish contained lobsters, air flown from the USA, that were sprinkled with some of New Zealand\'s Manuka sea salt before being pan seared and sitting on top a bed of sea urchin infused arborio rice with more uni being added for the luxurious touch. When served, you are in for a spectacle as the lobsters were torched on the spot to bring out the charred flavour and smokiness.
A crispy exterior revealing warm, soft gooey goodness within üòú went with with the toasted base and berry sauce.
Already lost count on the number of times I visited The Betterfield but his risotto is a must order whenever I\'m there. Salted egg risotto is another new flavour that was introduced to me lately. Yes you read it right! It is salted egg! The risotto was cooked perfectly al dente as usual, with each grain offering a little resistance to your teeth. The salted egg flavor was not as strong as expected but there\'s still a balance in taste which you won\'t have problem finishing it by yourself.

First with duck confit, then popcorn chicken mentaiko, and now Salted Egg Risotto ($22). Do note that this is not on the menu, so ask and you shall be given! \n<br />East meets West concept by infusing the ever popular salted egg sauce with Italian Arborio risotto, and served generously with 4 tiger prawns! \n<br />Overall texture was al-dente, though I commented that salted egg sauce wasn\'t distinctive enough. At r&amp;d stage, chef Shaun shared that he needs to balance the \'jelakness\' of the salted egg sauce, which makes sense if 1 person orders and finishes all by himself/herself. \n<br />Not complaining, because the overall flavour was aromatic and garlicky üòÇ
Look at that pink üôÉ\n<br />Not the best steak, but surprisingly good and generous given the odd cafe setting and price. Would have preferred it more tender, though the crisp char edges gave the steak a nice contrast of textures and flavours. 
Love the combination of truffle oil, mushrooms and cheesy pasta, but I still prefer the more flavourful rendition by Cicely Kitchen. The portion and ingredients for this dish are generous though üëçüèª
This version is different from others I have tried. Other Aglio Olio often tastes strongly of garlic and chilli but this has an unique taste I can\'t quite place. The tiger prawns are fresh and scrumptious. And they have kindly removed most of the shell, leaving only the heads and tails, making it really easy to eat. Though a little oily, it\'s a respectable dish but my favourite dish at The Betterfield remains to be their duck confit.
Pictured here is the ridiculously good Deep Fried Brie ($15 NETT)! Sitting on top their black charcoal bun, encased in a crisp breadcrumb shell is molten melted whole slab of brie cheese! The whole thing is about the size of a palm, so good that you got easily eat one whole thing yourself without feeling jelat! (I guess the mixed berry sauce plays a good part too!) A huge thank you to Shaun for another good meal!! üôåüèª Wishing more good years ahead, and more awesome food creations!
Trying out the steak in medium rare and it was really good. No bloody taste as I would have expected and the meat was really tender, ah Ma Liu üëµüèº could chew with ease! If you are all out to treat yourself - add on $12 for an additional big fatty piece of Foie Gras üòª
Salted Egg Prawn Risotto ($22 NETT)!!! With the salted egg yolk items being on a rampage nowadays, anything can be infused with it!  The taste of salted egg yolk could be made more prominent to give it a bit more punch but since it\'s still under R&amp;D for his - might be new menu, we can definitely look forward to something exciting in the near future üòâ
Crispy shredded duck, saut√©ed potatoes that comes in nacho cheese and truffle mayonnaise. Sinful but hard to stop yourself from going back for more.
The \"mentaiko\" (marinated roe of the pollock and cod fish) Chef Shaun used to make his pasta sauce, was specially imported from Japan and he said there\'s a discernible difference when you eat it. True. Somehow, rather than just being one-dimensionally salty, I felt it tasted rich, almost creamy and more complex.\n<br />Not that this dish needed much else but there\'re prawns included. And they were far from itsy-bitsy.\n<br />Due to the type of pasta used, the spaghetti veered to the firm side and required a bit of chewing but I didn\'t mind. Better to have that than overcooked mush.\n
Get real with your date at this unpretentious restaurant at Waterloo Street. Forget fancy, fine dining here ‚Äî tables are packed elbow-to-elbow in the small space, there‚Äôs a lingering scent of the kitchen in the air and decor is kept to the bare minimum. Yet, regulars praise the place to the highest heavens, and with good reason. Helmed by chef Shaun Gian, the kitchen turns out perfectly executed European fare at prices that don\'t break the bank. Expect tasty eats like Truffle Fries ($7 for medium, $13 for large), Duck Confit ($21) and the crowd favourite, Prawn Risotto ($20). That said, the star of the night has to be the Black Angus Ribeye Steak, which comes in three different sizes ($21 for 200g, $38 for 400g and $50 for 600g). Seasoned simply with salt and pepper, and pan-seared to attain a lightly charred crust, the pinkish slabs of melt-in-your-mouth goodness are best enjoyed with dollops of the truffle-infused mayonnaise. Add Foie Gras ($12) to elevate your meal and sate your carnivorous cravings! End on a sweet note with their newly introduced Japanese Matcha Creme Br√ªl√©e ($7.90).
Recommended by Chef Shaun for its flavour, the pleasure I drew from this piece of Australian beef was on par with the rest of the steaks I\'ve had here (the Wagyu being in a slightly different league of course).\n<br />Big on flavour and tender even though it\'s not obviously fatty, this ribeye tasted wonderful with and without The Betterfield\'s signature sauce.\n<br />I had to add the foie gras as well because saying no to a hefty piece of goose liver (that costs only $12!) is plain nuts.
When it comes to deliciously cooked steaks that are genuinely value-for-money, I think this place is hard to beat. \n<br />The 200gm serving of Full Blood Wagyu I had costs $50 and it was worth every cent. Not only was the plating out of the norm, so were the accompaniments of truffle oil-dressed baby tomatoes, some dry spices and two kinds of sea salt flakes mixed together. There\'s no doubt being torched at the table as a finishing touch imparts an extra oomph to the magnificent beef. I could literally hear the fat in the meat sizzle, crackle and pop under the fire! 
I have had baked cheeses before but this encrusted-with-crunchiness and warm-and-gooey-on-the-inside Brie was something else. Served on a slice of soft black bread, the creamy mildness of the cheese paired really well with the accompanying sweet berries sauce. I recommend ordering it to share among 3 to 4 persons so you\'ll still have ample tummy space for the main courses.
Unfortunately, I am not sure whether the chef had a bad day or I am the unlucky one. \n<br />Ribeye Set Meal ($15.90) - The ribeye was tough and really dry. The sauce itself at least helped made the process much simpler to swallow the meat. The drink that came along with the set meal was also extremely diluted .. Sigh a disappointment! Previous experience was so good! ‚òπÔ∏è
Price Update: SGD 22 Nett as of 17 May 2016. 200g of ribeye steak (medium) with tender juicy meat and an uniquely crispy crust not commonly found elsewhere. Served with side salad and some tasty truffle mustard sauce. Also available in 400g or 600g portions. Other breeds like Wagyu and Riverine are also available. A good place for good beef at a pocket friendly price. Read more about it at http://myfoodstory.sg
Who says salad can\'t be nice? This one is! Fresh veggies with tender pulled duck in Thai sauce and truffle mayo. Despite the name, there\'s nothing crispy about it (sorry you won\'t find the delicious duck confit skin here). But it\'s still tasty and beautiful to boot! 
Truffle Fries ($8 for Medium) - Smells divine, but can\'t taste any truffle. Fries were also way too salty. Didn\'t fancy the cheese bits. Unfortunately, I wouldn\'t order this again.
Prawn Risotto ($20) - This was tasty &amp; enjoyable. My only gripe was that there were Prawn shell/leg bits inside the risotto itself. So once in awhile, while chowing down on the delicious, creamy &amp; soft risotto, a random prawn leg would poke the back of my throat. Not cool.
Black Angus Steak ($21 for 200g)
.\n<br />|\n<br />Good crust formed by the touch of the torch. The pepper got slight char which might be misled it to be burnt. But this char-ness made the taste more complex and mature which I loved it. Very good beef. Especially for this price.
because the boys had a late xmas feasting, we had to make it count with some pyro too. yesterday\'s 60 days dry aged cote de boeuf at betterfield was motherf**king insanely goodest to the moon good. because dry aging, the rich, i mean very rich fats are intense buttery and an uber tenderness on the meat. gotta say chef shaun\'s execution of medium rare is almost innate and his second nature. torching it gets you that crust to contrast with the heavenly meat and paired it with either the equally good spiced duck fat potatoes or just dap into sea salt, crushed black pepper by the side to send your buds into hyperoverdrive.
Rich intense flavours in its own with plenty of delicious fat marbling though it! It has an amazing balance of its distinctive rich flavour and tenderness compared to other beef. Just a dash of White Maldon Seasalt and Black Falk Seasalt work wonders!
Technically The BetterField is not certified halal because they serve alcoholic drinks but they source all ingredients from halal suppliers. The restaurant focuses mainly on the French cuisine. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
In the Dhoby Ghaut/Bras Basah area and in the mood for quality steak without breaking the bank? Look no further than The BetterField! You get to enjoy 200g of exquisite Black Angus steak for just $21. 
The texture of the meat is very fresh and succulent with a hint of sweetness and the butter sauce is very much to my liking too. This is a new dish that is off the menu and it is only available by phone reservation from 10th Dec to 21st Dec.
For truffle lovers, this is a must try. Many places offer truffle fries as an entree and even McDonald jumped onto the bandwagon with its shaker fries. However, at the Betterfield, you get the real deal. Not only truffle oil was used, real and solid bits of truffle can be seen from the sauce provided. This is the most amazing truffle fries I have tried I will certainly be back again for my truffle fix! 
Front dish: 400g Black Angus Rib-eye Steak, medium rare cooked to perfection. Back dish: Duck leg confit, slightly charred and goes perfectly with the jam.
The marbling was perfect, with the tender meat and fat delivering a kick of joy straight to my brain. \n<br />The icing on the cake, or in this case, my steak, has got to be the foie gras. A choir of angels literally sang when I bit into that seared piece of heaven, indescribably divine.
Chef Shaun yesterday had introduced a mouthwatering juicy dry aged beef burger, served on pink buns with salad and fries for a limited time only. The exterior of the beef patty has a decent char, retaining its enhanced beefy flavour and tenderness on the inside. His secret recipe sauce also add a sweetness that balances the funky flavor of the beef. The buns seems a little soft to my liking, but nonetheless an incredible price of S$25 for a dry aged beef burger!
Sea Urchin Risotto ($35) - classic risotto with cheese, a whole load of sea urchin goodness such as sashimi and paste from Japan, essence from France together with scallops + roe! \n<br />The umami-heavy finish to the rich and creamy risotto was consistency concentrated with sea urchin flavour, and it was soul-satisfying.\n<br />Somewhat briny yet sweet at the same time, the sea urchin had a rather firm texture and it complements well with the Al dente Italian Arborio. \n<br />The plump and juicy scallops even came with roe, and all the ingredients were combined together in a vibrant chorus. \n<br />Do note that this item will be part of a new menu, so you may want to call @thebetterfield to ask if it is available!
Meltingly tender flesh, lovingly cooked in its own fat, paired with berry compote to cut the greasiness; laid on a bed of delicate spinach leaves, mushroom fricass√©e, and slow roasted duck fat potatoes.
Enjoyed the burnt mentaiko eggs royale here. This was a refreshing take on an all-time favourite brunch item. The mentaiko sauce was flavourful and complemented the salmon very nicely. The charcoal bun was also a great substitute for the usual English muffin!
Featuring the Cafe Latte ($5) with the \'fast and easy latte art\' as demonstrated by Chef Shaun, and he personally prepared the coffee! \n<br />How much I wished for 1 now. Can\'t wait for D&amp;D to end, the week is too busy to handle.
Big fresh prawn is what I like the sauce also yummy just that u will smell like garlic when u finish dining. Whole restaurant air is from the kitchen
Just try food no drinks. Even for specialist tea or this purple drink taste funny. Didn\'t finish it for both orders
This OP Prime Rib is a delicious cut of meat, with a medium-rare interior and a lovely crust on the exterior, served along with Maldon sea salt, crushed black pepper and cajun at the side. Rich intense flavours with plenty of delicious fat marbling though it! Not forgetting Chef Shaun\'s secret spiced duck fat potato mousseline that was addictively good and was gone in seconds!
It was a perfectly al dente texture with a creamy consistency risotto, crowned with Japanese sashimi grade sea urchin and plump juicy roe on scallops. Chef Shaun also used Japan sea urchin paste and France sea urchin essences to stir into risotto to bring out the rich briny flavor of sea urchin. It was a mouthful of utter goodness, leaving a pleasant sweet and creamy flavour with a hint of saltiness lingered on my palate.
Really a hidden gem, lucky I know roads. Really nice the steak, juicy beef fantastic sauce and well served. Thanks guys for the nice experience and excepting the new menu. 
Steak that is cooked to perfection. Each piece was pink and tender, and extremely tantalizing. I would recommend ordering medium rare in order to fully appreciate the steak in all its juicy goodness. While the beef was flavorful on its own, the truffled mustard really took it to the next level. I mean, who doesn\'t like truffle aroma? The tart mustard also complimented the steak very well and brought out its flavor. I was swiping the plate towards the end to get every bit of the sauce. The side salad, as in most places, is complimentary and nothing special. I felt that the 200g portion was a little too small for me, although I wasn\'t keen on upgrading to the 400g option as that would cost a whopping $38. Still, I was impressed and would want to come back and try their other offerings. Priced at $21
I\'m still smirking over the darn good deal I found at The Betterfield  today. For $17.90 nett, I had a bowl of housemade tomato soup, a choice of cold fruit juice and a flavourful, juicy Australian Classic ribeye that\'s stunningly executed. Promotion is on till this Friday (9th Oct) so better go soon if you want some. Don\'t say \"bojio\"! üòÑ
Aussie wagyu with torched foie gras on top! As usual this place serves one of the best steaks in town! I\'d prefer my foie gras on the usual charcoal bread and berry compote though.
Hands down one of the best risotto I\'ve ever had. The risotto has captured in all the essence of the prawn stock plus it\'s creamy base making it so divine. Every single grain is so delicious. The giant prawn itself also had a firm and flavorful flesh, so mouth-watering! \n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
Each bite of the wagyu was splendidly tender and the flavorful juice of the wagyu just burst out of the meat! Simply too delicious! One of the best I\'ve ever had, no wonder this place is so highly raved - Definitely worth every penny. \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
What a rapturous song this sings despite only having four components on the plate: A panfried foie gras that\'s creaminess personified, a slice of bread, a puddle of sauce and some tomatoes.\n<br />Now, that is no ordinary dough but a cushion of charcoal bread that\'s been rendered with drippings from the foie gras itself. The sweetness of the housemade berries sauce brings all that richness to a more even keel, so it never tips into \"jelak\" territory. And to refresh the palate, pop those delectable baby tomatoes for a truffle oil-laced surprise. Mmmmmmm... üòã
Even though it wasn\'t a Wagyu, this piece of ribeye from New Zealand turned out to be stupendous in the expert hands of Chef Shaun.\n<br />Beautifully flamed all over for a subtly crisp finish on the outside, the steak when sliced, revealed tantalising pinky-red meat that glistened with juices. What I saw was confirmed by what I tasted. This was medium rare perfection. 
Having carved out a reputation for very well-executed signatures like the French Duck Confit, Mushroom Risotto and Pulled Duck Burger, I am really pleased that Chef Shaun isn\'t resting on his laurels. Instead, he continues to create new reasons to keep his customers returning. A fine example is this \"Giant Prawn Risotto\", a soon-to-be-launched dish on his \"Secret Menu\" that is more than aptly named.\n<br />I have happily slurped up the yummy Prawn Risotto previously, so for me, this is an upgraded, upsized, everything-also-upped version of it. Aside from the XXL prawns which bowled me over with their super fresh, firm and very sweet succulence, every chewy grain of the risotto also packed intense flavours of prawn stock and rich Parmesan. I thought the final act of torching the dish at the table was fun and interesting too.
Also from the Betterfield, it includes #risotto which tastes better than Concetto (lol) and has 3 huge tiger #prawns inside. $20 nett. \n<br />Speaking about food, Indonesia is holding their annual mass BBQ again. \n<br />#burpple
Already lost count on the number of times I visited The Betterfield but this is a must order whenever I\'m there. Plump meaty mushrooms and arborio rice cooked in his secret broth and it is cooked perfectly al dente, with each grain offering a little resistance to your teeth. It is given a rich boost with the addition of truffle oil and Parmesan. For those who has the NOM\'S (@nomnom.sg) membership card, you will be glad to know that you will be entitled to 10% off the total bill at The Betterfield.
It costs $21 for a sinful serving of duck meat with melt in your mouth duck fat. Pair the meat with sweet jam on the side to taste the mix of both flavours. \n<br />It went well above my expectations. üòâüëç\n<br />#duck #cafehopping #burpple
Another delicacy served by chef Shaun was this awesome plate of popcorn chicken sat on a pool of mentaiko sauce. My fren who worked in the food industry was surprised that the popcorn chicken was freshly fried and of top quality! Personally I liked the mentaiko sauce so much that I ate the rest of my meal dipping even my pasta into that delicious sauce üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
nothing else but medium-rare baby! very well-flavoured steak at an affordable price! one of the best steaks I\'ve had in recent times heehee can\'t wait for my next visit soon! üòõ
duck confit w roasted potatoes and berry compote! love the thick layer of fats beneath its super crispy skin! pretty decent food. I\'ll be back again to try their risotto! üòä #burpple
Featuring the foie gras atop of charcoal bun ($16.90), this will be available on all 4 nights. the pan seared foie gras was masterfully executed with an almost melt-in-your-mouth texture. the rich and creamy foie gras came with a lightly crisp layer.\n<br />paired it together with the house-special charcoal bun with a crust so crunchy that you can hear it break under the fork and knife as you cut. dipped into the sweet berry accompaniments as they marry well with each other.\n<br />lastly, don\'t forget that there is truffled tomatoes to tease your tastebuds!
that was how i came to have this plate of squid ink risotto which you will not see on the normal menu handed to customers. for those who have visited @thebetterfield before, you might know that chef shaun\'s risotto dishes do not disappoint and are always very well executed: think perfectly textured arborio rice forming the creamy risotto, now coated with squid ink imported from france. hidden underneath that beautiful black mess are generous servings of tiger prawns, deshelled for your convenience. when i spoke to chef shaun the last time, he was sharing about how he wanted @thebetterfield to be the place where students could paktor and that explains his low pricing despite the high quality of his food. people say that most school couples start dating or getting together start during the beginning of the school term, especially immediately after orientation. so for students looking for a place to paktor, especially smu lovebirds, @thebetterfield is located right next to the coffee shop that sells the famous waterloo chicken rice. \n<br />p.s. If you\'re worried about your date looking at your squid ink stained teeth and/or tongue, fret not as it washes off easily with a mouthful of water. \n<br />#burpple
because real men devour 600g medium rare ribeye. manlier when you keep your wallet safe at only $50. hoorah!
The duck skin was great, full of fat and so delicately light and crisp. The meat was pretty much fall off the bone, but I prefer a less dried out meat as it seemed like it was well on its way to being a jerky. The berry compote was on point, helping to cut through the fattiness of the duck, and making the meat more moist and palatable. The mushroom had a very strong garlic presence which I didn\'t particularly enjoy. Would be better if there were potatoes to make it a more substantial meal. Priced at $21.
Prawns were fresh but not well seasoned. I don\'t know if that was intentional because of the heavy seasoning of the pasta but it kinda irked me that the natural sweetness of the prawns were not brought out. The furikake was splendid, bringing a nice seaweed fragrance to the pasta. The bits of chorizo added a nice touch to the somewhat monotonous dish. The pasta was also very oily, which was okay to me but I imagine many people won\'t like that. The set lunch applies only for spaghetti and is priced at $17.90, inclusive of a very nice tomato soup and Peel Fresh fruit juice of your choice.
A little of this thick black squid ink paste, imparted a dark, glossy sheen that covers every grain of rice. The raw egg definitely brings a unique element to the dish too, by mixing it up with the risotto to heighten the flavor and texture. Chef Shaun is using squid ink paste from France, which is not as fishy as one might expect and had a pleasantly briny taste that works naturally with the creaminess of risotto rice. It was cooked perfectly al dente, with each grain offering a little resistance to your teeth.
The reviews for this beef is accurate as it was done really nicely (we asked for a medium rare, I think). Each piece was nice and tender, packing enough flavour. And if you wanted a more intense flavour, look no further than the truffle mayonnaise to complement the meat. If you have a craving for some good beef and don\'t want to blow your pocket, head to the Betterfield for this awesome dish :)
I used to think that the Betterfield was overrated because of the crazy number of reviews and the (to me) mediocre Thai chili chicken wings, but this plate of risotto silenced my critics, it is simply sublime. From the crisp spinach, to the thick broth, to the flavorful butter mushrooms, and grainy italian rice, this gives top restaurants a run for their money. I haven\'t had good risotto in a long time but I think this can definitely compete with the ones you get at Prego! Congratulations to Chef Shaun on his quiet abode which boasts a fantastic menu - Â•ΩÊñô indeed. Look out for a fresh new menu with new items in a few months time!
The Betterfield started popping up on my Instagram feed one day and boy, did the food look good! Always one to fall prey to a well done duck confit, I grabbed a friend and headed right down. Chef Shaun was very friendly but kindly denied us when we questioned about his \'secret menu\'. He did recommend his Duck Confit and Mentaiko Prawn Pasta though which came pretty as a picture and lived up to the hype. Of note was the super crispy skin on the duck that I would gladly buy a tub of to clean off while watching Netflix on a lazy evening. Overall food was good but drinks are kinda pricey, also wish the aircon was cooler but will definitely be back with more friends to attack his famous beef steak!
(So is the last few minutes of free data üòÇ) Guess it\'s a really fruitful holiday for me.... got many work done (eg. Tuitions and postings) and also finally got out for some shopping üòÜ also caught up with my friends and of course had many many good food! üòäüòäüòä Pictured here is the heavenly Foie Gras on Charcoal Bread that was strictly off menu but got a taste of it thanks to @larvitar which literally brought me, @thepoppingone &amp; @kunhongg2g to heaven üëºüëºüëº All the best to Poh Peng and his start of year 2!! And it was good working with you hehe! And also to Mila Kunis who is leaving this week üò¢ have fun in üçÅ
This was SO delish, so filled with the umami of prawn broth!
The squid ink is surprisingly pleasant and mild, imparting its beautiful colour that covers every strand of spaghetti. The flavor itself reminiscent of the sea that is not overpowering with the fishy aftertaste, well complemented with juicy succulent giant prawns. The raw egg definitely brings a unique element to the dish too, by mixing it up with the pasta to heighten the flavor and texture. This is off from \"The Betterfield\" menu but you can still order this with Chef Shaun if you like to have it.
Theft is a crime!\" No one shall steal my juicy succulent prawns in my prawn risotto [$20].
The risotto was fragrant and quite nice. I also ordered Serendipity (lavender+honey ice tea: $6) but it was diluted, and for the price it\'s not worth it. I had lemon merengue tart which was very hard. Probably they made it a few days ago.  The cafe is small n cozy but can get very noisy. 
Made with specially imported fowl from France, the fork-tender meat and berry compote come together in perfect harmony. Pair it with a glass of pinot noir for a fuss-free gastronomical experience #nofilter #wewantsugar
At $21 for 200g and no added gst/service charge, this is definitely value for money! Especially loved the truffled mustard that went brilliantly well with the steak.
I must have gotten my expectations too high after reading so many positive reviews on this dish. While it is undeniably decent, it\'s not exactly something I would come back for again.
Could probably do with a teeny wee bit more salt, but I enjoyed this anyway. It was bursting with the earthy taste of mushrooms and I liked how the pasta was cooked slightly past al dente.
I\'ve heard endless reviews of this plate of Prawn Risotto from fellow Tastemakers @juliuslim @rainraineataway and I knew I had to try it the next time I come. It was just insane. The prawn broth was so so strong, I almost thought I was having prawn bisque soup! Of course, the taste was evened out with the creamy base, which comes out to be quite a tantalizing treat. And kudos to Chef Shaun for putting in the effort to deshell the prawns, making it an even more fuss free dining experience (: 
Another hot favourite for the night! Loved the crispy outside, tender insides, without the greasy oil which makes you feel so so guilty. The thai Chilli sauce spin-off is refreshing with the extra herbs and insanely addictive!
Look no further for decent steak at affordable price. The betterfield is the place for you! Medium steak with meat in sheer red and each bite nicely done. Meat stays juicy and tender with the ends just a tad chewy. But overall it\'s worth the nett price paid for! 
Tiger prawns, arborio rice, grana padano, butter and garlic. A perfectly executed dish by The Betterfield. The consistency of the arborio rice and thick flavourful broth were amazing. I may not have a deep passion for prawns, but this is a truly passionate food affair. Easily one of the best risottos in Singapore.
Watch as the avid risotto fan gets her greedy hands on this of tiger prawns, garlic butter, grana padano with arborio rice!
First of all this Dish is not on the menu. I had accompanied a colleague for his special meal and this was one of the best foie gras I ever ate in my life. As a poor chap, I was never able to afford food of such high standard, so many thanks to @larvitar for sharing this. The charcoal bun is made with the chef\'s secret formula with a private bakery, it had the unique texture that compliments the fatty juices so well such that it was both wet and crispy. The owner/chef also mentioned that he would be bringing in a new dish with foie gras but of course he can\'t possibly sell a $50 plus dollars foie gras at $20, hence it would be of a lower quality. Nevertheless, I will definitely be back to try it out. #tryalltheirfood #conquerthebetterfield 
Succulent and fresh tiger prawns of this dish nailed it. The juices from the prawn head were intensively good! The spaghetti can get a little salty after a while but all it took was the cranberry juice which helped to reset the taste! The furikake seaweed went well with the pasta, chorizo sausage was well sliced and not too thick! Must try for pasta lovers! $20 for the pasta, got it at $17.90 in a set meal with appetizer and a fruit juice! 
Thanks to fellow intern @kunhong, we got the best of both worlds. We ordered two different pastas and decided to share them 50-50. The truffle was just too amazing, despite eating mouthfuls again and again, it wasn\'t overwhelming. I secretly wished the mushrooms were of larger slices as each slice packed a great deal of flavor! The photo doesn\'t do justice to the pasta, it was creamy and the kind of creamy that I personally enjoy; a smooth taste yet not too oily. I am already looking forward to my next visit to this place to try out their other delicacies! üòãüòãüòã
It comes out glistening, deeply colored, and slightly translucent that looks almost raw, yet it has a melty tender texture that is full of flavours. Served together with honey mustard sauce that complement the fresh delicate flavour of the salmon. This is salmon at its best and I can‚Äôt think of a better way to prepare salmon!
Chef Shaun\'s very own #SG50 creation is a must-have for any durian lover. You will probably see a version 2.0 of this delectable dessert on the menu very soon! #nofilter
An incredibly difficult dish to execute, yet Chef Shaun rises to the occasion. This may very well be his magnum opus, and I dare say that it\'s my best gastronomic experience of 2015 #nofilter
this is my first time trying slow baked salmon that neither taste like confit nor sashimi. at first glance, it appeared to be translucent, as if it was still rare. once I have tried it, the meat was smooth and silky with delicate flavor. texture was sublime and incredibly tender. the honey mustard adds flavor to it, complementing the freshness of the salmon without overwhelming the taste. I was so impressed with this dish! \n<br />thanks @thebetterfield for inviting the few of us and showcasing 1/4 of your amazing skills yesterday!
This delicate pan seared foie gras had a rich flavor and smooth creamy texture that just melted in my mouth, served with charcoal bun toasted in the foie gras fats that rendered while searing. The tangy of the berry compote provided good contrast and it balanced out the richness of the foie gras, with the truffled cherry tomato as the finishing touch to elevate your appetizer.
Another one of Chef Shaun\'s secret hidden weapons is the the 42 Degrees Celsius Slow-Baked Salmon, which is the best dish of the night. Served with honey mustard sauce, this dish is the true test of a chef\'s skills and patience. A very technical and time consuming process to ensure that the temperature stays at 42 degrees celsius so that the fish is not under or overcooked. The final product is an excellent cut of fish that breaks apart easily with a fork and the salmon literally melts in your mouth. Truly honored to be able to try a slow-baked salmon that is usually not served elsewhere due to the tedious effort required in the cooking process. Please note that this dish is strictly off the menu.
The first words that came to mind were decadent, luxurious and melts-in-your-mouth explosion. Chef Shaun surely knows how to pamper his guests as he serves his best-kept secret weapons during this private hosting. The pan seared foie gras was buttery and delicate, sitting atop a slice of charcoal bun that was toasted on the fats rendered from the searing. To cut through the rich flavours of the foie gras, a berry compote sauce was recommended to pair with it. To add the finishing touch, truffle cherry tomatoes were added into the mix to alleviate the classiness of the dish. Please note that this dish is strictly off the menu for now.
This would be my top excuse to come back here. The thai chilli sauce was such a bomb in addition to the well-marinated pulled duck. It was a massive explosion of flavours in my mouth.
I have lost count on the number of times I have visited The BetterField, maybe 5 or 6 visits? The reasons I keep going back is because of the excellent food at affordable prices, cooked by a talented, humble and friendly chef, who makes the effort to mingle with his customers and receive feedback for improvements. During my last visit, chef has revamped his menu and introduced several new items from the previous and one of them was the Prawn Risotto ($20). I tried making risotto before and it was a very tedious and laborious process, in addition to the expensive dry and fresh ingredients that were required. The skills of the chef are very evident in the execution of the risotto as the arborio rice was cooked to perfection and prawns were not overcooked. Within minutes, I wiped clean the plate.
Wiping mentaiko off the plate with crumbly bits of charcoal bun -- super sinful. Of course this dish tastes good but it doesn\'t take much culinary skill...
Pretty heavy dish which didn\'t manage to keep my tastebuds interested till the finish. 
angus ribeye today was slightly medium rare to rare today but no matter, each bite gets missus\' approval and nodding away. mission accomplished at $18. always great to have chef shaun checking on our food and feedback. my pleasure recommending folks to dine at betterfield!
because cousin went at my recommendation and he liked it. so here\'s another throwback. $20 wallet friendly duck confit at betterfield. sweet berry compote contrasted well with duck savoriness. while i foresee better tasting duck confit elsewhere, can\'t stress enough the $20 for the generous serving
Great truffle essence and crunchiness of freshly fried fries. #burpple #trufflefries
The group gladly lapped up every drop of the mentaiko #burpple #mentaiko
4.5 munchies: The tender and moist pulled duck became the star element of the dish only after being complemented by the sweet and spicy, coriander-infused Thai chilli sauce. The signature Chef Shaun\'s Thai chilli sauce, which none of us could get enough of, is also used for the Secret Thai Chilli Chicken in my earlier post.
Any place that bothers to make their own pesto already gets me excited. The Betterfield cafe goes one step further by putting a spin on things with their own take using coriander. When the pasta and mushrooms are cooked in this unique pesto sauce along with garlic, shallots and parsley, the result is insanely aromatic. 
The five Tiger prawns, de-shelled but with their heads left on for extra oomph, were fresh and springy. Saturated in the goodness of the prawn stock, the Aborio rice grains were cooked to an enjoyable chewiness with the Italian hard cheese, Grana Padano.\n<br />Usually, I find risottos to be a bit one-dimensional and seldom finish my serving. However, I didn\'t have that problem with this. With so many facets of flavour, plus the addition of baby spinach and fresh parsley, my tastebuds never got bored.\n<br />And just so you know, Chef Shaun cooks each plate of risotto individually upon order. So yes, you might need to wait a little but when the plate arrives, smelling so heavenly, you know it\'s worth it. 
Tidily Frenched duck leg cooked to juicy perfection, served with spinach, berry compote, mushroom fricassee and roast potatoes.
It was pretty tasty and you can taste the sweetness from the prawns that makes a perfect complement of the risotto, even though the rice was a bit starchy that day. It was definitely a blend of goodness and taste in your mouth!
The juicy tiger prawns with rich flavoured arborio rice is a great combination. Can\'t wait to be back to try the other food items. Though it was quite rush, it was great to be able to meet up with the rest. And thanks Chef Shaun for hosting us even when you\'re sick.
The BetterField is an unassuming caf√© that serves some pretty kick-ass food, and the Black Angus Ribeye is one dish that would be a sin to miss, if you love meat. It\'s very simply done ‚Äì seasoned with salt and pepper and \"pan-seared for an impeccable crust\", as Tastemaker Rachel Xie puts it ‚Äì but more than delivers in taste. It\'s juicy, tender, flavourful and everything you could ever want in a steak. At just $20 for 200g (but also served in portions of 400g and 600g), this steak will definitely sate your carnivorous cravings without burning a hole in your wallet.

Always feel so happy when is time to eat! How about something to start with from The Betterfield new menu?
The recipe to the punchy Thai chilli sauce smothering juicy deep-fried wings here might be highly classified info, but that doesn\'t mean these irresistibly scrumptious wings should remain a secret. Everyone needs to know how good they are and come try them.
It is so sinful that once you started eating, you just won\'t stop until the plate is clean! Perfect for groups to share the calories!
New changes will be coming soon at The Betterfield, as their new menu will be launching soon on Vesak Day, 1st June onwards.
Haven\'t had fried food in such a long time cause it\'s unhealthy and all, but we couldn\'t resist the thai chicken wings offered at The BetterField. The wings stayed crisp throughout the meal and made for an excellent side. Absolutely loved the delicious thai chili sauce that generously coated every piece of fried chicken. If I absolutely had to pick a fault, it\'d be that the fried skin tasted more like an external crispy wrap, and the wings were super duper fatty.
Oh, just an amalgamation of some of my favourite goodies on a plate. *heavy breathing* üò∂ Chef Shaun, you\'re quite the genius, aren\'t you?
The Ultimate Truffle Fries - Crispy fries tossed in white truffle oil &amp; black truffle paste, topped with shredded Grana Padano cheese, dried parsley &amp; a sprinkle of white truffle salt.
This came highly recommended. My favourite sweet Thai chili sauce but with a whole lot of other things. Very tender and juicy, relatively crunchy though it\'s not as crisp as I\'d have liked, but still enjoyable.
Got the lunch set which comes with soup and drink, was told this would be a smaller portion than ordering from the main menu. The portion was just right for me though. Not the best as some parts of the duck were on the drier side, but the skin was nicely crisped. The berry compote was a nice touch and I loved the mushroom fricasse!
Finally found time and made my way down after all the reviews! Had it medium rare, simply seasoned with salt and black pepper but it was pretty damn good at $20. And the little smear of truffle mustard on the side was quite light, bringing a little more flavour.
Can\'t stop dreaming about all the delicious food we tried last week. Thanks to hand model @rachelxie. (‡πë¬Ø‚ó°¬Ø‡πë)
Pictured here are elements of peanut butter, key lime, matcha, sea salt, maple syrup, and chocolate. Lots of chocolate. No prizes for guessing which cake is my pick.
Umami with a slight nudge of spice, this is one flavourful plate of fusion pasta, indeed. My only gripes: the too-short strands of spaghetti, which were also far too oily for my liking.
Never a dull moment when you are with the company of such great friends and also to celebrate a not-so-secret birthday dinner. Went back to The Betterfield and as usual the food didn\'t disappoint. Stay tuned for more updates as Chef Shuan unveils his revamped menu to the public in June! 
Having dessert cravings before dinner. &gt;.
Golden Fries with parsley, white truffle oil, black truffle paste, white truffle salt and Grana Padano cheese‚Ä¶ yum!
according to chef shaun, this is his signature dish and it definitely did not disappoint me at the #burpple eatup. priced at $20, it is more  expensive than saveur but the duck confit here is on a different level. chef shaun specially imports the duck from france. crispy golden brown skin, juicy fat, moist succulent flesh that falls off the bone easily. i\'m not sure if any other places in singapore serve it with a berry compote but i have yet to come across any. further accompanied by a mushroom fricasse prepared in-house, roasted potatoes and fresh baby spinach, i think that chef shaun has found a winning combination. probably the most value-for-money duck confit in singapore and my gut feeling tells me that @thebetterfield might become the new go-to place for a consistently comforting plate of duck confit.
Spaghetti with prawns &amp; chorizo, sprinkled with furikake (dry Japanese seasoning) &amp; dried parsley. A fusion pasta where east meets west.
Remember to order this a day in advance! My personal favourites are the sea salt caramel cheesecake, peanut butter chocolate cake, key lime tart. 
Probably my favourite from last night\'s @Burpple Tastemakers Eat-up ‚Äì Black Angus ribeye pan-seared for an impeccable crust, then finished in the oven to medium (or medium-rare, if you prefer) doneness. A sprinkling of cracked pepper and sea salt while the meat rests, a luscious smear of truffle mayo, and the steak is ready to be sliced, plated and served.
Succulent black angus ribeye. Hearty whole grain truffle mustard. Maldon sea salt mesclun salad.
I know I\'m going to be blessed with more good food in the coming year when The BetterField and the Burpple team surprised me with this amazing Birthday Platter from last night\'s Tastemakers\' eatup. My key picks are the Peanut Butter Chocolate, Key Lime Pie and Sea Salt Caramel Cheesecake. Thank you so much once again!
Yet another late night spent with the #burppletastemakers at @thebetterfield. Thought I couldn\'t make it for this one but luckily managed to squeeze through. Got to try a few new mysterious dishes yet to be launched, and had another go at the beef that haunts me ever since my first try. Great to have good food and good company for tonight in a place that I love. Hopefully the next one would not be too long!

your everyday thai chili sauce is first lavished with coriander and elevated with 8 secret spices before lathering onto fresh chicken mid wings. crispy batter is nicely done with an airy crunch that was neither dried out or hard while meat remains lovingly juicy. was definitely a crowd pleaser and a nice starter to our meal at the betterfield at yesterday\'s burrpletastemaker event. $14.50 for 8 pieces of joy.
Dessert Platter to end of the meal. Key Lime Pie was a winner for the really refreshing tart flavour with subtly sweet meringue which cleanses the palate, while the Chocolate Banana is a not too heavy on chocolate, yet carries a whiff of banana sweetness  to balance off the combination. Double Chocolate Pie was a pretty rich; would definitely hit off very well with chocolate lovers. The Sea Salt Caramel Cheesecake and Matcha Azuki Cake did not fare so well however; the former being a bit too light in flavour while the latter was rather dry and grainy somehow.
Can\'t decide if you prefer chocolate cake or cheesecake? Ever hope that there\'s an assortment of popular flavoured cakes so as to cater to everyone? The Betterfield has the answer as they introduced the Symphony of Assorted Cakes aka The Birthday Platter which has peanut butter chocolate, banana chocolate, double chocolate tart, matcha red bean, sea salt caramel cheesecake and key lime pie. 
The Betterfield is renowned for its quality and affordable fare but not many people know that they actually do serve pastries too. My favourite (quite straightforward) out of the lot has definitely got to be the Key Lime Pie which has a slight tang in the curd and buttery crust. There\'s definitely potential and room for improvement in the taste.
This is a new item on the menu - Furikake Prawn &amp; Chorizo. Dead excited to try!
Another one of the mystery dishes that got everyone guessing what it is. Despite it looking really similar to a laksa, this was a Japanese infusion involving Furikake, Prawn and Chorizo. There were clear umami flavours within the dish, and the pasta tossed al-dente. Prawn was pretty fresh; the only slight letdown was the tough chorizo which seemed a tad too dry. Gave feedback about it, and possibly would be improved before its launch in June.
Crispy duck skin and tender duck meat, what\'s not to love over an excellent plate of Duck Confit ($20)? Prepared only upon order, it\'s a tedious routine but Chef Shaun strongly adheres to that process. The supporting cast of spinach, mushroom fricassee, roasted potatoes and berry compote makes the entire dish deserving of a star award. You can clearly see the love and heart he puts into each dish.
Presenting to you the new menu item from last night\'s Burpple Tastemakers\' Eatup at The Betterfield. Honoured to be one of the first few people to have tried Chef Shaun\'s new pasta dish that has spaghetti with furikake, gigantic prawns and chorizo sausages. Thanks to Chef Shaun and Burpple for the great dinner! [Item will only be available in the menu from June onwards]
Third time here and had it three times. It\'s that steak that I would develop cravings for and need to make a visit down just to make sure it gets solved. At $20, no one does better ;)
Another one of the signatures at The Betterfield that I finally had a chance to try; the savoury flavours were brought down tastefully with the inclusion of Thai Chili which made it had a hint of sweetness to even out the salty flavours of the pulled duck, which comes between two toasted buns and fries. Pretty worth ordering!
We requested for more Thai chili sauce to pour all over the pulled duck, because it was that yummy. The charcoal bun tied everything together nicely, though I\'m not sure whether the edges were a little too well done for my taste! Pulled duck was done perfectly. Fries were average.
4.5 munchies: These addictive, well-marinated chicken wings and drumlets were so tender and juicy. I also could not get enough of the sweet and spicy, coriander-infused Thai chilli sauce drizzled on the crispy skin. The \"Secret\" in the Thai Chilli Chicken? Totally legit.
Crispy chicken wings dipped in Thai Chilli sauce that has over 9 spices inside, this would be great as beer food. The sauce is so addictive, and the chicken skin is not too floury or soggy from the sauce.
The secret lies in the special chilli which Chef Shaun mixes a symphony of 8 spices into the Thai chilli sauce, making it a secret weapon that goes well with anything. It\'s so addictive that you will not stop at one!
Chef Shaun mentioned that their Thai Chili is store bought, but he had included his secret 8 spices into the dish for a twist of flavours. It\'s crispy, juicy and yet had the signature flavours of Thai chili; sweet and spicy with a dash of coriander.
Upped to Version 4.0 and the second time I having this version after trying 3.0 once. Heard they had started to use Truffle Salt for the fries and changed the Truffle Paste for their mayo. Version 4.0 is the winner; Truffle flavour was evident throughout the fries and the shaved Parmesan was cheesy and brought out the truffle flavours well. Dip into the Truffle Mayo and it not only tastes of the creamy and eggy dip, it also enhances the flavours so well it\'s hard to stop!
4 munchies: Here\'s a sneak peak of the first mystery dish from last night\'s eatup. While the roasted potatoes had a luxurious taste from the rendered duck fat, the shredded duck was crispy and juicy as promised. Though I\'d have liked the taste of the truffle a little stronger in the mayonnaise and less of the gooey nacho cheese, this is the dish to order to kick start a hearty meal for any group setting at this cosy cafe.
Saw an image this morning and found it so true, \"Exercise? I thought you said extra fries.\" How can one not love some Ultimate Truffle Fries ($12)? Those golden fries with parsley, white truffle oil, black truffle paste, white truffle salt and some \"snow\" that\'s grana padano cheese will just make you want to reach out for more. 
One of the two mystery dishes served during the eatup. Pulled Duck meat was crispy and savoury, topped with Truffle Mayo while the Potatoes were saut√©ed well to crisp outside but maintained softness inside. Nacho cheese sauce was thick and cheesy; definitely helped in satisfying our cheese cravings. Very intense and sinful flavours not for the weak-hearted.
The other mystery menu item from last night\'s Burpple Tastemakers\' Eatup at The Betterfield! Thanks to Chef Shaun for letting us have the privilege to try his new creation of duck fat potatoes with crispy pulled duck, nacho cheese and truffle mayonnaise ($15). Absolutely sinful but stunningly satisfying. A dish worthy for sharing if you come as a group. [Item will only be available in the menu from June onwards]
charcoal is the new black and the relatively new cafe/bistro betterfield helmed by a very young and friendly chef shaun is right on track with his pulled duck burger served on jet black charcoal bun ($20). R&amp;D profusely with a local baker to make the bun, the end result was a glossy black stunning beauty that was uber crisp, breaking away and looking like seaweed crumbs on its own. otherwise, the bun bed did well soaking up the goodness from the tender savory pulled duck which was harmoniously tamed by sweet thai chili. guaranteed a great conversation piece from start till end while you devour the burger. also, now you have less to worry about bloating and flatulence because of the incendiary charcoal infused buns. how nice right!
I confess, this was my favourite sin at our #BurppleTastemakers eatup at #TheBetterfield. Yet to be made available on their menu, this \"mystery dish\" consists of duck fat potatoes with crispy duck, nacho cheese and truffle mayonnaise.
nothing is more sincere than a food cooked good and the desire to let the everyday you and me partake without burning a hole in the pocket. at betterfield, their freshly aussie flown black angus ribeye meant just that. steak was seared evenly before oven finished. sure the smokiness is less intense here I think but boy is that elusive medium rare steak sprinkled with black pepper and sea salt on bed of truffle mustard mayo a joy to behold.
throwback to previous #burppletastemakers session at the @thebetterfield. swimming in a pool of molten nacho cheese, a bed of more pronounced earthy flavored duck fat potatoes pairs lovingly with savory crispy pulled duck topped with truffled mayo. o so decadent but you know you won\'t stop till the plate is polished clean.
Off the meny, but all you have to do is just ask Shaun and he might be able to whip one up for you. Love the consistency achieved here; not too wet, not too dry. It\'s slightly grainier here but its due to the grains used here. Risotto was really flavourful with slight truffle aroma and the earthiness from the mushrooms, made very addictive with the shredded cheese atop that makes for that stringy cheese when melted. Also like how you could actually feel the mushrooms in the mouth because of the thickness it is being cut!
Most importantly, his dishes always never failed to impress me!
The O List
Off the menu and only on special occasions, Chef Shaun will whip up his secret weapon upon request. The Truffle Mushroom Risotto ($20) is one of the most affordable and mouthwatering risottos that you can find in Singapore. The aroma of the truffle oil, silky smooth mushroom pieces and rice cooked in his secret broth will make you wipe clean the plate in no time.
Back to The Betterfield for the Pulled Duck Burger ($20) and requested for more Secret Thai Chilli Sauce cause it\'s just so good. The sour spicy concoction elevates the meat to another level, making this dish a star attraction. 
One of the few places that I always recommend to my friends if they want good and affordable food would be The Betterfield. I love the Pulled Duck Burger ($20) so much that I can actually spam an extra serving of the Secret Thai Chilli Sauce in a go. Can\'t wait to see you all for the Burpple Tastemakers\' Eatup tonight! 
Guess we are always #foreverhungry and #forevergrowinghorizontally üòÇ who\'s with me? üôã 
This is the bomb. 600g for $50? Why! And how?! And the ribeye is done so perfectly (medium rare), just the way I love it, juicy and pink. With the slab so thick and so fresh, your tastebuds are screaming for more. And he is smart to have black truffle paste mixed into the the mustard, hitting well with the Singaporeans who are big on \"truffle-with-everything\". The steak is perfect with or without the mustard, depending on how your like it to be. Kudos to the chef with so much flaming passion. 
Duck Confit ($20) - Duck confit with golden fried crispy skin lying on a bed of spinach, saut√©ed mushroom and roasted potato, with berry compote at the side. It had the right tenderness of the meat with that salty crispy duck skin. It is just simply flavorful that u can taste the duck goodness in every bite of it!
Finally had the chance to have a meal at this burp-pular place! Steaks come in 200g/ 400g/ 600g option. Went medium rare and the meat blended well with the semi-honey mustardish tartar sauce (?). Enjoyed it and it\'ll be even better if they can slice the meat thinner. 
On a separate note, you can still enjoy 15% off all timepiece when you crack the code DwAlain at ·¥°·¥°·¥°.·¥Ö·¥Ä…¥…™·¥á ü·¥°·¥á ü ü…™…¥…¢·¥õ·¥è…¥.·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ç sale till 15 May 2015. Can\'t wait for the weekend to come.
- and got me thinking of the Mushroom Truffle Risotto($20NETT) that I had on my other visit that I had to ask discretely \"can I have the risotto? \" which I got to know that I actually couldn\'t have it unless I specially called in to order first. But I got lucky and the owner Shaun still made it for me! üòäüòäüòä 
Always feel so good to know new friends! Nice meeting u guys today üòäüòäüòä @juliuslim @rainrainegoaway
It\'s always great to meet up with new friends in the foodie community and share our good eats. It\'s also heartwarming to get an opportunity to speak to the chef and learn about the story that goes behind each dish. My favourite dishes from The Betterfield has got to be the Pulled Duck Burger ($20) and Secret Thai Chilli Chicken ($14.50). The zesty, refreshing and spicy Thai chilli concoction makes everything tastes better and will make you want more. And yes, I did not waste any and cleared most of the sauce on the plate.
Using blends from Dutch Colony Coffee Co for their coffee, their cuppa was pretty decent with its medium body and fruity flavour profile.
Another one of the more impressive dishes here at The Betterfield. Duck Confit came with a really crispy skin and the meat was so tender it came off the bone without effort. Berry Compote was a great balance of flavours without being overly sweet nor bearing a strong aftertaste, and the roasted potatoes and saut√©ed mushrooms despite a bit too peppery was a fresh change from the usual garden salads that would have came at the side.
Served warm and crisp, these fries came with a small whiff of truffle flavour and shaved Parmesan over the top. Truffle mayo also had light hints of truffle as well. 
Chewy and muscular beef that comes served with Mesculun salad and a honey mustard sauce at the side. Loved that thickly cut Black Angus Ribeye grilled with smoky flavours that we have requested to be done at medium rare (which was well-executed). So good that it does not actually need the honey mustard sauce which however was equally good as it comes perfumed in truffle aroma. One of the more affordable steaks that is really worth it\'s price tag at $20!
Currently in love with this starter dish at The Betterfield üòã Their homemade Thai chilli sauce of chilli padi, onions and coriander is the perfect balance of sweet and (just a touch) spicy, and absolutely delish.
Fatty and juicy beef slices that were cut nicely. The crust could have a stronger flavour but the mustard sauce more than made up for it. Salad could do with less vinaigrette. At $15 nett, I couldn\'t have asked for more. Definitely will be back to try more stuff! 
Saw @veronica\'s post on burpple, thought it was a deal not to be missed, and rushed to make a reservation before they run out of stock. However, this fell short of my expectations. The texture wasn\'t unlike a rougher cut of meat. But still, it was done to the right amount. 
- regretted the decision to have it at medium instead of medium rare as I couldn\'t taste a hint of bloodiness even at medium. I find that sour cream really went well with the steak, but it was good with or without it. The owner Shaun was humble and really friendly and enjoyed my visit today! They change their menu weekly so I\'m not sure whether this would still be available next week! #thanksburpple recommendations from @veronicaphua
Steak is best eaten hot and fresh. I ate 2/3 of this meat baby before I decided to take a picture. The steak is not as juicy and succulent as full-blood Japanese wagyu, but the fatty aroma and tenderness is enough to make my taste buds jump. Tender in the centre and slightly crispy on the outside. Close to perfect. And at $21?!! Not the best steak I have ever had, but definitely the most value for money!
Alas, it was not so for my experience- there was no marbling  and my steak was just tough and chewy for me. I couldn\'t believe it was even Wagyu. I had to double check with the waitress , if I had made a mistake in ordering. Well , unlike my first time at 18 Chefs yesterday where I also sent back their tough and chewy beef. At 18 Chefs , they were gracious and attended promptly to me. Not so here. Definitely the first and last visit for me. I\'m sure I would have had a far better dining experience across the road at Boulangerie Asanoya. üòè‚ú®üòü‚ú®üëé
Many of you should have seen pictures of the Better Field\'s Blackmore Wagyu on your Burpple or Instagram feed. After all, going at a mere $21, even I couldn\'t resist trying it. Also, fellow tastemakers and friends have given it rave reviews. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by my steak. The meat was a little too cold, overdone and dry at parts. Undeniably tender though, accompanied with truffle pesto, this dish had the potential of being as spectacular as what others described it to be. I suppose this is a problem that plagues many new establishments: achieving consistency at the beginning. Friends who ordered the same thing as me received a steak that turned out slightly different. I honestly hope that with time, the Better Field will indeed get better.
The Better Field is the new kid on the block, located just a few shops down from the famous Waterloo Street Leong Yeow Chicken Rice and Waterloo Times. This is The Ultimate Truffle Fries ($12): golden fries, parsley, white truffle oil, black truffle pesto, grade paciano. I couldn\'t really taste any truffle prior to dipping the fry into the truffle pesto but once I did, I couldn\'t stop myself from finishing the bowl. And as you can see from the picture, my friends quickly helped me to accomplish that task as well. Just be warned, the space here is small so it might be difficult to get a seat during peak hours.
Here is a sneak peek at the \"Mushroom Truffle Risotto\" from The Betterfield. For those who like meaty mushrooms and truffle oil, you should not miss this when it\'s launched. I think it\'s also really clever of the chef to throw in fresh spinach to punctuate the dish with texture while boosting its flavours. 
Had The BetterField‚Äôs Wagyu steak for dinner today, and I really enjoyed the warm service and value-for-money meal I experienced at this quaint little caf√© :) No, it was no Japanese Wagyu but it was hella good for it‚Äôs marble score. Come get some folks, before they remove this seasonal dish from their menu come 17 April!
The super addictive Secret Thai Chilli Chicken, loved how the sweet, spicy and tangy flavours all come together in a single bite
This outstanding dish is the result of painstaking work, attention to detail, and the finest ingredients. It\'s currently not available in the menu, but you might see it soon!
Essentially what happens after a very gregarious Mui Fan (ÁÉ©È•≠) who grew up on Sixth Avenue goes travelling in northern Italy and takes a ride on a Venetian gondola. The risotto rice grains are moist and distinctive and nicely absorb the prawn essence, which results in the risotto having a rather brothy feel. There is a slight whiff of truffle in the air, and the use of the more restrained grana padano cheese ensures things don‚Äôt get too cheesy. Even the prawns involved are fancy ‚Äì they are knotted stylishly even after death. 4/5
This wasn\'t my order but upon hearing the chef-owner state that there are eight types of ingredients that go into the making of the Thai-style chilli sauce, all of which are hand-cut to bring out their true essence, I was sold. Moreover, I know for a fact the meat in this burger with its stylish black charcoal buns will not disappoint as I\'ve already had the opportunity to feast upon the delectable duck confit as a main course. 
I was immediately drawn to the Salmon Mentai eggs benedict on the menu - very much enjoyed the crunchy yet soft charcoal bun, a pleasant surprise. Quite generous on the mentai, but a bit sad that one of the poached eggs was almost fully cooked. My friends had the what I think is called the fried duck salad which she really liked (I thought it was a tad oily but it was crispy and unique), and another had the truffled mushroom scrambled eggs which we all agreed was too garlicky. Truffle fries lacks the truffle taste/fragrance totally. However the food was good overall for us to want to visit again soon. #Burpple
Well.. These wings tasted like those we bought and fry on our own. Not bleah, but not worth the pennies.. You can DIY. 
The steak lunch set was pretty good value! Rest of the items were pretty good too! Items vary each week or so
Unites the best bits of both the Secret Thai Chilli Chicken and the Duck Confit from The Betterfield, with the other components being perfunctory window dressing. Despite looking here like something disgorged on the roadside after a night of reckless clubbing, I would gladly shovel said questionable clump into my mouth, because it tastes really quite fantastic. The chilli sauce is thick, limey, spicy and sweet all at once, and completely coats the juicy, tender and salty goodness that is the pulled duck. 4/5 
Situated in the Bras Basah area, The Betterfield offers truly fine dining quality fare in a relaxed bistro setting. The kitchen is helmed by a chef who has former experience working in several hotel and restaurant kitchens, and the years of experience is evident in the sheer quality of the food served. Try their brunch options such as Eggs Benedict, or their finger food options like truffle fries and their awesome Secret Thai Chilli Chicken.  For mains, go for the Duck Confit and the Black Angus Ribeye, which are irresistibly affordable at just $20 nett, yet taste better than equivalents which cost double elsewhere. This place is a true gem!
Made using beans from Dutch Colony Coffee Co., the Flat White ($5) here comes full bodied without being too acidic!
Very impressive Pulled Duck Burger - an original dish that boasts a unique medley of flavours, featuring tender duck confit meat doused in chef-owner Shaun\'s signature Thai Chilli Sauce. Will definitely be back for more!
A signature dish at The Betterfield, I found the Duck Confit really generous in size for the price tag. But more importantly, it tasted so good! Although the skin could be a touch crispier, it was still very delectable and the meat was tender and full of flavour. Complementing the savouriness perfectly was a lusciously sweet raspberry compote that\'s made in-house and a bed of baby spinach dressed with saut√©ed mushrooms and garlic. I have to say, I was really impressed by the young chef-owner\'s cooking on my first visit. Definitely returning for more soon üòÑ \n<br />#TheBetterfield #Betterfield #cafehoppingsg #cafesg #sgcafe #sgfood #instafoodsg #newlyopen #burpple
I can say quite definitively that this is the best duck confit I\'ve ever had. The duck skin is salty and wonderfully fatty, and once in the cavern of your mouth the fat instantly melts away in a way you wish your cellulite would. The duck meat is chewy and with each gnash of the teeth, the meat surrenders its seemingly endless supply of marvelously flavourful and salty juice. I barely even took note of the berry elements, being too busy enjoying every drop of duck goodness au naturel. Meanwhile, the mushroom fricassee and spinach are delicious and moist, and their fragrance somehow reminded me of Chinese cooking. Don\'t let the admittedly cafeteria-esque interior of The Betterfield mislead you - the chef is masterful, and this duck confit is a revelation. 4.6/5
At the soft launch of The Betterfield, a cafe-bistro concept that serves coffee and cafe fare. I preferred the Secret Thai Chilli Chicken - the sauce is thick, limey, spicy and sweet, and coats the chicken very nicely. 3.8/5

Loving the new spacious location! But I felt that the standard of the beef has dropped though :/ my beef was unevenly cooked - outside was slightly brown but inside was raw and chewy - had to bring it back to be cooked for a little longer. Meat was also a bit too beefy üòî my mom was saying that the cut of the beef was not very good so hopefully this was just an off day! Truffle mayo is as good as always though. -\n<br />HTW: 3 / 2 / 4 ‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #burppleSG #burppletastemaker #sgfood #foodforthought #eatoutsg #foodreviews #sgfoodreviews #heartytastyworthy #singaporeinsider #singaporeinsiders #sgmakandiary #couldbebetter #sgcafefood #sgcafe #cafehopping #tablesituation #bdaymeals
Loved this dish a lot! Risotto rice was done just right, and I love the seafood broth and the scallop bits. On a side note I like the taste and texture of the spinach which complements the risotto dish. \n<br />Note to self: ask for the Parmesan on the side; it made the dish taste cheap :/ -\n<br />HTW: 3.5 / 4 / 4 ‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #burppleSG #burppletastemaker #sgfood #foodforthought #eatoutsg #snapseed #foodreviews #sgfoodreviews #heartytastyworthy #singaporeinsider #singaporeinsiders #sgmakandiary #couldbebetter #sgcafefood #sgcafe #cafehopping #tablesituation #bdaymeals #sgig #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping #whati8today

Food is not bad, environment is clean and nice
Popcorn chicken with mentaiko sauce... Simply yummy 
slightly crispy skin. meat fall off the bone. goes well with the berry compote.
can\'t really taste the salted egg.
spices overload. the curry dip is pretty addictive.

Truffle fries $10
THIS IS HEAVEN! 
A marvellous entree to say the least. Pro tip: eat the cheddar tots with the scallop in one mouthful for maximum satisfaction üòõ
Why not head on over to @TheBetterfield\'s new nest, on High Street to check out their c√¥te de boeuf or other innovative dishes such as melted brie, curry cheese fries and salted egg tiger prawn spaghetti?
Worse cafe I\'ve been for a long long time. The service was damn bad. The staff are a batch of young kiddo without any experience. They look so lost the whole time. Food came separately one by one over the span of 30-60mins. Portions are small. Fresh orange juice taste like water. Never gonna come back again. 
TGIF folks
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />Here\'s Chef Shaun\'s {Cheese Curry Fries} with Japanese curry mayo to kick start the festivities // if you don\'t already know, @thebetterfield has moved to new premises near the Treasury with a seating capacity for 150, much better ventilation and extended hours of service
Coupled with the unique Japanese curry mayo dip, each bite promises an explosion of flavours. Warning: extremely addictive!
Visit the relocated @thebetterfield at: \n<br />The Treasury, 100 High Street #01-03 (S179434) to enjoy Omakase by Chef Shaun. C√¥te de B≈ìuf, available till 31st May. It\'s just $11/100gm.\n<br />Go go! Absolutely a MUST-TRY!
But, one look at the huge dining grounds and you would understand that staffing concerns and feeding the crowds at an efficient rate is a more outstanding issue

The aroma was pretty strong too as I could smell it before it arrived at the table. But the highlight (for me) is always the mushrooms, of course! üòÜ
Quite excited to visit them again after they relocate at the end of this month... üòä

It\'s all my favorites in one dish.
PB Reese\'s Chocolate Cake was HORRENDOUS. Got it for free because of the NOM\'s card (birthday month promotion) but it was the DRIEST cake I have ever tasted in my life. I believe it might be because the whole cake is sliced up into many slices &amp; kept on display like that - causing the slices to lose moisture. Or maybe it is just badly baked. Who knows... This was godawful.
Decent grilled steak charred just right. Very reasonably priced at $21. 
TEY\'s Riverine Ribeye! Woah, this few pieces of meat can pack a punch! Order medium rare, and was not disappointed. And just for $25.90 for such succulent beef. TOTALLY WORTH IT! 
All 400gm of it.

The fats on the side mixed with that HUGE piece of melt-in-your-mouth foie gras made my dayüòùüòùüòùbloody delicious.
Medium rare. Yums! Juicy, tender and fatty:)
Oh so satisfying. I can\'t wait to try their Wagyu beef üò≠
After digging in my first bite, I was truly impressed with this recipe that balances the flavours of capers, gerkin and tomato salsa to create the perfect bite. Lots of flavors going on with the white sauce that complemented well with the perfectly seasoned salmon, which will be a great start of the 3 course dinner menu exclusively for the Cafe Week at The Betterfield.
Very (too) flavourful I think. Mmm I miss Europe and its tasty but still very clean flavours üçΩ #vscosg #sgfood #sgcafehopping #burpple
The salmon comes out glistening, deeply colored, and slightly translucent that looks almost raw in the middle, yet it has a fork tender texture that is full of flavours. Served together with the goddess sauce that complement the fresh delicate flavour of the salmon. \n<br />Diners will be able to browse through the participating cafes menus on Nomnom‚Äôs website and make dining reservations. Diners can choose from either a brunch set menu (priced at $25 nett), a tea set menu (priced at $15 nett) or a dinner set menu (priced at $35 nett). Reservation period opens from 10 November onwards. NOM\'S members are entitled to priority booking from 6 November onwards. For more information, do visit cafeweek.sg!
It is well seasoned with a subtle hint of Cajun, accompanied with the flavourful juice sealed within it. It goes very well with Chef Shaun\'s secret spiced duck fat mousseline that is so rich buttery and addictive good! Beef lovers will definitely satisfied with the taste and the tender goodness of this ribeye!
If you want affordable and restaurant-quality fare, this is the place to go. What I recommend to order is the steak, duck confit, risotto, pasta, pulled duck burger... Okay, basically everything in the menu. If you are near the area, do drop by The Betterfield and be wowed by the food.
Good quality steak for $21
Stated big potato and duck with cheese. As photo the cheese is overall too much and too salty mixing with duck. Potato portion isn\'t enough for \"big potato\"
Like the taste of this pasta - like fusion of Japanese Italian style is small portion but good for sharing 
Will never visit again! Not recommended! Went there for dinner yesterday to celebrate my Bf birthday due to the good review but turn out to be Overrated review! The Wagyu is so so only. The portion is small as shown on the photo cost: $39.90NET. The duck confit is Average, same goes to the side: truffle fries &amp; sweet &amp; spicy chicken - Average. There is no service charge since everything is self service. The worst part of the dessert to end our day. Have u ever eat a melted lava cake with melted ice cream?! Too disappointed on the Molten Lava Cake, the waiter guy(wearing white shirt) serve us, he doesn\'t find anything is wrong with the cake &amp; ice cream. How bad is this service. -.-\" I should have just confronted the waiter but my bf said forget it that we shouldn\'t spoil the day. Well~ I just wasted my $11 just by eating chocolate cream? -.-\" Too Disappointed &amp; upset to even take photo. Thumbs down for overall! Goodbye BetterField, kindly do something about your service &amp; food. Be more observant. Nobody love melted lava cake &amp; ice cream. However thank you for food yesterday. Food: 2/5 Place: 2.5/5 Too cramp, very uncomfortable. Overall: 2/5
For $17.90 nett, I had a tomato soup, a cranberry juice and a flavourful, juicy Australian Classic ribeye that\'s stunningly executed. Promotion is on till this Friday (9th Oct) so better go soon if you some. #veronicaphuaeats #thebetterfield #thebetterfieldsg #burpple #sgcafe #cafesg #steak #sgfoodies #sgfood ##whati8today #instafoodsg #BurppleTastemaker
I\'m popped! Overwhelming bursts of flavors...
Poke the runny egg and mix the whole plate for a flavorgasm in the mouth! \n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
Beautifully flamed all over for a subtly crisp finish on the outside, the steak when sliced, revealed tantalising pinky-red meat that glistened with juices. What I saw was confirmed by what I tasted. This was medium rare perfection. \n<br />#veronicaphuaeats #steak #thebetterfield #thebetterfieldsg #burpple #sgcafe #cafesg #sgfoodies #sgfood #8Dayseat #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #sgeats #BurppleTastemaker

Very tasty meat!
Brilliant sear with a good crust constituting of coarse black pepper and coarse sea salt, the steak was delicious on its own but even better mopped thru that truffled mustard cream„ÄÇ

So forking friendly that knives are forking redundant. While the meat is so forking tender, you have to try the forking skin \'cos it\'s so forking crispy!
Yet another outstanding dish by Chef Shaun at @thebetterfield #nofilter #wewantsugar
Lunch set at $17.90 nett limited to just the pastas, with a soup and drink. We shared the Furikake, Prawn and Chorizo, Prawn Aglio Olio, and the Black Truffled Mushroom Cream which surprisingly turned out to be my favourite of them all. For someone who don\'t eat mushrooms at all. #thebetterfield #betterfield #waterloostreet #lunch #sgcafe #sgcafes #cafehunt #cafehop #cafehoppingsg #whati8today #burpple #openricesg #sgig #igsg #instasg #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #instafood #onthetable #foodphotography #foodstagram
Served with honey mustard sauce, this dish is the true test of a chef\'s skills and patience. A very technical and time consuming process to ensure that the temperature stays at 42 degrees celsius so that the fish is not under or overcooked. The final product is an excellent cut of fish that breaks apart easily with a fork and the salmon literally melts in your mouth. Truly honored to be able to try a slow-baked salmon that is usually not served elsewhere due to the tedious effort required in the cooking process. Please note that this dish is strictly off the menu.\n<br />|\n<br />Thanks @thebetterfield for the hosting.\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping
A most decadent dish skilfully executed by chef Shaun with his usual precision #nofilter
Chef Shaun surely knows how to pamper his guests as he serves his best-kept secret weapons during this private hosting. The pan seared foie gras was buttery and delicate, sitting atop a slice of charcoal bun that was toasted on the fats rendered from the searing. To cut through the rich flavours of the foie gras, a berry compote sauce was recommended to pair with it. To add the finishing touch, truffle cherry tomatoes were added into the mix to alleviate the classiness of the dish. Please note that this dish is strictly off the menu for now.\n<br />|\n<br />Thanks @thebetterfield for the hosting.\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

The reasons I keep going back is because of the excellent food at affordable prices, cooked by a talented, humble and friendly chef, who makes the effort to mingle with his customers and receive feedback for improvements. During my last visit, chef has revamped his menu and introduced several new items from the previous and one of them was the Prawn Risotto ($20). I tried making risotto before and it was a very tedious and laborious process, in addition to the expensive dry and fresh ingredients that were required. The skills of the chef are very evident in the execution of the risotto as the arborio rice was cooked to perfection and prawns were not overcooked. Within minutes, I wiped clean the plate.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

Juicy and tender with full flavour. #burpple
Finally got to taste the legendary Black Angus Ribeye and it was definitely fitting of its raving reviews ! #thebetterfield #beef #ribeye #sayhellojas #burpple
So sinful. So good.
Amazing value for its size at $50 nett!
Bun was crispy on the edges, just the way I like it. #PulledDuck was flavourful but found the texture a little too soggy. Nevertheless we still enjoyed this! Only wished the portion was bigger. üòú hehe.. #glutton #foodie #foodpic #foodporn #foodphotography #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #burpple

I thought you said extra fries.\" How can one not love some Ultimate Truffle Fries ($12)?

Prepared only upon order, it\'s a tedious routine but Chef Shaun strongly adheres to that process. The supporting cast of spinach, mushroom fricassee, roasted potatoes and berry compote makes the entire dish deserving of a star award. You can clearly see the love and heart he puts into each dish.
Thanks to Chef Shaun for letting us have the privilege to try his new creation of duck fat potatoes with crispy pulled duck, nacho cheese and truffle mayonnaise ($15). Absolutely sinful but stunningly satisfying. A dish worthy for sharing if you come as a group. [Item will only be available in the menu from June onwards]
Thank you, Chef Shaun, for hosting us with your high quality food, mystery dishes, and delectable Birthday Platter last night. And of course, the Burpple team for organising this May eatup!
Honoured to be one of the first few people to have tried Chef Shaun\'s new pasta dish that has spaghetti with furikake, gigantic prawns and chorizo sausages. Thanks to Chef Shaun and Burpple for the great dinner! [Item will only be available in the menu from June onwards]

Throwback to the #thai inspired tangy crispy wings we had at @thebetterfieldcafe . \n<br />Yummy good though oily.
The Truffle Mushroom Risotto ($20) is one of the most affordable and mouthwatering risottos that you can find in Singapore. The aroma of the truffle oil, silky smooth mushroom pieces and rice cooked in his secret broth will make you wipe clean the plate in no time. \n<br />#foodart #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #pickatsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #thebetterfield #cafehopping
The sour spicy concoction elevates the meat to another level, making this dish a star attraction. \n<br />#foodart #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #pickatsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #thebetterfield #cafehopping
Generous serving of Truffle fries with cheese. 
It\'s also heartwarming to get an opportunity to speak to the chef and learn about the story that goes behind each dish. My favourite dishes from The Betterfield has got to be the Pulled Duck Burger ($20) and Secret Thai Chilli Chicken ($14.50). The zesty, refreshing and spicy Thai chilli concoction makes everything tastes better and will make you want more. And yes, I did not waste any and cleared most of the sauce on the plate.
The chicken were coated with the chef\'s signature Thai Chilli sauce that is super addictive. You just can\'t stop and is finger licking good!

Luckily for me, my steak did arrive as medium rare &amp; taste pretty good too. My partner who ordered the same dish was not lucky though, more than half the steak is more towards medium rather more than medium rare. Would be good if chef can maintain consistency.
