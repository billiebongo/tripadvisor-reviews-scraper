Seem like whenever we head to hawker, I will end up ordering one plate. But it\'s great to introduce savoury fried carrot cake to oversea friends seeing how different it is from those dessert carrot cake. We had Lau Chen Carrot Cake &amp; Poh Piah the other day, their carrot cake was more nuah and we wish it has more wok hei to it.
Waking up to this cool and cloudy weather, I only craved for a warm bowl of porridge. The duck porridge is available at $3/ $4/ $5. Just go large and you won\'t regret paying just $5 for lots of duck meat hidden in this bowl of smooth porridge with thick and savory duck zup (gravy). üòç
Stir-fried bee hoon mixed with char kway teow, topped with fishcake and some greens. Enjoy these with the fragrance and crunchiness of the fried shallots. This plate of old school breakfast costs just $1.50! What a great makan start of this brand new year! üòã #cheapandgood
The ingredients are really fresh. I especially love the lean meat, fried fish and wanton! \n<br />Jian Bo Shui Kueh - 40cents each. I know I\'m abit lag but homg its soooo good! The chilli and chye poh was perfect. üòç #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #takemymoney #mybossiscoolerthanyours
The usual fried carrot cake you have comes stir fried with either sweet black sauce or plain, with eggs &amp; caipoh. But this version here is an oily, deep fried, crunchy pack of carrot cake sticks which is simple yet addictive. \n<br />It\'s tough to find stores selling this version of carrot cake these days as it isn\'t as popular as the usual one. As long as this store continues to sell it, I know I can always come back for more.
Decent comfort western food served on a hotplate. The sauce isn\'t one I\'d crave for and pork slices were on a thinner side but you can\'t complain when it\'s 5.50 yo
Perfect way to start the day especially in this rainy morning. So addictive that I had to have a second cup!
From stall #02-06. I thought it was rojak at first but the uncle sharing the table with me said this is not how rojak is typically prepared. So I looked it up and learned that this was actually tow kwar pop - tofu puffs stuffed with cucumber and turnips, served with pineapples and sweet-salty sauce, just like rojak. If you hate cucumber like I do, you can ask the uncle to not include it. I have this dish every time I go to Tiong Bahru Market.
Queued 15 mins for the famous #lormee178 that comes with fried shark nuggets. Just taste like fish to me though. But I love the sauce and the copious (self help) amount of garlic. #howtonotbefat #burrple
Best char kway teow I\'ve had at stall 02-11. Deep rich flavour and not too greasy.
My bowl of heaven.  Especially like the shark\'s meat nuggets.
Drawn by the fabulous homepage of this Hawker Center we visited it a little bit after the lunch time on a Saturday and I really enjoyed the depicted Bak Chor Mee üòã üôå üç≤! It shouldn\'t be the only stall we would try there, but the first is always memorable!
You know the people behind Harrianns are doing things right since they started way back in 1940s. The simple Kuih Kosuis here are evident testimonies, they were subtle and fragrant with each different flavor. They would do our nation/culture proud as ambassadors of our Kuehs beside the categorically similar yet with distinct difference: Japanese mochi and Korean rice cake representatives. \n<br />P.s: The glutinous rice that comes sweet or savory (or you could have a mix of both) is also a long time family favorite) \n
At SGD4 bucks! Stall just beside the washroom. Love spicy dry prawn noodle go for it! 
Laksa
Somehow this doesn\'t taste as good as I remembered it. Or perhaps everything does taste better when you ÊâìÂåÖ it back into camp during NS. The Chwee¬†Kueh was good though! :)
Oyster Omelette . Chee Cheong Fun
$5 but they give quite a sizable amount this round. Succulent relish pork! Yum!

A good bowl of tau suan for tuesday breakfast. #singaporefood #burpple
Lots of curry gravy on the rice with Pork Chop and Cabbage is so deliciously flavourful. Wanted to try the hot favourite Stall beside the Tiong  Bahru Centre. On seeing the queue,  we decided not.  Haha. The weather was too hot so we decided to settle with another Stall in the Tiong Bahru Centre instead. Not bad. Seems popular too but thought the meat in the pork chop should be more generous
At stall number #02-44 was this stall that sells both fishball ball noodles and Yong tau foo. It\'s peculiar mixture of the Yong tau foo soup and the fishball soup was what that made the food special. The ingredients were fresh and chili&amp; sweet sauce were also particularly good. Another chinese \"fusion\" food found in the hawker heaven, Tiong Bahru market. Shall try out their dry version next time! 
The boyfriend said the cook hit the chicken everyday that\'s why the meat is very tender!
It\'s #brunch timeüçùExploring &amp; hunting for local food on a #sundayüåè NOMNOMNOM.
Although this plate of Fried Hokkien Mee doesnt look like much, its one of my to-go dishes at Tiong Bahru Market. Their hokkien mee leans more towards the dry style, which i prefer over the other wetter versions. 
Super shiok crispy shao rou and char siew with a little burnt n crispy taste. Just the way I like Singaporean Char Siew Shao Rou Rice. 
Opening till late night, China Town Zhong Zhong Fine Spices (unsure if it\'s related to the Chinatown stall) sells Ngoh Hiang Prawn Crackers. Despite the fried bee hoon being sold out at the time of visit, this plate coughed up to around $10! The fried items were fried only slightly so some of the food items remained cold on the inside still.
dinner at tow kwar poh 02-06. stuffed bean sprouts, cucumber and grounded peanuts inside fried bean curd is as good as any salad at only $3. good on its own already but if you have to, just go easy with the prawn paste by the side and suggestively healthy you know. plus the grilling gave the tau pok a nice smokey taste!
80cents each for fine sweet red bean/ lotus paste within the soft hot steamed pauüòãüòãüòã
tenweekend had such lousy beef bowl at pho street, so i am glad this totally made up for it @ only $4.50. dons were fork tender, beef balls were not gamey at all and broth was a sweet lovely
Still one of the best dim sum stall in food centre. 
Haven\'t LOR MEEed for a long long time. Love the shark meat nuggets and vinegar buffet.
Good old trust worthy breakfast. Local traditional breakfast that you can get from food centre. Bringing back good memories 
Sin tong nam. Salty and sweet at the same time. You might not be used to it at your first bite but it grows on you.
The owner has both the pan fried versions and the steamed versions of the kueh. Filling are so so. Skin too thick for my liking.
Prefer their salted egg squids as compared to this. Prawns arent that worth it, $18 for this plate. Yet, the squids only cost $10. 
Rice flour cakes. Tasting the same since the 80s when I first had them at the V old Tiong Bahru market with zinc roofs. Chye Por still tastes as good and served in abundance unlike some other stalls today. Made up for my visit to the market today
Heard alot about this stall. Disappointed. The crux of Lor Mee is the gravy. Not the chilli. Not the fishcakes/pork or sharks meat nuggets. The gravy was bland. I prefer Waterloo St or Bukit Purmei anytime
Fried Oyster!
Fried Oyster!
Just want to take some time to thank mummies (and some daddies), mummies who queue from stall to stall to \'tabao\' favourite food for their children (who may be still sleeping at home). It\'s hot, it\'s sweaty, it a long wait. A parent\'s love &amp; patience is indeed admirable.
What makes Hui Ji\'s fishball noodles so good is their back to basics, rustic charm. At a mere $2.50 per bowl of handmade fishballs and noodles in delicious special sauce, it is undisputedly one of the most value-for-money hawker eats that provides both quantity and quality. Handmade fishballs. Addictively good chilli. Cripsy pork lard pieces. Need more convincing? 
Known for ridiculously flavourful and tender char siew because they use the armpit of the pig, this stall will leave you wanting second helpings. Nicely marbled and well marinated, the char siew sells out fast, and the best parts are obviously the charred bits. The noodles are thin, springy and tossed in slightly sweet and salty sauce. There are two types of char siew: Grade A &amp; Grade B, but you gotta go early if you want the premium cut!
Trademarks of good chwee kueh are the kueh, chye poh (preserved radish) and chilli. This simple dish can be hard to perfect but Jian Bo serves one of the best you can find. The kueh is smooth but still has a good bite to it, the chye poh is not overly salty, and the chilli is so very satisfying. It can get quite oily, but this dish is truly worth the calories once in a while, if the craving hits.
Red Ruby is my favourite local dessert! For the uninitiated, it is a simple dessert of shaved ice flavoured with syrup and coconut milk (or evaporated milk), and topped primarily with chewy, crunchy starch-coated water chestnut pieces. The dessert stall at Tiong Bahru Market is generous with its toppings and drizzling of syrup and milk, so naturally its ice desserts are much tastier than the average stall. We need more stalls like this!
One of the legend in Beef Noodles, this definitely speaks more than a thousand words on how awesome it is. 
Happiness can be found in the simplest things.
One of the better poh piahs, but 968 at Whampoa Drive is still the best for me.
At 7am in the morning, there is already a long queue for a taste of this old school Yong Tau Foo stall (which also has awesome fishball noodles with touch of sweet &amp; fish sauces). Appreciate these hawkers who wake up so early, dedicated to their craft, to provide us with a filling breakfast. Enjoy the week ahead everyone!
Very authentic elements with the mock meats not being overly sweet and the gravy having an excellent consistency. The added crunch of the vegetables was the icing on the cake. 
At tiong baru market with the long queue dry mee pok and thai lion kitchen salted yolk seafood fried rice.  But both unsatisfactory to our palettes.
$2 each) and Tiong Bahru Fried Kueh Teow ($2) for supper! My tummy is pretty much contented now üò¨ #rachfoodadventure #burpple
Beef balls noodles ($3.50/$4.50) 
Prawn noodles ($3.50/$4.50) 
Fishball noodle, char kway tiao, carrot cake and soya bean milk!!
feel its just nice and I like de thick gravy. only downside is that hawkers now use fried fish instead of the traditonal eggs and pork. have to scout for somewhere that has it.
Ah Behng! (Duck Rice; È∏≠È•≠) I just like the way it\'s pronounced in Hokkien. This is surprisingly nice. Sauce and soup a bit too salty though. From stall #02-43. #TiongBahruFoodMarket #lunch #nice #duckrice #latergram
How I got to meet Rui En yesterday, because we were craving for this bowl of Shark Meat Lor Mee and the pretty Rui En happened to be having her lunch at the market ;)
if u like rojak n tofu well n ur cutting back the guilt from too much bakchor mee..this is a healthier opt at the hawker center .. its warm grilled so its more comforting than eating salad .. new years resolutions to trim the love handles yo... err yeah rite
Good food need not be expensive nor be in a restaurant with air con
Am slightly upset that my fav Wanton Mee stall Hua Feng at Tiong Bahru market has closed! They are replaced by a new stall, also called Hua Feng. It is not bad, but just cannot replace the unique taste of the original http://danielfooddiary.com/2011/11/18/huafeng
Best food ever! Raw fish slices with fresh cut chili padi, lime, ginger &amp; lettuce ‚úåÔ∏è
Shanghai Xiao Long Bao!!! Original, Salted Yolk and cheese flavours. It\'s awesome value for money :D #dimsum #burpple  #yummy
Pretty tasty, but probably not worth the half hour wait at #02-30.
Excellent savoury gravy with shark nuggets. Never tried shark nuggets before. Owned by a friend\'s parents.
Simple and good. The char siew is one of my favourite - tender and not too sweet.
Gravy of lor mee is not too thick, just nice for my liking. The shark\'s meat (real shark\'s meat?) is crispy and fresh. I don\'t mind having this every week.
Featured in the Michelin Guide, receiving the Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2016 and 2017, it is the only Singapore version Hokkien Mee I will eat. üòãüòãüòã

.\n<br />Slightly bouncy yet not too firm, the steamed rice cakes have a soft texture and are mushy to the bite. The cakes are covered in generous heaps of deliciously tasty chai poh made even more pang with sesame seeds, and the fried shrimp in chilli oil gives a glistening smooth texture to the cakes. Eat with moderation, this dish can get pretty oily!!\n<br />_______________\n<br />Jian Bo Shui Kueh\n<br />Tiong Bahru Market #02-05\n<br />30 Seng Poh Road\n<br />Singapore 168898\n<br />.\n<br />#eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #dojoeats

A must order whenever you\'re at the Hawker Centre; albeit a long queue, it moves pretty quickly as the store helpers move &amp; scoop out the kuehs in a swift &amp; precise motion. \n<br />The cai po (preserved radish) comes dripping in oil, but that\'s the beauty of it - it helps to add flavour &amp; keep the moisture of the kueh, allowing it to sit out for awhile without becoming tough. \n<br />Throw on some sweet sambal chilli &amp; you\'ve got yourself a good kick, without killing your taste buds. ‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#BurppleTiongBahruMarket #Burpple #BurppleSG #aroundwithamd #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG

With all the necessary elements including chye sim which one can hardly find in ckt nowadays.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />This was well fried with just a gentle gentle hint of wokhei. If compared to another stall in the same market, I go for this one as it is moist and had a more distinctive char kway teow finish.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />In my haste, I forgot to take down the name but it is the stall closest and on the same side as the famous chwee kueh stall.
Craving for anything old school.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />This stall is manned by two elderly gentlemen. It was the name that caught my eye. Called simply \"Tau Kwar Pop\". There is green papaya strips, youtiao, taupok, cucumber, pineapples and jambu. I requested sauce to be separate so I could do my drip shot. Generous toppings of ground peanuts. I so loving this cos the taste is so simple and old school. Tangy sweet nutty with a delightful gooey prawn paste sauce.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Very refreshingly nostalgic flavors. We enjoyed it alot. If I should traipsed my way there again, this is a must order.\n<br />Stall name : Tau Kwar Pop\n<br />2nd level Tiong Bahru Hawker centre

Malaysian foodie on the loose. Seriously can\'t bring them anywhere. The Singaporean can\'t help but just smile shyly at her guest. Tsk tsk! | #foodie #malaysiaboleh #food #hawker #streetfood #vscocam #vscofood #sgig
So on Chinese New Year\'s Eve, what do workaholic Chinese eat for lunch? Malay food. I\'m so thankful Singapore is a multi-racial country #CNYEve #NothingButMalayFood #niceMeeSoto #lunch #TiongBahruFoodMarket #02-16 #BismillahWanMaemunah
Phad Thai. \n<br />I think the Thais are really geniuses by incorporating crushed peanuts into their dishes. #PhadThai #ThaiCuisine #lovepeanuts #IMissRatchathewiPhadThai #lunch #TiongBahruFoodMarket
Â§ßÂ∑¥Á™ëÈ≠öÂúÜËÇâËÑûÂÜ¨Á≤â (#02-50). Came all the way here and I end up eating something from Toa Payoh. Fascinated by the orange fish cake, resisted the urge to throw the fishball on the floor so as to see how high it\'ll bounce, and the uncle added Âí∏Ëèú to the soup which gives it a unique flavour. Best dish I\'ve eaten so far here for the past week. #fishball #vermicelli #firsttry #ToaPayoh #TiongBahruFoodMarket #yummy #ToaPayohFishballMincedMeatNoodle
Kway Chap from (#02-43). The one from Old Airport Road is still nicer #kwaychap #lunch #TiongBahruFoodMarket #IMissOldAirportRoad
Tiong Bahru Food Market is said to be one of the most famous hawker centre in Singapore. And the famous food blogger, Lady Iron Chef, claims that Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice (#02-82) is \"one of the best chicken rice stalls in Singapore\". Clearly overrated. It just tastes like any other chicken rice. So disappointing. At least it was cheap. #lunch #chickenrice #overrated #cheap #TiongBahruFoodMarket #firsttimehere #firsttry #finally #disappointed
