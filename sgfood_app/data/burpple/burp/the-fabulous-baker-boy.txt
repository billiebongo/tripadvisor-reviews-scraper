Really love the place decoration! The food is really good(: love this awesome simple pancake 
The egg is well poached and overall a nice dish. For $12.50!
It\'s not enough to just post what we ate, i feel it\'s best to show happy faces with happy food üòÉüòç
Champion breakfast and The Jacintha and of course an iced Mocha to beat the crazy heat.
Terrible service. Not many people when we went but the guy behind the cake counter gave us a bad seat. We suggested to change and he was quite reluctant to. When we decided to order order the cakes, he did not even look up to confirm the orders but immediately walked away to retrieve the cakes. No acknowledgement; nothing. Cakes were so-so, to be fair I prefer my cakes chilled. Anyway we won\'t be back here again. Fabulous baker boy? Not so. 
Starting my day right with these Apple Cider pancakes. These sorta rustic pancakes are my favourite. They may not look pretty nor instagram-worthy, but they promise the fluffiest, softest, cloudiest melt-in-your-mouth texture. 
Flat white came warm, not even hot. And where yo latte art üòï\n<br />|\n<br />Sigh can\'t stand the random bag on the floor which kinda ruined this pic lol. üòñ
This was another one of my favourites. The Greek yoghurt sponge was infused with lemon flavour which really took it to the next level. The sponge was crumbly, and not too dense. The blueberry jam complimented the zesty cake really well, while the cream cheese and Swiss meringue butter cream was light and creamy. The myriad of flavours really come together in perfect harmony with each bite. Mad love for this particular flavour  of theirs!
Came here again to try more cakes! Love the pastel coloured blueberry lemon yogurt cake. The combination of the lemon flavoured Greek yogurt sponge cake, blueberry jam and cream cheese was sweet and refreshing. My fav among these was the \'Mariah Carey\' cake. Made of brown sugar and rum sponge, cream cheese and roasted pecans, I kept my first mouthful in for a long time savouring the marriage of flavours. Probably cause any dessert with alcohol is a win in my books. What was disappointing was the fab red velvet cake. It was much more dense and nothing impressive as a whole.
This was quite a disappointment; the sponge was rather dense and heavy, and tasted more like normal chocolate cake as opposed to red velvet. The frosting didn\'t really add anything to it and was nothing special. I feel that this should be given a miss here since their other cakes are definitely way better. 
This place does cakes right, and this one was no exception. Dubbed the \'Mariah Carey\', this cake certainly is able to hold its weight as it namesake suggest. The brown sugar and rum sponge was moist and crumbly - it wasn\'t too dense and was actually quite light. The cream cheese frosting complimented the alcohol sponge really well, while the roasted pecans added a nice fragrance and texture to the cake. Definitely one of their best here!
Love the cheese plus the generous serving of beef! Only thing was that there was a bit too much bread haha.
Plus 4 more in the fridge beside it!
And I think I would only go back for the cakes and brunch. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio. Now go forth and eat cakes because it\'s the weekends!
üç∞\n<br />{Blueberry Lemon Yogurt cake x Strawberry Shortcake}\n<br />The former was a tad sweeter than I\'d hoped for but I love the flavours! (And the intriguing shade of blue hahaha.) The latter was good too as it\'s light and fluffy and paired with cream cheese frosting. Ah now I just wanna go back and try the other cakes! üòã
New on the dinner menu: a hulk of juicy beef seasoned with coarse ground black pepper, served with fries and a side salad.
Look out for The Fabulous Baker Boy and their newly revamped dinner menu!  Some hits and misses but nothing cannot be fixed by their delicious delicious cakes.
Who doesn\'t love a juicy meatball coated in lipsmacking cheese sauce? If you don\'t, you must be leading a very loveless life. Cue judgey face.
Despite the carrot cake seemingly wearing a highly avant garde and fashionable carcass of a deceased bird on its back, it tastes extraordinarily masculine. The coconut shavings were the most memorable bits, all rough and gnaw-gnaw-gnaw in your mouth. The carrot cake itself was dense and nutty, and so filling it can feed eight girls with thigh gaps. 3.5/5
A cake so dense, filling and statuesque that it can probably serve six girls with thigh gaps. Fork vertically and the lemon emulsion essentially overrides everything else; try only the sponge bits and you enjoy the highly distinct and aromatic perfume of earl grey; swipe a bit of the purple cream and you get the faintest tinge of buttery blueberry. 3.8/5
The cakes here are really well made - crumbly and moist. Really loved the white chocolate raspberry. Perfect balance of sweet and slight tartness from the fruit. The pandan was good too - mild natural fragrance of pandan together with the light cream cheese frosting, yummy! They have a wide variety of cakes here and they all look so good, would definitely come back again to try more!
The egg benedict is very yummy! You can add bacon or anything else if you want. Love this for brunch! Don\'t forget, they close on Mondays! Price: $15+
It\'s good but got a slight \'huat kueh\' initial taste üò≥
Love the ambience, the beautiful display of cakes! The salted caramel cake could do with a bit more caramel kick; the lemon raspberry grows on you and the chocolate red velvet was a definite winner - moist and light! Will be back to try the brunch menu! Service is great too!:)
Great cakes! Not too sweet, moist and good serving size. They also serve desserts like panna cottas and pies! Surely coming back for more! 
Since I\'m really not a huge fan of truffle oil, I was so pleased to see one with garlic on the menu! No worries truffle lovers it comes with a truffle complement on the side.
Was certainly not expecting this mammoth of a tartine. Couldn\'t finish it even though I absolutely loved the crispy toast smothered under chunky tuna and onion mayo with a blanket of melted cheese. Definitely recommended for two to share. 
With grated Parmesan cheese and served with spicy pasata sauce. ($10.50)
Gryphon artisan tea. Incredibly fragrant with a beautiful flavor that lingers in your mouth with every sip. $5
Tried tier dinner menu and really. Very dish came out really delicious. Avg $27/pax. 
Red Velvet cake. And lemon vanilla raspberry cake. Both cakes were very moist and tasty. üòãüëç
Simple looking dish but surprisingly the taste is good. Can try :)
I wouldnt eat it with honey, but the chicken tastes superb! Just without the honey would be 10/10. Give it a 8.5/10
Known for their gorgeous HUGE cakes, The Fabulous Baker Boy is simply fabulous. Dig into their sinfully rich, chocolate covered Red Velvet cake with a cup of coffee. Set in The Foothills, it\'s a nice place to relax with a couple of friends on a lazy afternoon. We suggest that you share a few slices, but hey, sometimes it\'s alright to be selfish.
Potatoes was nice. Felt like Popeye when eating the spinach on toast with eggs - missing meat and variety at this price. Flat white was weak and sour.
Salty and got quite jelat after a couple of bites. Paired this with cappuccino - the white cap was not visually appealing and the coffee was sourish.
Fabulous Baker Boy. Fabulously moist and paired with a smooth, tangy cream cheese frosting, FBB is my gold standard for carrot cake. The apple cider cake is a bit lackluster though, because I couldn\'t taste any hint of apple nor cider. That said, the cake and frosting were delicious...just not apple cider-ish.
Loving this refreshing taste regardless of how many cafes i\'ve been to. 
I had the Valrhona Ivoire Raspberry Cream Cake at the Fabulous Baker Boy over at The Foothills for tea and I\'d just like to say that I had such pretty flavours in my mouth. Pretty to look at, prettier to consume.
The pasta didn\'t taste as good // Score for the poached eggs on toasted brioche; was really yummy!! // Good fries with fair amount of garlic slurpsss!
Moist sponge cake with cream cheese filling coated with an outer layer of choc. Surprisingly it isn too sweet..  Yummy =)
I had the lemon coconut cake and it was delish, I love love love the ambience here 
Now I know why they are famous for their brunch, these eggs are the bomb! The inside is just nicely half cooked!
No wonder a fav here, cake is moist and flavourful but not over powering!
The cake slices were so big I was full after eating mine! Featuring the famous red velvet cake &amp; the lemon vanilla cake (I forgot its name)
Red velvet ($9) - chocolatey enough and yet not too sweet. üëçüëç hummingbird ($9) - tasted like some kinda ordinary banana cake to me and a little too sweet. Didn\'t taste any pecan at all except for the one on top. Mehhh. Carrot cake ($8.5) - cheapest of them all but it was my favourite!!!! Absolutely love all those coconut shavings I literally polish them off, clean. I think it was walnuts in them cake, so yummy along with the raisins. Hehehe love it. üëçüëç
TFBB champion breakfast with chicken sausage ($24) - comprises of eggs ben, some beef, roasted potatoes, mushrooms. Portion was just right and it tasted decent. Jus Prawn Pasta ($20) - I kinda like this. Not too heavy on the palette. It\'s like tomato and carbonara sauce mixed together, I kinda like it. Prawns were fresh as well. Apple cider pancakes ($11) - good taste (but I still like CMCR ones better) but a little too dense. Coffee wise, meh.  
Rate : 8/10 The Ambience &amp; food served was scrumptious. Besides, the service was up to standard, efficient! 
This is really good. Fluffy and moist, you can smell the aromatic fragrance of the desiccated coconut when the cake is in front of you.
Chose this Apple Cider Stacker. Definitely no alcohol in it (sad) but I like the combination of the slightly sweet apple sauce layered with the light salted cream frosting, which is surprising since I usually hate buttercream. I\'d say it\'s worth the $8.50. Bought the lemon meringue tart home, can\'t wait to sink my fork in that. Will definitely be back to try the others! #burpple
Located at the foothill of fort canning... With the newly Renovated place and aircon-ing! Ordered the fried chicken waffle and uncle A fish &amp; chips.. Both dishes are very filling and they are nice too! Got chance go and try oh! 
Eggs: perfectly runny; brioche was okay but could\'ve been more flavorful; beef bacon was good, but the portion could\'ve been bigger for the amount I paid; spinach could also have been better flavoured; rosemary potatoes were disappointing. Overall I give this a 6/10.
Pros:\n<br />- The carrot cake\n<br />- Good variety, mostly decent flavor-wise 
My favorite love is still their Red Velvet cake, so what are your fave picks at FBB?
It\'s fabulous to know that they have converted their alfresco seating with air conditioning.
Tiger prawns cooked in a secret crustacean cream. Egg Pappardelle is then added to soak up the sauce. Nice stuff.
Very reasonably priced at $12.50! And the eggs were really runny and nice! Totally love it! 
While their breakfast menu is really WHOA, I thought their cakes were just so-so. Besides having this lemon cake, we also ordered Red Velvet and their Salted Caramel. None of them really captured our hearts for a return visit. 
Poached eggs that go perfectly with hollandaise sauce~some potatoes to go along~perfect combination:)
@ the fabulous baker boy with the girls, yeah awesome stuff (what can go wrong with cake &amp; cream anw)
The experience at the Fabulous Baker Boy has always been very positive! The staff are friendly and the food is delightful! Always a good place a relaxing weekend brunch.You don\'t wanna miss the lemon tart, you\'ll hate yourself for it! Do remember make reservations though:) www.thefabulousbakerboy.com
For $11, these huge pancakes are simple and satisfying, served with a good dollop of butter and just the right amount of maple syrup. A great place for brunch or tea time, come here and relax with a good book, or a good friend to chat with. Photo by Rachel Xie.
Chilled at TFBB on a lazy warm afternoon.. the Red  Velvet cake was my favourite, soft yet not too sweet.. yet to try their main dishes but I will be back for more.. nice ambience, suitable for gatherings or spending quality time with your loved ones..
I like this place. Really, I do :) the tuna melt was dee-licious, the eggs Ben superbly done, the cakes were sublime (esp the Caribbean Lemon &amp; Salted Caramel)... Mmmm. We went twice in 3 days just to try more food &amp; cakes. I reckon we\'ll be back in a week ;) hehe. 
something is wrong with this picture, very blurry im sorry. Fab Red Velvet. a chocolate person will definitely like this! what attracted me was the color! wooo yum! #dessert #cake #dinner #fabulousbakerboy #thefabulousbakerboy
finally all is up! Spiced Beef Bacon Burger #dinner did i mentioned that it\'s served w garlic fries? cool huh? didn\'t had the chance to taste it tho :/ #thefabulousbakerboy #fabulousbakerboy #beef #bacon #burger

Rvc at TFBB. I like that it\'s a thin layer of chocolate glaze instead of the usual cream cheese frosting. Sweet without being overly sweet. #latergram #sgigfoodies #foodstamping #foodstagram #igfood #foodporn
TFBB Champion Breakfast. nicely done poached eggs, chicken sausage, mushrooms, beef bacon and sizzed potatoes! yummy! portion is quite big though, you have been warned. lol. #breakfast #fabulousbakerboy #thefabulousbakerboy
took me almost a week to post this lol. Spiced Apple Cider Pancakes. 3 nicely cooked pancakes to fill your hungry stomach, a good choice to start your day! feel free to top up your maple syrups at the condiment corner aye? #thefabulousbakerboy #fabulousbakerboy #breakfast
Towkay Ng\'s Egg Benedict #brunch for me, $11.50 w $4 sausages add-on (: sizzled rosemary potatoes, mexican chicky sausage, nicely done poached eggs and the yummy hollandaise sauce. woots. #thefabulousbakerboy #fabulousbakerboy
@amandalumpy\'s #brunch on Saturday. FAB Egg Benedict, $16.50. poached egg, smoke salmon, sizzled rosemary potatoes. yum! #thefabulousbakerboy #fabulousbakerboy
I have this crazy insatiable craving for Carrot Cakes. It\'s like every cafe I go, would order a Carrot Cake. Not chocolate, no red velvet, just Carrot Cake. Now where should I go looking for the best?
I think I could have #eggs all day without getting bored. I find pleasure in cutting yolks and seeing them ooze out!
Finally got to try out this place... :) eggs were very nicely done with roasted potatoes an smoked salmon. A bit on the heavy side and a proper full brunch. Topped off with an ice latte and salted caramel cake.. Good way to start the weekend
The hummingbird is a pleasant surprise! Looks like the usual carrot cake, but with a twist of banana &amp; pineapples instead! Simply yummy! 
Not the best.
Quite pricey to me cos I\'m not a big fan of red velvet (but everyone\'s raving about this). Anyhow, one of the better ones I had. Moist and I really liked the chocolate coating (makes me wanna try their chocolate cake!!) And it was kinda tall. While it wasn\'t bad, I should stop trying red velvets. 
Known for their gorgeous HUGE cakes, The Fabulous Baker Boy is simply fabulous. Dig into their sinfully rich, chocolate covered FAB Red Velvet cake ($9) or their classic Big Lub\'s Carrot Cake ($8.50) with a cup of coffee. Set in The Foothills, it\'s a nice place to relax with a couple of friends on a languid afternoon. We suggest that you share a few slices, but hey, sometimes it\'s alright to be selfish.
The famous red velvet cake from fabulous baker boy! Went there an hour later or else i could have saw @vanessaow haha!
Honestly I chose it for superficial reasons - coz it\'s in a pretty mint colour! Thankfully it didn\'t disappoint. The cakes are a tad rich &amp; not the fluffy kind, and I like it! I\'m sure I\'ll be back in future.
nothing special on the outside but be surprised with the small slices of apple cider in the pancake. Not sure if there is one similar out there but this is my first time trying such pancakes and I quite like it. Worth the try! #rachfoodadventure
Menu says poached eggs, but doesn\'t seem like it and eggs were overcooked. 
Needs a little bit more airiness...
Nice cake display...
May Day is for chocolate pancakes. Sort of

For those of you cake lovers, this is one of the best ref velvet cake I\'ve ever tasted. #redvelvet #cake #dessert
This was eaten on last xmas. Their red velvet cake is simply irresistible! Feel like having more of it now!
My kind of #lunch. Carrot and Red Velvet #cake are da bombz!
Collage of our garlic truffle fries, eggs benedict &amp; chocolate pancakes. Mad full now!
(JSYK, the way to my heart is painfully simple: chocolate or red velvet, or even better ‚Äî both at a time.) Then I walked up to the display, and before I knew it, I was asking for a slice of The Bette Midler. Not only does this look gorgeous with its violet coat, it tastes positively divine. The lemon provided a nice zingy contrast to the rich earl grey, and the texture is moist and dense but still pleasantly light.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#Burpple #BurppleSG #food #foodgram #foodie #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn

The former was too dense and somewhat differs from the original expectancy I had. In turn, the apple cake fared better.

Shame they were out of pancakes but not a bad second choice!
Yummy in my tummy yayyyy expensive cakes but well spent!
You gotta move in the same direction as your dreams.
BFF date night with yummy cakes! The Katy Perry Cake was an amazing grapefruit sponge cake topped with fruit loop crunch while the Celine Dion cake was a delicious Valrhona white chocolate &amp; macadamia sponge cake. Both cakes were moist and light, and surprisingly they weren\'t too sweet. Great treats to welcome the weekend!

Loved the fluffy earl grey sponge, layered with a light lemon emulsion and blueberry swiss meringue butter cream.
Maybe I should go back soon!
Maybe I should go back soon!
Probably one of the better cakes I\'ve tasted. In general, their cakes are light, fluffy, and crumbly. They were moist even though we went at the end of the day. Each cake had a distinctive flavour, we\'re not overly sweet. My favourite was their take of local staple: pandan cake (left). The taste of pandan was strong but not overpowering, and the cream cheese filling really complimented the sweetness of the cake. The coconut flakes give it an extra crunch and interesting texture. Nutty Monkey (right): banana coconut cake, filled with Swiss meringue peanut butter cream. Valrhono Ivoire Raspberry Cream (top): milk sponge, layered with raspberry buttercream. 
Added chicken and beef cabanossi at the side.
Very filling, sauce was very unique though.
Most awesome grilled cheese everrrrr @ $12 üòç
