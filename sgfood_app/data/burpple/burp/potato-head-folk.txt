Roasting seems to accentuate a corn\'s inherent sweetness. With a little squiggle of paprika mayo, and a sprinkle of crispy \"bawang goreng\" (fried shallots), spring onions and sliced chilies, these sections of sunniness were all too easy to gobble up.
As much as I love Three Buns\' burgers, the rice bowls (available all day) were too tempting to resist. So I ventured over to the Asian side with an order of \"Burning Rice\".\n<br />This was unlike any fried rice I\'d ever had before. Firstly, not that it\'s visible but there\'s a 100gm patty of U.K. beef lying in wait under that heap of melted cheddar cheese-blanketed rice. Plus enough sauces (think fiery Korean gojuchang, ketchup, dashi mayo) and crispy fried shallots to to lay the tastiest siege on the tastebuds. \n<br />My apologies for making it even harder to decide what to have when you\'re here. You can blame it on @happygreedyfoodie for posting about this dish in the very first place üòÜüòÜ
Because of ardent foodies, @angelineongsuming and @happygreedyfoodie, I not only got introduced to the big bad beautiful world of burgers by PTT\'s Group Executive Chef Adam, but also had a sneak taste of his brand new \"Watermelon Man\".\n<br />Originally created for a magazine collab for Three Buns in Jakarta, this burger (which is named after a Herbie Hancock song) is a cannonball of strong yet remarkably balanced flavours . \n<br />Looking like it could pass off as a slice of beetroot, the watermelon had survived an intensive process to get to this point. Cured in sugar syrup and a bunch of other tasty things, and compressed to achieve a tight, smooth texture, it more than held its own against all 150gms of the UK Hereford Angus beef patty. Not to mention, it had to contend with the potent quadar de carva cheese, pickled onions, ketchup and housemade thousand island dressing as well. Like a championship match between great rivals, this battle of flavours demanded a worthy venue. The space between the light cushion halves of toasted brioche was it. \n<br />From around mid May, the \"Watermelon Man\" will be on the menu at Three Buns in Singapore.
Best burger in town! 120g Hereford Angus Applewood cheddar aged beef patty, roasted portobello mushroom, garlic &amp; miso buttrr, smoked cheese, double ketchup, true aioli, in a demi brioche bun. Definitely worth every bite! This is my Burger place!  ($25) #Burppleburgermonth 
This burger is comforting &amp; delicious. 120g aged Hereford Angus beef patty, cheese, ketchup, pickles &amp; spiced mayo in a demi brioche bun. ($16)
The \"bubba\" is a minature version of the Baby Huey, Three Bun\'s signature burger, and is only available through the Happy Hour Menu from 4-8pm Tue-Fri. For $10, you get THREE mini sliders of that perfectly grilled juicy patty, cheese lettuce, pickles, spiced mayo and that special sauce in a semi brioche bun. 
These fries are so super naughty and sinful, but you know you just got to jump right into all that goodness. Firstly, you\'ll notice that the cut of fries are not regular... almost like they were potato skins but not quite. But the cut allows you to dip and scoop up all that awesomeness of fried and spring onions, beef bits and sauce in one go. Don\'t let the awesome burger go unaccompanied with a basket of these naughty fries!!
Love the vibe and ambient there. Food wise was okay.. truffle cheese fries were good ($19++). Rambo burger (lamb) ($26++) and krabby patty ($28++) are satisfying too. Come early cuz there is happy hour from 4-8pm, where we can get 3 bite size signature house cheeseburger - bubba huey for $10! Those dont like burger and fries, there is asian rice bowl, we ordered bellyfull ($18++). Overall, for the price, food quality and ambient i will give üëçüèª 3/5\n<br />‚úîÔ∏è will go during special occasion\n<br />üìçOutram park MRT
What a good combo of juicy meat, fluffy buttered brioche buns, melted cheese, pickles, onions and spicy mayo!! Sadly my Baby Heuy ($18) that day was waaaaay too salty, I had to drink 4-5 cups of water to rid the thirst
the fries are drenched in the truffle shaves and truffle cheese sauce! üòçüòçüòç
Spiced beÃÅarnaise, hot beef chilli, crisp shallots, parmesan &amp; sesame seeds
Prime beef patty, cheese, lettuce, \'Notorious T.O.M. Sauce\', pickles &amp; spiced mayo in a demi brioche bun
I like most of the beef burgers except the crab one, it has that \"xing wei\". The beef patties are juicy and tasty but too small and pricey though. Good to go if you are willing to splurge a little more for gourmet burgers
This is how the burgers look like. 4 of us shared these 4 burgers. We had the smokey, crab, original and spicy.
That tanginess from the pickles and beef patty just went so well together. Not forgetting the support from the demi brioche buns.
Fried onions, spring onions, fries/fat chips-looking-fries drenched in chilli beef sauce that\'s slightly tangy and creamy at the same time (hidden bits of beef under the fries!!).
Huey there baby. üí´
Four Floors of Awesomeness. And please guys, wherever you get your burger, order is Medium Rare is after all your Patriotic Duty. üçî\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />This is the \"Four Floors\" (üíµS$28) : Double Prime 100g Beef patties, Double Cheese, Triple Onions, lettuce, pickles, \'Notorious T.O.M. Sauce\' &amp; Miso Mayo in a demi Brioche Bun. üòã\n<br />The Burger is flavourful, the beef patties are well seasoned &amp; juicy. Overall, it\'s one of the better burgers out there, the only downside is that the size is a little small for the price one pays. (&amp; it doesn\'t come with fries?! What?!) üí∏\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPSüíÆ: Do tell your preferred temperature of your beef patty or else it will be automatically be cooked well done for you. And trust me, it\'s always better on Medium. üññüèª
Long overdue visit to this Bali-originated much talked about burger establishment. From the meticulous description of the ingredients in each burger on the menu, you know they mean business. Yes, it\'s not your most pocket-friendly burger joint but if you are insistent on quality, PHF has nailed it and have been consistently doing so. Huey Burger is their signature and rightfully so with the 120g beef patty matching in flavours with the special sauce, sweet onion and pickles. Noteworthy to mention is their brioche buns which are soft and whilst the burger is moist with full of sauce, they\'ve done it without messing up the lower layer of the bun, i.e. you can hold the burger up in your hand. I know this sounds really basic but increasingly it\'s getting harder to do so with the overly burdened creations of burgers.
Literally littered with corn! and more: bawang goreng, spring onion, chopped chili. The potato here are really starchy, yet fluffy and sliced into uneven cuts of wedges with their skin partly intact. Drizzle in the sriracha sauce and you have the perfect bowl of indulgence. What\'s more its only $7! Enough budget to order a mocktail to go with it. 
Ume flavoured Mojito packed with mint, brown sugar and lime. Truly refreshing!
Foreground: Rambo ($19++) - Lamb Patty with Feta Cheese \n<br />Background: Fun Boy Three ($25++) - Beef Patty with Portobello Mushroom
BHB: 120g aged Hereford Angus beef patty, cheese, ketchup, pickles, and spiced mayo in a demi brioche bun. NFJ: Spiced b√©arnaise, hot beef chili, bawang goreng, Parmesan, and sesame seeds.\n<br />(Delivered by @Uber_SING #UberEATS; use \'eats-uberbryandmlee\' for $10 off your first order!)
3.5 munchies: Topped with charred and pickled sweet corn, chilli, scallions and coriander, the twice-cooked hand cut fries were so crispy, so addictive ‚Äì if only there was more of the soft, piping hot potato beneath the skin, though. Loved the winning combination of BBQ sauce and cumin aioli that spiced up the potato dippers with smoky and garlicky flavours.
Nothing  outstanding but it\'s definitely one of the classic burgers to have at Potato Head folk.
It\'s one of best tasting fries I have ever had in a while. Thick potato slices topped with chilli beef sauce and cheese. 
Potato Head Folk has an impressive lot of burgers that will cater to even the pickiest of eaters. Plan your visit on a Friday night and head straight for the cosy, intimate rooftop bar to kick back with a Coco Jo Cocktail ($22) that is made with two kinds of coconut rum. Nearly every table in the four-storey building sports at least one of the legendary Baby Huey ($16), a small but plump medley of 120g aged Heteford Angus beef patty topped with cheese, ketchup, pickles and spiced mayo, sandwiched between a demi brioche bun. Want more? Go for the Smokin\' B-Boy ($25), a sloppy burger with the same beef patty, gooey smoked applewood cheese, beer and treacle bacon, BBQ ketchup and smokey mayo. Get the Naughty Fries ($12) to share. It\'s a crowd-pleasing dish of hand-cut chips fried skin-on, nestled beneath a spicy bearnaise sauce, beef chilli and parmesan.\n<br />Photo by Burppler Marilyn L
Quite possibly the best cocktail I\'ve had in Singapore so far. It has not one but two kinds of coconut rum, and it tastes like a sunny day on a tropical island. üçπ
Leave it to the crew that gave us the famous Baby Huey ($18) burger to come up with Naughty Fries ($10). Imagine a heap of hand-cut chips that are fried skin-on, nestled beneath a spicy bearnaise sauce, beef chilli and parmesan ‚Äî the perfect bar snack, we say! At the first international outpost of Bali\'s Potato Head Beach Club, expect plenty of chill out space in the four-storey building in Keong Saik, including a cosy, intimate rooftop bar that\'s great for kicking back with friends over Friday night cocktails. While the price point is not pocket-friendly, the excellent food, drinks and ambience make it well worth your spending.\n<br />Photo by Burppler Sam Chua
The most basic beef burger - but better than your regular beef burger! Must try! Outdoor seating in a kind of retro-coffeeshop(ish) dining area is nice for a lazy weekend.
The burgers were succulent and tasteful, with the chicken being fried just to my liking and beef burger with the right amount of cheese. What really made me love this place was the fries, oh god. The flavour int of the fries was so perfect and interesting, with a hint of \"singaporean\" taste mixed with western flavours. Definitely a place to check out!
Happy Saturday Night! Cheers üç∑üçπ\n<br />1) Chinatown Mojito - Mount Gay Black Barrel and Myers Dark Rum, fresh lime &amp; Apple juices, mint &amp; rosemary syrup and a splash soda.\n<br />2) Perfect Lady - me me me \n<br />3) Jiminy Cricket - Ketel One Citron Vodka, peach lemon verbena herbal elixir, Peychaud bitters, lime &amp; sparkling wine.\n<br />4) Heard It Through The Grapevine - G\'Vine Floraison Gin, lemongrass &amp; ginger syrup, lemon, citrus bitters &amp; ginger beer.\n<br />5) Calcutta Sunset - Ketel One Vodka, hibiscus infused with raspberry &amp; Madagascan vanilla syrup, peach butters, apple juice, lemon.
The burgers are good but not mind blowing enough for me to pay that much. But the fries looked like they were freshly cut and fried, which are really delicious and a must try üòç\n<br />The venue itself is really pretty and worth a trip down for a chill drink. But I doubt I\'ll return again ü§î
I have always wanted to come here for the amazing environment up at the roof top and so I managed to do so today. The weather was great and windy, but lighting didn\'t do justice for my burgers. 
Ah atlast, I managed to try this oldie hipster spot. Potato Head Folk has been around for quite awhile &amp; it should not be mixed up with the potato head in Bali. I went during weekday lunch &amp; it wasn\'t crowded at all. They had a set lunch ($28++) which includes a burger(selected few), a side, dessert &amp; drink. We got one set, another ala-carte burger &amp; their naughty fries to share &amp; it was just nice for 3 of us (girls). I highly recommend ordering the Naughty Fries to share! The fries are more like crispy fried potato wedges, with beef chili (non spicy). &amp; it was ADDICTIVE. 
#PotatoHeadFolk #ptthead #Cocktails
I think we\'re pretty up on our fries game here in Singapore, you could turn toward any restaurant/cafe and they\'d make you fries or chips that are satisfying. Naughty fries here at @burgersandheads are absolute game changers. Irregularly sliced super crispy chips (skin on), beef chilli, spiced bearnaise, crispy shallots and Parmesan. The slightly curled chips allow you to load up all that beef, sauce and whatnots in a single mouthful. I\'ve been here a couple of times but wonder why I wasn\'t introduced to this sooner!! ü§î
Featuring their Burning Man burger and that ingloriously juicy prime beef patty. \n<br />Strictly work only.
Cozy atmosphere, dim lights. A nice place with that special some one. Remember to place your reservation before heading there unless you want to squeeze with others.
I loved how they package their burgers and the cute character assigned to each of them. We had their \'The ChewBakKwa\' (refer to my previous post) and \'Baby Huey\'. Packed with goodness, \'Baby Huey\' ($18) consist of prime beef patty, cheese, lettuce, their \'Notorious T.O.M sauce\', pickles &amp; spiced mayo. Only downside was that the burgers were rather expensive as they were ala carte. On the other hand, kudos to their excellent service. Keep it up! üëè‚ò∫Ô∏è
Only available for a limited period for during cny, Potato Head Folk created this burger, \'The ChewBakKwa\' ($24), where east meets west with bak kwa from Kim Hock Seng (their neighbour), spiced pineapples, XO mayonaise, smoked cheese, picked chilli &amp; scallion all packed up in one üçî! So rich in flavour that I practically inhaled it üòÖ. Burgers are slightly pricey and ala carte as well.  Hurry! Grab it while it last! (till 28th Feb) üò£
Arguably, one of the best hamburger shops in Singapore. Sweet buns and a juicy patty.
Okay, so this is a place that\'s not an option if you\'re with friends who are on a budget. While the price point is definitely not friendly, the uber tasty burgers, sides, killer cocktails, spiked milkshakes, and lovely ambience here will more than make up for it. Do everyone a favour, and order a side (or two) of Naughty Fries ($9), hand-cut chips nestled beneath a spicy bearnaise sauce, beef chilli and parmesan. For burgers, The Baby Huey ($20) is a crowd-pleaser with a 150g beef patty slathered in \'TOM\' sauce and miso mayo. Also good is the Honky Tonk ($19), a crisp, juicy buttermilk fried chicken burger with coleslaw, lettuce, pickles and their Big Poppa ‚Äòhot sauce‚Äô. Special mention goes to their cozy, intimate rooftop bar, THE place you\'ll want to kick back with friends over cocktails on a Friday evening. Note that they don\'t take reservations for The Rooftop, so head down early if you\'re in a big group.
this is the cheese burger or sth from the special collaboration and phf\'s famous naughty fries ($9)! daaaaamn this humongous thang had me at first bite man mm still slightly too pricey for me but DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY!! the thick slices of hand cut fries were drenched in this beef chilli sauce that was so addictive oh my but this is really VERY oily too so....... you decide yourself la ok ;-) 
How are you spending your Wednesday night? Here\'s a tip: have some spanking cocktails at Studio 1939!
Tried the Four Floors (medium) after seeing many recommendations, and it didn\'t not disappoint. Juicy burger covered in a sheen of melted cheese, with fluffy buns that didn\'t get soggy. That was a fantastic sensation till the last bite. The naughty fries side was another story, although again the sauce and toppings were tasty, it was brought down with hard and almost burnt fries, due to the double frying of thinly cut potato strips. 
PHF has great stuff. Everything pictured above was a joy to savour. However I won\'t hide it from you that this meal costed a good $99! My Wagyu burger (I forgot the name thankfully I am no professional) has a mix of all the gold things, but you see.... too much of a good thing really isn\'t good for you. The flavours were clashing and heavy by the end, burger and onions and all. I would have perhaps enjoyed it more if I had not eaten so much!
Portion sizes of these 100-110g patties are just perfect for us small eaters, buns and all. \n<br />Fuss free interior decor plus lively ambience and high ceiling were super ideal for a night of catch up over burgers and cocktails. \n<br />Gonna bulk up my burger with their smoked cheese my next visit! üçîüçπ
It can be burgers, wings and fries that sounds like a western restaurant but the fried shallots on every single dish make it so Asian taste. (At least that\'s what my mum likes to use when she cook) I had the crabby patty and like many said, spongebob will definitely approved. The burger were soft and the crab party were filled with seafood taste. It doesn\'t come with a lot of mayo or what but with fried shallots (again) to up the taste of it. The naughty fries and wings were good. Eat it while it\'s hot though, a little spicy here and there but the drinks will definitely subside it. The pink guava mojito was alright. My buddy accidentally drop the leaves filled with sugar into the drink in her hibiscus mojito and she was complaining how sweet it was Hahahah! Definitely worth a try!  Though it\'s a little pricey for a burger. Burger range $20-$35  
This is four floors of awesomeness! 1) Medium well done beef patties. 2) Melted cheese. 3) Great taste chemistry combination of triple onions, lettuce &amp; pickles. 4) Abundance of its notorious sauce. Must try! 
Well, the meat did not fall off the bone, as claimed on the menu. But the wings were very flavorful and finger-licking good! 
The fries were still super crispy even though the spiced b√©arnaise sauce was drenched over it. Good but can be a little jelak though.. 
100g aged beef with their house sauce, onion relish and cheese. The beef was sooooooo good. Medium rare, juicy, tasty and tender. The Demi brioche was fluffy and slightly crisp on the exterior. Everything just went so well together.. And I finished the burger üôä well I haven\'t had a burger since US, so cut me some slack!
Naughty fries that was indeed very naughty. Crispy potato wedges topped with grounded beef, nacho cheese and pickled chilli. This was so addictive!!
The patty made of crab meat was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Paired with fresh vegetables and a fresh cut chilli for a bit of a kick, and sandwiched between two toasted buns. Would definitely go back for this again! 
It looks like a sticky mess - and eats like that too - but this is definitely the good kinda messy. Smokey sweet BBQ sauce generously slathered over crisp fried chicken wings, every bite was a burst of textures and flavours. I especially love the toppings of chilli, fried shallots and spring onions that gave these wings an Asian spin.
Tried the baby huey! Basic burger but the pickles which is their saut√© onions in red wine vinegar was overly sour. Didn\'t really enjoyed my burger as it was too sour. Naughty fries was wonderful but too little toppings. Milkshake was great! 
The level of badassery here is insane. DOUBLE the gooey melted cheese, DOUBLE the medium beef patties - and you get a mad delicious and sinful burger. I would\'ve liked the buns to be a tad softer fluffier in order to soak up all that juicy goodness.
Fresh blue swimmer crab, hand moulded into a generous patty, served in fluffy rice burger buns, along with crisp shallots, crunchy lettuce, chili, and a tasty salted egg mayonnaise!
had the Baby Hue which was super juicy and flavourful! the fries are a MUST ORDER, they are really freaking good!!
Definitely a good filling burger with great beef patty and bun, and the sauce was yummy! Though it\'s a little pricey, would come back again for quality burgersüçî
Potato Head Folk - Three Buns serves a variety of hearty gourmet burgers, good for sharing and their fries are crisp and addictive.
Unique fries sliced into an almost chips-style with spiced bearnaise and hot beef chilli. Great comfort food!
The burger here surely is worth a try!
The best crispy fries I\'ve ever had. Nice ambience.. they\'ve a live band. Burgers were not too bad
Potato Head Folk || Honky Tonk
Cravings finally satisfied. Medium rare doneness was in point, with it\'s tantalizing seasonings.. But it\'s not spicy, as ndicated on the menu.. Do order the Naughty Fries to go with the burger
Hints of hop and honeysuckle, a malty sweetness with caramel tones. Great Czech beer to begin with!
Burger place but we got fries, coffee and assorted veggies. Hur. The monster fries were really good, the cut was quite uniquely shaped like a chip and this provided a wide surface area for the chili sauce it came with. The meal flavour complemented it well too! Beets by Dre was light with the veggies, but also accented with strength of the feta cheese inside. Quite a balanced combination. All should go for the interiors! It was a pretty place, whimsical and homely with good customer service. üòä
Spotlights dim, candles lit, enchanting deco, awesome playlist &amp; my hommies who ordered a 3-course Festive Set, Crabby Patty (Hi Spongebob!) &amp; James Brown. We gt high on \"Naughty Fries\" a new drug. Tis Christmas, it\'s Nice gettin a taste of Naughty (:
Step into the whimsical world of kitsch interior decor and be enchanted by the small yet drool-worthy selection of gourmet burgers and sides. My friend and I tried the Baby Huey (think juicy beef patty. Mmm!), Honky Tonk (crispy deep fried chicken with onion relish) and Naughty Fries (hand cut potatoes topped with minced beef and deep fried shallots. A little Asian twist to your normal beef fries). The buns were fluffy and soft, and the best part was that they don\'t get soaked in the juicy patty/sauce. I personally felt that the fries had a very oily aftertaste once we were halfway through it, but it was pretty interesting and tasty I must admit! Bless my clogged arteries! üçîüçü
Shared with friend. Classic medium rare beef and buttermilk fried chicken
Latest review on Potato Head Folk Singapore is up at sethlui.com
Thinly sliced fried potato with generous amount of juicy beef chunks and spicy mayo sauce. Delish and addictive! 
#vscocam #burrple #potatoheadfolk
Third burger of the lot that I tried &amp; I must say, the buttermilk battered cod is to die for! 
What can I say? This side dish has definitely lived up to my expectations! What caught me by surprise was the fried spring onions which suggested a local twist to this dish! Was controlling myself to go for a second round! 
Top two best sellers &amp; I don\'t deny it! Succulent beef served medium rare blended nicely with their TOM sauce! As for the chicken, üëçüëç already craving for more. 
Sherbie Hancock x Bare Roots Cola x Ginger Ninja
We were surpriaed by the generous portion of their Wing-Its ($10) and they were crispy, saucy, tender and devilishly good! Definitely worth a return trip! I\'m already looking forward to our next visit! ^^
...lunch with @reroyce the other day. the Naughty Fries were to die for, but the burger was just okay.
#Love this! #yummy My weight loss plans went out the window but hmm...it\'s worth a workout. This is so addictive, I wish I could inhale the whole basket. #sfflove
Housed in the iconic Tong Ah building, this new kid on the Keong Saik block has been the talk of the town in recent months. The burgers come in beef, chicken, lamb, and vegetarian options, which makes it easy for eating in a group. The Baby Huey is a crowd-pleaser - a 150g beef patty slathered in their \'TOM\' sauce and miso mayo. Also good is the Rambo; the lamb is cooked to tender perfection, paired with eggplant pickle &amp; cucumber aioli. Please get a side of the Naughty Fries, hand-cut chips nestled beneath a spicy bearnaise sauce, beef chilli and parmesan. Crazy good!
Naughty Fries, The D.O. Double G, Honky-Tonk, Bare Roots Cola, Sherbie Hancock
Naughty fries is the bomb and so goood - dont be deceived by the chilli redness! It isnt that spicy..
The burger is so juicy and saucy! Definitely worth the price!
Fantastic burgers w sauces to drool over,  but not worth the $20 + price tag :/ . Worth a visit, loved the decor and happy day feelz. Wing its were super crispy and had a nice zesty/spicy kick to it!
Juicy bacon strips, triple cheese, onion marmalade with truffle, served with a side of runny eggs as dip. Need I say more? It was all gone in a few minutes :)
The Four Floors burger is SHIOKKKKK! Drippy, messy burger that is absolutely worth the caloric intake | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Wing-Its($8) \n<br />The wings lived up to it\'s description in the menu as crispy, fall off the bone. Drizzled in scallions and smokey bbq sauce gave it heavy flavoring, yet not overly salty or overpowering. I liked how tender the meat was I can easily down a few of these. 
Thoughts of an overpriced burger in humble wrapping were immediately dispelled when I took my first bite. The beef patty was thick yet tender, with a grilled taste on both sides. The bread was nicely light and fluffy and the sauce! Wow! Rich but not overly intense with a tinge of spice! Love it!
Fries re-defined! Interesting mix of flavors composed of minced meat, their special spicy tangy sauce, cheese and coriander. Tasted more like fried potato slices but yummy nonetheless
But the chicken was really good, deep fried but still juicy and the sauce was awesome, pity that the sauce wasn\'t enough for the burger imo
More like chips/wedges than fries, they were fried perfectly and drizzled with bernaise sauce and topped with minced meat. Yummms! | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
I don\'t know what it is with this place - their sauces are uber-tasty but the burgers always seem to be let down by texture. This buttermilk fried chicken was slopped with so much hot sauce and miso mayo that scrumptious as it was, I was just missing that crunch of crispy batter. 
you do not come to someone else\'s yard and wipe out their history. üòà. I still miss de coffeeshop selling goof kaya toast and tea
Really good burgers there. Loved their patties. I had the beef (which was very tasty), while my friend had the lamb patty and she\'s raving about it. Will definitely go back to try more things on their menu. 
Here\'s the very popular Naughty Fries ($9, handcut fries topped with hot beef chili, spiced b√©arnaise, shallots, Parmesan and sesame seeds), and twice-cooked Wing-Its ($8, crispy outside tender inside, with a lip smacking smokey BBQ sauce).
I have definitely tasted better burgers, even on this little island of ours. But honestly, we were not so disappointed as much by the food but by the service/attitude/sarcasm we received. While the first floor service was casual and nice, I can\'t say the same when we tried to move up to the other floor. It may all have been a misunderstanding or oversensitivity, but, for sure,  we will not be heading back to the place which makes us feel discomfort. And yes I will definitely not queue 2hours for a hype up place as this! \n<br />P.S. this is just my personal opinion based on a personal encounter. Every one has a different experience and opinion I guess.
The draw for me it the thick patty (could have been slightly rarer admittedly) and the tangy sauce.  The whole mustard seeds were a nice touch.  Definitely worth coming back for.
The overall flavour of this burger was absolutely lip-smacking, with a well-seasoned beef patty dripping with an addictive house-made tomato sauce and spicy mayo. But the glaring problem that compromised the whole experience was the overcooked beef - my supposedly medium patty turned out well-done, as did my friend\'s medium-rare. And really, at $20++, the best you could do was serve it in a fast food-style wrapper?! Tsk. 
Man this was gooood. Beef was cooked very well and slightly charred (which I love). The slaw really brightened the burger, as did the super tangy sauce. At $20, this gives Omakase a run for their money but I think I prefer Omakase\'s cleaner flavour. 
Topped with spiced bearnaise, beef chilli, fried shallots, Parmesan and sesame seeds. Didn\'t find any sesame seeds but I really liked the fries, which are like fried potato slices. Wish there was more beef chilli! 
These twice-cooked wings were coated in a sauce boasting Asian flavours, garnished with strips of fresh chilli, spring onion, and some sesame seeds. I liked that they were rather dry despite the sauce, but thought the meat could have been juicier. 
This is one of the burning orgasm I hardly receive when comes to burgers. One of the best burgers I\'ve tried in town. Wah this is so good lah!
Potato Head Folks has taken over Keong Saik\'s iconic Tong Ah Koptitiam, which has brought over the beautiful new concept from Bali. The sure-win, must dine three buns burger on the menu and with 3 levels of different concept combined. You may visit the whimsical second floor for their signature cocktails and overview of Keong Saik at the third floor for an al fresco feel if weather permits. 
Simple love the special sauce used in my Baby Huey burger. The Honkey-Tonk burger is one of the better chicken burger I had.
Fanciful names for their burger and sides. We had honky tonk (fried chicken burger), Rambo (lamb patty burger) and four floors (double beef patty burger). Their patties were tender and juicy paired with grilled butter buns. We got our hands drizzled with cheese and sauce, it was finger licking good! 
Wedges with chili beef. It\'s like nachos but tacos replaced with fries, how awesome is that! 
A velvety blend of dark and milk chocolate, the Rich Chocolate Pothead gets a sinful yum yum from me.
This knockout mess is on almost every table here: hand-cut potatoes doused in spiced b√©arnaise and topped with chilli beef, shallots, Parmesan and sesame seeds - how do you say no to that? üòç
$20 for a burger the same size as MCD, with nothing too fancy except for the sauce. Ridiculously overpriced but it\'s delicious.
Easily the best chilli beef fries I\'ve ever had. And for $9, I\'ll take two of these over any of their burgers.
Tried the baby Huey a couple of months(?) back and it was so good!!! Probably a little pricey but so worth the price 
This was Honky Tonk - crispy Buttermilk fried chicken sandwiched between two artisan buns, stuffed with coleslaw, lettuce, and lastly drenched with homemade Big Poppa Hot Sauce and den miso mayo. \n<br />More photos on the blog  http://alainlicious.blogspot.sg/2014/06/potato-head-folk-newest-hipster-spot-at.html
One of the better burgers I tried so far, the beef was really juicy.
This beautiful new concept from Bali has taken over Keong Saik\'s iconic Tong Ah Kopitiam, and is thankfully serving great food in an inviting space. Tuck into a Three Buns burger on the whimsical second floor, and move upstairs to the third floor bar for a drink, or the rooftop garden if the weather permits. 
ü•ì\n<br />.\n<br />Still thinking about savoury ice creams now even after I had a couple of really good ones the past year. It‚Äôs not something you see everyday, so once you happen to chance upon it, be it Bacon, Foie Gras or even Truffle ice cream get a little adventurous and try them. ü§§\n<br />I know now Apiary @apiary.sg are still offering their ‚ÄúBlue Milk‚Äù which consists of blue pea flowers infused in milk for the blue hue and a pinch of pink Himalayan Salt.

There\'s is something about this fries that makes me unable to stop. 
We let @Veronica decide our lunch destination and look what we got ourselves into; a glorious sloppy burger with thick 150g angus beef and portobello mushroom. While it\'s pricey, this burger is absolutely delicious with the fragrant butter buns and smoked cheese sandwiching the beef patty.  
100g of prime beef frankfurter with roasted portobello mushroom, garlic &amp; miso butter, ketchup, garlic aioli, melted truffle cheese and truffle oil in a toasted butter bun. I have been a big fan of the burgers at @burgersandheads but this was the first time I tried their hotdog. I was pleasantly surprised! Although I still preferred the burgers, this hotdog was nonetheless delicious enough to order again in future.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_threebuns #threebunssg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Since Chef Adam @peeneysmalls introduced this yummy burger to @veronicaphua, @blueskiescottonclouds and me, we‚Äôve been waiting for him to put it on the menu.\n<br />*\n<br />Finally got to try it again. Although we still preferred the Fun Boy Three, this came quite close. It may sound strange but the caramelised watermelon was a very interesting complement to the Hereford Angus beef patty. I did feel that the slice of watermelon could be slightly thinner. Nevertheless still very yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_threebuns #threebunssg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

While we love the burgers here (especially the Fun Boy Three), my husband and daughter\'s favourite dish is actually the Burning Rice, which I would describe as a burger in fried rice (rather than buns) with gochujang sauce üòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />Naturally the next burger we wanted to try was the Burning Man. 120g of aged Hereford Angus beef patty with applewood smoked cheddar, roasted jalapeno relish, hot ketchup and dashi mayo in a wholemeal bun.\n<br />*\n<br />Although I still prefer the Burning Rice, the Burning Man was still a burger worth having if you like it spicy.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_threebuns #three buns #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

I like how there is a wide variety of beef burgers to choose from. For those who do not fancy eating beef, there is the Rambo, which is a lamb burger. I tried it for the first time and it was very good. More in my next post.\n<br />*\n<br />For an extra $2, you can get a small portion of the House Fries. The fries served here were the chunky sort. They were crispy on the outside and soft inside. Yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_threebuns #threebuns #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
We immediately knew we had a winner when we first set our eyes on it. Fried rice with 100g aged UK beef patty, gochujang (Korean red chilli paste), dashi (Japanese stock) mayo, ketchup and scallions. Notice how it was completely covered with cheddar cheese and topped with bawang goreng üòçüòç. Such a brilliant creation by Chef Adam @peeneysmalls - a burger in fried rice instead of a bun üòã. My daughter even thought it tasted better than a burger!!!\n<br />*\n<br />Adding gochujang gave the fried rice a spicy Korean twist and lots of oomph! Completely up my alley. Loved it!\n<br />*\n<br />The picture on the right is a cross section of the dish. Notice the generous helping of beef at the bottom. This dish completely blew us away.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_threebuns #threebuns #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Superior 120g lamb patty with feta, aubergine pickle and cumin aioli in a wholemeal bun. It was a pretty damn good lamb burger. The lamb was not overpowering and the combination with aubergine and cumin worked well. However, I think I still prefer my beef burgers.\n<br />*\n<br />My favourite burgers at Three Buns are still üòçüòç:\n<br />- Fun Boy Three - their version of a Mushroom Swiss\n<br />- Smokin\' B-Boy - their version of a Bacon Cheeseburger\n<br />*\n<br />Each of these burgers contained 120g of Hereford Angus aged beef patty in a demi brioche bun.\n<br />*\n<br />Most of the key ingredients are sourced directly from the UK. I like how every ingredient played its very own part in creating the mouthwatering taste of the whole burger. Simply delicious!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_threebuns #threebuns #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Literally ‚ù§Ô∏èat first bite! Chef Adam was kind enough to let us have a preview of the Watermelon Man. Here the grass fed Hereford Angus patty is paired with caramelised watermelon, melted quadar de carva (most divine goat\'s cheese), ketchup, pickled onions, three islands mayo in a lightly toasted brioche bun. This new creation is launched at Three Buns in Jakarta and will be available here in Singapore in mid May.

120g aged Hereford Angus beef patty, topped with smoked applewood cheese and Dingley Dell beer and treacle bacon, nicely sandwiched by a lovely demi brioche bun. This is one heck of a bacon beef burger #smokingbboyburger #ultimatebaconburger #threebuns #potatohead #foodies #keongsaik #whati8today #sgig #sg #burpple

Having had the Fun Boy Three, I wanted to come back and check out their other burgers. Thanks to @happygreedyfoodie, we had the pleasure of meeting Chef Adam. Now I know why the burgers here are so outstanding! Chef Adam is so passionate about creating the perfect burger! From the right type of beef, to the size of the patty, how it\'s grilled, the concept behind each burger, how he named them. Chef, indeed not all burgers are created equal. Yours sure stands out way above the rest! #passion #burgers #threebuns #lunch #whati8today #foodies #potatohead #keongsaik #sgig #sg #burpple

For some reason, I can taste milk/vanilla in their mix.. the chilli beef and condiments do add a different dimension into the taste. Somewhat a little fusion.. for some pple, the fried shallots/spring onions might be a little Asian but I think it\'s something refreshing and worthwhile to develop in western food!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#potatoheadfolk#potatohead#fries#naughtyfries#burger#foodie#eatsg#delicious#clarkquay#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Beef Chilli cheese fries 8.5/10
The zesty hot chilli and the tangy bernaise adds a different dimension to the crispy fries.

Very juicy burger and tasty sauce. My friends found the portion to be a little small. I still prefer the burgers at Bergs, equally (if not more) delicious, and better value for money.

They offer a wide variety of burgers ranging from $19-$45. The Baby Huey beef patty burger [$20] was simple and good.

I don\'t know why they call this Rambo it\'s not hard nor tough. It\'s tender lamb patty. I\'ve not eaten a lamb patty but if this is the example then I\'m all for it than beef. 
Love the fries! Fun dining place 
Tasted good because the 150g beef patty was juicy and quarter pounded but found a sauce inside made it too salty! #foodreview
