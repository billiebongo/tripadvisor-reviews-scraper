Dinner part 2! #burpple
So much for being the \'world\'s most expensive city\' 😄
What a decadent lunch. 😵
Since I am up and early on National Day, I decided to check out this place and see how much it has changed. When in Singapore, it is almost guaranteed that the food will be good if you see a line of people queuing for it. Hence, when in doubt, just follow the line.\n<br />.\n<br />Since it\'s the nation\'s birthday, what better way than to have for breakfast a good plate of local wanton noodles. As I seldom patronize the food centre these days, I definitely got to go with the Wanton Char Siew Soya Noodles ($4), which is like an upgraded version of the normal ones. The lean strips of honey glazed pork (char siew) was the healthier kind that has very little fats in between while I like my egg noodles coated with chilli sambal and lots of green chilli. The soya sauce chicken was nothing to shout about but overall it was a comforting meal. This is home truly.\n<br />.\n<br />Bai Li Wanton Noodles\n<br />Address: 538, Bedok North Street 3 Food Centre, Unit 01-92, Singapore 460538 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood  #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock #bedoknorth #hawkercentre #wanton #noodles

A tangy taste comes in when mixed with the chilli and lime!
The oysters are huge!
The sides came in a generous portion and the best part was that there was a garlic bread as well!

Yummy!!
So good that I can\'t stop eating! 😋😋
Yes I agreed. And I really miss the Seng Kee mee sua 😫 havnt had it for years😖
Sucker for all dry #noodles!
Not the best maybe but good enough. What made this stand out were the tiny bits of deep fried pork lard generously sprinkled into the kway teow. $4 serving could have had a bit more \'harm\' but I\'d say this was a decent fix for CKT craving. #eatoutsg #8dayseat #whati8today #instafood_sg #Sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #sgfood #sg #singapore #setheats #jiaklocal #hungrygowhere #burpple #singaporeinsiders

Kway Chap again - this had a little bit of stench which I don\'t appreciate. Other than that it was pretty tasty!
