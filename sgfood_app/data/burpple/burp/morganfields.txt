I\'m not sure where the \"crayfish\" meat was but there was a couple of prawns. Loved the entertainer app that helped me get 2 mains for the price of 1. Do note the free kids meal doesn\'t apply when you are using the entertainer app.
The rib bone is as long as my radius/ulna. It was nicely done too, so tender! Will come back for more.
Thick and chewy, I prefer pork with marble of fats, so it will be not so tough to Chew on. -M
Time to have a feast!!!🎊 Can\'t wait to tuck into the mouth-watering sticky bones 😁🍖 #tgif
Hot chunks of Pork rib pulled off the bone. Meat lovers kinda burger. Thick sticks of fries.
2nd time having their spare ribs! Garlic BBQ Spare Ribs ($27.90) is best eaten on an empty stomach. Super filling for a single person but I manage to finish it while enjoying every single bite. Love the sweet, spicy and tangy sauce! 😋 Served with a side of a generous portion of fries and colesaw!
Morganfield\'s has a nice ambience with both indoor and outdoor seatings. Plenty of seats available, never overcrowded. 👍🏻we had their Smokehouse Bacon Cheeseburger ($22.90). Medium well beef patty grilled and glazed with Hicktory BBQ sauce for that sweet and sour flavour along with crispy bacon, cheddar cheese and caramelised onions! It comes with a side of fries as well! 😋
The Ocean Platter that too much for 4 adults and 4 young kids. Ok but that\'s abit too unbelievable but there were also 3 soups, 2 pilaf rice and 2 baked potatoes. But even then the kids shared some of the food from the platter with the 4 adults. Sticky ribs were so tender and easily pulled apart. We walked away thinking the platter could have been shared among 3 to 4 NS men. Service was impressive. The team was very attentive :)
First time trying Morganfield. Not a meat eater but the rib really taste good. The food are all very yummy. Thumb up for the good services, nice ambience and tasty food. Will go again. 
All their ribs look the same - my favourite are the Hickory Smoked, &amp; Garlic ribs. The other 2 didn\'t do it for me (in terms of flavour), although the texture is great no matter what flavour you order.
.\n<br />{Candied Beer Bacon} - Glazed with hazelnut brown nectar beer these warm sticks of bacon were as visually arresting as they were delicious. // Hop on over to fundamentally-flawed.blogspot.sg to find out more about my Christmas [GIVEAWAY] where I\'ll be giving away an entire Morgan\'s Christmas feast worth $149 to one of my lucky readers.
The latter was especially addictive!😋👍🏻 .\n<br />.\n<br />Do you know that if you spend at least $300 at Morganfield\'s on your birthday (actual day, before or after the actual day) you are entitle to @morganfieldssingapore\'s rib pass too? Grab a few friends or your family down to celebrate and I\'m sure it won\'t be a problem to hit the $300!😁👌🏻.\n<br />.\n<br />Ps: the rib pass allows you to enjoy a half stab sticky bone every month for a year!☺️
No matter how many cafés boast \'amazing\' ribs, I\'ve never had one comparable to that of Morganfield\'s. The ribs are tender, moist, juicy, yet retaining that slight bite which makes it all the more satisfying. Just look at the amazing char on the ribs! For S$40, you get one hugeass whole slab of succulent BBQ ribs! Honestly the cheapest one I\'ve seen; most places offer half the portion or less at that price. So this is hands down my favourite.
Morganfield\'s weekend ribs buffet definitely comes at a steal at $40 nett (of course check the fine print for details). Here on a lovely Saturday afternoon, this was the perfect meal to quench a morning session of tennis. The buffet comes with side dishes like garden veggies, mashed potato, fries, and chili concarne, providing a variety of flavors to tickle your tastebuds. 
A sharing platter suitable for 4-5! not someone who fancy ribs but it is really good. definitely worth the money and going back again 😊
a mix of ribs, ham and other festive meats. a feast for a group
I haven tasted a dish as that mouth watering for quite some time. candied bacon grilled till crisp. what a merry Xmas this will turn out to be.
Morganfield is celebrating Xmas and one of their takeaway dishes is this huge bourbon glazed leg of ham. big right!!! time to start ordering 😂😂
BEST MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER. \'nuff said | ★★★★★
The portion is really big for 2, second try. Like the meat and it is well marinated and grilled. Givit a try and you may come for second time!
For meatatarians!!! Ham, turkey drumsticks, sausages, broccoli, potatoes, pumpkin, n fab ribs
Wow this cheese nachos is amazing! So much cheese! And I don\'t like chilli, yet the chilli sauce was great cos it wasn\'t spicy yet tasted great
Sausage platter, thyme sticky bones, cranberry sticky bones, ham, turkey drumsticks, roast pumpkin, potatoes, corn bread &amp; broccoli. Each platter is $149.90. EPIC. 2 platters, 10 people. Great for groups!
With 2 turkey legs, 6 sausages, one Christmas cranberry sticky bones, one thyme sticky bones, honey baked ham slices with sides ( roast pumpkin, roast potatoes, corn bread &amp; broccoli) $149.90. I swear this is fit for 6 ppl not 4!
Meat meat meat!!!!!!  $149 for 4 persons. But I feel this is for 6 persons!!!
Incredible Christmas platter of sausages, sticky bones, ham, turkey &amp; carbs. The sticky bones are really good! 
Oh warm thick fries with super cheesy cheese on top! Love it! 
Seriously the best chocolatey things I\'ve had in a long time!!!! Both were super rich and warm ahhhh 😍😍😍😍 we were so full that we couldn\'t finish it but I wish I can have the remaining now! The brownie was a birthday gift for Ali by the restaurant staff! So thoughtful!!! And the mudpie came with the platter 
Super huge platter of 3 rib flavours!! And side dishes with the esp nice corn muffins! 😍 Expensive platter though it was yummy! $116. The best thing was the good service! They even packed the food for us to bring home without us knowing/ asking!
This is a meal for 3! Ribs are soft and tender. Good place for groups!
Awesome food and awesome service! It was a really huge portion that I shared with my father and brother!
Try the pork patty. Also, yes, it comes with the knife stuck in it.
Just met two amazing people today and I think it\'s my present for Good Friday, perhaps? So blessed so have them sharing my interest and most importantly, food. @qiuuing @alainlicious Great to meet you guys today!
Pork ribeye! Loving the grill marks on the cut. The highlight was the awesome mustard sauce on the side. Happy I got to try @alainlicious main course.
Halved chicken marinated with spicy tequila, lime parika, char grilled and served with french fries and dessert bread! 😋 She has the best main!!! @qiuuing
@qiuuing order of poultry farm! 🐔 Tequila spiked chicken! Presentation didn\'t appeal to us, at first impression the chicken look dry! But it\'s actually uber yummy! 🐓 The meat is so tender! Liked! @alpha_nique
Nice to MEAT you! Porky 🐷 or Beefy? 🐮 Same same but different!
My Grilled pork rib-eye chop! 🐷 Marinated pork shoulder chop served with red skin mashed potatoes, buttered vegetables and homemade creamy mustard grain sauce! Not a pretty shot but who cares I\'m hungry!!! 😋
Let the feeding begins!!! @qiuuing @alpha_nique 😋 @chaverry and @lirongs couldn\'t join us today! You can see but you cannot eat! 😂
Fries baked with cheese, topped with pork bacon bits and served with chili concarne! 🍟 @qiuuing @alpha_nique
While sissy @qiuuing and I were waiting for @alpha_nique to arrive, we ordered an appetizer to kickstart our dinner! This is Chili Cheese Fries! 😋
Main course tonight. Can\'t really remember the name of this dish. Chicken seasoned with paprika and chilli, served with fries. A little sweet corn bread at the side with served as mini dessert.
Chilli cheese fries as starter! With @alainlicious @alpha_nique
The cake and the ice cream is huge. It\'s yummy!!
Chunky mushroom. Nice and value for money. Big serving for $7.90.
Portion looks small but actually it\'s quite filling for 2 person.
Average. Beef patty is a glorified version of something you\'ll find at Wendy\'s. Portion was huge. If it\'s raining heavily and you\'re eager to satisfy your hunger and western craving, this might somehow make it. $22.90
After a 45 minutes wait with countless apologies, this Hickory BBQ ribs and Tequila spiked chicken was finally served. The ribs were easy to eat, the meat comes clean off the bone!
Meatballs wrapped in bacon to start off dinner! Crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside 😬
One of the best chocolate lava cake I\'ve eaten so far! Located in Star Vista
Very generous portion. I ordered a full serving and shared with my friend but we were unable to finish the whole portion so we had to give out to other friends!

Pork Troo($15.90) - Candied bacon has a weird texture. But bratwurst isn\'t half bad, &amp; the popcorn pork is pretty damn good! The batter isn\'t crazy thick, &amp; the pork is super juicy. The sauce that comes with this platter is also delicious. Yum!
