Does The Clueless Goat have anything special or superbly delicious to offer? Not to me. My coffee was decent but doesn\'t get me as excited as The Lokal or The Plain, avocado blt was pretty average and not entirely complex to create. If you don\'t live near Novena or happen to be in the area then it might not be worth the travelling down...
Found an all day bfast cafe near United Square.
Who wouldn\'t want this for brunch on a lazy off day? Chorizo, Bacon, Fluffy Eggs and Truffles Tater Tots plus a cup of perfect coffee. Service was very good as well 👍 
nowhere near de best but I\'d take anything to bring Friday closer. someone\'s even trying to steal it from me as we speak.
Fuel for 3.5h of classes in a bit. This Rancher\'s Eggs is nowhere near the Aussie ones that I\'ve had. Avocado where art thou? Well.. If you eat for sustenance, I guess this may do. Though I can make a better one myself at a fraction of this cost.
After a long weekend, let\'s start the day with a good breakfast.
Buttermilk waffles served with bacon and a sunny side up - not a bad rendition but could have been more exciting. The coffee from common man coffee roasters was good, as expected. 
4 munchies: Loved how the eggs were nicely poached and the hollandaise sauce was light with the right amount of acidity. I was pretty bummed that they ran out of sauteed cremini which I\'d like to balance the saltiness from the smoked salmon. The smooth and strong-bodied coffee did not disappoint as well.
A more substantial brunch at $14.90. Sausage was grilled nicely. Very ordinary plain toasted bread. Went well with the crisp bacon and sausage. Scrambled eggs were a miss, had a distinct diary taste and were a tad over did. 
Looks really impressive with the layer of melted cheese! However, even with the pleasant mild Swiss cheese and alright ciabatta, the thin slices of beef really distracted everything. Beef slices were down right rubbery, and had little taste. Imagine chomping down on the ciabatta and trying to dislodge the beef slices. Quite an unsatisfactory meal. 
liked how de eggs fit perfectly well on the toast with the mix of greens. \n<br />not that clueless after all?
Brightening up the Novena neighbourhood is The Clueless Goat, a new cafe which serves coffee, waffles and brunch options. The beans used are from Common Man Coffee Roasters, so you know your coffee needs will be met. Choose from a variety of brunch options such as their Ranchers\' Eggs -- poached eggs with smashed avocado, salsa and shaved parmesan -- and their British Breakfast Platter. Do not leave without trying their very unique waffles, which taste like a cross between buttery pancakes and fluffy waffles, perfect for when you can\'t decide between the two ;)
Coffee is good – balanced, aromatic and smooth, sourced from Common Man Coffee Roasters, using the 22 Martin Blend which is a medium roast.
Waffles here are a bit on the unconventional side; some might disagree because the batter doesn\'t cover the waffle grill completely or because it\'s pretty flat, looking somewhat like your average neighbourhood waffle but I guess it\'s just the cafe\'s take on the waffle to make it unique to themselves. It\'s a mixed breed in between buttery pancakes and the chewy neighbourhood waffle; a combination that I actually felt was rather decent and special compared to the myriad of waffles available in the market now. Grilled Chorizo is big, juicy and full of smoky flavours while the sunny side-up\'s runny yolk and crisp white was a winner.
I guess nothing ever could go wrong if you put Paprika Crumbed Chicken, Lettuce, Tomato, Parmesan and a tangy Lime Mayo atop a crusty Ciabatta, which all of them are a classic combination put together. If anything, the crumbed chicken was crisp to bite being tender for breast meat was used, and is basically a heavier sandwich for those who find that grilled sandwiches just feel too dainty for their liking
Like what?
the food was worth the price although I felt  waffles in a cafe shouldn\'t be served in this manner. not as clueless as it sounds ? \n<br />how\'s everyone Sunday going?
Multi-grain Toast served with salsa, smashed avocado and poached eggs. The multigrain adds the crunch, and the salsa adds a nice tinge of zest to the buttery avocado. Poached eggs was runny despite having used 30mins for photography; pretty impressive. Garden salad was pretty fresh, but could do with more dressing.
Must say that despite the toast being quite ordinary and that I didn\'t like how it came with tater tots (sautéed potatoes any time than processed potatoes), The Clueless Goat seems to have an edge in their grill, having able to achieve a smoky flavour with the sausages and the chewy bacon. A choice of scrambled, poached and sunny side-up is available, and the scrambled despite not as runny as some others is delectably creamy in the inside with an eggy exterior.
Coffee here requires more work; using Common Man Coffee Roaster blends it seems missing of the usual acidic body that some may dislike in other cuppa using the same blend, though you still get the chocolatey finish at the end.
crispy buttermilk waffles topped with berries with caramel sauce and toasted marshmallow ice cream. Waffle is very good but portion too little 😝😝
Coffee lacks body, requires some fine-tuning. Otherwise, The Clueless Goat is off to a promising start. Hurry down before it gets crowded!
We hear their waffles with maple syrup taste a lot like McDonald\'s hotcakes, which ought to jolt nostalgic, fond memories of yourself pulling Mummy towards the counter for the Happy Meal Toy back in the day. Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh #Burpple
The waffles were essentially McDonald\'s hotcakes who accidentally walked into a waffle iron. They were buttery, salty and slightly crispy on the outside. The twirly pig meat was an appealing mix of chewy and crispy, while the egg yolk tasted exactly like soft-boiled egg. Very satisfying. 4.1/5

Certainly they are not  clueless about their dishes 😝 Multigrain toast with mashed avocado, 2 runny poached egg, and a refreshing taste of salsa and salad -- all for less than $10.
Also ordered a iced long black. Nothing too fantastic

Whilst the toast had the dour stoniness of a condominium showcase pamphlet distributor, the other breakfast elements showcased a Mavis Tutorial Centre-esque earnest industriousness. 3.6/5
Strong coffee in a cute cup

Its the end of the workweek. Getting my coffee fix. ☕️
The coffee and waffle are standouts but the tatter tots are disappointingly lacking in the truffle flavour. =( #pigout #sgcafes #cafehopping #cheatmeal #alldaybreakfast #burpple

It’s unreasonable, of course. Nothing begins with so much excitement and hope and pleasure as love, except maybe writing a story. And nothing fails as often, except writing stories. And like a story, love must be troubled to be interesting\' - John Dufresne。
It\'s just not easy. Truth。
Roast beef sandwich [$9.50], toast with jam [$4], 5 oz white [$4.50] and mocha [$5.50].

on another note, it\'s midweek for me, off to some adventure on Friday . anyone going to bangkok too? 😜
It is monday again. Looking forward to all the exciting events happening this week.
Clueless no more for some affordable fare at the clueless goat with some clued in coffee :)\n<br />#thecluelessgoat #breakfast #sgig #sgfood #food #foodgasm #FoodPorn #foodstagram #igsg #igstagram #burpple
A pretty good start for March.
It\'s quite hard to get Affogato wrong so it\'s really a bit unbelievable how this one was. That double shot of espresso was actually decent; the ice-cream however was an icy ball of vanilla even after some intense photo-taking being a wee bit melted. 
Tasty and price friendly, considering the location and really friendly service for a cafe that\'s only a week or so old :)\n<br />#ranchersegg #poachedegg #eggporn #multigrain #bread #breakfast #sgfood #food #FoodPorn #igsg #igstagram #sgig #thecluessgoat #burpple
