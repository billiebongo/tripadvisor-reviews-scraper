Dried Bak Kut Teh
Left: Dry bak kut teh - still refer Old Street Bak Kut Teh (129 Upper Paya Lebar Road) which is the closest I can find to my favourite dry bak kut teh place in Malaysia. \n<br />Right: The soup is sweet with slight herbal&amp; pepper taste. Remind us of the one we had tasted in Klang, a lighter version.  Meat could be tender though. \n<br />#dinner #eatout #foodporn #yummy #fatdieme #makanhunt #food #instafood #instafoodies #foodie #foodgasm #fotd #foodgram #foodinc #sgfood #happytummy #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple #FoodReviewsAsia
