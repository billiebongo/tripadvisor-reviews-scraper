BLC\'s indo curry crab (nope, no affiliation to Indomie) is best described as the love child of laksa and a thick Nyonya curry. Fresh, succulent crab swims in an ocean of lusciously lovely curry gravy that is best savored with either fried mantou or good ol\' white rice. The gravy itself is the main attraction. Ever had a laksa that was so tasty but yet so utterly unfulfilling due to the gravy lacking that all important gao-ness? Well, this right here is the solution, and it is superbly shiok.
Another of my favourites from @biglazychop - the humble Hotplate Hakka Beancurd (S$13++)!\n<br />.\n<br />At #zichar restaurants, I must order ÈìÅÊùøË±ÜËÖê without fail and I dare say that #BigLazyChop\'s rendition is one of the best I\'ve ever had.\n<br />.\n<br />The tofu is homemade and it has a smooth silky interior barely held together by the fried skin. The effervescent thick meaty sauce together with the fried egg make a wonderfully savoury combination. Just give me this and a bowl of white rice (or two) and I\'ll be utterly satisfied.\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @biglazychop, @foodnewspr and @burpple for the scrumptious meal! üòã
A restaurant that was named after me, @biglazychop. Haha I kid! It must be some sort of freaky coincidence.
It\'s a toss up between the indo curry crab and these bad boys for the title of \'Best Dish to Come Out of Big Lazy Chop\'s Kitchen\'.
We thoroughly enjoyed this Indo Curry Crab with sauce that reminds us of Laksa. Finger-licking goodness! Soak up the sauce with steamed or pan-fried Mantou ($0.60++ /pc.)\n<br />#BigLazyChop #DaLanPai *
.\n<br />The Indo Curry Live Crabs here, created by the chef, is very different from our usual chilli crab. It has this addictive curry that opens up your palate with a kick at the end. I actually drank the curry. Very savoury.\n<br />.\n<br />Opened in Dec last year, this air-conditioned tzechar place located at 1A Short Street is just opposite Rochor Beancurd. Conducive yet the prices are reasonable relative to the tzechar eateries out there, it\'s ideal for gatherings and celebrations. Expect some dishes that were injected with elements of surprise by the chef. Really local and authentic.\n<br />.\n<br />Psst. Pls call up to reserve, their star crabs get snapped up really quickly!
We had their Wok-Fried XL Crabs featured Live Sri Lankan Import Crab with each weighing between 800 to 850grams which can be done in 5 different styles - Black Pepper, Indo Curry, Salted Egg, Chilli and Bee Hoon. Their black pepper sauce blends various sauces with crushed peppercorns and is wok-fried with crabs (almost the same size with your face) until it becomes one with it as a thick rich reduction. Addicting spiciness with a little sweetness, this is a dish that is worth getting your hands dirty for.
Plump and saucy, full of crab meat, this was one of my favourites for the night.\n<br />#BigLazyChop

One of my favorite which I missed. Venison with ginger, onions and snap peas. Tender slices engulfed in black pepper sauce. It is alittle spicy and alittle wokheish. I am a bit peckish and I am in the need for meat!! ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />This restaurant is tucked away from the madding crowd. A cze char place with the head chef dressed in chef\'s white. Cos we were seated near the kitchen window, we could hear the clink clank sound of the big metal spatula. Serious wok action going on. Food was prepared upon order.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Food was not \"wow\" but decent and prices are reasonable. However, dinner menu was limited. Their signature is the claypot indo curry crayfish noodles. Promo now on when u order the noodles, snap a pic, tag @biglazychop on fb/ig, you get a 20% off total bill.
üîº\n<br />Not overpowered by the coconut cream, it was spicy enough, gravy was not too thick or heavy but still maintain that legit curry aftertones. 1st slurp, the heat hits you but as more slurps are taken, you get used to the spiciness till it came to a point that left your palate with a sweetness on the tongue.\n<br />üîº\n<br />The beehoon not overcooked and it soaks up the gravy with no soggyness effect. One and a half pieces of crayfish (reasonable sized) covers up the top of the claypot. Alot of beehoon though. To me it is not da best but it is worth trying to dissipate one\'s curiosity of \"does it taste as good as it looks\".\n<br />üîº\n<br />This dish cannot be found in the main menu so you have to ask the service staff if it is available. Comes in 3 sizes : S, M &amp; L. The portion here is small ($13) and is good for one pax. I kinda like this place cos it is spacious with aircon and alfresco. Good news for those who drive..the carpark is just next to the restaurant.

We drove past and saw the Chinese name, and we knew that this restaurant is a must-go! Despite their tongue in cheek name, the restaurant serves HK Dai Pai Dong style tze char. We had the milk butter ribs which was very well marinated with tender meat that comes off the bone easily. The menu features an interesting mish mash tze char creations like the crabmeat money bag, fried chestnut bar etc. There\'s no doubt it\'s a place I will highly recommend for friends and family dinners, just a matter of how do I tell the older folks the name of the restaurant without sounding crude.
Would be perfect with some bee Hoon or vermicelli :)))\n<br />#biglazychop #crab #srilankacrab #indocurrycrab #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Instead of using typical cereal, prawn crackers are crushed to resemble Rice Krispies, giving this a super crispy and fragrant taste. #Yum. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #sgfood #foodsg #sgfood #cerealprawns #zichar #onthetable #whati8today #burpple #instafoodie #foodstagram #delicious
