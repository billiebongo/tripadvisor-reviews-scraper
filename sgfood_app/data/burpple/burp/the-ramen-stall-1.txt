I ordered their signature Ramen dish - The Volcano Ramen and it comes with minced chicken, a slice or two of chicken cha shu, corn nibblets, bamboo shoots, seaweed, braised egg and of course, the ‘volcano’ chili paste. When you order, they will ask you to choose the spiciness level of the Volcano Ramen with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest and most spiciest and OBVIOUSLY, I had to chose Level 3. 
Really good food. Authentic ramen raste and the shop ambience is great! Customer service is superb too. Constantly making sure waters are filled and are friendly too!! 
You get to choose the how spicy you want. Level 1\'s good for me! We also tried the chicken bone, heart and skin. Squid leg. They\'re alright, but the chili that comes with it, the best!! #burpple #hungrygowhere #halalsg #sgfood
Opens till 6am for supper goers and friends who knock off late. Ramen, Kaisen Don and Sashimi in the wee hours of the morning are now a reality.
Two things to note: The Ramen Stall opens till 6am in the morning for supper-goers, and it has been certified Halal. \n<br />Yes, 6AM!
Wooooo. \n<br />The Ramen Stall at North Bridge Road has now an expanded menu, and didn\'t know it is Halal too. \n<br />Another place for late night supper with friends. Opens till 5am!
The dry ramen is served at room temperature with a choice of spicy or non-spicy. Tasted pretty decent with the mix of sauce in it but we couldn\'t really taste the slightest spicy kick at all. The only redeeming factor of the dish is the texture of the ramen. Still prefer their volcano ramen than this.
Good news for the Muslims!
Very meh, just all that. The chicken pieces were huge, the batter coat is even thicker. The egg did not delicious coat the chicken, and those onions just laid around lonely. Thank goodness, I was extremely hungry, if not I couldn\'t finish half of the Donburi. 
Late night hunger kicking in at 11pm? What about at 2am? No worries! If you\'re craving for Japanese dishes especially; ramen, sushi, tempura prawns, sashimi, you name it! The Ramen Stall @ North Bridge Road will cater to your Japanese tastebuds in no time. Popular with supper junkies who are known to feast from 10pm onwards, The Ramen Stall operates til 6am and provides an impressive menu spread - you\'ll be spoilt for choice! I had spicy cold ramen noodles (which was upsetting as it didn\'t come with a piping hot option and I prefer to eat my noodles hot!!) along with sides of prawn, sushi and chicken. There was even miso soup! The hot Favourite and best-selling ramen on the menu was the Volcano Ramen; definitely not for the faint hearted and heat intolerant! A must-try there if you\'re a spicy-loving food enthusiast!!! 
Choose from three fiery levels for this most Popular Volcano Ramen!! I\'ve chosen Level 2 but for chilli lovers like me, I don\'t think it\'s spicy and fiery enough for my tastebuds. I\'m definitely going back soon for Level 3!! 💪🏼

Halal Japanese food! 
// @TheRamenStall\'s {Volcano Ramen} allows challengers to choose from heat levels 1- 3 depending on their level of \'garang-ness\' ; so, those a tad insane should take a dive in the fiery depths of the level 3. With chicken broth as base, it appears the heat comes out a whole lot more than the usual tonkotsu variants\n<br />●\n<br />#eatoutsg #burpple #theramenstall #instafood_sg #eyecandySorted #sgfoodporn #hungrygowhere #igsg #singaporeinsiders #sipandgulp
👍🏼 Halal
This is the stuff that you crave for in the middle of the night. A cross between hard ramen and the hawker style wanton Mee... the cold ramen packs quite a punch, high on the carb Richter scale too, to sooth all the alcoholic munchies.\n<br />•\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #igsg #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders #instatamen #sgfoodporn
🛳 || Salmon, Hokki Shell, Sweet Shrimp, Tuna, Mekajiki 😍, Tako and Tukimi Komochi sashimi luxury platter at Halal Certified Ramen place @TheRamenStall at 787 North Bridge Road\n<br />•\n<br />Come on Tuesday nights for the freshest loot! The Mekajiki was on point, sans the usual creaminess you hope to taste and the Tako rubbery as heck. Other than that, there were no gripes 👍 and I must admit that I loved the Tukimi Komochi (essentially sotong stuffed with cod row) - first time\'s a charmer!\n<br />•\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #theramenstall #burpple #hungrygowhere #igsg #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders #8dayseat #sgfoodporn #sashimi #tukimikomochi #mekajiki #sgsashimi
A great departure from the usual Tonkotsu broths that we usually indulge in. ~ Chili helps to add to the length of the soup, creating an impact in its otherwise translucent nature. But don\'t be fooled, the level 1 is quite a kicker; so spice-lovers, be warned\n<br />•\n<br />#whati8today #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #igsg #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders #theramenstall #8dayseat
