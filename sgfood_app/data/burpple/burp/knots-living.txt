Went there seeking to have a relaxing lazy afternoon over a cup of coffee, cakes &amp; book. The matcha lava cake was flowy &amp; sweet go well with the unsweeten cappacinno. Was relaxing sitting facing the full size window overlooking the busy streets of Paya Lebar. Unfortuately i forgot my earphones &amp; it\'s a weekend crowds tend to be rowdy &amp; loud. If you are seeking a quiet cosy cafe avoid weekends or stuck your ear with some ear plugs or phones. I love the interior deco of floral. Will be back again on a weekday pm.
I was here this morning for brunch with my colleagues. Quite a rare find in a largely industrial area. 
Nice ambience. Cosy. Perfect for doing work as there are not many people. Spaghetti Marinara was okay. Have yet to try the other food. Will most likely come back.
Had doubts about the food after reading fellow burpplers\' reviews. But gotta give this lava cake many credits! Banana walnut muffin was not bad too~
Welcome to the Instagrammer/hipster\'s version of IKEA; think gorgeous wood furniture showroom meets cafe in industrial MacPherson. Rainbow cake was decent and you get a coffee for an extra $2!
BILL: $8.90nett for cake and coffee combo 
Last Saturday, we went to Knots which is so pretty as it\'s filled with flowers, plants and natural light. Plus they have furniture for sale too! Not much selection so we went for Banana Gusto ($9.90), basic waffle topped with a mint and chocolate ice cream plus coffee for perk me up. There\'s definitely room for improvement though.
Although the food and coffee fell abit short, the ambience and companion made up for it. All the furniture and plants you see at this cafe are on sale at a discount. Many would refer this to the \'Karmakamet\' of Singapore. Surreal and out-of-Singapore feel.\n<br />.\n<br />#knotsliving #waffle
You need to know why you would come here - it\'s for the good vibes of chilling here with a friend or two, but not for its food, at least not yet until it sorts out its kitchen.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The food isn\'t great, but ain\'t that bad either. There\'s only one overwhelmed chef so they can\'t serve most items on the menu (they agree to serve me eggs benedict but my two friends could only order waffles). The waffles and poached eggs were also of varying consistency, some poached eggs were undercooked, some overcooked, while some waffles were softer than others, though generally too soft for crispy waffles lovers.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I still enjoyed dining here because of its conducive  environment and gorgeous interior. I think foodies may not like the food here that much, but Instagrammers would be happy to find many photo opportunities.
I was amazed as I step through its doors.. this gorgeous cafe filled with greenery, furnished with wood furniture and lined with cement screed walls. I certainly didn\'t expect to find a cafe in this industrial building, where all its neighbors are pure furniture stores (like Scanteak).\n<br />üî∏\n<br />You\'ll see price tags on the furniture used here, because it\'s also a furniture shop suited for Muji or rustic themes. Such an apt place to have brunch with my interior designer, and especially conducive because the cafe was quiet and spacious. Ample parking lots were also available at the doorstep of this cafe.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />For food, they have a selection of brunch items such as egg benedict, waffles, ice cream, coffee, pizzas and sandwiches (review of food to follow later). They even sell flowers too!
I leave others to reveal gems that\'s in my \"territory\", since I\'m only home at late night haha.\n<br />:\n<br />Knots is owned by the online florist Xpressflower.com, so it\'s no wonder that plants and flowers have a striking presence here. Small potted plants and terrariums are the first things you\'ll see after pushing the glass door open. The wooden furniture and lights, supplied by Triboa Bay Living, are simplistic and stylish, adding a notch of class. Do head up to the loft via the spiral staircase to check out their furniture offerings, they\'re all on retail - warning: your money-spending fingers may tingle...\n<br />:\n<br />Since I\'m only here for a tea break, I can\'t really comment much on the food (decent raisin swirl and Gryphon Tea), but their recommendations seem to be the waffles (out when I was there) and pizza for groups. It\'s not exactly convenient to travel down from outside MacPherson or Tai Seng, but if you\'re looking for an inspirational cafe to work or lounge in, Knots should definitely be one to check out and added to your wishlist.\n<br />:\n<br />#Burpple
-\n<br />That being said this cafe/showroom, like how @larvitar aptly puts it, is an Instagrammers wet dream. It\'s how you would envision your house robbery if you don\'t mind the clutter. Lots of wood, open spaces and pretty furniture. The food is secondary. Although the ice cream is pretty good. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burrple
Part florist, part furniture shop, Knots Living has most recently introduced a cafe to its space. It may be a little out of the city in Paya Lebar, but we reckon Instagram junkies will be trooping down in no time to capture its gorgeous interiors ‚Äî think grey walls, rustic wood furniture and beautiful floral accents, all served up with a dash of hipster panache. Soak in the good vibes as you sip on a Caramel Macchiato ($5.20), tuck into all-day breakfast classics like Eggs Benedict ($12.90), or treat yourself to the Banana Gusto ($9.90), a waffle topped with a scoop each of chocolate and chocolate mint ice cream supplied by Ice Cream Chefs, sliced bananas and marshmallows. For maximum visual impact, add $1 to make it a charcoal waffle! It\'s a lovely space to spend a weekend afternoon chilling out with a friend, preferably one who loves Instagramming as much as you do. Pro-tip: They currently have a pizza deal ongoing. Pay $25.80 for a 12-inch pizza, two drinks and two scoops of ice cream. It\'s great value!\n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh
(It helps that Knots is primarily a furniture/floral service space.) I rarely find sufficient reason to fawn over dining spaces, but I am positively infatuated with Knots\' Japanesey combination of woody, flora-infused, grey-walled and hip-modern cafe vibes. It\'s an Instagrammer\'s wet dream.\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />Pictured is the Banana Gusto (waffle with chocolate and chocolate mint ice cream). Ice creams are from Ice Cream Chefs, with (supplied) cakes, sandwiches, pizzas and eventually pastas forming the menu selection.
However, @knots_cafe_and_living buttermilk waffles impressed me together w a generous amount of ingredients! Breakkie is served on a wooden plate, compliments the entire cafe theme. I will be back to try there sweets. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />#reikovsfood #burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders #nomsterofficial #knotscafeandliving #waffles #foodie #potd #picoftheday #instadaily #love #throwbackphoto
I ordered their Parma Ham Benedict to try which cost me $16.90\n<br />Tasty. Filing too. Ambience is nice too. There is a big t.v. on the wall, a lot of flowers and furniture. Realised that they are under Xpressflower too as their staffs are wearing Xpressflower logo. Definitely will come back again for more.

What might have been a decent matcha waffle is ruined by subpar ice cream, and a copious amount of chocolate sauce drenched all over it. There\'s certainly room for improvement here\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #hungrygowhere #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #8dayseats #sgig #igsg #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #tslmakan #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #burpple #burpplesg #exsgcafes #setheats #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodsteps #sgigfood #sgmakandiary #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #exploresingapore #singaporeinsider

The lavishness of the three types of cheese inundating the soft and chewy macaroni is an absolute treat and you will not be left feeling overwhelmed by its richness after you finish the dish to its last bit.
Delicious
$9.90 banana gusto (able to choose any ice cream flavour) featured here: matcha zuki &amp; choc herseys #burpple
Probably the cutest low key place you can find in Singapore ‚ù§Ô∏è The interior was so nice! Food was okay, but I only had their eggs ben, which was a surprise since they served it with waffle instead of bread. Management was nice, met the owner and explained the whole concept and inspiration of the place. Definitely a must! You might like the furniture as well, they\'re for sale at a discounted price!‚ò∫Ô∏è
This time a newly opened cafe that also sells handmade furniture from the Philippines.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#ig #igsg #sgcafes #sgeats #burpple #knotsliving #waffles #chocolatewaffle #newcafe #strawberry #icecream #inthehoods #knotslivingcoffee #desserts #weekendfun #newplaces
