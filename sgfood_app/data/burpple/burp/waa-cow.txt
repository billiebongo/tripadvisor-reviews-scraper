Where else can you find an Aburi Chirashi bowl and a Wagyu beef bowl -  both which are slightly cheaper (just because you are in school)!? Although the Chirashi is a bit lukewarm, the taste of its sauce with the Aburi is just great! The Wagyu Bowl was also not bad, with the beef being tender and tasty as well. The fried soy chicken wings, if dipped and soaked in the soy sauce is really good! This is definitely worth a try! #NUS #burpple
The pinkish wagyu beef slices were really chewy yet tender💞 however the dish didn\'t have the wow factor because the onsen egg didn\'t make the dish taste richer and eggier:( there wasn\'t much seasoning for the rice, just torched which ended up making the rice drier and harder. The serving was so small that I had to buy another bowl to share with my friend to fill my sad stomach:(
😋 \n<br />Be there early because they have limited bowls! \n<br />Anyhoo, I\'ve been bedridden for 4 days now with a high fever, tonsillitis and flu 🤒😷 I NEED TO RECOVER SOON, I MISS YUMMY FOOD AND DESSERTS 😫
In NUS! $16.15 for NUS students but still ex\n<br />Slightly small for my big appetite but tastes and looks as great as it is!
😛
For a 10$ price tag, the bowl was very small and disappointing. The rice was a bit too oily for my liking. The onsen egg however was quite good.
Taking over the defunct Late Plate in NUS Shaw Foundation Alumni House, Waa Cow! may just be reason enough to go to school. The Japanese-inspired menu features both rice bowls and small bites — perfect for lunch or a snack during those long breaks between tutorials. With thin strips of pink wagyu beef on a bed of lightly charred rice, the Wagyu Don ($17.90) is delicious and value for money; or tame the munchies with the the crispy and flavourful Soy Glazed Wings ($8.90). There are plans to roll out a dinner menu, but till then, the cafe opens only from 11:30am to 3pm. Go early as the bowls run out quickly!\n<br />Avg price: $20 per person
.\n<br />哇靠! Why nowadays students have all the nice food in school!\n<br />哇靠! Why NUS so far!\n<br />哇靠! Why must climb hill some more!\n<br />.\n<br />哇靠! So much seared beef topped on short grain rice drizzled with aged soy sauce. But I preferred my beef to be medium raw instead.\n<br />.\n<br />哇靠! NUS students and alumni have 10% off, so envy.
I was in for a treat at this little eatery tucked at the side of Shaw Foundation Alumni House in NUS. Featured here is their Wagyu Don ($17.90) that has loads of succulent beef, sous vide egg &amp; topped with juicy ikura &amp; salted veg that complements every mouthful of rice. For it\'s price tag, it\'s definitely worth it. \n<br />Good thing if you\'re from NUS as you\'d get a 10% off! Too bad I was a tad late &amp; couldn\'t get my hands on the Chirashi Don 😭 
Situated in a secluded building which I didn\'t even know existed, was a new Japanese restaurant. I\'m very pleased with their small but focused menu, unlike some other places which try to sell 1001 things from American Breakfast to Korean Bingsu to milkshakes. My expectation was rather low after all the disappointment in school\'s restaurants/cafes and the price tag surely made me worried. Surprisingly they turned out to be a pleaser for me and my lunch partner. He was happy with his chirashi bowls that was filled with generous amount of sashimi -- salmon, swordfish, tuna, and octopus -- all aburi-ed lightly. My wagyu don was certainly not the best but still well-executed. Thinly sliced wagyu with an onsen egg in the middle and a lovely huge scoop of shallot jam (stands out from the rest!). The interesting part was how they blowtorch the slices of wagyu as well, after being placed aesthetically on top of the rice, which created a very slight burnt layer on the rice. My only concern was on the wetness of the rice, either due to the sauce (on the rice) or beef juices (or maybe a mixture of both + runny egg yolk). I am a big fan of \"wet rice\" but some people may not, so just take note or you can inform them about it before hand (they are very nice and friendly btw ☺️). For a splurge meal in between lectures on a packed day, this will be ideal for most students. (Well, it\'s only 5 minutes away from my room 🙈)
The seafood was fresh and this rice bowl was good. Just that I feel like it\'s a bit expensive but other than that it\'s good!
From Waa Cow!, a new eatery serving Japanese rice bowls at NUS Shaw Foundation Alumni Clubhouse. Headed down after seeing this particular don via Burpple, though they seemed to have reduced the portion quite a bit it seems. That being said, the bowl was satisfying; from the slightly charred, sticky Japanese short grain rice with a little savoury flavour from the beef sauce to the brilliantly pan-seared Wagyu beef which was pretty tender. Like how they included the shallot jam which were undeniably sweet yet garlicky, flavouring up the whole bowl. That being said though, I would rather Grilllo\'s version than this, but this would definitely settle the cravings of the students of NUS without traveling all the way out. Would definitely be back to try the Aburi Bara Chirashi Bowl some day! PS: NUS alumni, students and staff gets a 10% discount.
The Short Review
Absolutely love this bowl from @waacowsg - that generous portions of sashimi and well season bowls!
18.9 for wagyu mentai don with onsen egg. Not bad!
Had such an amazing lunch at @waacowsg today 😋 for the meat-lovers, the Truffle Aburi Wagyu Beef Bowl ($22.90) is simply to-die-for!! The blend of truffle and #wagyu beef bone sauce produced an intoxicatingly harmonious fragrance, and the 24hr #sousvide wagyu chunks were scrumptiously tender. Their non-need options are stellar as well - the Mentaiko Salmon ($18.90) came with a generous slab of sashimi grade #salmon fillet, torched to medium-rare perfection and smeared with the umami pollock fish roe sauce. Loved the surprise bits of ponzu-marinated garlic which were simply addictive. Definitely coming back for more!! #burpple #burpproved
No need to queue as long as Man Man. 😂
Mentaiko Wagyu Beef. 😍 brought the wifey too coz it\'s her kind of food.
Finished every grain of rice in that bowl. That delicious!
The perfect sous de vide egg, slightly charred rice and well-marinated beef were really on point, but the minus point for me was the overly fatty beef that left a pretty gelat feeling after that. Will be back to try the chirashi once I save enough to patch the damage on my wallet 😅 Now more conveniently located at Utown\'s SRC and with 10% discount, NUS students are in for a treat :) #waacow #burpple #burpplesg #wagyubeefdon #ricebowls #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #igsg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #onthetable #whati8today #sgfood #nuseats
