BEST TOBLERONE ALCOHOLIC MILKSHAKE! Cosy little cafe in the midst of condos but gotta say that their speciality would be their alcoholic milkshake. Would definitely go back for more. 
The pulled pork burger is amazing. So is the chocolate and hazelnut milkshake. The poached eggs were cooked very nicely too. All reasonably priced. 
Lovely french toast, crispy in the right areas even though I personally prefer thicker ones. I\'m not a fan of the jam though, but with the ice cream, it\'s heavenly! 
I have been searching for lava cake all over Singapore, is my new fav. I wasn\'t disappointed when I cut thru the cake, chocolate lava was flowing out. Was rich and thick, good but I thought something was missing. 
Awesome cozy place with really cool interior. Though the overall feel is a little on the dark side, their mains definitely have a hold on me! Milkshakes are crazy good and for $9 you get a huge glass of it! The ribeye steak is one of the best I\'ve ever had but a little pricey at $30. Their pork cheeks were also reasonable good at $26. If you\'re feeling good and you\'re willing to spend, then this is definitely a good place to hang out with your friends, or just your date. Guaranteed to blow you away :) 
😍 creamy smashed avocado balanced with a tarty feta cheese crumble, sprinkled with home-made duqqa (hazelnut and spice mix) on warm toasted brioche, completed with a lemon wedge for extra tang. I was choosing between savory and sweet for high tea and the barista/manager I think recommended this baby. 2 thumbs up and seconds to come!
Having very recently celebrated their 3rd birthday, Jimmy Monkey Cafe, regarded by many as one of the pioneers of Third Wave Coffee in Singapore, is still pulling great shots on their Slayer machine. My latte was nothing short of wonderful.
A well executed and tasty Eggs Ben with Smoked Salmon. However, Jimmy Monkey\'s has an open concept layout with the kitchen sharing the same space as the cafe, so you can\'t avoid smelling of food when you leave. 
This place serves up Aussie brunch choices that are pretty good value for money. More often than not, I get my eggs done sunny side up when I order a big breakfast here, or anywhere else for that matter. I find they go really well with the other stuff on the plate. Also by simply breaking those yolks, I create an instant rich dip for my toast. And there\'s no denying that the runny yolks of fried eggs are tastier than poached. 
Does this looks savory enough to you? Indeed it was a jaw dropping experience 😱😱 last weekend over @ Jimmy Monkey Cafe &amp; Bar. \n<br />Introducing you this gem \'Brioche French Toast\' with toppings of banana, sticky caramel + crushed walnut. \n<br />This amount of serving suitable for two to share and definitely a dish you should try when you\'re here! 😍\n
A hipster cafe located at it\'s residential area at the ground level. Simply create the laid back atmosphere in One North. Sometimes it\'s good to take bring yourself away from the city side and enjoy a cuppa of coffee at a cozy corner with good mains and desserts. Jimmy Monkey is one of the coffee roasters that has been in Singapore for coming about five years now. They roast different types of blends and it\'s available upon request for personal/business use. I have patronized Jimmy Monkey for coming about 4 years now, and nothing changes except the menu but the coffee just keeps on getting better and better. If you understand the coffee theory you will know what I mean 😉
Jimmy Monkey is an Australian-style cafe that offers a range of delectable comforting meals and artisanal coffee. Caffeine junkies - you would\'ve heard about the legendary Slayer Espresso Machine before, right? Some say it makes coffee taste that much better. If you\'re skeptical, why not grab a Flat White or Piccolo Latte? They\'ll be pumping out tasty brews from their custom built Slayer Machine all day long!
Citrus Mint. Very minty but not citrusy, but happy to have more liquid on this hot day.
in fact my flat white was done so good, i had to have a second helping! is much stronger than my usual favs yet remain smooth and buttery. trivia: they roast their own beans and the machine you see here is actually a custom made espresso machine! how\'s that!
Slowly getting to love this version of the French toasts. An extra serving of maple syrup is a must request though, imo.
good ambience, really dark and cozy! best place to chill with your friends over good dessert and some beers 
Located in the depths of One North, you can expect a modern hipster interior with wooden tables for communal dining, high ceilings, and a condusive vibe. Give their French toast with golden syrup &amp; fresh berries a try if you\'re looking for a bite to go along with your coffee.
Journey to the West and back at Jimmy Monkey for Sunday brunch with love.
2 eggs any style (poached eggs) with streaky bacon, grilled Roma tomatoes, rocket, multigrain sourdough toast, bonne maman apricot and butter. 
JM bread pudding with butterscotch liqueur caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream
Complex and unusual with a distinctive pungent cocoa-ish nut finish. 
Jimmy Monkey\'s French Toast, uniquely different from the other version, as the brioche was drizzled with orange ginger honey glaze and topped with poached plums and creme fraiche. A savoury sweet type of French toast and incredibly exotic in a way.

Trust the Aussies to whip up some seriously lip-smacking brunch fare! It doesn\'t have to be complicated to be goooood.
One of the better cafe-restaurants we\'ve been to. Food was really yummy and coffee was very fragrant. Only downside was their poor ventilation so be prepared to come out reeking of food/oil. Nonetheless, we\'ll be back to try other dishes :) 
Kinda.. Quirky? LOVED the signboard with chalk drawing of stormtrooper with \"May the froth be with you.\" Pity the rain came and washed it off before I could take a photo. Hidden gem. Place\'s a little dim thus the lack of photo heh. 
$15! idk if it\'s just me but got bored after awhile although it was not bad.
New #cafe pl near my neighborhood.. The cake is really good and my iced mocha is good and strong, but I think it\'s overpriced... 
Fix at Jimmy Monkey. Delicious coffee, slightly too expensive food menu, delightful experience.
Good morning! Starting my Saturday with a hearty breakfast with my favourite couple ♡
Hanging out with @mattwong_ over coffee .  Its always good to have you over at NCC. Have an awesome time at Legacy, JPCC &amp; Hillsong Conference bro !

--the Hulk $16--\n<br />Fantastic mashed 🥑 toast with cheese within.\n<br />Scrambled eggs at additional charge.
Delicious food + soothing ambience
When the liquid yolk oozed out of the poached egg onto the mash and the sourdough toast, 😍😍😍 •\n<br />#burpple @burpple #hungrygowhere @hungrygowhere #jimmymonkeycafe @jimmymonkeycafe #avocado #thehulk
I also asked them to replace the soft-boiled egg with scrambled egg to perfect my breakfast! No more privilege of waking up late for weekday brunch this semester but it\'s alright; I just can\'t wait for summer to arrive (:\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #bread #food #coffee #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat

The omelette with cheese and pork totally ace\'d this one! Very filling and simply enjoyable!
With added sausage, avocado &amp; spinach! This is a super hearty breakfast! Really like it a lot and can really taste the quality of the ingredients!
Strong coffee taste with just a hint of chocolate to it. Will appeal to those who prefer towards the coffee type. \n<br />Photo &amp; comment credit: ofTokyoNParis.
