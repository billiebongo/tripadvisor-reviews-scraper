There\'s always rooms for improvements, a non-starchy base risotto. Definitely a better choice if you like your risotto to have a watery base. 
Enjoyed the Mac and cheese!  Truffle fries weren\'t outstanding though
I\'ve been here a couple of times already and the food never fails to disappoint me (ok...maybe that salmon burger I had wasn\'t that good) but besides that, everything I had here has been super delicious especially their truffle fries. Today we tried the omega 3 salad and I enjoyed it a lot. The Caesar is pretty good too. Portion is huge though if you aren\'t too hungry. Oh, and I learnt that they don\'t serve coffee in the evenings. Nevertheless, it was a good visit once again :)
My first experience that wasn\'t a good one. Couldn\'t taste any mentaiko at all. In fact I got this drifty coconutty taste:/ is that how mentaiko cream taste like?
Eggs royale is a combination of poached eggs on smoked salmon, laid on English muffins, topped with a generous serving of yummy hollandaise sauce. The sides (hash brown and bacon especially) were yummy as well and made the presentation of the dish look better. However, I was disappointed with the English muffin as it was thin and too hard to cut up. I would have preferred the muffin to be thicker and of a fluffier, softer texture, instead of it being almost rock hard. 
Decided to go PARK at holland village for brunch after Zumba . All their meal are quite big potion , truffle mac and cheese looks very little but it\'s pretty enough for one pax . It\'s a nice and relaxing place to have a rest in weekend .
Been meaning to try this place since forever and found myself there on a Saturday afternoon. The mushroom truffle risotto was amazing!! Full of flavour, truffle-y and cheesy all at once and mushrooms in every mouthful. Sadly the truffle fries we shared were average. But when in good company and when washed down with wine/ beer/ cider, who can complain.
My favourite TV dinner makes a very good start to a wonderful day as well... Mac N cheese. This portion is really too small for me though! Felt like I was a tourist in @parkathollandv because the other customers were all speaking in Korean, french, etc. \n<br />Discovered this with @sugar_singapore ! #wewantsugar #parksg
The pudding was smooth and silky, and barely holds its shape in your spoon before melting orgasmically in your mouth. Topped with a delicious Nutella sauce, you will be scraping the bottom of the bottle for more, and wondering why they don\'t serve it in bigger bottles (preferably a 1.5 litre bottle). It\'s quite light, so you can probably finish it alone, although sharing with another is fine as well. Just not too many though, you may end up fighting each other for the last spoonful. 
Truffle fries done right. The truffle aroma was really strong, and lingers in your mouth as you eat the fries. A generous amount of cheese is given, which is always welcome. The fries are served piping hot, and you can tell they were freshly prepared, or at least fried before serving. Towards the end we were each grabbing three to four fries per bite because one is simply not enough. One of the better truffle fries around! 
I really liked that this was served in chip form as opposed to spam fries. This resulted in a spam chip that is super crispy and like a potato chip, with all the familiar awesome saltiness of spam. As opposed to spam fries which tend to simply be just rectangular pieces of spam, this was a more interesting and delicious attempt at serving spam in a cafe. Good for an afternoon snack to share with friends!
This was only so-so. While the presentation was pretty impressive, the dish itself left much to be desired. It was quite a normal plate of pancakes. The ricotta cheese, fruit, and pancakes went well together, but nothing special really. Quite a meh dish if you ask me. 
Truffle Mac\'n Cheese üç¥ Tastes so good with truffle and its filling. We had spam fries too, but kinda disappointing because its too thin, overly crispy and can only taste the saltiness. Mentaiko pasta was great whcih my friend had. The matcha milk was good with cute latte art. No coffee at night only certain drinks and craft beer and some alcoholic drinks at night, which is something to note and breakfast sets ends at 5pm. The prices are reasonable and comforting for a rainy day.
The dip would be awesome if it wasn\'t too watery, and there were not much beef. 
Don\'t be deceived by the small serving for I could not even finish it!!! They are quite generous with the cream and cheese, making it delicious at the first bite but I was quite sick of the flavor as I neared the finishing. The price is considered to be one of the cheapest ($13.90) compared to the other dishes! 
Calling all Truffle freaks! They have the best Truffle Mac and Cheese.
A hearty Breakfast Platter which proved too much for one. In fact, it took 3 girls to finish this huge portion of eggs, sausage, mushrooms, potatoes and buttered toast. But I guess if you are one big guy, this platter may be just the right amount. 
The duck confit iz slightly dry but its good! üòãüòã. Truffle fries too but overall not bad experience because rather good service! üòâ
THUMBS UP! Park is located at Holland village easy to locate. A combination of cafe and pub by night. Craft beer and good food. Ordered bake eggs with chorizo sausage potato and bacon fried to perfection the way I like it. My partner ate mentaiko cream pasta he\'s comments \" damn good must come back again \" coming from a picky man. Also ordered side of spiced fries. Totally worth another visit. Overall 8/10 
PARK made my fiber intake much easier, especially with their honey or mango herb dressing.
It was nice to begin with, then out of nowhere, a sudden surge of jelak-ness kicked in.
Awesome brunch at PARK yesterday. The honey oat buns were slightly chewy with nice textures. The thick salmon patty was moist and there were hints of wasabi that goes well with the mayonaise.
What would you have on a lazy weekend? For me, it would be ice cold craft beers and light finger food
Amazing salad bowl to begin with as starters, perfect for sharing as well!
Beautiful massacre.. Head down to PARK @ Holland for some of the best brunch in the west
Very creamy but doesn\'t really have the mentaiko taste. Miss the one at Five &amp; Dime! Had a lovely afternoon with the guyz @jichenwang @dahbeeeed and @zeemonsterrr. Can\'t wait for our next meet up already! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Feel great to be able to have freshly brewed coffee not too far from home over a holiday break.
Couldn\'t keep my fingers from returning to the tub for more! The crispy juicy chicken burger is as its namesake, and the slightly sweet and dry honey oat bun was a good compliment to the chicken. Salmon burger was ok but not as memorable. Presentation of the tea set was pretty special as well - order one to see!
After wanting to try PARK\'s food for so long, I was able to try it! was so amazed by the pretty latte art and omg the matcha latte turned out to be so good!!! The salad was not bad as well and the truffle fries are üòçüòç tried the pasta and I thought it was okay. The mac and cheese looks good but after eating too much of it its just bleh cos it\'s too cheesy. The staff was really nice and great service! good place to have a coffee and chat with friends üòäüòä
Truffle Fries ($11) This was really quite addictive! Addition of the parmesan cheese was a thumbs up for me! 
This was $16.50, poached eggs with parma ham on toast and bacon, potatoes, tomatoes and mixed greens. Quite disappointing that everything else tasted yummier than the eggs themselves! The eggs I had were overcooked and had a sourish aftertaste ): 
We hear that the sauce used in the Mentaiko Cream Pasta is really yummy! Other pastas include pesto chicken linguine and prawn aglio olio. Photo by Burppler Valerie Han #Burpple
First time ordering their sandwich and I think it\'s pretty good.
üòä You\'ve been missed! // On a side note, awesome food üëç
Really good latte with a very different kind of latte art üòÜ
The smoked duck focaccia was really good! Other dishes I would recommend are the mentaiko pasta and aglio olio (one of the best in SG).
Yum I love it, but not exactly worth the price for its portion!
After a handful of visits to Park Cafe, their coffee here is excellent and definitely have met the basic requirements. It\'s definitely a cafe to visit for their coffee and brunch!
Full of flavours, worth trying! The cafe is just right outside once you step out of the mrt station. Great atmosphere, good food!
Burgers &amp; sides, mac &amp; cheese, truffle fries. All were amazingly prepared and a delight on the palate! 
It was a disappointment this time at Park, the burger wasn\'t right at all. The chicken thigh was served cold and ingredients tasted sour which spoilt the taste of the whole burger. There\'s always rooms for improvement for this!
Lucky the drumlets came with some greens üçóüçü I think I look very unglam when I\'m eating, but who cares haha
I absolutely love this place and would definitely come back because 1. A great amount of variation to choose from (which is also bad cause I couldn\'t make up my mind!!) 2. The ambience is just right 3. Service was pretty good even though they only had 2 servers!
Yes, I\'m a regular here, haha! Ordered the Crispy Juicy Chicken Honey Oat Burger today. Just like the name of the dish, the chicken thigh is deep fried till crispy on the exterior and juicy inside. Yummy!
Awesome burger!!!! Really interesting crispy patty, and the chicken thigh inside was deliciously succulent. With just the right amount of sweet chilli sauce to lend a sweet/spicy flavour, I really enjoyed it! | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
What I like about chicken? It\'s crispy skin. The chicken was nicely fried, paired with their honey oat buns.
Pull Pork Burger @ Park Cafe on the weekends, it\'s the way how indulgence should be üòÑ it\'s almost weekends again, get ready!! 
Felt the earl grey pudding was a mini treat for the sweet tooth, while the truffles fries were good and flavourful! Who can ever resist truffle fries? ;)
Served with rosti, mushroom, mixed greens, bacons and grilled tomato. This is incredible, given at their generous sizing of food and the hidden recipe that makes the crowd goes round!
Craving for some western eats &amp; cupcakes from Plain Vanilla üç∞
So sinful, but who cares? Look at that cheeseeeeee!!!
Usual latte - \"a rich bold and flavourful, smooth body with new bright flavors\" 
An open concept bar &amp; cafe, given an overview of their modern chic rustic looking interiors and an glass in show kitchen with chefs working on your food! 
Food is not too bad. Coffee needs to be worked on though. But yep it was a nice surprise and I wouldn\'t mind going back to try the other food if I am in the area. 
Before that it\'s chill time haa üòÅ
A gastropub where you can enjoy your meals quietly. Love their looks-little-but-actually-a-lot Mac &amp; Cheese! A little ex to be $8.90,but worth the try
Fab sausage but the rosti tasted like fried onions rather than potatoes 
It tasted like fishball noodles (but in a good way)! The spam chips and truffles fries were great too. This place is DEFINITELY worth a return trip.
Warm, crunchy nachos with creamy cheese and salsa. A simple and delightful night snack outdoor experience.
If only it tasted as good as it\'s look.
Breakfast menu at PARK, available till 5pm
Poached eggs sitting on toast, snow pea, smoked salmon, mixed greens, rosti potato, saut√©ed mushrooms with homemade hollandaise.

Second time and just as good.
Set in a surprising area of Holland Village, right in front of the MRT exit, this eco-friendly cafe/bar is a nice respite amidst nature. Serving all-day breakfast, this cafe transforms into a bar at night with an extensive variety of drinks.
Refreshing to see caf√©s getting their eggs right.. #burpple #foodporn
Spam chips - unhealthy goodness. Hehe...
$8.50 for this bucket of PARK\'s version of truffle fries. There\'s a lovely aroma of truffle oil when you step into the cafe but the taste of truffle in the fries weren\'t as strong as I hoped it would be. Presentation and service were great though! 
This was cooked to perfection although I admit I was initially put off by it\'s greenish outward appearance :/
One of the most satisfying pancakes - Park in Holland Village recommends Pancakes with Caramelised Bananas as one of their best pancakes. It is indeed a treat for people who have sweet tooth, and the caramelised bananas brings out the pancakes so well. 
11/09/2013, Pancakes with caramelized apples. The caramelized apples belong to sweets heaven ‚ô°. So good. Not a fan of the service here though. #pancakes #dessertfordinner #sweettooth
...pancakes with smoked salmon for dinner? why the hell not.
Too much sour cream and vegetables on the top which was a bit overwhelming. Smoked salmon and pancakes were decent but not brilliant.
Sage, anchovy and tiger prawn risotto at PARK, Singapore. Not nearly one with flowers and trees, but close enough. Read the full post on http://smittenglutton.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/park-holland-village/!
breakfast with lina!
breakfast with lina!
Lunch with mum and sis! Parmesan truffle fries, signature Park wings, Caesar salad with poached egg and the favorite chicken pesto pasta.
Coffee is too hot for a flat white and is a little burnt but the overall taste still came together quite nicely. 
Lemon meringue cake. Honestly by then I was so full I couldn\'t enjoy it. Such a huge slice.
Wonderful sage and anchovy risotto with tiger prawns. Not many people like anchovy but the combination of it with sage lent a bitter, slightly musty taste to the risotto. Yummy!
Didn\'t do this justice. In love with their chicken pesto pasta. Also another dish which was highly recommended by the staff.
Aglio olio with tiger prawns. Might be a bit too spicy for some but just nice for me!
Smoked duck tacos. Food is totally underpriced! Absolutely good standards with great ambience!
Caesar salad with onsen egg. A crowd pleaser according to the waitress. They usually serve it in the day and made it an exception for us. The sauce was rather diluted and the Caesar sauce didn\'t come through. But the waiter was very observant and asked if we wanted to change a new salad because it didn\'t look like the usual one. Very good service!
Surprised to see it\'s plating and nachos done up so nicely. Nachos was crispy, but felt the duck could be abit softer.
The crowd volume seems just nice with this outdoor sitting. Good atmosphere and a great experience to chill.

To think that I just had truffle gnocchi yesterday üòÇ Park\'s food is always awesome, strong truffle scent, crispy mac and creamy sauce with strips of ham. (Just look at the cheese overflowing from the sides!! Aglio Olio ($17.9++) in the background is something I probably would never try but no doubt would be good since its from Park. Same as always though, delicious food but small and expensive portions.

much a no go. Seriously felt like I was eating curry noodles rather than pasta. The only thing that saved it was probably the fried soft shell crab. But if I were to eat it elsewhere, I would\'ve paid $10 lesser. No wonder I couldn\'t find any pictures or reviews on it. Sometimes it really doesn\'t pay to feel adventurous. Guess Im just gonna stick to the classic good old Park dishes like Truffle Mac and Cheese and Mentaiko Pasta then. ~ÊàëÁü•ÈÅì‰Ω†ÊàëÈÉΩÊ≤°ÊúâÈîô/Âè™ÊòØÂøò‰∫ÜÊÄé‰πàÈÄÄÂêé~

Finally got to try this place! ~\n<br />Awesome, creamy and cheesy Truffle Mac and Cheese there. The Honey Oat Chicken Burger was also a uniquely savoury one for me, where the chicken was deep fried well and complemented well with the crunchy and toasty bun! As for the Mentaiko Pasta, sadly it didnt really appease my tastebuds as the seaweed taste was too strong and the cream was too diluted:(\n<br />Overall, a decent and cosy ambience to dine in over a refreshing pot of tea too! üòéüëç\n<br />#sgfood #burrple #foodgasm #foodsg #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igfoodies #foodporn #foodpornsg #vscocam #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgig #food #foodies #sgfoodreviews #whatiate #onthetable #foodstamping\n<br />#sgcafe #cafehopping #nom

Mac and cheese from PARK!
YUM.
Tried  out their truffled mac and cheese and drumsticks with blue cheese dip. So good guys. Gotta try it out! 
First, the coffee art is special because is a cat...\n<br />Second, food is nice too.. people who love brunch can try out this cafe.\n<br />Lastly, the service are pretty good.
Loved the mentaiko sauce!
It\'s light and doesn\'t have a fishy taste, but the bun is a little dry. Overall, it\'s still good!
Spaghetti cooked till the right texture, with light and flavorful mentaiko cream sauce. Generous amount of prawns and topped it with poached egg which adds more flavor to this dish.
It\'s so rich and creamy, every mouth is full of truffle taste. But you can\'t eat this dish on your own, you will probably get sick of it.
Latte ‚Ä¢ Popcorn Chicken ‚Ä¢ Truffle Fries
Potatoes were a delight with caramelised onions. Mushrooms were surprising as they used shitake mushrooms with balsamic vinegar. Bacon is a bit too americanly done for my liking.. Too charred and crispy. Another tastebud surprise was the snow peas under the eggs. Very pleasant surprise that was. The hollandaise wasn\'t too overpowering. Nice!!! #burpple #foodporn #instafood #foodaffair #eggsbenedict #sundaybrunch
