Sabio by the Sea, Seafood Paella: Fresh and very tasty! Ordered straight off the Burpple social menu based on Burpplers good recommendation! 
Delicious! 
Grilled octopus on mash potatoes. The meat was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Ordered straight off the Burpple social menu. Good recommendation!
Sea scallops with sparkling white wine sauce
Salt cod with capsicum
Awesomesauce! Not like some other paella that can be quite dry. 
Caramel lava cake instead of the usual chocolate lava üëç #lavacake #sentosacove #desserts #caramel
Grilled octopus leg on a bed of chunky mashed purple potatoes. Tastes like lightly smoky fish with the texture of pork. 
Cinnamon sugar-coated churros with dark chocolate dip. Delectably crispy on the outside, soft and gooey inside. #churros #spanishfood #dessert #quaysideisle
Vanilla and white chocolate rice pudding, sprinkled with crunchy salted caramel bits.
Traditional Spanish omelette packed with chunks of potato and interspersed with strips of chorizo. I\'d have liked a bit more egg in there, but yummy nevertheless.
My favourite paella to date - the flavourful rice was moist and had the perfect amount of bite. I usually gripe about stingy amounts of seafood in my paella, but with this generously loaded portion, I wish there\'d been more rice instead. 
Fresh, springy scallops in a smooth cream sauce spiked with white wine. 
Cooked in a Josper oven, this sizzling hot plate of herb marinated pork shoulder and saut√©ed potatoes is robust with sweet and salty flavours, laced with a tantalising smokiness. I especially love the charred corners in contrast to the succulent meat.
Fluffy mousse layered over sticky caramel, with a surprise dollop of nougat ice cream hidden in the middle, and salted caramel bits on top. Lovely harmony of textures. 
Grilled asparagus topped with serano ham, a poached egg, and a paprika &amp; sherry vinaigrette. Love how the salty ham adds saltiness to the sweet spears, while the oozy egg lends moistness. 
Squid, Sea bass, mussels, clams, shrimps
Herbs-marinated Pig Shoulder served with Saut√©ed Potatoes
Grilled Asparagus, Serano Ham, Poached Egg, Paprika, Sherry Vinaigrette
Taste like something out of a can.

My weekend is complete!
Even too sweet for people who have sweet tooth‚Ä¶
The paella is really very fragrant. The paella is topped with Squid, Sea Bass, Mussels, Clams, and Shrimps. The seafood are very juicy. It was worth the risk of the allergy reaction. Fortunately, I did not had any allergy attack.

Manager kept asking if he can do anything for us but yet can\'t achieve anything, plus he gave us the reluctant face. Over promise, under deliver. üëé #sabio #emptypromises #dessert #nomnom
Delectably crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. Pairs perfectly with the dark chocolate dip.
