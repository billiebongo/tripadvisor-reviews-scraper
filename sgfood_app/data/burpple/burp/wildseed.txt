Hits and misses for Wildseed‚Äôs menu, I found their Chocolate Croissants off their array of daily bakes were pretty spot on. Though a little sweet from the rich glaze, the pastry was lightly flaky and buttery. And taking in the charming countryside allure of the space, it is a great place to catch up with friends and family over the weekend!
Coated in 3 different types of cheese (gruyere, mimolette, pecorino ), macaroni is lavishly topped with smokey bacon bits, sous vide egg and dusting of yuzu kosho for a unique tart-spicy zing. #MediaTasting #FindNewFood
One of the few desserts we had during our brunch at Wildseed Cafe, was this eye catching pandan flavoured waffle topped with Butterfly Pea Flower Coconut soft serve, garnished with grated coconut, granola and kaya. Although the waffles were way crispier than the usual sort (not really a fan), the light blue soft serve was surprisingly refreshing and not too sweet! Apart from this combination, you can choose from two other flavours - Nutella, almond flakes and chocolate pops or honey ham, mixed cheese and maple syrup. The waffles are available daily from 10am to 6pm. 
This pretty #waffle was one of the more promising dishes we had at Wildseed over the weekend. The waffles were super crispy, perhaps a bit more than we were used to (it literally cracked apart when we tried to cut it) and was topped with a really interesting butterfly pea flower coconut soft serve that paired well with the toppings of kaya, granola and grated coconut.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks Wildseed for hosting and @burpple for the invite! #burpple #burppletastemaker
Desserts here are pleasing to the eyes, just look at this striking blue soft serve! Pandan waffles are delightfully airy and very crisp; served with Butterfly Pea Flower Coconut Soft Serve that\'s a tad inconsistently icy but very fragrant, topped with crunchy granola and sweet kaya. A pity that the kaya here is too sweet for my liking.
With 3 types of cheese gyurere, parmesan and cheddar, bacon and egg yolk. The flavor of yuzu from the yuzu kosho was so subtle - almost non-existent - but Mac &amp; cheese itself was pretty decent, light and not too gelak. 
Brunch last week at Wildseed was definitely an idyllic experience set in secluded Seletar. We had a whole buncha brunchy goodness full of breads, eggs, avocados and croissants. ü•ê
Kranji mushrooms, egg, chili and very generous with grated Parmesan. Creamy and very filling, with a tinge of spiciness. Love the idea of a farm-to-table concept!
Perfect for tea break! Flakey and I loved the semi-sweet chocolatey filling. Inconsistency may be an issue though, the others felt that it was too sweet (or maybe I have a higher tolerance..?)
Place looks gorgeous. You can choose to seat outside or inside the cafe. Seats are limited so we have to share seats.
This very fabulous sweet mead made with sea water and citrus was exactly what I needed on a swelteringly hot afternoon. It is a limited edition brew. I had wanted the elderflower mead but it was sold out and shipment will only come in sept. This was recommended cos it was a rare find. I love it! It was sweet, with a hint of citrus and very subtle salt.
Wildseed Cafe offers three flavour combinations (including one savoury variant) for their Pandan Waffles ‚Äî we opted for the Kaya, Fresh Coconut and Granola. The soft serve, colored blue from Butterfly Pea Flower, was pretty decent, carrying a hint of coconut flavour which was pretty refreshing ‚Äî Kaya isn\'t the most conventional drizzle especially with ice-cream but the fragrance of Pandan worked really well with the coconut flavours overall. The Pandan waffles deviated a little from our expectations ‚Äî tasted a little savoury than being the neighbourhood we thought it would be; not sure if it the recipe was set this way to make the waffles compliment the savoury combination better. The granola provides a crunch, while the desiccated coconut helps to enhance the overall flavours of the dessert.
Quite a decent banana loaf overall ‚Äî I liked how there are chunks of mushy Banana within that provides for the sweetness and the chew, with a drizzle of salted caramel to give it a slightly punchier flavour with some contrast. That being said, I wasn\'t much of a fan of the ginger flower; sure, it adds a hint of spiced flavours to the slice, but the dry and stiff texture was a little too hard to chew or swallow.
I decided to give this Fed up Fries another chance and requested \"no salt\". When it arrived, I saw that it looked different from last time. I much prefer the previous sauce. Cos it was cheesy with mayo. This reddish sauce had tomatoes? Not sure what it was but I don\'t like tomatoes. Will request for cheese mayo sauce next time if they have it. And on the salt front, they passed with good grades! As usual, flat white was delicious. Good news! They will open up upstairs for customers during the day for weekends starting July.
Curly fries loaded with cheese, chillies, and pickled mango chutney. Sinful but yummy, though less salty might be better.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Wildseed Cafe\n<br />Address: 3 Park Lane, The Summerhouse, Singapore 798387\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #wtfoodies #foodgasm #foodstagram #f52grams #eeeeeats #buzzfeedfood #buzzfeast #thefeedfeed #huffposttaste #foodphotography #bonappetite #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #cafehoppingsg #wildseedcafe #thesummerhousesg
You need a car to get here, and the place is quite nice but very very limited indoor aircon seats.\n<br />Service is quite poor cos they seem short handed.\n<br />I came around 2pm and some of the items i wanted were sold out.
Their long black was not bad, but the flat white was much better. Aromatic with a tinge of cream, this will be my regular from now on.
It would be perfect if it\'s slightly less sweet. 
nice ambience with good music üé∂ .\n<br />#sctraveldiary2017#burpple#cafehopsg
Been a while since I was here and much has changed since then. The place has become much more vibrant as it was packed with people despite it being a hot afternoon, plus they have more food selection than before.
Maybe the prettiest Blue Pea Gula Melaka Muffin ($7.80) will do but I\'m not the biggest fan of coconut-y stuff so this didn\'t really sail in my boat.
A rainy afternoon calls for tea. And since they have some new items like the Fed up Fries, this became my tea break for Saturday. The curly fries came looking loaded and lovely. My first bite resulted in some clapping, cos it was cheesy and spicy. But as I dug further in, it became saltier. And saltier. Thankfully I got a whole pot of earl grey to wash out the unpleasant saltiness. There was no tea bag in the pot, so I dunno how long they steeped the tea for. Tea taste was weak, which disappointed me. I like my tea strong. But it was hot, which made me happy. Cos I expect my hot beverages to be HOT, not lukewarm. Lovely afternoon of live music, misty rain and hot tea. Just try to forget the Fed up (with salt) fries.
Glad I make all the way there to try it out!
Honestly this is by far the most adventurous menu I have eaten. The food here is awesome despite the unique ingredients used. I would particularly want to highlight trying their vegetarian burger, scrambled avocado roti and the ginger flower banana cake! Oh and be sure to take a walk around the place while you are there. It\'s a good break away from the buzz of city life.
I was attracted to this burger because of my love for meat balls. Turns out this is a vegetarian burger hahaha! The balls are made with fresh vegetables taken from the edible garden at Wildseed Cafe. I found the spices that went with the ingredients to give it an Indian swirl and surprisingly I found it tasty! A perfect dish for healthy, delicious and relaxing brunch!
My eggs broke the last time so I asked for them to be more cooked. But they said they couldn\'t do it. And as can be seen in the pic, my egg was perfect this time! After the initial burst of delight, my next concern was \"how do I eat this without sacrificing my precious egg?\" In the end, with surgical precision, I used a spoon to gingerly scoop up the fragile egg and put it in the hole of the bread. Then using a fork, I poked a tiny hole in the yolk and quickly directed the flow of the yolk into the hole. Success! I made a huge mess eating my masterpiece with my hands but it was so delicious! The kaya was not overly sweet and combined with the gula melaka and fresh coconut, the taste was deep and rich. Sourdough provided a chewy contrast in texture with the creamy kaya jam and soft luscious egg. I just found my favorite Singapore kaya toast. Goodbye Ya Kun!
The very excellent French fries ($11). Very crispy and pairs very well with their sambal mayo. A bit heavy handed with the salt this time, which had never happened before. Will request for less salt next time. Saw people ordering beer with their lunch. Gave me inspiration to pair my fries with beer for my next visit!
An old delicacy with a new modern twist. Shredded coconut and Gula Melaka with kaya and butter. And side? Poached egg. $9. It\'s so worth it.
Cold cuts, 3 types of cheese, poached egg with bacon, 3 types of bread. Just delicious! $28 per person.
Enjoy blooms from @poppyflorastudio &amp; sweets from Wildseed! Possibly the perfect hideaway from civilization üåøüåæ Shot with #fujixe1 üì∑
Websites stated opening time to be 9am on Sundays, turns out, 10am\n<br />Doesn\'t work on first come first served basis, instead a cafe staff (just one) walks around tables taking orders, came to me only after like, 8 tables even though I was second to arrive.\n<br />Ordered pasta and 2 coffee, and only after 10 mins the same staff came to tell me they gave me the wrong menu and pasta wasn\'t available. at 10am.\n<br />Coffee came, staff toppled his tray and nearly spilled the entire cup on me but lucky I helped grabbed the tray in time.\n<br />Appalled by mistakes already,I ordered only a cheesecake but the taste was more flowery than cheesy. Not good.\n<br />Bill came WiTH the pasta charged. Took another 10 mins to rectify.\n<br />OMG everything just went wrong from beginning till the end.\n<br />Oh well, nice floral setting is all I can say.
Housed in a refurbished colonial bungalow, this lovely cafe exudes a quiet charm that reminds you that you are away from the hustle and bustle of the weekday grind.
This area is going to be developed into a Dempsey sort of place. Heard from the people at Wildseed that phase one was opened Dec 2016. This cafe is so pretty! And they have live singing on Saturday afternoon till about 3pm. Can get a bit loud. It\'s a dog friendly cafe so this is a great place for pet owners. We bumped into a gathering of Pomeranians and poodles one sat afternoon! Food wise, I\'m not too impressed with their pastries. Tried the rosemary lemon tart and passion fruit cheesecake. Didn\'t like them. Coffee was ok. The cold brew could really help you in the bowel department! I like their juice better. Their coffee cup a bit small. I enjoyed the fries. Very starchy and so compatible with their sambal mayo. They have a brunch menu that\'s only available on weekends. The avocado mushroom thingy in the picture was good. But when it arrived at my table, the eggs were already broken and the yolk oozed out. üò¢ I was heartbroken. Later when I passed by their kitchen, I saw someone preparing the same dish and the eggs were also broken! I commented to the waiter about my heartbreak and he said that cos the eggs are half-cooked so slight movement can cause them to break. Next time I will specify I want my eggs more cooked then. I tried their French toast previously and it was not bad. Both only available on weekend. Their service staff are really friendly. I like this place.
The slice is tender beyond belief and chock full with warmth with every bite.
The [Pea Flower Coconut Muffin, $6.50 - pictured right] from @thesummerhousesg has shreds of coconut and gula melaka as fillings, which reminds me of a local favorite ondeh-ondeh kueh.\n<br />_\n<br />Even if you aren\'t a fan of these snacks, this still makes for a compelling case infusing local flavours into an otherwise typical muffin.\n<br />_
I can\'t help it...I love the grated coconut fillings within the muffin. The Gula Melaka isn\'t too sweet, just lovely!
wishing for a cup of coffee to keep my eyes open.. üòÖ
There\'s no saying no to this Blue Pea Flower Gula Melaka Muffin üòç In all honestly it\'s not mad yummy, though definitely a decent snack. The coconut gula melaka filling\'s aggressively sweetened, moist and earthy, much like a cross between a tutu kueh and putu piring\'s fillings! The muffin itself is a little dry on its own though, and we had to ration the filling to make sure we get a bit of that moist goodness with every bite.
Just a glass of simple smoothie or juice for the afternoon!
They forgot our order so the waiter kindly insisted on getting us complimentary drinks! so i had another cup of coffee and he even gave us another slice of cheesecake for free! talk about good service woohoo :-) food was AWESOME! definitely go for the fries haha i\'ve never had fries that tasted more natural, though it does get a lil salty towards the end. Pulled Pork Burger was great, i especially loved the bun! (not so much the sauce though). The cheesecake was interesting it had a really smooth and creamy texture but didn\'t come on as too heavy either so i\'d recommend that too. Coffee isn\'t the best but alright with a good meal! AMBIENCE IS PERFECT THOUGH hehe beautiful place
That mild sweetness of banana, rich in flavor within the moist choc loaf.  You\'ve gotta try it!
Had an awesome brunch in this gorgeous cafe on a quiet Monday morning üòå love the creative #brunch items including the local-inspired Sourdough Kaya Toast ($8) and healthy Poached Egg Don ($14) which had seabass and a mix of interesting grains that gave it a  delightful texture. #burpple #breakfast
This pretty little thing that tastes as good as it looks. We swooned from the gorgeous Aqua-blue fluffy interior and delicious gula Melaka flavour that exuded fragrant aromas from within. Though this place is inaccessible, it\'s somewhere I wouldn\'t mind making the effort to travel to once more.
It\'s an interesting combination here that the beef sausage is sprinkled with curry powder and lined with wild chilli sauce. Instead of the usual sauerkraut, this is served with braised onions on the side. Beef sausage itself was very juicy, so this is quite a successful marriage between Southeast Asia, India and Germany üòä 
Housed in an 80-year-old British Colonial house, this cafe on the grounds of Seletar Aerospace Park is the place to kick back and relax with family. There\'s plenty of room for kids to run around, especially with the newly built aerospace themed playground. Most of the ingredients used in this farm-to-table cafe are sourced from local and Malaysian farms, with garnishes freshly plucked from the edible garden nearby. Expect hearty sandwiches like the Pork and Krauts ($15) ‚Äî cured, smoked and slow-cooked pulled pork collar ‚Äî and The Morocano ($18). The latter features tender three-day braised beef brisket, eggplant stew and sauteed pak choi, slathered with hummus and sesame. Kids will love to snack on the Super Thin Curly Fries (from $11) that come with a side of savoury seaweed mayonnaise. Don\'t leave without having the freshly baked Pea Flower Coconut Muffin ($6.50) that is infused with natural pea flower extract to give it its bright blue hue, and a nice gula Melaka coconut filling in the centre.\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Cassie Ong
Really good scrambled eggs here - milky, smooth and moist, and made even more creamy with the added avocados. The bread was served warm and fluffy, so here\'s a light and simple breakfast done really well.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />We however all agreed it\'s a tad pricey.. And begun sharing tips on how to make great scrambled eggs at home. #eggs #scrambledeggs #sourdough #wildseed
Beautiful morning over breakfast, especially when this deceptively simple looking pancake checked all my boxes on how a good pancake should be.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Thanks to the house made butter, it\'s fragrance was evident as soon as it was served. The crisp exterior with uber fluff and moist interior was addictive, kept us digging into this again and again! The char grilled corn toppings was also fragrant, plump and smoky.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I\'ve had this twice on two occasions. It was perfect on my first visit, but this pancake on my second visit could be even better with either more butter or more maple to moist the exterior as well. Still recommended, as long as you don\'t find it pricey for something looking this simple.
Wildseed cafe presents itself as a unique dining experience with a floral studio located in its compounds. One can engage themselves in a lesson on floral arrangement while indulging in a good cake and cuppa. Situated at such a reclusive area in Singapore, the cafe offers respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. We took comfort in the Honey Lemon Rosemary Tart as well as their gorgeous breakfast spread. The bacon was really crispy and perhaps the highlight of the meal other than the cake! I\'d most certainly want to drop by again to indulge in their burgers! For a new establishment, it\'s pretty remarkable that they\'ve much got a constant influx of customers throughout the day during the weekend!
The lightly battered herbal falafel patty is slathered with yogurt sauce, pickled beetroot, carrot pesto, feta cheese and lettuce. The most well balanced in terms of flavors (and diet). Enjoy this colorful bun in their colorful garden space at Seletar Aerospace Park! #sgcafe
Although I really love zippy, bordering wince-inducing curds, I appreciated the roundedness of this lemon curd that features honey. The rosemary in the tart shell was also very subtle, so don\'t worry about this being too herbaceous. 
Crispy, fragile wisps of potato that are dangerously moreish even without the dips (soy sauce seaweed mayo and ketchup). üëÖ\n<br />A great side dish to share for both adults and little ones, though we had a hard time finishing this bowl with five of us. Might be better to get the smaller portion ($11) unless you have at least six pax (or spud monsters).
This was one of my favourite sandwiches here, along with the Indepedent Uruguay ($15) starring superb herb-kissed falafels üíö plus The Morocano ($18) stuffed with oh-so-tasty braised beef brisket. 
Made using beans from Nomad the Gallant, the flat white I had wasn\'t as robust as I normally would have liked, so I\'d defo recommend getting a double shot. \n<br />Had a sip of the sea salt caramel latte, and similarly, I felt that the flavours could have been more intense, sea salt caramel included. 
The vegetarian option ‚Äì Independent Uruguay ‚Äì featuring carrot pesto, feta cheese, pickled beetroot, falafel, Kranji lettuce, yoghurt sauce and rye bread. Carrots are steamed till mushy, and its flesh is then cooked with garlic, chilli padi and tomato reduction to give the sandwich a fresh sweetness.¬†
Luscious lemony tart topped with meringue and sugared rosemary sprigs. While rosemary lends an earthy taste to the tart, I didn\'t really favour it though Lily loves the combination.
Walking in, the decor\'s already a breath of fresh air with floral atelier Poppy Floral Studio lending lovely, magical touches to the space. And then there\'re the pastries: delicate cheesecakes, a muffin or two, handful of pastries, and coffee of course. What everyone\'s been saying is so right: the Passionfruit Cheesecake\'s absolutely yummy. Delicate, yet rich and paradoxically dense, with a crunchy sweet oat and nut topping - nailed the balance of citrus and sugar, and trust me you\'re definitely gonna want this for yourself.
The menu currently includes a selection of cakes, sandwiches and bar snacks, as well as an intriguing cocktail selection (e.g. a steaming hot Masala Chai cocktail (!!) and Kaya Martini).\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />The Seletar Aerospace Park area in general is positively glorious, and already fairly crowded despite its relative inaccessibility. Ideal for idyllic hazy afternoons wearing big floppy hats and flowy white dresses/white tennis outfits while your pet pony grazes nearby.
As recommended by many including the staff. Cutting into it, you\'ll be enticed by the lovely aqua hue and Gula Melaka coconut shreds filling. Hint of coconut permeates throughout the muffin, and best eaten when warm.
Dropped by this lovely garden cafe and enjoy afternoon tea with the girls after cycling. Limited mains to choose from so we simply gotten the Pulled Pork sandwiches ($15-$16) and curly fries ($11).
I could probably go without them! \n<br />These falafels were üëåüèº and Chef @florian_ridder has nailed it in ensuring every single component comes together as one flawless composition. /I enjoyed numerous vegan dishes at cafes in Australia and it\'s wonderful that Singapore is catching onto that ‚Äî slowly but surely. Hoping savour more tasty vegan creations this year and introduce them to my vegan friends üòã \n<br />Full review of the newly opened Wildseed Cafe at Seletar is up on my blog!

Time for breakfast, how about a different kind of kaya toast? This kaya toast here has a poached egg sitting within sourdough layered with kaya. And yes, that egg was perfectly poached - it bursted into this eggy mess with only a light touch of the knife.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />It would be perfect for my taste if it\'s served in a fluffier bread, but I love that fragrant kaya and how they\'ve fused our local favourite breakfast set of kaya toast with soft booked egg into a single creative brunch item here.
Starting the new year 2017 right, by having a great meal with foodies @veronicaphua @hiamjio and @geekyelephant. This is our post lunch desserts.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The cakes are really good. Whether it\'s the banana, passionfruit or lemon cake, they\'re not too sweet nor too sour, yet wonderfully aromatic in their respective flavours.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />What\'s not to love here - gorgeous garden deco, personable service and great cakes. I will definitely be back.
Whilst tucking into the cakes we had ordered to share, this petite pancake of about 6 inches in diameter, was brought to us, compliments of the chef. What a lovely thing it revealed itself to be.\n<br />To begin with, it smelled amazing, thanks to the house-made butter. Which\'s also the reason for the light crisp finish on the golden, fluffy pancake. Tiny cubes of the same butter and chargrilled corn kernels were used as toppings - so simple an idea but tasted oh-so-good.\n<br />Do note this is one of the choices under Wildseed\'s a la carte buffet brunch priced at $38+ per person.
Last Sunday\'s stopover at Wildseed Cafe saw us sharing their house-baked lemon tart, passionfruit cheesecake and banana cake topped with ginger flower ($6.50 each).\n<br />Of them all, the lemon tart came out tops for me despite it not having the sharp sourness I favour. I guess its crisp buttery biscuit base was exceptional that\'s why. The cheesecake was pretty light with a slight gelatinous texture. Spread across the top was a tangy passionfruit that gave it a lift. Those who like their cakes sweet and soft, should find the banana cake to their satisfaction.
Popped over with @zippyzipeng and @stormscape to Wheeler\'s Estate\'s next-door neighbour, The Summerhouse yesterday. Although the main restaurant isn\'t open for business yet (they will be by early next month), Executive Chef Florian was kind enough to treat us to a few of his housemade creations from their adjoining cafe-by-day-bar-by-night, Wildseed.\n<br />First was a round butter bread bun served with \"Christmas Market\" flavoured ice-cream (chef says it\'s inspired by the smells at the festive markets in Germany) and mandarin orange granita. We also munched on \"makronens\" (German style macaroons) and a pretty blue pea flower muffin filled with gula melaka (this is pictured above).\n<br />For my drink, I decided on a Chai Latte and found it really comforting on a rainy afternoon. There is a florist housed inside the cafe too which adds to the prettiness of the space.
SO CHIO, totally reminds me of one of those out of city experiences, like Bangkok\'s. \n<br />Coffee is from Nomad the Gallant coffee roaster for speciality coffee, and flowers from Poppy - great for lazy afternoons.

Sweet sweet sweet! üòñ
Rather soft banana loaf but the highlight was in the taste. Can distinctly taste the bread\'s banana flavour and the banana chunks add a lovely texture. Still it\'s rather small for its price and the ginger flowers are not pleasant to chew on
Luckily they do one cake right at the very least. I finally understand what they mean by paradoxically dense haha this was so incredibly fluffy yet it really was dense as well?!?!?! Mindblowing. Taste wise it was great as well and I just love soft crusts. The passionfruit flavour was not overpowering either(else it might have been too sour) so all in all it was a superb cheesecake
Loved this pork burger to bits! Succulent pulled pork with bright tomato sauce, combined with their signature cream cheese makes for a very flavourful bite. Sandwiched between crispy bread that\'s just been toasted and it\'s a winner. Oh and also what could possibly go wrong with extra bacon? Didn\'t really like the salad dressing tho it was way too sour
Texture was dense and not chewy. But the deal breaker was the toffee sauce. Think it was burnt lol. I didn\'t even finish it. Now I regret being adventurous and not trying the popular Kaffir lime choc
Again the cake was too dense tho this fared better than the financier. The coconut layer was great somehow I felt it was more palatable than the tasteless shredded coconut that went with the atas kaya toast. Would have been great with airy lemon sponge
Kaya cream was very light and though kaya taste wasn\'t strong, the pandan aroma was on point(which was great else it\'s just gonna be their kaya on financier without any twist lol). However the financier was too dense. Didn\'t quite go with the fluffy cream at all(as in there wasn\'t enough cream to moisten the financier)
I was going in thinking of peanut butter but it really was peanut cream lol sigh. And the top layer of glaze was quite tasteless if a little sweet
Tasty but a little dry. One for one mains when you book with @chopesg!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodblog #foodlover #foodstagram #instafood #sgfoodie #igsg #sgfoodblog #foodiegram #sgcafe #instadaily #igers #whati8today #burpple #EATPL

Versions of food is odd. The food tasted wierd for my tastebud. French toast and currywurst was wierd. Pulled pork texture was wierd. Utensils was not clean. Had remains of food. Not just on one but multiple of it.

They do serve mains although Summerhouse next block would offer more choices. \n<br />We picked the Pea flower Gula Melaka coconut muffin and Banana loaf for our desserts. Both were good, flavourful but didn\'t really stand out in terms of uniqueness. \n<br />One reason for our visit was for their handmade fried which were supposed to be very thin strips. However, they turned out rather normal in terms of their cut other than being chopped into short pieces. Taste was good and they were very crispy though some may find some over fried. Sambal chilli with ketchup was a good mix for dip though. \n<br />Overall, we didn\'t find any wow factor in our food. Place was beautiful especially the cafe was situated with a florist. One bit that got we puzzled was why we had to walk to next block to place our order and there was no menu for us after seated too. Felt that a cafe could do better to make its service friendlier for customers. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #fries #bananaloaf #muffin
The braised beef brisket is paired with eggplant stew, feta cheese and sauteed pak choi, hummus and sesame. The combination of ingredients is rather refreshing, with the flavours coming together as one yummy sandwich.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sandwich #braisedbeef
The interpretation of the local breakfast is out of this world. Who would have thought of stuffing a 62.5 degrees sous vide egg into sour dough bread with kaya, butter, coconut and gula melaka. You need to try it yourself to understand how good this is.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #kayatoast #breakfast
The fluffy pancake is drizzled with maple syrup and topped with grilled corn kernels. I like the addition of the corn kernels, giving it an extra crunch for a delightful finish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #pancake
These thin curly fries are very dangerous. Unknowingly, I probably finished half of it in a short time span.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg
The execution was well balanced with the scent of rosemary crowning the beautiful flavours.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #lemon #tart
It did not occur to me that you can actually transformed a sauce into a snack. The hollandaise sauce was given a gelatine coat and deep fried. It is crispy on the exterior and saucy inside.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg
It is a pulled pork sandwich with cabbage, cucumber salad, nuts, and yoghurt sauce. Initially I thought the sandwich may be too meaty but it turned out the cucumber and cabbage not only lend a crunchy bite, they give it a refreshing balance too.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sandwich #pulledpork
It is a vegetarian sandwich with herbal falafel, carrot pesto, feta cheese, pickled beetroot, Kranji lettuce and yoghurt sauce. The star has to be the falafel which is perfumed by the different herbs and spices.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #sandwich #falafel #cafe #cafehoppingsg
A comforting drink, though not the nutella I expected.\n<br />_
That refreshing and tart citronella passionfruit cheesecake, peaflower muffin with gula Melaka coconut filling, and a caramelized banana slice with toffee and ginger flower are üòçüòçüòç!!!
Its sweet and tangy taste certainly helped to awaken one\'s taste buds.¬† Really love it! (Date: 31 December 2016 Saturday) #MsJaniceEats_Pastry
üòç Finally something to look forward at my hood with new eateries sprouting out at Seleter Aerospace Park! Full review of what I had is now up on my blog (link in bio). / \n<br />My Friend from overseas says that this is a different side of Singapore that she hasn\'t seen before. I agree üòå The rejuvenation truly brings out the charm of the colonial houses and kampong days.. üè°‚ò∫Ô∏è #brunchlife #brunchclub #wildseedcafe #thesummerhousesg #burpple #coffeelovers #dessertheaven #casalapin #cafefoodsg #tslmakan #gardencafe #burpple

The texture of the muffin was just right, neither too soft or hard.\n<br />*\n<br />The Gula Melaka Shredded Coconut in the middle of the muffin bring out the  sweetness and it was nicely balance with a pinch of salt.\n<br />*\n<br />I also order a Ice Long Black that compliment perfectly with the muffin.\n<br />*\n<br />Wildseed Cafe\n<br />3 Park Lane \n<br />Seletar Aerospace Park \n<br />S(798387)\n<br />Tel: 8608 3340\n<br />*\n<br />Operating hours:\n<br />Mon- Closed\n<br />Tues to Fri- 10am to 7pm\n<br />Sat &amp; Sun- 9am to 7pm\n<br />*\n<br />#thesummerhousesg\n<br />#wildseedcafe\n<br />#burpple\n<br />#hungrysquad\n<br />#foodstarz\n<br />#eatbooksg\n<br />#whati8today\n<br />#videomasak\n<br />#phaat\n<br />#eatlikeshit\n<br />#dailyfoodfeed\n<br />#foodbossindia\n<br />#losangeleseats\n<br />#eatbooksg \n<br />#ExploreSingaporeEats\n<br />#ExploreSingapore\n<br />#eatingnyc\n<br />#damien_tc\n<br />#singaporeinsiders\n<br />#thisisinsiderfood
