Tried this as I love pork lard. A disappointment despite the 15min queue on a Saturday. Not flavorful despite generous pork lard, noodles had a very flour-y taste and the four wantons were tiny and sticky to the bite. Note: $3 version gets you more noodles and not more ingredients. 
Had a bite and want it all over again. Totally worth the price which is $2 for 5pcs and worth the long queue i waited. Highly recommended for those who\'s looking for traditional kueh. 
These Putu Pirings melted away to gula melaka, the perfect ending to the dinner we had here. 
This came from the only fried carrot cake stall in the hawker centre that also happens to sell satay. It\'s decent enough to satisfy my Sunday morning craving with soft, fluffy \"kway\" and a generous amount of egg for my $3 portion. \n<br />My dream plate of \"chai tow kway\" however, would be less healthy as I\'d like it fried with pork lard oil. I also prefer the pieces of carrot cake to be smaller and the whole dish to have loads of \"chye poh\" (preserved radish), chilli paste and chopped garlic. So far, the \"Good Spice\" stall at Pek Kio Market is favoured by my tastebuds. Does anyone have recommendations I can try? üòä\n
Super rare to find Sarawak laksa in SG! The soup was good but the prawn was too mushy and the vermicelli was a little over cooked. Still a good bowl of Sarawak laksa if you\'re craving for some. Their kolo mee was really good too!
As time passes, really good Indian Rojak is increasingly hard to find in Singapore. I was hoping this one at Haig Rojak Centre (#01-04) would be one of those rarities but it was only average. With little variation in terms of flavour between each type, the taste was pretty generic and bland. The dipping sauce appeared a little pale but at least, it was sweet and spicy.\n<br />Does anyone have recommendations for me to check out? :) 
The magic teh tarik best teh I ever drink @ #01-26 haig road food center next to the famous Mee goreng shop, my favorite is  teh cino ice ....
Normally sold out by 11am. But it wasn\'t especially nice for me..
One of the best I\'ve ever had. Generous with ingredients too ($3.50). It\'s located just next to the putu pirang stall
First time eating Sarawak laksa ($6).. Unlike our Usual Singapore laksa.. This was \"lighter\" in taste but flavourful~something new to try! üòÄ
Located at #01-62 inside Haig Road Market and Cooked Food Centre is a \"wanton mee\" stall that has been in business since 1977. Naturally, I expected it to be of some standard and although I can\'t exactly rave about it, the \"wanton mee\" was more than decent.\n<br />Their handmade egg noodles are tossed in a dark sauce that\'s got a touch of sesame oil and pork lard oil. So even if you don\'t take chilli, it\'s still packed with flavour. Prices are extremely reasonable. Our $2.50 portions had a fair amount of noodles and \"char siew\", plus a bowl of cloudy-with-stock soup with four dumplings each.
At $3.50, this bowl of noodles come with char siew and minced pork. Since young I have been going around Singapore hunting for Sarawak noodles and I have to say this bowl of noodles taste pretty close to the one I always ate! However this stall has a plus point that you can opt for the soup version or add the spicy belachan to the noodles!! a hidden gem indeed!!!
Have you tried beef satay? This was my first time! Chicken\'s my favorite hehe üòâ #sgfood
Situated at a corner of the haig road hawker centre with the white signboard stating its long history of selling wonton mee, was what that brought my attention to its chili. Be warned that it\'s chili is extremely spicy, it\'s char siew is also pretty sweet and wontons are pretty up to standard. Definitely worth to pay a visit as it is run by the older generation and they ensure the quality of every plate of noodles they serve 
Ok, that\'s all.
Imma cry now. üò≠üòçüò≠üòçüò≠üòç Ok, that\'s all.

Macaroni goreng + chicken \n<br />Hajjah Sumiati stall.
Uses ÁÜüÊ≤π (Cantonese) and homemade chilli sauce, the taste was quite like what I tasted when I was young. The noodles are specially made egg noodles but dunno from where. I added noodles for only $3.50.\n<br />‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />Kiat Huat Wanton Noodles\n<br />Add: #01-62 Haig Road Market &amp; Food Centre\n<br />‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />#eatwithroy #burpple #thefinderssingapore #hungrygowhere #openricesg #swweats #eatoutsg #foodporn #foodpics #foodphotography #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodpics #sgig #singapore #ieatisnapicrap #iphonese #8dayseat #supporthawker #hawkerfood #hawker #supportlocalsg #kiathuatwantonnoodles #wantonmee #wantonnoodles #haigroadgoodfood
Goes in the noodles then topped with minced meat and just a few thin slices of charsiew. Noodles had the que que springy texture. Aiya...looked ordinary. Then auntie asked.... want chilli or not? üîº\n<br />Yes, of course. A teaspoon of chilli... not any kinda chilli sauce. It looked like sambal belachan and had the consistency. I asked for an additional teaspoon of it. üîº\n<br />Little did I know that the main component of the dish was the chilli. Omg!! The spiciness hits you instantly. So fiery that my nose was running even before I finished  the whole bowl. üîº\n<br />Unassuming looking noodle with a kickass chilli. Enjoyed to the last strand. Thank you @eatwithroy for the recommendation. \n<br />Location : Blk 14 Haig Road \n<br />#noodles #noodlelover #lunch #jiaklocal #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #burpplesg #stfoodtrending #narratrs #sgig #foodgasm #instafoodsg #instafollow #discoversg #singaporeinsiders #eatbooksg #eatoutsg
The oysters, though plenty, were not as juicy and didn\'t taste as fresh.

We start with Kolo Mee. #kolomee #dry #noodles #dinner #geylangserai #geylang #haigroad #pork
It comes with char siew that was sliced thinly despite being rather dry but what was better was the amount of pork lard you can add onto the noodles!

It has been sometime I revisited this hawker centre to hunt for good food. This dish is one of those dishes which I personally recommend!
