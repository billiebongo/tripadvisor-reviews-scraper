Kimchi nabe set at Ootoya. The sauce/soup was very appetizing. It was a pity that there was not enough pork to finish up my rice.
Ootoya. Have you bean here? It\'s my all time favourite  Japanese restaurant.

The #breaded #strips of pork was #tender and #delicious, and the #egg and #onion were #wellmade with lots of #flavour. Don\'t know the price because it was a #treat! #Japanese #clementimall #Burpple
We said we shall replicate this at home with meat floss and maybe sesame dressing.
Made or rather grown in a Panasonic factory!
Favorite Japanese comfort food. Love the rendition at Ootoya, the chicken is marinated &amp; chargrilled first, before it\'s added to the eggs, really liked the nicely grilled flavor the process adds to the dish. üòç $20 for a set meal including green tea, chawanmushi, miso soup &amp; side pickles. 
Nicely grilled and quite tender.
