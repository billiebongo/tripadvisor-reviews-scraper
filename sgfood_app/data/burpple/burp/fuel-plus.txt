They have interesting menu if mixed Western food. For example, this Killer Mac and Cheese ($17) wasn\'t anything like I expected. They shape them into balls, coated them in crumbs and then deep fried. \n<br />And their coffee is nothing less than strong.\n<br />üßÄüßÄüßÄ‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è\n<br />.\n<br />#macandcheese #papardelle #shootoniphone .\n<br />.\n<br />üìç Fuel Plus+\n<br />16 Morse Road\n<br />#01-207 Singapore 099228

the waffle here is soft spongy type. the ingredient &amp; ice cream that comes along with it makes it so sinful and yummy
surprisingly this iced drink is strong in coffee .. and i love how it doesn\'t turn watery as the ice cube melts ..
very nice ambience, the pull pork benedict is towards sweet than salty.. can try this instead of usual salmon/bacon..
Served with warm milk instead of the usual cold ones, along with sugar syrup (which I didn\'t touch). Rather strong with a hint of acidity, gets brighter when the cubes melts further.
The plate was smeared with somewhat like a chocolate sauce which went very weird with the sausages and poached eggs. The only saving grace was the panko crusted French Toast that was pretty yummy. \n<br />Pity the pretty space with the substandard food üíî
tucked away near one of the entrances to mt faber, the entertainer\'s app brought me here and boy am i glad! soft shell crab curry was just about as awesome as one can imagine it to be and the creamy mushrooms were delicious as well. the only downside was the really horrible burnt coffee :-(
Pork Chop was tenderly well grilled with good ratio of fats and meat making it extremely juicy! The Soft Shell Crab Curry was another hit for the thick gravy which was heavily spiced and flavored. And the best drink to go with these food is none other than their Fuel Iced Tea, refreshingly blended with citrusy summer fruits, a little sweet, sour and cooling. Satisfying meal!
Nicely plated breakfast with breaded french toast, poached eggs and sausages! And this is at Fuel Plus+ - one of our newfound cafes that\'s nice and quiet.
The shell pasta is covered in a blanket medley of 3 cheeses; poking into the mixture and drawing out the pasta is super satisfying as you watch the strands of ooey-gooey cheese pull away from the pasta mixture and into your mouth. They were very generous with the cheese, beef, pasta; basically everything. The beef was tender and not too fatty, the carrots added colour; the whole dish was baked to perfection, topped off with crumbs and a lovely side of arugula. I love this dish!
Crustless homemade apple crumble served w/ buttered oats &amp; vanilla ice cream
Baked eggs with tomato sauce, saut√©ed peppers, saut√©ed mushrooms, meatballs, Swiss cheese, feta cheese, potatoes, arugula &amp; toast
Fettuccine slick with olive oil and peppered with chilli flakes; bak kwa-like bits of lardon, and a poached egg whose runny yolk aids in moistening the ribbons of pasta.
Pretty amazing: creamy yet not too spicy, and has a strong Indian spice smell. Soft shell crab + curry is a ingenious invention! 
(4/4 main dish we ordered)\n<br />Priced at 17$ which I thought was too overprice for a dish like this - bear in mind I wasn\'t expecting it to be served like this. Yet it wasn\'t a good dish.... I conclude that my overall experience was not so good BUT but but,\n<br />Truffle fries priced at 11$ on the other hand was surprisingly a big portion at the same time the only dish that\'s worth the price.  
(3/4 main dish we ordered)\n<br />Priced at 16$ it was the only main dish we had that I felt was better among the rest - it was like a safe choice decision because how wrong can eggs benedict go right? Didn\'t really like the texture of the bread though.
(2/4 main dish we ordered)\n<br />Priced at 14$ I should\'ve gone with the salmon choice though I wasn\'t rly feeling it - only because I didn\'t like this type of sausage. Other than that the scramble eggs and (pretty thin) pancakes were average but not something I would go all the way for again.
(1/4 main dish we ordered)\n<br />Price at 15$ I don\'t think it was worth it and I\'ll never step foot into the place again however I think that refuel cafe is a nice place to dine in with better food!
The drought-stricken tomyum sauce played it as safe as a quadruple-layered Huggies diaper, leaving the fettuccine\'s starchiness vulnerably exposed. Elsewhere, the wonderfully crunchy and succulent prawns were woefully overqualified for this position. 3.3/5
Hard to beat a table full of food with some of my favourite company, especially when the nosh is good! The beef ragu pappardelle was probably the standout, and the pulled pork is quite different from other versions I\'ve tried.
YAYS back at Fuel Plus again. Finally got to try the Soft Shell Crab Curry ($18) the bread that came alone was it was soft and fresh and went fantastically well with the curry. Soft shell Crab was crispy and just enough sogginess in the curry. There were potatoes in it as well. Couldn\'t finish the curry, some rice would be nice to polish up the plate. Highly recommend this! 
French toast with fruits and chocolate ice cream oozing with gooey maple syrup goodness!
Combination of sweet and russet potatoes served with bratwurst pork sausage, fried egg and sour cream. The texture of the potatoes aren\'t like those you get from marche. It was more like... cabbagey? Nonetheless the pork sausage was good and they were generous with the portion as well (:
This place was a little hard to find tucked away near HarbourFront. There were little chickens loitering around when we were there üòÇ ordered the Bacon Aglio Olio ($15) which consisted of crispy bacon (HUGE AMT) in olio based sauce topped with poached egg. A little towards the oiler side but it was all good üëçüèº their menu offers a variety of choices. Will definitely be back again. No service charge and GST. Great ambience too! üòã
„ÄäReview„Äã\n<br />Fuel up with the PUMP it Up Hotcake. Baked with apple cubes and cinnamon, the hotcake was thick and moist inside. The thickness was probably what made it slightly doughy. The sweet and sour berries complements the creamy vanilla ice cream, and there was also a slight nutty flavor from the pistachio crumbs.

The sister cafe of Refuel Cafe, this one has more food options and is surrounded by heavy foliage and wandering chickens. It is also very quiet and peaceful - just how I like my cafes. The curry was a thing of beauty though. Two rather dry slices of bread accompanied this heady mix of minced onions, Indian spices and a burst of freshness from cumin and coriander seeds. Not heavy like some coconut cream heavy curries, but more fresh and bursting full of flavour, this was made exceptional by the large soft shell crab sitting like an island in a muddy sea. The crunchy and lightness of the crab is a welcome balance to the sloppy curry! Delicious!
Really really surprised at how good this was! Really fluffy, nicely sweetened, and a lovely not over-the-top crunch on the outside - defo one of the better fancy hotcakes I\'ve tried. Love the generous topping of uber sweet strawberries and pomegranate seeds too! If they\'d use better ice cream instead of that Walls tasting one, it\'d be üëåüèª
Thick slices of Gardenia bread, dry and dense, slathered with Skippy\'s, then topped with an icy scoop of Wall\'s ‚Äî at least that\'s how it tasted. I like how generous they were with the üçåüçì though, so if they\'d iron out these kinks I\'m sure this\'d be quite a satisfying French toast.
Croissant was nothing special, eggs weren\'t as silly as I\'d like (though definitely not grainy), bacon was chewy and a little limp, and shrooms were...well, a tad too plain. Nothing fantastic, but nothing too terrible either. An ok option for brunch if you\'re around the area, but not something I\'d make the intentional trip for.
Serving up hearty all-day breakfast such as the Full Tank (above), Fuel Plus+ is definitely the place to go if you want to fill up on good food and desserts! (For my full review, check out mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg) üòã
Chocolate, peanut butter, maple syrup, ice cream, bananas, strawberries, blueberries on French toast. \n<br />Pretty much everything that\'s supposed to be in a dessert. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Something new on the list, that caught my eye.\n<br />The crab was on point. Crispy, non-greasy, and full of meat, everything you could want from soft shell crab. \n<br />The juicy cherry tomatoes bring a refreshing punch to the curry elevating the dish away from general gelat-ness. \n<br />It\'s a yum yum in my tum tum kinda dish.\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
By the good people behind Bedok\'s Refuel Cafe comes two-week-old Fuel Plus+ in Telok Blangah. Tucked away on Morse Road, between Telok Blangah and Harbourfront MRT stations, the light-filled cafe serves up affordable and hearty options for brunch, lunch and dessert. We enjoyed the Rosti, Egg and Sausage ($16) and the Honey BBQ Babyback Ribs ($19), though we do wish they could have been more generous with the barbecue sauce. Judging from the reviews on Burpple, it seems like the Burpple community also has good things to say about the Bacon Aglio Olio ($15) and Soft Shell Crab Curry ($18). Portion sizes are generous so don\'t fill up too quickly with drinks ‚Äî go for their wonderfully balanced and robust Piccolo Latte ($4.50). The service is enthusiastic and efficient, and prices are nett. \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person
it\'s brioche was blend and  rather dry. the ultimate sin was to use a rather inferior range of ice cream which had that icy  bite to it. a pity I must say or maybe just opening week blues.
Sweet pulled pork with runny poaxhed eggs when you slice it. Huge amount of rosti, so yay for me. üòã Earl Grey Lavender Cake was moist and not too dry. \n<br />Will be back for more!
So don\'t impose what you see and think on others.
PUMP it up Hotcake [S$16] baked apple cinnamon hotcake (apple stuffed inside!!), served with berries, pomegranate, pine nuts &amp; crushed pistachio. Finishing off with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with honey. Was a tad dry overall, could be improved by having the outer layer crispy! 
Checked out the newly opened @fuelplussg, located at 16 Morse Road (near Telok Blangah MRT Station). Here\'s Bacon Aglio Olio ($15), crispy bacon atop pappardelle, served with poached egg. This is not just a place for all day breakfast! üòâ
Whilst the toppings provided a crunchy breath of fresh air to the proceedings, the densely moist hotcake possessed the impatient urgency of an SMRT bus exiting the berth prematurely before its 19:02 departure time. 3/5
Apart from the usual brunch fare such as big breakfasts, pancakes and eggs, sexier choices on the menu include Soft Shell Crab Curry, Honey BBQ Babyback Ribs, Beef Ragu Pappardelle and the promising-sounding Pump It Up Hotcake - baked apple cinnamon hotcake served with berries, pomegranate, vanilla ice cream and nuts. The menu is gobsmackingly massive - you probably need to bring two separate hipster food socialite cliques to finish the exploration process.
Scrambled egg wasnt cooked perfectly but definitely coming back for the sausage.  
A generous portion of chicken leg served in a well-seasoned tomato based stew with baked potato, spinach, and toast. Perfect combination! 
Fuel Plus+ is a new sister cafe by the folks behind Refuel Cafe at Bedok Reservoir, replacing the unit which used to house now-defunct 93 Degrees C at Morse Road in Telok Blangah. A crustless homemade Apple Crumble served with vanilla ice-cream, the caramalised apples are cooked till soft, absorbing the sugary sweetness of the caramel while coated in a sauce spiced with cinnamon and sprinkled with crumbles, chopped nuts and icing sugar. Pretty apt for dessert for the classic combination it was, thought it would have totally hit the spot if the Vanilla ice-cream could be served less icy.
The people behind Refuel Cafe at Bedok Reservoir has opened a sister cafe along Morse Road at Telok Blangah, seemingly replacing the space previously left vacant by now-defunct 93 Degrees C since a couple of years ago. This new space features a slightly bigger seating area, a brighter white interior with wood furnishings as well as a larger and more extensive menu than the original outlet. Seemingly Thai-inspired in flavour, the curry was rich and thick with a little cream, moderately spicy and carried a nice hint of lemongrass flavours that helped lift the flavours of the curry. Inside, expect a generous amount of small onion chunks which I especially love (I am the sort who finishes the onions in any zichar dish), chunky cubes of lightly-fried potatoes, cherry tomatoes which burst with a simple bite and the crispy soft-shell crab. When you finish, don\'t let all the sauce go to waste; dip the crusty, toasted bread into the curry to let them soak up all the goodness, for you know you will not want to waste a drop of that sheer goodness.

Bianco Beans roasted by La Ristrettos is used here for the Flat White; medium-bodied and pretty nutty with a citrus-sy finish. Good for a perk-me-up!
A little on the hard side but overall good. Ordered with the soft shell crab curry on entertainer which i thought had an exotic sour taste. Nevertheless, the crab smells awesome and tasted good! Quite a nice place to chill over meals or coffee too.

Salmon Royale with guccamole, beef mac and cheese. Yummy!
good for sharing i find, too much to eat alone as a main.
Fluffy hotcake baked with apples within and decorated with strawberries, blueberries, pistachios(which unfortunately went soft) and a dusting of powdered sugar! The mix of hot and cold was soo good, really love the generous scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream. After a while, the taste of the hotcake gets boring though, and I felt myself going for more honey to pair with the cakeüòÇ Definitely should share with friends as it is quite large!

The crab was meaty, crispy yet juicy. I assumed that\'s a really FAT crab üòÜ\n<br />ü¶Ä\n<br />The curry was rich in spices with little cream. I was so into the cherry tomatoes so I scooped it in my very first spoon and the burst of refreshing sweet&amp;sourness eventually elevating my appetite throughout the whole meal. The chunk of onions within added sweet texture but I completely ignored the extra carb - the potatoes\n<br />ü¶Ä\n<br />What I love about this dish was the spiciness, it\'s not an ordinary curry that you\'d have anywhere else, a truly signature of fuel+\n<br />ü¶Ä\n<br />I have to rate this as 7/10 for the reason that I am not a curry person, such a big and rich dish might stop me from eating for the rest of the day üòñ but my friend was enjoying it to the max so it\'s definitely a high recommendation üëçüèª Not to forget the fresh, warm &amp; crusty toast!
