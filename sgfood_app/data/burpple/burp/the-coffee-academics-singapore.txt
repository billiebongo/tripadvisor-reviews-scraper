May come back, but just because their coffee was to my liking. This was at their new outlet at Raffles City. They were still having their soft opening when we were there yesterday. Anyway, how do I create a new location tag on IG?
The soft shell crab Pasta in salted egg yoke sauce was savoury, but portion was a little small.
Also, naturally the evil force in preventing us from trying new things. But greed and the need for caffeine prevail. Herewith, the sublime iced white with manuka. The beautiful floral notes of the honey intertwine flawlessly with the nutty accents of the coffee. Why so gorgeous. Ok, that\'s all.

And original plan got scrapped because of the rain. 🌧🌧🌧First time having food at coffee academics, didn\'t miss out on much though. Crayfish caviar was ok but not great, prosciutto eggs ben also ok only, chili corn dog was ok. Pancakes were really fluffy but honestly too much sodium bicarb 😕. Wellll but coffee was still as good 😛. #saturdaybrunch #coffeeacademics #burpple
Great food and drinks but a pity about the service! After waiting for 20\', you get a table. You order and it takes 30\' before staff member tells you that one of the items ordered is not available. And another 30\' before last items on our order list are served - so 1h to get a serving of fries! Ok they are curly, nice and crunchy but 1h is too long to wait with hungry children at the table.
☕️\n<br />I\'m no coffee connoisseur, but @TheCoffeeAcademicsSG gave me the vibes of a place that serves serious coffee for true coffee lovers. From its name, which indicates people who study about coffee, to the fact that they have their own coffee blends recognized by The Coffee Review and their own coffee farm, they seem to know coffee very well. And what you know well, you tend to do well.\n<br />☕️\n<br />Apart from their own blend of espresso based coffees, they also offer Blue Mountain and Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Each month, they also present a special coffee inspired by different countries. For the month of September, we have the Hawaiian Sea Salt Whipped Latte (SGD 8++), a lightly sweetened iced latte topped with a fluffy cloud-like Hawaiian red lava sea salt whipped cream.\n<br />☕️\n<br />Just like a good piece of meat requires very little seasoning to make a good dish, their iced latte did not have much sugar or overwhelming flavors, leaving me to enjoy the coffee as it is with just a hint of sea salt and added creaminess from the whipped cream cloud. I like it. Even though it had ice cubes added, the coffee did not turn diluted.\n<br />☕️\n<br />#freewifisg and #pokestop are available too!\n<br />☕️\n<br />The Coffee Academics\n<br />6 Scotts Road Scotts Square 02-01/02\n<br />Mon to Thu: 9am to 10pm\n<br />Fri/Sat: 9am to 10.30pm\n<br />Sun: 9am to 9.30pm\n<br />+65 6538 1940
Finally tried @thecoffeeacademics scrambled eggs with crayfish on toast. Have already been wanting to try this. Just the right portion for that afternoon snack.
YES this is the closest I\'ll get to a remedy that\'ll help me chase away the Monday blues!
Creamy scrambled eggs with crayfish and caviar, drizzled with beurre noisette, served with toasted bread and mixed seasonal green salad
I love nutty coffee and this Flat White from TCA sure hits the right notes. But the terrible customer service is stopping me from my next visit.
Truly a tower, as each pancake is more than an inch thick. Fragrant and not too sweet, the pancake tower is accompanied by a scoop of mixed berries sorbet and topped with some real berries. The pancakes go well even with just maple syrup. A definite must-try signature dish at The Academics.
This stack of thick, (almost doughnut-looking) pancakes were incredibly fluffy and lightly sweet, with a touch of salt to bring out another dimension of flavour. The accompanying whipped cream went perfectly with them, and who knew raspberry ice cream would taste so good on top of pancakes?! #brunch #breakfast #burpple #foodporn #pancakes
Ordered the Acai Bowl here, came too sweet for my liking as there was honey drizzled all over. Plus adding to that honey sweetness is the sweetness from the Granola, acai and fruits too . The coffee was good here though so I would suggest to stick to that over the food. Our other order for the stack of pancakes took almost 30 mins to arrive and was quite disappointing as well .
Liked that the salsa gives a zesty touch to the overall aspect, which harmonized quite well with the fried sea bream fillet &amp; its chipotle mayonnaise. Also enjoyed the generous portion of curly fries, exceptionally crispy and well-seasoned. Though slightly pricey, it’s still an all around awesome meal I’d crave anytime of the day. Would wish to try a Cajun shrimp version of this. Have a fabulous weekend!
Second time tasting, and is crisp and light, Jamon Iberico is the highlight (salty).. arugula bittersweet crunch balances making the dish tastily satisfying and ideal w coffee
Lovely and filling .. more fruits and this dish is ideal choice! 25min wait so best to have some food and coffee before this
Why? Why does it have to be agave nectar when the coarse black pepper overpowers the taste of anything else? Cos it\'s vegan/low GI? But this café isn\'t exactly marketed as health conscious and high fructose anyway! Is coffee made better by the addition of spice? No! It\'s large, unpleasant flakes that choke more than leave a palatable burn. But i hold myself fully responsible for making hippie coffee choices 😑
I love pancakes and this is the best I\'ve tasted so far! They were so fluffy, topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberry accompanied with berry sorbet, fresh cream and maple syrup. 
Hong Kong award-winning and most dynamic specialty coffee concept! This plate of Academic\' Breakfast was shared between 2 pax as we ordered pancakes to try too! 😆 You\'re able to choose how you would want your eggs to be done. Scrambled eggs had buttery taste. Baked beans doesn\'t felt tt they were out from the can. It was hot and had a tinge of spice/peppery taste to it. Ordered a cuppa Manuka Honey Coffee as well and it was so so smooth! There wasn\'t residual grounded coffee beans at the bottom of the cup! I need to come back here again.
Dessert menu Three pancakes along with cranberry ice cream, honey and whip cream. It\'s really tasty!!! Outside is well crunchy and inside is softy. But...it really took a long time to come.(🍴Saturday brunch time: it took 1H10min) ⚠️so before you order, please ask them how long will it take!!
☕️Latte☕️SG7.5$ It\'s new taste of coffee latte with black pepper mix. But it\'s really matching. it\'s already sugar in, so please mix it before drink. I love this♡I can recommend to you !!!
The TCA version of this French classic is made with 36-month aged Cinco Jotas Jamon Bellota, gruyère and béchamel, served with a sunny side up egg and mixed seasonal salad
Served with mango cubes and HK milk tea gelato then topped with salted egg custard sauce. Everything works well together but we wouldn\'t eat the salted egg custard sauce on its own—the sauce is super thick unlike the menu photo (that looks like it can be drizzled over the Egglet) and has an overpowering raw egg smell. The salted egg custard sauce is already piped over the dessert when it\'s served and that\'s all the sauce you really need. Enjoy the HK milk tea gelato and and mango.\n<br />One egglet down, 2 more flavours to try at The Coffee Academics.\n<br />#TheCoffeeAcademics
The citrus &amp; fruity flavors kicks in immediately with a tinge of orange lingering at the back. \n<br />The May special features the Citrus Espressoda ($8) which is inspired by Portland. Grab it to help beat the insane heat while lounging around on comfy cushion &amp; a good book in hand.
With the title \"The World\'s Best Coffee Shop\" given by Telegraph under their belts, you bet the java at The Coffee Academics is set to impress. The highly esteemed coffee joint from Hong Kong has set up its first international outpost in Singapore, serving espresso-based coffees. There are seven specially designed corners in the spacious cafe, each with its own purpose, like Cupping Corner and Hand Brew Bar. We love the Pepper Agave Latte ($7.50) — cafe latte with raw agave nectar that cancels out the bitterness of the coffee, topped with freshly ground black pepper for that extra kick. Also worth returning for is the Globally Inspired Coffee ($8) — original creations from 12 different countries that changes every month (May\'s Globally Inspired Coffee is a Citrus Espressoda from Portland).
Heard about The Coffee Academics coming to Singapore and wanted to try this out. Wasn\'t feeing too hungry so I decided to get a Mac and Cheese and a coffee (of course). Well he Mac and Cheese was recommended by the staff and its alright. When you eat more of it, perhaps you can taste more of the flavours of the kale and cheese (or perhaps I just didn\'t mix it). Macaroni was a bit dry, could have added cream to allow the macaroni to be less dry, while creating a fuller flavour. Coffee had body which makes it good. I always think that coffee should have its body, otherwise it\'s not coffee.
For such coffee, and the long waiting time, I prefer going to Starbucks. So so coffee. 
Their passion for coffee leads them to source for top quality specialty coffee beans from all over the world, roast them and create blends to bring out distinct aromas.
In frame will be the Academics Pancake Tower [$19].\n<br />Pancakes topped with mixed berries and served with berry sorbet and whipped cream. \n<br />Happy #TGIF
Academics Pancake Tower - not only was it beautifully presented, but the piping hot, thick and fluffy pancake totally satisfied our palettes.
If you love coffee, this is the place for you. They have pretty interesting coffee flavors that would pique your curiosity and this particular cup sprinkled with a pinch of pepper definitely left me desiring to sample another cup. I would actually try all their other coffees with I have a deep pocket. I\'ll return for the coffee and perhaps the pancake that looks popular among the patrons there.
Yet another failed egg benedict. The egg yolk doesn\'t flow well enough. One didn\'t even flow, for goodness sake. I just hope all these cafes would at least execute their egg benedict PROPERLY. I\'m not an expect when it comes to ham but well, the shaving of hams that was resting beneath the egg certainly didn\'t impress me. I was hungry, hence shoved this entire thing down my throat but still, this didn\'t leave me craving despite being all ravenous.
• The Academics Breakfast\n<br />• Crispy Fish Taco \n<br />• Scrambled Eggs Crayfish with Caviar
Really expensive menu but the setting is really cozy. Great place to chill and enjoy a cup of flat white with piece of cake. Highly recommend the Ondeh Ondeh cake - my friend mentioned that it\'s taste was real as she could taste the squeezed coconut milk.
But too much bubbles. If you know some knowledge about coffee, you will know what I am trying to say.
Delightful combination of light &amp; fluffy pancakes, airy clotted cream, maple syrup and fresh berries!! Only puzzling thing was the berry sorbet that was part sour and the other part confusing. Would have preferred vanilla bean! Altogether still a delightful brunch!
The enormously-filling and portentously looming structure had the heat-trapping cottony fluffiness of an ungroomed Pomeranian, whilst elsewhere the jammy berry sorbet had a Joo Chiat-esque seediness. 3.9/5
Just what my Friday needs: a good caffeine kick to start of the day with sweet promise of the weekend and that dash spiciness for an exciting Melbourne Food and Wine week ahead! 7.5bucks/serve\n<br />#FTrecommends
☕️🤓 Was intrigued by their Pepper agave latte. Thought I was going to regret as I brought the cup to my lips because the pepper smell was so overpowering. But it weirdly goes well tgt! It leaves a slight hot tingling on your lips and the tip of your tongue but the coffee is so smooth and fragrant! ☕️ #burpple #coffeetime
Visiting the Coffee Academics and had something different; Pepper Agave Latte. Love their ice creams here too, super smooth and they get it from Fat Cat Ice Cream Bar!
Fluffy pancakes that went really well with the berry gelato and clotted cream served! Best for sharing as it can get a little gelat towards the end. Ordered crayfish scrambled eggs too but portion really too small to be a serving. 💸 $52 for two mains and one coffee is a little steep, service is on the slow side but great location, vibes and coffee
Maybe we went there with too high an expectation, and when the staff told us they ran out of the food items, not 1 but 3, and not recommending any other alternatives, we were really disappointed on our first visit. If people don\'t have in their hearts to serve and make a difference for people, they will not deliver great service. This is greatly lacking in many of our service providers in Singapore. And first impressions do matter, a lot. 
Well...the coffee has a burnt finish taste which i don\'t like. But i will come back for their special latte to give it another shot. Ambience is good at least for catchup and conversation.
A very swanky café, The Coffee Academics seem to have all the makings of a big hit - nice interior, unique crowd-pleasing offerings and great coffee blends. The main draw is still the coffee hence I have my reservations about the food.
Wanted to try their January special, Chocolate Chilli Mocha, but they ran out of chocolate... So I went for the Pepper Agave Latte ($7.50). Behind the strangest combination (which surprisingly works), of black pepper, agave nectar, is a really good smooth cuppa with no hint of bitterness. Nothing like good coffee to pick me up when I am down 👌🏼
The three fat stacks of pancakes from The Coffee Academics might look better than they taste with the texture being more doughy and starchy instead of the desired fluffiness. However it had the strong buttery fragrance that just went well with the maple syrup, whipped cream and refreshing berry sorbet. So if you can get pass the texture, Academics Pancake Tower makes for a great sweet indulgence especially for those who like me, often have desserts as mains.
One of the most intense mac n cheese out there I swear. The cheese mix of gruyere and cheddar was amazing, creating an intensely gooey, creamy and rich base. And such a stroke of genius to top it with fried kale!! Adds such a lovely crunch and flavour to the already delish Mac &amp; Cheese (S$18++). It is insanely rich though, so do share it among friends or it may end up too jelak.
This was short of decent cause of its mushy centre, as in an uncooked floury mush texture. \n<br />Brilliant coffee though, particularly fond of the Okinawa topped with caramelised dark brown sugar.
This is in the dessert menu but who says you can order have this for dessert? The pancakes are so fluffy and worth the wait! 
This stack of fat fluffy pancakes is 😍😍😍. Wasn\'t too keen on the sorbet though. I polished my share off with just the cream and syrup and it was awesomeeee.
Absolutely loving the texture of these churros: perfectly crisp and not greasy; wonderfully moist, dense yet fluffy on the inside. Unfortunately they made the mistake of adding too much sugar, and adding it too early. The sugar ended up melting and clumping together within the ridges, making each bite painfully diabetic. The accompanying TCA Blend gelato was amazing though!
I can do with a piccolo latte now. Give me my coffee ☕☕☕
Love how much toppings there were: fresh creamy bananas, sweet strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, dried persimmon, pumpkin seeds, and tons of granola (that was a mouthful). The açai base however was less satisfying. Icey, followed by watery, it\'s much more acidic and sour than others I\'ve tried. Acidic like how some really sour kiwis have that cut-your-tongue mouthfeel. It\'s ok when enjoyed with the crunchy granola, but on its own it\'s a no-no for me.
I really like the welcoming open space at The Coffee Academics, very conducive for all kinds of customers who go there either for group gatherings, dates or solo walk-ins like me wanting to read a book. 
Touted as one of the best coffee shops in the world, The Coffee Academics has finally reached our shores and the brand started off as a popup at the Scotts Square Mall before unveiling a full fledged cafe space with separate islands in it serving different sensory experiences of coffee.
Coffee is about decent as the HK one and food equally bad. Definitely skip the churros. It\'s so impossibly uncooked and coated with chunky sugar granules. Needless to say this is one HANGRY girl. Can\'t wait for the food bloggers\' Christmas party later!
Yummy but pretty small portions. Food also took pretty long to come. Coffee\'s better than the food IMO. 
Time for a cup of coffee while we discuss about some exciting new stuff 😍 Trying out Manuka, caffe latte with honey~ •\n<br />指甲头发美美哒，心情也美美哒。约了老朋友商量一些很令人期待的创作和概念！
This fared better than the one I had at their earlier pop up concept but still not convinced I should pay the premium (albeit slight) premium over other cafes.
Academïcs Cinnamon Churros - these 4 sticks of cinnamon sugar dusted churros don\'t come cheap at $16. Paired with TCA blend vanilla gelato and dark chocolate fudge.  Each stick was thankfully slightly crisp on the outside yet moist and soft on the inside. \n<br />The Churros war in Singapore is getting stronger these days, fad or fat?
Being the first weekend since their official opening, I guess I would expect several teething issues. But there is to be many major improvements to be made sadly. I would agree that the coffee is definitely good (nutty blend that I really like) especially the Pepper Agave - the slightly pepperish-ness and sweetness really surprisingly to envelop itself with the coffee flavours! However, my order of flat white took almost forty minutes to an hour to arrive (and after like asking for it about 3 times 😒) The Churros was really good, crisp exterior and super moist on the inside! Paired with ice cream and dark chocolate sauce 👍🏼 The Scrambled Eggs and Crayfish in question was (literally) a question mark. Flavourless crayfish and rather stiff sourdough bread. The caviar added a strange fishy taste to the whole dish but I guess it\'s a personal taste thing.
Coffee is pretty stellar here, and it comes in a cup bigger than usual. The Flat White here comes with a low acidity at the start, but with a bold nutty and earthy body. If only the service could be improved; took them nearly an hour for this cuppa to reach the table after asking them about it for three times. One of the staff that we had approached kept telling us \"I will check for you\" but never ever came back for both times we asked. Perhaps time to review on their service standards maybe?
Scrambled eggs, Crayfish, Caviar, Beurre Noisette. Served atop a sourdough bread, portion size seemed a little small. Scrambled eggs were decent, while the crayfish needs seasoning for they were a tad bland though well complimented with umami caviar and the savoury Beurre Noisette which is spread across the sourdough.
These were actually pretty good, though it came around 20mins before the Scrambled Eggs with Crayfish despite being a dessert. Churros are crisp without feeling too dry nor stiff, well coated with lots of cinnamon sugar that I love. Chocolate sauce was thick and bittersweet, and the vanilla ice-cream is smooth and creamy. A good light snack when coupled with coffee.
Lattes and flavoured coffee isn\'t my thing, but this makes the usual Flat White boring and plain in comparison. A daring attempt on a cup of hot latte, they have added Agave Nectar into the coffee which gives it a natural sweetness that does not leave an aftertaste. Cracked pepper may sound like an odd condiment for coffee, but it goes really well with the sweetness, adding a little peppery and fiery flavour that somehow lifts the flavour of the coffee.
Medium bodied, creamy &amp; light promising a definite buzz for your buck. This flagship store is also outstandingly impressive - spacious &amp; stylish contemporary interior with state-of-the-art coffee equipments deserve a double thumbs up. Black cups &amp; golden spoon? Totally my style. Definitely returning soon to try out their Manuka which was out today.
.\n<br />What a pleasant surprise that black ground pepper actually goes pretty well with latte.\n<br />.\n<br />Finally relieved of my Coffee Academics craving because I didn\'t had the time to try during my HK trip.
The menu wrote that it\'s served with berry sorbet but it came with their homemade vanilla gelato which tasted quite bad, it was sweet and couldn\'t detect any vanilla taste. Pancakes\' texture was dense and doughy, not the kind I like.
Skip the food but the coffee here is soooo good. Try the pepper agave coffee for something smoky + sweet, I luvvit 😁
Dreaming of this now. Need to go back for more! Loving the coffee here. \n<br />#TheCoffeeAcademics
Em, not that it is just meant for professors, but it\'s HK\'s famous Coffee Academics here is Singapore. \n<br />A thick of layered pancakes topped with mixed berries and whipped cream. There is supposedly sorbet but it went MIA. \n<br />Verdict: Chio only. LOL. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/12/08/coffeeacademicssingapore/
All thanks to Burpple Tastemaker Sheryl, I got all excited upon hearing The Coffee Academics having a pop-up kiosk on our sunny island (like, finally)! I had such a lovely chat with the head barista, Clarissa, who kindly prepared an espresso shot from the TCA House Blend for my sampling and explained what goes into the caffè latte that I ordered. Three types of beans are used in the House Blend – 50% of the beans used are from Panama; 30% Columbia, and 20% Ethiopia – which have been roasted slightly darker to suit the Hongkonger and Singaporean palate. 
The layers and textures in this iced apple macchiato is said to pay homage to Mount Fuji - do you see Mount Fuji in it?
The Telegraph named it one of “the world’s best coffee shops”; Buzzfeed listed it under “25 coffee shops around the world you have to see before you die”; I just know this is my must-have coffee in Hong Kong.
Ok, that\'s all.

Nice inviting atmosphere @thecoffeeacademicssg at Scotts Square but we were given seats at the back of the cafe which partially blocked away the natural light from the wide entrance area. 😐
Guess it\'s one of the safe choice to go for👍🏻 #burpple

🔸🔸\n<br />Dark chocolate coats the interior and a piccolo swishing in it. Coffee and chocolate is a perfect marriage. There is a whole lot of gooey chocolate right at the bottom so this is somewhat also a petite dessert. The chocolate and the coffee does not overpower, infact it complements each other. A bittersweet finish without the cloyness. Now I can have my coffee and eat it! 🔸🔸\n<br />To be launched on 20th May at both outlets.

more like quail egg size. These cuties are blended with dark belgian chocolate and baked till crisp.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />With a huge dollop of hazelnut ice cream, garnished with strawberries and raspberries and manuka honey drizzling. Whilst I liked the crispy egglets, the ice cream and honey was too sweet for my liking. I would prefer to just have it with the egglets and berries.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />Personally I find the price a little steep. But it is in a central and convenient location so a good place to hang out.
The amount of honey was just right, light but you could definitely taste. Matching perfectly with the smooth coffee.
aromatic boost
Pepper agave latte is awesome !
.\n<br />I wonder if it\'s inspired by the #PPAP song. I have an 🍎. I have a ☕️. ugh 👉🏼👈🏼 Apple Coffee 🍎☕️😂\n<br />.\n<br />#thecoffeeacademics #coffee
Think the likes of ceviche, crab meat with bechamel for starters. Mains include tacos, pizza, fish and chips, oxtail stew etc. But old favorites like egglets and pancakes are still available.\n<br />🔼◾\n<br />So this is new. Striploin on skewers. 3 skewers about 6 inches long, grilled &amp; salad as garnishing. Striploin had a nice smoky marinade but I do find the cuts were alittle inconsistent. Certain parts were thin and tender whereas others were thick and chewy. Pickled radish was not to my liking. It was too sour and had a sharp finish.\n<br />◾🔼\n<br />This platter costs $16 and it is only a starter. For the mains, prices range from $20 onwards depending on what you order. Personally, I find prices abit steep but I suppose this was due to location, location &amp; location. It is worth checking out the newly improved menu if ur nearby.

Ohhhhhh Sooooooo good! Especially the HK Milk Tea Gelato.
Pancakes like pillow soft. Great combi!
🔹\n<br />Lightly sweetened and topped with a fluffy whipped Hawaiian red lava sea salt cream. It was recommended to sip (not using the straw) the top and instantly the seasalt gives a gentle salty taste (small red specks on top of the cream).\n<br />🔹\n<br />Actually I have not drank coffee with salt before and this flavor sorta agrees with me. So basically the salt cuts thru the cream and leaving the espresso to tone down the sweetness of the cream. But if one is not used to the sodium, best to mix everything up and sip using the straw. Taste exactly like iced latte with creamy aftertones and a lighter tinge of salt.\n<br />🔹\n<br />Same same but with a \"red lava\" speck difference. Thank you Vanessa @switcoffeemaster @paperlaundry @thecoffeeacademicssg for the tasting.
Not sure I liked the combination but it worked well without the ice cream.
Looking pretty in red, one might mistake it as some berry beverage.\n<br />🔼\n<br />It is actually iced espresso &amp; hibiscus blend mixed with a little honey. As I mentioned to @switcoffeemaster the hibiscus was quite overwhelming. Could not taste the espresso.\n<br />🔼\n<br />Perhaps my palate was not used to such an exotic fusion.

•\n<br />The CURLY fries were disappointing though, as the small bucket had only 3 curly fries and the rest were bits and pieces of 5cm slightly curled fries #deceiving\n<br />•\n<br />Its like walking into a salon asking for curly hair and walking out with 5 strands of my hair curled 😤\n<br />•\n<br />#bestoftheday #burpple #coffeeacademics #curlyfries #coffee #coffeeart #eeeeeats #eatoutsg #frenchfries #feedfeed #f52grams #foodporn #foodstagram #fooddiary #foodgasm #igsg #igers #instadaily #instafood #latteart #latte #nomnomnom #onthetable #potd #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporeinsiders #vscofood

I mean, look at the location\'s name! BUT! It was a super hot day &amp; I wanted something cold. So, I tried their Burnt Citrus Iced Tea (cold black tea topped w lemon, lime &amp; orange slices) &amp; I liked it!! 😄 #throwback #latergram #nofilter #sabbyisafoodie #burpple #cafe #cafesg #igsg #sgig #instadaily #instagood #instadrink #potd #sgfoodie #foodie #fooodiegram #shiok #yummy #happy #tea #refreshing #hotday #thecoffeeacademics #tca #singapore #sg

Signature TCA traditional hk egglets with mango cubes topped with a dollop of hk milk tea ice cream and heavy drizzle of salted egg yolk custard sauce.  I like it that the egglets were served warm n crisp. Theres also belgian chocolate n berries and matcha azuki. Best to share as portion is of reasonable size.

Very interesting.
Another day trying coffee at The Coffee Academics.
#thecoffeeacademics #burpple #vscocam #whati8today #onthetable #cafehoppingsg
|| One sprinkled with Okinawan sugar (strongly recommended despite the additional $1 price tag) which enhances the comforting nutty tones in the #TCA blend composed of a trio of beans, Panama Geisha, Columbine cattura and Ethiopian heirloom coffee resulting in a beverage with hints of floral in its forenotes and strong astringency which lingers for a long time。\n<br />-------------------------------------------------\n<br />#coffeeruns #coffeeplease #thecoffeeacademics #OrchardEats #instafood_sg #sgcafefood #cafehoppingsg #latteart #burpple #sipandgulp #manmakecoffee

the beef looks well-done but it was actually rather tender and very flavourful! the whole taco works very well with the guacamole and jalepenos and I love how they had some extra pesto on the side just for an extra ooomph! definitely a wonderful surprise, this one 😆 \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood  @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @thecoffeeacademics_sg @thecoffeeacademics #thecoffeeacademics #tacos #beef #brunch #breakfast #latergram

when I took the first two bites, I almost felt like I was eating canned tuna with extra seasoning added but as I took more bites, the taste of it seemed to change and was much yummier! I can\'t explain this odd phenomenon (highly doubt it is becos we waited almost an hour for our food) but well, at least it was good \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood  @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @thecoffeeacademics @thecoffeeacademics_sg #thecoffeeacademics #salad #crabmeat #avocado
pepper. now, surprisingly, this was actually sweeter and definitely much more unique than the Okinawa.

i drafted a whole story on how \"challenging\" brunch session was (it really tested my patience) but I\'ve decided against putting up the story (PM/DM me if you wanna know). so anyway, this drink here is the Okinawa Latte with Dark Sugar. Lattes are not usually my drink of choice but it sounded too interesting to give it a miss. I had a difficult time understanding how coffee here was considered good until the end of my meal, when the barista explained to us why their coffee is lighter and not as strong/bold as other cafes. I guess I can\'t appreciate this blend and would personally prefer the latter \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood  @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @thecoffeeacademics @thecoffeeacademics_sg #thecoffeeacademics #coffee #latte

Yeah, we had desserts at the Chinese restaurant but we just had to finish the meal with some coffee...and more sweets.

Decided to try these churros but it came out with a little disappointment. Too fluffy and overly moist made me wonder if the churros were undercooked. Too much sugar coated on the churros that we need to clean it off. Lastly,the dark chocolate sauce was sour. In short, quality not worth the price. Nonetheless, their coffees are good. .\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #singaporefood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instagramfood #instafood #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #foodgasm #fishyhandsatwork #thecoffeeacademics #churros
Great food although small portions... Coffee was amazing! Staff were super slow and not that helpful, overall relatively good place for coffee &amp;a small food!
Need... Of... Coffee... Weekends are coming. Hang in there.

Here we have the Fish Tacos with curly fries!

The coffee is a little chilled by the time i drank it but probably due to all the time spent photographing 😛 but its still good nonetheless. I like that they provided a glass of water for you to cleanse your palette before you drink the coffee. 👍\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #yummy #nommom #feedfeed #onthetable #food #sgfood #foodporn #latergram #foodgram #foodie #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #TSLmakan #singaporeinsiders #instafood_sg #igdaily #igers #igsg #8dayseat
We had the Crayyyyyfish and scrambled eggs with caviar. $23. Silky eggs and so yummy!
Available at @TheCoffeeAcademics\n<br />Eat slowly coz the crab meat got tiny bits of shell in it. Couldn\'t taste the dressing. Crab meat quite fishy. But lucky got avocado to balance the taste.\n<br />|\n<br />The Coffee Academics\n<br />Address : # 02-01 Scotts Square, 6 Scotts Road, Singapore 228209\n<br />Tel : \n<br />Open : 9am-9pm\n<br />#TCASG #PickatSG #Pickateer #YummyPin #8DaysEat #OpenRiceSG #InstaFood_SG #Burpple #SGIG #InstaSG #ExSGCafes #ExploreSingapore #TSLmakan #EatOutSG #PhotoMoolah #IGerSpotLight #SGFood #IGers #FoodPorn #Food #InstaFood #Singapore #SingaporeInsiders #SGFoodies #EatBookSG #WhereToEatSG #YelpSG #OpenSnapSG

Finally gonna do something about my hair yay!
.\n<br />How I missed the days where there\'s \'Taco Bell\' to sell tacos and burritos at fast food rates.
Pretty delish and at the same token pretty expensive.
