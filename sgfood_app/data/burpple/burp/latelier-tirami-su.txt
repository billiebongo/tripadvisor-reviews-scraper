Classico Tiramisu was moist, fluffy and light. One of the better ones around. Looking forward to try their dark cherry tiramisu the next time round. *all to myself! i don\'t wanna share*
Popped by for their famous tiramisu. I liked the original tiramisu best, the green tea one didn\'t have enough of the matcha kick that I wanted. 
Always my go-to place for cakes and tiramisu whenever I need something to impress. I got their pandan tiramisu for this boy I liked one day, and he\'s my boyfriend now. See.. It\'s that good.
The Creme Brulee version is only torched upon order. Crack through the thin caramelised crust into the soft base, with flavours of butterscotch and salted caramel.
This place has been on my bucket list for the longest time but slowly forgotten until I saw danielfooddiary\'s post recently. And I have to agree that this is surely one of the best tiramisu around! U can tell from the photo how moist it is, with just the right ratio of ladyfingers to mascarpone. The bittersweet taste of kahlua is also clearly evident, which I find usually less prominent in other tiramisu cakes I\'ve had. Overall this didn\'t feel too heavy on the palate, and I can easily finish 2 slices on my own!
The possibilities are limitless. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/07/23/lateliertiramisu/
Light, fluffy and very intoxicating (aka alcohol-soaked). Tiramisu at its best (Classico) and I love the brandies cherries version too!
[ORANGE RED CURRANT ICED TEA S$6] - need some cold ice tea to cool off after running errands!
The perfect combination, who can resist?
Thin crackling creme brulee layer with their signature classic tiramisu below.
Decided to give the classic tiramisu a try after a good impression of the lychee tiramisu. This was a disappointment though. Don\'t get me wrong, it definitely is better than most tiramisu\'s outside, but the bottom layer of fingers were a little dry and it would have been better with a stronger alcoholic taste. Still not too bad though!
This was really good! Even better than my fav pine garden\'s lychee martini cake(that doesn\'t have much martini taste now). Although the cinnamon sprinkled on top would take you by surprise initially. I must say the taste of lychee liqueur and cinnamon eventually blended well together!
Coffee tasted good but chai taste wasn\'t noticeable at all. Unique since most people make chai tea instead of chai coffee. Would have been better if they had added real cinnamon powder rather than one stick, although I must say it looks quite cute.
A lil more of alcohol will be better. 2 coffee for $7 from 3pm-5pm
Cafe comes wif open concept kitchen. Love this brulee tiramisu created for their 1st anniversary. A must try i would say!! Yums!!
Juz enough seats for 10people at a time, it was fully filled up when I arrived around 7.30pm for some after-dinner dessert. Tiramisu frm $6.90 onwards
The lychee-alcohol combo never fails! There are real bits of lychee in the tiramisu and they go really well with the cinnamon powder.
A pity some areas were totally dry and there wasn\'t much taste to them. For now, Poulet\'s tiramisu still wins hands down in terms of its taste as well as its price and portion. :)
I love desserts. All kinds. \n<br />Pandan Tiramisu ~ I am drawn to its simplicity. The cake was infused with the sweet aroma of Pandan, which goes well with the mascarpone cheese. If only atap seeds can be added to this dessert, it would be perfect!
Stopped by the place for a quick bite. Delicious,  tasty slice if cake.
One of the best tiramisu I\'ve tried, another good one is from 2am dessert bar. 
The search for the perfect tiramisu has officially ceased. I\'ve found my favourite; not in a Italian trattoria or ristorante, but a tiny hole-in-wall shop located basement of The Central.
Review of L\'Atelier Tiramisu up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com #dessert #sgfood #tiramisu
Craving for desserts after Mookata! So another impromptu dessert place re-visited because they are so so good + having green nails must eat something green too! [Pandan Tiramisu S$7.20] - if you ask me the taste, it taste like Bengawan Solo\'s Kueh because of the flavourful pandan, not too overwhelming, fragrance is just nice + moist cake. I wanted to order another one but managed to stop myself from doing so.
Is this the best combi ever? Lychee Tiramisu! Fallin\' in love with it #instavideo
Tried all the 4 flavours and Lychee Tiramisu tops my list, followed by Matcha, Dark Cherry and lastly Classico.
Back for the awesome tiramisu! Dark cherry and Lychee tiramisu. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This one is personal. The owner of this place was my Platoon Commander in the army and I never knew he had this side hobby of tiramisu making. Given the ubiquity of this dessert across the world, he was certainly bold yet innovative to create multiple versions of the same dish in different flavours. The green tea variant was my absolute favourite, a bittersweet symphony of flavours and textures. It was smooth, creamy yet not overtly saccharine. The dark cherry\'s greatest selling point was it\'s alcohol-soaked sponge fingers and the distinct cherry taste that seeps in towards the end of the taste test. The original felt a little blah in comparison to the other more interesting flavours, but it\'s certainly no pushover. The cocoa powder was the most conspicuous of the lot, and for someone going for safer flavours, this sure stands out as a generic crowd pleaser. 4/5 #lateliertiramisu #tiramisu #matchatiramisu #dessert #secretlifeoffatbacks
L\'Atelier Tirami·êßSu (The Central at Clarke Quay B1-09) featuring the Matcha Tiramis√π, perfect for the green tea lovers. The matcha cake carries a sweet green tea flavor, yet it holds the characteristics of a classic tiramisu. Marie and myself aren\'t tiramisu lovers, but we both favor the Matcha over the former Classico. \n<br />There are also two other flavours, Lychee and Dark Cherry (not featured) which I believe most girls would enjoy.
L\'Atelier Tirami·êßSu (The Central at Clarke Quay B1-09) The workshop sells nothing else but just tiramisu. And of course beverages, such as coffee and tea are available.
Bought the lychee, classico tiramisu and flat white, and here\'s my verdict:
L‚ÄôAtelier Tiramisu is a new kid on the block, serving up one of the best Tiramisu in Singapore. Translated as ‚Äúthe Tiramisu workshop‚Äù, they have introduced four flavors, all laced with various types of liqueur: Classico, Dark Cherry, Matcha and Lychee. Here\'s a photo of classico.

Translated as \"the Tiramisu workshop\", L\'Atelier Tirami S√π specialises in just this one item, and is arguably the best tiramisu in Singapore. Crowd favourites include: the Classico, gorgeously light and aromatic; the Dark Cherry, great for those who love intense liqueur and cognac notes; and the Lychee for those eager for an unconventional exotic twist ($6.90 each). To make the experience complete, enjoy a beautifully made cup of coffee along with your tiramisu. It might interest you to know that the coffee used in the tiramisu is pulled from Liberty beans!
The tiramisu are so yummy... thumb up... top:lychee bottom: classico #dessert

Wanted to order coffee but was tempted by their tea set!\n<br />[Rose Petals tea set - iced] S$6 - what makes it special is that the ice cubes are made of tea, and they make you another cup of hot tea to pour in the cup of ice cubes and u may add sweetener. Love their presentation! And the tea is very nice, light &amp; fragrance. Good for after-meal!

Their Classico Tiramisu! One of the best I\'ve tried by far ‚ò∫
One for the kids! This Babycino is topped with colorful marshmallows!! üë∂
It‚Äôs torched layer certainly adds a unique texture when biting through! If you don‚Äôt already know, this stall is by far the best place that serves tiramisu and with the variety of high quality flavors, one could wonder how they could even top themselves each time! I‚Äôm really amazed!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#lateliertiramisu#cake#tiramasu#tiramasusg#pastry#unboxing#tiramasucake#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Sometimes, simplicity may be the key to making good tiramisu (this comes from experience); it\'s a pity that most places I\'ve tried butcher this dessert by being too fancy with it.
so good üò≠
From the left to right, pistachio, lavender earl grey and matchaaaa! With a caramel latte! The pistachio one was alright nothing much but all the tiramisu are very soft and light! You can taste the alcohol in it! The lavender earl grey has a pretty strong blend of lavender and earl grey! Also the sponge cake was soaked in alcohollll so good! The matcha one was good too! They\'re not too sweet either! The prices of each slice are $7.20-$7.50! The latte was alright and it comes with a biscoff. Will come back for the tiramisu ‚ù§
So... guys out there, u know what to do when u bring girls out on a date üòõ // Classico vs Lavender Earl grey tiramisu and our vote goes to the latter! üíï
Still loving their tiramisu‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèªüòãüç∞
One of the best tiramisu cake I ever eatenüíñ The cake is soft &amp; moist with a strong coffee taste. This definitely cheer me up~ #tiramisu #tiramisucake #caffeine #caffeinefix #coffeelover #sgcafes #burpple
Probably the best in Singapore!!!\n<br />I can\'t decide whether it\'s the liqueur or the moisture.. Maybe it\'s the wet-tasting goodness from deep within.\n<br />It is fluffy and spongy yet disintegrates at the touch of your tongue.\n<br />And if you don\'t feel the pinch in your wallet, have a huge mouthful (one third to half a slice) and enjoy the explosion (I would like to call it fireworks) happening inside there!
More pictures of the yumilicious tiramisu 
Lychee tiramisu, classic tiramisu and matcha tiramisu! Love the matcha the most. Simply divine! 
Enjoyed both the matcha and original tiramisu! 
Still prefer the usuals matcha &amp; lychee.
