Opening within the revamped The Club Hotel along Ann Siang Hill, The Disgruntled Chef at Ann Siang offers a chic, sexy fine dining experience and a relatively different menu its original Dempsey outlet. Start off with the heavenly Truffle Brioche ($12), served warm with a fluffy texture and surprise coins of nori butter. For the mains, opt for either the indulgent Maine Lobster and Chicken Pot Roast ($56) or the uber tender Korean-inspired Crispy Beef Short Ribs ($38). End off the experience with their Chocolate Croquette with Coffee Jelly ($16) and be surprised by the burst of oozy chocolate sauce as you bite into the fried croquette! Bookmark this for your next special occasion.
The tanned and buttery cod, after taking heed of advice from social media outlets on the dangers of sun exposure and incredible merits of cold-pressed juices and the like, dons a chic veil made from its own skin whilst slathering itself with a smooth and potently veggie paste. 3.8/5
Bearing similarity to mayonnaise, the tangy sauce Gribiche cut through the richness of the creamy bone marrow, lest it overwhelms. Mop it up with the accompanying crusty sourdough for a rustic finish.
Here, thin slices of raw wagyu are uncharacteristically garnished with crispy shallots and creamy egg confit, before reinstating the Italian touch with sharp Parmesan shavings. \n<br />While the cep pur√©e tasted wonderfully earthy on its own, it seemed rather out of place in the ensemble, of which I felt could use a little more zing. Nevertheless, its sweet, fresh flavours still make for a delightful start to get the meal going.
However it was the tender Pork that was definitely the highlight for this dish! (Duh) Arriving in those fancy white curly leeks fennel shavings and with a aromatic fragrant of the Kurobuta pork.... Hmmm... Soubise (onion) sauce was drizzled just before tucking in and it elevated the whole aroma. \n<br />The black truffle risotto was slightly disappointing, with faint amount of truffle taste and only came in subtle amount mixed with mashed potatoes.
One for the berry fans ‚Äì the cooked strawberries are succulent and pleasurably sweet while the Frutips-esque berry jellies will make you feel like a candy-grubbing annoying eleven year old, and together they distract you from the other comparatively lowkey elements like a big-ass red feather fan wielded by a dancing headless chicken. 3.8/5
Essentially a Phua Chu Kang-haired pork cutlet with a delectably crispy scalp and strong torso, resting on a mattress of truffley crunchy barley. 3.7/5
Call it what you will - garden on a plate or sophisticated take on the beef tartare, this meatless appetiser is definitely not your token option for vegetarians. In fact, you might find yourself wanting more of the compacted goodness of juicy-sweet tomatoes and compressed watermelon, partnered with homemade togarashi, yuzu mayo, and kombu for a vibrant flavour burst.
A simple, yet decadent starter to awaken those senses. With black truffle paste generously worked into the buttery swirls beckoning to be slathered with umami nori butter, this proves a winning combination and a total flavour bomb. \n<br />Texture-wise, it was a little doughier than I\'d have liked on the inside - a gripe comparatively minor after weighing in all its merits.
A fine specimen of a modern #classic done right - flavours well-harmonised and the Asian-inspired nuances did not seem forced. The clever addition of homemade pandan syrup, yuzu, and fresh rosemary gave it an aromatic lift while keeping the essence of this refreshing classic intact. \n<br />Now, this would be the perfect liquid therapy for the impending midweek.
I need some sweet &amp; strong Chocolate Croquette with Coffee Jelly,  together with some Sumatra Coffee and Kahlua (as its the last day of this week!!!) The Chocolate Croquette didn\'t look what they seemed, bite into one to unleash oozy chocolate from its crispy shell. SO DARN GOOD. (On the side note, Burpple released their ridiculously Sexy September Ooozesome Guilde, full of oozy goodness,  SLURP!)
If crustaceans and fowls haven‚Äôt been dating before, they certainly should start exploring the possibilities. The lobster was plump and sweet whilst the well-done chicken had the most happily crispy skin, and when they came together on a plate ‚Äì along with respective BFFs earthy bittersweet mushrooms and dear baby egg ‚Äì the odd couple somehow made a harmoniously blissful pairing SDU and Tinder can only dream of creating. 4.2/5
How? You might ask? As the first dish to be served for the night, one whiff of the strong truffle and bread fragrance primary set our tummies all growling while wiping our saliva away while capturing its beauty. \n<br />Despite the shooting, the Truffle Brioche remain pillowly soft and warm, it was a good welcome and start to our meal at #thedisgruntledchef\'s new branch at Ann Siang. The nori butter on the hand, was outstanding. Slabbing some onto the brioche elevated the whole taste.
Essentially an epic cinematic romance interpreted as a classy dessert ‚Äì you have the aromatic and potent Kahlua cream as well as the arrestingly gao liquorice-esque bitter coffee jelly setting a decidedly adult tone, the dessert is symbolically soundtracked by a dramatically visual musical note, and with the croquettes the proceedings climax with not one but three creamy chocolate ooze money shots (ahem). So magnificent, the slender chocolate is curling in delight. 4.2/5
Chunky fleshy tender chicken matched with bouncy lobster meat, melt in your mouth field mushrooms then topped with a pair of cute fried quail sunny side ups.
More accurately, it is a chocolate lava-oozing croquette. I like how textures are being experimented in this dessert - coffee presented three ways: Coffee jelly, Sumatra coffee cream, and kahlua (coffee liqueur) -, each one bringing a different (and potent) nuance to the plate. The perfect option for chocoholics and coffee addicts alike.
Almost nothing in the world has quite the charm of what fried food and chocolate can bring, so why not combine them together into one dish and serve it out? These small little fried balls comes bursting with gooey melted Chocolate that is contained within when poked, and the Kahlua and Sumatra Coffee Cream works so well to bring that alcoholic theme out in this dessert to bring that premium feel while you try to neutralize that chocolate sweetness with other things that is on the plate. Coffee Jelly was really soft and springy, yet carried strong caffeinated flavours that triggered the kopi addict in me.
Dessert time and lots of laughs with fellow #BurppleTastemakers. Hand model courtesy of the lovely Michelle!
Pistachio Sponge, Burnt Marshmallow, Basil, Lime Meringue. An unassumingly named dessert, this was a party in the mouth. There is so much going on here from the flame-torched marshmallows which are semi-melted, sticky and sweet, the zesty like flavours in the dense meringue, the earthy yet nutty Pistachio sponge which was fluffy and the light mascarpone to be spread on strawberries, the various elements went so well together that it\'s hard to describe the experience holistically. But if you do have a chance you got to check this one out because this is how good it is!
Spiced Panna Cotta, Fennel, Amaretti. Pour in the jug of Orange sauce before enjoying. The orange sauce carried a rather soothing and cooling flavour instead of being too citric, while the spiced pudding seemed to be carrying the taste of Indian spices. There was a hint of alcohol in the orange slices, though it does not come across as particularly strong.
Two unlikely things that came together specially for this dish; a crustacean and poultry served with fried mushrooms, fried quail eggs and parsley. Chicken was tender, succulent with a crisp grilled skin that\'s all juicy and everything wonderful, though comes with bone-in while the lobster is plump and meaty being fresh. While the eggs seemed a bit out-of-nowhere here, it\'s the crowd pleaser that flows and screams egg porn when poked on.
Decidedly swankier than its Dempsey flagship, this new branch doles out an elevated surf &amp; turf with lobster as its Maine star. While the elements were all well-executed - juicy claws, succulent chicken, field mushrooms, quail eggs, and parsley frolicked in a lip-smacking reduction -, I thought the flavours felt disjointed rather than complementary.
Black Truffle Barley Risotto, Fennel Shavings, Soubise. We were all taken away by the aroma of the huge slab of Kurobura Pork when it first came, and the pork indeed shone with its premium cut of meat that felt very well layered out; not too fatty but not too lean, having a well-balanced texture from one end to the other. Drizzled in a Red Wine Soubise (an Onion sauce with Red Wine reduction), there is no doubt on how luxurious the dish tasted, but it somehow got into the way of the creamy and cheesy Barley Risotto that was hiding beneath the pork collar. As barley was used for the risotto, it was also noted that it seemed harder for the sauce to be absorbed into the risotto somehow hence it felt as though there was a lack of flavour. Still, a dish that is a display of the effort from the chefs, from plating (the chefs got inspired by photos posted on Instagram) to the flavours that runs through in this dish.
Sweet Pea Pur√©e, Ikura, Sea Beans. First of the Big Plates and it already blew me away so badly I was looking forward for all the remaining dishes! Had quite a number of Miso Cod dishes but the quality of the cod was superb; buttery, smokey and savoury in all the right degrees, the marination did not overwhelm the original flavours of the fish; instead supporting the main character of the show. Pea Pur√©e isn\'t my thing for how green it actually tasted (you might love it if you are a pea lover though), but the dehydrated fish skin (?) was so crisp and carried that light hint of saltiness was so addictive especially with the popping of Ikura which injected the umami factors into this dish. A dish that is highly recommended in my humble opinion at the very least!
What seemed like a conventional choice turned out to be the most stunning of all. Upon savouring our first bite into the smoky, succulent flesh, the whole table fell silent. Words are superfluous when flavours take over. Tastemaker Xing Wei and I could not stop gushing over those delightful orbs of ikura. In the mouth, it exploded to release fresh briny goodness and gave the cod a savoury depth.
Leeks don\'t usually take the front stage of the dish, but here it takes over the bone marrows to be in the spotlight. Coming with three slices of toast, spread the toppings over them, and you would realise that the bone marrow flavours are really subtle here; taking a back seat instead. What comes to play is the caramalised onions and leek which gives the toast some natural sweetness, alongside the croutons that give it some crunch. 
Cep Pur√©e, Egg Yolk Confit, Crispy Shallots. Think about thinly sliced Wagyu Beef in sashimi-style here, with crispy shallot rings that taste really similar to onion rings. Spread the egg yolk over and it enhances a dish by giving the raw beef slices yet another dimension of flavour.
Talk about Tartare and usually the first thing that comes to mind would be tuna; The Disgruntled Chef had made their own twist by making the Tartare a vegetarian one by using tomato and watermelon instead. The tomato and watermelon combination was a rather refreshing one from the tart tomatoes and juicy watermelon, topped off with homemade tougashi (Japanese Seven Spice Powder) crisps, a Yuzu mayo and Kombu
Served with Nori Butter, the Truffle Brioche was served warm and was fluffy and soft while carrying short whiffs of earthy Truffle flavours within its many layers of swirls. The accompanying Nori Butter was pretty interesting with its smooth texture, showcasing the quality of the butter used with its premium feel speckled with salted seaweed that carried a subtle Tao Kae Noi flavour that makes it a tad addictive.
This was absolutely delicious! The juicy, well-marinated Beef Shortribs were coated with a light crust. I loved how the tart flavour of the white kimchi helped to cut through the fat. I still miss the Crispy Lamb Shortribs on The Disgruntled Chef @ Dempsey Hill\'s menu though. Can\'t wait to check out the new menu when it\'s launched. #yummy #foodporn #burpple
A refreshing concoction from The Disgruntled Chef. @debbieyong and I are off alcohol for the time being. @jillyeats &amp; @nnonsequitur could barely believe their eyes to see us chilling over a non-alcoholic drink. #sgfood #yummy #burpple

Oh I mean TGIT because tomorrow is a public holiday. And just in case you are thinking of a nice place to dine to celebrate the long weekend, here is one:\n<br />.\n<br />Chilean White Cod ‚Äî$38\n<br />Creamy Normande sauce brought out the flavours of the salted cod with scampi butter. And if you love cheese, ought to try their Gruyere Cheese Souffle for sides too.\n<br />.\n<br />Just because every occasion deserves a celebration.

You can find seafood such as barramundi, clams, mussels, shrimps, squid swimming in the red sea. For a fuller enjoyment of the delectable broth, dunk the rouili toast into soup to soak up the goodness.\n<br />.
Gimme more!!
The star has to be the apple that is not too sweet and has a good crunch to it.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #tartin #appletart
The gruyere cheese and caramelised onions worked in harmony to develop a memorable experience complemented by the the Chardonnay fondue.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite
Loving the mini touches of greens that help to cleanse the palate after a very lardaceous affair of Iberico Pork Collar at @TheDisgruntledBrassierie.
There are Remy Martin cherry compote, cocoa rice crisps and kahlua ice cream.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #thedisgruntledchef
I like the Chocolate Fondant ($18) among the 4 desserts we tried. The chocolate fondant has a slightly crisp exterior, giving it a nice texture contrast. The bittersweet chocolate flavour is beautifully paired with creme anglaise and pistachio ice cream for a harmonize finish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #chocolate #fondant
The richness of the peanut butter miso kind of masked the taste of the foie gras, losing the focus of the dish. Saying that the black current gel and poached grapes gave a refreshing touch to the dish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #foiegras
The refreshing dessert is also a good choice after a heavy meal if you want something light to round off the dinner experience.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #thedisgruntledbrasserie #lemoncurd
Resting on top of the salted cod brandade is the perfectly cooked Chilean white cod, moist and buttery. I also applauded the use of the normande sauce which complemented the fish excellently.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #codfish #thedisgruntledbrasserie
The al dente pasta was coated in a mildly spiced chilli sauce that gave the dish an extra dimension. It also paired excellent with the shrimps and crabmeat.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #squidink #pasta #thedisgruntledbrasserie
Another dish that delight my palate and impressed me. It will be perfect if the pickled cucumber has more zest to it.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #salmon #thedisgruntledbrasserie

All that porky goodness.

It was ooh-la-la!
The layer of crispy scales gives the moist snapper an additional coat of texture enjoyment. This is further complemented by the light but yet flavourful fondue.
While the endive, pear and red cabbage add crunchiness to the whole dimension, I find that there is too many things going on the plate, shadowing the main cast. I also felt that the bitterness of the red cabbage kind of throw the balance of the dish off.
The tender and flavourful beef is paired with white kimchi, spicy kimchi mayonnaise and soy glazed baby potatoes. I thought I tasted fermented beancurd but after checking, the familiar taste actually comes from the gochujang used in the braising jus.
It also comes with black charcoal bread chips. I prefer to enjoy the full flavour of the steak tartare itself but if you are worry of the rawness, I would recommend having it together with the bread chips.
The chocolate fondant is moist and rich but what stole my heart is the banana fritters. The banana fritter coated with crispy rice is my first encounter and I really love the rendition at The Disgruntled Chef. This is accompanied with the house made dark rum banana ice cream without any additives.
The puff pastry chips, vanilla creme, formage blanc ice cream, looks so simple yet so delicious.
The sweetness of the tomatoes is dressed with black olives powder and oak smoked olive oil for a full flavour with the cucumber lending a refreshing touch. A worthy note is the oak smoked olive oil, which is smoked in house.

The Disgruntled Chef makes it even better with a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese!
Beautiful porcine Flavours with some muscular intensity from the braising process, coupled with a baby smooth puree and a rustic sweetness from the daikon to complete the gastronomic story :)\n<br />#porkcheek #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #thedisgruntledchef #carrotpuree #daikon
