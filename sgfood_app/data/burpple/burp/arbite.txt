Very big portion with generous bits of bacon !\n<br />It\'s quite tasty but can get a little jerlat with my side of super awesome salted egg fries 🍟
Thick patty!\n<br />With onion rings and sunny egg👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 and thick cut fries \n<br />Nothing to complain about esp we could use the Entertainer App here!
So rich, so sandy, so high in cholesterol 😍\n<br />With curry leaves and cut chilli 🌶 \n<br />💋💋💋💋💋\n<br />Full marks for this salted egg dish
These fries taste way better than it looks. Crispy and well seasoned. Enjoyed it with the basil sauce that came with it!
Loved the scrambled eggs and that it came with a mini jar of kaya and butter to go with the toast! Service was amazing. Definitely will be back!
this is a dish u have to wait quite some time for. too salty for my liking. but the cream sauce is delicious!
With Deliveroo, having freshly made pasta from Arbite is now possible in the comforts of my own home. Despite the delivery, the squid ink tagliatelle came with an abundant amount of seafood and was still warm. Overall, an equally satisfying takeaway home dinner as if I was right there at Arbite!
Couldnt find a place for dinner at 7pm in serangoon gardens without excessive queuing and stumbled across this cafe. Food turned out to be pretty decent, their salted egg yolk fries were soo good(must try!). The drink i ordered, watermelon cooler, tasted somewhat like Boost\'s watermelon lychee crush😂. On to the main dish -salted egg pasta. It was okay, pasta was slightly too soft but the sauce was generous and the soft shell crab was crispy. Maybe since I dont really like the taste of crab, I didnt particularly enjoy it, but it is worth a try!
\"Arbite (ahr-bahyt):  An intrinsic honesty to the word. This permeates everything that we do and serve. E.g.: quality food and drink, warm service, fair prices.\"
Seafood Tagliatelle, Marlin &amp; Mango and a hot chocolate! Also, they are selling homemade gula melaka kaya with no preservatives and additives! \n<br />what\'s best was the entertainer app! 1 for 1 mains!
The salted yolk gravy was thick yet not too heavy on taste, so it wasn\'t jelat. Penne is the perfect pasta for this dish as it soaked up the gravy very well. One of my favorite dishes here. The portion is quite large for the price but I\'m not complaining :)
Not the traditional kueh pie ti. They used shredded chicken breast braised with buah keluak.
Not only do they serve delicious savoury dishes, their sweet dishes are awesome too ^^!
Their Salted Egg Yolk Fries were pretty good though they are best eaten while the crisp is still there.  Better to share as the serving is big. \n<br />Service from both staff was awesome as well!
The cake was so dry and crumbly. Only the fudge on the surface saved it. Well, at least the ice cream was ok and came with a nice biscuit crumble. 
Smell really nice but taste wise, hardly any tom yum taste! But the fries were fried well. Most importantly is the dip! Goes SO WELL with the fries! We even had a second servings 😄
Nice and cheesy but might be too heavy after half the dish. The sauce went well with the crust. 3.5/5
Fusion salted egg crab pasta. The sauce was too funny for the salted egg to stand out in the dish. The crab was nice and crispy. The pasta was a little soft for my liking. 3.5/5 
At first bite, the fries were great! But the sauce was not as flavorful after a few bites. Also, the fries are good if you like McDonald\'s style fries. It\'s skinny and crispy. 3.5/5 it is a little far so I will probably not travel again to have it 
Salted egg fries ($8) Served piping hot and crispy. Salted egg evenly coated the fries. So sinful but so satisfying! 
This was yesterday\'s #brunch situation with the Superheroes 😊 those salted egg yolk fries 😱😋 #burpple #foodstamping #foodporn #foodspotting
I had ordered the Salted Egg Crab Pasta. We arrived early, kinda 7ish and it was still delightfully empty but there was a bit of crowd from 8 onwards and it was hard to chat and all. Haha. The pasta was good, i liked it cus it really tasted like salted egg and they didn\'t save on the gravy, though i would have preferred a bit more ingredients for the pasta. It only came with some salad veggies as dressing and curry leaves inside. But they do give also half a soft shell crab. 🍳 The portion was pretty good and i didn\'t finish my pasta. My friend ordered the burger and i think it was kinda messy to eat but he seemed to enjoy it. You can choose how well done your meat patty to be. 🍔
Salted egg crab pasta was really good! 👍 But I don\'t recommended eating both salted egg dishes on a single trip! Too heaty! 😂 Download the Poket app for a free dessert on your birthday! 😊
Pretty ok dish but no fantastic. Wouldnt order it again. The rice was a little mushy and fish tasted pretty normal.
On the contrary, the risotto uses italian short-grain rice and is slowly simmered in pork and tea broth topped with mushroom and salmon cubes to give its subtle fragrance. \n<br />Point to note: Arbite is one of the participating restaurants for entertainer app, so better utilize the one-for-one deal before this year ends! #省省省
Has a bit of everything i like all in one dish, it\'s nice to add the duck rillette and it\'s a bit spicy ( thanks to the jalapeño )! And great savings again thanks to the 1 - 1 with my @the_entertainer241 app!
We had the salted egg yolk crab pasta and the salmon risotto - both were delicious! The salted egg sauce had a rich curry-like flavor and the risotto a jap umami style to it. 
This fries was heaven!
Price: $14++ ... Overall, the food quite nice... The portion is also perfect!! 
Score: 6.5/10\n<br />Smelt really fragrant when it 1st arrived on my table but the salted egg taste isn\'t very apparent when I tasted it. This is the dry version of #saltedegg fries where the fries seemed to be coated with salted egg batter and then fried. The crumblies left behind tasted better, full of the fragrance of salted egg yolk &amp; garlic.\n<br />#rosSaltedEggEscapades #rosEats #sgyum #sgeats #sgfood #burpple
This pappardelle in truffled cream sauce smelled and tasted so heavily of CHEMICAL from the fake truffle oil that it left me queasy even hours after the meal. And I didn\'t even finish a quarter of it! 
I really appreciate handmade pasta but a pity this came out too thick and chewy. Otherwise, the chunky tomato sauce was very pleasing and the amount of seafood was rather generous too.
At only $8, I think these are not too bad at all!
The tagliatelle tasted like they may have taken one year’s worth of BodyCombat classes, but thankfully the tomato sauce, all wet and brothy, made the pasta easier and much more pleasant to down. The seafood performance was on point, with one exception – I accidentally bit on mussel shell pieces on multiple occasions, as the pieces camouflaged in the squid ink forest better than a camo creamed soldier under survival training. Hmmm. 3.5/5
Apparently similar to pesto but without pine nuts, the pistou made a pretty damn amazing condiment to the salmon! Love that they nailed the 🐠 from the crispy skin to the pinkish, slightly undercooked flesh. Yums 😍
One of the tallest burger I\'ve ever seen! Lettuce, tomato slices, portobello mushroom, fried egg, beef patty, cheese, onion rings, all stacked up into a delicious pyramid. $18. 
No hint of miso in the sauce but still tasty! Would have been nicer if there were real tempura prawns though. The batter on the prawns were slightly too thick and starchy for my liking. $18.
Crisp fries tossed in a dry mix of salted egg yolk and laksa leaves - need I say more? It\'s a little dry and not like those saucey salted egg yolk dishes, but I like it that way. Keeps the fries crispy. I could have this all day, err day. So damn awesome.
This Liu Sha French Toast (S$9++) caught my eye for the interesting combination of bitter matcha, buttery brioche, and sinful custard. So it was really disappointing that it tasted no where near as good as it sounds. I\'d much rather have a normal French Toast.
Tastes and smells exactly like the XO carrot cake you get at Hong Kong cafés. The duck must have been a hardcore Fitness First (Market Street branch) gym rat as his breast was sure tough. The non-gymmers were enjoyable - the mushrooms were nice and moist, whilst the sundried tomato was like a massive happy raisin. 3.7/5
Don\'t know about you, but this currently topped my list of fries &amp; truffle fries. The thick cuts of these babies and the distinct truffle oil taste on them.... another plate please!
Poached eggs with amazing tasting duck and bread($14). The salad also had a yummy dressing. They also had an interesting selection of tea. 
🎉🎉 (in advance) May your appetite never stop growing so we can always count on you 😙 HAHA just kidding don\'t kill me 😘 #burpple
A matcha soaked brioche french toast with a salted egg custard filling. Arbite serves 3 of them for only 9 bucks and it\'s not bad. It\'s pretty much like a liu sha bao but with a fluffier and more eggy bun. More salted egg custard please! Took forever to be served though. I waited a good 20 mins for this. 😒
I guess if you are looking for interesting fusion dessert, you can head to Arbite soon.
Name itself was intriguing, taste was too...
Arbite serving pretty decent desserts too at reasonable prices
One of dishes i enjoy at my visit there. Beef Rendang going exceptionally well with the pasta. However lacking the spicy kick that it should have as a rendang. But pretty decent!
Lamb shank was huge for its price and has little lamb foulness
This got to be the new crowd pleaser at Arbite. Different from sin lee food as this is like the dry version of salted egg York fries.
Salted egg fries and pan seared salmon, still my fav. TGIF! 🎉
Chef-owner Marc Wee has expanded his menu options where he did a western and local fare fusion. More details on the blog, jacqsowhat.com 🍴Here\'s salted egg fries for you? 🍟 TGIF! #shootkahliao
A concoction of orange juice, yoghurt, honey and milk!
Mocktail that we love of strawberry, sprite with lemonade? Refreshing and complementary to our meals
Cut up cakes with a assortment of jelly, fruits, nuts and raisins witg chempadak custard!
With a butter and yuzu hollandaise, sautéed vegetables and roasted potatoes. The sauce itself automatically made it to one of our mains choice. Who can withstand the attraction of hollandaise sauce. The snapper fillet was abit dry on the outside but surprisely tender on the inside! But roasted potatoes were slightly charred.
Roasted tamarind and chili marinated turkey breast, minced pork and bavon buah keluah stuffing with sautéed vegetables and roasted potatoes. Arbite Christmas Asian inspired menu - the turkey breast was tad dry for our liking but we loved the buah keluah which was interestingly good! Plus the sautéed vege
Came as starters, with the first mouth it tasted abit like char ta pumpkin soup. But after the second mouth, the soup starts to grow on you while i lick the bowl clean.

Unlike the usual french toast but it\'s Matcha soaked brioche. 😆 Among the rest were Horlicks Pannan Cotta and Piña Colada Creame Brûlée. \n<br />Arbite\'s refreshed menu offers one of the most affordable brunch &amp; desserts, w a wide spread of unique items. Get going yo 😅
I\'m not a fan of carbs all along. However, this was my favourite dish of the day. I totally enjoyed savouring the homemade crumpets. Do not be fooled by these monotonous and unassuming circles of cooked batter. They remained so soft and moist despite our endless photo-taking session. 😅😅. Coat the crumpets with the runny yolk and smear them with more butter. Be thick-skinned and ask for more butter. The more butter, the better!😁😁
I do have a weak spot for XO chilli sauce, more so if it is made in-house. 😍😍 This dish would be a hit if there can be more XO sauce and adequate seasoning.
The first item that caught the 4 ladies eyes is [LIU SHA FRENCH TOAST S$9 / comes in 3s] - matcha soaked brioche, salted egg custard, candied nuts &amp; fresh berries. Quite a special &amp; catchy item, eat it warm as it taste so much better.
Started off with Salted Egg Fries &amp; Beef Tataki 😋 Ending off the week w good food &amp; good company ☺️
So here\'s one of the highlights of tasting session @ Arbite Gardens last week!
Seared beef tataki is one of the most value-for-money dish @ Arbite Gardens. Accompanied with sautéed mushrooms &amp; drizzled with green onion oil and sesame sea salt flakes. You can easily get this paired with any of your sides or salad.
[Crumpets &amp; Bacon - $9] : I have always been wanting to limit myself with affordable brunch on the weekends but I failed each time. Till I saw Arbite\'s refreshed menu, it\'s a total change in view of quality and value for money. \n<br />They offers the cheapest all day breakfast that you can only get in Singapore, let\'s talk about gourmet food at a very affordable pricing, which is highly impossible for most cafes but Arbite make it possible for you without having any worries burning a hole in your pocket on the weekends.
Green Tea Tagliatelle with smoked duck breast is actually quite special and good even though we cant like taste, oh thats green tea tagliatelle probably it just contain a tiny winny bit of green tea! &amp; that it was just a little tad too oily.
😁😙 It was thick and fluffy and I love the sprinkles of walnuts and fruits! 🙆\n<br />#burpple
It\'s kinda dry tho it\'s flavorful, chicken leg is meaty and the fries goes well w the given sauce. I think it\'s a plus point that they plate it like that, looks much better and appetizing than just squeezing it at the side of a plate or having them on a saucer.
I kinda wished there were more other ingredients rather than little bits of tako, tomatoes and whatnot. Still a good try tho! And surprisingly the squid ink didn\'t stain my teeth
Wholesome goodness that satisfies all cravings for sausages and eggs. Good that arbite offers a smaller portion of brioche now, replaced by bigger portions of sides (: 
Mushroom Vol-au-vent from Arbite. The serving includes honjimeishi, button, shiitake, porcini mushrooms, cream, parmesan cheese and a side salad. #workhardlivewell
Crab Cake from Arbite. The serving consists of crab cakes, asparagus, fried eggs, hollandaise and tomato ginger chutney. Cost: S$17.90
The truffle flavor was well marinated with thick crispy fries. It was good other than that being too oily! 
Generous serving of apple chunks and the fluffiest pancakes I\'ve had. Will go back for seconds!
Had their only fish course for lunch. The salmon was well cooked, and the skin was seared perfectly. The salmon itself was a tad bland. The sauce is something like a pesto but it was really watery/oily. A sweet sauce, I think it was teriyaki, was drizzled on the fish, so the combination of flavors and textures was pretty good. Price was 25++, and I would put it on the slightly pricey side.
Steak house fries tossed with truffle sea salt and truffle oil.
Night-time cafe hopping at Serangoon Garden. Mushroom and Bacon Salad from Arbite.
For $13.90, I feel that it\'s really worth trying. The pancakes are so fluffy and light. The sweetness is just nice. 
Leong\'s belated birthday dinner yesterday at Arbite. Mainly is the Pork Burger, angmoh style mee pok and you mian. Hahaha. Okay, j think perhaps is my first and last time to Arbite. ;) #arbite #foodie #foodporn #igsg #cafe #cafesg
Awesome blend of papaya, mango, tuna tartare, grated cheese, salad &amp; lime sherbet ! It sounds unusual but it really comes together with an awesome burst of flavor ! A must try for the adventurous. :) 
the smoked salmon smorgasbord: smoked salmon x scrambled eggs x capers on a foccacia with salad
Salted caramel pancakes! Love the pancakes however find it very similar to mac\'s oh well ;)
Beef Onglet Tataki with Sautéed Mushrooms and a drizzle of Truffle Oil. The combination of pan seared beef slices and sautéed mushrooms is a delightful one, especially with the addition of a little truffle oil that adds an extra dimension of flavour to the dish. Definitely one of the dishes to order at Arbite!
Having tried various pastas from Arbite before, I have to admit that I was disappointed with this dish. While the texture and quality of the linguine was worthy of praise, the dish as a whole was a letdown. The salmon and the white wine cream sauce were rather bland and tasteless, paling in comparison to the linguine itself and the baby spinach. 
Amazing eggs benedict! Probably the best i\'ve tasted so far!
truffle fries!

smoked salmon croissant!
Flowy poached eggs with an added touch of savory ham.
Flaky and buttery croissant with runny omelette and the savory touch of the smoked salmon. Served with a garden salad by the side.

Arbite Breakfast! Need more salt for me though.. Haha.. Maybe it\'s just me. :)
Order it earlier in the day to have to freshly made! 
Still a favourite of mine there. Glad they kept it on the menu
TRUFFLE what more can I say
love it though the salted part was reeeeeaaaaally subtle. but yay who can resist banana AND pancakes?!
This starter is served with sautéed mushrooms and drizzled with truffle oil. The beef is marinated with shoyu and sesame oil. It didn\'t look fantastic, but to my surprise, it tasted fantastic. It was very tender and the combination of mushroom further enhanced the beef.
Counting down... the last 12th day. Celebrate with a Gula Melaka Tiramisu!
A really flavourful (and colourful) dish!

Starting the day with Early Bites from @Arbite_SG \n<br />1-for-1 with FEAST from @MECLUBSG \n<br />Smoked Salmon Pancakes (S$15)\n<br />Pulled Pork Wrap (S$15)\n<br />Washed down with \n<br />Hot Chocolate (S$5)\n<br />Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Milkshake (S$7) \n<br />Had a bit of incident when redeeming the deal. Guess the staff was unfamiliar with the mobile application. But then it\'s also my first time using it.

The Kaya Rice Pudding was distinctively local with Kaya and Gula Melaka flavours. However, the vanilla ice cream tasted really ordinary and kinda brought the dish down; coconut ice cream would have been better IMO. Similarly, the little almond bits didn\'t add enough crunch that was necessary.\n<br />We felt the same for the mains we had tonight. The pan seared seabass with coconut and lemongrass risotto lacked the desired crispy skin on the fish, and we couldn\'t taste the coconut and lemongrass. Tried their duck confit also and was also disappointed not to find the crispy skin on the duck. \n<br />Overall, felt that they might have tried too hard with the local fusion and missed the mark on the execution. #burpple #burpplesg  #foodgasm #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #exploresingapore #cakes #kaya

Garlicky mushrooms are my favourite!

Pan-seared salmon with creamy mash. If you think it looks very small portioned, you are wrong. With the mash, I think it\'ll fill up 3/4 of your stomach. 1/4 for the salted egg yolk fries as Appertizer, Oh my goodness. You will never feel so happy to taste those fries because it is seriously damn good. Located at the heart of Serangoon Gardens, easily spotted. Nice and cool ambience. (Chilly watermelon lemonade to finish up for your meal!) 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 
Gula Melaka tiramisu, XO crab para, salted egg yolk fries and beef tataki. It was all so good! The gula Melaka taste was strong and sweet. Beef tataki was slightly too raw for my liking. The salted egg yolk fries was just amazing and the xo crab pasta was my favourite!
Price: $4.50 ...
Can\'t wait to go back again for other stuffs on the menu^^
Score: 3/10\n<br />This was a complete disappointment. The salted egg taste was totally absent from the dish, except from the crumbled salted egg itself. The sauce was bland and had little body. Usage of Penne pasta was also a poor choice as well. Suffice to say, don\'t waste your calories on this one; my friend &amp; I didn\'t even finish our plates.\n<br />#rosSaltedEggEscapades #rosEats #sgeats #sgyum #sgfood #burpple
