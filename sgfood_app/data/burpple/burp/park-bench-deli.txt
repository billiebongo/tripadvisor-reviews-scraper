Tried it today and it was disappointing based on my personal honest opinion. Grilled cheese was fine but certain parts of the bread was so hard to even bite. Seriously for $15, I could get better food elsewhere.
Double fried egg, crispy bacon, mashed tater tots, tomatoes, melted cheddar, PBD sauce
The cubano (pull pork sandwich) though cost $16, but it is totally out of the world. U have to try it urself. \n<br />Since our yoga nearby, we are planning to try most of their sandwich. 👍🏻 4/5\n<br />📍179 Telok Ayer St, Singapore 068627 #yybffTelokAyer
This was on point except that it may be a little spicy for non Chilli eaters like me😂 also recommend their iced latte($6)!
My friend and I shared the Fried Chicken and Cheesy Beef Steak sandwiches (SGD16 each). The portions are big and I ate the chicken half first and left the beef one for teatime. The fried chicken patty was pretty good but as a whole sandwich it was bit dry. The combination of beef, cheese and onion was quite nice but pretty standard and not saucy enough for me. Service was good though and we managed to use the Burpple discount for a weekday lunch!
This ain\'t your regular sandwich joint. The Cubano  ($16) &amp; Katsu Chicken options here are definitely out-of-this-world and most certainly top the charts of things to order from this place. The Katsu\'s pretty huge so if you\'re not a big-eager, you might wanna consider sharing. Pair it along with their cold brew &amp; you\'re good to go! Ps-this picture doesn\'t do the food ANY justice at all.
This cheesy Meatballs got most of a classic meatball sub spot on: ciabatta (which tasted more like a chewy roll really) was yeasty, fragrant and soft; melted stringy mozzarella was 👌🏻; homemade Italian tomato sauce was flavourful and well-seasoned. Only thing that was slightly meh was, oddly, the meatballs. Though \"spiced\" meatballs sounded fabulous, it ended up being less of that pleasant kick at the end, but rather a more complex medley of flavours which, as commendable an effort it may be, sadly detracted from everything else. Meatballs were also a tad overcooked (perhaps too lean too) and lacked that lovely, moist, juicy bite that meatball dreams are made off.

So sinfully yummy, I couldn\'t stop after picking up my first one. Tater tots were crispy, beef chilli with sour cream and mayo is an all time winning combination. Recommended to share as it is a little more on the greasy side.
Chilling during lunch and trying all the cold brew that I can get my hands on. Nothing too special about this, I preferred Old Hen\'s one than this. I\'m not that good at telling what kind of coffee is good but this didn\'t leave anything especially memorable. Come here for their sandwiches instead because you won\'t regret it at all!
Get this together with the good o cheese steak sandwich and share. The batter was light and the chicken was really enjoyable. Generous servings as you would expect here at PBD!
I had flown in to Park Bench Deli for an errand but flew out grinning from ear to ear because I had their Crunchy Fried Chicken Sandwich in my clutch! 😄 The moment I got back into my waiting cab, off went the wrapping and in chomped my teeth.\n<br />The combo is pretty much a classic but you can trust PBD to do everything with panache. This means they use only thigh meat, sou vide-ing it first for tenderness before frying it to a loud crunchy finish (which somehow manages to not be oily). Swaddled with the chicken in the onion bread is a killer duo of cheekily spicy housemade slaw (it contains Peruvian green chilli sauce), cucumber and good ol\' Japanese kewpie mayo.\n<br />Is your mouth watering yet? Mine is 🤤
The fried chicken sandwich\'s made a comeback and it\'s better than ever! The batter is extra crunchy and stays that way longer and the new slaw spiked with green chilli just seals the deal. Suh guud!
The buttermilk #friedchicken one now features juicy fried chicken thigh, aji verde cabbage #slaw, and kewpie #Sriracha mayo, on soft onion #bread. I swear it feels like there\'s more meat than bread when you\'re eating it! #parkbenchdeli
Sunny side up in a buttery brioche bun with cheddar and this amazing thing called PBD sauce that will make you jittery with ecstasy (really can\'t imagine what exactly is in that amazing sauce). Also there was bacon even tho I told them to remove the bacon for me :/ and more veg would do this buttery rich sandwich some good. That lettuce was really minimal...
Hands down the best thing on the menu right now! They\'ve made a few changes, and I\'m happy to say it\'s a lottttt better now. I\'m not sure what they\'ve done, but despite the sriracha mayo in the sandwich, the chicken has a crazy crispy crust that makes this a party in the mouth. The sous vide chicken thigh is juicy as ever, and the jalapeño cabbage slaw is refreshing. Can\'t wait to devour this again.
I always love a good, simple mortadella sandwich, so I was glad to see this on their new menu! Generous slices of mortadella were stacked on crisp lettuce and juicy tomato in a nice onion loaf. It was nice, tasty and would be perfect on a warm day, but I sorely miss the truly satisfying Cured Meat sandwich this replaced! Unfortunately this just lacked the oomph and eye-closing moments that I naturally associate PBD sandwiches with.
I was surprised by this! Instead of chickpeas, this version uses chopped broccoli that is breaded and fried. It was moist and filling, and made very tasty with the creamy tzatziki. The huge falafel and sourdough rye made this very substantial for a meatless sandwich, so I can\'t imagine eating a whole one.
As if you need more choices at PBD. This new item on the menu is really great for sharing, especially if you\'re in a group of 4! I think any fewer people and you\'d have trouble enjoying the sandwiches you came here for. The chili con carne is super tasty, and is especially comforting on top of my childhood fav, tater tots! These crispy potato nuggets are just what you need after a loooong day.
Each bite is packed with an amalgamation of flavors and textures, which makes the calories of this Chicken Katsu sandwich worthwhile! A symphony in the mouth is what it is! 
My childhood fave made 100 times even more indulgent with chocolate-flavoured milk bread crusted in cornflakes and fried till golden-brown and impossibly crunchy on the exterior.
CHEESSSSEEEEEE 😍😍😍 Had classic American-styled sandwich grubs @parkbenchdeli , boy was it good!
It\'s a \'Vegetarian\'($15)\'s cheat meal la, fried eggs, grilled cheese, guac, pickled spicy Mexican-style slaw stuffed in a hoagie roll. EVERY non-believer that I recommended this became a fan. Tip: drizzle sirarcha for that spice on spice.
I know this may sound really weird, but this sandwich was juicy, wet and sloppy but an absolute delight to eat! The best part is simply receiving this piping hot and devouring it immediately upon arrival to your table. Didn\'t even have time to take a decent photo because I was so excited to eat this hahaha.
Think: mind blowingly delicious sandwiches. I do not kid. Every single flavour was spot on and absolutely delightful. I absolutely loved the Vegetarian Sub, which was nothing like your stereotypical vegetarian food which gets such a bad rep for being \'tasteless\'. This sub was dripping wet in sauce, slathered in cheese and guac, whilst encasing two well fried eggs and coleslaw which was nothing short of sublime. Wouldn\'t mind travelling to CBD again just for this. 
@parkbenchdeli\'s Porchetta ($16) is filled with loads of crispy pork belly, garlic aioli, arangula between toasty ciabatta. Finding the skin of the pork belly has got to be like a mini treasure hunt, with surprises every now &amp; then. \n<br />Top up another $10 for chips &amp; a can of Modern Times Fortunate Island, cause beer can be drunk all day errday. \n<br />Merry Christmas errbady 🎉🎅🏼
Homeboy now baby. 🍞\n<br />•\n<br />Porchetta (💵S$16) : Roasted Pork Belly, Roasted Garlic Aioli, Caramelised Onions, Arugula &amp; Ciabatta. 🐷\n<br />I\'m such a slut for Roasted Pork Belly &amp; PBD does it pretty well, along with the Roasted Garlic Aioli &amp; Caramelised Onions... just take my money already 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Part of the Festive Menu for the Christmas month, along with Hot Butter Ball (💵S$16) : sous vide Turkey, Rye Bread, Bread Stuffing, Cranberry &amp; Truffled Chicken Jus. Grab it before it\'s gone. 🖖🏻
To celebrate this festive season; the iconic, the splendid, the all-time favorite Park Bench Deli proudly brings to you two specially created sandwiches. Between the two, my heart and soul falls for the Porchetta ($16, right), a ciabatta sandwich that\'s stuffed with roasted pork belly (😱😱😱), caramelized onion, arugula and finished with a roasted garlic aioli. Such a magnificent combination and this feels all Christmasy already. For all of your sandwich fix, look no further than Park Bench Deli.\n<br />•\n<br />Park Bench Deli\n<br />Address: 179, Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068627 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #parkbenchdeli #porchetta
The hot butter ball was one and the other, in addition to a slightly revamped menu was the Porchetta sandwich ($16). Well seasoned pork belly that came with rocket, caramelized onions and roasted garlic aioli tucked into a dense ciabatta made a fragrant meal— rustic in the sense that it is a plate full of meat juices, sauce and bread. the kind that gets your hands dirty and in which every bite might differ from the last. The crispy skin is the crowning achievement, and you tend to portion it so you can have some with every bite.
Coffee after lunch to fight off that looming food coma~ ☕️☁️ balanced &amp; strong.
Pork belly was great -- tender and juicy meat w crispy skin. The sandwich wasn\'t very heavy with flavour from sauces and what not so I helped myself out with Sriracha for every mouth 🌝
🎄 the Hot Butter Ball ($16) was rye bread stuffed with turkey that had been tenderly sous vide, and it was evident in the amazing fluffy texture. It came topped with a sweet cranberry sauce and spiced bread stuffing for Christmas-y flavours. The Porchetta ($16) was a unanimous favourite between us, with roasted pork belly and a crisply fried skin that delivered a satisfying crunch, paired with caramelized onions and roasted garlic aioli sandwiched in ciabatta. So sinful, but oh so good 😲 #burpple #parkbenchdeli
A staff came up to me and said: I think you might know someone in the kitchen! I was surprised. So I looked in, I have so many eyes looking me!!! I was wondering which person do I know!!!!!! Until I saw this dude looking at me, a face that looks pretty familiar and almost couldn\'t recognise with the new hairstyle. Hahaha! So glad to see him doing well in this place. As a Chef, I\'m very proud of him! I always find familiar faces in different restaurants and cafes. Chef industry is so small!
[New Festive Menu] Mind blown. We love our SG sio bak, but the I discovered Park Bench can do really really good Italian sio bak too with this rendition of fennel marinated porcetta in warm soft ciabatta.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Melty and juicy pork belly contrasted sharply in texture by the crispy but crumbly cackling skin, well-creamed with roasted garlic aioli with hints of smokiness, flavoured with caramelized onions and balanced fresh arugula.. I wish every month is Christmas month because this is only available in December!
Bring on the festivities with Park Bench Deli’s festive menu.
When Burpplers get together, lunch is hardly a simple affair. Tastemaker Justin Teo and I kicked off our 3-part lunch at Park Bench Deli with their Porchetta, a festive special and let me just say this: IT BLEW US AWAY.\n<br />We couldn\'t care less for politeness as we mutually proclaimed our adoration for it through mouthfuls of the fantastic sandwich. Packed between the slices of ciabatta were crazy-good crunchy pork crackling, melt-in-the-mouth pork belly, roasted garlic aioli, caramelised onion and arugula. Altogether, they weren\'t a mere party in the mouth but a 3-day festival of hedonism!
Came back for this baby. I know it doesn\'t look the most amazing, but it\'s such a festive sandwich it makes me feel all warm n fuzzy inside. The turkey was even better this time - moist beyond belief, and the aroma of brown butter totally irresistible. The stuffing made the sandwich flavorful and moist without falling apart, and the cranberry just balanced everything. Gonna eat this as many times as I can before the year ends!
Usually, I avoid turkey but I would gobble-gobble this \"Hot Butter Ball\" in a heartbeat.\n<br />The dryness I associate with turkey meat is vanquished via sous vide preparation. Also, the shredded turkey is mixed evenly with stuffing, brown butter emulsion and truffled chicken jus which makes the main filling incredibly moist and flavourful in a \"hugs-you-from-the-inside\" way. With the right proportion of cranberry jam smeared on, this forms a seriously glorious sandwich that\'s perfect for the festive season.\n<br />I recommend getting your hands on it before the year is out.
Imagine an unbelievable moist sous vide turkey, bathed in a brown butter emulsion, truffled chicken jus, and bread stuffing that just makes the whole thing moan-worthy. The cranberry jam is just sweet and acidic enough. It\'s a messy sandwich, and about as perfect as a turkey sandwich can get. Pictured is a half portion, from a media preview of their festive menu. Check it out from tomorrow (24th nov) till the end of the year!
Jamon, pimento cheese, cheddar cheese, kewpie on buttered bread. Smells amazing... tastes even more amazing! Need to get myself more of this soon. #burpple #parkbenchdeli
Lunch bites of Seared Pulled Pork, Smoked Ham, Cheese, with pickles and yellow mustard.
The cheese steak sandwich is actually molten cheese sauce with beef brisket. I had the thought that beef brisket would be softer, but it turned out to be very chewy and difficult to swallow. It is pretty messy too.
First try at peanut butter jelly and decided that im not a fan of PBJ. It is a little too dry for my liking.

Back @parkbenchdeli, fast becoming my favourite spot to get my sandwich craving fix if not it already is my go to place. 🍞\n<br />.\n<br />This is the Cubano (💵S$16) Seared Pulled Pork, Smoked Ham, Bread \'N\' Butter Pickles, Cheese, Yellow Mustard &amp; Cubano Bread. 😋🐷\n<br />If you watched the movie \'Chef\' &amp; always wanted to try a Cuban Pull Pork Sandwich... This is a good choice. The Pulled Pork is a tad Dry for me but that aside, it\'s a Personal Mission of mine to try all their 11 Sandwiches. 😳\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: They offer 11 Sandwiches therefore it\'s quite a pain in the ass to just choose one. (All is Good, that\'s what my Friends said anyway) Go for their Cheese Steak &amp; PB&amp;J, you\'ll never go wrong. 🖖🏻
Ahhhh @parkbenchdeli, how I\'ve miss your Sandwiches... &amp; see you tomorrow. 5 out of 11 sandwiches conquered from the Menu. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />Patty Melt (💵S$17) Beef Chuck Patty (150g), Caramelised Onions, American Cheese, Bread \'N\' Butter Pickles, Rye Bread &amp; PBD sauce. 😋\n<br />It was not bad, can\'t go wrong with the classic combination of Cheese, Caramelised Onions &amp; Beef. The pickles though was a tad too acidic for me. 🍞🐮\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Most if not all PBD\'s sandwiches are kinda Heavy, Flavourful &amp; Satisfying regardless of choice. Looking forward to try the rest &amp; see which will be my favourites. 😋 Just like a kid in a Candy Store.
Warning: Huge sandwiches alert. (And long post alert) Overbought because these three dishes can actually feed at least 3-4 people 😱 The 2 of us had to take away the rest to eat it for dinner! 
If you think PB&amp;J is already an Ultimate Classic combination (which it is)... I\'m Sorry yet Happy to say that Park Bench Deli has brought it to another level, a Whole New Level my friends... 😋\n<br />.\n<br />Allow me to introduce you their Signature PB&amp;J (💵S$8). This is worth the Calories, This is the Pinnacle of PB&amp;J, This is so Wrong but yet so Good, it\'s Sinful but ask for your Forgiveness later, let me tell you why.🖖🏻\n<br />Crunchy Peanut Butter with Mixed Berry Jam slathered between a Chocolate &amp; Milk Bread that is Crusted with Crunchy Cornflakes. 😳\n<br />Now you know why. .\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Honestly speaking it\'s quite heavy (Jelak) so it\'s Best to share it with a person or 2.

Behold... This is the Cheese Steak (💵S$16) from what I believe to be currently one of the Best Sandwich Shop in Town, Park Bench Deli. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />Sliced Beef Brisket \"which is sliced many many\" (according to the Menu), Sautéed Onions, Molten Cheese Sauce all in the Hoagie Roll (which are hollowed out for more fillings). 🐮\n<br />Basically a Philly CheeseSteak, the thinly sliced Beef was really Generous I mean like \'Wow\'?! It was Juicy too, so Juicy that frankly, you\'ll end up getting your hands dirty but Trust me it\'s damn well worth it (&amp; a ton of tissues which luckily it\'s provided) 👍🏻\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Get 1 of any Savoury Sandwiches (but I\'d Recommend the CheeseSteak Obviously) &amp; their Signature PB&amp;J as Dessert, Sandwiches are cut into half therefore it will be wise to come with a Partner to share. 🖖🏻
Tucked along shop houses at Telok Ayer (5-10 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar or Telok Ayer MRT station), PBJ was a pleasant change to the concrete jungle w open kitchen, long communal table and groovy music. Ordered the Cured Meat Sandwich ($16); layers of salami, coppa, rosette, pancetta and fresh frisee, w mozzarella and tomato aioli spread on each side of the softest, toasted brioche bun. You get all the flavors and richness of cured meat in one single bite. This is one helluva sammich! 
Still thinking about yesterday’s one-day only special menu featuring Japanese-inspired sandwiches as @ParkBenchDeli and @TeppeiSyokudo joined forces!
Glad I made it for @ParkBenchDeli\'s one-day pop up event in collaboration with @TeppeiSyokudo for the launch of Hitachino Nest Beer\'s custom brew Yuzu Golden Ale, which I sadly did not try. Not so much a fan of the whole chirashi atop toasted bread but I can vouch for how fresh it was. What took us by surprise was the unagi tempura sandwiched between two soft brioche buns! I get a little apprehensive towards tempura-ed fish but the batter was light without masking all that goodness from the unagi. I THINK this deserves a place on the menu.
$17 | crispy dark rye, american cheese, thick slab of 150g beef patty. BURP.
Truly lived up to what I\'ve heard of PBD\'s grilled cheese sandwich. A fantastic mix of cheese, gloriously kiap-ed between two slices of soft rye bread (I think), then toasted till it turns into this beautiful mess. My only wee peeve is that it ain\'t crisp and crusty on the outside: the perfect grilled cheese, pour moi, has a lovely charred and crisp exterior — even slightly burnt — and gooey insides. But that\'s just me; that aside this is fantastic. 
No lunch at PBD is complete without their insane PB&amp;J. Crunchy peanut butter and mixed berry jam, liberally slathered between slices of chocolate and milk bread, then crusted with crunchy cornflakes and fried till you get this gooey goodness. It\'s calorie-packed artery-clogging and diabetes-inducing, but damn it is irresistible. #Burpproved
I have no idea what RBC is supposed to stand for, but that didn\'t dampen my enjoyment of this tasty turkey sandwich. If you always feel guilty about ripping into one of PBD\'s phenomenal Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, this is a healthier and much less guilt inducing option.
As if sinfully sensational sandwiches weren\'t enough to pack the house, Park Bench Deli also offers up 4 beers on tap, which greatly delights the alcoholic in me. One of the new beers on tap is this Panhead XPA (Xtra Pale Ale) which is a great summer beer.
Endless folds of cured meat that reminded me of pancetta panini in Italy. Look at that brioche!! 
You can get a 1-for-1 meal deal from the participating Western food eateries in your office or home vicinity.\n<br />:\n<br />CBD folks, we are so lucky to have a sammich powerhouse in our list of participating restaurants. The guys at Park Bench Deli (who just turned 1, congrats!) know meats so well, they create astounding flavours that exceed expectations from a simple-looking sandwich. You peel off the wrapping, see the halves and think “oh wow that is one meaty sandwich” or “that’s a lot, I think I can save some for later”. Then you take the first bite… It’s a game-changer. Nope, no more saving, I am eating ALL of that RIGHT NOW.\n<br />:\n<br />Look how thick the thigh portion is - this chicken did not skip leg day. I made a slight error in judgment ordering this item for delivery because it wasn’t as crispy as it should be with the fried breadcrumb coating that came slightly soggy. Honestly, my bad. But the succulent meat and the addictive creamy kewpie (japanese mayo) was enough to send me on a foodie high. My colleague also couldn’t stop nodding and mouthing “so good” between bites of her cheese steak sandwich.\n<br />:\n<br />I can’t wax lyrical enough about how good PBD\'s sandwiches are, just don’t miss this opportunity to share the love with your friends and grab the Deliveroo deal next week!\n<br />#BurppleROO #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #Burpproved
Patty Melt: PBD sauce, sliced beef chunks, melted American cheese, bread n butter pickles on crispy, toasted rye bread that crackles with every mouthful. \n<br />This is burger in a sandwich form, only much more flavourful and with that crisp of toasted bread. ($17) Love that they cut the sandwich along with the paper into half for easy eating, so when you split it open across the middle, you see wonderfully melted cheese pulling on both ends across the sandwich 😍
My second Deliveroo Experience was nearer to workplace and one that I have tried previously and totally went crazy over the bold flavours, Park Bench Deli.
Deliveroo-ed Cheese Steak on a rainy day with the best kind of mess!!!! Massively filled with pretty tender beef briskets of good mouthfeel, finger-lickin\', delish sauce, all with melted cheese that can\'t be seen but yknow it\'s there holding it all together and what made the sandwich even better were the caramelised onions that for once, I didn\'t mind. 
This puts! other! sandwiches! to! shame!! Because of Deliveroo\'s #BYDTB Western Food 1-for-1 week, I got this together with 2 other Cured Meat sandwiches for $13 (with my Deliveroo credits... thats $38 off wow). Pity this is not included in the 1-for-1 deal, but I still can\'t wait to try alllll of the sandwiches in the menu. PBD is really one of the best cafes around. 
this tuas man actually foolishly attempted to find parking here at 12.30. rounds later he found and had the last laugh. in a parallel universe where comic exaggeration is possible, i will be throwing these sliced beef brisket in molten cheese sauce in the air like confettis, twerk with the hoagie roll, hi five with the folks here and roaring in laughter mouth wide open full of half bitten beef. that good.
The answer to any bad day. Thank you, sandwich, for being so consistently ridiculously cheesy, and thank you, soup, for always being deeply roasty and hearty. Dunk boldly, friends!  
Creamy dollops of peanut butter and jam slathered on slices of softened milk and chocolate bread, with cornflakes coated on the surface for that crunch. TAKE MY MONEY. Also tried The Cubano, not bad but wasn\'t particularly outstanding. Bread was fragrant but a tad too hard, pulled pork was flavourful but not very tender and juicy. It could have been a little overcooked. Grilled cheese was nice, however I feel that it would be more delicious if the cheese was melted, such that it drains all over the pork. Overall, it was a delicious meal, and a great way to end a tiring work week. Will I come again? YES.
$15| I love the fried egg, dat grilled cheese and just how that whole combination works! 
The amount of meat is thicker than the bread! Very juicy and delicious. \n<br />Top: Pork Canitas with fried egg and sour cream\n<br />Left: Philly cheese steak ($16). Super saucy and juicy. \n<br />Right: Chicken Katsu. Better than any Zinger or McSpicy! \n<br />#burpple
This is priced at $16 but I only paid $6 thanks to Deliveroo~ Second time trying PBD, this one was very satisfying! Not as shiok as the cheesesteak, but still pretty darn good. Just needs a bit more wetness to it!
One of the better and more addictive sandwiches I\'ve had. Big, chunky, tender and melt in your mouth pork belly sandwiched between pickled carrots, crushed peanuts and doused in Hoi sin aioli in crispy soft bahn mi. 
I was initially torn between ordering up the Patty Melt and the illustrious cheesesteak sandwich. After much deliberation, I ordered the cheesesteak...and I regret nothing.
Let us observe a minute of silence for Saturday, who was gone far too soon, with a pint of Dead Guy Amber Ale. This Dead Guy is guaranteed to resurrect you, with its strong malty taste and its hoppiness. There\'s a note of yeast and caramel swirling around in the alluring amber beverage, and has some fruity flavors that ambush you towards the end. It\'s also light bodied and low in carbonation, and all these characteristics make this beer a refreshing companion to any of Park Bench\'s decadent sandwiches.
Located just in the middle of Meat Smith and the famous Ocean Curry Fish Head! A hippy cheerful blue deli! Ordered Patty Melt ($17) without pickles to go, and I was needed to leave down my name. The wait was rather quick despite peak lunch hour! 
Favouritest sandwich joint has turned one! 🎂
This is so good! Totally tasted like stir fry beef bulgogi! Marinated so well. ($16) They only served cold brew here, so rmb to get your coffee fix somewhere else! 
So dope! To all cheese lovers, it\'s a good try! ($14)
I was expecting slices of meat topped with melted cheese. Instead, when I cracked open the paper-wrapped roll, an orgiastic party was revealed. Try as I might, there was no differentiating the components of beef brisket, molten cheddar and cooked-on-the-grill-till-soft onions. It was just one big, saucy and terribly delicious mess! 
Amazing selection of sandwiches! Got myself the cheese steak and topped it up Sirarcha. Beautiful! Cold brew was good too! Will be back to try the kongbabao! #parkbenchdeli #burpple #hungrygowhere
It\'s hard to resist anything Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly, especially after being tempted by my fellow CBD foodie khakis that Park Bench Deli makes a mean PB&amp;J sandwich. Crunchy peanut butter and mixed berries jam burst out as you sink your teeth into chocolate &amp; milk bread crusted with cornflakes. Much as I love to finish it on own, it\'s quite impossible...
Cheesy goodness with greasy crispy bread, served with a cup of tomato soup which were more like tomato paste but actually tasted really good WITH the sandwich, downplaying its richness. $14 well spent for some artery clogging happiness. 
Sinfully rich PBJ sandwich - peanut butter and mixed berry jam, cornflake-crusted chocolate &amp; milk bread! This seems like something that you can easily whip up at home but somehow pbd made it so shiok that I don\'t feel too bad spending $8 on it + it made my busy Tuesday a little better🤗 But...... a running sesh is due.
Deliveroo to the rescue when it\'s raining outside. Very tasty, and I liked that it was a fried chicken thigh. Unfortunately it was a bit soggy when it arrived - as expected - but the small bits that were still crunchy were delightful. Solid bread, as always.
SHOUTOUT TO ALL YOU CHEESE LOVERS. This is the place to be to get a damn good Grilled Cheese Sandwich, plus a warm cup of tomato soup. A bite into this guarantees you a seat on the cheese express right to the beautiful cheese haven. Just look at that rich melty gooey goodness! I love the additional crunchy bits on the bread outside, great texture and definitely your cure to any bad day. Best to have this shared or risk fainting from a cheese overload! 
Guess we might have over-ordered a little as not only did we got The Cubano and Cheese Steak, we couldn\'t resist adding the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Sandwich ($8) into the mix.
Do note it\'s a mess to have- expect a mix of cheese and beef sauce all over, but it\'s sure worth every grime you have to wash off.
First order of business with my new lunch kakis after Burpple\'s CBD Lunch Ideas guide 🙌🏻 Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly —  a cornflake crusted chocolate and milk bread sandwiching heaps of mixed berry jam and crunchy peanut butter. This definitely brought out the child and sweet tooth in us! Highly recommended to share because you should also try their Cheese Steak ($16)!
First order of business with my new lunch kakis after Burpple\'s CBD Lunch Ideas guide yesterday 🙌🏻
There are sandwiches, and then there are Park Bench Deli\'s sandwiches — generously filled, cleverly put together and packed with punchy flavours. The menu of Lunch Sandwiches (from $15) is concise — whatever you choose is going to be good. Get the Cheese Steak ($16) if you like your lunch very beefy and cheesy. Bring a colleague to share it with, just so you can get the cornflakes-crusted PB &amp; J ($8), a version of the classic peanut butter and jelly combo done very, very right.
It\'s crispy, it\'s crunchy, it melts in your mouth, it\'s sweet, it\'s savoury, and the list goes on. 
This artery-clogging, tummy fat-inducing, cornflake crusted sandwich should be crowned the King of all PB &amp; Js as I just love the fun yet complex textures. Hearty but definitely not healthy, the nothing-can-go-wrong combination of creamy peanut butter and sweet jam cuddled between slices of fried chocolate bread can unfortunately get a little cloy so sharing is caring!
As with their sandwiches, this is one kickass rice bowl with all the right boxes checked - luxurious, melt in your mouth pork belly with just enough acid and crunch from the pickled cabbage to balance everything out. And everything is better with crispy pork crackling and a ramen egg so there you go! \n<br />Download @holler.out and quote ‘jonathanwong’ to get 10% off your meal when you spend $30 (or more).

I love crispy pork skin and lard - this is quite another level... How did they make the lard blow up into a bubbly keropok-sized crackling?! This, and the braised pork chunks with m&amp;m-slogan fatty layers, is why veganism will never be a concept my body can accept. 
Peanut butter jelly, chocolate, cornflake crusted sandwich. This just blew my mind! I cannot even....... 
Crazy sinful, oozing with peanut butter. Crispy, gooey all-in-one. This is mad love. Will be back to try the rest of their sandwiches! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 For 10% off your bill, download the @holler.out app and use my code \"XUANNYKELLY\" (min. $30 spending). Enjoy!!! 😋 #hollerout
drowning in schoolwork isn\'t that bad with my pb&amp;j (peanut butter and jelly, chocolate, cornflake crusted sandwich) from @parkbenchdeli in hand. \n<br />now if only @deliveroo_sg could offer me and my schoolmates some credits, tiding through our hell weeks would be so much easier 😔
Here\'s one of those places I\'d love to revisit on a weekly basis should my schedule (and the currently expanding waistline) allow. | @parkbenchdeli \n<br />Every time I think they\'ve recreated the best sandwich, it always tastes better on my next visit. Every, single, darned, time. Yeap, I\'m also talking about that signature thick double layer of creamy peanut buttery spread lovingly smooched between both chocolate and milk loaves, armoured with crushed cornflakes.. then the sweet jam creeps in and smacks that ball way outta the park. So looking forward to my next visit 😁
Meat and cheese lovers rejoice. This is the holy matrimony of steak and cheese stuffed between a bun. \n<br />As said in the menu description, the steak well marinated, juicy and is many many. The cheese is a cheesy mess and a lot a lot. It might be a little too much cheese for one, so bring a friend to share and try more stuff. \n<br />Well worth the crowd and heat to get your hands on this. \n<br />Monster loves sticky chewy cheesy steak sandwiches!
We had the PB&amp;J ($8) and the Cheesesteak sandwich ($16). They use 3 slices of bread for the PB&amp;J, two slices of chocolate bread and one white slice of white bread in the middle. It was also cornflake-crusted which gave the sandwich a nice crunch. I liked it, but the peanut butter they use sure dries out your mouth. Would have liked more jelly too. As for the cheesesteak, just look at that meat-to-bread ratio! Very satisfying. Already thinking of going back to try their other sarnies! 
The flavors were really rich! Loved the mozzarella in this Cured Meat sandwich ($16)! The staff were really friendly too, music was great (Britney Spears was blasting 😂) all round great experience. 
I love love love the acai bowl here cos it\'s like homemade &amp; it doesn\'t have chunks of sugar-loaded granola (they use rolled oats instead)... Although the variety of fruit toppings is \'seasonal\', I like how guilt-free I feel after indulging in it. As for the grub, I miss the old \'Vegetarian\' where sharp cheddar is grilled onto the bread &amp; oozy egg &amp; avocado &amp; some addictive spice. The new rendition is good but nah not for me😔
They weren\'t kidding when they said molten cheese and many many slices of beef. This was stuffed chock full of thin beef slices that had been tossed in rich cheese sauce. Very messy to eat but very satisfying. And as it turns out, there\'s such a thing as too much meat - and that\'s cos the bread was too good!
Brioche, salami, coppa, rosette, pancetta, sundried tomato aioli and fresh mozzarella. At $16 this is definitely not just any other sandwich. The slightly sweet brioche was wonderful, and contrasted well with the savory components of the sandwich. The cured meats were of excellent quality as well, and portions were generous. Tearing open the waxed paper to reveal the two neat halves of the sandwich was an experience in itself, actually. 
This PB&amp;J (choc, PB, jam, cornflakes crusted bread) is a whole new level of indulgence. Must to try, but sharing would be better.
The Lox does just that with some cold pressed orange juice from @gorillapressco. What you need to check out, are the new cookies from @parkbenchdeli - I had the chocolate caramel and the oatmeal cranberry and they are the best soft cookies I have had in a while. Need to get myself more of those... #burpple #parkbenchdeli
PB&amp;J: three slices of bread, crusted with crushed cornflakes, liberally slathered with chocolate spread, peanut butter and strawberry jam. It\'s achingly sweet no doubt about that, but it\'s also so damn delicious! Best shared among friends though, cause it can get a tad jelak if eating alone.
You\'re gawking at one half of a 6-inch philly, essentially a bulging mob of beef smothered in molten cheese and caramelised onions. The soft, crusty hoagie roll is hollowed out to make room for sliced beef MANY MANY. Yumz.

The Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($14) from @parkbenchdeli is all warm, gooey, stretchy cheddar and emmental cheese on bread. \n<br />All you need to do now is to forget everything and take a big bite into this and all is well. If you didn\'t float to seventh heaven with that, take a second bite after dipping into the roasted tomato soup and that will seal the deal for you.
While its known as a good lunch spot, it is the pure decadence of the dinner menu that makes it perfect for a \"Treat Yourself\" night. Gather three friends, and expect to get your hands greasy. Be wise and order four things to share. The two must-trys are the heart-stoppingly delicious Patty Melt on Rye ($16), and the delightful Cured Meat Sandwich ($16) — cool, creamy mozzarella atop a stack of assorted cured meats between brioche buns. Dunk the sinfully oozy Grilled Cheese ($14) into the roasted tomato dip and into your mouth — cue inappropriate noises. Finish off with the PB&amp;J ($8) that is crusted in cornflakes then fried. Wash this all down with an ice-cold pint — you\'ll need it.
$8 Homemade goodness.. generous portion of fruits, shredded coconut &amp; raw cocoa nibs on point. 
Out of the three sandwiches we tried, their Fried Chicken was the unanimous favourite. Think a moist, flavourful, and juicy slab of buttermilk fried chicken, topped with a corn &amp; cabbage slaw and some Russian dressing. The whole boneless chicken thighs were first marinated with herbs and sous vide, then marinated overnight and deep-fried to order. All that tedious preparation results in an epic crunchy exterior (despite the sauces) which breaks apart into the most tender and succulent chicken. Dee-lee-shers. No seriously, you HAVE to try it to understand.
A smashed, charred beef patty, sandwiched by PBD sauce, American cheese, caramelized onions and perfectly crisp rye bread. Gosh this was good. And a little insanely indulgent. SHARE pls, and wash down with lager on tap.
This should be illegal, or reserved just for cheat days. Heck, this would be the cure for any bad day. Just look at that grilled cheese insanity, but what really took it over the edge was that warm, deep-roasted tomato dip that just begs for you to dunk the sandwich in. Again; SHARE. And you\'ll be darned pleased. 
Now you can get all of that - salami, coppa, rosette, fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomato aioli - sandwiched between the softest brioche at @parkbenchdeli during dinner time. To manage expectations - don\'t expect your friend to share this with you if he/she orders it. #justsaying
You catch up on your Instagram feed and you see this thick, gooey cheddar and Emmenthal grilled cheese sandwich that your friend had at @parkbenchdeli with a thick and rich roasted tomato dip. You can then picture biting into the the crusty toasted bread and having all that goodness slide down to your stomach. And now you are hungry again. \n<br />#parkbenchdeli #burpple
My first encounter with this delightful piece of heaven was at Savour, then after many months of reliving that memory, I finally found it again at the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. NOW IT\'S ON THE MENU AND YOU CAN ORDER IT ANY TIME OF THE DAY! If you still do not get what I am saying, here is a simple summary - GO EAT IT NOW. \n<br />PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT\n<br />To all lovers of epic sandwiches - @parkbenchdeli is now open for weekday dinners till 2200h. \n<br />#parkbenchdeli #burpple
A dream come true for beef lovers, the Cheese Steak sandwich from Park Bench Deli is just so satisfying and shiok! Prepare to get your hands dirty when you bite into the many many slices of beef topped with sauteed onions and molten cheese sauce that oozes out with every mouthful. The thinly sliced beef were juicy and tender but made even better covered in the rich and sinful cheese sauce! A combination of flavours that never go wrong, it was definitely the best beef sandwich I have ever had.
Featuring the awesome southern-style Fried Chicken Sandwich from Park Bench Deli! Hollowed out, the buns are able to accommodate and pack the ingredient - the crispy and juicy boneless chicken thighs, corn as well as cabbage slaw with Russian dressing. With the slight aroma of buttermilk from the fried chicken, the hearty six-inch sandwich was really good~
The Fried Chicken Sandwich, featuring Whole boneless chicken thighs marinated with lemon zest, garlic and rosemary, then cooked sous-vide for several hours to retain a moist bite. 
Impromptu decisions truly make my day. \n<br />That\'s tender moist slices of turkey, crisp bacon, alfalfa sprouts (gotta have your greens), meaty tomatoes and cheese ranch, all cramped between a crusty loaf.\n<br />Thanks for the treat guys! 🙌🏻 @maehng @dreisoen @drbodega
Earlier today, we managed to squeeze ourselves into Park Bench Deli, again. Impromptu decisions truly make my day. \n<br />That\'s tender moist slices of turkey, crisp bacon, alfalfa sprouts (gotta have your greens), meaty tomatoes and cheese ranch, all cramped between a crusty loaf. #sandwich #pbd #handsinframe\n<br />15bucks/Turkey RBC sandwich
Super yummy - I missed philly so much. Awesome sandwiches available here. Check them out.
Probably the coolest sandwich shop in town now.
The chicken portions in the Fried Chicken sandwich were crispy/not oily (great job coating and frying) and thick though a wee bit dry, but the Russian dressing and the slaw made up for the \"moisture\". Small cozy place with few seats for stalkers, er I mean curious customers to people-watch while enjoying their meal.
4 more to go. I could really use a fried chicken sandwich from @parkbenchdeli right now. That juicy succulent southern fried chicken thigh with the super tasty corn and cabbage slaw with Russian dressing that I cannot get enough of. It\'s days like this that you need these magical things for sustenance. \n<br />#burpple #ParkBenchDeli
GAWD, the sandwiches at #ParkBenchDeli were good.
There are very few seats and the air conditioning wasn\'t great but the stellar company and delicious sandwiches more than made up for it! #sgfoodies #sgfood #burpple
There is finally a place in Singapore that can do a good cochinita pibil. You have my love for long time just for that.
This pretty neat place makes really good sandwich that made my day a little better after coming back from a 2-week holiday😍
After teasing taste buds in several pop up events, Park Bench Deli has finally set up shop at Telok Ayer dishing out American-style sandwiches with a very favourable filling-to-bread ratio. For beef lovers, go for their Cheese Steak Sandwich ($16) – the hoagie rolls are hollowed out and stuffed with a ridiculous amount of rib-eye slivers and caramelised onions oozing with cheddar cheese sauce. Also noteworthy are the Kong Bak Banh Mi ($14 with melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly) and the indulgent Fried Chicken Sandwich with a most juicy chicken piece cooked sous vide before marinating in buttermilk overnight! For a balanced meal, end it off with the superb Acai Bowl or grab a pack of their incredible hummus to dip some crudités in.
I think the reason why I\'ve never found a satisfactory sandwich around (apart from the fact that perhaps I haven\'t looked hard enough) is cause I believe the first thing any respectable sandwich should have is crusty toasted shell of bread and these guys from PBD, they definitely nailed it. 🙌🏻\n<br />#FTrecommends
| Probably the best sandwich I\'ve had. Not kidding. #Burpple #ParkBenchDeli
The seasoned chefs of Park Bench Deli have finally settled down. Launched this Monday on Telok Ayer Street (next to Meatsmith), Chef Ming rocks the kitchen with what he does best. The menu is kept short and sweet, with five sandwiches, five sides (if you\'re a small eater) and a couple of craft beer options.
This made for such a delightful breakfast. Soft, fluffy buns sandwiching a fried egg, bacon, frisee and PSD sauce. One of those things that is so simple yet so good. Was gonna go for the acai bowl but let\'s face it, this is a winning combination. And some days you just gotta treat yoself. (Which i kinda do everyday so that has lost all meaning.) 
No other sandwich has had me looking this excited. You guys are pure heart and soul. @maehng @dreisoen @drbodega \n<br />Only at @parkbenchdeli. 📷: @yewjh
Only 2 items, Fried Egg Sandwich and Acai Bowl, are available in the morning, with the remaining sandwiches served after 11am.
Coming with Turkey Breast and Turkey Bacon, this sandwich was somehow less outstanding than the other two probably due to the combination of its condiments. Thought that there were too much sprouts, and the sandwich seemed to be pretty much overwhelmed by the generous amount of Cream Cheese Ranch that it seemed to be fighting with the turkey to be the star of the sandwich.
This brings my love for Fried Chicken to another scale. Coming with Southern Fried Chicken, Corn &amp; Cabbage slaw and Russian Dressing, the main star has to be the Southern Fried Chicken; tender and crisp and perfumed with buttermilk flavour, it was the ultimate comfort food that I would not mind having to pamper myself when needed.
Think of the Philly Cheese Steak for this one; a really generous amount of of beef fillet (stated on the menu as \"sliced beef many many\"), and comes with sautéed onions and molten cheese sauce. Very satisfying, for its a classic combination that never goes wrong when it comes to gooey cheese, juicy onions and tender and easy-to-bite beef slices. If you are wondering, this is just half of the size of the usual, so you know what to expect for the full portion.
I have probably got a thing with burgers or sandwiches with bacon and fried eggs, but I really love how this sandwich was going. Looking more like a burger with round buns, the buns were surprisingly pillowy and soft, while the fried egg was sunshine goodness with the savoury strips of bacon and coated in their signature PBD sauce which is tangy and sweet. A great way to start the day with!
Perfect for a quick power brekkie, this \'smoothie\' is made my blitzing acai berry purée with bananas, strawberries and lime juice. It comes topped with more berries, crunchy granola (love the toasted, crunchy element it adds!) and coconut flakes. If this is too healthy for you, they\'ve got breakfast sarnies too – think scrambled eggs, bacon and avocado! 
Say hello to a layer of melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly (simmered for 24 hours!) with crunchy pickled daikon and carrots, spicy roasted peanuts, coriander and hoisin aioli. Comfort food at its best!
The pulled pork is made by marinating pork shoulder in achiote seed, orange and lime juice before it\'s wrapped in banana leaf. After a long \'low and slow\' braise, the pork is shredded and is piled with guacamole, fresh salsa, pickled onion, Cotija cheese andddd pork cracklings (why am I not surprised). 😂 Literally a fiesta in the mouth! 
I was a little sad when they ran out of this at the Lepak at the National Museum event, but hey, it\'s here now! 🎉🎉 A (whole) boneless chicken thigh is seasoned with lemon zest, garlic and rosemary before it is cooked in a sous vide machine for a couple of hours. It is then marinated in buttermilk overnight and then dredged in flour and more spices before it\'s deep fried for a crunchy finish. 
The hoagie rolls are hollowed out so they can stuff it with more slivers of rib-eye and caramelised onions. Just look at that oozing cheddar cheese sauce! 😱😱 \n
Photo does not do justice to the real thing. They don\'t skimp on the meat, it\'s definitely worth your money 😋
Probably my new favourite sandwich at park bench deli this is the bomb!
#AATeats #peanutbutterjelly #sandwich #burpple
For a sandwich I honestly think twice because of the price. But it is really good 🤤 the pulled pork really stretches across my teeth and the cheese melts in my mouth. It’s really filling as well!!!! The sticker is really cute too haha! Do recommend if you have extra cash for some really good sandwich HAHA! #burrplesg #burrple #foodiesg #instafoodsg #foodsg #foodblogsg #parkbenchdeli #foodgramsg #amoystreet
And that’s exactly what transpired during this Peranakan takeover. The collaboration between @parkbenchdeli x @candlenutsg proudly brings to you a one-day only popup with a unique creation of the traditional Nasi Campur ($25) prepared with a modern twist. Comes loaded with nasi kunyit, beef rendang, fried salted vegetable duck ball, wing bean sayur lodeh, buah keluak bergedil, sunny side-up egg and homemade sambal, it is a chock full of ingredients in a single pack of food. What hit the home run was the rich flavours from the lemak and the right balance of savouriness and spiciness.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Park Bench Deli\n<br />Address: 179, Telok Ayer Road, Singapore 068627\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #parkbenchdeli #candlenut #candlenutsg
A great mix of textures and flavors from ultra tender beef in the rendang, to the slightly crunchy wing beans, to the earthy bergedil bursting with the flavors of buah keluak and my personal favorite, the fried salted vegetable and duck ball. What a pre-weekend treat! \n<br />And people from @nativebarsg, you must, must bring the Forager’s Garden to your bar. The curry leaf gin, calamansi tonic were a match made in heaven. I could drink this forever. \n<br />#nativebarsg #burpple #candlenutsg #parkbenchdeli #pbdxcandlenut
I guess what’s still throwing me off slightly is the price tag of this Nasi Campur. $25. $25. $25. 
Not the most photogenic dish around but the Nasi Campur definitely stole our tastebuds tonight. Candlenut never fails to deliver the ultra lemak Peranakan flavors — especially that beef rendang, homemade sambal &amp; fried salted vegetable duck ball!
Crusty Baguette filled with house made cold cuts, chicken liver pate, mayonnaise, pickles, cucumber shallot and the all important coriander. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />Banh Mi Ga (💵S$16) \n<br />This Banh Mi comes stuffed with shredded roast chicken, pate, mayonnaise, pickles, cucumber, shallot and cucumber. Both Banh Mis are good enough to satisfy my cravings but the pop up only lasts for a day hence, Vietnam I’m coming back for more. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />Cha Gio (💵S$6) \n<br />An addictive finger food to order while waiting for your Banh Mi to arrive, these little morsels are filled with Prawn &amp; Pork, lettuce &amp; fresh herbs then pan fried. The skin can be a little more crispy but I ain’t complaining as the flavours of the spring roll made up for it.
This time, it’s with Le Garçon Saigon &amp; Le Petit Saigon from Hong Kong! \n<br />Think layers of cured meat, vegetables &amp; more meat stuffed between freshly baked baguette. \n<br />We were in for a treat with the Banh Mi Thit ($16), Banh Mi Ga ($16) &amp; the Cha Gon ($6). The difference between the two Banh Mi was either having the cold cuts, or roast chicken! Either ways, they were equally good (even though they were stuffed with so much vegetables). This is probably my pre Vietnam trip training for bread &amp; vegetables 🙊 •\n<br />•\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG
The two banh mi on showcase today includes the Banh Mi Thit ($16), a classic Vietnamese bread roll stuffed generously with cold cuts, chicken liver pate and lots of fresh vegetables while the Banh Mi Ga ($16) is slightly different which used shredded roasted chicken as the meat.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Park Bench Deli\n<br />Address: 179, Telok Ayer Road, Singapore 068627\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #pbdgoesviet #parkbenchdeli #banhmi #legarconsaigon

the amazeballs deluxe double cheeseburger ($20) from rosita’s deluxe. available today as part of a pop up with park bench deli. the burger patties were deliciously moist and loosely packed, possessing a great bite and a wonderful charred crust. they paired perfectly with the melty cheese, tangy mustard, tart pickles and the sweet caramelized onion. all this was lovingly ensconced within a soft, fluffy bun. so sinful but oh-so-good. will be dreaming about it for days #rositasdeluxe #parkbenchdeli #burger #cheeseburger #beef #cheese #caramelizedonion #chilicheesefries #fries
the cheese and fried toast is amazing together with sliced pork! Go if you got extra fats to burn.
Was going to gamble getting the chili cheese tater tots but they couldn\'t sell it cos of lack of ingredients. The kind staff/owners said a good timing would be after Tuesdays, when stocks come in. \n<br />Just wanted to try the sandwiches as fresh as I can before I start to takeaway orders in the future.

Good thing I met my friend for dinner because it\'s so nice to just chill and talk for ages when a restaurant is not super crowded. Probably got judged for moving my food from one table to another to take this photo cause #aesthetics but whatever 🤷🏻‍♀️ Anyway, I shared these two sandwiches with my friend so we got two flavours each! While I do admit that it is quite yummy and the sauce is really on point (the sauce for the Cubano really has a kick), I feel the price doesn\'t really justify the portion size. Perhaps I had high expectations after seeing pictures online, or perhaps I\'m comparing this to the much more filling sandwich at Hungry Bazterdz at about the same price (but in a smellier less well-ventilated location). Maybe I was really hungry too. But in any case, I might go back to try the other options if I\'m in the area. Maybe. It also helps that the staff are super friendly and the interior is really #interiorgoals ! #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #parkbenchdeli #cbdlunch #cbddinner #arizonatea

Their version is made with sliced beef brisket, griddles onions, molten cheese sauce all stuffed in a hoagie roll.

.\n<br />The Burpple x Deliveroo partnership came at the right moment when I was undecided on what to eat and where to go for my TGIF lunch. Fortunately, Deliveroo is able to deliver food from one of my favourite spots in the CBD without me needing to head out in the humid weather. Overall, the ordering process to delivery was an ease as I got my food in less than half an hour.\n<br />.\n<br />Now, let’s talk about the food, but where should I begin? Let’s start off with the Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($14) which consists of rye bread and that luxurious cheddar and emmenthal cheese mix. Served with a serving of tomato soup dip, this is the absolute comfort food but prepare for the massive avalanche of food coma coming your way. Next up, my all-time favourite, the Cheese Steak ($16), which is a hoagie roll stuffed with sliced beef brisket, griddle onions and a molten cheese sauce. Indulgence is an understatement as you devour the massive sandwich portion by portion. Wash it all down with a bottle of Noah’s Creative Juice ($5.50) and I recommend you get the Orange smoothie which contains orange juice, apple juice, guave puree, banana, pineapple and a dash of paw paw puree.\n<br />.\n<br />Because you deserve the best, for the upcoming Deliveroo’s Western Week, there will be a 1-for-1 promotion from 1 to 7 Aug.\n<br />.\n<br />Park Bench Deli\n<br />Address: 179, Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068627 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood  #cafehopping #cafesg #BYDTB #BurppleROO #DeliverooSG #ParkBenchDeli #sandwiches #telokayer

yes, I have found THE ONE. if I could bold and underline, highlight and put those words to font 72, I would. something so simple made so darn good - the toast crunches, like CRUNCHES and the cheese is thick and gooey enough for me to be able to streeetttcccchhh it out with every bite. OMFG. if anyone can bring me to a place where they serve even better grilled cheese sandwiches, that meal is on me! for now, this is definitely number one on my list (that tomato soup comes as a side with the sandwich but I think it tastes great just drizzling some over the sandwich. I put a spoonful over my sandwich with every bite)\n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @parkbenchdeli #parkbenchdeli #grilledcheese #grilledcheesesandwich
i have been satisfied ♥️ I have been craving for this huge-till-my-fingers-are-all-stretched-out Cured Meats Sandwich for the longest time and I finally got to try it today! to be honest, I didn\'t know it was gonna come as cold cuts but that doesn\'t make it any less delish than I would have liked it to be!! 😋 even though I was already very full (see next photo), I couldn\'t NOT finish this \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @parkbenchdeli #parkbenchdeli #curedmeats #salami #ham #sandwich #brunch
all I want now is a cuppa of hot tea to wash off this nauseous feeling.
Decent but not as good as Artistry\'s.
Everything else is a bonus - like the smoked salmon and the sriracha cream cheese in this case. This is The Lox from @parkbenchdeli. Start your day right. \n<br />#burpple #parkbenchdeli
