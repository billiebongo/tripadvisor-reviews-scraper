The French toast probably had more egg in it than a Seng Choon enthusiast convention, and the ham was delectably meaty and substantial. Elsewhere, the ice cream possessed more than mere wisps of bacon\'s signature salty grit, but the substitution effort was akin to Leticia Bongnino-for-an-actual-Mother at best. 3.7/5\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Bochinche.
If you work in the Tanjong Pagar area and have yet to savour the set lunch at boCHINche, it\'s time to right that wrong. This modern Argentinian restaurant serves what we reckon is the most value-for-money lunch set in this guide. The Prix Fixe Menu comes with a choice of Two Courses ($27) and Three Courses ($32, includes dessert) with dishes rotating weekly. Before heading down, check their Instagram for the latest menu. Thankfully, the crowd-favourite rib-eye steak is a mainstay ‚Äî think 180g of meltingly tender Argentinian beef served with a side of wedges and a yummy chimichurri mayo. During our meal there, we thoroughly enjoyed the alternative main of prawn and scallop open lasagna, and their excellent dessert of sponge cake with mixed berries and yerba mate sorbet. Portions are generous, so we recommend sharing one dessert between two! \n<br />Avg Price: $35 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayne Tan
Scoured the web for a good deal on a executive set lunch and since I was hankering for beef, we settled on this. A steal at $27 for 2 courses and $32 for 3, the portion for the mains was generous and oh so tasty. My dining partner loved his shrimp and scallop open lasagne while I had the ribeye. It was a little too big for me but I still ate it all up. Just a minor complaint was that the salted part was way too salty for me to handle (and I like salt) and I had to scrap it off. It was done medium rare to perfection and very delicious. Definitely a must try and super easy on the wallet too!
Milk cake, mixed berries, yerba mate sorbet, crumble. 
Prawn, scallop open lasagna &amp; lemon
180g ribeye, chips, chimichurri mayo. 
Okay I\'ll be honest - when I saw this on the menu for the third course of the set lunch, I was kinda underwhelmed and not really wanting to spend $5 more for it and wanted to just go for the 2-course at $27. What an absolute idiot I would\'ve been if we didn\'t go for the 3-course, cos this is one helluva gorgeous dessert that got us swooning. The sponge cake gets a generous injection of milk, the mixed berries are generous and very tart, while the Yerba mate sorbet was more like luscious ice cream, tasting botanical and herby and beautiful. This was killer. BUT, share it, the lunch set is filling!!
The other option in the set lunch, perfect for sharing with your friend who\'s definitely getting the steak. These two mains complemented each other really well, with this one being comforting and hearty while the steak is totally indulgent. This dish was so generous in the amount of prawns and scallops hidden under that lasagna sheet, immersed in a broth that made it a really comforting stew-like dish. It also came studded with chunks of mushrooms and artichokes that were lovely. The fried dill on top was such a good touch! You know if I\'m not really feeling like steak, I wouldn\'t be any less happy with this dish.
Wow. There are two options for the set lunch ($27 for 2, $32 for 3-course), of which one is this stupendously good steak. Of course, bochinche\'s known for the quality of their meats, and the cookery was so perfect over the flames right in front of you. With the right amount of sea salt flakes and the super light wedges on the side, I haven\'t had a steak this good at this price ever. It comes with a tasty chimichurri mayo on the side, which goes very well with everything, but is also not needed since the beef on its own makes your eyes roll back. If you\'re eating in a pair, please share this and the other main option, the Prawn &amp; Scallop Open Lasagna that\'s excellent too. I\'ll be dreaming of this steak.
The only starter available in the set lunch ($27 for 2, $32 for 3-course). This was delightful. Most starters of set lunches we\'ve had are pretty boring and small portioned, but this dish totally nailed it. A light tuna mousse piped into the egg was salty and awakening, while the tang from the salad balanced it and the sweet from the almond \"garrapinada\" was a nice touch. A great way to start a meal.
This needs no photoshop or superlatives. Awesome hollandaise sauce on the eggs torched and served on a generous bed of hand shredded braised oxtail on char grilled toast. This is how honest, down to earth goodness should be.
It doesn\'t seem right if you go to an Argentinean restaurant and you don\'t order the steak especially if you are a meat lover! All the steaks here are imported from Argentina. There are skirt, sirloin, rib eye and beef fillet/tenderloin. The rib eye, cooked medium rare was juicy and succulent, however there was a fatty part which was a bit too chewy for me. Next time i will try another cut then!
Grilled asparagus and scallion, organic eggs (the chef told me they\'re excellent quality ones from NZ), girolles cream &amp; smoked ricotta, perfectly cooked, great combination of flavours and textures, topped with fresh herbs which was excellent! Highly recommended!
This was highly recommended by a friend when I said I was going to boCHINche for dinner, and I wasn\'t disappointed! Cracking into the caramelised sugar top, the dulce de leche custard base Creme Br√ªl√©e ($17) melts in your mouth leaving a creamy, sweet finish. Banana split flavoured ice cream was a bonus tho could do without. Calories don\'t count for dessert.
Here for 3 nights only for Comilona, they will serve their 5-course degustation menu ($150++ or $190++ with wine pairing) from 26-28 October at 7.30pm. They even brought their own ingredients here. Friday slot is already fully booked.

With an¬†ever changing set lunch menu, we went straight for their hunky 180g Sirloin steak¬†served with lightly salted chunky potato wedges and on the side, chimichurri mayo to complement (2 Courses $27/ 3 Courses $32). Simple yet sophisticated, I really enjoyed the natural flavours as the seasoning was kept to a minimum yet each bite was filled with savoury goodness. And worth every single penny, the star of the show was definitely the stellar steak which was juicy, nicely pink in the center and had a great meaty bite!
The stretchy cheese captured our palates, but only for the first few mouths; it was just too heavy and gelat after a few mouths. Thank goodness for the Salsa and Bone Marrow Butter that was served with the bread. Also had the Grilled Octopus with Pickled Mussels, Black Tomatoes and Burnt Onion, which we both enjoyed :)\n<br />.\n<br />Grateful that this woman is always around me to hear my rants and always giving me advices and encouragements. Here\'s to many more years of bitching and HTHTs, whereever we are ‚ù§Ô∏è
Crab on toast: humita, pickled turnips, chopped coriander. A simple started with hell lot of flavours. Sweet and fresh chunks of crab, creamy humita, and slices of well-toasted homemade bread ‚Äî all these add up to a refreshing and light starter. Absolutely stunning flavours packed into such a small bite.
In a neighboring plate, a hearty ragout of portobello mushroom and potato ($25) is deeply steeped in flavor, a thick slice of sourdough toast beneath soaks up its sweetness, two beautifully poached eggs and sliced iberico (aged 30 months) crowning the dish.
Thick, juicy coin-medallions of octopus, sprinkled with a dash of paprika, served with sweet green pea pur√©e, and tangy mussel escabeche. It seems so simple, yet the complex flavours and techniques make this a starter so deeply satisfying.
A hearty ragout of portobello mushroom and potato is deeply steeped in flavor, a thick slice of sourdough toast beneath soaks up its sweetness, sliced iberico [aged 30 months] and two beautifully poached eggs balance atop, crowning it king.
A classic staple that must be had on each visit to Bochinche is this pan of glorious cheese, wit and crunch; honey as a contour, not a dominant note, a stage more melt than pull.
If you haven\'t tried this yet (even after my constant ravings), lunch plan tomorrow\'s settled. From the fluffy, soft brioche buns boasting sexy grill marks, the surprisingly sweet semi-dried tomatoes, to the moist and lean patty, nothing about this Chimmichurri Steak Burger fails to please. 
Such a thick cut\'s exceptionally challenging to cook: the line between underdone and overcooked is so fine, you could easily swing either way. But BoCHINche\'s execution was flawless. Juicy, moist, and glazed with a sticky sweet sauce. And let\'s not forget the accompanying apple relish I could easily finish on its own.
Totally in love with this bacon ice cream which has small bits of bacon that gives it a little twist in the texture. Check this out if you are having brunch at Bochinche. It is served with Brioche French Toast and House Cooked Ham. üòãüòãüòãüòãüòã
I must\'ve annoyed some people with my endless ravings over BoCHINche\'s burger the whole of last week. I could wax lyrical about this all day: from the soft and fluffy buns religiously charred on the grill, the mandoline-ed pickles, the saut√©ed sundried tomatoes, to the lean ribeye pattie. So do me a favour - don\'t trust me. Go have a taste yourself.
These dulce de leche pancakes are seriously one of its kind!
boCHINche\'s Chimmichurri Steak Burger stole my heart. This is the second time I\'m having it, and I must say it surpassed expectations. I remember enjoying it the first time, but nothing near today\'s sheer bliss. A lean steak pattie, topped with melted sharp provolone, bacon, pickles, caramelised onions, and that enticing sunny side up. The flavours were bombastic and rich, every ingredient doing its part. This, is now my new favourite burger.
My emotions are like this stretchy Provoleta cheese.
Starting with the refreshing, tart, and sweet scallops, and sea bass ceviche, plus all the delicious cured Iberico hams! üòç Monday blues are best cured with cured meats and a red! üç∑
Fibres and wisps of crab are embedded in a corn mash to make the filling; the salsa is a much needed accent to their smoothness.
Ok now.
I never understood the appeal, besides visual, of wagyu. I don\'t want my cow massaged with beer and lulled to sleep with soft jazz. I want it to live on grass on the plains and to have firm muscles that have been used. So this is my sort of steak.
Tastes exactly as its name describes - a winsome, orgiastic union of milk and cake, with the passionfruit sorbet bringing some tartiness to the party. 4/5
The crabmeat, possessing the gentle mushiness of a newly-in-love Saint Margaret\'s Secondary School student, was so gloriously steamy it should come with a parental advisory.  3.8/5 \n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Bochinche.
Classic Provoleta, almonds &amp; oregano honey (V). This is a super awesome starter for cheese lover!! üòçüòç
The playfully sweet, honey-soaked provoleta has the stringiness of the most refined mozzarella as well as the soft, resilient elasticity of chewing gum, and the soft fluffy bread wraps around it with the sensuality and comfort of a body-sheathing taffeta gown. 4.2/5 \n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Bochinche.
Like cheese? Like honey? Usually I\'m not a fan of sweet-salty combinations but THIS. This is the melted cheese to end all melted cheese cravings. Cheese melted in a nice cast iron pan, drizzled with honey, topped with almonds and served with fresh bread. This is one of those simple dishes that somehow combine together for an other worldly experience.
One of the better French Toasts around! Served with grilled ham slices and a scoop of Bacon Vanilla icecream. \n<br />Please just imagine how the ball of icecream ever-so-lovingly melted and seeped into the brioche that soaked it up like a sponge. Sign yourselves up at @bochinchesg. \n<br />19bucks/serving\n<br />#FTrecommends
Brunch with my boss man @bjornshen and his lady @r0x. The Classic Argentinian Provoleta (learn something new everyday) of cheeses/pulled curds, toasted almonds and honey syrup. Best consumed hot when it\'s mega stringy!\n<br />#partofmyjob #FTrecommends
A couple of poached eggs, chive hollandaise and braised Ossobuco (usually veal, but I think in this case, beef) on some sourdough toast. Rich, heavy, hearty, definitely left me satiated.  Sign yourselves up at @bochinchesg. \n<br />25bucks/serving\n<br />#FTrecommends bochinchesg 
‚ò∫Ô∏è It was one good experience! To wake up at 4am, to cycle as the sun rises above you. But not when you have to cycle up slope after slopes. üòÇ
Ham, bacon and vanilla? Not the typical union of flavours, but boCHINche\'s rendition proves it to work. The brioche French toast ($19) here plays on the balance between sweet and salty. Instead of the usual savoury bacon, it is topped with house-cooked ham, and the bacon takes on unusual forms like bacon-vanilla ice cream, and also as sprinkles of bacon bits. This might be one of the pricier French toasts around, and enjoying a luxurious brunch here is certainly not reserved for a normal weekend. Come for a birthday treat with your best friend, or for a day-time date! 
Brioche French Toast, House-cooked Ham, Bacon Vanilla Ice Cream ($19++)\n<br />Such a hot day. Best start with a scoop of ice cream on toast to cool down. The brioche is very soft and buttery while the ham is tasty. The ice cream is a balance of sweet and savoury of the bacon bits.
The hand cut fries is ladened with garlic oil instead of truffle oil. Me love! Stay away vampires!!! üòçüòçüòç
For something a little different and for a pinch of Argentinean feel, head to boCHINche, located right above Common Man Coffee Roasters. Start off with the Provoleta ($17), a sizzling dish of salty, gooey cheese balanced out with glorious honey and topped with almonds to provide crunch. With Pan and Manceta (Peurto Rican breads, $7) to go along, this is a winning dish that should be shared. The classic pairing of Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Eggs ($24) is elevated here by dill cream cheese slathered beneath. End on a sweet note with their popular Milk Cake ($14) ‚Äî made with three types of milk and also soaked in milk, it is a dessert so delicate on the palate, and pairs excellently with passionfruit sorbet. 
This beauty, crab on the toast, is one of the latest addition on bochinche\'s menu. Two types of crab meat mixed with humita to give a more textual bite with a lingering natural sweetness, this dish has won the hearts around the table. Me so much wanted some of these nwüò±üò±üò±
With seats sleeved in cotton calico fabric printed with interesting words like these, boCHINche formerly a modern restaurant loosens up with an exciting grocer market, a fresh new menu and a fun, casual vibe and more relaxed price point.
Do I like it? Nope, I don\'t. I LOVE IT!üòç Especially that soft and eggy French toast!üòã If only the bacon ice cream was a bigger serving though. üôäüôàüòÇ #greedyforlife #bochinchesg
All washed down with a good cup of latte ‚òïÔ∏è and chimichurri Bloody Mary üç∑‚ò∫Ô∏è This is the reason why we love brunch, especially on a weekend! And @boCHINchesg does it so right! üòãüëç Ps: not forgetting our sides which were so yummy too!
Reminiscing about this amazing dish I had a year or so back. Eaten with the Pan &amp; Manteca ($7++) ie. fluffy breads, it\'s a wonderful way to start a meal at Bochinche. Time to head back soon?
Classic Provoleta with Almonds &amp; Honey aka atas cheese that is served bubbling furiously as if it was shouting \"Eat Me! Eat Me\" !! Incredibly simple yet superbly sharp, mature, sweet, crunchy....forget about the focaccia at the back and just dig in while it\'s HOT
I\'m a fan of raw fish, so it\'s no surprise i love ceviche and this definitely hit the spot, being perfectly tart and firm (although the smaller pieces were a little mushy).
Delicious cured meats at an Argentinian resto
Ending it all off with a sweet finish. Whew. Fluffy as hell.
Bit strong but punctuated nicely by the sweetness from the honey. Nice texture contributed by the almonds too
This was a great chorizo. Ugh, too good. Miss it already.
Out of all the sweet x salty, bacon x confection renditions, Bochinche did it best, helped by the lightness of the ice cream
VERY wobbly eggs (read: perfectly poached) on braised ossobuco that made everything better
SO good and rich. I loved the texture of the pappardelle
Save the soggy bun at the bottom (not even sure why), this was pretty good. Wasn\'t a fan of the chimichurri but maybe because I didn\'t eat the entire burger together (small mouth problems), I couldn\'t taste if the flavours melded. Loved the bacon but i think if eaten with the cheese, it might have been too salty. Expected more from boCHINche given the price and what I\'ve read, but alas. My friend had the ossobucco with poached eggs and didn\'t like it. I would rather have spent my money at Common Man just right below. 
Just like the rest of the brunch menu. Argentinian brunch at BoCHINche has already started rolling every weekend 11am-3pm. Just reserve early to avoid hot seatsüòú!!
A plate of Lomo which features a beautiful 300g of beef fillet. It is a good and lean introduction steak to what Argentina has to offer. The meat is grilled perfectly ‚Äì tender without losing its shape.
This is the moreish Braised ossobuco with beautifully poached organic eggs and a chive hollandaise sauce. #bochinchesg
This is Chocolate Pudding and Salted Caramel with Berries &amp; Brioche Croutons. 
Here\'s Chef Jacquet‚Äôs award-winning ‚ÄúProvenzal‚Äù chips at Bochinche. You gotta eat them quickly while it\'s hot, just like the way you gonna feast and have fun on the weekend before it\'s gone. Happy Fryday Everyone!
You can eat it on its own or mix together for a full fantasy of flavor.
Grilled Lamb chops served with anchovies, salsa verde and chopped mint. 
Green asparagus with baked brie and grated granola. 
Beetroot and tomato salad, goat cheese garrapinada and marjoram. 
Roasted bone marrow served with caramelized onions, quince and parsley.  
Sea bream ceviche in tiger\'s milk and sweet potato. 
Crab on toast, humita, pickled turnips and chopped coriander. 
The Dulce de leche creme brulee is a combination of milk and sugar that has been slowly heated until it takes on a brown and caramel like appearance. 
Nothing more satisfying than s***t talking and good food with my homies.

A squid croquette actually - made with diced squid with lotsa interesting diced ingredients, bell pepper, onion, butter squash, is blended into a patty, battered and fried. Sandwiched between two squid ink bun. Go on, take a bite!
Now, in our country, the Argentineans has brought us an explosion of flavours.
I like the squid ink burger and ricotta pancakes! As usual, food quality here is üëç
This was how we started our weekend yesterday. Almost every dish as a hit for me. I definitely will return for my fifth visit, not only for brunch and dinner as well.

Delicious! 
A pretty filling dish stuffed with tender ox cheeks and strong onion flavors. The toast at the bottom makes this a filling dish.
Favorite dish of the night. Definitely ordering this again! 
This main acted as our starter. Octopus was light and chewy, and the flavors were good. Although I prefer it done medium rare just like steaks, with a tinge of rareness in the center. Small portions, so always order more!
Recommended by the server, the house-made pappardelle with ossobucco ragu, walnuts and smoked ricotta was absolutely fantastic.
Smoked salmon and scrambled eggs with red onions, capers, and dill cream cheese ($24) 
You don\'t actually need to fly to Buenos Aires to discover such inviting cuisine. To start it off, I\'m having the awesome Provoleta with Pan &amp; Manteca.
A far more substantial twist on eggs Benedict, but also far heavier on the stomach with meaty ox cheek in place of ham or smoked salmon. 
On two halves of a toasted olive oil-infused baguette are soft scrambled eggs and a heap of smoked salmon on cream cheese. The lovely smokey fragrance in the bread complements the toppings beautifully. Enhancing it all are piquant capers and thinly sliced Spanish onions. A great brunch item in my opinion. 
My friend\'s order of pasta - not bad, but not a wow, either. 
Originally comes with sunny-side-ups, but I requested to have the eggs poached instead - in hindsight, I wonder if I\'d have enjoyed them better fried, though, with a frill of crisp-edged whites. Asparagus was nicely grilled, but there wasn\'t enough of the truffle dressing to tie everything together. 
Quite a substantial amount of toppings, but that couldn\'t camouflage that stiffness of the pancakes themselves. 
Try them, they don\'t look or taste anywhere as squeamish as they sound. The braised pig\'s head has been prepared in such a way that it looks just like typical meat. But I must say, it\'s extra moist, flavourful and very tender; contrasting nicely with the crunchy coating. Pour the light and sweet quince sauce over the croquettes and let it soak for a bit before eating.\n
How sensuous it was to dig into the hot pan of thick, creamily oozy Provoleta cheese with chunks of assorted fresh Pan (house-made Argentinian breads, of which my fave\'s the round onion roll). I found the combination of the warm savoury cheese, sweet honey and sliced almonds remarkably delicious. This is a must-order at Bochinche.
the pancakes were not fluffy and tasted stale. too much baking soda maybe? anyway generous portion of fruits and a really good sauce.
our full brunch orders and I had to climb onto de chair to get de shot. happy weekend guys. weekends are precious. spend more time out instead of sleeping in
Ricotta pancakes with berries salad, maple syrup and cinnamon creme fraiche ($18)
Grilled Asparagus with poached eggs, pastrami, and truffle dressing ($23)  
The brioche is light and fluffy, eaten at my breakfast table and can be served as a dessert too. \n<br />I love the white peaches and toasted almonds, the lemon curd was a tad too sweet, as I normally like my lemon curd being sour. The vanilla ice cream melts really fast, and need to bolt it down quickly too. Overall, it\'s still an enjoyment for me.
Organic poached eggs on toast, braised ossobuco and chives hollandaise ($25)
House-made chorizo sausage, braised ox cheeks and caramelized onions ($25)
Watermelon Juice with a Hint of Mint served in an interesting clinical glass.  
Watching the #chefsatwork at #bochinche is interesting and fills you with anticipation.
This is the kind of pancakes that, with your first bite, make your eyes widen in surprise then close in blissful pleasure. They may look like messy blobs but trust me, they are the best tasting messy blobs ever. Texture-wise, they are very soft and light. Served with assorted berries, a cinnamon creme fraiche and some finely-chopped mint (at least, that\'s what I think it was), this will hit the sweet spot if you are in the mood for something that isn\'t full-on savoury.
What an explosion of flavours this burger packs! Love the juicy well-marinated beef patty, provolone cheese, grilled tomatoes, caramalised onions and god-knows-what-other-good-stuff they have in there. Man oh man, I\'m heading back very soon for more.
A must-order appetizer if you love all things cheese! What an irresistible dish, a perfect combination of gooey salty cheese with sweet honey and sliced almonds. Don\'t miss this. $16

Milk Cake, Passionfruit Sorbet &amp; Toasted Almonds. The sorbet was too sweet, but the milk cake in a puddle of condensed milk was oh-so-delectable in all its moist, fluffy glory. #milk #cake #sorbet #passionfruit #dessert #sweet #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Beef \"Chimichurri\" Burger. Don\'t remember if there was any chimichurri, actual or semblance of, but I do remember that the beef was quite juicy and came crowned with a thick layer of melted provolone and ultra-sweet caramelised onions. \n<br />#burger #beef #cheese #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Roast &amp; Pickled Beetroot, Goat\'s Curd &amp; \"Garrapi√±ada\". Essentially goat\'s cheese croquettes with rocket and beetroot. Didn\'t eat the croquettes cos I loathe anything goat. #goatcheese #croquettes #rocket #beetroot #salad #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Grilled Breast of Quail, Braised Leg, Lentils &amp; Sherry Glaze. Only had a tiny bite of this cos I\'m not a fan of quail - something about the texture puts me off - but I thought it was well-flavoured with a lightly smokey char. #quail #game #lentils #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Grilled Watermelon Salad, Tomatoes, Mozzarella &amp; Sunflower Seeds. Just a light, refreshing mid-meal course.

Scallops, Sweet Potato, Soy-Honey Roasted Pork Belly &amp; Chorizo.

Only wish the pork belly had a more melt-in-the-mouth texture. #scallops #pork #porkbelly #sweetpotato #chorizo #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Grilled Octopus, Smoked Leeks &amp; Tuna Mayo. Octopus was nicely caramelised on the outside, with a non-rubbery bite that I actually liked. #octopus #purple #potatoes #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Provoleta, Almonds &amp; Honey. One of my favourites here - grilled provolone cheese infused with honey and topped with sliced almonds. Unbelievably delish! #cheese #provolone #provoleta #argentinianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
in ny opinion its tooo sweet. the milk cake could do with milk and not condensed milk. de sorbet itself is too sweet. aside, the cake was super moist and delicious
Moist MILK Cake with passion fruit sorbet and toasted almonds. I don\'t know why, but just the name MILK made this cake sound so appealing to me. It\'s deliciously dense, yet fluffy similar to a sponge cake texture.

Can\'t get enough of them Argentinian small plates! Full review out on Six&amp;Seven.
Thinking about this mega cheese-y Provoleta ($18++) that swept me off my feet towards the end of 2017.
Ribeye ($35 for 3 Course Set Lunch)\n<br />.\n<br />Been hearing so much about @Bochinchesg and how worth-it their set lunches are so I finally found the opportunity to pay them a visit. Wow. The Rib-eye couldn‚Äôt be better! 180g of perfectly cooked medium rare rib eye served with well-seasoned chips and housemade chimichurri mayo. The rib-eye was just pure awesomeness till the end! The chunky chips paired really well with the mayo too. I‚Äôm sure to revisit this place for the steak! The counter-seat was an experiece, watching all those slabs of beef getting flamed by the charcoal grill is really a sight to behold.
Yeah enuf has been said. Totally made us forget about the bread and cheese lol. Super smoky and tender with great maillard reaction. Well this lives up to the hype but I quite liked the crispy chips as well. Oh yeah the steak was really juicy it was almost squirting when u cut into it(with the very aesthetically pleasing knife)

YUMS. If you haven\'t tried this, you must - one of my favourite dishes from their menu. #MediaTasting
I\'m a sucker for avocado in brunch settings and boCHINche does a rather magnificent rendition of the classic avo on toast. Don\'t be intimidated if the first ingredient stated on the dish is something that is foreign to you. I approached Faina with apprehension only to find out that the magic rug below the mounds of crushed and seasoned avocado and fried eggs was a pancake made of chickpea flour. To add to the pageantry of this dish is coriander and \"aji molido\" creme fraiche which red pepper beginnings add a bit of feisty dimension to the dish. I shouldn\'t have been worried at all.
üçæ // Probably the best marriage ever.
Provolone cheese, a type of cow\'s cheese, originally from Italy but very common in Argentina, grilled with almonds and drizzled with oregano honey and herbs, it has gooey  texture while it is warm, but it gets a bit rubbery when it gets colder. So i would recommend for you to quickly savour it right after it is served! A must for cheese lovers like me. Great for sharing!

More deets are up on the blog :)\n<br />#COMILONA2016 #COMILONAsg #bochinche #bochinchesg #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #whatiate #burpple #hungrygowhere #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #whatiate #whatiatetoday #yummers #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger #foodphotography #sgeats #eatoutsg #foodmania #thingsieat
Wow
Luscious and cheesy, I was really impressed by the¬†Argentinian specialty and loving the browned and crisp bits seared by the skillet.
Can\'t stop thinking about this \"Provoleta\" ($17) -  We were told that it was heavy so we gave up ordering another dessert but as it turns out, we loved this so much and well, it wasn\'t gelat until the very end when it started to solidify. So try not to wait too long to dig in. Think piping hot, stretchy, savoury melted provolone cheese in its golden brown glory, with crunchy almonds for an added contrast in texture, and sweet, sweet Oregano honey for a good balance in flavours. Definitely a good starter. Get this to share though it was so good, I can probably finish it all by myself!! üòõ 
We always love to sit at the chefs bar and were impressed with the attention to detail on every single dish before it left the kitchen. Service was excellent from start to finish, from the fresh tangy #ceviche to homemade breads with #bonemarrowbutter #meltinyourmouth #argentinian #fillet and don\'t even start me on the #dulcedeleche #cremebrulee #bochinchesg #singaporefood #sgfood #singapore #burpple #burpplesg

üòè beneath all that Rosemary and Smoked Garlic lies a well-Grilled Half Chicken. okay, I must say, out of all the dishes we had on the table today, this probably looked the most boring but that doesn\'t mean it tastes inferior, okay?? next time I will show you the side view so you all can see the beauty of the meat itself üòÜ
I can\'t take my eyes away from that wobbling yolk! üòÇ

\"saaayyy what!?\" - no kidding. this was a wonderful marriage of very very soft bread with tender ham on one slice (it almost felt like I was having pork chop cos the slices were so thick) and bacon bits with vanilla ice cream on another. don\'t ask me how they go together. I would say they\'re almost like that couple you see on the street and you go \"how are THEY compatible?\" but they just are üòã
it\'s sweet, it\'s savoury, it is super addictive! for lovers of cheese, this variant of Argentine pulled-curd Provolone cheese is a must-have at @bochinchesg and seriously I think if I\'m going back again, I want to have one all to myself, no sharing allowed (serving is just perfect for ME ‚úãüèºand I\'m pretty sure I can handle another one) \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #brunch #breakfast @bochinchesg #bochinchesg #bochinche #provolone #provolonecheese #argentine
