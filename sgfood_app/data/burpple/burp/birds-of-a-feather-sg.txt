Sweet &amp; Fruity cocktail recommended by the waitress. I don\'t really fancy cocktails because I feel diluted or rather \"cheated\" with little alcohol, a lot of ice, colour syrups, soda or water. 😂
Brownie top with Tahitian vanilla Chantilly, surrounded by candy cloud and espresso shot~ 
Less mala 麻辣 spiciness, more tomato richness this round but overall still very good. Good to note that they now serve it with the sourdough without request. Birds eggs always live up to expectations!
It\'s such a pretty place, always uplighting to drop by again! The garden decor and large open skylight that opens up to the natural light above is always so inviting, even if it\'s just for a cup of coffee after lunch.
Glad that I finally made it to the beautiful space called Birds of a feather! I like everything here- food, ambience and service! Special shout out to Vincent of @birdsofafeather for the great service!\n<br />.\n<br />Featured: GWC Brownie Dessert (S$15++)\n<br />Swipe to see more! 👉\n<br />.\n<br />This is a lightly sweetened coffee and macademia nut brownie made from GWC (Goodwood Coffee). It is served with vanilla chantilly, coffee \"soil\", candy \"clouds\" and espresso by the side. I like that you can adjust the sweetness of the dessert by the amount of espresso you pour in! Generally a bittersweet dessert suitable for those who dislike sweet desserts.\n<br />.\n<br />Where to find this?\n<br />Birds of a feather\n<br />📍\n<br />115 Amoy Street L1-01, S069935\n<br />⏰\n<br />Mon: 11am to 10pm\n<br />Tue/Wed: 10am to 11pm\n<br />Thu-Sat: 11am to 12mn\n<br />Sun: 10am to 10pm
This Xiang Su Duck from a week ago has totally changed my views on eating duck meat; totally didn\'t know eating duck is such an art too 😂 in an east meets west fusion, I was told to begin from the starters inwards to the braised duck breast, with the flavours to be enhanced through sips of tea and then finally on to the duck confit.
Braised pig ear served cold with Sichuan red &amp; sour dressing and arrowroot noodles
Getting bored with Sichuan Peppercorn Popcorn chicken 辣子雞🐔Great variant to this popular dish in BoaF refreshed menu! And shhh... its really much much better! Don\'t miss out on the legs of the shrimps, that\'s where the flavours reside! Love their idea to use oriental chive (韭黃) and leek to compliment the shrimps - loving that unique flavour. Don\'t say I never warn you, it\'s gonna get spicy!
A rare non-spicy dish at BoaF, to get that non-spicy eater friend of yours to join you for lunch. Braised pork slices, with mushroom and a runny egg, served with chips and greens.
Wasnt spicy at all but still an impressive dish. Only gripe was that the portion was too small
Really well done comfort food and tantalizing spice. The smell teases ur senses before it even reaches the table. Panini was super crispy and the accompanying sweet potato and potato side was just spicy enuf to keep you going back for more. Tomato salsa was super fresh and refreshing.
Not only pretty to look at; the meringue atop BOF\'s special Feather’s coffee served more than an embellishment as it nicely sweetens the aromatic coffee with each sip you take.
A medley of chorizo sausage, Camembert cheese, potato and 2 molten core baked eggs amidst the greens &amp; chilli crisp in Birds\' version of Shashouka, is indeed looking like another BoaF signature in the making. Love their rich but moist tomato base with a familiar tinch of Sichuan peppercorn, which seems to work out so well on all the items in their menu. Would have been perfect if they serve it with some toasted sour dough, which I did order separately to wipe clean the skillet. Yums.
Nothing escapes the claws of Sichuan Peppercorn and Mala chili oil at BoaF, not even the innocent sounding open face sandwich in their newly launched weekend brunch menu. The roasted chicken is mixed into the rich avocado to give it a nice creamy texture. You almost thought their is no spice in this dish, but the nice hint of the peppercorn must have been infused into the mixture - knowingly or unknowingly. The nice greens and interesting dried chilli, renkon (lotus root) crisp are recurring features in their dishes but always aptly complimenting the main course. Aji-egg was a nice touch to this new dish which I am sure would be yet another signature here at Birds.
Find the chicken ($16) was aptly named because it was, quite literally, an exercise in sourcing out those morsels of chicken bathed in a spicy tongue numbing sauce. \n<br />The chicken avocado salad ($20) sounded promising but the marriage of the two ingredients didn\'t do it for me. Or perhaps it was the blandness of those chicken strips buried in the avocado half. Quite the difference from the former. \n<br />That said, they do have a lovely lovely space and it must look gorgeous in the daytime too.
Essentially the spiritual sequel to their popular Find the Chicken in the Chillies. Underneath the river shrimp\'s gently crispy exterior lies a Sensitive New Age Guy-esque masculine softness, and the \"mala\" heat mileage for the dish varies - the naked river shrimp alone reveals just a feathery tease of sting, whilst a careless spoonful may yield a significantly more insistent numbing and sensuous plumping of the lips. 3.8/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Birds of a Feather.
This dish is one of the many items on the restaurant\'s new menu which launches 6 April, and other friends joining the avian party include the Pig Ear Mosaic, \"Xiang Su\" Duck, the black-and-white black sesame dessert MonoTone, and a naughty deep-fried shrimp sequel to the popular Find The Chicken In the Chillies. Spanking new weekend brunch offerings such as the eggtastic Bird Skillet and Big Bird First (big breakfast? geddit? - Joke Tuition Teacher) will also be introduced the same week.
Loving this 香酥Duck done 2 ways, confit and braised, with a traditional spicy Tian Mian duck jus. More on stories! Coming to your table from 6 April! Lots of 😍😍😍for this place! Also expect a weekend brunch menu too!
The nondescript entrance that seemed to almost magically appear only when we doubled back along the row of shops a second time lured us into its dark interior. Decked out with lush foliage within and a tastefully eclectic collection of furniture, we were off to a good start. Most of us ended up choosing the Oriental Bolognese ($20) which seemed to be one of the top items on the menu. It was a tasty combination of angel hair pasta and pork ragout, seasoned with Sakura ebi and topped with a wobbly onsen tamago to mix in. Unfortunately, the wilted kale which had an awfully plastic-y artificial taste spoilt the otherwise harmonious blend of flavours and left an unpleasant taste in our mouths. #burpple
🎂🍰 May my wish for both of u come true soon k! 😉😂😜\n<br />.\n<br />#birdsofafeather #gyoza
Have a terrific Thursday my dears 💋
Would definitely return to this place \n<br />TL: spicy crispy trotters - absolutely loved this dish, it was worth the calories &amp; indulgence (as advised by the servers, go easy on the spices as they can get too savoury) \n<br />BL: the feature cup - good coffee with a sweet soufflé \n<br />BR: Grilled cheese panini with braised pull pork #throwbackbrunch #burrple
Featuring their Spicy Oriental Oriental Bolognaise ($22) and Find The Chicken in The Chiliies ($16) which is 辣子雞，which i also ate  at Chong Qing Grilled Fish yesterday. Is it just me or i feel that angel hair is like atas mee kia?! 😂😂😂
Sichuan-inspired Western cuisine - this was very very good. Our whole party adored the Oriental Bolognese, 10/10 would recommend!! As you can see from the pic, I was too excited to eat this that I couldn\'t even take a proper still photo of this. The vibes and space are very on point as well, this is really one of the more outstanding establishments I\'ve visited in awhile 🤤
Neighbours to Ding Dong and Bochinche, Birds of a Feather is the perfect date spot for those working in the CBD. The snazzy place on Amoy Street hits the sweet spot in our books — memorable Sichuan-inspired dishes, excellent cocktails and an overall relaxed vibe in a gorgeous setting. Splurge on the spicy Find the Chicken in the Chillies ($16), a cheeky appetizer that features little morsels of chicken fried hidden in an abundance of dried chillies. Otherwise, its best to put your money towards the Spicy Oriental Bolognaise ($22), their rendition of zha jiang mian made with angel hair pasta, pork ragout, kale and sakura ebi — incredibly tasty. End the meal with their deceivingly humble-looking Glutinous Rice Cake ($12), where flat chewy rice cakes are topped with soy powder and Okinawan black sugar. Pro tip: Squeeze in a little lunch date here — get the Spicy Oriental Bolognaise along with the lunch exclusive of Grilled Cheese Panini ($20) with braised pork belly and pickled cabbage.\n<br />Avg Price: $60 per couple\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jonathan Wong
A generous dusting of soy powder and lush black sugar syrup.-\n<br />This dish stole the show! The simple unassuming dish was nostalgic and heartwarming.\n<br />-\n<br />A great end to a fiery meal.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #birdsofafeathersg
-\n<br />Crispy pork trotters in a bag. Throw in the spices provided and shake your tail feather. The resulting dish is a spicy fatty explosion in your mouth.\n<br />-\n<br />Monster Loves anything that\'s fat!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #birdsofafeathersg
The tofu cheese patty was very soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. However I found the bun cold and a little too starchy. It was stuck onto the serving paper.. \n<br />The fried potato and sweet potato had an interesting taste though! Especially the sweet potato which was coated with some spice powder ($22++)
The cheesy tofu patty plays the role of the meat and it delivers.\n<br />-\n<br />It\'s rich and thick, going together with the meat sauce to give that spicy meaty kick you\'d expect from a burger.\n<br />-\n<br />Monster is impressed and is waiting to be surprised by what\'s coming up next.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #birdsofafeathersg #burpple
Mapo pork ragu, tofu cheese party, pickled cucumbers in a house made bun, served with fried potatoes and sweet potatoes. Second time I\'m having it, and I\'m still loving it! #burpple #birdsofafeathersg
An East-meet-West rendition of the traditional Chinese dessert - cheng tng, Birds of a Feather’s Poached Pear ($12) sadly did not really work for me; as the smokey-citrusy flavour from the scoop of Orange Caramel ice cream ended with a slightly bitter aftertaste that seeked to overwhelm and was more prominent when paired with the bits of ginger. (I am not a fan of ginger, too) Nonetheless, a unique combination, this plated dessert carried a nice array of textures with the usual accompaniments of longan and snow fungus but also a soft, fork-tender poached pear. Refreshing and delicate, the pear was able to soaked up and meld the flavours (citrus and bittersweet) perfectly.
Yolk porn aside — as if anything else could be as important — this Oriental Bolognese is definitely my fave of what we tried from their lunch menu. Angel Hair pasta\'s a tad overcooked, wilted kale had too much salt, but being generously tossed in that suuuuuper flavourful pork ragout was enough of a lifesaver. It was rich, fragrant, sporting copius amounts of meat both fatty and lean.
One of the more interesting burgers I\'ve seen of late, though not as impressive as I thought it\'d be. Word out there\'s that their Mapo Tofu Burger\'s pretty revolutionary, with a cheesy tofu patty and fab sweet potato fries. Gotta put it right out there that I\'m an absolute fan of the fries and the really fluffy and moist buns; but idk if I got an odd patty or if my tastebuds were just playing punk that day — there was this overwhelming raw garlic-like flavour that was just a major turn off. The kind of raw garlic that burns and lingers and ruins the taste of everything that comes after it.
It\'s for true macha lover, the type who like their macha-\"GAO\" (thick) and unsweetened. Served in a equally interesting Japanese feel earthware, the sipping of the green tea latte amidst the lush greeneries in the cafe, cest la vie, if only everyday is a Sunday.
This Oriental Bolognese  at hipster Sze Chuan resto @birdsofafeathersg had me stealing more bites than what I usually would have. Modern zha jiang mian this is, with angel hair pasta, Pork ragout, onsen egg. I\'d make it a Singaporean with some added spice!
Opted for the Grilled Cheese Panini ($18). The exterior of both slices of bread sandwiching the thin slices of pork belly gives way with an unbelievable thundering crunch in every bite into it. Underneath the bread is a layer of grilled cheese, followed by pickles and then the pork. So, very, good. Not very often that I make good choices, but this definitely a choice well-made. Luckily I didn\'t give in to the temptation of getting the Oriental Bolognaise again - our fav from the last visit during the soft launch. Both are going to be my top orders here. 
This was a step out of our comfort zone with our poor tolerance to spicy food but so glad we did! My favorite has got to be the interesting east-meets-west fusion of Oriental Bolognaise ($20) that was one umami party with the tingly numbness kicking in slowly but surely. With perfectly al dente angel hair pasta tossed in savour pork ragout, Sakura ebi, onsen tamago and wilted kale, these were surprisingly comforting elements inspired by soybean paste noodles. Opted for the spicy version with additional $2 and survived so I say go for it!

The flavours of the whole dish was really really full, well spiced and oh so tasty. Mixed in the egg and give the noodles a creamier finish. Definitely a must order here!!
@birdsofafeathersg\'s special coffee, pretty decent coffee topped with torched meringue- both pleasing to the sight 👀 and the tastebuds. Getting your dose of caffeine while sweetening your Monday at the same time - cause why not?

Something to soothe the throat after all that Szechuan spice @birdsofafeathersg. A @superfinefeline told me that hot cocktails are in now 😍and we both agreed there must be less alcohol in them so it\'s ok to have more! Cheers to that!! 😘😘See more on stories!
FINALLY their much raved about Oriental Bolognaise and every mouth is almost as satisfying as they say! 😋
The Beef Brisket set beautifully on the focaccia &amp; bed of rocket, lettuce, chili &amp; cilantro. The Beef Brisket 牛腱 has the tinge of Szechuan pepper flavour. Sprinkle on the red chili powder and chili oil in scallion for added flavours.
Have a beautiful Sunday my dears 💋

Oriental Bolognaise (SGD$20.00) consisted of angel hair pasta, pork ragout, onsen tamago (poached egg), wilted kale and sakura ebi (small shrimps). If one wishes for spicy, simply top up SGD$2.00 for that fiery touch.
A fruity meringue sitting atop a coffee base. Loving the sweet meringue.\n<br />Much needed after traumatising myself (and maybe my Macbook Air) whole playing around with scripts. 😅 The path to automation…\n<br />#BirdsOfAFeatherSG *
One of the better espresso Cubes in Singapore! Comes with chocolate syrup
Charcoal grilled beef patty, foie gras, cheddar, caramelised onions, lettuce, chilli soy tapenade, fried (sweet) potato. 
Angel hair pasta, pork ragout, onsen tamago, kale and sakura ebi (small shrimps). 
Achievement unlocked: I\'ve tried all 4 desserts on the menu, and my favorite is.. this poached pear!\n<br />🔸\n<br />I started with a bite of the pear, it was so refreshing and delicately sweet. The sweetness came from both the pear itself and the ingredients of the cold soup where the taste of longan and snow fungus is most distinctive, together with a whiff of orange citrus and ginger.\n<br />🔸\n<br />It came with orange caramel ice cream which I felt overpowered everything else because it was too sweet and too heavy (milky). I would have preferred if they do away with the ice cream completely, or replace it with a fruity sorbet.
Interesting fusion dish. We\'re familiar with mapo tofu, but how do they make it into a burger?\n<br />🔸\n<br />They\'ve cleverly used the minced meat with numbing chilli as the patty topping, while tofu binded with cheese is the burger patty itself. This protein heavy dish is refreshed by pickles cucumbers.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I would prefer a silky tofu thats fried till externally crispy as a patty, but this is a clever fusion that\'s well executed because the tofu patty itself does have similarities to the texture of a regular meat patty.
You don\'t know what you\'ll get until you pick up a stick. Let your fortune decide, hence the name.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I like the spicy soup that I find myself drinking them off a spoon even after we\'re done with all the skewers. It has both the chilli padi type of sharp spice, as well as the Szechuan peppers type of numb spice. I like the combination!\n<br />🔸\n<br />But don\'t expect premium stuffs on the skewers, they aren\'t expensive ingredients but they\'re still yummy. Will leave it for you to find out, as per you fortune.
Setting my tongue on a slow numbing journey, Birds Of A Feather, a contemporary Sichuan all-day dining spot definitely serves up an intriguing menu and with a beautiful space to boot.
Looking very much like cheng tng with snow fungus and longan, the Poached Pear ($12) was a refreshingly sweet ending perfect for the post-numbness from lunch. Light and gingery with a nice contrast from the citrus peel and orange caramel ice cream, giving a subtle citrusy burst with a slightly bitter aftertaste (not in the bad way though!). Served with a perfectly poached pear that was soft without falling apart easily, this dessert was an interesting take on the traditional dessert with textures and flavour. 
Here is a dish many are flocking to Birds Of A Feather to have: the Oriental Bolognaise ($20++). It\'s a melange of angel hair pasta, tender pork ragout, softened kale and an onsen egg in a truly aromatic sauce.\n<br />The best part is if you can\'t handle spicy food, you can opt to have the non-spicy version. So it\'s still possible to indulge in the heady fragrance of Sichuan flavours without being reduced to a panting, teary-eyed water-guzzler. I think offering customers this choice is clever as some people have avoided Sichuan food due to it being generally too spicy for them.
The modern Szechuan cuisine here has some interesting combinations that I find irresistible. One of which is the \"Roasted Chicken and Avocado Salad with Szechuan Pepper\".\n<br />Expect the creamy avocado and shredded chicken to be extra enticing with an exotic Northern Chinese touch of \"ma la\". I wouldn\'t call this dish spicy but there\'s an edge to it for sure.
Tofu burger with Mapo Meat Sauce has got soft house-made bun sandwiched in MAPO pork ragout, tofu cheese patty and pickled cucumber served in fried potato.
The feisty avian starts off all salty tender popcorn chicken-esque before the exponential numbness of the tongue kicks in from the second bite and the army of peppercorns unleash a meteoric rain of peppery pain. You\'d sweat. 4/5
On a strange roll of having poached pears three times in two days but this is probably the most innovative that I have had — reminds me of the rendition from Empress where they smartly infused Cheng Tng into poached pear but done slightly different here. The elements within the \"Cheng Tng\" were all pretty flavourful and carried a good array of textures such as the soft longans and crunchy, chewy fungus, but what really amazes here is the refreshing Cheng Tng itself and the Orange Caramel ice-cream which was smooth, tastefully bitter and smoky with citrus flavour; the flavour is pretty one of a kind and goes very well with the Cheng Tng as it enhances the flavours overall instead of creating a flavour mess when it melts. The poached pear was also pretty cooling and carries a subtle sweetness while being soft to the bite. Quite the dessert to end off that intense and spicy meal overall.
Not quite as spicy as we thought, but it could also be because my tastebuds were already a little numbed by the spiciness from the previous dish that this just suddenly seemed like it was \"chicken feet\" to handle. I actually pretty like this rendition of Zha Jiang Mian they have here incorporated with pasta — enjoyed the savoury minced meat and sauced laced with the Angel Hair pasta, while the egg helps to create a more silkier texture for the dish when mixed in. Also liked the Parmesan grated atop the veggies for a savoury flavour and the inclusion of dehydrated raspberries for a little bit of tang and wee bit of sweetness that helps to add contrast to the dish.
There weren\'t even joking about finding the chicken here — the entire dish just came with loads of chili and Sichuan peppers it\'s insane. The first few bites were shiok and it subsequently becomes an assault of spicy, slightly numbing flavours that at the same time fragrant without drowning down the flavours of the spices. The garlic helps to add yet another dimension of flavours that occasionally helps with the spiciness — but that is not always guaranteed if they were soaked in the chili oil as well. Very fiery, but fun and shiok as one tries to down some water and tears up in attempts to enjoy it at the same time!
[New Restaurant featured in Burpple Newly Opened Guide Nov 2016] Totally in love with the deco and vibes of this place, where natural light pour through the skylight onto the garden in this cafe.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Pictured here is their iced chocolate caramel latte cubes, allowing you to slow down and enjoy the nature in this cafe as you wait for the coffee cubes to melt in the glass of milk and chocolate caramel. Food here is really good, although some desserts are better than others (will elaborate in subsequent posts).
I\'ve tried 3 out of 4 desserts on their menu (all except the poached pear), and this is the one I recommend.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Crisp pan-fried exterior with a soft chewy rice cake centre that could be easily cut through by the teeth. It isn\'t too sweet, as it\'s drizzled conservatively with Okinawan black sugar syrup before being dusted liberally with soy bean powder for added roasted fragrance.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Now I just need the poached pear to unlock the achievement of trying every dessert here. Soon, I hope!
Fluffy earl grey chiffon is served with milk chocolate foam, yuzu curd and almond nougatine. I always like chiffon cakes for its fluffiness. Both the earl grey fragrance and milk chocolate here is delicate, so some of you might find that it is overpowered by the raspberries. Nevertheless this is overall a light dessert after the spicy and guilty mains.
No surprises here, the mapo tofu is every bit like the Szechuan mapo tofu, with silky tofu and minced pork powered by numbing Szechuan peppers - except that you have a choice to have this with rice or pita bread.. and I chose the latter to bring the Mediterranean into China.
This is my recommended main course here. The patty\'s the most important component of a burger, and this patty was cooked to a medium doneness and breaks down easily so that it\'s soft and juicy, while having a charcoal grilled smokiness on the outside.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Foie gras was rich and creamy without veins, without being too bitter, so those who dislike the acquired taste of foie gras may still like this. Have the patty together with the foie gras, as well as the accompanied cheddar, caramelized onions and lettuce to complete the burger experience.\n<br />🔸\n<br />My qualms? It\'s supposed to be Szechuan fusion but the chilli soy tapenade was so mild that this is just like a pure American burger. The good thing is that those who can\'t take spice may still be able to enjoy this.
This is my recommended starter here. I\'m a huge fan of Szechuan food, and I\'m familiar with Szechuan cuisine having acquainted and dined with several Chinese friends from Szechuan.\n<br />🔸\n<br />No frills, no twists, this is 辣子鸡 (Szechuan fried chicken). But it\'s great, and is every bit like those cooked by Szechuan chefs, albeit less 麻 (numbing) and less spicy. But what impressed me was that even though it\'s crispy, it remained tender and juicy, unlike several Chinese chefs who tend to over fry their chicken. I wish there\'s more to go around!
Feather\'s Coffee ($7.50)
Bird\'s Signature Burger 🍔 ($30)
Spicy Oriental Bolognaise ($22)
Szechuan-Italian fusion at its best. This 炸酱面-inspired dish uses angel hair pasta served with Szechuan chilli.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The chilli is numbing, as with many Szechuan dishes, but without being overly spicy so that you can still taste the flavourful pork ragout sauce. The pasta is well oiled so it\'s smooth, but at any time, break and mix in the sticky onsen tamago to change its texture. This heavy dish is balanced by kale with grated cheese.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This would be one of my recommended main courses here, other than the signature bird burger.
You may not quite imagine this garden meets traditional Chinese teahouse interior restaurant serving Sichuan cuisine AND cocktails, nestled (pardon the pun) at Amoy Street.
This snazzy newcomer on Amoy Street is the perfect place to catch up with friends over cocktails and excellent Sichuan-inspired dishes after a long day. If you\'re swinging by for a celebratory dinner after work, get their perfectly executed Negroni ($25) to relax. Kick off your meal with the spicy Find the Chicken in the Chillies ($16) and the Crispy Gyoza with Truffle Soy Vinaigrette ($16) — both great for sharing. For mains, you must try the Spicy Oriental Bolognaise ($22), their rendition of zha jiang mian made with angel hair pasta, pork ragout, kale and sakura ebi. Cool down your senses and end the meal with the Glutinous Rice Cake ($12), flat strips of chewy rice cake topped with soy powder and Okinawan black sugar. Pro tip: If you don\'t fancy a heavy dinner, come by at lunch to take in the full beauty of the place (there are two sky roofs for natural light to pour in). While you\'re here, get the Grilled Cheese Panini ($20) with braised pork belly, pickled cabbage and fried potatoes that is served only during lunch. \n<br />Avg Price: $50 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayne Tan
Definitely my favourite main after trying most of the dishes at the media tasting! This is one dish I\'d happily come back for, mainly because I\'m a sucker for zhajiangmian and spagbol, so this is perfect. The angel hair gets a slick, lovely coat from the goey egg, and the meat provides a nice Sichuan flavour. Opt for the spicy version, it\'s hardly spicy and very tasty! Mix this well and get all that parm in there.
Suh gud. The truffle is such a treat in the dipping sauce! Get this to share from the Small Plates menu.
Been excited to try this since seeing the other posts on Burpple! The deep fried chicken bites are delightfully tossed in Sichuan peppercorns, dried chilies, leeks and garlic, giving that nice mala sensation without being overpowering. Be sure to start your meal with this!
Which is really what it is. If you can take the challenge of spicy and numbing Sichuan spice mix and dried red 🌶, order this. First bite, aiya nothing lah. Second bite, still ok. Suddenly the receptors on your tongue experience the chemesthesis sensation. Oh oh, numbing occurs coz of the Sichuan peppercorns, capsaicin from the Chilli joins in the fun. You get the high and indulge more ignoring the beads of sweat that forms on your forehead and scalp. Sadistic. Satisfying. Maybe it only occurs to me.
Why? Heard the chefs here are from 2 backgrounds. One Sichuan food expert. The other was from an Italian place. So the panini combines the best of both worlds. The panini bread is nicely crisp and toasted with the melty cheese that blends rather well with the Chinese style braised pork belly and the crunchy pickles. Their 9th day of official opening and all they are picking up speed and taste. Not to mention this place is gorgeous! Bringing the Wife here soon!
The Salmon 2 Ways ($26) was presented to us with dramatic flair, as dry ice engulfed a glass bowl of salmon tartare, apple granité with of Sichuan pepper and ikura. Mix everything together for a refreshing citrus-y palate cleanser!!

What you see here is like a deconstructed mooncake. Called \"The Golden Moon\". Concocted just for the mid-autumn festival. There are so many elements in this one plate. Here goes. The round disc is a replica of the traditional mooncake skin. Not crispy like a biscuit, texture is the same as the mooncake. The two cream dollops are lotus paste espuma flanked by cranberries. Alittle twist. Salted egg cream sandwiched in between choux puff. Garnished with crunchy five grains. It is sweet. Alittle saltyness from the not so overwhelming salted egg cream.\n<br />◽◾\n<br />Dont look like mooncake but the taste transports you to the mid-autumn festival. Only available till 7th October.
Fortune skewers with lotus root, quail eggs, broccoli etc. The broth was a little sichuan, alittle spicy, alittle tangy but  whole lot addictive. A very soothing and comforting bowl especially on rainy days or when you need a perk me up.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />I had this when I was feeling abit under the weather and had no appetite. The broth really did wonders to wake up my appetite and had a calming effect. Yes... it is good, at least for me.
This is worth every calory. Fried to perfection, have this on its own or with the Okinawa black sugar syrup for a sweet touch.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#igsg #igsingapore #sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #exploresingapore  #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #foodetection #foodinsing #wishuponatart_eats #sichuan #okinawa
This is the \"Fortune Skewers\" - drenched in mildly spicy mala soup are sticks of prawns, broccoli, cauliflower, lotus root etc.
Another one of his personal make. Hint hint ... it is fizzy. It is caffeinated. Slightly bitter with a hint of acidity. No sugar. No syrup. But quite refreshing.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />I am so honored that whenever I visit, there is always a surprise that lands on my table.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Thank you @vincentyong1107 @birdsofafeathersg much 💕 for the heartfelt warmth and hospitality.
This is like dessert and coffee in a mug. Sweet sweet torched meringue over black robust coffee with a nutty finish.
Only popped by for a cuppa but ended having a cake too.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Relatively new dessert item, this is a Jasmine Tea cake. Light sponge with light cream and little bits of black sesame seeds imbedded in the centre. Garnished with my favorite berries and tiny drops of berries coulis. On top, the dehydrated kiwi slices were just yummy. It is pillowy soft like a marshmallow but not sticky. Smooth with sweet, tangy, zesty tones with a hint of jasmine tea. A delicate finish for the sagacious palate.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Pretty plating as always. Thank you @vincentyong1107 for the sweet treat. Always happy to see you.
I like!
It is just fluffy rice surrounded by kale which by the way a rich source of antioxidants. Hot &amp; sour broth poured over the seabass. A mild spicyness with a invigorating scintillating drooling mouthfeel. Salted veges by the side.. if one decides to up the sourish ante which I did by the way. ◾◾\n<br />It is named Hot and Sour Chazuke. I call it my \"Feel Good\" dish because it looks ordinary but the broth made it extraordinary. A flavorsome and comforting dish. I ❤ it.
The coffee brownies is topped with Tahitian vanilla Chantilly with a candy cloud surrounding it. On the base is coffee soil.

The savory version of the Fried Glutinous Rice Cake ($12) is sprinkled with spicy soy seasoning, pistachio sand, red sugar caramel and pomegranate. The combination definitely has elevated the whole experience.

The crunchy pig ear is braised in Sichuan braising liquid and served cold with housemade Sichuan red and sour dressing and arrowroot noodle. Its definitely not for the fate hearted with a low tolerant of spicy food. On the hand, the cold and spicy combination has a refreshing finish on top of the spicy kick.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #pigear
Salmon two ways.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />A cold dish. Salmon tartare, apple granite with a hint of sichuan pepper and ikura. Cured confit salmon, japanese sweet potato, lychee and bell pepper coulis. Quite a mouthful of ingredients. Tartare was tangy with a tinge of heat. Icy cold granite helps to reduce the \"fishyness\" as tartare tends to be overwhelming. Cured salmon was a little intense for my tastebuds but do love the crispy purple sweet potato. My advice.. eat the sweet potato and salmon in one mouthful for a more balanced explosion of strong flavors.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Nice touch to \"dry ice\".. creating a cloud nine effect.
#throwback pic.\n<br />.
Will definitely be back for their lunch/ dinner menu next 😬
One of them is Big Bird 1st ($25) which is like your big breakfast. It consists of 2 poached egg resting on Englsh muffin, dressed in Mala hollandaise sauce, bacon, sausage and salad. This is a hearty plate but I would like to have more heat in the hollandaise sauce to get that mala kick.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #brunch

New dish at @birdsofafeathersg
One of few newly created desserts, the Goodwood Coffee as it is aptly named, promises to woo the caffeine lovers.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />A coffee brownie topped with Tahitian vanilla chantilly, was surrounded with a very white candy cloud. Sorry peeps, it melted as a shot of espresso was poured over. Well... it was just too pristine white and clouded the brownie which to me was the star. I am sure in the days to come, there will be posts of the white \"cloud\". Now the brownie lies on a bed of coffee soil in a pool of coffee. It is bitter even with the chantilly and dissolved candy. I loved the bittersweet flavors. This is a 2 in 1 on a plate. Dessert and coffee which saves you time to go hunting for a cup of coffee. Beans are sourced from China and blended inhouse. ◾◾\n<br />If you are not a super sweettoother,  appreciate bitterness, and a coffeeholic, this one is for you! I certainly will go back to savor the brand new mains.\n<br />Shout out to @superfinefeline @keropokman it was nice seeing you.
One of the new brunch item Bird\'s Skillet ($23) which is vibrantly presented. The colorful dish comprises of spicy chorizo, bacon, roasted baby potato, camembert, cheddar, two eggs and pickled red chilli tomato sauce. A dish with multi experience in terms of flavours and textures.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #brunch

#MediaTasting
Most of the dish were very salty.
A whiff of it triggered the \"salivating\" sensory. It is hard not to drool . 🔸🔸\n<br />The first bite was a fiery explosion on the palate. Pop pop pop into the mouth and I can\'t stop popping. It is salty. It is spicy. Second bite, the spicyness was manageable. Third bite, so used to the heat. After which it became so addictive. 🔸🔸\n<br />A great dish to devour. A great spicy dish to drown my bad moods. A great dish to share with people I like.
◾◾\n<br />One look and it bears a resemblance to a cappucino... you know with the foam on top and the coffee cup. My drink is actually a mocktail concocted by @vincentyong1107 . Not on the menu. His concoction is based on his own impression of the drinker.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />I know what is in it. All I can say it was a tad tangy, not too sweet and creamy. A cooling and refreshing finish. I am impressed as these are the flavors that I liked and I did not even tell him. So his impression of me was almost on point. ◾◾\n<br />I was expecting a tall glass. Again, I was wowed by the coffee cup and the added plating of flowers and mint to create that feminine touch. ◾◾\n<br />Thank you, Vincent @birdsofafeathersg for this special mocktail. I truly respect you who takes pride in your work. Thank you for sharing your journey with me. For this special drink... I would call it \"A Cup of Cool Passion\". #mocktail #bartenders #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfollowers #sgig #sgfoodies #burpple #instafollowers #instagramaddict #igfollowers #instafoodsg #citynomads #birdsofafeathersg #tpasg #tpasg

For the longest time, I had wanted to eat this. Hot &amp; Sour Chazuke. Now \"chazuke\" is a japanese dish made by pouring hot soup or tea over cooked rice.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />In this version, this is a light and mild spicy pickled mustard broth gently poured over Niigata rice and a charcoal grilled barramundi. By the side are extra condiments of kiam chye (salted veg) and coriander. The skin of barramundi is crisp whilst the outer flesh was crisp golden brown, white interior, tender and moist. Crispy kale and grilled tomato slices flanked by the sides. A very scintillating and tantalising broth that playfully teases the palate. It is sour, tangy and a little spicy heat that tones down the \"twang\" of the broth.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />As I am just recovering from flu and with little appetite, this was like my life saver. It gave my tastebuds a wake up call. Because of the tangyness, it improved my appetite and in no time,  I was thoroughly enjoying every slurp. A very comforting dish indeed and a dish that I would not get sick of. ◾◾\n<br />Service was impeccable. Thank you @vincentyong1107 @birdsofafeathersg for always reserving my usual table. Always happy to see you. Thank you to the service guy (sorry... i forgot to ask for your name), for being so warm and friendly.

Hot &amp; Sour Chazuke (S$28) served with Niigata rice and a spicy pickled mustard green broth, charcoal-grilled barramundi and mentaiko. \n<br />Flavours reminded me of my AhMa\'s 咸菜汤 with a way spicer kick, more atas ingredients as well as price point. 😂
Braised pork belly, pickled cabbage and fried potato

Doesn\'t taste bad but not recommended. 重點是下面的文字，圖文不符的時間又來嘍。#慧思敏語\n<br />▪\n<br />#暗戀桃花源 #暗恋桃花源 \n<br />在元宵節的那天，我走進了屬於我的桃花源。《暗戀桃花源》，在取劇名時，演員跟導演抗議。因為這名字不合文法。兩部看起來毫無關係的戲，竟然可以如此結合。喜劇與悲劇竟然可以同台，帶給觀眾笑聲和淚水。到頭來也發現到喜劇不過是寓悲于喜。
It was mediocre and overpriced in my opinion, would go back for the 辣子雞, Spicy Oriental Bolognaise and the Choco Caramel Cube Latte! 😍
When the west meets the east..
Well-recommended dessert which I\'ll go back for. \n<br />#pretty #dessert #tgif #amoystreet #sgig #igsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #goodvibes #throwback #latergram #onthetable #hungrygowhere #burpple #8dayseatout #foodvsco #vscocam #happiness #birdsofafeather

My iced chocolate caramel with espresso cubes pales in comparison. But looks can be deceiving. In that willowy slim glass, espresso cubes melts and transforms to a dark and robust beverage. Looked pale and forlorn but tasted strong and roasty.

These were accompanied with assorted fried potatoes that were so addictive, we almost started a fight 🙊
The deep fried glutinous rice cake is drizzled with Okinawan black sugar syrup and topped with peanut. in my own layman term, it felt like eating peanut candy.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg
Pairing cheese with tofu and frying them \'katsu\' style to become a breaded and crumbly patty and then drenching it in mapo (spicy and numb) meat sauce. Embrace the patty with house made soft and pillowy white bun that will absorb the essence of the sauce and then serve it with some greens. And tada you have reinvented the 麻婆豆腐 dish!

Basically it is burnt meringue on top of white coffee.

It has both the non spicy and spicy version. Add $2 for the spicy version. The angel hair pasta comes with pork ragout, onsen tamago, wilted kale and sakura ebi.

🔸🔸\n<br />An afternoon cocktail with a mix of passionfruit, lychees and white rum. Quite an apt drink to accompany the pig trotter (not in pix😏). 🔸🔸\n<br />It had been a fun afternoon out with the gals, something we rarely do on a weekday.
🔼🔼\n<br />To be called the Feathers cheesecake defined it as one of their signatures. It is nice, not overpowering cheesy.  But what was missing was the berry compote (sold out during lunch). I could not hide my disappointment cos my personal preference would be the compote over the chantilly cream. The compote would have given the cake the hint of acidity and the tangy finish. 🔼🔼\n<br />But we did finish the cake with our coffees and plenty of conversation. However, I am happy with the attentive service from Vincent @birdsofafeathersg who was nice to sit down and chat with us. Thank you @vincentyong1107 for being so sweet whenever I visit.
This is one of my favourite dishes. A spicy pickled mustard green broth is poured into the bowl of Niigata rice with charcoal grilled barramundi and mentaiko. Mixed them together and eat it like a porridge. The salt and spicy broth is the star of the dish, bringing all the elements together for a hearty and comforting enjoyment.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #birdsofafeather
Crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Heavy sprinkling of soya bean powder and drizzled with Okinawa black sugar syrup.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Think muah chee, almost similar but minus the crispyness. ◾◾\n<br />A potentially regular hang out place for me, myself and I where I can enjoy eating, drinking coffee, writing and chilling.
It also have your usual western fare but maybe with a little twist. The Roasted Chicken &amp; Avocado Salad with Szechuan Pepper ($20) is one of the non spicy items on the menu. It comes on a bed of mixed greens and dressed in lemon juice.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #avocado #salad #birdsofafeathersg
What appears to be normal chicken broth turns out to be the standout dish for the night when it comes to the level of spiciness. The first spoonful was delectable while there was a tinge of numbness when you go for the second but once you hit the third, you will get this sensation that this is not for the faint hearted. \n<br />The assortment of vegetables and seafood etc at the end of each skewer is like a fortune cookie. You do not know what you gona get..\n<br />Will definitely come back again for their scrumptious and creative items and the oh so cozy sofa seats
It has a picante (very spicy) lingering finish which torments your palate to be addicted. So droolworthy!!\n<br />🔸🔹\n<br />\"Find the chicken in the chillies\" at #amoystreetblocparty on Nov 19 from 3 to 10pm.
Crispy, succulent and super spicy. It has all the elements that made me love this staple Sichuan dish.

Like shaker fries, the special Sichuan spice is poured into the bag and given a good shake to coat the succulent and crispy deep fried pork trotter.

Diners also have a choice of fried potato or greens for the side. The interpretation of the classic hamburger if not on par, is as good as many burger joints out there, giving a fresh twist to the tradition.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #birdsofafeathersg #mapo #burger

And all these is done with a dash of western influence in its presentation.\n<br />For those with a low tolerance of spiciness, you will find the crispy and tender chicken completely engulfed by the flavour of the aggressive Sichuan ingredients who are out to bring numbness to your tastebuds.
You never know what ingredient is at the end of the skewer until you pull it out from the mala broth. I managed to get quail egg, potato, lotus root and black fungus. You can even choose to add some silky smooth Japanese Arrowroot Noodle ($5) to make it a meal itself.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #birdsofafeathersg

A somewhat similarity to hot cheng tng that was transformed to a cold refreshing dessert.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Sweet with a slight ginger hint. The best element was the soft tender pear ... poached perrrr..fectly. However, the orange caramel ice cream was atad sweet for me. But those who need a fix of various flavors at one go will enjoy this \"perk me up\" after a heavy meal.
@coolheart attempting to snap a perfect pic with @justinfoodprints as the handmodel. Me was just being at my mischievious self.
Oh my gyoza!! Feast your eyes on the charred skin.  Scintillating &amp; beckoning!! ◾◾\n<br />Crisp on one side and alittle soft on the other. Teasing one\'s palate. Dip dip dip in that dark brown twangy sauce that was mixed with chilli oil.  The acidity cuts thru the grease and tones down the jelakness.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Amazing color that make you drool.
Sip the sweetness then slurp the bitter. \n<br />So we flocked together over this \"Feather\'s Coffee\" . An espresso based with meringue as its crowning glory. Quite a nice perk me up as you get your sugar and caffeine fix at the same time. \n<br />#coffeetime #coffeegram #thingsaboutcoffee #allthingscoffee #meringue #hungrygowhere #stfoodtrending #burpplemessyeats #burpple #8dayseat #sgbloggers #sgig #sgfoodies #tripadvisor #narratrs #instafollow #eatbooksg #eatliststar #citynomads #birdsofafeathersg #cafesg
Angel hair pasta with pork ragout, sakura ebi, wilted kale and a runny onsen tamago. 🔸🔹\n<br />An oriental twist to pasta. The seasoning which was a pleasant mix of sweet, citrussy and a tinge of sichuan heat, left a very tantalising addictive finish on one\'s palate. Loved the wilted kale as it gave the dish a boost of crispy textures.\n<br />🔹🔸\n<br />My favorite among the dishes we had today. So memorable that I know we will be back for more.\n<br />Thank you @justinfoodprints for always being our handmodel.
You know, cast iron has excellent heat retention?? Oops... alittle sidetracked. The mapo tofu has plenty of spicy heat which I liked. For me it was manageable. Those who cannot take spicy, do have a glass of water on standby.\n<br />◾◾ Presentation in cast iron always make me go wild cos it is one of my fave \"instrument\" to use in my cooking. On another heartfelt note... the company was awesome. I also made 4 new lady friends at a separate table. They were so kind to let us have their table due to the natural lighting coming from up above. Thank you dear ladies!!\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Shout out to Vincent @birdsofafeathersg .. thank you for the great service and the complimentary coffees. Please pass my thanks to the four ladies.
