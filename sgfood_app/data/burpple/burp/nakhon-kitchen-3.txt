Nakhon\'s Kitchen is always a place to go for a huh-hah meal with friends and family. Despite the intimidating queue, they have a good deal of classic Thai dishes without exploiting my wallet. My favourite would be their vermicelli salad and prawn tom yum (thick base). Both have the tangy spicy kick to satisfy my tastebuds. Aroi Mak Mak!
Trying this out of randomness. The dish was heavily on the salty side so please have some rice with it. I was hoping for more mussels in my curry but it was a great dish on a whole especially with the generous amount of sweet cubes of pineapple. And nope, not as spicy as the name may suggest.
Even though the store official open at noon, you can see people waiting outside and the tables are quickly snatched up in 10min. As always we order a wide spread for two: Thai Fish Cake ($6), Papaya Salad ($5), Stir-fried Chicken with Cashew Nuts ($6), Stir-fried Mixed Vegetables ($6) and Phad Thai Noodles ($5). The array of food which are cheap and good, will make us keep going back for more...
we order pad thai, kang kong, sweet n\' sour chicken and clear tom yum soup plus Thai iced tea. Everything was damn good except the kang kong was too spicy :(
They have quite a good variety of food, and dishes are in smaller portions! It\'s affordable and smaller portions means you get to mix and match and try more food! This table was good for 3 people, and we didn\'t even feel very full! Maybe it\'s because the food is so nice? 
$6 for tomyam ; $6 for green curry ; $3 for thai-milk tea (each) and $5 mango sticky rice. Food is great with wonderful customer service. It\'s very authentic and pocket friendly too! 
I can\'t believe I\'m saying this but I love the green curry here! But still, my all-time favourite is the pandan leaf chicken: egg and chicken wrapped in the pandan leaf and grilled to perfection.
Cheap and affordable thai food,the best dish will be tom yum soup and olive rice.The total price cost $31 and prices are nett here.The dishes are served quickly so it should be prepared beforehand however since its cheap its definitely worth to try
From the east to the (almost) west! Inexpensive and famous Thai food from the East of Singspore. Note: Queue may get slightly long during peak hours but it seems to move rather fast ‚úåÔ∏è
If you\'re looking for some simple and yummy Thai food, Nakhon is the place. The dishes here boast their fresh and homey taste. Although the pad thai is a bit too sweet for my liking, it\'s definitely one of the best around. 
This bowl of tom yum noodle isn\'t spicy (I guess?). Generous portion of seafood and noodles, accompanied by authentic flavours.
This sticky mango rice may not be the best. There\'s not much sticky rice, and the mango isn\'t really sweet. Idk why but the warmness of it seems to atone for my sins.
Nakhon outlets are suddenly sprouting everywhere! Not that I\'m complaining, cheap and good Thai food always make me happy. This whole table of food cost just less than 60, including the awesome Thai iced milk tea.
Tom yum, Green curry, Pad Thai. Enough to satisfy all Thai cravings. ($30 for 2 pax)
Nakhon serves portions just nice for one. Anyway is it me or is the weather getting more hot and humid these days?
Another hidden gem offering affordable Thai food! Here we have tom yam seafood, minced beef with basil leaves, and green curry chicken. Everything had the right amount of Thai element in it, yet wasn\'t too spicy! The staffs weren\'t exactly very friendly, but they did their job sufficiently so who cares. üòÇ
First time at Nahkon\'s (no queue at all‚úåÔ∏è) - fav basil pork rice, clear tomyum seafood soup and kangkongüåøüêôüêüüçö #nakhonkitchen
Only the tom yam soup was as delicious. The mango sticky rice had a way smaller slice of mango on top and the red ruby featured here had very little water chestnut. I read that the fishcakes were a must try but they were only ok. How can standards fluctuate so much in two days?
Simple and classy in it\'s presentation and the rice is served warm. Love it when restaurants make the effort to heat up the rice.
For just $5 this is a fantastic portion and it tastes great. Definitely flavourful with an aftertaste of roasted coconut.
Gotta find time to eat Thai food soon ü§ó\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #padthai #burpple #nakhon #thaifood #asianfood #sgculinary #sgrestaurant #hollandvillage #sgfoodies #instafoodies #foodies #foodstagram #instafood #foodgasm #eatgasm #foodphoto #dinner #hungry

#spicelovers, the tomyum soup has a real kick. üå∂
The restaurant was busy and packed, we queued up and they gave us an umbrella for the sun &amp; menus to look at. Then they served us cold water in plastic cups &amp; took our order whilst we were waiting. This meant when we got our table food was served quickly. \n<br />We ordered pandan chicken, Thai fish cakes, Tom yum clear soup with seafood &amp; Pad Thai ($23.50 in total). Big portions, great tasting food &amp; not expensive. Refills of water free. \n<br />Amazing service, good food, with no service charge! :) Worth the wait.
Omg it is so spicyyy
one of the best green curry i ever tasted. majority of the food is spicy but very shiok. prices are relatively cheap but for me the portions are quite small. will def come back there!
Must order
Must order ÔºÅ
Most satisfying Thai food in Singapore and don\'t forget is cheap!

There are several choices here, clear/thick base soup or with coconut milk, chicken/shrimps/seafood. And if I\'m not wrong, it\'s just 6 dollars! \n<br />Do note, short staff, long wait and not so nice dining ambience. But food and price is good enough for me to go back !!! #tomyam #tomyamsoup #authenticthai #thaifood #nakhonthai #nakhonkitchen  #hollandvillage #sgfoodie #burpple #sgfoodporn #foodspotting #foodstagram #nomnom #seafoodsoup #hungrygowhere
Affordable but really long waiting queue. This noodle however doesn\'t appeal to me cuz of a weird taste of oil which I can\'t fathom what it is. \n<br />#padthai #thaifood #nakhonthai #nakhonkitchen #hollandvillage #sgfoodie #burpple #padthainoodles #foodspotting #foodstagram #nomnom #sgig #foodspotting #foodstagram #foodiesg #sgfood #foodpornsg
üòÇ We came at 8 pm and waited for about 30 mins to be seated because the queu was crazy! Be prepared!\n<br />Good food with affordable price, ranging from $6 to $12. For oatmeal prawns, they are so generous giving so much oatmeal. üòÇ Tom yam soup is good! The soup is strong and fresh. If you are a spicy lover, give kang kong Thai style a try! You\'ll love it.\n<br />These are worth your money and time.\n<br />-------------------------------------------------\n<br />Nakhon Kitchen\n<br />Address: 27A Lorong Liput Holland Village
There\'s something comforting about Asian flavors that always makes you feel at home.
great Thai food at a super affordable price!!

At $5 it\'s quite a steal but it\'s just too wet, not how it should have been

Sawadeekaa! Affordable Thai food nearby my vicinity! So much food ordered but it was just $37 bucks! üòç mega love the stirred fried beef with basil leaves ($8) and also the pineapple fried rice ($6). The punch of spice was worth it! 
So good! üëç #missingbkk

Finally got to try this thai food after talking so long abt it from @shermaiine hao giao siao~ the tomyum soup &amp; green curry are their must try!! Worth the q-ing! Portion kinda small but its cheaper than other places. \n<br />#latergram #food #foodporn #thaifood #sgfood #dinner #greencurry #tomyumsoup #basilleaveschicken #kangkong #garlicprawns #mincedporkwithtofu #nahkonkitchen #hollandvillage #lorongmambong #burpplesg #burpple
Their tom yum and chicken wrapped in pandan leaves won my votes. I guess that explains why the queue is always so long. #delishfoodlovers #foodporn #sgfood #burpple #ilovesharingfood #sgfoodporn #vscocamsg #vscocam  #whatiate #throwback
üëç not too sweet, not too spicy either ! #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #thai #fatdieme #iconosquare
the only downside to this place is you have to be a willing food nazi.
Comfort food on a Saturday üôÜüèº
Decent and affordable quick meal, but not one of the better Thai eateries.
Everything is delish, cheap &amp; good! All these only $49 plus 2 drinks. #foodie #thai #tomyum #seafood #yummy #foodstagram #instafood #singapore #burpple
One of the better ones around, imo. #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #burpple #nakhon
It\'s always good to have friends who have the same favourites as you. As in my case, it\'s always Thai food. Besides, Nakhon is within close proximity from NUS since they opened a new branch in Holland Village early this year. With the good Thai food they serve and the kind of price they offer, this is the place we always go to when we crave for Thai food.
Brb while I nurture my food baby
So happy to have it so near me! #whosaysgoodfoodonlyineast
Can\'t live my life without Asian food. Especially Thai food!! The flavorful taste of the cuisine with the burst of zest is what makes me keep going back to having good Thai food. (Also amazing how it\'s now opened at Holland Village with no GST/SERVICE charge for dining)
