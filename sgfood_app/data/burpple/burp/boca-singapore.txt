Always a fan of Portuguese style egg tarts for that flaky buttery pastry crust and this did not disappoint with the creamy egg custard filling ‚Äî completed with some cinnamon and lemon zest!
Pasteis de bacalhau ‚Äî cod fish fritters made with cured cod fish, potato, onions, parsley and a side of tartar on the side.  \n<br />The filling was moist, well seasoned and fried to a nice fragrant golden brown. It looked unassuming on first sight but the smell and taste eventually got us nodding in approval. 
Never imagined the interior of Boca to look so gorgeous. The ambience here is so on point, it\'s a perfect setting for a cosy gathering. And of course, the food here will not disappoint. 
very quickly escalated into a fabulous dining experience. @juliuslim and I were just about to go home when we decided to pop into Boca for some egg tart, which was pretty much the best desserts I\'ve had in a while. \n<br />The fluffy egg custard was accentuated with lemon zest and cinnamon, elevating the dish from an innocent snack to a worthy dessert. We also loved the buttery pastry, which did not at all overshadow the oh-so-creamy insides. \n<br />It\'s so good, we\'re going back for more tomorrow (with friends of course!!)
We got to try a little Port last night and it turns out to be really awesome. Essentially red wine with brandy, Port has a smooth texture and sweet flavour. It goes down real easily, despite having a 19% alcohol content. Warning: take a conscious effort to drink in moderation. You might KO before you realize. 
Authentic Portuguese Egg Tarts. At $6 a pop, these may sound fancifully expensive but I guess these are things that you should try probably once in your life. Served hot in the middle, the egg curd is really smooth and jiggly without feeling anywhere jelly-like with a hint of cinnamon running within. Encased within a flaky crust pastry, the well-balanced crispness, sweetness and that luscious egg curd makes this a delightful treat to end the meal with.
Octopus leg, paprika, garlic chips, spinach, baked potato, kalamata olives, extra virgin olive oil. One of the dishes I would seriously recommend you to try if you ever head to Boca. Have no idea how they did it, but the texture to how the octopus leg is just so spot on! There was never a moment it felt too chewy nor mushy; the larger parts literally cuts with ease when you start chewing without starting a fight with your muscles and teeth, it\'s so amazing. The ends of the leg was also said to be pretty crisp as well. Definitely a dish that I have enjoyed immensely at the table.
7 oz tenderloin, coffee cognac cream sauce, almond rice. Yet another dish that I would strongly recommend, though it might come a little pricey. The tenderloin was cooked to medium-rare perfection, having a pinkish centre that carried quite a bite. Coffee cognac cream wasn\'t particularly strong on the coffee aspect, and especially with the juices of the need seeping into the sauce, some might find the sauce rather salty. Mop the sauce all up with the almond rice; the rice was cooked without feeling too hard not too soggy, accompanied with almond flakes all over for a hint of nutty flavour. There is no way I can describe the flavour when the rice absorbs that umami goodness, but not only did I wiped the pan of rice clean (when I am not one who likes to pile up on carbs), the remaining portion of rice was dumped into the plate of beef to soak up almost every drop of sauce left on the plate. If that still doesn\'t mean anything to you, I don\'t know what will.
12 hours slow-cooked pork cheek, mashed potatoes with parsley and ham. While the savoury flavours worked out well and the pork cheeks were well-flavoured from the gravy as well, the pork cheeks here seemed to lay a bit more to the leaner side, which somehow had led to a slightly dry texture. Mashed potatoes were decent, seasoned and flavoured with a good mix of coriander and ham to provide a savoury flavour.
Clams, garlic, coriander, white wine, extra virgin olive oil. Served with four slices of bread with garlic butter, soak them up with the flavourful white wine broth that carried strong hints of garlic without overwhelming the white wine base to taste the broth at its best. Clams were fresh, but I like it for how the coriander added yet another dimension of flavour to this dish unlike most I have tried which lacks of greens.
Traditional Sweet Potato Bread with Garlic Butter. A rather dense bread that is spread with a savoury and garlicky butter. It is said that they do serve two variants of these depending on the sweet potatoes supplied; an orange version which is the one shown above, and a more normal looking version made from yellow sweet potatoes. This one felt pretty lacking of the sweet potato\'s flavour, though it\'s still quite a good dish to order if you need some bread to mop up the gravy off the more saucey dishes.
Cured cod fish, potatoes, onions, parsley, tartar sauce. A Spanish classic, the flesh of the cod is shredded and mixed with potatoes and onions before frying into a fritter form. Despite the long duration of photo-taking, the crust retained its crispness, carrying a hint of parsley sprinkled over the top. Even with the amount of potato within, one could taste the freshness of the cod within, with a little hint of saltiness for better flavour. Don\'t forget to dip them in the tartar sauce for maximum enjoyment.
This is a must-try as chefs only produce limited quantity per day, and this is probably the only place you can get it in Singapore! Read more about this authentic Portuguese restaurant on our blog!
This is saut√©ed beef cubes, wild mushrooms with sweet potatoes. Very tender and tasty beef. 
This porridge is actually made of bread with shrimps, extra virgin olive oil, fish stock and coriander. Very tasty for a \"porridge\". 
These precious babies come out in batches of 25 a day! And it\'s little wonder why they sell out. Freshly baked with cinnamon and icing sugar! Super yummy!
Had this lovely Portuguese dinner which is a rare find in SG, teasing you with one of their signatures Coffee Steak covered in creamy coffee sauce paired with aromatic almond rice!
And most importantly, I had 2 pieces of this [Authentic Portuguese Egg Tart S$4.50]! These are totally different from all those Portuguese egg tarts out there. üòçüòç The creamy egg custard is baked in flaky puff pastry then finished off in the broiler to achieve the charred surface, then dusted with cinnamon and icing sugar. Limited quantities (like 20+ pieces) freshly baked daily. #YouAreMyEcstacy
These authentic Portuguese egg tarts appearing on my feed for the 264895th time because they deserve that many encores.
A very finely chopped codfish with olive. It actually tasted like fried rice with crab meat. Really nice 
Fresh and tasty clams well done in sour sauce. Very delicious. 
üç∏üç∞üç∑ Grab your friends now and reserve a table @BOCAsingapore because you won\'t want to miss these beautiful sweet treats!üòç Left: chocolate mousse, hazelnut praline \n<br />Right: vanilla custard, egg white \'clouds\' in caramel. \n<br />Of course, not forgetting some authentic Portuguese wines as well. Cheers~ üç∑
Any egg whore that love eggs in any way, shape or form should really take advantage of these limited and authentic Portuguese egg tarts which appear simple looking, but definitely one of the best I tasted.
Australian tenderloin grilled a juicy medium-rare and doused in a smooth, aromatic sauce of espresso, cognac and cream. A side of almond rice, redolent with butter and sliced almonds, accompanies the steak. My love for this dish grows more with every encounter.
Now this is really Portuguese egg tart. Crispy on the outside and smooth and creamy inside. Yummidelicious!
This little Portuguese restaurant serves very tasty meals. This is the first time I\'ve eaten an octopus leg or tentacle that\'s tender and tasty. Really well done. 
First brush with homely #Portuguese fare. Delightful, but I think we over ordered for two of us. Portions for carb dishes were really generous.
What lies beneath the floating island is a light egg white quenelle cloud sitting atop lightly sweetened vanilla custard dusted with cinnamon, layered with passion fruit coulis and fragrant shredded basil.
So looking forward to dinner tomorrow because I know I\'ll get to sink my teeth into one of these bee-yoo-tee-fool eggy tarts at the end of the meal. Teehee.
This is my first time tasting authentic Portuguese cuisine, the one I had in Macau previously wasn\'t even worthy a mention.
Seems pricey at $4.50 a pop, but there are so many reasons why I\'d gladly pay for this precious baby any time.
Impromptu dinner date with @ccher and her lovely mommy, who refused to let me pay for my food.
Last night\'s supper for one.
Tastes like comforting rice porridge, but with random soft bread crust bits and the occasional whiff of fermentation which tease that you aren\'t eating rice. The cod was fresh and chewy, but this Portuguese porridge does skate dangerously on the over-salty line, although it thankfully remains within OB markers. 3.8/5       
The sudden, erratic rainy weather is making me crave this homely Portuguese bread porridge.
Essentially a dessert consisting of a foamy marshmallow relaxing in a pool of smooth, eggy custard with a massive spider-spun caramel golden sugar web serving as a luxurious canopy, although the disgruntled spider leaves some sweet, burnt, crackling droppings which will eventually weigh down the web and cause it to sink into the pool. 4/5
Or you can just call it a Potuguese Floating Island.
Opening along Bukit Pasoh Road, Boca serves authentic Portugese fare in a warm, stylish setting. Be welcomed into the three-storey shophouse by flights of Andorinha (swallows) which commemorate the spirit of returning home, and make yourself comfrotable in this stylish, warm space. Order the Prato de Salgadinhos Mistos, which is their platter of petiscos (the Portugese equivalent of tapas) and go for the super-comforting A√ßorda de Bacalhau (congee-esque bread with salted cod), and the Chouri√ßo em Chamas (chorizo flame-grilled in brandy). End the evening with the original Portuguese Egg Tart, served with a liberal sprinkling of cinnamon and icing sugar as they should be. Sounds like an amazing date night, no?
Rich but not cloying, this elegant chocolate treat spells ultimate indulgence in the form of a lush mousse adorned with homemade hazelnut brittle ‚Äì this latter is just superb and by no means a \"by the way\" ornament. In fact, even the gooseberries are far from \"by the way\" as well, as their acidity aid in lifting the intensity of the chocolate.
Every dish is a labour of love at @bocasingapore and these baked treats are no exception. Sugar and water are first simmered with warm milk, egg yolks and vanilla beans to get a thick custard, then poured into cups of homemade puff pastry and placed right under the broiler to get a burnished top and rich caramelised flavour. In Portugal, egg tarts are eaten with a liberal sprinkling of cinnamon and icing sugar, so that\'s exactly what you\'ll get here, too. \n<br />You\'ll also find these Portuguese egg tarts are quite unlike any other you\'ve tasted ‚Äì none of that Macau blasphemy! (I kid, they\'re delicious in their own way.) Boca\'s gems are much denser and creamier, with the light, crisp and flaky puff pastry shells providing a beautiful contrast in texture.
Similar to a risotto, this Portuguese dish has short-grain rice fried in olive oil to remove the glutens in it, then mixed with red wine and octopus broth, fresh tomatoes and homemade peri-peri sauce (made with jalape√±os, chilli peppers, olive oil and garlic). Adorning the pool of al dente rice are chunks of tender boiled octopus and a small wad of cilantro leaves, this latter I find very useful in cutting through the rich flavour of the stock.
Everything on the menu at Singapore\'s first Portuguese restaurant, @bocasingapore is authentic, right down to these fresh Portuguese breads lovingly hand-kneaded and baked daily in-house. You can expect three different varieties each day (depending on what Chef feels like making), served with a remarkably flavourful pressed olive oil.
Potatoes sliced ultra-finely with a mandolin to resemble hay, then confit and mixed with boiled bacalhau (Portuguese salt cod), caramelised onions, and egg.
On a rainy day like this, I wish I could tuck into a steamy pot of this comforting Portuguese \"porridge\". It looks like rice, but it\'s actually made of homemade BREAD.
Essentially a platter of petiscos (Portuguese equivalent of tapas), this sampler of authentic Portuguese small bites comprises bacalhau pasteis (salt cod pastries), shrimp rissois (fried Portuguese dumplings), beef and chorizo croquetes, and chicken empadinhas (mini Portuguese pies). The bacalhau filling is my favourite, but the pastry of the rissois stands out most; the homemade pastry dough is passed through a pasta roller so it achieves an uber-thin texture that complements, rather than overwhelms, its sweet shrimp stuffing.

Just fresh out from the oven, it was flaky, warm, runny, eggy and creamy. Authentic portuguese egg tarts that was not over custardy. Had many a tart the last few weeks, this by far was my favorite. \n<br />Limited quantities are made every morning. But if you require more pieces, the owner advised to call the restaurant to make advance orders.üòÑ Cost per piece is $4.50++.

This tantalizing protein farm is so tasty, and the texture is so so unique, you will literally beg for more. Accompanied with roasted potatoes and greens. Other things to try are the white wine clams and egg&amp;chorizo!
We are so lucky to try these precious ones because they are baked at a limited number of 20 tarts per day! üòç #oneisnotenough Come @BOCASingapore to try for yourself!üòã
AcÃßorda is a bread-based casserole and at BOCA, the chefs age their homemade bread for two days before immersing it in bacalhau or shrimp stock for a more intense flavour. It is then transferred into a pot, simmered and stirred over a low flame until the bread takes on a ‚Äúporridge‚Äù consistency. A fresh egg yolk is added on top just before serving and creates a velvety finish when mixed in.¬†
Oh yes, best served with their 100% extra virgin olive oil! üòã
