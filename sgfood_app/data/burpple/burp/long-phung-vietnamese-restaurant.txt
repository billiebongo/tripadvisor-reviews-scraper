Birdie quail on the plate S$13.50
Cha Gio - Vietnamese Popiah $10.50 for 6
Opened till late, Long Phung is a popular go-to place for late post-work dinners, or a different kind of supper grub. Enjoy a classic chicken or beef pho, crispy fried spring rolls, a refreshing bowl of grilled pork with vermicelli, or garlic cockles. If you love spice, don\'t miss their Spicy Beef Stew Noodle Soup — it\'s so darn satisfying. It can get crowded, especially during meal times, so expect queues! For a really tasty, affordable Vietnamese fare at under $10, it\'s well worth the wait.
Couldn\'t find anyone. One of Singapore\'s mist colourful district and supper haunt. I need more supper kakis.
Checked this place out after seeing it featured on Burpple! Already a long queue brewing at 6pm, so do come early. Authentic vibes and I enjoyed the tenderness of the meat. Is this way better than Main Street Nam Nam? It\'ll be hard to say so! But at this price.. it makes it really value for money.

Wanted eggs but the thought of squeezing with kiddos and pseudo hipsters killed my appetite. So it\'s back to long phung for some soupy goodness. Terribly slow service today though.
Still my favourite Vietnamese place in SG. Just don\'t piss any of the surly ladies especially during busy hours. 😁
Upon entering, you\'ll smell the aroma of fish sauce and pipping bowls of Phò. Non-pretentious place, head there for your Vietnamese food craving but it\'s not a place for gatherings or to hold decent conversations. 
Probably one of the most authentic Vietnamese food I\'ve tried in Singapore!                                        Read my full review and the dishes I really love there at http://tengtengzxc.blogspot.sg/2014/10/long-phung-vietnamese-restaurant.html?m=1
Also known as \"So Huyet Xao Toi\" in their local language, this dish of cockles at Long Phung are tossed in a wok with chopped garlic galore, a dash of soya sauce and sugar. A combination that makes for a lip-smacking sauce which had us wondering if we should order a bowl of steaming hot rice to pour it over. But I digress... back to the cockles. We pried those babies open and swished them in the accompanying fish sauce with coarsely ground black pepper and smashed chilli for a dynamite bite.\n<br />Most people who give cockles a miss, dislike the metallic, bloody edge of raw cockles. That taste isn\'t obvious in this dish, so perhaps it\'s worth trying.
Here is the one to order if you like your sliced beef prettily pink. Since they open late, this is a great choice for supper because it isn\'t too heavy or rich.
Ordered spring roll, prawn pho and iced milk coffee
This is my go-to dish whenever I work late because they open till around midnight. The combination of grilled pork, fresh vegetables, rice noodles and fragrant herbs, all tossed in a Vietnamese light dipping sauce, never fails to bring on the bliss! Long Phung\'s pork fillet is very well marinated - you can taste the sweetness that\'s been deeply absorbed into the meat. I often wonder where they get their beansprouts - they are beautifully obese and pack a giant crunch. Yums!
This is a must try for hard-core coffee lovers! The authentic Vietnamese drip coffee ($3) is thick, rich and flavorful! Please visit us at http://thumbsforfood.blogspot.sg/2012/12/long-phung-joo-chiat.html for other food at Long Phung! 
Love this comfort food! At $5.50 a bowl, it\'s super affordable. Long Phung in Joo Chiat really does offer yummy authentic Vietnamese food that goes easy on the pockets! 
Going at $6 for a small serving, the Vietnamese roll is a perfect match with the dip for it! Love the tangy texture of it! 
Packed full with good ingredients! The soup was tasty, the noodles were not sticky and the beef was not over cooked! 
#burpple 👍🏻
Tasty pho @ quite an afforable price! 
That said, the teochew porridge from Teck Ee Rice Porridge that I had for lunch with my parents yesterday was not bad; the dishes were served hot (unlike some places where dishes are cold), and also tasted good (we like the duck meat, chai poh omelette &amp; kiam chai).\n<br />_______________________\n<br />Teck Ee Rice Porridge\n<br />300 Joo Chiat Rd (Tin Yeang Restaurant)\n<br />9.30am to 9.30pm\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphotography #sgfoodphotography #foodstagram #sgfoodstagram #instafood_sg #sgigfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgmakan #sgmakandiary #jiaklocal #sglocalfood #burpple #burpplesg #sghawkerfood #hawkerfood #sghawkers #teochewporridge #teckee #tinyeang #joochiat #sickmansfood

It’s really delicious. I really liked the rice paper rolls and the Bun Cha (fried spring roll with vermicelli). The dishes there are really awesome! I will definitely be back again! .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#vietnamesefood #eatviet #vietfood #foodie #foodporn #fooddairy #foodpath #foodtalk #foodstagram #ieatishootipost #foodjournal #foodjourney #ieatishootipost #l4l #followback #followforfollow #burpple

Somehow the more fiddly it is, the more I love it😈😈 The gong gongs here come with a tangy sour salt dip- unique #Vietnam style. Ever cleaned off a whole plate by myself, #noregrets👍😋 #repeatvisit #gonggong #seafood #burpple #yummy #foodporn #foodgasm #foodpics #foodie #igfood #instafood #foodstagram #igfoodie #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgeats #eatoutsg #foodphotography #foodspotting #igdaily #picoftheday
Awesome grilled pork! Well marinated and tender! \n<br />Love the vermicelli as well (But it\'s nothing special la. Can find this kind of vermicelli elsewhere. Smooth and it\'s thicker then the usual fried beehoon and thinner than the thick beehoon)
Developed a new love for rice paper.. It was love at first taste.

Chunks of Chicken Thigh Meat, Veggies and Peanuts with a flavorful and sweet ginger Dressing. Really refreshing! #weekend #dinner #vietnam #vietnamese #chicken #salad #paleo #eatclean
If you thought Nam Nam was good, wait till you get a hold of this Bowl of Pho! #weekend #dinner #vietnam #vietnamese #pho #beef #goodfood #herbs
Thus, I just had to find some authentic Vietnamese Food. And I found it! First up, Spicy Beef Stew Noodle Soup. Much much better than Nam Nam for sure(: #weekend #dinner #vietnam #vietnamese #pho #beefstew #herbs
Still the best: Viet fried spring rolls
Nicely marinated grilled pork in vermicelli. Yums.
