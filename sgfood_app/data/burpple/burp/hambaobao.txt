I thought this was good with the pork belly being crispy and tasty. I had to wait 45 minutes for this and enjoyed it after that! Hopefully it opens again somewhere else!
Visited Hambaobao a couple of times in the past but they simply blow me away every single time ‚Äî each visit just gets better; if only my classes are more in-line with their operating hours!
Hambaobao resides on the top floor of Beauty World Centre, standing out amidst the typical hawker centre food. It has a small menu offering burgers and other sides (such as fries) and what immediately stands out is the price... $5. Each burger costs $5! That\'s pretty amazing on its own...
‚úîGenerous and nice at first bite (the oil made it very gelat after a few bites) crispy pork\n<br />‚úîNice fries\n<br />‚ùåToo oily burger (fried bun similar to Ramly burger but a lot more oily)
Pork..pork.. PORK! üê∑üòã\n<br />Waited for about 2 hrs to catch this latest craze: Pork Belly Burger from @hambaobao. ü§ó Tbh, They\'re slayin\' roasted pork game -- slaying em good! Tasty-crispy fats with tender meat, dressed with english mustard, and cucumber slices. I\'d still go for it even if it\'s served like normal roasted pork rice.\n<br />Wasn\'t as impressed with their Spicy Pulled Pork and Ayam Buah Keluwak -- i guess there\'s a reason ‚òùthat up there is their best seller.
My friend had this whole burger to herself, i only had a bite.. its a 2+ hours wait + queue. Situated in a kopitiam @ beauty world. 
One bite and you get this explosion of soft, juicy dory with a kick home made tartar, top it off with some roasted peppers, zucchini and a toast bun.\n<br />-\n<br />It literally melts in your mouth. Better be ready to get those fingers dirty, cause Monster will lick them all clean.\n<br />-\n<br />üì∏ by @starbuckschickenrice\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #hambaobao
Yes I could. The fat to meat ratio is perfect, each mouth promises melting fat and well seasoned meat; topped with mustard, cucumbers and a toasted bun.\n<br />-\n<br />This is hands down my favorite burger! Monster loves crispy pork belly and you should too!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #hambaobao
The meat is juicy, spicy, tender and bursting with smokiness, Topped off with slaw and a crispy warm bun all for $5! Add on for fries for $1.\n<br />-\n<br />What are you waiting for? Monster is waiting for seconds.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #hambaobao
My hunt for food brought me to Beauty World Food Centre this time. I remember coming here all the time when I was younger. All the memories of attending my dreaded tuition classes there. Let me just take a deep sigh of relief that I no longer attend any tuition. 
Hambaobao: Beauty World Centre Hawker Centre #04-49\n<br />Most Right Cripsy Pork Belly - $5\n<br />Middle The Classic Beef - $5
First of all I know it\'s not for everyone but I LOVE Ayam Buah Keluak!! The patty in this burger is made with minced chicken and buah keluak, and while I love the flavor and its bitterness, this was slightly too bitter for me. I loved the use of chap chye though!! 10/10 for creativity and innovation, I just think the overall flavor can be improved maybe by adding something to complement the bitterness.
The hoisin and mustard sauce - genius combination!! Though to be honest I\'m partial to hoisin sauce on anything. The pork belly was really crispy and I loved that they put cucumber instead of the usual lettuce cause it really brought the burger together. And the buns were well buttered and crispy and fluffy!!
$5 for this wholesome burger, crispy homemade pork belly. Super shiok.
That Dory Fish (SGD5) has a succulent slice  of dory fish with tartar sauce, zucchini, red pepper and cheese. I added on bacon (SGD0.50) and fairy fries (SGD1) as sides. I love it becomes the fish was slightly charred and yet juicy! \n<br />His was the classic beef (SGD5) which has a beef patty, cheese, homemade tomato sauce, pickles and lettuces. It\'s yummy too!
#throwback to this moment when I traveled from the far east to the wild west for these burger beauties. IMO, Hambaobao serves one of the best and affordable burgers in Singapore. Mad love for their crispy pork bun! Their sio bak patty was way crispier and juicier than most roast delight stalls I know of. Worth every of my penny and travelling time ü§ó -\n<br />üì∏: @ilostmyfarts
Nested in Beauty World Food Centre. We had their Crispy Pork Belly Burger ($5). Absolutely crispy pork belly, Japanese cucumber, mustard and teriyaki sauce. We love the texture of the crispy crackling skin, as well as the extra crunchiness from the cucumber. Teriyaki sauce gave a strong sweet and salty taste to this burger with an additional kick from the mustard. Additional side of hand cut potato wedges for $1. So....Pull pork burger next? üòã
Spiced Pulled Pork Burger üê∑ üçî ($5.00 nett) 
Does it look \"healthier\" with all those cabbage? It definitely doesn\'t but who cares when it\'s sooo darn good. The pulled pork was so well-marinated, more towards the salty side (which I love!) with enough kick. Even when I was halfway through my burger, the marination started to drip gloriously and gosh, I just had to wipe them clean with the hand-cut fries ($1 top up, which you will regret of not getting)! 
Finally caught them again after realizing that they don\'t open on Monday and Tuesday. Trying their beef variant for the first time, which is pretty mean for a $5.00 burger. Sure, the bun is slightly greasy as though fried, but there is certainly something delightful about crisp burger buns grilled on the underside that gives a crackling sound the moment you sink your teeth in to savour it. Coming with all the conventional ingredients, it is pretty much a safe combination, but one that is nowhere boring. Melted cheddar on a tender minced beef patty that was juicy, lettuce, pickles and a handmade tomato sauce which bore a texture similar to pur√©e. And if a burger is not enough, it wouldn\'t hurt the pocket to opt for the additional Fairy Fries at a dollar more, which are hand cut chips feeling like a crossover of wedges and fries; soft yet crisp around the potato skin, seasoned ample amount of salt to flavour. Hambaobao is indeed becoming my solution for a local, indie joint for my fast food burger fix at prices that is easy on the pocket!
With minced chicken patty, rempah and chap chye. Chap chye in a burger? Yes please so smart I love chap chye. Also, while I\'m definitely not a Peranakan food expert, this buah keluak patty is pretty goooood. And $5 only?? 
This is the ayam buah keluak burger. The patties were really soft and patties were juicy. If this flavour isn\'t for you, their standard beef cheeseburger were good too.
This was a surprise yet good find as we originally wanted to try the western food stall. \n<br />It\'s located at an obscure area of the almost forgotten Beauty World food centre. \n<br />I had broiled dory fish burger (SGD$5) which came with red pepper, grilled zucchini, cheese, tar-tar sauce and dory fish fillet. Tender piece of fish, with soft fluffy buns, and I added bacon and extra cheese for $0.50 each. \n<br />We also add on fairy fries (SGD$1) which are hand-cut potato wedges. Love how it\'s bite-sized and addictive.
He said the beef was juicy and nicely done. One of the cheapest yet quality burgers we ever tried. \n<br />Overall, I think burgers are of quality. Besides the humid hawker environment and lack of utensils, I think this place makes for a good burger fix joint.

With a choice of five burgers that cost no more than $5 each, Hambaobao located in Beauty World Food Centre stands out quite a bit from its neighbouring stalls (be it the menu or the stall front). The burger joint offers no-frills burgers but a few unusual options on the menu that is with an Asian twist. The Crispy Pork Belly burger ($4.50) came with slices of crunchy Japanese cucumber, toasted buns, tender meat and really crispy crackling skin, completed with a slight kick from the mustard sauce. Beware the must-try hand cut Fairy Fries ($1 with a burger and $1.50 a la carte) is very addictive!
A hawker stall at Beauty World selling homemade burgers. Used to hang out here after school in the past. \n<br />Ayam Buah Kerluak burger was an adventurous try. I am not entirely sure if I like it completely, but will try their other flavours next time. \n<br />Must highlight their fries. Too long I havnt ate fries made of real potatoes.
This was a surprise discovery as I didn\'t really take notice of it at first. The pulled pork was so succulent and juicy and the portion was so generous; the meat was spilling out of the burger after my first bite! The homemade coleslaw was amazing; unlike normal coleslaw which is usually drowned in mayonnaise, the white and purple cabbage used  was nice and crunchy and gave a nice mix in contrast to the wet and runny pulled pork. A wonderful combination of flavours! I will be trying the double meat version of this on my next visit!!
It was difficult to snap a picture as it was evening when I came over, but I still managed to capture all the ingredients of the burger. The roasted pork was reasonably crispy, with a reasonable amount of porkiness to the flavour. I really liked the mustard that accompanied it, which is quite synonymous with the dish. The cucumber as the vegetable base was also a smart choice with the crunchiness matching the crackling roast pork. I liked the terriyaki sauce dressing which gave the entire burger a nice balance of sweet and saltiness.
This has got to be one of my favourite burger joints in Singapore since discovering it on a random online search for good burgers. First visited HBB when it was first starting out, and have never looked back. Since then, they have added options to add meat and bacon. For this one I had an extra patty. My picture doesn\'t do this burger justice, but the beef patties are just epic - they are made with freshly ground beef, with a fresh mix of meat and herbs which bursts (literally) with juice upon each bite. You can actually see some of the sauce at the bottom bun.
Burgers from @hambaobao and Teh O Peng from the drinks stall beside it at Beauty World Centre. (Google \'Keropokman\' to read more)
This was last night\'s quick dinner from another pair of Gen Y hawker. Fabulous burgers from @hambaobao, we are back to get more. They ran out of Crispy Pork Belly last night. Fairy fries are their version of hand cut potato wedges.
Dont think anywhere else sells Sio Bak Hambaobao! But beware, there is actually wasabi mayo in the burger! Shall revisit to try this again without wasabi next time
Hidden in beauty world food centre, lies a hidden gem. Each handmade burger is not more than $5.00. This store run by a couple of young people (comparing them to the old timers there), is set to stay. Quite delish, and you can taste their sincerity in each burger, you can\'t help but to complain the size! BECAUSE WE WANT MORE 
Located in Beauty World Food Centre is Hambaobao, a burger stall keeping things simple with only 5 items on their menu: Classic Beef, Broiled Dory Fish, Spiced Pulled Pork, Crispy Pork Belly and Ayam Buah Keluak. For wasabi lovers, go for the pork belly burger ($4.50), which is broiled without any oil, leaving the skin crispy and the meat tender, and completed with a good hit of wasabi mayo. For something extremely unique, opt for the Ayam Buah Keluak ($5) ‚Äî a good play on classic Peranakan flavours. With burgers ranging from only $4.50-5 and only an additional $1 for a side of handcut fries, don\'t hesitate to support these passionate young hawkers! 
new kid on the block at a very dated and old world charm bukit timah beauty world centre. but for good food, will travel. presentation may not be much but taste was well balanced with this nicely moist beef patty encased in aged cheddar and home made tomato sauce. kinda an exactly replica of what you would have at Macdonalds but with a more home made touch. my only gripe is i had to handle the burger wit my bare hands. not a welcoming thought especially after i was touching greasy dollar notes from other hawkers.
It was a pleasant experience dining at hambaobao despite the conditions, it is really affordable and could you add on (personally my favourite siew yok) for jus 2 dollars if i remember  !!!! Do come and try
How moist and how manly can my appetite get? I\'m still not full from this üò©
OMG! I really love this burger! It is so suited for my taste! Wasabi mayo sauce, fresh cucumber and crispy pork belly! A nice twist from the  standard pork burger! And it it only S$4.50 only! Must try! \n<br />#burpple #hambaobaosg #crispyporkbellyburger #nofrillfoodstore #burgers
Was surprise to find this new shop! Usually I just go directly to Pink Candy for the Korean food there. This is a nice addition to the dreary food \"scene\" at Beauty World. \n<br />#burpple #hambaobaosg #burgers #nofrillfoodstore
Hidden in this old-school shopping centre in its hawker centre-like food court is Hambaobao, a new stall that sells affordable burgers. Broiled Dory Fish Burger comes with homemade tartar sauce, cheese, red pepper, grilled zucchini and a broiled dory fish fillet. Buns were soft, but were not lightly grilled hence was a bit boring. Broiled Dory Fillet was fresh and lightly crusted by the sides so as to give the burger a bit of crisp. Loved the softly-grilled zucchini which was pretty refreshing. Cheese was a tad similar to Fillet-O-Fish though
Soft buns which were a delight to have, but lack the crispness as it is not grilled. Condiments include pulled pork, cheese and coleslaw. Pulled Pork seemed a slight dry, though I love how crisp it was due to the grilling. The flavours were slightly confused though, as the coleslaw and cheese seemed to have stole the show completely from the pork. Cheese was also a bit uninspiring as it tasted similar to the one used in Fillet-O-Fish. Fairy Fries were well-filled with potato, soft and came with skin-on, well seasoned with salt but a wee bit too oily.

Do support Ryan and Claire as they toiled the grills to bring you authentic and delicious burgers. This time round, I observed how they cook the pork using the \"hot air roaster\"(?) that brings us the crunchy Sio Bak burger which I had the last time. Fairy Fries used to cost an additional $1 though, times are catching up üòî
bless u for giving me an alternative to macs
This place is helmed by two pretty young folks, and has attracted a number of rave reviews over the past few years.

Crispy Pork Belly burger: Pay $5.50, receive priceless happiness. I haven\'t had such a magical burger in a long long time, and this really hit the spot. While the wait was rather treacherous (a good 20-25 minutes), all negative feelings are erased completely within a bite of the burger. 
Verdict: Beef was good, pork was to die for ( but fatty also la) BUT the buah keluak chicken burger was üò£ ( I just didn\'t get it and will never, like erggghhhh, no, its not you its me). And please please please go for the fries üòç. The whole meal (3 burgers 1 fries came up to $17.50 so good value for money I would say) \n<br />#burpple #burger #pork #beef #fooddiary #foodreview #sgfoodie #sgfood #sg #hawker #instafood #instadaily

The Short Review
Who needs pretentious ambience when you have amazing burgers made from scratch
The classic beef burger [$4.50] comes with a generous serving of beef patty with a slice of cheese fused on top of it. Topped with lettuce, pickles, caramelised onions and homemade tomato sauce. With an additional top up of $1 for fairy fries. This no-frills burger taste way better than it looks and the homemade potato fries were really addictive. Kudos to the chef for tirelessly preparing the burgers one after another and still showing so much enthusiasm. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #sgeats #jiaklocal #eatoutsg #burpple #instadaily #igsg #burger #setheats

The hamburger is really juicy and flavourful! Consider that it is just S$4.50 it way passed my expectation! Very nice! \n<br />#burpple #hambaobaosg #theclassicbeefburger #beautyworld #nofrillfoodstore #burgers
Juicy beef patties with homemade tomato sauce.
Not a fantastic burger but why not for $6?
