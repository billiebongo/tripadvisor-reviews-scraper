Yet another simple yet brilliant dish that\'s flawlessly executed, so delicious and evoking of childhood nostalgia at the same time. Timed precisely such that the liver is slightly under and still continuing to cook when it reaches our table ensures that the meat is sublimely tender but still retains a slight crunch. There was nary a trace of the smell of liver, but if there were, it would surely be masked by the copious amounts of ginger and spring onion anyway.
Beholden of beguilingly glossy, burnished skin boasting a crisp, lacquered sheen, the duck is tender and undeniably fragrant from being cooked in the restaurant\'s lychee wood fired oven. Multiple award winning Cantonese chef Tan Yong Hua divulges he coaxed the recipe out of a famous Peking Duck chef during a business trip to China.
This was a very comforting, homely bowl that I\'ll definitely order again. An interesting medley of textures mainly from the Japan jyounsai - a green plant covered with mucilage that gives a slippery, gelatinous texture; juicy honshimeiji, tender chicken fillet and wolfberries giving additional sweetness to the flavourful chicken consomm√©. \n<br />Here at @restauranthomesg, they want everyone to experience the joy of eating at home and such efforts are evident - you can feel it in the dishes - and best of all, they cater to the health-conscious with no msg added to any dishes, neither are any of the dishes overly oily.
If you order the excellent Peking Duck here, you can also request for the remaining meat to be done one of two ways - wok-fried with ginger and spring onion or deep-fried(pictured here). The crispy but tender duck is coated in a pungent roasted mince garlic and dried chili crust that\'s also peppery and salty. All I need is a Tiger now.
Judged on its own merits, this is a good dish. The slippery thick and thin beehoon mix is coated in a savoury dark sauce, and the pork knuckles are soft and collagen rich. But with such a parade of knockouts course after course, I\'d be hard-pressed to order this again.
Plump clams swimming in a tongue tingling \"tao cheo\"(fermented soy bean paste) sauce spiked with curry leaves, which totally elevates this dish from being merely good to highly addictive. Rice mandatory.
The chef-d\'≈ìuvre of our entire meal - succulent whole fish in a pool of sauce so good you\'ll want to lap it up.
Not merely spectacle, salt baking fish allows it to retain its moisture and seasons it at the same time. Waiting on our waitress as she carefully cracks open the salty crust to gradually reveal the whole fish within only served to heighten our anticipation. And it didn\'t disappoint, as the golden snapper\'s flesh was fresh, flaky and tender, complemented beautifully by a Thai influenced lime and homegrown chili spiked fish sauce.
Such a comforting bowl of pork liver, it felt like a dish from grandma. The liver is really smooth and tender, served in a stone pot that will keep the stock bubbling for minutes even after it\'s served. To find an excuse to slurp up the gravy, we asked for rice and pour that gravy all over.
Both beehoon and tanghoon are used in this dish. The mix of these noodles create an interesting mix of texture, but it shines further because Chef Tan had given precise instructions to the noodles factory on how to manufacture the noodles to his desired texture, thickness and consistency.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I\'m always impressed when a chef creates something excellent out of a simple dish, without needing superfluous or gimmicky ingredients. Although there are more sophisticated items on his menu, these simple dishes makes me feel right at Home.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is an invited taste
This is a decent set menu for small groups. Other items in this 4 course menu includes barbecued duck with lychee wood, baked green wrasse in claypot, braised duo rice vermicelli. At Restaurant Home, you can expect homely style cooking with lighter seasoning. Just like how your mum would want you to eat some delicious but healthy at the same time.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This photo is taken during an invited tasting.
The roasted duck was flavorful and not hard, the prawns were juicy, vegetables were fresh and overall a hearty meal. Rated 8/10.

The chicken is marinated overnight for the flavours to be absorbed into the tender chicken meat. It is baked for another 1.5 hours wrapped in lotus leaf and cooked with herbal sea salt before serving.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #baked #chicken
Fragrant crispy fried rice is poured into the sweet clam broth. It\'s like having a delicious bowl of porridge in superior stock with the addition of extra crispiness from the crispy rice.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #clamsoup #crispyrice
Crunchy and Freshly.\n<br />.
Chef Tan grows the rosella flower himself at his garden. The dessert has a sourish sweetness that is very refreshing.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #rosellaflower #dessert #jelly
We had the Black Pepper Crab ($58/kg) which is tossed in a fiery and piquant black pepper sauce. It goes well with the sweetness of the crab meat.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #restauranthomesg #blackpeppercrab
The whole golden snapper is covered with sea salt and baked to a nice moist texture which comes with slight hint of saltiness that enhanced the sweetness of the meat.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #bakedfish

This chapter of Chef Tan\'s story revolves around foods that he grew up eating and dishes that he has perfected using unique ingredients marrying with traditional cooking techniques to cater to the modern tastebuds.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />You might have read the Chicken Soup for the Soul series in your adolescent years or even now, but this is truly a comforting bowl of chicken soup for the soul. Using ingredients such as boiled Japan jyounsai, honshimeiji and wolfberries to enhance the flavour and texture, the chicken consomm√© with chicken fillet brings about a warmth feeling at every sip, just like a hot bowl of soup waiting for you to savour when at home.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @restauranthomesg\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Restaurant HOME\n<br />Address: 27, Cosford Road, Singapore 499549\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #restauranthomesg
üîº\n<br />So this was the plating for my braised pork knuckle noodles. Braised for hours, meat was super tender. You can literally taste all the herbs, spices and the porky flavor all at one go. The noodles., I presume, was thrown in and braised together with the porky gravy till it soaks up all the juices. Noodles surprising was not soggy...it was alittle aldente.\n<br />üîº\n<br />The oba leaf kept the noodles warm and the warmth lasted for quite a long time. Great dish great taste!! #noodles #noodlelover #hungrygowhere #lunch #stfoodtrending #burpplemessyeats #burpple #opensnap #narratrs #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #tripadvisor #discoversg #singaporeeats
This is part of my half duck meant to be eaten on its own or with the chinese crepe. Of course the crispy skin which was wrapped with scallions and cucumber (with sweet sauce or sugar) in the chinese crepe was gone in seconds.\n<br />üîº\n<br />Wonderfully golden brown and glistening skin. Duck is roasted over lychee wood. Very tasty. However, it has to be eaten with the sweet sauce as it was just a teeny weeny dry.\n<br />üîº\n<br />Duck so thinly sliced shows insanely good knife skills. Overall a yummy dish. \n<br />#pekingduck #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpplesg #burpple #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #narratrs #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #eatoutsg #eatbooksg #restauranthomesg #discoversg #chopesg
A heavy tinge of herbal but if you like herbal, this is quite manageable. üîº\n<br />Served cold with alittle syrup, balanced off by bits of mango. Good to know : each 100g sheath of rosella flowers contain 260mg vitamin C, 3x stronger than black wine, 9x stronger than citrus orange and 10x more than starfruit. üîº\n<br />So this is a powerful healthy dessert. Cost at $5 per bowl. It is actually quite refreshing after a heavy meal.
üîº\n<br />I am so wowed by this. Pumpkin soup with japanese mirin and lobster meat served in mini pumpkin cup. Tiny bits of lobster meat with mini chunks of crunchy vegs. üîº\n<br />Soup looked simple but the taste was deliciously intense. This is a serving for one pax. Cost at $12 but so worth it. üîº\n<br />Unfortunately, did not get to talk to Chef Tan as would have loved hearing his food journey stories. But I enjoyed the food so much that I have decided to come back to try the other items real soon. Recommended to try.
Who don\'t like this crispy version of fish skin. Available at Restaurant Home @the rail mall.  Rated one of the best restaurant. \n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #sgrestaurants #sgeat #eatbooksg #burrple #igsg #igsgfoodie #foodporn #instafoodsg #foodgasm #fishskin #sgfoodie #sgfav #sgfoodblogger #foodbloggersg

Prefer Tung Le Xihe Peking duck which is juicier . The duck served here seems less fatty .
