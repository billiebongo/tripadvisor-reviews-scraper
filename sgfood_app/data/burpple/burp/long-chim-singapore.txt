I love thai food. And did you know? On 30th March, LONG CHIM is having a $9++ per dish (for all dishes on the menu that day) to celebrate their anniversary? 😋😋
My favourite dish at @longchimsg! The wok hei was on point and the glass noodles was so flavourful!😋👌🏻 .\n<br />#goodthingsmustshare Long Chim will be celebrating their 1st anniversary! 💐🎉 On 30th March, they will roll out a special birthday menu where drinks and cocktails will be priced at just $9!! Such a steal!😁👌🏻
This is one of my favourite dish on @longchimsg\'s new menu! Actually I won\'t know that it\'s eggplant of I wasn\'t told. ☺️👌🏻
☺️ This banana roti, a popular Thai street food, did not disappoint. 😋👌🏻 Think crispy prata wrapped with bananas and drizzled with sugar and more condensed milk! Worth every bits of the calories! 😍
I don\'t even like eggplant, but @long.chim made me find their grilled eggplant salad irresistible. So unique, so yummy. I can eat this all day.
Banana Roti liberally doused with condensed milk and sugar. Sweet, sinful and oh so good! 😋
Textures and patterns around the restaurant call out to me, check out the vintage tiles at the entrance if you visit.\n<br />#LongChim #LongChimSG
So here goes nothing. || {Tilapia in salt crust}, possibly one of the best tasting dish at tonight\'s line-up of overtly spicy and over seasoned dishes. ♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />#whati8today#eatoutsg#instafood_sg#burpple#hungrygowhere#8dayseat
😱 House made spiced rum with port, apricot and angostura lit ablaze.
This was a good ending for the night. Well for those of us that like bananas. But the best part was the crispy roti covered in condensed milk sauce! It was so good I had to keep reminding myself it\'s just gluten and I\'m going to suffer eating it… but it was super addictive. I would order this again if I\'m dining at Long Chim in the future.\n<br />#LongChim #LongChimSG
A very fruity and sweet concoction, with rockmelon, gin, rose &amp; sauvignon blanc. Starting any meal with alcohol is never a bad thing.\n<br />#LongChim #LongChimSG
These little green wraps look so innocent but boy do they pack a punch. I backed out after one bite. Truly for those who love spiciness.\n<br />#LongChim #LongChimSG
Award-winning chef David Thompson’s Long Chim recreates Bangkok’s vibrant streets and markets in its swanky Marina Bay Sands digs, making it the perfect stop for some pre or post-show food and cocktails. With its buzzy vibes, this is probably not the best place for a quiet, romantic date, but it would definitely fit the bill if you’re looking to share some tasty nosh while on a laid-back one-on-one with someone special, or a fun night out with girlfriends. Besides its stellar service, what sets this place apart is its take on Thai street food — the interpretations here manage to add a chic, modern twist to the food while maintaining the authenticity of flavours. Long Chim is great at both their cocktails and bar bites, so get your appetites going with creative tipples like the tropical gin-based 555 ($18) while nibbling on moreish starters like Cured Pork Fritters ($18), before moving on to the mains. You will not go wrong with classics like Green Curry of Chicken ($24) and Pad Thai ($30), but more adventurous palates will likely appreciate lesser-known dishes like Sour Orange Curry in Snakehead Fish ($29) and Dtom Yam Super ($25) — a tangy broth with chicken wings and feet, livened with aromatics. To finish, the Durian Ice Cream ($15) packs a punch of unadulterated durian flavour into a scoop, but you may want to skip this if you’re planning on getting cosy after.
Monday morning cravings.
Alas they could be more generous with the booze. My 555 tasted like a fizzy cucumber drink although the coriander provided an interesting after taste. Although certainly refreshing, we did feel like we were drinking juice. 
David Thomson\'s Long Chim is an atas Thai diner (think $30 Phad Thai). Casual compared to Nahm, his award winning restaurant in Bangkok.  Go for the set lunches during weekdays, which are priced more affordably.
Cendol jellies with tender black glutinous rice, chunks of sweetened yam, fleshy coconut, corn kernels off the cob, not forgetting the \"attap-chees\" (young Palm seeds) soaking up that deliciously fragrant coconut broth; all of those sitting beneath a hill of crushed ice. \n<br />Doesn\'t look like much, nothing fancy about it, but it\'s one of my personal favourites of @longchimsg. It\'s the kind of sweet treat you keep going back for since it\'s so comforting. \n<br />A great excuse to cool off from the scorching afternoon sun too 😉\n<br />10bucks/bowl\n<br />#FTrecommends
The sauce was thick, salty, and sharply spicy – the kind of life partner every rice grain dreams of meeting, someday. The marquee name almost feels like a supporting actor here but is itself commendable for its crunchiness, although you may have to excuse how the squid heads often squirt their liquid squid head goodness into your mouth in a most impertinent manner. 4.1/5
Delectably fatty and salty, and wickedly spicy of the slow-burn, mouth-numbing variety. Remarkably humble a dish (and humbly-priced at $10), yet it spectacularly kickstarts the meal on a supernova explosive note. 4.3/5
Will he win top honours again at tonight\'s #asias50best as the judges have been changed to be more Asia-centric? Find out from DanielFoodDiary.com tonight.
Situated in MBS, their prices were on the higher side so having to dine here with some good discounts would definitely be a good catch!
chillies, thai basil, cucumber, roti
dried prawns, steamed egg
herbs, shallots, chillies
pistachio, young coconut
cured pork squid dried prawns
Thai tea, carnation milk, and sugar
the starter, Cured Pork Fritters was the favorite as it tasted a bit sour but coupled with a tinge of ginger and chilli, immediately bringing out the unique flavour in it..very pleasant dining experience with good service and ambience... #dinner # pickyeaterssg #michelinguide #amazing #nice #burple #sgfood #sg #foodporn #shiok #tomyam #mbs #longchimsg #foodgasm #instagood #hungrygowhere #sourstuff #thaifood #thaifoodstagram #igsg

Really worthy though!
Small prawns were crispy and prolly one of the better dish we had. A $9 just for the restaurant\'s one year anniversary. #lunch #anniversary #burrple #prawns #stfoodtrending #i8mondays #8dayseat #openricesg #hungrygowhere #chopesg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodies #bloggersg #igsg #longchimsg
If you\'re thinking of where to head to for dinner or after-dinner drinks tonight - you should swing by theirs for the $9 all day dishes and beverages happening today
Eggplant (buried below) was too soft and our expectations of a runny yolk was disappointing. This was a tad salty and the high side of acidity. One of the $9 dishes offered just for today which is the restaurant\'s 1 year hatch day🎂 #lunch #eggs #thai #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggersg #singaporeinsiders #longchimsg #marinbaysands #chopesg

|| Those who don\'t appreciate the mushy vegetable might actually come to love this intriguing rendition. The smokiness from the grilled eggplant surfacing in large doses amidst  a refreshing mix of fresh herbs with the christening of egg yolk to up the ante。\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />#whati8today#eatoutsg#instafood_sg#burpple#hungrygowhere#sipandgulp#8dayseat#singaporeinsiders#longchimSG#vscofood#sgfoodporn
It\'s pretty rare to have cocktails at a Thai restaurant right? And thai inspired cocktails? Sure.
Buttery and peppery hits of aroma punctuate the air as it landed on the table, the over intense savoury notes a hallmark of this dish and it trumps even Thai village version with its extra tinge of wok hei that lifts this classic into another stratosphere. Might be too robust for some but the slight citrusy sauce nearby gives it a temporary reprieve. Addictive :)\n<br />#bakedprawns #glassnoodles #vermicelli #thaiglassnoodles #noodles #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #longchimsingapore #longchim
Unpretentious and delicious. One of moi fav for tonight. 😋😋😋 #longchimsg #longchim
Tenderised protein infused with a perfectly caramelised sweet sauce that has the adequate levels of sweet and smoky bitterness. Wonderful beginning :)\n<br />#longchimsingapore #porkskewers #thaifood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #davidthompson
Delicious carbos are irresistible.

Was a tad too salty for me, but get in there with a bowl of rice, and it\'s all fine and dandy。
The external is crisp and internally soft. Accompanied by fried curry leaves which i happily devoured😉😄 ahh...so shiok!! #thai #fishcakes #sgfoodie #sgfoodbloggers #dinner #burpple #openricesg #tfjsg50
The Coconut Cake reminded me of a tapioca cake (Similar to a Singaporean/Malay Kueh). Local Desserts by Celebrity Chef David Thompson
The Pad Thai has the right balance of sweet, sour, salty and umami. The curry is also a good find...creamy with hints of fish sauce, palm sugar and curry. I love it but be prepared to sweat it since its it comes with a dose of heat. \n<br />Long Chim, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore \n<br />#SpotMyFood #foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #nomnomnom #foodbeast #foodstagram #amazing #eeeeats #thefoodspotter #yummy #sgfoodie #sgfood #indulgesg #feedme #getinmybelly #foodfeast #goodeats #eeeeats #f52grams #eatsingapore #onthetable #burpple #thaifood #padthai #curry
And you probably wouldn\'t want to know the amount of cream that went into a recipe of that too. \n<br />Absolutely DELISH!! 😍\n<br />15bucks/goblet\n<br />#FTrecommends
Too in love with this meal!\n<br />26bucks/bowl+6roti\n<br />#longchimsg #FTrecommends
Just look, you can visually see the amount of flavour that\'s packed into our soup. \n<br />Only at @longchimsg. \n<br />24bucks/pot\n<br />#longchimsg
🙈 teeheee!\n<br />These are mini Crunchy Prawns (head to tail, completely intact) seasoned well with Thai herbs. Yes please! \n<br />15bucks/plate\n<br />#longchimsg
Yeaap, it was THAT goood! Definitely top few on my list for reordering. \n<br />@junkielicious @dwaynemuang\n<br />17bucks/plate\n<br />#longchimsg
Durian ice cream, one of the best ones. 
$25 for a plate of fresh pad Thai loaded with shrimps, sprouts and peanut bits.. Hmm.. I shall pass it if I ever revisit. The flat noodles were too rubbery (specially imported and supposedly authentic texture that meant so) while the bean sprouts were way undercooked with offensive raw taste.. Aw..
Wonderfully fork tender without the gamey flavor. A good choice for non spicy eater. It comes with a bowl of refillable rice. 
This has been the best dish of the night. The chicken was baby tender with the marinates just right. We asked for a second order but the taste was not consistent, it arrived sweeter in the repeated round. #longchim #chefdavidthompson #mbs
Remember to eat with your bare hands not utensils for a more rustic experience! The filling emit a unforgettable prawn-paste taste but a tad too intense and sweet. One of their signature offering. 
Robust bitter sweet durian purée simply lingers..
