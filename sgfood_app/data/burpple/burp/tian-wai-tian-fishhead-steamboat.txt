Having fish head steamboat on a rainy weather like this is shiokness!
This plate of messy goodness is my favourite since young. Best dish to go with white rice.

So fat, juicy and fresh. Omelette ($9) were so crispy and fluffy. Fish soup ($22) was ok, I still prefer wampo more. Needed more flavours. Lime juice with plum was very nice. Not in the pic. üòÖ #fishsoup = #comfortfood #sgfood #burpple
