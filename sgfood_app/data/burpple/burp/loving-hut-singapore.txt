Never expected to actually walk into a vegan cafe. 🔼\n<br />There are \"mock this and mock that\" dishes and desserts. It seems to be a popular eatery cos customers just keep on streaming in. Ok... I am enjoying this rose tea latte with edible rose petals. Requested for a reduction in the rose syrup as I dont like my beverages sweet. A very comforting and wholesome latte. Haha... yes... I cannot believe I forgo my daily caffeine fix for this dainty tea.\n<br />🔼\n<br />A cool vegan gem right in my backyard.\n<br />Location : Loving Hut\n<br />229 Joo Chiat Road
Previous meal at Loving Hut which was Chicken Rice! Absolutely loved the mock seitan chicken and chilli! Rice was fragrant but not fragrant enough 😁 Really enjoyed it overall , I wish they have this everyday!
Loving this vegan restaurant . Everything taste nice and presentable. 
A very recommended cafe to dine in for all vegans, they serve local delights like mee siam, laksa and chicken rice?! Interesting food, nice ambience and reasonable pricing.
The coconut rice is fragrant &amp; they really put their heart to make the sides as tasty as the normal nasi lemak. 👍👍👍👍#burpple #pickyeaterssg #nomnomnom #foodstagram #foodie #foodsg #foodcoma #foodgasm #foodinsg #foodpics #foodspotting #foodstamping #foodphotography #dinner #instasg #instafood #instagood #instadelicious #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgfoodlover #sg #igsg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #vegan #vegansg #lovinghutsingapore
