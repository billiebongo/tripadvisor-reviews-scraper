added collagen (+S$3.80) to the pot, because I want nice skin la! 😄
Omelette was good. Fried rice was not bad. Beef short rib soup was so so..
4 munchies: Oozing with melted mozzarella and cheddar, these chunky egg rolls cradled a moist, soft-scrambled interior that serve as an excellent side dish for any meal of the day. The honey mustard added sweetness and zing to the omelette, offering a sweet contrast (or ending) to the savoury stews that this place is known for – the spicy seafood stew and pork rib stew are my favourites. #Burpproved

korean short beef ribs stew!! To be fair, this is not as nice as the ones you\'ll have in Korea, but good enough. Try to eat it while it\'s still hot and piping. #burpple #소갈비찜 #kalbijjim
Tender chicken and  spicy soup. I opted for 🌶out of 🌶🌶🌶🌶. Don\'t judge. The 🌶 meter is not accurate. The only problem is the glass noodles are too rubbery. Reminder to future self to take udon instead.
Keep them coming in. And.. One night before I head to Korea... I had Korean food for dinner. Very intelligent.
The rice bowl can cater for one to two persons，tunna is yummy. Price is acceptable.
Indulged in these dishes a bazillion times a week some months ago in the name of work; now, I\'m missing them very much, especially the kimchi soup that\'s given an added depth of flavour with Masizzim\'s beef rib stew sauce.
The pancake tasted like a pan fried, denser version of a tomato based- mozzarella cheese pizza. Of course with Korean ingredients- kimchi and tiny anchovies (that you could easily miss). \n<br />The egg rolls were delightful- with a faultless combination of melted cheese with honey mustard atop 😋
Aside from the killer stews, I really enjoyed the honey mustard cheese egg roll ($9.80) My personal favorite amongst the 2 egg rolls offered, this was egg as thick as a Christmas log stuffed with melty cheese and laced with sweet honey mustard. \n<br />The flavours were generally milder which were a nice contrast to the intensity of the stews, providing a nice balance to the meal. \n<br />Side note: I really like how you can call a service staff to your table by pressing that white button instead of frantically waving to no avail.
Having this Jjim (stew)on a cold day really hits you in the comfort zone. The pipping hot beef stew from Masizzim is packed with succulent, slightly oversized beef cubes mixed with the glass noodles in the thick beef stew. For an additional $7, you can change the rice provided into their awesome DIY handmade rice ball from their menu, which I really recommend if you are visiting Masizzim.
Ordered this to share with a Friend who cancelled last minute. And you know what, the loss is all his.
Had it with glass noodles &amp; a spicy level of 3. Shiok! 😄😋
Beef stew was hearty and broth was delicious! My brother wasn\'t feeling well so we opted for the miso broth, no spice. The egg roll was gooey cheesey deliciousness! Couldn\'t really taste the honey element though😂\n<br />We upgraded to tuna and anchovy riceballs as well- I prefer tuna as the anchovy is too crunchy-I lile my riceball to be soft and plus they tuna had mayo which was a total plus point!\n<br />We ordered the grapefruit yogurt drink to share and it was really refreshing; it has an icy texture which reminds me of slurpee! The grapefruit atop was a nice decoration.
-\n<br />Tuna Seaweed Egg Roll ($10.80).\n<br />-\n<br />Though the Honey Mustard Cheese Egg Roll will always be my first love, the Tuna Seaweed Egg Roll is a good option as well. A fluffy omelette roll stuffed with tuna flakes,  seaweed and drizzled with tomato sauce.
This was better than the crab &amp; roe version. A sprinkle of sesame seeds, a bed of shredded seaweed, a side of kimchi, a helping of tuna and a dollop of mayo! Nice la; how can you go wrong with such a combi! 😜🙂🙂😋
That slight sweetness of the crab meat 😜😝😋 went rather well with the mix of crispy shredded seaweed, a scoop of roe, furikake? And a dollop of mayo! Best part of this was witnessing my friend having so much fun rolling them!
A soft, moist and a tad sweet omelette with stretchy mozarella $9.80 (excl. service charges &amp; gst); anyone can do this at the comfort of his/her own home imo (with the right honey mustard sauce, of course!)
Spicy Korean buckwheat noodles; served slightly cold (on purpose); Taste-wise quite subpar, in fact I found the taste of the sesame oil a lil too overwhelming 😅 nothing 2 special sadly 😪🤐
3 munchies: Filled with seaweed and tuna flakes, these moist and chunky egg rolls were undoubtedly homely and utterly scrumptious. The omelette itself was good enough to be eaten on its own, so I thought it was a tad pity that the tomato sauce and mayonnaise drizzle ruined the dish a little for me. Go for the Honey Mustard Cheese Egg Roll instead if you\'re a fan of gooey mozzarella and cheddar with some zing!
Finally tried the Honey Mustard Cheese Egg Roll a couple of nights ago! But unfortunately this mixture of mozzarella and cheddar with eggs was a bit too gelat. Still worth a try though :) #burpple
I don\'t know about you, but imma be Team Anchovy. 😛
4 munchies: Cooked in Masizzim\'s secret recipe sauce, the new signature Spicy Seafood Stew is loaded with prawns, mussels, crayfish, a whole squid and topokki. Not only the spicy base was packed with umami goodness, there was also an abundance of clams in the clam-based broth to excite both seafood and spicy food lovers like me! The Spicy Seafood Stew is customisable with 4 levels of spice, and Korean udon or glass noodles.
I think I could drink a whole jug of this by myself! Tangy yet smooth, citrus notes make this drink super refreshing and slightly addictive. The alcoholic version would be heaps of fun to share with friends!\n<br />#MasizzimSG #GrapefruitYoghurt #313somerset
The addition of the QQ sweet potato noodles really perfect the whole dish - makes you really want to slurp and go \'ahhhh\' in this the weather! \n<br />Thank you @masizzimsg for feeding me and @sixthsensepr for the lovely invitation!
Very good seafood &amp; beef stew w/ glass noodles + rice, 2 pax portions but good to share for 3 if ordering sides. Honey mustard cheese egg roll is a must order as well! Huge portion 
Well done braised pork stew with glass noodles &amp; dobokki. The meat is just so tender and flavourful. Just that it\'s too dry as a stew i complain of.
Masizzim now offer even more varieties!! Stews served in cast-iron pots, kept bubbling hot with live flames. New dishes include Spicy Seafood Stew ($36.80) or Spicy Seafood Beef Stew ($38.80), adding your choice of Korean udon, sweet potato glass noodles, topokki or cheese. Base are made of gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and you can choose the level of spiciness, max is 4 though level 2 was probably my best before flames comes out!
•\n<br />Cheers to brews cos it\'s #InternationalBeerDay!\n<br />•\n<br />What better way to celebrate the weekend than with a pint of Honey Slush Beer ($15.80)? Cold pint of beer embellished with a swirl of ice blended beer, drizzled with premium honey. 건배! 🍯🍺🍻
.\n<br />Playing with rice balls because still no news of playing poke balls in sg. 😑\n<br />.\n<br />Prefer the latter as anchovy adds some subtle fish fragrance to the rice ball where crabmeat roe was paler in comparison.
This cheese tomato pancake is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside... Different from the traditional type of korean pancake I would say.. worth a try
Beef Stew ($16, level 2 spicy) came w generous amount of tender/rich beefy flavored beef cubes, stew itself was thick, roasty, and slightly hot (you can choose the level of spiciness), soooo good w rice. Spring onions, mushroom slices and kimchi (so good; acidic, fresh, crunchy) gave it extra, well blended flavors. Best comfort dish for cold, rainy days! 
.\n<br />My virgin attempt at the much raved place which specializes in Korean Stew and went straight for the level 3 spicy stew in view of the recent chilly weather.\n<br />.\n<br />Spicy yes, but next time I would prefer my soup to have a balance between spicy and robust flavour. 🤔
The one thing to get here is this glorious tomato cheese kimchi pancake. The tomato base Korean pancake was slightly savoury, crispy at the sides and spongy in the middle, topped with a pool of mozzarella cheese. Seriously drool worthy! 
Choice of 3 stews here: Beef ribs, pork ribs and chicken. I tried all and found the chicken stew the most pathetic one, in terms of portion, price and taste. At $16/$18++ for one pax, I feel the stews are rather expensive. Each stew comes with plain rice and you can top up $6 for a rice ball. I preferred the tuna rice ball over the anchovy. Skip the steam egg, which wasn\'t smooth and very ordinary. There is free flow of kimchi and mash potato with corn.
One of the greatest feeling that exists.\n<br />It\'s Friday again, one month has officially passed &amp; I\'m nearing the halfway mark in this wonderful journey. Haven\'t been eating or going out (you get what I mean) lately but as compared to the past, I found out that there is indeed a cure to my chronic insomnia. I honestly can\'t even recall the last time I slept after 3am, &amp; that\'s definitely a positive sign - don\'t have to keep reminding myself to migrate to a different timezone no more 😂\n<br />I genuinely hope that things will stay this way. But I also foresee that they\'ll get better too. Experience never gets old, let\'s all enjoy this while it lasts. TGIF.
this came w 2 bowls of brown rice. we ordered lvl 2 spiciness and glass noodles and it provides sufficient kick alr. the chicken pieces came w many bones which is kinda annoying. there were also pieces of carrots n potatoes.
Tender and juicy, flavourful! One of my favourite Korean food joints, definitely. They serve up pretty much a true blue Seoulite-type food. Do you know what Masizzim actually means? Masizzim literally means ‘Delicious stew’ in Korean. And boy, they got it right. This is the signature of all their signature dishes: \n<br />Beef stew (소갈비찜) 😍 \n<br />For those who haven’t tried this, try adding on the noodles and cheese for the ultimate enjoyment. Hope you’ve enjoyed this series, and check out the blog for more reviews!
This series will just show you the foods that I love from this place. Straightforward and probably pretty much a true blue Seoulite-type food.  Here’s another dish that worked very well for me, and probably one of my favourite type of balls:\n<br />Tuna Riceball (참치 셀프 주먹밥) 😍\n<br />For those who haven’t tried this, this is served with Korean white rice, seaweed crumbs, crushed chilli padi and tuna / anchovy. I usually take the tuna version, it’s a lovely savoury mix for me. Just put on the plastic gloves provided and you’ll have fun before eating it too; because you get to knead them yourself. Just remember to mix them real good. And if you don’t like them in the shape of balls, what’s stopping you from being creative?\n<br />Also, stay tuned for my final Massizim post, coming up soon :)
This place is one of the restaurants I returned so many times, because of its delish signature dishes. They are one of those who knows what they are cooking.\n<br />Authentic Korean food? ✔\n<br />Satisfying korean tastebuds? ✔\n<br />Unlike alot of \'new\', \'fusion\' korean eateries who popped up in the little red dot just because they wanted to ride a little k-wave, this one is legit delish for me. Here is one dish that worked very well for me. \n<br />The bibim naengmyeon 비빔냉면. 😍\n<br />For those who havent tried this, this is served cold and very good to have in our SG weather. Will be sharing other dishes in the next two posts. :)
slow-cooked for 6 hours - beef was soft &amp; tender while the thick spicy broth was super tasty; spiciness level 2 😋
4 munchies: Marinated overnight and slow-cooked for at least six hours, the pork ribs were so soft and tender they slid off the bones easily. The sweet, savoury broth was a delectable blend of soy sauce, pineapple and Korean pear, which complemented the addition of chewy glass noodles and topokki really well. Both the anchovy and tuna with kimchi rice balls are good options to pair with the stew, too!
😋 loved the sweet, spicy flavour of the pork ribs stew the most. And those tuna rice balls were so yummy!! #burpple #foodspotting #foodporn #foodstamping
Chicken stew slow-cooked for 6 hours in special Masizzim recipe sauce until tender and flavourful. They also have customisation to choice of noodles, spice level and toppings 》$16 (Single Portion) / $29 (Double Portion)​
Rice Balls with Anchovy, with Korean white rice, seaweed crumbs and crushed chilli padi $8 (Ala-carte) / $6 (Upgrade rice from stew)
Pork ribs stew slow-cooked for 6 hours in special Masizzim recipe sauce until tender and flavourful. They also have customisation to choice of noodles, spice level and toppings​ 》$16 (Single Portion) / $29 (Double Portion)​
Ordered the most spicy level and it was really quite spicy!! But I felt that this dish was quite ordinary, nothing too special, would choose other more authentic home-cooked Korean food over this anytime 🙈
Pretty disappointing given the craze over it.. Tasted pretty mushy too??:-( 
Had a chicken stew, pork stew and some DIY rice ball.
Ikan bilis, seaweed crumbs, crushed chili padi and korean rice all rolled into one. Simply delicious! 😚\n<br />See the review on Masizzim at www.thehungrygeek.com (See bio for link)
🎊 Heading to town but not sure what to eat? @masizzimsg might be a great idea! Their soy flavoured pork rib stew is impressive! We finished the stew down to the very last drop 😋😋 See our latest food review on Masizzim! Find link at our bio 😊

3 munchies: Available only in the spicy option, the Level 2 (of 4) spiciness for the chicken stew was just nice for some kick. A tad pity that the chicken was on the drier side, though. I also wished there was more broth to go with other ingredients like the glass noodles, topokki, carrots, and potatoes. The option to upgrade to the anchovy rice balls for your side, which you will be moulding yourselves, is highly recommended!
Not only a must try for egg lovers but everyone. It was gone within 1min once served.
The cheese and tomato makes it taste more like pizza than a kimchi pancake. I hope it can be crispy with more distinctive taste of kimchi. If u Like pizza, no harm trying!
So tender that the meat will drop off from the ribs. -👭
Masizzim, a Korean casual restaurant specialising in Korean meat stew dishes also serves up unique Do-It-Yourself riceballs for those who like to play with food (like me). A robust blend, the stews are customizable with a choice in portion size (individual or double), protein, carb, add-ons and level of spiciness. Of course, to share, I recommend getting one non-spicy (soy) and a spicy stew to get the best of both worlds. For the soy sauce flavour, we decided to go for pork ribs and Korean udon. The umami taste of the base and the tender marinated pork ribs are definitely a must-order for me. Also, you can upgrade your steamed rice to their rice balls that comes in two options, anchovies and tuna. We chose the former and I had fun shaping the mixture of medium-grain white rice, Korean black rice, crispy anchovies, seaweed crumbs and crushed chilli padi. Hearty and comforting, Masizzim is a pretty good dinning choice for gatherings in town.
I love Korean dishes, but rarely could I find a place with everything I love! That\'s why I am loving Masizzim so much. The cheesy kimchi pancake, the spicy beef ribs stew (lvl 1-4, we took the challenge of lvl 3, which is just right for me to enjoy the dish without burning my throat), and the self-rolled rice balls!! Omg everything was soooo shiok!! Being the sister branch of Chir Chir, i can\'t choose which do i love more. Bring more friends if you want to try everything like i did!
Although Masizzim is highly regarded for their stews, they do an excellent soup too. \n<br />We\'re talking beefy goodness at Jedi-level, so you\'re guaranteed potent flavour in every steaming hot sip. There\'s no fear of not filling your tummy either because each pot contains a few pieces of large, tender beef rib as well.\n<br />Oh dear... I\'m getting hungry just thinking about it!\n
Not worth the hype. Personally think that this is best for children, where they can physically play with the food and roll the rice into rice balls. With that being said, the rice is well seasoned with very yummy, crispy, tiny anchovies, seaweed and beautiful and healthy brown/purple rice. It is truly a good bowl that goes well with their sides or stews, even delicious on its own. Just minus all that fuss of mixing and rolling them into balls and eat straight from the bowl. 
Most steamed eggs are rather plain tasting. Not this one because there\'s beef stock used in there. The egg\'s extremely hot when it arrives at the table - you can see it still bubbling away in the black metal pot (so please proceed to eat with caution!) Personally, I find the fluffy lightness of it a perfect foil for the rich and heavier dishes on the menu. A must-try for egg lovers.
I didn\'t expect the pork rib in this small pot of stew to be so exceedingly tender - the meat was literally falling off the bone! Also, if you are like me, an adorer of cartilage, you\'ll be delighted to know about half of the ribs simmering in the thick, spicy gravy, packed on beautifully soft, crunchy cartilage. \n<br />Now about that gravy. I got to choose from 4 levels of spiciness and since I didn\'t want to risk numbing my tongue and ending up not tasting my food properly, I settled on level 2. Even then, I felt it had a satisfying burn.\n<br />This flavourful dish was indeed fulfilling on so many levels. Even the single portion I ordered (which came with a small bowl of rice) seemed to contain enough pork rib to be shared between two diners with average-sized appetite.
The glass noodles was like transparent Kueh tiao with chewy texture, not the tang hoon type which I was expecting. The pork ribs was fork tender but boney too. The sauce was rich and thick, best with rice. \n<br />Quite fun trying to form rice balls with the disposal gloves.\n<br />|\n<br />Masizzim \n<br />Address 🏠 : 313 Orchard Road, # B3-03 313 @ Somerset, Singapore 🇸🇬 238895\n<br />Tel ☎️ : 6509 5808\n<br />Open 💈 : \n<br />Sun-Thu : 11am-10pm\n<br />Fri-Sat : 11am-11pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Somerset (NS23)
CHEESEEEEEE!
Can I have a Spicy Cheese Fried Rice (SGD 9) right now? Seriously I can\'t resist thinking of this cheesy goodness of the melted mozzarella cheese over the kimchi fried rice.
The beef ribs must have been swimming in the gochujang sauce for quite a long time as the meat falls off the bone very easily. In addition, the collagen on the meat creates an umami flavour from the long stewing process.
In front of me were a group of ahjummas (with the signature permed hair and colourful windbreakers) chattering away excitedly, taking photos of the queue and them being in the queue. I figured, wow if this comes from their homeland and they\'re still willing to wait this long for it then it must really be something right?\n<br />Masizzim the name is a compound word which means \"delicious stew\". Sorry friends, I don\'t eat beef, so we went for the pork rib stew. Here are the key experiences:\n<br />- Fall off the bone meat\n<br />- Full-flavoured thick gravy\n<br />- Scraping the bottom of the pot at the end (don\'t waste the meat!)\n<br />Final verdict: 진짜맛있다! \n<br />We also had the squid and leek pancake which was light and crisp, one of the better versions I\'ve had in Singapore. The tuna rice balls were fun for us to roll (cue in ball jokes) though most of them were misshapen and probably too big to pop into our mouths whole (cue in \"that\'s what she said\").\n<br />The cost of the meal surprised us all: even without my voucher from #Burpple (weee thanks!), it was less than $80 for a double-portion stew, two bowls of tuna rice, pancake, sikkye drink - aka a really full dinner.\n<br />Guess I\'ll join the ahjummas again some day.
It is more to a traditional Korean pancake with generous amount of leek and squids, ensuring that you will not missed any ingredients in every bite. This time round it was crispier and tasted even better than the one I had previously. Do dip it in their house blended dipping sauce to enhance the flavour.
😍😍😍 Always love those balls! \n<br />Just a small part of the meal featuring my favorite Masizzim\'s Rice Ball (SGD 6 only with 1 stew ordered) and Beef Ribs Stew (SGD 18/SGD 32) with a spicy base at level 4! The Australian beef short ribs still fall-off-the-bone tender as usual, with those delicious Korean glass noodles in the stew too. The spicy level of the sauce this time is power 👍👍👍 (still small case to us haha) and it is just divine to eat together with those hugh rice balls!
Super crispy surface with lots of ingredient in it! It doesnt taste soggy even after a long period. This is so far the most tasty pancake i ever tried
Don\'t know what\'s the extreme right dish, it was pretty good. But can be more generous with the quantity!
For someone who doesn\'t like Korean food, this was actually pretty tasty, with melt-off-the-bone tender beef, luscious stew that bubbled down into a thick gravy to ladle on and mix into rice.. Cold day comforts.
Beef Rib Stew - Favourite.\n<br />The beef that can slide off from the bone easily. Marinated overnight for the flavours to fully seep into the meat before slowcooking it for 6 hours in their in-house recipe sauce. Their stew is all different for the various meat and this is the spicy version level 1.\n<br />Steps to select your stew:\n<br />Step1: Choose stew (Beef/Chicken/Pork)\n<br />Step2: Choose flavour - Soy (for beef &amp; pork only) or Spicy (level 1 - 4)\n<br />Step3: Choose noodles - Korean udon/glass noodles\n<br />Step4: Choose optional add-on for $2each.
Either way, you get to put your hands into good use and mould into the size of balls or shapes you like. Best of all, you get to eat it! \n<br />With a choice of either Anchovy or Tuna riceballs ($8), they are served with the ingredients and you have to put on the gloves, mixed them well and conjure into riceballs (or any shapes, subject to your creativity).\n<br />And this is how you roll in the deep. I enjoyed the crispy anchovies that provided the extra crunch to every bite, and the rice were made of three mixed grains – medium-grain white rice, stained purple from Korean black rice and Barley.\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
We tried the Pork Rib Stew in Soy Sauce ($16 individual; $29 double) - served in cast-iron pots and heated up with flames to ensure consistent hotness. \n<br />The Australian mixed pork ribs were incredibly tender and well marinated with the sweet soy sauce, which also encompassed Korean pears and apples as part of the marination. \n<br />In fact, we couldn’t help but to drink the stew that was so appetizing\n<br />You can choose between Soy Sauce flavour (only for pork and beef) for non-spicy lovers as well as 4 levels of spiciness (pork, beef and chicken) for those who can accept spicy food! \n<br />All stews are added with either Korean glass noodles or udon to provide additional texture other than meat.\n<br />Thank you @sixthsensepr and @rachelxie for the hosted meal, and @thechoyalicious for extending the invitation to me! \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
This pot of beef rib stew is chock full with Australian beef short ribs that are marinated overnight, then slow cooked for 6 hours in Masizzim\'s secret recipe sauce. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and the sauce is just divine to drizzle over rice to eat with, not forgetting those delicious Korean glass noodles in the stew too!
coming in a bowl, you\'ll get to put your gloves, mix the dish and roll up your balls. after which you pop them into ur mouth.
It comes in either Anchovy or Tuna. \n<br />Medium grain white rice, Korean black rice, barley, seaweed crumbs and crushed chili padi. \n<br />You get to mix all the ingredients together and mould it into a rice ball and pop in into your mouth. I love the Anchovy one and definitely gonna order that everytime I\'m there. \n<br />Thank you @rachelxie for the invite. 😊
It is brought to you by the same folks who debuted popular Korean fries chicken chain Chir Chir Fusion Chicken Factory, serving up their signature stews, mix grain rice balls, savoury pancakes and more.
Still a comforting meal. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/10/25/masizzim/

Maybe I should wish that I will never run out of cheeses to eat in my life for my birthday wish 😂 This kimchi pancake hit my taste palettes on all the right notes with its cheese, spicy kimchi, tangy tomato and crispy sides. #burpple  Thank you @ctwy and @sarahthz for yesterday night! 😘
Had a ball of a time with my girl rolling these anchovy rice balls! Not too sure what mystery sauces went into the rice, but experience of mixing it up adds to the whole fun of eating. The resulting texture was a solid, sticky, chewy ball of rice, peppered with tons of crispy anchovies and seaweed! My friend and I (both crazy noodle lovers) greatly enjoyed this bowl of balls!
The chunks of beef ribs were flavourful, having been slow-cooked on their in-house specialty sauce. Also had the Tuna Rice Ball! I rarely eat rice, but this is so worth it :)
Essentially a feisty chilli padi-ikan bilis rice experience, with the mucky fun of sculpting and playing with balls - you get served a big bowlful of rice with gloves to do as you please - absolutely on the house. 3.8/5
Get your hands dirty, or not really since you\'ll be given hand gloves, and make your own rice balls! The anchovy version (pictured) has brown rice topped with anchovies, seaweed and crushed chilli padi. The salted anchovies were really crunchy and adds flavor to the otherwise plain tasting rice balls. The tuna version has tuna, kimchi and seaweed. The sour and spicy kimchi makes the tuna rice ball so additive! The idea of these cute little rice balls made me forget that they\'re carbs and I was busy popping them into my mouth till I was so stuffed. At the end of the meal, I\'m still so torn between both flavors as both are equally delicious! 
Only the spicy (level 1 to 4) version is available for the chicken stew. I love all things spice and I found level 2 to be quite spicy! Go for the level 1 if you just want to spice things up, level 2 if you enjoy spicy food and level 3/4 if you want the spicy kick! The meat is from various part of the chicken and was quite tender apart from the breast which was slightly dry. We chose the udon for this and it\'s somewhat similar to pasta. There was also carrot, potato and toppoki inside the stew. When the sauce thickens towards the end, it reminds me of the same sauce as the usual Korean spicy stir fry chicken/pork! Massiseoyo! 
Soy (spicy version is also available) beef ribs stew with glass noodles &amp; you can opt to change the brown rice to the tuna/anchovy rice balls at an additional $6 (ala carte at $8). The fork tender beef short ribs have absorbed all the sweetness from the soy based soup. As it is served over a fire, it was extra comforting to slurp down the piping hot goodness while it slowly thickens to a more cloudy texture. 
A dish that caught our attention was Rice balls, whereby you can make your own. Two flavours available: tuna or anchovy, we decided to go with the latter. You\'ll have to first mix anchovy, white rice, seafood crumbs and crushed chilli padi before rolling into the rice balls. Crispy but salty anchovies goes well with the plain white rice. Overall it was a fun experience!!
Fried kimchi and minced beef-infused batter slathered with tomato paste and topped with gooey mozzarella and flecks of basil. \n<br />Damn, this is the real cheesy deal. 🧀 More details on jacqsowhat.com, link in bio.
Choose between the more slippery, moist Tuna flavoured rice with kimchi bits – or – go for the more textured, crisp Anchovy flavoured rice and have fun rolling them into balls (or any shape you see fit). These are actually really flavourful in the mouth, my pick would be the Anchovy flavour.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#MasizzimSG #RiceBall
Spicy chicken stew from #masizzimsg, to be precise.\n<br />•\n<br />Assorted chicken parts marinated overnight, then slow cooked for 6 hours in Masizzim\'s secret recipe sauce, resulting in fall-off-the-bone tender meat. My kind of #comfortfood
It\'s so tasty! This is level 3 spiciness, they\'ve got up till 4. A pity they ran out of spicy noodles! Was hoping to try that.  #masizzim #koreanfoodagain #313somerset #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgfood
Out of the different Korean stews from the recently opened Masizzim, the spicy Australian beef rib stew ($18/32++) was my favourite.
This is a fun dish to have, and you have to ‘work’ for it.
When you taste the stew on its own, powdery ashes float lazily in the wind and land ever so gently and quietly on your tongue, and you will dismiss these innocuous-seeming embers, but seconds later they register with white-hot intensity. 3.7/5\n<br />.\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Masizzim Singapore.
Waited an hour for this egg but I was partially appeased (partially only because one hour is so looooooong; the table next to us ended cancelling the order) when I dug in to this fluffy eggy goodness. The flavour of the stock used was soaked in every little bit and the egg that was stuck to the bowl was damn shiok. ($6). 
($18 for 1 portion), comes with rice and choice of noodles /udon, and you get to select the level of spiciness (1-4 or just soy). The stew is really tasty but the beef ribs weren\'t as tender as I had expected. Might be my low tolerance for spicy food, I can\'t imagine how level 4 is like. Addictive though! While food is good, service was reaaaaaally slow. Wouldn\'t head here if I was insanely hungry. They did notify that the stew would take an hour or so, and if we would like our spicy cheese fried rice served first since the stew takes longer (they ended up serving the stew before rice anyway after almost 50 mins). What\'s worst was the steamed egg which arrived 1 hour 15 mins after we placed our order. And it wasn\'t exactly full-house. Hopefully it was just a one time thing while they smooth out their operations.
Why not!\n<br />⋅\n<br />Oh so drool-worthy Tomato Cheese Kimchi Pancake at Masizzim.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#MasizzimSG #KimchiPancake
Still dunno what to eat for dinner? Maybe you can head down to 313 to give this a try.\n<br />In frame is the DIY tuna rice ball that I made. So much fun trying to put what @littlemissbento has taught into good use. But hor I acually prefer the anchovies ones more. Hehehe. I am so missing the stews now!! Love the pork stew and beef stew. The chicken stew is too hot for me as we ordered level 4 for the spicness. Almost faint, level 4 spicness is akin to the spicness from chilli padi. The only difference is the spiciness is slowly kicked in one. 🔥🔥🔥👄👄\n<br />Check out my website tomorrow for full review.

This one pretty interesting; surprisingly light and fluffy without feeling as though it was sitting in the steamer for too long, yet absorbed the flavours of the beef stock fully. Pretty much like a Chawanmushi-meets-Soufflé thing going on in here.
One of the few modern Korean fusion dishes available here; this one sees the traditional Korean pancake with pizza infusion with familiar ingredients such as tomato and cheese. Pretty much like a starchy and stretchy version of pizza less the dough/crust.
My favourite of the lot here; a specific sauce is used for the different stews here so the flavours vary for each type of stew that they have. Meat was marinated overnight, pre-cooked before being slow-cooked into the stew again for six hours. The stew carried a sweet soy flavour, with pork that melts-in-the-mouth. Toppoki is included for a chew. This stew is also available in spicy form, with four different levels to choose from (Level 1 is of the usual Korean spiciness), and there is an option to choose between Korean Udon noodles or Glass noodles. Addition of cheese, Toppoki and additional serving of noodles comes at an extra charge. 
The fun behind this was the process; served in a bowl, there is always the lazy way of mixing it within and eating with a spoon, but just pick up those gloves and get down and dirty shaping them up. These were delicious; moist without being a slush and yet carrying a hint of seaweed flavour amidst the crispy anchovies.
The Tomato Cheese Kimchi could taste like a cross between a Korean pancake and Italian pizza, as it has minced beef-infused batter with tomato paste, AND gooey cheese mozzarella.
Korean mixed grain rice fried with spicy kimchi in a cast iron pot, and blanketed in lots of melted mozzarella. That\'s already a winning combination, but there\'s also a secret ingredient: Masizzim\'s beef rib stew sauce, which adds robustness and depth of flavour, which you don\'t get in any other kimchi fried rice around.
What better way to distinguish itself from the other Korean restaurants, with their signature stews, Beef Rib Stew, Pork Rib Stew and |\n<br />(in frame) Spicy Chicken Stew | $16 individual or $29 double portions. The spicy base is made with gochujang (red pepper paste) and there are four levels of spiciness to choose from. Beware, level 1 has got most of us feeling fiery on our tongues. But then again it\'s so addictive!
Masizzim sits right next to their sister concept, Chir Chir, at 313@Somerset. Unlike the latter, known for Korean fried chicken, Massizim focuses on both modern and traditional Korean stews that are good for groups to share. Don\'t miss the super comforting Beef Rib Stew ($18), meltingly tender after six hours of slow cooking. It also comes with a choice of either a spicy gouchujang base (with four levels of spiciness to choose from) or a soy base. While waiting for your stews to arrive, get your gloves on and have some hands on fun shaping their DIY Rice Balls ($8) that comes either with Anchovy or Tuna.
Dare to challenge this? 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I actually quite like it especially with the Korean glass noodles in it that has soaked up all the yummy gravy!😋👍🏻 Full review #ontheblog #masizzim #masizzimsg
This is like a combination of everything I love!! 😍 You could call this a cheese kimchi pizza too. 😂 Either way, I\'m loving the generous amount of mozzarella cheeseeeeee and kimchiiiiiii!😋👌🏻 #masizzim #masizzimsg
This is my favourite rib stew from @masizzimsg (open by the same people who brought you @chirchirsg)! The beef is so tender after slow-cooking for 6hours.😍 I could do with a higher level of spiciness though. But trust me, this level is good enough to kill the normals. 😏👌🏻. .\n<br />Also, do give the DIY mixed grain rice balls a try too! So much fun to put on the gloves to mix and eat your own rice balls. ☺️ #masizzimsg #masizzim
Double portion is available at S$32. ⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />How to order your stew:\n<br />➊ Choose stew (beef, chicken, pork) \n<br />➋ Choose flavour (soy, or spicy with level 1 to 4) we had level 1 for the beef and it\'s perfect! Sweet spicy balance! \n<br />➌ Choose noodles: udon or glass noodles
\"KIM-CHEESEEEEEEE\"
Ok, here\'s a proper shot of the Anchovy Rice Balls, freshly hand-squeezed by @ccher. *cue snigger* Love how fragrant these are, with lots of fried Korean anchovies to provide a crunch in contrast to the chewiness of the mixed grain rice and barley, and a healthy kick of spice from crushed chilli padi.
😝 DIY rice balls with an option of tuna or anchovy ($8). A good mix of multi grain white rice, Korean black rice, seaweed crumbs and crushed Chilli padi. Don\'t worry about getting your hands dirty as you are given plastic gloves!
Don\'t know if I should have posted this cos some people said it looks like worms. But please ah, crispy fried anchovies by any other look would taste just as good, and even better when they\'re mixed with seaweed crumbs, crushed chilli padi and three different grains (medium-grain white rice, Korean black rice and barley) a la Masizzim\'s DIY rice balls.
Still can\'t decide if I prefer my beef short ribs in the Spicy or Soy flavoured base because both are positively lipsmacking. The Spicy, made with gochujang and a special spicy sauce, has four levels to choose from, while the Soy is a veritable pot of umami goodness; a blend of soy sauce, sugar, Korean pear and pineapple.
When Korean pancake met Rosti, this piece of magic happened.
Of all the dishes at Masizzim that I loveeeeeeee, this is one of the ones I love the most. And really, is it hard to see why? Look at that cheeeeeeeeeeese!!!! The savoury jeon (Korean pancake) is fried so impeccably – crispy round the edges and across the surfaces, but chewy in the middle. Infused with piquant kimchi, the jeon is like a fusion pizza, slathered with tangy tomato paste and a copious amount of stretchy melted mozzarella.
Brought to you by the same folks who debuted @chirchirsg earlier this year, Masizzim is set to be the next big Korean thing in Singapore.

The chilled noodle is topped with Kimchi, cucumber and steamed egg. As a whole, the dish gives the delightful \"Hot and Cold\" shiokness.
I have to say the egg roll here is definitely one of the better ones out there. I wouldn\'t mind going down again just for this! 👍😋
The rice balls are so nice that they should be eaten on its own! #burpple

Have you all made plans? It\'s not a day only for lovers but also for family &amp; friends ❤️

Oooh and that egg that is cracked directly into the soup.
The rice ball roe was the best😊

My favourite 😍
Ordered beer ribs stew with spicy level 3 but I find it not really spicy but the ribs is really very tender.\n<br />Top up $8.80 to their latest crabmeat with roe rice. Texture is not bad but can\'t really taste the crabmeat.
The beer is topped with icy beer slush and drizzle of honey @masizzimsg\n<br />.\n<br />Location: @313somerset 313 Orchard Road, #B3-02, Singapore 238895\n<br />.\n<br />#masizzim #masizzimsg #koreanstew #koreanfood\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg
Every bite was so flavourful &amp; every chew was so satisfying. Definitely a YUM especially with the special sauce\n<br />[]\n<br />#burpple
Certainly no excuse not to have this beneficial concoction, with grapefruit known for its weight lost and Vitamin C, and yogurt for good digestion!
At times, the simple looking dish made from the simplest of ingredients is actually the most difficult to master. At Masizzim, they definitely got this right on point. Not only did they get the flavours right, the pulling of the melting mozzarella and cheddar cheese creates a perfect photo opportunity.\n<br />.\n<br />Masizzim\n<br />Address: 313, Orchard Road, 313 Somerset, Unit B3-02, Singapore 238895 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood  #masizzimsg #korean #riceballs #313somerset #313foodie

The addition of the stewed beef ribs into the kimchi jjigae was just divine. It’s like the kimchi soup collected enough beef ribs candies to evolve into something even more magical (okay, I just have to bring in some Pokemon Go puns).\n<br />.\n<br />The resulting broth is a combination of spicy, sour and meaty; super comforting especially after a long day at work. The beef ribs is something that you want to slowly savour as you marvel at how easily the meat falls off the bone.\n<br />.\n<br />Masizzim\n<br />Address: 313, Orchard Road, 313 Somerset, Unit B3-02, Singapore 238895 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #masizzimsg #korean #riceballs #313somerset #313foodie

From the ever-popular Masizzim rice balls, which you can choose either the anchovy or tuna fillings, there is now a new addition to the lineup, the Crabmeat &amp; Roe Rice Ball ($10.80). This do-it-yourself concept where you have a hand in mixing the bowl of ingredients before shaping them into your desired form adds a fun element in the dining experience. With a combination of white rice, Korean black rice and barley, the grains used will definitely appeal to the health-conscious while the accompanying ingredients such as snow crab meat, ebiko, seaweed and especially the furikake that lend a hand to the flavour profile.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @masizzimsg for hosting and @rachelxie @sixthsensepr for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Masizzim\n<br />Address: 313, Orchard Road, 313 Somerset, Unit B3-02, Singapore 238895 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #masizzimsg #korean #riceballs #313somerset #313foodie #cassiehandsatwork

Went back to Masizzim (2nd day in a row 😂) and decided to get something different. Korean Cold Springy Noodles ($11) are indeed very q (i like 😋) and flavourful.

Went this place twice and food quality remained the same.Queue/food serving time might be an issue so try to reach early and order fast. Staff are quite attentive but not all are friendly and proactive. The 1st time when I ordered: Staff was proactive to tell us that we can top to get the rice ball dish. However, at my 2nd visit (I had yet to arrive when my friends ordered), I was disappointed to know that staff did not even inform my friends on the upgrade option. Sigh..cos the rice ball dish tasted awesome! I don\'t find the potato or tomato cheese pancake any fantastic but it\'s not bad. Love the steam egg, stew and rice ball!
How comforting it is to have it during a cold rainy weather.
Interesting~
Super like!! 😋😋

Added the mixed brown rice (that comes with the beef stew) and kim chi (free side dish) into this dish to increase the quantity.... not worth the $8 imo... #dinner #koreanfood #rice #foodlover #vscofood #onthetable #whati8today #food #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodporn #foodpornography #getinmybelly #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #foodpics #icapturefood #foodstamping #openricesg #burpple

Having spicy beef stew! Loved this version at Massizim, which comes with the much appreciated spicy kick. The beef is tenderly stewed over 12 hours, so long that the meat cleanly falls off the bones. The long hours of cooking also brought out the aroma of the spices, resulting in a sophisticated broth that is comforting for the soul. There are 4 levels of spiciness to choose from. @toothpickky and I got Level 3, which proved to be a bit too much for us. I think Level 2 would have been perfect. \n<br />The steamed egg was quite a disappointment for me. I found the texture to be coarse and dry. \n<br />Massizim is located at B2 of Somerset 313, right beside it\'s sister concept, Chir Chir. Nearest train station being Somerset MRT. \n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #313somerset #massizimsg #massizim #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #onthetable #tablesituation #sgfoodie

From the sweet non spicy pork ribs, to the super spicy chicken pot but my fav of the lot is the medium spiced beef short ribs which were literally falling from the bone and tenderishly adorable to the bite, hehe :)\n<br />#koreanstew #porkribs #shortribs #chicken #beef #spicy #sgfood #sgrestaurant #burpple #masizzim

Using a mix of medium grain white rice, Korean black rice, barley, seaweed crumbs, crushed chilli padi and a choice of tune or anchovy.
