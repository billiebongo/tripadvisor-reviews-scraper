Full flavoured, Lemak, distinct taste of lemongrass and spices of Tom yum sauce, drowning and coating every strand of the al dente fettuccine. Instead of cream, when associated with pasta, this dish uses coconut milk. Giving this dish a more homegrown, Asian Flavours, rather than a remake or \"inspired\" cheap-thrill which I personally detest. Come with clams, and squid and a singular prawn, at a price of $10.80 (comes with a can of drink). This wallet friendly, house favourite certainly give the Long standing 49seats a run for their money. Their attention to details, and attention to any of the customers surely make any visit heartwarming, and endearing. It is like visiting an old friend. \n<br />Heads up to all Muslim friends, this is a halal certified place. Another great place to have great food without a worry :)
We tried the roasted chicken, salmon &amp; sambal seafood rice &amp; they taste awesome!!  Will come back to try the pasta!
Saw the menu at they seemed to have a menu revamp, so decided to try one of the new dishes out. This feels very similar to the KFC breakfast wrap for some strange reason though with the tortilla less packed and not as tightly wrapped as intended. The promised crispy chicken didn\'t fail to make the right impressions, but the tortilla was so loosely packed with small portions that works well for people with smaller appetites that the fillings just kept dropping as I tried to eat it by hand. What goes into the wrap apart from the chicken was passable at best ‚Äî lettuce and chopped tomatoes drenched in a dressing that feels like a combination of chili sauce and mayo combined for a weak spiciness with a weenzy bit of tanginess for the salad. On the side, the salad served on the side was no different from the ones served in the wrap. What boggles my mind even more was the three dollops of mayo (hidden behind the wrap and salad) that should have been dressed within the salad. True enough, it\'s the cheapest main you can get here ($9.90 and a complimentary can of soft drink of your choice comes along), but I would say it\'s better to go for the Free Range Grilled Chicken with better flavour that makes your money and time here more worth. Still, it\'s probably ok at best if one doesn\'t look into the food too much given the type of establishment it is.
This cafe is conveniently located within the grounds of Woodlands Swimming Complex, making it the perfect pit stop for a post-swim bite with your family. Warm up with the Mushroom Soup ($4.50) ‚Äî piping hot, creamy goodness made from scratch that is bound to make you feel nice and toasty. For hungry kiddos, tame their tummies with the crowd pleasing Cheese Fries ($4) while awaiting their mains. The star of the menu is the Grilled Free Range Chicken ($12.80). First sous vide, the chicken is then grilled till the skin is crisp, and it is served atop a pool of moreish housemade citrus sauce. Don\'t leave without having the popular Molten Chocolate Lava Cake with Ice Cream ($8.80). According to Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua, \"the molten chocolate lava just keeps flowing endlessly\"!\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />*Halal-certified\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
Jus a prefect food to full my tummy, \n<br />Carbonara that r full of cream make you really2 full.. but i love it\n<br /> Very reasonable price N a friendly staff makes u welcome there.. \n<br />Neighbourhood cafe jus  u need..
With the rising trend of eateries moving away from the usual malls and cafe districts, Citrus By The Pool is one such place tucked quietly in the heartlands by the Woodlands Swimming Complex (by the pool, literally). They serve up a good variety of western food with some asian fusion/selections at really affordable prices! Do try their desserts too! (For my full review, check out mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg)
By far the best dessert,  price is reasonable and wish to come back for more üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Good Cheap Fast. Indeed i can feel these three elements here. If the dishes can be hot when they served then this shall be perfect.
Must say that they do indeed serve one of the better molten chocolate lava cake not just in Woodlands, but possibly in town. No doubt the vanilla ice-cream is a tad uninspiring, but the true star of the show is indeed the molten chocolate lava cake. Warm, soft and crumbly whilst holding itself pretty firmly after being cut, the molten chocolate lava just keeps flowing endlessly. Unlike some places, the molten chocolate lava is actually pretty smooth to down, without biting the throat nor being overly sweet. It\'s such desserts that really make meals end off on a very positive note.
Seasonal Vegetables, Wild Mushrooms, Potato, Citrus Sauce. One of the signature dishes here; the chicken was really tender with its succulent meat coming off the bones with an effortless pull; the result of using the sous-vide cooking method here. The sauce works brilliantly with the chicken; seemed to be their own housemade sauce which was like a combination of a savoury, earthy mushroom sauce with a light hint of garlicky flavour with a little citrusy tang. Of course there are also room for improvement; the crunchy carrots could be boiled to achieve a softer texture to bite while they could possibly remove the corn nibs for some mash; maybe I am just not a fan of that. However, at $12.80 this is pretty much decent, and definitely a spot that is worthy to check out with your Muslim friends for those living in Woodlands as they are Halal-certified!
With the price, the portion of the waffle is definitely for sharing.
It seems like the catch is always the salmon. The sauce split so there is room for improvement. Kudos for removing the skin as eating it soggy is a no-no.
Affordable halal bistro that brings another option at the northern side. Given the price,  I do not have complains on the portion but definitely quality can be improved.
Perfect for 1 person, the cake melts in the mouth. Definitely worth the try. The place is Halal! üéâ
The oozing chocolate flowing out of the lava cake ! Mix the taste with an additional Vanilla ice cream feel the sweetness in your mouth !  Price are reasons only at $8.80!
The main and sides you must order to try. Must! No regrets and that\'s a promise! Always my order whenever I\'m here!
