The massive mound of food I end up with at every visit to Grain Traders. They\'re always so generous with the portions, I\'m usually struggling to finish it ‚Äî but hey, more\'s always better than less eh. Portion aside, the quality and quantity of ingredients offered at GT is, I feel, superior to anywhere else latching onto this rice bowl trend. The salmon\'s sous-vide then seared, pork\'s slow-roasted for hours, and salad comes with loads of kale, for example  ‚Äî the quality of each ingredient is of utmost importance, and we get all these premium options with no extra charge! At an average of $16 per bowl, it\'s way tastier, way more worth-the-buck, and possibly even cheaper than its peers.
Grain Trader\'s Bowl ($16). Pico de gallo beans, warm roasted beets and carrots, wafuk tomatoes, and seared marinated tuna with furikake sprinkled. Round off with tamarind chipotle sauce that is tangy and savoury in one. \n<br />Delish though not cheap ($16) if only I can have the best of both worlds with a mixed base 
Mix your own bowl for only $16! Choose 1 protein, 1 grains, 1 hot veg, 2 cold vegs, toppings &amp; a sauce! Super healthy &amp; worthy meal! Will return for more! @graintraders #graintraders #salmon #healthy #healthymeal
Come lunch time, Grain Traders at Capita Green is not spared from the CBD crowd despite its $16 price tag on its healthy grain bowls. Split responsibilities and let your friend queue at the food counter, while you head for the less busy coffee counter for your java fix. The Flat White ($5.50) is great for a daily boost ‚Äî the coffee is smooth, with a nutty hint, but it is the White Cold Brew ($7.50) that you cannot miss. The chilled, velvety smooth concoction is the most balanced white cold brew we\'ve tried so far. Such a delight before taking on the rest of the work day!
Not the cheapest of greens in cbd area, but definitely one of the better quality ones. This was $16. 
I love love love grains. Healthy and yummy food served with a bed of mixed vegs- consisting of wild mushrooms, salmon, miso caramel, roasted peppers and bean sprout
$16. Delicious, though a tad too much quinoa. Pretty hearty portions but decently flavorful. Would visit again. 
I cannot remember how much my dish was, but boy was it good üëÖüëÖüëÖ if I remember correctly, there was kale, salmon, mushrooms, nuts, a kind of slaw, bean sprouts and a coconut curry sauce yum yum so much flavor in every bite and the portion was rather big (if it is not filling enough you can always change the kale to a carb - eg. soba/quinoa/brown rice, there are just so many ingredients to choose from :-) anyone who is looking to eat healthy should stop by this place for their next meal!!!
gorgeous store concept &amp; really fun system of choosing ingredients!! the build-your-own-bowl ($16) = 1 grain + 1 protein + 1 hot veg + 2 cold veg + 1 sauce + 1 topping. the seared marinated tuna was especially outstanding, so flavourful and tender! beetroot yogurt sauce was a pretty pink and pretty tasty too. all-in-all, a satisfying and feel-good lunch :-)
The Beebop ($16) is one of the six Hero Bowls you can choose from, if unsure what to go for. Juicy yet tender braised pork shoulder comes together with selections of furikake corn, crudit√©s slaw and mixed beans pick de gallo on brown grain rice. Satisfactory meal!!
Customised bowl with quinoa, grilled steak, bean sprouts, coleslaw, mushrooms, and Japanese flakes
Salad bowl with grilled salmon and an additional portion of pulled pork. Fulfilling! 
Generous serving with a base of sushi rice with striploin sous vide, charred vegetables, wafu tomato and bean sprouts salad. They serve fixed combos and do mix and match with different bases, proteins, vegs, toppings and sauce; so much so to the extent this take-away looks like a atas cafe-style \"chup chye peng\". At $16 its economic rice, not so economic (not complaining... )
Luckily we managed to hit this place before the crowd comes in at 12pm. Featuring here are our Hero Bowls ($16): The Beebop and Rooster\'s Crow
From the boys behind Kilo comes this four-month-old venture that has been well-received by the Shentoners (can we call you that?). Located at the new CapitaGreen building, this high-ceilinged, concrete-floored space is abuzz with excitement come lunch time despite the price tag on these bowls. The menu is simple ‚Äî pick from any six of the aforethought Hero bowls ($16) like El Hibaro, a combination of warm striploin steak, lightly charred vegetables, wafu tomatoes and salsa verde on a bed of sushi rice. Alternatively, customise your own bowl and go for the char-grilled salmon, tuna or the flavour-packed pulled pork from the proteins, and don\'t miss the wild mushrooms from the hot veg. Of the sauces, the Miso Caramel and the Beetroot Feta Yoghurt are simply irresistible. Go easy on the grains here, portions are generous and they fill you up even before you start to dig into the rest of the bowl. Come with a lunch buddy and split up ‚Äî one to snag a seat and one to order. Otherwise, be prepared to dig into your bowls at the alfresco standing bar. For maximum effect, add a dash of the chili flakes and chili padi found next to the utensils before digging in! p.s. Do try their White Cold Brew ($7.50) before you go!
$16 always worth. My favourite place to splurge on wholesome clean food. 
Everyone knows Grain Traders for their grain bowls which are good, but they also do serve simple cakes like this one to pair up with coffee; pretty apt for tea breaks in the CBD. Doused in a sugary sweet layer of glaze, the muffin comes in a shape more towards a mini loaf than the conventional muffin. It is significantly less greasy, while perfumed with orange flavours throughout the adequately dense cake with pulpy bits to chew on. Rose petal does help to give it a flowery aroma, though some bits were a tad hard and can\'t be chewed on. Will be back to try their breakfast menu, which carries different items such as Bagels and Porridges that is only available from 8am to 10.30am.
The folks at Grain Traders allow you to pick your grains (Japanese rice, brown rice &amp; quinoa etc), proteins (chicken, beef, salmon etc), veggies, topping and sauces. \n<br />It might be a little pricey but trust me, it is worth your every penny. Besides, wholesome food is worth paying for! \n<br />My dining partner and I tried the salmon bowl, as well as the grilled strip loin bowl. The bowls are filling with a generous serving of  ingredients. For those who haven\'t been there, it\'s located at 138 Market Street, Capitagreen building. \n<br />This will be my submission for HerWorld Plus social media award\'s clean food category. As I have been selected for one of the finalist for the food category, I feel grateful for the nomination and selection.
I went for a Jap/Korean flavor bowl with soba noodles, pan seared tuna, butternut squash &amp; sweet potatoes, wafu tomatoes &amp; kimchi apples with a sprinkle of furikake! üòã Though on the higher end of the pricing radar, this bowl kept me full for longer period of time &amp; stopped me from snacking the whole afternoon! Just in time to lose some pounds for Christmas &amp; weddings next year! ‚ò∫Ô∏è @naiise \n<br />#feedingpeopleright #burpple #aroundwithamd
definitely one of the best salads I\'ve ever eaten! Build your own salad for $16nett, where you can choose 1 grain, 1 protein, 1 hot veg, 2 cold veg, 1 topping and 1 sauce. Protein selection included premium meats like steak and seared tuna, and there was a plethora of choices for everything! The fun was in the choosing as much as the eating. So so good. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
I finished this beautiful bowl of healthy food so quickly before I realized that I did not use the miso caramel sauce (I chose it) provided at all. The slaw sounded promising with a kaffir lime vinaigrette but was mostly tasteless. But the wadi tomatoes and wild mushrooms were crazy tasty! \n<br />And. That. Piece. Of. Salmon. OMG. Sous vide to perfection, finished on a pan for that crispy crust. I have not enjoyed salmon like that in a long time. \n<br />I also had the banana cake (not pictured) which made my brain go crazy with bliss. I can count the number of banana cakes I have eaten that have made me feel this way, with one hand. \n<br />I totally need to head back to @graintraders for more! Whoever said healthy food was boring?!! #graintraders #burpple
For $16 nett, I had the green tea soba noodles as the base, roasted chicken, charred baby corn, wafu tomatoes, bean sprouts, furikake toppings and Asian dressing. Liked that the dressing came in a small bowl at the side and not drizzled over. But not a huge fan of the dressing. And also, the protein options left at dinner time were only pulled pork and the chicken, so quite a miserable selection. Wanted to try the seared tuna but oh wells. üòû For the price, felt that there could have been more to the dish. Or maybe I just had higher expectations?
The signature bowls were tempting but I decided to just pick my own ingredients. The quinoa was cooked perfectly üëåüèª I\'ll skip the baby corn next time, but the marinated peppers were tangy and delish, and the beansprout salad was good too. Good enough to eat on its own, but the miso caramel sauce... Yum. Seriously addicted to miso caramel. 
slightly pricey (16$) but I promise this is worth every single cent and it keeps you very very full mm the \'protein\' portion is really huge and they have quite a wide variety so it\'s good for anyone picky haha the serving is really quite big so it can be shared but if you\'re hungry JUST HAVE ONE TO YOURSELF unlike normal salad bowls it\'s not too bland and neither is it drenched in sauce because they serve the dressing separately in a tiny box so you get to choose how much u want!! I got the slow roasted pork with super greens bed here the pork is tender and seasoned nicely!! the greens have a slight bitter after taste tho so.... if you\'re not a fan then opt for another \'grain\' 
I was very impressed with the tender striploin steak that I had with roasted butternut squash and sweet potato, beansprouts, baby tomatoes and a coconut curry sauce. Curry sauce was light but spicy! Would definitely come here again, very satisfying.
Been excited about this place since I saw the coming soon sign. Finally got a chance to visit this spacious caf√© in the heart of CBD. Loved the Olive Rose Petal Muffin ($5.5) but wish the coffee was a little stronger. I am going to visit this friendly cafe again at the earliest.
Even editing it makes me really hungry üòÇüòÇüòÇ What I had was a bed of salad greens topped with a generous portion of striploin steak, wild mushrooms, apple kimchi and a side of wafu-infused cherry tomatoes. The unfortunate brown Miso Caramel sauce that didn\'t make it into the picture turned out to be THE BEST PART of the meal. The taste is unlike anything I\'ve had before and it\'s truly unforgettable!! Makes your eyebrows go like this üòå when you first taste it hehehe #burpple

White Cold Brew ($7.50) - saw this on the coffee menu and just have to get it! And happy to say, I\'m not disappointed! Not the strongest kind of coffee but the smooth texture makes it really easy to drink.
($16 - 1 grain, 1 protein, 1 hot veg, 2 cold veg, 1 sauce and 1 topping) yes, not really cheap but I felt it was really worth it! \n<br />My choice was brown rice, sous vide pan grilled salmon, furikake corn, bean spouts, cherry tomatoes, furikake and the surprisingly good Beet Root Feta Yoghurt sauce!!! I really loved the grilled baby corn üòç and I\'m so happy with the generous helping of it!
Honestly, I think this is about as good as it gets if you\'re looking for a tasty, fresh, healthy and uber filling breakfast in the CBD. Filled with a generous heap of mixed bean pico de gallo, two polenta cakes smeared with guac and topped with two perfectly boiled eggs, and salsa verde. All at just $8. So much more worth it than their lunch bowls. If this doesn\'t make your belly stuffed and happy in the morning, then you\'re just plain difficult. 
It sounds pricey at $16, but with the amount and quality of ingredients available, it\'s a huge steal. The generous portion of quinoa is about twice of what I usually get elsewhere. At first I thought the meat portion was a tad small, though after the addition of hot vege (yummy roasted sweet potatoes and squash) and cold veges (beans and coleslaw), the meal turned out to be very satisfying. Of all the healthy food (including the delivery types) options in the current market, Grain Traders is now one of my favourites.
So awesome to try this place out! Slightly price at 16 bucks but really fresh and great taste. Will definitely be back soon ;) 
You create your own rice bowl by choosing rise, main dish, salad and toppings. I am pretty sure that you can take as many varieties of food as you need per day.
A twist made to the typical salad to complement our local tastebuds. Easily build your bowl for only $16 nett. Start off with your healthy base followed by hot &amp; cold veggies, proteins, toppings and sealed it with sauce of your choice! In love with their thick slices of seared tuna, crunchy bean sprout salad and apple kimchi. Each being so flavorful with different mouthfeel, enticing us not just visually but also our sensory! In fact the bowl taste good even on its own without any sauce! 
A perfect bowl of flavours is completed with a light snack(cake) or fruit and a bottle of water when you order the Square Meal at Grain Traders. Lunch time was a busy sight and even with 3 shop spaces, many had to dine and stand at the tables located outside the store or chose to take-away instead.
üòç colourful lunch box that\'s a feast for the eyes and really yummy too! Everything\'s really good but the faves got to be the mushrooms &amp; the salmon. 
This place is loved by many who make it a point to eat clean at least once (or daily) in their lives. The cheapest salad is $16 but worth every cent. Quality proteins with equally delicious sides. My favorite is the \"beebop\", which includes braised pulled pork shoulder, pico de gallo, crudites slaw, and furikake corn.
Back again! Love the salads here ‚ù§Ô∏è 
a mess i know but somewhat quinoa beautiful too. dug up the seared tuna to bring to your attention because it is searmazing. must come back a second time to build another bowl man
For those not familiar with it, it belongs to the same species as jackfruit. Strong in flavours, we enjoyed the pound cake but the rather overwhelming scent may not go well with everyone just like durians. Yet to try their lunch menu but having read all the glorious reviews out there, seems about time!
Happy, healthy Monday lunch earlier today with a üêµ and 2üêº. Thank you, boys for queuing! The lunch crowd is pretty intense between 12-1pm, so definitely come after then if you don\'t want to jostle and be jostled.
Very filling and very delicious. It\'s quite pricey at S$16 but worth every cent because it\'s healthy AND tasty AND will you keep you full till late dinner. Two thumbs up!
Premium selection of meats and vegetables. Power lunch in raffles place. üí™üèªüí™üèª
I am becoming a frequent customer of this rice bowl shop whose motto is \'feeding people right\'. 
Pay up, mix your grains and eat it. This is Grain Traders.
Shall eat these bagels for brunch before the lunch crowd starts swarming in!
Three weeks ago, we attended Grain &amp; Traders\' friends and family launch, and we were sold. The concept revolves around quick fix healthy bowls that are nutritious and delicious. Pictured here is Mr. Pirom: seared tuna, wild mushrooms, apple kimchi, crudit√©s slaw, and cha soba noodles. 
Create your very own pretty bowl of lunch with 1 Grain, 1 Protein, 1 Hot Veggie, 2 Cold Veggies, 1 Sauce and 1 Topping. You should have a rough idea of what you want, otherwise you\'ll be dumbfounded with that array of ingredients greeting you at their counter! I had the striploin steak with soba noodles, topped with furikake corn, wafu tomatoes, apple kimchi, seeds mix and miso caramel sauce. I enjoyed every single component of this bowl except that I couldn\'t really pair my sauce with it but that didn\'t matter when the ingredients each excelled in their own ways! 
Roast chicken, tender capsicums, and a basil vinaigrette that tastes as good as it looks.
After 5 visits just the past week, I\'ve decided their Build Your Bowl option (S$16) is the best. Cause while the pre-designed Hero Bowls of the same price are more hassle-free, there\'s always something I\'d find missing - especially since I customised my own bowl on the first visit. It\'s either too bland, too sweet, not creamy enough, etc.; there\'s always something short of perfect. So I deduced, build your own bowl. Then you\'d get your favourite combination of the best ingredients.
Being the last one on the shelf, this Summer Berries Crumble ($5.50) proved to be a popular and great choice to get! The raspberries and the fruits mixed very well with the sweet crumble, which is crisp and flaky!
Time for some coffee! The Flat White ($5.50) here is both strong and white, being quick for a perk-me-up!
Something similar to Old Hen Coffee Bar\'s version but cutting off the sweetness. Perhaps those who find that version too sweet would like this one better.
Here, the concept of salad bowls are pretty fun because apart from having suggested combinations of ingredients, you get to choose and pick whatever you fancy with very hip and cool stuff that\'s unlike most salad bars. My choice of ingredients were Quinoa, Grilled Striploin Steak, Furikake, Wild Mushrooms, Apple Kimchi, Bean Sprout Salad and Asian Gravy; a combination which I only realized after ordering that was very Chinese/Japanese/Korean. Quinoa was soft, fluffy but they could have done better in the processing of it for there were parts of it which were sandy and gritty, spoiling the texture of the salad. Grilled Striploin Steak is well-grilled, tender but a little gamey (though not disturbing) with a little fat around the corners to chew. Wild Mushrooms were earthy and flavourful, while the Apple Kimchi felt really unique for how it delivered that familiar fermented yet spicy flavour but introduced a juicy, sweet crunchiness. Bean Sprout Salad is served cold, crunchy with a bit of savoury and the Asian gravy was somewhat like a caramalised onion sauce with a hint of vinegar which is sweet yet tangy. Furikake adds spiciness and umami flavours to the dish. All in all this was a salad bowl I enjoyed thoroughly, and it\'s not only because it\'s a combination of ingredients I personally enjoy and hand picked, but their ingredients are rather quality choices which are different and rather unconventional of usual salad outfits in the area.
From the guys behind Kilo, the mix-and-match ($16) to create your own hearty affair works pretty well for me. Choose from a selection of proteins, hot veg, cold veg, topping and staples, you stole my heart and definitely I will be back for more. üòçüòçüòç\n<br />In frame:\n<br />Striploin steak,\n<br />Cucumber pickles,\n<br />Apple kimchi,\n<br />Wild mushroom, \n<br />Quinoa &amp; mix nuts topping.
Not pictured is the lovely bright pink beetroot yoghurt sauce that is nice and creamy when mixed with the bulgar. Really enjoyed the pulled pork + mushroom combo, not a huge fan of the wafu tomatoes and the kimchi apple, though both were decent. Loved the warm beetroot and carrot option! Paid an extra $2 for my mushrooms cos I wanted 2 hot veg. Wish we had a choice of 3 veg either hot or cold, and not 1 warm and 2 cold. Also loved the mint garnish. Coffees both cold brew and hot were more than decent! Tip: there\'s chili flakes and chili padi next to the utensils. The chili padi worked wonders with my pork + bulgar :)
Cold brew ($7.50) - strong, smooth, just the right thing to start my day. (I looked like an alcoholic holding a beer bottle early at work though) Enjoyed this but it\'s much pricier than the other cold brews I\'ve tried.
Think of this as an upmarket and globalised version of the humble \"chap chye png\". A few steps was all it took for me to get a customised bowl of well-balanced, healthy goodness. \n<br />My order of 1 grain, 1 protein, 1 hot veg, 2 cold veg, 1 topping and 1 sauce comprised of the following:\n<br />- Brown Rice: Thumbs up for its chewy nuttiness.\n<br />- Sirloin Steak: Portion was small and the meat didn\'t wow me unfortunately. I think I will try either the Pork or Tuna next time.\n<br />- Crunchy Green Medley: The mix of asparagus, broccoli, edamame and snap peas was awesome.\n<br />- Marinated Peppers: Another satisfying choice as the capsicums were sweet and soft.\n<br />- Wafu Tomato: This turned out to be a little on the tart side, so I don\'t think I would get this again.\n<br />- Furikake: The seaweed and sesame mix added fragrance which is a positive thing.\n<br />- Salsa Verde: I selected this because of the beef and found its herbal flavour went well with most of the other items in my bowl. Greedy me also forked out an extra 50 cents for the Beet Feta Yogurt sauce (it\'s the bright pink one in my pic) as I wanted to give it a try. It didn\'t disappoint.
So much goodness stuffed into a bowl! It sure hit the spot for me. At $16 nett, you get to choose 1 base, 1 protein, 1 hot veg, 2 cold veg, 1 topping, 1 dressing. Always love a bowl of wholesome goodness! Kudos to feeding people right :)
It would\'ve been easier to say rice bowls since the concept\'s exactly the same - except there isn\'t always rice. Going by the philosophy of wholesome and delicious foods, Grain Traders offers a variety of options to go with your food bowls. From the usual rice to uncommon bulgur wheat as mains, lentil cakes to steak for proteins, the combinations are endless! And it\'s sooooo delicious too. I\'ve been there twice already and I\'m declaring them my current fave spot for lunch in the CBD.
$4, not too pricey for its size. Loved the idea, but the taste was pretty normal. Nothing pumpkin-y about it. The little dollop of cream on it was a good save though
i guess you could say that they serve an atas ËèúË¥©.  while you can choose from their signature bowls, i decided to go for their build-your-own bowl option. say \"yes\" to your right to eat whatever you want! anyway, i got myself a lovely bowl of quinoa with slow roasted pork, grilled striploin (this was kinda dry and tough tho so you can probably do without it), bean sprout salad, wafu tomatoes and wild mushrooms. salsa verde sauce on the side and sprinkled furikake made it all rather perfect. for a grand total of $18, just $2 more than the price of just getting a build-your-own, you get to choose a drink and a snack as well. i can\'t wait to make my next visit so that i can try all the other dishes! ( Àò⁄°Àò ) #burpple
Right opposite my workplace for a quick perk-me-up, happy Friday! ($5.50, with a loyalty programme and very friendly staff!) Pastries at the counter looks really good. I got myself a pumpkin with Japanese cucumber cake, and was eyeing the chempedak crumble although I don\'t have very fond memories of chempedak.
Now offering wholesome, healthy meals for office yuppies is Grain Traders, a concept from the folks behind Kilo and Kilo at Pact. Early birds can get to enjoy their hearty breakfast bagels, such as the Guacamole BLT ($10) and \"Kilo Style\" Wasabi Tuna Tartare with Avocado ($10) from 8.00am to 10.30am. Salad-lovers can go for either their pre-selected Signature Bowls ($16) or the Build-Your-Own-Bowl ($16) which allows you to choose from an extensive range of grains, proteins, toppings, hot/cold veggies and sauce to create your personal mix (we would recommend the Tamarind Chipotle Vinaigrette which gives the salad bowl a tangy Asian twist).
Trying a new place for lunch! Bulgur wheat, sous vide salmon, grilled beets &amp; carrots, apple kimchi, crudit√©s &amp; coleslaw, furikake topping with wasabi dressing so rare to be able to find bulgur wheat in SG! Flavorful bowl but wished the coleslaw was better seasoned &amp; they\'ve been a little more generous with the protein portions
As their name implies, expect to see an assortment of grains, veg and bagels!
All my favorite salad food in it. Salmon, sweet potato, bean sprouts and wasabi dressing to top it off. #burpple
When you take away the funky hashtags and hipster bistro vibe, you\'ve really got nothing but your food to answer for you. And thankfully Grain Traders lives up to the hype. Good grub, great service and hearty meals in busy CBD.

The portion of the Salmon Bowl ($16) is rather generous and substantial.
#üòÇ Didn\'t know eating healthy could be this tasty!! #nomnomnom
I really enjoyed it but then can be painful to the pocket if I am to eat this everyday.
Looks a lot smaller compared to the pictures that I\'ve seen. Taste wise, it\'s pretty healthy with minimal grease and there\'s kale in a salad which is super dope. But of course, all that comes at a price premium. Don\'t bother adding an extra serving of protein because the portions are dismal. \n<br />HTW: 3.5 / 4 / 3.5\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #burppleSG #burppletastemaker #cafehopping #localcafes #sgfood #instafood #sgfoodies #sgcafe #eatoutsg #openricesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #cafehoppingsg #exploresingapore #tablesituation #cafefood #SGmakandiary #foodhunter #foodstagram #healthygains #eatsalad #healthyfoodsg #eatclean #thegrowingbelly #graintraders #heartytastyworthy #CBDfinds #officeeats

$16 of wholesome goodness. Never bored. 
Delicious! Can\'t imagine eating a $16 meal daily, but I\'m glad I don\'t have to. Thus was a DIY bowl; quinoa was plentiful, but they ran out of steak &amp; salmon so that was a bummer. Miso caramel sauce was excellent although I probably shouldn\'t have poured everything inside (too much haha).
üçõ
I had Quinoa, Seared Tuna, Beetroot, Roast Beef, Edamame. Healthy and delicious - I do see now why the perpetually long queues. For full review on Grain Traders, head over to my blog now (click on active link in bio)
Tasty enough, and reasonably-priced at SGD$18.00 (+$3 for extra protein) - but I am not sure if I would queue 20 minutes for it.... Sitting at the front made me feel like an exhibit whenever passerbys peered in, but I got plenty of eye candies all the same too... have a lovely #TGIF u dears
@graintraders is another of my favorite cafes around #rafflesplace ‚ù§Ô∏è
One of the bestest salad bowls I\'ve ever eaten. Salmon was cooked so puurfectly and the wild mushrooms tho a tad salty was delish! Try the furikake topping too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n<br />.\n<br />#angmohcaipng #burpple #cafes #cleaneating #cleaneats #delish #eatout #eatclean #eathealthy #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodspotting #graintraders #healthychoices #instadaily #instafood #instayum #igsgfoodies #nomnnomnom #mixeatlove #onthetable #openrice #potd #sgfood #tslmakan #vscosg #vscofood #whati8today #yummyinmytummy
My Upstream bowl: Wasabi salmon wth Chilli Furikake, butternut squash, sweet potato, homemade cucumber pickles, and lots of super greens like kale
Delicious! 
3 wholesome bowls and 3 happy bellies.

loved it ‚ô° 
A bowl cost $16 but if u add $2..u get a drink and a pkt of chips. One can custom make your own bowl. Tasted quite good but i feel it is abit pricey for a small bowl.

I felt like a goat eating this very healthy lunch from the newly opened Grain Traders. At $16nett this was pricey. But the salmon was good - seared to perfection, with butternut squash, cubes of well-seasoned sweet potatoes, sprouts and cucumber pickles. Hated the greens because of the onions, although the occasional lemongrass taste (?!) was a nice surprise. 
Yummy salad at Capita Green!
