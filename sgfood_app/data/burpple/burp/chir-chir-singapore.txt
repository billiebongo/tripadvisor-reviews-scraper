Chir Chir’s new curry fried chicken was a massive hit with all the Tastemakers there, with its ultra crunchy batter, juicy meat, and its tremendous tastiness.
Chir Chir’s cheesy dakgalbi is manageably spicy due to the deluge of melted cheese bubbling on the hot plate. That sexy melted cheese was eagerly used by us to cocoon the tender, spicy chicken chunks and the chewy tteokboki (Korean rice cake).
Chir Chir has a buncha new items on their menu and it’s hard to pick favorites. This dakgalbi seems to put together all the things I like – cheesey, spicy (it seriously packs a kick) and topokki with tender chicken! Would definitely recommend having this with an ice cold beer for a #treatyoself day. 😛
A refreshing blend of pineapple, coconut and strawberry, this smoothie went well with our meal and especially good in calming down the heat from the spicier dishes. Wasn’t too sweet either! One jug is good for about 3-4 pax.
Roasted chicken thigh, spicy dakgalbi sauce and chewy topokki that perfectly completed this dish. Slightly spicy and for those who can\'t take spicy, dive right into their Soy Dakgalbi that comes with super yummy korean rice  and seaweed mixed with flying fish roe and sesame oil. Part of the new items rolling out this Friday. Yup, you gotta wait till this Friday to have this melted cheesy dish.\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, really can\'t get enough of Ed Sheeran\'s concert. Even the radio is playing an hour of his songs which brings me back to last Saturday! And Luav was splendid in his opening act too.\n<br />.\n<br />#chirchirsg #cheese #sixthsensepr #dakgalbi
Best enjoyed with friends as the portion is quite big (I ate it with 2 other friends). Mac and cheese is a must try, same as the soy sauce chicken 💁🏻
Had a fried chicken craving and so here we are. The garlicky chicken is an all time favorite for us but the original crispy chicken is not to be missed too!
•\n<br />Really enjoyed the different combinations of flavors and textures but that being said I think I\'ll just stick to the classic fried chicken the next time. 🙃\n<br />•\n<br />Pity that the overall dining experience was let down by subpar service 😒
Garlicky Boneless Chicken [$26.90], Chir Cheese Fries [$9.90]. Love the Garlicky Chicken, but portion is kinda too much for 2 pax.
Always loving this Honey Butter Chicken ($28.90)! Crispy boneless fried chicken chunks, potato wedges and rice cakes tossed with honey butter sauce and seasoning. Their fried chicken were super crispy and tasty, a must try whenever you are there! 😋
Yummiest dish of the night! It has chicken in 2 flavours, fried rice cake, potato wedges and lots of almond flakes. The dish can do without the wedges but oh wells I\'d wish we can substitute all the wedges with the rice cakes because they were so awesome. The rice cake is crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Heaven. And the garlic chicken is yummy too 😬
Boneless chicken chunks, crisp outside, tender and juicy inside. Tossed with rice cakes and potato wedges in sugar and honey.
Food hunter on the go~ Spicy Korean chicken wings with sweet potatoes and rice cakes... Yum! 
Featuring Garlicky Fried Chicken ($28.90). Crispy fried chicken in special soy sauce topped with crunchy garlic flakes. There was a nice aroma to this dish. The garlic sauce goes perfectly well with the crispy chicken. We cleared it easily, even the garlic cloves as it was so tasty. Eat with your hands to enjoy this delicious mess. 😉————————————————————————\n<br />Find out more\n<br />http://wp.me/p73MHP-8w or\n<br />https://peanutloti.wordpress.com\n<br />————————————————————————
This place is definitely meant for sharing. We ordered the Nest Snow and Honey Butter Chicken.\n<br />The Nest Snow was pretty much chicken tenders stacked over mash potato, topped with whipped cream (which sounded weird to me), paired with some béchamel sauce and some (tiny) vege chunks. This dish was actually not bad, the sauce wasn\'t too rich and had a hint of spice to it. The chicken tenders were crispy but not dry, and I really enjoyed the mash. The whipped cream surprisingly didn\'t bother me very much at all. Definitely recommend this! \n
This place is definitely meant for sharing. We ordered the Honey Butter Chicken and the Nest Snow. \n<br />The honey butter chicken comes with fried tteokk, cranberries, almond slices, and potato wedges. It has a very unique flavor, the first few bites were very satisfying, but the richness kicks in and I couldn\'t get myself to reach for another piece.. If you\'ve had the caramel corn thing from Daiso, the dish tastes pretty much like that
cajun fried chicken with cream sauce, cheese &amp; whipped cream! juicy, tender &amp; crispy 😋
Creamy mac and cheese topped with shredded cheddar, lots of cheesy goodness. We thought that 1 portion will be sufficient along with their honey butter chicken (refer to previous post).
Was looking for a place for dinner on a Saturday night, realised most place were packed and we managed to get seats for 2 in less than 5 mins. Well known for their Korean fried chicken, we had their Honey Butter Chicken ($28.90). Perfect for 2 pax, it consist of crispy fried chicken, potato wedges and rice cakes with a honey butter sauce dip. Each piece of chicken were fried to perfection, every bite was a burst of sweetness. Love the chewiness of the Korean rice cake too, can\'t wait to try their other flavours. 😁👍🏻
Finally, i grabbed a chance to try their Honey Butter Chicken. It was tasty initially but somehow we felt that it was too greasy in the half way. Its portion was quite small with a high price. It would be better if you are in group of 4 as you can try their different kinds of fried chicken.
Everything was surprisingly light and not as greasy as it sounded.. feeling okay despite having mostly fried chicken for lunch. The batter doesn\'t leave a greasy film on your tongue, and the marinade/seasoning does well in delivering a multitude of sweet, savoury, tangy flavours. I liked the garlicky wings most. Also loved how chewy and glutinous the rice cakes were.
The taste was great! Real Kdrama Experience of Chicken n Beer! It may seems expensive, but it is just because of the big portion of it. It came with ddokboki that were also great! They have these innovative beers and cocktails that I will definitely try the next time I go there! 
Chir Chir’s new dishes this time is Honey Butter Chicken. Just for context, South Korea was swept by a craze for honey butter potato chips in 2014 and 2015. 
The new headline act - Honey Butter Chicken $28.90 is inspired by the popular honey butter potato chips that swept Korea. Chir Chir\'s take on this is glazes crispy battered chicken, potato wedges and pan-fried toppoki (rice cakes) in lashings of honey butter sauce. Such goodness.
It\'s so milky and creamy. Yums during the first few mouthful but I get tired of it quickly because of the thickness of the cheese. For the price, the portion is really small. \n<br />#chirchir #Burpple #Burpplesg #macandcheese #cheese
Spicy boneless chicken with Korean rice cake and sweet potato,it is just so nice! I choose the set that includes cheese macaroni and spicy tenders,it is more than enough for two person!
Nicely fried garlic flavored wings from Chir chir chicken. It\'s one of the best Korean fried chicken I\'ve tasted so far, really finger lickin gd! I used to patronize Chicken Up for their wings but I think I\'ve found my new love lol. But honestly, 30 bucks for 7 pcs of wings is really godamn pricey. Other than the pricing, everything else is a bliss!                       香蒜醬口味的韓式炸雞翅！蒜的味道不會太重，外皮又香脆可口。只是價錢有點貴，不然一定會大受歡迎！整體來說還是讚啦👍🏼
Even though this Mac and cheese was a little more watery than I expected, it was not too bad to satisfy any cravings I had!
Saw this drink on most of the tables and decided to give it a try. At first I thought this was going to taste like normal beer but this turned out to be a refreshing drink. It has some hints of lemon in it and it tasted like jolly shandy but nicer and with higher alcohol content 》$16.90
Boneless chicken tenders fried in Chir Chir\'s special batter 》$24.90
Filled with sweet and juicy mangoes! Fresh salad topped with yogurt dressing and blueberries 》$11.90
Macaroni covered with soft cream sauce and cheddar cheese 》$9.90
One of the best Korean fried chicken. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Definitely worth the wait. The drinks are slightly over priced tho. 
Everytime I\'m here, I must order this!! The creamy cheesy taste is just so unforgettable!! 😄😋
Gotta say, after eating some of the best Korean fried chicken in Korea itself, Chir Chir wasn\'t too bad. The Nest Snow was definitely something different from the regular 양념 (spicy) chicken I\'m used to having; fried chicken bathed in a cheesy cream sauce and topped with whipped cream. Unique and tasty!
The Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is still one of the best in town, although this time, somehow wasn\'t mind-blowing as our first visit few months back. Thanks to a #Groupon promo, we had so much to fill out stomachs, and still enough for takeaway 😋 The lady boss/manager was friendly as before.
Love this!!! Cost: $28.90. The serving was HUGE and I mean really HUGE. Enough for 3-4 pax! Super super tasty and crunchy. There is rice cake and sweet potato as well! Rice cake was fried and covered with the special sauce 😘 
Love it! Especially when I ate with an empty stomach 😂 well fried and definitely appeals to fries lover 
What\'s one of the biggest fear while indulging on good food? Sinful delights as it is. Be ready to gain a few kilos after dining @ Chir Chir. I kid.
Their garlicky chicken was highly recommended by both of my friends and colleagues. So i got to try it!! I love Chir Chir for its variety. No matter what you like, fried, sauced, creamy or baked, you have plenty of choices here! Beside chicken dishes, menu also includes salads, cheese fries, soup and drinks! The price is very reasonable, with chicken dishes priced around $30, which are good for two. 
Garlicky fried chicken. Tasty, garlic taste was mild, piping hot chicken cooked just right! Worth the eat especially with my groupon deal ;)
Sprinkled with almonds and bits of garlic, the well-marinated chicken tenders will leave you wanting more! The roasted sweet potatoes and chewy fried tteokbokki concealed beneath the succulent boneless chicken pieces also adds different textures to the dish. A good combination of savoury and sweet, the crispy exterior coated with the garlicky sauce gave the familiar soy Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) flavour yet a little different and with a distinct aroma. One of the better KFC I have tried~
Crispy. Savoury. Tender. Juicy. Fresh. One of the best KFC in town! (Yes, just the town area only.)
Chicken tenders sitting atop mash potato in a large pool of béchamel sauce and cheese. Don\'t really get the whip cream. The broccoli and olives helps with the heaviness. Chicken tenders were chunky but not exceptional. I think it\'s way overpriced at $32.90.
Not as cheesy as it looks. But I guess you won\'t get so jelat eating it. The accompanying tangy sour cream like sauce also helps to cleanse the palate. Don\'t really recommend this though. 
Came piping hot! Was really impressed with the wonderful crisp and fresh chicken meat. Even the breast meat was tender and succulent. Flavour wise, garlic taste was quite mild to me, and the umami soy sauce helps to whet up the appetite. Very satisfying but pretty pricey for $28.90 for one whole chicken. 
Price: $32.90. Verdict: On the fence. The name \'Nest Snow\' attempts to capture a complex and schizophrenic dish that is really neither here nor there. What it essentially is is a plate of chicken tender lying atop a cheese-milk concoction sauce with whipped cream resting awkwardly atop the chicken tender. There are 2 main problems with this dish. First, there are too many things going on at the same time thereby making it difficult for one to focus on the goodness of the individual component. Secondly, the mix of semi-viscous sauce with crispy tender while not unheard of is often a recipe for unsatisfying mediocrity. This dish fails to overcome its fate of unsatisfying mediocrity. And yet, not all is lost in this dish because the milk-cheese sauce is in all honesty quite tasty and lovely. While the crispness of the chicken tender has eluded us due to the copious amount of milk-cheese sauce, the original tastiness of the chicken tender remains strong and continues to carry its own weight amidst this dish of confusion and schizophrenia. This dish is not recommended if you were to only get a single item from the menu. But if you have already gotten the much tastier garlicky chicken, and wish for some novelty, go ahead and order this. 
Essentially fried chicken tenders sitting atop a white cheese sauce, topped with whipped cream. It tastes exactly like how you would imagine it to be. The chicken itself wasn\'t particularly spectacular; in fact, it was rather disappointing in comparison to the garlicky fried chicken we had as I thought this was a little dryer and not that juicy. I couldn\'t understand this particular combination as the sauce and cream didn\'t really do anything to compliment the chicken. Think of the sauce as a richer and creamier version of carbonara pasta sauce. While it was not bad per se, nothing really justified the higher price tag of this as compared to its traditional fried chicken counterparts. I guess you\'re paying for novelty if you get this dish. You\'re better off ordering two plates of their fried chicken in different flavours. Priced at $32.60
Price:$9.90. Verdict: not recommended. Cheese fries has become commonplace pseudo-western dish that one can find from KFC, to hawker centers, to the more atas bars around. And yet not all cheese fries taste good and this particular cheezy fries from Chir chir falls prey to this category. Chir chir is a relatively new Korean fried chicken outlet and it specializes in fried chicken in different sauce. And let\'s just say cheese fries is not its speciality. The cheese is bland, unflavourful and stingily inadequate in quantity. The only saving grace is perhaps the small cup of yogurt-like sauce. And also, the world is full of relatives and the only comparable dish (ie in the carbo category) that this has is the dish of Mac and cheese that is pathetically small and not value for money. So perhaps, on that note, if one were to crave for some carbo amidst the chicken-overload, this particular cheezy fries can perhaps fulfill that craving in spite of all its shortcoming. 
For a restaurant that specialises in fried chicken, I wasn\'t expecting much from the cheese fries, and I was right in lowering my expectations. Really nondescript, and nothing spectacular to rave about. While the addition of cubed capsicum amongst other veggies coupled with their yoghurt like sauce did help to make things less heavy, it wasn\'t great either. The cheese was essentially non-existent, and tbh KFC\'s cheese fries are a better bang for your buck. Priced at $9.90
Price: $28.90. Verdict: recommended. Fried chicken with garlic soy sauce sounds boring and a typical but it has exceeded all usual expectation. The meat was tender and juicy and the highly appetizing garlic soy sauce makes it nigh-impossible to stop one from grabbing yet another piece. The win-it factor for this chicken is however not the meat. It was the skin. The skin was crispy and yet not excessively oily. It was well flavored with the appetizing garlic soy sauce and yet it does not overpower the inherent X-factor of the chicken meat. A must try for every patron to chir chir
Finally got round to trying the legendary and much heralded.m Chir Chir. While the waiting time in the queue was pretty obnoxious, this plate of fried garlic chicken pieces was more than enough to make up for the time spent queuing. The chicken pieces were freshly fried to perfection, leading to each piece being incredibly juicy. The chicken was soft and succulent, and the meat really came easily off the bone. Even the breast meat was rather juicy and tender. The crispy exterior coated with a sweet, savoury, garlicky sauce gave the dish it\'s familiar and iconic Korean fried chicken flavour. Sprinkled with almonds and tiny garlic bits, this will leave you wanting more. Really recommend to get this if you want something that\'s distinctly Korean, but not too spicy. Priced at $28.60. 
My 4th time to Chir Chir.. Still as yummy, quality is not compromise! Nice!
Spicy tenders not meant for the faint hearted. It\'s the kind of spicy that comes to you at the end. My friends found it too spicy but I find the spice and sweetness quite good.
With a lot of cheese sauce and some mozzarella flakes. They added olives and capsicum which gives a nice refreshing taste when you bite into it!
🐔❄️ So popular among kids and adults, with little cheesy trees of broccoli you wouldn\'t even mind eating (if you hate broccoli)。#chirchirsg
Happy Fry-day guys!! Finally treated myself to something (unhealthy) after a long week. Love their batter! Garlic, herbs and a little chilli. The exterior is tasty and crispy while the interior is tender and juicy! However the crispiness doesn\'t stay so you got to eat it fast! 
How come my mug doesn\'t have the chir chir logo like other people?! 😠 This just looks cute that\'s all. The whipped cream is fresh and well whipped, but the beer is on the bitter side and not crisp enough. I will pass this for my Cass anytime. 
Nest snow chicken as their signature is the best. And the spicy chicken is not spicy at all
Because one serving of Fried Garlicky Wings doesn\'t quite #fatdieus, we had to order Chir Chir\'s signature Snow Nest too! What a spectacular sight, a show-stopper - just look at all that creamy, cheesy... snowy, creaminess! (Lol.. for the lack better description) Worth ordering for the wow-factor, and the lovely idea of mashed sweet potatoes hidden under the chicken, although the fried chicken chunks were somewhat dryer, and flavours pale in comparison to the Garlicky Wings.
Celebrated a friend\'s birthday with the cosy gang over a sinful #fatdieus meal. First visit to Chir Chir for all of us, and now we know why this place is constantly packed. Some of the BEST Fried Garlicky Wings ever! Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and coated with bursts of garlicky goodness in every single bite. A must-order. Friends who eat fried chicken together, stay together! Lol! 😁
Love how it\'s always freshly deep fried! My favourite has got to be the garlicky tenders with yummy tteokbokki &amp; sweet potato pieces!
I\'m never going back to KFC after the invasion of Korean Fried Chicken. This ultimate \"Nest Snow\" from Chir Chir has definitely raised the bar for Fried Chicken. 
😏😏😏 All thanks to the Tring 313 mobile app, we managed to secure this meal at a super good deal at 40% off! Download yours now! #313foodie
The chicken here is still as good as I remembered! Service is extremely prompt even when the restaurant is so full. Happy 😄 Anyway super glad that the weekend is here and I get a break from work.
Some spicy chicken tenders, topped with rich cream sauce will make my day! But do note the portion is quite big so bring down 2-3 friend with you to share.
Draught beer with topped of fresh cream , $13.90 (350ml), the beer is not cold enough for me, should try others beverage 
The most popular dish, every table have this dish, abit overprice, just nice for two person, will try another dish besides this 
Crispy whole Chicken Tenders perched on top of a bed of sweet potatoes puree &amp; complemented with a sea of white cream sauce at the based served with vegetable. I adored that the Nest Snow topped wth Whipped Cream &amp; Grated Parmesan Cheese. Cost u $32.90 Good for sharing in grp. i guess 1 or 2 ppl can\"t finsh it. Recommended to order this when u come in grp.\n<br />Address see my previous post
I also read the review of @danielfooddiary. At this Korean Chicken Restaurant There are many Type of chicken served.  Best to come in group to share. kinda shock the price is expensive. We order is Crispy fried chicken &amp; spicy fried chicken. No need fly to korea u can try it here\n<br />Name:Chir Chir\n<br />Address: 313 Somerset #B3-04/05/06\n<br />Singapore 238895\n<br />Operating Hours 1000-2300hrs Daily
Still went ahead to order &amp; boy, so glad I did!
Oh this will be our monthly must visit eating place! Lol!! Hubby and I decided to visit it once a month trying out different chicken dishes. Today\'s his first time here and he loves the chicken tenders. 👍🏼 
Brought my hubby here to try the fried chicken wings. We first had it in Korea and it was really yummy! This is my 3rd visit and the chicken wings today didn\'t taste as good as the previous 2 visits. The chicken wings had a \"chicken\" smell if you know what I meant. Don\'t know if the marination wasn\'t done well or the chicken wings ain\'t fresh. Luckily, the chicken tenders we ordered were good! Phew! We will still be back to try the other chicken dishes! 
Extremely fragrant and mouth watering aroma, the bone-in pieces of chicken are tender and moist.
Our second time at Chir Chir and well,  same results! Wings were too oily and you get sian after a while. Made me run for the toilet a couple of times too 😂
The aroma from the garlic infused into the tender juicy chicken is simply amazing. You can eat it on its own, but if you have any balance, you can always stuff it into your sandwich for breakfast the next day. Yummy yummy
Back to Chir Chir for the second time and this time we decided to try their  a la carte fried chicken. We settled for the garlicky fried chicken - love the crispy on the outside but tender on the inside chicken. The fried garlic, chili and sliced almonds gave additional kick to it. Portion is good for 3 - 4 persons.
Fragrant, non greasy chicken chunks with crisp skin, but it\'s also rather dry and firm in texture. Not that great.
😍😍😍 insert more crazy eyes for this cos I looovvvvveee it!!! you can never go wrong when you see garlic and soy sauce for all korean fried chicken! yumsss 😋 #burpple
😘 if there\'s a ridiculously photogenic guy, then this must be the ridiculously photogenic food! 😂 and I just got to know that that mountain is actually cheese shavings w WHIPPED CREAM omg whipped cream is crazy sinful!!! 😑😑😑 fyi @mellygeehs lolol #burpple
Fabulous Macaroni and Cheese ($9.90) with rich flavour and ooey-gooey texture. I certainly didn\'t expect such a comforting dish coming from this side of the equator - at a Korean fried chicken restaurant.
Fun fact about CHIR CHIR: OCD simply mean Obsessive Chicken Disorder. Once you tried the hen here, you might not fall in love with another elsewhere.
this is POWERFULLL!! Can\'t get enough of the cheeseeeee OMGG
Back here for the second time with another group of friends. Ordered these fried chicken tenders in original that come with dips. The chicken tenders are really very tender! Yummy!! 
Not that spicy as mentioned by some reviews. The balance between sweetness and spiciness is nicely done! Yummy! 
Tried Chir Chir sweet and spicy fried chicken in Seoul and can\'t forget it. It was super yummy! Singapore outlet not bad too! The snow nest of fried chicken tenders in cream sauce is delicious! Tender chicken meat with whipped cream in cream sauce... This combi may sounds weird but it tastes so good! I\'m craving for more! 
Strangely, I feel fatter now than when I was eating fried chicken three times a week for two months. Gawd, I miss those days.
Korean chickens! Had really nice cheese fries (abt 9.90), rosemary chickens (alotttt, 2-3 persons then can eat finish) which comes with an potato, egg &amp; small bowl of bell papers, and had coconut milktail(abit too sweet for me). The cheese fries was unique as it comes with flakes of cheese and bell peppers and olives, taste really yummy. The chickens are really good and tenders, just that I kept using the metal thing to get the chicken until my fingers were sore hahaha! But overall it was good. Service is fast and the queue is worth it! (20-30min). Suggestion go with a group of friends so as to finish haha, its really big portion ^^
4 munchies: Crispy, juicy and well-marinated wings with sweet &amp; spicy sauce and almond flakes. I also loved the crispiness of the roasted sweet potato from the skin that was left on, and that it was moist and soft on the inside. However, the dish could make do without the fried topokki that was hard and not chewy at all.
Serves really crispy and tender juicy fried chicken! 👍 👑Nest Snow👑 The tender crispy chicken tenders were not only large in size but went well with the creamy based sauce. Kinda tasted like a awesome version of mushroom soup.  Would eat it again if i have the groupon discount to subsidise against the original cost of $32 tho. 😉
Best combo! Korean fried chicken and beer woohoo 🍗🍗🍗🍻 With @alan_loke and @foldedmemos also hehe.
🍺🍺🍺 We were all momentarily stunned when we realized we didn\'t know how to start drinking hahahahah #foammustache 👨🏻🍻
3 munchies: Imagine strips of spicy fried chicken breast sandwiched in whipped cream, cheese and sweet potato mash – all of these partially submerged in a pool of cream sauce. Sounds jelat much? Yup. I also wished there was a justification made on why this dish is priced at $32.90, albeit the fried chicken did do the dish some justice for its Cajun marinade and tenderness.
4.5 munchies: Who\'d have thought that a seafood dish would stand out at a Korean fried chicken place? The flavourful, garlicky broth with a hint of spiciness was packed with all the seafood sweetness from the fresh mussels, crayfish, prawns and abundance of clams. Great for sharing for up to 4 people, this consommé complements all the fried and savoury dishes perfectly.
This dish is seemingly sinful because it is simply a dish that compiles everything that people generally love eating all in one pan. Fried Chicken that sits atop cream sauce and cheese with broccoli and a pumpkin mash, with whipped cream over the top. Admittedly the whipped cream did nothing much to the chicken, but we loved how the shaved cheese atop gave a different dimension of savoury flavours to the juicy fried chicken that stayed surprisingly crisp despite sitting atop the sauce. The cream sauce is pretty much like cream-based pasta sauce, which no doubt goes well with the broccoli but also good with the earthiness of the mash. And who would not love melted cheese that is stringy to pull anyway? Enjoyed it immensely, though I have a hunch that it seems to appeal generally to those who love heavier flavours, while people whom have lighter tastebuds would find this pretty much an overkill.
Lady Killer ($16.90) - A mojito slushie that comes with a down turned bottle of Cass beer. Perfect for sharing, but it\'s possible to finish it on you own as well. Goes great with the fried chicken as it\'s refreshing. 
I am a sucker for cheese. \n<br />It was so good! \n<br />And the fries were drenched in cheese I loved it like There\'s no tomorrow. \n<br />10/10
Korean fried chicken shops are the new upcoming trends in Singapore. Today my partner and I decided to try out Chir Chir chicken factory since there wasn\'t a queue unlike the weekends. Nest snow chicken are chicken strips marinated in Cajun spices, hidden mash sweet potato jem! creamy cheesy sauce base top with creammmmm. So special! 😱 Tender chicken strips are rather spicy, hot and crispy. I really enjoyed the creamy cheesy sauce. Finishing with mash sweet potato to balance the saltiness. Overall 8/10👍🏼
The batter is crisp and doesn\'t taste dry like flour. I just find it a bit pointless cause the chicken isn\'t seasoned at all. Chir chir is still better than chicken up though. #marshmunch #burpple
We tried the Garlicky Chicken ($28.90) which has crispy tender fried chicken with Chir Chir special soy sauce and garlic flakes. It also goes well with the refreshing Blue Marine Tok Tok ($14.90 non alcoholic). Happy food to end the week!
Was around Somerset area at 10pm and most restaurants were closed. Lucky enough, Chir Chir opens till 11pm! Just when you thought that feasting on korean fried chicken for supper is sinful enough, wait till you try Nest Up! A nest of Cajun spiced chicken tenders on a bed of mashed sweet potato and creamy cheesy sauce, topped with whipped cream, we were sold! I\'m not a fan of whipped cream, but I must say, it adds up flavor and texture to the sauce. Definitely a great way to start off Labour Day weekend! 😄
Nest Snow ($32.90) - You get juicy chicken tenders with cajun seasoning in a pool of rich cream sauce, a scoop of sweet potato mash hidden underneath &amp; a swirl of whipped cream on top. Mix it all up before eating. This brings fried chicken to a whole new and guiltier level! But will get very tired of the taste after two pieces
Garlicky Chicken Tenders ($26.90) - One of my favorite dish from the menu. Boneless chicken tenders in special soy sauce topped with crunchy garlic flakes, chunks of roasted sweet potatoes and fried Korean rice cakes. Love the fragrant and the subtle hint of spiciness of it!
Just one more day to the long weekends, hang in there! Even Danbo is eyeing at the Chir Cream Beer ($13.90 for 350ml) but I guess he\'s too young to drink. A different kind of experience by serving draught Carlsberg with freshly whipped cream to go with Korean Fried Chicken.
My favourite from Chir Chir has got to be the Garlicky Chicken Tenders ($26.90). The sauce coating, minced garlic and fried garlic goes so well with the proteins. Hidden beneath the heap, you can also find sweet potatoes and Korean rice cake that is mixed together with the chicken. For sure, this dish will scare the daylights out of any vampires.
The Korean Fried Chicken craze has not slowed down a bit and Chir Chir Fusion Chicken Factory has finally hit our shores. It has 2 outlets currently at 313 Somerset and Bedok Point, with the former having a longer queuing time of at least an hour, especially during the weekends. One of the popular and photogenic dishes has got to be the Nest Snow ($32.90) that has spicy Cajun chicken tenders, on top of a rich cream sauce and sweet potato purée. To top it all off (literally), they added a ball of whipped cream and sprinkled cheese shavings. I had to scrap aside the whipped cream (not really a fan) and stop at 2 pieces as the cream sauce gets too heavy after a while. Also, making a special guest appearance, can you spot Danbo peeking hungrily at the Nest Snow?
7 drumlets and 7 wings in each basket. Considering each bird has 2 pairs of wings - [2(7 + 7)]/4 = 7 sacrificed. We killed an entire coop of chickens! No wonder the bird is angry. #angrybird #chirchirsg #instafood #foodstagram #burpple #eatousg #koreanfriedchicken
Thankfully, I ran 9 km just before dinner.
Spicy wings ($28.90) r really very spicy! Hiam to till very shiok! Huge portion that is good for sharing. Love the soft and delicious sweet potato too! 😍😍😍😍😍
Interesting drinks - frozen mocktails with beer flow out as you drink
Cajun chicken tenders are served on a sweet potato puree in a pool of cream sauce with broccoli, peppers and olives, and topped with whipped cream and cheese - This got to be eaten while it is serve hot..aftertt you wouldn\'t want to touch it
Finally trying this out! Chicken, cheese and whipped cream! Really quirky fusion KFC (Korean Fried Chicken)
What\'s for lunch? Hope it was a hotplate of comforting Mac &amp; Cheese 😋
Fried chicken with my yoga homies post-8am-ashtanga class. Well at least we worked out for this! I think the garlic chicken is still the best though.
😉 Normal &amp; spicy fried chicken mix, would be great if the spicy sauce was more evenly \"painted\" over those crispy glorious pieces of chicken 😂 #chirchirsg
you can find it hidden in some of the dishes at chir chir. so rare to find good tasting topokki in singapore, this I one of the rare few good ones
Garlicky Tenders ($26.90) since we were too lazy to eat those with bones, but those who like have no fear, they have \'kiaps\' to eat without having to dirty your fingers. The tenders are crispy and moist with makes it delicious. Do come earlier to avoid the long queue, especially since Groupon has it again (even I gotten 2 vouchers for this dining 😉)
I loved this dish, cajun fried chicken tenders on sweet potato purée and cream sauce topped with whipped cream and cheese shavings. Something unique and different, the chicken was very tender with crispy exterior and the creaminess of the sauce was just right.
After selling out their Groupon vouchers in less than a week, I was determined to visit the new KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) restaurant that everybody\'s been talking about - Chir Chir Fusion Chicken Factory. Opened by 5 friends, the new joint located at the opposite side of the basement from Llao Llao was absolutely packed even when I went over at around 8pm on Good Friday with a queue that stretches for about half an hour. And ppl were still joining the queue!
Chir Chir\'s signature juicy chicken tenders with Cajun seasoning, topped with rich cream sauce and sweet potato salad. I never knew chicken can be cooked this way. Swirled with fresh whipped cream. Da bomb!
😋 So creamy and milky, with the coconut and sweet strawberry flavour. Yums!
Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside! Chir chir serves up piping hot fried chicken and real cheesy mac &amp; cheese~
I just had KFC... Kentucky Fried Chicken. Not the same but I guess No 🐟,🍤 also good. 😔
If you haven\'t managed to try this fabulous Korean Fried Chicken 🍗 chain, this is your chance! If you already have, need I say more?
The Spicy BBQ version undergoes an additional step of pan-frying so that the chicken is evenly coated in sauce. The dish is accompanied with salsa, a whole salt-baked egg and a fluffy baked potato with sour cream. 
Chicken is jinjja daebak!! Feels as though I\'m back in Korea. 😭 Quite a big portion for 2 pax, best to go in groups of 4-5! 
The restaurant is finally here in SG! didn\'t had a chance to try the fries when I was in Korea, but I got to say it is good and big portion too! 😅
Did not go for the Snow Nest everyone was raving about. It\'s really a test to see how they fare for the normal stuff, without the pomps and fluffs. And that garlic fried chicken wings were just so darn amazing! 2nd last decadent meal before my 3d juice cleanse starting on wed.
We ordered a whole lot of food and drinks: Chir Cheese Fries ($9.90), Garlicky Tenders ($26.90), the famous Nest Snow ($32.90), Kooksoondang Makgeolli ($24.00), Chir Cream Beer (350ml $13.90) and Lady Killer! ($16.90). Love the taste of the chicken especially the tenders, will feature them in another post soon! \n<br />The food portion was generous and even though food was awesome, we can\'t finish it. Guess we will need to bring another along next time round. \n<br />On a side note, they are having Groupon vouchers at the moment, do check it out!!
Have you tried Chir Chir the popular Korean fusion chicken at 313 Somerset? They just opened a second outlet at Bedok Point today, and I bought a $100 cash voucher from Groupon with 45% savings. \n<br />Spotted over 641 bought online, this is such an incredible deal. Selling fast for a limited time only (27 March). Faster go buy now and don\'t say I never say. 
A dish of cajun chicken tenders, sweet potato purée (yum yum!😋) all siting on a bed of parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar cheeses! As if this is not good enough, you topped it with a generous swirl of whipped cream. 😌 Definitely a must-order when you\'re here! Ps: becareful not to burn your tongue when you try the lick the delicious cheesy cream sauce off the hotplate. 😏😋👍
😜 Cajun Chicken Tenders on a hot plate of Parmesan, Mozzarella and Cheddar....SO Yummy that I licked the plate clean 😋 a heaven for cheese and fried chicken lovers
Yay finally tried the garlicky wings and it tastes supremely awesome! I kinda like it a lot though! My personal favourite! \n<br />Thanks @rachelxie &amp; @chirchirsg for this media invite!!! 😉 #chirchirsg
Still not the kind of snow I want. Where are you, Jon Snow? 😭 #GameOfThrones
Cream beer check. Time to pry my eyes away from all the sad news and indulge.
If you fancy juicy korean fried chicken and pairing them w beers, this is for you. A second outlet is slated to open at bedok point in March, good for you easties. More details on jacqsowhat.com (link in bio as usual) 🍗🍖🍺 #chirchirsg
Waking up craving for lots of food! • [CRISPY FRIED CHICKEN S$26.90] - Marinated for 6 hours in Chir Chir\'s house seasoning before being battered and deep-fried. Its succulent flesh is tasty from skin to bone! One of the better fried chicken in town! Crispy Fried Tenders S$24.90 and Crispy Fried Wings S$26.90 (7 pieces) are also available.
Possibly the best korean fried chicken I had so far!! 🍗 topped with garlic flakes, it was crispy on the outside, marinated with fragrant soy garlic sauce, juicy and tender inside.
I am damn hungry omg. Hope I can stop myself from overeating (again) tonight.
Hell yeah ! Give me some crispy fried chix anyday! Fresh, hot, mildly spicy... Who\'s KFC again? 
 Whole chicken marinated for 12 hours, oven-roasted and then pan-fried with Korean rice cakes. Each succulent piece of chicken is evenly coated in spicy BBQ sauce. The roasted chicken is served with salsa, salt-baked egg &amp; baked potato with sour cream. One of my favorite @chirchirsg.
Chir Chir is one of the best Korean fried chicken I had to date. Featuring three of the signature chicken centric dishes Crispy, Garlicky and Spicy chicken. My vote goes to the garlicky chicken if you love lip smacking soy and garlic.
$12.90. The cup is almost the size of my face (and I do not have a small face). Coconut milk with strawberry. Never thought they\'d go so well together!
$32.90 good for 2! the portion is a little too much for us (ok we are small eaters I guess) but we managed. Been seeing so much of this on Burpple, I had to try!! Whipped cream with cheese for extra sinfulness; on these Cajun chicken tenders atop mashed sweet potato swimming in a hot plate of delish cream sauce!
This creamy ice blended coconut milk drink with sweet strawberry puree is too good to share. Yes both straws are mine… ALL mine!
No worries. @chirchirsg offers alternatives such as this SPICY ROASTED CHICKEN! But careful, it burns! 🔥👍 Otherwise, you can always go for the garlicky flavour!😉 read my full review on dayre!😊
If you think that Chir Chir is just another KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), think again because you are wrong. Chir Chir Fusion Chicken Factory brings freshly cooked chicken dishes to a whole new level. The dishes such as the Nest Snow you see above is not only photo worthy, it tasted unexpectedly good too.
All i want is this nest snow consisting of cajun fried chicken with cream sauce, some vegetables and cheese shavings(i could have done without the whipped cream though) 😍😌😋🐓 #nofilter #shootkahliao
Went back to #ChirChirSG last night for dinner—the queue is quite insane. This Mac &amp; Cheese didn\'t really leave me craving for more unfortunately. Gooey, creamy, cheesy, but a little bland overall. I think it was missing a little meat substance… like maybe bacon for flavouring. 😁
Dreaming of Korean Fried Chicken right now and these crispy Cajun chicken tenders come to mind. Hidden under the chicken tenders is a bed of tasty sweet potato purée that I would lick off the plate if I could.
😋 but there were fair amount of likings for the rest as well! You really have to try them all to decide for yourself!😁 So I suggest you to come down with a group of friends to @chirchirsg!😉 They are one of the largest fried chicken franchises in Korea with over 100 outlet across the country!👍
Garlicky Wings - Chicken wings marinated in house-made soy sauce, topped with minced garlic &amp; fried garlic cloves. Comes with roasted sweet potato chunks &amp; fried Korean rice cakes
I think this is a bit too much for 2 to share though, it gets sickening after a while but the first couple of chicks were awesome though. \n<br />On a sidenote, I\'m terribly thankful that I\'ve a girlfriend who is willing to feast with me and not someone who insists on rabbit food every meal 😁
So I finally made it back to the gym tonight and there I was, perspiring my guts out, my skin all beaded and dripping and wet, my clothes soaked from undies out... And all I could think of was... FRIED CHICKEN.
It\'s fried chicken heaven there! Check it out if you haven\'t. Full review on my blog: qiuuing.wordpress.com.
😍 Tender, boneless Cajun chicken chunks served over goguma (honeyed Korean sweet potato) purée, worshipped in a pool of gooey Parmesan-mozzarella-cheddar mix cream sauce. 😘 Then topped off with a dollop of their freshly, in-house whipped cream. #313Somerset
Basically, it\'s draught beer topped with a swirl of freshly whipped cream.
Not a fan of fried chicken, fret not! Not 100% are fried chicken here. [KKANPUNG KING S$28.90] is a combination of spicy and sweet sauce with dipping cream, tasting very much like gong bao chicken. I would still say I prefer garlic chicken the most 😋😋 oh and it also comes with roasted sweet potatoes and fried toppoki (Korean rice cakes)! 
It\'s been such a busy day today! 😩 Thank god it\'s Friday! \n<br />【 MAC &amp; CHEESE S$9.90 】- macaroni covered with soft cream sauce and cheddar cheese, perfect for cheese lovers. As for us, just nice for 2! 
Gonna be my fourth time here this week, but I\'m still looking forward to stuffing my face with more of my favourite fried chicken. And I know somebody (cough @weeteck cough) who\'s probably highly anticipating his TGIF dinner tonight, too!
Choose your team—do you prefer your chicken wings deep-fried with soy sauce and minced garlic? Or do you prefer them deep-fried with a spicy chilli sauce?
Boneless spicy Cajun chicken tenders rested on a huge scoop of honey sweet potato purée, swimming in a pool of cream sauce, topped with freshly whipped cream and sprinkled with parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar. Can you smell it already? 😋😍 #ChirChirSG #EileenFoodTasting #OngsLaiJiak #KoreanFriedChicken #Korean
Tok! at #ChirChirSG. One of the fizzy thirst quenchers to have with your Korean Fried Chicken. 🍹
At Chir Chir they only use fresh chicken (not frozen) that\'s marinated for 6 hours in Chir Chir’s house seasoning, deep-fried and served with salsa and honey mustard.
Chir me up with spicy bbq roasted chicken, please?
Sometimes, shit happens and annoys the hell out of me. But then, I count my blessings and think of the awesome clients that I am blessed to be working with and for.
The Crispy Fried Chicken($26.90 for the whole bird) is marinated for six hours and lightly-battered before deep-frying. Most importantly, only fresh chicken is used. It is so well cooked that even the chicken breast meat is moist and tender. 😍😘 There was no trace of uncooked, sticky and soggy flour batter(YAY!) either. Definitely my favourite dish for the night!Who needs KFC when we can have Chir Chir? 😋 Thank you @rachelxie for the invite and @chirchirsg for hosting us! 😊😊\n<br />.\n<br />||\n<br />Choice of -\n<br />- Crispy Fried Chicken($26.90 for the whole bird)\n<br />- Crispy Fried Wings($26.90 for 7 wings and 7 drumlets)\n<br />- Crispy Fried Tenders($24.90)\n<br />#OngsLaiJiak #ChirChirSG
Honey Grape Salad at #ChirChirSG with Green grapes, walnuts, almonds and raisins dressed with ricotta and whipped cream. Mix it all up to tingle your tastebuds ready for the delicious Korean fried chicken served at Chir Chir. I liked the light, crisp honey-and-garlic tortillas served with the salad… great for snacking on! ***Food styling for photo purposes only. Actual salad comes with 2pcs of tortillas*** 😄✌️
😋 #ChirChirSG #RAGEeats
Just had a carb-heavy media tasting at lunchtime, but my mouth is already itching for dinner time, when I can sink my chompers into this succulent chook smothered in a fiery BBQ sauce.
Whole chicken marinated for 12 hours!!! – then oven-roasted and pan-fried with a fiery BBQ sauce. [$32.90]
Tok! at #ChirChirSG
Setting up shop in Orchard 313@Somerset, Chir Chir (pronounced Chi-Re Chi-Re) is a restaurant chain from Korea that specialises in deep fried Korean-style chicken and -- to the joy of many -- pairs it with beer. The chicken servings here are portioned for large groups, what a great excuse to bring friends! Definitely order the Nest Snow, essentially Cajun chicken tenders in rich cream sauce topped with whipped cream, and pair it with the Ladykiller, a mojito drink served with an upside-down bottle of beer that replenishes the drink as you sip it. 
Fresh chicken marinated for 6 hours in their special house dressing, deep fried and served with salsa and honey mustard. And you don\'t have to worry about getting your hands dirty here because they have mini tongs!
The grape salad comes with this awesome honey and garlic tortillas! The ricotta and whipped cream are both made in house.
Thought I should share some of the more under-the-radar dishes at @chirchirsg, because while their signatures are deep-fried chook, there\'s so much more the menu has to offer.
🍻🔫 applaud whoever invent this. Taste like bintang radler btw with a cooler stylish presentation 👏👏
Another place to satisfy your Korean chicken cravings! We ordered the garlic flavour as recommended by their staff there. Mac and cheese was really cheesy but good.
Still not fully recovered, but longing to dive into this pile of crispy, golden chicken parts. Using only fresh, not frozen, meat, this dish has the poultry marinated for 6 hours in a proprietary seasoning before being battered and deep-fried. You\'ll find the meat is immensely tasty from skin to bone – great on its own or complemented with the accompanying salsa and honey mustard sauce. Also available as wings or boneless tenders.
Tok! I order this becos of the color. And it taste good too!
Which part of the chicken do you like best? I love to eat chicken breast!! 😋😋
Lots of green in this salad, even though it all comes from just one ingredient – seedless grapes! I can\'t describe how much I love grapes (possibly my favourite fruit after strawberries), so you can just imagine how much of this I gobbled up at the internal tasting.
Ever tried chicken with whipped cream? No? I thought so.
So here\'s the story behind this beer and whipped cream combi: it was first created by some youths in Hongdae (a district in Seoul that is popular among teenagers and young adults). Its popularity caught on when a Korean drama featured it in an episode, in which the lead actress took a sip – or maybe it was a gulp, because there\'s no way to reach the beer under all that sweet stuff otherwise, leaving a \"moustache\" across her upper lip which the lead actor found so alluring that he promptly plonked a wet one on her smackers 💋. Kiss, anyone? Lol.
Feel like you need to drown your sorrows? Get happy with this thoughtful combination – the beer provides the alcohol, the whipped cream provides the sugar.
Go Chimaek 치맥!
A generous portion, party of chewy jjolmyeon (Korean wheat noodles), topokki (Korean rice cakes) and beansprouts are simmered in a sweet and savoury gravy with chunks of chicken pieces which are fried in a thin crispy batter prior.  Spicy food lovers may opt for the spicy version where added sliced red chillies and capsaicin sauce provide a good spicy kick!\n<br />-\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Chir Chir\n<br />▫️313@Somerset #B3-04/05/06\n<br />▫️Bedok Point #02-05/06\n<br />▫️Bugis Junction #02-50\n<br />▫️Chinatown Point #01-43\n<br />▫️JEM #04-13/14\n<br />==========\n<br />Thank you @chirchirsg for hosting and @justinfoodprints for the invite. #chirchirsg\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#korea #koreanfood #whati8today #foodsg #sgfood #instasg  #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #cafehoppingsg #yoursingapore #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats
.\n<br />Mildly-spiced, these chunks of chicken are coated with their signature batter and generously sprinkled with curry powder, giving a crunchy and satisfying bite.  What’s really impressive is the meat remains tender and juicy!

The former has a succulent bite, very appetizing with the meat glazed and roasted with bbq and soy sauce. You may opt for the spicy option (spiked with gochujang sauce) if you love spicy food. Recommend to stir both the meat and rice together as the fragrance from the Korean rice (mixed with seaweed flakes, flying fish roe and sesame oil) adds more flavour to the dish.\n<br />-\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Chir Chir\n<br />▫️313@Somerset #B3-04/05/06\n<br />▫️Bedok Point #02-05/06\n<br />▫️Bugis Junction #02-50\n<br />▫️Chinatown Point #01-43\n<br />▫️JEM #04-13/14\n<br />==========\n<br />Thank you @chirchirsg for hosting and @justinfoodprints for the invite. #chirchirsg\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#korea #koreanfood #whati8today #foodsg #sgfood #instasg  #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #cafehoppingsg #yoursingapore #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats
.\n<br />Tender and juicy chicken thigh meat, together with topokko (Korean rice cake), are tossed in a party of bbq sauce and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste). End result is a plate of flavourful and spicy goodness (you’ve been warned; pair this with one of their delightful drinks!) For the less-spicy eaters, coat the meat with the gooey melted mozzarella cheese - it’ll help balancing the spiciness.\n<br />.\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Chir Chir\n<br />▫️313@Somerset #B3-04/05/06\n<br />▫️Bedok Point #02-05/06\n<br />▫️Bugis Junction #02-50\n<br />▫️Chinatown Point #01-43\n<br />▫️JEM #04-13/14\n<br />==========\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @chirchirsg for hosting and @justinfoodprints for the invite. #chirchirsg\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#korea #koreanfood #dakgalbi #foodsg #sgfood #instasg  #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #cafehoppingsg #yoursingapore #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats

-\n<br />New menu over at @chirchirsg has hatched and the Jjimdak is definitely my pick of the lot. Unlike other restaurants which braise their chicken, Chir Chir fries theirs so the skin has a little crisp, then steeps it along with tteokbokki in a pot of the most sumptuous sweet-and-savoury soy-based gravy. Beneath that mountain of beansprouts and spring onion are twirls of perfectly bouncy jjolmyeon (Korean wheat noodles) – even more delish when they’ve soaked up and are plump with the spicy sauce.\n<br />-\n<br />#jjimdak #stew #chicken #friedchicken #chimaek #chirchirsg #koreanfood #sgfood #food #foodporn #burpple #eatoutsg #superfluousadjectives
Fried chicken cooked in soyfish gravy, jjolmyeon, topokki and bean sprout ! Not exactly the same as the one in Korea, but this is equally good!\n<br />.\n<br />#foodspotting #bonappetit #setheats #burpple  #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #8dayseat #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #beautifulcuisines #onthetable #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #myfab5 #singaporeinsiders #vscofood #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #exploresingapore #onthetable #foodstagram #openricesg
A sneak peak into Chir Chir’s newest menu earlier this week got me hooked on their Pineapple Smoothie cause the heat was on! For those who love more fire in their food, their Spicy Jjimdak ($19.90 for half chicken/ $32.90 for whole chicken) features a lip-smacking spicy soy-based sauce, chewy jjolmyeon (Korean wheat noodles), topokki (rice cake) and a small mount of crunchy beansprouts. The star being the thinly battered chicken simmering in the stew - tender and juicy.
Roasted chicken thigh , spicy dakgalbi sauce, topokki and mozzarella! Pretty spicy so if you can’t take spicy food, you may want to prep some water! 😂 sinfully good!\n<br />.\n<br />#foodspotting #bonappetit #setheats #burpple  #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #8dayseat #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #beautifulcuisines #onthetable #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #myfab5 #singaporeinsiders #vscofood #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #exploresingapore #onthetable #foodstagram #openricesg

The chicken is really crispy and tender, and the sweet and spicy sauce really made this dish so appetising that I can\'t stop eating 😂😂😂... Maybe it\'s just me, I find the rice cake a little bit too tough, if not the entire dish is woo lala! \n<br />#chirchir #friedchicken #chicken #koreanfriedchicken #wati8thisweek #foodie #foodporn #foodjourney #jiakpahliao #burpple
This was really spicy, but i love it. There is my favourite squid and flat fish cake, yum! 👍🏻 3.5/5 ✔️I will visit again with my friends or family.

I love the spiciness and the freshness of the ingredients!! 😋

YUMMMMS. The chicken were a bit expensive though. Good for sharing with friends. \n<br />#chirchir #friedchicken #spicychicken #Burpple #Burpplesg
No is not bingsu. Tried #chirchir Korean chicken finally. The whipped cream is not disgusting type as imagined. It goes well with cheese &amp; their sauce. Mac &amp; cheese sauce was so spot on. Loved the spicy sweet chicken with sweetpotatoes &amp; rice cake too! All orders are very yummy but bill come up a bit shocking. Almost $100 for 3 ppls. 2main, 1 mac &amp; cheese and #mocktail .. I would say this will be occasional treat. Considering the calories better be occasional too. Hahas. Somemore we still can eat many more things after that. Dlted a few parts of my insta video half way.. arrrgghhh! #fridate #friday #triple #dinnerdate #godiva #sgfood #burpple #tgif

fret not, there\'s @chirchirsg in Chinatown point that opens till 3am daily. Perfect if you\'re out and about Chinatown doing last minute CNY shopping\n<br />●\n<br />Don\'t mind me as I put a wet blanket over their famous Nest Snow ($32.90) which had infested my instagram feed for months with images of golden brown chicken tenders sitting over a bed of cream sauce. Like a moth to a flame, I was drawn to the arresting visuals of golden brown topped with fresh whipped cream and shavings of Parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar; however, it all fell to pot when I realise that these spicy Cajun chicken tenders were incredibly unpalatable. It\'s mucked up dry innards, insubordinate with the hot plate of cheesy cream sauce below. A pool that resembled something similar to canned cream of chicken soup, unstirred. Yikes\n<br />●\n<br />More after the jump; to my blog of course. Fry-day just got real\n<br />●\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #friedchicken #sgfoodporn #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #chirchirSG #eyecandySorted

The love of my life: Chickens. &amp; chirchir made everything better. Good &amp; Quick service by the waiter and waitresses. In addition, tools were also given to aid with our \'food tasting\' (in other words, we ate the chickens without having to dirty our fingers!) The taste of the chickens is so delicious that i cant even find a word to describe it. Definitely worth the try! Whats more is that the receipt of the meal has both the total amount and the divided smaller amounts (according to the number of people present) to help with the calculations of splitting up the meal costs. love it 👍🏼
Much... Chicken... From top: Nest Snow ($32.90++), Garlic Roasted Chicken ($32.90++), Fried Spicy Chicken ($28.90++, slow burn spicy). Expensive but it was super worth it after using a Groupon. Would recommend the bottom 2 because the nest snow\'s amount of chicken was too underwhelming. Especially when it was the first dish to arrive in front of 4 ravenous girls. #koreanfriedchicken #chicken #chirchir #sgfood #sgrestaurant #burpple #korean

They also have almond slices, fried topokki (major love) and diced sweet potato.

The mojito slushie mixes well with the beer and actually tasted like a sweet cocktail. \n<br />#Singapore #igsg #sgig #sgeats #sgfood #cocktails #koreanfood #sgdrinks #mojito #cocktail #orchardroad #foodporn #beer #instafood #vscocam #vscofood #chirchir #orchardroad #exploresg #igdaily #igpic #koreanbeer #slushie #chill #foodies #sgfoodies #hungrygowheresg #hungrygowhere #y2eats #y2foodtrail #burpple

[Honey Grape Salad S$18.90]
... If it\'s for this #cheese #pasta with spicy #korean #friedchicken #tendercrisp, i may go back in line. We even made a fine dining version out of it @agphish @nazzayasin #food #burpple #chirchir
Wanted to know what was the hype about. If it\'s only for this #tendercrisp #chicken with #honeymustard, it\'s truly overrated. But.....
Chir chir Cajun chicken in cream cheese sauce- shiokkkkkk
Sooo cheesy 
We had the Mac &amp; Cheese,  Cheese French Fries and Garlicky Wings. The chicken wings are good for a group of 4, definitely not for two persons coz it\'s too big a portion for two... there are 7 wings and 7 drums! But it\'s indeed very chir-licious and satisfying! #chirchirsg #chirchirfusionchickenfactory #koreanfriedchicken #313somerset #lunch #whati8today #burpple #openricesg #sgigfoodies #sgfoodies #sgig #igsg #instasg #onthetable #foodphotography #foodstagram

Even Danbo is eyeing at the Chir Cream Beer ($13.90 for 350ml) but I guess he\'s too young to drink. A different kind of experience by serving draught Carlsberg with freshly whipped cream to go with Korean Fried Chicken.
The sauce coating, minced garlic and fried garlic goes so well with the proteins. Hidden beneath the heap, you can also find sweet potatoes and Korean rice cake that is mixed together with the chicken. For sure, this dish will scare the daylights out of any vampires.
It has 2 outlets currently at 313 Somerset and Bedok Point, with the former having a longer queuing time of at least an hour, especially during the weekends. One of the popular and photogenic dishes has got to be the Nest Snow ($32.90) that has spicy Cajun chicken tenders, on top of a rich cream sauce and sweet potato purée. To top it all off (literally), they added a ball of whipped cream and sprinkled cheese shavings. I had to scrap aside the whipped cream (not really a fan) and stop at 2 pieces as the cream sauce gets too heavy after a while. Also, making a special guest appearance, can you spot Danbo peeking hungrily at the Nest Snow?

Chir Chir sure hits the spot, with quality time spent!
The garlicky wings especially has me enraptured with the moist juicy meat, with a well fried and crisp exterior, and a powerful punch of garlic bits to lift all the flavours just a notch up! The spicy wings with the marinate infused rice cakes were similarly tasty and fulfilling :)\n<br />#garlicky #spicy #chickenwings #chirchirsg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodbunnies #food #foodporn #foodstagram #burrple

Garlicky chicken!!!
wings with their custom made tongs. spicy and crispy.
This is the all time favourite #nestsnow $32.90 . #Chicken tenders sitting on white cream source and buried on top #mashpotatoes. Somthibg special? The drop of whipped cream.  Smyou wouldntd imagine having fried chicken with whipped cream #but mixed it up and it\'s so good! A unique mix!! #friedchicken\n<br />#koreanfriedchicken #foodporn #foodpics #foodies #instasg #instafood #koreanfood #burpple #eatoutsg #instafoodsg #exploresg #orchardroad #chirchirsg
Felt the 🔥🔥🔥 growing with each bite (damn shiok) but maybe we will go for garlicky wings next time. 😛 Also love how tongs are provided for kiap-ing wings! V. impt for super mums who need to eat and look after the 👧 at da same time! #chirchirsg #치르치르 #korean #friedchicken #shiok #dinner #yum #omnomnom #milktail #sgfood #eatoutsg #foodporn #onthetable #instafoodsg #burpple #tgif-ed
Needed to go away for awhile and couldnt get to see the food come. \n<br />Photo credits: @meiqing_potty and @michellelimbo
however, as you scavage through the dish, you find that orange sweet potato purée below those chickens, the favorite part of de dish in my opinion.
lick me, opps, it.
The sauce actually goes really really well with the tender chickens
These juicy fried chickens are just too irresistible 😍
I recommend going in groups of at least 3-4, \'cause they\'ve only got 1 serving size for each dish and it\'s pretty generous! #ChirChirSG
😉😋

suggested Chir Chir (taken over the previous Ramenplay outlet) and off we go, greeted annyeong by the friendly staffs. Garlicky Tenders ($26.90), Mac &amp; Cheese ($9.90), Chir Cream Beer (1/2 Pint) and Peach Tea ($4.90) were our choice. the tenders were just right for 2 pax, mac &amp; cheese was not bad! Chir Chir is one of the popular chicken shops in S. Korea. Kamsamnida! le sigh when can i go back annyeong land again 😫! #chirchir #chirchirchicken #chicken #beer #koreanfood #macandcheese #chirchirsg #burpple #whati8today #8DAYSEat
