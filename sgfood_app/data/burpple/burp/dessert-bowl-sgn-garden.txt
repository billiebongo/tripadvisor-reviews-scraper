Really a hidden gem in serangoon gardens, which many may missed after their chomp chomp food expedition. Love their durian mousse, which my partner claims she could smell it across the street. The ambience of this no frill dessert shop is very HK-style. Not hard to tell from the many miniature street food and stalls decorating the shop which mimick HK\'s famous street food culture. I enjoyed this rich and really really delicious durian dessert and find it no less satisfying than the ones served at the famous The Edge buffet at Pan Pacific! At $5 its even more irresistible (hear that, you know who you are fellow burpplers). What is nice about their mousse is that it adds blended ice into the mousse purée to give it a slushy texture. Topping it off with a generous dollop of the puree from the king of fruits. 
As simple it may looks , this durian mousse ($5)its packed with not only people around but a poweful punch of durian mousse in every mouth consumed. Top it up with vanilla ice cream ($1) to make it a heavenly experience
There is no durian mousse like the one by Dessert Bowl. A combination of half frozen durian flesh and durian creme, this bowl promises mouthfuls of delight and shiokness. This is a perfect substitute of the real fruit itself! Aside from durian mousse, Dessert Bowl is also famous for its mango and strawberry desserts- mango aiyu and strawberry ice. 
Really love how strong the durian flavor is in every spoonful, and the fact that they used bittersweet durian. I kinda regretted adding that extra dollop of red beans because the durian mousse is so good I didn\'t want to give attention to anything else. 
After-dinner dessert/supper - Takeaway Durian Mousse from Dessert Bowl at Serangoon Gardens. Featuring my new pig wooden spoon. haha. Rich, smooth &amp; creamy durian mousse topped with durian flesh. My to-go place to satisfy my durian pengat craving! 
Not a durian lover but this durian mousse is so rich in flavor it deserves a thumbs up. Not forgetting the aiyu mango with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is equally awesome
You stink! Need I say more to this glorious bowl of durian mousse topped with the actual fruit!
I don\'t like durian, but the whole shop literally smells of it... 😵😵😵
I\'m not sure about the name but it\'s a mouthful! 
durian mousse!
mango pomelo!
milk custard!
Seafood grilled perfectly. You won\'t go wrong with the prawn and sotong grill. the best i\'veha had in sg.
too ribena-ish for me but my brother likes it
Can\'t miss this divine durian mousse in a dessert list (if you like durian of course).
Tried the 2 top popular choice which is the mango pomelo with sago as well as the creamy durian with pulp! Both were soothing with icy bits, not the smoothest but decent and refreshing. Having desserts with a view, of the streets? At least it was a peaceful street 😂 
.\n<br />.\n<br />I usually only come here for one thing and that is for their durian mousse. The durian mousse here is super yummy; very creamy yet not overly sweet nor rich which reduces the jelat-ness. You also have the option of adding $1 more for a double shot of durian.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphotography #sgfoodphotography #foodstagram #sgfoodstagram #instafood_sg #sgigfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgmakan #sgmakandiary #burpple #burpplesg #dessert #desserts #dessertporn #sgdessert #sgdesserts #dessertbowl #一碗甜品 #durianmousse #duriandessert
The durian mousse chose me.
Definitely #noregrets because it was SO good. Calling out to all durian lovers, you HAVE to try!!! The durian mousse was really smooth and icy (think of it as durian ice blend). The durian meat was really fresh too. We reccomend getting \"double shot durian mousse\" instead because who wouldn\'t want more durian meat?! The durian crepe on the other hand was average though, we were expecting a crispy crepe instead of a soft one. We will be back to have a bowl of durian mousse EACH.\n<br />⚊\n<br />✏#JaeplusKaeReviews\n<br />▪\n<br />💻 JaeplusKae.wordpress.com\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />#feedthetheme #igsg #singapore #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodporn #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #food #foodie #instafood #feedfeed #먹스타그램 #먹방 #먹스타 #yum #delicious #dessertporn #visualsoflife

Durian mousse with double shot of durian flesh, $6- Good!
It literally feels like slurping down durian puree with chunks of durian flesh on top. This is hands down the most enjoyable durian dessert I\'ve ever had so far and it makes me wonder if I can request for triple shot on my next visit 🤔\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #durian #food #dessert #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat

Guess I made the right choice to stick to durian. Didn\'t consider the other fresh fruit option, mango, which since we were told they were sour that day. Coincidentally the ones I bought from fairprice later were super sour too.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #dessert #desserbowl #burpple
