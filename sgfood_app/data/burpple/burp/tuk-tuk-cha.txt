Tuk Tuk Cha\'s signature is undoubtedly their Shibuya Toast, but if in any case you are just too filled for one or just simply have no space for a full-sized thick toast, then their Golden Toast would suit you better. The toast cubes comes crisp and buttery, completely soaked in buttered before being toasted just like their Shibuya Toasts. The homemade Taro Kaya is pretty much for taro lovers; a thick taro paste with coconut milk which is hard not to love, giving the toasts a light tinge of sweet, earthy flavour.
At $10.80, it comes with a thick buttery toast with a scoop of coconut ice cream on top and generous pixel dust of coconut shavings and coconut flesh. However, eating there can be a challenge due to space constraints and it\'s best for this dessert to be shared between 2-3 people to reduce the gelat-ness.
Can\'t resist getting this! Sweet Thai mangoes to go with the crispy, buttery toast. Didn\'t like the mango ice cream as much though. 
I\'m seriously in love with this toast. So buttery and fragrant, with a crispy exterior. Shiok! Coconut ice cream was not too bad and paired well to ease the sweetness. I actually prefer this compared to BKK After You\'s Shibuya toast. But what\'s up with the plastic fork and knife? Would be much better with proper plates and cutlery. 
Fresh coconut shavings and ice cream - very refreshing contrast to the sweet and buttery toast - sinfully delicious! Scoffed down in less than 5mins. If only calories didn\'t exist 😩
A lil\' Halloween indulgence that some-THING\'s been eyeing 👀🎃😈 Ft. Aloha coconut Shibuya 🍞 [$10.80] &amp; Thai milk tea [$2.80]. What an interesting Thai rendition of the thick toast wave! 😚 \n<br />Taste: 4.5/5 toast was golden &amp; crisp to perfection &amp; drinks were solid👌🏼 Ice cream refused to melt &amp; soak up the bread though.. Not sure if it\'s a good or bad thing 😹 nevertheless, something that irked us were the plastic \"plates\" &amp; cutlery. It was impossible to devour our toast without one of us helping to hold the plate down! Gotta minus points for dat 😅 \n<br />Ambience: 3.5/5 didn\'t expect the store to be so small - equivalent of the Polar puff kiosk nearby! Kitchen is even tinier LOL. Probably could fit at most 12 people? 😐 the Tuktuk &amp; Halloween decor were pretty cute! \n<br />Service: 4/5 while the toast took about 25 minutes to be done, drinks were much faster. Be prepared to wait during the busy weekend! 🌟🌟🌟🌟
#foodie #jiaklocal #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgfood
Perfectly crisp buttery cubes of toast with the kaya just redolent with Thai tea flavour. So worth it. 
This stall serves authentic Thai Milk tea. Suitable for those who miss a lot Thai drink like me 😭
I can never get enough of 🍞\n<br />Featuring one of my favourite Aloha Coconut Toast | $10.80 (Mango Tango Toast in the foreground) from #tuktukcha.
A right balance, the Thai milk teas\' at Tuk Tuk Cha are smooth and not overly sweet. Two of their recommended drinks, I do prefer the distinct Jasmine tea scent from the Thai Green Milk to the sweet Thai Milk Tea but both a refreshing drink and reasonably priced at $2.80.
The toast is crisp and buttery enough as a whole. I would say one of the better shibuya toast around locally. 🍞
Fresh coconut, rich coconut ice cream on a thick buttery toast.  Nice.
Crispy on the outside, buttery and pillowy soft inside. The young coconut pulp and ice cream went very nicely with the toast. 😘✨👌
What a cleaver idea! If you like Thai tea and toast with kaya then this is definitely for you. The toasted cubes are toasted with butter. The Thai tea kaya though not too thick nor creamy is still full of Thai tea flavor. It\'s a definite good breakfast or tea break. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 October 14
Finally popped by here to try this toast that has been much lauded by fellow foodies on Instagram. I now understand why they keep raving about these golden-brown cubes of buttered toast, crisped up so immaculately on all surfaces and around the edges while leaving the innards soft and fluffy. That pretty lavender-hued taro kaya was nicely done as well – creamy, with notes of yam that melded sweetly with the coconut jam. All that said, there was a greasy aftertaste that lingered and made me feel a tad queasy after my third or fourth piece. I may or may not return.
I don\'t mind the egg and floss… but the Tom Yum makes it a little weird.
➊ [Thai Milk Tea S$2.80/regular] - still my personal favourite! \n<br />➋ [Thai Green Milk Tea S$2.80/regular]
Well worth the money of $10.80. The coconut ice cream tastes like real coconut- not the preserved type. I usually don\'t like coconut but was impressed. Even the strips of coconut are young coconut slices. The thick toast is sweet and nicely toasted. 
This tastes awesome. I love the way the slight sweetness of the toast crunches in with the mango ice-cream and pieces of fresh mango. Cost is $10.80. 
Great tasting Mango sticky rice - light and yummy rice and sweet mangoes. All for the cheap price of $6. 
You can add $0.50 to add mango pearls and coconut jelly to your drinks. We added coconut jelly to the Lemongrass drink so you can see the colours. The regular-sized drinks cost $2.80 each. The lemongrass taste was really lemongrass. As for the milk tea, tastes like decent Thai milk tea (glad it\'s sweetened just nice and not overly sweet)
Though I like their effort of serving their fragrant pandan sticky rice warm, atop with sufficient coconut milk, it still seemed to be lacking in flavour.\n<br />I love this place, don\'t get me wrong. Just believe that I\'ve ordered the wrong item at the wrong time? Perhaps I should have just paid a few more bucks for their Matcha Shibuya Toast, &amp; maybe more milk tea.
Colleagues and I have been talking about it since @tuktukcha opened at #suntec. Coinciding with a colleague\'s last working day with the company today, I guess it\'s now or never. Love how this was served warm and fresh. Just the right flavours, textures and colours.. feels good, tastes good 😊
Definitely a quick fix when you want that coconut and fruity refreshment whilst shopping around Suntec. The rice was a little too mushy, but for the convenience, this was satisfying enough.
Adore their Green Milk Tea the most. I\'m not sure how they do it but instead of screaming all-matcha it was also quite jasmine to me - &amp; I love it! Every sip was a joy. 😊 Thank god for globalization.
Thai Black Tea goes well with the sweet Shibuya Toasts but my personal favorite is Thai Green Milk Tea. I could finish a large cup of this fragrant milky sweetness of happiness in a flash. 
Yes! I\'ve finally tried the Shibuya Toast that many are raving about. I regretted for  not trying Tuk Tuk Cha earlier because the toast is awesome! It is so crispy yet not oily (maybe because they use airfryer) and so heavenly sweet with all the mango goodness - mango ice cream, mango cubes, and mango sauce! Topped with condensed milk and boomzzz.. coz this satisfied the sweet-toothed me! I literally jotted down plans on my schedule to come back. Wahahaha 😁
Aloha Coconut shibuya toast seems to be the answer with a generous scoop of coconut ice cream, flesh and some desiccated coconut atop a really crispy toast. While it is not exactly the same toast as After You, we were definitely smitten by this considering its affordable price tag of S$10.80!
Very authentic Thai milk tea. Refreshingly nice. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 September 10
After seeing photos by @therantingpanda, then @aroimakmak, then @sgfoodonfoot in succession, I decided it was about damn time I gave it a try. And ohmyholymama, this was mindblowingly awesome. Crisp air-fried toast, liberally slathered with fragrant salted butter, topped with a scoop of delish coconut ice cream and generous shreds of young coconut flesh. Ermagawd.
Was a little scared when I read \"Tom Yum Toast\", but the hesitation turned out to be unwarranted. Tuk Tuk Cha\'s Tom Yum Toast with Chicken Floss &amp; Egg (S$3.50) was essentially a toastie encasing tom yum paste and your chosen fillings. Tasting like a cross between sambal and hae bi, the tom yum paste was nothing short of stunning! Together with the egg and floss, it made a simple yet delicious tea bite.
Thai Green milk tea in Sg?! Yes it is available and I love it better than the normal Thai milk tea we usually have. For those milk-tea lovers, give this a try and you might like it :) 
The air-fried golden toast had probably given its delectably crumbly innards a nice spray-on Lurpak butter tan as even one’s internal organs sometimes crave a nice summer glow for topless selfies and Instagram likes-collecting, etc. Elsewhere, the crunchy young coconut flesh tasted its primary school age and the coconut ice cream maintained its intrinsic integrity without selling out to milky sweet commerciality. 4/5 
The toast was rather disappointing! They were very generous with the milo powder but there was hardly any condensed milk found and so, it tasted kinda dry and flavourless? Perhaps it\'ll be wiser to go for their other toppings!
It was such a great disappointment when I queued for quite some time for this legit Thai milk tea which is raved by many people. Finally I tried it and both the milk tea is so diluted and tasteless. Overall, the price of one milk tea is reasonable, which cost $2.80 for a cup but the milk tea totally sucks. 
One of the cheapest and best Shibuya Toasts around — the toast is so buttery, it lingers on your lips for days (in a good way, of course). Go for their Mango or Coconut ones!
No. A THICK TOAST TOPPED WITH ICE CREAM.
The famous golden toast with condensed milk with milo powder($3.80) with an additional sauce: nutella($1) ! Yes.. The feel is so rich that I washed it down with a hand-made lemongrass to ease the \"gao-ness\" of the after-dinner-snack! 
Tried their shibuya toast before they launch, I must say this is a huge improvement 👍🏻👍🏻! [Aloha Coconut Shibuya Toast S$10.80] -buttery crispy toast 很香, wish I could toast this at home😍 Thanks Derrick for sharing the sin!
Tuk tuk tuk tuk...\" Please give way as the Matcha Red Bean Shibuya Toast [$10.80] comes to play. Like-a-shiok to find a real shibuya toast this time round and the skin is extremely crispy with butter fragrance embedded deep beneath. On a side note, I am impressed that this is done using an air-fryer which makes me so tempted to lay my hands on one to experiment.
😍 And the Matcha Shibuya toast was so crispy and sinfully good! 😋👍🏻
สวัสดี สิงคโปร์ (Hello Singapore)! Many Singaporeans who have went to Bangkok should have tried the widely acclaimed Shibuya thick toast from After You and left the cafe with positive reviews and came back to Singapore missing it even more. Back home, we can satisfy our thick toast cravings from places such as Stateland Cafe, Dazzling Cafe and the most affordable out of them, Toast Box. Recently, Tuk Tuk Cha, a Thai cafe opened by the Thai Boat Noodles at Bedok Point, launched their own version of thick toasts but unfortunately I was there one day earlier before their official launch. We had to settle for their Thai Toast ($3 per set) with Kaya and Taro dip ($0.80 each) and Thai Milk Tea (regular $2.80, large $3.20) which were all good. The Thai milk tea has the distinctive tea taste that you can get along the streets of Thailand which I suspect they might be using the Number One Brand Thai Tea brand. The toast was buttery and crispy, with the accompanying dips a good combination.

Their golden toast ($3.80) was crispy and buttery. We ordered the pandan kaya and an extra peanut butter sauce for $1.
Not quite understanding the rave over this. Pretty underwhelming. The toast felt oily despite being fried in an air fryer &amp; the Pandan topping was bland &amp; watery, $3.80 I won\'t be spending again. 
Another fail unfortunately, felt like drinking milk with barely a hint of tea flavour 😞
With 4 flavours available: Mango, Matcha, Coconut and Chocolate, indulge in one the closest version to After You.
Tuk Tuk Cha had finally launched their version of Shibuya Thick Toast yesterday with 4 different flavours of Mango Tango, Aloha Coconut, Tuk Tuk Matcha and Chocolate Goodies to choose from, after hearing so much feedback of expanding their popular golden toasts.
Tuk tuk cha has launched their version of Shibuya toast ($10.80) today! Here\'s the amazingly moist and buttery COCONUT TOAST. Topped with young coconut flesh, coconut flakes and a fat scoop of coconut ice cream, this buttery and crisp toast is one of the better ones I\'ve had so far, here in Singapore! Very affordable too!
Each bite size of the toast was crispy with a hint of crustiness on the outside accompanied by soft and fluffy texture on the inside! Best of all, they were lusciously coated with butter and well balanced with honey which resulted in a sweet symphony of flavours. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
The memorable air-fried golden toast (which I had earlier described as having the delectably crumbling crispiness of a century-embalmed Egyptian mummy) was gloriously buttery and elsewhere, the fleshy mango chunks and thick mango ice cream – easily able to pass off as the actual fruit’s slightly botoxed sister – just about prevented the indulgent toast experience from ever reaching sore throat heights. 4/5 
The office is exceptionally cold today! Just wanted to step out and get a breather before next meeting... 🐻\n<br />(The Tom Yam Toast, with chicken floss and egg, is spicy! Packs some heat!)
Interesting combination but the tom yum paste reminds me of Hae Bee Hiam (Spicy Dried Shrimps Sambal) instead. There is an option to add chicken floss too. \n<br />I prefer their buttery Golden toast than their savoury tom yum version. And yes, I like their Thai Milk Tea too. Not too sweet and smooth on the palate.
Buttered toast with Kaya dip. Bringing a bit of Thai to our daily Singapore life.
An alternative to local teh. Authentic taste of Thai milk tea with reduced sweetness 
First time drinking thai green milk tea and in love with it. It is so smooth and not so sweet. 
Of course this is incomparable to the real Thai Milk Tea ($2.80 for regular size) in Thailand. The Tom yum sandwich with chicken floss and egg ($3.50) is indeed worth trying! 
Or go all-out for the version smothered in condensed milk then topped off with Milo powder (both $3.80).\n<br />-\n<br />#TukTukChaSG is such a gem. I will definitely be back for more!
I just couldn\'t contain my curiosity after first seeing it. Air-fried, butter-coated, thick toast cubes with Thai Milk Tea kaya dip and Yam kaya dip. I like the latter, not too sweet, with a pretty decent flavour and crunch. Almost like munching on oversized croutons.
From the people behind Thai Boat Noodle at Bedok Point comes another Thai concept, Tuk Tuk Cha, known for their Thai milk tea drinks and sweet or savoury toast. A lovely tea-time treat is their Tom Yum Toast ($2.50) which comes nicely golden brown, sandwiching chicken floss or egg (or both). The toast that really steals the show, though, is their signature oh-so-crispy, air-fried Golden Toast ($3). This comes with dips like Thai tea kaya, taro kaya and condensed milk with Milo, which are available at an additional $0.80 per dip. Remember to pair your toast with Tuk Tuk Cha\'s super popular Thai Green Milk Tea ($2.80 for regular, $3.20 for large) or the superb iced Hojicha ($4.80)!
The air-fried golden toast had the delectably crumbling crispiness of a century-embalmed Egyptian mummy. Elsewhere, the dips ranged from rather vapid (Thai milk tea) to safe (kaya) to gao epic addictiveness with steep diminishing marginal returns (Milo condensed milk). 3.8/5 
Hojicha is a MUST TRY if you are fan of it!
From the people behind Thai Boat Noodle at Bedok Point comes another Thai concept, Tuk Tuk Cha, known for their Thai milk tea drinks and savoury desserts such as Tom Yum Toast ($2.50) and Mango Sticky Rice ($6).

Interesting fact: there is an actual tuk-tuk (auto rickshaw) parked inside for your seating pleasure!
The taro kaya taste unique but there\'s room of improvement for that &amp; for maple, it\'s of course the most common &amp; tastes good w/ whatever we are eating.#tuktukcha  #burpple
Tuk Tuk Cha now has a shibuya toast which comes with three different flavored ice cream: coconut, matcha and chocolate! The toast is a little dry in the middle and needs a bit more butter. The lady boss is receptive to feedback 👍🏼
Tender, nicely ripened sweet mangoes; fragrant pandan-flavoured sticky glutinous rice; and a generous blanket of creamy, decadent coconut sauce. I\'m defo not the authority on Mango Sticky Rice cause I haven\'t had much, but this is one of the best I\'ve tried. That and I love the vibrant tropical colours in this dish!
[Shibuya Thick Toast] which is going on the menu soon! I still prefer the golden toasts with dips.
Here\'s a slightly spicy [Tom Yum Toast S$2.50] with
These are the two most popular drinks served in Tuk Tuk Cha but I preferred the Cold Thai Green Milk Tea over the Cold Thai Milk Tea as it was richer in taste and had the right sweetness. A good balance of tea and milk taste. You can add another SGD 0.50 for assorted toppings such as pearls, aloe vera, coconut jelly and caramel jelly!
this bite sized toasted bread can be dipped with a variety of offerings.
😍😍 \"Cha-Yen\", Thai Ice Milk Tea taste almost similar to the one I had in Bangkok streetside.
Beside their signature Thai iced tea drinks, they also sell toast that reminds of After You\'s Shibuya Thick Toast from Bangkok which many are familiar with.
#TukTukCha specializes in Thai Tea &amp; Coffee, and they are also the sister outlet of Thai Boat Noodle. [Golden Toast S$3] with a variety of dips like Condensed Milk/ Condensed Milk + Milo/Maple Syrup. [Golden Toast S$3.80] with dips like Homemade Pandan Kaya/Homemade Taro Kaya/Strawberry/\n<br />Nutella / Peanut Butter/Apple. My favourite is Pandan Kaya dip! • ★🏢 Suntec City Tower 3 #02-605A
😎: Just opened and serving some awesome and legit Thai Milk Tea and I love their Thai Green Milk Tea the best!😌 Their drinks starts as cheap as $1.5!!\n<br />💰: S$2.80    \n<br />💯: [4/5] 
This Thai cafe/ kiok is located at Suntec City Tower 2 #02-605A, and it offers small bites and authentic Thai drinks. Hot favourites here are Thai Milk Tea and Thai Green Tea, both priced at $2.80. Also, if you are feeling peckish, opt for the Golden Toast ($3) which comes with a range of toppings for ($0.80 each), from homemade Thai tea kaya to taro kaya and condensed milk with milo. Personally, I like the homemade pandan kaya dip the most!
I guess we \"aunties\" gave our age away when we ordered the HOT instead of iced version 😝 Thai Milk Tea to go!
Another new store around the office! Going to swing by for some toasts and mango sticky rice next time. For now, Thai Milk Tea! 😊
Their thai milk tea is comparable to my favourite from Nam\'s but a sweeter and thicker thai tea flavour. This is closer to those on the streets of BKK. Their golden toast with condensed milk that is really crispy and soaked in buttery and sweet goodness😍
$3.80 for 9 cubes of nicely crisped, buttery toast. Opted for the pandan kaya which was really fragrant. Had wanted the taro Kaya but they weren\'t ready. Savory toasts are available too! This shop is opened by the same people behind the Thai Boat Noodles at Bedok Point. Check out their Facebook page for 1-for-1 drinks till 3 Jul!
New place for Thai milk tea and toasts! This Thai green milk tea is $2.80, not too sweet to me so I like it. Pretty good balance of tea and milk taste. Check out their Facebook page for 1-for-1 drinks till 3 Jul!
The Thai cafe offers a limited menu of Thai coffee, tea and desserts such as mango sticky rice and Thai style toasts.
Milo Toast from @tuktukcha 😍
Checked out their new coconut blend drinks series (only avail at suntec and novena outlets)- had Oreo coco which is a coconut ice blend with a mild Oreo aftertaste.
Tuk tuk cha’s shibuya toast is the way to go! ;) can never go wrong at any of its outlet:))))) for its price, it’s super worth it too;) #burpple #foodiesg #foodgramsg #foodinstagramsg #thaimilktea #tuktukchasg #burpplesg #foodlover #foodislife
Goes so well tgt :)
After eating this , I still prefer my Aloha coconut toast.
Ham and egg sandwich with black coffee for $3.50 pretty not bad at least for a quick fussy free breakfast. Luncheon meat sandwich taste not bad too and they are using pickles veg for the sandwich and not your usual salad greens.
Craving for Thai Tea. #teabreak #suntec #thaitea #thaimilktea
😊 #burpple
A thick hot Shibuya toast thoroughly flavoured in that salty-sweet butter and topped with shredded coconut, a generous scoop of coconut ice cream with coconut flakes. So heavenly to put the hot buttery toast with cold coconut ice cream and everything else into the mouth.

Toast goes really well with the dip , i personally find the kaya yam much nicer than the thai milk tea kaya . 
Mango sticky rice was more pricy ($6) but it was worth it . Rice was serve warm and mango was really sweet 
The toast is really good, crispy yet not oily. The green thai milk tea wasn\'t too sweet but I think my usual at golden shoe has a stronger taste. Run by real Thais so I guess it\'s legit? (Reminds me of the topic of authenticity in sociology of food)\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #thai #toast #buttertoast #thaimilktea #burpple
Crispy air-fried buttered toast accompanied by the refreshing coconut shavings and ice cream. Sure brings back memory from having Chatuchak\'s coconut ice cream! 😋

I love the strong coconut taste of the ice cream. I love the smooth texture of the yolk. I love how the 2 items blend so nicely together. 😉😋
Shouldn\'t really drink this when it\'s pouring outside and just after class but it was too hard to resist. I normally will go for Thai Green Milk Tea ($2.80 for regular, $3.20 for large) as it is sweeter and more smooth compared to normal Thai Milk Tea.

More satisfying than the toast offerings at Dazzling for less than half the price ($10.80)! ✨ Very cute concept at this shop with a tuk tuk furnished into a table 😍

but was slightly disappointed, it\'s too sweet for my liking. The Thai Green Milk Tea is a tad nicer but not fantastic too.
