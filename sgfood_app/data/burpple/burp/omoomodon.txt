In love. Even with their names. 😍 my diet is suppose to start soon...Tried JiJiDon and SpiChi. Rice bowl is more yumyum den udon. They have many choices of sauces and side dishes too. #omoomo #don #foodsg #burrple #igsg
Kimchi soup with kimchi omelette, soba and chicken karaage 😋 this place lets you customise your food orders at rather affordable prices and food is prepared quickly too!
Tobiko went surprisingly well when mixed together with the onsen egg and rice, it added a crunchy texture! One setback was the ordinary white rice, requires some sauce to go along with it. Overall was good, prices at NETT btw! 👌
