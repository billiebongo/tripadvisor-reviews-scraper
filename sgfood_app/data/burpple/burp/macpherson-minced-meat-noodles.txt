First time enjoying the BCM here. Springy noodle, robust broth with a hint of sweetness and perfectly cooked pork liver. .\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #burpple #sgfood #bakchormee #foodsg #noodle #noodlesoup #comfortfood #igsg #igsgfood #instafood_sg #instafoodsg #hungrygowhere #openricesg
Relocated 3 years ago from Tai Tiong to the same coffeeshop 天外天 occupies in the night along Serangoon Road. You probably won\'t think much about this stall as it doesn\'t \"seem\" to have that \"look\". I beg to differ after testing a bowl out. Generous portion even for $4, this stall packs a punch. Nicely flavored and yummy broth. Do expect to wait for at least 30 mins. At least you do not have to queue. I recommend this if you think you had tried most of the popular minced meat noodles in Singapore. Yumminess: 3.5/5
小碗面 - Al-dente mee kia (thin noodles) with special sauce, extra chilli,  flavourful stewed sliced mushrooms &amp; crispy pork lard. Comes with a big bowl of soup full of ingredients! Minced pork, pork slices, pork liver, fish cake,  hee giao (fish dumpling) &amp; egg in rich pork broth. My all-time favourite bak chor mee as the noodles don\'t have the \"kee\" (alkali) smell &amp; I love the soup so much I just have to finish it up everytime I visit!
Wanton mee!! Finally satisfied my cravings :) #singapore #food #instadaily #noodles
