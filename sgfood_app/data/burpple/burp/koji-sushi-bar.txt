Opting for brown rice with my order of Pork Cheek Don ($17++) for an additional $1, I wanted to reduce the guilt feelings of my CNY binge eating and have a somewhat healthier lunch. Atop the crunchy, chewy texture of the grains, were tender pork cheeks slices and a perfectly runny cold onsen egg to be mixed in then adding richness to the dish. Yum, will definitely be back to try Koji‚Äôs Unagi Don.
Super-duper throwback to lunch about a month ago at this CBD favourite. @alainlicious and @ccher thought the portions weren\'t filling enough, but I thought it was pretty good value!
The meticulous plating and quality of food presented far exceeds the price you pay. Looking at the menu, I definitely have to go for the Pork Cheek Rice Bowl ($17, upgrade to brown rice which happened to be a hot favourite for an additional $1).
Donburi rice set bowl for $17. I opted for brown rice (+$1) accompanied with onsen egg and generous serving of pork cheek. It will be good if there was more sauce to the rice. Will definitely be back to try their signature chirashi don. 
Okay, so I splurged a little and paid $9 more for some uni to top this bowl off. Topped with chunks of marinated sashimi, this bowl was full of flavour and texture. The crunchy jellyfish and crispy tempura bits added texture that was a pleasant surprise. There was also some minced tuna on top. Best thing? These dons ($17 originally, $26 with uni) are available for dinner too. Great place for some indulgence after a long day at work. 
Though touted to be their #1 cooked donburi, the Pork Cheek Rice Bowl was probably the least impressive among the three I\'ve tried. The poached egg was slightly overcooked, hence we didn\'t get that runny yolk which would have tied the dish together. Flavour-wise, the marriage of ingredients was acceptable, but nothing really stood out for me. The tender porky cheeks were probably the only redeeming factor. I\'d say, just go for the unagi rice bowl if you\'re looking for a lip-smacking intensely satisfying cooked donburi. \n<br />Koji is located at China Square, opposite the very popular Wang Dae Bak restaurant. The space is small, so do call for reservation is you are going with a big party. 
Still searching for a Chirashi bowl that can blow my mind like The Sushi Bar does.
The last time I had such good unagi rice bowl was in Japan! So imagine the satisfaction I had when I took my first mouthful.
Koji Sushi Bar is an extremely small hole-in-the-wall eatery located within the busy China Square Central area. This place serves to please hungry office workers looking for a great chirashi fix. At just $17, the Sashimi Rice bowl is a steal, with a generous portion of lightly marinated chunks of salmon, tuna, swordfish, yellowtail and jellyfish, topped with tempura bits to add a slight crunch. If you love uni, a top up of just $8 will get you fresh, creamy uni from Hokkaido. Opt for brown rice (additional $1) if you want something healthier, but the vinegared sushi rice does tie the entire dish together for a more satisfying bowl. Make reservations if you\'re coming for dinner, as seating is limited.
Sashimi Don ($17) with brown rice ($1) and addition top up for the yummy uni ($9). So good that I finished every single grain of rice. yums.

Very good quality Japanese rice bowl at pocket friendly price. Special mention to the rice cracker that provides an extra crunch blends well with the fish. Also each fish bowl has its own chef\'s special concoction of seasoning sauce to go along, down to the very precise drop. As a sauce eater, I requested for more and was REJECTED because they claimed the amount they added is the optimal, but this kind is personal preference leh. üò§üò§
I\'ve used ginger flowers in making rojak before and was pretty surprised it was used in this dish too. Fragrance of ginger flower was pretty appealing but there\'re still many better chirashi in the market.
A newly open casual sushi/sashimi joint in the CBD area.
Admittedly this was actually decent quality; tender pork cheek, subtly sweet rice doused in soy sauce and cold Onsen egg served atop, but after having the Don at DSTLLRY this seemed to be lacking a little something in flavour and felt pretty unexciting despite being a rather good bowl.
A good mix of salmon, tuna, hamachi, Ikura, jellyfish and even negitoroüòç All these goodness on top of a bed of fluffy rice with garnishing and little crispy crackers (tasted like keropok!) sprinkled on top! I must say this is such a steal for the price you pay.
After lunching here today, I totally get why this place is a hot favourite of the office crowd. Koji Sushi Bar offers an assortment of raw seafood rice bowls which make for a perfect light and healthy midday meal. The Sashimi Bowl I tried contained tuna, salmon, swordfish, yellowtail, strands of jellyfish, some Ikura and a mound of minced tuna. Crunchy bits of fried tempura batter, sprouts and freshly grated wasabi added the finishing touches. There\'s even a small salad and a bowl of clear soup included in the set. \n<br />Compared to Teppei\'s famous Bara Chirashi, the cubes of fish in Koji\'s Sashimi Bowl are cut a little smaller but they go lighter on the marination which I like, as I have found Teppei\'s a little too salty at times. Also, I chose to have brown rice for $1 more as I was curious how it would taste with the sashimi. Conclusion: Loved it! The nuttiness and chewy texture of the grains took my bliss to another level.\n
Loved the fresh salmon sashimi here, definitely coming back to give their omakase a go. We ordered a sashimi platter in addition to our donburi.
Almost everyone was having the Sashimi Rice bowl when I was there for lunch! Priced at $17, you have the option of white or brown rice. There was salmon, tuna, swordfish, yellowtail, jellyfish and tempura bits! I like how they have different textures in the bowl. The raw fish are lightly marinated, which was just right for me. This might just become my favorite chirashi don! (:
Opened by the team behind Shunjuu Izakaya and located within the busy China Square Central area, Koji Sushi Bar offers a selection of nigiri sushi, sashimi and omakase sets. However, their most popular item is their donburi (rice bowl) -- choose from options such as salmon avocado tartare, tuna tartare, pork cheek and eel. At $17 per bowl, they are one of the more affordable donburi options around, considering the quality of their ingredients. The must-try here would be their sashimi rice bowl - sashimi servings are generous and the crispy tempura bits add a surprising crunch factor.
Immediately savouring first love again, I indeed have the CHEEKS to say so. The pork cheeks so tender and soft, one bite and it breaks and melts in my mouth. It comes with a perfect onsen egg, when mixed with the rice and dipping the cheek into the runny yolk, so good you have to try it for yourself! Changed my white rice to brown rice for an additional $1, for an healthier more a filling lunch!  Indeed I came out of koji rubbing my rather round tummy.
A treasure box in a bowl - when served, I immediately took notice of the small mountain of negitoro topped on my bowl.... and unable to contain my squeal of excitement! As I start to dig into my treasure bowl, i find the usual suspects littered generously and fresh! The chopped fishes were mildly seasoned and when you add abit of wasabi and warm rice, it teleports you to heaven.... and then you take another mouth, till suddenly there\'s no more in the box. It\'s a sad and true story.
so fresh, a mean bowl of donburi. one of the better ones I\'ve eaten üòãüòã go before it gets overly crowded. don\'t say never intro üò¨üò¨
Koji Sushi Bar - Choose from a range of Donburi such as pork cheek rice bowl, tuna tartare rice bowl, salmon avocado tartare rice bowl, unagi rice bowl, salmon with roe rice bowl or the best selling sashimi rice bowl.
Unlike other commercial variants which have their sashimi grouped by type and forced to huddle and squeeze in a predetermined sitting plan, this chirashi don is so carefully put together, with aesthetic flourishes and all, you can almost feel the sakura blossoms flying in the wind, with Zhang Ziyi in the background. 4/5
It\'s only $17 topped with tempura crumbs. Add additional $8 for the Uni.
A bit confusing to find the place, but pretty affordable. Omakese starts from $68++ and has about 10 courses
Uni, Sea Bream, Swordfish, Sweet Ebi and Salmon
The beef was nicely marinated and not overly cooked. The set comes w a complimentary salad too.

Fresh, firm sashimi cubes atop a warm bowl of vinegared rice. Marinated by hand in soy sauce and sesame sauce, the seasoning was of the right amount, which helps to bring out the freshness of the fish. Smear a thin layer of freshly grated wasabi and you\'re all set for a great meal ahead. \n<br />Koji is located at China Square, opposite the very popular Wang Dae Bak restaurant.

Healthier option with brown rice heh \n<br />#vscocam #whati8today #ilovesashimi #omnomnom #burpple #whatdiet
The side salad that came alongside any of the Rice Bowls as a set meal. Leaves were fresh and the tomatoes were juicy and zesty, but the main point was the sesame dressing which was fragrantly spiked without overwhelming the dressing base!
