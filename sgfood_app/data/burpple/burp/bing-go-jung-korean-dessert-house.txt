Bing Go Jung was one of the first bingsu concepts to launch in Singapore, and they just recently opened their second outlet at Bukit Timah Plaza. Known for their generous portions and relatively affordable prices, gather four to five buddies and order the Injeolmi Bingsu ($11) with lots of chewy rice cakes and toasted almond flakes buried beneath the layer of soybean powder, as well as the Green Tea Bingsu ($11) with a dollop of red bean (azuki) paste, matcha ice cream and a sprinkling of cornflakes. If you love azuki, you can double the amount for an additional $1. They also serve a mochi-like Hotteok Waffle ($5) with chopped walnuts and almonds. 
Worth the price!!! Super big portion, me and my friend had a hard time finishing it 😂 Love the rice balls in the Injeolmi Bingsu! 
$11. Friends felt that it was overpriced, but I thought it was alright, although I prefer o\'ma spoon for their milk flakes. Portion was quite big and good texture with cornflakes, rice cakes etc. Tasted better with condensed milk, which we had to ask for. Also tried the green tea Bingsu which was quite light. 
$5. Not a fan cos it was very chewy and too sweet although the nuts did give a good crunch.
The O List
Some fuel after climbing at onsight. I would really appreciate if they give more red bean though. The ice cream was nice but tasted more like vanilla rather than milk. Still nice and refreshing in this hot weather :)
A petite waffle with chewy mochi like filling. The waffle was quite crisp on the outside but was quite tasteless. Thankfully the addition of maple syrup and toasted almond bits made it more palatable. Quite a small portion for $5.
Quite a light and refreshing dessert! The cheese was pretty mild and pleasant with bits of graham crackers to add crunch and flavour. Whip cream was a bit milky for me but fine when mixed into everything else. Priced at $13. 
Love the light, fragrant green tea here! The classic red bean paste plus green tea can do no wrong! You pour the condense milk in yourself so you can control the sweetness level. Ice was smooth but not pillowy enough. I hate it when stale nuts are used so thankfully the toasted walnuts and almond here were fresh! Priced at $11. 
These are 10 Bingsu found in Singapore! Check out the list http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/03/11/bingsu/
felt that it was not as good as nunsongyee, but it\'s almost half de price so I\'m not complaining! \n<br />this concludes the first episode of #takeSSout feat. @thesilverchef &amp; @paulineanghh. @fundamentally_flawed &amp; I have lined other bloggers and igers to take us out to their favorite makan spots. take tuned!
I couldn\'t stop eating this. I could just have the entire bowl by myself. Never get tired of eating this. Thought it\'s a little expensive, it\'s still worth the spent. $11 for a bowl of desert. Highly recommended flavour for Bing Su. 
I love bing sus and am so happy that I can finally get it in singapore! Although it\'s a bit out of the way.. I love how big the red beans are! Love how the cornflakes and nuts went with all the green tea ice. Felt that it would have been better with more red beans though. I actually paid an extra $1 for an extra serving of red beans.
The best bingsu in the east! Soothing ice and the red beans are really crunchy and sweet. The combo with milk and a scoop of vanilla ice cream kills it all...
would have been perfect if there were some chewy bits such as rice cake to complete the dessert.
Gigantic bowl of green tea bingsu!😋 added the rice cake damn chewy and quite fragrant. Shiok but we came here on a rainy day.. 
Lovely korean dessert cafe located right beside the korean bbq powerhouse - Ju Shin Jung. For those who are craving for Injeolmi Bingsu like I do after a long stay in Korea, this is the place to be! Injeolmi is similar to mochi from Japan and Bingsu is like our ice kacang (but with finer shaved ice). Injeolmi bingsu is covered with soybean powder which was what made me fall in love with this particular bingsu! There is also condensed milk accompanied for our own sweetening. For those who like bbq meat, you can consider dropping by for bbq lunch/dinner and then have some desserts here! (I also recommend the coffee and toasts 😉)
First time eating bingsu(팥빙수) and that caught me dumbfounded! &amp; look at that condensed milk flowing downnnn~
A korean version of ice kachang! A huge relief on a hot day 🌞🌞 Milk flavored shaved ice topped with red bean, corn flakes, rice cake and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Although I won\'t specially travel and go back for the dessert, but it\'s still worth a try if you\'re around the area. 
Closest thing to the real one that I can find in Singapore, how does your National Day dessert look like? 😁
At the rate I\'m going, I\'ll soon have their menu in my tummy. With the weather so hot, it\'s hard to resist a bowl of ice cold bingsu. Today, I try their coffee bingsu. My favorite\'s still injeolmi. All the other fanciful flavors have too much syrups which I\'m not a fan of. 
Today, I try their matcha azuki bingsoo which is a very popular combi when I was in Seoul earlier this year. Koreans have a thing for matcha and azuki now, you find matcha latte, azuki tea, matcha-azuki anything! The ice is shaved smoothly, azuki beans are soft and moist, not too sweet. The cornflakes decor kinda spoils the presentation, I\'m sure they could find something better, like almond flakes? Overall, seoulawesome! Now I know where to fix my bingsoo craving :)
Bing Go Jung Korean Dessert located just right beside the korean BBQ Ju Shin Jung. So right after a hot BBQ dinner, a bowl of cold bingsu for dessert was really apt. Injeolmi bingsu is the most traditional bingsu, shaved ice with rice cakes and soya bean powder. Although it couldn\'t match those in Seoul, it was good enough. The ice was soft and smooth, accompanied with crunchy almond flakes and chewy rice cakes. Nom nom nom.....
Bing Go Jung is a new Korean Dessert House by Ju Shin Jung, and takes up a separated area that used to be a dining area for the Korean BBQ restaurant. The Injeolmi Bingsu is their specialty, which is finely shaved ice with milk, soya bean powder and rice cakes inside, served with condensed milk at the side for those who want a bigger degree of sweetness to their dessert. Think of it as a Korean version of our Ice Kachang, which is delightful on a hot sunny day. Should serve two pretty well.

The assortment of flavours and textures complement each other well with the shaved ice below and the condensed milk poured over. \n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood  #burpplesg #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgeatout #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #singaporeinsiders #igfood #foodhunter #buzzfeast #sgcafefood #igfoodies #buzzfeedfood #foodiesg #foodie\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfoodies #foodphotography #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #nomnomsg #instasg #hungrygowhere #foodsg #sgfoodporn

Chewy Injoelmi Mochi waffle $5 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
:) Coffee Bingsu with walnut and cashew nut $11 
Bingsu! Korea shaved ice! This milk and red bean is good! The ice cream is sticky chewy kinda. And the crispy cornflakes give another kind of texture to this Bingsu! Open by the same boss who owns Ju Shin Jung. Very smart to open two outlets together and ample space to hold excessive crowd coming for desserts on a hot and humid day. But battling with the BBQ smoke not to stain on your clothings. Hahaha!! #bingsu #patbingsu #binggojung #koreandessert #shavedice
