Who doesn\'t like chilli crab? Their man tou is seriously good with the chilli crab sauce but I feel that the standard today is slightly different in taste than any other days that I have ordered here. Gravy was also lesser than usual. Nonetheless... this is still one of my favourite dish.
We wanted to get cereal prawns coz we tried butter prawns previously but they didn\'t have cereal prawns today 😧
My all time favourite \'must order\' whenever I dine here. One of the recommended dish here!
On most Sundays in my younger years, my family would make a short trip to Ban Leong to have a \'zi char\' dinner. Typically, the night will always start with a friendly chat with the lady boss, and a standard order of Har Cheong Gai, Nai Bai Cai, Hot Plate Tofu and a kilo of Black Pepper Chilli Crab. It was here that my dad taught me that the pincer is the best part, and if I were to choose the bigger pincer, I\'d have to share the upper part with someone else. He also taught me how to remove the meat from the legs using a magical chopstick so that nothing is wasted. It might sound like small things, but these dinners together showed me that relationships matter, especially with the lady boss ;) and to always share good food. Although there are many places that serve great crab, I will always choose to come here with friends because it never fails to remind me of warm memories with family. #hawkerpedia\n
First time here, on Father\'s Day. Many people so I guess that explain why the dishes came one after the other with a long interim. Overall the dishes are too salty (at least for me). 
Prawn Paste Chicken Wings (Har Cheong Gai) -Served pipping hot, the prawn paste marinade is good. It is so crispy on the outside, yet very juicy on the inside.
At this humble spot along Casuarina, you might just find some of the best crabs (at a really reasonable price) in Singapore. Butter crab, chili crab, pepper crab - take your pick. Also order the Hot Plate Beancurd and the La-la! Great for a satisfying meal with a bunch of friends you haven\'t seen in a while.

Today\'s dinner !! It was an amazing family dinner... First time traveling took 45mins on bus 😅 think it\'s at sembawang hills estate area.
What\'s better than a super solid zi char place? A super solid zi char place that serves excellent crab! Your meal will not be complete without their prawn paste chicken, and chili or pepper crabs. Come down with a bunch of friends for a nice rowdy catchup and get your hands dirty.
Though I was hoping it would be spicier, sauce was sweet with a slight tinge of chilli. It was quite nice.:D Crab was fresh and sweet. One of the best chilli crabs I had in Singapore.
The crab meat taste really sweet but the soup is a quite disappointing... Lack of oomph..
Dip the beef with chopped garlic+chili padi... It\'s yummylicious!!
A typical \"Zi char\" dinner at one of Singapore\'s well-known places. 
Reunion dinner with the awesome team.

[Media Tasting]\n<br />.\n<br />Was at @banleongwahhoe for an invited tasting, Tasted some of their signature crabs and dishes!\n<br />.\n<br />Tried @banleongwahhoe way before that, really very impressed by their food that are available on the menu!\n<br />.\n<br />Got to try their Chili and black pepper crabs! Both crabs were fulfilling, meat was good, fresh and definitely juicy! Chili sauce was sticky and starchy that sticks well to the fried bun! Black pepper was not overwhelming spicy too! Both taste good and tasty as an iconic dish!\n<br />.\n<br />Overall, the food served was really welcoming, warmth and family oriented. Delicious plate sharing dishes that caters to all generations! Love the food!!\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @banleongwahhoe for the food and @fnb_profits for the hosting and invite!☺️\n<br />---------------------------------------\n<br />#foodphotography\n<br />#foodstagram #foodiesg \n<br />#sgfood #singaporefoodie\n<br />#sgfoodie #discoversg \n<br />#foodpornsg #sgeats #foodsg\n<br />#sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfood \n<br />#foodporn #foodgasm \n<br />#explorefood #exploreflavours\n<br />#exploresg #instadaily\n<br />#instafood_sg #instafood \n<br />#instagood #iweeklyfood \n<br />#8dayseat #burpple
