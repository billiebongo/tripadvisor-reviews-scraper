FREE (sponsored) ICE CREAM for orientation last week!!! Grape yakult &amp; salted butterscotch! Grape yakult was refreshing, light and cool! Salted butterscotch had a lot of little biscuit bits. I think it\'s graham cookies haha. Very generous serving for bothüëçüèªyummehhhhüê∑
The folks at Merely Ice Cream are generous with their servings ‚Äî even their sampling spoon portions are huge! Go for the Red Velvet, or the elusive Breakfast Cereal if you\'re lucky.
Finally got to have this flavour after a year of missing it? Possibly my favourite here which is also inspired by Momofuku; the milky flavour came spiked with a granola/cereal saltiness which makes it so everlasting. Seeing this in the freezer after so long literally made me a kid that walked into an ice-cream shop all excited for the sweet treat ahead!
One of our favourite ice cream parlours and the best part is that its not so crowded despite its ice cream being so superb!
Delicious ice cream üç¶ Salted butterscotch has a nice crunch to it and is a great flavour üëç matcha is cooling üçµ
I love its texture, it\'s so smooth and creamy, just like eating a piece of butter. #throwback
The waffle may not look good or appetizing but it\'s really good. It\'s crispy, fluffy and has a nice buttery taste. And it\'s really cheap, only $6.50 for this.
had their salted butterscotch today!
I love asking ppl to bring me out to their favorite makan haunts. so that I can understand more about other people\'s taste.
Back again in less than 24 hours but this was a planned trip some time ago. We had the Earl Grey, Salted Butterscotch (which I had with the waffle yesterday), Horlicks Panda and White Chocolate Speculoo flavours. Earl Grey has a strong tea aroma to it that\'s pretty soothing for a hot day, while the White Chocolate Speculoo tasted of thick Milk Chocolate with cookie dough spiked with spices such as ginger and cinnamon though both flavours are a bit grainy due to its condiments. The Horlicks Panda is not a flavour that immediately appeals to most, but slowly lures you in with its malty taste with a hint of biscuit bit flavours.
Today\'s waffle came with Oreo Milk and Salted Butterscotch. Waffle is crisp and buttery, while the Salted Butterscotch replicates Salted Caramel but has butterscotch crumbles for a bite. Oreo Milk was rich with Oreo cookies and cream flavour with a milky twist, but the small bits that had the cream cheese was a tad odd to me somehow.
Red velvet and salted buttersotch!!\n<br />Will go back again to try out more interesting flavours üòç
I wanted to try this long time ago... but never had a chance to. Until one day, when i happened to be at bugis and woots, finally tried this! It was full house and im still delighted i managed to get mine while eating elsewhere. 
First time trying merely ice cream!!! The taste is unique yet addicting. One of the my best ice cream at the momentüòãüòã Will come back again for sure
Ice cream are generally thick and smooth and not icy. Chocolate flavour: Uses dark chocolate, bitter with tinge of sweetness. Yuzu Sorbet: Light and refreshing with tiny bits of zest Red Velvet Cake: Very unique taste of flavour, sourish sweet yet tinge of salty-ness. Cream cheese as ice cream base with chunks of red velvet cakes! Yums!
the first salted ice cream that doesn\'t taste like pure salt!! yay :-) I tried all the flavours and most of them are a bit watery though. 
Their ice cream was well flavored and firm. The waffle was crispy and light. Not a bad place to chill in the bugis area. \n<br />Merely Ice Cream\n<br />Sunshine Plaza\n<br />#01-13\n<br />91 Bencoolen Street\n<br />Singapore 189652\n<br />Mondays to Saturdays 12pm ‚Äì 11pm
Pretty good eat and interesting flavor combination.
I ordered 3 scoops but I request to separate 1 of it in a cup as it was a sorbet. Reasons why I choose these 2 because I go for the unique flavors! Peppermint mocha on the left and Gula Pandan on the right. If you see carefully, you can even see the green pandan sponge bits in the ice cream!!!
So spoilt for choices of what flavors of ice cream we should order. So my friend and I decided, each of us will order waffle with 3 scoop of ice creams of our choice. So this is what he ordered. Reason for choosing green tea, dark chocolate and vanilla was color contrast, take photo nicer! &gt;.
Headed back to Merely Ice Cream again, especially after realizing I missed their Root Beer Floay flavour on my previous visit. It\'s creamy, vanilla mixed with that root beer goodness; comes even with a bit of gassiness that is pretty intriguing!
It\'s incredible once you know what goes in this flavour; who would have thought that Butter, Dark Brown Sugar, Digestive Biscuits, Balsamic Vinegar and Seasalt can be mixed up for an ice-cream. What you get; a sufficiently milky sweet yet salted flavour profile, with crunchy bits of sweetness of digestive biscuits. Yum!
Pre-rehearsal and meeting with Martina at Merely Ice Cream at Sunshine Plaza. I had a scoop of the Hazelnut Kit Kat and Salted Butterscotch to go with a waffle and while I liked the flavours and generous serving, the ice-cream was a tad too icy. 
For unpretentious waffles with big scoops of ice cream, this is definitely the place to go! I super love their ice cream! It\'s neither too sweet nor overwhelming. And it\'s affordable as well! This cost 11.30!
Milk tea // horlicks panda &amp; waffle bowl, much needed on a day like thisüòä
OMG this place is so under-rated. The ice cream was full of flavor, not to mention that they\'ve a lot of unique flavors. Tried the Horlicks panda (Horlicks plus hello panda), earl grey and some salted caramel flavor (but I forget the name :-() I usually have waffles with my ice cream but they ran out that day!! This means I\'ve to go again right üòèüòè
$9, shared with 3 others. Milo chocolate fudge/rum &amp;raisin/ horlicks in one of the nicer cone bowl I\'ve had (eggy and crispy) had wanted to try their waffles but it wasn\'t available. Thought the rum&amp;raisin ice cream was really good.
Had red velvet &amp; salted butterscotch scoop of ice-cream with a deliciously warm waffle. \n<br />#TGIW
If you\'re looking for affordable yet really yummy ice cream, try out Merely Ice cream @ Sunshine Plaza! It\'s priced at about $6 for a scoop of ice-cream with waffles. üëç I\'d always describe Merely as \"as good as haagen daz\" when introducing it to my friends üòä Designers\' note: It\'s located near print shops, so when you\'re waiting to print or need to edit your work before printing, you can enjoy a scoop of ice cream üòâ
My best friend recommended me this place &amp; it\'s officially my favorite ice cream! It\'s not to sweet &amp; it definitely makes me feel good inside (despite the fact that I\'m feeling under the weather). The perfect place for some good ol\'waffles &amp; ice cream!üëç
Fluffy and crispy waffles. Pineapple Tart ice-cream tasted like the real deal with graham biscuits for the additional crunch. Red Velvet a well sought flavour which is limited production.
Double scoop ice cream for a hot day! \n<br />Red Velvet &amp; Peanut Butter flavour! S$5.60
Tried the icecream cafe @flawlessfleur recommended with @geraldinegisele! Had gula pandan and salted butterscotch icecream with waffles! Love it when the icecream melted and sipped into the waffles which make it more yummy! :)
My fav. #burpple #tingzieeats
Hadn\'t dropped by Merely Ice-Cream for the longest while so has to make my way there considering how near I was. There is simply nothing not to love for this flavour ‚Äî a medley of rose, lychee pur√©e and raspberry that was all lightly refreshing and pretty uplifting without the heaviness of dairy here
And what better choice other than Merely Ice Cream? Their red velvet flavour is exactly like popping frozen cheese frosting and cake bits into your mouth.
However, the odd thing about this place is that the prices weren\'t inclusive of gst, which is unlike many of the other ice cream shops ü§î
They were pretty packed on a Friday night at sunshine plaza. A great hang out spot for students nearby.

Yummy salted butterscotch ice cream from Merely. \n<br />#vscocam #vscofood #instafood #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #sgfood #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehopping #merelyicecream #merelysg #icecream #dessert #dessertsg #sgdessert #saltedbutterscotch #saltedbutterscotchicecream #waffles #waffle #igsg #sgig #burpple #singapore
Another flavour from Merely that does not disappoint! Not only were the coconut flavours rich and refreshing which helps in the sweltering heat of the late, there were also a lot of coconut fibers to bite on that also helped to enhance the flavours of the ice cream.
A quiet ice-cream parlour serving a comfortable selection of flavours, including an interesting Horlicks and Hello Panda combination. From tasting the Earl Grey and Horlicks + Hello Panda, I find the flavours here to be generally muted, but I like the Pistachio for the generous bits of nuts in the ice-cream though flavour-wise it definitely didn\'t match up to Alfero\'s super creamy super intense nuttiness. It is a nice place to chill though. I wouldn\'t mind coming back to try the other flavours :)
Gathering with friends over ice cream üç¶
My new found favourite ice cream bar.

Woke up feeling like a bad hangover but last night was really the best I\'ve had in 2015 so far. #dulcefan
Present to you the 3rd scoop of ice cream that I chose. Lychee Beer Sorbet! Many thumbs up!! Very interesting flavor! They uses Asahi, not too overpowering. Very refreshing, I like!!
