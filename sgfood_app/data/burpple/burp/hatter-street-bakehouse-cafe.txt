Love the way the waffle was done, crispy even after being  soaked in ice cream. Ordered the rum and raisin and chocolate ice cream (in picture) and both were quite good. Another waffle served with coffee and cookies n cream ice cream (not in picture) were not as good. Price is on the higher end. Place was quite cosy
Sadly their signature and much raved about pandan flavoured ice cream was absent during our visit, but at Hatter Street the waffles are not to be missed. Having their Whoa\'ffle (which was relatively larger than I imagined) paired with a creamy scoop of coconut ice cream and a good drizzle of gula melaka sauce, I really enjoyed their variation. Slightly on the crisp side and very much to my preference, the textures were consistent throughout and not at all dry. A sizable treat for $9.50, the waffles were also perfect to mop up the subtly sweet coconut ice cream and sauce. In all, this Alice In Wonderland inspired cafe is a pretty nice spot to drop by for some sweets with a small group of friends. 
Their cookies &amp; cream was rather  good but their chocolate was meh. Not much of a taste of chocolate though. But the cone was really crispy and nice! Noot too sweet, a perfect combi with the cookies &amp; cream!! Place was rather quiet &amp; cosy as well 👏🏻
Pandan ice cream with Gula Melaka Sauce Whoa\'ffles ($9.50)\n<br />Available at @HatterStreet\n<br />Don\'t know why but i felt the flavours of kaya in my mouth.
Sundae Hatter ($6) ~\n<br />$2.50 for the marshmallow rainbow ring waffle cone.\n<br />$3.50 for the single scoop of cookie &amp; cream ice cream\n<br />Hand model : @DianaSen\n<br />Available at @HatterStreet \n<br />It looked so pretty that we forgotten that we wanted charcoal cone.

I always thought that the waffle was on the small side (from the pictures) but nope, it\'s the huge scoop of ice cream that makes it look small. The Pandan ice cream was good, and my confused brain took a second to process that I was eating ice cream, not chiffon cake. The strong coconut milk taste reminded me of Kaya.
Tasty waffles with Cookies and Cream Ice Cream and Gula Melaka sauce. The waffles are SO GOOD. 
\"Is your waffle the crispy kind?\"
My VIRGIN WHOAFFLE despite it being just 10 minutes away from my home. HAHAHAHA!
Huge scoop of pandan ice cream and gula Melaka sauce on waffle. They serve decent waffle and the combination of ice cream and sauce is perfectly mixed! Le hubby loves their waffle which won\'t too soft. This is also their signature waffle. Value for money 👍🏻
Thanks @thearcticstar for the recommendation!!! Pandan ice cream waffle and espresso butterscotch syrup $9.50
Because the birthday girl wanted waffle instead of cake. No complaints because this is my go-to waffle! Iirc the sauce costs an additional 50 cents but seriously don\'t save on that because the gula melaka sauce really 画龙点睛 for (adds the finishing touch to) the waffle + pandan ice cream. Had the ice cream served separately so our waffle wouldn\'t go soggy.
Really overdue (considering that this is so near my place) - finally managed to try their waffles and I would say they live up to expectations! I liked that their waffles wasn\'t the typical, round, crispy-outside-fluffy-inside variation that we all know. The waffle is quite crispy throughout, but isn\'t tough, and is almost like a soft biscuit. Really liked the texture. But the most surprising and best part of this was their coconut sauce. Generously dribbled all over the dessert, it gave it a nice coconuty fragrance and added sweetness. The flavours really mixed well together, and I would say this was pretty good. Would definitely come back for more. 
Craving for some Whoaffles ($12.50 for double scoop with sauce) in this warm warm weather. I used to think their ice cream was subpar but it has improved by leaps and bounds. Now in a creamier texture and heavier density, I felt it is finally worthy enough to be sitting atop their crispy thin, Belgium waffle-like Whoaffles. Personally, I\'d recommend the Pandan flavour. Hatter Street is located at Hougang Street 21. Nearest train station being Kovan MRT. 
One of my top places to go to for waffles! My mum has a sweet tooth for waffles with ice cream recently and how could I not bring her here? Tastes as good as I remembered it to be. Crispy yet fluffy waffles, smooth ice cream and generous amount of sauce. Price is affordable too at $8.90! Surprised to see more ice cream flavors available but stick with this amazing combi here and you won\'t go wrong. 
Goodness. And @theshiokbook allows me to save while dining at my favorite places, with a 25% off at Hatter street. 😉
One of the few preset flavours for the ice-cream at Hatter Street. This one comes with coffee ice-cream and soya milk ice-cream (supposedly Pandan ice-cream but somehow got served another way), Kaya Toast, Ribbon Twist and Espresso Butterscotch. Coffee flavours were strong in here, especially from the ice-cream and the espresso butterscotch adds a little sweetness to the flavour. Ribbon twist harks back to childhood flavours, while the soya milk flavour was really reminiscent of the soya flavour and sugar syrup sprinkled with peanuts. One thing I wished that they are more aware of; peanuts should be served with a small description to warn about the content within the food item for peanut allergies exists and can lead to dire consequences
Yes please.
Dou Huay: soya ice cream, chin chow ice cream, butterfly fried dough, atap chee, peanut ah ballings, moo-jus. Essentially all that hawker-esque flavours topped with a sweetened evaporated milk sauce. The combination\'s really less exciting than it sounds. Ice-cold ah ballings were unpleasantly sticky with hardened peanut fillings; sauce was sweet and added nothing to the dessert; ice cream flavours though novel were overly sweet and not all that authentic. Nail in the coffin has to be the shocking icey texture - huge ice cream no-nos.
We had the Vanilla Whoaffles this time, quite disappointed with the vanilla ice cream, as it tasted really bland. Still impressed with how fluffy the waffles tasted tho. Its even better with the homemade salted caramel sauce. Maybe its time to try the other flavours 😋😋
Spending Saturday to the fullest, together with the girls having waffles and having 25% off the total bill, c/o @theshiokbook\n<br />• Whoaffles Pandan | $8.90\n<br />• Devil Matcha | $6\n<br />• Matcha Latte | $6\n<br />• Cafe Mocha | $6.30
One of the best waffles in town! Crispy and fluffy! It\'s simply irresistible. You got to head down to try it, if you havn\'t get the taste of it!
Pandan ice-cream with gula melaka Whoaffle. The waffle has got to be hands down one of the best I\'ve had and the flavours all compliment each other really well! 😋
Waffles is probably their signature dish in this cosy little cafe! Ordered their waffles topped with Pandan Ice Cream and Gula Melaka sauce ($8.90), and I must say it\'s really really good!! 😋 Their waffles are crisp and chewy, and it was clever to introduce the Gula Melaka sauce as it added a whole lot of flavour to the whole dish! They have three other options to choose from as well if you want to try others. Ordered their smoked sawdust pudding ($5) which tastes really creamy and kinda special (the sawdust smells like haze actually but when u eat it it\'s not too bad) Would go back again if I\'m around the area! :-) 
Whoaffles with Pandan Ice Cream and Gula Melaka Sauce. ($8.90) this is definitely worth the price! Crispy waffles paired with the frangrance of the pandan ice cream, everything was well matched together. Would definitely come back for this! 
These woah-ffles are called woah-ffles for a reason - They looked rather \"stiff\" to me on the outside, but it had a really nice crisp on the outside! The inside was on the dense side but not too heavy, so be sure to share this with your friends! The unique Pandan ice cream here was creamy and fragrant; you just can\'t stop your spoon from reaching out for it! 
Been some time since my first time having this, but the experience is still pretty magical. A smooth creamy pudding with crumbles that comes with a deep smoky incense-like flavour, and more crumbles at the bottom. Said to be inspired by the pastry chef\'s visit to Macau where she had a sawdust pudding right beside a temple which was blew incense fumes over, this dessert could be an acquired taste to the older generation, though if you are open enough you might find it a pretty intriguing combination that sounds weird, but pretty complimenting.
Hatter Street isn\'t particularly known for their modesty, as attested to by their signature WHOA-ffles, priced reasonably at $8.90.This huge slice of heaven more than walks the talk though, as it is just perfect. It\'s sweet enough, crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. Even after letting the delightfully sweet coffee ice cream throughly melt into every square of the Whoa-ffle and dragging it through the absolutely sinful espresso butterscotch sauce drizzled all over, it was still impressively crisp. Indeed, it has more than earned its title as the Whoa-ffle. As for the ice cream and bread on the side, it\'s an unidentified ice cream flavor with what I suspect are coconut chunks inside, and is Hatter Street\'s own SG50 promotion. The ice cream in bread definitely brings back all kinds of memories, and fair play to Hatter Street for that.

The waffle today was better than the one a had during my previous visits, probably because today\'s was crispier. Sadly, this was not enough to chase my \'Sunday night blues\' away. Where did my weekend go?!
I went whoa went the waffle came as I didn\'t expect it to be so huge! Very good height for a waffle! I\'m always excited by a beautifully made waffle. The waffle here is more of the super fluffy kind, slightly crisp outside, very substantial. Pandan ice cream was really good! Not too sweet and had a very light natural flavour. The pairing of gula melaka sauce, pandan and waffle didn\'t really convince me but I would gladly return to try their other offerings! 
When this was served, the staff cautioned that they smoked the biscuit so that it would have a smoky flavour. Quite interesting and after I popped the lid, smoke started escaping contributing to the wow factor. First bite... Hmmm. A bit of the smoked flavour. Very pleasant with the light vanilla whipped cream. My friend however, commented it was like eating from an ash tray. So it\'s probably not for everyone! 
Love their waffle with Pandan ice cream, it\'s perfect combination with pandan fragrant embedded in ice cream.
The waffles here are slightly heavier in nature. Toasted to a crisp. Much closer to a Belgium waffle. \n<br />The homemade panda ice cream is fragrant and light. It goes perfectly with the Gula Melaka sauce that is drizzled in abundance. \n<br />Simple kampung flavors for a trip back in time. \n<br />Monster is going to row his sampan there. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Pandan ice cream with hula Melaka sauce over waffles. (6/10) Vanilla ice cream with salted caramel sauce over waffles. (7/10)
I had heard so much about this waffle and I finally got to try it! And I enjoyed it thoroughly. Location is quite sucks though, also the place is tiny and cramped.
Bearing the name of the famous beverage from the wizarding world of Harry Potter, I had to try it to see what heir version of butter beer was. While I don\'t really know exactly what it was (I suspect it was milk-based), it was really sweet, creamy, with a strong hint of cinnamon and caramel. It is served warm, and is a rather comforting drink to have. You just can\'t stop at one sip! It is a little pricey though, costing $6. Nevertheless, still a nice sweet treat, and would definitely go back to try their waffles which this place is famous for!
Fantastic for a post dinner hang out. Get the pandan ice cream with gula melaka sauce. Aircon needs to be way stronger inside.
This has got to be one of them, Gula Melaka Waffle w Pandan IceCream 🙋🏻
Waffles were super crispy and yet soft at the same time! Pandan ice cream had a really unique taste plus the gula melaka complemented the whole waffle and ice cream really well!! Great for sharing with family and friends as the portion is quite big!
The ice cream goes very well with the waffle and the sauce!!! 
Walking distance from Kovan MRT, Hatter Street has already won the hearts of many with their whimsical touch and delightful array of cakes, waffles and drinks. While they don\'t serve savoury food, this is just the spot to visit during tea time or after dinner (they\'re open till 10pm). If waffles are what you\'re after, go for the seasalt or pandan gula melaka Whoaffles ($8.90). A must-try dessert is their Smoked Sawdust Pudding ($5) -- a truly innovative dessert of whipped milk pudding and biscuit crumble with a plume of aromatic smoke trapped in a jar!
Went visiting nearby so I had to drop by to satisfy some waffles craving. Didn\'t know they had a new butterscotch flavour one. Anyhow, still very much in love with this. Crispy and slightly denser than the ones I had in the past, but it was very fragrant along with the smoooooth pandan ice cream.
Ordered vanilla ice cream but wrong order came 🙊 but only found out when we were almost done with it but Who cares😂 It\'s super photo worthy and the waffle is great thought I didn\'t try the pandan ice cream cause I dislike it 😂🔫 service however was great
Pretty decent waffles that weren\'t too dry. Pandan ice cream which was served with it wasn\'t really to my liking though. Would\'ve preferred a different flavor 
The over-reviewed Hatter Street waffles, also one of my favorite waffles in Singapore. Crispy exterior and melt-in-the-mouth interior, topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled in salted caramel sauce, it\'s simply heaven in your mouth. Best way to have this is to pair it with their regular coffee which boast a roasty fragrance. Total damage to the wallet is approx $24 for 2 cups of coffee and 2 ice cream waffles. But it\'s so yummy, I\'d say it\'s $24 well spent ☺️☺️
Been hearing a lot about them. The waffles are crispy (just the way I liked it!) 
Luvin\' the texture of the waffle here! If you prefer buttery stuff, you will adore this more!
Light &amp; crispy waffle with subtle buttery taste which I adore and keep going back for. While I like the salted caramel sauce (one of the best I\'ve tried), the vanilla ice cream was decent and nothing to shout about. Gimme the pandan ice cream anytime! I wish they have a \"mix-and-match\" option where I can choose the ice cream flavour and sauce. Fussy Customer. hahaha. **UPDATE: Hatter Street replied that mix &amp; match is actually possible! Just request when ordering! Wheeeeee! Shall do that the next time round! 😊
Hatter street is a cafe designed after Alice in a Wonderland, and the atmosphere of the cafe is SO cute and definitely Instagram worthy! This cafe is situated in the midst of the Kovan/Hougang heartland, so for those living in this area, do try it!! \n<br />The flavors are very exotic as they brought in Asian flavors such as the Gula Melaka sauce and Pandan flavored icecream as shown in the picture 😍 Note that they only serve dessert, and nothing else!
WHY DID I CHOOSE TO DO THIS TO MYSELF, but ok lah, got it for 60 cents thanks to #wewantsugar!
Pandan ice cream and crispy waffles can nvr go wrong!! Topped with Gula Melaka sauce for more surprises. Total damage - $8.90 for waffles n icecream + $5.50 for the cake.
Very crispy waffles. I love every bite and will definitely be back to try other flavors!
容在嘴里，甜在心里 - melts in my mouth, sweet in the heart kind of feeling..... really good, no wonder it\'s their specialty dessert! Finally got to try it, and I\'m not disappointed at all! The canister opened up smoking 😲
The waffles are the crispy kind and not those crispy on the outside but fluffy in the inside. Also, the waffles are top up with fruits! Not many ice cream waffles have it though. It just makes you feel a lil less sinful after eating it doesnt it!
Witnessed a massive crowd queuing while we had dinner @Knuckles before hopping over to Hatter Street for Whoaffles w Pandan Ice-cream + Gula Melaka sauce &amp; a brownie named \'Alice\' which was Wonderland ( :
Waffle texture taste so right and crunchy along with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream. S$8.90 a plate. I say, aye aye! 
Ideal for those peanut butter lovers out there! This is a must try.
First mouth of the Pandan ice cream with the waffle made my eyes lit up! :) The crispy waffle with a just-right-chewy texture went really well with the ice cream and gula melaka sauce. Yum and I\'ll be back! 
#throwback
Light &amp; crispy waffle with creamy pandan ice cream &amp; gula melaka sauce. Easily one of the better waffles around. Whoaffles, indeed.
My favourite ice cream waffles next to Sunday Folks! 2nd time here too! I love love love the pandan ice cream! Too yummy. The pandan smell was strong and pleasant to the tastebuds! The waffles was crisp but maybe after it was made soggy by the ice cream, I wasn\'t as eager to clean it up. But definitely worth a try. And try their smoky sawdust pudding. 
The name says it all. It\'s either you love it or dislike it. The texture is alright but the overall is a little too sweet on the tooth 》$6
This was recommended by one of the staff. Kumquat in a tart. Not too bad but i\'m not a fan of tarts. I find that the tarts are too hard. We have difficulties slicing it 》$6
A cake made up with horlicks and ovaltine. This is one of the favourites among us. It\'s just too good that makes us crave for more 》$6
Despite all the rave online and also a fan of green tea but I refused to take a 2nd bite for this.
Waffle with Gula Melaka and pair it with a unique pandan flavour ice cream. This was so goodddd! I kinda prefer the texture of this waffle as compared to their Vanilla Ice Cream with Waffles drizzled in Salted Caramel. It\'s more moist. Green tea latte wise, it\'s better than Starbucks and taste exactly the same as my top favorite McCafe green tea latte. Just that it\'s too foamy that spoilt the drink by a little.
Matcha latte was meh. Hatter street is one of my top places to go for waffle fix. Can have this all day 😋
Taste is a unique blend of real pudding and cookings smoked in oven. Very beautifully and tastefully done.
$8.90 - buttery waffles but a little oily - Too small portion IMO, ice cream scooped can be bigger and have more toppings! 🍦
Pandan ice cream waffles with Gula Melaka ($8.9) - the waffles were crispy and full of eggy fragrance, the Gula Melaka sauce that was just the right amount of sweetness went well with the waffles. The flavor of the pandan ice cream however, was very subtle and it didn\'t quite work for me, tasted a little weird after a while. \n<br />Smoked sawdust pudding ($5) - I LOVE THIS!!! The pudding was light and tasted a lot like milk, the crumbs that came along with it was soft and airy 😌👍
Been more than 1 month since I had this! Miss miss miss! 💖💖💖
yes! finally got a chance to visit this chill neighbourhood cafe just behind kovan mrt. hatter street! a very vibrant, colourful cafe selling mostly desserts. pandan flavoured ice cream and it\'s real good. probably just flavourings because it ain\'t green. nonetheless it\'s quite delicious.  the waffles were crispy and airy too. 🙌🙌 4 hands from @shauneeie . on a side note, the drinks were meh 😕
Unusual name for a cake, but this triple layered chocolate cake will definitely satisfy your tastebuds.
Best waffles i\'ve had so far. Suprisingly found in one most secluded areas of Hougang,Kovan to be precise.
Finally tried the Whoaffles at Hatter Street. And yes it\'s the long weekend alr!!
Hardcore fan! Esp the pandan ice cream with gula melaka sauce! Hehehe! 😅😅😅 #hsselfie2014
Pandan ice cream sounded so weird but it went really well with the waffles x Gula Melaka sauce.
As Tastemaker Rachel Xie puts it, \"The waffles here are lighter and crisper on the outside than any other I\'ve had\". Well, you\'re in luck! Hatter Street will be showcasing their Whoaffles (waffles) at the Fest, alongside pandan ice cream with gula melaka, and their stunning Smoked Sawdust Pudding. This is them pushing the boundaries of food and flavours we\'ve come to regard as normal.
The waffles are well done, crispy outside and fluffy inside. Sauce and Ice cream was ideal combination. However, service was slow and can be improved.
Just the right amount of crisp around the edges....light &amp; fluffy. Perfect with pandan ice-cream.
Determined to eat clean but craving for last night\'s whoaaaaffles😒 which really lives up to its name as WHOA-ffles
One of the best homemade salted caramel sauces I\'ve ever had is liberally drizzled over crisp, light egg white waffles with a scoop of milky vanilla ice cream. 
*cue angels singing* \n<br />One of my favourite desserts here is a luscious pudding of milk, condensed milk and cream topped with super-fine crumble (hence the sawdust) and confined in a jar with aromatic smoke from burning wood chips. \n<br />#dessert #teatime #pudding #sawdust #crumble #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Pandan and gula melaka really works well with one and another but I find the ice cream really small compared to others. I quite like the unique shape of the waffle and I like it crispy on the outside too.
Smoked sawdust pudding- unique \'smell\' and no many ppl can accept this. Taste wise very close to brûlée I wish the crumbs on the top could have been more.
One of the better waffles around!! Pandan ice cream w gula melaka whoaffles. Went in, ate this all within 10 mins cos our seat at Lola\'s cafe was available after 1.5h wait 😂
Best item on the menu! Loved the interesting blend of flavours - a mix of asian (gula melaka) and western. Worth a journey to the north-east of Singapore
I like this more than their signature Pandan ice cream wz gula melaka.
A small little shop located behind Kovan hawker centre. Ordered Kick 来 Liao and passion fruit tart as all the other cakes sold out. The tart and the cake taste ok but quite small. Will come again to try other cakes or their waffle if I was around Kovan area next time. 
Mummy knows me best...craving for this the entire day and ta-dah! Shiok-a-licious! 😘😙😚
Waffles with salted caramel, strawberry and a scoop of vanilla ice cream ($8.90) I think this taste the best out of all the other flavors they have. Slightly overpriced and cafe is really small. Nevertheless I love the texture of the waffles, it is slightly on the crispier side.
Best waffle in singapore! Unlike most waffles with a doughy taste, this waffle is crispy on the outside and really soft and fluffy on the inside. Pandan, nothing can beat pandan 😱
Horlicks &amp; Ovaltine mousse cake that\'s smooth and creamy with layers of chocolate in between. Loved how the mousse turned out to be but the chocolate quite overpowered everything which was quite a pity.
Yummy waffles in a neighborhood! 
Desserts for lunch! Yum! Different substance kind of waffles and a kind more delicious
Lucky me got the last waffle for the day! The crispy exterior comes with a soft interior &amp; the self made ice cream complements it soooooooo well! Totally worth my late night supper splurge. 
Interesting looking whao\'ffles.  On its own, it tastes ordinary but with the pandan ice cream n gula melaka drizzle, they compliment each other to elevate the overall taste.
I fell in love with their waffles the first time I visited them. Decided to go a little more adventurous and ordered the waffles with gula Melaka sauce and kaya ice cream. Didn\'t quite like it as it gets a little \"gelat\" over time. The salted caramel still win hands down. Waffle is however crispy and fluffy. Priced at $8.90 the portion was a little small. Paired with iced latte and vanilla caramel tea. Nothing special on the drinks. 
Step 1: Pop popcorn.\n<br />Step 2: Purée popcorn. \n<br />Step 3: Mix popcorn purée with white chocolate mousse. \n<br />Step 4: Assemble with fluffy sponge cake and tadah! An ingenious layer cake with the sweetness of white chocolate and buttery (not oily) smoothness from the popcorn.\n<br />#cake #dessert #corn #chocolate #butter #sgfood #foodporn #hatterstreet #ilovemyjob
Punny! I love it! The waffles here are lighter and crisper on the outside than any other I\'ve had - the secret lies in the batter, which features only egg whites. I have nothing but praise for the homemade ice creams and sauces here, which are all made from scratch with quality ingredients. \n<br />You MUST try the salted caramel, which really is the salted caramel to beat. It hits just the right balance of sweet and salty, laced with rich buttery notes, and is neither too gluggy nor watery. 
I just knew I would love this cake the moment I heard its name. And sweep me off my feet it did, with its rich cheese infused with melted down nougat and peanut butter, topping of Snickers chunks, and drizzling of homemade caramel. Only improvement I\'d suggest is more butter in the digestive biscuit base.
Waffles with pandan ice cream was delicious! The pandan ice cream was a a tad too sweet for me. Brownie was not too bad. 
I\'ve got my eye on this promising two-month-old cakes and desserts shop, run by a single lady, Yvette. She\'s an ex-teacher with no professional culinary background, though she did spend four months at Michelin-starred molecular gastronomy outfit, Bo Innovation. What\'s mindblowing is her creativity paired with the technique to pull off her ideas. She actually took inspiration from the completely unappetizing smell of ignited joss sticks in Macau\'s temples, and turned it into this one-of-a-kind dessert of whipped milk pudding and fine biscuit crumble trapped with an aromatic puff of smoke from burning wood chips. Can someone say, genius?! 
Especially love the homemade feel of this cheesecake #cheesecake #dessert #snicker
A newly opened café which is worth a try, the food and atmosphere is great and the price is average. Good place to catch up, however the menu is limited eg waffles cannot customise.
Another view, I\'m sorry. \n<br />➍ [Snickers Cheesecake - they made it from scratch S$6]
Always happy to see these beautiful macarons. Flavors include Pineapple Tarts, Hawthorn &amp; Mandarin Peel with Chocolate
More sweet than sour with a citrus touch. Loved the crust which held up well enough yet not being too hard and carried some flavour as well. Meringue was lightly torched and provided a neutralising taste to the Kumquat curd.
Crispy batter but could have been tastier. Gula Melaka was subtl sweet but much was used for plating and not enough for the waffles; would appreciate
Aromatic vanilla scent as it came along, but each sip comes with a heavy tea flavour with just a hint of caramel in order not to ruin the tea.
Interesting dessert where the pudding and crumbs comes with a smoky flavour that sends your tastebuds on a rollercoaster ride.
Hatter Street cafe serves up an awesome waffles and ice cream combination perfect to finish off a meal. This combination is coconut ice cream atop waffles drizzled with Gula Melaka sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />The coconut ice cream is slightly icy, but pretty fragrant! Waffles are exceptionally crisp and light, definitely worth a visit!\n<br />_______________\n<br />Hatter Street\n<br />Blk 212 Hougang St 21\n<br />#01-333\n<br />Singapore 530212\n<br />.\n<br />#jiaklocal#instafoodsg #hawkersg #sgfoodporn #singaporeinsiders #foodiesg #tslmakan #eatoutsg #burpple #eatigosg #eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #dessertporn #dessertstagram #sweet #yum#hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #dojoeats

Back to one of my favourite waffles cafe  @hatterstreet ☺️
The whoaffles with gula melaka sauce($6)were really woah😍 The sauce requires $0.50 top-up. It was a huge, slightly crisp yet soft, aromatic waffle with a cute angular shape. We also ordered the brownie which comes with a scoop of cookies and cream ice-cream. The brownie was meh, tad bit dry and also not so much a brownie but rather a dry cake texture. The ice-cream paired really well with the brownie. Super cosy place to chill and catch-up!
This Choochi Monsta Whoaffles was their mix of cookies &amp; cream with peppermint chocolate chips gelato, decorated with more cookies and torched marshmallows. Perhaps these 2 flavours weren\'t good indication, but only wished that the ice cream could be creamier and smoother. Not exactly our favourite but maybe this combination would appeal more to those with sweet tooth. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #waffles #cookiesandcream #peppermintchocolate

Gotta try the waffles with pandan ice cream and gula melaka sauce. TD4. 
Very very nice!! Miss this a lot!
Arbo-ling (glutinous rice dumplings containing sesame and red bean) , atap seeds (immature seed of the Nipah palm that is candied, gluey and jellylike) and butterfly dough (fried dough fritters) are Singapore delights that will bring out the local child in you.
Lift your mood with dessert.

😃😍

So yay! 💁🏿
Yummy.  #latergram #wafflelicious #hawtwaitress #burpple
The Nutella tart is good as always, and the gaoness is pretty much neutralized by the light meringue top. The smores was dreadfully horrible, specially when the marshmallows were pre-roasted before leaving it in the chiller for display and served cold. The roasted marshmallow was back to being a normal marshmallow and defeated the purpose of its existence. The \"smores\" could have created a dessert to die for. 😓😓😓 #foodiemaxium #nomnomsg #openricesg #burpple #dessert #nutellatart #meringue #smores #marshmallow #hatterstreetcafe
Goes exceedingly well with the gula melaka sauce 🎉
Waffles at Hatter Street, just a few shops away from Nakhon Kitchen at Kovan, is less than $10 for the one you see on my picture. Cheap and Good! Remember to leave some space for desserts ;)
The waffles tasted alright only but the cafe with limited seats can get crowded even on weekday evenings. \n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #sgfood #sgeats #sgdeseerts #waffles #gelato #desserts #chocolate #hungrygowheresg #instafood_sg #vscocam #vscofood #igdaily #cafes #sgcafehop #cafehop #exploresg #instafood #hatterstreet #foodporn #foodgasm #y2eats #y2foodtrail #travel #travelgram #hatterstreet #sgfoodporn #burpple

Even the boy also said it\'s really 👍👍👍!
Crispy waffle surface, nice Gula Melaka source.
One of the greatest waffles, this is a must try!
Crispy waffle with Pandan ice-cream &amp; gula melaka sauce. Heavenly, perfect match.
Soft matcha latte cream, just a tad too sweet
Love the bitterness, just the amount of caffeine I need
Ice-cream wise, normal but their waffle is exceptionally crispy! 
Not bad, but there\'s better ones around
