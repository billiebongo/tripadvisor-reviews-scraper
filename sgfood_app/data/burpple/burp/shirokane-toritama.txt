Totally enjoyed ourselves eating different parts of chicken. Managed to try out a few new items too:-\n<br />*\n<br />Soroban (neck meat). Very juicy. I liked it much better than the otafuku (special cut of meat along the neck) which I found to be way too oily for me.\n<br />*\n<br />Sunagimo (gizzard). This was softer than I expected. I preferred the ginkawa (crunchy edge of the gizzard), which I had the last time I was here.\n<br />*\n<br />Ginnan (gingko nuts). Very tastyüòã and a good contrast to the unhealthy oily, oops juicy, meat which typically goes with yakitori.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #toritamasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Love these peppers
Made from the famous Aomori apples, the cider was sweet and refreshingly light.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #hgfoodie_alcohol #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Tender and juicy. Would have preferred them slightly more grilled but tasty nonetheless.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I have to admit that I was not impressed when it was served. I typically don\'t like my dons with minced meat. How wrong I was! This was absolutely delicious. The meat (including the minced meat) was tender and the overall taste with the runny onsen egg was sooo yummy. My daughter liked this better than the oyako don, which I already thought was very good.\n<br />*\n<br />@nantheless the Toritama don sounds similar to the Orihara don you had next door. Would definitely order this again.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It literally means parent (chicken) and child (egg) rice bowl. The meat was very tender and the fluffy egg with stock so yummy.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Another special order for $6.50. It was delicious but I didn\'t think it stood out. Most sticks were more reasonably priced at $3.50 to $5.00.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
These were grilled to perfection and were really sweet (for peppers of course). Happily chomped this down!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The 2 sticks on the left were tontoro pork with a pinch of wasabi on top while the single stick on the right was Iberian pork with a pinch of mustard on top. Both were equally yummy, the tontoro more tender and the Iberian pork more flavourful. Will definitely order again!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Thick cut and slightly chewy. Loved it!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokane #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Now that the cat was out of the bag and we knew they had special orders which were not on the menu, we ordered even more! The cheese was grilled until crisp. So yummy that my son insisted on having another stick to himself!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It is actually a semi-formed egg yolk (or ovary). You are meant to put the whole thing in your mouth. I found that too much of a mouthful so I popped one yolk and some meat at one go. The burst of warm molten yolk mixed with tender chicken meat was sublime!\n<br />*\n<br />This is a special order and not on the menu. I showed the server a picture of it being served at the Tokyo branch and she said they had it. It is usually only available on Fridays and Saturdays so you can imagine how thrilled I was as it was a Wednesday evening. It costs $6.50 a stick.\n<br />*\n<br />@blueskiescottonclouds and I have always wanted to try this and now that I have, I will definitely be back for more üòçüòçüòç. Next time with my eating buddies @blueskiescottonclouds and @veronicaphua üòä.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I usually like the neck meat but I found this special cut too fatty for me. I think I will stick to the soroban, which is the usual cut of neck meat.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Crispy and super tasty. Great as beer bites.\n<br />*\n<br />Instead of beer, we had sake. We had the Kikuhime Junmai Kinken, from Ishikawa prefecture, which I found to be elegant but with a full body. Lovely! We also ordered the Dassai Junmai Daiginjou 50 from Yamaguchi prefecture, which I didn\'t quite enjoy. It was a little too dry and light bodied.\n<br />*\n<br />I was thinking that I would order sake from Orihara, Toritama\'s sister company next door, during my next visit. Yes, we will be back! I was then told by @nantheless that you can do it the other way round, enjoy your sake next door and still order the yakitori. Thanks for the tip!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #toritamasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
You can eat almost any part of the chicken here. We immediately knew this place was a winner when we tasted our first few skewers!\n<br />*\n<br />Tsukune (chicken ball) made with meat and cartilage. Love the crunch!\n<br />*\n<br />Hatsu (heart) - I am biased because I love the texture of the heart üòç\n<br />*\n<br />Ginkawa (edge of the gizzard) - I loved this too as I love the crunchy edges üòç\n<br />*\n<br />Kashiwa (thigh) - yummy and tender\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_toritama #shirokanetoritama #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Verdict: luscious, creamy, and so much yaaassss.
Quite out of this world; and with the chicken soup, accompanied with copious amounts of Asahi Black and sake...a dream combination for a good night out. #burpplesg #burpple #ÊØèÂ§©happyhour #japanesefood
In truth, with chicken there is no where else ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Great food but better company. üòä glad we made the trip! #burpple #burpplesg #ÊØèÂ§©happyhour #japanesefood
Amazing food. 
This is undoubtably the best yakitori restaurant I\'ve ever been! They specialize in chicken! Yes! No part of the chicken goes to waste! If you can imagine it, it\'s there! Cockscomb, ovaries... Yes! But think egg yolks instead... Available only on Fridays and Saturdays, I\'d say... go for the chicken ovaries for an explosive sensation in your mouth! #lifechanging 
Love at first sight... Wz the windpipe.. Oops.
An unexpected texture... Hmmm
A foie gras alike... Juicy! It\'s Jz yummy ! 
You will either love it or hate it„ÄÇbut I love it!
Nice view seating at the counter.

Their signature dish, oishii!
Not bad but not worth the price.
