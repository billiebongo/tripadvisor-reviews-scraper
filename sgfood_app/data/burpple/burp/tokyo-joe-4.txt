Truffle Gyu Don. üêÆ The beef was really tender! Aside from that, there‚Äôs enoki mushrooms, caramelised onion, red ginger and onsen tamago! The truffle flavour wasn‚Äôt strong though. ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚ú®#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower
In this case, it is the chicken meat which explains the slightly pinkish red tint around the center. The dish didn‚Äôt stand out as we were already half done with the first two flavourful dishes.\n<br />Flavourful but not memorable enough.  #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #burpplesg #savourworld #latergram #japanese
The Truffle gyu don with onsen egg and premium bara chirashi don looks pretty good and didn‚Äôt disappoint the moment we started to dig in. The ambience of the location is comforting to the soul, like heading for comfort food and drinks after a long day at work. Suitable for office workers but in this case, the teaching staff from NUS or the hospital, NUH. Would love to come back for another visit if they did not close so early hopefully they will re-adjust their operating hours for Fridays and Saturdays.  #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #burpplesg #savourworld #latergram
Premium Bara Chirashi Don. ($22)  Big thank you to @burpple for the @savourworldsg  tour invite! I enjoyed myself even though I literally dk anyone. üòÇ This bowl of chirashi don had salmon, tuna, yellowtail, scallops, ikura, tobiko and tamagoyaki in it and were of many colours! Everything is so fresh too. üòçüç£üç±üçö ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚ú®#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower

If I were to compare this to other similar establishments based on taste ALONE, this would be above the average.
