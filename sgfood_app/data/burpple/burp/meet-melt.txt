So everyone has been talking about the very beautiful and artsy / Instagram worthy milkshake that some other cafe have. And in this cafe, they have it too! If you think travelling to town is far and you stay in the east / you study at TP, why not drop by this place to give their thick toast a try! Just opposite Junyuan Secondary School. Easy to get there and this place is CASH ONLY. Sauve ranging from Thai Milk Tea to Matcha Green Tea. Didn\'t regret having TMT👍🏻👍🏻
Thank you @meetandmelt for the additional scoop of chili crab ice cream on the house !\n<br />Really taste like chili crab sauce that\'s cold and spicy which goes well with the toasts/waffles, like dipping the buns into a chili crab
Damn, that lava flow is nasty. 🙀 The charcoal toast is good on its own too. However having it together w the light green milk tea filling, felt that this didn\'t work quite well hence would suggest going for the original toast. Anyway, #meetandmelt be moving to Scape on 17th July. 🍞
Like literally. People walking past the store were stopping at my table, asking me about the drinks, even taking photos of them! I swear I\'ve talked explained so much about these drinks I think I should be paid a mini commission for the advertising 😏 
Made with whole frozen nanas and no added sugars, this Nutella and Banana Milkshake is really more 🍌 than chocolatey, so rejoice 🍌 fans! Milkshake aside, the toppings are defo a straight route to diabetes. They make the whole dessert look really fun and enticing, but I\'ll suggest holding back on them processed sweets.
Do you guys see the amount of luscious Thai Green Tea filling pouring out of it?! INSANE. Fave part of this dessert has to be the toast though. So crispy, and totally liberal with the butter, it was super tasty, super fragrant, and super sinful. But sooooooo good. Owner Mr and Mrs Chan says the original brioche toast, which they ran out of, is crispier and their fave. I can\'t imagine how it can get better than this. The filling itself wasn\'t too bad, but much more bitter than what I expected. And it has an oddly foamy texture? Not bad, but can be improved on.
Enjoy your weekends with some yummy lava toasts in Ferrero Rocher or Thai Milk Tea sauce !\n<br />Fragrant smell of the green tea as you cut into an oozesome flow of lava! \n<br />On top of that, we really loved the New and improved gelato which are much smoother and creamy.\n<br />Thanks for the hospitality @meetandmelt ! enjoyed our time there as always!
Loving the Lava series by Meet &amp; Melt and this is their latest creation! \n<br />Thai Green Tea sauce which was very fragrant upon cutting open the crisp buttery toast and wasn\'t as sweet to my liking. \n<br />Also, their ice cream is worth a mention as I felt they have improved on the texture which is much smoother and creamy.
Matcha Toast $12.90, topped with a scoop of matcha gelato and azuki at the side. Toast was buttery but a tad too sweet to me, seems like sugar was added within the toast because we could feel the crunch in every bite. Matcha ice cream was light &amp; bland otherwise it would make a good toast. 🍞🍵 Anyway having the real deal tmr in bkk!
Cause this place aims to be insta worthy and stuff, let\'s list out the criteria to my review. 1. The assembly of the drink 2. taste 3. Location &amp; store. 
Another over the top milk shake, but this is a much better experience than those at Benjamin Browns. I like the fact that it isn\'t too sweet and the candies are aptly paired. At $14.90, it is a pretty decent treat with a group of friends on a hot, sweltering day. 
Ferrero Rocher and earl grey lavender ice cream on top of crisp fluffy toast. I love how their ice cream aren\'t too sweet, and the earl grey flavour is really strong. Highly recommended toast if you are in the vicinity! 
More and more cafes are opened serving Shibuya Toasts like Meet &amp; Melt that\'s tucked in the Tampines neighbourhood opposite Junyuan primary!\n<br />Meet and Melt is an ice cream parlour that serves not only ice cream but delicious Shibuya toasts, waffles and over the top milkshakes as well! Must be nice to open a shop ran by a family with a passion for food.\n<br />Here, we have a Shibuya Toast topped off with a scoop of Matcha ice cream and Matcha sauce, two wafer sticks, azuki beans and marshmallow on the side. Crisp and buttery Shibuya Toast goes really well with the flavourful Matcha that\'s not too sweet with a hint of bitterness of the Matcha that could be balanced off well with the azuki beans. Though, the ice cream had some icy bits which I felt could be better improved.. \n<br />Where : Blk 915 Tampines st 91 #01-49\n<br />s(520915)\n<br />Opening hours : \n<br />Daily 1500 - 2300\n<br />Monday closed
(1) Flavour: Charcoal Waffle + Salted Egg Yolk Ice Cream (2) Price: $13 (I think) (3) Rate: 5/5 because it is super good!!
It is much more filling than it looks. So skip a meal before you come! 😽👍\n<br />See full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/10/meet-melt-the-most-delicious-dessert-in-singapore/
I ordered the Ferrero Rocher toast and a companion of mine had the Cookies &amp; Cream toast. We waited for more than 20 minutes for our order to arrive. Yet, as we were waiting, the lady I approached was very polite when explaining that they had limited machines to make our order hence the waiting time. The toast was very crispy on the outside and soft in the inside, not only is it thick, but it\'s really buttery too. Maybe a little too buttery for those who aren\'t a fan of butter– like me. I would recommend to share the toast with another person as I couldn\'t finish it, despite my love for desserts. All in all, the toast was worth the travel for me. 
Yay, just a few minutes drive away from my house! ✌🏻️Not only do they serve the usual waffles, but they serve toast too! \n<br />Matcha ice cream with toast - Crispy and full of butter, one of the closest I can get to After You\'s thick toast! Hehehe, my tummy is happy! 😁
🎊\n<br />This is it! Our favourite item from a hidden gem @meetandmelt in Tampines. 100% homemade Shibuya toast topped with some special warm cookies and cream sauce drizzled over the toast, ice cream, as well as those over-the-top decorative garnishings. The flavour explosion that you will experience is really super shiok! You gotta try this awesome dessert 😄🍞🍦\n<br />See full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/10/meet-melt-the-most-delicious-dessert-in-singapore/
Need this sinfully Kinder Bueno Banana milkshake (SGD 12.90) badly to perk me up for the day.
Finally had the chance to try out this hidden gem, nestled next to a school, somewhere in Tampines.
Slatherings of Cookie cream with crushed Oreo cookie bits on it, stacked with Oreo goodness! The shake isn\'t overwhelmingly sweet and is definitely a guilty pleasure with its ridiculously indulgent nature!
Topped with a scoop of homemade Red Bean and Matcha ice cream respectively, and drizzled with their homemade green tea white chocolate sauce. Their toast is sugar-coated to achieve that crispy exterior while air frying and it is perfectly buttered with a soft and fluffy interior. The toast this time is just a lil sweet but the combination with these ice cream flavors help to lessen the sweetness of the toast. It is also served with heart-shaped candy sticks on it that helps to add colors to the presentation, and also sweeten your day!
Their newest toast, Green Tea Toast ($15.50) comes with 2 scoops of ice cream, red bean and matcha respectively! \n<br />This is then drizzled with homemade matcha sauce, with red beans and matcha red bean mochi served separately. \n<br />Love\'s in the air, since Vday is coming. U will have 2 cute little candy cones formed as heart 😂
Ordered their Ferrero Rocher Toast [$10.90] &amp; their Green Tea Toast [$15.90]. Iced Thai milk tea were on the house. So nice of them to save us during the hot weather last week. Toast are best shared with 2 pax, unless you\'re really hungry. Haha. Loving the rich chocolate flavour for the rocher and the bitter sweet green tea taste and of course the tasty red bean. \n<br />Thank you @meetandmelt
I\'m not really a fan of chocolate milkshakes, but this is an exception. The consistency of the milkshake was thick and tasted soooo chocolatey! They drizzled some chocolate flavour on the top which definitely was a plus point in terms of the appearance of the milkshake. Worth. The. Buy.👍👍👍👍👍
Been wanting to try this and I finally had the chance to. This is the Ferrero Rocher Toast, and it comes with one scoop of ice cream, and the flavour is of course Ferrero Rocher. So I decided to add on another scoop of ice cream which was the Cookies &amp; Cream. The ice cream, especially the Ferrero Rocher was so thick and rich in flavour. The toast had a buttery flavour and it was served warm, as it was toasted right on the spot after we placed our orders. The toast however was toasted till a perfect extent as it was crispy on the outside but soft and light on the inside. The service there was hella good, as the people working there were very friendly and polite. However, I would totally recommend you guys to come on an empty stomach because it was quite filling. Will totally be coming back for more👍
Situated just a 10 minute walk from Tampines MRT, this cafe is a hidden gem in the heartlands. Interesting choice of ice cream flavors such as cream cheese and truffle chocolate. 👍 The balance of this rendition of salted egg and charcoal flavors was spot on! Pair it with crispy and fluffy waffles and we have a winner! Not too salty and not too bitter. 👍 Unfortunately, my ice cream ran out before I was able to finish my toast and I was left with dry toast. 😢 However, I still had an enjoyable experience, especially with the friendly and helpful staff. 👍😊
$15.20 for Hershey\'s Cookies &amp; Cream Melt Toast + 2 Cappuccinos (Groupon deal)! +$2.60 for additional scoop of ice-cream, +$1 for iced Cappucino. Toast was buttery and crispy matching well with the ice-cream and sauce. Perfect for the sweet tooths out there.
i love eating ice cream when it\'s rainy 😍 we chose the popular Ferrero Rocher Toast [$12.90], and the Black Charcoal Waffle with White Truffle Ice Cream [$10.90], which is a new flavour that just came out yesterday! 
Tucked away in the heartlands of Tampines is this tiny promising ice cream shop. We tried their signature Ferrero Rocher Toast (S$10.90), which was surprisingly delish: a well-buttered superbly crisp thick toast, topped with a scoop of decent rocher ice cream and a variety of toppings. My only peeve is the slightly off ratio of bread to ice cream, leaving us loads of bread without enough accompanying ice cream. That aside this is an amazing Shibuya Toast that\'d put many cafés\' renditions to shame.
Besides their wonderful Shibuya toasts, Meet &amp; Melt does surprisingly amazing waffles. The waffles are wonderfully crisp on the outside, fluffy and moist on the inside. We topped our charcoal waffle with a scoop of salted egg ice cream and some salted egg sauce - talk about an overdose. The flavours are intense, rich, and the most authentic I\'ve tried. It really is the dessert embodiment of salted egg yolk, and not some watered down/overly sweet or salty flavour. The flavours are amazing, but consider sharing cause it can get a tad overwhelming.
As for the ice cream scoop, curry leaves\' taste was more distinctive than the salted egg. Slight overwhelming for me but still savoury 😃 • ✒️Sidenote: Lady boss &amp; her family are friendly people. Do give them your support if you\'re around the vicinity 😊 •
Here\'s a hidden gem in Tampines!! ($8.90) We opted for salted caramel ice cream which was smooth and rich; quite a good combination with the crispy and light pandan waffles without overpowering it (pandan taste was pretty subtle). They\'ve got charcoal, cookies and cream waffles and shibuya toasts! Warm and friendly staff, this little family-run shop is worth a try. 
(Won\'t name which one 😌)\n<br />Ferraro Rochor Toast - A rich scoop of Ferraro Rocher Ice Cream drizzled with Nutella/Ferraro Rocher Sauce. \n<br />The toast itself is extremely buttery, which suits my flavor and is crispy on the exterior as well as fluffy in the interior. Worth coming to this place for a shibuya toast craving! Not to forget the great service attitude from the staff here as well 😊\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
Waffle was good! Crispy on the exterior, salted egg yolk sauce was thick enough :) 
Thanks @meetandmelt &amp; @erintanhx for hosting this tasting quite awhile back!
Thanks @meetandmelt &amp; @erintanhx for hosting the other day! Aside from that, I really hate the army system! Rush to wait and wait to rush. Sighsssss
Here I am again having their new Ferrero Rocher Toast!
Love the thickness of the milkshake yet not too sweet, and packed with matcha flavor using a scoop of matcha powder and matcha ice cream in it. So fortunate of me to have a cafe near my house to hide away from the scorching sun! 😁😁😁
The sinfully pleasure of the Gooey Ferrero Rocher sauce always pleases, and the ice cream was rich and encompassed the smooth blend of chocolate and hazelnut. If you find it a tad too sweet, do pair it with the toast for a balanced taste. But honestly, the goodness of the sauce can go well with anything!\n<br />Find out more from my updated blogpost in my profile!
Drizzled with 2 sauces - peanut butter and matcha white chocolate sauce, lastly crowned with a scoop of Thai milk tea and pistachio ice cream respectively on the toast. Their toast is sugar-coated to achieve that crispy exterior while air frying and it is perfectly buttered on the inside. Definitely one of the better toast that I had after Tuk Tuk Cha!
Black charcoal waffle + salted egg yolk ice cream = match made in heaven! Haha! The waffles remained really very crispy throughout the long \"photo taking session\", and the salted egg yolk ice cream is just so good and distinctive, infusing with curry leaves that add accents and not overpowering to the palate. I foresee myself coming back here very often since it is just 5 mins walk from my house. 😁😁😁
Service crew are extremely friendly. Generous scoop of icecream 😋👍🏻 charcoal waffle with dark chocolate and expresso ice cream. 
It came with 2 pieces of squarish waffles with a scoop of salted egg yolk and enlivened with salted egg sauce.\n<br />This is the crispiest waffle that I ever tried and it was so crunchy that you can hear it break under your knife! The warm waffle remained crispy even after the ice cream melted and drenched the waffle.\n<br />Salted egg ice cream was infused with aromatic curry leaf, though could get a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of creamy salted egg flavour. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Similar to Shibuya toast, it came half with peanut butter and another half with matcha white chocolate. This was one of the better toasts that I have tried after Tuk Tuk Cha, with a crispy exterior and richly glazed butter on the interior! \n<br />In fact, the top layer tasted like a packet of toasted garlic bread that was so crunchy.\n<br />Find out more than the link in my profile!
Will u melt after eating their toast?
Meet &amp; Melt opened last month within the HDB blocks at Tampines, offering a selection of gelato/sorbet/waffle/shibuya toast (don\'t scream)
Meet and Melt! Ice creams, waffles and toast! While I am a waffle lover, they have a selection of waffles between the normal and the HULK! Yes! THE HULK waffle! Which is our favourite green pandan waffle! Served the waffle brownish from the outside, but greenish on the inside (Guess hulk human form vs Hulk form!) But still the toast surprised me, I thought of trying it, but did not know I will be loving it, it does look like a Shibuya toast, but the taste is different, SG or Thai saying \"same same but different\"? Homemade ice cream with surprising good quality ingredient, if you know about ingredient, just peek in on what are the brand they are using. They do huge scoop of ice cream for you. I came by after a meal and got his generous portion of toast and gigantic size scoop of ice creams! I couldn\'t resist but to ordered the pandan waffles with salted caramel ice cream. The portion of this two were too jumbo that it almost cause 3 adult to have a tummy explosion. You can have it as a main course!!!
Expectations-wise, this was akin to ordering carrot cake and then being served a fat beta-carotene orange stick with leaves intact and frosting on top. The “Shibuya Toast” was crispy and pleasingly buttery (albeit evoking minor Khong Guan biscuit feels) but it all felt a bit bargain bin compared to the likes of Tuk Tuk Cha’s magnificent Golden Toast although the experience was ultimately trashily satisfactory. Elsewhere, the ice cream was decent – man, the banana was certainly the dominant one in that relationship – albeit relatively icy, and the portion was more than generous. 3.4/5 
Had my first \"shibuya toast\" here! Ordered: Original lava melt toast with thai milk tea &amp; Ferrero Rocher ice cream scoop. It was marvelous! Price: $14.90 (if i\'m not wrong) and it was affordable for a toast and a scoop of ice cream(non premium) #desserts #shibuyatoast
😋😋 I want more please. 😆😆 #dessert #foodphotography #foodie #foodporn #foodsg #cafehopping #cafesg #desserthunting #burpplesg #burpple #meetandmelt #igsg #instafood #igers
The flavour of the radiant and blue ice cream reminds you of the dulcet bubblegum you have during your childhood days. Add rainbow rice and marshmallow to the mix to complete this incredibly sweet treat
👍🏻
Oozesome Thai milk tea sauce flowing out of the toast with interesting 🍦 to choose from like chili crab flavour ! \n<br />Do check them out ^^ !
Pretty good! Huge portion, $15 (7.5/10)
They will be moving to scape next month! 😛
Let it flow ~ Thai milk tea lava is not too sweet and balance off well with the buttery toast which is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Worth trying! ☝🏻️😋\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders  #thaimilktea #meetandmelt

Back here again for their toast, so yummy! 
The toast was sufficiently crispy, and the sweet (in a well balanced way) Thai milk tea sauce comes oozing out immediately when the toast is cut. Plus points for the super gau sauce, but I would have preferred if it was warmer when served. Truly a gem in the east housed under HDB blocks 💎✨✨👍🏻#Burpple #BurppleSG ##tslmakan #sgfoodies #igsg #8dayseat #SGMakanDiary #SGfooddiary #sgfoodtrends #meetandmeltcafe #meetandmeltsg #meetandmelt#roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition #thelocal5everpiggie

Off ice cream toast &amp; charcoal waffles 
Link on bio page •
👍🍞🍦
Had the vanilla flavour so that it wouldn\'t feel overwhelmed, and I was happily slurping away the creamy milkshake with bits of homemade chocolate sauce.
Best combination to satisfy my Salted Egg cravings!
Easties rejoice! Lol. We had this #charcoalwaffle with #saltedegg icecream recommended by the owner. Pretty decent #crispywaffles! I guess this salted egg and charcoal combo is the #waffle trend for now, not that I\'m complaining! Would probably try their thick toast next! #foodporn #meetandmelt
Nah, not anymore.
Love the bubblegum flavor so much!! 😋
This cafe is literally a 3 minutes walk from my house.
