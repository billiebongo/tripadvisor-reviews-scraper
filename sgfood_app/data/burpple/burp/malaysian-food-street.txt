No one, and I repeat‚Äîno one, should leave FOC without trying their paella. Tried and loved their squid ink version previously, and the paella range has since expanded to include more variants such as cod fish, red prawn, pork, and even a vegetarian one.
Way more delicious than it sounds. The juicy egg omelette arrived open-faced at the table, before being rolled and cut in popiah fashion before our eyes. Those black bits that you see? Not seaweed, but black truffle, holding its own with heady earthiness amidst the sea of cheesy, tangy, savoury goodness. Lip-smackingly good.
Calamari and feta cheese...who would have thought? And yet the harmony between the two impressed. The buttery, glazed goodness of the batter was balanced out by feta\'s sharp tang and stayed crisp throughout the passage of time.
I\'ve always been a fan of tomato-based gazpachos, but a beetroot one? That sure is refreshing in every sense of the word. It seems that their Sentosa branch tends to steer away from tradition, if the inventive tapas we\'ve had here is anything to go by.
If you\'re looking to have traditional patatas bravas (a hearty, greasy dish of cubed potatoes), this is not the one for you. Not that we weren\'t warned, though‚Äîthey did disclaim with that little \'Our\' on the menu. 
The turbot came recommended by the waitress and personally, I liked it a lot. Then again, I do have a soft spot for flatfish generally. The pristine looking white flesh of this one was firm and flaky. More importantly, it was well seasoned. \n<br />After being grilled, the whole fish was presented to us at our table before being swooped back to the kitchen. The chef then proceeded to slice and part the flesh in order to remove the centre bone. When that was done, he carefully folded the flesh back into place, so the turbot looked practically untouched when the waiter brought it to us to eat. The ladies were encouraged to have the fins as there\'s supposedly plenty of collagen found in them. And so we did üòÑ
What a world of difference FOC on Sentosa is in comparison to its other restaurants. Made up of a restaurant, bar and a couple of function rooms housed in a standalone massive structure, it is situated on Tanjong Beach with small pools out front. I love the look of the place - it\'s a cleverly done modern interpretation of a classic beach hut. When I was there with friends for dinner, the atmosphere felt relaxed and casual. The guests were in a mix of stylish beachwear and fashionably dressy attire. I guess it depended on where they had come from. In terms of food, we had a good meal with more hits than misses. But the misses weren\'t bad; they just paled in comparison to the hits.\n<br />For me, the standouts of our meal were the \"USA 365 Days-aged, Grain-fed Ribeye\" ($80++) and the \"Cauliflower with Pickles and Manchego\" ($16++).\n<br />Interestingly, the steak was served cut while the cauliflower remained whole. It was pretty obvious however, that they both got along damn well with \"foc\" (which means \"fire\" in Catalan) because after hanging out in its company on the grill, they tasted incredible.\n<br />The steak, which weighed in at 400 grammes, was extremely flavourful and juicy. The seasoning for it was also on point.\n<br />Before last night, I had never eaten cauliflower cooked whole like that and I was impressed by how sweet and moist it was. The high heat really brought out its best. Kind of like a good piece of meat I guess üòÅ Don\'t expect this dish to be cheesy though as the vegetable is the star here, not the Manchego.
This Spanish take on bread with tomato is my must-have whenever I am at any FOC.\n<br />The crispness of the light toasted bread is perked up by a drizzle of olive oil and tangy tomato that has a touch of garlic. Simple but oh-so-brilliant.
Went to this newly beach club and restaurant on the weekend after it opened, can\'t go wrong with its jamon iberico, while the tomato bread was not as good as i had in another restaurant where some of the staff worked before. The tomato used seemed to be unriped local tomatoes, but the bread is delicious and crispy. Had also fried calamari and feta cheese which was brilliant (not in the picture), however the portion is a bit too small, but hey, it\'s tapas anyway üòâ\n<br />Will definitely come back again to try other tapas, slightly later after letting it develop further. Should be good for a weekend chill by the beach as soon as they have the sun beds.

One that has a slightly chewy texture yet just melts in your mouth
Would be better if it was lightly seared
so we did, and it was good. #todaywasagoodday #sneakyfamilytime .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #8dayseats #noms #tasty #foodadventures #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn
