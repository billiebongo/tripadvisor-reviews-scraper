Queuing for this roast meat. Does it really worth S$3.5m? Will have to try.... 
Don\'t expect sauce flooding the plate of meat in this place. The sauce is cooked into the meat and it is sweet and delicious!! The meat is soft because of the fatty bits within that keeps it moist!! 
crispy and sweet, this mouth watering char siu truly is the most delicious in Singapore! go for the dipping sauce;) *the sio bak is fine by the way
Honey glazed pork ribs. 40mins wait..and all it took was 15mins to savor all in ...
There\'s always a genuine concern that when stalls get commercialized, the food quality will drop considerably --but not [Kay Lee]. Their charred char siew remains rather sublime: A nice bitter crunch, coupled with an excellent fat-to-meat ratio. But the real deal is the sauce they ladle quite generously onto the rice -- indescribably delectable, it can be a dish in itself. Step aside Hawker Chan, this is the real 1- 🌟 dish.
Nubbad but abit too fatty though! \n<br />#sgfood #igsg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #whati8today #charsiew #roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition #roastpork #kaylee #burpple #burpplesg #tslmakan #stfoodtrending

Found the meats a little too dry but at least it was tasty!

Some may say it\'s overrated, expensive or a drop in quality (after the 4million acquisition from the Aztech Group), the fact stills remain that it\'s one of the best in Singapore, especially the char siew. Charred with a smokey flavour, sweetness from the honey and ratio of fats to meat makes the char siew super addictive. It costs $30 for the Duo Meat Combination (Char Siew and Roast Pork) for 3 pax.
Love the flavours (surprising mild) and the charred texture
Yummy yummy Chao ta 叉烧! I like~
叉烧烧肉饭. This is my fav most caramelized + chao-ta stall! Crispy Sweetified Goodness! Happy Boxing Day Lunch!
remember to ask for more sauce - is thick but not too starchy, fragrant and o so addictive!
