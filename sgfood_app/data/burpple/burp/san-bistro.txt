This little hidden gem tucked away on Eastwood Road is one of Bedok\'s best kept secrets. The unbelievably affordable price tag on their lunch sets ($23 for two-course and $28 for three-course) makes this a great place to host a business lunch in the east without burning a hole in your wallet. It also helps that the friendly service staff are impeccably dressed, and that the food comes highly recommended by Burpple Tastemakers. There are multiple options for each course, of which the light yet flavoursome French Onion Soup and the Pan-seared Barramundi (top up $3) impressed us the most. The latter, which comes with an delightfully crispy skin, requires a top-up of $3 (totally worth it). End your meal with the decadent Double Fudge Chocolate Gateau that comes topped with crunchy chocolate pearls and cocoa nibs. \n<br />Avg Price: $30 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Dex Neo\n<br />Reservations available via Burpple
4.5 munchies: Handmade farfalle served with duck confit, black trumpet mushroom, aged Comt√©, and black truffle shavings. Not only did I absolutely devour the crispy duck skin and juicy meat, the rich, savoury broth was also packed with umami goodness and earthiness from both the truffles and mushrooms! Before you think the flavours might get all too heavy in this dish, the tartness of the sweet-pickled fennel made a brilliant garnish to balance out the salt. #Burpproved

Hard to go wrong with this: dark chocolate sponge topped with chocolate fudge, mousse and crunchy pearls. The cocoa nibs tuile was more of a caramel brittle though, so while it provided some textural contrast, it introduced more sweetness too. 
Back at San Bistro, this time for their crazy, value-for-money lunch set! After some pretty awesome appetizers, this pan-seared barramundi (+$3) continued to delight.üêü
Don\'t let the extra $3 for this option dissuade you if you\'re opting for the lunch set ($18/$23 for 2/3 courses), I promise it\'ll be worth it!
One of the mains available at San Bistro\'s super worth lunch sets, this duck leg confit on risoni pasta was mmm mm mmmmm... üëå
I usually find French onion soups a little hard to finish on my own, but with no bread layering or gratin√©eing here, you get to enjoy the broth\'s depth of flavour from caramelised onions and veal jus on its own. 
It\'s easy for velout√©s to get cloyingly rich but this wasn\'t. You still get the creamy texture but the charred cauliflower florets break the monotony. Love the nutty notes from the brown butter too! 
While not totally wild about it yet, I have a newfound appreciation for Foie Gras au Torchon, from the laborious process (deveining, curing and all) to its delicately sweet, one-of-a-kind flavour and amazingly creamy mouthfeel. There are many ways to enjoy this, on its own with accompanying sourdough crisps, or add some pizzazz with a little bit of everything: berry jam, peanut butter, horseradish dust, and nitrogen apple calvados mousse. Kudos to Chef Josh for making classics great again with his creative flair. #burpple #burpproved #sanbistrosg
Before waxing lyrical about this gem tucked in an ulu part of Bedok, can I just put it out there that every single dish (we had 11) was a hit with our taste buds, and I\'m not saying this because it was an invited tasting.
At first glance, I thought this would probably be too cloying. But looking at the cleaned plate after, I was clearly wrong. üòÇ
Housemade pasta with a crisp duck confit, umami-ness of black trumpet mushrooms permeating the viscous sauce, finished with sweet-pickled fennel, aged Comte and shaved black truffles. I\'m a legitimate sucker for rich-flavoured pastas done well.\n<br />Though tucked in a decidedly hidden spot, @sanbistrosg\'s fine setting, meticulous wait staff and talented chefs sure made our meal an excellent experience. \n<br />Still undecided where to take your partner this Valentines? Here\'s your answer ü•Ç (psst, they\'ve got a fixed dinner menu specially planned for 12&amp;14Feb)
Located along a sleepy area in the east of SG, San Bistro wowed us the whole night with their food and service. üëè
Extracted from the highly prized crustacean, essence of Canadian Lobsters, made into the most luxurious, intensely flavoured medium-napp√© broth. Every sip is silky smooth. To die for. \n<br />Served with a Lobster knuckle stuffed Raviolo, sweet tender flesh of a single claw, charred corn and pearls of Ikura for an extra savoury pop. \n<br />This has got to be one of the best tasting Lobster Bisques I\'ve ever been so blessed to have. üí´
I relished the food so much during this tasting that I suggested the place for an upcoming gathering with Eastie friends!\n<br />:\n<br />Every dish showcased a facet of the multi-dimensional creativity from Chef Josh Chua, from crispy thin cones made of sakura ebi, to cracking open a nitrogen-frozen apple calvados mousse to savour with duck liver p√¢t√© and peanut butter (??).\n<br />:\n<br />All the lobster dishes left us starfish-eyed. The bisque, paler than the familiar deep orange, was deceptively saturated with the crustacean\'s essence, and if that wasn\'t enough, the centrepiece ravioli has knuckle meat stuffed in it, and a naked seductive claw on top. The Canadian Lobster - Warm &amp; Cold demonstrates versatility, you can have the tail doused in asian spices, and lobster coral frozen and adorn as crumbly soil on the plate, AND drink down the rich consomm√© with risoni. Almost no wastage.\n<br />:\n<br />The truffle and duck farfalle has been raved about by my fellow Tastemakers in the Burpple app, and I high-five their sentiments. The bow-tie pasta was handmade and truffle-infused, then dressed over with black trumpet mushrooms, aged comte and black truffle shavings, pickled fennel and arugula. This posh gentleman led our tastebuds into a waltz, gliding over the thick mushroom flavour emanating from the sauce, spinning around the crisp duck confit, and then ending with a satisfying lick of the lips.\n<br />:\n<br />End your meal with either the Chocolate orb, or the summery Citrus dessert. The latter is super refreshing, and more sweet than tart from the combination of orange, lime and cucumber in fruit, sorbet, curd and foam.\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the invite, and @sanbistrosg having us! #Burpple #Burpproved
Can\'t get enough of the high quality lunch sets here (2/3 course for $18/23++) ! Second time here in two weeks, topped up $3 for the American breakfast this time, which came with eggs ben, croissant, shrooms, cheese sausage, grilled tomato and bacon. Oh and a side salad if you want to pretend to be healthy. 
Too milky. Still prefer the French onion soup or the charred butterhead lettuce salad as a starter. 
Located at Eastwood (the mall next to Bedok camp), this unassuming bistro serves up some surprisingly sophisticated food at neighborhood prices. Way better than overpriced cafe food / poached eggs thingeys. Underground parking at the mall or open air carpark across the road. Open for dinner too. 
The cod possessed a Jekyll &amp; Hyde complex, with one piece being buttery soft and the other being firmer and significantly chewier. Elsewhere, the dehydrated enoki were romantically wispy ghosts of their former bubbly selves and whoever created the scallion foam must have murdered and used sixty bajillion scallions in the process. 3.7/5
The firm, chewy pasta wore a titillating lobster bisque-esque fragrance, a scent so aggressive in its entrapment desires that you sense its presence whilst the pasta is metres away en route to you. Elsewhere, the octopus leg and squid were deliciously smoky and roasty, and the sea urchin roe played like a very relaxed mussel. 4.1/5
Mum hates the hassle so we celebrated her birthday here because there‚Äôs good food at relatively affordable prices, impeccable service and it‚Äôs cosy! So yes yes, back again. 
Newly added to their choice of appetisers, this was really worth adding additional $5 for. The herb butter was delis and great for dipping the toast. The snails were pretty good and didn\'t have a bad aftertaste like some other places. Even my little man ordered it along with a smoked salmon club sandwich as his main. Go check out @sanbistrosg new lunch menu! So worth the moolah #burpple #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljns #lomljnck
