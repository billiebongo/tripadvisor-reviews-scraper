I ordered the spicy tendon set which comes with a small bowl of udon. Trust me its not spicy at all for S\'pore standard unless you belong to the group who don\'t touch spicy food at all. However the sauce is way too salty and i can\'t balance off the saltiness as the tempura were drenched with the sauce and some part of the rice also had the sauce. The best tempura is the chicken breast as all other reviewers commented; it was very tender and juicy despite it being fried. The rest were normal. I still prefer Tendon Ginza Itsuki at tanjong pagar though one smell like the fying oil after but the tempura and the onsen egg tasted so fresh and awesome! Its just worth smelling like the frying oil.
2 pieces of tender chicken, 2 king prawns, and a whole assortment of colourful vegetables to balance out the diet...
Had the signature tendon with multi grain rice! Portion was big, worth it for the price. Q for probably around 10 mins before is our turn! The sauce was quite flavourful and the fried items were quite alot. Kind of jelak to my bf towards the end. The spicy flavour one have kick, those who really cant tolerate spicy food pls do not attempt to try hahaha!
Super filling and super good ! Definitely coming here again for another bowl of this heaven
The batter is a little too thick and one of my chicken is so tough I couldn\'t even bite it. The veg tempura and the squid tempura are not bad. Sadly, too oily for me, can actually taste the oil. IMO Ginza is much worth it, second to all the reviews I read.
A total of 10 tempura items, in 8 unique varieties, served over fluffy Nanatsuboshi white rice.
Everything is beautifully deep fried to a crisp and then drenched with a special tendon sauce that\'s savoury and sweet. They use Nanatsuboshi rice from Hokkaido which is really fragrant and fluffy. There\'s nothing I don‚Äôt like in this bowl. Chicken breast is tender and juicy even though it\'s quite thick. Prawns are fresh and crunchy. The squid needs no effort to chew. All the vegetables are equally delicious. All in all, this tendon isn\'t overly greasy or cloying because the frying oil they use is always fresh-tasting and the tempura doesn‚Äôt ooze oil when bitten into. I\'m happily sprinkling chilli flakes all over my bowl. Can\'t wait to dig in! üòã
Huge servings of chicken, scallops, ebi and assorted vegetables. Definitely makes a good meal when you\'re famished. It\'s difficult not compare this to Ginza Tendon, and I think Ginza is a close winner as they\'re tad bid more exquisite. The chicken here is chunkier.
Don\'t really understand what\'s the craze about. I guess the presentation was pretty cool but the bowl definitely didnt taste as cool as it looked:/ The batter was so thick that it felt off the ingredients inside when picked up. The drizzling of sauce also lacked consistency because my rice was so dry without any sauce while my boyf\'s soaked through:( (though I know that I could add the sauce myself but still..üò®) The ingredients lacked seasoning as well:/ We weren\'t the only ones disturbed by the food. The patrons sharing the same table of 6 as us were upset about it too when complaints could be heard with every bite? Very disappointing as we had been looking forward to trying it for some time.\n<br />Definitely not gonna recommend to anyone. Tendon Ginza Ituski is still the best in my honest opinion:)
Thank you bff @fangningkoh for bringing me there! I am NOT a fan of tempura but this is really not bad. Quite different from normal tempura I have and they are very generous w the amount of tempura in a bowl.\n<br />However the q was pretty insane. We sat down in the restaurant after queueing for about an hour, little did we know that food preparation is another 20mins. Whut?!?! üò° They did explain that due to maintaining their food standards, they can only prepare 6 bowls at a time. I totally understand, but if thats the case, they should have informed their customer earlier so at least I know if I can wait right? ‚òπÔ∏è\n<br />It\'s definitely worth a shot but not the wait unless you have plenty of time to kill. If not, visit them during non peak hours (not lunch/dinner time), you might then be able to skip the q. .\n<br />#burpple #eatoutsg #nomsterofficial #singaporeinsiders #throwbackphoto #kohakutendon #japanesefood
17:50 hrs on a Saturday - an hour long wait in line. Best to reward yourself with a bottle of ice cold beer. ‚ùÑ üçª (Love how the glass is cold as well because ain\'t nobody got time fo\' warm beer)
Crisp, not oily and very fresh. The down side was that my rice was drowning in sauce, even after I was done eating there was a pool of sauce leftover at the bottom of the bowl.\n<br />-\n<br />I was pleasantly surprised to find a piece of fried sotong!

Holding such such high expectations for this spot...I was really surprised to find that I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I hoped to üòß Popped by on an off-peak hour, and had to wait 30min for my bowl (there were 4 bowls ahead of us) which came with the tempura already entirely soggy and not holding a single bit of crisp crumb. Of course having sauce drizzled over it means it won\'t be mad crispy; but if it wasn\'t left out to sit and instead had sauce drizzled over right before it was served, shouldn\'t there be at least some crunch? Points to the tempura batter not being greasy at all, but it was so thick I could peel it all off as a single piece. Portion\'s generous and ingredients are well cooked so I understand why people enjoy this, though unfortunately I guess I\'m just not one of them ü§î

The meal here is really worth it cause it\'s only $15 for the bowl tempura Tendon! The bowl consists of  prawns, chicken tendons, mushroom, tapioca, squid and crabstick! They come in the spicy and non-stick versions so I would really recommend this restaurant! There is also the ice green tea which costs $2 and it is refillable! Super worth trying.
For $15, you get 2 pieces of prawns, 2 pieces of chicken, and a whole bunch of other ingredients. Man was i satisfied. Fluffy batter with a nice savoury yet sweet sauce drizzled on top. One thing i would say is that maybe it was still slightly oily. But nonetheless a really satisfying bowl of sinful fried goodness. 8/10

As you can see, picture says a thousand words. Huge portion with 2 chickens, 2 prawns tempura, a crabmeat, and veges! Don\'t you think it is a steal to get them all in a bowl at $15? Oh and i\'ve got to remove the meat on one side to tuck into my rice... definitely i will be back for moreeee!
Located in Tower 1 (where Pasarella is), on the 3rd floor opposite the True Fitness gym. I always dislike going to Suntec City cos I keep getting lost. But just look for the snaking queue (there already was one at 6:15PM) in the Eat At 7 cluster.
One of the more successful entrants in the recent Tendon boom. At peak hour, you will need to wait at least 30mins. The basic mixed Tendon bowl is $15. Lots of ingredients in this one bowl. There\'s prawns, chicken, asparagus, baby corn, squid and mushrooms. The tempura items were well fried but the sauce was a tad too sweet. Overall, a decent bowl of Tendon.
i went to this restaurant on dayy 2 of cny.. as there is no one in the queue so it is straight entryy for me.. this is byy far the best tendon i ever tasted.. whyy? the tempura is not too greasyy and it is not overfried.. done at just the right texture good for consumption.. i was given the sauce to drip onto myy rice anyy amount i want.. but i didnt add too much though cos i dont want the flavour of the tempura sauce to overpower the flavour of the tempura ingredients.. veryy nice presentation as well.. i will highlyy recommend this to myy friends who love tempura.. take note of the high queue volume though.. the waitingg time can be veryy longg..
A fulfilling meal, I\'d not queue an hour for this.. and I did not.. but still overall it was pretty alright. Still waiting for the chance to head over to Ginza for the comparisonüôÉ
Fried in front of our faces! üç§üç§üç§ Really surprised by how tender and flavorful the chicken pieces were. And really surprised by how Japanese cuisine can still surprise me despite the assurance in their standards for quality and taste.
Yes please! Coming with fresh seafood, tender chicken and mixed vegetables, the Kohaku tendon ($15) was delicious. The only downside was that we waited for 30 mins in line and 30 mins for our food to come. üò≠
Okay wait time during weekday lunch time, Crispy yet deliciously juicy. Great tempura fix :) very pleased
AWESOME FOOD! @kohakutempura Just go and try it at least once. For this price, no complaints üòç There were 2 prawns, 2 pieces of chicken (sometimes it\'s 1 big slab instead), squid, french beans, corn, pumpkin, mushroom, crab stick.
I became a fan of the tendon ever since I first went to Japan. So i got overly zealous when i heard raving reviews about this place. Had to queue for about 30 mins during a weekend dinner hour. Do come earlier if you want to avoid the queue. There\'s a set meal available that comes with udon. But in my opinion, the tendon itself is enough to bloat your happy belly. The tempura is as impressive as it looks. Contains assorted veg, prawns and chicken fillet. Batter is crispy and not nua on the inside. The rice glisten like the mother of pearl rice. Not clumpy and the special tendon sweet sauce goes really well with it. The only ingredient missing here is the fried onsen egg which i deeply missed back in Japan. Personally i will root for this over Ginza Tendon. \n<br />Êó•ÂºèÁîú‰∏çËæ£È£ØÊÄéÈ∫ºËÉΩÂ∞ë‰∫ÜKohaku!

Tendon Kohaku serves up crispy fried tempuras served on top of fragrant Hokkaido rice and drizzled with speciality sauce. There are about 7 pieces of tempura in the Kohaku Tendon which is really filling. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
Queued over an hour for this on a Friday night, been seeing this style of tempura on social media. Seating was sparse and food took a little while hence the wait. Some items in the bowl was better than others, enjoyed the long bean (surprisingly), squid, and the prawn. One criticism was probably not enough rice for the amount of toppings. All in all, not bad, not super worth the queue but a pretty good hearty meal.
It was good, filing and quite affordable, but with the 1.5hr q, i wouldn\'t have it again. I\'d got the the Tanjong Pagar one where the q is more than half and there\'s a chawamushi with my rice bowl and also free flow tea.
The wait is like never ending. The food is like never ending. #stomachburst .\n<br />.\n<br />Kohaku tendon ($15++). The first bite is heavenly and the Hokkaido rice drizzled with appropriate amounts of sweet sauce was awesome. But kinda too sweet and  overdose of fried food for me. Very huge bowl for me and I struggled to finish. Don\'t judge. Maybe today my stomach was not in good form. Be prepared to wait forever (2hrs on Friday night).
It was really yummy and the portion is huge. Would prefer the Spicy Flavour Tendon to the Signature Kohaku Tendon.
Be early, that\'s my suggestion. The crowd continues to line up even after 8.30pm and I can understand why. Their signature dish, Kohaku Tendon, comes with around 10 pieces of freshly prepared Tempura (vegetables, chicken, prawns and other seafood) and the tempura batter is so good! The batter isn\'t oily and you really won\'t need to add extra sauce as it will have its unique sauce already poured over. GF ordered the spicy version and the only difference I could tell is that the batter has a sharp spicy taste in it. The rice below the mountain of tempura is also soft and fragrant and it compliments well with the spilled tempura sauce.
I don\'t usually queue more than 5mins for food but for this, I knew to queue is inevitable if not l\'ll never get to eat it!\n<br />Totally worth it!\n<br />Though a tad too much gravy that made it too salty for me but all the ingredients were super yummmz: 2 prawns, grilled chicken breast (tender!), cuttlefish, long beans, crab stick (not those we find in YTF stalls) mushroom, and babyüåΩ.
Arrived at 1130 on a Saturday. We\'d managed to get in after 15 mins, and waited for another 30 mins because each tendon (short for tempura don) is freshly fried upon order. So come early or risk getting hangry.
Ordered both the spicy and non spicy. Personally prefer the non spicy, the spicy is abit too much for me. Portion is huge. The tempura is nicely done. Yums!
generous serving portion. \n<br />ordered the signature bowl (non-spicy), which comes with pumpkin, mushrooms, long beans, chicken breast, crab stick, squid, baby corn and ebi prawns on top of japanese white rice. super worth it for the price tag and of course the calories involved üòÇ. I can see/understand why it\'s constantly long queue coz I would definitely queue for it again.
$15 for a bowl of Hokkaido rice top with prawns, chicken, squid, crabstick, mushroom, pumpkim, french beans and baby corn is very affordable &amp; valuable. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce (spicy) make the don very flavourful. The yuzu raddish side dish was refreshing. \n<br />A small eatery close to what commonly found in Japan. Small and cosy where diners come mainly for the food. So if you looking for a place to socialise with your friends please look some where else so more people can enter and enjoy the food.
2 French Beans, Baby Corn, Crab Stick, Shitake Mushroom, Pumpkin, Chicken, Squid &amp; 2 Prawns „Äã$15
Freshly prepared, it takes about 10mins waiting time for this heavenly bowl of golden tempura. The light sauce up that crispy batter to another level. Selection between normal or spicy bowl, both are good. The spicy bowl comes with a sharp kick at the end which was said to whet palates.\n<br />.\n<br />Especially good to have over a table full of laughters and casual talks on a relaxing day!\n<br />.\n<br />#kohakutendon #tendon #tempura
Prawns, squid, mushroom, chicken, pumpkin.. the kind of tendon you wna hv to kill any fried food craving you gt (and gna hv) üê∑üê∑üê∑ strongly recommend the spicy one for that extra kick!
There was still a queue even at 3:15pm! .\n<br />It was a hearty bowl of 3 jumbo prawns, 2 long beans, 1 squid, 1 crab stick, 1 mushroom, 1 baby corn and 1 pumpkin (requested for no chicken). The batter was something unusual from the ones I had before, thinner, crispier and none of that chewy white under-layer often a result of unskillful frying/ poor batter. Super love the prawns which were succulent and crunchy, a sign of freshness. Layered beneath was plump and fluffy imported Hokkaido rice grains soaked with some of the sweet/spicy sauce. Help yourself to the pickled radish on the table too as it really cleansed the appetite after a whole bowl of fried-ness-goodies üç§.\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, the service was just so so terrible üò™.
I found the tempura slightly soggy, not sure because of the batter or being drenched in the spicy sauce, but the spicy sauce is super addictive with its pretty strong kick. My favourite would be the squid and baby corn but I was quite impressed with the tender chicken breast too. Oh and I guess it would be better if they halved the long bean because it almost dropped when it was served before me (and also the fibre was not chewable at all). It was a tight competition with tendon ginza itsuki but I\'d say go for the latter for better tempura and the first for a more adventurous ten don.
I like to eat tempura and I have to try this recently opened store. Ordered the original Kohaku tendon($15). I find the sauce of the rice a little too salty for my liking. The vegetable, prawn and sotong tempura is fine. However, the chicken tempura is a little hard. Overall, I give it a 3/5 rating. If you come during peak hours there is gonna be a queue for now so be prepared to wait.
Kohaku Tendon- $15, Iced Green Tea- $2 (refillable)\n<br />Expect to queue for more than an hour during dinner time to be seated and another 15mins for the food. \n<br />I find the green tea like any regular green tea outside except + the ice. The tendon includes octopus, 2x prawns, vegs and chicken. Prefers Keisuke\'s chicken which is more tender. Sauce is on the salty side. Would prefer if they have a spoon to for us to use. Eating in Kohaku, you won\'t go out smelling like fried battered meat as bad as eating in Keisuke\'s.
Definitely value for money as there\'s a lot of ingredients! 2 tempura prawns, 1 huge piece of squid, 1 generous slice of chicken and lots of vegetables. It\'s great and definitely worth a try, but I will not queue for an hour for this. Next time, I will ask for the sauce to be served by the side so that the tempura will remain nice and crispy. On a side note, their green tea is very good. üòä
Braved the queue, rewarded with a pretty delish bowl of Kohaku Tendon($15). Quite a generous portion of seafood, chicken and vegetables fried till golden without greasiness but our only gripe was that it wasn\'t crisp enough. Even so, it was quite an enjoyable dinner with two plump succulent prawns, squid, crab stick, tender chicken (that was bland on its own but the tasty batter made it all better), long bean/ mushroom/ pumpkin/ baby corn that left me quite satiated. All served on a bed of fluffy Japanese rice, topped with savoury/sweet sauce (more on the sweeter side) - go for the spicy one for a little kick (was bearable by my standards so it\'s probably not thaaaat spicy). It\'s worth coming back.. If the queue isn\'t crazy. 
Tendon seems to be all the rage recently, and the queue at Kohaku was insane. I joined the queue at around 8pm but still had to wait for an hour üò≠ At least the tendon I had was quite yummy! It\'s topped with a mountain of tempura (battered prawns, chicken, asparagus, mushroom and pumpkin) - what a great deal for $15! The sauce drizzled on the tempura is stickier and sweeter than the dipping sauce we usually see. If you can\'t get enough of fried food, you\'ll be very happy with this tendon! For me though, it got a little heavy after 3-4 pieces so I would have preferred to share this. I got myself some green tea which is free flow and that helped too.
Queued for an hour even though we arrived before it opened. Verdict? Definitly worth it. $15 for this bowl of goodness is definitely reasonable. 2 prawns, 1 long bean, 1 mushroom, 1 (slice of) pumpkin, 1 piece of chicken breast tempura well dressed with their sweet-salty sauce. I\'ll be back (when I\'m back from taiwan) surely.
This $15 bowl of goodness.. Just go join the Q and try it! 
Spicy Tendon is the bowl to go for at this stall. Everything in here is yum and crisp. Food portion so generous, you leave the store burping and satisfied.\n<br />- \n<br />While I love the value-for-money Tendon at GTI, but I\'m üòû at the need to smell like Tempura (or febreze) after dining there. Loving that I don\'t smell like what I ate at TK!
How long would you wait for a good bowl of topped rice? An hour? More? We waited thirty minutes on a Tuesday lunchtime in the queue that snaked outside this tendon specialist and another twenty minutes to be served. The reason for the almost holy devotion is clear once your tendon (tempura on rice) arrives. It‚Äôs tempura perfection: light batter, golden and crisp, encases precisely and perfectly cooked seafood and vegetables. Two jumbo shrimps, sliced squid, crab stick, pumpkin, mushroom, baby corn, long bean and a remarkably large chicken, all dressed with a specially made sauce just before serving. The rice is also perfectly textured and delicately aromatic. In all, it\'s a mound so huge you‚Äôll be grateful for the appetite you built up waiting. The standard-sized portion costs $15; only ask for the set that comes with an additional bowl of udon if you‚Äôre really hungry. 
Lots of ingredients from prawns to mushroom to sweet corn, each bowl is freshly prepared as per order. This Kohaku Tendon was really satisfying, not too greasy and definitely very filling!! üòãüòò\n<br />-\n<br />P.S.: We queued for almost an hour before getting a seat! Well worth an hour wait!!
One of the best Tendon in town. A generous portion of tempura (chicken breast, prawns, squid, fish, mushroom, baby corn and long beans; quite a mouthful eh?) on a bed of fluffy Hokkaido rice. Went for the spicy version which I loved :) Come early to beat the queue as we left at about 6pm and there was already quite a long one, maybe due to the small space.
I\'m a big fan of ten-don but this just doesn\'t do it for me. Ingredients are fresh &amp; generous in size but the sauce is too sweet for me.
Lots of ingredients from prawns to chicken to mushroom to sweet corn, each bowl is freshly prepared on order. It was really satisfying, not too greasy and definitely very filling! Recommended to come after 1pm on a weekday :)
Portion is huge for $15 don. The most impressive is the squid tempura! Service could be better üòâ might come back if don\'t need to queue üòÇ
Had dinner here the other day, needed to queue a little before getting a seat. This is their signature tempura tendon and was really worth it for just $15. Generous serving with shrimps, pumpkin, chicken fillet, long beans, baby corn and squid. The chicken was surprisingly juicy and tender. Deep Fried in a good proportion of batter and held together with tempura sauce and lovely Japanese rice :) the sauce is a 10/10 for me, IM DEFINITELY GOING BACK!!
Tastes slightly better than Ginza Tendon, especially the chicken imho. Pricing similar too and you can queue in air-conditioned comfort.
this huge bowl made me happy and tired cause there\'s so much to chew yet i need to slowly appreciate it lololol! the batter and rice were all so good. #ievenreallylovedtheveg #whatttt #tempurakohaku
Kohaku Bowl (normal/spicy - $15) very large generous serving of 2 prawns, 1 piece of long beans, squid, mushroom, chicken, crab stick and my favourite baby corn! Really tough to decide which is better (as compared to Ginza Tendon) but love this for its flavourful batter with a light crisp and many many brownie points for their baby corn üòª
Super value for money Kohaku Tendon w a generous amount of vegetables, chicken and seafood tempura! The rice serving is smaller but I still couldn\'t finish it üòÖ The spicy version has a slight kick that was quite good! #Burpple #burpplesg #japanesefood #tempura #fridate
This bowl of Tendon goodness is loaded with 8 different tempura options, from vegetables to meat and seafood. Affordably price at $15, you can choose between spicy or the original special sauce.
Spicy kohaku tendon ($15) a bowl filled with a generous amount of different kinds of tempura -- prawns, chicken fillet, squid, crabstick, corn, mushroom, long beans and pumpkin!

Personally preferred the spicy version as it really give a kick in the sweet &amp; salty soy flavour. There are two types of pickles served free flow - yuzu radish &amp; ginger cabbage. The tempura squid &amp; pumpkin would be my fav among all. (too bad it doesn\'t have tempura egg in it)\n<br />I came early at fri 6 pm, waited ard for 10min. But when i left, the queue was a craze! It goes along &amp; up to Sumiya. üò≤üò≤üò≤ ‚ñ™\n<br />P.S. Not advisable to order the set as it comes with  only an half bowl of udon with an additional $4.50.

It was lighted battered and not oily at all.The squid core was chewy and easy to bite. Not forgetting the nature\'s sweetness of the pumpkin. All except for the chicken.

Piled high with assorted tempura - sweet¬†pumpkin (my favourite), crunchy French beans, mushroom, chicken, squid, crab stick, baby corn, and shrimps; Kohaku‚Äôs tendon is pretty¬†substantial.
Omg where do we even begin with?! use the mini bowl to place your tempura to reach lower for the rice and also use the sauce on the side if it\'s not enough ! Also download the @sunteccity rewards app for some discount !
Although I was initially a little skeptical as to whether the newly-opened Tempura Kohaku could live up to Ginza (no tempura egg!), this turned out to be surprisingly good! The tempura is freshly fried, with a thin, crisp batter. Ingredients were fresh and portion was quite substantial. The spicy sauce was a nice addition, providing a nice kick to the sweet sauce and the dish overall. The queue is still terribly long, so those who are on the fence may want to wait till the hype dies down. 
Good bowl of tempura don! Plenty of ingredients including vegetables, chicken, prawns and squid. My favourites were the juicy mushroom and the fresh, crunchy prawns. The small beady Hokkaido rice was nicely cooked and also very filling! Love the mellow spiciness of the sauce which made the meal less one dimensional. You can help yourself to some ginger cabbage with yuzu zest that helps to cleanse the palate. 
Price:$15. Might be back again! This new tempura outlet at suntec is rival of the established ginza brand in tanjong pagar. On its own, this tempura Don is absolutely value for money. You get a wide selection -- chicken, prawn, squid, corn and a few others. And it was well fried and the sauce was ok great. Nothing much I can fault. Especially at an economical price of $15. However, it pales a little in comparison to the ginza one which is marginally cheaper. Unlike the ginza one, this kohaku tempura Don doesn\'t come with the tempura egg (which is a serious plus point IMO), the chawamushi and miso soup. Taste wise, both are comparable, though it might ultimately boil down to preference. The tempura for this shop is more \'sauce-drenched\' whereas the one in ginza is more fried. Though of course I\'m quite sure that this can be varied if u were to specially request otherwise. 
Hitting the early lunch crowd, our half hour wait was made worthwhile once our bowls of tendon were placed in front of us. A gorgeous combination of assorted tempura piled atop a steaming bed of rice, it is no wonder that the place is filled by office workers that are willing to sacrifice their nice smelling clothes.¬†
It was love at first bite with the two juicy prawns, chicken, mushroom, crabstick, long bean and baby corn all coated with crispy tempura batter and drizzled with their tendon sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />Chomped down the whole bowl of goodness and yet not feeling greasy from the fried food. Also for sauce eaters like me, I am glad to find the sauce readily available on the table for my unlimited dispense. üôå\n<br />.\n<br />More spacious, better ventilation and less smelly like tempura compared to the other famous tendon at Tanjong Pagar, I foresee myself coming back for a second serving very soon!
The sweet, saucy tendon clubs you in manner of vicious seal-hunting Canadians with a smorgasbord of various tempura (chicken, squid, vegetables and prawns etc) so plentiful that you would be left guilty and phat, while elsewhere the powdery spice teases your lips and inner mouth lining with a tailfeather. 3.5/5
The tendon bowl is loaded with prawns, chicken, squid, vegetables.. Again, this tendons are very generous with their potion. Taste overall is good. All the ingredients taste quite good to me but nothing really stands out other than its hot when serve.. Tempura flour tend to get soggy after a while but by no means, it affects the experience.. I think if I were to compare, they are good but probably still need a few tweaks to alleviate their dish. \n<br />8/10 üëçüèΩ *do try the spicy version for added kick and to get a different perspective!
Love Japanese food? How about this? I had the spicy flavor one. Its good! üòÑüòã
If you\'re a fan of tendon, a straightforward Japanese dish of tempura on a bowl of rice, here\'s another restaurant to satisfy your craving! Located within Eat@Seven in Suntec City, Tempura Kohaku is a great spot for an intimate catch up over delicious Japanese food, at least until the crowd finds out about this place. The menu is concise, with only four tendon options. The Kohaku Tendon ($15) that comes with prawns, chicken and vegetable tempura is a safe order, but if you like your spice, you must have the Kohaku Tendon Spicy Flavour ($15). It is essentially the same bowl, but with an unbelievably tasty, mildly burning spicy sauce drizzled on. While there is no oozy, fried onsen egg like the tendon at Ginza Tendon Itsuki, the crisp, light-as-air batter and spicy sauce certainly sets itself apart! For ravenous eaters, there\'s a Tendon Set (from $18.50) that comes with a bowl of udon on the side and preserved vegetables.\n<br />Avg price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Gavin Chan
Nice Spicy Tempura don! Best thing compared to Ginza is this place comes without a queue! Quick fix for a Tempura crave! A Tempura don + green tea adds up to $20.
üòç Have not tried the much-raved Tendon Ginza Itsuki, so I can\'t make a comparison, but this glistening bowl of tendon sure was generous for the price paid - fresh, yummy shrimps, squid and vegetables, topped with spicy sauce üå∂üå∂. Happy campers we were! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
|\n<br />First post I saw today on my Facebook was regarding this stall. Somehow the image of the bowl of tendon got stuck in my head and kept thinking about it from breakfast till lunch time. Finally I gave up into temptation and made my way here. .\n<br />|\n<br />Greeted by a very friendly service crew, I had the restaurant all by myself. .\n<br />|\n<br />For a full impact of this meal, I decided to follow their instructions and took out all the tempura. Sprinkled a little chilli powder and a few drops of tempura sauce on the rice. .\n<br />|\n<br />I must said that this bowl of Tempura was close to PREFECTION!!! Following will be the breakdown of this Don. .\n<br />|\n<br />üêô‚û°Ô∏è light bouncy texture and seasoned with salted water. üçÑ‚û°Ô∏è tasted like mushroom butter and super juicy. \n<br />Pumpkin ‚û°Ô∏è super thick but cooked through nicely. Good contrast with its sweetness and savory crust. üåΩ‚û°Ô∏è light sweet. Don\'t taste like from the ones from the can. \n<br />Long bean ‚û°Ô∏è it\'s fragrant smelled like fries (in a very good way). ü¶Ä‚û°Ô∏è not exactly from the real crab meat but it was the high class crab stick. üç§‚û°Ô∏è thick and juicy. So prawnyyyy. üêì‚û°Ô∏è one whole chicken fillet! Slightly overcooked (maybe next time I should eat this first rathe than keeping it the last). .\n<br />|\n<br />For the set, it came with udon. Very springy udon but the soup was rather salty. The funny thing was that they served the udon first than the tempura Don. Which the saltiness might numbed the taste bud. .\n<br />|\n<br />Newly opened at Suntec City, Seven at Work.
üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª $15 for crispy and delicious flavoured battered ingredients atop the fluffy and individually grained Japanese rice. Okay my description sucks but this is really very good stuff. Feedback to the staff that inclusion of egg would elevate the presentation and taste and sounds like they\'re gonna taking this suggestion seriously. üòâ Highly recommended! 
I love Ginza Tendon Itsuki‚Äôs super value for money tempura don set but I was really intrigued to try this especially after seeing the spicy version that Burppler Gavin posted. 
Chanced upon the opening day of the authentic shop specializing in tendon in Suntec.  It only has a couple of items on the menu.  The Kohaku tendon ($15) had chicken, 2 prawns, squid, premium crab stick, and Japanese veges.  Very very good value and a lot better IMHO than Tendon Itsuki.
Fried food craving satisfied~ üòçüòçüòç
They only have it till February 2018!
Among all the pieces, I liked the king crab meat and snow crab best ‚Äì both tasting sweet and juicy.
I‚Äôve heard so much great, wonderful review about how awesome is this bowl of Tendon so I decided to make a trip there to try it myself! I ordered their Signature Kohaku Tendon that comes with a bowl filled up fried Long beans, fried chicken (which taste so good and juicy!), Fried Prawn (Super big prawn and fresh!), fried mushroom (big and juicy), Fried Sotong (Super soft, tender and chewy), Fried corn (I‚Äôm not really a corn lover but this caught my taste bud!)! I was being offered a bar seat and perfect angle to see how the Chef prepare our food! The Chef who do the plating takes such pride in laying them neatly on the bowl! He doesn‚Äôt rush in the plating and makes sure that the food serve to us was all in place! Love their Japanese professional attitude! If you asked me if I would Q for it again, the answer is YES because it way tooo goood and I‚Äôm willing to Q for it all over again! @kohakutendon #tendonkohaku #tendonkohakusg #letsmoreenjoytendon #kohakutendon
totally understand the hype now, the tempura are so good and makes the wait so worthwhile! but only for the first 15 mins or so, before the jerlat and oily feel kicks in, made worse with the soggy skin. \n<br />dinner idea last night, presenting the original bowl and seasonal special of yuzu salmon and assorted mushrooms.
$15++ \n<br />Super yummy\n<br />No queue before 6pm

Comparing value, variety and quality, i daresay this is the best tendon i\'ve tried so far in sg. Ask for separate sauce if worried about sogginess.

If you\'re a fans of tendon / fried stuff, you shall give this a try. \n<br />I don\'t understand the menu, but my friend told me \"there\'s just 2 type - spicy &amp; non-spicy\". \n<br />I chose the non-spicy, but it tasted slightly spicy (not sure whether the staff had served it wrongly between my order &amp; my friend\'s order).\n<br />But, not a bad 1.\n<br />The bowl might look small, but it\'s super full for me when I finished it. It contained of üç§ , fish, chicken, long bean, sweet potato.

A bowl of tempura goodness - think prawns, chicken breast meat, mushroom, pumpkin, crabsticks. Among the best that i\'ve tasted locally, though still a tad oily compared to the ones in Japan.

Crispy tempura coated with a savoury (and spicy) sauce. Choose the multi grain rice for that extra springy texture in every bite. \n<br />Comes with 2 prawns, 2 chicken breasts that aren\'t that dry and tough to my surprise, long beans, pumpkin, baby corn, squid (that can be replaced) and crabstick.

üòã This and Ginza I mean.

Happy #Saturdate with the bf yesterday for #yummy #tendon on his only day off in between our respective trainings...! üôå
Got to try this scrumptious belly filling tendon from @kohakutendon  Love that I had full view of how they prepared the food, which was very clean and professional! The batter was flavourful, liked that the sauce was a little sweet which added more dimension to the taste. Generous portion consisting of tender chicken breast, fresh prawns, bouncy squid, long beans, corn, pumpkin, mushrooms over a bed of 16 mix rice.\n<br />#jayellesays #nom #nomsterofficial #instafoodie #instafood #burpplesg #burpple #tendon #delish #fatdieme #tempura #ricebowl
I had the spicy tendon set. It came with a very normal udon and the star aka Spicy sauce Tendon. I read a review of a food blogger saying the sauce is spicy even for S\'pore standard which is so not true though i would say the sauce is too salty. Surprisingly the chicken breast is still very tender and juicy even after all the frying. The rest of the items like the prawns, pumpkin, mushroom, long beans are pretty expected. Waited for about 30mins as the eatery has only a few seats. I still prefer Tendon Ginza Itsuki even though it has bad ventilation, their tempura taste \"fresher\" and it has that onsen egg- a big plus!
Queued for more than one and a half hour. The portion was really big. I was expecting to get sick of eating too much tempura. But the tempura was really soft and nice!
The kohaku spicy tendon at suntec is pretty interesting and relatively tasty. I queued 1 hour for it which is probably due to the slightly dispassionate staff. I found the tendons to be fried well and patted dry of the oil before serving. The chilli definitely helps in making the meal much tastier. It also helps that the food is pretty affordable for restaurant food.
üòç Definitely worth the money.\n<br />-------------------------------------------------\n<br />#tendon #kohaku #tendonkohaku #tempura #don #japan #japanesefood #japanesefoodsg

Back to one of my fav places again @kohakutempura for cheap tempura rice bowls! There\'s only tempura and carbs here so nothing new. Please see earlier posting (7Jan) for in-depth review and prices.
The portions were quite good and I really love the fried green beans!! Prawns were okay but when it came to the tail end part it was cold? Love the chicken, how it was nice on the outside and really tender on the inside. My only disappointment was that the sauce made the tempura soggy and it affected the crispness of the whole tempura experience. Maybe on that day they were off form. Well would I go back? Yeah! Made my tummy full for 15 bucks on a busy day! #ahungrywessg #burpple #BurppleSGValueForMoney .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #singapore #sgfoodie #foodie #beautifulcuisines #foodforthought #lunchhour #lunchdinner #lunch #sgeats #vscofood #topcitybites #hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #visitsingapore #tempura #japan

It was so good. Every piece of tempura was fried without being too oily and there was this yuzu radish looking appetizer which helped to break the taste and heaviness of the meal. \n<br />Happy bday @jeanzc!

Slurp.
Was there for dinner just 2 hrs ago. Ordered their kohaku tendon after waiting for an hour or so in the queue. As the tempura ingredients were covering my rice, I took some of them out and put it on a separate dish. Half way through my meal, I notice there was a Mosquito under my chicken tempura and notified the server. It was fine that the server replaced a new set for me, or so I thought. By this time, I had already lost my appetite and requested it to be packed for takeaway instead. Upon reaching home and opening up the packet, to my horror, this was what I found, just the rice and the chicken and a measly pumpkin slice. I would have expected a new complete set as the rest of the tempura ingredients, that was taken out onto a separate dish earlier, could have been contaminated as well and upon the discovery of the Mosquito, I did not dare to continue eating it as well. I would not deny that the food was good and cheap but due to this incident, I will not go back ever again.
Finally got a chance to try this Kohaku Tendon ($15++). Available in spicy and non-spicy. Totally worth it but I wouldn\'t queue for 1 hour just for this. üòãüòãüòãüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº

Inevitably, comparison will have to be made against tendon ginza itzuki. I preferred tendon ginza itzuki because:\n<br />- the rice at kohaku is too wet\n<br />- uneven batter and burnt chicken at kohaku\n<br />- crab stick?!?!\n<br />- small prawns were given, which was coated by a thick layer of batter

The assortment of seafood and vegetables is fried till they are incredibly crispy and yet it is not dripping with oil as you savour it. \n<br />One can see the efforts of the chefs in the preparation of the food as they dip each of the items in the hot frying oil and wait for them to turn golden brown before serving. \n<br />Scrumptious and absolutely filling and not to forget to mention the slightly tart picked radish with yuzu that I cant stop indulging in \n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #burpplesg #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafe #japanesefood #sgfoodlover #vscosg #sgrestaurant #instagramsg #food #vscosingapore #igfoodies #foodgasm #foodiesg #foodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodlover #burpple #foodlovers #igfood #japanese #foodsg #tempura

Tempura Kohaku Â§©„Å∑„Çâ Áê•ÁèÄ One of the Best Tendon in Town? Why? The Batter is Light, Ingredients Fresh, Generous Toppings &amp; Good Value for Money üç§ .\n<br />Basically only 2 Types of Tendon are offered. The Signature Kohaku Tendon/Spicy Tendon (üíµS$15) or Vegetable Tendon (üíµS$14) I had the Former. üéè
Not forgetting the side of udon which looks like nothing much but was Kait\'s fave!
I was kinda reluctant (and still am) to visit the supposedly more popular one over at Tanjong Pagar due to the bad ventilation and I have heard many stories of people coming out from the restaurant smelling like tempura. Fortunately, I did not leave here smelling like I\'ve been deep fried and from what my dining companion commented, who have tried the Tanjong Pagar outlet previously, the batter used by Kohaku actually tasted better, just less crispier. To me, if there are minimal differences, I will gladly come back to Kohaku again as I will not leave smelling like oil.\n<br />.\n<br />Back to the food, at $15 for the Kohaku Tendon bowl which comes with a generous amount of tempura (prawns, mushrooms, chicken breast, baby corn, pumpkin, long beans and a squid piece) atop a bed of Japanese rice, this is definitely filling and value-for-money.\n<br />.\n<br />Kohaku Tempura\n<br />Address: 3, Temasek Boulevard, Eat At 7, Suntec City Mall, Unit 03-311, Singapore 038983 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #tendon #eatat7 #japanese #kohaku #tempura #sunteccity

Have it within a bowl of fluffy rice which makes it rather filling to have!
Suddenly everyone is posting photos of it on Insta. The postings tempted me so the wife says let me treat you lunch lah, come meet me for lunch.  Satisfied now.
All these mixed with  a bowl fluffy rice that comes with a spicy sauce that carries the overall flavour up by another level!
Everything in the bowl are worth it, worth the price, worth the portion!! 
Just make sure not to visit with freshly washed hair cause the stench is quite a nasty one
