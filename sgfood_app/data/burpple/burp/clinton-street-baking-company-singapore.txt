Banana &amp; walnuts Or Blueberries? I dont know, love em both \n<br />.\n<br />I might like this one better, just a tiny bit
This thing needs the recogniztion their pancakes got. So buttery (+dem Maple butter as well), fluffy, moist 4.25/5
Delicious pancakes for lunch! The pancakes were light &amp; fluffy, complimented by the blueberry sauce and the warm maple butter!
‚òÄÔ∏è just about the best #blueberry #pancakes in sg, look at how thick and fluffy the stack is! #burpple
Totally lives up to the hype. I\'m a convert when I laid eyes on this beauty. Best pancake I\'ve tried and it\'s not even close. Just come down to try it and believe it
The smooth peanut butter mousse had just enough subtle peanut butter flavour without being too cloying, while the chocolate layer was chocolatey without overpowering the peanut butter mousse. And that crumbly pie base. Sublime
Chicken and Waffles-waffles, was one of the best ones i had, the chicken, for an award winning, is a bit dissapointing. Sure it is juicy, but lacks flavor 4.25/5
Peanut Butter Ice Box Pie - It isd really creamy but not overpowering. You can taste the chocolate, hint of PB, pretty good. 4/5
Pancake-i get why the pancakes here are adored. They are one of the best ive had. The maple butter also sure is an elevated version of Maply Syrup 4.5/5
Super thick and fluffy!! Very legit. I appreciate how light and viscous the maple butter is, not those thick gooey kinda sauce. And the pancake batter was tasty on its own too!
Choice of swiss or cheddar cheese. With caramelised onions on toasted French Roll. Changed the hand cut fries to sweet potato fries! Somehow the patty felt rather under seasoned and not quite juicy. I would think that this is quite underwhelming compared to the other dishes we ordered. Added a corn muffin for $5. It\'s more on the savoury side, not like Kenny roger\'s (since everyone is familiar with that). Cold brew was pretty decent!
Sunny side up eggs with red beans, guacamole, jalape√±o sour cream, salsa picante, pepper Jack cheese, on a house made corn tortilla. Loved this!! So flavorful and everything works well together and separately! If I had one gripe, it\'ll be that I wish there were more tortilla!
Good for sharing. Comfortingly fluffy and thick, topped with crunchy walnuts, bananas and a side of delightful maple butter syrup that wasn\'t cloying. Pancakes cravings satisfied! 
Guacamole, Mexican beans, salsa picante and jalapeno sour cream are quintessential Mexican foods that work brilliantly together, combining into a creamy, cool yet spicy mess of umami deliciousness that\'s enriched with the breaking open of the sunny side up eggs. Such was the largesse on my plate that I didn\'t even realise a corn tortilla lay smothered beneath, ready to sop up the saucy co-mingling of ingredients above. It also makes sense to top up $4 for chorizo.
Finally gotten down to trying this after passing it over for the equally popular Katz Deli (pastrami sandwich yassss) located nearby in NY.
And you can already see how thick these are. We shared it among the four of us, which was definitely correct. LOL. Fruity sauces usually aren\'t my kind of thing, but since it\'s the ~signature~... Haha. They were still really great to me because the cakes were not just thick, they were full of wheaty eggy flavour, which made them stood out from the run-of-the-mill pancakes out there.
But it really blew me away. The food was that good. The chicken with waffles, blueberry pancakes and salted caramel milkshake all met my expectations after reading all the reviews on how awesome they were. Didn\'t get any over fried chicken mentioned by some too ^^ Service by the 2 young ladies were good, though the guy was kind of bossy...
‚òùÔ∏è (But to me this is basically heart attack on a plate hahaha üòÇ) Four big chunks of fried chicken served with honey tobasco sauce, slaw and jalapeno corn bread. Admittedly, the chicken was very tender, but I\'d have preferred for the corn bread to be without the infusion of jalapeno cos it tastes... weird üòÖ
Everyone is here for the pancakes and fried chicken &amp; waffles, and rightfully so. I was leaning towards a more savoury craving however, and this gladly fulfilled my love for Mexican flavours. Some sort of a deconstructed taco, with a corn tortilla filled with beans and cheeeese below the sunny side up eggs, and salsa, guac and sour cream surrounding around. Mix and match them and the dish will become a disgusting mush that\'s super delish, so I don\'t recommend sharing this. Share the pancakes (super fluffy, and honestly impossible to finish solo) and waffles (one of the best I tried) instead!
Blueberry Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter  ($19)
Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake ($10)
Love this fluffy pancake. Does get a bit too sweet after a while, so recommend to share 1 sweet dish and 1 savoury dish if you are going with a friend :)
Even though Clinton claims to have the best buttermilk fried chicken, this was too overly burnt. I would suggest to order the pancakes instead of this :/ the blueberry pancakes were really divine thou
This doesn\'t need another intro. I\'ll be back for the berry majestic dough!! I rate these pancakes 11/10 üòã‚ú® You\'ll prolly need to bring someone to share this with you as well! The maple syrup warms my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
The blueberry pancakes have always been my go-to. But today, TODAY, after what seemed like forever, I finally got around to eating the chocolate version. And boy were they good!\n<br />Besides the chunks of dark chocolate on top, the freshly-made pancakes were layered with the same chocolate in between. The heat from those fluffy beauties softened the chocolate pieces into a goopy thing that\'s ideal for spreading.\n<br />Out of habit, I had it with the iconic maple butter of Clinton St. Baking Company but my nephew resolutely stuck to having the pancakes on their own. He was adamant they\'re yummy as they are. I guess I can\'t argue with that.
A thick and fluffy stack of blueberry pancakes served with homemade warm apple butter. This stack of 3 can easily be split between two people, making the $18++ price tag a steal. 
Everything is made fresh in the morning, and they\'re well-sized like the other offerings at Clinton Street Baking Co. üç™üç™ There are classic sweets including this moist Blueberry Crumb Muffin, but if you\'re looking for something a little out of the ordinary, the savoury Bacon Spinach &amp; Cheese Muffin is a full breakfast in and of itself. #Burpple
Their pancakes definitely needs no more introduction (thick and fluffy!), this rendition is topped with chantilly cream, strawberries and vanilla crumb cake! Pretty similar to your usual strawberry shortcake but better when slathered with their signature maple butter sauce. Share the calories with a friend or two as it got really heavy near the end!
The waffles and pancakes were both light and fluffy, the chicken fried but still juicy and succulent, the spanish scramble had a generous serving of chorizo and Monterey cheese. The bananas in rum goes perfectly with the fluffy pancakes.. portions are large so four of us shared three mains and a side of sweet potatoe fries.. we were Super stuffed and satisfied #burpple
Finally got to try the famed Clinton St. Baking Company\'s pancakes! All I can say, if clouds were edible, these would be pretty good competition! üòã
Definitely a place for sharing! It\'s definitely too much of one thing to eat individually, but everything was delicious! Especially loved the Spanish omelette, very tasty but needed a bit more bread to eat with the egg and the generous ingredients (so. much. chorizo.). The pancakes was oh so fluffy but wasn\'t a big fan of the current flavour offered (coconut, bananas and pineapple). Will definitely be back but not something you can eat often.
Major thanks to Burpple for the Clinton St dining vouchers!! Absolutely enjoyed this stack of fluffy pancakes. The blueberry topping added a nice tang while the maple butter gave just the right amount of sweetness. We polished the plate clean! I shared this because the serving is huge, but the pancakes are so light I think I can finish them on my own! Or perhaps I was just hungry that afternoon because I saw a girl from another table only eat half of hers (what a wasteüò≠).
Both the blackberries and lemon curd weren\'t sour, instead tangy and not overly sweet too. Enjoyed this so much that I hope this can be on their permanent menu too!! üòãüòã
One more day to TGIF and the last day to enjoy Clinton Street Baking‚Äôs Blackberries &amp; Lemon Curd Pancakes ($21)! The first of the four flavours they are pushing out for the month, this fluffy creation studded with fresh blackberries wasn‚Äôt cloy at all though certainly filling. Warm, thick and soft, the stacks were the perfect texture - substantial yet airy. A whiff of buttery fragrance amped up with a touch of zing from the lemon curd just brought me to pancake heaven. Nicely balanced, the pool of blackberry syrup also provided a subtle sweetness that came through after the initial tartness and sourness. Definitely will be back to try the Strawberry Shortcake with Vanilla Crumb available on the last week!
Finally got to try the pancakes, black and white layer cake (not pictured) and of course, the chicken and waffle! Delicious food and good service. If anything, would have wanted a bit more crisp in the waffles :) portions are huge, so share the love! Promotion with mysamsung app ends 15th jan #BurppleXChope
_\n<br />Buttermilk fried chicken is flavourful although somewhat too dry. Pair them with their signature maple butter sauce instead - helps with the dry texture.  Waffles, on the other hand, tasted better with its fluffy texture and drizzled with the honey tobasco sauce.\n<br />_
Soft, fluffy pancakes drenched in maple butter - these pancakes are amazing. apart from hotcakes, these are the best pancakes in Singapore. but share them with a friend; this is really too much for one person.\n<br />#BurppleXChope
Clinton Street Baking Company hailing from NYC\'s Lower East Side was named \"#1 Breakfast Spot\" by Lonely Planet, \"Best Pancakes\" by New York Magazine. Therefore it\'s only appropriate for me to head down &amp; give it a try. üç¥\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter (üíµS$19) comes with a choice of Blueberries, Banana Walnut or Chocolate Chunks. \n<br />Definitely one of the Best Pancakes around, you are greeted with 3 Huge stacks of Blueberry-Studded stack of Fluffy ButterMilk Goodness. üòã\n<br />The small ramekin of warm Maple Butter hits all the right spots, worth every Penny. üçÅ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPSüíÆ: February is Pancake Month, therefore there\'ll be New Pancake Flavours coming out every week!! üèµ\n<br />1-7 Feb: Swedish Apple Pancakes\n<br />8-14 Feb: V-Day Chocolate Pancakes\n<br />15-21 Feb: Coconut &amp; Lime Pancakes \n<br />22-29 Feb: Crunchy Banana Pancakes \n<br />Made with Love &amp; Butter. üññüèª\n<br /> #BurppleXChope
Another Xmas special priced at $15. Comfort food, with the macaroni blanketed in ooey-gooey cheese. Thick chunks of lobster were also nestled within. They could have used more cheeses though, but overall not too bad.
4.5 munchies: Stacks of fluffy pancakes topped with light chantilly cream, smooth maple butter, and crunchy candied walnuts. The tartness of the caramelised Granny Smith apples was retained, balancing the sweet components of the dish. #Burpproved
Finally tried @clintonst_sg\'s highly praised pancakes (what have I been missing out all this time üôÄ) and it indeed is worth the hype!!! Incredibly thick and fluffy yet the best part is that it doesn\'t clump in your mouth like usual pancakes! Paired it with their signature Maple Butter and it sends you straight to pancake heaven! \n<br />Oh my, so eggcited about their pancakes I forgot to let you know that this is their Christmas version pancakes - Apple and Cinnamon ($19.90). Just their plain pancakes topped with caramelised Granny Smith apples and chantilly cream - simple yet oh so satisfying!! Guess this will make a super awesome Christmas brunch!! Book via Burpple to skip the queue! #BurppleXChope
The kind of sloppy I like in my life (along with saucy burgers and slurpy pastas). These pancakes could win an award for being the thickest and most fluffiest üê∞ It achieved the balance of having a light batter, without lacking in substance. The cinnamon apples and candied walnuts lent a touch of Christmas üéÑ just 6 more days, counting down!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple#cafe#cafehopping#brunch#dessert#pancakes
üòç\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />These delightful pre-meal treats boast of the fluffiest interior beneath the golden-crisp skin üòãüíï! Despite being rather plain tasting on its own, a generous spread of butter and raspberry jam did the trick to have us wanting seconds ‚ù§Ô∏è!
The Boston lobster chunks adds a little \"atas-ness\" to it. Comes in quite a small portion, best for sharing as an appetiser. \n<br />Though given usual Mac &amp; Cheese standards, this wasn\'t as jetlat - one should be able to finish easily by himself/herself.
I find this dish really simple yet comforting - the mix of sunny side-up eggs, asparagus, saut√©ed mushrooms, herb-roasted potatoes, thick bacon slices with that strong truffle vinaigrette. \n<br />This is a part of @clintonst_sg Christmas Special this December! Thank you @clintonst_sg for the warm hosting!
2.5 munchies: No doubt the Boston-imported lobster chunks were succulent and slightly chewy, but unfortunately, the mac and cheese had nothing to shout about. The elbow pasta could have been cooked more al dente; also found the bechamel sauce to be tasteless. Thankfully for the good balance of the milder, creamier flavour of the melted Monterey Jack and the more pungent-flavoured cheddar.
This short stack trio of buttermilk pancakes stole our hearts with its warm, pillowy interior that was simply irresistible! Loved the restraint on the sugar in both the chantilly cream and maple butter as well! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />On a side note, I still ain\'t pleased with the unapproachable service crew, except for the friendly restaurant manager!
A great starter for any dinner. Organic kale with quinoa, red onions, cherry tomatoes, avocado chunks and spiced pumpkin seeds tossed in lemon vinaigrette dressing. Add $3 for succulent grilled chicken, a fuller meal option.
This Christmas, I\'m happy stuffing myself silly with the Christmas menu from @clintonst_sg. \n<br />The hot favourite on the table was none other than the Apple &amp; Cinnamon Pancakes (no surprise here!) for the incredibly delish maple butter that perfectly marries the soft fluffy pancakes! And I (not so) secretly love the Kale &amp; Quinoa salad that comes with avocado, red onions, tomato and spice pumpkin seeds. \n<br />Many thanks Clinton Street for hosting, @munchingmarc for jioing and @yongweikai for the prettiest food styling.
Christmas specials from @clintonst_sg are launched today, 5th December!! Special dishes such as\n<br />- Truffle Fried Eggs ($23)\n<br />- Kale &amp; Quinoa Salad ($19\n<br />- Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese ($15)\n<br />- Apple &amp; Cinnamon Pancakes ($19)
Mark your calendar, guys! From tomorrow (5 Dec) onwards, Clinton Street Baking will be launching the following Christmas specials:
The Christmas edition is made of caramelized Granny Smith apples, chantilly cream, candied walnuts and maple butter. Cutting through the fluffy layers of the triple stacked pancakes and sending it into my mouth, it was love at first bite! Initially, I thought it might be too dense to have all three layers together but the pancakes were light enough to be enjoyed this way! The maple butter was also equally lovely and the sweetness is controlled by the caramelized Granny Smith apples. Those crunchy candied walnuts though small in size, were definitely important in shaping the dish!
These truffle fried eggs are made up of everything that I love ‚Äî herb-roasted potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, asparagus, arugula, bacon lardons all tossed in a truffle vinaigrette and topped with a lovely sunny side up egg. A whiff of truffle can be detected as the dish gets transported to our table, but not so much of that truffle taste on our taste buds. We have let the staff know during the tasting session and hopefully the amount of truffle will be tweaked! Otherwise, the ingredients are all wonderfully pieced together, especially with that fatty bacon!\n<br />This dish is available from now till 1st Jan 2017 (might be added to their menu if it\'s well-received!)
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />This Christmas season, the already legendary pancakes of Clinton St. Baking Company come decked out in festive flavours of fragrant cinnamon Granny Smith apple slices, vanilla chantilly cream, candied walnuts and their one-and-only maple butter.\n<br />\"Batter\" keep a lookout for its launch which will be happening very soon.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Don\'t mistake the exceedingly healthy ingredients of this Kale &amp; Quinoa Salad ($19++) to be a bore on the tastebuds because it packed an extraordinary amount of flavour.\n<br />A beautifully nuanced lemon vinaigrette dressing was responsible for lifting the frilly kale and quinoa to taste nirvana, while sunflower seeds gave each mouthful of the salad an enjoyable crunch.\n<br />To my delight as well, the grilled chicken breast (add-on: $3++) revealed its tenderness and just-right seasoning upon the first bite. \n<br />This new dish will be available soon in December as part of Clinton St. Baking Co.\'s festive menu.
‚Ä¢\n<br />That said, you\'ll probably be better off with something else instead; $21 bucks for 3 undersized pieces of chicken breast and an overly soft waffle just ain\'t worth the moolah, at least not for me üòó. #beingpractical\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Psst.. just in case Clinton might have missed this, THUMBSs up to the young waitress with a tiny ponytail &amp; the loveliest smile when we visited ytd! #needmorepeoplelikeyou üíù
Their warm maple butter is to die for!! Definitely not your normal maple syrup. Buttermilk chicken was superb, waffles was the soft fluffy type and not the normal hard crispy kind you get at ice cream shops. Pancakes are really fluffy and chewy and the maple butter makes everything tastes 10x better. Prices are on the high side though with the chicken and waffles at $21++ and pancake stack at $18++ but it is so worth the money. 
Fluffy chocolate pancakes with chocolate drops and sugary powder at @clintonst_sg are the best comfort food for long weeks. But #TGIF!
This was a true testament of the üéâüéâ Best pancakes in NYC by New York Magazine! üèÜüìúThe plate of triple stacked pancakes was simply the best among all other pancakes I ever munched on, no kidding üòå Never did I imagine a pancake without a scoop of ice cream could win me over; till I had this!! Ooh and wait till you drizzle that maple butter syrup, every bit to savour I dare say! The overall dining experience was very lovely indeed! A great ambience in a classy place with the most attentive &amp; courteous staff and serving up warm food as early as 9am on weekdays? Win Liao! üôåüèºüòÉüòÑüòÇlüôåüèº
This brings me back to the wonderful days of my grad trip in the US. Clinton has been named best pancakes in NYC twice and it\'s not hard to see why. The maple syrup is specially brought in to SG and its freaking legit! Thick stacks FTW.
The portion was huge, i could easily settle for only one of these, but after the first bite i knew i HAD to devour every crumb on the plate. The pancakes themselves are perfectly fluffy, and the warm maple sauce is such a delightful finish. I definitely recommend it.
Tried this once at Sin Lee foods and didn\'t liked it. Gave it another try here at Clinton and still felt that it\'s a weird combo.
Originated all the way from NYC, comes in three thick fluffy pancakes with the maple butter syrup that makes it even better!
And cooked bananas are also added within the pancakes. Paired with their unique  warm maple butter sauce, which tasted heavenly but probably very sinful, it was as  delicious as a pancake could be.\n<br />üç¥\n<br />But no matter how good, I found it impossible to finish 3 huge and thick pancakes alone. From an awesome first bite, the enjoyment slowly diminished until I had to leave half the portion untouched. And that\'s after I had passed some to my dining partner. So, don\'t be shy to order one to share!\n<br />üç¥
5 mins walk from Bugis Junction to this quiet cafe originated from NYC. Ordered the Pancakes w Warm Maple Butter ($18) and was pleasantly surprised by how huge the portion was! 3 stacks of warm, thick pancakes that were fragrant, rich but easy on the palate. Subtle taste of fried butter and just the right amount of blueberries in each pancake to taste the cake. Pancakes were good on their own without maple butter or wild blueberry sauce (best pancake topping is more pancakes!) 
3 fluffy and warm pancakes layered, with a side of maple syrup. The smell was truly mouth watering. 
Never sleep + never train + old age = personal worst timing :/ but at least the breakkie was good! Loved how the pancakes were fluffy with walnut bits and a tinge of banana flavour. The Country Breakfast was a good complement to the sweet pancakes dish.
|\n<br />The chicken was tender and salty which flavored the sweet waffle perfectly. If you are looking for good waffle with fried chicken, this is the place. .\n<br />|\n<br />Next time I am going to order more chicken.
So I finally went, and that is a lovely piece of chicken, even if the waffle is a wee bit too soft for me. But pillowyness is, after all, part of the American Dream, so...
Not as great as the buttermilk chicken or pancakes. Serving is smaller. Not worth $24.
With honey Tabasco sauce, a crispy Belgian vanilla buttermilk waffle, and their signature warm maple butte „Äã$21
While appearance at first may be lacking, the waffles are really good, soft and creamy which works well with the fragrant though abit dry chicken. The warm maple sauce sweetly compliment the dish, lifting it to an even greater level; though at 21$ it is a little steep.
These pancakes were so fluffy and soft! They were good! But a tad bit too much for baby and me. üòÅ @geekyelephant 1 pancake place down, 11 more to go!
Sweet sugar-cured bacon was probably the most favourite thing on my plate, even though it doesn\'t come anywhere near my favourite candied bacon at OMC. 2nd favourite was the sunny side up eggs with runny yolk. Well one runny yolk‚Äîthe other was overcooked. üòë\n<br />Apart from that, the cheese grits was pretty weird. Like some sort of fine rice and cheese mix. Looked like puke on the plate and maybe that thought just threw it off for me. It was kinda cheesy, kinda textured‚Äîbut not something I\'d go looking to order again. Polenta bars would\'ve been nice instead. The fried green tomatoes weren\'t to my liking either although I do love tomatoes and sourish pickled things, but maybe my dislike for crumbed and fried foods just put me off this combination.\n<br />The sweet potato fries aren\'t much to rave about either. To me they had a sourish taste and weren\'t crisp on the outside. I\'m now craving plump, crispy sweet potato fries from Shihlin Street Snacks. üôä\n<br />But all in all it was a good meal thanks to my company, who I\'m grateful for always making sure I eat properly, at least when we\'re dining together. üòò @christinelyh\n<br />#ClintonStBakingCompany #ClintonStSG #Brunch
Other than the jalape√±o corn bread that was not to my liking because of the strong spices, this 25$ plate is definitely worth the money!! The taste of the fried chicken is still lingering in my mouth and I\'m very amaze with the generous portion they serve as well!! Would definitely come again another time but this time I\'ll order the chicken and waffles instead :-)
Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich [S$13.50] &amp; Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter with Chocolate Chunk [S$18] at Clinton Street Baking Company, 31 Purvis Street, City Hall area.
Super generous with 4 chicken pieces! And the jalape√±os in the corn bread gives it a nice twist.
Finally got to try this in Singapore, all the way from New York City. I must say it is still really good and fluffy and thick, and generous serving that you can share. Thank God we don\'t have to fly there for this.
I never imagined this would happen but having been recently tweaked for a lighter and fluffier texture, the pancakes at Clinton St. Baking Company are even more scrumptious now! 
Clinton St. Omelette ($18) is really value for money. You have a choice of 2 fillings for your omelette and we had cheddar and bacon. Huge pieces of bacon and cheese in our omelette served with hash brown and sour dough toast. This hearty dish is a great choice for brunch! üòãüëçüèª
Heard so much raving about their pancakes and waffles! But because I was too hungry, my stomach made the decision to go for their Buttermilk Fried Chicken Plate ($25). üôä Sweet and tasty buttermilk chicken that melts in your mouth along with honey tabasco sauce, coleslaw and jalape√±o corn bread. A rather heavy and satisfying meal *burps üòã, will come back for their chicken waffles!
The waffle had a fluffy Holland Lop softness and the tenders-esque chicken, which was dusted with an appealingly salty powder, stripped with the fluidness and natural grace of a seasoned Geylang...(that\'s quite enough - Editor). 4/5
Not too shabby a meal and definitely feeds more than me. Don\'t know how people manage to finish these pancakes by themselves. Gluten-overload.\n<br />#ClintonStSG #ClintonStBakingCompany #Pancakes *
Light &amp; fluffy pancakes, my only complaint the fried banana was overly fried.
Grab your friends for a hearty American breakfast at this NYC-born restaurant. The Huevos Rancheros ($20) is a true flavour bomb, where cheery sunny side-ups smother a tortilla loaded with generous scoops of sour cream, tangy salsa, and creamy guacamole. Tip this over the edge with the addition of savoury Chorizo ($4)! A meal here demands that you order the unbelievably fluffy Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18), with Wild Blueberries as your choice of topping. These big portions scream to be shared, so order two dishes to share between three!
Cheese scone, chocolate scone + chocolate muffin. All heavenly. Best cheese scones I\'ve had. Moist and really cheesy.
First things first: I like Super Loco. But credit must be given where it\'s due, and the Huevos Rancheros at Clinton Street is sooo much better than the former\'s. 
Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18++)\n<br />Served with wild blueberries.\n<br />Available at @ClintonSt_SG \n<br />The pancake was fluffy and soft, with a kind of eggy taste. Some may felt that the blueberries was a bit too sour. Nice but could not take in more a piece of pancake. It was way too much for me.

As I was after something light today, I opted to have 3 items from the \"Sides\" section of the menu to form my breakfast. The large, round and thick piece of maple-cured ham steak was average but the eggs and spinach were fragrant from being cooked with a touch of butter. I could have, however, done without the uncomfortable presence of the tiny, hard and crunchy particles (sand probably?) in the latter. \n
It tasted so good when it\'s hot! As you bite it, there\'s this crisp on the outside. They make better butter syrup now. Best eaten this while it\'s hot! Don\'t talk so much or take too long to take a picture! Once it\'s on your table, just eat! You will regret it if you leave it there for 5 minutes!
Best brunch and authentic American breakfast I had in Singapore. Love the pancakes love the buttermilk biscuit sandwich
The enormously filling buttery, fluffy pancakes, which stored a steaming, 8.15am MRT train passenger-esque rage deep within, provided eggy French toast comfort whilst elsewhere the Bavarian cream was a sugary vanilla ice cream and whipped cream love child. 3.8/5
Been wanting to try their chicken &amp; waffle for a while - I left with a happy belly. The buttermilk chicken was tender, moist and flavourful. The waffle could have been a lil more crisp but it worked really well with the maple butter. Overall, happy belly! Will come back to sample their other offerings. 
It is then deep fried to achieve that thick crunchy coating on the outside. Topping off with their honey-Tabasco sauce for that extra flavour and their hand cut fries is oh-so-addictive! Served along with crunchy coleslaw that won\'t leave you feeling guilty after eating those fried chicken. Recommended for sharing.
This dish is a must for those who visit Clinton St. The waffles and fried chicken worked beautifully together, especially when dressed with the delightful maple butter (this syrup is too good!). You should also give the French toast, which is made with a buttery brioche, a go! 
that chicken waffle and big breakfast were pretty awesome. the eggs ben coming in a scone bottom was too dry for comfort though.
I\'ve tried Clinton St in Tokyo and immediately fell in love with the pancakes and was excited when it came to our shores! Soft, fluffy stack of pancakes with banana, walnut and warm maple butter in one bite, ... Hmm, what\'s there not to like? The humongous portion, maybe. Definitely one of the best pancakes around!
Crispy edge ard the circumference and so soft and fluffy in the middle üò≠ FYI: The portion is HUGE.
Hence I only finished half my chicken and waffles and packed the rest to go. The waffles are slightly deflated for my liking, but the chickens and the sauce is clear winner.
I\'ve heard so much about these pancakes (and that oh sooo glorious maple butter!!!‚ù§Ô∏è) and I\'m so glad that both didn\'t disappoint. 
Blue-berry pancakes! The maple butter syrup was amazing, possibly the best part of the dish. Pancakes were warm and fluffy but slightly too much for one person (so you shld share it!) 9/10üòã Best pancakes title still goes to the famed Pancakes on the Rock in Sydney!
Honestly I did not know about this establishment neither did I realize it\'s Southern American influence until I flip its menu. You would not miss its red canopy signature across the famous chin chin chicken rice coffee shop. As you enter, you will notice it\'s a clean and tidy deli serving up all day breakfast and american\'s favorite. Their egg Benedict is not the best by far, but it\'s uniqueness is that the eggs are served on buttermilk biscuits, with a slice of ham stack. The hollandaise sauce is a tat too watery and the eggs are missing the flavour. 
Fluffy eggs with chorizo that packs a punch, caramelised onions that melt in the mouth, and juicy tomatoes that balance the lavishness just subtly...terribly good. Give me good sourdough and I\'m happy, but give me perfectly crusty sourdough toast and I\'m ecstatic. Crisp-on-the-outside hash brown is such a treat especially when the mash within is a marriage of smooth and chunky. Ok, that\'s all.
It just overtook the Huervos Rancheros to become my favourite savoury dish here. Gonna be detailing it on my Burpple when I come off cloud nine.  #veronicaphuaeats #clintonstreetbakery #clintonstbakery #burpple #burger #sgcafe #cafesg #whati8today #instafoodsg #sgeats #eatoutsg #instafoodsg #BurppleTastemaker
I was completely smittened at first bite. For starters, the ratio of the different components in this burger was pretty much perfect in my opinion. Then there\'s that incredibly juicy, beautifully seasoned beef patty (done medium rare as per my request) with its intoxicating smoky-from-the-grill aroma. Texturally, I thought they had it down pat too--a little more refined than the hand-chopped macho coarseness of The Butcher\'s Club one--probably the result of the meat being freshly ground in-house daily. I picked the cheddar over the Swiss cheese as I preferred something salty to balance the sweet caramelised onions. Holding all of that plus some crisp iceberg lettuce together were two sturdy halves of a toasted French artisanal roll. It was assuring to know I could take big bites properly without stuff slipping and sliding all over the place. \n<br />The accompanying coleslaw was decent but it lost at the popularity stakes to the handcut fries, which was enthusiastically polished off with some help from my dining companions.\n
Blueberry pancake with maple butter was fantastic! It\'s warm, fluffy and has just the right amount of sweetness. The maple butter isn\'t greasy at all, with the pancake all perfect imo. Love the Eggs Benedict! Hollandaise sauce + biscuit = üëç only thing that disappointed me was the mocha, it\'s got a medicine taste
Was told they\'re famous for their pancakes and with a generous serving of three fluffy but nicely crusted pancakes and perfectly tangy blueberry compote to cut back all that sweetness (also coming from the heavenly maple butter), they deserve every bit of that fame.
Buttermilk biscuit sandwich comes with melted cheddar, house-made tomato jam with hash browns. While the scrambled eggs were thick and creamy, the star of the dish is the biscuit ‚Äì flaky, tender, and always melt-in-your-mouth good.¬†
Had a chance to try the much raved about pancakes. It was good, but not great üò∂
Love the savory and sweet combo of this. The fried chicken was üëçüèº but didn\'t like the thick waffles... Next time I will just order the fried chicken and have it with the pancakes instead. 
It comes with wild blueberries and maple butter syrup which is kinda sweet so don\'t drizzle too much while attempting the pour shot ‚òùÔ∏èüòÇ and if you\'re a small eater, rmb to share your pancakes cos they\'re really thickkkk! #clintonstreetbakingcompany
Blueberry Pancakes\n<br />topped with blueberries and served with maple butter sauce
Probably the most obscenely buttery-tasting scrambled eggs I have ever had. So depraved in silkiness I swear it\'s barely legal. Which is probably why just like Rihanna and her entourage, it comes surrounded on all sides by a gang of housemade rosemary sausage patties (these were slightly sweet and yummy), little blocks of cheddar cheese, herb-grilled tomatoes and toasted sourdough. 
Fluffily done eggs with more than enough pieces of smoked salmon folded in. Neatly balancing off the richness was a very lightly dressed salad. I wasn\'t too fond of the dark seven-grain bread (it\'s a little dense and heavy for my taste) but looking on the positive side, it does fill a belly very well if you\'re famished.
With chocolate chunks. My Favourite pancakes finally landed in Singapore wheeee! Definitely worth the wait :) 
The omelette was cooked to perfection and topped with swiss cheese, with sides of mashed potato and sourdough bread which was too hard to bite onto. My friend had the blueberry pancakes and that was the bomb though. Will definitely go back again.
My milkshake unfortunately did not bring any the boys to the yard‚Ä¶. However if you are looking for a deliciously rich and creamy treat for any occasion, this is it. I honestly do not want to know how much calories could possibly be in this one cup, it was so thick and filling on its own I almost (almost being the operative word) couldn\'t finish my mains after the first few sips so I suggest sharing. It was a little much for me but the taste and texture was good, I think fans of chocolate and peanut butter spread will love this!
The robust flavours found in the Huervos Rancheros are the sort that draws me like a Kardashian is drawn to fame. üòÜ\n<br />So I wasn\'t too surprised to learn that it\'s actually one of the bestsellers at the original Clinton St. Bakery Co. in New York. \n<br />#veronicaphuaeats #huevosrancheros #clintonstreetbakingcompanysg #clintonstreetbakingcompany #Burpple #mexicanfood #sgcafe #cafesg #whati8today #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #BurppleTastemaker
I\'m thinking about the to-die-for #breakfast smorgasbord from #ClintonStSingapore, and their OTT #milkshakes - go for the Boozy Salted Caramel ($15) made with bourbon. üòç
Meet my new favourite savoury dish here. Its robust flavours are exactly the sort that draws me like a Kardashian is drawn to fame. \n<br />Lying underneath it all is a housemade flour tortilla. Then everything else jumps on board for the mega mouth party. Bodyslamming each other are the Siamese twins of sunny-side-up eggs, a vivacious guacamole, charmingly smooth jalape√±o sour cream, don\'t-mess-with-me salsa picante, the mild but merry pepper jack cheese and saucy, slightly mushy red beans. I had to invite spicy Chorizo along because well, it\'s unthinkable for me to not meet some meat at this sort of orgiastic event! üòÅ\n<br />P.S. When I was settling my bill, I found out from the chef that the Huervos Rancheros is actually one of their bestsellers at the original Clinton St. Bakery Co. in New York. Honestly, based on that alone, I would have ordered this. \n
\nThe buttermilk fried chicken at trending Clinton Street Bakery has a thick-ish sort of hard, crunchy battered coating. It goes well with the classic maple syrup served separately (note: it\'s not the same as the unique one accompanying their pancakes). Apart from the complimentary coleslaw, you get to choose one side from their menu. I opted for the spinach and found it fragrant with butter which I really like.
I have read both good and bad reviews of the Brioche French Toast and both camps are rather passionate in their opinions. After trying it recently, I am standing with the ravers on this. Totally in love with how soft and fluffy those two thick slices of brioche are! They\'re dipped in an egg wash that\'s made fresh daily with some cinnamon and a sprinkle of sugar, then fried with clarified butter. The result is deeply aromatic and delicious. If you are ordering both this and the pancakes to share, I suggest eating the pancakes first because this packs more flavour per bite. Have it the other way around and the pancakes risk tasting bland in comparison. Incidentally, they both come with the same unique maple butter sauce that Clinton St. Baking Company is known for. 
The deliciously crunchy batter of these onion rings nearly had us fighting over them. Honestly, I didn\'t even mind that it was a touch too salty. 
when I stepped in, all I could smell was pancakes. Looking around the other tables, pancakes seemed to be on everyone\'s mind. \n<br />The buttermilk waffles were so fluffy I could die. \n<br />Ok, I\'m exaggerating but they were really fluffy with crispy brown edges. \n<br />The accompanying maple butter, was sweet but not cloying almost butterscotchy. \n<br />Personally I did not really fancy the blueberry compote not that it was bad. \n<br />Monster will be back for crispy pancake edges and banana walnut. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Pro tip- order this with a side of cheesy grits to feed 2 girls.
Biscuit sandwich with cheese, tomato sauce, an awesome scramble and really nice hash. Hearty portions (American!) So do share!
Poached eggs, maple-cured ham, classic Hollandaise, toasted buttermilk biscuit.
Happiness can be found in these round slabs of carbs! Here at Clinton Street after a 1.5 hour wait and I\'m glad to say my patience paid off!
Here\'s a [Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter with Blueberries S$18] - choice of banana walnut and chocolate chunk available. Love the maple butter, so want to drench my pancakes with it.

Definitely one of the more awesome pancakes and fried chicken waffles i had! üòâüëç
It looks really good but it tasted very bad!!!! I love rosti very much.. But when I cut it open. It doesn\'t look like potato to me. Try ordering this and you will understand what I mean. And to make it worst, it was undercooked! If you have been reading and researching about this particular dish: Crispy Potato Pancakes. It is lacking very much in the consistency of cooking this. Pictures had shown, it\'s either char dark brown which is closed to black or light brown like this. I ordered this because it has everything I love and I was preparing to send the food back to the kitchen if I got the burnt ones. I was delighted to see golden brown but instantly I was so upset when the potatoes are undercook. I\'m a chef by profession, I get very agitated when some chefs can\'t get their basics right. They should just use plain shredded potatoes with simple seasoning like salt n pepper. I have no idea what they added inside or did they soak the shredded potatoes in the water? Lower the heat so that the heat can penetrate through it without burning it. And instead of making it thick like pancake, spread it out to make it thinner so that it\'s not undercook. And in the menu it says caviar.. Was I expecting it to be the \"traditional\" caviar? Pancake was the only food that I tasted that\'s decent from Clinton Street Baking Company. Honestly, I will not go back there for breakfast or brunch. Unless I\'m just going there to have their pancakes. I must admit that their pancakes is pretty good though I didn\'t like the rest. They really need massive improvement especially grasping to cooking it right..
But this is definitely not the nicest around. The chefs really need to learn to control the fire and the brioche is a little too big, so when you eat from outer to the centre of it, the brioche was soggy. It will be best if they could cut it to smaller pieces, and cooked it individually. It will definitely help to retain it\'s fluffiness!
|\n<br />Buttermilk based pancake with blue berries sauce topping. It\'s texture was good (light brown on the outside and fluffy in the inside). I couldn\'t tell if they used \"real\" maple syrup from the heavily buttered butter maple syrup. Apart from these, I doubt I would re-visit for the pancake.\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Check out IG @jiaknonstop for the funny caption. üòÅ
|\n<br />Thick toast soaked up the milk and covered with egg. Browned on the outside and fluffy in the inside. Finished with some caramelized banana, whole walnut and sprinkled with brown sugar. .\n<br />|\n<br />I liked that the contrast in texture created by the walnut but whole walnut might be too big to eat. \n<br />Sadly, the only taste missing was \"sweet\". Even the banana tasted sweeter than the butter maple syrup and French toast. Maybe the kitchen running out of icing sugar because the brown sugar wasn\'t sweet enough.
|\n<br />Our potato pancakes had the perfect golden brown and crispy on the outside. The caviar and smoked salmon gave the savory taste to the pancake. If you can\'t take any \"fishy\" taste, you may want to the apple sauce version. Even thought the outside of the pancake was good, its inside had this \"raw\" potato texture. I believed that the chef was unable to control the temperature of the hot oil because of the overwhelming of orders rushing into the kitchen BUT for 19 dollars for three pieces of fried potato and piece of cold fish, I would expect more. .\n<br />|\n<br />My recommendation ‚û°Ô∏è Fried the potato under a low heat till light brown then finished it in the Air Fryer.
And it\'s the only dish that I personally think that passed the good mark. Distinct taste of buttermilk makes this three tier pancakes taste so good to able to eat on it\'s own.
Here\'s a breakdown of the items on this plate starting with my favourite:\n<br />‚Ä¢ The three pieces of fried green tomatoes had a refreshing tangy note which was well matched with the crunchy breadcrumb type of batter coating.\n<br />‚Ä¢ Sweet, sticky and a little on the chewy side, the four long strips of sugar-cured bacon strips were pretty good. I will likely get this as a side order when I return to wolf down more of Clinton St. Bakery\'s pancakes. \n<br />‚Ä¢ My choice of eggs cooked over-easy were spot-on.\n<br />‚Ä¢ Now comes the tricky part, the cheese grits. Made by boiling maize or corn, it reminded me of overcooked oats. I have to admit I am not a fan of its sludge-like texture but that\'s because grits is one of those love-it-or-hate-it food. Also, the cheese flavour was subtler than I thought it would be. \n<br />In conclusion, it\'s not likely I will have this dish again but only because I don\'t know how to appreciate grits. Besides, I\'m dying to try so many other dishes here! üòÜ
\"Bacon is like a high-five for my mouth.\" 
All I could think of was will its reputation precede itself? Will I be disappointed since I\'ve gotten myself so worked up with anticipation after reading all those raving reviews? The answer is a resounding NO. The pancakes here do indeed live up to the hype (at least in my opinion! üòÅ)\n<br />Served in a stack of three, they are perfectly imperfect; achieving the pinnacle in taste yet irregular enough in appearance to show they were made by hand. Like cushions that have never been sat on, they are full and fluffy. Texture-wise, they resemble a moist cake with a light crumb. And because we chose blueberries (the other options are chocolate chunk and banana walnut), our pancakes came polka-dotted with the dark fruit. Topping the stack was a blueberry compote that\'s not too sweet (which suits me fine) but the warm maple butter sauce (served on the side) is literally, THE icing on the cake. There is nothing in Singapore that tastes quite like it. I was almost giddy over its yumminess. \n<br />This item is pretty large so I recommend ordering one to share so you can also try the other dishes on their menu.
Bakery w the folks. In frame is their highly raved wild blueberries pancakes $18 &amp; chicken waffle $21. Pancake lovers will find joy in this popular stack. üç¥|\n<br />Eggs Benedict $20 on the other hand was a tad disappointing, all of us didn\'t fancy d buttermilk biscuit instead of muffin. Portion is rather generous, my favorite pick is the crispy potato pancakes $14!
Blueberries Pancake with Warm Maple Butter | $18 - even the pancake\'s core is filled with blueberries, my favourite among the lot! 
ÊÄª‰∫éÂà∞‰∫Ü Clinton ÂêÉÂçàÈ§ê! [Crispy Potato Pancakes S$14] - Super crispy and it comes with caramelised applesauce and sour cream. My favourite dish today, out of the 4 we had!
After three visits to Clinton St, I think their tastiest dishes are the most underrated ones. Take this burger for example: a moist and flavourful housemade patty, beautifully charred and cooked to a perfect medium rare, topped with gooey melted cheese, and slapped between toasted soft buns. It\'s without a question one of the best fuss-free burgers I\'ve had. Helps that the accompanying handcut fries were nothing short of addictive.
A thing of beauty. But the crabcakes, while good, were just a nice-to-have. The biscuits (instead of English muffins) stole the show. Sense but fluffy, and a little sweet. Drenched in Hollandaise sauce, they\'re amazing. 
Don\'t know if it\'s just me, but I didn\'t like their pancakes very much. The first bite into that fluffy stack was pretty awesome: cloud-like texture and a good sweet and buttery flavour. But once it cooled - which it did really quickly - it was more dry and dense than it was moist and airy. 
I can\'t wait to dig in!! The smell of pancakes is torturing me üò®üò®üò® #TGIF #burpple
How about some wild blueberry shake? Not as sweet compare to the rootbeer float and packed with antioxidants üòçüòçüòç
American-sized, I strongly suggest you to share the thick fluffy stacks of pancakes among a couple of friends because I noted quite a few tables didn\'t manage to finish even half of it and especially so if you want to try the other dishes. Atop a dense Belgian vanilla buttermilk waffle, the buttermilk fried chicken was crisp and not oily but the drizzle of honey-Tabasco sauce did not suit my palate and I would have prefer it a more crispy airy texture for the waffle.
Pancakes are good but like the NY outlet, the real star is the warm maple butter. Side of sugar cured bacon is good too.
Still think this is one of the best stacks of pancakes you can get in town. Each mammoth-sized disc of batter is thick, fluffy and moist, embedded throughout AND topped with wild blueberries ‚Äì they\'re more flavoursome than the larger blueberries. If I could have a pancake pillow, I\'d get mine from Clinton St.
[Clinton Street Bakery Company] Helming from the Big Apple, New York City and, touted as \"legendary\" and \"best pancakes\" from various sources, Clinton Street Baking Co is finally here in Singapore. Backed by its numerous accolades, did it lived up to expectations?
One of the less hyped up dishes here that really should receive more recognition is this. The base looks like an ordinary English muffin, but inspect it a little closer and you\'ll realise it\'s a toasted buttermilk biscuit ‚Äì crumbly and crusty around the edges, moist and dense in the middle.
- loving my quick catchup with the favourite girlfriend @claudiayong yesterday, over fluffy blueberries pancakes and her flying trip stories.
Think fluffy, eggy and moist slices of brioche, drenched in a delectable warm melted butter maple sauce. I looooved the crisp surface and absolutely buttery insides that just readily soaks up any sauce. It might\'ve been better paired with the usual sharper, cleaner tasting maple syrup, since the brioche itself is pretty buttery. Nonetheless a sinfully yummy dish (defo wins their waffle hands down).
I thought that this dish was pretty awesome. It was my first time having savoury waffle and it was actually better than I had expected. The waffle was fluffy, good enough to be eaten on its own. The fried chicken slices were very well-marinated, but maybe a little dry. Nevertheless, they were definitely tasty especially if you dip them into the sauce!
Yes the chicken is crispy but I found the batter too thick. I had to use some strength to \"poke\" my fork into the chicken. The taste was rather light and not as savory as it looks. If you are game for sweet fried chicken, do dip the maple butter sauce. 
After reading many reviews from Burpple, I have to visit Clinton which finally opened in Singapore on 19 September. 
New York\'s famed Clinton Street which arrived last week, is known for their pancakes with warm maple butter (which we opted for Banana Walnut). $18. Fluffy, nicely crisped at the edges, and quite a thick slab that\'s good for more than 2 people. Stuffed with banana in the middle, and perfect crunch with the walnut\'s nutty goodness. Also ordered another carb-loaded Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich ($13.50), but the star of which was the scrambled egg at best. Buttermilk biscuit was dense and tasted doughy, you\'re probably better off eating Popeyes\'. Served also with a very disappointing cold hash brown, and tomato jam on buttermilk biscuit (Added $2 for bacon, crispy but nothing to shout about). Today\'s brunch for 2 was an overkill. (Table of 2 girls next to us ordered THREE dishes and we were anticipating how much they could finishüòÇ) 
Came here wanting the chicken waffle and pancakes, but ended up being more impressed with the other less promoted dishes. The chicken waffle was a disappointment... soggy waffle bleah! The pancakes were fluffy and thick, quite satisfying though I heard the original NY version is much better, and I would love to have more blueberry topping too üòÅ The favourite turned out to be the obscure potato pancakes - smoked salmon was just a bonus to the already scrumptious mini-\'rostis\' (but much more fried and crispy). 
Woohoo. Where are you gg for your brunch today? \n<br />In frame is a glass of velvety smooth blueberry shake from @clintonst_sg. Best to be share with a fren for a greater gastronomic experience. üòãüòãüòã\n<br />Thank you @danielfooddiary for the treat. üòÅüòÅReview is up on blog at Hannahchia.blogspot.com
Baking Company &amp; Restaurant. Yes, it has finally open its flagship in Singapore. Rated as the best pancakes by New York Magazine twice! Have you tried their fluffy pancakes? Check out my review.
Hailing all the way from the Big Apple, Clinton Street Baking Company has landed on Singapore\'s shores. Best known for their buttermilk fried chicken that is tender beyond belief and fried to golden-brown perfection, their Chicken &amp; Waffles ($21) would be an easy choice, though some may find their waffles on the denser side. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken Plate ($25) is probably a better option, especially for sharing. The three-piece platter comes with a choice of a side (saut√©ed spinach, sweet potato fries or moreish cheese grits) and a sweet-spicy Honey Tabasco. This will leave you some space for their thick, fluffy Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18) and a topping of your choice ‚Äì blueberries, banana walnut or chocolate chunks. Prices might seem a little steep, but their hearty portions will certainly make it worth your while! 
Milkshake and pretty girls, shake it mama, shake it!
I would indeed be hesitant. the thick stacks were fragrant but what left me way disappointed was that an add on of butter maple syrup would cost me another $2. seriously, the first serving wasn\'t even able to drench our first stack. we would prolly need 4 portions.
Becos #mybreakfastisbetterthanyours \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/09/22/clintonst/
Not because it came with some fancy schmancy Korean-esque sauce, or had some mindblowingly awesome crust; but cause they nailed what all others haven\'t: a perfectly tender and juicy chicken breast. Underneath the super-thin yet undoubtedly crisp batter, lay the moist, juicy, and succulent chicken breast. It stole the show. 
The pancakes were fluffy and fat, topped with wild blueberries, banana walnut or chocolate chunk toppings, which you can drizzle over with awesome homemade maple butter.
Holding several \"Best titles\" across the media, we had high expectation for it!
üòçüòçüòç\n<br />Whoop so excited to try this highly famed diner that hails all the way from NYC!! The pancakes were so big and so fluffy!! Got a \'lil dry at the end but the maple butter syrup should help. Hehe give me pancakes and fruits and I\'m a happy girl üôÜüòÅ
My first upside-down cake and I really love it! Don\'t mind the sweetness of the pineapple slices atop but love how they seemed to have used grounded almonds for this cake, which although dense, was immensely different in flavour. This made me had reminders of the Orange Almond Cake at Cakes Literally which is sadly closed, and I had been looking around for a similar one.
Girlfriend was super excited about coming here and insisted we go on opening day so off we went. Kudos to the great service, especially on opening day, with attentive but unobtrusive staff who topped up water regularly and the food arrived relatively quickly given the full house. The buttermilk pancake stack was impressively fluffy and toasty on the exterior, ticking all the right boxes in terms of the appropriate levels of thickness, texture and softness. Unfortunately, it gets a bit dry and claggy in the mouth. I wish the bananas atop and studded in the pancakes were also a little more caramelized and moist, just something to counteract the dryness of it all. What was to die for and what everyone raves about is the maple butter sauce, which was so full of butterscotchy goodness I could drink it straight from the saucer. 
This is what happens when Chorizo, Tomatoes, Caramalised Onions, Scallions, melted Monterey Jack meet a scramble made of not one, not two, but three eggs?! This was breakfast fit for the King; fresh, slight runny eggs, with the tanginess of tomatoes, savouriness of the chunky chorizo they are so generous with a kiss of sweetness from the melted onions along with that sinful, gooey cheese atop, each slice of the scramble makes you yearn for more. Honestly there is no need for bread with this, and with so many eggs this would make for that power breakfast you WOULD need. It\'s so satisfying that it made my day and I wish to come back again just for it!
Buttermilk Fried Chicken is a big thing in Clinton Street Baking Company\'s menu, where you can get it in several forms from a sandwich to even having it atop a Buttermilk Waffle. If you are looking for something less the carbs, you could perhaps decide on this Buttermilk Fried Chicken Plate which allows you to pick from several sides listed in the menu. We got ourselves the Sweet Potato Fries; thinly-cut but with the sweet earthy flavours evident with adequate seasoning in salt. Fried Chicken was well fried with a crispy batter but succulent and juicy skin without being oily, though it does not the accompanying Honey Tabasco dip to give it flavour; just think along the lines of spicy maple syrup. And that slaw was in fact creamy and crunchy, served cold; the way it should have been. Fried Chicken lovers would love this, though you might want to consider sharing it for each serving comes with three pieces; a tad huge to finish alone.
Clinton Street Baking Company surprisingly uses Two Degrees North blends, a local roaster for their coffee. The House Blend is light with floral flavours which is clean without leaving too much an aftertaste, which helps to wash away any strong flavours from the food pretty well.
Possibly the best fried chicken and waffles I\'ve had in town so far, and I\'m not saying this just because @sixthsensepr is handling the account. If you like this \"soul food\" dish, you\'d best come try this rendition by acclaimed Clinton Street Baking Co. of New York fame when they open their Singapore outpost this coming Saturday.
I didn\'t expect this to be so well-cooked but that firm, spongey texture gave it a smart, tidy form. It also cocooned the two selected fillings of chopped tomatoes and mushrooms well.\n<br />Having said that, I plan to ask for it to be cooked runnier, softer the next time. And yes, a less pristine shape is fine by me. 
Perfect combination to have strawberry and pancake together! Wish they could serve this throughout the year! Add another side with fries and it is pretty good too

Be it their well fried breaded salmon burger [$24] or their Spanish Scramble [$21] bean-containing dish (which thankfully doesn\'t taste like Makani Bean Stew) or the oatmeal tasting cheese gratin [$5], there just seems to be an interesting touch to everything. Their signature Blueberry Pancakes [$19] was to DIE FOR though, and I am not even exaggerating - crispy on the outside, nice warm and fluffy on the inside and finish it with a really generous serving of blueberries and pair it with melted butter in maple syrup - simply heavenly. \n<br />On a side note, I\'ll probably only come back when im not in a 130k++ debt anymore. üòÇ
i\'m quite happy to pull a Maccas shake for $3.50 anytime. best news is, this Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake didn\'t disappoint. thick and not-too-sweet, it\'s perfect for anyone who wants their desserts but not willing to potentially suffer from diabetes!
the 3 thick slabs of fluffiness was too much carbs for one person (actually, more like too boring) so you\'ve got to share it to be able to fully enjoy this. to be really really honest though, i couldn\'t taste anything distinct about the pancakes and wouldn\'t likely come back just for it \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @chopesg #chopesg @clintonst_sg #clintonstreetbakingcompany #pancakes #breakfast #brunch #dessert #chocolate

Time for some brandy... lookalike in the Ethiopian Cold Brew. \n<br />The Coffea Arabica which originates from Ethiopia is aromatic with a slight and pleasant acidity. The sweet aftertaste and the hint of bitterness puts it in the category of among the finest coffee in the world.
A generous dollop of chantilly cream atop 3 fluffy, soft pancakes, garnished with apples and candied walnuts. The maple butter was soo good with the pancake, making each bite of pancake to be heavenlyüòç Pricey($19) yes, but it is seriously hands down the best pancake I\'ve ever tasted. So delicious!

National maple syrup day!
Chicken and waffles never fail.
Best combination tgt with the slightly sweet fried chicken and warm maple syrup. PERFECT.

I loved the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. And their buttermilk onion rings!! @clintonst_sg
Naise üòç
I was not disappointed by it. The pancakes were soft and fluffy. The most unique thing about the pancakes was probably the syrup. Instead of having usual maple syrup, it came with some kind of brown syrup which tasted like butterscotch to me. .\n<br />.\n<br />#pancakes #breakfast #clintonstreetbakingcompany #cafelife #cafehopping #sgcafes #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #sgig #ASandHP #happybirthday #sgfoodie #eatoutsg #burpple
Actually wanted some hot chocolate coz I saw the table beside having it with marshmallows on top but can\'t find it in the menu. Tried to make a guess if it\'s Mocha but I\'m wrong „Äã$6.50

Biting into warm, soft and fluffy pancakes makes me really happy. Definitely worth a revisit!

I went for yoga core class before this plate of sin and @jnetvoo told us to set our motivation for class. Clearly my motivation = pancakes üòù .

Of course, cannot finish, tapow also. üòùüì¶
We actually ordered 3 dishes to share between the two of us. Stuffed ourselves while chit-chatting.  Be prepared to queue up as the place gets really busy.
Best pancakes ever!! Warm fluffy &amp; soft topped with blueberries and warm maple butter!! üòª .\n<br />.
So good and huge portion, good for two!

They opened a branch here at purvis street sg. Fluffy pancakes with ur choice of blueberries, banana walnut or Choc chunk and homemade maple butter. Sure did not disappoint!
Feeling very thirsty on a Thursday night after this so bleah cappuccino and pancakes. Only saving grace was the ambience. #thirstday #latergram #throwback #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burpple #pancakes #clintonstreetsg #igsg #sgig #sgigfoodies #sggluttons #sgcafefood #sgfoodtrend #cafehoppingsg

The stack of thick yet somehow fluffy pancakes were totally worth the wait. Buttermilk chicken and buttermilk biscuits were just meh. Make sure you order the Salted Caramel Boozy Shake to wash it all down. We ordered a lot of food but @mayann and I did a good job of annihilating all the food on the tiny table, and we survived to tell the tale! #foodgasm #foodporn #foodstagram #instaeats #instafood #instagood #burpple #sgfoodies #sgcafehop #coffeeaddict #coffeeholic
Featuring Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter and Blueberries. #Burpple #NoFilter
Waited for nearly an hour for a table. Luckily the pancakes didn\'t disappoint. Thick and fluffy! If only they were more generous with the blueberry... Then it would have been perfect! 
My streaky, sugar-cured bacon lying in a tantalising heap alongside the buttermilk fried chicken. The latter was crisp on the outside and juicily tender inside (maybe except for the breast-dry). With some self-deception, the little cup of crunchy slaw on the side took some guilt points off this overall sinful plate. #brunch #brunchtime #burpple #friedchicken #yummy #foodporn #foodgasm #foodpics #foodie #igfood #instafood #foodstagram #igfoodie #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgeats #eatoutsg #foodphotography #igdaily #picoftheday

one with lotsa maple, fluffy yet fragrant. yeap I want pancakes on this rainy monday night.
So depraved in silkiness I swear it\'s barely legal. Which is probably why just like Rihanna and her entourage, it comes surrounded on all sides by its gang of housemade sausage patties (these were slightly sweet and yummy), little blocks of cheddar cheese, grilled tomatoes and toasted sourdough. #veronicaphuaeats #clintonstreetbakingcompanysg #Burpple #clintonstreetbakingcompany #brunch #whati8today #sgeats #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #BurppleTastemaker

rosti. And to our dismay, it was too charred and oily. :/ I guess the smoked salmon was the saving grace! üòÖ
Backed by its numerous accolades, did it lived up to expectations?\n<br />.\n<br />My order of the Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter (with wild blueberries, $18) definitely did! I have always been on the waffles side but I was totally sold by their pancakes. The three thick fluffy pancakes stack with warm maple butter lifts even the dullest mood. They could have given more wild blueberries which would make it even more impressive. Great for sharing but if you ever needed a hearty meal, go for the full plate. If I ever crave for any pancakes in future, I now know where to get them.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 31 Purvis Street, Singapore 188608\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #foodporn #foodphoto #makan #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
BEST PANCAKES 
Very dense cake, tad sweet for me.
Came out slightly dry for me.  I think I prefer Montana Brew Bar\'s version better.  The maple butter pancakes with blueberries were pretty good though.
