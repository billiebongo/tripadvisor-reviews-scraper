Or a cuppa from 40 hands will do just fine! $8 for a cup of iced mocha is a bit painful, but it\'s really, really good.\n<br />.\n<br />üöá TIONG BAHRU. 78 Yong Siak Street, #01-12, Singapore 163078.
I still think their food is a little overpriced. And average tasting.
The pasta cooked Al-dente, just the right amount of cheese, and the truffles, my gawd, it\'s just what I needed on a Monday. And yes #fortyhands is finally opened on Monday. Hurrah. Come get your brunch fix today. Review is out on bakchormeeboy.wordpress.com @commonmancoffee #macandcheese #truffle #truffles #trufflemacandcheese
Yesterday\'s breakfast, lunch and teabreak all in this Eggs Benedict with Steak and spicy potatoes ($21), with @thisisadaaaaa!
Got my hands on this delicious baby - caramelised bacon atop soft fluffy French toast, with sliced bananas. A healthy start to the day - what\'s not to love?
Back at #fortyhandscafe, and I must say that I really like the food here so far: filling, satisfying and tastes good!üëç The iced mocha is great too; it has somewhat of a nutty flavor, which is different from most iced-chocolate-tasting ones ‚òïÔ∏è @ Yong Siak Streetüìç ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />üöáNearest Station: Tiong Bahru, Exit B
Braved the rain today to get to #fortyhandscafe at Yong Siak Streetüìç after seeing @rollingchubbychefs post about the Big Boy Breakfast, which had me absolutely looking forward to it. (Oh yes, I\'m a fan of hearty brunches.)

Forty Hands has always been the place I\'d like to have this pau. It has thin layer of pau with good tasting tau sar or red bean paste. Yummy. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 5
\"Hands down, tables down, fork and spoon down, one of the BEST french toasts ever!!!\" Burpple Tastemaker Kieffer Tay just can\'t contain his excitement over Forty Hand\'s Banana Bacon French Toast ($17) ‚Äî and rightly so. Soft and crispy, salty and sweet, this fluffy brioche French toast is loaded with just the right amount of fragrant egginess, topped with generous portions of crispy bacon and sweet banana slices, all while sitting in a pool of maple syrup. If you prefer bananas over berries on your French toast, this one\'s your jam.        
Two soft fluffy brioche on a bed of maple syrup. Absolutely delicious! Somehow the maple syrup wasn\'t cloying, going very well with the perfect French toast. The super crisp streaky bacon provided a good savoury biscuit like munch. If only the bananas were caramelised, it would have been perfect.
Except they didn\'t taste fresh. Donut wasn\'t fluffy inside at all, being rather stale and dry. It was also painfully plain without the Greek yogurt or chocolate dip. There was a copious amount of cinnamon sugar which didn\'t sit too well with me too. 
Hands down, tables down, fork and spoon down, one of the BEST french toasts ever!!! Rocketing its way up to the top of my list and sitting nicely with Ronin\'s version is this lovely sweet savoury concoction.
Egg Benedict with Organic bacon, saut√©ed baby spinach with side of spicy roasted potatoes 
Truly what they are known for - REALLY AWESOME COFFEE. I would highly suggest to come by during the weekdays too as it is much quieter and you can enjoy the cup slowly while enjoying the nice hipster cafe setting. Not the cheapest cup of flat white, but definitely hands down one of the best. üëçüèª
The combination of maple-syrup drenched frencf toast and crispy bacon was divine!
Dropped by Forty Hands for their Banana Bacon French Toast. One of the more memorable french toasts I\'ve had in recent times #nofilter
Two perfectly poached eggs sitting atop juicy beef steaks, served with a side of spicy potato. All it takes is one bite to remind me why I fell in love with Eggs Benedict in the first place
The set of two Asian Sliders ($7.50) is really just kong bak pau\'s alias. They were surprisingly yummy (but a tad too salty) and filling. Extremely worth the money, I would say, especially when they gave more than just two thick slices of pork belly for each steamed bun. The truffle fries ($9) were also too salty and oily but decent. I\'ve had better ones at Strangers\' Reunion.
This didn\'t taste like many cakes out there but I still felt it\'s a bit pricey. The top half was cheesecake-like and had a light lemon flavour. The bottom half reminded me vaguely of  chewy protein bars. It was dense in texture and seemed to contain grated coconut.
Come here for a good cuppa with the best pillowy-soft Tau Sar Pau you can find, before heading out to the next relative\'s home! Alternatively, start your day here with a hearty breakfast.\n<br /> \n<br />*Closed on 18th Feb
Love the break yoghurt dressing and the taste of pickled beets with pumpkin stripes. Basically everything that I love on a plate. Will definitely go back for more. 
Nothing can stop us from cafe hopping everyday~ I had Muscle Mary Salad w/ chicken ($17) while my darling had Kong Bak Pau Set of 3 ($10) &amp; accompanied with a large size of cappuccino ($7+)  this meal is way pricey but good food xD
This fluffy cupcake had a core of grated coconut and \"gula melaka\" and was crowned with \"pandan\" frosting. I can imagine how easy it was for the sweetness to go overboard but it\'s well controlled here.\n<br />Comparisons are inevitable when a Western type of dessert is done with a beloved traditional local dessert flavour. Personally, I thought this was a good effort. 
Missin\' these sinful devils desserts! üòã people who are sourish food lovers, you must definitely try these! I recommend the key lime tart üôã
Beautifully-pulled Flat White using blends from Common Man Coffee Roasters (both Common Man and Forty Hands are by the Spa Espirit group). It\'s bold-flavoured body and finish makes it a perfect for a wake-me-up in the morning!
Didn\'t want to stop by any cafe but gave in just for this; after all it\'s my first time successfully finding my way here after several attempts. Totally worth it though; that pillowy soft bun that bounces with sweet red bean paste that filled the insides well; great snack for the mid-day tea time treat! 
They use coffee blend from Common Man Coffee Roaster. Now the best but good enough for caffeine fix. 
One does not resist a good cup of coffee after a long day being under the scorching sun. Without fail, that I will definitely visit them whenever I\'m at Yong Saik St. I\'ve patronized Forty Hands for coming about 4 years now, ever since they just opened and seen a change of dining space after their recent revamping of new concept and interior looks! They\'re one of the cafe that brings in Five Senses coffee beans in Singapore. 
Forty Hands serves CMCR espresso as their primary blend, it\'s purely roasted by Common Man Coffee Roaster. A medium bodied coffee bean that has a much bolder after taste &amp; less acidity than any other coffee beans that usually has an after sour taste. The barista surely knows his audience with the coffee he serves, if you\'re caffeine lover. There more variety on other choices like filtered coffees or premium beans like single origin &amp; v60 for you to decide!
Cendol cupcake - amazing!! The salmon hash was the best and the truffles mushroom dish. Probably my second favourite brunch place in Singapore after common man
But seems like they changed their barista and coffee isn\'t good anymore.
Line centre is brilliantly sour. Nicely balanced with the sweetness and slight saltiness of the meringue and base. Though would have like the meringue to be a bit stiffer and the base a little firmer. Could have said it about a lot of other things #burpple #foodporn #dessert #keylime
Reminded me of the good old A&amp;W days. The sour cream definitely add another level of flavour and it goes will with the pork sausages and bolognese. Wasn\'t sure there was any scramble eggs. And who can forget about the bacon! Yes I said BACON!! #burpple #foodporn #hotdog
Food was alright. More mayo please!! Ambience was there just that table looks old and dirty. /: A great place to chillax if you are in that area!
Eggs Benedict with a twist! Poached egg on juicy steak with fluffy muffin and yummy spicy roasted potatoes! 
I love tarts and this tart was just staring back at me while I was ordering my food. But was slightly disappointed by it :/ the crust was a little soggy and lemon was not tart enough. At least it\'s pretty?
Great cuppa!! A hidden cafe at Tiong Bahru Forty Hands serves their own range of beans and caters hearty breakfasts for residents around. A must to visit! 
Gourmet hot dog at the cafe. Pork or beef sausage with bolognese meat sauce topped with scrambled egg and crispy bacon. Quite pricy though. Cost $15.
Hmmmm..... Nth special lor.... Only had one bite on the bread... #dontlikeit
The new space is brighter and bigger. Coffee\'s still good as usual.
This carrot cake is moist, chock full of carrots and fruits, and covered in a good amount of cream cheese frosting. Rest assured the cream cheese frosting isn\'t the watered down overly sweet kind. The slice is quite small though so you may need seconds üòÅ Forty hands also makes a good cuppa!
Do you like breakfast? Do you like hotdogs? Then you\'ll love The Big Bang - A Guinness beef and pork sausage is practically buried under slatherings of Bolognese, scrambled egg, sour cream, chilli flakes and crispy bacon. 
retro + modern = sugar in an old used open can, water in a syrup medicine brown bottle and hot chocolate 
In need of a good read and picture ogling going to bed tonight? Then look no further and read up my review on Forty Hands! You won\'t be disappointed by the hotdogs pics that I assure you.
Good Brunch at Forty Hands with @emidreams today... the food was delicious!! #burpple
Just by stepping into Forty Hands, I begin to feel artsy and hip. The furniture, cool graffiti and the outdoor sitting area all adds up to the experience. The Big Bang was certainly filling with tons of ingredients, but the star of the day was the truffle fries! The tasty sticks of potatoes sprinkled with  truffle oil were delicious and I couldn\'t stop eating the salty and tangy snack.
#Brunch at 6pm. Thank God for #caf√©s serving all-day-breakfast! Big Boy Breakfast for me after a tiring day taking buses &amp; trains juggling 2 bags &amp; a 10kg toddler in Manduca.. And a squirmy toddler for Heguru class! #alldaybreakfast #roscafehops #fortyhands
Very nice latte at Forty Hands but the cake was not so good!
truffle fries
ang mo classic
the big bang
regular cappuccino
Salt Cod Mash Toasties (U.P. $12) with pur√©e of cod fish and potato, garlic and herb to spice it up!
The BIG Bang gourmet dawg! Guinness beef and pork sausage, topped with bacon, bolognese, sour cream, scrambled eggs and chili flakes!
Truffle Fries! üçü Once a potato lover, always a po-ta-to lover!
Flavor sustains in the short finish, but fades slightly in the long. 
Good fatty stuff right there! The only time I eat stewed pork belly is when they are served in hot steamed buns. 
Not bad but a little salty. My grandma\'s kongbapau is still unbeatable!!!üòÇ
Best tausar pau I\'ve had! Soft fluffy warm with yummy filling that\'s not too sweet. Love it^^
Best red bean bun ever! Ate 1 there and dabao 2 home! 
Each time I take a casual walk around the neighbourhood, something new pops up around the corner :) Plain Vanilla has recently moved their kitchen from Holland Village to this second (and larger) branch at Yong Siak Street. Absolutely love the raw, rustic space. Charming.

finally checking out forty hands. heard much about it and am glad i finally came. took a while to find it but was so excited when we found it, amongst the other lil cafes and shops around the area. the cafe was pretty full but we managed to get some seats. you could choose to sit outside the cafe, inside, or at the back end of the cafe where its non air conditioned but much airy-er and spacious than the inside of the cafe where its air conditioned. so, since we came for the coffee, i decided to try the mocha instead of going for my usual hot choc. and i chose the big boy breakfast - some bread, spicy chipotle sausage, bacon, bolognaise (real good!) , sauteed shrooms, roasted (gigantic) tomatoes and choice of eggs (i chose scrambled). am glad the food and coffee didnt disappoint, and would love to come back again! to check out their kong ba pao (?!) and their cookies and cakes! 
Coffee lives up to the many stellar reviews Forty Hands has gotten!
This is ANG MO CLASSICS. Basically hotdog! Haha! Im passing the challenge on to @beixin, with tag #style! First time that came into my mind! üòâHehe! so the rule is to take 5 shots and post in 5days and to tag a different person each time!! Have fun babe!üòò

#Latergram: Flat White from last night. Have been taking a lot of coffee since the promos season started. Just three more days and it\'s over. Make it or not, I think I tried lah hor...
Carrot cake for you? Tinge of lemon zest, I like! @fanaticbananas Look here!
The night didn\'t just end with chicken rice, we went for more pigging out at Forty Hands. Their famous Tao Sar Pau and Carrot Cake with a tinge of lemon zest! And yea together with good coffee of course. üòå Great Friday night, before math and biology flood me the next few days... üòî
Worth a (re)visit for their chocolate tarts. This and iced latte!

Both my friend and I had the Pesto Chicken Panini ($16), I thought it was good but she didn\'t like it. Friend hadba flat white, wasn\'t very impressive and had a bitter aftertaste. The side of fries that came were surprisingly truffle fries and they were not bad! Could have given more though üòÅ. Probably wouldn\'t return as their menu is quite limited.
This cuppa is really intense.. Bold flavours of bitterness and sweetness. Really good to start the day with!
Light, fluffy, soft, fragrant and perfect level of sweetness. There\'s nothing else to complain other than the fact that they have only one leftüò™üò™ #DACatTiongBaru #burpple

As with most dishes here, the serving size is quite big. I love the eggs as the yolks are still quite runny when being served! Runny eggs just as i love them! The veggie is very nicely done without being over-cooked. The only let down is the bacon and potatoes. The bacon is overly salty and the potatoes are too \"well fried\". But overall very nice! #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafe #cafeculture #cafe #singapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #eggsbenedict #eggs #eggsbenedictwithbacon #bacon #foodie #foodporn #burpple #brunch #foodstagram #yongsiakcafe #tiongbahrucafe #40hands #40handscoffee #fortyhandscoffee #fortyhands
Big serving size! There are chunks of salmons &amp; potatoes in the soup and the breads are thick and nicely toasted! Load of fries too!

Cappuccino is always a good way to test how good the coffee is. Smooth and fragrant. But would I come all the way here just for a cup, probably not. The cafe is too crowded and noisy over weekends and public holidays.
