last week\'s dinner w my favourite at one of the place we fell in love with truffle fries/always frequent ‚Ä¢
Returned here after two years for this mussels and clams pot. The broth has been changed (used to be a clear broth instead of a milky one) but still delicious. The mains here are on the pricier side but I guess the huge portions make up for it. 
($14++) Grand Marnier Infused Brioche, Banana, Roasted Almonds, Dark Chocolate Ice Cream, Mascarpone Cheese- a gorgeously plated sweet garden is served... Looks delightfully, taste harmoniously sweet, fruity and decadent (rich ice cream, with mmhmm mascarpone cheese)  
That Wagyu and mushroom + pepperoni and prosciutto. And that portobello fries! Second birthday meal before the new year with @bforbern. Thank you for all the insults that you throw my way and keeping me grounded all the time üôÑ. You\'ve seen the worst, but still believe in the best of me. Okthatsall. Donthaolian. Kthxbye.
Back for their wagyu pizza üòç. On a side note, how did they make their fries fully infused with truffle?! I could still taste it every time I burp üôäüôà
Weird that the bacon has sweet taste... Other than that, the combination is nice.
Quite pleased with what I ordered, although I wish the prices weren\'t this steep for a casual eatery. I also wish this weren\'t on the other side of Singapore - but oh well.
Tender and succulent beef is what every customer dreams of and I wasn\'t disappointed when I visited the coastal settlement that day. Meat was absolutely tender and there was a reduction sauce which worked perfectly with it. It also came with mushrooms and a salad! Definitely a must try here. 
Here for the August baby bday celebration with the colleagues and was greeted by this flowy goodness! Unlike most molten lava cakes, this one is crispier on the outside, like a soft biscuit. And the insides, are just soft and flowy as ever! Comes with a mint ice cream so for all you chocolate mint lovers out there, this one\'s definitely for you!
The best dish I\'ve had today at TCS. Just 4 words to describe the beef. Melt-in-the-mouth. (I so wanna have it again!)
Nice food and nice environment at the far east side of the island.
A delish hearty starters. Otah tasted super awesome and definitely goes well with d toast. The wings.. Hmm.. A must try. 
Freshly pressed-waffle with roasted honey macadamia nuts, banana froster and vanilla bean ice cream on a small pool of maple syrup. If you are looking for a \'ulu\' cafe to escape, The Coastal Settlement should be at the top of your list. They pull out all the stops with the lush greenery, vintage furniture and collectables to allow you to immerse in the nostalgic experience at the outskirts of town. As for the menu, they offered both local and western staples.
Wagyu beef slices on pizza? Why not! Beef was well done and marinated nicely to bring out the flavour. Saut√©ed mushrooms helped alleviate the monotony of eating meat. The caramelised onions brought an unwelcome sweetness, but the abundant mozzarella and cheddar made up for it! On the other side is the pepperoni and prosciutto. The saltiness of the prosciutto went well with the fresh olive and chilli. And again, the cheese is to die for. All for $25++.
Don\'t let the name fool you, the Tom yum isn\'t all that spicy. Good flavour, with lots of garlic but it wasn\'t as creamy as I would want it to be. The seafood is pretty generous and fresh! Prawns, mussels, squid and a never ending pile of clams. The arugula adds a nice touch to the dish. Spaghetti was al dante but quite average. Priced at $25++. On a weekday lunch, the place was nearly full house. Was greeted by a brusque \"how many?\" Which made my day really, because it was so direct and funny. 
They had a Mother\'s Day menu so I had the paella which had a local flavour with Chinese sausage added, my friend had the rosti with sausage which was a big serving but too salty. We did enjoy the chocolate lava cake that oozed out liquid cocoa seductively, and nicely paired with the After Eight mint choc ice cream. Nice forest-y setting but food is quite average. #Burpple
Revisited this cafe numerous times because of the awesome environment and food.
A great dish here along with the truffle mushroom linguine!!! Pastas here are great!! We tried the 5 cheese pizza, pot of mussel and clams too! Would recommend the pot for sharing with its generous portion and tasty broth that you dip the accompanying baguette in! 
The roasted chicken at the coastal settlement was good, but not mind blowing. Good points- it\'s worth the price (good sized 1/2 chicken) and pretty tasty. I would not drive from west to east just to have this dish though. I would recommend this place for medium sized groups looking for a place with a chill vibe, cosy decorations and solid western food (I did not try their Singaporean/asian dishes)! 
I had such a positive impression of the \"Truffle Eggs and Mushrooms\" ($24++) when I was here about a year ago but unfortunately, it seems to have lost a little bit of lustre when I had it again today. The truffle aroma in the egg wasn\'t as intense as before, the Parma ham that I swopped for smoked salmon previously has done a disappearing act although the price remains the same, and the slice of bread underneath all that was a bit hard. Out of the three people who ordered this dish, two of us left the bread practically untouched (me included).
We had the Wagyu and prawn half and half combo for the pizza and it was a good decision coz both were yummy! Loved the caramelised onions and generous beef toppings and the fresh prawns. 
$14++. Freshly pressed waffles, berries compete, Nutella, homemade ice cream, chantilly cream.
Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside!! I adore it!
Served with truffle mayo. üçÑüçüüòãüëç PS: Best eaten when hot!
Hidden place in the East nearby the old Changi Hospital! Upon entering, what attracted me first was their interior decor. The place was filled with vintage pieces like vespas, bicycles, old display cabinets, typwriters, oil paintings and even their tables+chairs were vintage like.\n<br />Order their signature Big Breakfast\n<br />Runny eggs -Check\n<br />Cheese sausage - Check \n<br />Portobello mushrooms - Check \n<br />Bacon that is not too hard - Check \n<br />Side salad - Check \n<br />Overall it was a nice dish, my only regret was that I wish had more room to try their sides. They look fantastic!
sausages. egg. I guess I\'m getting tired of such food. we need a new cruisine in sg. anyone agree?
It was an amazing place with great food and beautiful ambience,i enjoyed it so much
The roast chicken was so tasty and not forgetting yhe prawn agio oilo it had a very unique taste
The epitome of fries. Absolutely nailed it. It\'s funny how hard it is to find good fries that are crisp on the outside, soft and pillowy on the inside, and most importantly seasoned perfectly. This ticked all the boxes. I would üç¥(fork) out the $15 for this. It may disappoint truffle lovers though cause the truffle flavour ain\'t that strong. Other reviewers say it is - inconsistency perhaps?
It\'s my first time having holicks milkshake and I love it! It\'s so thick and creamy!
Truffle fries, eggs ben, half and half pizza of beef&amp;mushroom/5 cheese. The 5 cheese pizza was so good! And so were the eggs ben, it was well seasoned, flavourful and delicious. The great food was accompanied by an amazing ambience. Whether you are seated inside or out it\'s beautiful. I\'ll definitely be back for more. 
A good cuppa by the window or maybe some truffle fries would be a pretty great way to spend the weekends - can\'t believe it\'s only Tuesday.
Brilliant taste of the juicy meat and cheese bursting into your mouth within one bite.
$24, damn filling. Sausage, potatoes, scrambled egg, bacon, creamy mushroom, salad. Never expected bacon to ever go wrong but I didn\'t like this bacon.
Rustic charm - food wasn\'t too bad, on the pricey side but the portion is huuuge to me
The first few mouthfuls were quite delicious but the subsequent were not so due to the excess of hae bee. :/
On my first visit to The Coastal Settlement, ordered the Half and Half Pizza at $25 (wagyu and margherite) and a side of portobello fries ($15) to share. The place was beautiful both on the interior and exterior, there weren\'t many others there and something mellow was playing softly in the background. 
The vanilla wasn\'t overpowered by the strong dark chocolate tart and was able to balance out the dish. \n<br />However, the chocolate tart was so dry and stale.

The lovely combi that I would always order but truffle fries here is not the best that I have tried.
I like how the service crew will wait for us to finish our appetisers before dishing out the mains.

E.g. This pizza tasted great but it is not photogenic. Dull colors and not might contrast. \n<br />But we must be creative to take pictures for such tasty yet dull-colored food.
The cheese bonded all the flavors together. \n<br />The pizza tasted very meaty but the base was too thin. It was not able to hold the melted cheese and the juice from the beef.

The scrambled eggs that blanket the two slices of bread are already admirably trufflicious. Smothered in creamed mixed mushrooms, it\'s elevated to an even higher level of decadence. I decided to swop the default Parma ham for smoked salmon as I didn\'t feel like having meat. Not that it made much difference as it\'s not cooked with the eggs. 
With its saturated chocolate flavour and right consistency, the milkshakes here get our vote. Interestingly, we detected little bits of chocolate chips as we slurped. For me, that\'s a good thing because I like it when there\'s a subtle element of surprise in a concoction.
The 180gms piece of Australian grain-fed beef (price: $34++) was a little too fatty. I\'m not referring to the marbled type of fat that I\'d gladly fork out hard earned money for, but the sort that should have been trimmed off before being grilled. Nevertheless, the beef was suitably juicy and cooked to the requested doneness. Just as nice were the scrambled eggs, mesclun salad and truffle fries. I would order this again but I hope to get a fitter cow the next time. So all 180gms of steak is actually edible.
I\'m amazed by the amount of squid, clams and the huge prawns and mussels in this! Such excellent value is uncommon. The beautiful hybrid of East and West flavours is equally impressive. The chef piles on the rocket salad leaves which work superbly with the sauce, and treads very gently with the \"Tom Yam\" element so it never overwhelms. Thus retaining the integrity of the dish\'s concept and not tipping into typical Thai cuisine territory. 
Fully loaded for maximum satisfaction is how I\'d describe the TCS Baked Eggs. Hidden within the depths of the homemade rich, slightly spicy tomato sauce are two eggs, minced beef chuck, chopped beef and pork sausages, and smoked cheddar cheese. The bread however, didn\'t quite match up. 
The red velvet cake itself was not as moist as I hoped it would be but the French vanilla bean ice-cream made up for it. The cubes of beetroot were a great idea as they added a little juiciness. These didn\'t have that deep earthy taste that some find a turn-off.
Can\'t say I like the cup and saucer design (yes, I\'m weird that way), but I did like my cappuccino. It was quite fragrant, a tad milkier than most but still enjoyable. The chill-out ambience of this sprawling cafe made me want return with a book in tow. Not on a weekend of course; it gets too noisy with the crowd.\n
Price is a pretty steep for the amount but the truffle taste is more than sufficiently strong overall. Cutely presented with a truffle mayo dip, the fries here are the straight-cut slimmer sort. I simply could not stop munching on them even when I was feeling stuffed.
The description for the Roast Chicken was too good to be true. The chicken was so dry I thought for a moment I was eating ayam penyet. Disappointing.
The calamari was wonderfully tender and delicious paired with passion fruit and mayo.
This east-sider favourite probably has the best ambience for a relaxed weekend, great for a girls day out or a casual date.
Pandan brioche went so well with the azuki bean amd sweet corn ice cream. The gula melaka sauce too. Really good blend of flavours .. can\'t wait to go back again one day. Popcorn was more like decoration... :p
I have been hearing ravings about this truffle fries. Not too bad but $15? Maybe I\'ll order just this time.
Finally tried out the food at #thecoastalsettlement today. Really liked their beef burger! The portion is huge! In fact i think the portions for everything we ordered was pretty big. Everything else was pretty good but the mushroom soup was wayyy too salty. But i definitely will revisit this place! The thing that annoys me though are the flies when we were seated outdoors. #dinner #sgfood #changi
If casual is key and distance is not a problem, The Coastal Settlement near Changi Village provides a fabulous option for couples looking to wed in a uniquely rustic and quirky setting. With local and Western fare and an array of curios, antiquities and vintage treasures on display, this restaurant will certainly provide a charming backdrop for nostalgic celebrations. 
Includes bacon strips, scrambled eggs, ham, rocket salad, mushrooms and toast
Red velvet cake was smooth and fluffy. Nice combination with cream cheese in its layers, and the scoop of ice cream. The waffle was well-received by my friends, though I would have preferred it to be fluffier, rather than crispy. Overall a great experience at Coastal Settlement.
Generous beef toppings and delightfully crispy crust. The prosciutto half was also cheesy and fresh. Recommended (:
A cup of flat white. Tastes the norm at astronomical prices. $6. 
I can finally finally finally strike off Coastal Settlement from my to-go list! ‚úåÔ∏è Too bad their truffle fries are waaaaaaay tooooo oooooily! But their so potatoey I\'ll eat them anyway! üòÅ
Really good Wagyu beef on a thin crusted pizza. Really yummy. 
This is one of our favourite restaurant hang-outs because of the nostalgic decor, quiet ambience and decent teas &amp; coffee. Our all-time fav dish here is the calamari with zesty pomegranate mayo. We had that of course and it didn\'t disappoint. The creamy and flavourful mushroom soup went perfectly with the toasted slices of baguette. The crispy truffle fries became hard quickly as they cooled down. The prawn toasties were a tad salty but yummy nonetheless. The chicken wings tasted like the usual prawn-paste ones at tze char restaurants. 
Aesthetically pleasing but it was messy getting the salad out! Love the vintage touch and ambience of the place :)
Red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting n berries compote, served with vanilla ice cream n nuts. Fabulous! 
Food is not bad, prices are like eating in the city but the ambience makes up for it 
Overrated for this drink. Doesn\'t taste as good as I thought. 
üëç Best Rosti I\'ve ever eaten. Just that the price is a little too steep 
Rosti Sausage :) best one I\'ve eaten so far. #yum #foodporn
Super ulu and far but pretty places are worth the trip and time 
Seafood in lobster broth - soup was thick with prawn, squid, clams and mussel. The prawns were not v fresh though.... 
Eggs Benedict was tasty and having the runny egg yolk oozing out was the best part of the meal! 
Looks finger-liking goooooood...like I said, looks...well, we thought that it was a tad tough, therefore, I think the cod must have been frozen...for this we give a 3/5. 
This is the item that I enjoyed the most! The creamy level is just nice and it\'s good eaten hot! :) 4/5
This needs to be eaten hot! If it is cold, it becomes a tad oily &amp; salty...hmmm...I think it is so-so...
A bit chewy
Crispy fries with decent amount of truffle oil. 
Sunday #brunch double date with @sikengisgiggs @beautysorority @tohkeith. We missed out on a group pic!

Dessert is a must after every meal. 
And we hearsay that @the_coastal_settlement_ has set up a rather crazy booth chock full of vintage items and memorabilia. Can\'t wait to visit later!
But hold your reservations and trust me; once you place these meaty portobello mushrooms crusted in a sturdy dry crumb and swathed through creamy truffle mayo into your mouth. It\'s a whole new world

The path around the reservoir felt a bit like wet sand (just rained) and was harder to run on than on road. Good change of terrain, though I was complaining quite a bit (sorry boy!). After that, we went to The Coastal Settlement for brunch for the second time.

unfortunately, the dish was nothing like i had imagined. the Macaroni was hard and the sauce didn\'t taste in the least bit cheesy.
