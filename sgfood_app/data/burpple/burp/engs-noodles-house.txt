A bowl of my favorite wanton mee with their tongue burning chili üòÜ
The best possible dish (and person) to come back to after 10 days of knuckle-schnitzel-bratwurst-repeat
As a Hong Konger, my family and I are always on a lookout for the best wanton mee equivalents in Singapore. This is definitely one on the list!
Finally here!!!! Verdict: amazing Char Siew that was not fatty yet so tasty, seasoned almost to perfection! Fresh wantons spotted, but clumpy skin. Noodles slightly oily but along with the signature Chilli sauce tasted good! 
Whenever I visit Eng\'s Noodles House for their \"wantan mee\", I can\'t resist getting a plate of the boiled \"wantans\" too. The dumpling skin is really thin and silky-soft but it is the tasty pork filling that clinches it for me. Good on their own but even better with Eng\'s special crazy-spicy chilli sauce.
Absolutely love their wantons with thin, slippery skins, each filled with a substantial amount of mildly peppery meat! I\'m also happy with the char siew, which were lean but not dry nor tough, and the sauce was tasty without being overly salty. Though the noodles were regrettably thicker than normal (I love my noodles thin!), this definitely ranks amongst the top wanton mees in SG!
Yummy! Love the noodle texture and the fried wanton. They weren\'t kidding how spicy was the chilli.
The sign reads \"BEWARE of super HOT Chili\" and you better believe it. A few drops of the potent chili is enough to burn your tongue. Forget about the Sabx2 or Pontian wanton noodles, this is the real deal. In my opinion, one of the best in the business. 
Don\'t underestimate the chilli. Love the noodle texture! Not the typical skinny noodle.
3 munchies: Thick and springy noodles with a rather generous serving of mediocre char siew. I was disappointed in its signature super hot chilli sauce that tasted one dimensional. 
Craving for some Punggol Nasi Lemak but the queue was way too long, hence Wanton noodles for dinner. Be warned, the chili sauce is really very spicy. 
$5.50. Always a delight with just a tiny bit of the crazy hot chili. 
Waiting for Kok Kee to reopen so this will have to do for now.
I used to have the wonton mee at the hawker centre during my late supper with my family &amp; friends. But when shifted to tanjong katong area the wonton mee no more selling late night. But Let me warn u of their chillies it is super spicy &amp; pls do not add the chillies into your noodles if u can\"t take it it is spicier than È∫ªËæ£. Heard say that the owner handmade the chilli himself. Name:Eng Wonton Noodle. Address:287 Tanjong Katong Road Singapore 437070. Operating Hours:1100-2100hrs Closed on Alternate Monday.
This is the wanton mee place that is famous for their fiery chili sauce (they even put a warning sign on the bottle to proceed with caution). Honestly, the wanton mee here is yummy enough to be eaten without the chili as the noodle is so springy and flavorful, the chili is just a bonus topping for me! 
I grew up with this famous Wonton noodle stall, having had it since i was 7 (and that\'s as far as i can remember), when it was still run by Eng himself at Dunman Food Centre. Years on and the noodles are just as good, but wontons slightly downsized and the chilli no longer pack the same punch (which might actually be a good thing, because 2 drops of the older version were enough to knock me out). I STILL LOVE ENG\'S.
Noodles were springy, decent sized and thickness of char siew. $3 vegetables was a disappointing small portion. The best thing: spicy chili sauce!
Simple but flavourful bowl of noodles. No special sauces but delicious on its own.
After hearing from many friends about this place, I decided to check it out for myself, the noodles were springy, at $5.50 the serving was huge, the wontons were pretty good, we ordered a small plate of boiled wontons at $3.00 and it was a tad too salty. The main highlight of the meal would be the chili sauce, even a small drop of it\'s sauce can set your throat and tongue burning. Overall, the springy noodles and it\'s chili made the whole meal worth it!
One of the better wantan noodles in Singapore with super hot chilli. Loved the noodles texture here.
Conquere yet another hawker master - Eng\'s wanton noodle! Do not ignore the warning on the chilli bottle; the chilli is fiery!! I like their version of noodle compared to the usual thread-like eggy noodles! Fried wanton was really nice too but portion was very small at $4
A 60 year old business, now in the expanse of a dedicated shophouse. The noodles were done al dente and flavor was just right, but I\'ll never understand why this place of wanton noodles doesn\'t have a soya sauce base. The small option is priced at $4.50.
Finally tried the \"super spicy chilli sauce\" wanton mee. #suaku #notmytypeofWTM
Eng\'s wanton mee with @dopeysylly family üòÅüòÅüòÅ. I think his house is like my second home already haha. Anyway, this is damm nice so do try! Better than feifei i think!
Try Eng\'s Wantan noodles, @guitarzero07 \'s favorite along with the \'super hot\' chili.  Honest opinion compared to Fei Fei and Kok Kee as follows:-\n<br />1) most value for money amongst the 3 2) I prefer Kok Kee\'s sauce 3) I prefer Fei Fei\'s noodle texture 4) Eng\'s wontons are probably the best 5) the chili ain\'t as spicy as ppl make it out to be.  Could be a function of my increased threshold for spiciness.
His wanton noodles has won several awards, including the prestigious Hawker Masters at the Asian Masters in 2011. Here\'s a photo of Eng\'s noodle. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/engs-noodles-house/
Finally tried this popular wanton mee at Katong! Certainly deserves all the raves cos its so yummy! #food #foodporn #noodles
Went for a first try, it does not really hit you till the 5th mouthful, which by then I have double up the chilli. When you sip the soup, it somehow intensify the hotness from the heat of the soup. Left w a swollen lip, but thoroughly enjoyed it, will be back for my next spicy craving!
New wanton mee place to go to @sarahlimss! Kicks Fei Fei\'s non-springy noodles ass!
Slightly too oily but the wanton is damn flavourful and the noodles very qq!! Add the chili for extra extra kick! \n<br />#engsnoodlehouse #wantonmee #katong #singapore #food #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgeats #jiaklocal #sgfoodie #whati8today #onthetable #tslmakan #burpple #burpplesg

Wanton noodles, fried wanton and of course veges!\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Springy noodles. Fatless charsiew and juicy wantons. Nice but could do with less sodium. Chilli sauce well known to be super spicy and it did not disappoint.

A lot of talk about its chilli which is brutally spicy, but even without, it\'s damn good too.. it\'s texture and taste kinda reminds me of \'kolo mee\' which are springy and QQ plus the supporting ingredients like char siew and wantons are decent on their own too. And Yes! Add the chili for the kick as it will reward you with dopamine and endorphin release from your brain!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#engswantonmee#wantonnoodles#wantonmee#engsnoodlehouse#spicy#qq#noodles#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
üòçSuper springy egg noodles with small yummy wontons! Can\'t find them? It\'s hidden under the noodles to let them soak up the special delicious sauce below not found anywhere else! As harmless as the chilli may look, the note on it is Real! It\'s fiery and super shiok! üòµ No wonder there\'s still a queue at 2pm.

Took the first mouth without the infamous chilli... and it was good! Noodles were springy and QQ. It\'s full of flavour and was enhanced by the aromatic sesame oil! I love it. Next is to \'test\' the chilli..Wow! This is really cold blooded, \'in your face\' burning chilli.. i dab a few rounds to my noodles for some kick but with the noodles being so fragrant, there isn\'t really a need to do thatüò¨\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#engswantonmee#wantonnoodles#wantonmee#engsnoodlehouse#spicy#qq#noodles#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Eng\'s noodles were on the chewy side and their char siew the local traditional type. The key to enjoying it had to be their \"Super hot chilli\" that made the noodles so tasty and shiok. Top up their deep fried Wanton to make the meal more complete with a crispy bite. So simple yet so good. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #burpproved #wantonmee
I had high expectations of this due to a close friend always going there and tempting me with the thought of it. It lives up to expectations. 
Pretty good wanton Mee!! The fried wantons are so yummy! üëåüòòüçú #wantonmee #melfclar #Katong #engsnoodlehouse #noodles #wanton #throwback
Missed the crispy fried lard though wonder why they removed that. Chilli is extra hot just a small squirt for a start  please \n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodies #yummy #sg #burpple #burpplesg #lunch #wantonmee #engsnoodle
Wanton mee at its best. Their chilli was really ‚ô®!! #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #takemymoney #mybossiscoolerthanyours
Big size for $5.5 plus $3 fried wanton.\n<br />Even without the super spicy chilli, it packs lots of flavour from the pork oil. .\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #whatiate #wantonmee #wantonmeesg #engsnoodlehouse #wantonnoodle #burpple #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodblog #noodle #igsg #igsgfoodie #hungrygowhere #stfood #opensnapsg #openricesg
Taste is really subjective I would say. Eat this wonton noodles plain and it\'s just plain &amp; mediocre, its the chilli here which gives it the oomph factor! The fried wontons are good though! 1 more plate please! üòãüòã\n<br />.\n<br />#engsnoodlehouse #burpple #brunch #eatoutsg #exploresg #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodspotting #foodporn #foodsg #hawkerfood #igsgfood #instadaily #instafood #instagramhub #jiaklocal #latergram #nomnnomnom #potd #sgfg #sghawker #sgfood #tslmakan #tanjongkatong #vscosg #vscofood
