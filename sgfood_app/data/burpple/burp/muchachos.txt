Great Mexican food! Generous portions were given and the side of guacamole made it even tastier!
In love with this huge messy wrap, that is filled lovely with pulled pork that is seasoned well. Generous with their fillings, of cheese and salsa , that you simply just have to get down and dirty with this exploding quesadilla. Use your hands, and don\'t bother with the plastic utensils, for they are just completely useless. Add another $2 for guacamole, and it will send you up to heaven. Have their house watermelon, which I suggest bringing your own vodka, or rum to spice the drink up, to make that perfect tropical drink. Or order their Mexican beer, and finished the meal with their national hat dance, Jarabe for sure as hell, you will simmer your shoulders out of their lovely joint! 
Cause it\'s that huge and sexy. Stuffed full with rice, beans, salsa, and a choice of protein, I couldn\'t get through half of it! At S$12-15 it\'s very worth the buck compared to the usual less generous caf√© fare. 
Pork butt cooked on its own lard?!?! How sinful can that be? The burritos were delicious and goes well with Mexican coke
nestled along keong saik road, muchachos serves decent and affordable burritos and quesadillas.
My favorite is this chicken quesadilla! Very crispy skin and packed with so much ingredients and flavor! SUPER YUMZZZ! üòç
Been wanting to satisfy my Chipotle craving. My life is now complete.
Love the hot salsa, fresh tomatoes, and Mexican rice~ generous portion! However, can hardly taste the cheese, shall remove it next time. Ordered without sour cream tooüòã
Basically a BRILLIANT, 5-kilo, pork and lard-stuffed burrito. Pretty amazed by the rows of hidden Chinatown gems with a couple of other weirdosüî´
And hipster lights. Haha. Pretty worth it, reminds me of Chipotle
Authentic San Francisco Mission District-style burrito.  Even the hot sauces are the Mexican real-deals.  
What went into my burrito - pulled pork, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, rice and refried beans. So huge I was struggling to finish even half of the 10\" burrito. #burrito #texmex #sgfood #pulledpork #carnitas #salsa #foodporn
The spice level isn‚Äôt tough to handle. The fish is a whole battered fish within the ‚Äúprata‚Äù , worth for those who wanna get Mexican cravings done~ \n<br />#sgfood #burpple #foodiesg #sgfoodies #mexicansg #muchacho #foodinstagram #foodblogsg #foodislife #foodhuntsg

Perfect for a group setting and you can literally snack on these all day long while downing bottles of beer or cups of margaritas.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Muchachos\n<br />Address: 22, Keong Siak Road, Singapore 089129\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #muchachos #muchachossg
It\'s like having your Big Mac Meal all at the same time. Yum steak and fries. #burpple #steakandfries #muchachos #eeeeeats #foodporn #foodphotography
I quote, \"they remind me more of chapatti\". Haha. This is nice place to checkout if you\'re looking for a quick meal. I recommend the quesadilla ($10.50) or burrito versions ($12) if you have a bigger appetite (both are fairly large with a generous amount of fillings). P.S. pardon the poor lighting, the interior is quite dimly lit. ü•ô
Cosy place for some Mexican food. Chicken Quesadillas with Guacamole at $12.50. Breakfast burrito is a tad too oily for my liking. Super Nachos $13.50 not too bad. Better to share with friends. #BurppleXChope
Interesting Mexican fast food joint down at keong saik street
Love it. üëçüèª [$12] #howtonotbefat #burpple #muchachos
It comprised of grilled beef, tomatoes, cabbage etc, and was gigantic in portion. The beef was succulent and was well-complemented by the crisp, fresh goodness of the vegetables.
Unfortunately the tortilla chips were not crispy- even those untouched by the ground beef and sauce. The sauce and ground beef were average, nothing that would leave a deep impression.

Still the best value place to get a decent burrito in Singapore. \n<br />#burpple

Muchachos offers a different perspective to burritos. Much like the big sandwich joint, can get to choose from a few selection of carbs, proteins, sauces and the staff with wrap for you. Most importantly, it don\'t cost a lot, like the other Mexican food out there.
