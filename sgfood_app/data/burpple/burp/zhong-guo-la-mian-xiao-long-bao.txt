Hands down on of the best Spicy Chilli Wantons I\'ve had! Ten silky smooth wantons drowning in a szechuan sour sauce for only $4.50?! Located just across from the famous Michelin soya sauce chicken in Chinatown, these will go perfectly as a side dish, or as a main for any occasion.
The noodles was pretty normal but go for their pan fried dumplings which was crispy and juicy. The Szechuan dumplings (10 for $4.50)  were beautifully wrapped. It wasn\'t too spicy or too vinegary as well. Super silky with a nice balance of the crunchy prawns and soft meat filling.
After reading about this cheap yet affordable food option on Burpple, I\'ve been wanting to try it. A few weeks back on a Monday, my friend and I headed there wanting to try it out! To our disappointment, it was closed!!! 😫 I asked around and found out that they are closed on Mondays! So people, don\'t go on a Monday! 
Thanks to @burpple\'s Cheap and Good Meals under $10, I found myself wandering along the rather large Hawker Centre in Chinatown Complex (yes the very same one with the Michelin One Star Soy Sauce Chicken, this stall is rather near, by the way) looking for unit 02-135. Undistracted by temptation, I was rewarded with 10 beautifully wrapped 紅油抄手 (Sze Chuan Chili Dumpling - $4.50!!). Everything was oh so perfect on this plate, the heat and sourness from the vinegar and spice, the silkiest wanton wrapping and the well-balanced bounciness of the prawn and meat filling. The only flaw? I wish I could have 10 or 100 more of these babies 🐷 \n<br />This currently ranks number one in my ❤️now (sorry Auntie and Uncle from 936 LTN), watch this space while I unearth more yummy dumplings!
This stall at Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre owns the title as the most pocket-friendly Xiao Long Bao stall amongst our Burpple community! Come with your colleagues after work and order a few sets of Xiao Long Bao ($5.50 for 10). As you wait, grab a seat nearby to watch them work their magic as they knead, stuff and fold the soup dumplings like clockwork. The translucent thin-as-paper dumpling skin traps hot soup inside, so don\'t be too eager to pop them right into your mouth. Another must-order is the Hong You Chao Shou ($4.50 for 10) that Burpple Tastemaker Michelle Kayla Tey strongly endorses —  velvety smooth pork and prawn dumplings doused in a piquant reservoir of red chili oil and black vinegar!\n<br />Avg price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Peter Wong
.\n<br />Was exploring Chinatown and stumbled upon a stall selling \'xiao long bao\'. Upon observing a little on how the \'shifu\' swiftly knead the xlb then send to steam a-la minute, my instinct tells me that this is definitely some quality xlb.\n<br />.\n<br />True enough. The skin of the xlb is as thin as paper, which encapsulate the flavourful pork fillings that squirt juices upon a harmless bite.\n<br />.\n<br />I\'m sold.
10 pcs for 5.50. Great value for decent quality xiao long bao.
Totally craving for these velvety thin parcels (thick and floury ones are such a turn-off for me) encasing fresh pork and prawns with a hint of pepper, doused in a piquant reservoir of red chili oil and black vinegar now. It also doesn\'t hurt that it\'s incredibly affordable, at only $4.50 for 10 ping pong-sized dumplings.
S$5.50 for 10 xiaolongbaos which tastes so good that you\'ll wonder why you paid double the price at restaurants. These juicy soup dumplings are made-to-order and have a more homely taste - no frills or 18 folds but soup is not too oily!
I stumbled over this place a few years back and have returned regularly ever since and also brought all my visitors here to trt. I love their spicy Dan Dan Mian as well as their awesome Zhajiangman with handmade noodles. On the dumpling side the Xiao Long Bao and Spicy Wonton are incredible and all that for close to nothing. Ps: they have also have a second stall now at Alexandra Food Center (??) close to all the motorbike repair shops.
One dumpling with two different texture. What else could I asked for? \n<br />Very hard to plate on a bowl plate. 😅😅😅 Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao 中国拉面小笼包\n<br />Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre, 335 Smith St #02-135 s050335 (Chinatown)\n<br />Sunday to Mondy: 1100 - 2100 \n<br />Closed on Tuesday
The workmanship wasn\'t great but tasted good. Always prepared a spoon at the bottom to catch the piping hot juice (try not to use the hand) 😁😁😁 They handmade every XLB, then froze it till someone put an order. Steamed it for 7 minutes and the XLB was ready. \n<br />10pcs for S$5. Great Price. Quick Service. \n<br />Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao 中国拉面小笼包\n<br />Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre, 335 Smith St #02-135 s050335 (Chinatown)\n<br />Sunday to Mondy: 1100 - 2100 \n<br />Closed on Tuesday
[#02-135] 中国拉面小笼包\n<br />oily, but SLURP you\'ll go, it\'s super shiok!! at just $4.50! even more awesomeness if you\'re one who loves vinegar 😋
Why would I not love it..:) The stall also serves many other Chinese dishes such as Fried/Steamed dumpling 10pcs at $5.0, Spicy Wanton at $4.0, various kinds of noodles from $3.5 to 5.0. The auntie who takes order was very friendly. I arrived around 5.20pm to beat the dinner crowd, and luckily I only waited like 10 minutes even it was a Saturday night. People seem to gather for the queue around 5.40pm and it never got shorter than 15 people, so be prepared to wait!\n<br />I had Sichuan Spicy Noodle ($4.0) along with my Xiao Long Bao, and the portion of the noodle was so generous that I couldn\'t almost breath after finishing the XLB and noodle! The noodle was springy and soup was nicely cooked with minced meat, peanuts and spring onions. It wasn\'t that spicy though. I should say it was a bit more sour than I thought. Next time I\'d like to try Spicy Wanton!\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #singaporefood #xiaolongbao #chinatown #singaporefoodie #burpple #burppleSG #lifeislalala #싱가포르맛집
Shortly after, they are being drained before joining forces with the chilli oil and sichuan mala spices. Scallions and coriander leaves were added to give colour and an additional dimension to the flavours.\n<br />•\n<br />At only $4.50 for 10 of these 红油抄手, it is almost a steal and should be in the list of anyone who loves Chinese food. Be note that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so do not go there during their off days.\n<br />•\n<br />Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao 中国拉面小笼包\n<br />Address: 335, Smith Street, Chinatown Complex Market &amp; Food Centre, Unit 02-135, Singapore 089152\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock
A thin skin with juicy meat that pairs perfectly with black vinegar. Some may find that there isn\'t enough soup in the dumpling, but for 60cents/piece, I\'ve got zero complaints. 👍🏻 #igfood #igeats #foodislove #hungrygowhere #burpple #burppleSG #sgfood #sgeats #igsgfood #igsgeats #eatoutsg #singapore #yummy #honestreviews #hawkerfinds #ilovechinesefood #xiaolongbao #dumplings
