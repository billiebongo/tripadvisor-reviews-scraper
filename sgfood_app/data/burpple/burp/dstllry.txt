#nofilter . This is not for the faint hearted. Perhaps one of the most awesome bouillabaisse I have had. The richness is orgasmic. #burpple #burpplesg
It had a lot going in the plate. The lobster was absolutely stunning. The price will stun you (in a nice way) too. Fresh ingredients and well put together. Almost a seafood wet dream. #burpplesg #burpple @fokwaileng wish you were here ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Having a Nikka Coffey whisky as an ingredient always agrees with me. Furthermore, the way @ai_igarashi poured had the froth rising like a souffl√©! Quite a stunning sight. #ÊØèÂ§©happyhour #japanesecocktails #burpple #burpplesg #nikkacoffeymalt
The salmon belly was rather over-torched and thus, slightly dry, but perhaps it\'s just because of the current weather that reduced the ratio of fats in the salmon belly. But I believe it\'s just an off day and would give them the benefit of doubt. Other than that, this lunch set is really lovely. Surprisingly, I love the bara chirashi (spicy) noodle whose marination was on point. Though not spicy, the bowl offers a rich flavour of fresh sashimi topped generously with ikura. Definitely a place I would go back to for their lunch set.
|\n<br />Great place for a quality bowl of Don. The sweet uni gravy been soaked up by the Japanese rice. The touch of roasted sesame created the great contrast in flavor and texture. Great eat.
Not as salty as teppei, they used warm Japanese rice instead of sushi rice. Nice and generous chunky sashimi. Freshly grated wasabi. Gigantic explosive ikuras. This is going in the books. \n<br />#willbeback #burpple #valueformoney #barachirashi
GRRR. But anyway, I was elated when I saw Barachirashi Spicy Ramen ($16.90), because this is an ingenious idea to break away from the usual Don option. YAY, because I always prefer noodles to rice. The lunch set also includes an appetizer, soup and iced green tea.\n<br />Don‚Äôt worry about the word ‚Äòspicy‚Äô, because the level of spiciness is really mild.\n<br />The chewy and QQ ramen was doused with chunks of Maguro, Salmon and Hamachi marinated in their homemade sauce and then sprinkled with ikura, sesame and seaweed. TAKE MY MONEY. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Tastes much better than it looks. Tis the season to be pampering yourself. \n<br />#dstllry #burpple
Enough said. Though it has a smaller variety of seafood than the version from Teppei, the seasoning is definitely more palatable than the overly salty \'sauce\' they use at Teppei. \n<br />#dstllry #burpple
I only recently found out about this place at Media Circle and was pleasantly surprised that although it was pretty secluded, the restaurant/ bar was packed! There\'s really nothing much to complain about the food, the Unagi don was done nicely and being a fan of fried chicken, the succulent chicken Karaage in salted egg yolk dip was just lovely! Goes great with drinks as well.
We were recommended by the waiter to try the lotus roots chips and while it was a little pricey for lotus roots, the dish was executed very well. Paper thin slices of fried lotus root chips, served with truffled mayo, this dish is addictive! The Bara Chirashi Don was also lovely with generous chunks of sashimi. 
This is the best bowl of salmon don I have ever tried. No joke.
Very generous portion, tasty, not as seasoned/salty as Teppei. But go during the lunch service and not at the end of it because they have this weird if-I-run-out-of-something-it\'s-fine-and-I-hope-you-never-find-out service. And if you\'re not full from it, you can get the delicious Banana cake from Revolution Coffee next door. (Rating:üò¨)
Bara Chirashi bowl for lunch! Generous serving with loads of fresh sashimi chunks. Served during lunch hours only. $16.
DSTLLRY is definitely not what you would consider a traditional Japanese restaurant, but don\'t underestimate the quality of their food. In particular, their lunchtime dons (rice bowls) seem to be irresistible. The chunks of plump and fresh salmon, maguro and hamachi are tossed in a special mix of mirin, dashi and soy sauce, making their Barachirashi Don ($16.90), quite simply, to-die-for. What\'s unique is that you can opt not only for a salad instead of rice for your Barachirashi, but also a Barachirashi Spicy Ramen, if you\'re not a chirashi purist, that is. The only catch? This dark, sexy bar and art gallery is kinda hidden in the depths of Portsdown, so please keep this chirashi in mind should you be in the area during lunch! 
The A4 grade Wagyu beef was tenderness through and through, while the ikura was extremely fresh. I have seen many soft-boiled eggs in my time but this one was especially beautiful. Admittedly, this wasn\'t the biggest of portions. However, with the appetiser of crunchy roasted soya beans, clear vegetable broth and a glass of cold green tea, it was enough for lunch.\n
Once inside the safe embrace of your mouthly cavern, the seared salmon slices seem to disintegrate into distinct layers ‚Äì an external fatty and oily layer instantly disengages from the virtually liquid core of supple salmon flesh, which itself almost immediately melts on your tongue in manner of evaporation. Special mention should also be given to the wickedly fresh wasabi (up your nose, it goes) and the roasty sesame bits which make the already exciting proceedings even more glorious. A slightly dry and unevenly marinated rice results in points deducted, but at this stage its status as a flaw is akin to that of a mole on Emma Watson‚Äôs scalp. 4.5/5
Gotten the oddest item off the Lunch Menu - the Barachirashi Spicy Ramen ($16.90, yes you did not see wrongly)  Plump thick cubes of Salmon, Maguro and Hamachi tossed in their sauce have an unique texture (in a good way) that\'s super likable like the new friendly boy that smiles at you in a cute way which you will definitely like from the first biteTheir spicy ramen was not so impressive and could be alittle more spicier. 
Like an ex lover, I cannot get over this bowl of aburi salmon and Japanese rice. Not over torched, not under torched. This is the perfect lunch! Perhaps a side of sashimi would make it even more amazing than it already is. Need I mention their chilling ambience with acoustic covers of mainstream music?
Gallery, sound-space, bar and omakase restaurant all rolled into one, DSTLLRY is the brainchild of music producer and photographer Andrew Lum. While the 10-course omakase menus here are fairly reasonably-priced at $99, you can fork out a fraction of that to savour their delectable dons instead. Pop in for lunch (noon to 3pm) and enjoy quality donburi options like Salmon Belly Don ($16.90), Miyazaki A4 Wagyu Don ($34.90), and Barachirashi Don or Salad ($16.90). Since you\'ll be sitting right at the bar anyway, how about a ordering a bespoke cocktail for a cheeky mid day pick-me-up? We won\'t tell.
Like a sultry, sexy graduate from the Teppei Syokudo school of marinated bara chirashi who deftly avoids all the saltiness pitfalls of its contemporaries and keeps things really tight and fresh. Oooh la la. 4.3/5 
After trying about 15-20 different kinds of Chirashi in Singapore, this has definitely gotta be my second favourite. This is so fresh, I thought the fish were alive, alright lame.
Currently my favourite Don so far! Despite its slightly small portions, this is really one of the few Don that I don\'t mind paying for its high quality and taste. Rice was plump and sticky but without clumping in a huge lump, and the soy sauce was not only savoury but also carried an umami flavour that simply made this Don really unique from the lot I had tried. Salmon belly is flame-seared with a blowtorch; you could taste that fresh smokiness with every slurp. Mix in the potent wasabi to get a heated numbing sensation that makes you dumbfounded yet wanting for more. Despite its relatively ulu location, this would be a spot I would revisit soon due to their good food and super chill environment being a sound space and art gallery at the same time too.
Miyazaki A4 Wagyu Don with 63.5 deg C Tamago and Ikura on Uonuma Koshihikari Rice - $38 nett
As starters, this set of tapas for two sets a good base to prepare for the coming dishes. I really liked the potato and the fragrant crispy skin combination hiding a small piece of smoked unagi underneath while the amaebi tartar topped with red pepper puree spiced things up a little. These mini bites packs a flavors leaving you to anticipate the coming dishes being prepared in front of you. Finally to top it off, a shot of lobster pur√©e to warm you a little just before the next dish is served.
Not for the faint hearted and suitable for those who needs a strong one every time. #ÊØèÂ§©happyhour #fujifilmxe1 #fujinon18mm #burpple #burpplesg

Their Chirashi Don is the bomb, and on that\'s value for money.
First time having such QQ noodles(better than the don) with chunks of sashimi, ikura and nori strips. Food and ambience just got even better
Eating in the dark is another new experience. #food#foodporn#burpple#japanese#foodie#Singapore#instafood_sg\n<br />#foodstagram#instafood#chirashi
The interesting feature of the dish is that the top layer is chilled while the rice below is piping hot.
The smoked wagyu beef is tender and succulent and dipping it in the tangy mustard sauce diminishes the saltiness of the dried meat. \n<br />A tantalizing appetizer to start the night with.
A stimulating appetiser to savour before proceeding to the mains
Teppei\'s version is slightly saltier as compared to Dstllry\'s but they are more generous with the varieties and servings of sashimi. There will be avid supporters for both camps
Dayum.... || {Aburi Salmon Don} at @DSTLLRYco - always reliable. that Japanese sweet potato mash on the side tho„ÄÇ

I had the Bara-chirashi salad for only $18 nett. Looks like this is another place to get my sashimi fix besides Teppei/Hana Hana. Somehow sashimi cubes or chunks works for me more than just slices. üôä The lunch menu comes with a side dish, soup and iced green tea. Omakase meals(dinner only) are priced at $95 onwards, with cocktail prices range between $26-$28. Finally something DIFFERENT to look forward to at Portsdown!
