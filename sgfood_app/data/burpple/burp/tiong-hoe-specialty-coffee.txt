But very nice coffee culture feel to it as according to Tokyo @iamcyrix.\n<br />#burpple #tionghoespecialtycoffee #hiddencafe #stirlingroad #queenways
50+ years of coffee experiences, roasting their own beans.. Acidity and medium body.. Aroma is just too awesome.. Their coffee not for sales, tipping basis..
