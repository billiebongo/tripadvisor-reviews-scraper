Almost ended up late for school but this is really worth the rush. Garlic Cheese is nothing new to me now given I have had the same thing in the past, but each time I order it whenever I am here I am just so intrigued by the stretchy cheese and that garlicky stench which runs through the paper-thin, crisp prata that has a little tension to pull; totally my thing for I just love strong tasting, pungent prata apart from plain ones (eg. garlic/onion prata). That being said, it is hard not to order the plain one here too; same crispness in the outside but dense enough within for the pulling tension. And not forgetting the curry; not too spicy, but thick enough and flavourful that you would definitely wipe out no matter the portion they serve to you.
This time, because I\'m hungry, because I just drove 10 km to pick up my brother, and because I\'m tied up with file check, that I decide I need the ultimate murtabak.
Springleaf Prata Place is known for their innovative dishes at the yearly Hawkerfest, from the Murtabak Burger to the Plaster Blaster. This is one of their creative fusion dishes, where char kuay teow or Mee Goreng meets Prata. Pretty much akin to have a pretty saucey and savoury plate of well-fried Mee Goreng, but fried along with the usual plus Prata bits which makes it rather unique. Pretty interesting especially for those who love both Prata and Mee Goreng, but torn on deciding on which to go for here.
fusion, you either make or break it. but i say this is one bloody fusion done right! plaster blaster - essentially your usual perfect poached egg at hipster cafe but comes with indian spiced hollandaise sauce on your regular prata. and it worked divinely! my only grip was that my prata centre was tad soggy from the thousand island sauce beneath the ham. i say keep the prata crisp and dry so we can savor the prata thoroughly. no matter, enjoyed my plaster blaster so much the satisfaction lasted till i skip lunch totally. westies please rejoice now because springleaf prata place now serving you at bukit timah railmall! thanks @the_xw for spotting it!
Stoked that Springleaf Prata Place had opened their third outlet at The Rail Mall along Upper Bukit Timah (replacing Gangnam Style Korean BBQ) which is definitely more accessible for me. Had the plain which was crisp yet had a bit of tension on the inside to pull; a good balance of textures and the garlic was crisp and pungent. Definitely would come back for my Prata fix, especially if I am craving for the Plaster Blaster since it\'s so near!
Definitely innovative but not to my likings. The combination of hollandaise sauce and prata, makes it too jerlat. Super filing after just this one prata combi. I would still prefer my eggs ben on a muffin, light and toasted. Nonetheless, good effort for this creation! #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #burpple #burpplesg #burpplefood #prata #sgpratahouse #sginnovativecooking #eggsbenprata #plasterblasterprata #feedmefood2017

.\n<br />.\n<br />This roti prata chain serves a large variety of pratas, they also come up with super innovative ones. Been here a few times already, absolutely enjoyed my time there. The kosong prata fried to that golden brown colour was super crispy, dipped the prata into the sardine curry and it\'s a perfect combo👍👍 The sardine curry doesn\'t have that fishy smell and taste, so it was extremely pleasant. Egg prata was huge, I went to other prata places and was amazed by the size of the egg prata in Springleaf. It was delightful to munch on as you could taste the fried egg with the fresh prata👌👌 Definitely recommending this prata place to you guys if you haven\'t tried yet.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodporn #foodphotography #foodadventure #singapore #singaporefood #sgeats #whati8today #8dayseat #getinmybelly #yumminess #exploresingapore #eeeeeats #igsg #instafood_sg #instafoodie #sgfoodblogger #instasg #burpple #burpplesg #prata #indiancuisine #eatoutsg #foodgasm #sgfoodhunt #sgfooddiary

I Super love the cheese and the crisp Prata!! Just that its abit too gelak
I like how #springleafprataplace at #railmall also has their pratas not too oily (as compared to other locations). That being said, the pratas are still really filling. Attempt not to over order (and fail terribly because everything sounds so good).\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#throwback #food #foodstagram #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodgasm #foodspotting #instafood #instagood #instagramers #yummy #amazing #iphonesia #lefooding @lefooding #picoftheday #photooftheday #igdaily #sgeats #sgfood #whati8today #iweeklyfood #eatoutsg #burpple

Shall try the ultimate murtabak next time #burpple
😋
Umami to the max! 😋
This is the Plaster Blaster which was created for Ultimate Hawker Festive 2014. It comes with crispy prata, chicken ham and poached egg. However they have changed the Indian spiced hollandaise sauce to the norm buttery, creamy hollandaise which I thought the former has more characteristic of its own. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #prata #railmall #springleafprataplacd
It\'s less than 10 mins drive away from home! Even shorter from work! 😱 I really need to work on self control right now.
