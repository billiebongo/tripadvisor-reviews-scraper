I prefer some wetness in it and they do a pretty decent job! #namsing #oldairport #hawker #hawkerfood #hawkerpedia #hokkienmee #friedprawnnoodles
You need both luck and patient (waited almost an hour for it) to savor this plate of hokkien mee. My dear friend tried to patronize this stall twice, but it was closed on both occasions heh.

The few times that I was there, it was either closed for the day or have yet to open for business. Helmed by the very one chef, who is easily recognizable from his big and clear goggles that he wears while frying, he is the quality control and master behind this plate of hokkien mee. Nam Sing has been one of my top few choices because of the umami stock, fresh seafood and wok hei in the noodles. As you start eating, beware of the surrounding watchful eyes as you will tend to slurp everything up in a jiffy.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link
