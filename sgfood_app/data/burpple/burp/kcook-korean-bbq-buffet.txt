This Korean BBQ restaurant took over Sarang at Orchard Central and is value for money! Happy weekend everyone :)
The Korean buffet here might well be the most affordable buffet we\'ve seen in a while. At only $14.90++ for lunch on weekdays and $24.90++ for dinner, K.COOK makes a great place for dining in groups and eating till you drop without burning a hole in your pocket. With great value and a good selection, they\'re really bringing in the crowds - so be prepared to queue!
Super crowded on the weekends. Queue for almost 2hours. But it totally worth it! The food is delicious and the staffs is super friendly.
