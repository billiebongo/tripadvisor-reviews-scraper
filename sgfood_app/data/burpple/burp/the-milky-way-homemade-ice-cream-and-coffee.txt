The taste of the waffle is great. I love their ice cream. 
Waffles served with homemade ice cream that are unique and yummy 
This is proof that former Campus Superstar participant Renfred Ng is not just a singer, but a skilled barista too. Flat White is not part of the menu here, but he would be glad to serve you one if you ask. It\'s light-bodied and nutty, and the creaminess was well-balanced. Great for a soothing cup or coffee in the lazy afternoon!
An interesting addition to the Tanglin Halt neighborhood, The Milky Way looks like any ice-cream parlour until you get greeted by former Campus Superstar participant Renfred Ng, who owns this ice-cream parlour. Expect quality ice-cream here as the homemade ice-cream is churned in-house, with premium ingredients used for each flavour. Waffles are also available here, and the buttery fragrance is just delightful. Never miss the coffee here though; pulled by Renfred Ng himself, this is where he will change your impressions that he is not just a good-looking dude who only knows how to sing!
Tried a couple of flavours but I found a liking for the Sicilian Pistachio, which is made from Pistachios imported from Sicily. Ice-cream was smooth, creamy and nutty and lacked an overly heavy taste of dairy not was too sweet. Classic waffles are served here in half portions, which is filled with buttery fragrance with a fluffy interior. Slightly pricey as the waffles come at $5.00 and the ice-cream is an add on at $3.80 for regular flavours and $4.50 for premium flavours. Opt for the Berry Compote at $4.00 extra if you prefer waffles with a fruity touch.
The coffee blends here come from School of Coffee, a collaboration between Singapore Polytechnic and the KaffeeKultur Group. The Flat White ($4.50) is well-balanced with a strong taste.
The owner Renfred Ng was the male runner-up of Singapore‚Äôs first Campus Superstar Ê†°Âõ≠SuperStar in 2006. If you\'re dropping by, don\'t forget to visit @2loaves as well for some delectable bakes.
Love the cheesy (duh?!) ice cream with biscuits bits and strawberry on the crisp yet fluffy waffles! \n<br />Gastronometer: 8.5/10
This is another of our favs, the exquisite homemade ice creams of Milky Way, and their cheeky and wonderfully tasting Smurf ice cream :)\n<br />#smurf #icecream #milkywaysg #sgfood #food #foodporn #revisiting #burrple
Hehehe.. Passionfruit sorbet anybody? New flavour wor
Smurf coloured ice cream but the taste is so surprisingly unexpected of toffee and caramel that it jus screws my mind upside down and inside out! The blue colouring is all natural from blue pea flower :)\n<br />#smurf #icecream #dessert #milkywaysg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodbunnies #food #foodporn #foodstagram #burrple #bluepeaflower
