How do I start? Nostalgia to the max. Have you had this when you were a kid?
My first time at the Benjamins! Instagram worthy over the top milkshake but can\'t afford to go regularly with Milkshakes close to $20 per mug
At close to $20 each, these milkshakes are a force to reckon with. Both of these came under the \"cereal\" range and were absolutely totally delicious to the last drop! The OTT ingredients were well planned and just made them even better. The only question I ask myself now is: when can I go back? 
Went to try this cafe at the not so well known shopping mall, the Forum. Actually had the US Pork Chop before this and it was tender topped with the sweet potato mash! This nutella cake dessert was really good too! They served a big slice which was also wonderful yayy
From the same folks who brought you the Over-The-Top Milkshake, here comes the Captain\'s Crunch Peanut Butter. The Cerealsly Crunchy Shakes are inspired by 6 flavours of breakfast cereals. You gotta try them all Cerealsly!\n<br />.\n<br />Starting your day with desserts as breakfast? Legit now.
•\n<br />Featuring Cerealsly Crunchy Cookie Crisps Shake ($16), one of the six flavours. Good for sharing with a friend or two. Try Captain Nutty CCS if you are a fan of peanut butter! I like the peanut butter crunch cereal puffs. Very addictive.
Crisp, crunchy fries (just the way I like them) topped with heart-stopping spicy, coconutty rendang gravy chock full of minced beef. Ooey cheese and eye-popping sour cream. This hearty bowl is just the cure for a lazy, sad afternoon.  
Milkshake topped with red velvet cake ,white chocolate and lotus biscuits. Love it. 
Sweetness overload~ recommend to share it with someone. It\'s beautiful decorated and everything is just so sweet. Still can try it for experience.
The lobster roll is good but the grilled lobster at the side is kind of dry. 
.
Tim Tam was good. Velvet cake was good. Everything was good in this Strawberry Cheesecake Shake. They never disappoint on their milkshakes. :)
The lobster roll is the star, and we felt there were too many \"bingsu\" dishes (plus milo dessert wasn\'t good). Added a Nutella banana cake shake for our birthday girl @shuperduperrr have a blast tomorrow!! #burpple

not another fusion mumbojumbo...! This was the first response when I saw the soon-to-be-launched 5-course degustation dinner menu at The Benjamins today.
.
And you could choose 1 of these rolls in a degustation set! I would go for the lobsterrrrrrr rolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll! 🙋🏻\n<br />From 18April, @thebenjamins.sg will be rollinggg out a 5-course dinner menu at only $35++ from Sun-Thurs 6-9pm whih includes:\n<br />1) Chef\'s Starter-of-the-Day\n<br />2) Choice of Risotto in tasting portion *(Mushroom/Chilli crab/Squid-ink)\n<br />3) Watermelon Lychee Shooter\n<br />4) A choice of roll *(Lobster/Seafood Okonomiyaki/Chilli Crab/Butter Chicken) \n<br />5) Dessert of the day
So happy! 😊 What a yummy combination of drink and dessert! This comes with a huge chunk of brownie and a stack of assorted Tim Tams.
Caramel Banana OTT Shake 🍌 ($16, featured here) and Chocolate Brownie 🍫 ($16). The banana milkshake is really thick and the Tokyo Banana on top is the icing on the cake! 😆
Lobster Roll ($28) Creative presentation 💯💯, except it didn\'t taste like it looks. One thing we felt unsatisfactory was the meat that\'s harder than usual, otherwise it would\'ve been perfect!
Over the top Coffee Avocado Milkshake ($16) Sinful milkshake indulgence topped with alternating layers of biscuits, avocado and coffee cake, completed with a dash of whipped cream and chocolate wafer sticks.
How I wished I could have this refreshing watermelon lychee smoothie now 😍 •
the Benjamin\'s is all about Insta-worthy food and drinks! Not only must the food be tasty, how it looks like matter a lot too!\n<br />this decadent rainbow cake ($11) is not only visually stunning, yet still packs a punch literally with six different flavours to excite your taste buds! 
Refreshing soda topped with Kyoho icecream and that overflowing torched Meringue at $9.50.\n<br />I cant stop scraping that meringue off. ✌🏼️
Featuring Spicy Thai Basil, Sizzling Chicken Lemak Chilli Padi Pasta, Beef Foie Gras Tagliatelle, Chilli Crab, Lobster, Seafood Okonomiyaki &amp; Butter Chicken Roll on the table and that is not all! There\'s more to come!
Here\'s Watermelon Lychee ($14) from their new Rainbow Bowls 🌈 series. A healthier and more refreshing alternative to the milkshake. Watermelon, lychee, granola, strawberries 🍓, chia seeds, drizzled with low fat yoghurt. I wanted to try the Mango Pomelo ($14) one but they ran out of mangoes.
Not as over the top as Banana Nutella or Old School, but pretty decent. Next on my list is their Tim Tam OTT Milkshake. \n<br />Too bad it couldn\'t make up for the tough and tasteless Striploin and Fries ($22) I had. Even my extremely liberal dousing of ketchup couldn\'t save that. If only the interesting main of Chicken Lemak Chilli Padi Pasta was available.
you might find a fancy one for your liking here.
Apparently, The Benjamins made some changes to this oh-so-recommended dish. Firstly, salmon fillet became slices of salmon. Secondly, instead of placing the risotto, squid, prawns, salmon and etc separately by layering them up, they were all mixed together. Lastly, now you have a mini lobster!
I was shocked to see my beef chunks so red and raw! Noticed how hot the hotplate was with all those steam? Within a minute or two, the beef chunks were cooked to medium on that sizzling hotplate. So well-marinated, no wonder they tasted sooooo good without any dipping sauce. The vegetables on the side were decent but the beef just outshines everything else. Most importantly, I like that I can control how cooked or raw I want my beef to be. 😋
My personal choice... The vanilla shake was blended with banana and nutella laced the cup and toppings. Still a sweet dessert but full of flavor and richness of the ingredients
This vanilla shake comes top with all the old school favorite snacks and biscuits... It\'s all sugary goodness, best for those with sweet tooth. Personally I chose another flavor that\'s more palatable 
Nice rainbow cake that is bolder in flavor than most I tried. It\'s a solid piece and good for sharing
Hmm a little disappointed with the small portion of crab meat, making the dish feel like an ordinary tomato-based linguine. :/\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note feeling quite thankful right now; I know that good things will happen so I\'ll keep trying and stay hopeful. :\")
A towering tower of dessert decadence. A statement on the excess of life. An heart stopping ode to the pursuit of vanity.
Over the top nutella banana milkshake ($16). Literally a cup of diabetes but oh well, this was my lunch! Although a little pricey, it was definitely worth it. I would recommend sharing the milkshakes with someone. It took a little long for it to arrive, which was a little disappointing. Still loved the milkshake! A decadent afternoon treat!
If you haven\'t tried the all so famous sweet/creative milkshakes, you should visit Benjamin Browns because their milkshake-brings-all-the-boys-to-the-yard (and they\'re like it\'s better than yours) 😂 it was so pretty to even look and eat it. It was filled with cake, sugar biscuits, bagel pretzel, loads of Nutella, bananas, whipped cream and also a chocolate wafer at the side. (Diabetics for a moment) but damn! Super worth the money and it is Instagram worthy!! Did I also mention about the tomato based pasta with real crab meat? It isn\'t too bad! Give this place a try :\') won\'t disappoint 👌🏻
Over-the-top milkshake which tastes as good as it looks. Sat atop are things like brownie, whipped cream, wafer stick, digestive biscuits and pretzels. Overall it is worth a try however the only waiter present that day was really impatient and rude and it ruined the service experience. Read for full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/10/benjamin-brown-bar-bistro.html?m=1
Super eye catching and tasty milkshake which is totally over the top. A must have when dinning in that cafe. Price $16
I remembered it to be more flavourful the first time and full of plump scallops &amp; prawns. Went back to be disappointed with the service and this bowl of pasta which had less delicious scallops and ruined with lots of chewy squid. Would\'ve been nice simply with prawns and scallops, but they just had to go OTT. 😑
🙈🙊 It actually don\'t look as big as it appears to. But still.. Please share the love! 😂
Strawberry cheesecake on top of the whipped cream with slices of strawberries, strawberry Tim tam and a whole wheat biscuit which was cut into  half. I love the strawberry cheesecake and smoothie has this strawberry cheesecake flavour in it as well, unique and delicious but expensive (SGD 16, 2 pax)
Banana smoothie with pretzels on top of the Nutella jam which come along with slices of a banana in between three pieces of biscuits (SGD16 for 2 pax) 
My very scary looking drink or rather I would call it diabetes in a jar or 1000 calories in a drink.😂 Got their hot favorite coffee avocado shake that comes w a mountain of biscuits, cakes and avocado. The coffee avocado is nice and thick, but once it warms up, it isn\'t very nice to drink anymore. The cake, biscuits and all on top wasn\'t great, so I actually didn\'t finish it. But, now time to head to the gym.. #burnitoff #burpple
Thick portion of meat but it was not juicy. The sauce was still acceptable though an apple sauce would have been better.
Order this is you are not concerned that your clothes will stink. The beef cubes are tasty but the aftermath was a greasy hotplate.
Good for sharing with another friend, but really pricey at $16++! The small slices of cake on the milkshake were way too sweet but everything else tasted fine. 
One of my favourite mains here: a generous wedge of salmon grilled to perfection – it\'s just on the brink of being cooked through in the middle so the flesh is still succulent, poised on a bed of chunky potato mash (I think some people had it with saffron rice), shrimp and squid in cream sauce.
Over the top Nutella banana milkshake ($16.90) // great ambience but a particular service crew service provided was quite bad . We waited for one hour plus for the food to be served to us . Firstly , when we came in the cafe was quite empty maybe less than 5 tables was occupied . We waited for 30 minutes , our food is still not served whereas other customers that came later than us already had their food and left the cafe. So we decided to ask one of the staff , is our truffle fries coming soon since we understood that maybe for brunch menu it might take quite awhile to cook . To our horror , he replied \" I don\'t know leh , not I take your order one\" than he points to the another staff saying is he help you take order you go ask him . Omg , can\'t you just help us key in the order ?? The attitude was quite bad but at least another staff gave us a 10% discount and he apologise to us . Definitely not heading back to this cafe again.   (Food : 5/10 || Ambience : 7/10 || Service : 4/10) 
Nutella banana milkshake with chocolate cake, pretzel,waffle sticks and biscuits $16
Strawberry cheesecake milkshake with waffle sticks, and chocolate,cookie and biscuits $16
Old school milkshake with cotton candy floss, marshmallow,cookie and waffle sticks $16
Milkshakessssssss! Sugar rush 😍😍😍 from left to right &gt;&gt;Nutella Banana &gt;&gt;Strawberry cheesecake &gt;&gt;Avocado Coffee &gt;&gt;old school  $16 each 
How not to be swayed by this gorgeous looking shakes! Welcoming calories with open arms. 
Milkshakes is super good with extra toppings overload and worth the price. 
For $18, this milkshake comes in really pricey. However, be prepared to be awed by many surprises including nutella, pretzels, brownie, whipped cream, sugar biscuits, choco sticks and banana chunks. A bit gelat so share among two. Brave the queue for a perk-me-up yall 💓
A very expensive treat! Filled with chunks of biscuit, choco bars, wafers, pretzels, nutella swipes &amp; banana. Found this a little jelat for one person but would be perfect to share! 
The Sizzling Beef Chunks ($25++) were amazingly good. You can never go wrong with beef and cooking the beef right in front of your eyes on the hot plate makes the whole experience even better! The Nutella Banana Shake ($16) is sinful but delicious. One can never say no to dessert but be sure to share the calories with someone else.
300g beef in a sizzling pan... Beef is so tender.. A great value($25) and good bargain to share the food while swallowing the over-the-top shake
Wells.. The title say it all., childhood snacks all stacked up in Tis creamy milky milkshake... I love the \"flower biscuit\" 
This is the real dinosaur! If the base is milo, it will be better thou.., 
Here we have the avocado coffee shake, at $16. you either love it or hate.
BUT ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE CALORIES. Go OTT or go home. This was diabetic, but share it amongst 2-3pax and you\'ll never get enough of it 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Love the garlic aroma when it served to me and it is pretty tasty with a slight spicy kick to it. And all thanks to @the_entertainer241, we get to enjoy 1 for 1 complimentary main by using The Entertainer App. So affordable!

If you intend to try one of their OTT milkshakes, go after noon. They have just put in place a new \"rule\" that OTT shakes are only available after 12pm. By the way, felt that my OTT Cookies &amp; Cream wasn\'t as impressive as my Nutella Banana one.
I ordered their aglio olio which is priced on the high side. The original one came with seafood but I opted for bacon. \n<br />I loved the pasta. The chef was not afraid to kick it up a notch with the spiciness. Also, it was full-flavoured with fresh herbs and chopped garlic.
🌼Rate: 6/10\n<br />Taste like juz normal coffee with a few slice of avocado on top and some biscuits and a lot of cream. Creamy coffee 😐 Not fascinated by the taste.
Formerly known as Benjamin Browns, newly-revamped bistro concept The Benjamins makes a splashy (re)entrance with the launch of their Over The Top Shakes ($16) — absolutely massive milkshakes topped with everything from the kitchen sink to your mother. Current flavours include Caramel Crunch, Nutella Banana and Tim Tams, but we say go for the creamy and fragrant Coffee Avocado, which is probably the most restrained of the bunch!
They launched this series of OTT shakes a month ago, and boy am I glad they did!
I suppose the universe was looking out for me because no one should have a burger AND this in the same seating. Such decadent milkshakes are all the rage now, not surprised if it becomes the new normal in the next 6 months. Anyway, what\'s there to hate about such behemoth of a shake? Plus the shake itself is not too sweet so that\'s something to like.
That I waited more than an hour for only to realize they forgot about it so I cancelled my order.\n<br />I\'m sure it would have been nice.
Cannot get enough of these chio Over The Top Milkshake from The Benjamins released 1 month ago! Too much calories after this meal.
Sizzling beef chunks. The combination of everything was just right. The sauce... The potatoes and the beef. However, the beef was a little tough even though it was medium rare. But overall was great. Pity that the milkshakes were all oos ): 
I decided to ask the friendly staff and realised that \'OTT\' stands for Over The Top, which is the version of the shakes that has been hitting social media hard. \n<br />Here is my OTT Nutella Banana Creamy Shake ($16), their best seller. An awesome combination of drink and dessert in one shake. My shake was topped with wafer, love letter, biscuit banana sandwich and a mini slice of Nutella cake. Two thumbs up.
May your day be as sweet and pretty like this [Old School Vanilla MilkShake] topped with candy floss, old school cracker &amp; marshmallows😱
I can teach you, but I have to charge. \n<br />So to be honest I came here because of how crazy this #overthetop #Nutella and #Banana #milkshake looked. Sadly the 4 of us couldn\'t even finish this cup! Lol. It\'s not bad and I loved how they were really creative with their toppings, but it just got a little overwhelmingly sweet after a while. Of course, this wasn\'t the easiest drink to share either but I can\'t imagine finishing a cup on my own! 😜 #benjaminbrowns #instaworthy #foodporn
The lovechild of a delectable threesome, fancifully decked with shards of Digestive biscuit, a wedge of New York cheesecake, strawberries, a smattering of crumble, and strawberry sauce meandering its way down the side of the glass.
The visual was overwhelming. I suppose this is not for those who are on diet or health-conscious. It is super duper Sweet and Sinful. Imagine indulging chocolate wafers, pretzels, biscuits, chocolate cake and whipped cream, all topped with chocolate syrup and nutella. 
Oh well, I\'m a big old kid then. Lol... so in love with the presentation. They even did a matching color(green) with my top!!! 😉😋
Hope I am not the last to try. \n<br />Coffee lovers will be smitten by this captivating Coffee Avocado milkshake ($16) - stacked with sugarcoated biscuits, waffles biscuit, coffee biscuits and avocado. \n<br />The perception of avocado seems to cut down the guilt in me to finish all these devilishly good yet sinful milkshake. \n<br />Have a good weekend everybody!\n<br />find out more from the link in my profile!
Thick, doughy and soggy crust, made worse with it being flavourless and horrors of all horrors, the fish is actually dry. Thankfully, this one here is far from all that. Thin, crisp crust which has that crunch as your teeth sink into it, revealing moist fish which flakes easily. Still, nothing beats eating fish and chips from a newspaper packaging by the dock. Ok, that\'s all.
The only dissatisfaction I had was perhaps at least 150 grams were made up of lumpy fats. \n<br />But thanks to the Entertainer App, I can get to enjoy 1-for-1 mains! \n<br />find out more from the link in my profile!
Throwback to pre-Bali, when I had this tantalising hotplate of US sirloin beef chunks and baby potatoes. Love how it comes all nicely seasoned with black pepper, and already cooked to a juicy, medium pink – just leave it on the hotplate to cook a little longer for those who prefer it more well-done!
Super succulent pork chop! for the portion, it\'s defs worth the price. Perfect searing || tender || $25 
Very good beef chunks, served sizzling and hot , will definitely will be back for it again || $25 
Not only is it so pretty looking, it\'s really quality milkshake! Abit pricey cause we ordered the over the top version but it\'s defs instaworthy and worth a try || $16 
So much ingredients that popped right in front of my face! Where to start drinking ah?
Nutella sauce around the cup sticked with Pretzel Cookies, wafer sticks, and biscuits all over, this is indeed sinfully fattening. But is it worth it? YES, maybe if it is a little bit cheaper. Definitely worth a try though! \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Probably the ONLY decent main you can order here because the other mains that were ordered tasted really BAD. The Fish N Chips were so damn dry to the point even the coffeeshop opposite my house selling the same dish wins it by a huge margin, and the grilled pork that they serve here wasn\'t even juicy and tender at all. 😤😤😤\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
[Smoked Benjamin Burger S$25] - not a burger fan but this is pretty good, tummy is satisfied with beef patty, bacon, egg, cheese and a side of truffle fries! 😍
Ordered the nutella banana milkshake and its very filling\n<br />me and my friend had no idea where to start at first 😂\n<br />Love the combi, its too sweet though,but thats okay ♡
These epic monstrosities have been flooding Instagram of late, and thanks to @alainlicious, I got to have a taste of them yesterday. This Coffee Avocado shake is a best-seller and it\'s no wonder why. It\'s delicious.
Was quite impressed by the savoury mains here, but my favourite out of all of them is this dish of al dente spaghetti and chunks of chicken coated in a creamy green curry-esque sauce made with coconut milk (hence the \"lemak\") and spiked with chilli padi – quite a lot of it, from the way the spice prickled and lingered on the tongue. Some may find it a tad too spicy, but I thought it was just nice and honestly, extremely addictive.
Had the Old School Vanilla, Nutella Banana and Coffee Avocado, all decorated with old school snacks bringing back the nostalgic feelings, but it is kinda pricey for what I\'m paying for. If I really have to pick one, I will go for this Coffee Avocado milkshake. At first I still had doubts about the combination of avocado and coffee would taste good together, but it is luxuriously rich and good. The milkshake has a very strong caffeine kick and with avocado blended together, it just makes it extra smooth and creamy.
A lot of liao. \"milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,\n<br />And they\'re like\n<br />It\'s better than yours....\"
Wow just wow. So sinful, so good. From left to right: Chocolate Banana (WHAT. WITH ACTUAL CHOCOLATE PIES?!), Old School Vanilla (look like Katy perry to me), Avocado Coffee.
The big afro-ed Scary Spice (you need to update your pop culture references - Editor) is all attention-seeking with its bright hair dye, pink accessory and Nicki Minaj-esque get-up but the milky experience was akin to drowning in the insides of a Hokkaido cow udder. 3/5
So CHIO, so Instagram worthy! Omg (can someone hold my jaws?) Benjamin Browns had launched their all [NEW] milkshake last week, featuring 4 different flavours! Can I wear it as an accessory and walk down Orchard Road with that?
This Watermelon &amp; Lychee smoothie is a sweet treat. Love the huge serving… another reason why I visit this little getaway in town, it\'s a great place to chill and watch the world go by~
For the chilli fans — This is one super spicy bowl of pasta… so those that can\'t take too much spice should let them know to hold back a little. Apart from the extreme spiciness, the pasta was flavourful and super garlicky with fresh prawns and scallops (my weakness). Definitely a dish I\'d go back for again. Plus Benjamin Browns is tucked away in Forum Shopping Centre. A good place to get away from the Orchard hustle and bustle.
Definitely not cheap ($16) but woah, this brings the word \'sinful\' to a whole new level. Yummy Chocolate Nutella Milkshake fills the jar and topped off with 2 slices of chocolate cream cake, sugar biscuits, chocolate wafer, pretzel sticks, banana slices, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and pretzels stuck around the jar with Nutella. Phew, that was a lot to type. Please share this sugar overloaded drink! 
Eating like calories don\'t count~ Benjamin Browns has introduced 4 Over-the-top shakes that bring the usual milkshakes to a whole new level. With the shakes you can just forget about your meal. A mind blowing creation, the mug is filled with yummy nutella banana milkshake but it is soon overshadowed by the ingredients stacked on top (bananas, chocolate cake, chocolate wafers, sugar crackers and salted pretzel crackers). An enjoyable beverage though a little pricey~
The only reason I got this was because they ran out of their Beef Burger as well as their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was pretty disappointing. I wouldn\'t say that this is extremely disappointing, but I thought that for smoked salmon, its something that you could get easily from the supermarket and would not be worth it. True enough, I was right. Apart form the use of fresh tomatoes and vegetables, the dish was very mediocre. Some compliments would be that the dijon mustard sauce was nice, providing some sweet and tanginess to the dish. Also, they were generous in the portion of smoked salmon given, but it was something that I could get for half the price and double the quantity at Cold Storage.
Passed by this little cafe and couldn\'t resist getting some cakes! They recommended the hazelnut almond (left) and the apple caramel (right). Mum and brother preferred the hazelnut but the apple caramel tasted like apple crumble so I\'m biased. Will definitely go back to try their Varlhona chocolate tart and sticky date pudding! Also, I know, photo does not do it justice. My thighs say no cake but I insisted.
The cakes look really pretty in the glass canisters laid out on the side tables, just too tempting. The cakes were not too sweet, red velvet was soft and nice (colleagues loved it) with the cream cheese; the chocolate cake paled in comparison, a little chunky. Overall a decent fare.
Chanced upon this yesterday and here we came for a little tea-time-escapade with my colleagues today. Not a large place but food\'s pretty lovely, cute and cosy ambience, and not too packed in this part of Orchard. Love it! 
Central location, pretty decor, cosy space, decent menu... what\'s not to love? Nice new find :)
This was yummy! An all-vegetarian dish, the mushroom and melty cheese on crispy toasted ciabatta came together really well. Served with freshly fried, hot thick fries, nice.
Simple ingredients, paired with sinful crispy bacon - all\'s good. A happy order. Recommended.
Looks pretty and such colourful serving of summer berries to go along. The pancakes were very soft but quite heavy and dense too. Not bad but not our favourite either. Couldn\'t quite taste the banana.
One of the better sticky date puddings I have had of late. Served warm on a pool of butterscotch sauce, it\'s moist and dense but not heavy. The ice-cream is perfect - still cold and solid, a great departure from the melting mess you get at some places. There is also a heap of fresh berries to help offset all that sweetness. (Price: $12)
Initially, I was skeptical about the look of the single small piece of brioche upon which two equally small poached eggs lounged. But they tasted good and fresh, especially with the smoked Norwegian salmon and a dab of the hollandaise sauce (which I had asked to be served on the side). The hash brown was a nice savory touch which helped to raise the modest carb level on the plate. Pretty good for a cafe in a mall (Price: $19).
Cuppaccino on a cold rainy day! :) So hearty warming... #coffee #food
Norwegian Smoked Salmon Sandwich to end my day. Good food with a good friend @minnieboonie ❤
Another new experience?! Careful I don\'t get a cardiac arrest from all the excitement (and food)! 🐢 is stuffed with truffle, mushrooms, beef and carbs (and milkshake and chilli and beer not in photo). #omnomnom #BURP #latergram
This is really over. Wait till you see their OTT milkshake! \n<br />2x beef patty, roast pork, battered mac and cheese, fried mushroom and jalapeno! And the bun was injected with cheese! Very yum and delicious burger but also artery clogging!! #shinforeverhungry #sgeats #sgcafe #burger #foodporn #benjaminbrowns #fatdieus #nomondayblues #foodie #burrple #sgcafefood #whattoeatinorchard

Sizzling beef chunks at $28. Recommended eat. #tingzieeats #burpple
it does not have good texture. It\'s not crispy and feels like it\'s been let out for a while. Although the waffle tasted allright, the texture should have been better. At $16, it\'s generally expensive to dine here so we probably would expect better quality food..\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#thebenjamins#waffles#pancake#dessert#icecream#cafesg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
The mac and cheese underneath tasted pretty average.

I don\'t remember how much it was. The taste was nice but a little too sweet. Worth a try though!
Calling all peanut butter lovers!

🔸\n<br />This is indeed over the top for me. It does remind me of all the snacks i used to eat and some of which i still feed my kids once in awhile. Honestly, it looks super pretty &amp; instagramable but is overly sweet for me.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The Benjamins\n<br />The Benjamins\n<br />Forum The SHopping Mall\n<br />583 Orchard Road #01-20/21\n<br />Tel: 6887 4117\n<br />🔸\n<br />🔸\n<br />🔸\n<br />#thebenjaminssg #cerealslycrunchyshake #sgdesserts #sgcafefood #dessertstagram #sweettooth #foodiegram #foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia #burpple #sgfoodie #sgfood #stfoodtrending #instafood_sg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #sgfooddiary #sgmakandiary #igsg #topcitybites #nomsterofficial #city_noms #foodbassador #beautifulcuisines #singaporeliciouz

Thick, creamy and dense chocolate milkshake which is garnished by chocolate fudge cake pop, chocolate wafers, Tim Tams, blocks of Cadbury milk chocolate and dollops of chocolate sauce.
I just love the cheesy taste!! 😄
So fresh so good!! 😋

it have been at least half a year since we been wanting to try it but somehow it kept get postponed or the shop was close/ sold out. 😐 was a bit worried about calories and taste cos before this, had quite heavy lunch... surprisingly this flavour is quite refreshing and overall yummy and attractive, it\'s not too milky nor overly sweet kind. Strawberry shake tasted natural.. one food resolution down. #Oysters (take 6 or more for $1.50+ each) got lots of salt water but after throw the water taste quite ok... 😋 #Dessert #DOTD #sgfood #burpple

This was our 2nd dessert for the night but was just enough to keep our inner sugar monsters humble. Once you get past the mountain of confectionaries and all, its just like any milkshake. #milkshake #benjaminbrowns #sweets #dessert #yummy #sgcafe #sgeat #sgfood #drinks #cafe #foodgasm #food #foodie #burpple
😄😋
And I love it come sizzling on the hot plate!! 😄
It was decorated prettily with all the favorites from our childhood days - ice-cream cone topped with blue candy floss, pink disc-shaped cookie, mound of cream, a small piece of chocolate cake and the mini candied cookies. The chocolate cake was delightfully decadent; and there was a thick coating of chocolate sauce around the rim of the mug, plastered with tiny rainbow bubbles that exploded in the mouth.

This is The Benjamin\'s Over The Top Shake - Nutella Banana. 🍫🍌Trending dessert you have to try in town.
It definitely has enough calories to last me for a week 😅 #datenight #theboodies #nutellabanana #benjaminbrownssg #mrandmrsnarciso #burpple
Too sinful, too creamy. I stopped after two mouths.
Over the top milkshake -- banana nutella. 🍌🍫
😍 Just sans the cream and everything will be good for me. 👌
Throwback to the {Benjamin\'s Burger} filled with all measures of good things from crisp bacon to sunny side up egg, melted cheese and mushroom confit - shame about the lackluster buns and the dry patty becoz this looked the part of a landslide victory。

Avocado coffee milkshake with waffle sticker wnd biscuits $16
OTT milkshake. 
And I\'m most certain the {Pork Chop with Sweet Potato Mash} from @TheBenjamins.sg should do the trick。
I just wish there was more of the latter and less of the OTT flourishing overhead。 [NEW] flavored include Tim Tam and Thai Tea. Be sure to check them out (only) after 12pm。
The sweet potato mash is even better with a nice balance of chunkiness and creamy luxurious was to keep the pig company and happy :)\n<br />#canadianporkchop #peppercreamsauce #sweetpotatomash #benjaminbrownsbistro #sgcafe #foodsg #foodporn #burpple

Presenting to you this humongous {Over The Top Nutella Banana Milkshake}!\n<br />So happy I finally tried it! I like the variety of ingredients/snacks they use to make this - from banana slices to pretzels to Tim Tam biscuits... But it\'s way too ex so you\'re advised to share it!

It\'s really over the top sweet.  Once is probably enough.  Now to the gym to burn it all (or at least some 0f it) off ...
seriously, we only live once. why care about all the calories or fats or whatever your worries are, if you\'re a true chocolate lover like myself?? I was disappointed when after a long time after ordering the Tim Tams OTT which I saw on their IG, the wait staff told me it wasn\'t available. but this is so good, I would like to order another one! or maybe the Caramel Crunch? or the Coffee Avocado?? give me all!!! 😝😋 @thebenjamins.sg @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia #singapore  #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgcafe #sgcafehopping @cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood @sgcafefood @sgfoodie #dessert #milkshake #chocolate #nutella

Would prefer if it\'s served with mushroom sauce instead as the black pepper overpower the taste of the meat. Overall taste pretty good for the price of $25
The dijon mustard used in it creates the sharp and tangy flavor. \n<br />I did not have high expectations of their mains as I only wanted to try the milkshakes. But the appetizing mishmash of prawns, scallops, salmon and squids with the tomato salsa is indeed a pleasant surprise.

would aptly describe our moment with the trending old fashioned milkshakes at BB. [Nutella Banana Milkshake, $18.99 with GST]
You could see the sparkle in people\'s eyes as this cloyingly sweet dessert come to their table. There are so many toppings that you dont even know where to start from.

The milkshake tasted creamy and milky ~ not overly sweet imo. Service was slow and amateurish - will not wanna return again given the pricing and service rendered 😟
Ok, that\'s all.
This is not most overwhelming milkshakes that I\'d tried..
Will you do the same too? 😅

Another new main on the newly revamp menu at The Benjamins. The salmon was seared to perfection, surrounded with the prawns and squid, drizzled over with crafted cream sauce. All these seafood madness was served over damn delicious saffron rice. OMG, I can eat this all day!
New offering at the rebranded The Benjamins (formerly known as Benjamin Browns). Served on a hot plate with aubergine and baby potatoes, the juicy beef chunks are succulent to every bite!
