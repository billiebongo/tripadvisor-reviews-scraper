Drizzled with mayo and teriyaki sauce, each juicy piece of oyster was encased in batter and fried to crispy perfection. Bringing me back to my short school exchange at Hiroshima, the deep fried breaded oysters were a must-have there. Kaki (Japanese for oyster) also being one of the first few words we learned, I came to enjoy them in Japan whereas before I usually avoided them. Still loving Katanashi\'s lunch set menu, the Fried Oyster is just as satisfying as those I had in Hiroshima.
Love how the Ikura complements perfectly the half-cooked salmon. Every mouth is a delight. 👍👍
Top: Hanpen Cheese (S$6.80) - fried fish cake stuffed with cheese and mentaiko mayo sauce.  We feel it\'s too over-rated. It wasn\'t piping hot nor warm when served to us. Just a normal dish we feel. \n<br />Bottom: Katanashi Fried chicken (K.F.C. @ S$2.40 each) and Katanashi style fried chicken wing dipped in special sauce (K.F.T. @ S$1.80 each). We didn\'t quite like the drumlet, I think Korean did a better rendition of this. The wings, on the other hand was delicious, with their special seasoning!
Filled with pork, grated yam, cabbage, spring onions, topped with bonito flakes and a thick sweet brown sauce. \n<br />What surprised us was the slightly undone middle, which is gooey and yummy! A perfectly executed omelette! 👍👍
Not your usual yaki udon, but definitely the best I\'ve tasted so far with it coated in onsen egg, dusted with seaweed, mushroom and bacon bits.
$12 nett, and comes with salad and miso soup. Fried chicken was crispy and the vinegar and mayo combination was delicious as well. And of course an onsen egg helped seal the deal. Really good option for lunch in the CBD. Skip the sashimi bowls - the last time I had the salmon and maguro bowl, it was not good at all with lukewarm slices of fish.
Look at my bowl of Chicken Teritama Don!!! Large chunks of crispy deep fried chicken drizzled with sweet teriyaki sauce and topped with a perfect onsen egg, all on a bed of rice!! All lunch set comes with a side salad and miso soup at $12 nett!! What a good deal~ Also on Katanashi\'s lunch menu is Unatama Don with fluffy eggs and sweet unagi!
Always a great place for lunch since the set menu here are available at $12 with a mini salad and miso soup. And we tend to order Chicken Teritama-don which has crispy fried chicken drizzled with Teriyaki sauce and mayonnaise when we\'re feeling down 😋
Japanese tapas restaurant Katanashi offers a number of satisfying donburi options, made really affordable by their $12 lunch sets that include a side salad and miso soup. Go for their Unatama Don, with grilled eel coated in a sweet soy sauce glaze, or their Chicken Teritama Don, with deep fried chicken drizzled with teriyaki sauce and mayonnaise, and an onsen egg on a bed of rice. Don’t forget to bring your favourite colleagues along!
Went during lunch and order the Unatama don $12 for a set that comes with side salad and miso soup. I felt that there was too much sauce in the Unatama Don which made it too sweet and rice was not hot enough. We also ordered the Katanashi Fried Chicken at $2.20/piece which was quite pricey for a small drumlet. The option to order per piece was very attractive and despite it being pricey, I enjoyed the tenderness of the fried drumlet. It was a unique experience and I would recommend ordering to try.  Will wanna be back to try their Japanese Omelette which was not served during lunch. 
12 nett, lunch set. Rice bowl of unagi with egg, served with dressed salad and miso soup. Very comforting - tender and sweet eel with fluffy rice and egg. Only thing is that the rice was perhaps not warm enough to cook the egg and I was eating raw, gluey textured egg. Definitely worth a trip though. No reservations for lunch. 
my favourite: fried chicken, a runny yolk on rice -$12 set lunch
They have 5 thick slices of pork marinated in ginger, garnished with seaweed and spring onions. I was expecting the pork to be the thinly cut stripes so was kinda surprise to see it otherwise plus it\'s also much more difficult to eat them. Think I will stick to my Chicken Teriyama the next time.
The Chicken Teritama-don has deep fried chicken on rice with Teriyaki sauce, mayonnaise and soft boiled egg. Love the place as the set lunch menu are available at $12 served with miso soup and mini salad.
Hump day\'s egg porn. Cue gleeful face.
A bowl of rice topped with grilled eel, spring onion, onion and omelet, with teriyaki sauce
dunk it in wasabi and soy sauce and then into your mouth. \n<br />that charred yet fresh flavor. 😋😋
New Jap restaurant located at 1 Boon Tat Street.\n<br />Am sure you will enjoy your visit.\n<br />(Thou  shall not say much)
how almost every cuisine in the world have their version of cooking eggs. which do you like?
raw interior, crispy exterior. the wasabi tartar was the killer. a very good dish. hello maguro 😋😋
home made wasabi. how can\'t you love their food. simply gorgeous.
Would anyone have expected this lunch set to be $12 20 years ago? One of the rare benefits of globalization, expect to have really good food at low prices at this lovely shop. Only at lunch time though! Nonetheless this is a great place to de-stress because everyone is super chirpy!
Staff here were so friendly!!! They are Japanese so that gives the place slightly more authenticity. However food-wise, expect fusion style rather than your traditional sushi etc. overall pretty good place for winding down after work on a Friday, try the omelette and tofu salad!
Deep-fried fish cake stuffed with cheese, served with cod roe mayo. Yummm.
Green tea flavoured bracken rice came served with chestnut ice cream. Loved the chestnut ice cream!
Check out those gorgeous flecks of vanilla seeds 😍
Reminiscent of Taiwanese Tan Tan Mian and Zha Jiang Mian. Flavourful and the udon was thick and firm. Delish
Interesting idea and i guess the potato and salmon were good on their own; not sure why they put them together though
The mochi skin was a little too thick for my liking but the texture was Q nonetheless. The dashi stock was warming and gratifying 
Torched right before our eyes. This was juicy and firm, and reeeally great. Served with condiments like negi, mustard and a wedge of lemon
My favouite dish of the night, cold, juicy and packs a flavourful punch. The Ponzu contrasted well with the saltiness of the maguro.
Japanese rice cakes in sizzling stone bowl with butter. Pour over the Dashi broth to create the volcano eruption effect. 
Raw salmon with butter, cod roe and soya sauce in sizzling hot stone bowl. 
Raw tuna sealed with bread crumbs and served with wasabi soya sauce. 
One of the grand highlight at dinner was to witness the preparation of this dish right in front of your eyes, with the blowtorch scorching the surface of the fish.
Fresh tuna and avocado dressed with homemade tartar sauce and served with toast. 
ok now it costs $12nett instead of $10.20++.... same same. 
One of the nicest and cheapest Japanese food bar in CBD. A definite must try!
this place mainly operates as an Izakaya for the after-work crowd, but offers a limited range of rice bowl sets (all $10.20++) at lunchtime. Price includes a side salad and miso soup.
Working in the CBD means expensive lunches.. On a budget? On days you need some happy food, here you will find yourself smiling, at the $10.99 sets, the cute scribblings on the menus and the animated greetings of the staff. the set comes w salad and miso soup.

Super fatty thick slices😍 roasted beef don was chewy though...
Hunted down Katanashi and finally got to try the unagi bowl! For $12 nett, it came with a cold chawamushi, miso soup, pickles and of course-Unagi with sticky sauce and fluffy eggs atop rice. Yummy and much value for money!
But having all 3 mixed in a bowl, is a first.. And it\'s so good! All the negi monsters would love this too.. But I had to painfully pick them out from the noodles. 😞 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#katanashi #japanese #udon #mentaiko #noodles #kimchi #syxxeats #dinner #burpple #cafe #chill #eatoutsg #food #foodie #foodonfoot #foodphotography #foodpics #foodporn #foodspotting #instafood #nomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #singapore #yummy #sogood

Thick slabs of fish merry beautifully with the vinegared sushi rice leaving a very very happy me. (7.1/10)

Back at my fav jap place for lunch!!! 
.
It\'s good comfort food 👍👍 great texture and nice flavour.
It\'s good value but I\'m not used to the warm sashimi so probably won\'t order it if there\'s a next time.\n<br />#salmon #maguro #sashimi #donburi #sgfood #sgrestaurant #japanesefood #boatquay #burpple
Came here during lunch and ordered the unagi set. We sat at the counter seat and as expected we smelt like the place after we left. Food wise: I was slight disappointed as there were a lot of hype about this place and staffs seems to be Japanese (i.e. Raised my expectation further). However, when set was served, the rice was lukewarm and Unagi tasted normal. The chicken drumlets side dish was not bad. However, I probably will not come back again.

I\'m not usually a fan of Japanese style omelettes but i really liked this one! Filled with pork, grated yam, dried shrimp cabbage and topped with mayo, brown sauce and bonito flakes.

Another! #foodporn #glutface #pescatarian #cheese #japanese #happiness #doubledate #saturday
I think this was the place lol it was on peel street near Rene Levesque. I had the crispy chicken and my friend had the spicy beef, the food was good and the price was okay i suppose but the service was chilly, it was like being served by stealthy ninjas working undercover as waitresses haha 
$12 set lunch that comes with soup and salad. Excellent service too! 
a nice break from office air conditioning...
