[$3] cheap and good hidden find in Amoy, this stall closes as early as 12pm once they\'ve sold out for the day. Love it\'s simplicity and fragrant coconut rice!
Amazing find. Such a gem. Only place in town where I could find puttu. A great healthy breakfast from south India. Only 1.20 \n<br />Amazing briyani as well for 5/6sgd and appam. \n<br />only using peanut oil. Make sure to come early, might sell out!
Best fish soup ever! Han Kee Fish Soup serves succulent pieces of sliced fish with price ranges from $5- $9. Words do no justice to the euphoria you feel when consuming this wondrous bowl of goodness
🤔🤔 don\'t quite understand why, not saying it isn\'t good but I wouldn\'t queue more than 10 minutes for this.
Even though there was a queue at 1:00pm, I didn’t have to wait long as bowls of ban mien was served to diners at a fast rate. Naturally, I went for their signature, the Dry Chilli Ban Mee ($5), and I was clearly satisfied at the end of it. The dry chili mixture brought a slight spicy kick and after mixing it together with the poached egg, black fungus, fried shallots, minced meat and anchovies, you are in for a comforting lunch. The choice of these simple ingredients complimented with each other, and in the process, able to make the entire bowl shine brightly in the spotlight.\n<br />.\n<br />Grandma Ban Mee\n<br />Address: 7, Maxwell Road, Amoy Street Food Centre, Unit 01-07, Singapore 069111
Can\'t rmb the name of the stall but this Nasi Lemak was really good! Aunty was fast in her service and the food came in sets. I ordered set 2 plus an extra Otah. All these for $4. Worth it 
Very generous portion of noodles. With fried luncheon meat and egg. Kick start a lazy morning with. Level 1 stall. 
Not your ordinary wanton noodles. Wantons stuffed with a whole prawn each, tender braised cha-shu, runny ramen-egg and an addictive potato prawn. $5.50, for a quality cross between ramen ingredients and wanton noodles. 😄 not forgetting the flavourful braised-with-pork soup 
For once I\'ll have to say: sorry Anthony Bourdain, but you should\'ve crossed the Ann Siang Hill.
This stall never fail to impress me. Is located at amoy Street food court #01-13, Yu guo curry rice red and white sign board.
Located at level 2, #02-117. Gotten the Large set at $4. Chilli was good but the pig intestines does have a slightly stronger taste. 
Ipoh hor fun with awesome fish dumplings and a mountain of green chilli #cravingsatisfied #damngood A guy even stopped by my table to ask me which stall I got this from, this is def legit.
Finally tried the Singapore style ramen from A Noodle Story! This was well-worth the $5.50 and the 20mins queueing time. It tasted abit like wanton mee, yet not exactly as well as the sauce is different from the usual ones that we have. Ingredients are generous and I must say, my favourite was the char siew which was really tender and good :)
Rare Lunch at CBD Area .. \n<br />Had been a long time didn\'t have Bak Chor Mee  ... It was a break ! A break to have Coffee Break with Ah Ter Teochew Fishball Noodle ! 😊 #hawkerfood
[老妈子板面 / grandma ban mee, #01-07] A new ban mian stall has popped up in Amoy. Menu has only three types of ban mian : chilli, soup and dry. Noodles were quite q and I actually enjoyed the chilli! Wasn\'t too spicy. Balachan(?) on the counter was pretty intense though. appetizing bowl of noodles and they were quite generous with their ingredients of minced meat, earthy mushroom and black fungus. ($5) 
If you\'re in the CBD area (or don\'t mind the trip there from wherever you may be) you have to try the AhLiang Ipoh Hor Fun at the Amoy - stall 02-122.
.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />The salmon is pretty alright, but I would say that the rest of the side dishes and starch eg. angel hair pasta) were kinda meh. Not exactly worth the $6.90 as the portion is kinda small as well. #atleastitried
Really tasty and cheap coconut ice cream costing $3 for one scoop and $4 for double scoop at lvl 1. Each comes with a free cup of coconut water. Can choose up to 4 toppings. My recommendation is the gula melaka syrup and peanuts combo. It\'s the best!!!😍
Do you know that famous fish soup place at Amoy Street Food Centre? 
Definitely different from Japanese Ramen, but all the toppings such as shrimp wonton, char-siu(seasoned with \"shio-conbu\"), a half-boiled egg and the signature potato-wrapped fried shrimp were cooked very precisely.
[Han Kee Fish Soup, #02-129] Yet another favourite from Amoy!!!! I finally decided to brave the long queue (took about 15-20 mins?) and no regrets - $5 fish soup that is so clear and sweet; these white thick slabs of fish are really fresh, cooked perfectly and quite a good portion.
[Teo Heng Teochew Porridge, #01-27] Ultimate comfort food. Love the Teochew porridge here, and the sides are delish!! Was lucky to be able to order so many dishes, usually it\'s sold out by the time I\'m there. Sotong was fresh, fish cake was so soft. Their braised duck, pig intestines, taugua were really tasty as the braising sauce was fragrant, well-balanced. My favourite of it all has got to be the steamed fish!! So darn fresh, and for one who doesn\'t like preserved vegetables, this was a life-changing one (ok I kid but it\'s seriously good) that made the steamed fish even sweeter with a slight tanginess in the broth. Spent $56 for all these shared among 4 of us. Not sure about prices but I was told it was quite reasonable, perhaps only the steamed fish was a little pricey. Oh and this is one rare stall that sells runny ramen egg instead of your typical braised eggs😍
$2.50 sweet black fried kueh. A fav for me especially as a snack to share with friends!
Cost: $2.30. Cheapest cai fan ever. Hands down! Want more? Order four dishes and it costs only $2.80! Slurps to cheap and legit food!
Love this pink png kueh, wit peanut and glutinous rice in it. And I love the sweet sauce and chili. 
Highly recommended by @willcookwilleat and I am ready enticed by those flakey crisp exterior with buttery aroma. #thecurrypuffincident
The signboard speaks for itself \"Yuan Chun Famous Lor Mee\" and they live up to the expectations. My mum loves this so occasionally I will make an effort to bring her here for breakfast. She loves the broth as it was smooth and sticky not like some she has tried which is watery, generous with their ingredients and most importantly the fish doesn\'t have that fishy taste. #hawkerpedia
Have been patronising Hai Kee Famous Porridge for almost 2 decades! \n
[Good Day #01-25] At $4.50, this was pretty good, they were so generous with the beef and sauce! Beef was very tender, and overall it was tasty with wokhei. The sauce was so flavourful it actually became a bit too salty towards the end. It might be good to share. I\'ll definitely come back to try the other hor funs!
Back at the hawker hunk stall (Ah Ter Teochew Fishball Noodle - #01-47) 😂 this time to try the soup bak chor mee which i was told tastes better than dry. I think I have to agree with that. The soup was packed with flavour and I got the $5 bowl so there were more ingredients. Special mention to the pork liver (which you don\'t get in $3 if I\'m not wrong) - it was nicely done! Not overcooked nor overly pink, and no gross smell. Instead it was well marinated with Chinese wine and the texture was just right.
Interesting concept though the coconut ice cream could have more kick. Not exactly the cheapest too. #kokoicecream
Taking a midweek coffee break with a yummy cup of Hot Seasalt Caramel Latte (Takeaway/$3.80) ☕
Best. Fried. Hor Fun. Ever. The stall spared no expense on the ingredients and it only costs $4 for a hearty serving!
even our hawker scene is slowly evolving and customizing to our ever changing taste buds.
A pretty hearty serving for $6! $5 without additional premium toppings (i.e. tuna, broiled meat, etc.).
Only the Teochew porridge staples here, but they were all rather good! Is this the case for all good Teochew porridge stalls? I especially liked the braised duck here.
😎: Sua ku me don\'t know that they actually have  level 2!😂 glad there was a desserts shop selling traditional desserts to cool me off on a hot day! I used to get them at $1 each 8 years ago?hahaha!\n<br />💰: S$2    \n<br />💯: [3/5] 
Searching for affordable &amp; delicious spaghetti? Well Chef B at Amoy Food Centre has it! Penne was done al dente and the chicken was tender &amp; the spices was so good, worth it
Omgawdddd... so so so good. $5.50 overflowing with happiness!
2.50 onwards. The lor mee isn\'t the famous lor mee at Amoy. But it is a big name at Albert St. The fried fish is g-o-o-d. And overall, I enjoyed the gravy and the noodles. Generous portions for price. On the other hand, beef noodles was meh. 
U will notice that the stall owner insisting on making &amp; rolling flour on their own adding the filling to it. Even though it is hard work &amp; tiring for them they told me it is worth it Even Regular will still patronised their stall. The Stall Owner told me that he will put abt 40 to 50 pieces of puff in one tray &amp; deep fried it. The Stall Owner also ensure that he uses fresh oil to deep fried the puff. This ensure that the oil doesn\"t have the stinky smell &amp; he will chang every 2 to 3 hrs of the operation hrs.
If u want to have a good curry puff come to Amoy Hawker &amp; find out. The curry puff stall is owned by a couple. They will usually handmade the curry puff from making the dough &amp; adding filling inside &amp; wrap it. The Owner sell Sardine Puff Potatoes Puff Black Pepper Chicken puff &amp; Yam Puff.  If u all wanna try pls come early to enjoy as the owner making the puff batch by batch.\n<br />Name:J2 Famous Crispy Curry Puff\n<br />Address:7 Maxwell Road #01-21 Amoy Street Food Centre Singapore 069111\n<br />Operating Hours:0800 to 1600 Daily will close early once sold out.
teochew styled bcm which is one of my favorite stalls here. \n<br />a winner anyday. can\'t say about the weather though.
why 9 months? because this stall is so famous, it\'s nasi lemak gets sold out at 1230 during lunch!! upon hearing that Amoy is gonna close for renovation soon, we decided to come out early and queue for this. and my verdict is - 😩 MEHH. I guess it\'s because this is super cheap. my plate cost just $3.30 😄😄 happy lunch eats everyone. I will continue to show you guys eats in Amoy before it closes
I like the fried pork 🙋🙋🙋🙋. midweek is not here yet and I feel utterly exhausted.
found this 🙌🙌 teochew bahchomee (mince meat noodles) at amoy. at jusy $4 you have meatballs, fried wanton, mushrooms and that great stew of mince pork. \n<br />on another note, anyone keen to explore singapore southern islands this weekend?? thinking of something interesting to do
Conspicuously positioned at a corner unit on the second floor of Amoy Street hawker centre (#02-78), Coffee Break serves both local and Western-style coffee. So \"kopi\" lovers and latte lovers can get their caffeine fix together from one spot. For the latter, there\'s also an impressive range of flavoured syrups to adorn your drinks with. This includes sea salt caramel, sea salt mint, cinnamon almond, toffee nut, roasted almond and more. I had a plain iced latte ($3.30) and found it more than acceptable, especially when you compare its price and size to the ones at proper cafés. Non-coffee drinkers might like to try their Red Tea or Vanilla Milk drinks which come in different flavours too.\n<br />If you fancy a bite to go with your drinks, their \"kaya toast\" makes a decent snack. A pocket is first slit in a slice of toasted wholemeal bread before being filled with some \"kaya\" and a thin pat of cold butter. This is also available as a set for $3.30 with a \"kopi\" or \"teh\". 
Here is a stall run by yet another elderly couple. They offer a pretty good selection of YTF stuffed with either plain fish paste, fish paste with mixed vegetables, or minced pork. Apart from the standard chilli and sweet sauces, customers can also choose to have black sauce drizzled on top.\n<br />This is a good spot for breakfast if you fancy a healthy start to your day as they are open in the morning.
Fresh steam fish. Only cooked upon order. Decently priced teochew porridge style
Han Kee Fish Soup is one of the two popular fish soup stalls in Amoy Street Food Centre. Needless to say, you have to brave the queue to enjoy superb fish soup. They are far from stingy with the fish, and you can tell that the fish is really fresh - delightfully tender with no fishy smell. Without the addition of MSG, the incredibly tasty soup is rich with the pure goodness of fish stock that can only be achieved from a lengthy process of boiling fish bones. Health-conscious foodies will take delight in this!
Wrapped in pandan leaves and stuffed with a generous amount of ingredients, Hoo Kee sure makes one of the best rice dumplings. They\'re huge because they\'re packed with whole chestnuts and lean pork. If you\'re feeling extravagant, go for the one with the salted egg. If not, try the one with mushrooms! The glutinous rice is fragrant, moreish, and perfectly cooked. This is one kickass ba zhang. And no, it doesn\'t have to be dragon boat festival for you to enjoy these.\n<br />Photo by Hoo Kee Bak Chang
The aunty here is really like the grandmother who makes sure you\'re well-fed. Exceedingly generous with ingredients, this stall keeps people coming back with their value-for-money noodles. The char siew noodles are loaded with boiled wontons, fried wontons, char siew, and veg. But the mushroom pork rib noodles are the star. Instead of char siew, you get a good amount of super flavourful, super tender fall-off-the-bone pork ribs atop a good serving of noodles. How awesome is that?
Don\'t say I never share. Yeah it doesn\'t look appetizing at all. But it\'s damnnnn delicious! The best curry rice I\'ve had is the famous scissors cut curry rice and I think they have met their match. You may opt out the gravy if you don\'t like your rice to be goeeyy. Oh and it\'s really cheap and the owner is friendly. :)
One of the best stalls in singapore serving fish soup, teochew style. Soup is clear with no distinct taste of msg. Fish slices are thick. For $5 you get a decent protein packed meal. Tip: Stall owner taking your order can be quite a Nazi. Ensure you communicate clearly and swiftly when giving her your orders. Avoid crowd by starting to queue at 11.30AM. 
Singaporean style ramen at $5.50. Super worth it as it was full of great flavors and ingredients. My favourites were those unassuming hk style wantons at the corner, looks can be deceiving as they were delish and filled with juicy prawns.   :3 
Fresh fish in a clean tasting broth that\'s worth the wait!
[Chicken Cutlet Noodles S$3] [Wanton Noodles S$3] \n<br />#noodlelicious at # 02-134
Been eating this for days and I still have craving for it :D plus the shop aunty is very nice~ Price: $3/$4/$5
The savory gravy went well with the smooth hor fun. But it\'d be better if the chicken wasn\'t so dry
for its price it\'s really a steal. The sauce was good too. curing blue Wednesday
My boyfriend recommended this dish to me when he was working over at Tanjong Pagar. I had always like fish sliced soup, so I was a little doubtful when he raved highly about this one, especially when I have tried so many around SG but none were really THAT good. Well, sometimes you have gotta trust a man on food. It\'s on the pricier side but it\'s superb. Soft, succulent and tasty. It\'s not tacky or tough like those you eat elsewhere at all. Be sure to head down before lunch hour or after lunch hour to avoid the insane crowd. 
Simple and nice dish during lunch break. The more you eat, the more you become sleepy desu :)
😋 we found one just right in the cbd area for all the healthy working people! 🍎🍏🍉🍅
Granny\'s Delight, a Malay stall at the Amoy street food centre #02-86 selling cheap and good local delights such as Chicken Laksa, Ayam Penyet etc. 
@Level 2 , just beside Rafee\'s Tea.. fried chicken almost bigger than the box! Yums
the generous portion and the yummy pork. my first time here and i can say im impressed. gonna try each indiviual stall

One of the best Teh Tarik and Teh Halia in Singapore. I am surprised that I am unable to find no one has posted this on #burpple!
trying to get a feel what it feels like to be working in de cbd next week. think imma gonna miss quiet east.
From Jin Hai Cooked Food. Basic fried rice. $3.50. Just like homecooked. 
I highly recommend this Fish Soup! In my opinion, the best Fish Soup that I have ever tasted. Freshly prepared everyday, the thick slices of Batang Fish goes well with the fish bones boiled soup, well complimented by either the Thick Bee Hoon or Rice. Queue starts from 11am, so go there early! This is one of the hawker affair that I can and won\'t mind queuing for up to 30 minutes during lunch hour! 
Price hike on the eve of new year eve. $3 dollars Wanton Mee and Ipoh Horfun becomes $4 dollars, as hawkers increased their price in view of the holiday period. \n<br />Personally I don\'t really brace this practice. What about your thoughts?
A $7 portion of fish soup with fish filled to the brim is mega goodness! 
Fried potatoes shrimp, onsen egg, char siew, wanton dumpling. Lots of Spring onion. Yum yum 😋😍
Healthy TGIF lunch ($4.80) at The Salad Bar. A box of fresh greens with corn kernels, cherry tomatoes, cut celery, brown rice, kidney beans and a boiled egg. Maybe I should eat salad at food centers more often, then paying $10+ onwards for rabbit food at other salad bars.
I like how irregular the fishballs shape are, but still taste as good! 
Springy Noodles, Hot Spring Egg, Meltingly Tender Cha-su, Crispy Jumbo HK-Style Wonton, HK-Style Wonton &amp; Freshly Sliced Scallions
Monday\'s lunch with Uncle Chua at #amoystreet! Had the all-time famous fish soup that has a MEGA long queue and a MEGA bowl of soup with a decent amount of fish slices,  prawns and veggie, best to go with the super deli chilli! Yumms! This bowl costs $12! ^(oo)^ #livetoeat #sharingtheloveofgoodfood #burpple #Sghawker
Skin was of just the right thickness! One more day to Friday people, hang in there(:
Authentic Teochew Kway Chap. Love what they did with the Chili. Flavor-wise it\'s bursting with Five Spices.
And the stall\'s not even operated by Malays. No, I\'m not joining this madness:P
Affordable spaghetti in Amoy Street Food Centre. Al dente and savory. $5.00.
Fried Beehoon with Fried Fishcake. Another of my favourite #Singapore #breakfast foods.
Chee Cheong Fun, oh how I\'ve missed you. #Singapore #breakfast
Not as good as what others said. S$2.50 (second floor near posb ATM)
Ah Liang Ipoh Hor Fun (Fried fish dumplings) for lunch! Happy Thursday! 😋
Not working on Saturday but I\'m back at Amoy Street FC for lunch! 😳 Cos\' I left my phone charger in the office, and didn\'t had a spare one at home! Forgetful me! 😑

Ah ter\'s fishball noodles. You just can\'t get enough of the soup. It\'s so good and so affordable @$4.50, anyone who has this option and who would think of McDonalds meal at $6.50 must be crazy! Haha

When you only have one item on your menu, it better be damn good and it sure is. Sliced wagyu beef stacked in layers over Japanese pearl rice, drizzled with homemade yoghurt sauce and topped off with a perfectly poached onsen egg.

Noodles from the Dry Chilli Ban Mee ($4.50) here are nice and springy, with a good kick from the dry chilli mixture. We always ask for more but..they would add only a little more chilli lol. Other ingredients include poached egg (yes!), minced meat, black fungus, shallots and anchovies. They complemented the dish very well.

lor mee or beef horfun. But the crave for meat triumphs over the other.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Long long long time ago I had this and it was not to my liking. But today, alittle voice said I have to try this again. So I was standing in line, observing Mr Pepper Bowl \"woking\" away. Big fire rose up prolly about a foot high. My kwayteow is on fire!! Wokhei!! Finally digging in after feeding my camera, the kway teow had a nice charred aromatic wokheish tone. Beef was tender. The onsen egg oozes and thickens the deep dark brown gravy, making it more gooey. A subtle pleasant hint of black pepper with a mini kick of spicy heat.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />No regrets trying this again. I liked it and enjoyed slurping. Mr Pepper Bowl did not disappoint.
😍 Piao Ji for fish prawn soup but on the pricey side and Han Kee for just fish and super generous serving! 🐟 which is your favourite? #comfortfood -\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #eathealthy #burpple #soup #fishsoup  #sgbrunch #brunch

A relatively \"quickie\" lunch. Angel hair pasta with  chicken leg and smoked bacon whilst my lunch kaki @tiara_star had chicken without bacon. Both garnished with mushrooms and poached egg. Whilst we goo gaa gaa over the runny flowy egg, the aldente angel hair... we felt that there was something missing. The chicken was flavorful enough. Just that we felt it needed an extra component to sort of make it complete.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />My little grouse was that the bowl is a tad small as everything was filled to the brim, making the tossing and twirling messy without some morsels spilling over. But it is kinda cute looking in that petite bowl.
Been thinking about it for the longest time. So yeah ... hell hath no fury if a woman does not satisfy her craving.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />This plate was decent because I just needed it. The old char kway teow uncle have been frying for many years. Judging by the constant stream of customers, I am sure many loved the old school taste. \n<br />#noodleholic #charkwayteow #jiaklocal #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #nomnom #whati8today #sgfoodies #sgfollowers #bloggersg #instafollowers #instagoodfood #singaporefood

How about these crisp wholemeal toasts with interesting filling options? \n<br />Tried their Pistachio, Tiramisu, and Black Sesame and the latter is MY FAVE!\n<br />.\n<br />#letsnomnomSG #coffeebreak #foodporn #foodpics #foodbeast #burpple #singapore #onthetable #wheretoeatsg #cafesg #foodsg #foodie #igsg #beautifulcuisines #hawkersg #hawkerfood
It seems that spinach soup is sprouting up in various hawker centres. This is seafood spinach soup in a clear broth with wolfberries and mushrooms. Very light and mild. Plentiful of spinach which outweighed the other components in the soup.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />Spinach contains lotsa vitamins and lowers cholesterol. So this is a super veg. Wolfberries well known for maintaining good eyesight. Rarely have I eaten and finished a whole bowl of spinach. Pleasant to look at as green is therapeutically good for the eyes... a soothing effect. This was slurpingly healthy good. A wonderful detox which I highly recommend. My tummy felt \"relaxed\" after.
3 meet 🍖 sandwich (S$3.50/ half sized)\n<br />It looked simple but tasted yummy savoury. The vegetables was crisp, the sourdough bread was light and crusty.\n<br />Served on a wooden style plate. Think 💭 it was the most atas looking plate I ever got to served with at the hawker centre.\n<br />Half sized sandwiches for breakfast (7.30am - 11am) at S$3.50 each\n<br />Full sized sandwiches priced from S$5 to S$7.50 but comes with a choice of soup.\n<br />|\n<br />Sandwich.com\n<br />Address 🏠 : 7 Maxwell Road, # 02-104 Amoy Street Food Centre, Singapore 🇸🇬 069 111\n<br />Open 💈 : \n<br />Breakfast : 7.30am - 11am\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Tanjong Pagar (EW15)\n<br />Note 📝: Got chop card 💳 where one can redeem free item
I am a \"noodle-holic\". Noodles are one of da best food around. So I will suss out the best of the best.. if not the bestest. And ironically, personally I think the good ones are found in our hawker centres. Not because they are inexpensive but because many are prepared by the baby boomers gen.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />On a tight schedule today, this is my \"eat &amp; run\" quickie lunch. Mee pok dry with a pretty old school taste. Mee pok uncle was quite generous slapping loads of chilli into the bowl. I was like 😨 ... sre my eyes going to rain later?? No pain no gain, right? I began chopsticking and mixing vigorously. Haha... color made me drool. Surprise!! The chilli, despite the fiery color, was to me abit mild. Tasted a tad sweet and I had to plough in cut chilli padis to achieve the \"high\". Fishballs quite springy but I love the tender pork slices. I find the soup to be more alluring and slurpworthy than the meepok. 🔸🔸\n<br />If you intend to visit, best to avoid lunch peak hours.

The chilli is piquant and the noodle has a good bite to it. Unfortunately I find the bowl of noodle too dry. It needs something saucy to complement the chilli sauce. While the slices of char siew was thick, it was too lean and dry for me.\n<br />.
I find the Truffle Wanton Noodle ($6/$8) fares much better than the original wanton noodle partly because of the truffle aroma. The truffle oil may have lubricated the texture of the noodles, so it was not as dry as the original version. I think it has potential to be an excellent bowl of wanton noodle but it needs to work on its char siew and wanton.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood \n<br />#weeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #wantonnoodle #trufflewantonmee

The chilli is shiok! Yumz  ordered the first bowl of the day, stall grandma ban mian, open at 10am #breakfastwmum #sghawker #sgfood #supportlocal #burrple
Grandma\'s Dry ban mian.. well.. you mian to be exact.\n<br />🔹🔸\n<br />The most enjoyable component, without a doubt, no surprises was the kick ass chilli. Mixed with lotsa hae beehiam (special request) and garnished with ikan bilis. Gave the noodles added taste. I am however very happy with the egg. See how yellow liquidy and flowy it is which made me compare with  a ramen place with onsen egg that had no flow. To me, this was poached perfectly in a humble hawker stall.\n<br />🔸🔹\n<br />It is a decent bowl of dry ban mian. Not so \"wow\" for me as I just enjoyed the chilli more. Can imagine it will taste good on steaming hot white rice.
One of mine is here, at Amoy Street Food Centre\'s Penang Kitchen (槟城小厨), #01-32.\n<br />Their fried fish lor mee is the popular favourite, but I took their specialty lor mee instead. Either way, still nice, lols. Just remember to add in the chilli sauce, which is what increases the overall flavour and dish level.\n<br />😋😋😋\n<br />#singaporeeats #lormee #amoystreet #먹방샷 #먹다가 #맛있는 #hawkerfood
Definitely something to consider if you are visiting Singapore. It\'s a great way to savor different local favourites in one morning 👌 check out more of my #MakanWithWestin escapades on insta stories!

Saw a new stall at #AmoyStreetFoodCentre, located at Level 2, just 2 stalls away from #HanKeeFishPorridge, selling this #TruffleWantonNoodle. (Sorry, didnt get to jot down the name of the stall! 😉😉)\n<br />•\n<br />Priced at $6 per bowl (small), 我可以隐隐约约尝到 Truffle Oil 的 香味. The noodles never 粘在一起，也没有 ghee 的味道, 👍🏻👍🏻!\n<br />•\n<br />Will definitely patronise this stall when I am back at #AmoyStreetFoodCentre for lunch. 🍜🍜\n<br />•\n<br />#SgFoodUnion #SgFood #CBDFood #TanjongPagarMRT
So I came here to look for it cos I remembered the horfun was super yummy. Well...I could not find it after walking a few rounds.\n<br />✴\n<br />Ended having black pepper beef horfun at Pepper Bowl. Had this moons ago. The first time i had this, the beef was tough. Today, it was cooked just nice....beef was tender and with lotsa gravy. The oozy egg was \"oozylicious\". So 2nd time was a charm.\n<br />✴\n<br />Because it was a very early lunch...I was feeling slightly hungry after 4 hours. A 2nd lunch in the works?? #lunch #8dayseat #burpple #burpplemessyeats #hungrygowhere #stfoodtrending #narratrs #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafollow #tripadvisor
I still preferred the dry version with the shiok chilli sauce. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #banmee #banmian

Give it a good toss to give the noodle a good even coat of the hae bee (dried shrimp) chilli, for a elevated fiery kick and lift in flavour. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #banmee #banmian #localfood
The texture of the noodle is actually not bad, soft and has a little bit to it. Unfortunately, the soup lacked the depth and robustness to match the delightful ingredients.
Tossed in sambal hae bee chilli...personally i find it not spicy but i had a side sambal belachan which had more kick. The ikan bilis provided the much needed saltyness. The clear soup ..well...needed more body &amp; atad seasoning. \n<br />Grandma\'s ban mee ..grd flr #noodles #noodlelover #banmee #lunch #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #stfoodtrending #opensnap #burpple #sgfoodies #bloggersg #igsg #igers #singaporefood #hawkerfood #instafollow
it\'s the long weekend and oh my, a feast galore.
The coconut meat was also very fresh and refreshing to have alongside with the coconut water after the chill.
It is great to have and comes with braised meat, fried fish and prawn rolls, though the gravy tends to taste slightly plain.
Mon-Fri 7am-4pm. Sat 7am-1pm. Sun closed.

on another note de famous lot mee at Amoy 🙋🙋🙋🙋
All these for $27
Reached at 2 pm after the maddening queue had melted away.\n<br />Ordered the smallest bowl which itself is a huge serving. It quantity of fish and #cabbage in the bowl was generous. I understand the soup is made from a #stock made purely from boiling the bones of the \" #batang \" ( #mackeral ) fish. Could make out some of the other ingredients like #shallots , #garlic &amp; #saltfish.\n<br />The fish soup was #tasty and worth coming back again 😊\n<br />#singapore #sgfood #foodporn #foodie #foodgasm #getinmybelly #instagood #instamood #snapoftheday #photooftheday #picoftheday #pictureoftheday #instapicturing #bestoftheday #photo
What brings this whole #dish together is the #spicy #chilli . The stall number is #01-61 , the stall name is in Chinese and hence i am unable to repeat it here. It is run by a lady, her assistant and her mother. The bee hoon &amp; mee come out delicious because of the soya sauce &amp; because it is not very oily. As for the chilli she should definitely patent it 😊.\n<br />#Bru #coffee is my drink of choice to digest the food btw Bru is an Indian coffee brand very popular with the #Singaporean #Indians. It is from Syed Mohamed Drinks stall #01-67 which is run by an #IndianMuslim. One of the best Indian coffees in this part of town.

Very tasty soup with thick pieces of fish slices priced at $10/$12/$15. Fried lard added to the soup supposedly to promote the taste of the soup, those who prefer not to can request beforehand. If only pepper and coriander(hate them!) wasn\'t added, it would have been perfect!\n<br />👍👍👍 #fishsoup #sgfood #sg #sgfoodie #lunch #foodgasm #foodspotting #food #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgfoodblog #pickyeaterssg #instadelicious #instafood #hungrygowhere #openrice
