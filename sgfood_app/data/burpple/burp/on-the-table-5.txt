The buttery croissants that are crispy on the outside and pillowy on the inside never fail to satisfy our cravings everytime.
Ordered the salmon mushroom and it was very good. It doesn\'t have the gelat after taste and definitely worth all the calories!!! It was very worth it as they are very generous with the ingredients and the pasta texture was perfect. Highly recommend!  
It\'s always a challenge finding a waffle within Pasir Panjang, so why not settle for one from On The Table which is easy on the pocket. At $12 for a waffle with three scoops of ice cream, this is pretty much the sort of happiness that one can buy with money.
Highly recommend this! Light, crispy waffles topped with 3 scoops of ice cream: Bailey and brownies (favouriteee), Peanut caramel and Earl grey. All for just $10.50. Quite a variety of other flavours to choose from! 
#Croissant is crispy and the portion is very big. Suitable for #Brunch. #Burpple
very worth the price, only $10 for waffle and double scoop! wide range of ice cream flavours available as well
Wings with honey &amp; spices ($10)\n<br />Really good and crispy with the perfect mix of sweet and savoury \n<br />‚≠êÔ∏è 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
Creamy mash with bratwurst &amp; snail sausage doused with sweet onion sauce.\n<br />For a \'snack\', if it very filling &amp; value-for-money. Really love the delicious &amp; special sauce that brings every element together. ‚≠êÔ∏è 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
I had the opportunity to lunch here today and I was looking forward to it since its Lola\'s other sister (and everyone raves about Lola). All the food we ordered was really good and didn\'t take very long. The one thing I found odd is that they only gave us a few minutes to look at the menu and decide what we wanted. I felt quite displeased though, I\'ll be ready to order...when I am ready right? Plus it\'s order at the counter so I felt like why am I actually rushed to order. I sincerely hope the management can fix this because it\'s weird...like you don\'t have enough menus? And I\'m sure I\'m not the first to pick up on this too. 
Second visit here! Had a taste of their salmon mushroom truffle pasta and swimmer crab pasta this time and both were pretty decent. The ambience of this place is really cosy, and I love the sofa seats especially. Although the waffle is small it\'s quite a steal at 12 bucks for three scoops of ice cream! Earl grey flavor definitely worth a try. Give the rum coconut a miss though, the rum was too mild in fact it didn\'t quite taste like anything at all. 
Ultimate croissant with ultimate satisfied brunch.. Filling with a full a scramble eggs, glazed bacon and ham ! Stomach was full with a yummy words !
It was a BRUNCH with Eggs Atlantic. Poached eggs on top of  #brioche toast.
Brunch? The first place that comes to my mind is On The Table. This is a place recommended by my sister, and I am so glad for the recommendation. Be sure to try their honey wings!!
The truffle sauce dip wasn\'t that fantastic but the chunky fries were GOOOD:)
Super goood! The truffle oil was so fragrant and went so well with the salmon and mushroomüòçüòçüòç I couldn\'t help but scrape all the pasta sauce to eat to continue to indulge in the goodness even after I had finished all the pasta!
Words just cannot describe how I feel now. I am just too glad and thankful tat the lonesome and dark days are officially over. üò≠üò≠üò≠ Cheers to a happier working life ahead üôåüèª #tearsofjoy #sgcafefood #openricesg #sgfoodhunt #burpple
Duck confit from On The Table. Whilst the citrusy sauce was refreshingly sweet, it could not distract me from the intense d√©j√† vu that I experienced of my many gloriously greasy moments spent at KFC during my secondary school days. 3.4/5 
Creamy yummlicious pasta! Pretty decent pasta to share, but found it abit too jeh-lat after too much.
Finger licking good wings. Definitely a must to order when here :)
Food of the day today. Chicken bolognese. The place not only serve presentable food yet good food!  
The cafe is stationed near the Pasir Panjang mrt which make it easily accessible, plus good food and excellent service allows us to have an enjoyable evening.
This time I had Rosewater Lychee Spongecake ($7) which is really lovely. Both in looks and taste!
Topped with Baileys &amp; Brownies and Salted Caramel. This has me craving for more! I think their ice cream alone can be a draw!
This is one of the best waffles and ice cream combinations I\'ve ever had. So good that we ordered another one immediately after!
Visited On The Table armed with my 1-for-1 mains offer on Entertainer. Overall was slightly disappointed with the quality of food, expecting more from OTT being a sister cafe of the highly raved Lola\'s Cafe which I haven\'t tried. The food was saved by the nice croissant to give it a mediocre score. It\'s prices are generally lower than most cafes out there but I found it to be slightly pricey given the quality that was served, even with the Entertainer. Had a nice time with Cephas on our first meal together as Burpplers which was quite hilarious for Anna, watching us intently taking photos of the dishes. Posts for individual items to follow soon. 
The Short Review
Anna commented that it tastes resoundingly similar to Nene\'s Korean fried chicken. I haven\'t tasted Nene\'s chicken before but I wasn\'t too impressed by these wings anyhow. Not a big fan of the flour batter as it gave it too much of a chewy texture to the skin. I liked how the honey tried to tread between the sweet and savory flavors but taste wise it was still mediocre. A plus point would be that the chicken they used was fresh. 
This dish was a favourite by both Cephas and Anna but I found this to be slightly mediocre. I felt that the truffle cream was slightly too salty and made me quite thirsty after eating it. The truffle oil that was used had a bit of an artificial aftertaste too it as well. The salmon and mushrooms were fresh and I would have appreciated slightly more Parmesan cheese. The texture of the linguine was nice though; it was more on the firm side and soaked up the cream sauce nicely. Overall, a decent dish. 
Couldn\'t resist not getting some poached eggs again - it seems like I\'m on a quest to trying as many Benedict\'s as I can! Of course, at OTT I couldn\'t ignore their Benedict\'s and so I decided to go for the smoked salmon one to ensure consistency in my tastings. Once again, I was lucky enough to get the better half of the eggs, with mine being nice and runny, soaking the bottom of the brioche toast. The hollandaise sauce tasted strikingly similar to bread yard\'s in terms of thickness and texture but tasted mostly of mayo. This dish got most of its flavour from the smoked salmon which made it quite one-dimensional and slightly tiring to consume. Perhaps after my experience at Bread Yard, I was hoping for something more interesting which I didn\'t get in this Benedict\'s, which was quite ordinary and plain. Flock Cafe\'s Cheeky Eggs is next on my list to try!
I called dibs on the croissant and the first bite was amazing. The scrambled eggs were done with the right amount of firmness, had a soft texture. Accompanied by the crispy and fresh butter croissant, the mix of mayo, honey, and ham made for an explosion of flavour. Although slightly salty, it was my favourite dish of the day. Only thing was that it was not really filling and to pay more than 10 dollars for a croissant would be considered slightly pricey. 
\nPeople flock to Lola\'s or On the Table for their brunch menu.. and to be honest.. Their waffles are much more worthy cause to travel across our island country for! These are the best waffles ever! Super crispy with every bite, even when the ice cream has drenched through the waffle, the waffle still stays crispy! We tried baileys brownie, which I felt was abit too sweet, earl grey which frankly was very good and milk tea, which was very good as well! After visiting On the Table for ice cream and waffles, and then visiting Upper thomson for supper, I realized alot of ice cream parlour up at upper thomson, can\'t even hold a candle to the ice cream at On The Table!
\nI am a mac and cheese lover and yes this was a sure win for me!! Not to mention BACON!  I love bacon too! The top layer was just right, slightly charred to give it a crispy texture and with the crumbs everywhere, it was a crunch in every bite. There was sufficient cheese spread around the entire dish, no one macaroni was not drowned in cheese!\n
\nTruffle fries, every cafe has them! Truffle Mayo? Say that again? Yes it\'s the perfect kind of mayo you want with anything fried!! We chomped down on this side dish and we vowed to always order it everytime we step into this cafe!! The truffle taste isn\'t subtle, it is actually quite strong but does no overpower the mayo. The fries were fried just alright, not dripping in oil and they were not soggy either.
I really love eggs especially the egg yolks that running down the ham n soak in the bread. Ooo so nice. 
The Jumpo prawn aglio oilo for my brunch today. The prawns are fresh n mix with the garlic + small chilli really nice ! The food really got the standard. My hectic day change to awesome afternoon. üëç
Just the right amount of honey. Well-fried and crispy and the meat is not dry. Yum. 
Croissant nicely toasted and the savory ingredients stacked to keep you full! 
Not sure if I\'ll regret all these carbs tomorrow, but hell, we only live once.
On a side note, Godfrey Gao is too suave can, he\'s my idol.
Shortlisting the Westerner cafes while enjoying our honey wings and coffee on the table.
Generous portions of prawns, but overall not as tasty as I expected. Still worth a try if you\'re in the area!

Mid wings well marinated with paprika and deep fried to golden brown. Drizzled with honey. Crispy and sweet on the exterior, tender and soft on the inside. One of the best wings in town! 
Starting the new year with a hearty brunch. Pretty decent food in a spacious setting - a rarity for cafes these days. Nothing too OTT for this cafe. #seewhatididthere. The brioche for my egg atlantic was of the right fluff and crisp and the hollandaise sauce was not too nauseating as some versions can be. My friend\'s Ultimate Croissant, as it was so named, was indeed quite the ultimate with the generous toppings. #cafehoppingsg #sgcafes #instafood #foodstagram #burpple
Comfort food for the soul. Love everything about this place - the food, the ambience, the space. Definitely worth a second visit, in fact I can\'t wait to go back for more!
They are the the brunch of people behind Lola\'s cafe but however, here\'s bit cosy and spacious!
Check out the sneaky snowman at the back! ‚õÑÔ∏è
Latte was really thin... not the kind i liked
As the sister cafe of lola cafe, the wings are not to be missed. With a more spacious space and lesser crowd...there\'s need to queue anymore!
Their alantic eggs benny, sauce was good with the eggs. However, smoked salmon, wasn\'t really fresh with a strong fishy taste, bread was hard too
Opened by the same people who started Lola\'s hence they have almost similar menus. The signature chicken wings which was crispy and tender with the honey glazed sauce. Fried with truffle mayo. Very generous with the portion! Ultimate croissant with screamed egg and Ham was good. We had seafood Agio olio with fresh and juicy prawns. Salmon and mushroom truffle cream was one of my fav dish but good for sharing as it may be gelat after a few mouth. Creamy but flavorful with a dash of truffle that brings out the aroma.

Whenever it\'s crunch time in the office, I can\'t help but lust after some crispy, golden-brown sticks that break apart to reveal moist, fluffy potato, complete with a luscious dip laced with aromatic truffle oil. Ah, comfort food. 
A little egg porn to start the day. So pleased that there\'s an all-day brunch cafe within 10 minutes of my home! 
At first, I had thought this was a Carrot Cake after misreading the description on the display card. However, the cafe\'s baker who happened to be standing close by, politely corrected me, and said the magic words, \"No, it\'s a Banana Cake\". In an instant, I was all over that display stand like a rabid monkey. Ordered one and without hesitation, burrowed into its dense, moist, banana-rich cakeness. Keeping it extra interesting were small pineapple chunks, a dash of cinnamon and loads of voluptuous cream cheese frosting. I truly enjoyed this, especially since I know for a fact that it\'s baked in-house.\n
Was surprised to walk into a rather empty cafe on a Saturday afternoon. Prices here wouldn\'t really make your wallet weep and the brunch items are pretty decent. My first go at Lola\'s famous wings, and I\'ll definitely be back for more! Some of the staff were great, while others weren\'t too warm and enthusiastic. Even though the cafe was barely filled with customers, one of the girls cleared our cups (I had a little latte left) without asking us. What exactly is the hurry? 
having this earl grey icecream from on de table. didn\'t get the opportunity to ask if it was freshly made or supplied. a tad too sweet. but awesome in this weather. üôåüôå come on ki qui
we\'re being overcharged. how do we as consumers regard daily necessities such as food being increasingly priced\" he commented. \"it\'s supply and demand. supply and demand\" she responded.
seems like this cafe has brought crossiants to a whole new level. üòçüòç scrambled eggs. cheese. bacons. the pastry was flaky and buttery which was so good. only downside was that the bacons could have been more crispy.
Baileys &amp; Brownie, Pistachio and Coconut on waffle ($12++). Their ice cream are self made and I must say they are pretty impressive given that they are not specialized in making ice cream. (They are just a little on the sweeter side) Super love the three flavors üòãüòã just a little more improvement on their waffles and it\'ll be all good. 
From the folks behind Lola\'s, they\'ve now opened a new cafe in the west (pasir panjang). Tried the Duck leg with mash, crispy honey wings, tomato swimmer crab linguine as well as fries with truffle mayo. All the food were to my liking but I would prefer truffle fries than to truffle mayo, me no like mayo and I feel that it\'s better to serve the fries in a shallow basket so that the ones below won\'t turn soggy. One more fave cafe into my list. Spent a total of $65. Staff are pretty helpful and friendly, love their interior too. Oh, and their beans are from Dutch colony as well if you\'re wondering üòâüòÑ p/s they don\'t have GST or service charge üòâüòâ
What more can I ask for? A table full of food and great conversation with the Bestie without the crazy queue. Perfect. And Wings are fried till crispy and drizzled with honey and sprinkled with Paprika (I assume). If you like your chicken wing crispy and sweet, you have to order this! The Duck Leg has an interesting orange glaze too! 
This place is actually the sister store of the very popular Lola\'s Cafe. Was there at around 8pm plus and it\'s actually not very crowded. It\'s a better alternative for people who are staying in the west, central or south. There were quite a number of seats and they were pretty spaced out so it\'s not like some of those cramp up caf√©s. Price wise is actually the same as Lola\'s. About $15 for an eggs Benedict and $16 for an aglio olio. When you\'re here, the honey wings ($9) are a must try. Their service was good too. After we finish our meal at about 9, we wanted to order waffles with ice cream. However after paying for it, one of the staff told us that they ran out of batter and ask us if we wanted to change it to a brownie instead. But we were craving for waffles so they refunded us and gave us a scoop of ice cream for the inconvenience. Hooray! 
Lola\'s cafe\'s sister cafe at Pasir Panjang is bigger and can sit much more. Beat the queues and come enjoy some quiet time at this outlet. The all-time favourite honey paprika wings are still served here!
üè† So happy to find a new place selling yummy food &amp; drinks üòãüòé
Yummy flavors of ice-cream, with hot and crispy-soft waffles, and warm chocolate sauce is the best combination for a after meal dessert!  (:
Burpplers love the larger, relaxed sister space of Lola\'s Cafe at Pasir Panjang! Go for the popular honey paprika wings and a simple brunch. 
The fried chicken patty wasn\'t very thick, and I found the use of nacho cheese a tad disappointing.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodporn #tslmakan #singaporeinsiders #burgers #8dayseat #like4like #visitsingapore #buzzfeast #foodporn #sgfoodies #f52grams #whati8today #foodstagram #foodgasm #sgfoodie #feedfeed #sgfoodtrend #followforfollow #buzzfeast #yahoofood #eeeeeats #singapore #foodpornmalaysia #igersmalaysia #foodiegram #onmytable #exploremalaysia #likeforfollow #Burpple

I originally heard about this place for this dish, but it seemed like they abandoned it a while ago when i first visited them, yet it seems like they\'ve reintroduced it! Personally I wasnt too impressed by it, since the Truffle scent was too faint for my liking, but anything with mushrooms, smoked salmon, al dente pasta and a good deal of (slightly scented) Truffle can never go wrong by me. Its probably cos Ive had so much Truffle dishes these days that its hard to really impress me when it comes to them, maybe only drowning a whole bottle of Truffle Oil into my bowl would then be able to suffice my cravings

Here\'s a yummy tortilla with battered pacific dory &amp; avocado.
Apart from their chicken wings, this is another dish that needs to be tried!!! I\'m not a fan of tacos n I only ate it once but this made me fall in love with tacos omg the fish inside was very fresh n the price is reasonable too if I\'m not wrong abt $10+ yup n each serving has 3 tacos üòô
Strong Truffle Scent infused in the thick creamy Cheese Sauce that soaks the al dente Elbow Macaroni together with fragrant bacon slices and topped with crunchy Cheese Bits. One of the better Truffle Mac n Cheeses Ive had for the price.
The pan fried salmon was relatively average and in fact had meat that was slightly tough and didn\'t quite leave a sweet after taste, although credit should be given for the runny egg, smooth advocado and crunchy corn that went well with the quinoa.
Was pretty disappointed that they didnt have the Salmon Truffle Pasta, but this dish retained the strong truffle flavour and smell that I was looking for so long! #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #thegrowingbelly #truffle #mushroom #egg #sunnysideup #toast #trufflemushroomtoast #onthetable #burpple

The wings were not that crispy and the spice that was sprinkled over the chicken did not value add to the flavor of the chicken. I think the hype is due to the honey drizzled over the wings.

Just superb! Poached eggs, brioche toast, dill hollandaise, smoked salmon, rocket leaves, served with salad. It only costs S$15. You should go and check it out.

The sweet onion sauce is perfect together with the sausages and mash.
Strong coffee
It\'s nutty and has a citrusy finish.
Freshly baked waffle with ice cream, a nv fail dessert
One of the best eggs benedict in town! Hollandaise sauce is slightly flamed! Definitely a must-try! Price is affordable as well! :-)

Really like how they done up the waffle! Slightly more crispy than normal and not too dense! The salted caramel can do with a stronger caramel taste tho. But all in all, very nice! \n<br />#cafehopping #cafeculture #cafehoppingsg #cafe #cafesg #coffee #sgcafe #sgfoodies #sgfood. #waffle #wafflewithicecream #singapore #foodporn #foodstagram #foodie ‚Ä™#saltedcaramelicecream #burrple #onthetable #pasirpanjang

This matcha latte has a rather stronger matcha taste to it and not too sweet. Quite nice! At least to me!!
