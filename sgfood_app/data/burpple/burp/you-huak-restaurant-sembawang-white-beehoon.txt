Finally got to try the famous white bee hoon. This was so good and satisfying. Imagine your fried bee hoon w a seafood broth. It was really good w the chilli! Another must order when you\'re there is their shrimp rolls and sweet potato leaves!
Pretty awesome white beehoon, always worth the drive. They do some pretty good omelettes too. #hawker #zichar
The bee hoon was very reasonably priced at $4.50 for a small plate. It was very tasty, soaked in a rich stock. The small plate of meat and prawn roll which somehow tasted like nuggets (in a good way) costs $10. Craving for both dishes as I type. 
Medium size was $8 and sufficient for two. Tasted quite bland so needed chili to enhance it. Queue was long during lunch hours and presumably dinner too.
Worth to try mihun for two -$8 , sambal kangkung $7 and the fish soup $6
All time favorite that is perfect as a main or a staple with side dishes 8‚É£
Imagine, soft bee hoon, which has been cooked and simmered slowly in deliciously rich chicken stock with a subtle sweetness of seafood. Add in a generous amount of fried eggs to soak up all that goodness, and a liberal serving of fresh seafood along with it, and you have a unique dish with a legion of loyal fans. This is like the love-child of hokkien mee and xo bee hoon, except there aren\'t any crispy lard bits nor wok hei; some may say that is why it doesn\'t justify the waiting time, but you could eat plates of this without feeling sick or \"jelat\". Also feels healthier, somewhat!
White Seafood Beehoon ($12). It\'s the wet style. The gravy is tasty and they r pretty generous with the seafood! Other notable dishes include the potato leaves, fried bean curd and ngor hiang!
D queued for ~45min to get the medium portion (SGD8) (on a Saturday night). Since this is not his first time, I think it\'s safe to say that it\'s worth the queue. This bee hoon is different from the kopitiam version in that it is soaked in gravy &amp; so you can really just eat the bee hoon even without the seafood &amp; egg.
Finally trying the legendary white beehoon! Beehoon was silky smooth and tossed in the sweet seafood sauce. 
So here we have the famed ÁôΩÁ±≥Á≤â. I\'d describe it as being deceiving ordinary. Do expect a truly flavourful experience with every bite. 
After hearing people rave and rave about this, I\'ve finally dragged my lazy ass down to Sembawang to try this famed Tze char store. Loved every dish on the table, favourite being the prawn omelette which was fluffy, not too oily and had a beautiful wok hei. In fact it reminds me so much of an oyster omelette, just that this is the prawn version. Chicken wings are a popular choice here- crispy, not too oily and easy to eat. Sweet potato leaves were not bad, but I was never a fan of sweet potato leaves. And of course the white beehoon which deserves a standalone post....
3 munchies: White bee hoon simmered in gooey egg gravy and seafood stock. A little more seafood sweetness and flavour would have enhanced the overall blandness of this famed dish.
The bee hoon is really tasty. The gravy was thick, unlike many other white bee hoon that\'s too watery. The other dishes were good as well. The fried tofu was crispy but not too oily. All in all, $34 for 3 of us, but we have big appetites so it could probably feed 4. Recommended, but go early to avoid queues. 
3 munchies: The well-marinated, crispy hei zhor (fried prawn &amp; meat rolls) could have been a lot more moist and tender on the inside. Having tried their famous white bee hoon, I still think this place is overrated, albeit great for family meals, large groups and supper.
Back to the original outlet at Sembawang and ordered a new side to to go along with our White Bee Hoon. Another signature of You Huak, these wings might seem skinny but are fried so crisp and juicy you would want more! What makes it apparently Indo-style is the lemongrass flavour which stands out from other fried chicken elsewhere.
Look like many of my friend wanna go try but they say too far. Seriously i went there yesterday it is super long Queue. I am sincerely apologised  to people who think is overated . One of my friend order the Fried Onion Omelette. Suprisely the Fried Omellete is Good fried till good perfection &amp; the presentation is good &amp; onion is super sweet.
Seriously can say it is their signature dishes. It has 5 stars rating by hungrygowhere website. If u are there be prepared to wait for at least for 1 hours. Some people to them say is not worth the wait but to me is worth it. The Stall owner uses freshes seafood ingredient to cook the white bee hoon. There is no pork fishcake inside. On the other hand i must say is abt their gravy it is very good &amp; go well with the beehoon &amp; their seafood. The slip sound come out while i was eating . Thank to my lunch companion @candicehbj @mademoiselle.melo &amp; my cgm @jemmgoh @johnbeckz taking their time off to have dinner with me while i was packing &amp; distributing the swissroll at my officer house. @carl_holmberg u should try this soon man. Name: Sembwang White Bee Hoon. Address:22, Jalan Tampang Singapore 758966 You Huak Eating House. Operating Hours:1130-2230 closes on every Wednesdays. The location is just opp Sembawang shopping centre.
Since mum said I\'m level-headed, a picture of fish head curry is relevant right? üòÇüòÇ
$12 for a generous serving of prawns, squids, eggs and vegetables in white gravy. Do avoid weekends unless you are willing to queue for a hour or so. 
Handmade and delicious. Not oily, fried to perfection. A must-have when having the Sembawang famous white bee hoon. || Price: S$10
(And also a money laundering shop in the process hahah üò±)
It looks white and plain. Almost like bee hoon kosong but it\'s damn tasty and flavorful. The ingredients are mainly egg, prawn and squid. Been eating this since young but tonight it was a tad too wet (too much sauce) nevertheless it\'s still yummy. Not sure how much this cost. 
One of our fav zi char place for work lunch! Not too crowded today maybe due to raining! 
Wet voluptuous morsels of textured vermicelli. Chili completed the experience. Excellent.
 The white bee hoon may look very plain, but trust me, the noodles are full of flavour! Here\'s a photo of white bee hoon. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/you-huak-restaurant-famous-sembawang-white-beehoon/
Indonesia fried chicken wings! A must tried if you head down here!
We both agreed that it was pretty average but the chilli was really good. Not something we would travel for but if we were to be in that area, we will definitely go for it!\n<br />‚öä\n<br />‚úè#JaeplusKaeReviews\n<br />‚ñ™\n<br />üíª JaeplusKae.wordpress.com\n<br />‚ñ™\n<br />‚ñ™\n<br />‚ñ™\n<br />‚ñ™\n<br />#igsg #sg #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodporn #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodgram #food #foodie #instafood #feedfeed #Î®πÏä§ÌÉÄÍ∑∏Îû® #Î®πÎ∞© #yum #delicious #dinner #chinese #noodles
A yummy must try is the white bee hoon that\'s light on the edges and will return to haunt you. The salted egg sotong here is the best we have tried not oily, not too stingy on the salted egg and with a crisp. Potato leaves dish here is one of the better ones so the dishes here overally promises a good meal for the family. Highly recommended!
ÁôΩÁ±≥Á≤â is one of the few food places in the north that we can be proud of! üòÇ there\'s just something special about this dish that can\'t be described in words! Have to taste it to know!!!

Simple #whitebeehoon soaked in sweet savoury base aka #sembawangwhitebeehoon + fried pork roll. Try them out! \n<br />That explains the queue.

Hate bee hoon, but when we are near here that\'s all I can dream about. To forgo this delicacy is a ÁôΩÂêÉ conclusion.
Their Beehoon is surprisingly silky smooth and fragrant eggy! üëçüèºüëçüèº
