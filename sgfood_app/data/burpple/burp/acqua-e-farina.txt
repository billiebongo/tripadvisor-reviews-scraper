The egg-based tagliatelle is made in house for a fresh and delightful bite. Tossed in tomato sauce together with mushrooms, Italian sausage and bacon, it is given a touch of cream to round off the beautiful flavours.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #italian #pasta
The combination of flavours and textures give life to the tender octopus for a delightful finishing.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #italian #octopus

I\'m not a fan of cheese but I would definitely make an exception for this. LOVE how soft and light the burrata is here, and it pairs well with all the other condiments on the plate! 
Finally had a chance to dine at Acqua e Farina for tonight\'s Burpple Eatup — had been passing by this place last semester on my way back home from school. I am not a big fan of Burrata in general for how thick and jelat it can get but this really suited my palate — the lightness and creaminess of the buffalo cheese, the sweet cherry tomatoes sourced from Italy (most of the ingredients here are imported from Italy to represent the flavours of traditional Italian cuisine the best that they can), cured flavours of the thinly-sliced Parma ham; all makes up for a pretty light Burrata dish that was easy and a delight to mop up.
