Their box style this year for the snowskin is a tower with gold designs. There\'s a faux jade as well. \n<br />This is the assorted snowskin mooncakes that comes in a box of 8. You can see the flavours in the next post. \n<br />As usual, #SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) members get specials. \n<br />#keropokmanMooncakes
The menu says calls it \'Claypot rice with wind dried sausages\'. Apparently wind dried meats are usually prepared in winter so the cold air will gently cure it. There are a few articles you can read about it online. My reading materials when I stay by baby\'s cot till she is deep in sleep. \n<br />Anyway, the \'laap cheong\', \'yuen cheong\', \'laap nyap\' and kailan here are not served on top of the rice when they are brought out. They are lifted and put on a platter for you.
For OCDs, they are nicely cut up too. Crispy and crunchy on the outside, still tender and moist inside. The \'sauce\' has \'modern plating\' too.
My parents are dim sum fanatics, so I\'ve tried my fair share of siew mais. I\'ve never actually found one that I liked: they were either too salty, too mushy, too fatty, or just unimpressive. The ones at Yan Ting are the only siew mais I eat. Yan Ting\'s siew mais are packed full with dried scallops, some mushrooms, and chunks of pork and prawns. None of that mushy minced processed meat, but real solid chunks. And besides, who could resist that adorable abalone on top?
Regis properties around the world raise funds for #Unicef as part of their #StRegisFamily #FamilyTradition. For the #StRegisSG, they organize the \'Mid-Autumn Fete - A Family Tradition at St. Regis Festivity\'. We are making mooncakes today. The number of mooncakes we manage to make, the hotel will contribute double the amount of mooncakes to \'Willing Hearts\' to be distributed.
Since I\'m still suffering from my throat infection, I\'ve been told that if I can only take a bite, I should go for the Cranberry Paste with salted egg yolk. Finally, a salted snow skin! I like that it is slightly fruity and not overly sweet and of course that pop of saltiness. Yum yums. Other new flavors include white lotus with lemon or lychee martini truffle. There\'s also the Mao Shan wang of course. Box of 8 priced from $73. Enjoy early bird specials if you order before 8 sep!
Have been most impressed with the service team at St Regis, both at ÂÆ¥Â∫≠ &amp; Brasserie Le Saveurs. Took the recommendation of the service staff Bruce today to order this fried rice item which is not on the menu. We did not regret, and I can tell you it takes a lot to do that as we have already conquered &gt; dim sum items between the  3 of us. This is a staple item and its huge. At the end, there was no further rationalization needed on whether its regret or sinful, it has conquered all of me, and yes we love all of you.
The finishing of a full bowl of rice... guilty!
Not the most impressive presentation but this is one hell of a premium cze char dish ‰πæÁáíËù¶Á¢å. 
Stand aside Hainanese chicken, HK roast chicken, Korean kimchi chicken...  I declare you the most tasty chicken!
Not just another gimmick dim sum trying to stuff all the expensive ingredients in just to boast their prices. These are the most amazingly tasty siew mai, I vouch for it!
A #YanTing #dumpling so huge, it\'s enough for four people to share for yesterday\'s #DragonBoatFestival, and then some. Glutinous rice first wok-fried, then filled with mung beans (ingenious addition ‚Äî so much flavour and texture), abalone, dried scallop, roast duck, roast pork belly, shiitake mushroom and salted egg yolk, and all wrapped up in layers of bamboo and lotus leaves. So much gorgeous aromas wafting through the kitchen when you steam it. Ok, that\'s all.
Instead of pinching salt the chef shoveled salt on them. So salty I sent it back and specifically asked the chef to taste it himself. Needless to say, chain of communication died between wait staff and kitchen, did not hear back from the chef. Maybe he collapsed from salt overdose.
Who was the one who said this is one of the best dim sum in Singapore? These bloggers, taste buds cmi. So this soup is reminiscent of adding Marmite to a can of razor clams, juice included. So if that\'s your thing, ok lor.
Served in individual flour sachets of pork and soup. What\'s more its served in individual dim sum bamboo trays. Now no excuse for piercing your dumpling, you had your own tray. Must compliment Yan Ting\'s soup is really nice, not just for this dumpling but the soup dumpling as well. It\'s not greasy or too rich.
The rice dumpling looks as endearing as it taste. Steamed in the lotus leaves (you can see the whole intact leave in the picture), you can taste that fragrance from the leaves infused into the sticky rice. The braised chicken filling with a whole mini abalone was wowderfully premium in taste and totally not out of place in this rendition of the classic teahouse dim sum.
I told J about the delish XO Sauce &amp; got her so addicted, she ate 2 plates &amp; bought a whole bottle that I hope she doesn\'t finish within a week! Not in this pic, our favourite vegetable dish \"Green Dragon\" &amp; her Steamed Milk with Ginger Dessert. I had my usual Homemade Almond Tea with Egg White. While fighting for the check, we realized that our Supper Club cards (which gives us 25% off) had different designs. I prefer the old design with the St Regis logo though. #yummy #foodporn #sgfood
This version of Char Siew Bao (bun to be exact) is fast replacing the traditional steamed bun, with various dim sum eateries, bakeries and restaurants rolling out their versions of this dim sum must eat item by various names: È§êÂåÖÔºåËè†ËòøÂèâÁáíÂåÖÔºåÈõ™Â±±ÂåÖ... But St Regis ÂÆ¥Â∫≠ version is so delicate and soft. The char siew filling is more sweet than savory. Which makes it the prefect dim sum item to end the meal!  It\'s no trade secret that they have to be baked fresh (think Roti Boy) but so many bakers/dim sum chefs often overlooked, or should I say the customers are not particular, hence such buns are still sellable after hours out from the oven. 
Steamed Seafood Dumpling with Egg White sauce. The challenge, is the making of white dumpling using egg white. Wrapped with seafood cubes, it‚Äôs a very simple dish but made better using the unique eggy skin.
Love the big springy crunchy prawns that had been intertwined together. The pumpkin sauce gave a sweetish and savory touch to the dish.
Juice, ice cream, jelly, shower bah, hair serum... The coconut jelly with ice cream at Yan Ting is fab too! Still thinking of where to bring mum? Head to Yan Ting! Review on the blog! @stregissg
Tell them you are treating her some \"Braised Superior Bird\'s Nest with Black Truffle in Pumpkin Sauce\" and see the huge smile on their faces. \n<br />Unless of course they are allergic to it.
Could do with some light tasting but flavorful Cantonese food right now.
Preferably in a pretty teapot. Need this headache to go away NAO.
This dumpling skin is made from Egg White! Wrapped inside are pieces of different seafood. Want some too? A new dish from #YanTing at @StRegisSG\'s √† la carte menu.
Expect new signatures on their list of classics and favourites.
Â∞èÈªÑÈ±º. Fresh, clean very healthy! The preserved vegetable goes really well too

Yes it\'s Chinese New Year in blogosphere. Heehee. Love love love all the braised items inside.
Crunch on the outside &amp; juicy on the inside. Coated with a sweet and tangy sauce. Apparently, it\'s @keropokman\'s fav dish...like ever! Did I get this right, @kopikosonggirl? üòú #love #yummy #ChineseFood
#Love this dish and the oh so tasty HK-style sauce! #yummy #foodporn
And he said to meet him in the kitchen. Then, he showed it to us and made this to eat. You know, as he said, it\'s easier shown than explained. I mean, why would we disagree, right? Ok, that\'s all.
This Lunar New Year, Yan Ting Cantonese restaurant offers exquisite yet hearty oriental delicaceies specially crafted by new Executive Chef Mak Kip Fu. Chef‚Äôs Signature Coffee Glaze is unforgettable. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/cny-2014-yan-ting-st-regis/
Rack of Lamb with Chef\'s signature coffee sauce. Pretty and delicious.
This fish maw soup was quite a luxury. Recommended by the service staff. It\'s silky, fragrant  and generous with ingredients.
Literally the largest Xiao long Bao I\'ve ever seen and eaten. You can\'t even see the spoon cos it\'s BIGGER THAN THE SOUP SPOON.
The best dish in the world is always one where least is done. Here, grouper slices are steamed with pickled ginger on lotus leaf in a bamboo basket. Doesn\'t get any better than this.
While there are so many fanciful mooncakes, I know most would still like the more traditional baked mooncakes with salted egg yolk. Check out Singapore\'s Mooncake Guide at DanielFoodDiary.com
No one can resist this.
Weekend brunch at Yan Ting is awesome. Everyone has a serving of double boiled abalone soup w/ chicken and lobster! And you can have unlimited supply of dim sum, soup, seafood, poultry, rice, noodles and dessert! HUAT AH!

Throw back to our sumptuous dinner the other night with the #BCMKakis \n<br />Photo credit: @misstamchiak \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #yanting #stregissg #dimsum
Am glad that #BCMKakis finally managed to find time on top of their busy schedule. \n<br />Dinner started with the dim sum platter. On the plate there is the crispy phoenix-tail prawn with yam, deep fried beancurd roulette with shrimp &amp; cheese, steamed scallop dumpling with spinach, pan seared meat &amp; mushroom bun, meat dumpling in chilli oil.
This is an indulgent serving of Braised Bird\'s Nest with Crab Meat &amp; Roe.
Located at St Regis Singapore. Famous for their Tim sims 
So, I ate more. Ok, that\'s all.
That person might love the fried rice more than you. Hmmmm.... #YanTing #StRegisSG #spglife

Reminiscing the sweet taste of marinated papaya, sweet honeydew, peach and snow pear with a dash of pomelo and zesty dried orange peel. #CNY2016 \n<br />Have a good Tuesday everyone!

Regis to start lunch on Saturday. #yummy #burpple
I am still thinking about the stewed pork knuckle from #yantingsg.  It\'s a traditional dish done with much finesse.  The meat was so tender you can cut it with your fork.
Steamed Seafood Dumpling wrapped with Egg White. #spglife #dumplings
Pan fried chicken with morels. So fragrant with the wok hei aroma when it was served. Morels are seldom used in Chinese cooking but here they do. So so addictive.
Part of the Mid Autumn Fete - A #FamilyTradition at #StRegisFamily Festivity.
Dimsum was underwhelming given the rather premium pricing 
Ok, that\'s all.
The carrot cake is soft and smooth, positively melting in your mouth.
Good try Yan Ting, but you fall short.
This was the cause for the soup not flowing out from the spout. Just eat it up first and it\'ll solve the problem. üòÉ
Had this with the amazing coconut jelly with vanilla bean ice cream. @stregissg
