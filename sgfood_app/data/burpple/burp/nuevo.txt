Perfect for those grab n go days or even for a light meal.
How about a cup of coffee for a quick mid week pick me up? If you\'re feeling peckish, you can opt for the pastry set as well ðŸ˜‰
Nothing like a warm bowl of soup to soothe the body (or soul). Get it ala carte or add $5 to your mains to make it a set.\n<br />Photo : @terrylee_
What better way to start the day then to grab a coffee and croissant? If this awesome shot doesn\'t entice you, don\'t know what else might ðŸ¤”
We won\'t judge if you throw in a bowl of pasta on the side too ðŸ˜Œ (carbs are happy food)
Drop by for some brunch today!
A tad tangy and quite light. Even though it was outsourced, it was actually nice. Pair it with coffee from @commonmancoffee â—¾â—¾\n<br />A bright looking dessert. However I wished there were bright friendly vibes. â—¾â—¾\n<br />A spacious cool place which is just about 5 mins walk from Paya Lebar MRT. No shelter from the sun as there are no trees along the way. So my advice is bring a brolly.
