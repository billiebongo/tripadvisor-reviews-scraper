Look at the egg custard, so smooth and almost dripping! The tart crust could be slightly crunchier but this is almost similar to the egg tarts at Honolulu cafe in HK!
Still one of my favouritest salted egg bao in Singapore. That sweet and salty milky custard that just oozes. ☺️ I love their spinach prawn dumpling as well. Transparent starchy skin filled w Chinese spinach and prawns. Adding that bit of greens to our dim sum brunch. 🌱 #burpple #sundaybrunch #dimsum
🤘🏻What did you have for lunch siol? Godma is love y\'all hahahahah 😝
Golden, yellow and oozing. Victor\'s kitchen is well know for these dancing warm babies! Soft and fluffy on the outside, and thick salted egg sauce oozes out like hot lava, making this Bao so desirable like a lady in red hot dress. Personally think it\'s hard to make, seeing how many attempted but fail miserably.
My must have whenever I am having dimsum at Victor\'s Kitchen! The softest, most flavourful and bite carrot cake I ever had period. The  steamed carrot cake is a mixture of the paste, and julienne radish/white carrot. The heavenly soy sauce had a hint of spice, giving the already delish carrot cake another dimension of taste. 
Went to tried this raved dim sum place,the dim sum served are decent, i would strongly recommend the king prawn ha gao, siu mai,char siew pastry. The liu sha pau is also one of the better ones i tried. Their ice milk tea is also served with ice placed separately from the drink to prevent dilution of the drink. Place is a little small so try to go earlier,be warn that it closes at 8pm👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I had high hopes for Victor\'s Kitchen Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns but it kind of fell short. The texture of the buns were not very soft and the consistency of the lava was strange. *sigh* However, the dishes were overall decent and quite filling. The unanimous favourite was the prawn dishes - the plump King Prawn Dumplings and Cheong Fun were pretty good. I personally enjoyed the egg tarts as the egg custard was really soft.
First time to try their food. Immediately I\'m into their prown dim sum and Liu Sha bun! You should not miss it! For sure the bun is the best one in ever.
On one hand because it\'s so versatile, and takes sweet and savory to a whole different level. On the other, because it\'s great to munch on while chatting with good friends.
Buns are quite big. $4.80 for 3 if I rmb correctly. Sedapppp.
Well I had better Liu Sha Bao the previous time I was here. This time, the custard seemed like it was gonna burst out of the bun anytime and the custard was real oily. To add to that, the salted egg inside was still in solid form and hasn\'t been fully turned to custard 
Must be really good because even the Dane is impressed with the \"Golden lava yolk bun\".
Stumbled upon this recommendation while searching for places to have dim sum on sethlui.com. Indeed, this was a good recommendation. The place can get very packed and tight during very busy hours but the food is oh so delicious! Everything we ordered was super good (better than Swee Choon I must say 😏😏😏) and I also enjoyed the mango pomelo sago dessert which apparently is served on Saturdays only. Damage was around 21 bucks per person. 
Went thr with my 2 of my bestfriends to try the dimsum! We ordered the fish congee, carrotcake, siewmai, spinach dumpling, liusabao, xiaolongbao, king prawn ching chiong fan! Hahas! I love the xiaolongbao and the carrot cake was different from usual, it was smooth and soft. It is also quite affordable when u go with a group of friends and share approx $11-12 perpax given with the wide variety of dimsum to tried. Tip bring water thr, their drinks are pricey.
What did you wake up to today? Tried pan fried cheong fun for the first time today. It was super awesome w the XO sauce(or whatever that spicy hei bi thing was)! Yum. And when the egg tart comes warm, the pastry is super fragrant and egg custard was super smooth. The har kow had 2 huge fresh prawns. ☺️
Love their Hong Kong milk tea here. It\'s thick and creamy and won\'t be diluted because it\'s in a bowl of ice water.
Other than their Liu Sha baos, you should totally get this when you\'re here. Even before Tim Ho wan baked char siew baos were famous here, they were making soft fluffy buns with a nice crust and tasty char siew inside! 
Obviously, It is nothing more than egg tart.. it is quite pricy, with only 2 egg tarts cost you $4.20. So what makes the egg tart worth to try ? Well, it gives me a different appetizing on top of the base tart and egg itself which i never tasted before. So, besides the crispy of the tart itself, the smell and taste on the base egg add on more value to try
HK iced milk tea would be drink that you shall try. Yes indeed it is just a simple milk tea but the apperannce serving is funtastic than other milk tea we usually have. \n<br />Milk tea comes with bowl. The ice is placed on the surrounding of the bowl to cool down the warm milk tea.
Can\'t resist with the golden lava custard bun. Not satisfied just to have 1 but it makes me wanted to grab more. Love the egg yolk when it squeeze out while either bitting in my mouth or tear it using hand.
Sad to say, but this is no longer my favourite liu sha bao. Firstly, the texture of the pau has deteriorated: crumbly and airy. Secondly, as I tore the pau, I could see layer of oil on top of the \"lava\". It\'s the oil that\'s oozing out and the lava is too liquid-y instead of goo-ey. Thirdly, the price has become rather unfriendly (for such a quality). Of course I can\'t compare it to Hai Tien Lo\'s mini salted egg pau (that are heavenly though pricey, but I don\'t mind paying for). I hate to say this but even the $1 liu sha bun from Baker\'s Talent is much more satisfying than this. *sigh
😁 Ranked as one of the top few liu sha bao in Singapore, this is definitely worth it! The salted egg yolk custard bun was oozing heavily and the outer bun layer was extremely soft! Definitely worthwhile coming here. 😋 #Sgfood #Foodphotography
Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun 黄金流沙包 ($4.80/3pcs), the must order item in this place. Still quite crowded during peak hours.
$3 but we really liked this! Served in a bowl of ice so it\'s kept cold but doesn\'t dilute the taste so yepp quite strong with a good balance of coffee and tea.
Decent dimsum. The golden egg yolk lava bun wasn\'t really flowy but it tasted pretty good. Prawn dumplings and the crispy golden shrimp rolls were decent (wish I could taste more of the shrimp for the latter but it was nicely crisp). The only dish we didn\'t like as much was the wala wala porridge (ting zai zhou) which was too watery and pretty much tasteless. 
Super shiok. One bite off this golden bun and I\'m hooked.
It\'s one of the days that you needed something to indulge on. This LSB never fails to amaze me each time I visit Victor\'s Kitchen. At it\'s hidden corner of Sunshine Plaza. Do spot their little yellow signboard 😄
Texture was rather dry, but could be better if it\'s steamed hot! It\'s one of the tasty treat you can get at Victor\'s Kitchen! 😄
Have you tried Victor\'s Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun? This is such a gem, a must try item when you visit Victor Kitchen for some dim sum treat! \n<br />This is as savory as how it looked in the photo! Don\'t stop yourself, why not go try one! 😄
In Hong Kong\'s tradition, this is how carrot cakes are served. This taste pretty good and left me a space closer to Hong Kong! Does anyone of you knows where to get the best carrot cake in Hong Kong Cha Chan Teng? 😄
It\'s my kind of habit to get a bowl of porridge/congee whenever I\'m on my hunt for dimsum, and it\'s one of the things I already evaluate the restaurant for! If you can\'t serve a good bowl of porridge/congee, then what makes you think that your dim sum is better isn\'t it? But victor\'s kitchen has proved me wrong on that instance. 
Remove the pau skin is as good as releasing the flow of the golden yellow lava!
They serve the best eggs tarts I ever have had in my life! Steaming hot that you can see the yellow paste bubbling, the hard crust is crispy and you can taste the \"baked smell\". Victor was smiling with pride when he served us this plate and told us to be careful as it was very hot. When you lift the egg tart with your fingers, you can feel that it\'s so soft that it seems that it\'s about to crumble. Yet, it doesn\'t.
Still the same awesomeness as before, one of my must-order items here.
Just ok, used to be better...then again, last time I was here was a year back
Still remains one of my fave dim sum from this place
Also another new item, but I didn\'t like this; the pastry is good, but the egg custard is pretty fail, funny tasting...it was smooth and wobbly though. 
Something new on their menu, filled with the same char siew they use for their char siew baos 😍
Lotus Leaf Chicken Sausage Glutinous Rice was just the right texture and taste.\n<br />Steamed Salted Egg Custard was perfect and not watery.
The sales staff in this dim sum eatery was hard-selling their polo bun to every single customer. I was not inclined to try as I did not have a good impression of their chia siu bao (steamed type) the last round I was there. Their cha siu was gooey. However, as they count down (literally announcing to the customers) to the last five for the day, I succumb to temptations seeing the satisfied faces of those munching in. Hmmm... But I did not regret. Their polo bun is that of a bread base (instead of bao 包 skin) coated with a nice layer of crusty butter crumble. The cha siu filling is savory instead of sweet, which is nice and you can find sesame &amp; herbs in the cha siu sauce which comes just at the right consistency.
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 best authentic HK dim sum does their \"steam stuff\" real good. Same goes for this very authentic dish of \" Hua-diao\" (a Chinese rice wine) steamed chicken, which is very often over-looked in this popular shop. Highly recommended. Chicken be wary.
Porridge is nice but ingredients are poor.
Very unique rendition of the traditional pan-friend carrot cake you normally have. You can taste the individual shreds of radish amidst the preserved sausage and the spring onion. Tastes much healthier and lighter too!

The accompanying xo chili sauce is damn power. Can taste the octopus bits within, giving that seafood flavor.
second time confirms my dislike for the dish here. too oily and too sweet. still prefer swee chuns one •﹏•
to me, the best simsum restaurants makes de best char siew baos. if the char siew bao fails, so does the place. fortunately the pao served here is good and tasty but lacking in ingredients
normally not a fan of these traditional dim sum but can be comparable to those served in de more upscaled dimsum joints in singapore
first up is their fried chee cheong fun. a new ploy to de old sch food...
Oh ya! Before I forget.  If you hadn\'t check out my previous 2 posts on Victor\'s Kitchen, the latest visit is up! Read up on more thedessertprince.com (sounds like marketing eh?)

A little different from the usual carrot cake, would love it if there\'s more sauce as once you eat the top half, there\'s pretty much no sauce left for the bottom
Not really a fan of char siew but this bun holds not-so-dry char siew that goes great with the skin
Well known for this \" liu sha bao\", I love how it is oozy inside. Though eating this became a mess very quickly. 
Love how the serve the iced milk tea. The iced tea is not so sweet, just the way I like it

This dish is like eating tau huay with chendol. Really interesting and its just right - not too sweet.
This dish is NOT for the faint hearted. If you can\'t take the heat then you\'ll have to go it a miss. However it\'s really a dish worth taking the heat for. The prawns are fresh and crispy! Try it if you dare. 
It\'s really crackling! Eat it by itself the pork is tender and crispy. Eat it with the chinchalok and the taste changes to a different dimension. Best!
This self serve Kueh pie te is really good. There pieces of prawn and pork in the stuffing and its juicy and tender. Top it up with the chilli sauce and its a pie te made in heaven!
Small, cramped, long queue, faster order, faster pay, faster eat. That about sums up victor\'s, an extremely down-to-watch eatery that promises you a real hk vibe
Scallop,sausage carrot cake with xo sauce! It is super nice! Must try!
Yum yum! Missing the dim sum here!! But the har gao came medium-rare and I ate 1 already.. Cut 1 open to verify and they re-steamed the one I ate and came back 2 only..hope the one uncooked won\'t give me diahherra.. -_- nevertheless it taste real good!!
Carrot cake with XO sauce, Steamed chicken with wine, SIEWMAIS, Chee cheong fun. 😁

By 11am, the hole in the wall restaurant is filled to the brim with customers.

It\'s probably quite obvious how much I like dim sum haha. First time here and quite disappointed overall - high prices (almost equivalent to that of restaurants) for the food that was ordinary. :/ Nevertheless at least I\'ve ticked off this place from my list of dim sum joints 😊
~$4.80 per item. Am I the only one that feels it\'s overpriced for its quality? \n<br />#dimsum #cantonese #sunshineplaza #bencoolen #bugis #burpple #burpplesg
Today\'s shades of yellow! ☀️😋👍🏻The dimsum here is impressive in terms of quality and taste! Worth a revisit.
All the prawn related dishes are just 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 I. Want. More. !
Warm char siew polo bun 😋 the egg tart is 👍🏻👍🏻 too
Haha. Tastes quite good too actually and pricey at the same time.

Albeit for the mildly split egg yolk custard which resulting in a mini oil slick on the palate, all was fine and dandy。

The bun was delicately soft, salted egg flowed out beautifully even with the slightest bite, and had the right balance of sweet and salty. So full but so good.
