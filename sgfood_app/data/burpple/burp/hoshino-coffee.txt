Unassuming little cafe/restaurant that we chanced upon on the 3rd floor of Plaza Singapura. \n<br />Here is the Hoshino Pot Baked curry rice ($15) with pulled beef, chicken sausage, broccoli, cheese and an egg on top. Check out that yolk action 😍
The stunning Fuwa Fuwa Hoshino Soufflé with Porcino Risotto ($16.80) features a fluffy egg souffle dome, cleverly prepared so it is golden on the outside and wobbly inside. Dig through the eggs to find a bed of mushroom risotto, creamy with cheese and peppered with savoury pieces of bacon. It is as comforting as it is pretty, but as it tends to get a bit rich, you might want to share this with a friend. Pro tip: The soufflé goes from risen to deflated in a matter of minutes, so snap pictures quickly!
This pretty looking pink-coloured Sakura Latte (hot) (S$9++) is yummlicious! This milk-based beverage does not have any coloring, though it looks as though it has. \n<br />Infused with cherry blossoms, this latte is light and has an aromatic floral scent, and I love it!
With caramel 》$10.80
Fluffy Hoshino Soufflé with Porcini Rissoto 》$16.80
An Omu Soufflé Tomato Risotto with Shrimp and Brocolli ($16.80)! Every now and then when I get the craving for some comfort food, I head over to one of the Hoshino Coffee branches for this fluffy creamy omelette. The tomato risotto complements the omelette perfectly to balance the jelat-ness after a few mouthfuls of the omelette. Yums! 😋
As a fan of banana and caramel and french toast at the same time, I couldn\'t ask for more! 💜 share it though! :)
To simply put it, this is a mushroom risotto with a wobbly (in a good way!) soufflé on top. One of the better menu items we had a Hoshino, that was well balanced in taste, appropriately savory. Just that we found the risotto to be slightly dry and unevenly mixed (too much bacon on one side, none on the other). Maybe it\'s a one-off mistake, and I should revisit the place to try it again 😝
Could not order half the dishes in the menu due to their \"ingredients not in yet\". Dish in picture was quite disappointing in taste (plus it was a lobster pasta dish yet no lobster, only prawns). However, Demi-glace Omu rice was delicious.
Fluffy toast with caramel &amp; nuts! Indeed toast to my day. The toast is crispy on the outside and soft inside. Those nuts gave it a bettet crunch. Add some whipping cream and scream sinful! \n<br />Well, even if its ice cream or gelato that screams sinful too. Hehe... Grab a cup of Hoshino Blend Coffee to complete it.
Third time ordering but still too watery on the inside ))))): Liked the matcha cream though 😅
I shall dream abt the awesome soufflés from hoshino tonight. Crunchy on the exterior and fluffy inside. #almosttgif #burpple
Prawn Mentaiko Spaghetti ($15.90++) - Not fabulous,  quite dry. Good flavour although if you are sensitive to herbs, you may not enjoy the herby aftertaste. Apparently this is from the same group as Ootoya (whose Prawn Mentaiko Pasta I much prefer)
For the love of dessert(s) ✖ Flatlay. 😂\n<br />[Things i do when it happens that we have a puhreety magz as a background.]\n<br />-\n<br />About the goods, it was nice..soft and sweet with a lil caramelised part - BUT that white scoop was a bit of a not-so-flattering surprise. It\'s a cream - when we were expecting a refreshing scoop of vanilla ice cream. [I mean, who wouldn\'t, right? With that look??] 😖\n<br />-\n<br />Just order knowing it\'s not ice cream, and you\'re good to go! 👍😊\n<br />-\n<br />🍞 French Toast\n<br />💰 S$9.80++\n<br />🏠 Hoshino Coffee\n<br />📍 68 Orchard Road [03-84] Plaza Singapura, Singapore.

Though known most for their hand-dripped coffee and pancake soufflés, Hoshino does a pretty great job at a simple French Toast with sugar and cream ($9.80). The pieces of French toast are super soft and fluffy, and go really well with the light homemade whipped cream and maple syrup. As Tastemaker Rachel Xie remarks, \'I must say it was love at first bite when I sank my teeth into one of those plush, eggy pillows. Meltingly soft and not too cloying, this is what sweet dreams are made of.\'
Vanilla Softee Kohi Zero ($13), soft serve with banana, a zuji, coffee jelly and Japanese cookies from Hoshino.
14. I roll my eyes whenever people rave about \"al dente\" pasta that is in fact mushy. This beauty here though is al dente, ie firm to the bite. Lightly dressed with bacon, sausage, spinach, eggplant, tomatoes, egg, sesame/mirin/?  Light yet filling. 
Well executed. The brown sauce was a blend of BBQ (A1) sauce and Japanese curry.
#好看不好吃. Ho Kua Bo Ho Chiak. 好睇唔好吃. There is this \"lao hong\" taste in every bite. I\'m guessing it\'s either the chopped nuts or inferior chocolate sauce used.
🛀🚿 This Sakura Latte with Soft Serve left us disappointed. Soft serve melted when it was served &amp; taste like (overpriced) milk. I can buy 3L of milk with that amount. 😏 #justsaying
Dessert for dinner anyone?
Another mid-afternoon, another craving. This time, my sweet tooth is yearning for the plush pillows of eggy, toasted brioche at Hoshino. Damn.
Served with a pitcher of maple syrup at the side.
Strawberries must be one of my greatest loves – I find them irresistible, whether in their unadulterated state or in snacks and desserts.
Couldn’t resist trying this once I saw @celest.lim posting it. The fluffy pancake soufflé is more like a light cake texture, a teeny bit on the dry side, but loved the ice cream and strawberries! Would’ve loved if the layer of cream the strawberries were sitting on was a slab (or two) thicker… but that’s just my cream addiction. Going back to try the other flavours—who wants to go?
 Hoshino\'s Spring Pancake Soufflé $14.50++\n<br />So after the waitress took our 7 orders of soufflés, all the 4 pancakes arrived at all table all at once! The strawberry ice cream was very smooth, it wasn\'t too sweet but the syrup they provided us was very sweet indeed! Use it sparingly over the soufflé, as it can drown out your taste buds and we had 6 more soufflés to try and we didn\'t want to kill our taste buds. The soufflé itself is alot harder than the normally fluffly soufflé. As it is a pancake, I would consider it more like a fluffier and slightly tougher version of a chiffon cake.\n
This Japanese cafe is famous for it soufflé and I must say they have lived up to their reputation! Every mouth of this soufflé is a pamper to my soul! Come try it at Plaza Singapura! 
Feeling a little down under the weather &amp; wanted something hot to warm myself. Sakura Latté tasted something like cherry however a little too sweet for my liking.
Awesome souffle, warm, fluffy. One bite and you will fall in love with it. One of the best souffle in town. 
TomAto rice with chz,beef, pork.. Mushroom. Cover with a fluffy egg cover.. Mmmmmmm but that\'s a down point it required to wait for 30 mins for them to make the flurry cover 
A seasonal dessert. Nicccccce!
The coffee was bad too, according to my friend. Not gonna go back ever again 😂
A tad bit sweet for me, the jelly and mochi added much texture to the dessert. Overall green tea lovers will really enjoy this!
One of my fav pancakes with whipped cream and one scoop of soft serve drizzled over with syrup. Soft and fluffy but the waiting time is forever, please order and get them to serve immediately. It will probably be served at the end of your meal
Light crust outside &amp; fluffy inside, decent sweet with maple syrup topping.
Almost all their dishes are splendid!!! I\'ve been going to hoshino very often and they have never disappointed. The outlet at Capitol and suntec are more private and quiet if you\'re looking for a diner that you could have long chat times with your group of girlfriends. :)
Their hand-dripped coffee is indeed full-bodied &amp; the acidity is just nice. The frothy macha latte is very yummy but expensive @ $9/cup. The vanilla soufflé is soft &amp; fluffy..taste wise nothing special though. Still prefer their pancake soufflé style. 👍👍👍
Admittedly the pancakes were soft and fluffy but it\'s a bit much to pay for one slice of real peach, one slice of canned peach, a tiny scoop of melting peach ice cream and lots of whipped cream.
Flavorful, rich and bursting with generous portions of sausages and a sunny-side-up egg atop katsu-curry based rice.
Took 20-25 mins for it to be served as it was fresh out of the oven. Worth the wait if you are craving for a soufflé. Warm and moist, like a sponge it absorbs and was drenched in Vanilla, would easily be a comfort food in my list. Choice of custard, chocolate or green tea dressing to go along w the souffle. 
Nothing peculiar, the pancake was still as pillowy good! Go for the plain, it\'s good enough.
Intensely flavored, sweet and very savory!! I prefer curry rice to Fuwa-Fuwa now.
Soft, fluffy &amp; light Vanilla Souffle with Matcha Sauce! It just melts in your mouth &amp; the serving of the matcha sauce was generous. 
Creme Brulee with Softee! The creme brulee was smooth &amp; perfect. The caramel at the top goes well with it. It doesn\'t taste so milky nor makes u sick of it after having a few spoonfuls. Yum yum in my tum tum!
too much egg white on de top she said. still I can\'t judge whether to like or hate this dish
Food is lovely 😍 hahaha.. Some 2 of the dishes ordered: French toast and super fluffy \"bouncy\" omu risotto!!
No, this is not the first of the 4 blood moons. It is just sakura milk tea. Was it any good? Well, it tasted like a sweetened version of strawberry milk. A little pricey for $9 I reckon
Matcha taste is not that strong though. Softee melts fast and it\'s already half melted when it\'s serve 
YEAZ 😱
Tomato rice with mushroom and ham and \"bubbles\" made from the \"well beaten eggs \" ... 
The cream is heavenly nice. Thick and \"GAO\" without the maple syrup is sweet ... But with the syrup has another taste to it... 
Had deflated a little already by the time it reached our table. The matcha flavour could have afforded to be a little stronger. The inside was actually rather hollow as well. Not up to par, unfortunately :( 
The dripped coffee is quite bitter. Main course was ok. May go for dessert next time ;))
So-so, expected a bit more! Green tea taste wasn\'t very strong. 
\"Fuwa-Fuwa\" Hoshino Souffle. Tomato rice under a fluffy cheese soufflé cloud, baked to a golden-brown cloud. #cheese #souffle #savoury #japanesefood #sgfood #foodporn
With great company!!😊 We 💖the French toast here! Fluffy, soft and yet crispy on the outside, goes well with the cream and lots of maple syrup\n<br />#hoshino #coffee #souffle #frenchtoast #tgis
Their hand-dripped coffee has a sour aftertaste which is quite unique. The pancake soufflé was tasty enough, light and not too sweet. It went well with the softee ice cream. Be prepared to wait though as it takes abt 20min for the soufflé to be prepared. 
“Fuwa-Fuwa” is the Japanese term for fluffy, and it surely held true to it’s name. The eggs in the souffle was just so soft and fluffy. It just felt as if you were eating marshmallows with that eggy flavour that is trademark with souffles. While the top was light in flavour and fluffy, the rice beneath had a stronger flavour as it was cooked with tomato sauce, and traces of ham and beef can be found inside. A dish that I would recommend to order here.
Second visit. This time with mommy and daddy. The coffee is a recommended try. #burpple
Not bad at all. Comfort food category for sure 
Soft and inside\'s like egg tart custard! Expensive though it\'s $13, good for sharing 
Single stack Fluffy pancakes ($9) gone in a bit, next time order double stack ($13) #sgfood 
It\'s so fluffy I\'m gonna die!!!!!!!!!!! #vsco #vscocam #dinner
Awesome French toast. Topped with , and I\'m guessing here, milk cream that has a really smooth texture. 
Super thick matcha, can\'t taste the latte but it\'s not bad! Love it! 
LOVE THIS. It\'s a must try here because its a SUPER FLUFFY soufflé. The term \" it\'s so fluffy I\'m gonna die\" is very apt here! 
Tasting slightly like aglio olio, to me it just taste mediocre 
Soft, tender chicken in between two nicely roasted bread with onions. 
This is superb. Love the creamy sauce with the rice. And it\'s a huge plate of fork licking sauce. $15 
I would go back anytime for their pasta and French toast! Not so much into their soufflé.. 
not very big fans for the pancake but love the softee. 
Finally here at Hoshino Coffee! The Lobster Bisque Spaghetti was pretty decent :D
Dinner with the usuals! Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me :\') Love you all many many 💖@malcolmooo @xjxnxa @zeetremendous @ssam_l @zacrificial
Come with 3 choices  of syrup; Maple, Honey or Brown Sugar. Decided to go with the Maple, the pancake is quite dry in the inside. Overall I thought its ok only, not very special expect for its thickness and presentation. #rachfoodadventure
Taste a little like macs pancake. Lower than what i expected
This is one of the best thing I ever tried. Fuwa Fuwa : (fluffy) - hoshino soufflé . It wobbles...

Fluffy French toast with the lightest milky Japanese homemade whipped cream. I could eat the cream forever, it\'s really good.  Visit Http://sethlui.com for more food reviews!
Puffed up pancake. No fanciful add-ons, just maple syrup and whipped cream. 
Slightly crispy crust n really soft n creamy texture once u poke through the soufflé! Try it with the vanilla ice cream to have a different sensation ! 
Essentially a cheese soufflé on top of baked rice. Pretty interesting, though perhaps a little pricey. 
The lobster bisque was rich and very tasty. One of the best I have tasted. My only irk was where is the lobster meat? But can\'t complain since it is lobster bisque spaghetti not lobster spagetti.
It\'s so fluffaaaaaye! And I loved the rice that was hidden beneath tho other ingredients were minimal.
Portion was good! Loved this.
I regretted the moment i ate the 1st mouth. Why didnt i visit this place earlier?!?! The whole deal was awesome and i sweep it clean in no time. Only bad is its a tad ex.
Matcha soufflé. Fluffy and eggy!
French toast! Yummy fluffy sweet
This is really epic!! Nice n fluffy with rice, beef n other amazing stuff inside the \'crust\'. I am sure heaven has one of these 😍😍😍
Not too eggy, delightfully fluffy and sweet
Oriental style Spaghetti with Eggplant, Tomato, Bacon, Shimeji Mushroom and Sausage
Beef curry with molten mozzarella in rice cooked in cast-iron pot
Hand drip coffee.
There is a reason why there is a long queue. Simply divine!
Okok, my picture does this no justice. Nope, it is not an algae infested sponge. This was soooooo good!
Too much eggs for me, but I absolutely love the tomato rice beneath~
Pasta was done al dente &amp; the Pescatora Seafood Pasta was piled with clams, mussels, prawns, squids &amp; scallops over yummy puréed tomato sauce. The Hoshino Spaghetti was loaded with Eggplant, Bacon &amp; Sausages but we found it too salty. #hoshinocoffee#hoshino
Yummy Green Tea Latte. #yum BTW, this is not in Newton, it\'s close to Plaza Singapura.
\"IT\'S SO FLUFFY I\'M GONNA DIEEEE!!!\" Wish I could say that. Sure, it was every bit as airy and cushiony as it looked, but somehow it fell just short of bringing me up to cloud 9. Was it worth trying? Yes. Will I eat it again? No. But hey, that\'s novelty for you.
A tad pricey at $9.80 for slices of fried bread with icing sugar and whipped cream, but I must say it was love at first bite when I sank my teeth into one of those plush, eggy pillows. Meltingly soft and not too cloying, this is what sweet dreams are made of. 
Finally! A Japanese curry that doesn\'t taste like it came from an instant pack! This one\'s richer and reeks of beefy flavour, and it\'s generously blanketed in melted cheddar, with a runny egg and slices of pork sausage. Pity they use a mix of Thai white rice with Japanese instead of solely the latter, though the curry is so tasty, I suppose I can forgive that. 😋
Too runny.
I\'m back for this Fuwa-Fuwa Hoshino Souffle. So satisfied now! :)
$15.80. If only they have it in curry sauce too, then I can have the best of both world. Nom nom 😋😋\n<br />#dhobyghaut #japanese #omurice #burrplesg #burpple
