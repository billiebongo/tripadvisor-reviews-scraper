Loved the brownie but we wished they could choose a different flavor of ice cream. 😅 natto damn niam niam. @dingdongsg serves up pretty dingdong fusion dishes on their set lunch menu. 🤔
This dish has slightly heavier flavours to suit mackerel and is best eaten with some rice. Reminds me of home-cooked mackerel with savoury sauce and a tinge of sweetness making it a very comforting dish to enjoy.\n<br />⋅\n<br />This is available in Ding Dong\'s set lunch menu.

Inspired by Thai pineapple fried rice, this dish is made of multiple textures to keep your tastebuds amused. Dip the pork belly into the pineapple puree so the sweetness from the puree and saltiness of the pork belly evens out. All lunch mains at Ding Dong are served with a bowl of rice.\n<br />Ding Dong\'s set lunch menu is available for:\n<br />2 courses — $28++; or\n<br />3 courses — $35++\n<br />Add just $10++ for a glass of wine or beer. 🍷\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />Ding Dong\n<br />115 Amoy St #01-02 Singapore 069935\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />#DingDongSG *
The dish is delicious, duck meat is good and wellcooked. However the curry itself is very salty, i hope they can tone down on the salt. But overall this is one of the better dishes out of all that i\'ve ordered.
This is the best dish in ding dong i would say. Tender beef, great sauce and so well done and balanced. Totally recommend this to anyone who loves wagyu fusion style!
Refreshing viet salad to start your meal can never go wrong. Again, is too salty and \"flavorful\" - at least for me. I wish is less salty and less fish sauces poured on the dish.
This is well cooked tender and delicious pork ribs. Good balance on both the sauce and the ribs itself.
Chicken is not bad, but pales in comparison compared to the two beef dishes! I\'d say, only order if you want variety! In fact, I prefer the quail to the chicken! 
Loved the texture of the beef!!! really melts in your mouth. Braised for 48 hour and the curry sauce goes perfectly with the meat!! Very well conceptualized dish. Love this, will be back to try the other dishes
Meat is super tender, with the right amount of fats and the sweet sauce is thick and packed with flavor. Cherry tomato is dehydrated, having a marshmallow texture. 😝 
Meat is juicy and succulent, even more tender than chicken! With a really flavorful rub and light sauce drizzled lightly over 
Filling is super tasty and well marinated! Skin of dumpling is very thin &amp; consummé goes really well with the dumpling. 
The piquant gravy was an appetite-whetting cross between tangy assam and powdery curry which the soft fish soaked up unreservedly. Elsewhere, the soft spinach displayed a multiculturalism Social Studies teachers would fawn over, speaking fluently in Chinese despite its Indian roots. 4/5
Instead, it\'s the decidedly racier Stylo Milo cocktail from Ding Dong - Milo, condensed milk, green chartreuse, Suntory\'s Distiller\'s Reserve. The ridiculousness of the cup alone is worth the price of admission.
This two-year-old bar and restaurant in the Ann Siang enclave boasts a new menu that you simply must try, if you haven\'t had the chance. Head chef Jet Lo has injected fun and unique twists to familiar Asian classics (yes, we\'ve heard this before) that might just blow your mind a little. Start off with the Vietnamese Scotch Eggs ($16), runny centred quail eggs wrapped in minced pork oozing Vietnamese flavours, then breaded and fried. The Wagyu Beef Char Siew ($29) is one dish you must try — beef so tender you only need a spoon to cut it, and flavours harmoniously layered yet intriguingly familiar. Don\'t miss the Crispy Duck Curry With Cauliflower &amp; Passion Fruit ($27), a duck confit that stands among the best, bathing in a mildly-spiced curry with surprising bursts of tart passionfruit. Order some cocktails to go with your food — they\'re fun and sure to please. The casual vibes make it a good choice for a fun and relaxed date night, or a small celebratory dinner for a small group of friends. Pro tip: The three-course set lunch goes for just $25 and features some of their à la carte menu options. 
How kaya toast tastes like when it\'s all grown up: Whisky, aged rum, Gula Melaka, pandan, coconut cream, egg yolk. YUM. A real crowd-pleaser that tasted just like the real thing. 
For less than $29, you could get a starter, main course (with rice) and dessert. Every course was great but their ala carte dish was even better. .\n<br />|\n<br />Instead of using regular pork, they used Wagyu beef for char siew. The sweet char siew sauce almost created a crust on the surface and its fattiness melted in the mouth. .\n<br />|\n<br />The coriander powder and dehydrated cherry tomato enhanced and created contrast in flavors. Well balanced dish and unforgettable experience.\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />http://www.jiaknonstop.com/restaurant/ding-dong-singapore
This two-year-old three-floor bar and restaurant isn\'t a new addition to the Ann Siang enclave, but it does boast a brand new menu that you simply need to try. Head Chef Jet Lo has injected fun and unique twists to familiar Asian classics (yes, we\'ve heard this before) that might just blow your mind a little. Think Wagyu Beef Char Siew ($29) — beef so tender you only need a spoon to cut it, and flavours so harmoniously layered yet intriguingly familiar. Don\'t miss the Crispy Duck Curry With Cauliflower &amp; Passion Fruit ($27), a duck confit that stands among the best, bathing in a mildly-spiced curry with surprising tart bursts of passion fruit.

Pro tip: the three-course set lunch goes for just $25 and features some of their à la carte menu options.
Essentially moist and crispy duck leg – so much duck juices upon bite in yer mouth – soaking itself in a sweet mild curry with a most zippy passionfruit tang. Comes with rice, but the shaved cauliflower serves equally well as curry sponge. 4/5
Essentially a ménage à trois involving three mango dessert concepts (mango sago pomelo, mango lassi and textures of mango) which ultimately remained cautiously tame and generated less heat than expected. 3.7/5
The honey-sweet char siew skin was a delight, whilst the soft, fatty core had the tight wobble of the sickest dubstep tune. 3.9/5
It\'s hard to explain why this combination works so well, but one taste and you\'ll understand this genius. I can\'t wait to come back to share this with my friends, this meal at ding dong was all kinds of wonderful. Super impressed by the strong south East Asian flavors throughout the meal, but reimagined with technical precision. Imagine a crisp leg of duck confit sitting in a mild curry, punctuated by fresh passion fruit, and gently balanced out by grated raw cauliflower that lends a surprisingly creamy note. Just. Wow. Also blown away by their Wagyu beef char siew (!!) and their fantastic cocktails. Prices aren\'t ridiculous considering the quality of food. Come for a fun date night, or an intimate meal with your best friends. Best for a Friday night after work, remember to start and end with cocktails! P.s. Really loved the Ca Phe cocktail, it tasted like the most heady breakfast coffee 😄
Featuring a Kaya mousse with Chocolate Ice-Cream and Chocolate mousse. Chocolate flavours were overwhelming, covering most of the taste from the Kaya mousse which was strong of coconut flavours, but the dark chocolate ice-cream despite being rich and not too sweet seemed to have a rather airy texture within.
The better dessert of the two; it is interesting to see how they have had used local elements to create a plated dessert. Sago Pudding is chewy, with Pandan-like sweetness from thick Gula Malacca sauce that binds them together. Meringue was lightly sweet, and gives a little contrast to the heavier sweetness that lingers around the other elements. The coconut ice-cream failed to carry the refreshing flavours, being rather bland with a rather \"meh\" texture and the popcorn definitely helped to give some visual impact, but seemed out of place otherwise.
Perhaps the most interesting dish served here and the one that made me decided to try this place out; never had I seen a Duck Confit done with a local infusion that seemed to be a tad inspired by Ayam Penyet thrown into a curry. The crispy duck leg was succulent and easy to debone with a pull of the fork. The rich and aromatic curry was a tad heavy on coconut milk, but went well with the savouriness of the duck. Cauliflower was shredded from its stalk and plated on one side, but the introduction of Passionfruit added a tinge of sourness which was a wee bit overwhelming for the ending note of the curry as well as adding seeds to the bottom of the curry which affected the overall the texture. Interestingly, rice comes along with this dish; a thoughtful touch where you would be able to pair the curry with.
A rather interesting dish that sees the play of textures, the burnt nasu (eggplant) is pretty chewy, topped with shredded crab meat that exudes the crustacean umami-ness for the dish. The crispy shrimp was like tiny balls of tempura crisps that did not carry much flavour, but definitely helps to add that additional fried crispy textures that makes this appetiser pretty wholesome on the tongue.
A fusion dish that brings Chinese and Japanese into one dish. Tofu lacked the silken texture that is typical of Japanese tofu, but it is smooth but slightly more solid akin to Chinese style tofu. While the ginger salad cuts the saltiness while inducing a sharp spiced flavour, the saltiness can get overwhelming for some with the miso induced into the tofu and the soy sauce beneath which is pretty rich.
My picture is really not doing the dish justice. It was so awesome I wanted to lick the remaining sauce off the plate! 
In the former, pineapple and calamansi are muddled together with tequila blanco, Cointreau, house-made pomegranate molasses and a dash of lime (to even out the sweetness, before shaken and strained over crushed ice. Garnished with pomegranate seeds, a thick wedge of pineapple and pandan leaf that adds fragrance to the sweet and fruitly oaked cocktail. Definitely one of our favorites at @dingdongsg.
Minced pork is pounded and blended with coriander, laksa leaf, Thai basil marinated in oyster sauce, fish sauce, Vietnamese Nuoc Cham sauce and a dab of chili padi (that\'s the kicker) before breaded and deep fried for the perfect complement to spicy Thai-inspired cocktail Golden Mile. Or just on its own. Really, it\'s that good. 😋
Blowing us away is this chicken coleslaw that tastes way better than it sounds. A far cry from the common American slaw of raw cabbage and mayo that we know of, this refreshing creation resembled an Asian-inspired cold chicken salad. Strips of tender chicken meat is tossed together in shredded red carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts, raw red onion, shallots, coriander and peanut, dressed in lashings of sesame oil that was all kinds of delicious. A portion of this is made to share, but it\'s so good one could easily finish it alone—I know I definitely could!
Very girly cocktails made up of calvados, elderflower liqueur, Thai spiced-poached pears and rose buds; and aged tequila, grilled pineapple, pomegranate molasses and pandan leaf, respectively!
Salt pepper squid strips with Vietnamese nuoc cham dip, which @joanlausc and I suspect was inspired by the Indian muruku, both in flavor and in texture. How clever...the dish, not us! | #food #instaweekend #foodcursion
It\'s anything but chendol, but once you combine everything, the flavour profile is almost exactly the same. I really love the gula Melaka jelly and the popcorn!
Southeast Asian-flavoured \'sausage\' encasing the gooey centred quail eggs – definitely one of my favourite dishes here!

🍴\n<br />•\n<br />On first look, it definitely looks different from your average meal and starters. The shell is made from Chinese Biscuits, but the overall taste was superb. We couldn\'t just have one! A unique experience in your mouth I must say. 👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />Located at Ding Dong, nearest MRT would be Telok Ayer. This will cost you around ($19+) per plate. 💸\n<br />•\n<br />Thank you @justinfoodprints for recommending this place for us to try out! 😱\n<br />•\n<br />Don\'t forget to #thegrowingbelly to share your meals with us! TGIF LETS GO AND CELEBRATE! 👏🏻\n<br />•\n<br />#fusion #scallops #unique
Previously, on Saturdays, Ding Dong only operates at night, but it\'s now opened for lunch too. Perfect excuse to check out their set lunch deal (available Mondays to Saturdays), which will only set you back $28++ for 2 courses, and $35++ for 3 courses.

Sure injects some life into the dead Amoy streets on a weekend morning after crazy #TGIF reveleries. The way I see things, this cheerful joint decked out in a splash of nostalgic colours and prints is perfect for girl gatherings and friendly banters over sweet cocktails.
A tad on the salty side but goes down terribly well with tipples from the new cocktail menu.

shall we try that?\" And so we did. This plate of Vietnamese Scotch Eggs (S$16) was the other highlight of the day other than our fanciful drinks. \n<br />The (pork) shell was crispy and succulent, which the quail egg with liquid yolk complemented it very well. The dish was full of Asian flavours, so did the Thai chilli sauce that went with it. \n<br />If you do want to pamper yourself, go ahead, you won\'t regret. \n<br />#vscocam #vscofood #instafood #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #sgfood #dingdong #dingdongSG #pubSG #SGpub #SGbar #SGrestaurant #restaurantSG #vietnamesescotchegg #quaileggs #eggs #asianfood #igsg #sgig #burpple #singapore #latergram
(the white cup) \n<br />My most adventurous attempt in an alcoholic drink. Haha. It was great and tasted like chendol, but with a kick of alcohol.

Char Siew, wagyu, cherry tomatoes, papaya will sound wrong on paper, but in the genius hand of the 27 year old Sabah native head chef at #dingdongsg , it not only works, it soars. The familiar glossy glaze of char Siew expertly applied on fork tender Waygu, and eaten with the pickled papaya and tomatoes, it just balances like a Russian ballerina right out of swan lake. What\'s more criminal beyond how tasty it gets is the chef has the audacity to plate it so immaculately with a beautiful modernistic touch. Sublime :)\n<br />#waygu #charsiew #pickledpapaya #cherrytomato #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodporn #burpple

Another winner
Another dish that I go wow. 
Not a scotch egg fan but this combo is wow. 
Strips with ease at the snap of my fingers and rockin\' a sweet spicy glaze that pairs perfectly with its flavorsome flesh. A paradisiacal dish for a languid monday。
Dive into this, with or without rice。

Would have loved for a more intense smoky flavour.
Such a feminine concoction of yoghurt sake, elderflower liqueur, fresh strawberries and yuzu liqueur. My favourite things in one bottle!
