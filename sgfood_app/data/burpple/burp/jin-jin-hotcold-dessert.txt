And \"power\" it wasn\'t.. The only thing that stood out about this cendol was that the gula melaka syrup was significantly thicker and reduced compared to that in other versions - and even that didn\'t necessarily go down as a good thing with my family because it only made the sweetness and rich flavour somewhat overpowering. I also prefer the larger, plumper red beans you can easily get in food courts these days. More liao pls.
This toffee-like gooey gula melaka fudge is really POWER lah! 😍 Combining forces with finely shaved ice and coconut milk, it\'s a winner. 😋
Power Chendol at $2 nett. The gula melaka sauce was too gooey like malt candy, and its taste too intense although it would be very shiok for people who like such heavy taste. Not worth the 15-min queue. Will try their durian mango ice next time. 
The gula melaka with honey like texture is way too good not to be shared. Can\'t remember when is the last time I had this kind of gao gao gula melaka in a chendol in Singapore. So good and so cheap. What is there not to love? Shiok shiok curry pok!
The queue was never-ending, even after lunch time. •
榴芒冰/Gangster Ice  and Power Chendol. The combination of durian and mango worked for my tastebuds but the rest felt that the sweet-sour combi was weird. The Power Chendol drenched in thick Gula Melaka syrup was sinfully satisfying. What a sinful night of hawker goodness! #hawkerpedia
“Liu Mang Bing” (Durian/ Mango Ice).  
Wouldn\'t mind having this right now. One of my favourite hawker desserts. That mango and durian! 😋
@2.5$ this is totally worthy of the queue/all the good reviews..... That scoop of durian along with the shaved ice and mango (that I suspected was soaked in 7 up or soda water) was a surprisingly an excellent combination! Mango being light , tangy and sweet while durian being rich in flavor! Super shiok and sedap 👍
Thick thick Gula Melaka. #likehotfudge Looks cannot make it but tastes SHIOKADOO!
Thick fudge gula melaka Power Chendol by Jin Jin Dessert, which is one of the featured menus at UHF - Ultimate Hawker Fest (UHF) taking place at Suntec Convention Centre Halls 401 and 402 on 22 November 2014, from 11am to 5pm. 
😁 Must try! That scoop of #Durian is so good! Mangoes can be SUPER sour at times though.\n<br />#Mango #Durian #Dessert #Ice #Burpple #EleGlutton ✌️
Fresh mangoes on shaved ice topped with a scoop of frozen durian flesh. BEST!
This is quite the tropical dessert, Durian + Mango ice shavings! They call this the Gangster 流氓 Liu Mang because its Liu Lian + Mang Guo @ Jin Jin Dessert Stall ABC Food Centre
Gangster ice to start the long weekend! :) mango pieces, one big scoop of real durian and I think condensed milk topping :) rich and heavenly!
probably the closest in taste to the peranakan cendols thats full of gula melaka. not bad for a hawker cendol :)
They call this Power Chendol. Pack with a chock full of beans, green worms, some atap seeds, topped with a ball of ice, drizzled with coconut milk and gula melaka. I don\'t know what makes this better than other chendols, but this is really quite power and costs $1.50 only. 👍
Even if it\'s a simple bowl of fresh mango shaved ice, Burpplers gotta do what we\'ve got to do.
This store has really become a favourite dessert place for me! I present to you: \"The Gangster Ice\"! Awesome scoop of Durian Puree on top of fresh Mango Ice! Sinfully Delicious indeed! :D
Owner is really innovative. Power chendol is power! Love their other types of desserts too.

Ok, that\'s all.
I made a trip to ABC Brickworks last Saturday and arrived around 8pm, and it was so easy to find where Jin Jin Dessert was located because of the long queue! The queue of 10-15 people still existed even at 9pm, which normally would beat the dinner crowd. The stall looked to be free only after 9.30pm. But since this is a dessert stall, queues moves pretty fast and I don\'t think the waiting time would exceed 30 minutes even during the peak hours. The price for various kinds of dessert starts from $1.50. Super cheap! I read many reviews saying that thier must-try desserts are Super Chendol and Ice Gangster(both $2.0), but gave up the latter as I don\'t like a durian....\n<br />I ordered Super Chendol $2.0 for myself and fell in love with it as soon as I tried one mouthful of the ice and coconut milk♡ This is something that I can only find in Singapore. Never saw this kind of dessert in Korea before. It could look similar to \'bingsu\', which is a popular Korean traditional dessert, as both are served in the form of ice + syrup + many other ingredients to add-on by choice. However the combination of the brown syrup and coconut milk is only available here in South East Asia, and they make chendol distinctive from bingsu. I\'ll surely be visiting for their Power Chendol soon! \n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #singaporefood #chendol #dessert #burpple #burpplesg #singapore #lifeislalala #hawkertour #abcbrickworks #싱가포르 #먹스타그램 #싱가포르맛집
This combo was better b\'cos the red rubies were just as good, crunchy chunks of chestnut coated with that thin red layer of chewy translucent starch.  #burpple #BurppleSG #dessertsg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #instafood_sg #instadessert #sgfoodies #sgfood #matcha #setheats #whati8today #foodgasm #foodieSG #foodieSG #sgeats #sgmakandiary #STFoodTrending #sgigfoodies #foodstagram #dessert #chendol #gulamelaka
Just look at that beautiful thick gooeyyy gula melaka that can possibly put any decadent chocolate fudge to shame! Everything was so on point except for the red beans which I wish could be softer. But, imperfection is beauty, isn\'t it?
And make that my favourite special order of red ruby ice + extra mango:) No such thing as those tiny, uniform red rubies with the too-thick tapioca flour coat; large chunky handmade red rubies with thin bouncy gelee coating are the 💣here. Together with those mangoes that are perenially sweet, one cannot ask for a more perfect combination 💛. #yummy #foodporn #foodgasm #burpple #foodpics #foodie #igfood #instafood #foodstagram #igfoodie #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgeats #eatoutsg #foodspotting #foodphotography #igdaily #picoftheday
