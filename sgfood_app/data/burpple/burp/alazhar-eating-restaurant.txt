Ordered a lot during peak hour so I expected service to be slow, but was amazed when they served all at a go within 8 minutes! Portions were huge too 😱 // Mee Pataya [$4.80], Heryali Tikka [$6], Butter Chicken Masala [$6], Plain Naan [$1.50], Romali Roti [$2], Mango &amp; Strawberry Lassi [$3.50 each]
Thank God for a nation of multi-ethnicity! Late lunch in between house visits at one of my favourite 24-hour joints. How\'s the angpow collecting going for everyone? 💰💰 
$1.50 for prata topped with an over-easy egg! The egg is inconsistent though, as I\'ve had a few experiences with over-cooked yolks here. Their Milo Dinosaur ($2.50) is great! Rich, chocolatey drink that is sore-throat inducing but probably worth that sacrifice.
Some may balk at the notion, but I really think maggi goreng is the kind of food that you can eat at any time of the day, even for breakfast. Love the one here, which fires up the tastebuds with lots of chilli padi. And how sexy is that egg yolk?! 
A classic favourite amongst local Singaporeans, loved by Malays, Indians, Chinese and even the expats. Portion was generous and the fried chicken was awesome. Value for money with the whole set under $5.
This dish served sizzling hot. The sauce,  Seafood, vegetables and the noodle blends perfectly. Yums .. Rate:👍
The cheese sauce thicken the entire flavor. \n<br />It was heavenly for the first few bites but he\'ll for the last few. \n<br />AL-AZHAR RESTAURANT, BUKIT TIMAH\n<br />11/11A Cheong Chin Nam Road (Opposite Bukit Timah Shopping Ctr)\n<br />Tel: 6466 5052\n<br />NEVER CLOSE!

It was quite an surprise meal. You don\'t see any kind of this around Singapore. Imagine eating Murtabak and Pizza and the same time? Ya, should give it a try!

My standard fare at Al Azhar. Prata Kosong and Prata Egg. #singaporehawker #instafood #foodstagram
Plaster Prata. For those unfamiliar with Indian food, \"roti prata\", as it\'s called in Singapore, are sheets of dough fried on a hot griddle. It can be eaten plain or \"filled\" with ingredients like cheese, egg and/or mushrooms. A good prata should have crisp surfaces charred in spots, with a slightly chewy texture beneath. This is a perfectly done Plaster Prata, which is like an overeasy egg delicately sandwiched in dough. #prata #rotiprata #plaster #egg #overeasy #indianfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
naan\'s best friend ever - butter chicken. my fav gravy to eat with any flvoured naan. love the creaminess and spicyness and the richness of the gravy. goes so well with naan.

Both the fish and rice should have been fried longer for more crisp and wok hei, though I still finished a good portion of it.

Butter chicken is too sweet 👎
I think that\'s only true provided we still have the ability to eat well 😒 #desperatetoeat #metalmouth\n<br />#lifeisdelicious #indiancuisine #burpple #openricesg #eatoutsg #pickatsg
$0.50 each, reminds me of the $0.10 ones I had back in Bangkok ✈️#lifeisdelicious #satay #burpple #openricesg #eatoutsg #pickatsg
It\'s my 2nd time here &amp; it seems like I don\'t have any satay-luck both times 😅, though perhaps that\'s a blessing in disguise if not we would\'ve probably died stuffing ourselves.
Mutton masala is ups👍 enough for a non-mutton lover 😁
Thought it was a small serving.
I\'m gonna miss these late #prata nights. And that\'s one hell of a murtabak!
Garlic naan with chicken tikka masala. Not too garlicky. #burpple
