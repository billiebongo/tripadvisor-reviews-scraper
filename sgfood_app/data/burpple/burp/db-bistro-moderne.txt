anatomy of legendary db burger in full glory - epic ball patty of medium rare sirloin burger wrapped with red wine infused braised short ribs and a block of foie gras on a parmesan bun. is all in the craft and the incredible quality of ingredients in this burger i tell you.
Pretty flavourful, but at that price point I\'d have expected it to be less tough. Mushrooms and bacon also felt overly salty. 
The main reason I went down to DB was to try these as they are only available during weekend brunch.The profiteroles are served with a slab of chocolate on top. Warm chocolate is then poured over until the slab crumbles and melts all over the waiting profiteroles below. \n<br />It\'s chocolate rain!!!!\n<br />Oh What I would do to bathe in rich dark chocolate!\n<br />Ok it was kinda gimmicky. But I\'m a sucker for desserts. The dessert itself was not fantastic but it was worth watching the process. \n<br />Monster is a tourist in his own country. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Enough with the description let\'s move on to how it tastes. \n<br />This gets my all juices flowing, from the charred crispy cheese ends right to the gratifying meaty core. \n<br />Monster\'s first Croque Madame is all that he thought it would be. Like a fairy tale ending. \n<br />And Monster lived Happily ever after\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
It is a herbaceous perennial growing from short, thick rhizomes. \n<br />In other words it is full of nutrients and makes for a great dessert flavor. \n<br />Now you know! \n<br />Monster is learning the vegetable alphabet\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Or just an angry, sad person who doesn\'t want happiness. There\'s peanut butter ice cream (such joy), peanut brittle, chocolate truffle with a smooth centre, and lots of fluffy whipped cream. Chocolate sauce too. One word: ambrosial. Ok, that\'s all.
Toasted marshmallows sandwiched between two slices of graham crackers and then topped with chocolate cream and truffles, chocolate discs and salted caramel ice cream. Party in my mouth. Ok, that\'s all.
Desserts (at another restaurant down the road) were the saving grace of the evening. This gorgeous rhubarb vacherin was so elegant in flavours and textures. Hidden underneath the layers of vanilla and strawberry meringue was a luxurious quenelle of Sauternes-rhubarb ice cream. So lush, so silky, so aromatic. Ok, that\'s all.
The Original db Burger has a huge chunk of sirloin steak filled with braised short ribs and stuffed with foie gras slapped with Parmesan buns. It comes with a generous portion of chunky fries accompanied with their signature condiments.
I enjoy this moment with friends. Thanks for the great treat and company. 
It\'s a juicy, thick slab of patty wrapped around a foie gras center. On first bite you feel the red juices flowing down your tongue. As you reach the center portion, the creamy fatty foie gras coats your tongue in its riches. The garlic chili mustard sauce was a nice surprise. Wonder if I could get a bottle of it. \n<br />It\'s a decadent indulgence only possible once a blue moon. \n<br />Monster loves his meat juicy! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Best lamb Ive ever tasted! Tender meat with a perfectly grilled outter layer! 
Can\'t be called a dinner cause the portions were huge and I everything was so yummeh üç∑
This was really fun. There were many different textures in a mouthful. The crisp meringue and cream mixed with the hot strawberry sauce, and there were hidden marshmallows inside as well. A pretty finale to the otherwise disappointing meal.
When the king and queen of fruits come together. I prefer more durian taste but my friend said it was just right for him. The mangosteen sorbet complimented the souffle so it wasnt too jelat. 
Any talk of the best burger in Singapore is bound to bring up db Bistro Moderne. One look at the Original db Burger ($42) and you\'ll know they mean business. It\'s a 1.5-inch-thick sirloin patty filled with braised short ribs and foie gras, served on a Parmesan bun. One (hugeass and impossible) bite into the burger and you\'ll find that the patty is cooked just right, retaining its juices and texture while providing decadence in the form of premium ingedients. Such indulgence is befitting of the most expensive burger in town, save this for a special occasion with your loved ones!
So much to love about this salad! The thick slice of olive-loaded bread, very fresh greens and a light, creamy dressing all went very well with the tuna (not reeking of brine üëç). The addition of anchovy or herring (honestly couldn\'t tell) was the best part of the salad for me because its saltiness made everything taste so. much. more. 
I\'ve given many cooked salmon mains a try when dining out and as with beef, there just aren\'t many places that are able to nail it. The chef at db though, he got it all right this day - a moist fillet and crispy, salty salmon skin, fingerling potatoes and warm cherry tomatoes, basil pistou and lemon-chicken jus - thank goodness for online menus - everything. EVERYTHING was done right in this one. Kinda makes me afraid to return for more now I\'m worried I won\'t get to enjoy the same experience as I had hehe!
Not the smoothest panna cotta I\'ve had but what it lacked in texture it made up for in the flavours served in this trio of sorbet, vanilla panna cotta and mixed berries/pur√©e. I\'m a sucker for vanilla and berries so I shan\'t go any further there. The lemon sorbet, however, was so gooood. I don\'t like lemon flavoured food in particular but this sorbet didn\'t contain that \"Mama Lemon\"-synthetic lemon syrup after-taste and was sprightly, to say the least, in its icy-sour mix. The only other time I remember having a similar experience with lemon sorbet was the one served at Taratata Bistro, another French bistro down at Keong Saik St :)
A good red-wine sauce and smokey pork belly saved this dish from becoming almost subpar compared to the rest of the dishes we had. I mean, the chicken wasn\'t done badly. It was a little too clean in taste for my liking, so the sauce made a good cover up. The sauce was great because it doesn\'t taste like a sauce where you can\'t tell there\'s red wine in it. No I\'m not saying it\'s extremely strong in wine flavour either but the point is, it\'s not a FLAT sauce. Like the kind you know is pre-made with tons of preservatives and frozen for keeps and as you taste it you only taste one kind of flavour. As I savoured every mouthful, I sensed I was eating more than just a chicken-in-sauce. At least this was what I remember of the dish, and I\'d recommend it to anyone who\'s thinking of giving it a try. 
A great medium-rare beef patty in this one. Well-seasoned (yes!!! Finally found THE seasoned burger!!), and yes, although it is always advised to order a patty well done, I guess we\'ll always love the medium-rare order, bacteria or not :x The patty\'s stuffed with foie gras which wasn\'t totally necessary BUT got \'good food won\'t complain\', heheheh...
I enjoyed every part of the set lunch/es we had, including this appetiser of Pork Terrine and pickled greens. This starter came with it\'s own bread but it was better on its own! (The complimentary bread served before the meal though, was a different storyüòçüòçÔºâ
Loved this steak tartare. Simply because the beef was diced, not minced, to a good size which allowed for small bites while retaining that chunk-of-beef feel in the mouth. The marinade, together with the red onion slices created a great-tasting mix of flavours. A soft-boiled egg was served atop the steak and gave the steak an even goo-ier, slimier texture which oooh~tingled my senses:) 
Tossed fresh crunchy lettuce with juicy sweet tomatoes, boiled potatoes and crunchy asparagus in a mix of olive oil, lemon and light salad dressing. Top with touch of thinly sliced radish and 3 different types of tuna. And not forgetting the fragrant slice of baguette spread with olive pate at the side. Personally this is exactly how I like my salad. It\'s make me happy just to have this as a light lunch on any weekday. This dish comes as of the salad selection the lunch set (45 for 2 course meal).
All the pasta here are handmade so they really taste different. I like that the penne here have a smooth texture and thinner compared to usual ones. It just kinda holds on more sauce and blends better :p Aside from the heavenly truffle fragrant I really like how the chef baked the cheese and parsley, it\'s almost like having a thin crust that adds on to the texture of every bite. Just like how it\'s done. :) if you are lucky - this comes as one of the choice if main in the lunch set; notice that the mains change weekly. So catch it while you can ya! This place offers great service and they always made an effort to remember you. Perfect for a getaway lunch on weekday and Great place for dinner too. 
Tis\' the season of black truffles. Underneath 3 grams shaved truffles, are perfectly cooked scallops. üëç #nom #truffle
Durian Souffl√©. Very light, fluffy, and not overpowering in flavour. Loved the mangosteen ice cream, a perfect complement in the tropical composition. #souffle #icecream #durian #tropical #dessert #sweet #sugarhigh #frenchfood #sgfood #foodporn
Coq au Vin. Red wine-braised chicken with shallots, pork, mushrooms and fettucine. Probably the only main that I thought had good, rich flavour. #chicken #coqauvin #pasta #meat #frenchfood #foodporn #sgfood
The Frenchie Burger. Beef patty with cheese, pickles and confit pork belly. Terribly disappointing recipe, coming from a chef who earned his Michelin stars in America - the beef was way under-seasoned and was completely masked by the saltier pork belly. Only thing I liked was the garlic aioli served with the fries. \n<br />#burger #fries #beef #pork #foodporn #sgfood
Duck Confit. For a French restaurant, I must say this was sadly underwhelming. Meat was too dry and tough. Oh, how I miss Paris. #duck #duckconfit #meat #frenchfood #foodporn #sgfood
Crispy Pork Belly. Gloriously fatty chunks of meat tempered with French beans, lettuce and chopped cashews. #pork #porkbelly #salad #foodporn #frenchfood #sgfood

Sirloin burger, filled with braised short ribs &amp; foie gras, served on Parmesan bun.
I haven\'t had a freshly made pasta that tasted so bad. Very disappointed.
Did a farewell dinner for colleagues. And was introduced to 4 items. DB burger (sirlion and foiegras) duck confit, roast pork and the seafood platter. All 3 are worth the price and the tastebuds are celebrating. $$
so-so for my taste, others find this awesome.\n<br />taste is subjective, not personal...\n<br />chicken braised and cooked in red wine, garnished w pearl onions, bacon, mushrooms, and farfalle pasta.
The duck confit was perfectly presented in the mini cast iron casserole - soft and delicate aqua bird texture topped with sweet caramelized onions. So much better than the famed Coq Au Vin swear by many. I gave it a 4.5/5.0 verdict! 
Out of this world! Bite-size soft spongy interior with some crisps exterior was so moreish. Buttery but not overtly heavy, it\'s a must have dessert to end your meal at the bistro. 20s warm teeny madeleines top my dessert choice at db Moderne bistro every time! S$8/basket, it wasn\'t too much to ask for ya!! Try them out!!
Lunch time dessert porn: \"Apple Tarte Fine\". Beautiful rounded puff pastry with cognac ice cream over it. Apple compote in the side.
Cabilleaud Poch√©. Poached Cod, Fish Mousse Quenelles, Sauce Nantua (crayfish butter) with Snow Peas and Baby Carrots. I LOVE the sauce!!
Fav first course: Plateau De Charcuterie. Cured Meats, Duck Terrine, Homemade Pickles.

The enormous sirloin patty was filled with braised short ribs &amp; foie gras, sandwiched between a tasty parmesan bun. The sheer thickness of the patty had impressed before I sank my teeth into it to taste some beautiful juicy flavours with much satisfaction.

And what better way than to go for their largest Royal size that\'s good for 5-6 persons. But we decided to finish these up amongst just 4 of us and we were absolutely satisfied!

Each tender morsel brought happiness to my taste buds. Don\'t forget the best part is the lobster which is the sauce from the head, totally sinful and indulgent!
You know see chunks of foie gras, flecks of truffle and pieces of slab bacon that it would be a good meal ahead. Now, this is how I would like to enjoy this, Slather the Pate, Bite-Chew-Bite once more and Indulge, repeat process until everything disappears from the plate.
