The soup is bursting with flavour and the meat is super tender! 
Braised Pig\'s Trotters was not bad too, a little too fat but still very fragrant and tasty, and @furreen mentioned she tasted chestnuts in this dish (?!) which was quite interesting. Is that their secret ingredient? But I still miss the ones in Bangkok, accompanied with pig\'s intestines. I\'m already salivating thinking of that!
I really like Bak Kut Teh! This one had really tasty soup and was quite addictive but it wasn\'t peppery enough (for the 3 of us) and I thought the meat was a little too tough. But way better than many other versions of this dish I had tried!
Bak Kut Teh just now in the afternoon. I wasn\'t standing on a chair that\'s why I couldn\'t capture everything 😂
Stay tuned for what was the actual real dinner in the next post!\n<br />•\n<br />The flagship outlet with an impressive wall mural that’s covered with photographs of celebrities both local and overseas who travelled all the way to Founders for a bowl of their peppery pork bone soup. Still the best in Singapore for me.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Founder Bak Kut Teh\n<br />Address: 347, Balestier Road, Singapore 329777\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock #founderbkt #bakkutteh
