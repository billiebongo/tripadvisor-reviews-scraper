Dim sum dinner at Wan Dou Sek (126) in Geylang, featuring the delicious non-dim sum dish, Salt baked garlic crab tang hoon ($18), alongside the usual and more than satisfactory dishes of carrot cake and siew mai, which are all very reasonably priced. Interesting notes: Their Chee cheong fun comes with thick gravy instead of the usual soy sauce dressing. Also, their drinks come in huge plastic containers LOL! #dimsum #burpple
amongst all, I love that claypot of duck porridge \n<br />keeping one eye on de future. let\'s hope all goes well.
I heard it used to be good... I\'m not going back anymore.
So much different variety of dim sum here with good taste

Salty, no soup. Basically a pork dumpling.
Meh.
Pillowy-soft buns with a sweet, hearty, meaty char siew filling. Ahhhhh i miss it already. I would return just for this.
Measly, non-molten and honestly rather disappointing
This 叉烧肠粉 is one of the best in town and definitely deserved a shout out. The uniqueness of this dish is the sauce they use, not your normal soya sauce finishing. Price at $3.80.
One of the many staples in a typical Chinese family, porridge easily makes yet another all-time comfort food here in Singapore. Although I don\'t fancy one, this is pretty good. Priced at $2.80. 
Man tou with chilli crab sauce. Mmm crispy but sauce is not as flavourful as the real deal
Fried Thai style crab dong fen. $15 for small, extremely good with heavy garlic and pepper flavours.
Supplier treated us to yummy \"bao\" on Friday! Generous amount of filling 😍👍
Fresh good okie...  Be prepared to wait awhile during lunch n dinner times... 
The sauce\'s pretty unique 
Reminds me of awesome childhood kaya buns at Sunday dim sums in Brunei 
Generous scallop portions (both fresh and dried) with a congee texture. The sesame oil helps with the overall taste too.
This 24 hour, always packed hk style eatery has an extensive menu with some really creative items. 
Our dinner dim sum spread: Spare rib in spicy Szechuan sauce, steamed shrimp rice flour roll, har kao (shrimp crystal dumpling), siew mai (pork dumpling), char siew bao (bbq pork bun), fan-choy (flavored pork rice) . Yummy! 🙊🙊🙊
Ordered prawn chee cheong fan, char siew bao, liu sha bao, and fried scallop. Their dim sum is definitely worth a try, however the honey lemon tea tastes weird. Spent about $10 per pax ;)
Don\'t order this. 
Starchy gravy that tastes much better than it looks.
Very sinful but yummy.
126 @ 2AM; nothing much left so we had 6x5 chixwings!!! (NTA: 126 will be closed from 4-14 Feb)
They offer large varieties of Dim Sum at a very affordable price. Although they may not taste the best, it is definitely value for money. Of all the dishes, the Century Egg and Minced Pork porridge was the best, it was both sweet and savoury, and comes in a huge portion! It is the supper spot to visit before having a good night sleep! They open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week so they will always be there for you!\n<br />⚊\n<br />📍126 Dim Sum\n<br />126 Sims Avenue, Singapore 387449\n<br />⚊\n<br />✏#JaeplusKaeReviews\n<br />▪\n<br />💻 JaeplusKae.wordpress.com\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />#igsg #sg #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodporn #whati8today #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodgram #food #foodie #instafood #foodblog #foodblogger #feedfeed #먹스타그램 #먹방 #vscocam #dimsum #chinese
Their 明虾角, 虾肠粉 and 烧卖王 is a must order here!! 😍
Hands down, this place is my favorite Dim Sum place in Singapore. If you don\'t mind noisy, cramped and a non-posh setting, this is the place for you! It\'s a bit pricey but definitely worth the price :)

🙅🏽 However, I think the standard of the #dimsum has dropped since the last time I ate around 3 years ago? 🤔
😩🤓 Still my Favourite after so many years [Prawn Chee Cheong Fun S$3.80]
It\'s not that it tastes bad but the ones I had in my school canteen was much better. The aunty at the shop used to pack it up in a plastic bag for me and my friends then we would just eat it while we were playing soccer! Many interesting stuffs happened but those were the times man.😌\n<br />👇🏻\n<br />Hashtag #sgfoodiary to share your daily eats with our food community and get a chance to be featured!🙆\n<br />👇🏻\n<br />#126 #fanchoy #burpple
Their Chilli sauce really makes a big difference. #Dimsum #126dimsum
Crowded eatery which serves decent dim sum at reasonable pricing.. Menu is overflowing with options and you would be spoilt for choice.. Ample parking space is available and the eatery blast their air con at max power so you won\'t feel the afternoon heat at all.. #jinhojiak #foodporn #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodie #latergram #burpple #20151010
Finally got to eat this after so long... my verdict: nicer than swee choon! Ambience feeling so hongkong &amp; authenic though kinda squeezy! Was lucky didnt need to wait too long... #brunch #brunchtime #dimsum #dimsumsg #sgfood #126dimsum #geylang #wandousek #24hrsdimsum #simsavenue #saturdate #qiangxxuan #withlove #withmyoldman #fondmemories #sgig #igsg #igdaily #igfood #localfood #localdelights #burpplesg #burpple #food #foodporn #搵到食 #点心
The items here are hits and misses, no need to travel here but I\'d say my 1km walk from my home late at night is worth it.
Still prefer Victor\'s Kitchen\'s rendition. The fried scallops were a hit!
Lime juice with sour plum is totally da bomb.
yummy affordable dim sum with a splash of HK ambience! 
Tasted like Rosti lol.\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
Comfort food..

My favourite.
