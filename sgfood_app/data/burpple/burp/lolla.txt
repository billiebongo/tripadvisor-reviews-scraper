As this came highly recommended by Jayne Tan whose taste I trust implicitly, ordering it was a no-brainer.\n<br />The sensuous combination of the grilled avocado\'s softened creaminess with feta cheese, a crunchy pine nut crumble and refreshingly crisp pickled fennel was swoon-worthy to say the least. The fennel sauce wasn\'t the kind that shouts but I fully appreciated its quiet yet vital presence. \n<br />A must-order if you are an avo fiend like me.
Found this special on Lolla\'s Sunday brunch menu. The porcini mushrooms, saut√©ed with a few paper-thin slices of garlic in white wine, were really juicy. But I feel the brilliant touch was smothering them in toasted quinoa. Those tiny grains enhanced the dish with a delicate smokiness and crunchiness. 
A special of the day, the grilled purple brocollini was beautifully crisp and subtly savoury from a touch of kombu butter. I swiped each stem in the smooth vanilla cauliflower pur√©e and soft, gooey egg before popping it in my month. Sublime combination.
Fried together with the shredded pieces of beef tongue (which tasted just like corn beef) were cubes of potato, saut√©ed onions, softened baby tomatoes and a bit of red chilli. A sunny-side-up egg sat on top, ready to be cut and mixed in with the hash.\n<br />An appetising dish for sure but in my opinion, a little too pricey, especially for the portion. 
Not too many Sundays ago, this dish of scrambled eggs was one of the brunch items we shared at Lolla.\n<br />Because of the Bottarga di Muggine (salted and cured fish roe) included, it was a little pungent in terms of smell and taste, but in a good way if you get what I mean. Definitely an interesting change from the usual.
I can\'t say no to good toast and this ticks all the boxes. The three smoke-scented, crunchy-crusted, soft-and-chewy slices of sourdough are spread with hazelnut butter, then smothered in a sweet and tart rhubarb conserve, and finally crowned with a blob of creamy ricotta and bits of fresh basil. Because the bread radiates heat from being fresh off the grill, everything seems to meld into a glorious mess quite rapidly. I actually like that üòÑ
Besides looking visually spectacular, Lolla impressed us with this deep and intense appetizer that made us wowed. The flavours of the sea urchin and squid ink pudding hit us strong like a tsunami, we were breathing, savouring and drowning in the taste of ocean. üòÅ
Don\'t be put off by the black pudding, even if you\'re on a date. Your tastebuds will thank you for it a thousand times over. The full portion ($42) is around the size of my palm, and that first bite of creamy uni and umami pudding is good enough to bring you to tears. Now I know what the hype about this is all about, a must order when you come here.
My wife enjoyed this a lot. So I\'ll be ordering this the next time we come!
|\n<br />The dish which trademarked Lolla. If you haven\'t had this dish in Lolla, means you never been to Lolla! .\n<br />|\n<br />Despite of its size, the burst of seafood-y flavor blasted through my entire palate. Totally no trace of any smelly seafood taste. .\n<br />|\n<br />The squid ink pudding combo with sea urchin. It was so good that I couldn\'t bare to swallow it!
|\n<br />The most comforting dish of the day. Semi deep fried potato with stewed beef tongue. Loved the idea of frying the potato, beef tongue and sun dried tomato together. The ingredients balanced with each other and created a soothing harmony. .\n<br />|\n<br />Break the yolk and eat it. So goooooooooooood!
|\n<br />Super smelly blue cheese baked omelette. Either you love it or hate it. The added spring onion help to add some sweetness. However, the chef might had added too muuuuuuch salt.
|\n<br />Another prefect dish. Couldn\'t remember what\'s inside. But the unforgivable char grill bits gave the squid a depth of flavors. It was effortless for my teeth to bite through the squid. The filling gave more texture and allowed the squid to stay a little longer in my mouth. üòçüòçüòç
|\n<br />Something to refresh our taste bud. The radishes tasted almost like baby Apple. Good crisp and helped to cleanse the palate.
|\n<br />Looked plain and simple. Even when I was able to cut through with my fork, I still didn\'t felt any special. However, the moment it touched my palate, the taste of crab would explode. The taste hovered through and forth my taste bud. Totally didn\'t expected it to be this good! ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
|\n<br />Good starter for our brunch at Lolla. Instead of the usual salted butter, the saltiness from Kombu (seaweed) was more natural. With this spread, we finished the sourdough in minutes. .\n<br />|\n<br />Maybe we took a while to take pictures which resulted the sourdough to be a little hard.
This doughnut with lemon curd ($12++). The doughnut material taste like some atas \"hum ji peng\" (those fries pastry you get at the pastry stalls that is sometimes 3 for $2) I don\'t really like the lemon curd and doughnut combination. The lemon curd is too sour. Haha I\'m so picky. Xoxo, wet tissue no have
This dish is call \"Iberian pork collar\" on the menu. (I googled, Iberian is like some southwest part of Europe). The server told me this is their most popular dish-- to a degree that it\'s a must-have after the sea urchin starter. The meat is really really tender and it has a char Siew sauce sweetness infused in it. The accompanying sauce taste like McDonald\'s chilli sauce but no spicy taste at all. The combination is perfect! The price tag for this European char Siew is $29++. Xoxo, wet tissue no have 
Order this because one of the burpple\'s pictures featuring this looked so good!! Although this was not features as the TOP recommendation, I really like this and I highly recommend this. The grilled avocado is topped with breadcrumbs, pine nuts and sour creme~ perfect combination. The grilling process brings out a different char taste. The only thing I dislike about the dish is the price tag ($17++). Table spoon beside for reference. Lol xoxo, wet tissue no have 
The sea urchin that keep appearing on my feed. Finally tried the half portion. It\'s a unique taste of sweetness, sourness and saltiness of fish roe all in one mouth with a very thick texture. Half portion cost ($22++). This one sort of tried for trying seek. Please note that portion is very small. The dessert spoon on the background is for reference. Xoxo, wet tissue no have
Would you believe, this dish has gotten even better since the last time I had did? Chock-full of crab meat and smothered in a sauce so divine, this is a must have at brunch. It is very rich, so please share between 2-3! 
Honestly, the food at @lollasg does not need fancy descriptions. It is what it is, and it is freaking awesome. \n<br />#lollasg #burpple
I have wronged you in the past. You are the brightest star in the night sky and you have anchored your place in my heart. \n<br />#lollasg #burpple
Brilliant sole fish and might as well (we get) the whole fish. Not surprising that we can devour the whole fish (and 2 other dishes) by just me and my partner. It\'s because the butter fan frying is done to the perfect doneness, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside! No additional seasoning needed so you can taste the natural sweetness of the fish. Note worthy are the capers, fried with butter (and salted?) which adds the savory flavours to the fish.
A dish I never failed to order since my first encounter here. It only taste better.
This gorgeous shophouse along Ann Siang Road has the perfect setting for that special meal. Be sure to make reservations for a table, but try your luck to get a seat at the counter to watch the chefs at work. If not, dine at the beautifully-lit communal table downstairs, it is one that allows you to have an intimate conversation while enjoying the convivial ambience Lolla offers. Order a bottle of wine, and start with the humble Tomato Salad ($15); the uber fresh, plump, sweet tomatoes (they change seasonally) are dressed simply in olive oil, parsley, and olive soil. Then, move on to the mind-blowing Sea Urchin &amp; Squid Ink Pudding ($22 for a half portion, good for 2 pax) ‚Äî a velvety-smooth pudding topped with uni so fresh and creamy it transports you to the sea. If you have any fear of offal, this unbelievably tasty Beef Tripe ($23) might just change your mind. It is first braised to pack in flavour, then grilled over charcoal to provide crisp edges and a good hit of smokiness. End your meal with light-as-air Doughnuts with Lemon Curd ($12).
Creamy and perfectly scrambled. $22. Bottarga went very nicely with the egg. 
Fresh and rich with the sweetness of the sea. A must try! 
I remember being forced awake at 5AM so that we could meander our way over to the Sydney Fish Market to pick up 6oz for breakfast.
This arrived on our bar top table looking very tantalizing with the char grilled outer layer. Give the lime a squeeze and I perfectly love how this acidity touch Iifts the entire taste. The octopus could be softer but the bite on the octopus releases more sweetness from the meat! 
An oven baked gratin filled with a layer of melted cheese above the heavy cream and generous strands of leek cooked till mushy. The sweetness from the leeks came through and is an ultimate comfort food! Be sure to catch it while it\'s still warm and a spoonful of all the layers will definitely make you crave for more. 
Fresh uni served atop squid ink pudding - visually pleasing with that bright yellow against black. While the squid ink had a very rich and strong seafood flavor which would tend to mask the sweetness of the uni, the combination of these 2 creamy texture actually satisfy my taste buds very much! It\'s a good starter while waiting for the rest of the dishes to be served! 
Not just any butter, this is kombu butter ‚Äì simply divine. Slather a thick chunk of this house-made butter on a thick slice of warm and toasty grilled bread. Its umami, buttery sweetness will make you yearn for more ‚Äì even if you (think you) are too full for another bite. 
Not just any pudding, this is The (most raved about) uni pudding. Fresh briny sea urchin sits atop a wobbly mass of rich squid ink pudding. It\'s all sorts of luxury in a bite. 
This dish is a must-try when you dine at lolla. It\'s super creamy and pricey, but worth every penny 
Doneness was perfectly medium raw. Although I would think the sweetness is not coming through. Good that it\'s served with wilted sweet onion.
Usually tripe is braised but this grilled tripe with sauce is great. It\'s both crispy yet soft. Great. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 11
A good starter though a bit too filling. Creamy smooth Uni with squid ink pudding beneath. Yummy. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 11
Fresh and sweet tomatoes to start a meal. Really refreshing. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 11
The avocado is halved and grilled in the charcoal grill before topping off with sour cream, bread crumbs and pine nuts. It could well stop there, as the introduction of pickled radish and a tangy dressing gave it a less welcoming twist.
The most impressive ingredients were not mentioned in the menu. Loved their potatoes so much. Soft and creamy with that potato umami that makes this stands out amongst the many tapas dishes here. The sausage is \"deskined\" and pinched into irregular-shaped meat balls. The sundried tomatoes and Italian parsley gave this dish the sunny Mediterranean flavours in the cooking at this hot grill restaurant.
You are not going to miss this for the world... even the NDP can wait (oops). I\'m sure Lolla is now synonymous with this dish and that\'s what pops up when you google either of these words. Having waited longer than I would with trying this delicacy would be what I am really regretting. That said I am not a big uni fan until I tasted it served at Niji (now closed). This pudding made of mainly squid ink, egg yolk, cream and tomato pur√©e really lives up to expectations. Even my partner whom I would never imagine her taking uni, said it gives this appetizer a unique flavor that is hard to describe...\"Ummmmph, I\'d need another spoonful to tell you\" she quipped.
The creamy Angel Hair with slow cooked egg is ultimate brunch. Special on the menu, it is finished with winter truffle and aged parmesan.¬†
With black squid ink...  Not really my kind but it\'s good nevertheless
Squid ink pudding was rich, creamy and smooth, and the sea urchin added a little fresh taste of the sea
Juicy medium rare slices of steak with a beautiful char, paired with a caramelized onion jam. Smoky, succulent and sweet, a carnivore could not ask for more.
My friends, however, did find the pudding to be too salty and \'gelat\'. The donuts had a thin perfectly fried crust enveloping a molten custard-like centre, so good even without the tart lemon curd dip. This iberico pork collar was pretty good too, even though pork is seldom cooked medium rare, but the meat was succulent with a nice char surrounding it. My friends liked the tomato salad as well, but were disappointed by the less than stellar scrambled eggs. #Burpple
Can\'t get enough of these pillowy balls of fluffy deep-fried goodness everytime I\'m back here. Swipe them in the incredibly tart and tangy sweet lemon curd before popping them for an explosion of textures and intense flavour in your mouth. Baller!
If you love uni, then this pudding is a MUST have. Some may find this a little too rich for their liking so you might want share with somebody else. Hard core uni lovers can opt for the bigger version with more sea urchin tongues. 
Velvety in texture and the deepest brown in colour, this pudding was fashioned from Valrhona Guanaja 70% chocolate and topped with crunchy bits of chocolate for texture. I threw myself into its decadent depths without any hesitation. Bliss! 
It\'s been a while but this dessert is as heavenly as I remember. Made only when you order, the donuts are served hot. Amazingly, they are as soft, light and fluffy as balls of cloud. A dab of that lovely lemon curd lifted them to something even more.
This is only for dark chocolate fans!! Good thing they serve a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance it.
Order this (proper name on menu is the Iberico pork collar)! Awesome chunky fatty pork, grilled to perfection. Zesty paper thin green apple slices and drizzled with beetroot(?) sauce. Slightly sweet and charsiew-like. 
different from normal tripe as they grill it until slightly crispy after braising. the tomato based moirepoix (?) didn\'t do much for me though. tripe is already rich and you just can\'t pair it with another mushy thing.
Would have preferred less pudding and more urchin. LOL. But seriously, the squid ink pudding is super jelak and kind of overpowers the urchin. If you order the full portion you will regret it. 
This is absolutely amazeballs! I had this thrice on separate occasions and it is still consistently delicious. The other foods on the menu are as palatable and flavourful too. 
Nothing beats having doughnuts made fresh upon order. These boast a lovely light crunch on the outside and a light-as-air centre. A generous dollop of the zesty lemon curd completes the gastronomic trip-out.
A signature dish of Lolla\'s, this deserves all the accolades it\'s received. Fresh sea urchin (or uni) is heaped on top of a slightly firm black squid-ink custard. Superb.
Steam chocolate cake anyone? Review of Lolla up on blog! Www.ms-skinnyfat.com #chocolate #dessert #sgfood
This gorgeous shophouse gives you the option of sitting at the counter to watch the wonders of an open kitchen, or the beautifully lit basement communal table. Order a bottle of wine, and start with the mind-blowing Sea Urchin &amp; Squid Ink pudding. As Burppler Jibs puts it perfectly, \'I can only tell you to try for yourself to know what it means to be lost for words at a dish like this.\' Be adventurous and go for the Beef Tripe, it is unbelievably tasty and crispy on the edges. Finish off with the light-as-air doughnuts, and you\'re in for a great night. 
I don\'t recall ever having beef tripe, so to me this was a first. The braised beef tripe was crispy on the outside, and the inside reminded me of fats (the kind which you\'d try your bestest to avoid but tastes so darn good). I chose to believe that this was definitely higher in nutritional value than fats. This was beef tripe. And it was good.
For those who have been to Lolla, the sea urchin (not itching! dammit, autocorrect) pudding needs no introduction. For those who haven\'t been, this dish cannot be described with mere words. It is that sensation, that exquisite delight, that smooth, pure uni-goodness that slides down your throat, and so much more. I can only tell you to try it for yourself to know what it means to be lost for a words at food like this.

Steamed dark chocolate pudding with vanilla ice cream. Intense cocoa flavours complimented by milder vanilla bean ice cream.
Sea urchin pudding. Black pudding made with squid ink, egg yolk, cream and tomato paste. Extremely rich and decadent- must try.
Hearty tapas done really really well. Great friendly service too. Standout dishes are the sea urchin pudding (if only they sold it as a spread, I\'ll cover everything with it!), the ox tongue escalopes and baguette with tomato and toasted garlic. 4.5 nombles.
Our lovely hosts in Germany treated us to this GIGANTIC pizza dinner.:)
Smooth custard that isn\'t overly sweet, with a caramelised top that cracks at the lightest tap!
The umami flavours in this cheese made using cow\'s milk is reminiscent of bacon. So intriguingly delicious!
This incredibly rich and velvety smooth savoury squid-ink pudding topped with creamy sea urchin did not disappoint at all. The addition of finely-chopped chives gives this dish a much-needed lift. So, so, sooooo goood! 
Pork n Peach! \'twas one of the specials last night. Beautiful n rich flavours. Peach slice could\'ve been bigger for better balance of richness. Couldn\'t finish last piece- too full! :(
\"Eggs Sunny Side Up\" with chorizo iberico. The chorizo iberico was Too intensely salty for my liking but guys seems to like it. I liked the potatoes! 
Toasted baguette, tomatoes, roasted garlic. Sauce was cold which was surprising but I warmed up to it ;)
Duck Rillettes with a crunchy toasted baguette! Perfect portion. Love this one even more than the one they do at Bistro du vin. 
I decided to pick the one thing that baffled me most on the menu- Sea Urchin Pudding or \'the Uni\'. Blew my freakin\' mind.

But.. BUT...these pillowy balls with a fluffy and feathery texture (like choux) really worth the calories. #MissNeverfull_SG
The freshly grilled lamb rack with a pink center tastes exactly as succulent as it looks. #MissNeverfull_SG
It was a lovely time spent with @theshutterwhale before I leave Singapore for a long while, hope to catch up with you somewhere soon!
I love this dessert...  A must try
Cooked just right a must try
Fried in duck oil...  Its tantalisingly wonderful
But nevertheless it\'s nice!
I had to stop myself coz it\'s addicting. These deep fried goodness dipped in tangy, buttery and with just the right sweetness is indulgent.

One of the hidden gems of Ann Siang.  Had a delightful meal where simple ingredients were turned into delightful dishes. One of the notable dishes is the grilled avocado.

Had the pleasure of meeting the chef, you know a place is special when you feel honored to be part of the excitement and sincerity behind his craft. Uni pudding is still splendid, and the burrata with candied walnuts and leek was completely delicious. The unexpected star were the delightfully light donuts with lemon curd; a great recommendation and a perfect ending.

Monday evening ended with good conversations and lightbulb moments over small plates of sea urchin pudding, Don Bocarte anchovies, Echire butter, smoked eel, gratinated leek fondant, buffalo mozzarella, and frog legs. Definitely a good end to the start of the a gruesome week if I have to say so myself. Oh, did i mention about desserts too? Like one of each item from the menu? Anyway, good night y\'all. Burp! | #eatingout #food #restaurantoftheday #lights
