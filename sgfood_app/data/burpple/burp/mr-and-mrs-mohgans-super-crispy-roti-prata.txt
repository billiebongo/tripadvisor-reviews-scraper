There\'s a nice fragrance to that plain dough! It\'s good! Top 5 places for Prata in Singapore!
[$0.90 for kosong and $1.40 for egg.] We came around 9.15am on a Saturday but the place was already crowded. Took a while for us to get our pratas but it was worth the wait. I don\'t really find the pratas super crispy actually, but I\'m not complaining cos I actually prefer them chewy. The texture/consistency was just right imo! Ohh and Mrs Moghan was so nice too:)
Dough that\'s stretched, flipped, turned and then fried to perfection on the flat iron top is just music to my ears and food for my tummy. Paired with the fish curry (I forgot to add the sambal chilli in, damn) and we are good to go.
After two unsuccessful attempts, I finally managed to get my hands on them today. This is officially one of my top choices with the super crispy kosong prata ($0.90) and fluffy egg prata ($1.40). Don\'t even get me started on the fish curry that was served together with the prata, I might just queue overnight the next time in case I missed it again. Eating here brings back all the childhood memories of having real good pratas without all the fanciful toppings and additions. Just give me a kosong and egg prata any day. Breakfast will never look the same again.
Super crispy prata..highly recommend to eat it with their fish curry and ikan bilis sambal 
Voted as #1 position for the best prata in Singapore by Ieatishootipost and also a highly recommended place by sooooo many food bloggers, finally made a trip down after a gruesome IPPT session 😂.\n<br />Side track: WHY?! WHY $200 only?! Wanted silver so badly!! 😑😑😑 Anyway, the prata here were super fresh and extremely soft inside! There are three types of curry over here: Dhal, Fish and Sambal Ikan Bilis. I opted for the Dhal one, which is the mild curry mostly made up of potatoes because  it doesn\'t taste so spicy 😁. Oh, and do come early because the prata here are usually SOLD OUT before 12! \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
highly recommended by @thesilverchef and finally took some time to explore the area
Second try today and scored these crispy pratas at 0945am within 5-10 mins!!! They tend to be sold out at 1130am so you need to be early! While it was good - crisp prata without being too doughy, I wouldn\'t really wait too long for it!! Their fish curry and sambal chilli was a very good combination too 👌
Mr Mohgan has been making prata for more than 30 years. He makes his own dough, cooked the curry and flips the prata all by himself. Talk about quality control, this prata man sure knows how to make his customers happy. 
Before alighting, the cab driver asked me where was it as he wanted to head there for breakfast after dropping us off. 😅
You\'ll find yourself with a super human ability that is being able to inhale these delicious pratas. Gone in a flash.
Tired of stale, limp, oily kosongs that totally don\'t hit the spot? That\'s cos so many places in Singapore now use prata dough that comes premade and from an evil cardboard box. If you want the real deal, this is the place. Small but superbly crispy plain pratas that you can\'t stop eating, dunked in glorious fish curry, or sambal if you prefer. This will satisfy any prata craving you have. Photo by Joyz X.
My favorite way of having prata, with dal and sambal! Crispy on the outside, still chewy in the inside. Best thing is, it\'s made fresh upon ordering!!! Best weekend breakfast😄
Discovered a new love- the cheese prata

Back at Mohgan\'s for their thick crispy prata.. I must say that their standard has maintained and despite long waiting time, it\'s well worth the wait. Super dense, crispy fragrant prata top with ikan billis sambal and chicken curry! Give me another plate already!😋\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#crispyprata#mrandmrsmohgan#prata#rotiprata#foodie#eatsg#delicious#prata#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#burger#localfood#breakfastsg#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending

Situated amongst terrace houses and condos, this coffeeshop seems quite out of place. Walk in and the hustling and bustling of the morning crowd hits you. Everyone is here just for one thing. Yup yup.. you guessed it. Roti prata.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Round and crisp pratas with the usual fish or mutton curry dips. The curries were alittle sweet. Ask for the sambal chilli (almost everyone had it); an ikan bilis plus onions kinda base which had little heat. I had 3 kosong (plain ones) with minimal dunking in the curry. Actually I preferred to enjoy it on its own as sweet curry is not to my liking. Yes.. were you expecting to see the end product? Oh well.. prata looks like prata. This is the raw form and it was not easy to snap as Mr Moghan was very swift in his actions.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />I am truly impressed at Mrs Moghan who writes down all orders. She remembers your order by what you wear. Amazing. Once your order is up, she will wave at you for pick up. Amidst all the noise and the chaos, she still gives you a friendly smile.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />A friend asked me if it was up to my expectations. To each his own, I suppose. My palate tells me this is not da best but it is the better ones around. So go try for yourself if you do not mind the wait.
Waiting time was 45mins as I watch the lady wrote our name down on a clip board.  After 30mins or so.. wala! Prata was served and I proceed to eat it as it is.! The texture and the fragrant was perfect. It\'s really crispy and not oily too! The dough is thick enough to give you the shiok feeling when you bite as compared to those crispy but paper thin type. We ask for sambal and it did not disappoint too. Spicy/sweet taste with I think Ikan Billis?? As always, my usual accomplice are the curry, and sugar, and dipping into them has always maximize my pleasure when eating Prata.. Overall, this is very good and I think it\'s probably the new generation of jalan kayu and casuarinas!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#crispyprata#mrandmrsmohgan#prata#rotiprata#foodie#eatsg#delicious#prata#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#burger#localfood#breakfastsg#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Enjoying a plate of crispy prata on a rainy morning!
20plus minutes wait for Crispy roti Prata by legendary couple. Slight taste of salt within - comes with good daal. Or you can request fish or mutton curry. Good! (神雕侠侣)
Right in the middle of Joo Chiat, right in the middle of a private residential estate, one will never expect to find an old kopitiam there.\n<br />🔹\n<br />Roti prata well pan fried thin and crispy. Not doughy. Accompanied by dhal curry.. not by choice cos the chicken and mutton curry which I much preferred, was already sold out. The waiting time was about half an hour depending on the crowd.\n<br />🔹\n<br />The pieces are small so it is hardly a tummy filler. This to me was just a fun eat or a super light breakfast.\n<br />Address : 7 Crane Road
