Today spread - siew mai/ custard buns/ char siew bao/prawn rice roll/ prawn fritters / steamed carrot cake 
点心 or dim sum is a style of Cantonese cuisine prepared at bite-sized portions and usually eaten in the morning. However, it has transcended into a meal that can be eaten anytime of the day. For today\'s lunch, the team went to 一点心 to have some heartwarming dim sum to mark the impending end of the work week (5 pax approx $53). Items that left an impression are the Liu Sar Pau and Xiao Long Bao.
Bite sized bun with flowy custard only complaint the skin is abit thick but the taste make up for that. 
Glutinous rice, har gao, phoenix claws, steamed carrot cake and custard bun.
Wonder how it might taste like?
In the midst of reviewing this humble dimsum stall, stay tuned! 😄
😋 Super affordable dimsum! This cost us ~$21+ and the running made up for the guilt from eating! Nomnom!
such great weather to snuggle in bed. if not, have a luo mai gai for brekkie and have a  good weekend ya\'ll \n<br />on another note, the gei kiang me went to take part in inter company basketball competition. after tt short training a couple days ago, I\'m feeling like a paralyzed man. can\'t move no body parts without feeling the ache. #growingold
found the banana overly hard, yet still a worthy dimsum dish.  it\'s finally Friday. an almost jammed packed week with tastings, meetup, basketball, blogging and work. quite an achievement
I know of a fren who love this dish so much, but imma ain\'t a fan of glutinous rice. still quite yummy when prepared right. \n<br />have a good weekend everyon!!. any good makan places to suggest?
today, I\'m having this gooy moist version. 🙋🙋🙋🙋 as good as my favorite at tunglok. \n<br />heng no queue today
Review of my hood\'s hidden dimsum gem up on blog 一点心. Cheap and decent. Www.ms-skinnyfat.com
The 流沙包 was slightly dry, and was not oozing out as picture depicted. BUT The Siew Mai and 虾饺 were fresh and tasty. And the black bun (weekend special) was a pleasant surprise. 
Was told that the liu sha bao here is amazeballs and it certainly met my expectations! Yummeh!
Just found out there\'s a dim sum place near my house with liu sha bao!!!
For good dim sum sold at coffeeshop prices, many come here for their super-flowy liu sha bao, but items such as the siew mai or har kow may not be up to restaurant standards. Also try their steamed beancurd roll and steamed carrot cake. Bear in mind it\'s located in an eating house, so don\'t expect comforts!
Love good food but lazy to queue... So went to Yi Dian Xin instead of joining the infamous queue of Tim Ho Wan. Custard filling is not exploding as some others said. Taste quite normal to me, skin was quite thick, but still a good place to cure your craving for Custard bun at a friendly price. 
petite liu sha bao that are so awesome! better than most dim sum restaurants! 
Serving a variety of dimsum at affordable prices, @eatmoresg team stuffed ourselves silly with, of course, tasty dimsum! Our favourites: steamed carrot cake, custard buns!

Good dim sum at affordable prices!
This is not a very nice picture because somebody refuses to tear it open and hold up for me.
Some things never change, do they?
Highly recommended 👍👍
Lovely Saturday guys!! 🍴😊 #dimsum #chinesefood #asianfood #happybelly #comfortfood #sgfood #nothongkongmichelinstarred
Affordable dimsum! Salted egg custard bun and 小笼包 are must-try! Steamed carrot cake - not bad as well!

Steamed carrot cake is a definite must try!
Very good variety of dim sum selection.

This place serves cheap n decent dim sum and I like this glutinious rice heaps! 😋😋😋\n<br />Warning - not for restuarants goers as this is located in a coffeeshop ;-)
steam carrot cake... cheap dimsum. #nomnomnom #mycafediary #sgcafe #cafe #burpple #onthetable #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #filter #vscocam #YOLO #foodspotting #sgfoodie #whati8today

Go for the 流沙包 and 腐皮卷. I find the other items okay. Maybe abit too much five spice powder in the siewmai and the chickfeet is the peppery version. Charsiewbao is the sweet version, less savoury. Good value but not to be compared with the hotel and restaurants clearly.
