Coconut ice cream that needed to be more, well, coconutty. Love the assortment of toppings, though – peanuts! Jackfruit! Attap chee! So generous that I didn\'t have a single spoonful of coconut ice cream plain.
tom yam soup, chicken wings and rice in a cute old-school tin lunch set! the decor and feel of this place is really interesting
Seafood + Kaffir lime + Sweet basil + Lemongrass
Super value set $9.90. For the petite thai lady apetite
Super nice, not too sweet and have the unique Thai tea fragrance.
Pre-Christmas get-together with colleagues. Casual Thai food in a colourful, eclectically decorated environment. Not exceptionally crowded, mostly customers from nearby offices.
Thai food sets served in Tingkats.  Good for a quick bite. @anteje
Am a sucker for places with nice decor and ambience. Nothing to rave about the food but this place warrants a second visit
If you are working in the CBD district, you should be familiar with Folks Collective. Opened for barely 3 months, this new Thai restaurant is already creating a hype in the F&amp;B scene. Here\'s a photo of Thai fish cakes, creamy tom yam seafood soup. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/folks-collective-thai-food-served-in-tingkat/
Authentic and value for money Thai food from this up and coming restaurant located at Cross Street. Lunch sets at $9.90. Opens till late too.
Beautiful hipster meets vintage Thai restaurant opens at China Sq. High on aesthetics, not so high on food. Review at DanielFoodDiary.com

However, sad to say, not many of the places get it right, really had high expectations for this but it somehow fell flat as the overall taste did not win over me. Spicy it was, but Lack of sourness and oomph.\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#folkscollective#tomyum#tomyumsoup#thaisoup#seafood#thaifood#foodie#eatsg#soup#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
Result is its extraordinary fragrance and sweetness too! It’s generally rich and very tasty! The only problem is that I should have gotten duck(recommended) or the other meat instead of chicken which feels like ‘leftovers’! But as far as the curry is concern, It’s really good!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#folkscollective#curry#chickencurry#lychee#lycheecurry#thaifood#foodie#eatsg#redcurry#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

We had a table full of delicious Thai food... Pomelo Salad 🥙, Morning Glory with Fried Pork 🥗, Fried Shrimp Pancake 🍤🥞, Seafood Pad Thai 🍝! Missing in action, Clear Seafood Tom Yam Soup 🍲!! Oh, they also have cheap set lunches on weekday from 11-3pm! 3 different sets to choose from, 1 rice and 2 ingredients for $10.90! Great alternative for those who want a change from Hawker food! @folkscollective #folkscollective #folkscollectivesg #thaifood #padthai #thaifoodstagram

Used to be a street food sold in casual local eateries, but now a famous Thai dish.
Taste similar to the one I had at one of the streets of BKK.
Hipster Thai restaurant with affordable lunch sets.
Set Menu $9.90++
I had to loosen a few buttons just to stomach all that broccoli and cauliflower (who would know tt stir fried veggies meant just these 2 varieties 😫d\'oh) . Overall, still a great meal made better by the #theentertainerapp! #whati8today #foodcoma #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #sgfoodtrend #burpple #hungrygowhere #folkcollective #sgthaifood #SSfoodtrail
Miss this!!! 😋
