Highly sought after by diners, I can see why after having it. Soft, mushy mix of spinach with their home made creamy sauce makes it so enjoyable its a great opportunity to feed those who dislikes having their greens. 
Totalled to $100.10 for dinner for this set. Was pork knuckles, baby back ribs and sausages with a side of coleslaw and salad. More than enough to fill the tummies of 3-4 people. Baby back ribs was super tender and the skin of the pork was on point (absolutely crispy). Rest of the dishes ranged around $20-30++. They\'ve also a set lunch here which comes with a soup, drink and main course. 
It was very chocolatey but too moist for me. Good with the ice cream.
However, after my review during Restaurant Week, the restaurant contacted me, not through my Instagram, but the personal email I left on the review page. I was invited back for a meal with a friend because they pride themselves on good food and service. \n<br />So here I am, back at The Chop House for lunch. I must say I\'m impressed by the tenderloin today. Very tender and juicy, and the caramelised onions were fantastic.  Maybe it was just #restaurantweeksg.
Cooked with bits of finely grained corn pulps made it extra rich and added a lovely texture to it. This is the real deal.  
Wasted #restaurantweeksg2015 meal 😩
The only thing good was the cream of forest mushroom soup. The pasta was so limp and overcooked. And this creme brûlée was totally lumpy. Now I can say that I\'ve had a horrible creme brûlée. And to add to that, it was so difficult to get the attention of wait staff here. I\'m putting this as politely as I can. Will never come back here EVER.
Indeed, the Australian Grass Fed Beef Tenderloin is splendid! However, I gotta say their signature Pork burger was a disappointment, kinda tough and pricey. Their ambience and service would definitely make up for it though.
back here for the tenderloin again because it\'s just soo good😋
it\'s soo good, surely will come back for this again
Suffering a hangover from the previous night\'s excesses and feeling the mid-day work blues?  Chophouse\'s take on the Bloody Mary is breakfast, lunch and hangover cure all rolled into one tasty drink. Absolut vodka, smoked bacon, rosemary, homemade roma tomato mix, lemon juice, tabasco. You\'ll be knocking out those spreadsheets in no time after knocking back this restorative yet punchy cocktail.
I\'m having the US Prime Rib Eye and it is just sooooo goooood! The steak is well marbled, cooked to perfection, juicy and just melts in your mouth! The onion jam, creamed spinach and black peppercorn sauce most certainly complimented the steak to its best! This is one of my top choices for steak now! #foodie #fatdieme
Very hip and modern restaurant deco but food wise honestly nothing memorable. We had the signature burger and fish &amp; chips. Both were average at best.
Deep fried soft shell crab is great, deep fried soft shell crab burger is even better.
Burger was good but the portion was quite huge. Nice place with good ambience but a little noisy and service crew couldn\'t notice us most of the time.
Black &amp; Blue. Blackened with Cajun spices, the beef patty was so juicy cooked to medium doneness. Couldn\'t taste the Cajun, but the creamy dressing of blue cheese was just strong enough so I got a taste of its distinct flavour, yet subtle enough not to overpower the beef. Plus points for the tater tots deep-fried with a perfect crunchy crust.
Aaamazing, not only one of the best #PorkChops I\'ve had but one of the best pork dishes I\'ve had. The meat was so tender and juicy and oh so tasty, the sauce they used on it was phenomenal, especially when coupled with the #OnionJam 😘👌 #arkay2014 #arkayinsg #foodPorn
Bacon, Guacamole and Chicken Burger ($20) - good ambience and delicious burgers
Mixed Seafood Grill at The Chop House. Grilled salmon, calamari and juicy big prawns! Nom! #food
A very very very satisfying meal to end of Monday! My fav was the pork chops and the sweet potato fries! Simply delish! 😍😍😍
colleagues were raving about this at dept dinner. I thought it was above average but not awesome. Patty was chunky enough and beef done med rare, but no caramelized onions, I think all awesome burgers need that! p/s the quesadillas ($15++) here are pretty awesome. 
Dark Chocolate Ganache Tart. Hansel and Gretel ate up all the chocolate and the evil witch was banished to hell where there is gnashing of teeth. She died an old tart. Chocolates saves the world again.
The Chop House Baileys Cheesecake. Not the birthday cake for the birthday uncle. His cake is at home. Celebration continues at home. Haha.
Sweet Potato Fries.... We liked it and ordered another portion. Haha....
Very thick and juicy burger. Very good.

Chomp chomp chomp this juicy thick minced Pork Burger with applewood smoked bacon and pickles. Fortunately we had people to share. Or I have to go to the gym again. #instavideo
Any fans of sweet potato fries here? #instavideo featuring special guest star @misstamchiak . See me feed her! Lol
A good sharing for 2; $48. We liked the lamb cut most, clean tasting without the strong gamy flavor in the lamb sausage. The beef tenderloin was semi-tender and slightly dry. Recommended doneness for both lamb and beef cuts: medium. The lamb is amazingly baby tender, soft, and sooo juicy!! I will return for more. The pork sausage has been decent but forgettable. 
Sweet lingering taste in each mouthful, slightly crisp batter coated the delicate texture wonderfully. $6 for a vegetable side :))
Well seasoned beef chunks gathered tightly within the melting cheese pocketed in between a lightly charred flat bread, delightfully tasty. A worthy starter. 
A strip of well-seared grassfed sirloin that doesn\'t break the bank. Cheap indulgence. 
First bite verdict: char siew!  It really tastes like char siew but more flavourful than that. This eatery is an offspring of Wooloomooloo, one of my favourite steakhouses. It didn\'t disappoint with the quality of the meat plus its cheaper too. Value for $$$. 
Patty melt burger medium well-done. Half pound beef patty smothered with sautéed onions and Irish cheddar cheese.
Pork and honey sausages on creamy mashed potatoes, onion and red wine sauce served in cast iron plate.
Sweet potato fries again!
Friday dinner at The Chop House! 🍴
Lookit at that gooey cheese floweth over! \n<br />I asked for medium and it came pretty well done (no pink at all 😭). Still juicy and hit the spot tho. •\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#happyfood #happybelly #explodingbelly #happythoughts #iloveburgers #burgers #hamburgers #singaporefoodie #burgerssg #chophouse #chophousesg #fatdieme #burpple
The texture of this cheesecake is amazing; creamy and rich, as smooth as silk. It has the right amount of sweetness. A touch of my favorite liquor in a cake really makes a difference! 🍾🧀🍰\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @thechophouse.sg for your hospitality!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #foodcoma #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodie #yummy #sgrestaurant #exploresingapore #sgfoodblogger #foodstyling #foodstylist #foodplating #chef #foodblogger #f52grams #burpple #likesforlikes #dessert #sweettooth #dessertporn #cheesecake #cake #baileys
You can check out The Chop House that has two branches; one in Vivo City and one at 112 Katong. It\'s quite nice and you don\'t have to burn a hole in your pocket. Besides steaks, they also have other mains such as burgers, fajitas, pork chop, and seafood. There are plenty of choices for everyone. 🥘🥙🍔🍤\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @thechophouse.sg for your hospitality!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #foodcoma #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodie #yummy #sgrestaurant #exploresingapore #sgfoodblogger #foodstyling #foodstylist #foodplating #chef #foodblogger #f52grams #burpple #beef #burpplesg #steak #ribeye #delicious

😻👏🏻Chanced upon a gem of perfectly done Medium Rare Sirloin Steak 🐮 with Béarnaise sauce, accompanied by Juicy Grilled Tomatoes🍅. Didn\'t really like the raw Watercress though, would much rather have Arugula as an accompaniment, but hey, for $22 this was an awesome steak!!! 😋💗💗💗 #yummy #delicious #food #foodporn #foodforlife #foodforyummies #sgfoodies #sgfood #steak #foodlover #foodpics #sgcafe #cafehoppingsg #burpple #burpplesg #mediumrare

Creamy vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso topped with a tart raspberry... This is life...

The tender and tasty pork definitely makes it one of the best pork chops in Singapore. #eatwithzac

Feeling the onset of the midday munchies amid the fogginess of my sleep-deprived brain; I\'ve been having very poor sleep the past couple of nights.
Meat your destiny!
We waited quite long for our orders and the portion was too small to satisfy my hunger. The steak and sauces didn\'t disappoint though, but the ribs weren\'t as good as the steak! #thechophouse #chophousesg #foodporn #foodgasm #sgfood #steak #lastnight #dinner #sgeats #burpple

Set steak for lunch, the beef was quite tough for a medium-done steak. Expected better though since it was a steakhouse 
Overall not bad. The good part is they are opened till 11pm (last order 1030pm), just nice for a late dinner after movie =) #dinner #foodplease #eatout #foodporn #yummy #fatdieme #makanhunt #food #instagood #instafood #instafoodies #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodinc #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #happytummy #foodphotography #foodpics #openricesg #FoodReviewsAsia

This afternoon late lunch - Black &amp; Blue (Blue Cheese Burger) A little disappointing though due to the too little blue cheese stanch in it. Good service, and pretty place.

Loved the horse radish! #foodporn #chophouse
