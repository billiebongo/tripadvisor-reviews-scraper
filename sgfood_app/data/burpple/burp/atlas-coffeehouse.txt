Finally got to try this coffeehouse in the west! Surprisingly it wasn’t so crowded by the time we arrived, and my order came pretty quickly. Some items may take a while longer though. Portion wise, very generous, definitely enough to last you till dinner. Service was great, people there were friendly:) another recommended item would be the Atlas Butterscotch Banana pancake (15 mins wait). But good things are worth waiting right?:)
Fluffy pancake that is great for sharing. Price is a little on the steep side.
A typical dimlighing natural lighting coffee shop. Service was good
Cost: $12.50\n<br />Taste: 4/5 😋😋😋\n<br />Try it!!! The scoop\n<br />Of salted Carmel ice cream is the best combine to spread with the waffle✌🏻
Coffee here\'s pretty good! It\'s surprisingly popular even on a weekday morning, and got crowded around lunch.
Always a good bet when you come to Atlas to get a good meal but it comes with a price. This plate costs about $20 with the add-ons, but it’s more than enough to sustain you through till dinner if you have it for brunch. The mushrooms were nice, and I didn’t mind how the sourdough soaked up all of the juices to be slightly softer, but that could be an annoyance to others.
still my favourite waffles after 5 years. served fresh off the waffle iron, topped with rich, gooey salted caramel and vanilla ice cream, it is hard to bear this. the waffle that yields its crisp crust at the slightest slice to reveal fluffy waffley goodness inside, the salty caramel you could lick off a spoon and the cold, clean, creamy vanilla ice cream. it is a dream to eat and a nightmare for diets.
Salted caramel buttermilk waffles—$12.50\n<br />Truffle shoestring fries—$8
At last. Atlas coffehouse. I always pass by this place but never had the chance to patronise as it\'s always packed. However today at 10.30am it was pretty empty so I decided to swing by. The waffle was ok only as the caramel sauce was a tad too sweet for my liking. I couldn\'t trace any hint of Earl Grey in the ice cream. The Hazelnut latte was very satisfying (asked for less syrup). The wait staff and cashier were all very service oriented and friendly. Total bill was $19.80 including GST. No service charge.
The salted caramel waffle ($12.50) was savoury and sweet at the same time! Quite a special taste to try out. The sauce was just nice and the ice cream was just nice as well. The earl grey waffle ($12.50) however, was a bit disappointing. The strawberry taste did not quite match with the refreshing earl grey ice cream. In addition, the waffle taste itself could not quite match up to WIMBLY lu\'s waffles as the texture was a bit lacking. But it was still a great brunch all in all! Atmosphere was great💯
The pancake is fluffy, moist and crispy all around the edges. Topped with caramelized bananas, crispy honey coated cereal and a vanilla honeycomb ice cream, and some homemade butterscotch sauce - the contrast in temperature and textures made this such a delight to eat! #burpple #atlascoffeehouse
A good ambience, a good cup of coffee and free wifi usage! An ideal venue for work and catch-up sessions 😬
ATLAS Butterscotch Banana Pancakes ($18.50) is something not to be miss! A massive yet fluffy pancake served with caramelized banana, honey coated cereal and honey comb ice cream, before dunking it in house-made butterscotch. The perfect addition to your morning coffee though might want to go light on those butterscotch sauce. Do note there\'s a long wait time of 20 minutes!\n<br />•\n<br />Atlas Coffeehouse\n<br />Address: 6 Duke\'s Rd, Singapore 268886\n<br />#atlascoffeehouse
Every cafe or restaurants would almost have this on their menu or a similar response to a truffle or parmasean fries. But what made Atlas truffled fries special is how amazingly fresh its done, and no wonder it\'s a must order on almost every table. It\'s almost like a chain reaction as the truffle scent permeates across from table to table as each round of fries was served. The look on the face of the customers at their neighboring table as this was served was as consistent as the fresh shoestring truffled fries were presented generously and snowed under heavy shavings of Parmesan. Certainly my favourite fries with that not overly crispy texture, thin and retains that moist flaccid core.
All the right combo of essential elements of the food pyramid, the carbs = sour dough setting the base, proteins = eggs, bacon and pulled pork and veg = arugula. The stewed pulled pork is all juicy, savoury and tender which binds all the elements together. You would by now realized my food pyramid is kind of skewed, but when it\'s so darn good, everything goes.
It almost sounds or looks like atas chye-png bowl and well such grain bowls are probably a staple these days in cafe to have their rendition of our hawker stall\'s economic mixed vegetable and rice on a plate! I was drawn to ordering this because of the grilled miso egg plant. And boy I wasn\'t disappointed, except that it should come in a slightly bigger cut. The white miso is torched and complements the eggplant\'s otherwise tasteless flesh. Comparing to the other items on the menu this is probably for the small eater. Well, don\'t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with bowl, mushroom and tomatoes were well sautéed, kale was kind of air-fried to a nice marinated crips. Stir-fried chicken chunks were satisfactory and savoury. Corn was a must giving both the balance of flavour and substance, as the grain base used was quinoa, which was nothing short of tasty but was only a really thin layer at the base. At the end of it all, it might well be the case of too good (hence) too little.
Their signature dish: Creamy mushroom on sourdough (+scrambled eggs $3)! The portion was hugeeee, good for two pax. Also ordered the truffle fries to share, but the portion was so generous that we had to dabao the leftover. Just look at the tremendous amount of cheese shredded on top. the only thing bad about this cafe is it is too noisy, we could barely hear each other.
Found the white wine creamy mushrooms with the Parmesan to be abit too overpowering for me but I can see why people like it. The scrambled eggs were quite good in my opinion.
Salmon with soba ($18+)\n<br />With my report from health screening telling me my total cholesterol is 259, salmon, mushrooms, soba I\'ll eat you! \n<br />Yummy and good for me, sans the egg yolk 😊😊😊 \n<br />Coffee, lime tart and tea were great too!\n<br />Full house on a weekday lunchtime, at a not-so-accessible place... and now I know why!
Back to the basics - 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟And Atlas NAILED it!! Soft and melty on the inside and crispy on the outside 😍 I like how they\'re not afraid to put both sweet and savoury on one plate.
Chose to add scrambled eggs to our toast. Would recommend this combination because the creaminess of the scrambled eggs really complements the crunchiness of the mushrooms and goes so well with the sourdough toast! I also loved how chewy the toast was. 10/10 would eat again.
BEST PANCAKE EVER! in short, it tasted like POPCORN FLAVORED PANCAKE.🍿
Have a sweet treat over at Atlas with their ever-popular Butterscotch Banana Pancake ($18.50); pricier than most pancakes outside but fared better than the competition. The honey comb ice cream was the X-factor in this dish but I do not fancy the honey corn flakes as it makes the entire dish just overly-sweet.\n<br />•\n<br />Atlas Coffeehouse\n<br />Address: 6, Duke’s Road, Singapore 268886\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes
The ultimate flavour after being slowly braised for 18 hours on top of a sourdough, combined with the creamy yet fluffy texture of the scrambled egg, and finished with a nice touch of bacon. SLOW YET MAXIMUM SATISFACTION! (SGD 20.00)
I can taste body of the cold brew coming with a refreshing sensation. Perfectly matched with the Pulled Pork I\'m having. (SGD 7.00)
Always passed by and seeing long queue, finally know why it\'s getting such attention when i came early ard 9am. Had the super bowl, salmon soba, butterscotch banana pancake... oh boy! They all taste sooo GOOD! Salmon is semi-cooked at the right texture. Super bowl has all ingredients blended so well to give u Umph! trust me u want to have it again. The thick pancake is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside, good for 3-4 person sharing else it can be too sweet for one person to consume it. Coffee is normal but i give thumb up for their food and service.
Returned to Atlas after a long time despite having wanted to go there again / living really near and I\'m so glad I did. Ordered the Super Bowl once again with kale, corn, toasted quinoa, chicken, eggplant, mushrooms and tomatoes for $19.30 (sadly there is GST now). However, the dish was so much tastier than I remember. Every component was seasoned nicely and came together to deliver a wholesome bite. If I traded the GST for this added deliciousness, I will definitely do it anytime.
We chose the sausage add on over bacon/ eggs although eggs would probably have been a better pairing. There was generous servings of grated Parmesan cheese and it was an overall simple but tasty dish - makes for a filling hearty breakfast to start your day right ⭐️ 3.5/5 ⭐️\n<br />📍@atlascoffeehouse, 6 Duke\'s Road S268886 (near Botanics MRT)

Soft, fluffy &amp; moist on the inside and crispy on the outside - the perfect pancake. We opted out of ice cream for more bananas 🍌. The caramelized cornflakes provided an added crunch that went very well with the yummy pancakes and it was an overall good dessert without being overly sweet (if you control on adding the maple syrup) ⭐️ 4/5 ⭐️\n<br />📍@atlascoffeehouse, 6 Duke\'s Road S268886 (near Botanics MRT)

Atlas is a great pitstop for coffee if you\'re on the go (they use a blend of Guatemalan and Brazilian beans from Two Degrees North Coffee Co.) or for long brunches with friends — just be sure to swing by early to snag a seat on weekends. For a downright comforting meal, go for the Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough ($12) — a generous heap of mushrooms cooked with a splash of white wine and sundried tomatoes, which you must pair with the silky smooth Scrambled Eggs ($3 to add on, totally worth it). The ATLAS Super-Bowl ($17) loaded with toasted quinoa, beautifully oven-roasted squash and zucchini as well as shimeiji mushrooms is satisfying, yet light enough to not warrant a food coma after. If you still have space, you might be tempted by the irresistible pancakes, but we recommend the Mixed Berries Compote Waffles ($12.50) instead. They are similar in taste but the latter is lighter and more affordable. \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person \n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Acamas Teo

Simple Pleasures.😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: I strongly suggest either going during the weekdays, before 12 on weekends or just make a reservation through Burpple or Chope to avoid waiting in lines for eons. 🖖🏻
My first dining experience at Atlas Coffeehouse. The Earl Grey Caramel Waffles left me pretty impressed. It was one of the most fragrant waffles I\'ve eaten, and crispy on the outside while chewy on the inside - just like what a good waffle (in my definition) should be. The earl grey and caramel flavours worked well and did not overpower each other. Spied on the mains from other tables and they looked pretty good too.
So generous with that cheese and truffle oil. Definitely coming back for more
Soy cappuccino. Very good and smooth. Not many cafes make a good soy based coffee, as soy protein tends to coagulate in coffee, or the soy milk used isn\'t very good with their roast. Fortunately this was real good.
The mushrooms were sauteed in a garlicky creamy white wine sauce and topped with grated parmesan cheese. I love love love this sourdough. It was thick and toasted to perfection, excellent for soaking up every bit of the delicious cream sauce. They were also so generous with the amount of mushroom. This dish may not look like much, but if you do finish both slices of bread (each of which was the size of my face), this will be more than substantial.
☕️\n<br />•\n<br />With an extensive Coffee Menu that\'s spoils &amp; also fulfilled every caffeine addict, comes the Black Bird. That is if you are into Cold Brews (which I am totally into with the weather in SG) 🏵\n<br />The Black Bird comes with a tasting of 3 cold brews, it got my curiosity but the Nitro Brew caught my attention &amp; heart. It\'s like drinking a carbonated black coffee, it\'s either you Love it or Hate it kinda thing. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Other stand out coffees are: \n<br />The Milky Way - Cold brew Coffee (💵S$7)\n<br />Barista Breakfast - Latte &amp; Double espresso (💵S$8) \n<br />Magic - 5oz Double Shot (💵S$5) \n<br />Hazelnut Latte (💵S$6 +S$1 for iced)\n<br />Toffee Latte (💵S$6 +S$1 for iced)
To top it off, there was a well cooked egg with lots of seasoning on top to make it extra yummy. Really enjoyed the combination of all the components ⭐️ 4/5 ⭐️\n<br />📍@atlascoffeehouse, 6 Duke\'s Road S268886 (near Botanics MRT)

🍲\n<br />•\n<br />The thought of having this in a minimalistic cafe looking out the window with drops of rain splattering on a gloomy rainy day, plus a cup of good cuppa &amp; maybe just maybe any Lang Lev book will be perfect. ☕️\n<br />But who am I kidding, it\'s Warm, it\'s Flavourful, it\'s Heartwarming &amp; it\'s Satisfying. I\'m talking about the Summer Chicken Stew not the Damn Weather. 😋 •\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: It get pretty crowded on the weekends afternoon, so much so that one\'s gotta wait (God knows how Long) in line to dine. Therefore I\'d strongly suggest for you to make a reservation with @chopesg on their App/Web or through @burpple 🖖🏻
🍞\n<br />•\n<br />Brunch is one of the very few reasons I even bother to wake up in the weekends especially after a night of partying &amp; drinking. 🍻\n<br />An almost Umami Creamy Mushrooms, Hearty Scrambled Eggs, cream soaked centre with crunchy side toasted Sourdough... almost a perfect Brunch. Plus the portion runs Big. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: A Sister cafe of Assembly Coffee, Atlas CoffeeHouse serves Third-Wave Coffee &amp; Hearty Nosh in the lushest, chilliest spots that\'s just a stone throw away from Botanic Gardens &amp; the quiet estates of Bukit Timah. 🖖🏻
Brunch just wouldn\'t be complete without waffles. And Atlas\' berry compote waffles are some of the best in the land, so you really, really don\'t have much of an excuse not to order \'em.
I haven\'t had a lazy Saturday brunch in quite a while, and I could definitely do worse than to get back into the swing of it with Atlas Coffeehouse.
As tart as it sounds. Extremely fluffy pancake with a cranberry &amp; strawberry topping and maple syrup. The perfect balance of sweet and sour.  Price per person: $25
This creamy mushroom on sourdough with scrambled eggs was on-point. The cream sauce was just right. The sourdough was a nice touch, something different to balance the palate. Will definitely come back for it! $25 per pax. 
Dark Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50)
Summer Chicken Stew ($18)
Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough ($14)
Cause Mondays could always use a bit of wonder. Finally back for the first time since Xing Wei\'s Tasty Tastemaker Tour! This cold brew definitely put a smile on my face. As a creamy, sweet cuppa, it reminded me of Old Hen but slightly less sweet.

this fluffy pancake right here reminds me of ricotta pancakes but a way better version. Fluffy on the inside and full of caramelised banana butterscotch sauce soaking into the fluffy pancakes. So good we wiped it clean off our plates.
You know you\'re off to a good start to the day when you receive a plate like this. Two good slices of sourdough covered in mushrooms ($14), and if you\'re a big eater like me, I\'ll suggest adding on the Scrambled Eggs (+$3) and Bacon (+$3) too. All-in-all it\'s slightly pricey but it\'s worth it in my opinion, not many places do a decent western breakfast and Atlas does it well. The cafe is pleasant, comfortable, and also located near the Botanic Gardens if you decide to burn off the extra add-ons and make yourself feel better.
Luscious scrambled eggs &amp; creamy mushroom on toasted Sour Dough :) Loved it!! Good for sharing, this came in a generous portion which I almost couldn\'t finish. 
This butterscotch pancake is a bomb! I like how it\'s crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I like the buttery aroma that exudes from the pancake when I cut through it. It totally won me over when the ice cream gave the added oomph to take you to heaven when you eat it together with the pancake and maple syrup. The honey gold flakes that comes with the dish really adds aesthetic excitement to the dish. Winner! I\'ll be back!
It\'s my first time trying anything similar to this creamy mushroom with sourdough bread. Personally it\'s not my kind of food. I felt the dish itself taste wise is a very safe choice for breakfast and definitely executed well. Perhaps the mushroom and cream sauce could be slightly sweeter. The fried egg we added made the entire meal more nutritious. You can\'t go wrong with this if you can\'t decide what to order
The waffles were light and fluffy. Drizzled with a generous amount of Salted Caramel sauce (which was damn yummmz) and topped with a scoop of Vanilla Ice-cream. I think I found my favourite place for waffles already ☺️👍🏻💖
This lofty cafe decked out in pretty marbled tiles and deep sea blue walls along Bukit Timah Road is great for long brunches with friends, which is why the snaking queue doesn\'t come at a surprise. Beat the crowd (and earn Chope dollars!) by reserving a table on our app beforehand so you can sail by on weekends and be immediately seated. While many go straight for the irresistible pancakes and waffles (which they do very well), it is the underrated ATLAS Super-Bowl ($17) loaded with toasted quinoa, beautifully oven-roasted squash and zucchini as well as shimeiji mushrooms that has us coming back for more. Topped with sundried tomatoes and the tastiest peanut sesame pulled chicken, it\'s the perfect balance between healthy and flavourful. End your meal with a Flat White ($4.50), made with a blend of Guatamalan and Brazilian beans from Two Degrees North Coffee Co.\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Kelly Wong
Oh I ate this after my second last 📝. This consists of spaghetti with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, basil and shimeji mushrooms and is also so so yummy.

Quite another wave of places that have started Cold Brew and Atlas Coffeehouse is one of them. Visited on the day where they first launched it — a pretty solid bottle of cold brew here if you are into Cold Brew as a beverage. The one here comes sweetened; a little reminiscent to those from Old Hen but a degree sweeter yet carrying a cocoa-like body in the middle and is smooth and creamy. Would probably appeal to those who generally don\'t take coffee due to its general flavour profile.
2 espresso shot is everything. Kept me awake till late night. Just what I needed! Now that exams are over~ I should cut down on coffee. 😆
Not a pancake person myself but ordered it even though tummy had been filled w their Salmon Soba Noodles (awesome btw) cause the bf was craving for it.
A good dessert to pair up with a cup of coffee for an afternoon treat.
I love so much inside of the cream is very fragrant, very smooth skin crisp
-\n<br />The white wine cream reduction is every! The moist sourdough soaked in the sauce is the highlight of my brunch.\n<br />-\n<br />Monster can\'t get enough of that sauce.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #atlascoffeehouse

Banana Pancake featuring signature fluffy pancake served with caramelized banana and house-made butterscotch &amp; honey comb ice cream.
Last weekend we dropped by ATLAS which was super packed, thankfully we use @chopesg to make reservation else wonder how long we might have to wait.
A great pastry to pair w my coffee! 🍃 Nicely crumbled crusted on the outside w sweet powdered sugar &amp; fully pumped w cream on the inside! Great if your mouth is abit itchy &amp; just looking for something light to satisfy your sweet cravings 🍼✨
A nice refreshing cup of nitro coffee to fight the heat on a hot Saturday afternoon! ☀️
Their Candied Butter waffles ($14) proved to be an enchanted fusion of sweet and savory and oh so sinful breakkie. Tone down the sweetness with their Cortado ($8) and indulge yourself in the serene café vibes.
Today was a very hot day...it was scorching hot and what a good way to tone it down was ice cream, meaning matcha ice cream with waffles 😂 They serve big servings (1 big plate) and it was worth the money ($12.50). Though i would say the waffles were crispy and the caramel sauce was superb
Ending my last Friday lecture break for this semester back at Atlas Coffeehouse after realizing that their humongous Choux Puffs come in different flavours. Today\'s variety (this as well as a Malted Milk variant) are both pretty new; the crumbly, crusty exterior works great with the tart passionfruit filling inside. Pretty refreshing as a dessert.
One of the best waffles I\'ve had! Extremely crispy exterior, with a moist and eggy inside and topped with a drizzle of salted caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream! I am missing it already 😍
There a few things I can\'t resist when I see them; Peranakan Kueh-Kueh, Chicken Corden Bleu and Cream Puffs are just some of the many things that I get haunted with whenever I pass by one. This mammoth of a cream puff (only slightly smaller than its serving plate) is one of the newest bakes at Atlas Coffeehouse; probably twice the size of the ones from NEATO although the price is almost proportionate to the size at $4.50. The Choux pastry itself is just a weenzy bit dry, but it isn\'t too bothersome especially with the crusty top dusted in icing sugar. Inside, the cream puff comes surprisingly filled with a good amount of Vanilla pastry cream that contains speckles of vanilla beans; a light hint of Vanilla fragrance runs through the thick cream that is simply delightful which fills up every gap within the puff. Simple, but definitely something that gets into me.
waffle with matcha ice cream (not matcha waffles)\n<br />•\n<br />some kopi, a cuppa of latte and a mocha\n<br />•\n<br />how issit not Friday yet? I\'m perplexed\n<br />•\n<br />back to one of my fav cafes to people look and chill
Started my day off with brunch at @atlascoffeehouse ! Of course I couldn\'t come here without trying their Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough + Scrambled Eggs ($14 + $3). The mushrooms soaked in a tomato cream sauce and topped with finely shredded cheese paired perfectly with the soft and creamy scrambled eggs.\n<br />•\n<br />The Earl Grey Waffles ($12.50) had a very strong Earl Grey flavour, which I absolutely loved 😍, and the waffles were fluffy on the inside, not that crispy on the outside, but still good nonetheless!
Whilst the jumbo prawn was the centerpiece what stood out was the umami from the sauce slicked pasta.
Enjoyed the Salmon Soba noodles! We also ordered Atlas Hash which we felt the portion was a bit small. Prices was a bit steep too. But the highlight was the coffee which was good.
Sister cafe of Assembly at Evans!! If you\'ve been to Assembly you\'d know what to expect from Atlas- with their similar setting and food. However, I very much prefer this place because of its much larger area and space. We tried the truffle fries which was great, but the buttermilk waffles, Oh buttermilk waffles, topped with a huge scoop of earl grey ice cream and thick caramel sauce was - indeed - brilliant!! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, just as we all love it to be😌 As good as Assembly\'s, or even better!! It has immediately made it\'s way to my top favourite waffle go-to. For waffle lovers, a place you must must check out.  Also not forgetting good coffee of course!! 
Healthy tasty brunch at Atlas Coffee House. I love they serve creative items like this (a bowl of quinoa with pulled chicken, tomato chutney, sautéed zucchini and pumpkin, and spinach leaves, $18) and salmon soba. Their espresso drinks were also great! I\'ll come back this place again.
We ordered this despite polishing off 2 pastas and the wings. Even then, it was SO GOOD. I took a first bite and literally put down my fork and SWOONED😍😍 I wish i had more of the salted caramel cos I was moping up every bit of drizzle on the plate. 
Love the fusion in this plate of goodness. Bits of garlic, prawns, chilli and cereal. Everything was tossed together so beautifully. Party in the mouth😍👍🏼
Mopped up all that creamy salted caramel sauce. So hard to find a good one but @atlascoffeehouse hits all the right notes with this version of their buttermilk waffles. 😍
Pancake lovers should try the freshly-made ATLAS Butterscotch Banana Pancake - Signature Fluffy Pancake served with Caramelized Banana &amp; House-Made Butterscotch &amp; Honey Comb Ice Cream.
Signature fluffy pancake served with caramelized bananas and house made butterscotch and honeycomb ice cream • $18.50 
I remembered having this on the day that Atlas Coffeehouse first opened and it was something that I really enjoyed. Fast forward 7 months and its still as good as it was; the crumble base still delicate but doesn\'t fall messily all over the plate with a tart and zingy lime curd that includes bits of lime pulp that enhances and gives a little more dimension in flavour. Definitely something I craved for knowing that Atlas Coffeehouse is opened for the Monday leading to National Day.
One of the few items in the newly-introduced pasta menu at Atlas Coffeehouse available only after 11am. A tze-char classic, this is a fusion dish where Cereal Prawn meets pasta that is close to the form of Aglio Olio. The cereal tiger prawn was plump and fresh — being a cafe dish, the prawn  and the cereal crumbs felt like separate entities unlike how it should be in a tzechar dish, but still buttery, fragrant and surprisingly not too greasy. The pasta comes tossed with oil, chili padi and garlic; savoury, garlicky and mildly spicy with every slurp. If there isn\'t enough prawn in the dish, then there are also a few pieces of shrimp on the side which helps to enhance the entire feel of the dish.
Wishing I had a cold brew coffee right meow with these two awesome people! 😜 \n<br />It\'s Wednesday! 2 more days till the end of the week! Jia you Melissa you can tahan this! 😂 182618711 bugs to debug and O(log n) things to do! Before I head off to Thailand, Malaysia, Bintan and US :)
The bananas and sea salt were really the game changer for the immensely dense dessert. Bananas gave the chocolate filling a different texture and contrasting flavor and the sea salt did its job to cut through the sweetness. Good pairing but I would advise this for sharing! 
The grain bowl is quite a plain offering.. I\'ve had better &amp; I\'d rather pick something better off their menu here!
Somehow this really pales in comparison compared to the better grains bowls I\'ve had at grain traders, ninja bowl &amp; populus! Maybe because it was just too wet and the dressing did not lift the dish but made it kinda heavy and jerlat. Plus the sides are not very impressive too.... 
Surprised to find that the soba was nicely tossed in a teriyaki sauce. Salmon was also nicely poached, very moist and soft. Decent dish but quite predictable  
Added scrambled eggs for $3, it was so buttery yet fluffy at the same time! Mushrooms were flavorful in that thick creamy sauce, soaking through the sourdough which made it really moist and yummy! 😋 the last time I rmb having such good scrambled eggs was from ronin! 
There are just too many elements in this dish. Poached Salmon (dipped in the Yogurt)melts in your mouth and it\'s incredibly addictive. Sunny side egg and the soba noodle is done well too. The Japanese mushroom added a brand new texture to the dish (when eaten with the soba noodles), chewy and flavourful. This dish is a work of art. 
Butterscotch banana pancake ($18.50)\n<br />This is the first time I\'m eating this type of pancake so can\'t really compare. I feel it is nice, still have some crisps on the outside while maintaining moist on the inside. Icecream slightly too sweet &amp; cornflake granular too hard. Almost thought my teeth fell off. 😅😅\n<br />7
And what\'s brunch without coffee, waffles and scrambled eggs? \n<br />Great company along with a really crowded hipster cafe even on a weekday afternoon was enough to warrant a hearty experience. \n<br />The Earl grey waffle was exceptionally fragrant. The texture of the waffle was pillowy and would bounce right back at it with light pressure with a fork. \n<br />The mushrooms on sourdough along with sausages and scrambled was distinguished to be no ordinary breakfast affair. The smooth and glistening egg melted in my mouth! 😱
The waffle was crispy on the exterior while soft and fluffy on the inside with a tinge of buttermilk aroma. We were pleasantly surprised that the ice cream took a while to melt and the strong vanilla ice cream was complemented well by the salted caramel drizzled over it
PRICE: Cold brew $6, Beef brisket and onions on sourdough $20 \n<br />No gst and service charge. 
If you\'re craving for a sugar rush yet flavorful, this could just be the thing for you! It\'s crunchy, the pancake was quite thick which looked like a cake. The butterscotch ice cream was on point though. 
Egg: finger Licking 👍\n<br />Mushroom and sundried tomato: finger Licking 👍\n<br />Sourdough Bread: Meh.. burnt at the side making it impossible to bite.
This place did not disappoint despite it being highly raved!!! All our options were really good! We got the Creamy mushrooms on sourdough with scrambled eggs ($12+3), the salmon soba noodles ($17) and the Atlas butterscotch banana pancake ($18). The portions were quite big as well and I would say it\'s a good price for what we got! Would definitely be back again! 
Thick and cushiony, their pancake reminded me of a fragrant vanilla cake, albeit a flattish one. The crunchy cereal clusters and ice-cream were fantastic with it. Bananas, not so much, but that\'s because I only like them when they\'ve been turned into banana bread! 🙊
$17. The scrambled egg was excellent and one of the best that I had tasted, it was not overdone and some parts of the egg was runny. Definitely something that is worth it. The environment and ambience in the cafe is vibrant and its an amazing place to chill with good scenery. The creamy mushroom tasted strong and the cream made the bread very soft, making it easier to slice through as compared to portions of the bread which were under the scrambled eggs. The plating was perfect and designed with extreme skill. Also did not have to wait for a long time for the dish to come. Certainly one of the best cafes to go!
My first time trying piccolo latte, definitely something which I liked really much. There was a strong bitter aftertaste that enhanced the coffee. Not a coffee expert but I really loved it. Hope that the service would be better and they could serve water.
4 munchies: Topped with freshly-grated Parmesan and juicy shimeji cooked in creamy white wine sauce, the sides of the toasted sourdough were crispy and slightly chewy on the inside – perfect for wiping the plate clean with none of the delish sauce left! The buttery, semi-runny scrambled eggs and sausages (though I find them a tad small) make great add-on options for a heaping plate of breakfast.
Diz chicken stew is da bomb! Highly recommend it! ✔️✔️ The creamy savory broth w distinct herb flavors paired w that succulent soft chicken thigh &amp; crunchy sourdough is just amazeeeezang! The cherry tomato halfs also help to lift the cream base dish, adding a tad of zest &amp; prevents it from being too heavy &amp; gelat. Potato &amp; carrot cubes also compliments the dish, creating more textures &amp; depth. Do order this if you ever find yourself in Atlas! 🐋🌴 #weekendbrunch #dayum
At last, I finally made my way down to Atlas Coffeehouse. (See what I did there, haha)
Even though it was a tad sweet, might be due to us pouring the entire honey syrup, the pancakes that were served in a pan was soft and fluffy. The supposedly caramelized banana could have been a bit better as there was not a single hint of the charred flavour but the house-made butterscotch brought a nice crunch while the honey comb ice cream provided a nice balance of cold and warm from the pancakes.
Earl Grey Caramel Waffle $12, this crisp and dense waffle is drizzle with earl grey caramel sauce and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Pretty good. 🍓
Not your usual scrambled eggs brunch. This creamy mushroom served on sourdough will set you back just $14. Sausages at $3 and scrambled eggs at $3. Although their coffee was a tad burnt and disappointing, their lady grey tea was immaculate!
SO I\'VE FINALLY GOT TO TRY ATLAS COFFEEHOUSE! All thanks to Burpple\'s #TastyTastemakerTour!
The dessert that wraps up stop 1 of the Tasty Tastemaker Tour. On first look, this might look like a massive onslaught of sweetness all on one plate, especially with that generosity when it comes to the mixed berry compote and that scoop of vanilla ice-cream that accompanies them. I loved how the waffles here are always so ever fluffy, with a lingering Buttermilk fragrance that makes it so wonderful. The compote brings just a good amount of sweetness to the dish, so it comes with a good balance of sweet yet tart berry flavour while the vanilla ice-cream is smooth and aromatic — an ideal match to the waffles without being overwhelmingly sweet. Presentation wise it might be messy for some, but I personally find it fitting to the terminology \"beautiful mess\" pretty well!
Dish 2 of stop 1 for the Tasty Tastemaker Tour. My personal favorite dish to order at Atlas Coffeehouse for how wholesome it gets. It\'s a dish carrying a little Japanese element with it and seemingly not as brunchy as the Mushrooms on Toast, this is the dish that is suitable for a light meal. Glazed salmon was done just right, locking in the moistness yet being flaky with a hint of Teriyaki while it comes with shimeiji mushrooms that gives an earthy flavour that helps to mediate the savoury noodles. And of course, it helps that the fried egg is there to satisfy all your brunch fantasies regarding eggporn that comes with a little sprinkle of furikake just to spice things up a little. If all gets a little bit too flavoursome, have some of the Greek yogurt alongside that helps neutralize the palate, though personally I would prefer to have the dish without the Greek yogurt for I enjoyed every single bit of flavour that runs throughout this dish.
Dish 1 of stop 1 for the Tasty Tastemaker Tour. I have heard good things about this dish that had been raved by many who have had it before and was really looking forward to having it. Certainly not disappointed on how it turned out; runny scrambled eggs (an add-on that is highly recommended at $3 on top of the original price, umami sautéed shimeiji mushrooms in cream stop sourdough with shaved Parmesan, it\'s that dish you had always been dreaming about for breakfast when you wake up on weekends which made it totally apt for being the first item to be dished out on the tour.
Lovely space w plenty of natural light. Second visit to Atlas Coffeehouse saw me having their creamy mushrooms w scrambled eggs on sourdough ($17). Generous portion of eggs tho slightly overcooked. Wholesome brunch to start the day right 😊
Would love some Creamy Mushroom on Sourdough ($14) with scrambled eggs (+$3) for my lazy brunch today. \n<br />The sauce that went with the mushrooms were earthy and creamy. The eggs fluffy and light. My favourite part was soaking the sourdough into the umami cream...
This isn\'t a great place for working considering the crowd and echoes. They do have free WiFi, although it\'s as slow as a snail. Coffee is more on the acidic side, so it\'s not my favourite. But the cafe is pretty for photo-taking if you\'re closer to the windows.\n<br />#AtlasCoffeehouse #WorkHardAnywhere
Not my favourite pancake as the inside is too moist for my liking. The banana slices were the best part just because it\'s banana. 😅\n<br />#AtlasCoffeehouse #Pancake *
Even though it was a tad sweet, might be due to us pouring the entire honey syrup, the pancakes that were served in a pan was soft and fluffy. The supposedly caramelized banana could have been a bit better as there was not a single hint of the charred flavour but the house-made butterscotch brought a nice crunch while the honey comb ice cream provided a nice balance of cold and warm from the pancakes.
A cup of hot chocolate now will do wonders. As what Sheryl would say about this drink, it is hot and chocolatey.
Made for the mushroom lovers — White wine creamy mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese served over toasted sourdough. So rich, creamy and \"mushroomy\"!! Added some fluffy scrambled eggs too because I love all my breakfast and brunch (or actually any meal) with eggs!
Ordered the salted caramel waffles and the earl grey waffles (both $12) and the truffle fries ($8). Nominal prices and delicious food in a bustling little cafe!
Light and fluffy pancake served with caramelized banana, house made butterscotch and honey-comb ice cream. You can taste the crunchiness of the honeycomb bits. Warning: Highly addictive and quite a generous portion too. 😜
Creamy Mushroom on Sourdough + add on Scrambled Eggs ($17) was amazing. White wine creamy mushroom served on toasted sourdough bread. Add on a side of sunny side up/scrambled egg or sausage to make it a perfect brunch! 😋👍🏻
This is my Sis\'s standard cafe order. It was well done with light truffle-y fragrance. Not overwhelming. Just nice. But it was so safe a bet (ie. nothing exceptionally wow) that i wish we had ordered the buttermilk waffles instead. We saw the other table having theirs and it looked super delish😍
Added scrambled eggs to mine and boy was it a good idea. Possibly one of the places with awesome scrambled eggs. Just look at it 😍 moist and creamy but not too overwhelmingly \"eggy\"(if you know what i mean~). Love the creamy mushroom with white wine. I was mopping up all that sauce with my toast. Two thumbs up👍🏼👍🏼Cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! 
it\'s like all the bomb food textures rolled into a dish. the buttermilk waffles with vanilla ice cream and candied bacon at Atlas ($14.50) was so amazeballs I had dreams about it last night (8.4/10) #truestory seriously, this thing is LITTTT. 👊👊
Creamy Mushroom On Sourdough Toast @sgd 14.00 +scramble egg @sgd 3.00 ,u will love it if you are mushroom lover ,but I find it the mushroom given is too little ,but overall still satisfy with the disk ,pls be remind that usually are full house during the weekend ,come early and enjoy your brunch!no service charge only GST ,the staff is friendly too ！is worth trying ,overall rating :3.5/5 .
Once again the consistency and fluffiness of the \'giant\' pancake surprises me. This time, the savory Butterscotch Ice Cream melted and complemented the Caramelized Bananas (salty &amp; sweet). Personally, it was a tad sweet but for those of you craving for something sweet or have a sweet tooth, this dessert would be perfect! 4/5
This was an interesting rendition of Beef Brisket as it was textured more like Pulled Pork..the caramelized onions mixed well with the brisket presented a good balance of flavors. The sausages that accompanied the dish provided more proteins whilst the toasted bread was topple with some tomato sauce which provided some reprieve to all that protein. For me, everything with a Sunnyside Up was always welcomed! 😝 4/5
Too bad I\'m a slow eater :( the chicken thigh was tender and flavourful and stewed long enough that the soft bones and cartilage was soft enough to chew on *crunch crunch*. Nothing too great with the bread but no complaints since its just an accompanying side. \n<br />The base however was heaven, it\'s not thick at all and it was like soup. At least I treated it as such.. Love the flavour and the herbs infused in it. \n<br />Definitely returning for more. Place was pretty good except for the fact it was kinda loud making conversation difficult (bad design of the space i guess) \n<br />Food 4.1/5\n<br />Place 4/5 (bonus points being so cold as I was melting outside) \n<br />#atlascoffeehouse #burpple #chickenstew

By the same people behind Assembly Coffee comes Atlas Coffeehouse, an expansive, lofty Bukit Timah cafe decked out in marbled tiles and deep sea blue walls. Great for both quick coffee runs and long, lazy brunches, sail by for a Flat White ($4.50) and start the day with a relaxing read by the window bar. For brunch, get the ATLAS Super-Bowl ($17), a healthy yet tasty grain bowl filled with toasted quinoa, roasted squash and zucchini and tender peanut sesame pulled chicken. For more classic brunch flavours, go for the Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough ($12) — a generous heap of mushrooms cooked with a splash of white wine and sundried tomatoes, which you must pair with the silky smooth Scrambled Eggs ($3 for add on). For dessert, we favour the Mixed Berries Compote Waffles ($12.50) over the pancakes — they are similar in taste but the former is lighter and more affordable. Pro-tip: It gets a little crowded at lunch time, so it\'s best to pop by around 11am.
Bacon, Beans and Egg on Sourdough! The egg was well cooked with the yolk still semi runny. Sourdough was toasted to perfection and the beans &amp; sausages were pretty flavorful to complement each other. 4/5
The Breakfast Strawberry Maple Pancake was yummy, a simple afternoon delight to chase away the blues. Never had such a huge and thick pancake but to my surprise, it was really soft and fluffy with a nice crips on the edge! Absolutely divine pairing of sweet, sour and salty!! Must try 5/5
Deconstructed latte + the famed butterscotch pancake. Coffee should b drunk in order and with speed since mine turned cold fast: espresso, milk, latte. But by that heaven-of-a-pancake this place is awesome.
scrambled eggs and mushrooms in white wine sauce on a sourdough toast。#atlascoffeehouse
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4 stars IT\'S REALLY THICK! Taste somewhat pancake &amp; cake. It\'s too sweet for me, too much for 2, great for groups. note: 20 mins wait for fluffy thick pancake. Apple juice is bombtics😉
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4 Stars! Got to love the mushroom soak in cream with sourdough bread side of egg. The perfect combination for a hearty breakfast at bukit timah.
Having my usual cold brew at Atlas now. Life is pretty awesome.
The combination keeps me raving non-stop, the creaminess and yumminess is too wow. The omelette is perfection.
Pumpkins and sun dried tomatoes were super flavourful!!! Vv generous with their chicken too😊
Finally managed to pop by this new(ish) cafe to see what the fuss is about. I was not disappointed at all- the mix of flavours were really incredible. The soba noodles were an interesting change from the usual pasta, and goes better with the Japanesey flavours. I was quite impressed at the large slab of salmon it came with, which was cooked perfectly and super flaky. The portion could be slightly bigger through. Other than that, I would say that this is a winner!
Price: $7~. A soft and slightly sour lemon meringue pie. Great combination as always and nothing can quite go wrong with lemon meringue. (Unless of course you are trying to make one yourself.. Get the peaks right!) nothing super special but if you are along botanics and are looking for a sourish sweet desert, this is it. 
Price:$17. Not bad for a treat-yourself without going broke lunch. This summer chicken stew comes with 2 pieces of sour dough bread with chicken thigh and a creamy stew with carrot and potato. The stew had a good herb aroma and the creamy texture/taste was just right. Though I would personally prefer creamier versions. Haha. The chicken thigh was da bomb as the meat just falls so gracefully off the bone. Then meat was also really tender. The sour dough bread was also crunchy. Though I would really like it if they would give another piece. The potato and carrot cubes add another layer to this dish and they are the safe haven you can escape to when you fee that you had a bit too much meat. 
A revisit to Atlas Coffeehouse for some great food with @janicehelloo. Such good food makes the queuing time in the sweltering heat all the more justifiable 😌🙌🏻
My definition of an ideal breakfast. \n<br />At the airport waiting to board the flight to Ipoh now. More of my Ipoh\'s adventure on my snapchat (gabrielteomj) 🇲🇾
really in love with this beef brisket on toast!!!!! I thought the egg would be nicer scrambled (bc atlas does amazingly creamy scrambled eggs) tho haha but the beef was sooo tender and juicy! it was seasoned Asian style and that was rather cool bc I felt like I was having an angmoh style breakfast but with a nicely added homely feel 😌 definitely worth the try guys!!!! would pick this dish and the butterscotch pancake as my favourite dishes from Atlas
couldn\'t decide between the keylime and the lemon meringue and in the end we chose keylime because we didn\'t want something too sweet. I really love the strong citrusy sour-y taste to this pie but I still thought it was slightly too sweet. The flavours came on a little too strong so downing one whole pie by yourself may get abit gelat. 
felt a need for something savory today and made a special request to change ice cream to scrambled eggs and they acceded to my crazy idea.
Butterscotch Banana Pancake.\n<br />It\'s fluffy inside, it\'s as though eating a cake.\n<br />Sharing is caring works well here.
Indulged myself with this awesome earl grey caramel waffle yesterday. Crispy and fluffy buttermilk waffle topped with smooth and creamy vanilla ice cream, earl grey caramel sauce and sweet strawberries. \n<br />What more can I ask for? Best! \n<br />Have a great week ahead! 😊
The 2 must-trys if you have the stomach space.\n<br />Spun off from @assemblycoffee which will be closed after today. Yup, all good things come to an end. The new @atlascoffeehouse is a continuation and has more tables. Chapter✌🏼️
If you are a person that likes the French-styled pocket, you may want to consider this bowl of Summer Chicken Stew. The chicken is moist and tender - which was the kind of texture that I liked!! - simmered in a rich, cream based sauce made with sundried tomatoes, herbs, potatoes and carrots. The pieces of sourdough were just a perfect combination to go with the cream-based sauce. Surely the chicken was good since it was not dry and matches rather well with the sauce, and the price is still alright for something at a cafe. There are also no additional changes as well (since the last time I went in March 2016).
brunch with a view! the mushroom ragout dod not disappoint, tasted really awesome 😋
Don\'t think I will ever be hahaha. Super dope {Banana Butterscotch Pancakes} plus the deconstructed {Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough} at the back coz the hungry girl couldn\'t wait HAHA 😂😘
It was worth the waiting time of almost 30 minutes. I love how fluffy the pancake was even though it looked really thick. This would be something a sweet tooth (like me!) will love especially with the strong Butterscotch ice cream and addictive Honeycomb crunches. The only disappointment was with my iced latte that was way too bitter and acidic (perhaps it\'s over-extracted?). Other than that, it\'s a good place to chillax with such a comforting interior.
This was definitely a let down, the brisket was dry and slightly tough. \n<br />Perhaps serving it with a sauce might have been better. On the bright side I had 2 other amazing dishes here. \n<br />PS: monster was distracted by the red pants as well. Haha
When one orders scrambled eggs, it should come like this, smooth, silky &amp; creamy. \n<br />On the side note, I must say the interior of this store is gorgeous! #housegoals in the making.
creamy mushroom on sourdough ($12) with added scrambled eggs ($3)--great move because the scrambled eggs were excellent! possibly the best i\'ve had in a cafe. highly recommended dish! candied bacon buttermilk waffle ($14) came with fluffy waffles, topped with vanilla bean ice-cream &amp; sweet charred bacon. generous portions all-around. mocha ($5) was alright.
❤️ it when it\'s shows up creamy and equally tasty
BACK AT ATLAS and their waffles r amazing!!! got the earl grey one and tbh can\'t really taste the earl grey but the amazing texture makes up for it all man :-) it was so so SO crispy but yet so fluffy in the middle and the salted caramel added a nice toffee flavor!!! I thought the strawberries were out of place but other than that this waffle deserves a 11/10 man super worth the $12! 
Candied bacon waffles ($14) with ice cream 🍦 on top. It\'s sweet 🍬 and hits the right spot. And there\'s no service charge here!
Such a huge and YUMMY PORTION, even explodingbelly cannot finish it!
A pleasant breakaway from brunch dishes that have been done to death. Salmon was pink and moist, though I’d prefer not to have the blob of yogurt on top - it kind of dilutes the marinate? The crunchy shimeiji mushrooms, soba noodles, salmon and fried egg played harmoniously together, however the scant portions only suffice for a small japanese koto piece.
Bacon and eggs are always a good idea. Even more so when they\'re served atop juicy shreds of Atlas\' slow-cooked pulled beef and caramelised onions, with crusty, slightly chewy sourdough to pad them up.
Aldente soba and Glazed salmon with marinated shimeji mushroom and egg.
Aldente soba and Glazed salmon with marinated shimeji mushroom and egg.
Banana pancakes with butterscotch sauce and hokey pokey ice cream is a clear winner and a common find on every table. Only wish they would allow us to order an extra serving of ice cream.
So I thought atlas was going to be another one of those overrated cafes but NOPE sure it was very crowded which kindda ruined the ambiance a little BUT the food was so so so SO good this is climbing up my fav list!!!! This hugantic pancake was not gelat at all and the butterscotch flavor was so strong it was absolutely delicious. It had the crunchy edge and the pillowy centre like a good pancake would AND THE MOST DELICIOUS CORNFLAKE BITS ever! really worth the wait and the price :-)!! the only downside is that the proportion could be improved as I had a huge chunk of pancake left after that! (or maybe I just gobbled up the delicious honey coated cornflakes too quickly) I would say this is better than the hotcakes that everyone has been having!!!!
slightly expensive as we added the scrambled eggs but the scrambled eggs were amazing and really one of the best I\'ve had! Unbelievably creamy and silky; seasoned to perfection! The mushrooms however, were not as outstanding even though it was supposed to be the star of the dish. Serving size is rather small as well for a $15 platter! (I know it looks big but everything is just nicely spread out, the layers are actually really thin) This is could give artistry\'s scrambled eggs a run for their money! Flat white was great (really low on acidity) but took really long to come :-( it came when we were almost done with our food!!! minus points for that :-  ( 
The waffle was crispy and fluffy on the inside. The ice cream and berries fitted well with the waffles, creating a juicy yet crispy masterpiece in your mouth!! If you are a fan of crispy waffles, this $12.5 waffle would be your next target💓
Big open window for natural lighting, good service and most importantly the food is GOOD. \n<br />Nice pour flat white. I ordered the creamy mushroom on sourdough and add on scrambled egg. Loved the idea of adding sun dried tomato into the creamy mushroom and topped with cheese. Good balanced of flavors which created comfort. \n<br />Will return to try out their pancake and chicken stew.
.\n<br />Probably Japanese inspired, one can expect shimeiji mushroom and poached salmon tossed in cold soba noodles. Oh and not forgetting the carrot, but is a nono for me.
Atlas AGAIN. Mixed berry compote waffle with ice cream was a perfect Sunday afternoon sweet treat! And of course, blood type: iced latte, so that was an obvious choice. 
White Wine Creamy Mushrooms served on Toasted Sourdough, Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
Cold brew ($6) was great on a hot day but I would have preferred a stronger flavor in the coffee. 
Luscious butterscotch and honeycomb ice cream melting in steady torrents over slices of ripe bananas fanned out on a voluptuous hotcake-sponge cake hybrid – this itself a fluffy pillow of aerated banana-infused batter.
Because Fry-day!
Start your day right with awesome breakfast. Missing this dish by @atlascoffeehouse called Creamy Mushroom on Sourdough which was really good, creamy but didn\'t feel greasy eating it. 👍🏻
The chicken is really tender but i felt that the dish was a little too salty! But overall, the taste and texture is good! It would be my perfect choice of comfort food for a rainy day! 
Brunch at Atlas is thoroughly satisfying. I particularly enjoyed this classic British breakfast and my flat white. On a week day morning things are slow and beautiful in this space. It was the perfect spot to get lost in a book for awhile! I\'m so glad that it is so near to my house! 
Who says that healthy food ain\'t tasty?! The Atlas Super Bowl was packed with nutritious stuff - think quinoa, baby spinach, pumpkin, mushrooms, sundries tomatoes and the yummiest grilled eggplant! Good for your health, and your tastebuds too. Super inspired to make my own now 😍 #xuannyeatsclean #eatclean #cafehoppingsg #burpple #healthy #foodspotting #foodporn #foodstamping
The fluffy kind of texture, together with crispy edges on them makes this dish totally enticing. Anw, did a short review on the web, link in bio 🤓
Salmon soba noodles ($17) sounds deceptively simple, yet made outstanding in the hands of the amazing chefs at @atlascoffeehouse! The noodles were tossed with an addictive sauce, and the dish was infused with Japanese flavours that tasted light, yet oh-so-delicious. #burpple #cafehoppingsg #foodspotting #foodporn #foodstamping
Finally made the trip down to Atlas in between my lecture breaks. Trying their Apple Crumble Pie for the very first time and the chunks of caramalised apples were really huge and aptly sweet with a soft crunch. While I wish the crumbles were a little less mushy, I must say that they are really generous with that scoop of ice-cream that looks improportionately gigantic compared to the slice of pie!
A mini latte or a giant macchiato? \n<br />Regardless, this supposed double shot with 3 ounce of milk was really good! (Like a latte with lesser milk!) Also, if you really need to wake up 😹
How good was the food? Let\'s just say we ended up scrapping the plates clean with our forks. In fact my parents are already talking about when we\'re gonna go back hahaha, can\'t wait till then! #Burpple
Compared with all the thick pancakes that have exploded into Singapore\'s cafe scene, this is one of my favourites. A fluffy pancake infused with berry bits within the flour and the sweetest raspberries and strawberries ever! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
After having the ricotta hotcakes at Barry\'s in Melbourne I\'ve been missing the fluffiest pancake I\'ve ever eaten (I haven\'t eaten much fluffy pancakes tbh 🙄). So when I saw this pic going ard I knew I had to try it 😍 The butterscotch banana pancakes ($18) were as fluffy as Agnes\' unicorn. I think there were butterscotch sauce in the pancake itself which I couldn\'t tell because it was in the middle and by the time I reached the middle of the pancake I was already sweetened up by the butterscotch drizzle on the outside. Was expecting caramelised bananas (because pancakes and caramelised bananas are a match made in heaven ok trust me I am an expert) but it was just normal bananas topped with ice cream and honeyed cornflakes. 😟 unfortunately ¾ into the pancakes I totally maxed out my sweet intake for the day. Definitely a dish for sharing. 
A heady mix of rosemary tickled our tastebuds the moment this dish was delivered to the table. The chicken was beautifully done, fork-tender, and bathed in a fragrant, yet surprisingly light stew. I would return again and again for the food here. Reasonably-priced, gorgeously plated and absolutely delicious. Everything I could ask for on a Sunday morning (and more). 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Love the fluffiness of the thick pancake, sweeten with butterscotch and honeycomb/cereal to add a little crunch to the whole equation. Topped with a huge serving of good old vanilla ice cream. Good for sharing but I find it a little pricy at $18.
I personally like the scrambled egg with creamy mushrooms as well as the butterscotch banana pancake. 🍳
Whilst the mixed berries compote scythes at you with the seductively tarty vengeance of a most coquettish minx, the usually reliable waffle, though internally still proficient, had the wizened, sun-weathered skin of a Punggol-living septuagenarian. 3.5/5
Not a fan of pancakes/waffles because I get tired of their doughiness by the first few bites. But this! So fluffy and thick! The pancake shape kinda reminds me of a giant dorayaki. 
This could be one of my favourite cafes at the moment! Being a Eastie this place was a little far for me to get to. But the food and drinks were awesome. The strawberry pancake smelt SO GOOD. ❤️
White wine creamy mushrooms with freshly grated parmesan, served on toasted sourdough. You can add $3 for scrambled eggs or sausages. We went for the former that was soft and runny, which was just perfect for me.
Promising the same good waffles as per Assembly Coffee, the waffles here are similarly delish and flawless. We chose the Earl Grey Caramel one, which star waffles aside had stunning flavours. The earl grey caramel was distinctly floral, though a tad powdery in texture. My favourite was the fresh and macerated berries that came with: perfect with the vanilla ice cream.
$18. Photogenic but too sweet for my liking. The honeycomb ice cream and the caramelised cornflakes provided a nice crunch but the syrup and the sweet pancake was too much. 
Seriously spoiled by ATLAS. After them it\'s like I can\'t muster the effort to try elsewhere! The food\'s really that good. The Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough here is a perfect example: simple scramble done well, topped with umami creamy shrooms laced with sweet roasted cherry tomatoes.
$15. Absolutely delicious and decently priced too. Though simple, one of the best brunch dishes I\'ve had. The highlight was definitely the mushrooms in the creamy umami sauce soaking the bread. Highly recommend! 
Their Signature fluffy pancake, served with caramelized banana and house-made butterscotch and honey comb ice-cream is really unique and yummy! \n<br />The pancake is fluffy on the inside yet crispy on the outside, I specially love the chunks of sugar-coated corn flakes which gives us a nice bite and is totally addictive. The caramelized banana and butterscotch-honeycomb ice-cream adds a nice finishing touch to this whole dish as well.
Consisting of poached salmon dressed in house-made yoghurt served on soba noodles, and topped with roasted shimeji mushrooms and crispy egg, I absolutely love this Japanese-inspired dish. \n<br />The soba noodles was cooked till al dente, while the mushrooms add a chewy bite. Salmon was tender, and topped with nori. A pity the egg yolk was over-done, i would have prefer a runny yolk.
We came to this 1 month-old cafe, along Duke\'s Road, which is coincidentally the sister cafe of Assembly Coffee. \n<br />Upon reaching, I saw an old industrial warehouse lookalike building, with a minimalist interior. \n<br />Baby ordered this BBQ bacon baked beans on toast (S$16), which is essentially like a big breakfast set consisting of slow cooked bacon and baked beans, Italian pork sausages, sunny egg, served on sourdough toast. \n<br />This classic breakfast set was nice but nothing to shout about.
Their signature pancake is fluffy and has a buttery golden crunch on the outside. However, instead of sourish berries, they choose a sweeter version: caramelised bananas together with delicious house-made butterscotch &amp; honeycomb ice cream!! Pretty big portion too, so recommend to share.
Unfortunately, the Cold Brew left much to be desired. I thought it was average - preferred the Latte which was robust &amp; delicious.
Stewed Beef &amp; Sausages with Caramelised Onions on Sourdough Toast ($18) - definitely for the meat lovers. This was tasty! Can\'t seem to find anyone else online (with a public account) who has eaten this &amp; posted about it so far..
Creamy Mushrooms with Scrambled Eggs on Sourdough Toast 🍄🍳🍞 ($12 for mushrooms &amp; toast + $3 for the eggs) 
But this is a pretty nice corner at Atlas to play with shadow &amp; light.
Ventured in search of caffeine to fuel our souls today and decided to try out Atlas Coffeehouse. The interior is sleek, however the echoes can be a little loud with all the chatter. Amplified sounds like falling chairs sends the noisy cafe into a horrifying silence whilst everyone stares at the person who loudly interrupted their conversation (luckily I wasn’t the clumsy one today).\n<br />The ATLAS Super-bowl was supposed to have toasted quinoa. However, I just thought the quinoa was a bit too mushy and couldn’t tell how it was toasted at all. The best part of the bowl was the sundried tomatoes and shimeiji mushrooms—they were the only outstanding flavours in the bowl. It would’ve been great if the ratio of quinoa was higher vs. maybe the chicken, but that just be me cos I like my grains.\n<br />Was really disappointed with the coffee here though. We were told that the flat white supposedly contains 2 shots of espresso here, but it was so milky we felt it consisted of less than even 1 shot. Maybe it was the blend, in which case it’s a SUPER mild one. Didn’t get a good coffee fix today. =(\n<br />#AtlasCoffeehouse #Coffee
Atlas\'s Butterscotch Banana Pancake - Signature fluffy pancake served with banana and honeycomb ice cream! \n<br />The interior fluffiness of the pancake tasted like banana cake while the exterior was SO crispy it actually amazed me how good it tasted with the combination when you top it up with the ice cream! The portion is so big it can be considered a main meal by its own or can be shared as a dessert by 2 pax as well! Takes 20 minutes for the preparation time but then, it\'s totally worth it! Definitely worth ordering 👍🏻
Wide space between each table, the mains here however taste pretty decent though. \n<br />Poached Salmon with Soba - Meh, nothing really special about this. Thought it will be spectacular, but nope haha and quite an expensive dish though ($17), guess it\'s due to the rental I guess?
Second time here this week cause what to do, the food is lovely and the place is too! Here, the slow-roasted chicken thigh seats on a bed of roasted potatoes and carrots, bathed in a lovely sundried-tomato cream broth. Sounds like a lot going on, but the flavours are astonishingly balanced and complementary. The veggies added a mellow sweetness; the sundried tomatoes lent delightful tang; and the dash of cream brought it all together as a rich, flavourful, yet light-tasting meal.
Chill vibes x Great coffee x Unpretentious food 
$8 - a sip of crazy strong espresso, followed by sweet steamed milk that downplays the acidity of the former; and then the final cuppa - a perfect marriage of both into a beautifully made latte.
Crispy exterior yet maintaining an extremely light and fluffy interior of chewy goodness! Crunchy cornflakes added to the exterior texture, and with lip-smacking melting ice cream, what more can you ask for? Would gobble this up in a heartbeat. ❤️ You would have to wait 20+ mins for preparation, but trust me - it\'s so worth it! Great for sharing with friends over a hot cuppa too :-)
Super pretty whilst on the tray, but presentation aside, it was pretty average taste-wise. Too crumbly of a tart shell for my liking and the filling was slightly too sweet (maybe it\'s just me - I love my citrusy desserts sour) 
Not just the pancake; but the one who dragged himself up at 10.30am, stood through an hour\'s train ride, and queued 45 minutes for a dish he doesn\'t even like! All because he knows imma foodie (with a blog to keep up). 
[Jan \'16] I\'m not sure if Atlas Coffeehouse still has this on their menu, but I do recall a lot of people being head over heels for this. It definitely looks amazing, but I can\'t say that I totally loved this. I don\'t really remember why though - it could\'ve been challenging portion, the lack of ice-cream or its sickly sweetness. 😬
have always been a fan of assembly coffee waffle but the salted caramel waffle here lacks that fragrance from the one down the road.
Interesting menu selection! We had the mushrooms on Sourdough, Japanese soba noodles with grilled salmon and MY GOD. You have got to try the Butterscotch Pancakes! It\'s to die for! :) Will come back for the pancakes for sure!
As an avid mushroom fan, the star of the dish were really the creamy shimeji mushrooms. A meal of mushrooms, scrambled eggs on sourdough; simple dish but so much flavours that complimented each other so well. A really enjoyable brunch after a long while ☺️ the Salmon Soba was the more unconventional and interesting dish. The yoghurt dressing with seaweed sauce had a good balance of sour with the slight hint of sweetness in the noodles. The runny yolk from the sunny side up, when mixed with the soba, added another dimension of flavours to the dish. Would definitely be back again 😁
A pretty good dessert that is the sweeter alternative to the Key Lime Pie here for the fluffy and light torched meringue, which comes with a kiss of zingy flavour from the lemon curd. The same, buttery cookie-like crust that holds up the Key Lime Pie exists here too!
Pretty much similar to Tonic Coffee at Percolate, which carries a slight bitter-ish yet sweet tinge to an iced black but without all the fizziness. Pretty intriguing and also potent; definitely not for the weak!
.\n<br />While there are a few renditions of hotcakes, I would say this is quite decent. Pancake base is not too heavy which goes well with butterscotch and honeycomb ice cream.\n<br />.\n<br />But preparation time for this is 20mins, so probably have to get something else to stuff the stomach meantime.
covered in nutella and raspberry sauce.
Thick, soft, eggy brioche slathered with generous amount of Nutella, then topped with berries compote and rich vanilla ice cream... This combination could not get any better! 😋
The Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough (S$12) + scrambled egg (S$3) were delicious with a rich buttery sauce that had a slight tarty flavour likely due to the addition of tomatoes. The egg seemed a bit too well done though. Coffee and ambience were great, nice place to chill out. Review coming soon on http://ingredientsofhappiness.wordpress.com ☺️
From the same people behind Assembly Coffee at Evans Road comes Atlas Coffeehouse, a place where they believe you can be \"at land and sea\". In contrast to the homey, cosy vibe at Assembly, Atlas boasts a generous space and a lofty ceiling, complete with a deep blue theme and marbled tiles. Expect crowd-pleasing brunch options like the Creamy Mushroom on Sourdough ($12), and the ATLAS Butterscotch Banana Pancake ($18) — a fluffy pancake with caramelised bananas, and a dollop of butterscotch and honeycomb ice cream (a 20-minute wait, totally worth it). Fans of Assembly\'s signature buttermilk waffles will be glad to see them on the menu here. It\'s good to also see a healthy, tasty option in the form of The ATLAS Super-Bowl ($17) — a bed of toasted quinoa topped with baby spinach, shimeiji mushrooms, roasted veggies and a generous scoop of peanut sesame pulled chicken. Located just five minutes from Botanic Gardens MRT (it\'s taken over the old Mad Jack\'s, if you knew it), drop by for a Flat White ($4.50) if you\'re in the area, made with a blend of Guatamalan and Brazilian beans from Two Degrees North Coffee Co.
I chose to add on a sunny-side up egg, but I highly recommend you get the scrambled instead. My friend ordered scrambled, which looked and tasted so much better. Nevertheless, this dish was still so yummy! I loved how creamy and delicious the mushrooms was, and with the combination of chewy and fluffy on the inside while crispy on the outside sourdough bread - I was brought up to carbs heaven. 
The mushrooms were smooth and divine mmmmmm... And they were out of sour dough so I was offered brioche which I would take over sour dough anytime. The scrambled eggs were extremely disappointing - looks nice and creamy on the outside but was way overcooked (for my liking) on the inside, not unlike the scrambled eggs from MacDonalds. I had high expectations of the dish after tasting the mushrooms but the eggs really need to be fixed. \n<br />On a side note, that plate is gorgeous!
ATLAS Butterscotch Banana Pancake featuring signature fluffy pancake served with caramelized banana and house-made butterscotch &amp; honey comb ice cream. The wait is 20 minutes, but it’s worthwhile for the soft and tasty pancakes. 
The dish arrived like it is good for two to share, with sumptuous shimeiji mushroom cooked in a mid-rich cream sauce piled on a light-toasted sourdough bread. The kitchen got everything just right, from the creaminess of the sauce, chewiness of the bread, to the combination of ingredients.
.\n<br />Healthy quinoa, healthy spinach, healthy zucchini and so on. Like what we concluded, a western-style bibimbap.\n<br />.\n<br />It tasted good too, really. But not my usual food option which I wasn\'t left with much choices as those which caught my attention was sold out yesterday.\n<br />.\n<br />So much for getting excited over new places and putting in effort on travelling time. Tsk.
The dusky earl grey beauty vanishes into the night as mysteriously as she appeared, whilst elsewhere the waffle maintains a light crisp on the outside while having a buttery 3-ply softness on the inside. 4/5
Now I can finally be a less whiny girlfriend when I wait for @mokkked to finish his work at CCAB because. COFFEE.\n<br />.\n<br />🚇 Botanic Gardens. 6 Duke\'s Road. Singapore 268886.\n<br />(Just before Crown Bakery)
Quite enjoyed this even though I do not really take noodles. This would serve as a good lunch/brunch savoury options, for those who wish to have more proteins. I think I might just request for a knob of butter next time and toss it with the noodles! It is just me. 😂🤗 Key Lime Pie - We were deciding whether to get the lemon meringue pie or this. Eventually, we settled for key lime pie as it is not as commonly found as the other. If not for the guys, I think I can finish this by myself. Great balance of tanginess and subtle sweetness. The super buttery crust was able to hold its shape well without being too hard. I would order this again for my cheat meal and pair it with a cup of long black. 🙊
Coffee beans from Two Degrees North Coffee Co, a blend which consists of 70% Brazil and 30% Guatemala. Likewise for the flatwhite, love the smooth and velvety taste with a chocolatey and nutty tone. With the great coffee, bigger space, and more natural lighting, I can foresee myself coming back here often!🙆🏻 Head over to my burpple account for food review later!\n<br />Open 8am to 5pm daily except Mondays.

From Atlas Coffeehouse at 6 Duke\'s Road, by the same people behind Assembly Coffee. Assembly Coffee is pretty much known for their stellar waffles, and pretty glad that Atlas Coffeehouse does their waffles pretty well too. Crisp exterior with a plush, fluffy interior, their Earl Grey Caramel Waffles come with a light tea aroma accompanied by the sweetness of caramel. Vanilla ice-cream was able to sustain our long photography session, and went well with the waffles and the fresh strawberries.
Atlas Coffeehouse does their bakes in-house, such as this Key Lime Pie. This was pretty good, with strong citrusy zinginess within the smooth curd that makes it distinctively Key Lime. Crust was also well done for it carried cookie-like flavours with a hint of butter; held up the pie pretty well without crumbling into a mess. Great to pair with a cup of coffee!
From Atlas Coffeehouse situated at 6 Duke\'s Road by the people behind Assembly Coffee. Described as \"Glazed Salmon, Soba Noodles, Fried Egg\" on the menu, this was a Japanese-inspired dish that replicates pasta. Buckwheat Noodles tossed with a hint of Nori flavour, the noodles were done al-dente while the salmon was well-marinated and carried a savoury, strong grilled flavour though the skin could be perhaps crispier for better texture. What surprised me was the fried egg though; totally crisp on the underside for the white which made it pretty intriguing!
The grilled white miso eggplant was my favourite of all the toppings, but all the charred vegetables actually went really well with the quinoa. Quite liked the soft and tender pulled chicken as well. I feel the entire bowl was made for those who were lazy to chew on their food (re: me). Wish the portion was bigger but having this superbowl with their coffee was quite filling to be honest.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #healthy #food #protein #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat

Next time, promise! 🤞🏻Good thing that Atlas Coffeehouse has sourdough. And it never disappoint! I loved how the creamy mushroom sauce soaked into the toasted sourdough.  Atop with generous mushrooms, grated parmesan and added with lots of bacon strips. This dish is a must-have!

I remember this used to be fluffier a while back... #BurppleXChope
And no wonder this is recommended based on reviews! Waffles were really crispy and light, and the mixed berry compote wasn\'t as tart as I expected it to be and leaned more towards the sweet side. So the combination of vanilla ice cream, honey, berry together with the waffle was rly good. To be frank I wasn\'t very satisfied with the main I got - the Atlas Hash - maybe because I prefer the potato hash to be a little less mushy / cooked and more like rosti. It came with a sunny side up, sausages, bacon and arugula too. I liked the bacon though, and I don\'t usually do. My friends ordered the cereal prawn garlic pasta and the salmon soba. The former seemed a little disappointing cause there was only one prawn but the aglio olio-like pasta was guud. Salmon soba was a recommended dish too but I didn\'t fancy the soba cause of the carrots but my friend liked it! Would definitely come back for the waffles though! I wanna try the earl grey one ☺️ We made reservations via their Facebook page so we beat the queue! They only accept reservations for 8-1045 and 3-6, so we chose to have brunch at 1045 which was actually a good timing. Also quite decently priced in my opinion, like the typical cafe food price. And it\'s a 5 min walk from Botanic Gardens MRT which is a big plus. #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #8dayseat #sgfood #sgfoodies #atlascoffeehouse #waffles #brunch
The pancakes were soft and fluffy, and the candied sugar cornflakes, bananas and vanilla ice cream went well together. I was initially afraid of a sugar overload to the extent of gelatness but it didn\'t taste too sweet! Great ambience, lighting and service!! Will save up for future visits to try the rest of the items on their menu! #burpple #atlascoffee #atlastcoffeeeee #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #exploresingapore #onthetable #whati8today

Scramble Egg is nice!!! 😋😋
#Okthatsall #kthxbye
Taste similar to one of their brunch item. In a good way tho. The same fragrant mix of shimeiji mushroom and bacon in creamy sauce. If it ain\'t broke, why fix it right? (Side note, i shared this with the sister. If eating it on my own i would have found it too heavy to finish the whole plate going by how thick and creamy the sauce is)
Like a McWings upgrade. Yummy and shiok. 👍🏼
Now if only I could spend all my hump days here...

This warm bowl of succulent chicken leg soaking in creamy tomato broth that tasted so tangy and flavourful, together with roasted carrots and potatoes and toasted brioche to just wipe the bowl clean with! This dish was really impressive, and instantly warmed me up in this cold rainy afternoon. Really glad to find that the cafe wasn\'t really packed as opposed to the crazy queues that is common here during weekends.

I have been having them from Strangers\' Reunion to Assembly. @deafkneego has the right waffle mix and perhaps the best hands in making these. The slight crisp on the outside opens up to a moist interior. The firm and then soft first bite has that satisfying texture combination. The salted caramel and ice cream only dresses up the real star on the plate. The last time I was here, the waffles were far from this standard; and I am glad I came back for a second bite. #fujifilmxe1 + #fujinon18mm #burpple #burpplesg #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #nomsterofficial #waffles #saltedcaramel #atlascoffeehouse #sgcafe #igsg #igsgfoodies #sgig #sgigfoodies

Egg on point
Atlas coffeehouse has it! Cooked in white wine sauce, it has a creamy texture paired with scramble egg ($17) heavenly. The mixed berries compote on top of the buttermilk waffles($13.50) has a unique flavor to it then top up with vanilla ice cream. Only one word to discribe both of the dish, mouth watering! Taste it to believe it!
This was our beautiful \"burppling\" messy but delish waffles. Crispy and fluffy with juicy blueberries to tone down the sweetness.\n<br />Great and fun company with loads of laughter and madness😄
Atlas is incredibly crowded at 9 am.
All the good stuff in a bowl - quinoa, sun dried tomatoes, baby spinach, roasted squash and parmesan zucchini, shimeiji mushrooms and peanut sesame pulled chicken. Surprisingly yummy!\n<br />The cafe was super noisy though 😒 \n<br />#omnomnom #burpple #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #burpplecafemonth #whati8today #tryingtoeatclean #vscocam

I love salmon! The salmon served with the special sauce complimented well with the added seaweeds. But the whole combination with the soba, is a big nono to me 🙅
Always love a latte in the afternoon. The same people who brought us Assembly Coffee are behind this lovely new joint. Coffee is just as good and ambience was perfect for a laid back afternoon chill out session. 
Shared this Breakfast Strawberry Maple Pancake with @krezhong and it was still too much for us to finish. Best to share among three or more friends! 👭👬 Love how thick the pancake is — more to mop up all the maple syrup! Can\'t wait to be back to try more items on the menu — Atlas Super Bowl, I\'m coming for you! 😋😋😋 #burpple #flatlayforever #foodandflatlay #tablesituation #foodstyling #pantone #snipsnapfood #storyofmytable #whywhiteworks #whyteworks #instafood_sg #instaeats #vscoeats #tastediary #f52grams #sgfoodie #AColorStory #acolorstorychallenge #flatlayforever #flatlay #dessertgram #whiteismine #morningslikethese #sgfood #awwsamsweettooth

You decide.... Ice black gives a more fruity and floral taste note of the coffee while Ice White usually give a nutty, chocolaty and milky taste of the coffee. \n<br />#latteart \n<br />#burpple \n<br />#podcult\n<br />#hobikopi \n<br />#anakkopi\n<br />#coffeelife\n<br />#instagram\n<br />#latteartist\n<br />#coffeelover \n<br />#baristadaily\n<br />#coffeeaddict \n<br />#cravenonstop\n<br />#culturadelcafe\n<br />#coffeeNquotes\n<br />#coffeeuniverse\n<br />#manmakecoffee\n<br />#thecoffeefusion\n<br />#thecoffeestation\n<br />#thetrendybarista\n<br />#alternativebrewing\n<br />#masfotokopi\n<br />#mbakfotokopi\n<br />#thetrendybarista \n<br />#video_tutorial\n<br />#trendingvideo \n<br />#coffeeandkindness\n<br />#latteartgram\n<br />#videomasak

Uh no.
😂 Hahaha but really this was very good btw!! Not too cloying and sweet though it\'s bound to make you feel very full afterwards haha.
my suggestion is to spilt to 2 thinner pieces as eating the current thick version, halfway through I just feel its just too filling to eat anymore... #throwback #latergram #Breakfast #brekkie #brunch #altascoffeehouse #food #dukesroad #bukittimah #foodie #linefoodie #sgfoodie #sgfood #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehopping #burpple #burpplesg #qiangxxuan #pancake #fondmemories

And the scrambled eggs were fluffy yet silky at the same time. Good portion to fill your tummy - I\'ll be back for this again! 😋🙆
Creamy scrambled eggs and mushrooms on sourdough
This new cafe replaced what used to be a western food and bicycle shop.

Third time here and I\'m still yearning to go back again hahaha!
The texture was just right!

Using blends from Two Degrees North Coffee Company, the Gibraltar here carries a strong body with an earthy flavour profile that is great for a wake-me-up for the higher coffee to milk ratio.
Featuring the ATLAS Butterscotch Banana Pancake [$18], Earl Grey Caramel Buttermilk Waffles [$12] and Truffle Fries [$8]. Pancakes ftw! Eat it fast before it soaked up all the sauce 🍴
how I wish it wasn\'t Monday yet.
Umami goodness. 👍🏻 [$17]\n<br />#howtonotbefat #burpple

this was a tad too fishy for my liking, but hey it\'s the long weekend!

@AtlasCoffeehouse brews the lightly acidic @2degreesnorth\n<br /> roasts that resonates all a little too faintly even in a piccolo latte. #onthetable: {Beef Brisket and onions on sourdough} - a tidy portion for a $18 price tag made slightly more affable only 2 sunny side up eggs\n<br />●\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #Whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood #burpple #hungrygowhere #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders #eyecandySorted #eggporn
Was a really good hearty waffles :) 
Loving the coffee and the atypical food offerings on the menu at Atlas Coffeehouse so far, will go back and visit to try more dishes soon :) the Lemon Meringue Pie is also really yummy mmm... visit ingredientsofhappiness.wordpress.com for the full #blog post :) #burpple #food #foodblog
Whilst the sour, vinegary noodles played it nice and cool, the salty glazed salmon possessed a Hermione Granger class participation-esque enthusiasm to gain favour with flavour. 3.6/5

A different kinda chicken stew which is more brothy. @atlascoffeehouse #newopening #cafesg #brunch #burpple #burpplesg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #i8mondays #8dayseat #sgfoodies #bloggerssg #singaporeeats #stfoodtrending #tripadvisor #singaporeinsiders #foodstagram
Good stuff. Ice cream in your iced choc? That\'s the way to go man. Loved everything, props to the people from Assembly. 
didn\'t eat my fav waffles but tried this new toast.
Something different at @atlascoffeehouse from the all the ricotta berry Hotcake variants out there.  But also heavier so shared this between 2-3 (or maybe 4) people.
A lot more as accessible, spacious and with a brand new food menu.
Expect brunch fare, pancakes, waffles (the earl grey caramel sounds wicked) and good coffee.
