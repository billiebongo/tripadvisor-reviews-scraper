somethings change, somethings wont. good old times here to stay - kek\'s moonlight horfun! savory but slightly heavy handed masked the good wok hei that day.
pork liver would be your usual suspect but not if it is at the new hands of kek at pandan gardens. mod sin, progressive zi char as the media calls it, this is claypot not pork but calf liver. because calf, tenderness was highly enjoyable and absence of gamey taste that you would usually associate. suggestively, even a subtle sweet taste to it. piping hot and molten thick savory sauce in claypot guarantees a more than usual rice intake. die hard fans of KEK need not worry as hard core signatures like their chilli and pepper crabs and moonlight hor fun are here to stay. but i say, why stay at comfort zone and lets give our favourite zichar dishes a new interpretation and new breadth of life!
New Favorite and delicious Chi Zhar at my place. Now i can just drop by to KEK to have a nice food. Nothing can be beaten with KEK Salted Egg Spaghetti ! Nice ! Satisfied
Exclusive to the Pandan Gardens outlet in the Tapas section of the Mod-C menu, this felt like a replica of what is usually served in dimsum restaurants. Prawn and mango wrapped in a golden brown exterior with mayo drizzled, KEK\'s variants trump certain dimsum outlets; the fried skin is so crisp without feeling greasy while the mango is soft and nearly pur√©e-like within, with fresh plump prawn in each piece. The mayo adds a creamy flavour to the natural sweetness of the mango, which is gives it a refreshing sweet-savour combination. Sold at $4/piece, and minimum of two; we ordered three pieces, and each piece is served halved.
KEK Seafood\'s (also known as Keng Eng Kee Seafood) signature at Alexandra is also served at the Pandan Gardens outlet, which serves a selection of what is available at Alexandra and also a new menu they call Mod-C (Modern Cze Char). Served in a personal portion wok, the hor fun here is pretty much the same flavour as the original, perhaps only less the peppery flavours. Still sweet from the dark sauce and carrying the wok hei that makes the original addictive, it comes with loads of goodies like pork lard, sausages and sotong, not forgetting the egg yolk that makes everything more silkier and palatable after being mixed. There is an option of two different sizes at different prices; the one featured here is the small portion at $6.
One of the new items exclusive to KEK Pandan Gardens under the Mod-C menu. This features fried Halibut in a peranakan-style sauce, which seems to involve the use of Assam which gave the sauce a zesty flavour with a mild spiciness akin to Sambal Stingray which was refreshing when had together with the fish. A pretty interesting and innovative dish served at a zichar stall.
Also exclusively available at KEK Seafood Pandan Gardens in the Tapas section of the Mod-C menu, the Chinese name of this dish translates to \"KEK-style salad\". This is their variant of the Yu Sheng according to the menu, which is usually eaten during the Chinese New Year period, served with crunchy crackers and boiled prawns. Greens were refreshingly crunchy, while the prawns were fresh and the crunchy crackers gave a savoury crunch to the dish, but the Yu Sheng part could be really felt from the dressing used which is almost identical to the plum sauce and sesame oil combination though way lighter and less sweet but still subtly uplifting. A pretty unique item for a zichar stall.
One of the few menu items brought over to the Pandan Gardens outlet that is also available at Alexandra. These were as good as the original outlet; creamy yet savoury enough spiked with chili padi and a hint of curry flavour from the curry leaves. The sauce completely covers up the fried prawns, which has a crisp and light batter and are plump and fresh.

It comes with some seafood like sliced fish and squid and of course, the two raw eggs cracked on top (one for the smaller portion)! Mix them up and enjoy! üòã

A dish that I always order whenever I visit the place.\n<br />.
The food was very tasty (plus the veggies not in pic) and even better when enjoyed with family and friends :\')
Who would expect a zichar place selling this Chinese take of the Western burger!\n<br />.

Unlike many places that just tossed it with the sauce, the pasta here actually went under the wok to infuse the sauce and aroma of wok hei.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #zichar #pasta #saltedeggyolk

Then perhaps you could look to an affordable meal at #kekpandan gardens for the best solution - The¬†{Moonlight Hor Fun}¬†($6) validates your sole reason to visit the new joint. Crowned with a raw egg which to my dismay suffered a cruel fate before greeting the table. Though the wok hei is slightly poorer in this version as compared to the Alexandra outlet and the ingredients seemingly less abundant. Still, you won\'t hear any complaints as this dish is passed around
Who agrees that KEK Pandan does a much better rendition of this dish than Alexandra?
Also reminscing the salted egg yolk prawns (deshelled) with a liquid gold pool of thickend chalky sauce gathered at its feet. Perfect for tainting that insanely pure white steamed Mantou in
Though the wok hei is slightly poorer in this version as compared to the Alexandra outlet, there was none heard but sighs of approval around the table as they dug in
pasta imbued with a bit of smoke from the wok hei and it\'s strands coated evenly in \'made-from-scratch\' salted yolk sauce. The winning factor, the two huge slabs of large soft shells crab deep fried till golden and crispy brown, swuirting out hot juices when bit into
Tonight\'s dinner situation at KEK Pandan Gardens with the man of my life and ma familia \n<br />Love that they kept the signature {ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥Á≤â} and {Coffee Pork Ribs} on the menu over here whilst you can also get a bit of the contemporary zi-char concept. Salted egg yolk soft shell crab spaghetti, anybody?

üëçüèª something different from the usual Tze char
Instead of just pasta and sauce, the spaghetti is wok fried before serving for additional texture bite and wok hei. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #pasta #spaghetti #prawnpaste #harcheongkai #zichar #hawker #hawkerfood
This is a much improved version with the grainy salted egg yolk sauce coating on the pasta. What makes it different here is that the pasta is given a toss in the wok fried before serving for a hint of crisp bite texture and wok hei.
