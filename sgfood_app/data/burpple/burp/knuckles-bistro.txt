Not a perfect place to get pictures of your food, but your perfect place to satisfy your tastebuds with a myriad of western food ranging from pastas, truffle fries to pork knuckles here! $8 just for this plate of pasta! Beers are really cheap here too!
Yes you heard me right! Yummy truffle infused fries for just $6! And a really generous serving too! 
Sirloin Steak for $12 is too good to be true? Then probably you have not heard of Knuckles Bistro; this industrial-themed western bistro at Kovan owned by Nakhon Kitchen serves uncommonly served western grub at really affordable rates. Their signature item would be the Pork Knuckles; at a price of $10 with quality that makes it value-for-money. Fancy a drink? They do serve several types of alcohol so you can enjoy a pint or two along with Pork Knuckles in true German fashion. A great alternative to the crazy queues at Nakhon Kitchen, especially since the queue at Knuckles had always been comparatively shorter.
The more appropriate name for this dish would have been \"Sautéed Mushrooms\", but there was really nothing to fault for these except that they were a wee bit oily. Apart from that, the earthy flavour was well brought out, and the leafy greens were pretty refreshing too.
Grilled Chicken Chop may sound like a kopitiam western stall dish, but it also probably is the best gauge of the chef\'s skills when it comes to the grill. They pulled it off well for this one; juicy, tender chicken which I could cut with a spoon smothered in a thick brown sauce which suggested hints of shallots. The fries also had a hint of truffle; possibly unintended and likely to have come from the previous batch of Truffle Fries orders (all the better for me though). Even the garden salad is worth a mention; the leaves are so fresh-looking and made most garden salads that came as a side in other restaurants look sad and dead.
Good knuckles are hard to find, let alone affordable ones that are situated at heartlands. Glad to have survived the wait for the ones served at Knuckles; at $10 this is definitely value-for-money. Already de-boned when served, there is no need for a mess before you dig straight in for the tender meat and crispy roast pork-like skin. The sour vegetables on the side makes for a good cleanse as it takes off quite a bit of the dish\'s oiliness, and the mash potatoes were smooth, buttery and savoury especially with the brown sauce.
Fries were crispy, yummy and most importantly, affordable! Knuckles Bistro serves this big portion at only $5! 
$5!
$8. Not the best but still decent and probably the cheapest around. 
New favourite!
Affordable and decent food, only $8 for mains! 
Super cheap and decent pork knuckle! Personally think this is better than brotzeit\'s one as it came with mashed potato and the gravy. Makes it less dry. This place serves great and cheap truffle fries too! Ordered 2 servings each plus a crispy wings (6pcs) and bill only amounted to $31! 😱😱
Post Oktoberfest craving for some pork knuckle? Knuckles is perfect place for you! $$:at a only $8 for a decent portion to satisfy your tastebud, add on a blanc for $8 to make your dinner complete! 
Served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes

thou i am a bit wary of the slight redness in the meat ... juicy but like medium close to well done ... #iamnotusedtoit #knuckles #burrple #burpplesg #nofilter #tender #juicy #butiscared
but somehow after a while the fries turned soggy and there was not much truffle taste left ... #burrple #burpplesg #knuckles #nofilter #trufflefries

Was hunting for a place for lunch (alone), so I decided to try this bistro that I have been eyeing for sometime. The portion of Crispy Pork Knuckles is pretty decent for $10, the meat is succulent despite it being rather lean (much much healthier) and the skin is oh-so-crispy. Even the charred part of the meat is soft and chewable with a nice caramelized flavour. I do like having each bite of meat together with the tangy Sauerkraut. I am pleasantly surprise that the pickled cabbage still retained the natural sweetness of the vegetable, which adds a refreshing flavour to the protein.  The mash potato was alright, reasonably smooth, but nothing really special. Definitely with ur visit as as a main course before heading to #hattersstreetcafe (which is just a few shops away) for dessert!#kovan #german #knuckles #porkknuckles #burpple #openricesg #nomnomsg #foodiemaxium
