One of the new desserts introduced in their latest menu revamp ‚Äî the Earl Grey Panna Cotta also comes with elements such as Strawberry Gel, Sponge Cake, Almond Crumb and Macerated Strawberries. The Panna Cotta comes pretty aromatic from the tea infusion; it comes with a distinct Earl Grey flavour that made it pretty appealing even on its own. The Vanilla Sponge Cake might feel a little stiff on my first bite, though having it with a bit of the Strawberry Gel does seem to do the trick and gives it another dimension of flavour as well. Crumbles and almond crumbs are added for some texture and gives the dessert a crunch, while the macerated strawberries were fresh sweet to the right degree without being overly so. Overall, a pretty light dessert that feels less adventurous than those from their previous menu, but still puts the meal to a good end as always.
Back to South Union Park for the launch of their new menu revamp ‚Äî the Pork &amp; Fennel Sausage Pasta is the only wholly new pasta on the menu. A very simple yet hearty and comforting affair, the Pork &amp; Fennel Sausage Pasta was something that hits the heart rather than being bold and adventurous like the filled pasta from previous menus. The pasta is handmade in-house as usual, done al-dente with a bit of bite while it comes in this light tomato-based chicken jus that is tangy and pretty appetizing without being overwhelming. The broccoli creates some texture for the pasta with a crunch, while the pork and fennel sausage provides a meaty bite without a porky stench. It\'s a good balance of lightness and richness in flavours ‚Äî very simple, fuss-free that is so ever satisfying to have.
Not exactly a new menu item, but one of the new items on their special boards for this weekend. The portion is pretty generous with three thick slabs of pork belly ‚Äî each comes with an adequate amount of fat as well as lean meat for a balance of tenderness and bite; charred for a bit of smokiness amidst the savoury flavour without carrying a porky stench. Beneath the slabs of pork belly lie nibs of corn, pine nuts and baked beans (which is all prepared in-house) for some texture, while everything sits atop a bed of parsnip pur√©e that\'s absolutely smooth with a hint of sweetness; very intriguing and certainly my favourite element in the entire dish.
Duck Confit Pasta ($22) - The tagliatelle pasta was freshly made and served in hazelnut cream with saut√©ed spinach. Felt the duck taste was quite overpowering, but the cream that went with the pasta was really good. \n<br />Honey Soy Fried Chicken ($12) - with pickled red onions. Crispy well seasoned boneless chicken paired with a honey drizzle.                                            Braised Chicken Leg ($23) - with potato pur√©e, carrot, button mushroom, haricot vert. This was one comfort food! The chicken was tender and tasted so good with the sauce that came with it.      South Union Park is a cafe that gives a relaxed vibe as it is located away from the city. Love the quiet environment and it is a cafe without any gst or service charge.
Great Earl grey panna cotta with an impeccable texture that goes rather well with the strawberries. Portion isnt small but it really is very light such that one pax can finish this without any trouble at all. Would have been a great dessert if all of these wasn\'t marred by the fluffy looking but rubbery sponge. Checking out xing Wei chua\'s post seems like this wasn\'t a one off thing so I\'m just wondering why????? They have such great fluffy sponges for the pineapple coconut sundae why did they do this to the Earl grey panna cotta? The leathery sponge really spoilt the dish I\'m sure they don\'t have an issue with the execution it could be a new texture they\'re playing with
Irks me when great places don\'t have a proper website and menu easily available.
Sounds simple and it really is, but executed to perfection and it\'s a delight. The roasted pineapple doesn\'t have an edge, and combines so well with the coconut ice cream. Throw in soft sponge cake and butter cookies and you\'ve got a fruity dessert great for sharing

The salmon was about as tender as it could get since it was fully cooked thru but only very slightly pink. Kudos to them for the temperature control. It was so tender my friend was worried it was raw haha. Anyway the white clam cream was the epitome of \"light and flavourful\" and was raving about how it elevated the tender salmon. Definitely a salmon dish thats rather unique
Chicken was very slightly dry but otherwise a hearty dish. The sauce was roasty and satisfying and I particularly loved the mushrooms which were of the perfect texture
The duck was soooooo tender I would have mistaken it for chicken if not for the flavour. Personally I don\'t think the toppings do that much for the dish but the sauce had a great tang that keeps you going back for more. While we ordered the plate to share, it took herculean willpower to stop &gt;
Delightful piece of heaven. A well-crusted steak, garnished with chimichurri sauce, laid on a bed of sweet potatoe mash cooked to near perfection. 
Absolutely loved this signature dish. This is the first roasted Vegetables dish that I could say, that a plate is just not enough! \n<br />The choice of mix - Asian + Western plus the dressing used is brilliantly put together! Cauliflower, Broccoli, Sweet Potatoes, Corn Nibblets and Quinoa in Soy Sauce and Sesame Oil.\n<br />Delicious and simply understated!
Well seasoned with vinaigrette, the salad with a generous portion of cherry red and green tomatoes tasted refreshing.\n<br />The squid was perfectly cooked. It\'s tender and easily digestible.\n<br />Overall a great dish as an appetizer, getting your palate ready for the main course.
Ahhh, reunited with my love. Generous, tender and juicy, this steak from South Union Park is my bae. üòç
The risotto is cooked al dente thus giving it a nice bite. Squid, prawns and clams were cooked perfect. The best thing about this dish is that it does not have that fishy taste that I\'ve experienced while having other versions of squid ink risotto/pasta. You\'ll get a nice citrus hit of lemon zest which does indeed elevate this dish. Oh don\'t forget their desserts as well! Amazing food, great service, awesome company. Definitely coming back for more. #burpple
What\'s not to love about runny yolks and a crunchy sausage crust? @southunionpark did this decently. And I enjoyed the honey crispy chicken too. Skip the bland and dry burger though.
Golden brown french toast served with honeyed bacon, caramelized apples, and drenched in organic maple syrup. It\'s just pure indulgence!
It really took me a long while to give this a try ‚Äî finally had it because this comes as a weekend special that comes in limited servings. This certainly did not disappoint in true South Union Park style ‚Äî the Flank Steak is pretty lean while chewy but absolutely tender with a smoky crust while it sits atop a sweet potato mash that provides a flavour contrast against the meat. The olive oil manages to smoothen the sweet potato mash a bit for a more luscious feel, binds it well with both sweet potato and the beef to cut the sweetness and meatiness of the dish to ensure everything rounds of nicely. Another new found favourite at the favourite place for well-executed, delicious, fare made with the heart and from scratch.
Again, another one of the signature dishes that I had never got around to trying out until today ‚Äî got these because my friend was really keen on trying it too. No regrets getting these morsels of crisp, fried chicken that is juicy on the inside and coated with just the right amount of honey soy for ample flavour ‚Äî the right balance of sweetness and savory notes that makes this a simple yet satisfying treat that ticked all the right boxes. We actually ended up almost finishing the entire portion even before our mains came, and that\'s after we are trying to pace ourselves out in order to save some stomach space for the mains as they arrive.
A really innovative twist on the ubiquitous French dish, it featured surprisingly tender, juicy duck pieces atop Tagliatelle tossed in a hazelnut cream sauce. Loved the bits of hazelnut in it which added a crunchy texture, as well as the sprinkle of Parmesan saut√©ed spinach which completed the dish. #burpple
Indeed, the food impressed and we enjoyed every dish! Would recommend the Duck Confit Tagliatelle ($22), Squid Ink Risotto ($26) and Herb Crusted Barramundi ($24). #burpple
Custardy soft lemon tart, for lemon tart lovers, balanced flavor between sour, sweet &amp; tardy ($7)
Soft tender slices of duck meat with al-dente pasta, its so good!
One bite into this thin and crisp flatbread and I was sold! üòã Topped with generous smear of brie cheese, the slices of bacon were tender, juicy with a pleasant savory and smoky flavour whereas the roasted mushrooms were well saut√©ed, chewy with a subtle earthy note. Along with the crunch of leek onion slices and the crisp, cracker-like flatbread crust (that resembled a thin crust pizza), this was a dish that\'s  totally worth the indulgence (and getting my lazy body out of bed early for on a weekend)! I would personally  recommend this for sharing as a side though, instead of having it as a main on your own .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
A striking resemblance to macdonald\'s big breakfast that\'s upgraded and modified with fried potatoes (instead of hash browns) and fruit jam (instead of butter and maple syrup). Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this assorted breakfast platter with its fluffy scrambled eggs that\'s done to perfection, fried potatoes (essentially irregular shaped tater tots) that executed an ideal crisp exterior, a tender, meaty, juicy and flavorful sausage patty. Lastly, not forgetting the soft and pillowy English muffins that comes with a side of tangy, berry sweet fruit jam. Despite the mediocre elements that constitute this meal, each of them was a significant contribution to the flavours, mouthfeel and of course, enjoyment! üòã\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
We heard that @southunionpark has their brunch menu up üòå time for a re-visit!
Slice through the buttery and crumbly outer layer of the fondant to unleash the slow, oozy outpouring of liquid, gold-hued passionfruit within. The frozen yoghurt sitting on top keeps things refreshing, whilst the pool of carrot ginger puree is refreshingly sweet and zingy in its hawker centre fruit juice stall-esque likeness.
Punters who enjoy patronising hip, branded burger joints and don\'t mind parting with up to $25 of their hard-earned cash for oft middling burgers(sometimes even sans the fries) with a side of cool, would do well to avoid the honest-to-goodness wholesomeness of South Union Park\'s bloody delicious take on meat between buns.
I\'d steak my life on it that you\'ll enjoy this. Medium rare goodness on a bed of sweet potato mash, topped with a bright chimichurri sauce.
Still individually discernable grains of rice bound by a robust, inky seafood stock, coalesced as a whole into a midnight-tinted mound of luxuriant creaminess that\'s further enriched with a liberal dousing of EVOO. Top it off with plump, tender clams, slices of tiger prawn, octopus along with pickled fennel shavings and what you have is a delicious risotto that\'s not punishing you with heavy-handed richness. Silkily seductive, as I imagine @veronicaphua would say.
You gno you want this gnocchi ‚Äì plush pillows with a perfect char swathed in roasted butternut, broccoli stem, mushrooms, creamy, cheesy pesto ricotta and a liberal sprinkling of herbed crust. Gnochidding when I say this is one of the best gnocchi dishes I\'ve had in recent memory.
On South Union Park\'s specials board last weekend was the chicken pate. If you happen to spot it, I urge you to order it without hesitation.
It\'s amazing how much flavour can be coaxed out of vegetables given the right treatment. I couldn\'t stop picking at the wonderfully sweet and crunchy broccoli, cauliflower and carrot pieces. The Asian vinaigrette over the quinoa salad was the perfect balance of tart and sweet as well, enhancing without overpowering the main components.
There I said it.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />To make risotto properly is not difficult, but the most important ingredient is patience -- few restaurants are going to devote a precious burner and 25 minutes of a chef\'s time to a single dish. Also, If the risotto comes with large amounts of seafood, it is almost guaranteed to be overcooked.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />BUT. The food at south union park took so long to come that I‚Äôm quite certain that this was the culprit. The squid ink risotto ($26) came topped with clams, shrimp and octopus and it was actually really really good. And although the seafood was a tad overdone, the brininess and sweetness of the entire dish totally made up for it. The blackened risotto itself was slightly chewy which was perfect in my book.
‚Ä¢\n<br />Finally managed to pay a visit to south union park! This came highly recommended and it didn\'t disappoint. Homemade al-dente pasta, saut√©ed spinach, duck and hazelnut cream was a winning combo.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />I\'d recommend this for sharing as the cream can get a bit rich after a while but it\'s really super flavorful and definitely was a crowd favorite.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The adage that good things comes to those who wait rang true as the only issue I had with south union park is that we had to wait foreverrrr for our food. üò©üò©
|\n<br />I had never been a fan of big breakfast. However @southunionpark had changed my mind. In house made muffin, cranberry sauce and harsh brown! This set the golden standard for all big breakfast in Town! .\n<br />|\n<br />Please go try it!!!!
|\n<br />In house made toast coated with egg and pan fried till light golden. Contrast of sweet and savory between the maple syrup and bacon. Lovely and tasted like Christmas.
|\n<br />Semi cured salmon laid on a layer of egg dill mayo and pickled cucumber. Really well balanced dish. Every bite hit the right note of the palate which created the prefect melody.
|\n<br />Morning pizza. Super comfort food with earthy mushroom, savory bacon and sweet onion. Great for sharing. Not advisable to finish alone.
Super awesome food sold here. The beef rice bowl was flavorful with tender beef slices. The salmon rice bowl has generous slices of melt-in-your-mouth salmon (usually I don\'t like cooked fish because I don\'t like the \"fish taste\" but this doesn\'t have at all) and small seaweed bits in their rice which gives it a nice chewy texture. Honey chicken and crab cakes are also a must-try.
So if you have not made any plans for this coming weekend, why not pop by @southunionpark and try their breakfast menu! I did and pretty early too.
For those with a sweet tooth, the French Toast might be your choice of breakfast at South Union Park. It\'s topped with caramelized apples and some crispy bacon for a contrast in flavors and texture. Do keep an eye on the organic maple syrup - we might have been too greedy with it and that caused our bread to be a little too soggy!
South Union Park prides itself in making most of its ingredients from scratch, and we could easily tell when we tried the dishes.
Knowing that customers might not want to have raw sashimi during the first meal of the day, Chef Terence lightly cured the chunks of salmon to give it a subtle flavor so that we can still taste its freshness (definitely not those overly salty ones). Of course, the bread is freshly baked in-house as South Union Park strives to make most of the ingredients from scratch.
Who wouldn\'t love to wake up to this? Fluffy scrambled eggs, juicy hamburg patties, a chewy muffin bun and potato fritters that are to-die-for! Best thing is that EVERYTHING on this plate is made in-house! üòÜ
Breakfast has never been this sexy. South Union Park\'s new breakfast menu is out and might just be your new reason to get up on the weekends! üòõ
Trying the slightly pricier south union park. Had the salmon and the gnocchi. Welcomed the broccoli and the squash addition to the gnocchi, but preferred the older iteration of the salmon! With the price increase, and the main portions not as filling, definitely a place to come less often and just a treat once in a while. Had the lemon tart ($6) as well and that was great. Still a great place for a solid meal!
Luscious, zingy lemon custard on a crunchy base is the kind of dessert I\'ll never tire of. The caramelised surface of this one at @southunionpark added a fragrant, sweet crisp that made their version extra delightful. Only $6 nett for a large slice? Take my money already.
Available on weekends between 9am and 12noon as part of the new breakfast menu is this Tarte Flamb√© . This Alsatian-Mosellan and South German item (thank you google!) is similar to a pizza, but is more refined and lighter.\n<br />The base is a thin, flaky crust which has an addictive crisp bite. Spread over it is an appetising sweet and savoury mix of cooked leek onions, roasted mushrooms, bacon and cheese.\n<br />I think this is ideal for sharing as it comes sliced into 6 easy-to-eat squares. So if you are coming in a group, I suggest ordering a main dish each and getting this to split.
If you\'ve found certain commercial brands of cured salmon too salty or strong tasting, you should try the cured salmon, or \"gravlax\" as it is called at @southunionpark. Its flavour profile is milder in comparison which I find really palatable. Also, Chef Terence and his team have used it to create one of the prettiest open-faced cold sandwiches I\'ve seen in a while.\n<br />On a thick slice of brioche is a freaking neat pile of finely-chopped egg dill mayo, and arranged on top of that are the cubes of cured fish with a few slices of housemade pickled cucumbers and red onions for extra punch.\n<br />By the way, this visually arresting sandwich is only available for breakfast on weekends between 9am and 12noon. So in less than 9 hours from now, you can actually order one if you like üòä.
The Cajun Chicken Bowl, available between 11.30am and 2pm on Fridays at South Union Park, has won me over with its delectable protein and carb combo.\n<br />The team here always takes things up several notches (they make nearly everything from scratch!), so I knew even the rice would be special. And yup, this one here was cooked with garlic butter and small pieces of pineapple, and topped by a salsa of corn and red peppers. I am not exaggerating when I say it tasted as good as it looked.\n<br />From chatting with Chef-owner Terence, I also learned that the chicken breast in this goes through a two-step cooking process in order to achieve that hard-to-find level of moistness, tenderness and flavour. Portion size was really generous as well, which made me regret wearing such a tight dress today üòÇ\n<br />If you plan on visiting South Union Park, do note the change in their opening hours. Best to check their Facebook page for details.
Love the depth and complexity from spices in their signature cold brew Hibiscus tea. I could taste clove and cinnamon (in optimal amounts so they didn\'t overwhelm), which made this refreshing drink infinitely more interesting than a regular iced tea.
What a good change from our usual truffle fries. üòç but I\'m still a truffle fries person. üòÖ
A stunning Squid Ink Risotto ($26) from South Union Park, this dark hued dish was comfort on a plate. With clams, tiger prawns, octopus, pickled fennel in the mix; the sweetness and freshness from the crustaceans simply enhanced the robustness of the squid ink. Such creamy richness married with the lighter flavours of the seafood and spices, melding harmoniously. The complexity of the textures such as the chewy-tender tentacles and meaty bite-sized tiger prawn chunks also added to the appeal. And though I have had squid ink dishes less than a handful of times, this was definitely one of the best as it was able to showcase the pleasant subtle savouriness of squid ink and that it is a flavouring element as much as it is a food colouring.
South Union Park starts their weekend breakfast service today ‚Äî found myself waking up early on a Saturday morning pretty excited to head down for a sumptuous breakfast. The Baked Eggs are a simple treat but also really comforting; it differs from the Shashouka for the lack of spices, but it\'s served just the way baked eggs should be. Using ingredients such as Roasted Pepper, Tomato and house-made Chorizo, the baked eggs come tangy with savoury chunks of chorizo to chew on as well as runny yolk ‚Äî topping it up above the house-made grilled country bread which is light, fluffy and comes with a hint of char, it\'s the recipe that promises a satisfying breakfast treat.
If you\'re looking for homely food made with passion, you might just find it here - from homemade pastas to sausages.
Served piping hot with cubes of al-dente potatoes, you\'ll also want to make sure that with every spoonful, you get some of those miniature crisp garlic croutons with the sweet-savoury corn chowder for an extra burst of flavour.\n<br />9bucks/serve
All good Burgers, must have cheese. Judging you if you say they don\'t üòè\n<br />The resident Cheeseburger at South Union Park has all the right things in all the right places. Butter seated housemade fluffy burger buns sandwiching a thick super juicy, well seasoned rosemary-thyme beef patty, aged cheddar, mayo and caramelized onions deglazed with a raspberry vinegar for a burst of sweetness and tang. The kinda burger that gets you approval with a single moan the moment you\'ve devoured your first chunk off its mothership.\n<br />Resistance, is futile.\n<br />--\n<br />In line with #burppleburgermonth, review your favourite burger spots in the hood, tag 9 friends and stand a chance to win a burger party for all ten of you at one of my favourite Burger Houses, Three Buns @burgersandheads!

Hats off to small establishments that don\'t conform to microwaving processed food and choosing to make your meals from scratch. \n<br />My love for citrus fruits are rampant, even more so when they still carry that zesty zing when made into a pastry product.
One of the recent additions to South Union Park\'s menu after their menu revamp ‚Äî also one of the items that really got my attention especially with the use of roasted butternut and broccoli stem; things I might possibly eat everyday if I ever convert to be a vegetarian (which is never üòõüòõ).
Short Rib Cavatelli in Tomato Ragu ($24)\n<br />LOVED THIS! The beef was tender &amp; delightful, the ragu was hearty &amp; comforting. Cavatelli is not everyone\'s cup of tea- it may seem strange to people who are used to the more common pasta forms. But am quite the carb-lover, so I loved it. It does not look like much, but it will fill you up because it is quite dense. #carbsftw
Duck Confit Tagliatelle with Saut√©ed Spinach, Hazelnut Cream ($22)\n<br />Pasta was done perfectly, same goes for the duck. The Hazelnut Cream is quite heavy (might feel jelat), but one thing for sure is that this was way too salty for my liking. Really such mixed feelings cos I loved everything about it except the sauce.
The ever changing menu of South Union Park kinda forcefully left me with the choice of this interesting looking dessert. It\'s basically carrot cake with molten lava white chocolate with a big scoop of yogurt at the top with carrot sauce sandwiched in between the carrot cake. It\'s taste pretty alright except for the sourish yogurt which I failed to appreciate. I found the sourness overwhelmed the white chocolate and even the carrot cake. When I tried the dessert without the yogurt it tasted much better. Perhaps South Union Park was trying a bit too hard on this one, they should have stuck to something simpler.
If you\'re in the mood for pasta, this is definitely one of the dishes to order here!
The salmon was delightfully done and I enjoyed how well it went with the leek pur√©e. The roasted cauliflower gave another dimension of texture to this easy going dish. Well done!
Finally visiting a super trending cafe @southunionpark for once üòÇ (im usually late in the game haha). Overall food is really good. Familar ingredients with a unique twist.

This place is a bit hard to access without a car, but this dish was worth the travel! Great way to kick off our mealüéâ‚úåüèª
Roasted Pineapple and Coconut Parfait ($11)
Mushroom Ravioli ($20)
Kurobuta Pork Cheek ($26)
Lamb Shank Cavatelli ($22)
Lightly Smoked Salmon ($23)
Not one to rest on their laurels, following up from their several successful dessert launches comes this Banana Chocolate Parfait ($8), a bowl that is constructed with chocolate and banana cakes, chocolate mousse and candied walnuts. The unique thing in this (and I am purely guessing) is the lime zest shavings that provides a different flavour profile to cut through the heaviness from the strong flavours coming from the bananas and chocolate.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />South Union Park\n<br />Address: 101, Jalan Kembangan, Singapore 419139\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #southunionpark #southunionparksg
I had no idea South Union Park makes every part of their burger in-house, yes, even the buns! This was something I learned over a conversation I had with Chef Terence after the dinner crowd had cleared last Sunday. He shared with us the great lengths he and his team had gone through to in order to create their ideal cheeseburger. There were even photos on his phone showing how they did side-by-side comparisons of different formulations for their beef patty.\n<br />Well, I really appreciated all the effort they put in because their cheeseburger was one of the more memorable ones I\'ve eaten.\n<br />As big as the Whopper from Burger King, there is nothing superfluous about it, just basics done very well.\n<br />So there I was, sinking my teeth into light, pillowy buns that\'d been toasted and buttered, and a really juicy, thick beef patty. To be honest, I\'ve always been quite picky about the texture of patties but theirs suited me well - the ground meat wasn\'t bound too tightly or loose. The only other additions in the burger were melted aged cheddar and raspberry vinegar-cooked onions. Loved how the latter brought a subtle acidity that helped to cut the richness. Ditto the lightly-dressed lettuce served on the side.
This comes with cauliflower leek pur√©e, roasted cauliflower and edamame.
If the Kurobuta Pork Cheek is the dish that defines the character of South Union Park\'s menu revision, the Passionfruit Carrot Fondant would be the dessert of the same calibre. It\'s an utterly inventive and creative approach of tearing down the familiar Carrot Cake and repackaging  the soul of it in a different form. The cake comes with passionfruit white chocolate ganache within, while topped with Froyo (that itself was a textural galore ‚Äî thick, dense but still able to melt; its hard to describe in words) and candied ginger and sitting atop a pool of carrot puree. It\'s interesting how everything works here ‚Äî the spices flavours in the cake and candied ginger, crunchy sunflower seeds, the carrot puree and the zingy passionfruit-infused white chocolate cake; it\'s something familiar in flavour but not quite the usual that is still very well-executed. One of those desserts that works in terms of flavour and texture, but also fun to have especially with a group of friends as well!
When asked which of the new desserts he is most proud of, Chef @terence_chuah replied, \"the Passionfruit Carrot Fondant\". He shared that he had spent a lot of time and effort in its creation.\n<br />I\'d liken this to the lovechild of carrot cake and gingerbread as it brings qualities of both together. Moist in texture, the fondant contains a hint of cinnamon. Cut into it and a centre of sumptuous white chocolate and passionfruit ganache is revealed.\n<br />The fondant is presented in a pool of carrot ginger pur√©e and crowned with frozen yoghurt and ginger-candied carrot - elements that not only enhance the aesthetics but also the taste.\n<br />And for some reason, maybe it\'s because of the colours, this dessert inspired me to think of autumn when I was eating it.
One of the more unassuming dishes in their latest (and very adventurous) menu, this dessert came together perfectly to create a party in my mouth. üòú
Of the new plated desserts, this is the lightest, although to be honest, it is still rather substantial because Chef Terence believes in feeding his customers well. \n<br />The rich sweetness of the roasted pineapples was tamed by a coating of the zesty kaffir lime gel. Having it with the light coconut parfait did the trick as well.\n<br />I love the crunchiness from the fragrant French butter almond cookie and cranberry oat granola, both made in-house. In fact, the latter is so scrumptious I\'d love to see it become a standalone brunch item one day - hint hint üòú\n<br />Thick and gooey, the butterscotch sauce is the fabulous \"glue\" that pulls everything in the plate together.  \n<br />In short, this is well worth saving tummy space for.
Slightly modified from their previous menu, this salmon dish definitely still delights! üòú
Cauliflower Leek Pur√©e, Roasted Cauliflower and Edamame. Yet another one of South Union Park\'s dishes from the revised menu. Salmon dishes are often predictable, and while this lies on the safer side of the scale when compared to the likes of the Kurobuta Pork Cheek, this is also yet another wonderfully well-executed dish coming out from their kitchen that sets itself apart from other salmon dishes elsewhere. So succulent, flaky and smooth, the salmon was simple delightful and melts-in-the-mouth. It is also really generously portioned and just so flavourful by itself as well. Coming with a smooth cauliflower leek puree that acts like mash and roasted cauliflower that\'s one of my weaknesses (oh, that smoky, slightly salty touch that grilled vegetables carry!), it\'s simply one of those dishes I would go for if I am craving for something light and less meaty!
Beautifully moist and melt-in-the-mouth tender, this is easily one of the best smoked salmons I\'ve had. And for the price of $23 nett, the slab of fish is very generous in size. \n<br />If you like cauliflower like I do, you\'ll rejoice over the vegetable appearing in roasted form as well as in a pur√©e together with leek.
One look and it may seem like a beef cheek dish, but it is the Kurobuta Pork Cheek from South Union Park\'s revised menu. Served with coconut polenta and garlic sprouts, the Kurobuta Pork Cheek is also glazed with tamarind here for a citrusy flavour to cut through the meatiness. It attempts to bring in a bit of Peranakan elements from the garlic sprouts on the top, while the coconut polenta was simply legendary ‚Äî very fragrant like a mash/pur√©e of Nasi Lemak that fits very well with the chunky meat that delivers a bite. If there is one dish that I would have to choose to define the character of South Union Park\'s revised menu, this would be that dish!
Everyone marveled at this when it was placed on the table, but it didn\'t end there as the first mouth was equally astounding! ‚ú®
After taking a well-deserved break, Chef Terence and his team at South Union Park are back to tickle our tastebuds. And having just had lunch there today, let me assure you they\'re going from strength to strength.\n<br />This was no ordinary Kurobuta Pork Cheek. The tamarind (\"assam\") glaze lifted the richness of the tender meat with a fruity tang. As satisfying as it was, what we all found most astounding was the Coconut Polenta. Ultra smooth and light, it tasted remarkably like nasi lemak that\'s been pur√©ed! I also don\'t recall having seen garlic sprouts appear in restaurant dishes but it proved a good complement with its smoky, crunchy succulence.\n<br />Highly original, this is a must-try if you like pork (which in this case, somehow manages to taste a lot like beef)
Yet another pasta dish that I just love at South Union Park ‚Äî newly introduced in their latest menu, this dish features mushroom ravioli in Basil Pesto sauce. Each morsel carries the handmade quality that South Union Park\'s pasta are known for and done al-dente ‚Äî comes packed with mushrooms and has a nice chew to it texturally. The pesto sauce adds a nice hint of flavour, while panko is added over the top for a little crunch with sundried cherry tomatoes giving a burst of tanginess. Yet another brilliantly executed pasta dish that I would totally order again here!
Vegetarians, this is a new pasta at South Union Park you should check out.\n<br />Each handmade ravioli is stuffed with mushroom and cooked al dente. I am partial to pesto and theirs, made from scratch with basil, is delicious. Pops of sweet juiciness come courtesy of a few oven-dried tomatoes. And as the finishing touch, Chef Terence throws on some light panko-like bits for a little crunch.\n<br />Come to think of it, non-vegetarians might want to give this a try too.
I would have this Grilled Mackerel Rice Bowl very often if I could. Why? Well, for a start, the rice is deliciously seasoned. Secondly, the toppings are plentiful. There\'re three large pieces of grilled boneless mackerel (they taste like the type you get at Korean places) coated with a slightly sweet sauce, heaps of pickled carrot and soy beansprouts plus one perfect onsen egg.\n<br />Truth be told, this isn\'t a bowl of fancy stuff but because everything\'s made in-house and was executed with such finesse, the taste went way beyond the ordinary.
Scotch Eggs have never been something that excites me because generally, the minced meat tends to be rather one-dimensional in taste.\n<br />Then THIS came along: sensuously runny-yolked, dolled up in exotic lemongrass and heaving with flair. I mean, even the Thai chili sauce is made from scratch for goodness sake. Talk about cooking with passion!\n<br />A great flavour bomb of a starter for sure.
This salad at South Union Park has a nice Asian twist to it. In terms of flavour, there are no sharp edges; only a refined, balanced medley that comes from the rather crispy pieces of duck meat being tossed with a carrot and radish slaw, and peanuts, in a light plum vinaigrette.\n<br />I recommend sharing this as a starter if you\'re with a couple of friends. It\'s suitable as a main course on its own too if you want something light.
South Union Park is back from their break, and along with it comes with the introduction of their new menu. Starting with the Scotch Eggs ‚Äî the sausage filling was flavourful as it carried a light hint of savouriness while the egg yolks came runny; all encased in a crisp, golden brown crust. Goes pretty well with the slaw and the Thai Chili dip on the side; the latter being all balanced without carrying an aftertaste nor being too sweet and just like almost every other thing from them, is made in-house.
.\n<br />Italian potato \"dumplings\" paired with roasted corn, mushrooms topped with loads of parmesan.\n<br />.\n<br />Not a pasta dish which I come across often, but I enjoyed nibbling the glazed gnocchi which somewhat resembled the texture of an eggplant. üçÜ\n<br />.\n<br />By the way, last weekend to satisfy your pasta cravings before the team @southunionpark goes on a short break. But not to worry, they will be back on 21st March before you know it.
heard so much about this restaurant and the flank steak (that is only served from Friday til Sunday, by the way) that i had to trudge through a Friday downpour and wet shoes to try this. and indeed it lived up to the hype. the flank steak ($28) was lean as it should be (no one ever calls a flank fat) and full of beefy goodness. there was a slight char, always a bonus, and it was nicely pink on the inside. difficult to fault the sweet potato mash, smooth without lumps and very more-ish. plus WHO DOESN\'T LIKE CARBS?????
Tight on cash but bent on impressing your date? Head to this cosy restaurant near Kembangan MRT for quality Western fare at very affordable prices. In general, the pastas are more competitively priced than their meat mains yet equally tasty ‚Äî try the Duck Confit Tagliatelle ($16) or Gnocchi ($17) with roasted corn and corn puree. If you have a larger budget, go straight for the Flat Iron Steak ($28), a seasonal dish served only from Fridays to Sundays. While lean, the beef is incredibly tender, and comes topped with zingy chimichurri. For dessert, have the Popcorn Flan ($13) to share. It\'s like popcorn, but made so much better with trimmings like hazelnut brittle and caramel foam. \n<br />Avg Price: $50 per couple\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayson Yeo
Red Wine Poached Pear ($14)
Saw Veronica\'s post on this on Burpple, then seeing that they still had it when I popped by yesterday made my choice for dinner so easy! üëÜ
Flat Iron Steak ($28)
Salmon Confit ($20)
The Tagliatelle is one of those pastas that leaves you satisfied and guilt-free. The pasta is just right, neither too chewy nor too soft. It is perfectly portioned for one with a generous amount of duck confit shreds. The saut√©ed spinach still retains its flavour despite being doused in a wonderful thin buttery hazelnut cream.
This bowl of dessert may look like the cheapest at S$8.00 among the plated desserts, but it is packed with many distinctive yet harmonious flavours. Cubes of banana cake, chocolate mousse and banana lime stacked together and mixed with honey yoghurt foam, finally drizzled with lots of black and white crumbs and desiccated coconuts put together. I would say this is one that is easy for sharing and worth getting as an after-meal dessert.
|\n<br />My favorite dessert! After hours of simmering in red wine, the pear soften and absorbed the fruitiness from the red wine. Crusty biscuit crumble created the different in texture. Just the right sweetness for my taste bud.
|\n<br />Sweet till the core. Good contrast of texture and fully expressed the idea of a sweeeeeet corn. Try not to eat this alone as you might experience hype sugar rush. üòÇ
|\n<br />My favorite main in this place. Honey glazed chicken cutlet laid on a bed of mashed potato. Super hearty meal which could lift any tired soul.
|\n<br />If you have a sweet tooth and like to eat carb, this will be THE pasta for you. The popping sweet by the corn and meaty texture from the mushroom.
|\n<br />Duck confit pasta and topped with hazelnut and cream. Till day, it was still the heaviest pasta on the menu. Really tasty but best to share among two. If the chef could squeeze of a orange and orange zest, would cut down the heaviness.
|\n<br />Beef Ragu with \"worm like pasta\" üò±üò±üò±. The fatty beef rib submerged into the ragu sauce and clung onto the Gemelli. Easy to eat which make it best speed lunch order!
|\n<br />Four flavored packed meatballs. Tossed in any type of carbs, it will be a satisfying main course. But A light heavy to be a starter.
|\n<br />This plate of crazily delicious golden chicken \"nugget\" temporarily filled  our growling stomach as we patiently wait for our pasta. .\n<br />|\n<br />Best way to eat it was to place chicken, cake and cream all in one bite! The contrast of sweet and savory led us wanting more!
|\n<br />Looked so simple but tasted so comforting. Duck gravy and stringy cheese. With a bottle of chilled beer, I could sit there all day long.
|\n<br />Today would be a a day of South Union Park review. A lovely place hidden at the Kembangan Area. .\n<br />|\n<br />Refreshing salad with tender octopus. I loved the idea that they added fried Sakura ebi to multiply the seafood-y taste.
Candied Walnuts, Banana Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Banana Lime. Again another dessert that gives the stellar meal at South Union Park a great ending. First spoon into the dessert and one gets impressed with how the smooth, creamy banana ice-cream is so fragrant yet of an apt level of sweetness that is barely near tipping the scale of being overly sweet ‚Äî so pronounced yet refined while the chunks of banana cake and chocolate cake alternates between decadently rich chocolate and light, fluffy banana cake without being cloyingly sweet or sore throat inducing. In between, the candied walnuts give it the dessert a sweet crunch of a good balance while the yogurt helps to mediate the various elements, helping to bring the smooth chocolate mousse that carries a bittersweet flavour into the entire dessert. So many textures, so many elements but all so prominent without ending up into a pool of mushiness ‚Äî it sounds simple but yet refined. Something to just head straight for especially it\'s the cheapest dessert available here at $8 nett!
Our table of 4 ordered multiple dishes and desserts to share and our favourite was definitely the gnocchi and the salmon! Everything tasted so clean but yet so so tasty. Yum, definitely want to go back to try everything else on the menu (and eat full portions of what we ordered) the desserts were pretty good too, tasted very sophisticated but didn\'t draw me back in like the food did. Will definitely be back!
Poutine because it\'s #fryday!\n<br />-\n<br />Poutine ($11) ‚Äì Crispy shoestring fries drenched in duck gravy, cheese sauce and topped with crispy duck bits. So addictive!\n<br />-\n<br />PS: Their crispy fried chicken with honey butter also #shiok! Hope that these two items will remain after their menu revamp.\n<br />-\n<br />#southunionpark #kembangan #poutine #ilovefries #friesday #friyay #tgif
Seemingly a dessert with some confused identity, because this lemon tart ditched the usual meringue topping with a touch of br√ªl√©e on the lemon custard. Despite the creative touch, the sourness of the lemon custard still stood out prominently.
An amazing dessert this is. Pudding with popcorn-infused foam on top, salted up to match the sweetness of caramel sauce below. Every spoonful for a sweet finish to a hearty meal.
It seems to me that the Red Wine Poached Pear (S$14.00) is quite a sophisticated affair. It takes a certain amount of knife-work on the pear to poach it evenly in the red wine. It also takes a deal of precision to place the poached pear on top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Most importantly, it takes some degree of mastery to be able to eat such an elegant piece of art without destroying it (which I did anyway).
Major meat lover here but I didn\'t have any regrets ordering the Gnocchi ($17). Sweet fragrance from the corn, garlic herb crumbs with soft gnocchi, caramelised a lovely brown.
Finally tried the dessert I had been most looking forward to try from South Union Park\'s revamped menu. It\'s pretty well-executed but the way it\'s done probably would attract a fair share of controversy over its flavour ‚Äî the red wine poached pear carried a light hint of red wine tartness that some may argue that it\'s not flavourful enough, though it also seems to enable the pear\'s flavour to shine through on its own leaving a cleaner finish. Flavours were well balanced off with a scoop of smooth, creamy and aromatic, vanilla bean speckled vanilla ice-cream hiding beneath the pear while the crumbles around the bottom gives it a buttery crunch. If anything, I would prefer the pear to be a little bit softer though I guess it\'s pretty hard for them to achieve that pedestal consistency given that the carved pear needs to sit nicely atop the vanilla ice-cream without appearing flaccid ‚Äî definitely a challenge right there.
-\n<br />I like cooked pears. They have this soft yet crisp crunch, yet retaining that slight coarse texture.\n<br />-\n<br />This in particular was succulent, dreamy and crisp. The tartness of the red wine, flirted coyly with the rich vanilla ice cream. The bed of crunch soaked up the sweetness of the wine reduction, ending the dish on a wine high.\n<br />-\n<br />I miss this already. Need to go back soon.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #southunionpark
Essentially what you get if hazelnut, caramel and utterly sinful buttery and salted popcorn had a glorious m√©nage a trois onbroad a bootyliciously wobbly pudding vessel. 4/5
just like the inevitability of salted popcorn sneaking into your cup of sweet popcorn. It is inevitable that you will fall for this dessert.
No delicate twirling happened here. Instead, we shlurpped up the whole plate like our lives depended on it!\n<br />Every al dente ribbon of the house-made pasta was coated with just the right amount of luscious hazelnut cream sauce. And because it\'s lifted by a precise spark of lemon juice, it never veered into \"jelak\" (a.k.a. rich in a turn-off way) territory. We\'re very happy with the plentiful pieces of tender duck and saut√©ed spinach too.\n<br />Highly recommended if you are after a meaty pasta.
When my parents and I were told of the dinner special (priced at $28 nett), we knew we had to get it. The Flat Iron Steak (also known as an Oyster Blade Steak) is a deeply flavourful and lean cut. In the very capable hands of Chef-owner Terence and his team, it turned out to be positively buttery in texture. My mum and I were suitably impressed but you should have heard my dad - he could not stop raving about it throughout our meal! üòÑ
I enjoyed the intense meaty flavors that went really well with the sweet and sour comfort of the tomatoes. The hollow cavatelli is designed perfectly to carry the pasta sauce. Finish this with one of their plated desserts choices like the popular popcorn flan.
Consistent great stuff by the @southunionpark team as usual üôåüèª 10bucks/Roasted Veg Salad\n<br />11bucks/Poutine\n<br />12bucks/Fried Chicken\n<br />18bucks/Mussels \n<br />#FTrecommends
Flans have a high tendency of leaning towards being a one-dimensional dessert, but this beyond impressive ensemble was anything but. The chef shared that he was inspired by the occasional salty popcorn surprise in a tub of caramel glazed popped kernels, and a spoonful delivered exactly that!
I was a little sad when I didn‚Äôt see the must-try Butternut Squash Agnolotti (top left) in the revamped menu, till the waitstaff informed me that I was fortunate enough to try the last few portions left! üéâ
Tried one of the recommended starters from the refreshed menu here and it sure didn\'t disappoint! \n<br />The thick squid rings and tentacles were cloaked in a layer of light, crisp batter, deep-fried long enough to give you that lovely bite while keeping the meat tender.üëåüèº I loved dipping the huge pieces into the accompanying remoulade with a tinge of tanginess from the Tabasco sauce in there! üëÖüí¶
Indecently moist, this salmon had me wide-eyed in wonder as it practically melted in my mouth. It had none of that strong fishy smell that puts some people off salmon either. The fish was laid on a bed of baby potatoes and spring vegetables that\'d been cooked in a light buttery sauce. In short, sublime upon sublime. 
This was an instant delight from the first mouthful, the foam instantly dissolves! Coating the creme base with a layer caramel üòã and biting into the hazelnut brittle for a change in texture. In efforts to create a cinema popcorn experience, some salt was added into the caramel sauce, to let you have the accidental effect of biting into a salty popcorn amidst the sweet ones.
The juicy red wine-poached pear confidently straddled the fence between succulent and crisp. Its subtle acidic note from the wine was smoothed out by the rich vanilla ice-cream. Elevating this plated dessert was the wine reduction and fresh-tasting crumble. What a way to end an already superb meal.
What an elegantly done chicken dish, and for only $20 nett! The thin, fat-free honey-glazed skin was a little crisp while the meat was fabulously moist through and through. Accompanying the chicken roulade was a nicely executed potato pur√©e and some brocollini.
I love it when unusual Asian ingredients make an appearance in a dish, and enhance it in subtle but intriguingly delicious ways.\n<br />That\'s why I found this Octopus Salad such a pleasure to eat. Joining the fresh mix of rocket leaves, Japanese cucumber, cherry tomatoes and grilled pieces of tender octopus were crunchy wing beans and Sakura ebi.\n<br />If you like a refreshing appetiser before you hit their mains, this is a good choice.
Comes with roasted corn and corn pur√©e, you can expect strong but not overpowering sweet flavours of corn that goes really well with garlic herb crumbs. All these were excellent companions to the best Gnocchi that I\'ve eaten - soft with a slight bite that wasn\'t extra chewy üòå
South Union Park has a new menu and their new offerings don\'t disappoint! üòõ
South Union Park\'s new menu drops this week ‚Äî felt the pain of seeing favorites like the Passionfruit Souffl√© and Butternut Agnolotti go the new menu is still very much on point and holds the standard they are known for (if not, even better). This Popcorn Flan sees a caramalised mousse above the flan with hazelnut shavings over the top in a puddle of salted caramel. The foam is all smooth and light ‚Äî quite mystical in a way where it\'s so light that it simply dissolves in your mouth with a subtle sweetness. The hazelnut brittles give it a good, sweet and salted crunch and the flan is eggy, smooth and custardy. A very well-balanced play of sweet-salty flavour profiles that is delightfully light to finish the meal with.
South Union Park has always impressed with their creations and we really like the new Gnocchi item on their new menu üìù. (But pleaaaaasse, bring back the butternut!üôè)
South Union Park never fails to surprise me on every visit, be it having items that I have already had or something new. The Chicken Roulade here has a particularly Christmas-sy feel to it ‚Äî special love given to the dish for the mash drenched in that honey-glazing that gives it a sweet-savoury flavour profile that is simply amazing. The chicken roulade is well-executed being succulent and tender with enough bite, stuffed with minimal amount of stuffings ‚Äî special mentioned to the crisp skin that\'s tasty; nailed down well on both texture and flavours. Highly recommended, especially if you are looking for a non-pasta dish here!
The dessert from South Union Park\'s Prix Fixe set-lunch menu (2 courses @ $18, 3 courses @ $21; both inclusive of coffee/tea). I love my desserts simple, and this nailed it with the classic banana cake served with a Salted Caramel Ice-Cream and Caramalised Bananas; both items seemingly what hits me right in the mind. The Banana Cake here is delightfully light, fluffy and served warmed so it\'s pillowy soft with a whiff of banana sweetness ‚Äî definitely in need of that subtly-flavoured Salted Caramel ice-cream that is served atop the crunchy crumbles beside it for that complimenting touch. The br√ªl√©e bananas weren\'t overly sweet for they aren\'t caramalised unlike how certain places do it, and came with a satisfying, crackling layer of sugar melted over it. Definitely a really great way to end the meal!
From South Union Park\'s Prix Fixe Set Lunch menu (2 courses @ $18, 3 courses @ $21 ‚Äî both includes coffee/tea); there is a choice between a burger and this pasta (which is exclusive I their set lunch menu) for the mains. Pasta are as usual, made lovingly in-house here; I loved how each piece carries a good amount of bite with its chewiness. Tossed in a tomato-based sauce, I enjoyed how the entire dish went well with one another; bright, tangy sweetness that goes so well with the savoury pulled beef brisket that was immensely flavourful and was aplenty in the plate of pasta. I have always enjoyed South Union Park\'s pasta dishes such as the Agnolotti and the Duck Confit pasta, and this had certainly met all the expectations that I have had with satisfaction guaranteed.
Trying the Prix Fixe Set Menu for lunch at South Union Park which is newly introduced today; $18 for a two-course or $21 for a three course ‚Äî both inclusive of coffee/tea. Opted for the latter and the appetizer I chose (there is two choices for each category) is the Smoked Tomato Soup. Quite surprised by how this one turned out; a thick soup without the use of cream to thicken things up ‚Äî flavoured well by the natural sweetness and tanginess of the tomatoes that gives a burst of freshness with every spoon. So much oomph from then natural flavour of tomatoes that is definitely one thing I would really love to get on a rainy day or to drink when I am having a flu for its just so bright and heartwarming!
.\n<br />Nobody else does apple crumble using a whole apple like they do.\n<br />.\n<br />Best paired with its vanilla ice cream and yogurt dressing drizzled with butterscotch.\n<br />.\n<br />How I missed their freshly made pasta, time for a revisit soon?
Recommended by the staff as the pies were freshly baked, and cherries were seasonal. The warm pie and cold ice-cream ended the meal off perfectly. The pie crust wasn\'t too thick, and afterall, homemade is best. First time trying cherry pie and it is a pleasant experience
Agnolotti filled with generous creamy butternut squash, served in a butter emulsion with earthy mushrooms. The butternut was delicious, but after awhile got boring as it was just dumpling after dumpling. Some agnolotti(looks like ravioli to me) ends were a tad bit hard as well. But the dish was well-balanced and wholesome.
Freshly made tagliatelle pasta tossed up in hazelnut cream and spinach, topped off with pulled duck confit.\n<br />A refreshing take to cream pasta, which was addictive and surprisingly light. The lemon zest and chopped up hazelnut brought layers to creamy dish.\n<br />One of the few cafes that have unique dishes that not only look great but taste fantastic!\n<br />Monster will be back!\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #southunionpark #burpple
Duck Confit was good. Hazelnut cream was light and wasn\'t overwhelming. Duck Confit isn\'t the crispy kind you eat outside, it\'s soft and tender. Overall, a very well done dish. Not forgetting the fried chicken...... Crispy and juicy, every bite with juice exploding in your mouth. Can\'t seem to stop after one mouthful. Corn bread was amazing too. Was a little dry but if you eat it together with the honey butter, it\'s pretty amazing.
Got to try one of their classics on the menu which recently got a revamp ‚Äî a combination of roasted vegetables, Quinoa and Asian Vinaigrette. Here you are getting a mish-mash of everything for both flavours and texture ‚Äî the salad tasting pretty sweet with the pumpkin, tangy from the dressing and umami with the grilled broccoli florets (grilled broccoli always gets me excited); overall a great combination that is quite uplifting and not quite the usual salad. Texturally, the crunchiness of the roasted pumpkins, the Quinoa grains (which was well-prepared without being sandy or grainy) and the crisp broccoli worked magic together so you get quite a bit of bite rather than being flat and monotonous. Thanks to Chef Terrence who fired a small portion of this while we were in the process of enjoying a plate of my favourite Butternut Agnolotti to let us try something new!
Homemade Agnolotti filled with butternut squash with butter emulsion, mushrooms and garlic herb crumbs.\n<br />Out of the homemade pastas at South Union Park, we tried this and the Short Rib Ragu‚Ä¶ my personal favourite would be this Butternut pasta as it has a sweeter note and lighter flavours. I\'d definitely go back for this again.\n<br />#SouthUnionPark #HomemadePasta
Apple crumble deconstructed style. Where you take a bit of everything and bite. Well stewed apple, icecream top with caramel. Greek yogurt. Oh - how I love the crumble.
Comforting¬†Butternut agnolotti with john. Butternut squash filling inside this homemade pasta. Who needs meat?
That\'s what South Union Park promises. Take their ragu for example: bouncy al-dente homemade tagliatelle, tossed in a tangy and rich roasted tomato sauce, with lotsa tender, melt-in-your-mouth chunks of short ribs. Don\'t expect something straight outta Masterchef; if you\'re looking for something made with lotsa heart and love, then give this a go.
Short Rib Ragu Pasta ($22) - slow-cooked, the short rib is fork-tender, and flavourful. Thoroughly enjoyed this perfectly al dente, freshly-made tagliatelle with rich tomato sauce, topped generously with Parmesan cheese, definitely will be back!!! üòå
Delicious pasta with great starters and dessert! The apple grumble was so good that I didn\'t manage to take photo of it before it was gone. The passion fruit souffle was a bit too sweet of my liking thou. And also! The ragu pasta and the fries were superb!
Just based on its appearance, you wouldn\'t have guessed that this plain ol\' chocolate looking cake uses yoghurt as one of its ingredients. The sponge was chocolatey, light and delightfully moist, but I wasn\'t really a fan of the slight hints of sourness that kept bugging me from start to end. A change in name might help to better represent it! 
Duck confit wasn\'t the crispy sort, but it was tender and flavourful. The flavour combinations were simple, yet well-thought out. Creamed spinach refreshed the palate with a tinge of bitterness, while lemon zest gave it a nice lift.\n<br />#pastalavistababy #burpple #southunionpark
Honestly surprised at how good this was! Suuuuuper moist and buttery brownie, topped with some badass salted caramel ice cream, crunchy candied walnuts, and lots of butterscotch. The candied walnuts  were a tad too hard and tasted a little burnt, but u can kinda ignore it by burying in heaps of awesome ice cream and brownie. Nothing really fancy, just a hearty chocolatey bite.
Didn\'t expect to like these much, but their Fried Chicken side was super addictive?! Aside from the epic well-fried-insanely-delish chicken pieces, the accompanying corn bread and whipped honey butter aren\'t to be sidelined. Moist, chewy, and sweet, the bite-sized corn bread was fantastic alone; but slather it with that salty-sweet creamy butter, and my oh my it\'s a whole new ballgame.
It may puzzle some to hear how easily excited I get on hearing \"pork crackling\", but you\'d prolly get it if you gave the ones at South Union Park a go. Superduperinsanely crisp, not the least bit greasy, tossed in an addictive Cajun salt ‚Äî really, how can you resist that? If you\'re afraid of the calories, don\'t be. Run 10km after this. It\'s worth it.
Then hints of lemongrass started to come through, accentuating the natural sweetness of the fresh crab meat and giving it a Thai spin. What a pleasant surprise. Great on its own and to spice things up a little, smear on some red pepper remoulade that\'s served on the side.
This pillowy, almost molten bundle of chocolaty goodness yielded effortlessly under the fork and in the mouth. Absolutely delightful with salted caramel ice cream, butterscotch, and crunchy candied walnuts. Will gladly pay $9 for this again.
The rave reviews from fellow Tastemakers made me super excited to try this dish, and it definitely lived up to its hype. Silky parcels filled with sweet butternut squash, swathed in a pool of aromatic brown butter emulsion along with juicy mushrooms, finished with garlic herb crumbs on top. So good you\'ll not wanna share.
Thanks to these decadent fries, I now have to force myself to the gym today! I was just heading to South Union Park last night for some of their beyond-delish Butternut Squash Pasta ($17) when these came along and blew my diet away! And since I was on a roll, I ended off the night with their coffee-liquer soaked, pistachio topped, Tiramisu ($6) as well. Another yummy outing to this fabulous bistro in kembangan! \n<br />Full review at http://thedivaeatsprata.com/south-union-park/
The duck confit pasta was amazing! The duck meat was chewy and meaty and complemented the light hazelnut cream that coated each strand of pasta perfectly. A sprinkling of lemon zest brought a zing to the dish (way better than just a lame squeeze of lemon) and chopped hazelnuts lent texture to the dish. It was crazy how perfect the portion of cream to pasta was! Plus the cream kept all the hazelnuts coated to the pasta so I never had to use my spoon to pick up extra bits. Each strand gave me the perfect mix of pasta, duck, lemon and hazelnut. The dish was honestly light (yet flavourful) enough to fill me up but keep me from feeling stuffed and heavy. Where to find!! Plus the place: bright and airy. Just like Australia. Plus the chef\'s love and dedication for food was really inspiring. Really.
The chef/owner served this complimentary, with a salted caramel ice-cream on the side. Baked fresh in-house, this cake may look like just another chocolate cake but that moistness and richness of flavour within the cake is really indulgent. The smooth and luscious chocolate glazing, which was done with simply the same dark chocolate and a little yogurt gives off a chocolatey yet tangy and fruity flavour which I personally found intriguing for the complexity of flavours within the chocolate. Salted caramel ice-cream was also decent without being overly harsh on flavours. Definitely something that is quite unlike the usual chocolate cake out there.
According to the chef/owner, he had told me that they have changed the way that they do coffee ever since my first visit during my second time here which I skipped coffee. Having tried the improved coffee, the coffee itself isn\'t as milky as what it was before, but overall the temperature in which it was served was a little too hot (to the extent that it was tongue-scalding) and hence caused the coffee to be a little bit bitter. Gave the necessary feedback and they are already actively looking into it; perhaps they just need some time for more practice and work into the craft. Still, do come here for the food because the food is really top-notch for the price!
The South Australian mussels tasted really fresh and juicy with a touch of saltiness. There was also a hint of wine from the chorizo broth which brought out the sweetness of the mussels. 
May seemed that the sauce was too little but rest assured the flavour covered all of the fries. (Though it wouldn\'t hurt to have more gravy and cheese right üòô) Happy Fries-yay guys üçüüçüüçü
.\n<br />Warm and fuzzy chocolate brownie to go with butterscotch ice cream and drizzled with salted caramel. The addition of candied walnuts brought out another level of fragrance to the same old usual brownie.\n<br />.\n<br />Sometimes it is the most ordinary dessert which turns out to be extraordinary.
Texture wise, this tagliatelle is thin, broad and easily broken with a bite of the teeth. The short rib - tender and ah Ma Liu friendly üëçüèª Maybe due to the sudden influx of people over the weekends, the pasta were slightly clumpy as compared to my last visit.
Whole apple baked with a thin layer of skin and warm softened flesh, served with biscuit crumble, yoghurt, vanilla ice cream and butterscotch sauce. Eat it separately to enjoy the sour-sweet apple flavours, or have a little of everything to enjoy the different textures/temperature.
Besides the ever-popular Short Rib Ragu, Duck Confit Pasta and Apple Crumble dessert which you will see popping up in many Instagram accounts, I feel that the Butternut Pasta ($17) is very underrated which deserves more recognition.\n<br />.\n<br />Using fresh agnolotti, a type of pasta dough folded over a filling of butternut squash, it is cooked in a butter emulsion with mushrooms and finished with a sprinkle of garlic herb crumbs. The sweetness from the butternut squash definitely appeals to those with a sweet tooth while the butter emulsion and mushrooms add a savoury touch.\n<br />.\n<br />South Union Park\n<br />Address: 101, Jalan Kembangan, Singapore 419139
The Brownie ($9) is of a softer consistency as compared to the other conventional ones and served with candied walnuts, butterscotch and vanilla ice cream (with squeezes of salted caramel twirls). It can be quite sweet initially but the salted caramel balances out the sweetness, making it a very delightful dessert.
This is because this Apple Crumble ($10) is really quite something. A whole Granny Smith Apple that has been cooked till it softens and served with vanilla ice cream (with butterscotch twirls), nutty crumbs and yogurt. You will experience many layers of flavours from the tanginess of the yogurt, milkiness of the ice cream and nuttiness of the crumbs. Eat everything, including a cut of the apple, in a single spoonful for the maximum pleasure.
Served al dente style, the Duck Confit ($19) uses fresh tagliatelle and cooked with saut√©ed spinach and hazelnut cream. The shredded duck is slightly too savoury today, but besides that, most are pretty on point.
Definitely my favourite of the pasta choices.
The taste and smell of passionfruit is prominent in this fluffy souffleüëç
Give it to them for coming up with this take on the old Favourite. But old favourites are favourites for a reason. Don\'t fix what\'s not broken..old is gold...Yada yada. The baked whole Granny Smith was undercooked (it took much force with my knife to cut it up), and because it\'s a whole apple, there\'s less surface area for the delicious cinnamony sugary goodness to infuse into the fruit, leaving the inner parts bland. The vanilla ice cream was quality though, with real vanilla specks. With the yogurt sauce, I felt the individual components of this dessert didn\'t come together well.
It is what it is. Fried chicken. And corn bread. Not quite sure what condiment that is- mayo? Sour cream? Didn\'t taste like much to be honest. The chicken was tender and seasoned enough, but the corn bread doesn\'t come close to Kenny Roger\'s. 
.\n<br />Meat so tender and hand-made pasta so springy. It\'s the simplicity of ingredients used which brought out the true flavours at its finest.
Warning! This can be very addictive! The fries were soaked in duck gravy, cheese sauce and further added with crunchy duck skin ‚Äì salty and sinfully good.
I\'ve only eaten two other souffl√©s in my life, but I knew those didn\'t seem like they had the right textures based on what I saw on Masterchef programmes (there\'s always a souffl√© challenge every season!) So me saying that the passionfruit souffl√© here is the best I\'ve ever had is very insignificant, but I\'m glad I\'m not the only one who loved it.\n<br />:\n<br />The brown thin crust on top revealed nothing of the pillowy almost-whipped-cream-like insides until your spoon breaks through. It is surprisingly sturdy for such an airy dessert. The passionfruit flavour was delightfully tangy, very suitable to end off a heavy meal. Even the \"ulu\" location will not stop me from returning to enjoy this again!
Sometimes the little ones deserve the spotlight too. Like @southunionpark and their little nuggets of cornbread with whipped honey butter. My ideal peaceful afternoon would involve mindlessly lounging over a book, couple of iced cappuccinos, popping more than a dozen of these savoury-sweet golden polenta pillows. \n<br />Corn breads currently only are available in threes with every order of fried chicken, so if you\'re sharing with friends, you\'d best have the fastest fingers!
This is an entire granny smith apple stewed till it is soft and jammy on the inside, and serve it warm alongside greek yoghurt, crunchy crumble, smooth vanilla bean ice cream and top it all off with generous drizzles of butterscotch.
Aeration game strong with this slightly tangy fruit-based souffl√©. Sugary exterior crust on point, down to the piping hot fluffy inerts, copper pots and specially crafted brown leather sleeve to ensure that guests don\'t burn themselves whilst indulging. Very thoughtful, @terence_chuah. \n<br />Best souffl√© in town alongside restaurants Cut and Spago. Requires a 20minute prep time, so be sure to order in advance. \n<br />Typically closed on Mondays. \n<br />13bucks/souffl√© \n<br />#FTrecommends
Braved the sun today and took a sweaty walk to South Union Park near Kembangan. \n<br />A very quaint cafe located in a residential area, they serve top notch food and without the typical shortcuts most cafes normally take. Their pastas are all made in house and even their Chorizo is made by them. \n<br />One of the stand out dishes, the mussels were fresh and tasted of the sea. Soft, plump (some were huge!) and salty, it went great with that savory, spicy broth. \n<br />#Burpple #BurppleSG #bodyplump #whyidonthaveabs #fatdieme #SouthUnionPark #worththesweatywalk
We ordered a couple of pasta mains as they were recommended by the staff and all the pasta here is made my hand. \n<br />Certainly, we were pleasantly surprised by the results. Al dente  goodness, the Duck Confit Cream pasta was light and a refreshing departure from normally cloying cream pastas. \n<br />I personally loved my Butternut Squash Agnolotti (something like a raviolli). Creamy and sweet, it mixed amazingly with the butter emulsion and even better with that umami kick from the mushrooms! \n<br />Really quaint place that seems great for slow evenings but next time I\'m headed over, I\'ll be sure to avoid walking in the midday sun üòì
This was a surprisingly good dish with al dente pasta , sauteed spinach, hazelnut creme and soft tender duck. A must try!!
Plump Granny Smith apple stewed till intensely sweet, soft and jam-like within, accompanied by salty crumble and smooth vanilla bean ice cream topped with a swirl of sticky butterscotch. I found the pool of Greek yoghurt below a little too overwhelmingly sour, given the slight tartness already present in the apple. Perhaps a substitution of creme anglais or creme fraiche would have been more to my liking.
Light as a cloud, this souffle got a rise out of me with its beautifully fluffy texture, balanced sweetness and smooth, slightly tart passionfruit flavour. Remember to order 20 minutes in advance if you don\'t want to wait overly long for it.
As if their mains weren\'t good enough, the desserts really shine here as well. The dense brownie possessed a deep, dark chocolate richness lesser brownies can only dream of, while the salted caramel ice cream was reminiscent of a Willy Wonka-esque Christmas tree bauble, studded with sticky, crunchy candied walnut and drizzled butterscotch. 
The shredded duck confit committed identity theft by deftly assuming a pulled pork-esque texture, whilst elsewhere, hazelnuts provided much needed crunch and wilted spinach lay defeated like a tri-athlete after a particularly gruelling ironman challenge. Kek.
Dainty parcels of butternut squash puree filled agnolotti in a pool of butter emulsion and earthy mushrooms, topped with garlic herb crumb. A taste of autumn with every spoonful of silky pasta, which is all handmade here by the way.
Umami mia! Ribbony sheets of tagliatelle swaddled in a deeply rich and intensely flavourful roasted tomato sauce, then topped with the most fall-apart chunks of beef ever and a generous handful of parmesan. The fifth taste is strong in this one.
It\'s under starters on the menu, but this hearty salad of quinoa and seasonal vegetables(we got roasted sweet potato, carrot and parsnip, I think) with asian vinaigrette could easily double as a vegetarian main.
Finally trying the dessert I was eyeing on ever since my very first time visiting this spot. The flavour of the day was Passionfruit, and the fluffy souffl√© was light, airy and subtly sweet spiked with a little tanginess from the Passionfruit which gives it a rather uplifting touch. Definitely something to go for since it doesn\'t really take much stomach space and ends the meal on a good note while cleansing up the palate at the same time.
Always having a feast whenever I am here; got to try one of the new dishes served complimentary that is not listed in the menu. Usually served with fries (the chef left them out for we were quite filled with the pasta), the Mussels were fresh arrivals of the day and the Chorizo made in-house, the mussels were plump and fresh; rid of any undesired stench while the chorizo was chunky and savoury. Cooked in a broth, the broth was immensely savoury and could even be salty for some, but the flavour was still clean and addictive once you have a second spoonful that it just gets one going. Certainly one of the dishes here that would definitely go well with some drinks to chill. Thanks to the chef/owner for the complimentary treat!
Tagliatelle, Saut√©ed Spinach, Hazelnut Cream. Got quite hooked to the pasta ever since trying their Butternut the previous time I came by. Tagliatelle was done al-dente, absorbing the light flavours of the brined duck while tossed in a cream sauce speckled with traces of hazelnuts for a little sweetness in the pasta. The duck meat was moist and tender, despite being shredded, while the spinach gave it a slightly more wholesome touch. Quite something that I liked for how the flavours just simply integrate together as one in the pasta, while most other pastas in the price range somehow lacks.
The actual portion of the Pork Cracklings from South Union Park. Arriving hot off the fryer, you can actually hear the popping and crackling as it arrives on the table for a while before it becomes slightly cooler. Coming with an ample amount of paprika and salt to flavour, these were definitely more flavourful than the complimentary portion I had previously, yet still surprisingly crisp without being greasy, and that light whiff of porkiness which makes it so well-balanced.
Believe it or not, no eggs were used while making this souffle. I was pretty impressed upon first bite. I\'ll be back to try their mains soon!
.\n<br />Flavour of the day turned out to be passionfruit and it was a pleasant surprise to find soury profile of passionfruit actually blended well with the light and fluffy baked egg dessert.\n<br />.\n<br />Good things are worth the wait, and waiting time for this is approximately 20mins.
It had a strong hint of butter, while being sweet at the same time, well complementing the mushrooms and garlic herb crumbs that was sprinkled on top, which provided a savoury and umami taste to balance!
This cosy restaurant near Kembangan MRT dishes out quality Western fare at affordable prices. Swing by for a casual date night and go straight for the mains like the comforting Butternut Pasta ($17) ‚Äî homemade tagliatelle packed with roasted squash and tossed with mushrooms and string cheese. End the meal with a sweet treat like the Apple Crumble ($10), vanilla ice cream drizzled with salted caramel, chunky crumbles, Greek yogurt and a whole stewed apple bursting with natural sweetness.
The salty, buttery crumble would evoke fond, nostalgic memories of childhood noshing of Danish butter cookies, the very plump and sweet apple possesses a heady, enthusiastic sweetness and the stringy butterscotch has a pontianak-esque clinginess. 3.9/5
NEWLY OPENED! this place only opened recently and i am so excited because this cafe is only one minute\'s walk from my house! i liked the ambience of the place, it had the chilled, relaxed kind of feel. the Poached Salmon ($20) caught my eye while i was looking through the menu, probably because i was craving for it! the salmon was not fully cooked, and it was more raw than cooked. i didn\'t mind, of course. i was able to peel off the flesh easily! combining it with the sweet onion salad and cous cous with raisins, it had a good mix of flavour which made me very pleased. i\'m quite sad i didn\'t manage to try their desserts, apparently they are pretty decent! the waiting time was a little long, food a little pricey, and the menu selection was pretty limited but i heard they are going to add on more variety, just not sure when. can\'t wait though! 
The meepok-esque homemade tagliatelle had a rustic, earnest firmness, whilst elsewhere the duck was appetisingly salty and the citrusy zest and nuts would elicit an intrigued huh from your lips. 3.7/5
Was quite inclined to give their Souffl√© a try but they creeped up behind me again with a complimentary Apple Crumble. Pretty innovative in its presentation, their version doesn\'t come in a pie form but rather, a plated format that comes with Vanilla ice-cream drizzled with salted caramel, Crumbles, Greek Yogurt and a whole stewed apple ‚Äî yes you read it right; a full apple. This was absolutely on point; the Apple was immensely soft, but not at all too sweet for there isn\'t any caramel in here; only flavoured by its natural sweetness. The crumbly bits gave it a nice touch, and the Greek Yogurt gave it a muesli-like touch. The accompanying vanilla ice-cream is specked with vanilla beans; immensely aromatic and delightful especially when you combine every single element to a spoonful as the sweetness is pretty balanced. Really, really well done. Be warned though; the seeds within are not removed so do exercise just a little caution while eating just in case ;)
Agnolotti, Butter Emulsion, Mushrooms, Garlic Herb Crumbs. I rarely order pasta, especially Tagliatelle for how filling it can be but this was so delicious that it\'s effortless to finish the entire plate. According to the owners, the chef roasts the squash, before mashing up the squash and packing them into the pasta sheets. Made just to the right thickness, the tagliatelle delightfully squirts of a roasty sweetness with the juices bursting out on the cue of a bite, which goes so well with the bouncy, earthy mushrooms, savoury stringy cheese scattered above and a little garlicky flavour from the garlic herb crumbs. The only gripe is that it can feel a bit oily towards the end, but who minds about that when this is just so mindblowingly delicious!
Served complimentary by the chef, the actual portion at $5 on the menu of this is actually bigger than pictured. This is actually made from pork skin, fried into a dried, cracker form which was actually pretty interesting as a beer bite. It\'s crispness was akin to Keropok, and that mix of salt and Cajun spices definitely helped lift the flavours of these little pleasures pretty well!
Despite this looking like your regular breakfast menu items, this is not ordinary at all. In fact, this has been one of my more enjoyable caf√© breakfast plates for a very long time. Think everything homemade from English muffins, sausage patties, and tater tots to jam spread that will surely delight your tummy. What‚Äôs even amazing that all these cost at an affordable $15 nett, which is a far cry from your usual expensive breakfast set meal. South Union Park has done it once again; they have raised the bar so high that this will be my caf√© breakfast benchmark moving forward.\n<br />_________________\n<br />South Union Park\n<br />Address: 101, Jalan Kembangan, Singapore 419139\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes

With salted caramel ice cream, candied walnuts and butterscotch. This was truly the best brownie I\'ve had in a while.

Or more accurately, my mouth as this is typically not served during lunch
So soft and \"milky\".. I am in love \n<br />The cauliflower puree sitting at the base of the dish tastes wonderful too! Mild but creamy, wonderful complement to the dish
Latte ($4.50) was decent. 
So smooth with  fine bits of coconut embeded in it
From the candied orange ginger and the pistachio seeds forming the canopy to the velvety white frozen yoghurt, the passion fruit white chocolate ganache in the crumbly carrot cake and finally the carrot puree forming the base, the smooth blend of the different flavours and textures in each layer is truly impressive.\n<br />To come up with a dessert that is both appetising and aesthetically pleasing, you just have to take your hat off to the creative minds of South Union Park.\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you Terence, Jade and the staff of @southunionpark for being so accomodating and hospitable!\n<br />.\n<br />üèö101 Jalan Kembangan \n<br />Singapore 419139\n<br />.\n<br />üïöOpening Hours: \n<br />Tues 5:30 pm ‚Äì 10.00 pm\n<br />Wed - Sun 11:30 am ‚Äì 10.00 pm\n<br />Closed Mon\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤Damage: $14.00\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #instafoodie #cafehoppingsg #nomnom #foodstagram #singapore #igfoodies #onthetable #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #onthetable #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #whati8today #f52grams #hungrygowhere #burpple #burpplesg

My second time having this. Fresh, plump and juicy mussels soaked in chorizo sauce and there were lotsa garlic to tickle your palate. Freshly toasted buttered brioche is provided for you to dunk in and soak up all the gravy.  It is a tad salty but with the brioche, it tones down the sodium slightly.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Terence, the owner, explained that these were airflown fresh from Australia. The mussels were then cleaned, scrubbed and the beards removed by hand. Tedious misen place. I can appreciate every single mussel I devoured knowing the lovingly and painstakingly effort being put in.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />The last time I visited was before Mother\'s Day 2016. I am impressed that Terence remembered me and the first time I visited. A double plus plus for that human touch!! Thanks Terence @southunionparksg ... you are one of the most humble chef/owner I have met and always good to chat with you every time.
I just wished that the pear was soft that it just crumbles in the mouth
It was thick and extremely good that I was scraping the plate
Just wished there were more parsley sprinkled on it though and I can\'t get enough of the beef chunks
Mussels ($18)
Poutine ($11)
Coupled with the melange of wing beans, cucumber, cherry tomatoes and olives, its flavour is further enhanced by the balsamic vinegar and the tartness of the condiments will activate your tastebuds for the mains ahead
Pasta is cooked to al-dente perfection, while the hazelnut cream does a fine job in providing a nutty accompaniment to the shredded duck.

In this dish, the fries absorb the essence of both the duck gravy and the cheese sauce and as a result, there is this feistiness which makes it really addictive\n<br />You will be raving non stop on how duck gravy can bring such a delectable transformation to the shoestring fries
But once you give rein to your palate by indulging in the meat friendly pasta, the soft and luscious beef ragu is pleasantly tantalizing with a melt in your mouth texture and soon you will be yielding to its tender succulence. \n<br />The home made pasta is exquisitely made in the shape of a \'worm\' and the parmesan cheese emanate this distinct fragrance that will make you desire it even more.

There\'s all sorts of smooth, nutty, caramelly, buttery notes in this dessert. Simple, no nonsense and absolutely delicious. #burpple #southunionpark
If you\'re nuts about pistachios, you\'ll be besotted with this. They\'re so generous with the nut that I did feel the stellar tiramisu itself got a little overshadowed at times. Nonetheless, I still scraped every bit of that jar clean üòÑ

Don\'t be mistaken; this may look like their Butternut Agnolotti but it\'s actually the Gnocchi from the new menu that drops this week (since Tuesday dinner; the Butternut Agnolotti has been axed in the new menu). Expect really soft and fluffy house-made gnocchi here that comes lightly crusted ‚Äî none of that overly firm and too chewy Gnocchi here. There is a very specific light but detectable hint of corn\'s natural sweetness throughout the entire plate from the corn pur√©e and roasted corn nibs here, giving it a rather umami flavour with the garlic herb crumbs and earthy mushrooms ‚Äî I actually found myself loving this even though I am no corn lover! Definitely one of the new must-try dishes at South Union Park!
I don\'t fancy chocolate desserts, but I think I can be bribed easily with a very good brownie. Just swung by for some desserts and settled for this ‚Äî the only item in the current dessert menu item I have yet to try. Extremely decadent and so luscious; the chocolate brownie is like eating warm, melted chocolate being so smooth like as though it\'s ganache ‚Äî so rich at the same time. Complimented with their signature Salted Caramel Ice-Cream (always smooth and creamy and tastefully salted without being too sweet) and candied walnuts that gives a sweet crunch. Simply perfection.

This was the duck confit tagliatelle with hazelnut cream. It was... One of those moments when you look at your empty plate and feel sad cos there\'s no more left. Plus the fried chicken and corn muffins with honey butter was one of the tastiest sides I\'ve ever had. Hello fat camp.\n<br />‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />#Vsco | #Vscocam | #Vscophile | #SouthUnionPark | #VscoFood | #Webstagram | #Pasta | #DuckConfit | #ExploreToCreate | #Instagoodmyphoto | #DiscoverDifferent | #ExploreEverything | #WhatI8today | #PhotoOfTheDay | #Instadaily | #CafeHopping | #Burpple | #BurppleSG | #SGIG | #ExploreSingapore | #Shiok | #SgEats | #EatLocal | #JiakLocal

The plated desserts may be what everyone is trying here, after all who can resist a souffl√© and the aesthetically pleasing Apple Crumble here? That being said, the assortment of cakes in the chiller also makes for a good post-meal dessert for the cakes are all made by themselves. This Tiramisu achieves a good balance of cream cheese and coffee-soaked sponge so there is never a moment it feels either too creamy or too cakey. Cream cheese was smooth and light, but not too the extent of being airy, while there is ample cocoa flavour going around without feeling as though it was going to steal the show away from the dessert. Coupled with the chopped pistachios over the top, it adds just enough crunchiness to give it a little contrast in texture. Definitely a good tea time treat to have for its a pretty light-flavoured yet indulging dessert to spoil yourself with.
Crackling pork with no meat. Airy and crispy. Best with cold beer. #cracklingpork #fried #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igsg #igers #singaporeinsiders #chopesg #instafollow #instameetsg

Apple crumble, cheeseburger, pasta duck confit. 
The fried chorizo, made in house (!!), was really good and Super addictive! Wish there was more of the broth to dip my fries with though!
Soo good !üëå
Another handmade pasta that was satisfying.
Freshly made tagliatelle with generous chunks of oh so tender short ribs .
Not overly sweet and balanced off with the citrussy &amp; tangyness. Quite a delightful dessert or teabreak that does not make one feel \"heavy\". #souffles #dessertlovers #dessert #pastrychefs #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #opensnap #stfoodtrending #newrestaurant #cafesg #burpple #yelpsg #singaporeinsiders #tripadvisor #sgfoodies #bloggersg #foodporn #instafollow #southunionpark #sgbloggers #foodspotting
Located off the beaten track, nestled among the private residences, it has a cool, homey &amp; cozy interior. \n<br />Fresh plump juicy mussels in chorizo broth. Mussels were imported live from Australia. No fishy smell, it was quite addictive when eaten with the slightly salty chorizo. \n<br />Thank you Terence @southunionpark for the warm hospitality, great service and the wonderful conversation. Will certainly visit again.\n<br />Address: 101 Jalan Kembangan\n<br />Nearest mrt : Kembangan\n<br />Turn left from exit, walk afew metres to traffic light (dont cross) then turn left &amp; walk straight up all the way. A 10 min walk.\n<br />#lunch #newrestaurant #mussels\n<br />#hungrygowhere #burpple #opensnap #i8mondays #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #bloggersg #singaporeinsiders #tripadvisor #igers #igsg #instafollow #southunionpark
What better way that to start it off with some Pork Crackling! Crackled so much that it was still crackling when served with a dose of cajun salt sprinkled all over. Nature\'s keropok!
.\n<br />Easties can now chill over a cup of coffee while indulge in freshly hand made pasta for the lazy afternoon.
