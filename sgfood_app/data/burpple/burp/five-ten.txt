Steak with crispy garlic oil &amp; pickled chinese cabbage ($10) was juicy and tender on its own. Eat the steak together with the pickled cabbage to add a new dimension to its taste. *Recommended*
And that\'s what you can expect as they served Taiwanese cuisine in tapas portion at either $5 or $10. Weekday lunch consist of rice bowls while weekday dinner and weekends are sharing plates with free flow of rice.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Simple side dishes like Baby Kai Lan, Fried Smashed Potatoes and Fried Chicken are available. Potatoes was my favourite, deep fried baby potatoes with skin on and seasoned with chilli peppers and plum powder, it\'s quite addictive. Don\'t miss ordering their Lu Rou ($10) too! Pork belly braised in housemade soy sauce, the tender flavourful meat just melts in your mouth.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Five.Ten\n<br />Address: 237 South Bridge Rd, Singapore 058786\n<br />#fivetensg
Steak rice bowl for $10++ \n<br />Juicy Beer tenderloin rice bowl compliment with soft boiled egg and pickles.
Five Ten Squid - grilled to a smoky, asian style flavour. Every chopstick-ful was chewy springy and not cloying at all. Cost? Only $10. As with all the small plates on the menu which are either $5/$10. Taiwanese-inspired menu in a hipster bar setting and food that\'s fun,  delicious and great with the drinks from the in-house bar. Review of Five Ten at Chinatown on the blog herpenandfork.blogspot.sg
The Lu Rou was wonderfully tender and melted in my mouth. The Steak with Pickles was succulent on its own without any sauce. The Pork Ribs were coated with tasty Hoisin Sauce and were moist and juicy.
Pork Ribs ($10) and Grilled Squid ($10) ‚Äî among the 2 that most impressed during today\'s lunch. The former was mad tasty, not simply coated in a sticky Hoisin sauce but having all that lovely savoury-sweet flavours seep into the meat, while staying utterly moist and juicy. If anything it was too fatty for me, but I\'m sure that wouldn\'t be an issue to most. As for the squid: smokey, wonderfully charred, perfectly cooked. \'Nuff said. Then again with so many trusted Burpple Tastemakers giving their thumbs up to FIVE TEN, I wouldn\'t expect anything less.
That with a bowl of üçö is what I am craving for now. Tapas (and everything else) priced at $5 and $10, you\'ll be back 5-10 times a month...I know I have hit the \"quota\" already üòÇüôå
The Lu Rou features pork belly braised in housemade soy sauce. The flavourful meat was wonderfully tender and melted oh so slowly¬†in my¬†mouth.
The seemingly classic night market snack begins with hearty spice notes, then to an intriguing complexity of Shaoxing wine and smokiness. Enjoy it with side of pickled veg for added crunch and dimension. #MediaTasting #FindNewFood
$10.00
Tender, juicy and cooked to perfection. This seared sirloin steak stole my heart. The fried garlic and cabbage hidden under the slices of beef were also a great addition in helping to add different textures to the dish. 
Thinly sliced seared Sirloin on a bed of pickled Chinese cabbage and crispy minced garlic. Everything seasoned to perfection; definitely a favourite here at @fivetensg. \n<br />10bucks/serve
You read that right ‚Äî this casual joint in Chinatown dishes out sharing plates, rice bowls and sandwiches that are priced at either $5 or $10. The food is very good (we hear the kitchen is helmed by former sous chef of Salted &amp; Hung) and there are communal tables to accommodate large groups, making this two-week-old spot a popular one with those working nearby. At lunch, start with the addictively tasty Fried Smashed Potatoes ($5) and the Fried Chicken ($5) served with a squeeze of house made nori mayonnaise on the side. The menu reminds us of a playful take on Taiwanese street snacks. Sink your teeth into the crowd favourite Steak Sandwich ($10), where a nicely grilled steak is sliced into bite-sized pieces, topped with a generous portion of caramelised onions and slathered with bearnaise. All this is sandwiched between two slices of toasted bread that provide just the right ratio of meat to bread. For something heartier, go for the Lu Rou Fan ($10), a rice bowl topped with thick chunks of what we deem as the most tender braised pork belly, a sous vide egg and kai lan. Pro tip: Swing by at dinner with your colleagues and kick back with half a pint of beer, all priced at $5! \n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
All items at Five Ten costs either $5 or $10. This Lu Rou Fan ($10) is one of their star mains here. A perfectly braised pork belly, a wobbly egg and some green Kai lan atop a mound of drenched rice. The star of the dish is definitely the fatty pork belly, which melts in the mouth and tears at the lightest of touch. 
These $5 small plates are perfect for sharing. On the left we have the Fried Chicken with Nori Mayonnaise. The crunchy chicken bits were not at all oily, super crispy and I suspect will go very well with their $5 Asahi beer. The Taukwa (pictured on the right) is topped with fried ginger and century eggs. It\'s dipped in a black sauce which we also dipped the fried chicken in cause it\'s so yummy.
That Cold Brew Soda (one on the right) was a personal favourite of the lot. Lightly fizzy with a nice touch of acidity, good kick of caffeine without it being overly sweet; playing a very complimentary role to the food served here. \n<br />5bucks/serve
Newly opened restaurant (at the now defunct Cato), helmed by Chef Shawn slings out Chinese/Taiwanese-inspired comfort food in small portions, where everything on their menu, drinks included, are priced at five or ten bucks before taxes. \n<br />10bucks/serve
This gorgeous pork belly was tender to the chopsticks, melted in our mouths and ohh sooo juicy and flavourful. Whatever they put in that sauce, they should just do it with everything else (there is another dish with the same sauce üòÇ)...orgasmic...mmmm
Love how the texture of the century eggs play with the Tau Kwa (fried bean curd). The warmth from the squares, coupled with the sauce and eggs were reminiscent of that winter\'s day at a Taipei street stall.
This was interestingly made by soaking coffee in milk, though wasn\'t sure this was a good move. This gave the cold brew a slightly off taste.
Dessert at @fivetensg in the form of miniature fried chewy Milk Roux served with a side of Dulce de Leche (aka caramelized condensed milk).\n<br />Dunk those gold nuggets into the Dulce de Leche dip for the full experience.\n<br />5bucks/serve
Newly opened joint helmed by Shawn (ex-sous chef of Salted &amp; Hung), slings out an all new Taiwanese Street Food inspired menu. \n<br />This was a halved grilled eggplant topped, with savoury crispy shrimp, cuttlefish and spring onions for an extra pop of freshness.\n<br />All menu items, drinks included, are priced either at 5bucks or 10bucks only, so bring along your gang to snag a couple of cheap beers and small sharing plates!
Probably inspired by the notorious Taiwanese street stalls\' Fried Chicken, Five Ten creates their own rendition of sesame-soy marinated fried chunks of chicken (they slipped in a couple of extra chicken skin pieces too) accompanied with an umami nori mayonnaise which I couldn\'t get enough of.
Saw this restaurant on Burpple a few days ago and went there heheh since it\'s somewhat near my workplace. The restaurant was quite quiet as there weren\'t many customers. This combined with the relative spaciousness of the restaurant made for a rather good eating and chilling experience. 
Unarguably melt in your mouth texture paired perfectly with light crisp bread! Something I foresee myself coming back for - so so good. Put this on your to order list! \n<br />The restaurant is interesting named Five Ten as the dishes are all priced either $5 or $10!
At the newly opened Five Ten where everything on the menu is either $5/$10! ü§ëThis sandwich, my friends, is a winner!
Waaaah this is the most melty, most wobbly pork belly ive ever tasted!! ü§§üòçüòò im not exactly a fan of any braised, but this bowl\'s really my one of a kind.
Refreshing, light-hearted, zesty and lil cool üëåjust the dish for starters. üëê
From Five Ten which is currently in soft launch phase situated at 237 South Bridge Road ‚Äî a F&amp;B establishment run by several folks that have quite a bit of experience within the F&amp;B/hospitality industry (bumped into quite a number of familiar faces from various establishments when I dined here). The menu features generally comfort food that comes with a slight Chinese/Taiwanese twist ‚Äî every item listed on the menu either costs $5++ or $10++; a pretty interesting concept overall.
One of the desserts available here, though not listed on the menu during the time of my visit. A concoction using chocolate, soda and a scoop of Cold Brew ice-cream that is churned by the folks at Apiary with the use of the cold brew at Five Ten as a base, this was a pretty dynamic dessert that has it flavour profile changing as time progresses. At the start, the dessert felt like three different elements. Shortly after, the richness of the chocolate start to get infused with the soda beneath ‚Äî a rather luxurious concoction that didn\'t feel overly sweet, while the ice-cream gives it another dimension of flavour as it gets scooped from the straw. A while later, the Cold Brew ice-cream manages to combine with the rest of the elements to create a creamy, chocolatey mix with a hint of coffee at the end ‚Äî a really indulgent combination of flavours that ends on a sweet but manageable note that felt pretty balanced overall.
Another one off the dessert menu ‚Äî fried milk fritters served with condensed milk on the side; their version of the Dulce Le Leche with a Chinese twist, as they call it. It is recommended to first enjoy the milk fritters on its own, before pouring in the condensed milk to let the remaining balls of fried milk to absorb the sweetness of the condensed milk. The balls of fried milk were brilliantly executed ‚Äî crisp, fried balls that were soft inside and carries a very light hint of milkiness, while the condensed milk helps to enhance the sweetness and flavours of the milk fritters. Pretty satisfying even as a light midday snack just for a bite!
Yet another brilliantly executed dish at Five Ten would be their Lu Rou Fan ‚Äî braised in a special sauce they had came up with, the braised pork belly was incredibly tender and flavourful having absorbed all the flavours from the braising process. It is also noted that the braised pork belly carried a good balance of meatiness and braised flavour without being too salty. The wobbly sous-vide egg was also well-executed with flowy egg yolk when poked with a fork, while the blanched kai lan gave a refreshing crunch without carrying any form of undesirable bitterness from the greens. Overall, pretty value for money for its quality at $10++!
Sesame &amp; Soy marinated chicken, nori mayonnaise. Something that would really pair well with beer as a bar bite ‚Äî these crispy morsels of chicken were tender and came with skin-on for a umami flavour especially with the seasoning over the top. Thought the nori mayonnaise was also pretty addictive; the Kewpie-esque mayonnaise seemed to carry a bit of dimension with the nori infused ‚Äî somewhat more umami and with more contrast that worked pretty well with the fried chicken.
There may not be espresso-based coffees available at Five Ten, but they do have quite a range of slightly different coffee options including these Cold Brews to pick from. Brewed using a custom blend specially roasted for them by Two Degrees North Coffee Co., the Cold Brew takes three days to brew; the White Cold Brew brewed only using milk and coffee with no added sugar and preservatives while the Brown Cold Brew is a concoction of White Cold Brew and their homemade chocolate sauce. Between the two, I probably am biased towards the Brown Cold Brew for its hint of chocolate at the front, before transiting into a nutty, caffeinated flavour for its finish ‚Äî it is also pretty balanced without being overly sweet, but still chocolatey enough for a Mocha-inspired drink. The White Cold Brew is still pretty good on its own; creamy, nutty and pretty soothing to drink without being anywhere sweet.

Sharing portions but they do have individual rice bowls as well. ü•Ñ\n<br />.\n<br />Love the concept that was adopted from a drinking game of Five Ten, there are some hits &amp; misses though.

Other than that it\'ll be the freshly churned Ice Cream that Apiary provides which is just a stone throw away. üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #FiveTen #FiveTenSG #meatshow #taiwanese #tapas #flatlay

üçó\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Fried Chicken, many lesser men might not even hold up, it\'s like cocaine for Humanity. The crispy savory allure of fat crisp through the paper thin brittle skin, juicy meat contained in the protective layers of seasoning &amp; marinates. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />Nothing explains fried chicken\'s uncanny grip on humanity of all backgrounds.

Been here many weeks before and i must say this visit really let me down. The lu rou was really tough and it didn\'t fall apart and melt in my mouth like it did the first time. Beef steak was also tough and a bit over medium rare. To make things worse, I found a PIECE OF PLASTIC (size of two rings) in my rice!!! Was great when it first opened but the quality dropped so much that it wouldn\'t warrant another visit.
ü¶ë\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Charred with a smokiness &amp; a house Glaze that adds a savoury flavour, but it\'s the kalamansi that brings the squid to another level. Good execution but portion wise, it was a tad disappointing. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />FIVE TEN, a month old newly opened eatery that has a Taiwanese Tapas Style concept which serves dishes at either üíµS$5 or üíµS$10.

The thought provoking idea of frying milk taunts one to order the dessert. Simply eaten alone will cause one to doubt the every reason you order it at the first place due to it being quite blend. But when you dip it in the Dulce de Leche, a whole new world of diabetes causing sugar rush opens for you. üçØ\n<br />.\n<br />Interesting idea, but after a couple of it does get boring. I\'d Order once to try, never again.

Do the calamansi squeeze... I insist. Squeeze here squeeze there, let it drip on my squid. It felt like burping a lime. The juice was so refreshing and tangy. Squid grilled till tender. Nice crisp charredness. The house glaze had a tinge of umaminess which harmonizes so well with the calamansi. So exhilarating good.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Truly enjoyed it and I know I will definitely go back for it. Best not to share cos it is so yummy.\n<br />Thank you @tiara_star for \"burping\" the limes and company is always fun.
It\'s an extreme experience. On one hand the tapas styled dishes were amazingly good (try the potatoes and ribs) but we waited 30mins for the food and I got a really stinky cup for water that obviously was not washed since the last person used it. I actually have never got a stinky cup in my life so I do think the hygiene standards at this place need to be relooked at. Furthermore a lot of items are sold out when we reached at 1230pm. Don\'t think I\'ll be back again though
Someone please stop me from popping by every day.
Rice bowls at $10 are so good! Steak, egg, rice and ru rou fan.

Yes.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />The concept of this cuisine is Taiwan inspired. Lu ruo fan or braised pork belly with sous vide egg and kailan over rice.

Kailan parboiled till soft and tasted kinda sweet. Now the homemade sauce was sweetilicious fragrant with hints of spices. How it was made and what goes in it, is a secret. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />My late mum used to cook this and eating this reminded me of her cooking style.
