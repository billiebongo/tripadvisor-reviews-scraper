I don\'t usually settle for pasta especially in cafes, but this dish had been consistently mentioned by friends so often I thought I might as well try it as a treat before entering the exam hall (oh excuses ...). Pasta was al-dente and the seafood was actually rather fresh especially the prawns — the pasta was laced in this Tom Yum sauce with bright, tangy flavours that dances on the tongue that is lightly spicy but very alluring. It\'s actually quite near perfection — if only the sauce is less watery and thicker in consistency so it laces around the strands of linguine better; would really agree to this dish in a heartbeat!
One of the better pulled pork I\'ve had in a long time, topped with crunchy strips of apple and add in two perfect poached eggs into the picture?! YAS!

Highly raved - Dish was $15 , topped with toast, cheese ((loads of cheese )) , tomatoes , avocado , poached eggs , and more!! Filling but quantity is quite small? (may be to some since I don\'t eat a lot 🙈 ) , worth a try ! Tasted good &amp; great for brunches/ breakfasts :))

How to say no to carbs if you see this? How?! Nvm I have saved up enough carbs \"points\" during the week so I\'m gg to \"redeem\" all of them here at Rise &amp; Grind! Hehe! I\'m glad I came here to spend my carbs points! The seafood pasta and carbonara taste so good! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Look at the fresh seafood, red red sauce over the linguine! OMG! You just got to try it for yourself. 😱 #noregretsforeatingcarbs #caloriesworthyfood #weekendindulgence #savemycarbsforthis #redseafoodpasta
Sunday brunch; it has been quite a while. 😂 Had my usual brunch comfort food: simple but so satisfying. There were lots of interesting and new items on their menu which I\'ll probably try the next time round. Cafe wasn\'t too big so the ambience felt cosy and homely. Tables were filled on a Sunday afternoon but we had no trouble getting a table indoors. Just a really chilled laid-back place for good food and service ☺️
With just one look and a sip, you can tell the baristas here take a lot of pride in their work. In fact, I couldn’t stop myself from having two cappuccinos - something I hardly ever do. They use beans sourced from Dutch Colony and Sarnies, and caffeine kick is guaranteed because they only do double shots. \n
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Of all that we were served at today, this wittily-named dish emerged top of my list.\n<br />Resting on smashed avocado and bread (sourced from Bread and Hearth), and accessorised with fresh baby spinach and grilled baby tomatoes were a pair of beautifully poached eggs. As though that\'s not wonderful enough, aromatic dukkah was sprinkled all over. (I\'ll save you the trouble of googling - \"dukkah\" is Egyptian of origin and comprises of coarsely-ground hard nuts with cumin and coriander). The slightly chewy triangles of haloumi cheese were a spot-on complement as they added a dash of saltiness to the rest of the milder tasting elements.\n<br />Karen, the co-owner of Rise &amp; Grind Coffee Co., shared that this dish is a really popular choice among their regulars, especially the health-conscious ones. Having tried it, I perfectly understand why.\n<br />Many thanks @riseandgrindco for your generous hospitality.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />P.S. This was my maiden visit to \"Rise &amp; Grind Coffee Co.\", so I only realised today it is situated in a cosy, standalone \"house\" detached from the main building of Bukit Timah Plaza. If you plan to visit, do take note. It is next to DBS but from the outside.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />A fusion style pasta that, in my opinion, nailed it.\n<br />Hitting that elusive point where East meets West appetisingly can be tricky but co-owner cum head chef Charles pulled it off with this Tom Yum Seafood Pasta. I like that he created the sauce to lean towards a dry-ish type of curry rather the thick, creamy sort. It\'s also fragrant and has a medium level of spiciness that should be acceptable to most people. For the price, there\'s a good amount of prawns, squid, mussels and mushrooms. What impressed me most though was hearing the other co-owner Karen say she actually goes to buy the seafood fresh from the wet markets in Bedok every couple of days. Now you know why this dish simply bursts with flavour.
What’s really unique about the RGC Honey Wings is the coating on them; I thought it resembles coarse biscuit crumbs. Which means the level of crunchiness was satisfyingly high every time I took a bite, even when some time had passed and the chicken had cooled down. The other thing that got my tastebuds all abuzzed was the mouthwatering combination of the spiciness of the coating, and the honey drizzled over. No wonder it\'s a hit amongst the drinkers who hang out at Rise &amp; Grind for their craft beer fix. \n<br />On a separate note, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how affordable the food is at Rise &amp; Grind Coffee Co. This is a good cafe in the Bukit Timah area to visit if you are on the hunt for meals that look and taste more expensive than they really are.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Sweet potato fries and mentaiko mayo aren\'t typically paired together but the result is a catchy combo.\n<br />I approve of this pink hued mayo as it packs a savoury-salty-fishy punch due to the plentiful mentaiko, making it a solid sparring partner with the natural sweetness in the starchy sweet potato.\n<br />Get this to share as it is substantial and can fill you up pretty quick.
Vanilla ice-cream comes as a choice, but then what\'s the fun if there is no ice-cream on a sticky date pudding? Flavour-wise this is much on the mark, providing flavours similar to sticky date pudding except texturally lighter and less sticky than the usual though as fibrous (it\'s initially made as a cake anyway). Probably the best alternative to Sticky Date Pudding if you are in the area.

It serves one of the best coffee around and offers interesting food items. Certainly worth your money!! Quickly head down to Rise &amp; Grind Coffee Co for an unforgettable cafe experience.
Fantastic cup of coffee priced at $5 for 5oz. It was amazing due to the lingering taste that is left even after finishing the coffee. The service was excellent because they served the coffee really quickly. The latte art was extremely interesting and a relaxed place to chill at.
and coffee. the problem is always choice - whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.
($17) I like the fact that they gave v generous amounts of smoked salmon 👍🏻👍🏻 worth my $$. But the poached eggs came quite rather cooked yolks which was disappointing and the sourdough toast were too hard and tough to cut through easily. Nonetheless the hollandaise sauce tasted just right, not too vinegary. I probably wouldn\'t be back anytime soon no idea why I thought of driving all the way there hahahah #burpple (i also like this dish cos it\'s named after a good film lol)

This dish combined the different ingredients well. I especially liked the combination of guacamole and the sausage. It made the sausage have a more unique flavour, and it acted as a dip for the bockwurst like how you usually do with ketchup! \n<br />Check out my full review in my blog. http://foodwithnic.wordpress.com
a twist of uniqueness yet contemporary
The addition of those cucumber matchsticks played a huge part in complementing a little fusion, almost reminding me of the Korean-style Jjajangmyeon, though I’m not totally sure if they’re going towards that direction. Would have preferred lower ratio of that apple cider, so as not to overpower those savoury flavours. Perhaps a little more salt to season those poached eggs too, but overall still a hugely decadent brunch unlike many other ordinary benedicts.\n<br />💕 Get 10% off total bill by entering  on the @Holler.Out App (iOS/Android)!

rise and shine with brunch at @riseandgrindco
Hei Amigo ($16): @riseandgrindco\'s take on Huevos Rancheros - Chorizo sausage, scrambled eggs, tortillas, cheddar cheese, wild mushrooms, Guacamole, tomato salsa and Greek yoghurt. I Guess I was bought over by the fact it includes scrambled eggs and guacamole 😊 \n<br />Interesting yet heavily flavourful dish, after reading all those ingredients, can\'t be too hard to imagine all those ingredients have a party in my mouth! Enjoyable dish yet wishing the portion was slightly heartier!
Always love a good neighborhood cafe that is easily accessible and serves healthy/hearty dishes. Ocean Thirteen ($17) made the usual eggs ben pale in comparison; yuzu hollandaise sauce (slight tangy but otherwise rich and buttery) and beet root yogurt (earthy, sweet) gave the dish a run for my money; runny eggs + smoked salmon + salmon roes on sour dough = party in my mouth 🎉 such vibrant/pretty dish! 
Was served this dish complimentary while being there to work on some school assignments. Quite an innovative take on sweet potato fries that actually worked quite well; crisp sweet potatoes that are naturally sweet and earthy that matches well with the umami flavour that Mentaiko is known for. My friend and I had meals prior to coming here, but we were enjoying it so much we just couldn\'t stop snacking on them that the mess tin was emptied in no time!
Earl Grey Malt Loaf served with a scoop of Vanilla ice-cream and salted caramel drizzled on the plate. Cake was moist and dense with raisin-like bits within, perfumed with Earl grey aroma that was prominent in every bite that u take into the cake, while the outer crust of the cake is covered with sweet malt. Don\'t think the salted caramel was necessary though since its quite sweet, but definitely would appease the sweet tooth. You can also opt for the cake without the ice-cream at $5.50.
Yesssss give me more of this, it was delish. Dense, not cloyingly sweet and there was always the occasional chunk of date which will make you swoon. I could\'ve had it with ice cream but I wanted something lighter so I didn\'t, but I WOULD TOTES go back to eat this with ice cream again. Wished the pecan wasn\'t soggy though, would\'ve like the crispy pecan. 
But nothing beats the one at @thelokalsingapore, of course.
Slow cooked pork shoulder was sufficiently moist, tender and sweet :) Apple cidar hollandaise gave a stark and refreshing contrast!
Sourdough toasts with cyprus haloumi, guacamole, dukkah, Greek yogurt and perfectly poached eggs 🍳
Because their tomyum seafood pasta with that generous helping of seafood would totally make me be an early riser,  and I\'ll be so ever willing to grind my teeth for pasta. Hehe!

One of the best Egg Benedicts I\'ve ever had. Pulled pork was really succulent, tender and flavourful. Eggs were poached perfectly. The apple cider hollandaise sauce gave a tart finish to the dish.

A hidden find tucked away just outside bukit timah plaza, this cafe featured interesting brunch items that were a refreshing change from the usual suspects. Fans of the superfruit would enjoy this avo-ka-dukkah which had hints of middle eastern spices. All dishes come with two generous runny poached eggs, so there\'s more than enough for everyone! 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Perfectly poached eggs 🍳. Hate it when brunch places don\'t get it right. The pulled pork shoulder and apple cider hollandaise, atop sourdough bread 🍞 was superb. 💯
The Tom Yum Sauce was so much creamier than expected, though it does carry a less than moderate punch. I’d say it’s definitely great for many who can’t take spiciness but always wanted to try this unconventional pasta, and those who do prefer some kick could probably ask to adjust for a more fiery flavour. The spaghetti itself was optimally al dente, and it’s awesome that it also absorbed a great deal of smacks despite the creaminess. Also love the simple but creative move to add those nori for a conceptually enhanced flavour. Wouldn’t say it’s the best Tom Yum pasta I’ve tried, but it sure is one plate of goodness that’s not just pretty on the outside.\n<br />✨ Get 10% off your total bill with minimum spending of $50 @RiseAndGrindCo - simply quote  on the @Holler.Out app!\n<br />#HollerOut
It looked so moist and fluffy in the fridge, but when eaten it was like the most average cake ever. It wasn\'t moist, yet wasn\'t dry, and it wasn\'t fluffy nor was it dense. Just very, very, very average. But the cream cheese frosting tasted like eating actual cheese, it wasn\'t like slightly sweet or anything - it tasted sour. Should have gotten something else instead, but I always give into buying carrot cakes because I love them so much argh!
The Sticky Date Loaf with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (S$10) was just wow. The cake was moist and flavourful, complemented with the rich, sweet caramel sauce drizzled all over it... and with the smooth vanilla bean ice cream... Nice. 👏
Aptly named the Hangover Cure, this dish is a perfect combination of everyone\'s favourite breakfast comfort food such as poached eggs, sausages and bacon. But if you\'re looking for a fun twist to some of your breakfast food, like Yuzu hollandaise sauce or Beetroot yogurt, this is the place you should check out.

Can\'t believe we met 3 times this week already and seeing you again on Monday haha.\n<br />_\n<br />#thefoodjournalist \n<br />_
Rise and shine for a hearty breakfast. Love the pull pork burger and eggs Benny. 
- classic seafood pasta tossed in spicy tomato sauce. The spicy sauce provided a slight tingle without ever straying too far from the sidewalk, whilst elsewhere the flaky cheese bits were nasally efficient but ultimately paper tigers. 3.4/5
Honey wings again, love it since the first time we had it. Ocean\'s Thirteen didn\'t quite work out for me while the Hei Amigo was pretty interesting. Till then, 2 hours to my paper 💪🏼
- chorizo sausage, scrambled eggs on tortillas, cheddar cheese, sautéed wild mushrooms, guacamole, tomato salsa, Greek yogurt and pickled onions.
First up, today it\'s Rise &amp; GrindCo. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n<br />The cafe is tucked away in a corner and it was rather small in size nevertheless, the ambience was rather nice. We got the outside seats due to full house indoors. Just remember that it will be rather humid if you\'re going to sit outside on a hot and sunny afternoon! We ordered the Tom Yum Seafood Pasta ($17) and the Nacho Libre Burger($16). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀The Tom Yum Seafood Pasta in my opinion is packed with a punch of flavor. Not only was the pasta al-dente, the sauce was adequate with a balance of sour, spice and creamy. The prawns and squids were nice but just a tad bit overcooked. Mussels was decent. I feel that this tom yum pasta was even better than 49 seats which supposingly claims to be one of the best? But my experience didn\'t tells me so.\n<br />Next up, the Nacho Libre Burger. It\'s a very interesting concept to put chips in a burger which gives a different texture to the burger itself. The salsa and guacamole was quite nice and not too overpowering. The chicken patty is grilled nicely without being too dry. All in all, this burger is quite unique, but I still felt that the Tom Yum Seafood Pasta top it off.\n<br />One critic only, we topped up extra $3 (I think) to change the fries to truffle fries. But it taste nothing close to truffle fries. So if you\'re going to dine there, just skip the truffle fries. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Do order their cold press juice! ($6.50) I believe they don\'t manufacture it but whoever did, it was a super refreshing drink for such a humid weather in S\'pore. \n<br />Do note that you have to make your way to the counter to have your order placed, and also self service with the cutleries and water. However, they do not charged any service charge or GST so why not? The prices are very affordable with the quality of the food they serve. Instagram: takemefeedme
gooey eggs, fresh avo, slightly redundant cheese and crisp bread. definitely worth it especially for the wonderful photo opportunity. 
I love brunches but I love them better when it\'s prices reasonably. Here U get a hearty serving of brunch between $12-$18! The croissant is so buttery n perfectly toasted. The conquistador has a nice Spanish flavours to it. Yummy.  Great start to my day.  
Let\'s sit back, relax and have a cuppa. Single origin kenya beans was executed perfectly with an exceptional berries notes lingering, high acidity with substantial body to give me the caffeine kick! Mega 💗💓💕💖💞 P.S: Single origin kenya beans is one of my fav coffee beans so I am happy to drink a good cuppa😍😍😍 For peeps who wanna try kenya beans here, there is limited quantity.☕☕☕
is ok to start the day spicy - seafood tom yum pasta. if only my burst of ulcers aint there to spoil my enjoyment of this burst of flavors
i dont need a hangover to have a perfect breakfast ($18) - simply love the avocado spread by the side. best with the mushrooms and brioche toast.
my coffee was slightly let down but gosh is the food good here!
Dukkah is used in this dish which we usually don\'t see it in brunch menu. It has this kind of Middle East taste of peppery spice in it which you either like it or hate it. Not the usual kind of brunch that you normally had.
In an ideal world, perfect circles exist. Perfect circles in perfect circles in perfect circles in perfect squares.
I can forgive the crowd, since Rise &amp; Grind appears to be the newest (and nearest) hangout for nearby Ngee Ann Poly and SIM students. But service was distinctly bad on both my visits. My Thai milk tea loaf took nearly 15 mins for staff to cut and plate despite it literally sitting out on the display cabinet of cakes. Several staff members also cast me withering looks when I stayed past an hour after ordering only a coffee and cake, making me feel distinctly unwelcome. The Long Black was a decent, strong cup of coffee, although my previous experience with a powdery and gritty Chai Latte lowered the expectations. The Waffle wasn\'t too bad for $10 and is a good snack to be shared between two. 
Other than side dishes and desserts, they serve pretty good brunch too! Aren\'t you tempted already?
What weekends should be made of: hearty comfort food and lots of bright colours.
Finally had some time to have brunch at rise and grind. I wasn\'t sure what I want to have but I finally decided with the avo-ka-dukkah. Boy, I was in for a surprise. It was so delicious. The cheese, the avocado and the delicious poached eggs was a super yummy combination. Then again, I think I love anything avocado these days. Coffee here is pretty good too.!
Honey wings ($9); Truffle fries ($9); Vanilla ice-cream ($3/scoop). It\'s really a nice place to chill especially since it\'s so near to Ngee Ann Poly! The truffle fries was not bad and they actually added a lot more parmesan for us when we asked for more. The wings are more of a sweet and sour taste, unlike Lola\'s, and for that I think it\'s quite unique. Oh and I super duper love their vanilla ice-cream😍 You can spot the vanilla beans and it just tastes SO GOOD😋
Supplied by Lavanille Patisserie which is an online bakery, the Lemon Meringue Tart is decent here. While the curd is tart enough, the meringue could be beaten more to make it more smooth as it was a bit clumpy in certain parts. Tart base could be thinner and more crisp too. Not too bad overall though.
The Gold Standard ($18) - a beautiful burger with an amalgamation of wonderful ingredients. A juicy beef patty, streaky bacon, melted cheddar cheese, garlic and chive aioli, fresh arugula leaves all in between a beautiful toasted brioche bun. \n<br />The burger is a joy to eat as the patty is nicely seared and cooked through while the aioli makes each bite, a yummy one. The burger also comes with a good portion of fries (+$1 for truffle fries). The establishment is quaint and service, though great, can be slow during peak hours. We will definitely be back to try out their brunch menu and coffees.
This was conveniently located nearby Ngee Ann Polytechnic! It\'s a good hangout place for people to chill and relax. I would say that the carbonara ($14)  was just okay and the 63 degree egg didn\'t flow well. However, the Tom Yum Seafood pasta ($17)  was superb! 👍🏻 They were pretty generous with their pawns and the servicing was just nice too! (: I would like it better if the sauce was spicier. The truffle fries ($9) was not too bad though it wasn\'t the best that I\'ve eaten. Service was good. ☺️
Seems like there\'s a battle going on (truffle leek + mushroom ragout &amp; chorizo) competing for my attention in my mouth. The salty chorizo goes really well with the romesco sauce but the chorizo was kinda salty that it was overpowering the whole dish. On the other hand, absolutely loving the mixture of the truffle infused leek &amp; mushroom ragout that blend in well with the poached eggs on the buttery toasts. Can I have more of that pls?
The  tom yum pasta was awesome, something different. Definitely worth the travel, staff were friendly too!! Food 4.5/5
Guacamole, grilled cheese, Greek yogurt and poached eggs on toast, $15. Sometimes it\'s refreshing to go to a brunch place where you find interesting items on the menu instead of the usual suspects. Only gripe was that the cafe was way too cramped and crowded. #coffee #cafeculture
In my opinion, the creamy tom yam sauce really sealed the case for me. Creamy start yet a fiery slight sweat spiciness at the end. Superb finishing of generous seafood! So good, I almost couldn\'t stop myself ordering another plate!
at first smell, the truffle didn\'t stand out like the way truffled fries were, which usually send the strong truffle smell across the place. but at first bite, the truffle oil was evenly infused into the leek &amp; mushroom! everything blends in well with the poached eggs and toast. the leek was cut finely so even a non-leek lover like me enjoyed the combination with the rest. \n<br />since it is a Spanish theme, they incorporated romesco sauce and chorizo. the nut and red pepper-based sauce helped to balance the overall taste, but the chorizo overpowered the rest. kinda salty and as what I shared with them, both chorizo and truffled leek + mushroom were fighting for my taste bud\'s attention.\n<br />nevertheless, they were really patient in hearing our feedback and explained the idea behind the dish. R&amp;D is always exciting, so I look forward to seeing refinements and new dishes. thanks for having us!
Located just outside Bukit Timah Plaza, it only starts serving brunch food from 10am onwards😅 went so early I had to wait. But as it was father\'s day, the place was already filled before 10am. Dads were offered a free cup of latte on this day too 😊 Food was good! Though despite the rave, I couldn\'t really taste that unique yuzu sauce for my egg benz (Ocean Thirteen) But it was still not bad. Items featured in the picture include: Ocean Thirteen $17/The Conquistador $19/BYOB with so many items it amounted to $21. Verdict: Love the food here. Surprisingly, the BYOB breakfast platter is more appetising to me. Imo, it\'s better than most mediocre egg benz and breakfast food out there! 4.30/5.0.
The playfully sour guacamole had a texture so smooth that one could mistake it for a very nutritious face-cream, while the dukkah brought an exotic peppery spice to the proceedings. Definitely go for the addition of bacon, since I’m not sure the basic dish would satiate one’s weekend brunch craves. 3.7/5 
– chorizo, poached eggs on toast, truffled leek &amp; mushroom ragout, romesco sauce and arugula. Ignore the emotional blackmail from the conqueror and his (unintentional?) :X sad-face – he is probably just pouting that you will ruin the visually arresting aesthetic once you dig in. The poached eggs – all pretty with their weekend make-up on – were perfect and eggporned very professionally, while the (ahem) salty and super meaty conqueror swords went well with the tomato-sour romesco sauce. The heirloom baby peppers and pumpkin seeds provided crunch and the mushroom ragout brought some moisture to the yard, while the toast performed its servantly function as ragout bed with diligence. 3.8/5 
Love the crispy, crunchy, greaseless exterior with tangy sauce over it. Amazingly moist and delicious on the inside too! It will be great if is coated with more sauce or to dip with. Can anyone pls travel there to buy for me? Hehe! 😋😋😋
Carb-loving with my two favourite carbs – potatoes and pasta. The tom yum sauce here is dope.
This umami-filled seafood pasta is creamy, tangy &amp; a lil\' spicy. Could be spicier thou\'!
Love the colours and the plating, but the flavours disappointed. Couldn\'t understand which direction they were heading with the mentaiko, beet yogurt, and asparagus. Imagine lots of acidity, random bursts of salty fishiness, and the odd neutral crunch. The flavours clashed a little and my tastebuds was reeeeeally confused.
Wanted the Tom Yum pasta but they were sold out ): This was a little dry for me even with the egg, but I liked the addition of the Sakura Ebi for the crunch! Slightly salty overall though. 
Rise and shine with this mushroom and bacon spaghetti with the spread of half boiled egg
I\'ve ice latte and ice mocha for today lunchie munchie.
Lazy Sundays call for idyllic brunch sessions. @alainlicious and @missusalain didn\'t think the egg dishes here were that fab, but perhaps I\'m easier to please – I thought they were quite affordable and not at all shabby in terms of taste and presentation! The cafe is a 10min walk from the boyfriend\'s place, so I\'ll certainly be back again.
#Brunch with my fave peeps.
I have had overrated interpretations of this dish elsewhere which left me cold, but here my breath (and all sensation in the lips) were taken away rapidly. The creamy tom yum sauce itself was positively exploding with seafood flavour, yet at the same time possessed a wicked spiciness that sears and numbs your smackers…and I loved every second of it. Phwoar. 4.2/5
Brunch earlier at a new find! Heard much of this place &amp; decided to give it a try! So I decided to go for the Shakshouka, which is a Mediterranean dish with Lamb Sausages, Feta Cheese, sous vide egg &amp; tomato base. It went well with the whole grain pita but could do more with more pita! As for the Chilli Crab Pasta, it was one of the top hits &amp; I must say it\'s a pretty decent portion for the price! Though a tad dry, the amount of crab meat was good!   
Using their House Blend, Rise &amp; Grind\'s house blend is pretty smooth with a milk chocolate finish. Couldn\'t really taste the apple custard, but pretty easy to drink. 
Does the splash of beetroot yoghurt add anything to the dish?\n<br />No.
Unlike most cafés who does their wings only with Honey, Rise &amp; Grind comes with their own variation by incorporating spiciness into their wings. The result was crispy wings that were not only juicy to bite with enough meat stuck to the bone, but the accompanying thick and sticky sauce has a sweet and spicy tang that was pretty near Korean Fried Chicken. A must order. 
Despite having a light truffle flavour that can go off the radar at times, there was a generous amount of shaved Parmesan sitting atop the crisp fries which made them rather savoury. Not the best truffle fries around, but considered above average for those served in a cafe.
– smoked salmon, poached eggs, asparagus, brioche toast, beetroot yogurt and yuzu hollandaise sauce. Magnificent presentation, with the bold splash of beetroot yogurt adding so much drama to the plate that a wavy-haired nymphet with mascara tears who is on a phone with her bestie about i. feeling fat and unloved, ii. how he said “I still love you” and it is exhausting, you know, and they would never get back together like ever and iii. being exposed for buying likes on Instagram (these likers have zero posts, tens of friends and several thousand “following”) would lose to the Ocean’s Thirteen in a competition for Most Drama. The brioche toast was lovely – soft, buttery and moist. However, the egg yolk was probably not finished with hair and makeup before premiering on stage as it turned up rather coagulated, and the overall portion was rather meagre – one could buy a clump of salmon gravalax for the price of this exquisite creature. The salmon itself was aggressive in attention-whoring with its saltiness, stealing shine from the more nuanced charms of the yuzu hollandaise, beetroot slices and beetroot yogurt itself, so do savour these individual components and give them some love and appreciation before going for big Salm. 3.6/5 
Ocean\'s Thirteen (SGD $17) - Perfectly poached egg with oozing liquid yolk that runs over the smoked salmon on the crusty brioche toast at the prick of a tine, with a generous glaze of yuzu hollandaise sauce over it. Beetroot suace was splashed across the side that make the whole dish more appealing and pretty. Everything was good but If the yuzu taste in hollandaise sauce can come out abit more stronger, it will be even better.
Let\'s spice things up a little by having some Tom Yum Seafood Pasta ($16). Totally legit stuff here that I hope there\'s some bread to go along with it so that you can dip it in the sauce and clean the plate dry after finishing the pasta. Strong lemongrass aroma with a mild hit of spiciness (like how a Pikachu would shock you), paired with fresh seafood catch.
Joining the eateries in Bukit Timah Plaza\'s new extension, Rise &amp; Grind Coffee Co. offers both indoor and alfresco seating and serves coffee, brunch fare and a small selection of mains. With few cafes in this area, this is certainly a welcome addition. For brunch, go for the super photogenic and delightfully tasty Ocean\'s Thirteen ($17) — smoked salmon, poached eggs, asparagus, brioche toast, beetroot yogurt and yuzu hollandaise sauce. Massive trending points for having both beetroot and yuzu in one dish, and making it work well too! For lunch or dinner, go for the more substantial Shakshouka ($16) — lamb merguez sausage, baked egg in tomato sauce, feta cheese with wholemeal pita — or the Tom Yum Pasta ($16).
Really craving for this Tom Yum Seafood Pasta I had the other day with @juliuslim.
It\'s finally the weekends! Let\'s spice things up a little by having some Tom Yum Seafood Pasta ($16). Totally legit stuff here that I hope there\'s some bread to go along with it so that you can dip it in the sauce and clean the plate dry after finishing the pasta. Strong lemongrass aroma with a mild hit of spiciness (like how a Pikachu would shock you), paired with fresh seafood catch.
Ocean\'s Thirteen ($17) from Rise and Grind is like an art masterpiece with smoked salmon, poached eggs, asparagus, brioche toast, beetroot yogurt and yuzu hollandaise sauce. It\'s so pretty that you can\'t bear to eat it. However, it\'s slightly pricier (for its small portion) due to the quality of ingredients used.
The RGC Honey Wings ($9) looks so tempting for an otherwise dull morning. The tangy sauce that is slathered onto the crispy chicken gives it a certain life, texture and colour. I would wish for more sauce to dip!
Trying out the dinner menu featuring Tom yum pasta &amp; Shakshouka $16 each; pretty good!
[Shakshouka S$16] - lamb merguez sausage, baked egg in tomato sauce, feta cheese with wholemeal pita.
Beginning of the long weekend and MAY everyone have a great time chilling wherever you are. Presenting to you the Lamb Shakshuka from Rise &amp; Grind, a perfect sunrise for the egg lovers.
This small cafe tucked beside Bukit Timah Plaza did not disappoint when I casually dropped for a meal with some army friends today.
Just waffles 🍧🍧with vanilla ice cream &amp; caramel sauce. Warm &amp; crispy....i like😄😄 thanks to karen @riseandgrindco for preparing half a waffle (which was not in the menu) for me. Love it &amp; great warm friendly service. Well worth the trip🚃🚄🚖 #waffles #icecream #dessertlovers #dessert #openrice #burpple #bestfoods
Ocean\'s Thirteen is Rise &amp; Grind\'s version of the Eggs Benedict, which comes with two poached eggs atop Brioche toast, with beetroot and beetroot yogurt, asparagus and a Yuzu Hollandaise sauce. Eggs were flowy when poked, and the smoked salmon was savoury with cured flavours that was bursting with freshness. Brioche bun was light and fluffy, coming with a tinge of sweetness while the asparagus and beetroot gives a crunch. Hidden underneath are fish roes that burst with umamI goodness. A well put together dish that starts the day right.
The ongoing promotion offers a dessert for free for patrons who brings along a friend, and we were served a halved version of their waffles. Vanilla bean ice-cream was smooth and creamy, as well as aromatic with strong vanilla aroma, but the waffle despite its crispness on the exterior was actually rather dry inside. Salted Caramel sauce was intensive in flavour but the amount given was sufficient and did not overpower the entire dish. There are also other choices for ice-cream such as chocolate and coconut as well.
.\n<br />|\n<br />The herb lamb sausage infused into the tomato based sauce! The semi egg added another layer of creaminess which made it very suitable to dip it with the wholemeal Pita. So Good!
Don\'t forget to make your day shine at this new cafe, \"Rise &amp; Grind Coffee Co.\" newly opened at Bukit Timah Plaza just today!

[Truffled Carbonara] was not bad -- the truffle flavor was pretty robust, although the cream sauce was a little too rich for my liking. [Chilli Crab Pasta] was much better, although we didn\'t manage to get a good picture of it.

The truffle carbonara with bacon, mushroom and onsen egg! Carbonara always my fave kinda of pasta. This one is good! Going to be back here whenever I have a carbonara kick. 😋 #savemycarbsforthis #weekendindulgence #caloriesworthyfood #noregretsforeatingcarbs
Thick and well-seasoned, the beef patty of this burger falls into the tightly-packed category, which means it\'s pretty firm to the bite. Minimal but impactful toppings of a slice of perfectly-melted cheese and a couple of rocket leaves enhance the taste of it. With the little bucket of evenly-salted skinny fries tagging along, getting this burger means you\'re in for a filling and satisfying meal.

It is way more stimulating than any salted egg yolk pasta. The sauce, fragrant with lime leaves, lemongrass, clings onto the spaghetti nicely. It is a little spicy, with creaminess rounding out the tangy edges. What gives the sauce its depth of flavour, which I found out later, is the shrimps stock which they have prepared by cooking the prawn shells for hours before reducing it to a flavourful base. No shortcuts. The prawns were succulent and squids were chewy, and its vibrant orange red makes this dish ever more appetising. Not to forget the stems of parsley that adds a great touch to the flavour. The nori does little to the taste, but it reflects the culinary background of Chef Charles, the soul behind kitchen, who is French trained but with strong Japanese influence. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #tomyum #pasta #riseandgrind

Although this is not exactly something new, but they did it the right manner. The pork shoulders is slowed cook overnight for 24 hours, cooking and soaking in its own flavours and lard, like a confit. It\'s not at all greasy, trust me. Combined with perfectly poached eggs, I\'m quite certain that this will win the hearts of men who always see egg benedict as more of a light snack. I thought my added sautéed mushrooms was pretty tasty too, with a hint of wine along with its earthy taste. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #pulledpork #egg #breakfast #brunch #riseandgrind

Review on their new menu up on explodingbelly.com! Link up in bio!
Always love the food here not forgetting the large portion too!
Cussing under my breathe at the numerous pop-ups that have proven to be empty vessels financed by carbon copied concepts, brilliant decor and not so outstanding fare that leaves a burrow in your wallet whilst digging deep for reasons to make a return visit. Thankfully, Rise and Grind Co falls out of that category, settling in a particularly fond nook and cranny of my heart\n<br />♡♡♡\n<br />Keep a look out for their NEW menu items such as this {Pulled Pork Burger} which I reckon would be even better in the benedict form!

|| Pulled pork was succulent with a slight caramelized sweet facade and none of that stringy dried nonsense. Good ole\' coleslaw completes the eqn with the oddballish dense bagel like consistency to the bun working to its advantage since it possesses a firewall like quality to the onslaught of the juices. •\n<br />The best part of brunch; my 3oz single origin El Salvador piccolo latte.

So shiok to down four poached eggs at one go. 😍😘 #SgCafe #Flatlay #Eggs  #Brunch #CafeHoppingSg #ExSgCafes #Coffee #EileenWantsToCampHere #Burpple #RiseAndGrindCo
Light and fluffy waffles with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and salted caramel sauce drizzled at the side. Sadly, the chocolate ice cream tasted pretty bland as it lacked the richness of the chocolate affecting the overall waffle experience 😖 #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsiders

Got that strong but not metallic #matcha taste. Slightly on the sweeter side.
The jams are quite standard, although the eggs can be more runny (maybe because I took so long to take the pictures. Lol). Overall, is quite good.
Looking forward to our little getaway soon!
Meanwhile, I\'ve got a lot on my plate. Literally... With the {Ocean\'s Thirteen} from @riseandgrindco || Smoked Salmon, poached eggs, asparagus, beetroot yogurt and Yuzu hollandaise sauce - somehow this dish feels a little different sans the pretty grey dishes the kitchen used to plate it on。
A bit on the tart side with astringent notes of unripened blueberries - get the black version to be safe。
Can anyone pls travel down to buy for me? 😁😁😁 Love the crispy, crunchy, greaseless exterior with tangy sauce over it. Amazingly moist and delicious on the inside too!
Well poached eggs on top of savory bread slices with leeks and cabbage, not forgetting the gourmet sausage with rocket leaves and cranberries, pumpkin seeds and capsicums as garnish. Bacon and cheese fries to end off the fantastic meal which leave a lingering fragrance in my mouth. #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #cafefood #foodporn #foodhunter #instafood #cafe #foodlover #foodpic #hungry #food #sgfoodiary #foodie #burpple #tinlicious #foodpandasg #foodgasm #cafekakisg #cafebunnysg #sgcafefood #dinner #poached #egg #leeks #cabbage #sausage #salad #cranberry  #burpple

Bonus is there\'s bacon too! 😉
But not spicy leh... 😜

😋
|| Well, to be perfectly honest, the patties were excellent, being heavily seasoned with a hearty texture. Bacon was spot on with that melted cheddar cheese cascading seductively down the sides. The only downside - that bun which had a slight nostalgic artificial flavor to it. Darn... All good things have to come to an end。

A scene of an epic battle foretold with foraged ingredients cooked to perfection (apart from my poached eggs which appeared to be a tad waterlogged that morning). My favourite part, the earthly bed of truffled leek and mushroom ragout that adhered so endearingly to the buttered toast... Give me more please。
{The Conquistador} and {Shashouka} reporting for duty！
Crispy &amp; juicy! 😉
😄
Perhaps one of the better ones out there with the balance. The strong espresso shot here was able to make it stand out from the scoop of vanilla ice-cream which was rich and speckled with lots of vanilla beans. When the ice-cream melts, it turns into a creamy concoction where vanilla gets spiked with caffeine.
This is one \'clean\' dish to revel in, the combination of flavors, brilliant and almost enlightening on the palette。
No Kidding！

Quite a unique drink which made in New Zealand. Name as Gingerrella. Refreshing drink.
Brunch. Ocean\'s thirteen. \n<br />The yuzu hollandaise with the ikura brings a zesty flavour to the poached eggs. The soft brioche goes well with the beetroot yogurt at the side. Something unique. \n<br />Especially to students from Ngee Ann Poly and SIM, this is just 5-10mins away.

The tangy sauce that is slathered onto the crispy chicken gives it a certain life, texture and colour. I would wish for more sauce to dip!
Yet another delightful find in the West, somewhere I hardly set foot in unless to eat. 
Time is passing by too fast 😎
Lamb sausages thrown together in the same pan as baked eggs in tomato sauce, with feta cheese served with wholemeal pita at the side, the dish was rather wholesome as the tangy tomato sauce was served with extra tomato purée and cubes within for more punch, while the baked egg was runny and flowed so as to be smothered atop the wholemeal pita. Also loved how the inclusive of lamb sausages did not cause the entire dish to become too gamey, which makes it a really delightful breakfast plate to have alone or to share.
