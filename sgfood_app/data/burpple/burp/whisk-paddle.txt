Surprised at how much we enjoyed the food here! Was really glad that they served \"lunch\" items starting in the morning because it gave us more variety to choose from. Rave reviews of the Mac &amp; Cheese ($13.80) proved to be legit. Simple, but so heartwarming! The Vongole Linguine ($17.80) came with a really generous serving of fresh clams and was tasty with the classic combination of white wine, garlic and chili padi. Just had to sneak in my Matcha &amp; Rose Latte ($6.50) because it was sooooo good. Both the flavours of Matcha and rose shone in the drink, in perfect harmony with each other. Definitely recommend this over the Matcha &amp; Choco Latte ($6.50), which failed to achieve the same balance as the latter was too overpowering. Now won\'t you take me back to that long weekend.... #burpple #macncheese #matcha
It\'s not on the menu, but they do serve this for $3 upon request. Thoroughly enjoyed this with a cup of coffee at such chill and relaxing place!

Not an unforgettable dessert, but it wasn\'t bad. While I thought the elements of the dish could have been better executed (grapes made for quite a peculiar topping, and I was hoping for a more decadent cheesecake), waffles were decently fluffy and the berry compote was on point!
It\'s like when you are already in the midst of the day and you feel like having a hearty brunch. Whisk &amp; Paddle turns out to be a pleasant retreat for me, as the restaurant faces a dense forest at the opposite side of the river.
I had a plate of waffles that came accompanied with scrambled eggs and bacon. The bacon was yums! The place was filled with lots of families with kids as there was a mini play area for children to roam around freely.
Dinner after a walk to Coney Island and back. Nice view overlooking the park with many cyclists, joggers and families. Chose the Mesclun salad as I\'m trying to eat healthy. Portion wise A little towards to the small side, but the salsa sauce and pomegranate in the salad is yummy! 
Finally came to try out this popular cafe @whiskandpaddlesg ! Was holding back for quite awhile due to countless bad reviews regarding service &amp; overpriced food. But decided i just want to relax, not for any good food &amp; was plesantly surprised 😃
🍌\n<br />•\n<br />The combination of pudding and waffles was somewhat perplexing; felt like haphazard, mismatched pieces in this dessert. Moreover, the vanilla ice cream from Mövenpick wasn\'t that great either.\n<br />•\n<br />Overall, we weren\'t too fond of their sweet offerings but the service was definitely excellent. 😊👍🏻
Oriental Wings – deep fried chicken wings. The wings were well marinated and very fragrant when served. You’ll first bite into the crispy skin before sinking your teeth into its tender, juicy meat. 
🍴 Dish: French Toast With French Butter &amp; Syrup ADD ON Bacon &amp; Scrambled Eggs \n<br />💸 Price: 15.8
🍴 Dish: Half Butter Waffle With Single Scoop \n<br />🍦 Ice Cream Flavor: Maple Walnut \n<br />💸 Price: 9.8
Went out for a Sunday outing and found this lovely place... Cinnamon and iced coffee... Just makes it all the sweeter for a chill out Sunday
My bf rated it 6.5/10 because he had better but said he would return again as the service was good and the ambiance was very relaxing. I agreed with him! I like how cool it was to sit outdoor thanks to the fans, so we could soak up the view while we eat too.
We waited close to 40 minutes for our mains but that aside rather impressive cafe/western food fare here. \n<br />My Egg Benedict Waffle was pleasantly airy accompanied by some benchmark runny poach eggs and savory smoked salmon. \n<br />The highlight had to be the desserts though with a tangy Passionfruit tart that had a macaron that would impress amateur fans of the French dessert (i.e me) with its brittle shell and rich filling.\n<br />Had a small bite of the Cha Yen Krup (since we were sharing desserts), and it was great! Don\'t think anything with movenpick ice cream could go direly wrong 😛
Macaroni, honey-baked ham and onion cooked on pink sauce and mozzarella cheese
Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon on waffles @ $13. Light and fluffy waffles was a great compliment to the savoury eggs benedict. 
Happy Friday everyone! I\'m gonna start my weekend with an amazing Thai Milk Tea parfait from Whisk and Paddle! Absolutely adore this pretty thing. The Cha Yen Krup ($9.80) is the BOMB! A scoop of MOVENPICK vanilla ice cream sits on a crumbly base of graham cookies and Thai Milk Tea cream before being topped with two golden sticks of sugared butter toast and a giant macroon. They excel at baking here so what really stands out are the two sugared butter sticks, crisp and sweet on the edges, soft and fluffy on the inside, perfect accompaniment to the ice cream. I do wish the Thai milk tea was a little stronger in flavour, it\'s rather mild, an under current of it swimming under the sweet ice cream and graham cookies. The gold dusted macaroon a delight, just the right consistency, and not too heavy that it ruins the balance of the dish. @whiskandpaddlesg #thaimilktea #parfait
With sides of mushrooms and maple syrup. One of the best waffles I\'ve had - crisp on the outside, buttery &amp; fragrant. Scrambled eggs were great too! Plus points for a location that makes you feel you\'ve stepped out of Singapore, if only for a little while.
Moist, eggy, savoury sweet French toast that is easily the best in SG 😘 despite its ulu location at the far north, you will be rewarded with the refreshing laid-back setting on a backdrop of luscious nature as offered by the Punggol waterway. There\'s a play area for kids too. Great place for a family weekend :)
Definitely a place to chill because it is near the end of Punggol. Where you either drive, cycle or take the LRT from Punggol MRT station. Pretty accessible because many go there to cycle during the weekends or evening. Nice place to chill as it is quite windy in that area. Did I mention that their prawns are Tiger Prawns?? Which means more flesh, sweeter and tastier!! Price is slightly higher but why not?!? Great latte art I must say! Give it a try! 👍🏻👌🏻
One of the best Hawaiian pizza I had...and nacho too, nestled in a nice ambience beside the river.
Fancy some french toast heavily sweetened with honey and egg mix? Whisk &amp; Paddle definitely has one of the better French toast in town, it\'s sweet, eggy with a little crisp! 
Mac and cheese is really the bomb here! Must try! And the chicken wings! Not the best but still worth thumbs up! Cons: lots of flies around. I recommend sitting inside even tho outside you will have bands singing
I had the smoked salmon Eggs Benedict. They ran out of asparagus and replaced it with a side of salad. Shared a side of sauteed mushrooms and topped the meal off with a cup of flat white ☕
☺️ Esp when it\'s a treat 😏 (keedding 😘) So we cycle to eat and eat to cycle, on repeat 🙌🏼😂🚴🏻🍴🙆🏻 #burpple
finally dropped by Whisk &amp; Paddle for a Good Friday brunch! i had the Macaroni &amp; Cheese ($13.80), which tasted great till the last bit. it was cooked in pink sauce, which made it not \"gelat\" and did not make me feel full. portion size was just right as well. and of course their signature presentation of the mac &amp; cheese makes it so unique! i loved the open concept of the cafe, and even though we were sitting outside it was still cool! waiting time however should be improved though. \n<br />in this picture also includes the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($13) and Bolognese ($15.80).
Cha Yen Krup from @whiskandpaddlesg \n<br />Thai tea party cream, Thai tea macaroon and super yummz butter sugar toast with Mövenpick vanilla Icecream! Based is filled with  butter cake, graham crumbs and toasted almond flakes! 
Mac n Cheese and French toast were well received! French toast was fluffy and was lovely accompanied by the scrambled egg. Surprisingly,  I didn\'t find this version of Mac n Cheese overly gelat:) 
I love the ideal of waffle instead of English muffins or bread since i am a waffle lover... but... the poached egg and hollandaise sauce lacks flavour. The sauce and egg taste plain, tasteless even though it is creamy... hope they will improve their sauce and drain the poached egg better.. next time will try their big breakfast instead...
The Tropical Brûlée ($13.80) - chocolate waffles &amp; vanilla ice cream (a combi that can never go wrong), accompanied with a delicious banana brûlée and a crème caramel topped with almond flakes &amp; chocolate sauce. Personally felt that the caramalised banana wasn\'t that great, but everything else on the plate was not only great but beautifully presented.
Nice ambience. Good for chillax.
Food is not bad but feels a tad too pricey, and considering the price, it just leaves much to be desired. For this dish, tastes alright but the freshness &amp; quantity of the prawns is slightly disappointing.
The temperature difference between the toasty warm and icy cold elements was intriguingly diverting, while elsewhere the gentle vanilla ice cream soothed the raging angst of the heavily Thai tea cream and the chocolatey Thai tea macaron was undergoing a severe identity crisis. 3.3/5
But if you\'re planning to drop by Punggol area for activities, Whisk &amp; Paddle is a cafe you can chill out.
Crabmeat linguine was not bad, rather big portion for a lady. 
The food will play an important role when you cafe-hop but I feel that it is the one who is sitting opposite you which is the most important Do you agree? Be thankful for all those who take the time off to have a meal with you!😌
I simply need 2 eggs in the morning to kick-start my engine!😁
Focus not the most on point! Looks like I haven\'t mastered the holding-a-fork-with-one-hand-and-taking-a-picture-with-the-other. Lol. #macandcheese #foodphotography #foodpic
@whiskandpaddlesg\n<br />This is literally all day #breakfast, cause it was ordered for dinner LOL. 😛\n<br />Costs $13++, could have at least given a full waffle. The waffle was also very dense and doughy, it could have been better. \n<br />2 eggs with hollandaise, some smoked salmon, 4 sticks of asparagus and half a dense waffle. Is it worth it? You be your own judge. I guess there will always be die-hard breakfast fans around. \n<br />#waffles #eggs #burpple
Carbonara vs Mushroom Aglio Olio. \n<br />After a chill afternoon at Whisk Cafe. I end up at another Whisk. @whiskandpaddlesg\n<br />Carbonara was served with a runny egg bomb waiting to be 🔪. Sauce turned out to be just the right creamy texture. \n<br />Ho, mush aglio was a surprise for me. It tasted different from the usual you would expect from restaurants. This I recommend, and shall not spoil it for y\'all. 👍\n<br />#pasta #burpple #carbonara #aglioolio
[Today\'s Menu]: Mushroom Aglio Olio ($13.80) &amp; Carbonara ($15.80). Freshly shaved slices of Parmesan cheese with a kick of spiciness for the Aglio Olio. Mushroom taste is a bit strong but I think that it\'s just nice for me. Beware of the oozing egg! Alleviates perfectly the creaminess of the sauce.\n<br />We went to whisk &amp; paddle thinking that if the pasta were nice, the other mains in the menu would be decent too. Unfortunately, the other food in the dinner menu did not work for me. Undercooked and sub-partial standard. We ordered Fish &amp; Chips ($25) and Gnocchi ($26). Fish and Chips were disappointed dry and the batter was doughy. Gnocchi were nowhere near of being a gnocchi. It looked more like balls of pasta dough being press flat in the middle. Duck was rare and we had to request for a second cooking. Ambience was nice as it was situated next to a park with smell of fresh greenery. I believe there are live bands on the weekend too. But other than that, I might have to think twice before coming back.
Had this pretty #passionfruittart. Filling was good but crust was a little too hard. Not bad for $6.50 though.
Eggs Benedict is a dish that works very well with waffles; I don\'t know why people still bother with muffins! Would eat again.
Moist sponge cake with smooth velvety chocolate. Indulge in this and detox with a pot of tea later using @sugar_singapore !
Rather enjoyable, though the portion was really small given the price…
While the combination of lychee and duck sounds exotic, it tasted not-too-bad. But the pizza could use a little more grilling as the crust tasted quite \'raw\'. Lotus roots chips with truffle mayo was no doubt addictive, but it could be better improved if they dap off some oil from the chips.
Overpriced food, waffle is hard and not cripsy. Food is way below average. Not recommended at all. Big disappointment. Long waiting time for food - took 40 minutes. Drinks were not served first and got drinks after 25 mins after ordering.
Don\'t go humpin\' your back out! Mid way through the week so SMILE! ~ Unknown
Atmosphere is more to family oriented cafe theme along the park connector. Food wise is 5/10 to me.
At $3.50, this was better than their food but the lemony taste overpowered any flavour of earl grey. 
Photogenic food, but hits and misses. Mac &amp; cheese a little gelat towards the end, but it was quite tasty. Eggs Ben served on waffles was an absolute disappointment, it was bland. The honey baked ham was chunky, but also tasteless. At least waffles were pretty well done.
Sauce felt empty and lacked flavor. Goes well with a cider. Almost anything does. 
Dessert Waffle: With bananas &amp; walnuts, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top ($15.8++)
Mushroom Aglio Olio ($12.0++)
Eggs Benedict with Honey Baked Ham on a Waffle ($13.0++) 
Pleasantly surprised by how good the waffles here are. Not even the moisture from all those toppings seeping through the crisp exterior of the waffle could take away from the fact that it tasted 💋👌 .
Food wise is ok but really the service sucks (waited for my food for at least 30mins as they missed our order) when I queried they went to check and never get back to me. Kinda of pissed off. 
Mediocre eggs on waffles / Hollandaise sauce was a whole disapppointment. It wasn\'t just bland, it was tasteless :( The waiting time was atrocious, TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE 1HOUR WAIT AT ALL. 
a different take to the eggs ben. instead of a crumplet, waffle base is used. kudos to the fragrant light batter which married well with the poached egg and salmon.
We ventured to the far north-east for this, and while I relished the chill-out vibe of the locale – I really felt like I wasn\'t in Singapore, the food was quite hit-and-miss.
Brunch is only available on weekends, opens from 9.30am onwards. Located in a far corner of Singapore in Punggol at 10 Tebing Lane, it was the.. nearest cafe to me 🙌 (Alight at LRT Riveria and walk 5-10mins) Decided to go early on a saturday thinking I\'d be the first few to arrive anyway since it\'s so ulu.. but only 9.45am and the place was almost three quarters filled 😅 But the ambience was great, being open spaced and facing the park/reservoir. It\'s a different experience from the usual cafes. Items featured in the photo includes: Egg benedict (poached eggs with hollandaise sauce on waffles) with choice of sauteed mushrooms $10.80/Ham &amp; Pinapple Pizza $16.80/ Latte $5-6 (can\'t rmb😓) Verdict: The egg benedict waffles wasn\'t as good as the first time I tried it (this was my second visit here) and it was all soft, soggy and tasted weird. And also, I should have stuck with my fav smoked salmon instead of those mushrooms.. But! The pizza saved the day. I\'m not really a pizza person, but it was delish enough to me 😍 I hope their waffles standard would go back to the first time I was here 4 months ago though. 4.0/5.0.
😍🌹 /w rose cream, rose macaron &amp;&amp;&amp; berry fruits 🍓🍒🍓🍒 Shelf behind is filled with old school toys and snacks!! 🏮✨✨✨
Super duper gorgeous served up in a pan and oh so creamy when I slid my spoon in ☺️☺️☺️ Everything was done just right. Not overwhelmingly cheesy, slightly charred on the surface with fragrant ham evenly distributed throughout 😍 Managed to wipe out the whole pan without feeling gelat. SO GOOD YESSS 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Must create new verb for this far flung location aka \"the lalang place\" (a whole field of it just next to us // perfect for ootd and MVs hahahaha). This was my go-when-in-Serangoon place in my list. Much ❤️❤️❤ for the food! #juronggirl91 #worththetravel
Vongole pasta was pretty decent and I love how the white wine sauce complements the clams. However it would be better if the dish was slightly more flavorful! The Mac N Cheese was tasty and creamy, no further explanation needed! 
The nice greenery surrounding the place probably out do the green tea tiramisu here but still a good attempt. 
Walk under the rain to whisk and paddle and we found it worth . Raining day dine at river side , windy and enjoyable . 
Mac and cheese,nachos with chicken and egg benedict waffle with smoked salmon. Food was average nothing interesting or special :/ For the nachos the chicken portion was too little total waste of my $3 and the nachos was hard and oily. In my opinion the Mac and cheese was the best out of all 3. The melted cheese was just nice and it wasn\'t too creamy perfect pairing with that tough nachos. However won\'t be wasting 1hour of my time traveling all the way there again but it was worth the try. 
Not an everyday affair for me (cause I\'m mildly lactose intolerant), but this dish wasn\'t an overkill, making it pretty easy to finish up everything (not on my own of course)! The elbow macaroni absorbed the cream &amp; cheese pretty well &amp; the slight char did add to the flavors! This would be a \"should order\" whenever you visit! Also, the view around the area is pretty scenic too! Too bad we went at night, we could only see the sunflowers that were planted by the store owners, located by the side of the store 🌻 #Burpple #aroundwithamd #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #openricesg #whatI8today

The Berry Rose Tart ($7.5) was a lovely mix of both, and I had the Mac&amp;Cheese ($12.9) served with ham. The location is perfect as well, with an open-concept that allows for the natural breeze and lighting (haha) and the place is very spacious!
#WhiskAndPaddle #SGcafe #Burpple
Great friendly cafe to catch up with friends. A little out of the way, but the wide open spaces and nature by Punggol Riverside are lovely and remind me of home.
The freshly baked tart is filled with lined with chocolate sauce before filling with light passionfruit curd and top with a meringue plus chocolate macaron. A must try if you come down!
The Whisk Breakfast ($16.80) comes with a choice of egg (we choose the creamy scrambled egg), Macaroni &amp; Cheese ($12.80) and Elderflower Pear Italian Soda ($5.50). The ambience is good as it faces the Punggol waterfront but it can be quite humid if you don\'t seat near the fan.
🍰👐🏼🍰 -\n<br />On the side note, review on FYR Cyene Ond Drinc is up on the web. 🙊 blessed week guys.
Walked half the reservoir to reach thr, then I realised I could hav just sat LRT instead.😂 Mac and cheese was gr8 but lesser portions that expected. The Ham &amp; Pineapple 🍕  was decent. 🍟 was awesome with the truffle Mayo sauce, I didn\'t hav enough and more sauce was addt $2 😭. Also ordered their toast for dessert and it was heavenly I loved it and would be back for it definitely. ❤️
I can now understand why the Punggolians were so proud of their neighborhood. The serenity, view and music here were amazing balls.
This cafe probably tops the list of the cafes I\'ve visited so far. Place was a little ulu but it was so worth it for the nice scenery surrounding the place and the glorious food. I loved the Mac &amp; Cheese- it cost $12 for that huge plate?
pizza crust was crispy, a plus for me, and look at that oozing of the egg yolk. \n<br />however I\'m told that during busy days you gotta wait at least an hour for de food here. so what\'s this one hour waiting time cafes are having these days? I certainly wouldn\'t come back if I\'ve to wait an hour for this.
Awesome waffles. Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside. The caramelized bananas go oh so well with it!
Love their well-cooked juicy tomatoes on the plate! It\'ll be even more satisfying if their poached eggs are more watery &amp; drizzled with more sauce! On the other hand, their waffles are totally my type, crispy! Satisfied with the drinks as well, 🍸🍹cool for a hot day👍 Definitely a place to revisit to chill &amp; relax &amp; enjoy the breeze!! But sad to say that their \"all-day-breakfast\" is not always available!! Depends on your luck:(
Enjoy all-day brunch fare, hearty mains and gorgeous desserts with your best friends amidst tranquility at this riverside cafe by Punggol Waterway. Whisk &amp; Paddle offers unobstructed views of the resevoir with good food and drink to boot -- a much-needed respite at any time of day. For brunch, dig into comforting dishes like Eggs Ben with Smoked Salmon on Waffles, or a warm pan of Mac and Cheese. For a sweet treat, choose from their range of desserts in their display, and sit back with a cuppa to enjoy the view. If you can\'t decide, opt for the Berries Rose Tart, or the humble Earl Grey Lavender Loaf. By night, wind down and swop out the desserts and coffee for bar bites and ice cold beer!
Coffee by the river and greens. This place is quiet and the surroundings provide you with the oxygen and space to think. Happy hour till 8pm daily!
Make of fresh berries and rose extract cream, one of the must try desserts in Whisk &amp; Paddle! 🙆🙆🙆
Whisk &amp; Paddle is the perfect spot to relax away from the crazy. Sip on drinks and stare at the waters as the breeze caresses your hair. Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Chua Xing Wei #Burpple
Such as Artistry, The Lokal, Common Man Coffee, Whisk &amp; Paddle etc. Go on to @burpple for more details. Blessed lunar new year eve! ☺️
Feel like taking a breather from the festivities for a couple of hours? This is just the spot to relax, have a drink of your choice, and stare at the resevoir. Noone here will ask you when you\'re getting married, promise.   *Only drinks &amp; limited Festive Oriental Menu available, open 2-10pm
Because when it comes to deadlines, it\'s no pleasure at all.
*fatdieme* taking a break after a long day at work. besides, tmrw is Friday!
The place and the view was awesome. great food and I was in love with their tables #tablecrush.  @Mac &amp; Cheese : $14, Egg benedict with Ham @$15+, Mocha &amp; Ice Honey Lemon  
Sunday brunch 
Now where can I get one like this? 😍 • \n<br />What\'s left were the desserts the other day as the one of the equipment in their kitchen broke down. Thus they stop taking orders an hour earlier from the supposed last order for the savoury food. But was later offered to tag along with the table beside us (who came in later) to order from a selected items on the menu. How appropriate 😏
Impressive menu selection with creative dishes and drinks.\n<br />Ordered the special breakfast and cheese macaroni + drinks
No more being the odd one out when we stand on chairs to capture this shot 😂
Great place to unwind w a cup of coffee and sweets. 🍰
Too wattery. More like pasta base than cheese
Really tasty mash and sautéed mushrooms. Wish the sausage was bigger though 
Was pretty disappointed when we reached and they told us that their kitchen is closing at 8 and they are out of cotton candy! So end up we ordered the lychee pizza which taste pretty good if they don\'t add it too much veggie haha
Looks like perfect brunch food for the weekend. Photo by Burppler Elaine Koh #burpple

Hope your sunday had been well so far! Mine not so good.... difficult tutee and awkward situations 😧
Like it how the french toast is custardy and moist inside(maybe not cooked thoroughly?!) But it\'s like having pumped custard filling inside the french toast. Scrambled eggs were decent but the portion was alittle small (eggs lovers need more eggs!) Bacon was flavourful not too salty.
[BERRIES ROSE TART S$7.50] - desserts are all made in house. So pretty! 
After Cravings Cafe, we hopped over here. \n<br />Thanks to Whisk and Paddle for serving us even though it\'s half an hour past your closing time😆
Food was good but service was slow. 
First attempt on the pizzas here. The crust was thick yet crisp enough, and we loved how stringy that layer of cheese was. It comes with a tinge of spiciness, and savoury slices of smoked duck with semi-sweet lychee to tickle the tastebuds, but the heavy-tasting greens added seemed to have overwhelmed the otherwise decent pizza.
Was served lukewarm to almost cold... However, pasta was good and flavourful.
Comfort on a chilly day. Pretty decent mac &amp; cheese, extremely comforting on a rainy afternoon/evening.
The fish meat was tender and have a slight beer taste to it.
The lily collins of the tart world, looking sweet and pretty. I like the details of the rose macaron. Coffee wise... not too good.
Breaking open to the pistachio creme, we loved the natural taste without the artificial essence like what some places do. It wasn\'t too sweet for us, with the right flavours and combination that won us over! [Photograph taken with Nikon 750]
this was a satisfying one that hit all the right notes. perfectly poached eggs with salinity from the smoked salmon, textures were well-complemented by the slight crisp from the waffles underneath! check out our review on Whisk &amp; Paddle as it has just become one of our favourite cafe spots!
Facing Punggol Reservoir, this two-week old eatery is ideal for anyone who loves looking out at greenery and feeling the breeze, while downing a beer or savouring a cake. Wide menu selection with unique homemade ice teas. I had an adequate portion of the crabmeat linguine, and this citrus earl grey pound cake was pretty good - strong taste of the earl grey with a slight crust on the outside, and just lightly sweet. Great place to chill out alone or with friends or family. They even have a children\'s play corner!
This early grey pound cake from @whiskandpaddlesg was awesome! \n<br />I wish they had banana pound cakes though!
Served with cheese sauce and zingy salsa sauce, the tortilla chips are crispy to bite but a tad too dry after a few munch. It would be good to have more melted cheese to go with the chips since it\'s pretty tasteless on its own.
Brioche french toast with vanilla beans ice cream and caramelised banana and chocolate syrup. The bananas were not sliced, instead it was chopped into small bits that does not fully contain the caramel taste. French toast was well made, fragrant and chewy.
From Whisk &amp; Paddle at 10 Tebing Lane. They use a Quattro blend here; in other words a blend of beans from four origins namely Brazil, Mexico, U.S. and Colombia. The roast seemed rather dark, which makes for its heavy body with nutty and earthy tones.
My love for Earl Grey Cakes triggered me to order this one at Whisk &amp; Paddle, a new cafe at 10 Tebing Lane. Loved how this one was; soft and spiked with enough Earl Grey tea leaves for that aromatic flavour, with a bit of zestiness from the candied lemon on the top. If you love the variant from Brawn &amp; Brains, this one is actually a pretty decent contender to it.
From Whisk &amp; Paddle at 10 Tebing Lane. Hazelnut-filled puff pastry. While the pastry seemed to be a wee bit dry, that rich Hazelnut cream pretty much saved it, coming with chocolate wafer balls for a crunchy bite.
There\'s really a lot of cafés opening around Singapore lately, but Whisk &amp; Paddle seemed to have that vibe that I had been looking for. Spacious, cozy with full view of a reservoir. Indulge in some cakes while admiring the view and enjoying that breeze, or go for some all-day breakfast or pasta if you are feeling hungry. A great place for some solitude indeed ...
Woke up to a drizzly morning in friend’s apartment (steamboat, ps4, countdown and Hennessy 😋) Since we are hungry and in the far far away corner of Singapore, I have always wanted to visit Whisk&amp; Paddle (Punggol is really far) so I did! Thanks to girlfriend driving over with a lil’ tipsy brain (aftermath of Hennessy) 😘 It was brunch hours when we reached W&amp;P so we decided to try out their mains instead of all-day breakfast menu. \n<br />Steak Fries with Truffled Mayo; $10.80\n<br />Mac&amp; Cheese; $13.80\n<br />Vongole Linguine; $17.80\n<br />The linguine, served with generous with the amount of clams was really good. You can taste white wine in every mouthful and it is just about the right amount. \n<br />A good meal starts of a good day they say. Very true 😍 #sgfood #singaporecafe #singaporestyle #burpplefood #whiskandpaddle #burpplesg #burpple #burpplebrunch #burpplecafe #punggol #brunchtime #western #macandcheese #steakfries #truffledmayo #vongolelinguine #feedmefood2018
The melted cheese kinda glued all the chips together, making them rather troublesome to tear apart. They came in a really big plate so please order to share with your friends, the 3 of us couldn’t even finish it !
Had a feast at @whiskandpaddlesg ! Love the Mac and Cheese , Nachos and the pasta was also dente ! Found the desserts to be more good looking that taste alluring . #sgfoodie #sgfoodhunt #sgfoodporn #sginstafood #sgfoodgram #sgfoodblog #sgfoodblogger #burpple #sgcafes #sgcafescene #foodstagram #foodie #foodgram #foodporn #foodart #whati8todaysg #wheretoeatsg #punggol #singapore #instafood #macandcheese #pizza #pasta
-\n<br />Tastes like it was made in-house, it was a lighter broth base compared to the usual creamy type chowder.\n<br />7/10⭐️

Mexican grilled corn and Louisiana wings.
Nachos - light and crisp!
Yummy pizza, comes with a sunny side up!
Egg-tra special start to the day
Perfect thirst quencher in this sweltering heat
Chocolate waffles &amp; vanilla ice cream (a combi that will never go wrong), accompanied with creme brûlée and a crème caramel topped with chocolate sauce. Sharing this gorgeous looking dessert with your good friends while having light conversation amidst cool breeze and tranquility at this riverside cafe by Punggol Waterway offers some much needed respite.
Really generous serving of mushroom and Omelette
It\'s going down, I\'m yelling tender ~
The accompanying dip wasn\'t that fantastic either.\n<br />•\n<br />Perhaps I should have ordered the chocolate cake instead. 😪

Exploring this part of Singapore today and relishing the signature Cha Yen Krup ($9.80) here @whiskandpaddlesg, a tranquil riverside cafe. This was such a delightful Thai Milk Tea Parfait and wasn\'t overly sweet for me.

This egg Benedict was a good twist with waffle that was crispy on the outside yet fluffy within. An oozy yolk simply added to the satisfaction for a good start to the Sunday. #burpple #burpplesg #burpplecafemonth #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #breakfast #eggbenedict
This is sesame latte, one of the more unique drinks that I had came across at a cafe. If you like the taste of black sesame, definitely give this a go! They even managed to make latte art with this. Whisk and Paddle is definitely out of the way, but the food was pretty good. I liked their eggs benny which came on a slab of waffle instead of bread or an English muffin. | #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgcafe #sgcafes #sgcafehopping #cafelife #latte #sesame #blacksesame #burpple #ASandHP #instafood_sg #eatoutsg
Nice place in the middle of Punggol Waterway although I would think the prices border slightly on the high end all things considered (especially wrt their drinks menu).\n<br />#sgcafe #sgcafehopping #punggolwaterway #cafe #waffle #brunch #breakfast #sgfoodie #burpple
I wouldn\'t normally travel that far just to have brunch but it was a good choice after Coney Island. The place WA super packed and I am not surprised. There\'s not many places in the area for a nice big brekkie. The food (thank God!) was worth the wait. My only complaint was that the over easy eggs were a bit over done. #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #instafood #instagood #burpple #weekendbrunch

Their iconic Mac &amp; cheese comes with baked ham and onion, served with warm cheese and pink sauce. The charred bits add a nice, slightly crunchy texture to the dish. \n<br />Overall, a nice venue to enjoy the peace of nature paired with good eats.
Waffles were light and buttery, complimented the eggs &amp; salmon well
How about a pan of sizzling hot m.a.c and cheese in this cooling weather ! Macaroni , baked ham and onion cooked in pink sauce and cheese. Have a great day everyone! ☝️😍\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #singaporefood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instagramfood #instafood #exploresingapore #macandcheese #macaroni #exploresingaporecafes #whiskandpaddle #whiskandpaddlesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodcafe
Huge prawns! Love how the pizza taste like biscuit! 
We were damn shag really. \n<br />Apart from the good view of Punggol Serangoon reservoir, you get decent food cooked with herbs that are self-grown by the cafe. Recommended place to lazy out in the afternoons. \n<br />Not too shabby for $19.80++ except I can\'t seem to figure out the sauce in that little cup. \n<br />#breakfast #whiskandpaddle #cafe #brunch #burpple

finally got to try their sweet potato gnocchi.. different from what we had previously at another cafe.. it was also good but hoping there will be more serving of gnocchi.. 😊😊 A great day spent together.. looking forward to next upcoming.. ❤❤ #onthetable #nomnomnom #mycafediary #sgcafe #cafe #burpple #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #nofilter #YOLO #foodspotting #sgfoodie #whati8today #hungrygowhere #instadaily #foodie #foodsg #igsg #igfood #sgig #foodporn #photooftheday #sgcafefood #llxyf
Sweet potato gnocchi, smoked duck breast, bacon chive cream sauce &amp; sweet potato chips. My favourite thus far. The smoked duck was so on point, being cooked to perfection. The cream sauce was very complimentary to the  sweet potato gnocchi, leaving me craving for more. A must try when you\'re here!!!
However we were distracted from the pleasant view by the ambrosial food🌷🍃| Whisk &amp; Paddles #Singapore #WhiskAndPaddle #Blogger #Cafes #CafeSg #SgFood #SgFoodiary #InstaFood #Burpple

Nachos ($9.8++) that were really good, except they shouldn\'t be serving the cheese &amp; salsa dips in these glass containers. As my dad dipped into the cheese dip, the glass container holding the cheese dip \"exploded\" with a really loud pop sound (sort of like a gunshot). The glass had cracked into smithereens &amp; was all over the nachos.
Seafood Marinara ($21.8++)

Everything that was placed on our table was absolutely delicious. We ordered the oh-so-legendary ham and pineapple pizza and it didn\'t disappoint at all. Really loved the thin crust and runny yolk in the middle! The Mac &amp; Cheese isn\'t like what other restaurants serve but unique in its own way whereby you don\'t get terribly sick of the flavour. Ordered the pork collar too which turned out perfectly cooked. It was tender and had a great taste to it and the mashed potato side was on point 👌 The staff was also super friendly and offered to add sausages to our eggs benedict (with an extra charge of course) upon hearing my little brother ask for it. A great place for dinner and I\'d definitely recommend it to those looking for a quiet place to hang with friends!

♚Treasure Island Honey Toast♚\n<br />Aesthetically appealing yet really sinful. The condiments added:Banana slices, caramalized popcorn and triple chocolate ice cream made the toast a hearty consumption. Its decently sweet enuf without the need for additional honey to be dipped. Nonetheless, tho this version of softer toast enabled the flavours to seep in more easily, i kinda still like crispier and crunchier crust versions.😉 #sgfood #burrple #foodgasm #fooddiary #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igers #foodporn #sgfoodporn #vscocam #sgig #food #dessert #sgdessert #thumbsup #foodie #likeforlike #onthetable #foodstamping #hungrygowhere #foodpic #sweettooth #vsco #instagram #instagramsg #delicious #webstagram #eat #cafe
