This dish looked messy when served but the goodness was definitely with the tasty pasta. Only thing I would pick on was the tiny crush shelves of the clams that made the chewing unpleasant 😅\n<br />🍝\n<br />#burpple
I usually shy away from fish dishes with the fear of encountering the fishy taste &amp; smell. I\'m glad to have gave this a try as the fish was very fresh &amp; soft &amp; rich with sweetness from the accompanied ingredients\n<br />🐟\n<br />#burpple
⋅\n<br />And that\'s why Symmetry has a special menu for dinner on Mondays to feed us well so that we can get through the rest of the week.\n<br />#SymmetrySG #CoffeeAndCravings
Not much of a salad but a nice and hearty combination of fresh and healthy ingredients.
Yaz! This is what a proper waffle stack should look like -- 4 light and fluffy golden brown beauties piled high, served with tart berry compote, streaks of peanut butter and nutella, banana slices, and chantilly cream &amp; maple syrup topped berry ice cream. 
Good night, peeps! It\'s Wednesday soon~\n<br />-\n<br />🇸🇬\n<br />-\n<br />📍 Symmetry\n<br />9 Jalan Kubor\n<br />Singapore 199206\n<br />Tel: 62919901
The soft buttery scrambled eggs sits perfectly on top of the juicy tender duck leg stuffed in between a hot and crispy croissant. Paired with it with all the time favourite truffle fries and dip. Yummy !
This is a delicious, comforting bowl of wonder. Generous portions of crab meat and the pesto sauce was spot on. Use the Amex Platinum Card for 50% off your bill.
Symmetry has always been popular for their awesome brunch menu but I urge you to try out their dinner menu. This Canelloni sent me to the moon and back. The Canelloni is filled with creamy prawns and scallop dipped in a creamy pesto (I think) and Roe. Every mouth is packed with flavours and texture. simply awesome!!!
I was over the moon when Symmetry is part of the dining privileges for AMEX . I love their brunch and to have dining deals for their dinner menu is just amazing. I had the Grey Shrimp pasta and it was lovely. It\'s a creamy based sauce. Its not too overly Richy and creamy which is how I liked my pasta to be . The shrimps was huge and generous and it was grilled to perfection. Not a very big portion so it\'s perfect for the ladies :) overall, I would say im super Impressed !
Loved the caramelization on the edges of the tender miso cod!! The linguine was well coated in the mentaiko sauce but I wish it were slightly less dry :( Also note that the portion is abit smaller than average so it\'s perfect for small eaters.
It is great to have a day off on Monday. #burpple #coffee #gingerbreadman
It\'s the month of June!
Look out for their Spicy Shrimp Pomodoro and their Wagyu with Yorkshire Pudding!
 roasted lamb shoulder, baba ghanoush, capsicum ragout. Love the earthy tones of the dish, balanced by the sweetness of the tomato base. Lamb chunks were tender and fell apart easily. Good dish! 
 Roasted carrot purée, charred spring onions, marcona almonds. Carrot purée was very smooth and rich in flavor. Loved the charred spring onions and the carrots, giving some smokiness to the buttery cod that simply melts in your mouth! 
I always love having brunch here. Food portion is big and food taste great with cozy ambience. But just to take note, some of the food will not serve during the late afternoon. 
Well balanced cuppa where the creamy milk and foam nicely complements the acidity of an otherwise very strong coffee. Nice touch with the cute gingerbread man shaped cookie at the side of this awesome flat white. While the atmosphere at Symmetry can get pretty claustrophobic and noisy especially during peak hours, if you love Proud Mary &amp; St Ali in Melbourne, you\'re gonna love this cafe, which channels that similar industrial interior finishes amidst a rustic brick ambience. 
Friday\'s lunch at a pretty cafe. Though this wasn\'t the original place that we wanted to go... but they serve good quality food.
Good mix of items. Enjoyed the scrambled eggs. Price is not as high as some brunch places. All in all, pretty decent. 
2 eggs of choice, maple-glazed bacons, smoked salmon, chicken cheese sausage, sautéed mushroom, potato hash, artisanal toast 》$24
Deceivingly low-key in appearance, the Cubano sandwich is a veritable TNT of flavours from the triple meats of soft, juicy roasted pork, salami and smoked ham. Credit must be given to the hardworking housemade pickle - it did an awesome job, along with the Gruyere and mustard, of creating a happy equilibrium. 
Oh! It\'s the 7th day of lunar new year, happy birthday to all my lovelies! And also Happy Valentine\'s Day. 😘
I wished i can brunch all day everyday but there\'s something called work!
|\n<br />Classic English Big Breakfast. The special part will be their \"berry\" butter on toast. Good old sunny side up and big sausage. .\n<br />|\n<br />Will I return just for this? Maybe not.
Foie gras burger was composed of braised beef cheeks, black truffle, caramelized onions, beetroot and foie gras. Enjoyed the tenderness of the beef cheeks. They literally melted in my mouth. 👍 The twice cooked beef short ribs were also extremely tender and easy on the palette. 👍 However, the panna cotta was flooded in raspberry jam which overwhelmed all other flavors. 👎👎 Panna cotta was fine on it\'s own, but not worth the price. I guess we were paying for the candle-lit, cosy and comfortable atmosphere and helpful service. 👍 Overall an enjoyable experience. 😊
Had the pork belly charsiew croissant with scrambled eggs - sounds very heavy but it wasn\'t at all. Good balance of flavors with the sweet charsiew glaze and savory everything else. 
🌼6.5/10\n<br />The smell is like rly strong but it taste like legit juz normal fries with mayo.. .-. The taste of truffle is not that strong but the smell of it is strong. And this cost like $15? Quite ex lah but there\'s a lot of fries so maybe worth a bit uh.. 😢😐
Tiny croquettes that have a potato-cheese filling with bits of crispy bacon. A good starter to share, if not it can get a little gelat. Priced at $16, it is a little steep imo. 
Scrambled eggs, nice fried mushroom, simple salad with toasted bread. Overall: 3/5 stars
.\n<br />Symmetry Waffles; waffles are crispy on the outside, just the way I like. Batter is also not too sweet. The berries ice cream was on-point, with a tinge of sourness to balance out the sweetness from the peanut butter and chocolate hazelnut spread.\n<br />.\n<br />Hearty lunch with le BFF after Ohvola Warehouse Sale. Love sinful girly dates like this ❤️❤️❤️.
Ordered the Pink Shrimp Croissant. Add $4 to change truffles fries! They\'re awesome! Will definitely come back for that!
I like that the peppery wilted watercress cut the richness of the fatty meat. It is hard to go wrong with beef short ribs, as long as they are not overcooked. My favourite dish of the day!\n<br />#EileenFoodTasting #Symmetrysg #Sgcafe #CafeHoppingSg #FatFatMeatSeries #Beef #Burpple
Super love 💕 Always heard good reviews for the ones at @symmetrysg and i wasn\'t disappointed 😊👍🏼
$16.0 per bottle, 330ml, abv 4.5% filled with strawberry lime. Here for a friend\'s bday and the ambience is youngy-lots of youngsters 
☺️ Regretting that I didn\'t order the truffle fries because I heard it\'s the best?😭
And that gingerbread man, is my favorite companion with coffee. 😍
Pink Shrimp Croissant [S$21] shrimp meat marinated in Japanese mayo, topped with fish roe and sandwiches between scrambled eggs and crispy buttery croissant. Comes with skinny french fries.\n<br />Did I mention that they also serve my fav Chai Tea Latte [S$7] in Singapore ? Not the cheapest but definitely the best for me and crew 😁. Gingerbread man included.
.\n<br />Omg their lunch menu is amazing as well, we\'ve got the Pink Shrimp Croissant ($21++) + $4 to change our fries to TRUFFLE FRIES! The croissant was so well toasted with shrimp, fish roe and scrambled eggs! And also the Roast Chicken Thigh ($24++) that was oh so tender! Hehe!\n<br />.\n<br />You know how good their truffle fries are when my mum couldn\'t stop stuffing her face with them! We will be back for MORE! 😍😍😍
SO GOOD, i tell you. I... I CANNOT.
Not just pretty but taste pretty too. \n<br />Thank you @explodingbelly and @symmetrysg for the invite. 💁🏿
WA. And I never knew they had a dinner menu!\n<br />.\n<br />In commemoration of their 3rd, they\'ve specially came up with a menu featuring ALL their classics, like this Black Angus Steak Tartar ($21) from their starter menu! OOOH! Loved the egg, and so did @gudetama!\n<br />.\n<br />Remember to get their truffle fries while you\'re there, cause it\'s pretty damn awesome! And THEY HAVE ONE FOR ONE COCKTAILS ON WEDNESDAYS TOO!
No. Actually just having a good meal with GUDETAMA, who by the way dropped on the floor THRICE today.
It\'s also the place where I had one of the best truffle fries back then. Ahhhh food coma now 😌
The pumpkin mash tasted more like mashed potatoes, but it was tasty nevertheless (loved the capers). Fish was good too. Tad pricey though. 
There is always a special place this drink holds in my heart. Forget Bloody Mary, I always thought the vodka doesn\'t quite go with the tomato juice. I keep it clean and healthy...It\'s my brunch beverage anyway.
Well yes, just about any cafe would be serving their version of Egg Benedict which has taken Singapore brunch scene by storm over the past 18/24 months. It was Symmetry which rekindled my interest in having a go with their rendition (after I have totally given up after Au Petit Salut closed and Wild Honey changed their formulae). It certain exceeds expectations!
I love the berry butter that went so well with my bread. And the mushrooms and hash brown was yummy. The scrambled eggs were perfect, slightly runny, wet yet firm all at the same time. The service there was superb as well, the lady server was pleasant and prompt, it really made today\'s bunch such an enjoyable one ;)
Got the waffles ($16) with berry ice cream, pb, Nutella, summer berries compote, banana, syrup and whipped cream. Waffles were a little soggy however the combination of flavours on the plate made up for it I guess. Also got a bucket of truffle fries ($15) which was definitely 100% delicious
The pastry was excellent, thin, crispy and tasty by itself. Love the combination of the creamy potato and the earthy mushrooms. Very classy. The pork cheeks were super tender and flavourful. Wished there was more though! The arugula went well to lighten the cheesiness. Priced at $24. 
And Truffle makes everything taste better!
To be honest, I\'m not a very huge salmon fan especially sashimi but I\'m still quite fine with smoked salmon. So I thought this would fit fine with my palate. First impression was the portion looked a bit small for $24 but boy I was wrong, I was really full by the end of this plate. I loved the poached eggs, really runny and nice but the whole combination of poached eggs, avocado, beetroot (that pink sauce) and salmon kinda somehow didn\'t sit well with me.. I just finished it because I\'m paying so much for it. However, the coffee hereeeeee, hehe like what I said before this post, must drink and it\'s good! Hehehe.
I loved my cup of flat white this morning at symmetry. The coffee was acidic and strong! Hehe just the way I like it. And I think I will come back really just for the coffee (not really the food...) and the super crazy hipster vibe of the place.
Nothing much to say about the food here. It was pretty average and run of the mill. I liked the hot chocolate - but it wasn\'t served hot. I like the vibe here. Quirky place

Truffle heaven with well cooked scrambled eggs on toast. Love the ambience of the cafe. With the rustic look and decorations~
Poached eggs were perfect (I can only imagine how good their Eggs Benedict would be!) 🍴mushrooms were full of flavour! Food here is on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for 👌#symmetrysg @ Jalan Kubor📍••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n<br />☞Wifi Available☜ 🚇Nearest Station: Bugis, Exit B
One more day to the long weekend! One more day to brunch!😁✌🏻️
Oddly enough, this didn\'t wow the way I thought it would. The pork belly was flavourful but the golden-coloured crackling let it down as it was rubbery. And even though \"smoked pork sausage, bacon and cannelloni ragout, apple and fennel remoulade, cayenne pepper\" (I\'m quoting from the menu) appeared in some form or other, the dish as a whole was underwhelming for me. 
The mushrooms were meaty and juicy. And as expected of the truffle scrambled eggs here, it was expertly executed for maximum silkiness. The truffle aroma wasn\'t all that strong but I suspect it was the truffle fries we had gotten to share, that drowned it out.\n<br />Interestingly, unlike most egg dishes that feature salmon, theirs came with a fresh one instead of smoked. Slow-cooked, the result was a very moist and tender fish. Also jostling for space on the plate were a mesclun salad and toast (served with a pat of berry butter). Come to think of it, this dish was one big mish-mash of flavours. 
Everything you see here: the buffalo mozzarella, baby tomatoes and artisan toast, flourished with freshness. Piquing our tastebuds even more were the drizzle of citrus berries vinigrette and dressing for the tomatoes (which I\'m pretty sure are made in-house).\n<br />This platter of loveliness is ideal as an appetiser for sharing, or as a light meal for one.
We thought it was just another cafe serving run-of-the-mill brunch recipes, but were pleasantly surprised. Every dish is special, judging by its description in the menu and choice of ingredients. We only had space in our stomach for 3 dishes, but will probably return to the rest.
Tasted pretty good but I wouldn\'t pay $22 to have it again. Overall, good experience at Symmetry. Fast and friendly service but not exactly worth the price. 
Heard that this place serves one of the best truffle fries around. The portion was quite generous but I don\'t think it was really that worth the $15. Don\'t get me wrong, it was good but I\'ve had similar ones (or even better) at a cheaper price. :)
Seasoning was tasteful and balanced for all three. Crab pesto ($24) had a very good blend of truffle oil, pesto sauce, and reasonable portions of crab. The other two were already strong tasting on their own, and the infusion of seasoning balanced the tastes just as well. Definitely worth another visit! Only downside was the pricing though, had to give the truffle fries ($15) a miss.
Crisp fries served with mayo and topped with parmesan cheese shavings. Symmetry\'s truffle fries are well- seasoned and of a decent portion but more truffle oil please!
Stop #1 @symmetrysg.\n<br />1. Big Breakfast.\n<br />2. Symmetry Eggs.\n<br />Flat white x Matcha latte
The menu listed this as a \"reconstructed\" lemon tart, but i\'m pretty sure they meant \"deconstructed\". A for effort when it comes to plating!
Known for its dark, hipster interior and good food, Symmetry commands a queue on weekends, making reservations a must. Start off with the Crispy Baby Squid ($14) or the Truffle Fries ($15), a crowd favourite with its heady truffle aroma in a seemingly bottomless bucket. Go for the Truffle Eggs Mushroom ($22) — scrambled eggs drizzled with truffle oil, sauteed mushrooms, a slice of toast and hashbrown — or the Big Breakfast ($24) for its insanely good blueberry butter. Finally, finish off by sharing their epic waffles ($16), it is a beautiful mess of bananas, strawberries, peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate, maple syrup and vanilla ice cream. The coffee here is excellent, sure to please all you coffee fiends; they use the Slayer!
2 munchies: I wasn\'t expecting the Eggs Sur Le Plat here would disappoint. Besides the slightly overdone eggs and heavy creamed baby spinach, there was way too much sausages in the tomato-based stew, making the overall dish cloyed and too savoury.
Menu on a Monday night. Wanted to try the other food they have though 
The minute steak may have been slightly tough to bite through in parts but packed in between the ciabatta with the meltingly-soft Gruyere cheese, fresh arugula, mustard, red onions, piquillo (a sweet sort of capsicum) and brown butter emulsion, it delivered a worthy experience nonetheless.\n<br />The title of \"Most Impressive Item On The Plate\" however, went to the truffle fries. Think of it as the back-up singer who floored the crowd by out-singing the famous star. 
$15 for this dessert of lemon curd, ice cream, marshmallow, biscuits. the lemon curd was really yummy!
Just like how little coffee there was in my cup. 😒 still can\'t get over the pathetic serving at Symmetry. For the same price, we usually get double the amount. Tsk.
If you prefer something cold, be sure to try the Symmetry\'s cold brew. 
Not sure if I read the menu wrongly. This is a terrible carbonara. Did I order carbona-soup?
This was not exactly what I was expecting, but it came out alright 6.5/10. The ham (with the fatty layer) was much thinner slice than what I was expecting. Ok, I got a bit carried away thinking the name suggests a whole block of ham! But it was slightly pan fried which makes it nice. The pancetta would have been better if it\'s toasted/grilled to be crispy (PLT sandwich does it best). Worth mentioning is the home made mustard (yes, it\'s brown not yellow) which complements the ham &amp; pancetta. The harsh brown is a little out of place (think DOC\'s fried cheese nuggets) and the toast, at best ordinary.
foie gras hamburger. i must be too greedy to think they would serve me the foie gras as the whole patty. lol. but that small slab there makes it up with quality. take a small cut of that foie gras and paired it with the braised meat and you get incredible texture and flavors just explodes in your mouth
roasted lamb rack had such a rosy pink that we were slightly concerned. the knife in was almost effortless but a mouth in and all doubts melted like how the protein melted in our mouths. zero gamey and dish wasnt heavy at all.
tender smoked duck breast with escargot parcel was paired cleverly with potato balls and diced prunes meat (i think) in sweet sauce. again, the fried parcel was light, allowing the escargot texture to come through. although i hoped for stronger taste form smoked breast and escargot, it was a well balanced dish, keeping it light and considerate for the mains.
to make up the recent lousy dinner at fairmont prego, i opted for symmetry at next makan session. our starter with crispy baby squids - lightest crunch from the batter makes you keep wanting more. love that they made use of the squid ink with black pepper and mayo to give a complete summation using squid and a peppery zest to this dish.
Anytime!
TGIF! Still lazing in bed wishing for a cuppa!
They lived up to the name of serving the best weekend brunch, no wonder there are always Q and packed very weekend. The menu is quite limited but that\'s good enough as everything taste awesome! 
How are you chilling on this rainy Saturday? Have to avoid dairy for a while, so I\'m having soy cappuccino instead (which explains the funny coffee art). The coffee taste is not strong enough but it\'s quite smooth.
On first glance it looks like fu rong dan with smoked salmon on top. But I got to love the generous serving of big prawns, scallops and salmon! 😋
Brunch is always a good idea at symmetry! Really adore their scrambled eggs. But brunch are usually on the pricier side.
Clearing some latergrams. Relaxing gingy on my latte. Pretty naise blend from symmetry!
$22 - portion wasn\'t big but the food was great. al dente. clam stock and olive oil topped with Parmesan, chive with clam, cherry tomato. A little oily but delicious! Vongole shall be my new favourite pasta. Anyone with recommendations for some good vongole pasta?!
Peanut butter chocolate bananas mix berries compote vanilla ice cream whipped cream maple syrup perfect crispy fluffy waffle
Coffee isn\'t all about sipping or tasting it. It\'s all about you meeting the right people. If you\'re here @ Symmetry for coffee. Please do not hesitate to look for Chris the main barista to pour your coffee. He does serve one good cup of coffee!
Back here again, but no waffles today because someone is too full..
that amazing jam and the probably better den well done scrambled eggs. yes I need this now.
TGIT. Work week is coming to an end, soon! Some coffee for a little caffeine kick! I seem to be sleeping fewer hours everyday 😅 #burpple
Seduction in sandwich form is when a tender piece of sweetish smoked pork jowl is presented between the halves of a butter croissant, along with portobello mushroom, a ridiculously creamy scrambled egg, avocado and tangy hickory sauce. Not to be outdone, the crisp fries and lightly-dressed salad were worthy companions.
Although they are slightly pricer than most cafes, the food served was definitely worth the money that you pay for. The white miso cod was goooood 👍👌 (better than the ones I\'ve had at five and dime 🙊🙊). Also in the picture: Grilled beef steak. 
One of the best around! 
Only this was available as the kitchen was closed on that day. But it was good though
on another note, I\'m so afraid of needles, yet I\'m having a body checkup later. 😱😱😱 #blessme
panbaked. a furry of rockets, tomato base cut up sausages, two free range eggs, a brioche. my kind of breakfast after a long hiatus.
Love the industry, love the vibes. Perfect for a catch up, whether friends or for business. Sat at the bar, and it puts you in the mood for innovation! Grabbed the cold brew and macha latte.
This is my second time here, like I said before I didn\'t like the ambience and service but I could make do with the quality of food served. The eggs Ben ($22) is to die for. Unique twist to the classic poached eggs on muffin with hollandaise sauce. The texture of egg is cooked to perfection that it can be picked up easily even when it\'s broken. Did I mention the honey glazed bacon? Mmmmm~ the eggs sur Le plat($24) is equally delightful but I find it a little overpriced. Still acceptable for a one time try, they were generous with the servings of chorizo sausages.
The place is tucked in a corner of the street that hardly anyone goes to but it\'s full house inside the cafe. We got there at midday without reservation and it was no problem at all. The variety of food is great and interesting, good portion and very tasty. We tried the recommended hit chocolate and marshmallow, ham and pork knuckle, eggs sur le plat. All good! What\'s awful about this place is that it\'s too noisy and it makes it un enjoyable to have a conversation. I ended up disliking the ambience 10 mins in. They have an outdoor dining area which is great and they switched the fans on too but there\'s no one utilizing the space and no waiters too. It\'s odd. 
Arrived at 5plus and had a drink and truffle fries whilst waiting for the dinner menu (which starts at 6)
Grilled pork with Hicktory sauce and melted cheese, complimented with Avacado! Having one piece is really just not enough! 
I don\'t fancy fries but I love truffle fries. Dipped in the mayo sauce is just heavenly! You gotta try it out yourself to know how it exactly taste 
I love the truffles fries! It\'s worth the money cos it\'s a bucket of fries and it\'s heavenly!!! 😍
Love the smoldering poached eggs and honeyed bacon. The perfect breakfast to start your weekend!
This is proof that healthy doesn\'t have to be boring or tasteless. Every ingredient in this dish was prepared extremely well, allowing their natural flavours to shine bright. In particular, I was impressed by the chicken breast meat because it\'s challenging to get it so tender and moist. Also perfectly cooked was the quinoa. Perked up with sweet dried cranberries and honey-roasted hazelnuts, I couldn\'t shovel it into my mouth fast enough.\n<br />Although this dish is listed under the appetiser section of the menu, I find it\'s enough for a light lunch.
When I saw how cute the art was, I almost couldn\'t bear to drink it but that thought disappeared the second I took my first sip. Fragrant and bold, this was a green tea that held its own well and wasn\'t overpowered by the steamed, foamed milk. \n
Only had the dessert melon and berry ice cream, whilst my friends had the main course, The Symmetry hamburger and The BBQ pork belly. The Melon and Berry ice cream was a mixture of sweet and sourrr. 😆😆 the presentation was also wonderful! Of the three that we ordered, we definitely like the dessert best! 👍 and I also ordered one of their symmetry drink originals, Berry Prosecco. A Must Try!!!!! You can literally taste the berries! Wanted to order another one, but due to time constrain, we couldnt. 😪 but i look forward to coming again!!!! 
Duck leg with apricot croissant was good. The steak sandwich wasn\'t tasty. There\'s a smell in the steak. Milky milky Choco crunch milkshake 😋😋 &amp; home-made tea! Truffle fries wasn\'t up to my expectation. 
Nice brunch place hidden among the old shop houses near bugis. Loved their eggs ben and big brekkie.
This Saturday brunch was unarguably good, but the service was not reliable (needed to ask for water a few times till it showed up, very slow till serving food after ordering). We waited for one hour to get a table, and another 30 min to get food. Overall, it was not relaxing and just a tiring experience which wasn\'t so rewarding for the price of the food. 
Risso-what? It doesn\'t matter if you have no idea what rissoles are. Just know they are Tasty with a capital T. And that they resemble Japanese croquette, being crunchy-on-the-outside balls of mashed potatoes with bacon and cheese hidden within. They are rather deviously designed as well because after a while, I found it hard to keep count of how many I\'d eaten 😋
Can anyone ever get enough of this?! And the world answers with a resounding, \"Noooooooooooooo!\"
Although very creamy, there is a lot of depth and dimension to this angel hair pasta dish, thanks to the smoked pancetta, white wine and chives. Break the gently poached egg perched in the middle and spread its richness for extra oomph.
The shredded crabmeat comes from an actual crab claw to give this pasta an edge of authentic sweetness-from-the-sea. I did, however, find the hazelnut basil pesto sauce a little under-seasoned even though it was delicious. A dash of Tabasco sauce (sorry if this disgusts the purists among you) made it instantly better.
When something as beautiful as this appears in front of me, I tend to mentally prepare myself for the twinge of disappointment that inevitably follows because seldom does it taste as good as it looks.\n<br />This time though, the odds were trounced good and proper - the dish was simply delicious. My fork went through the braised beef cheeks like hot knife through butter. And that large piece of pan-seared foie gras was divine. It\'s clear that attention was lavished upon every item on the plate, given how perfect they all turned out to be.
Yes, it\'s an expensive sandwich but after cramming it in my mouth, I can conclude it is deserving of its price.\n<br />For one, the duck confit filling is amazing. You know how some versions are dry and stringy? It is not the case here at all. They cook the leg of the duck very well, retaining juiciness and rich flavour. Also, the slight saltiness of the duck meat gets along like a house on fire with the creamy mayo, sweet apricot preserve and caramelised onions. Oh, and do you see that gorgeous egg puffing up my croissant? Now that was a yummy surprise because there\'s no mention of it in the menu. Excellent sandwich aside, the fries were crisp and the salad, fresh. A must-try.\n
The food was decent but I found it was a tad overpriced! 
Had this almost 4 hours ago and I\'m still vibrating from the caffeine. No complaints about that whatsoever. It\'s wimpy coffees that I have no patience for.
Surprisingly, this turned out to be completely unremarkable. With each forkful, I tried very hard to persuade myself to change my mind but to no avail. The sauce in which the spagetti was cooked, was the issue for me. \"Garlic, togarashi (Japanese red pepper), konbu (kelp), Parmesan cheese, white wine, olive oil and chives\" simply didn\'t translate that successfully from description to my tastebuds.\n<br />I\'ve always loved every dish I have ever had here, as affirmed by my previous Burps about Symmetry. But I guess there is always a first time for everything. 
You need to try the truffle fries!! For me, it\'s the most delicious truffle fries in SG! And for the bacon brunch (i forgot the name) , it tastes good. 
😋This will be my all time fave cafe for now.
Perfect for a hot weather like today. It didn\'t disappoint. Paired it with green tea latte, to complement and balance out the sweetness 
Can you ever say no to this delicious cup of goodness. || Price: S$6.50
Soft sous vide egg wrapped in bacon and blow torched hollandaise sauce, on top of chewy english muffin with saute mushroom, one of the best i\'ve had, hands down.
Their Eggs Benedict come in large portions - which are delectable and would be satisfying to your stomach. A cafe to visit in the Bugis area, especially to try out their signature Truffle Fries as well!
mixture of pork sausages, smoked paprika, cherry tomato coulis, creamed baby spinach, eggs, cheddar cheese, toast
Good food on a nice Saturday afternoon. Eggs were perfectly poached. Wrapped in bacon with some melted cheese on top. Nested on bread with lots of yummy minced mushroom. Nicely executed dish.
Look at the title (I\'m a super fussy eater so I don\'t usually rave about anything), I personally think this rendition is even better than stranger\'s reunion waffles. Banana, strawberry, peanut butter, hazelnut choclate, maple syrup, Chantilly cream and blueberry ice cream with thick slices of Belgian waffles ($14). I can\'t really describe this and you have to try it yourself! Yummy~
Forget about wild honey, this is now second on my list and Skyve still crowning it. Really love the food here that I can make do with the pricing (it\'s overpriced), noisy and mediocre ambience. Ordered the eggs sur le plat ($24) this was the bomb! Think runny eggs, tomato, spinach and chorizo sausages with a thick slice of brioche. It was heavenly albeit a little salty. It can get a little too much or gelat for one but because I enjoy eating rich food I\'m fine with it. Great place for brunch if you\'re feeling rich but please do make reservation to avoid waiting. 
This is mind blowing, all the goodness in one plate. ($24) brioche toast, maple glazed bacon( this was really yummy), scrambled eggs, hash brown, mesclun and sautéed mushrooms. Too yummy we wolfed it down. Will be back (only for food) not the perfect place if you\'re looking to chill here, it\'s too noisy. For me it\'s a eat and go kinda place.
You know where this coffee belongs to by the look of that cute gingerbread man.☺️
$17 for a big bucket of fries which taste awesome is definitely worth it. Comparable with Au Chocolate and portion is slight more. Service is good too. Enjoyed the ambience of the cafe. Though alittle pricey for the food at such a location.
Be engulfed with darkest and surround yourself with broad range of indie and alternative music. This cafe will certainly provide that hipster feel. And their Hot Chocolate was beyond phenomenal. Prices: 2/5 (quite pricey) Services: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4.5/5 
$15 - so I\'m eating alone and overordered. This giant bucket of truffle-infused fries is pretty good.
Brunch in this brick-walled space is always a lovely affair, from the ambience to the well-executed food. Favourites include the Flan ($23), pork cheek confit with sauteed mushrooms, a perfectly poached egg, and a mountain of rocket sitting in a light pastry shell. The truffle fries are so delightful, it\'s worth popping by anytime you\'re in the neighborhood! Finish off with their decadent waffles. Photo by Jennifer Yeo
A nice cozy place to chill. Likewise for the food is normal. Shall try it\'s brunch next time. Overall ⭐️⭐️

You can\'t say you went to symmetry if you didn\'t order their truffle fries! So far it\'s the best truffle fries I had till date until I cover the places I have in mind 😋 
One of the best truffle fries tasted. The strong aroma of truffle on it is so good. 👍 
Accessible location by bus/walk (Lavender/Bugis Mrt). Their brunch menu is only served during weekends or public holidays. Price is S$18+ onwards for their mains. Loved the truffle fries (not too truffly) and i enjoyed the apricot duck croissant! 
One of the most refreshing orange juices that I have ever had.
This is what happens when Symmetry puts a spin on the well-known classic, the Rocky Road. Two scoops of Triple Chocolate ice-cream are dressed with spiced crumble (not unlike a smashed up gingerbread man), chunks of mixed berries jelly, cherries, minuscule dark chocolate balls and itsy-bitsy marshmallows. Each time your spoon goes into the bowl, it scoops up a different combination of all that yumminess. It\'s nice being slightly surprised with every bite.
This is sublime. You know you\'re getting very fresh fish because there is nowhere to hide with this style of cooking. Even with a strong supporting cast of capers, almond slices, lemon confit and butter sauce, the snapper is clearly the star. Nothing outshines it. I just wish the portion was bigger. 
Bite-sized portions of ultra-smooth mashed potato with honey glazed ham and cheese playing hide-and-seek in there, are coated in a light batter before being deep fried to give a thin crunchy coating. I couldn\'t stop popping these into my mouth especially after dipping them in the accompanying (I\'m making a wild guess here) berry yogurt sauce.
Stack of waffles with mixed berries compote, peanut butter, chocolate hazelnut, maple syrup, chantilly cream and blueberry ice cream ($16).
Still the best Truffle Fries in Singapore IMO!
Symphonically complex coffee aroma with a light silky mouthfeel. Flavor saturates a crisply, sweet resonant finish. 
On the 2nd day of CNY the cafe is full. Is tradition evolving? #singapore #cafe
A new beginning of 2014 with the first brunch and our first visit to Symmetry. We ordered their recommended dish Symmetry Egg Sur Le Plat($24), Flan($24), Crispy Baby Squid($17), Waffle($16). Like what the waitress say, u dun Flan anywhere outside, so why not give it a try... 
Having Symmetry\'s damn good truffle fries and chilling out at Artistry with Sweden\'s number one cider! What an awesome way to complete our night!
Lovely place to hang out, love the decorations &amp; music played! Kinda disappointed that they don\'t serve breakfast all day (we went there for it) but two thumbs up for the Xmas brunch. $22
See that metal straw? We call it the stir-aw. Hahahah. Come down and try their #coffee to find out why ;) @symmetrysg #punny
Already known for their great brunch items, such as their Flan (which you should get before these waffles), Symmetry also nails the waffle. At $14, bananas, strawberries, peanut butter, hazelnut chocolate, maple syrup and vanilla ice cream sit atop crispy, fluffy waffles. Get an extra scoop of blueberry ice cream for a near-perfect dish!

so much variety in a big breakfast! the best one i\'ve had at brunch!
gingy can\'t resist the smell of freshly roasted beans from his latte bath tub
Scrumptious eggs sur le plat, with a delicious flowy egg in a paprika-spiced piquillo puree and a smooth green tea latte to go along with it. My sunday is complete
My conclusion after 3 visits: only order the truffle fries. Crab pasta and mocha are big no-nos. 
T.O.M.A.T.O.E.S
Pork cheek pasta with creme fraiche 
Popcorn Prawn this my second time eating this amuse! 
The best truffle fries to start off the night!
So good I foresee major cravings for this in the weeks to come. My favourite kind of fries: not too crispy, soft. Goes perfectly with the truffle mayo. $14, 5/5
Who says no to desserts like this? Eat first then say 🙊
Cally\'s yummy lunch #burpple
Sauce a bit too creamy for my liking but the mushroom is very generous and spaghetti well cooked. Worth a try 
Oozy gooey goodness
Finally tried Symmetry after hearing so many good reviews. The poached eggs are perfecto! Portion of fries is big and delish too, with fish meat that\'s so soft with crispy outer skin. And the banana chocolate milkshake is to die for!! #yum
Waffles are my kind of brunch. All of fluffy, fragrant and frivolously beautiful. Can sunday get any better? #foodporn #waffles @jonahwongofficial @caihonglim
Very sweet chai latte that they promised to tweak. The brunch here is exceptional though!
The flan x Truffle eggs and rosti. What\'s not to love about this two plates of goodness?! Probably the price. Not many places serve great food and coffee altogether, but this place deserves extra brownie points for delivering both well. The last of weekday brunches for me🍴
This is sooo yummy. \n<br />Poach eggs with spinach (my fav), sausages, carrots in tomato based sauce in a hot pan. #symmetryeggs #symmetry #brunch
The meat is very tender!! Will definitely be back for more.....slurps....
Truffle fries, mushroom soup, waffles, flat white, chai latte and hot chocolate. All for 2. Tad overpriced. Love the interior though!
A spoonful of extra #pb to make it all go down!! So decadent!😛
The truffle fries &amp; beef tartare were really yummy. We polished them off in a jiffy. Perhaps that raised our expectations too high for the mains that followed didn\'t impress. The beef shirt ribs were decent enough but the chicken, pork-cheeks pasta &amp; duck leg were kinda disappointing. Dessert-candied orange-was redeeming if u are a lover of dark choc as I am. It was rich with a perfect balance of sweet &amp; bitter. 
Best hot chocolate i\'ve ever drank thus far. Lovin\' the mini burnt marshmallows☕ #foodporn #brunch
Today I murdered two more eggs. These were found lying motionless on spicy chorizo, bacon and a pile of mashed potato. I just had to do it.
Great aroma and smoothness of the coffee. Gingerbread man was too adorable to eat.
Always love the brunch menus at Symmetry. The crowd, not so much.
Among all the eggs, this is my favourite!!! Portobello Benedict... so nice &amp; yummy!!! #brunch #foodporn
Definitely one of my favs! Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com #sgfood #foodporn
58 hours braised short rib steak x cranberry x parsnip x baby spinach x black truffle jus x fries! so tender and yummy :D
Poached eggs with yummy mash x bacon x spicy chorizo x mesclun x toast &amp; jam!
Slightly sweet for my liking but the burnt marshmallows were interesting
Love it when the poached eggs are done to perfection!  but the best thing on this plate is the strawberry jam! It was creamy and smooth and not too sweet- definitely the first time I actually liked jam.
Sunday brunch. And happy to have enjoyed a good cup of coffee today. 😊✨
12-hour braised. With potatoes, watercress and brown butter emulsion. My second favourite dish of the night! It was super satisfying, tender and tastyyy.
Compressed baby carrots #burpple
Signature Hamburger with beef patty, foie gras, chorizo, beetroot relish, and mornay sauce. Who\'s in for a 🍔 glamour shot challenge? 😂
Baby Lamb Ribs with char grilled eggplants and grana padano! 🐑🐏
12-hour braised beef short ribs, with watercress and potatoes in brown butter emulsion! 🐮
Bad lighting and picture quality! Nevertheless, pretty neat presentation of the Portobello Soup! 🍲
Spatchcock, 🐔 otherwise known as \"spattlecock\" is also called juvenile chicken! 🐓 We were all wondering why this bird is so huge in size? 😳
No Captions! Please fill in your own blanks! 😂✌
Truffle Fries! A must order at Symmetry! 🍟
Scallops with cauliflower, chives, kelp dust, almond, bacon, tomatoes, and chlorophyll!
I think this is called Bulgur 🍀 Cranberries, hazelnut, creme fraiche, spring onions and quinoa!
Rachel, the Hungry Duchess Vampire! 👻 Don\'t stare at her mouth! Stare at her nails! 💅
Candied Orange #burpple
Lamb Shoulder? #burpple
Tomatoes with Burrata, basil, honey olive emulsion! 🍅
Tuna with goat curd cheese, mint, green pea and affila cress! 🐟
this was so mind-boggling in many ways
Portobello mushroom soup~ #burpple
i love beef!!! so this is good for me :)
Food is of high importance, of course... but first everyone whips out our burppling \'gadget\' (we even have our own lighting crew!) ;) Great company, great food! Thanks Jayne for organising this.
the skin was really crisp! i like mutton and i enjoyed this!
Scallops nom nom #burpple
the goat cheese was an interesting twist
love this!
Really like how the texture turned out, it was thick, yoghurt-like, yet not overwhelming. 
pardon the poor shot; this was really nice!
Truffle Fries #burpple
this woke me up. i had a super tiring day, and the ginger/orange/black tea mix was quite refreshing! ginger\'s a bit strong though so avoid this if that\'s not your cup of tea
Candied Orange Dessert! 🍊 Honey comb, orange zest and caramel, with dark chocolate sorbet! 😋
Rock Melon Trifle! 🍈 Mint custard, melon coulis jelly and midori granite!
Guanaja Mousse dessert! Peanut butter sable, with caramelized bananas and malt dust! 😋
The damage we did last night! #burpple 😁✌

Wild mushrooms with parsley sauce on the side.
Truffle fries! A bucket full of it too ;)
Having afternoon snacks with some of our lovely Burpplers, Jennifer and Alain. It\'s been a fun afternoon of coffee coffee food food eat eat drink drink. These truffle fries were nice and crispy with good amount of truffle flavor. Can\'t stop eating. 
Wonderful portions. Delicious truffle flavor. Can\'t stop eating. Help.
Not a huge fan of the greens, but this really wasn\'t that bad!
Nothing special but the cafe was sweet to ask if I want just red apples or prefer a mixed of the red &amp; green.. Which was a nice touch...
The egg were well done n the bacon n bread were delish... I have a small problem locating the place mainly due to the structure of the street.. 
If only every Friday was like this.. Lovely brunch, lovely weather and with my love!
Best environment ever. Quiet, chill and lovely music. Totally in love with this place.
Pasta was exchanged w/o additional cost or questions. Prawn popcorn &amp; fried squids were delish! 👍
Counting down... the last 4th day. Celebrate with a Mango Sandwich!

And I always get a pretty one from Christian.
Worth the 15-min wait to taste the coconut cookie ice cream, pineapple compote. 🍮\n<br />#burpple
Very special way of presenting frangelico mascarpone cream, affogato ice cream, sponge finger, slayer espresso jelly, crispy chocolate pearls! First mouthful was delightful and I enjoyed this dessert\n<br />🍬\n<br />#burpple
Indeed the ribs were superly soft when you sliced it through. Love the taste of brown sugar &amp; wine that lifted the taste of this delectable dish\n<br />🐄\n<br />#burpple
One word for this dish: Yummy! The chicken was surprising tender and the combination of all the ingredients were well balanced\n<br />🐥\n<br />#burpple
Hooray, finally found the taste of wonderful Burrata Cheese that I missed so much at Italy!\n<br />🧀\n<br />#burpple
Indeed very rich with truffle taste &amp; very crispy! But for such a smaller portion during dinner, I must say the price is pretty steeeeeeeep 😂\n<br />🍟\n<br />#burpple
The drinks were $14-$16 though they were pretty nice. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Well, not really symmetrical to me. Total damage: $24 + $10 (Berry Smoothie). An expensive brunch once in awhile to pamper my little tummy. \n<br />#burpplesg #burpple #sgfood #sgcafe #bunch #bugis #selfpampering #onceinawhile
Forgot to post the lovely truffle eggs I had that day. Honestly, one of the best I\'ve tried and the consistency brings me back every time. :)
It\'s a little overpriced to me though\n<br />🔹\n<br />It was a pre-dinner coffee session before a meeting, we decided to go for something light and fast so my col ordered this from the snacks menu. It\'s not a good choice to me as I don\'t really take raw without alcohol 😆, it\'s kind of waste to me especially when come to dishes with beef and sashimi. Moreover, I have an instinctive antipathy towards the taste of rémoulade (it\'s similar to mustard mayo). Anyway, my col manage to empty the bowl with only good comment left over, no food was wasted\n<br />🔹\n<br />Hot chocolate with torched marshmallow, sweetness overdosed, it\'s good for me to stick to my White Flat, a well balanced cup\n<br />🔹\n<br />#beeftartar #beefremoulade #remoulade #symmetrysg #hotchocolatemarshmallow #predinnersnack #antipathy #eatoutsg #topcitybites #topsingaporerestaurants #instafood_sg #sgcafefood #exsgcafes #exploresingaporecafes #hungrygowhere #burpple #sgmakandiary #myfab5 #singaporecafe #sglifestyle #atethefood #foodiegram #foodpornsg #foodstagrammer #sgfoodies #foodloversg #styleonfood
I love the mix of the very thinly sliced green asparagus\n<br />🍴\n<br />The dish came with a sense of thoughtfulness, meticulously condimented before it presented to us.

Amazing egg benedict! 10/10
Its brightness and radiance though stands out easily from the rockets nestled on top and the smashed avocados gleefully blanketed between the greens and the salmon gravalax - cured in salt, sugar and dill (aromatic herb of the parsley family). Indulge in all these with the artisanal toast for a really hearty breakfast
But very well plated ones makes me go over the moon.
The poached eggs are smooth and gooey and its melt in your mouth texture complements the rest of the ingredients perfectly

Always thick and perfect. Iced-coffee perfection. You can catch them at this week\'s @sgcoffeefest as well. They serve up amazing coffee and really good food as well. Check them out! #coffee #icedlatte #latte #presentation #sgcoffee #sgcoffeefest #cafe #cafes #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg
Must try!
The batter used must be made in heaven! Freshly fried till light and crisp, it is served with black pepper aioli, an unusual combination, but spicy just the way I like it to be. Don\'t eat this with beer please, it\'s fine on its own. Forget etiquette and work your jaws through each crunch like a wolf. I could feel the sea breeze, hear crashing waves, and howl happily under the moon light.... #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #burpple #sgcafes #cafehopping #cafesg #sg #sgfoodtrend #sgcafehopping #igsg #sgcafefood #instafood #cafehoppingsg #cafes #Singapore #whati8today #sgig #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #foodstagram #sgfooddiary #instafoodsg #foodgasm #SGMakanDiary #ginpala #eatbooksg #symmetry #singaporeinsiders #symmetrycafe

$15 on potato fries with truffle oil emulsion
This comes in substitute of fried baby squids on the menu. But a pleasant surprise nonetheless.

Pretty addictive fries - rich with truffle oil and fried to golden perfection.

Great eggs Benedict and coffee 
$16. Part of their Monday menu, this is a gorgeous waffle served with praline,pumpkin coconut custard, marshmallow, elderberries gel and vanilla ice cream. Thought it tasted pretty good altogether with sweetness from vanilla ice cream crunchy texture from the praline and aroma of coconut. Couldn\'t decide if we liked this or artistry\'s better😅

Very filled brekkie 👍
Tastes kind of fruity. 
It was a hearty brunch! Love the berries butter that compliments the toast. Coffee was good too.
it would be way better had de bacons been more crispy. a great way to start de mornings. \n<br />happy hump day yall.
according to @alainlicious its at symmetry. \n<br />prefer fork or hands ?
Yummy though it could be less soggy #foodporn #foodgasm #instafood #instagood #burpple
today I had smoked pancetta pork with scrambled eggs.
Another cuppa, pulled by barista Chris. The flavours were bold and the temperature was on point. Definitely recommend this cafe for your daily dosage of caffeine.
A few stacks of waffle comes along with a scoop of honeycomb ice cream and topped up with a few selection of fillings (Nutella, Peanut Butter &amp; Berries Jam) as side dips. 
A very hearty and well-balanced plate of waffles. The spongy waffles, ice cream, raspberry, nutella and peanut butter all in one. They are the simple elements that makes my day.

Poor services. Alright food. Nice shakes. Hipster ambience.
Crispy. Mix berries compote, peanut butter, chocolate hazelnut, maple syrup, chanting cream, and pretty amazing blueberries ice cream.
Simply delicious! Worth going back for more

[Waffles - mix berries compote, peanut butter, chocolate hazelnut, maple syrup, chantilly cream, blueberry ice cream S$16] 👍👍👍
Snapper which was surprisingly good &amp; appetizing.
New coffee bean that Yve carried back from Australia, Proud Mary.
😍😍😍😍 Lovely egg ben and truffle fries 🍟🍳
Hot Chocolate with Marshmellow. Price - don\'t care. Rating - don\'t care. I\'m here to talk about their COFFEE. It looked like any regular latte with swan latte art but the contents, oh holy mother of food, is so freaking good. It\'s the best tasting coffee I\'ve ever had since my return from Australia and I\'m addicted to the drug already, craving for it every single waking moment. GO VISIT SYMMETRY NOWWWWWWWW. #food #foodminions #drinks #coffee #chocolate #cocoa #marshmallow #symmetry #bugis #singapore #cafe #latte #latteart #awesome #yummy #love #fujifilmx100s #snapseed
Bacon &amp; Cheese Rissoles S$16. Rating: 5/5. Shut up and take my money! It\'s good but pricey. In fact, everything from this cafe is pricey. I guess you\'re paying for the little moments of happiness from their food and AWESOME coffee. #food #foodminions #snacks #symmetry #cafe #bugis #bacon #cheese #oniondip #applecider #awesome #love #yummy #fried #balls #snapseed #fujifilmx100s

It\'s #Symmetry\'s 58hour braised beef ribs 🐮 Drool please #foodporn #foodoftheday #singapore #nofilter
Unimpressed with the fact that they were out of their short ribs and burger buns, which they substituted with ciabatta. The dish itself was a little bland
Much welcomed after a super long and busy week!

Hamburger
do not be deceived by the name. there is so much in this hamburger that it left me confused. i felt that there was just too much in this, the whole mix of foie gras, beef, beet root and what have you was a bit too overwhelming for me
