With different stores and food choices opening at different times of the day.. the place never fails to attract hungry stomachs. Tried a different carrot cake store this time (on the same lane as the famous He Zhong), it impressed us even more with its uniquely homemade chilli paste and a crispy outer layer that comes with each chunks of carrot cake served. Big $4 portion for two of us to share!! Would highly recommend it if you observe an \'invisible\' queue at He Zhong, to my opinion, this is even better!
Out of the 3 dishes which we have order. This was the most disappointing. Despite being charcoal grilled, it totally lacks of the barbecued fragrant. Chilli sauce was neither complementing the wings.
Perfect for this cold rainy weather! Hot mutton soup with choice of mixed mutton (meat, stomach and tendon), tendon soup, mutton ball soup. We ordered the basic mutton (meat only) soup, which tastes great with strong mutton fragrant! The portion was quite small though.
Although I prefer the latter over the former, this He Zhong carrot cake stall (#02-185) makes some tasty white carrot cake that keeps me reaching out for another mouthful.\n<br />-\n<br />Stir fried to a slight char, the carrot cake (locally also known as chai tow kway) here carries a hint of smokiness while still retaining the moisture and softness. The generous chye poh (aka preserved radish) is crunchy and adds more flavours to this savoury dish. Definitely one of the better contestants around IMO!\n<br />-\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #tastytastemaketour
Opened by the people behind @woonwoonpekbeehoon ! @freshgenerationseafoodsoup can be found in Bukit Timah market and food centre to satisfy your seafood craving with yummy Australian lobsters ! Original, authentic taste of seafood soup at an affordable price ü¶êü¶êü§§
I love their bouncy fishballs and large slices of fishcake. Simple yet delicious. This was the larger portion at $4. So glad to be living near this food paradise.
My favorite was the Ngoh Heong üòòSuper love the bouncy chewy sotong &amp; the not-at-all-oily crispy fried cracker üòã\n<br />Next love of mine was the crunchy chye poh in the moist carrot cake üòçSatay bee hoon was good but I would prefer the satay sauce to be thicker &amp; with tiny bits of crunchy peanuts üòúShock of the day for me was MILT (fish sperm) in the fish soup üò±Surprising it tasted ok &amp; the texture was not as powdery as I imagine it to be. A pleasant 1st try for me &amp; so was the squid eggs &amp; fish eggs ü§ó
Assorted muffins (buy 5 get 1 free, $6)
From Selera Hidayah which is a rather new stall that opened in recent months. While it did look appetizing, it could have fared better if the condiments were prepared in smaller batches ‚Äî the sunny side up was left there for a while, and the Chicken Wing would have been really good if it\'s served warm (it\'s still pretty crisp, but the temperature really made a difference). The rice carries a light, fluffy texture though felt like the plot was lost without being as coconut-y as expected. That being said, the chili really helped to ante up the entire plate; overall not too spicy and carries a balance of sweetness ‚Äî definitely made it easier to finish it all.
Who says tze char is only good for dinner? You can have it for lunch too when you\'re at Bukit Timah Food Centre! 
Trying the Beef Hor Fun from 168 Beef Hor Fun &amp; White Bee Hoon w/Clams for the first time and thought this was actually a decent eat in the food Centre ‚Äî preferred this to their white bee hoon. While there wasn\'t much wokhei toy mention and that the Hor Fun was a bit clumpy, the flavourful sauce and chewy noodles do help to make it rather palatable. The beef slices were a little inconsistent; some chewier than the rest but generally weren\'t too veiny or excessively fatty. Quite a decent item to try at $5 if you are looking for something new to try here.
last weekend\'s morning spread with @burpple and #burppletastemakers at bukit timah food centre. we convene to eat the good to find the better so as to bring you the best. \"burpple tastemakers guide - bukit timah\" coming real soon #burpplebtfc
Eats Update: Bukit Timah Hawker will be closed for renovation, starting from tomorrow (9 Oct 2017) onwards.
They cook with charcoal which is rarely seen these days especially in Singapore, so be prepared to wait for at least 20mins. Oil and Soy sauce is provided. This one is pretty good, but the one at Golden Mile Food Centre is better IMO, for $6 no less. Definitely still satisfying. \n<br />#burpple
The first time I have to eat in Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre for this semester and decided to try 168 Beef Hor Fun and White Bee Hoon w/ Clams (not to be confused with Prosperity White Bee Hoon which faces the stairs leading to the food centre) ‚Äî this stall replaces the Cantonese Hor Fun stall that I never fail to patronize every week for the whole of last semester. Everything is served in a single size, and every item on the menu costs $5.
Got mushroom, mince meat, mince meat ball, mince meat fried dumpling, fish ball, fish cake, lots of chilli and vinegar with Mee Pok. The \"favouritetest\" BCM near home. Only order when the \"old man\" is there. Lol. The others mix of sauces can\'t make it and noodles also a tinge overdone.
From Prosperity White Bee Hoon, a rather new stall at the above-mentioned food centre.
One last go at the meatballs (probably) from Èô≥ÂõõÂ∞ë Cantonese Hor Fun; uncle said he would continue business for a week more. Definitely can\'t get over these meatballs that are crisp, meaty and chunky with chestnuts to crunch and fermented bean paste for that slight hint of umami flavour. Maybe one more round next week perhaps?
Probably the last time I am going to have the Cantonese Hor Fun here ‚Äî uncle told me that this week would be his last week of operations before closing down for good. Today\'s Hor Fun gravy is a tad bland as compared to the usual standard, but I guess anything would work so long I get to have those huge, crisp and chunky meatballs again one last time ...
And indeed, their Hor Fun is not oily and not salty.\n<br />üç≤\n<br />The typical Hor Fun is served with sliced meat, fish cake and seafood in a sticky &amp; savory broth. But this Hor Fun has a more watery broth and something a little different- deep fried homemade meat balls! üç≤\n<br />While I would have preferred a little more seasoning on the XL meatballs to cover the slight porky taste, I appreciated that they are freshly fried upon order so they are hot and crispy! In any case, ask for more chilli to dip the meatballs in and they will be perfect!\n<br />üç≤\n<br />The boss helming the stall is also very friendly and nice. Good food, cheap price, healthier choice and good service. Nothing more I could ask for! @the_xw Thanks for the recommendation! üòã\n<br />üç≤\n<br />ÈôàÂõõÂ∞ëCantonese Hor Fun\n<br />51 Upper Bukit Timah Road, Bukit Timah Market and Cooked Food Centre #02-168 S588215\n<br />Sun to Fri: 8.30am to 7.30pm, Sat: Closed (Timing stated is a rough guide and is subjected to changes)
Crispy Bak Skin! The stall also lists out why it is a healthier snack! Hahahhahaha. Seen at #BukitTimah Food Centre.
Located at Bukit timah food centre, the queue is long and the beancurd is really smooth and not too sweet (and thats good). I think it is freshly made. Cost $1.50, if i live near the area i would gladly nom this anytime. #BurppleCheapNGood
Penang Laksa from the stall at Bukit Timah Market that only sells 1 item - Penang Laksa. Today like got less fish, the gravy is good though.
The dumplings were fried on the spot and was crispy on the outside, filling and tasty on the inside. It comes with mushrooms and also topped with strips of crispy wanton skins as well!
From a new stall at Bukit Timah Market &amp; Food Centre named Cantonese Hor Fun which sells a variety of Hor Fun dishes with thinner noodles than the typical local dishes Hor Fun ‚Äî the type you would expect from Ipoh Hor Fun. This stall emphasizes on less sugar, less salt, no MSG ‚Äî more suited for the health-conscious as the gravy itself is pretty light; subtly savoury without leaving an aftertaste and is very starchy as it laces the slurpy rice noodles with its thickness. Strips of crisp wanton skin gives it a little texture, but ultimately the attraction of the dish for me lies in the handmade meat balls; very chunky with a meaty bite and contains bits of chestnut that gives it the crunchiness within that\'s probably gonna make you finish all the meatballs first. The stewed Shiitake Mushrooms also felt really fresh, bouncy and absorbs the Hor Fun gravy very well as every bite sends a little bit of gravy seeping out of it ‚Äî doesn\'t quite feel like that sort of rubbery, dried mushrooms that some places might use. If you want to get the best of all worlds, consider ordering the $5 PKL Hor Fun ‚Äî just $1.50 more from the other Hor Fun dishes and you get a combination of all items such as fried wanton, fried dumplings, the stewed Shiitake, Wanton Skin, Handmade Meatballs and Shredded Chicken all in a bowl with the Hor Fun which is pretty much seals the deal if you are hungry or just want to try everything in one bowl.
From Ah Zhen Wanton Mee at Bukit Timah Market &amp; Food Centre; relatively new and seemed to have opened during my school holidays because it seemed a tad unfamiliar to me. For $3, you get quite a lot with thick cuts of Char Siew, two soup wanton and two fried wanton. A very average plate of Wanton Mee you will get here ‚Äî perhaps only made appealing because of the lack of any other Wanton Mee option around this food centre. The noodles seemed to be inadequately drained and carried a little alkaline flavour though the chili and sauce did help to make it more manageable and much less detectable. The other ingredients were pretty average ‚Äî generic dyed Char Siew warmed in a home-use electric steamer, wanton that seemed to carry more skin than meat. It\'s that sort of survivable hawker fare considered when you are in need for a quick lunch and don\'t have the time to queue.
Been reading up on recommended food places in HK and I am getting excited for next week\'s trip! \n<br />This was last Saturday\'s local breakfast. My first time trying Chinese rojak (S$6), and I actually like this better than the traditional Indian rojak because it feels less oily and lighter. \n<br />Then I came to know that it\'s because Chinese Indian rojak is fried in vegetable oil whilst Indian rojak is fried in ghee. \n<br />I also kinda like the sweet Thai Chilli-like sauce dip.
This plate of carrot cake costs $2, today. Singapore\'s inflation average at more than 2.5% pa but the price of this carrot cake at Bukit Timah Market has remained unchanged. I think about their finances, the impact of inflation on them at two levels. First, costs of ingredients and rental has went up. Second, the same income received (assuming sales is as robust as before) has to be used to pay for necessities and lifestyle at increased cost. Yet they maintained their prices. I certainly hope we continue patronising our hawkers, sustain their income and keep our local food alive - they are very much our heritage. Let\'s #uncagestreetfood.
Finally almost fully recovered from my wisdom tooth surgery last week HOORAY! Been craving for a simple plate of economic bee hoon and I can finally enjoy it peacefully without chewing in pain. The kway teow here\'s slightly more oily but the bee hoon is just nice. Overall a decent plate that satisfied my cravings! Now I just need to get a cup of homemade ice lemon tea. Feeling so good! 
While it lacks the wok hei and the strong prawn flavour, the chilli is kicking well and the portion is satisfying. I would prefer more yellow noodle and less white ones though.
$3.50 for a generous portion of penang laksa that same or even better found in penang...soup is thick filled with chunks of fish...thumbs up..stall at level 2 known as signature laksa...
The Aunty will line the styrofoam container with foil before putting the food on it. This is Pork Cutlet with 3 sides from Peter Pan at Bukit Timah Food Centre.
I think I should visit Kuching to calibrate the tastebuds. Haha....
I\'ll start with He Zhong Carrot Cake. It is dubbed by many as the best in the West, and I\'m now proudly one of those many. It is mind blowing! The perfect texture and taste balance, from the sweetness of the scrambled egg to the savoury carrot cake, I could feel my stomach getting full, yet my mouth could not stop chomping on this amazing food! If overeating is a sin, I\'d gladly spend my afterlife in purgatory just for this cake.
From a stall named Teochew Minced Pork Noodles at the abovementioned food centre. While the fried dumplings were crisp with ample fillings, the noodles were subpar; rather bland and quite oily, leaving your lips smacking of oil. Not quite my type of noodles.
Value for money black carrot cake selling at $2. Available at $2.50 &amp; $3 too. Find it at 134 Carrot Cake stall:) Tasty ! 
From a stall named Soylicious at the abovementioned food centre. I have always preferred warm soy beancurd, though I am fine with the cold \"Lao-Ban\" styled variant if it isn\'t available. Totally impressed with this for they seemed to got all the boxes checked; a sugar syrup that is sweet and gives ample sweetness to the beancurd without overwhelming the soy flavour of the beancurd, without leaving a nasty aftertaste. Even the beancurd hits the right notes; silken and smooth, requiring no effort to swallow. One of my favourite warm beancurd around for now!
The $0.50 Kway matched along well with the braised duck (would prefer them to be thicker) &amp; usual mix of bouncy small pork intestines, pork belly, fish cake &amp; egg; which were deliciously braised in a dark sauce. Guess this is one of those dishes that people either love or hate, but a true blue Singaporean like me grew up enjoying this with my grandmother ‚Äì certainly one of the local comfort food I‚Äôll definitely miss if I were to ever go for exchange.\n<br />Have a blissful Sunday people!
Not the best. Curry is watery and lack taste. But I must say the Prata is crispy enough. Not worth the price though. 
üòãüòãüòã Not only does food fill up my tummy, it brings me closer to nice people around every corner of Singapore. Besides enjoying delicious food, it is good to know people on a personal level rather than from the mouth of the others. More than often, we r guilty of judging of people based on rumors and gossips. But knowing people at a personal level gives us the insight of how ridiculous gossips and rumours can be. üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n<br />Anyway here is a latergram of some of the famous and delicious local delights found at Bukit Timah Food Centre. Which is your fav? My vote definitely goes to the carrot cake which is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with generous serving of eggsssssssüòçüòçüòç
$6 for this?! WAY TOO PRICEY! Though the item at the bottom of the bowl was so sweet and crunchy!! Tastes like the topping of Chwee Kweh without the oil . This dish is quite special as they use pandan leaves to cook their rice!
One stall has nicer satay, one stall has nicer sauce. Sigh... 3rd stall is 10 cents more expensive per stick, so people don\'t seem to want to order from that stall. Haha......
In celebration that #BukitTimah is 60 years old and Singapore is SG50 years old.
A late lunch after completing the tree top walk trail all the way to bukit timah natural reserve with my maternal family. Today our cousins\' conversation revolved around \"what your love language is\", \"the difference between saying this is vs this could be esp with children\". Since there were quite a few of us we could afford to have a bit of everything/sharing each\'s favorite local food that we could find here. \n<br />Thoughts: \"Happy to be spending time with my maternal family\" \"I like the Popiah here a lot\" \"Nothing like indulging after exercising with good company\" #Hawkerpedia 
4 munchies: One of the few hawker centres that serves a wide range of quality local food. I\'d highly recommend the carrot cake from He Zhong (ÂêàÁúæ) and pork satay from Yong Seng. This is what I call a hearty weekend family meal in Singapore.
Queue was really long so decided to try it but I thought it didn\'t taste that fantastic but it apparently is super tasty to many others! So it really depends on personal preference :)
Smooth &amp; sweet tapioca dessert, with coconut milk and drizzled with Gula Melaka. Yummy ! 
Smooth and sweet tapioca with coconut milk - especially when drizzled with gula Melaka - a delightful mix of taste! Yummy. 
Awesome green tea liu sha bao! Didn\'t know green tea would go with custard salted egg haha! Forgot to take note of the shop name üòÖ
Weekend is nearing, and it\'s X-Men: Days of Future Past Premier here in Singapore! Can\'t wait to watch it tonight(:
This is awesome stuff! Ipoh hor fun that comes with real crispy wanton dumplings. All for only $3. 
This stall here is  surprisingly run by my Uncle\'s Sworn Brother\'s son!
There are so many carrot cake stalls here. Anyone know which one\'s the best?
And the Ngoh Hiang\'s good, just slightly expensive. This platter\'s S$9.
It is important to cave in to your guilty cravings once in a while (or all the time).
Almost a decade since I\'ve visited this food center. Bustling crowds!\n<br />.
had Minced Meat Congee after run. $2.50 for quite a big bowl, and i added an egg for another $.50. youtiao or fried dough fritter was crispy! good eat, good eat! i forgot to note down the stall name sorry :/ #dinner #porridge #congee #youtiao #chinesefood #chinese #porkporridge

One of my fav places for Carrot Cake is Bt Timah Food Centre. Standard dropped but I am not complaining. Hard to get good ones around now!
Fave childhood dessert üçß

This stall had a long queue. Whilst standing in line, could feel the heat and perspiration formed on my forehead. The ventilation was so stifling. I told myself this better be worth queuing.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />The pinky sauce was pretty and sweet which I tried avoiding dunking in too often. Chilli sauce had an intense spicyness.

This is the kind of comfort food for the weekends mornings.\n<br />-\n<br />At this popular stall (#02-149) located in the bukit timah market &amp; food centre, I get the same satisfaction of fried ngoh hiang (‰∫îÈ¶ô, literally means ‚Äòfive spices‚Äô), but without the excessive grease or oil that usually comes with fried food.\n<br />-\n<br />A few favourite items here: the prawn crackers which is crispy and light, the fragrant ngoh hiang roll and the orange squid with a chewy texture that provides a good contrast to the rest which are mostly fried.\n<br />-\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #tastytastemakertour

You also have the option of the prawn, crayfish, flower crab or mixed seafood version. A generous plate of bee hoon in deep broth, topped with fresh slices of fish and sweet white cabbage. Tell me, what\'s not to love?

Other than the usual black CKT, we compared the white version at ËÄÅÂ§´Â≠ê (Old Airport Road FC) with the Penang CKT (Bukit Timah FC). With little surprise, both taste rather similar, both just a delicious. The keys were that Wok Hei, fresh ingredients and the subtle spiciness. Difference from the usual black ones would be the added sweetness from the black soya sauce which appeal to most. For me, these \"white\" versions were tastier. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #burpproved #ckt

Smooth, soft and fresh, the Cai Poh topping was also flavourful yet not salty or oily. \n<br />There are many repeated food stalls in this FC, such as BCM, carrot cake or Hokkien mee, but it is not difficult to find a few gems if u walk a few rounds.

It\'s not overly wet, but you can still taste the seafood in the gravy. The sotong is also cooked perfectly. \n<br />Don\'t forget the chilli if you love the spice! Not really spicy though, but complements the noodles really well. \n<br />Still looking for a fried prawn noodle that retains the pork belly though. But this one makes the mark for me! \n<br />#vscocam #vscofood #instafood #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #sgfood #hawker #hawkerfood #hawkersg #sghawker #bukittimahfoodcentre #prawnnoodles #hokkienmee #friedprawnnoodles #sotong #prawn #noodles #igsg #sgig #burpple #singapore
Feeling nostalgic as I tuck into my brunch dish - black carrot cake - a dish I grew up with, helping my grand dad on weekends at siglap market when i was a child. I enjoyed it for many years after when my godma took over the business, until she passed away a few years ago. I can still remember the flavors of the family carrot cake vividly, and most carrot cakes I have tasted since cannot, alas, match up to it. #jtbd #sgeats #yoursingapore #chyetowkway #carrotcake #burpple #hungryeats #epicureasia #bitessg

The cheapest carrot cake I found so far! For just $2.00, one can enjoy a hot plate of fried carrot cake stirred fried with sweet black sauce. It\'s really delicious. üòã\n<br />#fatdieme #foodiegram #foodstagram #bukitimahfoodcentre #carrotcake #chaitaokway #friedcarrotcake #blacksauce #localfood #localdelight #burpple
