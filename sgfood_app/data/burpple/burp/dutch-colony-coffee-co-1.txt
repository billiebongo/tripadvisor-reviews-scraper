This spacious cafe along Frankel Avenue is a popular meeting spot for many Easties, where there\'s ample space for you and your friends to catch up over light bites and great coffee. There\'s free WiFi here too, so if you\'re planning to get some work done, have the signature Flight Coffee ($8.50) ‚Äî a cappuccino served with a shot of espresso on the side ‚Äî it will keep you going for hours. Feeling peckish? Nibble on the Thai Milk Tea Loaf ($5) ‚Äî fragrant tea cake slathered with a luscious chayen sauce. 
Couldn\'t recall the name of this dish but here goes the review! Presentation of the food is really nice and picture worthy of course. However taste wise out of 5 would be a low 4 for me. I didn\'t really like the taste of the espresso and the bread doesn\'t have the soft texture. Would come back again to try the other stuff like their pancakes and pastries as well as for their ambience!
The subtle fragrance of the Thai milk tea in the cake plus the thickened milk tea sauce makes it a very interesting combination. Pair it with a cup of their coffee, made from their signature blend, grab a book, find a cosy space and you are all set for a fulfilling afternoon.
Amazed by the large selection of interesting tea selection available @dutchcolony, pictured here (served in a conical flask) is the Aromatherapy in a cup ($6) with strong notes of lavender and mint. The Signature Flight Coffee ($8.50) caught my interest which consist of a velvety Cappuccino and a Espresso shot. I had never had a pure espresso shot before and was very taken aback with the sourness of it! \n<br />However, I was quite dismay with the fact that their kitchen closes at 3pm daily (and they close at 8/10pm, no food till closing?!?!). There were plenty of bakes available like their Thai Milk Tea Loaf ($5) - subtle yet distinct flavours but wasn\'t fluffy enough for me :(
Located along Frankel Avenue, it can be a tad difficult to get there. I would say the trip down is worth it though! \n<br />The croissant ($10) I had for breakfast was toasted till warm, crisp with every bite, and generously paired with melted cheese and slices of ham. The portion of salad was disappointingly small, but otherwise went well with the dish. \n<br />Will be back to try their extremely instagram-able pancakes and bakes!
yesterday\'s triple shots to start the weekend right. i welcome you now weekend. i welcome you.
Surprisingly good actually! It\'s pretty light, not so much of your heavier NY cheesecakes, with a fairly distinct floral fragrance. Great with coffee!
Tried Chai tea, mocha and yogurt cheesecake. Ok taste. A bit expensive. Service is slow and staff made mistake with simple order. Good thing that you can sit quite long here. Good place to chat with friends. 
I liked the earl grey cheesecake. Found the chai latte too sweet 
Yet another savoury main at Dutch Colony that more than failed to impress. Their rendition of the breakfast platter comprised of buttered dry toast, mediocre sausage, supermarket-packaged ham, pecks of mushrooms and potatoes, and some raw veggies swimming in sweet dressing. The \"espresso baked eggs\" tasted nothing like espresso, and wrapped with turkey \'bacon\' the overcooked eggs lacked even that simple heartiness. Points for boasting variety, but when that isn\'t paired with quality I\'m afraid it\'s just not good enough.
Had a nice cup of cappuccino and chai tea latte w my buddy yesterday üòÅ
This Pannenkoeken of Dutch Colony\'s were disappointing to say the least. The hotcakes were dry, chewy and a tad dense, quite like a super dried up McDonald\'s hotcakes. The accompanying espresso butter was mild and underwhelming (using salted butter as a base might\'ve worked better) and the apple cinnamon sauce was nowhere to be found. Only saving grace was the maple syrup that tasted pretty real, which after the many processed sauces I\'ve had was indeed welcomed.
Their coffee are good! Try the iced chai latte which was refreshing and not too overpowering. Thai milk tea was dry and bland :(
Love the beetroot hummus and generous amount of smoked salmon. However the bagel was incredibly tough and difficult to cut through :(
The adorably named Wentelteefjes caught my eye, with promises of a delightful dish featuring espresso butter, fresh berries, and a special \'Dutch-styled\' French toast. Unfortunately it\'s nowhere as interesting as that. While the espresso butter was a cool touch, it did not melt well onto the French toast, ending up as just a mouthful of oily spread slapped onto each bite. The toast itself was dry and stiff, only acceptable when fully submerged in the accompanying maple syrup. The lovely ideas sadly did not translate. Clean up the execution, and we may just have a lovely brunch dish here.
[Dutch Colony Coffee Co.] On days like these, I would rather just be locked up in a cafe than be outdoors. One place that I don\'t mind going back is Dutch Colony, which is conveniently located near to home and accessible via a bus from the interchange.
I\'ve liked their Thai Milk Tea loaf since I first tried it earlier this year. A fragrant and moist tea cake topped with an assertively sweetened sauce and a simple crumble, this pairs really well with a cuppa black. Unfortunately several revisits taught me this first success may be accidental. The cake\'s annoyingly inconsistent, dry and tough on some days, flat and bland on others. If they could keep it consistent to my first visit I\'d be their biggest fan.
Rather crispy outer layer with soft and well mixed cheese and ham in the middle! The price there is within a affordable range of $5.50 to $15.
Dutch Colony is one of the places whereby you can get good food and coffee. Featuring here is Croque Monsieur ($10) with ham slices and thin cheese whereas the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich ($14) has pieces of dry teriyaki chicken on sourdough bread and a side of sweet potato fries.
[Dutch Colony Coffee Co.] Just two days to the Maroon 5 concert at the 2015 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix and I am getting all excited already. For F1 enthusiasts, they might be eagerly anticipating the race between Mercedes, Williams and Ferrari but mine is to catch Maroon 5 sing LIVE! Let\'s hope for good weather and the best spot to catch all the action on Saturday.
A really cozy environment for a catch up over a cup of brilliantly brewed konga coffee. 
Super super pretty cafe oh my PERFECT FOR A GOOD READ OVER A CUP OF COFFEE too bad the toasts was really rather average and boring to eat ‚òπ way too little sauce, toppings and all kinds of things to spice it up ‚òπ

Hunger has started its attack on the downtown belly.

Wide open spaces, lots of natural light, photo worthy furnishings and simple awesome fare. \n<br />The baked eggs are a hearty dish. Something warm that you\'ll love on a cold autumn morning with the breeze behind your back. Tangy tomato base, eggs, stringy cheese and fresh warm bread. All I need is a fire place and a book to snuggle my mornings away. \n<br />Monster don\'t wanna go home\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
We ordered the Espresso Bacon Baked Eggs with Wasabi Mayo &amp; Sweet Potato Truffle Fries. Eggs were slightly over cooked and yolk did not ooze as much as I would\'ve liked them to. Truffle fries were way too soggy. Lovely atmosphere and great lighting because of the glass roof. 
The Thai Milk Tea Loaf taste a tad dry and I would prefer a stronger Thai milk tea flavour. It might be too sweet for some, especially when eating with the condensed milk frosting. As for the Malt Cake, it\'s something forgettable. Perhaps more malted milk balls will help to improve the flavour.
Feeling tired and lazy on this Sunday afternoon? Luckily for this Thai Milk Tea Loaf ($5) and a cuppa of Flat White ($5) which made crawl out of bed and enjoy the final day of the weekends. The best part, I need not travel far for it. Coffee was excellent as usual but I would wish for more of the milk tea sauce on the cake.

It\'s a high raved place about their coffee. Their usual beast was down today so I tried their hand brewed coffee (it\'s my first) and boy, I\'m glad I tried it. I\'ll never look at coffee the same way ever again. It was so good! I also had the Thai milk tea loaf ($5), it was a little too sweet for my liking but not jelak of it. I\'ll definitely be back, their coffee game is damn strong. And if you like quaint, do try popping by on a weekday afternoon. 
A heady scent of tea leaves comes through the sponge, with a thick, sticky, slightly crusty chayen icing lending a good amount of sweetness.. Pair with a cuppa and you\'re ready to conquer
The weekends are so close that I can almost taste it üòã! I will be having a 2 weeks \"break\" away from work as I don the green uniform for a yearly affair. Before that, let\'s look forward to the weekends and have a slice of the Thai Milk Tea Cake ($5) from Dutch Colony Coffee Co. which complements a cup of Flat White ($5) perfectly. However, it would be better if there\'s more of that heavenly Thai Milk Tea sauce on my cake because the cake gets a bit too dry once the sauce runs out. Nonetheless, Dutch Colony Coffee Co. is a very relaxed, chill-out place to have a seriously good cup of coffee and cakes.
Much loves üòç
their Thai milk tea loaf was definitely something I\'ll eat everyday I loaf it üòçüòçüòç thickened milk tea sauce + subtle fragrance of the moist tea cake means perfection. heard that their coffee is pretty good as well, definitely worth a visit esp for my east side friends! atmosphere\'s pretty good for a chill afternoon too 
Have always love this place. I can see myself visiting this place on a regular basis if I stay in that area. Why do I stay so far away?? Yep a nice place to hang out, with good coffee and space. 
Located in the quiet neighbourhood of kembagan, i went early on a saturday and were one of the first few customers there. But the place was packed within 2hrs into operation. Its ambience with natural lighting through the glass roof is 10/10 for good pictures. The food is not bad, though it is not the best I\'ve tasted.. the bagel is cold and too hard, the toast is better and imo, coffee is the best for this brunch. Items featured in the picture includes: The signature Wentelfeejes $10/Smoked salmon bagelwich $11/Cafe mocha $5.50/Signathure Flight Coffee $8.50. Verdict: I won\'t come here for brunch again, but more for their coffee and cakes. (tried their Strawberry matcha &amp; thai milk tea cakes too, and it was good, especially the milk tea oneüòç) 3.90/5.0.
We had the Espresso Bacon Baked Eggs with Wasabi Mayo ($11), Signature Wentelteefjes ($10) and Flat White ($5). Love the ambience here which is similar to the cafes in Aussie.
The sweet potato fries that came along with the sandwich were absolutely delicious, albeit a little too oily. Not too shabby a meal that costed $14, and for the chill atmosphere too.
served freshly roasted bean with various brewing methods with its great selection of quality coffee beans from different part of the world.
Prices for the food were decent. Good ambience but tends to get a little warm in the afternoon, thanks to the glass ceiling. Do order before 11am if you are looking for brunch food, to avoid disappointment. Sweet potato fries were soggy. My favourites are the baked eggs and the thai milk tea loaf cake (served warm!)
Overcooked meagre slices of steak, cloyingly sweet caramelized onions, and super sweet (I think honey) mustard sauce, atop a Gardenia equivalent slice of wholemeal bread. 
Bread was quite hard and over-toast but all the flavors infused together was nothing but shiok. Thai Milk Tea Cake was something new but too sweet for me, however the bits of tea bites are very interesting! 
Throwback to a Sunday some weeks ago. In reality, I\'m snuggled up in my comforter in bed catching up on the latest episodes of Masterchef AU ‚Äì season 7 just started!
hope it\'s not all doom and gloom on ur faces today.
Imagine a pound cake infused with heavily sweetened Thai milk tea. If you\'re in need a sugar/caffeine boost to drag you out of a mid-day slump, this ought to do the trick.
There is no denying the taste of Thai Milk Tea is strong in this moist cake. But it was a little too sweet for me.
Remove from freezer, place in glass bowl or cup and pour a shot of hot espresso coffee over each. Serve right away, stirring the vanilla ice cream into the hot coffee so that it melts a little.\"
Constantly having cake cravings these days, it\'s not funny.
Lusting after all sorts of comfort food and this is at the top of my list right now. I thought this loaf cake in particular could have done heavier injection of its titular fruit, but you know me, anything peanut butter, I love.
Dutch Colony Coffee Co shows off its creativity in its dishes for their rendition of their Affogato. Coming in three deconstructed elements, you would have to combine the shot of espresso and honey together with vanilla ice-cream with cookie crumbs and dates. While it\'s a satisfying sweet treat, it can get a bit overwhelmingly sweet with the dates and the dairy flavour in the ice-cream seemed a tad too strong
Eating and drinking coffee every other day. Spending another weekend in the East, but it\'s probably time to head back to the West that\'s where our hearts belong.
Ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich along with their Sweet Potato Truffle Fries, Assorted Bruschetta, Thai Milk Tea Loaf, and Cinnamon Roll. The fries could\'ve been more crispy and the roll could do with more cinnamon. Everything else was great! Will definitely be back for the Thai Milk Tea Loaf!
Chicken is nicely marinated with teriyaki but dislike when the bread is soaked up with the sauce.
Salmon bagel pretty decent with the serving size and generous salmon slices.
As for you, it\'s time to check out a new addition to Siglap, Dutch Colony Coffee Co. Love the space much better than the little kiosk at Pasarbella. Review on www.ms-skinnyfat.com link in bio!
There are many great cafes, but not all spaces are conducive for spending a couple of hours with your friends over simple food, great coffee and lovely ambience. At this humble spot, you\'re always ensured a consistently good cup, alongside great bites like their Thai Milk Tea Loaf or a Butter Croissant. For the more serious coffee drinkers, you even get to specify a brewing method of choice for their single origin beans. This spacious cafe is already a popular meeting spot for many Easties, and it certainly looks like there will be a steady growth of visits from Westies too! Another draw is also their free Wifi and ample seating, good omens for those who love working from cafes.
This one has a citrusy finish! They have quite a few blends to choose from :  ) Lovely place for a nice catch up with friends!
I was surprised by their Thai milk tea cake. üòã Surprisingly delicious .
It pays to wake up bright &amp; early on a Sunday morning. Popped by Dutch Colony Coffee at Frankel Avenue for a cuppa coffee. A good coffee always makes my day &amp; I\'m so glad that Dutch\'s coffee did! The roasted coffee beans translates into a cup of smooth and fragrant coffee which was easy on the throat. We got some cakes to go along - the earl grey citrus &amp; Thai milk tea loaf! I liked the flavors here, albeit they were a little too sweet for me! 
love the space, we sat here for 2 hours and it was quiet and coffee was great! i had a flat white and pictured is their thai milk tea cake
A festive blend that features notes of sweet peppercorn, raisins, figs, walnut and baker\'s chocolate. This resulted in an intense, complex tasting cappuccino that sat well with me. 
Although this handcrafted granola by The Edible Co. is suppose to be infused with coffee, I couldn\'t quite pick up the flavour. This doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t good though. The granola comes topped with yogurt (more please!), strawberries, bananas and blueberries, plus mini jugs of milk and honey. So whether you like it dry or mushy, extra sweetened or not, you can tweak to your heart\'s content. 
Aromatic and delicious, this croissant didn\'t have custard within its layers of buttery pastry but a kind of smooth almond paste instead. No better BFF for it than a good cup of coffee.\n
Loved the ambience of the cafe!! It has a rustic feel in the front porch, but yet it has seats as well which had natural lights at the back of the cafe. The main highlight was that they had Thai milk loaf, which really represented the Thai milk tea taste really well! The Earl Grey Citrus loaf was good as well, as the loaves were really soft and yet yummy. You may even select the origin and how you want your coffee to be made at the cafe! This will be a cafe i foresee myself visiting more often :)
Accidental first visit to Dutch Colony as I happened to be along Frankel Ave after badminton game. Amazed by the professional distinction of coffee beans by countries and various brewing method. Inspired to get to know my coffee better!
$5! Moist and yummy but espresso butter was a little too mild and too sweet!!!
Morning coffee under the sun, I could really love this place. Pretty decent chai latte. Dutch colony does their coffee well!
and the very dressed up dutch colony outfit at frankel now boast a nice food menu. very satisfying steak sandwich to go along with my amazeballs flat white.
and a damn good flat white for that matter. a good golden-brown crema is always a surest sign for starters. then savor and register all the sweet, bitter and acidity that hit the right notes. frankly (speaking), frankel is far but o so worth the drive down.
Have an inkling that these are supplied from Kreme Couture although I can\'t be sure (they sure look similar!). Thought the Earl Grey flavour was strong, and went well with the zingy glaze, but the cake was just a teeny bit too moist for me.
Back for their Steampunk-mod brewed coffee after trying the rendition at The New Black. While I could taste the fruitiness and sweetness of the beans, it seemed a tad weak in its body when compared to the one I had at The New Black. Still it\'s pretty good if you are one who had not tried brewed coffee from Steampunk-mod.
Dutch Colony Cafe. The pastries are awesome pawsome! Oh, and you should try the matcha cakes! It\'s heavenly! With cozy atmosphere, and vintage entrance it\'s a good place to relax and snapshot your selfies! 
Nov is a busy month but there\'s a few event I am looking forward to. üòä Have a good Tues.
If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.\" 1 John 2:15-17 quoted in Fury, gave me teary eyes
The steak is not as flavorful as what I would have liked and is rather overcooked. Perhaps cause the kitchen is too busy in churning out the orders if the crowd. \n<br />#burpple #dutchcolony #cafesg #eastsidecafesg #steaksandwich
Larger pieces of French toasts with banana slices and strawberries! Would like the toasts to have a stronger eggy taste and the butter to be stronger. \n<br />#burpple #dutchcolony #frenchtoast #cafesg #eastsidecafesg
Eggy Brioche toast with ham, cheese and bechamel sauce. Very well balanced taste with creamy cheese within the toast. It has a generous serving and the toast is not too dry.
Doesn\'t beat their earl gray and Thai milk tea loafs, the best! Had their chocolate truffle cake yesterday with my niece, chocolate cakes are not my thing but it is so delicious I took away a slice for the monsters today.
Early Tea break. Quiet caf√©. Good thai milk tea loaf &amp; coffee. Good read of a bad day. Day isn\'t that bad. But it\'s still Monday.
Found out they get their cakes and loaf cafes from Kreme Couture!! My current favorite muse for cakes!!! Moist and soft, every bite is dessert heaven 
Been missing out on all the new cafes lately. Finally had the time to try out Dutch colony coffee at frankel. I had their steam punk Columbia beans coffee, less acidic with a punch of sweetness. Coffee aroma perks me up :)
Brunch, my favorite meal of the day! Served with yogurt, fruits and granola from the edible co. It had this nutty crunch which I liked. I can have this all day everyday! 
Chocolate Ombre Cheesecake: Original Cheesecake, Milk chocolate and Dark chocolate. I like the combination and how it is not overly sweet. However, I will prefer if there is different texture in one cake, but that is a personal preference. Coffee, as usual, can be trusted over here. Great ambience too. Overall, a great place to hang out! 
Salmon Avo is a sandwich consisting Smoked Salmon slices, sourdough bread, avocado, tomato and a side salad. While the smoked salmon and avocado gave it a fresh and healthy feel, the lightly-toasted sourdough could be toasted a bit more as it felt no different if it were not toasted. The portions are somewhat huge for one. I would still take the Portobello Road if I visit again though; not only it is more photogenic, it seemed to have the oomph factor that the Salmon Avo lacks.
Sitting under the glass roof on a hot sunny day makes this an especially appealing cuppa to have. It\'s light body was acidic, but it has a sweet touch towards the end that\'s pretty close to caramel.
I\'ve long heard about Dutch Colony Coffee at Pasarbella but never tried it as it was quite out of the way. Now that they have opened close to my new place in the East in a nice chic shophouse, I can\'t find any excuse not to. The cappuccino here isn\'t as strong and aromatic as my favourite Papa Palheta\'s, but still strikes a good enough balance for my palette. And at $4.50 a cup is  excellent value. I also ordered a Portobello Road sourdough sandwich ($9) that had pretty fresh ingredients and was of a decent serving size. With such good value in their offerings, this cafe is likely to become a very popular one in this quiet part of the East. 
Banana bread was moist but I felt that there was no need for the toast marks in the bread beside it is after all actually a cake. Espresso butter for me was a little redundant and when I tried it with the banana bread, the butter didn\'t seem to blend very well with it. I\'ll probably skip the espresso butter the next time I\'m here
Had always wanted to try the coffee from this joint and when I heard that they opened a joint in the east, it\'s so obvious I had to make a trip down. Further more, it\'s only about 10 minutes away from home! Relatively big place with a nice modern workshop feel. A pity that they did not have much seating area. I wonder what happens when it is full house. But I will be back at this time soon! Now if only they offer free wifi 
Great ambience, consistent coffee since Pasar Bella, great place for a cuppa and open till 8pm and 10pm weekend 
With their flagship stall located in the depths of Pasarbella at Turf City, Dutch Colony has kindly opened up in the East for all east-siders to enjoy. Besides serving consistent, great coffee, this Frankel Ave branch also has an exciting menu of Coffee Lab workshops. These include classes focused on barista appreciation, latte art, coffee degustation and food pairings. You\'ll want to head down to this absolutely stunning spot for a cuppa and some breakfst, east-siders rejoice!
Dutch Blend. Nutty and sweet chocolatey tones in a smooth and creamy cuppa.
Seems like plans are getting big for Dutch Colony Coffee; after moving their roastery to an industrial district, now they have opened their second outlet at Frankel Ave. Unlike their first outlet, their second outlet boasts a spacious interior design that seems pretty much influenced from photos of overseas cafes seen on Instagram. The chandelier above the communal table, \"al fresco\" with glass roof and aircon to shelter patrons from the gruesome weather of Singapore and long counters is easily Instagrammable material even without much care to angle or lighting. Food menu is different as well; a variety of sandwiches and plated desserts are also available apart from the cakes on display. Don\'t forget to try their coffee as well; this is the reason why people would actually make their way for. A cafe inspired from Instagram made to be Instagrammed, this is sure spot for pro photographers or iPhotography alike, with some good food to share!
Open-faced sandwich that contains Portobello Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Rocket in Bold Balsamic Dressing and Sourdough Toast. Yet another sandwich I would dream to have for breakfast, for the toasted Sourdough was light, crisp and fresh; so fresh it really felt like it was freshly baked with its scent. Two Portobello Mushroom patties make the middle; huge, soft, earthy and juicy together with the tomatoes which were zesty and refreshing as it\'s juices burst with every cut with the knife. The Balsamic is as said; bold, as it flavours up the rockets with its aroma. If this isn\'t food porn, I don\'t know what else is.
This ain\'t the Banana Bread I was craving for as it\'s not as mushy with bananas as I was expecting, but it was still pretty yummy for being how soft and sweetly fragrant it was and had little bits of bananas for a bite. The best part was the outer crust which was extremely crusty when heated; probably the best I had so far. Only qualm was the Espresso butter, which didn\'t seem to taste like anything.

The crunchy carrot shavings made the cake even more delectable and I could have easily taken another slice without finding it too rich and filling.

Overall the bread was quite dry, but the beetroot hummus was nice and sweet not too overwhelming. I would not Croque Monsieur at all as there was too much butter! However I highly recommend the coffee here as it is fragrant and not too strong. Verdict: Would come back for the coffee only.

One place that I don\'t mind going back is Dutch Colony, which is conveniently located near to home and accessible via a bus from the interchange.\n<br />.\n<br />Renowned for their coffee, the cafe also serves a limited menu of food items that include the Croque Monsieur ($10) and Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich ($14). The food is not as stellar as their beverages but it will suffice for now. In addition, the natural lighting seeping through the glass ceilings makes it an Instagram-worthy place while the ambience brings out a warmth vibe.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 113 Frankel Avenue, Singapore 458230\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #burpple #burppletastemaker #foodporn #foodphoto #makan #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
For F1 enthusiasts, they might be eagerly anticipating the race between Mercedes, Williams and Ferrari but mine is to catch Maroon 5 sing LIVE! Let\'s hope for good weather and the best spot to catch all the action on Saturday.

This was served with lusciously pink smoked salmon on a thick layer of cream cheese. Though I think the bagel could be toasted just a lil more. Simple fares are notoriously difficult to perfect, preferences differ too. \n<br />Monster loves his salmon pink shirt\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #dutchcolonycoffee #dutchcolony #Burpple
A thin layer of brown sugar on top. \n<br />Perfect to go with a cup of espresso‚òïÔ∏è\n<br />#sgcafe#sgfoodie#sgcafehopping#eatoutsg#sgfoodtrend#sgfoodstagram#instafood_sg#foodpornsg#cafehoppingsg#foodlover#foodgasm#burpple#hungrygowhere#pickatsg#openricesg#cheesecake#cheesecakesg#dutchcolonycoffeeco#wewantsugar#dessertlover #dessertgram #kelly0204#eatoutsg #eatbooksg

I will be having a 2 weeks \"break\" away from work as I don the green uniform for a yearly affair. Before that, let\'s look forward to the weekends and have a slice of the Thai Milk Tea Cake ($5) from Dutch Colony Coffee Co. which complements a cup of Flat White ($5) perfectly. However, it would be better if there\'s more of that heavenly Thai Milk Tea sauce on my cake because the cake gets a bit too dry once the sauce runs out. Nonetheless, Dutch Colony Coffee Co. is a very relaxed, chill-out place to have a seriously good cup of coffee and cakes.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

I LOVE YOU COFFEE!
Cheese steak sandwich with sweet potato fries 
Loved how the combination allows you to appreciate different aspects of the Yirgacheffee. Pair it with a slice of Thai Milk Tea Loaf for the complete experience

Really don\'t like starting a new week with a foreboding feeling. Call it a premonition, but I have this odd feeling that I should brace myself for rough days ahead. *frantically looks around for ice cream*
Yesterday\'s teatime crime scene. Our crime: overeating.

This is what weekend brunches should be made of! 
Accompaniments to get through a working Sunday. #burpple
The taste of the coffee part is quite ok but would love to have a stronger chocolate taste to it. But still is quite ok. \n<br />#burpple #dutchcolony #cafesg #eastsidecafesg #coffeeroaster #mocha #mochaart
Located at Siglap area with Coast &amp; Company, Flor P√¢tisserie &amp; Craftsmen not far away, their setup here is much better than that at Pasarbella! \n<br />#burpple #dutchcolony #cafesg #eastsidecafesg #coffeeroaster

My fav.

I feel so bad because i love Dutch Colony at Pasarbella and i make it a point to get my cup of joe from them whenever i\'m there, but the coffee at their second outlet, as much as i love the location, is awful. My latt√© came with absolutely no foam nor did it taste of espresso and my sister\'s capp had a bitingly sour and cardboard-y taste. I hope they sort out (what i hope are) their teething issues soon.
Well pressed espresso with the right amount of milk. Chocolatey and slightly nutty after taste. Definitely going to be on my list of favourite lattes
