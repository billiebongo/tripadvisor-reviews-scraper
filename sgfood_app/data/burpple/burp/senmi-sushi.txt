Salmon is fresh and cut into thick slices. Price is really affordable. 
Best value for money at $36 for a plate for 2-3pax

.\n<br /> So fresh and yummy! 🍣🍣🍣 #throwback #tbt\n<br />Have a delicious dinner everyone! 🤗
.\n<br /> My mouth goes boom! 💣💣💣\n<br />Shrimp and avocado roll with wagyu beef slices, topped with fried crunchy tempura batter. Such a lethal combo bursting with flavors! 🍤🐄 #SenmiSushi #EmporiumShokuhin
Fresh as heck. Bowl is also the double the size of my head. $34, good for 2 hungry individuals (or 1) also, no queue! Food served within 5 minutes of ordering. #sold
If you are , you can come here and try their gigantic chirashi don! Do not attempt to try it alone! It\'s freaky huge, even bigger than my face
While many complain about the lack of creativity at Senmi Sushi, I personally think that it\'s the quality of ingredients that they put their emphasis on. Ingredients -- A5 wagyu beef, prawn, avocado, cucumber -- were undoubtedly fresh and they possess an attractive force that makes you crave for more. No overflowing mayonnaise or cheese, and for a rather friendly price tag, this maki is worth coming back for.
I don\'t take beef but my friend says it\'s not bad! 
One of the most instagrammed items from Emporium Shokuhin, the Giant Chirashi Don ($34). It\'s not that hard to understand why! Most tables had one on them. It\'s generously topped with ikura and fresh cubes of salmon, tamago, cucumber, tuna and etc., all on top of seaweed and a bed of sushi rice. Just look at that happy looking colorful bowl! Sashimi were lightly marinated and tasted nice, though we would have appreciated some freshly grated wasabi. The don feeds 2 pax very well! 
Premium Chirashi Don came with ama ebi, scallop and chutoro (but I found otoro too inside, that\'s a delightful surprise) as compared to the standard chirashi don there. When I first found this place on Burpple and some other food blogs, they sliced those sashimi instead of cubing them. I personally preferred them to be sliced but cubes apparently prevent the fish from absorbing too much of the sauce. While I think they can be more generous with the fish cubes for such a price tag, it was filling and sashimi were fresh. What impressed me the most was the rice, neither overly sticky nor overwhelmingly sweet. On a side note, skip their chawanmushi and fish bone miso soup (tagged at $2.20++ each) as the chawanmushi had uneven texture and was a plain jane while the latter was nothing extraordinary.
Topped with flame-seared wagyu beef which was very tender, cheese and crispy bits with Tempura prawn, avocado and cucumber. Think it\'s quite worth the $15. 
Salmon is fresh, topped with ebiko. Nothing new about this but for $14, the quality and portion is pretty good. 
$20.90++ Hamachi, salmon and hotate sashimi platter 
A4-grade Wagyu Beef; flame-seared atop the sushi rice wrapped with avocado and cucumber with mozzarella cheese sprinkled and Rice Krispies over the top. #emporiumshokuhin #senmisushi #marinasquare #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgfood #foodporn
Strange how I never really liked Sushi Rolls in the past (carbs!) but gotten to like how fun, varied and colourful it can be.
The rice was a little hard and cold, and I could be wrong but I think it wasn\'t the short-grain Japanese rice. We ordered some sashimi slices and they were waaaay too cold, tasted like they were right out of the fridge. I think this place has the potential to become better though. The service was really good, so overall it was still a pretty enjoyable meal.
They served from Japanese fine dinner to a humble bowl of Raman. .\n<br />|\n<br />This was what we tried ⬇️\n<br />(Dynamite Maki by Senmi Sushi)\n<br />Basic Maki wrapped with the premium A4 Waygu beef. Once the beef touched the tongue, it started to melt and fused with the sushi rice. To make it even better, cheese was added to stack the flavors and tempura crust to give the texture.  This must be the most worth eating dish in their Restuarant. .\n<br />|\n<br />I believe that the freshness of seafood will improved, once the flow of customers increased. However, the dishes really need to be more creativity. .\n<br />|\n<br />To see other dishes review, click on www.jiaknonstop.com
Highly recommended by the staff here is this Maki which they claimed that it uses A4-grade Wagyu Beef; flame-seared atop the sushi rice wrapped with avocado and cucumber with mozzarella cheese sprinkled and Rice Krispies over the top. It\'s nothing gastronomical, but the beef is indeed quality with a bit of smoky flavour and not carrying any gamey-ness, while the sushi rice could be more moist though carrying just the right amount of sweetness.
This was a bit of a let down though; the flame-seared fish seemed to be done at an inadequate temperature so the fish is cooked on one side, lacking the charred flavours but still rather fatty and chunky on the other; not as well-balanced for a melt-in-the-mouth texture which it lacked. If anything, the rice was worth a mention for how sweet it was, and the Ikura definitely would not fail with its popping umami flavours.
Don\'t really have much experience with Uni because the only one I ever had was from a Uni Croquette which wasn\'t very fresh, but this was a little more sweeter and firmer with a soy sauce-like flavour. My friend said he had better ones though ...
Unagi don, small portion but power packed

Fresh and generous  ingredients. Good service. Worth try. 
Amazing maki with cheese!
Chutoro, salmon, hotate, hamachi, all fresh. Only S$18++. I like it dry without sauces, hence this is more suitable for me, compared to Teppei\'s barachirashi.
if only there\'s a travelling machine to bring me to and fro any country I wanna go instantaneously! 🙄💭 @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @singaporeeats #japanese #chirashi #chirashidon #senmisushi #sashimi @emporiumshokuhin #latergram

🍙🍣Torched wagyu beef wrapped round sushi containing seaweed, avocado, egg n prawn. For added crunch, tempura bits strewn all over and heavy drizzling of teriyaki sauce. Beef so tender and sweet...no need for extra marinades or salt. It was so mouthwatering.
