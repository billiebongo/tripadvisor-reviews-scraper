With a crispy exterior and chewy interior, the mixed berry bun is a must try! The lemon drizzle makes a good tea time snack as well. The breads at Baker &amp; Cook is a must try!
Thin, buttery tart crust stuffed full with apples and raisins, sprinkled with cinnamon, and covered with more apples! I loved this because the level of sweetness was just right, and the taste of cinnamon was just right as well - not too strong, which allowed the fragrance of the apples to shine through. :)
I feel that the lemon curd is now less tangy compared to the first time I had it... Which saddens me cause I like my lemon tarts tart! :( I guess this suits the tastes of the general populace better though... :(
My first time checking out the outlet at Chip Bee Gardens! I like the layout here more cause it\'s brighter and more organized, and it boasts a larger seating capacity! :D Here\'s a salmon quiche with a feta and tomato salad. B&amp;C\'s quiches need no introduction. The buttery, flakey crust held a flavourful and smooth egg filling that is generously studded with capsicum and salmon.
The Lemon Tart, Carrot Cake, Almond Chocolate Croissant and the great company! ♡ #superlatergram
One of the best lemon tart I\'ve ever had. It\'s not too sour and the crust has a nice buttery taste to it. 
Latte // Flat White // Fruit Tart // Lemon Drizzle Cake + a good companion.
Sometimes it\'s good to keep yourself away from the busy crowd. Just yourself and a cuppa of coffee. Baker &amp; Cook serves good coffee hence pretty fancy latte art as well. 
We decided to go cafe hopping. Found some hidden gems. With @leenzsim #burpple
Ok, before you judge the deformed poached egg, the focus is on the lovely red spread on the toast! Baker &amp; Cook sells some spreads, and I really like the smoked pepper one. It\'s smoky, savoury and tangy. I like eating it on toast with an egg with an oozy yolk 😋 There are samples provided at the counter for you to try.
Strawberry jam on nutty toast is the look of bak kwa from afar. 😋
Very eggy! Just wish for the crust to be deeper so it can be filled with more eggs!
Had a few cakes and coffees here. The coffee menu here is quite misleading as they were showing the price of a small cup instead of regular, so when they asked if I want a regular or large, i opt for a regular one, and expecting the price as shown on the menu, but at the end I was told the one showing on the menu is small one instead (without indicate on the menu at all, like latte was showing as $5 on menu and eventually i paid $6 for regular). The cakes i had (red velvet ($6.5) and lemon drizzle($5.8)) are too sweet as well.

Spanish Omelette (S$16)\n<br />Chirizo sausage, red &amp; green capsicums, onion, cheese and a wee kick of chilli, served with B &amp; C toast \n<br />Available at @BakerAndCookSG \n<br />Served with BBQ sauce. I wasn\'t a fan of multi grain bread, but the crispy nutty toast was very nice with the apricot jam available on the table. The Omelette was packed with lots of liao while cheesy inside. Quite filling too.\n<br />|\n<br />Baker and Cook\n<br />Address 🏠 : 44 Jalan Merah Saga, # 01-56 Chip Bee Gardens, Singapore 🇸🇬 278 116\n<br />Tel ☎ : 6472 0998\n<br />Open 💈 : \n<br />Sun - Thu : 7.30am - 8pm\n<br />Fri - Sat : 7.30am - 10pm\n<br />Brunch at Weekends &amp; PH : 7.30am - 7.30pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Holland Village (CC21)

Beautiful setting and amazing food (snacks). Actually visited this place while waiting for a seat in another. Just by looking at the food around me, I can see that the food is amazing. My friend and I just ate at another place so we bough the dips platter and I got a flat white. The coffee is good but not amazing but I loved the dips platter. 9/10 (would come back here again)

Ordered the Canele, Pain Au Croissant, Raspberry Cupcake and Lemon Tart! Lemon tart was good, but not the best I\'ve tried. Canele was also well-executed, but I would love to have a stronger vanilla flavour punch and a crispier exterior. 
MMMM.
Always good!
Then, my days would be a little brighter.
Friendly staff. Perfect for a chill day. 
Sweet and healthy 
These were alright. Nothing special. Id like to try the Carrot Cake and Lemon Tart next time.
64cm cube of goodness! This australian dessert, chocolate Lamington is soft and moist, and the coconut flakes add to the flavour ad texture as well. Will want to try the lemon flavoured one next time! It\'s a good place to relax or work on your laptop during weekends
#snowglowswhiteonthemountainstonight So soft and fluffy #likeapuppy that it disintegrates easily in my fork. They serve Nutella paninis too, but with the description \"especially for the kids\", order and risk being judged. Who cares though, it\'s Nutella. #cafehoppingsg #sgcafes #instafood #foodstagram #bakerandcook #odesigns #burpple
Omg.
😱

Afternoons like these don\'t come by often, and I really treasure the quality time spent together ❤️ #burpple
😍😍 Yummy in my tummy ^^ #burpple
One of my favourite hangouts for coffee and pastries! 
My fave comfort food even if it means chewing till my mouth is aching 😂😂
The latte was slightly stronger than the usuals, with an additional shor. The cosy interior of the place made a good place to chill out too!
😌 I have forgotten how crowded Singapore is on a weekend haha #brunch #baker&amp;cook #chillax #weekend
We got Eggs Benedict ($17) and French Toast. Both were delicious! For the Eggs Benedict, they added chilli oil, a good attempt at fusion dishes. However, it is quite spicy and might taste a little different for the normal, and the eggs were not runny (maybe they weren\'t meant to, hehe). Not for the faint-hearted. The French Toast was fluffy and delicious and you can ask for more syrup FOC. I had babyccino, basically warm milk, it was quite nice. Latte was good. The prices are a little on the high side, but they have cheaper and delicious sandwiches etc. The ambience was good, it was a good experience :)
Will make another return trip one day!
💪 #bakerandcook
Egg benedict with smoked salmon.
I love ordering babyccinos at cafes, even though it\'s just milk and velvety milk foam :b Not much of a caffeine addict, am I?
Everytime here, everytime satisfied. Had vege #quiche , mixed berry #danish , #toastoftheday with luscious #strawberryjam and #flatwhite to start a #beautifulweekend ! ☀️
Woots! This one is heaps more convenient to get to compared to their flagship cafe in Hillcrest, with more seating space too!✌️
.\n<br /> .
Had a quiche and it was nothing out of this world. Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff? #ichee #burpple #verylategram
