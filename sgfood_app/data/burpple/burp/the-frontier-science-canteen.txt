Always wanted to try this! It\'s not bad, they used sweet mango but not a lot. Perhaps once is enough :)
Asked for the \'mix mix\' option. The ingredients from Lor Mee, Fishball Mee, Wan Tan Mee with my Kway Teow. With an added \'lor kway seet\' too.
Fell in love with ayam penyet in my last year in NUS. This one at science canteen is super super good! The chilli is real shiok too!
I\'m in school today so it\'s canteen food! I have Yong tau foo, or rather I always have YTF. Love it so much!😁 Now Im passing the challenge on to the 1st lucky soul @bleuginger, with the tag #kiyomi Mummy I know this is pretty easy for you? Hehe! I just can\'t get enough of her pretty face!❤😘 so the rule is to take 5 shots of Kiyomi and post in 5days and to tag a different person with every post!😉 Have fun mummy!❤
Pork Ribs Noodles (S$2.30)\n<br />Topup S$1 for dumplings 🥟 \n<br />Throwback to last meal at the temporary canteen in @nus_singapore before the new canteen was opened mid of this month.\n<br />From Chinese Noodles, the stall with longest queue that day. Actually there’s 2 queues for this stall with the shorter one for Ban Mian.\n<br />Looked nothing much but it’s quite tasty 😋. Lots of soft bones.
Eggs and Ribeye.
5 stalls have moved over with 400 seating capacity.
Fried Chicken Wings set for $3, super affordable, got a cup of soursop yakult ($1.60) to chill off the heat from the sun and the chili 😅. Curry gravy was yummy and so were the wings, chili was tad spicy lol. Wonderful chat time with Yaz! \n<br />#lunch #lunchtime #burpple #whati8today #8dayseat #ayampenyet #nussciencecanteen #chickenwing #muslimfood #malayfood
School canteen Lor! \n<br />The chicken was fried till every bite you take there is a crunchy sound to it! But the meat was slightly dry, XBC said today was not the best. The chill was shiok too but I still prefer the one at lucky plaza. If the auntie, have drizzle more curry on the rice, it would be awesome! #sgfoodies #sgfood #burpple #burpplesg #whatieat

It is a Indonesian cuisine consisting of fried chicken that is smashed with the pestle against the motar to make it softer and served with cucumbers, fried tofu and sambal! |\n<br />This is especially good at NUS science faculty canteen. The chicken is so tender yet crispy on the outside and only $4.30. You have the option of choosing brown rice too for additional $0.10. 😋🍗\n<br />|\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #jiaklocal #eatoutsg #burpple #sambal #chicken #friedchicken #ayampenyet #foodporn #foodgasm #vsocam #vscofood #eathealthy #travel #explore #travelgram #bbctravel #photooftheday #photography

It still sells the same thing! I also ordered almost the same thing. 😂😂😂
I added extra chicken wing.
Free wifi if you\'re a student of NUS because this is located on campus! Most affordable salad bowl, $5.50 for a small bowl with 2 meats of your choice, super generous servings as well!
Warning:The chilli is very spicy!!! #foodporn #ayampenyat #dinner #chicken
