Essentially firm, full-bodied locks of linguini dressed in a wickedly spicy, gooily eggy and voluminously thick chilli crab sauce. Elsewhere, only some crabs turned up, but you know how these elite toolbox school kids are. 3.8/5
Raw Hokkaido scallops, truffle oil, preserved radish \"chye poh\", shio kombu. Who would\'ve thought the common hawker street food \"chye poh\" would work so well with raw scallops? It\'s a soft Asian touch that works beautifully alongside shio kombu.
The entire menu is dotted with local influences, and surprisingly well. Here, Chef Willin Low recreates duck salad with vermicelli and curry ice cream. Trust us, it tastes better than it sounds. 
Very refreshing and I reckon a Thai influence or inspired salad. 
Not ur usual yusheng. With 2 types of fishes, vermicelli, lettuce, fragrant onion oil and other ingredients which I can\'t tell. V delicious! 
Giving Wild Rocket\'s Char Siew a go and of course its amazing! So soft and so balanced. Loved the rice paper veil - made it all the more tantalising. Chef Willin is a national treasure! #foodiconsofsg #heritagesg
One of my favourite desserts - layers of rich cream cheese stacked atop macerated berries with caramelised biscuits hidden in between the layers. Could have this every day.
a heavenly creation by chef willin.  just like how I fell it love with his deconstructed strawberry cheesecake those years ago. I am being bought over once again.
Chef Willin Low\'s lengthy break has ended and Wild Rocket is finally open. We tried the 4-course menu for dinner and were glad to see it had two to three options for each course. The following is one of the sets we shared, plus my views on them. Clockwise from top left...\n<br />Course 1: The \"blue swimmer crab congee soup with egg emulsion\" was a light and clear soup with a sticky rice ball. Decent but nothing to shout about.\n<br />Course 2: The \"salmon red rice &amp; baby octopus donburi\" turned out to be quite unexciting as well, although I did like the chewiness of the sweetish red rice. \n<br />Course 3: Initially, I was a bit skeptical of this but the \"red snapper Khmer amok with kaffir lime\" proved to be lovely. Slightly spicier than the amok curries I have had in Cambodia, the amok element here was a concentrated reduction, making it a perfect complement for the fresh fish.\n<br />Course 4: Chef Willin\'s flair for blending East and West was exemplified in this \"pandan infused panna cotta with salted gula melaka\" dessert. Lusciously soft and aromatic, this was without a doubt, the best course in this set.
After a hiatus of eight months, Wild Rocket is back in business again. The best way to get to know Chef Willlin Low\'s fusion-style cuisine is to order the set menu, as it allows you to mix and match different options. Here\'s another combination we tried, starting from top left, clockwise...\n<br />Course 1: Off to an exquisite start with ultra-thin, almost transparent, very fresh fish slices of the \"barrumundi carpaccio with orange shallot oil\". \n<br />Course 2: My favourite dish of the night was this \"crabmeat linguine in spicy tomato cream sauce\" as I found it to be very spicy and fragrant. Definitely returning soon to indulge in an a la carte order of this pasta.\n<br />Course 3: My tastebuds declared the \"beef short rib with smoked oyster milk and potato mash\" another winner. Loved the wonderful tender meat and gorgeous umami sauce. The portion was just right too.\n<br />Course 4: The \"dark chocolate lava gateau\" closed the dinner on a sweet enough note but it didn\'t exactly bowl me over.
I especially love the salmon w brown rice and the crab linguini. Desserts are good too!
I\'m not a panna cotta person or a salted caramel fan but this one had me converted! It\'s really THAT good... #nofilter
The translucent paper is actually very thin rice noodle... \"Fwah\", was our reaction... #nofilter
Modern Singapore as the Chef calls it. Hokkien Cannelloni. Tau Yew Bak long chui chui then hor wrapped in pasta then hor baked with cheese lah. #latergram
Roast Chilean Bass with Liquid Nasi Lemak and Dry Sambal. How interesting eh?
Modern Singapore Mee Siam. An atas-ified version of it. Good idea!
Pomelo Salad with Frozen Coconut Dressing. It\'s a very delicious and interesting starter.
So love this seabass! The sauce below is liquid nasi lemak. So yummy, so good!!
Tau Yu Bak with Pasta? I can hear fundamentalists crying foul because rice for them is the only way to savour this porky dish. But a bite into this Chinese soy braised pork ragout in cannelloni with its creamy sauce and you begin to wonder, why not? The Chinese did after all invented the Pasta, no? |  #yummy #food #pasta #wildrocketsg #instaweekend #weekendbrunch
Will the real chicken rice please stand up. After whetting our appetite with the flavours of chicken rice earlier, chef @willcookwilleat\'s team did send out the chicken and rice to the table by the second course. | #food #chickenrice #instaweekend #sundaybrunch #wildrocketsg
Beef me up, chef - part2: Beef Carpaccio with a twist. Clearly covered the shrub of coriander is a garlic-ginger paste (roots hidden under the \"ground\", geddit?) which would note taste out of place in a chicken rice dish. Sure makes you think of it when you taste the beef. Again, no chicken nor rice were harm in the making of this dish. A mind boggling dish | #food #beef #wildrocketsg #sundaybrunch #instaweekend
Beef me up Chef! Day out with @u_n_c_nothingyet started deliciously with a Beef Carpaccio, which came with a surprising twist... Can you guess what it is? | #food #beef #wildrocketsg #sundaybrunch #instaweekend
From earlier today: Once again, I can\'t think of another better dish to end the splendid meal. Another day, another Chendol comes to our table. Here, chef @willcookwilleat\'s version is put together with pandan panna cotta, Gula Melaka syrup, coconut ice cream and cookie crumbs. Now I\'m sure @wombatk and @boo_licious would like to have some too! Thank chef for putting together a  pleasurable afternoon for our table. Hope to return the favour when you\'re in KL next. | #food #dessert #sgig
From earlier today: This was easily the highlight of the afternoon. Roast red snapper with otak-otak sauce and baby Brussels sprouts. It\'s really as amazing as it sounds. Now I am inspired to attempt my own version of fuss-free deconstructed Peranakan flavours. Only problem is, one needs to learn how to construct its complex flavors first before taking it apart. So much for fuss-free. Guess I\'ll just reside to the fact I\'ll be returning for another round of this dish. | #food #sgig
From earlier today: The Panda\'s \"carb-free\" option as opposed to our pasta (he obviously doesn\'t know what he\'s missing out on), Chiangmai Sausage on a bed of tarty salsa. | #food #sgig
From earlier today: When the menu said Mee Siam Speghettini, I was expecting the regular Singaporean version that comes with a side of Tau Chu gravy on the side. Wasn\'t very excited about it to be honest. But then, when the dish arrived, my nose instantly perked up by the wonderfully fragrant Indonesian black shrimps. The taste reminds us of the Mee Siam we Malaysians are more used to - tangy and full of savory spicy umami. Guess one shouldn\'t be too quick to judge | #food #sgig
From earlier today: Absolutely love the cleverness of this appetizer. The typical Thai-inspired pomelo salad has been reinvented with Tiger Prawns and a Frozen Coconut dressing which had some heat (from chili) at the same. The textures were playful and whimsical. All in all it was larvelee! | #food #sgig
From earlier today: Our first taste of Chef @willcookwilleat\'s cooking came in the form of a Barramundi Ceviche. He said it was his interpretation of Yue Sang, but we say its clean, delicate and fresh flavours reminds us of  steamed fish or sang yue porridge made by ol skool Chinese food vendors. | #food #sgig
We are here. We wait with bated breath. | #lunch #food #instaweekend
Finally checking out the bastion of atas Singaporean hawker food (aka Mod Sin), Wild Rocket. Red snapper with otah sauce, soft shell chili crab with squid ink mantou, and deconstructed egg tart with salted egg ice cream may sound gimmicky but they really do work! Each dish was wonderfully balanced and had a depth of flavor that was pleasantly surprising. Standout dishes include said snapper and egg tart, and the nori tsukadani spaghettini. Mad props Wilin Low! 4.5 nombles.
Looks terrible (due to insufficient lightings) but tastes heavenly... 
Did not live up to expectations, maybe because I was expecting a \"ngao lam\"(牛腩) that is stewed till tender and juicy... The star anise was over powering. Pasta is wholesome and carbo-satisfying...

Affordable lunch set.surprised by the dessert.best ever
Lov the texture of pasta and curry is sooo good
The flavor combination is just plain amazing! The combo elevated the sweetness yet gave the fruit delicate touches of an umami-like rounded flavor, like magic!! This sorbet is a parallel example of that flavor combination creation which gave me a ratatouille moment. \n<br />Wild Rocket, Singapore\n<br />Asia\'s 38th Best Restaurant 2016)
One of my ultimate favorite desserts of all time.  Different from all the strawberry cheesecakes I\'ve had before.  Deconstructed yet it delivers on the taste. I love the way the strawberries are prepared...almost like a compote but delicate.  I could eat this Everyday! But don\'t tell my doctor.
Simple yet tasty and would definitely make the taste buds happy.  Request for a bit more extra truffle sauce. \n<br />Wild Rocket, Singapore\n<br />Asia\'s 38th Best Restaurant 2016)
Topped with Japanese food staple in the form of the Onsen egg.  Wonderful work Chef Willin!! Wild Rocket, Singapore\n<br />Asia\'s 38th Best Restaurant 2016)
Seems simple to do...only if you\'re Chef Willin Low, who prepared this dish with so much passion and love, it exudes in the melange of flavors incorporated, where the rice is seasoned with a sweet soy teriyaki type of infusion then topped with soft and silky salmon belly.  I\'m sold at first bite!! Wild Rocket, Singapore\n<br />Asia\'s 38th Best Restaurant 2016)
Amazing 6 course meal

Interesting dish and flavours
And the icing on the cake goes to this egg-celebration creation - Egg tart in a glass with salted egg ice cream. My mouth is still salivating thinking of this. The contrast of sweet and salty, custard and grainy preserved egg was sensational to the palate and heightened by the buttery sweet crust pastry that separated the cold cream from the custard. Love!
