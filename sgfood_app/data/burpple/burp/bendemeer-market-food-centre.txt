Freshly made upon order, the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun is slightly different from the usual, with not just shrimp wrapped within but also cabbage which gave it a tinge of sweetness. HK soy sauce was on the weak side, and the Chee Cheong Fun was somehow on the thick side though.
So hard to find this nowadays. It\'s so simple, just ice, coconut milk, honeydew, watermelon &amp; sago. Bliss in my tummy.
üç§üçú Have to avoid eating rice for lunch today because i don\'t wanna get lunch coma during the 2nd half of the course.
Interesting mixed of the two, sauce is flavourful with chili which the ytf is crispy.
actually it tasted like the usual lor mee, but kudos to the fried fish fillet! $2.50 for this huge bowl, look at the size of the spoon. #lunch #lormee #muarlormee #chinese #chinesefood #noodles
I did not remember e fishball noodle stall name but this fishball noodle and their meatball is fantastic! Price from $2.50!

Soft but crispy on the edges, filled generously with crunchy crushed peanut and sugar, yummm üòç Oh! You can also have a \"puff\" variant that they fold the pancake in halves then seal the edges.
Apparently I was wrong, it\'s huge üòÇ It\'s a nice rice roll but I don\'t like the sauce that much... I prefer soy sauce rather than this thicker peanut sauce(?) I don\'t know why everytime I visit a hawker centre, the stall I want to go always suddenly close üòÇ Next time better check google for opening hours first üò• \n<br />Nan Rong Chee Cheong Fun\n<br />#01-11 Bendemeer Market and Food Centre, Blk 29 Bendemeer Road 330029\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cheecheongfun #riceroll #dimsum #chinesefood #hawkersg #hawkerfood #hawkerfoodsg #localfoodsg #foodsg #foodiesg #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpplesg #burpple #eatmore #eatmoresg #foreverhungry
The bowl of laksa ($5) comes with egg, tau pok, fish cake. Taupok was very enjoyable to bite into, as the gravy oozes into your palette. Unlike the rich and coconutty variant, this laksa brings back nostalgic warm memories of the laksa we had as kids. It\'s creamy, fragrant, and savoury but not overly rich. Definitely won\'t leave you too guilty if you\'re watching your calories.\n<br />_______________\n<br />Min Ji Laksa\n<br />29 Bendemeer Road\n<br />Bendemeer Market &amp; Food Centre\n<br />#01-31\n<br />Singapore 330029\n<br />.\n<br />#eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #exploreflavours #dojoeats
Got up early for a platter of pan fried kuehs and carrot cake. This stall fries up Png Kueh, Soon Kueh and Ku Chye Kueh in carrot cake styles. Especially like the layer of crisp bits with egg and chai poh coating to contrast with the softer parts of the kueh. No bad comments for the carrot cake either. The best of both worlds if you love kuehs and carrot cake - definitely one of those traditional homey brekkie you wouldn\'t want to miss :)\n<br />_______________\n<br />Yong Xiang Carrot Cake\n<br />29 Bendemeer Road\n<br />Bendemeer Market &amp; Food Centre\n<br />#01-35\n<br />Singapore 330029\n<br />opens 6am to 2pm (closed on Mon, Wed and Fri)\n<br />.\n<br /> #eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #exploreflavours #dojoeats #kueh

The bowl of noodle comes with minced meat, fried wanton, char siew and some vegetables. If not for the fragrant shallot oil, it would be just an ordinary bowl of noodle.

But have you tried fried soon kueh and png kueh in carrot cake style? Very unique and tasty. Full of wok hei. #burpple #burrplesg #uncagestreetfood #bendemeermarket #breakfast #wokhei #sglocalfood #sgmakandiary #foodsg #hawkersg #foodforfoodies #sgfoodies #sgfoodlover
The good thing is that it is not those overly sweet type but just enough to give it a subtle sweet finishing. What stood out for the wanton mee at One Ton Noodle is the chilli sauce that delivers a spicy shiokness while not numbing the senses.
While I was in the queue, I noticed all the patrons in front of me ordered the White Carrot Cake ($3), so I changed my mind and followed the crowd. The stall does quite a good plate of fried carrot cake with a generous amount of egg fried to aromatic crispiness.
It was only heard said until I see it for myself while in the queue. Not only Png Kueh, the stall also sells Soon Kueh and Ku Chai Kueh. Once you tell the stall uncle what you want, the auntie behind the frying with pan fried the kuehs to an exterior crispiness before adding eggs onto the chopped kuehs. This is my first time having Fried Png Kueh and Soon Kueh ($3.50) in fried carrot cake style and I really like the extra layer of crispiness with a coating of fragrant egg on top of the kueh.
If you can take spicy, the chilli sauce is damn shiok. Noodle is thicker and has more bite compare to those Hong Kong type. Char Siew is above average which slightly lacking the charred. Overall a shiok plate of wanton mee. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #hawkerfood #hawker #wantonmee

It had a slight wok hei taste to it and the portion was also great for its pricing.
The noodles are flavourful and the soup is also mixed with beansprouts to tone down the taste of the prawn stock!
Each have the special taste, but I prefer the black

Hope it\'s as good as it seems.
Opening a #bakery selling reasonably priced fluffy buns in a neighborhood is a seriously good idea haha. Ever since they opened a branch here, there has always been a never ending queue. I can get my barcook \"cranberry cheese\" and Liu sa bun fix conveniently. Hahs #bread #breakfast #singapore #food #buns #sgfood #igsg #yummy

One of Singapore\'s iconic dishes, the Laksa served over here at Min Ji is a favorite among many who patronise the Bendemeer Market. The soup is spicy enough and the coconut milk doesn\'t overpower the flavour of the broth. I would, however, have preferred my soup a little thicker. The \"Taupok\" (Fried Layered Beancurd) soaks up the delicious soup and bursts in your mouth when you bite into it. Absolutely delightful!
