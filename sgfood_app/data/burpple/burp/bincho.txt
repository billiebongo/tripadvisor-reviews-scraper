Starting from $25++, choose from a wide selection of donburi bowls including Yakitori, Beef Tongue, Uni, Wagyu Beef and Tsukune, amongst others. Each comes with 3 sides that change on a semi regular basis, a cup of rich, aromatic chicken broth, and a choice from the desserts of the day.
The Kaisen Don is beautifully presented, featuring plump salmon, tuna, scallops and lustrous globes of ikura scattered like amber jewels atop the crown of seafood. The Sunday all day donburi set comes with 3 sides that change on a semi regular basis, a cup of rich, aromatic chicken broth, and a choice from the desserts of the day.
If Japanese fare is seafood and rice bowls to you but you don\'t want to have a Bara Chirashi like how everyone is having one, this could be quite your thing. Part of the set lunch menu that packs an appetizer, salad, Karage, soup &amp; pickles and dessert alongside this Don, this is pretty much value-for-money at $40++. The amount of uni was actually rather reasonable for the price; smooth, creamy and fresh alongside loads of Ikura that gives the umami burst factor every time you pop them into the mouth with a little morsel of rice, some vegetables and a tiny bit of wasabi. Something that is meant for the die-hard Uni fan.
A mee pok-serving kopitiam by day, this quaint space at the corner of Moh Guan Terrace transforms into Bincho, a sleek, modern interpretation of a yakitori-ya by night. Three different menus focused on yakitori (ranging from $120 to $150++) are offered, and change frequently. Bring a couple of adventurous eaters along, and don\'t let Chef Asai\'s use of unusual parts of chicken (think bishop\'s nose, heart, liver) put you off; they\'re his specialty for a reason. Of course, you can also opt for à la carte dishes such as the irresistible Mentai Stuffed Chicken Wings that star crisp skin and an umami bomb of mentaiko. If lamb is your game of choice, then the Lambburg, a lamb patty mixed with chicken cartilage slathered in pork neck oil before hitting the grill, is a must-order. With an extensive list of sake, shochu and whisky here, always say yes to pairing these drinks with your meal, or simply end off with some delicious Japanese-inspired cocktails!
The oyako don is very satisfying with the onions, eggs and chicken! Break the yolk and mix it well with the rice. The chicken pieces came with skin though, which some may not enjoy. 
Bincho\'s set lunch which comes with your choice of don and fried chicken skin salad, glazed chicken wings, chicken soup &amp; pickles and a yuzu sorbet/ black sesame pudding. I must say that it\'s quite value for money! The tsukune was tender with great seasoning on the outer layer that was nicely grilled. It comes with some grilled vegetables that were excellent too. I just wished that the tsukune patty was bigger!! 
Beautifully grilled and sliced to perfect bites. Truly an excellent dish to have with beer and friends. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 November 8
Not for the faint hearted but this is tasty and crunchy. Great beer snack. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 September 30. 
Part of the omakase course. Very tender and tasty. Great meat dish. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 September 30
Mixed the raw egg yolk with the marinated rice and eat with the patty and it\'s heavenly. Oishii! Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 September 9
Really tasty and good to go with beer too. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 16
This is just the start of the omakase course and it\'s good. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 16
Not something which you would normally want to order when you see it on the menu. But I\'m glad we did! It tasted like sauteed mushrooms. The food was not too bad and so were the cocktails (I had pineapple lemongrass). The Ayu fish wasnt for me. Too many fine bones and it was salty. I would say, pick the meats and probably go for the set dinners for better value. 
The grilled Wagyu Beef is paired with Nectar Pedro Ximenez, oozing with raisins and caramel with subtle hints of oak.
THE BOMB! this was so good! The charcoal burn on the chicken skin, and as u sink your teeth in, mentai burst in your mouth! 
New find yesterday evening. Really interesting yakitori tapas bar at tiong bahru area. Took us awhile before finding the entrance to this speakeasy bar. Mee pok stall by day and tapas bar by night. 
Not usually a fan of foie gras, but I have to take my hat off to the chef now. This was absolutely gorgeous. Minced meat with foie gras. Dish after dish, this true blue hidden gem continued to amaze me. Juicy and tender and the sauce was absolutely scrumptious but did not over power the dish. 
Some dishes are so amazing that they just have that melt in your mouth quality about them. This is one of those dishes. Ox tongue that is absolutely delicious and perfectly garnished. Not trying this dish is definitely not an option. 
Finally there\'s a way to solve the veggie eating issues for all parents. DIP IT IN CHEESE!! So sinful yet so awesome. 
Chicken gizzard with either green tea or curry powder dip. Crunchy, delicious and tasty. Everything you would want in a dish like this. Presentation wise, you just can\'t bear the touch it but your stomach will want otherwise. 
It may not seem like much. But this bowl is filled with smiles. Crispy chicken skin that is absolutely delicious. Not too oily that it\'ll make you sick and not too dry that\'ll make you think that it\'s no different to eating chicken. 
The grilled char on the veggies lends it a brilliant smoky flavour that goes fantastically with the creaminess of the egg yolk mixed in with rice and sauce. Not forgetting the totally tender minced chicken patty. The set today came with a fried chicken skin topped salad, chicken drumlets and a mochi dessert. Great value for lunch at $30.
It made me think that all octopus were created equal on this planet.
This is Grilled asparagus with fried leek and garlic miso. Will be sharing more about the special collaboration in the next few days.
A great ginger \"japeritif\" to whet one\'s appetite for a sumptuous meal ahead!
This dish kick started off the Bincho Set. It was so delicious, the chicken liver pate was smooth and creamy, when spread on the crunchy bread it was like heaven. On the plate there\'s salmon with sauce so tasty i drank it all up! Char siew and potato mash. The set meal albeit expensive, bt worth every bit!
Salmon, tuna belly and tuna sashimi.
Dessert is prepped by the kitchen of sibling establishment, Restaurant Andre - it\'s usually unflavoured cheesecake, but this one is infused with matcha. Crowning the top of the cake are milky blobs of amazake (fermented rice) - tastes like makgeolli (Korean rice wine)!
The rice bowl with chicken chunks and simmered eggs is tasty, though not mindblowing; what steals the limelight for me is that accompanying bowl of slightly cloudy, \"essence of chicken\" broth. Good stuff. 
Funky and not-so-funky bits, all grilled so tasty and tender that even I, who shun innards, found these quite palatable. The crispy skin on the thigh was the icing on the cake. 💋👌
One of the highlights at Bincho for me is the Tsukune (meatball), so flavourful and juicy on its own, but even better moistened with that raw egg yolk. 
Chef Asai\'s specialty is chicken - all parts. He does them well too, tender, succulent and not over-seasoned. Extra tasty with mushroom salt, yuzukosho, and nama wasabi to dip the meat in. 
The offerings change every day depending on what\'s available, but one thing that you\'ll likely get is the creamy brick of chicken liver pâté studded with black peppercorns for a burst of heat. 
This humble little coffeeshop in Tiong Bahru has only ever sold mee pok, kopi and toast for the past 70 years. By night, this neighborhood favorite transforms into a brand new yakitori and steamboat bar, Bincho. Go for either the $50 or $80 yakitori omakase menus, and enjoy a cocktail or two. If a unique setting and experience is what you\'re looking for, this might just be it. 
The squid was sweet, tender and expertly grilled. Served with scallion and mayo.
Grilled chicken livers served with grain and smooth mustard
Fresh cubes of tuna and salmon sashimi, seared tuna, delicately sweet salmon roe and pickled ginger sitting atop a bed of perfectly cooked japanese rice. Oishi!
Extremely value for money don set lunch! Comes with your choice of don(pick from tsukune, oyako, kaisen), appetizer, pickles, karaage, chicken soup and dessert. The appetizer and dessert varies and I got crispy chicken salad for appetizer and a refreshing melon sorbet dessert. $25 for Kaisen don and $20 for the rest.
Pate, toast, cucumber, long bean in miso n chic with berry sauce. The pate is good!
Cucumber was forgettable but daikon was wonderfully sweet
Dining partner said was not bad :)
This time at a secluded inconspicuous corner of Tiong Bahru. Noodle by day and bar by nite.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Old fashioned fishball noodles. Alittle springy noodles with alittle seasonings. Minced pork more well seasoned. Best to request for more chilli as it will definitely lift up the overall taste. Soup was light perhaps too light which is suitable for those who wants a lighter cleaner taste.
#binchosg #salmonsashimi #sashimi #tsukune #yakitori Come if you\'re feeling generous and ready to splurge. Thankfully it\'s 1-for-1 on #entertainerapp
#eggporn #tsukune with #egg This was probably the best dish of the night for me, as part of the #binchoexpress. The patty was very tender, and the egg was surprisingly palatable, making the whole concoction even smoother (I had my reservations with it being raw). #bincho #yakitori
Like next level fucking amazing.. Thank you @pengloh !
A whole new ball game for me - soft bone, gizzard, tail. #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgeats #burpple #burpplesg #binchosg #unlistedcollection #unlistedchefs

The equivalent of giving your mouth an uplifting and rejuvenating soak - complete with herby and fruity aromatherapy - in the lavish bathtub of a suite in New Majestic Hotel or similar.
Sharing it with good friends is sometimes sweeter than having it all to yourself. #burpple #foodphotography #foodporn #binchosg #rawegg #philosophical #bekindtooneanother
U simply just enjoy the night even if it means eating cod milk aka cod sperm. #burpple #goodcompany #foodphotography #foodporn #codmilk #eeeeeats
Great flavour and grilled to perfection 
Quite bland and lots of bones
Deelicious! 
Quite average
On a scarier note, I dreamt that I was baking for Gordan Ramsay last night😟

Sweet caramel pudding coupled with savory sea urchin served chilled, is a refreshing dessert from @binchosg that I wouldnt have expected myself to love it until I tried it! \n<br />#beatricewandertales #thefeedfeed  #vscofood #burpple #openricesg #f52grams\n<br />#onthetable #hungrygowhere #foodstagram #eatoutsg #foodporn #foodie #foodgasm #tagsforlikes #singapore #igsg #sgig #foodpics #foodphotography #binchosg #desserts #dessert #pudding #uni #japanese
Quite gelak after awhile. 
In my opinion, not the best I\'ve tried. 
Tskune dipped with egg yolk

Silky smooth without a single bubble to wrinkle its countenance. I wish I had skin like that. On another note, I was so taken with the adorably quaint cutlery! 😍 
Old school. #binchosg #bincho #burpple
We had our 4th anni dinner at this quaint jap place that\'s converted from an old shophouse selling meepok. During the day it sells the famous hua bee meepok and at night, it\'s transformed into a yakitori restaurant with a bar. #bincho #yakitori #japanese #foodie #yum
Nice touch to the sign. Entrance is at the back where the carpark is.
A beautiful end to a wonderful dinner. 
The sauce has bits of yuzu peel.. Something unique and appetizing. I like it!
Only 3 set menus at the moment, with free-flow salad, rice and tea. Restaurant is set in an old corner tiong bahru shop with a mix bag for designer and kopitiam furniture.
