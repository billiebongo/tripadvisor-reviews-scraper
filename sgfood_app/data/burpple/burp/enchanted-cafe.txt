Tried the Ngoh Hiang Burger ($18.90) with Scrambled Eggs (+ $3), and it was pretty amazed at how the patty tasted! Very rich in flavourful which makes every mouthful satisfying!\n<br />Also, Truffle Mayo Fries ($7.90). The truffle mayo dip was absolutely great too!
The Sorcerer\'s Elixir ($9.90), fancy drink with a fancy set up. Flavour was pretty good actually! 👍🏻
The toast is so soft and fluffy, well mixed with their caramelised banana, nutella spread and a scoop of vanilla ice cream! So yummy! 😋\n<br />.\n<br />#ReikoVSFood #burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders #nomsterofficial #potd #picoftheday #love #foodie #instadaily #instafood #throwbackphoto #enchantedcafe #dessert
Overall, their food is really nice! We had big breakfast, mushroom aglio olio, buffalo bites and truffle fries! Not forgetting all their interesting sorcerer drink! 😆 I would love to go back there and try other stuff on the menu again!\n<br />.\n<br />#ReikoVSFood #burpple #eatoutsg #nomsterofficial #instadaily #potd #picoftheday #love #throwbackphoto #enchantedcafe #foodie

nice pasta, interesting drinks !! ☺️
A secret purplish liquid poured over with earl grey tea.. transforming it into a dark brownish elixir which glimmered in the light. A lemony, hint of lychee and an evident presence of the earl grey. It was not overly sweet as I had requested for less syrup. 🔹🔹\n<br />The dry ice effect portrays a witch\'s brew from a fairytale. It was indeed mystical and I felt like sitting on a broom with a pointed hat and flying off into the blue sky. \n<br />#earlgreytea #fairytales #magical #teatime #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #stfoodtrending #nomnom #sgfoodies #sgfollowers #bloggersg #cafesg #cafehoppers #instafollowers #instafoodsg #thebestfoodphotography #beverages

Some people show disdain towards its herbal undertones but its nutty fragrance can be appealing to others.\n<br />The essence of basil is present in the pesto spread here but it is not overpowering and its viscosity is rather addictive.\n<br />Alongside the smoked salmon and crispy baked baguette, this bite side snack is pleasantly flavoursome. .\n<br /> 88 Rangoon Road\n<br />Singapore 218374\n<br />.\n<br />Opening Hours \n<br />Tues-Fri: 11.00am -10.00pm\n<br />Sat-Sun: 11.00am - 11.00pm\n<br />Mon closed\n<br />.\n<br />Damage: $8.90\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #instafoodie #cafehoppingsg #nomnom #foodstagram #singapore #igfoodies #instafood_sg #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #instasg #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #whati8today #openrice #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg
