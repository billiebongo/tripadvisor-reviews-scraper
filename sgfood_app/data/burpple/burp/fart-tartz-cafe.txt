we decided to try the Cookie Butter Oreo \"Mud\" Tart [$5.50] (NEW) &amp; the Sea-salt Nutella Short Tart [$6.80].\n<br />first of all, both the \"mud\" tart and the jar tart look very photogenic and instagram worthy 😍 a great place to get really nice food photos! good food is all about presentation now i guess 👅\n<br />the \"mud\" tart was something like a tiramisu, but with bits of speculoos inside, and oreo crumbs on the top. the cookie butter wasn\'t that strong, but the speculoos bits helped to bring the flavour out. yummy! \n<br />the jar tart had a combination of lots of stuff, from nutella to biscuit crumbs. i could taste the sea-salt at the top, but slowly died down as i went deeper into the jar. however, i really loved the combination of biscuit crumbs with nutella! \n<br />this place was a little hard to find, and it closes too early (6pm on mon-thurs, 8pm on fri-sun)! we almost didn\'t make it in time. i\'ll be back for sure to try their spaghetti in a jar because it looks very interesting!
Situated at 1 expo drive, a bit of distance from mrt station but worth to drop by and have this delicious mud tart in a quiet place ♡
The cake in the flower pot was great. They drew a little something on the coffee I had which was also great. Nice quiet place with good cakes a s coffee.
.\n<br /> It\'s unusual to serve pasta cold, but this one is an exception. The tangy sauce with thin slices of cucumbers created a burst of flavours in my mouth... 🙆🏻🙆🏻🙆🏻\n<br />.\n<br />Wishing everyone a great and sunny Saturday!! ☀️☀️☀️
Nutella Oreo \'Mud\' Tart $5.50\n<br />Sea-Salt Nutella Short Tart $6.80
Chilled Prawn Angel\'s Hair 》$11.90\n<br />Capellini pasta, tossed with in-house flavored sauce, olive oil, sesame, parsley, Japanese cucumber, fresh prawns, scallop &amp; shredded nori
✔️Flower Pot dessert (snickers Oreo mud tart) $5.50 ✔️Earl Grey Pistachio cake in a jar $6.80.         🍰🌷🌼
Earl Grey cake in a jar is better than the baileys. 
#throwback a pretty pastel [#SG50 #MudTart S$6.80] - specially for the jubilee weekend, so, now don\'t have already sorry 😁
As well as 2 jar tarts, matcha sesame azuki and bubblegum flavour - exclusive only for this golden jubilee weekend to celebrate #SG50. Majulah Singapuraaa 🇸🇬
It\'s been a while... And they have [Key Lime Tart S$6.80] now 😍😍 and its not sour at all👍🏻🐭🍋🍰
oven toasted prata like dough, lettuce, smoked duck and egg roe, ending with a generous drizzle of mayo.
Tasty desserts served creatively in flower pots and super cute small jars, the ambience of the cafe is really nice and aesthetics are just great (:
Smoked salmon flatbread ($14.50) and shroomy olio ($9.90). A hidden jem cafe in the east with great service and delicious food will definitely be back for more 😋 
Just a little far from me. Haha. #burpple #tingzieeats #tingziesgcafehopping @tangsher @leenzsim
Feeling sort of sheepish that I\'ve not been back to this lovely cafe for a while. Missing the food and the pretty jar desserts here. Here\'s Matcha Azuki Sesame to sweeten up my evening before dinner.
This place is too cute! Gimmicky flowerpot desserts are gimmicky but at least it tastes pretty good. Fragrant Pandan Gula Melaka, topped with oreo. And a cup of Rose tea to keep me warm on this rainy day.
A lovely weekend with lovely people brunch in this lovely cafe.  An open concept cafe located at expo hall between hall 2 and 3 opposite The Coffee Bean. Reasonable prices ,relaxing environment and good food, will definitely go back again !
Blueberry Oreo cheese cake act like a plants . Looks good and taste not so bad 
[Teriyaki Chicken Pasta S$10.90] - 很爱 the teriyaki chicken here!
Much needed at the end of the day. 🍭 [Azuki Matcha Sesame S$6.80] - my favourite matcha item here!
Every hour we feel like munching something. [Grilled Nori Tori S$8.50] - comes with vegetables but we opt for no veg😝
it\'s nice how the tables are white with wooden interior (which gives off a really nice feel)  and not to mention their presentation of food! how cute is it to have your pasta in a jar (the food isn\'t bad too!) and your cheesecake in a flower pot soiled with oreo sprinkled on top with a finish of a flower? it\'s too pretty to be eaten! 
CNY approaching so quickly in 4 days! Even my dessert became so Chinese New Year-ish😝🎍
- fArtz Tartz (simply amazing together with the ambience and space)
Possibly the prettiest, if not definitely the tastiest no-bake tart jar desserts I came across so far. It comes in more than 10 flavours. Have you tried them yet? 
Tasty with a considerably generous amount of smoked duck, fish roe and garlic. All pastas come with a salad on the side with a dash of balsamic vinegar~.                                                                     Read my full review showcasing other dishes at http://tengtengzxc.blogspot.sg/2015/02/fart-tartz-review.html?m=1
Think, smoked duck with a less oily version of aglio olio, and the popping of fish roe with every bite.
#lastgram2014 \n<br />This year seemed kinda slow, yet kinda fast. Great things happened, ate lots of good food (see photo above 😏), met some really nice people. At the same time, shits happened, people are disappointing, screwed some stuffs up. But that\'s life, I guess.
I tookaway a jar of earl grey misu and baileys choc. My sister and I are huge suckers for baileys dessert and we really loved the Bailey choc one which was just so smooth and creamy with the right amount of baileys. Personally I feel that the earl grey misu is just average and could have been better if there was more sponginess from the cake instead of being overpowered by cream. Perhaps the tiramisu one would be a better choice but that\'s something that I can\'t vouch for as of yet. Would definitely be back to try the other stuffs as they have a really nice peaceful area. 
Good morning!! Had a lovely glass of [ICED HAZELNUT LATTE S$7.20] and a Christmas Cat 3D bonus surprise from Jessica 😝, Christmas Tree I plucked from my potted dessert. The whole drink is so Christmasy! Good mood today because of this! 😍😍
Their cheesecakes are disguised as potted plants, the \"soil\" is actually oreo crumbs. You get to keep the fake flower too! And inside we tried the normal cheesecake and also the matcha cheesecake. It\'s quite a small portion to be honest, just enough for one person. It\'s is quite soft and smooth, more like a mousse than a dense cheesecake
I had fun twirling some of the pasta around the tines of a fork.
Finally made my way to the \"Far East\" and it\'s worth my journey.
Chilled Angel Hair Prawn Pasta ($10.90)\n<br />Spicy Black Pepper Chix Linguine ($12.90)
Pasta is in jar, it\'s very nice. Coffee is not very strong, and taste not bad as well.
Cafe with a garden theme. Plastic flowers in cans, flower pots, etc, bed of plastic flowers acting as dividers and even their desserts came in flower pots.
It\'s interesting to be eating a flower pot with crushed Oreo as the \'mud\' and cream cheese as the soil. And the Nutella seemed to be the water soil. It was an alternating layer of cream cheese, Nutella and Oreo bits, with the base ending with the crushed Oreo. Not too bad. Basically it\'s Oreo cheesecake. Goes for $5.50 each 
The presentation of food is unique, spaghetti in the jar is interesting. It serve in small amount, food consider average. Peaceful environment. I am more into their desserts, very special and interesting. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Both the Mud Tarts; Oreo Nutella &amp; Mocha O taste great and special. They looked so real like flowers / plants... Aside the flower pot is yours after purchase. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
At first glance, this Mocha \'O\' Mud Tart ($5.50) may seem like a pot of flower. However, it is actually a no-bake dessert that consist of mocha powder covering the top, with the base tasting similar to Oreo!
Nice and quiet place to chill and enjoy the view from the sofa. They have interesting bottled tea drink which is light and refreshing. The cakes in jars are simply awesome! Check out their wide range of tarts too! Worth a try! Definitely a hidden gem in Expo.

It\'s sure is refreshing but find it rather hard to move the utensils freely. Taste wise, I would say it\'s above average as the pasta is packed with chilli padi, prawns, clams, and other ingredients. This is more to the spicy side so be prepared to sweat !😳\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#spaghetti#pasta#sambal#cafesg#seafoodpasta#foodie#eatsg#delicious#farttartz#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#expo#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Its flaky crunchy texture and the nice aroma it gives out with every bite makes me feel content
Seafood is fresh but the spiciness level disappoints
Simple hot beverage to awake the sleepy time.
Beautiful latte art and yummy desserts in a jar!

Grilled hot wings (SGD8.50) which are mid-joints seasoned with honey and herbs. Not overly spicy but nicely marinated, we love these wings! 👍👍
Here\'s a #throwback to a cafe that we visited previously. Loads of light, space and very away from the crowds.

I ordered cold capellini with shrimps (S$11.90) served with salad. At first I was skeptical about this dish but it turned out awesome! Sweet and sour, harmoniously create a balanced flavour. The pepper chix linguine (S$10.90) was awesome too.
