Creamier definitely lives up to its hype - both the waffles and the ice cream were amazing!! I love my waffles thick, crispy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside. Pistachio is one of Creamier\'s bestsellers and worth ordering over and over again. Not everyone would like having Peanut Butter and Jelly (PB&amp;J) as an ice cream flavor but I love it!!! I think Imma just stick to these 2 flavors for life. 
One scoop of pistachio and one scoop of banana ice cream sitting on piping hot and crispy waffles. This winning combination of cold ice cream on hot fluffy waffles never fails, and the waffles here always keeps me coming back for more.
😂😂 White chocolate miso ice cream(served with a long strip of seaweed) - a very interesting flavor combination created by @lennardy. Love the crispiness and savoriness of the seaweed for the inviting textural contrast. Go before December ends! Of course, one scoop is never enough. I had to add on my favourite pistachio ice cream as well! 😁 #EileenWantsToCampHere #Creamier #CreamierSg #CreamierXLennardy #IceCream #SgCafe #Pistachio #Dessert #Sweet
Surprisingly light and milky with a mild savoury saltiness from the miso. I liked that it wasn\'t too sweet. Topped with crunchy Tao Kae Noi seaweed. Not one of their top flavours to me, but rather interesting. $4.50 per scoop.
Robust, strong espresso, and creamy Madagascar vanilla ice cream.
A delightful scoop of fragrant floral pandan kaya infused with lemongrass.
Crispy, fluffy waffles with Thai milk tea and Gula Melaka ice cream, liked that the flavours tasted quite true to the actual deal and wasn\'t too sweet. All the better when there\'s no queue!
[Burpple Tasty Tastemaker Tour Station 3 of 3: The Creamier]\n<br />🔸\n<br />The creators of Sunday Folks are also serving you their highly acclaimed ice cream at Creamier, at a much more affordable price compared to many gelatos.\n<br />🔸\n<br />These ice cream are freshly churned in small batches at -4 degrees (instead of the usual at -30 degrees) when the taste buds are still sensitive, so that the subtleties of the flavours can be spot on. What you get is a softer and smoother ice cream that\'s also creamy and milky.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The waffles here also has an eggy fragrance just like the one at Sunday Folks, but it is less crispy due to the higher humidity of the kitchen here. Those who prefer their waffles to be more chewy may like this though.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Thanks to @creamier_sg for having us that afternoon, @burpple for organizing the #TastyTastemakerTour and @jiaknonstop for leading it! This concludes my posting at all three stations of the tour, thanks for journeying with us! 😋😋😋
A whole new experience on my long overdue (looks like it\'s been close to 2 years😱) visit to creamier with the Burpple community.                                                      While I was reminded of many past visits with other \"ice cream X waffles enthusiast\" (aka my JC gfs and mum) to the ice cream parlor, and my forever conventional order of their remarkable earl grey lavender X crispy dense waffles; today I was treated to a variety of flavors (PB&amp;J and Madagascar Vanilla quickly becoming new favorites? 😬) and got invaluable insights from one of the owners herself. \n<br />*phew long sentence*\n<br />I learnt 1. Creamier still makes their own ice cream from what they promise are fine/earnest/virtuous ingredients. Secretly confirming the picky eater I am (a fact I am not very proud of) of my choice 🙊. \n<br />2. Differences behind the commonly used term \"soft serve\". \n<br />Thank you Burpple for a foodie good time once again!!! 
if you like crispy waffles that don\'t get chewy then creamier / sunday folks have just the waffle you\'re looking for! topped with smooth and creamy ice cream of all sorts of flavors, creamier is really your go to spot for dessert. Personal favorites are: thai milk tea, banana choc chip, earl grey and pb&amp;j!!! my whole fam is in love with the earl grey haha we never leave without a pint! 
Chocolate ice creams are often too creamy, too dark or too rich. The Good Ol\' Chocolate ($3.50) at Creamier was the right balance of everything! Slightly dark but yet creamy enough,it was a hit among the family members and I even regretted allowing my sister to finish it up! Lol.

#Waffles with a scoop of c richest dark #chocolate #ferrero and a scoop of #cookies and cream @ Creamier.
Creamier. $3 #EarlGrey #lavender was not not bad, nice fragrance of lavender. $3 #pistachio was the best I ever had, very intense roasted nutty pistachios, better than alfero\'s! Their tahitian #vanilla was ok, needs improvement, i won\'t want to pay extra again just because the vanilla is from tahiti, it\'s a magical place i know i know, Phil Coulson may agree with me 😁 😁 😁 , still prefer alfero\'s. What I like about their ice cream is they\'re not too sweet.
Paid $12.50 for double scoops with waffles! Not the cheapest around but it\'s really yummy! Strawberry lime Sorbet and Sea salt Gula Melaka 👍🏻 Crispy waffles 👍🏻 Non-peak hour crowd 👍🏻 Went there on a weekday evening before dinner- at least we were able to find seats. The place is pretty small so if you want seats, go during non-peak hours! 
One of the best waffles I\'ve ever had. Been here so many times and I\'ll always keep going back. Worth Travelling for. The best thing about this place is that they only have plain waffles, no fancy earl grey waffles or whatsoever. Sticking to traditions is sometimes better cos you can never go wrong with the basics. However, the only down side is space constraints. It\'s a very small cafe with limited seatings. The place is always crowded so be prepared to wait awhile before getting a seat. Price of waffles with 1 scoop of ice cream: $8.50. Waffle level: 10/10 
Piping hot, crunchy waffles; drizzled with honey and chocolate sauce &amp; topped with the most marvellous Mochacinno + Earl Grey Lavendar ice cream. Creamier offers a huge selection of ice-cream flavors, ranging from the popular Thai Milk Tea to Pistachio to Sea Salt Gula Melaka, and of course the humble Madagascar Vanilla. Sorbets are available too! Albeit the space might be a tad cosy, the ambience is just bustling of life and energy! Walk in from 3-5 pm to avoid having to wait for seats. Definitely serves up the best hand-crafted ice cream; always keep coming back for more and more 😛
When one is in Toa Payoh, one cannot miss out on paying a visit to this always crowded cafe even on a weekday. This small cafe is tucked at a corner of a residential estate. Even on a weekday night it is bustling with people but we didn\'t wait long to get a seat. Set my eyes straight on the Thai milk tea and Gula Melaka with sea salt to go with our waffles($11.60). The Thai milk tea tasted just like Thai milk tea? I mean I would rather I went for a vanilla flavor for the same reason yes? However both my girlfriend and I loved the Gula Melaka flavor, wasn\'t overly sweet or salty and it was mysteriously attractive. You just can\'t stop. Waffles were crispy and drizzled with chocolate and maple sauce on the side. Don\'t know why having such a modern dessert, staring at the nolstagic playground and talking about life seems to fit into therapeutic here. Will definitely head back for their waffles and other flavored ice cream.
Thai iced tea / Sea salt gula melaka 💯 Will definitely make a come back to try other flavours. Their gelato are so YUMMY! 
Very creamy ice cream with Hot crispy waffle. This portion is just right for 2!! 😍  You will totally love it if you like thick and rich Ice cream. #icecreamwaffle 
crispy golden waffles with generous scoops of earl grey &amp; pistachio ice-cream, drizzled all over with caramel &amp; chocolate sauce. still affordable, and still super creamy &amp; gooood!
Here is a breakdown of what\'s on my plate. Waffles (S$6) + single scoop cookies-n-cream (S$2.80) + single scoop Pistachio ($2.80 + $0.90 for premium flavour). Love my Pistachio ice-cream which has a mild nutty fragrant with the right sweetness (not overly sweet). His cookies-n-cream was less milky and less sweet when compared to previously.
Having icecream at Creamer before lunch and after dinner on the same day😆😂 We were really in an I-know-I-shouldnt-but-its-creamier situation, but ultimately gave in to temptation (without much hesitation haha!). This place still holds the no. 1 place in my heart for icecream and waffles, so how could I possibly say no? Unfortunately, it means I definitely can\'t say no to going to the gym tomorrow 😂
Had a Thai milk tea ice cream cone instead because the waiting time for waffles is 40mins 😰 ! Prefer the one here cause other shop\'s ☝ is just too sweet &gt;
Especially crowded during the weekends, you will be expected to queue in line to share a table with other diners. The four ice cream flavours that we ordered include the Sea Salt Gula Melaka, Thai Milk Tea, Roasted Pistachio and my all-time favourite Earl Grey Lavender. Everything about this cafe just gives out an aura that allures people from all over Singapore to travel here just to have a taste of this magnificent dessert.
Digging into Creamier waffles and ice cream ($12 for double scoop) yesterday afternoon with the food friends. I still think the roasted pistachio, earl grey lavendar and salted caramel gula Melaka flavours were among the best. We also tried the Thai iced tea flavour, which was too sweet and didn\'t have a strong enough tea fragrance. Warning, Creamier is forever crowded so be patient as you wait for a seat. Also, featuring Burpple Tastemaker Felicia Sim\'s hand and sparkly nails 😍
Finally jumped on the bandwagon and tried out the long-popular waffles with a presentation that it can call it\'s own. Just nice - fluffly - though I prefer my waffles crispier and of more burnt-brown. I looked longingly at the ones devoured by my neighbouring patrons, which were much more of the \"correct\" colour than mine. We tried the Butterscotch &amp; Almond, and Sea Salt Gula Melaka favoured ice-creams and they are like the cafe\'s name, creamier than many artisan ice-creams I have tried. Not for those who don\'t like their dessert too sweet. Nonetheless, we we\'re well-cooled-off upon leaving the cafe. Crazy weather today.
Creamier, nestled in a little corner of Toa Payoh has established its name well in the ice cream cone towers. Make sure you order their popular flavours -- Pistachio, Sea salt caramel, and my personal favourite Earl Grey Lavender 😋\n<br />Waffles-wise, I would prefer Merely Ice Cream\'s waffles which has a more fragrant, buttery familiarity to it.
Always my favorite waffle place. Their ice cream is to die for, so is the waffle. There\'s no words that could describe my love towards their ice cream and waffle.
The crackling crunch of the waffles are deserving of an award on their own - even more so when considering the chewy, dense, yet fluffy inside it hides. I loved the ice cream too (tried most over the counter!). Strangely though, while the flavours were intense and lovely on the first taste, they were muted when eaten with the waffles AND chocolate AND syrup. There were too many things going on and the stellar flavours just slid into the background. What a pity. I really quite liked the horlicks.
The ice cream here is really good with a wide range of flavours, so there should be something for everyone to enjoy :) the waffles aren\'t great, but they\'re pretty good. It\'s also quite affordable ($8.50 for 2 waffles and 1 scoop of ice cream- $2.50 extra for an extra scoop). 
Every time I try to make a trip there, it\'s too crowded to even go in. Other than having two of their signature flavours, Earl Grey Lavender and Sea Salt Gula Melaka, we had their waffles with Strawberry Lime Sorbet 🍓 and Orange 🍊 Cranberry Vodka. Now I can see what the hype is all about.
Ordered the green tea (again!) and butterscotch almond ice cream. Ice creams were still top notch, but the waffle standard seems to have dropped a little 😕, it feels less dense than before. 
I wish I lived in Toa Payoh / Braddell so I can have the ice cream here whenever I want 😭
We selected Butterscotch and Pistachio flavoured ice cream to go along with the nicely done waffles! Yumms!
I was surprised it wasn\'t crowded today, probably because it was a weekday. We ordered Waffles with Sea Salt Gula Melaka &amp; Plain Ole Chocolate ($11.80). Instantly, I fell in love with the chocolate. It was so smooth and creamy! The Sea salt Gula Melaka went complemented the dark chocolate very well! This was a great combo. However, I was stuck with only very few options because most of the flavours were premium ones (+90c per scoop). The waffles were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside! Would love to come back again! 
Creamier - waffles with Thai milk tea and earl grey lavender ice cream 🌞  \n<br />Their earl grey lavender is a classic I always go for and it never disappoints with a light floral aftertaste and distinct earl grey flavour. \n<br />Thai milk tea is a new flavour and it\'s sweet, as expected and I really enjoyed it with the waffles! Ah, the waffles, they were crispy on the outside and yet soft and fluffy on the inside; perfect with the cold of the ice cream! However, I was disappointed by the service, (like always) Creamier and its sister ice cream parlour Sunday Folks have been constantly slow and messy at my multiple visits and its always a dilemma for me, are their waffles and ice cream worth the stress of ordering and queueing up? 
Enjoying a quiet wafflelicious date. The waffles here at Creamier are simply soft and fluffy. The ice-cream is just too good, really the best in town! Definitely my to-go place for those late night ice-cream cravings.
The queue is long, the place is small and there\'s limited seating but the turnover is quite fast, and there are seats at the playground outside. The waffles are nice, crispy and a tad sweet. I ordered Thai Milk Tea, Earl Grey Lavender and Banana Chocolate Chip Crumble. The Earl Grey is good. Thai Milk Tea and Banana tasted like their names literally. It\'s quite good though.
Get past the perpetually long queue and be rewarded with crisp waffles that I just can\'t get enough of. Fav scoops are the fragrant Thai Milk Tea, Roasted Pistachio and Banana Choc Chip Crumble.
A second visit to the praised ice-cream parlour hidden within the housing estate in Toa Payoh, I was surprised to see that Creamier was filled quickly even though it was late afternoon on a weekday and still drawing a endless crowd. Spoiled for choices, I found some of the ice cream selection really unique so be sure to sample first and there will definitely be one for you from the wide range of flavours. 
($13.80, I think) \n<br />The flavors are Earl Grey Lanvander(Top), Thai ice milk tea (Left), Kopi C (Right). If you haven\'t been and try it you are missing out!👀😝 Hahaha ending UNI hectic school week with my favorite ice creams!❤️ hope you guys have an AWESOME Friday too!!
Shown here are their green tea, pistachio and sea salt gula melaka ice creams. I\'m especially in love with the sea salt gula melaka ice cream, boasting a creamier texture, salty sweet flavour and slight hints of smokiness from the gula melaka. \n<br />#burpple #icecream #dessert #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #sgcafescene
earl grey lavender is da bomb.
Indeed, Creamier lives up to its name. Like Sunday Folks, square waffles are also served here. I picked Honey Lemon Yuzu as I wanted a refreshing flavour for a hot hazy day.
The owners open this shop first then open Sunday Folks in Holland. This is where it births forth. That\'s why you see how the waffles are, it\'s actually similar. Sunday Folks ice cream is actually soft serve. I would prefer these handcrafted ice cream more than soft serve. It give a more \"chewy\" texture. The wide range of flavours are brilliantly created. Earl Grey Lavender is nice. Roasted pistachio has this hint of smokiness. Sea salt Gula Melaka is sweet and at the same time has a hint of saltiness in contrast to the taste. So genius-ly created. I\'m so spoiled for choices. Last time I tried Sunday Folks, the waffle was a little disappointing, I guess the outlet was rather new then and the consistency was lacking. Creamier redeems themselves with this waffle I had. There\'s this girl that faithfully does all the waffles at the waffle station. Looking at how she works, very detailed and fast at the same time. I will choose creamier anytime! And maybe, I should visit Sunday Folks to give it a try again. #creamier #icecream #waffle #dessert #sweets
#🍦 flavours we had:\n<br />- Mango-Passionfruit\n<br />- Sea Salt Gula Melaka\n<br />- Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly\n<br />- Earl Grey Lavender\n<br />- Plain Ole Chocolate
☕️☕️ it was nice to eat breakfast here! Remember to come early as this place is forever crowded!
Quadruple the sweetness! Their hits are Earl Grey Lavender and Thai Milk Tea! Each scoop of their ice cream so smooth, full bodied and creamy. Flavors were intense yet light, perfect match with fluffy waffle that has a crispy edge. 
Don\'t waste time pouring through the menu. Go straight for the salted caramel and peanut butter ice cream. Probably the best around! 
Awesome ice cream with freshly made waffle. The aroma of the freshly baked waffle made the waiting feel like eternal
3 munchies: The fluffy waffles served here are no doubt one of the best, my second visit was unfortunately a disappointing one. Not only the sea salt gula melaka ice cream was a tad creamy, it was also way too salty! Even though I\'m not a fan of Earl Grey tea, the Iavender-infused ice cream on top was at the very least edible. I thought the only thing that was worth the 25-min walk from Lorong 7 to Lorong 1 Toa Payoh for this was the company of five other Tastemakers from the Hawkerpedia team.
Thai milk tea x Ferrero//love the Japanese green tea but they didn\'t have it :( 
The gula melaka taste stood out but the milk tea didn\'t managed to leave an impression. Nevertheless, it\'s still not stopping the office men and ladies to come queue during lunch hour.
Waffles with Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly and Black Sesame Ice Cream! Still as good as before and I love how they always have new interesting flavours! They\'ve got a new one that\'s called White Miso Almond. 
On days like these, some waffles and ice cream will do wonders. It\'s like a yin and yang kinda thing that no one really knows why waffles is able to pair so well with ice cream, especially if it\'s Earl Grey Lavender flavour. Some say Creamier, some say Sunday Folks. To me, both also can lah.
Earl grey lavender was really good! Place was rather small but table turnover was fast. Would like to try other flavours in the future :)
The waffles are here really to die for!!!! There is quite a variety of ice cream flavours to choose from as well.. Though the cafe space is not big and the wait might be long, it\'s definitely worthwhile.. Highly recommended.. :)
I know that I am pretty slow! Haha but now I know why people are willing to wait and queue for this place. The smell of that heavenly waffles, waltz and dance around me, and I already got really excited. You simply don\'t get it anywhere. It was beautiful. Crisp on the outside, and uber fluffy on the inside, Creamier seriously know their waffle. I do have to say it\'s one the best so far, that I have tried. The ice cream were all so wholesome that it\'s hard to pick your favourite. Freshly made and thick, each mouthful of the ice cream is rich and wonderful. Now it\'s my go-to-place when I am around the area. 👍🏻
Do yourself a favour and try this new flavour! My absolute favourite here is the sea salt gula Melaka but maybe not anymore... But then again, I love peanut butter so I might be a teenie weenie bit biased! 
Was disappointed that both the rum and raisin and blackforest liqueur flavours lack alcohol. But I could see why the waffles are so popular here with the slight exterior crisp, though I personally prefer the crunchier kind. #burpple 
If you\'re looking for waffles which are thick and crispy, you gotta try the famous Waffles from Creamier. Earl Grey Lavender and Thai Milk Tea are their signature flavors. 
Braved the snaking queue for an #icecream orgy plus this waffles duo of Banana Chocolate Crumble and Sea Salt Gula Melaka. Redolent of fresh bananas, it\'s the former that did it for me, hands down. Try also the Thai Iced Milk Tea flavour. Superbly fragrant, it\'s almost like the real deal. The waffles were excellent, boasting a crisp-fluffy texture and heady vanilla-infused notes. 
Kick ass waffles with creamy home made ice cream. Creamier indeed. 
Handcrafted ice cream and waffles from creamier ice cream and coffee.
The waffles are equally good comparing to Sunday Folks. However, they\'ve got more choices for the ice cream. Salted Caramel, Orange Vodka and I\'ve forgotten the other one. It was a worthy trip for me to travel all the from Jurong to Toa Payoh just for these awesome ice cream 👍🏻
This is the best ice cream and waffles I\'ve tasted so far. The waffles were perfectly crispy and cooked through and the earl grey lavender ice cream was really refreshing with the right amount of sweetness and creaminess. For two waffles and a scoop of ice cream it cost me $8.80 which I think is pretty worth it if u compare the price with other ice cream bars with waffles that don\'t even taste that good. I really recommend this
Had to be here since I am around the area. Butterscotch Almond is a premium flavour which comes milky with a hint of torched caramel to create the butterscotch flavour. Always liked the nutty flavours here because they come with that hint of roasted nuts; in this case almonds which is toasty and gives the crunch.
After having hokkien mee and fish soup at Lorong 1, decided to have one of my favourite ice creams. Really love their salted gula melaka! It\'s not overly sweet and had a nice gula melaka flavour.
While we enjoyed the salty flavour, the black forest tasted largely of chocolate and lacked an alcoholic punch. The generosity of the serving portion was more than enough to compensate though!
Waffle batter in sg is usually tasteless or a bit savory but the waffles served in this neighborhood cafe are a little on the sweet side. Texture wise quite dense, and slightly crunchy skin. More skin per waffle as these are smaller than the usual cafe ones. 
Waffle with Earl Grey lavender ice cream (creamy ice cream infused with French earl grey tea and hints of lavender notes) ($8.80) for brunch. \n<br />Not bad with a table all to myself.\n<br />Although the waffle is crispy outside, inside it is not the soft and fluffy type. It\'s more of a kueh kueh texture.
One of the early forerunners of the waffle craze, it still manages to remain popular amongst the crowded waffle and ice cream market. The waffles are light, staying crispy on the outside, yet soft and fluffy on the inside. It actually tasted good as well, unlike many others that are quite bland and dry. My favourite ice cream had to be the sea salt gula melaka, which switches things up a little from the more typical salted caramel and provides a little local flavour. The black forrest was not impressive, and tasted like normal chocolate ice cream. Overall, still one of the better waffles out there and really popular judging from the crowd. 
This one was topped with sea salt &amp; gula melaka and earl grey lavender scoops. 
Only my first time at Creamier because it\'s so out of the way for me - but man was it memorable. The waffles are GOOD. The ice cream flavours and textures are GREAT. This was a standard waffle set with a double scoop of roasted pistachio and milk &amp; honey with peaches (the daily special). The waffles stayed crispy throughout and are packed with flavour, unlike many airy, tasteless ones i\'ve had before. 
You can always count on Creamier for good ice cream and waffles. If you love ice cream or waffles and haven\'t been here, you\'re doing it all wrong. The ice cream here is exceedingly creamy, smooth and dense, and the waffles are crispy, fluffy and eggy. Go for the Banana Chocolate Chip Crumble, Thai Milk Tea and Roasted Pistachio — almost every flavour is good, actually. However, Creamier is also known to be awfully packed all the time due to space constraints, so it\'ll do you good to visit during off-peak hours!
Right: Mochacino and left: Sea salt gula melaka | This\'ll always be one of my fave go-to ice cream places with amazing premium flavours (and waffles!) at fair prices :-) Pity the seating space is limited. 
Instead of my usual Earl Grey Lavender, decided to try a new flavor, butterscotch almond. Love the butterscotch flavor that\'s not too sweet and the crunchy bits of almond slivers! 
Whats better than waffles? Waffles with Ice cream! There are many interesting flavors to choose from. You might want to skip the weekends because there\'s always a crowd. 
Good waffles with ice-cream! Similar to Sunday folks! But prefer Sunday folks ice cream more hehe! 
I am not a sweet tooth person but this is the best waffle and ice cream I had tried so far.
Creamier is always crowded. I really love the Thai milk tea ice cream, it is so good that I must have it when I\'m there. :) 
Big fan of bananas &amp; strawberries and both the flavours and the waffles were PERFECT for me. Got these at $12.50 &amp; I was really satisfied even tho I had to wait 10min for a seat. The small store is just not enough reason to stop me from coming again. I will be back ^^ 
😘Earl grey lavender icecream + crispy waffles!! Their waffles are really crisp &amp; to my liking! Match together with their big scoop of icecream &amp; syrup=perfect😘 MUST TRY! 
Quite possibly the best ice-cream &amp; waffles I\'ve ever had! 
The ice cream is creamy balance flavor and waffles are crispy but soft inside Rating 😍 My rating system. 😍 shiok must return 😜 shiok only if you are in the neighborhood 👎don\'t bother. 
Seems a bit overdone and slightly bitter .. Maybe it\'s the beans?  ($6.00)
Thumbs up for presentation even though I think pricing is on the expensive side. But they have really cool flavours such as roasted pistachio and earl grey lavender! I thought the waffles were really good and it went very well with their ice cream. But it\'s always packed and it\'s really really difficult to get a space there~ 
What\'s good on a cold, rainy, sweater weather day? A plateful of warm and crispy waffles, topped with an ice cream of your choice! Accompanied with a cup of hot chocolate... Uhumm! Located at the heartlanders, Toa Payoh, totally a hidden gem. Here, featuring the salted gula melaka ice cream, earl grey lavender ice cream and plain ole chocolate! It doesn\'t go wrong! 
Part 2. Yuzu and pistachio ice cream sitting on tops of fluffay waffles! 
Need to say more about this awesome place selling fluffy waffles and exotic flavoured ice cream? Try it if you haven\'t and you will fall in love, I guarantee. 
Love the crispy waffle!! Thai ice tea and salted gula Melaka~ yummy!! Definitely will visit again. Price: $8.80 for waffle and one ice cream, $2.80 for extra scoop  
I was there on a week day, got a table easily and there wasn\'t any queue. Place was slightly cramp but anything for those waffles right? Waffles were really crisp and soft in the middle, love that they have this sweet aroma. Smell plays a huge part when eating. Ice cream didn\'t melt that quickly either. 
And we got a free scoop of ice cream some more! Hahaha! \n<br />Yum! Will try sunday folks soon but diet comes first ☝️
Roasted Pistachio (the best I\'ve tried) x Mochaccino Damn good! #blueblackwhiteeats
What can goes wrong with these ever rich, ever creamy and ever smooth ice cream paired with a couple of fluffy waffle? Each scoop of ice cream is rich in their own flavors! For instance earl grey has a rich with tones of earl grey flavor yet tasted refreshing. Awesome ice cream parlor! (:
The gula melaka ice cream and green tea ice cream were yummylicious! The gula melaka wasn\'t really sweet as I thought it would be which was 👍! Pair them up with squared waffles and you\'ll feel like you\'re on cloud 9!
It was our first visit, and it was love at first taste for us! Creamier is doing a fantastic job with \'common\' flavours like strawberries and vanilla! Let\'s just say you will never find them predictable and boring, because we are leaving the tasting for you! Totally sold and calling it our TGIF comfort food from today onwards. It\'s abit of a drive, a little of a queue but trust us, it\'s worth the extra mile! (pun intended)
Cafe is popular and that it is small, we did not expect it to be full house even on a weekday. The Earl Grey Lavendar ice cream which had a unique lavendar after taste, was fragrant and creamy, their waffles was too dry for my liking. 
The Cranberry Orange Vodka #icecream paired well with the fragrant waffles! \n<br />Unfortunately I probably won\'t come back another time.. \'Coz the shop was simply overcrowded; we literally finished eating &amp; scrambled out coz it was getting too claustrophobic... Maybe when the place becomes more conducive? #rosCafeHops
Wonderful dessert. Freshly made waffles topped with semi-sweet chocolate and banana ice-cream. Divine. 
Can\'t get enough of their amazing waffles and ice cream. 
she likes earl grey while I prefer pistachio. she likes chocolate sauce yet I prefer maple syrup. we end up agreeing to all. \n<br />sweet treats to subdue bitter Monday. (I still stand my ground that their waffles ain\'t good 😂😂)
😝😝• [WAFFLES WITH PISTACHIO ICECREAM S$8.80 + extra scoop of EARL GREY LAVENDAR ICECREAM S$2.80 + premium flavour S$0.90] - should have ordered another scoop!
sea salt gula melaka @creamie_sg after a great hawker meal. ma soul has been cleansed. peace out y\'all. time for a Sunday nap. 😪😪
Thick waffles that are crsipy on the outside, soft and warm inside. Creamy handmade ice cream too!
Great flavours, amazing taste. Plenty of flavours to choose from, that I was spoilt for choice. Had to go with my favourites. The flavours were strong but not overwhelming. 👍👍
Their waffles is one of the best I had and their ice cream flavour are just too good 
Waffles topped with Mochaccino ice cream and Earl grey lavender tea 
Premium flavour ice cream with waffle. A single scoop will suffice for the two pieces of waffle! Honey lemon yuzu had a good mix of sweet and sour. ($9.70)
Having moved to the area recently, Creamier has fast becoming my favorite joints in Toa Payoh. Earl Grey Lavender is an all-time favorite and a must-have, and this time around, I tried a new flavor, Thai Iced Tea. Tastes exactly like the name suggests, but not too overtly sweet as most Thai iced teas are. Definitely a keeper. Oh, and did I mention they have one of the better waffles around too? 🍦
This is just half of it. Sea salt gula Melaka, roasted pistachio , earl grey lavender, Black Forest, Rum n raisin and banana.
Tried their best seller normal choc ice-cream with waffle and it was the best i ever had. Will come back for more!
Food coma from too many waffles and scoops of ice cream.
Definitely worth the possible queue and the hype! One of the best waffle-ice cream combinations I\'ve eaten. That scoop of ice cream is hugeeee
The waffles is crispy outside yet soft inside. Ice cream is nice. I like the earl grey lavender especially. 
time for a short break. here at creamier having their waffles and awesome gula melaka and banana choc chip ice cream. I still feel their waffles just ain\'t as good.
Finally made my way to Creamier, slightly tucked away at Toa Payoh. Mid afternoon, and it was packed with people digging into ice cream and waffles. Tried their popular Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Earl Grey Lavender ice cream with waffles. The former was a tad too sweet for my liking but the latter came out as a pleasant surprise. Love the  lavender after taste that complements well with notes of earl grey. Would definitely come back to try their other flavors too. 
Yay for Creamier. Too bad my favorite waffles from here ran out tonight😞
It had been listed to be one the comfort food for the teenagers nowadays. But who would like to have a cold ice cream plated with a freshly \"baked\" waffle, especially on a hot day?? Their ice cream was very creamy and thick. It could only be achieve if the ice cream had less than 30% air. Thus more milk/cream was needed, higher food cost! \n<br />The waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy in the inside. The instant the waffle hit the tongue, I could smell the strong aroma of egg + butter. If only, the waffle was bigger. 😬
Their flavors were so strong and \"real\". Unlike some stalls using chemical flavoring in their ice creams. \n<br />I just bite into one of the pistachio shell, so I pretty sure they used the real ingredients instead of powders. \n<br />Creamier \n<br />#01-835, 128 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 \n<br />Phone: 62501476 \n<br />Tue - Thu: 12:00 - 22:00\n<br />Fri - Sat: 12:00 - 23:00\n<br />Sun: 12:00 - 22:00\n<br />Closed: Mon
Wasn\'t very good. The flavor from the root beer and vanilla ice cream balanced out each other. Resulting the taste to be pretty blend. \n<br />I will prefer either one of them stand out. \n<br />Creamier \n<br />#01-835, 128 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 \n<br />Phone: 62501476 \n<br />Tue - Thu: 12:00 - 22:00\n<br />Fri - Sat: 12:00 - 23:00\n<br />Sun: 12:00 - 22:00\n<br />Closed: Mon
One of my favourite ice cream parlour. Quality of ice cream is very good - rich and creamy, not icy tastes fresh. Roasted pistachio is heavenly -  it\'s nutty and fragrant. Waffles are still crispy though they seem to have tweaked it such that it has more of the egg and bread taste. The place I go when I have waffles and ice cream craving!
Simply adored the earl grey tea and the horlicks infused ice cream to top it on the waffles crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Paired it with chamomile tea to \'hopefully\' counter the sinfulness of this very dessert. 
The 30 mins wait for the waffles + Thai Milk Tea and Banana Chocolate Chip ice cream was totally worth it!
If you\'re craving a good waffle and ice cream combo or even just a scoop of homemade ice cream, Creamier is the place to be! My friend C and I ordered their Belgium waffles topped with pistachio and thai milk tea ice cream. The waffles were nicely crisp and light, which went amazing well with the ice cream combo! I do highly recommend you try this place out! 
😁Have been coming here but there\'s always a long queue, which makes us detour. \n<br />Today we managed to get seats ✌️ This place is always so crowded! Even on weekdays #icecream #waffles #dessert
Had earl grey and salted gula melaka icecream atop 2 very fluffy waffles. Very yummy!!
This always happens to me no matter where I go. Just because I order more than 1 scoop of ice cream doesn\'t mean that I am sharing with anyone. #truestory #theyjustdontgetit
Crispy waffles and oh so nice ice cream. Earl grey lavender ice cream tastes amazing. Light and not too sweet. Chocolate ice cream tastes super thick. 😋😋 Nommms. I don\'t mind another serving!
Back at favourite to get waffle fix. The queue, oh the queue! I can cry. But no. Anyway, decided on the banana chocolate chip crumble ice-cream. It is a dream come true. Once it hits your tastebuds I\'m sure you can hear the singing angels. 
Got the earl grey lavender &amp; sea salt gula melaka - flavours were pretty good! 
The waffles are so crispy and AWESOME! Ice cream was pretty rich in flavour too. 
Walk into creamier and you will be greeted by the smell of waffles and you can\'t help but order it. Love the fluffy waffles but it could be slightly more crisp on the exterior. Though I hoped that they gave the option of just getting one rectangle, so that I can secretly sneak there and have one rectangle and one 🍦 all to myself. 2 rectangles force me to share.(🙊sometimes you just need some alone time w your sweets) Love the ice cream as well, one of my favouritest flavour there. Sweet and creamy with a slight salty note.
One of the best waffles I\'ve had. Not forgetting the banana crumble icecream. It taste so much like pure banana. #gotryittoday!
The waffles are crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside! Ice cream: thai iced tea, vanilla, chocolate 
Belgium waffles with strawberry lime sorbet and dark chocolate Ferrero ice cream
...cool, rainy evening + ice cream = best combination yet. feels like i\'m back in Dalian during the cold season, eating ice-cream with you two! @ezarizal @ynwa_sheng
it\'s my new hangout cafe. I love their homemade ice creams!!! 
Waffles with Pistachio &amp; Earl Grey Ice Cream ($8.50 + $2.50 for the extra scoop) 🍦.\n<br />🍴My go-to place when I think of good waffles &amp; ice cream. They have def mastered the crispiness &amp; flavor of their waffles. Paired with creamy &amp; well-executed ice cream (the Earl Grey is still one of my fav), Creamier always draws me back despite the cramped sitting &amp; queues ⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️.\n<br />📍@creamier_sg, Blk128 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 #01-835 S310128
One of the best ice cream in Singapore! I love pistachio! Seating was limited though. This is under HDB at Toa Payoh. One premium scoop was about $4.
Waffle was good but somehow I feel that it\'s overrated
It\'s never too late for a Post International Waffle Day at Creamier! Sea Salt Gula Melaka, Roasted Pistachio and Cookies &amp; Cream on Belgium Waffles drizzled with Chocolate and Maple Syrup ($14.30)! #rachfoodadventure #burpple  
Feels like a weekend because we\'re all hanging out together today 👫👭 #creamier
Didn\'t expect there is such a crowd in this cafe in my neighborhood.. #eventhoughidontliketoeaticecreambutthisflavorreallynotbad
Tried the waffles with thai milk tea and cookies &amp; cream, accompanied with hot chocolate and it was so good! I\'d love to come back for more!!!
3 scoops of ice cream- sea salt gula malacca, teh Tarik, Horlicks and white chocolate, with two slices of waffle~ totally melted in my mouth.. :))
Total awesome! I\'m in love with Earl grey ice cream! #sgfood #happydays
Waffles and ice-cream didn\'t disappoint. For something unique &amp; refreshing, try the Earl Grey Lavender ice-cream.
Weekend is here! Time to have some chillax time with brunch, ice cream and all the yummy food!\n<br />Love the waffles here and additional scoop of ice cream is only $2.50. Did I mentioned that the ice cream flavours are homemade?
Mild Ice Cream but awesome waffles in an ulu heartland location.
Simply the best waffle in Singapore (at least to me), I specially love their vanilla ice cream! The waffle and a scoop of ice cream cost $8.50 and I think it\'s worth the price because it\'s really delicious. The ambience is nice too, though it is not too spacious. 
There is always space for dessert. Interesting flavours with affordable price tag.. me like
I wanted to try Creamier for the longest time since i like waffles. It is indeed one of the best waffles i have ever ate! Had sea salt gula melaka ice cream and i want to try their roasted pistachio next time.
Hands down one of the best icecream and waffles in town! $12.60
Back here again with @njtlinda ! In love with their earl grey lavender ice cream! ^^
Probably the best ice cream and waffle I\'ve ever tasted. Would definitely come back for more! 
Creamier\'s long queues and licked-dry plates are testament to the truly addictive nature of their ice cream and waffles. Expect to queue even on a weeknight, but it\'s seriously worth it. Two perfectly crisp waffles stay firm below two scoops of dense ice cream. Go for the Salted Caramel Gula Melaka and the Roasted Pistachio. Photo by Geraldine Tay.
Cookies &amp; Cream // Butterscotch Almond                                               One of the very few ice-cream parlors my family and I love to visit. The belgian waffles were absolutely amazing, probably one of the best I\'ve ever eaten. Although the waffles was good, the ice-cream was comparable to other ice-cream parlors though. 
Sea salt gula malaka ice cream plus a crunchy but yet delicious waffles. I should say it is the best waffle I have ever eaten.
We all need that little sweetness in our life. Here\'s mine.
If you love Black Forest cake, you\'d love this too! There\'re chunky &amp; moist bits of cake in the ice cream and rum soaked cherries(I think). 
Sumptuous, savoury, $10. Waffle is crispy and buttery. Ice cream not too strong and complements well. Generous serving of maple and chocolate syrup.
I am officially crowning this THE BEST WAFFLE IN SINGAPORE. We topped up with a scoop of [Plain Ole Chocolate] &amp; [Sea Salt Gula Melaka]. Heavenly!! Shiokkkkkkk!! Happy-Bom-Pi-Pi!!
ice cream &amp; waffles! #sgfood too good until @reesesy didn\'t want to share!
Thick crispy waffles that weren\'t too sweet and didn\'t get soft when the ice cream melted. Yummilicious! A generous serving for $7.50. Cafe is located round a quiet corner so call to ask for directions. 
😍 sorry i can never get tired of this ever.  #throwback #sgfood
Pre-dinner heh. Must be the last person to try this.... #dessert #onthetable
It\'s ok that I could possibly b the last person to visit this small ice cream cafe at a sleepy corner in toa payoh. We prob wouldn\'t have gone there if not for the hawker center lunch we had there. It\'s a small cafe and when filled up with humans of different sizes , there leaves not much space to breath. I like to enjoy my sweet treats in a nice place where I can \"move\". So yeah thanks Creamier for this one time experience :)
Lovely fluffy crispy waffles topped with pistachio, chocolate peppermint and the unique sea salt gula melaka ice creams!
Not so impressed by the coffee and hot drinks but the ice creams could make up for it..
excellent mix of salty and sweet in the ice cream and waffles were of great texture, crispy and done just right. 
Roasted Pistachios x Rum and Raisin x Earl Grey Lavender (I would love to try ALL the flavors there)
Taking a twist to Salted Caramel, the Cream Cheese Caramel gives a light touch of sour to sweet, while the Banana and Chocolate combo never goes wrong
Crispy on the exterior and fluffy inside, these went well with the maple syrup.  While it was great to have ice-cream alongside, it is not a must-have
You are missed! Good coffee, ice cream and waffles for a sunny day!! 😁 🍴
Freshly toasted waffles topped with pistachio and chocolate icecream. One of the best waffles in town!

They have gorgeous flavors, and it really is one of the better waffle Ice cream out there.

#waffles with lavendar earl grey and raspberry rose ice cream
Awesome Belgian waffles, crispy and flavourful. May be slightly hard though, but still yummy anyway! ice cream is pretty good and dense too. Should visit this cafe If you\'re a waffle and ice cream lover like me
Always a favourite 😁 
Crisp waffles with smooth &amp; creamy sea salt gula melaka ice cream. Still my favourite waffles around.
Just can\'t get enough. 
Creamier never fails. 
luscious ice cream (double scoop of pistachio and earl grey lavender) atop 2 freshly made crispy on the outside pillowy soft on the inside waffles
if u r sick of city life, this is where you can get some spiritual peace
Waffles that is crispy on the outside, fluffy and airy in the inside. Just the way I want it to be!
love the quaint little cafe hidden in a otherwise typical neighborhood. good service too!
This place really grows on you.
Waffles ($9 with a scoop of ice cream) here are always light and fluffy, soaking up the ice cream while remaining crisp on the edges. We went with Pistachio, of course, and Orange Cranberry Smirnoff.\n<br />.\n<br />The Pistachio, is hands down the best we\'ve found around the island. Made with 100% pure pistachio nut paste, it is fragrant, nutty rich flavour with bite-able roasted pistachio nuts for the extra crunch.\n<br />.\n<br />Citrusy with a light zest, the Orange Cranberry Smirnoff is a refreshing twist with a calming sensation in every bite. The Smirnoff is not as pronounced with small hints in the ending notes, but a good balance of vodka and fresh citrus is always welcome on a hot day!\n<br />.\n<br />Heard that they\'ve recently opened another branch at Tiong Bahru. More places for an ice cream fix!\n<br />_______________\n<br />Creamier Handcrafted Ice Cream And Coffee\n<br />Blk 128 Toa Payoh Lorong 1\n<br />#01-835\n<br />Singapore 310128\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br /> #eatigosg #instafoodsg #eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #sgicecream

🍦😋 i think we tried almost all the flavours! Freshly made in house every day and it\'s really the place to go for best waffles and creamiest ice cream. So much knowledge in the difference of freshly churned and hard freezed ice cream. And do you know Creamier\'s under the same team as Sunday folks!

Love how the thick and creamy gelatos are generously complimented with pistachio and almond bits. Sinful indulgence. Will be back to try the waffles!!
😋 #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #throwback #ilovemyneighbourhood
$12.50 for waffles , pistachio ice cream and green tea ice cream. YUMZ
The chocolate is rich indeed, but I don\'t understand why must they add #alcohol to it? I think it spoilt the original flavour of the chocolate, if they want to add alcohol to chocolate, name it baileys or something, don\'t call it richest chocolate.
$3 #EarlGrey #lavender was not not bad, nice fragrance of lavender. $3 #pistachio was the best I ever had, very intense roasted nutty pistachios, better than alfero\'s! Their tahitian #vanilla was ok, needs improvement, i won\'t want to pay extra again just because the vanilla is from tahiti, it\'s a magical place i know i know, Phil Coulson may agree with me 😁 😁 😁 , still prefer alfero\'s. What I like about their ice cream is they\'re not too sweet.
Hot fluffy waffles topped with black sesame and white pistachio ice cream.
Nice waffles &amp; interesting flavor ice cream!
Overshadowed by its waffles counterpart in popularity and public awareness, this cheery cup of mocha is surprisingly rather good. Much perked up after a dose this.

something to cool down the system. a creamy scoop of my fav pistachio and the meh meh waffle.
The ice cream here was just divine. The sea salt was rich and had a nice flavour to it but the star was the pistachio which had a slight saltiness and crunch from actual pistachio nuts.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #icecream #waffles #icecreamwaffle #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #creamier #burpple

Waffles were good, even though I found them to be a bit hard. The ice cream was really, really creamy :)
Been to Creamier for a few times but first time ordering a cone. Mocchaiato is a coffee-chocolate flavour combination, with rich and smooth dark chocolate flavour kicking in first before finishing with an earthy caffeinated taste.

The waffle is crispy and very nice 👍 One of the best I\'ve ever eaten. Worth the wait and $ :) Will definitely go back!
One of the yummiest waffle with ice cream!! Freshly made waffles :) \n<br />Very small cafe, had to wait for about 15 mins before being able to settle down!
My utmost fav place for waffles. A little  disappointed with it cos the waffles is  over baked and hard. Not as fluffy as compared with the past.
Lol

Love it! But it\'s too hot outside and melts so fast. :(

I\'m sooo looking forward to this weekend ✌️
Gotta agree for Creamier to be in the top list of best waffles in Burple. Flavors of ice cream were amazing. Sea salted gula Melaka tasted like mr softee chendol (the closest ever!). Took plain ole chocolate and butterscotch almond. I love it! Pricing wise not bad, worth every penny.
Really love the ice cream and coffee there. A pity that the place is really too small...
Their ice cream was really good! As for the waffles, they were crispy but pretty much tasteless and hence did not make it into our favourite list..
The earl grey lavender taste great toooo 😘😘😘 #vsco #vscocam #vscophile #food #foodporn #desserts
Although they had about 10 or more flavours to choose from, I had a hard time picking. This particular one which had banana and nuts was really fantastic and I wouldn\'t hesitate to go back for it! The waffles was perfectttt. 
Simply irresistible.
the cafe was abit squeezy however thumbs up for their Thai Milk Tea, FTW.  
YES, it\'s creamier again. Creamier forever✌️ #foodporn
Lol, huge change from watching movies weekly to a 3 month hiatus. Anyhow, caught The Grand Budapest Hotel and I totally love it to bits 😍 Wes Anderson never fails.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
So here\'s 3 gorgeous blobs of ice-cream: Earl Grey Lavender, Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Butterscotch Almond which will hopefully bring some happiness to your Thursday 😆 #creamier
Best waffles ever eaten!

$5, good texture and consistency, just short of greatness. Also serves windowsill pies. The ice cream was awesome. Not worth unless u live nearby/have car
