I took this some time ago! Not too sure if they still serve this carrot cake... But certainly one of the best I have tasted! 
voila my super cocktail for the night. \n<br />one of the best cocktail bar in singapore and the only place in the world where you\'d be drinking in front of a mosque. that\'s singapore for you.
Smooth, thankful it wasn\'t too sweet but somehow we weren\'t impressed 
We loved this! Mushroom, cheese, bell peppers with thick slab of ham in it, quite a large portion served with toast.
Juicy thick black angus patty with jalape√±o salsa, balsamic-dressed arugula, provolone cheese, topped with a chicken chorizo between charcoal bun.
Brioche French toast drenched with salted caramel &amp; caramelised banana. Thought the sour cream on the side wasn\'t a good complement though.
31.12.2014 \\\\ Winding down the afternoon with a cup of flat white and a unique slice of cake. Grape Vitagen cake with peanut butter in the centre tastes weird at first but I guess this combination was inspired from peanut butter jelly sandwich. The cake smells very fragrant though, most probably from the Grape Vitagen.
The bluberry cheesecake was not only rich , the blueberries were simply delightful. It wasnt too sweet. It was at the right amount of creamiest.
thick brioche soaked in cinnamon and maple syrup served with fresh berries;  definitely a sweeeeet treat. and that dollop of vanilla mascarpone üëå‚ú®
Just look at that eggs benedict (looks like the egg is vomitting though) Monday Blues? I just realised I was wearing blue top and bottom!
I like the way mixologist featuring this rice-based alcohol in my cocktail, sooooooo sippable and never failed to cheer me up after my long day!
Shaved ham, melted gruyere and house-made bechamel sauce sandwich topped with a fried egg. Tasty but could benefit from more bechamel or a different sort of bread(brioche for example) to counteract the overall dryness of the dish.
Chocolate overdose - My favorite Iced Chocolate and Salted Caramel Popcorn Chocolate Cake 
Was around the area and decided to pop in here for brunch. Have heard a lot about their coffee, but since it was a hot day, I decided against a hot drink but settled for an iced mocha instead. Love the fact that they used dark chocolate and it wasn\'t too sweet. Moving on to the food, I pretty much liked their rendition of eggs Benedict with chorizo and avocado on soft fluffy toasted brioche. Though I found the watermelon balls refreshing, I have to say that they didn\'t really complement well with the rest of the dish. All in all, would definitely come back to try their signature coffee and other breakfast items. üòä
There was such a long queue at thid place! Couldn\'t bear to eat such a pretty sweet thing!
Comfort food! Love the combination of scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and toasted whole grain bread. And the guacamole side was surprisingly yummy 
Aptly served in this bottle as it definitely was medicine for a tired soul. A distillate from 18 hours of cold drip, it was refreshing, interestingly sweet and layered with flavors. Wish it had more body though... 
This place not only serves one of the best coffees, it also has a great brunch and dessert menu. Tip: if you come often enough, you will benefit from their loyalty card. Get 1 stamp with every cup or coffee. Complete 7 stamps to earn 1 cup free. 
Wholesome breakfast packed with everything you need to kick start your day. Order this only if you have a voracious appetite. 
Butter creamy inside with the mixed pepper and ham. Big portion but the more layers of flavor were needed. \n<br />Maybe their coffee could helped me to get out of the hangover. \n<br />Maison Ikkoku\n<br />20 Kandahar Street,\n<br />Singapore 198885\n<br />Phone:6294 0078\n<br />Mon - Thu: 9am - 9pm\n<br />Fri &amp; Sat: 9am - 11pm\n<br />Sun: 9am - 7pm
Pure comfort food! Thick toasts clothed with egg and pan fried. Flooded with caramel sauce and topped with walnut and banana. \n<br />I love the texture of the French toasts.

A good corner to have a quiet breakfast. \n<br />The egg Benedict was good but lack of something special. Next time I will try their coffee, maybe it is better.
Other than one or two ingredients were different, their dishes actually repeat itself. \n<br />Honestly speaking they could consider changing their night chef, the wedges were stale and the rest was even warm. Such a simple dish like big breakfast could taste like this....
Maison Ikkoku is set in the heart of Kampong Glam, where in recent years, many shophouses have been restored to their former glory. This cafe is staffed with Sawada-trained baristas - Hiroshi Sawada being a Japanese celebrity barista, and serves up some of the best specialty coffee around. Get your dose of great coffee, including various single origin coffees brewed on Chemex at Cafe Fest!
Good cream cheese to cake ratio! I heard they have other renditions of their rainbow cakes right now!
so dense and moist.. definitely my pick anytime of the day!
Coffee is richly flavoured, not so impressed by service. Now I know why üòï
I use to enjoy coming here but after experiencing particularly bad service today, I\'d think twice about ever returning.\n<br />Seriously, what\'s with the \"I-couldn\'t-care-less\" attitude, zero eye contact and the extremely rude tone?!! Yo young lady, if you aren\'t happy responding to customers, please do not choose to be in the service line.\n<br />The encounter today has sadly altered my positive impression of Maison Ikkoku. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and it wasn\'t because of the food.
Sparks fly when fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese meets the right dressing. I was very pleased to experience this at Maison Ikkoku. Their cheerily sweet balsamic vinegar dressing is tweaked in-house till it hits perfect pitch with the soft milky creaminess of the cheese (a senior member of the team there told me that lots of taste tests were done to ensure this). I can\'t think of a better accompaniment than the chorus of mixed leaf salad and tomatoes that came together on the plate. For sure, this is a pleasing dish both to the eye, and the palette.
A smart cafe understands the power of having well-curated reading material. When it provides a variety of quality magazines, like Maison Ikkoku does, that in itself is already an attraction for me. There is an unexplainable pleasure in perusing pages of stylishly written and designed content as I slowly sip from my cup. 
I very much preferred this latte made with today\'s house blend over the other one that was available (the Costa Rica Zamonara). 
Break of Dawn (basically it\'s big breakfast) and Signature Eggs Benedict. Also Chemex and Latte. Nothing that I particularly liked and there\'s nothing to picked on as well so I guess that\'s pretty good. üòÇüòÇ I\'m a bad food reviewer lol
Pros:\n<br />- Delicious food\n<br />- Robust coffee, comforting hot chocolate\n<br />- Weekend brunch menu = üòç
You basically tell the staff what you feel for the night and bam! Surprise cocktail! No menu at this cocktail bar. Cosy little bar :) 
Brilliant coffee. Worth the walk here.
Despite all the charming little caf√©s popping up in the area, this tiny place is always packed to the brim on weekends. We put our name down on the waiting list, and explored around the neighbourhood for 45 mins. before we got a teeny weeny seat by a corner. Their all-day-breakfasts are better than their cakes.
These tasted a little cheaper than its cost. The chocolate rice on top of the chocolate cake is really not ok for me. Smores Pie was best out of these three as I like the salty taste that breaks the sweetness of the choc.
22sgd, egg Benedict with prosecco ham. Salty ham, can use normal ham
Great for coffee and cake, or brunch if you\'re up early enough. Try going to Maison at night if you usually go in the day, it\'s cosy and perfect for catching up with old friends over a cup of cold drip coffee.
Huge piece of rainbow cake that makes your day; not too sweet and goes well their artisan coffee
Thought its going to be very sweet as it is heavily drenched with caramel syrup but its just nice! Yums!
For $10 a slice, this is worth a try....... for two! \n<br />Yes! A full 7-layer cake with different colours not to be missed!
Huge slice of smores pie that has a layer of marshmallows on the top layer, cookie crumble in the middle and chocolate as the base.
Had a slice of Smores pie and 7- layer rainbow cake. The cake can be shared with 2 people cuz its really a huge slice. 7 layers,  with 7 different flavours.\n<br />Not to be missed!!!!
Maison Ikkoku is set in the heart of Kampong Glam, where in recent years, many shophouses have been restored to their former glory. This gorgeous, cosy cafe is set in the ground floor of a shophouse facing the mosque, and serves up some of the best specialty coffee around. Head upstairs to the third floor if you\'re in the mood for some cocktails.
I think it was a Boston Cake Pie that we shared, a cappucino for him and mocha for me. I really can\'t remember tbh, pretty pricey but not too bad!
French toast with caramelised banana! Damm good i swear but must share
Coffee here is great. Cakes on the other hand is not complementing. This rainbow cake is way too sweet and the sponge is course. We also tried the chocolate caramel, it was dry and course. Disappointing. 
This would have been perfect to start another humdrum week. #brunch #sgigfoodies #foodporn
Nice fix
The French toast at Maison Ikkoku is served either with fresh berries, or sea salt caramel. Two large pieces of toast drenched generously with sea salt caramel, topped with roasted walnuts, caramelised bananas and mascarpone cream cheese with a cinnamon-coated orange. If you like sweet desserts, this will be perfect for sharing! Photo by C G.
This omelette is one of the few variations that Maison Ikkoku has on their breakfast menu. It was well done with an enticingly liquid middle oozing with rich, melting cheese and slices of ham. The two thick pieces of sourdough toast and a tartly-dressed mixed green salad were nice complements, making this the kind of filling breakfast that would lead you to skip lunch.
Childhood fantasy cake! The \"paddle pop\" flavour is more in the icing though... But if you\'re feeling nostalgic, $8 is not too huge a price to pay to take a trip back in time.
I love their coffee blends and very helpful barista to recommend the coffee that suits your taste
Cuppacino, Banana Republic, Strawberry Shortcake and Tiramisu-in-a-jar.... My vote for the night: Banana Republic. Coffee is gooooooood too
Love the atmosphere. Prices are ranged from $7 to $8 for their desserts. Worth trying :-) 
Post-work out coffee.  Dedicated to my 696 SIR camp mates :)
Rendang Benedict is one of the best. Love the coffee there 
what pretty rose folds &amp; such delicate work. looking at it makes me happy already! 
Creamy eggs with salty smoked salmon on bread, best eaten for brunch!
We were spoilt with cakes at Maison Ikkoku! üòä The blueberry cheesecake is light and refreshing, whilst the Salted Caramel is heavier, but yet not too sweet. Best part was the salted caramel layer on the top (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë) 
Cake in a jar, ROCHER CRUNCH. The Backwards of S.T.R.E.S.S.E.D. Need I say more?
Loves Indie Cafe... Get drown in the trippy music. Iced Mocha//Costa Rica Cold Brew//Rocher Crunch in Jar. Enjoy the weekends guys! *kokoko* lol.
Love the cookie dough but the vanilla icing is very sweet... 
A really large portion that can be shared by two. Love the potato wedges and sausages
Dough or don\'t and rose red velvet
Sweet, with overwhelming mint flavor. Definitely a refreshing cocktail for a lazy evening

Really rich and moist cake. Can be very sinful. Better share with friend.
Amazing coffee! Best if you come with your loved ones :D
Super huge slice of sponge cake with layers of cream... A meal in itself or for sharing. Not a very strong mango taste and sweetness is just nice. MI Signature  Latte (double shot in a 10.oz cup) is a nice strong hit of coffee with awesome latte art!
This Rainbow Cake definitely cannot be eaten alone! It needs to be shared!!
Review of Maison Ikkoku up at www.ms-skinnyfat.com #sgfood #sgfoodreviews
Sweet surprise for breakfast. It\'s Friday and I finally reached the end of this week! Yayness to the maximum! Good bye soon!
Frangelico with Mozart chocolate liquer. This frappe stands out and is a definite head turner in my favorite mixology bar. If you\'re looking for a cocktail in place of a dessert, have this. You won\'t regret it.
Triple Ham Sandwich that I waited half an hour for. S$16 - Parma, honey baked ham, turkey ham, melted Swiss cheese, mixed bell pepper relish served with salad and almond.
One of great eggs benedict i\'ve ever taste. Tangy hollandaise sauce with runny eggs, piece of english muffin, and prosciutto to energize your day. A must try. 
Yummy! not too sweet~
The works for brunch! FTW!!! #burpple
I never take banana. But in this amazing concoction, it tastes pretty fantastic. Not to mention the splendid display of cocktails. This is one of my favorite bars. 
Rimmed with cinnamon, this martini is potent but yet tasty. I seldom find cocktails that don\'t taste like they\'re not well balanced. I think a good cocktail should taste good and not just thick and heavy with vodka, but it also has to be strong on the same hand. This apple martini uses really fresh ingredients. Floating on top of the foam, which tastes so good, is a ring of an apple. Stunning and simple!
Thinking of what to eat for brunch tomorrow? How about eggs benny? üç≥
Being a coffee ambassador to my new Canadian colleague.  Last stop for the day - Maison Ikkoku
Tiramisu from Maison Ikkoku Cafe. Can\'t seem to geotag it. The pattern is reminiscent of #burpple logo :)
Don\'t have to tell what cake this is, as that\'s too obvious! Jennifer\'s pick of her dessert at Maison Ikkoku, but ended up I finished the entire slice for her! üòÅ
Red Velvet cake from Maison Ikkoku cafe! üç∞ Was  good not too sweet, but I still prefer FBB version of red velvet! Cos\' of the chocolate! üòã
Latte art on hot chocolate @alainlicious
Last stop! Carrot cake (can\'t resist the little carrot on top) and red velvet cake. Love the carrot cake, not too many walnuts which is good for me. The red velvet has a distinctive chocolate taste. Can\'t stand the flies though :(
Preferred the salmon version t the parma ham\'s cos the parma ham was a lil too thin. The smoked salmon one was a better combi, and i really liked how their egg bens are slightly diff from the rest cos they added pepper or some spices which added a lil more flavour apart from the sauce. 
Very flavourful yet doesnt taste overly bitter. 
I like how they mix furikake seasoning w the rice and wrapped it like a sushi, and it goes well w coffee (surprisingly) as suggested. 
Ok, that\'s all.
Oh wait... busy weekend ahead üòî\n<br />üçπüçπ Cheers tho!

Didn\'t know that they serve dinner menu too. This is King Prawn Udon ($18) in French lobster broth, served with Hokkaido scallop, wasabi roe and black roe. The flavoring that went in there was incredible. The thin flat udon absorbed all the goodness of the bisque-like broth. I also liked the hint of spiciness in this dish.

$18 for half a dozen. Yummy touch of caramelized onions and lots of cheese. 
Grape Vitagen cake with peanut butter in the centre tastes weird at first but I guess this combination was inspired from peanut butter jelly sandwich. The cake smells very fragrant though, most probably from the Grape Vitagen.

This is by far, the best red velvet cake I\'ve ever tasted! The cake is moist, fragrant and goes extremely well with the cream cheese that\'s is not too sweet yet so creamy and smooth. Got to know its from this baker @fathiscakes and I\'m so gonna sign up for her upcoming baking class. :) #sgigfoodies #sgcafe #sgbaker #yummy #cake
