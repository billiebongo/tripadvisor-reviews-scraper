A big spoon for you, open your mouth please! This dish had a grand smokey entrance with the nitrogen smoke (very IG-worthy moment) and had us swooning from the very first bite. Imagine a modern remake of our local classic dessert. Pineapple granita with coconut ice cream, topped with chendol green bits and coconut foam should be eaten in a single mouthful to best appreciate the mix of flavours. ($16)
And you thought Kinder Bueno could not be reinvented? This dish will send you to chocolate heaven.. Minus the chocolate sponge. The bitter chocolate sherbet, the Bailey\'s hazelnut cream &amp; creamy milk chocolate all hit the right sweet spots! This was like flying business class in Kinder Bueno airlines! They should rethink the sponge though. Only makes one want to poke it to test it\'s spongeiness! 😁 ($16)
Parrot fish... achar..Sounds like nasi lemak fish according to my friend. Eaten when freshly served, this parrot fish was sweet but had a spicy garlic chili butter to awaken those sleepy taste buds! Let your taste buds sizzle down with the fresh cucumber achar before going back for another bite of the fish. Best eaten while hot.. if not it gets a bit fishy!
I\'ve heard of duck fat potatoes. So when lamb fat potatoes was on the menu, how could I resist ordering? Lamb fat, leh!! Would it be ewww or wow? Only the potatoes were wow! Crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. The lamb fat left a unique aftertaste which was hard to describe in words..But made me reach out for a second piece while thinking about describing it! So that says it! Totally worth the carbs!!
This was the night\'s most disappointing dish as the sauce was not able to complement the dish to the next level. While the ribs were cooked till tender, it really wasn\'t the waste of calories.
This was their special of the day which lived us to to its name. The fragrant Thai spices had us remember the taste of Tom Yum Soup without too spicy a kick. This allowed us to savour the plump freshness of the little neck clams. Definitely worth the stomach space to try!
Two of my favourite items from the brunch menu:\n<br />Firstly, the meatless but oh soooo flavourful curried omelette with scarmoza (smoked mozzarella!! ❤) on a homemade ciabatta with sriracha and mayo, plus a cucumber and pineapple raita for a much needed tangy contrast.
One of my favorite dish of the night. The meat has the right amount fat and is slowly cooked making it very tender. The sweet and soy-like sauce really makes you go back for more.
The curried cauliflower was crisp and light, while the madras curry yoghurt really brought out the best flavors. A must order dish!
Cider never taste this refreshing, and it\'s rare to find ciders in this flavour (usually it\'s the boring Apple cider or pear ciders). Brunch with a good bottle of apple, black currants and cranberry cider, makes anyone a happy person.
Cooked nicely pink. Nicely seasoned, accompanied with a really good baked potato!
The tender fried chicken and fluffy pancakes delivered with FedEx levels of competence, but the headliner here is indisputably the chye poh-esque chilli, which presents a riotous carnival of flavours - from sweet and seedy spicy to saliva-teasingly tangy - that will run the real risk of you having insufficient chilli for the titular items due to you being so stalkerishly addicted to that wicked nectar. 3.9/5\n<br />⠀⠀\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Fat Lulu\'s.
Every component was bold, intense, and literally fights for your attention. Crisp fried chicken, well-seasoned and super tasty; chilli sauce that’s tangy, spicy, and sweet at once; and an apple coleslaw that’s crunchy, creamy, and aggressively sweetened. It’s an absolute fireworks of flavours and textures, or a war zone depending on how you see it, and it’s unabashedly my favourite dish from their brunch menu.\n<br />.\n<br />New post up on the blog after months of silence! Head over to read more on my experience at Fat Lulu\'s 😉 http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/single-post/2016/11/04/Fat-Lulu%E2%80%99s-Redefining-brunch
The Burnt Corn is rubbed with salt and lemon, oregano, served with sour cream. 
Pineapple granita at the bottom layer that has a nice balance - sweet and slightly sour. Then there are the dehydrated coconut foam chunks that crumble as you eat it is placed all around. Nata de coco pieces here and there, to give it a nice chewy texture. Green worms - chendol so that as you sniffed too much of the fancy \'smoke\', your \'own chendol\' might drop in the bowl and still looked like it belong there, just joking!! A beautiful quenelle of delicious coconut ice cream! The desserts in this place all look so beautiful and taste good!
Chef blends Chipotle, Kechap Manis, Rice Wine Vinegar giving it an Asian-Mexican twist to it. Chef was in US and had experience and loved Mexican cuisine. He was consulting Chef for the opening of Naughty Nuri in Singapore and so this ribs has a story too. Whole rack for only $28. Eating this alone, one will never see my ribs. I have my own marbling just like Fat Lulu. 😊
It\'s called Spicy Iberico Pork Sataytay. $12 for 5 big skewers. They didn\'t burn this. It\'s slowly BBQ-ed. Let the ingredients and the Asian style marination tempt you to order more.
Not burning for the sake of it. Their purpose of burning is to produce the nice caramelization kind of burnt. Chef is an alumnus of the @theculinaryinstituteofamerica and have experimented with what can and cannot be nicely caramelised for their improved menu. This Burnt Corn is good! I got to come back here with the Mrs who loves corn. Sweet corn burnt then rubbed with lemon and salt to remove some of the charred bits. The taste of lemon, salt on sweetish and still juicy corn kernels with the smell of charness is quite addictive.
Loving all the dishes!! This messy comforting lamb meatballs is 😍😍😍 More on stories!
Firm, juicy, moist and perfectly shaped lamb meatballs, tossed in a savoury tomato sauce, with dollops of mashed fava beans that taste deceptively like guacamole, lashings of tangy yogurt, shredded basil leaves, crushed papadum, a hidden sous vide egg, and buttered toasted homemade bread. It\'s warm, it\'s comforting, it\'s so so hearty and utterly delish. Wiped the plate off entirely on my own!
Just look at that thick, meaty piece of bacon, glazed with maple syrup, and sporting the sexiest crosshatch marks. Complete with a creamy scramble, well-toasted slices of bread spread with garlic sour cream, and sweet cherry tomatoes — hands down the best bacon &amp; eggs brekkie I\'ve ever had.
What can I say? Fat Lulu\'s really captured my childhood in this one! Concept behind this dessert revolves around the dropped peanut pop.😰 Of course in a child\'s head, a dropped ice cream is like... on the same level as the end of the world, thus the cassis granita \'blood\' spurting out of it.🔪🍦 RIP peanut pop... 😭
Man, if you\'re looking for a satisfying brunch, then THIS IS IT! 😂 I\'ve been to Fat Lulu\'s for their desserts previously and I\'m happy to say their food is equally as quirky and tasty as their desserts.
Love it!!! Not only does it look pretty, I could not stop digging into the different textures! Will be back!
With pesto olive oil and gulamelaka dressing, melt in your mouth creamy burrata and super sweet tomatoes! I could eat this on my on and move on to desserts!!!
Back to this place for dinner, but what stunned me the most was still their plated dessert. This was as a delightful refreshing note to end our meal. It was definitely a pleasure to the eyes, with contrasting shades of pink, red and white. My favourite element was the cassis granita whose texture was not too icy — proving my expectation wrong. Instead it was rather chewy and smooth with strong blackcurrant taste. Another element worth the shout-out was the elderflower-infused strawberries, giving a rather unique combination of sweet and sour.
On their seasonal menu...\n<br />🍴Berries &amp; White Chocolate [S$16++ before 10pm] White chocolate ice cream, cassis granita, frozen cassis foam, elderflower infused strawberries. ⭐️Rating : 🌝🌝🌝\n<br />📍Fat Lulu\'s \n<br />River Valley Conservation Area, 297 River Valley Road\n<br />🇸🇬Singapore 238338\n<br />🚗Parking at the back alley [Free]\n<br />⏰Opening Hours :\n<br />Tue - Thu: 18:00 - 23:00\n<br />Fri - Sat: 18:00 - 02:00\n<br />Sun: 18:00 - 23:00\n<br />Closed on Monday
Essentially Magnum\'s loving tribute to Smucker\'s Goober Stripes (y\'know, that peanut butter mixed with jam you probably ate before at some point), with the now ubiquitous popping candy adding some excitement and the refreshingly tart granita sure to bring vampires and tampons to the mental yard. 3.9/5
The most razzle-dazzle of the desserts we had in terms of presentation, this ended up being the least tastebuddingly remarkable. (The best dessert had a visual element reminiscent of something which comes out of a woman\'s mi....never mind.) Their plated desserts are $10 each (usual price: $14 - $16) after 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays this month.
At Fat Lulu\'s, dessert shouldn\'t be an afterthought, it should be a priority.
Some people would be averse to beef tongue even without trying it. At Fat Lulu\'s, it\'s a great place to pop your beef tongue cherry!
After a two month hiatus, the now-defunct Five and Dime Eatery along River Valley Road has rebranded and opened its doors, this time as Fat Lulu\'s. With Raven\'s ex-head chef Sam Chablani helming the kitchen, the restaurant now serves modern Asian barbecues and an incredibly affordable dessert set menu. Come with foodie friends to try new, innovative dishes and get comfy in the cosy atmosphere. Whet your appetite with the signature Nori Crusted Salmon ($17), raw salmon sashimi wrapped with nori seaweed and generously topped with ponzu sago. There are only four mains on the menu, of which you must go for the Duh Meat Board ($28) — a trio of skirt steak, smoked kailan and the irresistibly yummy sambal pork chop. Don\'t leave without having Fat Lulu\'s three-course Dessert Tasting ($35) — the sweets, which see the likes of Chai Tea Creme Brulee and \"Atas\" Kinder Bueno are both picture perfect and tasty!\n<br />Avg price: $40 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Irene Arieputri
Mango &amp; Lychee, as simple as it sounds, came neat yet aesthetically pleasing. The best way to enjoy this is to break the popiah-like pastry \"shell\" to let the thick mango cream meet the lychee granita, and devour the 3 different components together. I thought mango and lychee would clash in flavours but my doubt was proven wrong. This is definitely the champion of the 3 desserts we tried because it\'s just so refreshing and addictive.
The captivating dry-ice effect slowly faded to reveal the beauty of a forest: The Black Forest. This is a very creative way of presenting a deconstructed black forest dessert, especially as it comes with a small little mushroom in the middle of eerie \"forest\", which evoked a harmonious \"aww\" from both of us. The alcoholic cherries were potent enough to wake you up from the fairy tale image while in my opinion, the chocolate ice cream could have been stronger to balance out the lightly flavoured chantilly.
Contrary to the menu, the Sambal Pork wasn\'t spicy as all but pleasantly sweet char siew like that was meat-fat-meat.  Really delightful with a good bite. The Kailan was another good surprise for me, served slightly burnt and cooked to perfection. The veg emits a good smoky flavour with a crunchy texture. I will happily eat a plate of this myself 😻
Probably the best dish for the night for me (especially cause I\'m the biggest corn freak you will ever know 😜) These beautiful slices are one of the sweetest I\'ve tasted (specially sourced) that you jolly well eat it by itself. Slightly burning them brings about that aromatic smokiness 😌, paired with smoked sour cream &amp; lemon which I feel was on the sour side. \n<br />Overall, a really good dinning experience over at @sgfatlulus who has taken over the now defunct Five &amp; Dime along River Valley Road.
This is the final course called \"Mango and Lychee\". The popiah-looking thing that you see perched on top is actually mango cream encased in a crispy shell. The rice-looking thing below is actually lychee granita, which is shaved ice.\n<br />🔸\n<br />It\'s interesting to think of this as the dessert (since it\'s the final course) of the desserts. And indeed we all agree this humble looking thing is the best out of the three desserts we tried. To eat this, first crush the mango popiah and mix that with the bed of lychee granita, and there you get your fruity mix of cream, ice and crisp. The granita makes this a very refreshing dessert, I scooped every bit of melted lychee ice towards the end.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Three pretty and intricate desserts as good as what you get during fine dining at a great price. I will definitely go back to try another set of 3 other desserts with my wife.
This is the second course, \"The Black Forest\".\n<br />🔸\n<br />They asked if we would like to walk over and watch them do the plating, and indeed it\'s a spectacle with a dry ice finale. No wonder all the bar counter seats were taken up when we arrived.\n<br />🔸\n<br />It\'s served on chocolate mud and came with kirsch cherries and chocolate ice cream. Smooth chocolate, not too sweet, nice play of textures, but I love the kirsch cherries the most - fruity with a little excitement from alcohol.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The frozen chantilly made it look like black forest covered in snow. And spot the little mushroom 🍄
Recently opened only three days ago, this was the recommended dessert from @sgfatlulus manager, Bobby. Oh man... It was love at first bite ❤️👅❤️ Mango cream piped into this crisp roll and laid on a bed of lychee granita, it was the best way to end the night with a burst of refreshment! Next time, I want a whole plate to myself #notsharingwithanyone 🙊
This was the first course we got at @sgfatlulus - milk chocolate, coffee cream and cocoa crumble centered by the choux pastry. It pretty much tasted like how it sounds - sweet, hits of choc, crunchy bits and a good choux pastry. 👌
As part of Fat Lulu’s Desserts Pig Out ($65++), the restaurant has meticulously selected 10 mini plated desserts to be shared between 4 pax. Every plate is so beautifully plated and comes with different flavour profiles that it’s hard to choose one as the favourite. For fans that love their desserts with a sour note, there’s the Mini Childhood and Lemon Grass Jelly, while those that prefer a richer flavour will prefer the Green Tea Opera and Mocha Choux (pictured), with the latter a choux puff filled with coffee cream, topped with a milk chocolate crisp with cocoa crumbles by the side. So what are you waiting for? Grab a few of your friends and head over to Fat Lulu for a dessert pig out session!\n<br />_________________\n<br />Fat Lulu’s\n<br />Address: 297, River Valley Road, Singapore 238338\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #sgfatlulus #nodessertsnokiss
Desserts: Berries and White Chocolate ($16), \"Childhood\" ($16). 🍫My friends know how to spoil me 😛 Thank you for the birthday treat and presents @ronaldisthewan and @beaverwoo ❤ #burpple
My love from childhood visited me in a more atas remake! Peanut butter ice cteam coated with chocolate, served with raspberry puree! Who knew these two could pair so well? Definitely not your Magnum-level PB ice cream. This is like one of the best PB ice creams I\'ve had in Singapore! Fans of PB will enjoy this! ($16)
This is accompanied with honshimeiji mushrooms, kale and garlic. Another delightful item on the menu is the Sataytay ($12) which uses Iberico pork collar that is marinated in sambal for a whole full day to develop the flavour. On top of the flavoursome meat, it was tender and juicy too.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #potato #satay
The moist banana bread together with the brandy butterscotch sauce is not overly sweet and well balance.

Chef over caramalized the apples for his traditional apple pie and to save it, he laid a layer of pastry over the apples, baking it as an upside down tart. Likewise, he also created a new flavour when he burned the base of the vanilla ice cream.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgfatlulus

The fruity dessert uses white chocolate and cassis, with elderflower-infused strawberries.

The wagyu skirt is grilled in low heat to get that slow caramelisation while retaining the succulence of the meat. On the other hand, the pork collar which is marinated in sambal and seasoned in salt, is grilled in high heat for the charred and smokiness. Even the accompanying kailan grilled for a different appreciation of the earthy green.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #sgfatlulus #beef #noburnnotaste
The brown kecap manis sauce which is the indonesian soy sauce will bring joy to your palate with its thick and syrupy consistency.\n<br />Squeeze the lime and its zestiness adds yet another dimension to the already multifaceted flavor of the dish.
Back then I mentioned that the flavours and textures were on the note. However like a foreign song, I moved with the music but did not understand the lyrics. This time round, Chef Sam managed to sing to me in the dish and I could fully appreciate the whole concept and execution.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #sgfatlulus #ravioli

The line caught parrot fish is marinated with chilli, garlic, lemon juice, Kashmiri chilli powder and grilled in high heat. The result is a moist fish with the beautiful aroma that is pleasing to both the taste and scent. The cucumber achar side provided the needed acidity to freshen up the palate.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #sgfatlulus #fish #achar

The bio-corn is rubbed with salt and lemon, oregano and served with sour cream. Aligned with Chef Sam\'s culinary philosophy - No Burn No Taste, the overly charred corn turned out to be very flavourful.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #noburnnotaste #corn #sgfatlulus
The spicy sauce which made up of chipotle, kechap manis, rice wine vinegar is kind of unique. It is a new taste to me and took a while to register my preference, in a good way.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #porkribs #noburnotaste
The pork collar is only seasoned with salt and grilled to a nice smokey scent, The other highlight on the board is the lightly charred sambal okra. The used of local spices to grill the okra reminds me of our sambal bbq fish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #porkcollar

Peanut butter popsicle, dark chocolate cookie and raspberry granita. The was trying to plate it, accidentally dropped the ingredients and came out beautiful. 😂😂😂

If only I can jump straight to the next weekend and get my hands on @SGFatLulus simply delish \'Childhood\' - a dessert of chocolate, peanut butter and bright cassis notes. #CountdownToTheWeekend
Of course, It\'s the freaking weekends!
weekends better get a move on!

The choux pastry was first filled with rich coffee cream, then topped with a milk chocolate disc, more cream (😋), and finally sprinkled with generous amounts of cocoa crumble and edible flowers 🌸👌🏼! If you need more flowers to beautify this for your insta shot, just ask! (At least that\'s what @msginginly did 😂). 🍴
This was the best of the three. Mango cream in the rolled up crispy pastry shell sleeping on an icy bed of lychee granita. This final one actually helped to tone down the slight heaviness of the first 2 courses. My favorite was the granita cos well it was cold, light, citrussy and a palate cleanser.
Presenting the Black Forest. Deconstructed to portray the forest. A dollop of chocolate ice cream resting on chocolate \"soil\" and flanked by kirsch cherries. The mushroom is made of meringue...my favorite cos it was so cutesy. The white chantilly that was snow-like was prepared using liquid nitrogen.\n<br />💨💨\n<br />It was a dramatic finish to the plating. Tastewise, I liked the ice cream and the chocolate soil. But I wished it had a bit more \"wow\" factor. As for the cherries, it pains me (same time happy) to see the boys @that_dex @coolheart @i_post_for_love enjoying them tremendously cos the cherries were soaked in alcohol and I cant take alcohol😢. Sad lor😔\n<br />💨💨\n<br />The third and final dessert will be posted soon and I know this will not disappoint.

Took over where Five &amp; Dime was. \n<br />A mocha choux puff was 1st of a 3 course dessert. Filled with coffee cream which was a tad sweet but one can taste the coffee flavor. A round thin chocolate disc was placed on top with choco cream being piped onto it. Cocoa crumbs and edible flowers were then sprinkled generously. 🌹🌻\n<br />To me, this was nice but it did not wow me. But wait..this is the first of three tasting desserts. The choux puff is slightly bigger than usual so this can be shared. For the other 2, I will be posting it real soon. This 3 course degustation dessert cost $35++. And who knows, it might just get better 😄\n<br />Oh...Fatlulu is opened only from 6pm onwards. Located at 297 River Valley Road. For those who drive, fret not, a private carpark just for Fatlulu\'s diners is located behind the cafe.\n<br />#desserts #dessertlovers #cafesg #cafehopping #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #burpplesg #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #narratrs #tripadvisor #citynomadssg #fatlulus_sg
