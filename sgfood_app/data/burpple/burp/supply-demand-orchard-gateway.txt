Pretty, but the intense flavour of garlic overwhelms the delicate flavour of the tender pumpkin. At least the rice is properly al-dente.
One of the best creamy pastas I\'ve had is the carbonara cremoso (extra creamy). I love it when it\'s not too watery nor too thick. And you can choose either normal or tasting portion which I personally think tasting portion is ok if you\'re not too hungry and if you are sharing other sides. Tasting portion is $13++ and normal will be $17++. Personally I think truffle fries should only be shoestring fries as those tend to have stronger truffle flavor. 
Simply amazing! Named the hangover pizza, that\'s more than what you can expect after a night of crazy drinking I think many would not mind greeted by this in the morning. Cheers!
In simple words; squid ink risotto with plentiful seafood! Finely chopped onions within the risotto adds a good flavour to the dish! Fans of risotto and squid ink should definitely give this dish a chance! Would reccommend this dish to share as its flavour is quite rich for a one-person-meal.
Back at supply and demand again. Food here is rly good. This squid ink risotto, $28++, was rly amazing. It\'s very fragrant and flavourful and packed with so much seafood! Would definitely definitely get this again. Must try everyone! Ten thumbs up👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
.... vodka pasta ($24++ full) . Not your ordinary tomato base. Pardon me for forgetting the name of this dish. Hope they can be more generous on the smoked salmon. 3 pcs for this price tag is abit stingy. -M
BFF Birthdays feast at supply &amp; demand !food are good for sharing as the portion are quite big ,good for those group gathering .overall rating :3.5/5 
Cheese infused cream sauce with wild mushrooms and bacon. ($19++) got the full portion instead of the tasting portion ($14++). Not sure how small the tasting potion is but might get that next time and order more sides. Everything was really good except I feel that the mushrooms didn\'t have enough mushrooms taste? I\'ll give it 4.5/5! Service was pretty good too (:
The whole restaurant smells so good with many tables ordering garlic truffles fries! Gets crowded around 7 so remember to come early! Pizza was thin and good! The truffle flavored pizza is quite nice... Aglio olio is very flavorful! A tad expensive though..
There are a variety of tea selections offered here and gives off a nice scent while sipping.
Look (drool) no further, soldier. Yes, those awesome golden creamy cheddar cheese fries are filing up your mess tin. Never in a gazillion years would the cook house be whipping up such  delectable snacks or meal! I looked stunned like vegetables. Don\'t tell me, this is only half the portion, as I recall the mess tin comes with 2 halves. \"Yes\", I heard a gentle voice reply, \"you can dig in now, sir. It doesn\'t come with the other side\".
Featuring Truffle and Egg Pizza (9-inch at $20) - a combination of heavenly truffle and soft eggporn smacked right in the middle of the pizza. Black truffle paste was spread evenly across the tomato base pizza, topped with Mozzarella and Rucola Leaves. Truffle paste was strong and the Rucola Leaves added the crunch to the texture.\n<br />Check out the link in my profile and the giveaway will end on 2359, 20 Mar 16! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
Legend says this tangy, sweet savoury, slightly salty dish was invented by a nightclub owner from Campania, Italy. \n<br />Just as he was closing, a group of hungry streetwalkers demanded he make them \"any kind of garbage\", so he threw together this dish. \n<br />This rustic dish has a thick, semi-dry sauce that is incredibly fresh, so addictive!
A deconstructed version (it\'s supposed to be a casserole), I like the savoury salty ham and juicy grilled tomato with a hint of smokiness. \n<br />The potatoes baked with cream is rich and warm... decent comfort brunch!
Properly rich and creamy, with an intense espresso soaked savoiardi, this decadent dessert boasts 2 kinds of liqueur!
Home made bread (I call it baby baguette) slathered with butter and sweet onion marmalade, decked with brie, raclette, gruyere, mozerella cheese. Served with scrambled egg, greens and sliced ham (or sausage). Really interesting as a bite or brunch!
The delicious polenta cake is stuffed with summer vegetables, and the parma ham lends some savoury saltiness. Find myself wishing there was more polenta cake!
The best combination of a pizza. Chunks of meat, thin crust with runny eggs. Highly recommended
Tasty and fresh white wine broth. Best seafood pasta I have ever tasted
$17++ thick cut fries with truffle oil and Parmesan shavings. One of the best I have tried. Not oily at all
I love the Arrabbiata sauce! Spicy, tangy and slightly sweet! My biggest fear of ordering a prawn dish is that the prawns are frozen and it\'s all mushy inside. Was glad that the prawns are large, crunchy and juicy! 
Lovin how crispy and how delicious the pizza is! Did I mention how much I love that egg in the middle? Partially is because I love half cooked egg! 😛 I\'ve seen many good reviews abt this pizza and this is my 2nd time having it! Definitely headin back to try out their other dishes too! 😝
Carbonara Classico (no cream) vs Cremerio (with cream). Usually I prefer the former, but most restaurants here serve with cream. S&amp;D\'s rendition is rich but not overly creamy and wet. Perhaps, it\'s the penne that absorbs the cream better.
Risotto rice balls fried to perfection. Requested for additional chopped chili padi in the dipping Arrabiatta sauce.
Throwback to last weekend\'s lunch date when we ate ourselves silly with this huge ass portion of hearty, meaty pasta. 
You can say that again!
The pasta that looks deceivingly simple but taste so divine. Let the mascarpone cheese melt into your pasta and give it a light mix, then just slurp the whole thing down. The tomato sauce is tasty with the flavours of garlic and basil, while the melted mascarpone goes very well with the tomato sauce. The tasting size is less than half of the full. A little too little for me but just nice when you eat it with cichetis. 
Garlic truffle fries, calm spaghetti with white wine sauce is ♥️ and carbonara. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Tomato base crispy thin crust pizza topped with breakfast ingredients; Mushroom, Bacon and Soft eggs. #eatwithzac
Looks and smells good but taste is average. For such pasta, it\'s too soupy. Not very satisfy but can still be a pass.
This pasta really brought local flavour to a whole new level. Spicy sambal marinara sauce with al dente spaghetti. I must say it was done quite well. Only gripe was that I ate something crunchy, like shell or sand? Though that didn\'t spoil the experience too much.
the morning after pizza was really good! so was the truffle garlic fries, where literally half a clove of garlic was served along the fries! the lemon sobert green tea was really fragrant and light on your sense, plus we all loved the presentation! don\'t bother with the brunch dish(can\'t even remember the name), it was just sad compared to others
Cheese infused cream sauce with mushroom and bacon 
Served piping hot, Supply &amp; Demand\'s addictive thick cut fries are drizzled with truffle oil and topped with shaved parmesan and an entire roasted garlic (to ward off any vampires and humans).
9 inches The Morning After pizza, served with tomato sauce, mozzarella, bacon and mushroom with a soft egg set in the centre. simply perfect! 
pancetta e funghi - cheese infused cream sauce with mushroom and bacon.
The pork sausage platter ($18) from Supply &amp; Demand. It\'s an assortment of mangalica, chorizo, oriental and Chinese pork sausage served with an Asian spicy dip and onion relish.
A place great for groups!! Wide variety of pizza selections! &amp; their Al-fungi pasta deserve a second serving (which I did had haha) 👍ambience &amp; service.
1. Fries with a Side of Guilt ($14)\n<br />2. Salsiccia and Morning After 2-in -1 pizza.
So I ordered this as well (Mushroom Pizza)? It is just meh to me, there are definitely pizzas out there that are even better 😌. It is just decent! \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Carbonara was just average, too creamy for my liking. But still, extremely popular. Guess everyone has their own preference of taste 😅\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Crusp thin crust topped with egg, mushroom, bacon. Can finish the whole pizza myself! Rating: 3.8/5
The pasta was much springier and more thoroughly cooked, and the tomatoes were infused with herbs and fragrance from the shrimp. The cheese topping was amazingly fresh! I would say you MUST order this if you\'re dining here.
Bacon, mushroom and soft egg - a combination that can never go wrong on a pizza! Supply &amp; Demand\'s thin crust pizzas are freshly made hence the waiting time but I will be back for more and I have yet to try their truffles fries!
Springy pasta in light and sweet garlic infused white wine sauce was super good. Clams were fresh. Friendly staff. Would definitely go back for this! Rating: 4.5/5
The chocolate &amp; pink guava is so good!! Not very sweet ice cream too.
Raw Thai Scallop Tiradito @ $9 - the sauce is very tasty, but the dish is not worth the price. scallop are slice thin like a paper, perhaps there\'s only 1.5 scallop use here.
YUMS, not overly creamy or salty, pasta is Al Dente (tender but slightly firm to the bite).
My friend and I shared the garlic truffle fries, pasta and tea. A lot of people say supply and demand is overrated. But I find it living up to its hype. I absolutely love the pasta which has a subtle taste of white wine. It\'s definitely a good places to gather with a bunch of old friends to catchup. 
Not too bad! More unique than the usual #Schwarzwalderkirschtorte! Yeah, that\'s it\'s #German name. Haha
Wanted to try this after seeing so many posts on the pizza in instagram! As usual, it looks super photogenic. Taste wise is not bad but service is a little slow! So recommend to go early or make reservation! 😀#photogenicfood
Half of the side is topped with parma ham, rucola salad and parmesan cheese while the other half is filled with chicken chunks and a soft egg set in the center. Plentiful of fresh and chunky ingredients was topped on the crispy thin crust pizza and baked to perfection. The soft egg in Provinciale does magic and enhances the flavor of pizza.
$23 for full portion. Still craving for vongole so went for this instead of the more value for money lunch set ($16.90++) pasta in tasty garlic infused white wine sauce though it lacked the mild spiciness I\'d like. portion was just right for me. Downside was that service was so slow!
Favourite truffle wedges, a Farley big portion for sharing but faster finger wins! 
Round Midnight $18 (reg, 9\"), $22 (large, 13\") | pizzas are supposedly cooked in a wood-fired oven, yet ours had no fragrant smoky or charred aroma. I didn\'t really like it because it wasn\'t hot enough, and they were quite stingy with the toppings. Our first thought was, \"Woah, taste like lao hong (Hokkien for soggy, deflated)\". It had a sourish taste from the heavy tomato base.
Pizza for dessert because our mains arrived first (also, halfway into mains, our cold cut platter arrived). The apologetic waitstaff explained that there\'s a 45-minute wait for pizza, but we were never informed. 😭 The pizza\'s not bad, but defo not worth the wait. Thankfully, the great company saved the night.
Just looking at it makes me hungry. It makes you keep coming for it, trust me! Their garlic truffle fries is good!! I am not someone that can stand the taste of garlic but surprisingly, this is different. Might try their pizza next time.
Truffle, egg and wild rocket, taste so good when eaten together!
Went straight for polenta because I like the taste of corn and like the gritty texture. However, it came too soggy 😔 which was weird, since only the eggs came in contact with it. At least it was yummy and the parma ham was good. 
Met the girls for a chit chat session, and was immediately attracted to their extensive list of tea. Didn\'t expect it to come w a muffin and biscuit. But after that I saw the price and realised why. It was 9.90++ haha. But the tea was pretty fragrant!
Best truffle fries I\'ve had in Singapore thus far! Each thick-cut fry was well-coated with truffle oil so the condiments didn\'t dilute the truffle taste, which was great.
I was sold by the fact that the #pizza was served with an #egg in the middle and had to order it. Lol. Great #crispy thin #crust, but toppings-wise I felt it was pretty average. Nevertheless I\'ll come back again to try their other dishes! 😁
IMO, really thin pizza cooked to perfection but apart from their poached egg in the middle, the pizza is rather mediocre, not something I would queue 45 mins and another 20 mins waiting time for it.
One of the better truffle fries thus far! Especially with the taste of garlic(though some ppl don\'t really take a liking to it)
Seafood pasta in white wine / Smoked salmon &amp; avocado salad / Raw thai fish tiradito / Aglio Olio w shrimps 🍴 Would recommend the Raw thai fish coz its fresh n refreshing, great starter! Pastas are moderate.
We reached at around 6:30 on a Friday evening at this cafe located at orchard gateway. I was surprised that there was already a small queue forming considering that it\'s still quite early. We ordered the sweet potato fries, pizza and carbonara. The first two dishes were delish, esp the pizza with it\'s thin crust and generous toppings. The carbonara however fell short of taste. We had to ask for extra pepper and salt to add to our dish. The sauce was fairly blend (unless you happen to be someone who has blend taste buds). Overall the experience was good but for those who expect them self to reach any later than 7, I will highly encourage you to call in first to make a reservation. By 7:30 there were already 22 slots that are waiting for their turn. 
Rich chocolate, I didn\'t manage to finish it. Too much for one, ideal for sharing :)
I always like thin crust pizza, would\'ve been better if it\'s more crispy
$16.90 lunch set: anitpasti, bread and cheese, chef\'s random mushroom chicken. Pretty good. \n<br />#burpple
Never tried something worse than this. Pasta tasted so plain (felt like there was just dosage of black pepper and nothing else) it tasted so awfully dry 
I would happily say I\'m NEVER coming back here again 
Together with very attentive staff and pretty setup, it was a great start to the long weekend! 🎉
Tantalising aroma, and love how the garlic was grilled so well. Truffle flavour could have been better though | ★★★☆☆
The Morning After is inspired by the chef\'s favourite breakfast ingredients – that’s mushroom, bacon and soft egg on a pizza.
Eat the egg up, grab a slice up &amp; put it in your mouth. The ingredients are mighty Freshy, the tomato sauce base is a bit salty. The craft beers are must try. Bad playlist btw. Overall: 3/5
Leave it to the chef to decide on the cooking method! One of the dishes which I definitely order when I\'m at S&amp;D. Makes a hearty and value-for-money meal!
the truffle fries were meh 😐. the waitress still boasted that they were on someone\'s top 20 truffle fries list . oh please. the pizza were much better. de truffles on it were oh so awesome 😍😍
In the mood of wine? Ask for their merlot by the glass!
I\'m so pleasantly surprised by how good the pumpkin bread is...toasted so well.
Unlike a ceviche which usually comes in cubes of fish, the tiradito comes in thinly sliced strips of fresh, raw fish. What you\'ll find here at Supply &amp; Demand however, is not your classic Peruvian take on the dish. While methods of preparation might be similar, the people over at Supply &amp; Demand have decided to do it fusion style: Thai + Peruvian. A wonderful combination of Cilantro Lime, chilli and sesame dressing with fresh slices of raw fish topped off with some salad. One of the better and more affordable starters that I\'ve come across in a long while.
Thin crusted pizzas are de rigueur these days, which can get a little boring. It also means that having so many other shops to compete and be compared with, the pizza better be average at the very least. Personally, I\'m not a huge fan of thin crusted pizzas because if I\'m going to be eating something sinful, it might as well be chunky. It\'s not like \"skinny\" or \"thin\" pizza is gonna make me slim down. Anyway, my expectations for thin crusted pizzas are as follows: I expect a moderately thin crust, allowing a slightly crisp and chewy texture with each bite.The mozzarella cheese must be warm and full of stringy, gooey goodness. The toppings must be generous, but still well balanced out with the crust and the cheese, it must not steal the spotlight entirely. As such, the Prosciutto Di Parma from Supply &amp; Demand would only rank as average on my pizza list. It was served slightly warm, with a slightly thicker than usual cut of Parma ham on each slice of pizza. The rocket salad that came with the pizza was rather fresh and not overly bitter. Generous shavings of Parmesan cheese were scattered all over the pizza and went well with the slight bitterness of Rucola. The tomato sauce was average at best. The crust wasn\'t a good balance of chewiness and crisp, also lacking the slightly charred, more traditional flavours of a wood fired pizza. It also tasted like the dough lacked fermentation, affecting the flavour of the dough. Perhaps I am a sucker for the traditional methods of baking pizza. Supply &amp; Demand definitely doesn\'t have one of the best grub around but it serves decent food in a nice setting at a very convenient location. The hunt for my ideal pizza continues.
Street/hawker food found on a restaurant\'s menu has always had an appeal to me. If under less comfortable conditions, the hawkers and street vendors can already come up with such marvellous tasting dishes, what could the chefs in a restaurant, with their advanced equipment and huge kitchens, whip up? When the satay was served, it certainly looked promising: served on a steel mesh placed atop a candle with vegetables and peanut sauce on the side. After quickly snapping a picture of the dish, I placed a skewer into my mouth slowly, eagerly anticipating a hot-off-the-grill, smoky, charred chunk of chicken meat. This was not to be. While the meat was tender, I felt that the skewers here lacked the smoky, slightly charred qualities of street stalls. Also, the meat was at room temperature, which probably meant this was prepared in advance and left at a side till an order came in. I then decided to try another skewer after leaving it on the mesh for a while, with hope that the tiny flame from the candle placed below would be of help and eventually came to a conclusion that the candle was placed there purely for decorative purposes. It probably would help a little if they heated their spicy peanut sauce up to compensate for the skewers which were at room temperature or provided a sizeable flame/ charcoal below the steel mesh. What a waste to pair a flavourful peanut sauce with chicken prepared like that. Well, if they\'re supplying this, I don\'t think I\'ll be demanding it.
Price is reasonable, spaghetti was cooked to al dente. However, the sauce was only satisfactory.
Ordered this Cucumber Mint Green Tea to try. Initially was skeptical about the taste, cos cucumber sounds raw. However, the taste of cucumber was subtle and the mint was refreshing yet not overpowering. The tea is selling at $9.90++ per pot, best part is that you can keep on adding hot water. It was served with a small muffin and cookie... Quite an interesting combination and the tea was kept hot throughout with the lighted tea candle. 
This fushion dish worked out pretty well adding a touch of spice with the sambal. Fret not should you be looking for purely Italian pasta. The bulk of the menu consist of Italian food with a small section of Asian inspired dishes for those who have cravings for spicier flavours.
An interesting western twist to an Asian favourite. The Otak was coated with an outer layer of deep fried bread crumps resulting in what could be a spicy version of fish fingers.
Always a fan of Italian food, I believe the ambience at the esplanade\'s outlet is better since they have a rooftop bar. for those who don\'t drink, the newly open branch at orchard gateway will be good. Nice interior and pretty quiet since I was there on a Monday evening. Ordered the morning after pizza ($18 for 9inches) soft egg in the centre with bacon, spinach and tomato paste. Very disappointed as it does not taste as good as it looks. The thin crust was rather tough and soggy, not worth trying. The service was however worth a shoutout. Very attentive.
Haha....i just had to order this for dessert. Definitely a disaster to my diet plans. Chocolate Eclairs, chocolate brownie chunks, cookie crumble with layers of vanilla cream topped with sliced bananas.
They do pretty good pizzas here too with some interesting names. \"The morning after\" consisted of tomato sauce, mozzarella, bacon and mushroom with a soft egg set in the centre
Ordered this from the Carte Blanc section of the menu where the chef decides how to cook the meat you order. Fish of the day was rock fish which was fleshy and firm.
Supply an Demand is an Italian restaurant but they do have a couple of dishes with an Asian twist as well. This one had some thai influences. They do serve satay here as well. Yet the quality of food is maintained which is usually not the case when a restaurant has one too many cuisines.
Decent detailing of tea set up, huge variety of tea selection and Eco-looking cafe concept. Supply and Demand did it all, tea in the noon &amp; beer at night marketing strategy work hand in hand. If you look for a place to chill, yep.. This is it.
This came as a surprise. Compliments from the chef. Panna cotta was light with very subtle hints of the tea.
Certain parts of the chicken was dry. The deep fried stuff reminds me of yam cake.
Looks so nice like an afternoon tea set. They gave a rosemary cookie and banana cake along with the tea.The rosemary cookie was pretty good.

love this!!!! chunky fries with hint of garlic 👍 yummy 💕
Italien food after watching Inferno :)
Never have I described a cake as disgusting but having tried this..I must say..It was disgusting. The yuzu tasted off and there was hardly an Earl Grey taste in the mousse. Perhaps the yuzu taste masked it. But this was definitely one of the worst cakes I\'ve ever had. DO NOT TRY IT.
Ok, that\'s all.

The rempeyek was crispy and fresh. Samosa was a bit bland. The dish is more like a dry curry style with lots of onions but without the major flavors that I’m used too such as  Malay or Thai curry. It’s not particularly spicy either. However it is served hot &amp; the portion is pretty large specially with the rice and fried egg.  Likely to put you into a food coma after lunch. $16.90++.

We liked the 3 mini appetizers that came with it, and was pleasantly surprised at the huge portion of chicken (half chicken) that was served up.

The carbonara was quite impressive! I shared this with a friend, together with the Morning After pizza and truffle fries (which proved to be too much haha) but I highly recommend this pasta. It was creamy but not overboard and the penne was perfect for sharing. There\'s a tasting option for $14 and a full option for $18. We went for the full but it was just right for 2, if you aren\'t a heavy eater, the tasting portion may be the better choice :)
☆☆☆☆ One of the better ones in sg
Ah before that, a slice of pizza perhaps?
The main highlight of this place is the pizza however, i decided to try the pasta for a change! Cream based pasta was the choice made and boyyy, t\'was good! Alongside with the appetizers which is, potato wedges, with cheese sauce, and jalapeno together with BBQ sauce, awesome. 
Just enjoying some good pizza 🍕
Unlike those you find at Pizza Hut, these pizzas are the thin crusted ones. The regular 9 inch pizzas are priced at $18, while the large 13 inch pizzas are priced at $22. Apart from pizzas, they do serve pasta [$13-$17] and other main course including Asian inspired dishes. Opens daily. #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie  #sgcafe #instafoodsg #sgfoodiary #burpple #pizza #pasta
Love this!
Rich &amp; good, sweetness is perfect to me.
Rich, luscious chocolate, spiked with cherry liqueur. perfect harmony!
Pizza regular 9\" @ $18 + $3 for 2 flavours in 1 pizza\n<br />top: Truffle and egg\n<br />(tomato sauce, black truffle paste, rucola leaves and a soft egg set in the center) - some what, didn\'t like it that much cos it was salty to me.\n<br />bottom: the morning after\n<br />(tomato sauce, mozzarella, bacon and mushroom with an soft egg set in the center) - love, love, love!

Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. Wonderfully truffley!!
Phat and crunchy are the prawns! 4/5
How did it fare! Review on Supply and Demand up on fatassbean.wordpress.com! Link up on bio!
Two of my favourite items on the menu!!
I didn\'t enjoy the sausages for this one...
Like the thin crust and truffle paste~
Major yum~ 😘😘 best truffle fries ever!!
😋
So I asked for recommendations! The chocolate cake is really nice!
And the fish of the day is snapper
It was ok, you can give it a miss
Hands down for this, gobbled it within minutes. Certainly worth trying
Fresh prawns paired with avocado
Better than the fries from P.S cafe. I am also a fan of shoe-string fries btw.
The chef decides on the fish and cooking style.

They so-called \'torte\' is nothing but a thin layer of dense cake at the bottom. Alas! The gelato isn\'t nice either. It\'s just like eating whipped cream with bland frozen ice. Definitely needs some improvements. ***********************************************\n<br />#sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodie #foodies #foodgram #igsg #sgblogger #igfood #100happydays #cafesg #vsco #instafood #sgig #sgfoodie #chef #avocado #sweet #desserts #foodblogger #foodcoma #gelato #torte #cake #whippedcream #supplyanddemand#burpple
The filling and the sauce are equally tasty. However, there\'s slight smell of bacon 😔 ***********************************************\n<br />#sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #singapore #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodie #foodies #foodgram #igsg #igfood #100happydays #cafesg #vsco #gastronomy #instafood #sgcafe #sgig #sgfoodie #sgrestaurant #italian #italianrestaurant #pasta #yummy #foodcoma #ravioli #supplyandemand #orchardgateway @supplydemandsin @orchardgatewaysg #burpple
The food is so tasty. The aglio olio is unlike the normal, boring one, but tossed in chili oil and fragrant garlic slices. The bruschetta has different layers of flavours. Sour, salty, and refreshing. I just found my new favorite place in the heart of Orchard! ***********************************************\n<br />#sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #singapore #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodie #foodies #foodgram #igsg #igfood #100happydays #cafesg #vsco #gastronomy #instafood #sgcafe #sgig #sgfoodie #sgrestaurant #italian #italianrestaurant #pasta #aglioolio #spaghetti #bruschetta #supplyandemand #orchardgateway @supplydemandsin @orchardgatewaysg #burpple
👍 al Dante and very garlicalicious 😁
Another dish from the Carte Blanc section of the menu where the chef decides how to cook the dish. There is also a wide selection of wine and beer to go with your food. And also a wide selection of tea to perk up your day.
Pretty yummy. Bread was served warm
