Crab Bee Hoon. Fresh crab in milky, crab broth. Yums! 
The crab is deep fried first before stir frying with golden salted egg yolk &amp; curry leaves. Crab is fresh &amp; of the right texture. One of the best salted egg yolk crabs I\'ve eaten in Singapore. 
Such a satisfying meal with @gracechoong! Still feeling bloated from the crab beehoon, coffee pork ribs &amp; shanghai cabbage!
We ordered #venison on #hotplate, #asparagus #scallops #stirfried with #XOsauce and #BlackPepperCrab. \n<br />To my surprise everything was so nice! #burp \n<br />Worth a try and I’m definitely returning again. 😋\n<br />#foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia

This dish is so yummy that it deserves a photo feature on its own.  So loving the robust and superbly flavourful broth. Mmmm! (Date: 26 August 2016 Friday) #MsJaniceEats_Birthday\n<br />#MsJaniceEats_ChineseRestaurant #MsJaniceEats_WaterwayPoint

Must order local ChiliCrabs never disappoint me. Their crabs are huge and fresh, the Chili so good that you must order some mantous 馒头 to dip it! I even see someone drink the Chili leh!! #uncleleongsignatures #chilicrab #burpple #burpplesg
