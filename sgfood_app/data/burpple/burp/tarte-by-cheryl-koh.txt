$9 for a tart this tiny, it\'s not longer just about watching your waistline! Tried the Hojicha Creme Brulee tart &amp; the Pistachio Frangipane tart (as shown here). A small price to pay if your dreams haven\'t been so sweet lately.
Her flagship store: Tarte by Cheryl Koh at Shaw Centre serves one of most delectable tart desserts one palette could crave for.
I finally understand why the tarts here are spoken of in hushed tones of reverence. This seasonal cherry one was heavenly. Love how the sweet fruit, chilled vanilla custard cream and crisp buttery base came together in supreme perfection. 
Helmed by Les Amis Restaurant\'s pastry chef and Asia\'s Best Pastry Chef 2016 Cheryl Koh, Tarte is a crowd favourite pastry shop in town. You\'ll find no fancy, over-the-top decorations here, just \"the best version of the simplest desserts\". There are two tart sizes available, with seasonal flavours appearing occasionally. If you know the particular flavour the birthday girl or boy wants, call ahead to pre-order a large tart ($38 for 16cm). If not, order a good array of the smaller tarts ($9 for 8cm) to share. Go for the best-selling Pistachio ($9) — velvety smooth, creamy filling full of nutty goodness encased in a thin but sturdy buttery tart shell, with a garnish of crushed pistachios. Also look out for the seasonal tarts like the Tasmanian Cherry, Alphonso Mango and the luscious Passionfruit. If you\'re planning to swing by for a particular flavour, though, it\'s worth calling ahead, as they run out pretty quickly. \n<br />*38cm tarts have to be ordered two days in advance\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Nobelle Liew
The luscious mini melon balls have a sweet, disarmingly sincere juiciness that never borders on watery, whilst elsewhere the milky panna cotta wobbles with a tightrope walker\'s confident steadiness and the softly firm crust surrenders unyieldingly to the side of your fork without crumbling. 4.2/5
Iranian pistachio frangipane with light pistachio cream (Delivered by @Uber_SING #UberEATS; use \'eats-uberbryandmlee\' for $10 off your first order!)
There are times when a whole cake\'s just too much for a celebration, and that\'s when these divine pastries come in. These are also perfect when you\'re looking for something light(er) but still a crowd-pleaser. 
I heart all her tarts! The dark cherry and pistachio are my favorites. Love love love!
lump, crunchy, sweet cherries, a delicate crème patissiere, buttery crisp shortcrust pastry — what\'s there not to like? This seasonal tart is one I\'m always looking forward to; so guys, now that it\'s out, have at it before it\'s gone again!
Looks nothing like the messy American sandwich, but trust me this delicate and dainty dessert packs quite the punch. Imagine the gao-est peanut butter you\'ve tasted, presented as the lightest creamy mousse, atop a nutty frangipane/feuilletine-like base and a crisp  pâte sucre so so sinful, but so so addictive. I like how the \"jelly\" component comes n the shape of fresh, surprisingly sweet raspberries, that stopped it all from getting too heavy and jelak.
Settling for nothing less than the best for  my tart fix. Haven\'t been there in the longest time, and I\'m mega happy that the tarts are still 💪🏻💪🏻👌🏻👌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 absolutely in love with the Apple, a newer flavour I believe cause I\'ve never had it before!! Gonna go all out and call it the BEST apple tart I\'ve ever had.
 The tart looks pretty ,not very sweet  but very small which I find it a bit exp .
The contract between the crunchy juicy cherries and the smooth sweet vanilla custard makes it so yummy to have. \n<br />On the side note, took the pic from the wrong side LOL.
The Cherry Tart ($9) from Tarte has returned, albeit for a brief period due to the seasonality, so do get yours before they run out soon! Oh and I heard their mango tarts are available in store now too... But sadly it was sold out when we were there yesterday.\n<br />.\n<br />Tarte by Cheryl Koh\n<br />Address: 1, Scotts Road, Shaw Centre, Unit 01-12, Singapore 228208

Our first reaction when this place first opened (and before she was named Best Pastry Chef by San Pellegrino) was, \"huh who\'s Cheryl Koh?\" But after hearing she was Les Amis\' pastry chef we decided to give her some cred.. Mangoes are in season and they really did shine here - sweet and tender (but barely any tartness). However, below the bed of artfully sliced and glazed mangoes, the vanilla crème pat hits you in the face.. But it\'s also really, really luscious, velvetly but light and ugh damn delicious. The pistache was absolutely gorgeous with finely chopped pistachio nuts mixed into and flavouring the crème pat.. It made me miss all the pistachio-flavoured gelatos in rome. Also, DAT. BUTTERY. BASE. Yum. More next time.
$9. Small but the mango was fresh and sweet. None of the cloyingly sweet artificial nastiness in other places. 
You might miss Tarte by Cheryl Koh at first glance, as it’s a hole in the wall with only a narrow space on the ground floor of Shaw Centre. This boutique outfit is helmed by Cheryl Koh, named Asia’s Best Pastry Chef in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants Awards 2016. The tarts here may be small in size, but they are big on flavour, and you probably won\'t be just eating one. Be warned.
These tarts were little but they were deliciouuuuuuussssss~ Could actually share this between 4 people and still feel satisfied 😛
I\'ve been meaning to try these for the longest time- twice I\'ve been in the area and both times they were closed. So nothing\'s better than coming home to see these three beauties sitting pretty in my fridge 🙈. The family was impressed by the quality and flavours of all three. Each of them had its own unique personality, but cradled by the same thin and crisp shell. The pistachio was my personal favourite, just look at that envious green! Followed closely by the orange which was a surprise because I wasn\'t expecting such a lovely lemony filling beneath. I love me a good ole lemon tart, the more tart the better (pun intended 😉). The strawberry was as perfect as a strawberry tart can get, but somehow it didn\'t have any \"oomph\" factor. Does that even make sense? Haha I wonder as I type this, do readers get what I\'m trying to convey with my word vomit. Or are there even readers at all... 🙃
Can\'t believe we got lucky and managed to snag two of the seasonal Tasmanian Cherry ($9) tarts (which tastes more like sweet grapes actually)!! So yummy and definitely worth the price! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 #burpple
5 munchies: You have no idea how much I wanted to try the Cherry Tart after missing out the last season. Topped with Tasmanian cherries on a light vanilla cream, the thin, golden-brown crust flaked in my mouth into buttery shards. Those fresh cherries – my goodness. They\'ve got to be the sweetest and crunchiest I\'ve ever had!

Tasmanian cherry tart is back! So so happy to have finally tasted this - plump, sweet and juicy cherries sitting atop a light vanilla cream and crispy buttery tart base 👌
Really tangy tart with buttery tart base. One of the more expensive tarts of this size that I have had. 
A Mixed Berries Tart would be good now.. Though my favourite is still the cherry tart.
Anyway have you participated in the giveaway yet? 5 premium grabz membership to be won. Link in bio.
One of the best new openings of 2015, in my opinion.\n<br />The seasonal pear tart is divine, with soft, thin slices of wine-poached pear fanning out across vanilla bean custard.\n<br />#bestfoodmemory2015
One of the best new openings of 2015, in my opinion.
Glazed berries heaped on creme patissiere, on a dense frangipane tart base. Not my favourite tart here, but that gleam and the jewel tones are certainly beguiling.
One of Tarte\'s latest flavour.
Coconut And Kaya Tart
Boy, have I missed Tarte\'s tarts! Picked three new creations, which gave me mixed feelings. The mango was lovely; as I would expect from Tarte which excels particularly at fruit tarts, the earl grey was pleasant, and the Mont Blanc-ish chestnut was slightly disappointing; though light in texture and not cloying at all, I wished for a richer chestnut flavour.
The use of Harum Manis mango is an ingenious idea as it is (in my opinion) one of the best mangoes in the world. The flesh is sweet and since it is not in season, it must have come at really premium pricing!
I highly recommend grabbing a box of chouquettes (bite sized choux pastry with studs of pearl sugar) on your way in, supremely addictive; I could pop these puffs all day. \n<br />Thankful to have such wonderful tasting neighbours, I mean tarts, within close proximity ☺️ 8bucks/tart
Critrusy, has enough oomph to it due to the lime, it is very appetizing and fresh. With a sip of earl grey tea after a bite, the fragrance from both fused and engulfed my mouth, making it a pleasant combination and in refreshing my tastebuds. 
Rich, creamy and smooth rendition of an earl grey tarte. Crust was thick enough which I like, consumed w the gooey filling just makes it a perfect afternoon. The piece of chocolate atop did not clash w the flavor of the tarte and is a good addition so it wouldn\'t be plain. Ambience is nice and relaxing, a good place to have high tea there while people watching or w some company. 
Finally got the chance to taste these tarts from Tarte by Cheryl Koh! Worth the hype. I chose earl grey tea over the other two which I kept for my parents to eat. Earl grey tea was a crème brûlée! The tart base was not too thick nor thin, a little crunchy alongside w the sweet and creamy earl grey crème brûlée and a piece of white chocolate placed on top. Will be back again for more choices next time! 
Dark Chocolate Tart ($9). Wanted to try the coffee tart but it was not available so i settled on this. Damn this was good! Smooth velvety chocolate ganache with a slight bitter end to it! Dark chocolate lovers will definitely love this! 
As we were driving towards Far East, I saw Shaw Centre and told baby about Tarte. And so we walked over after I am done with nails. \n<br />Located along the quaint street corner of Shaw Centre, stood a pretty looking little shop featuring fresh and tantalizing tarts by Chef Cheryl Koh. \n<br />The shop has an elegant and minimalist appeal, with an array of tarts to choose from. Customers can either take-away or have their tarts served at next door Caveau Bar and enjoy their tarts in a cosy and sophisticated ambience over a coffee or tea. \n<br />I choose their signature Raspberry dark chocolate tart (S$9+). With dark chocolate aplenty and raspberry jam at the bottom + a nutty biscuit crust, topped with raspberries and gold foil, I really love that it\'s not overly sweet. Yummilicious! \n<br />Baby had another of their popular choice - Caramel Hazelnut tart (S$9+). I think this is too sweet for me, but baby loves this. I love the crunch of hazelnut but I thought it could be less sweet. \n<br />We really love our tarts and I think we will be back for more!
Looking to end the weekends on a sweet note? How about the tarts from Tarte by Cheryl Koh? I\'m in love with the Pistachio tart (tart on the left). Full of nutty goodness that wasn\'t overly sweet nor creamy, the tart came out to be well-balanced and largely flavourful. Excited to try the other tarts next time! 
It\'s my 3rd visit here and i still fall for its tarts! this time round i ordered creme brulee and white peach. both tasted good but i still prefer their pistachio. it\'s uh ma zing 😍
It was in the hallowed kitchen of Chef Ken Hoh\'s Third Floor that I learned and appreciated the elegance of this fruit\'s harmoniously balanced citrus and floral notes. This was of course after many failed attempts at making the sauce for the restaurant\'s signature duck dish. Now, back to this glorious yuzu tart. It is the epitome of culinary tome-perfect #dessert – the sablé base just firm enough to hold the filling, and the yuzu custard just tart enough to tantalise the palate. Ok, that\'s all.
- Plump sweet Blueberries with blackcurrant curd on almond frangipane.
Because like pizzas, anything is possible when it comes to the filling/topping of a tart. Yet, the most important component of it all is still its base. Here, the short crust is executed flawlessly the French way...which means you get a firm crust that breaks easily and does not leave crumbs. And butter, lots of butter.
Of Cacao Barry 72% dark chocolate with raspberry jam topped with a nutty biscuit and raspberries with that luxurious gold foil.
... to get you hooked. As usual, my eyes zoomed in to the blueberry tarts the moment they landed on the display (I really really like blueberry foods). It looks so simple, but with every burst of the plump berries that causes the sweet juice to amalgamate with the slightly tangy curd and crunchy crust, my heart squeals in delight. I am soooooo going back for more, can\'t have too much sugar in one sitting 😔
I am not a fan of tarts until I tried this. The sweetness is just nice and the white peach doesnt taste v off.

Tarte by Cheryl Koh. Love the hard shortcrust but the flavors are kinda muted for me. Well.. Looking forward to tarts with my favorite pandas @therantingpanda this weekend!
Finally get to try the tarts. Like their Earl Grey tart more! 
This place is too dangerously close to my dentist and I\'m seeing her pretty often now for my braces! 😁😁 Think I\'m obsessed with tarts these days. #gettingfat #foodie
is one of the tarts I alway like to go for. The tangy passionfruit curd and beautifully toasted meringue with a flaky tart base is just a delightful treat!
The handmade pastry tart shell was a big win for me. This one was filled with chocolate feuillitine, creamy gooey caramel and large chunks of roasted hazelnuts.  9bucks/tart 
Raspberry Lychee Tart (Seasonal): Raspberry yogurt filling encased in buttery crust, topped with lychee bits, fresh raspberries &amp; pistachios. Not too sweet with slight tang &amp; hint of raspberry. Gotta be my favourite after Caramel Hazelnut &amp; Cherry tart. \n<br />Yuzu Tart - Yuzu curd with lime in buttery, flaky crust. Was disappointed that the curd do not have the slightest hint of yuzu as it was overpowered by lime &amp; was a little too tangy for my liking.
Like a dark, roasty Kopi Gao fantasy. 3.9/5
I lost count on how much I have raved about the tarts or recommend it to my friends, but if you are going to Tarte by Cheryl Koh, please do try the Cherry Tart ($9). The sweetness from the Spanish cherries and lightness of the vanilla cream is just pure bliss and indulgence. Together with the buttery pastry crust, it\'s just amazingly good. Best to consume them on the spot or within three hours upon takeaway.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping
I am not a pastry chef and never a food connoisseur, but if a place is so good that I keep going back then it must serve some pretty kickass stuff.

Essentially succulent, posh plum-grape hybrids on a tart dressed by Vivienne Westwood. 4/5 
On an otherwise manic Monday, looking at the clock and seeing that work is ending soon brings a smile on my face. For all the stress and hard work, I think I deserve a sweet treat soon. Looking through the photos in my album, I think the most appropriate thing to post now is the seasonal Raspberry Lychee Tart ($8) from Tarte by Cheryl Koh. The fresh raspberries with the distinctive lychee flavoured filling and buttery pastry crust (that makes me think back to Chinese New Year goodies) is a sure-winner. Guess I will need to plan a trip down to Tarte soon.
|\n<br />The one at the back was the Pandan Coconut with Mango Tarte. The filling tasted like a pandan cake on a buttery tart base but the mango was overpowered. .\n<br />|\n<br />Milo Chocolate Tarte was good with its creamy chocolaty filling but I would prefer a stronger and bitter chocolate.
The thing that always impresses me most about Tarte\'s tarts is how delicately thin the pastry is rolled, yet it\'s firm and crisp enough to hold all that luscious, creamy filling without crumbling. The tart shell is so slender that from a bird\'s eye view, you can\'t even glimpse its edges underneath its toppings.
I love pistachio &amp; this tart is just Amazing! The texture is fine and creamy. I can taste the quality ingridients used to make the tarts. The crust has a nice butter scent too. It\'s worth my moolah for this tart 😆 》$9
I know this isn\'t news anymore, but Cheryl Koh\'s tarts never cease to amaze me. Sure there are other lovely tart joints on this teeny island; yet none other has offered such a variety of seasonal tarts, made with the freshest premium ingredients, and maintained consistent quality. Pictured here\'s the Pistachio (S$9) which uses Iranian green pistachios, resulting in a fragrant and earthy delight.
Had been wanting to get the tarts from here but either it\'s sold out or the store\'s closed, so when I\'m finally able to get my hands on them I decided to get three tarts too - Passionfruit Meringue ($8), Caramel Hazelnut ($9) and Cherry ($9). These artisans tarts will make you\'ll relish every spoonful!
I guess the same would apply to the coffee tart that the staff tried to recommend to me yesterday. •
Refreshing, not too sweet, and very refined. Definitely for cherry-lovers!
Two of them (Pistachio and Strawberry) are actually meant for my grandmother 😘. The tarts come in two sizes and I got the small ones for the four flavours. They are priced between $8 and $9 each.
It\'s the third time I\'m having this, and I\'m still amazed at the wonderful flavours packed into this teeny bite. This is not your average flavoured tart - the fragrant Iranian pistachios are the real deal. It\'s the perfect example of how simple quality ingredients can lend to a stunning dish.
In one of my previous posts, I mentioned that there was one tart that totally blew my mind away and stole the show. Today, I shall reveal it and it\'s none other than the Cherry Tart ($9). Before that, I was not really a cherry person and would avoid all forms of cherry-related products as most felt artificial (those used in iced jelly) or tastes like medicine (cherry drinks). It was a bittersweet moment as when we were queuing up, the customer in front of us bought the prettiest looking tart over the countertop and it happened to be the last piece. Never one to give up easily, we enquired with the friendly staff and they told us that we might have to wait for a bit because they are in the midst of preparing another flavours. We waited patiently for it and was rewarded with a fresh batch of Cherry Tart, which has Spanish cherries on a light vanilla cream. To me, it was an unexpected order and the Cherry Tart won with a landslide victory.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping
There are only a handful of places that will make me revisit them time and time again - Tarte By Cheryl Koh is one of them. In one of my previous posts, I mentioned that there was one tart that totally blew my mind away and stole the show. Today, I shall reveal it and it\'s none other than the Cherry Tart ($9). Before that, I was not really a cherry person and would avoid all forms of cherry-related products as most felt artificial (those used in iced jelly) or tastes like medicine (cherry drinks).

Tarte by Cheryl Koh is known for their perfect execution on tarts, and this Lemon Tart is no exception. Loved how the tart base held up without crumbling into a mess as usual, and the lemon curd was of a nice balance of tartness and sweetness, refreshing the tastebuds while the slice of lemon above was surprisingly not as sour as expected, and that it actually released lemon zest to further bring out the flavours of the lemon curd.
Helmed by Cheryl Koh, pastry chef behind the successful Les Amis, I finally made my way to Tarte by Cheryl Koh, located also at Shaw Centre. I was spoilt for choice looking at the various tarts on display at the glass counter and without much hesitation, pointed at the Lemon Tart ($8). The lemon curd is sour and matches perfectly with the tartness from the pastry. This  rendition of lemon tart is definitely ranked as my top few choices, together with my other favourites such as Two Bakers and Kilo. However, both my girl and myself agreed that one other tart from Cheryl Koh stole the show. It was something that we did not expect to order or like but it totally crushed the competition. Stay tuned for it :)
They all agree it\'s good especially my dad because he is hard to pleased lol. Love the fresh and flaky pastry tart 😌
It was rich, creamy, and nothing short of a caffeine punch. Paired with the superb pâte sucrée, the flavours and execution were perfect.
Saw a few of them overturned by the time I\'m home. Should have taken a picture before I turned them back. I\'m very sure it\'s not by us. Coz its safely held in the car by my daughter. \n<br />Lesson learned. Should have asked staff open up to see.
Les Amis\' Pastry Chef Cheryl Koh aims to deliver simple, classic and beautiful tarts. The buttery French base was firm and does not crumble easily.
It was so good and well balanced. It\'s simply my favorite tart place in Singapore and I don\'t mind keep coming back again for more!
One of the highlights of my past week: this impeccable tart that stars my favourite fruit.
Throwback to some really awesome tarts we had yesterday for tea. [Passionfruit Meringue S$8] - the tarts reminded me that I\'ve not had a good tart crust in a long while.
Finally got to try this highly raved tart. Crunchy tart base with vanilla custard and fresh fruits on top. But if you ask me whether it is worth $9.. I\'m afraid not. Maybe I\'ll try their other flavours to give a fair review.
About to make a move and realized the Pistachio tarts were just freshly baked out from the oven. 😍 |
If you like beauty stuff, do check out the magazine. It is really quite informative and interesting. And yes, e Passionfruit Meringue tart ($8) is da bomb! A tease for the tastebud. Citrusy passionfruit with buttery tart base and creamy meringue. What a lovely combo! So well balanced that I seriously dont mind having it everyday.
Smooth in texture but zingy in flavour, that bright yellow passionfruit curd is one eye-opener. The light sweetness of that gorgeously brûléed meringue on top, coupled with the crisp sable tart shell, is the perfect foil to the curd\'s citrusy tang.
While we loved the tart base and light cream, the fresh French strawberries surprised us on the downside with its sourness. Nonetheless, it made our calories count and we look forward to more of their seasonal creations!
After an internal battle, I got a hold of myself and only bought one Pistachio and Mango Tart (so proud of myself). The tarts are for take-away but you can opt to dine-in at the bar next door and order a cup of coffee or in my case.... iced chocolate (do note the tarts will be subjected to service charge when you dine-in). *This week might be the last week to get your hands on the Seasonal Fruit Tart sweet Indian alphonso tart with vanilla cream, so be quick!\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #tartebycherylkoh #tart #tarts #dessert #desserts #sgfood
A tart(e) kind of day.
🍒First time here and we were delighted by the pistachio tart. Definitely will be back to try their strawberry and caramel hazelnut tarts next 😘✨👌 #pearlspectives
Instead of being hard as some can be, the phenomenally sour lemon here is gloriously wet and almost runny, with the signature “chao tar” lemon rind offering some bitter sass to even the sour-sweet dynamics out. 4.1/5 
Plump, sweet &amp; so juicy! So good that I had it twice since its debut!
This favourite of mine is incredibly fragrant and packs so much texture into every compact bite – there\'s the crisp, crumbly pastry, the crunch of coarsely chopped hazelnuts, the stickiness of caramel... And can I just say this lattermost is just stellar?! It\'s got that gorgeous glossy colour that\'s neither too light nor too dark, which is indication even before tasting that the flavour is neither too weak nor has it been taken too far that it\'s burnt and bitter; it\'s spot-on.
Ordered 5 different flavors an shared among my friends. They have a bar area beside the tart shop so that we can dine in and enjoy.. Each tart costs about $7/8. My favourite was the coffee flavored tart, really could taste the bitterness of the coffee in the coffee mousse and the tart crusts were just baked to perfection!! Nothing I did not like at all! Also, when the barista at the bar was grinding coffee beans it smelt really good, maybe next time I will buy a cup of coffee to pair with my coffee tart! 
Les Amis pastry chef Cheryl Koh\'s tarts are just sublime – the hand-rolled pastry shells are impressively thin, and baked to such a perfectly crispy texture that you can hear a \"ci\" sound when you cut into it.
Love how simple the names of the tarts are :) Prices are a little steep here, considering the size of the tarts but delectable nonetheless. I love the lemon one the most, the sourness is just right!
And so, I head home with great satisfaction that:\n<br />1. My new pair of white pants survived a day out, unscathed.\n<br />2. I managed to try SIX tarts from Tarte by Cheryl Koh today, including this pretty thing of ultra-thin pastry cupping soft lemon curd and candied lemon slice.\n<br />3. I can look forward to a nice, relaxing long weekend 😌 .
Just before the weekend kicks in, we rejuvenated ourselves with some delectable tarts from my current favorite spot. Featuring the French Cherry Tart, another new and seasonal item from Chef Cheryl\'s pastry kitchen. Desserts anyone?
A stunning dessert, this mixed berry tart has everything a great fruit tart should: perfectly perpendicular pate sablee, delicate vanilla cream, and the freshest berries one could get. Gorgeous beyond compare.
Special delivery for the @sixthsensepr ladies on Thursday by @alainlicious. I am blessed with awesome friends!
Only a few tarts left. \n<br />I liked the Pistachio Tart ($9) made with toasted Iranian green pistachios, with smooth creamy pistachio filling, and not overly sweet. True enough, the buttery base was classic French, simple and firm, does not leave crumbs over as you bite into them.
Caramel-coated Piedmont hazelnuts with a thin layer of milk chocolate &amp; crunchy feuilletine encased in a light, buttery sweet pastry crust. Sooooo good!!!
Cheryl Koh, the group’s head baker, the tart specialist sells a selection of about 10 different tarts in two sizes: small ($8 to $9) and regular ($34). You can either takeaway or dine in at Caveau for tea to pair with your tarts.
Having eaten a couple of tarts before, this is the first time that I\'ve actually conquered 8/10 tarts within a week. Was stoked to find out that Cheryl just revealed a tart sweet pineapple in a strawberry form.
Back for the delectable desserts at Tarte By Cheryl Koh. I prefer the Caramel Hazelnut tart over the Pistachio tart because of the ultra crunchy texture, but my favorites are still their Dark Chocolate and seasonal Mango fruit. 
Tarte by Cheryl Koh is a new patisserie by the Les Amis group, located next to Caveau at Shaw Centre. Specialising in artisanal tarts and carolines (mini eclairs) for takeaway, they have plans to offer more items and desserts in the pipeline. Tarte uses quality ingredients such as Italian hazelnuts and pistachios, and offers its signature tarts in two sizes: small ($8 - $9) and regular ($30 - $34). Go for the Pistachio Tart ($9) with toasted pistachios and pistachio filling, or the Mango Tart with Indian Alphonso Mango ($8)!
A passionfruit meringue tart which looks like a flower petal to brighten up the day!
Tarte by Cheryl Koh, a new and highly anticipated takeaway retail pastry concept by award-winning Les Amis Group features limited quantities of artisanal tarts baked from scratch every morning with only the best sourced ingredients.
The fruit tarts here, such as this Mango tart here ($8) are made on order to ensure the freshness of the fruits. The Mango tart had a cream filling which is rather addictive to have and goes well with the sliced mangos.
Tarte by Cheryl Koh is the latest venture of the Les Amis Group, which specialises in French tarts. For today, the seasonal fruit tart is the Mango tart made with Indian Alphonsus Mangoes; extremely sweet yet tart in flavour, it sits atop cream which was lightly fragrant, and a tart base that was pretty light yet holds itself pretty firmly. If you do fancy dine-in, tell them and they could arrange you for a seat at next door Caveau Bar, where you can opt for a cup of coffee to go along with the tart.
A new tart shop with tart pastry chef Cheryl Koh at the helm, this shop is owned by Les Amis Group (which also runs the shops along the outdoor stretch of Shaw Centre) as one can go to the bar right beside this to have the tarts. The Coffee tart ($8) comes in a layer of Columbian coffee with creme brûlée right beneath it. A fantastic combination, as the creamy taste of the creme brûlée balances well with the coffee.
Tarte by Cheryl Koh is yet another venture by the Les Amis Group, specializing in French tarts. Coffee tart was my favourite, for its really rich and aromatic deep flavours of roasted Colombian coffee sitting atop a Creme Brûlée filling; pretty sweet and eggy. If you fancy dining in, tell them and they could arrange you a seat at Carveau Bar next door which you could sit down and have a cup of coffee while enjoying the tart.

The cherry.\n<br />🍒🍒\n<br />Seasonal. Liked the cherries on top. Unfortunately my fork could not break the tart as it was too hard. Alittle disappointed this time round as I have always liked their tarts.
Most recently, I tried the Cherry Tart and loved the lovely blood red colour and unique sour-sweet flavour and juiciness.
.\n<br />A superbly unctuous and flavorful passionfruit filling combined with a soft merengue and a buttery tart base. Superb 👌 👌 👌\n<br />.\n<br />#teatime #burpple
Tarte by Cheryl Koh had recently moved to another unit up at the second floor of Shaw House; a new space with a dedicated dining area that is no longer shared with Caveau Bar like how it used to. The new space also serves up a wider variety of tarts, few pastries and cakes as well.

⚘\n<br />Am glad they removed the dusting of sugar coating this time round and that the cherries bear a glossy sheen once more. Crust was buttery and crunchy as usual; the dessert perked instantly.\n<br />⚘\n<br />#dessert #dessertgram #dessertporn #instadesserts #dessertlover #instasweets #tart #fruit #fruittart #cherries #cherry #tarte #tartebycherylkoh #thearcticstar #teabreak #afternoontea #pastry #pastries #whati8today #sweettooth #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burrple

Both are vanilla cream base. Its nice but its pretty not worthy for the amount u paid for. Maybe its was cuz of the quality fresh and sweet fruits used.
Dark chocolate and cherry tart.
I loved the texture of this tart - a mixture of plump juiciness and crunch, flavors complementing each other beautifully.

If this happens to be in season, which it is right now, GET IT. You\'ll never find a curd so luscious and tangy, and a tart base so consistently satisfying. I dare say it\'s the best tart I\'ve had here!
Damn yummy but the price.. Ugh. I cannot.
Best tarts in SG
@tartebycherylkoh wows with juicy cherries, vanilla custard and that unmistakenably addictive tart base. Happy burpday, me! #foodporn #tartebycherylkoh #burpple

Definitely a bittersweet moment for me, this fine fine Sunday! \n<br />Crumbly tart with subtle butter flavours, light vanilla cream and suuuper plump juicy sweet cherries!
Creamy smooth velvety kaya on a bed of coconut frangipane with the toasted coconut flakes thats brings an extra fragrance to the well-made tart. 
Pretty colours brighten up the day.\n<br />Rare times like this to just sit around.\n<br />————\n<br />I love the crust here that is soft.\n<br />The fruits are seasonal.
That Harum Manis Mango Tart by @tartebycherylkoh with fragrant fat slices of mangoes, and great vanilla creme to tart base ratio making this morning complete. \n<br />#FTflats #mangotart
prolly soon. in fact it was my first time looking at it when @qiuuing brought it for tasting the other evening.

As always, the crust is perfectly executed. Firm, buttery, flaky and crumbly to the fork, the yuzu is a tad sweet but the blueberries tart knocks it out of the park. A nice balance of acidity and sweetness accentuated by the bursty nature of the berries makes this irresistible. As for the eclairs, they are good but perhaps overshadowed by the tarts somewhat :)\n<br />#tartebycherylkoh #tarts #yuzu #blueberries #sgcafe #sgfood #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #eclairs \n<br />A special thanks to @littlemissbento for the lovely surprise and really taking the time and effort to procure these lovely deserts!
// What\'s there not to love? - All but the hefty price tag of course。
A little pricey but oh so #delicious. \n<br />#foodie #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgcafe #cherylkoh #burpple #foodphotography #foodstyling
For all the stress and hard work, I think I deserve a sweet treat soon. Looking through the photos in my album, I think the most appropriate thing to post now is the seasonal Raspberry Lychee Tart ($8) from Tarte by Cheryl Koh. The fresh raspberries with the distinctive lychee flavoured filling and buttery pastry crust (that makes me think back to Chinese New Year goodies) is a sure-winner. Guess I will need to plan a trip down to Tarte soon.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping
I was spoilt for choice looking at the various tarts on display at the glass counter and without much hesitation, pointed at the Lemon Tart ($8). The lemon curd is sour and matches perfectly with the tartness from the pastry. This  rendition of lemon tart is definitely ranked as my top few choices, together with my other favourites such as Two Bakers and Kilo. However, both my girl and myself agreed that one other tart from Cheryl Koh stole the show. It was something that we did not expect to order or like but it totally crushed the competition. Stay tuned for it :)\n<br />|\n<br />For my list of key lime/lemon tarts recommendation, visit www.burpple.com/list/479570/for-all-things-key-lime\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

Yummilious
[Pistachio Tart S$9] so good that I bought tabao 1 for my gf before we leave.
I guess I will stick to fruits next time. I came back for Alphonso mango but it\'s not longer available 😭 #tart #cafesg #burpple #cafe #desserts #instafood #foodie #foodstagram #food
Cherry and lemon tart. Love their firm yet not too hard crust. Lemon sourness is just right and love the cream that is used for the cherry tart.
If tarts suits yiur fancy, this is the palace to go. Their tart crust is so delicately thin and is buttery. For variety they\'re filled with popular tart flavors and some available on a seasonal basis. I could easily finish one in a few... Tarte by Cheryl Koh, Shaw Centre, Singapore
Pretty amazing tarts
