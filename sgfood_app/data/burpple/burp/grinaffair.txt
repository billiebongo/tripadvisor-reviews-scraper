Seems like I\'m having a an affinity with jars. Anyway, it\'s great having Grin Affair nearer to central now!
A sister outlet of the original Grin Affair at Everton Park has opened its doors at Bishan, and it serves more than their signature cakes-in-jars. The Bishan outlet serves crisp and light meringue waffles made with only egg whites and soya milk, and you can choose from both sweet and savoury toppings. Go for the slow-roasted chicken waffle with bacon and maple cream ($7.50) if you\'re in the mood for something savoury, or the waffle topped with durian gelato, almond flakes and toffee sauce ($10) for a good sugar fix.
 The waffles tasted very old school and neighbourhoody (in a good way), while the tender chicken probably had a good midday swim in a hotdog brine pool before arriving. Bacon and maple were rather calefare-esque. 3.5/5
Not the usual egg or yeast based kind, this was meringue based.
Grin Affair\'s latest outlet in Bishan not only boasts a larger seating area, but also sees a wider variety in the menu from their signature jar cakes to serving waffles and coffee. Unlike the usual waffles elsewhere, Grin Affair uses meringue, soy milk and a dash of salt for their batter. The result; a crisp waffle on the exterior that is pretzel-like that tastes stronger of egg white, with a bit of soy flavour. Durian Gelato tasted a tad artificial, though pretty faultless in texture for its smoothness and the almonds add a good amount of nuttiness and crunch. Toffee sauce was overwhelmed by the durian gelato; could have been more generous actually.
Tried the sweet one with sorta cookie n cream gelato sprinkled with biscuit crumbs&amp; blueberry. I found it Abit hard for the waffles but it\'s chewy and i like the inner texture of the waffles. Another waffles spot for the people staying in bishan. Can try though! 😋😉
A bit too small maybe 😭 I\'m not a fan of the sponge cake because it\'s a bit dry and tastes kinda like chemical 😵 Fortunately, the mousse saves the day, being very creamy and full of tiny gritty hazelnut 😊 They seem to freeze the cakes and thaw them upon order since the middle part is still a bit frozen (yay ice cream 😆) Interior is quite nice but maybe the floor needs a bit of repairing. They are not packed with crowd and relatively quiet so can be conducive  for working, studying, or reading a book 🤔 No wifi, no power plug, no water.
Durian moussecake, $5.
Not very impressed with the cake. 😐

A dessert reminiscent of pushcart ice-cream served in a slice of rainbow bread, this slider packs a sweet punch💪🏻! 1 scoop of Salted caramel + 1 scoop of Butterscotch gelato resting on 2 browned marshmallows served on a lightly toasted soft bun dusted with icing sugar = Bliss ☁️🌈☁️😋 What a fantastic way to end a crazy Monday!\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />.\n<br />Side note: Gelato Slider was $1.90 with an option to add another scoop of gelato for $0.50. With 7 interesting flavours, I m sure no one would settle for just 1 scoop!!! Promo price for a limited time only (u.p. $4.90 😱). Catch it while you can!\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #grinaffair #sgfoodie #instafood #foodphotography #sgfoodlover #fooddiary #foodstagram #foodieat #sgfoodlover #foodie #foodlover  #burpplesg #sgcafe #foodporn #desserts #gelato #butterscotch #saltedcaramel #slider #marshmallows
🍦\n<br />Mmmmm the ice cream was pretty great but the waffle was a tad too soft for my liking. Overall still pretty delicious 😋
Can\'t wait!!! Anyway, can\'t believe this place is just across the road from @shooforthemoon\'s place?! 😝 | #igfood #sgig #igsg #sgfood #feedfeed #instasg #yummy #nom #jj_forum #foodforfoodies #foodspotting #foodporn #foodie #instafood #foodgasm #food #foodcoma #cafehoppingsg #iphonesia #burpple #cafe #sgfoodies #saturday #angelfoodcake #icecream #waffles #juice #igaddict #sgcafes #lunch
It is made up of healthy ingredients like soys &amp; egg whites. It has a very dense &amp; hard crispy texture to it,  very much like that of a pretzel. Very filling indeed. As for the #valhornachocolate #gelato , it has that punchy, dark bittery taste. It really belongs to the dark side. Lol!
But other than that, it another run-off-the-mills cappuccino as usual of a bakes focused cafe.  But gotta give some credits as it was pulled by such a young lady!
A rather unusual place to open an outlet... A very stark contrast to the other stores around there. When I was there most of the customers were kids and some teachers from the nearby schools. Very different feeling from the one at Everton. But the good thing is exact because of this, it\'s not crowded at all.
The waffles were super crispy on the outside but slightly dry on the inside. Although the waffles tasted pretty bland, the cookie crumble and maple syrup toppings more than made up for it. #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodiary #sgeats #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafoodie #instafood_sg #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #icecream
A tad too dry. And they served it with a wrong choice of ice cream. Forgive and forget?
The savoury touch from the marinated chicken breast and bacon coupled with the sweetness from the maple cream creates an epic harmony in your tastebuds. May the Force be with You.
Made using only egg white and beat up to a meringue consistency, the waffles is for people who like them crispy. The cafe stands by no artificial flavoring or colouring used which can be felt in the strong durian taste, as if you are eating the real fruit.
Accompanied by butterscotch sauce. yummy!!😋😋 #waffles #durianlovers #icecream #dessertlovers #dessert #sgblogger #burpple #openrice #tasteandflavors #grinaffair #bestfoods
