If you are a lover of \"exotic parts\" like I am, you\'ll \"tripe out\" on this brand new pasta at Spago. Pun completely intended üòÜ.\n<br />The al dente rigatoni is cooked in a beautifully seasoned tomato-based sauce, which the small, lightly chewy pieces of tripe and tender sweetbreads are completely saturated in as well. So even if you are the squeamish sort, let me assure you - this dish does not have any strong smell or taste. Instead, you\'ll be busy marveling at how flavourful and delicious it is.
Like falling autumn leaves settling on wintry ground, paper-thin shavings of marble-flecked black truffle blanket some of the best hand-cut agnolotti I‚Äôve tasted. Packed into these dainty pasta parcels are the flavours of fall ‚Äì intensely sweet late harvest Japanese white corn puree with a touch of mascarpone. Sauced with sage brown butter and a sprinkling of parmesan, this is luxurious comfort food that will stave the winter of anyone‚Äôs discontent, at least for the moment.
I love corn. And when it is in season, I stuff myself on it wherever the opportunity presents itself. This plate of black truffle-smothered, handmade agnolotti at Spago that I had last week, was filled with the last of it. The sweetness of the smooth corn pur√©e within those tender little parcels of pasta could make a grown man (and this grown woman) weep.\n<br />Pumpkin is the new seasonal filling for their agnolotti, and that\'s just been put on the menu. It\'s another delectable variant I can\'t wait to sink my teeth in.
What a riot of colour and taste on this beautifully plated Japanese vegetable zen garden of a dish. Thick wedges of sweet and juicy Japanese tomato are bedecked with sea lettuce sauteed with yuzu and soy, Japanese cucumber blossoms and spiralized sheets of cucumber. A luridly pink umeboshi vinaigrette made with white miso and yuzu provides a hit of citrusy punchiness, whilst scattered around the plate like sand is a little molecular magic ‚Äì miso powder made from the alchemical combination of miso oil and maltodextrin with crushed rice crackers for crunch.
There are many reasons why I always return to Spago at MBS. Leading the list is because every dish that leaves the kitchen helmed by Chef Greg Bess, is impeccably executed. Here is a glowing example, coupled with a healthy dose of creativity after his 2-week break of inspired brainstorming.\n<br />Lush and colourful, this salad is not only a sight to behold, but also a lyrical medley of many things Japanese on the tastebuds. The harmonious arrangement of the different kinds of tomatoes with Japanese sea lettuce saut√©ed in yuzu and soy, and crisp cucumber blossoms in an umeboshi vinaigrette dressing is both umami and refreshing. Lifting the vegetables with its light-as-air texture is the surprising miso \"soil\".\n<br />If you are at Spago for dinner, I highly recommend giving this appetiser a try. All of us who had it yesterday, haven\'t stopped singing praises about it.
An off-the-menu item that\'s only available by advance order, this is a game changer which impresses with a most unlikely combination that prompts one to question, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt anyone think of this sooner?‚Äù
The \"Mangrove Truffles Black Nut\" is a very unique delicacy by Chef de Cuisine Greg Bess of Spago Singapore. It combines the inky-black flesh dug out from the Indonesian \"buah keluak\" with the richness of foie gras to create an ultra smooth, thick creaminess that\'s piped back to fully fill the \"buah keluak\" shell and then smoothed over seamlessly. \n<br />This was my second time having it and I was still blown away. Describing the taste isn\'t straightforward but to me, it\'s like a cool, whipped thick foie gras cream with an undercurrent of earthiness. I haven\'t come across nothing quite like it and I mean that in the best possible way.\n<br />Served alongside is a tray of toasted slices of brioche. For those who prefer to savour their \"Mangrove Truffle\" with carbs, there is nothing more ideal.
I was told this is a must order for anyone\'s first time at Spago, and I can see why. Fresh and succulent cubes of raw tuna are dresssed in an unexpectedly harmonious blend of chilli aioli, soy, wasabi and miso that\'s   subtly spicy, salty, and imparts a rich mouthfeel. For texture, the fish is placed in sesame crusted cones, then topped with bonito, masago roe and shreds of scallion that layers on further depth of flavour to the already umami-laden appetiser.
The reputation of the Grilled Cheese Sandwich at Spago precedes itself and deservingly so. What a fabulous thing it is! The bread which is baked in-house, is studded with cranberries and walnuts. It is crunchy and light, yet sturdy enough to bear the weight of all that glorious ooey-gooey melted Fontina and Gruyere cheese. Layering on just the right touch of sweetness is Membrillo, a quince paste that\'s popular in Spain.\n<br />In my opinion, this sandwich is as spectacular as the sunset views from the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. So enjoying them simultaneously is even more special. This is made possible when you pop into Spago for their \"Sundowners\", the hours between 4pm and 7pm (Monday to Thursday). The good news is you can indulge in the sandwich for $14++ during this time (usual: $18++). And wash it down with a beer, wine or one of their wonderful cocktails priced very nicely at a flat fee of $10++, $14++ and $16++ respectively.
Farmer‚Äôs market yellow peaches, apricot compote, house made puff pastry, goat cheese ice cream
First of the season white corn, mascarpone, parmesan, sage-brown butter
Finally, I managed to get my hands on them yesterday evening. It\'s really, really good. Each order comes with four so go with a group of friends, order some drinks and share the calories. Believe me, they are worth it. Nestled between the cranberry walnut toast are melted Fontina, Gruyere and Membrillo. Yummy!
We ordered the truffle roasted chicken, fries, snapper in laksa sauce and a truffle mash potato came as a side. The mash potato was possibly the best I\'ve ever eaten- the truffle was infuse with just the right amount and the potatoes melted in my mouth. The laksa snapper was also filled with laksa noodles which was not very spicy but more sweet. The truffle roasted chicken had a thin layer of goat cheese underneath the skin which I feel takes an acquired taste to appreciate.
Chinese inspired steam fish in a western restaurant. Interesting. Or maybe food should be allowed to cross boundaries and not be confined by a particular cuisine
May our upcoming work week be as beautiful as this pretty dessert! Imagine our excitement seeing this.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />See how pastry chef @ailiong88 delicately balanced a meringue on top of a dome of vanilla ice cream decorated with edible flowers, then artistically laid some almond crumbles and blueberries on the side. The creamy ice cream, contrasted by the light crumbly meringue, is balanced by that little yellow done of calamansi sherbet. Take a little of each of these components altogether and enjoy the party in your mouth!
I had the crispy scale seabass ($52++) which they literally left the scales on, and seared to perfection. The fillet was lying on a bed of creamy mash with sweet corn, and was probably the nicest sea bass fillet I ever had.
My view that Spago serves one of the best value set lunches in town was reinforced when I visited the restaurant again last week.\n<br />The Steamed Red Snapper, my choice of main for the $45++ three-course meal, was downright impressive. Considering my selected appetiser was Wolfgang Puck\'s Signature Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones, an intensely flavourful creation, this could have easily paled in comparison. But nope, it more than held its own.\n<br />Resting on the \"bok choy\", lotus root, snap peas and \"choy sum\" was a boneless cut of red snapper which had me agog at its heft. What a bargain considering the price of the meal! And despite its XL chunkiness, it was steamed, Chinese-style, to perfection. The light, sweet soya sauce-base was indeed lovely and beautifully balanced, and there was more than enough spring onions, coriander and julienned ginger to keep me smiling, but ultimately, it came down to the freshness of the fish that\'d make or break the dish. Naturally, Spago passed with flying colours.\n<br />Served with a bowl of jasmine rice because that\'s what Chinese mums would do, this surpassed all my requirements for a truly satisfying lunch at fine-dining standard.
Favourite part of the meal!!! Portion was just right and the panna cotta was really creamy. Wasn\'t too sweet and was just right :-)
With Bok Choy, Choy Sum, Lotus Root, Sweet Soy, Lemongrass Scented Jasmin Rice
This portion was small as compared to the angus beef burger but was good nonetheless!
They went surprisingly well together. Very interesting dish. Dipping sauce complemented it very well.
The perfect mid week pick me up of The Botanist gin and refreshing floral hints of elderflower and lavender.
The iconic tuna cones are a must order! These delicate and crispy sesame miso cones of beautifully seasoned big eye tuna are packed with umami goodness of bonito, fish roe and a little dollop of spicy aioli. It is basically $6 a mouthful - but you totally get why once you bite into it.
Oh man this was delicious. The grilled fatty pork belly melted in your mouth and was coated in a sweet and salty gochujang aioli. It\'s unfortunate the plate was for sharing. ü§§ Comes with jicama and nashi pear kimchi on the side.
Opened by the same guys behind CUT by Wolfgang Puck, Spago too is top notch when it comes to their steaks. It is also a more affordable way to get a taste of CUT\'s standard of steaks, and in a less stuffy setting. Come by for lunch and get the Grilled USDA Prime Sirloin Steak ($62), which comes with handcut fries and a classic bearnaise sauce. Burpple Tastemaker Fiona Ting describes the meat to be pink and moist in the middle, and incredibly juicy thanks to the well distributed marbling. Add this to panoramic views of Marina Bay Sands\' infinity pool and the city skyline, and you\'ve got yourself a treat for both the palate and the eyes.\n<br />Avg Price: $70 per person (at lunch)\n<br />Photo by Burppler Shawn Dacookieman
üî∏\n<br />I really like the thin and smooth skin of the tortellini and the well-marinated beef cheeks that blends in completely in terms of texture with the mushroom duxelle. Pea tendrils and cabernet reduction are served alongside this pasta main course that\'s light on my palate. These are like little dumplings of happiness. Recommended!
This was my favourite item that day! üî∏\n<br />The raw tuna creamed by spicy aioli and topped with masago, shaved bonito and scallions is very much Japanese, but stuff all these into a crispy cone with a thin caramelized layer, it\'s now a European tapas.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is my recommended appetizer if you\'re lunching here.
The Angus Beef Burger was a very good burger, mentioned by my boyfriend. The beef patty is thick, has a robust meaty taste and pairs well with the buns baked in Spago\'s bakery. The generous portions of the handcut fries which comes is a huge bonus and we can\'t finish it. (Enough for 2 people to eat it on an empty stomach)
We began the meal with Wolfgang\'s signature Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones. These exquisite masterpieces were two crunchy sesame miso cones served in their very own ship. It is filled with fresh tuna poke marinated in spicy wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, splash of citrus and other garnishes such as bonito and scallions.
Chicken laksa roll
Pistachio Pana Cotta \n<br />This has got to be the most luxurious and delicate dessert I\'ve ever tried. Every detail in this dessert is so intricate and perfect. Full of flavours and interesting textures. It\'s a refreshing and mind blowing experience!
The grilled iberico pork chop is served medium well. The meat had a good taste but was a tad dry and bland. The gravy helped to relieve the dryness. It looked like a work of art.
This spring rolls is full of Vietnamese vibes with bits of vermicelli in it, more so when it is dipped into the Vietnamese fish sauce. Then, realize that there\'s actually delicate laksa sauce in it, complete with calamansi, coriander and laksa leaf, and it\'s also very much Singaporean. It\'s an interesting use of laksa in a spring roll!\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Thanks @gregabess for cooking up such a wonderful meal and @veronicaphua for arranging this lunch! #jiaklocal #springrolls #finedining #setlunch #vietnamesefood
At a recent lunch at Spago at MBS, I decided to have the Tagliatelle With Maine Lobster from the a la carte menu. It\'s a departure from my usual set lunch choice but I was very pleased to have tried something new. \n<br />The fresh, in-house made pasta was cooked al dente and had soaked in the flavours from the umami shellfish broth that was sweet from confit tomatoes and leeks. Rollicking around in the pasta were large chunks of bouncy, succulent lobster flesh - I love that it had been thoughtfully de-shelled for ease of eating. With saffron, garlic, parsley and chilli also used in the cooking, it\'s little wonder this boasts more flavour than your average pasta dish. Serving size was on the generous side as well.
We reacted to this beautifully plated dessert by Pastry Chef @ailiong88 the way any sane human being would - with exclamations of praise and plenty of camera action. And then we realised the best part of it was not actually visible.\n<br />Precisely crafted, the taste was what truly ruled. And clearly, the whole was greater than the sum of the parts because as delightful as each element was, their coming together in each mouthful showcased the dessert in the best light.\n<br />Allow me break it down for you.\n<br />Essentially this is Spago\'s interpretation of a calamansi vacherin. So there was zingy sorbet, domes of vanilla ice-cream on crunchy cookie base, almond crumble, blueberries and pristine crisp meringue.\n<br />What more can I say except that every meal I\'ve had at Spago has unerrringly ended on a high note.
These signature spicy tuna tartare in miso sesame cones practically explode with flavour. Which explains why they are a firm favourite of mine, and the thousands upon thousands of Spago\'s customers since Wolfgang Puck opened the very first Spago in California in 1982. \n<br />The original is a must-try in my opinion, but if you can\'t take spicy food, they can do a non-spicy version too. \n<br />And should you happen to visit Spago for lunch, you can choose to have them as a starter (they come in a pair) in the $45++ set menu. Excellent value considering it costs $36++ for a set of three cones if you order a la carte.
Awesome w pur√©e and caramelized asparagus üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The lunch express set is only at $45 with 3 courses. And the appetizer n deserts are amazing as well. Excellent service!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#grilledibericopork #spagosg #marinabaysands #myfab5 #sgfoodie #burpplesg
Pistachio Panna Cotta. Just seeing those words on the set lunch menu got me excited. The reality was even better.\n<br />As stuffed as I was by this point in our meal, there\'s no way I wouldn\'t clean up this magnificent mash-up of crunchy pistachio brittle and ultra-smooth, wobbly panna cotta. Not least because it\'s lit by the taste of sunshine from the orange gel√©e and orange gelato. All made in-house of course.
Soft and a little runny within, the large, plump pillow of creamy eggs comes stuffed with plenty of ham and field mushrooms, and showered in finely grated Gruyere. The accompanying roasted potatoes and fresh arugula struck all the right notes in rounding off this dish.\n<br />This is one of the main courses available in the $45++ daily set lunch at Spago.
Besides the fantastic value of the $45++ set lunch, Spago also offers an a la carte lunch menu that will have you wishing you had a bigger stomach and the entire afternoon off.\n<br />This Black Cod came highly recommended by our favourite server Catalin. Hence, it was imperative we ordered it. \n<br />The excellent quality of the cod fish was a given since this is Spago. Marinated in Japanese sake, honey and miso, the flesh came away in chunky, buttery-smooth flakes which practically melted in the mouth. \n<br />What really got us ooh-ing and aah-ing were the egg noodles. Like that mousy girl in a chorus who triggers a collective jaw-drop when she suddenly belts out a song all Aretha Franklinesque, the fine strands were astonishing. They exuded a refreshing citrus note from orange zest that complemented the sweetness of the cod wonderfully.\n<br />We also loved the silkiness layered on by the quail egg, and how the julienned cucumber, coriander and leek brought crispness and a fragrant spark to the dish.\n<br />Oh and by the way, this was a hefty portion. The huge plate just makes it look small üòÜ
A taste is but a tease of how immensely gratifying it would be to have the full-sized serving of this handmade tortellini all to myself. \n<br />Naughty, naughty chef üòè
The spring season heralds the arrival of some excellent produce, one of which is the white asparagus.\n<br />It was a life-changing moment when I ate it at Spago today. Before this, all the times I have had this vegetable had left me unimpressed. What\'s interesting is my dining companions @angelineongsuming and @happygreedyfoodie shared the same opinion.\n<br />Chef Greg presented his version of this delicate pearly vegetable with crayfish, a 63-degree quail egg, shavings of bonito-cured egg yolk and a rich sauce made from morel mushrooms and get this, crayfish liver.\n<br />Hand on my heart, it was insanely delicious.\n<br />If you are keen to try, you\'ll need to hustle because the season for white asparagus will end around mid April, if not sooner. Do note this is only available for dinner though.
If you want a more pocket-friendly Wolfgang Puck steak, then this is the way to go. The doneness was spot on as expected, and while I usually prefer the fattier rib-eye, this was pleasantly juicy with a bit of chew.\n<br />While the menus online indicate that it\'s served with rocket salad and B√©arnaise sauce, ours came with chermoula and compressed kohlrabi in addition to the mountain of fries on the side. No complains as it was absolutely delish!
This burger was so goood and massive, I decided to ditch the cutleries and use my hands. Fluffy house-baked brioche buns, super juicy patty (the juices will dribble down your hands! ü§§), aged cheddar, sweet onion marmalade, chilli aioli and the works ‚Äî it might seem simple and straightforward but this had all the right things you‚Äôd want in a burger. \n<br />Comes with a mountain of fries that is impossible to finish.
This has got to be the most luxurious version of a \"Burrata Salad\" I\'ve ever tried. Burrata domes with poached asparagus, asparagus puree, caviar atop French brioche and bonito-salt cured egg yolk. Then it\'s finished off with perfect tiny circles of black P√©rigord truffle on the asparagus pur√©e and a tiny bit of gold flake on the caviar. üòã Definitely a mouthful to to remember.\n<br />The burrata domes burst in your mouth, full of flavour‚Äîa very different texture from the usual creamy burrata. Every detail on this plating is so intricate and perfect. The art of food.\n<br />‚Äî Spago ‚Äî\n<br />Level 57, Sands Skypark Tower 2, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 018956\n<br />#SpagoSingapore

Never tasted Monkfish, never thought it\'d leave such a delightful impression. The typically overlooked bottom feeder, yet it textually mirrors the springy flesh of a lobster with tight and meaty flakes. \n<br />Served alongside nuggets of Maine Lobster, poached leeks, sweet rutabaga puree, tempura samphire, finished with a luscious tomato wine sauce. Delicate yet tastefully executed. \n<br />Up for grabs on Spago\'s  10-course dinner tasting menu @ 245bucks/pax. \n<br />#FTrecommends
There were so many things to love about the Chef‚Äôs Tasting Menu we enjoyed at Spago! The ambience and service was perfect. And the food was so good I went home and fell into a 15-hr food coma.\n<br />Let‚Äôs start with this Pan Roasted Monkfish. I‚Äôve had Monkfish a few times before, but it‚Äôs never stood out in my mind. Till last night, I think there‚Äôs a new benchmark for any Monkfish dish I have from now.\n<br />The flesh was so tender and alike that of plump lobster. Of course it didn‚Äôt hurt to have some lobster tail on the side too tossed in sauce Am√©ricaine. Braised leeks, tempura sea bean and streaks of rutabaga puree completed the delicious dish. \n<br />This was unanimously voted the favourite dish of the night. I liked it for the texture, flavour and it‚Äôs a very unique dish. A must try if you‚Äôre visiting Spago!\n<br />‚Äî Spago ‚Äî\n<br />Level 57, Sands Skypark Tower 2, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 018956\n<br />#SpagoSingapore
Acquired-tasting Buah Keluak, also known as the Peranakans\' prized gems of the swamps, infused into buttery Foie mousse then re-stuffed back into hollowed-out Buah Keluak shells.

There\'re very few things that are more exact a science than baking a souffl√©. And the ones that materialise from Spago Singapore\'s kitchen will surely take your breath away.\n<br />Pictured above is the Salted Caramel Souffl√© that brought our 10-course Chef\'s Tasting Menu dinner ($245++ per pax) to a rousing finale. \n<br />This beautifully orchestrated convergence of science and art was a sight to behold. I admired mine for all of five seconds before doing it the greatest justice of all - I dived in. \n<br />The immaculate souffl√© tasted incredible by itself but with the refreshing Farmer\'s Market Fuji apple sorbet and whipped cr√©me fra√Æche, there was more fun on the tastebuds!\n<br />In case you\'re wondering, this dessert is available a la carte too.
Unless it\'s Peking, I rarely pick duck.\n<br />This particular one from the 10-course Chef\'s Tasting Menu however, was a strongly persuasive thing. \n<br />Looking all come-hither in its glistening pinkness, it was decked out in pearls of honey-glazed turnips, flirty frills of cavolo nero (the kale used a lot in Italian cooking), creamy orange-kohlrabi pur√©e and shiny beads of black garlic coulis.\n<br />This beguiling sight gave way to full sensuousness of taste - one that left an indelible impression on me. Quite an achievement I\'d say. Bravo!
Only to be found lurking at the very bottom of the ocean, the monkfish is one ugly fella. But when you take a bite of it in this dish, the adage of beauty being skin deep never rang truer.\n<br />The succulent, bouncy flesh of the fish is very similar to lobster. You\'ll get to do a comparison yourself as there are pieces of the sweet crustacean from Maine included here.\n<br />In terms of the other elements on the plate, the Sauce Americaine and leeks were wonderful, but the gently sweet rutabaga pur√©e and super crunchy tempura sea beans were the ones I had serious hots for.
Last night, I encountered the most innovatively-prepared \"buah keluak\" yet: a brilliant union of the black nut with foie gras.\n<br />Dreamed up by Chef Greg after being inspired by the traditional way of mixing the flesh of the nut with minced pork, his cool, mousse-like creation triggered eyelid-flutters and soft gasps. And I\'m not just referring to myself as the source of them! üòÜAll of us at the table could be seen scraping just as madly at our nutshells to get out every bit of that light silk cream of earthy richness.\n<br />In conclusion, and in the words (or more accurately, word) of Burpple Tastemaker Fiona Ting, this was \"Genius\".
It is a wonder why Spago isn\'t packed everyday at lunch time. As Burppler Veronica Phua discovered, their Express Prix Fixe Menu ($45 for three courses) offers superb value for what they offer, and you get to enjoy the excellent cooking while taking in the view from the top of Marina Bay Sands. File this away for a lunch date to impress! Veronica is all praise for the \"audacious flavours\" of chef de cuisine Greg Bess\' chicken \"laksa\" fried spring rolls, which she insists you dunk in the accompanying lime dipping sauce. She also enjoyed the main of grilled Angus beef burger, thanks to its pillowy house-baked buns and the smokiness of the juicy meat. The generous portion of golden fries the burger comes with, really, is a bonus. The dessert of coconut-passionfruit trifle is fixed, but we\'re not complaining. Pro-tip: Ask your server for a complimentary self-park coupon when you spend $75 and above for lunch; limited to one ticket per table.\n<br />Avg price: $45 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua

What an incredible 3 course set lunch offered by Spago! It\'s a mystery why they\'re not packed to the brim with this special. Perhaps most people don\'t know about it. I had the big eye tuna tartare cones, grilled angus beef burger &amp; coconut-passion fruit trifle. Servings were generous and we all couldn\'t finish the fries that came with it. The tuna tartare was delicious and comes with a spicy wasabi kick, while the medium-rare beef patty was deliciously juicy. And you get to do all this at top of Marina Bay Sands. Here\'s a great way to give Spago a try!
The \"Traditional Kaiserschmarren\", Spago\'s signature dessert meant for two to share, is essentially a GIGANTIC SOUFFL√â. The biggest I\'ve seen in my life, to be honest.\n<br />When it was first presented in all its poufed up perfection, we couldn\'t help but gasp at its splendour. A plate with a neat arrangement of house-made strawberry ice-cream, toasted almond flakes and a heap of warm strawberries, was also set in front of us. Catalin, our amazing waiter from Romania (and I use the word \"amazing\" most sincerely because his service was beyond stellar) proceeded to scoop huge chunks of the souffl√© containing creme fraiche, rum and plump golden raisins onto our plates. Eating this dessert was like indulging in a piece of cloud that happened to be dressed in touches of earthly bounty.\n<br />As each Kaiserschmarren takes 16 minutes to rise in the oven, do note this dessert is only available at lunchtime as part of the restaurant\'s a la carte menu.
Discovering awesome value Set Lunches never fails to excite me! And I found one at Spago yesterday that was outstanding. Not only does it offer 3 stellar courses at $45++, but also a stunning ambience to relax in coupled with extremely refined service.\n<br />Aside from a fixed dessert (the pretty multi-layered creation of Coconut-Passionfruit Trifle), the Set Lunch menu lists three and five options for starters and mains respectively.\n<br />Yours truly zeroed in on the Grilled Angus Beef Burger (pictured above) for my main.\n<br />I left it to the chef for the done-ness of my patty, and he cooked it to an optimal \"medium\". The buns, baked downstairs in Spago\'s own bakery, were pillows of ideal firmness to support the thick patty of ground Angus beef. An appetising smokiness wafted from each bite of the meat, and trickled, did the juices.\n<br />It wasn\'t just the burger I found impressive. Proving just as splendid was the humongous serving of gorgeous golden fries (2 to 3 people could have easily shared it!). They boasted a crispness that lasted a long time. I learned this when I got my uneaten portion to take home in a doggy-bag üòÑ.
It must be something about sitting so high up in the sky. The food here, like this tasting portion of hand-cut Agnolotti with in-season Italian chestnut stuffing, is absolutely heavenly. Of course, the fresh shavings of French black truffle and port wine reduction with mascarpone and parmesan may have something to do with that too üòÑ.
The Harry Potter-esque skills of Spago\'s Chef de Cuisine Greg Bess sees the audacious flavours of his laksa (which I\'ve sworn eternal love for after having had his \"Pan Fried Red Snapper Laksa\") swaddled in shatteringly crispy spring roll form.\n<br />It\'s imperative to dunk these babies in the perky-with-calamansi-lime dip before you munch on them. Trust me, the two make some seriously sweet music together.
The sliders were juicy and tender. ($25) The cocktails were very beautiful. Total added up to $60-70. Right next to the pool, the restaurant had a nice breeze. Waiters were a bit pretentious though.
This is a refreshing salad with an Asian slant.\n<br />Composed of curls and folds of Granny Smith green apple, Japanese cucumber and Yali pear, it is served with artistically streaked yuzu-miso vinaigrette and multi-seeded crisps.\n<br />In Singapore\'s perennial warm and humid weather, it\'s an apt appetiser for any meal.
When an item has been on the menu of a world-famous restaurant for decades (something we learned from the waiter who served us tonight), you know it has to be darn good!\n<br />Each little crisp sesame seed-studded cone was packed with an extraordinary volume of flavour and surprisingly, some potent heat as well. This is because the cubes of tuna had been dressed in chilli aioli, soya sauce, wasabi, shaved bonito, scallions and masago (capelin roe). No wonder this appetiser has stood the test of time.
It takes balls to re-invent a dish revered by many but this Pan Fried Red Snapper \"Laksa\" at Spago proves Chef Greg Bess has pulled it off with aplomb.\n<br />Essentially, the traditional laksa has been deconstructed and married with new premium ingredients like the gigantic slab of crisp-skinned red snapper (line-caught from Malaysia) and chunks of incredibly sweet lobster, to create something that we Singaporeans might describe as \"same same but different\" and \"damn atas\".\n<br />The fragrant laksa gravy, served separately in a little jug, is mind-blowing. It whacks you over the head with a full-of-depth richness (despite not being overly thick) and a spicy heat that\'s fierce. Clipped short, the thick beehoon is served already dry-fried in the laksa paste. The dish is further enhanced by a heap of Thai basil and Vietnamese coriander, and presented with accompaniments of calamansi lime and house-made sambal. I\'d never think of adding lime to a classic laksa myself but in Spago\'s rendition, the sour citrus note was a prism - splitting the light beam of \"lemak\" into a kaleidoscope of deliciousness.\n<br />No wonder Gordon Ramsay couldn\'t help but praise it on an Instagram post earlier this year too!
Logic dictates that since Spago and CUT are opened by Wolfgang Puck, the steak at the former has to be of a certain standard since the latter is world-renowned for theirs.\n<br />True enough, the USDA Prime New York Sirloin was indeed tender and juicy, even without any fat marbling in sight. Not that the flavourful meat needed much else but the red wine reduction and smokey shallot pur√©e proved to be delicious accents. \n<br />What also set this apart from most steak dishes was its supremely graphic presentation, right down to the minimalist blocks of Comt√© bacon Yukon Gold potato terrine. Quite bold and eye-catching, don\'t you agree? üôå
Like the cut for its lack of fats, juicy and tender with a nice bite to it. Amazing how yummy it was despite being seasoned with only salt and pepper.
Loved the freeze dried oranges that were crispy and bursting with flavor!
Imagine fried dry laksa, laksa noodles and all stuffed into a spring roll. Definitely local. Definitely yummy.\n<br />Monster likey likey.\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #spago

Hearty Mediterranean salad with succulent grilled prawns, basil aioli, mesclun, braised baby artichokes (in white wine no less!), Kalamata olives, feta and pine nuts. We sure wiped this piece of flatware clean üòé\n<br />On a side note, breeze and view up here at Spago is truly spectacular!
Opened by the same guys behind CUT by Wolfgang Puck, steaks here are definitely top notch. Chargrilled with a broiler till it has that slight crunch but still pink, moist in the middle, and incredibly juicy from all that well distributed marbling. Accompanied with the classic butter-based Bearnaise sauce and a side of crisp hand cut fries. Better yet, the view of the infinity pool combined with the Singapore skyline; ideal place for an afternoon date! (Also! a good chance to get a taste of CUT\'s steaks that cost an average of $120-$250 at the restaurant)        #FTrecommends #marinabaysands 
Crisp spring rolls stuffed with the exact ingredients you\'d find in the local laksa with a side of tangy calamansi dip. The chu mi fen (thick white noodles) provided a nice texture and bite which I really enjoyed. You won\'t find any laksa gravy or lemak-ness here but an interesting starter nevertheless! Something I\'d order again when I dine in with friends from overseas!
I don\'t eat raw oyster. But must try for this one! You can\'t taste the rawness at all!
one of the best squid ink tagliolini ($48 for half portion and $70+ for full, i got the full.) i\'ve ever had. ingredients such as maine lobster, sweet shrimp, scallops, calamari were used and boy were they so fresh! (will review the rest of the dishes next time!)
Almost great view, if not for the haze. (skip the souffl√©, think there are better things there. LOL)
It was so good.
A treat!
This is definitely a must-order for me. It is available at the rooftop bar as bar bites as well as in the main dining hall as an appetiser.\n<br />*\n<br />It is amazing how Chef @gregabess manages to recreate the authentic taste and texture of the laksa in the filling of a spring roll. You can even taste the noodles inside. Such a creative twist to a local favourite. Truly delicious especially with the dip!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was another dish we were eyeing the last time we were here. We kept watching longingly as plate after plate of karaage was served to the respective tables.\n<br />*\n<br />Now we understand why it was so popular. Fried to a perfect crisp, the karaage was very tasty and addictive especially when dipped with the togarashi (Japanese chilli pepper) aioli.\n<br />*\n<br />Definitely worth ordering as beer bites. Costs $15 during the Sundowners promotion.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I had my eyes on this when we were last here. I had to restrain myself then because we were proceeding to the main dining hall for dinner. This time I made sure we ordered 2 portions!\n<br />*\n<br />Just as well I ordered 2 plates as it was soooo good. Toasted cranberry walnut bread with a mix of fontina and gruyere cheese and membrillo or quince paste. The result was an amazing combination of savoury and sweetness. We couldn\'t restrain ourselves to just one slice!\n<br />*\n<br />This costs $14 during the Sundowners promotion. Definitely a must order!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
We were back for drinks and bites, this time at the rooftop bar.\n<br />*\n<br />I ordered a cocktail called \'Show Me Love\' and he ordered \'Run Like Hell\' - and we are married??? Thankfully we were served a complimentary \'Love You Long Time\' to bring us back together üòÇüòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />Don\'t you just love the choice of names? My \'Show Me Love\' was a cocktail of Belvedere, St Germain, lychee and lime while his \'Run Like Hell\' was a blend of The Botanist Gin, elderflower and lavender. Thank you @spagosingapore for sending us \'Love You Long Time\', a lovely mix of vodka, tangerine and yuzu.\n<br />*\n<br />The rooftop bar is such a fantastic spot to have happy hour drinks (cocktail at $16, champagne/wine at $14 by the glass and lager/cider/ale at $10). Great vibes and an amazing view of the sunset. Drop by on Mondays to Thursdays at 4-7pm after work, which is exactly what we did!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

It was served in a rich and very tasty sauce of shellfish broth, tomato confit, leek, garlic saffron and even a hint of chilli. The lobster was cut into bite size pieces and were still firm to the bite while the tagliatelle, which is freshly made, was cooked al dente. Very well executed.\n<br />*\n<br />A point to note - Spago\'s portions are typically generous. I had the pasta as a main meal in a starter size and I still couldn\'t finish it.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Chef @gregabess surprised us with this dessert! It\'s as delectable as it looks! Earl grey mousse with nicely crunched up nuts and tangerines, chocolate and an orange gelato.

Garganelli with veal bolognese! I really savoured every mouthful. Full of flavour, hearty and the toasted almonds added the extra crunch to each bite!

I am not typically wow-ed by salads (I definitely prefer my meats üòú) but this was different. Combining it with chargrilled prawns, marinated tomatoes, feta cheese and herbs made the dish savoury and yummy.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Today\'s champagne was a Louis Roederer. Absolutely delicious. The wine tasted more mature but it still retained the youthfulness of a bubbly champagne. I loved it! Thanks Reynan for the nice gesture.\n<br />*\n<br />We ordered wine by he glass. You don\'t always get a good selection by the glass but Spago\'s list is pretty impressive. I had the Renato Ratti Marcenasco Barolo. It was a pour from a magnum! A magnum bottle is double the size of a standard bottle and is deemed a more optimum size for ageing wine.\n<br />*\n<br />According to Sommelier and Floor Manager Reynan, this wine may be taken off the selection by the glass üò•. It was such a steal. I hope it will be replaced by something just as spectacular. It was that good - elegant and full bodied with tastes of dark berries and a long finish.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
*\n<br />It is more commonly known as Buah Keluak, which is a fruit from a tall tree called Kepayang, native to the mangrove swamps in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. It has a very strong, distinct earthy flavour and is typically used in a very popular Peranakan curry.\n<br />*\n<br />Chef @gregabess combined it with foie gras mousse which was such a brilliant idea! The earthiness of the buah keluak blended so well with the rich and creamy foie gras. As Chef @gregabess said, you didn\'t know where the buah keluak ended and the foie gas began or vice versa. What you could taste was a mouthful made in heaven! Earthy, nutty, smooth, creamy were words which came to mind. I wanted more!\n<br />*\n<br />You can also spread it on brioche toast like pate. Just as delicious!\n<br />*\n<br />This can only be found in the Chef\'s Tasting Menu. I am now convinced I will have come back for just for that!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_spago #spagosingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The dining experience is so amazing here that I keep coming back with different friends.\n<br />*\n<br />Chef @gregabess surprised us with a teaser before we began our meal. I wouldn\'t have guessed what it was. It looked too beautiful and rustic to be eaten.\n<br />*\n<br />It was Buah Keluak! Simply delicious üòçüòç!

These exquisite masterpieces were two crunchy sesame miso cones served in their very own ship. It is filled with fresh tuna poke marinated in spicy wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, splash of citrus and other garnishes such as bonito and scallions.
I love salted caramel and I love souffl√©s so naturally this was my choice for dessert last Wednesday evening at Spago #souffle #saltedcaramel #desserts #sweetendings #spagosingapore #wolfgangpuck #singaporetoprestaurant #marinabaysands #latergram #sgig #sg #bscc_spagosg #burpple

Underneath the salmon is actually hijiki seaweed rice.

The patty was thick and done medium, hence, retaining its juiciness. The brioche was soft and toasted till it was crusty at the sides. So good!

The salmon mousse which was crowned with Spago\'s own house cured ikura was delicious. The bacon and mushroom en croute was equally yummy! We all thoroughly enjoyed it.

The crunchy pistachio nuts along with the fruits and ice cream contrasted and complemented the silky soft panna cotta. I actually finished every bit of it!

The cod was marinated in sake and it was done just right, as one would have expected! The star of the show for me were the egg noodles, tossed with a light refreshing orange chilli and black sesame vinaigrette. Totally unexpected flavours and it was the perfect partner for the cod, which was topped with a quail egg. It was so good that I can still remember the taste of the noodles and the cod #marriagemadeinheaven #blackcodmiso #favourite #spagosingapore #wolfgangpuck #marinabaysands #finedining #californiancuisine #japaneseinspired #sgig #sg #bscc_finediningsg #bscc_spagosg #burpple

I understand how some places require all parties in a table to order either all set menus or a la carte, but I love it when you‚Äôre given the option to choose freely! My dining companion and I wanted the burger (from the Prix Fixe Lunch Set Menu) and the steak (from the A La Carte Lunch Menu) so this flexibility worked out well for us.
Super moreish parcels of a dry version of laksa noodles with a tangy calamansi lime dip!
I may ask for a little serving of good Korean steamed rice to complete the meal. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Spago Bar, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodie #mychefstable #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #leica #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #feedfeed #goodeats #pork #buzzfeast #food #porkbelly #delicious #foodcoma #foodgram #forkyeah #foodphotography #koreanfood #dinner #instagram #burpple #kimchi #foodlover #indulge
