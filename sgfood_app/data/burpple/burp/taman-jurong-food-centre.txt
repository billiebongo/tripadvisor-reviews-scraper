Totally worth to travel all the way to west for this bowl of bak chor mee~!!!
Boyfriend came here for the famed lor mee but all the coolness of the afternoon\'s rain had worn off into humidity and lor mee no longer felt like a good choice. So I queued 25 minutes for the bcm and still there were 10 people ahead of me and I gave up. Sincerely, it smelt and looked and probably tasted damn good but I was bored and impatient. So I switched to curry.
Seriously guys, please support local desserts as much as you do your brunch and cafes. These stalls are disappearing and soursop\'s falling off the menu of those that remain. And hot bobochaha and the likes too, sigh.. Anyway, this was just a perfect ending to the spicy curry just before, mmm..
The salmon was not overly grilled and had a savoury type of sauce that goes well with it! The kombu is also very addictive to have for its taste, though it can\'t be said for the mashed potato, which is not as flavourful.
communal dining at its best. sometimes i heart heart the company i work at. my GM goes queuing for tien lai char siew and my finance director goes queuing for the famous four decades old hup soon porridge. and also they let me take food pics. haha
Prices are at $3/$3.50 for a plate.
This plate of food is at $4.50 (inclusive of a $0.50 top-up for nacho cheese) 
Came here to eat this again after so many years! Used to eat this most of the time after school üòÅ
Can\'t quite decide if it should be Happy Midweek of the new TGIW since tomorrow is a PH.
Also located on level 3, a huge plate of lamb rack for $7 with salad and fries sides. Asked for less fries because I was already quite full after the stingray. Very value for money and I think it tastes better than astons express. It was very popular and I had to wait 45 minutes for this. 
At level 3 of the food market, the Sambal crayfish was already sold out at 6pm! Shiok sambal stingray $12 and sambal kang kong $5, sweating like crazy from the spiciness of both dishes. 
My favourite BCM since young. I have been eating from this stall since I was young. It was always breakfast for the weekends! I rmb how my dad will bring me to the stall every weekend to queue for this. The stall has been passed down to the 3rd generation and surprisingly the taste has maintained. Fond memories of where I used to stay. This is to say, West side does have nice food!! This is the type which has no meatballs at all. It\'s super good when you add lots of black vinegar, and I love how sweet the soup is! One word: SHIOK üëç even though I\'m no longer staying in that area, I still travel back frequently for a good dose of BCM! üëçüëå#Hawkerpedia #oldschool #eatingthisfor19years
At $8.80 for the spread here, this Ngoh Hiang Prawn Cracker is definitely one of the nicer ones around! Fried items are tasty and fried to the correct amount of warmth! Mix it around with the chilli for a taste enhancement!

I have a really sweet friend who is very concerned whether I have enough food or not, after eating non-stop for the whole day. üòÇüòÇ Not a bad curry fish head btw!I dug the eye out and it went immediately into my tummy after this shot! üòçüòç
It\'s not bad but I kinda prefer the newton hawker centre version. Love how they gave the onions though! 
Really quite a lot of cheap and good food here.\n<br />.\n<br />üö©Taman Jurong Market &amp; Food Centre, 3 Yung Sheng Rd, Lakeside, Singapore 618499\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#mehmehfoodventure #mehlicious #foodie #foodblog #foodblogger #sgfood #foodsg #foodcoma #sambalsotong #sambalstingray #muttonsoup #sambalkangkong #hotplatetofu #yummylicious #foodinsing #eatmoresg #burpplesg #burpple #cheapandgood #worthit #affordable
Both $3.50. The noodles were on point the right amount of char and found on the #02, chicken rice was OK and up the top.

Chicken was pre-fried but holds its crispness well &amp; tender on the inside. üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />It\'ll be a notch better if it\'s Fried upon order.

We were in for a treat when we stepped into Taman Jurong Hawker Centre, where you see long strings of queues being formed at popular stores &amp; hidden gems in other corners. \n<br />One of the stand out dishes were the Soya Sauce Chicken with Roasted Pork Belly! With meat so soft &amp; tender, and a perfectly roasted skin, the soy Sauce Chicken can definitely be comparable &amp; said to be one of the better ones I‚Äôve tried! \n<br />Another unique item would be the Nasi Briyani! You would usually think of briyani as the rice dish topped with a huge chicken thigh covered in curry, but their version was similar to Ayam Penyat, with crunchy flour bits which the chicken was deep fried in! Even after being fried, the chicken was juicy &amp; succulent! Best part, it‚Äôs only $3.50! Alternatively, you could opt for the Mutton version at $4! ‚Ä¢\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG

The dishes here are quite good, no wonder always Q-ing.  The fish cake, salted veggie and  braised intestine with pig skin is good.. Overall 8.5/10

One of my favourite local veggie dishes.\n
One of my favorite place for chilled cheese tarts. The cheese is not too strong, just nice, a dessert that feels light.
$3 per bowl. At level 2.

It\'s not their first time eating and definitely not their favourite (think pork liver, no fishball).\n<br />.\n<br />Taman Jurong\'s 58 BCM has been around for the longest time for as long as I can remember.  I must have been eating it for a min of 30 years.\n<br />.\n<br />At the site of this same hawker centre of present day, used to house a very dirty, dark and wet hawker centre.  At that time, 58 was already a very popular stall.  Mum would sometimes ask us to go tabao with a stainless steel container.  The people at the hawker centre knows us as the tailor\'s children.  We were quite \"famous\" then. üòÇ\n<br />.\n<br />At this age, having a hawker stall selling a portion for $2.50 with substantial amount of ingredients and still retaining the same old flavour, is super hard to find.  Mine is the $3 portion (bottom left with red chilli).\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #bahchormee #SGParentBloggers¬† #instafood #instafoodie #instagood¬† #sgigfoodies #foodporn #foodaddict #whati8today #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgigers #foodcoma #nomnomnomnom\n<br />#foodshare #instadaily #sgfoodunion #yummy #yumyum #tastyshoutouts #delicious #foodpics #foods\n<br />#hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #openricesg #sgmakandiaries
Not like your usual bbq stingrays, this place serves a generous chunk of the fish on a hot plate for just $13. The sambar chilli complements the dish well without being overly spicy. \n<br />If you\'re a westie, this is highly recommended! Even if u stay in the east, make the trip someday, you wouldn\'t regret it.

The gravy was flavourful to have but tends to be slightly saltish.
The char siew was sliced thinly but tasted not bad, while the wantons were rather average.
Notice there are lots of char edges. Super shiok!  #burpple #6splus #food #foodporn #yum #instafood #TagsForLikes #yummy #amazing #instagood #photooftheday #sweet #dinner #lunch #breakfast #fresh #tasty #foodie #delish #delicious #eating #foodpic #foodpics #eat #hungry #foodgasm #hot #foods

The first thing I noticed about the bowl of Lor Mee ($2.50/$3.00) is the generous amount of ingredients. I can spot many ingredients such as fish cake, egg, braised pork belly, ngo hiang, flaky fish meat. For the price, this is really value for money.
