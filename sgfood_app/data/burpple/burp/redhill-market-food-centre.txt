This is the stall with the famous chicken wings that our very own PM Lee queued 30mins for. Having tried, i must say that the chicken wings are really yummy! 
Finally finally finally got to try this after failing thrice! The stall had an electronic board stating that the wings were sold out (which confused so many people) but we persevered through while seeing people in front of us leaving the stall with huge bags of takeaways. It ended up about slightly over half an hour on a Friday night. Prices were very kind to the wallet! Bee hoon at $0.60, wings at $1.20, etc. Bee hoon was light tasting but big portioned. Wings were thoughtfully cut by the owner and are super delightfully crispy and juicy though not as flavorful. No doubt one of the better fried wings around, they\'re the most affordable but not the best I\'ve had. My personal favorite would still be the hidden gem in Marsiling! Closing time for 焱 is 10pm but they sold out by 8.45pm. 
PRICE: $3.50 \n<br />Bee hoon + 2 chicken wings + 1 luncheon meat 
Springy \'meatballs\' (blend of yellowtail fish, pork and dongcai) from Redhill Block 85 stall to accompany my meepok for breakfast this morning :)
Woke up craving for Fried Carrot Cake and I ended up having 2 plates. Fried Carrot Cake Wars: 富明 (left) vs 日夜香 (right). While bloggers rave abt 富明， the one with the queue is 日夜香. Both do their own Kueh, but I personally like 日夜香\'s version more. Mainly becuz I like my black version sweeter and 富明\'s is strangely quite salty. Plus 日夜香 wasn\'t stingy on their egg and chai poh. #friedcarrotcake #rehillhawkerctre #BrunchEats #Hawkerfood #friedcarrotcakewar #burpple
Maybe we\'re lucky, maybe the uncle is generous by nature. The bowl was full of meat, egg, and peanut. Porridge was surprisingly smooth, making a nice and savoury meal overall!
[#01-59] The queue\'s long, I picture-memoried this stall\'s unit number (hope I\'m not wrong)! I asked for off-the-menu XL $6 fishball mee pok, dry, chilli, with an extra dash of vinegar (that\'s the great part about Hawker Food). The sauce for the noodles is really different from the usual mee pok, and I suppose it is the fresh shallots (not fried!) that gave that special oomph! It\'s hard to describe, you just gotta try! The fishballs are springy and by handmade, they mustn\'t be perfectly round. But did I mention that the soup is slightly peppery? Quite a treat if you are someone who likes spices.

Tried the prime minister approved chicken wings. It is indeed special as the chicken wing is fried to perfection and would only make you crave for more. The beehoon sold here is very cheap at 60cents!! Chicken wing is sold at $1.20 per piece which the kind owner would cut the wings and drumlets. However i would prefer the beehoon to have a stronger taste. Strongly recommend this for fried chicken lovers!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I have been eating chicken rice for ages. no doubt this is a surprise. The chicken taste fat and tender. You can easily tear the chicken apart. Chicken rice is also good. Very fragrant. The soup is more bland. Can taste the garlic, onion that is embroiled into the soup. this is $3, super worth! The queue is decent. But it gets longer as the time goes.
I see meats like this, I think my hormones react
This brand of pancakes can be found in many food centers. The quality of pancakes across the many stalls is consistently good. Lots of peanuts can be found between the not-too-thick pastry. Yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 December 2
Handmade fishballs and cake that are really tops. Well mixed mee with very good sambal chilli sauce. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 September 24
Simple dish and it was rather good. This was from Yong Kee Roast stall.
But I must post this - 日夜香菜头粿 \n<br />Chunky carrot cake with tau geh 😋
Dinner at Redhill Market has always been good, from the leehsienloong made famous fried chicken wings to this hokkien mee. There was enough wok hei and plenty of ingredients in the noodle. Only if they can give more of the sambal :)
Crispy and juicy even after close to an hour, 焱 Chicken wings should be one of the best chicken wings I have ever tasted!   Neatly arranged and packed when brought in by my awesome colleague (who queued about half an hour), we couldn\'t resist the smell of those wings and they were gone within seconds!

you see that, you see that? thats what i\'m talking about - that caramelized burnt ends and almost transparent fat. if you sin, you sin the full works, no in-between. then pray hard that the hot green tea later works miracles.
The Prime Minister approved Chicken Wing. This stall shows that good food doesn\'t need to cost much to taste good #faithincheapfoodrestored
sometimes when i cannot afford to head to the $4mil char siew place, i make do with what is nearby to wreck my heart with some heart-stopping fattening char siew. red hill hawker is decent but i always insist on 半肥廋 cut. consistency seems to be a problem here though - good fattening parts on some days, bad tougher than usual on others.
When I first came to Singapore, I don\'t have any intention to try this particular dish cause I thought the noodle must be overcooked and inelastic from its surface, but this one has completely changed my mind- A fried hokkien mee stall located at Redhill market, its al dente and savory, and the ingredients inside the noodle are also complementary, especially the fried lard, added a strong touch of flavor for the noodle but not overwhelming. Overall, I would rating this noodle 4/5.
All-day economical bee hoon that was pretty damn good. 2 happy people fed for $7.90 and after 10 years the price of a plate of bee hoon remains unchanged at 60 cents. The bee hoon was cooked perfectly and I doused it with the sweet and sour chilli sauce. And the chicken wings, oh the chicken wings were to die for. Super crisp and juicy omg so so good. You have to try this the next time you\'re here, look for the stall with the long queue. This really is a Singaporean hawker institution. \n<br />Clearly working my appetite this labour day. What about you?
Char Siew not too dry, and I love the sandy texture of the wonton. The gravy might be a bit too sweet for my taste. 
- can\'t believe I actually finished the journey lol. Anyways, last day but doesn\'t mean it\'s the happiest..my happiness today comes in the form of a bowl of #soup. Was really sick last night and today, I basically stayed in bed from 11pm-5pm today...nearly 24 hours LOL. Was shivering from fever and all but really thankful I actually recovered enough to get out of bed to have #dinner 😣
It\'s so good! Can\'t remember the stall\'s name but I do recommend this one(:
Sometimes all one needs is just some good warm Roti Prata - slightly charred and crispy on the outside, chewy and fluffy on the inside. Not too greasy, love this.
... even the \"bomb squad\" had to be on standby! 😜 Frills free, no fancy items on the menu - just good, honest, crispy roti prata. Be there early, sells out before noon.
Today it\'s dinner at 9.30pm and it\'s also the only meal I\'ve had the whole day 😅 the famous #redhillmarket #chickenwings...all good till my dining companion decides to buy some durian 😷

Normally I eat Black carrot cake with that sexy dark appeal, but today I feel like having it white! 
#breakfast ordered shui jiao Mian. It came w wanton and braised mushrooms.
it was not what I was looking for because I was craving for HK roast duck. Ever since I went to SG, I haven\'t found my HK duck. but i have to commend this duck rice I ate for its tenderness. lean meat with the right amount of its own juice. Not too much condiments which is a good thing. you can actually taste the duck.
The hard working ducks at @soonkeeduckrice 👍 Look how they glitters! 😜
My last review for \"The Battle of Ducks\" 👊 goes out to this plate of duck rice from Heng Wang Braised Duck stall 01-22 at Redhill Market! I have never been crazy about Braised Duck, but today I\'ve tried 3 duck stalls at one go! They serve white rice instead of yam rice, the sauce is perfectly balanced between sweet and salty, and the duck meat at Heng Wang is tender and juicy. I have yet to try the 4th duck stall \"Seng Heng\" which I heard it is the real deal, and always sold out by 11am! 👍
There are at least four (4) braised duck stalls at Redhill Market &amp; Food Centre! 👊 Today is the battle of the Ducks, and I\'m trying out the third \"Heng Wang Braised Duck\" 01-22 stall! The Menu looks promising, as they serve my fave 菜尾 salted vegetables. 😋
Battle of Quack Noodles! 👊 Last week I had duck kway teow noodles from Soon Kee Duck Rice stall! And today I\'m trying out the \"Redhill Duck Rice\" stall 01-79 at Redhill Market! The braised duck is comparable to Soon Kee\'s but the soup is lighter, I prefer thicker and herbal taste! 😋
My Sunday Lunch 😋 Braised Duck Kway Chap with compliments from @soonkeeduckrice 👍 Once again 谢谢你老板!
Soon Kee Duck Rice, one of my favorite duck rice stalls at Redhill Market &amp; Food Centre, because of the combination of their duck rice, noodles and kway chap! @soonkeeduckrice

Tasted this lala white bee hoon at 85 redhill food center! This plate cost $5.00 which include lalas, white cabbage and some garnish that goes along with the beehoon! I have to admit that the lalas are fresh and big! It was so chewy and tasty! Gravy and soup was super fragrant! It was quite well balanced in terms of the taste! Its sweet and savoury but more towards being oily! However, the soup was really good which enhances the taste of the beehoon! \n<br />.\n<br />Also they have slice fish, crayfish and lobster on their menus! All seems affordable in terms of the prices and quality! Its really worth the try!

今早我们到红山寻美食哦……\n<br />.\n<br />[swipe ⬅️ to see] There are so many yummy local food at Block 85 RedHill Hawker Center. Our choice this morning is fried carrot cake from FuMing (#01-49) the carrot is so smooth and soft\n<br />.\n<br />Teochew Satay Bee Hoon from Bak Kee (#01-42) also good. $3 per plate and it is full of ingredient, oh they even sold their Satay sauce separately at $2.80 per pack\n<br />.\n<br />#cuisineparadiseeatout #hawkerfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #burpple #chickenrice
at redhill market, facing the road.\n<br />#burpple #BurppleGotJio #wantonmee
It comes with beansprouts, kangkong, cockles, cuttlefish, tau pok, pork slices and liver drenched with thick satay sauce, there is also a strong nutty fragance and it\'s slightly spicy too. \n<br />The ingredients are cook at the right texture, most of the stall i been too they always overcook almost every ingredient. 9.5/10
Although the chilli and fishball is handmade but it tasted normal for me, instead the soup n fishcake is quite good. Mee pok is cook at the right texture too.. 6/10

------------------------------------------\n<br />Q for about 45mins on sunday and when it\'s my turn it\'s sold out 😭 so i went back again today at around 10am and it\'s nearly sold out. -------------------------------------------\n<br />The broth has been boiled 8hrs with a mild herbal taste but i would suggest not ordering the yellow noodles but rather kway teow cause the khee taste of the noodles slightly cover the broth. -------------------------------------------\n<br />The sauce has been been braised for more than 10 years, the braised duck and egg is very flavourful and the duck itself is soft and chewy. 👍👍👍 -------------------------------------------\n<br />Opening hours: 9am till sold out\n<br />Closed on wed, thur, fri
The prawn soup deserves mentioning as well, being freshly sweet!
After seeing some post on this, I have to give it a shot. It is really one of tastiest carrot cake I have tried for a long time. The bigger chunks of kueh stand out visually from the rest of the commonly found carrot cakes out there and it has a nice coat of wok hei around it. The black version is not too sweet and it brings out the fried taste of the egg. Thankfully the queue wasn\'t long and the serving is generously large for $3.50. If you do see a short queue at this stall, just start queuing. You will have no regrets 😋

$2.50 cheap and satisfying dinner
Its officially my new favorite! The secret behind this delicacy is definitely its soup. The freshness from the coconut milk, the sweetness from the shrimp and the heat from the chili oil, all of these flavors mix together in a bowl, seems weird indeed, but turn out to be an irresistible dish you would never want to miss if you visit Singapore.
One is not enough. PM Lee was spotted queuing for it and it\'s easy to see why! Better than Ikea\'s IMO. Fried carrot cake was not too bad but v v v v oily and prawn mee was mediocre.\n<br />#puttingbackcaloriesafterexercising #foodsg #burpple #ilovelocalfood #noexplodingsiyiandpaul #chickenwings

A delicacy that one usually spends tons of money on. Well, for me that is. But this little buns tastes almost as good as the ones at DTF &amp; at a cheaper rate! You pay for the ambience &amp; service I guess. Priced at $4.50 for 10 pieces, I can eat this any day on its own! 😊

Hi IG friends! How\'ve you been? Sorry for the lack of posts lately - I\'ve been a little busier these days now that I\'ve started working part-time. I\'m currently at a night market in Redhill - better known as pasar malam in Malay  These are tea eggs, a common pasar malam staple! #pasar #pasarmalam #night #market #redhill #tea #egg #eggs #food #foodie #foodporn #foodpics #foodforfoodies #yum #yummy #sgig #sgfood #instasg #instafood #singapore
Mee Pok for a late dinner! #sgig #sgfood
