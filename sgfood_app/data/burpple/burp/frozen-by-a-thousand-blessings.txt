There is also a lot of toppings to add on, chargeable by weight. I add on fresh mango cubes and the popping mango pearls, which costs an additional $1.15.\n<br />|\n<br />Frozen By A Thousand Blessings\n<br />Address : Blk 126 Toa Payoh Lorong 2, #01-551, Singapore \n<br />Tel : 6529 8028\n<br />Open :\n<br />#PickatSG #Pickateer #YummyPin #8DaysEat #OpenRiceSG #InstaFood_SG #Burpple #SGIG #InstaSG #ExSGCafes #ExploreSingapore #TSLmakan #EatOutSG #PhotoMoolah #IGerSpotLight #SGFood #IGers #FoodPorn #Food #InstaFood #Singapore #SingaporeInsiders #SGFoodies #EatBookSG #WhereToEatSG
I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the toppings, which was a refreshing change from the usually dried out condiments at most soft serve establishments. Even better, the natural flavour is sweetened with stevia instead of sugar, so dig in guilt-free! 🙆💗💗💗 #natural #yogurt #froyo #froyodate #icecream #healthy
Can\'t stress how much I love the yogurt here ^^ #burpple
Good flavours. #tingzieeats #burpple @tangsher
Still one of my favouritest froyo in singapore. They use stevia(natural alt sweetener) to sweeten their froyos, making it less sinful and more healthy! (Although my choice of toppings was probably bad) Love their unique toppings like cheesecake and banana cake! A tad more expensive than other places, but a guilt free dessert moment is all worth it.
Frozen by a Thousand Blessings 😍 We tried the different flavours (except mango), and the coconut and pomegranate one are my fave! ☺️☺️ Organic and Healthy, what\'s not to love about this Melbourne Froyo! 😁😁
Decided I need something to cheer me up for this tough week I\'ve been having(though it\'s only tues). Popped by this new froyo chain from NZ, one of the most expensive froyos ard at $3.80/100g. I got green tea and mango soy topped w blueberries,strawberries, coconut flakes and green tea lava cake. I really love the two flavours. Rich and creamy without any added sugars for the green tea (one extra tick in my nutritionist books) and without dairy for the mango. I really love it but just a bit expensive 😫 I\'ll go back again when I have money to spare!
💕 6 different flavours available and lots of topping for choice! (So many that I didn\'t bother counting. 😂) Just look at my tubs of froyo! 😁 #oneisneverenough 🙊🙈
