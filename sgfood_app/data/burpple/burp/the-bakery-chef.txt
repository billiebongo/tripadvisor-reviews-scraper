Charcoal Honey Toast with Oozesome nutella lava ($10.80)! Top up soft serve for ($2). \n<br />As we bid farewell to their lava donut series, we welcome the newly launched shibuya toasts this April in nutella and salted egg flavours! Like their donuts, the much anticipated lava was smooth and runny, visually stunning and tastes great! If you\'re looking for something more savoury, a salted egg flavour will be your best bet.\n<br />In case you\'re wondering what\'s the charcoal all about, it solely helps your body to detox without altering the smell or taste of the food. Hope that helps when you decide what kind of bread to get when you\'re there. There\'s a mini guide at the counter and sample of the food to help with your decision making, other wise you can ask the staff\'s and they will be more than happy to help you! \n<br />Other than softserves, waffles and honey toasts, their cake offerings are absolutely amazing. Have a cake or two when you\'re there and it will suprise you how good they are.\n<br />Blk 161 Bukit Merah Central #01-3711, Singapore 150161\n<br />Mon - Thu : 1000 - 1900\n<br />Fri - Sat : 1000 - 2100\n<br />Sun : 1000 - 1900
Charcoal Shibuya Honey toast with nutella lava and soft serve ($12.80) or without soft serve ($10.80) [New] on the menu is this comforting ooze of nutella lava! They serve a variety of cakes too! \n<br />Do try them out!
Had my afternoon tea time here as I did my work. Had the salted egg donut which is a decent size– not too big nor small. The icing sugar atop the donut goes very well with the yolk filling inside. I would recommend it to be eaten while it\'s hot, letting the yolk filling flow out nicely when the donut is cut open since I did not eat it immediately upon served. Like mentioned earlier, the sweet icing goes very well with the savoury filling, so if anyone is craving for a sweet savoury, the Egg Yolk donut might just be it. The staff were very friendly and were cool with me charging my laptop using my plug. I had relaxing afternoon there and the area is very quite too, for a Sunday afternoon👍
Salted egg yolk 🍩 ($4.80) and going at ($12) for all 3 🍩 including chocolate and matcha flavours!So 😋 look at that ooze! Love it! They offer a variety of cakes as well ! Yummy
What attracted me to this place is a certain lollipop cheesecake [$7.20] and the photogenic sea salt ice cream [$4.50 pictured]. It\'s presentation is comparable to Sydney\'s Aqua S range of offerings. Go search about this place if you haven\'t heard of it!
It\'s really very pretty! Anyway I\'m flying off tonight and the next time I Instagram it will be from Tokyo! 🇯🇵
The cone is crisp but the soft serve lacks the richness of Gula Melaka. #TheBakeryChef #Burpple
A slice of heaven that is both pleasing to the eyes and to the tastebuds! The rich and creamy Chocolate indulgence cake packed a punch! ($10.90 for a HUGE SLICE) Extremely chocolatey and moist!
Sweetness is spot on and earl grey isn\'t overwhelming. They don\'t have the matcha today so couldnt try it 😭
Had been here without fail every month for the soft-serve because their flavours change monthly. This month\'s special is Earl Grey and Matcha flavours; both of which available to order individually or in a combined swirl. Personally felt that the Earl Grey felt a tad strong as it overpowered the bitter aroma of Matcha, while it sat atop slightly crisp and soft waffles that is drizzled with a choice of chocolate or maple syrup. It\'s always fun coming here because every month\'s flavours have a theme (this month is all about tea), which makes it all exciting for you never know what\'s coming up the following month.
In a quiet unassuming neighbourhood lies the famed Bakery Chef. Quaint cafe that was pretty packed for a weekday afternoon but despite the relentless crowd, service was pleasant &amp; cakes were regularly topped up! A pity we missed last month\'s Sea salt gula melaka but this lychee bandung was not bad. Great to beat the heat; creamy, soft and full of flavour. Best for those with a sweet tooth &amp; a heart on fire x. 
The soft serve flavours of The Bakery Chef for August. If you are one who loves light ice-cream flavours without the usual caramel, vanilla or chocolate combinations of flavour this is for you; the light Rose syrup flavour blends well with the refreshing lychee flavour that lifts up the soft serve. And even if you are craving for something sweet, the addition of Caramel Popcorn at $1.00 is more than sufficient with its crunch and thick coating of caramel.
Now that I\'ve tried both, I\'ll still choose Med\'s rainbow cake over this. It\'s just a personal preference on the taste and texture of the cake :) •
Was around the area so decided to check this out because I\'m always up for cakes! The cakes were beautiful but thought the slices look rather small :x Lollipop cheesecake ($7.30) had a slightly crumbly texture but tasted like a decent cheesecake to me! And Bandung&amp;Lychee softserve ($4.50) really adds on to the celebratory mood of our Jubilee this month! :D
Lollipop Cheesecake ($7.20) and Kalamansi Sunrise ($5.80), both delicious. Too bad the soft serve was not available 😢
Here I am with my 2nd dessert for the month. Its a Bandung &amp; Vanilla Soft Serve, which is also the cafe\'s Aug\'s special flavor. The Bandung taste so good! 😄😋
Texture is light &amp; dense though the lemon zest could be stronger. 🌈🍰 |\n<br />Saddened to find out that their soft serve machine closes 2 hours before closing, after making a trip down. 😕 #thebakerychef
What\'s so special about this post is that \"JULY SPECIAL\" has ended! Hahaha! So hopefully the photo ease your thirst and here I introduce the soft served sea salt and gula melaka ice cream. It used to serve with cotton candy surrounding it, but too bad, the candy is run out of stock. But the caramel balls taste crunchy and yummy! Not sure what\'s the coming month specialties but looking forward for more ice cream as the cakes did not satisfy me much 😁
Of course I must go try since its a July special flavor &amp; the month is coming to an end. The blue is so sweet &amp; beautiful!! 😄
Definitely Instagram-worthy and tasted really good too.

Not only it looked pretty and Instagram-worthy, it  tasted good as well. The sweetness from the Gula Melaka and saltiness hint from the Sea Sat blended in well together and loved the creamy and smooth texture.
A taste of Sydney right here in sunny Singapore. Localized version of the legendary bi-coloured soft-serve with fluffy cotton candy!
ain\'t the ring of cotton candy huge?!? even more excited when they added magic pop onto the candy floss ($1 add on). simply fancy the sizzling sound in my mouth as they dissolve. \n<br />combination was both sweet and savoury, though it was towards a salty aftertaste. gula melaka did not predominate the taste surprisingly, giving a good balance of sweetness. though I am not sure how does it fare as compared to Aqua S, I am pretty happy to see similar items available in SG! \n<br />anyway, I like to lick from the top, then the side and spiral to the bottom. how do u lick ur soft serve? 😂
I can\'t have AquaS for now, when everyone else I know is in Sydney enjoying it ! This will have to do until my next trip down under.
It\'s pretty amazing to see how cafes in Singapore are upping the game by bringing concepts that have been done overseas to local shores. The soft serve surprisingly lasted quite long without melting too drastically and the combination was perfect with the sea salt adding enough savoury flavours to the palm sugar taste. A pretty good way to cool down in this current crazy heatwave!
Caramel Guilt, Calamansi Sunrise, Matcha Bliss and Chocolate Rainbow - $5.80 each and they were all worth it. My favorite was the chocolate rainbow not because it looked pretty, but because it tasted GOOD. Many rainbow cakes I find usually taste mediocre, but this was smooth and the chocolate buttercream made it even more delicious. The matcha and caramel cakes have a surprise filling inside; go try it and check it out yourself!
Loved that their sponge is so soft and fluffy! And their layers are so pastel colored , it enhances the overall outlook of the cake.
Thanks to the bf for constantly being willing to travel all around SG to get delicious food to feed my picky and choosy tummy and taste bud! Hehehe! And because of this I\'m getting more and more picky! 😁😁😁 Rainbow cake looks super chio but it is the matcha cake at the back that blew my mind! 😭😭😭
First things first, HOW CUTE IS THAT! Waffles were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Adding the cotton candy on to the ice-cream and pairing it with the waffle was actually quite good. Another pleasant surprise was the green base of the cotton candy tree - a yummy, moist and rich chocolate cake! 
I bought this small little piece of cake that cost $5.80 as a brunch today. The taste of the cake is so wonderful that i can eat it again and again. It\'s not so sweet and the chocolate taste is so strong. Will definitely return back again for their cakes 
I\'ll call #thebakerychef and the Chamber of Secrets 🌠🎩 caramel for caramel and red bean for #matcha
It\'s gonna be chocolate 🙋 since the texture and composition are much better. Anyway, the weekend will soon be kicking in! 👯👒
Cos I was just plain greedy and too lazy to visit the main shop 😜
Chanced upon this cafe when out for meeting and realized that the Bukit Merah Central area is fast becoming a hipster spot with 3 cafes in close proximity. Decided on The Bakery Chef and ordered a flat white ($4) to accompany me while I do some work. Shall come back one day for their wide array and colorful looking cakes.
Consist of 3 cakes available at counter, one standard glass dessert, one cupcake, and two macrons.                          Rainbow Cakes and Red Velvet were not overpowering and not too \"heavy\". Macrons were nicely done: not too soft or sugary. The dessert in the glass was made of a refreshing fruit (tastes like jackfruit). The carrot cake was the only one that tasted heavy, but it was good.
This is a slice of sunrise we had yesterday.\n<br />❢CALAMANSI SUNRISE S$5.80❢
Early birthday treat for the sista so it\'s sweets again! •
Freshly baked Rainbow Cake by a quaint bakery in Bukit Merah Central. Every layer of the colourful cake embodies a unique flvour. 
I love their chocolate cakes! Their rainbow cake is also a popular item. 🍰🍓 A busy weekend for me~ had to work this morning and tmr is a whole day of bento demonstration and appointments. Since I can\'t cafe hop this week, here\'s a #latergram of my visit to @thebakerychef \n<br />Oh yes, they serve matcha latte too! Yay! 🍵💕
One of my favourites from the cakes tasting I did at work last week, this good-looking confection isn\'t just sugary sweet and layers of colouring – it\'s super moist with a subtle flavour of passionfruit that keeps it interesting and refreshing. 
carrot cake was really good! moist and full of walnuts, love it! #sgfood
After I took my first bite, it was surprised how soft the tall cake was, yet staying in shape. \n<br />Pasted on the door was my review. http://danielfooddiary.com/2014/04/23/carrotcake
Have been searching around for rainbow cakes for a friend\'s birthday and read a lot of good reviews about the bakery chef. there\'s something happy about the bright colorful layers of cake stacked together. Taste wise, they often fall short to their deceptively beautiful appearance as a simple butter cake with cream. That aside, the rainbow cakes from bakery chef are one of the prettier ones I\'ve tried, cream was light and surprisingly not very sweet. I could swear that the individual layers tasted differently (due to coloring?), overall not too bad, I would say but am still on the hunt of the best rainbow cake in town! 
It\'s hard to ignore this as you browse through the cake display looking for something to order. This comes in original vs. chocolate, ordered the latter to go with an Earl Grey tea, not too sweet and hits the right spot. I like it.

Finally a marriage of colours bursting in the mouth. But sadly not a colourful taste
Pretty 🌈 cake 😍, really nice &amp; light too, not cloyingly sweet &amp; tastes like passion fruit 
Highly recommended to try out this cake you ever happen to be here.
Fluffy waffles that satisfies mummy\'s taste buds and a cute panda for a happy midweek! 
High &amp; light meringue torched just right. Sadly, the trust is a tad bit too thick &amp; makes it quite hard to cut down the center. Other than that, everything else was just right! 
Served in a pan, the Apple Caramel Pancake is easy on the palate as it does not come covered in excessive amounts of caramel, but instead, having light amounts drizzled on the top. The caramelised apples were fresh and soft, with a complimenting vanilla ice-cream which was smooth. Hidden beneath is the cakey pancake which is best to be had with all the condiments smeared atop.
Colourful layers hidden under a cream frosting. The Rainbow Cakes here have a different taste with each layer, some sweet and some slightly tart, invoking different flavours. Loved the moist consistency of the cake which made it so easy to have.
Creamy w/ a lil\' sour in the inside. Best matched with a cold mocha. The cafe is slightly crammed and noisy. But a good place to satisfy cravings.
Everyone started digging in before the picture was taken, they were just that good! Highly recommend the Calamansi Tart &amp; the Caramel Cream Puff, Red Velvet too if you\'re a fan of that.
Surprisingly delightful! Fragrant &amp; a good balance of sweet &amp; sour. 😍
The Bakery Chef offers quality bakes that are darn delicious and so very pretty. They offer dessert buffets every now and then — perfect for when you\'re feeling indulgent. The Chocolate Guanaja ($6) has an intense chocolate flavour, the Chocolate Praline ($6) is a crowd favourite, the gorgeously  moist Rainbow Cake ($5.80) sells out fast, and the Lollipop Cheesecake ($7.20) is always a hit. If you suffer from the pain of being indecisive, go for their dessert platter! Grab your friends along because good friends share calories, right?
Didnt really fancy the flavoured cake though it was really moist. 
First time a new cafe is opened at Bukit Merah Central. Ordered Flat White and The taste is great n not too bitter.
Having this Rainbow Slice will make you realize one is never enough.
Delightfully tasty with pretty presentation! But the small portion doesn\'t really justify the price | ★★★☆☆
Their bakes are pretty good but it was a pity they don\'t have their rainbow cakes anymore :( many people seems to be ordering their cakes from them so I think their niche area is really in their cakes. Coffee was too mild for my liking though.
Sending u, my friends a rainbow 🌈 cake is nice and moist! $5.80
Initially I was quite disappointed because it wasn\'t very photogenic, just a round globe and I could see my reflection in the shiny caramel coat. However, when I bit into it, it was very flavourful. The salted caramel was very distinct and I just love every bit of it!
It was pretty accidental to find this small seater cafe in the heart of Bukit Merah that serves a thankful variety of cakes, waffles and coffee too. As I had a heavy lunch only 5 mins before at the nearby hawker centre, I couldn\'t squeeze in more than two cakes and I wished I had. The Rainbow cake - Softly sponged and the amount of cream was just right. I am a fan of cakes and definitely a bigger fan in anything that tastes sweet. This Rainbow cake was a right balance and I am pretty sure you will rather have it all to yourself : ) Just look at the pretty colours! Unique right? : ) The other cake that wowed me was the Red Velvet cheesecake. After downing the Rainbow cake, I didn\'t feel a tinge of regret mouthing down the Red Velvet cheesecake right after. Love the right balance of creamy cheese and moist touch to it. Definitely worth to try and hey, the cakes are good to go for your breakfast the next day. They do take-aways too. I will be back. ; )
Dessert platter ($18.80): choice of three counter cakes, 1 cupcake, 2 macaroons, 1 glass dessert: chocolate guanaja, rainbow cake, salted caramel, carrot cupcake, blueberry macaroon, pistachio macaroon, tiramisu. All super delicious, but perhaps a tad sweet. This is a portion for 5-6 people after a lunch. Such a good deal and you get to sample so many desserts! Super attentive and friendly waitresses! Place is small hence super crowded whenever I pass by, whether day or night. Simple and nice wooden decor. Definitely worth a return visit! Highly recommended! 
Tried the opera cake and I really loved it. My friend tried the cheesecake, it was not bad either. 
Oreo chocolate truffle at just $5.50 a slice and it tastes awesome!
Totally awesome! The cream is piped in only when you order it and is so lusciously rich. Fantastic puff pastry too.
(r)
Where can u get a good one? This is about the best I have tried. #instavideo #selfie
Check out their other offerings! Tell me which appeals to you.
I want to have a good body, but not as much as I want dessert. Indulging myself with a slice of opera cake and a cup of coffee (not featured) under $10 dollar.
Pretty &amp; decent so it deserved another shot! [Praline Cake S$5.60]
Merry Christmas! Wish everyone had a sweet Christmas, as sweet as the Chocolate!

Taste great, worth to wait (only serve after 12). Great place for dessert lover.
The service were also a let down possibly due to the crowd.
A far cry from the performance of the buttery albeit plain-Jane appearances of the usual brioche
This is rather good after all. The sweet-salty balance right up my alley, next to the buttery crisp brioche with wispy spongy innards
Including THIS! \n<br />It\'s caramel.
Chiong down on the dot at 12pm if you wanna try this Matcha salted egg lava toast. Yummy, salty, greenish sauce~~~~ #noedit #naturallightingisdabest\n<br />Oh ya, they are on foodpanda too 😋😋😋

How about an #icecream cone to sweeten the deal? Came for their blue and white version but was surprised with their new red and blue edition currently going on now. \n<br />#Blue:sea salt \n<br />#Red: #bandung \n<br />Happily the saltiness and sweetness blend in very well together and was neutralised. Huge cone for just $4.50 is very worth the deal and best to share!

On a side note, the cotton candy melts way fast which cause a beautiful mess.
