Fried spring rolls as one of their signature dish to be known, as a regular customer that patronized Pho Stop for coming about 3 years now. Has got to know their dishes doesn\'t taste bad but it gets better and better somehow, I\'m amazed by it sometimes. Here\'s one you should totally try when you\'re at Pho Stop!
A traditional coffee in Vietnam, drip coffee is the common thing you see but not in Singapore. Strongly recommended for coffee lovers! The best coffee to have in town if you have not tried it üòÑ
It was actually beef ball pho but the restaurant was kind enough to let us have rice instead of pho. Though the beef ball looks ordinary and plain, the taste it gives is definitely comparable to those tender handmade beef balls. (Totally have no idea if the beef balls were actually handmade. Lol.)

Beef Feast Combo, if you are unsure of what to pick from the menu? Pick this if you\'re the first timer in Pho Stop. A bowl of goodness which never fails, it just gets better and better!\n
Noodles were nicely cooked. Serving of beef brisket and meatballs were outstanding. I just had to finish it even though my stomach was screwed cause it was so pho-king good!
One of my fav and i still think, their summer rolls is still the best. Given myself that had patronized them for coming about 3 years now. Never given myself a doubt about their food. Worth every single cents for what you paid for! ($6.00++)
Fish Cakes, this is purely one of the legend you should consider having when you\'re dining at Pho Stop. With the influence of viet culture, this is one of the secret recipe hiding behind it. No one knows, only to taste it! (P.S pardon the grainy photo, the lighting was pretty dark at the outdoor seat!) 
Healthy Goodness this afternoon. Love light lunches like this. #food #lunch #friday

Vietnamese milk coffee.  Honestly nothing as strong as the one\'s I had in Vietnam
A new edition of dry pho by Pho Stop with their signature marinated chicken chop. At their fusion tasting delights has left me speechless when I could not decide to have pho or their grills main, so this is one of the best combination to make up your choice of both! And it was so good that I wanted a second serving.
Hidden behind a dance studio in downtown, the broth was light and refreshing. Pho tasted generic but the beef ball was the killer; soft and flavourful ! Need more of that! üí™
üëÖ So Pho so good, it\'s gonna be the start of another new semester and year again! Dreading school? Fret not, with the upcoming fun and food-filled day (27 AUGUST), u can get to cure the pre Monday blue syndromes and rewind &amp; relax from the school workload!

We had their Pho Dac Biet ($13.50), which was filled with rib-eye slices, meatballs, rice noodles, and a variety of herbs. If you prefer it dry, try their Bun Ba Nurong ($11.50). With a giant chicken chop atop a large amount of noodles, this is a dish that‚Äôll let you get your money‚Äôs worth.\n<br />~\n<br />Full review at http://eatbook.sg/pho-stop/\n<br />~\n<br />Writer: @anintricatevein\n<br />Photographer: @mrseanfoo

Fantastic #grilledpork with noodles drenched in fish sauce! Yums! Totally hits the spot #vietfood #bunthitnuong #phostop #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #burpple #tanjongpagar #foodpic #foodporn #eatoutsg #sgcafe #cafehopping #barhopping
Comforting warm pho
Like having it as dinner after a big lunch~ 
I like this place for its hearty portions and delicious soups. Fuss free, it serves authentic Vietnam cuisine. Must try the fresh rolls and chicken wings too.
This is their Ch·∫£ Gi√≤ (literally minced pork sausage), a popular dish in Vietnamese cuisine usually served as an appetizer. It is ground meat, usually pork, wrapped in rice paper and deep-fried. üòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã [ Pho Stop\n<br />72 Tanjong Pagar Rd\n<br />Singapore 088493\n<br />6534 8178 ]
