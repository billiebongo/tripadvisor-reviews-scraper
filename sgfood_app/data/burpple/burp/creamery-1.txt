I immediately fell in love with this quaint botique dessert place. I love the aesthetics and ambiance of the place. It\'s a perfect spot to bring your date or your friend after eating brunch in one of the cafes around the area. We specifically went to this resto since I love cookies and I love lava cakes! So when i found out that they serve cookie lava desserts, I knew I had to try it. In fairness, their cookie lavas and their ice cream did not disappoint. One cookie lava is perfect to share. Their service is also topnotch since the friendly waitress will accomodate all your questions, and suggest the perfect cookie lava and ice cream pairing. I will definitely recommend this to my friends!
bought a coupon from qoo10 to get 2sets of this at just $9.90. loved this combination, the matcha lava oozes out as the waitress place the thai tea icecream on the cookie 😋
Red Devil ($8.90) is made of a chewy red velvet cookie with cream cheese lava center that oozes out when we drop a scoop of lychee sorbet (has bits of lychee fruits too!). Distinctive flavours that pair well together, we just can\'t get enough of the \"Devil\"\n<br />•\n<br />At a lost of how to pair? Just ask the friendly staff and they are more than willing to provide you some suggestions.\n<br />•\n<br />Creamery Boutique Ice Creams\n<br />Address: 139 Tyrwhitt Road #01-03, Singapore 207557\n<br />#CreamerySG
Red devil is a red velvet lava cookie, oozes cream cheese, yes it immediately make me compare this to a red velvet cupcake. No it taste different, the red velvet taste is significant, less buttery, cream cheese is more on the saltish (more cheesy side), which i prefer. Friendly staff recommend this to go with super baby milk ice cream, milo dinosaur was chosen instead, thou not the best combi, nonetheless, each is delicious on its own. Oh, thanks staff 4 being attentive to give us another 3 spoons to taste one another\'s dessert #sgfood #sgcafe #moltenlavacookie #sgdessert #burpple
.\n<br />Ending the day on a savoury sweet note as we sink out teeth into soft molten salted egg core to relief Monday frustrations.\n<br />.\n<br />The thing I like about their ice cream is that it\'s generally not too sweet and the friendly staffs would recommend pairing flavors to complement with lava cookie of choice.
.\n<br />Green with envy, with green cloth and green nails.\n<br />.\n<br />Not known to many, the originator of lava cookie from Bangkok has \'secretly\' set up a store in SG for awhile, selling their range of gushing molten core baked cookie with popular flavors such as red velvet, chocolate and of course matchaaaaa!
\"Not sure if it\'s a good idea...\" The server commented, but I went ahead. Why not, cos yolo. \n<br />Anyway, I think it kind of worked, the ice cream texture is the sticky sort. Need some getting used to. \n<br />The server was super hyper and made good recommendations. Makes the day. #saltedeggshiok
guys, this is really quite amazing. The matcha was fragrant yet not sweet, paired with an equally light tasting ice cream to go with the cookie. The best part, their customer service is 💯, which made the experience here even better! Go give it a try!
The lava cookie was rich in chocolate flowing out the moment the ice cream hit the cookie. The ice cream flavour was light and floral, complementing with the cookie well too.
Choc-A-Lot ($8.90) with Milo Dinosaur Icecream ($3.80 for a scoop)
Monster Matcha ($8.90) with Matcha and Thai Milk Tea Ice-cream ($3.80 for a single scoop, $6.20 for double scoops)
In frame: Secret Garden ice cream with Matcha Lava Cookie 🤤👅 from @creamery_sg [$8.90]\n<br />Super happy with my choice of ice cream that we had picked! Taste soooooo good! 😍\n<br />#ikidyounot I almost wanted to order another scoop of this!!!\n<br />I am definitely heading back again for it.
$9.90\n<br />Set comes with cookie and a scoop of ice cream of the flavor of your choice!
How about some dessert?
✨ Newly launched to the menu is this volcano cookie- charcoal cookie with salted egg lava ✨. I had this paired with salted white egg caramel which was a winning combination for fans of salted egg (which I am one✌🏻). Drizzled with caramel and topped off with sea salt flakes, the charcoal cookie erupted with a burst of golden yellow pool upon contact with the cold sphere - swipe to view! 😻 A standard 10-15 min was worthwhile for this soft, chewy and sufficiently moist cookie with a substantial filling. The salted egg lava was creamy albeit slightly grainy with a distinctive flavour; a pleasant lingering subtle salty aftertaste that was certainly a satisfaction for hardcore salted egg fans! ✨ Why 流沙包 when there\'s 流沙 cookie 🍪? 😉😋 The salted white egg caramel further enhanced the salted egg enjoyment with a luscious, milky and caramelised flavour that had a slight resemblance to salted egg- a milder and sweeter version. As for the complimentary scoop, I decided to opt for matcha (since earl grey was not available 😭). It was thick, creamy and milky with an earthy flavour that I would have preferred for it to be more distinct and less sweet (as a hardcore matchaholic). .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
😁 Overall it\'s good but #overrated. I would prefer my cookie to be of chewy texture like Subway\'s than crisp. Would I come all the way back here again? Maybe not, \'cos quite #ulu 😅 Thanks @xinyuelxy babe for accompanying me! 💖 #burpple
Looks classic and simple but the taste was a mind-blowing one, especially if you are a hardcore chocoholic! 💖 The brownie cookie was fudgy, gooey and sufficiently moist, with a luscious bittersweet chocolatey flavour. Coupled with a slightly crisp top surface layer, I was sold on my first bite! 😋 Do consume it while it\'s still hot for a better enjoyment! 😉 Pairing it with heart stop ice cream (brown butterscotch with chocolate cake chunks), the ice cream was smooth, creamy with a lingering caramelised flavour and fragrance that was pleasantly sweet with a subtle tinge of saltiness. The chocolate cake chunks embedded within were dense and fudgy, which no doubt pales in comparison to the brownie cookie. In fact, I enjoyed this brownie cookie much more than the matcha lava one!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smittenchoice
Only plopped onto the warm cookie upon serving, be prepared with that insta and boomerang-worthy sight (swipe once to view) 😻 as the molten lava explodes out from the cookie upon contact with the cold ice cream scoop. The cookie had a texture that I adore, soft, moist and chewy interior with a slightly crisp exterior. Best to have it while it\'s still hot and warm! The matcha lava was creamy and thick, with a subtle lingering earthy flavour that could have been more distinct. I had my set paired with eternal garden ice cream (made using tea from @1872clippertea ), a floral rose tea flavours that had a pleasant lingering floral fragrance, refreshing and aromatic indeed! Ice cream are all made in house, with unique flavours and funky names e.g. Piko piko, heart stop, black dog etc. Really really fancy the service here, with the friendly crew that took the effort to replace a whole new cookie lave set for me, upon witnessing the poor ice cream sweating miserably in the pan after I was done with taking photos😅. Thumbs up for the impeccable service 👍🏻👍🏻, with the creamery folks gladly and enthusiastically offering free samples of the ice cream and making recommendations prior to your purchases . .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Just look at it. How to resist?? The cookie was buttery and soft yet slightly crispy at the edges, and the lava was ooooooooh. Definitely worth the calories!
This is red velvet cookie with cream cheese lava and secret garden (eternal garden tea and charcoal) ice cream. #burpple #tingzieeats
Get hyped up because this it the new trend of eating your cookies. They fill it with chocolate lava, we smash it with the ice cream of our choice. It\'s gonna be a messy piece. All so sweet, flour-ish and love filled chocolate. Nyam!! Worth the try. (You can head down to Kook\'s Cremery @ Serangoon North as well! Because they\'re similar😁) follow me!~
@creamery_sg has up to 50 flavors of HOMEMADE ice cream, which are super shiok by the way, and 3 different variations of their lava cookies! Perfect for the CRAZY weather this Saturday.
Craved for something savoury sweet, so we ended up with the Red Velvet Cream Cheese Lava Cookie with Banoffee ice cream. The explosion of the thick and goey cream cheese filling (very generous amount) was a great surprise, and it paired well with the good sized buttery cookie that leaned towards the soft and moist kind of texture! Ice cream was decent and they\'ve quite a creative range to choose from. We liked that it wasn\'t as sweet as it looked but portion wise, it might be a tad small for 2 (ours was gone in just minutes).
The girls in the shop were the friendliest bunch. They made me felt welcomed and were very hospitable. I was able to ask for great recommendations and most importantly, the dessert was superb!!!!! 👌🏻🌟
cookie texture was off, but still makes for a good dessert cos the ice cream was good and the lava flowed 👌🏼
Stumbled upon this creamery that was just a few doors away from my Hostel (Fisher BnB) and decided to give it a try to wash away the bleagh tasted of salt bae-ed yuk gae jang from my mouth.
Piping hot cookie with matcha lava with your choice of ice cream is a simple dessert and yet so satisfying when the wait staff drops your scoop onto the cookie and you witness the contents oozing out. Toppings sprinkled when dish is served. For your sweet tooth. Choose the right flavour of ice cream to cut or balance out the sweetness.
🍴Just had to try this popular lava cookie cafe that came from Bangkok when I walked past it. A novel dessert idea &amp; mouth-watering just to look at that\'s def worth a try but maybe not the price. There was a lot of cream cheese oozing out of a soft and tasty cookie but it didn\'t quite pair well with our chosen earl grey ice cream (not sure which flavour would have tho haha). The ice cream wasn\'t as strong in flavour as I would have liked it to be but had a smooth yet chewy texture which I liked ⭐️ 3/5 ⭐️. .\n<br />📍@creamery_sg, 139 Tyrwhitt Road #01-03, S207557
Channel your inner child and imagine yourself walking through a crumbly-crunchy cookie forest with lush molten matcha greenery and a full ice cream moon hanging up in the sky - how great would that be!
Quite a new concept for the lava to be in cookie instead of cake.. Each lava set comes with a scoop of ice cream on every cookie ($8.90). Chose secret garden (tea infuse flavour) ice cream on the chocolate lava cookie and Be my Valentine (white choco with strawberry flavour) ice cream on matcha lava cookie... Felt that the taste of their ice cream was kind of light and could be improved.
I came across this and thought I needed a break :3
Had piko piko (tiramisu) with matcha lava cookies ($8.90). The first sg franchise outlet didnt not disappoint. Every corner is so cozy

Red velvet lava cookie with ice cream is very nice! Cookie is freshly baked after you order. The cream cheese filling was sourish &amp; nicely accompanied by dark chocolate ice cream. Some might find the dessert not sweet enough.
Which we all know, are usually overhyped simply cause they look good in pictures. I was seriously impressed with what I tasted of the 12 flavours they had on display, which in light of the 60 flavours they have on rotation, is really but a mere sampling. Looooove the Counter Strike that\'s really a combination of pistachio, caramel &amp; chocolate fudge, as well as the Piko Piko that\'s really tiramisu with coffee fudge, best enjoyed with coffee like in this affogato
.
Yummy lava cookies at ($8.90) here\'s a shot of red velvet cookie 🍪 and one with matcha lava 🍪!\n<br />Totally love the Thai tea sorbet with strong tea flavour! 😋
The molten lava cookie was thick &amp; gooey just the way we liked it, &amp; the warm explosion really contrasted well with the cold scoop of earl grey that we got. Indeed an awesome combination that deliver the distinctively pleasing natural bergamot flavour with matcha\'s smokey essence 💕\n<br />Also love all their in-house icecream flavours with real cool &amp; creative names! Expect to see out of the (icecream) box creations like Zombie Food, Black Dog, &amp; Calehoyo! Try them all &amp; I promise you\'ll experience many love-at-first-taste just in a few minutes! Psst.. I was guilt driven but it\'s okay 😂\n<br />First Bangkok, followed by Kuala Lumpur, &amp; then Johor Bahru, so glad we can now finally enjoy this in Singapore (thank you Chin Wan &amp; Derrick)!\n<br />📍Creamery Boutique Singapore\n<br />#01-03, 139 Tyrwhitt Road, Singapore 207557\n<br />Opening Hours: 11am – 9pm (Mon-Sun)
A must try for the sweet tooth! Love how this is freshly baked. Also, pika pika ice cream goes soooo well with this soft cookie.
💣 Though not as explosive as it turned out to be, the service here is a thumbs up that warrants more return visits! 👍 Patient and friendly crew that brightens up ur day! ✨ // Any fans of cookie our there? Stay tuned as we\'ll be launching something exciting and specially for u! 😉
They first made waves on Instagram with their outlet in JB, and now they\'ve finally landed on our shores! Creamery Boutique Ice Creams are known for their picture-perfect molten cookies which are easy on the eyes.
Taking over the previous shop space of Dose! at Tyrwhitt Road is Creamery; the same brand which serves Lava Cookies in Bangkok and Malaysia — this is their first franchise outlet in Singapore.
Match made in heaven. Matcha lava cookie with Thai milk tea sherbet. Yes please! 🙋‍♀️ Cookie had a nice soft semi-crumbly texture. Lava filling was appreciatively generous. Thai milk tea really complemented the matcha flavour. We couldn\'t stop at one. I love this dessert so much I want to have it every day! 😍
Already missing it!

@creamery_sg ice cream never disappoint! Try out their Christmas special and see how the lava oozes out from the cookie! If you’re going for the whisky lava, you may want to choose baby milk ice cream as it really complement well with  whisky!\n<br />.\n<br />#foodspotting #bonappetit #setheats #burpple  #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #8dayseat #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #beautifulcuisines #onthetable #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #myfab5 #singaporeinsiders #vscofood #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #exploresingapore #onthetable #foodstagram #openricesg

.\n<br />Also in frame, the Whisky Lava Cookie with Dark Chocolate Icecream ($10.90).

Tops with eggwhite on our salted egg icecream! You might like to consider going with other lighter icecream flavours if all saltedegg combi appears too rich and a tad overwhelming for you. Their icecreams are all handmade in-house with their secret garden charcoal icecream as my favourite.\n<br />.\n<br />#creamerysg #icecream #sgdesserts #saltedegg
Red velvet lava cookie with \"Super Baby Milk\" ice cream. 👍
Super smooth matcha and Thai milk tea ice cream crushing it on the volcano lava salted egg cookie 😍😍😍 best dessert ever!
Tried the Red Velvet Cream Cheese Lava Cookie with Piko Piko ice cream and the Charcoal Salted Egg Lava Cookie with Salted Egg ice cream at Creamery. Preferred the latter as the former was abit bland; those who do not like sweet things will probably like it though! Get it at a 40% discount!

The monster matcha lava cookie ooze a fair amount of matcha sauce (slightly to the sweet side for my liking), cookie reminisice the taste of digestive biscuit, texture is one more on a crumbly side, perfect for soaking up the sauce, paired w secret garden ice cream, good combi for a more refined taste. #afternoontea #sgdessert #sgcafe #sgfood #lavacookie #burpple

Wonderful little pizookie place. Great dessert place.
🤤 you can just get it at @creamery_sg, no need to imagine.
😼 @creamery_sg
Walked like hell &amp; sweaty AF when we reached here. The premises is small; a total of 21 seats. With 6 that were unoccupied, we still couldn\'t get a table.. There is a waiting time of 40 mins because Reservations. Oooookay. 
It is called \"piko piko\". A tiramisu with coffee fudge and kopiko hard candy which was broken into small little pieces and imbedded in piko piko. Sprinkled with cocoa powder.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Watching piko piko melt away,  sensuously gently flows, drips, slides daintily like a ballerina and engulfing the chocolate goodness. Coffee fudge was velvety with a subtle taste of coffee. It was warm. It was cold. It was rich and gooey. A perfect marriage in brownie heaven. A truly sweet amazing explosion on my palate. ◾◾\n<br />Are you drooling yet?? This swept me off my feet indeed.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Thank you Chin Wan @creamery_sg for this gorgeous treat. It was nice meeting you finally!! #brownies #icecream #foodporn #sgig #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgfollowers #sgbloggers #instafollowers #instagramaddict #tpasg #instafoodsg #igfollowers #nomnom #whati8today #citynomads #theordinarypatrons #discoverer #
