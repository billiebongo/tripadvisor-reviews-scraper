It consisted of banana cake chunks, walnuts, caramelised bananas, vanilla ice cream, all on top of a Belgian Waffle. I got a little \"gelat\" after a while because the toppings were really sweet, but I still found it tolerable. \n<br />Full review on my blog! http://foodwithnic.wordpress.com
Revelry is a cafe specialised in waffle mains, both sweet and savoury variants. Pictured: vanilla ice cream waffle with melted marshmallows and candy floss.
Would have preferred a slightly fluffier  waffle but still a great combination nonetheless! :) 
Could go for 3x as many meals &amp; snacks in between than usual. They call that \"emotional eating\" but honestly, I don\'t find it all that bad. It\'s life. #stresstalk
The provided maple syrup wasn\'t too over powering when drizzled over the chicken. The fragrance and the lingering texture of the chicken won me over :) Definitely one of my more favourite chicken and waffle combinations.
Too beautiful to eat . Lemon Curd, Toasted Marshmallows, Candy Floss, Ice cream ...
Signature Burffle ($18) tastes just like a hamburger, only better. With juicy beef patties, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and animal-style sauce in-between crispy waffles. Burger and waffles cravings satisfied! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Whenever I am ordering savoury waffles, I would go for a safer option such as the Chicken &amp; Waffles ($17), this dish looks so appealing! Fried chicken thigh was a tad too dry, but the light and airy waffles, fresh lettuce, tomatoes along with the drizzle of maple syrup pretty much made up for it! Yummy! üòã
The cotton candy floss and melted marshmallows are diabetic. Thankfully, it was balanced by the acidity from the lemon custard underneath. Decent waffles, but pretty average as a dessert. Would have much rather preferred the classic vanilla, caramelized banana and banana cake from the Monkey King waffles in the background. üôàüôäüòâ Rainbow cake was also pretty average.
they have very cosy shop layout, cool menu book, super catchy waffle names. Fly me to the Mars (choco+Mars choco) &amp; on cloud nine waffle (with lemon custard underneath ice cream, sprinkled with popping candy) cost $30 for both; find it quite pricey for the quality and topping.. will try their signature chicken waffle 1 day. #sgfood #burpple
Walking down along the way of beauty world, downtown line 2 and found out this cake which has wonderful Yuzu Cheesecake. The lemon taste is heavenly so nice and texture is so smooth
going bananas over these sweet caramelised banana waffles with ice cream and banana bread üòç (was a bit too sweet tho)
Fried chicken, waffle, and maple syrup, however at a more affordable price of $17! 
Original fluffy waffles with an air-like texture
While it was pretty decent, it wasn‚Äôt as impressive as I imagined - but that\'s just my personal opinion. I‚Äôd very much prefer a har cheong gai (prawn paste chicken) version of this that goes with some local chilli sauce than the original western form. Nevertheless, service was impeccable &amp; I was more than happy when told that we could get a free drink with every $15 spent (per table). &amp; Oh, did I mention free wifi üòè
So I was driving by my neighbourhood and happened to chance upon Revelry. Only a year old, but the place was packed like mad sia! Was feeling for a sugar fix so I ordered Fly Me To Mars, a Belgian waffles topped with torched mars bars, toasted marshmallows, crumble and vanilla ice cream. Everything was sweet. Very sweet. F*king sweet. Albeit too sweet for me. The Mars bars were sweet. Marshmallows sweet. Once you\'ve eaten that, the ice cream and waffle becomes tasteless mush in your mouth. But eaten by itself, the waffle is flavourful and the vanilla ice cream is just an added bonus to that flavour. Overall, nothing special. After eating, you\'ll confirm be super high from the sugar rush. IMHO, doesn\'t warrant a $15 price tag, but must try everything once in your life right? WOOHOO I THINK THE SUGARS JUST KICKED IN I NEED TO RUN FOR 100KM NOW KTHANKSBYE!
The waffle was crisp and airy with a slight burntness to it, and there was a distinct air of Sahara desert to the concept that neither the sweet and slightly sour lemon curd nor the vanilla ice cream could dispel. Elsewhere, the titular cloud, completely unable to be tackled with utensils, felt like a pretty hindrance and the toasted marshmallows ‚Äì the one enjoyable thing in the sea of elemental disparateness ‚Äì deflated wondrously into happy goo in your mouth. 3.1/5 
Light and crispy waffle with well-seasoned juicy chicken thigh (reminds me of the comforting har Cheong Kai)
Love this cutie waffle! Combination of sweet candy floss and sourness from the lemoncurd works perfect and it simply looks too beautiful to eat :)
Basic Waffle comes with butter and syrup at the side with a vanilla ice-cream over the top. The airy and yeasty waffles aren\'t my sort for its bland bread-like flavour, and the ice-cream was pretty mediocre as well.
I loved how crispy and fluffy the waffle was and also the cream sauce was pretty light. Definitely going back to try out their sweets waffle. #yummypin #burpple
who ever thought that these combinations are going well? especially otah and cheese? Its definitely superb!
Pretty decent waffles even though it was slightly airy. Moist inside yet crispy on the outer. It was just like any other staples in every cafe.
Tried their 2-in-1, which was a mix of cheesecake and thai milk tea. The thai milk tea flavour wasn\'t brought out very well, but thought it was refreshing for a change! Had their lattes as well, which was rather good. Love the decor the most though! It was quite spacious and had a mini garden in the open area behind the cafe too.
Revelry, based on its definition, is a lively and merry festivities when these involve drinking coffee and sharing waffles
Waffles (including waffles + deep fried chicken) should fall into the list.
that time for year is here again üòÅüòÅ this chicken and waffle at revelry was its own interpretation of de dish. I liked the generous portion of the crispy and juicy chicken. the waffles were airy, fluffy but a tad yeasty.
Waffle Pizza @ Revelry - Otah, Kailan &amp; melted cheese over a waffle.  Lovely and unexpected combination of flavors.
I don\'t want to sound mean cos I\'m all for enterprising F&amp;B enthusiasts with eager young staff, but there is only one way to break this down: this was terrible. The chicken was neither soggy nor crispy, more like a weird airy cross between the two, the meat itself bland and uninteresting. Meanwhile, the moisture from the salad seeps into the lacklustre waffle, which was notably undercooked ‚Äì there is a difference between \"soft and fluffy\" and \"soft and mushy\", and this was unfortunately the latter. I\'m really sorry, but there was absolutely nothing redeeming about this dish.

Which turned out looking a little scant, though, with overcooked eggs and limp bacon languishing over a bland waffle. üòï 
Popped by this new waffle-centric cafe for dinner yesterday and left unfortunately unimpressed. The best thing I had was probably the lemongrass mayo dip that came with the fries. 
Wohoo~ Featuring their On Cloud Nine waffle with Belgium waffle, lemon curd, cotton candy and ice cream! Not to mention their coffee using their LaMarzocco machine! #burpple
Newly opened in Lorong Kilat is Revelry, a chill and casual cafe specialising in savoury waffles. Tired of the usual ice cream pairings with waffles? Then this is just the place for you! Menu items include waffles topped with crispy fried chicken, eggs royale &amp; smoked salmon, prawn &amp; cheese, and even otah &amp; kai lan. They also offer a selection of cheesecakes cakes supplied by Cat and The Fiddle and serve coffee made with Allpress Espresso blends.
A newly opened cafe at Lorong Kilat that serves one of the most decent cup of coffee. Finally there\'s one much more closer to my home!
What\'s the plan after dinner? Or the night is still young for you? Craving for sweets or savory? Head down to Revelry to get those fixed. Have I mentioned that they serve waffles too? Do go along with their blends of coffee if you\'re in need of one! 
If you like your coffee strong, here is the place to be. 
It was my first to try a milo cheesecake. First or the only cafe (as far as I know) to create something unique. Milo though is not rare to find as an ingredient. It turned out to be so good. Topping it with the whipped cream was actually the owner\'s idea. She relayed that they used to snack on milo powder with whipped cream. So they recreated their childhood goodness into this unique creation. I\'d rather have this than any other cheesecakes not because I love milo but it was dang so good.
The battered fried chicken is quite tasteless on its own and with quite a noticeable salty taste. The chicken is quite succulent and not too dry. However the batter is quite thick and greasy. With drizzled maple syrup, it adds abit of sweetness to it. Waffle doesn\'t remain crispy for long and becomes soggy due to the amount of grease from the chicken
The eggs were ËõãÁÇíÈ•≠ (fried rice) eggs trying to masquerade as fancy, fluffy brunch eggs but were improperly costumed. The waffle struggled to leave an impression after my speed dating with waffles lately. But the serving was mucho generous! 3.5/5
Been looking for a place that does everything with Waffles? Try giving Revelry a visit, which does both savoury and sweet waffles. Their menu items are pretty quirky, from the now-common fried chicken with waffles to unheard versions such as Prawn &amp; Cheese for the savoury and sweet ones involving torched Mars bars. If waffles don\'t fancy you, you can also drop by for some cheesecakes that is being supplied by online bakery Cat and The Fiddle and a cuppa brewed from blends by Allpress Espresso from New Zealand. A spot that one can spend some time at while waiting for an empty seat at nearby Carpenter and Cook!
They serve savoury and sweet waffles here. Waffles Royale is a take on the classic all-day breakfast favourite; Eggs Royale atop a waffle. Their waffle has a light, fluffy batter that was blander in taste so that it actually goes better with the savoury flavours. Poached eggs were runny, though the Hollandaise sauce could be more flavourful. Still good if you are on the lookout for savoury waffles.
Just like many other caf√©s, Revelry outsources their cakes; this one is from online bakery Cat And The Fiddle. Milo powder tops the cheesecake layer, which tasted and felt similar to Milo Dinosaur. Beneath that is the cheesecake layer; light and had a consistency similar to mousse. Dab some whipping cream on the cake and it\'s as though you are having Iced Milo; pretty interesting!
Otah chunks with chopped kai lan with mozzarella cheese on the begin waffle. The waffle has a crispy and airy texture that lacks a taste. The mozerella cheese is rich and not overpowering and Otah is flavourful and rich but not overly spicy. The combination is pretty good because the otah is definitely the highlight of this dish.
The fries seemed to be rather similar to McDonald\'s offerings; just less greasy and salty. Accompanied with a lemongrass-infused mayo, which whiffs of lemongrass with each mouthful.
They use Allpress Espresso blends here that has Brazilian and Sumatran beans here. Detected chocolatey notes in the medium-bodied cuppa here.
The cheesecake was nicely mousse-y (which is rare for cheesecakes, who often value turgidity and taking over your stomach quickly) and mysteriously disappeared from the plate within two minutes. 4/5
Keep Calm and have a cup of Mocha ($5.50 nett)\n<br />.\n<br />Location: @revelry_sg 21 Lorong Kilat #01-02, Singapore 598123\n<br />.\n<br />#revelrysg #burpple #burpplesg

A special combination with chicken and waffle . Nice 
Monkey King. Caramelized banana w chunks of banana cake, topped with a big scoop of vanilla ice-cream. #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #waffles
Just plain Belgium waffle dusted with icing sugar. Maple syrup and butter are served separately so you can control the amount you want on your waffle. Texture of the waffle was good and boost a rich buttery taste. Would be awesome if they have more variety like charcoal or red velvet waffles. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #waffles #revelrysg

Currently in holiday mood smelling freedom already üòä Just have to pull through the 2 back-to-back papers tomorrow üí™üèª
The waffle here is crispy on the outside, and airy inside, with a nice ‚Äúsalted cracker‚Äù kind of taste (the kind that you have with cheese on top). The Otah (the ‚ÄúO‚Äù )and the cheese blends surpringly well, with the heat from the spice, neutralised by the creaminess of both the flavour coconut milk and the generous about of cheese. The topping is moist have the waffle a more oomph texture with each bite. The KaiLan (the ‚ÄúK‚Äù) added a refreshing crunch to each bite. One of the better savory waffles I have had so far.\n<br />-\n<br />Verdict: 4.2/5 (Bonus for creativity) Recommendation: Not sure how it will work out but the kailan can be crunchier. Perhaps deep fry the leaves of the Kailan as garnish (like some chinese restaurants do) to increase the variation of texture. ‚Äì I have not idea how it will turn out, it just sounds interesting in my brain.

It was very flavourful and appetizing! And their truffle fries were good too, they were pretty generous with the truffle oil.
I really love truffle &amp; fries but this looked nicer in photos than it tasted b\'cos.. /overcooked
Definitely a must try with the maple syrup :)
The folks at Revelry made that happen üòã #cafehoppingsg #revelrysg #revelry #ommmmnomnom #foodporn #eatoutsg #burpplesg #burpple
items mainly revolve around waffles. run of the mill, but it\'s a quiet venue with ample daylighting and feels spacious! would be good to chill here when carpenter &amp; cook next door is overcrowded
good hearty meal^^
damn shiok. The waffle is crispy and thin.
Oh those juicy chicken wereüëç
We explore the Lorong Kilat stretch with the newly opened Revelry and The Udder Pancake just a few doors down. Which do you prefer? üòÅ || this is the {Strawberry &amp; Cheese} waffle from @revelry_sg .

Their menu is centered around their light and fluffy Belgium waffles. Their chicken with waffles [$16] was surprisingly filling. They also offer light sides such as chicken wings [$8.50] and truffle fries [$7.50]. The coffee is priced reasonably at $4-$5.50. If you are thinking of a place to chill, here\'s your answer üëà Closed on Tuesdays. #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie #sgcafefood #sgfoodiary #cafehoppingsg #burpple #instafoodsg #revelrysg
