I love ‚ù§Ô∏è for wetter version of this local #hawkerfare ~so this plate of hokkien mee is good for me. *slurps* üëÖ
Flavour lacked the kick and noodles were overcooked too soggy. Their chilli was still good though. #burpple
Only open in the evening up to late night. Chilli is HOT. Noodles slightly above normal standard. üòã #sgfoodie #sgfood #sghawker #sgnomnom #sgfoodgasm #sgfoodporn #igsg #igsgfood #hokkienmee #burpple #burpplesg #supper #whampoa
