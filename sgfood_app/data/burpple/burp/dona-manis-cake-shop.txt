Old school, unpretentious, delicious, comforting. I hope you don\'t ever close Dona Manis 
If you happen to be at the Katong area, go and grab a slice of the Banana Pie ($2.20) from Donna Manis or maybe just get the entire pie instead! Donna Manis is an old-school bakery housed in Katong Shopping Centre and they usually sold out their pastries by mid afternoon. Many times I was there, I left dejected as they would have sold out most of their best selling items by then. Fortunately, this time round, I was able to get some before they closed shop for the day. The crust is buttery and flaky, and they are very generous with their banana filling, a perfect afternoon snack. Super thankful to the lovely and friendly couple who allowed me into their kitchen to take a shot of this wonderful freshly baked Banana Pie.
Yummy chocolate tart that oozes upon biting. But a tad overpriced if you ask me 
Humble looking banana pie at $2.50 each. It was a good mix of crunchy from the chopped nuts that were in the pie and sprinkled on the crust and sweetness from the banana. Would be good if nuts and banana were evenly distributed. But it\'s all good. Still yummy! Made fresh everyday. Will be back for more 
The best hidden gem around, and I am quite reluctant to share this. üò© hahaha!
The most ordinary looking bun but it taste so good. The filing is the slighty flowing kind at room temperature! So yummy!
Old-school bakery with absolutely divine baked goods. The chocolate tarts are insanely addictive!
I tell myself all I want is 2 slices BUT i always ended up buying the entire pie instead. Dang!! Sooooo delicious you\'ll want to share the calories and make your loved ones fat together! hahaaa #fatdiedontcare\n<br />.\n<br />#singaporeinsiders #exploringsingaporeeats #whati8today #love #yummy #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #onmytable #beautifulcuisines #burpple #donamanis #nikonsg #nikon5500
It blew my mind away. I always go to Katong for food research and never knew that in this humble bakery shop has such tarts. The bananas were soft and sweet, and the the texture of the crumbs and the crust was good as well. üòäüëç\n<br />#Donabananatart #donamantis #tarts #banana #katongshoppingcentre #jiakpahliao #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #bake #cakes #bakery #eatsg #burpple
I am absolutely in love with these unassuming chocolate tarts ($4.50 for a box of 5) that possess such a creamy and rich mousse-like filling (that isn\'t overly sweet) - they somehow bring back a sense of nostalgia, taking us back into those days when expensive artisanal tarts weren\'t all the rage. Best eaten out of the fridge, or even straight from the freezer (for an ice cream-like consistency omg?????!!!).
This little slice of cheesecake is on the pricier side considering the size for the price paid. It\'s best to consume asap as it melts really fast „Äã$3
Buttery crust is filled with real chunks of bananas and topped with crunchy nuts. Thank you my dear friends for this lovely BD cake. #yummy #love #onmytable #tslmakan #exploresingapore #sharefood #bananapie #donamanis #burpple

Creamy horn. 
Richness within.

WARM JUICY SLICES OF BANANA STACKED IN BETWEEN THE SUPER YUMMY CRUSTS at just $2.20 per slice. WHUT.
Sweet bananas with buttery crust. Yummy
Chilled chocolate cream in pastry. Hmmmmmmmm.
Expect a rich satisfying buttery pastry that crumbled in our mouths! Naturally sweet banana fillings complemented with fresh coconut shreds and cream topped with crunchy diced almonds, so good that it kept us as a patron for more than a decade! #makanhunt #makeyourcaloriescount #openricesg #food #foodies #foodphotography #foodphotography #instafood #instadaily #indulgence #bananapie #desserts #butter #fragrance #aroma #freshlybaked #sgig #igsg #shiok #yummy #pie #tart #banana #coconut #cream #musttry #sgfoodies #sgfooddiaries #sgfood #katong #mondayblues
