To round up dinner, homemade milk pudding, caramel flavour. Pretty decent, but can\'t compare to Paris Baguette or the one I had from the Hokkaido fair.
Roasted squid leg sushi and roasted duck breast sushi. My family\'s favourite, have to order it every time we are here.
Clam with butter and pepper. Popular dish and mum\'s loving it.
Eel with rice. They weren\'t kidding when they said it was going to be a mini rice. Think a scoop of ice cream. That small.
Udon in soup with pork. Udon was overcooked and it kept breaking apart as I was trying to pick it up. First disappointing item I had at Itacho 😢
The SALMON kakis!!!! We are going to eat you up! Hahahaha! #salmongang #fridayistooawesome #dinner
Lunch alone, just me and the fishes🍣🍱🍚 ($12.50++ for this lunch set of salmon, scallop, tuna, crabmeat and fish roe)
Very fresh, and tender meat. Taste awesome when dipped in sauce! 
If you don\'t really know what to order, here\'s a no brainer. Good assortment of quality sushi. Great value at $12.90
Somehow I don\'t feel the sushi \"kick\" after eating this. I need more salmon sashimi for my next visit! 
OMG it\'s that good. There is a reason why it is always sold-out that fast. Sweet meat of the crab stuffed right back with mushrooms and rice. 👍 
Avocado Tuna Salad with Cheese Roll 
Seared on the top. The blend of a thin crispy crust, the succulent meat combined with avocado tastes really good.
Every bite is a burst of flavor. Absolutely delicious.
Delicious!
Uni (sea urchin) mini don. My sis\'s @jessyeo, not my cup of tea.
Spicy minced pork mini don with a raw egg yolk in the middle. Mix it up!
Cha Shu in pork soup small udon. One of the best and softest udon ever! As good as the one I had in Hong Kong (yes the best udon I had so far was in Hong Kong). This is comparable. Soup is a bit diluted but still fine.
Fatty salmon sashimi :)
I think you can never go wrong with chawanmushi, but this was an especially good version! A generous heap of ikura is placed on top of the egg, and then drenched with nicely flavoured stock (albiet a tad too salty for my liking). BUT the thing that impressed me the most was how good the egg itself was, with its velvety smooth texture and equally delightful flavour.

Discounted prices at lunch! Decent sashimi but nothing remarkable..
Decent scallops but not fantastic 
Not the best I had and neither was it bad. Easy on the palate and the wallet!
.\n<br />They are having a Scallop Festival now and all the prices are slashed to $2.80 each! And it includes my favourite roasted red shrimps sushi too! A steal! .\n<br />Here is the roasted scallops with caviar and cod liver. Of course, these were the two that came first because we were so famished that we gobbled the rest of the sushi at first sight. The cod liver was a tad dry.\n<br />.\n<br />My all-time favourite is still garlic roasted scallops sushi! And for this season, they also have the roasted scallops with cod fish caviar (basically it is our mentaiko) and those were delish! Also had their flounder and yellowtail sashimi, countless of roasted salmon mentaiko sushi and other sides. .\n<br />Good meal to welcome midweek. .\n<br />Goodnight all! \n<br />#itacho #sushi #sgfood #sharefood #igsg #burpple #eatoutsg #instafoodsg #iweeklyfood
