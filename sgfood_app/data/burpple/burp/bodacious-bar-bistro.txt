Having previously tried their Grandma\'s Stew and Chicken Choux Crepe, settled for this Greek meatballs and was pleasantly surprised. The tangy tomato-based sauce makes a good dip with the soft brioche. The meatballs came in generous serving as well. For those working around Biopolis area, this is a great place to hang out after work, especially if you\'re looking for drinks and decent food.
Coffee &amp; Cravings members enjoyed this! I like how the burger fillings are layered to release a mix of different flavours. 
A mix of citrus and passionfruit. For my next visit. Heard it tasted good from everyone who tried it.
Good place to go to chill on a Sunday afternoon. Food not bad and reasonably priced.
it\'s hard to come by good pulled pork burgers in singapore. this one served at bodacious can be one of de better ones around but I feel it can be a little more juicy.
They were generous with the glorious cheese and chicken strips, but the sweetness of the too-thick crepe and balsamic vinaigrette threw the dish off tastewise. 
We tried all seven mains on the menu and this was one of the only two that passed our taste test: the skin was marvelously light and crispy, with tender flesh beneath. The garlic mashed potatoes, however, needed more seasoning. 
nothing great to shout about but worth a try. the fatty duck confit had a great skin flavour. the churros were rather well done. not bad for a cosy dinner at the heart of biopolis (the beers are relatively cheap 👍👍).
It\'s amazing how many places are unable to get churros right – these were way too crispy. 
☺️ And finally jetting off tomorrow morning! ✈️
Steam baked lean pork stripped and flavoured in a citrus spicy apple BBQ sauce on a base of tomato, cucumber and pickles served with fresh greens on the side with signature reduced balsamic vinaigrette.
Golden breadcrumb cumin spiced tofu patty flavoured in peach chutney served with fresh greens on the side with signature reduced balsamic vinaigrette.
Always a joy to meet this group of #foodies. To join us, you have to be up for any form of challenge &amp; take things to the extreme. hahaha! 😂😂

All 7 Mains on Bodacious\' menu. Take your pick! 
Golden breadcrumb cumin spiced tofu patty flavoured in peach chutney served with fresh greens in balsamic vinaigrette. 
\"Give us one of each on your menu, please!\"
Seafood stew with fresh mussels, sea bass, shrimps, in savoury chickpeas based broth served with toast. This wasn\'t any scrumptious as the menu describe it to be, my grandma could make better seafood stew than this. 
Ground beef wrapped in cheese melted corn tortilla flavored with spicy tomato salsa and enchiladas sauce. 
Steamed lean pork stripped and flavoured in citrus spicy apple bbq sauce on a base of tomato, cucumber, and pickles, served with fresh greens in balsamic vinaigrette. 
Country style duck confit served with garlic potato mash topped with tangy plum sauce. 
 Tender chicken strips wrapped in thin crepes sealed with melted cheese with fresh greens in balsamic vinaigrette. 
The tofu patty was quite good, I did like it. But the buns were a little dry and uninteresting, didn\'t quite \"gel\" together as a complete dish.
Mediterranean grilled sea bass served with chick peas and topped arugula. 
@Geraldine Tay called this burger FAT! I think she might have hurt its feelings...
No, this is not some crouching crab, hidden shellfish - just a duck leg confit trying to strike an artistic pose 😝 One of the better main dishes for the night.
This was the first item served, but failed to impress. Most of us found this pretty bland, and lacking in that wholesome rich seafood flavour.
Informal meetup with fellow ultra foodies, who are all die-hard Burpplers too! :) Check out everyone\'s dedication in getting the perfect shots. @Alain\'s props are getting increasingly pro! Lol.. he actually brought a handheld torchlight!!
It was great catching up with the Burpple tastemakers mob. Always brilliant and fun. This place is ideal for groups and meetings. Pulled pork burger can be more tender. 
I personally liked these, although they were a little too hard and crispy (causing the lack the soft fluffy insides), they had just the right level of sweetness for me, and didn\'t have that \"unfresh oil\" taste that churros tend to get. The bite-size servings are great for sharing (and chocolate dipping) too.
Nothing\'s too high, too wide, or too dark, for the perfect food shot! 😄 Any guesses who\'s the director??
Food was really just alright, not bad but nothing truly impressive. Prices are reasonable though, main courses between S$15 - S$20. I like the cool, dark, slightly eclectic, retro-chic decor. The service staff felt a little inexperienced, stiff.
This was another of the better dishes. Tender chicken strips folded into the chewy crepe, and topped with a cheesy coat and teriyaki sauce. Not bad at all.
Steam baked lean pork strips, flavored in citrus spicy apple BBQ sauce on top of tomato, cucumber and pickles sandwiched between two lightly butter toasted buns. Accompanied with fresh greens drizzled in their signature reduced balsamic vinaigrette. ($14.8) Crispy, fluffy churros doused generously with cinnamon and sugar ($8.8) - I prefer these to the highly raved Spanish doughnuts in orchard 😌😌 Latte ($4.2). They don\'t have gst just svc charge 😉
😉 Visit my blog  for my review of @bodaciousbistro! 🍴💖
Listen to your own voice, listen to yourself. And while doing so, sip a cuppa coffee. 😉☕
The Spanish fritters were crispy and doused with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar.
Serves decent all day breakfast menu fave such as French toast and Eggs Benedict. \n<br />Coffee on the other hand, could be stronger though it was double shot.
Bodacious offers all-day breakfast, burgers, and mains like duck confit and seafood stew. They\'re a pretty good contender for coffee as well. With Bodacious Bar &amp; Bistro\'s recent opening, Buona Vista seems like the next up and coming neighbourhood for cafes. Those whose offices are around the area will definitely rejoice. About time.
Fried Doughsticks that\'s sprinkled in lots of cinnamon and sugar; the way I like it to be without all the fancy and gimmicky chocolate dips. Really generous portion for $7.80+!
Bright cuppa which had a roasty yet acidic body. The staff here seemed clueless on the beans they used though.
Dipped in egg batter, these pan-fried toast were savoury and sweet with stewed apples stuffed in the middle, though the bread was not completely soaked with egg batter inside. Maple syrup is available at the side for those who prefer a sweeter touch. Berries on the side are sweet and fresh!
#burpple
Crispy skin, meat still relatively moist… all in all, 👍
The Short Review
Desserts are one of my BIG 💕💕💕! Chocolate fondant is the perfect combination of molten chocolate cakes with ice cream. The rich aroma of chocolate matched with the creamy vanilla ice cream is brilliant. It is also a new item in the restaurant and I personally would highly recommend it
Been coming back because they have really good food and peaceful dining environment. 💯✅ #MrYeong是個吃貨 #foodie #foodiegoals #foodaddiction #foodiesg #sgigfood #sgrestaurant #sgdineandwine #instapic #instafood #burpple #burpplesg #bodacious #sirloin #awesomeness

Yummy

They serve mains which are priced around $13-$20. If you are looking for something sweet, I would definitely recommend their churros [$8.80]. Plus, they also serve beer and wine at reasonable prices, if you are looking for something alcoholic. Closed on Saturdays. #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgcafe #instafoodsg #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodiary #burpple #bodacious
