The soufflé is slightly bitter, for those who love to eat dark chocolate, would love it. 
Laurent Chocolatier serves the richest chocolate pastries I\'ve had! It\'s one of the most outstanding chocolate bar in town that you should visit! A bite or two is never enough for sure, it definitely turns me into a fat boy when I\'m there for a visit and assured me the goodness of their chocolate cakes. Here\'s one: the Equator, I simply love the bottom crust of it!
This is as close as the pure organic chocolate you can have, it\'s like \"woah, a shot of chocolate bits went in your mouth during the first bite!\" I\'m not being exaggerating. But this is the closest I can express to you with words. I would say, chocolate is the best invention for sweet treats! This is one of the must try when you\'re here! Indeed a mouth watery experience 😍
Guanaja Chocolate Soufflé with vanilla sauce and raspberry sherbet. This was good! We waited 15 mins for it, polished it off in less than 3 mins. 😂 #chocolate #souffle #dessert
A bit over cooked. Would love more ooze. But my favourite chocolate ice cream with crunchy bits. 
Rum &amp; Raisin Soufflé... Food heARTs... #burpple #coffeeandcravings
Rum &amp; Raisin Soufflé... Mmm (๑´ڡ`๑) more food reviews on the way #coffeeandcravings #burpple
Mint &amp; chocolate chip soufflé served with chocolate sauce. $15++ 
Cake texture was fine but a little too sweet for my tooth. .... service was just so so not really up to standard
The cake has nice texture but a little too sweet for my tooth..... service there is a little not up to standard
Brownie wasn\'t bad but the coffees were not great. Particularly the iced coffee, it was far too watery. Home made caramel gelato was nice.
Yummy! Though we had to remember to mix it a bit or the liquor would be concentrated in one place... 
Rich and moist; adding the vanilla bean sauce was a big mistake. total drowned and overpowered the chocolatey taste. And definitely too sweet to my liking.
Whenever i think of quality chocolate cakes or desserts, this will be the one! Highly recommended for people who prefer dark chocolates as their desserts are not as sweet compared to others.. Nice and quiet ambience too! 
Had a Generous amt of chocolate sauce given, yet the chocolate MONSTER 😈 inside me was still trying to find bits of chocolate chips in the souffle, and was really thrilled n surprised with a layer of melted awesomeness (Choco chips) at e bottom😆this is definately chocolateyyy enough to satisfy someone like me 😸 wooos~~ somehow feel tt it\'s not losing out to the chocolate souffle hmm😻
This is a chocolate lover\'s heaven- a cosy and intimate cafe in Robertson Quay that serves to-die-for chocolate treats. From their famed souffle, to their tarts, hand-made ice cream and cakes, you\'re sure to find something that will satisfy. Although the souffle needs a baking time of 15- 30 minutes, remember that good things are always worth the wait.
Delicious soufflé for lunch, a little over-rated in my opinion... $21.19 
The inside which is messy but really chocolatey! Mint + chocolate + warm yummy soufflé. Sinful start to the weekends!
Anyone wants a dose of happiness?
still prefer the chocolate one ($18++). can\'t really taste the liquor in this , and it doesn\'t come w ice cream :(
Love the rich Valrhona chocolate and the raspberry gelato that comes with it. Intense flavours for a sweet ending. 
\"The best in Singapore!\" claim by @devilyne is definitely no hot air. This Grand Marnier Soufflé was a nice sweetened up the evening much to my waistline\'s grand protest. It\'s all her fault! | #food #foodgasm #instayum #instafood #instadessert #dessert #instaweekend
The chocolate soufflé was exceptionally good with the raspberry sherbet. Grand Marnier soufflé was rather disappointing though.
One of the best places for all things chocolate in Singapore.
Their bestseller and I can see why. Heavenly!
Didn\'t really enjoy this too much, a bit too bitter for my liking
Soft, fluffy and most importantly, the insides of the soufflé were still gooey when it came. The lemon was also not overly sour. Def a refreshing dessert to have after a big meal!
Very rich chocolate lava flowing out from the warm chocolate cake. But small amount of lava, which led to less brownie points for this overall. I HAVE to say it... The chocolate lava was HEAVENLY! Great dessert to end the night and head back home for a Saturday night movie. 
My #chocolatelavacake was nicely molten, paired with #tahiti #vanillaicecream and a dollop of #cream. His was the #trianon which is layers of dark yet rich #chocolatemousse and #hazelnutspongecake on a base of #hazelnutdacquoise #happylongweekend #idontsharemylavacake #dessertpartner @charliebakuteh #burpple

Wanna come back for the irish hot chocolate :)
That hazelnut crunch ($10.30++)
Both are superb but my friends and I agreed that hazelnut ice cream in lava cake is better than the vanilla in soufflé.
