My favourite part of the pork other than the belly, this jowl is tender while having some fats lining the interior, so I really love it. Or, if you love the texture of these pork cheeks as much as me, you could order the pork cheek quesadilla which is one of my favorites that evening!\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.

Sweet French Toast for $15. Can top up $1 for vanilla ice cream. It\'s a decent French toast, not anything I would make the trip specially for but wouldn\'t mind if I was in the area. I feel it\'s a bit expensive for what it\'s worth though. But maybe it\'s due to the target clientele being those living nearby in the landed property. Also tried the fish and chips ($17 I think) which can be topped up for truffle fries. It\'s a solid, standard fish and chips. But nothing special that would bring me back if I wasn\'t in the area. Ambience is nice and quaint and you can dine outside without melting from the heat. Service is rather laid-back though.

Here\'s a brunch treat for S$16 - Waffle Eggs Ben \n<br />with shredded braised lamb shank, mushroom, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. 
Remembered the burger was pretty good from this humble cafe. Seevice was good too.. Will probably take a visit to refresh my tastebuds. 👍🏽
Awesome french toast with generous serving of maple syrup. The savoury version came with bacon &amp; sausage which was a tad too meaty for my personal preference. Would have liked just 1 serving of either meat and perhaps a side of sautéed mushrooms or salad to balance out the meal. 
W39 is a great place for tea - $20 for 2 cakes and 2 drinks. I usually go for the apple crumble and ice cream but decided to branch out today. The peanut butter cake was moist, but the rainbow cake was disappointing. This is because the icing tastes like butter.....it took away from the overall taste, sadly. The coffee was good. Next time I\'ll go straight for the apple crumble! 
Gr8 place for brunch. Do try their rainbow cake and the eggs benedict (albeit their presentation can be improved)
So far this is the best rainbow cake I ever had. 
Tucked away in the streets of Jalan Mas Puteh, off West Coast Road. T\'was a pleasant little cafe to chill out. Baked Chilean Miso Seabass ($28) and Beef Tenderloin ($30). Seabass was fresh and baked perfectly. Quite a massive portion of mash potato that tasted authentic albeit slightly blend (but yay healthier¿). Steak was done a medium, and it was pretty good too. Definitely had our fill from this hearty meal!
This cafe definitely hit the spot to my tastebuds\' happiness with their wide selection of food and dessert choices at affordable prices. Be it their salad, pasta or main, we enjoyed our meals tremendously in their cosy casual setting. A hidden gem indeed. (For a full review, check out my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg)
It was a rather affordable set compared to other cafes. Huge and filling, love the eggs!
Quiet, cute, good coffee. A few outlets near the large table. Food is pricy though. Closed Mondays. 
Can\'t believe I travelled all the way to Clementi for this Wagyu Burger. But it was worth the try I\'d say?😋 (though kinda pricey💸)🙈
Enjoyable brunch, reasonably priced and a great atmosphere! Liked how lamb shank was used in place of the usual smoked salmon/ham. 
How I wish the weekends will just freeze for an eternity. Or maybe it\'s just my job that sucks
I was excited to visit w39 because I saw the iconic blue and yellow chairs in pictures online. Needless to say, the cafe was such a cute place - there were those colorful chairs, hipster decorations all around, bright simple patterns on the counter. What a gem! We had the cake set which was underwhelming (both the coffee and cake) but the Duck Confit is worth a mention, as it was tender, well marinated and almost addicting. Will be back to try the other mains, perhaps catch their weekday lunch set to be cost-conservative. 😝
$18.90 set lunch, comes with soup and drink. Guilt inducing creamy cheesy comfort food served with ham, mushroom with a hint of truffle taste. Not the best but ok, quite a large portion for me and I got sick of it halfway through so it\'d be good for sharing.
Eggs Benedict ($10) and Croque Madame ($12); affordable brunch prices but the taste of these dishes are questionable. AND ONE OF MY EGGS WAS NOT POACHED. Coffee was really bad too. \n<br />I RAN IN THE MORNING FOR THIS. I AM UPSET.
Biscuits cover with dark chocolate &amp; in between contains almonds. Good choice 
Rice was fragrant, chilli packed kick and chicken thigh was tender and juicy! 😋 and I finally made the trip to w39 after a long time!
Heard raving reviews about this bistro cum cafe, but what we ordered was really plain and dry. I could make such a toast on my own at home with the ingredients used! Felt really disappointed with this brunch item on New Year\'s Day. 
Here we have @w39bistro chocolate truffle log cakes to satisfy the craving! MERRY XMAS! 🎅
#TGIF My simple ensemble for a sick &amp; rainy Friday. Although they have pretty good lunch sets that are ard $20. I still went for the appetizer of seared tuna because together with roasted root veggies, it\'s just enough to fill my little stomach. Then a warm honey lemon to soothe my scratchy throat. ☔️
I love seared tuna! Those that I had in US are usually encrusted in black pepper. But at W39, it has soy glaze and wasabi mayo on it.(I don\'t normally eat mayo but am such a sucker for wasabi mayo!) It even comes with avocado salsa that surprisingly went quite well with the tuna!
W.39 serves both savoury and sweet plates, and the cafe seems to be pet friendly too if u\'re sitting outdoors. Nice place to chill. 
The decor of the place was pretty, and it feels as though you\'re living in your very own cottage. We only had desserts and Crispy Fries ($5) here but it was comfort food indeed.
Loved it for the tenderness and general good taste , though in honesty I\'ve to admit that Saveur\'s one is better.. Then again, Saveur is more geared to French cuisine while W39\'s more of a casual cafe concept so yep. 1 of my favorite cafes to date :) #whati8today
From far, you looked at this beautiful rainbow in colour sponge cake. It has a really lemony after taste which was really refreshing! This is a recommended item when you\'re here! And this was one of the reason why I\'m here too 😄
The goodness of this would be the overall, it taste like the freshly baked Oreo Cookie inside of it. This is a plus one for their cakes!
This is by far, the best apple crumble I had. Given the thickness of the apple crumble has shown no mercy on it\'s level. The sweet aftertaste was just right for an apple crumble! If you\'re a fan of one, try this!!

Doesn\'t it look so good with the shiny glow? Read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
Decided to run away from the office for a nice #TGIF lunch. Wasn\'t too hungry (or rather saving stomach for tea), so I decided to order their handmade crab cakes. It is chockfull of crab meat and perfectly fried, but served with a huge bowl of tartar sauce(which I eventually returned) the crab cake went very well with the chilli sauce! This is perfect when you don\'t feel too hungry!
Part of the lunch set that comes with soup or the day &amp; a drink, was disappointed when the dish came. As hot as the plate was, there wasn\'t anything oozing or melted cheese over the pasta. The best I have to say from this place was their playlist and interior. 
They are definitely very fluffy. Please read all about it at www.hungryghost.sg
It\'s not hearty enough for me, but then I am the Hungry Ghost. It should fill ordinary people quite well. Please read all about it at www.hungryghost.sg
the beef burger was sadly mediocre; patty was slightly dry and a bit flavorless. I can\'t remember the price but it was slightly pricey and not worth it 😢
This is a cake I enjoy very much cos it\'s made of my favourite ingredient - peanut butter. Yummidelicious!
Ever eaten cooked salad. This is my first and I like it. Break the pouched egg on top of the salad, mixed it well with the salad and you\'ve got a nice meal altogether. Very interesting. 
Lovely food. Nice place in a corner of a quiet neighbourhood. Value for money. Mister Chocolate Cake is disappointing, wonder what is the rave about?
Set lunch Mac n Cheese, Panfried salmon, and Confit of Duck Leg on dinner menu. 
• Red velvet cake \n<br />• $6.80 \n<br />• Pleasant tinge of lemon, smooth delight
The Raspberry Cake I ordered was yummy! The cream wasn\'t too much with a bit of sweetness of the cake. Ice milo was plain eventhough is W39 special.
All time favourite drink here at w39.
I would say their coffee is not that fantastic but if you\'re looking for a place to spend your laid back weekends. This is a place to consider.
Yummy Har Cheong Kai. 
An hidden gem located at the west side of Singapore. It gets pretty inaccessible if you don\'t know the location well. This is one of the place you should consider for brunch and definitely rooms are always available for good desserts!
Egg Ben for Easter Sunday. Yummy and at a uber affordable price of $10... Great deal!!👍👍👍
Gravy is a bit creamy kind not watered down. Spicy. And has poached egg one wor!
Seared tuna served with salmon roe, avocado cream and wasabi. $12.50
Sadly how colourful and beautiful, it\'s too buttery for my liking :(
Butter toasts with ham in between and sunny-side-up on top. Sunny side up was nicely done and toasts not too buttery. Worth the money. 
Happy Valentine Folks. Head down to @w39bistro for some 🌈rainbow cake!
super awesome with thick gravy, perfectly poached egg and just the right amount of sweetness, sourness and spicy-ness :D
Confit of duck leg with mash and salad. Yums. #burpple @thumberlinakoh @kurorui
As all rainbow cakes, pretty as pretty does. It\'s nice but too much buttercream for us (and we are not exactly health conscious people, with the exception of my sis). We actually removed the cream coating before diving into it.
Dinner with @yeojess and @alainlicious at W39. New dessert addition on the menu: peanut butter slice. Pretty good, peanut butter taste came though. However we all felt the peanut butter cream could be richer.
Back at W39 bistro today with my sister Jennifer, and gained another sister Jessica. We had a fun-filled evening of eat and laughters. \n<br />Presented right in front your eyes is W39 Bistro\'s Featured Cake of the Month, The \'Old-Fashioned\' Peanut Butter Cake. And at the back, an \"Impressive Showstopper\" with stunning colorful layers of rainbow sponge, The Rainbow Cake.
Braised pork cheek gruyere panini. The pork cheeks were tender and rather flavorful, and the meat balanced well with the crusty panini. I wouldn\'t mind if the greens can be replaced with chips or mashed potatoes.
The king crab leg salad wasn\'t photogenic on the black plate and lighting was quite a bitch. So I deconstructed the king crab leg and plated it myself on a white plate.
King crab leg salad with homemade mango salsa, trout roe, truffle oil and shiso leaves. Specially made a trip down to W39 Bistro for the succulent King Crab which were shipped in fresh from Norway.
and ending off with a rainbow cake!
confit of duck leg, mash, aragula salad
baked portobello mushroom, balsamic reduction
iced honey lemon
This is how Christmas should be spent! 🎄
with Roasted Tomatoes &amp; Balsamic Reduction. Crispy skin with juicy, tender meat. Served with salad and sweet tomatoes. Price: $15.90+
Rainbow cake. Package of 2cakes &amp; 2drink for $19. (Any choice) Cafe provides free WiFi :) Nice environment ) 
Meh latte using highlander beans. Their panini sandwiches fare way better.
Food is slightly salty but it goes well with the plain side. Set lunch includes the main and soup.
A little expensive (S$3.90), but the milo mix is really thick and sweet, just right for my taste! 
Red Velvet Cake! 50% discount for cakes and pastries from 5-7pm. Since it was on offer, we keep an extra storage for more desserts.
Red velvet cake. Current promotion of $4.80 (U.P $6.80). We got the last piece. This cake is so photogenic, perfectly symmetrical.
Mister Chocolate cake! And yes it is called \"Mr Chocolate\"! Highly recommended by the lovely folks at W39 and we actually fall in love with it! So soft, moist an chocolatey!
Wagyu Beefy Burg! 🍔 One of the signatures on the menu.
Steak and Fries 
Steak (Medium) and Fries! 🐮
Wagyu Beef Burger and Shoestring Fries for dinner!
Roasted Spatchcock with Mushroom Gravy &amp; Roasted Vegetables. #spatchcock #roast #foodporn #sgfood #burpple

Wagyu Burger. Patty was a little bland on it\'s own, but not bad with the mustard sauce and tomatoes. #wagyu #beef #burger #western #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Homemade Crab Cakes. A little on the bland side. #crabcakes #western #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
I love this place - love the decor, bright chirpy colours, everything feels so cozy and sunshine

This is now my favourite place to chill, relax. They do served very affordable brunch menu.
One of the best drink I\'ve ordered. Very refreshing!
Eggs benny (a must try at all new brunch places), croque monsieur, crab cakes and the random mee siam with poached eggs... which turned out to be pretty darn awesome! @claireteo @squeakella @gly86
Mornings following a rainy night are just the right temperature. Nice and cool, great for sleeping in but perfect to be outside in the otherwise sunny Singapore. \n<br />Enjoyed a good breakfast at this new cafe bistro hidden at the outskirts of a housing estate.
Break @w39bistro for their afternoon set waffles- 2 Pax @ $19++. Comes with 2 scoops of Ice Cream and drinks. \n<br />.\n<br />#foodphotography\n<br />#foodstagram #foodiesg \n<br />#sgfood #singaporefoodie\n<br />#sgfoodie #discoversg \n<br />#foodpornsg #sgeats #foodsg\n<br />#sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfood \n<br />#foodporn #foodgasm \n<br />#explorefood #exploreflavours\n<br />#exploresg #instadaily\n<br />#instafood_sg #instafood \n<br />#instagood #iweeklyfood \n<br />#8dayseat #burpple

This recently launched Kimchi Cocktail ($15) is a pretty interesting take on infusing kimchi into an otherwise less interesting drink.\n<br />-\n<br />The vodka and apricot liqueur based drink comes with kimchi salad and beetroot-pickled shallots, which are perfect as a prelude to the drink as their tartness and spiciness excite your tastebuds. Sip the drink and the lemon juice and egg white in the concoction washes away the spiciness, leaving a subtle sweetness that lingers around.\n<br />-\n<br />A savoury cocktail not to be missed by any korean food lover or anyone who simply loves a good drink.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @w39bistro for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for the invite.\n<br />Handmodel: @shermyyy\n<br />-\n<br />W39 Bistro &amp; Bakery\n<br />39 Jalan Mas Puteh\n<br />Singapore 128637\n<br />-\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#singapore #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #sgig #igsg #sgfood #instasg #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #foodpornsg #sgcafefood #BurppleSG #Burpple #igfood #foodporno #instafoodie #foodgram #foodstagram #exploresingapore #wishuponatart_eats #kimchi #korean #cocktail

Served with a side of Kimchi Salad &amp; beetroot-pickled shallots. 🍸\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Start by having the Beetroot-Pickled Shallots to excite the palate, moving to the kimchi that will leave a spicy aftertaste. 🌶\n<br />.\n<br />Wash the spiciness away with the assistance of lemon juice &amp; egg white that resides in the cocktail. The sweetness from the apricot &amp; the sweet savouriness of the kimchi comes together surprisingly harmoniously well. 😋\n<br />Launching soon in August.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #w39 #w39bistro #hiddengem #bistro #kimchi #cocktail
🍴\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: To me, chicken is boring. It\'s for people who don\'t know how/what to eat orders despite other choices. It\'s playing it safe like even some \"Michelin Starred\" places does it. Looking at you Les A Miss &amp; O-date. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />However given that it\'s Chicken Breast, it\'s moist &amp; drenched Wine Cream Sauce that spectacularly is quite tasty with notes of Chinese wine lingering.

Their coffee is a little on the bitter side. Although the steamed milk does make it slightly sweeter, but I prefer my coffee a little more acidic and a little smoother 😣.

The food are a little pricey especially with the surcharges however for a cost place for brunch with your girlfriends or boyfriend, this is a good place!

Real crab meat in the patty! #yum
This is very nicely done!! The duck meat is tender enu to be easily shredded from the bone but yet still maintaining the texture of chewiness. #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafe #cafeculture #cafe #singapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodie #foodporn #confitofduckleg #duck #duckmeat #brunch #foodstagram #burrple #w39cafe #w39bistro #w39

Private party dining 
cakes were just nice, not too sweet! had their Wagyu Burger and were just \"okay\"... not too bad though! really good ambience but they should have more air com seats!
The breakfast was actually good and decent. Prices are relatively cheaper than most cafes. Worth the try. Coffee was good too !
Definitely fluffiest I\'ve had so far. 👍赞
:D
$12.50. It was crunchy outside and juicy inside. Awesome. 
Very very good. Duck so tender.

Brunch in ma hood #brunch #onthetable #w39bistro
This is W39 Bistro, its blue and yellow colour combi is just so pleasant. Besides serving up delicious fresh food, it also sells some of those old school snacks which all the 80s and 90s babies would have been fond of once! Hidden gem at Clementi indeed! #w39bistro #cafe #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #singapore
$13 
Ribena Lemon Twist : $4.50             Eggs Benedict : $9
On weekends it\'s for enjoyment. #confessionsofanaddict #coffee
This place has a really niche design. So much more cozy than Drips . Ordered crab cakes and a ribena lemon twist. Love it :) #foodphotography #foodporn #foodie #foodsg #burpple #instafood #foodforfoodies #fuzel
Coffees and (a nibbled) cake.
Just can\'t get enough of rainbow cakes
