Savoury and \'gao\' broth for the fish head steamboat ($39) is all I can ask for after a long day at work.
Love the sam lo hor fun at this place, but it can afford to be a little wetter. Overall, this is the place to go for an awesome zichar/hor fun fix ☺️ #burpple #burpplesg #samlohorfun #zichar #jiaklocal #sghawkers #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #exploresingapore #onthetable #whati8today #tslmakan #stfoodtrending

Assam Curry Fish Head.  The fish head looks rather creepy with its bulging eye and sharp teeth. 🐟🐟🐟 (Date: 2 August 2015 Sunday)
Herbal chicken. Apparently a special for today. $24
开工 yummy! 太饿了,把鱼生吃完了.. 哈哈 😄
