🐖🐖🐖\n<br />The minced meat isn\'t too salty or overpowering which i\'m surprised espcially in sg, it\'s hard to find nice lu rou fan. The cabbage is soft and flavourful while the salted veg balance out the overall taste cause of the saltiness. 👍
Awesomeeee

Beancurd here is smooth - you\'ve got your usual dessert form served with syrup and longan and then there\'s the savoury version served with minced meat in very fragrant sesame oil. A little on the salty side but it\'s okay if you don\'t eat it by itself but have it with the beancurd that cuts through all that saltiness. Felt like dinner round 2.

Awesome dinner! It really had the authentic Taiwanese taste! (Starting top left, in clockwise direction) 卤肉饭 braised meat rice, 葱油饼 spring onion pancake (which was my fav out of these four, must try!), 烧饼加肉松加蛋 toasted bun with pork floss and egg, 锅贴 pan-fried dumplings. \n<br />The price was really cheap too! Definitely less than $4 each, I think the spring onion pancake was only $1.50! \n<br />#food #foodie #foodlover #foodgram #foodpictures #sgfood #sgfoodie #yongheeatinghouse #taiwanesefood

The once upon a time popular Yong He Soya Bean Milk and Fried Dough Sticks. It has relocated here. I heard that it\'s not as good as before and someone stopped me from buying a dough stick to munch. #Breakfast #Gardenia #GardeniaMakan #makan #foodposting #Singapore #Geylang #soyabeanmilk #frieddoughsticks #早餐 #永和豆浆油条 #新加坡 #芽笼
