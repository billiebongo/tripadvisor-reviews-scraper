Whenever I have cravings for paella , FOC is the top place that comes to my mind . The paella never fails to impress me . Have visited FOC many times and food standards have been very consistent ! 
Fresh, large and succulent, the prawns basked in a lip smackingly garlicky sauce that was just begging to be mopped up with toasted bread.
Sous vide for 12 hours before being charcoal grilled, the paprika and olive oil dressed octopus was amiably smoky and tender within whilst boasting just the right amount of crunchy chewiness. Served on a bed of mash potato.
Technically, \"Bu√±uelos de Bacalao\" can be called \"fishballs\" but they\'re nothing like our Singapore hawker version. I guess you can say they\'re \"a different kettle of fish\" altogether - heh heh üòú\n<br />Anyway, these cod fish fritters that\'re fried to a gorgeous gold, were deliciously creamy and smooth within. I found the flavour of fish just right (not too strong at all) and the green apple pur√©e a clever complement. Best eaten when they\'re hot for maximum gratification.
Coming in a close second to FOC\'s Squid Ink Paella is this saffron tinged beauty. Brimming with tender cuttlefish pieces mixed into the aromatic, wet goodness of the sofrito and broth infused rice, then topped with the sweetest scampi I\'ve had in a while. This is a seafood lover\'s dream come true.
Cinnamon and sugar dusted, fantastically fluffy pillows of Torrija(or Spanish French Toast), with an indulgently custard-like core, served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Eat at your own peril, because you\'ll be wanting more.
Milky, citrus and cinnamon infused custard with an appealing brulee on top. The key differences between this and the similar looking creme brulee is that creme catalana doesn\'t necessarily contain cream, owing its texture to cornstarch and is cooked stirring it at low heat.
Whilst the savoury dishes at FOC are represented by down to earth food executed well, its desserts are all about theater and spectacle. Enter the Chocolate Galaxy -- A glossy, gold dusted hollow dark chocolate sphere on a bed of chocolate crumble. Moments later, cue the appearance of a jug of hot chocolate sauce being slowly drizzled onto the sphere, causing it to slowly collapse inwards in beautiful, melty slow motion.
I like hot buns and I cannot lie. Seriously though, this dessert made a scorching entrance with our waitress spooning flaming rum onto the pastry. I almost lost my eyebrows in the ensuing aftermath. Said pastry however, was more breadlike in texture than the Parisian version I\'m accustomed to, and also lacked the crucial(in my eyes) step of being thoroughly pre-soaked in rum before being served, resulting in an overly strong outer coating of rum and slightly drier center. Sadly, I appreciated the spectacle of fire more than the dessert itself. Because, some men just want to watch the world burn.
Perfect for three to share(or one with a really big appetite), the pork ribs are tender and flavourful, and go quite well with the smoky pumpkin puree. A simple but hearty and delicious dish that should not be overlooked amongst the more exotic options on the menu.
This savoury lollipop(Gilda means lollipop) is the perfect bite-sized pinxto to have with pre-dinner cocktails or white wine. A Basque classic, it is traditionally assembled with a crisp, mild and spicy sweet guindilla pepper, olive, and anchovy. FOC pimps up the original with the addition of smoked seabass and pickles. Eat in a single bite for a melange of sweet, sour, spicy and smoky flavours that\'s sure to whet your appetite for more.
There\'s alot of flavour packed into these bite-sized morsels of tender beef, mustard and diced pickles sandwiched between fluffy buns, however proceedings can get a little over rich and greasy especially with that dollop of kimuchi mayo on top.
Is a burger STILL a burger if the bun is made of vanilla ice-cream coated in crisp white chocolate, and holds a patty of dark chocolate ice-cream topped with mango disguised as cheese, strawberry as tomato and a mint leaf as lettuce? ü§î Please leave your answers below ü§ì
Served as a slab, then sliced at the table, the grilled Iberico pork ribs were literally dripping with juice. The tender meat was also deeply aromatic due to the generous amount of herbs used. Just as delish was the accompanying smoked pumpkin pur√©e - we enjoyed it even more after it had soaked up some of the oil from the cut-up ribs. I highly recommend getting this dish if you love pork. 
Get the tastebuds tingling and ready for the meal ahead with these mini skewers. This was just the start of our delicious night at FOC.\n<br />‚Ä£ FOC Restaurant, 40 Hong Kong St, Singapore 059679\n<br />#FOCsg #FOCrestaurant
If you are hot for some sensuous chocolate, you should not miss this.\n<br />First, you will be presented with a plate upon which a chocolate sphere (it is slightly bigger than a tennis ball and hollow within) rests on a bed of chocolate crumbs. The server then proceeds to pour hot chocolate sauce all over that perfect roundness, causing it to melt and fall apart, revealing a few little balls of chocolate hidden inside. The \"mess\" of luxuriously smooth and rich chocolate that now lies before you, is ready to be spooned up and slowly savoured.\n<br />This divine dessert is one of those that undoubtedly qualifies as a feast for both the eyes and the palate. \n
Piping hot and sparkling with sugar crystals, the pair of fat, cinnamon-dusted pillows are puffed up with a luscious custard filling and served with housemade vanilla ice-cream. So don\'t be fooled by the rather nondescript name of Spanish \"French Toast\" this goes by, or you\'ll miss out on a really fabulous dessert.
Presentation is everything. Which is why an order of the Santa\'s Coffee martini in its distinct cocoa powder-coated glass ended up on our table. But it wasn\'t just the way it looked that we found pleasing. The cocktail itself was a very drinkable sweet, coffee-flavoured concoction of vodka, a real espresso shot, paprika smoked cream, sugar, cocoa powder and orange zest. If you are too full to have dessert, this is another blissful way to round off a meal here at FOC. 
This had me fooled(momentarily) when desserts were brought out and a lone burger was in their midst. Cleverly masquerading as their savoury visual counterparts were a crisp white chocolate coated ice cream filled bun, creamy chocolate ganache playing the beef patty, sliced strawberries and mango as tomato and cheese respectively, and mint leaf having the dubious honor of being faux lettuce.
We ordered two kinds of paella tonight and they were both obscenely good. This was the saffron one that tasted like it had been simmered in some super potent shellfish bisque. It also seemed to have as many pieces of cuttlefish as it had grains of rice! üòãüòã\n<br />I don\'t know what is it about the shrimps at FOC but oh man, these were some terrifically sweet scampi! 
Smelling and looking absolutely heavenly as it hit the table, my visual and olfactory senses were already priming my tastebuds for the mouth watering paella plundering that was about to commence.
I\'ve been a fan of Chef Jordi from the days of Foodbar Dada before he moved on to head FOC. For bringing us true blue Catalan cuisine. So glad that the Black Rice he pioneered at Foodbar still remains on the menu at FOC. Luscious onyx pearls with plump prawns - delish! Best shared by two.\n<br />The tapas menu here is extensive and creative &amp; I also love the Croquettes ($10), Baby Squids ($18) &amp; Galican Octopus ($22).  Many tapas places abound in Singapore but FOC is still rocking our nights!
The name is Magnum. The look is Magnum. BUT IT IS NOT A MAGNUM!
Fits in the mouth with zero effort. But the effort that goes into making this is not to be sniffed at. Each piece of potato is handcut in a way that makes it look like the pages of a book. When fried, more texture is created via the crisped finish along the many edges. Rounding that off nicely are the blobs of creamy garlic aioli and tomato-based sauce. 
\nI learned 3 things last night.
Slide the entire skewer into your mouth and I guarantee all your senses will be blasted wide awake. The cacophony of flavours comes courtesy of the salty anchovy, smoked seabass, a squeaky olive, a spicy pepper and crunchy, pickled veg. Quite the perfect thing to have with your first drink. And also as a tapas-in-betweener, which I discovered when I couldn\'t resist ordering  another. üòÅ 
This is by far my fave dish, it isn\'t easy to cook an octopus, this dish was nicely done using the josper oven. That first bite really melts in your mouth, it was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potato underneath compliments the whole dish. I will definitely recommend  this for those who haven\'t tried it.
We were at FOC for dinner the other night, not only their food was delicious but their cocktails are as tasty as it looks. We had cusco sour and we love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è we definitely will come back n try their other cocktails!
This Paella is mouth watering, i was in barcelona just last year and it takes me back there. The restaurant itself has a great vibin atmosphere that gives the oomph! Will definitely come back for more!
FOC style meant a caramelised WHOLE cored apple that was so smooth and tender (was it poached beforehand?). It lent tartness that went well with the vanilla ice cream and graham cracker tart crust below. So much innovativeness.
Everything here is made of chocolate/ice cream, including the bun and patty. Garnished with fresh strawberries and mint leaves to lighten it all up. It was actually pretty delicious.
Gotta admit this was pretty good but not mindblowing, and this has a lot to do with the fresh, juicy, almost fruity tomatoes. The toasted brioche made in-house was only okay.
Prawns stuck to their shell. Hm. But a deeply warming and satisfying white wine broth.
Gotta love how tender this was - absolutely NO rubbery- or springiness! Such a nice mouthfeel and the char emerges as you keep chewing, hit in the nose by the cayenne.
Ahh melting chocolate spheres - overdone. BUT when the chocolate is damnnn good (as it was in this case, luscious, dark, hint of bitterness) you WON\'T STOP.
This was okay. Exactly as it was described in the menu. The hot plate scrambled the eggs which enveloped the potatoes and spicy chorizo.
Nice juicy, gamey patties (i like a bit of game) but nothing to really shout about.. Also the addition of the kimchi mayo is a bit gimicky - more mayo than kimchi.
$24. Delicious, though on the salty side. Still prefer the squid ink paella though!
suckling pig with tender meat and crispy skin is so good , must try üëç
Top left: charcoal grilled octopus\n<br />Top right: Mushroom croquettes and crab croquettes\n<br />Bottom left: Squid ink paella\n<br />Bottom right: Lamb ribs 
Extremely good octopus ($22). Meaty, tender and flavorful. Definitely not the rubbery stuff you get at a run of the mill restaurant. Only gripe is that there were too many charred bits which made the bites slightly too bitter. Mashed potato with paprika was awesome too. Portion was perfect for tapas. Highly recommend. 
Highly highly recommended. Good for sharing ($26) and worth every penny. Each grain of rice was plump, distinct and flavorful, with octopus chunks mixed in. Topped with fresh prawns and clams which were yummy with the sweet taste of seafood. Enjoyed every bite. 
(Pardon the grainy image; that was the best my iPhone could do in lowlight.)
And it tasted every bit as delicious as it sounded. Bold, yet well-balanced flavours worked in perfect harmony. That creamy dollop gracing the crisp, English muffin-like bun is a very delicious kimuchi (Japanese take on kimchi) mayo which deserves a special mention for lending a mouth-puckering piquancy to the mix.
It\'s both a hit and a miss for this starter, for which I had high expectations. Slow-cooking and charcoal grilling rendered a sufficiently moist texture for the octopus, but I found it wanting in the flavour department. Count on the humble sidekick to save the dish instead. Embedded with potato bits, the mash was creamy, buttery, and absolutely addictive.
While its presentation was eye-catching and impressive, it certainly left more to be desired. Essentially form over substance, this didn\'t taste particularly special. Basically some sort of baked bread with flaming rum poured over. The bread was kind of dry, while the rum just gave it quite an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Not particularly palatable, and was too heavy especially after a full meal. At least the flames were nice to look at. Priced at $14. Not recommended. 
This was certainly the highlight of the night. Served only on certain days, we were lucky enough to get to get a taste of this. The meat was so tender that it just came apart with the slightest pull of the fork. Every bite is melt in your mouth. The best part had to be the skin; crispy, but not too hard and chewy. It\'s amazing how they manage to cook it to this level of perfection. So good and so worth the extra calories. 
The lamb was quite well-cooked, although I would have preferred it a little more rare as I thought it was a bit tough. The curry yoghurt and eggplant pur√©e provided an interesting flavor combination which really helped to mellow the natural intense flavor of lamb. While tasty, it wasn\'t mind-blowing and I think their squid ink paella, or suckling pig (if they happen to be selling it that day) are better options. Priced at $22 for 2 pieces. 
Really intense flavors from the cuttlefish and saffron combo. Again, the dish was executed very well as with their food in general. The rice was cooked perfectly; not too wet nor mushy. The cuttlefish was really soft and tender, and they were quite generous with their portions. I did feel that the dish was a little too overpowering and could get a bit gelat towards the end. I still think that their squid ink reigns supreme here, I would recommend that over this one. Priced at $26. Good for sharing so that you can try out more variety. 
One of my favourites to order at Spanish restaurants, you cane never go wrong with squid ink paella. The rice is cooked perfectly- not too hard, but not too mushy either. I really like how small pieces of squid are hidden amongst the rice, and really gives it a great texture. The seafood was quite fresh, and the squid ink flavour was really pronounced. Great dish to order and share. 
Basically prawns cooked in a garlic and white wine sauce. Tbh I was a tad disappointed with this one. While the sauce was quite tasty, the prawns were a little powdery to me and didn\'t seem that fresh. 
I don\'t know how they do it but the octopus was incredibly soft and tender. No rubbery consistency that we would expect of squid or octopus. Probably because, as the menu describes it, it was slow-cooked and charcoal grilled. The mash potato was so light and fluffy, and the octopus itself really flavourful. Great way to start a meal, and really gets your appetite going. 
These little fried nuggets of goodness will leave you wanting more. Bursting with creamy mushroom goodness, you will be willing to burn your tongue on this because you won\'t be able to stop at just one bite. The exterior is light and crispy, and its simple exterior hides the incredible mushroom inside. Smooth and creamy, it\'s almost like mushroom soup, and I mean that in a good way. Definitely should order this. Great as an appetizer. Priced at $10 for 4 pieces. 
Scramble egg, chorizo and sliced potatoes. One of my favorites from this tapas restaurant-bar. 
I could use a touch more lemon juice in that aioli, but I\'ve always been fond of acids. And, you know something\'s good when your dinner companions leave you \n<br />ONE.\n<br />FRITTER. \n<br />@dwaynemuang @junkielicious xx
Both were outstandingly well done, crisp exterior, piping hot gooey insides with an abundance of either mushroom or Spanish ham. The Mushroom Croquettes had me wishing for seconds though! \n<br />10bucks/4 croquettes \n<br />#FTrecommends
too small though. 10 pieces wouldn\'t even tickle my tummy.
Deep fried croquettes were so yummy!!! The outer layer was very crispy and does not have the greasy taste to it, while keeping it\'s interior creamy and light. Definitely recommend this as it would be something that everyone would enjoy! 
Not the most flattering of pictures because I couldn\'t really get a good angle, but here are the beef cheek sliders. Each serving comes with 2 pieces and as you can see, each burger is rather small :p the beef cheeks are soft and tender, melts delicately in your mouth. The mustard inside helps to tame the beefy aftertaste of the meat. The Kimuchi mayo on top was more texture than taste though and felt a bit unnecessary as it made the dish a bit too creamy and overwhelming. 
On first notice, this plate of paella didn\'t look like much. Topped with really fresh seafood and some garlic aioli, the black rice looks overly simplified for it\'s price. Before consumption, the entire plate was mixed to evenly distribute the aioli to give it a nice creamy texture. I loved how I could also taste the individual rice grains. It\'s a really nicely done paella. To my surprise, there were also bits of cut up octopus mixed together with the rice. Really a delectable treat! Would have put this on my full marks if not for the not so great portion (it\'s a tapas bar anyhow) and the slightly steep price tag but I would say that it\'s worth it. Definitely worth a try if you\'re visiting the bistro. 
This dish is self-explanatory - Baked potatoes, eggs and chorizo sausages. The potatoes were slightly crispy which gives and extra dimension of texture. I could describe this as \'the taste of breakfast\'. 
Founded by 2 Singaporean businessmen and Michelin-starred chef Nandu Jubany, FOC is a bistro that serves up Catalan cuisine (essentially Spanish tapas) boasting some very unique and personalized interior design. 
The Iberico ham with tomato jam toast was a winner! At $30 for a decent amount, we were satisfied and would order again!
Wow, I don\'t even know where to start with this. Between two slices of lightly grilled steamed bread that gently melts in the mouth, lies a thin glaze of mustard and savory kimuchi (the Japanese rendition of kimchi) mayo that adds pinch of saltiness to thick shreds of extremely tender beef; braised for three hours to exude a nice hint of smokiness. Absolutely divine.
So delicious 
There aren\'t many bars that make stunning cocktails at outrageously affordable prices, but FOC is definitely one of them. Our cocktail arrived in an elegant snifter glass completely coated in cinnamon powder. This concoction of house-made cinnamon cacha√ßa, honey water, fresh passion fruit juice and freshly squeezed lime (shaken and double strained with egg white) is a palate opener; its citrus aromas against cinnamon awaking the sense before whetting the appetite with a sweet kind of sourness‚Äîa great aperitif to start the meal!
Great seafood stock in this scrumptious authentic paella dish. Our latest restaurant reciew on FOC is up at the blog!
This doesn\'t look good on a photo, but taste wise it definitely does! Topped with fresh clams and prawns, don\'t be fooled that this is all. Amongst the grains of rice, there is a generous amount of octopus. Squid ink can be rather tasteless at most places, but this was a wholesome flavorful pan of rice which you can taste the essence of the abundance amount of seafood used. Remember to give it a quick mix as the bottom may get \"burnt\" too much.  
The octopus was prepared using the slow cooked method, which means the meat is cooked to the same degree throughout. This results in the sweetness being retained and a tender yet firm meat. Nothing can go quite wrong on a bed of mash and paprika sprinkled on top!
Madame Tussaud must have mistook her lunchbox for her toolbox. This baby is so pretty and delicate that it probably should go on my desk rather than down my oesophagus but.....ooops. You\'re probably paying more for the Oooh factor and the Instagram opportunity than for the portion size, though. 4/5
Mouthwatering delicious. I love how the caviar bursts and melts in the midst of all that flavor. 
Loved this. Rich yet not overly filling. Love the flavors in the midst of each grain. Definitely the choice of carb for the night.
Flambee at the table. Delicious rum baba. Very flavourful. Have it with the chantilly  ice cream. It is goodddd
Here is the Galician Octopus with potatoes at FOC restaurant. Review up on blog. Link in bio. Www.ms-skinnyfat.com
Grilled ribeye with red peppers on the side. Head Chef Jordi must love his meats very fatty, judging from the gelatinous confit pork belly and this cut of beef, which I unfortunately couldn\'t stomach very well. 
One of the best octopus dishes in town, the tender, slightly chewy flesh soaking in the earthy olive oil and paprika. Perfectly paired with chunky smashed potatoes. 
Stack together \"buns\" of chilled vanilla mousse encased in white chocolate (toasted so it has a pale khaki colour and an alluring toasty flavour), a \"patty\" of dark chocolate mousse, mango \"sliced cheese\", strawberry \"tomatoes\" and mint leaf \"lettuce\", and you have the adorably witty FOC Chocolate Burger. Each slider costs $12, a fair price for the blissful union of fruity and chocolatey textures and flavours. 
Props to that crispy glazed skin, but I really didn\'t like the gelatinous confit pork belly beneath ‚Äì it certainly melted, but I\'d have like a little bit of a meaty bite before that. I\'d say skip this dish, but then again, I know a few people who love the very fattiness that I didn\'t. 
Al dente rice stained and inky and given an extra nudge of flavour with dollops of garlicky aioli. Fresh prawns and clams adorn the top. I\'d say this makes a good serving size for 4 alongside other tapas. 
Seared scallops in dashi with beads of soy sauce. Creative and immensely tasty. 
Served chilled over smoked olive oil ice cream, which when stirred into the soup, adds a gentle earthiness that tempers the tang and sweetness of the soup just right. 
Today, I\'m craving for these nuggets of crunchy breadcrumbs, filled with chopped button mushrooms luxuriating in the creamiest bechamel ever. Heaven-sent, I\'m positive. 
Medium rare grilled ribeye, served with grilled bellpeppers. Succulent good quality meat, delicious! 
Very tender melt in your mouth josper grilled lamb chop with grilled pumpkin leek and snow peas. Recommended! 
Octopus Galician style, prepared with paprika, olive oil and potatoes. A must try item from their menu! 
Prawns in rich garlic and white wine sauce, will not order it again next time. It is not bad but lack of wow factor
Headed by Michelin-starred chef Nandu Jubany, in collaboration with Executive Chef Jordi Noguera and ex-Catalunya barman Dario Nocentini comes FOC - a spanking new Spanish tapas restaurant and cocktail bar. With such acclaimed people at the helm, you can expect food and drinks of fantastic quality. Choose from a great range of classic tapas with modern twists, but their hearty black mediterranean paella with seafood and garlic mayo ($22) is a must-try. End off the meal with their unique FOC chocolate burger ($12) for dessert, it\'s adorable!
Latest restaurant to blow me away is this tapas bar opened by one Michelin-starred chef Nandu Jubany and helmed by former Foodbar Dada head chef Jordi Noguera and ex-Catalyuna bar manager Dario Knox. Food starts from $6 and cocktails from $12 ‚Äì way lower than what I\'d expect to pay for such a colourful and exciting menu. 
There\'s nothing quite like the perfect crispy crackling to set off the succulent meat, but the pork belly was a little too gelatinous. Overall, still a good dish.
This is one of today\'s specials, Beef Carpaccio with micuit foie gras ($18). 
Delicious menu with a wide selection of food and drinks, all served in a modern setting. They obviously put a lot of thought into the details for this place as every time you look you see something new like the domino bar. My favorites were within others the grilled scallops with caviar from the specials menu, the jamon and the octopus. Have to return soon for the crispy pork tacos.
Super tender perfectly medium rare and chef Jordi offered to heat up a little half way through for us because we were so busy munching on other food and taking pics! That\'s FOCing good service hehe
The cutest dessert I\'ve ever seen. It\'s ice-cream! 
Sauteed cauliflower ($16)-very peppery, pretty decent 3.75/5\n

To be honest, I was captivated by the description on the menu and had absolutely no idea what this was
4/5
But overall I think this dish is a miss
The clams however paled in comparison to the dish, uneventful and rather bland. 4/5 for this dish.. Gotta up your game clams

Just make sure you get enough seasoning on each piece though for it to hit the spot. Still a must order at #foc Quote @super_medium \"This is what octopus should taste like for this first time. Not like rubber and plastic.\" #burpple #janthefood #focsg #focrestaurant @foc_restaurant
Nice and tender, with an excellent marinade. Amazing pumpkin pure√©.
Strongly recommend the Paella and the baby squid üëàüèº! #burpple
A yummy way to start the week!! üòâ

seafood were fresh and it made for a good starter
you gotta do it yourself, scramble you own eggs!
playful, tasteful and very comical indeed.
Loved it. Except the failed cream puff it in.
These beef cheek sliders may look tiny, but they do pack a punch of flavors. Pull apart the \"patty\" and you can find a generous amount of tender braised beef  cheeks meat. The home made little buns were grilled till slightly crispy and topped with mustard and kimuchi mayo which makes it delightful! 
Here are their moreish sliders stuffed with oh-so buttery foie gras, marinated shiitake and julienned green apple.
ANYTIME.
This is def my new fav tapas bar. Tangy and refreshing gazpacho with olive oil ice cream here.
One of my very favourite dishes here: pulled pork scooped in shells of crumbly deep-fried pastry instead of tortillas, garnished with dou miao and drizzlings of zingy kimchi mayo. 
I enjoyed the Madame Butterfly, a potent mix with refreshingly sour notes.
We had an excellent meal all round seated right in front of Chef Jordi. Right down to the excellent wine at $10.50 a glass! It was Ning\'s early bday celeb and such a perfect way to celebrate. Food was fresh not overstated, refreshing. We went through the courses very smoothly and happily ending with the chocolate burger at $12 and the Torrija $10. The Jordi fav cocktail was only $14 and is a bloody Mary type with an Asian sour twist. Dario the mixologist said it had 1.5 shots of tequila in it. Couldn\'t taste the alcohol.. I suppose it\'s a silent killer.
