That changed, the moment I ate Ramen a couple of weeks ago. Yesterday, I ate sushi and enjoyed other Japanese delicacies only because I didn\'t have to eat RAW seafood or meat. All the food I ate was PURE VEGETARIAN. In the pictures you can see Unagi ( one of the reasons I tried out this dish is because of F.R.I.E.N.D.S), Meat Balls and Dumplings. Definitely going to be trying more Japanese vegetarian dishes. \n<br />#Dinnercenes #Singapore  #Singaporediaries  #foodofsingapore #singaporefood \n<br />#sgfoodblogger #foodie #foodiegram #foodiediaries  #foodiesofsingapore #singaporefoodie #foodporn #foodgasm  #lovinsingapore #ilovesg #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfood  #yoursingapore  #bestfoodsingapore #sgfoodblogger #burpple  #instafoodsg #foodinsg #visitsingapore #exploresingapore  #lunchoftheday  #singaporefoodies  #japanesecuisine #unagi

Unagi maki. Avocado maki. Miso ramen. 😊 (haha so I kind of attended all the units after-peak celebration coz I crashed another 2 units😂) #burpple
Not 😏
Calamari was unexpectedly good; firm texture made me though that I\'m eating the actual stuff! Tempura was poor, so bland that I solely tasted the tempura batter, feels like the \"ebi\" wasn\'t even seasoned. Another bad point was the service, would a waitress ask you to foot the bill 30mins before closing? 🤔
Somen was light and refreshing, nothing special with the fried tofu. Special mention to the salad (top left), housemade spicy mayo with crispy bits of soybean skin I think, polished it clean. The major letdown was the sushi , taste NOTHING like sashimi; bland, taste like boiled fish cake. Quite a unique experience I must say. \n<br />#vegetarian #starvingtime  #whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti
Wasn\'t expecting much. Surprised with this grilled mushroom that came with a slight \"charred\" taste, along with a crispy surface. Good. 👍 \n<br />#vegetarian #starvingtime  #whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti
