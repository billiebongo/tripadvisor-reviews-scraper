Peanut Butter üçå Waffles ($11.9) How\'s everyone doing this weekend? How about some brunch at Group Therapy? Aren\'t you east siders happy they are now opened to save you trouble travelling to Duxton Hill! Waffles placed above a bed of peanut butter, banana drenched in maple syrup ! üòã What a way to start your weekends! Happy Easter!
Prefer their mint chocolate, but went with this since I needed some morning caffeine ‚òï
Perfectly poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce on top of smoked salmon and brioche! The saltiness of the salmon went perfectly well with the brioche and the eggs. 
For this Cafe Week, the menu from Group Therapy Coffee will end your meal on a sweet note with their popular sticky date pudding served with vanilla caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.
The lineup includes a vegetarian, chicken and seafood dish.
Starting off with a refreshing and luxurious appetizer of a Crab and Asparagus Salad followed by a selection of entrees in which you can choose from a chicken to seafood dish and even vegetarian. What\'s a meal without desserts as the menu rounds off with a serving of their popular Sticky Date Pudding.
Just enough for 2 light-eaters. A delicious plate of goodness!
Lovely crust on the bread, eggs were cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!
Waffle is crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. Chocolate ice cream is nice. 
The hollandaise was super rich making it really filling - would recommend sharing! 
The sauce comes with Eggyolk bits, and its fragrance makes me want to have more. So crispy yet not too oily. Love it
The coffee is okay but I really enjoyed the smoked salmon and avocado sandwich. The cafe was tucked in the opposite end of Katong V if you are entering from east coast road. Wasn\'t too crowded for a Saturday afternoon which I like! Price point is normal (I spent around $17).
Really worth the $11 because it was a generous portion of a whole waffle, with a slab of peanut butter and honey and topped with bananas and crushed pistachio nuts!!! 
Well poached eggs, with yolk oozing out when sliced. Saltiness from smoked salmon helped to provide added flavour to the dish. Thumbs up for the generous amount of smoked salmon
Poached eggs with salmon on thick toast. Look at that salmon haha. And grilled chicken salad. Noms for two. Tgt with a mixed berry and yoghurt smoothie. Awesome Monday start!
Warm chocolate brownie sitting atop a heap of \'chocolate soil\', topped with a huge scoop of vanilla bean icecream, drizzled with salted egg yolk sauce, all for the price of $10. The icecream was good and I believe it was homemade (have been wanting to check out \'Regroup x Scoop Therapy\', GTC\'s new icecream cafe already, which I believe was where the icecream came from). Salted egg yolk sauce was mediocre though and the \'chocolate soil\' did left me with an almost sore-throat building up.
The toast was fluffy but rather burnt, the eggs nicely buttery and the mushrooms happily moist. I was undecided about the bacon - it may not have been my preferred crispy type, but it was ultimately competently fatty, chewy and salty. The massive bratwurst was the disappointment - despite its looming phallic presence, it proved to be rather gruff and tasteless. 3.6/5
This supposedly has a cult following and understandably so. The house-made pulled pork stuffed within the chewy pretzel hotdog-style bun is moist and very flavourful. In fact, I think it is good enough with just that squiggle of mustard and doesn\'t need the grilled cheese topping. But I am sure fans of this Cuban Hotdog will disagree wholeheartedly with me on this üòÜ
Lean chicken pieces and juicy mushrooms hang out in a pool of creamy Bechamel sauce that fills up a large buttery pie crust. You can tell they are having a lot of fun because the party continues in your mouth. 
Because real peppermint leaves are used to make this ice-cream, it has a wonderful wake-me-up freshness that\'s missing from others I have tried. And who doesn\'t like little bits of dark chocolate polka-dotting their minty creaminess?üòã Such a spot-on combination if there ever was one. Jazzed up with ground mixed nuts and house-made meringue sticks, this is a sweet ending I can\'t say no to. \n<br />The ice-creams served at both Group Therapy cafes at Katong Village and Duxton are all created at the new-ish third cafe under the same group: Regroup x Scoop Therapy, which means they are available there too of course. The use of Italian milk (delivered in small batches and immediately processed into ice-cream) is lower in fats as well. Hooray to a less guilty indulgence I say.\n
I always end up ordering the poached eggs with smoked salmon ($16) here. Their rendition of Caesar\'s salad ($14) comes with arugula instead of butterhead lettuce and is studded with tomato chunks, bacon bits, buttery croutons and a poached egg. The creamy and well-seasoned dressing is served on the side, so you can add as much/little as you like. Will probably skip the linguine Bolognese ($15) and lemon tart ($5.50) next time; the pasta was rather bland and the lemon tart\'s pastry was overworked while the filling was overcooked (such a shame cos the tanginess was on the money). 
Generous servings of bacon and mushroom. üëç Best thing about this place: no service charge!!
When I saw this, I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn\'t dreaming. But yes, this poppy seed creation was for real, and a rather lovely one at that.\n<br />Swirled through the block of pound cake was a streamer of lemon cream cheese. So with each slice, you get a lightly zesty facet accompanying the micro-crunchy goodness of the poppy seed cake.\n<br />Finding this made my day because I was under the impression that anything with poppy seeds -- its classified as prohibited goods by Singapore\'s Central Narcotics Bureau -- had been eradicated from Singapore\'s cafe landscape.
After over-eating on my overnight trip to Malacca, I needed to rebalance with some healthier choices. Which is why I decided on this bowl of \"Oats &amp; Fresh Fruit\" ($12 nett) for breakfast.\n<br />Served warm, it was prettily accessorised with blueberries, strawberries and banana, and flavoured with a delicious hint of cinnamon -- bonus points for the nice touch of cinnamon stick. Such a yummy and wholesome start to my day! üòÑ
Tasty stuff that I like, all in one brunch plate - yay! Stuffed in the roundish croissant were two large pieces of slightly caramelised and surprisingly non-greasy back bacon, lettuce and tomato with a smear of mustard. The salad came with a creamy Japanese sesame sauce, one of my all-time favourite dressings.
Sunday chilling over cakes and coffee. Carrot cake was moist with that nutty crunch. 
Wholesome sinful goodness on a plate!Shredded crab meat in a chilli crab sauce as filling.Pie and crab are new matchmake in heaven! 
Abandoned my usual choice of scrambled and fried eggs to have them poached this time. They turned out fine enough but my chosen brioche materialised as wheat toast. Further supporting my suspicions of a sleepwalking counter staff was that they got another order entirely wrong. What should have been two fried eggs on English muffins became one sunny side up egg with ham on thick toast. Tsk tsk. To be fair though, they admitted to their mistake and got the chef to prepare the correct item promptly.\n<br />To avoid such scenarios, it\'s probably a good idea to have the staff repeat your order back to you.
If u like shroom and bacon then this is the \'must\' order dish at GTC.If really one thing I want to commend that will be the garlic that is really charcoal black when served. 
Stacked together are three very fluffy and light pancakes. IMHO, they are as good as the ones at Strictly Pancakes. Nicely art directed with thin slices of strawberries, a few blueberries and flanked by halves of a banana, the whole effect is really photogenic. I like the scattered bits of sticky honeycomb too; they kind of spring random surprises on you with a rather intensely sweet crunch.
I\'m very thankful that Group Therapy Cafe at Katong V opens daily at 9am. Even on Mondays when most caf√©s are closed. It means I can start any day of my week on a joyful note with their creamy scrambled eggs, served with a proper English muffin that\'s been toasted and buttered to perfection. \n
Waking up my eyeballs, tastebuds and brain with these vibrantly coloured cups of coffee. Group Therapy Cafe uses a blend of two types of 100% arabica beans, one from Brazil and the other from Ethiopia. A medium-light roasting creates the bright-bodied taste with a hint of chocolate.
This is the place u definitely will fall in love with ! Try it and feel it
...paying a visit to the other branch since i\'m already in the east. i don\'t know what it is, but i just get a totally different vibe compared to the one at Duxton.
At the new group therapy outlet, a quiet less known cafe. Having my usual latte and their poached eggs over studies üò•
The attention that\'s paid to everything on The Big Plate is admirable. Plus being able to customise is a big draw. Because besides choosing how you prefer your eggs, you also get to pick your bread (brioche, multigrain, white or gluten-free). Apart from the good-sized bratwurst and bacon, special mention must go to the saut√©ed mushrooms as it\'s rather exceptional. 
If you are prefer a waffle that\'s more filling, then drop by Group Therapy Cafe. Their version is noticeably denser and heavier than many of the light-as-air ones around. Priced at $9 before GST, it is made fresh upon order and comes with maple syrup and a pat of butter.
Something different
Newly opened Group Therapy Cafe Katong. Checked it out thanks to the new Burpple Cafes Guide. More mainstream and moving away from the hipsters crowd.
The good folks of Group Therapy now provide sanity and comfort in the East, with their second outlet located in the basement of Katong V. This spacious retreat feels rather different from their first at Duxton, but the food is quite the same. Enjoy a good cup of coffee and their go-to Eggs Ben if you\'re lazy to travel all the way to Duxton on the weekend! Photo by Veronica Phua\n
Believe it or not, blanketed under all that smoked salmon and poached eggs is a thick slice of soft bread. Together with the gruyere cheese and hollandaise sauce (I prefer mine on the side), this is a tasty and filling breakfast that\'s different from the usual. I\'m so happy to have a Group Therapy Cafe in the East! :)
Great to be back to a familiar cafe, familiar friend....familiar warmth...albeit in a new location | big breakfast! #foodporn #grouptherapy
Big Plate was the way to go! Love the scrambled egg, saut√©ed mushrooms and bratwurst here!
Go-to cafe opened up a branch in the East!!!! // Dinner after a rather tragic evening of technology related problems which plague me on a daily basis... But that\'s too much emotional baggage for a photo of food üòù
Decent shot of Piccolo at reasonable prices ($4.30 includ. GST)
Our mint mocha and latte üòç

Comfort food, what you see is what you get!
But somehow I feel ravioli still goes better with a cream based sauce rather than a tomato based one
This is definitely the dish to order to pamper yourself anytime of the day
This is truly an \"awakening\"
Serving is really huge with the thick toast below and it will be difficult not to be satisfied by this appetizing dish
A hearty sandwich, really enjoyed it! üòã
A very filling and overindulgence meal. Not quite a fan of salted egg yolk food... #burple #cafesg #eastcoastroad #breadbowl #stew #saltedeggyolk #fries

Crisp and fresh with just a right amount of sweetness :)
Caramel sauce in a separate cup for added enjoyment. Waffles were warm, thick &amp; crisp on the outside and has a soft texture on the inside. Feeling üò¢üò¢abit under the weather, after 2 bites ....could only watch friend enjoying itüò¶#waffles #berries #dessertlovers #dessert #sgcafes #burpple #openricesg
Their carrot cake was good. SUPERB! The cream cheese was very nice. Cake was light and ingredients were spread around nicely in the cake. 
worth the price and nice, the filling was a lot! 
Spinach feta with cheese, it was awesome!! The cheese was nicely filled and you could feel it all inside your mouth. Crust was crispy, recommended! 
Matcha latte, awesome. But too small cup.
Great catch up over yummy food. \n<br />#grouptherapy #grouptherapycoffee #food #foodie #foodgram #igsg #igcafe #igfood #sgig #sgcafe #sgfood #cafe #cafegram #vsco #vscocam #vscofood #danmakan #dancafehop #exploresg #exploresingapore #exsgcafe #burpple

After
Before 
Can\'t really go wrong with sunny sides ups eggs, ham, guacamole on thick slice of toast. Waffles are a little too airy for my liking - so it\'s average for me. Oats and fresh fruits is pretty good - probably put a tad too much cinnamon. Seems like a cafe run by spoilt girls with no service attitude but tts probably because they are busy.
Love their light coffees.
Latte is too small &amp; milky, but the salmon &amp; avocado sandwich is awesome max! Will give em another chance on the coffee another time... #grouptherapy #cafe #katong #latelunch #lunch #latergram #salmon #avocado #sandwich #instafood #instasg #igers #igsg
