It\'s basically crepes in orange sauce with vanilla gelato. This dessert will be prepared in front of you by your table!!! 🤑$20
Amazing dish of poached eggs drizzled with Hollandaise sauce on lightly toasted buns wrapped with Parma ham... The flavours just oozes in your mouth
Dessert: tiramisu, coffee, cardamom.
Main course: Loin of fallow deer, pumpkin, passionfruit, smoked grand-veneur. Amazing how the flavors yield so beautifully together.
Cod à la grenobloise.
Probably one of our favorites is this starter of slow cooked egg with French caviar. Simple, yet refined.
Starter: king crab, smoked haddock, Granny Smith apple.
We started off the four-course luncheon with an amuse bouche of foie gras \"ice cream\" and cheese puffs – refreshing and savory, leaving us yearning for more.
4xFOUR happens now till Nov 20, featuring a stellar line-up of four internationally acclaimed Michelin-starred Chefs. \n<br />Details at www.4xfour.sg.
As much as they excel in the atmosphere and food, they fail in the dessert sector. Priced at $42++.
Love the starters and main course, every dish is carefully plated before serving. Priced at $42++.
It\'s never gonna end.\n<br />That flambé.\n<br />Brings a smile everytime.\n<br />You know it.
Also at The White Rabbit. These lemon tarts were not too bad and they were served with Acacia honey gel ice cream.
This Mangalica Pork Belly was braised for 60 hours! So fatty but I finished it!
My appetiser at The White Rabbit. No idea why I cant find the geotag. :( These scallops were really delish and I was hoping to have more! :D
Love dark chocolate! Research has shown that dark chocolate helps to ease tension. Served together with passion fruit ice cream. Another dessert that\'s very nice is the baked Alaska which is very rare to find in Singapore. Really not bad! Love it!
With truffle miso glaze, parsnip purée and field mushroom. Very nice and tender short rib!
Basically, it\'s a fish in a bag. It\'s really not easy to perfect Papillote. Timing is everything. The fish cannot be undercooked and overcooked. This is really good stuff! The fish is very fresh and the sauce is dope.
Love this crunchiness of the rocket salad and the nutty flavor from the pine nuts!
Garnish with micro basil and extra virgin olive oil. I was expecting to see a ball of cheese but was greeted with this. Still good and nice. Love it with their tomato and basil bread to balance out the saltiness.
Sinfully good! The size of the macaroni is so small! I like it though. Served in a nice pot from de Buyer. Haha!
had high expectation for this famed tagliatelle in pork broth, kombu with alaskan king crab. the broth hits all the sweet spot alright but alas, i think it was too wet for me and pasta is not al dente at all. in fact, lesson learnt - am prolly not a pasta in broth person. period.
Dorper Lamb Rack in ratatouille lemongrass basil jus - we asked for medium but if u ask me, it was more like medium rare with too much pink. not that i am complaining, i always love my pink! soaked in the jus and all is heaven
Dinner at The White Rabbit! It\'s was a casual dinner after work. Very nice restaurant and prompt service. But was a little noisy... But overall it\'s a great experience! 
If a touch of whimsy is what you\'re looking for in your wedding, then The White Rabbit is a restaurant and bar housed in a might be the venue for you. It is a beautifully restored old chapel off the Dempsey area and serves a fresh take on both Classic European comfort foods and cocktails. 
Known to be one of the most romantic settings a restaurant could have, this refurbished old chapel is just the perfect place for a date. Opt for the 4-course Valentine\'s Day menu at $128, you\'re going to enjoy a lovely night with their overall excellent food and service. 
So pretty! My pastry chef is better than your pastry chef hor. LOL!
Pretty place for dates with immaculate service. 
Oxtail simmered in a chunky tomato sauce till the meat easily falls off the bone with roasted Ratte potatoes. The potatoes had a mild chestnut-like flavour that I really liked!
Saucisson, smoked duck breast, andouuliette, mushroom terrine, duck rilette (my favourite!) and pickled vegetables to start a lovely meal!
Served with a seared foie gras on top, lobster meat and natural jus. The seared foie gras was so rich, soft and creamy. It was perfect, the saving grace for the decent risotto.

It\'s a classic dish that\'s done well at White Rabbit! The poached eggs were done just right such that the yolk wasn\'t too runny but could still melt in your mouth. The bread was crisp yet soft. Smoked salmon added taste (slightly salty on its own) to the entire dish. 
Brunch situation 💯
I saved the worst for the last. In this fillet, I found 6 fish bones. They weren\'t the tiny kinds, but were sizeable and visible. I even swallowed one by accident, I guess for extra calcium. The response from the staff was a cursory apology and a promise to relay the finding to the chef. And that was it. 😡 *2 course set lunch S$34, 3 course set lunch S$42
Possibly the only thing I enjoyed was the location and ambience of the restaurant. 😐 *2 course set lunch S$34, 3 course set lunch S$42
Duck duck jus. 🦆 *2 course set lunch S$34, 3 course set lunch S$42
Was alright, also a bit on the saltier side. I\'m a bit amused at the bubbles. 🛁 *2 course set lunch S$34, 3 course set lunch S$42
I do not deny that the scallops were succulent and plump. But I was no-way wow-ed by them. Maybe it was because it seemed like the scallops weren\'t washed after they were retrieved from the sea, so salty as if it was soaked with salt water!!! Not worth it for an additional $8. 🙅🏻‍♂️ 2 course set lunch S$34\n<br />3 course set lunch S$42
But a pretty \"meh\" dish. 💁🏻 2 course set lunch S$34\n<br />3 course set lunch S$42
Dug the menu off the Chope website/app- thought they\'d have set lunches on weekends but it didn\'t say weekdays only; we found out when we got there.
