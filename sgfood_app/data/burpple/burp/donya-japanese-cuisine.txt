Had an excellent katsudon at this store. It\'s really like the ones I\'ve had studying in Japan. What\'s more the Prive is really good. Will return for this definitely! Won\'t mind more side dishes such as chawamushi or tsukemono ‚ò∫Ô∏è
These guys at Donya set out to offer Japanese food at lower prices and we felt they did so with some decent dishes. Do not expect sophisticated cooking but you do still get some updated flavours with their aburi mentaiko salmon on Don or sushi rolls. Overall, a meal to satisfy the tummy but not necessarily the palate.
Amazing and value for money! You just have to try it for yourself:)
From Donya Japanese Cuisine situated within a coffeeshop at Blk 126 Toa Payoh Lorong 1; the block just beside the market that houses Chey Sua Carrot Cake and just a short walk away from Creamier (yes, I am just saying it\'s like an all-in-one package whenever I am here). Serving up affordable Japanese fare and \"near-restaurant\" quality, expect rice bowls typical of what is usually served in Japanese stalls at coffeeshops and a few Maki dishes.
2 pax nice dinner. Trying their #SalmonMentaiDon (deep-fried Norwegian Sashimi Grade Salmon, slathered with mentai cream) and #UnagiTamaDon (loved this nicely grilled delicious Unagi) each at SGD8.80 per bowl recommended by my buddy Henry Wong. It was yummy indeed. Most of their dishes are priced from SGD5.80 to SGD9.80 #donyasingapore #donyamaki #japanesecuisine #donya #burpple #qualityjapfood #tpy126 #126ToaPayoh #ToaPayohLor1 #AffordableJapaneseFoodSg @donyasingapore These posts are non sponsored products where no incentives or financial gains are given. #olympusOmdEm10 #MZuikoED14to150mmLens #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #burpple #burpplesg\n<br />Donya Singapore Japanese Cuisine, (former Cathay Kopitiam now Chang Cheng Mee Wah) 126 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 #1-577, Toa Payoh, Singapore 310126 Opens Daily: 11am - 2.30pm and 5.00pm - 9.00 pm.
