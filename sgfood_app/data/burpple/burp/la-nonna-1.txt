Although the venue doesn\'t explicitly say it\'s like a chili crab pasta, it felt like it. They even offer you a spoon to scoop up every bit of the sauce if you desire!
Not exactly what you\'ll get from Naples, Italy. But you can\'t complain especially if you got the entertainer app that offers 1-for-1 mains.
I enjoyed the homemade pappardelle. It\'s really light! It went very well with the oxtail ragu. La nonna offers valuable sets for both weekdays and weekends. Pro-tip: check their chalkboard before ordering!

Pleasant brunch experience at La Nonna\'s. Their 1-for-1 lunch deal is an absolute steal. Besides a main/pizza/pasta, you will be presented with their unique italian breadsticks/bread buns as appetizers. Loved the piping hot soft bread dipped in their balsamic vinegar and olive oil mix. :) Their La Nonna pizza had the perfect crust topped with a generous amount of truffle, cheese and asparagus. Being a cheese lover, I requested to add on more buffulo mozzarella and the melted cheese totally bumped up the taste of the thin-crusted pizza. The golden yolk that oozed out of the egg added more flavour to the pizza and it was an interesting twist to our original perception of pizzas. Would definitely recommend this place üëç
I love thin crust pizzas and they have a wonderful lunch 1 for 1 pizza/pasta/mains promotion from Monday to Friday! Don\'t say bo jio üòÑ
Sauce was lacking in crustacean taste, not thick enough. Cook on the pasta was okay. Crabmeat was chunky, perhaps the only saving grace for the dish. 
This is tough to decide, but I liked the Panna Cotta best ‚Äì an egg-less vanilla custard cream served with fresh berry coulis.
This is the \"Family Brunch at La Nonna‚Äù Holland V, where groups can feast on FREE-FLOW All-you-can-eat Italian dishes from antipasti, pasta, pizza, mains and desserts. Serious.
FINALLY went to some place that isn\'t home, school or church. Life has been lacking. üò≠ Treated myself to a good hearty lunch at La Nonna today where I had one of my usuals. The very flavourful and robust ragout which is made extra nutty and creamy by the addition of parmesan is true comfort food. Well worth the food coma afterwards ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
Nice homely Italian grandma cooking that comforts the stomach. Slightly eggy pasta but I polished it up anyway.
The saltiness from the smoked salmon, mild fragrance of mascarpone and mozzarella, slightly bitter Rucola salad and fresh crisp pizza crust is perfect. Salmon tasted rather fresh and wasn\'t too salty. Eat this while it\'s hot! The steam will make the pizza soggy and cook the salmon. 
The pizzas here are delish as usual. A generous portion of smoke salmon was given, which was balanced out by the mascarpone cheese so it wasn\'t too gelat. The rucola salad was fresh and crisp and made the dish less heavy overall. Not a fan of the capers, though others may like how it goes with the salmon. A good alternative to their signature pizza if you want to try something different. Priced at $23. 
Minced lobster meat in the pasta, feel that lobster meat is best enjoyed whole, so this was a downer. But the meat is well marinated with herbs. The sauce is rich and marvellous, with a slight kick. Pasta was a bit below al dente, which made it taste like reheated undercooked pasta. 
It was disappointingly so-so. Although you may expect it to be the usual salty kind of sauce, it was oddly tomato-based. Tasted merely like a squid-ink colored seafood marinara. On the plus side, they were very generous with their seafood (fish, squid, prawns) that was very fresh. But overall it fell flat of any expectations. 
Always.\" That\'s my verdict for La Nonna\'s crabmeat linguine üòäüòäüòä
Tried La Nonna\'s for the very first time and decided to follow the waiter\'s recommendation of Linguine (Crab meat sauce). It was definitely something I haven\'t tried before! Service was really good especially cos\' I broke a glass by accident and they were kind enough and assured me it was fine:)
Sorbet is so sour, they type the wife likes. A tad too sour for me. üòÇ
Lobster Ravioli with Arrabbiata sauce. This is one of the best ravioli I\'ve had, it was wrapped up with fine quality lobster and it\'s a total of goodness one bite after another. 
The name says it all: La Nonna translates to \"the grandmother\". Set in a cozy space, this restaurant is unpretentious and serves up hearty Italian fare. Their signature, the La Nonna pizza, stands out for all the right reasons. Black truffle, asparagus and an egg sit atop a delightfully thin crust. You won\'t stop swooning over how good this is.   
I will always come back when I crave for some linguine üòä
1 for 1 thanks t the entertainer app!

Thin-crust pizza topped with asparagus, black truffle and an egg. Surprisingly delicious yet light!
1-for-1 a la carte for lunch. A colleague remarked how discreet they are about this.
This is handmade pasta in a robust, tomato-based oxtail ragout. The chunks of beef have been stewed till they\'re so tender and melty that they simply fall apart. Flavours that warm your soul :\')
had the daily special, ravioli with crabmeat and lobster, and tiramisu paired with a glass of rose wine
This is my favorite pizza yet. The crust is baked in a wood-fired oven, yielding a delicious smoky base that is thin and crisp, yet still pretty substantial. It is covered in a pomodoro sauce, and topped generously with asparagus, mozzarella and minced truffle, and finished off with a runny egg. Mmm...The smell of truffle in this pizza is intoxicating. Plus you get 50% off all mains during lunch time on weekdays at the Holland V outlet.
Signature pizza here: tomato-based pizza with asparagus, Parmesan, mozzarella, black truffle and egg. Why bother ordering anything else?
Awesome food
Ordered the linguine to go with the 1-for-1 lunch deal. Did not regret it one bit! Filled with the richness of the sauce and abundance of crabmeat. Definitely will order this again! :)
If you have \"grandma\" in your restaurant name you better deliver on the tiramisu and that they definitely did. Very light alcohol taste which was perfect for those who can\'t take alcohol. Otherwise it was just flawlessly executed. Just when I thought I cannot eat anymore, I promptly finished this plate in a minute and called for another one cos thats how good it was. The fruits on top  were unnecessary imo because the mascaporne cheese was already very light and the fruits were too sour
The sauce was very creamy and the bacon were umami bombs. If only there was more bacon it would have been perfect
Tbh not very impressive. Rather oily and not very spicy at all. Needs more oomph

I will definitely mop up all the sauce again
Price:~$27. La nonna is a small restaurant located at holland V and it sells authentic looking Italian dishes including this risotto. The average price per dish is about $25 and so it is on the steep side. However, if you were to visit on the weekdays for lunch, there\'s the one for one deal which makes it all so worth it! (This 1-for-1 deal is quite a well-kept secret though because not many people know of it)
Honestly I\'d rather have the pasta, the lobster ravioli is freaking awesome.. The steak is tender and juicy but lacks the taste of beef.. And the sauce just kills it even more..but hey.. This is a free meal :) Anything tomato based is fab in lanonna. Go for that instead
However, I do feel that the black pepper has masked the flavor of the lamb
Squid ink pizza bursting in flavour with scallops, squid, prawns and cherry tomatoes though it was a little charred. ($23.90)
Squid was a little rubbery, but the seafood was generous and fresh. The squid ink-tomato sauce was really tasty!

An absolute delight.
The cheese is fresh and creamy, but the pesto a little weak. But overall a delightful starter. Even the side salad is nicely dressed.

The Manzo is a ribeye drizzled with a black truffle sauce, served with roasted potatoes, a salad dressed in balsamic vinaigrette and steamed broccoli. I had the steak cooked medium, and it was really tender and juicy. It does not have much of a charred exterior, which I appreciate cause...carcinogens, but if you like that smokiness, this probably won\'t satiate you. The creamy, truffled sauce was extra decadent and yummy. Thanks to the 1-for-1 lunch promo, my delicious lunch came up to only $21 after tax and extra charges. So yummy and affordable!
Love the skin really crisp and the balsamic reduction. #lanonna #sgfood #sgfoodie #italianfood #merluzzo
