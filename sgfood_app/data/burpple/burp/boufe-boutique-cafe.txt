White bright cafe, which is pretty secluded.
[Boufe Boutique Cafe]\n<br />.\n<br />Starting off the weekend vibes with these aesthetic cakes from Boufe Sg! Indeed artistic with unexpected layers of sweetness it in!. Cakes served was a little sweet! But it was acceptable! Sponge cake inside the inner layer was really well textured! Overall design of the cake was definitely appealing, taste was well balance with the ingredients in the cake itself! Atmosphere was relaxing! Overall experience was good! Love this place!
This cake came to me as a lovely surprise - it tasted as good as it looked on the outside 💕soft and delicate! I die for any sort of biscuit crunch at the bottom of cakes lah ah sOoo this is a must-eat-again for me. ❤️😵❤️😵
Another Chef\'s Recommendation dessert. Made from white chocolate yoghurt mousse, honey genoise, chocolate sable and calamansi jelly. My only gripe was that the cake could\'ve been bigger 😂
This is listed under Chef\'s Recommendation in their menu. Made with coconut mousse, mango cremeux, vanilla sponge and white chocolate horn &amp; ears. Very instagram worthy dessert which tastes as good as it looks!
Bringing on the unicorns 🦄🦄🦄 for @beaverwoo who\'s ready to pop 🍿🍿🍿 Geddit geddit? Can\'t miss the galaxy cakes here in the form of Milky Way ($8.50) Brunch here was pretty decent, vv filling and instagrammable yay! Grilled Mexican Corn is so good I could have like 5 #babyK #itsaboy #duh #burpple #dqky 💙
Would appreciate if this cake would be cheaper.. they call this the mini unicorn cake and it\'s priced at $9. The taste is not that fantastic though, but the cute exterior makes up for it. Absolutely instagram worthy!
Australian beef (if I recall correctly it was around 150g) sandwiched between hash brown and onion rings. There was a 15-20min wait time for this item. One of the chef\'s recommendation. I\'m not used to pairing beef with hash brown and onion rings and thought the combination was rather strange.
Refreshing twist to the usual eggs benny served with ham or smoked salmon. Menu says it\'s served with chipotle sauce, but it tasted very oriental, exactly like the canned spiced pork cubes you get at supermarkets omg. 
Does not look it, but this dish is HUGE. 3 pieces of fish accompanied with very generous serving of fries with avocado mash and salad on the side. 
.\n<br />Interesting mango twist to the Unicorn cake and citrus flavour to the Milky Way.
Always love a hearty brunch and this is no exception! The scramble eggs were rich and creamy, sausages juicy and mushroom yummy! Thumbs up! 
Never did I expect to be able to try this cake so soon in SG when I just saw this technique online.. :) very pretty cake whose sweetness is balanced by the tangy bits in the middle :)
Smooth and robust latte
Experience here was bad. It was not even peak hours and the waiters were just standing around while we waited half an hour for our food and turns out that our order was not even placed.\n<br />The food was average and not worth for all that wait. The duck confit was tough and was not well-cooked, the only saving grace were the cakes which we ended up taking away since lunch hour was over already.
Genuinely adore the cakes here, unlike typical gimmicks elsewhere, they actually taste beautiful inside out. Need more friends who love coconut though.\n<br />.\n<br />Happy Mother\'s Day to all the superwomen with the most difficult job in the world. May your day be filled with fairy dusts &amp; glitters! Psst .. The unicorn made me do it 🦄
This dish was about $15-16 if I\'m not wrong. The cream taste was really a little too overwhelming and there was only a subtle hint of the mushroom taste. Was pretty disappointed ): 
🦄\n<br />This time round I will not spoil your surprise by revealing how the cake will taste or look like inside. Don\'t worry, it taste good 😋\n<br />🦄\n<br />Good night!\n<br />🦄\n<br />Where to find this? \n<br />Boufe @boufesg\n<br />📍\n<br />308 Tanglin Road, Phoenix Park, L1-01, S247974\n<br />⏰\n<br />Mon to Fri: 8am to 7pm, Sat/Sun: 9am to 7pm\n<br />💰\n<br />S$9+\n<br />.\n<br />#freewifisg
🌌 \n<br />Okay, I supposed many have already tried at least one galaxy cake. But since not all galaxy cakes are the same (this one is called milkyway), swipe to see how @boufesg \'s version looks like beneath its mysterious glaze!\n<br />🌌 \n<br />Contrary to what I had assumed (that pretty cakes are not yummy), this one has both the looks and the taste. The combination of white chocolate mousse, honey genoise (sponge cake) and calamansi jelly on a chocolate stable cookie is just perfect. There\'s a good balance between sweet and sour flavours and an interesting mix of soft and hard textures. I will come back for this again.\n<br />🌌\n<br />Good Night!

I had the brioche bread in my eggs benedict ($16++) changed to sourdough because I felt that a firmer bread can soak up the runny yolk better without getting too soggy. Bf accidentally ordered 4 sunny side ups for himself 😂😂 with his truffle house breakfast ($16++). Overall I enjoyed this cafe. It had lots of good natural lighting and a nice mish mash of non similar white/grey furniture.
What a pretty cake! Scroll to left to see a photo of the inside of this cake. I think I had more fun trying to guess what kind of cake it was inside its glossy facade. It was a very tangy (a little too sour for me) fruit cake. Looked prettier than it tasted unfortunately. But still a nice experience as I never had such a cake before.
Still loving how good the food here is. Two thumbs up for their Eggs Ben and Smoked Salmon Scrambled Eggs Croissant 🤗 yay to an awesome Saturday!
Salted egg crayfish pasta was unique and tasted okay! Loved the magical drink which changed colour from blue to purple and the milky way cake!!! Super pretty 😍 #BurppleXChope
This afternoon, I explored new frontiers of taste with the \"Milky Way\", a new and very striking looking cake on Boufe\'s Christmas 2016 menu.\n<br />Designed to resemble a giant capsule, it tastes pleasantly light due to airy white chocolate yogurt mousse and honey génoise sponge cake being its key components. The wedge of calamansi jelly tucked within and crunchy chocolate sablé base deliver the excitement of a sour note and crunchiness respectively.
Salad with a tangy citrusy sauce and bits of smoked salmon, cranberries, raisins and a huge chunk of avocado. Really filling and nice!
how do one resist a table full of carb when it\'s packed with truffles or salted egg yolk crayfish? not me for sure. the shoe string truffle fries were crispy and on point, and you could smell and taste the truffle, so good 😋. the pasta were nicely done, perhaps a little on the dry side, but they were generous with the crayfish and you literally get the whole salted egg yolk on your dish. what more can i say? 👍🏼
A quaint place to chillax &amp; eat brunch.\n<br />They make their own breads🍞...pretty wholesome &amp; awesome🙄
Yah look at the name of this dish you think it should be a zi char dish mah. But what is it doing in a cafe leh? Hehe... It\'s an item in Boufe brunch menu. It\'s salted egg crayfish on toast but it tastes far from your zi char. Nicely done not too eggy and the salted egg sauce tastes so good when soaked into the soft fluffy think toast. Try it and you know it. Btw Boufe brunch items are available all day daily (till 6pm) so you can drop by anytime 👌🏼 #saltedeggcrayfishonbread\n<br />#chinesefusiontoangmohjiak
Just a good egg Ben and a nice cuppa are all I need to start the weekend. The Egg Ben from Boufe is done simply and so perfectly yummy from the poached eggs, toast to the hollandise sauce. Very nice! Love it with the salted caramel latte! Oh my Saturday is off to a good start! Swee lah! 👍🏼
Always look on the sunny side with Eggs Benedict [$16] and Triple B [$21], along with my caffeine. This sums up our hearty meal before \'work\' over the weekend. 
The onions added a raw and jarring pungency to the salted egg yolk proceedings, with the marriage having as much harmony and zen as a Thursday Meet-The-People session. Elsewhere, the mooncake-like whole yolk felt like both an affectionate love letter as well as a self-aware \"LOL now you can\'t kaopeh there\'s too little yolk taste\" middle finger to intensity-seeking yolkers. 3.3/5
\n🍰\n<br />Desserts are definitely where their strength lies!\n<br />🍰\n<br />Tried their Mille Feuille, Honey Granola Greek Yoghurt and Daisy Cake and all were outstandingly delicious!\n<br />🍰\n<br />Featured: Daisy Cake (Green Tea Financier, Yuzu Cremeux, Lychee Mousse)
Brunch with my teammates! 🙌🏼 I decided to try Scotch Egg Guacamole ($19), since I\'ve been enjoying guacamole quite a bit lately. It consisted of Scotch eggs, homemade Guacamole spread on Sesame Rye bread, greek yogurt, and salad. I didn\'t know what Scotch eggs were (I hope I\'m not the only one!), and I was surprised when the dish came. Eggs surrounded with breaded crust! I\'ve never tried eggs made this way before and honestly it was really good. I could do without the greek yogurt though.\n<br />Read my full review on my blog! www.foodwithnic.wordpress.com 
$11 for a plate of sin. Fantastic and flavourful minced beef that was unfortunately drowned by a pretty mediocre pool of nacho cheese. 
Possibly my favorite French toast in Singapore!! Fluffy and airy and not too sweet ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ also I\'m not usually a fan of whipped cream but the one they served with this French toast was so light~~~ AND I always love a good crumble. Conclusion: Gr8 mix of textures !!
The Hello Kitty Drink (\"HKD\") of choice for all fellow aspiring mixologists as well as pipette-loving and litmus-testing chemical brothers out there. (For those who want a naughty alcoholic variant, there\'s Manhattan Bar\'s \"Aviation\" cocktail.)
Situated within the hilly area of Phoenix Park in Tanglin, this sun-lit, minimalist space is shared between a cafe and boutique. The latter stocks a selection of curated accessories and knick knacks, while the cafe serves delicious brunch grub. Its quiet, charming ambience makes it the perfect spot for a late morning date. On a breezy day, opt to sit alfresco at their wooden patio to be surrounded by lush greenery as you dine. Like many Burpplers, we like the Triple B ($21), a big breakfast that sees scrambled eggs, sausages, sauteed mushrooms, honey-glazed bacon, fresh greens and a housemade miniature croissant, all heaped on a plate. The Smoked Salmon Croissant ($19) is tasty too, and served with a generous pile of fresh greens on the side. Note that the croissant is sliced into thick chunks that make them more manageable to eat with your eggs and salmon. We\'ll skip the underwhelming coffee and go for the refreshing Ice Lychee Tea ($5.50) instead. Pro-tip: Unless you have a car, the uphill walk to Boufe will take you 15 minutes from the nearest bus stop. Consider cabbing in to avoid getting all sweaty on your date.
Not much variety. Food was alright only. The drink looks pretty cool, taste like some kind of tea that\'s all.
Boufe seems to have made its mark as one of the best brunch spots, but my friend and I thought the standard will be congruent for dinner.\n<br />The duck skin edges were crispy, the meat was disappointingly dry and a little too gamey. The mash fluff underneath was smooth and buttery, and the sauce resembled a less milky beurre blanc rather than orange sauce as stated in the menu - tasted more lemony... Not an impressive duck confit I\'m afraid, though I count myself lucky to have ordered this compared to my friend\'s beef steak sourdough (pathetic portion of beef slices).\n<br />This place is a gem - stands out in the day with the white furnishings enlivening the space, but unremarkable when night falls into darkness.
The cafe was packed when we arrived around 2pm. After a short wait, we were invited to be seated. Menu was short and sweet. Prices are quite to the average side, it probably won\'t burn a hole in your wallet. I ordered the Eggs Florotine ($18) with comes like 2 eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and spinach on toast, garnished with Brussels sprouts. The matcha latte iced ($6) , was not too sweet yet wholesome. We also ordered the Chocolate tart ($8?), the chocolate was damn good, with caramel with a hint of lemon in the centre, the crust, a chocolaty biscuit kind - both crunchy and fresh. We also ordered the breakfast set ($21), which came with 2 large sausages, scrambled eggs, bacon (tastes like bakwa), and a mini salad. Food came fast and service was sweet and commendable. Pro Tip: The walk to the cafe is quite a distance from the gate. It\'s located at block 302 of the compound. 
Its a pretty chilly &amp; nice place to just sit &amp; rot &amp; talk. Egg bens tasted not bad too! But abit pricey  I would say. But the presentation was really on point! Saw this soft shell crab (??) looking dish too! Looking forward to go back &amp; try it 
Call it ambience, feel or vibe, this cafe with its lustrous monochromatic scheme of black and white is what I needed to perk up my breakfast meeting and get the brain working in the morning. Sometimes, it\'s really not about the food and coffee anymore. 
$18 + $2.50 (half an avocado) // the croissants were sliced and toasted, thus made easy to eat. If you love really soft scramble egg, you would definitely like this! 
Nestled within Phoenix Park, Boufé Boutique Cafe is both quiet and charming, making it the perfect brunch spot for you and your date to get away from the city. The light-filled space combines a cafe and boutique under one roof, so you can fill your tummies before wandering around the selection of curated accessories and knick knacks. If weather permits, sit outdoors and sip on their homemade Ice Lychee Tea ($5.50) while taking in the lush surroundings. The Brioche French Toast ($19), homemade brioche topped with fresh berries, caramelised banana, almond crumble, drizzled with maple syrup and topped with light-as-air whipped cream, is very popular among the ladies. To feed ravenous male appetites, order the popular Triple B ($21), Boufé’s big breakfast that comes with a freshly baked miniature croissant, scrambled eggs, sausages, sautéed mushrooms, honey-glazed bacon and a generous amount of fresh greens. End your brunch date on a sweet note with Boufé\'s famed Strawberry Shortcake ($8), or the Citron Tart ($5.50) if you prefer something zestier. Wash it all down with a cup of aromatic Flat White ($5). 
The food was deliciousss and the price was fairly reasonable. There is a separate menu for the afternoon and evening timing so u might want to check before u come! The view,decorations and furniture there is really pretty so its nice to take photos. The ambience there is great too,quiet and suitable if u want some alone time or catchup with friends!
Dragonfruit toast sandwiched with sliced ham, cucumber, roquette leaves, mango chutney and over easy egg. Served with fries. Abit trying too hard to impress I feel. Can\'t really taste the concept of this dish. Too many flavors that don\'t really compliment each other. Pretty instaworthy though. 龍果土司的配料太複雜了。有些時候，秘方與菜料簡單反而更妙！
Brunch is always a good idea hence for New Year we travelled to, slightly out-of-the-way, Boufe Boutique café located within Phoenix Park along Tanglin Road. As my first visit, the place left a strong impression with its lovely café interior and al fresco area (yay to good lighting) but more memorable is of us getting very lost in the rain. My friends shared The Triple B that came with a little of everything on a single plate - croissant, luscious scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, well-seasoned sautéed mushroom and salad. However the unanimous favourite was the Brioche French Toast ($19) I ordered - Thick pillowy homemade brioche in French toast mix, topped with fresh berries, caramelised banana, almond crumble, maple syrup and delectable cream chantilly which strangely remind me of deconstructed strawberry shortcake. Overall their brunch menu is promising and pleasing.
I LOVE their freshly baked croissants, buttery soft on the inside but nice and crisp on the outside 😻😻😻So imagine how happy I was when I found out that my Triple B ($21) - that\'s Boufe\'s Big Breakfast - came with a miniature croissant! 😊😊😊😊😊 We also ordered the Smoked Salmon Croissant ($19) because one can never have enough croissants for brunch. NEVER. #burpple
Boufe is situated way out of Tanglin which does not really have any big crowds at night (I was there yesterday for Christmas!) it was really cozy like a little western house celebrating christmas! The food and service was prompt &amp; not to mention, famous instagrammer pxdkitty is a staff there as well! This plate of prawn aglio olio blew our minds as the linguine was done al dente, the prawns were crunchy &amp; the sauce had the tinge of white wine 😋
The signauture Boufe cake of this cafe! Plentiful amount of chocolate glossed over the entire cake simply makes u hangry at first sight! Inside contains chocolate mousse infused with a passion fruit mango centre. The concoction is simple yet pleasing even to the fussiest food connoisseur. Well done! 不肥蛋糕是這家店裡的招牌甜點！蛋糕裡的巧克力慕斯以及百香果的中心搭配得令人匪夷所思! 贊！
Thought the plating of this dish was a tad overdone; styled smoked salmon sitting atop a bed of scrambled eggs and cut up croissant flanked with leafy greens that covers off the whole plate; wished if it could come more ordinary that might actually make it look more palatable? Look past the excessive plating and this was not too bad; creamy scrambled eggs with flaky, light and buttery croissant and fresh and savoury cured salmon with capers. Not a bad option for weekend brunch.
Fresh roquette leaves, Japanese cucumber, Mango chutney, Ham slices, Over easy egg, Dragon Fruit Toast. Apart from the pinkish looks, the bread felt rather ordinary in terms of flavour like any other with a light and fluffy texture. The mango chutney gave the sandwich a rather interesting Indian twist, while the other elements made this a rather safe choice similar to a Club Sandwich. Fries were crisp, coming with a whiff of truffle from truffle oil.
Essentially a crossover project between Coco Ichibanya\'s Lv. 1 curry and mee rebus. The seafood portion was happily generous, and the roasty-soft eggplant a welcome guest. 3.9/5
Eggs Benedict ($16) and Brioche French Toast with caramelised bananas! This was absolutely amazing. The brioche on both the Eggs Ben and French toast were fluffy, warm and delicious!!! A 100/100. There was meringue sprinkled over the French toast, and the chantilly cream was perfectly light and milky - like how a good chantilly would taste. Would definitely go back x100 times.
Ordered the truffle avocado and truffle fries! Hmm a little disappointing 🤔
When we ordered smoked salmon croissant, I was expecting it to be a closed sandwich style and not an open face sandwich. Brioche French toast is totally flawless! Perfectly cooked fluffy brioche French toast seated on a bed of crumbled crumb, garnished with fresh berries and topped with caramelised banana. With freshly whipped cream and finally dusted with snow powder! So appealing to sight and hits the home run when it tasted as good as it looks! Triple B breakfast is good too. Sautéed mushrooms perfectly seasoned, scramble eggs is cooked skilfully and those bacons are so addictive!! I wish the croissant is bigger though I know very well there\'s consideration of food cost. Haha! This is a place I wouldn\'t mind going back again for brunch!
Big breakfast. $21. Croissant, scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, sautéed mushroom, salad. 
$13. Nachos cheese with minced beef and fries. Spicy level is probably 3/5. Portion is good for 3-4 pax. 
But really very good food is hard to find. Boufe serves pretty decent food for the price you pay. Not the best, but relatively slightly better brunch around. 5 of us shared 4 mains, 3 desserts and 5 drinks. And it\'s about $27 per person. I was happy when I pay the bill. Some places, the food don\'t even justify the price I pay. I\'m particular about the food I put in my mouth especially I\'m a chef by profession. #chefproblems #boufe #boufesg #boufeboutiquecafe #menu #art
Thick homemade brioche in French milk sauce, topped with fresh berries, caramelised banana, cream chantilly, almond crumble and maple syrup.
Saw the artistic signature Boufe Cake ($8.50) and decided that I must have that for dessert! Was enjoying the smooth bittersweet mousse which had hazelnut nougatine in it till we came to the center when the acidity from the passionfruit mango cremeux woke us up. It was too sour for the boyfriend. 😂
Brunch with my favourite people at this very gorgeous cafe😍 food was pretty decent and the place is lovely, good place for a date or meet up with girlfriends. But for this price I might be a little hesitant (although there\'s no service charge), and come here only for an occasionally treat. Not for the coffee though, mocha didn\'t impress. Additionally, it\'s a little long walk from the MRT, thank goodness we drove!
Other than the lovely indoor space with clean white spaces, the al fresco area at Boufe is absolutely pretty - it\'s a little small but I can totally imagine having a wedding/birthday party here.

D had Triple B (in the background) | Satur-date cafe hopping with @hydez7 ❤ #burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders
Toast is great, served with caramelised sliced banana, cream, berries and maple syrup! I had it with Berry Tea. (I don\'t drink coffee) 
Fruity, not so sweet and refreshing. I did tried this with a strawberry shortcake! 
- Truffle house avocado [$18]: Generous portion of mushroom piled on top of crispy baguette. Delicious and creaminess reminded me of mushroom soup! My only gripe is that the avocado wasn\'t ripe and was rather hard to poke through with a fork 
Truffle fries were great; croissant, not so much. I highly recommend that iced drink of lemonade-infused cucumber and strawberry water – soooooooo cooling and refreshing, especially in the crazy hot weather we\'ve been having lately.
yep fries drizzled with a generous portion of truffle oil, completed with cheese and some greens. \n<br />truffle has been a mainstay in many dishes here on our sunny island. what\'s the best dish to accompany truffle with in your opinion?
Whopping portion of brioche blanketed with slices of smoked salmon, which also conceal the spinach that is typical of eggs Florentine. Two perfectly poached eggs lounge comfortably on the soft folds of salmon; with a stroke of my knife, their molten yolks descend in a flood of bright yellow that looks oh-so-pretty against the backdrop of rumpled coral fish. I liked the addition of capers, whose piquant sour-salty flavour cut through the richness of the hollandaise nicely, though I could have done with a little less of the wiry alfalfa sprouts.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 not really a fan of cakes but these were good 😍
😜 bacon was pretty good (caramelised like charsiew), likewise for the bratwursts. 👍🏼
Today\'s brunch situation. Free macarons because they mixed up the plating of some of the orders. It didn\'t really bother us, but good save on their part!
吃brunch就是追求这个~ 😂 their homemade brioche is so good! same goes for their croissant heheh #burpple
#TGIF Here\'s {Duck Confit with mashed potato} from @boufesg. I got this from the @sugar_singapore app which makes it even better! ✌️\n<br />The mash was a tad too dry and it would be perfect if the skin was crispy 😋 Nevertheless, we had a good time because company &gt; food. #boufesg
Would have liked the French toast to be better cooked through. Was a bit soggy inside. 
Situated at quite an ulu location in the town area (orchard), it requires some walking and gps effort to reach the cafe 😅 Went early on a weekday and we were the only customers there. But of course, crazier crowds on weekends which we were lucky to avoid this time. The cafe white interior is really pretty, and there is also a boutique shop in a corner of the cafe. Ambience was great (especially when there wasn\'t any other customers and we had the whole place to ourselves) Service staff was friendly and service was prompt too. Food was good, I feel, especially the french toast, moist (not the harder kind which I don\'t really fancy) and not too sweet!😍 Items featured im the photo includes: Triple B $21/Smoked Salmon Crossiant $19/Brioche French Toast $14/Truffle Fries $13/Iced Mocha $6.50. Total bill sums up to $70++ for 2 pax. Verdict: The food is good, arguably mediocre with its higher price tags. But still worth at least a trip to have a try of their food! 3.70/5.0
Classic strawberry shortcake, with a tinge of some alcohol. Not too overpowering, and very light. Decently priced at $8, but I felt the sponge was a tad too wet (prolly cos of the alcohol). Overall, great tasting dessert.
Had some desserts after a good dinner at Boufe. The lemon meringue tart looks so pretty but was a little too sour for my liking. Crust and lemon curd texture was good. The salted caramel macarons tasted mostly of sweet caramel but not salted enough. Great service crew!
Crispy skin and tender flesh but there was too little meat on the duck leg. Mash potato had a nice texture and the consisteny of the sauce was really good. Not filling enough but means I can have stomach for desserts! 
Very tender beef in red wine sauce! Bread sticks were toasted nicely and fragrant! Very satisfying meaty dish! 
Just like a normal egg benedict, nothing\'s special. At least the place is very cozy
Boufe - part boutique, part cafe. Predictably crowded on a Saturday morning and very noisy. Grub was alright, predictable with the usual brunch offerings (methinks Melbourne has spoilt me for brunch forever). 
The weather made me so lethargic that I think I down with at least a couple cups of coffee
Their iced chocolate was not rich enough, perhaps they didn\'t use really good quality cocoa powder. Go for their coffee if you visit them, not the best coffee but definitely better than their iced chocolate.
They have an indoor area which are white minimalist design as well as a outdoor garden feel patio. Here\'s the Egg Benedict ($16), French Toast ($14), Truffle fries ($13) with Hot Mocha ($5.50) and Iced Chocolate ($6.50) for you.
Nutty, moist and sweet. A little pity the taste of coffee was too mild. 
I hope I\'m wrong but these taste just like the frozen ones sold in supermarkets 😐
More bitter than sweet, this is the kind of mocha that I can appreciate :)
lovely ambience. beautiful interior deco. but quite ulu\n<br />sadly the eggs were overdone today. no yolk flowing out to coat the bread.
Yes, Boufé is on SUGAR app too. \n<br />I didn\'t really like it as it was too dry and mashed potato wasn\'t creamy enough. I ordered their pastries and coffee too which tasted pretty good. I heard good reviews on their brunch menu too!\n<br />•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•=•\n<br />Btw, you can spend your weekends at Pasarbella Gourmet Hop at The Grandstand today and tomorrow from 1pm to 10pm.

Spent my Saturday with my cellies exploring foreign land. Pretty decent brunch at a white-out venue! 
Situated within Phoenix Park in the Tanglin area, Boufe (the word a portmanteau of \"boutique\" and \"cafe\") Boutique Cafe shares a space with Ohvola boutique. The usual brunch fare such as Eggs Benedict, Brioche French Toast and Croque Madame are served, but you should really try Boufe\'s Big Breakfast or \"Triple B\" ($21). Creamy scrambled eggs, sauteed mushrooms, bacon, sausages and a freshly baked buttery croissant — not a bad way to start your day at all.They serve fantastic pastries as well, of which the Strawberry Shortcake ($8) and Citron Tart ($5.50) stand out. Given the quality of the food and the killer combination of spaciousness, chic decor and warm ambience, this place will only become more popular with time.
Love the ambience here! Menu was rather limited but had interesting dishes such as the truffle mushroom toast. The big breakfast is definitely one of the most visually-appealing and quality ones out there 🌟🌟🌟🌟
I loved the scrambled eggs. if there was a way I like eggs to be done, it would be this. \n<br />happy Thursday yall!
A place to shop and eat. Love the all-white environment. 
Its breakfast time. Hope you had a great breakfast to start the day off!! 😄
loved how that egg works well on top. \n<br />seems like it\'s already Friday! finally a break in sight.
Opened since January this year, Boufe, with its sun-lit minimalist interior, has very quickly become a hit among cafe-hoppers for capturing perfect shots. Situated within Phoenix Park in the Tanglin area, this cafe serves hearty brunch fare like the usual big breakfast (the Triple B), Eggs Benedict, French Toast, and classic Croque Madame. Go for the Truffle House-baked Baguette -- a delicious combination of crisp baguette with an earthy truffle mushroom ragout, egg and fresh greens -- it is so worth getting out of bed for! They also offer a range of pastries and desserts to be enjoyed with a cup of coffee. This is the kind of spot to enjoy some \"me\" time, the serenity certainly calms you.
yes, still being very anal about yesterday\'s missed brunch, hence here early in de morning. found an unmonochromed set and vola. \n<br />food was mehhh despite the price, took a rather long time to arrive too. nonetheless, away from the ruckus of the city chilling with greenery.
Their black-n-white theme setting attracts me from the outside and warms me inside.
I\'m falling in love with the Macarons ... Not too sweet ... 
Pretty good brunch menu with reasonable prices~ need more cafe buddies so that I can try the other items, heheh. \n<br />The entire cafe setting is in mainly white colour with lots of natural lighting - my dream space! ♡♡♡
Here to enjoy some instagram worthy moments, free parking &amp; the minimalist white decor.  On a side unrelated note,happy to report my Sally Hansen miracle gel painted nails performed much better than any normal nail polish.showing signs of wear only after the 4th day. This is day 18 for my blue polish.
Another new brunch spot, Boufe Boutique Cafe. More details on the blog. Link in bio ☕️
Although being as visually appealing as a slice of Gardenia bread, the Chinese-esque aglio olio packs a secret taste punch with its fragrance and strong Hokkien Mee-esque flavour. The spicy chilli oil whacks hard - I asked for super spicy and they delivered competently without playing the predictable chilli padi card. 3.6/5
Trying this new on the menu crab pasta, was pretty decent, satisfying all the taste it needs. Bit of spicy, tangy and some bitterness from the rocket leaves. However, probably needs a few more twitching.
Pretty decent, cream was lightly sweet and has the fragrant milk taste! Liked it overall but the strawberries were kinda too hard for the cake.
Happy Sunday to all!! Have not been posting Eggs Benedict for quite some time, so here\'s one! 😄
We had the usual essential brunch items, Eggs Benedict and Triple B. Brioche french toast on the other hand were pretty good, soft &amp; fluffy 😋 Coffee not bad either.
Glossy chocolate surface with crunchy texture contrast against the smooth velvety filling, then garnished with icing sugar, silver foil and fresh berries gives this dessert tart a luxurious touch. I would prefer sea salt sprinkling onto the chocolate tart, instead of icing sugar. Having said that, it is still a pretty good dessert.
Had to try this because Boufe bakes their own tarts; something cafés don\'t usually do these days. The torched meringue adds the lightly sweet marshmallow-like sweetness to the citron curd which is nicely tart yet sweet, trapped in a buttery tart base that crumbles without causing a mess. Something that opens up the appetite even after a pretty filling brunch!
Looks kinda huge because there were two layers of rather thick bread sandwiching the ham and cheese within. The ham is rather premium here, thickly cut and in generous portions coated with cheese and yet another layer of gratin cheese on the sandwich that was really similar to having a pizza. Cut the sunny side-up to reveal flowy sunshine goodness that drenched the bread. Mesculun salad was fresh with adequate amounts of dressing. Was rather manageable despite its mammoth portion; bread was rather soft and light, though it could also be me not having proper meals for the past few days?
Honestly if not for my friend ordering this dish I would have went straight for it! The baguette in this dish is baked in-house, which is crisp and crunchy and smothered with a good amount of truffle mushroom ragout which had short hints of truffle goodness within the earthy, creamy flavour. Hard boiled egg actually flowed despite our 10 minute long photo taking stint, and the inclusion of onions made the Mesculun rather refreshing. A breakfast that I would want to wake up for!
Light hint of earthy and nutty tones in this cuppa.
Desserts are always something to look forward at any meal times. When in doubt, pick the chocolate you can never go wrong.
What\'s better than a hidden gem which is five minutes away from home. Mushroom fans will love Boufe\'s homemade baguette topped with truffle mushroom ragout and egg. Love the natural lighting and serenity here.
One of the places featured is Boufe Boutique Cafe, which looks set to be massively popular in 2015. Pictured is Boufe\'s Big Breakfast, or Triple B. Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh #Burpple
Already drawing comparisons to the popular Pacamara Boutique Coffee Roasters, Boufe Boutique Cafe is primed to be the next big thing in the cafe scene. Situated within Phoenix Park in the Tanglin area, Boufe (the word a portmanteau of \"boutique\" and \"cafe\") shares a space with a boutique called Ohvola. The usual brunch fare such as Eggs Benedict, Brioche French Toast and Croque Madame are served, but you should really try the Boufe\'s Big Breakfast or \"Triple B\". Boufe also serves pastries and offers a dinner menu. Be warned -- given the quality of the food and the killer combination of spaciousness, chic decor and a warm ambience, this place will only become more popular with time.
I didn\'t realise it\'s actually just beside my ex-workplace so people working around that area, you have one new place to hang out at. I will of course be back for their brunch/dinner menu! Thanks for the awesome service and not forgetting to ask the uncle to drive us to the entrance with the buggy!
Strawberry tart. Dessert after main dish. We wanted to give their strawberry shortcake a try, but it was sold out due to their popularity. However, this strawberry tart tastes great as well! 
Another typical brunch for everyone. Egg Benedict with toast, ham and greens. The rating for this dish - 4.2/5.0 as compared to their signature Triple B breakfast . Location isn\'t very convenient. Not driving? Inform security guard and they will direct u here. Not too sure if we received a value added service, as we were ferried here by the security\'s buggy. Kudos to the security for providing such a wonderful service. 
This classic big breakfast dish is definitely worth the price. The buttery croissant serves with sautéed mushrooms, scrambled eggs, bak kwa taste bacon and sausages, not forgetting the greens. Rating for the food - 4.7/5.0 worth to give it a try.
Without a doubt, this is the finest rendition of big breakfast I have had in Singapore. The bacon, which is glazed with honey, had a tinge of bak kwa mischief going on. The croissant is of the melt in mouth variety, whereas the eggs were fluffier than a Pomeranian. The mushrooms were nicely garlicky, while the pork sausage trumps the chicken sausage in the juiciness and crunchiness stakes. In conclusion, jaw-droppingly satisfying and value for money. I shared this with a friend and yet I\'m pleasantly full! 4.5/5
Located at a quite \'ulu\' place, but there\'s quite lots of crowds during lunch on a weekday..\n<br />The \"steak are high\" is a medium-cooked steak, lying on 2 pieces of hashbrown and with few pieces of onion rings on top of it.. The onion rings batter tastes quite nice but is quite thick..\n<br />The duck confit is well-executed, lying on a bed of soft and smooth mash potato.. The duck meat is quite juicy and tender..\n<br />The unicorn cake is coated with coconut moose, tasted quite light though.. The cake inside is soft and not dry..\n<br />I prefer the milky way cake probably cos it\'s a yoghurt based mousse and it tasted better with the calamansi jelly inside..\n<br />Overall a filling and decent meal, taste is as of its presentation.. Desserts are not too sweet..\n<br />*there\'s a complementary cake of choice when dine-in during your birthday or +/-3 days from birthday..\n<br />#boufesg #steaksarehigh #duckconfit #miniunicorncake #milkyway #lunch #birthdaylunch #burpple #mealbeforecny #caloriesoverload #jaslynfoodinstagram

One of those better yummier truffle fries I’ve ever ate!! Their shoestring fries is tossed with truffle oil, topped with parmesan cheese &amp; chives!! Wow that additional top of parmesan cheese is just too awesome!! Every Fries is equally tossed with truffle oil so you can really taste the truffle, unlike those which are tasteless.. and it’s not too oily too!! ❤️❤️ YUMS! @phusionade @boufesg #trufflefries #boufesg #boufeboutiquecafe #boufecafe
I love this set as there are more sides than the bread! The usual typical big breakfast brunch has 2 big chunk of breads which I usually ignore it as I’m way too full for it after finishing the sides so this plate is perfect for me! Yayyy! A small freshly baked buttery croissant, scrambled eggs, 2 different flavoured of sausages, mushrooms, greens &amp; baby’s Favourite of all, honey-glazed bacon!! It was so good that he was totally so hooked to it! A super yummy plate indeed! As for the drink, I ordered their Homemade Infused - Twilight (infused with honey &amp; lime) $7 🦄 it’s pretty and taste so good too! Not too sweet! Definitely worth my 30mins of waiting time to get a table! 😍 It’s so yummy that I’m planning to make a trip back again to try other foods! @phusionade @boufesg #boufesg #boufeboutiquecafe #boufecafe #chope #boufetwilight
Free cake if you visit during your birthday week.
Give me a million reason to say NO 🌈
🍹have a drinks before the weekend end.
This little unicorn cake is as good as it looks - coconut mousse, mango cremeux, vanilla sponge, and white milk glaze 😍 This ain’t the only thing worth squealing about, they have charcoal lemonades, Milky Way cakes, and all day bfast; what’s not to love?\n<br />—\n<br />//📸: Mini Unicorn Cake 🍰\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #singaporefood #sgeats #eatfamous #buzzfeedfood #foodporn #feedyoursoull #eeeeeats #beautifulcuisines #spoonfeed #foodstagram #eatingfortheinsta #instafood #foodphotography #foodgasm #getinmybelly #f52grams #sgfoodie #vancouverfoodie #好食 #onthetable #lovefood #相機食先 #먹스타그램 #맛있다 #cake #unicorncake #dessertporn #burpple

☺️😙😬\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />LOVE the cakes..❤️\n<br />.\n<br />THE ROCK was a really rich chocolate mousse cake with a good dose of rum 🥃\n<br />.\n<br />MILKY WAY was a little milky but the calamansi in the middle lent a burst of citrus to refresh the palate 🍋🍊🥛\n<br />.\n<br />DAISY CAKE was a fragrant blend of yuzu, lychee and green tea; the marshmallowy texture was really interesting! 🍵\n<br />.\n<br />CLASSIC CHEESE CAKE was not a bad cake, but pales in comparison to the other more interesting offerings; and eating such a rich cake at the end did not help raise its appeal 🧀\n<br />.\n<br />MINI MUSHROOM MELTS proves that you can never go wrong with cheese and mushrooms. Note that they are not minute in size at all! 🍄 🧀 .\n<br />TOMATO CRAB PASTA (SPICY) was very flavourful; recommend to choose the spicy version as the occasional fiery kick prevents monotonous taste 🍅 🦀 🍝\n<br />.\n<br />DAWN TO DUSK is essentially chamomile tea with lavender and silver dust; looks pretty, tastes decent but whether it\'s worth $7 is up to individual preferences ☕️\n<br />.\n<br />And now.. #nomorecake #needtoexercise\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#boufesg #cafesg #burrple #burrplesg
The pulled pork - flavourful without being salty; The poached eggs on point; The muffin warm and fresh. The taste of slightly bitter rocket leaves provides some sort of contrast and what you get is a wholesome, healthy breakfast 😊👌🏻\n<br />#cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood #instadaily #instafoodsg #foodstagram #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #instadaily #sgeats #igsg #sgig #boufeboutiquecafe #pulledpork #eggsbenedict #burpple #whati8today\n<br />#fotd #calorieswellspent
Unicorn cake 🦄 tastes like mango sticky rice. The white cream consist of coconut milk and also there is mango filling inside.\n<br />The MilkyWay cake looks soo cool like the night sky paint.

Beef is nice but the bread is abit too hard. 
Dessert is a must after a meal! 😋😂
Here for the 3rd time. The standard is consistently good! Tried the truffle mushrooms avocado with poached egg sourdough toast and I love it so much!! My gf love the coffee and the French toast! 
.
.
Salted egg yolk crayfish with in-house baked buckwheat bun is one of the dishes that everyone would try. Salted egg yolk sauce is a little too buttery for my liking. The bun and sautéed mushroom were good though! I have yet to try the shortcake as I was too full earlier. Should be good! ☝️😬\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #instafood #f52grams #instafood_sg #exsgcafes #singaporeinsiders #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #wimfdt #bestfoodworld #breakfast #saltedegg

It\'s one of the tastiest brunch I ever eaten, I love the sweet bacon and the sauteed mushrooms.
Truffle avocado mushrooms with poached eggs, eggs Benedict and the super shiok spicy crispy wings 👌🏼👌🏼

Too healthy for me. 😜
This truffle house avocado is kinda a healthier choice, and mushroom ragout is super yummy! \n<br />#weekendbrunch #sgcafe #cafehopping #burpple
finally satisfied my croissant craving. 😉
it comes with Condensed Milk but we requested to have it on the side - great dish for #vegetarian @igsg #igsg @boufesg #singapore #brunch #burpple #setheats #sgfood #sgcafe #sgcafehopping
You never know, the Phoenix might meet her Dragon 🐲 here...
Brunch with the #twnkl the over the weekend! Did you know that Boufe stands for Boutique Cafe? If you\'re wondering which is the tastiest, I recommend the salmon croissant. #soseats #boufesg #vscofood #flatlay #8dayseat #burpple #cafehoppingsg ☕️🍳
Walked a rather long distance to reach this cafe but its worth it for the food~ ♚The \'Triple B\' Breakfast Set was very savoury and hearty. Two big fat juicy sausages with crispy bacon and creamy eggs coupled with well sauteed mushrooms. Delightful to the gut.♚ ♛The Chicken Wings set was also a hit. Spiciness of the optimal level along with crispy skin and tender meat. 👍♛ #sgfood #burrple #foodgasm #foodsg #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igfoodies #foodporn #sgfoodporn #vscocam  #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgig #food #foodies  #foodphotography #instagood #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgdesserts #nom #sgfoodreviews #whatiate #onthetable #foodstamping #foodpornsg #boufe
remember the opera slice on my visit to Brunetti? glossy top with chocolate, hazelnut and coffee taste. imo Brunetti\'s is slightly more flavorful, but boufé\'s still yummy! #boufesg #operaslice #chocolate #hazelnut #coffee #dessert #cake #whati8today #8DAYSEat #burpple #sunday
chocolate smeared outside, caramel sauce inside :) #chocolatetart #boufesg #dessert #sunday #chocolate #whati8today #burpple #8DAYSEat

Throwback to yesterday\'s tiring but wonderful shoot with @elainewpf and @far_has ;) In frame is Boufe\'s signature Triple B and Spicy Chicken Wings. A gem hidden within the Redhill/Tanglin area, this cafe has a outdoor garden patio that is ideal for shoots or a casual lunch date.
Triple B, Smoked Salmon, Iced Lychee Tea. #boufesg #brunch #smokedsalmon #tripleB #whati8today #burpple #8DAYSEat #sunday #lunch

But I wished for the tangy sweet strawberry flavour to be more distinct.
Average imo
This place is packed.
😞 #boufesg #eatoutsg #foodporn #instafood_sg #burpple
Poached Eggs, homemade brioche, honey baked ham and hollandaise sauce.
Am afraid it might not seat well with the good folks @boufesg because this is not taken in their cafe setting.
Kinda crave for café food and a cup of latte.
essentially it is still just sausages, eggs and bacons.

hence we decided to do tea with cakes and coffee in this monochrome themed cafe. \n<br />yes it\'s the weekends, keep calm and fart.
They also have a boutique @ohvola inside the cafe so the ladies can eat and shop too! (I just bought a peptum top \\(//∇//)\\hahah )
Single order for double servings of Triple Bs. #whati8today #8dayseat #picoftheday #foodporn #igsg #instafood #instasg #omyfoodie #omysg #foodstagram #onthetable #burpple #cafe #cafesg #igsg #coffeeaddict
So was happy to see that #boufesg\n<br />offers the #boufesoldfashionbeefstew as one of the dinner mains.  It is truly a old fashion beef stew. No complicated tastes, ingredients or sides. Just simply good old fashion beef stew flavours with grilled bagutte slices to soak up the sauce! Have that homey, comfort food feeling to me. But note that the beef aren\'t very soft &amp; tender like those stews that had been cooked for a very long time. It is still have that slight chewy texture to it. Will go well with some red wine. Also don\'t think will go well with a strong drink like coffee, so will recommend having it with just water or light tea instead if no red wine.
Luckily it was a nice evening with cool breeze blowing. Got to enjoy this #prawnaglioolio alot at #boufesg. The prawns are fresh with nicely seared garlic. Only one thing, can be less oily tho but otherwise is very nice! \n<br />Kodak Ektar 100 \n<br />Comment &amp; photo credit: Memo of @otknpr, dated 22 Jan 2015.
This actually works better for me as I prefers this type over buffalo wings. \n<br />First thing, the wings are not oily. It is as if air-fried instead of deep fried. Not sure if this is indeed the case. This is good as it doesn\'t make us have that disgusted greasy feeling after eating them. For taste, they are quite decent without being overly salty as with most wings being sold around. \n<br />Kodak Ektar 100 \n<br />Memo &amp; pict credit: Memo of OTKNPR, dated 22 Jan 2015.  #brunch #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife #cafesg #coffee #coffeegram #coffeelife #coffeelove #coffeelover #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #lunch #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #sgcafefood #instafood_sg #burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders #otknpr #oftokyonparis
With the quiet surrounding and occasional breezes, this really gives a nice \"feel\"! 好有\"FU\"啊! As what people at Taiwan will say! Hahaha!
The cream of the truffle mushroom ragout toned down that strong bitterness which is usually associated with fresh mushrooms. Lastly the poached egg... Is still runny despite I spent quite a few mins taking photos! \n<br />Kodak Ektar 100 \n<br />Comment &amp; photo credit: Memo of @otknpr , dated 23 Jan 2015.
When they first served it to me, there is this full but yet thin layer of crema on top. This photo doesn\'t do justice to it as it dissipated due to my long photo taking. #boufesg had changed their beans supplier but is still good tho! \n<br />Kodak Ektar 100 \n<br />Comment &amp; photo credit: Memo of @otknpr , dated 23 Jan 2015.
I think despite the gaining popularity of #trufflefries, the smell of truffles doesn\'t really appeal to everyone. To me it is just like the smell of blue cheese, smelly tofu &amp; durian which does require some acceptance in order to enjoy it. \n<br />These fries of #boufesg should be more easily accepted as the smell of truffles aren\'t that strong &amp; aren\'t marred by the usual saltiness. The lemony dip does help to tone out the slight oiliness. Will recommend to have it by itself with a light icy drink. Perfect for a lazy afternoon!
Like the way how it contain tiny bits of almond nuts (if I am not wrong) which adds to the texture of the cake. Also the light coffee taste. The very important thing is that the bitterness of the chocolate are covered by the sweetness! I love chocolate this way!
Either is too sweet, too sour, too dense or too zesty in it and those that has mousse cream on top, either the mousse is too hard, flat or greasy. \n<br />Had hesitated to order this at #boufesg but is glad when I finally did. I can\'t vouch for other people\'s taste bud but this tart hits the right spot for me. The sweetness is just right to balance out the light sourness and the mousse came out as a surprise with it being light &amp; airy. Compliments to the baker chef! \n<br />Comment &amp; photo credit: Memo of @otknpr, dated 16 Jan 2015.
Hahaha! Really like the strawberries they use here at #boufesg Mostly sweet with just a slight hint of sourness without that unripe taste. The pastry crust has that faint savoury taste despite being sweet. Expected nothing less from the bakery chef who used to work at Antoinette! \n<br />Sorry Aloysius! For cropping away your head 😅.

Like the hollandaise sauce alot as it is much better than most of those at the other cafés. The poached eggs are also good cause it doesn\'t has that hint of vinegar which most has. The brioche are light enough not to make one feel overly stuffed and lastly the hams has a good chewiness without being rubbery. Although is not the best I had tasted but easily makes it to my top favorite list!
A very good mix between chocolate &amp; coffee. One of the rare places where I was super tempted to order a consecutive cup! Must try if you consider yourself as a mocha lover. \n<br />Filter: Kodak Ektar 100 \n<br />Memo &amp; pict credit: Memo of OTKNPR, dated 4 Apr 2014.
This cake is a delight to eat. With big chunks of fresh strawberries in it and cream that doesn\'t taste too overwhelming, it is one of the very good strawberry short cakes around! \n<br />Btw, all of #boufesg confectionery stuffs are done by thier own baker in-house! \n<br />Filter: Kodak Ektar 100 \n<br />Memo &amp; pict credit: Memo of @otknpr, dated 14 Jan 2015.
True to his words, it only has a nice hint of sweetness to it. A good alternative to the normal hot tea to go with the desserts &amp; cakes on a hot afternoon.
If you are tired of the mixed quality of the cafés, this place will surely give you a much need renewed hope &amp; desire to cafehop again. \n<br />Excellent setup, crew, foods &amp; coffee on top of the nice, peaceful &amp; quiet location. \n<br />Comment &amp; photo credit: Memo of @otknpr, dated 14 Jan 2015.

Menu from boufe
Scored a dish of crispy duck confit atop garlic mash and finished with orange demi-glaze. Need to head back for the highly-raved pastries especially the crossiants!
