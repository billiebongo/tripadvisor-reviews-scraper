Great Bak kut teh served hot and that chendol with its aromatic coconut milk and gula melaka syrup. Yum!
at Jurong Point Is the one-stop space where you can get the best of authentic food offerings from Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh.
A good mixed of fried food with really good nutty chilli sauce. The prawn fritter was thinly crusted with 2 mid sized prawns is really unique for Indian rojak. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 November 4
If you\'re Malaysian or love Malaysian food then this is the place to go. This mee is well fried and tasted yummy. Just like the ones in KL this one has lard bits in almost every bite. Deliciously yum yum yum! Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 November 4
The Claypot rice was so delicious and is only $5~ however the KL Hokkien Mee, I still prefer the Sentosa Malaysia food street. The wanton Mee, the pork was nice however the noodle is a bit salty. On a whole it was nice and overall spend ard $20~ for two person haha we eat a lot
Pasembur, Asam Laksa, Bak Kut Teh &amp; Pohpia! Quite a surprise knowing that there\'s a malaysian food court  in Singapore.
Great value, good place for those seek authentic Malaysia food! Starting $3 for chicken rice, $5 clay pot rice and $2 chendol
I had some sort of expectations prior to eating at Malaysia Boleh. But I tak boleh tahan. Should\'ve ordered desserts for dinner.
Âè§Êó©Âë≥ | Old school \"Chendol\" that is origin from Penang, Malaysia. $2 for this bowl of dessert is worth it because the ingredients is really full!  #burpple #malaysiabolehsg
I have never eaten ban chang kuih that is so crispy before!!! Totally love itüòç  #burpple #malaysiabolehsg
w/ my usual girlsüíï The food is really sedap!! #burpple #malaysiabolehsg
One of the awesome pot rice in malaysia style! You never wanna miss it!
Whopping amount just nice for sharing.
Or more like Malaysia tak boleh. I have a weakness for rice in a clay/stone pot. Thinking of slightly burnt rice always makes me salivate. But this was a slight disappointment. The rice was not fragrant enough and there was more chicken skin than chicken meat. $5 for this just isn\'t very worth it. D
Good with fried oysters and claypot rice!
Malaysia Boleh is loosely translated to ‚ÄúMalaysia Can Do It!‚Äù. Expect 17 different stalls in a air-conditioned food court, each of them have at least 20 years of history. Here\'s a bowl of sweet delight from Penang Road Famous  read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/malaysia-boleh/
The smell was incredible. Few slices of red sweet Cha Siew with the savory noodle made the ultimate combo. I just can\'t get sick of such sweet and savory combination. \n<br />The wanton was good but nothing special. \n<br />KL Wanton Mee, ÂêâÈöÜÂù°ÈºéË®ò‰∫ëÂêûÈù¢ \n<br />Malaysia Boleh\n<br />Jurong Point\n<br />63 Jurong West Central 3\n<br />#03-28\n<br />Singapore 648331\n<br />Opening Hours:\n<br />Daily: 10am - 10pm

The queue was so long for this, it took me more than half an hour wait for uncle to dish this up. Not bad 
Penang Road Famous Cendol to chill off the heat! KL Hokkien Mee lunch wasn\'t photo worthy.
The Apom Manis at #MalaysiaBoleh comes in 4 flavours. Peanut, Banana, Kaya and Corn.
Finally get to try the Claypot Rice at #MalaysiaBoleh. No wonder so many people order this, it is good!
KL ÈºéËÆ∞ Wanton Noodle at #MalaysiaBoleh. The dark soya sauce is specially imported from Malaysia exactly what the stall owner used in KL.
Good flavours from Ëãè‰∏πË°óÁÇ≥Âì•Á¶èÂª∫Èù¢ (KL Hokkien Mee)! But the noodles not quite right.
fried oyster omelette
air mata kucing
penang fried kway teow
rickshaw noodles
One of the treats that I absolutely love is Apong Balik, or Apom Balik. These are popular sweet treats that are still sold by streets hawkers in Penang today. .
Great soup base and tasty meat. Could have been better with more meat though.
This stall sells both the Penang Laksa and Prawn Noodles. Just order one of each. Yums!
This giant pork/chicken bao is a true Malaysian delight. Check out the filling!
Get into ma belleh!! (After I take a photo of you)
Ping Ge KL Hokkien Mee from Malaysia Boleh Jurong Point is... Okay lah. One of the better versions in Singapore. Many of which... just can\'t quite make it.
Penang Apom Manis ‚ô• With banana, coconut, peanut and sweet corn filling. Next time will come back for fried durian, fried banana and fried 3-in-1 yam, sweet potato and nian gao ‚ô•
IT IS SO AWESOME OMG the contrasting textures are perfect... not sure if this is the best since i got nothing to compare it too, but it was so, so good. 
Hot hot claypot rice! Luckily i do not have to wait long for this!
They don\'t serve with chill. It\'s just black sauce. The only chill you can add is green chili. Sauce is sweet and char siew is good too. You will get 3 to 4 wanton in the soup. It\'s Malaysia Boleh style of WTM.

Finally had time to sit down and catch our breathe.\n<br />This time round we decided on a fuss free hawker meal. Seafood Hor Fun. ü¶êüçñ\n<br />The plate was overflowing, and even the meats &amp; seafood were plenty. $6 a plate.

Next round will ask for more chilli! Haha! #drybanmian #jurongpoint #igdaily #latergram #malaysiaboleh #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple #burpplesg #jurongwest #boonlay #dinner #foodcourt
And I like that it came out really warm. (it still remained warm despite me taking up time to take photos.) Different style of noodles compared to the usual kway chap but still good. \n<br />The chilli dip goes really well, and you can taste the slight garlic aroma which makes the chilli pack a kick.\n<br />I would definitely come back for it. \n<br />#lunch #hawkers #sgfoodiary #burpple

Went to Malaysia Boleh! at Jurong Point for dinner, ordered a Prawn noodles (Big)(SGD5.00).\n<br />When my order was ready, I noticed there was no 3 pieces of pork-ribs inside the bowl like the previous portion I had.\n<br />So I asked: where is the pork-ribs?\n<br />The staff answered me: Oh, sold out, no more.\n<br />Another staff replied with impatient tone: I have added noodles, add prawn, add other things more for you!\n<br />I replied: You should tell me early, so I can order a normal size (SGD3.50).
#asamlaksa
Standards seems to have dropped, alittle too more oily and less eggy but still comfort food for me. \n<br />Anywhere else have this kind of eggy omelette? Let me know üôãüèª
Shaved ice melts in your mouth as the infusion of heavily sweet gula melaka (palm sugar) spreads over your cooling tongue, with a fragrance of coconut milk. Their alluring brown syrup makes it a refreshing end to the savoury meal platters at Malaysia Boleh. Homemade green jelly worms lend a touch of pandan flavour to the mix, with plump, toothsome kidney beans translating a grainy texture through a soft crunch. Simple, rounded comfort is dished into a traditional porcelain bowl from a cart, like along Penang Road, at $2 each.
The first taste of this Sister Curry Chicken Mee is a bite into a piece of poached chicken thigh, gliding silky smooth over your tongue, melting soft and easy in your mouth. A spoon of broth leads you into fragrant vegetable curry, with a comfortable amount of coconut milk. The soupy consistency of flavourful veggie base isn\'t overly rich. Combining yellow noodles and vermicelli is how the boy always orders. With the crunch of long beans and bursts of curry soaked up from the fried beancurd puffs, this bowl is rather addictive if you enjoy veggie curry üçúüòã
$2 chendol are so affordable, yet so delish.
Price: $4.50

This prawn noodles is rich in prawn flavour just by looking at the color of the soup. And it doesn\'t disappoint upon tasting it.

Tried. Move on ‚è©.\n<br />Perhaps im used to having our local char kway teow with more black sauce and cockles. Overhyped. But i must admit i will wanna try it once to be convinced.\n<br />There is so much other food that i wanna try!

If you like something light, the Pork Noodle at #MalaysiaBoleh is comforting and brimming with ingredients.
The five spice powder and chilli sauce for the Lor Bak at #MalaysiaBoleh is imported all the way from Penang.
The Penang Char Kway Teow is the most popular stall at #MalaysiaBoleh. It has the longest queue among the other stalls.
My favourite plate of runny egg Fried Oyster from #MalaysiaBoleh
The Penang Chendol from #MalaysiaBoleh is really not bad. Love it.
