Thankful to the fat and tendon, the pork was able to endure long hours of braising without breaking apart. \n<br />The fat melted into the sauce and the meat soaked up the sauce. A complete cycle of flavors. \n<br />Song Fa Bak Kut Teh\n<br />11 New Bridge Road #01-01\n<br />Singapore 059383 \n<br />7.00am - 10.00pm\n<br />Closed on Monday \n<br />6533 6128 \n<br />www.songfa.com.sg
The stomachs need to be washed with rough salt and water over many times.
Just a gentle bite, the meat will easily fell off the bone. The spices and herbs helped to remove the \"porky\" smell from the rib and brought out its sweetness. \n<br />One bite of rib, one mouthful of steamy white rice and one spoonful of the peppery soup! \n<br />Song Fa Bak Kut Teh\n<br />11 New Bridge Road #01-01\n<br />Singapore 059383 \n<br />7.00am - 10.00pm\n<br />Closed on Monday \n<br />6533 6128 \n<br />www.songfa.com.sg

Bak Kut Teh, one of Singapore\'s most popular local dish. Also called \'Meat Bone Tea\', it originated in the 19th century by Chinese coolies who needed a tonic to boost their health. Which is your fav BKT shop? #instavideo
all in all, #songfabakkutteh for a farewell #lunch i think everyone was very satisfied with the meal! hope we all can meet up for #sweechoon or something hehe. and sorry i dont have everybody\'s ig :/
the star of the day, #bakkutteh #bkt this is $8 portion, 5 large ribs for me to nom. today\'s meat tasted super tender than last week lol. was feeling super hungry after starting work at 9. $6/8, $8.50 for premium ribs. actually not much of a diff, just get the $8 one lol.
dont say i never eat vege ok. lol. stirred fried soy #kailan at $5.50 its good but hehe im more of a meat person lol.
today awesome #lunch! seriously this is my first time eating piggy trotters outside and im not disappointed at all! yums! my impression is that it\'s full of fats but nope the meat is done real good. $6 for this.
Awesome peppery soup! Side dishes were decent, pig stomach was shiok and pork rib is not too tough. Wanna head back to try the rest of the dishes. All these for just a lil over $20! 
apologies for the blurry pic. #songfabakkutteh for #lunch yesterday. i had the $6 dish, there is $6/8 dish, $8.50 for premium spare ribs. freeflow soup, rice at $0.60 per bowl and other nice dishes. #chinesefood #chinese
so my friend and i decided to eat this. the rain came just in time cos the pepper soup made us feel better in the cooling afternoon. #bakkutteh #songfabakkutteh #lunch #chinesefood #soup
Bringing an OZ friend around town and he wanted to try the most #fearfactor thing we have in Singapore. It was too early for sup tulang(sucking bone marrows ala Flinstones) and durian is for dessert so we went for bak kut teh and I ordered this for him:-\n<br />Large bowl of pig\'s stomach, pig\'s kidney and pig\'s tail üò∞
Friend said it\'s one of the best bak kut teh around.
1/5 of the #5shotchallenge tagged by @gracejy ‚ò∫‚ò∫she\'s been very nice giving me the theme of yummy #sgfood! Decided to start with something that might gross quite a number of people - kidney bak kut teh! Is this a yay or nay for you?
Bak Kut Teh
Comfort food on a rainy day and first time trying their slice fish in Bak Kut Teh soup! The fish appears to be coated with a layer of flour to give that chewiness. Overall was an interested one. Glad that song fa has not increase the price of their side dish unlike many other popular places.
