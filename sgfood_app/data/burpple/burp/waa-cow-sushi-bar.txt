Had lunch yesterday at Waa Cow Raffles Xchange, which used to be only at NUS. Great news for me, because this is where I could go for a quick and affordable lunch with my colleagues, and still satisfy our wagyu cravings.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The beef bowls are good. Expect aburied beef that are sweet and tender, and very, very flavourful as they\'re generous with their ingredients such as mentaiko, tobiko and truffle oil (depending on the beef bowl you ordered). All beef bowls came with an onsen egg, intentionally served at a medium thick consistency which you could eat on its own or use it to coat the rice and beef.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Other reviews to follow, this is taken during a Burpple Eatup.
Hopped over to Waa Cow Sushi Bar right after being at Jjigae Jjigae to try out what they have to offer here. 
Highly raved about, Waa Cow\'s flame-torched Nikiri-glazed beef slices exudes juiciness with a good flavourful hint of char.\n<br />Truth be told, I had my doubts when presented this Mentaiko-Beef combination (although I absolutely love Mentaiko-many-things), it\'s just mind boggling. But this, this was Surf and Turf on a genius level. Try it to believe it!
Don\'t remember this on their menu when I first visited, but this crowd-pleasing combo of scallops and mentaiko is going to take willpower to resist if I\'m near Raffles Place! üòõ
üëçüèº I love this aburi wagyu beef donburi üòç the beef is a little on the fatty side, and it suits me just fine üòÅ Initially wanted to order the mini don, but the regular portion makes a more satisfying lunch! Top up $3 for a set with either 3pc salmon sashimi or seaweed salad with hot tea bag (brand unidentifiable) or Pokka\'s unsweetened jasmine green tea.
Newly opened at Raffles Xchange, we now get to enjoy these bowls without having to travel to the far West (hurry for me!). Using painstakingly selected ingredients, they ensure diners get an enjoyable meal at reasonable prices.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Known for their beef bowls, truffle lovers might want to go for Truffle Wagyu Beef ($19.90). Premium Wagyu beef cooked sous vide for 24 hours covered in black truffle puree and white truffle oil with an onsen egg and tobiko roe, it\'s packed with flavor. Or those who can\'t take beef like me can get Mentaiko Salmon ($18.90), which is only available at this outlet! A thick slab of salmon fillet that\'s lightly charred on the outside and creamy inside, coated with luscious mentaiko sauce, special Shoyu glaze, and ponzu marinated garlic.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Waa Cow!\n<br />Address: 5 Raffles Place, B1-63 Raffles Xchange, Raffles Place MRT, Singapore 048618\n<br />#waacowsg
Tender Wagyu and onsen egg are pretty much a typical combination for Don. With torched Mentaiko topping, that\'s a winner. Everything in the bowl came together nicely and tasted really comforting. A good place for one in the CBD looking to settle a meal taking taking the train home.
I can\'t say how much more I love mentaiko salmon. This slab of smooth and flaky salmon is actually pretty good, definitely coming back for more!
Aburi style is my all time favourite. Spent S$18.90 on this donburi ü§§
üòç‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks @waacowsg for this delicious Mentaiko Wagyu beef bowl topped with onsen egg n tobiko! Super tender Wagyu and the mentaiko dressing is to die for. Conveniently located at Raffles xchange basement for the working peeps ‚úåüèª

Didn\'t expect to be mindblown by this place cause of many similar places I\'ve been to.. but the beef was on point, so moist, so tasty! The Chirashi was just as good! The main meal starts at around $18, it\'s a bit steep for cbd, but worth the quality! TOP up $5/$8 for a set, there are 3 to choose from!  Now, go go go!
Added $1 for an onsen egg with tobiko. Super yummy. Soft, perfectly cooked salmon topped with punchy ponzu marinated garlic and mentaiko. Rice had great texture too. I want this place to succeed but the question is whether it will survive in the long run, what with the (probably killer) rent, the fact that the shop wasn\'t full when we went, and the relatively high prices of the bowls ($16.90 and above)...
The price may seem steep but it really isn\'t for such a high quality beef bowl. The wagyu is almost melt-in-your-mouth grade and the perfect 62 degree egg complements it so well!! Will definitely be back for more.
A pretty huge slab of sashimi-grade salmon sits atop a bowl of lightly charred Japanese rice, showered with generous amounts of tobiko and furikaki - my mouth was watering before I even started eating. The salmon was cooked perfectly with lusciously soft insides, and the smoky mentaiko sauce went really well with it.
Fans of Waa Cow! at NUS can now get their fix in the CBD. True to its name, beef is the focus at this Raffles Xchange establishment. Waa Cow! serves an excellent wagyu beef rice bowl, so over here, you won\'t go wrong with the Signature Aburi Wagyu Beef Donburi ($21.90) ‚Äî add $2 if you want the beef topped with mentaiko (!) or $5 with shaved truffle (!!). We also recommend ordering the Petite Wagyu Sushi Platter ($16.90), which comes with four different wagyu sushi ‚Äî  the classic, yuzu kosho, mentaiko and truffle parmesan. The latter is super earthy and aromatic from both truffle and cheese. Beefy business aside, you might also consider the Yuzukosho Iberico Butadon ($16.90), a really satisfying pork bowl, or the Mentaiko Salmon ($18.90), which features a really generous piece of fish over rice ‚Äî perfect if you\'re really hungry!

I\'ve always wanted to try out Waa Cow\'s alluring ricebowls, but I could never find the motivation to go to another country (a.k.a. the west side of this island) just to sample their goods. However, they\'ve decided to come to me instead with their new sushi bar in Raffles Exchange, taking over from where TCC left off.
Signature Aburi Wagyu Don ($21.90)
If you\'re not feeling the red meat today, you can always opt for their Mentaiko Salmon! Honestly when it arrived, we were pretty surprised (pleasantly) at the size of the slab of salmon in front of us! 
Their signature bowl sees buttery, tender slices of beef that oozes juices with every bite accompanied by some pickles and an onsen egg. Definitely one of those \'treat yoself\' meals when you just wanna indulge in life a little.
Couldn\'t remember the name of this dish but definitely could remember the taste of it. The pork had a nice torched taste to it, and the rice was nicely moist with what I assume was pork gravy. It had a slightly sweet hint to it, but was full of flavour. Needless to say, no rice bowl is complete without an onsen egg. This is one of the more satisfying and good pork rice bowls I\'ve eaten and I would come back for more.
From Waa Cow Sushi Bar, a new concept that serves as an extension to Waa Cow at NUS situated at the heart of the Central Business District replacing part of TCC\'s now-defunct Raffles Xchange location ‚Äî the new location serves up mainly Wagyu Beef Donburi with Wagyu Sushi; there are a few other dishes involving Pork and Salmon for non beef eaters to choose from.
One of the options that non-beef eaters can go for here especially for those who are looking for a substantial meal. While the bowl is visually smaller than other places, the salmon comes in a thick, generous slab. The rice comes similar to the ones served at Waa Cow! back at NUS ‚Äî slightly charred for a light smokiness with scallions topped above. The sashimi-grade salmon is crisp on the outside, flaky and smooth within ‚Äî comes with the distinct flavour of salmon with a light char that matches so well with the umami Mentaiko drizzled above while topped with fish roe for a popping sensation. A great option for those who are not into beef here.
The onsen egg and wasabi ball provided amazing contrasts to the texture and taste of the bowl. And of course, mentaiko needs no elaboration üòè\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #hungrygowhere #whati8today #exploresingapore #foodiesg #8dayseat #sgfoodie #iweeklyfood #foodstagram #foodporn #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #foodphotography #wagyubeef #beefbowl #mentaiko
But oh boy, did it justify the cost. Such a thick and generous serving of salmon, torched with my favourite mentaiko sauce - so smooth and savoury. Not forgetting the runny egg yolk on the side. We all deserve an occassional treat-yourself day - this is exactly what we need!

Sushi Bar at Raffles Place. The beef is grilled to perfect medium, chrewy inside, slightly charred at the side, with the fat slightly oozing with strong aroma. The mentaiko on top is torched well to add another layer of aroma. Sous vide egg at the side not just brings a good color balance, once I mixed it well with rice, it made the rice tasted more fragrant even though it\'s already blanketed by a rich bed of wagyu beef. I normally like to eat slowly to savour my food, but today I cleared the bowl under 15 minutes -- too good to slow down üòÜü§£üòÇ#food #goodfood #eat #eatwell #dinner #beef #wagyu #don #donburi #foody #foodie #foodlover #sgfood #sgfoodie #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodiegram #instafood #instaeat #instagood #instayum #instadaily #yum #yummy #delicious #foodilicious #nom #waacow #burpple

Those who know me well know that I am allergic to fish roe. I gave in to a moment of weakness here and ate the mentaiko. I paid dearly for this as my right eye was swollen for 2 days üò±! Was it worth it? It was very tasty and it went really well with the chunky wagyu but nothing is worth the swollen eye üò≠.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_waacow #waacowsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
üòÇ Wished the #beef was a little more rare and that the #truffle sauce had a bit more fragrance in it, but besides that I rather enjoyed this bowl of rich, tasty goodness. A wistful #throwback to some #yumminess because I\'m sad the languid long #weekend is coming to an end already. üò¢

Tried this fairly new sushi bar at Raffles Exchange. Its original outlet is located within the NUS campus.\n<br />*\n<br />The wagyu beef was charred really well. Served with a 62-degree celcius egg, truffles and soy based beef sauce on Akitakomachi rice, it was really delicious!\n<br />*\n<br />While the price is a little steep at $22.90, you do feel like you are eating a good quality donburi.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_waacow #waacowsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Tender wagyu beef, atop of Japanese rice that was cooked to perfection. And of course that onsen egg elevated the dish to another level. üêÑüêÑüêÑ\n<br />.\n<br />Available in 2 sizes: Mini ($11.9) and Regular ($19.9). The price is pretty steep considering the portion is small (even the regular size is still small for me). .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #foodcoma #foodphotography #foodgasm #sgfoodie #sgrestaurant #sgfoodie #vscocam #yummy #japanesefood #sgfoodstylist #sgfoodblogger #likesforlikes #sgfood #foodstyling #foodstylist #foodplating #likesforlikes #burpple #foodblogger #f52grams #foodie #vscocam #wagyu #beef #donburi
The taste and texture is comparable to ch≈´toro, but a little more chewy with the ivory network of marbled fat. Dip it in @WaaCowSg\'s house-made shoy≈´, alongside a tiny dollop of yuzukosh≈ç, and you\'ll have the perfect bite. Ingredients in the secret soy sauce is, of course, undisclosed. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n<br />~\n<br />#canon5dmarkiv #canon100mmlmacro #canonsg #foodphotography #waacowsg #wagyu #wagyubeef #sashimi #raw #beef
Very well seasoned beef and sous vided till tender. Slightly sweet and that teeny weeny bit of gravy tossed with the runny yellow yolk (sorry... my excitement made me forget to snap the ooze), harmonizes perfectly with the rice. Savoring the beef slowly left a lingering umami finish on my palate.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />My grouse was that the pieces of wagyu are small. This is a regular size bowl. Personally I felt that the cost is atad on the high side. Current promo, get a 15% discount after you \"follow\" Waacow on instagram on facebook page.
