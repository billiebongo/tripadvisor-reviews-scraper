Pretty disappointing. Only liked the lemon tart. Shld\'ve ordered their egg bens. ): 
Not too bad, nice quiet place on a weekday. And good coffee!
Although I must say, Paris still offers the best quiche I\'ve tasted, baker &amp; cook is not somewhere too far from it. Feta cheese salad is awesome!
Too much flour 
I love fresh tarts! Definitely good to buy this in the morning! Crust is divine!
A tad too small but this was yummy and moist! One of the better carrot cakes around! :)
yummy yummy
yummy yummy
been so busy rushing for submissions, my feeding timings are all messed up :
i like this :&gt; requested for some apricot jam to go with the bread! and bought a loaf and a jar home too
it\'s $8.50 i think, but super healthy and it\'s really nice! other than berries there\'s apple and banana thrown into the mix too, if i\'m not wrong
with a cube of brownie that i gobbled before taking this picture
Enjoy your Sunday. Enjoy your breakfast. \"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things.\"
A very stressful day today! I need lots &amp; lots of cakes!!!
have always been a fan of baker &amp; cook, and their salads are delicious! the dressings aren\'t over done and the salad is really fresh
I LOVE CAKE full stop
I love this type of breakfast! Wish I can have it everyday!
@wiryawanivan kinda cake . Gluten n dairy free lemon cake . Yumzzz
Very puzzled by the fact that people sitting outside the cafe were served food in bento boxes. Totally not aesthetically appealing and made this egg royale not so \"royal\". #eggsroyale #brunch #cafe
Lemon Meringue Tart was good, with a sweet and not too sour curd and perfect pastry &amp; Orange Almond Cake which was moist and soft üëç
Tried two of their donuts. A salted caramel donut is really good, the chocolate truffle not so. Salted Caramel has that zesty flavor to it, in addition to it being loaded with caramel. Donut texture is a mix of Dunkins and KK. \n<br />Salted Caramel 4.5/5\n<br />Chocolate truffle 4/5
üç∞ kind of sweet but I like it. üòª
Coffee and cakes 
(Elephant shape).\n<br />Homemade Brioche, dipped in lightly spiced egg custard, serve with fresh fruit, maple syrup, lemon curd and mascapone with generous sprinkled with toasted almonds. .\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #bakerandcook #bakerandcooksg #burpple #igsgfood #igsg #sgig #instafood_sg #instafoodsg #frenchtoast #cafescenesg #cafescene
Not the best I\'ve tasted but still pretty good. \n<br />Chocolate Lemington ($5) - soft and fluffy chocolate sponge cake with desiccated coconut. Not a fan of Lemingtons but üíñ likes the Lemington here a lot.. said it taste good.
One of the eggs was poached near to well done. Overall taste pretty good with a hint of spice though I would prefer if the bacon wasn\'t too crispy . Should get the salmon next time instead.. #breakfast #brunch #eggbenedict #instagood #foodlover #vscofood #onthetable #whati8today #food #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodporn #foodpornography #getinmybelly #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #happytummy #foodphotography #foodpics #icapturefood #foodstamping #openricesg #burpple

Great breakfast to start the day with Spanish Omelette [$16] and a double shot Latte [$5]. They also have a wide selection of bread, pastries and tarts. Opens daily. #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgcafe #sgcafefood #instafoodsg #burpple #latteart #eatoutsg #sgfoodunion
Carbo overload for the man who needs it..
Tokyo @iamcyrix will like this mocha. Very chocolaty taste to it.\n<br />#burpple #bakerandcooksingapore #bakerandcook #mocha #mochaart #greenwood #bukittimah
Nice eggs and bread although will prefer the sauce to be slightly stronger in taste. Really like the rather tough crunchy bread too! \n<br />#burpple\n<br />#bakerandcook #bakerandcooksingapore #greenwood #bukittimah #eggbenedict
