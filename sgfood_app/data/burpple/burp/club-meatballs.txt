Throwback to the surprise birthday dinner that the boyfriend planned for me, with the help of the bestest friends @dawnmusk, @ccher, @missmandyy and @shauneeie. The food was less than stellar ‚Äì exceedingly dry pork balls üòû ‚Äì but the company was brilliant. My heart feels like it\'ll burst when I think of these friends who\'d go out of their way to make me happy, and the boy who never fails to touch me with his warmth  and consideration. üíïüíã
that tatse of smoked bbqed pulled pork, not too oily; topped with pickles caramelized onions; completed with fluffy burger buns (although I feel deep fried man tou can do the job)
the risotto was definitely undercooked, the grains were hard. \n<br />nonetheless, dinner with great company on gossips and bdae celebration
Club Meatballs is Sarnie\'s latest venture right after The Lokal. Taking on a meatball-centric focus, they offer a variety of meatballs of different meats, from standard ones such as Wagyu Beef to quirky ones such as Salmon &amp; Coriander. Menu varies for lunch and dinner; lunch sees subs, wraps and salads on the menu, while dinner sees a mix and match of carbs, proteins and greens. As per everything offered at The Lokal, expect everything to be made from scratch, from the meatballs all the way down to the sauces. Sarnies affiliation with Club Meatballs would somewhat guarantee the quality of the food served here; a spot that would be worth a shot for lunch for the office workers around the area.
Since Club Meatballs is affiliated with The Lokal and Sarnies, its little wonder that Club Meatballs uses blends roasted by Sarnies. Forgot to ask them for the origin of the beans, but its strong body packs a fruity punch within this creamy and smooth cuppa
Club Meatballs offer a menu of pre-selected combination of wraps for lunch. The Spaniard contains Wagyu Beef Meatballs, Sobrassada, Blue Cheese, Green Chillies and Roasted Onions in a wrap. Meatballs were firm but was easy to bite as well, and had no gamey aftertaste. Soaked in a tangy tomato-based sauce, it was bursting of flavours with melted goat cheese which gave it a savoury touch. There\'s a choice of switching the wrap for a Ciabatta bun at an additional cost of $1.
Meatballs included.
For lunch, Club Meatballs offers Pimp-My-Salad which allows for one to choose their choice of proteins, carbs, greens and dressings. Asked for some recommendations for the Fresh Salmon and Coriander Balls, where the staff that had recently transferred from The Lokal that I recognized chose for me the Mixed Lettuce, Oven-Roasted Onions, 65 degree egg, Saut√©ed Mushrooms with the Basil &amp; Pine Nut Pesto. The Salmon meatballs made have sounded pretty quirky, but I loved how the meatballs were free of fishy odour, yet retaining a light touch of Salmon flavour combined with a hint of Coriander for that spiced taste. The Basil &amp; Pine Nut pesto was moderate tasting, and made the greens more tolerable. Saut√©ed mushrooms added an earthy flavour, while roasted onions were crunchy and juicy. A salad filling for a guy with a slightly smaller than usual appetite!
From the good people behind Sarnies and The Lokal comes Club Meatballs, a gastropub specializing in - you guessed it - meatballs. Build your own meatball plate  with a choice of sauce, toppings and bases. Of course, it\'s convenient CBD location means you can come here just for a mid-day coffee fix, as well as after-work cocktails, wines and beers on tap. 
A classic combination of sharp lemon custard and a sweet pillowy meringue, filled with caramelized pineapples and pistachios. I wish I could bring the jar home!
Here at Club Meatballs, you get to \"pimp your balls\" in any way you desire. First up, choose what balls you fancy, then put some sauce on your balls. Lastly, put something below your balls and devour everything on the plate. 
Ordered the wagyu beef and rosemary meatballs with truffled mushroom for toppings and parmesan risotto for the base. The wagyu beef meatball is very tasty, soft and tender. Sauteed mushroom is done well, with a layer of truffle oil that seeps into the parmesan risotto base layer, adding another dimension to the parmesan cheese taste. The parmesan risotto is slightly on the dry side, but it\'s not too cheesy and overpowering. Would hope that they will present their food on a nicer plate cuz it doesn\'t fit e western image of this place.
Iberico pork and fennel topped with tomato and basil with mashed potato. The pork meatball is soft and tender with a slight peppery taste. Topped with tomato that gives a fresh greenery taste, you won\'t get sick of the meat taste. Mashed potato is soft and creamy which compliments well with the meatballs. I would prefer to have to beef meatballs as it\'s more tender.
The much anticipated Club Meatballs, the latest project of Sarnies is set to be one of the hottest club in town. Currently open Mondays to Saturdays from dusk to dawn, serving hot food and drinks till late.

Basically you choose the type of meatballs, what\'s under the meatballs (carbs/veg), and what\'s over the meatballs (sauce). Really filling overall and probably my combination was a tad too heavy for me although it was plenty flavourful. Probably should have opted for the salsa sauce for some acidity.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #meatballs #sgrestaurant #burpple
Was expecting Spanish food but this place served up a more fusion rather than traditional Spanish fare. Really good baked eggs with bacon, cheese and potatoes üëçüèª #sgfood #bakedeggs #grilledoctopus #burpple
Robust coffee and friendly barista set us in for a comfy brunch with the same friendly team who brings us Sarnies and The Lokal.
Spanish brunch - love this place 
New kid on the block. Look at that 65 deg egg over those wagyu and rosemary meatballs üòã
Pimp my salad! Light and yummy lunch 
Very crispy and tasty! It\'s the perfect #BarSnack! :) #sgfoodie #clubmeatballs #sgfood #sgcafe #foodphotography #foodpic #foodporn #burpple

Fish and chicken meatballs with half white bean cassoulet and half roasted veg with salsa verde. Dry again, veg pretty oily but the salsa verde was excellent!! 
Beef and pork with tagliatelle and truffle mushroom sauce. Hmm pretty dry meatballs... And the sauce wasn\'t enough to coat the pasta 
If I recall correctly it was supposed to be cottage cheese, mango, honey and walnuts. There wasn\'t any walnuts but instead a berry compote. I was expecting a sweet and savory combi but this just tasted like dessert 
although a stark difference in taste but seemingly unique.
Love you all so very much!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíôüíöüíõüòòüòç
