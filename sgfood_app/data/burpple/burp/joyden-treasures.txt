Where are you!!😍🙋🏻 This bowl of traditional orh nee with pumpkin and ginkgo is to die for! Really! I want everything to myself!🙈🙊 .\n<br />I like how it\'s not overly sweet, no heavy use of coconut milk, just the genuine taste of yam. 😌👌🏻.\n<br />.\n<br />Ps: the old school brown sugar steam cake, ma la gao, in the background is a must try too! So light and fluffy!
Love the crispy duck skin along with the flavours of pickled papaya and the sambal + orange sauce. I wouldn\'t mind going back for this. ⋅\n<br />#JoydenTreasures
Super delicious! 😍👍🏻\n<br />⋅\n<br />#JoydenTreasures *
After dim sum, I went home and slept my Saturday away🤗
Back at Joyden Treasures again, but for their dimsum spread this time. The pan fried carrot cake was our most favorite and salted egg custard bun being the least. Because the 流沙包 didn\'t 流 😥
I pretty much look forward to every dish on the media tasting menu we serve at Joyden Treasures, but this one is a mega showstopper.
What a delightful experience! I love the sweetness of the meat, coupled with the bounce on the meat. Enjoyed the smoky favored finish. Screams freshness and \"the chef knows his stuff\". This serves as a refreshing alternative to the usual chili and black pepper flavors. 
Cleared most of the work and I feel lighter now, oh I think it\'s because I didn\'t had dinner🙊, now I can\'t decide to go home to sleep it off or to fill my stomach. I only know I\'m craving badly for [Crispy Fragrant Duck with Petite Lotus Buns 欣藝脆皮香酥鸭 S$58]. The whole duck is \n<br />gently simmered with fragrant herbs and spices to give it full-bodied flavour, and then deep fried quickly to crisp the skin. The homemade steamed lotus-shaped buns is so soft, I can eat quite a few kosong ones at 1 go, I swear🙋🏻! But don\'t la, stuff the buns with fall-off-the-bone flesh, homemade pickled papaya and fresh cucumber, they taste really good!
Feel like biting into this soft &amp; fluffy old school steamed cake [Malagao S$4.20]
rarely do you come across baked crabs and I must say it was quite delicious. as its name suggest, the crab is baked in salt for 30 mins, coming out pipping hot with lotsa flavours.
(Auntie noticed that the Siew mai fell and help to arrange back so that it looks prettier. LOL)
Without much marination, I could taste the delicate and sweet taste of the crab meat. 🦀 |\n<br />ps/ for some reason I can\'t find joyden treasures geotag 😥
One of the showstoppers at Joyden\'s new concept, which features family heritage recipes from the owners, is this crustacean baked with three types of salt – table, rock and sea for a carefully measured balance of saltiness and smokiness.
Lobster shells boiled for hours to make this pot of yummy broth with thick porridge and rice puffs. Totally a perfect dish in this cooling weather !\n<br />.\n<br />#foodspotting #bonappetit #setheats #burpple  #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #8dayseat #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #beautifulcuisines #onthetable #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #myfab5 #singaporeinsiders #vscofood #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #exploresingapore #onthetable #foodstagram #openricesg

There are many restaurants out there that does it well while some which absolutely butchers it. To serve a good rendition; fresh, not frozen, fish has to be used and the accompanying ingredients should complements the natural flavours and not overpower it. Execution at its purest form, the steaming of the young threadfin with pickled Chinese olives, silken tofu, shittake, mustard greens, tomatoes, ginger and the secret ingredient of pork belly fat creates a distinct olive-like flavour and sweet nuances that makes eating this steamed fish such an enjoyable moment.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Joyden Treasures\n<br />Address: 5, Stadium Walk, Leisure Park Kallang, Unit 02-42, Singapore 397693\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #restaurantsg #joydentreasures #sixthsensepr #sixthsensepreats

One that is good to detoxify the body, this Poached Flower Clams and Mustard Greens in a Superior Broth ($20) is a perfect complement to the other appetizers. The clams were firstly poached in the superior seafood broth before the addition of the mustard greens, Chinese rice wine and ginger. Just before it\'s being served, crumbled sole fish was added for that umami flavour.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Joyden Treasures\n<br />Address: 5, Stadium Walk, Leisure Park Kallang, Unit 02-42, Singapore 397693\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #restaurantsg #joydentreasures #sixthsensepr #sixthsensepreats
If the appetizers are done right, it whets your appetite in anticipation, done wrong and it can be the beginning of a bad dining experience. At Joyden Treasures, what better way to start a meal than to have the Teochew-styled Chilled Yellow Roe Crab (market price), one of the newest dishes in the menu. By sticking closely to the philosophy of preparing food in a way that allows the natural essence of the produce to shine through, the Yellow Roe Crab is prepared by first poaching it in a ginger and spring onions broth before cooling to room temperature and lastly chilling it in the fridge. This helps to retain the freshness of the seafood and lock in its natural flavours. Served straight out of the chiller, you can either have it as it is or dip it into the sweet plum sauce or minced ginger vinegar mix. My recommendation is to have it plain which you can get to enjoy the sweetness from the crabs.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Joyden Treasures\n<br />Address: 5, Stadium Walk, Leisure Park Kallang, Unit 02-42, Singapore 397693\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #restaurantsg #joydentreasures #sixthsensepr #sixthsensepreats
The trusty chinese restaurant celebrates its second anniversary by rolling out over 20 new dishes from fresh and live seafood in authentic Cantonese style at their Kallang Leisure Park Outlet.
A well braised smooth and crunchy sea cucumber paired with shiitake mushrooms. The gravy is robust, slightly gelatinous with good umami flavour.\n<br />.\n<br />As the gravy is not overly heavy, you can actually taste a touch of bitterness in the Pomelo Pith, which is good to balance this rich dish. Usually bamboo pith is used for this dish, but I think Pomelo Pith made a perfect substitute.\n<br />.\n<br />The full review of Prosperity Pomelo Feast is available at chubbybotakkoala.com .\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala  #burpple\n<br />#joydenconcepts #braisedseacucumber  #joydentreasures #seafoodsg  #cnydinner2017 #cny2017 #whati8today #whatiate #sgtraditions #festive2017 #festivemeal #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgigfoodie #sgblogger #singaporerestaurant #singaporerestaurants #thefoodjournalsg #omysg #omyblog #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore

What about you? 😃 •
😁 •\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />• Hosted by @sixthsensepr , tasting together with the traditional media, thank you Sixth Sense Cheryl for this invite 😍 •
(Mostly around$4.50++ for 3 pieces)\n<br />Didn\'t manage to get a good shot because was too hungry. Dim sum wasnt bad just certain items were quite miniature. Very friendly aunty staff who joked around. Didn\'t try the main menu because price range is not targeted at the unemployed. Maybe next time :P\n<br />#dimsum #cantonese #joyden #kallang #sgfood #sgfoodie #chinesefood #sgrestaurant #burpplesg #burpple
Brown Sugar Ma-La-Gao ($4.20)
The quick jump into hot oil after an arduous simmering process resulting in fall off the bone duck dish hiding under supremely crisp skin. Eat this on its own or stuff it between the soft lips of a steamed lotus shaped buns with alternating sheets of homemade pickled papaya and fresh cucumber for optimum hedonism. No words are required as you exchange pleasantries with the bird in front of you.\n<br />.\n<br />#eatoutsg #burpple #hungrygowhere #igsg #singaporeinsiders #sipandgulp #joydentreasures #8dayseat
utterly impressed, very delicious. drink that soya bean soup.
Great weather for sleeping and also a piping hot bowl of this ::Orh Nee:: from #JoydenTreasures || 🦄 best part about having it here is that it\'s available per bowl basis, meaning that if you\'re surrounded by health conscious nuts, you can still have your yam paste and rub it in their faces！～ For those of you who are wondering, Joyden\'s version is pretty good with steamed pumpkin slices and crispy water chestnuts bits chuck in there amidst remnants of lard. Still, tbh, Thai Village\'s rendition retains the throne figure in my heart. \n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #sgfoodporn #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodporn #8dayseat #orhnee #yampaste #igsg #sgfoodies #hungrygowhere #burpple
Pass me a bowl already。
That homemade sambas chilli is CRAZY GOOD！
Creamy, smooth, yammish and the addition of chestnut bits gives playful levels of crunch and Scallion oil to provide an added level of smoothness :)\n<br />#orhnee #yampaste #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #joydentreasures

Simply delish their signature braised fish and seafood fried vermicelli.👌
