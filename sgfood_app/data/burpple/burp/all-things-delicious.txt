With fresh avocado, cherry tomatoes, braised shimeiji and a 6-min egg on Japanese rice „Äã$16.90
Heard raves about their food especially their desserts so just had to head down in for the meeting momma\'s birthday! The food was good and fresh but felt the sourdough bread will a lil too hard for my liking. Was hard to cut up due to the hard crusts but taste was wasn\'t affected, just the experience. Their signature sugee cake came highly recommended by friends and wasn\'t disappointed! So go try it! A good vibrant cafe!
Japanese flavours in my #ricebowl with soy glazed salmon, braised shimeiji and 6min #onsenegg. I was disappointed by the pathetic slivers of #avocado, but it was a yummy dish nevertheless! #xuannyeatsclean #burpple
The ambience is great. Nice decor. Food was above our expectations. It\'s of western style breakfast menu with Moroccan flavours to it. Enjoyable meal.
Usually seeing sticky &amp; pudding in the same menu item sells itself to me. üòçDespite the hefty price tag, this sticky, decadent (and definitely fatteningüòÇ) puddin from was worth the calories!
Sticky Toffee Pudding ($13.90)
Went exploring around Haji Lane area and decided to give the scones a try after reading the reviews. The Orange Cranberry Scone ($3.50) isnt that floury and is just right, just a lil sweet but not too bad. The cranberry and the orangey icing hmmmmm!!! The place is quite nice to hang out with friends or just stone by yourself (like what i did). There are also more cakes that i have yet to try (also halal!) And would come back again!
Tried these when they were still at Crawford Lane and now they\'ve moved to a bigger and nicer place!\n<br />The cranberry scone was as good as I remembered: not the floury kind but more crisp and airy, yet no less buttery and fragrant.\n<br />Also had their rice bowl and western-styled breakfast. Very friendly staff here!\n<br />Will definitely be back!
\nCompared to the appetising sandwiches I\'ve had here so far, this didn\'t delight me as much. The sweetish salmon flakes, mushrooms, baby tomatoes and creamy avocado were fine when eaten separately but didn\'t harmonise to my liking when I ate them together. I did think the egg was a nice change from the usual onsen kind though. Cooked firmer but retaining a reasonably soft yolk (it wasn\'t at the hard-till-can-crumble stage) meant it formed a substantial component in the rice bowl. On another note, the rice was a bit too wet that day but it\'s probably a one-off incident.\n<br />As healthy as this dish is, I\'d rather stick to their sandwiches. They seem to suit my tastebuds better. 
\"Please make it more spicy\", I said, and they did. The extra chilli flakes took the already loaded tuna melt to another level. I really liked there was also a generous amount of chopped onions mixed in with the spicy mayo tuna hidden under the thick blanket of hot, oozing cheese. Deeply satisfying sandwich.
\nThe Sriracha chicken filling was a true delight as they didn\'t wimp out on the spiciness of it. Boosting the appeal of this sandwich (it\'s hot-pressed before being served) was the generous amount of crunchy carrot slaw and thick slices of cheddar. The olive oil panini I had today was a little dry but the plentiful creamy slaw helped to compensate for it.\n
Previously sharing a space with Fictive Fingers at Crawford Lane, All Things Delicious has relocated to a swanky new pad at Arab Street, just across the road from The Hangar. Swing by to pick up a Flat White ($5.20) to go in the morning, although it\'d be hard to resist ordering a slice of something sweet from the glorious spread of enticing cakes by the window. Its all-white interior and marble tables make it a picture-perfect setting to catch up with a girlfriend over small bites at tea time. Get the Sea Salt Caramel Brownie ($6.90) to share. The dense chocolatey slab is peppered with coarse sea salt granules and slathered with caramel for a glossy finish. Also try the light and crumbly Orange Cranberry Scone ($3.50) that pairs perfectly with tea. Finish off with the Affogato ($8.20) ‚Äî presented in a not-so-traditional way (single shot espresso served on the side), it\'s the ultimate hot-cold dessert that packs a mean caffeine punch too.\n<br />*Halal-certified\n<br />Avg price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Raine Liu
All the pastries were definitely on point but my favourite would be the Sea Salt Brownie - chocolaty goodness with a hint of saltiness. Other favourites include the Gula Melaka Scone or the Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Cake üòã and not forgetting the visually pleasing Afforgato - vanilla ice cream of mild sweetness with espresso.
Really loved this crumbly scone from this peaceful little cafe. It was just sweet enough and not dense or heavy. Actually, everything we tried was great, and it was super hard to pick from the beautiful display of cakes. I would also recommend the brownie at the back there, along with the very big cup of long black I had.
If scones aren\'t very much your thing (I have heard their Gula Melaka scone is üëåüèª), there are plenty of cakes to choose from such as loaf cakes, cream cakes and these little bundts (they also have sandwiches if you are hungry). The lemon bits atop the sugar glazing gives the fluffy butter cake a little zesty tinge of flavour that teases the tastebuds ‚Äî something pretty apt to pair with a cup of tea for a tea-time treat! And be ready for those blueberries to squirt its berry-sweetness as you give them a bite; definitely gives a little more contrast in the overall flavour profile of the cake.
Randomly visited the new space of and all things delicious after seeing their closed shop space at Blk 462 Crawford Lane ‚Äî turned out they have moved not too far away to 34 Arab Street. Remembered having a savoury scone once from their old space, and this was indeed the scone I was craving for; savoury from the melted cheese with a light and fluffy interior unlike those that comes a little too dense and rock-hard. The insides also contains bits of caramalised onions, so you get a little tinge of sweetness with every bite.
Nothing beats a warm scone with a cup of tea in the afternoon, especially one from And All Things Delicious which is famed for their scones. This savoury scone is delightful with its light saltiness despite the use of cheese in this variant, which is pretty crisp and fluff inside and easy to bite. Have I also mentioned that they have since finished renovating and now features a full dine-in area for patrons who want to eat their bakes in the cafe and even serves hot food now? Definitely worth a revisit if you hadn\'t been back there in a while! 
Always loved the quality of their bakes here; the Gula Melaka Cake was dense but moist enough to make you go on and on. Gula Melaka flavours was definitely strong, well complimented by the buttercream which was thick though a wee bit oily. Get away with that, the cake feels and tasted like a giant ondeh ondeh for you could feel the fibres and the same familiar sweetness. Very delicious indeed.
They are in the midst of expanding the menu and dine-in area, worth a visit if you happen to be around Jalan Sultan
And All Things Delicious offers a wide variety for Halal-certified bakes such as brownies, cakes and scones. Their scones are definitely worth having, with flavours like orange cranberry and gula Melaka ($5 for 2), and their beautiful display of cakes and baked treats will just leave you with the hardest decisions. Get their Sticky Toffee Pudding ($5.90) and Crackly Top Brownie, you won\'t regret it. The bakers here insist on using unprocessed and organic ingredients in order to make their bakes taste more \"\"natural\"\". This certainly shows, as diners get to enjoy clean yet flavourful treats. \n<br />*Halal-certified
And All Things Delicious now has a beautiful bakery amidst the old HDB flats in Lavender. Never miss the scones, they have interesting flavours ‚Äì orange cranberry scones and gula melaka scones. Read more : http://www.misstamchiak.com/20-halal-cafes-in-singapore/
If you don\'t have a sweet tooth, this Cheese and Onion Scone has your name on it. Heat it up in the toaster oven to bring forth its tantalising fragrance better but let it cool slightly before eating. Otherwise, the moisture within gives it a cake-like texture (which kind of defeats the purpose of eating a scone).
Fact: The scones from \"And All Things Delicious\" are selling like hot cakes because they\'re crumbly yet light, and come in flavours that actually taste very good. This Gula Melaka Scone is my newest favourite. In the hands of the experienced owner-baker, the amount of Gula Melaka drizzled over the scones is just right. 
A very new bakery at #462crawfordlane. I did not try it as I was still full from a buffet. I promise to try it the next time!I LOVE anything banana together with butter! üòçüòç
Freshly baked on the premises at \"And All Things Delicious\" every morning, these triangular shaped cranberry-filled beauties get a refreshing citrus lift from the gorgeous orange glaze. Because they use actual orange zest in it, the aroma and flavour of the glaze is remarkably strong and pure.\n<br />Personally, I have always been turned off by icky-sticky, starchy scones so the airily light and crumbly texture of these ones is perfect. Highly recommended.\n
And All Things Delicious is Tolido\'s Espresso Nook\'s newest neighbour, which offers a wide variety for halal-certified bakes such as Gula-Melaka Scones, Brownies and Galettes. The baker insists on using unprocessed ingredients such as unsalted butter  organic ingredients so as to make their bakes taste more \"natural\" and it shows; clean yet flavourful treats indeed. They also share their shop space with Fictive Fingers that does pretty decent handprinted textile designs, if anyone is interested.
Crispy and served hot, similar to the one we like to order at Nando\'s. We were full from our mains but kept on munching these. Super addictive.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #foodie #halalfood #halalfoodie #halalsg #hungrygowhere #sgfood #sgig #singaporefood #bugis #arabstreet #allthingsdelicioussg #sweetpotatofries #srirachamayo
Weekend specials: A middle eastern stew of peppers, tomatoes, 2 eggs and decent scoop of creme fraiche. Toasted home made sourdough on the side. The soft eggs and creme fraiche smoothen everything in the stew, each spoon is so divinely tasty and goes so well with the toast. The chilli flakes is a hint of kick to this dish. Really can eat this all day. Price at $18.90.
It was not my first time trying Earl Grey Creme Brulee, but the intense Dilmah Earl Grey was well complemented by the sweet caramel crust, fennel seed biscotti and tangy berries on the side. If you are not into tea-inspired dishes, but still an avid tea drinker, their gula melaka scones went surprisingly well with Dilmah Pure Green Tea. Though I would prefer a slightly more dense and moist scones, their light crumbly texture is better suited for the tea pairing.\n<br />*\n<br />I was so delighted to enjoy tea and tea-inspired dished outside tea-time thanks to Dilmah Tea Inspired Award that motivates cafes and restaurants to appreciate tea more. Dilmah Tea Inspired Awards runs from 1st June to 31st July where participating cafes and restaurants are competing to showcase their best tea-inspired creations.

My heart was captured by the orange cranberry scone!
Love the #tender chicken breast! The highlight is really the #delicious sauce that\'s slightly #spicy and it reminded me of #thaigreencurry. Would have been perfect if portion was bigger to match the price we paid!

Wow, they serve their affogato with two shots of espresso! Ice cream was lovely, and so was this presentation. Certainly something I\'d order again.
