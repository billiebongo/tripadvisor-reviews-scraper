Rice was very well cooked and you can still eat the rice bit by bit. 
Finally got to try the Salmon Mentai Don ($10 for regular size) after hearing so much about this place. Salmon sashimi slices were torched and charred to perfection, which worked in tandem with the creamy yet slightly spicy dollop of mentaiko sauce atop. The Japanese rice here was commendable too — vinegary enough to cut through the heaviness of the other ingredients without being too acidic. For $10, the quality that one gets for this dish here is definitely a steal! Can\'t wait to be back to try out their other offerings (their maki\'s maybe?)!
$10.00\n<br />I loved everything about this dish. From the tender and melt-in-your-mouth charred salmon slices, to the non-overpowering mentaiko mayonnaise, to one of the most flavorful and perfectly cooked Japanese vinegar rice, to the chilli flakes which gave spiciness to the whole dish, this affordable Mentai Don is really out of this world. I\'m already craving for more and if you\'re hungry, I\'ll recommend getting the Large sized one instead, which is only $3 more than the original. 
Cycled through the rain to get here. Totally worth it. The regular is a little small for me so I went for the upsize which made it 13.00. Love the vibe here.\n<br />Coming back for the curry next time.
amidst the nail salons, massage parlours and vegetarian food stalls of Fortune Centre lies this amazing stall. i had never stepped foot in there before and i would have never ventured inside if not for this. the mentai salmon don ($10 for small, $13 for upsized) is a flavour explosion with aburi-ed salmon covered in umami mentaiko mayo. each bite is a salty, creamy, fishy delight and i think i must have polished off the bowl in about 3 minutes. the rice has quite a strong vinegary taste, which helped it to stand up to the rich flavour of the salmon. it was pretty good on its own too! will be back stat.
was searching on burpple to find some good food at bugis and i came across this place! went down for dinner and the food was damn 👍👍👍👍 ordered the mentai don for myself, salmon don for friend and ebi gyoza for sharing. mentai don was really good! friend said the rice was delicious and i agree. will be back there again to try their sushi!!!! waiting time was quite long, around 20plus-30 mins?? but worth it ☺️, maybe cos it\'s on a friday night.
$5.50 for 6 pieces. something different from the usual pork gyoza. not too bad :-)
I\'m a big fan of mentaiko sushi so I definitely recommend this. 👍🏻\n<br />•\n<br />Located at fortune plaza and near Rochor MRT, and priced at $10 nett, how to beat such a deal like this?! 😱\n<br />•\n<br />Comment on your fav Japanese place!

Located on the third floor of Fortune Centre, this shop selling tasty and affordable Japanese dishes is a popular lunch stop for many working or studying in the area.  Burpple Tastemaker Amanda Liu adores the Salmon Mentai Don ($10) that comes with \"generous slices of salmon and mentaiko lightly torched over a bed of Japanese rice\", perfect for a quick lunch. Portions run small, but you can either upsize the bowl ($12) or fill up on other satisfying items. Order the wildly addictive Salmon Kama Karaage ($6) to share with a friend — the dish sees uncommonly used parts of the fish such as the fin. Alternatively, have the consistently good Pork Katsu Curry Rice ($7), one of the five varieties of curry available.The golden fried cutlet is placed atop a heap of rice with curry sauce on the side, so you can choose to either smother or dip.\n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Amanda Liu
Only found out about this place after the video went viral on Facebook and we eent the next day to try it at Fortune Center.
And my face not small okay?🙈\n<br />S$13 Nett from @japanesecurryexpress\n<br />😋\n<br />When I was recommended their chawanmushi, I didn\'t expect the price nor the size! After all, \"chawan-mushi\" literally means \"steamed in a tea cup\". But this version came in a huge soup bowl!\n<br />😋\n<br />Steamed only upon order, expect to wait a good 20mins. But you will get a very smooth and piping hot steamed egg custard with scallop, prawns and mushroom topped with chilli oil and ebiko. Though the scallop was a tad overcooked imo, this is still one of the better chawanmushi out there. Good for sharing!\n<br />😋\n<br />Japanese Curry Express\n<br />190 Middle Road, Fortune Centre 03-04,\n<br />S188979\n<br />Mon to Sat: 11.30am to 8.30pm\n<br />+65 9689 6314
💸 $12\n<br />When my friend first told me that we were going to Fortune Centre to eat, I was apprehensive because Fortune Centre, with its dilapidated exterior sure did not look like a place where one can find good Japanese food. 🤔 But I\'ve learned not to be too quick to judge for often, we find such food gems in the most unexpected places.
Satisfying experience, which we concluded was because of the amazing cooking of their Jap rice :) Sticky yet defined sushi rice, with just the right bite and vinegar amount! 
Went to check this place out due to the reviews it got. However, it was quite disappointing for me. Maybe their signature dishes were their makis but it was out of stock after 2pm. \n<br />Dishes above are the salmon mentai don and pork katsu curry rice. The salmon mentai don costs $10. Portions are really small :( taste was average. The pork katsu curry rice costs $7. It tasted better than the salmon mentai- more worth the money.
Trying out a new place today before school. Salmon mentai don($10) wasn\'t bad., except it\'s a little spicy cos they have added Japanese chilli powder which left me sweating by the time I finished it(can\'t take spice cos I\'m noob HAHAHA). Salmon mentai maki($9.50 for 6 pieces) was decent in freshness, taste and size, though I think sushi bar\'s salmon aburi is still unbeatable in terms of flavor. However, the selling point of this place is their really affordable prices and decent meals which makes up for its lack of ambience.
Finally tried the salmon mentai don ($10) after it has been raved about for so long!!!! As well as the pork katsu ($7)!!!! Honestly in terms of the quality of the food, this place does deliver. The pork katsu was crispy and tender with a thin yet flavorful curry that goes with the rice and the salmon mentai don was creamy, generous with the salmon and packed with a punch. I enjoyed the food thoroughly although due to the fact that my expectations for ambience did not match with that of the place, perhaps I will not visit again. 
Though not the cheapest around, we were quite willing to pay for an authentic-tasting, no frills and satisfying Aburi Don yum. 
With generous slices of salmon &amp; mentaiko lightly torched over a bed of Japanese rice, this bowl of pocket friendly quick fix is the go-to whenever you\'re craving for a good rice bowl! 
An affordable place for dinner. Cheap and delicious, that\'s what you can get from this place 👍🏼
Tiny size Don if we did not upsize ,Don is nice ,salmon is fresh ,overall quite satisfied :)
Looked really good in pictures but was so turned off by the tiny size in real life.
Located on the third floor of Fortune Centre, this shop selling tasty and affordable Japanese dishes is a popular lunch stop for many working or studying in the area. The Pork Katsu Curry Rice ($7), one of the five varieties of curry available, is a reliable option. The golden, fried cutlet is placed on a heap of rice with brown curry sauce alongside, so you can choose to smother or dip. Another popular choice is the Salmon Mentai Don ($10) — thick-cut slices of salmon flame-torched for that hint of smokiness, topped with a generous dollop of mentaiko mayo. The portion runs small, so you might want to share a side of the super crispy, addictive Salmon Kama Karaage ($6) which utilizes parts of the fish such as the head and the fin, with your lunch companion!\n<br />Avg price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Greedy Pals
The blowtorched pieces of salmon are fresh and went well with the well-seasoned Japanese rice 😍 Portions run small and the shopfront looks rather worn down but for the nett prices, I\'ll definitely be back!
Salmon Kara Karaage ($6)
Hidden away in Fortune Centre, Japanese Curry Express serves up really great, no frills Japanese food! 🇯🇵
I can have this all day long. I love the thick generous slices I get from this small eatery at fortune centre.  Prices are affordable and food is freshly prepared. Recommended.
Really yummy comfort food when you don\'t know what to eat for lunch. If you are working around the vicinity, do check this shop out! It is really yummy, pork katsu usually sold out by afternoon!! Fortune centre has a lot of food variety from Hongkong to vegetarian, Korean and Japanese!! And it is pocket friendly!! 😽
Filled with cheese, scallop, prawn &amp; kani. The cheesy taste is strong. 
This has officially become my favourite sushi. Avocado &amp; unagi is just the best combination ever. On the left is unagi out avocado in, on the right is avocado out unagi in. They actually taste different, i usually go for avocado out when I crave for avocado and when I don\'t, i will go for unagi out. 
I requested the cucumber to be changed to kani because I don\'t like cucumber. Favourite maki
A surprisingly delicious find! Smooth, fragrant and flavorful, the tasty curry wasn\'t too rich but yet perfect paired with rice or on its own. The pork cutlet was fried beautifully, still retaining the moisture of the meat. My only complain would be that the meat is too thin....
We had the chicken and fish katsu curry ($7.00) respectively and it was good! 😁😁 #burpple #japanesecurry #curryrice

Tucked away on the third floor of Fortune Centre, the name “Japanese Curry Express” may raise some eyebrows. But look beyond it, and you\'d be surprised to find a gem in a little quiet building.\n<br />.\n<br />Fresh salmon slices cover a bowl of well seasoned sushi rice, topped with thick dollop of mentaiko torched to perfection, and sprinkled with furikake bits and chilli powder. A bite into the salmon slices smeared my lips with mentaiko sauce because they were so generous with it that it was like gooey thick cream mixing with the meat in my mouth. The resulting Salmon Mentai Don ($14 for large, though wish bowl was bigger) exudes smoky flavours, giving a slightly peaty fragrance. This gem definitely Don disappoint ;)\n<br />_______________\n<br />Fortune Centre \n<br />#03-04\n<br />190 Middle Road\n<br />Singapore 188979\n<br />Opens 11.30am -2.30pm, 5.30pm - 8.30pm daily.

Salmon Mentaiko don for Dinner
😅 Last night\'s #takeaway #mentai #aburi #salmon don #dinner from a place I\'ve been wanting to try that is known for #affordable #ricebowls. At SGD$14, in terms of value for money I think it\'s just average, in terms of quantity and taste. But it\'s #yummy and convenient enough and I wouldn\'t mind having it again! 😊✌ #japanesecurryexpress #donburi #food #foodpics #foodstagram #burpple #instafood #sgeats #whati8 #foodsg #sgfood
Nice Mentai don! Went really early and no one was there, but it became pretty crowded after we ordered. P. S. for those going early, there isnt sushi till 12.30pm. So we didnt get to try the sushi &gt;
Fresh salmon sliced and torched with Mentaiko mayo. At only $10 per bowl (upsize for $2), this is definitely a steal! No wonder this has become one of the more popular go-to places for Jap food. Do note that they tend to sell out 1/2 hours before closing (Maki was sold out when we tried to order), so come down early!\n<br />.\n<br />#makandaydream \n<br />#bugis\n<br />#japanese\n<br />#mentaiko\n<br />#salmon\n<br />#salmondon\n<br />#burpple\n<br />#burpplesg\n<br />#sgfood\n<br />#sgfoodies\n<br />#sgfoodporn\n<br />#sgeats\n<br />#hungrygowhere\n<br />#8dayseat\n<br />#stfoodtrending\n<br />#foodinsing
That blop of mentaiko on the perfectly aburi-ed salmon was an awesome combination, and the vinegar sushi rice made it less gelat. The only issue was the long waiting time, but this salmon mentaiko bowl made up for it 😍😍 Buy the upsized version though, the normal bowl is damnnn tiny. \n<br />#exploresingapore #sgig #burpple #burpplesg #salmonmentaiko #aburisalmon #japanesecurryexpress #mentaiko #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgeats #whati8today #onthetable #japanese #roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition

🐟🍚\n<br />•\n<br />That\'s right! Japanese curry express salmon mentaiko don serves it just right. The flame grilled salmon was really soft, placed on top on the Japanese white rice. OMG I am in mentaiko heaven now. 😱\n<br />•\n<br />It was really really good! Maybe because I loved the taste of the flame grilled salmon. Yummy! 👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />The bowl is a little small, so there\'s an additional $3 charge to upsize it (Ps; Will totally upgrade the next time) 👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />Have a good Tuesday everyone!
