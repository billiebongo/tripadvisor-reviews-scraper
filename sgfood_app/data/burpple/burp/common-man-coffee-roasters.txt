One would use the phrase \"not very common\" to describe the prices but it doesn\'t seem to deter the crowds. I preferred their poached eggs but this is a pretty interesting brunch choice, which a phyllo wrapped egg and hummus. 
If ya need a strong caffeine kick, this is the place to be! Ambiance is great tooü§ó though it\'s a more pricey than usual...
Orechiette pasta with squid bolognese with chopped basil, pancetta and shaved pecorino. It doesn\'t taste wonderful and can get jelat after half the portion.
Tastes okay. Avocado could be riper. Cold brew coffee came with orange peel which was nice. Ambience is probably the best thing about that place.
Went for a sweet item on the menu for brunch today: Fluffy brioche french toast with a berry compote drizzled on top and completed with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. ($18) Love that the brioche is sufficiently thick to soak up all the eggy goodness and toasted till it\'s edges are nice and brown. It\'s been a while since I\'ve last had french toast and my old love for them is rekindling. üòçüçû The organic eggs benedict ($24) had poached eggs on ox cheek and english muffin on a bed of arugula. Personally found the ox meat rather tough, would have preferred alternative proteins for this dish that is leaner and not require that much effort with all the chewing.
A simple and elegant cake. We like that it\'s served warm with distinctive citrusy fragrance and delicate orange taste that\'s not too sour.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Candle added because we were celebrating a birthday :)
Starting my Saturday right with this wholesome brunch brightened by appetite-inducing colours in a cafe filled with uplifting vibes.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Pictured here are Saut√©ed Kale and Egg White Scramble [$19 + $7 grilled spicy chicken], Common Man Veggie Wonderland [$25], Common Man Full Breakfast [$25], Cappuccino, Flat White, Latte [$5 each] and Cold Brew [$8]. And my favourite? The Kale!\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Both the food and coffee is good, and that explains the queue. And a tip from @luckykyut who makes the great coffee here - the best time to visit on weekends is at 3pm.
Common man full breakfast x Organic eggs Benedict
Love to treat myself to brunch and feel a bit fancy. And when the inspiration hits, CMCR is the place to do it! The menu is creative and made with quality ingredients although the price tag matches this extravegence. I went with the pea fritters with poach eggs and panceta on a bed of rocket. Surprisingly peppery but otherwise delicious! The decor is modern and interesting and the service fantastic. An excellent spot to meet up with friends or for a solitary treat!
There\'s a literal carrot patch that had a carrot growing from the cake. A+ for decoration and ingenuity!
Came here for good quality coffee and seductive french toast. üòã
This is a common man full breakfast, not a common man portion and it keeps a common man full! The portion is huge, which partly explains the price tag.
\nThis did not turn out like anything I\'d expected. But I am not complaining!
Just imagine‚Ä¶ luscious brioche French toast served on a wooden board with vibrant berries compote, premium maple syrup, smooth Kapiti vanilla ice cream and dusted icing sugar.
What an interesting thing, grilled cake. Anyway it\'s just like any other sponge cake that came with a delicious scoop of caramel ice cream. Great accompaniment with their bitter coffee. 
The best part of the meal? The fries, then followed by the burger. Maybe coz I had such a good hamburg steak recently. I would make a trip back here for the fries and yes of course, the ambience. 
It sounded like everything under the sun was thrown onto these pancakes but they all melded together into a glorious mess. The pancakes were fluffy and light. And very surprisingly, despite the numerous elements, it wasn\'t too sweet. Score. 
Doesn\'t look too flattering, but this French toast will blow your mind away. Wholly drenched in the luscious egg mix, then pan-fried to a char, the slices of brioche were moist and fluffy on the inside, every bite melting into buttery-eggy goodness. If you\'re a fan of the sweet brunch item, be sure to give this a try on your next visit.
Here\'s a place that requires advance planning, what with the never-ending stream of customers on weekends and fairly inaccessible public transport. If you don\'t drive, it is best to have your friends convene at Dhoby Ghaut to share a cab to Martin Road (it costs around $4.50). Everything\'s good, albeit slightly pricey, but we say zoom in on the Turkish Common Man Breakfast ($25) ‚Äî phyllo-wrapped soft boiled eggs that reveal golden molten centres, served on a bed of velvety hummus. Olives and beautifully breaded and fried feta add a good salty punch, while cucumbers and tomatoes keep it fresh. Get your hands dirty and grab the pita to mop up the glorious mess. Alternatively, go for the crowdpleasing Organic Eggs Benedict ($24, opt for sourdough). The two poached eggs are stacked atop unbelievably tender braised ox cheeks and drizzled with chive hollandaise. Be sure to save space for the Fluffy Brioche French Toast ($18) ‚Äî two slices of super eggy brioche served with Kapiti ice cream and berries compote ‚Äî so simple yet so worth its steep price. Have the baristas recommend which filter coffee to try; if not, the Flat White ($5) seals the deal just fine.
Ok I think the price is insane for berries, toast and ice cream but when I tasted it.....just take my money. So darn good even though it\'s so simple. After all that\'s what you want from a French toast right? Suuuuper egg soaked bread and nice tart berries with good quality ice cream. Must order to end your meal!
You can\'t go wrong with this. Still loving the orangey hue of organic eggs, and the tender ox cheeks below. Hearty üòã
If you love hummus, this is for you! You can\'t see it but it is smeared nice and thick in the plate, perfect for scooping up with all that pita. The fried golden orb is a beautifully runny egg inside, while the ball you see on the right is breaded and fried balls of feta!! Super satisfying plate.
This is for those who want something hearty AND full of veggies for brunch: the Veggie Wonderland ($25) that has two free-range organic eggs of yo\' choice on sourdough (got poached because poached eggs are life), halloumi, spinach, grilled tomatoes, portabello mushrooms, sliced avocado w/ lemon &amp; chilli!!!!! üåø
The Fluffy brioche French toast ($18) definitely lived up to its name, and together with the sour berries compote and sweet Kapiti vanilla ice cream, is the ideal decadent breakfast treat that you should totally treat yourself to! üòè
I absolutely loved the Organic Eggs Benedict ($24); two perfectly poached eggs (with gorgeous orange-y yolks) with chive hollandaise and ox cheeks on sourdough bread surrounded by rocket leaves. Breaking the yolk was a delight, and I happily mopped everything up with the bread. ‚ò∫
Come early in the day to snag a seat at this award-winning coffee house before digging into the crowd favourite Organic Eggs Benedict ($24). Sink your teeth into tender braised ox cheeks set on artisanal sourdough toast with two perfectly poached eggs. The organic eggs produce super orangey yolks ‚Äî quite a stunning sight! Instead of the acidic house blend, have the baristas recommend what other coffee beans are available for your caffeine boost. 
In need for some greens and decided to try out their Veggi Wonderland, must say it\'s really tasty! üòã #vegetarian #burpple
The kind of breakfast that never fail to put a smile on my face!
I have to say it\'s one of the best brunch meals I\'ve ever had. It is nutritionally balanced for vegetarians, extremely yummy and worth every dollar. The halloumi cheese is to die for. 
; First Look at Neh-presso  So when two separate entities @commonmancoffee and @nehnehpopsg, each great at what they do, proceeded to create this creamsicle, my inner Joy-character (you\'ll know if you\'ve watched Inside Out) was mad waving them pom-poms doing insane somersaults in celebration of what was to be created. And a couple of months later, now here it is:
Other than the pita bread, everything else was on point üôÜüèª Especially that haloumi cheeeeseeee
You can request anything from the grinders at no extra charge.
Ardi Sidama, Ethiopia, is where this special filtered brew reigns from. Exaggerated fruit tones, dark chocolate, blueberry, cherry, and a floral aftertaste. Was honestly quite nice and refreshing and it sets itself apart from normal coffee brews. My only qualm with this is that there aren\'t much tastes of anything remotely coffee-ish. If you\'re into fruity coffee, you\'d like this. And IMHO, for $6 it\'s not too bad for a cuppa. 
Waited 20 minutes for this. When it arrived, looked kind of stale. First bite, wasn\'t impressed. Second bite, still not impressed. The cake was powdery, the gula melaka was powdery as well. The taste of the pandan had hints of coconut, which were nice. But it could not salvage the overall disappointment I had with this, IMHO not worth the $9. Coffee\'s good though =]
I enjoy going here solo with my book having a breakfast that makes me feel at home again (in Australia) and just chilling. The food is SO great. 
You probably have seen this a thousand times, but did you realise that they actually have THREE oozy dishes to indulge in here? First, the super simple and satisfying Croissant Croque Monsieur that oozes with melted Provolone and creamy bechamel. Second, the bright orange eggs yolks of the Organic Eggs Ben that sit atop braised ox cheeks, seeping gently into the hollandaise for a rich mouthful. Third, the Turkish Breakfast\'s phyllo-wrapped soft boiled egg that is both adorable and irresistibly crunchy on the outside. Well, you\'ve got three options in one place for an oozy breakfast. Not sure what you\'re waiting for.
I have no words. Everything about this Veggie Wonderland is magical. The organic eggs were magnificent, poached to perfection and flowing with a rich sunny yolk when nudged. The halloumi was wonderful, salty and pairing well with all the components of the dish. I have no words. Incredible.
Totally addicted to the coffee here. The brunch or breakfast menu is extensive and they served organic eggs (if I m not wrong). Love the Eggs Benedict because of the generous serving of vegetables. I also like the Vegetable Wonderland especially the grilled feta cheese.
Definitely one of my faves and easily one of the best brunch spots around!
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Caf√© Hopping
[$6] Yes yes, ordering hot chocolate at a cafe which has \'Coffee Roasters\' is probably a üôÖ idea but Guess again! üòé\n<br />Especially since I\'m a Hot Chocolate fanatic (like srsly, 9/10 times of beverages ordered are Hot Chocolates, if it\'s available), I adore Common Man\'s!\n<br />A good blend of cocoa (%) and milk was used and it delivered a unique taste as compared to some of which I\'ve tried! Hmm ~  üòã\n<br />&amp;&amp; $6 is really not bad of a price too!! #cheapcheap
Awesome fresh poached eggs,  savoury meat and soft fluffy pancakes here for grabs. üç¥üëç‚òï
It\'s all about the process.  Definitely owing my latte art pulls to two guys with big hearts and immeasurable amounts of patience. To the champ barista @luckykyut of @commonmancoffee (btw, he pulled the top left cuppa) and the self-taught super humble @roodelia. Wouldn\'t have this achievement unlocked without you both. \n<br />Thanks guys!! xx
Located at 22 martin road, this cafe is not easily accessible via train/bus so do prepare to walk a distance. Most of the customers are foreigners, probably residents staying in the area. Arrived at about 10+ and the place was already half filled, chose the alfresco seats which had natural lighting (only the ones near the entrance), and which had nice wooden tables, and my fav plants üòÇüòÇ Left at 12 when the crowd started to fill the place. Items featured in the photo includes: Common Man Full Breakfast $26/ Egg benedict $24/ Latte $5/ Mocha $6. Verdict: The total bill sums up to about $70 which was on the pricey side. The egg benedict, organic eggs on tender braised ox cheeks was great. Love the ox cheeks üòç The full breakfast was not bad as well, but with its plate of bacon, sausage, hashbrowns and pork cannellini beans aside eggs, tomatoes, mushroom and toast, it became too much of a portion being on the \"meaty and salty\" side üòÖ The coffee was good though! 4.2/5.0
It ticks all the right boxes in my book of good food ‚Äî toasted sourdough, braised ox cheeks, perfectly light yet rich hollandaise, and rockets! And coffee is always great here too. Ok, that\'s all.
Super fluffy brioche french toast topped with beautifully tart berry compote, premium maple syrup and Kapiti vanilla ice cream. 
Best coffee ever. ‚òï‚òï‚òï
Churros were speckled with sugar and crisp on the exterior, yet soft inside. Comes with a luscious chocolate sauce though honestly I find it good without the dip. Worth trying.
Have heard that they serve one of the best Eggs Benedict but had been rather skeptical about it since it\'s such a mainstream dish that can be found anywhere. So wrong I was; the goodness probably lies in the organic eggs which was well poached. Unlike usual yolks, the yolks of the organic eggs seemed a tad more orangey, and tasted really fresh as compared to other Eggs Benedict I have had. The eggs sit atop a sourdough toast which is a little tough to cut but comes with a chewiness that was great in the mouth, ox cheeks which were really savoury and flavouring up the dish in a more meaty and slight gamey way than what ham and smoked salmon would do, and a creamy Hollandaise sauce goes over the eggs. Even the greens had enough dressing so it doesn\'t get too bitter. Finally understood the hype of this dish after trying out myself!
Despite its looks, the French Toast here was surprisingly unexpected without being overwhelming as though doused in sweetness. That fluffy brioche while soft, was also crusty and crisp, not only coming with a savoury touch but also slightly spiced with cinnamon, yet slight sweet from maple syrup and ice-cream with a hint of tartness from berries.
Hearty, but a little too pricey. Quoting my friend, \'why aren\'t the prices meant for the common man?\'  Nevertheless, expect quality ingredients (referring to the portobello mushrooms and organic eggs) on your plate. 
breakfast for champs, but it was actually eaten for tea. \n<br />what\'s everyday doing this fine Sunday morning ?
The two things essential to any good weekend. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
As reviews mentioned, they serve very nice coffee. It\'s has quite a toasty roast to their coffee which was a good pick me up for me after a staycation around the area. #burpple
in my opinion, it one of de best comfort food around. you serve it warm, moist and slightly crisp on the outside, with a scoop of ice cream or even a drizzle of maple. \n<br />take my money!
Fluffy brioche coated and fried in egg, topped with vanilla ice cream, berry compote, and maple syrup. The toast was done well, but the compote was far too sweet; I\'d have preferred it more tart!
I liked that the insides were a little gooey at the ends, but the middle was crispy through. 50% successful, I suppose.
Tasty all-day-breakfast. Side dishes on the higher side of value, but the churos is quite tasty not the best but if you are willing to spend around $13-15 it\'s worth a try. Great coffee with good roast. 
Fresh , light dressing , juicy pomegranate , one of my fav salads anywhere 
Chili boneless chicken with meshed avocado n comes with lemon. Although, the portion is very filling but because of the lemon that squeeze to the meat &amp; mix together creates a sour refreshing feeling that won\'t make me feel bored with the chicken. 
To go for the BEST eggs Benedict ever. I know... Skeptics you are probably wondering how nice it can be BUT trust me on this one. The eggs are cooked to pure perfection, eaten together with all the other ingredients plated... It\'s just so so good. For coffee lovers, it\'s even more reason for you to go. They treat their brews seriously. 
The folks of CMCR are dead serious about their coffee. This cafe is dedicated to making top-notch coffee available to the common man, and believes that great coffee ought to be paired with amazing grub. Start the day with their Turkish Breakfast comprising a phyllo-wrapped soft-boiled egg, crispy feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and hummus served with pita bread. Their Organic Eggs Benedict is another favourite, with a twist of tender braised ox cheeks in place of ham. For a lighter option, grab their flaky Croissant Croque Monsieur which comes stuffed with provolone cheese, ham, and amazing bechamel sauce. Plus a cup of coffee, and you\'re good to go!
This is really good and something you don\'t see often! Phyllo-wrapped soft-boiled organic egg, crispy feta, fresh cucumber and tomatoes, olives and hummus with pita bread! I\'m super impressed with their food! Chinese New Year day 2, their rocket salad is still so FRESH! Wide range of variety of food to choose from. And everything on the menu, you just want to try! This is the kind of cafe that will make me go again and again! Yes, I\'m full of praises for common man!
Well, you might want to take a chance and hope the queues are shorter during this festive period. Go for their Turkish Breakfast, Croissant Croque Monsieur, or the Braised Ox Cheeks Eggs Ben (yes it\'s hard to decide)! Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Rachel Xie #Burpple
A break from all the pineapple tarts and bak gua. Coffee for me please :)
Always hesistant to queue at CMCR on weekends? Well, you might want to take a chance and hope the queues are shorter during this festive period. Go for their Turkish Breakfast, or their Croissant Croque Monsiuer, or the Braised Ox Cheeks Eggs Ben (yes it\'s hard to decide)! 
Common man full breakfast $26. This big pallet is just nice for two paxs! Customer majority is foreigner , cosy environment make you feel like dining in other country ! 
What makes this dish uncommon is that they have a chorizo hash brown, chorizo baked beans, and Pumpkun bread. Price ain\'t too common though.  #foodporn #foodgasm #instafood #instagood #burpple #workingbrunch
Need a cup of coffee to perk me up. Gonna be a long but exciting day ahead! üòä
An excellent and healthy brunch/lunch alternative. I really  enjoyed this dish especially crunching down on the crispy kumara, and the subtle taste of coriander. 
Having the amazeballs Common Man Veggie Wonderland for our second meal of the day. Mad full after our first stop at Ronin, but amazing amazing food nonetheless.
Best churros ever. The churros that taste great even after leaving it for a while. Crispy and chewy and not too flour-ish. Matching chocolate sauce was just perfect! 
\"I think it‚Äôs very healthy to spend time alone. You need to know how to be alone and not be defined by another person\". checked.
Uncommonly big prices but good quality.  Full brek $26 coffees $5
Not too shabby. Really liked the scrambled organic eggs and beans. But it\'s little pricey at 26 dollars.
The avocado salsa was great! Those little chillies pack a punch and it\'s pretty spicy if you can\'t take the heat. A lil pricey at 25 dollars.
4 munchies: The crab salad with thick chunks of crab meat, fresh greens, pomegranate and caper crumbs in yuzu mint dressing makes a great and refreshing appetiser for the hearty brunch ahead!
Among the many cafes that dot the hip but not so public-transportation-friendly Martin Road area, my favourite has got to be Common Man Coffee Roasters. In my opinion, apart from Chye Seng Huat Hardware, their decor has got to be the coolest within the industrial chic theme. This was actually my third visit. Their coffee is strong and aromatic, but a little more to the acidic side. According to my friend who has tasted the authentic churros in Spain, their version isn\'t quite up to standard, but to an undiscerning churro eater like myself, it was good enough, even without the chocolate sauce that came along with it. During my last visit, I enjoyed their crab salad with pomegranate bits tremendously. Common Man Coffee Roasters is one of the few cafes in Singapore that take their food as seriously as their coffee. I\'ll be back to try their breakfast the next time I have access to a car. 
Think I took too long to take pictures so it became one mushy dish.
With a common man full breakfast (organic scrambled eggs, sourdough toast, back bacon, sausage, grilled tomatoes, chorizo hashbrowns, house-made chorizo baked beans and juicy portobello mushrooms) and an aromatic flat white, the breakfast I had was more than complete and satisfying. It filled not only my stomach, but my soul as well! How could I have missed this gem, really? Surely, I will return for more for to indulge in their special brew and food. 
A trip to Common Man Coffee Roasters (CMCR) on a beautiful Sunday morning reignited my love sparks for the true roast of coffee! Indeed, the true quality of good coffee lies beyond the walls of Starbucks and Coffee Bean even in a small country like Singapore. Coffee enthusiasts will not settle for a cup of coffee which does not satisfy their hunger for the true roast; one that lingers sip after sip. The last time I drank coffee of similar quality and fragrance is from Campos Coffee in Sydney. I‚Äôm so glad CMCR delivers such tasteful coffee! The constant crowd keeps the staff on their feet and gives the caf√© it\'s lively atmosphere.
Served with pita bread. A refreshing take from the usual all-day breakfast menu. Love the phyllo-wrapped soft-boiled egg with runny yolk and feta #cheese! A hearty and satisfying #breakfast. Only grouse? At $25, excluding GST &amp; service charge, this breakfast set is slightly on the steep side and definitely not \"common man\" breakfast.
Flat White, slightly on the acidic side but very very robust and flavourful.
such awesome grilled chicken especially with a \'kick\' of chillies marinated. the sides of avocado salsa is the best combination ever.
Sausage, bacon, portobello mushroom, gorgeous fluffy scrambled eggs on sourdough, tomatoes, hashbrown plus yummy chorizo baked beans üòçüòçüòç what more can I ask for? Full marks to a satisfying brunch~ I\'ll be back for sure!!
Such generous portion! Happy tummy :) 
Having an uncommon lunch on a rainy Tuesday. Always an enjoyable experience at Common Man. Eggs so fluffeh......Food prepared from the heart. 
This is just the place for a rainy day. Love the caption! Do they do it for real? ;) 
üå±üå∫üê¢ @ CMCR\'s very first green project for only $6 ! Is this real life?! So fresh and so good complete with micro greens, flowers üòè, and pomegranate dressing! Hopefully held on the 1st Sunday of every month!
Churros are crispy on the outside sprinkled with lots of sugar and cinnamon, while inside is soft chewy and mochi like.
Smooth blend light bitter and bright tone!
Organic poached eggs with orangy yokes  on top of tender braised beef cheeks
Common Man Coffee Roasters encompasses a cafe, coffee bar, and wholesale roasting arm, so you know you can trust them to always make you a great cup of coffee with stunning latte art. Besides the usual espresso based coffee, they will also be showcasing single origin coffee through filter brewing methods like the chemex and aeropress at Cafe Fest, which will definitely interest all you coffee fanatics!
Mocha was excellently brewed with a charming earthy blend. No doubt, one of the caf√©s you should visit in SG. 
My flat white cuppa. This coffee left a slightly unpleasant rough after-taste. Not as smooth as I would like it to be. A tad disappointing.
K for kopi. H for heart. O for onions. What do you see? Heart or onion?
It was literally calling me out to order it. It was interesting the egg was wrapped in phyllo then it was hidden in a mess of birds nest like thing. Sometimes I want a straw to suck out the yolk first. Haha....
This was da bomb! Halloumi! Avocado! Love this place for their great espresso drinks (more medium bodied), yummy food, and service! 
After a 45minute long wait on a sunday morning, this brunch dish lived up to its description. Portions were good and hearty, with the free ranged poached eggs well executed. The pan fried halloumi cheese provided a nice salty addition to the dish. A good option for a relatively clean meal. Overall, worth the price but not so much the wait! Would order the other dishes here in future! 
Love the ambience here and the staff were friendly as well. Had a good experience there üëçüëç
$26 albeit pricey but it\'s worth every penny because it really stands out from the various full breakfast or big breakfast that I\'ve eaten (like you won\'t feel that cheapskate stuff were used, ya know?) but the sourdough toast was a bit too hard though üôäüôä
They roast their own beans so you can expect some decent coffee here üòå
Although I always say nothing can go wrong with pulled pork but the taste of the cabbage slaw as well as the mustard was a little teeny weeny overpowering it covers the taste of the pulled pork (which was supposed to be the limelight of the burger) üò£ still good though (when you have them separately) üôä
$19 is a bit pricey for pancakes but the taste was really good, I love the mixture of Caramelized bananas and berry compote along with the crunchy walnuts and nutty crumbles. Only bad point was that the pancakes weren\'t fluffy enough. 
French toast!!! I\'m a fan of cinnamon so i really appreciate that flavor when i had my fist bite. Definitely a place i don\'t mind coming back to. The only sad thing is that they close pretty early, 7pm daily. Anyway, hope everyone is having an equally yummylicious weekend! üê∑üê∑üê∑
No thanks to Jason\'s mouthwatering pic of Corner House\'s eggs ben, I was thinking about the best eggs bens that I\'ve had and CMCR\'s Benedict\'s came to mind!
My fav cafe this far! This eggs benedict sports a twist by serving it atop some soft tender ox cheek!
This is really one of the best egg ben I have tasted!
Another love of my life - Poached eggs. I love how my eggs are runny in this sense. I love to see the half cooked egg yolks streaming down to the plate and the other dishes. And I love how healthy is it being cooked:) this is really done very well and I enjoyed every single bite in my mouth üòã I\'ll highly recommend you all to visit! 
Having enjoyed the churros a lot on her first visit to this cafe, my friend persuaded me to give it another go. This is in spite of me sharing my negative experience when I ordered it before. Reluctantly, I agreed and guess what? It turned out to be better this time. Perhaps the chef was able to focus on doing it properly because it was nearly closing time and only a handful of customers remained. 
I rarely order chicken at caf√©s and restaurants because to me, it is the least interesting of meats. However the way it\'s prepared here made me sit up and take notice. The lean chicken breast that\'s been marinated with chilli and grilled, somehow manages to remain juicy. Or at least as juicy as a chicken breast can be. With a squirt of the caramelised lemon and dollops of the crushed avocado salsa, it turned out to be a pretty satisfying dish. Healthy like nobody\'s business too.
Met a friend for an early dinner today and since we were both feeling like something light, we ordered a couple of healthier dishes to share. One of which was this salad. Thickly sliced, the baked-yet-still-juicy beetroot was a match made in heaven when paired with the savoury crumbly feta cheese. Joining in to form a threesome - the sweet, crunchy walnuts. And we certainly didn\'t complain when a pile of wild rocket leaves and honey-lemon dressing decided to gatecrash the party. Yay! 
Expect to queue on the weekends at this alluring establishment, and be prepared for a great meal. For something different, go for the Turkish Full Breakfast. If you like your runny eggs (of course you do), go for the poached organic eggs sitting atop braised ox cheeks, or the swoon-worthy Croque Monsieur. Finish off with a coffee, cider, or glass of white wine. Don\'t expect the usual cafe prices! Photo by Huixuan Tan
Do NOT be tempted by the churros here. They\'re much too heavy, dense and mealy inside, and too hard outside. Plus at $12 for 5 pieces, they are very expensive mistakes. We gave feedback to the staff and to be fair, they were very polite. However there was no service recovery, so it looks like we won\'t be heading back there anytime soon. 
The blend of Guatemala, Ethiopia and Sumatra. Bright and fruity. But with too much Sumatra in the ratio, I feel the Ethiopian beans couldn\'t stand out. Nevertheless, the milk was frothed to perfection by the champion of snbc2014, Xin. Gd job.

Beautiful swan coffee art with lovely fragrant coffee. . If not, my body can react to coffee better üò≠
Eggs benedict with a twist. No salmon or bacon or ham, but a generous portion of ox cheek with the classic hollandaise over a bed of rockets. Delicious!
Found out that this place is a 15min walk from my office. Excellent filtered coffee!
Flat White. The coffee here is really top tier. #burpple
Always loved holding the cup and it\'s spacious, airy area. Friendly stuff and a nice morning experience.
price was rather steep but the eggs ben was unusual- hence standing out from the rest. my friend ordered the pancakes instead and I thought that was the highlight and was definitely much more worth it\'s price. overall a good experience though! 
Fluffy brioche French toast, berry compote, maple syrup and kapiti vanilla ice cream. 
Instead of the typical salmon, common man serves ox cheek instead! Ox cheek was tender and flavourful! Though the bread was a little hard, it was good. Flat white was smooth with a slight tinge of sourness. Not too bad though it was really crowded!
It looks fantastic but doesn\'t taste all that good, it\'s on the more expensive side at SGD25 but the place is hip and both staff and clientele are easy on the eyes.
Can\'t remember the name of the dish but it\'s really one of the best grilled chicken I\'ve ever had. 
The full brekkie really fills u up with crispy bacon (I actually prefer them less crispy), sausage, toasted sour  dough bread (tasted like there was some olive oil and garlic rubbed into the bread), sauteed mushrooms, pork with cannellini beans, hash brown (with chopped mystery meat - tasted like a ngoh hiang said a friend) and 2 perfectly poached eggs.
Flow, my yolk, flow! | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
Everything we ate was fantastic! But I probably wouldn\'t pay to have it again | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
Reply good and simply breakfast made with the best ingredients around. I think it\'s about $20 but worth every cent. Good for sharing among 2. Got to be really hungry to have it to yourself. 
Great service and good food! Albeit a tad to the pricy side for a brunch.
First-time experience yesterday, latte was divine! Definitely one of my top 5 places for that much needed swift caffeine kick. Also tried the chocolate peppermint cake; good, but was a little too sweet for my taste. Well try the mains next time.
#latergram of yesterday\'s brunch. Common man full veggie breakfast x Eggs Benedict with ox cheeks
In need of some porn, like right now! #eggporn
First Non-Caffeine post of the day! Hot Chocolate with a pretty lovely Rosetta.
Ox Cheek Organic Eggs Benedict on Sourdough. I still prefer the Turkish common man breakfast over this!
CMCR Portobello Salad. Was expecting a whole portobello, but came out to be cut-up mushrooms.
Light, silky mouthfeel with a fresh cut aroma. Superb flavor-saturated with a clean finish. 
Ham and cheese between tiong bahru bakery croissant. Simply love TBB croissant üòç it\'s perfect with that savory touch! 
Pipping hot flat white. Lovely.
Common Man Full Breakfast &amp; Piccolo Latte... Slightly oily (esp the veges &amp; eggs) but overall this is good. Bacon is crispy and hash brown is more like a vege tempura. Posting more food photos under @coffeeandcravings (Instagram) go follow ;) #burpple #coffeeandcravings
Behind this cold looking front is a very bustling atmosphere! Awesome place! Need to come back here again!
Mango Panna Cotta with Spicy Pineapple and Creamy Coconut Yoghurt + Latte... Very interesting desserts on the menu! Tempted to try them all! This Mango Panna Cotta is a definite must try if you\'re a mango lover. Creamy &amp; flavourful. The pineapples are a little too sweet &amp; not very spicy, but overall I like this a lot! Latte was a little too watery for my liking. 
Latte ~ For the love of coffee #burpple #coffeeandcravings
Another shot of this breakfast... üòä
The hustle &amp; bustle inside Common Man Coffee Roasters. Seems that all the hip cafes have a huge centrepiece these days.

Love chilling out at this place over the weekend. One of my favourite brunch place. Good food, good coffee :)
Just the toast is too tough for my liking... And today\'s latte was a bit sourish. Apparently they mix and blend their beans daily so taste changes accordingly.
Creme Caramel. A dense caramel pudding in a sticky swamp of caramel sauce and milk jam - a generous helping of toasted almonds add crunch. #pudding #caramel #almonds #dessert #sweet #sugarhigh #happyfood #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
Common Man Burger. Freshly ground ribeye mince  patty on caramelised onions and topped with melted provolone cheese, between fluffy brioche buns and served with fries. Super tasty, but you gotta whack it while it\'s hot or the cheese and beef will get stiff. #burger #beef #fries #comfortfood #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
Organic Eggs Benedict. This rendition one-ups the perennial favourite brunch classic by substituting the usual ham or salmon with tender, red wine-braised ox cheek on sourdough bread. 
Turkish Common Man Breakfast. The highlight of this dish is the crispy, bird\'s nest-like wisps of sweet phyllo cradling a soft-boiled egg, but also delicious are it\'s accompaniments of crumbed, deep-fried feta cheese with flat bread and hummus. So much more unique than poached eggs on toasted muffins yet with just the same amount of satisfying ooze. #brunch #breakfast #eggs #flatbread #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Great start to the weekend with a superb breakfast! Love the buzz in here ‚òï‚òï #coffee #breakfast #cafe
Exhilaratingly aromatic with a savory hint of sandalwood and roasted cacao. Flavor rings into a deep, sweet finish.  
Succulent ribeye steak burger with provolone, grilled tomatoes, caramelised onions, and pickled guindilla on a fluffy brioche bun and fries.
My Common Man Rib-eye Burger and Fries. Lately been having too much burgers.
Every common day should be a brunch day!
Turkish Common Man Breakfast for the local Singaporean. Phyllo-wrapped soft boiled organic eggs, crispy feta, fresh cucumber &amp; tomatoes, olives and hummus with pita bread.
Love it so much, I could lick off every sauce and bits from the plate.
Common Man Coffee Roasters\' version of Churros.  It was way too doughy with some uncooked dough portions in the middle.  Definitely disappointing.  The piped cream cheese frosting of the carrot cupcake (not featured here) was also really cloying.  Blah.
Much needed coffee on a very hot Saturday afternoon.  Really like the vibe (and the strong AC) of Common Man Coffee Roasters.
Buns and fries are lukewarm, only tomato but no veg in the burger. Not worthy of $28 price tag. 
Can\'t believe the bread is so hard! Hash brown a bit underwhelming. $8 for a small orange juice. There\'s a banner here that says \"Free coffee and donuts for the unemployed\", but guess what, they say it\'s only for decoration. Nice try. 
Organic Egg Benedict!! The stew ox cheek is damn melt-in-your-mouth!! :D
First time trying Egg Ben with ox cheeks. Not too bad. 
Good morning! Checking out new coffee place in SG. Cool concept.
I am known to \'murder\' my eggs. In this case, I \'murdered\' two. Review at DanielFoodDiary.com
Regular flat white fix! At $5.35.. 
When I read the trusted Harry Gover and Five Senses from down under is behind this new joint, I\'ve got to drink a mean cup. And here I am alone on this coffee mecca.
Super cool teapot!
A soft boiled egg in a nest of crispy filo strips. Balls of breaded and fried Feta sit on cumin scented Hummus with slices of Cucumber, ripe Tomatoes, and briny Olives.
Obviously the coffee here isn\'t for the common folks. Love the interior to bits tho! | #coffee #cafe #instaweekend
House baked beans with confit chorizo, two fried organic eggs and wild rocket with artisanal sourdough toast
I call it \"blue mountain bubble\" flat white. Highly aerated milk which is a little overdone.
These organic eggs had the most beautiful yolks, and sat atop ox cheeks on sourdough. Great dish, a little pricey at $24, but generous serving. 
A perfectly flaky croissant stuffed with ham, cheese, and the most perfect bechamel-mustard sauce. This was the kinda dish you just keep shoveling in your mouth cos you can\'t.stop. $16.
Best brunch I had for ages.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodie #foodstagram #foodgasm #foodporn #instafood #burpple #sgfood #sgfoodies #singaporefood #brunch #foodphotography #sgeats #igfood #foodsg #cafehopping #breakfast

Ok, that\'s all.
Grilled. Chicken. Ever! Rubbed with chilli, drizzled with caramelised lemon, served with guac, and dressed with arugula, my life is complete. Ok, that\'s all.
Uncommon (Market Price)- the waitress said that they\'re using beans from costa rica. It was described to have concentrated red grape and blackcurrent flavor, probably describes the acidity. Not really a fan
Provolone and b√©chamel = superb
Grape and blackcurrant flavours with lingering finish

However, the real gem was hidden below the heap of green loveliness. The braised ox cheeks are so lusciously soft and flavorsome that I made a beeline for it upon stumbling on the \'treasure\' beneath the dense \'vegetation\'.\n<br />Top it up with the ever satisfying poached organic eggs with its glorious flowing yolk that is drenched in chive hollandaise sauce.\n<br />Nestle all on the artisanal sourdough for that final flourish.
Also, yoga movement is just a floor away so their brunch is perfect as a well-deserves post yoga treat ^^ (not that I\'ve ever done any yoga üòÖ) The only downsides are that they don\'t take reservations on the weekend and their items are on the pricier end of the scale. I had the common man veggie wonderland ($24) and my Friend enjoyed the fluffy brioche French toast ($18).

Simple, no cream butter cake with orange lemon aftertones. I quite like it actually. To me, a birthday cake need not be too extravagant or over decorated.

Coffee and conversation is a perfect marriage. üîπüîπ\n<br />One of my favorite baristas is a kinda low key low profile kinda guy. He pours a pretty mean cuppa that looks good and taste good.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />CMCR is a busy busy place. Today me and the barista had a long convo.

When he is in the training room, he made it a point to step out and says hello to me. He does not pour very often these days but each time I visit, he willingly and passionately prepares a good cuppa with a beautiful latteart.\n<br />‚óæ\n<br />Thank you for the cuppa and the warmth. Indeed friendships are certainly forged over coffee.
He is always smiling and really made me smile each time I visit. He pours a different art everytime I am there.\n<br />üîº\n<br />I adore this very much and by now he knows my kinda coffee.

Beautified by the jagged sugar piece that resembles a tiara.\n<br />‚óΩ‚ñ´\n<br />Grilled Almond cakes (baked inhouse) with berries and salted caramel ice cream. Garnished with nuts for crunch and drizzling of salted caramel sauce. I had high hopes that it will taste yumz cos it looked tempting.\n<br />‚ñ´‚óΩ\n<br />Personally I find this overly sweet. Perhaps it is more suited for the sweet tooth. Overall, it aint too bad...just that the sugar content could be reduced. It looks positively pretty.

In collab with Yoga Movement which opened on the 2nd level at 22 Martin Road. ‚ñ´\n<br />Grounded by Commonman Coffee occupies an alfresco area outside Yoga Movement studio. Very chio and wonderful natural lighting. At the moment the beverages are served in takeaway cups. ‚óæ\n<br />We had a little snack and it is called espressco cranberry balls. It is crunchy, soft, chewy with a little peanutty buttery flavor and the whole ball is coated with sesame seeds. Quite nice actually. For 2 balls slightly smaller than a golf ball, cost at $5. Other food items such as chia seed pudding are geared towards the health conscious types.\n<br />‚ñ´\n<br />It is a lovely place to relax, chill, read a book etc with very long communal seats and plush cushions for added comfort. This is another place to hideout with great coffee.
I was wowed by the 1st sip. A cup of very aromatic coffee and has very rich taste.\n<br />Location may not be so convenient, but it is crowded on a Sunday at about 5pm. And, they closed at 6pm.\n<br />Definitely a nice place for good coffee. I love the bar look alike concept and their in-house coffee academy! If you\'re there alone, sit along the glass window and have a good read while sipping a good cuppa.
If you need that one cafe that doesn\'t fail you.

Woke up feeling like sweet food this morning and so sweet food it shall be! When your craving\'s as vague as anything sweet, everything sweet will fall on your hit list. Trust me, I know.

Robertson Quay area. One of the must visit caf√© if you consider yourself as a caf√© hopper. It does not disappoint in term of both coffee and food. \n<br />#breakfast #brunch #burpple #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife #cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeeaddict #coffeegram #coffeeholic #coffeelife #coffeelove #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #instacoffee #lunch #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #commonmancoffee #robertsonquay

Too hard and oily :-( the ones at grub was better :-(
After taste was a little more sourish but probably because it\'s double shot. Good coffee nonetheless. 
Bold/Medium flavour, holds its ground, smooth, hits the spot üëå

They have nice bf 
Pancakes were fluffy but more suited as a dessert item than main course. The croque monsieur tasted abit dry tho croissant had distinct layers.
brioche frenchy with a real good scoop of vanilla.

From the get-go, the place resonated a medieval grandeur the moment I stepped in. It felt clean and modern and had the vibe of a downtown hipster bar. Feeling a little bloated from my previous meal, I was contented with just a cuppa iced chox. The beverage was smooth and velvety without being too creamy and sweet. What made it a little more special was the ice cubes in the drink that doesn\'t appear to melt very much over the course of ~30 mins, and this feature helped make the drink non-diluted. I heard that the brekkies might be quite good so I\'ll be back for more, subject to crowd issues. #commonmancoffeeroasters #icedchox #brunch #sgcafe #secretlifeoffatbacks
