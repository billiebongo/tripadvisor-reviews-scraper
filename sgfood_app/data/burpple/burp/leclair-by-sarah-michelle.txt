🍴\n<br />Several canapés and their eclairs in one set that includes 2 coffee/tea! I must say it\'s pretty worth it for $50 per set, judging from the quality of the items! Their eclairs are as good as they usually are. Each eclair is a perfect balance of taste. None of them are too sweet, because there will always be another element to balance it out. Especially for the salted caramel one! It tasted like dulce de leche w a hint of salt 😋😋. Even the savouries were perfectly executed (other than the bruschetta where the bread was too hard), the pies were beautifully done! We definitely walked away w happy bellies. 😆\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #hightea #eclair #leclair

Started my second day at the new office with @deliveroo_sg hohoho. Just HAD to order the eclairs from @leclairpatisserie! These pretty pastries are perfect cause they aren\'t cloyingly sweet and just the right amount of exciting flavours to wake you up during the afternoon slump. Flavours I got: salted caramel, gula Melaka and my favourite: Ispahan - rose and lychee with huge raspberries in the Centre - refreshing bites of fruit and soft, gently sweet pink cream! #eclairs
(Delivered by @Uber_SING #UberEATS; use \'eats-uberbryandmlee\' for $10 off your first order!)
The music, these delicate beauts; it\'s like our very own L\'éclaire de Genie. Ambience aside, their sweet creations are nothing short of fantastic. Tried their newest eclairs as well as the older Ispahan, and all were commendable. The Ispahan was one of my faves: the lychee-rose custard light and delicate, but discernible. Of the newer flavours, the Matcha Azuki and Mango Passionfruit stole my heart. The Lime Basil with Coconut was really interesting, though a tad funky for me (the basil was really really intense). The Jivara makes a lighter option for chocolate fans, and quite lovely with the addition of caramelised apples. All in all, fab.
Gorgeous and tastes damn good! Got the Matcha Azuki, Ispahan, Roasted Pistachio with Strawberries &amp; 66% Mexique Dark Chocolate. Loved how the essence of each flavour was captured wonderfully without being overly sweet nor artificial. Pricey but all\'s good with The Entertainer. Will be back to try the other flavours!😍
The Roasted Pistachio &amp; Strawberries Eclair carries a light pistachio cream with bits of strawberries on top. It has a subtle nuttiness combining the tanginess from the strawberries. 
I went back, hoping to be able to taste the Lemon Meringue eclair but alas... It was not meant to be. Ordered 4 eclairs (from the top): Roasted Pistachio Strawberry, Banana Walnut Crumble, Matcha Azuki and Tahitian Vanilla and Pecan ($30). Good for sharing as each eclair is pretty sizeable! Belly &amp; tastebuds enjoyed the Tahitian Vanilla &amp; Pecan the most. 
The selection: Roasted Pistachios and Strawberries, Ispahan, Matcha Azuki, and 66% Mexique Dark Chocolate.\n<br />Ispahan, which is a type of pink pompom-looking Damask rose, is the acclaimed favourite. The stronger lychee sweetness is complemented by a touch of the floral rose notes, and real raspberries inserted for a tinge of sourness. My main gripe about this is the presence of the sugary fondant. I also liked the dark chocolate eclair, which is sure to win any cacao fan with its rich chocolate glaze and filling and crunchy gold-dusted crumble.\n<br />I bought these for takeaway and only shared them with my friends hours later, so we were expecting them to be soft aka “lao-hong”. They, surprisingly, remained intact from my cutting them up and still had a bit of crusty integrity. Glad that they weren’t as delicate as they looked!
Gorgeous, gorgeous eclaires that look and taste the part! Don\'t let the prices fool you, these at $8 a pop do not disappoint - as premium as it gets! Also had their chocolate which was delightfully chocolatey and definitely worth every cent too!
PS: Let people do what they want, it\'s their instagram account. If you\'re unhappy with what you see, just scroll down? Wouldn\'t hurt you right? #justsaying
But I still wanna post it. L\'éclair by Sarah Michelle. I\'m always very inspired by people who never despise small beginnings. Sarah and Michelle who are chef owners started with pop out event before they have their actual physical store! Very unpretentious pastries. I support!
I have bought 8 eclairs for the price of 4 ytd using grabz app premium membership. Key in HANNAH10 to get the membership at a privileged rate of $10/month (usual: $15.98) &amp; HANNAH85 for $85/year. 😊
Finally made my way down to the éclair specialty store that has been on my wish list for the longest time. The nicely textured choux pastries with their unique cream fillings, adorned with colourful glaze and toppings are just too pretty to be consumed.
This pretty looking eclairs are priced between $7-$8 each but the taste of it is completely worth the bucks you paid for. Treat yourself with some luxury goodies! 
Thankful for friends who would make it happen! Best of all, these eclairs are purchased using #EntertainerApp, hence its three for three 😍 \n<br />Featuring the CNY eclairs:\n<br />- Bak Kwa Pork Floss [$8.50]\n<br />- Pineapple Tart [$8.50]\n<br />- Black Sesame [$8]\n<br /> The other two are Kaya Pandan [$8] and Tahitian Vanilla &amp; Pecans [$8].
Used the #EntertainerApp for a 3-for-3 deal and also got some of our all time favorites like the Kaya Pandan 🤓

Couldn’t resist when I saw that L’eclair had Bak Kwa Pork Floss eclairs. It was truly the only flavour I was after and out of all the flavours we tried, I would still say that it’s the only interesting and worthwhile eclair to indulge in, downside is that it’s only available for a few more days. The other flavours were pretty average, normal flavours that you can commonly find. The Ispahan (Rose) Flavour in pretty pink was more for the eyes, not a fan of the thick icing layer.\n<br />Try out more flavours with the 1-for-1 eclairs deal on Grabz app for premium members.

You can still grab them before it ends on this coming Sunday!
Taking inspiration from traditional CNY food items, @leclairpatisserie introduced 3 CNY Special eclairs:\n<br />- Black Sesame ($8)\n<br />- Pineapple Tart ($8.50)\n<br />- Bak Kwa Pork Floss ($8.50)
Glad that I finally get to try it after missing the last round it\'s launched during our Golden Jubilee weekend. Fragrant kaya cream piped on the choux pastry, adding crunchy coconut biscuits and shredded coconut as a finishing touch. Local kaya spread and eclair, who would had thought that they would go so well together.
A box of 10 of eclairs from L\'eclair by Sarah Michelle. Featuring 3 of their CNY special flavours - Pineapple Tart, Black Sesame, Pork Floss - I found the black sesame to be the best tasting; the other two were interesting but I might not get it again :p  for more normal flavours try the Vanilla or Salted Caramel, and if you like flowery flavours get the Ispahan, one of their best sellers. 
1) Bak Kwa Pork Floss (SGD 8.50) - A genius creation of eclair filled with bak kwa-infused cream and bak kwa bits, garnished with seaweed pork floss. Love the balance of the sweet-savoury taste with bits of bak kwa in it. Our top choice!
We all love the bak kua! \n<br />Pineapple tarts $8.50\n<br />Bak kua pork floss $8.50\n<br />Black sesame $8
.\n<br />1) Pineapple Tart [$8.50]\n<br />2) Black Sesame [$8]\n<br />3) Bak Kwa Pork Floss [$8.50]\n<br />.\n<br />While the thought of bak kwa pork floss eclair sounds intriguing, the well- balanced mix of sweet and savoury cream with occasional bites of bak kwa took us by surprise and turned out to be our top favourite of all.
This time we try all the 3 #ChineseNewYear2016 Eclairs. \n<br />➊ [Roasted Pistachio &amp; Strawberries FREE U.P. S$8] \n<br />➋ [Bak Kwa Pork Floss S$8.50] \n<br />➌ [Black Sesame FREE U.P. S$8] \n<br />➍ [Pineapple Tart S$8.50]
Today I tried the CNY special eclairs: Black Sesame Eclair, Bak Kwa Pork Floss Eclair &amp; Pineapple Tart Eclair. My favourite is the Bak Kwa Pork Floss Eclair! A savory yet yummy eclair! 😄😋
.\n<br />So glad that some good things are here to stay, and this flavour is one of them.
But it\'s twelve days of christmas right? #foodporn #leclairbysarahmichelle #burpple
😍😍 Not to mention very exquisite and unique in their own flavours too! So good ahhh even for someone who usually doesn\'t fancy éclairs hahaha 😂
Six delicious éclairs perfected in pastry, presentation and taste! Personal favourites include salted caramel, ispahan and...can I say all??? Christmas specials end 31st december. #foodporn #leclair #burpple
All these adorable Christmas specials available until 31 December! I especially loved the Blood Orange Chocolate, spiked with grand marnier for a boozy kick that really punched through the rich cocoa glaze and chocolate cream infused with tangy blood orange.
Festive Eclairs - Peppermint Dark Chocolate, Cranberry White Chocolate, Speculoos &amp; Blood Orange Chocolate.
These limited festive flavours are available from 10th December till 31st December, so grab it before they are gone!
Almost too pretty to eat. Usually not a fan of eclairs but these were lovely - both delicate and rich at the same time. Matcha flavour was strong (yay!), and I particularly liked the lemon meringue and mango passionfruit ones. However, they were definitely on the pricey side at $7-8 each. You definitely pay for finesse and quality, but I\'m just glad that the Entertainer app allowed me to get 6 for the price of 3 😅
Former is their top seller that combines light rose cream, raspberries and lychee, decorated with an edible petal that it\'s almost too pretty to be eaten. Whereas the latter which is made of rich Valrhona hazelnut cream and roasted hazelnut resembled a Ferrero Rocher.
Rather late into the scene, this was actually my first time trying such eclairs as the ones that I am familiar with are those not-so-yummy kinds served in buffets. Interestingly, my initial thought was that they tasted rather ordinary and the fact that they are pricey, my expectations were high. Fortunately, the flavours slowly came through and I have to commend on the meticulous skills of the pastry chefs who with their nimble fingers, painstakingly construct each eclair one at a time. My favourites have got to be the Ispahan (with light rose cream, lychees and raspberries) and Lemon Meringue (with lemon cream, Italian meringue and lime zest). Many thanks to @snapandeatsg for giving us a treat with these beautiful eclairs.
Favourites are the ones in the front row - Ispahan, Lemon Meringue and Hazelnut. Pleasing both in the aesthetics and Flavours department. \n<br />Isn\'t the first time having their éclairs (had them during a pop up once) and didn\'t have the chance to visit their cafe since then. These eclairs don\'t come cheap with prices ranging from $7 to $9 each. \n<br />Thanks @snapandeatsg for the sweet treats! (I also haven\'t utilised my entertainer app 😹)
Shown here is 66% Dark Chocolate ($8), one of the permanent selection available. Made of mexique dark chocolate cream, cocoa glaze and cocoa streusel, it\'s great for chocolate lovers. Two other seasonal flavours shown here are Roasted Pistachio &amp; Strawberries ($8) and Earl Grey ($8).
Kaya pandan for me 😋 Review on all flavours up on the web ☺️ blessed Sunday!
Tastes as good as it looks, really. Can\'t wait for their Christmasy eclairs already ❄️⛄️🎅🎄 .\n<br />📝 Check out my reviews on @nomnom.sg and @openricesg if you\'re interested hahaha 🙆\n<br />.\n<br />#nomnomsg #cafeweeksg #leclairpatisserie

Tried another 6 flavors !
These eclairs are really good. However, they are quite pricey. But! If you\'re around the town area and willing to spend give these eclairs a try!
👍🏼 Definitely a sweet treat with the folks. Kaya pandan for me!
My favourite was definitely the Ispahan –  extremely photo-worthy, the éclair magnificently brings about a unique flavour with its light rose cream, lychees, fresh raspberries &amp; an edible rose petal. The rest are remarkable too, but my wallet seems to only will scream for Ispahan on every future visit.\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks so much for the treat! @whychxr 😊
#TGIF By the way, how do you eat an eclair daintily w a fork? (w/o the cream spilling out everywhere) Love the notes of rose and lychee in this! #burpple
Loves the banana cream in the eclair. Tasted so good!! So unforgettable!! 😋😋
When will I see the light at the end of the tunnel? #fbf
Tried the ispahan and earl grey flavours! The Ispahan had a light rose &amp; lychee fragrance which I enjoyed, only qualm is that the icing was a little gummy 
All the essential flavors of kaya pandan are combined in one soft and fragrant creamy kaya filling wrapped in delicate choux pastry, topped with crunchy coconut biscuits and dessicated coconut. The result is just incredibly light flavorful dessert! Get it fast before is taken out from the menu again!
The SG50 long weekend might be over but there is no reason why you should not indulge in French desserts with a local infusion. Inspired by our favourite local breakfast of Kaya Toast is this Kaya Pandan Eclair, which features an open top Eclair with swirled Kaya cream and dessicated coconut and coconut biscuit. The heavy flavours of Pandan and coconut runs through the eclair without being overly sweet; the only gripe is that the coconut biscuit seemed to have lost all its crunch after being displayed at the counter for too long. Choux pastry was of pretty decent quality; with the right amount of moistness and not being sadly dry.
Pandan Kaya Eclair (SGD 8) - So nostalgic. Just like what I spread on my bread for breakfast everyday. The shredded coconut gave it an added crunch.
On my first visit, these pies had already sold out. That only made me want to try it even more. However, I was disappointed as the value of this pie did not match up to its taste. The crust tastes resoundingly similar to the chicken pie from Prima Deli, with the sweet flavour and crumbly texture. The chicken and bacon filling portions were given sparingly. 
..\n<br />It\'s true that desserts will make an unhappy man happy but that may not always be the case. There will times when we find ourselves facing the wall &amp; got no idea how we are going to continue move forward. Always remember that, tough times don\'t last but tough men do!💪🏻 I am pretty sure the rainbow🌈 will show up just right at the corner.😌 Been a long day!\n<br />..\n<br />..\n<br />📷: @karlnch \n<br />Hashtag sgfoodiary to share your love with our foodie community and get a chance to be featured!\n<br />..\n<br />..
\"That\'s the sad thing about Hazelnut; you can\'t get away without being compared to Ferrero Rocher or Kinder Bueno,\" says Anna.
The Ispahan -  a combination of Rose, Lychee, Raspberry - looked really pretty, with the flavours coming out subtly. I particularly enjoyed the rose cream. Only issue with the eclairs here is that its pretty pricey :/ but I guess the quality and the classy layout shows in the price tag.
The result is a delightful temptation, creating sublime bursts of flavor in every mouthful.
Sweet Saturday. Out to meet my girlies for dinz and then we have a date with Mike.
It was the last day that they were available and they were so good! Keeping my fingers crossed that L\'éclair might add this flavour onto the menu permanently!
at first glance, they were irresistible and I couldn\'t make up my mind on the flavours because they were all equally appealing and fighting for my attention. so in the end, we ordered 7 out of 9 flavours!\n<br /> if I really gotta choose, my favourite is the Ispahan ($8.50) which is made up of lychee, rose and raspberry with a pretty rose petal. love the hint of lychee rose flavour which were creamy with slight crispiness of the éclair shell. \n<br />the only comment I have is, the fruits were all too sour to my liking. but I suppose they may be a good match to the sweet side of them?
Worth the burn in the wallet. One of the best eclairs ive tasted. 😉👍
One of the stops we made on our food trail yesterday – finally got to savour these photogenic beauties! At an average of $8 apiece, I must say they\'re quite pricey; each bite works out to $2! That said, I do think every one we had was very well-balanced in flavour and I was hard-pressed to pick a favourite between the Ispahan, Lemon Meringue and Kaya.
Not really a fan of eclairs but I like this! The kaya cream was fragrant with strong aroma of screw pine &amp; coconut.
Initially a pop-up concept, L’eclair has now opened a shopfront at Singapore Shopping Centre, serving their delicately crafted and gorgeous eclairs. With flavours ranging from Vanilla and Pecan to Matcha, you will have a difficult time deciding which to pick. We say go for the Lemon Meringue ($7.50) — filled with a tart lemon curd and topped with marshmallow-like meringue — or the stunningly beautiful Ispahan ($8.50). For something savoury, go for the flaky home-baked Chicken &amp; Bacon Pie ($12).
The choux was a tad dense and bready, not bad though not my fave. The creme fillings however were so good. The earl grey creme patisserie was especially fragrant and bursting with floral accents. I wasn\'t a fan of the Pistachio, whose tart strawberry garnish clawed with the white chocolate pistachio creme. Sarah says they\'re still working on that, so I\'m looking forward to trying the final product!
If you\'re craving for something sweet yet filling, this chicken mushroom pie would hit all the right notes with its savory fillings and sweet crust!
Maximum 10 different flavors of freshly made eclairs will be served each day with 4 classic flavors such as Vanilla &amp; Pecans, Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate and Ispahan. You\'ll have a hard time choosing from these visually appealing and instagram worthy eclairs! Choux pastries are light and filled with ideally balanced filling that is both decadent and delicious, creating sublime bursts of flavor in every mouthful. Definitely will be back looking for more flavors to try and return for a few favorites!
Thank you @cyndilee for bringing us to your cousin\'s cafe.
Having operated around as a pop-up concept, L\'Eclair has finally opened their cafe at the fringe of Somerset at 190 Clemenceau Ave. The Lemon Meringue Eclair maintains as my favourite out of the two; well filled with lemon curd in the inside, the tart filling was mediated with the slightly sweet marshmallow-like meringue sitting atop, and the Choux pastry isn\'t too limp nor dry. Matcha came with the heavy infusion of White Chocolate flavours over the top, but the matcha cream was thick though for a matcha lover I would have expected more bitterness of the aroma of matcha. Still I guess I would be back some day to try more flavours; most of the Eclairs look pretty interesting to try!
Home baked by Le Cordon Bleu, Paris pastry chef graduate. The melt-in-your-mouth crumbly pie holds the chicken and bacon filling so well, served with a generous side of cranberry leafy salad. 
Looking forward to weekends!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#eclair #dessert #foodsg #sgfood #instasg #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #travel #instatravel #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats

{Assorted Eclairs}\n<br />•\n<br />Our favorites were the rose and dark choc flavours! The matcha one can be missed 😛 but these are almost as good as L’Éclair de Genie from Paris 😍\n<br />•\n<br />📍Dhoby Ghaut

One is satisfying enough for me
The dark red petal was too pretty for me to resist. Look at the layers of lychee chantilly cream sitting so snugly between the rose-coated top and soft pastry bed. Raspberries were inserted between the cream, adding a refreshing tint of zest to the luscious, feminine flavours of this pink pastry - every bite was filled with the beautifully-orchestrated flavours of rose, lychee and raspberry. Needless to say, I was glad I chose this.
The pastry puff itself was soft, carrying the weight of pistachio cream and bits as well as strawberries on top of it, giving it a very lovely combination of nutty sweetness, tart and crunch. The cream within was delicate and smooth, making for a\n<br />fabulous choice.
And all thanks to @the_entertainer241 we get to share these 6 delicious èclairs for the price of 3😋\n<br />Thank you V Jie for the treat 😍😘
Gathering is made so much sweeter!

That rose and lychee eclair, especially 🎀 #eclairs #sweettooth #vscofood #sgfood #sgcafehopping #burpple
.\n<br />Personal favourite would be the Cranberry White Chocolate and Speculoos eclairs.
Christmas with eclair. Rose smell is always the best because flower can bring me a happiness. Limited edition for christmas was another special eclair to catch

Great for a lovely afternoon tea. 😀
Why? Because we have Entertainer\'s 1-for-1 woohoo!!
It all begins with the choux, and so far, this is the best example of a perfectly executed choux pastry. Just a slight crust on the outside, a savoury and buttery pillowy texture that soothes rather than resist.

Though I like the earl grey best, first impression counts so I only took a photo of this; nobody makes better Ispahan than Pierre Herme, period\n<br />#vscocam#vscosg#vscofood#food52#foodporn#sgfood#sgcafe#sgeats#burpple#8dayseat#eclair#ispahan

The lychee cream and filling is just right, not too overpowering and the refreshing fruit comes out just bursting with joy. Despite my reservations, the eclair are quite terrific :)\n<br />#eclairs #lychee #leclairsg #sarahmichelle #sgbaker #sgcafe #sgfood #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #patisserie
It\'s a mixture of lychee, rose and berries cream!

Heh, already planning my visit back just for their chicken and bacon pie 😍😍 #burpple #leclairpatisserie #leclairsg #eclair #lemonmeringue
Lemon Meringue 》$7.50\n<br />Kaya Pandan 》$8
Puff was alittle crispy. Harmonizes very well with the cream and balanced off with the tangy berries😋😋 #berries #eclairs #dessertlovers #dessert #cafehopping #cafesg #sgblogger #burpple #openricesg #tfjsg50 @hungrygowhere @leclairpatisserie @jellylovesfood
abit underwhelming for eclairs @ $7.50 per pop. gotta give it to them for the interesting flavors though! and so instagram worthy ^^ here we tried their famous ispahan eclair and a classic dark choc eclair. 
My favourite is the ispahan and lemon meringue. Pricey but really worth it. 
😍😍 #burpple #leclairpatisserie
