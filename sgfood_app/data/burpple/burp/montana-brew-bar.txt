Unanimous favourite of the day. Felt that this rendition of their Signature Mac&amp;Cheese Waffle was even better than the last - same ol‚Äô truffle-infused, pretty mild flavours of jalapeno, mac&amp;cheese stuffed within the batter which was surprisingly light without the mushiness from before, mozzarella; but much cheesier. Do eat it while it‚Äôs hot and you might get a biiiiiiiit of a cheesepull.
Will never say no to wingsüôÉ These fried chicken wings with garlic mirin sauce ($12) was savoury with a tinge of sweetness, remained crisp (despite our photo-taking) while juicy inside.
Reminded us a whole lot of Taiwan night markets‚Äô fried sweet potato sticks with prune powder! We thought a tad more Masala seasoning in the tossing of these crisp fries would work better.
Got to say we liked this appetiser more than the other we had! Lightly battered fried whitebait tossed in five spice seasoning - it was a mix of sweet, sour and spice. A little pricey though!
Thick huge slab of southern fried chicken patty with coleslaw and a side of corn salsa. Pretty nice rub on the chicken skin and waffle was crisp, but we thought it would be better if there was some sort of sauce to bring the dish together. Also heard it‚Äôs one of the more popular waffle choices here!
The crowd favourite during our lunch at Montana was this Signature Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle from their new menu. We‚Äôve had their original Mac &amp; Cheese waffle in the past but this rendition outshone the first. Similar ingredients go into this - Jalapeno, truffle oil, Mac &amp; Cheese and mozzarella, but I liked how the cheese flavours here were a lot stronger and if you dig into it hot, you‚Äôll get that nice gooey stretchy cheese on top. Prices here are mostly on the pricier end!
Spent our Sunday late lunch digging into this table of Asian inspired new brunch items - think Whitebait with Fivespice Seasoning ($11), Fried Chicken Wings with Garlic Mirin Sauce ($12), Sweet Potato Fries with Masala Seasoning ($11). Got to say we digged the newest rendition of their Signature Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle ($15) most, have it hot and you‚Äôd get that gooey stretchy cheese atop a crisp waffle, a lot stronger in the cheese flavours compared to their original. 
What every weekend should look like! An afternoon well spent, with Montana\'s new Asian-inspired brunch menu. Start with interesting sides such as sweet potato fries with masala seasoning, whitebait with fivespice seasoning, fried chicken with garlic mirin. Followed by satisfying comfort food of baked salmon with poached eggs which comes with yuzu hollandaise, old classic southern fried chicken waffles, but my (all-time) favourite is still the improved version of the mac&amp;cheese waffles! 
With combination of classic breakfast ingredients like potatoes and eggs, the Truffle Eggs Rosti can\'t go quite wrong. The crispy golden brown rosti had a good crunch with those charred edges which was well complemented by the runny egg yolk, but I struggled to see how the Parma ham added colours to this dish. The truffle in the hollandaise sauce was towards the faint side, which didn\'t overwhelm the entire dish with its flavor!
This gorgeous dessert newly launched at Montana Singapore wowed all of us. Better still, it\'s fine dining plating at cafe price.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />We liked the taste too. It consists of smoked chocolate mousse, macerated berries and chocolate brownies, topped with vanilla ice cream. Irish whiskey and berry sauce is provided separately for you to pour over, and that classy web around is is spun sugar.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I think this dessert could become their newest hype after their successful freak cakes. Taken during a tasting.

Not bad. \n<br />This is basically a dessert place. Ambiance is good, waffle is nice, Rossi is appetizing, but don\'t expect much on the steak. \n<br />If u need something to fill ur stomach, go for waffle, wings and rosso, u won\'t be disappointed.\n<br />Nice place to gather and chit chat.

Waffle itself is fluffy and crisy. Has that hlack sesame flavor to it, the sesame ice cream is dissapointing, lacks flavor and a bit rough, texture-wise 4/5
One of the reasons why i came back to montana is their waffles. This one was not served hot but still has crispiness and fluffiness to it. Served with chunks of crab meat, the sauce was addicting though too little amount.
There is this distictiveness about this coffee which i think is the coconut. Gula malaka flavor is strong, but these two elements overcome the coffee
Pasta was slightly dry but really good lunch deal for only $12++! You can top up $2 for a good cup of latte too. 
Love the simplicity of this dish. A good choice for lunch! You can also choose to top up coffee for your set lunch. (7.5/10)
The red velvet waffles are crispy while retaining its fluffiness. They have a distinct  red velvet taste that pairs well with the strawberry cheesecake ice cream &amp; cream cheese sauce. Unlike most places that give only 1 scoop, I appreciate the two big scoops of ice cream that allow for generous servings of cold creamy ice cream with warm crispy waffle\n<br />üìç@montanasingapore, Pomo Mall #02-25, 1 Selegie Rd, S188306 (near Dhoby Ghuat Mrt)
Mac and Cheese Waffles-good lord, this waffle has a very unexpected taste. I was expecting that overpowering mac and cheese, it was more subtle in a good way. Youll taste it just right, though some might dislike the lack of cheese\n<br />4.5/5
Red velvet waffle-im someone who fell for red velvets hehe. Has a fruity taste, crisp and since its shape is that of a circulae waffle, made me wonder where the last quarter is 4.5/5
Big pieces of crab meat with well textured pasta. I love how there are some crab brooth at the bottom that adds flavour to the aglio olio. Slightly overpriced for the portion but the taste is great. I came here because there\'s the 1-FOR-1 deal, or else I would not pay $20.80++ for such a small portion.
Braised Beef Cheek with Carrot Kimchi ($20.80+)
Big Breakfast ($18.00+)
Maybe it was my high expectations but the cake came out very normal. While it had a fluffy vanilla sponge interior, it was nothing beyond a typical sponge cake. A huge let down was that it was extremely sweet. My group hardly tasted any cookie butter flavour beyond the overload of caramel sugariness\n<br />üìç@montanasingapore, Pomo Mall #02-25, 1 Selegie Rd, S188306 (near Dhoby Ghuat Mrt)
Coconut Cold Brew ($6.80+)
Next time I will go for their sweet waffles instead!! Just a personal preference thing.
This was simple but so good! Could taste the miso in it. Fab on its own but mixing the sous vide egg into it just made the sauce that bit richer! Hidden gem in the menu!
Black velvet waffles with green tea ice cream ($14.90). There\'s an option to choose soft or crisp waffles. Chose the latter and waffle was indeed crisp on the outside and moist inside. You can also choose either green tea or black sesame ice cream. The green tea taste was more on the milky side but still tasted good overall.
I still fondly remember the times when Montana Brew Bar used to sell pretty affordable and decent fare like their matcha strawberry waffles. In the past year or so they have revamped themselves and their concept and their offerings are now considerably more expensive than before
Ordered the crispy waffle but it wasn\'t as crispy as I thought it would be. But overall, pretty decent.
not a fan of quinoa but am a sucker for foie gras, so I ended up ordering this dish despite it being paired with quinoa. Well, it didn\'t disappoint!
Tried this aglio olio with crab meat and I\'m filled with approval over their generous chunky crab meat. I also liked it that the pasta was al dente and filled with garlic flavour. Pretty value for money in my opinion given that the ingredients isn\'t stingy at all. 
Always there for their red velvet waffle and coffee but this fried chicken waffle is pretty legit as well. Be sure to try the V60 Cacao which is a blend of heated coconut water &amp; cacao.
Waffles that are crispy on the outside but are made from mac and cheese on the inside. Would prefer it if they were denser and had more mac and cheese taste but this was rather good too!
Seafoody goodness in a densely packed patty with fresh crab meat &amp; prawns. Loved the crispy cajun fries that came pipping hot!
Crab meat aglio olio pasta - for a seafood lover, this was the best pastas I\'ve ever devoured! Good portion for someone hungry. Nice, chill and serene place for a Friday night with the ones I love. @ Second floor of Pomo!
Finally! Tried their famous red velvet waffles! \n<br />Crispy, fluffy and thick waffles with yummy strawberry shortcake ice cream stacked in between. The waffles are in such a pretty red colour that makes you happy when you see them. Now I know why its their famous waffles. I went to waffles heaven and came back! The next time I\'m there, I\'m gonna try their savoury waffles! $14.50 for a serving like this.
$6.80) and Gula Melaka (Coconut cold brew with gula melaka. Lush notes of caramel, toasted nuts. $6.80) versions. Not only interesting but good as well. If you like it a little sweeter, go for the Gula Melaka one. Regular one is very subtle in sweetness with a hint of coconut as the round ice cube is actually coconut water. #tingzieeats #burpple
-\n<br />The beef cheeks are not overly done, fork tender yet retaining some bite to it. The unassuming star is the carrot kimchi that helps cut through the rich sauce with a little kick of spice and sourness.\n<br />-\n<br />Time to get your brunch on!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #montanabrewbar
It\'s like warm hugs hidden in a fried ball.\n<br />-\n<br />Fuzzy and comforting.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #montanabrewbar
Fried Mac &amp; Cheese! Mac &amp; Cheese Fritters ($8) from @montanasingapore are highly addictive! These tasty bite size goodness are packed with creamy Mac &amp; Cheese waiting to be unleashed in to your mouth! Goes hand it hand with their delicious salsa dip! Yummy! üòã
With meltingly-tender fall-off-the-bone chicken confit spiced up with five-spice dry rub to brine things up, I found delightful pleasure in savouring the skin sweetened up with natural fats atop the juicy succulent meat. It was a unanimous agreement that this was the star of the dish that stood out, but also didn\'t fail to compliment harmoniously well with the chive waffle beneath. Served alongside with smoked ginger plum &amp; coleslaw that acted as light and fresh contrast to the overall, it\'s ultimately a dish that we couldn\'t stop wanting more.
This time having their Peking Chicken Confit with Waffle ($16.50). Five spice chicken confit, chive waffles, smoked ginger plum coleslaw and ginger plum sauce. To us this was a miss, it was tasty but dry in overall. But try their bulgogi beef waffles or assam crab waffles when you\'re there! üòã
Review from my experience at @montanasingapore is up on the blog!
Essentially a veggie burger possessing the depth of smokiness with all the \"meaty\" goodness except that this time, there\'re no saturated fats from any meat. Ultimately a massive portobello creation that makes no apologies &amp; serves to please both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Also, I\'ve always love all the vibes from their interior space. If you\'ve been here I bet you\'ll also agree with me that it\'s really such a perfect spot for casual get-togethers. Don\'t you think?
As good as it looks &amp; sounds, this combination seriously goes so well together it\'s as if we were eating our regular local breakfast &amp; dessert (think kaya, toast, coffee &amp; chendol!) off a stunning birthday cake üíï\n<br />Slathered on with coconut white chocolate glaze &amp; beautifully finished off with brightly coloured old school favourite gem biscuits, coconut shavings &amp; gula melaka crumbs, the slight occasional crunch has unintentionally made this an amazing cake-appreciating session üéÇ\n<br />Definitely passed off as one of the true blue Singapore dessert with a modern twist, &amp; I\'ll recommend this to any of my foreign friends next time they come for a visit. Remind me yes?\n<br />#Blancheeze
favourite things in life; burger, coffee and coconut water. at @montanasingapore, they mash-up the 2 liquids with chilled coffee in funnel over a coconut frozen sphere. game changer and refreshing af. #burpple
First experience at Montana Singapore, actually really surprised. The linguine was Al Dente, perfect texture and the sauce was minimal but tasteful enough. The mushrooms were absolutely delicious, and I have to say, this brown butter miso linguine is a hidden gem in the menu! Loved itüòÅ
üëåüèø i miss my carefree cafe hopping days ‚òπÔ∏è. Also, WHY DO I KEEP GETTING LOGGED OUT OF INSTAGRAM?!
Talking about that, we enjoyed a wide array of excellent dishes like their Crab Aglio Olio ($20.80), Harissa Portobello Mushroom Burger ($16.50), Peking Chicken Confit w/ Waffles ($15.80) &amp; Braised Beef Cheek w/ Carrot Kimchi ($20.80).\n<br />Always very excited every time they come up with new menu. Unlike some other restaurants that try to be interestingly innovative, this is one that never forget that food still need to taste good with a great visual appeal at the same time. Individual reviews to be up soon. TGIF y\'all! üôÜüèª
The waffles still stay as good over at @montanasingapore but I would really have liked a duck confit instead! üò©review up on explodingbelly.com SOON.
Could not resist ordering one for it\'s delectable #OTT appearance. We had the mini Matcha Black Sesame ($14.80) that came topped with matcha kitkat, pocky sticks, Oreo cookies (&amp; soil!) and smores. I loved the luscious black sesame glaze that was artfully drizzled over the cake and the mousse-like matcha buttercream. However, the matcha sponge inside was unfortunately too dense and rather unpalatable to finish. #burpple #dessert #cafehopping #BurppleXChope
Big Breakfast, $18+. Was excited to try their Salmon egg bens but sadly it wasn\'t available :-( Their big breakfast set tasted really normal and meh :-(
Loved the aglio olio, with the right amounts of heat and garlic, generous amounts of crab meat too!
Was pretty decent though it gets a bit Sian after some time. Id prefer if the cake wasn\'t so dense but that\'s just my personal preference! #burpplexchope
Dusted with coconut \"snow\" and embellished with Frosty the Snowman macaroon, this cake definitely brings the Christmas magical feeling to the table. Beneath the white cherry buttercream is a slightly dense black chocolate cake that is drenched in cherry brandy liqueur before hand. There are also generous chunks of sweet cherries in between the layer of the cake, which I found quite addictive (coming from someone who dislikes cherry!)\n<br />*\n<br />Though, it\'s baked daily, do pre-order this cake to avoid any disappointment, especially with Christmas just around the corner!\n<br />A bigger version of 1.5kg is also available for $95. Shoot them an email at info@montana.com.sg 3 days in advance.\n<br />*\n<br />Big thanks to @chinesewinegal and @montanasingapore for hosting us!\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #dessert #food #cake #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeatsg

With Santa coming round the corner, all the Christmas themed desserts are starting to make their appearance woop! üéÖüèªüéä Montana\'s gorgeously decorated version has layers of black chocolate sponge layered with cherry sauce made with cherry brandy liquer, covered in cherry buttercream, dark chocolate glaze and coconut shavings all around. 
[New Festive Cake] Karina and Ying did it! You could see how gorgeous this cake is, but I\'m also loving the taste of this.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />It\'s a black forest cake covered in cherry buttercream frosting. The sponge was soaked in a mix of cherry brandy liqueur and cherry. It\'s delicate but sophisticated, and.. it\'s not too sweet! Adults like me would love this, and yet it\'s suitable for the younger crowd too with only a subtle hint of brandy in that uber moist sponge center.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This isn\'t only another pretty cake. It\'s a gorgeous cake that suits my palate too. Thanks Karina and Ying for taking in all our feedback and making this wonderful!
A sous vide free range egg sat atop of tossed linguine in creamy and rich miso brown butter sauce. Really liked the addition of the yolk, be sure to mix it in throughly for an even coating. I enjoyed the blooming earthy flavours from the shiitake and shimeji mushrooms, balanced out by the slices of sweet tangy cherry tomatoes. Was an easy dish to finish!
Food was average, especially the burger. The fries was quite tasteless. Given that the reviews were quite good, i felt that this was over-rated\n<br />Service wasnt that good, needed to remind them a few times\n<br />The nutella cake was instaworthy but taste was average so doesnt really justify the price
Wish I could have this rite now; cold brew with coconut ice ball üå¥üå¥üå¥‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è
Finally tried this! The best part of this dish was the generous chunks for fibrous crab meat. But I\'m sure they\'ve toned down the white habanero cos\' mine wasn\'t very spicy... More please! I like the texture rendered by the panko crumbs, but that also made the pasta more dry. This would be so perfect if it\'s more oily and spicy.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is an invited tasting.
I\'m tempted to say that Montana has the best waffles. They are fluffy but aren\'t limp, because the outer layer has a thin layer of crisp. The eggy fragrance is thus enhanced by the crisp smokiness, while retaining bite in the inner layers without feeling airy. Its good!\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The chicken, when well-fried, were very hot and crispy. It goes really well with the waffles, because it\'s like a mega fried chicken sandwich (think Zinger Burger), except that the buns were those awesome waffles I just mentioned.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.

Don\'t worry about cream being too gerlat, as it\'s quite light. The sesame does bring, in addition fragrant into the dish, however, it seems to have overpowered the matcha flavour, as I could hard taste any matcha in it. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, matcha lovers may not want to get your hopes too high on this. But for the sweet tooth lovers... enjoy.
One thing I have to say about the waffles is that they are unbelievably good! I stopped talking mid-conversation when I had my first bite because I could not believe how amazing it tasted. My friend and I would highly recommend the southern fried chicken waffle and red velvet triple stacked waffle! Don\'t be afraid to explore the savoury waffle sections of the menu, trust me, you will be giving your tastebuds a wonderful experience
No tongue in cheek here when I say these beef cheeks are sublimely soft and savoury. I normally wouldn\'t pair soft and soft together, but that sweet potato/potato mash was silky smooth and cradled the beef cheek sauce beautifully. And that free range poached egg. Oh my.
Panko crumb specked linguine topped with sizeable chunks of crab meat and a smattering of cherry tomatoes. For those who like to feel the burn and the promise of an infernal morning after, request for the addition of their fiery homegrown white habanero.Only a tiny fraction is blended and added to the pasta, but the heat levels are through the roof! The pasta needs a liberal douse of olive oil though.
This coconut cold brew from @montanasingapore might do the trick. Cold brewed with coconut water, and served with a splash of gula melaka and a coconut water ice ball. Smooth coffee with a gentle hint of coconut flavor, a very pleasant and interesting drink I must say! #burpple #montanasg
am gonna get as scientific (but biased) as this conical lab flask.\n<br />.\n<br />fact: coconut water is scientifically proven to keep your body hydrated. and proper hydration has actually been proven to help with weight loss. fact: ingesting caffeine jumpstarts the process of lipolysis, boosting metabolism¬†slightly and helps burn fat.\n<br />.\n<br />fact also: this overnight coffee in coconut water is very nice. is smooth, not shocking rude, you get the sweet salty notes (in a good way) of the refreshing coconut water but still reminded that this is after all a coffee with the very mellowed acidity of coffee. drink direct from the flask or for more experiments, pour onto the coconut sphere by the side.\n<br />.\n<br />a @burpple invite, hosted by @chinesewinegal, art direction @cassakating and venue @montanasingapore - probably the only place in the world to specialise in coconut cold brew drinks.\n<br />.\n<br />.
SPOILT FOR CHOICE. that was what came into my mind as I studied the revamped menu today. And disclaimer: this isn\'t even my first time there. In the end, after wishing I was a cow (for their 4 stomachs) I decided on the Assam crab waffle. I was hoping for the tangy yet spicy dish I love so much and having read many raving reviews about it, my expectations were high. The waffle was large and crab pieces were chunky and fresh but the dish in general was slightly... underwhelming? The waffle had a yellow hue to it but there was no distinct taste and the sauce provided was not spicy too. Quite disappointing as I love my food spicy. Still, the pig in me had to ask for extra sauce and finished everything anyway. Also, I had the fries which were on point. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the insideüëçüèº. The Friend had the burger but only ate half because she was on the \"carb free\" diet. Pig in me was secretly happy and ate the tender fried chicken üòç. Pig in me will continue to go back to try the other items, especially their other burgers and sweet waffles.
Completed one hurdle for this week and just one more till the weekends. üç¥\n<br />If only I can have a black sesame waffle w matcha ice cream to celebrate.. Super moist almost cake like inside with a crisp exterior. Topped with toasted sesame and oats and black sesame sauce! üòã I would prefer the matcha ice cream to have a stronger flavour to complement the bold flavours of the waffle. But this it as good as it gets! üç¥\n<br />Thank you @burpple for the invite and @montanasingapore &amp; @chinesewinegal for hosting!! üç¥\n<br />#burpple #waffle #dessert #blacksesame #matcha
So have a lovely morning while enjoying a glass of coconut cold brew from Montana Singapore. Using coconut water instead, the cold brew are more refreshing with a tinge of sweetness in it 
Revamped menu found at Montana, combining what was in South Bronx into one menu and transforming the original space to Anarchy Bar. No more donuts too but fret not as Montana still retain their specialty: Mac &amp; Cheese waffles.

Tender braised beef with mash sweet potato and carrot kimchi on some toast. It almost feels like a deconstructed bibimbap! The chicken confit is unlike any other confit, where it is sous vide first before confit-ing, to ensure that the chicken does not dry out and retains its tenderness. I also like how they chose to use leaner beef cuts from a mixture of Australian grass fed beef and US corn fed beef to bring out the flavour of the beef in their beef batter! (Can almost say it\'s healthier but stronger in flavour!) The Montana Bangers &amp; Mash comes with a century egg potato foam, which was very light in texture and very unexpected. It is best to dip the toast into it and combine with some chorizo or Italian sausage! ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Äüç¥\n<br />Thanks to @burpple for the invite and @montanasingapore &amp; @chinesewinegal  for hosting us!!‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä üç¥üç¥\n<br />#montana #burpple #sundaybrunch #sgcafe #coldbrew #waffles #fusionfood #burger

Combining two classic Japanese flavours together, this¬†fluffy matcha sponge, completed with Matcha buttercream, black sesame frosting, and black sesame white chocolate ganache¬†is from Montana‚Äôs newest dessert range - Freak Cakes (of 5 distinct and exciting flavours).
Sous vide and confit\'ed to lock in all its juices, the chicken quarter was gratifyingly tender and lip smackingly moist, its skin coated with a fragrant five spice rub that it owes its oriental moniker to.
Dip in &amp; allow your whole meal slices soak up all that beef jus &amp; sink your teeth into those soft cheeks. \n<br />Much love to @ksherena for asking us along! üíï
With an updated brunch menu and newly renovated space, Montana Singapore is always bringing something new to the table - offering different dining experiences. Hence, with the unveiling of Anarchy, a wine bar located at the lower floor (formerly occupied by South Bronx), you can get to understand more about wine, as well as perhaps your palate and how it reflects your personality in the cosy yet intimate space they have created.
Essentially a sponge cake with instagram-worthy toppings and colours. The Matcha Black Sesame came with green tea sponge cake, which I found was rather dense, and glazed with matcha cream and black sesame \"sauce.\" I would have preferred a stronger black sesame flavour to balance the sweet matcha taste. Do share the calories with your friends!
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Why did the panko-garnished Crab Aglio Olio Linguine claim the numero uno position on my list from among the dishes we had?\n<br />Simple. It contained chunks of crab meat which I adore, and its spiciness didn\'t come from the usual suspects.\n<br />Instead, an organically-grown-in-their-own-garden White Habanero was responsible for the appetising kick. Which also accounted for the subtle fragrance. By the way, only a tenth of this tiny bullet of a chilli was used in a serving of pasta but that\'s enough to make me keep a glass of water close by even as I continued to suck up those habanero-heated strands.\n<br />Speaking of the pasta, I wouldn\'t mind if they were a little more oiled up actually. I reckon they would be even tastier (yes, I have a thing for olive oil!) 
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />With its rather OTT aesthetic, we had expected this \"Freak Cake\" ($14.80++) to be a one-dimensional sugar overload. However, we were happy to be proven wrong as the coffee sponge, housemade kaya butter frosting and coconut white chocolate drizzle came together in a decidedly well calibrated combination.\n<br />Size-wise, it isn\'t as big as it looks in Instagram posts.\n<br />Measuring 7 and a half cm across and 8 and a half cm tall (not counting the decorative goodies), it is an ideal serving for either one dessert-lover to indulge in, two lovebirds to share, or four friends on a diet to split üòÅ\n<br />Each \"Freak Cake\" is assembled only to order to ensure the sponge cake stays light, moist and fluffy, and all the toppings taste as fresh as possible. Such attention to detail is something I appreciate.\n<br />Thank you @montanasingapore for hosting us today.
Ending the meal on a sweet note‚Ä¶ that is in actual fact not that sweet, but rather a good balance of flavours.\n<br />Can\'t go wrong with feeding me coffee in any form. The slightly heavier texture sponge of this cake is made with coffee with aromatic kaya buttercream between the layers and covering the entire cake. Drizzles of coconut white chocolate create an eye catching display.\n<br />Eat the cake with the coconut and Gula Melaka crumbs on the plating for a little added texture!\n<br />My favourite part has to be the ice gems reminding me of toddler days where I used to bite off the icing and force everyone else to eat the biscuits for me. \n<br />#MontanaSG #FreakCakes
The last time I went to Montana was in a past life when they still served nothing but waffles and coffee, so I was glad to see it evolve into a completely new and much sexier beast.
I initially wanted to compare Montana\'s crab burger from their new menu to the ludicrously lovely crab burger at Artistry (yes, I have been forever spoiled in the best of ways by that crab burger), but I found out that it would be akin to me comparing a watermelon to an orange.
Portion for one (3-4\" Diameter and height), Freak Cakes comes in 6 flavours - think Matcha Black Sesame, Red Velvet Cream Cheese or the Caramel Cookie Butter (pictured). Enjoyed the salty sweet flavours from this one, the saltiness made it less jetlat. Though portion for one, I still recommend sharing the calories üòù
Their new menu introduces several interesting items such as Braised Beef Cheek with Carrot Kimchi and Peking Chicken Confit with Waffle. Kudos to them for the constant innovation and endless creativity; always enjoyed trying the interesting combination of flavours. My personal favourite was the Crab Aglio Olio Linguine with a surprisingly strong kick. Do ask for the special white habanero chilli if you feel you\'re up for a spicier dish!
The only thing I tried in this bowl is the beef. This is so tender melting soft that your teeth isn\'t needed to masticate the meat, the focus is in using solely your tongue to taste the flavorful beef that\'s braised to perfection. My friend felt that the carrot kimchi was a miss as it tasted odd on his tongue. The egg was runny and blended well with the beef. Not much was said about the lump of orange which I couldn\'t quite remember what it is. Would recommend this for the BEEF. #beefislife
The chicken is sooooooooo tender, really really nice but it\'s a bit lacking in terms of its taste. This problem, however, is solved with the yuzu sauce that came along with it. The waffle is surprising really good. The savory waffle is fragrant on its own, hitting all the right notes.
Really strong matcha taste with a hint of sesame (the black sauce, if you\'re thinking that it\'s chocolate. Was wishing the cake sponge could be softer but it\'s not too bad.
Standing out would be the Braised Beef Cheek with Carrot Kimchi ($20.80) - loved the Ah Ma Liu and her dentures approved tender beef cheek and sweet potato mash. \n<br />What\'s a trip to Montana with having their airy waffles? The Peking Chicken Confit ($16.50) were souv vide then confit-ed (is there such a word) to ensure the softness of the chicken with a perfect skin. \n<br />Thank you @chinesewinegirl and @montanasingapore for the warm hospitality! And @ksherena for the invite üòò
With limited quantities on a daily basis, these Freak Cakes ($14.80) are the perfect treat to end your meal with! Whether you\'re a sweet tooth or not, this can be easily shared between 1-4 pax! We got ourselves the Caramel Cookie Butter, which consisted of Vanilla Sponge, insanely good Cookie Butter Buttercream &amp; the perfectly salted Salted Caramel which blends all the components together so well. \n<br />Much love to @ksherena for letting me tag along &amp; @chinesewinegal for indulging us with all the goodies!
As the kaya frosting was too sweet for me, the bitter sponge cake neutralized the overall sweetness and made this combi perfect.

This may look and sound like any usual aglio olio around, but it was one dish I really liked from Montana\'s new menu! The balance of garlicky flavours and kick of spice was done just right, unlike many that I\'ve to request for more chili. Seafood lovers would also really appreciate the generous chunks of crab meat all over.
I really liked the crab and seafood patty! If you like their Assam crab waffle, get this! üëç For girls who hate carbs, try their thick cut fries, you\'ll be addicted and you can say goodbye to your lame low carb diet plan that doesn\'t work! üòÇ
Served with potato and sweet potato mash, poached egg and toast. Perfect to be eaten any time of the day. The sous vide beef is very tender. The carrot kimchi gave slight spiciness and tanginess to cut through the heaviness of the beef. Most of so called fusion food doesn\'t work but this one does. üêÑüêÑüêÑ\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @MontanaSingapore for having us.
Most probably a game changer for non-coffee drinkers like myself, Montana‚Äôs range of¬†Coconut Cold Brew menu serves to cater to the different palate types. By using coconut water to sweeten the cold brew, the result was a smooth and milder tasting coffee.
.
I don\'t eat beef but here\'s what in one of the top selling dishes from Montana\'s refreshed menu (pictured bottom right)! Braised beef check, carrot kimchi, free-range poached egg with wholemeal toast and a side of sweet potato-potato mash.
Always found the waffle range (both sweet and savoury) from Montana a very fail proof choice. This here is not the usual chicken with waffles you\'d expect! With the chive waffle is a five spice chicken confit, served with smoked ginger plum sauce and a side of smoked ginger plum coleslaw. 
-\n<br />This was a head turner! Resembling a bibimbap, this dish surely whets ones appetite. The carrot kimchi is the star here. It\'s spicy, soaked full of flavor and elevates the entire dish away from the mundane richness of braised beef.\n<br />-\n<br />Picture perfect goodness in a bowl of yumminess!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #montanasingapore
One of the star highlights of Montana\'s revamped menu is definitely their new desserts range - Freak Cakes (5 different flavours to choose from)! 
This freak cake tastes as good as it looks! Pillowy matcha sponge cake with matcha buttercream and black sesame frosting. With the black sesame powder base, the nuttiness dominates while the matcha lends a subtle bitterness. Good for 2-3 people to share!
The beef cheek was tender and went well with the sweet potato and potato mash. The carrot kimchi added a nice acidic twang. Served with wholemeal toast and a perfect poached egg! Really hearty dish!
The seasoning of the chicken is spot on - classic blend of five spice which brought an oriental flair. Like Peking duck, the skin is wonderfully crisp and flavourful. Unfortunately, the meat was a little dry. The smoked ginger plum sauce helped in bringing a pleasant sweetness that tied well with the chive waffles!
Linguine aglio olio was very good. Simplicity done right. The spiciness adds a fiery kick to the dish, and if you like it really spicy, you can opt for the white habenaro. The chunks of fresh crab meat is really the icing on the cake.
The burger patty is made of crab and seafood, kind of reminiscent of nonya otah, which I adore. Yuzu coleslaw brought a refreshing zest to the burger. The thick cut fries were crispy and full of potato!

Montana has got a spankin\' new menu! üìù Felt like trying something other than their waffles and this led to one of their pastas.üçù
Revamped menu has officially dropped at @montanasingapore and these are just a couple of the new items on it.
A whimsical assembly of childhood l Coffee kaya #freakcake. Have it with coconut shavings to balance with sugar
From eggs to sausages, waffles to toast, coffee, tea and me.\n<br />-\n<br />Nothing like great food to start the weekend.\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #montanasingapore
Love this take on an otah burger. Meaty, savoury spicy, the crab and seafood patty is full of flavour. Well worth ordering.
-\n<br />1 part fillet-o-fish, one part crab, one part Otak, one part prawn. \n<br />I\'m pleasantly confused by what I\'m tasting but it\'s just too damn good. It\'s just like a seafood platter had a party on my tongue. Add on the yuzu slaw and it\'s perfect!\n<br />The krusty crab will be proud.
-\n<br />A safe choice that strays not far from the original. I love anything century egg, so I would have liked a stronger tasting mash but I can\'t fault it. It\'s balanced, smooth and yummy.\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #montanasingapore
-\n<br />With five spices and ginger plum sauce, this east/west mash up is a hit. Personally I love the sweet ginger plum sauce, which goes perfectly with the tender chicken.\n<br />-\n<br />Love it!\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #montanasingapore
-\n<br />V60 filters have been around for awhile; what they\'ve done here is something out of the box, filtering chocolate.\n<br />What\'s left is this clean shot, that has the fullness of chocolate flavor without the mess that chocolate usually leaves behind on your tongue and throat.\n<br />Smooth, refined, satisfying.
My favorite mac and cheese has now become bite size balls that\'s oozing with flavor and melted cheese. It still comes with the slightly spicy salsa dip that I love. Yums!
Moist matcha sponge\n<br />That gives a punch\n<br />With matcha buttermilk cream\n<br />Making your internal scream\n<br />Topped with black sesame glaze\n<br />Making your heart go craze\n<br />.\n<br />If I need a better sweet\n<br />This will be a treat
Gorgeous cake! Always find matcha and kurogoma to be a perfect match.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This matcha sponge with matcha buttercream and black sesame glaze is topped with freaks such as a marshmallow, oreo cookie, green tea kit kat and pocky. But \"freak\" is a misnomer because these toppings actually lends well to the taste profile of this cake, nothing superfluous was added. I prefer a stronger matcha and kurogoma taste, but this suits sweet tooths who prefer their matcha to be more sweet less bitter. But I definitely like the additional texture and fragrance lent by the sesame frosting.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is an invited tasting.

As good as they were when I last had them a year ago - ‚ù§ the subtle flavor of jalape√±o in these.
Five spiced chicken done duck confit style, definitely melt-in-your-mouth tender, with crisp skin. Incredibly tasty and good! Love the crisp waffles too!
Montana never fails to impress me with their good food whenever I eat here. Beef cheeks portion was so generous and their sweet potato mash was so good. kimchi carrot and their poached eggs complimented it so well too ‚ù§Ô∏è\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br /> #beef #brunch #montana #burpple #singapore #montanasingapore
Nowhere as ghetto as its namesake, but it was definitely a basic burger done well. Moist and juicy patty, fluffy buns, melted stringy cheese, a greasy sunny-side up, and slices of well-cooked bacon. And when you consider that most of their burgers never cross the $15 mark, it\'s really worth the buck.
Still as good as the last time they just re-open. Totally underrated place. Their red velvet icecream ($14.50++) was probably the nicest in sg. Will i revisit again? Definitely yes!
Assam crab waffles ,sounds weird but it taste so good üëçüèªtheir waffles is the best ,this is \"must\" try dish in Montana
The assam crab waffles sound so weird we just had to try it. Surprisingly it works! Even the skeptic in our group was won over. The sauce is like a tamarind marmalade I want to bring home in a bottle &amp; slather on toasts. For $18, I wish there were more crab meats though.
Price: $14. This black velvet waffles is in fact black sesame waffles with green tea or black sesame ice cream. You have a choice of fluffy or crispy waffles; we chose the fluffy one and it was gooood. Overall there is a good balance of sweetness with appropriate tinges of saltiness, as one would expect from black sesame. 
Price: $14.50. Would visit Montana again for this. \'Waffles on crack\' - this was our final verdict. \'Layered\' was the word that came to me when I first bit into this. These red velvet waffles were amazingly well layered with the different layers complementing each other perfectly. First there was the sweet and pleasing rose smell that pervaded my senses. Then there was the sweet caramelized rose taste that arrested my taste buds -- the sweetness was so amazingly well balanced. It was sweet without being excessively so; the sweetness was also not the run-of-the-mill raw sugar sweet, but rather it had a certain rose-vanilla layer to it. After this sweetness came the very slight and very comfortable salty taste. This saltiness did not stay at all but rather it was a passing taste. It flashed past without me knowing. But as it flashes past, one would almost instantly wish that it would last a little longer. And finally, the taste comes full circle, and I was finally left with the pleasant rose-vanilla aftertaste that was sweet to a balanced degree. The waffles were also amazing texture-wise -- they were fluffy on the inside but firm and appropriately crisp on the outside. Oh and before I fail to mention, the ice cream by itself was also üòç and I would dare say put quite a few ice cream shops to shame. Overall it was amazing. The only thing I was confused about was that they only gave three triangles worth of waffles... So what happened to the last triangle?? But this is of course a point that should not distract us from ravenously digging in to these red velvet waffles. 
The best waffle that i ever eat in Singapore !Deserved my thumb üëçüèª
This is my first time trying @montanasingapore Black Velvet Waffle and I think it\'s one of the better waffles in Singapore. The black colour did not (only) serve as novelty purposes, but came as a result of sesame used in making the batter. Meanwhile, the black miso caramel was not overpowerlingly salty and was a creative substitute to the normal salted caramel sauce. All these paired with a scoop of green tea ice cream which I really enjoyed made up one of the best waffles in town, not to mention the crispy and fluffy texture of the waffle. Oh, and you can choose black sesame ice cream instead if you want a stronger sesame-waffle experience!
The waffles selection here is pretty unique. They have red velvet, chocolate banana, mango berry and the most uncommon one has to be black velvet waffle.
A must-try for any waffle lovers, Montana‚Äôs Black Velvet Waffle was really good - both in taste and texture. With an option of either fluffy or crisp waffle base, we chose the former which had a nice soft interior and thin crispy crust. The subtle flavour of black sesame in the waffle gave a tinge of sweetness and was further balanced with a scoop of bittersweet green tea ice cream crowned atop. The black miso caramel drizzle also lent an element of savoury to this satisfying creation. Yum! Fragrant and distinct,¬†I enjoyed the fact that every ingredient added to the experience and Montana is certainly one of the best places for some¬†unique waffle offerings.

Thick, fluffy black sesame waffles with a scoop of rich, aromatic green tea ice cream quite like Haagen Daaz. The miso caramel provides a tinge of saltiness and sweetness which complemented the bitter green tea ice cream and waffles well! Preferred this over the red velvet waffles. Pretty pricey at $14. 
The Black Velvet Waffles ($14) were phenomenal! My friend and I chose black sesame ice-cream for ours and my other friends tried the green tea flavour. Frangrant and flavourful goodness atop a fluffy base, the crunchy toppings were a lovely addition. Might consider these to be my favourite place for waffles so far! We also ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and Waffles ($14.50). A satisfying choice -- the chicken was pretty thick, had a crisp coating and was still moist and tender. Can\'t wait to be back to try more of their offerings üòõ
Something about the way they make their waffles at Montana, it always feels so natural as a savory dish!! The sous vide bulgogi beef slices are SO tender and the kimchi coleslaw really mellows out the spice.
I love this place a lot. There is good ambience and amazing waffles. This is certainly one of the best places to have waffles that is of different variety. There is this distinct black sesame taste in both the waffles and the ice cream. While it is a tad too pricey, I will definitely be willing to pay for such a treat!
I\'m not usually a fan of Mac &amp; Cheese cause after eating like 5 spoonfuls it gets wayy too gelat but I loved these waffles!! They were light and crispy, and had a delightfully fluffy interior even though it was stuffed with macaroni. The sweet and almost slightly sourish tomato relish was the perfect complement too~~

The Bronx Burger ($9.90) -\n<br />Touted as a \'South Bronx original\', with a \'signature sauce\', entire flavour of this burger was woefully commonplace. The flavour was actually strongly reminiscent of the beef and sauces serves at Pepper Lunch. For a burger place, I would have expected their \'original\' to be more, well, original.
Look at that ice cream. Look at that sauce drizzle. Now tell me that isn\'t friggin\' gorgeous.
Definitely the best waffles that I have tasted!! The black sesame ice cream was fabulous and the waffles was out of this world. Wouldn\'t really settle for other waffles.
Worth every single cent of the $14 I spent. The black sesame waffles was really amazing, never did I expect myself to be so satisfied!
Well it\'s South Bronx here but I was stuffed beyond distinction.
Wanted to try the Bulgogi Beef Waffles ($16.80++) from Montana for a long while, and it didn\'t disappoint.
Waffles were nice, but didn\'t really like the chicken - meat too soft and it wasn\'t crispy fried üò°
I can barely taste the cheese nor see e macaroni. the waffle is crispy yes but still quite disappointed. the salsa shld be cheese sauce to make the dish more mac&amp;cheese like. or put in an entire layer of cheese in the waffle!hahaha
{Truffle Egg Pasta} - $18, with mushrooms. How does this sound for a late night carb over-load supper? üòå #montanabrewbar
Jalapeno Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle @ $13.80+. There wasn\'t a hint of spiciness despite the name while some heat would have given punch to the dish. Expected gooey cheese within the waffle but in place was powdered cheddar cheese. Also preferred the tomato relish to be more tart than sweet for some zest. DESPITE the above, the waffle was so light and crispy, and the mac within was springy. The truffle oil was also prominent. The dish satisfied my waffles craving without being too heavy and I might order it again with adjusted expectation. Their Southern Fried Chicken Waffle is my top favorite savory waffle; I haven\'t tried their sweet waffles yet!
The black sesame waffles. Interesting taste coupled with green tea ice cream. Love the combination. But it is slightly pricey for waffles. $16 if I didn\'t remember wrongly. 
Dessert was a pretty sight üòç A lil saddd that waffles were burnt so I just finished up the ice cream üò≠\n<br />But great night catching up with bffs, please see me more often ok don\'t abandon me hahahaüåπ\n<br />#montanabrewbar
you get that bit of sourness from the asam yet not too overwhelming. the waffle compliments the crab and mangoes. mix the dish well and it would be a treat.
Move out of the way, you done-to-death chicken &amp; waffle combos, because this super well-conceived dish inspired by Asian flavours is possibly the best savoury waffle dish in existence. Composed with a soft lemongrass-infused waffle, chunks of pristine, succulent crabmeat, pickled mango salsa, and assam sauce, this is one perfect orgy of flavours on a plate ‚Äì a party in the mouth that you surely want an invitation to.
Mac and Cheese Fritters with Tomato Relish Dip and much needed 1 for 1 beer!!! Even tho it\'s just the start of the week (feel like my soul left my body üò≤). Apple &amp; Mango cider üçª and this other craft beer with dark chocolate notes and cacao yaaaas üç´
S$10.50 ‚Äî when you put waffles with chocolate with caramelised bananas and salted caramel ice cream it definitely is the sex. A really really cozy place to chill with friends. I\'ve not tried their other food just yet but I dare say their waffles is one of the best. They serve alcohol as well too! 
Known for their savory waffles, and being a seafood and chilli lover me, I\'ve set my eyes on their Assam Crab Waffle. Waffle batter made with 8 different herbs was a little dense with crispy edges, texture was a little heavy. But pairing with Assam Gula Melaka mayo gives it a touch of refreshing sweet, sour and faint piquant of assam flavors. Not forgetting the fresh succulent chunks of shredded crab meat, pineapple cucumber salsa. Definitely something creative and tantalizing to the taste buds! 
By far the best waffles I have tried although I don\'t take chocolate  . The waffles are crispy and combination with granola and sea salt caramel ice cream is really good! Will go back again !
Southern fried chicken burger is so yummy! My Boyfriend ordered The Bronx but he commented that Fat boy burger is better . However he also agreed that southern fried chicken burger is great!!! Not GST and service charge if dined  level one.
An absolute delight! Subtle sesame flavour from the fluffy (opt for crispy if you\'d like) black sesame waffles instead of the old-fashioned tasteless charcoal. Garnished with roasted sesame for more nutty fragrance! Drizzled with miso caramel, and opted for green tea ice cream. For people who aren\'t  that big on sweet desserts this is a pretty good option.
Our 3rd visit here, Montana\'s waffles never fail to disappoint! Beef Bulgogi Waffles ($16.80) might just be the best savoury waffle they offer. Made up of beef bulgogi, kimchi colesaw, gochujang rice waffles and a poached egg. Makes me wanna come back for a 4th time üòÖ
I learnt recently during a tasting at Roosevelt‚Äôs Diner &amp; Bar (managed by the same group) that the waffles here undergo several rounds of fine-tuning before the perfect balance was achieved, and it definitely paid off with the multiple positive reviews garnered. For this Black Velvet, you can decide how you want the waffle done (crispy or fluffy) and the ice cream flavour (matcha or black sesame). I could feel and hear the soft crunch while slicing through the black sesame waffle. The bittersweet nutty fragrance was very subtle on its own, but gladly so as it didn‚Äôt go over the top with the stronger flavour from the ice cream, and the miso caramel gave it a more dimensional profile. This is suitable for occasions when you don‚Äôt want your pancreas going into overdrive.
Grill-ty as charred! üòÇ \n<br />Featuring the \"grill-ty\" burger, The Bronx! (from South Bronx) Have a ham-bulous weekend ahead! üçîüíï
Marinated beef with gochucHang waffle with a semi cooked egg, it\'s the 2-in-1 favs.. On a plate. 
Set lunch menu was a steal with 1 main a drink for less than $15 ( after GST) but my vodka crab penne pasta was a disappointment as I could hardly taste any vodka. I would have preferred if they cooked my pasta a little longer. Will stick to their waffle creations next time. 
Willingly. Like this {Umami Burger} which was oh so yummy with the juicy and flavourful beef patty, mushrooms, bonito flakes and cheeeessseeeee üòçüòç\n<br />Slowly starting to think that burgers can be more than just unhealthy fast food hahaha üòÖ
Sandwiched between you get a giant ball of hazelnut rocher ice cream that came drizzled with coconut nutella sauce &amp; enhanced with crunchy granola toppings. The thai milk tea one was full of (very thai) rich flavours, enhanced with some mango white chocolate sauce. Keep very calm dear, as it‚Äôs time to get some ice cream üçî
Red Velvet Burger ‚Ä¢ Refreshing, sweet &amp; delightful. A sweet treat that you deserve üòâ Don\'t care about the extra calories, there\'s always tomorrow to diet haha üòÇ Have an awesome weekend ahead! üòã
Midweeks like these need a real kick and a midday spiked espresso sweetened with coconut water might just do the trick üí™üèª‚òïÔ∏è #FTrecommends
my craving for ice cream and waffles has been going crazy this whole week, so i decided to drop by here to try the Red Velvet Waffle Stack ($14.50). it definitely satisfied my craving oh my. 
had the Pesto Chicken Penne ($14) for lunch. though the presentation of this dish wasn\'t great, the flavour was definitely something. Montana\'s homemade Pesto sauce was üòç the shredded chicken could\'ve been less dry though. nowadays everything is about presentation, so i hope Montana changes the look of their pasta dishes!
On a Friday night we decided we wanted waffles for our main course AND dessert! We tried the mac &amp; cheese waffle and the southern fried chicken waffle - both delicious. The dessert waffles were what blew us away! Red velvet, chocolate/banana, and mango/berry all topped with complementing ice cream flavors? We were in waffle heaven! We also tried their special coconut water cold brew coffee and it was DELICIOUS. Very reasonable prices too (waffles were on average $14). 
A savory waffle that looks simple on the outside but bursting with flavors on the inside! So good!
Craving another Truffle Spam burger - the combination of flavours from the salty spam, fragrant truffle, and sweet and tangy pineapple would make for an awesome lunch! The soft potato buns really make this dish. This burger is rather simple, but packing in so much flavour. If you want something fuss-free but still satisfying, then this is for you. 
‚ò∫Ô∏èüëåüèª This time we tried the assam crab waffles and bulgogi beef waffles. The latter was our pick!üòãüëçüèª But I still like their Jalape√±o Mac &amp; cheese waffles best. üòÅ ps: today is a good day for some cold brew too! üåû
Need to return for those fluffy potato burger buns and on point waffles (love the Truffle Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese and Black Sesame ones most!), stat. #burpple #foodspotting @montanasingapore
Having moved up a level from their first floor digs, Montana (previously Montana Brew Bar) now boasts a bigger shop space and a three-in-one concept that includes pastas, burgers and doughnuts, on top of a greater selection of their popular waffles. Go straight for the waffles, especially the creative savoury ones like their well-loved Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle ($12), Bulgogi Beef Waffle ($16) and the much raved about Assam Crab Waffle ($18). Inspired by Kedah laksa, the latter comes topped with fresh crab meat, pineapple cucumber salsa and the pi√®ce de r√©sistance, assam gula Melaka mayo. The new and improved Red Velvet Waffle 2.0 ($14.50), now served with strawberry shortcake ice cream and white chocolate rose syrup, makes an excellent dessert, especially when paired with a glass of the Coconut Cold Brew (from $6.80). The coconut water cuts through the coffee\'s acidity while adding a hint of natural sweetness.
YES YOU HEARD IT üò± \n<br />My number one favourite at Montana üòç  With the right amount of truffle oil and their amazing waffle, it has definitely left me craving for me.  I would recommend getting this if you\'re coming here for the first time. You might even be back for more üòù
Ingenious creation, especially so since it\'s dyed with black sesame powder instead of the typical tasteless charcoal powder (in my opinion an equivalent to food colouring). With black miso caramel, bomb diggity sesame crumble and matcha icecream. Favourite dessert for sharing at @montanasingapore after those satiating @southbronxburger! Once you go black.. üòé
Strawberry shortcake icecream, rose caramel sauce. Everything a girl would want her sweet sixteenth party to be: sweet, frilly, impressionable. \n<br />14.5bucks/waffle
I love craft beers, so I was glad to see a pretty extensive menu here at South Bronx/Montana.   The dark lager ($14) was nothing too complex : malty, smooth, and surprisingly well balanced with sweetness and hints of savoury notes from the brewing of red miso, giving rise to a subtle miso aftertaste. 
üçª Have a blastin\' good time this holiday and sit back and relax while the party is going on üéäüéâ
Red velvet waffle with strawberry shortcake ice cream and drizzled white chocolate rose syrup - a treat fit for a princess indeed. Montana does their waffles really well - crispy outside, but light and fluffy inside. For me, the rose flavouring wasn\'t too overpowering, and everything came together really nicely. This is sure to satisfy all those with a sweet tooth out there.
These affordable delish burgers from South Bronx at the invited tasting by Montana were definitely the highlight of my night.
Tried this Red Velvet Waffle ($14.50) during our invited tasting at Montana - I\'m not really a fan of gimmicky red velvet but I liked this princessy version from Montana. Not your usual cream cheese and red velvet pairing. The light and fluffy texture of waffle as usual, did not disappoint. Waffles were stacked and served with creamy strawberry shortcake ice cream, drizzled with perfumy white chocolate rose syrup. I actually liked the Rose syrup that reminded me of Bandung. Get this for a sweet ending to a good meal.
Appropriate termed \"The Black Velvet\", I already liked this black sesame waffle so much more than the other \'charcoal\' ones out there that are just plain waffles blackened with food colouring. As someone who doesn\'t usually like black sesame, this really stood out for me. The combination of black sesame and green tea was perfect. The waffle was fluffy, with an almost cake-like texture (you can go for crispy if you want), and the black sesame crumbled provided a nice crunchy texture. If you want an extra dose of black sesame, you can choose that flavour of ice cream instead! Would really appeal to all the black sesame lovers out there. 
Montana has become the first Coconut Cold Brew Specialist with 4 signature coconut cold brews on its menu. This is done by steeping ground coffee in coconut water which adds a hint of sweetness. On left is the Regular Coconut Cold Brew ($6.80) and right is Yuzu ($7.80). Not in the photo are Gula Melaka ($6.80) and Kahlua ($12). Ice spheres served with the drinks are made of coconut water as well.
Instead of your usual beef patty, this burger switches things up by having a prawn patty instead. The intense yet distinct Thai flavours coupled with the juicy prawn patty with chunks of fresh prawn made this one of the highlights of the meal. While the flavours from each component (lemongrass prawn patty, green curry mayo, mango red onion coleslaw) are really strong, they complimented each other brilliantly. And their homemade potato buns are really to die for - soft and fluffy, with a hint of sweetness from the potato, and toasted to perfection. I could probably eat a couple of these on my own!
String luncheon meat and truffle in the same sentence and I\'m definitely down for it! The peeps behind @southbronxburger have stacked a couple of thick cut spam, house-smoked bacon strips, pineapple rings, spritz of white truffle oil and a fried egg between a pair of potato burger buns. \n<br />Sounds like something you\'re able to recreate at home? Then wait till you taste these buns; sweet pillowy, baked fresh daily! Thoughtful, fulfilling, effortlessly chic and downright delicious. \n<br />Special thanks to our hostess of the night, Shiying of @montanasingapore and @burpple for organizing dinner!
Nope, that\'s not your charcoal waffles! The Black Velvet Waffle is a black sesame waffle with your choice of green tea or black sesame ice cream and drizzled with black miso caramel. You will also get to choose between fluffy or crispy textured waffles. I am honestly not a fan of both black sesame and green tea flavors in desserts (I know, I know) but this combination was a genius idea. The whole dish arrived with a strong aroma of roasted black sesame. Sweetness from the green tea ice cream and waffle was such a delight with the slightly savory miso sauce - a well handled balance. 
This Assam Crab Waffle is the creation of inspirations from the Kedah Laksa, a dish which is very similar to what we are more familiar with, the Assam Laksa. A specialty blend of 8 spices are used and the waffles are topped with crab meat and pineapple cucumber salsa. On the side you\'ll find the assam gula melaka mayo. This dish didn\'t sound too appetizing to me at the start but I was pleasantly surprised how everything went so well together! The mayo especially was a burst of sweet, sour and savory flavors. It was so tangy and addictive, I found myself scraping all the sauce off the plate with the waffle! This is one dish I\'ll come back for.
Always in a dilemma when deciding which cut of fries to choose? You won\'t face that problem in Montana and South Bronx Burger where you can find 3 different cuts of hot crispy fries in one serving! 
A reddish-brown dark lager brewed with a hint of miso paste. There\'s a slight sweetness but you can definitely taste the salty component in it. I\'ll stick to my sweeter choices but if you\'re curious to know how it tastes, you can find this on South Bronx Burger\'s menu when you\'re dining here in Montana! 
Behold the grand dame -- probably the most Instagrammed dessert at Montana, and it sure lived up to towering expectations. Huge scoops of strawberry shortcake ice cream were wedged between crisp waffles, laced with a titillating white chocolate rose sauce that perfumed each bite. A lovely combination that\'s elegant, yet utterly refreshing. 
This is as far from a typical sweet dessert as you can get. Honestly, I enjoyed its deliciously complex aroma and taste more than I expected. The fluffy (or crispy - yes, you can choose!) black sesame-flavoured waffle came topped with black miso caramel sauce, toasted sesame and a big ball of green tea ice-cream. If you\'re a huge fan of black sesame, you\'ll be pleased to know they offer that as an ice-cream flavour too. 
Waffles and burgers overload at the newly revamped Montana - my tummy is blessedü§óInteresting drinks menu too, with coconut cold brew and pretty cool craft beer. Thank you Montana for hosting, and Burpple for the invite!
I try to sum up my South Bronx experience last night -- a burger epiphany sounds about right.
A delicious deviant in a (burger) world dominated by meats like beef, pork, and chicken -- exactly what @MontanaSingapore set out to achieve. Featuring crisp-juicy, made-from-scratch prawn patties suffused with the slightly sweet and wildly aromatic nuances of its lemongrass marinade, green curry mayo and mango red onion coleslaw, this is such a winner with its refreshingly vibrant flavours. The sweet-tangy-savoury combination goes perfectly with those delightful potato buns, sending the senses a-tingle with every bite.
How perfect that I am posting this on a Fry-day! Heehee... But puns aside, why settle for one type of fries when you can have three all at once? And they\'re equally gorgeous in their golden crunchiness too. I didn\'t even need to dip them in any ketchup or chilli sauce because I found them well-seasoned.  
I can\'t get enough of luncheon meat so this \"Truffled Spam Burger\" is a dream come true. Layered between wonderfully soft and fluffy housemade buns (toasted and buttered perfectly) is a slab of crisped luncheon meat redolent with truffle oil, along with smoked bacon, sweet pineapple, a fried egg and mayo. It\'s my favourite item of all that we had at tonight\'s invited tasting at Montana. 
Yes, this is THE Jalape√±o Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle that created quite a furore when Montana Brew Bar first launched it. Only this is version 2.0 (post-rebranding), which imo surpasses its predecessor on the tasty quotient. Encased within the crisp waffle were truffle-infused, slightly cheesy mac &amp; cheese, fragrantly permeating every bite. The tomato jalape√±o relish was mouthwateringly tangy, enlivening the dish with piquant bursts of flavour and a mildly spicy kick.
Though on paper this sounded a tad newfangled for my liking, it eventually won me over with its brilliant execution and innovative flavours. Inspired by Kedah laksa (quite similar to Penang assam laksa), Asian aromatics such as lemongrass, galangal, turmeric were infused into the waffle itself, which was topped with chunks of fresh, sweet crab meat and housemade pineapple cucumber salsa.
Gochujang rice waffles, kimchi coleslaw, beef bulgogi and a poached egg. Savoury waffles done right üòä didn\'t enjoy the stringy beef though!
It\'s been a long time ! 2 weeks to be exactüòÇ I\'m in need of some awesome possum #coldbrew #manmakecoffee
üò≥\n<br />Somehow Montana was able to perfect this interesting dish and left me craving for more after i was done. üòõ\n<br />There was a generous portion of fresh crab meat and other garnishes on the waffles and the sauce is pretty amazing! üòã\n<br />Still having a hard time decide between Truffle mac&amp;cheese waffles or this dish as my favourite at Montana üòÖ\n<br />Head down to their new outlet at POMO to give it a try!
4.5 munchies: Made with a specialty blend of eight spices, galangal, lemongrass and other herbs, the mildly-spiced waffle was crisped and light throughout; topped with crab meat chunks and pineapple cucumber salsa. The standout element for me had got to be the creamy assam gula melaka mayo dipping ‚Äì so good that I almost wiped out the tangy, sweet and salty sauce with my finger even after finishing the waffles!
Our charming red velvet waffle stack is now served with strawberry shortcake ice cream instead of the old vanilla, still drizzled with the white chocolate rose syrup we love. So fluffy I cannot.
With burgers (AND triple fries) so affordably priced from just $12 to $16 each, this is one burger party that practically anybody can, and should, crash.
@montanasingapore just revamped their menu and expanded its store at POMO! Head down to take a look and check out their mouth-watering savory waffles! \n<br />Thanks once again @montanasingapore for the invite :)

2.5 munchies: Featuring 4 out of the 5 Coconut Cold Brew launched recently at the newly expanded Montana Singapore, my picks are the mildly sweet Regular and refreshing Kahlua with orange juice. Not a fan of the sour, bitter Nitro at all, as well as the Gula Melaka that I prefer in my local desserts.
The lovely folks at #MontanaSingapore are sure passionate about their waffles; such that the spin they gave to their unique batter definitely did much justice to all the ingredients. By far my favourite from them, &amp; great regardless whether you have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 4.5/5\n<br />Worth your calories? üíï\n<br />üì∑ Credits: @whychxr &amp; @blancheeze
Mac Daddy - The beef patty was decent, abit moist and juicy. The jalape√±o on top of it was too spicy for my liking though, which packed a really extra strong kick to me! It will be even better if they throw in some juicy tomatoes inside this Mac Daddy. Oh, oh and the Mac N Cheese. Didn\'t seemed to have a wow factor to me even though they integrated inside the burger, nothing really special.
It\'s crispy waffles heaven with both savory and sweet waffles at Montana Brew Bar, Pomo $14 #burpple
Korean-inspired waffles using rice and gochujang instead of the typical waffle batter ‚Äì don\'t expect these to be airy and fluffy because they\'re meant to be denser and more cakey.
The savory waffle was quite unique and yummy! Not sure where\'s the truffle in the pasta though.

Moist, tender and absolutely flavorful bulgogi beef topped on a cake-ish waffle with kimchi slaw, finished with a perfectly poached egg.
And it did not disappoint! It\'s reminded me of a frozen Soi 55üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç $6.90+ [Thai Milk Tea Ice cream Burger]
The green curry mayo was a bit spicy for me but I don\'t really like spicy foods but the potato buns were fabulous! \n<br />Definitely a great job for a fusion burger!!! üçîüçîüçîüçîüçî
Second time having this Black Velvet Waffle and I\'m still very much in love! The roasty fragrance is so intense, and the fluffy+crisp texture is faultless. This time I could actually taste the lovely miso caramel! Adds a slight malty salted dimension that\'s really interesting.
They sure remind me of the Mac n cheese bites I had on a weekly basis at @sheetz!! These lil balls of cheesey macaroni and salsa is so good!!!
 ($18) - Interesting and the light tanginess grew on me after a few bites. Especially the Assam gula melaka mayo on the side. Not a lot of crab meat but oh well. Served with pineapple cucumber salsa. Thought the waffle was quite well done in terms of texture - crispy and fluffy. Their other savoury waffles sounds good too! 
Hallelujah!\n<br />It\'s raining corn! Amen! \n<br />It\'s raining corn on my Southern fried chicken and waffles
He loves the waffles from @MontanaSingapore \n<br />His fav is the Chocolate Banana Waffles. \n<br />Let him show you why.
It\'s Monster\'s last day of work for the week. Gonna be in KL tomorrow for a 3 day cafe hopping challenge. \n<br />Can\'t wait to get my drink on!
A tad too sweet but such a pretty pink it is. Definitely instagrammable!
It was stacked with strawberry shortcake ice cream and drizzled with white chocolate rose syrup. I loved the combination of flavors.
Currently my favorite thing for this month. An unholy matrimony of sweet and savory flavors all one plate. \n<br />Audible crisp black sesame waffles, as airy as the air you breathe. A choice between Yoda matcha or black Vader sesame ice cream. \n<br />The secret deathstar of the dish is their special miso caramel. Umami awesomeness that brought balance to the force. \n<br />Monster thinks the grey Jedi is a reality about to come true. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #montanabrewbar
Hailing from @southbronxburger comes their dessert burgers of the following flavors:\n<br />Red Velvet ($6.90), with hazelnut rocher ice cream, coconut nutella sauce and granola toppings.\n<br />Black Sesame ($6.90), with green tea ice cream and azuki red beans.\n<br />Thai Iced tea ($5.90), with butter bun and Thai iced tea ice cream.\n<br />Berries and Cream ($5.90), strawberry cheese cake ice cream and housemade berry sauce.
Mmm.
@MontanaSingapore has a new kid on the block! Located on the 1st level of PoMo, town dwellers now have more excuse to enjoy a party anytime of the day ‚Äì imagine having a waffle-burger-donut kind of situation, geez! Anyway, burgers introduction: ‚Ä¢ The Bronx ($9.90) ‚Äì South Bronx Original, with house-made beef patty, signature sauce, smoked bacon &amp; melted cheese slice.\n<br />‚Ä¢ Southern Fried Chicken ($10.90) ‚Äì Brioche bun, Southern fried chicken patty (marinated, braised &amp; deep-fried), topped with spicy southern coleslaw.\n<br />‚Ä¢ Lemongrass Prawn ($10.90) ‚Äì Asian American ‚Äì aroi lemongrass prawn patty, mango red onion coleslaw &amp; green curry mayo. *Personal favourite, so good it could be illegal.
Totally something I\'d dig for breakfast. Or lunch. Or dinner. Or supper. Actually, I\'d dig this any time of day. There\'s a thick slice of spam stacked with a fried egg and smoked bacon between cushiony potato buns, and next to all that ‚Äì a pile of criss-cut fries, shoestring fries and curly fries fried so golden they practically project their own halo gleaming over themselves.
Moist hand formed beef patty, coated in creamy mac &amp; cheese, with a sour spicy kick from jalapeno slices! Messy but good!
Black sesame waffles drizzled with miso caramel  and topped with black sesame ice cream.  Wondering what happened to the chocolate coated vanilla option when this was first launched.
Featuring (from left to right) The Bronx, Southern Fried Chicken Burger &amp; Lemongrass Prawn Burger. If you\'re adventurous and want something different, Lemongrass Prawn Burger is something you might not want to miss! If you prefer to be on the safe side, you can never go wrong with The Bronx Burger! Many thanks to @southbronxburger for hosting us again as well as for the warm hospitality, and @blancheeze for the invite! üòä
The former, an inspiration from Kedah Laksa, is a waffle served with crab meat, pineapple cucumber salad and assam gula melaka mayo. Besides waffles, you can also opt for other pasta dishes and a selection of coconut cold brew to go with your meal. Instead of water, coconut water was used to enhance the sweetness of the brew and I will recommend the Regular ($6.50) for the natural flavour profile. For the adventurous, there\'s the Yuzu ($7.80) and Nitro ($7), which seek to appeal the different taste buds.
And the cow I\'d love to have right now would come in the form of The Mac Daddy. \n<br />Yep, Mac &amp; Cheese atop a homemade beef patty, encased in soft freshly baked buns üòç. I loved the jalape√±os that are hidden in the Mac &amp; cheese, spicing up the wonderful flavours that go on in that seemingly unassuming burger. And that sweetness from the homemade melt-in-the-mouth buns (made from potatoes) further accentuates all the beefy flavours. #burpple #burppletastemaker #montanasg #whati8today #8dayseat #foodporn #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafescene #sgig #sgeatapp #sgeat #burger #burgers #macandcheese
Loving the hexagonal theme of the newly expanded Montana Brew bar. \n<br />Their signature ice cream waffle still retains its crispy crunch, whilst giving us a one two flavor punch. Such decadence. \n<br />Sadly the burgers were sold out the second time I was back. \n<br />Monster will be back for meat! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #montanabrewbar
A Mediterranean inspired waffle, with lots of bits and pieces. Personally it feels more like a prawn salsa than paella. It\'s lacking a uniting factor to tie the dish together. Perhaps some spicy tomato based salsa might bring out that paella feel. \n<br />Over all still a nice dish to try. The flavors on the prawn and chorizos we\'re great. \n<br />Monster has a craving for rice now. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #montanabrewbar
These guys understand the simple lesson that the waffle must also contribute to what\'s placed on it, and that makes all the difference. #burpple
If you love anything hot &amp; spicy, this pasta is a must try! For someone who has a high threshold for spicy food, I find this to be a challenge too!üòãüí™üèªüëçüèª
Sweeten up your second last weekday morning with this regular coconut brewüå¥. The cold brew with coconut ice sphere was lightly sweet and smooth, an unusual pairing that greatly pleased our palettes.
House made gourmet ice cream buns with 4 unique flavours (Thai Ice Tea, Black Sesame, Red Velvet and Salted Yolk) were launched yesterday @southbronxburger. We had Red Velvet even though we were too full from waffles. Ferrero Rocher ice cream \"patty\" with granola base, drizzled some Nutella sauce over and placed on the bun. Now that\'s a burger I LOVE!
This ice cream burger comes with Ferrero Rocher ice cream, coconut Nutella sauce and red velvet buns. This new place serves really good burgers, both savoury and sweet. I love them all!!! üòã #shiok #happytummy 
The Red Velvet Ice Cream Burger ($6.90) - 2 red velvet buns holding a large scoop of Ferrero Rocher Ice Cream. That iconic Chocolate made ice cream really took centre stage over here - creamy yet not overly sweet paired with some coconut Nutella sauce (but there wasn\'t much coconut taste to it). The buns could be slightly more toasted to further enhance the flavour of the buns :)
The center stays gooey &amp; cheesy, while the edges get crisp &amp; browned, the flavours were also elevated with truffle oil &amp; tomato relish. &amp; Honestly, for it to still taste so good after around 20-30 minutes of photo taking, you can imagine how it‚Äôd be if I had it hot.\n<br />This was a hosted tasting by @MontanaSingapore
A laksa waffle is mind boggling, to say the least. What shocks me even more is how well put together this is. Created with 8 different spices (that are used to make the Kedah laksa), the waffle was surprisingly well balanced and delightful. But what made it such a winner is not the chunks (yes, chunks) of crab meat nor the innovative pineapple cucumber salsa. It is that assam gula melaka mayo that was so creamy, sweet and sourish all at the same time. If we could lick that sauce bowl clean, we would. 
If there\'s any reason to try the burgers at South Bronx, it should be for their unbelievably light potato buns. Taking over the now defunct The Connoisseur Coffee (TCC) at POMO, this is the second establishment by the people behind Montana Brew Bar. With Fabulous Dough (doughnuts) and Montana (waffles and pasta) on the second floor, and South Bronx Burger on the first, POMO seems like the new place to be. This small, light-filled space brims with energy from the colourful graffiti on the wall and \'90s hip-hop blasting through the speakers, a nod to the South Bronx in New York City. Come by with a friend or two, and start by sharing the Beer Battered BBQ Chicken Wings ($7). Show some love to the Mac Daddy ($12), a premium US and Australian beef blend patty topped with a spicy, sinful Jalape√±o mac and cheese. Alternatively, indulge in The Umami ($11), where miso mushroom, furikkake mayo and bonito flakes form a party in a your mouth. Do yourself a favour and top up $4 to enjoy a side of triple fries ‚Äî a genius mix of normal fries, cross cut fries and twister fries (!) along with a soft drink. Don\'t leave without sharing the Red Velvet ($6.90) ice cream burger that features Ferrero Rocher ice cream and coconut Nutella sauce in a red velvet bun, or the Black Sesame ($6.50) for a less cloying option ‚Äî fluffy black sesame buns sandwiching green tea ice cream and azuki red beans. Wash it all down with a craft beer, currently 1-for-1 ($12 for two) from 6pm till closing!
Our Favourite will definitely be the Beef Bulgogi Waffles ($16) - made with gochujang rice interestingly included into the waffle batter topped with souv vide beef slices, kimchi coleslaw and a poached egg! All of the flavours flow really well together along with tender thinly slice meat and tangy sauces. Paired your meal with their Coconut Cold Brew ($6.50), we fell in love with the creamy regular one). Thank you Ying for hosting us last night and sharing with us all the interesting information about palettes! And thanks @juliuslim for extending the invite!
I mean Ice Cream Burger. Just 2 hours after its launch. Hardcore dessert fans. [Salted Yolk Ice Cream Burger S$6.90] - salted yolk bun, with coconut ice cream, drizzled with salted egg cream sauce. Didn\'t like the combi of the coconut ice cream which overpower the taste of the milder salted egg cream sauce. We tried a salted egg cream sauce version 2 and it\'s much better.
Back at the newly expanded Montana brew bar with their updated menu and boy, was it refreshing. They have included a section of specialty coconut infused cold brew with various flavor palettes. \n<br />The yuzu had contrasting bitter tones between the zesty yuzu citrus and the coffee. The underlying coconut was the tying factor that brought unity to the drink. Definitely worth a try for any yuzu lovers. \n<br />Monster loves coconut coffee. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #montanabrewbar
So cripsy we thought it was deep fried. One of the best waffles I\'ve had!
Following their menu revamp, they\'ve done away with some unnecessary frills on the previous version and streamlined this so what we\'re left with are really all that matter ‚Äì impeccably crisp yet fluffy waffles vertically sandwiching fat scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, with salted caramel sauce and a smattering of blueberries for just enough pizzazz.
One can finish a plate of on his/her own without feeling heavy on the stomach after a few mouths, unlike many other places I\'ve tried.\n<br />The urban chic cafe at Pomo have also recently launched the ‚ú®world\'s first coconut cold brew menu!

Wonderful crisp texture and a slight savoury tinge of the black sesame/ miso caramel
Love the entire combination on the plate!üëåüèª Especially the black miso caramel which has helped to balance the sweetness of the waffle and ice cream. üòãüëçüèª .\n<br />.\n<br />Ps: if you love all things black, opt for black sesame ice cream instead of green tea! Yes, you get to choose between them and it was a tough one! Wish I could have both!üòÇ
The lovely folks at @MontanaSingapore are sure passionate about their waffles; such that the spin they gave to their unique batter definitely did much justice to all the ingredients. By far my favourite from them, &amp; great regardless whether you have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
.\n<br />Following its recent shift to a bigger shop front on 2nd level, Montana has also introduced a new savoury waffle made from a variety blend of spices topped with chunky crab meat, salsa salad and paired with their special concoction of gula melaka sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />While spiced waffle with gula melaka sauce can be a little heavy in flavour, the salsa in turn neutralizes the overall taste experience and provides a refreshing take to the savory waffle.
Tried their savory waffles which were pretty tasty, featuring here were their Assam Crab Waffle, Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle and Seafood Paella Waffle. Personally, I liked their Seafood Paella Waffle and Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese Waffle. \n<br />Montana has recently shifted to level 2 at POMO with more seats. Head down to give it a try!
It is noteworthy that they put in the extra effort in making their waffles significantly different from the others. Tomato relish came in handy, making the overall dish refreshing.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />P.S This was a hosted tasting by @montanasingapore üç¥
What\'s better than mac &amp; cheese? Mac and cheese rolled into balls, coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried. It pays to be sinful sometimes.

If anyone tells you they tasted a special \'red velvet\' flavour in red velvet anything, they\'ve either found some culinary genius I\'ve yet to meet or simply don\'t know what they\'re talking about. Aside from the stunning colours, there\'s nothing superb about this flavoured waffle. 
The allure of this dark beauty lies in its batter, which is infused with nutty black sesame and when cooked in the griddle, produces a waffle that is successfully faultless ‚Äì a crisp crust that gives way to a soft, fluffy bite.
The most important aspect about savoury waffles is to make them as light &amp; airy as possible so they won\'t be too overwhelming or what we refer to as \"Jelat\" - which I think they\'ve nailed it perfectly! One can finish a plate of on his/her own without feeling heavy on the stomach after a few mouths, unlike many other places I\'ve tried.\n<br />The urban chic cafe at Pomo have also recently launched the ‚ú®world\'s first coconut cold brew menu! Pictured above is a stunning glass of Gula Melaka Coconut Cold Brew ($6.80), with lush notes of caramel &amp; toasted nuts.
This is probably one of the most incredible artery-clogging combination I had at @southbronxburger, 1 of the sister concept by @montanasingapore.
This black beauty seriously had put many mediocre charcoal waffles to shame. You can taste the distinctive roasted black sesame flavor in every bite, with the subtle flavor of miso caramel sauce complementing it. The black chocolate coated vanilla ice cream does prevent itself from melting fast but personally I think it will be even better with a black sesame ice cream instead, for black sesame lover like me.

One of their more outstanding creations, this fluffy waffle is stuffed with rice and lettuce marinated in gochujang!
Black Velvet Waffles with a black sesame base and miso caramel sauce. And a surprise beneath the \'black\' ice cream at the revamped Montana Singapore. \n<br />And since there are FREE rides on the Downtown Line today (till 1 Jan), am making full use of it for the convenience. Haha. \n<br />Drop at the new Rochor MRT and make a short walk over. \n<br />#DTL2 #closerthanyouthink @LTAsg
Sweet, caramelised banana slices, fragrant vanilla bean ice cream, on a crisp, light, chocolate waffle. Yum!
Bright and cheery, the light cream sauce is scented with truffle oil, complementing the wild mushrooms and sunny side up egg. Simple comfort food!
Inspired by the Malaysian Kedah Assam Laksa, this fluffy waffle is fragant with galangal and lemongrass, topped with fresh crab meat, and a sweet pineapple cucumber salsa!
With a new year comes a new name, and a new menu! Formerly known as Montana Brew Bar, they\'ve occupied a new space in PoMo.
Back the newly opened Montana which is now located on the second floor. Tried the Assam crab waffle $18 - pleasantly surprised at the flavour. This Assam spiced waffle was moist and flavorful, along side with seasoned crab meat and pineapple cucumber salsa. Pretty good overall, would suggest sticking to their waffles, the truffle egg pasta on the other hand was disappointing.
Black sesame waffle with dark chocolate coated vanilla ice cream and black miso caramel.
Featuring their new savoury waffle, Assam Crab Waffle (SGD $18), which is one of my new favourite in Montana Singapore. Assam + Waffle? I thought it would be a weird combination but it didn\'t let me down. Not your typical crispy waffles as they used a different batter, together with some secret ingredients to give it a dimension of flavours in this new creation. Generously dressed with seasoned crab meat, pineapple and cucumber salsa that adds a touch of visual beauty and also enhance the overall taste. Served together with Assam gula melaka mayo at the side. This is a winning combination for me!
the provide you with a cold brew in a laboratory like flask.
There\'s new pasta in their menu too! Smoked salmon spaghetti ($15), anything cream base are my soft spot. -M
One of it is the black velvet waffle ($14). Black sesame waffle with black miso caramel and black chocolate coated vanilla ice cream. A Creative one indeed. Love it that Montana did not create something just to follow the influx of Charcoal waffle that taste just like any normal waffle (paying for the black look not taste). -M
.
Manic cravings for this Black Sesame Waffle. The black waffle\'s not just for show; instead aggressively flavoured with roasted black sesame seeds, topped with a scoop of chocolate-encased vanilla bean ice cream, and a drizzle of homemade miso caramel. Miso caramel may sound odd, but what that translates to is a mellow, earthy caramel with a hint of saltiness; much like salted caramel. Bold yet stunning flavours. A breath of fresh air from the influx of disappointing charcoal waffles. I think I\'ve got myself a new favourite!
Newly (re-)opened Montana\'s added several new creations to their waffle menu, along with previous all-time favourites like the Jalape√±o Mac n Cheese. My fave of the lot however has to be this new Assam Crab Waffles. Essentially a waffle-lised assam laksa, the batter was interlaced with shredded galangal, lemongrass, and a variety of herbs. Fragrant, fluffy, yet crisp on the outside, the savoury waffle comes beautifully paired with sweet fresh crab, a pineapple-cucumber salsa, and a delish assam sauce. The combination sounds odd, but don\'t dismiss it quite so soon for you may find it shockingly yummy.
1) sir spam a lot - spam what else
It is now much bigger and better.\n<br />As for the pasta and drink, definitely above average, nothing much to really pick on. =)\n<br />Maybe I will try their speciality - waffles, next time. =D \n<br />#burpple
Savoury waffles, anyone? Besides their signature waffles, check out new waffles such as the Beef Bulgogi Waffle and Assam Crab Waffle in their new shop space (same building, POMO). Bigger and definitely very hipster!
Best. Matcha. Waffles. Ever! *^* The matcha flavour was real and not just some artificial food colouring and the sweet white chocolate sauce with vanilla ice cream went really well with the mango burst! It may seem a lot of different Flavours but they really do go well together! Also, it\'s value for money &gt;&gt;&gt; at only $9.50 without GST :\'D 
.
This is the bombz man! It\'s so good because the waffles are really crispy and almost crunchy! üòä Waffle lovers, you won\'t be disappointed! Their tea selections are not too bad too. üëçüèº a nice getaway from the crowd on a Sunday evening! It\'s in POMO and it\'s a hidden gem! Check out this place out soon before it gets a big crowd coming! 
Loving the Chocolate Banana Waffles here, simply so crispy, fluffy and delicious though I wish they could be a little warmer!
My cuppa Chai Tea Latte at Montana Brew Bar\'s tasting back in July, thanks to Geraldine Tay\'s invite üòò 
Coffee break! Regrettably was too stuffed to try their famous waffles. 
Good old Fried Chicken + Waffle at nett pricing. Really enjoyed the crispy outerior and fluffy goodness waffles! Chicken was succulent and coated with a spice which wasn\'t easy for a non-spicy noob me. Coffee was superbbbbb. One of the best beans I\'ve ever tried served in a generous cup. Definitely recommended, even though cafe was kinda small and not for long chill seating. But with food and coffee that good? Would come back for more anytime.
The haze-y weather makes me lose my appetite badly while, simultaneously, crave for some extremes (i.e. assam spicy fish, tan tan ramen, raw oysters). What\'s more is that my tastebuds keep giving me the problem of \"not-spicy-enough\". So I bumped into this Spicy Bacon Pasta and found myself pampered by loads of bird\'s eye chilli. Rest assured, you can adjust the level of spiciness to suit your tastebuds. (This is level 4 which is the highest)

monday need coffee with a good body
Very accessible location with affordable prices. One of the rare coffee places that\'s open on a Monday! Chase your Monday blues away with a cuppa joe (which are double-shot, by the way) at Montana Brew Bar. \n<br />Also includes delectable waffles; crispy exterior and fluffy interior.
Not a red velvet person but ordered this anyway because my friend is and it just blew my mind away. The waffles here never disappoint, so expect the same crisp and fluffy waffles. Each waffle quarter smells and tastes sweetly of rose syrup (in a good way), which also perfectly complemented the vanilla ice cream. Needless to say, it was great treat for my friend and I. 
The Spicy Bacon Pasta Level 1 is too spicy for a weakling like me. But I am in love with this Southern Fried Chicken Wafflewich. It is the perfect savory waffles. I love the flavors of the Southern Fried Chicken. Price is between $11.50 to $13.50 www.littlemisshoney.com
This is the best chicken waffles that I\'ve tried so far!
But to be honest, it taste pretty good and on my own scale of spice level, it is about 6-7/10. So if level 4, it should be quite for someone who loves spicy food.
At last I managed to try the famed waffles of Montana Brew Bar. It has been on my list for a longgg time now. We ordered the chocolate banana waffle and pesto chicken pasta. Needless to say, the waffle stole the show. It was soft and crunchy at the same time and we could taste the chocolate in the waffles. The pairing with caramelised bananas and vanilla ice cream was perfect. I heard they have good burgers too after 5pm, which will be on my order list next time :)
Oh man, I feel like I\'m a huge fan of their waffles. I\'ve Tried their matcha, chicken, red velvet and Mac and cheese waffles!
Just because of the Red Velvet Waffles Stack ($10.50) and why I\'m here during my day off!! A hidden cafe located inside POMO mall. Waffles are the highlight here ~ Crispy crunchy waffles stacks with ice-creams ! Double up on happiness üòçüòç
I was so impressive of the latte art ~ reasonable price with big cup of coffee =] 
I am personally a fan of matcha! I have tried their red velvet and matcha waffles. My friends and I agreed that this waffles is the best in their sweet waffles section!
Here again and the waffles still don\'t disappoint. Light, fluffy, crispy chocolate waffle topped with ice cream and banana bits is definitely a sure-win combi. However, I remembered the bananas to be caramalized the previous time....... 
are you ready for sg50 weekend?!
It\'s time to pay a visit to a good ol\' Southern comfort classic, the fried chicken and waffles. The fried chicken patty was fatter than me after an all-you-can-eat buffet, and those waffles were just sweet enough to provide an interesting contrast to the savory, crispy fried chicken and joined in the crunch party that was happening in my mouth. The spicy slaw was the wildcard, smacking my tastebuds with a whole new dimension that made this dish legendary. The only problem with this dish is that the fried chicken is quite dry and stringy. Maybe you should pull it out of the fryer earlier eh Montana? After all, the poor chicken is already dead. Overall, it\'s an excellent dish, and well worth the $11.50.
This unassuming little glass of Cortado Cubano had me going \"ooh you\'re cute, you probably can\'t do much to keep me awake\". Well, it certainly smashed all my expectations as the rich, bitter brew gave my brain a hard kick, and the ever lovely condensed milk at the bottom of the glass gave me a good sugar rush. Thank you Cortado Cubano, now you have my eyes as wide as a cartoon character who just got suckered.
Generous portion of waffles and ice cream for price of only 10 dollars! Ice cream had rose tinged flavour too, unique /memorable :) 
Extremely crispy waffles with a taste that felt like bandung. Interesting presentation and layout, and omitting a quarter of the waffle yet selling at price similar to others. Very smart.
A thick lemongrass prawn patty topped with mango cubes &amp; red onion slaw. Drizzled with green curry mayo and sandwiched between two soft &amp; fluffy potato buns. The potato buns are baked in-house daily.
Red Velvet Waffle Stack - Beautifully stacked waffles that are crispy on the outside, fluffy inside. Sandwiched between the deep-red waffles are two scoops of vanilla bean ice-cream. A drizzle of white chocolate rose sauce &amp; a sprinkle of red velvet crumble completes this dessert.
because we harassed the burger and realized hey, burgers can look pretty without a top! red onions slaw and bright yellow mangos greeted us on lemongrass fused prawn patty slapped with green curry mayo. wish they finish this thai game stronger with a heavier punch to the sauce though. otherwise the novelty sake had people talking alright.
for the uninitiated, this spicy bacon pasta comes in 4 levels of mayhem.for the uninitiated too, is a lifestyle choice that i not partake spicy food. i took only ONE mouth of this maximum damage level 4 spiciness. death wish granted.
Al-dente spaghetti with bacon &amp; bird\'s eye chilli. Bird\'s eye chilli is a small chilli pepper with an intense &amp; fiery punch. At level 4, I was expecting a powerful hit of spiciness but it was actually manageable! The spiciness level was just right for us girls. No sweating, no tongue numbing effect, no need for water to extinguish the \"fire\" on our tongues. We approve!
sunday feeling edgy because monday edging in. coffee please!
u prolly know montana brew bar moons before me but did you know they now serve you burgers? like this umami burger with bonito flakes and miso shiitake mushrooms. a classic burger taste amidst the japanese flavor served on freshly in-house made soft fluffy potato buns which i thoroughly enjoy.
Recommended to pick the crispy and light waffle base aka \"The Big Crunch\". Yes, you can choose between two doners for waffles! The other is the fluffy and cakey base aka \"The Fluffy Souffl√©\", recommended for sweet ones.\n<br />.\n<br />Description by @kevin_the_hiak\n<br />.\n<br />Btw add me on Snapchat, username : weeatfish
Had spicy bacon pasta at level 3 (you can choose from 4 levels of spiciness) and I must say that I am impressed. Got kick! 
Truffle Egg Burger (SGD 15) - I loved the simplicity. Egg, beef patty, cheese and the aromatic black truffle oil that lingers from far. One of my fav burgers here.
How about this {Double Bacon Cheeseburger} for a treat?
The three signature burgers served at Montana Brew Bar which is from their newly-launched burger menu. My favourite goes to the Prawn Lemongrass Burger which pretty much stands out from the rest for its infusion for Thai flavours in the burger using ingredients such as a Lemongrass-infused Prawn patty and Green Curry Mayo which was hints a lot of curry spices alongside mango chutney and red onions, giving the burger a bit of zing. Umami Burger and Truffle &amp; Egg burger are both beef patty burgers; former was a light-tasting Japanese-inspired flavour with dried cuttlefish to provide the umami flavour while the latter was a crowd pleaser with egg and heavy truffle flavours that exudes the moment the burger is sliced apart. Burger buns are baked in-house daily to ensure freshness, and the potato rolls are made to be lighter than brioche so that the burgers does not get heavy on the palate.
Pretty interesting a dish it was because it came with customizable levels of spiciness so you can turn it up to take up the challenge of you are one who loves spicy food. Level 3 and this was rather spicy, with savoury flavours similar to belacan and haebeehiam within with bits of bacons to enhance those flavours. Because the levels are pretty distinct from each other, those who can take moderately spicy food should probably take up Level 1 or 2 first.
Woke up several times through the night to cough ‚Äì damn you, virus! ‚Äì but I\'m still hankering for ice cream and waffles.
nomnom I must say.
Homemade buns. 140g beef patty made from three parts of the cow for flavour and texture. Cheese. Bacon. Pretty good, though if the patty was better bound and less \"crumbly\", it\'d be even better.
Decent but patty overdone and a little lacking in natural flavours.
Okay, I exaggerate. LOL but really, don\'t mess with this dish as it has got 4 levels of üî•! (Or is it 5...) This Level 3 has a strong spicy after taste that\'ll have you reaching out for water... Definitely suitable for those who love your chilli üòè
It was a great combination of mushrooms and beef and cheese - truly full of umami! üëçüëçüëç\n<br />And because this is part of a newly launched menu, follow @montanabrewbar and get 10% off all burgers from 5pm onwards and 20% off for beers! Promo is valid till end of July.
Thai Lemongrass Prawn Burger is my favorite out of the 5 burgers. It has a thick crispy golden brown well seasoned prawn patty with distinctive aroma of lemongrass, sandwiched in between their in house baked buns with green curry mayo and mango red onion slaw. Mild spicy tasty green curry mayo definitely hits the spot, with the tanginess of the mango red onion slaw that work so well together in this tasty burger. And nothing accompanies a juicy, hearty burger like an ice-cold beer.
Tagged along with @shauneeie over the weekend for a tasting of Montana Brew Bar\'s five new burgers ‚Äì 3 beef, 1 chicken and our unanimous fave, the prawn.
One of the best waffle in town!

that generous portion of mushrooms coupled with melted cheese, patty and inhouse baked buns. I don\'t need to say more do I?
Glad that I picked the crispy waffle! Though the mac-n-cheese kinda screwed the texture in the middle, I was quite impressed with the unique fusion. I wish there were more grated parmesan (or any melted cheese!) on the waffle and more jalape√±o in the sauce. 
Please rain like this everyday thanks. |\n<br />|\n<br />Was sad that they removed their French Toast Waffles from their menu completelt though.
It\'s such a yoga/hippie trend to rave about chai latte, and while I\'ve always been intrigued (I love masala milk teas!) all the chais I\'ve had in Singapore were plain meh. The milk tends to overpower the spices, and spices also come across as punchy but disjointed. Even Kith Caf√©\'s version seemed disappointing. And don\'t even get me started on the ridiculously underwhelming at the self-professed chai specialist, Chaitime. UGH. 
Very unique waffles! It may seem like just normal waffles but it is actually stuffed with Mac n cheese. Also, truffle flakes (?) are sprinkled a top of it to give it a unique smell. It appeals to me because I like strongly flavored food and cheese. I would recommend it for any one who wants to try a savory kind of waffle as compared to the sweet ones. üëçüèº
we wanted to get the red velvet waffles but it was out of stock, we bought banana waffles instead. little did we know, it taste as good as a legit banana. definitely coming here again to try out their red velvet! 
Waffle texture was mushy. But this waffle smells really good. (3/5)
It\'s not too bad. Would prefer it without the condense milk at the side. It doesn\'t have the red velvet taste. But, it\'s overall is not bad. (3.5/5)
5 munchies: Thick and creamy artisanal vanilla ice cream sandwiched in light and crispy red velvet waffles. What stood out for me was the unique white chocolate sauce with a subtle hint of rose essence. This spectacular looking and tasting dish is sure to put a smile on your faces and leave the cafe with happy tummies.
Not to our liking cos this waffle is crispy both inside and outside. Prefer the fluffly waffle inside any time!
Let this Mac and cheese infused waffles be the one thing to try here! Crisp waffle went well with the texture of the macaroni. The fragrance of the slight truffle and cheese complemented the batter well. The jalape√±o didn\'t add much to the dish (not a fan of jalape√±o in general). Dip the waffle into the tangy and slightly spicy sauce for a whole new level of awesome!
Such a letdown. Buns used were so sub average you can tell there is no effort whatsoever. The cheese looks so glorious but the taste was extremely mild. Beef patty was average. Not recommended unless you\'re looking to just stuff your stomach with food.
I tried a level 4.5!
Pieces of fried chicken were as dry and tough as they look. Mayo went well with the waffles but the chicken was a real deal killer. Highly not recommended. 
($11.50) The aroma of truffle wafted into my nose immediately so I had pretty high expectations. It was decent, crispy outside and soft inside, a little mushy probably because of the incorporated Mac &amp; cheese. Could afford to be cheesier though so I can\'t imagine how version 1 was if this was supposedly cheesier. Their staff actually came by to ask if the food was ok so that was nice.
Actually liked this. Really strong cinnamon taste and much milkier than my usual chai tea lattes.
Located at POMO, Montana Brew Bar plays with waffles the unusual way. With flavors such as matcha and cinnamon apple, the truffle lover in me chose the Truffle Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese ($12.50) with a fluffy souffl√© base. The waffle was delicious, with an interesting take. Savory, this waffle comes with a Jalape√±o dip that is not spicy. With the waffle cut into quarters, the portion may seem small but do not underestimate it - it will fill your stomach to the brim. Do bring along a friend and share a waffle as it could be too filling for a person to have one alone! If you\'re looking to take gorgeous Instagram photos, here\'s a tip - sit near the middle, behind the wall with utensils, as having the black background can make your food pop!
Chose the fluffy souffl√© waffle which had a good consistency. Matcha taste wasn\'t that discernible, overall a pretty average waffle. The passion fruit sauce was refreshing when paired with the waffle. Wished there were more strawberries! The vanilla ice cream tasted very much like cardboard, which killed the dessert in every way. 
I love all things matcha, and this is no exception. The matcha taste will really mild though, and you can\'t really taste it if you eat it with the ice cream. The consistency of the waffle was great - it had the right amount of chewiness and fluffiness inside. If there\'s one thing this place gets right, it\'s their waffles. The ice cream was a little weird - it didn\'t taste like vanilla, or anything for that matter, and the strawberries could not be there and it wouldn\'t have made a difference. Good waffle, but lacking the wow factor as a whole. 
Quite disappointed with this dish. It looked really promising, and I was hoping for it to blow me away but it just let me down. While the waffles were done well, the chicken and slaw did not really live up to expectations. The chicken was dry, and didn\'t really taste like anything. The slaw given was quite sparse, so it didn\'t add anything much to the dish. Maybe cause I was subconsciously comparing it to Sin Lee\'s own chicken and waffles. Nevertheless, a little bit bummed out that this didn\'t taste so good.  
This is not the best burger around, and tasted pretty run-of-the-mill. The bun looked really round and fluffy, and it got me excited thinking that it was going to be crisp and buttery. However, it was just plain ol\' bread - nothing special. The beef patty was quite juicy, and the bacon gave it a good crunch. Taste-wise, nothing spectacular, and not really worth trying as there are better burgers out there. 
Was pretty impressed with this dish. The waffle had a crispy exterior, but remained soft and fluffy inside. It was probably partly due to the truffle mac and cheese inside. The truffle aroma was really strong, and gets your appetite going. However, I felt that it could have been stuffed with a bit more mac and cheese. Other than that, the waffle tasted delicious and savoury - not dry and tasteless at all. It came with a spicy and tangy jalape√±o sauce which helped to cut through the heaviness of this dish. Definitely a must try should you drop by. 
Most of us ordered the spicy bacon pasta (level 1 where the spiciness level was insane! üò±üò±) and it was served without the bacon while the rest of us ordered their herbed aglio olio and carbonara respectively. #montanabrewbar\n<br />#burpple \n<br />The main gripe here is that the portions were tiny - so much so that the whole group of us (6 ladies and 1 guy) still felt hungry after the meal ($9.90 incl a drink) and we had to buy more food after that.
Spicy Bacon Pasta (SGD $9.90) - You can choose from 4 different level of spiciness and this is a good spicy challenge for people who love spicy. A little extra kick is always a good thing! I had the level 4 which is the max, it was yummy and very SPICY!!! But I\'m totally enjoying this level and able to finish it without drinking any water! üòãüòãüòã For those who can\'t take spicy, is better to opt for level 1 or 2. You can order their waffles too after the meal because there is always room for dessert!
The famous but always nt available flavour in the stall..tasted Bandung thou 
The Mac and chz is \"injected\"inside the waffle making it easily eat and this version is nt so \"GAO\" 
How about a truffle Mac and cheese waffles? Can you spot the macaroni in the batter?üòã review of Montana Brew Bar up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio! Have fun while I jet off to another destination. ‚úàÔ∏è
I went there because of its \"Red Velvet Waffle\". It looked like a sandwich with ice cream in the middle. This waffle was really nice! It was crispy and taste good. There was a rose syrup which a plus for it. The second waffle was \"Southern Fried Chicken Wafflewich\". Basically, it was a sandwich, but they change the bread with waffle. It tasted good! The chicken was amazing, really.
Finally brought the boyfriend to try out their savory waffle cos he kept saying it looks very yummy! 1 more month to our 3rd anniversary! Hehehe! First and best boyfriend! Really grateful and blessed to have such a caring,loving,doting and tolerating boyfriend! üòò
Pretty generous, pretty filling. Guess it was a cool slaw that matches with it too. At least it\'s reasonably priced.
Most of us tried their BBQ chicken burger lunch set + 1 drink ($9.90)! Not too bad but I think their other waffle mains are better! #burpple #montanabrewbar
The cinnamon apple pie filings are beneath the ice cream. They have very interesting waffle combinations. Hopefully able to go back and try out more. (:

Opted for the chewier and softer waffle batter for this, probably would go for the crispy option the next time! 
Pretty reasonably priced &amp; crisp but the amount of colouring was pretty scary ($10.50)
(12.50) Amazing waffles! A bit disappointed that the Mac n\' Cheese didn\'t ooze out but the waffle had a strong truffle smell and the jalape√±o added a nice spicy kick. I had an iced coffee as well, nice but not very impressive. Hope to be back to try their other waffles and burgers!
Nice and full bodied. Cost $4.50. Nice and cosy place in town and great value considering this is town area.
10/10 for creativity, 7.5/10 for taste (got a little sick of it after awhile but luckily I was nearing the end of the dish) good to try once but will probably try the other menu items during the next trip!
Chose the fluffy chiffon base but it came out dense like cake and the 3 of us couldn\'t finish it üòÖ Waffles tasted like flowers to us too hahaha the Kickass Burger was pretty good though :)
üò≠ I chose the crispy waffle base which goes well with the crispy + moist fried chicken! I\'m drooling just thinking of this combination again.üòã Can\'t wait to feast once my wisdom tooth recovers!üò§
Having Montana Brew\'s Southern Fried Chicken again and just the way I like it; Drenched with maple syrup.
Montana is probably the first to incorporate Mac and cheese within their waffles - version 2.0 is now cheesier and more truffle! Dip them into the given jalape√±o sauce for an extra punch which gives you s.h.i.o.k. üôä Would suggest to consume it while it\'s hot, so take your food-fie fast ‚ò∫Ô∏è Review on, jacqsowhat.com (link in bio)
üíöüçìüëç I especially love how you can customize your waffle base @montanabrewbar! Opt for \'THE BIG CRUNCH\' for a crispy base or \'THE FLUFFY SOUFFL√â\' for a fluffy one!üòâ For sweet waffles I would recommend you to get the fluffy one while savoury goes better with crispy base!üòã
üôäüôà Why not when I feel just as satisfied or even more with them! üòå I like how @montanabrewbar is always open to feedback! They have since improved so much on their waffles from all the comments gathered. Good job on that!üëç Ps: follow @montanabrewbar and show this post to get 10% discount! üòä
Very good mac and cheese waffles here! They have other sweet waffles too
If you enjoy a crunchy waffle with really good ice cream, order it! Nuff said. (Limited quantities daily.)
These crisp &amp; cheesy Truffle Mac n Cheese waffles will be a good choice for #breakfast. Savoury waffles ftw.
Back here again with friends to try the other waffle creations. In general, we all preferred the savory waffles more than the sweet ones. The funny thing about this Green Tea Waffle is that it\'s taste drastically changes as you layer on more ingredients into your spoonful. Best way to eat it- 2 grids worth of waffle, a generous serving of vanilla ice cream and a dash of the mango syrup in the mango sphere. 
Green tea waffle w strawberries, mango passionfruit spheres, white choc sauce and topped w vanilla ice cream. You\'re able to choose your waffle base between big crunch or fluffy souffl√© kind. I\'ll be back earlier for the Red Velvet Waffle Stackkkk as it\'s limited per day. And TGIF! üéâ (p/s attracted weird stares while taking this shot üôàüò≥) #shootkahliao
I decided to head down to POMO to find out what\'s behind all these hype generated on social media.
Montana Brew Bar has been setting up the cafe hopping scene on fire with its fresh debut in Dhoby Ghaut\'s PoMo mall. Although a newbie in this industry, Montana has already been known for its delectable sweet and savoury waffles, and a hella good cup of coffee.
The apple pieces were nicely caramelised and went well with the vanilla ice cream. Best of all was the waffle - really crispy and yummy! üòã\n<br />Rarely do I visit a cafe more than twice (and in such a short time too) so this really soeaks volume about this place. The waffles here are indeed worth the hype and attention they\'ve been getting! üëç\n<br />#burpple
Montana is probably the first in Singapore to incorporate Truffle Mac &amp; cheese waffles, with Mac &amp; chesse stuffed within üòç $9.50 for this is absolutely a steal, go for this if you wanna \'level up\' your waffle fix. And for waffle base you are able to choose between crispy or the fluffy souffl√© kind. Once again, thank you @montanabrewbar for the kind invitation! (by looking at the coffee, you can see how long we took our photos üôä) #shootkahliao
The matcha waffle is well balanced with the bitterness of matcha and rose water white chocolate drizzle.
Waffles date with the coolest, sweetest, nicest people üòç and yummy food is the simplest blessing. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />[TRUFFLE JALAPE√ëO MAC &amp; CHEESE WAFFLE version 2.0 S$11.50] - truffle taste was just right, in crispy waffles, goes perfectly well with the tomato relish! \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />2 waffle base options - crispy and soft. I suggest crispy for savoury waffles! 
And this mac &amp; cheese waffle is something not to be missed. I would never expect it would taste that great until I tried, and now I\'m always craving for it!! üòã
The waffle base has been formulated to produce the crispest crunch you can ever imagine. It was so crunchy that you can hold and eat the wafflewich like a burger.
The type of sarnie that you can\'t eat with your bare hands, this formidable-looking creation has tasty fried chicken tucked between crisp waffles. Any greasiness is nullified with the sharpness of a wasabi slaw, while corn salsa on the side provides further refreshment for the palate.
Essentially a chocolate pound cake (!) with vanilla ice cream and sweet, gooey goreng pisang. The shift from fluffy chiffon to dense cake felt like a Lionhead Rabbit transforming into a Pitbull, and I\'m undecided if I prefer bunnies or puppies. The powdery bits were like salty, sticky hazelnut candy, and whilst they do provide the requisite crunch factor and may enliven a more bland-tasting canvas, the powder does not add much to the already strong chocolate presence here. Largely enjoyable if you just have a quadrant, but expect diminishing returns when less people share. 3.5/5 [Note: Sweet waffles at Montana Brew Bar now come in both crispy and fluffy versions - yes, the team is remarkably attuned to what the market wants and is always innovating and improving their formulas, and for that I give them serious kudos. Thank you for the invite!]
A tad dry for the chicken, but I heard it has improved many times since its launch. What really amaze me is their desire to improve upon feedbacks.
Those been there will probably agree after drooling over so many waffle posts recently.
Situated within POMO in the Dhoby Ghaut area, Montana Brew Bar is a cosy cafe that serves a variety of burgers, waffles, sandwiches, and pastries. They boast a rather extensive waffle selection that comprises both savoury and sweet. No visit is complete without trying their signature Truffle Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese 2.0 Waffle ($11.50) -- it\'s really quite shiok. For dessert, Montana offers a choice of either crispy or fluffy souffl√© waffle bases for all sweet waffles. Whichever your choice may be, indulge in their Matcha Strawberry Fields ($9.50) with mango passionfruit spheres and white chocolate sauce. On the coffee front, Montana offers artisanal coffee blends -- from single origin roasts to their own special house blend. 
Patty was nicely pink in the middle. We also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Wafflewich ($9.50). Waffle was light and fluffy and IMO better than Sin Lee. But I prefer Sin Lee\'s chicken.
The signature item from Montana Brew Bar isn\'t about subtlety - it targets your senses with militant urgency. The truffle missiles towards your nostrils from fifty metres away, the cheese within the waffle stinkbombs your mouth, and the dip whips the tip of your tongue with the loose end of its sari that it bought from North Bridge Road. The olfactory element is so dominant that the waffle - all cheesy, gooey-soft and gently spicy - almost feels like a submissive Anastasia Steele under its intoxicating spell. And just like Anastasia, I feel completely dominated and taken over, but it was a (well, stinky but) satisfying surrender. 4/5
2.5! You have heard it right, it is more cheesy and more delicious! Certainly better and leaves me craving for more!
With an improved menu, you can choose your waffle either the standard crispy or the new souffl√© based. Man, this is made for koko crunch/chocolate lovers. Sprinkled with nutella truffle powder.
The wasabi colesaw dressing is replaced with spicy southern mustard colesaw. A very refreshing change!I do find the fried chicken thigh a little dry and overcooked. Still, this is very affordable at $9.50 only!FOCUS on the waffles ok!! üòÇüòÇ\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />To my dear followers, like @montanabrewbar account and flash this post to get 10% off your bill!

Got invited to try out their improved recipes for their waffles. Version 3.0 differs from 2.0 with the chicken being marinated for a day in milk before frying, and the change from a Wasabi Slaw to a Southern Mustard Slaw. Must say that I like the slight char of the waffles, and the light and crisp batter so it doesn\'t get too overwhelming. The wetness of the slaw seems to get in the way of the fried chicken despite its slight spiciness, and the fried chicken somehow felt dry yet tender; a weird sensation. Didn\'t quite like the corn dip that came alongside too, which seem to add a weird tinge of sourness to the waffles. Preferred the Mac &amp; Cheese one any day.
Got invited to try their improved waffle recipes. Sweet Waffles now get a choice of different batters; one that is more souffl√©-like and the other which is crispy. This one was the former; I like the fluffiness of the waffles and there was a pretty evident dark chocolate flavour that exudes with each bite. Caramalised banana was soft and sweet, and the in-house vanilla ice-cream was smooth and creamy with its fragrance.
Got invited to try out their improved recipes. Version 2 of this waffle sees it with more jalape√±o, and cheese. That truffle aroma could still be smelt as soon as it\'s out of the kitchen, but this time round the waffles were fluffier and slightly more dense; no longer the crispy and crumbly ones we had on the first visit. Added cheese and jalape√±o meant that we could taste more savoury flavours now, and it also comes with a spicier kick. Tomato salsa at the side also comes thicker, zinger with a stronger punch of sweetness. Definitely better than before!
The Green Tea Strawberry Field Waffle is infused with a dense and marvellous matcha core within its crust. Impossible to resist!
Love the array of hues in this ensemble: an airy waffle tinged green from the infusion of matcha, decorated with ivory-coloured vanilla ice cream, molecular yellow blobs of passionfruit gel√©e, slices of crimson strawberries, and a finishing scatter of monochrome sesame seeds.
Detectable matcha, crispy, dense, and, it came \"plated\". My scoop of ice cream had a rosebud on it, the plate has all the swirly patterns, and of course, those four passionfruit spheres make up the most difference from any other waffles. It\'s trendy now that it\'s not just a waffle with a scoop of \"something\" on it, and I love it but just hope it wouldn\'t start costing us a few more extra bucks for such luxury.¬†(btw The Iced Mocha was $5.50. Bill was without GST)

üçµüçìThere are two kinds of waffle base options for us to choose from(YAY to more choices!!), starting from 24th Feb, which is only applicable to the sweet waffles. We had the fluffy souffle base for this. Good for sharing as it is pretty substantial and filling. The matcha taste is pretty mild, would prefer it to be stronger. Suggestion - The white chocolate sauce can be served on the side to keep the waffles crispy for a longer time.
The most creative waffle by far. I\'m not sure what was the chilli sauce made of but it went well with the waffle. Only they could expand the place a bit to accommodate more customers. 
A bit of the vanilla ice cream and some of those star berries complements that green tea flavor. You see the drizzle of sesame seeds as well? \n<br />if you\'re a fan of the thick and dense waffles, this would suit your palate perfectly. good to be shared for 4.
How about checking out their savoury mains as well such as the Kickass Montana Burger. That\'s the name of the burger, if you\'re wondering.
Now I know why the big hoo haa. It remained crispy and fragrant after about 35 minutes of photobombing + resting ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è. It tasted surprisingly light, with a strong truffle scent. If I want some proteins, I would order extra fried chicken and bacon to go with it. HAHA! üôäüôä Thank you @montanabrewbar for having us, and my inspiring grand master @ironsage for üçåüçå me!!
Chocolate, banana, salted caramel, ice cream- all my favourite things in one. Think this dish needs no introduction but seriously, it\'s worth every cent and calorie. Oh, one downside is that the waffles was reeking of the smell of truffles. I love truffle oil, but definitely not in my desserts!
After listening to people rave and rave and rave about this, I finally got down to trying it with my person. And it was sooooo good!!!! Crispy batter, fluffy and not overly cheesy insides, accompanied with the aromatic truffle smell....I\'m not a mac&amp;cheese person, but today I\'m sold!
Coffee Pour-over (drip) is arguably the simplest and cleanest way to draw out a coffee\'s best qualities. 
getting it right is no easy feat.
I like the combination of savory and the sweet (maple syrup). At $9.50, the price point is really quite reasonable as well.
Light and crisp waffle with a winning combination of truffle Mac and cheese, who can resist? Montana brew bar is back in the business today. You can get 10% off your total bill just by following them on Instagram and flashing this photo via Instagram at the cashier. Promo is valid today till next Friday 27th February 2015. Happy waffling!
Montana Brew Bar is known for their specialty coffee and waffles. Quite frankly, I would never expect a cafe that prides itself in their coffee to produce a cup of hot chocolate that will knock the ball right out of the park.
I spent my time blogging about @montanabrewbar while waiting for the steamboat to be ready, check it out on explodingbelly.com! Link up on bio!
Don\'t let these plain-looking waffles fool you ‚Äì their crisp exterior conceal a hearth of truffled macaroni &amp; cheese burrowed into their soft centres. It sounds terribly heavy, but the infusion of jalape√±os adds a healthy dose of heat to keep it from being so.
My virgin experience at Montana Brew Bar left a waffle sized hole in my heart. They say the way through a man\'s heart is through his stomach - oh boy how true that is.
#montanabrewbar
Not the flimsy bread you got me! üò´ Hahaha, no. I didn\'t have breakfast and I\'m just craving this before my midterm. üòø gotta head back for their red velvet waffle!
Not the most romantic place to be, but we left feeling massively satisfied.
It\'s a savoury afternoon accompanied by Southern Fried Chicken Waffles Sandwich with Wasabi Slaw ($9.50) and Truffle Jalape√±o Mac &amp; Cheese ($11.50). Special mention to the latter due the fragrant truffle and punch by the jalape√±o.
Lets have a cup of Mocha ($5.00) to start the day.
L‚ù§Ô∏èVE is in the air today, more so than any other day (as marketeers would like to have us believe). Don\'t forget to throw something sweet into your celebratory plans, like this chocolate waffle with salted caramel rivulets trickling down its sides and caramelised bananas and vanilla bean ice cream perched on top.
The waffle is quite intriguing - the fragrance of green tea lingers, but only a faint bitterness in the waffle explicitly betrays its matcha nature. The waffle has a crispy exterior and is warm and moist on the inside in manner of a mid-bake chiffon. Elsewhere, the mango passionfruit sphere rudely squirts its sweetness thus countering the waffle\'s bitterness, while the vanilla ice cream has the texture of milk shaved ice. Despite being a named lead, the strawberry just sits around in a high-slit cheongsam fanning itself without much interest in what\'s going on. 3.7/5
Pretty good waffles, coffee and tattooed hipster barista with awfully friendly good service, nuff said.
Strawberry field green tea waffle! :) the waffle was so crispy and was indeed green! It\'s my favourite waffle amongst all their offerings! The mango spheres are so cute and slightly sour and offsets the sweetness of the ice cream!
At just $9.50. It\'s a lot cheaper than other cafes! However it is also half a waffle that is sliced into half. The coleslaw and the chicken was nice too! :) reminded me of KFC original spice chicken
The taste was somehow a mix of savory and sweet... It is priced at $10.50. However, the place is quite small and i had to wait for 40 mins justs to get this so it was a bummer for me
Oh, the mac &amp; cheese were incorporated WITHIN the waffles. So as you take bites, you would find the inner layers soft and somewhat cheesy. I know this was carb in carb, but close your eyes to eat, and you might find this worth that extra run to burn the calories. * Readers of @DanielFoodDiary will get a 10% discount (till 12 Feb 2015). .

With a crispy exterior, this Truffle Mac &amp; cheese waffle is soft, fluffy and cheesy on the inside. It arrived looking unassuming but it was one of the best waffles I have had. All I can say is that I will definitely be back to Montana Brew Bar to try the other waffles on their menu!
Crispy, crispy and very crispy! Montana Brew Bar served up an awesome fried chicken waffle sandwich which was moist and tender, not forgetting crispy chicken skin! I was a little afraid of the wasabi slaw (not a wasabi fan) but the taste was not strong and it really complemented the dish~
The mango passionfruit spheres is very nice , break it to enjoy the zesty fruity burst of flavours. I like the black and white sesames complementing the matcha. Overall I thought there was too many flavours at play.
Surprisingly this turned out really really good, they got the balance spot on. Didn\'t know there is such thing as truffle powder too, Being a cheese person, inside me wishes for more cheese in the waffle. Overall it worth the calories.
(Yeah, we know.) The newly-opened Montana Brew Bar offers a selection of interesting waffles such as Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese and Red Velvet. This is their chocolate banana waffle with caramel and vanilla ice cream. Waffle away! Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Seth Lui #Burpple
Whoever thought of combining mac &amp; cheese, truffle and waffles must be a genius! This rendition of Mac &amp; Cheese is simply a crowd pleaser. Montana made it even better with their salsa sauce which strangely went well with it! However, there wasn\'t much truffle taste in the waffles I have to say but the picky eater hand model was satisfied üòè #burpple
Situated within POMO in the Dhoby Ghaut area, Montana Brew Bar serves a variety of burgers, waffles, sandwiches, and pastries. On the coffee front, Montana offers artisanal coffee blends -- from single origin roasts to their own special house blend. They boast a rather extensive waffle selection, both savoury (think Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese) and sweet (Waffle Suzette, Cinnamon Apple Pie, Strawberry Fields). Go for the Southern Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich and Red Velvet Waffle Stack! Prices are very reasonable.
The smell is quite strong but the taste is really good! Do try it if you are nearby! It\'s at pomo!
Loved the crisp outer and softer inner texture. The bananas were also suitably sweet (not over), and firm to the touch.
Yet another near school! The latte i got during my break was good enough to keep me awake for the rest of the lesson.
Exclusive brand new, we get to try it for the very first time!
On waffle madness today.
From the hot &amp; new Montana Brew Bar @MontanaBrewBar at POMO. \n<br />The waffle is agreeably crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, with a huge slab of chicken sandwiched in the middle. A steal at $9.50, so affordably priced.
Mac &amp; Cheese isn\'t what you really hear of with waffles everyday; that is why we decided to try it out. Waffles were crisp and buttery, but seemingly airy inside though probably because of the layer of Mac &amp; Cheese in between that can potentially make it overwhelming. Truffle scent was evident, and the whole waffle has no lack of cheesiness with full bits of macaroni in it, but it gets better with the tomato dip and the side which adds a tangy flavour that makes it pretty unique to its own.
For a new cafe, Montana Brew Bar not only does their latte art beautifully but also does a great smooth cuppa that had light acidic body and a nice chocolatey finish. Pretty decent and worth its price tag of $4.50.
You may be surprised to see a selection of wine, moscato and ciders in a coffee bar, and that\'s not just all. If you\'re hungry, breakfast items, salads, burgers, sandwiches and over 7 types of waffles can be found on the menu.
Random walk around city area and walk past a familiar place.. Sudden craving for some waffles with ice cream.. Back to one of my favorite cozy Caf√© for their famous red velvet waffles.. Super tempted to try their brunch but sadly I came too late (after 6 pm).. Anyway I tried their burger.. I was attracted to the ultimate Mac and cheese burger.. Beef patty sandwiched between 2 Mac n cheese \"bun\".. Quite interesting.. Beef patty a little overcooked as the meat outside is dry and little hard but inside is just nice.. Otherwise quite delicious and worth to try.. The chilli crab burger is quite normal.. Here comes my favorite waffles with strawberry ice cream to end my meal of the day.. Love the crispy outside, fluffy and moist inside \"feel\" waffles; paired with  the \"not too sweet\" strawberry ice cream.. Whoa, perfect match.. #montanasingapore #ultimatemacncheeseburger #chillicrabburger #redvelvetwaffles #burpple #favoritecafe #caloriesoverload #burningcaloriestomorrow #jaslynfoodinstagram
Brewed cocoa is something I didn‚Äôt know I needed in my life until a couple of hours ago when I went to @montanasingapore for dinner. 2. The waffle was soft and fluffy.

Potato puree that is blended till its incredibly smooth and bubbly.\n<br />You have to take your hat off to the Montana chefs for using the century egg with its strong and distinct flavour as one of the ingredients for the potato foam.\n<br />It pretty much adds another dimension to the overall taste of the potato foam that could otherwise be slightly bland

Spiked with a good bit of yuzu koshu for a seductive touch of heat.. these are good albeit a bit pricey for what they are (not 100% crab but definitely fresh since I found a sneaking piece of shell in my patty)

The coconut flavor is prominent between each mouthful and together with the coffee, I could taste faint hints of kahlua subtly seeping into my system... aww.
A smoky nutella freakcake.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Because I love all things chocolate. This was my favorite. Light soft sponge and richly smothered by dark chocolate. Lapsong su chong (black tea) was also infused with the nutella into the cake. Resulting in a little smoky finish and toned down the richness.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Made more fun to eat with the colorful choco buttons. But with anything and everything rich and sweet, best to share with others to avoid sugar coma.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Thank you Ying @chinesewinegal @montanasingapore for the invite. Kudos to you for reinventing the new menu and the launch of Anarchy Wine Bar.
Married with the coffee, it has a smooth caramel and nutty finish.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />A slight deviation from my usual flatwhite or latte, refreshing slurp on a hot day. \n<br />Thank you @tiara_star my lovely handmodel for such a dainty pose.

Coffee Coconut kaya with shaved coconut. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Best eaten with the shaved coconut to tone down the sweetness of the kaya. If you want something sweet and different from the usual waffles, give this a try.

The people behind Montana brings you these OTT cakes with the soft launch of their new space, Anarchy. Think 3 layers of dense sponge cake, carefully stacked, slathered with luscious buttercream, then topped with a shebang of sauces and candies. For now, their petite rendition of the much-instagrammed bespoke, towering cakes comes in 5 flavour combinations: Smoky Nutella, Matcha &amp; Black Sesame, Red Velvet, Kaya &amp; Coffee, Salted Caramel &amp; Cookie Butter. 
Burgers! These were alright... Not mind-blowing, but not terrible. Would consider coming back again.
Black sesame waffle with black sesame ice cream and lots of sesame seeds. \n<br />They offer a choice of crispy or fluffy waffle, the latter being soft and fluffy inside with a thin crispy crust. We liked that velvety texture of the waffle, and the subtle saltiness from the black miso caramel. \n<br />An awesome black dessert. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #chocolate #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #waffle

The waffles were not bad. Will definitely return for their black velvet waffle. The place is also relatively cozy. Nice place to relax at. Price wise, slightly pricey ($~20 per waffles after gst) but will return

It\'s very worth it, the burgers were big &amp; fries were a lot of many shapes!! Super good!! I couldn\'t even finish it, it was so overwhelming. The price of the sodas were expensive though, a can of sprite cost atleast $3.00+ so i recommend to buy outside drink.

Its evident So¬≠uth Bronx takes pride in their burgers. ¬≠Buns are baked fresh daily and each components, from the meat patties to the sa¬≠uces, are made in-house from scratch. W¬≠hat‚Äôs even better is the price point; S¬≠outh Bronx has kept their menu very affo¬≠rdable. Burgers go from $9.90-$12 and d¬≠essert burgers are no more than $6.90.

Have to emphasise that I enjoyed the red velvet bun so so much! It\'s a must try when you\'re at South Bronx!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />(This was a hosted tasting.)
An alternative to waffles!
This time we tried the Seafood Paella Waffle ($18) which comes with chorizo, prawn and corn salsa. Its labelled savoury but its more sweet than savoury. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #yummy #nommom #feedfeed #onthetable #food #sgfood #foodporn #latergram #foodgram #foodie #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #TSLmakan #singaporeinsiders #instafood_sg #igdaily #igers #igsg #8dayseat #whati8today

Located at POMO, South Bronx Singapore serves wholesome authentic burgers made from scratch. Their patties contains potato, and goes well with their self smoked bacon and homemade marinated beef. Simply delish &amp; worth every cent!
The refreshing kimchi coleslaw made the waffles less gelak and the Bulgogi Beef was seasoned well. My most favourite savoury waffle dish by far. ‚Ä¢\n<br />(This was a hosted tasting.)

Loving the new space + more food options!! From burgers at South Bronx, savory waffles at Montana, finish with desserts at fabulous dough üëåüèº
Signature juicy hand formed beef patty, gooey melted cheese, crunchy lettuce, secret house sauce, doughy potato burger buns, smoked bacon!
Awesomeeeeeee~\n<br />Clockwise direction from left is The Bronx ($9.90), Southern Fried Chicken ($10.90), and Lemongrass Prawn ($10.90). Favourite out of the 3 would be the latter, which is a very unique and delicious fusion of East meets West.

When I went it was 2 days old and they definitely needed to settle some operational kinks. Burgers were alright but could do with more flavour imo. Didn\'t try the  dessert burgers which had interesting flavours. Maybe next time.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #burger #fastfood #burpple

The salted caramel and Nutella one was a safe choice! Pretty cute concept but the donuts by itself were pretty average.

Featured here is Montana Singapore\'s Assam Crab Waffles ($18), made with a specialty blend of spices to deliver a truly unique Singaporean waffle. The waffles you get usually are plain and then topped with savoury or sweet waffles but here you have waffles infused with spices and while it might sound funny but i guarantee you its not. In fact its so delicious i was tempted to finish this all by myself! üòãüòãüòã i also really love the generous toppings of crab meat, which are really fresh, and the gula melaka mayo dip.

Well introducing possibly the world\'s first Coconut Cold Brews, Yuzu ($7.80) and Gula Melaka ($6.80), head on down to Montana Singapore if you would love to try this awesome combi. The Yuzu boost a slightly citrusy taste that bonds well with the coffee and coconut juice and the Gula Melaka is sweet and syrupy.\n<br />I like how the people at Montana actually determine your taste profile by asking a series of short questions and then recommend a drink based on our preferences, which was why we decided to go for these 2 drinks. I feel like you can expect a customized dining experience but at affordable price points üëçüëç\n<br />#cafes #cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #yummy #nommom #feedfeed #onthetable #food #sgfood #foodporn #latergram #foodgram #foodie #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #TSLmakan #singaporeinsiders #instafood_sg #igdaily #igers #igsg #8dayseat

I don\'t mean no harm. Hope you understand. ‚õà || ~ meanwhile, {Assam Crab Waffle} to spice up the afternoon. Wash it down with @YendaBeer pale ale (that shit is good üç∫) ... Inspired by Malaysian Kedah Assam laksa; this proves a tad different from the usually coconut saturated versions we have locally. Galangal and lemongrass perfumes the sweetish crabmeat mixture whilst the pineapple salsa adds a touch of acidity to the mix.

I love penne as it\'s one of the easiest pasta to eat, just spoon or fork each penne. No need for messy twirling of spaghetti noodles.

Sporting a cooler, more muted grey facade, the menu has seen a similarly chic facelift with adjustments to variety of pasta and waffles and with that, an expected increase in the price foray. || yet, the Mac &amp; Cheese waffle from the previous menu remains steadfast; delivering punches of heat and gooey Mac and cheese amidst a crunchy golden brown hide.

A cold brew....coffee and the white round sphere is actually fresh coconut juice that was frozen. 1st sip, tasted abit sour then as it goes down...it becomes bitter. When the sphere melts, that is when the sweetness greets u at the end. But one have to be patient cos it takes awhile for the sphere to melt.

Black sesame with black miso caramel and black chocolate (abit of charcoal powder added) coated vanilla ice cream. Sesame seeds strewn all over. It was not overly sesame-ey and the sweetness comes from the vanilla ice cream.

Especially chocolate flavoured ones with Nutella and bananas. Perfect combi, you know, the metal cable to cable cars way. #socorny #songstuckinmyhead #montanabrewbar #burpple

What\'s better than having jalape√±os,  mac and cheese on your waffles? \n<br />#MontanaBrewBar #MBB #Pomo #Burpple #WhatDineshEats
I need some caffeine.

Other than the price being ridiculous ($12.50) üò§ the melded flavors were great.

softer) or Crispy Waffles for the sweet ones. of cos, we had the Crispy option but guess what? it came out even softer than the savoury waffles we had! the only saving grace for this was the fact that it does taste chocolatey. well...well. @igsg #igsg @montanabrewbar #foodpornasia #singapore #setheats #burpple
I think it\'s good for one-time try to see what the hype is all about. I mean, \'good\' to a person isn\'t necessarily the same for another, right? @igsg #igsg #singapore @montanabrewbar #foodpornasia #setheats #burpple
Don\'t have apple neber mind. Got Cinnamon Apple Pi(e) Waffles lagi better!
Mwahahaha! How different can it be... Located in a nondescript shopping center along the Parklane stretch, the brew actually refers to the brewing of coffee lah. Was skeptical at first, thinking okay luh another faddish cafe/waffle place has open but... After trying the waffles hor, I\'m totally sold. And I said, Montana come take all my money! Lol!
üòÄ‚ú®‚òïÔ∏è
Oh so good ! And that Jalape√±o sauce...üòã‚ú®üëå Rating : 4.75/5 .
Was thinking why not turn the tables and try this out in cafes instead.
üòã My favorite gotta be the Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese Waffles üç¥
the coffee here\'s not too acidic which I happen to like but there could be a tad too much milk. \n<br />review on montana up on ma blog ‚òùÔ∏è
Crisp on the exterior and fluffy soft insides with lots of cheese! \n<br />Can\'t wait to go back for more of Montana Brew Bar\'s waffles!
Great awsome üëçüëçüëçüòÑüòÑüòÑ
Surprisingly, it was their sweet renditions, rather than savoury, that spoke to me.
goodbye weekends.
But these Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese waffles are so deceptively good!\n<br /> #vscocam #vsco #burpple

I need to try the red velvet waffles, neeeeeeeed!!
Life\'s too short for denial.
if you\'re lucky, you can even see a reflection on your cuppa.
Now upgraded to the latest operating cheesy system and enhanced truffle software. It was good to begin with, so it\'s just better now, and also backward compatible with ver 2.x and ver 1.0 ... No more patches required, only need a body reboot before trying it again as our plate was finished in minutes. As it stands, it has a lifetime warranty :)\n<br />#macandcheese #waffles #truffle #muchimproved #ver3 #sgfood #montanabrewbar #food #foodgasm #FoodPorn #burpple
Back at Montana for their Southern Fried Chicken Waffle
Smooth, bold, aromatic, creamy......
Here is one of the new cafe, check it out on my blog.

Beyond the walls of those crispy #waffle walls is a delectable combination of flavours. #Truffle #MacAndCheese with #jalapeno. Who woulda thunk! @leezld couldn\'t stop raving at how good they are.
#sg50shadesofgrey
Special mention to the latter due the fragrant truffle and punch by the jalape√±o.

2 of my greatest love - Coffee &amp; Waffles. 
Really love the waffles here üòçüëç\n<br />#burpple
Truffle Mac n cheese waffles, green tea waffles and chicken with waffles! All delicious waffles at just $9.50 NETT each. I highly recommend the green tea waffles! Which was the crispest waffle and the mango spheres were so fantastically awesome. 
Damn these crispy thingums are soooo good! @khjpyc1405 no wonder I had to wait for a table!!! Too yums! ;)
yum yums... üòãüòã
You are suppose to hold it and eat like a sandwich. üëçüëçüëç
Virgin trip here and was recommended with these 2 waffles!\n<br />1. The southern waffle sandwitch with fried chicken was really hearty and savoury! Everything tasted like a fried chicken burger that wasnt overly oily, making it a light and enjoyable munch tho falling slightly behind sin lee.\n<br />2.The waffle suzette was novel and decent! Waffles were really crispy and the addition of the oranges and compote gave a really sweet and fruity burst to every bite! Worth a try if u wan something uNIC.üòâ\n<br />#sgfood #burrple #cafehopping #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igfoodies #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #vscocam #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgig #whati8today
Very crispy plus the mac and cheese is hidden inside! The Waffle Breakfast BLT behind is equally yummy too üòãüòç\n<br />#burpple
Back for the second time this week (as a student studying nearby, i thank you guys) and today i wanted something with a stronger kick. Well-balanced and just what i needed to wind down for the week. Edit: kudos to the attentive barista who collected feedback on the coffee and got me a glass of water (i didn\'t request for it)!
Loved the crispy texture of the waffle and the combination of a salsa-like sauce with guacamole and egg ! The corn side dish was also refreshing and a great appetiser ! Still at the soft launch stage, they did a check back at our table for feedback which was excellent service ! Hope they can keep up with the good food and service as they face more competition with the many new cafes sprouting up all over sg ! #blt #waffles #brunch #breakfast #breakie #brekkie #brunchtime #aftergym #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodie #noms #foodlover #delicious #foodporn #foodgasm #eatoutsg #whati8today #sgcafe #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #food #burpple #foodtography #foodshare #montanabrewbar #foodpics #eat #instafoodsg
