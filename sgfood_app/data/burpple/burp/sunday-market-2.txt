This block of thick cinnamon sweet brioche is stuffed with custard, served alongside with their signature Thai milk tea ice cream. Pretty good, though we felt that the matcha green tea custard spread on the plate didn\'t quite work out. 🍞
Some friends are like the truffles to my fries, they goes well together and you will never get bored of them.

The waffles was really crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The proportion is great for afternoon tea and the cafe is perfect for small gatherings with friends. The selection of ice cream includes Thai milk tea, raspberry &amp; passion fruit. 
👍🏻👍🏻Churros Amigo $8.90｛churros with gula Melaka sauce and vanilla bean Icecream} 😋😋 #churros 
Its basically pancakes with duck meat embedded in them, topped with hoisin sauce. Sounds like a weird combination but wow I was pleasantly surprised! The pancake is like the carbo of this dish (think duck rice). The meat makes the pancake less \'gelat\'. Also tried the beef rendang lasagne, which I felt was too salty. ~\n<br />One more day to the weekends!! Looking forward to more good food this weekendddd (diet starts next week HAHA)

I thought the brunch should be tasty because many ppl here. But not surprised me, taste fair. Sausage and ham like NTUC one, salmon egg not taste well, but coffee is nice. Maybe I should order the Bangkok toast, next time can try again. 
Seems like weirdest combination but surprisingly good! \n<br />The light crisp on the exterior reminds me of churros (esp. with the cinnamon sugar), while the interior was really soft and eggy. \n<br />Cut abit of the toast and spread some matcha custard, the custard was light and had a consistent smooth texture. Afterwards, scoop some cold thai ice milk tea ice cream into your mouth to an amazing contrast party in your mouth experience. TBH, the thai ice milk tea ice cream was really good! It\'s milky and have a well balanced strong thai tea taste! \n<br />Thank you #sundaymarketsg for letting us have our last last last order despite closing the kitchen! 🙌🙌🙌
The classic French toast is spiced up with an Asian twist at Sunday Market. The Bangkok Toast ($10.90) is a thick and fluffy block of sweet cinnamon brioche toast, pan-fried and caramelised, then served with a matcha custard and a side of Thai milk tea ice cream. The cold ice cream is a great compliment to the warm toast, and the Japanese and Thai flavours work surprisingly well together. In the event you have leftover ice cream, you can always drink up the rest as Thai iced tea!
Not too bad but could be better if their toast is less burnt and ice-cream is not so melted. Toast is really interesting thou. However, the waiting time is really too long, I lost all my momentum on the food. #burpple
The duck was fall-off-the-bone tender and well-marinated. The orange sauce went really well with the roasted potatoes and sautéed mushrooms, and really brought the whole dish together.The salad was nothing special to talk about. However, with the myriad of duck confits being offered out there now, this doesn\'t really do anything to stand out amongst the crowd. 
Humongous pancakes chock-full of chocolate chips topped with fresh fruit and chocolate sauce. What is there not to like. I really liked the pancake consistency here - it was not just soft and spongy throughout, which can make it come off a little cakey which I personally do it like. The outer layer was slightly crispy with some crunchy bits that I really liked since it gave it a more interesting texture. The pancake taste was also pretty good, not just bland like most, and despite the huge amount of toppings still managed to hold its weight. Good for sharing with a couple of friends, though you may not want to after a bite or two. 
By Sunday Market at the 9MCM popup which is on from 20 to 21 Jun 2015. Lasagne seemed a tad oily doused in chili oil, and while it did carry a mild slickness it was rather salty and hard to finish.
The toast was really thick and fluffy, and the matcha green tea custard was really refreshing. The Thai milk tea ice cream was extremely satisfying.
While the beef rendang was flavourful, the lasagne was a little dry and we wished there was more of the rendang in this dish. 
Two perfectly poached eggs, accompanied with cream of spinach and sautéed mushrooms atop a thick slice of buttered toast, drizzled generously with hollandaise sauce. I really like that you could actually taste the hollandaise, which was rich and creamy and had me swiping at the plate for more. Although it seems like there\'s a lot going on, it wasn\'t too heavy, and is quite the perfect portion. Impressed with this place which was super crowded; will definitely be back to try more!
Local food with a cafe twist! May have ordered too much for two to share, but both the service and food were great.
They did it with cheese sauce and mayonnaise, topped with some shredded seaweed and bonito flakes. Enough for a Japanese twist?
Although the waffle here was a let down, the ice cream thankfully made up for it - Chendol &amp; Thai Milk Tea.🍦Yea I bought a pint of ice cream home after this 🙊
Like a massive sweet potato fry bear-hugging a fluffy doughnut. 3.7/5
Look at the scoops of ice cream sitting so prettily on that 4×6 sized waffle!! Before the waffles arrived, we could already smell the delicious aroma of buttermilk wafting through the air and my dad commented that it smelt really fragrant, which only made my tummy rumble more. The presentation of the waffle was simple, nothing too fancy or shabby. The bright purple of the Kyoho Grape provided a nice contrast to the light brown of the waffle. I sampled each ice cream separately before diving into the waffle itself.
The former tasted exactly like a creamy grape Yakult whilst the latter was mildly crispy on the outside and rather bread-like and tough on the inside, resisting the knifing with as much stubbornness as a gruff Encik from SISPEC. 3.3/5
The famous Bangkok Toast from Sunday Market surely didn\'t disappoint. The thick French Toast was nicely soaked in an egg mixture, pan-fried and topped off with a nice Caramalized coating. Also loved the Thai iced tea ice cream on the side, which melts into Thai iced tea by the end of the meal, offering two times the treat. Not sure what\'s that green paste thing but it didn\'t taste  much anyway. I felt that the Bangkok Toast came off as more of 3 desserts on one plate, as there were little synergy among the various components. But hey, 3 desserts for the price of $10.90 is not too bad right? 
Eggs were done nicely, but would prefer more cheese on the eggs. This place is tucked at a corner near NEX and is perfect if you are looking for a quiet cafe during the weekend. Will be back to try the Bangkok Toast and also their coffees
sunday market has a nice ambience, and isn\'t very crowded :-) food wise, the tom yam pasta was slightly hard, the rendang lasagne was quite nice though! we had their chocolate (which was richer than i expected) and sea salt caramel ice cream as well
($10.90), Cinnamon thick sweet brioche toast with Matcha a Green Tea custard, served with Thai milk tea ice cream.
($12.90), Scrambled eggs with smoked salmon &amp; cream cheese served on a buttered toast with grilled tomatoes &amp; tomato marmalade.
The Tom yam noodles tasted similar to those Maggie Mee kind but the texture was still pretty acceptable. However, the prawns doesn\'t seem to be fully cooked despite the chef claiming so. Won\'t be coming back for food in awhile.
Thai milk tea ice wam with match sauce to match with the thick and fluffy toast, it was a good substitute for after you (but after you is still the best)
Somehow not as yummy as I remembered it to be. The sides are kind of dry. Hmm..
Got this #FriedChicken with #Waffles. The seasoning on the chicken was fantastic BUT I think they forgot to serve our maple drizzle. Hence the dish was a bit dry. Looking at the menu again now, I realize this was supposed to come with some maple syrup! Oh wells, still very #tasty nonetheless! Will come back for more!
Nicely decorated environment, friendly staff, but weak air conditioning - making the cafe very stuffy. Ordered eggs Benedict and \'Christian Gray\' salad. Eggs Benedict took 30min and 2 reminders before it arrived, and the salad was just Tuna Salad. Overall disappointing experience. 
Dare to try something different? How does fried chicken on waffle sounds to you? $11.90++
Roasted Duck with Garlic Hoisin Crispy Egg Pancakes | Fried Chicken Waffle | Spaghetti Beef Bolognese
🍴 We had Smoked Salmon &amp; Cheese as well. As you can see, the scramble eggs were 😪. But I must say the matcha latte &amp; cakes is pretty good here 👌
Here\'s Crispy Fried Chicken on Waffle. Unfortunately, the chicken I had weren\'t fully cooked while I was cutting it. Staff apologized and offered me a replacement, but uncooked meat is totally unacceptable. 😪
A quirky fusion of flavors. Smoky salmon with buttery avocado topped with rich yet light cream cheese ice cream. Waffle is crisp at the edges while a lil dense and not too fluffy. A clever and creative of ingredients within one dish. Try it for an experience while the taste is still doable for it. 
Yes, the highly raved Bangkok toast from #sundaymarket! Review on the place up on fatassbean.wordpress.com

The bread pudding inside the otherwise bland and dry toast was heavenly! Matcha purée just tasted sweet, perhaps overpowered by everything else. The Thai milk tea ice cream was a good dipping sauce for the toast, and you can drink the leftover melted ice cream from the cup when you\'re done! I would think it\'s quite pricey at $10.90.
Nice flavours though the meat is a little too lean and tough for me
How about some snack then? Skinny Wings and Truffle Fries @sundaymarketsg
the different components came together really well! the milk tea ice cream was to die for
Fluffy and moist within. Matcha custard and Thai milk tea ice cream at the side. Overall, the combination turns out well 🍰
Love the combination of asian flavours. This was a really decadent dessert to end off our meal :)) | ★★★★★
One of the signature items at this cafe and it didn\'t disappoint! The pancakes were fluffy and contained quite a generous amount of duck meat | ★★★★☆
$14.90. Mixed seafood in chili oil, seafood broth, garlic, chili, crispy fish flakes &amp; chopped parsley. This was really good! I enjoyed the addition of crispy fish flakes which added a different texture element to the spaghetti dish. Portion was a little small though. Amount of pasta was probably two-third of a normal serving. 
A tad bit dry but the Thai milk tea ice cream was YUM! #sundaymarket
The pancakes were DELISH and the combination was really unique and I loved it!! #sundaymarket
Cinnamon brioche toast with Matcha Puree and Thai Milk Tea icecream. Interesting match. The cinnamon toast itself is quite nice. But the Matcha Puree and Thai Milk Tea icecream can be a little stronger in taste. 
Their thai milk tea ice cream and matcha custard really goes well together with the hot toast.
Thanks for the cupcakes! 😚 @sophiensyy
Don\'t be fooled by it\'s appearance. Using your fork to poke through the middle, you will find its treasure of the matcha ice cream sitting on the black sesame sponge cake. Localized flavour but rich for the soul. 
Brioche with cream cheese oozing out the the cinnamon sugar coated toast, with matcha custard cream accompanied by Thai milk tea ice cream, no wonder this calls for their dessert name. Presentable and delightful!
Who says you can\'t put smoked salmon in between a waffle and a scoop of cream cheese ice cream? The combination spells sumptuous, with a balance in the flavour of the smoked salmon together with the waffle and the ice cream. Must try!
The chicken is tender and delectable! It is perfectly paired with the French toast and the sunny side up. Order yours today!
Comes with yummy side salad, the smoked salmon sandwich is a big portion and it leaves you feeling full and brigs a smile to your face for a hearty meal. Only at Sunday Market :)
This is Sunday Market\'s signature roast duck pancakes dish! Unique aspect of this dish is that the roast duck is within the pancakes! It is flavour full but not too overwhelming. Double thumbs up for recommendation!
Marinated fried chicken with crispy waffles. $12.90 per portion, value for money and delicious!
Fluffy Bangkok toast within w alight custard filling. Goes well w the matcha paste and Thai milk tea ice cream! 
Homemade Thai milk tea sealed in a glass bottle. Interesting concept yet rich in flavour. Is a must try for Sunday market!
Taste not bad but not worth my money to have it again.. 😯😯
Everything about this place is geared towards hip factor! Think the serving &amp; kitchen crews are rather overwhelmed by the number of customers.
Duck pancakes, rendang brioche toast and chicken french toast. #brunch #sundaymarket
Perfect crunchy toast on the outside n soft on the inside. Alongside with milk tea ice cream (which tastes exactly like their Milk Tea Thai).
Loving the buttered toast! The meat could\'ve been more tender though. Kinda over-cooked a little so it\'s a little tough. 
There\'s something about waffles that I cannot resist and must order whenever I see it on the menu. Ordered my waffle with a scoop of yuzu sherbet (outsourced). There\'s still room for improvements for the waffles 😅 
To be honest blended coffee is bad but this creative combi waffle did surprise us.  Chic place to chill
A nice place to chill out on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I love the decor, music and feel of the whole place! The food was nice, and it was about $50 for 2 mains, a side and 2 drinks, though it was quite a wait for the food. I\'d recommend the duck pancake ($12.90) which was pretty good. Will be back to try out the Bangkok Toast!
Love the Skinny Wings. ..bangkok Toast is Yummy. ..thai Milk Tea Ice cream My Fave
Well done French brioche toast; crispy exterior with fluffy interior filled with custard cream! Comes with matcha cream sauce &amp; Thai milk tea gelato 👍😍
This is a really nicely done dessert! The toast is crispy on the outside and a surprise awaits on cutting it open!
Unique twist to the beef and the toast was super yummy! Great new place!
the big breakfast served here along lim tua tow is all too similar to everywhere else.  the contrasting difference would be its brioche! soft fluffy and tasty. goes real well with those ozzing egg yolks. happy a good brekkie y\'all!  and happy midweek
fried prawns sticks to top it off, stir fried in some laksa flavoured sauce. 🙏🙏
Probably the most interesting sweet  dish I\'ve had for a long time. sugar burnt toast with tenderly soft filling coupled with thai ice tea flavoured ice cream. 👍👍 highly recommended
Recommended, Burnt sugar toast with Thai Ice tea flavoured ice cream 👍#brunch #weekend #cafesg
Quiet cafe which has a menu designed around sweets. Waffle was slightly bland and soggy, not something you\'ll expect out fresh from the waffle maker
Burppler Andy likes Sunday Market for it\'s quiet and cosy ambience, and recommends the Bangkok toast with Thai milk tea ice cream. This gorgeous new space in the middle of Serangoon and Kovan MRT also features an array of unique ice cream flavors, great coffee, roasted duck pancakes, yum ;) Better visit before this place gets too popular..
I am truly thankful for all the efforts put in for my birthday. Something simple, nothing very extravagant,  yet the tots behind everything weighted so so much. Thank you peeps, I have a blast!
Sunday Market is a relatively new cafe which took over \"The Factory\" who used to be famous for their fries and signature dips. The photo may not look mouthwatering but I really love this dish! Pancakes with roasted duck in garlic hoisin sauce with rocket leaves and egg white crisp ($12.90) the combination was very unique and refreshing! Being an all day breakfast person, I\'ve never come across something like this, they do serve the usual stuff like eggs Benedict ($12.90), truffle scrambled eggs tartine ($10.90) as well. However this is their signature dish. The pancake was a little more on the buttery side, you could taste the buttermilk and those who don\'t like \"rich\" stuff may find it too gelat after eating. They were generous with the duck fillings and the sauce made it really flavorful. I\'ll be back to try their eggs Benny! Oh and their brunch items are available all day!
I don\'t really take beef, my partner had this and love it. The meat chunks were tender and I love the toast! The texture was really good. Their second recommended dish ($15.90) apart from my duck pancake :)
Mango ice cream with coconut sago ,white chocolate and lime zest And lemongrass 
Savoury pancakes with roasted duck, mixed cress and drizzle of garlic hoisin
This creme brulee cheesecake is sweet but not too much even after the 5th mouth. Interesting plates and utensils!
Plated dessert at Sunday Market, a week-old cafe taking over the former premises of The Factory. Mango Ice-Cream speckled with chili flakes, lime-lemon esquina, coconut bits, digestive biscuits and white chocolate, this sends the tastebuds to a joyride of sweet, sour and spiciness in all different extremes.
A savoury pancake dish from Sunday Market; a week-old cafe that takes up the former premises of The Factory. Probably a fusion dish inspired by Peking Roast Duck as it contains fragrant buttermilk pancakes with roast duck within the batter for savoury goodness. The fluffy and crispy fried egg whites adds on a different dimension of texture, while the salad is refreshing to the almost-too-salty dish due to the Garlic Hoisin Sauce
Coffee from Sunday Market, taking over the former premises of The Factory which uses a blend of Robusta and Arabica beans.
The ambience in this cafe is really good, comfortable seats, well spread out tables and really friendly servers. Furthermore, the price range of the food items are affordable and nothing cost beyond 20 dollars. :) .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sundaymarket #throwback #latergram #cafe #cafefood #waffles #fries #trufflefries #foodie #foodstagram #foodporn #foodpath #fooddiary #foodblog #foodblogger #foodjournal #jiakpahliao #tiamjiak #ieatishootipost #hungrygowhere #hungryman #hungersolved #foodporn #burpple #burpplesg

It\'s Thai milk tea w ice cream is not really sweet (&amp; I like it this way). Pretty good combination with the cinnamon toast, mixed berries &amp; matcha green tea custard! 😍
Crunchy prawns are the best ones! 😍😋

OF COS I HAD TO TRY IT! unfortunately I didn\'t like it (except for the ice cream). perhaps it was too un-crispy? maybe it wasn\'t tasty enough? to be honest, I couldn\'t really tell it was Gula Melaka either (just a little, probably) who knows though, some of you may just like it! @sundaymarketsg \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie #sundaymarketsg #dessert #churros #gulamelaka #icecream

Loving the tomyum spags 
Felt so disappointed with this dish. Tasteless pancakes coupled with dry shredded pulled duck in between. The taste came solely from the garlic hoisin sauce that was drizzled all over.

Anyone on the prowl for good churros would want to check this one out. Unlike traditional churros, the the churros are already drenched in caramel sauce so no dipping is required. You, however, wouldn\'t need to worry about it getting soggy because they will probably disappear in a blink of an eye. The churros are mad crunchy, and are fried to golden crispy perfection. Surprisingly, I didn\'t find this too sweet despite the caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream combo. One of the best around, definitely should try!!

Was alright.. Still prefer crispy waffles. 
An awesome campsite, bond over brunch, any day of d week (:
Sweet, sour, spicy, tangy and crunchy all at once. Glorious and memorable. 4.5/5
Food was slightly disappointing. Duck confit was a little tough. 
Looks ang moh, tastes Chinese
Chicken Waffles, Eggs Benedict, French Toast with Roasted Chicken 😋
Good ambience and good food!

Salmon waffles with cheese ice cream. Sweet and savory but the waffle could do with a better texture.
So this time I brought my mama back to try the other dishes and we weren\'t disappointed! Lovely duck confit, salmon with waffles and bbq chicken with french toast!
Not my favourite dish but a good change from the usual.
It\'s not too sweet and with a bit of strawberry taste 😉. Felt the waffles was too starchy though. Nonetheless, enjoyed my night there. Especially with awesome company 😙💜 || #simplyweixinfooddiary #somehashtagsoutsidethedoor - #nomnom #dessert #getinmybelly #icecream #foodoftheday #cafehopping \n<br />Oh!
