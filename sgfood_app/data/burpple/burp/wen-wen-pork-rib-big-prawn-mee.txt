Been trying to get my colleagues to come to mah hood and this finally made it happen!\n<br />Note that this super duper uhmayzing hotpot is not on the menu and that you should call the friendly uncle (Richard, 98492125) at least a day beforehand to reserve.
Eating at this unassuming prawn mee stall in Geylang Bahru Market and Food Centre is the kind of experience that will leave a lasting impression on you and your friends. The signboard only speaks of prawn mee and pig innards soup, but you should look for the owner, Richard, and ask for the Prawn and Seafood Hot Pot ($50 for two pax, $60 for four and $80 for six). Like most hawker centres, the seats here are fixed so its best to occupy a table for four, and you can share one pot ($60) comfortably. Expect fresh prawns, clams, pig intestines, pig tails, pork ribs and crabs bubbling away in a naturally sweetened prawn broth. The best part is ‚Äî Richard allows you to bring your own vegetables! Add cabbage and mushrooms to the mix, and if you like, he recommends shabu meat to swish in the broth. The service is impeccable and there\'s free flow of soup and carbs for the ravenous ‚Äî choose from white rice, yellow noodles, bee hoon or kway teow. &#x2028;It can get really warm eating this in a hawker centre, but it\'s truly well worth the sweat.\n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person \n<br />Photo by Burppler Raine Liu
Accompanied with dry prawn mee and given the fact that you are allowed to bring your own vegetables and mushrooms to Âä†Êñô(add ingredients) at no extra cost!! This pot of ‰ªÄÈ∫ºÈÉΩÊúâ(everything also have) cost us $60 (best shared among 4 people), please call ahead at 9849 2125 (Richard) to order with the boss!
The amazing-looking Burpple reviews had me scooting off to faraway Geylang Bahru for this prawn and seafood hotpot, which I\'m glad I did because we were blown away by the depth of flavours in the soup. It was light and refreshing, yet at the same time, you can clearly taste the natural sweetness and saltiness from the fresh seafood lingering around. Plus, it gets even better over boiling! Ingredients in it are fresh prawns, lala and crabs, pig intestines, pig tail and pork ribs. Feel free to let the uncle know if there\'s anything you don\'t eat and bring along your own ingredients to add on! Yay to more enoki mushrooms! üëÖüí¶ (Prices of the hotpot varies based on no. of pax)  
They usually sell Prawn Mee. But you can request for this awesome hotpot with crab and all! The uncle is super friendly and you are encourage to bring your own ingredients to add to the hotpot. (Rating:üòç)
Seafood galore (prawns, crab, clams) plus pork ribs, pig tails and intestines üòå this upsized prawn mee broth is good (too much even!) for four people. If you\'re a big eater, bring your own hotpot ingredients (as encouraged by the super friendly uncle). But don\'t underestimate this, especially since the goodies in the pot seem to never end and the intense broth and rice/noodles are free flow. 
That\'s not the actual name, it\'s just what happens when you go out with Dad and he gets stuff that\'s not really on the menu. üòÇ
They serve good and fresh seafood. They sell Prawn Mee, Crab Mee, Pork Rib Mee, Abalone Mee, La La, Pig tail and Pig Skin. They also serve seafood pot with plenty of ingredients in it as shown in the picture. Seafood lovers what are you waiting for ?! It\'s a MUST TRY! You can contact Uncle Richard Sng aka AH Huat at 98492125 to make reservation for seafood pot üëçüèΩDo also take note of their operation timing: TUE-SUN 12pm -2pm and 5.30pm to 10pm CLOSED on MON

How about upping the ante further by using the broth that was used to serve with their prawn noodles to make it into a steamboat but added with more prawns, pork ribs, a whole crab (only for the bigger portion) and clams? An absolute genius of the stallowner to improvise and create a prawn soup steamboat.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Did I mention that you can also bring more ingredients from outside and add it in by yourself? We actually bought salmon slices, chicken fillet, mushrooms, vegetables, sweetcorn and white radish to add into the steamboat, making the entire experience a wholesome one.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Wen Wen Big Prawn Mee\n<br />Address: 51, Old Airport Road, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Unit 01-147, Singapore 390051 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock #burpplebestchinese #steamboat
Can you imagine the excitement on our faces when we found that free-flow prawn mee steamboat actually exists?! At $50 for 2 pax, there\'s a huge variety of ingredients from sweet prawns to pork ribs and even a whole crab in the mix. But if you find that it\'s not enough, us Singaporeans will be glad to hear that we\'re also allowed to bring in our own ingredients from the nearby supermarket too! .\n<br />Read the full review at http://eatbook.sg/prawn-mee-steamboat/\n<br />.\n<br />Wen Wen Pork Rib Big Prawn Mee\n<br />Address: 69 Geylang Bahru, #01-2747, Geylang Bahru Market &amp; Food Centre, Singapore 330069 (Relocating to Old Airport Road on 1 November 2016)\n<br />Operating Hours: Tuesday to Sunday 11:30am to 2pm, 5:30pm to 9pm\n<br />.\n<br />Writer / Video talent: @hotcheekylace\n<br />Videographer: @marktankai
What do you do when you sell regular Big Prawn Noodles, Pork Ribs Noodle, Pig\'s Tail Noodles, Crab Noodles, Pig\'s Intestine etc??? The next big step would then naturally be to serve all of the above as a Seafood Pot!!! Chunky pieces of crabs, big prawns, succulent pipis, nice clean chewy pig skin, intestine, tail &amp; ribs incredibly served in a pot filled with prawn\'s broth!!! Lethal combination you simply can\'t stop - well at least for me ;p This is probably the next leap for hawker fare in Singapore. Definitely worth a try despite the price tag of $50, $80 and $100 bucks for a pot. Yumminess 4/5 üëçüëçüëçüëç
