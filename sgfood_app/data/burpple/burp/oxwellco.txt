This gastropub is so British, you\'d mysteriously adopt a Cheryl Cole accent and go all \"you dodgy wanker go bugger ooooooooff!!! are you so knackered you have gone and lost the plot? you\'re to-ally rubbish mate\" by the end of the potently Ginny night.
Back: Crispy rolled kurobuta pork belly\n<br />Served with a side of Brussels sprouts. ☺️👌🏻 Wising everyone a great Christmas Eve with your love ones! 😌💕
☺️💕Raspberry Trifle to share with everyone!😁 This is @OxwellCo\'s take of the traditional English dessert. Looks neater and more presentable on the table? 😉 Like the look, Oxwell &amp; Co\'s version tasted more cake-like too! This dessert is part of the \'Fabulous Festive Menu\' that has been rolled out for this Christmas! Read more about it #ontheblog!😊 #oxwellandco
😌 This is the orange and ginger cake, part of the \'fabulous festive menu\' that @OxwellCo is offering this Christmas! Served with a side of as humongous chocolate ice cream! You\'re definitely in for a treat.😎👍🏻
Food was great and so was the ambience! Highly recommended if you\'re all into anything English. ☺️☺️☺️ .\n<br />This is the sinfully good slow-roast rolled kurobuta pork belly, one of the main dishes that is available on #oxwellandco\'s Xmas special menu! 😋👍🏻
lovin how each grain bit is seasoned perfectly yet juicy at the bite.
Cozy British setting over good food.\n<br />Starters and appetisers already looked so good!\n<br />————\n<br />Thanks @oxwellco for having us and the very nice @thesilverchef for the invite! 😜
I would kill for a drink now. Gin Basil Smash from Singapore Cocktail Week\'s Hendricks popup at Oxwell &amp; Co. Refreshing but heavy handed with the lime concentrate.
Mid-day beers are always the best! Headed to Oxwell &amp; tried their beers on tap &amp; bottled! Reasonably priced, Oxwell carries a unique range of beer! Definitely worth to head there to try the others! 
Nestled among the rows of double-storey shop houses lie a restaurant which serves excellent English food. The menu is simple, small and thoughtfully curated. My friend and I ordered roasted pork belly and roasted chicken, both with the same condiments of mashed potato and root vegetables. The Brit chef mistaken our order and served us pan-seared salmon instead of the roasted pork. However, he was extremely generous to have the roasted pork on the house for us (extra mashed potato points for graciousness!) and quickly whipped up the salmon. All 3 dishes were equally delightful: from the soft tender pork, to the crispy skin and juicy meat of the chicken, to the fish seared to perfection and the smooth mousse-like mashed potato. We also tried the lemon poussin, a classic British dessert and it was very refreshing! This restaurant changes their menu daily, so we know where to head to if we want to get an English fix! 🇬🇧
And im not just talking about the food. Truffled mac and cheese with lobster #pescatarian #foodporn #glutface
Worth every carb laden bite. Best bread and butter I\'ve eaten outside of Europe #foodporn #glutface #love
The food here is not bad! It may look small but it\'s actually very filling. Although a couple of stuff that I wanted to try wasn\'t on the menu. Think they change their menu frequently? 
Trying their well loved piña colada. With coconut meringue on top of coconut cream with rum, pineapple and lime
Strawberry Eton Mess. Doesn\'t look like much, but this really was a faultless combination of crispy pavlova chunks and tart strawbies cloaked in cloud-light whipped cream. #etonmess #cream #strawberries #sweet #dessert #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
28 Day Aged Porterhouse Steak with Japanese Wheat Beer Battered Onions. Juicy, perfectly seasoned meat that was let down by blunt dinner knives - where were the steak knives?! Loved the ultralight and crispy onion rings, though! #beef #steak #onionrings #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
Oxwell &amp; Co Prawn Cocktail. One of my faves of the day - perfectly cooked prawns in Thousand Island dressing. #prawns #seafood #salad #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Popcorn Mussels. Crazy good - I could pop these light battered mussels all night! #mussels #shellfish #barbites #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Smashed meringue with cream and strawberries. Such a good mess. An unassumingly great dessert. Definitely for cream lovers!
Perfectly medium rare porterhouse steak with the crispest, lightest onion rings ever. A great dish.

The {150-day dry aged Bone-in Prime Rib} from Australian farm Nippon Ham is perfectly medium rare red in the middle with a hide of heavily peppered crust. Too good with lashings of gravy and those Brussel sprouts tossed in maple butter and smoked lardons as distraction

Tonight\'s {Lemon Posset} turned several heads at the table - akin to eating a lemon curd but slightly lightened by cream
Topped with a coconut meringue please.

the meat was perfectly roasted, tender at every bite unlike your usual roast.
.\n<br />Part of the Christmas feast set at @OxwellCo; this orange scented pound cake perforated with bits of candied ginger provides a lavish albeit jerlat finish to a great communal feast of epic meat proportions. Served with a fresh berry compote and cream, this was so up my alley that I snuck in two slices despite my exploding belly. Guilty.\n<br />.\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #oxwellandco #christmascake #cakecakecake #igsg #singaporeinsiders #sipandgulp #sgfoodies
yes Christmas has come early and @oxwellco will be having this gem of a dish on their christmas menu.
// Super addictive and it\'s heavy spices definitely making up for its very basic origins。\n<br />。\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #singaporeinsiders #igsg #sipandgulp #oxwellandco #hungrygowhere #8dayseat
Having this really interesting #pinacolada with #meringue on top! Yum! #cocktails
This is the brilliantest of them all and despite the darkened looks, it\'s the taste of That duck flesh that has me enraptured like a baby well fed and slept. Sweet, juicy, moist, tender doesn\'t just capture how i felt bout this fat bird, it\'s smoky aroma is the proverbial icing on the duck. And then some :)\n<br />#challandduck #roastduck #oxwellandco #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodporn #burpple

- Copious amount of wines and a communal dinner from start to finish，complete with pork scratchings and {Salmon Gravlax} as starters and mains such as whole roasted challand duck and a crazy crispy rolled kurobuta pork belly to complete the entire experience。\n<br />。\n<br />So Happy。
