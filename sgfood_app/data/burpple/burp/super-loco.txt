Situated at Robertson Quay, Lucha Loco\'s laidback sister outlet, promises you and your friends great Mexican food, and even better Margaritas. This spot is perpetually packed, so if you\'re going in a big group, be sure to make reservations. Order a jug of frozen Margarita ($59) to get things going, before going for the Elotes ($8), Mexican grilled corn on the cob slathered with chipotle mayo and dusted with cotija. You won\'t be able to stop munching on the Totopos with salsa and guacamole ($12). Throw all caution to the wind and order a variety of tacos ($5 - 6 for a single serving), and quesdillas ($14 - 16) to share. Don\'t miss the Huarache ($12), a grilled masa base that\'s akin to a thicker corn tortilla, topped with flavourful, juicy grilled chicken, mushrooms and queso fresco. Note that Super Loco requires groups of 12 or more for their set menu that comprises both individual and sharing plates!
Yesterday\'s Mexican situation. Love everything about Super Loco ‚Äì the food, the decor, the location, the colours... Yeah, Super Loco is a super way to start the day, any day.
Classic breakfast dishes, like the Eggs Benedict, are given a Mexican street food twist. What you get is Super Loco\'s unique brunch menu. A most satisfying meal to end off the week #nofilter
Pretty spicy with a generous serving of pulled pork. A hearty meal to fill the stomach of 1 hungry person or the stomachs of 2 not so hungry girls. 
Sixty-six levels of wow. The acai itself was gorgeously gelato-esque in texture, there was just so friggin‚Äô much going on within the massive bowl ‚Äì from the crispy burnt rice feels of the quinoa to the sweet and sour mango chunks ‚Äì and the best part of it is that unlike many other commercial acai bowls, this legitimately feels like the equivalent of giving your health and internal systems a big, fat, wet purple kiss. 4.5/5 
Sweetcorn is inherently a savoury artist with ambitions to cross over into the sweet market, and the salted caramel and sugary seeds helped satisfy that bi-industrial curiosity. 3.7/5 
Essentially hawker carrot cake with added corn kernels, served with a generous portion of cooked salmon and loads of other strong smelling and flavoured friends. 3.8/5 
The pork carnitas was tasty, spicy and refreshingly not diced pork cubes-esque as similar pork products can be, while the chipotle hollandaise was manageably light. The poached eggs, however, had yolks that can charitably be compared to ginko nuts in texture. 3.7/5 
experiencing something different for our normal brunch.
Super Churros ($12) - Mexican Churros dusted with cinnamon and served with orange chocolate and mezcal (berries) sauce. The churros were so good that it\'s now on my list of go-to places for churros! 
Going Mexican for brunch üá≤üáΩ‚òÄÔ∏èüç≥üçÑüçûüçìüçπ The Big Mexican ($25) Free-range sunny side up eggs, Toasted Sourdough, Avocado, Roasted Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Mexican Beans and Bacon. Loved that glass of Strawberry and Cucumber Aqua Fresca. A healthier option compared to coffee and refreshing as well.
Tired of the usual brunch items? Super Loco is an interesting twist with Mexican-inspired brunch items. For the meat lovers, the hearty breakfast burrito chock full of juicy steak slices and scrambled eggs will surely satisfy you. The pulled pork torta is another item worth ordering as well! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Definitely worth the trip down here with amazing ambience, food &amp; friendly staff! üòå Happy Saturday yall!
It\'s things like this that keep me in love with #wearesuperloco #burpple
This is a fresh and natural tasting, less sugary version of your old school sweet corn ice cream from the ice cream truck with a lightly salted caramel drizzled on popcorn. If nobody grew fat, I could eat this forever. #burpple #wearesuperloco
If you\'re sick of the usual English muffin with your eggs benny, then this is for you. The Super Rancheros comes with free-range eggs served on corn tortilla with ham and cheese in between plus a fresh tomato salsa on the side and of course, baconnn! The Tortas (Mexican sandwiches, from $14) are rather underwhelming so I suggest you opt for the Breakfast Burrito ($18) instead stuffed with scrambled eggs, strips of steak, Mexican beans, salsa rojo and pico de gallo. 
Just a couple more hours until the weekend officially begins. Meanwhile, I\'m dreaming of these cinnamon sugar-dusted Mexican dough fritters with orange chocolate sauce ‚Äì this latter this spiked with mezcal for a tinge of alcohol because, why not?
The weekend brunch at super loco is awesome ...  We ordered the Huevos Rancheros &amp; Super Rancheros ... Which consists of two Sunny side up served with on a corn tortilla with Mexican beans, creama and tomato salas, ham&amp; bacons
So good you can cry. These babies are grilled to tender perfection and smothered in a thin layer of mayo, chili, and cojita cheese. Sounds deceptively simple, but that\'s where street food always stumps you, right? Comforting, slightly messy and downright satisfying, this is the best start to a meal.
Instead of having the usual cafe eggs Benedict or big breakfast etc, this colourful restaurant serves up brunch during the weekends. I had the sweet corn fritters with guacamole, free range eggs and sour cream while my friend had the Super Racheros, which consists of corn tortilla with eggs, bacon, ham, tomato salsa and cheese. We also had their super smoothies, and boy are they really superb and healthy too! I enjoyed the pear and rhubarb one, a slightly unusual pairing which flavours are robust and slightly sour, yum! After which, we had their Super Churros (not pictured)  and I kid you not, they\'re one of the best I\'ve tasted- light and fluffy without the greasy aftertaste. I\'ve tried the dinner menu before and their selections are delicious! I\'ll be back for more salsa! üíÉ
Decided to go a little different this time round with our brunch. We went Mexican~ üíÉ bff and I ordered one course each and woah boy, the taste of the dishes were really good and I really enjoyed it a lot. Bff always say I\'m a picky eater and i managed to finish the entire plate, leaving it super clean. What I have to mention is that the ambience is really nice which makes dining even better than before! Affordable &amp; decent Mexican food that you all should give it a try!
Slightly under the radar for brunch is Super Loco, Lucha Loco\'s sister outlet. It makes perfect sense to enjoy your weekends here. Just imagine a tequila or mezcal cocktail in hand, washing down a table of Mexican food while enjoying the picturesque Roberston Quay. Start with the Esquites ($8) ‚Äî grilled corn on the cob coated with mayonnaise, cotija cheese and chilli ‚Äî a typical Mexican street food. The Breakfast Burrito ($18) is stuffed with steak, scrambled eggs, Mexican beans and caramelised onions, and is perfect for ravenous people. They also have tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and more common dishes like avocado toast and pancakes. Go for the guava and blood orange margarita ($16) if you can\'t decide on a drink!
Super Sunday guaranteed with Super Loco\'s Super Rancheros ‚Äì two layers of soft tortilla sandwiching a surprise filling of ham and gooey cheese, with impeccably cooked sunny-side-ups, crispy bacon and sour cream piled on top. This ranks as probably the most satisfying brekkie dish I\'ve ever had.
Just a matter of hours standing between me and the weekend. So looking forward to it, but what I\'m anticipating even more is a return trip to Super Loco for their Super Weekend Brunch menu.
Super Loco\'s super Mexican weekend brunch. Probably one of the best brunch destinations in Singapore ‚Äì idyllic location, smashing non-typical breakfast food. I\'m in love!
Welcome the weekend by making brunch plans at Super Loco! Set against a backdrop of Robertson Quay, Super Loco is an idyllic spot dressed in an eye-catching array of colours‚Äîyou won‚Äôt miss their bright teal bar counter and wooden furniture accented with splashes of fuchsia and orange. Just being in that environment makes us feel happy already. Read our full review on GourmetAdventures.net!
A colorfully themed atmosphere along the riverside, great place for brunch. Eggs glorious eggs....food was goooood! 
Thumbs up for its tasteful brunch. I\'ve found my new go-to brunch place :) 
Coffee by Allpress was a good start thou temperature a little cool . The big breakfast was stack with lots of thing. The sausages were a welcome surprise as well as the Mexican beans. Bacon was crisp but not feel it hot enough. Will be back as great location for casual a brunch. 
Sister outlet of Lucha Loco, Super Loco gives us all another chance to go loco for great tacos at Robertson Quay. Their menu is made up of favourites from Lucha Loco, as well as dishes unique to Super Loco. Do yourself a big favour by ordering their signature Elotes - a bite of their delicious Mexican grilled corn will change your life. This place has a great buzz, making it a superb spot for fun group nights out. Tacos, elotes, grilled meats, churros and cocktails; really... what more do you need? Go hungry, you\'d need the space.
Fun Mexican food place with addictive corn chips! 
Mucho Mojito: Mount Gay Eclipse Rum, Lime &amp; Mint. Mexican Mule: Don Julio Reposado Tequila, Ginger, Fresh Lime Juice &amp; Ginger Beer. Guerro Punch: Don Julio Reposado Tequila, Pineapple Juice, Fresh Lime Juice, Cardamom &amp; a dash of Mezcal.

Sunday brunch at Super Loco!
The fried chicken wings tossed in a chipotle sauce and drizzled with lime crema and pickled jalapenos were so finger licking good. Even though my mind was telling myself that I am stuffed, I could not resist going back for more of it. This is one dish I would return for.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #superlocosg #chickenwing
With chorizo
Ouch. Each one was like $5
It is then finished with olive oil and lime juice. I enjoyed the sourish kick of the dish with the fresh snapper but best to eat it together with the nacho for a more balanced experience.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #mango #snapper #ceviche #mexicanfood
