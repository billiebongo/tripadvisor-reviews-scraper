Warm dishes to conclude this amazing experience. Sampo rice, braised tuna jaw (which I loveeeed), holy trinity and foie gras with braised mellow. .\n<br />|\n<br />Personal favorite will be their sampo rice which involved hands on skill. Wrapped the seaweed into a cone and place the mixed rice into it. .\n<br />|\n<br />Lastly their braised tuna jaw was just pure comfort. Happiness in the mouth and soul.
All started with an invite from @burpple, I was converted to their regular. I brought my friends and my friends brought their all kampong. .\n<br />|\n<br />Starting with a few cold dishes, their raw oyster with roe was so addictive. Their flavors pounded the palate but retreated with an ocean-t sweetness. .\n<br />|\n<br />Depended on the season, chef fabio would display his awesome knife skill by filleting halfbeak. Halfbeak was a cousin of sliver fish, so getting it so fresh for Sashimi required a lot of know-how. .\n<br />|\n<br />Just by their Sashimi set itself, it was already worth half its cost. Melted in the mouth tuna and incredible umi. .\n<br />|\n<br />They deep fried the prawn and halfbeak bone and served as snack. Nothing go to waste! .\n<br />|\n<br />***Hidden menu which must be pre-order.
Armed with both skills and passion, Chef Fabio, owner of Yoda Japanese Dining, has been in the Japanese Fine Dining scene for over 30 years. Hence, the veteran chef definitely knows good tuna when he sees one.
Something I would never have ordered or tried otherwise, Yoda Japanese Dining’s Sanbo Rice might have just blown my mind. Off their omakase and available on selected days when they have all the fresh premium ingredients, the Sanbo Rice ($30) was really really good. Not a fan of sea urchin, I was pleasantly surprised by the simple combination of sushi rice, cut up tuna belly, seaweed and salmon roe yet having the distinct flavours just worked wondrously as one. Giving the items in the bowl a good mix and wrapping them up in the seaweed, you will also be greeted with different textures in each mouthful and the taste of the ocean (i can’t find better words to describe). 
Get their Omakase experience (priced at $100) and be transported to tuna heaven. Served with freshly grated wasabi, we had a slice of Akami (known for its leanness and deeply red vividness), Kanpachi, Otoro (fattiest part of the fish) and Chutoro (medium fatty, lovely bite). Each one with its own unique flavour according to their fat content, it was certainly a great introduction for a sashimi beginner like myself.
Kick things off with their Sashimi / Tuna Salad ($18) with a refreshing and tangy yuzu-chilli shoyu dressing. Amping up your usual greens, the thickly cut Blue Fin Tuna from Nagasaki was so guud and the savoury tobiko was the icing on the cake. The slight kick from the dressing also enhanced the freshness of the fish and pulled all the elements together.
🍙\n<br />•\n<br />How do one eat this wonderful of a creation? \n<br />1. Firstly, you mix the rice &amp; ingredients together.\n<br />2. Secondly, you take a spoonful of mixed ingredients &amp; wrap it with a piece of seaweed Nori (海苔) with wasabi (ワサビ).\n<br />3. It\'ll look like a mini hand roll then enjoy! 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Yes there\'s set meals in the menu like; Bento, Sushi, Nabe, Grill, Donburi, Sashimi &amp; many more. 🏵\n<br />However I Recommend you to get the Omakase (💵S$100) its more worth it \"leave it to Chef Fabio\" he\'ll personally create a meal for you. 🖖🏻
🍣\n<br />•\n<br />The story of how the potato chips came about:\n<br />\"I don\'t fancy flying fish roe on my California roll.\" An expat commented. 👱🏻\n<br />At that specific time Chef Fabio was munching on potato chips &amp; he reckon that it will be a good substitute as both are crunchy &amp; salty. \"Wow! This is the best California roll I\'ve had!\" 😋 \n<br />Although I\'m more of a Sushi Purist myself, once in awhile it\'s good to try innovative sushi. 🎏\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Yoda is a All-in-one Japanese Dinning Restaurant. Fresh seafood &amp; meat imported from Japan twice a week with best seasonal produce that you can buy. With Teppanyaki, Yakiniku, Nabe &amp; Sushi offerings &amp; helming it is Chef Fabio with 30 years of Japanese Cuisine Experience. 🖖🏻
🍗\n<br />Cook to its optimum temperature, the rack of lamb doesn\'t have the \"lamb smell\" that some fear. It\'s called the Rolls Royce Cut for a reason. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: \"Why Hungarian Mangalica pork?\" Well, first of all, the flavour is unbeatable. It’s the Kobe beef of pork. Its free range &amp; the meat is well marbled. Basically it\'s pork royalty. 🖖🏻
🍣\n<br />•\n<br />Just like any other Aburi Salmon Mentai Roll you expect the same taste but it\'s a little different here. Chef Fabio mixes the Mentaiko &amp; Flying Fish Roe together which is interesting &amp; the portion is generous. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Most of the Japanese places I go, I\'d always order their Omakase because I Trust the Chef, that he will specially curate the menu for you with the freshest produce. Call Yoda Japanese Dinning a day or two earlier for reservation, tell them you want the Omakase (💵S$100), show up &amp; let Chef Fabio surprise you. 🖖🏻
🍲\n<br />•\n<br />The winter melon is soft, juicy &amp; soaks up the umami soup like a sponge. The seared Foie Gras provides a wonderful melt in your mouth not in your spoon sensation (Yes, that much needed Duck Fat Liver) \n<br />Eat all the components in the dish together for the ultimate quite pleasurable experience I\'d say. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Skip all the seats in the restaurant &amp; go for the counter seats, then order the Omakase. 🏵 \n<br />You will learn how to appreciate &amp; love counter seats where one can cinematically watch Chef Fabio prepares your food &amp; take the dish together with your senses especially your palate unto new heights &amp; possibly unexplored territory with seasonal fresh produce. Umami baby umami. 🖖🏻
Accompanied by a slice of Kanpachi (間八) greater amberjack. 🐟\n<br />Clean, Fresh &amp; oh sweet Mother of Mary the melt in your mouth Chūtoro &amp; Ōtoro. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Chef Fabio the Owner &amp; Chef of Yoda, imports an entire Wild Blue Fin Tuna caught in Nagasaki about 50kg worth thousands of dollars for his sashimi. 🎏\n<br />That by itself is saying a lot about him, freshness is of paramount. PS: There is live Tuna Cutting event held at the restaurant, follow &amp; like their social media page for more info! 🖖🏻
Taking a break from the more common makis, Yoda Japanese Dining’s Aburi Salmon Mentai Roll ($18) gives a playful spin to the much loved mentai sushi rolls. Prompted by the bag of chips he was having at that time, Chef Fabio, owner and head chef at Yoda drew inspiration for the roll after the request of a customer to replace the tobiko on his California roll. Hence, imagine a deep fried salmon-crabstick roll tucked in the middle wrapped in rice and seaweed, after which topped with sashimi-grade salmon, slathered with mentai sauce and crowned with potato chip crumbs (YES, POTATO CHIPS!). Torched to create that creaminess and smokey fragrance, the roll was a nice explosion of flavours and textures - all salty, sweet, crisp and soft. And just like their sushi, Yoda Japanese Dining offers other innovative dishes and aims to bring different concepts all rolled into one.
🥗\n<br />•\n<br />The dressing is made in-house using Yuzu extract accompanied with a hint of Chilli for that extra kick which awakens your taste buds for what\'s to come. 🏵 \n<br />Generous thick cuts of Fresh Blue Fin Tuna with Crunchy garden greens kicked of the meal well with much anticipation for the other courses to come. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: \'Yoda\' which means in Hebrew \"one who knows\" was the inspiration for the restaurant. If you know, you know, &amp; I want you to know this place because it is worth knowing. 🖖🏻
Negitoro, salmon roes, uni — mix it into the sushi rice before wrapping it with the seaweed. A bite sized delight as you bite into the sweetness of the chopped tuna belly and those ikura bursts ✨
Freshness is important when it comes to sashimi and I\'m glad these from Yoda Japanese Dining didn\'t disappoint! Featuring a selection of maguro, chutoro, otoro (tuna are from a 50kg bluefin tuna from Nagasaki) and not forgetting a piece of kanpachi.
Many have the perception that the fresher it is, the better. But the magic of Aging &amp; curing actually enhances the flavour making it more refine &amp; funky. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #YodaJapaneseDining #omakase #蟹 #Crab, #FoieGras #フォアグラ #Daikon #大根 #omakase #お任せ #おいしい
🍣\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: This assorted Sashimi Platter alone is worth at least a quarter of the Omakase &amp; what\'s better is that this is just 1 out of the 10 dishes we had. So Good, it\'s blasphemy. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />You start from the Otoro, then Chutoro &amp; work your way to the Botan Ebi Shrimp but leave the head for later as Chef Fabio will Deep Fry it &amp; turn it into something much more wonderful than the best Calbee Flavour you can find. That need a dedicated post by itself. 🦐\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #YodaJapaneseDining #omakase #sashimi #botanebi #shrimp #otoro #chotoro #kanpachi
Like wow, this restaurant is a hidden gem nestled in the heart of Viva Business Park, Chai Chee area. Still don\'t know where? 🗺 It\'s where Decathlon Bedok is located. \n<br />Anyhooos...I chose this set due to my love for Unagi and Sashimi! The sashimi slices were really fresh, sweet and value for money. The Unagi? Tender, juicy and bursting with goodness in every bite! The Chawanmushi was delightfully smooth although it lacked the usual prawns and ginkgo nuts that I adore. Overall I give this a 5/5 for the food! Totally value for money and I would definitely visit again! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 #burpplesushimonth #yodasushi #japanesedining #japanesefood #cafehopping Tagging my #dontfollowmeto peeps and @eeggaannn so we can have OMAKASE dinner if I win this #Burpple contest!
I remember not trying this in Japan cos it was just way too expensive! So i was damn excited when this was served at Yoda! -\n<br />-\n<br />And japanese fruits are just so juicy and good! 2 slices here and 1 of it has a shot of Yamazaki18 poured over it, never knew melon goes so well with whisky! 🥃 😍\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #onthetable #sgeats #jiaklocal #burpple #chef #japanesefood #eathealthy #sgdinner #fruit #melon #yamazaki #whiskey #whisky
