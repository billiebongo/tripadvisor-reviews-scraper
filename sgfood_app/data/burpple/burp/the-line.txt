I wasn\'t expecting this when I planned for a buffet dinner at The Line. It was just coincidentally that they were celebrating halloween and the whole restaurant was decorated with a halloween theme from the stations to even staffs wear wearing halloween makeups and costumes. Staffs were very interactive and there\'s even groups of kids walking around tables asking for treats. I have my fun and enjoyable dining experience at The Line.
A very appealing spread of freshly cut sashimi is waiting for me. This is the very first time where I have seen good presentation of sashimi, making use of the remaining fish skeleton. It just attracts me to it.
You can be the nice person to treat and also peel all the #lobster for your love ones at The Line\'s revamped Sunday Champagne Brunch at @shangrilasg.
Still in a food coma post Sunday champagne lunch at @shangrilasg The Line. Gosh the revamped spread is amazing with more seafood, sashimi, and meats. Highlight for me is the foie gras (8 types!!) and cheese (30 types 😁), and the chocolate sweets!! Of course the free flow @perrierjouet bubbly. 💗💗💗
From super fragrant to \'stink to the high heavens\'. From old world to the new world cheese. Take your pick. At The Line, @shangrilasg\'s #SundayChampagneBrunch
13 types of fresh seafood on ice for the Sunday Champagne Brunch.
Today\'s @PerrierJouet Grand Brut at #TheLine #ShangriLaSG.\n<br />•\n<br />Shangri-La Hotel Singapore has a new Chef de Cuisine Vincent Wong and we\'re enjoying our Sunday with The Line\'s updated Sunday Champagne Brunch. Highlights includes a refreshed selection of seafood (13 types), 30 varieties of cheeses and a carving station featuring six roasts, and lots more!
Look at the \'human\' behind walking. It\'s bigger than the man\'s chest. #wagyu #shangrilaSG #champagneSundayBrunch
HUGE 48-hour slow-roasted #Wagyu Beef Leg  for the picking at the #ShangriLaSG #TheLine #buffet spread. They\'ve also got tomahawk, ribeye, lamb, and other meats! 😍\n<br />•\n<br />Just part of the updated Sunday Champagne Brunch at The Line - $158/pax with unlimited #PerrierJouet Grand Brut and other beverages.
It was #foiegras heaven over at #ShangriLaSG #TheLine - 8 varieties of foie gras delights to choose from!\n<br />•\n<br />My favorite was the combo with port wine jelly! YUMS 😍
One of the many highlights include this 48-hour slow cooked Wagyu Beef Leg with a mustard crust.
.\n<br />Whilst this may appear to be a badly taken photograph with unintentional #handinframe, I would argue that this was actually a masterfully orchestrated and professionally crafted shot - I was going for Halloween-inspired Freddy Krueger feels. Really.
The Line has been known for their consistency on its buffet spread for years, and I am glad that they are still delivering quality fare even after a change in their Chef de Cuisine. Available on the spread now is a revamped selection of seafood, roast meat and a huge variety of Foie Gras and cheeses, as well as the usual local fare such as the dim sum, satay and Indian section as well as a huge variety of desserts made in-house. Certainly enjoyed my time there with a few glasses of champagne (free-flow!) while I stuffed myself silly over the meats and desserts which were pretty good such as the Lamb Rack and the Beef Short Ribs. Froyo lovers; don\'t miss the frozen yogurt machine which is guaranteed to make you return for a few more rounds because it\'s just so good! Thanks to Burpple for the opportunity to attend the tasting session today as well as Shangri-La for being a wonderful host!
I\'m on my seventh glass and feeling high with food delirium.
While the amazing cheese selection here warrants skipping the dessert table (yes, really!), the frozen yoghurt was much better than expected and is worth a pit stop (if you still have space); in any case, you can swirl as little/much as you like!
The Line is arguably one of the most well-known places in Singapore for a solid buffet that offers an extensive spread without compromising quality. Seafood lovers — be prepared to indulge. Tackle all the fresh seafood first — oysters, mussels, prawns, lobsters, scallops, crabs, and fresh sashimi. Featuring 16 kitchens that dish out great food all round, it\'s hard to compete with the variety and quality here. You should always be strategic when it comes to buffets, so start with the items you love most, even if that means dessert before seafood! Buffet lunch ($58++) and dinner ($76++) are served daily; champagne brunch ($158++) is served on Sundays. 
Fresh oyster!!! I nearly ate 10pcs!!! The line seafood night at Thursday with alcohol beverage. Cost around $110+ pax, many ppl, seafood is fresh n variety. Dessert n coffee are my favourite. I like the line more than todai @mbs!!!!
If you are looking for a good international buffet and you don\'t mind spending a little bit more, The Line at Shangri-La Hotel is one of the best international buffet you can find in Singapore. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
If you wait until you can do everything for everybody, instead of something for somebody, you\'ll end up doing nothing for nobody. - It\'s not about how much we give, but how much love we put into giving.
Licking till very last bit of it, I can\'t stop asking for more. This has gotta be the best risotto I\'ve ever tried thus far.
Thank you @yvonnesetoh for this wonderful treat, get more promotions yeah.
An interesting find in the salad station. Spicy tasting watermelon as it is mixed with red peppers, salad cream and topped with crispy wanton skin.
Fresh make crispy pancake with green tea ice cream and mango sorbet. Nicex
Baby lobster laksa                                       Drunken prawn in herbal soup! The soup is so powerful! Whahha 
Advance birthday dinner with a dear friend @the \"I always wan to eat at line again\" shangri-la the line. 
Chocolate mousses-dark \"GAO\" chocolate. Passionfruit jelly-sourish sweet.. I like this best. Gula-melaka sago jelly-at least the taste of the gula-Melaka.. Is there... Tiramisu roll-disappointed. Berry jelly- berry too sour... 
Along the cooked station, you get a myriad of ethnic specialties and I will race to the Chinese station the moment I step into the buffet hall. This cream mussels dish sits at the western grilled meat counter next to the Italian section, it taste just so yummy. For every Tue/Thur, the marine harvest night will present free flow of champagne, sparking and wine coupling a wider range of seafood atop the \"ice mountains\", priced at $92/adult. For wine lovers, it\'s quite a nice place to drink n eat your fill..
My 3 visits to The Line were amazing. The selection of seafood which includes oysters, mussels, prawns, crabs and fresh sashimi never disappoints. Dessert wise, even though it is always visually appealing, not all of them taste nice so it just depends on your luck that day. But definitely worth a visit, and don\'t forget to reserve as there is never a day where the line is not full
The Line has easily become most people\'s go-to buffet for a special occasion. With 16 kitchens banging out great dishes all round, it\'s hard to compete with the variety and quality here. The ambience is clean cut and comfortable, allowing you to feel posh and at home at the same time. Do not miss the Japanese and Dessert sections, those are the highlights for sure. Go for Saturday lunch at only $59++, or the International dinner buffet on Sundays at $72++. 
This was supposed to be the post-exams celebratory treat but the timing/circumstances won\'t work out by the time I finish exams. So off we go today. Back to studying later :/
The Line at Shangri La Hotel is without the doubt my best place for international buffet in Singapore. Their dessert station alone is enough to make a meal out of let alone the 15 other live station that it boast about.

Coffee Creme Brulee,  Chocolate Fudge Cake, Mixed Berries Tart and other pastries from the lunch buffet at The Line, Shangri La Hotel
Highlights of the night buffet was seafood but I find the dessert spread stand out here! Enjoy the dessert more than the food. 
Mee rebus! Gravy a little diluted but I was sold on the quail eggs 😋
Ultra crispy &amp; crunchy in its golden coat, thanks to the cornflakes trick. The exterior remained pristine crisp when cold with a buttermilk bathed chicken breast fillet which taste amazingly moist and tender. The light mayo add a final touch to the overall in a delightful manner! Go try it.
Handmade salmon patty compacted with capers, ultra moist and neither overtly cooked nor bitter. The patty is marinated in shoyu and topped with teriyaki bonito flakes lending a sweet flavour. 
The most popular new dish in the a la carte menu, terribly tender in the meat coupled with sweet caramelized onions, arugula, melting cheese and garlic toasted ciabatta, I love it much. 
Light cream based fettuccine topped with sweet crunchy asparagus and a handful of bacon bits for a final boost in flavor. The flying fish roe adds popping elements to the dish. Very refreshing. 
Velvety smooth taste and not spicy steamed fish mousse will be even delicious for kids.
Every bite of these offers a taste-explosion of Thai flavors!
I don\'t really fancy green curry cos it\'s not fiery enough for me. But this is not bad, a little salty thou.
Fried rice crackers with pork &amp; prawn paste, salted egg and chilli jam. The assorted chutneys offer a delicious combination of sweet, salty and spicy to the crackers.
Here for the \'Spicy Thai\' media tasting! Promo runs from 17-26 May.
Scrumptious Thai delights from their resident Thai chef, available till 26 May. Details: http://bit.ly/11EFTf3
The drink is filled with gracious Thai flavours of lemongrass, lime, chillis, mint leaf. A sophisticated ways to bring out the sweetness, tangy and hot (spicy) all in a drink. Spicy but very morish, it leave your taste buds tingling in expectation.
Chai Mai style tom yam goong was gentle to the palate, not the usual explosion of tom yam.
I enjoy the nice subtle flavour of the traditional snack from Thailand. But felt the taste of the leaf was a tad empowering.

Wide range of food (esp desserts), quality food and great service. 
Customized. The chocolate cake is moist and robust in taste. Very delicious and not cloying sweet.

Amazing seafood buffet
Always a popular item, snatch up really fast.
Hand crafted pretty cakes. Feast for eyes and mouth. 
Handcrafted goodies. Each taste distinctly differently and yummy.
Standing on ice. Really fresh.
Half buried in ice. Each one is sweet. Indulgence.

Hope to start off this year healthier and fitter (almost everyone every new year resolution). Since did lose some calories need to recall the gain calories to lose more ahead. #tbt becos #throwback about last Thurs. 😜 was very looking forward towards this cos heard lots of good reviews. Maybe cos good reviews expectation become high... felt that it was not worth to pay more for seafood night (esep when we don\'t like taking wine, beer), nt much different from normal days. Oysters were fresh and nice but don\'t need to purposely pay more for marine harvest night to enjoy these. Truffle mash potatoes was good too (but go buffet find this as best dish smth not right..) And I am a very dessert person; sad that more than their main desserts; teh tarik, tea, and the complimentary birthday cake stand out the most (b\'day cake very yumm surprisingly, but need bring home eat cos heavy cheesecake). #thelinebuffet #shangrila #burpple #sgfood
Perfect day to kick start 👍🏼
Great spread of all types. Yummy and wonderful experience 
Free flow house pour sparkling wines, red and white wines, draft beer, soft drinks and chilled juices.\n<br />And not to forget delectable Christmas treats such as turkey and roast beef. \n<br />#SFL #ketohloh #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #8dayseat #openricesg #instafood_sg #burpple #cafehopping #sgig #hungrygowhere #foodsg #iweeklyfood #sgfoodporn #burpplesg #instasg #sgfoodspotting #eatoutsg #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #singaporeinsiders #food #foodhunter #sipandgulp #sgcafefood #igfoodies #igsg #foodiesg #sgcafe

This is the #tomahawk cut, it\'s #bloody good. 🐂 #SundayChampagneBrunch
Mushroom. 😝 for those who love their Indian food.....
Chocolate Chip Foie Gras anyone?
-\n<br />Choose from three cake flavours (Double Choco Crunch, the fruity and tart Midsummer Berry Passion and the vanilla, fruit jelly and feuilletine-based Vanilla-Vanilla), three box designs and 50 unique messages, and you\'re good to go!
This dish is called Chilli Crab to go, part of the buffet line up.  The bread base infused with chilli crab flavour,  with gellish yolk on top crab meat with fried egg and mini herbs. \n<br />A unique taste.  It is nice to eat on its own,  but so much better when I add chilli crab gravy. \n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #thelinesg #sgfoodie #sgfoodblogger #foodbloggersg #burrple #sgeat #modsin #igsg #igsgfoodie #foodporn #foodgasm #instafoodsg #chillicrab #openricesg #hungrygowhere #sgbuffet #buffetsg #shangrilasg
