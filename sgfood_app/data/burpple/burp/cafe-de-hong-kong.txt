Cafe De Hong Kong is probably the only place I rather be eating outside of our home. The food is always delicious and well executed and it is the type of cuisine that I will so at home with and will have no hesitation coming back again and again for. Utterly cosy and heartwarming food that has rarely seen any negatives, only positives and we always leave here completely satisfied and happy :)\n<br />#BestPlaceToBe #cafedehongkong #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #comfortfood
