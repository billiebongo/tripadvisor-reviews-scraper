The best affordable duck confit around since the standard at budget French joint Saveur skydived. At least here, the duck is consistently meaty, flesh falls off the bone with a gentle nudge of the fork, and the skin is decently crispy. And how can I ever say no to soft, dreamy potato gratin? 
This is La Petite at its finest: so much bite concealed in skins of silken dough. And if a cream sauce could ever be refreshing, this one brightened with fresh herbs, tomatoes and lemon juice is it. 
The dish proved it\'s worth of $15.50 with 3 \"dumplings\" each containing a relatively large shrimp with a small piece of goose liver. The individual taste of each part of the dish was good enough to make you savor every single small chunk of meat! When it all comes together with its creamy sauce, this dish is just too perfect for such an affordable price tag, even my fren who went France commented that the food was better here than there. However, do not expect too much of a service from its staff, although the chef himself would take a walk around the restaurant asking about your comments for your food! :)
Medium steak with really good potato gratin. Served with mustard sauce. $15.80
One of the best foie gras that I have ever tasted, in Singapore. It\'s cooked to perfection, crisp on the outside but melts instantly when placed in the mouth. The orange sauce complement and enhance the natural flavor of the foie gras. The best part? It\'s cheap and worth every penny, on this huge portion of foie gras. || Price: S$19
At La Petite, you get to enjoy French favourites at not-so-crazy prices. This humble, cosy bistro is located in the outer corridor of Serene Centre. Order (at the counter) the escargots on toasted croissant ($14) to share, and the Confit du Canard (duck leg) for your main at $16.50. The duck is cooked to perfection, crispy skin with tender flesh, and an addictive potato gratin on the side.
After tasting the foie gras at this authentic French cafe, it changes my view towards foie gras. It\'s not just culinary delight, but a comfortable, effortless, dinner night out. #yummy #foodspotting #french
A little too tough for my liking.
haven\'t been here in a while, missed their food!
Toasted croissant and buttery escargots 
Freshly made.
Fresh brewed ground roasted coffee. Excellent place to chill and relax. Wifi friendly. 
Slathered in the rich, thick and zesty brown mushroom sauce, it will definitely strike a chord with all the lamb rack lovers out there.
The duck confit; one of my all time favourites. I\'ll burn it all up later. #foodgasm #foodporn #cravings #creatureofhabit #burpple
One of the most affordable foie-gras in Singapore, simply executed. Just like one of those home-run, no frills cafes in France. About damn time. #cravings #addictions #foodporn #foodgasm #burpple
