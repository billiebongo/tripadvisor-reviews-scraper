Crispy pancetta, shimeji, seaweed \"okayu\". Scallops are always welcome‚Ä¶ wouldn\'t mind more scallops though‚Ä¶\n<br />#Burpple #BurppleEatup #TheDisgruntledChef
With the insane weather, all you\'re craving for is a sweet treat &amp; some cold ice cream! Albeit a relatively small portion, the sweetness of the toffee cuts through even when it\'s paired with the Bourbon Vanilla ice cream. A perfect combination of hot &amp; cold, this dish was easily cleaned up, with many nodding in agreement over a satisfied meal. 
It\'s not the type of thing I would find myself ordering in such an establishment, and definitely one I found surprising to find in the dessert menu here. Nonetheless, this is their rendition of a churro where other places usually serve Churros with ice-cream, but they have tweaked their version so that the chocolate ice-cream, coffee ice-cream and vanilla ice-cream sits within a gigantic Churro shaped into a bowl. Sure, it does carry the same sugary and cinnamony flavours you would expect with relative crispness, and the batter felt decent without being too thick but it does trap a little oil within so you get that oily flavour in the aftertaste. It\'s not bad an attempt, but I would go for the Sticky Toffee Pudding any day instead.
The star of the night. At one point of the tasting before dessert, we were mentioning about The Lokal\'s wonderful Sticky Date Pudding (we had no idea that we would try this Sticky Toffee Pudding), but when we had a first taste of The Disgruntled Chef\'s Sticky Toffee Pudding it was a tough fight. This was sweet to the right amount ‚Äî it\'s moist, sticky and light with relative fluff and even the vanilla ice-cream is rich, aromatic and smooth. Definitely the dessert to order here!
Cheekily named, the dish is much of a pun itself just like how it is being named. Pairing up avocado ice-cream with a shot of espresso, it also comes with cotton candy stacked atop the scoops of ice-cream. The avocado ice-cream is smooth, buttery and totally something I would want to have all by itself, and while the espresso does help to give it that Avocado Coffee infusion, the shot can get a little overwhelming and steals the show for itself (something I clearly don\'t mind being a coffee person). Thankfully, the bits of cotton candy helps to add a little sweetness when the espresso gets a little too much, but the coffee lover in me would probably prefer it without the cotton candy somehow.
Crispy Duck Confit, Foie Gras Butter, PX Gastrique. The staff who served this dish to us seemed to have mentioned \"burnt onions\" for one of the ingredients for the waffles. The waffles were crisp, and I liked the savoury aroma of the burnt onions running within that differs it from the usual charcoal waffles (which more often than not tastes not very different from normal waffles) which went well with the savoury Foie Gras butter that was flavourful, yet doesn\'t carry that liver-ish stench that usually comes at the end. The duck skin was crisp, but admittedly the flesh of the duck confit could be a little more moist for a better texture. Despite so, the dish is pretty well-executed overall with interesting elements such as the burnt onions and Foie Gras Butter thrown into play.
This rainy morning calls for some comfort food üòå dreaming of this Braised Veal Cheek I had last Friday at TGC. Not the most photogenic dish, but it would be a pity if I didn\'t share it! The veal cheek was so incredibly fork-tender and slightly creamy in flavour, an indulgence for the palate. Paired with a lightly crisp Yorkshire pudding, there was a good balance of texture in this dish. It was my favourite main dish for this meal! This was a invited tasting by @thedisgruntledchef, and many thanks to @burpple too! #burpple #burppletastemaker #foodporn
Chilled Milk Cabbage, Pickled Shimeiji, Ponzu. One of the dishes that was very Asian-inspired for the flavours seemed to kick off very familiar Chinese home-style tastes especially for the milk cabbage. The pickled Shimeiji was also pretty interesting with a little sweetness, but the main star definitely still retained its limelight for being subtle in flavour without carrying any fishy flavour whilst achieving the smooth, semi-cooked state that it was in. 
Not the best dish to photograph for the Braised Veal Cheeks sit atop a giant Yorkshire pudding with wilted spinach sitting in the middle. The large chunks of veal cheeks were really tender without being gamey, and the Yorkshire pudding gives a satisfying sponginess when eaten together while the spinach helps to cut the flavours of the beef in attempts of not making it feel too heavy. For those who prefer to keep things lighter, do control the amount of brown sauce to pour for it may get a little too heavy-handed if the entire portion were to be poured in.
I half expected this to be dry and tough but @thedisgruntledchef proved me wrong! Crisp on the surface but oh so tender on the inside. üòç
Lamb has never been the first choice of meat for me, but I found this pretty acceptable that I went for two. Sure, the gamey taste that most finds intimidating is still around, but I like how mild the gaminess was for its just a two-second process from the moment you place it in your mouth. Look past the two seconds, and the lamb is immensely tender as it melts in the mouth amidst the crisp exterior that seems to kill off the gaminess before it gets too much ‚Äî you would find that it\'s possible not to use a fork and knife as the meat comes off the bone cleanly even if you use your hands. Something that isn\'t really in my comfort zone, but definitely worked well with me!
If you like small sandwiches and truffle, this is for you. In between the toasts, the Brie is thick and rich, yet exudes a light cheesiness that it\'s so luxurious with the savoury Iberico ham. Simple it might look, but the crusty bread, smooth cheese and the flavours of truffle gives a rather satiating combination of taste and texture, it\'s hard not to attempt to keep the entire portion all to yourself.
Even though it lacks of that stretchy cheese that one might be expecting from pulling the Mac &amp; Cheese apart, this was still beyond satisfying. The Mac &amp; Cheese here feels rather easy to finish especially with the addition of truffle ‚Äînever a moment where it felt as if it had the overwhelming cheesiness or creaminess so it hardly gets anywhere near jelat. There are also bits of crayfish within, which were pretty fresh and have the dish a qq-texture on certain bites. Despite being a carby and cheese-laden dish, it was so delightful we found ourselves mopping the entire plate clean!
First dish to be served to the table for The Disgruntled Chef\'s tastings is the BBQ Pork Belly Bao. Described as \"kimchi, mayonnaise and pair of steamed buns\", don\'t expect the usual pork belly that you would get with the Kong Ba Bao ‚Äî The Disgruntled Chef infuses a touch of Korean with their version, using leaner pork slices marinated in Bulgogi which was pretty smart and worked out very well despite using a local element for the basis of the dish.
I was excited to receive the invitation from Burpple for a tasting at The Disgruntled Chef because it\'s a restaurant that\'s been on my \"To Try\" list for quite a while now. Well, the experience was very pleasant indeed. Apart from the relaxing and cosy ambience, I found every dish served to us tonight, really appealing.\n<br />One of the standouts for me, personally, was the Saikyo Miso Hamachi Collar ($34++) which came with chilled milk cabbage and picked shimeiji mushrooms. The delicate miso was a great match for the exceedingly smooth and soft flesh of the fish. Even though the portion wasn\'t huge, I still feel the unique deliciousness of this makes it worth getting.
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />If you like your duck confit very much on the crispy side, this will be right up your alley. I found the slightly cushiony charcoal waffle with its lightly crunchy finish a good fit for it. Expanding the flavour profile of this dish was a savoury element from the foie gras butter and a rich sweetness courtesy of a sauce made from Pedro Ximenaz, a type of dark dessert sherry.\n<br />In my opinion, one of the most memorable dishes among the numerous memorable dishes at the tasting.
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />The spiciness of the BBQ Pork Belly Bao stuffed between the puffy dough caught me by surprise but did I mind? Nope, not one bit! üòçüòãüòã\n<br />And in case you\'re wondering, all credit for the terrific kick belongs to the dual power of kimchi and spicy mayo.
A mix of pineapple, passionfruit and pomegranate. Refreshing starts‚Ä¶\n<br />#Burpple #BurppleEatup #TheDisgruntledChef
1st visit here and overall it was good. except for the prawns which was deep fried with the shells on, and the creamed spinach w the tenderloin that was abit too heavily creamed. Cod was nicely baked with a hint of miso, the seaweed &amp; clams rice that was served with it tasted like seafood porridge! It\'s interesting to have a lava cake with a peanut butter and chocolate centre, sweetness well balanced with a tinge of saltiness.  Service was prompt too. 
Slightly too firm, though the truffle oil definitely came through. Not bad. 
Loved the crispy skin, though tge salmon itself came off slightly overcooked and tough. 
A luscious coat of milk chocolate breaks apart to reveal a richly dense concoction of cream and cheese. The subtle floral and honey notes of the vanilla-tinged cream plays very well with the sharp, intense flavours of the Roquefort. Now, this is how you do dessert. Somebody needs to pack this for sale on supermarket shelves. Ok, that\'s all.
Juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes introduce a subtle tartness to soften the cloyingness on the palate. The best pasta dish always looks like it has just been simply thrown together without much fuss, just like this one. Ok, that\'s all.
You scream its name, you don\'t say it demurely because why will you not be excited when you see a platter like this? Just look at the colour of that skin and imagine how it crackles ever so lightly as you bite into it. Then as you sink your teeth further into it, imagine that luscious bite of meat and fat...melding together and melting slowly in your mouth. It makes you salivate just a little, doesn\'t it? What a nice touch to serve this rich dish with a pur√©e made from sauerkraut of purple cabbage...the colour is just gorgeous. So are those beads of pickled mustard seeds. The balance in flavours and textures in this one is spot-on. Ok, that\'s all.
That glorious crust is made from a melange of roughly chopped escargots ‚Äî nice and firm ‚Äî mixed with chopped parsley, breadcrumbs and minced garlic (or simply persillade, if you wish). Tissue-thin, cracker-crisp...the baguette toast acts as a vessel to scoop it all up while also provides texture. Such a beauty. Ok, that\'s all.
It works well as a sharing dish, it works #flawless-ly as a one-dish meal too. This pot is made with a heady mix of curry powder, coriander, cumin and lemongrass. The mussels are plump and juicy...soaking up all the spices and burst obscenely as you bite into them. The curry sauce finds its companion in the accompanying toasted sourdough toast...you don\'t dip, you mop it all up. And you lick every last bit of the sauce from all the shells before you throw them into an empty bowl. Ok, that\'s all.
Three generous hunks of snow crab, flakes ever so lightly as you poke it with your fork, become its accompaniment along with kombu dust ‚Äì amazingly briny and perks the palate with the flavours of the sea. I can eat this every day. Ok, that\'s all.
Like ever. Crispy short ribs...that cumin-laced crust is to die for, so is the fork-tender meat which gives way to every bite so effortlessly. An exemplar of the perfect pairing is the accompanying cous cous ‚Äì lightly buttery with just enough flavours to not overshadow the lamb. Chunky mint yoghurt ‚Äî mint strands and crunchy cucumber brunoise ‚Äî cools the palate and readies it for your next bite. Ok, that\'s all.
This salad of blanched then lightly buttered haricots verts and obscenely juicy and sweet cherry tomatoes get a luxe upgrade by way of creamy foie gras terrine and drizzles of aged balsamic. Cracks of sea salt bring it all together nicely. Ok, that\'s all.
So much bite in this one with the crab and lobster getting a subtle truffle oil treatment, adding to the luxurious mouthfeel. The finely chopped chives pop with slight oniony aroma. The crown of Granny Smith batons adds crunch to the texture and introduces that refreshing note to the mix. A personal favourite is the bun itself ‚Äì light crisp on the crust, crumbles easily and breaks effortlessly. Ok, that\'s all.
here a year later and we come upon this dish on the menu.
For me this is the best among all the outstanding dishes tonight. The crab meat was really fresh and sweet! I was also thrilled that they use my favourite angel hair as their choice of pasta. I definitely want to eat this again!
This is my first time tasting quail meat, and it was very much like chicken, just much more tender and moist. Not sure to attribute this to the chef\'s superb cooking skills or is this characteristic of quail meat? This also comes with a perfectly poached egg, bacon bits, and a delightful fris√©e salad underneath. 
These tasty lamb shortribs used to be served on their own as a starter, but now they are served atop a bed of couscous (which I didn\'t take a liking to) as main course. Abit less tender and less fatty than the previous times I had them, but still as delicious, especially when smeared with the subtly mint-y yogurt sauce.
I just love how this dish tastes so strongly of truffle! Definitely one of the best Mac n cheese around. 
Excellent service, great ambience, and great food! It\'s the perfect place for weekend brunch. The duck confit came with truffled poached eggs and 2 slabs of foie gras, and only cost $25! Looking forward to my next visit.
My favourite of the weekend brunch tartines that I tried at my tasting, this has bostock brioche slathered with almond cream and piled with sliced almonds, served with a scoop of the most heavenly prune and Armagnac ice cream ‚Äì tastes like rum &amp; raisin, but better. 
Off-the-menu dishes that chef Daniel Sia specially made for a story I\'m working on. Crazy how delicious he made this vegetable taste!! 
An entire pig\'s leg for at least two to share, with sauerkraut pur√©e (love the royal purple hue it adds to the plate, though it\'s a bit dark in this photo) and pickled mustard seeds to alleviate any greasiness of the meat ‚Äì not that there\'s much, really. The crackling is the most noteworthy, with its light, snappy texture, not bogged down with excess fat. 
I love how this plate looks like a work of art. And it tastes delicious as well ‚Äì the cook on the quail was just spot-on, not overdone (it\'s very easy to overcook such a small bird), and it went beautifully with the poached egg, fris√©e, and crispy bacon chips. Surprising that it didn\'t have a gamier taste, either. 
Have you ever seen salmon such a pretty shade of pink?! üòç So refreshing with horseradish mustard seeds. 
My kind of brunch tartine with a load of lobster chunks and melted gruyere. üòç
It\'s Friday! Happy day! Have a silky blue cheese ice cream encased in a chocolate shell. 
Seafood carpaccio usually come with an acidic dressing, but this one has drops of salty soy brown butter sauce and just a hint of lime to pair with the sweetness of the Hokkaido scallops. Very fresh and very delicious. 
One of my favourite dishes! It was great catching up with @debbieyong, @jillyeats &amp; @nnonsequitur today. #love #yummy

The Pear Tree is a concoction of pear, lime and mint which is light and refreshing. For a more tangy counterpart, the Bora-Bora made up of a mixture of pineapple, passionfruit and pomegranate will lift the day on a bright note.
The macaroni also retained a delectable bite. This is definitely one of the better version I have eaten for a long while.
Actually I thought the condiments were not necessary as the meat was already so good on it own. The crackling skin and the tender meat, there is nothing more I can ask for.
I am not a big fan of yorkshire pudding but the braised veal cheeks were braised excellent to a melted in the mouth texture.
The sandwich toast is layered with black truffle, iberico ham and brie. The combination gives it a richness that is very addictive to just stop at three.
It shows the diverse culinary knowledge of Chef and owner Daniel Sia. The softness of the collar meat has a lovely hint of sweetness from the soy sauce base marinade, grilled to a nice smokey aroma.
The pork belly is sandwiched in between fluffy steamed bao and paired with house made kimchi, dressed in a spicy mayonnaise. The modern interpretation of steamed bao is a delightful introduction to the new brunch menu.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #brunch #thedisgruntledchef #steamedbao #porkbelly #kimchi
whipped cream lies at the bottom, then comes two dollops of avocado ice cream. What you do not see is the green cotton candy which was already dissolved after the espresso was poured over it.
For those that prefer something light, this will be a good choice.
Time to let your hair down. How about checking out the cool selection of cocktail at TDC. The Bee\'s Knees is served in a teapot. The mixture consists of chamomile infused gin, grand marnier, lemon, orange and honey.
Moist, not too sweet and had the right amount of caramel.  The dessert made up for what is lacking in the savory part of the meal.
Its tartness helps \"refresh\" the palate with every mouthful. Ok, that\'s all.
on another note.  when do you its enough
Braised eggplant in olive oil, with pine nuts and mint ‚Äì so moreish. Typically served on grilled pita, but customers on a gluten-free diet can request for the bread to be omitted. 
Not peanut butter, but Nutella (which is very nearly as good) and caramelised banana fill this French toast, with vanilla ice cream on the side. Simple but so satisfying. Available only during weekend brunch.
