Bottoms up! 🍺🍻
Awesome sat brunch menu. Dine on the 33rd floor of MBFC with one of the most spectacular views in singapore
Amazing and captivating
Desserts = Beers: Blond Lager, Pumpkin, Wheat, Pale Ale, Stout respectively.. :) particularly like the Blond (light yet fruity refreshing) and Stout (roasted and almost taste a bit like coffee).. A good place to chill.. Thanks my sista for the time and feast for the eyes and taste buds.. Hehe
Imagine you watching fireworks here at Level 33 for NDP! 😊
Roasted wagyu striploin sandwich with onion marmalade, wholegrain mustard, watercress, fat cut chips and 33.1 Blond Lager infused ketchup! 
Southern fried spring chicken with tomatoes and jalapeño salsa, creamed corn and blistered baby potatoes! 
One of the many dishes for sharing on the menu. Level 33 is a great place to chill out for group gatherings.
This is really good. Goes well with a glass of rose. Pricing is pretty decent. Paid about $40 for food and drink. 
Lemon Tart

Awesome Christmas Special. Has all the Christmas favourites in one dish. Turkey, stuffing, sausages, pumpkins, Brussels sprouts ....
A knock out combo of Onion &amp; beer. YOLO
Wanted some fries to pair with the wine and cocktails. Ermmm... the fries are a little too chunky! 😁 #level33 #love #fries #cocktails #mbs #prettyview #singapore #sgfood #sgeats #sgfoodies #wineanddine #sgbars #mixology #barbites #beerpairing #brewery #beer #beerporn #burpple #weekendersg #nailart #burpplesg #foodporn #mbfc #singaporeinsiders
But what\'s good here is also their food and desserts. Try their berries tart if you love berries.
I\'m craving some meat right now...
HUGE portion that comes with affordable price! 😍 #instafood #burpplesg #burpple
Great food, amazing company. This Heritage Carrot dish got us in a really tickled state. Full post up on www.foodievstheworld.com tonight!
Semi buffet spread. 
Chicken supreme, sassafras brine, chargrilled capsicum, roasted fennel and Hokkaido corn veloutè.                                                             This was sadly the lease favorite out of our 3 meat choices.

3.5 munchies: The kipfler potatoes may be sightly underdone, but fortunately the herb-flecked, salt-crusted skin had a tinge of crispiness. There was also a good balance of saltiness from the punchy salsa verde (green sauce) and sweetness from the onion compote, which makes it a pleasant side dish/appetiser for sharing.
Now that\'s life. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
F1 Party here, always love their brew
