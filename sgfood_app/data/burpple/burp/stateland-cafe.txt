Strange combi that went surprisingly well tgt. .\n<br />🍴\n<br />Waffles could be a bit crispier and more chocolatey but the sticky gooey marshmallows did save the day. And the refreshing coconut soft serve helped to cleanse the palette. We devoured it in less than 5 minutes 😂\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #stateland #waffles #softserve
Yes for the kimchi carbonara 👌🏻 but the service from the waitress was bad 🙄
Items: 1) Mentaiko Tiger Prawn Aglio Olio, 2) Korean Soy Chicken on Waffle
so much tobiko roe, the in between pop inside your mouth with the mentaiko sauce was insatiable. best to share a bowl if jelakness gets to you easily but otherwise, enjoy the ultimate mentaiko treat
Overall a good one with interesting textures and subtly different flavours, major love for the tender chicken, but the risotto got a tad heavy at the end of the meal.
It was refreshing combi but got a bit \"jelat\" towards the end
1. Stole my heart cause it looks so pretty. \n<br />2. It\'s Roasted Black Sesame with matcha?!?! 
Seen this on Burpple for awhile so I\'ve decided to visit today. Menu is different from what\'s online. The $20 set lunch is available today (Sunday). Comes with coffee of choice. The coffee here is good. Good value for money. Service is really fast. Hope they turn the air con stronger though! (7.1/10)
I like that Stateland tries to do something different apart from the usual cafe (read: boring) stuff. Here, a generous slab of salmon is cooked to pink succulence, paired with bouncy Korean glass noodles in a yuzu-inflected broth. What surprised me was the use of fresh dill, which immediately took the flavours off the charts. Great for a light, yet immensely flavourful option.
The mochi texture is really good and chewy. The salted egg yolk was nice and liquid flowing. I had the cookie butter ice cream with the mochi. The cornflakes are really good and gave extra texture to the ice cream.
🤗🤗\n<br />-\n<br />Here\'s an after-church lunch idea: @statelandcafe. Went there the other day and twas my first time trying their foods ㅡ been there a few times only for the desserts ㅡ and guess what? They\'re all SO GOOD! Like no-kidding good.
Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto 🐔: This dish is SO ON POINT 💯💯💯 Really tastes like chicken rice but is extra hearty and comforting in risotto form and the nice soy sauce like broth. Made perfect with crispy chicken skin and fried shallots! 😍
Had this and the salmon pho! Was a total hit this time. The salmon was a generous portion and the yuzu broth was so delicious we slurped it all up. Since we shared a main we had space for the marshmallow waffle. The soft serve flavour was Tokyo banana and it\'s not bad but I wouldn\'t order again. Waffle was really heavy. Will try the doughnut one next time!
A short five-minute walk from Bugis MRT Station, this industrial-chic cafe dishes out Asian-fusion bowls inspired by the owners\' East Asia trip. The menu is straightforward — there are nine main courses available, and each comes with a complimentary drink (you\'re free to choose ANY drink from the drinks menu!). Prices are nett, portions are hearty and flavours are spot on, making this the perfect cafe stop if you\'re in the vicinity. We love the Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto ($20) that comes with tender soy braised chicken on a bed of incredibly flavourful ginger risotto, served with a spicy sriracha chilli vinaigrette. Another winner in our books is the Mentaiko Tiger Prawn Pasta ($20) that features linguine tossed in a lightly torched mentaiko dressing. You won\'t want to miss out on their desserts! Be sure to ask for Brother Bird\'s (they share the same space) menu and get the Tokyo Banana ($14), a banana soft serve topped on their signature mochi donut that is reminiscent of a well-made hum jin pang.\n<br />Avg Price: $30 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Kelly Wong
☀️ Cookie Butter soft serve paired with Salted Egg Liu Sha Mochi donuts ($15) from @brotherbirdsg. #burpple
What are the odds. I can\'t quite believe that it took me so long (probably a couple of years?) before I finally landed myself at @statelandcafe because it simply blew my mind when every single item on the menu sounded appealing. #notkidding. We were spent the longest time in a dilemma before...unanimously deciding that we were all going to order the Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto ($20) 😂 I haven\'t had chicken rice in, what, years again probably? And it was a wonderful feeling digging into this dish. A deliciously accurate makeover of the much-loved hawker dish: tender, juicy white chicken ✔️ fragrant rice ✔️ kickass chili 💥✔️. This was SHIOK. It was incredibly filling, yet so addictive that it was hard to resist. Value-for-money too, as prices are met and you get a free drink too (even for dinner)! I highly recommend the lychee lemonade 🍹#burpple #burpproved
One very uniquely constructed dessert!! It\'s so filling I suggest sharing it with 2-3 people! \n<br />The sweetness of the cookie dough soft serve pairs really well with the savoury doughnut. I can only compare this combination with the likes of fried mars ball! However, a few mouthful of it might just leave you requesting for another cup of water!
Where will you be heading to today? 📸 is the Hainanese Risotto ($21), a clever fusion dish featuring our favourite Hainanese chicken, spicy chili sauce on a bed of risotto rice.\n<br />•\n<br />Stateland Asian-Fusion Cafe\n<br />Address: 32, Bali Lane, Singapore 189866\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #statelandcafe #brotherbirdsg
Back at Stateland to try their new Tokyo Banana soft serve but we can\'t resist ordering their mains. From our favourite dishes Hainanese Chinese Rice Risotto ($20), Mentaiko Tiger Prawn Pasta ($20), Truffle Fries ($11) to trying new dishes such as Kimchi Carbonara ($18) and Soy Korean Fried Chicken Waffles ($18).
Enjoyed this flavoursome ice cream! I\'m intrigued by the swirls, it\'s so cute! Texture had a bit of frostiness, loved it👍🏼
This was so stunning! The best part about this was the cracker bits and flaky garnish that gave the meal a exciting crunch and texture to the risotto dish. The chicken was tender, vegetables were a tidy portion. I love this dish to bits! ❤️
Loved the mix of ang Moh and Singaporean food in one plate;) really like how it was topped off with chicken rice chilli! Heheh
I have to admit feeling quite excited when seeing this on the menu. A Green Curry Donburi, promising luscious green curry and crisp fried chicken — what part of that doesn\'t sound yummy as hell? My favourite component of this rice bowl\'s definitely the fried chicken. Cause it\'s pretty massive, fairly lean, moist and juicy, and it\'s thin, crunchy batter was just 👌🏻👌🏻 Would\'ve liked more curry to go with it, but beyond that this is really #Burpproved
.
The broth was bright and refreshing, the salmon was superb, soft, fleshy and fresh.\n<br />-\n<br />I like how stateland is moving away from the conventional menu and bringing us fusion dishes that are warm, comforting and still feel close to heart. Definitely a contender for uniqueness.\n<br />-\n<br />Monster thinks eating salmon right off the bone it\'s brute and bearish, but he loves it anyway.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #statelandcafe #burpple
Decided to give this place a try after seeing it on burpples top 100 list, and it\'s a nice little cafe with interesting menu choices. Weekday lunch gives you a main plus any drink for $20 so it\'s quite value for money. However our choices was hit and miss, the mentaiko pasta was waaay too salty and over-creamy, but generous with prawns, would not order again. The Hainanese Chicken Risotto was lovely comfort food with very generous amount of tender chicken. Also had the wintermelon soft serve which was lovely and refreshing. Would definitely pop by to try the other mains next time! #BurpplexChope
What a way to complete your meal after all the nice comfort cafe food from Stateland! Interesting flavour I must say, for the first time being here. (Most of the desserts were sold out by the time we went there) But it\'s okay, at least we tried this. The mochi is really chewy and it goes well with the soft serve ice cream! What can go wrong. Right?
❤️\n<br />•\n<br />To be quite honest, these felt as if they came out from an authentic Japanese gyoza shop.\n<br />•\n<br />The mentaiko sauce was a tad salty for my liking, but otherwise a very good complement to the gyoza! Loved the liberal sprinkling of fish roe as well! 😋

I love all things fried chicken, especially if it\'s of the Korean variety. So, jumped in on this order without hesitation. The chicken was fried very nicely, slathered with a great sticky soy sauce and served atop a waffle. The waffle was only ok, a little overcooked for my liking, super crisp and didn\'t have enough of a \"waffley flavour\" (is that a thing?). 
Having some Hainanese Chicken Rice or @statelandcafe risotto version sounds tempting!
Ok guys. This needs to be renamed SPECTACULARLY GREAT braised beef cheek risotto 😍. I swearz this is the best thing I\'ve ever tasted. Ginger risotto with beef cheeks (the tempura looking thing at the ), soy broth, spring onion, and cubes of pickled radish and seaweed with each bites that compliments everything so well. There\'s also a huge braised daikon camouflaged with the broth at the bottom front.
How do I begin to describe this dish? Lets see. For starters, the tiger prawns were fresh, nicely shelled, and had a crunchy bite. The chilli flakes on the pasta were slightly overwhelming for me as I have a low tolerance for heat. But it did make the pasta more fragrant.
-\n<br />I would have to say I\'m pleasantly surprised by how well everything comes together in this bowl. The risotto soaks up the essence of the soy broth, culminating into this umami richness that\'s warm and homely.\n<br />-\n<br />Thoroughly enjoyed myself.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #statelandcafe
Stateland Café has evolved from your evolved from your everyday café to a full fledged bistro serving outstanding fusion food.\n<br />Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto - soy braised chicken, ginger risotto, sriracha vinaigrette, nai bai, fried shallots, chicken skin and spring onion.
Actually my first time having a meal at Stateland and I\'m absolutely in love with it!\n<br />_\n<br />1. Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto\n<br />2. Mentaiko Tiger Prawn Pasta
Their soft serve is all made in house and Chem Yu , the owner of Stateland Cafe is able to experiment with the different flavours. I\'m so looking forward to many more to come!\n<br />🔅\n<br />Thanks @statelandcafe @brotherbirdsg for the complimentary soft serve!\n<br />🔅\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋Stateland Cafe\n<br />💰$6\n<br />🍴32 Bali Lane, Singapore 189866
•\n<br />Perhaps a little more picky this time as we found the noodles a tad too soft for our liking and the broth somewhat confusing with a forgotten yuzu promise 😅. That said, the salmon was still as delicious, or even better than before 😘💕!
No doubt a must-try in my books, Stateland offers solid culinary creations and some of the best vibes amongst popular hipster cafes in the local scene. The ground floor level tends to get rather noisy when it\'s a full house, but the second storey is where all the cozy furnishings and Tumblr-worthy adornments are at. For $20, tuck into this Mentaiko Pasta that is actually a lot more filling than it appears. Fresh and juicy prawns aplenty, addictive mentaiko mayo sauce. Creates an interesting attempt at fusion that does in fact taste good, albeit a little too heavy-handed on the chilli for a spice wimp like myself.
Flavours were absolutely incredible and we could even smell the aromatic dill herb before the dish arrived at our table 👃🏻💕. It was so good that we couldn\'t find any fault in this well-balanced and harmoniously flavoured •Salmon Noodles [$22]• ❤️\n<br />•\n<br />40°C Salmon•Tobiko•Yuzu Broth•Edamame•Fresh Dill•Cherry Tomatoes•Shitake Mushroom•Rice Noodles\n<br />•\n<br />And if that\'s not enough, @statelandcafe is currently having a 1 for 1 promotion on their dinner items between 6pm to 8pm on weekdays, for the month of November; WHAT A STEALLL 😱💕!
The owner got his inspiration after trying a dim sum dish that strangely saw braised brisket flash fried before dishing up, and found the flavours and textures too interesting. And in comes this Tender Beef Rice bowl: super moist and tender braised brisket, holding its texture while still retaining some beefy bite, flash fried then served with al dente risotto and a fabulously braised slice of daikon. So. Good.
Chicken Rice set ($25 nett)
A modern take on a classic dish we\'ve all come to know and love, I don\'t think I would have normally ordered this but after reading Nobelle\'s thoughts about it on Burpple, I knew I had to try it. 😝
Mentaiko Aglio Olio set ($25 nett)
Mentaiko aglio olio ($21) for mentai lover. Salthy and slightly spicy, I like this fusion style. The fried mushroom was in a big portion, the taste get quite sick after eating too much of it. Might consider selling at smaller portion in the future.
Tried the earl grey mochi this time round. The earl greay insert just oooze out when we cut it. Woohoo~ the soft serve taste as good as ever. Will definitely go back again. Price S$15
Oh I just get so very excited seeing a swirly soft serve. Still like their cereal flavour most. #BurppleXChope
This is like the best mix (prolly the only) of kimchi &amp; carbonara. In love with it! There\'s this mild sweetness and taste of kimchi in it. My favorite part is the fried shallots that are poured in top of the dish. Exquisite taste!
This place would be great to visit if you want interesting and tasty dessert! Service ain\'t so great as we requested our desert to be served after food but it came altogether. By the time, we digged into this dish, it was half melted. 😣\n<br />Nevertheless, the Liusha was delicious and the combination of the soft serve was refreshing! Would recommend this!
This is a so-so dish. Nothing in particular that excites my taste bud about this. If you like your spaghetti hard, you can try this but I prefer mind cooked a tad longer.
I would give this dish a 10 / 10 for creativity. But it does not taste as good as it looks, which was alittle disappointing. The Risotto was undercooked and the vegetables is raw. However, the chicken was luckily very tender and taste good! A saving grace! Definitely worth to try but I wouldn\'t it eat it again.
I thought it\'d be all tangy and sharp, but the dish was surprisingly light and well-balanced in flavours. I liked how the cream had a touch of sweet, taming the fiery and in-your-face kimchi. Would\'ve of course been much better with legit smokey bacon instead of meh turkey bacon, but then given the area it\'s no biggie I guess. A great pasta, though my heart still belongs to their Mentaiko Aglio Olio 😉
Catching Jynx and Haunters is hard work, so I popped by Stateland Cafe (or Brother Bird - they keep changing their name!!!) to try the delectable looking Raspberry Burst ($15). Totally in love. The watermelon softee is icy and refreshingly sweet - perfect on a hot day. It\'s also very light, which gives you enough for the statement pieces: the deep fried mochi balls. Hot, dusted with a pinch of powdered sugar, it opens to release a gush of raspberry filling. You\'d think it\'d be sour, but it\'s sweet, a comforting flow of thick raspberry coolis with rosewater - almost like Bandung! The Mochi casing complemented it, was chewy and satisfying  in its sweetness. I felt the macaroons were a little redundant, but they did add beautiful colour. Under it all, was a light base of almond crunch, homemade with some waffle-cone biscuits (or something similar) and almond bits. Back to Pokemon catching guys, I caught a Snorlex yesterday, but damn lame, only 232 CP -_- @statelandcafe
Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto: have to admit I ordered this with a whole lotta suspicion and expected the worst. Premature feelings that we found out was unwarranted and miles away from the truth the moment we took a bite. Creamy, coconutty, al-dente rice ✔️ tender poached chicken (skinless thank God) ✔️ spicy and tangy chili sauce ✔️ with that sweet soy-ish sauce, I\'d call this more of a soy sauce chicken rice — though for its insane flavours I\'m really not complaining. Call it whatever you\'d like! Thing is, it\'s not just the main ingredients that executed well — the thought behind each component is also worth a mention. The crunchy blanched bok choy for offered a textural difference and a lighter, neutral flavour. The winner for me though has to be the liberal topping of fried shallots. Sweet, crisp, mellow, earthy, just super yummy. 
Without doubt the single most surprising dish I\'ve had of late. I\'m no fan of mentaiko so I didn\'t expect to like this at all; but suffice to say I finished the entire bowl on my own. Stateland did two things right with this Mentaiko Aglio Olio: first off, the aglio olio olive oil and chili base gave the pasta a nice kick, preventing the cream from getting to you halfway into it; secondly, there was way more mentaiko than there was mayo/cream, so the flavours were more intense and less jelak. Never thought I\'d say this, but I think I\'m a mentaiko pasta convert. #Burpproved
The waffle was quite well done - fluffy outside with a nice crisp outer layer. The portion of ice cream was just right, providing sufficient \'wetness\' to compliment the waffle. 
What I really love about this dish are the textures and flavours that each component brings to the dish. The sweetness from the corn, the tangyness from the tomatoes and lemon vinaigrette and the saltiness from the tobiko come together in a harmonious medley that really makes this simple salad shine. The salmon was cooked perfectly - soft, flaky and still slightly pink in the centre. Not too filling, so it\'s a good dinner option. 
special shoutout to the lovely girl at the counter!! because my friend and i couldn\'t make up our minds whether to get the matcha or earl grey set; thanks so much for surprising us with the extra earl grey mochi (FOC!!) so that we could try both ♡
Yup. I know what it looks like. But it is delicious! Sweet and slight savoury taste. Salted caramel? Or caramel with peanut? on the chewy mochi waffle like donut. Rich soft serve on top. Will go back for more. It is called Signature for a reason.
Signature rice doughnut served with cookie butter soft serve ice cream. The freshly fried rice doughnut was served hot from the fryer and complimented the cold ice cream really well. Since it\'s a rice doughnut, the exterior is slightly crispier than the average doughnut l while the inside has a gooey, chewy texture - incredibly delicious especially when paired with the cookie butter ice cream. The ice cream was soft, creamy, and not icy at all - although you gotta eat this fast as the heat from the doughnut melts it rather quickly. Then again, it\'s unlikely that this will stay on the table for long.
I felt that this was a valiant attempt to incorporate local flavours into a foreign dish that ultimately falls short since as a whole the dish still tastes like normal chicken rice, but doesn\'t actually taste better. The rice has the typical risotto texture - sticky and a lot more al dente than normal chicken rice. Other than that, the flavours are very much what you would expect from chicken rice - you can\'t help but think that you\'re paying more just for risotto rice (which isn\'t worth it imo). The chicken was quite normal and I think some chicken rice stalls have more tender and tastier chicken. The fried chicken skin wasn\'t crispy as well. Some plus points would be the soy sauce base which is slightly sweeter with a much stronger flavour than the usual chicken rice, and the chilli which is pretty authentic with quite a bit of kick. As a whole, I would still go for normal chicken rice than pay for a fancier version which doesn\'t live up to the original. 
Liu Sha [S$15] fried rice-balls, salted egg yolk custard filled mochi donuts with cookie butter soft serve (speculoos) and the Signature Rice Donut [S$14] warm chewy glazed donut with almond nuts, chestnut cream, kinako powder, very crisp and topped with Speculoos soft serve.
Place had an \"industrial underground\" feel that was too dark and cramped for my liking. Service was definitely lacking, maybe that\'s why they don\'t charge for it. But I thought they could be better trained than to smoke right outside the door which brought cigarette stench into the place.\n<br />Food took almost 30 mins to arrive, although every other table was just having dessert. Ordered the Mentaiko Aglio olio. Taste-wise this couldn\'t go wrong, although it got a little jelak after a few mouthfuls. Also had the Beef brisket bowl which was a Japanese rice risotto that was a tad sticky in texture. Overall, I thought the food here tend to be heavy in taste, perhaps more popular with the young. \n<br />Sorry but this place didn\'t fare well on my list as I couldn\'t enjoy the meal in terms of food and comfort. Fortunately their adjoining Brother Bird dessert is still drawing in crowds. #burpple
Loved the hazelnut layer topped with pistachios on the crispy charcoal toast. However, I recommend it to shared between more people as it\'s abit dry.
any drink for lunch).\n<br />An interesting take on chicken rice, we enjoyed the flavours of this dish and the contrast of textures between the risotto, soy marinated chicken and fried shallots.\n<br />Available at Stateland Cafe/Brother Bird @ 32 Bali Lane.\n<br />#StatelandCafe #BrotherBirdSG
While I thought it wouldn\'t be as promising as it sounded as it looked so wet, this actually tasted REALLY good. Like chicken rice but with far MORE juicy and tender meat and flavorful broth. I cannot. I want MORE.
The cookie butter soft serve tasted as if the ubiquitous llaollao cookie sauce took a luxurious and queenly milk bath, while the mochi donuts were an intriguingly doughy and ricey chew, with their respective flavour bursts spurting out explosively with the rude velocity of those showy engine zhng-ed cars zooming around town at 2am on Saturday nights. The salted egg filling was sufficiently rich, while elsewhere the raspberry jammed with its band and the white chocolate matcha\'s bitterness was tempered by an enthusiastic Taiwan salesgirl-esque sweetness. Sharing is a must unless you want to look like the Michelin man and feel like a Michelin tire. 3.8/5
Went over today coz wife wana have some dessert, sat at one of the only 2 outdoor tables. Wave to the waitresses in the shop... everybody was busy. Decided to enter the shop and order from the counter.. den realised need to pay after order. Oh! Didn\'t realise that.
Second visit within one week, this time tried the red velvet waffles ($15). Fluffy waffles with chocolate inside and cream cheese glazing outside with a scoop of ice cream. Sinful but worth the calories 😋
The hainanese chicken risotto ($20) was a good concept but execution was lackluster. Still worth a try though!!\n<br />Quote \"cynthaii\" on the @holler.out app to get 10% off your total bill when you spend a minimum of $55! (This meal costs us $65, so you can definitely hit that amount 😌)
Creamy and savoury but not jelak at all..\n<br />Wiped the bowl clean in minutes..
A fried dough ball over mochi stuffed with liu Sha that oozes out at first bite. The liusha, made of salted egg yolk and custard was just sweet enough. Couple that with cookie butter soft serve and we have a winner that\'s worth the 5km run.  Accompanying the already perfect dish were raspberry bits for a lil fun.
Chicken rice risotto was interesting, tasted a little like the chicken rice porridge you can buy from chicken rice shops. $20 nett for a main and a drink (many to choose from!) which is very decent for cafe dining! 
Honestly pretty good. Charcoal powder doesn\'t have a taste and doesn\'t do much other than blacken whatever it\'s in.. But i swear it almost adds a slight smokiness. Toast was fluffy on the inside but super crispy on the outside 😍
One of the new additions to Stateland\'s revamped menu (the menu consist of more bistro-like fare than cafe offerings), the Eggette comes served with a Homemade Chocolate Sorbet and Orange Segments alongside other sliced fruits such as strawberry and blueberries. Eggette was crisp, but puffy on the holes with a hint of citrus-sy zing in the batter, while the berries add a tart flavour to the dessert. Homemade chocolate sorbet is a little icy, though no particularly disturbing, and carried a tinge of sweetness; good for those who do not really fancy chocolate which can be too thick. A little bit pricey at $16 though.
Pictured here is the duck confit burger with a charcoal bun, mentaiko spaghetti with black tiger prawns, and my fav of the night - the 40 degree salmon! 😋
炭• charcoal toast was the spot on kind of crispy exterior and soft and buttery interior. Well paired with toasted liquid marshmallows, pistachios, coconut ice cream and salted caramel sauce. 
Flavourful toast, but tad dry in the parts which was not drizzled with honey. Crispy on the outside, soft in the inside with butter infused within.
Use to be one of the many cafes that serve taster  waffles but seems like it has dropped, due to lack of taste 
Not worth the price for this waffle. The waffle is nice and crunchy but lacks in taste. Cream cheese was okay and topped off with normal vanilla ice cream.
S\'more waffle with chocolate ice cream filled with nuts and biscuit....
Must try - Charcoal toast with ice cream filled with pistachios and salted caramel...
Kyoto $16.90, black sesame yeasted waffle, topped with matcha ice cream, red bean purée, rice cakes &amp; pink tuiles. Interesting combi 😋 // The tragedy of taking food pics in the night.
TAN (碳) - Charcoal honey toast topped with coconut ice cream, walnuts, pistachios, melted marshmallows and salted caramel.
❌\n<br />Charcoal Toast✔\n<br />New Awesome crispy and fluffy combination with coconut ice-cream. 😀👍
I wanted to try their matcha thick toast today but it was unavailable ): So we had the breakfast set and waffles instead. And I\'m glad to say that the red velvet waffles has improved since the previous time I had it and was quite amazed when I realised that the pink kisses were actually meringues!! 
Unfortunately, this was a case of the food looking a lot better than it tastes. Although the intensity of matcha was decent and the matcha granola topping was quite yummy, the texture of the thick toast itself was much too dry. I guess the amount of honey, butter and ice-cream didn\'t manage to strike the right balance with the toast. I think I shall stick to ordering their Classic Honey Toast from now on.
These days, it seems a classic eggs ben isn\'t enough to cut it with discerning cafehoppers. More is needed to impress. An example is Stateland\'s take that incorporates a local element of laksa. In my opinion, it works, albeit turning out to be much smaller than I expected. The \"eggporn\" money shot didn\'t happen though as the egg in my order was a tad overcooked. Sigh... But regardless, the yummy, slightly sweet laksa sauce made up for it somewhat.
Generally crispy over at certain areas and not, this one was just average tasting overall. Really liked the coconut ice cream that came over with the toast though, that tasted really nice.
Really yummy! Yeasted waffles were topped with beautifully caramelized bananas, walnuts, vanilla ice-cream, delicate shards of burnt sugar, and a side of maple syrup. Waffles weren\'t as fluffy as I\'d have liked them, but they were light and crisp.
Waffles topped with lemon curd, meringue, vanilla ice-cream and slivers of lemon rind. This had good robust zesty flavours that balanced the sweetness of the meringue. Really refreshing after a heavy meal too!
They ran out of red velvet waffle at 3pm on a Monday?! #disappointed #ununununbelievable #burpple
For an anti-waffle fan, this red velvet waffle is really my type of waffle- crisp on the outside and not too moist on the inside. Combined with the lemon cream cheese frosting and pink meringue kisses and topped with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream adds different flavour to every bite you take. The ice cream especially complemented well with the waffle, softening its crisp texture but not to the extent that it becomes soggy.
This is the Cookie Butter ($5.50) soft serve, 200ml of speculoos soft serve, sea salt and almond crunch. YUM YUM. For a lighter option, you guys could go for the honeydew sago, which is served with coconut soft serve, really refreshing too!
The waffle was crispy on the outside and rather limp on the inside while the lemon meringue concept and ensemble cast somehow felt a bit $1.99 Shop-esque, from the stick meringue that clings to your teeth for dear life to the sweet lemon curd that increasingly and curiously evoked olfactory images of working at construction sites or painting your nails. 3.2/5 
Not only delicious but also instagrammy 😍 Black sesame yeasted waffles with matcha ice cream, red bean &amp; rice cakes 😘 Waffles was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.. Matcha and Red bean blends perfectly well with the black waffles 👍 Quick pay a visit to \"Stateland Cafe\" whom is popular for their waffles !!
First time at Stateland and I freaking love the crispy texture of the toast!! 🍞🍞🍞 Except that it seemed to have been drenched in sugar and honey 🍯 with every bite I ate. Super overkill with the sweetness 😱😱😱 Would have loved more of the toasted nuts too to balance it out 😱😱😱
Even the waffles standards differs from my previous visit. \n<br />Adding on, it totally ruined my visit the other day, when I was notified that 2 out of 3 dishes I\'ve ordered are sold out after making payments approx 15mins ago. It\'s either the inconsistency and/or it\'s just my luck. \n<br />Thankfully the savoury dishes still satisfies.
The weekends are finally here! Head out and smell the fresh air (or feel the humid weather). After a not-so-positive experience from visiting Stateland Cafe the previous time (due to burnt and bitter blackforest waffles) I was back here again to try the (TAN) 炭 ($14.90) which is a butter &amp; honey baked charcoal pain de mie that has coconut ice cream, liquid marshmallow, salted caramel and toasted nuts. With all the sugar that was used to make this plate of dessert, it was a bit difficult to finish it towards the end. If I ever needed a sugar rush, perhaps a can of Coca Cola will be a better alternative. There is definitely room for improvement and it can start from reducing the excessive usage of sugary items.

Butter and honey baked matcha pain de mie, matcha ice cream, granola and rice balls. It\'s probably a bad toast(thurs)day because this is as hard as a rock. 😪
No, they are not serving you a charcoal, even though it is really charred and black based on its sexy appearance. newly added to their dessert menu, TAN is a charcoal toast with marshmallow filling, salted caramel and coconut ice cream. \n<br />texture was kinda hard though it was fluffy within the toast. just one conclusion - it was WAY TOO SWEET. salted caramel sauce was really thick and I felt as though the toast was drenched and coated with sugar with every bite. perhaps a good alternative for sweet-tooth fans! \n<br />wads with the weather anyway? can\'t stand the heat 😓
Picture may vary because they are still R&amp;Ding on their presentation.
The black charcoal honey toast is topped with liquid marshmallow, homemade coconut ice cream and salted caramel toasted almonds. It is crispy with a chewy texture due to the malt sugar drizzled over it, but it is too sweet for us! I think I will get diabetes having it alone myself!
It was quite a disappointing experience. Was really looking forward to having a nice dessert especially having read so many reviews about their signature red velvet waffle. However, both my friend and I agreed that the waffle don\'t really have the taste of the red velvet and it was quite bland. The cream cheese and the chocolate sprinkle on top of the waffles add to the taste, otherwise it\'ll be a really bland waffle. Won\'t really come back for their waffles but may be back for their toast.  ☺
Aglio Olio with mentaiko sauce 》$13.90
Really impressed with the homemade pain de mie - lovely crust with a slight drizzle of honey that complemented the fragrant buttery bread. The sweetness of the warm toast paired well with the coolness of the slightly tangy yogurt ice cream - which tasted like a crossover of Yakult and Greek yougurt. If only they used fresh berries - it wouldn\'t have been so dreadfully sour and mushy. Still, I would want this for breakfast everyday. 
Had very high expectation of my S\'mores waffles. \n<br />Unfortunately, the waffles tasted extremely sour on 1st bite and I had to refund it. I still can\'t wash down the sourish taste after multiple glurps of water. 😢
this was REALLY good. if you ever do come here, you have to try this. the waffles were rather dry... wouldn\'t go back for the waffles but will definitely go back the the thick honey toasts! 
Hadn\'t been here for very long and nice to see them having so many new menu items. Classic Honey Toast comes with berry compote and Vanilla Ice-Cream; crusty and sweet from the honey which hides in between the toast! A delightful sweet treat, though I wished it was less rough on the edges as my gums were cut a fair bit while having it.
.\n<br />|\n<br />The frozen yogurt and warm honey toast. It tasted much healthier than the one at afteryou Bangkok. Not a bad eat.
Topped with homemade ice cream, maple syrup and berries, the Classic Waffle ($11.90) was fluffy and light. 
I seem to have an affinity to Red Velvet waffles, nothing but praise for this heavenly tasting thick yet fluffy waffles! Not to forget the cream cheese which perfectly complements with the red Velvet base I\'m in love!!! \n<br />Definitely MUST TRY if you\'re in the bugis area! Portions are pretty generous so if you\'re only feeling a lil peckish, it\'s good to share with a friend or two!
The waffles were just right and even better when topped with the dark chocolate sauce and ice cream. 
RED VELVET WAFFLES *SLAY* hands down, best red velvet waffles ive ever tasted. the cream cheese together with the red velvet waffles was really a good combination! to add on the plate, chocolate sauce was good. sum it all, best red velvet waffles ever!!!!
Unexpectedly this experimentally named dish was great!! Hollandaise sauce is their original, laksa hinted but rather sweet, and nicely flavored. Their home made bread was also great!! I would like to take my friends here next time. This fish costed S$14.90 nett.
It\'s been a while since I had Stateland Cafe\'s Classic Honey Toast. Nice to know it is still as delightful as ever. That thick and creamy homemade yogurt ice-cream still goes like a dream with the crunchy-on-the-outside, buttered-up pillow of a Pain de Mie bread. Coupled with just the right amount of sweet honey and berries, this is clearly a dish that\'s been assembled with care and good taste in my opinion.  
But it makes my tastebuds \'party\' together! 💃😋 Love how well the Yoghurt Icecream complements the berries &amp; how perfectly the toast was made to such sweet crisp! 😋
Scrambled eggs served on toasted brioche with pork sausages, bacon, home-made tomato chilli jam and stewed mushrooms 》$17.90
In love with their unique twist of egg benedict;) The creamy, thick  Laksa gravy that replaced the usually-used hollandaise sauce in egg benedicts was not too overpowering and just nice. Highly recommended.  The waffle was amazing too😃
One of the best chocolate waffle I\'ve tried so far!!! I always like my waffle with plenty of fruits hence I have asked for extra blueberries (with some extra cost). But it\'s worth it! Crispy and fluffy and its chocolate!!! Small, cozy place to catch up with friends.
Red velvet and S\'mores waffle was really good. The waffles weren\'t too sweet either. Each of the waffle came with ice cream and most of the sweetness came from the ice cream and the toppings which didn\'t make me feel like I was gonna get diabetes. 
I found the Toffee Nut yeast-raised waffle too sour on this visit. Unfortunately, this affected the overall taste experience somewhat. I\'d definitely recommend the S\'mores waffle over this. It is a whole lot better with a strong chocolate taste that should please most people.
Yeast-raised waffles sure sound good to me - and yes, that IS cream cheese generously slathered on red velvet waffles. What a way to ring in the new year.
It\'s not as crispy as I would like it to be, but most probably becos of the chocolate fillings inside the waffle. If u like your dessert sweet then this is for u, with the chocolate fillings and cream cheese on it, it\'s sweetness is X 4 times! ($14.90) 
Thick-cut toast baked with honey and salted butter, served with fresh fruits and honey yogurt ice cream. Not too overly sweet! Perfect for me! Taste awesome with the fresh fruits! A must try! 
Strangely, the sliced Granny Smith apples mentioned in the menu were M.I.A. but the other components, namely homemade banana bread, peanut butter, crumble and ice-cream made it to the plate. There was also a surprise appearance put in by a lovely berry compote.\n<br />If you have tried all the variations of waffles Stateland Cafe is known for and are itching for something new, this is something you can consider. The ice-cream\'s not the creamiest but the banana bread\'s fresh and fragrant. I just wish it\'s served as one thick, hefty piece rather than two thin slices. 
Their aglio olio pasta is as mouthwatering as ever with copious amounts of garlic and chilli flakes but taking it up a level is a big dollop of torched \"mentaiko\" sauce. This thick, mayo-like topping is completely saturated with marinated pollock and cod roe, adding a luscious, savoury creaminess to every bite of the pasta. I like how a squirt of fresh lemon juice brightens the flavour mix further. Thumbs up for yumminess!
Superb. Slightly strong onion/garlic taste in the sauce. Me like it!
It was supposed to be vanilla ice cream but they ran out of it :( The waffle was too airy for my liking but somehow it went very well with the ice cream. The ice cream made the waffle a little addictive somehow!
Wanted to try honeycomb. We reached there at 925pm and they said they were closed. But we bumped into Cheryl (one of the owners?) who apologised to us and invited us to head to stateland instead. And actually offered us free drinks. Where to find such good service and such nice people!? 😱 I must say their toffee nut latte wins starbuck\'s hands down! Not overly sweet and do not mask the coffee taste!
Dark chocolate waffle with toasted marshmallow, chocolate sauce and biscuits. Serve with a scoop of belgium chocolate gelato. Very chocolatey dish. In fact, i’m overwhelm with chocolates. The chocolate taste and aroma just burst in your mouth once you bite into the waffle. The toasted marshmallow is really good too, instant melt in your mouth. The belgium chocolate is rich, creamy and smooth. Has a slight bitter cocoa note at the end. But it’s almost impossible to finish it on your own, its good for sharing, as you’ll get sick of it after eating too much as the chocolate is too overpowering.
Love their nutella toast with ice cream. AWESOME! Their price is reasonable as well! Do try it out! 
Pros: free water. quite a no of seats. Open till midnight\n<br />Cons: waffles were too bland &amp; spongy. Earl Grey Babycino not fragrant enough\n<br />Verdict: probably not coming back
And the honeycomb fad continues.... This time with a jab of honey ecstasy! The milky soft serve is fully milk flavour that is not sweet so as to pull out the sweetness of the honey for a price of $5!
Ordered the blackforest waffle at Stateland Cafe and the wafes were soft and not crisp at all and barely any taste of chocolate. Service was quite bad despite the fact that the cafe wasn\'t crowded at all when I went. 
After seeing fellow burppler\'s @wendolyn post, gotta try this! Honeycomb! So exciting! However this came, the look of the honeycomb was abit disappointing plus super sour raspberries! But the ice cream and honeycomb was good. I just didn\'t take liking to the yeast taste of the waffles.
They say good things come in pairs..... So here\'s the waffle version of this week\'s special!!! Same rules apply! Only available this Friday to Sunday (17-19 Oct) at $11.90! #needisaymore #comeandtryforyourself
Pain de mie baked with honey and salted butter, topped with handmade apple &amp; cinnamon granola and a scoop of honey yogurt gelato, finished off with a chunk of honeycomb! 
Decided to go simple by ordering their most basic waffle of all! Crispy waffles, topped with a dollop of simple rich vanilla ice cream, and a dash of mixed berries! Sounds boring, but you can never go wrong with waffles. If the waffles is good, anything added on, will only make it better. Not bad, for a start. And they even have Red Velvet or S\'mores Waffles for you adventurous people out there! Yumsss. 
The toast was crispy and sweet but balanced off with the slightly sour berries and awesome yogurt gelato! 👍😙\n<br />(P/S: And I didn\'t have to pay a single cent for it hehe.)\n<br />#burpple
The cream cheese compliment the red velvet so well and with the ice cream it\'s just heavenly! 
The honey yogurt gelato complemented very well with the warm thick toast which was baked with honey and salted butter! Sweetness was very well-balanced! You can always dizzle more honey (served on the side) if you want it sweeter!
Red chocolate waffles topped with cream cheese sauce, really dark chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. IMHO, really gelat and not as good as the one from oblong. 
IMHO, I feel the savory ones are better than the sweet ones! This egg, cream and bacon really goes well with the maple syrup and waffles. I\'m a fan!!! Hahaha  
Hands up all those who love peanut butter 🙋 Hands up all those who love chocolate ice-cream 🙋 Now that you have both hands in the air, wave them around for this worthy 2-in-1 creation!  \n<br />The toasted, buttered and honeyed \"pan de mie\" bread is slathered with a layer of peanut butter before a giant ball of rich Belgian chocolate ice-cream is plonked on top. And if all that isn\'t sweet enough for you, there\'s a jug of maple syrup to turbo-rise your sugar rush. Get ready to dance on the ceiling!
I think it is clever of them to make the dark chocolate waffle less sweet. This keeps the sweetness level in check when the toppings of toasted marshmallows (a.k.a. S\'mores), graham cookies and Belgian chocolate ice-cream are introduced.\n<br />The way I see it, this waffle concoction is more sophisticated in taste than its name suggests. Altogether, a very lovely indulgence.
Totally in lurrrrve with the more-ish flavours of this aglio olio! Because time has been taken to cook the chilli, garlic and bacon strips with the olive oil and pasta, this allows the aromatic, spicy flavours to seep deep within each strand of spagetti. I\'m not exaggerating when I say I can easily gobble two plates of this 😋
Check out that golden river of yolk flowing down between the crevice of just-as-golden hollandaise sauced-eggs. Such a gorgeous sight, isn\'t it? And yes, although the pair of poached eggs have to share the space of only one soft, fine-grained bread, its rather petite size doesn\'t detract from its yumminess.\n<br />Come to think of it, that\'s a smart move by Stateland Cafe because it means there will always be tummy space left for their famous waffles.
Love this more than the waffle that we ordered. Crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. ☺️👍 What are you having for lunch?
Always delicious, the Classic Honey Toast at Stateland Cafe never disappoints. It\'s not just beautiful to look at but so satisfying as well with its softness and crunch, warmth and cold, sweetness and slight tartness all blended together.
Diluted waffle mix with FROZEN raspberries not forgetting it\'s soggy and tasteless. I came all the way to try their waffle and I had only 1 bite and btw $14.90 for this is not cheap!! But I don\'t wish to waste my calories on something that are not worth it. Next stop.
Waffle was not too bad. It would have been good if the cream cheese drizzle was thicker such that it further compliments the waffle. 
(Had this some time ago)\n<br />Carbonara tasted just like any others but what really got me hooked on was the sweet savouries! I\'ve heard the red velvet waffles are great and I can\'t wait to try it :-)
it seem nothing has changed. I was all alone, with my bros, piled aside, stacked one on top of another. \n<br />and then you you came, you ripped me apart, you flattened me. you gave me a new lease of life. \n<br />yes i am now a table top. i now give a sort of peekture finish thats highly sought after. \n<br />yes, it was that day 8 feb 2012.
.
sticky  almost gooey like.  perched on crumbled digestive biscuits. the rich chocolate ice cream. what disappoints was de yeast tasted waffle. so good yet yearning for more
slightly blended. yes I need that little dose of caffeine.  just that little.
This is definitely for lovers of Nutella because it is a lot like their famous Classic Honey Toast but upgraded with everyone\'s favourite chocolate hazelnut spread. If you concentrate hard enough, you can still detect the honey and salted butter baked into the thick soft slice of Pain de Mie bread under all the Nutella. Also, instead of the honey yogurt gelato that\'s served with the Classic Honey Toast, this comes with vanilla gelato. So there is none of the light tartness found in the former that I personally like a lot.\n<br />In summary, this is good but my heart belongs to the Classic.
Well, it may look delicious but photo can be deceiving. &amp; bear in mind you need to wait for 40mins to be seated and another 40mins for food to arrive!
This waffles is a popular order among the patrons, it\'s no doubt a delectable dish! The waffles was crispy and covered in vanilla, the chocolate and red velvet complements each other so well.
It was a pleasant experience dining at Stateland Cafe after reading reviews from other tasters how fantastic was the waffles. It doesn\'t gives me the benefit of  doubt about the quality &amp; quantity, but it\'s surely has assured me the guaranteed plus chop worth paying waffles in town!
Who says a waffles place doesn\'t serve good coffee? It was a pleasant surprise that the coffee did balance out the sweetness from the waffles! I will be back for you again!
Crunchy, creamy, sweet and tangy - all in one plate. This much-lauded signature item of Stateland Cafe really is delightful. The toast is thick and crunchy, saturated just enough with a heavy drizzle of aromatic honey (there\'s more honey in a small jug for those who like it even sweeter). Balancing things off nicely is the yogurt ice-cream with its subtle tartness. Love the tiny bits of shaved chocolate and frozen raspberries, as they give bonus levels of flavour.
.\n<br /> 🎶⛄️\n<br />.
Decided to visit them again after they extended their unit next door. The first time I went, the waffles were disappointing. Tried the red velvet waffle this time and was better than before, not too dry like the previous one. Overall, it\'s good but not the best :)
A twist to the usual toast you\'d eat at a Yakun or Toast Box. This version is pretty good for a mid-day tea snack as it comes with ice cream, frozen berries and maple syrup! I\'m craving for some frozen berries now. 
The classic waffle satisfies my waffle cravings! Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, the perfect waffle! Topped with frozen berries, I\'m a happy girl! 
Chocolates gonna be very sweet? Nope, surprisingly it\'s a not-so-sweet treat that you won\'t get tired to finish the whole serving by yourself! ((:
Made with yeast, this chocolatey waffle has a bread-like quality, almost like a chocolate bun. What\'s yummy: the chocolate chips hidden in the waffle itself so there\'s an unexpected element of crunch. What\'s not: the rubbery marshmallows. Overall, I\'m not a huge fan and would much rather have their savoury waffle with scrambled eggs, bacon and cream or their amazeballs honey toast.
If I could wake up to something sweet, it\'d be this thick block of honeyed pain de mie with toasty surfaces and crisp edges, topped with yoghurt ice cream and fresh berries. Sooooooo goooooood. 
Don\'t really taste as nice as it look, pretty disappointed with it. Compared to the other waffles I had before. 😕
Not quite breakfast, not quite lunch, not quite teatime: it\'s the best of three worlds with scrambled eggs doused in onion-and-bacon cream sauce and served on a fluffy waffle. If you think the waffles here have a bread-like taste, that\'s because the batter is raised with yeast. 
French toast with additional honey yogurt ice cream. A little sweet - could ask for less berry compote and maple syrup. The overall taste would definitely be better 
Fresh toast served with berries and fresh cream drizzled with honey syrup 
Red velvet waffle. meh on its own,wow with ice cream and glaze.$14.90 
Because I have waffles shelved under the \"sweet desserts\" section of my brain, it required a real mental shift when I saw this on the menu: \"Eggs, Bacon and Cream Waffle\" ($14.90). However, it took only one bite for a smile to spread across my face. The already perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs was smothered under a tasty, rich and creamy sauce chockfull of bacon and onions. The chunks of mushroom which I had added for an extra $2, threw in a further \"meaty\" texture. Then, under all that was the light and crisp golden-coloured waffle. Every mouthful of this savoury goodness was bliss! It is also a dish that looked deceivingly modest but is enough for two people if their appetites aren\'t huge. 
Recommended by a colleague, the loveliness of this concoction surprised me. The earl grey tea aroma permeates the foam so you can inhale the fragrance even before your lips touch the cup for the first sip. I would even go as far to say I like it more than the coffees here.
Crunchy  red velvet waffles,  with choc syrup and vanilla ice cream.   Nice but not up to my expectation.   Overall is  good with environment/ music to go with the desserts.  
The bitterness of the waffle... The kaoness of the ice cream.. The melt-in mouth toasted marshmallow. 
Find out where you shouldn\'t eat this in my blog. Link at my profile :)
Poached eggs are perfectly done and I love the sweet toast beneath...
So-so eggs benny.... kinda disappointed :(
Finished in 5 mins to rush back to work!Cause foodie can\'t end a meal without desserts.the waffles are crispy  yet soft but has a bitter aftertaste.
I really like this one. It\'s so crispy at the sides and fluffy on the inside. Goes really well with the honey and Sour raspberries!
Not tryna boast but they seriously have one of the better red velvet waffles in town. Full of flavor yet it\'s not too sweet. Good for sharing though because it can get a bit filling 😉
I know it\'s really popular for its red velvet waffle, but I wanted to try their eggs benedict which was acclaimed as well. I LOVE that tomato chilli jam that they added around the brioche, such a unique flavour I can\'t describe, wished there were more! I added a pork sausage which was grilled nicely with a slightly candied exterior, and the mushrooms were tasty. Eggs were a little bit of a disappointment however because they didn\'t look like they were fresh and poached nicely, and the hollandaise was tasteless. I\'ll still give this a thumbs up though, that tomato jam was a winner. I liked their strawberry lemonade too. #burpple
Trying out a new cafe during lunchtime today. Away from the cbd crowd. 
Classic honey toast with additional ice cream 
With scrambled eggs. Mmhmm
Pretty pricey at $14.90, but packed with flakes of rich sweet dark chocolate, which worked very well with the fragrance of bread waffles, light cream cheese and vanilla ice cream. My only qualm was the waffles which weren\'t crispy enough, and if I may, a little soggy. 
Big breakfast with sunny side up 🌞🌞
very good. crispy and fluffy. the only downside is that you come out of the place smelling worst den being in a hawker centre.  improvements maybe?
can\'t complain about any of its ingredients and tasted wonderful with the mushroom sauce. certainly a 👍 to this place with good food and good service.
Stateland cafe is one of the newer cafe around town, but already gaining popularity. We ordered their red velvet waffles and eggs Benedict, which turns out to be average for the price. It\'s still a good place to check out for their other dishes, as well as for the ambience. 
Crispy, buttery thick cut toast with honey. Served with fresh berries and honey yogurt ice cream.
The first official Tea with Shai experience and it was a Red Velvet Waffle from Stateland Cafe that was a very light affair and the ice-cream went pretty well with it. Victoria got to experience this with me when I was first toying around with the idea of starting #teawithshai
Loved the place! Cozy but too tiny. Quite an extensive menu imo, don\'t mind heading back to try other stuff. 
$14.90, chocolate waffle with toasted marshmallows, Belgium chocolate ice cream topped with torched marshmallows. It\'s s\'mores, \'nuff said. (Not mine so just had a few bites. Waffles was fluffy and crispy on the sides pretty good)
$11.90, Crispy buttered thick toast (so soft inside!), with yoghurt ice cream topped with berries (slightly sour so it balances real well!!) honey on the side so you can decide on the sweetness yourself. SO. GOOD.
Red Velvet Waffle drizzled with cream cheese glaze and topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate flakes and raspberries. I have high expectations for waffles. To me, a good waffle must be crispy on the outside, light and fluffy inside. Stateland\'s version didn\'t make the mark YET.   Read reviews mentioning that their waffles are crispy but mine was not crispy plus a lil\' soggy inside. Cream cheese glaze was light, can\'t really taste the cream cheese. At $14.90, the waffle is on the high side considering that I can get better waffles at half the price elsewhere! PS: The waffle ain\'t bad, it\'s actually not bad but definitely didn\'t left an impression. The search for the best waffles in town continues... 
No coffee today, but I love the lemonade here (Mint lemonade and strawberry lemonade).  
=) enjoying the moment but the food portion too small for me! Mahahahaha.... Lol
...on a rainy day. // day 64 • #100happydays (caused i missed day 64 by accident. lol.)
The dish looked aesthetically pleasing, and it was topped with a generous serving of cheese. Personally I felt the waffle was not flavoursome enough, but the red velvet with chocolate and cheese and topped with icecream combo was amazing. The price of $14.90 was just slightly too expensive for me though. 
I like this because it\'s not excessively sweet like some others I\'ve tried.
Heard the french toast is good, so I went to get myself some. No regrets!  Hazelnut French toast was totally worth it!
Had some Aglio Olio , waffles with ice cream and of course...... French toast!
Hope you are all getting some well deserved rest! I\'m spending my day with Red Velvet Waffles and a really old friend at @statelandcafe #statelandcafe 👭
Absolutely disappointing. I honestly have no idea why there are so many good reviews (mostly 5 stars) of this place when the food is terrible. My friend and I shared a French toast and red velvet waffles. The French toast is totally tasteless. Not even a tinge of the fragrance of eggs. They drowned the 2 pieces of bread in extremely sweet blueberry sauce. The waffles were over done. They are super dry and hard on the outside and the interior of the waffles is pretty airy (so the waffle \"deflates\" when you poke through it). You just know that a waffle is not gonna be good when you have difficulty cutting through it. I couldn\'t taste the cream cheese because they gave too little. The vanilla ice cream is just average. The chocolate shavings didn\'t value add to the dish. We had to wait a while for the food which is okay but they didn\'t inform us that everything is self service so we were basically left hanging for a while. I will not recommend this place to anyone and I will definitely not return.
New post - Stateland Cafe, Bali Lane. More on jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg
We had Black Forest &amp; Classic waffle. It was decent but slightly dry for my liking 😊
Sank my teeth into the delicious crispy maple-flavoured waffles with perfectly roasted marshmallows topped with a scoop of chocolate ice-cream.
Salty and Sweet. Will prefer a stronger coffee! 
waffles were really good! had their S\'mores waffles!! thumbs up for waffles + ice cream! best dessert ever
Deep red waffle Flavoured with chocolate, topped with cream cheese glaze and vanilla ice cream S$14.90] - waffle lack of fragrance, we don\'t smell any trace of waffles from the kitchen(we were sitting fairly near to the kitchen). I still love Oblong\'s Red Velvet Waffles😍😍
Classic Waffles • The Classic Honey Toast w Yoghurt Ice-cream • Latte ☕️
Cinnamon French toast with blueberries, vanilla ice cream and almond flakes. It was done just right. It was not too sweet and the combination of warm toast with cold ice cream and slightly sweet berries with almonds was just perfect.
Served w a scoop of yoghurt. Well, i must say the toast is quite unique. A rare form a bread/toast here..
Okay. First try and im addicted to this. Its crisp on the exterior yet not too dense or moist on the insides. Gives nice crunch bites. It was supposed to have a hint of toffew nut but. I sensed none of that. Not that im bothered by the lack. :)
Freshly made only upon order, the waffle here is amazingly light while retaining a good crunch. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, syrup sauce, sweet blueberries and strawberries. 
The best seats in this venue are the pair of striped vintage chairs facing the cafe\'s glass frontage. As you indulge your caffeine craving, you are treated to a view of Bali Lane and the gamut of interesting folks who stroll by. 
Affordable prices. Waffles and egg Benedict taste so so. Worth trying honey toast. 
Not going to be able to do much of this very soon... so making a point to work out of as many cafés as I can (while I still can) the next several days! ;) No free wifi here, using my own USB dongle.
Hope it will be on the menu the next time i am there 😍😍😍 with @lynniekittyz
Buttered toast topped with poached eggs and ham with grilled tomatoes and stewed mushrooms aside. The eggs were runny and the hollandaise sauce was lightly flavoured. \n<br />There\'s something\'s unique about this Stateland Eggs Benedict, which I really enjoyed was the homemade jam. It was tangy and added a savoury flavor to the dish.
Classic waffle with gelato and fresh fruits. The waffle crust was crispy and the yogurt ice cream was really decadent. If only they can be more generous on the serving of ice cream and fruits, it would be perfect!
how to not enjoy with a belgium waffles with vanilla ice cream, fresh fruits and stateland\'s waffle sauce on your table?
a latte for the milker taste
a macchiato for the coffee seeker
The cafe\'s signature dessert. Crispy toasts that are well-complimented with with a drizzle of honey for sweetness. The Vanilla ice-cream adds a light finishing touch to the dessert.
Fairly decent with flowy eggs and buttery Hollandaise sauce though could do with better quality ham. Their homemade chili jam adds the unique flavour. Served with a side of stewed mushrooms
Papa Pahelta\'s blends used here. Despite using the Terra Firma blends, it seemed to lack the signature acidic taste and was rather neutral in its aroma.
One of the Statelanders menu, for the sweet tooth (French Toast) Thick griddled brioche with blueberry maple compote and fresh berries. \n<br />All day breakfast menu and pastas are also available.
Newest kid on the block, along the tiny road of Bali Lane. Coffee has a light flavor-saturated finish. The food at Stateland Coffee wins over the coffee.

Black sesame and matcha flavour are a classic combination that can hardly go wrong — and so are they in this rendition. We enjoyed whacking the chewy mochi donut, soaking in the black sesame ice cream and intense matcha glaze. Hopefully can squeeze some time to try their other special flavours for the upcoming weeks.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #dessert #food #matcha #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat
We wished they served the steak in an entire slab instead! And the best part of their brunch is that their prices are inclusive of drinks!
Mochi doughnut base is super yummy!! Matcha sauce is legit! Overall: definitely will come back for more 😂
This sounds damn quirky but it\'s damnnn good! $20 for this with a complimentary drink 😻, worth it!
😛 and they have a new brunch menu too!
And I\'m absolutely thrilled to know the Green Curry Donburi ($18 NETT with a complimentary non-alcoholic drink) is back! Do note they\'ve got NEW weekend brunch items that are available all day on Saturdays &amp; Sunday\'s too!

A unique twist to our favorite local dish. The chicken and garlic chili was spot on, but I thought the risotto grains and broth could have been more flavorful.\n<br />.\n<br />#asianfusion #chickenrice #statelandcafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm

Is this still on the menu? 🤔
Smores Waffle for $15

I need more of this. 🤤
Happy days deserves a dessert post dun you think so? Heehee! That said, the Cookie Butter Softserve from @brotherbirdsg\'s is what I live for but jokes aside, it\'s damn hiaking legit can. The soft serve itself is $6. To have it with 3 X Salted Egg York Bursts is $15 (yap they\'ve fixed the mochi bursts for now; after all salted egg is still their most popz)! However, my favorite way to have it is this; atop their Signature Mochi Donut ($14) which has been with @BrotherBirdSg since day 1. If you guys remember, Cookie Butter is their first soft serve flavor when @BrotherBirdSg just started up yah...\n<br />~\n<br />PS: @statelandcafe + @brotherbirdsg are the same entity housed withing the same unit with two floors uh!\n<br />~\n<br />Pic taken @statelandcafe @brotherbirdsg\n<br />32 Bali Lane\n<br />Singapore 189866\n<br />Reservations: 9296 4997\n<br />OR\n<br />Via @ChopeSg: http://www.chope.co/singapore-restaurants/restaurant/stateland-cafe\n<br />Operating Hours: Sun/Mon/Wed/Thu 12pm - 10pm\n<br />Fri/Sat 12pm - 12am\n<br />Closed: Tue \n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/statelandcafe\n<br />Email: statelandcafe@gmail.com\n<br />~

Especially love the radish that had absorbed all the goodness from the broth. And of course, the star was the extremely soft &amp; tasty beef cheeks\n<br />😋

A worthy reinvention of the classic dish with lingering notes of comfort akin to having \'chok\' or rice porridge. The poached chicken, smooth, juicy and chock full of the subtle flavors of soy
🤔
Taken on our first stop, @brotherbirdsg [@statelandcafe]. Beautiful, aren\'t they? Pleasing to the eye, and tastebuds. Too bad they\'re no longer serving taro ice cream [it\'s awesome] but yeah.. butter popcorn was pretty cool. Could be a bit bland eaten on it\'s own, but i guess that\'s what the cornflakes and popcorns are for. 😁 Can\'t wait to try their upcoming new donuts tho..!\n<br />-\n<br />🍦 Cookie Butter soft-serve [front] // Butter Popcorn soft-serve [back]\n<br />💰 S$6.00 each\n<br />🏠 @brotherbirdsg\n<br />📍 @statelandcafe / 32 Bali Lane, Singapore.\n<br />-\n<br />Ps.

The creamy and gooey dressing is tangy with a subtle spiciness and you will definitely relish the decadent tiger prawns drenched in the mentaiko sauce.
The pistachio bits sprinkled on the creamy vanilla ice cream provides a different texture that will appeal to nuts lovers
Matcha ice cream taste like jasmine green tea 
Nice place to chill and chit chat with friends. 
Love their honey yogurt ice cream!! 
Can resist ordering their #redvelvetwaffle One of the better red velvet waffle around. The taste of red velvet is very evident in the slight crispy #waffle but the cranberries are rather sour... #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife#cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeegram #coffeeholic#coffeelife #coffeelove #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram#sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #sgcafefood#instafood_sg #burpple #eatoutsg #podcult #statelandcafe

New on the menu is this charcoal thick toast from Stateland café! It is covered with melted marshmallows (yumz), pistachios &amp; walnuts and topped off with a scoop of ice-cream😍 Their toast was crispy and I can\'t wait to get back to try their matcha one already!
Found the base a bit too hard. You cannot go wrong with green tea but it was too sweet for my taste. It will go well with a black coffee but my latte was surprisingly bitter. So overall it looks good but I guess they have to work on flavour more. #whitagram #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #vscocam #vscosg

A black sesame flavored waffles. Toppings come with adzuki red bean puree, matcha ice cream, pink tuiles and a skewer of mochi with brown sugar syrup. Thumbs up!
Yummy~~~^^
Like the YOGURT very much with the crispy toast ^^
A bit over priced but taste is not bad
ITS SO GOOD!!

So rich that it motivated me back into the gym after a month of meds.
I think I still prefer their thick toasts.
I decided to try out their waffles offerings and got the Blackforest waffles whilst Bao got Laksa Eggs Benny. \n<br />Verdict on the waffles: This is not for the faint hearted. This is one helluva rich and decadent waffles I have ever had and I\'m still reeling from the sugar shock and richness of the chocolate. The cherry was nice and slightly made eating the waffles bearable. \n<br />#statelandcafe #waffles #blackforestwaffle #balilane #sgcafes #bugis #sgmakan #sgeats #burpple #adorraeats #chocolateoverdose #eggsbenedict #laksaeggsbenny #fatdieme #whatdiet

Honeycomb honeycomb honeycomb........ I think honeycomb is the up and coming next big thing 😍😍 There\'s so many honeycomb products/food coming up recently. Anyway, there\'s gonna be a F&amp;B festival called Nostalgia Lane this coming Saturday at Bali Lans (just beside Haji Lane) and stateland is having a small launch on their honeycomb ice cream 😍😍 you can have your choice of yogurt/milk soft serve topped with honey/ chocolate/caramel/ granola and finished with a honey chip (air flown from bee farms in Korea) (don\'t say good things never share) so yup! You know where to go this Saturday 😁
This place is heaven when it isn\'t crowded.
Nice setting
😌 Have a great day everyone!☺️
One of the better all-day breakfast on their list.
Who will say no to a Red Velvet &amp; Black Forest waffle?! 
The Belgian Chocolate ice cream served was rich and creamy, definitely not the usual King\'s/Wall\'s/Magnolia ice cream!

Impromptu meet up with the juniors over brunch. Had some Aglio Olio , waffles with ice cream and of course...... French toast!

No regrets!  Hazelnut French was totally worth it!

Delicious and chunky!  Perfect combo. #stateland #statelandcafe #balilane #bugis
No significant earl grey taste.

Waffle not as crispy and fluffy as preferred, but goes well with toppings. Original lemonade was great! Details: www.bitesbakesandstays.wordpress.com

Cheap &amp; good!
