â€¢\n<br />Haha. Seriously though, the lobster medallions were perfectly cooked and jam packed with flavor. But make sure you finish this quick because this got thick super-fast. Ideally grab a friend or two because it also can get hella jelat.  Aside from that, itâ€™s really a super bowl of risotto worth getting.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Big Shoutouts to @burpple and @bistroduvin for the invite and hospitality
However, the table went silent as we started digging in, a clear indicator of how good it was.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />The common theme about Bistro Du Vin is that everything is meant to be shared and this definitely was the case here.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Perfectly cooked beef and foie gras wrapped in filo pastry and served with Australian truffle sauce and root vegetables. The marriage of flavours was great and surprisingly wasnâ€™t as heavy as I envisioned it to be.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Definitely one of the best wellingtons Iâ€™ve had in Singapore. thanks @burpple for the invite and @bistroduvin for having all of us ^^
Sometimes duck confit can end up dry and unpleasant but there are occasions where you bite into the fat leg and you go literally sigh with approval. Bistro du vin does one that really fits the bill (HAHA no pun intended)\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Costing $32, it comes with ultra crispy skin and shred apart tender meat, its served with a side of salad and Sarladaise potatoes. The salad was pretty ordinary BUT THE SARLADAISE POTATOES! Fried with garlic and duck fat, they were so crispy but so light at the same time.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Ugh Iâ€™m this much closer to a heart attack but at least Iâ€™ll die happy.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Shout outs to the good folks at @burrple and @bistroduvin for the invite and hospitality
Delicate and moist Brittany sardines atop a warm, buttery and utterly flaky filo pastry base, served with a radicchio and tomato salad. This starter is not something you come across often even in French restaurants here and I can recommend it with utmost earnestness.
The Risotto de homard ($39) was served with a generous portion of chunky, succulent pieces of lobster tail atop a bed of risotto that was rich with the juices of the crustacean. We might\'ve spent a little too long on the photographs (although we did speed up already!) and the risotto became a tad too thick, but I felt that the flavour more than made up for the texture. Best for sharing as it could certainly get overwhelming, but despite how filling it was, I couldn\'t resist digging in for seconds &amp; even thirds!\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @bistroduvin for the fabulous evening and @burpple for extending the invite! #burpple #burppletastemaker
.\n<br />On to the food, this Bisque de homard ($20) was THE BEST #lobsterbisque I\'ve ever had. Chock full of pure #lobster flavour, it was sweet, savory and umami all at once. Also, what\'s different is that the condiments of rouille sauce, cheese and croutons are served on the side rather than in the soup itself, to allow diners to personalize their portion. Personally, I felt that the broth was satisfying enough without any extras, but I couldn\'t help but mop up the bowl with the croutons/bread, and not a drop was wasted ðŸ˜‹\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @bistroduvin for the delightful hospitality (special thanks to Philippe and Marissa) and @burpple for the invite! #burpple #burppletastemaker
Amongst all the mains, it looked the most ordinary on the menu.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />However, a bite later forced me to eat my words. The super creamy mashed potato paired with the decadently soft and flavorful braised beef cheek accented by the slight bite from the lardons and root vegetables was an explosion of flavor and texture.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />It was truly one of those dishes where you want to keep eating but you want to also eat slowly to prolong the amazing gastronomic experience.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />The caveat is that you HAVE to order this to share because it gets quite rich after a while. But more people also equates to more dishes being order so thatâ€™s isnâ€™t really a problem anymoreâ€¦.\n<br />â€¢\n<br />Thanks to @burpple and @bistroduvin for the invite and wonderful dining experience.
All you can ask from a chocolate lava cake is that it be rich, moist and molten in the middle when the knife goes through it. I\'m happy to say this more than delivers on all fronts and is incredibly delish in its sinfulness.
The tart is fantastically buttery, flaky and charred around the edges. Topped with a round of sweet caramelised apple slices, vanilla ice cream and lashings of butterscotch, this was a fine ending to a fabulous meal.
Not as runny as I would have liked it, but the luxuriant lobster flavour imbued in each spoonful more than made up for it. We were told the chef prefers a thicker consistency for his risottos and truth be told, we took our time before digging in, so this dish definitely warrants a second try in the future to be eaten whilst fresh. The richness and size of the portion will definitely prove overwhelming for one, so make sure you bring friends along to share.
The Corsica Lonzo loin pork chop played it coy, brandishing a rough, char-grilled countenance which concealed just barely blushing pink flesh within. Those faint of heart and averse to any hint of rawness, best stay clear. For the rest of us, this is some of the most succulent pork you\'ll ever taste.
I would swim in a pool of this -- fall-apart beef cheeks revelling in a bath of deep red wine sauce, mushrooms, carrots, shallots and all-important bacon,  served with pommes puree so silky they must have chucked a whole block of butter in it. I need the chef\'s grandma\'s recipe for this.
With bon vivant aspirations firmly in mind, I insisted upon ordering the decadent beef wellington, a decision that proved most fruitious once we tasted this magnificent beast.
Those opposed to lamb might very well change their minds after sinking their teeth into this ludicrously well cooked piece of meat. Tender, juicy and lacking any hint of gaminess, the game changer is the bacon stuffed in its center that helps keep the meat moist and imparts a most pleasant porcine flavour. Sauce is paramount in French cuisine, and the jus poured liberally over the meat is fantastic. Elsewhere, the velvety mash and soft flavours of ratatouille complement the hero of the dish perfectly.
Bistro Du Vin possesses a certain je ne sais quoi which takes me back to chilly autumn nights sat outdoors of a cosy bistro in the Jewish Quarter, sipping wine under the warm glow of street lamps as we take our time with a leisurely dinner.
Quintessential charcuterie board - smoked duck breast, homemade rillettes, ham &amp; saucisson. Meat for days.
Your eggs benedict has got nothing on this Burgundian classic. A runny soft boiled egg lounging insouciantly in a pool of rich red wine, onion, shallot and chicken stock sauce that\'s had its flavours blasted to even greater heights from the salty lardon bits bobbing in it. Crispy croutons break the monotony of the more toothless components and add a satisfyingly resounding crunch. C\'est Bon.
Two slabs of hapless foie gras quickly succumb to stabbing forks as we make short work of the superbly fatty force fed goose liver. A charismatic char is worn by this buttery beauty served with griottes sour cherry in Armagnac and moreish chicken jus. This could be my raison d\'Ãªtre.
A salty, meaty slab of goodness, the terrine is rusticly chunky in places and studded with hazelnuts. In my opinion, perfect bedfellows with some crusty bread and a swab of butter.

Nice surroundings.
plus my toddler is obsessed with foie gras, and this version with stewed apples and duck jus is excellent and large enough to share... #burpple #bistroduvin
I wish I\'d find a place who does one that\'d blow my Hat off.  I love it custard-like, light, creamy and just the right amount of whites.
I still prefer Hongkong style. #french #zion #foodporn #foodpic #foodsg #instafood #foodie #calories #suckling #pork #burpple
Warm and fluffy inside. There\'s a mandatory 20min wait to this dessert.
Loving this Brandade with a runny poached egg which is actually cod fish with mashed potato!

Braised beef cheek for the boy. @tribalzoid
