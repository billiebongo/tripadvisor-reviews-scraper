We got a chance to try LongQing\'s new range of sakes and man, is pairing sake with hotpot SHIOOOK! 😂
Another day, another \"soup-er\" satisfying round at LongQing.\n<br />On this visit with my parents, I chose the \"shark\'s fin melon herbal soup\" instead of the usual \"wild mushroom\" to pair with my must-have \"spicy mala\". And nope, not a single shark was harmed as this is a blend of pork bone and a melon with an internal texture that resembles shark\'s fin. \n<br />Supposedly boiled with 10 types of Chinese herbs, this cloudy soup has a touch of sweetness that is very pleasing. Everything tastes good cooked in it, especially the dried bamboo pith, crispy beancurd skin roll and handmade meatball.\n<br />Conclusion: It has just become officially harder for me to decide on which two soups to have here 😆
As I am quite fussy about what I dunk in my steamboat, I don\'t usually go for sets even if they give better value. Personally, I find it more satisfying to just head straight for the items I love. And at LongQing, these are what make the cut:\n<br />- U.S. 150 Days Aged Short Rib Chef\'s Cut (so buttery in the mouth!)\n<br />- luncheon meat (love, love, love the chunky meat texture of the brand they serve)\n<br />- crispy beancurd skin roll (flash soak these babies for shiok-ness)\n<br />- fish paste spread on crispy pork skin (springy and full of flavour)\n<br />- winter melon (throw them in at the start of the meal and forget about them till the end when they\'ve become sweet mushiness)\n<br />- watercress (I prefer to blanch this for literally 3 seconds to retain that fresh crispness)\n<br />- \"tang o\" (ditto)\n<br />- mushrooms (an assortment is always sure to please)
Really love the fresh ingredients for steamboat here (the tofu skin, luncheon meat, super tender Pork collar, Beef shirt Rib Slices and juicy dumplings!) Oh my, the pig liver was so good 🙃The mushroom base was great - till they added the chicken soup stock in without the mushroom Essence and the mala base was on the oilier side but super spicy and shiok! \n<br />Super affordable set menu for 6 at $180 (around $30+ per pax!) - that comes with premium pork collar and US short ribs! \n<br />Pro Tip: preorder the Crispy Taro Balls ($7.80) when you reserve your seats here - they sell out real fast!
Soup base are MSG free so be prepared to expect a lighter and more blend taste of their soup. If you\'re someone who is health conscious, this will be the place for you.
|\n<br />My foodie friends said their mala hot pot was epic. Their lobster hot pot offered a clean and lighter taste. The boss added large amount of clams for seasoning. At the end of the meal, the concentrated seafood flavor and they added in a bowl of rice and turned it into congee. 100% satisfaction for this epic meal. .\n<br />|\n<br />Do note that they will be opening over the Chinese New Year Holiday and remember to book in advance.
😝\n<br />🍴\n<br />Got a set B with rib eye slices, beef tendon and pork belly (which I switched from lamb), yammy vermicelli and a yuan yang soup (tomato/mushroom soup). Super fresh meat plus that self made fish paste! 👍🏻👍🏻 The tomato soup was a pleasant surprise! Instead of typical Chinese soup that\'s clear, with a mashed tomato. It\'s almost like Ang moh tomato soup with bay leaves and onions! 😋😋 The mushroom soup was super fragrant and filled w many different mushrooms that I\'ve never seen before 😂. 🍴\n<br />We definitely walked away w happy bellies.#burpple #hotpot #longqing
Sweater weather so \'tis the season for some steamboat! The owner, James, is passionate about what they serve and it shows - LongQing is a pretty young restaurant but they definitely know what they\'re doing with fresh, quality ingredients and tasty soup bases to choose from, all of which doesn\'t have any MSG (YAY!!)! 
The Premium Pot comes with fresh lobster, canadian scallop, live flower clam, fresh fish slice, fresh prawn, white cabbage, radish, enoki and shiitake mushroom. A layer of white cabbage and clams are lined at the bottom of the pot at the start to fully bring out its flavor into the broth, in preparation of having a porridge to be cooked towards the end of your meal.
At Long Qing, no msg is used as the sweet seafood broth is concocted using clams, cabbages and lobster shells. My favourite seafood here has to be the lobster which was one of the freshest I tasted (I had lobsters every week when I lived in Boston).\n<br />🔸\n<br />At its finale, you pour in a bowl of rice, soak it up with the broth further intensified through the seafood cooking, and eat it like a luxurious yet comforting seafood porridge.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is an invited tasting.
Devoid of loud, tacky signs, it\'s easy to miss this gem of a hotpot restaurant along Hong Kong Street. Within, LongQing oozes pretty hip vibes with sturdy wooden furniture and walls tattooed with paintings — this definitely isn\'t your typical Chinese mala hotpot joint! Bring your partner for an intimate dinner date and share one of the three hotpot set menus (from $55, serves two). Each set comes with a variety of meat and vegetables, along with a divided pot for two MSG-free broths. We recommend going for the concentrated wild mushroom broth and the classic spicy ma la. For a feast, also order the much raved about Luncheon Meat ($6.80), Potato Noodles ($3.80) and freshly fried Beancurd Skin Roll ($6.80), and save space for the super addictive Crispy Taro Ball ($7.80) for dessert! These crispy fritters surprise with a chewy, mochi-like yam paste (orh ni) centre!\n<br />Avg Price: $40 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Jean Kao
This Sichuan hotpot restaurant along Hong Kong Street is devoid of large, loud signs that scream \"I am from China!\". Instead, the borderline hipster restaurant is decked out in sturdy wooden furniture and comes complete with concrete walls tattooed with paintings. For an intimate dinner date, come with your partner and go straight for one of the three hotpot set menus (from $55, serves two). It comes with a divided bowl for two MSG-free broths, of which you should get wild mushrooms on one side — a trio of Chinese mushrooms boiled down to an incredible tasty concentrate — and spicy ma la on the other. The sets come with a variety of meats, vegetables and access to concocting your favourite dips at the sauce counter. Don\'t forget to order a round of the unbelievably delicious Luncheon Meat ($6.80), Potato Noodle ($3.80) and the freshly fried Beancurd Skin Roll ($6.80). Save space for the super addictive Crispy Taro Ball ($7.80) for dessert — chewy mochi-like dough fritters with a molten yam paste (orh ni) surprise centre!\n<br />Avg price: $40 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayson Yeo

B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />You wanna know how good these Crispy Taro Balls were? Well, despite feeling stuffed from the steamboat dinner tasting, most of us felt like we could do with a few more of these each! 😜\n<br />Made in small batches using sweet potato and flour, these golf ball-sized spheres were crunchy on the outside and ever so slightly chewy all over. Surprisingly, they weren\'t greasy at all and the smooth yam paste filling wasn\'t too sweet either.\n<br />My advice: Do allocate space in your belly for them.\n
Soup base are made from scratch and free of MSG, recommended to try the wild-mushroom and tomato soup base (better than Hai Di Lao for me) Value for money Chinese steamboat, but U.S. short rib [S$22+] which was the best beef in their menu didn\'t quite hit the mark for #sgwanderlust standard, and for me that\'s an important component. ⭐️Rating : 🌝🌝🌜\n<br />📍LongQing 隆庆\n<br />18 Hong Kong Street\n<br />🇸🇬Singapore 059661\n<br />🚗Parking [Coupon] along Hong Kong Street\n<br />⏰Opening Hours :\n<br />Tue to Sun : 5:30pm - 11:00pm\n<br />Closed on Mon
My mad love for ma la will probably never end but the search for the best ma la hotpot might just stop here at LongQing. (YES IT\'S REALLY GOOD) The soup base was extremely fragrant, less oily than others and had a very well balanced numbness and spiciness, while still customizable to your preference. The best part? Wait for it ... NO MSG! More than 20 herbs were used with some even sourced directly from Chong Qing to ensure quality. With 4 soup bases to choose from, I\'ll highly recommend the healthy yet tasty Wild Mushroom and of course, the Spicy Ma La. Both of which were so addictive I couldn\'t stop slurping them down.
Crisp chewy tapioca starch shell encasing two beautiful pastel hues of orange sweet potato and purple yam. Served warm, these mildly-sweetened glorious balls are guaranteed to satisfy ☺️ 7.8bucks/serve \n<br />#FTrecommends
Ahhhh, the comforts of conversation and chatter over a bubbling hotpot. ☺️ Long Qing is a new hotpot restaurant along Hong Kong street that had us alternating between dunking their fresh meats in their spicy mala and chugging their amazing mushroom soup.
\nThere is something intrinsically comforting about a big communal pot of dual simmering soups where you cook your choice of quality ingredients. And if the soups are made from scratch and MSG-free, even better! My recommended picks would be the fragrant wild mushroom ($14) and the very drinkable \"ma la\" ($14) that was much more broth than slick chilli oil. 
The other #BurppleTastemakers who went for the tasting a month ago have returned for more, one even up to her fourth visit by now!
We always order 2-3 portions haha!!

The only disappointment is that the Mushroom soup isn\'t as mushroomy as it used to be. 🤔 At least meat is still as fresh! 😋#burpple #hotpot #longqing #mala
Overall! Great experience, yummy broth which they claim... no msg. Not Too expensive too! ESP their lunch set.

Not for unhealthy people like us😅\n<br />#justsaying
Finally went to @longqingsingapore after a year of planning with my friends ! No MSG in the soup bases so it\'s the healthy version of steamboat. Soup bases are quite bland so if you\'re someone who prefer healthy kind of steamboat, you may want to give it a try!\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #bonappetit #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #10likes #beautifulcuisines #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #foodspotting #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #steamboat

.\n<br />Craving some steamy MSG free soup for a Friday night too? .\n<br />Food was slightly to the pricey side so I didn\'t order too much but the food quality was there. beef was fresh, and their meatballs are super different from other hotpot places! A must  have. .\n<br />I am a huge fan of soupy stuff and therefore I drank like 10 bowls in total of their mushroom &amp; mala soup base and cleared all the dishes we ordered. .\n<br />And the owner, James is very hospitable 😁👌\n<br />.\n<br />📍Long qing is located at 18 Hongkong street.\n<br />Closest MRT: clarkequay or Raffles Place .

The set also comes with canadian scallop, fish slices, fresh prawn, enoki and shiitake mushroom, adding to the sweetness of the broth. However, my favourites come from the a la carte: the (really value for money) Tsing Yi fish, with a nice chewy skin and soft flesh, and the thin slices of mangalica pork that had beautiful marbling and nice fat ratio. You only need to dip it into the pot for 1-2 minutes  and half a minute, respectively, so that they aren\'t overcooked. Another highlight was definitely the (Golden Boy) luncheon meat that has chunks of pork inside; who can resist spam in steamboat anyway?\n<br />*\n<br />Please note that Taste of Ocean set needs to be reserved at least one day in advance because the fresh ingredients are not always available in-stock.\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @longqingsingapore for the warm hospitality and thanks @burpple for extending the invite!\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #soup #food #meat #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat
