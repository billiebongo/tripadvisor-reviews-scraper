One of the latest dessert creations at Old Hen Kitchen — featuring elements such as Koicha, Vanilla Bean Ice-Cream and Speculoos Crumb, the Koicha (which itself is a thick matcha) is served on the side to be poured in before eating.
Something new here, this is perfect for those matcha purists who loves  deep, bitter profiles. Using Koicha, you\'re getting a thick, creamy pour over their vanilla bean ice cream.
Thin Beer-battered fish fillet that was rather soft on the inside, which breaks apart easily when you was slicing it. There are 2 types of sauces to enjoy the fillet - Tomato peach salsa and the usual, Tartar sauce. Generous serving of shoe-string fries and top-up $4 for the chilli crab sauce was the perfect match.
🍽: Beef Burger\n<br />•\n<br />Price: $15.00\n<br />•\n<br />📍: 172 Owen road 🚇: Farrer Park\n<br />•\n<br />Finally, Old hen coffee bar has expanded! Old hen kitchen is prepared to serve an extensive menu than it\'s mother store due to space constraint.\n<br />•\n<br />Sandwiched between the brioche bun, the 160g beef patty was indeed juicy by enhancing the flavour the Gochujang sauce is then spread on top of the patty thus adding the sweetness of the patty while giving it an extra tangly sensation. I just wish there were bits of onions mixed into the patty giving it extra crunchiness texture.\n<br />•\n<br />Even though after pan-frying the bun, there was still lack of crispy texture from it. The add-on truffle made me regretted not ordering the chilli crab fries instead as I could hardly taste any hint of truffle.
Back after such a long while — saw some new additions to their menu ever since my last (and only) visit here; wished I was here more than I should actually!
Omg boyfriend surprised me /w another bouquet of flowers 😍🌹 and brunch at Old Hen Kitchen! Only tried two dishes but they were both so yummy!! Fish &amp; Chips ($18): Beer battered halibut with tomato salsa &amp; top up of $4 for shoestring chili crab fries. // Salmon &amp; Soba ($19): sous vide salmon /w soba, snow pea, edamame, carrot, and red chili in peanut citrus teriyaki sauce! Plus Dark Cocoa ($6.50) and the new Matcha Milk ($7). Boyfriend\'s love: priceless!! @dareren 😘 #dqky #burpple
Armoured with a strong yet thin beer batter coat, the halibut fillet is so soft that it breaks apart easily in our mouths. 😋 There are different ways to enjoy this sweet and moist fish, with the traditional tartar sauce or the tangy and spicy tomato peach salsa or chilli crab sauce!! We topped up $4 for Chilli Crab Fries but requested to set aside the sauce for better enjoyment of the crispy shoestring fries. 😄
Matcha craze is never over for me. I made my way to Old Hen Kitchen specially for this Matcha Milk. Expect high milk content because this is latte (written in Japanese on the label). 😘 This will be popular with those who enjoy matcha flavours but not the bitterness. The milkiness significantly reduced the original bitter aftertaste which purists actually enjoy. 😁
(He\'s right for once, thank goodness 😂)\n<br />•\n<br />Loveeeeed the sous vide salmon for its fork-tender, flaky interior that belied a crispy, pan-seared skin beneath the scarlet flesh. It\'s so good! 😍\n<br />•\n<br />That citrus teriyaki sauce coating the soba noodles tasted a little similar to the one used in Yusheng - an addictive marriage of sweet, tangy and savoury notes.\n<br />•\n<br />P.S.: Special thanks to the super friendly waiter at Old Hen Coffee for guiding me to Old Hen Kitchen.
We decided to go with fish &amp; chips [$18] and topped [$4] to change the fries to chili crab fries 🤤 We did the right choice as the chili crab sauce was the bomb. We were actually dipping the fish with the chili crab sauce. 😋
Old Hen Coffee Bar has expanded, with a new concept just down the street called Old Hen Kitchen that focuses more on brunch options. The new space is significantly larger, and you have the option of pulling up a seat at the counter to watch them work their magic. We\'re so glad they\'ve brought over their popular cold brews and espresso-based coffees, with the addition of Japanese tea from Ippudo Tea Co, all great to sip on as you catch up with your friends. Share a side of Chili Crab Fries ($12) while you do so — it\'s saucy with pronounced bits of crab meat, and has a spicy kick! For mains, try the Salmon Soba ($19) — buckwheat noodles tossed in a citrus teriyaki sauce, topped with sous vide salmon, carrots, edamame and a sprinkle of ikura. Pro tip: Watch out for their newly launched cold brews like the Cold Matcha Milk and seasonal offerings like the Cold Peppermint Chocolate!\n<br />Avg Price: $30 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Alex Chua
Sweet, spicy and full of crabby meaty goodness. A must try if you\'re at the old hen kitchen!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #oldhenkitchen #burpple
Old Hen Kitchen serves up proper dine in menu with the in house kitchen, but with slightly pricey offerings such as this portobello aglio olio at a whopping $16. Not too shabby but can be better, of course. Would have loved it to be spicier!
There\'s always some days where you would crave for some good old Fish &amp; Chips ($19). Food at @oldhencoffee\'s new venture Old Hen Kitchen (127 Owen Road) are at Nett prices, so this might seemed on the pricer side but I felt that the quality of the fried fish really made it worth it. Super moist, fleshy halibut fish was used here and you could really taste the beer in the batter 😋 \n<br />It came interesting with refreshing salsa instead of the the usual tartar sauce and lots of shoestring fries. The additional of Chili Crab sauce was a special request of mine, or not usually it just comes with regular fries.
Comes originally with just normal fries — asked if we could have the chili crab fries with the Fish &amp; Chips and they obliged. Pretty decent overall; the halibut fillet was fried till golden brown, the exterior was crisp while the insides were flaky and creamy. Accompanying chips were crisp, but the chili crab sauce seemed to lack crustacean flavour though it still delivers a good moderate level of spiciness. 
Newly launched and available at both Old Hen Kitchen and Old Hen Coffee Bar is this Cold Matcha Milk that comes in the same bottles as their popular Cold Brew coffee. Matcha lovers would love these — rich green tea flavours in a creamy confront without any overwhelming sweetness or aftertastes. Definitely worth trying!
Old Hen Kitchen opens its doors for the first time today at 127 Owen Road, just a short distance away from their original store at 88 Rangon Road. Currently in soft launch phase, Old Hen Kitchen is only serving four items on the menu along with a selection of Japanese tea from Ippodo Tea Co., their popular Cold Brews as well as their latest Matcha Milk and espresso-based coffees pulled from blends by Nylon Coffee Roasters and Heart Roasters.

What\'s your fav Chilli crab sauced dish?
I rarely say that anything is \'#perfect\', because nothing is really... but this was as close as it gets. And... #addicted to #noodles much someone? 😆 #yummy #weekend #yestergram #brunch #soba #sgcafe #foodpics #noodleporn #burpple
Was initially concerned  how \"green\" the dish was, with an overload of avocado and guacamole, but those fears were unfounded. With a touch of lemon juice, the dish came alive with a nice tangy burst. Beneath the bellies of sliced avocados were chopped bits of cashew and sunflower seed that gave it the nice nutty crunch flavor. Paired with the perfectly soft boiled egg with runny yolk.\n<br />.\n<br />#matcha #oldhenkitchen #avocado #oldhen #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm

Also, got my hands on the Cold Matcha Milk [$7], something a milky lover would fancy.

😩 Massive PASTA CRAVINGS right now.
Known for its cold brews, Old Hen has an awesome atmosphere to chill in. The hype over this bottle of green probably elavated my expectations, so it was kinda underwhelming. But anyhow, worth a try esp for those who love a gao gao matcha taste :&gt; Gonna stick to hot matcha lattes the next time though but will come back to try the mains and food! \n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #matcha #matchamilk #oldhenkitchen #sgfood #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #igsg #whatidrank #matchafix
