😍 Nom nom nommmm. Best thing? It opens from 6pm to 4am! Hurrays to sashimi after shift! Oh! They\'re having a promotion for their sapporo beer @ $3.90/ bottle now! \n<br />#sashimi #affordable #burpple
1) Chirashi $23\n<br />2) Bara Chirashi $13.80\n<br />3) Aburi Bara Chirashi $16.80\n<br />.\n<br />@barashitei opens till late night daily from 11am-3pm/6pm-4am. Brunch, dinner or supper also okaiez! 👌🏼
.\n<br />At $13.80 for Bara Chirashi or $23 for Chirashi, all the freshness 🐟 in a bowl be it salmon, tuna or yellow tail definitely gives sashimi lovers a run for their money.\n<br />.\n<br />Also not forgetting the Kurama Ebi [$7.80] which turned out to be a crowd pleaser with its garlicky sauce on seared prawns.
Affordable and tasty jap food open till 4am?! Whats more, their beer are having promo at $3.80+ per bottle. Def going back for more. -M
Look no further! @Barashitei actually opens till 4am daily - imagine savouring their Spicy Salmon Maki (pictured - $12.80) after your midnight movie at The Cathay 😋
Who wants to waste calories on sucky food anyways, but I\'m glad my squad is always so honest and supportive 🙈As much as I enjoy eating alone, I love having lots of dishes to share. And so when there are 7 hungry people at a Japanese restaurant, who collectively believe that \"there\'s never enough of Japanese food\", there is a feast (and lots of gossips).
A mild tease from the spicy mentaiko sauce, Barashi-tei’s Spicy Salmon Maki ($12.80) consists of all my favourite ingredients. From the soft aburi salmon to the thinly battered ebi tempura, the maki definitely stole the show and was the best out of our dinner spread. Topped with ikura, the salmon was nicely torched creating a light smokey and creamy flavour while the fried prawn in the center gave a good crunch.

Complimentary baby octopus 🐙 served before our mains. Service here is fairly good &amp; the waitstaff are friendly &amp; attentive ☺
Spicy Salmon Maki ($12.80+) - smooth salmon slices with creamy mentaiko sauce. Ebi Tempura in the middle, served warm &amp; freshly made. Everything is in good proportion. I love this! 
A decent spread, though the portion size and price tag left much to be desired. The Bara Chirashi-don was pretty good and the Sirloin Steak Set ($16.80) was surprisingly well-executed. Comforting and light, the Gindara Nabe ($24) was flavourful with fresh ingredients used and a pleasant sweet stock base but definitely pricey as a sharing portion.
The crunchy tempura prawn was definitely the highlight. The spicy sauce was rather disappointing, lacking in flavour. I would have preferred a heavier tasting mentaiko sauce to make it creamier. But this is better compared to the avocado ebi maki!
The aburi salmon went perfectly well with the creamy mentaiko sauce that was generously slathered all over the maki. Salmon was very nicely torched - very smooth and melts in your mouth. The addition of fried ebi as the filling added a nice crunch to each bite. Just a personal gripe - the mentaiko could have been a little spicier to give it an extra kick! 
The sweet, light broth was good, with an underlying savouriness from the shoyu sauce. Fish was fresh with a similar taste and texture as cod fish. But I felt that the portion could have been more generous for $24++. 
Steak was tender, medium doneness, with an excellent Japanese demiglaze sauce. Set includes watermelon and miso soup. Quite worth it for $16.90++.
4.5 munchies: Slow-boiled for 3 hours and cooked with one whole gindara until the flavour from the bones infuses the broth, the natural sweetness of the stock only left me wanting for more. The Japan-imported mackerel was fresh and meaty; alongside other nabe ingredients including tofu, seaweed, and assorted Japanese mushrooms. If only I had some Japanese white rice to go with the flavourful broth!
At $23, I feel that the chirashi don from sushi bar is much more value due to the premium cuts of fish like the salmon belly and the hotate. The tuna I got was cut pretty poorly, too chunky and hard to chew 
Refreshing change to have the chopped up pieces lightly torched. Avocado provided a different texture and taste to the bowl! Rice was slightly on the salty side due to the amount of sauce used
The quest to find a good maki will never end. While we are regulars at Koh Grill and The Sushi Bar, we enjoyed Barashi Tei\'s Spicy Salmon Maki more. This maki consists of soft aburi salmon, slightly spicy mentaiko sauce with just-right creaminess, thinly battered and succulent prawn 😙. The fact that it was not jelak at all was the main reason why we reckoned it was a better maki. 😎
The mekajiki (swordfish) was so fresh, plump, succulent and juicy. We just had to order more for the great enjoyment. 😍
Barashi Tei is super generous with their thick cuts of sashimi. Fresh enough and worth every dollar we paid for. Though salmon was slightly dry, we were very impressed with the juicy swordfish. 😘
Chawanmushi is always a good compliment to anything Japanese. And the one at Barashi Tei was really smooth, tasty, and the wobbliness was on spot! 😋
Barashi Tei is currently having 15% promo for their set menu. Each set comes with miso soup, rice, pickles and watermelon. 
Freshly flown in from Japan, this smelt so much like the sea! 👍🏼👍🏼
The Spicy Salmon Maki ($12.80) was a clear winner with a fat juicy ebi tempura down the center wrapped with rice &amp; Aburi salmon &amp; topped with spicy mentaiko &amp; ikura! \n<br />Definitely a bundle of joy both for my palate &amp; in my belly! \n<br />Special thanks to @barashitei for having us &amp; @fatwithin for hosting us! 😊
 A hot favourite on the table, this Ishikari Nabe Teoshoku is made with Japanese mackerel. The fish is firm and meaty, yet easily crumbles when you put it in your mouth. I especially love that the Nabe is filled with so much veggies!!!
If there was a good contender for the best dish at Barashi Tei, it has to be this plate of spicy salmon maki roll. Creamy, crunchy and slightly spicy - it\'s a sure win on the table! 
Yet another fail proof dish was this Barashi salad with chunky fish cubes and leafy vegetables. Just pour in the Wafu sauce and it\'s good to go! 
Will fall asleep with a satisfied belly. 😋\n<br />Barashi-Tei ‣ 266 Middle Road, Elias Building, Singapore 188991\n<br />#BarashiTei
Ebi tempura wrapped with slightly spicy aburi salmon, was one of the dish that stood out that night. As you devour each maki, you might also want to try their Gindara Nabe ($24). Stock brewed for long hour so flavour is retain and perfect match for the buttery gindara slices. Good thing is that this place opens till 4am, so you can have sushi before heading next door for some Tau Huay!
The party that consists of the sushi rice, ebi fry, aburi salmon and topped with a spicy mayo before getting blow-torched was clearly having a time of their lives on the platter, basking in all the limelight and getting all the celebrity status, before being devoured clean by all the hungry tummies.
Fresh Authentic Japanese dishes like Avocado Salmon Salad, Bara Chirashi, Chirashi Don ($13.80-$26.00) in affordable prices. Highly recommend their Spicy Ebi Maki (not in photo).

That slab huge of Foie Gras was lightly torched &amp; glazed with a sweet savoury sauce. Foie Gras is eventually like Butter &amp; this eventually melts. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />So sinful yet so good.

I think I spent most of it just sleeping my head and body aches away between dance trainings. 😴 But I did also roll with it and eat #sushi! Tried this #unagi #avocado #maki ($12.80 I think) from a new late night #Japanese place @barashitei which was pretty deelishious though not a stunner. Meal for 2 came up to a bit more than expected though (&gt;$70), for a small simple place with not particularly large portions. 🐟 #burpple #food #foodpics #japfood #instafood #whatiate

But the udon here is cooked with an al dente consistency and stays springy even though it is soaked in the mildly flavoured broth\n<br />That in itself is already more impressive than the variety of tempura served alongside it

Soft in texture and piquant in flavour, you can come here and savor their chirashi don even at 4am in the morning and you know you will be getting quality at the end of it
This is so pretty and yummy.
Thumbs up to their affordable and value for money menu items and I strongly recommend this restaurant to those who fancy Japanese food

From my understanding, sanma is one of the most well-known seasonal fish representing autumn in Japanese cuisine. Perhaps it is the novelty of eating it, I enjoyed savouring it bit by bit.

Agreed that the cuts were thick, fresh yes not bad; but not those fatty cuts that satisfy the crave for good sashimi. Nevertheless, at $23 for a set, we would still consider it decent for the money. Try their grilled giant scallop with mentaiko it was good though rather pricey. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #chirashi

Barachirashi ($13.80+)\n<br />Plenty of sashimi to go around. Loved the raw scallops too. Sashimi wasn\'t crazy overly seasoned. Good balance of rice &amp; sashimi.
