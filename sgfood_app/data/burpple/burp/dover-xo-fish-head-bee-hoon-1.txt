Standard order every time I\'m here 😍
Nothing beats a plate of crispy prawn paste chicken that is the Asian version of KFC. But, only a hundred times better. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. KFC or even Popeyes I think you lose out miserably in terms of texture, and taste. || Price: S$8
They did not cut back on the XO, making the broth super fragrant and heavenly. I just can\'t stop slurping. The fish slices are not slices, they are big chunks which are far more yummier to bite on. || Price: S$12/2pax
It\'s been a crazy day at work - and I really mean it. Such a whirlwind of events, from backstabbing to people being let go (read:fired) but as long as I keep my head buried in work it\'ll be all 👌 can always count on this #dover road #xo #fishnoodles to hug you from the inside LOL
XO fish head noodles. Back to good old Singapore food!
Post-flea dinner! XO fish meat beehoon and Red City 7 mixed grill hotplate and chicken cutlet.
Usually not too crazy about fish soup. But this is real good. 
I name this the best har cheong kai. Juicy and just the right amount of shrimp paste. 
Our standard go-to meal for wet/rainy/cold days. Although its a bit of a trek, we always make the effort cos it\'s just so darn comforting. Like a big hug on the inside 😊
😍😍😍Hot, crispy, juicy and umami. The drumsticks are particularly meaty and plump, amazing to sink your teeth into. The light batter is perfectly crispy, and the sweet chili gives just the right amount of kick. 
The portion is definitely much more than normal ones you’ll get outside and it’s certainly value for money.\n<br />・\n<br />P.S. They’re famous for their XO Fish Head Bee Hoon too!\n<br />・\n<br />Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hoon\n<br />Blk 19A Dover Cres\n<br />#01-05\n<br />Singapore 131019\n<br />・\n<br />#burpple #FoodiegohBuonaVista\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />#instadailyphoto #photooftheday #followme #picoftheday #follow #instadaily #food #yummy #foodstagram #foodgasm #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #dailyinsta #foodsg #singaporefood #whati8today #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #8dayseat #singaporeinsiders #singaporeeats #sgfoodtrend #sgigfoodie #thisisinsiderfood #foodinsingapore #foodinsing

Broth wasn\'t too thick and love the huge chunks of fish! And the other dishes - pork ribs, tofu with mushrooms and shrimps, kailan vegetables - were all very tasty! 👍
Thanks to Lina now I know! #latergram #foodporn #eatoutsg #hawkergems #xobeehoon #dover #burpple #burpplesg #chiongedtherebcostheycloseat11 😂
Very nice soup base.
Very crispy and right texture BUT very salty! 😅
This is one of the better XO 鱼头米粉 in Singapore!

Lunch away from the office today because there\'s too much drama going on. XO fish noodle soup!
They should just call this taugay horfun! 😑😑😑
Must try! Yummy =)
Classic.
San Low Horfun at the usual place. :)
One of the best Har Jeong Gai (prawn paste chicken) I\'ve had the pleasure to taste. :) #burpple
XO fish noodles for lunch #burpple
Been awhile since we had this.
Yummy
