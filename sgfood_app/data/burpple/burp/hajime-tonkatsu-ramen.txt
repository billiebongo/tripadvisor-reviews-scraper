Chef Tan-San speciality, the crisp, golden, panko crumb battered pork loin is tender and moist.
Loved the creamy rich, nutty black sesame flavour and the fragrant crunch from the white sesame.
Richly flavoured pork bone broth that is uniquely savoury sweet and rather delicate.
It goes well with the tonkatsu sauce mixed with sesame seeds that makes one bowl of rice not enough to finish the cutlet, hence rice is free-flow alongside with the cabbage! The pickled vegetables were just right and the miso soup had a tinge of yuzu flavour on it!
Available also in a set with rice and soup, I ordered the ala-carte version instead which comes with only the meat alone. Each slice delivers a satisfying crispiness where the golden-brown fried batter shatters with every single bite, while the pork loin was tender with a good proportion of chewy fattiness and lean meat that was easy to chew. 
There seem to be better spots for Ramen  in town; definitely not very impressed with this one where the noodles weren\'t as springy as we would expect them to be while the broth itself seemed thick, but only to have tasted a little bland and mildly spicy from the chili oil. The Tonkatsu served here also seemed to be different from the ala-carte Tonkatsu — seemingly leaner but fried in a batter that is less crispier for it lacks a little crunch in comparison. Egg on the side is considered an add on for an extra $2.
Tonkatsu\'s one of the best I\'ve eaten so far. I find the curry sauce a little too overwhelming for my taste. The pork itself is pretty good; of a thick cut and not oily at all. Prices fairly reasonable. I think this was around $16. Overall, a pleasant experience dining at Hajime. 
Checking out this new kid on the block in my Neighbourhood and have to say it\'s pretty decent. Juicy tonkatsu, washed down with Yuzu flavoured miso soup... I only wished the portions were bigger. Word has it that they do a decent rendition of tonkatsu ramen too, and if the chefs previous ventures were anything to go by, this is certainly worth trying too. 
Hajime Tonkatsu &amp; Ramen takes over the now-defunct Relish at myVillage, serving tonkatsu sets as well as ramen. The man behind it is no other than chef Tan-San, the former founding chef of tonkatsu restaurant Tonkichi and ramen chain Tampopo, who brings with him over 25 years of experience. Order the Premium Pork Loin ($19.90) — pork fillet with a crispy, crunchy coating served with refreshing yuzu miso soup and free flow of rice and cabbage. Other options include the spicy Tonkatsu Ramen ($14.90) and the Salmon Don ($16.90). The latter comes with fried salmon slices and a wobbly onsen egg, and is topped with an addictively tasty umami sauce.\n<br />Avg price: $20 per person
.\n<br />Helmed by Chef Tan-San, the man who mastered the art of Tonkatsu and first to brought it to Singapore when he previously helmed Tonkixxx and Tampxxx many years back.\n<br />.\n<br />Even thought I didn\'t try the full Tonkatsu set, the pork fillet from ramen was crispy and tender without a hint of grease. Now that rekindled my love for Tonkatsu.
Recommend getting anything here with tonkatsu. It\'s really light and crispy. Ramen broth is above average, but still better than those served in the run-of-the-mill ramen chains. 
This was sooo tasty!! From the new tonkatsu place that took over Relish in Myvillage, this place doesn\'t charge GST yet so it\'s quite worth it! This salmon don was so on point, with fried salmon pieces and an onsen egg on top, drizzled with a very umami sauce and furikake topping. 
Comes with yuzu miso soup, free flow cabbage and rice. The pork was reasonably tender, and it was generally tasty and pretty good!! The yuzu soup was also interesting and I really enjoyed and subtle yuzu flavor. Wish it were free flow too! 
The risotto is perfectly timed, and absorbs the hearty lobster bisque, giving some great texture on top of the crunch of fresh, properly cooked lobster. Amazing, especially that bisque!
Hajime’s Katsu Don set $13.90.

So if you prefer pork fillet/tender to pork loin, you should get this one 👌🏼\n<br />💲: $18.50++\n<br />Rate: 4.3/5
Untainted by any sauces, makes it all the more delicious\n<br />🍚\n<br />Nigata rice is nice &amp; firm, and starchy enough to pick up bite sized lumps, using chopsticks (subject to individual\'s level of chosptick mastery)
🐓\n<br />Its crunchy crispy savory sweet, topped with sesame seeds &amp; ultra thin slices of nori, accompanied with some leafy lettuce\n<br />🍻\n<br />Goes well with liquid bread (aka beer) anyday, anywhere, anytime

The potato are freshly mashed daily with Japanese pork bits. They are nicely packed together and captured the umami factor. And of course to ladies, who are health conscious like myself. Notice the paper tissue on Potato Korokke, it’s totally dry. Who doesn’t want another piece of tasty Potato Korokke; less the oiliness. And to my surprise that it remains crispy even when cool.\n<br />.\n<br />Potato Korokke at S$3.90 nett.\n<br />.\n<br />Read on foodgem.sg/food/japanese/hajime-tonkatsu-ramen\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine?\n<br />Hajime Tonkatsu &amp; Ramen\n<br />1 Maju Avenue, myVillage @ Serangoon Garden, #02-07/8/9, 556679\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#HajimeTonkatsuRamen #japanesefood \n<br />#korokke #singapore #singapore2017 #sgfood #sgig #igsg #sgblogger #sgfoodblogger #sgcafe #singaporeinsiders #whati8today #burpple #instafood_sg #sginstagram #foodpornsg #exploresingapore #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #foodgemsg

Indeed a proud creation by Chef Tan-San - the first Tonkatsu chef in Singapore\n<br />🐷
Hajimemashite = Nice to meet you\n<br />🍜
You get spinach stuffed within the folds of the pork layers, with a splash of plum sauce in between too. It is a sweet and savoury dish, and a brave diversion from the usual layered Tonkatsu such as cod roe stuffings or cheese!\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />Thanks @hajime_tonkatsu_ramen for the unique dish 😋\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #igfoodies #whati8today #8dayseat #burpple #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgfoodblogger #hkfood #huffposttaste #sgmakandiary #TSLmakan #eatoutsg #foodbeast #foodaholic #foodpornshare #singaporeinsiders #foodpornasia #instafood_sg #singaporefood #mychefstable #foodnetwork #foodandwine

.\n<br />The 🐷 just melts in your mouth. The lighter part is more meaty and lean, but the darker part is just sublime. It has more fats and you can definitely experience PORKGASM!.\n<br />.\n<br />Set meal comes with free flow of Nigata Rice, fresh cabbage. Tonjiru soup also served with the set meal.

No, corn nor extra leeks nor floating bits and bobs of chili oil. Here, simplicity is key and you know so from the self-ordering service counter and fast turn-over rates
very affordable compared to other tonkatsu places. \n<br />will consider coming back to try the donburi. \n<br />#dinner #sunday #tonkatsu #pork #miso #japanese #sgfood #nomnom #foodporn #whatiate #cameraeatsfirst #makan #sgeats #yummy #sgfoodie #ishootieat #burpple #myvillage #instafood #foodgasm
then there\'s the fact that the pork loin is gorgeously crumbed(both top and bottom, which is a rarity) and the ramen broth is a legit tonkatsu broth sans the excessive saltiness nor fou fou
Ordered this for it seems like a more suitable side for the Ramen for most sides were deep-fried here. Again, these Gyoza felt pretty well-filled with meat but I wished the skin was a little thicker so it holds up better — these seemed to remind me of the Gyoza that I have had at Ramen &amp; Tonkatsu Ma Maison at Capitol Piazza a few days ago.
