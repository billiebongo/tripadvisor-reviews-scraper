Good choice for eating healthy.
Salmon, tuna, mesclun, avocado, cucumber, orange, red wine apple üçé, chives, yuzu zest üçã and yuzu sauce. I ordered mine without tuna and kinda liked the sauce. Great idea for a healthier option. üëçüèº
Seared salmon, crab meat ü¶Ä, avocado, cucumber, jicama and red roe. I had to Google what \'jicama\' is. It\'s a Mexican turnip/ yam bean.
Salmon salad which includes a tray of cabbages, cherry tomatoes, grapefruit and etc. It\'s little too sour for my liking even I didn\'t pour all the dressing in when I tossed it. Quite a serving which is good for 1-2. Costs $11.95
This sushi is quite a creative creation of Sushi! Really loved the combi of cream cheese, unagi &amp; avocado! Pretty pricey but, I\'ll definitely always go for more &amp; more!! ($14.80, if i\'m not wrong)
Innovative sushi roll. One of my favorite I must say. There\'s unagi, cream cheese and avocado. So you can imagine that the filling is quite smooth! The unagi is wrapped on top of the sushi with salmon roe. Cost: $14.95. 
Healthy salmon salad for lunch today. An interesting mix of ingredients: grapefruit, olives, capers and a pretty decent portion of salmon sashimi with ponzu dressing. Salads were $11.95 each and there were other items on the menu (sushi rolls, rice bowls) that looked really good too. Worth a try if you\'re looking for a healthier option!
.\n<br />My beloved sushi roll is now more accessible as Rollie Olie has recently also opened its 2nd outlet at Pasarbella @ Suntec.\n<br />.\n<br />Now I don\'t have to travel all the way to west just to satisfy my aburi salmon craving. üôå
Rollie Olie\'s $12.95 set meal, which they trumpet as their best deal, lets you choose between one of their 2 daily rolls on offer and comes with a standard issue garden salad which is backed up by a generous amount of oh-so-addictive Kewpie sesame dressing and is rounded off by their interesting yet familiar tasting miso onion soup. 
Fresh salads with lots of different ingredients. Packed with protein-rich seared tuna and soft-boiled eggs! Really interesting concept since they have different sauces at the counter so at some point my salad had 6 different dressings. Service was great but quite slow though. Waited about 15-20mins for my salad.
Overall a great package but I am still a bigger fan of @rollwithmakisan! A different concept, but I prefer the customization and options at Maki-san. The onion miso soup interesting but not a must have.
From the first bite - \"It\'s like a party in my month, and everyone\'s invited!\" I might be a little biased as this sushi roll consist of all my favourite ingredients but the creaminess of the avocado, flavoured (wasabi) mayonnaise and the lightly torched salmon was simply delish. You could taste each and every ingredient, the shredded crab meat, crunchy cucumber, the red roe and jicama (mexican yam). It is a little on the pricey side at $16.95 (8 pieces) but I will definitely be back to try the other signature rolls!!!
$14 shared between two, too much kanikama in my opinion but tasted good!
8 pcs || Seared salmon, crab meat, avocado, cucumber, jcama, red roe || $16.95.                                                              A place on my radar the moment I heard about it. A little pricey in my opinion but def worth the try. Will probably be back to try out their other combinations ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèº
Savoury salmon, with a burst of sweet roe and creamy sauce - it\'s easy to understand the Sunkissed Salmon\'s appeal within the first bite. This maki is deceptively innocuous, but a set (2 rows) can be quite filling. Get this crowd-pleaser at least once if you\'re at Rollie Olie.
Thanks to the curry prawn hidden within and the generous helping of mustard, this maki boasts a subtly spicy and fragrant taste. Worth a try!
This is the K Pop roll (spicy crab meat, kimchi, avocado, cucumber, jicama and chives). I didn\'t really like this one because of the overpowering kimchi flavour. Will go back to try the other more popular flavours! Pricey though imo.
Had the set meal (soup + salad + half roll) at $12.90! Choices of rolls are different each day. This is the set with the Go Green roll (asparagus, sweet potato, lettuce, avocade, cucumber, jicama and alfafa). Definitely a healthy option and was refreshing. For days when you want to go green! Ps. Try out the different sauces they have at the counter! 
Back at Rollie Ollie for dinner and this time I tried the sunkissed salmon. Think crabmeat, avocado and cucumber sushi roll with aburi salmon, a dollop of mentaiko and spiced roe. It\'s not only yummy but also pretty to look at! For an additional $1, you can throw in green tea or soup! 
This place offers a good ambiance, and coupled with sushi, it makes a good option for anyone who\'s looking for a meal of sushi. A box of sushi can be shared even between 2, as their portions are pretty big. 
new kid at the star! pretty yummy and about the same price as makisan :-)
Plenty of hand roll choices, nice place to sit down and have a meal, friendly staff too.
Rollie Olie is a new eatery specialising in, yes you guessed it right, maki rolls!! Very Instagram worthy and delicious maki rolls that are freshly made to order.
So happy to have found a new lunch place at Buona Vista area! Tried their Dos Amigos (grilled eel, cream cheese, and avocado) and Caterpillar (crab meat, cucumber, avocado) from their Signature Rolls and Crispy Shrimp (Skinny Roll) and they were all good! Especially love the Skinny Roll options for those who are watching their weight and would like less carbs! Would definitely be back to try other items in their menu. 
Gorgeously-presented makis that taste as fantastic as they look. The sun-kissed salmon had a lovely smokey flavour (you can watch them flame grill it right before serving it to you) and while the caterpillar looked unassuming, the flavour was amazing. Loved how they were generously packed with ingredients and sauce, and each maki is lovingly made-to-order. How\'s that for freshness? I can\'t wait to order everything else on the menu üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Cross-section of my sunkissed salmon: crab meat, avocado, cucumber, lightly torched to create this delish seared salmon, topped with roe. A little on the pricey side ($16.95, 8 pieces of this) but yum!
Rollie Olie offers gorgeous sushi rolls that are freshly made upon order. You get to choose from an interesting variety of novel Asian fusion types such as Bollywood with curry prawn filling, or the K Pop kimchi-flavoured sushi roll. Prices range from $12.95 to $16.95 per roll. For familiar flavours, go for the Sunkissed Salmon ($16.95), or the Dos Amigos ($14.95) which marries grilled eel and cream cheese, and is topped off with red roe!
Though not the most novel of creations, the Sunkissed Salmon ($16.90) was no less tasty than the others. Punchy mentaiko always works like magic with salmon aburi, and this was no exception.
Rollie-ing into the fray of F&amp;B tenants is this new sushi joint that rolls creativity, presentation, and taste into one. Sushi fiends will be spoilt for choice with its sheer variety of creative rolls (vegetarian option available too), small bites, and even sushirritos (like a Jap-inspired burrito).
The O List
The paper boxes makes it difficult for photo taking... But definitely do not fall short in taste. Trying out this 2 week old eatery at The Star Vista. Spicy tuna with avocado, cucumber, jicama and peppergrass. The tuna is super fresh and literally melts in your mouth. Really like how the jicama adds a slightly sweet and crunchy flavour to the sushi roll. The peppergrass is very fun to eat as well. 
From a new sushi roll stall named Rollie Olie at The Star Vista. Dos Amigos is a maki roll with grilled eel, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, jicama and red roe. This was really a party in the mouth; the savoury grilled eel, the smooth and luscious cream cheese, crunchy juiciness from the cucumber, crispness of tempura crunch and the popping sensation and umami flavours of the red roe. A great idea for a quick takeaway lunch for the health conscious!
From a new sushi roll stall named Rollie Olie at The Star Vista. Coming with a side salad, the sticks came with thick cuts of raw tuna and salmon slices with a grape stuck in between. Love how the grape exploded with sweetness to flavour up the slices of fish. Accompanying dip was described as Wasabi mayo, but tasted more like Honey Mustard with a tinge of lemon. Hmm ....
Tried the K-pop ($12.95) and Dos Amigos ($14.95). Personally I preferred Dos Amigos with unagi on top and cream cheese inside! The K-pop one tasted too much like a Korean bimbap rather than a Japanese sushi roll üòõ
This is their Yuzu Bliss poke bowl, which consists of fresh and thick dices of salmon and tuna, with romaine, yuzu, avocado and cucumber ü§§ Soon... soon..\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤: $17.95++\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #makansg #sgfoodies #instafood #instafoodies #foodstagram #foodgasm #sgfoodgrammers #indofoodgrammers #foodgrammers #indofoodies #eatgasm #burpplesg #burpple #pokebowl #rollieolie #starvista #buonavista #eatclean #salad #healthybowl #sgrestaurant #eatoutsg #sgculinary

üåà\n<br />Check out the beautiful colors of Rollie Ollie\'s Aloha Poke with the Haiwaiian vibes!\n<br />üòé\n<br />Full of textures, the poke bowl consists of creamy avocado, paired with crunchy vegetables with a subtle sweetness from the tamago and of course chunky savoury and piquant pieces of tuna and salmon, marinated with wasabi sauce. The aromatic tea infused rice lends extra fragrance, balancing the intense flavours from the wasabi sauce, giving a well rounded and healthy poke bowl.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#rollieollie #sgfoodies #igsg #sgig #discoversg #burpple #whati8today #stfoodtrending #pokebowl #hungrygowhere #sgfoodporn #foodvsco #onthetable #weekendvibes #pasarbella #sgeats #instafood_sg #instafoodsgram #whati8

Really enjoyed the huge chunks of tuna and salmon slices but the other stuff needs much more dressings 3.7/5
Sunkissed salmonüëçüèª &amp; cali dream
Generous portion of ingredients.
The zesty sauce add tang and flavour to the mix and this dish will be an absolute delight for those who are health conscious or sashimi lovers
An interesting concept, a tad pricey but definitely worth it!! 
Fast on the go sushi rolls with a modern twistüòã
For Rollie Ollie, Rolls &gt; Salads ($11.95)  for sure!! so don\'t waste your time on the salads like us heh üòÖ
Aloha Pok√© bowl.
Was craving for both Unagi and spicy stuff but the rolls were quite underwhelming as the Êñô didn\'t gel together with the rice. Very colorful indeed....but ah I think I\'ll go grab some sushi from the supermarket next time heh.
I will say this: These aren\'t going to be the most photogenic sushi rolls. Because after 2 MRT rides &amp; lots of walking, you should be thankful that your sushi is even intact when you get home!
Ordered the Dos Amigos with grilled eel, cream cheese and avocado - it was OMG üòç guess it\'s time for some avo-cardio üòÖüòÜ

Innovative sushi roll. This is with lots of shellfish. Not for people who are allergy to them. You can find soft shell crabs and prawn salad in it. Besides it, there\'s this baked cheese cracker and strawberry bits on it which gives the sushi roll a different texture and taste. Something worth trying. Cost: $16.95 and you can get a non-sugar green tea with extra $1.
A yummilicious sushi roll with eel, egg, avocado, roe, seaweed &amp; crispy tempura bits. A bit of a long wait but worth it. So nicely done!! Thoroughly had a great time eating thisüòÑ #sushiroll #sushilovers #eel #lunch #i8mondays #8dayseat #burpple #burpplesg #hungrygowhere #openricesg #singaporeeats #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggerssg #chopesg #instafollowers
Slowly breaking apart the whole salmon aburi and savoring it is just indescribable beyond words.
The medley of sweet, zesty and savory flavours all blend in gently together to awaken your tastebuds
YUM
Sunkissed Salmon (aburi salmon, crab meat, avocado, jicama, mentaiko &amp; spiced roe) and a salad set with onion miso soup &amp; Bollywood (curry prawn tempura, avocado) üç£üëç Love the range of dips available (esp Yuzu Mustard &amp; Curry Mayo!) and great service :)
Healthy but tasty! Best of both worlds. üòù
Give me this anytime and it will feel like morning anytime of the day! Lol \n<br />The rice aren\'t too tightly compressed until neediing efforts to chew on, salmon arent too overly torched until it is dry &amp; just enough mayo to give that hint of sweetness! Love it! \n<br />#sushirolls #japanesefood¬†#foodie¬†#foodporn¬†#foodstagram#sushi¬†#sgfood¬†#sgfoodies¬†#singapore¬†#instafood_sg¬†#burpple¬†#rollieolie #eatoutsg

Spicy tuna, avocado.....
For fast-ish food, this presentation is phenomenal.
üç£ affordable, good portions of food served, good service &amp; a very comfortable environment ‚Äî food was about $16 for each box of 8 pieces (3 people couldn\'t finish all the food so, i think it\'s very worth it) 
A new sushi roll shop at my church building, that we can have some healthy fun food after services.
