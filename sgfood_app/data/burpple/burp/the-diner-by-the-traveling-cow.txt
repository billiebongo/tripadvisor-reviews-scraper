And a helluva alcohol collection here... I\'m in awe of The Diner\'s bar!!! Such a dream to be here. The Traveling COW was also at Singapore Night Festival over the weekend. #sgfood #igsg #sgfoodies #instagramsg #foodphotography #instafood #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodblog #openricesg #8dayseatout #burpple #yummypin #sgfood #sgfoodies #thefoodstand

The taste so great till I\'m still missing it! 😋😋
The laksa taste is real strong. Quite a good one. 😊
Interesting dish which I am glad to share with a few fellow foodies.
