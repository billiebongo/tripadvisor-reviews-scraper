Sunday brunches SHOULD be \'too much\' and leave you feeling a little guilty afterwards. Les Patisseries\' Truffle Pasta is exactly that - a little over the top and irresistibly cheesy. The sauce has two types of chunky mushrooms, porcini and button. Just when you thought Truffle was so 2016, Les Patisseries will make you think again!
I simply fell in love with this Signature Porky Burger (S$19.00). Between those charcoal buns sits a pork patty, melted cheese, caramelised onions, lettuce, tomato and an egg (look at that wobbly yolk!). Even if you try to press the buns together and watch that yolk ooze, these breads will not give way and will help to absorb the excess juices.
One of my fav waffle list now. They open till 2am! I went at 1.15am and got a 10% off, not sure what promotion is that. So it is S$14.30 instead\n<br />üëçüèª 4/5\n<br />‚úîÔ∏è Definitely coming here when i visit Thomson area. I don\'t mind trying their brunch too\n<br />üìç Nearest MRT: Marymount MRT
Mac &amp; Cheese, $17.\n<br />Salmon Pasta, $16.
While many have already sung praises over the desserts and waffles here, I was more impressed with their hearty yet scrumptious Chicken Parmigiana (S$16.00) that I had for dinner just now. 
.\n<br />Houjicha Pancake ‚Äî$17\n<br />Roasted greentea batter with matcha spread. Was expecting some filling to flow from within but no surprise. Best eaten with the sweet matcha spread and fruits altogether.\n<br />.\n<br />#lespatisseries #pancake #throwback #desserts #matcha
The three cheeses played it as subtle and coy as an oft-love lettered Methodist Girls\' School student, while elsewhere the sriracha bacon was more assertive, bringing its tingling, stickily chewy pork game to the yard. 3.6/5\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Les Patisseries.
Rose Waffle, Rose and Lychee Sorbet, Raspberry Sorbet, Lychee Pur√©e, Lychee, Fresh Raspberry, Rose Petal and Macaron. The waffle itself is rather decent; a light hint of rose and quite crisp with a plush interior. Rose and lychee sorbet was a tad too sweet, though I liked the tartness of the raspberry sorbet which was quite balanced. Overall it comes together tasting almost like Bandung with notes of lychee detected ‚Äî a flavour that should reside well with ladies looking for a dessert that isn\'t too sweet.
If you have space for only one pastry or bake here, I would probably say just get this one. Coming in a chocolate tart base; it might seem a little tough to cut through but it breaks off neatly and still maintains its crispness when it\'s in the mouth. What leaves you wanting for more is that smooth hazelnut ganache that\'s just so nutty and a little chocolatey ‚Äî definitely works if you are craving for something rich for the after-brunch dessert.
Part of Les Patisseries\' dinner menu, this was one of the better items available. The ribs itself was quite succulent and tender, smothered in a thick, flavourful BBQ sauce. Wedges on the side were well-fried for they were crisp and the coleslaw adds a refreshing, crunchy touch.
Sliced Angus Beef served with couscous, saut√©ed mushrooms, Asian-style coleslaw, organic zucchini, butternut squash, grilled baby corn and asparagus. From the dinner menu at Les Patisseries; perhaps their attempt in doing a grain bowl though the result felt a tad messy ‚Äî perhaps too many things served on the same plate. The beef itself was decently done though much of the other stuff here seemed to carry a hint of truffle in it; not quite what I was expecting from a grain bowl. It was actually decent but overall perhaps it wasn\'t really up my alley for how busy the entire plate seemed to be.
Not a fan of \"charcoal\" anything but I do have to admit that the burger buns are actually quite decent here; it\'s reasonably light and fluffy with a good crustiness to it after being grilled before serving. Overall felt the pork patty was a tad too porky, and it\'s amplified with the addition of bacon over the top though I appreciate how they have added the caramalised onions for a little sweetness to add in a little more dimension to the flavour profile of the burger. Wedges are well-fried; crisp and all.
The batter itself was a tad thick, but I liked how seasoned this is for the salted flavour though some might find this dish lacking on the crab\'s natural sweetness. I like how it went with that Thai chili sauce on the side for a little tinge of sweet spiciness as well as the caviar around for a umami flavour, though the guacamole seemed like a loose link to the entire dish overall.
This would probably fit well with those who doesn\'t like things too cheesy ‚Äî despite three cheeses being used for the Mac &amp; Cheese, the result was more of a light touch than full-on stringy cheesiness. The main star of the show here seems to be the Sriracha Bacon ‚Äî glistening bacon that looks like Bak Kwa that is simply tempting just with it looks; it\'s crisp and chewy while coated in a sweet and mildly spicy (it barely tingles but it\'s so good!) glaze that makes the entire dish interesting just by its own.
The Houjicha Pancake was in fact more like a light chocolate cake with just a very weak tinge of Houjicha aroma at the end ‚Äî not quite how it sounded like on the menu as the tea fragrance was barely detectable. The matcha sauce did try to fix things a little, but the berries and vanilla ice-cream (which was good on its own btw) didn\'t help for they just overwhelmed the already weak Houjicha flavours even further.
One of their signatures from the days when they were in Toa Payoh; linguine, homemade truffle paste, mushroom, truffle oil, cream and mozzarella cheese. A comforting baked pasta dish with a good amount of stringy, melted cheese that covers the entire pan with pasta beneath, this would fit well with truffle fans for it carries the flavour evidently throughout, with bits of mushrooms everywhere for an earthy, bouncy bite.
From their brunch menu ‚Äî brioche, lobster chunks in lime mayonnaise, free-range poached eggs, Mentaiko Hollandaise, mixed greens. Overall not too bad an option although pricey at $22 if anyone sees it as just-another-Benedict dish (but there\'s lobsters here). Poached eggs are runny, the Hollandaise has just a very light tinge of Mentaiko to it and it comes all atop of the crusty, toasted brioche with a hint of sweetness to it. Lobster chunks were actually sweet though most of the flavours was masked with the lime mayonnaise which gives it a  zingy flavour though I could probably do without it.
The pancake starts off like a comfortably light, brownie-esque chocolate cake before quietly unveiling a dusky, gracefully understated hojicha fragrance and bitterness which lingers on your tongue long after the moment has passed (like the mouthly ghost of a breathless French kiss which ended too soon), while elsewhere the almost unnecessary and milkily sweet matcha spread provided more explicit sweet saucy accompaniment for those who prefer tea nudity over modesty. 4.1/5 ‚†Ä‚†Ä\n<br />P.S. Since the recent trend of tea-infused pancakes began, I\'ve done a brief round and can conclude that this is the only one for which I foresee return visits. Or it could be the others I managed to try just happened to be parlously atrocious.
Small and expensive (ranging from $7 to $10), we didn\'t try any. We tried the ice cream though (without waffle) and I was not impressed. I think their cakes should fare better, seeing how this is first and foremost a patisserie, not ice cream parlor.
When I had this at the former Toa Payoh location I had this observation: \"The waffle felt a bit flaccid but the warmness and fragrance of the rose flavour enlivened the proceedings. The multiple elements ‚Äì rose, raspberry and lychee ‚Äì shared the throne amicably, with no diva catfighting in sight.\"\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />Fast forward to the same item at their current Upper Thomson space. The rose-fragrant waffle now stands more confidently erect, possessing a slight crisp with edges that will engage your teeth. Elsewhere, the raspberry sorbet was sweetly refreshing, and the lychee sorbet will evoke fond memories of cookhouse lychee cordial for NSMen everywhere. 3.8/5
The Horlicks ice cream was quite good really, one of the better ones I\'ve had. The waffle on the other hand, though tasty, was waaaaay too crisp, and didn\'t have much flavour. I like the little random pieces of fruit: it\'s really contradicting in the whole plate, but when it gets a tad too sweet, the occasional sour berry really helps to cleanse the palate. All in all, a good spot for some late-night sugar.
$15.90 for one of the best ice cream waffles I\'ve had so far! Psst. You can replaced a scoop of the Thai milk tea with Horlicks ice cream! Best of both world. Crispy waffle with the perfect fluffy moist consistency on the inside. (I\'m not a fan of those dry and crispy ice cream waffles commonly found outside) a little pricey but this definitely isn\'t gonna be my last visit.
The waffles was not bad but the icecream was good! The most simple vanilla icecream exceeded my expectation. Cosy interior &amp; cute guys there too!!  Will def visit again! Price was $28.40 for both!üëçüèª
The rose lychee sorbet was refreshing, exactly what I needed in the blistering afternoon. I do wish the rose flavour was stronger in the waffles. But I will definitely be coming back because just where do you find a place that serves rose waffles with rose lychee sorbet in SG?! You can customise your waffles too, they have other interesting flavours like Earl Grey.  
Lychee and rose sorbet, raspberry sorbet. I can\'t stop eating those sorbet, it\'s addictive. Waffle is not as crispy as I expect but it\'s good enough. Macaron was not very sweet, just the right taste for me. \n<br />Definitely a instagram worth dish. Look how pretty it looks with those edible rose petal and lychee meat. üòç
Earl Grey Waffle ‚Äì Double scoop of Thai Milk Tea, Condensed Milk with Chocolate Macaron [$15.90] ‚Äì Larege Belgian like waffles, one of the few cafes in Singapore serving this chewy texture of waffles. Would personally request for more condensed milk.
It\'s not about loving just their good. Love is about loving their flaws, loving their shortcoming, loving their bad as much as you love their good. Love is not just loving them but also loving their family and their friends. Love is about loving them even no matter how big your fights are. Love is about seeing them smile, seeing them happy. Love is about making sacrifice and compromising. \n<br />Love is so much more.....\n<br />Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.¬†It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. \n<br />1 Corinthians 13:4-7
Knowing all the mixed reviews, I couldn‚Äôt help but try Les Patisseries‚Äô Waffle Ispahan with its delicate and lovely color palette. The rose-flavoured waffle was definitely different with the floral notes in the batter and a denser texture but slightly crisp exterior. Embellished with some edible rose petals, lychee chunks, raspberries and a sweet macaron, the scoops of lychee rose and raspberry sorbet was the highlight. Refreshing and light, the raspberry sorbet brought a nice tartness while the lychee rose sorbet delivered an aromatic punch.
Although texture-wise this waffle and ice cream need improvements, I pretty much love the lychee and raspberry sorbet. It\'s very refreshing and light on palate, a perfect way to complete your meal. Or maybe a tea time refreshment, since the weather is unbearably hot these weeks.
Loved the lychee sorbet as it tasted of real lychee! The waffle itself stayed crispy and the rose aroma from the waffle paired well with both sorbets! \n<br />@lespatisseries never lets me down when it comes to waffles!! They\'re always on point ! üòç
Thai milk tea ice cream with earl grey waffles $15.90 \n<br />The texture of the waffles has changed since my last visit when @lespatisseries was still at Toa Payoh. Loved the ice cream which had a lingering Thai milk tea flavour and aroma. The macaron wasn\'t too sweet either and was decent enough for me. Loved that the waffle came with fruits and crispy almond flakes! It\'s so pretty and tastes good too! üôå model : @rogerni
Whilst the slightly sour waffle had a gentle crisp and the nuts certainly were welcome guests, the late-blooming vanilla ice cream only revealed its tuition teacher-encouraged potential late in the game with some help from the Horlicks sauce and powder, and the sour berries looked like they would boost outreach and awareness but ultimately made as much sense and justified their invites as much as a snail along Lorong Mambong. 3.4/5
The thick, tall toasts are bread trees, and the other tropical elements a refreshing sweet waterfall that cascades relentlessly. 3.6/5
Other than toasts, they also offer a brunch menu as well as their signature waffles and cakes.
The waffles are to die for. Crispy moist and flavourful. Each bite is like drinking the tea itself. Topped with the chosen salted caramel, this is a wonderful pair. 
The earl grey waffle confidently lived up to its titular promise, but it quickly ceded attention to the Thai Milk Tea ice cream, which had more flag-waving rahrahness than VJC students during inter-school water polo matches. Elsewhere, the macaron stared at the skies quizzically like a lost stray kitten. 3.7/5
If this tea affair isn\'t your cup of, there are alternative waffle options such as Banoffee, Ispahan and Horlicks to choose from.
The Thai milk tea ice cream was so delicious and creamy! Added $2 for chocolate chip waffles which were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Superb waffle combination! 
My first try at this Bandung flavoured waffle. The ice cream was more like a Bandung sorbet and the lychee pieces looked like rose petals, a nice deportation touch. The waffles were fluffy, not to my liking but for $12.90. I felt it was pretty awesome! 
Crispy on the outside, not very fluffy but pretty chewy. Something different from the usual waffles I get but worth a shot. Yums! I love exploring my neighbourhood for cafes and desserts BUT sadly, many items on their menu are out of stock. :( #waffles #lespatisseriescafe #burpple #singaporeinsiders
3rd having this waffle and I am addicted to the Horlicks ice cream! The almond flakes were all crisp and fresh! The waffles are crispy and I love how the waffle never turns soggy! 
A chocolate mousse cake with a layer of orange in between and chocolate sponge cake at the bottom. Mousse was smooth, creamy and rich without pockets of air in between, and came with a slight zest from orange and orange bits within to bite. Chocolate Sponge cake was of the right density and has light flavours of cocoa sweetness. Works well with a cup of Earl grey tea for a tea time break.
There is no place that does better croissants than Les Patisseries. The flakiness of the croissant, coupled with that addictive buttery flavour (and this one comes with a scoop of ice cream!) makes it too irresistible. 
You can customise your own waffles here! However, I was too lazy so I went with the standard Thai milk tea waffle. The Thai milk tea ice cream is so good - creamy with the distinct fragrance of the tea. Quite like Creamier\'s imo. The waffle is crisp outside and a bit dense inside. Taste wise pretty average. Couldn\'t really taste the Thai milk tea sauce but I enjoyed it thoroughly as a whole. 
Croissant Bread Pudding ($6.50).\n<br />Replacing the usual bread with croissant, filled with melted chocolate and dried cherries, it is actually soft and moist inside, although a bit on the sweet side.
Waffles with a texture more on the softer and chewy side, making it filling. Vanilla ice cream was very thick in flavour. Macaron was more firm than the usual, with a strong taste of buttercream. Horlicks sauce was drizzled, not overwhelming, complimented as a nice dressing¬†
:) this is really yummy but every time I go they will tell me pasta only available for dinner. Lol

Mediocre at best &amp; can be easily replicated at home. The scrambled eggs were a lil\' overcooked, not the fluffy and creamy type that I like.
Am a sucker for anything Ispahan. Read some not so good reviews about the Ispahan Waffle but that doesn\'t stop me ordering &amp; try it myself.
Warm focaccia with fresh tomatoes, mixed greens &amp; smoked salmon. My tummy is one satisfied customer! üòã
The rose flavoured waffle is a bit soggy, but still fragrant and not too overpowering. Pair it with the tart raspberry sorbet, not cloyingly sweet lychee sauce and oooh... Worth a try if you don\'t mind spending $12.90 on something different! 
Having seen pictures of this Pierre Herme-inspired creation on various social media channels before visiting the cafe, I was expecting something truly pink and glorious.
This slightly monotonous dish wasn\'t quite as shiok as I expected it to be, although the copious amount of truffle oil used was commendable.
Very simply done pasta dishes that were just decent at best. But at this pricing (less than $14 nett each), I guess I can\'t complain.
And their pastries are just too tempting üòç\n<br />They had this on their wall:\n<br />\"A party without cakes is only a meeting \"\n<br />Couldn\'t agree more üòÅ -Dulcey Hazelnut Tart ‚Ä¢chocolate tart with caramel fillings topped w hazelnuts -Belgium Chocolate Waffle ‚Ä¢waffle w chocolate ice cream, berries and macaroon -Hot Chocolate -Green Tea Latte
The waffle felt a bit flaccid (not possessing the turgidity of the Horffles) but the warmness and fragrance of the rose flavour enlivened the proceedings. The multiple elements - rose, raspberry and lychee - shared the throne amicably, with no diva catfighting in sight. Yet another memorable waffle from Les Patisseries, and a very pleasant and successful homage to the Pierre Herm√© creation. 4/5
Best waffles ever! Even when the waffle was drenched in the melting ice cream, the waffle was still crispy! The ice cream tastes like natural horlicks! And because they took a while to prepare the waffles and I had to ask what was taking so long, one owner gave me an extra scoop of ice cream. The chocolate ice cream was rich and creamy and smooth! Best chocolate ice cream ever! For $9.90, it\'s worth every cent! And it has tons of almonds on it too :) 
The heavens are usually fair in their distribution of looks and taste - you are seldom allowed to be beautiful and delicious at the same time - but they must have been smitten by this minxy apple as it tastes slightly better than it should given its obvious attractiveness (just look at the friggin\' stalk and its Lana Del Rey droop of resignation). 3.75/5
at $11.90, it is a really filling meal. instead of using bread, they toasted half a croissant.
Smoked salmon was good! Tasted fresh and not too fishy nor salty. Scrambled eggs were decent! Toast was a letdown, it was very airy but tasted like stale white bread you buy from local bakeries. $11.90
Not the best around, could hardly taste the aroma of the truffle, and the Parmesan cheese shavings had hardly any taste. Won\'t recommend this, priced at $8.50.
Pretty stoked when this was served - waffle, ice cream, macaron and fruits all on the same plate! Despite the overwhelming choices, neither of them stood out. 
Truffle makes (almost) everything better - who would deny it! Would be great if more mushrooms were served. Worth a try still! 
The softness of the curd and the texture of the crust reminds me of egg tart! Refreshingly light, and more sweet than tart (that\'s enough tarts - Ed). 4/5
Was worried about it being Horlicks overkill, but Horlick cow, it proved to be one of the more memorable waffles around. Definitely a waffle not to be Horff-ed at or Horffled with (that\'s it - Ed). 4/5
I will said around 6/10. My first time Waffles are crispy and airy inside. Having doubts Co\'s I will still prefer waffles  crispy and soft on the inside which have more texture.   Berries sauce not bad. Overall I will only go back restaurant  if I\'m at that area. Not like today I went to hunt it down for the food.
Not bad. Overall I will only go back restaurant  if I\'m at that area. Not like today I went to hunt it down for the food.
Truffle taste too over powering that got me sick of the dish after 5 mouths. Mushrooms cut too small. Make the texture boring. The overpowering truffle taste plus boring texture make this dish bad.  Overall for this dish:  5.5/10.  Overall I will only go back restaurant  if I\'m at that area. Not like today I went to hunt it down for the food.
The crust may be a little too thick and hard, but I like it this way! üòçüòç Cutting down on the good food I\'m gonna have from today onwards, and getting back on meal prep! Besides all that good food have left me lots of back logging to do for my reviews! üôä I need all the discipline in the world today at Holland V!
Truffle infused baked mushroom pasta ($8.90)! It was tasty, but the top was slightly charred, resulting in the burnt taste! Wish they would add more mushrooms to it though, cause the mushrooms were YUM! üòã
A really photogenic dish, but we felt that the waffles were too hollow, and for me, overly crispy. Besides, the star of the show, Horlicks, was barely present!
somewhat yeasty, very crispy and crunchy. married with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and holicks sauce. @jielonglim gave it 4hands while I\'m still quite undecided. tried this yet? a new 2 month old cafe in toa payoh central.
This is really one goood dish i must recommend! Looks ordinary but taste extraordinary! It‚Äôs as though every penne has been infused with the truffle oil. Rich cheesy truffle taste with mushrooms aroma. Better than the all day breakfast set!
Decided to try out this new cafe. But I must say I was a little disappointed. The tart has a strange after taste. But my taste buds could be affected because I am falling sick. Shall give it another chance next time.
Their horffles [horlicks + waffles] is really unique and tasted pretty good as well!üòãüëç
My favorite among these three shall be the mango mousse cake, the sweetness of the cake was just nice. Another one that i would recommend its their macarons! 
Decent pastries and cakes in a neighbourhood. 
Bringing a variety of French pastries to Toa Payoh Central is Les Patisseries. This new kid on the block is opened by three graduates from local culinary schools. Les Patisseries literally means \'pastries\' in French, and that is exactly what should bring you through their doors. From macarons, tarts, cakes and croissants, you will definitely be spoilt for choice. Opt for their Dulcey Hazelnut Tart, L‚ÄôRocky, or stick to the basics and have a croissant with a cup of coffee from Pacamara Boutique Coffee Roasters.
Fore ground: Fraiser, with milky fragrance and not overly sweet, soothing and not gelat; mangue, strong mango taste, with a soft core but also not overly sweet. Pretty satisfied dessert to end the night on a sweet note.
üçíüçÖForest BerryüçìüçáCrunchy, lightly salted Sable Base topped with berries and piped with Creme patisserie.
Waffles here are really crisp and airy. I don\'t usually like my waffles to be so crisp, but the fragrance of the batter really won me over. Note: this isn\'t the fluffy doughy waffles you\'ll expect! The crunch goes really well with the earthy, not overly sweet caramel sauce and light vanilla ice cream. The macaron though pretty, was too chewy for my liking. Definitely $9.90 well spent!
Balance of sweetness and nuttiness was perfect! Nuts tasted fresh. The tart itself is good, not too crumbly but doesn\'t bring much to the dessert. 
The L\'Rocky was rather a good sweet dessert. Not too overpowering. More reviews on missingcupoflatte.blogspot.sg
But the Vanilla Macaron doesn\'t look..... vanilla-ish?
This is one quiche I thought I really enjoyed. Nice ratio of cheesiness with the egg and salmon within that made it a real savoury item with its different dimensions of flavour.
Heard that they use Pacamara blends here for their coffee. The Flat White here seemed to be on the milky side, though it does have a light body that has a slight fruity punch.
You know how Apple Tarts are always a bit too sweet? This one feels different though; the apple slices have a consistency that\'s not too hard, but still crunchy for a bite which gives a bit of a zingy touch. The real sweet part comes under it, a layer above the crust which gave it the kick. Crust was firm but easy to cut. A tart that not only looks pretty, but tasted pretty premium too!
Have your waffles, ice cream and macaron cravings satisfied here. But their waffles are a bit too hard for Ming\'s liking. Prefers fluffier waffles. Macaron is a bit hard too, probably it was frozen?
Les Patisseries also offer a wide selection of cakes. Shown here are the Fraisier ($5.50) and the Tiramisu ($7). The Fraisier is a French strawberry shortcake with a layer of sliced strawberry with immensely rich cream and topped with a strawberry. The Tiramisu had a strong coffee taste amidst the rich mascarpone cheese.
Also known as a chocolate croissant, the Pain au Chocolat ($3.20) here is not only flaky, but slightly crispy as well! The rich chocolate taste is also evenly spread across the pastry.
Les Patisseries sources its coffee beans from Pacamara Coffee Roasters, that provides this Flat White ($5) with a strong and firm coffee taste that has a balanced acidity.

Distinctively so with Horlicks ice cream and more Horlicks powder, its taste was complemented by crunchy almonds, fruits and condensed milk. Opt to swap the other vanilla ice cream with other flavours such as salted caramel or Thai milk tea. Only shortfall was that the waffle seemed to be flatter than before, hopefully just a glitch in their production today. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #waffles

The sauce was so aromatic and creamy that it made me want to lick it off the plate literally! üòç this is more than enough proof that Les Patisseries not only have good waffles, but their pasta is also worth a shot! #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #thegrowingbelly #pestocream #pestosalmon #linguine #pestocreamsalmonpasta #smoked #smokedsalmon #burpple

Discounts aside though, look at their signature Chicken with Waffles - a crispy exterior composed of prawn paste batter that covers a juicy and tender chicken interior, together with a crispy and fulfilling Waffle, along with coleslaw and their homemade sauce... one of the better chicken and waffles I\'ve had! #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #thegrowingbelly #chickenandwaffles #sin #sinlee #sinleefoods #burpple
Presenting Waffle Ispandan.\n<br />I personally love anything that has got to do with Rose and so I think it\'s good üòã

Bigger and better ambience, it is now a more cosy place to chill out at. Think their food have improved too.\n<br />This was the Thai milk tea &amp; Earl Grey waffle, which delivered in both taste and texture. In fact, I think they had hit it on the right spot with their range of specialty waffles, such as Horffles (Horlicks), Ispahan (rose waffle) and Earl Grey waffle. Anyone will be pleased with these waffles that are well decorated with roasted almond, fruits, topping sauces, macaron and even fresh flowers. \n<br />Will keep an open mind about their savory food, cakes and coffee when I try them again next time, but I know I will definitely be back for their waffles. #burpple #BurppleSG #sgmakandiary #waffles #dessertsg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies
Double scoop of rich chocolate ice cream with loads of chocolate sauce, fresh berries and almond flakes. Among the various waffles I have tried over here, I am still in love with their double chocolate waffle. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #waffle #chocolate #lespatisseries

A pretty looking waffle with lychee rose &amp; raspberry sorbet, fresh fruits and raspberry macaron topped on a pink rose waffle base. \n<br />Staff gave us strawberries and blueberries as they ran out of lychee and raspberries üò≠ that morning. \n<br />The waffle base felt a little lacking, tad dense and yet not quite crisp. \n<br />Do have to commend on the lovely raspberry sorbet, not too icy and didn\'t melt too quickly. A pronounced and refreshing raspberry flavour. \n<br />Overall a dessert dish of promising elements...its just that I prefer my waffles more crisp on the outside and airy fluffy inside. Maybe it\'s just that day since I read mostly good reviews... Hmm \n<br />#lespattisseries #lespattisseriessg #sgcafe #sgeats #sgcafefood #waffles #rosewaffle #sgfood #waffleispahan #foodspotting #whati8today #burpple
The lychee and raspberry sorbet was light and refreshing, SO GOOD! Sadly, I can\'t say the same for the rose waffle. The waffle was thick and chewy, a far cry from the awesome chocolate waffles I had on my last visit. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #waffles
I\'m in love with the Waffle Banoffee!! The waffle is crispy, the ice-cream has those rich taste of cream &amp; its very delicious! It cost ard $14 -$15, &amp; its definitely worth the try!!
Topped with crushed raspberry / lychee and a raspberry macaron !\n<br />Always hungry for some sweet #waffles ! Replacing scoopz, les patisseries is now a new cafe over there to give us more food choices when having a gathering at upp thomson! Be sure to check them out at wallet friendly prices! #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodporn #foodgram #foodgasm #foodgram #foodstagram #burpple #sgcafefood #hungrygowhere #dessertporn #food
Ray\'s treat. The cashier said that this is their signature tart. ü§î Maybe because I am not a hazelnut lover... My rating for this is just 2.5/5. But the crust was good. \n<br />#tarte #tart #pasteries #hazelnut #dessert #foodie #foodstagram #foodhunt #burrple
Too full for a full size waffle? They got this covered. Created my own half size double chocolate waffle [$4] + a scoop of rose and lychee sorbet [$4]. Awesome chocolate waffle with dark chocolate oozing out, paired with their unique rose and lychee sorbet. So much goodness in one plate. I WILL BE BACK. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #waffles #sorbet #lespatisseries
This awesome dessert is the Thai Milk Tea &amp; Earl Grey Waffle. Another epitome of Asian and western fusion. The crunchy waffle is made of blended earl grey tea leaves and topped with 2 scoops Thai milk tea ice cream and drizzled with condense milk. To make this dish so beautiful, they also added edible flowers, fresh fruits and a green tea macaron. I will definitely be back for more of this üòâüòâüòâ. #dessert #waffles #lespatisseries #EatSG #eatalone #jiakkaki #foodporn #foodie #localfood #sweettooth #burpple
Waffle toasted to perfection with a nice crisp on the outside. A portion good enough for 4 pax after lunch or dinner. One the best waffles around but limited choices of ice cream. #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodgasm #sgfoodporn #igsgfood #igsg #icecream #dessert #waffle #thomson #lespatisseries #newlocation #burpplesg #burpple

an unexpected find in my hood with #foodporn artist @tfortheodora lolol! it\'s good. I only wish that it\'s bigger hahhaha üòõ a pity that they\'re moving out of tpy by the end of this month when I just discovered them! üò¢ #burpple
Mango sorbet with rose flavour waffles topping up with raspberries &amp; lychee bits! My midweek waffles craving checked. üòâ #waffles #immawafflequeen #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #burpple
$8.50 for this work of art. I love the texture of the \'cake\'. Just wished it was fresh mango flesh inside and not jellied ones.
The macroon taste quite weird. Ah well.. I think Shrove tuesday is better compared to here. :P \n<br />#burpple #lespatisseriescafe #toapayohcentral

Everything is salted caramel including the waffles itself. 2 to share one is just right. #lespatisseriescafe #burpple #pepperminter25 #pepperminterfoodadventure

Simply get the Waffle Ispahan at Les Patisseries - it truly captures the taste and spirit of the original. Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh #Burpple
Thnk u thnk u üôèüôè the pink macaroon is rose flavoured while the one almost camouflaged into the plate is caramel both r equally awesome n way too sweet for my liking &gt;
Love the addition of the toasted almond! Don\'t think there\'s any liquor added here. The cake is moist and spongy but felt that the mascarpone cheese tasted stale, boohoo! $7
So so only. Flavour a bit too light. Can\'t taste any coffee, liqueur nor cheese taste. Texture light and fluffy. Overall I will only go back restaurant  if I\'m at that area. Not like today I went to hunt it down for the food.

Full story on blog.
They were labelled as Vanilla Macarons but they seemed like chocolate ones to me. I like how they did not crumble too messily with a bite, and there were feet as well. The chocolate was thick, but not too sweet and actually just right so that it does not become too jelak after downing one.
