Cheap yong tau foo ($0.30/pc not including egg) and nice soup too! Queue is super long during lunch hours. They seem to run out of rice so often.
My second choice when it comes to eating good food in school. Laksa gravy was decent and it\'s really cheap at 30 cents per piece! (Super long queue though)
Possibly my last bowl of Yong Tau Foo in a long, long time. :(
#Throwback Friday\'s lunch at The Deck\'s Sapore Italiano. Had pretty decent Carbonara, Aglio Olio and Hawaiian Pizza for a total of less than $20! ^(oo)^ Recommended if you\'re looking for smaller portions of Italian food at an economical price in NUS. #sharingtheloveofgoodfood #burpple
Homecoming is coming back to NUS and eat Yong Tau Foo
Last time eating my favourite laksa ytf in school :\'( this is my favourite ytf in singapore cos the laksa gravy is not oily unlike those sold outside. Really gonna miss this so much! 
School\'s awesome ytf for its price. $1.80 for 6 pieces+ noodles. Wanted laksa but they were out of it. No wonder my lecturer wanted to end tutorial early to eat ytf laksa!&gt;:(
Last few times here.
There\'s something about ayam panggang that keeps luring me back. The perfectly grilled chicken topped with a sweet black sauce with a thick curry gravy. Add chilli for that extra kick! Sweet, salty, spicy. All in one!
What’s for lunch at The Deck in @nus_singapore ?\n<br />Mala fragrant pot with 2 bowls of plain rice 🍚 at S$12.50\n<br />From Liang Ban Kung Fu Ma La Xiang Guo stall.\n<br />Huge serving!
Lunch at Dong Dong Food Express 東東砂煲美食 stall in The Deck in @NUS_Singapore\n<br />Ginger Onion Beef 🥩 with Potato 🥔 (S$4)\n<br />Pork Meatball Soup (S$3.50)\n<br />Curry Chicken 🐓 \n<br />Braised Cabbage \n<br />All claypot dishes were served with a bowl of plain rice.\n<br />If don’t want rice, discount $0.30.\n<br />Long queue but not as long as the Yong Tau Fu. Service was fast 💨
😍
Don\'t worry.
12 pieces for 12 days of Christmas? 😂😂😂
So comforting.....
Wah the queue so long!\n<br />I hate to queue for food but\n<br />Never mind, #Friday!
Lunch on a metal plate. #IndianFood
After so many years, still selling at $2!!
Located at 2nd floor air con area! One of my favorite food places in NUS! Able to choose the spicy degree and I always opt for the middle range. Love it ❤️
I am back for you! 😍😍😍
