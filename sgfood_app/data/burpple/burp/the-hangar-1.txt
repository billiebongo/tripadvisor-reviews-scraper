B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />How to make sure your meal at #thehangarsg ends on a fantastic note? Get their Half Baked Cookie Dough.\n<br />It is an ingenious dessert featuring a giant chocolate chip cookie in a 6-inch cast iron pan that\'s served with a big scoop of vanilla ice-cream and almond flakes. The surface of the piping hot cookie dough is crunchy but below that, it\'s nothing but wonderful chewiness filled with gobs of melted chocolate chips.\n<br />All the #burppletastemakers dining with me, gave this their thumbs-up too.
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />Had a great time here with the Burpple Tastemakers last night. Owner and coffee-and-food-extraordinaire Pav filled our bellies (and then some) with thirteen items from his new menu.\n<br />That man sure has a knack for creating audacious flavours. Take this Pulled Pork Kolo Mee for instance. What a bowlful of yumminess! Topped with a poached egg, the huge serving had juicy pieces of pulled pork and bouncy strands of egg noodles tossed in a light yet appetising sauce. Make sure to mix in the kickass Vietnamese chilli paste and salty ikan bilis evenly and the shiok-o-metre goes up, up, up!
Had scrambled eggs with toast and also ordered the cheesy Lebanese pita. Both were good! 
Located on Arab Street, this unpretentious cafe is unlike others on the list. It\'s dimly lit, they don\'t serve flowy eggs Benedict and they don\'t sugar coat or prettify their mains for the \'gram. But, it\'s also where you\'ll find downright satisfying mains, excellent coffee and a whole lot of fun going on (with a dope playlist in the background). Seating is limited, so come with two friends at most. Their menu has since been revamped to include items like the Halloumi &amp; Cauliflower Rice Salad ($16), a vegetarian dish so tasty you might just forget that there isn\'t any meat. Shaved cauliflower bits are pan-fried, combined with grilled zucchini, capers and a mustard dressing, and then stacked generously on a bed of mixed greens. The heaping pile of veggies is then blanketed with halloumi cheese, sliced eggplants, thyme-roasted tomatoes and a delicious housemade hummus. The owners are from Melbourne and they use Melbourne-sourced beans, so you know your coffee is in good hands. \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua
This is quickly becoming one of my favourite places for coffee.\n<br />Strong and boldly-flavoured espresso, paired with perfectly frothed milk. I could really taste the sweetness of the milk alone!
Having known that the owners were from Melbourne, I knew I had to get a coffee Australia was known for. Perfect microfoam and flavour, just like the coffee I had in Melbourne (and that\'s saying alot, because Melbourne is known for their coffee!). Best of all, it doesn\'t immediately hit you with a caffeine spike, but keeps you going all day. \n<br />+ Totally digging the vibes of this place. Will definitely come back to try their food, but for now, I know for certain it\'s a great place with great vibes and great people :)
This is ideal for those of you who don\'t like your sandwiches to have too high a bread-to-filling ratio because the pita used here is extremely thin. With a crisp finish, it creates a wonderful contrast to the hot, gooey filling of three kinds of slightly salty cheeses. Also compressed within are wilted spinach, and seasonings of dried mint and nigella seeds (also known as \"black cumin\"). \n<br />Despite their rather flat appearance, the sandwiches turned out to be surprisingly substantial due to the richness of the cheeses.
I was excited to see that the menu at what used to be my regular haunt, had been revamped and expanded. After much deliberation, I went for this vegetarian item.\n<br />Just to clarify, the \"rice\" in the bowl is not rice but tiny bits of shaved cauliflower. It\'s something I\'ve been wanting to try for a long time so I\'m really pleased to finally do so today. Better yet, I really dug the way it\'s prepared here by having been pan-fried a little. It\'s then combined with some grilled zucchini, capers and a grainy mustard-based dressing, and strewn generously on a bed of mixed greens. Laid neatly over all that were grilled slabs of chewy, salty halloumi cheese, sliced eggplant, thyme-roasted tomatoes and a fabulous housemade hummus. Altogether, they formed a hearty, healthy and delicious vegetarian meal.\n<br />I would have this again in a heartbeat but because I\'m just as keen to try the other new items on their menu, it\'s going to be a hard decision. Oh dear ü§£
Followed the recommendations and tried this Mexican chicken salad (I think it was $14.90 before 10% service charge). It was so banging! Seasoning and spices gave the dish depth of flavour and the guacamole was so on point! Dying to come back for more!
Super cool place to meet. Music place nicely at background allowing conversation to take place. The crowd is fantastic as well, having softly spoken conversation. We had the Mexican salad and the Cuban chicken sandwich. 
Bacon and egg roll with homemade tomato relish served with ciabatta // $10.90 // $12.90 for a breakfast set with coffee ($5 or below); top-up if coffee &gt; $5 // +chilled atmosphere with pleasant service 
This humble Arab Street cafe serves up hearty mains that are big on flavour. Seating is limited, so come with two friends at most. Try the Beef Shashuka ($22.90), a boldly flavoured one-pan meal featuring chunks of slow-roasted boneless beef ribs instead of the usual mince. For something lighter but no less punchy, try the Mexican Chicken Salad with Guacamole ($14.90) ‚Äî tender chargrilled chicken kebabs served with fantastic guacamole and fresh greens. The Smashed Fetta Avocado on Toast with lemon and fresh mint ($8.90) makes for a simple and refreshing breakfast; pay $11.90 to get the breakfast deal with coffee, which is excellent, or spice up your morning java fix with the Breakfast Bong ($9.90), a very unique concoction that combines avocado, espresso and vanilla.
\nHow can I not try this since it\'s recommended by Jayne Tan? True enough, there\'s a lot happening here that lifts it above the ordinary.\n<br />For starters, it isn\'t minced beef but slow-roasted boneless beef rib (in big chunks, mind you) that is mixed with a few thick slices of brinjal in the well-seasoned tomato gravy. An egg had been cracked into this pan of heartiness and covered with cheese before being popped into the grill. Hence, what you get is a piping hot solid meal. On top of that, the chef scatters roasted cumin to garnish, which gives the dish a distinct exotic aroma.\n<br />Personally, I would have preferred pita bread or some other soft bread because I think they would soak up the sauce better.
If you are planning to come here for their weekday lunch set (it includes a sandwich or wrap of your choice plus a coffee, tea or soft drink), I recommend trying the very tasty Cuban Chicken and Bacon Wrap. There\'s oozy melted cheese and lots of creamy guacamole packed in it. Fancy a healthier side? Pick the salad instead of chips. I like wolfing down my lunch with one of their potent cappuccinos. 
Cute lil\' Cold Brew Shots, complimentary from the wonderful people at @thehangarsg who gave us a fun Coffee Tasting sesh today. ‚òïÔ∏è #Burpple #BurppleSG #TastyTastemakerTour
A prize from Pav for being joint-winner at the coffee quiz alongside @coolheart (it\'s my first time winning at anything remotely academic related since primary school), Meantime\'s coffee porter can be quite simply and accurately described as a standard issue espresso that got Irished to the nth degree.
Pav surprised us all when he brought in this gargantuan slice of dark chocolate truffle cake during our coffee tasting. It was the sweetest surprise on our Tastemaker Tour, as the dark chocolate truffle cake was sweet, bitter, rich and moist in perfect proportions. In fact, it was so chocolatey that if The Hangar had bought the chocolate they\'d used off Willy Wonka, the crazy old chap would\'ve had to close shop with a sign reading \'sorry fam, but we\'re all out of chocolate!\' Better yet, it went really well with the Peruvian Gold Yin Yang coffee that we had the privilege of sampling. An absolute slice of heaven!
The Yin Yang ($5 a piccolo glass) coffee that was served to us on the third stop of the Tasty Tastemaker Tour after an extremely educational coffee class conducted by The Hangar\'s owner Pav. It\'s brewed from the Peruvian Gold (Bourbon Cajamarca) blend of beans and good Lord it was a massive wake up call. Bitter, nutty and with heavy cocoa notes, it served as an amazing afternoon pick me up. And massive thanks to Pav for being so generous and gifting every one of us a little potent cold brewed coffee shot each!
A great way to break away from the typical salad. Enjoyed the Mexican skewers and the smoked flavors. Perfect for my protein and greens diet. You\'ll leave feeling fulfilled! 
This hearty salad features exceedingly well marinated tender chicken chunks that\'s been skewered with onions and capsicums, and given a good grill. After being cloaked in an intoxicating smokiness, they\'re served on a bed of housemade guacamole, lettuce and baby tomatoes with slices of saut√©ed mushroom, croutons and tequila-soaked olives. I highly recommend trying this if you are tired of bland salads.
Coppa and Jamon Chorizo served with Brie Cheese and bread. All the slices were so fresh I couldn\'t stop myself from getting more! 
Average tasting cakes but would get them anyway hehe I love chilling at hangar because they serve a great cuppa and this place has super friendly baristas!! One of them came up with some milk and honey concoction and offered to let me have a sip!! 
Slathered on the chicken was a refreshingly zesty and spicy \"sambal\" that packed more seduction power than a purring Bond girl from any 007 movie. It zinged up the small but tastily grilled quarter of kampung chicken beautifully. Although modest in size, I felt this dish was well thought out and executed, with the chicken and rice accompanied by a simple \"tempeh\" and \"tau kwa\" salad plus a freshly-fried sunny-side-up egg.
A new section entitled \"Flavours of Asia\" now exists in The Hangar\'s menu. The emphasis of the four pretty sensibly-priced options (between $8.90 and $12.90 before service charge) seems to be on flavour and quality, but not so much size. I guess I can live with that because a lighter lunch helps fend off the dreaded food coma anyway. üòÅ\n<br />Heaped on the grilled slab of seabass was a fragrant housemade sambal chilli that provided a healthy whack of spiciness, which although not quite searing, made the Peranakan in me beam with satisfaction. I do wish the cold tofu in mirin sauce was more of a block than a nano-brick, so I gave feedback to the chef. Am keeping my fingers crossed he will consider enlarging it.\n
tucked away somewhere along Arab St this is a great place to chill and wait out the rain haha coffee is great mm no other words lor (low on acidity btw!!) and plus points for extremely friendly baristas :- ) sexy coffee indeed 
seeds are roasted in house and seem a darker roast because the bittersweet flavor is so pronounced. love it. sexiness is peaking
Was this inspired by The Hangar\'s location on Arab Street? Perhaps. What mattered most to me was that the colourful platter deliver a cacophony of flavours. And it did. The thin slices of kurobuta pork ham and the olive oil-saturated grilled capsicum were decent. I did find the bread too hard (pita bread would be a better match in my opinion) but their house-made garlicky hummus and tequila-soaked olives were stellar!
Filled with my 2 favourite drinks - Avocado &amp; Espresso! (menu wrote with a vanilla twist? Vanilla essence? Or probably a scoop of Vanilla ice cream? üòÜ) Ice cream for breakfast anytime! \n<br />I felt the avocado coffee is better well blended together (as the version from a cafe with vowels comes to mind), very smooth and less bitterness involved! HmMMmm... another cup please for me!
This would be my type of small breakfast; I like it how The Hangar could reproduce the old-school bakery bun without all that oily gloss that is brushed over the top which has become the de facto for neighbourhood bakeries these days. Served warm, the bun was soft, pillowy but oh-so comforting as you sink your teeth into that fluffiness. The desiccated coconut were subtly sweet; a wee bit local for cafe fare but honestly who cares because it\'s so good!
This is where The Hangar\'s cup of coffee gets sexy; they serve Signature Specialties which are in fact special concoctions with a mix of flavours that are pretty unique. A combination of Avocado and Espresso with \"a twist of Vanilla\", this was luscious, smooth and creamy; something similar to an avocado milkshake with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, with a shot of espresso so you could taste a subtle hint of coffee hiding somewhere. Not your typical wake-me-up, but definitely suffice perhaps as a dessert for a sweet ending!
Love the mirin that lends a sweet teriyaki-like flavour while staying light and slightly tangy. The salmon was also cooked perfectly, cutting open to reveal tender pink flesh. All that\'s good stopped here unfortunately. The quinoa was bland, edamame was sparse, the salad tasted simply sad. At S15.90, I\'d much rather top up 10 cents for a tastier and bigger quinoa bowl at Grain Tracers.
The chunks of steak were well-marinated and bursting with fragrance from the lemongrass. A shame it\'s under-seasoned and inconsistent, some bits overcooked, some bits utterly bland. Lucky for them the mustard mayo was pleasant enough and masked most of the inconsistencies. On the whole it\'s not too bad a steak sandwich, not the best but better than the average.
Ending the week with a hearty breakfast caffeine dose at Hangar. Been so long since I\'m back here and still attracted to the cool vibe.
With a little indie atmosphere, The Hangar serves up wonderful sandwiches. This lemongrass steak was juicy, tender and flavorful with caramelized onion and saut√©ed mushrooms but the edges of the toast was a little hard when served. But was really glad it comes in chunks of steak and not a steak patty! If the toast was served hot right after it being toasted, i reckon it will be much better.
The thick slab of deep-fried chicken was crispy and tender. Coupled with the sexy heat of the creamy chipotle sauce, the yumminess spectrum was broadened considerably. 
Quite liked how the barista immediately told me that she could offer me an Iced V60 after telling me there ain\'t Cold Brew available; that\'s good service! Was offered the Costa Rica blend; amidst the light fruity flavour, you could taste the heavy nutty and earthy punches in the body too. Really appreciate the skill and effort behind this one!
If not for the \"(Signature)\" that sits behind the name on the menu, I would have probably gone for something else since I had something similar the day before so I am glad I gave this a try. Lemongrass grass fed steak, caramalised onions, wild mushrooms and housemade horseradish sauce in between two slices of bread, I was mindblown by how good the combination worked! Really surprised how instead of beef fillet, the sandwich came with huge chunks of beef that was well-marinated with lemongrass so it comes with a light hint of the spice with every bite akin to Vietnamese pork chops. The caramalised onions and mushrooms gave it a sweet yet earthy flavour, but it was the sting of the horseradish sauce that gave it the x-factor with its signature numbness that tickled my tastebuds. A sandwich that I am definitely looking forward to have again!
Every day can feel like a weekend when you start on a sumptuous, scrumptious note. Take this breakfast for instance where a thick slice of sourdough is the yoga mat on which house-smoked salmon, creamy scrambled eggs, cooked spinach and a decadent dill sauce perform their sun salutations. Can anyone say YUMaste? üòÅüòÜ
A little tad too expensive for truffle fries? Definitely felt the salt and truffles!
This is one juicy &amp; creamy beef sandwich! Perfect for a afternoon bite before your planned dinner. This place has character.
This is the perfect fix for a hot afternoon! 
This came highly recommended by Vish, one of the resident baristas who also happens to make a mean cup of coffee. We obviously share similar tastes because I was impressed with every aspect of it. \n<br />Having been first marinated in yogurt and mixed spices, then skewered together with onions and capsicum for grilling, the boneless chunks of chicken were essentially flavour bombs of the tenderest kind. There was a smokiness about them that reminded me of tandoori chicken too... Such intensity needed to be tempered and doing a stellar job was the housemade couscous. Tossed in sherry vinaigrette, the small granules of pasta had cranberries, apricots and crumbled feta cheese added for colour, texture and taste. The final touch came in the form of fresh, raw vegetables - mixed salad leaves and fresh baby tomatoes. In summary, I\'d say this is a plate of exceptional tastiness. 
I absolutely loved this. Not only was its presentation gorgeous but the taste pleased my palate very much too. The salmon was browned nicely on the outside while remaining moist within - just the way I like my salmon. Giving the very lightly-dressed edamame quinoa salad a lift was a hint of refreshing mint.\n<br />I\'m so glad I discovered this today. It ticked all my boxes of being a heathy, tasty and filling lunch.
Who calls their sandwiches that?? Everyone seems to only review the lemongrass beef sandwich, so I thought I\'d feature something different. The fully sick sandwich is actually their version of a chicken sandwich, which was pretty standard with avocado etc, quite tasty! üåüüåüüåü
üò´üò´ Good morning everyone!! üòòüòò #SgCafe #CafeHoppingSG #TheHangar #CoffeeArt #Cuppa #ChasingShadows #ChasingHarshLight
My first thought was that the sandwich will be filled with slices of lemongrass. But to my surprise, I couldn\'t find any traces of lemongrass (this might not be a bad thing). The beef was so tender and together with the sweet caramelized onion, it was perfect. Definitely my top ten beef sandwich.\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />The Hangar\n<br />25 Arab Street Singapore 199724\n<br />Open from 8:30am ‚Äì 6pm (Mon-Sun), Brunch starts at 10am on the weekends
A hint of chocolatey taste and smooth nutty finish. Together with their lemongrass beef. Great place to have lunch and chill. .\n<br />|\n<br />The Hangar\n<br />25 Arab Street Singapore 199724\n<br />Open from 8:30am ‚Äì 6pm (Mon-Sun), Brunch starts at 10am on the weekends
Another soft-ish waffle--I seem to be encountering them often these days--this time for breakfast. It\'s served with natural yogurt, honey, one fresh strawberry and a few blueberries, which at $16, seems a little steep to me. So unless you are a complete waffle freak, I would recommend you go for the other items on their menu like their sandwiches and salads.
Once in a while I come across a blend that makes me sit up and take extra notice. The \"Apocalypse Now\" is a fine example. Made up of a majority of Vietnamese and Kenyan beans with a minor representation by the Balinese contingent, the result is sweet and chocolatey with hazelnut tones. According to Pav (owner-barista of The Hangar who does his own roasting), if you pay close attention, you can detect an aftertaste of maple and honey in this mildly acidic blend.
So, I started to freak out whether there was gonna be a class at all or whether I was gonna be the only one for class but there were eventually 4 people. But yeah, here\'s breakfast after! üòä
Lovely bread, great baked beans, and the rest...meh. Am only returning to try the sandwiches.
With a catchy tagline \"Coffee Sandwiches Salads &amp; Shit like that\", you can\'t resist giving it a try. Had a delicious cup of iced black coffee with a lemongrass steak sandwich. Sandwich was succulent. Nicely toasted bread, with a generous filling of camarelised onions, saut√©ed mushrooms to complement the chunks of beef steak.. trying my best to slowly bite in the sandwich to enjoy it longer.. will definitely come back.
Opened by an ex co-owner of Sarnies, The Hangar is a seriously chill spot with good, honest food. Their menu is focused on sandwiches and salads, with brunch offerings like Smashed Feta and Avocado on Toast ($8), and The Hangover ($20) ‚Äî a massive plate of eggs, sausages, mushrooms, beans, and toast. Albeit humble-looking, the sarnies here pack a load of flavour, and everything is made from scratch. Look out for their unique sandwiches such as Lotus Croqueroots (lotus root croquettes, $10), and the Lemongrass Steak ($12). Of course, no brunch is complete without coffee. Note that they roast their beans in-house!
Here for site visit at kampong glam but I had to fill my sad empty tummy first - and I loved this!!!!! ($18) topped with smoked salmon and eggs on sourdough. really liked the scrambled eggs (with spinach) and the dill aioli was delish. Only thing was the sourdough toast was a little too hard at the sides. A little oily but it\'s olive oil so it\'s fragrant and makes a whole lot of difference. 
You almost forget this is a vegetarian dish such is its powerful spectrum of tastiness. Lettuce leaves and grains of chewy couscous are dressed in olive oil and sherry vinegar. Perking up the mix is their aromatic housemade pesto, cranberries, apricots, cherry tomatoes and feta cheese. 
This was my very first taste of a cold brew with milk and it was a revelation! I found it to be much more intense and complex than the regular iced lattes I\'ve had. I swear there\'s even a distinct smokiness in there.
The combination of smashed avocado, crumbled goat feta cheese, bits of torn fresh mint, coarsely ground black pepper, lashings of olive oil and a generous squirt of lemon juice is absolute perfection. #thehangar #thehangarsg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #instafood #arabstreet #breakfast #brunch #partyinthemouth #burpple
Another day, another brekkie built. This consisted of two fried eggs, bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes and toast. Someone must\'ve been a little hungrier than usual üòÅ\n
Got a plate of stuff I like to kick off my day: Scrambled Eggs ($5) + Avocado ($4) + Mushrooms ($3). Because they use olive oil to fry everything (apart from the avocado of course), I didn\'t mind the slight oiliness. Coffee\'s always good here too. 
On the bed of shredded cabbage and organic sprouts was a juicy hunk of tender grass-fed steak that\'d been sliced into cubes. The fresh ginger dressing was really appetising - not spicy at all and much lighter than I\'d anticipated. Garnished with sweet fried shallots and coriander, this was exactly the sort of light lunch I needed today.
My tastebuds were quick to applaud the fantastic way all the flavours came together in this brunch item. In particular, I really liked the addition of spinach to the scrambled eggs. And that rich, creamy house-made dill aioli was swoon-worthy.
Enjoyed the Mexican Spice salad. Had the mochaccino... I\'m not sure if my tastebuds were affected by the taste of the salad dressing, but I thought it had an interesting taste, like there was marmite in the coffee. I don\'t hate it, just thought it tasted quite different from the usual coffee.
2 portions of lamb cutlets that were heavenly! Smell of the lamb meat was rather muted by the spices. Meat and fats were tender and well cooked! Love the thrill of the fats bursting in my mouth. Wasn\'t such a fan of the mashed potato, felt it was too mushy. The sauce took quite a while to accustom to but was great with the potato. Available during dinner, priced at $22.
Steak was a bit chewy at times but was well marinated, with a slight hint of lemongrass. Available during dinner, priced at $18.
Technically speaking, it\'s not a toastie but I \"chomp\" couldn\'t care less. My attention was \"chomp\" completely focused on \"chomp\" eating it and wondering \"chomp\" how a hint of garlic worked such wonders with the ultra-thin slices of Kurobuta ham \"chomp\" and thick pieces of \"chomp\" mild New Zealand cheddar. üòÅ
According to the friendly owner, this latest blend of his contains sweet caramel and honey notes with zero fruitiness. Due to his style of roasting, acidity is also really low. I just think it complements my read very well :)
I couldn\'t stop myself from ignoring my dining companion as I wolfed this down. Such rudeness was pardonable considering how tasty the bowl of zero-carb was. But that\'s the greedy pig in me talking üòÅ\n<br />Served warm, the mouthwatering pieces of grass-fed beef were lean yet tender. They had an enticing touch of lemongrass as well, with just the right sprinkle of salt. Besides the meat, there were a few cooked mushrooms tossed in with the lettuce, baby tomatoes and onions. A big dollop of, and I quote from their menu, \"bloody good guacamole\" was plonked on to liven up the salad further.\n<br />Yup, I can definitely see myself returning for this on a regular basis.
Visited the hangar during dinner and they don\'t serve their infamous sandwiches then.. So I settled for steak and yakitori. Even though their menu is nett priced, the dinner menu is quite pricey. The potato salad with the yakitori was delicious and the steak was so juicy and tender! Definitely want to try their sandwiches one day during lunch! 
After combing through so many caf√©s this year, and getting a bit jaded and bored (truthfully), The Hangar raised my senses again. Totally reminded me of the cool vibes in Melbourne. Worth a visit.
The hangar is a sexy coffee shop. Coffee and sandwiches taste good .If you like something organic can order one of the popular  \'end of the rainbow\', it\'s a jar of pure yogurt with many pretty fruits, can add on some pure honey if feel sour 
Love the mellow hint of spiciness from the sauce together with the spiced pork. Exciting and exotic flavours oozing from this sandwich!
The sourdough is fragrant though a bit tough and chewy. Smoked salmon was alright, not the freshest. Love how the whole dish came together from the spinach scrambled eggs, to the dill aioli! Yummy!
Don\'t, don\'t, don\'t order this. Unless you have a thing for soggy, airy waffles. And I guess we were indeed surprised, just in a bad way üò®
No idea what bread they use for this sandwich but I love it soo much cos it\'s so soft, moist, slightly chewy, and crispy at the crust. A perfect accompaniment to its simple filling of pork, lettuce, and tomato.
Forget everything you know about how lotus root should taste. It becomes practically unrecognisable after being mashed up, spiced up and transformed into the croquette that went between the slices of rye. Truth be told, it reminded me a lot of a \"falafel\", the Middle Eastern crunchy-on-the-outside, mealy-on-the-inside fried ball made of chickpeas and/or fava beans plus spices. Although I felt the croquette could have been less oily, it\'s a pretty unique vegetarian sandwich on the whole.
Crammed with flavour, this salad is great if you want a healthy lunch that doesn\'t compromise on taste. The pesto which is made fresh daily, is fabulously bold with a distinct punch of garlic. I did find a few pieces of the chicken breast (they\'re quite generous with the portion of meat) slightly dry but the pesto sauce helped to save the day. There\'re also blobs of feta cheese and sweet baby tomatoes grooving away amongst the mixed salad leaves to keep your tastebuds jumpin\'.
Prepared completely in-house, the pork has been cooked for 12 hours resulting in beautiful tenderness. What really makes this sandwich beyond yummy is the mildly spicy sauce that is slathered all over the pork. It\'s a guaranteed-to-get-your-juices-flowing blended concoction of grilled green chillies, garlic, fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of salt. In other words, it\'s similar to a \"salsa verde\". Keeping the pulled pork company between slices of rye bread were salad leaves and guacamole. Admittedly, the whole thing is a bit oily but I don\'t care. And my preference is to eat it with my hands for maximum \"shiok-ness\".\n<br />I\'d happily return to have this again very soon but the Lemongrass Steak Sandwich here looks equally promising. Going to have a hard time deciding on the two but nope, I am not complaining üòÑ\n
My latte was born of the quirkily/naughtily named \"Chocolate Starfish\" (go google it), a 50/50 blend of beans from Costa Rica and Papau New Guinea. It was sultry and smoky and everything your mother warned you about ;)\n<br />But seriously, Pav, the friendly owner of this new-ish cafe used to be a co-owner of Sarnies at Telok Ayer. So when it comes to coffee, I think it\'s safe to say you\'re in very good hands.
The Hangar, a sexy cafe-bistro serving good coffee, hearty sandwiches and salads, all day breakfast and brunch menu. I\'m having the Bangkok Beef Sandwich, comprising lemongrass grass fed steak, caramelized onions, japanese mushrooms and mixed lettuce.
Smoked Salmon, Capers, Dill &amp; Olive Oil dressing and Onions in a sandwich. This was fresh and delicious but it was just a safe combination, especially with the familiar flavours of smoked salmon and onions. The Dill &amp; Olive Oil dressing felt like a lighter alternative to Tartar sauce, which was more flavourful too!
I am a bit skeptical of fried chicken sandwiches in general, but this one got me on my knees begging for more! The chicken seemed to be pan-fried, this lightly crusted and also had a tinge of teriyaki marination for a Japanese flavour. Also intriguing was the Wasabi Mayo; it\'s not too strong, but it\'s not that weak as it was mildly numbing!
Roast Chicken, Basil Pesto and Greek Yoghurt. Chicken was chunky and flavourful; complimented well with that pesto that came with a hint of basil scent that\'s slightly tart from the Greek Yoghurt. Pretty delicious combination which was light on the palate at the same time.
They use El Salvador beans for their coffee here, which gives their cuppa a deep chocolatey flavour that was earthy as well.
I was told that it was prepared by their Japanese chef. Multi-grain bread is abit dry and hard. Even though the chicken breast meat is well marinated, it is a tad too dry and not juicy, due to long duration of pan frying. The colour of the fried chicken was dark brown instead of golden brown and one look can tell that it had been fried too long. The wasabi mayo dressing is abit light and only applied on the side with greens. In short, i didn\'t really enjoy eating it and had a difficult time trying to swallow the food. I even ended up drinking a full huge cup of water to swallow it.
So what is my bowl of kolo mee saying to you? \"I feel springy. Toss, mix, twirl or stretch even! Make sure I am smothered in all the seasonings, the oils and lotsa spicy chilli.\"\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Yes.... this is rather tasty. Pulled pork had a slight crisp at the sides. The egg was a tad overcooked. The chilli is damn shiok! I actually asked for more chilli which they obliged. Dumped the extra chilli in and did another round of tossing. Chilli-gasm literally. So addictive!\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Portion is generous. Can be shared among two. Me, myself and I got alittle \"jelak\" after finishing three quarters of the bowl. Noodles only. Chilli and pork were wiped out.
Didn\'t expect such a huge portion and is probably best to share as it got pretty heavy after a while. Liked the dish but didn\'t appreciate the mouldy toast üòë

üç≥\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPSüíÆ: Nothing mind blowing about this dish but it does reminds you of brunch food, it even taste like brunch. But I like how the tomato that\'s packed with umami bursts alongside golden yolk lava that flows from the river of nirvana. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />All of the items offered here are good but if you\'re here for brunch, you might wanna give this a go. BTW their coffee is awesome too. üññüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #thehangarsg #poachedegg #brunch #halloumi
üçú\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: A Curry Mee that pulls no punches, straight in your face full of Flavours, Spices &amp; Richness. This puts a number of places that specialise in Curry Mee to shame basically. ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />If every Vegetarian dish is created this way &amp; tasted this good, I don\'t mind being a vegetarian (at least for that meal) The components blinds so well together that I don\'t even crave any meat when consuming this bowl of goodness. üññüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #thehangarsg #halloumi #curry #noodles #vegetarian

Although it\'s texture and signature \'Maggie Mee\' curl is still there, it\'s taste is somewhat of a fusion \'East meet West\' kinda profile. It comes loaded with pull pork, anchovies, dry sambal, some garnish and most important, a poached egg waiting for a natural occurrence of \'Egg Porn!\'\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#sarawakkolomee#thehangar#pullpork#kolomee#kolonoodles#fusionfood#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
üçú\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Never would I\'ve thought that a cafe, much less a place open by an Australian that specialise in coffee made such a good bowl of Kolo Mee &amp; love use of Pulled Pork. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />Mix in thoroughly with that tongue tingling Vietnamese Chilli paste together with the ikan bilis for the full umami impact.

ü•ô\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Astounded to learn that The Hangar bake their own Sourdough, Ciabattas &amp; burger buns Everyday made me appreciate this sandwich more than the other boring sandwiches that many \'cafes\' offer. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />The star to me was the Sourdough, if only we had the chance to sample this straight out of the kitchen hot, cheese still melting &amp; a more toasted Sourdough.

What got me most interested during the tasting has got to be the Pulled Pork Kolo Mee ($14). My initial skepticism was along the lines on how a cafe famed for their coffee and sandwiches is able to pull off a bowl of kolo mee but I was totally sold by it at the end.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Breaking away from the tradition by using pulled pork instead of char siew was a genius way to give it an additional bite and the flavours combination totally knocked this dish out of the park, especially the special chilli mix, that promises a punch and one that lingers at the back of your tongue.\n<br />_________________\n<br />The Hangar\n<br />Address: 25, Arab Street, Singapore 199724\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #thehangarsg

Avocado &amp; Espresso with a Vanilla Twist
Finally did so with my bro &amp; woah. Totally falling in love with the vibes &amp; food over here. Had a Vanilla Latte ($6) &amp; ordered an item from the brunch menu, The Hangover ($26); a typical breakfast menu item consisting of the full works.\n<br />~\n<br />Heard many good things about the more unconventional offerings from this place &amp; we were really game to try them all but alas... there\'s only that much we can eat. Spied very interesting selections in the salad section including a Halloumi &amp; Cauliflower Rice ($16) &amp; Shrimp Avocado Taco ($16) but settled for the Pulled Pork Aussie Rice Bowl ($16) instead.

Part of The Hangar\'s new dinner menu are tacos - Short Rib Beef, Brazilian Spiced Chicken, Beer Battered Seabass and a vegetarian option of Tempeh Tofu. Tried all except the beef due to diet restrictions and the one that really stood out for me was the Beer Battered Seabass with purple cabbage, cilantro and their signature chipotle mayo. The combination of the crunch from the fish and purple cabbage, a spicy kick from the mayo plus the fragrant cilantro was yum. Would have liked the taco to be grilled a little more though! Get the tacos at $2 each till they sell out during The Hangar\'s Taco Fever happening on 5th March evening. (Give a call to confirm before going down!)

The Hangar is one of those places that serve coffee I actually enjoyed.  Unlike many other cafes that sources roasted beans from a supplier, The Hangar procure raw beans and roast it themselves (at a separate location of course).  $5.00
Have you heard about this off-the-menu #sandwich called \"The #Monstroski\"? Introduced to me by Jon the barista, my first bite of it had me whimpering in pleasure with its sexy combination of crisp bacon, creamy avocado, scrambled egg and a kickass chilli between slices of sourdough. No, you don\'t need a secret handshake or password to indulge in it but its availability is dependent on the mood of the chef. If you ask nicely and he has all the ingredients, he might deign to make you one :)\n<br />#thehangarsg #themonstroski #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #sgfood #arabstreet #cafefood #burpple

Came a bit too early for The Lab, so we decided to chill at The Hangar instead where we discovered this Brownie. While the Brownie lacks a crusty exterior, it\'s smoothness and richness is as though you are literally eating a slab of thick chocolate ganache.
