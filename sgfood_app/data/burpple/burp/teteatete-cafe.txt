Always happy to find new places at the vicinity of my office and tete-a-Tete is a great place to chill, being not overly crowded (yet). They have a good selection of cakes and French pastries as well as tea. And can I say their presentation is just lovely? 
We r having  raspberry terrine ($7.90), flourless blackforest cake ($7.90) and  lemon meringue tart ($6.90) paired with basilur tea (creamy fantasy ceylon green tea and strawberry &amp; kiwi tea)
With its wondrously high ceiling, spaciousness and Parisian-style chic, this is shaping up to be a good choice of hideaway from the madding crowd, and certainly lives up to its titular promise.
This is what we got for dessert in our lunch set. Reasonably cute and tasted just okay. But price wise value for money. The mousse is a bit heavy though the ice cream is yums. 
Bestie\'s selection for starter. Well seasoned and portion was good for lunch set 
Loved the minty taste of their iced mocha $6.60 
Chocolate tower $7.90 and lemon meringue tart $6.90 and iced mint mocha for a Tuesday after lunch indulgence
