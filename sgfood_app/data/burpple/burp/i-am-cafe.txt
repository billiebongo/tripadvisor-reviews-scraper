Birthday Feast for @alsonlsw with the clique on my Saturday book out!
Reallyyy big slice of cake for around $9ish and above? I cant remember but when you add the additional charges, its kinda of expensive. Not bad i would say and could share with your mates
Price: S$8.9
Baked garlic butter jumbo juicy prawns, baked half-shell mussels, soft shell crab, hot wings &amp; battered squid rings. \n
Green &amp; red peppers, onions, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, pineapple, mozzarella cheese and IAM house special pizza sauce. 
Price: S$8.90
From my point of view, I am Cafe is specialized on western food. I have been there for so many times and all I can say is I can\'t pick which one is my favorite dishes. The ambience is relaxing and calm. \n<br />Affordable price = big portion\n<br />The waiting time is not that bad. If you\'re going in a group I suggest you book the place in advance.\n<br />Thumbs up for this cafe 👍🏼
There\'s some kind of foods I cannot resist, and bacon is definitely one of them. So as soon as I saw the newest Boss Burger on I Am menu, I just couldn\'t resist. A perfect medium-cooked beef burger with caramelized onions, fresh tomato, a delicious white sauce and two generous slices of crispy bacon. It was really tasty, I will surely go back and try other burgers! 
Finally get to have lunch here. Tried their signature dish, Fish &amp; Chips. Very generous with the fries. The size of the fish is a bit big but the batter is very nice. Tastes different and original compared to other places that I\'ve tried.
Had a small gathering at I Am Cafe and it was surprisingly good. Food was pretty good and came in reasonably ok time given that there was so many people. And even though there was a lot of people, it did not feel squeezy which is rare for a cafe in bugis. Only bad thing about this is that the food is pretty expensive.
At I am cafe, as I was starving \'Double Trouble\' Beef Burger ($18.90) seems to be the obvious option. However the beef patties seems a bit too dry (that wasn\'t the case for \'Big Bear\' Burger) , but I quite like how the grilled pineapple complements the burger along with melted cheese. Go for their single patty burger ! They wouldn\'t disappoint....👌🏻
At i am cafe, the muslim-owned cafe. We ordered the Charcoal Grilled \'Big Bear\' Beef Burger ($15.90) because it looks photogenic in the menu 😂. It turned out as good as it looks. Their signature beef patty was juicy, along with battered onion rings, lettuce, tomato and runny sunny-side up egg. This affordable dish comes with a side of fries too.Will be back to try their popular rainbow cake. 🍰
$14.90 / serving. The pineapple ring boost the savoury level of this burger, a perfect combination. The fries, however, was a little too dry. 
Choose any dish you wish to eat and they will never disappoint you. The best. Affordable price! Good food. Good price!🙌🙌 
Visited Haji Lane for the first time with my friends. I love the variety of drinks here, so spoilt for choice 😍😍😍
Not what I expected but really delicious a good place for everyone to go 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 the price is very reasonable the cake is huge for $8.90 and the babycino milk is actually for babies but I think it suits any age 😆😆 amazed by the babycino would recommend people to try this drink  
I am cafe is a muslim owned cafe with food supplied by Muslim supplier source. So rest assured my muslim friends, this place is safe for your diet. I am finally trying their mains other than the infamous tall rainbow cake / crepe and red velvet cakes. Burgers seem to be their specialty. The big bear burger with thick beef patty and runny eggs are worth your calories. Pastas are well cooked but a little oily. Healthier option? Try the Cajun Chicken Aglio Olio. Chic N Turf Pizza is big and thin enough for all 5 of us to share. The butter knife provided made it hard for us to cut the pizza to smaller portion. No service charge here as minimal service available. But the staff are so friendly here. It was raining and they help to usher customers across the lane after payment. Remember to tip them for their Amsterdam trip. I hope the staff can go soon! I\'ve been seeing it for a couple of years.
🌼Rate: 7/10\n<br />The chicken was really nice but not really my fav :( but still, recommend to try this when you\'re at this cafe. :) This is for starters like me anyway HAHA
🌼Rate: 7/10\n<br />Its really really pretty. Love the ombre colour drink omg. But it\'s quite sweet tho. The red colour one is the sweetest lmao. Recommend to try it. 😉
🌼Rate: 8/10\n<br />So rare to see cakes with so many layers at once. Whats more, it\'s worth it to try! Really enjoy this cake 😍 sadly I can\'t really finish it lmao. RED VELVET LOVERS UNITE! 💪
Layer by layer goodness , drizzled with chocolate for only $8 . More worth it than the slice cakes in my opinion.
@gwumpyme\n<br />@shrkhemir\n<br />@hidstoryy
The patty was a bit burnt. Nice but they should grill the patty properly. A bit difficult to eat the burger. I don\'t know if there\'s a way to eat such huge burger. Fulfilling.
At $8 (before taxes) this is probably one of the most value-for-money cakes you can get! It\'s massive, and I can never resist those colours!! The cake is really dense, and slathered with cream cheese. Do not attempt this alone. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Everything was delicious and worth the money! Eat the fries after they soak up the juices from the beef patty for another party for your palate.
Overflowing food! The mussels in the platter were too much to handle.. in a very good way. Pizza was just like any other veggie pizzas. The burger patty was beefy! There was battered onion in the burger which was too oily for my liking. Nevertheless, the food and the price were just right.
Dinner last night [Cajun Chicken Aglio S$14.90] with spinach fettucine.
Last week I saw a long queue at Haji Lane for the I AM Cafe, so this week I come for tea and glad that no need to queue. I ordered a Mocktail with lychee, mint and lime which is very refreshing. For cake, they\'ve got a big rainbow cake and a slice of rainbow crepe cake in the same price ($8), that both catches my eyes, but I choose the slice finally... taste a bit different in each layer and feeling good, not too sweet but taste nice. My friend ordered a grilled chicken burger and it\'s also not bad. 
Mixed Platter ($18.90) of Baked Garlic Butter Prawns and Mussels, Hot Wings, Battered Soft Shell Crab and Calamari. Fried really well - crispy and not overly oily.
I\'m seriously not a fan of beef related food, but this burger has to be the real deal. It is such a pleasure when you break the sunny side up and the egg yolk drips (sounds creepy but it gives me a \'wow look at that\' feeling). I couldn\'t finish the burger because it was too filling for myself to handle. The sauce mixes really well with the patty, and not to forget the battered onion rings, my favourite of all, makes the burger \'not that average looking\'. Fries was pretty decent and price was alright for a filling burger. 🍔 But GST charge for the whole meal was 10%(damn the gov sorry if I\'m being blunt about it), which was 5$+. 😒 Apart from that we have a great meal there, though I would love a more spacious space for the cafe to move around and the chair not designed in gap-wooden style (pity the girls who wear shorts, they would end up have that line thingy on their skin when they stand up).
I personally like fish n chips, but won\'t recommend to eat at a cafe, because you can get even better mains apart from Fish N Chips. Hawker centre fish n chips is less than $7, so why get it in cafe which can cost &gt;15$. But this is just my personal preference. Back to this Fish N Chips that I ate at I Am Cafe in Haji Lane, it is really nice, however average. My tastebuds felt bored after eating halfway through the fish. I would recommend all cafes to a small portion of greens or salads at the side so it would be more balanced. We actually wanted to order salad as a side dish, but apparently I Am Cafe doesn\'t offer that, only deep fried food as sides, which is kind of a disappointment. To all the cafes out there, if you are serving Fish N Chips, please add some greens and salads at the side. The meal would be more balanced this way. 😊
Ham &amp; Cheese Sandwich for $12.90. Sounds light-meal and not appetizing? NO, it is appetizing and it can be filling. It\'s served on a wooden board which consist of ceasar salad and two triangular sandwiches. A sandwich will have some sauces, leafy greens, tomatoes and some cheese. But don\'t worry to reconfirm, just read the description provided below each meal on the menu. The downside is the ham is quite salty on that day it was bought, I hope it\'s not always have been like that! Overall, my first time trying out the food there has been pleasant. Btw, the place is limited on seats so try your luck! A HEADS UP: A 10% Service Charge incurs = $2.98. Cheers, happy eating! 
Meatball Sandwich for $12.90. Seems expensive and is it worth the money? YES it is. A decision I didn\'t regret. If you love beef or MEATBALLS to be precise, you must try this! It will be served on a wooden board which consist of ceasar salad and TWO satisfying triangular sandwiches. A sandwich is filled with tomatoes, sauce, leafy greens and slices of meatballs - perfection, not too dry or salty. Don\'t worry what each meal contains as there\'ll be description stated. A HEADS UP: 10% Service Charge incurs =$2.98. Overall, ordering a Meatball Sandwich on a first visit is not disappointing at all. Cheers, happy eating! 
Sauce was abit too creamy. Pasta was a little hard. Service was a plus point. Rating: 3/5
I visit thr on a rainy and crowded (tues)day, I waited for abt 15mins and got a seat by the side and it was raining so heavily, splashes was all ard. I got this Hotstuff Beefy Jumbo for $10.90 which I ate in a hurry without taking a photo first as I was starving.&gt;
3 munchies: There was nothing to shout about for the coffee, starter dishes – Cheezy Bombs and Hot Wings, and Fish \'N\' Chips. I\'d only recommend the Cajun-spiced Grilled Chicken Burger and Pesto Portobello Burger that come with I Am\'s signature crispy thick-cut fries. The great ambiance and service at this Amsterdam-inspired cafe were also appreciated!
i want that red velvet~ i want that sugar sweet~ dont let nobody touch it unless that somebody is me~
One of the most value-for-money burgers I\'ve ever eaten. Serving was indeed generous!
There\'s something inherently lovely about marshmallows. Their pillowy softness, especially when slightly golden and gooey from being toasted, is heavenly in desserts. The magic is apparent in this tart where they blanket a sea of dark chocolate ganache atop a chocolate crust base. I like it paired with a glass of I Am Cafe\'s unsweetened house-made Ice Lemon Tea. 
From fish and chips to burgers to hot dogs, I Am is where you want to be with your friends this long weekend! Finish your meal with a lovely slice of Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel.
If it was served more chilled it will definitely be better!
This Amsterdam-inspired café has gained widespread popularity since their opening, attracting diners by the dozen to their humble, airy space at the head of Haji Lane. Their unexpectedly good food is what brings diners back again and again, especially for their fried seafood, hearty burgers and beautifully layered cakes. Go for the Fish &amp; Chips ($15.90), and the Charcoal-grilled Juicy Beef Burger ($13.90). Perfect for small group gatherings, there\'s even a great vegetarian option — the Pesto Portobello Burger ($14.90). Split a decadent Chocolate Salted Caramel slice ($8.90) to end off your meal! \n<br />*Muslim-owned, Halal-certified suppliers
I Am... IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.\n<br />The ease with which I can get my greedy paws on this bowl of piping hot babies is worrying - my office is just a few metres away from the cafe! 😳\n<br />Seriously, how can anyone resist the shatteringly-crisp coating of batter that gives way to the spicy, slightly vinegary kick of the jalapeño pepper holding all that ooey-gooey-liquidy-hot cheese within? I also can\'t think of anything better to swish the jalapeño popper in than that accompanying fresh cucumber dill dip 😋\n<br />My poor, poor waistline.
Fish and chips was nice. Abit too oily for me. But its nice. Price was reasonable. Serving was small, but tasted good. 
Charcoal-grilled Juicy Beef Burger which comes with charcoal-grilled beef patty topped with pineapple, onions and melted cheese. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/20-halal-cafes-in-singapore/
If you are thinkingg that eating hotdog is too mainstream, you are wrong. Pretty much because you are going to miss out a real good main dish. Their bun are so soft that it goes so well with their homemade sauce and beef hotdog. I have no complaints for the food i ate here. 
The thick cut fries, which is their signature starter, are crispy and not too much to handle. Liked the burger in general, juicy from the portobello mushroom and flavorful from the sundried tomato just beneath the lettuce. Recommended for the vege-lovers!
For those red velvet lover,this is one of the best red velvet cake i ever tasted!
It\'s big and I had to share with my friend. The cake is moist and delicious.
The chicken feeling is alot and the satay sauce is delicious. Not forgetting the nice ambience and excellent customer service by the staffs..
Located at Bugis area, and probably a 15 mins walk from Bugis Mrt. This is a place where everyone is oogling over their signature rainbow crepes and cakes, i\'m all in for the meal set! I\'ve tried the rainbow crepe and cakes, and for once i felt that the long wait wasn\'t at all worth it. However, i gave a second try and tried the meal and it\'s so goood! The pictures tells it all, and i\'m in love with the burger. Forgot how much it costs me, but come on, how about giving their awesome meal a go! Promise you, I Am won\'t disappoint! Alongside with this, i had lychee mint mojito. Not for you non-mint lovers for sure! But, a good try! 
One of the best platters I have eaten! The cheese mussels is flavourful, seasoned deep fried soft shell crab, juicy prawns and sweet BBQ sauce wings! 😍😍😍
Heard much reviews about their burgers. Tried and tasted and indeed what makes it unique is the specially concoted sauce! Worth it!
Awesome sauce! A dish on promotion atm, this pasta was done to perfecto. Pasta craving - satisfied!
Chocolate salted caramel with buttercream, surprisingly better than the rainbow cake 
It came with a portion of fries too. The burger is made up of 1 layer of onion ring, a layer of pineapple slice and the juicy patty. Overall the burger taste is not bad, sweet and juicy from the pineapple ring and meat patty.
How can you not exclaim in delight when you first glimpse this massive slab of indulgence? The cake itself is a wonderful deep dark chocolate interspersed and coated all over in buttercream frosting. Fortunately it isn\'t too sweet, which sets it up nicely for the generous squiggle of superbly rich sea salt caramel sauce added by the service team just before it is presented at your table.\n<br />If you are looking for a dessert to share among friends, this is a great choice.
Love the east meets west combo!
Perfect for kids 
(Not in picture: Matcha Latte • A little too sweet for my liking x Fries and Mayo • Nicely done and not like the usual ones we see outside)
Tried two burgers (pretty normal), soft shell crab (a bit too oily), cheesy meatballs (that is really legit because cheese really do explode out and splatter all over-that\'s what happened to me) and salted caramel cake (very moist but because the servings is huge, it\'s better to share with people so it doesn\'t get too jelat towards the ending)!
Charcoaled beef patty with some greens,battered onion rings and a sunny side up!$15.90?Definitely worth the bucks!😋 
Chicken and turkey ham with mustard and mozzarella cheese!That for $14.90!😋  
Charcoal grilled beef patty with pineapples,onions and melted cheese!That for $13.90!😋
A portion of baked garlic butter prawns,mussels,soft shell crab,hot wings and battered squid for $18.90!😋
Be very, very careful when you bite into one of these babies because they can literally explode! Filled with a liquid lava centre of nacho cheese, the firm, bouncy ball itself is made from tasty chicken meat, creating a highly addictive munchie.\n<br />Cheesy Bombs (how cute is that name!) is the kind of small dish you order to share but end up wishing you had an entire bowl all to yourself 😋
Really love the moist texture of it, the cream cheese blended in well with the cake and also value for money with the price of a slice. 👍👍👍👍
Nice food.. one of the best we have tasted.. the rainbow cake however not so...
So glad that the 10 weeks of attachment is ending!! I have definitely left a part of me here. Feel so blessed with all the words, presents and hugs. :\') I actually can\'t wait to come back!😁 happy mid week everyone! ^^ Ps: was quite disappointed that the rainbow crepe was sold out. 😭
I am someone who doesn\'t like to eat dessert. But I am willing to go all the way back again just to eat this. No captions needed. 
Great for sharing.
Delicious 
Sincerely delicious, good portion of serving, reasonable price, nice atmosphere although prefer to have more seatings. 
The combination of good ambience and good food is always a winner in my book\n
Food &amp; service @ I Am Cafe = 5/5! Really good food &amp; wonderful service
Densely moist,  creamy cheese,  a size so huge probably would need 3 pax to finish the cake. Happily satisfied.
I Am cafe has attracted diners by the dozen to their humble, airy space at Haji Lane since its opening. Their unexpectedly good food is what brings diners back again and again. At Cafe Fest, expect their signature fries &amp; mayo, which can be accompanied by extra dips - garlic mint, cucumber dill, and sweet honey mustard. Wash it all down with a cup of fizzy lemonade! *Muslim-owned, not Halal-certified but Halal supplier
This is one of the new burgers on I Am Cafe\'s revamped menu. I found the homemade beef patty to be slightly chewy but very well marinated with lots of spices. As flavourful as the patty was, it got even more \"shiok\" with the perfect sidekick - a thick, sweet slice of pineapple. Melted cheese and sweet chilli mayo sauce rounded off my gastronomic fulfillment.
Try it for novelty\'s sake, the texture was off, and it\'s basically just eating a tasteless crepe with chocolate sauce!
Rich coffee flavor with a very beautiful coffee art on top... 
You\'ll be surprised at how much better this tastes in comparison to its very basic description. Just the ciabatta bread itself was amazing as it\'s fragrant with olive oil. The filling of turkey ham, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes was boosted with I Am Cafe\'s tasty sweetish homemade sauce. The side of Caesar Salad gourmet-ified the sandwich even more. I was so stuffed after eating this awesome sandwich. 
Travelling all the way from the Netherlands to accompany my cup of cappucino is the unique Stroopfel. Formed by two very thin wafers sandwiched together with caramel (that has a hint of cinnamon) in between, it\'s meant to be placed over a hot cup of coffee. This allows the heat from it to soften the caramel, making it slightly oozy as you munch on the Stroopfel. It tastes really lovely with sips of coffee.
Food here is great! Okay it was based on only one visit but it definitely calls for more upcoming trips. Only thing holding me back is the long queue that is to be expected at certain timings as they do not take reservations so you really have to see your luck. Wasn\'t very hungry so I ordered a hotdog bun kinda thing and it was really quite filling and tastes just awesome. This place also sells cake slices in humongous servings, how tempting is that?
Reasonably priced at $10.90. The staffs were friendly! Generous amount of their homemade sauce on top of the jumbo chix sausage! Definitely something that will delight your taste buds!
Surprisingly priced at $8.90. Quite cheap I must say. A classic 8\'\' chix sausage topped with their spicy mayo sauce and mustard and bits of onions and relish. Generous amount of fries for side dish. Definitely recommend this if you like that ol\' classic hotdog bun!
The meatballs pizza was awesome. The cheese was as generous as the Surf N Turf. The meatball tasted homemade as the meat was fresh &amp; it is really made up of meat as compared to the processed ones in the supermarket. 
Fish and chips; specialty of I am. The fish is quite light and soft on the inside and the batter is quite crispy. Perfect combination. Paired up this fish with their iced Mochalicious(perfect for those who are a coffee and chocolate lovers). Two thumbs up!
Finally got to taste this rainbow crepes! Coloring and presentation is nice. But the taste of it is a huge disappointment. The crepes is too dry and it does not taste like what I expected. Nevertheless is a great dining over there. Try their cake it\'s taste so much better  
IAM Cafe\'s coffees are made from beans blended and roasted exclusively for them. Medium in body and acidity, they have a nutty flavour with hints of chocolate. I am no expert in coffee lingo so I checked with the friendly barista for that description :) My favourite drink drink to order whenever I\'m here is the cappuccino. 
Who can say no to a juicy ground beef patty accompanied by a tangy pineapple ring? Not me.
Size does matter when it comes to hot dogs and this is one of the bigger ones I have seen. The beef sausage that had a nice firm bite, was topped with a savoury brown sauce, chopped raw onions and dried herbs. It\'s generous proportion makes it pretty filling for what is usually considered a snack food.
This is so good! Ask for this if they have it. Please read my full review at https://www.xiaoyangmeimei.blogspot.sg
This is one of their signature drinks. Please read my full review at https://www.xiaoyangmeimei.blogspot.sg
Great fish &amp; chips &amp; satay burger! The calamari were real coated squids! Yummy!
Under the wittily-named header \"Responsible Cocktails\", you\'ll find the \"Bushramint\", a signature non-alcoholic drink at this popular cafe (Note: all drinks here are alcohol-free). This citrusy tall drink is generously filled with orange slices and mint leaves, making it more than apt for our hot weather. Just want to commend on their awesome service too. I requested to reduce the sweetness of my drink and it was carried out perfectly. The bartender even came by himself to check if he had made it to my satisfaction. Wow.\n
Between the soft buns is a prettily curled piece of fried dory fish fillet that sits on a cheese slice, while holding a dollop of tartare sauce. The fish\'s crunchy coating and the juicy flakiness within was absolutely sublime. Will be back for this again soon.
It a good experience to go there and try out their dishes and rainbow cake. It a good try for this place. a lot of ppl was there having their lunch/dinner. 
Waiting for someone you love under the scorching sun on a friday noon? I am cafe izzz so pretty, it helps you to cultivate your virtue. 😉😉
It is one of the signature dishes at this popular corner cafe. Upon being served, it tends to elicit a few \"wow\'s\" due to the attractive presentation - they perch the large sized fish on the pile of chips. The batter used creates an incredibly light coating and isn\'t greasy or heavy in any way. Made from real potatoes (you can still see the skin on them), the chips are wonderfully delicious. Priced at $15.90 before taxes, you can see why this dish is a must-order and appears on nearly every table.
$8.90 - The consistency of the cake was very good, moist &amp; soft, yet it had a firm structure just so it would easily fall apart. The cream was unique as I\'d usually expect something like cream cheese, or someth along that taste but instead it had a lime taste to it, if I\'m not wrong, which suprised me. But it was great, filling piece of cake! 
It was all right. Expected more. But w great company, it\'ll taste better:) 
Not too cheesy and not too dry. Just nice for something without meat. 
Chocolate and marshmallows all in one plate. Definitely for people who love desserts! 
Dining here was kind of a claustrophobic\'s nightmare but the food made up for it. The fish was fried to crisp perfection but we got sick of the taste of too much fries and the beef burger after a while. Good experience! Spent $70+ for 3 people, including dessert. 
1st bite was okay, then I got a bit tired of eating the whole thing.
Went there about 3 weeks ago and honestly I expected the bread to be tough and all but it was really soft and the fries were pretty good too!Really wanna go back again to try their highly raved about rainbow crepe!The brunch menu looks amaaaazing too!!
First time visiting I Am Cafe &amp; I must say, I was impressed with the concept. The food was delicious &amp; I am definitely coming back for their cakes. It looked so good!
#100happydays day 3! A rainbow cake to share between 8 friends 😄
Decent! 👌
This Rainbow Mille crepe looks so good and appetizing, $8.90. With chocolate in each layer underneath each crepe. And you\'ll notice that almost every table had a slice of their rainbow cake/crepe!
not too creamy, and the portion is just nice. But I think they can do better with the meatballs, perhaps a little more spice.. :p
One of the dishes for their brunch. It was good and filling. $12.90 if I\'m not wrong. Oh, their bushramint is worth the try too! 
Worth the price as the size is big! It tastes goooood. Good for sharing with 2 or more people. 
When life gets you down, have a rainbow crepe to keep u up. Love the name of the shop... I AM.
Fresh and oh so delectable. And how that pretty like cake brings smile to your face.
Another halal/muslim owned gourmet menu to try! It\'s so-so though, but it\'d be great if their servings are slightly more.
So beautiful and yummy!!! I really like it.. #cake #rainbow #foodspotting
This cake would surely make anyone smile. Sandwiched in between the layers of brightly colored crepes is a chocolate cream. You would expect it to be cloyingly sweet but it actually isn\'t.
$8.9, just creep w layer of chocolate spree on it.
We couldn\'t resist trying out this slice of  rainbow goodness. An interesting multi-layered consistency accompanied with chocolate in between the layers. I wouldn\'t be back for this, but it was worth trying once. $8.90, 4/5
Somewhere over the rainbow! 🌈

This evening, I had the chance to taste. As a first-timer, the safest food to order is the one recommended in the menu. It didn\'t disappoint in terms of taste and satisfaction. However, the patty was quite chewy but anyway, it was juicy. It all that matters for someone who just want the food to live up to its name. HAHA 😂 And it was super filling!!! I ordered Matcha Latte because it\'s Matcha, what else?! 😄 Okay, nothing to shout about. But I\'ll say something, it was very light. So light that I wasn\'t satisfied with its being Matcha. 😒\n<br />#burpple #iam #burgerlove #matchalatte
Rainbow crepe cake drizzled with chocolate sauce.
But..since im here, y not get a piece! \n<br />Their unmistakable giant size rainbow cakes taste alright to me.. it\'s more of a cheese cream rainbow cake actually.. so it\'s refreshing that there\'s some variation but due to its eromous size, it can get \'jelak!\' So this is best enjoyed when sharing👌🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#halalsg#iamcafe#cakesg#rainbowcake#cake#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending

The service are not good.
Awesome!
Refreshing!
I Am Cafe at Haji Lane (yes, it\'s a halal cafe!) does some incredible food with generous portions at reasonable prices. Esp. loved that satay sauce and fresh cut fries. Uber addictive.

It was recommended that a little tobasco sauce be added to lift the taste. Didn\'t think there was a difference though. The deep fried items reeked of reused oil while the chicken wings had too much BBQ sauce to it\'s taste. 👍👍\n<br />#burpple #pickyeaterssg #igsg #iamcafe #iamcafesg #instafood #sgfood #sgfoodlover #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sg #chickenwings #foodplatter #mussels #prawns #softshelledcrab #sgfoodie #sgcafehopping #cafehopping #foodcoma #foodgasm #foodpics #foodspotting #foodphotography #foodstamping #foodinsg #dinner #cafehunting #8dayseatout
The moisture &amp; sweetness is just nice. They are quite generous with the portion for the price of $8.90 a piece. 👍👍👍👍
Thank you for listening to my rants. Can\'t thank you enough 💕

Thats the Beef BurGer.. Cheesy Chick Balls.. Jumbo Beef Sausage
The Surf N Turf pizza was dope! The pizza had a generous amount of cheese &amp; meat. The mustard served on top of it complements the pizza completely. The thin crust was just nice! Totally recommend it for anyone who loves thin crust &amp; cheese! Ps. It\'s better to share it if you are not a big eater.
The colours totally lift my spirits! $8.90 per pc.
It looked better than it tasted. :(

It\'s so colorful, it attracted my eyes! It doesnt taste that bad either! The chocolate adds on the texture. The portion is just nice. But be careful! It\'s pretty difficult to slice it using a fork. Maybe eating it slice by slice is easier. 
The one at the bottom is creamy based pasta with turkey bacon and the top one is tomato based pasta with homemade meatballs! Both tastes equally good and it was scrumptious! 👍
A little bit pricey but good experience! 😊
Everyone wants happiness, \n<br />No one wants pain,\n<br />But you can\'t have a rainbow,\n<br />Without a little rain! ☔🌈😊💖✨

Haa when stressed eat desserts :D
Rainbow crepe with @pohsio
Rainbow cake and rainbow crepe. Most cafés uses coloring. #rainbow #cake #dessert #cafe #sgfood #foodporn #travel #singapore #hajilane
However the service was really bad. 
love thick cut fries with potato skins not entirely skinned
plenty of toppings on thin crispy crust, addictive!!
Has this tutti frutti taste and it tastes super good! One thing that is unique is that it has no alcohol inside and it is a really one of a kind drink :) 
rainbow and chocolate, sucha perfect combo! 👍
🌈 cake + 🌈 crepe. Shiokkkkkkkkkkkk 😍
...
Ain\'t a tart lover but this was exceptional. 👍
Of all the rainbow cakes I have eaten so far, I think this Rainbow Mille Crepe Cake taste the best. Probably becos of the chocolate inbetween the layers.

Love the rainbow crepe &amp; s\'mores cake!
