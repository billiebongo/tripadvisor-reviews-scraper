Still think that Alfero\'s pistachio is unbeatable, but the hazelnut flavour is a star here!
The much anticipated Gelato bar at Boat Quay, featuring the Bitter Chocolate, Mango Sorbetto, Pistachio and Coconut gelato, a cool taste of Italy.
Essentially a valentine to the Rossini cocktail. The strawberry sorbet was sublime, and truly tasted like (icy) fresh pur√©ed strawberries‚Ä¶or that could be what my rather buzzed mind was telling me, as the prosecco was as ruthlessly efficient as a ninja in accomplishing its mission to make me really, really happy. 4.2/5
Plus39 Gelato Bar joins the busy crowd at Circular Road, providing icy relief to CDB folks with their freshly prepared gelato. While prices may be higher than most gelato places, be assured that you\'re paying a premium for quality ‚Äî Gelato Coach Jacopo Quaglia knows his stuff and you can taste it in the gelato, which possesses a silky smoothness rivalled by few. Flavours are rotated daily, but if you can, don\'t hesitate to go for the undeniably good Pistachio or the intriguing Chilli Chocolate gelatos. Alternatively, dig into the very alcoholic frozen Spritz made with Aperol if you\'ve had a very rough day at the office. 
So smooth and so light yet the taste is prominent in each flavour. It is good to know that everything is made with fresh ingredients instead of using anything artificial. üòçüòçüòç The pistachios n strawberry gelato here won my heartüíñüíûüíï
Two ball gagging into the mouth. What a big nut, she said. So creamy and thick that it slides down the throat so smoothly. It was definitely a good hazelnut gelato.
The alcohol-gelato pairing of the day. Apple Sorbet comes doused in Aperol; an Italian alcohol that\'s made with rhubarb, bitter orange etc. Pretty much an acquired taste, you get a bit of fizz accompanying the bitter alcohol and sourish sorbet together. Doesn\'t really hit me, but alcoholics would love this!
Unbelievably smooth and thick with its rich nutty flavours despite having no hazelnut bits to crunch on, the dine-in cups comes with a variety of liquid toppings at no additional charge. Chocolate was thick and came in globs that was sinfully sweet and came with wafer-esque crisps to crunch, while the chestnut was more subtle and earthy despite its thickness. Cherry was rather sweet with some cherry bits to bite. Can get a bit jelak after a while.
Do head down if you are near circular road! It\'s pretty awesome. Love the Pistachio &amp; the chilli chocolate. Tried the Frozen spritz which consists of aprerol sorbet with zardetto on top!
Home alone on a Friday night. üòî I need some ice cream.
I CANNOT express just how thrilled I am that @plus39gelato is opening less than a minute\'s walk away from my workplace. Expanding waistlines be damned, because every calorie in this less-than-10%-fat gelato is more than worth it.
prolly gonna be the best around for some time.
Managed to try out the gelato at #plus39gelato before their soft launch next week. The raspberry sorbet was intense in its sourness and a wallop of natural, fruity goodness right there in your mouth. The revelation, however, was the choco ginger - dark, bitter chocolate with this sexy, sensual ginger spiciness at the tail end that made me wonder why these two didn\'t shag much earlier. Dead excited about their waffle and fruit salad menu, as well as their alcohol-ice cream pairing! 4.1/5
can never go wrong with waffles and gelato! 
One flavour together with three toppings cost $5.

Pistachio and Hazelnut creamy and I mean, creamy (read: super yummy!) gelato at @plus39gelato (right opposite √î Comptoir!) @_winnie.h_ and I tested one flavour each and we were like \"wow this is good! and then \"WOW THIS IS GOOD\" and so we had both the flavours we tested. would have really liked to try their waffles if we weren\'t already too full (and sleepy). maybe next time!  @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia #singapore #dessert #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgcafe #sgcafehopping @cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood @sgcafefood @sgfoodie #gelato #icecream

Second in the world, first in APAC! Yup, it cost a bomb as well for the machine most importantly it\'s made freshly and lesser stabilizer needed. #yummy #icecream #desserts #foodie #pistachio #foodstagram #cafesg #gelato #burpple
Semifreddo is Italian for \"semi-frozen\". Produced in limited amounts, they come in different flavours, with this one being the only single one sold while the others is sold in a platter of three (and they seemed like they had only made these four to be sold). Inside the mango nappage (which is somewhat like a gel) lies a rich vanilla gelato which is speckled with vanilla beans; aromatic and thick while covered in a slightly tart mango gel, and with a chocolate pochee (the chocolate that seems to be \"leaking\"). Served out of the fridge, it was advised that you should wait for about 10mins before indulging so as to allow the dessert to defrost to its intended texture.

Pistachio gelato at $7.50/ scoop but so worth it. If you can pay $7.50 for a slice of cake, you must try this üç¶\n<br />#VSCOcam #vscosg #vscofood #sgcafe #sgeats #sgcafefood #food52 #gelato #pistachio #burpple

Would be happy to have this everyday!
Indeed the pistachio gelato is really good as recommended by many.
Mango Sorbet &amp; Strawberries with Cinnamon drizzle with strawberries sauce, served in frozen metal coppa cup ($9.90 for 2 scoops). It\'s a refreshing change from the chocolate gelato and I love it as well. We also had a discussion with Chef Jacopo &amp; his friends on what IGers want to see vs what Chefs like to prepare that day. Wonder what\'s the conclusion now üòä Anyway do pop by this month, there\'s a promotion going on whereby you can buy 2 cups and get 1 more free!!
you get that after taste of sensory spiciness after de mouthful of chocolate.
This is plus39gelato for 39 is the country code for Italy .... Now u geddit? :)\n<br />#plus39gelato #gelato #icecream #pistachio #strawberry #dessert #yums #sgig #sgfood #food #foodgasm #foodporn #foodstagram #igsg #burpple
