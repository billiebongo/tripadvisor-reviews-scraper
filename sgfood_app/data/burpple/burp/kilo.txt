As it typically signifies the end of a meal, it is only fitting that this is the last post from the #KiloKallang journey. While the cookie here is just another sweet cracker which came with a fortune of course, it is its accompaniments that shine the most. The yuzu cheesecake is a beautiful marriage of the fresh citrus notes and the rich creaminess of the mascarpone. The mandarin orange sorbet brings to the palate a clean finish that pairs nicely with the frozen yoghurt ‚Äì its muted tanginess provides a well-rounded mouthfeel. Ok, that\'s all.
A very robust Thai ice tea is melded beautifully with the custard and then served with cr√®me fra√Æche ‚Äì its sour notes strike the perfect balance with the subtly sweet cr√®me. A crown of vanilla sago provides texture and a whole new layer of fragrance to perfume the dessert further...it works especially well with the bitter, almost tannic end of the cr√®me, finishing off a very well-rounded palate.
What a treat to have eaten a few scoops of this. The garlic a√Øoli drizzled all over it added such depth to the flavour profile ‚Äì its pungency softened by the olive oil and lemon juice and the resulting delicate, almost nutty aroma perfumed the rice beautifully. The crispy squid had a light batter that was crispy and perfectly seasoned. Ok, that\'s all.
The amount of sauce glazing them is also key to a delightful eat ‚Äì just enough to coat the meat, with the right smokiness, and not overly sweet. This one here fared quite well. Ok, that\'s all.
How not to love pork jowl that had been gloriously grilled and glazed with a sticky sweet sauce that paired so beautifully with the tom yam-stewed beans with chorizo. So much yaas in this dish. The texture of the beans, accented with the savoury notes of the cured meat, worked extremely well with the kale chips that was light as air. And then there was that poached egg which you just break and mix it all in. Along with the furikake popcorn earlier and a bottle of Cabernet, one could almost channel Olivia Pope while watching a #Scandal marathon. Ok, that\'s all.
The mussels are drenched in Jimbaran sauce (or what NYT called the Balinese thousand spice sauce) which is essentially a m√©lange of beautiful spices ‚Äì think: galangal, turmeric, candlenut, shrimp paste, bird\'s eye chillies, nutmeg, cloves, and kicap manis. Surprisingly though, the heady mix complemented the mussels\' natural sweetness rather than mask it which is a great triumph. My only qualm? Serve more of the sauce on the side...we need to soak that beautifully toasted sourdough! Ok, that\'s all.
While the tongue ‚Äî sliced into thin discs ‚Äî were gorgeously seared with that perfect crisp on the edges, the accompaniment of crunchy iceberg strips, green apple batons, coriander and jalape√±o coins were a little uninspiring. Sure, they did their jobs of providing a fresh burst of clean flavours to balance the richness of the tongue which has a beautifully high concentration of fat, but it needed more ‚Äì pur√©e-ing the green apple together with the coriander might work. But that\'s just me. Ok, that\'s all.
The fruit\'s intense sweetness cuts away the cloyingness of deep-frying. The julienned kaffir lime leaf finishes off cleanly with a much needed citrus boost on the palate. Ok, that\'s all.
Of the eight of us, I believe seven of us experienced torn shell or it could be all of us...the meat/fat ratio was just too perfect, I ate everything up in no time. Nonetheless, the flavour combination was en pointe. The pickled shallot worked extremely well to balance the richness of the meat which had been slow-cooked in a heady mix of spices. The coriander bouquet added a welcome refreshing touch to the mix, as did the squeeze of lime. Ok, that\'s all.
Mind blown. The flavour combination on this bowl is just simply fabulous. You get so much umami from the mix of ground fish + sesame seeds + chopped seaweed, and ‚Äî just like Thelma &amp; Louise ‚Äî the jalape√±o honey (its floral aroma is beautifully spiced with the chilli\'s distinct punch) drizzled all over the popped kernels marry so well with the Japanese seasoning. Cannot. Stop. Nibbling. Ok, that\'s all.
I\'m never a big fan of barbecue sauce but the one that coats this slab of pork ribs is quite superb! However, I thought the meat could surely do with a bit more tenderness. The kimchi apple salad on the side was also abit weird to taste, but it did help to refresh our palates in between. 
Kilo\'s got a revamped menu (sadly with increased prices too) and if I don\'t remember wrongly this Squid Ink Rice is one of their new offerings, and a VERY GOOD one at that! Every component was faultless, from the salmon roe that pops in my mouth to the perfectly cooked grains to the best-I-ever-had deep fried baby squids. Not forgetting the flavorsome garlic aioli of cos, which marries all the ingredients so beautifully together. Highly recommend you give them a good mix before eating, and remember to spritz some lime over for added zest! 
For me, Kilo is the kind of place where food is quite expensive but yet so delicious it\'s pretty much worth every single cent. The one dish I must order EVERY single time I visit, be it at the kallang or orchard outlet, is this Cream of Ebiko Pasta. The smoky chargrilled aroma that wafts from the grilled prawns is simply irresistible and entices my tastebuds even before I start to tuck in. These prawns are so fresh and sweet it had me wondering if they were alive right before the cooking. As you can see, the chef is also very generous with the amount of smelt roe topping, which adds great texture and savouriness to the sweeter cream sauce. Overall, this is one lip-smacking pasta that you should not miss!\n
First time at Kilo! Though this restaurant does not have air con, it was pretty cooling and we sat at the bar-like seats facing the kallang river. We tried a few dishes and I thought this was the best dish of the night! The pasta sauce tasted amazing! On the pricey side but worth a try :) 
Thought it would have been better if the sauce had been more savory than sweet. The mashed potato was faultless though!
This has got to be my favourite pasta thus far. MUST order!
I like eating this best by rolling the beef strips around the asparagus. You will love the ooze from every bite!
One of the best mint sashimi I\'ve ever had, and trust me, I\'ve had A LOT! Heaven in my mouth...
With mushroom cream and tomatoes. Perfect ambience, delicious food and warm service. For those looking for the off-beat but still refined dining experience.
An interesting lighting experience - from natural evening sunset to night light powered by its table lamps and hanging fans on bamboo poles. Rustic, chill and cooling, all this without air-conditioning.

all i know is, as complex as the name of this dessert sounds, so was the entire plate of tastes and textures all mixed into one and it was sooooo delightful! \n<br />to be honest, give me anything sweet or sour and i\'d be a happy bunny. when i get everything rolled into one single dish, i\'m super happy! the creme br√ªl√©e, the chocolate, the meringue, the orange cake (was it?) and slices of orange peel, the.. i don\'t even know what everything was but when seated on a sea of passionfruit sauce... üòãüòãüòã perfect ending to a perfect night with my \"hubs\" @jialatt (happy belated birthday again!) üì∏ @kilokitchen @theuniform
perfectly seasoned and cooked only on the sides, leaving the inside basking in its natural flavour. this was paired with Sweet Corn Cake w/ a dollop of Sour Cream. honestly, the cake was so good on its own, there wasn\'t a need for any condiments or sides to enhance the taste! \n<br />the second main was the Braised Beef Cheeks that reminded me of non-spicy (enough) Beef Rendang. now, is it just me or are there actually similarities between our local dishes and Venezuelan cuisine? ü§î nevertheless, the beef was extremely tender, so easy to eat. i did love the fish a lot more though üôä

The dishes we decided to order was the . It was a dish that consisted of roasted pork, which was fantastically done, where the pork meat slowly melts in your mouth without you chewing too much, tom yum beans, kale chips and chorizo and poached egg. This dish was fantastic, the mixture of the meat, and the sauce of the beans created a rainbow of flavour in your mouth, really enjoyed the unique concept of their dishes, will definitely be back to try their other dishes. Have a great Sunday everyone!

The presence of the bright, radiant salmon roe makes the dish even more delectable
A starter that will truly awaken your palate for the upcoming dishes
Ok, that\'s all.
The fish has such a delicate sweetness that is gorgeously brought out by the soy sauce + sesame oil dip served on the side. Ok, that\'s all.
Fab!
Just the right amount of creamy, sweet seafood taste coating the al dente spaghetti, paired with smokey fresh prawns. I can\'t ask for more. üçùüç§üë∏ #dinner #kilokallang #ebiko #pasta #fusionfood #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #latergram #odetofood #foodreview #spaghetti #cream
