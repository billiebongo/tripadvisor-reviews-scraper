This is typically how most Malaysian restaurants would serve their char siu. Not red at all. Brown char siu sauce caramelised well until the edges are crispy. Super yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />Thanks to @blueskiescottonclouds we were able to have this for dinner. This is typically only served during lunch and must be bought from a stall nearby. Thanks also for arranging dinner for all 10 of us. We ordered 11 dishes for 10 people! How crazy is that?!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_chuankeeseafood #chuankeeseafood #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It was served with a generous helping of fu chuk (beancurd skin). Just perfect to soak up the curry sauce, which was not only spicy but also very fragrant. *\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_chuankeeseafood #chuankeeseafood #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Yes, we were back for the Assam fish head. This is always on point.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#assamfishheadcurry #chuankeeseafood #foodstagram #whati8today #burpple #burpplesg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg #bscc_chinesesg
Well, one of our lunch kakis wanted to try Chuan Kee\'s version and so we did just that. Today\'s soup tasted really good, a lot more depth and more umami. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that we allowed it to simmer a lot longer than my first time here?ðŸ¤”\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#fishheadsoup #fishheadsteamboatsoup #letitsimmer #chuankeeseafood#whati8today #foodstagram #souplover #burpple #burpplesg #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg #bscc_chinesesg
According to our food guru, they are slightly mushy on the inside because it\'s filled with the real thing and not flour. They are really crispy on the outside and I ate them with a chilli sauce which came with our char siu.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#prawnballs #haecho #whati8today #foodstagram #chuankeeseafood #sgfoodie #sgfood #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg #bscc_chinesesg
If they like it, means it made the cut. This char siu did. This is not from Chuan Kee but a few stalls away. Just order a plate to go with the rest of your meal here.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#charsiu #lowerdeltaroad #burpplesg #burpple #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgig #sg #bscc_chinesesg
Chuan Kee\'s prawn paste chicken is the bomb! Crispy and flavourful. Not a hint of oil or greasiness, you almost feel guilt free chomping this.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#harcheonggai #prawnpastechickenwings #chuankeeseafood #zichar #sgfood #sgfoodie #foodstagram #whati8today #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_chinesesg #bscc_zicharsg
Just lightly cooked in superior stock with goji berries and a tiny hint of chilli padi, it\'s really shiok.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#lalainsuperiorsoup #seongtonglala #zichar #sgfoodie #sgfood #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sgfood #sgig #sg #bscc_chinesesg #bscc_zicharsg

Even though we shared a plate of noodles amongst us, we still ordered our plates of rice to mop up all the tangy, spicy and shiok sauce. The fish head was really fresh, cooked just right and full of meat. Really enjoyed this tonight.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#assamfishheadcurry #chuankeeseafood #lowerdeltaroad #localeats #jiaklocal #eatlocal #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple #burpplesg #sg #bscc_zicharsg
That\'s how good Chuan Kee seafood is. It\'s comfort food, perfect for a rainy Friday evening. This time I managed to try out the salted egg sotong and of course, I did my order of Assam fish head curry. Best part is the service here, always with a smile, Jeff and his team.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#saltedeggsotong #chuankeeseafood #zichar #lowerdeltaroad #eatlocal #localeats #jiaklocal #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodie #sg #bscc_zicharsg

We eyed this when it was served. Turns out this was their staff meal and I shameless walked over to take a look and the owners of Chuan Kee seafood gave us a bowl to share. The best Char Koay Teow in Singapore. Full of wok hei, it was like my Penang CKT. Sadly, it\'s not on the menu and can\'t be ordered. Lucky us that we got to sample it.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#staffmeal #notonthemenu #countourblessings #chuankeeseafood #zichar #lowerdeltaroad #burpple #burpplesg #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg
Yes after 10 dishes for just 6 of us, some of us decided to cajole the rest to order the curry fish head in the name of research! This was really good! Ticked off all the boxes for a good curry. Spicy (so for those who can\'t take heat, be warned), just enough coconut milk without having the overpowering taste of santan, it was perfect! Really enjoyed the deep fried beancurd skin that came with it and the taupok too. Needless to say, I ordered an extra helping of rice!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#curryfishhead #chuankeeseafood #zichar #lowerdeltaroad #localeats #jiaklocal #burpple #burpplesg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg

The colour was just too orangey but one mouthful of the sauce, I was proven utterly wrong. This salted egg crab was da ðŸ’£! Grainy in texture and strong in flavour, this is a must order for all salted egg lovers!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#saltedeggcrab #chuankeeseafood #lowerdeltaroad #zichar #dabomb #sgfoodie #sgfood #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg

Whilst this is a very popular dish in most zi chars across the border, it\'s hard to find one here that does it well. Until now, that is. Again, I was very pleasantly surprised how this was so well executed here. They also had petai or stinky beans in it!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#fourheavenlykings #petai #stinkybeans #eatyourveggies #localeats #zichar #jiaklocal #chuankeeseafood #lowerdeltaroad #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg
Before anyone else in our party of 6 could state their choice, I yelled Assam! Well, it turned out to be one of our favourites for the night. Tangy, spicy, with just the right tinge of sweetness, this was an umami explosion. The fish was cooked just right, not overdone. I flooded my plate of rice or as they say \"banjir\" in Malaysia with the gravy. This and a plate of rice would be my happy meal!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#assamfishheadcurry #chuankeeseafood #lowerdeltaroad #zichar #jiaklocal #sgfoodie #sgfood #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_zicharsg
This is only half the spread. Really impressed with the curry fish head dishes here. We were so greedy that we ordered both the Assam fish head curry and the curry fish head curry!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#chuankeeseafood #zichar #lowerdeltaroad #flatlays #localeats #jiaklocal #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sg
