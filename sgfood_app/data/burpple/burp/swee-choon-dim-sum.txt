We were really hungry so we couldnt take nice photos.  The service is fast!! Some of the portions were a bit small though. We ordered most of their signatures like liu sha bao,  mee sua kuah,  egg tart,  xiao long bao,  shrimp fried rice etc.  I really love the xiao long bao here!!  The soup is hot when you sip in, and then with the vinegar and ginger,  it just taste so good!! The liu sha bao is like flowing and flavorful, the skin is maybe a bit thick.  But overall,  nice! The shrimp fried rice makes us more full as it is quite a lot. We shared the price among the 5 of us and was $10.50. No service charge and gst if I\'m not wrong!  😜
All the food is soooo nice especially the liu sha bao! Worth the wait
I went there around 8pm yesterday and there wasn\'t a long queue! I got my table within 5 minutes and food was served quickly too. 
As the title suggests, I truly do not get it. What\'s the fuss with this place? Did I order the wrong things? Did the standards drop drastically or smth? This place is no from me (unless you\'re desperate for dimsum after a night out).
Affordable dim sum! One of my favourite place to enjoy 流沙包！Go with a group of friends together, you can order more choices of dim sum &amp; pay abit lesser. Hahaha. Order more, pay less. ✌️Open from 6pm - 6am ! Closed on Tuesday if I\'m not wrong. (:
Xiao Long Bao (the first dish that arrived). Good food, good company. How I wish every night can be like this...
What\'s your fav thing from Swee Choon?
Clockwise from top left: yam with gingko, banana and prawn fritters, har gao, cold chicken in chilli oil, xiao long bao, liu sha bao. (Approx $14)\n<br />No service charge although gst. Not surprising since they are doing so well. Seeing many tourists wandering into the restaurant compared to the past too. The power of TripAdvisor indeed.\n<br />#sgrestaurant #dimsum #sweechoon #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple
Too bad its cold 🙁. Tastes good but i prefer it hot.
Big big portion w alot of prawns. Tasted like dtf fried rice. Good value.
Soft flavourful yam paste, gingko nut not bitter. Hard to find great yam paste. Phew, this is now my favourite yam paste 😍
Must order! Eat it while its hot. Love the crispy outer and moist soft inner. 
Dim Sum is best in a group. \n<br />Here\'s a guide: \n<br />Custard Lava bun (流沙包）\n<br />Fried Mee Suah Kueh \n<br />Fried Beancurd with chicken floss\n<br />Chee Cheong fun (w any filling) \n<br />Banana and Prawn Fritter. \n<br />Avoid the carrot cake. You are welcome ;) 
🏆CH\'s No. 1 Dimsum Supper Spot, Always🏆
I always come here for the mee sua kueh and carrot cake. 
One of my fav dishes is the pork ribs, and the custard bun.. Perfect place for supper coz its open until 6am!! \n<br />#BurppleCheapNGood
Swee Choon Tim-Sum Restaurant has been serving delicious Hong Kong and Shanghai dim sum to Singaporeans from all walks of life for almost 50 years. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg 
My comfort food, whenever I am here for supper or dinner with family. Fried on the outside, and still so soft on the inside. Laced with some minced meat between the Mee Sua. On the whole it looks oily, but not \"gelat\". It\'s quite plain according to my friend, so some may not enjoy it as much as me. This is for people who love their carbohydrates and would like to go a notch higher. With all that being said, Swee Choon have slowly starting drop their quality standard. Le sigh. 
Swee Choon Big Pau (S$1.80), Char Siew Pau (S$2.00 for 2) and Steamed Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun (S$3.90 for 3). (Date: 16 December 2015 Wednesday) #dimsum #sweechoon #sweechoondimsum
Ordered my usual favourites and alongside awesome company makes for a wonderful dim sum dinner/supper. Still one of my go-to places to curb my dim sum craving, Swee Choon as always is spotted with a large crowd but service is prompt. My must-try is definitely, double-confirm, the Prawn and Banana Fritter which just works for me because it is crispy, sweet and a combination of my two fav ingredients. The custard buns are also one of my must-haves at Swee Choon and make sure to eat it once it reaches your table while it’s hot.
No frills no gimmicks - just plain ol\' tasty Chinese food. It never disappoints. And the custard buns are a must try ! 
Cheap and perfect for late night supper. Love the Chee Chong Fun and Liu Sa Bao. 
Yeah I\'m not a virgin anymore! 😁😁😁 I love the Dumplings in Chilli &amp; Vinegar, Mee Sua Kueh and Liu Sha Bao that stood out the most among all! All thanks to the awesome company who brought me here for supper after a night of hardcore KTV session. Now I\'m officially having sore throat!
Eat so many times already!\" *while eating cautiously, and not finishing any of the longs* and when the food arrived, I was all like \"uh one shot LAH just one shot.\".\n<br />.\n<br />Goes ahead to take 10 shots.
My go-to place when I\'m craving for small bites that pack the strongest, grittiest flavour punch. One must dine at the back alley for full grunge supper immersion.

Creamy runny egg custard filling made with salted egg yolk and butter. #eatwithzac
Surprisingly it was pretty good! Despite all the recent reviews about how quality has dropped etc etc, I thought that the dim sum was really not too bad. The fried mee sua cake was quite unique, and different from your har gao siew mai staples that we are all used to. It was a little too heavy though, as it was literally like fried carrot cake but mee sua instead. The hor fun was one of the better ones. It wasn\'t too salty, and the sauce was really eggy. Their liu sha bao had a nice custard, not too runny or oily. 
Had so many LSBs today, I don\'t think I can eat another one in awhile. 
Food is average with a lil exp for the price . Love the fried rice, taste like dtf. Ice water per cup is $0.30 and non refillable. 0,0
At approximately 10:30pm on a Saturday, there were 19 people ahead of me in the 1-2 person queue. My fellow makan fiends consider Swee Choon a utilitarian joint -- open late for those with insanely high metabolic rates and need full meal at midnight (otherwise known as my dear housemates). Thanks to Burpple though, I managed to craft an order that hit the spot for my late dinner. The fried mee sua cake is well-executed: crispy outside and familiar inside. The chicken in spicy bean paste sauce was sweeter than I\'ve had it at other places but the chicken pieces were surprisingly firm and succulent. Prawn paste wrapped in bean curd and swimming in oyster sauce was average, but consider that it\'s almost impossible to go wrong with that combo. The wantons in oriental sauce were horrible though -- the skin was soggy and the meat tasted \"dead\". I complained to the friend on whose suggestion I was there that night, to which he very apologetically and empathetically agreed that under no circumstances are wantons to be ordered there. Too late 😤
This was so bad. It feels warm and fluffy but really when you eat it becomes mushy and clumpy. Tastes like what you can get from local supermarkets frozen section. You will need a cup of hot tea after eating this. All that glitter is not gold.
Open daily from 6pm-6am except Tuesday. This is the spot for dim sum supper. The dishes to order here are the red bean fried pancakes, Mee suah kueh, har gao, siew mai and xiao long bao. Other stuff like their noodles and porridge are really meh. 
Not a fan of the liu sha bao here. Tried something new today though, mee sua kuay. Crispy meesua on carrot cake if I\'m not wrong so yep pretty interesting.
Apparently I have been missing out on this signature dish, the Swee Choon Mee Suah Kueh! \n<br />Oh my god, this is soooooo yummy this is going to be one of the must-order dish whenever I come to Swee Choon now! The Kueh was extremely crispy (deep-fried with Mee Sua) on top and inside had the softer mee suah that is not fried! So addictive on many levels lol 😋😋😋\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Supper is settled! Besides the usual Dim Sum this place also offers dishes like Ma Po Tofu, Mee Sua Kueh and Drunken Chicken in Shaoxing Wine
No where to go? Try Swee Choon! Good and affordable dim sum. Highly recommend the red bean pancake AND LIU SHA BAO! 
Famous for their liu sa bao, one bite and its salted eggs filings all came rushing out! Eat while it\'s hot! 
Don\'t judge me 😁. Yessss! My custard bun is flowing, so much better compared to the one at 126! The rest were pretty delicious also, overall it is worth it for supper mainly because of its affordable price, but I strongly believe there are other places out there in Singapore that has better quality dim sum out there 😄.
the only item worth coming back for nowadays. \n<br />the liu sha bao is so watery, the mee sua kueh is so oily, the beancurd prawn roll came cold.
Haven\'t been here in ages and the standard of the food has gone down, down, down the drain. Especially the guo tie and liu sha bao. Sad much.
4 munchies: The crispy mee sua (salted wheat flour noodles) is texturally delicious when paired with the moist and soft carrot cake and steamed mee sua on the inside! I\'d consider it the star dish of Swee Choon.
one of my favorite snacks around - mee sua kueh. golden brown outside, a tad moist inside. their quality is not always there, you just gotta pray hard when you order.
3 munchies: While the custard tasted a little too sweet to my liking, what really disappointed me was the lack of strong salted egg yolk savour with sweet and salty textures.
craving wasn\'t satisfied.
NEVER PICK A REFLECTIVE TABLE NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE LIGHTING IS.
Featuring my hand model because I cannot tear my bun nicely 😥
One of my usual supper place with pretty decent dimsum. Not fab but not too bad.
Think dim sum, and definitely Singaporeans will think of Swee Choon at some point of time! Love it that we can enjoy dim sum for supper too.
All the best to your exchange XD @takeitsoon pls learn korean well and teach me 😂
I\'ve been here many times but never had the patience to wait for all the items to be served to take a photo before digging in. But this time round, as we ordered 4 fried items, it arrived all at once, perfect for a photo!! 😁😁 Anyway, this place is slightly pricey but perfect for a dimsum fix in the wee hours of the morning. 
This is what we do at 2am in the morning😂 Ps: we ordered more than this.
Friend gathering hangout place. Mee sua kueh, Liu sha bao, Xiao long bao, Chilli oil dumpling + the standard dim sum stuff ($10 full to $20 buffet full)
DISAPPOINTING x2. Back after a negative first experience as there aren\'t many choices at night. Picked different dishes to give it another chance but the outcome cannot be escaped. Century porridge so bad and clumpy and century egg-less. Mango pomelo was yellowish thin water with bitter pieces of pomelo. Fried prawn dumpling would have been nice if it wasn\'t ice cold. Shrimp fried rice was passable but really nothing you can\'t whip up at home. I\'m not sure why reviews are saying its cheap (nope, very average pricing) and good. Maybe the night hunger is biasing the tastebuds. Twice bitten, there\'s no way we\'re coming back even if the Liu Sha Bao is its only saving grace.
Satisfying is the only word to describe it!! Love the lava effect of it!
Table-filled with goodness! 
satisfying my months long craving. and for de sake of a good take, I had to sacrifice some of my salted egg 😂😂😂
The ever popular place for supper: Swee Choon Dim Sum Restaurant. While Swee Choon may not boast of top quality dim sum dishes, being able to have decent quality dim sum in the wee hours of the morning certainly does have it\'s draw. Recommended dishes: Prawn and banana fritter (special tip: try it with vinegar), Mee Sua Kueh (deep fried vermicelli cake), Liu Sha Bao (Steamed Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun), Fried Custard Pumpkin, Hot and Sour Soup. Well there are definitely way more dishes to order such as Har Gow, Siew Mai, Shanghai Wanton Noodles etc but listing them all down here would just make this post way too long. Just know that despite their extensive menu, it\'s pretty safe to order any dish from Swee Choon as their dishes have proven to be of average standard at least. Coupled with the fact that your stomach is growling at 2am in the morning, Swee Choon might just hit the spot for you. Beware the snaking queues for this place though.
Thanks ah everyone so accommodating, wait for me to nibble through my food hahahah 🐰 #dimsum #supper #yay
One of my favourite place to visit when I need a dim sum fix :) I must say they have one of the best and cheap liu sha bao in singapore
4 trays of liu sha bao and xiao long bao with tons of Siew Mai, har gao and everything else is the best therapy to the hungry stomach haha. This was what 7 of my friends ate including me. Hungry souls haha!
Crispy fish skin and juicy prawn dumplings from Swee Choon. Good place for ol\' fashioned dates and dim sum.
Nice and the yellow gravy just oozes out...but be prepared to q even for weekday but they do have backyard seats as well.
Just order anything since it\'s so pocket friendly (compared to other dim sum place) TRY THEIR MEE SOON KUEH
BBQ pork bun, Ribs and xiao long bao is good but can be pretty pricey 
Not as good as it was, or is it just me huh?
Finally had a chance to eat the yummy dim sum here that everyone was raving about. Being singaporean all me and friends wanted to take a photo of the food, so by the time we ate some were a lil cold. But it was good that our food didn\'t take long despite the quite packed dinner crowd. I\'m glad I had a fair of almost everything. Loved the Xiao Long Bao, the Har Gao, Carrot Cake and the Liu Sha Bao (which is salted egg yoke custard bun, just that I didn\'t expect it to be slightly sweet). It\'s value for money if you\'re a big eater and you\'re going with friends. So you can share and eat more variety. 
Watch us break this apart x 3 times!
mee sua kueh.. @elllsatan which one do u miss de most?
red bean pabcake. I guess this has been the longest time I havent been here. woohoo
Salted Egg Custard oozing out of the bun. The bun is too thick...it\'s too bun-ny. #foodcoma #SFFgetsCornywhenSleepy
When we ordered Fried Custard Pumpkin, we didn\'t quite expect this. Took a bite and Oooooozzze. Dim sum is always amazing. #instavideo
Char siew pau! Latest food review on Swee Choon dim sum is up at sethlui.com
Supper at Swee Choon! @bertzaong @yongsart @ronlwq @billheng #supper #nothingleft #nofilter
Sweet and thick with varying flavours!
Liu sha Bao. Or egg custard bun for my non-Chinese friends. From one of the most well-known dim sum, Swee Choon.
Now Swee Choon also have this. Haven\'t had this for some time since Chicago
 Sweet char siew filling in the so layered baked pastry
Let it flow... let it flow... let it flow... Go to Swee Choon how can dun order their famous Salted Egg Custard Bun!
The fried mee sua thingie is the most unique for me. Great for supping.
An extremely popular, chilled out dinner and supper spot, swee choon is great for meeting old friends for a noisy, casual meal. The food is good, with a large variety to order from, but this means you have to queue. 
and the star of the show, #custard #bun. one of the food not to be missed. taste great but more of this makes you fat fat. haha. representing @burnandforget to nom this delicacy!
Hot custard just explodes in your mouth when the sweet pumpkin tears open. Perfect sweet treat.
Definitely one of the best ones I had in Singapore. 
I went there on weekend and welcome by crowded queue outside but succesfully get in to eat for only 30mins waiting time. I love the custard bun, its addictive.
This was the reason why we find ourselves next to mustafa on a Thursday night! \"Fried Mee sua\" fans, this is a must try. Here is a classic example how texture to your food makes so much of a difference in each bite! Disclaimer, it wasn\'t as wow as it was described to me. Cause I\'d choose carrot cake anytime over this. But that\'s just my preference =) #burpple
Awesome dim sum restaurant. Must try their custard bun, portugese egg tart, and many others!
Another view of our massive feast the other day. Who ever said girls couldn\'t eat? ;)
i only visit swee choon for small bites/supper. the standard for this might have dropped :(

Pot stickers which unfortunately didn\'t taste as good as they look. I do think that this is one of those dishes that are hard to perfect.. Anywhere to suggest for some good guo tie? :)
Amazing fried beancurd prawn rolls. Yes I know I\'ve Instagrammed this to death(haha)...all I can say is that I\'m a creature of habit. Get ready for a visual feast! #sgfood
Banana and prawn fritters - interesting but forgettable combination. Yawnnn. #dimsum #dinner #closeup
Beancurd prawn and pork rolls. Never fail to order this whenever I\'m here. FULL OF JUICY GOODNESS #closeup #nofilter
Don\'t be messin\' with ma chee cheong fun. #dimsum #dinner
Fried tofu topped with pork floss. This was so good. And did I mention that the tofu was silky smooth? #dimsum #tofu
Fried pumpkin with custard. Haha sinful to the MAX. Deep fried pumpkin balls are already sinful enough and they even stuff the salted egg yolk custard in it. But why does fattening stuff always taste sooo good?:(
XLBs are too mainstream. Cos they\'re really good haha. Skin a little on the thicker side though
Favorite dish tonight - beancurd prawn rolls. Drooling just thinking about this.... 😳😍
Fried pork ribs with salt and pepper. Tender, crispy, juicy goodness. Highly recommended! 👍👍
Guo tie(pot stickers) which were AMAZING. There was soup that squirted out when we bit into it! 😝
Sichuan chili oil wontons - these were slightly spicy and sour and pretty nice. Only good while hot! Personally I prefer Din Tai Fung\'s version of this dish. Still worth a try though!
Refreshing mango pomelo sago(楊枝甘露) for dessert! Had to satisfy my craving after looking at @carissa_ho\'s picture! 😜
One of the dishes we always order whenever we\'re here - char siew buns! 😃 It was delicious, but I was still slightly disappointed because it seemed to have less filling today! 👉👈
Impromptu late-night dim sum with dad at Swee Choon. Meet the carrot cake! 💛
Fried red bean pancake — this was one that really hit it for me! Fried to crispy, golden-brown perfection and filled with a load of red bean paste.. Neither too sweet, nor too oily. LOVE! Verdict: Must try!😍
Xiao long bao(steamed soup dumplings) 😃 Not the best, nor my favorite dish from Swee Choon, but still decent in my honest opinion. Value for money and good for sharing! Do try!
Dad\'s favorite - braised chicken feet🐔 Very tender and flavorful! I like this one too 😊😃
Currently at Swee Choon for dinner. As usual, the char siew bun did not disappoint! Fluffy white bun filled with generous servings of tasty and piping hot char siew😍😍

Rarely tries out the other dishes on their menu. So this time round I was with 3 other girlfriends (the one who always order everything that looks nice, the one who eats and says very nice.. very full 😂 and my girlfriend who has, picky taste). We had a very filling late lunch so we decided to skip dinner and head down to Swee Choon for dinner/supper. As usual, Saturday evening crowd is expected, lucky us that we didn’t have to wait for too long to get a table 😀 But the amount of food we ordered, overfilled the rectangular table we were given. 🤣😂 $121+ for 1&amp;1/3 full long list of orders 🤣😋 #burpplesg #burpple #burpplefood #singaporedimsum #dimsumplace #sweechoondimsum #singaporefoodie #supperfood #singaporefood #drunkenchicken #cheecheongfun #prawndumpling #liushabao #eggtarts #xiaolongbao #feedmefood2017

another interesting item in the lunch menu.. but somehow, the whole thing dosent taste right.. the banana is those \'raja\' type which is sweet but the prawn is nowhere to be found.. instead it taste more like pork instead of prawn.. oh, the fried batter is more to the salty side..\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#dimsum#sweechoon#sweechoondimsum#siewmai#charsiewbao#jalanbesar#timsum#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
something out of the ordinary I suppose.. Tofu is fried pretty well with smooth beancurd underneath. Taste is pretty straight forward with typical savoury Tofu and slightly sweet floss..Skin could be more crisp but good attempt nonetheless..\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#dimsum#sweechoon#sweechoondimsum#siewmai#charsiewbao#jalanbesar#timsum#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
well, at least they are quite experimental as they added some of the non traditional dim sum which taste decent and refreshing!

As expected, it\'s always long queue whenever I am there. #sweechoon #dimsum #liushabao #burpple #burpplesg
Creamy, buttery, salted and sweet custard filled buns steamed to order.  One word of advise, consume while Its hot.  Like the Italian saying, \" Pasta waits for no one!\" In this im case, it\'s, \"The Salted Egg Buns jumps the queue on the priority list and waits for no one.\" Eat up!! Since I have foodie friends in town, it\'s a must to have multiple meals to try all the places on the list so eat we go... Swee Choon Restaurant, Jalan Besar, Singapore
One of the most famous dimsum places in Singapore, I was rather disappointed : ( maybe the good reviews and hype got me too excited and raised my expectations a little too high but there\'s really nothing extraordinary about the food here. I have to admit the liushabao is great but that\'s really it :   (

So good!!

first time trying their tofu dish and it\'s a hit! crispy on the outside and so silky soft inside.
Fried wontons from here for the first time - tasty, juicy and best when piping hot. Yum!!
Xiao long bao anyone? 😉
Crispy golden mee sua kueh! @jitterhaps your favorite! 😁
Drunken chicken anyone? Get ready for a visual feast! 🐔
Hot, sexy, steamy xiao long baos😉 Not the best I\'ve had, but still pretty good in my humble opinion...
I am so glad the juicy, meaty, piping hot char siew pau is back! Yum! 💛
