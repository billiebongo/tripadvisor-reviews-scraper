Grab a coffee and enjoy the new week.\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />Have you tried the Miso Pumpkin Salad and Chilled Soba at One Man Coffee (Fusionopolis 2) yet?\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />#OneManCoffee #Coffee
My favorite combination is a double shot with beans from @axilcoffeeroasters with half the amount of sugar. A great refreshing drink to kill the heat from these hazy days. \n<br />#onemancoffee #burpple
Not your everyday salad but it\'s really good! The Yuzu dressing complements the miso pumpkin so well, it\'s easy to finish the entire bowl (no kidding!). The sandwiches at this new store are pretty good too! Can\'t wait to try them all üòã
The Short Review
Those who work in the One-north vicinity have welcomed this much-loved cafe with jubilation, now having one more awesome spot to pick up a (very) decent cuppa and irresistible bites. The Breakfast Burger ($6) with scrambled eggs and bacon jam (!) truly does make for the perfect breakfast, along with a double shot Flat White ($5.50) with a choice of beans from Axil or Nylon Coffee Roasters. Great for a light lunch bite its the Truffle Ham &amp; Cheese Croissant ($7) ‚Äî gorgeous chunks of brie sitting just-melted over a thick slice of honey ham, and just a slight hit of truffle mascarpone enough to make you forget you\'re having a bad day. Seats are limited to 4 at a round table, with narrow standing tables running along the sides. This is more of a takeaway spot, or a quick lunch with a colleague.
I am usually not a fan of cold sandwiches that is pre-packed, left in the display chiller and only to be reheated when you order them, but this was not anything like that. In fact, you could taste freshness out of this one; the light, fluffy toasted bun with juicy and tangy sundried tomatoes, scrambled eggs well-seasoned with salt and pepper and One Man\'s signature bacon jam which now comes spread so generously on the bottom bun, this is a hearty and comforting dish without being heavy for the morning. Priced at $6, this is indeed a more affordable option amongst the pricey establishments for the office workers in the area
Anyhoo, a great cuppa at #onemancoffee with nylon four chairs blend, double shot flat white - really smooth and that instant caffine kick!
Always on the lookout for great ham and cheese croissants, of which the top two before trying this was common man\'s and delifrance\'s. Yup, for just $7 this baby has now topped the charts. A lovely warm croissant with just-melted Brie and a slab of ham is perfumed with heady truffle aroma. Totally perfect with their great coffees for a light lunch or a heavy breakfast! The space is small here, so don\'t expect to get a seat. 
Yes my fave Bacon Jam from OMC, with scrambled eggs and grilled tomatoes. So much bacon goodness in every bite‚Ä¶
- with Brie and TRUFFLE mascarpone, this truffle ham and cheese croissant ($7) would make you say \"cheese\" üòÅ  
üòÇ Making a mess everywhere I roam.
The menu here has an entire different menu from its other outlets. \n<br />Pictured here is the Vietnamese Pork Belly Ciabatta ($8) - Oven Warmed before served gives the bread a fluffy text which went well with the roasted pork belly, pickled vegetables and a slight spiciness with its unique shiracha mayonnaise! (They made it something similar to a Banh mi but used a softer fluffy ciabatta instead)
Yes that super happy person is me. #Owly was having a blast too.
What a pretty space! But unfortunately for all of us though, this outlet of One Man Coffee do not serve our all time favorite French toast and gashouse eggs! Instead we will be expecting new items on their menu, like sandwiches and more takeaway options!

So glad that One Man Coffee finally opened their new outlet at Kinesis @ Fusionopolis 2; went for a double shot for my Flat White and I love how well-balanced it is being creamy, smooth with a nutty and earthy body with a clean finish.
Super happy one of my favourite cafes is opening near work. More incentive to work from the office with good coffee.üòÇüôä And super chuffed to be their first customer even before they open. üòÅ Look out for this spotty feature wall outside the cafe. *happy dance* .

‚ò∫Ô∏è Yes, we know that positivity is key... But instead of harboring happy thoughts all the time, you\'ve got to get a move on in achieving things that you deem impossible instead of always witnessing others make changes to their lives. || ~ with the year coming to an end soon, lets reflect... What have you done different this year to improve yourself? ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />#randommusings #coffeetalk #onemancoffee #cafehoppingsg #sgcafefood #burpple #sipandgulp

What happened to the French toast and gashouse eggs from @onemancoffee?\n<br />.\n<br />The newest space at Fusionopolis (one-north) does not serve our all-time favorites but, I think they got me head over heels with their fresh offerings here with this bowl of soba noodles, which was, wait for it... SOBA GOOD.\n<br />.\n<br />A simple bowl like this was packed with flavors, with the sesame sauce and Sakura ebi giving it some heat and the smooooooth cold soba noodles. I can have this EVERYDAY. REALLY. LIKE LUNCH AND DINNER ALSO EAT THIS.
Chilled Soba with sesame dressing, charred corn, Sakura ebi! #onemancoffee #fusionopolis2 #chilledsoba #flatwhite #espresso #coffee #axilcoffeeroasters #sgfood #burpple #mondays #japanese
