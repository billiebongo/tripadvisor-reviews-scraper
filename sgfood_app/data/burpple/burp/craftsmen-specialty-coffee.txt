Drizzled with yummy salted palm sugar, sprinkled with berries, crowned with a sea salt ice cream.
Thick yet fluffy soft brioche bread, coated in gooey mozzarella, topped with crunchy pea sprouts, sun dried tomatoes, and tender Morrocan spice marinated chicken.
The bacon slices were a little too salty. The espresso ice cubes were quite the creative one. 
3.5/5 Dish is alright, nothing too spectacular. Healthy I guess. Could make it at home for 1/3 the price paid here tho. The pulled pork sourdough that we ordered (didn\'t take a photo) was tastier! 
Good food is always worth traveling for and such was the case with Craftsmen Specialty Coffee. Tucked in a quiet corner of the Siglap neighbourhood, Craftsmen delivers a delightful selection of coffee and all-day breakfast in their cosy cafe. (For my full review, check out mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg) 
Think churros rolled in cinnamon sugar and drizzled with chocolate, served in a cup of vanilla ice cream. Perfect pairing with some coffee, be it hot or cold.
Coffee is leaning towards the citrusy side which makes it a light beverage that\'s suitable especially during weathers that make you just wanna hide in a cafe where the air con is on full blast mode.
Still one of Monster\'s favorite eggs Ben variation. \n<br />Much cheese. Such yolk. So wow!
I think I\'m awake now!!! Pretty decent coffee, just that I prefer mine with nutty tones. 
My type of waffle. Scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and a nice tomato salsa. You get the best of both worlds here. Just need to remind myself to order another portion of smoked salmon. #waffles #brunch #sunday #sundayfunday #sundaybrunch #salmon #craftsmenspecialitycoffee
Eggs cooked to perfection. Soft and fluffy. The guac was smooth and full of flavor. And what I love about this dish is that it\'s stuffed with really fresh ingredients. I just felt the hollandaise sauce was abit over-powering. @craftsmenspecialtycoffee #craftsmenspecialitycoffee #croissant #eggs #scrambledeggs #brunch
This is a place I drive by everyday. Either on the way to work or on the way home. What always attracts me is the soft lighting and the wood furniture. It gives me a very calm and soft feeling. So decided to finally give it a try. 
I\'ll look back at this first photo and be reminded not only about the food but also the friends I\'ve made along the way. \n<br />Thanks guys for an awesome 2015! Here\'s to the journey ahead!\n<br />Cheers! \n<br />#instasgsunday10pm #instaSGsundayBestOf2015
In desperate need of this intense iced espresso latte 😴
It\'s all about the craftsmanship! Their brunch menu is life changing
I took a bicycle to there , very nice here . And I feel very famous this shop 
The pie shell encasing the piping hot filling was crusty at the edges, base and sides not too thick nor doughy. When sliced open, out oozed the stringy cheese and tender chunks of beef. Well seasoned, and probably an entire pie (and a cuppa) would suffice for lunch. 
It started to feel like there was enough dough action here to feed an entire PCF Kindergarten class but thankfully the curry-ish chipotle mayo, so indecently addictive that it was probably enchanted with a dozen infatuation spells by top level wizards with wands made of Thestral tail hair, proved feisty enough to prevent tedium from ever setting in. 3.7/5
(must be some penang post syndrome 😢) This ice cube espresso would definitely be good now,  given the horrible hot weather and it\'s form keeps it strong! 🙋
The waffle was sweet and soft like a bunny’s cottontail butt, whilst the grilled streaky bacon had both the salty, crispy edges of bacon and a hammy body so you essentially get a boinking load of oink for your buck. However, the element that would warrant a repeat visit is their curry-esque Craftsmen sauce, which has a mildly devilish kick and leaves a teasing numbness on le lips. They should set up a spinoff meat joint and just slather this magical potion over steak, chicken chop, cod fish, unicorn flesh etc – ker ching. 4.1/5
Waffles going surprisingly well in savoury topping yet bringing out the slight sweetness from the buttermilk waffles. Their homemade tomato salsa were on the sour side helps makes the whole thing less gelat (that\'s if you are eating it all by yourself😆). The game changer will definitely be the homemade \"hollandaise\" sauce of chipolate &amp; Mayo, bringing some spiciness to the equation and making wanna hog the whole plate to yourself regardless. \n<br />This was a hosted meal by @craftsmenspecialtycoffee, thank you for the warm hospitality &amp; thanks @larvitar for inviting me along 😊
monday huh. so what\'s for breakfast? how about a gorgeous poached egg perched atop on scoops of salsa, avocado and toasted english muffin. lovveee how the salsa brings up the zest in the muted taste of poached eggs and avocado! \n
light slipped in albeit coffee sipped. imperfections is what make them beautiful. is tuesday, remember to have your coffee!
Essentially a crispy and fluffy and chewy waffle, drizzled gloriously with maple syrup and slabbed with simple butter skimming its buttery glory on the almost perfect waffle, this reminded me of the first time i ate waffles a decade ago, and why i fell heads over heels in love with this simple dessert in the first place.
The slightly sweet waffle was heaped with bacon, scrambled eggs, salsa and an amazing spicy creamy sauce. I\'d return for this for sure.\n<br />#veronicaphuaeats #craftsmenspecialtycafe #craftsmencafe #craftsmensg #brunch #waffle #sgfood #sgeats #eatoutsg #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #cafesg #sgcafe #whati8today #8DaysEat #openricesg #hungrygowhere #waffles #burpple #burppletastemaker
This was only my second savory waffle ever after my first at Stateland Cafe from a long time back, and it\'s really delicious in its own style.\n<br />As expected, the waffle was light and fluffy but what was unexpected (in a good way) was the unique spicy, creamy sauce on the scrambled eggs. Now THAT really added oomph to the whole dish. I was told it\'s powered by a mix of spices. From what I could taste, I think there\'s some kaffir lime leaves in it too. Another smart move was the addition of salsa. It enlivened the rich, heavier flavours with a sparkling note. I do wish the bacon was slightly more crisped though.
I\'m pleased as punch to find that Tapping Tapir Natural Sodas have arrived in Singapore! Here\'s my Burpple post about the brand from when I first tried it in KL about a year ago... 
Nice space, decent coffee, amazeballs 7-spiced chai latte, better-than-average brunch fare - Craftsmen\'s one of the places I\'d fall back to when I want a no-brainer brunch. The food\'s not the most consistent and they do have their bad days, but it\'s decent and good enough.
So glad I live in a neighbourhood where there are many delicious cafes, and craftsmen is one of them! \n<br />Situated very conveniently opposite Siglap centre, this is def a place to go for a coffee break! The coffee was on the strong side and I really liked it! They have a wide variety of cakes, pastries and waffles too! I\'ll say the portion is pretty generous and the ambience is definitely great to chill and talk with your friends ☺️
these were good but somewhat lacking in texture.
Yummy! The waffles were spot on - soft and fluffy yet crispy on the outside. Definitely worth coming back for more :)
1st it was waffles ..now it is yoghurt 🍧🍶especially with fruits 🍌🍎🍒🍓. Plain yoghurt parfait with 🍓🍓🍓 &amp; granola. healthy snacking😋so bright, appetising &amp; yummy #yoghurt #detox #snacks #burpple #openricesg #foodstagram @craftsmenspecialtycoffee @khaslee @yuenzz86
So I convinced the guys to try the tantalizing muffin with poached egg; which would also provide a great egg porn moment for photos. \n<br />It arrived looking great. Lightly toasted muffin, heaps of guacamole and chopped tomatoes, topped with a poached egg. My only gripe and a very important one was that the egg was cooked through and through. Leaving us fairly disappointed. \n<br />But golden rivers of yolk aside, it still tasted amazing. Great texture and flavor all around. Creamy, crunchy and crisp \n<br />Monster will be back to try it again. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Craftsmen offers a few variants for the waffles and this was one of them. Waffles were crisp but short on fluffiness; seemed a tad stiff inside as it\'s a bit hard to cut, though we really love the wafting buttermilk scent within. Salted Gula Melaka was pretty flavourful without being overly jelak, and the nuts seemed to go pretty well with the waffle and sauce surprisingly. Thought the strawberry pieces seemed a tad unnecessary as it seemed to have added a strange berry flavour that did not really combine itself into the waffle.
no real beer tonight because it\'s @kellyskittletoes big day tomorrow.
Top it off with creamy scrambled eggs and what else? More cheese!! This is Monster Level Brunch! \n<br />Enjoyed the simple pleasures of ham, eggs and cheese. I should do this more often :) #hungryhungrymonster
Perfectly round poached eggs. It\'s cooked perfectly for that flowing egg porn moment. \n<br />Then there\'s some guacamole and chopped tomato to top off the English muffin. It\'s sweet, it\'s rich and eggy. \n<br />Its a simple fare that makes me feel warm and fuzzy. \n<br />Monster cannot resist a good brunch. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
$8 carrot cake. Can be comparable to cedele\'s. But a little small. 
Probably the last post for these two weeks before the start of mugging for exams 😢. Anyway, the flat white here was bitter 😒, but luckily the sea salt gula melaka ice cream with waffles made up for it. \n<br />Waffles were pretty fluffy and crispy, topped up with the random nuts around it, which made it actually very filling upon finishing the whole thing. \n<br />The ice cream were also less fattening, which suits the flavor for this because personally I think it will suck if it contain loads of fat in it. 😄\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Here\'s Craftsmen Specialty coffee which does decent good and carry superb cakes. Review on www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio! On a side note, all cafes should have white walls and natural light (this is what happens when you don\'t).
Coffee is amaze balls (Dutch colony, not to acidic, smooth finish) but service leaves much to be desired. Delivered my food order to someone else and when the customer tried to tell the staff so, the staff member brushed her off. Ended up having to retrieve my food from the customer. Thumbs down. 
Cheesecake is a little too soft...probably melting... but still very creamy and made me want to take one bite after another...
Back to our favorite joint, and the food is still fabulous!
And also the mocha 😱 damn awesome can!

Poach eggs were done perfectly with super appetising sauce. Coffee was great, perfect for Saturdays
Perfect for a weekend chill. This place serves cold brew too, unfortunately it was sold out too quickly.
Freshly made waffle topped with Salted Caramel Ice-cream, dressed with sliced fresh strawberries, drizzled in Gula Melaka and chopped almond. A burst of sourness, sweetness, saltiness and crisp with each mouthful! The waffle is so huge, it\'s a meal itself! At S$13.90 a portion. Try it without lunch or dinner :)
Crispy waffles that comes with a generous helping of strawberries and crushed almonds.
Just like how the name suggests. It was still refreshing to have after countless bites unlike most cakes. Really sinful to have as well but definitely worth it :-)
a really nice place, pictured here is their flourless chocolate cake! the cream isn\'t the soft sort and isn\'t too sweet either. we had their flat white and chai latte as well
The Craftsmen Supreme is on the pricier side at $19 but absolutely tasty especially if you love breakfast dishes! The eggs are yummy and the coffee is really good and solid and the waffles are to die for, it\'s a good place to come in the evening for dessert too. Also has friendly staff, free wi-fi, power sockets and a wonderful ambience for an afternoon with friends or to do your work. :-) 
$14. Satisfying brunch of perfectly poached egg, generous thick slab of tasty grilled ham, melted cheddar&amp;emmental cheese, fragrant bread. The portion was quite filling for me probably because of the 3 layers of bread. Sadly, I can\'t get my churros fix here cos I\'m too full, might come back for it!
Pretty good place to chill, and not too crowded so I can probably spend my afternoon here to get some work done
Small and cosy shop. Limited seating meant that it might be super packed during their peak hours. So if you want to enjoy your coffee without feeling bad about hogging, I would suggest going on a weekday afternoon. They are currently having promotion where you get a cuppacino or latte and any small pastry for $5.90. That\'s really quite the steal. And did I meantion that they offer free wifi? 
But i didn\'t really enjoy it. Lack the fluffiness that I will appreciate in a waffle
It\'s just a pretty face but the taste is a little disappointing. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
I have a special fondness for all things buttery and butter croissant is at the top of my list. When I saw the butter croissant at the pastry counter, I immediately knew that is what I am going to get. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
The combination of the sweet churros and creamy cold ice-cream is a delight. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
When you step into this cafe, you can\'t help noticing the industrial looking decor and its colourful hipster looking ornaments. The toast I had was ordinary, nothing out of the box. On retrospect, I would have ordered a hot beverage instead of my iced hazelnut latte. Overall, I like the ambience and the fact that it\'s so damn close to home! Would head back to try their desserts though! Saw some goodlookin\' waffles and churros around ;)
Yummay! P.S. Don\'t try your luck w the parking wardens , they are super \"on\" in the siglap area. Underground parking is available in the building or opposite at siglap centre. 
Using beans from Brazil, their Cold Brew was robust and earthy, but also came with a mild fruity flavour.
Coffee wasn\'t too acidic yet strong. Not too creamy yet rich. Will definitely return
#craftsmenspecialtycoffee. Industrial-looking interior similar to Jimmy Monkey. Very friendly staff who pops around for a chit chat and makes recommendations. It says 33degC on my weather app but it really feels like 40degC.. Which explains why the Hub &amp; I are sharing a cooling #Cider at 3pm in the afternoon. 😝 And in that black glass is @csy41031\'s #coldbrew. #roscafehops #coffee
Amazing coffee with that lovely almond fragrant. For $6, though it was pricey but it is really worth it, except that the location is a little hard to find but still find a time and visit it! 
Our post-dinner coffee place. Great for conversations!
Beans are from Dutch colony. Pastries are supplied from BAO again. Pretty decent coffee. Too much cafe sprouting out with the coffee supplied from pretty common roasters as well as the pastries. So IMHO, to stand out, your interior and service has to be really good. Otherwise the hype won\'t last. (I\'m talking about cafes with just coffee and pastries of course) 
Another hippie cafe at Siglap. I love my estate 💜
Situated at Siglap V, this new hip cafe / store features crafted cakes and coffees. Not very good for groups unless u\'r willing to wait but ideal if u wan quality cakes and coffees
Young (good-looking) staffs and young crowds. Jayvier loves the Chocolate Salted Caramel and the Cafe Latte was enjoyable too.
Love this new cafe in siglap! Gets quite bustling though, but lovely when it quiets down.  As they have a small (&amp; open) kitchen, they warned me that this dish would take 30min but I came faster than expected. The milky thyme poached eggs was delightfully unexpected. Was lovely with the salmon &amp; avocado on toast was 
If you are the one who can\'t miss out on hipster cafes, Craftsmen would be the place of your choice to chill especially with its industrial theme. If the orange cups look similar, that\'s because they are affiliated to Dutch Colony Coffee from Pasarbella. Not really a fan of their rather light-bodied coffee but it definitely has the potential of being an uprising cafe. 
Pitchstop: hope this latte and salmon quiche can boost my brain with some omega 3 for tomorrow\'s paper!
Appearance isn\'t everything but when it comes to cakes and desserts, I am guilty of falling for the pretty ones. Like the Rose Chocolate Cake I spotted today. This big slice of chocolatey red velvet was covered in bright pink cream cheese frosting in the form of luxuriant roses. Sigh... how to say no to it?
With a name like Craftsmen Specialty Coffees, there is pressure to deliver. Which they did without question in the good hands of Rashid from Dutch Colony Coffee Co. Using a blend of beans also from Dutch Colony that\'s \"crafted to perfection to suit the community\'s palate\", both the latte and cappucino we had were impressive. For you coffee connoisseurs, this is the profile of the coffee: \"balanced, sweet toned with hints of ripe lemon, finishing off with a dark chocolate ending\".
In order to thank patrons for their patience in waiting for them to iron out licensing issues that forced temporary closure over the past few weeks, Craftsmen served up free coffee. Offer stands today as well. Pretty nice, especially since the staff was very friendly and the chocolate was non-syrupy.
Citrus-y with a sweet chocolatey ending. Using blends from Dutch Colony Coffee.
Feeling lazy! A new cafe, partnership with Dutch Colony, so coffee is as good as Dutch Colony\'s. Super friendly service just like old friends, and very crowded too. [Mocha S$5] [Flat White S$4.50]

Had a dinner here with a latte, smoked salmon croissant, salted egg york fries and the timeless sweet waffle as dessert. Their salted egg york fries is very addictive! Their sweet waffle is so so - I would be expecting something more crispy but this texture is more like a sponge cake.

This cafe definitely has it breakfast meal spot on! Really couldn\'t find any fault with this! The crossiant is rich with butter and probably toasted with the right texture and the eggs are expertly done with the addition of cheese which just compliments the whole combo!

Had the kimchi flatbread ($16) which came with grilled back bacon, pork bratwurst and sunny side up eggs all smothered in a flavourful, mildly spicy house-made sriracha sauce (kinda like a spicy hollandaise?) and topped off with pomegranate seeds and pea sprouts. Felt that the kimchi was a tad too salty, along with the bacon + sausage so thank goodness for the eggs and pomegranate which provided a nice sweetness to balance out the dish (a more generous sprinkling of those seeds would\'ve been perf). 
So I traipsed #inmybackyard looking for something sweet. Stumbled across this version of affogato.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />A whole bar of magnum choco almond floating in a cup of espresso with kahlua. The espresso was dark and mellow and mixed with kahlua, the taste was even more intense. If that was not enough, the rim of  the cup was dusted with espresso powder, making it even more bitter. The ice cream melted alittle in the espresso but did not really sweeten it. Anyone who loves espresso will enjoy slurping this. As for me it was a little too strong, the expression on my face😨 after first sip but it was a solid perk me up before traipsing home.
The portion was still very hearty with lots of scrambled eggs, ham and mashed avo!

😍🍻😍🍻 || but first, some sweet treats to celebrate the weekend starting with this {Churros} from @craftsmenspecialtycoffee ~ I would describe it as somewhat of a Kueh like texture, almost springy and with caramelized innards. \'Canele\' springs to mind after a few bites. Although the presentation may seem very impressive at first sight, the ice cream unfortunately does not benefit the non-crispy predicament。\n<br />～～～\n<br />Set your sights instead on the new sourdough offerings. The pulled pork and that dynamite sauce is really something something。
pronto. Especially after beating the dirt tracks for the last 3hours. And maybe this {Smashed avocado, feta cheese, fresh sprouts and pomegranate on multigrain sourdough} from @craftsmenspecialitycoffee to take away the raging headache that I\'m suffering now。

・・・Popcorn match latte sounds good. Tough choice over my favorite mocha. 😜\n<br />Other than coffee, we have drinks like Iced French Mint Chocolate &amp; Popcorn Matcha Latte that goes really well with our cakes! 😄😜 See you for tea break! 😁🍰🍵☕ #craftsmenspecialtycoffee #craftsmencoffee #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafefood #eatoutsg #brunchsg #missionsgcafe #burpple #mintchocolate #popcornmatcha #sgbakers #cakelovers #redvelvet #strawberryshortcake #instacafe #igsg #singapore #easties #siglap #eastwood #sg50

Awesome experience!
Deli!!!
Yummy!
What an amazing presentation! And it\'s delicious!
The crepe layers were too thick to be even remotely enjoyable. CWO$.
Churros with Vanilla ice-cream. Served at S$10+ a portion. It was good and fluffy. 
Love the bitter choc chalk
Located at Siglap V, the cafe is definitely more accessible, and hence the crowd. Coffee\'s quite good - there\'s a good balance between the espresso &amp; milk. A pity it doesn\'t offer hand-brews though. #singaporecafes #cafehopsg #coffee #cafe #coffeeplace #coffeegeek #coffeelover #cafejunkie #instacoffee #coffeeaddict #coffeeholic #coffeelove #ilovecoffee #latte #latteart #burpple
Here to satisfy some churro craving since Spanish doughnuts at OC has closed😕$10, not the best Churros around. Not as crispy as I\'d like but it\'s not too bad. The vanilla ice cream was a good touch.:
Amazing coffee....my top list for coffee nw
Foam was a lil cold, but coffee was not too bad. Good balance of acidity with a tinge of bitter note.

Crisp on the outside and soft in the inside, these cinnamon sugar sticks had the right texture but were slightly weak on its sweetness as they could be more generous on the sweet coating. The Earl Grey Lavender ice-cream was aromatic, but would have preferred that they use Vanilla as the flavours would be less clashing somehow.
Waffle was good, and the ice cream was delish. 
Fake bacon bits. Egg was so-so. Croissant w chicken n mango chutney was good though. They don\'t do cooking here, all prepared beforehand. Guess they\'ve quite a few suppliers. #craftsmenspecialtycoffee #siglapv #singapore #coffee #sgcafe #cafehopping #cafe #lunch really dislike a bacon thingy if I ever come here again I must rmmbr to ask them to remove e bacon from a bottle
