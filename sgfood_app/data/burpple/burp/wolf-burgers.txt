[Wolf x Bird bird @annsianghill]\n<br />Patty packed with flavour and you could tell it\'s the real deal. Just look at that slab. 
Strip Porker - slow cooked cola pulled pork burger ($9.9). Could not really taste cola.. nevertheless the tender pulled pork and nicely toasted burger buns made up for it. \n<br />Dark chocolate milkshake ($6) was rather sweet and tasted more like chocolate malt milkshake instead. Did not taste bad but was not a taste which we were expecting..
Treated hubby a nice mushroom burgers as per recommendation by some Burplles. The truffle smells so good and the beef patty also another daebak!
As far as Swiss/emmental cheese and mushroom burgers go, Wolf Burger seems to have nailed it. Gooey cheese and juicy patties are what makes a good burger, and the Magic Shrooms ($10.90) has done it\'s job.
With its success of the shroom burger, one can\'t go wrong with The Alpha. I mean double patties stuffed into a brioche bun for $15.90? No complaints from me!
Long gone are the days where BK\'s mushroom swiss reigned supreme, and I\'m so glad that Wolf Burgers decided to do a gourmet version of it. The aromatic smell of truffles hit you as you take each bite into this oh so juicy and tasty burger... totally made me want to order another as soon as I finished my last bite.
First time trying this burger and it has a quite decent amount of mushrooms and the medium well beef patty was pretty good. The down side about this burger was that it was not smoking hot. The burger was quite affordable but I do not recommend ordering extra bacon because it was too dry. Overall a good experience. However, it can be further improved.

The brioche buns are perfect. Is perfect a strong word to express my contentment of dem buns? I ordered the Wolf Burger and wolfed down the burger in no time. I would have preferred the seasoning on the beef patty to be heavier but heck, this is one AWESOME PAWSOME burger! I will be back to try the Shrooms burgers and create more puns.
Having eaten at Wolf Burger and am head over heels in love with their juicy patties that make for a good, relatively cheap and definitely satisfying burger, and sinful kimchi cheese fries, I was excited when I found out they now deliver through @ubereats_sg!
Magic Shroomz 🍄🍄 ($10.90)\n<br />Sweet Potato Fries ($5)
The Magic Mushroom was sufficiently magical to my tastebuds. A respectably sized, high quality beef patty is cooked to a perfect medium doneness. I prefer to have my burgers cooked for longer as compared my steaks, and Wolf Burger does it just right. 
THIS is a damn burger!! Double chuck, dripping with juicy goodness, and a smooth, bronzed, glossy buttery bun. It may not look like much, but is intensely satisfying and filling.
Think juicy medium rare beef patty blanketed with a slice of sharp cheddar &amp; a scoop of caramelised onions sandwiched between two toasted buns just for $9.90! Totally a steal for a satisfying burger at such a cheap price in town!
At just $9.90, The Wolf burger sees one juicy beef patty blanketed with a slice of sharp cheddar and a scoop of caramelised onions. But why settle for one patty when you can have two? We\'re going for The Alpha ($14.90) — double the meat, double the cheese and double the satisfaction. It’s juicy without being overly drippy, and doesn’t even require fries, though an order of S\'mores Fries ($8) probably wouldn’t hurt either. It\'s best to share it all with a friend if you want to avoid a food coma. \n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Zhihui Lim
Hadn\'t had Wolf Burger for quite a while and also realized I have never actually tried their beef patty before so decided to go with the Magic Shrooms. Overall it\'s a satisfying burger that\'s quite good at $10.90 with the beef patty coming in your preference of doneness — opted for medium-rare while it came with truffled mushrooms, caramalised onions and melted Swiss cheese. The medium-rare beef patty came with a pinkish-centre; relatively juicy and went pretty well with the caramalised onions and the stringy Swiss cheese that is melted over the patty. The buns are decent; buttered and grilled, but I\'d I had one thing to pick about this it would have been the truffled mushrooms — well-sautéed that added an earthy touch to the burger but lacked the truffle aroma that it seemed to have promised by being a little faint.
Truffle fries ($8)
Wolf Burgers offers gourmet burgers, traditional and unconventional fries, waffles and milkshakes. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg 
Think s\'mores and you think dessert. But trust the people at Wolf Burgers to combine that with sweet potato fries to create S\'mores Fries ($8), a savoury-sweet side to enjoy together with your burger. The winning combination of lightly torched, pillowy soft marshmallows sitting atop a glorious pile of equally crisp and well-seasoned sweet potato frites, sprinkled with cereal bits, is slightly delirious but oh so wonderful! For a satisfying lunch, pair the fries with the Pork Gochujang Burger ($9.90), a pork patty char-grilled to-order, topped with Korean-inspired grilled cucumber and kimchi — it helps to balance out the spice. Food coma guaranteed.\n<br />Photo by Burppler Gavin Chan

Wolf burgers. We love gourmet burgers! \n<br />Must try when you\'re at Parsabella!
The classic cheeseburger - caramelised onions, lettuce, and melted cheese atop a beef patty. Was pretty good, except for the overly salty patties.
2nd visit to Wolf Burgers, since we loved it so much we had to go for The Alpha ($14.90). 2x juicy medium rare beef patties, cheese, caramelised onions and lettuce slap onto 2 toasted buns for 2x the satisfaction! Math done right 😊👍🏻\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $40\n<br />————————————————————————
The pork belly was pretty succulent albeit being too chewy at the fatty area for my liking &amp; wished they used normal kimchi instead of chopping/blending it into a pasty consistency.A little pricey for a burger consisting of just kimchi and pork belly though. Had to add $ for this egg. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
And K pork superstar (behind,$9.90), consist of fatty and juicy pork belly and my Favourite kimchi. Not really a fan of burger, and these doesn\'t make me love them in anyway -M
So far every burger from Wolf Burger that we had had been pretty tasty, without a doubt K-Pork Superstar ($9.90) as well! Bringing forth a Korean fusion with gochujang and kimchi cucumbers, along with 24 hours marinated and braised pork belly!! I love their sauce so much that I didn\'t leave a single drop behind. 😋\n<br />————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $40
The fragrant butter fills the air. Yumz!\n<br />Featuring Beef Burger ($9.90) 🍔 and Chocolate Milkshake ($6).
Finally made it back to @wolfburgersg after a month to try their new burger. Packed with truffled sautéed mushrooms and the sweetest, darkest caramelized onions, this is the most amazing rendition of a mushroom/cheese burger you would devour. I added a fried egg because, everything is better with a fried egg. The fluffy, buttery brioche and the mostest awesomely \'secret blend\' beef patty (cooked medium for optimum pleasure) comes standard. My only regret was that I had to share this burger as we decided to order food from different stalls to have a feast and the sentiment was shared among the group. I NEED to go back for a full burger real soon. \n<br />If you are heading to @wolfburgersg for some grub, download @holler.out and quote ‘jonathanwong’ to get 10% off your meal when you spend $40 (or more). To put things in perspective, that\'s a couple of burgers, fries and their freaking awesome milkshakes - because good things should be enjoyed in groups.

Frankly, anything with S\'mores automatically qualifies it as a dessert in my book. But I have never had melted marshmallows with sweet potato fries till yesterday, and boy, were they a treat! If I\'m not mistaken, there\'s also honey drizzled over and crunchy honeycomb pieces (or are those cereal bits?) as topping. You would think this would be a sugar overload but oddly enough, I couldn\'t stop myself from gobbling up the whole serving. Maybe it\'s because I was balancing that sweetness with the hefty Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger that came smothered in salted egg mayo. 😆😆 
I had been on a hunt for something to indulge in and this big, bold thing of beauty totally nailed it for me.\n<br />Clearly, at Wolf Burgers, wimpy patties need not apply. Between those buns was an actual piece of boneless chicken meat that\'d been coated in a spicy batter and fried to a respectable crunch. It rested comfortably on a bed of refreshing housemade coleslaw that wasn\'t too tangy or sour, and was blanketed in salted egg mayo. Every bite brought all the elements together in a most satisfying way.
Tried the chicken burger as the 2 other dishes I\'ve ordered are beef based. The serving is huge. I think one should always do burgers the only way it should be done. Beef patties. 
K pork Superstar ($9.90). Decent sized burgers at superb prices. We opted for this interesting twist on a burger and were rewarded with juicy, fatty slabs of pork belly, seasoned with mkimchi and gochujang. Daebak! 🌟🌟🌟🌟
I could taste every aspect of the Basic Wolf Burger($9.90)! The juicy medium rare beef patty, sauteed onions, pickles, tomato and the slightly burnt toasted buns, what a beautiful combination! ☺️ I could totally go for 5 of this! 😋
I personally prefer their Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger ($9.90) with the extra crunchiness from the chicken complemented with salted egg mayo, its a different kind of heaven 😋
At just $9.90, the gourmet burgers here are quite delish. This one is topped with salted egg yolk sauce. But go for the signature Wolf with their signature sauce. Preferred it over this. 😍
Wolf\'s signature burger comprises of juicy minced beef patty topped with melted American cheese and sauteed onions. The soft toasted bun boasts an attractively glossy burnish , which I always like, and is generously lathered with butter. Top up $3(for real?) to add a nicely fried sunny side up egg.
The patties were moist, perfectly medium rare, and just lightly seasoned - good cause the melted cheddar provided so much additional flavours. Simple fare of double moo patties, double (did someone say double?!) cheese, caramelised onions and lettuce, held together between shockingly fluffy buns. So good.
Wolf Burgers has the pork burger with a korean twist. A thick and juicy pork patty with appetizing kimchi and cucumbers, and spiced up with gochujang (fermented spicy Korean sauce). I like the idea of the burger but the taste was lacklustre. 
Buttermilk fried chicken burger from @wolfburgersg with salted egg mayonnaise and slaw, and a fried egg to top it off. Awesome post shoot meal. \n<br />#burpple #wolfburgersg
Kimchi cheese fries so good it makes your brain stop and wonder where in the world you\'re at. Beautiful mix of Korean and American style
Super uniquely fantastic burger with salted egg mayo, fried chicken and caramelized onions. Note that the sunny side up was an added ingredient to satisfy my craving x
Skipped dinner, now I\'m dreaming of last night\'s sinful crispy, buttermilk fried chicken that miraculously retained its juiciness. Between two fluffy buns, and glorious salted egg mayo (ok la only gripe was salted egg wasn\'t strong but worked great altogether anyway) making this a pretty messy meal down to the last lick. But hey, the best kind of mess. $9.90
Paired with their rich Dark Chocolate Malt Milkshake, Wolf Burgers\' gourmet burgers are value-for-money and rather well-executed. Between two soft, buttered pan-fried buns is a crispy fillet of buttermilk fried chicken cushioned on tangy purple handmade slaw and drenched in a rich egg mayo sauce. The fried chicken was not too dry and though the taste of salted egg can’t be easily detected in the mayo sauce, the flavours all go surprisingly good together.
Love love love the bun they used. One of the important things that most burger joints overlook. The whole combo was beautiful. What an affordable burger too. Psst.. This is so much better than the hyped up Butcher Club Burger franchise. My personal opinion.
The default doneness is medium rare, so I ordered a medium. It was in fact a medium well burger. Not sure what meat they used in their patty, but it just tasted off to me. Cheap burger, but not enough to make me come back.
Juicy and tender double beef medium rare patties with caramelized onions and melted cheese in between two fluffy buns. Yet another favourite burger add to my list! So worth it. Oh and the kimchi fries taste really delicious too, definitely worth coming! 😁\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
You wouldn\'t think that fries, kimchi, nacho cheese &amp; mayo would go that well together, but they sure did. The textures &amp; flavors that this dish had made it easy for me to wolf it down, especially since I love potatoes &amp; anything spicy 😊 \n<br />#aroundwithamd #burpple #woldburgersg
Skip the fries and go for the burger! This is the Wolf Burger made of beef patty with cheese, sautéed onions, pickles and tomatoes. The juicy patty is the star of the show here, and that made me happily wolfed it down! 
Juicy double beef patties with cheese ($14.90) omnomnom....
The Alpha leads the pack with two medium rare patties, properly melted cheese and buns that have been FRIED. At $14.90, there is nothing better! 🍔🍔🍔 #burgerporn #burgergram #instafood #sgfood #burpple
Wolfed down this delish glorious mess pretty quick. The Alpha ($14.90) with juicy double beef patties, melted cheese, caramelised onions sandwiched by light fluffy buns that were rather crisp on the sides. (And I\'m not saying this because it was Charlie Lim\'s bandmate and I\'m a fangirl- it\'s legit good imo) + service recovery was great. They had apparently missed our order so we waited for quite long but they apologetically offered this freakin\' awesome sinfully good kimchi cheese fries (think crazy gooey cheese, sour cream and kimchi that wasn\'t too overpowering). 
So sinful, you want to drink it again. Be warned, you might take an MC the next day because it\'s so good. \n<br />#wolfburgersg #burpple
...with a sunny side up egg and bacon bits! Available at Wolf Burger from 3-6 pm. The chicken is hiding behind the egg (that\'s showcasing it\'s yolk porn 🙌🏻)
The vibe there cannot be more different from the laid-back farmers\' market feel that you get from #TheGrandstand flagship, especially with the loud, thumping music, graffiti art and neon signs.
From the folks behind Carvers &amp; Co, Wolf Burgers is situated within the just-launched PasarBella at Suntec City, which sees a food court-like concept where diners order from different “stalls.\" Following the popularity of their beef burgers at Carvers &amp; Co, Wolf\'s menu also includes pork and chicken varieties, alongside three types of waffles. Go for the Pork Gochujang burger ($9.90) — a pork patty char-grilled to-order, topped with Korean-inspired grilled cucumber and kimchi. For something classic and satisfying, the Alpha Burger ($14.90) will do the trick with two thick, chunky beef patties coated in a double-layer of melted American Cheese and caramelised onions. Add a side of crispy, well-seasoned Sweet Potato Fries ($5) to complete the meal. This seems like a good spot for after-work dinner, especially for groups who can\'t decide where to eat!
By the same people from Carvers &amp; Co, Wolf Burgers is one of the new stalls opening within Pasarbella @ Suntec City. Pretty much a Korean inspired flavour, the buns were light and fluffy while filled with a pork patty, cucumber, kimchi, cheese and Gochujang sauce in between. Pork Patty was grilled upon order, smoky and juicy while the bun was light and fluffy. The grilled cucumbers add a little juicy and refreshing crunch along with the tangy kimchi with really mild spiciness. Admittedly it would be better if they were able to put more Gochujang in especially given that it\'s the selling point of the dish; could barely get enough of that flavour within. Sweet potato fries was a decent add on; crisp, well-seasoned with salt, yet soft and sweet inside. Would be back to try their Fried Chicken Waffles, other burgers as well as the other stalls.
Double premium beef patties, double cheese!! $14.90 worth it.
I mean strip porker. Cola glazed pulled pork burger with gorgeous melted cheese and jalapeños. \n<br />Bun is well grilled with butter, pulled pork is a bit sweeter than savoury due to the cola I guess. It\'s quite a generous serving if you\'re a smaller eater. Really wished for the price we get fries by default instead. \n<br />#vscocam #vscofood #instafood #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #sgfood #wolfburgers #pasarbella #pasarbellasuntec #burger #stripporker #pulledpork #suntec #sunteccity #igsg #sgig #burpple #singapore #latergram

Enjoyed the classic Wolf Burger ($9.90) - a juicy, nicely seasoned (could cut down on the salt by just a teeny weeny bit) beef patty cooked medium with the usual suspects: melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle and smokey caramelised onions. One of the most affordable good quality burgers in the market, and even though I\'m in no way a burger fanatic I would definitely come back here!!!
#ButtermilkFriedChickenBurger for SGD 9.90, with #saltedegg #mayo and #homemadeslaw. The #pink #slaw really #madethedifference, with a #sweetsour #addictive #crunchiness. #Toobad the other burgers aren\'t very #good. #lunch #Burrple #chicken
It adds a layer of delish around the fried chicken fillet which is already tender and succulent by itself. The homemade slaw consisting of primarily purple cabbage is slightly tart and balances the distinct flavor of the salted egg yolk sauce. \n<br />#instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood  #burpplesg #instasg #igsg #sgig #foodpics #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #singaporeinsiders #exploresingapore #foodhunter #food #foodporn #igfoodies #foodgram #foodiesg #foodie\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfoodies #foodphotography #foodstagram #burgers #burpple #friedchicken #igfood #saltedeggyolk #foodsg #burger
A Medium Rare Beef Patty with Sautéed Truffled Mushroom &amp; Sweet Caramelised Onions Topped with Swiss Cheese Oh Yes.. 🧀 (S$10.90) .\n<br />The Brioche Buns were Buttery, Moist &amp; Fluffy. The Beef Patty though was a tad under seasoned, the Truffled Mushroom could be more generous &amp; Fragrant too. But it was Juicy, God the Juices from the Beef made the Buns a little too Soggy that\'s the drawback. 🍔 .\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Get the Alpha Burger (S$14.90) instead, you get 2 Thick Beef Patties with Caramelised Onions &amp; American Cheese.
