So easy to the pocket with a price tag of $49++. 9 dishes with familar tastes to us but being done with a beautiful twist. \n<br />Mommy said dont play with ur food, I said it is not a bad idea to think out of the box. Snack culture has proven that fusion food can be yummy and fun. I was looking forward to every next dish till the 9 course dinner ended with this chendol panna cotta. Silky smooth panna with rich lovely gula melaka. What a perfect combi to end the night. I dined feeling super happy. On a side note, as per requested, I did the #ontheladder shot for this pic. #敢敢做个开心人
The Cajun Seafood en Papillote ~ super fresh prawns and clams baked in parchment paper. Enjoy the natural juices of the seafood, the Cajun, spices and garlic 😋 so very yummy!
The food here is so so good n the company is simply awesome!!!!
Oh my... I am so blown away by the powerful fusion of taste, textures, ingredients choices and asian fusion menu.
So brilliantly paired together. Who would tot that chilled bkt could be sooooooooooooooo good! #敢敢做个开心人

{Chilled Black Fungus and Mushroom Salad in Nonya Belachan Mayo dressing} @thesnackculturecompany. // inspired by traditional nonya chap chye, this dish carries most of the usual suspects, however not stewed down to meltingly soft, but presented in an array of textures and colors, made exemplary with that addictive spicy mayo dressing. Almost like having a party in your mouth!😍 #burpple #foodporn #modsin #thesnackculturecompany #CThub #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #iphoneonly #whati8today #hungrygowhere #ssfoodtrail #omakase #degustation #SGfoodies #igsg #chapchye #soPeranakan
This one takes it home with its deceptively smooth and creamy innards underneath that glossy sheen of Gula Melaka syrup. To die for! Now it\'s off to bed in a #foodcoma state.

Currently having a 1 for 1 gourmet coffee or Italian gelato! Gelato texture was good, smooth and creamy. Tried the tiramisu, quite pedestrian with a strong coffee taste, nothing to rave about, though there are bits of walnuts in it. The rum and raisin was weird, couldn\'t taste any rum or raisin. Tasted like weird caramel, maybe I was served the wrong flavour. $4.90 per scoop!
