Their crispy thin toast with homemade kaya is legit golden.
Sunday morning head down for Breakfast. Find a seat and order at the counter. There is no pricing indicated on the menu, hence we just pay after ordering according to the lady waitress (pressing calculator). They served the wrong drinks and accused us for ordering wrong. They insist we ordered wrong cause we pay $1.50, which is kopi ice. How do we know iced Tea cost less than that? Refusal to change the drinks and force it down since we already paid. Delayed 2 out of 5 breads that I had ordered. 
Ordered the French toast set ($6.20). It comes with the French toast, 2 soft-boiled eggs and choice of drink. Not cheap but mega yummilicious! The kaya accompanying the French toast was so good that I could lick the plate. üòÇ Caution expect a 15-minutes wait for the preparation for the toast. The coffee is thick, aromatic and not overly acidic. Love it! Will come back again for the coffee and kaya! Xoxo, wet tissue no have
It has always been roti prata or economic bee hoon. üòÅ I think because to my parents, eggs not cooked = inedible. üòÇ We may be able to easily recreate this at home, but not that nostalgic feeling that it gives. ‚ò∫ #ÁúüÁöÑËÄÅ‰∫Ü
Stumbled upon this place while out running errands - Super crisp toast with homemade kaya, and perhaps the most fabulous teh I\'ve had thus far üòç. Really fresh eggs too! ($4.10 for the set)
Assam Garoupa  (market price)
Fragrant Chicken ($12)
This was delicious!!! The fish slices were fresh and tender and wok taste (ÈîÖÊ∞î) was present. The vegetables were crisp and crunchy. 
This is one of their signature dishes. Could smell the coffee fragrance even before the plate reached the table. The meat was tender and the coffee sauce coating it was strong and it wasn\'t salty.
Hands down! It has that distinct bitter taste yet lemak too..\n<br />French toast used to be good.. Now it\'s slightly dry..üòî
Heard from Keong Saik regulars that the standard of the food at this place is similar to koksen! 
Hawker take on French toast but it was really good and eggy, with a slap of melting butter and heaps of homemade kaya. Mmmm... Wish I had ten more scoops of the kaya! It\'s not too sweet, but I do wish it was a little bit more pandan-y. Quintessential Singaporean breakfast of kaya toast, eggs and kopi is a must!! The only downside is they aren\'t as generous with the kaya as some places. 
If you haven\'t already tried Tong Ah, head down now!! My favourite will always be the crispy one- thin but not too thin bread, sweet but not too sweet kaya, buttery but not too buttery butter (lol). 
Good quality food at a very affordable pricing. Eg. This table of food only costed us less than $50 (including the beer). One of the must try will be their Assam fish head. The sourly Assam infused into the fish head. Good balance of sourness and spiciness leaving us wanting more. \n<br />For the full course ‚¨áÔ∏è\n<br />http://www.jiaknonstop.com/restaurant/tong-ah-eating-house
Wet or dry, the absolute basis of a good hor fun lies in its wok hei. That necessary smoky lick from a well-seasoned Chinese cast iron wok is irreplaceable and hard to obtain. But good cze char places pay attention to these minute details. Had this plate of satisfying noodles when I was sick last week. San lor hor fun when done right can be super delicious. Most important thing is not let it get bland. The fish slices here were generous and meaty and fresh - another important must-have. I was impressed I came back to buy some home for dinner for my boyfriend. He loved it too!
Perfect start to the day.
We are all living in such a high-paced society that makes us neglect all the simple things in life. From time to time, we should take a well-deserved break, drink some kopi, eat some kaya toast and just watch the day goes by. One such place that I will recommend to go for a traditional Singapore breakfast is the iconic Tong Ah Eating House.\n<br />Till today, they have preserved the art of making good coffee using the sock and stick with the practice of scrapping off burnt bits from their crispy thin toast using the sharp edges of the condensed milk tin can cover, a method which dates back decades ago. No need for fanciful cafe food which will easily set you back more than $20, a set of crispy thin toast or French toast with homemade kaya and butter, soft boiled eggs mixed with dark soya sauce and pepper, and a cup of kopi will get more bang for your buck. As they say old is gold, I truly believe Tong Ah has reached legendary status in my books. #bestfoodmemory2015
The one table that brings everybody together to discuss anything and everything under the sun (or moon). And what better place to enjoy it than at one of Singapore\'s pioneer hawkers, right smack along Keong Siak Road. Did anyone say coffee pork ribs and homemade tofu? Hit me with some of these anytime any day.
Man‚Ä¶ Tong¬†Ah¬†Eating House‚Äôs coffee ribs are good. I dislike coffee with a vengeance but who can resist the fragrance of the sweet coffee glaze?! Instead of having the famous¬†toasts and coffee, I was craving for some good comforting Zhi Char. Best eaten with a steaming bowl of rice; the crispy fried pork ribs were nice and juicy with a good, springy bite to it. Yup, I could have the ribs as my daily coffee fix!
I do not like kaya so I asked them to leave it out. The toast was really crispy and there\'s a great slab of bitter in between. I\'m not sure how this is special, maybe because it\'s lacking kaya. So I don\'t think I\'ll specially be back for toast, but I\'ll get it if I was here in the area! 3.5/5üåü
My fianc√© was not impressed with the French toast. Again, I did not have the kaya but I must agree that the French toast was rather thin and dry. I think I\'m more accustomed to the western fluffy style of French toast. 3.5/5üåü
With a ice cold beer and good food!! So much comfort to the tired soul!
I could smell fish sauce instantly once this came to my table. Spot on!!! After my friend and I were discussing what smell was that and checked with the boss. My nose and my tastebuds are pretty sensitive!!! The flavor is super intensified!!!! Salty, sweetness, sourness all at once! Some love it but I prefer the coffee pork ribs more..
4.5 munchies: One look at the glistening meat and you know it\'s going to be super fragrant and crispy. Who\'d have thought that the coffee pork ribs here at Tong Ah ‚Äì known for its Kaya French Toast and black coffee with a slice of butter ‚Äì are surprisingly good?! The strong coffee aroma could also be detected even before the dish landed on the table. This dish is best served with a bowl of piping hot steamed white rice.
Thanks to dinner with my fellow #BurppleTastemakers, I fortunately discovered that apart from serving the iconic traditional kopi and toast, Tong Ah also serves amazing tze char! The claypot fragrance chicken and coffee pork ribs are delicious! The former was sweet and spicy with good use of dried chilli while the latter was tender with that beautiful glaze and kopi fragrance. Best of it all? It\'s still an underrated hidden tze char gem!
Im pretty disappointed in this one. The teh was so dilute, it could barely taste anything. Worst teh ever..
Nothing beats having the traditional local style big breakfast on a lazy Sunday late morning. üòô
No coffee art, no brioche thick toast and no egg benedict.. Just some good old traditional coffee, soft boiled eggs, thick kaya toast and egg toast. Simply traditional, simply good. Happy Sunday everyone. „äó
And who can resist these plump, eggy French toast served with butter and homemade kaya??? 
A good breakfast means a crispy light fluffy set of toast with a darn good local cuppa. 
How about some Eggs √† la Singapura. #SoftBoiledEggs with #SoySauce and pepper is definitely on my list! Always thought this was pretty typical until my #Vancouver friends complimented this dish. \"Eggs with soysauce. Who woulda thunk? It\'s genius\" Haha I almost forgot that only Asians use soy sauce extensively! @courtgeezy @kourtschu
The much raved about French toast was indeed pretty good. Soft and eggy, it\'s wonderful enjoyed with some of that melted unsalted butter and a dab of chunky homemade kaya. The crispy super thin toast was also enjoyable. Our experience however was soured by the horrible service. We were continuously rushed to make our orders despite the near-empty store; yet when we finally did our orders were taken wrongly. A wrong payment was demanded of which no refunds were granted. Since the food isn\'t all that mindblowingly awesome, I\'d rather stick to convenient and friendly Wang\'s for my kaya toast fix.
If you\'re getting their #toast, definitely get this thin one. Tried the thick one too and didn\'t enjoy it as much. Thin one was crispier and had less bread to kaya ratio, so you get the full kaya-butter taste! And yes I sometimes eat this for dinner. #dontjudge
Ordered their Set of Thin Toast,  comes with 2 rather gigantic eggs (really big yolks) and my bulletproof coffee üòç \n<br />Fellow #burppletastemaker @juliuslim introduced how they retained their traditional way of scraping \"chao ta\" sides of the bread with the condensed milk sharp lid,  creating these perfectly toasted bread with eggy custardy kaya and some sinful butter!
I\'ve burppled this many times. But this is one place I\'ll burpple again and again and again. If you are not a Kaya toast person, fret not for Tong Ah has so much more to offer. The Tze char is amazing and it has gotten my parents coming back week after week. These are MUST-TRY dishes at Tong Ah Eating House: 1) Fragrant Chicken 2) Fragrant Tofu 3) Fried French Beans 4) Coffee Pork Ribs. 
Start your morning right with traditional local breakfast as kaya and toast can never go wrong! Having a cup of my personal fav milo \'gao\' and toast from the nearby coffeeshop has never failed to brighten my mornings hence I was excited to get my hands on some toast from the raved Tong Ah Eating House. The French Toast slathered with butter on top was decent, it was fluffy and had eggy fragrance (if that makes sense) but the highlight was definitely the delectable homemade Kaya at the side. The Kaya at Tong Ah is quite unique, not smooth with bits and chunks but fragrant and not too sweet.
Back in the good ol\' days, my parents would bring my brother and I here whenever we were in the area to have our favourite French Toast. My brother and I would try to gobble up our toasts as fast as we could, in attempt to poke our fork into the last piece of toast, just so we could soak it in all the remaining delectable homemade kaya, and sinfully good butter around the plate. Of course, we\'d be scolded by our parents, \"Why are you eating like you haven\'t eaten in years?! Slow down the both of you\"! The slower one would then whine to mummy, then we\'d bicker between ourselves, and eventually get an even bigger earful from our parents on the ride home.
Expected much more for the front French toast. Distinctive kaya I would say. That set itself costs $6.20 but it was disappointing compared to the steamed set which costs only $4.20. Well, I believe everyone is capable of making them except for the unique kaya spread. 
Definitely time for some soft boiled egg, kaya toast and bulletproof coffee (kopi + butter)(!!!) Any breakfast/brunch plans for the weekend?
4 munchies: Start your week right with one of the combo sets that comes with two large runny soft-boiled eggs ‚Äì my picks are the kopi-o with a slice of butter and French toast. I\'ll definitely return for this as well as to try the zi char dishes. Thank you, @juliuslim, for the awesome recommendation!
[Keong Siak] Throwback to a couple of weeks ago where we had our first hawkerhopping x hawkerpedia food trail. The first stop is to the iconic Tong Ah Eating House whereby we enjoyed a traditional breakfast of eggs and toast.  Huge eggs that were half-boiled, cracked and mixed with dark soya sauce and pepper. Bread that was toasted slightly and sandwiched with homemade kaya and butter. To round it all off, a cup of iced coffee that is sieved through a sock to finish off the excellent morning. This is definitely the type breakfast for champions.
[Keong Siak] We are all living in such a high-paced society that makes us neglect all the simple things in life. From time to time, we should take a well deserved break, sip some kopi, have some toast and just watch the world goes by. One such place that I will recommend is the iconic Tong Ah Eating House that serves some pretty darn good quintessential coffee and toast, or you can call it the Chinese \"brunch\" to make it sound cooler. The art of making coffee though the sock and scrapping off the burnt bits from the toast using the sharp edges of a milk can top dates back to many years and this practice is still being applied today at Tong Ah. No need for any eggs benedict, waffles or pancakes, you just need to order a set of crispy thin toast kaya or fresh toast with kaya, soft boiled eggs and a cup of kopi. After which, sit by the roadside table and appreciate the simple things that mean something. #hawkerpedia
[Keong Siak] Amidst all the hustling and bustling,  we tend to overlook the simpler things in life. Why not take a break from the rat race of chasing new cafes that serves different eggs benedict dishes, artisanal coffee or funky toasts and appreciate the original, authentic Singaporean breakfast/brunch of kopi-png, kaya toast and soft boiled eggs? One place that does that impeccably has definitely got to be Tong Ah Eating House, which has been feeding people since many years ago. I look forward to my next trip to Tong Ah and I will most probably be still ordering the same items again.
Just next door to Taratata, this quaint coffee shop was formerly located at the present Potato Head Folk. Living up to the hype, the french toast was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, with a generous amount of butter slathered on top. The kaya reminded me of the one my mom makes at home :) The teh c was thick and full of flavour, the way I like it. Will be back for more. I heard they have zichar at night too.
The toast was really warm and super crispy thin! It was like those of Ya Kun\'s, but somehow I prefer these ones, probably because of the traditional setting we were in, and also the spread of butter and kaya seemed more generous. A lovely breakfast to wake up to during a relaxing staycation!
Sometimes all you need is a good cup of kopi and kaya toast to satisfy the Singaporean in you, and that\'s when you head to Tong Ah. They\'ve been serving butter kopi even before adding butter to coffee became a thing. Make sure you don\'t miss the super crispy kaya toast (tip: request for your toast to be crispy), and also their soft, irresistible pile of French toast. The kaya here is chunkier than what you\'re used to, but it adds that rustic feel and is still as good. For the quintessential local breakfast, add a couple of soft-boiled eggs. You\'ll have a breakfast of champions ‚Äî and at a fraction of what you pay for at caf√©s!

With a cup of kopi and soft boiled eggs, this is perfect at any time of the day! The toast was crispy on the outside yet soft when it meets the slab of home-made kaya and melting butter. Yums!!
And have been looking for them Argentinian prawns since.Was just so tickled to be able to find them unexpectedly in a Zhi Zhar place last nite at dinner. The herbal broth was super sweet at end after we were done enjoying the sweet¬†, lobster like texture. So goodbye,crayfish! Tata, lobster ! We\'re breaking up ! üòã‚ú®üòÇ
We are lacking of those traditional Kaya-toast these days but I\'m really grateful for the older generation who built this traditional food culture in Singapore. Because everywhere just seems to be new-aged just like our playground these days. Don\'t you agree?
This is the best all day breakfast. Nothing pretentious, just comfort food that everyone can relate to, and nothing can ever go wrong with this.
Simple honest kaya toast for breakfast is üòçüòçüòç
Sometimes all you need is a good cup of kopi and kaya toast to satisfy the Singaporean in you, and that\'s when you head to Tong Ah.

Must try. Value for money for 6 huge pieces for 14bucks!!! Great for groups who want to have a gathering and food together.
Starting to think that Tong Ah\'s Tze char is comparable to Kok Sen. Today we ordered Fragrant Chicken, Sambal Kang Kong, Special Tofu, Sweet and Sour Pork and Prawn Omelette. The first three dishes were delish as usual, with my favourite being the tofu. Prawn omelette had a beautiful wok hei. Sweet and sour pork was just.... So so. Still, it was quite a great meal. 
That crisp and fragrant kaya. 
Severe weekend withdrawal after the cny. This cup of coffee definitely managed to chase some Monday blues away. 
Tong Ah is known for their traditional local breakfast and an aromatic cuppa local kopi. Personally, I love their Teh too. But I guess you can\'t have too much of a good thing. Their yuan yang fell below my expectation. No sweet aroma of neither the Teh or Kopi, even though you can taste the individual components distinctively. Guess I\'ll just go back to ordering my Teh in future. 
The super \'gao\' Kopi, topped with butter. Guilty much, but hey! We all deserve these little indulgences right? Priced at $1+/cup
Ask for crispy toast and that\'s what you\'ll get. Very crispy and yummy. 
‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è 6 eggs down and I\'m still hungry. üò™ I think I need meat and more fats for every meal. Hopefully the kopi O kosong tid-lor can keep me going till later!Have a great Sunday everyone!!
It\'s so thin that I was eating two slices without realizing. Good kaya with cold butter and warm toast - what more can a foodie ask for in a good local breakfast. 
Doesnt get better than this.
Tong Ah\'s toast is thrice-toasted, with charred parts scrapped off by the lid of a condensed milk can (very skilful), sliced into two (very thin) and sandwiched with iconic kaya and salted butter. Very old school! \n<br />More at http://danielfooddiary.com/2014/07/08/localcafes
As much as these look good, NO they are NOT! The only reason we ended up here because Kok Sen (resting for CNY until 25/02) *insert ultimate sadfaces* First, the food is not that fantastic at all. Second, their services horrendously fucked up. I\'ll have a full dateup later, because im, rather all of us are extremely upset w the whole experience here. üò†
My family has no fate with Burnt Ends. This is our second attempt to try the place and it\'s closed! The first time they were so packed the next seating was at 9pm. So mum suggested that we try this tze char place within the same area which is apparently famous. We had their signature deep fried chicken (which isn\'t exactly the same translation from Chinese). It was similar to ‰∏âÊùØÈ∏° but spicier and sweeter.
Sinful Cholesterol loaded drink colleague had. They said it\'s good. Omg.
Despite the new location, still as good. Only less the nostalgia of a traditional kopitiam setting.
It used to be better. But still quite good lah
A close up of possibly the best Kaya Butter Toasts around! The toast was still fluffy and had retained its moisture even though it had been toasted and the layer of kaya was just right, not too thick nor thin coupled with the butter that has melted under the warmth of the toast, ahhhh!
The best Kaya Butter Toast i have had in a while! And not forgetting the Kopi too, the fragrance of the coffee still lingers even after it slithers down your throat :)
Highly recommended by the auntie. Sliced bread with kaya &amp; butter, because its thinly sliced, it taste great with the bread. My favourite among all the toast. \n<br />Normal toast: well it\'s normal.\n<br />Steamed toast: not very well steamed, therefore it\'s not totally soft.\n<br />French toast: not too bad, if only there\'s more butter. üòã
True bliss is when you sip a good cup of Kopi Peng Siew Dai (Ice Coffee Less Sweet) on a hot sunny day.\n<br />.
Êù±‰∫öcoffeeshop ÁöÑÊó©È§ê. French toast Ê≥ïÂºèÂêêÂè∏. Each piece of toast is coated generously with egg. Topped with sliced butter and best eaten with kaya on the side üíñ.
French Toasts with Kaya (Coconut Jam). Some of my favorite comfort foods to start the day. Happy Weekend peeps! :)
Second coffee fix at Tong Ah Coffeeshop @jolenekcw recommended. Good old kop!i üòâ @yangdenver I decided to leave Tai Sho for next time because I realised it\'s a cold brew üòÄ
I thought it was only toast and coffee they were well known for.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />The thick gooeyness of the gravy was beckoning to me. Never have I seen such a darkest brown that looked so seductive. Ok... gravy aside. Kway teow was nice but not much of a wokhei. Abundance of sliced beef. For a \"high\", chilli padis recommended.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Slurp it, sip it, whichever way you choose. Not overly fantastic. This is just one of the places to go to satisfy your horfun craving.

Only later did I realised that this is the famous Tong Ah Eating House, the traditional coffee house established since 1939 that serves awesome crispy thin kaya toast.\n<br />.\n<br />The legends are true. The crispy thin kaya toast is good! The kaya is fragrant and less sweet. The soft boiled eggs are also perfrcfly cooked though you have to crack them open yourselves.\n<br />.\n<br />Do you know of other good kaya toasts places in Singapore? Please share with me! ‚ù§\n<br />.\n<br />Tong Ah Eating House\n<br />üìç\n<br />35 Keong Saik Road, Bukit Pasoh Extension Shop House, S089142\n<br />.\n<br />#kayatoast #traditionalbreakfast #jiaklocal #supportlocalfood #tongaheatinghouse

Extremely impressed with their yuanyang (one can argue its the sugar HAHA) and their crispy toast! Not so much with the kaya, which I felt was a bit rough. Price is rather steep as well, and they weren\'t very generous with their filling. Ohwell, at least we got to try what everyone was raving about!

For the best Teh and crispy homemade kaya toasts! We\'re picky about our Tehs and the one here is consistently amazing + absolutely fabulous kaya. Having been spoilt by grandma\'s homemade kaya since young, I tend to find kaya at most places too sweet or not fragrant enough, but the one here comes pretty close. üòç
People recommend it very well so I brought my mom to explore to new breakfast yet it disappointed us. It\'s not much special about this, probably it\'s a very old and last long till now. It is just an average meal to my mom and I.
Buttery and not too sweet, just how I like it.
How I wish I can be out there hunting for good food everyday~\n<br />On a side note, I still prefer the coffee and toast from Ya Kun...
I love this tofu dish so much that I can eat this all myself! The minced meat has so much flavors in it!
Very very addictively nice!!
Above picture: Set C.  So we tried sets A B and C (last set just for the sake of Instagram really) and walked away with a weeks worth of cholesterol in our bellies. Eggs were excellent. Had better toast at Chin Mee Chin, though service there was surlier 
They actually have zi char too which is pretty decent. Ordered one of their signature dish: coffee pork ribs! I like this! But it might be too sweet for some!

Why not take a break from the rat race of chasing new cafes that serves different eggs benedict dishes, artisanal coffee or funky toasts and appreciate the original, authentic Singaporean breakfast/brunch of kopi-png, kaya toast and soft boiled eggs? One place that does that impeccably has definitely got to be Tong Ah Eating House, which has been feeding people since many years ago. I look forward to my next trip to Tong Ah and I will most probably be still ordering the same items again.\n<br />|\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link.\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #sghawker #hawkersg #coffeeshopping
The burnt ends at the of the toast were scrapped off using the top of a milk tin can. Coffee was really silky and fragrant!

From time to time, we should take a well deserved break, sip some kopi, have some toast and just watch the world goes by. One such place that I will recommend is the iconic Tong Ah Eating House that serves some pretty darn good quintessential coffee and toast, or you can call it the Chinese \"brunch\" to make it sound cooler. The art of making coffee though the sock and scrapping off the burnt bits from the toast using the sharp edges of a milk can top dates back to many years and this practice is still being applied today at Tong Ah. No need for any eggs benedict, waffles or pancakes, you just need to order a set of crispy thin toast kaya or fresh toast with kaya, soft boiled eggs and a cup of kopi. After which, sit by the roadside table and appreciate the simple things that mean something.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #sghawker #coffeeshopping #hawkerpedia

üòçüòçThe generous amount of crab meat lends the entire dish a rich crustaceous flavour. üòã Shark\'s fin soup is too overrated lah. #jiakhiddengems #jiaklocal

Kaya toast is always a hit for breakfast.
This is the cup of Kopi that brings you back to the old days; strong Nanyang flavours with just the right amount of condensed milk so it just sweetened, but not just cloying sweet.
turned out to be a pretty damn good idea. #foodporn

Nab!!

good morning #sgfood
Egg bread toast with kaya. I passed on having the traditional kaya butter toast when I saw the lady boss making this. Kaya was very special, nothing like I tasted before. Not too sweet, feels very homemade. The egg bread reminded me of the times I had this for breakfast when I was growing up. And I love that they are serving their coffee with the plastic orange spoon. Who does that now? #nostalgic #oldschool #kaya #egg #bread #lunch #kopi #singapore

This old school coffee house that once stood on this triangular plot of land with its distinctive red and white facade will only appear in our history book #farewell #goodbye #thankyou #singapore #history #food #heritage #heritagegone
It\'s his last day at the iconic Tong Ah Building. Have not tried their famed crispy kaya toast (guess its sold out), but their $1.40 teh c is pretty good. This coffee house has been serving the community since 1939 during the pre war days but was forced to move to a new shophouse a couple doors down the street because the property was sold to a foreign developer. As much as I love Singapore, can\'t help to think how ruthless we can be to our heritage, tearing down a piece of history with just a blink of the eye. And for this reason, we will forever be a cosmopolitan city with no soul. That\'s Singapore for you. #heritagegone #goodbye #farewell #singapore #coffee #lastday
If only in between the bread there is butter, it could be heaven (for me at least) üòãüòÜ
Lunch is üò±üò±4 different types of bread + 2 iced kopi/teh S$10.90 and a fried beef Kwey Teow  S$5.50
