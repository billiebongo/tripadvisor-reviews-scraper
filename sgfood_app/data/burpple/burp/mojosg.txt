Pork Jowl [$6/stick], Diver Scallop [$10/stick], Marbled Beef Striploin [$10], Enokitake [$10], Chicken Kaarage [$15] Mentaiko Salmon [$14] Really love their pork jowl!!! üòã 
So happy to finally check out this place üòã spoilt for choice with all the options and I can foresee myself returning soon! The popular (and Instagram-worthy) choice looked like the #soba &amp; #salmon combination which was a failproof marriage of flavours. With the standard box ($14nett), you can choose 1 base + 1 protein + 3 sides + 1 dressing + 1 topping. All the sides we tried were delicious - saut√©ed mushrooms, caramelized sweet potato, papaya salad, and my favorite - the miso eggplant! Top it off with mixed seeds or nuts, and a drizzle of Mojo garlic vinaigrette üëåüèº #burpple #xuannyeatsclean
A welcome change from the usual chirashi. Quinoa over rice any time!\n<br />-\n<br />Enjoy 1-for-1 drinks (beer &amp; wine) till 9pm on weekdays. Order a plate of Manila Clams ($20) to go along with the tipples.\n<br />-\n<br />#wokyourmojo #mojosg #telokayerstreet #chirashi #quinoa
This was yum. At $14 this is slightly cheaper than Grain Traders but they don\'t charge extra for avocado (super many brownie points for that!!). Everything here was tasty doused in the Asian sauce. Tried a friend\'s sesame sauce and it was good too. Would love to be back but not sure I will take a 15min walk out to Telok Ayer for this on a regular basis...
Had salad @ mojo today. $14 with cha soba, salmon, broccoli, miso with eggplant and pumpkin with carrot. Generally its quite tasty and nice but it is quite oily towards the end. Comparatively more expensive than daily cut which is not far away. We came at around 12:30 so had to wait a bit for the seat and most of the ingredients we want are gone (like avocado).
This grain bowl place just opposite Park Bench Deli on Telok Ayer Street has all the trappings of yet another trendy restaurant jumping on the grain bowl bandwagon, but we\'re happy to report that the bowls are delicious. Opened by Sin Lee Foods and actor Shane Pow, the all-day dining concept serves tasty grain bowls by day. The bowls come in two sizes, Petite ($10) and Regular ($14) and be prepared to exercise your creativity as there are no pre-selected bowls here. In their $14 grain bowls, you get one base, one protein, three vegetables, a choice of sauce and one topping. The base includes brown rice (the most flavourful base in our opinion), soba and spinach, while proteins include salmon (our pick!), beef (additional $1) and tilapia. The bold flavour of the vegetables is what bumps Mojo ahead of its nearby competitors: saucy sauteed mushrooms, refreshing Thai papaya salad and charred corn and broccoli that is reminiscent of Sin Lee Foods\' aburi broccoli. Finish off with the Basil Pesto as your choice of sauce and furikake as your topping. Come night time, this place turns into a vibrant bar serving cocktails, yakitori and tapas.\n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hannah Chew
This is a mix and match that would have me to be spoilt for choice. Love the quinoa that accompanies the runny yolk! üòã give the chunky mushrooms and eggplant a go as well!! üëçüèª‚ú®
Grazed across a few combinations today at the newly-opened Mojo on Telok Ayer and found their sides to be really strong. In fact, a few vegetables, namely the eggplant (this was excellent!), sweet corn, French beans and broccoli threatened to steal the show. Those with big appetites should not miss out on the tastily-done brown rice either. \n<br />A standard $14 serving here gets you a base, a protein (the salmon was my fave), three vegetables and a sauce. If you opt for beef, you\'ll need to top up $1. There\'s also a petite $10 serving for those of you watching your waistlines.
The chunks of mushrooms were magic, the tomatoes and quinoa, really tasty as well. Naturally, the onsen egg could do no wrong too. But personally, I would\'ve preferred a bit more salt thrown on the beef - yes, I like living dangerously üòÅ. This is however, good news for you health-conscious folks who want to keep your sodium intake low. And it isn\'t just the red meat; the same applies to the rest of MOJO\'s proteins.
#MojoSingapore on Telok Ayer, a venture by Mediacorp actor Shane Pow (@shanepowxp) and the team behind @SinLeeFoods, serves up protein-packed salad bowls for lunch, and transforms into a bustling yakitori and drinks spot at night.
Yesterday\'s (relatively) healthy lunch at the newly opened Mojo, serving protein bowls by day, with yakitori and drinks at night.

Comes with an onsen egg and their sauce made the rice really appetising. The beef was in generous portion too, but can be little tough due to its cut. But beef and foiegras would totally work for me. Also in frame, the Roasted Unagi and Uni ($29) was good too. The unagi was well seasoned and the uni comes in decent portion too.\n<br />.\n<br />#mojosg #ricebowl #beef #unagi #foiegras #onthetable
Oooo awesome lunch boxes for $15. #howtonotbefat #mojosingapore #burrple
Having eaten at the restaurant before, the quality of the food still holds up very well after the food delivery process! Beef was cooked perfectly and the thick slab of foie gras made this the perfect decadent for one on a weekday night at home.
#Dinner and #drinks with the Mosaic team tonight instead of training woohoo! üòÅ Much #yumminess at #mojosg yay. üòç\n<br />#wokyourmojo #yummy #food #instafood #foodstagram #donburi #burpple #uni

Though it means \"intense studying time\" for me, hope everyone\'s gonna have a good time, with good company &amp; good food ü§£ Here\'s my bowl from MOJO for lunch the last week. Tried the salmon and egg plant this time. I think I prefer the teriyaki chicken!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #whati8today #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodsg #foodie #foodporn #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #mojosg @burpple @hungrygowhere @mojo.sg
üòî So I treated myself to a bowl of #tender pink #marbled #beef #ribeye and #sinful #foiegras on a bed of moist, fluffy #rice ($25++). üòãüòã In between work emails and messages, but still, #yummy.\n<br />#foodmakesitbetter #foodpics #burpple #nomnom\n<br />#dinner #yestergram #mojobowl #donburi #sgfoodstagram
Wholesome grain bowl joint by day and yakitori bar by night, Mojo\'s pretty compelling no matter whether you\'re visiting for lunch or dinner.

$14\n<br />Texture of brown rice was really good (if that can even go wrong), salmon poached-grilled well but smaller in size compared to \'grain Traders\', papaya salad was really refreshing with a slight spicy kick, sweet potato was too heavily sweetened. Didn\'t choose a sauce to be drenched over cos FOR WHAT? furikake topping never goes wrong.
Foie gras quinoa. Supposedly healthy and gladly tasty. \n<br />#igsg #sgfoodies #sgfood #8dayseat #latergram #throwback #sgig #sgigfoodies #onthetable #foiegras #quinoa #mojosg #telokayer #foodvsco #sgfoodpics #burpple #hungrygowhere #iweeklyeats #vscocam
very impressed with every dish churned out and even more impressed with the extremely attentive service at Mojo! \n<br />favorite dishes of the night were the Aburi Broccoli (so.damn.addictive) and the Mentaiko Salmon (very generous with the mentaiko), and i love the crispness of the deep-fried buns from the Pork Belly Baos. the biggest \"surprise\" was the Garlic Prawns. when the plate arrived, i expected 12 prawns (max) beneath all that bonito flakes but i think there were 30 cos i\'m pretty sure i had more than 20 (stuffed.to.near.death cos the partner in crime couldn\'t eat anymore and only had 5??) anyway, i\'m pretty certain i will be back again very soon, especially when there\'s one-for-one Happy Hour on my fave Moscato. cheers, Kitty ü•Ç see you soon!
Terrible. Overpriced. Food are like 3/4 cooked. One stick of chicken for $5 and its tasteless. The meat is completely bland. Just dipped in teriyaki sauce. The fried squid taste so stale and raw. The only good thing is the 1 for 1 beer.
A new DIY bowl concept in the CBD, except that this is opened by a local celeb in partnership with the folks behind Sin Lee Foods. The good thing is the food doesn\'t need the fame to prop it. Like that they incorporate asian flavours into the selections. Take the saut√©ed mushrooms, which is deliciously soft in savoury Chinese oyster sauce. Also the sweet roasted pumpkin and carrot mix. $14.
Soba, salmon fillet, beansprouts, saut√©ed mushrooms, and carrots, drizzled with Japanese sauce and topped with Japanese Furikake.¬†
