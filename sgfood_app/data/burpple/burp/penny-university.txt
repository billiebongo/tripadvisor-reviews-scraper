This cozy cafe is good for relaxing and has free wifi,it provides water in a wine bottle which is unique,their mains look appetising and is worth going again.
Went to Penny University with my boyfriend for brunch. The food there was definitely hella nice and totally worth the price we paid, although they did not update the menu on their website. The portions served were adequate. In terms of customer service, the people working there were friendly and efficient. Definitely worth the try to go, especially if it\'s your first time coming here.
We tried the Big Breakfast ($16) which they had but there was nothing spectacular about it. The Banana stacks were a huge disappointment, it had a nice aroma but it was extremely sweet and tasted like a chunk of sugar. The Strawberry cake would be lovely with hot tea, but the Nutella Red Velvet cupcake really killed it. Its appearance resembles that of most Red Velvets but upon your first bite, you\'d be married to it. Definitely coming back for more of it and to try out their pastas! Cake Rating: 6.5/10.
Unfortunately we were too full from lunch, the Seasalt Brownie was the only item we could handle amongst the four of us. I also spied some Thai Tea cakes at the corner of my eye.
This was a cafe I\'d wanted to visit for the longest time, finally got to drop by when colleagues decided to drive out for some prawn noodles lunch in the neighbourhood. Totally unplanned, but a nice little mid-day break nonetheless. We had the Chai Steamer with a Seasalt Brownie square.
- #pennyuniversity\'s superb muddy espresso with cold milk &amp; their earl grey cake with cream cheese!
- eggs benny, penny mac and cheese, truffle fries, earl grey cake, muddy espresso with cold milk and iced peppermint chocolate.
This dish took a long time to arrive, but it wasn\'t worth the wait. Comfort food sadly not comforting... mac and cheese was dry and the meat at the bottom was a good surprise.
Hot chocolate drinks tend to be too sweet for my liking but not this one at Penny University. I found it to be aromatic, rich and slightly to the dark side- I like!
but at least I\'ve tried my first @fluffbakery Red Velvet Nutella! So good with that nutella core! Goes great with penny\'s 5oz latte as a very relaxing tgif tea break! üòè Wanted to try the muddy espresso with milk! But forgot again, gives me excuse to head down again soon!
The BLAT $9.50\n<br />The minced beef patty was pink in the center and was very juicy and soft. We enjoyed the sourdough toast which was very crispy and thick. The texture of the cheese was also very hard and I enjoyed the fresh tomatoes which tasted sweet.
Affogato $7\n<br />When the affogato was served to me, the waiter explained that the center cup was the coffee and on the left, it was gula melaka. I was like. WOAH!\n<br />As you gently pour the coffee over the ice cream, it melts the ice cream into a silky, and creamy texture and with the gula melaka, the sweetness offsets the bitterness of the strong coffee. I felt awakened as I sipped the affogato. This is some strong stuff! I enjoyed it so much I will have to order it again soon!
I love the crispy texture of the toast. Everything were perfect together with the poached eggs. Yum yum!
The litmus test for any cafe that specialises in brunch items has to invariably be its Eggs Benedict. I\'m pretty pleased with the one I got at Penny University ‚ò∫Ô∏è My eggs were poached to oozy perfection and beautifully coated in a silky rich Hollandaise. I like mine with served atop brioche and they do that here. If only there were more smoked salmon...
I like how the prices of their breakfast menu are. It\'s cheap and worthy of the price. Similar concept but different style from baked moroccan eggs in tomato sauce. Instead of tomato based, Greek yoghurt is used and eggs are poached. A very refreshing and light taste to the taste buds. A little sourish, and a little flavor from the spice. &amp; it\'s paired with some sourdough stick. Totally feel like a healthy breakfast to start my day! 
Woefully underwhelming. Other than the OK scrambled eggs and canned beans, everything else on the plate left little to be desired; insipid turkey bacon, spongy and tiny chicken chipolatas, a greasy hashbrown, truffled diced mushrooms that tasted extremely strange and what looks to be floppy untoasted gardenia wholemeal bread. It\'s surprising since I really like the other food and coffee here. Much sadz üòû
First time trying marmite and I\'m not a fan at all! Would try the other items though given the reasonably priced menu! 
Comes highly recommended. I love milk so this was fine for me. But would possibly be too weak a coffee shot for people who needed a coffee fix.
2 poached eggs, lightly whipped yoghurt &amp; homemade Harissa &amp; Oregano served with toasted bread. #yummy #love
Perfect amount of cheese and biscuit base, but was disappointed about the lack of earl grey taste despite the title.
They aced it. The combination of the sweet strawberries, blueberries, chewy toasted oats and granola (raisins included) with their homemade vanilla-infused Greek yogurt was simply delicious.
The main I chose for myself out of the very extensive menu! How did it fare for me? \n<br />Check out my review on fatassbean.wordpress.com! Link up on bio!
Can\'t wait to head to one man coffee later for #GivingTuesdaySG!
Beef chirozo with Moroccan spices, stewed tomatoes and a baked egg! Super yummy, but I would suggest this to be a dish to share because it gets kinda overwhelming after awhile!
This was good but I could only eat half of it. The mushroom was too rich or very oily I may say because of the amount of the truffle oil doused on it. The ambience was good for some lone time.
Perfectly Poached Eggs with Turkey Ham on top of toasted sourdough bread. $15 A little pricey. But definitely a must-try.
Start the day right with this healthy salad bursting with colour and flavour. Packed with chicken chunks, carrots, mandarin and orange segments, cherry tomatoes and rocket, then drizzled with an addictive orange mustard vinaigrette. If you are tired of the usual eggs benedict, get this.
Forgotten the name but it taste talk good.  Juicy n buttery. :)
Juicy and yums.  Tho conventional kind of sandwich the sauce gave the beef a different kinda twist.
Just a chicken ham croissant. Good for tea break,  not to spoil your appetite for dinner.
2 poached eggs in yoghurt, topped with harissa oil and oregano, with toasted bread.  Hearty but healthy. $8
Eggs Benedict and Blat with some really really good coffee. The carrot cake is really great too! Inexpensive for it\'s great taste. Def should try it!
(Part 3: 16 Oct) Birthday celebration with my favourite girls‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° It\'d always been a joy to meet up with these girls. Thank you for the present girls! I love it! Let\'s jiayou for our upcoming finals!!
Love that the poached eggs had some kind of lemon or citrusy sauce glazed over it.
A little too sweet for my liking. Apart from that it is moist and chewy, not bad at all except you don\'t really get very much Nutella taste. Too pricey too. 
The first ever cafe that I visited and it was so good. Worth trying is really their eggs benedicts! Their hollandaise sauce is so good. Also try their ice chocolate and their coffees are one of the better ones out there #pennyuniversity #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #burpple
The name sounds so attractive, doesn\'t it? Imagine eating milk and cookies with ice-cream in between. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
I find the ice-cream too sweet but the presentation is so pretty. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
It consists of the usual: eggs (scrambled, poached or sunny side-up), baked beans, thick toast, hash brown, sausage and bacon (they used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon). Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
This cake reminds me of the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I used to eat when I was a child. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
Post National Day celebration with my colleagues, and we had a feast thereWill slowly upload all the other food. Simply love the cozy ambience and awesome all-day breakfast.
Banana cake was moist and salted caramel frosting did not overpower the cake. Cake slices could be thinner though because it makes you feel like you are have 2 pieces of cake. They could try serving only 1 slice and then smacking the frosting on the cake. Pair this up with a cup of espresso with milk 
While I\'m there to QC of course lol
Nicely plated Ice Cream Cookie from Ice Cream &amp; Cookie Co by Penny University 
Because class ended 1.5hours early. Best first day of school ever
Ordered Cesar salad, chocolate brownie n  mint choc drink.. awesome ambience with friendly staff!
The Grasshopper Pie is outsourced from Windowsill Pies, which has produced many lovely pies but this just wasn\'t one of them. The chocolate was way too mild to complement the mint, which came through very strongly. :(
Which cuppa caught ur fancy?
Light, very soft and moist - perfect chiffon. Could taste the matcha too :) Makes for a wonderful tea time snack.
I sure feel lucky today with the guest blend on a happy Sunday ^^
Because i loooove cinnamon and the hot Saturday night was compelling me to indulge in ice cream. A thick wedge of vanilla ice cream studded with diced apple sandwiched between two cinnamon sugar cookies - actually a pretty great way to end off our salt-laden meal at Hana Hana
One of the must-try! At $7.50, this piece of cake is worth every penny. Avocado taste did not overpower the cheese flavours so it\'s just right for me. 
Lol... If I get money eat time I yawn I think I would be rich, just by today!
Penny University, a famous coffee joint at the east side of little red dot. Their coffee and cakes hit the soft side of me but I would definitely prefer to visit them during weekdays when they are less crowded. Penny University surely knows their crowd well for sure! 
Overhyped place to hang out on the weekends. Hence; they serve really good pastries &amp; coffees. It runs out unknowingly so be sure to hunt them down as early as you can!
This rocks! This is a must try, it\'s dat finger-licking good 
And I do mean cool in more ways than one. With the ample lightly whipped yogurt coddling the poached eggs, the temperature of this dish is significantly lower than expected. Not that it\'s negative in any way, just surprising. A homemade spicy Harissa sauce gives a warm dimension, and there\'s sourdough toast for dipping. Very reasonably priced at $8 flat.
No cappuccinos or lattes here. Simply state if you\'d like milk in your coffee and choose from the 3, 5 and 7oz. cup sizes. The bigger the cup, the milkier the coffee. Which by the way, is roasted by Oriole, and is pretty darn excellent.
Marmite fans, you\'ll be mighty glad to know these poached eggs on sourdough toast come with maasdam cheese, and more importantly, your favourite savoury spread. I am still wide-eyed with disbelief over the $6.50 price tag for this tasty and rather filling dish.
Moist cake which was well complimented by the caramelized apple slices on the top. Best paired with a cup of espresso
This is must-try! Tangy, sweet, sour, all in one. Every bite is a piece of heaven. I am definitely trying the other desserts next time. Verdict: 5/5
Very delish.. salmon was fresh n tender, avocado cream tasty and garden salad fresh! Worth it. Verdict : 4.5/5
Grilled potatoes was tasty, salad was fresh, chicken was well-marinated but a tad undercooked. Verdict: 3.5/5
We shared an ice cream sandwich (chocchipcookieXvanilla) and i chose the muddy espresso to go along with it. Instead, I fell in love with his hot chocolate. Everything is the usual cafes\' pricing. Wish to come back in the daytime to try out their savouries. And maybe a pie too! :)\n<br />#pennyuniversity #cafehoppingSG #cafehopping #coffee
Description: Served with creamy feta cheese, sliced baked potatoes, onions and mustard spread on brioche.
Description: Guacamole and mustard spread, cream cheese, capers and sprinkle of oregano on brioche.

How many times have i had this..
Taste great even as take out 
This is a die die must try for coffee fans! Made my day : )
 I still prefer the yellow bird. Nothing beats that so far!
The scones are good! Oh this is a must try, it melts in the mouth.
Combination of the setting between the cafe and indoor. Simply loving this 
Used to come here for great Fluffbakery cupcakes, but still coming here for the coffee and relatively cheap breakfasts! If you\'re not that adventurous, DO NOT try Turkish eggs (Poached eggs with greek yogurt).
Poached eggs with yogurt, harissa and smoked salmon, and toasted bread. Freaking delicious!
eggs Benedict weren\'t good.. the yolks didn\'t flow out :((( but the desserts were exceptionally good! (esp ice cream sandwich)
Peanut butter cookie with cheesecake ice cream... Wow.... The cookie is a bit dry but if eat as a whole... Ts just  taste so good... CheeEcake ice cream\'s taste doesn\'t overpower the cookie... Each have ts own taste... Niceeeeee 
Managed to visit my fav caf√© after my last paper. Great ambience to relax. #goodlife #cafehopping #pennyuniversity
Kitchen was closed for dinner so we came back for #dessert. Tasted too medicinal like. :(
mouthgasm//gooey yolk. \n<br />all time favorite breakfast,\n<br />eggs benedict #foodporn #throwback
Two poached eggs on lightly whipped yoghurt with smoked salmon, topped with homemade spicy Moroccan Harissa sauce and oregano leaves. Served with toasted bread. $11
Eggs Benedicts and Turkish Eggs (?) I think for Brunch! It was hella good. Accompanied with some hot chocolate.
Can\'t ever go wrong with poached eggs and hot chocolate 
Reached the place past 4:30pm was asked to wait since the place is full. We got a table around 5:02pm placed an order only to find out that the kitchen was already closed! What pissed me off was that the staff couldve informed us when he asked us to wait, then maybe we can order in advance while waiting to be seated. We waited 30 mins all for nothing! Oh well... We were left with few choices so we just ordered cappucino hot chocolate, baby cino and banoffe pie. We loved the pie but the drinks were just so so.
Finally here, after hearing so much about them üòÖ
Penny U has a really nice vibe, with interesting pieces of furniture that emphasise the hipster feel. I was initially surprised that I liked the Turkish eggs as there was something interesting dipping my sourdough bread in the mix of yogurt, eggs and spices. The peppermint chocolate was really rich and appropriate for the cool Christmas season. If only Penny U was in a larger space! 
I sure miss my fix : )
For the sweet tooth!
Enjoyed this slice of cake much. I thought the earl grey nodes made a great match with the smooth cheesecake, and the crumble layer at the bottom was quite perfect. 4/5
Peanut butter ice cream sandwich and grasshopper mint pie. So good. #omnomnom
Needs min. double shot!
And look at the generous amount of hollandaise sauce! Wooooots! *gives stamp of approval* :D
They describe their Signature drink as \"A reverse latte where cold milk is added first before the espresso shot\". I see this drink on almost every table!
This is delicious and so pretty!! The ice cream doesn\'t melt easily too!! 
poached eggs with smoked salmon #sgfood was offered an item of choice from the menu (on top of my existing order) bcos they missed this out from my order. excellent service!! @pennyuniversity
Soft mint and chewy chocolate cake sandwiching thicker chocolate finished with a thick crust. $8 a slice. 
Something you\'ll never see on the brunch menu of other cafes. I love how quaint, strong yet well infused everything taste! Must try! 
It\'s a sandwich, decently done! Though, quite lacking in taste perhaps because I like my things tasty and salty. 
Not your regular ice latte, richer yet smooth and has a tinge of sweetness I can\'t quite put its origin. 
To the salted caramel fan, the slice is a must try, absolutely divine! Blueberry tart is pretty good too, blueberry being very generous and not too sweet/more sour that sweet, the way I like it. 
Carrot cake is decent, nothing surprising. But I love the mint pie! It is not too heavy, not too sweet and with hidden chunks of brownie. And the crispy pie crust adds texture to it.
The combination of toasts and Marmite is something new and worth trying. But it gets a little salty towards the end and the poached egg was overcooked.
Ordered flat white but was told that they\'ve combined cappuccino, flat whites into espresso w milk. Still thick and good.
$8 French toast with berries, maple syrup, butter. Added smoked salmon at $2! Everything on their menu is 
+$1.50 for turkey ham. The best friend admitted turkish eggs with turkey ham sounded ridiculous. Poached Eggs with yoghurt? Tasted strangely sour but the best friend liked it. Served with sourdough bread.
Lovely place to spend the afternoon!
Love the smoked chicken sandwich. Also like the concept tt you get t try desserts from Windowsill and Icecream &amp; sandwich co! Killing 3 birds w 1 stone. Haha
Good to be back in the east. Totally love the sign ‚òû Let Your Children BOOGIE!
Greeted by coffee aroma when i entered PU. Had a 5oz Espresso with milk which was ok. Turkish eggs were not bad. Tad oily though. The eggs were not runny, sadly. 
Chocolate caramel pudding &amp; Carrot cake. Chocolate caramel pudding was ok but it could have been better if it was sea salt caramel! 
Just the right amount of sweet. Rich brownie chunks are buried here and there in the light chocolate mousse. Best paired with a muddy espresso.
The warm, earnest attitude at Penny U is something you pick up on quickly once stepping into this homey space. These guys don\'t believe in mass production, and have a small, rotating selection of desserts from artisanal bakers around Singapore. Inspired by the cafes in London, Penny U spearheaded the cafe culture in the East, and is already highly regarded by cafe lovers- Easties and Westies alike.
Cafe latte x French toast in a cozy lil place. #cafe #coffee #toast
Turkish eggs! Love the sour cream but it\'s not for everybody.

‚òÜ Overrated
‚òÜ Not the best brunch around. Halah certified though.
Had the Full English Breakfast [$16] with a Peppermint Hot Chocolate [$5.50]. The first cafe I encountered that serves peppermint chocolate and I knew I had to try it. Enjoyed the slight hint of peppermint with every sip. Also love how the peppermint taste wasn\'t too overpowering. Sadly, I can\'t say the same for the English Breakfast meal. The toasted sourdough bread was way too hard. As for the chicken chorizos, I found the pepper taste too overwhelming. I was also disappointed that the turkey bacon wasn\'t crispy. But oh well, it might just be this visit that the standard was not up to mark as I have read so many good reviews regarding Penny University. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #sgeats #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #burpple #openricesg #instafood_sg #instafoodie

All Day #Breakfast @ Penny University
Turkish eggs + sourdough toast with smoked salmon + devil choc cake + Lemon yuzu meringue + muddy espresso . 
In my opinion, key to a wonderful smoked salmon dish is how you diminish that strong salmon flavour with pepper or what not while still keeping that distinct taste. They did it brilliantly.
‚ô°
Penny University serves all day breakfast, which is pretty cool for people like me who enjoys breakfast all day. I can really have this #eggbenedict anytime of the day. For those who aren\'t a big fan of salmon, here is an option to change the #smokedsalmon to #bacon.
