YAKULT ICE CREAM. I need to get some nowwww and I\'m really bored. help. A place to get your ice cream fix after having cakes at ciel! Hehe!
A new ice cream joint has opened within Lorong Ah Soo that has interesting ice cream flavours, such as Yakult Cookies (a combination between Cookies n Cream and Yakult) and Poach Pear. This Waffles with Yakult Cookie and Poach Pear ($9.50) gives the combination between sweet and sour as the Yakult Cookie provides a sourish taste to the Cookies n\' Cream while the Poach Pear provides an additional sweetness to the pear flavor.
chayen + roasted pistachio 🍦
Reasonably priced dessert place that opens till late (2am/3am) and is super generous with the ice-cream serving.
a chillax place for all the sweet-tooth lovers out there..all made out of love with unique flavours catering to all taste buds!
Yakult Oreo &amp; Cookie Monster.
😛 @lickouricecream still serves one of the best ice creams in the neighborhood.
Oh well, I guess sometimes, you just have to give in to temptations. 😆💕 No regrets! 👍💯 (Date: 12 June 2016 Sunday) #MsJaniceEats_icecream

Waffles done neither too crispy nor too soft, tasted ever so impeccable. Very generous with their scoops &amp; and quirky flavours.

Should be about time they give us waffle emoji?
Gula melaka ice-cream taste average though, would be good if it\'s creamier.. #dessert #icecream #instagood #foodlover #vscofood #onthetable #whati8today #food #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodporn #foodpornography #getinmybelly #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #happytummy #foodphotography #foodpics #icapturefood #foodstamping #openricesg #burpple

here\'s a new one month old ice cream shop, beside ciel patisserie! did not take a picture of my ice cream, but they were really generous with the scoop. their flavors are really interesting as well, had maple latte + dark chocolate, which was almost the same standard as awfully chocolate\'s signature hei ice cream?! but only $6.30 for a double scoop!
Made with fresh fruit puree, it is not like ur usual ice cream. I could taste the fiber from the fruit. Yum yum
