Pimp my breakfast (24)-had mine with pumpernickel, scramble, spinach and lobster lobster did not exactly taste fresh, the scramble were really silky though. 3.5/5
Another brunch serving cafe. Homy place and has a good service
Having my favourite roast chicken at Lokal\'s Sunday Roast event was something I had always wanted to do and have finally done it last weekend. The roast chicken never fails to impress and I found out the secret is to soak the chicken in brine before roasting! The set comes with mash, sautéed vegetable and the Yorkshire pudding - which locals would call it roti. Would have asked for more brown sauce next time as it\'s all soaked into the mash. Tasty tasty tasty of simple honest food yet again.
Had paired it with chocolate ice cream previously and preferred that pairing. I liked the dates flesh embedded within the batter.
Thanks to The Lokal team for sending this Pavlova over to our table. My friend and I may have been stuffed from lunch but that didn\'t stop us from gleefully launching an attack.\n<br />How could we possibly not be excited to taste fresh soursop, passionfruit and roasted pineapples heaped on to light-as-air, crisp meringue. Its description on the \"specials\" board had already caught our attention when we walked in. Well, it turned out just like I\'d anticipated: refreshing and fruity, with a lovely balance struck between sour and sweet.\n<br />Congrats Chef Darren on adding yet another tempting dessert to your repertoire 👍😋
So, the single kale leaf is quite sad. However, how loaded is this with mortadella slices? This was super meaty and the cured meat went very nicely with the onion jam and asiago cheese. Good but I struggled to finish it.
The only lobster roll worth talking (I\'m not raving) about. No complex mayo-dressing, just simple honest ingredients, Lokal-style to bring out the sweetness of the crustacean\'s natural flavours, complimented by the tangy fresh purple cabbage slaw and diced gherkins.
Tbh...how do you justify spending $16 on mediocre banana bread??
Weekend special: Sheered pig\'s head roulade with kale/ carrot coleslaw and Victorian fresh truffle shavings, served with toasted sour dough.
Vegetarian friendly Aussie-inspired cafe with rustic feel. Awesome homemade breads, yoghurt, dips, condiments etc. made from scratch. Quite crowded for a weekend brunch. We have had Toastie of The Day (buttery toasts filled with mashed spinach, cheese, mushroom), Cream of Pumpkin (Soupy, I personally prefer creamier &amp; thicker soup base), homemade Vanilla yoghurt (Yum!), homemade kimchi (Drool), custom-made brunch plate, Healing Garden herbal tea. Overall a wonderful brunch experience with cozy ambience!
The sticky sauce was superb and it went really well with the ice cream and the cake. Absolutely stunning! Just get this and dont question.
Really satisfying half chicken with good flavour and tenderness. The king ouster mushroom had an amazing smokiness and the potatoes mopped up the fabulous sauce well. Overall really value for money compared to some of the other mains
Red snapper with flower crab, clams and mild laksa. Red snapper had a crispy salty skin but the flesh in contrast had no taste. And it was slightly dry as well. The flower crab was really fresh and sweet, with massive amounts of roe. Laksa broth was way too mild for us and more attuned to the taste of their target customers.
Its another reason to visit! Didnt made any reservation on a fri night, but we were lucky, we got a counter seat. Enjoyed watching the chef preparing our food. Ordered Grouper fish and chips ($28++) and slipper lobster pasta ($26++). Both were so good! This is so worth it. We end our night with dessert - sticky date pudding with vanilla icecream ($10++) and an additional scoop of Hocky pokey icecream ($4++)\n<br />Some might find it rather sweet, but i like the sweetness level. 👍🏻4/5\n<br />✔️Going to use finish the entertainer discount before this year end!!\n<br />📍136 Neil Road #yybffoutrampark
I love a good seafood pasta and this one did not disappoint. The tomatoey shellfish stock was rich, briny and umami packed - but not sickening. This coupled with buttery linguine was so good, I could eat this for days. 
In desperate need of comfort food, I went for the beef cheek on the sole basis that it came with mashed potatoes. This beautiful dish not only delivered super buttery &amp; creamy mash, it came with roasted carrots, pickled shallots and a large hunk of braised beef cheek, all doused in thick beefy gravy. The beef was rich &amp; deep in flavour, and so meltingly tender you could eat it with a spoon. 
There is no photoshop of filters used here. The cured salmon are crimson red or blood orange in colour. The curing is done to perfection (in-house, most certainly) preserving the tenderness of the fish and yet doesn\'t get overwhelmingly saltish when compared to smoked salmon. Goes very well with the chilled soba in soy dressing and sprinkled on with sesame. Perhaps a little more dressing and some greens might give more dimension to the freshness of this dish!
I liked how we can customise our own breakfasts here. I had 2 poached eggs, wholegrain toast and wilted spinach, while he had sunny side ups instead, and added whole slipper lobster tail! You can even pick your preferred spread (butter/jam/vegemite etc). Everything I had was excellent, and the service was great too. If not for the insane crowds, I will definitely come here often!
Superb sticky date pudding ($10) that is perfectly balanced between lightness and density accompanied by a wonderful and creamy vanilla ice cream to balance the sweetness of the dish. Sweetest end to a perfect meal (&amp; literally a bit too sweet for my friends)
Ordered the Lokal Ricotta ($20), Toastie of the day ($14.90), Steak and Eggs ($26) and shared truffle fries ($10) and the sticky date pudding ($10). So much love for this place knowing that there\'s hardly anything that will disappoint! Fantastic stuff with great service and a bustling energy that doesn\'t get too noisy or intrusive.
A burger with just beef and a perfect sunny side up can be yummy too. :) Downside is their food items are on the pricey side and the burger could be better with a few sides.
Fantastic service and an excellent menu! I truly loved the Lobster Linguine - the pasta was cooked to perfection with a rosé sauce (a mix of red and white pasta sauce) and topped with whole slipper lobsters. A must-try for pasta fanatics!
If you are craving for a breakfast that satisfy your sweet tooth, this is recommended! Vanilla yoghurt goes well with the banana bread😋
Hadn\'t been back to The Lokal for brunch in a while and they had since refreshed their menu. This Grilled Mortadella Ciabatta fits smaller appetites that crave for meats — it\'s a pretty compact sandwich that sees Kale, Cheese, Mortadella (an Italian sausage) and Onion Jam in between crisp Ciabatta bread grilled. The Mortadella carries flavours reminiscent of luncheon meat; a very comforting flavour especially given how this tasted exceptionally clean without being overly briny and salty — in fact, it\'s so clean it leaves no aftertaste. The cheese is all satisfying, giving the pull desired in cheese sandwiches without being overly cheesy (after all, this ain\'t a grilled cheese sandwich) while the kale gives it a good balance with some greens in between the cheese and meat. Certainly one of those sandwiches I wouldn\'t mind eating even if I am craving something lighter than a full-sized sandwich.
A good chill drink for a hot day after work out. The slightly zesty coffee bean taste makes a refreshing kick to start the day
Panini style ciabatta with stack of ham, onion jam and kale.
I liked my salad very much but my boyfriend\'s sausage platter was lacklustre. Definitely not worth $21++! Anyway, what disappointed me about this place was the unwelcoming vibes. They were prompt and actually polite but we felt so hurried while eating. I understand that they are very popular but when I still had a substantial amount of food on my plate and was using my phone, one of the servers tried to clear our table :/ Not so long after we did finish our meal, we were asked (nicely) to vacate the table as they had a waiting list. That\'s fine, but there were other tables that had patrons who have been at the restaurant a longer time, why ask us to leave before them? So that sucked. Overall it was a really bad experience for me, even the food couldn\'t save it.

.\n<br />|\n<br />Lokal post had been my annual Chinese New Year post. While most of the cafes or restaurants are closed, Lokal is open for breakfast and brunch. .\n<br />|\n<br />Grilled sausage sat on cloudy mash and flooded with comforting brown sauce. .\n<br />|\n<br />The flesh of one lobster was found in lobster roll. This was all you need to know. 😋😋😋
Sticky date pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream at $10, goes well together. Not too bad at all! #BurppleXChope
Really love the ambience of the cafe. It is a good place to chill and talk over drinks or food. Pictured is the truffle parmesan fries that we had. The fries came to our table pipping hot and each fry was crisp and fluffy on the inside. The only thing lacking was that we felt the fries could do with a bit more salt and parmesan flavour. The truffle flavour was just right. Nonetheless, I love the ambience and I would love to come back to chill for brunch! #BurppleXChope
Until now, I still do not know how to pronounce this cafe. Is Lokal pronounced as \'Local\' or \'Lo-kal\'? Well that is a question still in speculation. Regardless, everything from the ambience, the decor, the smell, right down to the dishes, surpassed my expectations. A cosy cafe on the curb, the interior decorations were colourful and rejuvenating. The smell of the coffee, which enticed us to ordering the cappuchino and vanilla latte ($5.50 each), was simply divine. The coffee was definitely one of the better ones around, with the distinct aroma of the coffee beans and the sweetness of the vanilla being the perfect pick me up. We ordered the ricotta toast - ricotta, pomelo and avocado on a bed of sourdough toast (approx $19) as well as the roast beef sandwich - sauerkraut, mustard, greens and beef on wholemeal bread ($19), both of which were so tasty and worth every cent. A side of truffle fries ($10) was the sweet finish, with the underlying truffle taste in every bite. I have been very lucky with the cafes i have patroned in terms of the quality of food. This makes me happy :-)
No chicken is spared here! Not even if this is the year of the rooster/chicken.
Sadly, I think their brunch or lunch menu is more appealing. Perhaps I should have their beef instead? Haha! #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg
so when lokal first popped up, they served AMAZING french toast and banana bread drenched in the most amazing sauce. however the food starting getting real shit and all the flavors just weren\'t hitting the right spots. a year later i decided to give lokal another try and I AM SO GLAD THAT THEY ARE BACK IN THE GAME wooooooo! this time the french toast wasn\'t drenched in syrup but flavors were so on point so i guess that worked out. also, the sausages were AMAZING and a must-get item!!
Lamingtons are a hard find in Singapore — more so a good one. A cake with Australian origins, Lamingtons are sponge cake that traditionally comes with a layer of chocolate coated on the exterior while coming with a good amount of desiccated coconut sprinkled over the top. The Lokal serves two variants today — the traditional chocolate one as well as this Matcha variant. Carrying a rather light whiff of matcha aroma, cutting it apart reveals a vanilla sponge which is light and fluffy while accompanying it is the strong coconut aroma that sets the Lamington apart from a usual sponge cake. Would have to try even more Lamingtons to see how they are generally like but I am definitely pretty satisfied with this version.
I bet my bottom dollar this creamy cocktail will put a smile on your face. If it isn\'t that adorable duck that does it, then the high alcoholic content will.\n<br />Thanks @fuzzychef for introducing me to the first cocktail you ever learned to make - the \"Fluffy Duck\". I can easily down a flock of these! 😆😆😆
We meet again, my dear old friend 😍 What is it about you that I find so bewitching? Is it your tender, moist roast chicken? That crispy, non-oily dry-cured bacon? The voluptuous creaminess from smashed avocado? Or perhaps it\'s the house-churned butter that gets spread over your fluffy ciabatta? Hmmm, or could it be the cheeky splash of balsamic vinegar on your sea salt-sprinkled tomatoes?
The coffee is good. We ordered decaff since i can\'t take coffee but just want a sip. The fish and chips is not bad; crispy outside and moist inside but my friend said its alittle fishy. Pork belly is not bad too. Roast chicken is tender but on the salty side. Desserts are way too sweet for my liking, even for my friend who loves desserts commented that it was too sweet. The food comes in very small portion and in 3s so if you have more than 3 persons, you have to order another portion. We had to order a few extra dishes since we weren\'t full and their dinner menu is limited. For that kind price, its not really worth going again though i read their sunday brunch is good..maybe just maybe will try it. Coffee drinkers will like this place.
Simple yet so satisfying. Butter crusted outer layer is so fragrant.
Have been so long since I came out for brunch ☺️. Sour dough w home made ricotta and smashed avocado was pretty good..but I realised I can make ricotta myself too loll . Btw why are the almonds naked? #burpple #brunch #sourdough #ricotta #sgcafe

The only downfall is that we finished the ice-cream and still had much of the cake left over. The ratio looks right here but the overly sweet cake requires the vanilla ice-cream to balance out the flavours. \n<br />The mains here are pretty decent though this was the dish that left an impression for me here. \n<br />#burpple
Always love dining at The Lokal on Friday nights where you can enjoy good food and drinks at affordable prices.

Thick and crunchy toasted white bread served with butter, homemade kaya and slow cooked egg. The homemade kaya is simply awesome, very fragrant with a hint of gula melaka and is not overly sweet. Slow cooked egg is perfect as a dip for the bread too.\n<br />🍞\n<br />But I have a problem, with only 4 slices of bread, shall I dip them in the slow cooked egg or eat them with the yummy kaya spread?

My all time favourite.. This is what makes me go back again and again!
Named after a German word for \"local\", LoKal is not your typical local food nor does is serve up German food. In fact, it is modelled after an Australian cafe offering favourites like fish n\' chips but with their unique twist like the chilli coriander mayonnaise which was spicy and zesty altogether, really tasty!! (For my full review, check out mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg) 
Its great to be dining in The Lokal ! Excellent and friendly service, sure makes food more enjoyable.\n<br />Here, we have a chocolate mousse accompanied with homemade kaya and cookies ! \n<br />Felt that the cookies were really great addition to go with the chocolate mousse which was heavy on the palate and gives an added texture to the dessert, like a tart haha. Also, I feel the kaya wasn\'t needed since the chocolate wasn\'t that bitter to have the kaya for some balance.\n<br />Great for sharing!
Comfort warm toasted banana bread! Always hit the spot. Simple pleasures.
Truffle fat fries - made the mark, but not awesome. The must-order here is the moist yet fluffy, so-warm sticky date pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and scotch sauce ($10). A tad sweet, so get it to share. 
Bun was a little dry. Nice crunch and acidity from the kimchi, but the creme fraiche was a little out of place. Decent.
I love banana bread and I have high standards for it. And holy crap this was good. Moist banana bread with caramelised bananas, a hint of orange(?), crunchy macadamia nuts and creamy yoghurt. Definitely a winner. Steep at $14 but it was a big portion (and the entertainer app helped defray the cost...). 
Yummy indulgence 😋👍🏻\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $50\n<br />Find out more:\n<br />http://wp.me/p73MHP-1o\n<br />————————————————————————
\nBesides coming in a hearty portion, this is one very attractive looking salad. Chef Darren\'s expert combination of roasted pumpkin, green beans, pickled beetroot, quinoa, dried cranberries, sprouts and seeds, all tossed in a whey dressing, conjures up a fresh combo that simply dazzles with multiple flavours and textures.
Great combi for banana bread with vanilla yoghurt &amp; macademia nuts ! Interesting food 😋
Another view of the eye catching salad.
Opted the healthy option which is an interesting and beautiful kale salad. Comes with beet root, okra, pomegranate, red onion, sesame in a tangy lemon dressing. Can\'t go wrong with Lokal\'s signature roast chicken.
Pulled Pork Belly, Cucumber, Homemade Kimchi, Sriracha, Creme Fraiche. It\'s been a long time since I have been to The Lokal, and thought it would be good to drop by as their launch a revised menu today. One of the more Asian-influenced items on the menu, this burger felt generally well-executed but not really something that suited my palate. I like how they included chunks of tender pork belly around for the extra chew and the pulled pork was just of the right consistency; just moist enough without being too wet and the cucumbers added a crunch to the tangy yet spicy kimchi that gives this a slight kick in flavour. For me, I enjoyed the burger for how it was done but the flavours didn\'t seem to bind especially for the Creme Fraiche in particular — injected a little too much sourness and a causes a bit of confusion of flavours for the otherwise decent burger; would have preferred perhaps Gochujang that could integrate better with the kimchi. Still, I would definitely try out their The Lokal Breakfast Burger some day; definitely looks like the sort of classic brunch dish they would do well!
\nWhat struck me first about the brownie was its massive size. I don\'t recall ever being served one this huge anywhere else before. After I had a bite of it, I was even more impressed. Think of it as soft and very warm fudge - extremely chocolatey, with a thick, slightly sticky yet easy-to-chew texture. When eaten with the smooth, rich vanilla ice-cream, it was heavenly.
Currywurst ($8) was the most addictive as chilli and curry sauce on sausage and fries brought back many fond memories during my travels in Berlin, Germany. Once again, congratulations on this special day and many well wishes for years to come.\n<br />.\n<br />The LoKal\n<br />Address: 136, Neil Road, Singapore 088865
Pictures and words do not do this dessert any justice at all. This is beyond words unbelievable - but also a huge sweet bomb. Moist, fluffy, delicious, this was so nice to dig into. It was so so so soft, almost sponge like, soaking up all the lovely caramel. Digging into it, and finding bits of dates hidden here there everywhere was also an absolute delight. (They do not skimp on true dates!) Hands down my favourite dish here. Be right back as I dream of this tonight. 
Finally a cafe that caramelises their bananas well! I liked how this banana bread wasn\'t too dense, a lot more fluffier and airy than most banana breads, which paired well with their tangy sour yogurt. So happy I made the trip here after hearing Burppler @veronicaphua rave about this 🍌. 
Smashed avocado topped with pomelo and almonds with homemade ricotta, all my fav healthy fats in one dish! Absolutely in love with this homemade ricotta. It\'s not overly cheesy, but instead light and fragrant, and almost even mildly sweet. Didn\'t expect myself to like the ricotta that much - now I want to buy some and take it home. 
The pudding was serve hot with rich caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream ,you will love this little dessert for sure .if you are sticky date pudding lover ,do try it out in Oriole coffee +bar at somerset outlet ,I find it that one is nicer than this !😜
We missed the brunch time instead we having dinner ,order their daily special beef steak !medium rare is perfect cook for us ,my first time having beef steak served with lemon sauce ,very refreshing taste ,download the hollerout apps and quote \"Kx_chee0505\" to enjoy 10% off if you spend more than $ 50.00!

Nice savory started. Crispy potato top with smoked salmon and fish roe. Loved it
Because of that, I definitely will not miss this opportunity to order The LoKal Lobster Roll ($22).\n<br />.\n<br />What came was slightly underwhelming as it does not come with curly fries as per the photos that you see on their website or Instagram. Instead, chunky fries were served. Furthermore, the bread roll was kinda cold and dry, which totally was uncalled for. The only saving grace were the main ingredients of slipper lobster tails that were blanched to the right texture and the mixture of gherkins and coleslaw which brought about a nice tanginess.\n<br />.\n<br />The LoKal\n<br />Address: 136, Neil Road, Singapore 088865

Extremely tender soft beef cheek meat that really really easy to eat that doesn\'t have any gamey taste at all. Ah Ma Liu and all her dentures approves 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻. Served with comforting mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. This has got to be a real Good Friday night dinner - don\'t forgot to order their Sticky Date Pudding ($10) that never fails to impress for a perfect sweet ending to the week!
Great food with great company! And woohoo it\'s on the entertainer app!
Located at the junction between Neil Road and Bukit Pasoh Road, this perpetually buzzy cafe offers brunch and coffee in the day, and tasty dinner mains in the evening. Gather your friends and challenge one another to create the most innovative breakfast plate. Called Pimp Your Breakfast, The Lokal offers a pretty extensive selection, although we always return to our favourites — house-smoked mackerel or salmon ($6), handmade ricotta ($5), wilted spinach ($4), sauteed mushrooms ($5) and eggs done any way ($5). For a sweeter start to the day, go for the Toasted Banana Bread ($16) with homemade vanilla yoghurt and toasted macadamia nuts. Burpple Tastemaker Veronica Phua deems it the best banana bread in Singapore! The coffee (from $4) here is decent but we generally prefer it a little less acidic. When night falls, the ambience gets a lot more intimate, so save an evening visit for your date. We enjoyed the Roasted Kampong Chicken ($26) and Crispy Battered Fish &amp; Chips ($28). Make sure you order the amazing Sticky Date Pudding ($10) to share! Pro-tip: It can get very crowded on the weekends, so be prepared to wait.
Healthy tasty and awesomely rich in nuts and seeds. I would definitely recommend this for a meal if you wanna enjoy healthy lifestyle and fulfilling meal. 
Utterly disappointed by the service. Took more than 30 mins to arrive. 1-for-1 was not available on the day, but the waitress was ill-informed and the floor manager shocked me after the dishes came. @thelokalsingapore The fish itself was okay, but the Kangkung (water spinach) was over cooked and had grits of soil inside. Sticky date pudding was good and was the only saving grace for the day, albeit the small scoop of vanilla. 😟 Would you come back? No.
That steaming soft, moist pudding drenched in oh-so-lovely dark dark caramel. That intense, dark, molassey goodness of the caramel gets me every single time - almost a little smokey. Perhaps we will see an experimental smoked caramel with the pudding sometime soon. Mmmmm.
The Lokal Lobster Roll ($22++) &amp; Latte ($5++). Finally got to try the lobster roll which is only available on weekdays brunch time. It was a hugh portion. I\'d wished the bun was buttered and toasted. The roll was lacking a sauce and I didn\'t notice there was supposed to be lemon mayo. Was it a dressing for the slaw or slipper lobster? Nonetheless, the slipper lobster was succulent. The slaw and gherkin were fresh and crunchy. Fries were done crispy outside and fluffy inside. Washed down with a full bodied latte :)
If I am in that rare mood to start my day on the right note (my default breakfast setting tends to be stuck on greasy local delights like \"char beehoon\" and \"wanton mee\" 😁😁 ), this new-ish item at The Lokal is actually the ideal thing for me. The portion is small but oh boy, it sure is packed to the gills with healthy goodness. I tried the version with fermented bananas and loved the refreshing coldness of the fruit (it had been soaked in buttermilk). Just so you know, they also offer a mixed fruit salad one if bananas aren\'t your thing. I reckon this would make a perfect snack after a yoga or workout session as well.
It\'s very reassuring when you return to a place you haven\'t been to in a long while and everything is as good as ever, if not better.\n<br />I wanted to save tummy space for my favourite, the Banana Bread. So it was necessary to \"pimp my breakfast\" in a modest fashion; which I did with fried eggs, shredded roast chicken and sautéed spinach. Thus I could comfortably indulge in what I still consider the BEST Banana Bread in Singapore. I love that they serve it warm with a thick butterscotch sauce, cool vanilla yogurt (also made from scratch by the chef, just like the Banana Bread itself), toasted nuts and freshly-grated orange zest. It is so scrumptious you\'re really missing out if you don\'t give it a try.

The table next door is having it\n<br />A brekkie plate all brightly lit.\n<br />The temptation starts from down below\n<br />And my hunger starts to grow.\n<br />\"Fuck this shit\", I say to myself, \n<br />All day breakfast here I come.\n<br />I flip the menu to Customised Brunch\n<br />And order my favourite bacon to munch.\n<br />The @thelokalsingapore does it really special, \n<br />Their bacon\'s super fried like the devil\n<br />Thin and crispy right off the plate\n<br />Perfect for that breakfast date.\n<br />Then I top it with the everyday classics,\n<br />Mushrooms, scrambled eggs and sourdough toast\n<br />(To be honest they were pretty ordinary, nothing to boast)\n<br />But wait, to give it that Lokal twist,\n<br />I add in some delicious smoked fish. \n<br />Oh my gawd, that smoked mackerel,\n<br />Soft and salty, all natural\n<br />That slab of buttery-soft, flaky heaven\n<br />Made my brekkie that much decadent.\n<br />So as you go about your dinner,\n<br />Contemplate this quiet winner.\n<br />Maybe tomorrow after your fine brekkie\n<br />You\'ll be sitting on the loo shitting coffee. 👍🏼 P.S Cause that\'s what happened to me after I ate so much. HAHAHAHA
Roasted kampong chicken (half; $26) that is moist &amp; soft, comes w mushroom, spinach &amp; served on a bed of delicious silky truffled mash potato. Crispy battered fish &amp; chips ($28) with a side of thick cut sweet potato fries. Dinner prices are a little steep with every main in the high $20s. Will come back for their lunch menu instead! 
Pickled beetroot, green beans, dried cranberries, quinoa, roasted pumpkin seeds &amp; whey dressing. Super yummy!! And portion is so hugeeee, it is a lot more filling than it looks, really. Love the crunch and the taste of the dressing. Will def come back to have this again! 😋
Very much different than the others, this F&amp;C is made up of red garoupa fritters which has a firm texture, chilli coriander mayonnaise and lime to spice and zest things up! I simply love their sweet potato fries! 😍 Too bad that it was a little too expensive for that portion. Will come back for their popular lobster roll and sticky date toffee pudding! 😁\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $50\n<br />————————————————————————
Lokal is my favorite to-go place for constantly good quality food &amp; coffee. One thing I love about Lokal is that they practically make everything in-house. Ketchup? *tick* Smoked Salmon? *tick* Butter? *tick*. I highly recommend trying out their Smoked Salmon/Mackerel which are smoked over apple chips. Don\'t be mistaken, It is different from your typical raw smoked salmon you get with your eggs Ben. This is perfectly \'cooked\' &amp; has a strong but not over-powering smokey flavor. 
First visit to The Lokal for dinner and many of their menu items were sold out 😫. So we had their Cape Grim Sirloin Tagliata ($28). Perfect for all steak-lovers, this juicy well done steak has cherry tomatoes, watercress and Asiago cheese, making it a well-balanced dish! 😋👍🏻\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $50\n<br />————————————————————————
Neil Road is bustling with trendy brunch restaurants, but The Lokal really made an impression on me.\n<br />With a ‘Pimp my breakfast’ option it offers the customer a unique experience to create their own breakfast. The options were varied and I was particularly enticed by the cauliflower cheese side dish which is a sure favourite for any UK locals like me.\n<br />I had the BLT which was well presented and tasted great but was let down by the lack of bacon (only 2 small rashers) which was swamped inside the big bun. What I enjoyed most about the menu was the choice of ingredients, drinks and dishes that were prepared in house, like a selection of sodas, the smoked salmon (amazing!)  And mackerel amongst other side dishes.\n<br />The highlight does seem to be the lobster sandwich which I wasn’t quite ready to consume at 11am but definitely willing to make a return trip to try.
They serve pretty decent food, will be back to try their dinner menu.
The pudding was served hot with a very addictive caramel sauce. A moist and airy cake that\'s topped with some sweet and sticky date paste, it was paired fittingly with a scoop of delicious vanilla bean ice cream which was its direct opposite, cold, smooth and not too sweet.

I can have this almost everyday! Who says healthy food can\'t be tasty?! This is both very healthy and very tasty. With that much of pickled cabbage with crunchy watercress, I was so satisfied that the warm pinkish roast beef was generously served almost as much. 😀 Grain mustard gave some savory taste and punch to every bite I took. Nice! 😉
The two small slipper lobster tails were laid gracefully on top of creamy coleslaw and gherkin. The prominent taste of gherkin might put some people off with its strong pickled taste but not me. I love how the gherkin mixed with coleslaw brings out the natural light sweetness of the succulent lobster. 😋 The lemon mayonnaise joined the party and added a refreshing sweet and citrus smell and taste. It also enhanced the entire flavour. And we were glad that they did a good job with the puffy and fluffy toast as it was lightly crisp and not soggy at all. Nonetheless, the greedy me hoped that there were more lobsters or bigger chunks of them to have a better bite because there were just too little lobster meat compared to everything else combined. 😁
Shiok bubbling sensation that sent shivers down our spines. We love the well-balanced sweet and sour tastes of these lovely drinks. 😚
This is my first time trying a lobster roll so I can\'t say how it compares to others. If you like subdued flavors, you will like this. The lobster tails were fresh, firm and nicely grilled. They were not drenched in sauce so you could taste their natural flavor. While they were not as juicy as I would have liked, they were not dry either. But if you like stronger tastes, this is kinda bland, with the strongest taste coming from the coleslaw in lemon mayo. Personally I like it but I won\'t rave about it. Side note: I was a little disappointed that curly fries was not available today, but the flat cut fries were delicious enough for me to get over my disappointment.

Used the #EntertainerApp for a 1-for-1 main, we had Lobster Roll $22 and French Toast $16. I enjoyed the toast, it was moist and fluffy while the lobster roll was kinda dry. 🤓
When they first started, it was on rye, but I guess it didn\'t sit with a lot of people, hence they changed it to wholemeal.
The need for a caffeine kick saw us back at The Lokal again. Seventh stop on Saturday to fuel ourselves before a night of drinks.\n<br />Maybe all this coffee keeps me thinking a little too much… Goodnight… or good morning if you\'re living on a different clock from me. 😑\n<br />#TheLokal #Affogato #Coffee *
Thank you for singing in dissonance in the restaurant 😂
The options on the menu for brunch/lunch on a weekday were limited but as i walked into the cafe, EVERY table has this on their table! Its either they are value for money or taste good or both! The curly fries are 👍! While the serving of the lobster roll were generous, but i just felt that something is missing! Its decent, but lack a wow factor! Guess, this is value for money! 
Everything is good but expensive (for such small portions) 😔 #howtonotbefat #Burpple
Today many cafes are still closed but this. The Lokal serving up good and quality brunch menu. Looking for a good hearty meal? This will be the place.
What is better than straight cut fries? I think the answer is well… curly fries!
As a chef, I works in cafes and restaurants. I know how things work with food and food cost. I was having my afternoon tea in The Lokal. And the staff is packing up the unsold muffins into several paper bags and start distributing to all the customers in the cafe for free. I was so impressed! Firstly, I know their muffins are freshly baked as they don\'t keep overnight which by right they could. Tell me honestly, how many cafes do keep muffins overnight for at least 1-2 days? And many companies does offer like 2 for the price of 1 or 50% off at a certain timing. Honestly speaking, the company is still gonna have profit even they sell it cheaper to u. But The Lokal went beyond all these factor to go all out to provide a service to their customers.
Cold brew. Enough said. #thelokal #burpple \n<br />I checked, they are closed on Mondays anyway. Haha. @_chloekay
Brilliant idea to spread the love for food either by words of mouth or social media, so you can key in \'snapandeatsg\' under promo code and enjoy 10% off with minimum spending of $50 at @thelokalsingapore.\n<br />Monday blue is approaching and I am craving for the Slipper Lobster Linguine ($26) infused in tomato shellfish sauce and basil. The delectable linguine was tossed with 2 pcs of slipper lobster and small chucks of plump and juicy lobster meat, bathed in a zesty sauce!
Warm and moist banana filling drizzled with yogurt and macadamia nuts. This was soooooo good 😋
Amazing French toast with candied bacon and apples, lobster roll with curly fries.
The venison was delectably juicy and well-cooked whilst the sweet celeriac puree, which coats your inner lips jealously and only betrays its green origins at the end of your mouthful, would give a potato first date quite the Shanghai Surprise. 3.9/5
Definitely one of my favourite cafes! Just look at the generous portion, one of the best lobster rolls I\'ve had at this price point! :) 
Love this! So moist, so fragrant, with a scoop of hokey pokey ice cream. Gets a bit sweet after a while from the ice cream though. If only I could bake like this. Priced at $10++. 
Read so many good reviews and boy, is this the best sticky date pudding I have ever had! Lovely rich caramel/toffee/nutty sauce to accompany the moist and decadent cake. Huge scoop of vanilla ice cream too! Must order when you come here! Priced at $10++.
The cake was moist and fluffy, and toasted warm which goes superbly well with the ice cream. The caramelised bananas gave it extra flavour and complimented the dish really well. A little on the sweet side, but this is dessert after all, not a salad. At $10, I would say it\'s quite a bang for your buck and a good way to round off your meal. 
Price:$10++. Verdict: yes, would be back again. Lokal is one of your typical cafes that has ridden on the recent cafe rage. But Lokal is unlike many of the cafes that have run-off-the-mill food items, subpar interior design and sometimes horrible service. The entire environment in Lokal is extremely comfortable. From the furniture (sofa with cushion pillows), to the warm and rustic interior design, to the proactive without being oppressive service, and finally to the really tasty dessert, this place really deserves a 2 thumbs up. Of the really tasty dessert, the one that really stood out is this sticky date pudding with vanilla ice cream. The pudding was appropriately sweet without being oppressively or overly so. The texture was also good. It was firm without being hard. This sticky date pudding has this irresistible charm that makes you want to dig your fork into it again and again. Make sure you do not forget your large scoop of ice cream on the side! Eat it together with your sticky date pudding! Would return to Lokal again when I am in the area!
Price: $10++. Verdict: ok ok. I\'ve previously made a review on Lokal\'s sticky date pudding where I\'ve raved it over and over. Sadly in this case, I am unable to say the same about the banana cake. This banana cake is admittedly good, but I just don\'t like it as much. I guess I would prefer for the interior of the banana cake to be slightly more moist. The one I had at Lokal was a little too dry for my taste.  
I changed the flavor of my ice cream. It is usually vanilla ice cream. I prefer to have this wonderful pudding with any kinds of chocolate ice cream.\n<br />However I wished the date pudding can be warmer.
.\n<br />Twister fries is a bonus.\n<br />.\n<br />Less that a month to make good use of entertainer 1-for-1 deals for the year of 2015. I still have a long wish list to accomplish!
:) For a start, i will be sharing some of my fave Singapore cafes!\n<br />•\n<br />The Lokal \n<br />My fave would be \"Pimp My Breakfast\" where you can customize your own brunch according to what you feel like having that day! \n<br />可以根据食量而决定要点什么，不必担心分量太多。还可以带着一本书哦！享用了brunch之后，边喝着他们家的咖啡边看书。😉
Woke up today craving The Lokal\'s \"Pimp My Breakfast\" so I made a beeline there. Really happy to find all my favourites, especially the roast chicken, taste as yummy as ever. And to also discover Chef Darren has introduced baked cauliflower with cheese as an option for pimping. What an awesome start to my day! 😄
Wonderful buttery creamy scrambled eggs, super crisp bacon, two slices of Pumpernickel and vanilla yoghurt. And the Aussie café-styled flat white could barely go wrong indeed. ♥
The Lokal Baked Eggs ($20) that comforting with pork sausage, baked beans topped with baked eggs. Interestingly once you dig deeper, you will realised all the spicy personality beneath. Not forgetting my usual order of their stellar Toasted Banana Bread ($14).
With homemade vanilla yogurt and toasted macadamia nuts, the banana bread can be eaten as a main or dessert for sharing (but I sort of guess you might not want to share it). The moist and warm banana filling with the yogurt makes a perfect pairing and eating it is so comforting. For a quick hangover cure, what better than the baked eggs which comes with an option of spicy beef or pork sausage, mushrooms, onion, baked beans, potato, bacon and two wonderfully eggs with runny yolks.
.\n<br />Lobster tails, gherkins, purple slaw and lemon mayonnaise between hotdog bun lips. It was evident that fine measures were taken to ensure the crucial balance between tangy brightness and creaminess of the entire mixture. So good... And let\'s not forget those curly fries.... I think I wiped off about half of my partner\'s plate.
Advocaat is definitely praise-worthy in bringing a simple soda to another new level with its rich creamy egg/custard-like flavour, reminding me of eggnog. A feminine drink? Well, arguably so, but undoubtedly a sweet note to end the night with.
Loving the cold brew here. Food is also made with simple ingredients yet flavourful. 
Was soo lucky to get my hands on this freshly baked tart. Don\'t get deceived by the dry-looking exterior because it hides a fudge-y chocolate goodness below. A scoop of ice cream would be the most ideal pairing!
|\n<br />Laid on a bed of mashed potato. I could just use the spoon to scope and eat. Everything just melted in the mouth. The crispy belly was just a surplus (which could be ignore).
|\n<br />Whole piece of lobster (not those shredded bites). The shell was used in the broth and then absorbed by the linguine. Every mouthful was exploded with the freshness. Totally a 5 stars dish!
|\n<br />Least amount of gamy taste but maximum flavor. The chicken liver parfait tasted like high end butter with a more savor touch. The caramelized onion and pickled veg balanced the strong chicken liver. Too good!
|\n<br />Crispy on the outside, fluffy in the inside. Totally my kind of thing!!
|\n<br />Different texture of cauliflower could be found in one dish. The ricotta gave a creaminess to them like having butter on a toast. Healthy and Tasty starter
Cafe-date with @janicehelloo brought us to The Lokal! Heard alot about the hearty and quality dishes from this Aussie cafe. Love customisable menus so glad there\'s the Pimp My Breakfast option: Smoked mackerel (+$6), scrambled eggs (+$5) and sourdough toast (+$1.75). The mackerel was an interesting choice but I would prefer my usual smoked salmon over this. Also loved the generous portion of buttery scrambled eggs! Lovely, quiet ambience on a relaxed weekday and the free wifi is always a plus! 😁
Pimp Your Breakfast choices: Roasted Pumpkin ($6), Wilted Spinach ($4) and Sautéed Mushrooms ($5). 2 slices of Toast ($1.75), Scrambled Eggs ($5) and Smoked Mackerel ($6). Pretty value for money, considering the hearty portions. It\'s quite popular, as we saw a full house on a weekday, albeit we did go during lunch hours, so it may not be the most conducive place if you\'re planning to stay for a longer time.
With the Entertainer App 1 for 1 deal ($22 ala carte), I am more willing to spend on a lobster roll for lunch, but it was incredibly awesome. The lobster meat was so bouncy and perhaps not many people would understand, but the sauce was sour and full of my favourite pickles!!!
After the facial session, another cup of coffee. But this time round, at one of my favorite cafes - @thelokalsingapore. Not only that they serve awesome coffee... But food as well. They are just few doors away from @thepopuluscafe (in my previous 2nd post)... #Cafehopping made easy! 😉😜
Roast beef with roast pumpkin, poached eggs and pumpernickel bread. Loved the caramelised onions that came with the beef! 
Having been here thrice, their Pimp My Breakfast will definitely make you fall on your knees and ask for more. The portion was huge and generous and the winning point is almost everything there is home-made (I don\'t even know what\'s not), from butter to sausages, bread (from Nick Vina) to pickles. Sitting on the kitchen counter, le bf and I witnessed everything being skilfully prepared from scratch, boasting the idea of made-to-order. Their service has been consistently top-notch, no question asked. As we enjoyed our food and discussed about their other dishes on the chalkboard, Chef Darren Farr passed us a scoop of their home-made kaya. We looked at each other after the first try with our eyes almost popped out. Yes, it\'s that good. Very unique rendition of kaya, with a thick jam-like texture, and it\'s exceptionally tasty. My dish itself was wonderful as usual. Those slices of pumpernickel was toasted to perfection, neither soggy nor too crunchy. Sautéed mushroom was nothing less than impeccable. Chewy and tasty, but not overwhelming. Avocado was good but nothing so special. Perhaps, sprinkling some pink himalayan salt and black pepper (which are available at the kitchen counter) will help to elevate the taste. That aside, the dish was as satisfying as ever.
Yummy lobster rolls at only $11 each with the Entertainer app :)
One of them is Pork Ribs… loved the accompanying \"Rojak\"on the side of this dish! Cravings…
Back to pimp my breakfast! Spinach today wasn\'t as good but masterchef of LoKal sent a complimentary sticky date pudding which was out of this world and better than my all time fave from Prive 
$16 worth of bread drenched in sauce and drowning under the heap of apples, raisins, bacon and cream, this is hands down one of the yummiest toast ever!!! The signature $14 banana bread did not disappoint mm perfect citrus sauce to balance out the sweet fluffy bread. 
delicious. need to be consumed fast as it will not be as nice when it\'s cold. $12. a lil too much for 2 person. probably a 4 pax side dish for sharing.
naturally seafood flavoured soup, with fleshy prawns and squid. felt that the bread can be omitted though. can taste the freshness of the ingredients !
Ordered the Slipper Lobster Linguine ($26) &amp; the Cape Grim Sirloin Tagliata ($28)! The linguine was pretty good, just to note that the fan above us blew the dish cold faster than expected. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great too! 
Just go try it. You wouldn\'t regret.\n<br />1. Sticky date pudding with vanilla ice cream\n<br />Served warm, sticky with generous pool of caramel goodness. Cake is a perfect match with the ice cream.\n<br />2. Banana chocolate cake with yet again vanilla ice cream\n<br />I am not a fan of banana dessert but I had to say I go back to this every time. (Cause my workplace is nearby)\n<br />Always feel so sinful after these but heck, I need such foodie in my tummy.
Some cafes/restaurants don\'t realise how important the quality of ice-cream can make or break a dessert. At The Lokal, I\'m happy that their vanilla ice-cream is on point. You can tell if vanilla ice-cream is the legit when you see specks of vanilla bean throughout the scoop. Together with the copious amount of caramel sauce, they make the sticky date pudding ($10++) a euphoric treat for anyone.
The bun is a little thick for the lobster roll and it is a tad too sour because of the lemon mayonnaise, but I love the addition of gherkin and coleslaw that provided a refreshing and crunchy texture to it. Still, it is a good lobster roll and one of the inexpensive lobster roll around.
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Café Hopping
Had the customized \"Pimp Your Breakfast\" set, which has an array of selections for you to choose from. But 6 bucks for shredded chicken is kinda expensive I have to say. I think the quality of food here is not too bad but I wouldn\'t go all out of my way for this.. 
Moist and sufficiently dense, the hot sticky date pudding was perfectly balanced by the cold vanilla bean ice cream, soaking in the oh-so-heavenly sticky toffee sauce.
Slipper Lobster Tails, Gherkin, Coleslaw &amp; Lemon Mayo with side of Twister Fries. Perhaps the best value-for-money Lobster Roll in town at $22++ (even better value if you have The Entertainer which gives you a 2-for-1 deal) for it is pretty satisfying and filling. At its price point, the amount of lobster meat is pretty reasonable; considerably chunky and definitely fresh, while the coleslaw within fills up most of the roll. Wasn\'t particularly a fan of the lemon mayo but it\'s there to kill off the ocean-y flavours of the lobster if any, but it\'s most probably something that only applies to my tastebuds. Bread was buttered and grilled; could have been fluffier but still decent and the twister fries are done the way the locals love, and better than any fast food restaurant that attempts to serve them. Something to try at least once, and makes for a good virgin experience for lobster rolls for its lower price point to see if you actually want to go for other pricier options around.
Lovely Saturday afternoon having my favourite kind of brunch. Going straight for The Lokal\'s \'Pimp Your Breakfast\' section, I really like the idea of customizing my own breakfast which is some what similar to that offered at the Ronin Cafe with their Scrambled Eggs on Toast. I ordered the scrambled eggs (good texture), two slices of toast, smoked salmon and sauteed mushrooms (well-seasoned) where as my friend had the roast beef for her protein which was also really delish. A really satisfying brunch indeed!
Good but not great. The quality of the lobster was mediocre and the fillings were coleslaw more than anything else. 
Cauliflowers presented three ways; fried, mashed and boiled, sharing the limelight with the walnuts, greens and cottage cheese. Fried ones were crispy and crunchy, while the mash was delightfully light. The boiled ones were seemingly pickled and gave the cauliflowers a different sort of flavour. Cottage cheese was a good addition as the light cheesiness did not overwhelm the flavours of the mash, while the walnuts added a crunch to the smooth, creamy texture of the mash.
This hot sticky date pudding is very good on its own that has the right balance of moist and density, with the right amount of sweetness of sticky toffee sauce to soak in to each bite. Totally love the combination of hot pudding and sauce against the cold vanilla bean ice cream that is paired together for an indulgent treat! My life is completed now! 😁😁😁
This is the second time that I\'ve come here and it\'s specially for the banana bread, which was, as expected, a marvellous dish. So fluffy was the bread that it made me squeal with my first bite. The bread is speckled generously with walnuts and the tart homemade yoghurt just elevates it to new culinary heights.
Suffering withdrawal symptoms of not having this for too long.
Pimped my breakfast with 4 slices of sourdough with homemade butter, 2 poached eggs and sautéed potatoes. Yummy! But gym tomorrow, I must. #thelokalsingapore @ Neil Road📍 #eatdrinklokal\n<br />••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n<br />☞Free Wifi☜ 🚇Nearest Station: Outram Park, Exit H

That\'s a key marker of a good Flat White. Contrary to popular belief, a Flat White isn\'t just a smaller Latte/a Latte with a higher coffee to milk ratio. The key difference is the milk: a Flat White has the smooth mix of velvet microfoam, stiff froth, and milk all expertly swirled into the espresso without destroying the sweet crema; a latte on the other hand is a milky coffee with a little foam.
We\'re 50 and its a celebration! \n<br />Happy bdae Singapore! \n<br />#NDP #SG50 #singapore
🍅🌿🍳🍄🍴 Scrambled eggs / sautéed potatoes / sautéed mushrooms / wilted spinach / grilled tomato ❤️ #thelokal #pimpyourbreakfast
An interesting \"hipster\" rendition of our local favourite breakfast that features in-house made condiments; the Kaya and the Butter are both homemade here at The Lokal. Kaya had a pretty strong coconut flavour running through, while the smooth butter had an aftertaste I wasn\'t particularly fond of. A runny egg comes at the side, which you can dip your toast in if you fancy, or if you are like me; eat it separately.
Perfectly timed for SG50 is The Lokal\'s sexy take on our local kaya toast and egg set. Served slightly chilled, their housemade kaya is a luxury for the senses with its stylish presentation, amazing coconut fragrance and smooth, rich texture. Slather it on thick on the toasted pan de mie bread, add a swipe of butter (also made in-house) and dip it in the sous vide egg for an unforgettable gastronomic experience. 
Smoked mackerel on rye, with pickled onion and labneh ($16.90). Simply love their house-smoked fish here. You\'ll never know that mackerel could taste this way, especially after years of eating it Japanese Saba style. This lovely open-faced sandwich was one of their brunch specials today! 
$4.90, house made Kaya and butter, with lightly toasted pain de mie. The Kaya is very very very coconut-ty, come try it if coconut is your jam (heh, gettit?)! A light and refined take on Kaya toast, a tiny bit pricey but understandably so, and very nice with a cold brew. 
Early start to the day.
This was a dream come true breakfast. My friend and I had the Pimp My Breakfast option where we could customize our breakfast from an assortment of sides. 
Loveeee how fluffy the toast was! And the caramelised apple, and the crispy bacon, and the maple syrup. Okay, basically everything was flawless!
This heavenly dessert currently tops my \"Favourite Dessert\" list. It is indeed such an addictive combination of cold yet melting vanilla ice cream with warm moist sticky date pudding that every bite will make you cry in joy and ask for more. Definitely not to be missed during a visit to The Lokal!
When choosing for a cafe to hop to, I am more interested in the food than the ambience. Before that, I will always recommend RONIN Cafe to my friends for the scrambled eggs and WICKED coffee. Now, I can finally add The LoKal to my recommended list of cafes for serving excellent food. I have long wanted to try The LoKal and finally got the opportunity to drop them a visit for brunch on a lovely Saturday. My mind was set upon looking at the weekend brunch menu and my eyes zoomed straight at the Pimp My Breakfast section. Choosing two slices of bread ($1.50), scrambled eggs ($5), sautéed potatoes ($5) and smoked mackerel on cherry woodchips ($6), my hearty brunch came up to $17.50, the usual price nowadays but the food served here is so much better than the rest. I foresee more visits to The LoKal in the near future.
Many have raved about the Sticky Date Pudding at The LoKal and I fully agree to all the compliments heaped on it. Another one of their outstanding dishes that deserves a spot in the limelight is the Toasted Banana Bread ($12). How can anyone resist a loaf of moist banana bread with homemade vanilla yogurt, toasted macadamias and caramelized bananas. The long list of ingredients is already making my mouth water. It\'s like having a party in your mouth when you take the first bite of all the elements that make up this dish. Also, I am just as clueless as to why it took me so long to make my first visit to The LoKal. Guess good things are worth the wait and this wait is well worth it. 
A little too much bread for my liking, but the lobster was present and friendly at this party instead of being all standoffish and only sociable with people whom it can manipulate and exploit. The lemon mayonnaise and other elements kept their respective distance, allowing the lobster’s natural charms and refreshing realness to come through and speak for itself. 3.8/5 
So much love for this! This is dessert done right. The outside of the pudding was slightly caramelised and crispy, while the inside was incredibly moist and soft. It was served hot, so it was super satisfying to eat it with the cold vanilla ice cream. Unlike normal caramel-based desserts, this didn\'t have the sickly sweet taste, and you could taste the flavour of the dates. At only $10 a pop, I would say this is so worth it. 
// Can see cannot eat: Slipper Lobster Linguine 🍝. On a scale of very good to very very good, goddaughter said it was \"very very very very good\" HAHA. Had a gigantic root beer float too 😌🍺🍦

Moist, light, sweet and oh-so-sinful, this has become my weekly pick-me-up. A must-have to anyone visiting The Lokal.
It\'s the first time I\'ve strayed from my fave Pimp Your Breakfast option, and I\'m not regretting my choice at all. Well-toasted fresh ciabatta, generous slices of tender roast beef, sweet caramelized onions, all rounded up with spicy wholegrain mustard. It\'s absolutely delicious.
multiple juicy slices of tender, flavourful roast beef grilled with soft onions... tangy coleslaw... fresh crunchy watercress... all piled on to a pillow of soft bread that\'s been slathered with housemade butter and grain mustard... Nope, there\'s absolutely nothing I can fault about this here sandwich. So please excuse me while I stuff my face 😋😋😁\n<br />#veronicaphuaeats #burpple #thelokalsg #thelokal #roastbeef #sandwich #sgfood #sgeats #eatoutsg #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #cafesg #sgcafe #whati8today #8DaysEat #openricesg #hungrygowhere #burppletastemaker
I had a sampling of it and absolutely loved it. Positively ambrosial with an alluring fragrance, Chef Darren\'s delicious concoction is ultra smooth and luxuriant in texture. It\'s the result of a painstaking process that begins with coconut milk being infused with pandan leaves before it\'s cooked sous vide style together with egg yolks and gula malaka. Right now, the Kaya which is served as a set with cold curls of butter (also made in-house), warm toast and a slow-cooked egg, is available when Chef Darren has time to make it. Come August, however, it will be a permanent item on the menu. Yay! #veronicaphuaeats #thelokal #thelokalsg #kaya #burpple #sgcafe #cafesg #instafoodsg #whati8today #sgfoodies #eatoutsg #sgfood #burppletastemaker

My choice are sautéed potatoes, mushroom and super crispy bacon.
I have always adored The Lokal for their awesome Australian style brunch dishes that exemplify freshness and quality. Well, after my visit last night, I can tell you they are just as impressive when it comes to dinner. Their evening menu is completely different from the day one, and I notice the service complements it by taking on a more formal air too. Here\'s a selection of what we had, pictured clockwise from top left...
Bursting with flavour and fantastically juicy everywhere, this is a must-try. I don\'t know how the chef does it but even the breast meat is like juice central! Each serving gets you half a roasted chicken with gravy, wilted spinach and TRUFFLED mash. Yes, their super-smooth mashed potato is laced with plenty of truffle oil. Mind-blowing stuff.
This was loved by everyone at the table. The beautiful pale asparagus were incredibly smooth and tender with no fibrousness at all. They rested in a pool of rich, warm brown butter sauce, and were lavished with toasted hazelnuts, crispy housemade bacon and a perfectly poached egg. The combined result had us abandoning conversation to focus on enjoying it. 
How\'s that for breakfast?
Pudding is on the dryer side, toffee sauce was too thick 
The steamed cake game is yay strong. Slightly crisp, sticky, and caramelised exterior, crumbling into the softest, moistest cake. A dab of the ice cold vanilla bean ice cream, a spoonful of the piping hot cake - decadence at it\'s ultimate. Only peeve is the toffee sauce is really inconsistent. But that aside, still my fave.
(๑¯◡¯๑) French Toast with sautéed apples, raisins, house cured bacon and maple cream. A little too sweet, but love the cream, apples and bacon—although I prefer candied bacon, but these were crisp and still as addictive.
I don\'t usually use such a strong word, but after 4 repeated visits this month I think The Lokal deserves this title. I love everything on the Pimp Your Breakfast list, the gorgeous and stunning Sticky Date Pudding, and - I\'m just gonna stop here cause I love everything I\'ve tried there.

To the best toasted banana cake with the homemade yogurt sauce and caramelised banana - everything just blend in perfectly! I can easily finished it all by myself! What\'s more can I say? 😋
Fragrant peanut butter--made in-house that\'s an unexpected but gorgeous deep brown hue--buries a giant scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Along then comes a pair of large crunchy biscotti pieces. And finally, the toasted nuts who always insist on arriving fashionably late to a party. #snickers #thelokal #thelokalsg #sgcafe #cafehoppingsg #cafesg #instafoodsg #foodgram #desserts #foodporn #eatoutsg #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker
On certain Sundays, the chef-owner rolls out something extra special (follow @thelokalsingapore on Instagram to be kept updated). What stole our hearts today was this perfectly cooked roast beef with its extreme juiciness and buttery texture. The accompanying housemade light, fluffy Yorkshire pudding did the best job of soaking up the equally yummy gravy. This is one dish worth checking out if you adore your red meat.
Mmmmm~ Warm caramelized bananas, ice cream and a hearty piece of banana cake with a strong fragrance of cinnamon in every bite; together with a cup of coffee, tea or (my favourite) hot chocolate will make anyone\'s afternoon complete!

We had bangers &amp; mash with onion jam. The dish had great textures from the chewy crunch of the sausages to the soft but thick mashed potatoes. We can tell they put great pride in their food as they don\'t serve chili sauce and ketchup but chili and ketchup jams! After eating, we prepared for the afternoon with wonderful coffee.
This is undoubtedly one of the best sticky date puddings I\'ve had. Shockingly hot and moist pudding, perfectly caramelised on the outside, doused in a sticky toffee sauce. The earthy dates were very pronounced here, each forkful revealing clumps of the stringy fruit. Paired with the cold vanilla bean ice cream, this made the perfect ending to our Sunday brunch. 
I have looked high and low but hand on my heart, the banana bread at The Lokal is still my number one. Mostly because it\'s served warm and blanketed in their luscious housemade vanilla yogurt. Of course the cooked banana pieces, caramel sauce and toasted hazel nuts don\'t hurt 😄
Basically, this is an awesome BLT with a twist. Firstly, The Lokal uses really light, fluffy charcoal buns instead of regular sliced bread. Then there\'s the killer combo of crispy bacon (made from scratch in-house mind you), fresh lettuce, tomato, a lightly fried egg and tomato sauce (although calling it \"tomato sauce\" doesn\'t do this tangy relish/sauce any justice).\n<br />Priceless moment: When I picked up The Black Pearl to take my first bite and the light pressure of my fingers caused the egg to burst, creating a cascade of golden yolk! 😍\n
Being able to pick what I want is fun and enjoyable. \n<br />Never have I ever seen smoked salmon served as a chunk! It was delectable.\n<br />Monster wants to brunch again!\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
What\'s drawing me there??! Haha!
The sweet and slightly spicy watercress bought out the beefy-ness and created the perfect balance. Even though the beef was lean, there was no struggling between my teeth and the sandwich. Really good work! .\n<br />|\n<br />(Why you don\'t just sit straight like the rest?)
Choose your eggs, bread , many more you wish to have on your breakfast. I love thier hot chocolate 🍫 latte!
Always happy to have a simple bowl of granola for brunch or at any time of the day. #TheLokal
Headed to The Lokal to try out their dinner menu, which didnt disappoint. We had the Sirlion Tagliata, which was very tender,juicy and tasty and the Slippery Lobster Linguine, which tasted exactly like my all time favourite Lobster Bisque! 
Essentially how it would taste if a bajillion clams were strapped to life essence extraction machines and all their flavour distilled into a small pool on your plate. The stew itself was supremely thick and flavourful – you could use it as dip for the bread, spoon it as a soup, or enjoy the soaked seafood and how the stew enriches the flavour of their succulent little bodies. I was pretty gobsmacked by how much seafood there was, and I managed to fill myself up nicely for dinner despite the only “main” carb present being the barley-esque fregola sarda pasta. 4.2/5 
The magic of this very traditional style of carbonara lies in how that half-cooked egg binds everything together in golden glory. With soft bacon (they make their own in-house), almost invisible onions, stealth garlic, olive oil and white wine, the result is positively ambrosial 😍\n<br />The catch is they don\'t always have this. Are you feeling lucky yet? 😜\n
This dish was so, so good!! The stock they use is shellfish bisque – it has that smoky, roasted quality mingled with the brininess of the sea. And the cook on that slipper lobster, they absolutely nailed.
I am so hungry now omg somebody FEEEEEEEED MEEEEEEE.
The Lokal\'s lobster roll is easily one of the least expensive ones around, so please come with expectations managed. It features slipper lobster tails tossed in a lemon mayo dressing. Every bite is refreshingly piquant and crunchy, thanks to the addition of chopped gherkins and housemade coleslaw. I loved the toasted buns - the melted butter in there was so darn good, plus it helped to balance the tart flavours nicely.
The highlight though was I finally had the pleasure of shaking the hand of @fuzzychef the man behind it all. Thank you again for the sticky date pudding 😊\n<br />Awesome latte as always @zenzxnny 👍\n<br />#thelokalsg #thelokal #cafesg #sgcafe #burpple
I love places where they made and served their own cakes. Few weeks ago, I had their raspberry chocolate cake! The balance between sweet and sour! Definitely going back this place for their dinner!
Spent quite a lot of time here in this cafe! The dessert is nice and the coffee is good! However, the place can be rather noisy when there is a crowd! 
#StickyPudding and #IceCream from #TheLokal at Neil road. \n<br />It\'s really sweet but we can\'t stop eating it!! Yumms \n<br />Like us on our Facebook page for more #foodpornasia! Link on our bio ;)\n<br />#foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia
Brunch with @fe3k and @sinarhx3 ! #frenchtoast with caramelized apple and Crispy bacon! Rewarding to wake up early and head down for some awesome #brunch and catch up withthe bmtbuddies ^^! 6 more months!!! Getting there~ #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodgasm #foodporn
Well you get to choose whatever you like, so I got scrambled eggs, wilted spinach, roasted chicken (a little salty on its own but definitely tender) &amp; sautéed mushroom. 
This was so darn good. Sweetness from the banana bread &amp; caramelised banana, the yoghurt, crunchy macadamia nuts - so great together! 
Great home-made ice tea and you can choose How you Want your eggs to be and be With ;)
Looking at the intense looks on the face of the chefs. The aroma of the food whilst cooking... Mmmhmm, voila.
Banana bread with yoghurt, caramelised banana, maple syrup and toasted macadamia nuts. More of a soury, sweet dessert to me 😊
the lokal lobster roll &amp; banana bread &amp; latte.
Huge chunky meat, but we can\'t decide whether it was really lobster or crayfish. But serving was generous for $22 with the lightly toasted bun and coleslaw.
The Lokal probably needs no introduction, and it certainly deserves to be re-visited, time and time again. There aren\'t many places where you can \"pimp your breakfast\" quite so well, and in such a lovely space. While there are many items to choose from, don\'t hesitate to include their scrambled eggs ($5), delectable house-smoked salmon($6), sauteed mushrooms ($4) and always, always add ricotta ($5). Desserts and coffee are certainly their strong points, so don\'t leave without trying either the French Toast ($15) with sauteed apple, house-cured bacon, and maple cream (a true contender to Ronin\'s similar rendition), or their Toasted Banana Bread ($12) with vanilla yoghurt and caramelized bananas.
the banana loaf this time round was too dry :( mocha was good tho 
4 munchies: Smooth and creamy hokey pokey ice cream with banana cake and caramelised bananas. The banana cake was rich and moist, which could be eaten on its own. It’d be a really great dessert if there were another element to balance the sweetness.
Cinnamon biscuit, grounded nuts, chocolate peanut butter and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The a pinch of sea salt balanced the dessert! Very well done!!! .\n<br />|\n<br />Hand credit: @eileenongxt
Got things going on the second day of Chinese New Year with a filling and delicious brunch at The Lokal, one of the few cafes open during the festive period. From the selection available for \"pimping\" your breakfast, I chose scrambled eggs, avocado, roast chicken and sourdough toast. I was pleased with everything; the roast chicken especially. It\'s the same one they use in their fabulous chicken ciabatta sandwiches, which means the meat is superbly moist and full of flavour. 
2.5 munchies: The poached eggs were slightly overdone, smoked salmon and sautéed mushrooms lacked seasoning, and grilled sausage needed more savour. I\'d recommend only drinks and desserts.
What can I say apart from this being close to life-saving! The coffee-lovers out there can attest to what I\'m feeling 😄
Today\'s long black is a double score, so much nicer than usual!!maybe because of my long caffeine break.. HAPPY 大年初二 everyone!! #cny2015sg
(They even open during CNY period) .\n<br />|\n<br />Pump my breakfast \n<br />1. Smoked Mackerel (in house smoked)\n<br />2. Sautéed Mushroom \n<br />3. Scrambled Egg \n<br />4. Toast\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />I really love their smoked mackerel but for those who can\'t stand any fishy smell, you can alway choose smoked salmon.
This CNY period might be the best time to score a table at this ever-popular cafe. Pimp your breakfast, and be sure to get their house-smoked salmon! Don\'t leave without trying a dessert too.
A light and yummy drink of mixed berries and house-made honey vanilla yogurt. Worth a try if you want to have something fresh. 
I tasted this banana bread from the blue mountain once. It was the best ever! Regretted ordering this because I was kinda hopeful to taste the same bread again. Haha! This banana bread has a very strong cinnamon taste to it. Serve with caramelized banana and vanilla yogurt. And with grated lime and orange zest. I should have ordered French toast instead..
My first attempt on The Lokal\'s breakfast plate despite my many visits there. It\'s a mix-and-match of various ingredients you would fancy eating for breakfast, and we chose Scrambled Eggs, Sautéed Mushrooms and Smoked Salmon. The house-cured Smoked Salmon was pretty unlike the ones we get at other cafés; usually pre-packaged, thinly sliced in dainty portions. This one came in a slab, and was not only fresh but thoroughly cured so you could taste the smoked flavour of cherrywood chips used to smoke the salmon; pretty impressive. Sautéed Mushrooms were a nice bite and juicy, bursting with its earthy flavour while the scrambled eggs were one of the creamiest yet eggy and flavourful ones that I ever tried. Definitely fit for those looking for some solid and satisfying meal to start the day with.
First time having The Lokal\'s Cold Brew and I am impressed; the body is sufficiently fruity and earthy yet does not cause much aftertaste. Enjoyed this even till the last drop!
☕️: The Lokal \n<br />x\n<br />📈: 3.5/5
Supposed to meet her in taiwan but she flew back early. Ohwell 😂😂😂
Back in Singapore and decided to visit The Lokal again :) hope everyone\'s having a good Sunday!
So disappointing. The first time The Lokal has disappointed. There is another ingredient which I\'ve forgotten. It\'s just to weird and the texture becomes too moist.
It is as if the bread doesn\'t have enough bananas in it, they just had to put more caramelized ones by the side. Good lord. This one was ordered based on my colleague\'s recommendation. Costed $12 for the banana bread and extra $1.20 for hokey pokey ice cream you CANNOT miss out on!
@brighterstar39 and me loh!Just kidding..getting some work done here. 😅😅 Good morning!!
Dense but moist warm banana cake with caramelized banana slices and a scoop of Hokey Pokey ice cream. So yummyyy!!
High on the possibilities list is the French Toast with Apple and Bacon from The Lokal, a joint that ranked very highly on the Burpple Hot 100 of 2014. #BurppleTastemaker Alain Foodology deems the French Toast, which is served with caramelized apples and crispy bacon, a perfect marriage of sweet and savory! #Burpple
you don\'t want to know exactly what\'s in it but it blew my mind away. \n<br />@fuzzychef clever use of the pig which tasted extraordinary. a blast of flavors when you spread some of it on a piece of bread and into your mouth. exciting! I only had half because @dawnmusk ate the other 1.5. 😒
Have a great week ahead, peeps!
The French toast was a gift from heaven - warm, fat and fluffy, like a Japanese Spitz puppy. The apple maintained its integrity well, being warm, crunchy, intensely sweet and just a tad sour. The bacon was so thin, salty and crispy it was like a cracker! It was a fantastic brunch experience. 4.1/5 
One simply cannot leave the Lokal with trying this! Their sticky date pudding with their hocky pocky ice cream! The pudding and the ice cream are of extreme temperature placed in the same plate and bringing the best out of them!
With tomato shellfish sauce and basil. Mediocre dish as compared to the rest. But linguine was al dante and lobster was bouncy and fresh!
Thought it was a soup/chowder kind of dish but it surprised me as a pasta dish, in a good way. Melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked wagyu beef cubes, freshly made spaerzle and that white scoop of créme fraiche, goes really well together.
Pardon me, but i really cannot remember. Especially when the Lokal changes their menu all the time.... you really don\'t know what you\'ll get when you head there for their dinner menu! Kudos to that!
The terrine of a pig\'s head.... sounds really exotic, but taste really good on top of toast and pickled cucumber and their interesting mustard sauce.
De\"light\"ful option. A nice change from the usual chicken ciabatta. Counting the number of types of chopped fruits in the salad, there are at least 10: watermelon, honeydew, pineapple, mango, blueberry, kiwi, dragonfruit, cranberry, goji berry and raisin!
Scrambled eggs, sautéed mushrooms, sourdough, ricotta, smoked salmon, smoked makeral. All make from scratch.\n<br />French toast with pear, cured bacon... Heavenly... @limmeted will agree #burpple
Oh gawd, is this goooooooood 😵😵😵. That slightly crusty banana cake with a moist, dense crumb, its fragrance echoed by accompanying chunks of ripe banana sticky with caramel; with a finishing touch in the form of hokey pokey ice cream (vanilla ice cream with studs of honeycomb toffee), I can\'t think of any way in which this dessert can be made any better.
Can\'t beat the taste of sweet caramelised bananas with moist, dense cake and ice cream reminding me of violet crumble once again. Happy Weekend everyone!
Banana bread was yummy like always and the roast beef ciabatta was not bad as well! Could do with a little more seasoning and sauce but the caramelized onions were delicious mmmm 
First time had my American breakfast that I could customized to what I love to eat, there\'s many choices to pimp your breakfast. Most of their food are homemade such as their butter which will cost you $1. Their bacon is superb, should try.
About how we only get one life\n<br />Woke me up right after two. Stayed awake and stared at you. So I wouldn\'t lose my mind.
Black Pearl Breakfast BLT: charcoal and squid ink burger bun, with bacon, fried egg, tomato, lettuce and ketchup ($16). Not really impressive, and I don\'t get squid ink and charcoal items because I really can\'t taste the difference at all. You should probably stick to their favorites!
Just few minutes walk from Outram Park station, this cafe delivers stable and fast wifi that most Malaysian nomads like me would crave for! However power sockets are somewhat limited. Thatta said, it still scores 4/5 for Digital Nomad friendly rating!
French toast ($15) from #thelokal, ermahgadddd. 😍 Don\'t get me started on the sticky date pudding.
The best \"cold\" sandwich. Bring it on, anytime. Love their shredded chicken thigh and bacon served cold which exudes even more the roasted flavors. Together with rich &amp; riped avocado, crisp lettuce, sliced tomato and complete with a home made butter mayo (ok I am still figuring out) dressing, the (signature sarnies-style) ciabatta sandwich is too good to think of alternatives.
The ricotta is an excellent compliment to the same delicious roasted chicken (thigh meat better) used in their roast chicken ciabatta (except it\'s served warm); and the egg scrambled eggs.
So legendary that almost everyone that had been here had said at least something about it. I just can\'t stop myself from raving about any dish that they serve here; warm jiggly sticky date pudding that was fibrous with their signature Hokey-Pokey Ice-Cream doused in caramel. So glad I am finally having it after my fifth visit here; was so good I think I died once, came back and left my soul there!
The coffee here has always been good but I had been on a mood for tea lately. This one was really refreshing; you can actually taste that lemon zestiness but it hardly bites the throat, and well supplemented with the minty coolness that comes after. So refreshing on a hot day!
I can eat this the whole of Christmas. Generous sliced banana and walnut fillings.
The pasta of the day was a summery courgette+eggplant conchiglie and we pimped our plates with The Lokal\'s signature smoked mackerel and salmon, scrambled eggs and sundried tomatoes. YUM.
Food is filling and yummy. Everyone enjoyed their mains with the only complain being the pasta being a little too salty! A place that doesn\'t disappoint. The pear cider was light and refreshing too. 
They open at 8am weekdays 9am weekends. And accept entertainer app for 2015 (1 for 1 main including brek plates). I prefer however to trick out my own brek from the Pimp List. Breads at $1.50 for 2 slices, generous scoop of smashed avocado $5, house hot smoked mackerel $5, house cured very crispy bacon at $6... Wifi free password ilovebacon. White coffees $5.
Finally got to try what I have seen on Burpple/Instagram for so long but hadn\'t got a chance to taste for myself! Love how the egg batter was well-absorbed in the toast all the way, making the toast soft, fluffy with eggy and vanilla flavours. Enhancing its sweetness is the generous amount of syrup, spiked with light maple cream as it melts into the syrup over the time. Bacon was crispy, but adds a savoury touch with the poached apples giving it a sweet yet tart tastes.
This was hard and tasted burnt 😐 no amount of poached fruit and homemade yogurt could save it.
a mix of sweet and savory. some carbs, some meat, mostly sugar. those slices of crisp bacons, the pan fried toast, a scoop of vanilla and peach slices, topped off with a generous drizzle of that sweetish slime. tried this yet ?
free range chicken from Malaysia made to such a juicy and tender tasting dish. even the breast meat wasn\'t tough. how not to like? \n<br />other lokal\'s dinner menu on my new blog post 👆👆👆
Lamb shoulders(think well-marbled fats) were brined in spices and coffee, and then slow-roasted in the oven with some dry rub. My friend who does not usually eat lamb, gave his stamp of approval. The three of us concluded that this was the BEST dish of the night. \n<br />Make a trip to @thelokalsingapore for your dinner plans tonight!Dinner menu would be served every Tuesday to Saturday ONLY, from 5.30pm onwards.(last order 10.30pm).
(would be priced approximately between $26-$30.)\n<br />Top left - Wagyu beef goulash.\n<br />Top right - 1/2 Kampong chicken.\n<br />Bottom - Slow roasted lamb shoulder.
Top left - Beetroot cured Norwegian Salmon.\n<br />Top right - Parfait of chicken liver.\n<br />Bottom - Seared Wagyu beef carpaccio.
mixed with green apples, cucumber and sweet potato chips. (a preview of da lokal\'s menu which will start on 11.11 😋)
I see myself having one lol 😳 Anyway, here\'s one of my fav spot for caffeine and desserts ☕️
This is going to be good! Also, do check out the latest adventure at Club Meatballs, which is open from 5pm till late. Lunches will probably begin in early December.
That\'s a whole lotta fish on a plate! There\'s a small price to pay for all the omega-3 goodness though - the fish oil sisters are kinda clingy and possessive with your mouth, lingering way past the meal. 3.75/5
Delightful moist and tender crumbs. 😍😍I\'m always blessed by the generosity of Chef Darren!Thank you @fuzzychef ! 😉😉
A tropical pineapple upside-down cake is just not fun without the hokey pokey ice cream. The pineapple upside-down cake at The Lokal is intensely flavored and moist, sweet but not cloying. 
I\'m a sucker for banana breads. The bread itself was really nicely made, not too sweet - moist with a crumbly crust. However, the yoghurt had an overpowering sour lemon zest flavour which unfortunately spoilt the overall dish. The dishes were quite overprice for fairly ordinary breakfast dishes. My first and last visit to The Lokal.
Completely different texture from the regular muffin. Love their generous cream cheese, not only for that huge cube baked on the top, but all over spread within the muffin. I think that gives the muffin a nice moist texture, like a date pudding or \"huat kueh\". Oops and did I forget to mention the equally generous fresh cranberries! 
Is it only me, but their coffees are getting better and better! Try the naked panther beans.
TGI-Breakfast! The description was a handful only because you are not settling for avocado on toast.  The portion on this breakkie is phenomenal.  For a moment there i thought i actually got a whole avocado on my plate..... eerrr.... i still do.....  The gargantuan scoop of in house made ricotta is to die for.  Light creamy velvety milky goodness. And the cherry on top was the sprinkle of crunchy toasted almonds which undoubtedly punctuated each mouthful as well as rendering a subtle saltiness but not compromising in texture.
another self cafe hopping nearby my hotel~ had granola with goji berries, chia seeds, pumpkin &amp; sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds w/ homemade vanilla yogurt &amp; fruit salad ($14) accompanied with grapefruit juice ($4+) quite pricey for the food but worth for the environment
Love their poached (yet crunchy) apple, cinnamon maple syrup and candied bacon (just the right balance of sweetness and saltiness).
A cake, a bread, a dessert or a meal? Whichever way you look (drool) at it, THIS is one item you cannot miss at The Lokal. The winning concoction of adding the tangy youghurt to the rich banana bread is unthinkable but works wonderfully. To top it off as icing to the cake (what the French would say as mayo to the fries) is the grilled macadamia nut crumble which adds a new dimension to this cake/bread/dessert/meal. Whatever you feel like calling it. Fall in love!
Updated menu from the Lokal - One of the new salad featuring fresh greens such as roasted cauliflower, carrots, green beans, quinoa, dried apricots, almonds with house dressing. Available on weekday lunch and weekend  brunch menu. 
Here is another mix-and-match combo pulled together from the \"Pimp My Breakfast\" section.\n<br />Not frequently seen, the dark brown pumpernickel bread was soft and had a subtle nuttiness. It went very well with the fried eggs, especially since those liquidy yolks were a ready-made dip. Just as good were the sautéed chunky mushrooms with their satisfying \"meaty\" succulence.
Good morning fellow Burpplers! \n<br />Creamy scrambled eggs + sourdough toast + sautéed spinach + a little tub of butter (for me, myself and I, yippee) = A breakfast I champion 😄 
you have bananas. you have that toast. some cream. grilled to perfection, one can only wonder.
This is @vermachi \'s French toast w house cured bacon n maple cream n apple 😋😋😋
Sticky date pudding! Not among the best I had though it was a bit too sweet
Wasn\'t mine, but my dining partner liked it although he said the dressing was a tad overdone. Overall pretty good though. Wasn\'t as wowed with the lokal, i think it\'s a bit overhyped 
Pretty yummy dish, I initially wanted the roast pumpkin but they changed their menu); the carrots were a bit too hard, it was difficult to cut with a fork 
Cold brew goes down easy but this is recommended only for the serious coffee drinkers. This high octane liquid is pressed using Guatemalan coffee beans. Smooth brew with a smoky, nutty aftertaste and gets more intense as the temperature changes.  
New item on the Lokal breakfast menu - French toast with caramelized apples and crispy bacons, a perfect marriage of sweet and savory. \n<br />Refreshed menu is on its way. Everyone should roll out of bed early for breakfast and brunch.
The yogurt is a clever addition as it mellows and balances out the sweetness and richness of this dish so we can eat more of this without getting jelat/sick of it!
Dropped in for a cuppa mocha! Opt for skinny, as usual, in a feeble attempt to be healthy! #act一个healthy而已
Not the most likely item I would order given their awesome menu of many other stuff I had ordered before. But my curiosity knowing the salmon and mackerel is smoked in-house made me want to try this item. I did not regret. Salmon was nicely done, you can taste the creaminess. The mashed potato in sour cream and dill was a great complement. Chilled shrimps were sweet too. The only thing you need to be ready is it\'s a COLD platter, which is sometimes good for a change.
Didnt really fancy the avocado toast but the chicken panini was good! Shall try the veal burger next time
Still the best (in my opinion) sticky date pudding ever! Topped with smooth vanilla bean ice cream, gula Melaka &amp; icing sugar! This made my Tuesday lunch perfect! Followed by the banana cake with hokey pokey ice cream, another perfect combo! 
For $19, I think the amt of beef they give is too little tho the beef was tender and good. Abit too pricey for the portion, tried and won\'t be back again cuz their service staff at the cashier was so mean and :/ just spoilt the experience from the start 
Back for brunch at one of my fave place! Ham and cheese toasties / Banana bread / Pimp my breakfast ( sour dough, avocado, poached eggs and salmon)! So good and satisfying. Love the cappuccino and latte 😍😍
Heard some stories about their service here, but every visit seemed to be a pleasant one for me. Was initially told that the Banana Bread was unavailable for the day at the counter; that was until the table next to mine managed to get one from the head chef. The waitress willingly came up to ask me if I was still interested in the Banana Bread and immediately offered to change my order. Banana Bread was warm, jiggly and strong with its banana-scent, though not overwhelming. Speckled with icing sugar and seated in a pool of caramel, it was definitely sweet, but not cloying at all. Hokey Pokey Ice-Cream added a welcomed flavour of toffee, which matched the Banana Bread and caramel well. Mix up all of them, and be in for a burst of flavours that\'s not really expected. A Banana Bread that exceeds expectations!
I was having a bad case of craving for their banana bread and so I decided to head down at 1pm (to try my luck) (which obviously I was pushing it since their breakfast menu stop at 11....) and so no surprise, they were out of it and I was recommended the banana cake. Have already tried it before but I wouldn\'t mind having it another time and so I did. Also had a mocha instead of my usual latte and it was good as well 😌
badly need this mocha from the lokal to chase away these blues. it\'s another week folks! have a good one.
The Banana cake with caramelized bananas &amp; hokey pokey ice cream or the Sticky date pudding with caramelized sauce &amp; vanilla ice cream.
toasted banana bread with vanilla icecream, topped with macadamias &amp; caramelised bananas. dope, indeed. #foodporn
With Pork Belly, broken omelette, wilted spinach and chilli jam. Love the breakfast combination and did I mention it comes with a \"Bak You Pok\" (fried pork lard) antenna?
Look at the long \"antenna\". It\'s actually fried pork lard (\"bak you pok\")
The veal schnitzel burger fell short of my expectation. I preferred the beef sandwich. 
Roar!!! Love the power packed flavour of these columbian beans.
Really an unexpectedly good sandwich. Firstly it\'s a cold sandwich, with a generous dressing of avocado &amp; aioli. 😋The chicken used was thigh meat🍗 and flavorful. Although it wasn\'t the panini pressed hot sandwich I was expecting, it turn out a 8.5 out of 10, which I\'ll return for.
The roast onion and grain mustard creme   fraiche was good but overall did not score for me because the beef lacks flavor. Fortunately, I\'ve got some wilted spinach to go with it. Yums. 
A tad sweet but still good 👍 Any recommendation of places w good sticky date dessert?
One of the best I\'ve eaten. Same for the roast beef!
Lokal uses coffee beans from Sarnies, certainly satisfying 👍
Coffee served were really smooth and flavourful. Another great spot to have your caffeine fix and just let pass you by. The sticky date pudding were a tad too sweet for me, but if you have a sweet tooth, this is for you! The ice cream goes wall with it to help reduce the sweetness slightly, not like any other ordinary vanilla ice cream I must say.  
Sticky date pudding ($12) w vanilla ice cream. The ice cream seems to be home made? Smooth and not too sweet, goes really well w it. Sticky date was warm and rich 👍 
😃🍪✨ It was so delicious (My eyes lit up immediately after the first bite) that I made a mental note to myself that I will NEED to have this whenever I am at The Lokal in future! 😊💕
We ordered the Roast Beef on Rye and Smoked Mackerel and Salmon from @thelokalsingapore. Along with the drinks, the meal costs $60. Good food and ambience! \n<br />Once again, HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIM🎂! It was great catching up with you after soooo longggg. Have a good one! \n<br />Thankful for the short break yesterday, 🏃 heading back to dissertation now! 💪💪💪
The panna cotta doesn\'t wobble. In fact, it was a little like cold Greek yoghurt. Balanced it out with grapefruit and crunchy granola. It was good
Still, I\'m reminded that there are many things I can be #thankful for. 😊😀Happy #Humpday folks!
freshly made toasted banana bread. comes with homemade vanilla yogurt and caramalized bananas. love the fact that the freshly baked bread was intentionally made light and just a hint of banana so you get the full-on flavors from the caramelized bananas itself. balancing the sweetness was the light weight yogurt and the toasted macadamias nuts that gave the necessary crunch. am awed. am awed.
Was all excited to enjoy a cup of nice coffee and watch the day go by at The Lokal on a lazy Sunday afternoon. With all the good reviews going on, wasn\'t surprised the cafe was jam packed. I ordered 2 piccolo latte, a fruit salad with yogurt and a granola with yogurt. My granola was served within minutes! I was really hungry, I started to dig in and realised the yogurt was missing. Approached the staff to ask for the yogurt, she took almost 10 mins coming back to say they ran out of yogurt without providing me with an alternative. Then she came back giving me change for the yogurt that was not served, this was the move that totally flipped my appetite. I told her to cancel all my food orders. And all they did was returned my money and served a complimentary muffin of the day. She did come back once to ask if everything was ok, but I was already upset about how things turned out. As a service provider in the F&amp;B industry, you should always inform the customer upfront when the item is oos before the customer pays, and you do not serve an incomplete order. The most you could do was offer me something else and not just throw me back the change. A very disappointing and wasted trip indeed. 
yet another very popular coffee outfit of late - aussie-styled The Lokal. my first coffee from a slayer machine was at jimmy monkey (also aussie-inspired) and was awfully impressed, so naturally with much expectation at lokal. no doubt my flat white was good, if i have to choose between the two, i go with jimmy. personal opinion though
No.
Very awesome toasted banana bread with vanilla yogurt and macadamia nuts! ($12) omnomnom 🍌🍌🍌
With sauerkraut, fantastic bites of salty roast potatoes and a simple fried egg, these good quality sausages shone. It was a hearty portion, good for sharing together with another light dish. Will definitely order again!
A nice light option, especially if you\'re not in the mood for meat. Not the tastiest dish around, but a nice accompaniment to the sausage platter we had. Can get a little repetitive, good to share! Also a little pricey at $18.
Except for the strip of earthquake-level shattering pork crackle used as a giant toothpick to hold the burger together, the presentation was rather matter-of-fact with zero accompaniments.\n<br />Taste-wise, the list of what goes into the burger sounded promising. And separately, they tasted fine. The tender pork belly had been breaded and fried, giving some crunch to each bite. I couldn\'t find any fault with the wilted spinach, \"broken omelette\" and chilli jam either. However when these were packed into one burger, somehow it didn\'t work for me. Honestly, I was underwhelmed. 
After a rather long wait (the service staff explained that they were short-handed in the kitchen today), my sandwich finally arrived. The roast beef was everything Burpplers have been saying it is: juicy and just drop-dead delicious. But as I\'ve never been fond of hard crusts, I wasn\'t really into the rye bread. So between this and the roast chicken panini that I had on a previous visit, I\'d rather order the chicken again.
Because fellow Burpple Tastemaker Wendolyn Teo was full of praises for this dessert, I couldn\'t get down to The Lokal fast enough to try it.\n<br />And after gobbling it down, I absolutely concur with her on its fabulousness. So moist and fluffy, the sweetness level of the large piece of pudding is well controlled so it doesn\'t make you feel like your teeth are going to fall out (unlike a banana cake I had tried yesterday...but let\'s not go there). 
This is another must try dessert after the toasted banana bread.

Homemade Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Mango and Granola. We spotted vanilla specks in the panna cotta and that got us very excited!!Thank you Chef for the #sweet treat! 😉
Back on a second visit to try out their lunch menu. Noticed most on the items are either beef/vegetarian so we both had the same thing- chicken panini ($15) it was HEAVENLY. Love the texture of the bread. Instead of chicken breast, there were thick chunks of chicken thigh meat that tasted so tender and sweet. Love the avocado purée and the combination was magical. Who needs variety?  Ok I\'m not bragging, just personally enjoyed it a lot. 😁 only one downside of it is the slice of bacon in the panini which tasted like Chinese roast pork but I can make do with this.
One of my new favorite! This Aussie style cafe wins hands down in terms of food, service and ambience. Went there on a weekday morning for breakfast and it\'s pretty quiet. Nice place to chill at. Went ahead to pimp my breakfast: smoked salmon($6), fried of scrambled eggs ($5), sour dough ($4) with grilled mushrooms ($4). They were generous with their serving and there\'s no service charge.
Grilled sausages with onion jam ($23) additional smoked salmon ($6) refer to my previous review. 
This is a RIDICULOUSLY GOOD heap of total homemade awesomeness! Whoever thought of putting vanilla yogurt together with the banana bread is seriously genius. And as though that isn\'t fantastic enough, there\'s caramelised bananas and roasted macadamia nuts too. Whatever else you order, make sure you leave space in your tummy for this. 
Thanks to fellow Burppler Chua Xing Wei, I learned about The Lokal\'s chicken sandwich. And after trying it, I have to agree with him that it is truly one of the tastiest chicken sandwiches around.\n<br />The chicken meat itself is already very moist and flavourful, unlike other places where dry, tasteless chicken has to rely on tonnes of sauces and what-not\'s to prop up its inadequacy. The Lokal\'s sandwich further excites your tastebuds by tucking the crispest pancetta inside. I find that when it comes to pancetta, there is a fine line between salty pork heaven and tough-as-chewing-leather hell. Theirs is, thankfully, the former. Holding both these delicious meats, plus cos lettuce and tomatoes together, is a fresh panini that\'s been slathered with smashed avocado and lovely aioli.\n<br />To say that I am satisfied with my sandwich is an understatement.
How many times have you ordered a big breakfast at a cafe and ended up not liking every single item on the plate? Exactly. We\'ve all been there, haven\'t we?\n<br />To allow for complete customisation and therefore, higher customer satisfaction, the smart folks at The Lokal designed a section in their menu entitled \"Pimp My Breakfast\" that lets you choose from 14 different items (eggs done in assorted styles, smoked salmon, smoked mackerel, dry-cured bacon, sausages, homemade ricotta, avocado, chunky fries etc), as well as 3 types of bread and 4 types of spreads.\n<br />On my first visit, I pimped my breakfast with fried eggs, sautéed mushroom, wilted spinach and sourdough toast. All this came to slightly less than sixteen bucks. I found the toast to be a bit hard but otherwise, I was more than satisfied with the quality and taste of the food.\n<br />If you\'re in a group, it\'s kind of cool to order numerous items to share since they offer such a large variety.
Thank goodness the coffee here is as good as the food. My latte was smooth, mild and very enjoyable. Not surprising since The Lokal gets their beans from Sarnie\'s and uses a lean, mean, custom-built Slayer machine. I see myself returning, and often. My crystal ball never lies ;)
Becos\' taking photos of latte before drinking is too mainstream. // This is the 2nd time my latte art remain intact after drinking. The 1st was at CSHH. I\'m impressed. Lovin\' the coffee at Lokal! 💕☕
Generous portions and such interesting flavours! I loved this dish, the avocado was perfectly ripe! Could taste the hard work that goes into this combo of house prepared ingredients! 3/4 latte, beans from Sarnies - medium bodied, served w a cute house made biscotti. Roast beef on rye was great too! Huge kudos to Chef Darren and his amazing team! Thanks for the yummy apple pie on the house, the apple was poached to perfection,and the ice cream (black doris plum?) was unique adding the right sweetness! In love w this place!
Yums! Just what I needed on a Friday afternoon. 
Love the feel at this cafe. And the food is  comforting to the soul. One doesn\'t need good/fantastic food all the time but just food that complements the soul. Perhaps its the atmosphere of the cafe or the friendly service or the food that make one feel so comfortable in this space. 
A proper salad! Great blend of flavours, fresh, wholesome and delightful!
This place is great! 🙌 good vibes good food good people. Don\'t be fooled by the photo it\'s always packed during lunch!
This place is great! 🙌 good vibes good food good people. Had a great chat w chef Darren about using fresh ingredients, doing what they can in house (their own yogurt, ketchup +), and serving some amazing tasting food at affordable prices! Love the concept and happy that I now have a perfect place to churn out work at, enjoy yummy wholesome salads. 😊 definitely coming back for breakfast/brunch!
Healthy? Check. Flavourful? Double check. Delicious? Check check check. This charming cafe serves up light, hearty fares. Here, I\'ve devoured on the pumpkin, beetroot, quinoa and mixed veg salad, dressed in vinaigrette that wasn\'t too twangy at all; in-house smoked mackerel and salmon (which tasted pretty raw and that\'s a plus point! And these smoked fishes don\'t leave a weird aftertaste unlike some which you get from packages); roasted beef with mustard in toasted rye bread, which was divine but I wished it was a tad more salty. The smooth, nutty coffee was perfect and the mixed berry smoothie could be a bit thicker. Overall, this meal was pretty damn good and I can\'t wait till my next visit. 
Great food with great company. The toasted banana cake with macadamia nuts was to die for.
Close to perfection. Wonderfully toasted bread with beef slices, so full of flavour and fresh tasting. Unlike those soggy sandwiches which tends to get heavy on the stomach. Definitely recommend this!
I find the fish a tad salty to eat on it\'s own, but was good when paired with the plain pita bread or mashed potato. The side vegetables helped cleanse the fishy taste and saltiness. While I liked the chunkiness of the salmon, I won\'t be raving about this dish. 
This Aussie-inspired cafe boasts quality food with quality ingredients. They smoke their own salmon, cure their own meat and make their own yoghurt. Go for their roast beef on rye ($17), or the banana cake with caramelised bananas and hokey pokey Ice-cream ($12). Australian indie vibes, aromatic coffee with a kick, mouthwatering food, and oh yes - free WiFi. What\'s not to love?
Thought this is one of those rare times he didn\'t have eggs for breakfast. But he pimped this salad wi h 2 poached eggs... Nevermind that, this Salad of Roast Pumpkin, Quinoa &amp; Mixed Greens is simply outstanding! \n<br />#burpple #thelokalsingapore #thelokalsg #neilroad #cafesg
Banana cake with caramelized bananas served with caramel &amp; cream. Ultimate comfort food! Have a try at the sticky date pudding too! Pure goodness 😍
(smashed Avocado, home made ricotta, smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, toasted rye, home made peanut butter &amp; butter) \n<br />Flat whites on a custom V3 Slayer espresso machine. \n<br />This is what I call wholesome food #burpple 😍👍
Choose your own breakfast sides to create your own customised breakfast platter! Shown here is the combination of Pumpernickel, Sautéed Mushrooms and Bacon Strips
Simple dish using sourdough bread sandwiching tomatoes, lean chicken meat, fresh lettuce, bacon strips and avocado. Always great with your cuppa!
This is really the best sticky date I\'ve eaten till date. Super good. It\'s not cloyingly sweet, and soft and moist. Warmed to the right temperature and when it goes with the vanilla ice cream. Mmhmm. 
With home made vanilla yogurt, toasted macadamias and Caramelized banana. All my fave things in a dish. It\'s just so good I can finish it all on my own. Just seeing the picture makes me wanna have it now 😞😞
Topped with home made vanilla yogurt, toasted macadamias and chia seeds. Not a smart choice at a cafe because it\'s fruits which you can easily get from the supermarket. But I guess what makes it special is the toasted macadamias and the vanilla yogurt!
With goji berries, nuts &amp; seeds, drizzled with home made vanilla yogurt TOPPED WITH POACHED PEAR. The pear was just superrrr goood. I could eat like five of it alone if they have that. The granolas wise were a tad too hard. My mouth were aching after I was done chewing. The vanilla yogurt was neither too sour or sweet, just right. Yumz 
With sautéed potatoes, fried egg and onion jam. Yummy sausages and potatoes. 👍👍
I came here thrice in a week and basically eating the same thing over and over. What else can I say?
With pickles and pita bread. Not my kinda dish but my partners polished it off so i guess they must be pretty good 😂
With pork belly, broken omelette spinach and chilli jam. Good combination and well balanced flavors where there wasn\'t any overpowering taste of one ingredient over the other. I don\'t really fancy the crispy pork belly skin though it\'s kinda like the highlight of the skin. (It\'s just me actually, I don\'t like pork belly and I don\'t like skins of fish, chicken etc) haha. 
With grilled pineapple, cheese, red slaw, anchovy mayo and served with French fries. I would prefer this to the breakfast burger mainly because there\'s pineapple and cheese and I like the taste and texture of the patty used here. Hehe. 
With crispy pancetta, tomatoes, avocados, cos and aioli. Couldn\'t taste any unique flavor of the chicken. Tasted rather bland to me if not for the other ingredients. Hmm  
Envy goes Lokal. Totally dig the cafe vibes with a mother of God Slayer espresso machine, what\'s there not to envy? \n<br />On a side note, zhng my breakfast with runny poached eggs, sour dough and damm crispy bacon strips. The 3 prime evil of brunches, what cam go wrong?
Now I wanna recreate the Beef😛 Finally met @lkkben here too!
Toasted banana bread with home made vanilla yogurt, toasted macadamia and Caramelized banana ($12) one happy tummy. Mega love this combination. 
What I guess as the \"sticky date pudding\" was on the house as the chef was experimenting with the recipe. Was good as well. And less sweet compared to the banana cake (which might be due to the syrup). Spent a total of $85. They do not have service charge. Only gst 😄😄
The desserts were to my liking of course. Anything sweet is to my liking actually 😂😂 anyway, tried the banana cake with hokey pokey ice cream and it\'s good (duh) the looks already won half the battle 😂😂 my partners found it cloyingly sweet but I thought it was alright, maybe lesser syrup would be good so that the real taste of the banana cake wouldn\'t be masked. The other was a Valrhona chocolate tart with mascarpone cheese - glad to say it wasn\'t very sweet, there was actually a hint of bitterness in it. Good for those who doesn\'t like milk chocolate. Hehe. Can\'t really taste the mascarpone cheese but that doesn\'t really matter to me. 
Only 2-3 weeks old and I\'m amazed by what they can offer. Good food, good coffee, friendly staff, photogenic space, open kitchen concept with all the Ang moh chef, even the toilet left an impression 😂😂 they clearly made an effort in every detail of the cafe - from the peaceful and calm colors 🔵⚫️⚪️ to the rustic and wooden chairs and tables as well as the decoration of the walls and counters. So loving this place. Came during tea time on a Tuesday afternoon and I\'m glad to say that it isn\'t crowded (yet, it\'ll soon be I believe). Tried the two dish recommended by the staff which is the veal burger and roast beef on rye and I\'m glad to say that the food was good. I love the mixture of the flavors of the burger. The roast beef was also super yummy along with the Caramelized onions. 👍👍👍 would definitely come back during the weekends because I think they have a different menu 😌😌😌
If you\'re the kind of person who likes a heavier coffee taste then you will definitely like their coffee - Dark roast with medium body. Coffee was pretty well balanced and with pretty art (that\'s a plus). Their machine - The Slayer; \"fully customized and there\'s only two in Singapore and one is here.\" as introduced by the barista (Like a happy little kid showing his prize possession)
Yet another cuppa at The Lokal that was bright with distinct fruity notes with just the right ratio of milkiness. The barista sure knows the preferences I have for my coffee :)
Back a third time to try their bakes. Fluffy bun with sticky sweetness that has a malt-like consistency surrounding it. Comes with candied walnuts in the middle. It\'s sweetness came a bit cloying as it felt quite heaty, but it tastes so good I don\'t mind it at all.
Gorgeous, rustic and a fantastic place to chill! Service is excellent
The tomato ketchup is of a thicker consistency.Can distinctly taste the subtle taste of vinegar while not losing the taste of fresh tomatoes.
Pimp my own breakfast - scrambled eggs, wilted spinach and my favourite smoked mackerel
With pork belly, broken omelette, spinach and chilli jam. I didn\'t have this but apparently it was gooood. 
Really liked the flavours in this burger. Especially liked the grilled pineapple sandwiched between two pieces of veal schnitzel (which I felt were slightly tough). Also, I think I\'ve found my favourite fries 😊 Gonna get a side of fries the next time! 
Starting my weekend with good food and good company. I had the pumpkin quinoa salad, the pumpkin was soft and fragrant accompanied with sunflower seeds and cranberries. And the fries, which we all agreed, were golden crisp and delish! The cafe is tucked at a corner of Neil road, slightly away from the cbd crowd which is really nice to wind down with a cup of nice coffee. 
But first, coffee. The weekend is finally here, am welcoming it with caffeine dose! 
One of the cafe that\'s the talk of the town now. Sadly, I was terribly disappointed by the roasted chicken panini. I practically returned the whole thing back to the server cos I simply just can\'t force myself to eat the bread. I think I need to give them another chance but not until I forget how I spent $15 on a horrible bread. Coffee was excellent though.
It\'s Friday....Need I say anymore!
Think of the usual apple crumble, adding a refreshing light zing from the sourness of juicy pineapple chunks to the sweet dessert. An intriguing flavour, made better with a scoop of rich and smooth Vanilla ice-cream by the side.
The table\'s favourite dish of the day. Loved how tender the beef was and that it did not carry any gamey taste as well, and the proportion of beef and vegetables was just perfect that we were just craving for more! What can be better than that when it comes with sweet caramalised onions and crispy Rye?
Chicken Sandwiches are usually a safe and predictable option in cafes but this was just impressive; the freshness of the greens and tomatoes were just mind-blowing, especially the tomatoes which were bursting a sweet yet zesty juiciness. The roasted chicken was tender, and the buttery avocado puree worked really well in creating a somewhat savoury flavour further enhanced by crispy bacon within.
Tender roast beef slices with caramelized onions and veggie packed between the ryes. Unfortunately, our poached eggs were overdone and we had to send it back. We never got a nicely done one in return (some burner troubles) but the staff came to check with us if it was okay for scrambled eggs replacement. The chef also came to our table to apologize for the matter (when it was less busy), so everything ended well! Love the laid back melbourne-esque cafe vibes of this new joint too!
No pretense.
Really tasty!
Amazing succulent beef (in a pretty generous portion) topped with caramelized onions to give an appetizing mouth-filled ending. Definitely coming back for more! 
Citrus kicks, smooth ending. Coffee lovin\'! 
A whole bunch of stuff, think ordered the entire menu almost.
Love to have the juice dripping all over. The beef flavors combined well with the caramelized onions. Went for lunch on a Sunday, and surprisingly there was still a table for us. Trust me, this place is just going to get more crowded!
A man\'s meal well balanced with meat and carbs. On the burger sesame bun rests breaded pork belly, which alludes to a phantom potato hash. 
I love this!!!! The smoked salmon was good but I love the smoked mackerel. It was outstanding! Pita bread and light and fluffy.
Served with chunky chips.
What a way to spend your Saturday afternoon.
With mustard, creme fraiche, onions and cress. Excellently executed, the slices of beef were tender and ever so slightly pink in the middle. One of the best roast beef sandwiches I\'ve had for sure, where the proportion of bread to meat to veg is perfect. 
With pickled cabbage, beetroot, pumpkin and carrot, and soft pillows of pita. This is my new all-time favourite brunch item, light and gorgeous. The house smoked fish is incredible, you\'ve gotta try it, even though you might be tempted to order more \"common\" brunch items. 
Mixed fruits with homemade vanilla yogurt ,toasted macadamias and chia seeds
Though slightly too sweet for me but I still love it 
First time I had latte art for ice latte and it taste great
Veal schnitzel burger is above average for sure. Fries are awesome!Chef bothers to balance the whole experience with some pickled vegetable. Thumbs up
They are back! It is all good again (just like at sarnies when they first started!)
Addicted to the energy of starting up. Love the space and laid back vibes right smack in the city. #burpple
Love the space, love the coffee here. Makes you feel right out of a city like Melbourne. Will be back again.
Love the vibes here. Huge tables and yes, power. Just want to get a coffee and finish a book right here. The back actually gives a more \'modern\' feel. 
Sometimes, I\'m quite amazed at my own appetite. Special request to change some items on the standard menu as I can\'t really take much bread. $17 for this, super reasonable!
They have counter seats facing the kitchen here and are way cooler than the ones in front that\'s having all the heat trapped. Have a cuppa and watch them churn out all that foodporn coming out from the kitchen; I will be back to try their sandwiches soon!
This new place is already flooded up with people on the second day of operations! They offer two sorts of beans; Colombian and Tanzanian which I had the latter. Light bodied with nutty and slight floral tones, its also slightly acidic but really enjoyable. 
Coffeexcited at the coffee where the barista slayed for me with 11 layers in style. Read on the blog.
Love the texture and taste. And not too sweet. 
A collab with the popular Sarnies, The Lokal features breakfast and lunch items like Triple Cheese &amp; Mushroom toasties, Veal schnitzel burger, and excellent coffee. Great to have another quality cafe in the Duxton area!
Coffee\'s up for grab until 6pm today if you\'re nearby guys!
Really love the food here!

The mix of assortments add savory favors to the salad. It can taste slightly salty after a while. For the pasta, I will consider again, the crabmeat is generous but the pasta is overcooked, but it’s a big portion for people who are hungry give it a go! For the price, I will say you are paying a bit for the cafe environment. #burpple #sgfoodie #foodsg #foodblogger #sgfoodblog #blogfood #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe

Off the menu item, as a special surprise dessert. The soft centre of the meringue is soft like a marshmallow and even with the thick vanilla cream, the whole dessert is so light and refreshing, with the fruit cubes of watermelon, rock melon, honey dew and blueberries appearing to floating in this cloud of sheer delight. Thanks to the fuzzychef.
Thanks @thelokalsingapore for sending this Pavlova over to our table. @nantheless and I may have been stuffed from lunch but that didn\'t stop us from gleefully launching an attack.\n<br />How could we possibly not be excited to taste fresh soursop, passionfruit and roasted pineapples heaped on to light-as-air, crisp meringue. Its description on the \"specials\" board had already caught our attention when we walked in. Well, it turned out just like I\'d anticipated: refreshing and fruity, with a lovely balance struck between sour and sweet.\n<br />Congrats @fuzzychef on adding yet another tempting dessert to your repertoire 👍😋
Medium bodied, smooth micro foam, a solid cuppa.
🌻 * Entertainer: 1-1 main course
Wonderfully moist and warm when served, every bite is such an impeccable pairing with the hokey pocky ice cream (a vanilla ice cream with honeycomb toffee in it). Throw in some of that caramelized bananas and it went up a couple of notches in the yummy factor.\n<br />_________________\n<br />The LoKal\n<br />Address: 136, Neil Road, Singapore 088865\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #thelokalsg

Not quite a birthday cake but equally satisfying. 🎂
So I was drawn to the soba noodles (also because it was right in front of me). It had beetroot cured salmon, which was good but also not spectacular. To my pleasant surprise, the salad was one of my favourites! Think it was the pine nuts and the whey dressing... I guess they suit me. 🤔
Homemade kaya &amp; butter, pain de mie toast &amp; 64° egg
Love both the food and the ambience. Ordered the pumpkim salad and beef burger, the salad was great and crunchy, while the beef was fat and juicy. Despite the place being crowded it was not too noisy (unlike many cafes). Used the entertainer app for the mains. Alittle pricy on a-la-carte thou

The sweet warm fuzzy feeling you get from the sticky date pudding and the creaminess from the vanilla ice cream makes it\'s a kickass combination.

The Baked Eggs ($20++) left much to be desired. It\'s not that they\'re not photogenic. It\'s a combination of this being pricey &amp; the yolks being slightly overcooked, &amp; this dish being too simple to justify the price. It wasn\'t awful, just not worth it.
Banana Bread with Homemade Ricotta Cheese ($14++) - a surprisingly good find. Perfectly moist bread, great caramelization on the bananas, &amp; the sauce wasn\'t sickeningly saccharine sweet. Yum! 🍌🍞❤️
A little on the sweet side but definitely delicious!

Steadfastly decided to try something different and in the end had to spend the meal leering at the the lobster roll. Not that it was a bad burger, although it could do with more greens (burger ingredients: sunny side up runny egg, hashbrown and beef patty). Used #entertainerapp which doesn\'t apply to the pimp my breakfast or daily specials.
Loving these enamel ware :D 👍👍👍 #lemongrassgingergreentea #enamel #thelokalsg #thelokal
Super breakfast. That home cured bacon 👍👍👍😋😋😋😋🍳🍄🍄 #thelokalsg #breakfast #tanjongpagar #thelokalsingapore #egg #bacon #mushrooms #potatoes
Nice coffee art . Nice coffee
Delightful brunch where you can choose your own ingredients ! Tasty and delish !
To celebrate #LOKALTURNS2 yesterday, @fuzzychef specially created three food items that were available in the food menu only for that one day and we were some of the lucky ones to have tasted them. Currywurst ($8) was the most addictive as chilli and curry sauce on sausage and fries brought back many fond memories during my travels in Berlin, Germany. Once again, congratulations on this special day and many well wishes for years to come.
Homemade butter, wild berry and peanut butter.
Simply can\'t resist this Sticky Date Pudding! A sweet ending to girls night out with @abdency 💖👯. The pudding was served warm and I love its dense texture too. This was nicely complemented by vanilla bean ice-cream.

Da bomb and da highlight. Love it
Served warm with a thick butterscotch sauce, cool vanilla yogurt, toasted hazelnuts and freshly-grated orange zest, it\'s too scrumptious to miss out on when you\'re at The Lokal. #veronicaphuaeats #thelokal #thelokalsg #bananabread #housemade #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #instafoodsg #instavid #chefatwork #sgcafe #cafesg #dessertsg #sgfoodies #BurppleTastemaker
Goji berries, pumpkin, sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds &amp; homemade vanilla yoghurt. Loved the crunch from the nuts and how everything went together when you mix em up! Try this if you are the granola type or just want smtg lighter 😊
Back at my fav cafe!! Got the granola this time! Loved how the yoghurt is made in house. And many other things, like bacon, butter, ricotta &amp; peanut butter 
Served with sourdough bread as the base with 2 huge scoop of ricotta and avocado and finally finished with roasted nuts and pomelo on the top. This dish is just simple and light. Too bad they did not have my curly fries!!! 😭
Yummy!
So decided to give Lokal a shot. The lobster meat was sweet and fresh. The bun was slightly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Making it a decent lobster roll but the gherkin and lemon mayo was a bit too mild. \n<br />Ok forget about Mac\'s curly fries, this curly fries is the BOMB! It was just addictive ! \n<br />The entertainer app have 1-for-1 promotion for mains! So I will be back for more! #sgfoodies #burpple #sgfood #outrampark #whatieat
A cortado is an espresso cut with a small amount of warm milk.[1] The word cortado is the past participle of the Spanish verb cortar (to cut), in the sense of \"dilute\". If this is called dilute, I\'m sure I won\'t need the intense version

And of course, with a good friend.
Lobster chunks were generous enough. Only wish the lobster roll could have been more savoury in taste.

I have two from other places that comes close.  Need I say more??? When I first saw the semolina cake on the menu, I thought of a cornbread-like cake or a Spanish/Italian cornmeal cake but I was so wrong, the cake came like a light mousse that\'s smooth and creamy. It felt like it was a cooked semolina that\'s puréed and made into a mousse.  The cake goes well with the accompanying berries and strawberry ice cream. It\'s like eating homemade desserts, in this case, prepared by chefs.  Finished in no time! \n<br />The Lokal, Singapore
Served with a pumpkin and crunchy green beans and quinoa. A squeeze of lemon juice na sits ready. Yum! \n<br />The Lokal, Singapore
So goood!
But who am I kidding right. 😧

Another one of their outstanding dishes that deserves a spot in the limelight is the Toasted Banana Bread ($12). How can anyone resist a loaf of moist banana bread with homemade vanilla yogurt, toasted macadamias and caramelized bananas. The long list of ingredients is already making my mouth water. It\'s like having a party in your mouth when you take the first bite of all the elements that make up this dish. Also, I am just as clueless as to why it took me so long to make my first visit to The LoKal. Guess good things are worth the wait and this wait is well worth it. |\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping
Before that, I will always recommend RONIN Cafe to my friends for the scrambled eggs and WICKED coffee. Now, I can finally add The LoKal to my recommended list of cafes for serving excellent food. I have long wanted to try The LoKal and finally got the opportunity to drop them a visit for brunch on a lovely Saturday. My mind was set upon looking at the weekend brunch menu and my eyes zoomed straight at the Pimp My Breakfast section. Choosing two slices of bread ($1.50), scrambled eggs ($5), sautéed potatoes ($5) and smoked mackerel on cherry woodchips ($6), my hearty brunch came up to $17.50, the usual price nowadays but the food served here is so much better than the rest. I foresee more visits to The LoKal in the near future.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

Seeing those ice cream melts seamlessly with the coffee 😌
it\'s @thelokalsongapore one year here in \n<br />our sunny island #photolokal1stbd happy birthday guys!
Well the taste is complicated to describe. All I could say was the warm bread was as soft as #cake and comforting. The warmed bananas were fragrant. The #macademia and the sauce were #delicious , yet I wished the sauce could be a stronger kind of sweet or yoghurt-sour #thelokalsg #photolokal1stbd

Great cheesy pasta with a great brew... 
Pulled lamb salad(not on menu), thank you Darren @fuzzychef !!🙆🙆
😇
I bet cha needing one right now after the long four days of holiday.
I particularly enjoy their house-smoked (nitrite-free) mackerel &amp; salmon - moist flakes with a gentle level of smokiness, easy on the salt. #thelokalsg #thelokalsingapore #thelokal #coffee #brunch #delicious #burpple
Pimp your breakfast, and be sure to get their house-smoked salmon! Don\'t leave without trying a dessert too. Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Veronica Phua #Burpple
Even with a little milk, the medium acidity of the Fuzzy Wuzzy blend is apparent. Quite lovely. #thelokal #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #1_cafe #sgcafe #burpple

STICKY DATE PUDDING IS THE BEST DATE I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. OMG. \n<br />Sticky date pudding ($10) from #thelokal.
I like how the lamb doesn\'t have that strong pungent odour. very tasty 😋
😀
don\'t you agree?
French toast $15 and black Pearl BLT $16
One word : SHIOK
A comforting dish on a rainy night.  I\'m setting myself up by editing this picture at this hour.!😭😭
how not to like ?? you can vaguely taste that lambpy odour commonly found in lamp. blessed that I was invited.
It got me scrapping the plate when it\'s gone! Definitely going back for this sticky date pudding and their brunch 😋
Their mocha was amazing too. 😍
AH. Am I in heaven yet?
It was da bomb. I would come back for this.  #burpple

An excellent choice for a simple and hearty meal!
That\'s maple cream on top but I don\'t take dairy so can\'t review that. Lunch and dessert combined into a single dish #burpple

I\'m a big fan of The Plain\'s coffee but doubtful now because this iced soy mocha was so good that I wanted more! #burpple
Question. Does coffee taste better using a 40k Slayer?
A banana cake with way too much syrup and a non existent hokey pokey ice cream.
