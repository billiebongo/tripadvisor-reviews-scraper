Priced at $15/100grams, this 1.1 kg boned in steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and came with sides of sautéed mushrooms and vegetables and fried potatoes. Portions are huge so come with ample stomach space!
Such generous portions for both starters I had.\n<br />❤️\n<br />The lamb chops were amazingly tender and I actually liked the potatoes that came with it a lot. Crispy but soft on the inside\n<br />❤️\n<br />Wine recommendation went well with my lamb chops.  My taste buds went for a ride to cloud 9!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodgasm #foodspotting #foodoftheday #onthetable #yummyinmytummy #healthyeating #audeats #eatwelll #wherewhatwow #feedingtime #foodpics #cravings #cravingsatisfied #fooddiscovery #eatingdisorderrecovery #buzzfeast #foodandwine #foodshot #musttry #burpple #tastespotting #foodgawker #foodandwine #foodtrend #lifecravings #daluca #unitrufflepasta #happybirthdaytome #burpple
I have no words. No, I have 2 words - \'cardio tomorrow\' lolllll ❤️😋😍❤️\n<br />・・・\n<br />Da Luca is da bomb!!! 💣💥\n<br />・・・\n<br />#dinnertime #andallthegoodstuff #whati8today #foodstagram #instafoodsg #instafoodie #igfood #igfoodie #burpple #uniscalloptrufflepasta #lambchops  #lobstertagliatelle
okay, i exaggerate cos i haven\'t even tried every item myself but from whatever other stuff i\'ve had, i guarantee you with all my heart that this is a restaurant that Michelin inspectors really shouldn\'t overlook. \n<br />Da Luca\'s Pork Chops are moist, extremely tender, and doesn\'t have that porky after-taste that many people are afraid of (you might even have to recall what exactly you\'ve ordered) without overwhelming condiments or sauces, i really wonder how the meat can be so succulent and yums! but hey, let me give you a tip - grab those sticks of ribs first before the meaty parts. they\'re pretty addictive!
Fantastic.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #whati8today #iweeklyfood #sgfood #sgfoodporn #foodspotting #foodforfoodies #sharefood #foodpics #foodporn #foodpornsg #foodphoto #foodphotography #instafood #instafoodsg #instafoodie #vscofood #foodvsco #singaporefood #singapore #foodgasm #sgig
at SGD88 (enough to feed two pax), this is a hefty price tag for a starter but it is so good, you\'ve got to at least try this once in your lifetime. i\'m sure you cannot NOT try it anyway, cos the moment you step into restaurant, the truffle smell just overwhelms you and puts you in a truffle coma and you will instantly forget how much you\'re gonna be paying for your meal 😝

Their Osso Bucco (food coma material) is a must-try, and their lunch sets are only priced at $22++ each. \n<br />Penne with baby shrimp in a tomato cream sauce and parma ham with rock melon were part of today\'s lunch set. 😋😋 #burpple #burpplesg #sgdaily #sgfood #eatandeatonly #sgfoodie #fatdieme

So so good! #secretmenu #datenight #burpple #burp #lifechanging #truffleoverdose
I thought it would be heavy on the spices (and maybe a hint of sweetness) but it was full of seafood goodness with hints of capsicum and a number of savory notes.  Definitely worth ordering on my next visit! My photo probably doesn\'t do justice on how good this is. *\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />Da Luca Italian Restaurant, Novena, Singapore\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #nomnomnom #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #getinmybelly #pasta #buzzfeast #food #seafood #instagram #delicious #foodcoma #sinful #eater #prawns #italianfood #burpple #nice #eeeeats #bbcgoodfood #foodgawker #gastronogram
