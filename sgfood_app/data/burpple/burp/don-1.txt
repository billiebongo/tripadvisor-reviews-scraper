A recommended choice by @royceng. This affordable rice bowl in a coffee shop setting is probably the biggest draw factor. At about $9 for this don, you get a sou vide egg, a salmon steak creamed with mentaiko. Honestly, I was expecting 2 salmon steaks but I guess it would be out of their budget to do so. The salmon steaks were soft and slightly moist and not grilled. If I remember correctly it was also done by sou vide, hence the texture.
There is wagyu beef, roasted pork, salted egg tempura veg&amp;prawn, mentaiko salmon and parmesan chicken. The chicken was bleh, roasted pork wasn\'t crispy. Wagyu beef and salmon are the best of all. 2 of us couldn\'t finish the bowl. Worth it? You judge. üëçüèª3.5/5\n<br />‚úîÔ∏è worth trying but wouldn\'t specially make a trip down for this. üìçLavender MRT
Ordered the salmon mentaiko don - apparently the number 1 to try, and the fish was goooood, as was the rice and sauce. However, the portion of salmon was SO SMALL - disappointed as I can safely say this is the smallest serving of salmon I\'ve ever had in a salmon don.
üçΩ: Wagyu Beef Don¬†\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Price: $12.90¬†\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Lavender ¬†\n<br />üìç:30 Foch Road, #01-02\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Charging at a coffee shop price, I have to say the owner was generous with their portion. The wagyu beef don comes with more than 8 slices of beef, Sous vide and rice, which is enough to feed the hungry me.¬†\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The beef was slightly charred giving it a crisp outer layer, well the inner layer was still moist and had a chewy texture, however, the meat was lacking in flavour. It was bland and did not contain any sweetness of the beef. Some part of the rice was still undercooked. Luckily the egg was still runny and it gave some taste to the Don.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, the Don was indeed cheap but it was lacking in quality. My opinion is to give some time for Don.Ê°£ to grow as they are still trying to adjust their menu and accommodating to the large influx of customers. Well, I heard recently they just updated their menu
Huge Kyodai Don ($28.90) good for 2-4 pax. 3pax for lunch is just nice. An assortment of toppings like tempura prawns &amp; vege, beef (too chewy), fried chicken (not tt good), mentai salmon, sio bak, onsen egg. Value for money! Can pop by if you are around the corner but wouldnt go out of the way for it.
A new entrant to the hip hawkers scene is this little coffeeshop stall specialising in Japanese rice bowls with a modern slant. $9.90 gets you a hearty bowl of sous vide mentaiko salmon (with the perfect, succulent, semi-raw texture), onsen egg, and furikake-specked Japanese rice. Love the addition of pickles to refresh the palate.
Saw people talking about this new place that\'s now in the spot where The Western Co. used to be on Burpple and since it was so near the office, decided to just pop by for dinz! üç¥
Taking over the exact same space from that infamous western food stall that committed suicide by social media, Don. serves up high quality and absolutely appetizing Japanese ricebowls. And it\'s worth every penny of the low, low price of admission.
Found this on burpple and I\'ve always longed to try it! Decided to make my way there after work. Wagyu beef is tender just like how Wagyu should be. It goes well with the well seasoned rice.Wished the portions are a little bigger. Well I\'m a big eater. Good value for money!
I had initially baulked against the price of this Wagyu Beef Bowl item on the menu. But given the prices that other Japanese restaurants would quote for an equivalent of this, this is DEFINITELY a steal. So I bit the bullet and paid for it. You\'ll need to pay additional one dollar for the miso soup; an option I didn\'t take up
Went to support my friend\'s event opening at Foch road and tried the off menu kyodai don which encompasses all of their mains. Their mains are consist of some of the more staple foods in Japanese cuisine, namely - salmon, beef and tempura, as well as a more local take on Japanese food like roast pork and garlic chicken. I was honestly blown away by the food quality and I think it might even give the food at bigger establishments like MOF and Sushi Tei a run for their money.\n<br />Waiting time might be slightly long for a hawker store, but rest assured that the wait is worth it.
Located next to Royal J\'s Seafood in Lavender, this coffeeshop stall dishes out quality rice bowls at affordable prices, perfect for nearby office workers looking for new dining options. There are six protein bowls to choose from, and prices range from $7.90 to $12.90. We love the value-for-money Wagyu Beef Don ($12.90) ‚Äî tender slices of perfectly smoked beef set on a bed of white, fluffy rice and topped with a wobbly sous vide egg. The Mentaiko Salmon Don ($9.90) is commendable too ‚Äî a nicely seared salmon fillet slathered with a drippy mentaiko sauce that reminded us of Gyoza-Ya\'s mentaiko miso gyoza. If you\'re just popping by for a tea break or eating in a group, order their Dragon Fries ($6) ‚Äî these piped out mashed potatoes are coated with cheese before going into the deep-fryer!\n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hilary See
This is one tasty salmon don with pocket-friendly prices! Bowls start from $7.90-$12.90. Love how drippy the mentaiko sauce is (very much like the mentaiko sauce from Gyoza Ya) and the sous vide egg is wobbly every single time! üç≥
Taking over the stall formerly belonging to The Western Co. at the Foch Road coffeeshop is Don.Ê°£, a stall that serves Japanese-style Don including Mentaiko Salmon Don, Salted Egg Tempura Don and Garlic Parmesan Don amongst other items on the menu.
Too bad the sous vide egg was blocked by a bunch of ugly seaweed. hahaha. ‚†Ä ‚ú®#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower

Salted Egg Tempura Don ($9.80). A salty twist from your normal tempura don, the salted egg yolk taste was not strong enough but however makes you want more of the tempura. It is served with a sous vide egg too.‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚ú® #sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #hawkerfare #bestfoodworld #devourpower
Tried two stalls at one go. Ordered the fried porridge for 2 pax ($6) from Royal J\'s Seafood. It\'s my first time trying fried porridge. I liked that it was laced with tasty ingredients like shredded cuttlefish, diced yam, fried shallots and crispy pork lards with a certain amount of wok hei flavor in the porridge. Ordered the Wagyu Beef Don ($12.90) and Dragon Fries ($6) from Don which is just next to Royal J. I felt that the beef slices were slightly over cooked and was quite disappointed. Enjoyed the Dragon Fries which were charcoal fries served with truffle flakes. Would like to come back again and give the Mentaiko Salmon Don a try.
Features their 6 signature meats- mentaiko salmon, wagyu beef, salted egg tempura, Korean chicken, Sio bak, garlic Parmesan chicken, topped with sous vid egg. A really satisfying meal meant to be shared amongst 2-4 pax. Love the crispy Sio bak and the delicious tender salmon topped  with rich mentaiko sauce. .\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm #don #chirashi #fochroad

Affordable Japanese rice bowls with a twist. Loved the seared salmon fillet topped with thick savoury mentaiko. Crispy chicken was a pleasant surprise with its strong garlic and Parmesan flavours blending together to deliver a blast to the tastebuds. And you can\'t go wrong with the perfectly runny sous vide egg mixed with rice ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />#throwback #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm #fochroad #fusiondon #don #japanese #salmon #hawkersg #jiaklocal
Mentaiko Salmon Don.
Although it looks and sounds good, I can\'t help but to feel that the meat is on the chewy side. It does get tiring and monotonous after a while. It\'s still a decent bowl and it\'s value for money but at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself if you\'re willing to spend more for appreciation or less just to have a glimpse of what it could really be ..\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#don#ricebowl#japanesefood#wagyu#wagyudon#beef#onsenegg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#thai#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#fusionfood#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#mandaringallery#STFoodtrending
The meat underneath is more to the medium rare texture which I think they really nailed it down perfectly as it is soft, smooth and sweet. Rice with onsen egg adds the carbs section to this meal.üëçüèΩ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#don#ricebowl#japanesefood#salmon#mentaiko#mentaikosalmon#onsenegg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#thai#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#fusionfood#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#mandaringallery#STFoodtrending

//The beef were sliced a tad too thin and they were slightly over cooked resulting in a chewy texture. Salmon was fresh, soft and tender.
