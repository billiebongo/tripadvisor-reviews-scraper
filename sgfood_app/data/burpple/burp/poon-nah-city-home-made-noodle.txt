Since young, these have been my two most frequent stalls for my ban mien (though I usually order you mien) craving. As Whampoa Market is kinda far for me, I will usually settle for Poon Nah and the usual order is definitely the Sliced Fish Homemade You Mien ($3.00). These are the only two stalls that I know that serves with a clear broth (without egg) and mani chye (sayur manis, 马尼菜). What sets them apart is the super flavorful broth and lip-smacking, ass-burning chilli. Noodles are cooked al-dente which retained its chewiness and you can almost hear each table slurping up the noodles.
辣到....😐 #cityplazasg #sgfood #burpple #vscocam #poonnah #banmian
Chewy noodles, bowl filled with clams and broth goodness!!! 
Good with or without their very potent chilli.
Their chilli is so shiok!
Feeling pampered. 🙆
