Didnt expect much from the cake after tasting the cheesecake, but it gave me a pleasant surprise. Finished the cake faster than i have thought.
The macaron is crispy and not too sweet, while the cheesecake is delicious for the first bite,its easy to get sick of it after a while.
So glad it\'s not Sunday today! [Vanilla Macarons S$2 each] because #TwoIsBetterThan1
Recommended by staff. Surprisingly plain... I find the oreo taste too light. There could be more oreo bits in the cream though. 😧
Finally checked out NOM \'s rainbow cake after so long. Never late then never. 😜
One of the nicest rainbow cake I have tried so far.. The texture is so soft &amp; this really compliments the thick chocolate filling underneath.. :) 
Indeed one of the better rainbow cakes out there but not the best though. 🌈🍰\n<br />•\n<br />The other day I was trying to decide which rainbow cake to choose (4 flavours) but this staff said \'it doesnt work that way\', thinking I was counting the number of cake slices left to find out which one was the best seller. Apparently she wasn\'t jean from X-men 😪
Heard many good reviews for this cafe. So decided to pop by to have a slice. IT WAS SO SO PRETTY! But sadly, it doesn\'t taste as good as it seems. I felt like I was literally eating butter + whip cream. Cake was also very dry. I WON\'T come back again :( ... 
Sometimes it\'s more important to have a few true friends rather than a ton of friends. And thank you for being true 🙆 // Nothing fantastic about the food here though affordable. My flat white was disastrous be it the taste and appearance. #wheremylatteart
I must say this cake is really photogenic in many angles hahaha ~ probably one of the best i tried so far , even though is a little bit sweet , but i have a sweet tooth anyways xD! Maybe they could have a dark chocolate or maybe something sour ones to reduce the sweetness. Located just at a community club, i guess its quite reasonable for a 8sgd cake. Thanks @gxgxgx94 for the \"surprise\" hahaha ;p #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #dessertporn
NOM Bistro and Bakery has got to be one of the very few cafes opened at a community club. Its signature Rainbow Cake has been the star of many Instagram pictures which has definitely induced drool from any self loving person. 
when life in greyscale and seems no other meaning, look for the rainbow and smile. definitely one of the better rainbow cakes i tasted. generous serving for a slice and comes in 4 different flavors. my cookie butter was a delish! right dense without being too saccharine sweet. if only their coffee was as good as their rainbow cakes, it would be perfect.
Rainbow cake with Oreo buttercream in the front, and salted caramel buttercream at the back plus one rainbow cheesecake by the side. Unfortunately, they were definitely prettier to look at than they were tasty. At $7.90 a slice, it isn\'t cheap, and while rainbow cakes are all the rage these days, the cakes themselves were pretty nondescript and were run-of-the-mill. The rainbow cakes tasted slightly artificial and the buttercream left a slick and oily aftertaste. The cheesecake, while better than the other two, is nothing to rave about. The hunt for good rainbow cakes continues. 
I didn\'t like the butter cream used for the rainbow cakes. Had a stale plastic like taste to me. The flavour of the salted caramel was alright, as was the Oreo. The cake layers were well made, not dry or dense. The cheese cake wasn\'t the best, the cheese could have been lighter and the base more fragrant. Overall, I did not enjoy the cakes here. 
Cakes here was a dissapointment that i think i won\'t be back here anymore. 
Loving my new Paros strap (thanks to Mr Goh\'s recommendation from K2 Watches) on my Seiko Baby Monster. Went to NOM Bistro N Bakery as it was near the area and was pleasantly delighted by the Oreo Rainbow Cake. A good start to the holidays. 
Really no other meaning ?! Nom platter is freaking great (^O^)／ #noothermeaning #nomster #rainbowcheesecake @apk1981 @sheronronn @vonntee @m3rvync   @junjun 😉😋😍👍😱
Order half half as we wanted to try both fav. We both agreed chili beef is nicer. 
Early birds get the worm. This cafe is already packed at 12pm! I especially like their truffle fries. Recommended!
Rainbow cakes sold out fast, wanted to try the salted caramel though. However it wasnt available at the moment. Choco was kind of thick but overall not too bad 😋
Cake is delightfully colourful, and not too sweet. Rated 9/10. Ambience is bright and not too noisy. Awesome awesome place. 
Rosti with bacon, cheesy sausage and sunny side up! Totally like how the rosti is done, crisp on the outer and soft in the inner. Totally a good replacement of the usual muffin, brioche etc.
Bacon and egg pizza and smoked duck pizza! ($15.90) LOVE the handrolled pizza! The crust was really just perfect, not too soggy and yet crispy on the edges. Bacon and eggs was the winner between the two! Steak wasn\'t impressive and I thought it was pretty steep at $19.90 being so mediocre.
One of the prettiest rainbow cakes I\'ve ever had! The caramel sauce was nice but I felt that the rainbow layers were quite dense and hard. 
One of the fluffier and moist cakes I\'ve tasted!! Cake size complements the price paid for (~$7-$8) and this cafe has really nice ambience and is situated inside a community center! how convenient and cool is that! definitely must try if you\'re looking to chill and hang out with your friends over some cakes
Located in the heartland is this NOM Bistro and Bakery that provides convenience to the people staying around the area. What\'s more, it located in a community center and simply flash your PAssion card to enjoy 10% off your total bill. The rainbow cake comes in 3 different flavours, salted caramel, oreo and chocolate. Since the salted caramel version wasn\'t available in most places, I decided to give it a go and didn\'t regret it. The sweetness is not too overwhelming and the colours are pleasing to the eyes. This definitely makes a good afternoon tea.
Nice place, cold, with music, clean, food and service is fast, just a place to relax, chill, they even open at night and have beers
Was here for the rainbow cake. 2nd time there, finally managed to get the oreo rainbow cake cause the salted caramel rainbow cake was sold out. Rather moist, but still a tad too sweet. Couldn\'t finish the cake. Ordered chicken skins and OMG! It\'s awesome!! The bacon and egg pizza was very nice as well. I had always liked thin crust pizza, and despite the runny egg, the pizza is not soggy at all. Instead, the egg actually complements the whole pizza. The ribs was not too bad as well. I decided to be adventurous and ordered a Yuzu Pear tea. Wrong choice. It tasted like cough syrup. I would go back again for the salted caramel rainbow cake and of course, the chicken skins!
Always wanted to try this everyone\'s raving about! Takeaway their Salted Caramel Buttercream Rainbow Cake. Definitely owned the other Rainbow Cakes around as this comes in different flavours. A pity the Chocolate Rainbow was sold out. Would love to try it next time!
Located just at the ground level of macpherson\'s community club. The beer battered fish burger, truffle fries and rainbow cake is awesome!!!!!
Presentation of food is nice! The dishes are quite filling, just right for a meal. Especially their fish &amp; chips($12.9); a fat dory fish😅. Personal love for the smoked salmon salad($8.9) &amp; mashed potato drizzled with cranberry sauce!(sour&amp;sweet
One of the most moist and tasty rainbow cakes I\'ve eaten! Peanut butter chocolate cake was dense and rich, great for the first few mouths but got a bit too much after that. Sweet potato fries are worth a mention too! This hidden cafe is a great find, if only it wasn\'t so far from the nearest train station. | ★★★★★
Menu stated handmade but it tasted pretty instant. Quite generous w their ingredients though. 
Wanted the salted caramel one badly but missed it by abit cos they still have it but it\'s sold. ): Called earlier but they dont offer t reserve either. 
Not the best rainbow cake tasted cause it was d last piece. I would love to come here again to try other cakes :)
Cake was moist and dense. Butter cream could do better with more salted caramel infused in it. They could think of spreading thin layers of salted caramel and then spreading the butter cream for every layer 
Nice ambience and if you go at a time where there aren\'t many customers it makes your cafe visit a good experience. Quiet is what I would say about mine. Was a little worried that it would be noisy as there is a playground and that it is a child friendly cafe. Love their customized serving plates for their cakes. Makes me want to have one of my own 
I was sold the moment I saw a smoked duck salad on the menu. I will choose this over smoked salmon salad any day. Love the sauce which I can\'t remember now what it is. I will be sure to order this when I come back. They could probably offer more smoked duck slices perhaps? But at $7.90 what can I expect right?
This is my favourite out of the 3 flavours. 
I\'M SOLD. The cake is not only pretty, but very yummy too. A must try if you visit them! They also have it in Salted Caramel and Chocolate versions.
I had the Oreo flavored one, and I\'ll definitely be back to try out the chocolate and salted caramel flavor! Omnomnom!
The most unique rainbow cake I\'ve had thus far, would love to try the salted caramel one though! What a refreshing change from the usual cream cheese!
Delicious cake. It was fluffy and soft without being overly sweet! Bought a slice for my parents and they like it too~
Sells really affordable cafe food! Brunch menus only on the weekends. Highly recommended: Lemon earl grey cheesecake, 100% beef NOM burger, rainbow cake
PB chocolate cake and salted caramel rainbow cake. Pretty decent cakes that are super photogenic. They served grounded pleasures iced chocolates. Yummm my fave brand so far. Hehe. Service have to improve though. No one came to serve or sit us. And when asked about cakes/food/drinks staff doesn\'t seem happy explaining. Sigh.  
😀 Was initially quite hesitant to try this cos I thought it\'ll look better than it\'ll taste, but luckily it wasn\'t that bad!\n<br />• Review posted on the blog •\n<br />#burpple
There was only the oreo flavour left for the rainbow cakes available when we got there on a Sunday evening, but it tasted really good! Not just creamy cakes looks good from the outside, but fluffy well-done flavoured cakes. The earl grey cheesecake was so well done too, the cheese was pretty thick! It\'s good to go with the Caromilie tea. I\'ll certainly visit again!
If you like it sweet and savouy, this will make a perfect fit. 😋👍🍗
Nobody wants pain. But you can\'t have a rainbow, without a little rain. 😊
This is such a cosy and sweet place. The menu is very interesting - creative and unique. Will be back for more.
Chocolate Rainbow Cake. It\'s really for photo-shooting purpose! Price: S$8++
Yes,second rainbow cake this week. Who cares, #justfatonly eating this while the baker was making this while I peeped through the glass. #peepingraine
Top up $2 from normal fries to tuffled ones and this is a must try here! Ribs are flavourful and soft!
My pretty high tea
Really yummy! Pair it with coffee or tea to balance the sweetness.
Pizza flavours- smoked salmon with sour cream and smoked duck &amp; Beef Burger 
Cafe found at  Macpherson  CC. Will be back to try their main course...

Still my favourite coffee.
Beef nicely done but the dressing kinda oily for me. 
Love the flexibility of being able to choose a combination of 2 different flavors for only $17.90! ( bacon &amp; egg with BBQ teriyaki chicken)
And paying $9.90 isn\'t really a good deal. Though it\'s really good fries, its definitely not truffle fries. #truffle #truffles #trufflefries #fries #fried #parmesan #cheese #truffleoil
Always good to have a beer after a long day. And tomorrow is Friday!!! #beer #kirin #kirinbeer #kirinsg #work #dinner #kirinichiban
I am not a fan of cheesecake but the thick coffee and the candied caramel are enticing enough
One of my favorite places for rainbow cakes in Singapore. 
It tasted slightly better when dipped in Thai sweet chilli, but the batter\'s really bland and unappetizing.
This is one of the WORSE soup we ever had. \n<br />Totally bland and tasteless, I reckon Campbell soup taste even better. Totally horrible!
This is decently good, but the cream sauce is kinda diluted. In fact, this is already the best dish among the lot we ordered.
Despite this, the cake was rather soft.
This is their Breakfast Rosti which i have been going back for!
Just looking at this brightly colored cake makes Sundays 😊 .
(#randomsong LOL) Rainbows are my fave!!! 🙆💗💛💜💙💚 Chocolate, Cheesecake &amp; Salted Caramel FTW!!! 🍰🌈 #rainbowcakesg #rainbowcake #rainbow #cake #sweet #yummy #delicious #saltedcaramel #chocolate #cheesecake

NOM is famous for it\'s rainbow cake and it\'s $8.90 for each slice. Ordered the caramel and oreo rainbow cake and it\'s really yummy. The fries (mixed herb taste) came in a large serving for just $3.90.
Yummy and pretty, best of both worlds
Can\'t say the same for this rainbow cake though.
A variety of rainbow cakes to select from. Offers snack bites and more. 
Thanks @toshirosg for making it for me haha 😸😸😻😻

Icy foam beer to cool off the hot day. 
Still prefer the one at backstage cafe though! 🙊😊\n<br />#Foodphotography 🍰
The salted caramel rainbow cake didn\'t taste as good as i expected. Macaron was okay. Lemon earl grey cheesecake got very light earl grey taste. Can only taste more of lemon. 
Beer battered fish &amp; chips were rather good. Half &amp; half pizza was okay. Truffle fries were so-so too. 
Decent food at decent prices!
Crispy and tender wings!
Beautiful cake, beautiful taste. Perfect ending to a hearty dinner.
