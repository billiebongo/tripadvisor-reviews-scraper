On one hand, I\'m whining why I don\'t work near TTK, on the other I\'m glad my office is further away so that I won\'t be tempted with good and cheap food😝
Too many things in one frame to name. But my picks at this super duper value-for-money canteen are the $2 pumpkin cake and the Assam curry Maggi noodles.
Lip-smacking Hainanese Curry Rice with assorted side dishes.  So loving the rice as it is practically drenched in curry.
The cake pieces are pan-fried till the sides turn crispy and golden brown, which is the way I love to eat these traditional cakes.  I also relish the idea that I can have a bit of everything without having to agonise which type of cake to choose.  This plate of golden goodness is priced only at an unbelievable $2.00!  I will definitely be back for more. 😊
Finally had a chance to visit to truly test kitchen. 🙌\n<br />-\n<br />A hidden hip-hawker-gem run by youngsters. No wonder they know what youngsters needs -- cheap and good food [more like everyone\'s fav, huh? 😂] Honestly, I\'ve always liked my waffle classic -- hot, crispy-fluffy, with mapple syrup. Never thought it works with fried chicken and fries on top too!! 💕💕💕 will definitely come back. [Also cause It\'s only 5 bus stops away 😁]\n<br />-\n<br />Personal thought, share this plate of wonder. Might not look like it, but it\'s A LOT. 🙈\n<br />-\n<br />🍴 Chicken&amp; waffle\n<br />🍵 Teh Bing siew dai 💰 S$4.50 + S$1.00\n<br />🏠 Truly Test Kitchen\n<br />📍 Jun Jie Industrial Building 153 Kampong Ampat [07-05] Singapore 368326\n<br />🕒 mon-sat 7am-3pm
Like this bowl of Assam noodles. For $3.50, you get a generous bowl of maggi noodles with minced pork in tangy assam soup. #valueformoney
Come for an early lunch with your colleagues in tow and have Truly Test Kitchen\'s signature Hainanese Curry Rice (average $4, depending on the dishes you pick — you must get the deep-fried pork cutlet), along with other budget friendly dishes like the Sambal Spaghetti ($3.50) and homemade Yam or Pumpkin Cake ($2). Portion sizes are very generous and excellent value considering the prices, which explains the crazy lunch crowds.
After resting for 3 days, it\'s back to the daily grind again😫 Really wish that Truly Test Kitchen is at the canteen of my workplace, cheap and big portion food everyday😛 Peanut / Century Egg Porridge only at S$2, Minced Pork / Minced Beef / Chicken Ball Porridge S$3.
Ta-da!! It was on the house! Thank you @mrjoelchia for your generosity! The kuehs were xiang and still hot even after completing our mains! Crispy on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside. Swee lah! 👍🏼 #trulytestkitchen #먹스타그램 #burpple
They also have pumpkin and radish cake, all of which are available for just $2 for a huge serving. You can even have a mixed platter if you\'d like. The cakes are displayed in metal trays, and are freshly cut and fried a la minute. Albeit a little out of the way, and rather poorly ventilated, you won\'t regret a trip to @trulytestkitchen.
Carrot cake for [$2]. Yes you heard me right. Only $2! This is TRULY a steal. Located at the 7th storey of Jun Jie Industrial Building, they offer many other dishes like curry rice, noodles, Western. People working/staying nearby can drop by and give it a try. 153 Kampong Ampat.
For lovers of spice, this will not fail you, trust me. Every bite will cause you to break out in drips of perspiration, but it is all well worth it.
Even if you wanna eat Maggie mee also must eat one with generous serving of liao aka ingredients 😁😁😁
Love the tangy assam curry taste! 😋👌🏻 But I need some icy cold drink just to have this. Not that it\'s very spicy, but because the weather is too hot. 😅
Me think it\'s the truly test kitchen\'s pasta in chicken curry cream sauce. It\'s spicy, it\'s aromatic, it\'s affordable at SGD 3.50 and best of all, it\'s great tasting! It\'s good deal, it\'s good value, it\'s appetizing and it\'s pleasing to my palate and wallet too :)
After all the raves about this place, had to go try it for myself and the homely assam noodles sure didn\'t disappoint. But beware, the place is ulu max and really really really warm 🌞🌞🌞. I think i just had a shower before and after eating the noodles 😂 
😍 Love the generous chunks of pumpkin within! 👍🏻 Not to mention its priced at just $2 per plate. Such a steal eh? Other options include yam and radish which are just as good too! 👍🏻 .\n<br />.\n<br />Currently onsite at #suntannest! Today\'s the first day of our reno and we have just hacked down the kitchen wall! I\'m so excited!!! 😆 Follow me on Dayre for my home reno journey~ 😉
You cannot find something this decent, for this price, anywhere else in Singapore.
[Homemade Traditional Yam Cake S$2] is freshly fried upon ordering, so crispy good! There is also carrot cake and pumpkin cake on the menu.
Back to Truly Test Kitchen for all these homemade babies!!! The yam cake, carrot cake and pumpkin cake are all freshly made and fried ala minute for that crispy golden encasing!! Love that chunks of yam found in the yam cake!! Oh my tian!!! Why so good!?\n<br />@janelkuuu you r missingout on something great!\n<br />Enjoy 10% discount when you spent $5 at Truly Test Kitchen. Simply download @holler.out and key in \"mshannahchia\" on the app. But then again this plate of golden babies is only $2 so I reckon you would spend more than $5. 😂😂😂
This incredible yam-packed treat has a slightly crisp exterior with a soft interior, made more fragrant and tasty with garnishings of fried shallots, spring onions, and lashings of sweet sauce!
Can\'t resist good &amp; cheap hawker food 😍✨ ($14 for everything pictured)
If you have been missing out and looking for real food as part of your food hunt, don\'t miss this one out. Find the place too ulu? Take a cab along with your friends cause the food is definitely worth that extra penny you are paying for your cab!
Loving the carrot cake and the curry rice. Good food need to be enjoyed with good company. \n<br />Cheers to the weekend everyone.
Satisfying for only $4.50!!! And actually filling enough for me. waffles were decent, Chicken wasn\'t crispy enough but wasn\'t greasy, pretty good for its price. Partner wasn\'t feeling the maple syrup tho.
Evidently still in my waffle season. Pretty certain this is one of the cheapest Belgian waffles you can find these days. Not forgetting the huge portion of fries that comes along with it. Seriously, 这么划算去哪里找？！The chicken was cooked just right. Neither oily nor salty. + No thick layer of fats that scream atherosclerosis in your face &amp; make you feel all self conscious. (Disclaimer: the author accepts no responsibility for your health if you decide to have this everyday.) Also, had the value lunch set that includes a choice of protein, carb, side, &amp; sauce. Not a huge fan of any we picked except the curry sauce. But at this price point, Truly Test already outperformed. There was a camera crew filming when we were there so we had our 1 minute of fame while ordering food in the background hahaha. Bonus: You can also head down to Hock Siong &amp; Co. (on the 1st floor of the same building) after your meal to uncover funky secondhand furniture.
With well-marinated meatballs adding on additional flavours to the distinctively fragrant-rich broth (not too thick nor diluted) – the textures of the mee hoon mee (yellow noodles with rice vermicelli) &amp; napa cabbage overall gave us the shiok factor that superseded our expectations.\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 4.1/5\n<br />#TrulyTestKitchen operates from Monday to Saturday, 7am – 2.30pm at 153 Kampong Ampat, 07-05, Jun Jie Industrial Building\n<br />✨ Feel free to quote  on the #HollerOut App to easily enjoy 10% off anytime you spend a minimum of $5!\n<br />📷 Credits: @blancheeze

Brilliant! Worth it! you can hardly find a gem like this place! must be on the cheap and good list! 
Food with integrity that are delivered with love &amp; pride. Such beliefs were so much more common in the past considering they were pioneered by the older generation hawkers, &amp; that’s something you don’t get to see nowadays.\n<br />Serving a plethora of homely blast from the past dishes (Curry Rice, Homemade Noodles, Porridge, Yam/Carrot/Pumpkin Cake, Western &amp; Drinks), I’m genuinely glad to know that this place is continuing the great food value while preserving the dying hawker trade in Singapore.\n<br />Don’t forget to quote  on the @Holler.Out App to easily enjoy 10% off your bill!

Pictured here is curry rice with 4 ingredients - taupok, tofu, veg and har cheong gai chicken chop. \n<br />You\'d think that it would\'ve cost a bomb, but with a price tag of $3.90, it\'s a real steal. Generous portions and amazing food — the only thing not to love would be how difficult it is to find this place. \n<br />Situated on the 7th floor of Jun Jie Industrial building, a 10-15min walk away from Tai Seng MRT!

It reminds me of those Hainanese hawker/coffee shop that makes one feel like home ☺️ My Favourite dish has to be the traditional carrot &amp; yam cake that is made fresh every morning! 😍 Besides that, Truly Test Kitchen also has a wide variety of food ranging from their signature Curry Rice to Chicken &amp; Waffle [$4.50] •\n<br />Anyway!! 💡Get 10% off when you spend more than $5 at Truly Test Kitchen by downloading the @holler.out app and entering the code \"cake.cass\" ENJOY!\n<br />•\n<br />Many thanks to Joel &amp; Deniece for hosting this tasting and @blancheeze for the invite! ☺️ #trulytestkitchen (opps accidentally deleted this post haiz 😅)
Housing 5 unique stalls serving hipster hawker affair, this modern coffeeshop located at Level 7 of Jun Jie Industrial Building (Tai Seng) presents to us a unique interplay of past, present &amp; future local food culture:\n<br />• Curry Rice ($1/Dish)\n<br />• Curry Noodles ($3.50)\n<br />• Traditional Yam / Carrot / Pumpkin Cake ($2)\n<br />• Chicken Waffle ($4.50)
(On the other hand, it\'s rather cooling 😌) My Favourite was strangely the Assam ($3) one, where the soup was spicy yet slightly sourish and creamier(?) which went really well with your usual Maggie noodles and very easy to eat.
Handmade on a daily basis, these yam/radish &amp; pumpkin cakes are fried freshly on the spot! Crispy on the outside, soft &amp; smooth on the inside, pair it with the chilli (which is super shiok 🌶🌶) &amp; the black sweet sauce, you\'ve got yourself a hearty breakfast! \n<br />A hosted meal by the people from Truly Test Kitchen &amp; @rainraineeataway for extending the invite!
Basic, down-to-earth, blanket-comforting food such as their version of homely noodles (curry or assam base), curry rice, carrot/yam/pumpkin cake, aglio olio, fried chicken with waffles and porridge with homemade meatballs. Bring an empty stomach when you\'re there as portions are huge yet affordable.
Each of them were truly delicious and you need not test your pockets for it 😹 \n<br />Think $3 mountainous curry rice, $3 bottomless Assam Noodles or $4.50 juicy Chicken Waffles and not forgetting that $2 big plate of carrot cake 😋
The congee like consistency reminded me so much of what I used to have at Old Airport Road when I was a little kid - simple yet comforting. The couple behind Truly Test Kitchen definitely did this right 😌 \n<br />Thank you @rainraineeataway for extending the invite &amp; Joel &amp; Denise for hosting &amp; feeding us! \n<br />#burpple #burppletastemakers #trulytestkitchen

This whole table of food(+ fried chicken waffle) for 5 of us. I cannot say that this is the best curry rice I had, BUT it is definitely the most economical! That huge bowl of curry noodles(bottom right) with generous amount of meat balls and napa cabbage only cost $3.50!My favourite of the curry rice dishes would be the super flavorful braised pork belly!Nothing to complain given that the pricing is really affordable! For people working in Tai Seng or Macpherson area, do give this a try! #EileenFoodTasting #JiakLocal #TrulyTestKitchen #CurryRice #YourSingaporeFood #CheapAndGood #Hawker #Burpple #BurppleSg #SupportLocal\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />*Good to end the meal with apple pie sake. 😁✌🏻️
The young hawkers behind Telok Blangah’s Truly Curry Rice have moved into the seventh-floor canteen in Jun Jie Industrial Building, about a 10-minute walk from Tai Seng MRT. You will find their signature Hainanese Curry Rice (average $4, depending on the dishes you pick — you must get the deep-fried pork cutlet), along with other incredibly budget-friendly lunchtime eats like Curry Noodles ($3.50), Chicken Chop ($4.50), homemade Yam or Pumpkin Cake ($2) and a star discovery — Chicken and Waffles ($4.50). Portion sizes are very generous and excellent value considering the prices, which explains the crazy lunch crowds. Come by for an early lunch at about 11am instead, so you can eat in relative peace.
At Truly Test Kitchen located at Jun Jie Industrial Building, the dream is real, along with other western dishes, local fare and Truly\'s beloved curry rice, all at value-for-money prices! A great place to consider when you\'re on a tight budget yet want a good variety of options to choose from! 😉
Fried chicken over a piece of waffles and fries. Comes with \'mushroom kind of sauce\' and maple syrup. Less than $5!!
|\n<br />A \"common\" western dish but at a very affordable price. The sweet syrupy with crispy chicken and waffle will never go wrong! It\'s amount was able to feed two hungry people.
Just a plate of pork chop and chap chye is good enough when you are having a good plate of curry rice. The pork chop is deep fried in light batter leaving it moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.
|\n<br />Golden crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. The taste of the yam and pumpkin were noticed but I still find it bland. If there was some  Chinese sausage or Chinese preserved belly into the cake mixture. It\'s flavors will be multiply by the lard.
|\n<br />No MSG, no extra oats. Traditional Cantonese style congee which need to simmer for hours to achieve this thick texture. The owner said he only used water and rice for the base. However, I could believe it because it tasted too good. The chicken balls were flavors-packed.
|\n<br />Everyday they will used 2kg of soy beans and 5 kg of Ikan bilis to create this tasty broth. Added large amount of cabbage to increase its sweetness. The hand made meat balls and fried shallots completed this bowl of simple eat.
|\n<br />Despite of the Korean-spicy-noodle look, it tasted totally like curry Mee. The spicy was just right and great for a rainy day. Well balanced between the broth and the noodle. If not because of the rest of food, we will slurped the entire bowl.
|\n<br />All this started from a humble beginning of a plate of curry rice. The owners took over the staff canteen at Jun Jie Industrial and converted into a mini kopitiam. Consist of 4 different stalls - congee stall, noodle stall, western and their curry rice. .\n<br />|\n<br />Everyday the staff will start with at 3plus in the morning and started to prepare the delicious eats. We could feel the passion from their cooking but maybe the potion can be readjust.
Will make these together with my grandma, and she will pan-fry (sometimes) after steaming.
Is this the cheapest Chicken Waffles in Singapore or what? \n<br />The owner wanted to keep cost lower for his loyal customers, acknowledging that this canteen is hard to find, on the 7th level of Jun Jie Industrial Building.
If you need something more comforting (think late night after a long day at work and you are served with a bowl of hot curry noodles with vegetables and meat), then go for the curry version that is sure to make you snuggle in bed nicely after the meal. At the same time, why not also get a plate of their homemade carrot, yam and pumpkin cake ($2). Beware lunch kakis, you do not want your boss to catch you dozing off from the food coma.
Lao Jiao Bloggers. LOL. Actually I still consider myself as SJ Sin Jiao. \n<br />We got to know one another through food tastings many years back. During those days, there weren\'t many. Suddenly there were many, too many. And I chose not to go to media tastings since end 2014, in an attempt to protect my weight, sanity and email inbox. \n<br />Happy to meet good old @rubbisheatrubbishgrow @gninethree @sgfoodonfoot @pinkypiggu @kimberleyyeo @camemberu Has been a long time. \n<br />Even though the place is quite ulu, and cab brought me round the island... We found the meal affordable and heart-warming. Will come back again, provided I can find transport and kaki. \n<br />Thank you for waiting for me.
It\'s so heartening to see that our hawker culture is alive and flourishing as more and more people are willing to go into this trade. Taking over the canteen space at Jun Jie Industrial Building, Deniece, Joel and Joshua renovated it into a modern coffeeshop serving traditional comfort fare. I am absolutely not kidding you when our lunch for the 3 of us cost only $11.50 ($9.50 for curry rice and $2 for a mixture of carrot, yam and pumpkin cake). What truly stands out is the down-to-earth homely spread of dishes such as the braised radish, braised cabbage and pork cutlet. The homemade carrot, yam and pumpkin cake comes in a big portion, fit for sharing with a big group. I highly recommend you drown the rice in the curry gravy before the actual feasting. Trust me, we will definitely be back for more.

Really affordable curry rice at $4 for such a huge plate. The curry is suitable for people who cannot take spicy food, and unlike many other places, the pork chop has more meat than flour and did not taste too oily. The long beans however were a tad too salty, but the highlight for me was the cabbage cooked till soft and fragrant 😋😋 #burpple#burpplesg#burpplesghawkerfare#taiseng#trulytestkitchen#curry#curryrice#porkchop#cabbage#longbeans#tslmakan#8dayseat#whati8today#onthetable#sgig#exploresingapore#sgfoodie#sgfood#sgfoodsnaps#roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition #STfoodtrending #BurppleCheapNGood
When a Monday happens to be a non-working day, that can only mean... it\'s Food Hunting day! 😁 
Situated at the 7th storey of Jun Jie Industrial Building with generous portion and affordable price, yes this place is worth a try!
Most of the food here are priced between $1-$4.50, and they are all pretty decent. Do go around 11am as most food will be ready only then, and i have heard that on some days, some of the food will he sold out at around 1pm.\n<br />Rating : 🌝🌝🌝🌝\n<br />Sgw Contributor : @caegumpy\n<br />.\n<br />Truly Test Kitchen\n<br />Address: 153 Kampong Ampat #07-05, Singapore 368326\n<br />Parking along kampong ampat coupon or Jun Jie Building\n<br />.\n<br />Opening Hours: \n<br />Mon to Sat 7am to 2.30pm\n<br />Closed on Sundays\n<br />.\n<br />#sgwanderlust #sgkopitiam #sglunch #sgfood #sgeats #sgfoodie #sgmondays #sgig #igsg #singapore #food #foodie #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #igfood #foodpic #wanderlust #instagood #instadaily #burpple #sgchinese
It was a hearty breakfast with a large serving of curry beehoon topped with chicken cutlet, braised pork and cabbage.\n<br />They are really generous with their servings but maybe they should consider optional free upgrade to such big portions upon request.

Chicken............ Waffles......... Now.........
grab your pair of chopsticks and dig in.
Finally had a chance to visit to truly test kitchen. 🙌\n<br />-\n<br />A hidden hip-hawker-gem run by youngsters. No wonder they know what youngsters needs -- cheap and good food [more like everyone\'s fav, huh? 😂] Honestly, I\'ve always liked my waffle classic -- hot, crispy-fluffy, with mapple syrup. Never thought it works with fried chicken and fries on top too!! 💕💕💕 will definitely come back. [Also cause It\'s only 5 bus stops away 😁]\n<br />-\n<br />Personal thought, share this plate of wonder. Might not look like it, but it\'s A LOT. 🙈\n<br />-\n<br />🍴 Chicken&amp; waffle\n<br />🍵 Teh Bing siew dai 💰 S$4.50 + S$1.00\n<br />🏠 Truly Test Kitchen\n<br />📍 Jun Jie Industrial Building 153 Kampong Ampat [07-05] Singapore 368326\n<br />🕒 mon-sat 7am-3pm\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />#vscofood #sgig #sgfoodies #foodspotting #foodreview #instagramsg #burpple #eatoutsg #singapore #exploresingapore

The generous serving of dried shrimp sambal definitely brought the heat to the body. \n<br />So glad that they kept the prices low and attractive, this big plate being only at $3.50. \n<br />Truly my highly recommended kitchen. #burpple #foodporn #sgfoodies #singaporefood #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgmakandiaries #supportlocalsg #trulytestkitchen #samble #pasta #fusion
At $4.50! 👍🏼
you dip with chilli or sweet sauce. crispy on the outside, soft on de inside.
|| good for the penny pinchers as this seemingly bottomless bowl of curry noodles fills the stomach with so much gratification without punishing the wallet with its $3.50 price tag. Get in on the deep fried yam cake action for only $1.50 if you quote \'Flawed\' on the @holler.out app. #dontsayibojio ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●\n<br />#sgfoodporn#jiaklocal#taisengEats#instafood_sg#eatoutsg#burpple#hungrygowhere#8dayseat#sipandgulp#trulytestkitchen#taisengEats#eyecandySorted
The young hawkerpreneurs here have whipped up a delicious, righteous Chinese curry, thick and savoury sweet! \n<br />Large, filling portions and super affordable prices mean it\'s really cheap and good!
Thankful for friends who shares the joy! Featuring hawker fare at really reasonable prices. Only down side is the ulu (isolated) location.
😍 And, what a hot Saturday!
Curry Peng with all the trimmings.  Hope everyone is having a great Saturday afternoon ahead!\n<br />♡♡♡♡\n<br />#sgfoodporn#jiaklocal#instafood_sg#trulytestkitchen#curryrice#burpple#hungrygowhere#sipandgulp#singaporeinsiders

I really liked the crispy chicken cutlet with the syrup! The waffle has a slight saltiness to it and it paired well with the sweetness of the syrup! 🙌 model : @jellylovefats

I felt waffles was dense and doughy while the taste of chicken was okay. But was not used to the maple syrup on the chicken.\n<br />Thank you @jellylovefats and Truly Test for the invite.\n<br />#tasting #waffles #burpple #openricesg #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #stfoodtrending #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodies #bloggersg

Located on level seven of the industrial building, Truly Test Kitchen is a concept that consists of Truly Curry Rice, and another 3 other stalls - Truly Western, Mian and Handmade Meatball Porridge.
// it\'s a case of \'got fried chicken cutlet for curry rice, will make chicken and waffle \' over at the Western food stall in #TrulyTestKitchen. No wonder these guys can keep the cost so low!\n<br />♡♡♡\n<br />Verdict: Chicken is exactly what\'s it\'s supposed to be. Bone-in chicken thigh smashed and fried til\' concedingly golden brown. The pertinent edges of skin forming crispy crackers, perfect for dunking into extra curry (if your partner has chosen the curry rice route). The waffle is the usual sort,  a BP raised fella with a mild crisp edge when hot; resolving itself to a limp and mediocre state when the temperature drops. It can be resurrected though, with generous drizzles of maple syrup. Still, for $4.50, you get your money\'s worth - not to mention the mountain load of fries accompanying the lead\n<br />♡♡♡\n<br />Quote my promo code \'Flawed\' when using the @holler.out\n<br />App to enjoy 10% off your bill (min. spending $5) ♡♡♡\n<br />#eatoutsg #trulycurryrice #instafood_sg #jiaklocal #singaporeinsiders #taisengEats #sipandgulp #burpple #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #vscofood #chickenandwaffles #eyecandySorted
Open stunningly early at 7am for breakfast, #TrulyTestKitchen gets all the chops for being real hardworking young chaps in the kitchen.  Churning out delicious heartwarming fare such as this traditional delicacy at enormously affordable pricing. $3.50 for that. Hell yeh, I\'ll take it\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />Quote my special promo on the @Holler.Out app to enjoy 10% off your bill with a min. spending of $5. My strong recommendations goes out to the yam cake and that curry chicken noodles.\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />#eatoutsg #jiaklocal #sgfoodporn #hollerout #trulycurryrice #instafood_sg #singaporeinsiders #sipandgulp #8dayseat #burpple
Sure thing, food here pinches only a little at the wallet and fills the stomach cavity with so much gratification,  that I dare say, even my pre-5 year self - jaded and wrecked by pastry kitchen circumstances would be enlivened by this lunch stop\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />On the table today, the overspilling generosity of Joel and Deniece well exhibited through Curry Chicken Chop Noodles, 干捞面，牛内碎粥 and 咖喱饭. My favourite of the lot being the homemade yam cake which I painstakingly chopped, steamed and freshly battered and pan fried everyday. That\'s dedication right there\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />#whati8today #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders #8dayseat #TrulyTestKitchen #hollerout #eyecandySorted
😋Huge portions for the western dishes - chicken aglio olio, fried chicken waffle, and homely curry noodles. Satisfy your tummy for $5 or less !
Yummy \n<br />#eatoutsg#trulytestkitchen#instapic#instagood#foodphotography#throwback#foodpics#instamood#yummy#instafood#foodie#foodporn#whati8today#burpple#potd
It caused some ponding but no one is complaining though. 😂👍
Had Lor Bak, Pork Chop (very yummy) and Bitter Gourd (very home cook style). $4.50 and portions are huge.
Their baked rice is more towards the Hong Kong style. Perhaps it\'s the batter, I must say their Chicken Chop is really good, hence be it we had it by itself or as Chicken Chop Baked Rice, both were equally satisfying.

only here on the 7th floor of truly test kitchen.
A value for money meal indeed. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #trulytestkitchen #chickenchop #hawker #hawkerfood
Thick and gluey, this hearty porridge is slow cooked for 2 hours to achieve such consistency. Hence, you wouldn\'t see your porridge turning watery till your last drop. That happens when potato starch was being added to quicken the thickening process. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #porridge #meatball #trulytestkitchen
They are slightly differently from the usual. Crispy on the outside soft on the inside, the special sauce and chilli at the side make it extra moreish.
you\'ll get 10% off!
Chicken is freshly fried upon order and super juicy. Just wish they had more vegetables on the menu.
