Not in the mood for long gu, so I ordered a bowl of sliced pork belly instead. We are in the midst of planning something big and it\'s gonna be super exciting! Can\'t wait to share more with everyone. :)
seriously shiok. and they top up your soup automatically! (for the first 2 times anyway) 
To all my Malaysian Comrades that always jeer on Singapore bak kut teh, one suggestion, just don\'t take this as our herbal bak kut teh, because its not. Take it as pork garlic pepper soup! You might actually enjoy this dish! Just like me now. 
Bak kut teh!!! Not song fa, but this will do for now :D
I simply love bak ku teh and sea cucumber; they are all so different and yet so delicious together. Tender and off-the-bone pork rib; thick and flavourful soup with sea cucumber. Also don\'t miss Signature dragon pork rib soup, homemade fried prawn roll (my mummy\'s favourite) and organic beancurd.\n<br />.\n<br />Sea Cucumber Pork Rib Soup at S$17.50.\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine? \n<br />Rong Cheng Bak Kut Teh\n<br />Blk 26 Sin Ming Lane, #01-114 Midview City, 573971\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#RongCheng #BakKutTeh #porkrib #seacucumber #souplover #chinesefood #bishan #amk

It\'s been so long since we last ate #bahkutteh outside because my mum can make a mean one too.\n<br />.\n<br />This stall at Sin Ming has been around for decades and we used to go very often as my workplace was nearby.  The peppery soup is fiery enough yet thankfully doesn\'t give me heartburn.  The very tender and fresh 猪肝腰子 is not to be missed too!  The only thing we didn\'t order was the 梅菜 cos we prefer kiam chye beh to go with BKT 😂\n<br />.\n<br />We enjoyed the meal so much that we tabao-ed another trotter for dinner.  Hubby forgot to ask for lean trotter and we brought home a super fatty full-of-collagen piece. 😂😂\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #SGParentBloggers  #instafood #instafoodie #instagood  #sgigfoodies #foodporn #foodaddict #whati8today #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgigers #foodcoma #nomnomnomnom\n<br />#foodshare #instadaily #sgfoodunion #yummy #yumyum #tastyshoutouts #delicious #foodpics #foods\n<br />#hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #openricesg #sgmakandiaries

白进火,茶友聚会 Wednesday breakfast session with old Tea Buddies hosted by 白新春茶庄 Pek Sin Choon Pte Ltd\'s boss Mr. Kenry Bai for many umpteen years before I was invited by Eng Kiat to join them.  My 1st visit to this wonderful group of tea buddies was on 03 Apr 2013. #peksinchoon #bktbreakfast #bkt #breakfast #rongchengbkt #22sinmingroad #teasession #chinesetea #teabuddies #burpple
What I like is it can still maintain its crusty structure without being over flaky and disintegrate like most others do :)\n<br />#himheang #tausarpiah #buns #chinesepastry #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Uncle Lim has specially cooked old school rickshaw noodles and it\'s the best version yours truly have tried. Clear broth enhanced by the addition of dried shrimps and homemade meat balls with water chestnuts give it so much home flavour, super comforting during a period of much flu going around :)\n<br />#rickshawnoodles #noodles #sgfood #sghawker #foodporn #burpple
Such a wonderful photo of our talented singer songwriter standing next to a Bak Kut Teh veteran of three decades! @linsitong had an enjoyable breakfast of classic teochew BKT with long gu and natural pork slices. She particularly enjoyed the naturally sweet tasting and peppery broth accompanied by some excellent tea by @psc1925 pek sin choon brand :)\n<br />#linsitong #hahamusic #bakkutteh #rongchengbakkutteh #unclelim #sgfood #sghawker #foodporn #burpple
