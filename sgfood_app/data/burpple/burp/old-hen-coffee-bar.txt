Matcha Cold Milk was a little too milky, and the Valrhona Dark Cocoa isn\'t coffee. Creamy White was not bad though.
The results are usually varied, but we definitely enjoyed the food at @oldhencoffee. \n<br />As the sort of person who eats clotted cream by the spoonful, I\'m now a convert to serving crispy golden waffles with Greek yogurt - jelak-ness, be gone! The Homemade Waffles ($12) here also come heaped with cinnamon-laced apple compote, as well as accents of crumble clusters and ground pistachios. \n<br />#Burpple
It\'s one of my favorite spot.
As much as Old Hen Coffee Bar is not the first to sell bottled coffee, they have done a great job in making me want to come back for more of these chilled beverages.
We need some matcha fuel. Would be great if this was less milky and more matcha-y instead. I can\'t wait for the orange chocolate from @oldhencoffee TO BE OUT!
I didn\'t really like Matcha Milk as i felt it was too milky, can\'t help but wish they had a stronger matcha taste. But am glad to see that latter is back! Cold thick cocoa with a hint of peppermint is just so shiok.
All thanks to Zhi Hui (my one and only delivery girl),  I got my hands on Old Hen Coffee\'s latest creation -  Cold Matcha Milk.
If Old Hen\'s (freakin\' smooth and tasty) cold brew isn\'t your.. cup of tea, you\'d be glad to know that they\'ve got  a good option of creamy Cold Matcha Milk ($7) using quality tea from @ippodotea! Well-balanced without being overpowering and it wasn\'t too sweet. We proceeded to make matcha float with good \'ol Haagen Daz\'s Green Tea ice cream 😂. Gonna stock up the next time I\'m in the area! (Also, my fav valrhona dark cocoa peppermint is baaaack) 
Now your tea drinking friends have no excuse to say no to you (while you have your coffee) 😂
I gave this Chicken Cheese Burrito a try. The chicken was tender although, a bit dry to my liking. I assume, they wanted it to be a healthy choice thus, they didn\'t make it too flavourful which I completely understand considering that this will be, most likely, partnered with coffee. Anyway, it was filling and satisfying. All that matters for a hungry stomach! Hehe 😜 Surely, I\'ll be coming back for their bottled goodness!\n<br />#burpple #oldhencoffeebar #burrito
Cold brew by old hen is famous where people do drop by and grab some to-go cold brews. It comes with several flavours which I think both in the photo are good! The panna cotta is great too. Just to be reminded, there\'s no main course in the coffee bar, only good for tea break (not so great for hangout with friends though, as many Super-hard-working students occupying the seats)!
They definitely have changed the bottles but not sure if they seemed to have changed the recipe as well? This bottle felt less sweet than what I remembered it to be with a lighter coffee taste as well — still a good beverage but it seems to lacks a bit of the punch of the usual standard somehow ...
When you can\'t decide what you want, you get all 3!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #oldhencoffee
Re-visiting all my favorite cafes these days, and it\'s like nothing has changed! @oldhencoffee never fails!
Or drunk on queuing? We went to look see Western Co. but the queue was tai over le (poor bosses lei I mean...). So Hungry Heroes and Old Hen, to check things off 😁 The place is not big, but much cozier than expected because everyone seems to be enjoying their light conversations, even the bosses 😁 The special decos (fan blades and covers on lightbulbs, i wanna try diy too!) really added a lovely touch to the place. There\'s heart 😉😉😉 And needless to say, the coffee was special too, when they take the extra effort to rec you the better batch of coffee 😊 Nano Challa is the name.
Managed to visit Old Hen today, and had the Chicken Cheese Burrito ($11) for lunch. A burrito cut into half with thinly shredded well-cooked chicken and pieces of tomatoes and capsicum inside, who wouldn\'t love that? Not sure if I tasted any cheese though, but what took me away was the perfect crispiness and texture of the burrito and the tender chicken of course!\n<br />•\n<br />Read my full review of this place including their famous White Cold Brew! www.foodwithnic.wordpress.com
🍽: Cold brew, smoke salmon and Apple toast, egg and sausage on toast\n<br />•  \n<br />Price: $6/ $6.50 + $11 + $16\n<br />•\n<br />🚇: Farrer Park \n<br />📍: 88 Rangoon Road #01-03\n<br />•\n<br />Life is filled with decision. White or dark. Which side would you choose? The white is creamy with a tad coffee acidity and a hint of sweetness. Overall its is a well rounded flavor, some may even think its ice mocha. The dark has a stronger robust flavor, which totally suit my liking.\n<br />•\n<br />They do have a small functional kitchen, however i rather not have any high hopes for the food menu. \n<br />•\n<br />So in the end, what did i choose ? I choose both la! I would say is one of the best decision i had ever made. Furthermore, Old hen carries both nylon and oriole coffee which both are my number choice when it comes to coffee.
A short walk from Farrer Park (Exit B), Old Hen minimalistic decor is a welcoming sight. Cold Brew, White ($6.50) is extremely creamy w a hint of coffee acidity. Overall a well rounded flavor. Go for the black if you want a stronger brew! On a side note, they use Nylon and Oriole coffee beans, which are both well known for their coffee ☕️
Using the Raven beans from Oriole, this proves to be a hit especially in our increasingly unbearable weather.
The coffee is exceptionally nice and its cost $6.50 but the downside is that the venue is very small. When it gets crowded, the ambience will similar like a coffee shop, best time to avoid crowd on Sunday will be between 1-3pm.They do have free wifi as well,
Wasn\'t really my intention to drop by for cakes but the spot I am supposed to visit hadn\'t opened way past the opening hour; just thought it would be good to pop by to grab a little something along with a cold brew. Old Hen\'s cakes are supplied, but the loaf cakes are simple stuff that although aren\'t the best, are pretty comforting. A little too crumbly, but I liked how they warm the cakes up before serving and it perfumes of coconut fragrance within while glazed with a sugar icing spiked with lime for a zesty tinge of flavour. 
Homemade Waffles [S$10] with Greek yoghurt, apple compote, pistachios and salted caramel sauce. If only they had ice cream to go along with the waffles. Still, they are one of my favorites.\n<br />Rating: 🌝🌝🌝🌜
This is going to be one of my fav place to go for coffee.
Just a short three minute walk from Farrer Park MRT, Old Hen Coffee Bar is a cosy coffeehouse that is the great for catching up with a friend over light bites and excellent coffee! Be sure to order the popular Creamy White Cold Brew ($6.50) — slightly sweet, lusciously creamy and with a welcome tinge of acidity. In the past, limited edition flavours have been released during holiday seasons, like the Dark Cocoa with Orange for Chinese New Year and Valrhona Dark Cocoa Peppermint for Christmas. Be sure to keep your eye out for these delicious brews!
i like that it didnt came heavy and cheesy all but light hearted and flavors came harmiously together with the homemade honey mustard. berries and greens by the side made meal refreshing. i like it, really!
your move, weather.
A perfect treat when you are feeling a little peckish. I finally tried Old Hen Coffee Bar’s Panna Cotta ($6) earlier this week and really enjoyed the contrasting textures. Made of 3 distinct layers, the chilled glass of smooth vanilla milk pudding, chocolate sauce and crunchy salted caramel popcorn was a delightful concoction. I also recommend to pair the cold brews or in my case their Valrhona Dark Cocoa along with every spoonful of creamy soft pudding and salty-sweet caramelized popcorns, to introduce a different element into the mix and who can leave without at least buying a bottle.
Breakfast essentials to start the day right.\n<br />#OldHenCoffee *

Cheers to the New Year &amp; a Long weekend 🤘🏻(Time to get those last minute spring cleaning done too, then reward yourself with some of these Orange Chocolate drink!!)
I love Chinese New Year, with the goodies, angbaos and most importantly CNY special products. Thus I travelled down to the pop-up at ION Basement 4, to get my hands on Old Hen’s new Valrhona Dark Cocoa with Orange (there till 6 February). At $7 per bottle, the rich and smooth cocoa has the added tinge of lightly sweetened orange. A must-try for those who enjoy the sweet combination of dark chocolate and citrusy orange!\n<br />|\n<br />-Behind-the-scenes-\n<br />Dad: Why are you taking photos of the bottle with oranges?\n<br />Me: It has orange in it!!!! 😍\n<br />Dad: How much is it? 😑\n<br />Me: Er ... not ex la… you want try?
Remember to get the New Year special drink which is available until the end of CNY Season!\n<br />You can get them conveniently from Ion Orchard Event Hall at B4 from 11am to 10pm daily till 6 Feb!
Thanks for taking care of me despite being the eldest muahhahah 😆 \n<br />➊ [Matcha Raspberry Cake S$7.50] - which I find that the combi doesn\'t go well. \n<br />➋ [Valrhona Dark Cocoa Orange S$7] - specially for CNY 🍫🍊 ➌ [Panna Cotta S$6] - our usual favourite. 🍿🍮
Valrhona Dark Cocoa, this time with orange just in time for the festivities. Luscious chocolate drink with subtle citrusy taste. This could never go wrong. 😌 #burpple
Remember the Peppermint version some time back? The folks behind Old Hen Coffee Bar had came up with yet another special for Chinese New Year, where they had infused oranges into their signature Valrhona Dark Cocoa. The same old thick chocolate with malty sweetness with a citrusy touch that\'s pretty akin to mandarin oranges. Lovers of the chocolate and orange flavour combination will definitely enjoy this!
Velvety smooth cocoa now has a tinge of fragrant orange, kinda taste like the orange chocolates we find during CNY house visiting, ONLY BETTER.\n<br />Note: they are having a pop up at Ion Orchard B4 till 5 Feb 2016, for more details check out @oldhencoffee
It is still so velvety smooth and not overly sweet, but with a hint of orange taste in it this time. Just in time for the CNY period. You can also get those bottles of chocolatey goodness at ION Orchard\'s Lunar New Year Festive Market at the Basement 4 Event Hall. They will be there from now til 5th Feb.
Also finally tried thair Panna Cotta $6. Vanilla milk pudding, chocolate sauce and salted caramel popcorn. Simplicity at its best. 🍮
Have you tried it yet??? @oldhencoffee\'s Valrhona Dark Cocoa ORANGE 🍊 [$7]
Sweet panna cotta with their signature cold brew. I prefer their white cold brew out of the 3 choices :)
The Waffles which my fren order is Waffles topped with Cinnamon apples &amp; raisins with vanilla whipped cream. The Waffles is Crispy just nice that the Cinnamon apple taste not too sweet perfect with cream itself. Cost u $.950 come try it is worth it. Address &amp; operating hours see my previous post

| Finally got the chance to try out Old Hen\'s Cold Brew Creamy White after hearing so much about it! &amp; I must say, it\'s creamy alright! It felt as though I was drinking chocolate milk out from that bottle! 😋 For those who are afraid of the bitter taste that coffee has, this could be the game changer for you!
Packed, Old Hen Coffee Bar might lose abit of the café’s potential “laid-back” vibe (as it being my first visit) but good company more than makes up for it. Maybe a visit on a weekday will be better... Heading straight for a bottle of Valrhona Dark Cocoa, a sip of the chocolatey goodness has won me over. The bottle of iced chocolate was simply good, rich and smooth. Coffee lovers should also get their hands on Old Hen’s cold brew which is what most people go there for (got two for my parents and they approve). The food was decent but their beverages definitely fair better. Not forgetting the friendly and attentive service.
After hearing of the pairing between the Panna Cotta and Flat White here from fellow tastemaker Xing Wei, I knew I had to order them the next time I came. And wow, for a non popcorn lover, I actually enjoyed the light crisp yet indulgently caramelized popcorn in the cup. The panna cotta layer was smooth and creamy, without having gelatin bits within, showing how thorough the pudding was mixed before chilling. And yes, pairing this with Flat White was also an instant win for me. Just imagine a mouthful of pudding, followed by a mouthful of fragrant aromatic coffee with beans from Nylon coffee roasters.... I wouldn\'t have it any other way! Old Hen is located along Rangoon Road. Nearest train station being Farrer Park MRT. 
The great thing is if one is not enough for you, you can buy as many bottles 🍾 as you want and take them home with you! By the way, they are having a Peppermint version, which is great for the holiday season. 😊 \n<br />The Ondeh Ondeh cake we had was also pretty damn good!
I swear I can just drive over to take away one. that ondeh ondeh cake was lovely too, moist and very alike the real kueh.
Beside the usual cold brews, they also recently introduced another new flavor, Valrhona Dark Cocoa Peppermint that is so velvety smooth and not overly sweet with a hint of peppermint taste in it. Just in time for the Christmas season!
Velvety chocolatey goodness fit for the season - their Valrhona Dark Cocoa, now with peppermint! ($7)
Essentially dark, husky chocolatey goodness, with the added sensation of a polar bear\'s arctic kiss on your lungs. 3.9/5
If you\'ve tried the original one, this version is lighter and the peppermint gives you a refreshing feeling that lingers around your throat.
@oldhencoffee joins in the festivity with their PEPPERMINT COCOA this year!
OK, if you know then good lor, I lag. But it\'s VERY NICE, the font used for the peppermint also very nice!
Thick and chocolatey, you can depend on Old Hen for a good ol\' ice chocolate! Only problem we faced was the overflowing cafe and had to wait quite a long while for seats. Service was attentive and friendly though! 
Fancy a glass of chilled Panna Cotta topped with chocolate sauce and gourmet popcorn? I did! Feeling a little heavy, I wanted to have a \"light meal\" for lunch, and a \"light dessert\" gave the perfect excuse for such an occasion. This is my all-time favourite dessert and this sure didn\'t disappoint... I happily finished it in no time. As usual, the cafe managed to make me smile again: )
Come try their Cold Brew Bottled Coffee or Dark Cocoa. Look like many ppl order both Chilled Brew Coffee &amp; Dark Cocoa.  The Owner Brew their Coffee &amp; Dark Cocoa Daily.

Their coffee is rich and unique. The cake is huge and has an interesting flavor:)
Conveniently located just across Exit B Farrer Park, this quaint little coffee bar is excellent for a short coffee catch up with an old friend or even a nice relaxed afternoon with your date! 😊 tried their white cold brew coffee 👍🏼 sweet and milky! Yummy! Their matcha raspberry cake was quite dry for my liking though :-( but definitely going back again to intro good coffee to good company, and maybe try their food too! 😊
We didn\'t have a good morning but when we walked into the bar, I suddenly felt like smiling. Greeted by a cosy interior, vibrant atmosphere, and the warm welcome by the service staff, I smiled to myself when I went through the menu. 
Desserts after dinner and the coffee was kinda good, totally worth the $6.50 paid 😍 cakes were a little dry though. 
Can\'t get enough of that creamy milky taste, yet retaining that caffine kick 😍
A good weekend starts with a good brunch. And indeed, brunch doesn\'t get much better with this set of Homemade Waffles ($12 nett) at Old Hen Coffee Bar. 
One of the best I\'ve had! 👍🏻 The Iced Mocha made an impact too!!! ☕️
4 munchies: Thick, succulent chunks of crab meat with homemade coleslaw, hard-boiled egg, corn flakes, and house sweet chilli sandwiched in toasted buns. Loved the hint of sweetness and spiciness to the fresh coleslaw as well as great textures from the ingredients. I could also snack on the crispy thin sweet potato chips served at the side all day. This dish is best served with either the Valrhona Dark Chocolate or White Cold Brew in the background.
monday was just a burger of crab - coleslaw and cornflakes made great texture and the muted tanginess and spiciness ensures your crab meat is enjoyable. then you down everything with that cold brew.
Crisp exterior, crumbling into a fluffy, soft and fragrant batter, simply topped with icing sugar and maple syrup. Served with yogurt, crushed pistachios, cranberries and cooked apples, this is my kinda perfect waffles. If only I could start every day like this.
(August 2015) I honestly am not sure if Old Hen still sells this, but I remember this had me swooning, especially that sweep of greek yoghurt. I\'m also shocked to learn that this photo was completely rid of any filter or edit when I found it in my gallery.
Crab coleslaw burger , all day breakfast and Ondeh Ondeh cake plus must have cold brew coffee 
@lilychonglily brought me to this cafe the other night and intro them to me. Boy, it was good!! So good that I packed 4 bottles home 😋 You can either get the creamy White Cold Brew at $6.00 or for cocoa lovers you might chose to go for the rich Valrhona Dark Chocolate available at $6.50. Have a great Sunday!
✔️ I\'ve seen Old Hen Coffee Bar\'s brown bottles invade my burpple feed a couple of times, the hipster in me decided to give the place a visit. Here what\'s I came for !! Dark chocolate &amp; Cold Brew Creamy White! I love it ~ it\'s just like drinking beer.. 😘😘
.\n<br />|\n<br />Their Panna Cotta had won many \"likes\" by Old Hen Cafe regulars but it was not my liking. There was a weird aftertaste (suspected from its gelatin they used). .\n<br />|\n<br />The idea of combining the different texture was good. However, they might want to change on the serving spoons. IT WAS JUST TOO SHORT!!!
Pairing Greek yogurt with cranberries and cooked apples ain\'t no stroke of genius. Neither is topping that up with some crunch factor (recall breakfast muesli and granolas). But somehow, Old Hen manages to bring this fail-safe combination to a whole new level of delish. The crispy waffles were light and fluffy, boasting a subtle sweet egginess that I so enjoy in a waffle batter. The tart cooked apples were a delicate balance of sweet and sour, retaining it\'s delectable crunch. The cranberries, while sparse, added that touch of sweet when you least expect it. Eaten together, this makes possibly one of the best waffles I\'ve had.
Yes it\'s a PH in Singers but who wastes the precious time in bed?! New post(s) on the blog. Time to get some coffee into the tummy and here is my favorite cold brew from Old Hen Coffee Bar. Some beauty loving from @thedrxmedispa is up as well so if you\'re in need of some pampering this long hol. Active link in bio. Head on over!
The chocolate is pretty thick to finish alone- best to take it with the coffee which makes them a good blend. (I didn\'t try the kopi-o tho 😂 koped from another drinker for the pic) 
an impromptu jio led to a nice lil catchup while marking this off my bookmark list! 😊 love their cold brew (black) which is strong yet incredibly smooth, without the usual astringent aftertaste of most black coffee! their airy light waffles are surprisingly good too! served w greek yogurt and pistachios &amp; cranberries, apple compote, cookie crumble and caramel sauce!!!! 😘😘😘 #newregularjoint #burpple
I like it when a cafe bottles their drinks. Because I can buy a few bottles and create a secret stash at home. And also they have ensured that the quality of the drinks are able to maintain till the day you drink it. Smooth, milky, sweet coffee that is indeed creamy and white. Makes for a nice drink on a stay home and nua day.
So good I had to have it again.  Also, finally managed to try the black cold brew.  I think I still prefer the white one.
Back here again after a while and the presentation changed! Waffles are still as good as before, crisp and fluffy, perfect flavour combo with the smoky caramel sauce. I can really do without the Greek yogurt and apple. Just gimme the waffle + caramel sauce + cookie crumble (so delicious). 
What made this stand out was the fact that it wasn\'t your usual sea-salt something ice cream and waffle combo. Instead, the waffle was paired with Greek yogurt, cinnamon apples, some sort of sugary crumble, and salted caramel sauce. Sweet and tart at the same time, it was a nice change from your usual waffle dessert suspects. It didn\'t feel as heavy nor sugar-loaded, and is easier to stomach after a meal. The waffle was quite well done as well (crispy and fluffy), which is always a plus. 
A bottle of Old Hen coffee is perfect in tackling the terrible Singapore heat. The  Dark Cocoa (Velvet Brown) is rich and chocolatey, but not too \"jelat\". The chocolate compliments the coffee instead of overpowering it. I personally preferred the creamy white. For those who prefer lattes, this milky concoction would be perfect for you. It isn\'t too sweet also, so the coffee still takes centre stage. At $6.50 a pop, I would say it\'s pretty ok considering that most iced coffees are around that price range as well. 
White brew, or caffe latte. The espresso shots are pulled from the seasonal Four Chairs blend gotten from Nylon. I enjoyed this till the last drop and I think the $4.50 I paid was worthwhile. 
Crab Coleslaw Burger 🍔 ($13) - I was a little afraid I wouldn\'t like this because I dislike overly sour coleslaw, but NO RAGRATS GUYS. This is delicious! Sufficiently tangy with a hint of spice, &amp; the hard boiled eggs &amp; cornflakes (haha) add nice flavour &amp; texture (respectively) to it. The sweet potato chips on the side are exactly like my favourite ones from Cambodia, too.
Back here again recently and as usual, it never disappoints. A combination of Greek yogurt, stewed Apple, dried cranberry, pistachio and drizzle over with salted caramel for sweetness, while the pistachio gave an extra crunch. One of the affordable and better ones out there 👍🏼
Old Hen Coffee was running full house. So I grabbed a bottle of the much-loved Dark Cocoa to go. 
Nothing to pick on. Nice waffle and drinks.\n<br />Damage:  waffle $10/- drinks $6.50 per pint
Wanted to give in to my degenerate drunkardness but since Burpple is all about coffee, I suppose it makes sense to toast with this dependable classic instead. Here\'s to the next thousand!
The Cold Brew, Dark Cocoa and a slice of the Ondeh-Ondeh cake. Simple awesome. Chill out ambience, friendly counter staffs.
I can\'t believe it\'s not mid week yet. \n<br />I need a drink...\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
and yet the thought of ice cubes diluting your coffee makes you frown, then this is absolutely the perfect answer!
The last I had it was when I was down with a fever and vividly remembered that it was good. I\'m having this like a chill pill and it never fails :) Enjoy the long weekend folks!
I\'ll look at you. \n<br />Who takes the first sip?\n<br />Nobody knows. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster \n<br />#oldhencoffee

I\'d like to dial up the cocoa a little, but this is pretty decent. \n<br />And I finally SPOTTED the black coffee – was beginning to wonder if that\'s as real as Big Foot – but alas, that last bottle was already spoken for. But hey, at least now I know it EXISTS. #burpple
Never did I felt so delighted with this good serve of Panna Cotta over @ Old Hen Coffee Bar. I just love how the chocolate sauce matches so well with the caramel popcorns. This is how your weekend should be spent!
Very rich in flavours, even though it\'s not so creamy and chocolatey. Parfait!
Have yet to try out the Dark Coca, heard so much about it.
There wasn\'t much options on their humble menu but I would say that my experience here was delightful. The much raved-about Dark Cocoa drink priced at $6.5 was so lovely that you\'ll be most careful not to waste a single drip of it! I came with expectations and my expectations were met. Definitely making more trips back here for the drink. It did help that I visited the cafe on a quiet Thursday afternoon!
Cold brew from Old Hen Coffee.  They ran out of the black :/
Old hen\'s cold brew is just so darn good. Also finally tried their Panna cotta. It\'s amazingly good. 😋👍
The texture was so smooth, and it wasn\'t too sweet. 👍🏻
Starting the weekends well with these
Stocked up these awesome cold brew to keep me awake, hustle time!
Quaint little cafe tucked in the corner of Farrer Park. Their brunch looks amazing, i wanna try! 😿
Despite my love for latte art, i secretly prefer cold coffee to hot coffee. Who\'s with me? 🙋
Under the sweltering heat, what better way to cool down than with a bottle of Dark Cocoa ($6.50) from Old Hen Coffee Bar. Velvety smooth and with a strong cocoa flavour, this is definitely not your average run-of-the-mill chocolate drink.
Unpretentious toasty comfort food, simple salad on the side served with strawberries.
Finally got to try their bottled coffee. They have 3 flavors, black coffee, coffee with milk and chocolate. It\'s nice and easy to drink if u r a non coffee drinker. Their waffles are surprisingly nice! Crispy and light! Niceeee.. 
The Creamy White Cold Brew stored in a charmed glass bottle was silky, cool and soothing. Not too sugared and perfectly chilled, I couldn’t find a better option to combat the scorching weather. On the other hand, the Strawberry Balsamic Cake tasted surprisingly delicious. It was dense, moist and not overly creamy. The icing had a jello texture, making every bite fulfilling. For full review, visit www.imhaydenchan.blogspot.com
Finally made a trip down to Old Hen to try this highly raved Dark Chocolate drink! There is a slight bitterness that lingers in your mouth after a few sips, just like dark chocolate bars. 
Beside the usual cold brew coffee, they also recently introduced a new flavor, Valrhona Dark Cocoa that is so velvety smooth and not overly sweet with a slightly bitter taste in it. This is so PERFECT for non coffee drinkers and chocolate lovers! Definitely the best ice cold chocolate drink I had so far!
Cold brew? Yes please. I really ought to buy some home, but then I wouldn\'t be able to sleep. I wish caffeine didn\'t have that effect on me, then I\'d drink more coffee all day err\' day
I easily feel happy by tiny things and this is one of them... WAFFLES!
Like a darkly chocolatey and bittersweet serenade for your lips. 4.2/5 #Burpple
Simple night alone coffee treat. Good ambience to stone and do people watching. The cold brew is still good. The cake, Blossom, is pretty. It is Raspberry and Rose flavor with cheese filling. Not too sweet, which is good but the texture is a little rough and dry for my liking. I\'ve spent $14 for this night treat! Despite all these, I still enjoyed my night out! 
Old Hen\'s waffles are of the more yeasty type, so expect a bit of crisp on the outside. Love how the waffles came filled with honeyed crumbles and pistachio but the caramalised apples don\'t seem to really go well with the Greek yoghurt as it seemed to give off a very intense sourish flavour.
Chilled Dark Cocoa in a bottle, this one is very similar to their Cold Brew. Valrhona Dark Cocoa was adequately thick, at the same time being sweet and malty; comparable to their white cold brew. Pretty worth the try.
And probably one of the best cold brews I have tasted.
At $6.50, the cold brew coffee has a distinctive milkier taste. Though not a coffee enthusiast, I must say it does remind me of kopi-si. 
The Matcha Latte ($5) here is one that has the green tea flavour and the milky goodness balanced together! 
Finally succumbed to a pound cake! Expected a stronger earl grey fragrance and maybe for the pound cake to be less dry. Nevertheless, it was still quite a lovely complement to the coffee. 
Decided to try their white coffee even though they\'re most famous for their cold brew. Coffee is smooth, not too acidic either. It would have gone perfectly with a pound cake (:
A week of challenges awaits me - two 6 hours 830am lectures with the UK Caucasian, scary wisdom tooth removal and lots of self motivated studying and exercises to accomplish! Here\'s to a good week ahead and hope I survive that wisdom tooth surgery! A panna cotta topped with chocolate sauce and caramel popcorns from #oldhencafebar for the sweet tooths like me 😄 Thank you @makanarts for organising today\'s #instameet and @eleoration and @geekyelephant for the enjoyable day today 😁
Always comforting to have good coffee in ur hands
Finishing off Sunday on a good note.
Cheers!
I\'ve always relied on Old Hen to satisfy those cravings for cold brew
Sunday brunch. Croque monsieur with white cold brew. One of the better cold brew I\'ve tasted so far. Worth the time to explore. 
Come here for a relaxing afternoon, with excellent cold brews and unpretentious light bites
If you\'re itching for a refreshing caffeine fix on a hot day, stopping by Old Hen Coffee for a bottle of their famous cold brew would be a wise choice. Just a 3-minute walk from Farrer Park MRT station, this cafe dishes out light cafe bites, desserts and coffee. For something savoury, the Croque Monsieur comes highly recommended, as is the case for their Breakfast Toast -- a delicious combination of egg mayo, turkey bacon and cornflakes. Popping in for just a cuppa and some sweets? Choose from a selection of cakes and tarts on display. You\'d be silly to leave without first getting hold of a bottle (or two!) of their Creamy White Cold Brew. Slightly sweet, creamy, and with little acidity, this is a truly refreshing beverage!
What do you get when you put greek yogurt, apple crumble, pistachio and salted caramel together? Nom nom nom.
Although they add sugar into their cold brew, I thought this was pretty great! Nutty, chocolatey coffee was the perfect drink for the afternoon.
It tastes like a cross between chocolate milk and coffee; probably because of the blend and maybe it\'s because of the small amount of sugar in the drink. I like it though! It\'s a refreshing change to the normal white cold brews I\'ve had that are sugarless. 
Tried the white before so today decided to try their black. *be warned * sugar level is only 10% so stay away if you are sweet tooth.
If you\'re in for something cold, Cold Brew is definitely a perfect choice for such 🔅 weather. At the same time, you get your caffeine fixed! 
Latte - $2\n<br />Mocha - $5.50\n<br />Thai milk tea sliced pound cake - $3\n<br />Lovely date - priceless!!
Red velvet cake tonight, was deciding between waffles, this and thai milk tea loaf... wanted to get alllllllll
Trying yet another new dish here at Old Hen; decided to go for the Crab Coleslaw Toast this time. Crab meat with coleslaw makes a refreshing twist, especially with the accompanied homemade sweet chili sauce that tingles the tastebuds with its sweet spiciness. Comes with garden salad that\'s the same as the one that came with my Croque Monsieur which I had some time back.
The cold brew from Old Hen Coffee Bar is unique in its own. Try drinking coffee in this beer bottle, I\'m in love 😍
One look at one might easily pass this off as a Carrot Cake, but it\'s actually a Banana Cake that comes with cream cheese, chunks of banana and maple cream. It\'s sinfully sweet, but definitely an option for those who loves banana cakes and carrot cakes.
Went for a light lunch, and I was recommended the Croque Monsieur by the owners. Love that crisp toasted bread with grains on edges that gave it a crunch. Covered generously with stringy melted cheese, each bite is indulgence with the classic and faultless combination of ham and cheese. Garden salad was fresh and came with a few chunks of strawberries which introduced a subtle berry tartness to the greens, which was smothered in a sweet honey dressing that hinted of plum.
Famous for their cold brew, this is one of the must-order here. The smooth and milky taste of this Creamy White Cold brew is just too ideal for a hot place like Singapore.
The waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside which is quite well made. However with Greek yogurt and apple compote, the waffling smell is masked, only left with the sour smell of the yogurt. The combination is on the sour side and I would hope that there will be a better balance between the sweet and sour taste.
Nice coffee fix. Black 3oz while white is 5oz and I love my cup served in Tiffany blue.
I like it when cafés come up with interesting twists on usual food items. An example would be this Panna Cotta; not only does it come with a silky smooth milk pudding at the bottom, there are also chocolate sauce and caramel coated popcorn that adds a sweet touch to the salted caramel. No doubt this is just pure sweetness, but it keeps the sweet-tooth in me happy. And what\'s a visit to Old Hen without their signature Creamy White Cold Brew?
Moist banana cake with a peanut butter spread, together with buts and chocolate chips for the little crunch! I\'m currently crazy over banana cakes and bread, so, do give me some recommendations for a good banana fix alright!

Waffle was really crisp on the outside! Some parts had the smoky burnt taste which wasn\'t that good. But I like the waffle here very much, with the taste of freshly baked bread/pastry. Thai milk tea was pretty average, but a nice drink to complement the waffle!
Shall try the cold brew next time. 
One of the better cold brews I\'ve had! At $6 per bottle, it\'s definitely worth more than the run of the mill, overpriced starbucks coffee! Oh and there\'s a thai milk tea pound cake($3.50) too! DELISH 
#cravingsatisfied
Waffles was crunchy on the outer, but the inner was fluffy. Served with yogurt, jam &amp; strawberries. 
It\'s hot! Pound cake! The white icing is the citrus! Tiny bits of earl grey flavoring... 
One of the newest brunch item to be introduced in Old Hen is this Crab Coleslaw Toast ($8.50) that consist of crab meat mixed with coleslaw sandwiched onto 2 slices of toasted bread and served with salad.
Yes to Cold Brew at Old Hen Coffee bar! Headed over alone for breakfast, and it\'s so nice to see sincere people at work :) thank you Old Hen, I hope you see this! (I had a cup of 5 Oz white before this too&gt;
$6 breakfast with 5 Oz white and a Cold brew after, was a good morning breakfast with happy and sincere people at work. Thanks Old Hen, you didn\'t disappoint! 
Trying their Espresso-based drinks finally; their coffee is made form Oriole\'s Raven blend, which is chocolatey and nutty. It\'s a wee bit milky also.
The first place that comes to mind whenever I\'m craving for a cold brew. Tried an ice filter coffee today (mildly sweet and refreshing, super love it) because they still do not have a black cold brew (yet). Went for a granola instead of the usual waffle because I just had macdonald\'s for breakfast (already regretting my choice 😩😩) did I mention that their service is just amazing? Friendly and attentive. And they don\'t even have svc charge 😂😂
Old Hen just recently introduced their light bites menu, which includes a wrap, a sandwich and Croque Monsieur. Ciabatta was crisp and light, while the savoury and fresh smoked salmon slices matched well with the crunchy and sweet red and green apple chunks. The garden salad at the side had a dressing that was a mix of sesame, orange and maple syrup; sweet yet slightly tangy. Simple yet delightful quick lunch bite.
Must try. Also love the concept of fan cover for lighting.
Unpretentious brothers Ivan Mason and Terry. Simple and sincere. Good for r and r.
For a non coffee lover like myself, this cold brew white coffee is smooth and delicious! 👍 #date #cafe #coffee
Ever walked by a coffee bar while just on the way to another location? Old Hen is just situated a short walk away from Farrer Park MRT Station in the way of Pek Kio Food Centre, and specialises in filter coffee and cold brews. Using Oriole blends, their cold brews are strong, robust and even sweet; a treat to have while walking in the crazy hot weather these days. Their food menu is currently limited to waffles and muesli for soft launch, but expect it to expand soon. Run by three young adults, their entrepreneurial spirit and effort placed into running this cafe deserves to be supported!
Originally coming with blueberry compote, they replaced it with poached apples for mine as they had ran out of blueberry compote. I loved the soft crispness of their waffles; not overly hard and soft but bread-like inside. The apples were sweet; matched the chocolate syrup and the honey-infused yoghurt perfectly for a slight tartness.
An unfortunate change of plans due to last minute arrangements found myself fortunately ending up here to try what everyone\'s been talking about. Old Hen is pretty known for their Cold Brews which comes in these pretty bottles! They were only left with the White brews, which I must say is really creamy and milky. It also has a sort of malty-sweetness in it; pretty intriguing I must say!
...probably the best i\'ve had. {i feel like getting a carton and putting it in the office} • also, loving the interior &amp; friendly staffs. ☺️
 Love taking shots of half-eaten food.I\'m weird like that. hahaha.
Love the color contrast of the tart. The pâte sucrée didn\'t work for me as I felt it lacked flavor. The green tea mousse was smooth but the matcha taste was kinda subtle. Would prefer a stronger matcha flavor.
Old Hen Cold Brew - So well-received that they are sold out on first day of opening. If you are heading there today, please note that they will not be serving cold brew &amp; waffles today.
a twin and their younger brother. yes old hen coffee, opening it\'s doors to the public yesterday. located around farrer park mrt, this tiny upstart serves up coffee which imo is rather good. food offerings though are rather limited. a place to check out if ur around de area. good luck boys!
Old Hen Cold Brew using Oriole\'s Raven blend. Smooth, creamy, well balanced coffee. Slightly sweeter than normal coffee due to lower acidity. It\'s good!
A newly opened cafe by a friend of mine in the army, along with his friends who look like twins to me. You can order the coffee either in 3 or 5 oz, and 5oz being the default option. It\'s conveniently located next to Farrer Park mrt and the owners are young and friendly. They have a speciality which is their cold brew which is prepared 18 hours before hand without hot water and only mixed with milk only on the day itself. I will surely be back one day to try out their full menu when I have the chance! 
Interesting white cold brew and yummy buttermilk waffles. Cafe just opened today by 3 brothers! #老母鸡? Cafe by tip basis for today ^^
decided to try this new one day old cafe. coffee was smooth and good. tried your cold brew yet?
Brewed with Raven blend from Oriole this goes down smooth. Milky goodness on hot days! (๑´ڡ`๑) 
For those who prefer stronger brew, you can order the 3 Oz. Matcha mousse tart is from Kreme Couture, tasted quite plain to us. Buttermilk waffles must be eaten together with the toppings so that the taste of the baking soda is not prominent.
Opening day! #coffeeandcravings

I am happy to say that this is one of the cafes that has always maintained its quality and consistency since they first started. While many cafes have come and gone, Old Hen has withstand the weather and stood firm in the cafe scene.\n<br />•\n<br />Renowned for their Cold Brew Coffee, I decided to switch things up a little and got for myself the Cold Matcha Milk ($7) instead. With the strong hint of matcha and the creaminess from the milk, this is a perfect beverage to just sit back, relax and escape from the sweltering heat outside.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Old Hen Coffee Bar\n<br />Address: 88, Rangoon Road, Singapore 218374\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #oldhencoffee #oldhencoffeebar

i say this is totally worth the hype! though i\'d much prefer the white to the black one. creamy white that\'s real smooth and ain\'t too sweet. the smooth black has a sour aftertaste though, suitable to the palate of the old man.😂\n<br />.\n<br />#coffee #coldbrew #coldbrewcoffee #oldhencoffee #oldhencoffeebar #vscofood #vsco #vscosg #sgeat #buzzfeedfood #buzzfood #instaeat #instaeatsg #instaeats #igsgeats #igsgfood #sgfood #sgeat #sgfoodie #sgcafehopping #sgcafes #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafehop #cafehop #cafehopping #burpple #burpplesg #onthetable #yweat

Breakfast on point.
Breakfast fix on 2017.
Cheers to my first coffee on 2017.
I like them for being milky but not overly sweet. The milk coffee did remind me of the taste of iced milk tea from some roti prata restaurant though. I think they just made a recently imported Taiwan bottled coffee and tea pale in comparison.\n<br />#coffeeortea #oldhencoffee #cafehoppingsg #burpple #burpplesg #foreverhungry
👍🏻 Nice.
This is my favourite cold brew in beer bottle ☄️
Anyway, the coffee bar is just an MRT station away from Boon Keng, I just felt I needed a treat on a Monday. Mainly, for good vibes in the next busy days ahead.
.
TGIW! Enjoying triple treats of the signature Charcoal Vanilla Soft Serve @thecoldpantry with the girls. Apart from the unique colour, the soft serve is really smooth and creamy with a perfect sweetness of vanilla. However, it may be a little pricey at $4.50/serving.

Delicious! Really!
Soooooo gooooooood!
I swear I start sweating right after my shower. this intense humid weather should stop.
Not too shabby, but slightly thin. Only found out the cold brews ($6.5) were recommended after I got a capp. Gets crowded even on weekday afternoons which is a shame for the lone wanderer seeking solace in solitude. 
I hope they\'d never discontinue this because I simply loved how everything just went together so well, THAT slight bitter cocoa-y aftertaste. Ah..
😢
Happy Chinese New Year!

cap it off and pour it into a ice mug. no need to add ice. smooth yet balanced.
Such a refreshing touch to the usual dark cocoa.

We miss this cold brew so much!
Their cold brew 😍😍😍 Tried their waffle and wrap and it was pretty good too!
I did! Feeling a little heavy, I wanted to have a \"light meal\" for lunch, and a \"light dessert\" gave the perfect excuse for such an occasion. This is my all-time favourite dessert and this sure didn\'t disappoint... I happily finished it in no time. As usual, the cafe managed to make me smile again: )
JB anyone ?
Greeted by a cosy interior, vibrant atmosphere, and the warm welcome by the service staff, I smiled to myself when I went through the menu. \n<br />I was all smiles and when I placed my order, pointing gleefully at the cakes asking about the flavour, and the friendly guy behind the counter explained to me equally gleefully. I made him repeat a few times and he patiently and good-naturedly did. \n<br />When the cold brew was served, I looked at my companion joyfully wildly as if I strike TOTO. I wasn\'t really sure why I was behaving like this? Being an unadventurous person, he eyed the bottle wearily. I took a sip and handed the bottle excitedly to him. He took a sip and nodded with approval, and studied the words on the bottle. \"They made it here own their own?\" He said. We were really impressed as this was nothing like we ever had.\n<br />When the ondeh ondeh was served, my companion and I took bites at it continuously..it was delicious! He teased me about putting on weight, I stuck out my tongue at him, and he blew kisses at me behind his papers to make up for it. \n<br />Simply love the magic that the cafe had on us.

Felt like the caramel and chocolate masked too much of the vanilla.  Otherwise, a pleasant dessert.

Ok, so this waffles at Old Hen jumped to my top spot, overtaking Wimbly Lu. Aroi Mak Mak!!! I also love their Cold Brew coffee. Hearing from foodies that they love the coffee here, I knew I had to come.

Waffles were really light and crisp, and I love the side toppings of Greek yogurt, stewed apples and pistachio bits! 😋

WAFFLES!
Velvety smooth and with a strong cocoa flavour, this is definitely not your average run-of-the-mill chocolate drink.
Crab coleslaw burger ($13) and chips with chicken cheese burrito. ($10) #cafehopping #cafe #burpple
😋😋😋😋😋
Not too sweet as well. Best enjoyed with some tea but we went with cold brew instead.
Great for a light, healthy bite.
A bit too creamy for me, would prefer a stronger coffee taste
Great coffee, cosy setting, unpretentious barristas 👍

1 more day to Friday, hang on guys!🍻
Good cuppa 
Ham and cheese.
Waffles with yogurt, apple and salted caramel sauce. Really crispy.
Waffles with greek yoghurt and apple compote goes quite well together even tough the yoghurt may be alittle too sourish for me. Wash it down with one of their signature cold brew. And yes, the staffs there are very approachable friendly and i really love the ambience of this cafe situated at farrer park.
Much sweeter than black.
😊
Matcha tart and nutty banana! So Yums!
Early grey citrus, Thai tea $3 each. Red velvet $6.
So tasty
Yum! Sweet and tasty without the icing!
love the atmosphere, we were the only customers when we reach there! would love to try their cinnamon toast &amp; thai milk tea pound cakes! 
was greeted by their friendly workers, calming surroundings (plus point they have Kinfolks &amp; Frankie Mag) ordered cheesy chicken wrap &amp; buttermilk waffles, matcha latte, &amp; hot chocolate, everything cost below $30. worth the try! 
...egg mayo • turkey bacon • cornflakes.
Surprisely good! Nt that sweet...\"wink! 
...coffee fix with the guest visitor.
$7.50 - warm toasty comfort food on yummy bread!
$4.50 and $6.50. Smiles are free!
For coffee lovers, the Cold brew is recommended here.
Checking out this new cafe along Rangoon Road.
