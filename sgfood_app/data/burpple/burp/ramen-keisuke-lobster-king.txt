So much has been said about their lobster ramen that I decided to review their gyoza instead. Just seeing the shrimp tails poking out reminded me so much of the shrimp dumplings I had in Shibuya. I liked this gyoza. The shrimp was sweet and fresh, making these gyoza a cut above the rest. I will order this again.
They made a big production of preparing the tartar sauce right in front of you as you waited for the chicken nanban. I appreciated the freshness of the sauce and the entertainment. It tasted wonderful. But not so the chicken. It was doused in a soy based sauce that was too salty. I would have preferred they omit the sauce and just let me pair it with the tartar sauce instead.
Rich and flavorful lobster broth :pp so full but totally worth it
Lobster king ramen ($14.90). At first spoonful, the lobster-seafood sweetness of the broth hits you full on and leaves one hankering for a second. Midway though, it starts to feel a little heavy. Think I prefer the Tori (chicken) one if we talk about variations, and the best still, the original tonkotsu. The cha shu here is also different - chicken instead of your usual pork.\n<br />As usual, we swooped on the free well-marinated bean sprouts and boiled eggs.
It\'s like drinking lobster bisque and the rich soup is simmered with French lobsters for 10 hours. As usual the noodles, eggs and char Siew are so Keisuke-good. Comes with prawn wanton and chicken char Siew as an interesting twist too.
Finally got down to trying this! Love the rich soup and springy ramen and the toppings it came with - spring onions, bamboo shoots, black fungus, prawn wanton (this was awesome! Couldn\'t tell what spice they used, but it isn\'t your standard wanton). Added chicken, pork and fried prawn ball, all really good, except for the pork which had a porky smell that day. Definitely coming back again if I\'m around the area in the evening.
Super love it! The broth was just nice, not your normal typical ramen. The soup taste just like the Lobster Bisque at Jack\'s Place.
And we are spoilt for choices when it comes to late night eateries in Singapore. This largest ramen chain in Singapore offers freeflow of hardboiled eggs, sprouts and a selection of condiments which i probably wont use at all, opens from 6pm to 5am daily. The thick broth resembling eating ramen off lobster bisque is pretty rich here. And i find myself eating more ingredients than the noodles itself. Shall stick to lesser add-ons the next time round.\n<br />.\n<br />And i like their specialty greentea cola which actually pretty much tastes like normal cola with the royalty of green colour. ‚Äî$4\n<br />.\n<br />Also, you\'ll be surprised how crowded it is in clarke quay. Festive mood and TGIF! Last friday of the year.
Finally tried the spicy lobster ramen chocked full of ingredients: prawn wanton, flavored egg. üòãüòã
had this twice - both late at night and in freezing weather, which is perfect since no queue + nice feeling since the soup warms my insides!! but i never really got the hype... soup is tasty but imo too filling &amp; i\'ve never been able to finish it but nonetheless, foresee myself going back for some comfort supper whoop
Where is the lobster emoji?
Everything was very well done and tender. This was the all in, special version. Felt superbly full after having it. #throwback #burpple #tingzieeats
For my order, I chose light for saltiness of the broth, less oil and hard noodles. I really liked the soup. The sweetness of lobster coupled with the savoury and fragrant blend of 3 different types of miso made for a good, full-bodied broth. I also found this miso to have a more delicate flavour compared to other miso ramen I\'ve had, so it definitely didn\'t overpower. If you would like a more pronounced flavour of lobster, the clear lobster broth was also tasty and very homely. It also didn\'t taste like a glorified version of prawn noodles to me, cause it was sweeter and had a purer flavour. I didn\'t really fancy the toppings here (but I appreciated the variety - dumpling, chicken chashu and pork chashu), which paled in comparison to what\'s offered at other Keisuke branches.
The sixth concept (on my list) from Keisuke brings us ramen swimming in lobster broth. In my attempt to recreate the lobster bisque, I ordered their signature Rich Lobster Broth Ramen Special [S$20.90] (all toppings please üôã) with \"ÊøÉ„ÅÑ\" settings.
The ingredients are the star at Ramen Keisuke Lobster King!
Preferred this over their kani concept ramen. Soup is flavourful, noodles are springy, comes with a shrimp dumpling, egg is soft and nicely done. Just that it is slightly pricey.
Wow. I am back again! Was second in the queue 35min before they opened. Service was good as they served us free genmai tea even thou we will be going in the restaurant soon. 
This clear lobster broth ramen ($13.90) tasted like prawn based wanton mee soup without the yellow ghee so its great! The only wanton in the bowl has too much skin. Xoxo, wet tissue no have BUT cheers to free flow yummy bean sprouts + boiled eggs \n<br />Ps: the white eggs are easier to peel than the brown eggs
The rich creamy ramen ($14.90) taste like Whitley prawn mee plus cream. The first few spoons of the soup tastes great but I quickly got tired of the strong flavour. I think I am very old school. I still prefer the pork based broth at its other branches. Xoxo, wet tissue no have BUT free flow boiled eggs and beansprouts üòÅ
Was contemplating between the (healthier choice) clear soup or the rich, creamy broth, and greediness pointed to the latter which I had no regrets ordering at all! üòÅ super flavourful umami broth, with springy noodles and other toppings like pork char siew, chicken char siew that was marinated with some very fragrant rice wine (I think) and a prawn dumpling. This indulgence was totally worth it üòã #ramen #burpple #foodporn #foodspotting
This robust lobster broth simply took my breath away! Was contemplating between the (healthier choice) clear soup or the rich, creamy broth, and greediness pointed to the latter which I had no regrets ordering at all! üòÅ super flavourful umami broth, with springy noodles and other toppings like pork char siew, chicken char siew that was marinated with some very fragrant rice wine (I think) and a prawn dumpling.

Broth infused with the taste of lobster is not an usual affair with its premium pricing. With the broth spending long hours simmering in the pot, it is of little wonder the restaurant enjoys snaking queues. Spicy variants in my opinion should be avoided as they overwhelmed the lobster taste which is the point of visiting the restaurant. Go for the option with all ingredients! It is definitely worth it. Check out\n<br />http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2017/01/food-review-ramen-keisuke-lobster-king.html
We tried the rich lobster broth which was simmered for hours to obtain the rich orange colour. The full bodied broth have a good taste of lobster and reminds of lobster bisque. Full ingredients option were chosen that came with things like shrimp wanton and chicken chashu not normally found in ramen. \n<br />The spicy miso version was tad overpowering with the chilli taste proving too strong for the lobster flavour. Do go for the clear or rich soup to get the best out of this ramen joint which is what the snaking queues of people are here for. \n<br />Check out below for in depth review\n<br /> http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2017/01/food-review-ramen-keisuke-lobster-king.html
The soup is thick enough to remind me of lobster bisque, which I love. It can be a little too rich for local taste, especially since it\'s only open during dinner and supper. The bamboo in this outlet was not the usual scentless type I\'m used to Keisuke serving (think Taiwanese bamboo). I\'ll definitely opt to leave it out next time.
Had the ramen in rich and clear base. Would prefer the rich base, very tasty! The fried chicken with homemade mayo sauce was remarkable! Chicken was tender and juicy even after deep fried.
Finally tried this lobster ramen. It\'s tasty &amp; seafoody, but definitely not like traditional ramen in the porky sense. I might try the clear broth next time.... Provided I don\'t have to wait in line. Do people still queue 45 mins - 1 hour for this? I know I wouldn\'t.
Ordered extra of them yummy prawn balls but would skip the prawn wontons next time; The skins were too thick.
The flavours in the lobster broth are too rich for me. If I were to go back, I\'ll try the clear broth. Maybe I\'ll enjoy it more.
Really a slurp-worthy ramen dish with free beansprouts and hard boiled eggs ! Very affordable as well !\n<br />Note that they open from 6pm to 5am which can cater to party goers in the area haha ^^!
For those who prefer a less daunting option to the thicker lobster broth, the clear soup has a pleasant and subtle yuzu flavor that complements the lobster broth quite well. Not sure if it\'s just me but the soup reminded me of prawn mee üòÇ Again, not sure if it\'s a matter of personal preference but I didn\'t think it was a particularly special bowl of ramen worth the queue :(
Added on a prawn ball and a wanton; can do without them. Next up, Keisuke Kani King! \n<br />Meanwhile, I think I\'d stick to Keisuke Tori King (chicken) and Keisuke Tonkotsu King (pork) over this...
Rainy day got me thinking about the lobster broth ramen by Keisuke! Word of advice: the spice in the Spicy Miso Lobster ramen overpowers the soup broth, so go for the rich creamy one instead (it can be a tad salty for some tastebuds). Not my fav Keisuke branch but won\'t mind dining here again if there\'s no Q!
Lobster Broth Ramen Special ($19.90++)\n<br />In clear broth with all toppings, which includes lobster balls, wantons, and chicken cha Siew.\n<br />Available at @Ramen_Keisuke in @ClarkeQuaySG \n<br />The chicken cha siew tasted like soaked in sake.\n<br />Help yourself to the free flow marinated bean sprouts and hard boiled eggs. The marinated bean sprouts tasted peppery here.\n<br />I saw bag boxes around but not given to customers to use.\n<br />|\n<br />Ramen Keisuke Lobster King\n<br />Address üè† : Clarke Quay - 3C River Valley Road, # 01-07 The Cannery, Singapore üá∏üá¨ 179 022\n<br />Tel ‚òéÔ∏è : 6255 2928\n<br />Open üíà : 6pm - 5am\n<br />MRT üöá : Clarke Quay (NE5)\n<br />Note üìù : 10th outlet, 62 seater with alfresco dining.
ramen taken to a whole new level with their creamy &amp; thick lobster-bisque like soup, goood to the last slurp!! üòÜüòã am definitely going back for more!
Open daily from 6pm to 5am, this late night ramen joint is the place to go after hours of merry making in the Clarke Quay area. Choose from four different styles of ramen, all of which come with a French lobster base broth that has been simmered for six hours. For a jolt of heat to wake you up from a tipsy stupor, go for the Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($15.90), which comes topped with tender pork belly, chicken char siew, black pepper prawn wantons and bamboo shoots. The tongue-numbing, flavourful broth is a blend of Sichuan sancho peppers, chilli oil and three types of miso. They also serve a very tasty Fluffy Omelette Rice ($10.80).\n<br />Avg price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh
Managed to get in the queue early and was the first few! Had the Rich Lobster Broth Ramen with special toppings, soup tastes very much like a seafood bisque. #burpple
Went all out and had the strong, rich, creamy soup. Super slurp worthy with a strong crustacean flavour. Elsewhere, the chashu was pretty mediocre as was the mirin seasoned chicken breast. But with the superior lobster broth, I won\'t mind queuing to have it again!
I\'m tomato ketchup inside! ü§ó My fav kinda fried rice, reminds me of my childhood days. Not such a big fan of the soy gravy though, a tad oily and way too much of it. Would recommend asking for it to be on the side. Came for lobster ramen (very good too) but got hooked to this omu rice dish! \n<br />#sgfood #omu #ketchup #friedrice #burpple
Free eggs and stir fry bean sprouts. It was ok. Not as lip smacking as I thought. Did not leave me wanting more.
Chicken Namban! This Crispy Fried Chicken with Egg Mayo &amp; Pickle Dressing was super awesome. Crisp skin on the outside with tender meat underneath that! Something that I would highly recommend those who visit. Delicious!!! Must Try!! 5/5
This was the Spicy Version of the Lobster Ramen!! Pretty spicy like it looks but I felt the original tasted better without the Chilli overpowering the lobster broth\'s original goodness. 3/5
Lobster Ramen (Original), whole nine yards with all additional items, Seaweed, Egg, Bamboo Shoots, Cha Siu, Chicken, Wanton, Prawn Balls etc. The soup tasted like lobster bisque. It was so rich and tasty that I finished the entitled bowl hahah. Overall, it was nice to have ramen in a totally different type of broth! The queue to get in however, was pretty long and I think we waited for about 30-35 minutes before we were seated (and that was because we were in the 1st seating of the evening). Was it worth it? I guess if you have always wanted to try Ramen in a not so common broth, then yes, go for it!! 4/5
While toppings are great and noodle is still perfect as I last remembered them to be, I\'d rather stick to my usual tonkotsu or tori broth. Just a matter of preference, I guess.
I really like the rich creamy broth. Going against the majority of opinions around me that the rich broth is way too heavy and salty, I ordered it and didn\'t regret a bit. The rich broth is the evidence of hard work in bringing the flavor of lobster all into the tasteless liquid, holding the rich essense of lobster all in one bowl. The taste of lobster infusing every drop of the thick liquid left me craving for more.
Very disappointed by the lobster ramen. I think chicken one is the best, so far.
But they didn\'t charge me for it their mistake so it\'s all good ü§ê I ordered Rich Lobster Broth Ramen, it was hella rich all right. So \"rich\" aka salty I had to constantly add hot water to my broth to dilute it. Pffff... Luckily I didn\'t had to queue for it üôÖüèª
we reached at 1730 to queue and were first 10 to enter. our noodles came quickly as well. the broth was very rich with lobster taste. the boiled egg and marinated bean sprouts were free flow.
This is a special that comes with all additional toppings, such as 2 pieces of halved soft boiled egg, prawn balls, prawn wanton, pork and chicken chashu, bamboo shoots and seaweed that goes really well with the very springy noodles!
Braved the queue (~20min) for Lobster King. Ordered the Miso Lobster Broth and Spicy Miso. While the miso in the lobster broth is a welcome addition to the normal rich soup, I still prefer the kick in the Spicy Miso version üòã 
But damn, the amount of ingredients in the ramen is deserving for its price. We both ordered the spicy miso ramen, with all toppings ($21.90) and from the first sip, you can taste the rich lobster stock. The beef tataki ($9.80) is pretty average but is a good dish to lighten up the entire meal as the ramen itself is already pretty rich. The chicken tanban ($9.80) on the other hand, is really favourful but ended up being too sickening for me towards the end of the meal. Overall, I would recommend this place as the ramen is indeed delicious as hell. I\'m so gonna try out the crab stock one soon üåö
The lobster broth played like an imperial relative of your prawn mee broth, whilst the gentle spicy miso kept the proceedings from venturing too deeply into the Atlantic Ocean. Elsewhere, the molten egg was seventy-two sorts of amazing, the pork belly kept his fatty and lean selves strictly separate, the black pepper wanton may need to refill his Bio-Essence Face Lifting Cream subscription and the prawn balls had more romantic mushiness than a Nicholas Sparks novel. 4.1/5
Thin, chewy strands of handmade ramen noodles lay relaxed and entwined, taking its time to soak in a broth of lobster, rich and intense, its flavors searing through our palates like a blazing sun in the sahara desert. Welcome to Ramen Keisuke Lobster King.
It was a good 1 hour wait just to get into the place and monster was hangry. \n<br />The bowl was practically filled to the brim with so many different components that monster could barely find the soup. \n<br />The rich broth had such an intense lobster flavor, Monster could almost hear the lobster claws knocking on his tongue, asking if it could book an Airbnb room. \n<br />Jokes aside, personally I feel the dish was too complicated and messy. Not that it\'s a bad thing. \n<br />Cause sometimes more stuff means more food for a #hungryhungrymonster \n<br />#keisukelobsterking
Our order for tonight are Spicy Miso lobster ramen (with full toppings), pork gyoza, garlic butter mushroom &amp; fluffy omelette rice (they forget this order üò•). This lobster broth is indeed thick and good but queue is terrible. #cuisineparadiseeatout #ramen #burpple
Was it worth the hype? Maybe. Since queueing is our national past time anyway. But this ramen tasted like a bowl of Japanese lobster bisque, with ramen in it. It was pretty well balanced and it came with two lobster balls stuffed with lobster meat, lobster meat wanton(?), and both chicken and pork chasu. It definitely looked like an overkill but it was well worth the calories, plus TGIF!
Queue started forming after 6.30pm but we were lucky we didn\'t have to wait long. Left with only one option for ramen, happened that we were planning to try the Lobster Broth Ramen (Rich Soup) option anyway. They were also out of beef tataki üò° \n<br />Anyhoo, service was prompt. Lobster ramen was so flavourful, like lobster bisque with an Asian twist and interestingly yuzu was added in. Thick, creamy and rich, might be too gelat for one. Got the Special for $20.90, comes with all toppings: pork belly, chicken chashu, black pepper prawn wanton - very empty probably burst open hahaha and crunchy bamboo shoot that was yummy but not so pleasant aftertaste, prawn balls (meh, weird texture) and flavoured egg. \n<br />Fluffy omelet rice ($10.80) saved the meal from getting a little too much with very gao prawn mee. Ketchup fried rice, drenched in brown sauce(?), so darn good! \n<br />Chicken Nanban ($9.80) - the Japanese tartar sauce was made on the spot (mayo, radish, onion, egg) and was actually really delish with the fried chicken, though it was sadly a little soggy. 
Unfazed by the long queue, we braved the strong wind and waited patiently for the famous lobster ramen that is causing such a stir amongst the ramen-lovers\' community and on Burpple. 
Fking love the lobster soup here, very rich and fulfilling. Plus the egg is the bomb chibaboom
Ordered the all toppings for 20.90. The broth is indeed excellent and I enjoyed it. The toppings are great too but I prefer the chasu to be more tender.
Like every outlet of Keisuke\'s, you get to DIY your ramen. I chose to have thick soup, hard noodle and less oil. This ramen comes w slices of chicken, bamboo shoots, prawn dumpling, fungus and egg (add $2).                               Overall i find the Soup: 4/5 (not too \"prawny\" taste), Total Cost: $16.90. P.S green tea cola is available here as well.
My picks are the pork gyoza, prawn gyoza, and fried rice, which can essentially be gotten elsewhere. I say don\'t bother about the sides (found most of them on the salty side) and go straight for what this newly-opened place is known for ‚Äì the Lobster Stock Ramen!
Encased inside is tomato rice with bits of chicken . Pity the marmite tasting brown sauce isn\'t to my likening ..but the egg portion is creamy üëçüèº\n<br />----------------------------\n<br />Hungry ? They are open from 6pm- 5am ! Ok u go eat while I go sleep üòùüòù‚úåüèºÔ∏è
Many of us are not unfamiliar with the hearty comforting yet affordable ramen Keisuke serves. This is their 10th outlet (!!) specialising in lobster infused broth paired with their springy ramen noodles. Not forgetting free flow bean spouts and hard boiled eggs! \n<br />My pick of the night would definitely be the rich and creamy Rich Lobster Ramen (from $14.90). If you had the Rich Crab stock from Keisuke Dining at Suntec, this is really similar to it! If not the Spicy Miso Lobster Ramen ($15.90) would be another favourites! \n<br />Fun fact that this is one outlet that only opens from 6pm but they close it 5AM!! So for those party late night peeps! Bookmark this for some super comforting late night supper (and to avoid the queue). Cheers guys! Happy mid-week! üçª
Located at The Cannery, Ramen Keisuke Lobster King (the 10th outlet in the Ramen Keisuke chain) is open till 5am daily ‚Äî perfect for refuelling after a night of dancing at Clark Quay. The menu is compact and fuss-free: choose from four different styles of ramen, all of which come with a French lobster base broth that has been simmered for six hours. Chilli fiends will love the Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($15.90), topped with tender pork belly, chicken char siew, black pepper prawn wantons and bamboo shoots. The tongue-numbing, flavourful broth is a blend of Sichuan sancho peppers, chilli oil and three types of miso, and is certainly not for the faint-hearted. Pro-tip: Douse the flames with the free flow of bean sprouts and boiled eggs.\n<br />Avg price: $18 per person
A modern Japanese dish, tomato rice covered in fluffy egg üçõ More info on the link in bio. ü§ì
tomato base, the excellently done egg, served out pipping hot. didn\'t really fancy the brown sauce though.
First full your tummy at Keisuke\'s 10th outlet, featuring a Lobster broth. This comes in 4 variants and personally, I preferred the \'rich\' version for its stronger umami flavours but I would go for a lighter broth so it wouldn\'t get so gelat towards the end. \n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #lobsterking #keisuke #ramen #gyoza #omurice #friedrice #8dayseat #onthetable #whati8today #setheats #tablesituation #sgsupper #supper #supperclub #japanesefood #japfood
#RamenKeisukeLobsterKing is officially open, as of 6pm today! Here\'s a look back at some of the highlights at the media preview earlier. @Ramen_Keisuke #LobsterKing
üò±
The Wasabi Ginger Ale [$4] raises eyebrows with its unique concoction found only at Ramen Keisuke. Retaining the fizziness of your average ginger ale [albeit a little less sweet], this ale takes things up a notch with a subtle aftertaste of wasabi. üì∑ @lingamajig
For the local-inspired creation, the Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen is created with blended spices and chilli such as spicy oil, Japanese Ichimi and Sichuan Sansho, making this set to be a more flavourful and aromatic broth designed for local taste-buds. 
We were warmly invited this past Wednesday night for a tasting event where we got to try their entire range of side dishes/rice dishes and 4 different kinds of lobster ramen. The restaurant is located at Clarke Quay and is at a perfect spot for late night goers or supper aficionados who crave for a bowl of hot piping ramen as it is opened till 5am in the morning.
Located in the heart of Clarke Quay and strategically opens from 6pm-5am, catering to the hungry night owls.
I like that the noodles are springy with bite which went well with the Lobster Miso broth that we got. The fatty cha shu and crispy prawn balls were on point!
Open daily from 6pm to 5am, party goers can get your ramen fix here at wee hours. üçú
To create the creamy texture and unique depth in flavour for the Lobster Broth Ramen with Rich Creamy Soup ($14.90), the stock brewing takes approximately 8 to 10 hours. We really enjoyed the richness and creamy texture of the broth from the latter. The velvety smooth broth slides down your throat so comfortingly. It‚Äôs so addictive that you can‚Äôt resist not slurping down even the last drop. As for the Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($15.90), the unique lobster broth is boiled with a special blend using three various types of miso while the curly ramen noodles served in this lobster creation are pan-fried by order. Chef Takeda is very particular about the standard of authenticity therefore he is very strict with regards to the kind of ramen noodles used for the differing flavours. Come by http://www.misstamchiak.com/ramen-keisuke-lobster-king/ for more details on Chef Takeda\'s latest outlet üòãüòç
.\n<br />Made from only the best French Rock lobster shells, the broth is essentially a rich lobster bisque with an asian twist. Catering to our sunny island\'s appetite for hot and spicy flavours, the chili adds extra oomph to its salty miso base.
Their ramen has been getting lots of attention, but let\'s not overlook this disarmingly delish Fluffy #Omelet Rice by Chef #Keisuke.
At the media launch of Ramen Keisuke Lobster King, and we\'re chopping down on these gyozas. \n<br />Tender minced meat, fresh springy prawn, and tasty juices oozing with each bite, this pan-fried trio is just right for a fragrant snack.
Ramen Keisuke Lobster King is officially open today! There are four options to choose from: Lobster Broth Ramen (Clear Soup), Lobster Broth Ramen (Rich Soup), Miso Lobster Broth Ramen and Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg 
#Ramen king Keisuke Takeda\'s 10th and largest outlet in Singapore, #RamenKeisuke #LobsterKing located at #ClarkQuay, is officially launching 20 Feb. This 62-seater outlet is also the first late night dining outlet under the group (daily 6pm-5am).
üòã \n<br />The Miso Lobster broth really hits the spot! üòâ\n<br />I\'ve got to admit, the lobster-based broth really sets itself apart from most traditional pork/chicken-based ramen broth. If you\'re into the Sapporo-style of ramen, you\'ll probably love this! \n<br />What\'s more, the opening hours are from 6pm to 5am! Never miss your midnight cravings for ramen ever again! üçúüòú
A new option to fill your tummy before/after a night of clubbing is now open at Clarke Quay. Ramen Keisuke Lobster King serves up ‚ÄúFrench influenced Lobster Stock Ramen‚Äù from 6pm to 5am daily. Choose from a range of side dishes including Gyoza, Omelette Rice, Fried Chicken and Beef Tatami then customise your own Ramen with one of four soup bases and toppings of your choice.
Available in 4 different styles, diners can select either the Lobster Broth Ramen with Clear Soup ($13.90), Lobster Broth Ramen with Rich Creamy Soup ($14.90), Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($14.90, pictured here) or Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($15.90). By going for the full works, you will not only get the quintessential pork belly, there‚Äôs also chicken char siew, black pepper prawn wontons, lobster balls, bamboo shoots and an onsen egg.
{Spicy MISO Lobster broth Ramen spicy} at the new joint Ramen Keisuke Lobster King which opens for their grand launch on the 20th Feb. Open till 5am daily,  it\'s pretty much perfect for the after party. - tips: steer clear of their hard as rock pork chashu and get another flavored egg instead OR fill up on the free flow boiled eggs at the table!\n<br />‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°\n<br />#whati8today #eatoutsg #burpple #instafood_sg
Given how much I adore the original Ramen Keisuke, I was really excited to try their Lobster King concept. 
The lobster broth played like an imperial relative of your prawn mee broth, whilst the gentle spicy miso kept the proceedings from venturing too deeply into the Atlantic Ocean. Elsewhere, the molten egg was seventy-two sorts of amazing, the pork belly kept his fatty and lean selves strictly separate, the black pepper wanton may need to refill his Bio-Essence Face Lifting Cream subscription and the prawn balls had more romantic mushiness than a Nicholas Sparks novel. 4.1/5
Each bowl comes with a slice of tender pork belly, chicken char siew (surprisingly good), black pepper prawn wontons topped with crunchy bamboo shoots, all in a deep lobster bisque like soup base.
This bowl of ramen from @ramen_keisuke is probably one with the most generous ingredients - but taste wise... Okok only la.
Okok lor, but good to share for 2 cause it\'s soooo filling!
Isn‚Äôt these the basics to all ramen?
Shooo good! Oiishi!
Shiok! But i still prefer the original soup base at Orchird Hotel thou better than the crab soup base... #ramen #keisuketonkotsuking #keisuke #lobsterking #lobsterkingramen #throwback #latergram #qiangxxuan #japanesefood #japfood #clarkequay #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodreview #foodporn #food #foodie #burpplesg #burpple
[Ramen Keisuke Lobster King] Gotta love not the lobster broth ramen, but more so the delectable Omu Rice, from Ramen Keisuke\'s Clarke Quay outlet.

In frame\'s the Fluffy Omelet Rice ($10.8) from @Ramen_Keisuke\'s 10th &amp; 2nd largest (62 seater) outlet; Lobster King located @clarkequaysg less that a min from the taxi stand. And yes, that\'s how they spell omelette yah. Anyway you call it, I personally would affectionately call this a Omu Rice. Hidden beneath all that delectable butter laden brown gravy &amp; perfecto omelette\'s a very nicely done ketchup based fried rice with chicken + prawn bits that\'s so good I came back a 2nd visit jus for this; definitely wouldn\'t mind going again for a 3rd 4th or many more subsequent times!\n<br />~\n<br />PS: This is the only @Ramen_Keisuke chains that\'s open evenings &amp; closes way into the wee hours so late nite clubbing hungry pangs; no worries yah.\n<br />*tagging both people who was here with me on separate occasions for convenience sake (LOL) &amp; we NEED to go back for this yah (you know who you are). And to the lady who makes me want to have this so much after seeing you post this on IG, you know who you are too eh (enjoy yourself in the land of the rising sun üòªüòª).\n<br />~\n<br />Pic taken @Ramen_Keisuke Lobster King\n<br />@clarkequaysg\n<br />3C River Valley Road\n<br /># 01-07\n<br />Singapore 179022\n<br />Phone: 6255 2928\n<br />Operating Hours: 6pm - 5am Daily\n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KeisukeTokyoSG\n<br />Website: http://www.keisuke.sg/lobster-king-clarke-quay\n<br />Email: keisuke_sg@singnet.com.sg\n<br />~
Best amongst all in the chains so far
Back again for more üçú\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.
strong lobster flavour. can even scoop up bits of lobster meat in the soup. Q-ness of noodles just right. \n<br />overall quite below expectations, esp the meat and other liao. somehow everything just don\'t go well together. become more and more jerlat towards the end. \n<br />the free-flow taogey deserves a üëç
Lighter on the palate as it was not as \'jerlat\' as the rich soup!\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, rmb to try their #omurice! It was as good as the ones I had in üáØüáµ\n<br />.\n<br />#awesome #bestoftheday #burpple #delicious #eeeeeats #eatoutsg #feedfeed #f52grams #foodporn #foodstagram #foodgasm #foodphotography #happytummy #instadaily #instafood #igsg #igers #japanesefood #lobsterramen #nomnomnom #onthetable #potd #ramen #ramenkeisuke #sgigfoodies #sgfoodies #sgfood #vscofood

It is much thicker and flavorsome and you can choose all toppings to savour lavish ingredients such as pork belly, chicken char siew and prawns wontons to complement the springy noodles
I loved it, @zh_kwok hated it. With broth so thick, this is the kind of food they divides people. The lovers, and the haters. #noregrets #burpple #wheredoyoustand #teammystic
This is way better than kani king, not so salty. I will definitely go back again. üòçüòç #throwback #food #foodie #foodpic #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodgram #foodstagram #foodporn #foodcoma #instafood #foodlover #japanesefood #ramen #burpple

brought the mama and had clear soup version this time round. lacks the oomph factor and feels like a atas bowl of prawn mee soup. haha. but i\'d still probably choose this over the rich soup, cus that is just too rich. the mama likes her bowl of rich broth though. #eachtohisown
lobster broth ramen, rich soup version. you\'ll love this if you love lobster bisque. too rich and overwhelming for my liking though. nonetheless a good ramen with plenty of ingredients, pity there\'s no lobster meat. haha.
Need a legit travel buddy I can trust, someone üôÑ
Go-to ramen place 
definitely coming back for more!! üòç
Officially this has become my number 1 favourite ramen to go to for an absolutely slurpinglicious ramen experience in Singapore! \n<br />Every single thing was on point here (Lobster Broth Ramen (Rich Soup) ) - be it the chewy ramen, the rich and thick broth, the runny egg, the extremely tender char siew, PERFECT!
#misolobsterbrothramen #shioklikemad #burpple #mrmochi
But I prefer the rich broth rather than miso. #burpple
Chef Keisuke Takeda have been opening famous ramen stall in sg. Well this is one of the latest beside the crab broth ramen. If you are looking for heavy taste ramen, this would be the ramen for you. The interesting part is that you could taste the lobster. So I could say it is not like those gimmick dishes, where you can taste nothing. If you prefer those lighter taste , there is a lighter version of it. However the ramen is abit too short. It\'s like eating magi Mee not shiok at all Lor and the charashi I still prefer Marutama, where is melt in the mouth kind. Overall I still think is worth the try. \n<br />Ps: the crowd have not die down yet so get ready to be in a Long queue.
The broth simply failed to capture the essence of the lobster flavour, and tasted pretty much like hae mee tng (which im pretty sure I can get better ones elsewhere) and the lack of even a hint of lobster in this entire bowl really made me question why i queued 1 hour and paid $20 for this bowl of ramen. Especially disappointed particularly so because it\'s part of the Keisuke franchise and Tori King was really good. This is one example of only trusting your own judgements (tastebuds in this case), no matter what others tell you. #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #lobster #lobsterbroth #keisuke #keisukeramen #keisukelobster #lobsterking #burpple

Rich Creamy Lobster Broth Ramen ($20.90) :\n<br />The umami broth that is filled with flavors of the lobster. Heard that the clear soup base takes 6 hours to cook, while this rich creamy soup base takes around 10 to 12 hours.

customization for your ramen
It came with all additional toppings, such as 2 pieces of halved softboiled eggs, prawn wantons, pork and chicken chashu, bamboo shoots and seaweed!

Unique broth taste! Must try! Cons: waiting time. 
Queued 1.5 hours for this! 
Keisuke seems to be doing all the right things with long snaking queues at all his newer outlets.
:-)
The thick and creamy lobster broth is absolutely delectable and each spoonful is just delightfully satisfying. Be prepared to queue though.
üç¥ through the fluffy omelette, in it reveals ketchup fried rice with chicken and prawns with laden brown sauce on top.

Just an average bowl of soggy ramen in a watered-down broth not worth the long queues. #lobster #ramen #latergram #hungrygowhere #vscocam #foodvsco #sgfoodies #sgfood #igsg #openricesg #tslmakan #burpple  #onthetable #straitstimeslife #throwback #sgfoodporn
Hectic weekends again. Anyway, being #ramenkeisuke regular, managed to try their very newly raved outlet.. Started to join queue 5.40, only got less den 20 ppls in front and lots of empty seats inside but they let ppls in very slowly and only get to order around 6.20... when ramen come free egg tray left 1 egg only. üòÇ this outlet got much more varieties, curry rice, fried dumplings and many more. Tired thick (14++) full topping (19++) and clear (13++) lobster soup base. Thick version is stronger flavour; thus, better and tasted like french lobster soup. Really quite special but if weather is hot n very long queue maybe prefer to go their other outlet. shop only open 6pm-5am no lunch timing. #sgfood #foodsg #lobsterramen #lobsterking #burpple
Cheers to lovely sweet weekends
After Q-ing for an hour finally had the chance to slurp this bowl of üçú down\n<br />.\n<br />Super rich with umami goodness like a very strong prawn noodle stock üòª, for those who prefer something lighter, go for the miso or the clear soup üëçüèª\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burps #clarkequay #eatoutsg #exploresingapore #exsgfood #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #foodgasm #goodeats #happytummy #instadaily #instafood #instayum #lobster #lobsterramen #nomnnomnom #openrice #onthetable #potd #ramen #ramenkeisuke #sgfg #sgeats #sgigfoodies #tslmakan #vscosg #vscofood
Besides the Lobster Stock Ramen¬†[available in 4 different styles - Lobster Broth Ramen with Clear Soup ($13.90), Lobster Broth Ramen with Rich Creamy Soup ($14.90), Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($14.90) &amp; Spicy Miso Lobster Broth Ramen ($15.90)], there are a good selection of sake and alcohol as well. This 62 seater raman outlet is open daily from 6pm to 5am in Clarke Quay. Now you know where to go for ur late night ramen craving. Just a stone throw away from the taxi stand loh. Hard to miss with the beautiful Japanese deco.
This omu rice happened to be one of our favorite things here.
Today\'s such a perfect weather to have a good bowl of hot ramenüç≤ The spicy miso lobster broth ramen soup is created with blended spices and chilli which is suitable for all those who are a fan of chilli‚ô®
The flavour is there but I\'d have preferred a more even meat-to-rice ratio as well as more sauce. Easy tweaks to make this dish stand out more! \n<br />Thanks @munchingmarc for extending the invite!\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #lobsterking #keisuke #ramen #gyoza #omurice #friedrice #8dayseat #onthetable #whati8today #setheats #tablesituation #sgsupper #supper #supperclub #japanesefood #japfood
Open daily from 6pm to 5am. Now you know where to head to after partyüòâ
Tomato rice was just a tad overcooked üòÇ so, save for the fluffy omelette and savoury sweet brown sauce, I would advice you to skip this rice dish in favor of the miso lobster broth Ramen at the new joint\n<br />‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #i8mondays #sgfoodporn #jiaklocal
So many sides, don\'t know what to try? Fret not, we\'ve got it.

Yeah! Not hot or cold green tea or even cola but \"Japanese green tea cola\"!! Indeed a whole new experience to me. #ramenkeisuke #lobsterking #ramenking #ramen #japanese #japanesefood #jacelynadverts #burpple
This is not a usual bowl of ramen, the soup which was being used for the ramen are cooked up to 6 hrs. What\'s best is it\'s not too oily and minimum amount of MSG has been added into it. The ingredients used are super fresh too.
opens til 5am daily and you can get your hunger fix after club or late night drinks. üòèüòèüòè party goers, you\'re not forgotten.
In that, I rest assured that my self is fully appreciated in his eyes\n<br />‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°\n<br />{Mince on Rice} a less menacing option on the Keisuke Ramen Lobster King\'s side menu featuring steamed rice sitting snugly in a tight bowl underneath crumbly mounds of pork mince. A ten-fold healthier version of the  Âç§ËÇâÈ•≠ which I indulged in a few days back and much less gratifying\n<br />‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #sipandgulp #sgfoodporn#RamenKeisuke #RamenKing #LobsterKing
