As you slowly break apart the egg, the runny and gooey yolk flows through and the sight of it is enough to awake your tastebuds
This time trying out their beer-infused pizza, ‚ÄúThe Fun Guys‚Äù.. It‚Äôs quite nice imo and the mushrooms forms a perfect fit with the pizza dough.. Will come back again to try other pizzas!
Currently my favourite place to chill out with peeps.. Cosy place with 1-for-1 Sapporo before 7pm and nice food to feast.. Anyone wants to chill out one of these days?
