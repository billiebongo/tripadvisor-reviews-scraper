Love the tiki vibes here! Spicy salmon and tuna combi was good, based with layer of brown and white rice. Price a little steep for a pok√© bowl ($18). Would probably try their customisable lunch bowls on my next visit.
üå¥üå∫üç£ü•ó‚ú® Hehe. Selected the Spicy Salmon (fave!!) which packs quite the fiery kick üî• and Wasabi Mayo Tuna onto my chosen base of sushi rice, 2 complimentary toppings of cucumber and flying fish roe and avocado for complimentary superfood! The staff tops every customized bowl off with pineapple cubes and scallions and a wedge of lime. Perfection üíØüíØüíØ #dqky #burpple
Was disappointed to learn that the customisable bowls are only available for lunch. Although I would still prefer to be able to pick my ingredients, I can\'t complain much about this bowl.
Big Kahuna ($19.90) - 3 scoops, 225g of Poke üç£ü•ó.\n<br />üç¥Generous bowl of perfectly seasoned fresh sashimi &amp; vegetables. Healthy &amp; delicious &amp; customizable to suit your personal taste ‚≠êÔ∏è4.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
Aloha Pok√© probably holds 1st place as my favourite pok√© place in Singapore. 
More expensive than A pok√© theory and limited choices of vegetables. The portion was also rather small, esp the amount of rice it was pretty little. Otherwise glad to have a vegetarian option of sesame marinated tofu that was quite tasty.
No ingredient is an afterthought at Aloha Pok√©, making this our favourite stop for a pok√© bowl. The seasoning is always spot on, the bite-sized pineapples and the wedge of lime that come on the side balance out the savoury marinades ‚Äî little touches that set the bar high for pok√©s in town. The Standard Nalu ($15.90) gets you two scoops of tuna or salmon cubes tossed in original (yummy), spicy (will make you work up a sweat) or wasabi (less spicy, also yummy) marinade. Choose a base of greens, white rice, brown rice or mixed rice. To complete your meal, we recommend the flying fish roe and the edamame as your choice of complimentary toppings and avocado as your complimentary superfood. While there are two other outlets within the CBD (Marina Bay Link Mall and Chevron House), our favourite is still this Amoy Street outlet which offers The Ultimate Pok√© Bowl ($18) at dinner. It features a generous heaping of crowd favourite toppings on a bed of your choice, served in a large wooden salad bowl. While there\'s no option of customising the toppings, you still get to choose the fish and the marinade you\'d like. \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Reiko Lee
Flavourful yet healthy meals are always welcome. Like this Ultimate Pok√© Bowl. We had Original Salmon and Spicy Tuna over salad and brown rice. The spicy tuna livened up the dish with a little kick and everything just worked well together. Plus the staff were super friendly. Will definitely be back for more.\n<br />#AlohaPokeSG
Could have been much more generous with the toppings for a salad that is S$11.90 (salad at Amoy is half the price but so much more toppings &gt; yes, trekking date soon @valeriekoh_ üòò
Came here for their dinner service and was so disappointed with the ultimate pok√© bowl ($20++ smth like that). Skip this and order the chawa-hawaii and salmon salad instead. Those were definite winners!
A pok√© bowl filled with all your favourite ingredients...punched by goodness and yummies...and get a poke of power foods! 
This tasted a bit like Chirashi Don (choice of salmon/tuna) but instead it\'s filled w lots of salad. I\'ll sure be back for more!! üòã #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #takemymoney
Healthy but yummy lunch at CBD, fuss free for takeaway as well. To order:\n<br />1. Choose bowl size \n<br />2. Choose base (white/brown/mix rice)\n<br />3. Choose protein (tuna/salmon)\n<br />4. Choose flavour (original/spicy/wasabi)\n<br />5. Choose 2 add-ons (eg, edamame, almond)\n<br />6. Choose superfood (eg avocado, pomegranate).\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Interestingly, all bowls taste good regardless of how it was customised! This is perhaps due to the use of fresh fishes that tastes flavourful due to the use of marinate, and the mix of textures depending on what you\'ve added. #pokebowl #hawaiian #alohapoke
Almost worth looking forward to the work week for... If I were working anywhere near that is.
Still my fav Pok√© bowl around, Aloha Pok√©\'s simple range of fresh seafood and refreshing sides just makes for a satisfying, guilt-free meal. üòõ
If I had the money, I would probably eat this everyday.
$15.90 for a standard nalu with a choice of two fish, salad or rice, 2 toppings and 1 superfood surely sounds like a good deal to me :-) got the spicy salmon and original ahi tuna on a bed of salad, topped with fish roe, avocado and cherry tomatoes!!!! Although I felt that the seasoning on the fish was a bit too salty, it was nonetheless fresh and aloha was generous with their portions! I will come back here again, because this place not only offers healthy yet flavorful bowls but is an excellent place to go to chill with friends
Possibly (especially with the generous serving of greens). I was super excited because we chould choose the vegetables for the DIY bowl. In the end we chose Rice Mix with Wasabi Mayo Ahi Tuna and Original Salmon, topped with edamame, cherry tomatoes and pomegranate. I found the Original was still the best flavour although I love spicy food. It was refreshing thanks to the pineapples, scallions and dash of lime juice ‚Äî living up the Hawaiian feel. The seemingly tiny bowl was pretty filling I must say!
There were so much veg and super foods, and my favorite salmon and tuna. It\'s a pretty decent portion for just $18. üòå
Came here based on recommendations from Burpple. The place was packed! And They ran out of fish when we arrived and the Chef had to bring it over from their other outlet lol. My first poke experience and I do like the idea of a healthy bowl of brown rice with fresh sashimi.
Brown rice and salad, Wasabi Mayo Salmon, Garlic Prawns, Edamame, Flying Fish Roe, Avocado, topped off with scallions, pineapple and lime
$18 for dinner bowl. The flavor is on point! I dislike raisins in my food but surprisingly it made everything in the bowl taste goood!
After run dinner. They have a different menu from lunch. 
It\'s a balance meal on a bowl, filled with tasty brown and white rice topped with lots of fresh salads, spicy salmon and original tuna, topped with cherry tomatoes, and fish roe, garnished by sweet pineapple chunks. Lovely on the eyes and on my tummy. Will come back for more 
Tried lil s\'well which consisted of 1 scoop of spicy salmon, avocados, cherry tomatoes, edamame, pineapples, lime, spring onions &amp; salad. Salmon was marinated to perfection üòã
For 150g of raw fish and choice of salad veg or rice and additional toppings, $15.90 may be a little pricey. But still worth the try!! Had a mix of spicy salmon and wasabi mayo samlon which seemed a bit overpowering, esp the spicy one! May mix original with 1 other flavoured fish next time instead! Avoid the queue by going after 130pm!

Aloha!! Haven\'t got a chance to fly to Hawaii to try their Pok√© Bowl. However I managed to find a Gem in Singapore that serves it!! Aloha Pok√© &amp; this is their Ultimate Pok√© Bowl. ($18) During lunch you can mix &amp; match the types of fish you prefer. Here I have Original Ahi Tuna &amp; Spicy Salmon. \n<br />.\n<br />The only thing that can replace Chirashi / Kisendon. Actually... The Pok√© bowl is on a league of its own. üòã
The baked avocados come with two different types of cheese, parma ham and fish roe. The awesome combination is so buttery, cheesy and yummy! If you love cheese and avocado, you must not miss this! üòÄüíï\n<br />Full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/02/19/aloha-poke-hawaiian-deliciousness/ (active link at bio)
Thankful for most-things-we-take-for-granted like FRESH PRODUCE in a bowl, blessed to be indoors and sheltered from the erratic weather. It\'s about enjoying the little things and eating to your heart\'s content.  \n<br />13.9-19.9bucks/bowl
Go for the standard 2 scoops of fishies or you will deeply regret it!
The result is the most delicious bite of luncheon meat that you would have ever tasted in your whole life. One serving of musubi comes with six pieces for S$11.\n<br />See full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/02/19/aloha-poke-hawaiian-deliciousness/
Awesome mix of flavored salmon/tuna with salad, avos, pineapple &amp; flying fish roes. $15.9 for the medium bowl.
Anticipate a busy work day? Plan ahead so you can still eat well for lunch! Gather your colleagues to pre-order poke bowls a day in advance via email (minimum three orders), and just send someone out to pick it up at lunch time. Go for the standard Nalu (two scoops, $15.90) ‚Äî 150g of tuna and salmon cubes tossed in original marinade on a bed of brown rice. Top it off with some avocado, flying fish roe and cherry tomatoes. For the full Hawaiian experience, toss the bite-sized pineapples and scallions together with your poke bowl and finish off with a spritz of lime juice! 
The sashimi was well marinated and I\'m super in ‚ù§Ô∏è with the spicy salmon. At @alohapokesg , you get a choice of 1 scoop of 75g Poke (11.90) Standard Nalu ($15.90) with 2 scoops of 150g Poke and Big Kahuna ($19.90) with 3 scoops of 225g Poke. However big the scoop, you can also get complimentary superfood and add ons. üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº. Thanks for the pleasant meal. #tgif
Some might say \"this is a salad, it has veggies!\". To me it\'s a tastier option that fills you up and keeps your insides clean. The ahi tuna was super fresh and tasty. I had the spicy one. I could eat this everyday.
A salad and rice bowl combined.
Finally made it here to try this, and it is good! Tasty marinated tuna &amp; salmon cubes (I picked the wasabi &amp; spicy options), topped with salad, edamame, flying fish roe, avocado, pineapples, over a bed of rice.
The combination of this poke bowl is superb. I love how refreshing and appetizing the sauce is. Salmon sashimi is fresh too. I don\'t mind driving down just to get a bowl to satisfy my cravings. 
Clean but delicious. And basically containing all my favorite things - brown rice, tobiko roe, mango, avocados, salmon, tuna... The generous amount of fish (and basically everything!) made this super worth the $15.90 I paid for the medium size. This definitely kept me full all the way to dinner time. 
The most tender and delicious slice of braised beef drizzled with red wine and addictive Japanese nitsumi sauce, with a piece of fried egg on top of sushi rice. This is just simply so SHIOK...! See the new article on Aloha Pokƒì at www thehungrygeek.com
Is this really Hawaiian food? I\'m not sure but I would like to truly believe that it is because I cannot afford to go to Hawaii to find out just yet. The ultimate pok√© bowl ($18) (that was the only pok√© bowl option...) includes 2 flavors of fish (salmon &amp; tuna). This legit tasted like chirashi don mixed with a bibimbap but so good I have no idea what sauce they used because I have no talent for being able to taste ingredients out (0 points to me). The rice wasn\'t as sticky like jap/Korean rice, it had a good bite to it like u could taste every grain which I liked!! They were v generous with the toppings too!!! We also ordered the kalua pig burrito ($18) - OMG!!!!!!!!! the pulled pork was the bomb I totally ignored the other ingredients in the burrito cos the pulled pork was so good all I savored was the pulled pork hah. Shoutout to all restaurants though pls don\'t use such dim lightings in your place I wanna take good pics!!!! Pls!!!
Super yummy detox meal after the feasting of CNY. Had mine with brown rice, which was cooked well with a nice bite to it. Diced mangos provided a bit of sweetness, and walnuts, cherry tomatoes and other assorted toppings rounded it all out well. $18 is rather steep even for dinner despite the very generous amounts of fish, but their DIY lunch bowls are cheaper and look üëåüèªüëåüèª definitely coming back to create my own. 
Say aloha to the food trend that is sweeping all across the world ‚Äî poke (pronounced \'poh-kay\'). A staple of the Hawaiian islands for centuries, poke bowls are salads that feature marinated raw fish, much like its chirashi counterparts from Japan. In fact, the original poke flavour that sees the freshly cut sashimi cubes tossed in a sweet marinade, is a nod to the strong Japanese influence on the Hawaiian islands. While yellow fin tuna is the default choice of fish in Hawaii, Aloha Poke also offers salmon as an alternative base, alongside a vegetarian option. For lunch, choose from three different sizes (one, two or three scoops of poke). Go for the standard Nalu (2 scoops, $15.90) with this winning combination ‚Äî 150g of original tuna and wasabi mayo salmon with brown rice and avocado, topped with flying fish roe and cherry tomatoes. Every bowl comes with a slice of lime, bite-sized pineapples and scallions on the side. You may also opt for the spicy flavour if you prefer some heat. Come by in the evening for the Roasted Pork Belly ($12) served with pineapple cubes, washed down with either a pint of ice cold Hawaiian Kona Beer ($13.90) or a Mauna Loa cocktail ($18) at the newly launched Tiki Bar (in a cute Tiki mug of course)! Pro tip: order your salads one day in advance via email to beat the queue.

The razor-crisp salty skin had a stickiness that would likely engage your teeth in a frenzied dance while elsewhere, each piece of the tender meat commits harakiri within your mouth and splits into more segments for your chewing pleasure, and the charred pineapple cubes were on hand for some soft, juicy Hawaiian cheer. 3.9/5
Happy New Year! Wishing that Aloha Pok√© was open today so we can satisfy our craving for their mouthwatering pok√© bowls!
Generous portion of sashimi that is perfectly seasoned and tasted simply delicious. 
At @alohapokesg you can also get seasoned salmon in your Pok√© along with some tobiko and superfood like avocado, pomegranate etc. The bowl is then topped with very sweet pieces of pineapple. In summary, this is like a tropical, souped up barachirashi. You can have your choice of sushi rice or salad (for those wanting less carbs). It also comes in 3 sizes for people of varying appetites or for sharing. The seasoned salmon did get a little too salty at the end of the meal. Was it an enjoyable meal? Yes. Would I make a trip all the way to Amoy Street for this? Not really. It would be a treat if you are around the area. \n<br />#burpple
Faced with a barrage of chirashi offerings, what\'s next for us jaded (blessed) foodies? Enter the poke (say po-kay) -- a same-same-but-different concept fast becoming the latest foodie fad in Singapore. Essentially a Hawaiian variant of marinated fresh fish salad, the pokes offered here include tuna and salmon (in original, spicy, and wasabi mayo flavours), plus a vegetarian option (tofu with nutty sesame). From three sizes priced $11.90 upwards, customise your very own poke bowl with choice ingredients ranging from tobiko and edamame to skin-loving ones like avocado, pomegranate and chia seeds. 
NO REGRETS GUYS. The original flavoured tuna was nicely marinated and it\'s texture was even smoother than salmon!!! If you\'re ever in the vicinity, you have to try this! üòçüòçüòçüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª #burpple
Pok√©, a raw fish salad in Hawaiian cuisines typically served with sesame seeds, sweet onions and scallion. This newly-opened eatery specializes in pok√© bowls, with 3 sizes and 4 types of proteins to choose from (tuna, salmon, seasonal fish and vegetarian option of tofu in nutty sesame sauce), base (white, brown or mix rice, or just salad) with complimentary 2 toppings and a superfood (avocado, pomegranate, chia seed or quail egg). I opted for the Standard Nahu (usual price $15.90, and chose wasabi mayo+ tuna &amp; salmon - which was fresh!)topped with pineapples making it a pretty refreshing salad. They\'re having 20% off for their soft launch.
Had mine with brown rice, wasabi mayo salmon and spicy salmon. The fish is sliced freshed daily and they were super generous with the amount of salmon in my poke. Had a bite of my friend\'s tuna too and it wasn\'t fishy tasting at all which surprised me.
A healthy bowl with a delicious crunch. Try their spicy salmon poke on brown rice then topped with avocado, pineapple, cherry tomato &amp; flying fish roe. Highly recommended, the best poke bowl! 
Choose from 3 sizes, Lil\' swell, Standard Nalu and Big Kahuna which offers 1 to 3 scoops of poke, my eyes lit up at the various types of ahi tuna, salmon and the seasonal options.\n<br />Pick a base, 2 complimentary Add-Ons and 1 complimentary Superfood and your poke bowl is ready to go!\n<br />.\n<br />üè¢200 Victoria Street Bugis Junction 04-01  Singapore 188021\n<br />.\n<br />üïöOpening Hours: \n<br />Daily: 11.30am to 8.30pm\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤Cost: $11.90, $15.90, $19.90\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #igfood #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #igfoodies #foodgram #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #vscofeed #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #exploresingapore #singapore #singaporefoodie #burpple #burpplesg

Poke-y? it\'s pronounced as Poh-Kay! well regardless what it\'s called, it\'s definitely a big bowl of healthy yet extremely delicious and somewhat even addictive mix of super(good)foods. chose the Wasabi Ahi (Tuna) and Spicy Salmon in this Ultimate Poke Bowl which can be shared with a friend if you, like me, like to order a whole lot of other items on the menu to try. i can\'t help being greedy üòã and boy, just look at all those colors. how pleasing to the eyes, isn\'t it? @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @alohapokesg #alohapoke #salmon #tuna #salad #pokebowl #healthyeating #healthyliving

Immerse yourself in the Hawaiian culture by having some pok√© for lunch when you are in the CBD area. Pok√© is a dish that contains fresh raw seafood, cuts of Ahi Tuna or Salmon in this case, that has been flavoured with spices and paired with other ingredients such as salad, rice and other foods.
You poke it. Hehe. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#Burpple #alohapoke #poke #salmon #ricebowl #lunch #singapore #hawaiianpoke #healthy #delicious #foodporn #instafood #foodstagram #instadaily #eatgreen #seafood

This ultimate poke bowl just make us more hungry and craving for more. We could not decide on whether to eat white or brown so we ordered both Lor. Topped up with Super food wasabi salmon and spicy tuna and ending it with a bit of citrus lime to make it more appetising.  But cannot Everyday eat, or else I also go poke kai.
I am back from my trip! Time to eat some clean food to clear my diet. \n<br />This is my first time trying this dessert. You could still taste the Berry with each mouthful. It\'s so refreshing! The fruits are there to sweeten the dessert as there is no sugar added! What\'s best is this dessert can cool you down with minimal calories gain! üòã
#onsenegg #salmon #burpple
First time visiting so didn\'t realise they had a different concept at night. Fortunately I could still do takeaway just less customisations. And I\'m glad I walked so far, because the Hawaiians know how to up the chirashi game. The addition of avocados, tomatoes, lettuce, etc was a welcome complement to the marinated raw fish for an overall more balanced and fulfilling meal.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #poke #hawaiianpoke #chirashi #cbd #salad #saladbowl #burpple
There we have it - my delicious salad comprising romaine lettuce, kale, salmon, dried grapes, pineapple cubes, edamame, pomegranite and tomatoes.....slowly devoured over a bottle of light, sweet pale ale lager.... This is life. A toast to a sensational Saturday ahead *clinks*
Essentially a salmon and/or tuna barachirashi don with a Hawaiian twist of extra salad and pieces of cut pineapple (plus other non-Japanese-y add-ons). And heavily marinated with spicy sesame sauce should u choose to go for that flavour. This nutritious mix of seasoned sashimi and fruity salad definitely gets my \"okay\"...
Healthy choice üëç#food#foodporn#burpple#salad \n<br />#foodie#Singapore#instafood_sg\n<br />#foodstagram#instafood#salmon
Yes!
Poke is marinated raw fish and is very similar to sashimi due to the strong Japanese influence on Hawaii.
Got the #spicytuna and #wasabimayo #salmon for my Pok√©, along with brown rice and avocado. It\'s pretty much everything I love in a bowl. No wonder it didn\'t taste anything like a salad! #sgfoodie #foodporn
