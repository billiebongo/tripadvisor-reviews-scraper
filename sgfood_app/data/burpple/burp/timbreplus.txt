Got this to go from the Teppei Daidokoro at Timbre+ - mostly because it was convenient and you can\'t really go wrong with a Teppei bowl. The salmon, tuna, scallop and some kind of whelky shell fish was very well seasoned, actually borderline too salty - but nice. All this sat on a bed of seaweed and Japanese rice and topped with ikura.
Felt like trying something different so went for the dry ban mee from the ban mian stall. I liked the rich flavours of the sauce &amp; the mix of the crunchy &amp; tasty Ikan bilis &amp; shallots. A cheap &amp; good meal ‚≠êÔ∏è 3.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
It was..okay lah, with the actual meats hits and odd tasting balls, misses but we waited almost an hour for the food üòûget the salted egg fries which are half off if you buy a set (only 4 bucks!!)\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Taste (6/10)\n<br />Service (4/10)\n<br />Overall (5/10)
Fork tender mutton that was supremely flavourful. The curry was kept separate as it really packed a punch. The lamb and rice by itself is already impressive, but try it with the raita and curry--its a completely different experience!
Loving the kick from the sweet, spicy and savoury sauce and as usual, the delicious crisp from their wings. We prefer their salted egg yolk sauce though, looking forward to trying them again! ü§§
This was just their regular sized bowl without the drink ($4.50). I really loved how bouncy and QQ the fishballs were, and how the fishcake had bits of chili and other stuff (spring onion?) in it. The mee pok noodles were of the thinner variant which was quite average tasting, but didn\'t put down the dish as a whole. In fact, I felt that the average noodles made me appreciate the bouncy fishballs even more üòã.
Although they gave plenty of rice but the chicken meat given is very little and filled mainly with bones and just a thin slice of meat. Definitely not worth the money to try.
\nIt\'s Cookie Crumble Brulee French Toast by Udders! It\'s been a few years since the last time I ate at Udders and I was tempted to try this menu. The top of the french toast was covered with hard caramel and vanilla ice cream with oreo cookies. Around it was whipped cream and lotus biscuits üòç There\'s definitely so much going on in this plate and u just have to savour every single element üòÜ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤: $10
The Wagyu itself is not tender enough while the sauce is good enough to cover that.
First time at timbre+ and wanted to try Paella from Portico Platos. But was turned away because they weren\'t ready at 1120. I think it\'s ok to be not ready but you shouldn\'t be rude to potential customers? \"We will only be ready at 1145.\" So I asked \"are you asking me not to order?\" And he said \"yup\". And all I wanted was hot food since it\'s one of the rare chances I\'m out of my freezing lab.
A neatly shaped nasi lemak cube. With legit eggs and otah. And not forgetting the sambal chilli on top.
Made a special trip down. Good food under one roof! Upclass foodcourt at night
Lunch time and in need of a quick and comforting meal. 
Slathered with sauce, the salmon belly ($3.80 each) definitely stood out for being tender soft yet crispy on the outside.
Delicious fried rice reminiscent of my JC days. The auntie takes order by batch when there\'s a crowd. There\'s no orderly queue because auntie will just ask everyone what they want and proceed to dish them out accordingly. As they only sell a few dishes, this is one of the fastest stalls here.
Only one store selling this. Prefer Ya kun\'s toast. The toast here isn\'t that crispy and the kaya is so-so. Overall quite tasteless
.\n<br />Good food are meant to be shared. The salted egg yolk wings from @twowingssg lived up to the hype with its creamy none-too-overpowering salted egg coating upon crispy wings and drumlets. Few places can master the recipe of salted egg sauce well. But Two Wings has definitely nailed it; which is bound to leave salted-yolk fans craving for more.
Happening today, you can enjoy a meaty cut of black miso seared tuna¬†at the #FestivalForGood organised by the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprises (raiSE), which aims to raise awareness of F&amp;B social enterprises. A visual treat, Gar√ßons‚Äô rendition of the¬†salad nicoise was paired with bright yellow Japanese corn pur√©e that provided colour and a pleasant sweetness. The ginger-shoyu vinaigrette mixed in with the greens also added a slight acidity and complemented the savoury tuna.
Black Miso Tuna, beautifully seared, served with Japanese corn pur√©e, French bean nicoise, pea shoots, basil flowers and ginger-shoyu vinaigrette by Chef Enoch of @garcons.sg is one of the 3 dishes available from the collaboration between Timbre+ chefs and @ediblegardencity for #FestivalForGood, happening tomorrow!

Come on down and be #partofthegood, learn more about growing your own food through the workshops! -\n<br />By Chef Jeremy of Dusk, this Lime leaf chicken was sous-vide perfectly, keeping it juicy and moist atop a bed of savoury mixed grains of brown rice, barley and split beans; cauliflower pur√©e, light Asian slaw with pomegranate, sesame chilli dressed with Mizuna, a rocket-like greens, and amaranth.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you #Burpple for the kind invite and @raiSEsg for hosting us!
It is indeed an interesting concept especially when many peple do not have the luxury to discover farms and agriculture in Singapore. This is also a sustainable way for us to be self-sufficient in getting our greens supply. Recently, they incorporated a new element in their program which is to include those who are mentally ill to cultivate in their garden. It is believed that this activity serves as an alternative \"therapy\" for them.\n<br />.\n<br />In conjunction with FESTIVAL FOR GOOD, Edible Garden City will collaborate with three chefs from Timbre+ to curate three special dishes showcasing carefully cultivated produce from local farms. Above was the Grilled Ribeye Beef with Ulam Rajah, Spinach, Tomatoes and Soy Ginger Vinaigrette prepared by @kushgrillsg. With a few edible flowers, the dish was visually engaging and the simplicity of the dish brought a good surprise to the tastebuds. Following the advice form Chef Deming, I savoured the tender grilled ribeye beef with each different element altogether. It was light to the palate and it burst out in different flavours ‚Äî savoury, tangy and sweet with a little bit of kick.\n<br />.\n<br />Another dish prepared will be Black Miso Tuna, Japanese Corn Pur√©e, French Bean Ni√ßoise, Pea Shoots, Basil Flower and Ginger-Shoyu Vinaigrette from @garcons.sg and Lime Leaf Chicken, Savoury Mixed Grains, Caulifower Pure√©, Asian Slaw, Sesame Chilli Dressed Mizuna and Amaranth from Dusk. In addition to their collaboration with Edible Garden City during this festival, Gar√ßons also carries a social mission of employing ex-ofenders and offerring training for those from boys home, giving them another chance to be integrated back into the society.\n<br />.\n<br />All the dishes would only be available during the event (20 August 2016) at Timbre+ and since the local produces are \"planted upon order\", those who are interested are encouraged to make a pre-order at https://ediblegardencityxtimbre.peatix.com and enjoy $2 off for each dish. Moreover, in the month of August, enjoy 10% off all main courses at Gar√ßons at the Pinnacle! Be #partofthegood :)
Juicy pork belly stuffed with all sorts of goodness (garlic, lemongrass, spring onions, chillies), slowly roasted over coals till the flavours infuse deep within the succulent meat and skin turns into a golden brown hue of glorious crackling. I could get high on this crack. \n<br />One of the few stalls making the trip to Timbre+ worthwhile. \n<br />#FTrecommends
Featuring special creations that incorporate carefully cultivated produce from our local farms, #FestivalForGood will see a collaboration between social enterprise @Ediblegardencity and three Timbre+ chefs.

The upcoming #FestivalForGood on 20th August will see a collaboration between social enterprise @ediblegardencity and 3 Timbre+ chefs to create 3 exclusive dishes, featuring carefully cultivated produce from local farms!\n<br />-\n<br />Not one to eat my greens voluntarily but I enjoyed this colourful plate of juicy chargrilled ribeye lightly seasoned to bring out its natural goodness, served with ulam rajah, spinach mustard greens, tomatoes, drizzled with amazingly refreshing soy ginger vinaigrette, created by Chef Deming of Kush. The fresh, crunchy greens were carefully selected for a variation in textures, and I particularly liked the use of mustard greens that tasted vaguely like wasabi. Simple as it is, this dish was the perfect marriage of textures and flavours. A limited number of plates will be available so do pre-order at ediblegardencityxtimbre.peatix.com and enjoy $2 off each dish. @ediblegardencity will also be conducting a learning journey on how to grow your own food organically, soil fertility, watering and pest management!\n<br />-\n<br />The first of its kind to celebrate social enterprises, with hopefully more to come, this festival\'s gonna be fun - come down and be #partofthegood, for food, performances, interesting workshops to learn from these inspiring social enterprises.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you #Burpple for the invite, and @raiSEsg for hosting us, and glad to learn more about this meaningful event.

Singapore\'s inaugural #FestivalForGood on 20 August organised by the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprises (raiSE) aims to raise awareness of F&amp;B social enterprises. For this special occasion, three Timbre+ chefs and Edible Garden City will create three exclusive dishes for the festival using locally cultivated produce!
With a troubled past, the founder of Soon Huat Bak Teh, Mr Jabez gives new hope to reformed ex-offenders who seeks to have a second chance in life. Having worked his way up in the prison kitchen and even cooking for condemned prisoners, the¬†ex-inmate turned entrepreneur broke away from his previous destructive lifestyle to start anew. Truly inspiring!
If there\'s one skewer you need to get at Teppei Daidokoro in Timbre+, go straight for the Salmon Belly! I enjoyed the lightly crisped skin atop the slightly fatty and tender salmon. Each skewer is grilled after dipping in the house made yakitori sauce. Give me 5 sticks I\'ll still be able to finish it on my own, lip smacking good!
An absolute stunner, a fiery contender of a dish that truly exemplifies a collaboration that could potentially change the whole landscape. Sadly, this was only available for a couple of days during Timbre+\'s Open Stoves event (23-24 July). For people who didn\'t get a chance to sample this, we pray and hope that they will make this a permanent thing in future.\n<br />.\n<br />Presenting to you the Cebu Bellychon Curry Noodles with Salted Vegetables &amp; Lime ($10) by Iskina Cebu\'s Chef Christian Calledo (@iskinacebusingapore) and Artichoke\'s Chef Bjorn Shen (@artichoke_sg @bjornshen).\n<br />.\n<br />Timbre+\n<br />Address: 73A, Ayer Rajah Crescent, JTC Launchpad at one-north, Singapore 139957 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #hawkerhopping #singaporefoodfestival #sff2016 #hawkerspotlight #timbre #timbreplus #openstoves #iskinacebu #birdbirdsg
The Fishball Story with their signature handmade fishballs. This was the Set C with chilli fish cakes, QQ fishballs, fried fish skins and fried beancurd skins! Everything on point and it speaks volumes of Singapore Hawker Fare üëçüèª                                 6bucks/bowl                                                    #FTrecommends
Cancelled brunch plans at a fancy joint to get my hands on this bowl of Pork Bellychon Curry Noodles. ZERO REGRETS.\n<br />A culinary mash-up by @birdbirdsg and @iskinacebusingapore for #OpenStoves, this satisfied me at the most primal level.\n<br />The MSG-free pork bellychon was obscenely good with a thin, firmly crispy skin plus glistening, moist and tender meat. It packed an incredible depth of flavour that\'s all natural, thanks to the abundance of garlic, lemongrass, chopped chillies and the chef\'s \"secret recipe\".\n<br />The Northern Thai-style curry beehoon more than held its own with the fine strands of rice noodles saturated in the light, slightly tangy curry gravy. Topped with \"kiam chye\", purple onions and Chinese parsley, this was exactly the kind of complementary carb to best tango with those chunky cuts of rich pork.
Chatterbox is well known for their pricey chicken rice and have launched a food truck for their 45th anniversary. But the truck will only be around from 15th‚Äì31st July. We managed to visit the truck at Timbre+ during the Open Stoves event last weekend and tried this delicious Chicken Rice Maki. Well worth the $8 for the fragrant flavour in each bite! I want to have this again! The next stop for the truck is 30th July at Car Free Sunday (along Connaught Drive next to Singapore Cricket Club, 7:30am‚Äì12:00pm). Please come back to Timbre+! üòÖ 
The best belly filling dish was the Bellychon Curry Noodles ($10)! A collaboration between Chef Chris Calledo of @iskinacebusingapore &amp; Chef Bjorn Shen of @artichoke_sg / @birdbirdsg! \n<br />That lechon was so good, I just sat there &amp; savoured it to the last bit while slurping up the thin vermicelli soaked with curry. Add in some lime juice &amp; you\'ve got the zesty kick that you need!
Nicely grilled with butter and garlic. So simple and perfect. Much better than lobster rolls suffocated with sauce. Awesome stuff!\n<br />#DancingCrabSG #TimbrePlus #OpenStoves #SingaporeFoodFestival
Gotta try out the hyped up items like this right? This was ok but nothing to shout about. Best eaten fresh and warm. From Chatter Box\'s food truck at Timbre+ Open Stoves event this weekend (23 &amp; 24 July \'16). If you\'re getting anything here, order the Chicken Rice Maki!\n<br />#TimbrePlus #OpenStoves #ChatterBox 
This has got to be the most creative and most delicious dish for Open Stoves at Timbre+! (According to this durian lover)\n<br />Sticky rice with fried shallots and D24 ice cream topped with candied basil. Smooth Durian ice cream that\'s not overwhelming, but is super creamy and goes really well with the sticky rice. Surprisingly the fried shallots didn\'t taste out of place at all. A must try from Tuk Tuk Viethai Cuisine if you\'re headed to Open Stoves (23 &amp; 24 July \'16).\n<br />#SingaporeFoodFestival #Durian #TimbrePlus #OpenStoves #TukTukVietaiCuisine
Tomorrow\'s the last day, so if you have some spare time, do drop by Timbre+ for this final chance to try out these dishes, while stocks last starting 12pm. Out of the five, my top favourites are:
A collaboration between Timbre+ tenant TUK-TUK Viethai (one of the newest tenants at Timbre+) and The Disgruntled Chef. The durian ice-cream is what dreams are made of ‚Äî so pungent, so rich it\'s like you are eating the real deal, just colder, smoother and no fibres. Glutinous Rice is pretty much what you would expect from a Thai Mango Sticky Rice dessert; subtly sweet but with Ikan Bilis for a little savoury crunch. The sugared basil leaf helps add a little sweetness and gives it a herby flavour while balancing out both elements. This is the only dessert available at the Open Stoves event at Timbre+ (usual desserts are still available at the various stalls in Timbre+) which I feel is something you should not miss if you are in need for a dessert to end off the meal perfectly.
A collaboration between Timbre+ tenant Gar√ßons and Keng Eng Kee Seafood ‚Äî also one that I was really looking forward to as well on my end. The Pork Rib is prepared using modern cooking techniques, confit and comes fused with Keng Eng Kee\'s signature coffee glaze used in their Coffee Ribs. The Pork Ribs are not as soft as expected, but it\'s still pretty tender given how the flesh comes off from the bones so effortlessly which was pretty well-executed. Coated in Keng Eng Kee\'s signature coffee glaze, I liked the smoky, sweet yet caffeinated flavours of the glaze which goes into the meat pretty well, and the smart addition of the almond crumbles not just adds a little crunch to the ribs but gives it a flavour very much that seemed to have been inspired by eating Lotus Caramalized Cookies dipped into coffee. Achar is surprisingly fresh, juicy and chunky with the sour-ish zing able to cut through the heavy flavours of the ribs, and a plus point because it doesn\'t carry an onslaught of peanuts as well. It\'s definitely something I find not to be missed at the Open Stoves event.
An absolute stunner, a fiery contender of a dish that truly exemplifies a collaboration that could potentially change the whole landscape. Sadly, this was only available for a couple of days during Timbre+\'s Open Stoves event (23-24 July). For people who didn\'t get a chance to sample this, we pray and hope that they will make this a permanent thing in future.
A collaboration between Timbre+ tenant Teppei Daidokoro and Cocotte. Here, the Negitoro transforms into a cooked Barramundi with evident fusion of Indian flavours, yet matched with the familiar Japanese touches such as the Ikura roe and Japanese rice. The flavours of Indian spices are commendable here ‚Äî very strong and flavourful as it coats the flaky barramundi which did not lose its moisture, drenched in an aioli that\'s refreshing with a little lime zest that compliments and lifts the flavour of the spices coated on the top so it doesn\'t get too heavy.
One of the more popular stalls here but I find it pretty meh. üêë\n<br />#howtonotbefat #timbre #burrple
Grated wasabi, heaps of Ikura and sashimi. Nothing much to say really, except that Teppei never disappoints.
Generous chunks of lightly marinated salmon, tuna, swordfish, scallop and salmon roe over Japanese rice. You know you want this.
So excited for the Iskina Cebu x Artichoke/Bird Bird pairing for the Open Stoves event! At $10, it\'s really more of curry vermicelli, but damn right it was flavorful and look at that crackling. Luv it!! Also tried The Fishball Story but the meepok pales in comparison to this. 
Lunch time! Waltzed around timbre+ before deciding on this stall with the shortest queue - cuz well, awkward to keep colleagues waiting. So hey, another chance to try another item, and boy was I rewarded! 
Featuring a spread of affordable mod-Sin fare here at timbre+, Kush ‚Äì a short for Kushiyaki ‚Äì specialises in charcoal-grilled skewers as well as pairing our humble Southeast Asian spices and ingredients with international classics. My picks include the Salted Egg Fries (loved the curry leaf-infused, strong salted egg flavours in the dipping sauce) and Soft Shell Chilli Crab rice bowl that comes with an onsen egg and sambal kangkong.
Filipino food. Non crispy pork belly. Too much meat for my liking.
Well, I didn\'t know what to eat at Timbre+.\n<br />Long queue at Teppei, so decided to try it out.\n<br />Average. Just like any other Tori Q kiosk.
Tried the Salted Egg Prawn with black soba, Duck Confit Potato and Smoked Salmon. I would say, try it for novelty\'s sake; don\'t expect too much from them tastewise.
The lunch-time regulars at timbre+ will be sure to know this stall. Though I often get the soup version of ban mian, I will order the dry version at this stall. Super love the egg mixed in with the noodles, crispy anchovies, and amazing dark sauce/oil! Cheat code: I always ask for the dark red chilli, and the uncle is always more than happy to share his great creation - yumz!
Pretty substantial portion for $6. The fishballs and fish cake have really good texture too! It also doesn\'t help that I\'m a sucker for deep fried fish skin :) don\'t forget to return your tray to get a dollar back! (8/10)
Fresh pieces of fish with huge chunks of salmon! I found the seasoning too salty though and didn\'t like the wasabi which had a plastic taste. Still, overall a satisfying meal at only $16! 
It\'s really a lot for $16. &amp; you can return the tray to get back $1. Very filling. 
So when my wife and I decided to brace ourselves to Timbre+ despite the possibility of being crowded out on a Saturday night, I had to choose something I\'m confident of pleasing my wife.\n<br />.\n<br />It\'s still fork tender, with fats and lean meat of the right proportion so it isn\'t overly tough nor overly greasy. Skin is still crispy, but aren\'t crackling like the ones I had at Garcons@Essen. The honey balsamic reduction is the saviour here, cos if the meat wasn\'t roasted well enough, the sauce could help mask some of the imperfection. And it does it well because the balsamic helps make the meat less gelat, while the honey made sure the vinegar doesn\'t overdo it.\n<br />.\n<br />I was satisfied with it, despite having tasted the one at Essen so I knew that it hadn\'t reach its full potential.
Amazing fish paste pre-otah. It tastes super good. But a bit expensive at $20
Back for more kaisendon from Teppei!
Couldn\'t resist this.. Look at those juicy salmon roe! Yums..and those yummy pieces of salmon and tuna.. This is really something to die for.
somehow it lacked the sweet, tender juiciness of the fish I associate with the Tanjong Pagar outlets. less sauce though, so not so salty haha. but still quite nice la üòõ‚úåüèºÔ∏è #food #foodiepics #burpple
My favourite sip during last night‚Äôs Beerfest Asia 2016 preview. Comes in a pretty colour for the ladies and it suits my taste for lighter flavoured beers as it‚Äôs a mix of light ABK beer and organic lemonade.\n<br />The eighth edition of Beerfest Asia is coming up really soon, from 16‚Äî19 June and will be held at Marina Promenade. Expect to see a showcase of 500 different kinds of beers and ciders at the event whilst enjoying entertainment from a range of tribute bands. Gather your friends and grab your tickets from SISTIC today.\n<br />Thanks to @veronicaphua for extending the invitation to this preview. =)\n<br />#BeerfestAsia2016 #BeerfestAsia
No wonder people were saying how stuffy it is (despite the wind blasting from every corner and smacking my face continuously hahaha). Really liked the \"hippy\" atmosphere, too bad didn\'t stay Long enough to enjoy the band ‚òπÔ∏è\n<br />Though I\'m on team \"Bak Chor Mee\" but Fishball Story is really another story üòÇ Fish skin was crunchy, fishball that goes boing boing, &amp; right proportion of Chili and pork lard for the noodles. üòç
Got to see what\'s brewing for this year\'s upcoming #BeerfestAsia last night!
Nayyy #TwoWings nia at $8.90 with a plain rice drizzled with Bbq/teriyaki sauce ‚Ä¢ -\n<br />-\n<br />Salted Egg version didn\'t flare as good as the original wings. Crispness, yes, but if I were given a choice, I rather buy real salted eggs to eat or a box of salt with my $8.90 üòí ‚Ä¢ -\n<br />-\n<br />Another thingy, WHY the wings so much smaller &amp; skinny huh??! Only looked big in my pix!!
Featuring a spread of high quality, reasonably-priced Japanese food, Teppei Daidokoro is the latest casual takeaway offering from Chef Teppei Yamashita in Singapore. Yakitori lovers would dig the Fukuoka-inspired skewered dishes coated with Chef Teppei\'s signature tare. My picks include the chicken meatball, salmon belly, signature Kaisen Don, and Pork Katsu Curry.

Having #TheFishballStory for breakfast is simply a wonderful idea!! Especially when you are eating in an environment that\'s so funky and yo-yo-yo!! It\'s worth travelling from Serangoon to one-north (#timbreplus) to have this simple and yet delicious fare. üëçüèªüëçüèª Seems like they do have some brisk \"fishy\" business! üçúüçú‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏èüç¥üç¥
You get to taste intense charcoal flavour-infused yakitori sticks, which he spent many months formulating and perfecting his signature yakitori sauce to deliver those smoky and earthly notes of charcoal and unami for yakitori lovers.
.
Wong kee\'s beef brisket spinach noodles ($5.50) -- The tender beef brisket complemented the spinach noodles soooo well!
Didn\'t look very fantastic when the young lady was preparing it, but it taste really good! The beef brisket sauce is really good. And the wanton from this stall is quite value for money too. Worth a try! 
My next few posts will continue to focus on local food in support of the #uncagestreetfood campaign. This is the tomato wanton noodles from Wong Kee. There are many things I like about this.\n<br />.\n<br />Noodles - it is al dente, and is subtle in its tomato flavor. You would miss the tomato flavour if you aren\'t paying attention, but if you quieten your senses, you would be rewarded with that subtle taste, and I like it this way. And with such springy noodles, there\'s nothing else I ask for. I do prefer eggy noodles such as those at Eng\'s (Tanjong Katong), but that\'s a different type of noodles altogether.\n<br />.\n<br />Shrimp dumpling - plump with smooth skin and wholesome fillings that includes prawns that\'s bouncy. There\'s some crunchy bits in the dumplings that adds a little umami to it, i think it\'s dried flat fish.\n<br />.\n<br />Char siew - Not the best but you can\'t pit a noodle stall against those char siew specialists. It is still fibrous with my desire smoky burnt ends so it\'s not bad.
So after hearing a few good reviews from colleagues about this slider and hearing @sir.fried.chicken give it a thumbs up, we couldn\'t resist ordering one even after stuffing our faces full of food for a few hours.\n<br />Definitely a good choice, the outter pastry is soft and flaky while the beef rendang filling is delicious.\n<br />Thanks Chef Damian D‚ÄôSilva for letting us take this photo. üòÅ\n<br />#DsJoint #TimbrePlus #OneNorth
Gosnells\' probably the sweetest bottle of booze that I\'ve had, without tasting too artificial. The natural sweetness of honey lingers after every mouthful, making it almost irresistible. It\'s an alcoholic sweet treat to end every meal with.
Went late and mostly only the restaurants were opened! Enjoyed the salted egg yolk wings with a side of sweet potato fries ($9.90)
2 munchies: These mouthwatering-looking wings may have intrigued us when the plate landed on the table, but the salted egg was barely existent upon tasting the overly greasy, deep-fried chicken. There was also no trace of curry leaf fragrance. Do not waste your calories on this, please.\n<br />Go for the original signature wings that were crispier and better marinated!
Aside from the Kaisendon, I also liked the Katsu Curry rice, for its juicy yet crispy Katsu cutlet drizzled over by a comforting curry base. Their portions are generous but if you are in the mood for a treat, do add on their takoyaki dishes at a small charge. \n<br />Thanks @geekyelephant for the invite!!!
Tried and tested, the Kaisen Don under the Teppei brand, can always be counted on to satisfy most people\'s craving for raw fish in a rice bowl. Hefty chunks of assorted sashimi are tossed in a light and savoury house dressing before being piled atop a mound of Japanese rice - making this a genuinely \"oishiii\" meal. \n<br />With a Teppei Daikodoro outlet located within Timbre+, those of you who work around the area, or are visiting this hipsterised hawker centre, can grab one just as easily now. Just look out for their bright orange neon-lit sign.
Designed as a casual takeaway kiosk, we get to taste intense charcoal flavour-infused yakitori sticks includes chicken meatball, chicken with Japanese leek, pork belly, pork sausages, salmon belly and quail eggs. My heart still goes to this beautiful bowl of Kaisen Don that is overflowing with cubes of sashimi and ikura, marinated in their specialty house sauce that brings out the sweetness of the seafood, yet not overly salty. Pretty satisfying!
As with most Teppei branded food outlets, I find these to be really value for money.
Generic tasting skewers aside, the Hokkaido croquette stood out for having a filling akin to uncooked roux, and whilst the katsu cutlet was pleasant enough, not much else can be said about it.
Back in the day when you ordered \"wings\" from Two Wings they were all decent sized wing joints stacked in a neat row. Not sure why the \"wings\" at this outlet consists of 3 small wings and 3 small drumlets? üòï\n<br />#TwoWingsSG #TimbrePlus *
their chicken tasted like a cross between salted egg &amp; har cheong kai.. yummy nonetheless!
Can\'t wait to have more soon.\n<br />#TeppeiDaidokoro #TimbrePlus #OneNorth *
This Kaisendon rice bowl with various cuts of shashimi was one of the delicious items we got to try. Thanks @myrontay for the invitation and @teppeidaidokoro for feeding us. =) Will definitely be back to grab more food during work days. One of the benefits of working right next to Timbre+. #TeppeiDaidokoro #TimbrePlus #OneNorth
Kinda like the decorations. Hippy also come with price tag. Many salted egg theme food spotted. These stalted egg bread alike thing tasted so gooddd.. forget the name alrdy.  Food range mostly $7-15.. got dancing crab too price can reach 100+ depends on the choice. They also have this interesting concept of need to return own tray to get back addtional $1 you paid at shop. Air ventilation could have been better.. #timbresg #igsg #burpple
I\'ve always been a big fan of slake, for serving value for money and quality meat platters, hence I decided to give this place a shot! The menu is slightly but similarly it was packed with value! I ordered the poached chicken with pesto (250g, this was the smallest portion mind you) [$6] and I made it a meal [additional $5] which comes with gazpacho, soft cooked egg, dressed salad and a choice of side. Amongst the sides options, you can opt for pasta salad, sweet potato mash &amp; olive rice! I was recommended by the staff to try the olive rice, which turned out flavorful and somewhat reminded me of chicken rice rice perhaps due to the spices used. Chicken was poached beautifully, absolutely stunning with the homemade pesto. (Sold separately too) For $11, I\'d say the portions are really generous! Definitely worth coming back for other meats!
Lobster Rolls from Dancing Crabs! Chunks of lobster mear and slaw sandwiched between buttery toasted bread, with a side of fries. Going at $24. Could have been more generous with the lobster and fries. But nevertheless, tasted pretty decent!
Sticky Date Pudding from Dusk. The pudding itself was a tad dry but all was not lost with the creamy dense burnt caramel ice cream. The ice cream was so so good. This cost about $9 
Timbre+ has a lively atmosphere, a stage in the middle which plays live music at certain timings and hot pop music other times. With the current salted egg yolk craze, how can anybody miss this Salted Egg Yolk Wings ($8.90). Salted egg yolk taste was pretty mild but the crispiness exterior and juicy meat of each wings made it a tasty dish in overall. üòã
Fresh chunks of salmon, tuna, swordfish, scallop and salmon roe over Japanese rice. Love it especially when the salmon roe burst in my mouth üòã. Definitely one of the better options in Timbre+.üëçüèª
True enough the noodles were delicious - both the spinach and tomato noodles had an interesting taste. The beef was very tender and I like that the char siew was thickly cut for a substantial bite. And best of all is the dumpling! Big and fat and full of liao inside - so satisfying! üëç
Have to give Fat Samurai ($9) by The World is Flat a go! This attracted many passerby attention when we left it on the table üòç. Duck confit, bacon, prawn, burnt onions, smashed US beef, roasted cabbage, Konbu mayo, balsamic Okonomiyaki sauce, crispy bacon flakes, mozzarella and brie on charcoal crust. Each bite is a burst of different flavour combined. A hell of a pizza and we highly recommend it! üòãüëçüèª
Tuna, salmon, ikura, scallops etc.... Will try the yakitori next time and bring the wife coz she loves this, but will leave the kid at home. Too warm for babies.
This awesome mess is made out of umami charcoal crust, overloaded with bacon, prawns, duck confit, burnt confit onions, roasted cabbage, beef, balsamic-okonomiyaki sauce, konbu mayo and crispy bonito flakes all held together by umami mozzarella and smoked brie. Whatttttttt.... this is really one awesome gooey goodness. Just $9 for a slice! From The World is flat
This plate is the whole animal farm rolled into one. Succulent and tender beef, chicken, pork and salmon confit. Balanced with the crispy fried tofu.
Not rave about Two Wings. Okay I won\'t. Definitely a standard below their original wings that I\'ve tried at pinnacle and bukit Merah. At least they were still crisp on the outside! Yay! \n<br />On a side note.. Saw a bunch of photographers with Nikons üò± can\'t wait to see all their peektures  too! \n<br />Dragging out my rebel on an office work day... Took me an hour to contemplate üòÇ but thank goodness the company was way better! Thanks @childlife88 üòç and other yelp elites :)
Fat Samurai $9 \n<br />Duck confit, bacon, prawn, burnt onion, smashed US Beef, roasted cabbage, Konbu mayo, okonomiyaki sauce, crispy bonito flakes, mozzarella and Brie, umami charcoal crust.
These wings are only freshly fried upon order. Moving together with the current trend, owner Jeremy has introduced Salted Egg Chicken Wings.
‚ò∫Ô∏è Best dish of the night no doubt goes to #Portico\'s Truffle Fries. Must try would be #TheWorldIsFlat\'s Fat Samurai pizza (bacon, beef, duck, bonito flakes and all types of goodness you can think of on a charcoal crust). The rest you could probably just skip! Love the entire vibes and ambience of this place. Remember to return your trays - you get $1 for every tray returned üòÅ #eatoutsg #burpple #8dayseat
Rock melon\n<br />2. Patatas bravas\n<br />3. Squid with lime and coriander.
Patatas bravas are fried potatoes served with sauces. This version at Portico uses black garlic mayo, so that gave it an Asian touch to this Spanish tapas.
Quality has been constantly satisfactory. In fact, the marination tastes less salty than before and I really love their rice. It\'s the safest lunch option at timbre+ because it just never fails. On a side note, they serve pretty great yakitoris too! My favourite would be their chicken &amp; leeks and salmon belly skewers. 
They sell food layered in blocks like these ones -- from left to right: Soba layers with dipping sauce made into jelly, lasagna made with coloured Ban Mian slices and filling in between, triple mashed potato stack with torched bacon on top. I promise you\'ll love how it feeds both your eyes and tummy. \n<br />Timbre+ at One North is the freshly opened new-age food centre you just HAVE to check out üëÄ
This is my second visit to Timbre+ (third if you consider my that unfortunate Sunday when i went and all stalls are closed). This is their compression of rock melon with jamon serrano and herb pesto dressing. If you like the Italian rock melon with parma ham, you should like this! Not everyone can appreciate the herb pesto dressing though, but it\'s only $10 so feel free to give it a try and decide if it\'s for you.

Just a short walk from one-north MRT lies this massive food hall opened by the folks behind Timbre. The open-air structure is formed by vibrantly painted shipping containers, and houses 35 food concepts. At lunch, new-gen hawker stalls Fishball Story and Wong Kee Wanton Mee are well worth the queue (note: all 21 hawker stalls open only till 6pm). Live music plays from Wednesday to Saturday nights, making this an excellent spot for a cold beer after work. Pair your pint with Kush\'s Curry Chicken Rice Bowl ($10.80, ask for more gravy), yakitori from Teppei Daidokoro, or Iskina Cebu\'s irresistible Spicy BellyChon ($20/500g)! Pro tip: find a seat near the edges of the hall, it gets warm.
Come hang out with the cool startup kids in the area. üòù\n<br />#TimbrePlus #OneNorth
They\'re just opened, getting around their new kitchen and gathering feedback about the paella, quite generous of them.
Food Truck Concepts\n<br />Some of the names you can expect include Portico Platos (Spanish Tapas), The World Is Flat by Tanuki Raw (revamped pizzas), Dancing Crab Shack (lobster rolls and shrimp po‚Äôboy sandwiches), Chit Chaat Chai (North Indian Street food), Big Bern‚Äôs American Grill(American food by Botak Jones), Kush (mod-sin skewers and rice bowls by The Quarters), Teppei Daidokoro (Japanese rice bowls), Iskina Cebu (food from Philippines), Dusk by Slake (Peranakan-inspired food), Gar√ßons(Modern French food), Soon Huat (Bak Kut Teh), Two Wings (fried chicken) and Food Anatomy (layered food such as lasagna). More here \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/03/27/timbreplus/
Rarely eat fishball noodles but ever since fishball story opened in University Town, I\'ve been wanting to try their fishballs.
You have to first pay $1 upfront at the stall for usage of a tray. When you\'re done, you\'re supposed to insert your tray through this rectangular hole here, where there is a conveyor belt that takes in your tray. A $1 coin will then fall through the silver pocket above. All automated.
From familiar names like Fishball Story, Two Wings and Gar√ßons to new concepts such as Portico Platos (Spanish tapas) and Kush (skewers and rice bowls), this place is a certainly a sexy (and sweaty - we\'re talking Zoukout levels of moist during lunch hour) addition to the brainy, entrepreneurial-spirited neighbourhood of Ayer Rajah.
With the array of food selections available, you\'ll definitely need to wash it down &amp; what can be better than to do it w some ice cold beer? üçª They offer a wide selection of both bottled &amp; taps. If you enjoy your booze hoppy, go for this IPA by Stone. Packs a punch of fruity, floral notes, hops &amp; a grapefruit bitterness at the end. üçªüé∂ 
Juicy &amp; savory lechon! Highly popular. Make this your first purchase here as the queue would probably take you 45mins to an hour! :) 
From Kush, this bowl was the bomb. If you order the skewers and the skewer bowls here, you\'ll be disappointed. You should get this chicken curry bowl instead. It came with an onsen egg and sambal Kang Kong on Japanese rice, and was tasty tasty tasty. Ask for more gravy, you won\'t be able to stop. The curry is quite lemak, and the chicken is nicely smoky from the char grill. Unlike any other chicken curry I\'ve had, certainly not Japanese or Chinese-esque. Will order again! 
From the folks behind Gayatri, the trusty restaurant with a few outlets around the island, Chit Chaat Chai\'s chicken biryani was darn delicious. Don\'t mind the plastic serve ware, it\'s refined flavours and beautifully cooked chicken leg transported me to a place much unlike the hip, trendy surrounding of the brand new timbre+. Be sure to eat with the raita and gravy with every mouthful. SO delicious. Will come here again and wash it down with a pint of ice cold beer after work üí™üèª
Probably the first skewers off the shelf. Loved how the leek went with the chicken. Finish this with a glass of beer from Timbre! 
Having tried their roasts (which is actually pretty good) before with rice, this time round I have opted for the noodles instead. The noodles were really springy and had a bite, swimming in a savoury sauce though the chili was not really at all spicy. Portions are generous, and definitely satisfies without being at all shabby. An enticing option for the office workers here!
Not the best. But good enough for one-north\'s standard. (Rating:üôÇ)
Another near and cheap option for the crowd at Ayer Rajah Crescent. Rice isn\'t quite as generous as what would you expect for a $3.60 price tag, but the dishes though nothing much to shout about were by far decent for the office workers around.
Convenient eats downstairs - generous portion, not so flavourful rice. Never had so much chili in a meal üòï Every scoop of rice with a spoon of chili.
From Nam Heng Hainam Chicken Rice stall at the temporary food centre. The rice was a tad bland for a one that comes from a chicken rice stall, and that the gravy could probably do with more flavour. Roast Pork is savoury, has a bite and has a crisp skin, while charsiew is chunky, savoury and sweet. Portion is good for $3 a plate, and the chili definitely packs enough punch to compensate for the lackluster rice and gravy.
The menu.
$5 for a generous serving of meat! Definitely for meat lovers.
Finally got my cravings satisfied! Dry banmien + fried dumplings = best combi ever!! üòçüòçüòç
Feels good after. #mustsharethatyouarehealthytotheworld
Once more, feeding my gluttony self some more kickass bomb Prata. I love how they look all red like they are gonna explode any moment. 
My absolute favourite Prata of all time. I will only eat this! Bomb Prata is filled with sugar and honey. Fattening but satisfying! 
Incredible dish for a rainy day.
It\'s chicken and egg problem. I\'ll eat both.
Once again burpple lunch at doremon stall. The vege is super awesome along with the fluffy eggs.
Burpple team lunch! Super cheap total cost for five of us is 17 plus
The uncle at the Doraemon stall whipped all of these for us in five minutes. Feels especially homecooked - left all of us with satisfied, warm bellies.
At the doremon stall, the uncle takes ingredient out from up, down, left, right of the wok
Trying out the new stall downstairs. Not too bad with a friendly service. 
Wanna guess which fruit flavors we ordered today? We were feeling a little adventurous.. Haha it\'s too bad it tasted really odd
Already been a few weeks, but this new addition to the food centre is a welcome change.

The huge bowl but decent portion of bee hoon has 2 unshelled prawns, 3 clams, 3 small pieces of squid, egg and some vegetables. It tasted not bad as the broth is rather light and tasty.

I ordered a bowl of their Pork Noodles ($4) to try. For a mere four dollars, I have a generous bowl of noodles that comes with many ingredients such as lean pork slices, pork offal, meatball and fishcake. The soup was really sweet and hearty, which goes well with the kway teow. It will be better if the texture of the rice noodle can be thinner and softer.

yes, it has everything you need, from crispy crackling, succulent belly chunks and noodles dredged in aromatic curry sauce spiked with a bit of lime
The dessert is made up of glutinous rice + crispy puffed wild rice, topped with D24 ice cream and candied basil leaf.
The slabs are then transferred from brine to duck fat and cooked low and slow at 90¬∞C for 6 hours before being seared in a 230¬∞C oven for good caramelisation at the end. Good ole\' coffee ribs with a touch of finesse from excellent French technique. The final dusting of butter crackers  cranking up the nostalgic factor
It is durian ice cream on sticky rice. It may look simple and small in serving but the flavour gives feeling of satisfaction with its rich durian ice cream, tastes almost the real fruit only that it\'s cold and creamy. The sticky rice has enough sweetness which didn\'t steal the attention from the durian ice cream, instead they complemented each other. A perfect dessert after eating curry. üòú\n<br />#openstoves #burpple #yeyfood #timbreplus #tuktukviethai

Wong Kee Tomato Wanton Noodles did not disappoint with its springy noodles and special wantons that tasted more than just pork - it had the qq taste of fishballs and a pleasant surprise! However, the self-proclaimed original salted egg fries were a huge disappointment, fries were no different from that of McDonalds\' with a side of salted egg sauce yet cost us $8.50. \n<br />#Burpple #tslmakan #whati8today #sgfood #exploresingapore #wantonmee #wongkee #timbreplus #saltedegg #fries #sgfoodie #igsg #8dayseat #SGMakanDiary#roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition #BurppleCheapNGood

Not as good as it looks
Avocado ($2.50) // Strawberry Mango ($2.30). Super creamy &amp; refreshing respectively. Aaaahhh give me some more!
Pretty amazing Singapore-mexican fusion. Yummy.
Not as good as it looks. But interesting Japanese pizza.
The char siew was rather flavourful but the winners were the fried and steamed wantons, that were both filling and extremely tasty to have!
It was good, but not the best definitely! ..hope to recover ASAP before Saturday\'s Savour event! üòáüòá
The so called stacked food comes in a variety of combination. Each meal is $16 which comes with a choice of 3 different stacked food. We tried the Cold Soba, Organic Lasagna and Pork Cheek with Fragrant Rice. The cold soba is our favourite with the creative de-constructed cold soba idea. Pretty in presentation but I think the stall overlook the fact that it is very hard to handle and eat the dishes.

Excellent value and novelty. The spinach infusion actually worked well to give the noodles it\'s signature greenish hue. The wontons and Shui Jiaos are plump and meaty.

The organic lemonade-mixed ABK Rose from the legendary multiple award-winning Aktien Brewery, a 700-year-old Bavarian company, proved to be quite a hit with most of us ladies (and a few gentlemen). Gosnells, a modernised mead made in Peckham, London, was possibly the most heavenly thing I had tonight. Seriously besotted with its bubbly, oh-so-refreshing, light honey flavour. On the right is the golden beauty from Japan - the Swanlake Koshihikari Rice Lager. Made with the same premium rice that\'s used for sushi, it\'s quite mild but has the distinct taste of its main ingredient. \n<br />You can taste or drink your fill of these three plus about five hundred more commercialised and craft beers, ciders and other spirits at the upcoming BeerFest Asia 2016 happening this June at the Marina Promenade.

Pretty satisfying!
Tried the normal wings the other day when I came with @zh_kwok @dallannnnn @xuezhetan  but it wasn\'t that great IMO. This however, earns a YUMs on my list. It\'s thick and strong, though it can be overwhelming in large quantities so I will suggest to go for 2 piece per pax if you haven\'t tried it before. Eatertainer Factor: 8.5/10
One of it is famous for their Fried chicken wings, two wings. \n<br />The salted egg yolk taste is mild as though it was not marinated enough. I still prefer their original fried chicken wings, where is both crispy and juicy ! \n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #saltedegg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic
Crispy nachos with tender pork rendang!! The flavours were damn on point too!! Thanks for the recommendation @eatabowloftea This is absolutely spot on!
At Two Wings, the wings are deep fried for nine minutes which will give them that moist and juiciness inside while crispy on the outside. Worth mentioning is the special homemade chilli sauce that is pretty potent. If you can\'t take spicy stuff, I advice you to skip it as it probably will numb your taste buds deterring you to enjoy the delicious wings. In conjunction with the opening of their third outlets at Timbre+, Two Wings launches its new flavour - Salted Egg Yolk Chicken Wings.
Understand it is only available during Chinese New Year only. I was lucky when they sell it during their opening promotion.

One of their signature item at @wongkeewantonnoodle , the noodles with a hint of tomato sweetness is really springy.

The springy soft tomato noodles with the big juicy dumplings make me crave for more!!
Not forgetting their Yokitori menu includes chicken meatball, chicken thigh, chicken with Japanese leek, pork belly, pork sausages, salmon belly, quail eggs and many more. Craving satisfied!
crispy and tossed over much salted egg yolk. sinful but yeah, the weekend is here. give up ur dieting plans.
on the pricier side but it was tasty! 
As per my best understanding, the original food stalls from the demolished Ayer Raja Crescent hawker centre which moved to a temporary tent nearby has been invited back to the latest iconic dining spot in Singapore. It may not be the best chicken rice in town but it definitely has its followers after all these years.
What about you?
Glad that they are now at Timbre+ which is much nearer to home. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #bakkutteh #bkt #soonhuatbakkutteh #timbreplus #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood

The tomato noodles has a hint of sweetness on top of the springy bite but the char siew can be better. Not to  forget their plump dumplings that is stuffed with delightful ingredients. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #wongkeewantonnoodle #tomatonoodle #charsiew #wantonmee #dumpling  #timbreplus
1 Muslim Restaurant in Timbre+ ; a pretty gargantuan portion of coconut rice, crispy anchovies and peanuts, sambal chili and chicken wing for only $3 üëç || make sure to visit before 1pm to avoid the disappointment of a sold-out situation
At Wang Jiao Ban Mian, I would recommend trying the Dry Ban Mian ($3.30). The bowl of dry ban mian comes with a perfectly cooked egg, ikan bilis and chewy homemade noodle. All these are hold together by the savoury dark sauce, bringing everything together.
I had a bite of the pastry, stuffed with the aromatic rendang and I could not stop eating. Flaky and flavourful. This is a must try.
Premium Fishball Noodles. Douglas makes his fish balls and fish cakes from scratch using yellow tail fish only. His usual day starts from 4am to make the fish balls and fish cakes, even the sambal chilli and pork lard. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #fishball #fishballnoodle  #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood
Yes! That\'s what it is!
Kaisendon
I would recommend having their Char Siew Dumpling Tomato Noodles and Beef Brisket Spinach Noodle. The tomato noodles has a hint of sweetness on top of the springy bite but the char siew can be better. I would suggest trying the beef brisket spinach noodle. The beef brisket cooked with more then 15 different spices and stewed for hours is really flavourful and tender. The savoury sauce pairs excellently with the noodles too. Another star at the stall is the chunky dumpling that is stuffed with crunchy chestnut bits, turnip and black fungus.

Brimming with so much ingredients, it really is quite an interesting and messy eat, with a Charcoal Crust barely holding a mixture of Duck Confit, Bacon, Prawn, Burnt Onions, smashed US Beef, Roasted Cabbage, and topped with Konbu Mayo, Balsamic Okonomiyaki Sauce, Crispy Bonito Flakes, Mozarella and Brie! Its insane just how much things there are inside this \'pizza\' worth $9! I felt as though i finished an entire pizza when in actual fact i couldnt even finish a slice of it! üò± Timbre+ is really some hipster hawker centre that houses some very interesting food #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #hawkerfood #cheapandgood #timbre+ #burpple
Weird or not? üôÉ Sweet potato fries topped with teriyaki sauce and melted marshmallows, and BBQ sauce on the side. From The World Is Flat by Tanuki Raw.
Crisp and well-balanced in flavour.

I am so happy that Timbre+ is finally open! 21 hawker stalls and 14 restaurant concepts all in one uber hip food hall. And guess what? There is a bar!!! Guys, its official. There is now some form of life in one-north. We decided to check out Dusk by Slake because Slake does really good food. The star dish has gotta be the pork rendang nachos. Tender cubes of pork in a nice creamy rendang sauce over crispy wanton skin. Genius or what? For mains, i reccomend the beef with borderlaise butter and pork with kicap manis sauce. The band that was playing was fantastic.

The young ones will definitely take to this and despite the heavy laden sauce, the batter still managed stay crisp underneath, and this even after an hour of chit chatting :)\n<br />#twowingssg #chickenwings #saltedeggyolk #saltedeggyolkwings #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #timbreplus \n<br />Avail at their latest outlet at the only food joint in Sg where you will seriously consider not using a tray to take your food
Accentuated by the hits of tomato infusion, the noodles are nicely cooked by the young lady boss, making it a hearty rendition and when accompanied by the generous and brilliant wantons (fried and boiled), it makes for an extremely appetising plate of food \n<br />On a less happy note, the ridiculous charging of $1 for the tray which can only be redeemed if you return it speaks down to us as Sg diners. I do feel the owners of timbre plus seriously reconsider this foolhardy idea as this does not promote civic mindedness. Rather, it makes us look like brainless idiots requiring a dollar to do the right thing. #dumbidea\n<br />#wongkeewantonnoodle #tomatonoodle #wantonmee #noodles #wantons #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #timbreplus

Beef brisket on spinach(green üíöin color)  noodles. Quite a long wait. Very aldente. Love the spicy chilli and the brisket gravy which was poured over the noodles. Overall, quite tasty. Personally wished there was a better \"service system\" in placeüòÑat the stall. Cost at $5.50 but the stall charge an extra $1 which is refundable upon returning your tray. If u intend to visit, go before 11.30 or after 2pm as it gets very very crowded. #beef #noodles #noodlelover #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burrple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggersg #igsg #igers #singaporeinsiders #foodstagram
