[Toa Payoh HDB Hub]
[HDB Hub, Toa Payoh] Specially made a trip down to Toa Payoh after work today to visit two iconic hawkers. The first stop is Hougang 6 Miles Famous Muah Chee for their famous black sesame and peanut muah chee ($2.50/$3.50/$5.50). While waiting for my muah chee to be made, I had a brief chat with the stall owners and they have been selling muah chee since 1952. The uncle will prepare the food while the auntie takes the order (P.S. Auntie is very camera shy). Their muah chee is made via the traditional method by firstly hand pulling the dough and kneading into a ball. Next, it goes into a process of dipping the balls in scallion oil (for the 古早味 flavour) before rolling over crushed peanut or black sesame. Lastly, once the balls has been fully coated with the peanut or black sesame, they are then cut in small bite-sized pieces. Towards the end of our conversation, the auntie sadly mentioned that they will be retiring in a few years time as their family members are not willing to take over the stall. Hence, for all you muah chee lovers, rush down to try this black and white combination before they close shop in a few years time. Even Michael Jackson would given the thumbs up to this stall ~ \"it don\'t matter if you\'re black or white\" 🎶
Softer and less elastic than the usual muah chee (glutinous rice flour balls), the dough here is divided into tidy bite-sized morsels not with scissors, but BY HAND. I prefer the traditional ground peanut coating, which isn\'t inundated with sugar and so fine that it\'s melts effortlessly in the mouth. 
Super underrated Cheng Tng located in the heartlands of Singapore.

Black sesame and peanut mua chee from the famous Hougang 6 Miles at Toa Payoh@HDB Hub. I definitely have tried some of similar standard at some pasar malam before but not with black sesame as i believe that this is only available here.
It was flavourful, light and fluffy, but a tad expensive for the price of $3.50 though.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #eeeeets #exploresingaporeeats #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #foodstagram #igfood #instafood_sg #onthetable #sgeats #sgfood #sgfooddiary #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodunion #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #singaporefoodies #sgig #whati8today #muahchee
[$5.50]
Peanut &amp; Black Sesame
These glutinous rice balls are so soft and fluffy, that it\'s like giving your tongue a sweet spa treatment. After eating this daily for a few days, I still couldn\'t decide if I like the peanut or sesame side better... #igsg #sg #Singapore #burpple #sg #sgfoodtrend #igsg #instafood #whati8today #sgig #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #foodstagram #sgfooddiary #instafoodsg #foodgasm #SGMakanDiary #ginpala #eatbooksg #singaporeinsiders #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #snacksfordays #singaporesnacks #localsnacks #muahchee #localdesserts #sgdessert #foodies #sghawker #sghawkerfood
The muah chee is soft and yummy👍🏻 Should have bought the $5.50 portion instead😞😂 #burpple
Order the black &amp; white version, best of both worlds!

You get to choose the muah chee with peanut or black sesame! Love the soft and chewy muah chee with fine grinded peanut/sesame and not too sweet! 😋👍🏻 #burpple #singapore #igsg #sgig #photography #photooftheday #exploresg  #instafood #instatravel #foodporn #foodgasm #bbctravel #travel #travelgram #exploresingapore #jiaklocal #onthetable #asian #eatoutsg  #explore #sgfoodie #onthetable #wanderlust #sgdessert #hawker #dessert #childhood
😍 Used to always have muah chee from this stall when i was still staying in Hougang! \n<br />#burpple #singapore #igsg #sgig #videography #videooftheday #exploresg  #instafood #instatravel #foodporn #foodgasm #bbctravel #travel #travelgram #exploresingapore #jiaklocal #onthetable #asian #eatoutsg  #explore #sgfoodie #onthetable #wanderlust #sgdessert #hawker #videogram #video
The muah chee was unexpectedly flavourful as the little bits of sticky flour was dipped in fried shallot oil before it\'s mixed with the black sesame, which is an unusual but tasty combination itself. Each bite offered a tinge of sweetness, followed by a strong savoury roasted taste because of the black sesame. Try the 鸳鸯 (black sesame and peanut) version if you\'re ordering the medium sized one ($3.50) 😌👍🏻 #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #tslmakan #sgeats #muahchee #burpple #burpplesg #exploresingapore #igsg #onthetable #whati8today #thelocal5everpiggie
Magical !! \n<br />Must be the shallots oil... Yummy yum yum
And I ate two plates of this 😅😅😂😂😂 #happybelly and #happyweekend!
Smooth &amp; chewy, the higher price tag deems it a luxury delicacy.\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 3.8/5\n<br />Worth your calories? Consider it sold.\n<br />📷 Credits: @blancheeze &amp; @cake.cass
It\'s super delicious!!! The muah chee is more soft and chewy than the usual. And the sesame and peanut powder added on it is sweet enough for my tasting. #burpple
First time seeing  black muah chee . #food#foodporn#burpple\n<br />#foodie#Singapore#instafood_sg\n<br />#foodstagram#instafood#muahchee
Black sesame muah chee!! 🌚 ps: Located at HBD hub\'s basement food court though.🤔
