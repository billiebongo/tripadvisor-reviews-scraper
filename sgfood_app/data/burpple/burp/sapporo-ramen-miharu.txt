#1 Special blended Miso „Äã$14.80
#9 Special Soy Sauce „Äã$14.80
This was much better than the miso with garlic oil version (both at $14.80). I still haven\'t found the taste that I like.
Thick soup that tasted bitter to me, I wasn\'t impressed by the flavour of this miso tonkotsu. At $14.80, it\'s fairly priced but it\'s not on my top 5 list.
$14.80. If you love springy noodles! Yummy broth. 
$16.50, this seafood stock shoyu based ramen was very rich and flavourful, reminded me of the tsukemen broth from Santouka but lighter.
This was a tad too strong in garlic taste but it was good nonetheless.

Tokusen Miso Ramen | Ahh the corn! But there was a slight alkaline taste for the noodles :/
Just like the very first bowl some 10 years ago.
Remembering how a nihonjin was gulping down his bowl of pickled vege rice bowl with his shoyu ramen. That got me so intrigued to try his method of eating his ramen. And I never looked back (nor looked down, at my tummy) ever since. 
We got the number 1(miso tonkuzen) and number 11(seafood based shoyu) and Gyoza and Dashimaki tamago for sides. Both soups were very delicious! But a warning for the seafood based shoyu is that it can get a bit ge lad. I love the springy noodles! We requested that they cook the noodles till hard and it was well executed. The Dashimaki tamago is light and tasty while the Gyoza was flavourful. 
It sure was good, but would have preferred to have some sweet corn and towgay to refresh the taste buds from the very thick and flavourful soup.
Miharu has moved to Millenia and is now closed at Robertson Quay. Menu is updated again and my usual choice is now #13. Still as good, and the space is 3x bigger. Ramen in comfort! 
Still my favorite ramen shop after 9 years.  Springiest noodles in Singapore, hands down.
4 munchies: I\'m not usually a fan of miso-based ramen, but the broth in this bowl was packed with rich miso and pork flavours. The noodles were especially springy and eggs were nicely done. I also loved the buttered sweet corn topping that authentically enhanced the overall flavours and textures in this bowl of Sapporo ramen!
So good that I want to swim in this.
What I really love about this ramen joint is it\'s quality in the variety of ramen they serve (pork, shio, mix, dry, chicken etc..) unlike the others who usually have only 1 or 2 good items on the menu. This is ramen #12, with chicken shio broth &amp; mini eggs. A light, clear, yet flavorful choice. Love it!
As always, my favorite ramen in Singapore, always eating it with my bestie. $20 + dollars for this awesomeness is totally worth it every once in a while. 
Still as good as the first bowl I had some 8 years ago!
My first time trying a bowl of dipping ramen. Broth was intense, so what I\'ll recommend is to bathe your noodles with the broth, and then drain it lightly. Flavor will be just right! 
You know you\'ve come to the right place when close to 80% of the diners are Japanese. The word of Miharu\'s almost life-changing ramen has been spreading quietly, but rapidly. The comfortable, quiet, calming vibe of Miharu sets the perfect tone for the salty, creamy, luscious broth, and chewy Sapporo ramen. Go for #11, the Tonkotsu Miso ramen - you\'ll be licking your bowl down to the last drop.
So good that it has become a weekly fixture.
My favorite choice here! Better than the no.1 I\'ve been ordering all this time. Broth was rich but not salty. Highly recommended. 80% of customers are Japanese. Says a lot!
2nd time in a week. 
Pipping hot broth. Incredible Flavors. Starting to be my fav ramen in Singapore.
Shiso Gyoza - Pan fried dumpling with perilla leaf
Tamago Yaki (Omelette)
Tokusen ton shio ramen! Special pork flavored broth with rich salt taste! 
I\'ve finally found a ramen place to rival Ippudo. Miharu is located in an obscure corner of Martin &amp; Nanson, this 20 seater serves a special blend of broth of both pork and miso. The broth was piping hot, bright and a little on the salty side, while the Sapporo ramen was pitch perfect. The worthy comparison to Ippudo\'s kept ringing in my mind..
This is their special menu for this time. 
Miharu does maintain its consistency through the years. üòâ #sapporo#ramen#miharu

Saw good reviews from many blogs saying that this ramen tasted great so I went to try it out.. The broth for the shio ramen is unique and tasty, however I don‚Äôt quite fancy the noodles.. #jinhojiak #ramen #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #instafood #instafood_sg #singaporefood #singapore #igsg #foodgasm #foodsg #burpple #nofilter #latergram #throwback #20151229
Must come try this. Love the shio and miso versions. And their spicy has real kick too!
The noodles are served slightly chilled and every strand is delightfully springy. \n<br />The subtle piquant flavour of the broth is the result of the citrus soy sauce and differentiates Sapporo from their competitors.\n<br />To me, this is comfort food for the cold and rainy weather in December
They are probably still getting used to the kitchen so given them a little time.
My favourite. Super bouncy noodles. Includes half a seasoned egg.

Warm springy Hokkaido-style miso ramen.  Perfect for the weather.
