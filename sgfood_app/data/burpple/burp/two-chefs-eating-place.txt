Good but very rich. A bit too sweet with the milk powder though. 
This drunken prawns soup is what I need right now, with its sufficiently strong herbal taste. Its fragrance would evoke your sense of smell the moment it\'s placed on your table. The next sensation would be the seemingly mild herbal taste detected by your tastebuds, but as you sip it more and more from your spoon, your tongue would start to taste a bittersweet flavour, thanks to the danggui and wolfberries. And this will get stronger and stronger as you resist the temptation to not drink it too fast. The juicy tiger prawns would be the last to get conquered because of their sweet succulent flesh. Half would be dipped in the lovely soup while the other half would get the privilege of sambal chilli (yes, that\'s how they call it even though sambal and chilli means the same to me). This would definitely be a great warmth in this chilly weather.
Cereal, milk powder and dip-fried battered prawn. The golden batter is light without overpowering the sweet succulent prawns. At first I suspected that the batter would be so thick that the prawns were almost nothing, but I was proven wrong. The cereal and milk powder suit each other so well that you can eat them with plain rice alone. Too addictive!
Personally, i liked the coffee pork ribs more. Both are nice. Meat tender. Just that i don\'t fancy the milk powder over the butter pork ribs. Have order their fried rice, cereal pawns, omelette, seafood hor fun, sweet &amp; sour fish. I must say all items were good. Overall, worth dining. Side note: you can only order once, no additional order during dining.
One of the best kind of sin. Condensed milk powder. Good thing this dish was placed far away from me, or I would be stuffing my face with it. 
Love their food nice &amp; cheap!
No butter too much.
Soaked in some secret recipe sauce and plenty of chopped garlic, spring onion and chill. This is surely appetizing. I can finish a plate of this to myself. \n<br />#sgfood #sharefood #burpple #igsg #foodie #iweeklyfood
So we are hoping it will snow. Snowing on our food today.
This was the only interesting dish they had. The rest of the things we ate weren\'t exciting and the service was bad. Even got diarrhea from eating their food. Don\'t recommend this place..

Must try dishes: Marmite Chicken, Butter Pork Ribs, Chilli Crab with fried Mantous
Super interesting and delish dish in the west. Milky butter powder scattered on generous amount of pork just for $8. To my surprise the pork wasn\'t as dry as it looks. The buttery flavour was just nice and fragrant. Highly recommend it to people who love creamy food.
Still one of my favourite Tze Char places. The dishes all cost between $8-$12. Ain\'t a fan of pork but can\'t help falling in love with this yummilicious butter pork ribs! It\'s definitely a must have at Two Chefs! 
A sweet ending to the day - fitting for someone as sweet as you! (;
Have to say that #chillicrab is not a specialty at @TwoChefs zi char. A little bit overcooked and tough. However, that #eggy #chilli sauce has that right balance of sweetness and spiciness.
the fact that frying chicken and sprinkling milk powder on it can be even called a dish. it\'s not to my liking. what\'s ur take on it ?
Tze char for dinner. So yummmm! I love the butter ribs &amp; the cockles! 😋😋😋
My favourite order from two chefs asides their drunken cockles and butter ribs. Only because I indulge in salted egg yolk despite the cholesterol that comes along with it\'s goodness. :( Remember to order more if you\'re eating with friends cause a small plate isn\'t really sufficient!
It\'s a well known dish if you know Two Chefs. Tried it the first time at Sin Ming and in my honest opinion, this one from Commonwealth is way fresher and tastier. This is a must order for cockles lover, the seasoning was just perfect, strewn with finely chopped garlic, chilli padi and spring onions. 我还要。。。
Everyone flocks to Two Chefs for their famous Butter Pork Ribs, but you should also order regular favourites like the Salted Egg Prawns and Golden Mushroom Beancurd. If you like cockles, you won\'t be disappointed with their fresh garlic and chili cockles. Prepare to queue, this is a popular spot for groups of friends, with their reasonable prices and generous portions. 
Finally tried 2 chef\'s buttery pork ribs.. imo not worth the q...
vegetable with egg, salted egg &amp; century egg (three-egg spinach)
butter pork ribs
dried shrimp omelette
drunken cockles
Very fortunate to be in Singapore, where we get cuisines of all kind. You may wonder What Is This? This is Two Chefs\' Butter Pork Ribs, looking like snow flakes over meat and it is soooo goood! #instavideo
Fried juicy pork ribs stirred fried with butter and coated with butter milk powder. It really has an out of this world taste. In order to avoid the crowd, diners should come before 6.30pm. The prices for each dish ranges from $8-$16 depending on the portions and types of dishes. Basically for a group of 6, the medium portion should be enough. Oh wells... #TGIF\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#zhichar #kopitiamfood #SGfood #foodie #foodporn #foodpath #foodblog #foodjourney #foodstagram #jiakpahliao #tiamjiakgui #ieatishootipost #l4l #likeforlike #likeback #followback #burpple #burrplesg
Anyway, Tze Char or Zi Char, whichever way you spell it (I personally prefer the former) is something close to every Singaporean\'s hearts. I don\'t profess to know which stores in Sg offers the best but the ones I\'d @ Two Chefs Eating Place is memorable. I say go for the Drunken Cockles (ask for extra spicy), Spinach with 3 kinds of Egg (regular / centuary / salted) &amp; Butter Pork Ribs.\n<br />~\n<br />PS: Not sure why the latter\'s so called but the Butter Pork Ribs come covered with condensed milk powder &amp; is strangly addictive.\n<br />~\n<br />Pic taken @ Two Chefs Eating Place (Commonwealth)\n<br />116 Commonwealth Crescent\n<br /># 01-129\n<br />Singapore 140116\n<br />Phone: 6472 5361\n<br />Operating Hours: Tue - Sun\n<br /> Lunch\n<br />11:30am - 2:30pm\n<br />Dinner\n<br />5pm - 11:30pm\n<br />Mon\n<br />5pm - 11:30pm (Only Dinner) \n<br />Closed: Every Last Mon of the Month\n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TwoChefsEatingPlace\n<br />~
Maybe that\'s why so many toddlers are addicted to their milk bottles filled with formula milk...

Cheap and awesome. 5 dishes $54
We discovered a dish that was better than the highly raved butter pork ribs (which had an acquired taste) - Claypot Chicken!! The sauce with the strong ginger taste was awesome, but could do if was less salty! Other dishes like the 3-egg spinach and the golden mushroom beancurd was equally greatt. \n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #2chefs #tzechar #sgeats #exploresingapore #jiaklocal #onthetable #igsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #tslmakan #stfoodtrending

While looking for a place to dine for the evening, I could not accept that there\'s no yummy food in the west. Alas I was proven right. An interesting take on the short ribs. Similar to the cereal prawn but this is just with buttermilk. Interesting and delicious. #wueat #sgeat #sgfood #sgfoodie #instaeat #instafood #instafoodie #8dayseat #foodie #food #west #singapore #delicious #burpple
