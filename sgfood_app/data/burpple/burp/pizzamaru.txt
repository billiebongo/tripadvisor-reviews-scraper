If you‚Äôre familiar with the Korean honey butter chips, this was like that albeit sweeter, in fried chicken form! The crispy coat wasn‚Äôt too thick and meat was rather tender and moist.
Instead of the usual crust, we got the Gold Edge crust (+ $3.20 for 9‚Äù, $5.50 for 12‚Äù) for this, which is a crust made with two cheeses and sweet potato mousse. This surprisingly came out well, a savory sweet combination that helped to balance out the generous cheese fillings! We didn‚Äôt quite mind it, but the mangoes didn‚Äôt quite stand out among the rest of the toppings like shrimp, scallop, squid, onion, mushroom, black olive, broccoli and mozzarella cheese. Also, the spicy buldak sauce used here pushed the spice level up quite a notch, recommended if you are a fan of the heat!
If you‚Äôve ever complained about the lack of cheese in your pizzas, Pizza Maru‚Äôs signature Chicago style pizzas have got your back. Each of these pizzas use 600g (!!!) of cheese that are double layered, along with pepperoni, tomato, tomato sauce, icing sugar and parsley flakes. 
Really a tower of ingredients here - rice with seaweed, chicken spam, fried egg, and a mixture of kimchi, bell pepper, onions, mushroom, cabbage, cheese, siracha sauce and a handful of potato crisps strips. Taste wise it‚Äôs pretty much what you‚Äôd expect but the variety of textures was a nice touch.
Sweet-spicy Mango Ocean - comes with shrimp, scallop, squid, onion, mushroom, black olive, broccoli, mozzarella cheese, mango, pilaf sauce, and spicy budak sauce assembled on a green tea dough.
Not one who likes to combine sweet and savoury flavours in a dish but the Honey Butter Coat fried chicken from Pizza Maru was pretty addictive. Might be slightly sweet for some, but the tender and juicy chicken would still leave you wanting more. I preferred the Garlic Soy flavour, and was surprised that it wasn‚Äôt as salty as some other establishments.
