Da best baked crab u can find in Singapore!
So much wok hei in those noodles, to contrast with the crisp, jade coloured greens.
JQ Pot‚Äôs Cheesy Hotpot ($38) is served with a cheese fondue and 18 sticks of lok lok. The cheese is a combination of nacho cheese and mozzarella. While the food was nothing to shout about, this unique concept is worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the area.\n<br />~\n<br />Full review at http://eatbook.sg/jq-pot/\n<br />~\n<br />Writer: @azaleaamzzz\n<br />Photographer: @johnjohnah

Max painstakingly prepares the mutton every morning, marinating them with fermented beancurd and seared in hot oil to remove the gaminess. This is a tedious job and I really appreciate the effort to serve us a delicious bowl of mutton soup.

Many people may worry about the gaminess but the mutton is tediously prepared every morning, marinating them with fermented beancurd and seared in hot oil to remove the gaminess.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #mutton

Succulent crab flesh dipped in spicy chili crab sauce. Shiok!
so apt that we got this fitbit like gadget.
the salt bake crab was as good as those I had in the restaurants, while also having good ole sambal stingray.

#linecamera Today drop by at the pasir panjang food center. My intention is to have satay at tis place. I tried several stalls before but this Alan bbq seafood caught my eye, and decided to give it a try since very long never eat the seafood here. The stingray turns out to be one of the few stores that is quite nice. Worth to try.
