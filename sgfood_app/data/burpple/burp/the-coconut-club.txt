Must try! Now open for dinner service. Lovely staff and awesome food. Ordered mostly from off-the-menu items and enjoyed all of them - especially the #beefrendang - so soft, flavourful and sedap. Thanks for the complimentary chicken - chef insisted we must try! It was good (love the crispy skin) but too stuffed to try the desserts! Hope to be back soon to give those a try!

And it was exactly what they did. Everything on the plate was on point, and they had definitely elevated our local dish to restaurant quality. \n<br />Dining here could be preceded with a queue unless you come early as their business was really thriving. Guessed they had done it right in all ways. Good location, modern interior with nostalgic touch, right target market with the pricing and ingredient used. Lastly of course, good quality food. \n<br />There were a few side dishes and seasonal specials, in addition to the Nasi Lemak which would be their main item on the menu. Coming here in a group of 4-5 would be ideal to be able to sample more of these items. Do check out their Chendol too, loved its richness without being overly sweet. \n<br />Pricier it might be but we would return since it would be good quality and good taste that we are paying for.
No chen-doldrums with Coconut Club\'s version of this classic -- a finely shaved ice island fairly glistening with viscuous gula melaka that\'s well intense on the brown sugar quotient. Under the lake of freshly squeezed coconut milk - which by the way is fantastically fragrant, creamy and not at all cloying - the jelly noodles are pale green with a pleasantly mild taste of pandan and dissolves pleasingly when pressed with the tongue to the roof of your mouth.
The titular namesake of the dish could have benefitted from a stronger infusion of coconut and pandan, but was otherwise fabulously fluffy and served it\'s primary role of sambal chilli carrier admirably. Of the sambal itself, I liked that it packed just the right amount of smooth spiciness and heat without veering into overly cloying territory.
Coconut Rice, Chicken Leg, Ikan Bilis, Peanuts, Cucumber, Fried Egg and Sambal
Could not get enough of that fragrant coconut rice, super sinful fried chicken and chunky otah. Definitely worth a visit!

I\'ve probably found my favorite chendol in Singapore. Chendol is my favorite dessert, and I\'ve eaten many chendol in the region. This is one of the best, but only if you remind them to cut down on the gula melaka.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />My review of the four components of this chendol:\n<br />üëçüèª The green squiggly thing called chendol has pandan fragrance and it was soft, not chewy.\n<br />üëçüèª Coconut milk was fragrant and lemak, and I really love how the coconut milk smells here.\n<br />üëçüèª Shaved ice was fine and not too hard, but at the fineness of bingsu or snow ice but smooth for local iced dessert.\n<br />ü§ûüèª Gula melaka was fragrant and like butterscotch. It shouldn\'t overpower the coconut milk, but they added too much gula melaka here.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />My first bowl had the right balance of coconut milk and gula melaka, but my second bowl had way too much gula melaka which overshadowed the delicate fragrance from the coconut milk. If less gula melaka was used, this would be perfect.
Did you know Coconut Club, famous or infamous for their $12.80 nasi lemak serves kueh kosui too?\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The texture is pretty good - soft, mushy and with enough bounce. It\'s flavoured by gula melaka but it isn\'t too sweet. But qualm is that the taste of alkaline is present here, so my favourite kueh kosui is still from Maxwell Market.
The Coconut Club‚Äôs standard nasi lemak includes coconut rice, ikan bilis, sambal chilli, cucumber, fried egg and fried chicken leg.
It came with chicken leg, ikan bilis, peanuts, cucumber, fried egg and sambal. The taste is alright, it was good in certain ways but I\'ve reservations.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I like the crispy ikan bilis and berempah wings. The coconut milk fragrance coming from the rice is very pleasant but could be stronger. The rice would appeal to those who prefer their rice to be hard and chewy (think: punggol nasi lemak rice), but I like my rice to be soft and fluffy (think: adam road selera rasa).\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Because of my strong preference for soft and fluffy rice, the nasi lemak here (despite its pleasant but light coconut milk fragrance) doesn\'t cut it for me.
However if your tongue grew up with Nasi Lemak that uses only coconut milk that is freshly \'perah\' (Malay for squeezed) from fresh Malaysian coconut, your internal senses will tell you something is different, until someone tells you why. You can read online they really do use freshly squeezed coconut milk to prepare their Nasi of their Nasi Lemak. Kelapa from Selangor, processed in Batu Pahat, then freshly perah in Singapura. The Ayam Goreng Berempah sungguh legit. Entah apa rempah was mixed in, it is not too much of everything that you will have a nagging taste of \'jintan manis\' in it. The sambal ok for me, good... but doesn\'t have the ummph compared to what my Mum makes with rehydrated cuttlefish. Maybe they would do that for their sambal in future. While we were queuing this table of Uncle and Aunty food was just less than an arm length away and he was telling me what he likes and what he doesn\'t. He says he stays where Punggol NL is, come here to try coz the Aunties want to try. He isn\'t impressed with the rice, he says PNL is nicer, but he says the Otak and Ayam Goreng is nice. Fish he said no good, a little fishy, so he said don\'t waste your appetite on that. $12.80 is the price we paid for the Nasi Lemak. You decide if you would queue to try it. I\'ll bring the parents and in-laws to try though. Only their tongue can remember the old school taste of \'single origin coconut\' in the Nasi Lemak.
Quite shiok for a hot afternoon. I like that the gula melaka is thick. Worth trying!
Visited this place cos running out of (new) places for lunch. It\'s not bad lah but I\'ve had nicer (&amp; cheaper) Nasi Lemak. The rice could have been more fragrant and sambal a little more spicy. Otherwise, chicken was done well - damm crispy and quite a big piece. 
Of course with a high prices, expectations go up.\n<br />-\n<br />Rumors say, they use fresh coconut milk which is squeezed by hand, thus the rice turns out softer and more fragrant. Add on half a fried chicken that\'s crispy and juicy, sambal and all the works, it makes up a satisfying lunch meal.\n<br />-\n<br />Its air conditioned, its fragrant and satisfying. What\'s not to love but perhaps a spicier sambal :)\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #thecoconutclubsg
Ex and gimmicky, or real good stuff? I am all for the local delicacies moving into restaurants, bistros and cafes. \n<br />In fact, this can be a way our humble hawker food can be elevated up, and perhaps attract more young ‚Äòhawkerpreneurs‚Äô to enter the tough and challenging industry.
Price aside, the rice was flavourless, sambal was neither sweet nor spicy and the egg was overcooked. The best part was definitely the chicken but I doubt I\'ll be back just for that again.
With a compact menu that carries only one main, you know the people there at The Coconut Club are rather serious about their Nasi Lemak - Ayam Goreng Berumpah. Permeating with the comforting and signature aroma of nasi lemak, do expect a refine plate of coconut milk rice priced at $12.80 when you step in. Artisanal Nasi Lemak, perhaps?? Each plate comes with coconut rice, chicken leg, ikan bilis, peanuts, sliced cucumber, fried egg and sambal.
With rice from the much emphasized on freshly hand-squeezed coconut milk, had expected it to be rich in flavor but it was not too cloying and instead, fluffy, light and subtly fragrant. The fried chicken was well-executed, its batter tasty with a lovely hint of lemongrass and good, well-balanced taste of the spices, the exterior crisp while remaining moist and juicy inside. I was appreciative of how not-spicy the tasty sambal was but some people may wish there was a little more punch (and sweetness). And of course there\'s your typical crunchy ikan bilis, peanuts and fried egg, this one with runny yolk that exploded before @vanessa_kou could take a photo. While a hefty price tag of $12.80, this is overall, a pretty good refined plate of nasi lemak that makes up for it in quality. Worth giving it a try when you\'re in the area.
This casual air-conditioned joint serves only one main on the menu ‚Äî Nasi Lemak ($12.80) and an amazingly good Cendol ($3.80) that you cannot leave without trying. Ice shaved till it\'s soft as snow and drizzled with a generous dose of gula Melaka, it\'s a dessert that we recommend having one on your own. But first, back to the Nasi Lemak. Having attended a Nasi Lemak Convention in Malaysia (yes it\'s an actual event) and realising that Singapore had nothing quite as spectacular as what they tried there, three foodie friends decided to set up their own nasi lemak hut here. Before you gripe about how it\'s a rip-off, the quadrupled pricetag can be justified by the use of high quality ingredients. For one, the coconut used is specially imported from a plantation in Malaysia, and everything from its meat to its water is processed right in the kitchen. The massive chicken leg is lightly battered with hints of lemongrass and ginger, much like how it is done as a penyet. Definitely worth a try, at least once!\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hilary See
Not a must order but worth a try! Fresh fish otak with big fish chunks in it. Best to share with a friend! üå∂
Fragrant coconut rice with a massive chicken leg, served with the tastiest (thank goodness it\'s not the spiciest!) sambal on the side. Love how fresh everything is, slightly pricey but definitely worth every penny! #Burpproved
From The Coconut Club which serves Chendol and Nasi Lemak. Each plate goes for $12.80 here; all comes with coconut rice, chicken leg, Ikan Bilis and peanuts. Prices may sound high but it\'s pretty much refined here if you are willing to spend more for the local classic here; the rice is sufficiently moist without being mushy and comes with a light whiff of coconut aroma. The sunny side up had a runny yolk that flows, while the Ikan Bilis were crisp without being hard while adequately salted for flavour. Chili on the side is more spicy than it is being sweet but manageable overall. The chicken was however the true star of the dish; think lightly-battered but crisp chicken with a hint of lemongrass that is all tender and flavourful ‚Äî possibly everyone\'s favourite part of the dish. Sure, it does come at a premium as compared to the usual Nasi Lemak but it definitely compensates in terms of quality you are paying for with every extra penny spent.

üç®Given that this dessert often tastes artificial especially the ones in SG, I\'m proud to report that The Coconut Club has perfected this classic dessert. Here, the Cendol ($3.80) is creamy and milky, and they didn\'t stinge on adding gula melaka. Finely shaved ice is topped with freshly squeezed coconut milk, which was very fragrant, creamy, and surprisingly not cloying; the gula melaka gave such characteristic fragrance while not overpowering the coconut milk. The homemade pandan rice flour¬†jelly is pale green and squishy in texture, when you mash them to the roof of your mouth, it sets off a natural pandan flavour. Overall, a very well-balanced and great dessert to end the meal! Still so awed by this great find and can\'t wait to go back for their other coconut dishes üòã PS we were there at 3pm near closing and they offered us both bowls on the house. How sweet was that!

Ok, that\'s all.
Looks simple but time consuming to make. My most liked was the salat (green color one).. for its sweet pandanous soft texture, the chewy glutinous rice. Mini chopsticking my kueh kueh for slow and steady enjoyment. Yumz!
With all my might, the spirit is willing but sigh.... the flesh is weak. Whoever can resist the strong tempting aroma of coconut and pandan wafting in the air?\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />There were mixed reviews on the nasi lemak here. Should the highlight be the rice or the condiments or the entire dish?  I have always liked the fried chicken, simply because it was deep fried with lemon grass and crispy whilst the interior remained juicy &amp; moist. Today\'s rice was aromatic, however, it could have been slightly fluffier. I wished they would bring the heat from the sambal up a notch or two. The added spicyness would definitely give the dish more üëä.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />We left the place very full and satisfied.

Here I am, back from a week of missing local food and the first thing in mind was a good plate of coconut laded rice. To my surprise, the rice is even more fragrant than last Nov when I first tried and the sides seems to increase in quantity and quality! It\'s pretty rare that despite its steady following,(judging from the queue) this eatery continue to elevate its game and with that mind, this easily makes it one of my favorite places to get my Nasi Lemak Fix!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#angsianghill#nasilemaksg#coconutclub#coconutrice#nasilemak#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Is there a saying that goes... bring in the old and out with the new?? Is old fashion the new black?? Lol! I dont know what I am saying. Best to enjoy my kueh kueh silently.
Just simple white rice cooked in coconut milk turning it into an aromatic fragrant staple.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />So this is my 3rd time here. The rice is soft and fluffy but if I were to compare against the first time I had it.... it does not seem as fragrant as I felt the coconut milk was alittle mild. What was consistent was the fried chicken. Moist and juicy. Most fave part ... you guessed it... super crispy skin infused with lemongrass. Love the tangyness and the zest that cuts through the grease. Egg with the sides so golden brown and crisp. The sambal chilli that unites every single component on the plate. I prefer my sambal chilli to be spicier or the \"fireworks\" effect one get biting into a bird\'s eye chilli.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />There was another slight difference on my plate. The portion of rice was smaller. I mentioned my observation to one of the staff.  It was actually to reduce wastage (good idea) but top up of rice is provided if one feels it is not sufficient to fill the growling tummy. For me it was a decent portion.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Service is good and what impressed me was that a couple of the staff remembered me. A teeny unpleasant incident after my meal, not a biggie to the extent of spoiling an enjoyable dining experience.\n<br />Also shout out to the lovely female staff @thecoconutclubsg .. thank you for being my handmodel.
Chendol ($3.80)
Otah ($8.50)
Brown sugar gives it the brown color. Steamed and coated in shredded coconut. A very old school snack.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />This was made inhouse at the eatery. Not too sweet, squishy and chewy. Not the best but I like it as it tasted freshly made. This kuih was given complimentary to every diner after the meal. Nice touch to put smiles on the customers.
I thought it is rather pricey. My consolation is that it actually tasted quite good, well spiced and comes with chunky pieces of fish meat in it.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #thecoconutclubsg #otah #localfood #jiaklocal
Lala quite fresh but sambal is too sweet for me
Everything was good
Not bad but not impressive
So I traipsed my way to The Coconut Club. A little birdie told me this is not on the menu. So I was lucky they had it today but you have to ask for it.\n<br />üîºüîº\n<br />Ordered nasi lemak separately garnished with peanuts, ikan bilis and cucumber. The clams came in its own bowl but I prefer to mix it up with the rice and create a mess. Somehow it looks more delish. Well.. the clams looked spicy. But I prefer it to be spicier, with more added heat to have that extra \"oomph\". Perhaps some might like it just the way it is.\n<br />üîºüîº\n<br />It is also a wonderful feeling that \"kopi uncle\" remembered me even tho this was only my second time visit. \n<br />#lunch #nasilemak #hungrygowhere #burpple #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #igfoodies #followforfollow #eatbooksg #discoversg #thecoconutclubsg #
It is the special of the day. I am glad that we ordered it. The spicy sambal complemented the sweetness of the la la excellently.

The balanced of coconut milk, evaporated milk and gula melaka, together with the green chendol jellies has opened my eyes or rather my taste buds what is really a good bowl of cendol.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #chendol
While the rice of the Nasi Lemak ($12.80) is well infused with the scent of coconut, an untrained tongue like mine is not able to tell the difference from the many good ones out there. The other highlight on the plate has to be the Ayam Goreng Beremaph also known as Crispy Spiced Fried Chicken. The tender and juicy chicken leg is given a light coat of crispiness, bursting with the rich aroma of fresh herbs and spices. You can also find other ingredients such as ikan bilis, peanuts, cucumber, fried egg and sambal on the plate of nasi lemak.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #thecoconutclubsg #nasilemak #jiaklocal #localfood
Well worth the trip and calories. And of course, the coconut rice is the star. \n<br />Nasi Lemak ‚Ä¢ Rich savoury and elegant with fluffy perfectly cooked grains of goodness\n<br />Sambal ‚Ä¢ Anchovies ‚Ä¢ Peanuts ‚Ä¢ Well executed but clearly accompaniments to accentuate the rich. \n<br />Fried Egg ‚Ä¢ Perfectly oozy yolk and custard like whites, with spidery crispy fried edges. \n<br />Otah ‚Ä¢ Rich and tasty with whole chunks of fish\n<br />Fried Whole Fish - fresh and fried to perfection with a sweet and spicy black sauce. Nice crispy skin and tender well marinated flesh.\n<br />Fried Chicken ‚Ä¢ Nice Malay style chicken marinated with turmeric. Crispy feathery battered skin. Meat\'s decent too. \n<br />Chendol ‚Ä¢ Sago ‚Ä¢ Both were well crafted desserts where the coconut milk\'s the star. \n<br />Paired with a sweet Ros√© from Margaret River - Happs Fuchsia 2014. Nice sweetness and acidity holds up well to the rich food. Ros√© needs to be served really chilled though. \n<br />#food #FoodPorn #foodpornsg #foodandwine\n<br />#foodandwinepairing #igfood #instafood #sgfoodie #sgrestaurant #nasilemak #sambal #friedegg #friedfish #friedchicken #happs #margaretriver #Australia #burpple #margaretriverfirstclass #traditionalfood #singaporefood #coconutmilk #thecoconutclubsg #thecoconutclub
The chicken is still as crisp and well seasoned. Aa far as price goes, for $12.80 this is definitely worth every grain of rice.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #thecoconutclub #burpple
The otak-otak was quite good too. What I didn\'t like: the clumpy rice. Elevating local dishes is not new, just look at Islamic Restaurant (and their awesome briyani) so what @thecoconutclubsg has going for them is their fresh ingredients and the potential to push the quality of their nasi lemak. Clumpy rice aside, they are really formidable this side of town and somewhere I would take a group of clients to lunch on a weekday. #burpple #burpplesg #thegrowingbelly #jiaklocal #singapore #annsianghill #fujifilm_xseries #fujifilmxe1 #fujinon18mm #thecoconutclub
It\'s a betrayal for the purists but how can one resist that well fried chicken that is marinated right, tender on the inside and has a bloody good crisp on the outside.

This otak-otak stole the show on my maiden visit to @thecoconutclubsg . Gloriously dense with ground fish and the spices were well-mixed. The banana leaf opened up to this wonderfully moist creation. Nothing comes close to this, in the area; worth lining up just for it; unless you want to venture east or across the causeway. #burpple #burpplesg #thecoconutclubsg #thegrowingbelly #noodleeats #otakotak #jiaklocal #fujifilm_xseries #fujifilmxe1 #fujinon18mm #singapore #annsianghill #sglocalfood #sgfoodie

A club that I certainly want to be a part of, The Coconut Club not only serves a mouth-watering plate of Nasi Lemak (the only main on their menu) but they also do a mean bowl of Cendol ($3.80).
Seriously, my aunt is more in the know of hip food spots than I am these days. Thought we\'d beat the lunch crowd but the place was already buzzing by 11:30am. I like how they\'re focused on making one dish great and in an updated modernish setting, but when we could finally hear ourselves think (tables are really close and the lady seated beside us was really loud), we couldn\'t help but wonder why there weren\'t any other ingredients like red beans and attap chee in the super lemak and yummy chendol?\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#nasilemak #annsianghill #asianfood #rice #burpple #lunch #whatiate #sgfood #eatout

Despite a broken rice machine while we were there, they did a fantastic recovery. I was truly impressed by how they handled the situation. We got our rice in the end but the rice was a little underdone. But for the effort  they made to put food on my table, I was grateful. The meal was free at the end but I would have gladly paid for it.

The menu is simple and basically, it only sells nasi lemak.! And maybe about 3-4 sides!  Anyway.. my plate arrive after 20mins  and low and behold... my first bite! The rice indeed has this \'good quality coconut milk\' taste that it somehow feels healthy! üòõ chicken is pretty good too as it has a unique seasoning and also served as a whole chicken thigh.! Sambal and the fried chicken berumpah made good compliments to my rice too..

I liked the slightly burnt taste of the caramelized palm sugar but @rhythmof_grace lamented the lack of beans in the filling.
Friends said I drink only artisanal coffee with pretty latteart. But surprise!! I do drink kopitiam kopi now and then.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />So while I was snapping this, kopi uncle was happily explaining how he makes his coffee. I notice he \"heats\" up the cup with hot water many times. He steeps the coffee powder in another metal pitcher before \"tariking\" (pull) it in the long nosed pitcher. The coffee is the coffeeshop\'s own blend. And he asked me which normally many kopitiams dont do... how do you like your kopi? Sweet or kopi kau? I liked kau and not too sweet.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />He went on and lamented this traditional way of preparing kopi is a dying trade. Anyway, I had my cuppa. Kopi uncle walked to me and asked how is the kopi (which most kopitiams dont do). My answer : Kau kau with abit of sweetness and a tinge of smokyness. I like. Kopi uncle happily went away.  Slurped!
As the name suggest, one might think it is a club for coconut lovers. But no.. the eatery specialises in the humble nasi lemak (coconut rice).\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />Light, fluffy and fragrant rice that was cooked in hand-squeezed young coconut milk. Deep fried crispy chicken leg with lemongrass shreds. The homemade sambal with bits of onions was spicy and had a tinge of tamarind.\n<br />üîπüî∏\n<br />The rice had a little velvety shine to it. Cooked in a way where the coconut does not seem overpowering. Fried chicken lovers, this is crispy and moist with a tinge of crunchy lemony aftertones.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />However, this plate of nasi lemak comes at a slightly hefty price of $12.80. Almost every component is handmade to maintain the very old school flavors. If you are around the area, just pop in and give it a try. Service is very good. I felt I was given a little more better attention than others. Thank you all of you at @thecoconutclubsg .. truly had a good time there.
I can\'t resist anything gula Melaka so after seeing every table have at least one bowl, I caved üòÇBOY THIS IS SO GOOD!
