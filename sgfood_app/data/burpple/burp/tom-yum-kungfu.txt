yesterday\'s #thaifood for #lunch. i think this photo is crap. but oh wells, Green Curry set lunch, $7.90ea. 1 drink inclusive, dont get the lemongrass, it\'s like syrup+water, i think their water chestnut and thai #milktea is better. #curry #popiah
Wished they were more generous with the food portions. Nonetheless, this is quite a nice place to hang out with a small group of friends. :)
Not that kind of punchy spicy and sourish Tom yum but it\'s not too bad. Comes with a side dish and drink at $7.90.

Fav mookata place! Reasonable price 👍🏼
I\'m glad they improved to be better, I saw some pieces of corns inside the soup, a nice touch to it and they added chicken in their set which taste very good too! Will always be my favorite! #foodie #foodstagram #dinner #yummy #thai #food #burpple #instafood
yummy :)
Mookata. And what\'s better than tom yam soup on it\'s own? Mookata with tomyam soup base ! Our only gripe was the soup was abit too salty. We had to add our own tom yam paste to the normal soup base so the paste probably had too much salt in it. If we added just a teeny bit then how tom yam will the soup be? It will be better if they had the tom yam soup already prepared for us separately. We got to select tom yam soup base for free though so that\'s still understandable ! #mookata #steamboat #barbecued #tomyamsoup #tomyam #meat #meatlovers #pork #scallops #veggies #tomyamkungfu #thaifood #fridaynight #tgif #whati8today #dinner #delicious #foodporn #foodstagram #sgfood #foodies #fooddiary #food #sgfoodies #burpple #eatoutsg #instalike #instafollow #instafood #instafoodsg
Still my first choice when come for thai food BBQ.
Have been craving for mookata and a perfect way to end the week on a Friday night. We ordered the set for 39.90 for 2-3 pax which comes with marinated pork, chicken, scallops, prawn, fish cake, vege and glass noodle. Also ordered deep fried prawn cake, another popular dish from their ala carte menu, which was huge, succulent and absolutely yummy. Do try the Thai ice tea too, tastes just like the ones you get in Thailand and a great thirst quencher. Overall damage $70 for 3 pax, very value for money I would say. 😬
