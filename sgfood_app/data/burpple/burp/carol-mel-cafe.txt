While we didn\'t get to jump on the #unicornfrappuccino bandwagon, we have our talented barista @damien_tc creating awesome #latteart over @carol_mel_cafe!
The moment I saw the strikingly beautiful sakura matcha latte art created by @damien_tc on @cliffton_jt\'s IG, I jumped in a cab and zipped over to Carol Mel Cafe. \n<br />It was fascinating to watch Damien \"draw\" the sakura. Clearly, an artistic eye and steady hands are a must. And as perfect as the deep green matcha was as a background for the cherry blossoms, its strong (yet not bitter) taste was equally pleasing.
This was served alongside with sweet &amp; very mild Japanese curry, as well as our usual maple syrup. Overall a very quaint cafe with minimalistic interior &amp; cozy relaxing atmosphere - great go-to hideout spot for quality chill with your gang over grub anytime of the day. Happy Sunday guys!
Filled with real Mao Shan Wang durian flesh, this durian creme brûlée is set to redefine your perception of a creme brulee! Silken smooth with a thin layer of caramel coating the top!\n<br />❣️\n<br />Get your Monday bloos cure for $8.50 a piece, $35 for 5 and $65 for 10!\n<br />❣️\n<br />Thanks to the friendly folks for this sweet treat 😘 @damien_tc, @cliffton_jt ! You all know how to make zeh zeh happy! 🤣
The waffle here is delightfully crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. A playful texture of the gooey banana, grilled marshmallow, zesty summer berries, chocolate gelato and maple syrup made this really a pleasure to enjoy! The waffle here is a must try!
Pretty, colorful and sedap! When there, try the zhi char salted egg luncheon fries and say hi to foodie friends. Haha. #tingzieeats #burpple
This is fragrant too and not too sweet! Something that\'s both visually satisfying and tastes awesome! #burpple #tingzieeats
_\n<br />Instead of the typical salted egg sauce on food, @carol_mel_cafe \'s version (priced at $12) is prepared in the local zhi-char style (aka home-cooked) so the luncheon fries is evenly coated with the salted egg yolk, which feels like a batter paste. Every slice gives a sinful yet comforting satisfaction!
The colors come from the pea flower. There are a few ways to drink them too: just the tea on top, mixing it with the syrup and lastly, adding acidity to the drink with the lemon. Highly recommended. #burpple #tingzieeats
One of the best dish to conquer spore heat! Cold springy pasta topped with succulent fresh mussels, ikura, prawns and salmon! Lightly flavored and addictive that kept you slurping down for more!
Make the day better with coffee done with cute latte art!\n<br />Thanks to @damien__tc for these cute meow &amp; oink!
So glad to have tried the new menu at this hidden gem (they used to sell ipoh-inspired dishes). Yummy at affordable price and not crowded (yet)!\n<br />_\n<br />Framed, recommended by online reviews:\n<br />Salted egg luncheon fries - $12\n<br />Razuken seafood cold pasta - $18\n<br />French duck confit - $20\n<br />_
Suprisingly the laksa pasta is quite nice, suitable for people who don\'t eat spicy food and their Salted Egg yolk luncheon fries is not that salty. Total damage for 4 items at $45. The food took sometime to arrive.. If you are rushing for time, this place may not for you. Otherwise, it\'s still good.
And I was pleasantly surprised that a little drizzle (not too much) of the maple syrup does go well with the chicken wings. If you like honey BBQ wings, you should give this a try.\n<br />🍖\n<br />For those who dislike sweet stuff, not to worry because the maple syrup is served separately. On their own, the chicken wings are delicious too, not overly seasoned like some places and not too bland either. Price is a little on the high side though.\n<br />🍖\n<br />Carol Mel Cafe\n<br />1 Irving Place, The Commerze@Irving, 01-30, S369546\n<br />Mon to Fri: 12pm to 9pm\n<br />Sat: 11am to 9pm\n<br />Sun: 11am to 4pm\n<br />+65 6635 5755\n<br />🍖\n<br />#freewifisg available
It\'s hardly revolutionary, just spam fries and salted egg. But it\'s so addictive!\n<br />🍟\n<br />While both luncheon meat and salted egg are saltish, @carol_mel_cafe has somehow managed to balance the flavors so that the dish is neither too salty nor too sweet. One of the better executed salted egg dishes in my opinion.\n<br />🍟\n<br />Carol Mel Cafe\n<br />1 Irving Place, The Commerze@Irving, 01-30, S369546\n<br />Mon to Fri: 12pm to 9pm\n<br />Sat: 11am to 9pm\n<br />Sun: 11am to 4pm\n<br />+65 6635 5755\n<br />🍟\n<br />#freewifisg available

Very well executed. Before anyone could say, \"another salted egg dish?\", I must first applaud them for making this seemingly sinful and heavy dish light and addictive.\n<br />🔸\n<br />There wasn\'t double dosage of sodium being luncheon + salted egg, it was surprisingly not very salty. The batter was also really crispy. I hope no one else noticed that I was already stealing some of these while everyone was still busy shooting it.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
That lamb shank was a whopping 450g, and together with the aglio olio, it has to be shared. After all food tastes better that way isn\'t it?\n<br />🔸\n<br />The highlight of this dish is how tender the lamb shank is through hours of slow braising in red wine sauce. If you don\'t mind a bit of gamey mutton taste, you might like this, which is also their signature dish.
A quiet cafe on a weekday evening, Cafe Carol Mel is tucked away from public eye, although it\'s near to Tai Seng MRT.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I love these wings - juicy moist flesh with crispy, crumbly skin. I had it without maple and it was already good, but feel free to drizzle the maple over for an added dimension to enhance its taste. It\'s only $9 without service charge and GST.\n<br />🔸
If you love your waffles crispy, this is one of the best around.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Waffles served hot with ice cream cold, it was a party of temperature and texture contrast due to the whimsical toppings of banana, melted sharp cheddar cheese, caramel gelato, grilled marshmellows, fresh summer berries, maple syrup and salted caramel sauce.
Crispy buttermilk waffle loaded with banana, grilled marshmallow, fresh summer berries, salted caramel gelato, and drizzled with maple syrup and salted caramel sauce. I am really surprised at how well the waffle can still retain its crisp even after some time!\n<br />🔅\n<br />Thank you @carol_mel_cafe for the awesome meal and @damien_tc for the invitation 😻.\n<br />🔅\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋 Carol Mel Cafe\n<br />💰$16\n<br />🍴The Commerze at Irving #01-03, 1 Irving Place Singapore 369546\n<br />⏲Opening Hours: Mon to Fri 12PM-9PM, Sat 11AM-9PM, Sun 11AM-4PM\n<br />☎️Tel: +65 6635 5755

It\'s certified. Fried winglets with a slightly crisp, seasoned outside and juicy within, drizzled with maple sauce is my thing. Whoever thought of this savoury sweet combination is a genius. And this place, does it all the justice. 💫\n<br />Great food here tonight with fun banter. Totally brightens up a weeknight
It really surprised me how this combination works out.
Apologies for the rusty &amp; messy pour. \n<br />It\'s been too long since i make coffee 😂😂😂 I\'m still searching for a part- time or full-time Barista job. \n<br />Do drop me a text if there are any opportunities. \n<br />Thanks. 😆😆😆
Signature Whimsical - $16.00\n<br />A pleasurable combination of the sweet (ice cream, marshmallow, banana, caramel), sour (strawberry, blueberry) and savoury (waffle, cheese). It is not just delightful; you\'ll want to come back for more!
The whimsical waffle has got to be the best waffle we\'ve ever had. A good waffle and great combination of toppings. $16. Brunch menu items are really good too!
Randomly stumble upon this cafe nearby Tai Seng mrt. Decided to try their crispy buttermilk waffle with 2 scoops of ice cream, salted caramel and hazelnut. It does indeed live up to its name. The waffle is very crispy on the outside but manage to stay fluffy and light in the inside. 
Because you get the fun of \"digging for treasure\" lol! The mascarpone cream came with a smooth, melt-in-the-mouth texture. Totally in love with the spongy and airy chiffon-like mascarpone fingers. \n<br />Overall : A great chill out place in tai seng. It has a lot of interesting menu items which are both promising and definitely delivers a \"wow\" factor to your palate.
Food orgasm with 450g lamb shank braised in red wine jus! How good can it get! Tender and easily detach from the bone! And it\'s like 99% meat, 1% fats! Perfectly flavored both the lamb shank and the salad. Burst of refreshing-ness from the salad amidst mouthful of savory with hints of sweetness from the lamb shank! Pasta is alittle disappointing though, lacking the flavor in place. Good for sharing! It will be a little too overwhelming if you intend to conquer it solo. 
A 450gm Lamb Shank that was slow braised to perfection. The meat was so tender and soft, served together with the red wine sauce that truly brought out the flavour of the lamb. This dish is a sure winner for big meat eaters or even for 2 ladies to share! \n<br />I would totally get this to share with my girlfriend and order more desserts to complete the Carol Mel experience 😉

An interesting way of serving the soup as the toast had totally soaked up the flavours of the french onion soup, topped with melted sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese ($12). 😋\n<br />#EatWithKu #🌚 #🍴 #carolmelcafe #soups
PRICE: $9nett for a waffle with 1 scoop of gelato and maple syrup
@ Carol Mel Cafe.
Hit all the right notes of colour, taste and texture. 
Waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, awesome. Comes with belgium chocolate Gelato,  semi-dark chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, crunchy almond flakes, double chocolate chip biscotti, marshmallows and fruits. Super good, super pleasing to the eyes. Didn\'t expect such goodness from an unassuming cafe.
Pleasantly surprised by the crisp and light buttermilk waffle, made perfect with a scoop of vanilla gelato
Another 3 weeks old cafe in Tai Seng! Looks like Tai Seng is opening up more and more cafes! This lychee martini has a strong distinctive lychee taste in the whipped cream frosting above and between the layers. However the sponge cake layer is a bit on the dry side.

In those days, his repertoire of latteart was rosettas, double rosettas, swans, hearts etc. ◾◾\n<br />But now his repertoire is more extensive, time consuming, abit more complex but yet showcasing the fun and lighter side. The coffee, at first sip, was mellow. Followed by a few more sips, it leaves a nutty chocolaty, tinge of gentle bitterness with a tad creamy finish. ◾◾\n<br />I ordered my latte with no special requests made because during a busy time, a rosetta or a heart on my coffee will suffice. For me, it is the taste that mattered. The art is an added bonus.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />As I begin to shoot, my mind tells me go simple. No props, no handmodels, no fancy mancy decor.  Just the cup of coffee on a black table. This is my way of showing respect and appreciation for the barista and his work. Thank you Damien!

No amount of seasoning or flavouring can ever replicate this. \n<br />Whisk all these together in the tangy yuzu wasabi soy and relish the scrumptious dish after.\n<br />This is a special dish that is not on the regular menu but it is undeniably the most popular item. \n<br />Try it before its gone!
*\n<br />Friends around Tai Seng, do drop by and say hi🖐\n<br />*\n<br />See you all soon 😆\n<br />*
.\n<br />This is bound to get us hook just by the name itself. Think Western style laksa. Here you get spaghetti served in laksa sauce with shrimps, fishcakes and sprinkles of crispy tau pok. Certainly something unique to look forward to.

Crispy, light n fluffy inside. We requested to omit the cheese which we felt the belgian waffle is nice as is. Generous toppings of bananas and berries which 3 of us loved loved loved😄 #waffles #dessertlovers #dessert #i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #hungrygowhere #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igsg #igers #tripadvisor #carolmel #instameetsg #instafollow

This dangling position is my favourite as it makes the dish looks like it\'s floating at the edge of the table.
Throwback to yesterday dinner tasting @carol_mel_cafe \n<br />Nice meeting new friends/tasting buddy
Chef Andy demonstrating how he prepares his Fusion Mushrooms Soup! 🍄🍄🍄 A hosted meal by @carol_mel_cafe.  Thanks!

Light, crispy with a hint of saltiness Waffle. With awesome topping. \n<br />Unfortunately this Waffle is taken off the menu. So if you like this, I am starting a campaign  so the owner will keep this in the menu #savewhimsical
Forgettable. But I\'ll be back for the desserts. :)
Most times it is not about good food or beautiful latteart, it is about bonding over friendship😄 #coffeelovers #coffeetime #coffeeaddict #latteart #friendsovercoffee #anotherdayanothercoffee #allthingscoffee #burpple #openricesg @damien_tc @gabrielimkopi
Warm crispy; not dense or doughy😋😋 shared with friends👬 #waffles #berries #whati8today #burpple #openricesg @carolmel  #eatbooksg\n<br />Thank you @damien_tc @gabrielimkopi for the food journey
Good combi. The flavors complemented each other. #scrambledeggs #toast #salads #burpple #openricesg
Nowadays it is difficult to find cakes prepared inhouse. I would go to such quaint cafes to get my homebaked🏠 cravings. 😄 #chocolatelovers #chocolate #dessertlovers #sgfoodie #burpple #openricesg @carol_mel_cafe\n<br />Nearest mrt : tai seng
