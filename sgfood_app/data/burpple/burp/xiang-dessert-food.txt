Apart from serving authentic Taiwanese snow ice dessert and snacks, Xiang Hao Chi [饗好吃] situated in Upper Thomson now serve Taiwanese local delicacies too! I highly recommend ordering the Popcorn Chicken &amp; Mee Sua with grilled pig\'s intestine. Thank you for the invite.
Now you can add one more to your list as there is also a Taiwanese bistro that serves Taiwanese savoury food such as Mee Sua ($6.80), Herbal Chicken Soup ($10.90) and Braised Pork Rice ($6.80). Besides the mains, they also serve their popular milk snow ice, that has been specially imported from Taiwan and comes topped with options such as strawberries, mangoes or durian.
A classic Taiwanese dish that had me slurping it up with unbridled enthusiasm. Seemingly humble in appearance, I found this bowl of very soft \"mee sua\" in gravy that came with pig\'s intestine and crunchy pieces of deepfried pork fillet most gratifying. Especially after loading it with black vinegar and the fragrant chilli paste. 真的好吃！ \n<br />Thank you for being such a generous host today @xianghaochi. And thanks @spadely for inviting me to the tasting session.\n
Very tasty and satisfying Taiwanese Crispy Pork Cutlet Rice. Pork cutlet came out looking somewhat dull &amp; dry. But oh boy was I in for a surprise! It turns out to be very tender! Some parts with the fats were so tasty (yes, and sinful too). The side dishes of pickled cabbage &amp; cucumber were good &amp; complement the main dish very well. Rice was drizzled with some braised pork sauce (卤肉饭) which certainly up the taste and value. Finally topped with a whole egg that was cooked soft inside (think egg in ramen). A really satisfying meal for $8.80.
Cold desert with sweet lychees and pudding, with soft shaved ice. Bound to cool down even the hottest heads.
Cute presentation which will delight the inner child, while the taste of the pudding and soil-looking crumbs ups the sugar rush in that same inner child.
Value for money set lunch with dessert.
Full meat lovers rice bowl. The sauce is tasty.
A happy all-in-one Taiwanese delights to satisfy my stomach. \n<br />Other than these that were pretty decent, their snow ice desserts were also good to end the meal with. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #braised

Interesting having tender pork belly with tangy chilli sauce and garlicky kimchi.
