Ice cream is always a good idea. Creamier is always a good idea.
The waffles here are pretty good. Slightly crisp outside, fluffy soft inside, airy yet with good flavour.
An ode to the local favourite breakfast of Kaya Toast — pretty much like the real deal where you get an evident coconut-y, Pandan flavour amidst the creamy, smooth ice-cream with chunks replicating bread in terms of texture.
The waffles here - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - totally my cup of tea ;D Interesting flavours of icecream that\'s really milky and not too sweet - Thai Milk Tea and Pistachio! Heard that it\'s abit pricier here than at Toa Payoh but not too sure. Will definitely visit again! ;p
Creamier at Gillman Barracks, more spacious though less accessible. No longer will you have to squeeze into the small space at Toa Payoh Branch and feel stress while eating and others standing.
Wanted to try the Thai Milktea flavour but hearsay honey lemon alleviates sore throats. And yes, the tangy sorbet did do its job in soothing my throat! The highly-raved waffles lived up to its reputation of being crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside, but I guess sorbets dont go as well with waffles as icecreams do.
Still the best pistachio icecream and waffles in town. Love the vibes in this outlet
My favourite PBJ wasn\'t available, so I went for the local-inspired Kaya Toast that seriously tasted like the real deal.
Thankful to have a partner who always makes sure I rest and eat my desserts 😂, because balance is key to life.\n<br />.\n<br />Black forest ice cream and pomegranate yogurt ice cream on the best waffles ever.
The light waffle &amp; roasted pistachio icecream never fails 👍🏻
Unique ice cream and the waffles are divine!! Earl grey lavender was goood. Crispy outside and soft in the inside. Good service! They served me wrong scoop of ice cream and gave me one as complimentary! Ended up having 3 scoops 😂😂 so satisfied!!
$8.80 for pancakes and a scoop of ice cream; we got earl grey lavender! Waffles was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Went rly well with the ice cream and chocolate sauce and maple syrup surrounding the waffles. For an additional scoop, just top up $2.80. (Saw many people getting three scoops 😧 but I approve 👍🏼) OH, I gotta mention that their service was rly good too!
☺ Lunch with vegetarian friends who happen to work very near my office. Interesting right we had waffles and icecream for lunch. Hahas. (We had some yummy rice rolls while walking to here.) Surprised to find out only now that creamier got this another outlet here, btw their staffs are busy but still nice. Keep it up! This made me miss real belgium waffles. #sgfood #burpple #vegetarian #icecreamwaffle #lunch #igsg
Ordered butterscrotch almond icecream waffles.. The icecream is smooth and not overly sweet. Matched well with the crispy waffle. Total $9.70.
Had the roasted pistachio and macadamia tropicana which were both good. Service could be better though. And they should invest in more waffle irons since a lot of people come for their waffles. We had to wait quite long for ours.
So excited to try Creamier after 4 years of knowing and waiting! The waffles were definitely on-point with crispy exterior and light fluffy texture inside. They have interesting ice cream flavours but we still stick to the safer ones 
Waffles and 2 scoops of ice cream $11.80. 2 flavours - Earl Grey and plain ole chocolate. Prefer this branch as its more peaceful
Be naughty and order this hard-hitting and unmistakably adult concoction (they say it\'s a splash, I say it\'s a tsunami), and mentally laugh like Nelson from The Simpsons at the young children and their families for only having decidedly tame and babyish ice cream balls atop waffles while you\'re all grown up, hipster and sophisticated, etc.
A tranquil post-work post-dinner walk amidst the tropical humid Gillman Barracks, we find ourselves in front of Block 5A craving for some ice-cream! We walked in and ordered waffles with ice-creams - Earl Grey Lavender, Kaya Toast, and Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly! Compared to Sunday Folks, the ice-cream here is somewhat more toward a traditional example of waffles and ice-cream. But of course, I thought the earl grey lavender tastes better than Sunday Folks (they are under the same group) for its lighter, less tangy aroma! Some say this is probably the best waffle ice-cream in Singapore!
Her favorite mix with my favorite. When both mix each other, it blend well like our relationship goes well each day. Having it in a very hot weather and the ice cream melted fast. Overall ah, 3.5/5 
Had their waffles with earl grey lavender and kaya toast ice cream. \n<br />And now I can totally understand why people always queued up for this last time at the Toa Payoh outlet (or is there still a queue now?)
Post-exam treat! We got waffles with Earl Grey Lavendar, Roasted Pistachio and Salted Gula Melaka and all three tasted equally great! The salted gula melaka was a beautiful balance between sweet and savoury, the earl grey lavendar (personally my favourite) a fragrant symphony and the roasted pistachio had very strong notes of the nut. Very very good first experience with waffles and ice-cream that would be hard to top off! Waffles with one scoop costs $8.80 and every additional scoop is $2.80. 
I can so see myself here every week.\n<br />And when they say the world is small, it is real. Fancy bumping into familiar faces here.
Finally ventured to the latest addition in Gillman Barracks. Love their kaya ice cream but waffles was quite off that day. However, I think I will be back again cos I am missing the kaya ice cream 😍😍😍 it is not in frame cos I dropped it onto the floor 😭😭😭
Back again to Creamier within 4 days. This time the waffles were a bit hard. Anyhow, all is forgiven - chanced upon the green tea ice cream and had to try it, and it\'s super yum. Goes really well with the waffles and it\'s my favourite flavour at Creamier (for now). Matcha lovers will love it. 
Waffles with earl grey lavender and chocolate ice cream. If the batter isn\'t done right, then the waffles should not be sold to customers, who are armed with high hopes of getting to their happy place. The disappointment is usually too much to handle, and people end up not wanting to go back to the same place. For a first try of this popular establishment, I\'ll be going back to Creamier and that\'s for sure! 
Finally tried Creamier! And the highly rare (in both first branch and the sister café Sunday Folks), awesome bonus point is that it was really quiet when I visited, so I could sit and enjoy my crisp fluffy waffle and coffee.
Just one week old baby here.\n<br />No longer have to travel far for good waffles when i have one nearby. Sister company of @wearesunday and they have a wider variety of ice cream. We chose earlgrey lavender and seasalt gula melaka.\n<br />Wish they could have more tables though. Already flooded with people in here.
At Creamier\'s second outlet, 10 out of their 18 signature flavours are now permanently on the menu (the rest are on rotational basis) — that is reason enough to travel down to Gillman Barracks for dessert! The bigger and better Creamier also boasts more indoor seating than its Toa Payoh outlet and two new ice cream flavours — Macadamia Tropicana ($4.20) and Pomegranate Yoghurt ($4.20). First time here? Go for their signature ice cream flavour Sea Salt Gula Melaka ($3.30). If it\'s available, add on a scoop of the Peanut Butter and Jelly ($4.20) — it\'s a winning combination of savoury and sweet. Don\'t miss out on their fluffy waffles too ($6 for waffles alone, $8.80 with one scoop of ice cream)! 
.\n<br />With a more laid-back environment and slightly spacious interior, one can also expect two latest addition of ice cream flavours to match with waffles.\n<br />.\n<br />Macadamia Tropicana - blend of nutty fragrance and milky coconut with a refreshing hint of pineapple.\n<br />.\n<br />Pomegranate Yogurt - thick and creamy frozen yogurt with occasional bits of pomegranate.
This institution needs no introduction, but their new outlet\'s the perfect excuse for a dose of the bestest waffles in town! We topped ours with their three foolproof ice cream flavours: Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly, Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Roasted Pistachio. 
7 Jan’18, Sun\n<br />Waffle with Hazelnut Milk Chocolate and Summer Strawberries Ice Cream at Creamier (Gillman Barracks)...
Puuurrrrfect for a cold weekend afternoon! #wew @creamier_sg
Using the app #flok, there is a loyalty programme for creamier which allowed me to get 1-1 ice cream ☺️. Promos are always good 👍🏼\n<br />📍@creamer_sg, Gillman Barracks, 5A Lock Road, S10892

Double stacked crispy and fluffy waffles with premium artisan ice cream. Easy parking with ample seating. You would be surprised by the crowd that actually makes the effort to come to this \"ulu\" part of Singapore!
😋👍🏻
Perhaps Creamier staffs know it\'s a good cause for celebration, look at the generous scoop of Salted Caramel Gula Melaka and Pistachio ice cream!
😐
Made with milky white chocolate and organic shiro miso from Nagano, it is a happy marriage of sweet and savoury. The Seaweed topping added a nice salty finishing touch to the unique flavour.\n<br />Our other favourite had to be the Kaya Toast which was such an authentic local flavour that was good with the waffles and on its own. #burrple  #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #waffles #creamier

Played with @eatandtreats camera and it was so awesome!
We totally skipped our workout and went for ice cream instead. No queue no crowd and almost nobody. What a nice way to end an entire day of non stop work. It was a nice break though. My body was aching top to bottom. I probably needed the rest. Thanks for insisting we take a rest day 😊. Ice cream wise, we got a scoop of pistachio and a scoop of holicks chocolate chip. Both were really good. The pistachio flavour was strong and had enough nuts in it, making it a winner at first bite (quoted from him 😁). The chocolate chip in the holicks ice cream made it unique from other holicks ice cream, and the chocolate chips really complemented the holicks flavour well. As for the waffle, it was crisp and delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. \n<br />#sgfoodie #sgcafes #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #cafelife #icecream #belgiumwaffle #waffleicecream #burpple #dessert #sweettooth #instafood_sg #eatoutsg

The Short Review
Finally no need to travel to TPY. @creamier_sg @gillmanbarracks is nearer to me! #creamiersg #gillmanbarracks #sgwaffles #burpple #burpplesg #waffleswithicecream
Thanks for the great cuppa @weelistic!
The saving grace that day had to be the ice-cream! Finally tried the black sesame 😍
Love the ice cream at @creamier_sg 😍
hazelnut praline, macadamia tropicana &amp; almond butterscotch mmm
The waffles were soo good. Nice ambience and nice place. Not too many people too which is a huge plus as we could just sit there and chill after enjoying our sweet treat.
The ice-cream here is so good, 💕 the peanut butter &amp; jelly flavour best and the kaya toast was quirky with the distinctive pandan flavour ❤️\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #bestoftheday #comfortfood #creamier #creamiersg #delicious #dessertporn #desserts #dessertoftheday #eatoutsg #foodporn #foodstagramsg #foodgasm #igsg #instadaily #instagramhub #instayum #igers #icecream #nomnnomnom #onthetable #picoftheday #sgfg #sgfood #sgeats #tslmakan #waffles #waffleicecream #vscosg
They have a new branch at Gillman Barracks! \n<br />Pistachio ice-cream was sooooooooo flavourful with the fragrance of the nut. The waffles were crispy and goes really well with the honey and chocolate sauce. \n<br />If you want to try Creamier without queuing up at the bustling main branch, try your luck here during weekdays! \n<br />#vscocam #vscofood #instafood #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #sgfood #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehopping #creamier #icecream #dessert #dessertsg #sgdessert #waffles #pistachio #pistachioicecream #gillmanbarracks #igsg #sgig #burpple #singapore
Nothing beats roasted pistachio ice cream on waffles!
Combi of Cookies and cream, Rasberry Love, and Peanut Butter &amp; jelly! So great!!! 😄😋
A lovely place to chill out on a hot Saturday afternoon.
