My favourite 流沙包!! I have finally satisfied my craving. Love it so much!! Do be careful when you eat, as the juice might oozed out. 
Somewhat like har gau (shrimp dumpling), slightly stronger in taste. The 3 different colour doesn\'t seem to have much different in taste. It could be me though. 
Mango and century egg in glass roll with wasabi sauce. Awesome taste. Can be a little spicy for those who don\'t take spicy food. 
Durian mochi. Super soft and so much durian 😍. #iwantmore #howtorun10k #examswhatexams
Definitely my Top 5 Xiao Long Bao in Singapore. Though a relatively quiet restaurant in an impossibly crowded Vivocity. #instavideo
The flowing Liu Sha Bao. I am out to find the best of Singapore to write an entry, am already done with 9 places (of which will narrow to 5). Readers recommended this last one, I braved the crazy crowd of Vivocity to order these custard buns. They are right! The oozing is epic!
Yummy chilli crab... Just not used to eating it on a tart.
Awesome 流沙包, just one bite is enough to let the salted egg yolk splash all over!
Guess what bao?
Xiao long bao :)
Honey grilled pork ribs are so tempting. Fatty but not too fat.
Deep Fried Oyster Chee Cheong Fun. Our \'boss\' likes oysters. He smiled when it arrived.
Siew Mai with big prawn on the top. The mafia boss wants it that way. Haha.
Nice soft buns that jiggle and have yummy salted egg yolk 流沙!! Nice savory flavor not too sweet. Have it while it’s hot but be careful it might burn!!! comes in 3 but can get however many you like (not just in multiples of 3) #drklingeats #burpple #blacksociety #流沙包

Have been hearing so much about this place but was disappointed.\n<br />The duck was a little dry, the spinach beancurd was average. 
Still one of my favourite XO carrot cake
Juicy and fragrant
Huge bowl / good for sharing
Quite chio, hor? Ok, that\'s all.
Used to be a regular here but food standards have dropped drastically\n<br />.\n<br />Prawns were mushy, skin was thick and the baos shrunk 😨😵\n<br />.\n<br />Waste of calories and money. Never going back again. 😖😓😝\n<br />.\n<br />#bossesrestaurant #vivocity #dimsum\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #sgeats #foodpornsg #foodstagram #igfood #igsg #sgigfoodies #openricesg\n<br />#burpple #8dayseatout #instafood #instadaily #vscocam #vscofood #dissappointing #wasteofmoney

Value for money during lunch time 
The Signature Custard Lava Bun is really lava-ish! The Mango Fried Shrimp and Scallop Yam Nest is awesome too!! 老人家 hope you liked it! #黑社会 #bossesvivocity #dimsum #brunch #birthday #birthdayboy #superfull #surprisesunday #chinesecuisine
One of my favourite dimsum restaurant - Bosses. They serve darn good dimsum. This plate of fried prawn dumpling (fried har gow), super shiok! A must try!
Fish skin as appetizer
