:\n<br />It\'s clear to see why this dish is a megastar once I sliced through the patty... underneath that crisp brown shell are generous shreds of blue swimmer crab meat, very much like opening up the real deal. Even though our host Prashant said that they\'ve toned down the spiciness of the sauce to suit non-local tastes, it is thankfully still hot enough to be more than passable by chilli crab standards. You can choose to have this burger with shoestring fries or mesclun side salad for $25.\n<br />:\n<br />The newer items of the menu include the beer battered dory topped with yummy tomato and onion relish ($15), Sakura ebi aglio olio ($22), and the Big Breakfast ($22) for you all-day brunch lovers - it comes with fried kale chips and pommes noisette/fried potato puffs!\n<br />:\n<br />Another new item is the Ondeh Ondeh hotcake - the bright green gelato scoop looks suspiciously alien, but rest assured it\'s edible and pandan-coconut flavoured. It could do with more gula melaka sauce so that it\'s easier to swallow the fluffy but slightly dry pandan hotcake (at the time of the tasting, seems like they have adjusted the recipe from more recent reviews).\n<br />:\n<br />If in doubt, there\'s always their popular BRB Hotcake, a garden of strawberries, blackberries and raspberry strewn on a thick spongey blueberry ricotta hotcake. This is a filling dessert that has your tastebuds dancing from the tart berries then calmed by the cool creamy vanilla ice cream.\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks Prashant from @artistrycafesg for hosting, and @burpple for the invite! #Burpple
Really enjoyed the harmonious combination of the various elements here - fresh and crunchy tiger prawns, strips of goma kombu, crispy rich sakura shrimps, all with a slight garlicky based al dente spaghetti plus a tinge of heat. Easily a very likeable dish! 
A lovely dessert for sharing to end your meal! The thick yet fluffy blueberries and ricotta hotcake is served warm with crisp edges around and topped with a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, crunchy toasted sunflower seeds, fresh fruits and maple syrup. Looks simple but it has quality, done very well with the combination of textures and flavours!
A twist on the popular Artistry BRB Hotcake, this local fusion take had potential but we thought it kinda needed a few tweaks. The warm pandan hotcake was done well with slight crisps all around, topped with a big scoop of pandan coconut gelato, gula melaka syrup, toasted coconut and coconut ricotta creme. Thought the pandan flavours didn‚Äôt come out as strong as we hoped for and perhaps, a more generous drizzle of gula melaka can help to bring it together better. My vote still goes to the BRB Hotcake!
The all time favourite and signature burger here at Artistry, I FINALLY got to try it and okay yes, I get the hype. Just look at that mad thick patty that‚Äôs filled crazy generously with handpicked blue swimmer crabmeat! The patty‚Äôs sandwiched between soft toasted sundried tomato brioche buns and you can pick either shoestring fries or mesclun greens as the side. The cup of housemade chilli crab sauce was authentic and rich with a good amount of heat. So addictive that we ended up dipping all our fries and burger buns in it too!
When Raymond was in town, can\'t help but to bring him to one of my favourite cafe. While they had revamped their menu, frequent diners will be glad to hear their Big Breakfast, signature Artistry Chilli Crab Burger and delicious PB&amp;J French Toast are still here.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Being a huge fan of ondeh ondeh, my eyes lighted up when I saw fellow Burpple TM @okwhotooknyusername post on the Ondeh Ondeh Hotcakes ($15). Slight crispy at the edges yet moist within, the Pandan hotcake dotted with coconut ricotta creme, topped with pandan coconut gelato. Sprinkled desiccated coconut and Gula melaka syrup to complete this dish. The latter was somewhat lacking and wish we had a small pot to pour more over.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Artistry Cafe\n<br />Address: 17 Jalan Pinang, Singapore 199149\n<br />#artistrycafe
After all those greasy burgers in Australia, this was a welcome change. The patty comprised a generous amount of crabmeat, and went refreshingly well with a spritz of lime and the greens. While I wish the patty had a more crispy exterior, the fries were fried very nicely- crispy and not greasy at all. We enjoyed it so much that an additional order of fries was placed!\n<br />I would probably try the other dishes the next time I visit, but wouldn\'t hesitate to order the Long Black again. While it may be way too acidic to some, it was dark and bold, just the way I like it. One of my favourite coffees in Singapore!
PBJ French Toast-Is it even possible to get a custardy stuffed french toast like this? Truly indulging 4.75/5
Chilli Crab Burger-one of the most well known dish here. The burger was good, add the chilli to it, So good 4/5
In case you are wondering, halloumi is actually an unripened brined cheese made form a mixture of goat and sheep\'s milk. Every element in this kaleidoscopic brunch platter was a satisfaction to my palate (apart from the tomatoes of course üòÖ). The grilled halloumi had a slightly crisp chargrilled exterior with a firm, rubbery interior and a piquant flavour that\'s rather similar to a thick feta cheese. Moving on, the scrambled eggs were done to perfection- creamy and smooth, silky texture with a milky, eggy fragrance! üíñ The fried kale chips were crisp and seaweed-like, adding a tinge of saltiness to the platter and was surprisingly additive and great üëçüèª The mini crossaint was toasted to a crisp, flaky exterior coupled with a pillowy interior that withheld a lingering buttery fragrance. In addition, the roasted mini portobellos were well saut√©ed with a distinctive  earthy note coupled with a chewy, juicy texture. Lastly, the pomme noisettes (deep fried potatoes) were crisp with a soft,  creamy mash interior that was also an addiction - wish there was more of it! üòã A fulfilling and satisfying brunch that was worth every $ spent and every calorie intake, coupled with a welcoming, friendly service from the crews here that made my trip worthwhile‚ò∫Ô∏è .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Usually not one that would order drinks at cafes (as I personally find it not worth), I was glad I did here - though it was for the sake of the latte art initially üòπ. The characteristic roasted flavour was surprisingly distinct, with a lingering roasted aroma coupled with a pleasant earthy note. Though not the best Houjicha latte - with my personal favourite still from Matchaya, this was not too bad for a cafe beverage (that does not specialize in teas). .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
Artistry\'s Big Breakfast Platter, now served with..\n<br />Fried Kale üíö\n<br />Not forgetting the usuals; creamy scrambles, spicy pork sausage, streaky bacon, roasted mushrooms, pommes noisette and a mini butter croissant. The epitome of what every happy child / hardworking employee / deserving parent should be served for breakfast. That\'s probably everyone. \n<br />Thankyou Prashant for graciously hosting us, and Burpple for the invitation x\n<br />22bucks/serve
A fistful of meat from the blue swimmer crab encrusted like a croquette, sandwiched between buttered Sundried Tomato brioche buns. Served with a side of either Mesclun Greens or Shoestring Fries and their punchy housemade chilli crab sauce. Expect some good heat from the sauce but it\'ll have you double dipping everything from your fries to crab patty and even your burger buns in them. \n<br />Thankyou Prashant for graciously hosting us and Burpple for the invite x\n<br />25bucks/serve
Got the opportunity to have a taste of Artistry\'s new menu that launches tomorrow for today\'s Burpple Tastemaker Eatup ‚Äî they have kept quite a number of the favourites on the menu such as the Chili Crab Burger, Big Breakfast and BRB Pancakes with slight tweaks to the recipe whilst introducing new items such as the Ondeh Ondeh Pancakes and Steak &amp; Eggs. 
The ondeh ondeh hotcake is of the new desserts in Artistry\'s reworked 2017 menu, which launches today. A perfectly round pandan hotcake is topped off with a generous scoop of pandan coconut gelato, a few artistic dabs of coconut ricotta creme, and a sprinkling of toasted coconut bits.
Springy Pandan hotcake, slightly crispy on the edges, served with a luminous green Pandan Coconut Gelato, Sticky Gula Melaka sauce, knobs of Coconut Ricotta Cream and specks of Desiccated Coconut. Every mouthful capturing the essence of the traditional Malay Kueh its named after. \n<br />Thankyou Prashant for graciously hosting us and Burpple for the invitation x\n<br />15bucks/serve
This fused concept of our iconic green kueh and western hotcake was not as breath taking as the chilli crab burger.\n<br />An unbiased consultation with local experts of ondeh ondeh may be beneficial- to twerk this sweet item but till then I\'ll stick with the BR pancakes. \n<br />The other two items (Prawn Aglio Olio, Beer Batter Fish Burger) were on the other hand decently executed- fuss free options once you\'ve tried the signature items and are looking for alternatives.
If you\'d allow me to be seen as a pancake aficionado; this was a no brainer classic combination of berries (raspberries, strawberries, blackberries) and vanilla ice cream on a hot off the pan-pancake with ricotta nuggets. 
It\'s been forever since I\'ve had Artistry\'s fabled chili crab burger ($25). Come to think of it, the last time I had it was during @veronicaphua\'s Tasty Tastemaker Tour (!). And just like fine wine and yours truly, this burger gets better with age.
Always a risk when you try to fuse 2 concept from different cuisines together- but the above was worth the bet. \n<br />Named Artistry\'s (signature) Chilli Crab Burger for a reason- the western concept of burger and fries is a hit with our local Chilli crab sauce. 
Another favourite of mine, a signature from Artistry, is its  Chilli Crab Burger (S$25++).
Start the day right with Artistry\'s Big Breakfast ($22). A yuuuuuge plate fully loaded with addictive deep fried potato balls, a beautiful, buttery and fantastically flaky croissant, crispy kale, a superb spicy sausage, two rashers of bacon and eggs done your way (pro tip: get their stellar scrambled eggs that are irresistibly rich &amp; silky). 
A big breakfast and sweet menu item seem to me a right formula for a good brunch (2pax). \n<br />Having outsource their bread produce from a reliable bakery supplier- the mini croissant complements the indulgent big breakfast. Good runny scramble, sausage &amp; bacon, roasted mushrooms, pommes noisette(hash) and deep fried kale.
For a protein loaded meal- steak and eggs is the answer. \n<br />Artistry improves upon an otherwise banal Angus beef striploin by serving it pink- as it is more pleasant to the palate. \n<br />The smashed Japanese pumpkin we all loved as well- to the point of recommending it as a stand alone side. Nothing should go direly wrong with the natural sweetness of the orange plant.
The Artistry Cafe has introduced a new menu today and it\'s great.
It\'s never happened but last week, I picked the healthiest item in Artistry\'s menu for breakfast üòÇ Which was this.\n<br />As the acai was served in a soft frozen state, it was more than ideal for the crazy hot weather. Also included was a bunch of other so-good-for-you stuff, like Greek yogurt, assorted berries, toasted sunflower seeds and coconut flakes (I really liked this!), making it quite the perfect healthy, refreshing and filling treat.\n<br />So, although Artistry launches a NEW MENU filled with loads of exciting items today, I\'m glad that this, along with a few of their popular signatures like the Chilli Crab Burger and BRB Hotcake, are still available. Whew! üòÑ
A place that has consistently served good cafe food and coffee, I can\'t wait to see what they will have. In meantime, let me enjoy their Duck Confit Beurre Noisette ($20) and PB&amp;J French Toast ($14)\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Love my @Danielwellington Classic Petite Melrose watch!

Came on Tues afternoon and enjoy a relaxing time here. Took flat white and my friend took mocha. Mine is alright but my friend has been complaining the mocha was a bit too sweet. For me, it\'s a bit too milky compare to normal mocha I have.
Everyone\'s got to try this!! The burger patty was graciously stuffed with crab meat to its max!!! üò≥Would like the patty to be slightly sweeter though. I dipped every item on my plate in the chilli crab sauce because ah ‚ù§Ô∏è it\'s just so yumz ü§§
$5 flat white, the coffee was good. Love the ambience of the place for a good afternoon hideaway
Despite the many openings throughout the years, we know we can still rely on Artistry, where food and coffee are both spot on. Indoor seating is limited, so swing by this cafe cum casual art gallery early to be seated in the comforts of air-conditioning, otherwise be prepared to sit outdoors. As always, our recommended eating plan is for a group of four to share two mains, so that you still have stomach space for dessert. You won\'t go wrong with the popular Artistry Chilli Crab Burger ($25) that sees a ridiculously generous patty of blue swimmer crab meat served with a heap of fries and a bowl of irresistible chilli crab sauce to dunk everything in. The crowd-pleasing Potato Hash and Scrambled Eggs ($20) that comes with silky scrambled eggs, surprisingly crisp kale and bacon, and little fried potato balls is another great option to share. If there\'s only one item your stomach has space for, let it be the PB&amp;J French Toast ($14). Expect a generous slather of smooth peanut butter smeared in between two pillowy slices of brioche, topped with vanilla bean ice cream, mixed berry coulis and a scattered bed of speculoos cookie soil. Wash it down with a cup of their excellent Flat White ($5) or Gibraltar ($5), a double shot of espresso with just a bit of milk.\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Marc T.
just normal pasta. was a bit oily\n<br />acai bowl is worse for me since has coconut milk taste inside
Crab patty is awesome. they giving a lot of crab meat but fries is normal.
Everything about this dish was amazing!! The chips were nicely seasoned, the bun was on point, like a man tou! Personally enjoyed the dish deconstructedüòÇLoved the sweet touch to their chilli crab sauceüëçüèº
The ratio of portobello to pasta was golden! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú® Seriously, there was as many chunks of mushroom as there were strands of linguine. Even a meat-lover like myself was infatuated. My teeth felt like they were were sinking into a piece of meat every time I bit into the juicy mushroom. FYI - the garlicky aglio olio wasn\'t too spicy, so it should suit most palates.
Wish I was sipping lattes in a cafe instead of being here. \n<br />Vanilla latte and bf\'s hazelnut latte. Quite good, but their coffee had some sort of laxative effect on me.
would usually go straight for the scrambled eggs but decided to try the one with kale instead and it reminded me of taokaenoi hahaha..... slightly too oily and salty :-( the chai latte was a tad bit too strong on the spices mmmm
This was Eggs on Toast ($15++), consisting of 2 eggs (choice of scrambled, over easy or sunny side up), sauteed baby spinach, portobello mushrooms (actually mushroom, cause there was only one) with multigrain toast. I was a little bummed that they do not do poached eggs üòû (why oh why), and there were only 2 half caps of portobello mushrooms. Overall quite an average brunch item, but then again how different can cafe brunches get üòÇ? Oh and the bf commented that their butter was weak and tasteless lol!
Wanted to try the BRB pancake but it was not available that day so tried the big breakfast instead. The food was not bad. 
Pop by @artistrycafesg the other day after class as I\'m craving for their PB&amp;J French Toast. We had their scrumptious Big Breakfast ($22), Artistry Chilli Crab Burger ($25), Squid Ink &amp; Slipper Lobster ($22).
-\n<br />Valrhona Chocolate Lava Cake ($14) with oozy gooey peanut butter. Let it flow... Let it flow...\n<br />-\n<br />#valrhona #moltenlavacake #peanutbutterchocolate
4.5 munchies: Sandwiched in two sun-dried tomato buns, the breaded crab cake is generously stuffed full of blue swimmer crab. Even though the crustacean was finely shredded, every mouthful had a good bite of it. The house-made chilli crab sauce served on the side was absolutely smashing ‚Äì spicy, sour with just a tinge of sweetness. It was perfect to go with the crab cake and for dunking the crispy shoestring fries in. If only they\'ve got some deep-fried man tous! #Burpproved
Lacking in the Unami department. Other Italian restaurants probably do a better job
Been yearning to meet this thing of beauty the first time we clapped eyes on fellow Tastemaker @veronicaphua\'s feed, and it was simply a glorious moment when we finally did.
PB&amp;J French Toast done beautifully. The french toast was moist and flavourful. The PB oozes out from within the bread, leaving you wanting more. The vanilla ice cream\'s a good match with this dish. Try it for yourself!
Handpicked Blue Swimmer Crab patty with a side of shoestring fries and their housemade Chilli crab sauce. üòã
where BRB stands for Blueberry, Ricotta and Bacon. So it\'s only right you\'ll find a wild blueberries and ricotta pancake topped with vanilla bean ice cream, streaky bacon and fresh fruits. Each bite delights with rich buttery pancake dulcified with maple syrup, it\'s easy for one to devour on own. Due to long preparation time, it is only available on Tuesdays to Fridays!
$5 flat white coffee that is silky smooth and well balanced. It has a nice nuttiness to it :) I like the flowery saucer that adds a certain hipster nature to the place. The temperature is also perfect!
I love linguine and this aglio olio style dish pleases me on every bite I take. The pasta is lightly fragrant and peppered, but combined it with the salty shredded duck creates an intense flavor that I can\'t stop wanting to have another bite. For ($18), this dish seems to be shadowed by the other signature dishes from Artistry, but it surely has made a mark on my list of pastas to go for a craving.
A recommended dish by Burppler Elvina and Andre, this is easily one of their top dish on the menu hands-down. The pancakes are truly different from other pancakes I have tried, slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It\'s also interesting to see bacon strips, strawberries, blueberries and vanilla ice-cream all on top of the same dish. As this is an all day breakfast, you can also order this for dinner, just like I did. üòã
Price: $20.00\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Bugis  \n<br />üìç: 17 Sungai Pinang\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Craving for a good breakfast, so action speaks louder than words. So here am I! \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The kale chips are the best . Its flavour was not too salty and when you start sinking into it, you could hear the crunchy texture in your head. Let\'s not forget about the bacon, it\'s texture and flavour was well balanced. As for the rest, they were decent, but nothing memorable. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, I wish the scramble egg and the Hollandaise sauce could stood out but they did not. Maybe the big breakfast besides me would fair better?
Price: $25\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Bugis\n<br />üìç: 17 Sungai Pinang\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Tuck away from the bustling streets of Bugis, artistry offers a much quieter place to enjoy a quiet bunch with your love ones and friends. Artistry is somehow unique in the way that, it offers both food and art under one roof. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The star of this dish was the homemade Chili sauce, it was flavourful, tasting both sweet and spicy at the same time. Just give me a bowl of plain rice and it\'s enough. As for the crab patty, it\'s fillings was stuffed with lots of crab. However, it is a little dry to eat on its own. It was the same for the fries. As such, my sauce was soon liberated... üò≠ \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, this dish contains its own unique taste, especially for the Chili sauce. It is different from the ones you tried at any seafood restaurant. I finished every last drop of it. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />I would like that take this time to thank my friends would wish me happy birthday and the special one whom planned my birthday celebration on my special day. I would like to thank you for accepting me 10 months 16 days ago and continuous showering me with love. I may not be the best guy out there, but i will promise you to shower you with love and protect you. Finally, I would like to say I love you!
Didn\'t regret having this as the buffet I went after this was üëéüèø. Anyways this is called the BIG breakfast. There\'s scrambled eggs, streaky bacon, potatoes, mushroom, spinach snd toasted brioche. Really loved how creamy the scrambled eggs was. üòå‚ò∫Ô∏è

B for Berry. R for Ricotta. B for Bacon. One of the best pancakes I ever had in SG üòç‚ò∫Ô∏èüòã The pancakes had the right amount of butter and all other ingredients you\'d expect, not to mention that slight ooze of müçÅple syrup that leaks every time you slice a piece of that pancake. No pancake combination would be complete without a good ole scoop of plain vanilla ice cream! This plate was such a dream come true üòä‚ò∫Ô∏èüíñ None would regret ordering this!
Krispy kale!!! Still in awe of the Krispy curlies üòÉüòÑ A fairly good combination of greens, carbs &amp; protein! Yumm yumm, think I devoured this too fast! üòÇüòä it sure looks kinda frazzled, but it was soo crisp-tasty and balanced with all the right stuff: kale for greens ‚úÖ, hash balls for carbs ‚úÖ (albeit fried but it\'s kay la; eat healthier for the next meal) and eggs for protein &amp; choline - Vitamin B-ish ‚úÖ
streaky bacon, scrambled eggs, portobello mushroom, baby spinach, baby tomatoes, sausages and butter on sourdough toast. Excellent brunch!
The real krabby patty. Gosh just look at it! Every bite of this was so delightful. I like my burgers the classic way with beef, but this one made me happy the way no other beef burger in SG has done before! Hahaha. I love how they kept the accompaniments to a minimum, only lettuce and tomato, letting the patty and and the chili crab sauce (in a separate bowl) shine. Oohh, and the bun they used was great too! Not dry, unlike most places. Lastly, it comes with a generous portion of nicely done crispy fries. Excited to go back and try their famed PB&amp;J french toast!

You will find no beef, melted cheese or onions in the famed Artistry Chilli Crab Burger ($25). Instead, what you will find is a breaded crab cake generously stuffed full of blue swimmer crabmeat with two sundried tomato buns and a generous serving of luscious chilli crab sauce served on the side. How you want to eat this is entirely up to you, but we recommend dunking your shoestring fries into the chilli crab sauce and getting some of it on your burger. Unconventional, and so, so good. We\'re confident declaring that this is one of the best renditions of our iconic local dish. Bring your friends and make a brunch gathering out of it!\n<br />Photo by Burppler Riche Ngo
Sadly the gorgeous looking and sounding waffle is not available at weekends so we settled for the equally enticing peanut butter and jam brioche french toast served with a ball of vanilla ice cream from the dessert menu and were not disappointed. The toast was light and fluffy inside and gently crisped outside. The peanut butter and jam filling the perfect combination with this delicious treat, at $14 the portion was filling, well priced and well worth a trip.
Disclaimer: Lovely environment with a good looking barista. // See that potato ball on the scrambled eggs? That\'s the Pomme Noisette. Which is really nice as it goes well with what\'s on the plate. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª Good music, great companyüòå Thankful ~ 
Tried this as a slider eons ago and it was nay; but as the full burger, I have to agree with all Artistry fans that their Chili Crab Burger really is a force to be reckoned with. I\'ve never had a crab cake that\'s so huge, and comes packed with only two ingredients: sweet, fresh crab, and ‚Äî no, not the usual potatoes/flour, but ‚Äî lots and lots of rich and tasty crab roe. If you could imagine the essence of crab in a patty, this\'d be it. Served with a totally on-point chili crab sauce, fluffy toasted buns, and a side of decent garlic fries, it\'s hard to find fault with this one.
Creamy, tangy, al dente linguine and slices of mushroom. Not a fan of onions, didn\'t realise it was cooked with it. It was an all right dish but not for the price of $18. 
3 x perfectly-done juicy 100% Black Angus beef patties, crispy bacon, aged cheddar, caramelised onions, guacamole, lettuce and fresh tomato in between toasted mini buns.\n<br />3 x the bliss. üòãüòãüòã\n<br />And let\'s not forget the fries.
Chili crab burger at its best! The patty is made with real crab meat wow! The pasta was so so and we had 1 for 1 pint of beer during the happy hour. Will go back again for the burger.
A delightful combination of potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, portobello mushrooms and finally topped with kale leaves. Eggs were soft and smooth while the potatoes were crispy. Overall, the ingredients were very fresh and brought out a distinct flavour better than the sum of its parts. This dish is definitely one of the must haves at Artistry for brunch on a Saturday!!
One of the top recommended dishes by Burpple. Great choice! Never too early for a Chilli Crab burger during brunch!! The sauce compares to and may even be better than your famous neighborhood zichar stall\'s!! Pity the fries were too hard. Else it\'s a delightful fusion food experience for your taste buds :)
A fan of the sausage and spinach üòª it is S$22 but I\'m not so sure that it worth the money 
While the toast achieved a balance of flavors of peanut butter and jelly, it lacks of a memorable flavor intensity and texture. Vanilla ice cream served on the side is creamy and great tasting. There\'s a premium vanilla taste and mouthfeel to it. 
Almost every table has this dish when we walked in, making it a must try. I tend to agree that the kale leaves heavily oily mouthfeel on the tongue and that\'s not very pleasant. If something could be done to improve that, this would be a nice and balanced breakfast/brunch option. 
Saw this pop up on my Burpple feed (thanks @prashant_s!) and decided to make a beeline for it. I am so pleased because this Pork Belly Burger, a special of the day, turned out to be nothing short of spectacular. Braised till tenderness maximus, the meat was very soft and deeply flavourful while the fat literally melted in my mouth. Unfortunately, this burger was doomed to live a woefully short existance. Because once I finished snapping this pic, I chomped it down in less than two minutes. Ok, maybe one. üòÅ
Slices of pillowy brioches that\'s oozing peanut butter and raspberry jelly, drizzled with maple syrup. Spread some sourish berries compote and vanilla ice cream for the unforgettable combination.
As a cafe, Artistry surprisingly serves up really good deserts! Their new BRB Pancake @ $18 (in picture), which stands for Blueberry, Ricotta &amp; Bacon Pancake, was definitely on par with that of Paddy Hills (which was $20+!) It has a generous amount of topping and the pancake/hotcake was fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside, buttery and warm. Not to mention their vanilla bean ice cream which always hits the mark. \n<br />Don\'t forget to try their popular PB&amp;J French Toast with Vanilla Bean ice cream ($14). I can\'t give it any less than a 10/10 because it\'s THAT GOOD üòã
Delicious peanut butter and jelly hidden in the French toast! I\'m not sure what peanut butter they use, but it\'s definitely not the typical skippy PB. Theirs is less salty and much less sweet, perfect as the hidden gem in a French toast. \n<br />#freewifisg
Shredded crab meat in a croquette form, served with bread, fries and a spicy sauce. \n<br />Yummy! What\'s not to love especially when the crab meat is already removed from the ü¶Ä pincer for you? \n<br />However, do note that shredded crab meat is used. Just like minced meat is different from pork slices, this cannot be compared to whole crab meat. The sauce though spicy and appetizing, is also not the same as the chilli crab sauce we are used too.  But set your expectation right and you will certainly enjoy this! \n<br />#freewifisg
Highly recommended French toast from the Burpple apps ,and of course didn\'t disappoint us üòçoverall rating :4/5 .
Very small amount of food and cost sgd. 20.00 ,the whole plate tasted oily ,bacon is too hard ,nothing special for this dish .Overall rating :1/5 üëéüèª
Burger served with crab party ,heap of fries and a bowl of chili crab sauce cost SGD 25.00 ,no harm to try as hard to find chili crab burger in Singapore !Overall rating :3/5 
If there\'s only time to visit one cafe from this guide, it has to be Artistry, where both food and coffee are excellent. Swing by this cafe cum casual art gallery with a group of friends for brunch, or for coffee and a sweet bite. For a group of four, we recommend sharing two mains to save space for dessert. On a cool day, sit alfresco and relax on the black and white porch. Order the famed Artistry Chilli Crab Burger ($25) that sees a ridiculously generous patty of blue swimmer crab meat. It comes with a heap of fries and a bowl of irresistible chili crab sauce to dunk everything in. Another standout is the Potato Hash and Scrambled Eggs ($20) ‚Äî a light plate of silky scrambled eggs, surprisingly crisp kale and bacon, and little fried potato balls. After digging into the savouries, you must have the PB&amp;J French Toast ($14). Expect peanut butter smeared in between two pillowy slices of brioche, vanilla bean ice cream topped with mixed berry coulis and a scattered bed of speculoos cookie soil. Be sure to get every component in one forkful, and pair it with a cup of their excellent Flat White ($5) or Gibraltar ($5), a double-shot of espresso with just a bit of milk.

I was determine to order their Artistry Chilli Crab Burger ($25) during my 3rd visit! Legit handpicked blue swimmer crab patty was both sweet and tender, mixed greens, tomatoes and sundried tomato buns brushed with Japanese mayo. Served with a side of fries and their homemade chilli crab sauce which I absolutely loved. The sauce had a local feel which was all sweet, sour and eggy. It\'s no wonder why they were always sold out! üò¨üëçüèª\n<br />‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill whenever you spend more than $50\n<br />‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Really love the space here, especially when it\'s not too crowded. Got to relax while sipping on a warm cup of coffee, bittersweet with a strong finish leaving a slight aftertaste.

Playing more of a supporting role are the mixed greens and tomato slices as the real highlight was the huge crabby patty (this is the real deal and not some artificial crab meat) made up of blue swimmer crab meat. Sandwiched between sundried tomato buns that have put on some Japanese mayo sunscreen, this is one hot-looking burger. Served with a side serving of fries and homemade chilli crab sauce, this creates a whole new rendition of our iconic chilli crab dish.
Started with the amazing Chili Crab Burger at Artistry. The \"crabby\" patty is one of the best ones I\'ve had so far! ALL THAT CRAB MEAT UNF. #Burpple #BurppleSG #TastyTastemakerTour
Mr Krabs has got NOTHING on this bad boy. A crab patty that\'s thicker than Alexandria Daddario and stuffed full of succulent, sensationally seasoned, actual honest to God crabmeat with just a light dusting of batter to seal the deal is seated upon its throne of a perfectly toasted bun and is crowned with another perfectly toasted bun. 
Artistry Chilli Crab Burger. \n<br />The first stop of today\'s super fun and exciting Burpple Tasty Tastemaker Tour! üéâüéâüéâ Veronica\'s suggestion is this packed and loaded crab patty, served with a savory and familiar Chilli crab sauce. The patty, breaded and fried is crisp on the outside while soft and sweet on the inside. Not to mention how THICK it is! Look at it! I was almost ready to pat my tummy and call it a meal there but Veronica had other plans... #4morestopstogo! 
Unfortunately my experience did not live up to the other reviews. I had the kale with scrambled eggs for the exorbitant price of $20 for a very small amount of food. The whole plate tasted oily to the point where there were no other flavours. Felt ill later on. But there I discovered the hair in the kale. I was told this was part of the kale. I don\'t know what kind of kale grows hair like that! Looked like hair to me and was only on one bit of kale not through the whole plate. Terrible experience on all accounts. Would not return again. 
Be it breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or any meal of the day; I probably can wipe it out on my own.

Bring back the weekends for me please. Need a cup of coffee badly nowüò¢
The serving was really generous given the price tag of $20 - this staple brunch item was really really goooood! Not to mention how protein packed it is! It deserves a re-visit with the same order!! The kale was super light and crisp!! I can\'t help myself shoving mouthfuls after mouthfuls of it!
Had this dish for $14 and felt it was totally worth it! Love the blend of the vanilla bean ice cream together with the french toast. The peanut butter was mild and not too heavy, which was nice. Even my girlfriend who did not like peanut butter loved this dish.
Of course this dish couldn\'t be missed after seeing so many other good reviews on it. Do not be fooled by the exterior of that crab meat patty. It might look normal on the outside, but we slice it, it was bursting with mouth-watering crab meat on the inside. I was blown away by how tasteful this dish was. Definitely a great dish. :) 
I was pleasantly surprised on how amazing the crispy kale tasted. Maybe it is partly due to it being my first time having kale that is crispy, but man it was delicious. And of course the scrambled eggs were fluffy and of the right texture. Initially this dish was ordered as a \"just-try\", but turns out it is a dish worth going back for. So simple yet delightful. :)
Hearty spells PB&amp;J French Toast &amp; Fried Kale with Potato Hash. Mmmm ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Soft and smooth with the right amount of portion. Its no wonder why this place is jammed pack most of the time.

Spent about $66 on a lunch for 2, including desserts and coffee of course. Main courses are around $20+/-. We tried the Slipper Lobster and the Big Breakfast. Followed by the PB&amp;J French Toast. Coffee was great, reminded me of the ones I had in Australia. Not too acidic, with a slight tinge of bitterness. Nice ambience, nice staff. Enjoyed the service and would definitely come back here again :) 
First visit to Artistry because its always so packed. Unfortunately, most of the popular items have been sold out. üòü I ordered their Big Breakfast ($22). Baby spinach, roasted mushroom and tomatoes, toasted rye, potato hash, scrambled eggs, bacon and chorizo make up for this heart breakfast. The highlight for me were the juicy chorizo and the buttery scrambled eggs. üòã\n<br />‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get 10% off your bill when you spend $50\n<br />‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Lemon tart with an added flavour twist. Tarts at artistry are from Windowsill Pies.
All time PB&amp;J sandwich with a side of ice - cream.
Of course we had to try their much raved about PB &amp; J French Toast (S$14). The peanut butter and jelly French toast is done with a beautifully crisp exterior, while the insides were moist and airy, filled with smooth peanut butter and raspberry jam. \n<br />Cookie soil was also drizzled around to give it extra crunch. Served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream, and topped off with bits of berries and jam (we requested to separate them as baby doesn\'t take them), we throughly enjoyed this dessert! It has the perfect harmony of flavours! \n<br />Our only complaint was that the French toast was way too little. Lol.
I tried a little and yes, it was good though I am not a very big fan of cream-based pasta. \n<br />Baby definitely enjoyed this as it was all gone within minutes.
Al-dente linguine tossed in garlic and olive oil, cooked with firm and succulent pieces of slipper lobster, kombu and cherry tomatoes. \n<br />It was really good! I totally love this! I am not exaggerating when I said I wiped the plate clean within minutes. Lol. \n<br />Definitely top my list for being one of the best, if not the best pasta we had in any cafes.
Lots of crab meat with just the right gravy #throwback #burpple
Good to try, but abit too jelat to have it by yourself!!! 
Price: S$20

Essentially a duet between the rich baritone of roast beef and the dulcet soprano of sweet dark cherries with back-up vocals from the melted cheese, tomato and baby spinach, within the compact concert hall of mixed grain bread. Not a typical combination for a sandwich but then the chef at Artistry does have a knack for putting a spin on dishes with palate-pleasing results.\n
Those who love their tipple will appreciate the intensely alcoholic kirsch-soaked cherries (more please, haha!) of the new Blackforest waffle at Artistry. When eaten with the decadent dark chocolate ice-cream, 70% cacao sauce and chocolate shavings, it delivers an interesting interpretation of a deconstructed Blackforest cake.\n<br />The only thing I reckon will make this even better is a big dollop of fresh whipped cream. I am keeping my fingers crossed that my feedback for its inclusion will be considered seriously. üòÑ
Raved about by Jayne Tan, whose taste in food I respect 100%, this was such a revelation in how a classic brunch dish can be creative without losing the plot. So, no high-brow experimental sh*t but proper tummy-filling yet tastebuds-surprising satisfaction instead.\n<br />Contributing the crunch factor: golden spherical hash browns (a.k.a. pomme noisettes), extremely crispy kale as well as my forever love - streaky bacon. Creaminess came courtesy of the luscious scrambled eggs and hollandaise sauce while the portobello mushrooms added meaty succulence. I was entranced by the mix of flavours and textures, so I took my time to relish the scrumptiousness in each bite. 
Need I say more about this signature dessert? The French toast was perfectly done; crisp on the outside with oozy PB on the inside. The vanilla ice cream and berry compote complemented the dish very well. Can\'t wait to go back for the other dishes. 
This completely sated my pasta craving today. The garlicky and slightly spicy burnt butter hazelnut sauce played a vital supporting role to the duck confit, which was clearly the star of this show. I really liked how those softened cherry tomatoes accented my every other mouthful of pasta with pops of juicy sweetness too.\n<br />Based on the favourable meat-to-linguine ratio happening here, it is pretty good value for money in my opinion.
The patty was made up of crabmeat. The chilli sauce was a tad spicy for my low tolerance for chilli. But overall it taste good!
Albeit a little sweet, I really enjoyed the chilli crab dip and the crab cake which had a generous portion of crab in it. And that brioche totally reminded me of a mantou when eaten with the dip. A first for me, but certainly not the last. \n<br />#burpple #artistrycafesg
üåº8/10\n<br />We waited for this for like more than 20mins? Aft I took my first bite.. I\'m like wow it taste quite nice, but then aft a few bites I realize there\'s a after taste which I dun rly like it. Maybe it\'s juz me but not that wow-ing to me for this Burger. But the sauce is rly no joke üòÇ damn nice. Price Is like $25 not that worth it but ok lah üòÖ
brought some friends along and I finally got to try the panini which artistry recently brought back mm the melted cheese sandwiched in the middle is chewy and stringey and mElty and ya it went really well with the roast beef HAHA was expecting the cherries to taste out of place but nOpe they complemented everything nicely yassssss artistry is gr8 
Went whoa when I first ate it but got increasingly jelat. The chilli crab sauce does help though. Not a dish I will want to have again. Priced at $25. Edit: Encountered dismal service here due to the \"brunch peak hour\". Oh well.
Love love the brown butter used in this! So fragrant and delicate. Accompanied the shredded duck confit well. Great dish at $18.
|\n<br />No wonder it costed $20+++ because the entire party was made of pure crab meat. Chilli Crab sauce on the side made it felt so \"Singapore\". With a glass of ice cold latte, this was what I called a Happy Meal.
Closed my eyes and he brought me through a journey. Started with \"Climb\" which is from his time in National Service, then the struggle he had to go through when he was coming out with scatterbrains. \'Assembly\' was his experience when he started to learn Swimming, which I found very deep and had many strong emotions. Religion, Christianity, is also one which plays a very big part in my life, so when he shared \'Auditorium\', everything made alot of sense. And as I was also away from home during my time of studying, \'masquerade\' was something I could relate to. He read \'memoir\' and \'matter\', those 2 poems very close to him and it spoke a lot of his relationship with his Mother to end off for tonight. Great structure and spoken with so much finesse. Thoroughly enjoyed it. @artistrycafesg #artistrycafe #artistrycafesg #speakeasy #poets #poetry @ethosbooks
Great ambience + the food is delicious . Mushroom pomodoro cost $16 and the portion is just right for me . This had been my third time to artistry cafe , it never fail to satisfy my cravings . 
Had the peanut butter and jelly French toast ($14), which was incredible, the Artistry crab burger ($20), also incredible. But the prices were quite high, and the portions quite small.
Good Food means Good Mood! Have a great week ahead everyone.

I really appreciate the effort you have put in to plan and to bring me around (literally bringing me around raffles city to walk to raffles hotel. Lol) I love you, b. \n<br />And to all my friends who wish me via text, facebook, instagram or any other social media, a very big thank you for the wishes. Really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.
Both the potato hash ($20) and baked eggs ($18) were good... have not try their cake yet.. maybe next time.
2 pieces of fried dory served with fries and malt vinegar. Batter wasn\'t very crispy and it was a little moist on the inside. The malt vinegar goes well with the fish though. For 17 bucks, it\'s passable I guess. More of a hang/chill out place after a hectic day of work
one word to describe it: A-W-E-S-O-M-E üôåüèº
If you love peanut butter and jelly combination, you should definitely try it!! üòçüëçüèª
Only available on weekend brunch, the Chili Crab Burger is pretty elusive because it gets sold out quickly. Essentially a Crab Cake patty burger, the Chili Crab sauce had been thoughtfully served at the side for those whom might not be so resistant to spiciness. Crab cakes were done with shredded crab meat, so it\'s pretty filled with crustacean flavour without using too much fillers, while the accompanying sauce is of mild spiciness and reminiscent of the familiar local classic which makes a good dip for the crispy fries. Thought that the bun could have been better if it tasted less doughy. A well-executed and designed western-local infusion that works; I like how Artistry somehow always find a way to infuse local flavours into western dishes without cheapening the idea of the western execution, yet not compromising on the true flavours of the local dishes it is made to replicate after.
Was expecting a tall, light &amp; fluffy souffl√© but this was quite dense &amp; not molten. Can\'t really taste Nutella. I like the dark chocolate gelato &amp; brandied cherries thou\'.
Well-scrambled eggs, two slices of toasted bread, a grilled sausage with a crusty exterior, tomatoes and baked beans - it\'s everything one could ask for in a breakfast plate done well. Artistry has lots of amazing dishes to order so this is usually overlooked. But on days I\'m in the mood for something simple and hearty, this fits the bill perfectly.
wonder if they still have it on the menu \n<br />apologies for the burst fire posts. I knew I had to try this cool, finally non squared version! never liked squares.
Flat white was smooth and probably one of the better ones around too. Price is pretty standard - $5 a cup plus no GST and service charge. ;)
This was really delectable. Probably one of the best French toasts I had so far besides Ronin and Wild Honey. I finished the whole plate and left with wanting more. 
Peanut butter and raspberry jelly stuffed toast, spiced vanilla custard, speculoos cookie soil, maple syrup, vanilla bean ice cream and mixed berry coulis „Äã$14
Served with hÃ∂oÃ∂uÃ∂sÃ∂eÃ∂mÃ∂aÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂gÃ∂rÃ∂eÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂ Ã∂pÃ∂aÃ∂pÃ∂aÃ∂yÃ∂aÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂aÃ∂dÃ∂ fries „Äã$17
We enjoyed this, Artistry never disappoints. Batter for the dory was so light and crispy, comes with vinegar and mayo. Was supposed to be accompanied by green papaya salad but they replaced with fries - crispy thick cut ones so that\'s good too.
Goma sesame seaweed, spring onion, chili flakes, cherry tomatoes, topped with parmesan cheese &amp; chilli threads. This was so good!! Al dante, flavourful, with succulent chunks of slipper lobster. Our only gripe is the portion wasn\'t very big hehe. Set us back by $20 but what a treat.
Wonderfully crisp on top, lending into a pillowy fluffy inside that\'s stuffed with a delicious peanut butter spread, is Artistry\'s PB French Toast. It\'s the second time I\'m having it, and still it doesn\'t fail to impress. Topped with a berry coulis and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it\'s an elegant rendition of the humble American breakfast sandwich. I can\'t rave about it just enough!
BRB (blueberry, ricotta and bacon) pancake with vanilla bean ice cream and fresh berries that is only available Tues to Fri 9am to 12pm. The delectable taste of the sweet fluffy pancake with crispy edge is further enhanced by the addition of salty bacon and sweet maple syrup making it one of the best pancake I have ever tasted. It\'s even better than Paddy Hills rendition.
The entire combination for this cake seemed interesting and I just had to give it a try. The banana scent was subtle but just about right. Chocolate on top was smooth but I\'ve to take issue with the cake texture. A tad too dry
#thefoodjournalist #kieffereats #comfortfood

Scrambled egg was well prepared, it was moist in texture with a creamy consistency.
Wild Mushrooms, cherry tomatoes,  garlic, onion and chili flakes all tossed in a creamy tomato sauce! \n<br />I really loved the creamy tomato sauce,  which reminds me of the times when I tried out my culinary skills which involves me adding cheese to my tomato pasta sauce! This was the kind of flavour I was trying to achieve, which I failed miserably at home üò¢
Made a mental note to try this when I saw a pretty photo of it circulating on Instagram. True to its description, this was decadently rich; the souffl√© contained a rich molten chocolate ganache in the middle that\'s thick, luxurious and rich. The warm souffl√© when put together with the smooth and rich Nutella ice-cream creates a harmony in flavour, yet a distinct contrast in temperature, coupled with the luxurious brandied cherries and cookie soil. Very rich and sinful, but also a very classy and elegant dessert at the same time!
Essentially the oral equivalent of a warm smother by Aphrodite‚Äôs bosom. 4/5
Technically a rich NUTELLA flavoured molten lava cake with dark chocolate gelato, mint, cookie soil and brandied cherries.
It\'s probably no surprise that Artistry\'s PB&amp;J French Toast ($14) is on the list. Thick slices of brioche French toast are stuffed with peanut butter and raspberry jam, drizzled with maple syrup and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a tart mixed berry compote. Grab and smear, dip and spread. Aim to get a bit of everything (especially the speculoos crumble) in a single bite. You\'re guaranteed a massive flavour and texture party in your mouth. This one, you\'d want all to yourself.
This Blueberry Ricotta Bacon Pancake is so so so so so good! Crispy on the outside while moist on the inside, topped with fresh berries and STREAKY BACON,  drizzled with maple syrup and finished of with vanilla bean ice cream. The deadly combination of these things makes it SO GOOD!!!! BUTTTTT only available Mon-Fri 9am to 12pm in limited portion.
This blueberry and ricotta pancake is everything I\'d want for brunch after a long week. The batter is so fragrant, and fries up real crisp and tasty topped with perfect bacon and berries. I\'d say share this between 2 if u want to go for another savory breakfast item, but I\'d also say don\'t share cos it\'s so yum. 
Version 2.0 of Artistry\'s legendary pancake is every bit as good as its original incarnation although there are minor tweaks. Proportion of the creamy ricotta cheese, sweet blueberries and salty, crispy bacon has been adjusted slightly so you can taste more of the buttery, fragrant batter. The pancake is also thicker but that\'s not all. This time round, ice-cream and other berries have been invited, and they come bearing gifts of icy-cold vanilla goodness and fresh fruitiness respectively. I\'d say this is definitely a must-try for those who\'ve always adored the famous pancake here and those who didn\'t have a chance to enjoy it before. Do note it is only available on weekday mornings though.
Was there for a mini gig performed by my friend. Vanilla ice cream with sour-sweet strawberry flavored topping on it matches really well with the toast coated with cinnamon. 
No complaints at all- this dish was totally on point üëç pesto, duck and linguine combination was perfect üòç
A unique and refreshing combination :) a bit too bready for me but that\'s cos I don\'t like bread that much/prefer rich fillings :p wld have been awesome w a bit more peanut butter stuffing + imagine it w Nutella üòç
The pasta was cooked al dente, and was incredibly well-flavoured due to the pesto. It had the right amount of saltiness and oiliness, and wasn\'t too overpowering. It was the right balance of flavours such that it wasn\'t too jelat. They didn\'t stinge on the duck confit, and a generous amount was mixed into the pasta. 
and it didn\'t disappoint! They have only few dishes listed on their menu and everything that we ordered is a must-try! This #ChilliCrabBurger is highly recommended! The patty is so yummy and you can never go wrong with the chilli crab sauce! Superb! üòãüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª üçî
Eggs, Beans and Sausage(top left), Sea Salt Caramel and Bacon Waffles(bottom right). After months of disappointment, finally I get to experience and taste the food here, I understand what\'s all the hype about. Cafe is like a mini gallery where they sell portraits of street photography and the foods are at affordable prices. On occasional nights, gigs would set up the speakers and instruments and come play.

Chilli Crab Cake Burger and PBandJ French Toast. Will love it even more if it comes with more peanut butter! *drools* But nice mix of berry compote with peanut butter, plus the ice-cream! Good food doesn\'t have to look pretty! 
I was quite hesitant to order this because of mixed reviews about the insufficient amount of peanut butter. But man, it\'s really love at the first bite. The vanilla bean ice cream blends really well with the sour mixed berry compote, raspberry jam and maple syrup. The brioche was a perfection (without being too fluffy or soggy) especially after being soaked in the ice cream and raspberry jam! I found the peanut butter to be just of the right amount such that I didn\'t feel jelat at all (and instead wanted to eat more, more and more...). It was really an explosion of flavours in my mouth. Worth to come back for!
[$18] The title says it all! Poached eggs topped with feta cheese over-layering chorizo and other ingredients is probably the best combo I\'ve had for brunch. Each complimenting the other as you dipped the toast. Yummmmm üòãüç¥ It might look as thou it can barely fill a stomach but think again üòâ
Sea salt caramel &amp; bacon waffles. MUST try! Breakfast and dessert all at once in this perfect blend of salty and sweet on a light and crispy waffle. Slightly pricey at $14.
Duck confit pesto linguine from Artistry. The well-oiled and suitably salty linguine was highly satisfying, despite being seemingly sparse on the meat side and the combination of green pesto and duck confit looking a wee bit sewage gloop-esque. 4/5
I wonder why I took so long just to try Artistry\'s highly raved PB &amp; J French Toast but now I can finally say that I came and I conquered this dish, or rather, be conquered by it.
I went with my friends when it was almost their closing time but thankfully we were able to buy the cakes and their drinks. We bought the Red Velvet and Chocolate cake (i can\'t remember the name). It was really delicious and quite affordable for a big slice of cake. The service that Artistry provided was really good. 
IT WAS SO SO GOOD. the buns were so soft and yummy but the Peanut Butter Jelly French Toast was the absolute winner üòã
I was disappointed to see barely noticeable layers of peanut butter and raspberry jelly when I made the first cut. @iamjaynedoe told me try it anyway, making sure I had a little bit of everything. So I smeared the toast with the mixed berry coulis, dabbed it on the speculoos cookie soil and topped it with some vanilla bean ice cream. What followed was a devilishly tasty party in my mouth.\n<br /> \n<br />The peanut butter was surprisingly pronounced while the acidity of the coulis helped to cut through all the richness. Most importantly, the pillowy bread soaked up just enough of the spiced vanilla custard, with a spot on level of sweetness. 
Never expected this to be so good. The patty itself is barely a patty, simply a generous portion of crab meat held together by the lightest, crispest crumbs. The chili crab sauce on the side is the bomb, the perfect dip for the fries. This is truly an example of the standard that cafes should strive for in their mains. I would give this ten thumbs up if I had ten thumbs. 
Succulent chunks of slipper lobster are cooked with strands of kombu and spagetti in aglio olio style. Chef Gerard who heads the kitchen at Artistry likes intense flavours, so his aglio olio is the extremely garlicky type which I personally adore (but NOT on days when I have meetings with clients - haha). \n
they were recommending their signature CHILLI CRAB BURGER lol omg fusion dish max. you can never go wrong with chilli crab sauce yo. just as fool-proof as SALTED EGG SAUCE üòç #burpple
Ever so slightly pricey for its portion ($20), this is still a dish I would order again. Each element is so well done, you\'ll certainly be satisfied. I like that it gives me room to nosh on a sweet item afterward! The kale is so crispy and yum with the silky eggs, and the bacon is surprisingly good. Those little perfect balls of potato are such fun to eat!
There\'s a real good reason why everyone loves this so much, it\'s just so damn good. If you love French toast and haven\'t tried this yet, you\'re truly missing out. The toast is exactly what you want, warm and eggy, and the compote + ice cream is enough to blow u away. Combine all that with delightful crumble on the plate and you\'ve got textural heaven. Just wait till you take a bite and get that peanut butter sitting pretty in the middle of that toast..
Very smooth coffee and the roast is just really nice my husband and I loved it
As I have a major pig-out session scheduled for tonight, lunch had to be a light affair so I chose the Caprese Salad at Artistry.\n<br />Once again, they prove they don\'t do things run-of-the-mill. Tomatoes were the Italian on-the-vine sort that\'s been roasted till slightly squishy, the basil pesto sauce\'s made in-house, and as a final touch, toasted almond flakes were sprinkled all over. Yums.\n
T.G.I.F, peeps! üòÅ
Finally went when it was opened after three tries and it didn\'t disappoint üòÅ cakes and beer and the LEGENDARY pb&amp;j waffles YUMZ
Finally got to try their PB&amp;J French Toast, and ohgoodheavens it is defo the best French Toast ever. Like ever. Absolutely nailed the texture. Only gripe is I couldn\'t taste any PB - but for the stellar French Toast I\'ll close both eyes.
At first glance, the dish may come off as odd, combining both sweet and savory together. But how can you resist having waffles, ice cream, sea salt caramel and bacon in one dish? Just awesome. 
This has gotta be one of the most beautifully decorated breakfast! Scrambled eggs, portobellos mushroom, crunchy kale, back bacon and yummy potato hash balls; each so good on its own but comes together really well as well. Portion is smaller than your usual big breakfast, but just nice without feeling too full for brunch! 
Al-dente linguine tossed in minced garlic &amp; olive oil with firm &amp; succulent slipper lobster, kombu &amp; cherry tomatoes. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese, spring onions &amp; shredded chilli threads. \n<br />We were either too hungry or the pasta was so good that we wiped the plate clean within minutes. I believe it must be both. haha.
 3 thick slices of peanut butter and raspberry stuffed toast drizzled with maple syrup. Served with vanilla bean ice cream topped with mixed berries coulis. So good but would be perfect if there\'s more peanut butter in the toast.
My first savoury waffle ever and definitely will not be my last.
In spite of the rustic design of the plate, there is a fine dining air about this dish. You can tell that every element has been chosen and prepared with care. For me, it is the creamy sauce drizzled all over that does the excellent job of bringing the salty bacon, crisped bitter-ish kale, juicy portobello mushroom and crunchy potato balls together harmoniously. Portion is modest, so there\'s room for a slice of Artistry\'s cakes after.
Naturally when I learned that Artistry was launching a new menu that included a baked eggs dish as of today, 1st April (and it wasn\'t a joke), I headed straight over for breakfast.\n<br />The Napoli sauce in which the two eggs were immersed, positively burst with flavours! Illuminated with fresh herbs, the savoury, spicy tomato gravy was chunky with broken-up Spanish chorizo sausage, pieces of bell peppers, onions, and finished off with crumbled feta cheese. I made sure to scoop up every bit with the multigrain toast served alongside. \n<br />#artistrysg #newmenu #alldaybreakfastsg #bakedeggs #eggporn #instafoodsg #sgfood #sgcafe #cafesg cafehopping #burpple
Thankful ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you\'re looking for which cafe/restaurants to go for a specific location, the Burpple app will do the job üòâ Have a great weekend folks.
Carrot cakes never appealed to me because I don\'t like cream cheese but daaaaamn artistry\'s carrot cake was so good I would eat this any day!!! for someone who often finds things overly sweet this was perfect and it was loaded with crunchy chunks of nuts!! :- ) 
Can barely open my eyes. A cup of #Gibraltar will be good.
Artistry\'s waffles are widely-raved and I can see the reason why; the batter is really crisp and buttery at a level where most waffles do not even come close. The crisp and savoury bacon strips were pretty fitting by enhancing the waffles themselves, and the salted caramel comes in fine as it gives a tinge of sweetness to the overall savouriness of the dish. And when the saltiness gets a bit overwhelming, there is always that scoop of aromatic Vanilla Ice-Cream which refreshes the flavours to smother on the waffles to lighten up the palate. Not forgetting the half-cut strawberries which were sweet too!
Have been hearing lots about their burgers, so we dropped by last week. Patties and buns were great, but the sliders were so drowned in mayo it\'s awfully disappointing üò†
Three cheeses on herbed chicken, tomato salsa, jalape√±os and treacle cured bacon on sundried tomato buns with truffle fries on the side. Loving this but missing the nasi lemak burger!
The combi of PBJ eggy toast, berry compote &amp; vanilla ice cream is perfect
Perfect start to the weekend. 
This part-art-gallery-part-cafe has made big waves in the cafe scene, and not just \'cos they serve great brunch and coffee. Artistry also provides creatives with a platform to debut their work through exhibitions, performances, talks or events that never fail to entertain. Fans of Artistry\'s food would be pleased to know they\'ve extended their opening hours, making it possible to squeeze in that morning cuppa at 9am (an hour earlier than before), and also grab some sliders ($18) after work from their brand new dinner menu (till 9.30pm)! Choose from 8 different flavours like Angus Beef &amp; Bacon, or Lamb Tzatziki, and wash them down with a couple of drinks after a long day. For dessert, don\'t miss their notorious PB&amp;J French toast ($14)!
The cup of cappuccino was just nice. Not too milky or too strong for my liking. 
Artistry crab cake burger with a twist with chili crab sauce at side. It\'s no wonder their crab cake is so popular, the cake patty is moist and generous with crab meat! Their burger bun were made similar to the fried mantou which I happily dip into the tangy spicy sauce.
But it was simply bitter! I usually disapprove the adding of sugar. But i couldn\'t tahan it today üòï
Brunch item off their CNY special menu. Pretty good even if a little pricey at $25. Even better with the strains of indie music playing in the background. 
Cafes Picked on Burpple list 2015:\n<br />1) Artistry, \n<br />2) Common Man Coffee Roasters, \n<br />3) Flee Away Cafe, \n<br />4) Flock Cafe, \n<br />5) Forty Hands, \n<br />6) I am, \n<br />7) PS Cafe, \n<br />8) The Lokal, \n<br />9) The Providore, \n<br />10) Whisk &amp; Paddle. \n<br />Keep calm and empty your coffee cups.
Artistry is keeping their doors open this festive season, serving CNY-inspired dishes that sound awesome. Think Chilli Crab Burger, Cheesy Chicken &amp; Bak Kwa Burger, and an intriguing Buttermilk &amp; Bourbon Vanilla Panna Cotta in Mandarin Orange Yoghurt Soup!  *18-20 Feb: 9.30am - 3.00pm
Returned to my old haunt for lunch, and after tucking into their Duck Confit Aglio Olio ($16 nett), I am kicking myself for having neglected Artistry for a while.\n<br />A new incarnation of their popular duck confit pasta dish, it features the garlic and olive oil style of preparation. With chunks of shredded duck confit that add a rich dimension of flavour, sweet cherry tomatoes, loads of chopped afore-mentioned garlic, a dash of chilli flakes and grated parmesan cheese, all mixed with the al dente linguine, you can be sure your tastebuds are in for a wild ride. 
That zesty filling in the eclair burst in my mouth when I first bit into it, and it was like a party on my palate. Do book your tickets for the #eclairforapurpose event from @shioksg if you haven\'t!
Topped with freshly grated coconut flakes, the moist cake with the spread of cream cheese got me devouring it mouthfuls after mouthfuls. Hands down, the best red velvet cake I\'ve ever had in my life.
I hereby conclude that I love everything kaya (except that drink I had recently, which was unsatisfactory)
The chicken pie was one of its kind, sweet pie with savory filling. Perfect. But the eclairs had their hits and misses.
Finally tried the PB&amp;J french toast ($14) from Artistry after one year of longing. AND. IT. IS. GOOD.
Too much #cocoa and #expresso that it was too bitter. Photo looks nice but drink didn\'t taste nice üëéüôäüò∑ kinda disappointed. Shall try other drinks in the future. \n<br />Follow us @foodreviewssg more honest reviews.\n<br />#foodreviewsasia
All ready for the weekend writing after 2 shots of espresso.
Creamy tomato vodka sauce linguine tossed with prawns, onions, cherry tomatoes and garlic.
Eggy and fluffy brioche stuffed with peanut butter and jelly, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and berry coulis
What? The chef flamb√©s the olive oil with white wine?! Ohhhhh... That probably explains why Artistry\'s aglio olio pasta has a slightly different taste from many of the others out there üòã The generous amount of ultra-sweet strips of capsicums, baby spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms saut√©ed with tonnes of chopped garlic could be the other reason. But to be frank, it\'s all the same to me because my mind blanks out in pleasure when I start eating üòù
This is the Bak Chor Mee Pasta - five-spice pork (pork confit) paired with handmade tagliatelle, tossed in a spicy piquant sauce. Tasted simply divine. Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh #Burpple @artistrycafesg @madamtans
Served during Chef Shen Tan\'s pop-up at Artistry where she took over the brunch menu serving her famed dishes such as Bak Chor Mee Pasta and Nasi Lemak. Was looking forward to this because I love Pulut Hitam! Combining the taste of Pulut Hitam into the execution of Sticky Date Pudding, you could taste the sweet glutinous rice within the pudding, which is made to taste like Pulut Hitam with the scoop of coconut ice-cream to replicate coconut milk. Served with a Gula Melaka Butterscotch which tasted pretty much like a decent Salted Caramel.
Chef Shen Tan\'s pop-up at Artistry this weekend bringing her famed dishes such as the Bak Chor Mee Pasta and Nasi Lemak, taking over the usual brunch menu. By the time we arrived it seemed that the Crispy Chicken and Pork Belly variants have sold out. The rice was fragrant but not too Lemak so it doesn\'t get too overpowering, while the grilled brinjal in curry hinted of spiciness and were adequately soft with some chew. The accompanying chili was good, but Chef Shen Tan\'s signature Sambal was the one that would make your tongue shriek yet wanting more!
Chef Shen Tan takes over the brunch menu at Artistry for this weekend\'s pop-up, whipping up dishes she is known for such as the Bak Chor Mee Pasta and Nasi Lemak. Linguine tossed in vinegar and chili flakes, the tart flavours of vinegar comes off strongly on the al-dente noodles. Pork Confit was tender with hints of 5 spices used to marinate the pork.
Not sure if the vegetables, all nicely mashed, were meant to be a reinterpreted giant-ass achar, since the explicit representation of the latter involves dry sticks. The rice was a bit vapid, but thankfully the two chillis - shoutout to the sambal belachan which methinks was sent from the dredges of hell to provide sweet painful pleasure to the tongue - helped the rice swallowing process and then some. 3.75/5 [Note: menu only available on 17 and 18 Jan 2015 as part of a guest chef weekend brunch takeover.]
Sticky date pudding does eat.pray.love in Asia and tries to fit in by learning how to dress and speak like the locals. Essentially a Pulut Hitam cake (!!) with surprisingly distinct glutinous rice bits. 3.75/5
This was contributed during an event held @ Artistry showcasing Madam Tan Signatures. 
One of the items on the menu previously at Artistry
Meepok\'s spiritual cousin writhes around saucily in a river of spicy pork cube gravy, its soft supple skin soaking up every drop of the sweet-spicy goodness. The pork confit flakes with the gentlest poke of a fork, all vulnerable and tender like a adolescent alpaca. 4/5
There will be three exciting weekends in the month of January and February 2015, where you can satisfy your sweet tooth for a good cause. L‚Äô√âCLAIR Patisserie will be having their second pop-up store at one of our favourite cafes - Artistry, where you will be served heartwarming coffee by the baristas and enjoy well-loved eclairs from L‚Äô√âCLAIR Patisserie set menu going at $30 nett (shares 1-2). Limited to 20 set menu per day, reservations for dining-in (Jan 31 - Feb 15, 3:30pm - 6:30pm) will be open on 23rd January. Tickets can be purchased through Peatix website (www.eclairsforapurpose.peatix.com), Shiok 2.0 collection of locally-designed premiums, apparels and more will be on sale at the event. 
A bountiful breakfast like this one from Artistry is just the thing to flag off a marathon day at work when you don\'t know if you\'ll be free to have another meal for a long, long time. \n
So instead of the PB&amp;J french toast, we had this blueberry crumble with ice cream.
Once I read on Artistry\'s Facebook page that they were having a special menu for their Christmas Eve Brunch, I \"choped\" seats for the first seating in a flash. The standard of food here is top notch, so I was really looking forward to trying new dishes by their chef. I also felt it was thoughtful that they requested for us to make our choices from the set menu ahead of time in order to prevent food wastage.\n<br />For my starter, it was scallops wrapped in bacon with ikura scattered all over. A bowl of comfortingly hot and thick bacon soup came next. The Wagyu steak pie, my main course, was an object of delicious deconstruction with an oblong puff pastry positioned alongside the most fork-tender hunk of Wagyu beef. I like that it was served with cloves of roasted garlic; they added a beautiful subtle creamy sweetness to the dish. For my sweet ending, I had the fluffy rum and raisin pudding with vanilla ice-cream. A lovely meal through and through.
This pretty-as-a-picture dessert was not part of my set meal choice from Artistry\'s Christmas Eve Brunch but I couldn\'t resist pinching a bit of it. So glad I did, otherwise I wouldn\'t have known how fragrant and wobbly-soft it was. Loved the fruity touch of the chilled light strawberry yogurt soup especially.
The raspberry jam was tart and sweet, a good complement to the eggy and soggy French toast. The peanut butter  inside the toast wasn\'t overpowering or too measly. 
Topped with shredded coconuts, the cream cheese frosting was thinner than other typical cakes, making the cake less sweet. Texture of the cake was smooth and velvety. No wonder it\'s a best seller. 
It\'s time to feast üòã and catch up on some backlogs.
Someone else fell in love with the waffles hereüòã second time eating this salted caramel bacon waffles, still good! Crispy and light. The roasted chicken from sandwich was really tasty too.
These addictive little critters were served at @Burpple\'s Christmas party last week: two-bite patties packed with sweet shredded crabmeat, bound in crunchy breadcrumbs, and topped with alfalfa sprouts. Addictive little critters. \n<br />#crabcakes #canape #sgfood #food #foodporn #sgfoodie #burpple #burppletastemakers
Cherry tomatoes &amp; mozzarella balls. #partyfood üòãüòã
Moist red velvet cupcakes, topped with creamy cream cheese and coconut flakes. Not a coconut lover but this one was acceptable! One is never enough, i even tau pau some home üòÑüòÑüòÑ
Very moist, dense but soft cupcake paired with a very good cream cheese frosting. Definitely one of the best red velvet cakes I\'ve had :)
Mmm... chicken satay SUPER UP-SIZED! Juicy, chunky pieces of chicken on a skewer with a side of an aromatic, peanut sauce that tasted more like a curry than the usual satay sauce. Yummy!
Will never go wrong with smoked salmon, cream cheese &amp; crackers combination though a sprinkle of lemon juice &amp; dill will please the palate even more.
The hint of curry flavor tingled with the palate and caused the mouth to drool. .\n<br />|\n<br />.\n<br />I am so going to make this.
The thanksgiving event by @burpple. \n<br />Had a lot of fun with other tastemakers.
Wonder how much cream they use to make this ultra-moist cupcake (it\'s crowned with shaved coconut on silky cream cheese). I could use some of this sugar right now. 
Grab a #coffee and have a great week everyone!

What\'s better than PB&amp;J? A PB&amp;J French Toast, of course.
Chunky chicken satay with sweet peanut sauce. So tender even Santa will approve! üòã
The starters and the stars of the night with their crunchy exterior while soft and tender on the inside. I could have stuff more into my mouth but.... they ran out and due to impeding sore throat.
See their serious faces üôå
Always a ball of a time when I\'m with these #foreverhungry friends, the people who share the same love of gluttony and excessive food photo-taking as me. Being named Burpple\'s Favourite Tastemaker 2014 was really the icing on the cake and very unexpected ‚Äì was I really the only one voting??? Lol. Seriously though, quite paiseh but also admittedly quite um chio to receive the award üòù ‚Äì a big and humbled thank you to whoever voted for me! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòò I\'m looking forward to more tremendous foodie fun with all of you, and the rest of the amazing Burpple community in 2015. üòä üòäüòä #burpple #burppletastemakers #classof2014 #foodies #sgfoodie
Latte never goes wrong at Artistry üòÑ though funny to have dinner over coffee for me
Final verdict was that it was duck!was rather intimidated by the size of portion of the bread to the duck and alfafa. But the taste was rather balanced regardless! Bite sized but i needed 2 or 3 mouth üòÇ
When serve, the tastemakers all let out \"ohhh\"ssss and \"ahhhh\"sss and wowwwsss. It\'s seems really impressive and taste even better! The satay comes in big pieces and marinated curry taste, and you can\'t stop dipping into that pot of peanut gravy as the curry and peanut sauce gives birth to a balanced taste, muting the spiciness while retaining the curry spice taste. The plate was quickly finished in no time.
Random things we do @ BurppleTastemakers X\'mas party! Balloon handphone case, anyone? Works on iPhone 4S, 6plus, Samsung! In fact, it should work on any phone! hahaha. Loving this #foreverhungry community. So much fun &amp; laughter whenever we meet.
One of the most moist cupcake I\'ve ever had. üòç and that cream cheese icing with coconut flakes üòçüòçüòç it tasted like they used real beets instead of red colouring.
Nobody knew each other and everyone was so shy. Tonight, I see real friendships, laughters (&amp; screams), merry making and Tastemakers creating ballon iPhone cases. Community is family. #burpple #tastemakers #realandpassionatecommunity
The first Christmas Party held at Artistry was everything in typical Burpple fashion; great food and great company with fellow Tastemakers. 2014 was full of surprises, from my first tastemaker eatup at Olive Tree for buffet dinner to having tried Cheese Fondues and Chocolate Fondues and massive burgers like the one from The Beast. Glad to have had food that I would never dream of trying before, and for knowing a community of dedicated foodies who are simply #foreverhungry. Looking forward to an even more awesome 2015!
Fell in love with their crab cake burger the first time I had it. Was so happy that I got to eat it again at a #burppleeatup üòÅüòÅüòÅ love how much crab they stuffed inside, and that crispy exterior is awesome. I secretly dipped it in their peanut sauce (that came w their satay) and made my own chilli crab cake! I loved it!
I still remember it was in the January of the year 2013, I just POP-Ed from BMT and nicely the first event from Burpple was placed during the block leave of mine. The team always thank us for making burpple awesome, I would like to thank @burpple for making my life awesome. It was their monthly or quarterly events that I always look forward to in my army/uni life that kept me sane. They even made me a tastemaker when I\'m just a normal guy who posts photos to burpple treating it like a food diary. I thank @burpple again for allowing me to meet fellow food lovers like @the_xw @alainlicious @veronicaphua @iamjaynedoe , all these awesome people makes my life really awesome. And again, thanks for making my ordinary life extraordinary. 2015 will be eve better! #burpple #artistry (burpple even taught me punctuality)
So much fun at #burpple eat up ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks @magicsheeeep for taking the photo (should have taken one w you too :( ) #ignoremyfatarms
Here\'s our dessert table, cupcakesssss üç∞
And it\'s a whole tray of them!
Marvel at the moist and fluffy cake! Really enjoyed this, the cake could be eaten on its own (unlike many other plain tasting ones that can\'t hold their own) and the light fragrant cream cheese brought it to the next level.  
A Red Velvet Cupcake that really defines Red Velvet. Had too many bland tasting Red Velvet Cakes, so Artistry\'s really stand out when I could actually taste the subtle cocoa flavour within. Cream cheese was smooth and luscious; a really luxurious dessert or tea-time treat!
Tender juicy chunks of chicken on a stick, dipped with peanut sauce that made this an upgraded version of the usual chicken satay.
Balls of Mozzarella that\'s all subtle in flavour, with juicy Cherry Tomatoes that burst of zesty tanginess.
Huge chunky chicken satays üòç everyone is as busy eating as they are taking pictures!
Duck rilette atop an herbed toast. 
Rather fresh slices of smoked salmon, cheese, parsley and sliced tomato atop a water biscuit. 
The first of the canap√©s served to us!
My personal favourite for today\'s Tastemaker Xmas Party is this; Chicken Satay. Never had I tasted one like this before; the chicken was so tender it was nearly melt-in-the-mouth, and that unique marinade sets in apart from other satays I had. Chunky meat on sticks that taste like kebabs, a pity I could never know how the sauce tastes like because of my allergy to peanuts!
A twist on a local classic - familiar satay \"buah\" (sauce) with super-sized chunky chicken kebabs. Most filling dish for the evening. Who says you can\'t get full from canap√©s? #BurppleTastemakers #ChristmasParty2014
Anything with smoked salmon is an easy crowd pleaser, this was no exception. Simple, pretty, tasty. Canap√©s are just the perfect party food - frills free, bite-size, conversation enablers. #BurppleTastemakers #ChristmasParty2014
Fun and pretty appetizers!
Fresh smoked salmon on table crackers with cream cheese spreads make for the savoury flavours. Cherry Tomatoes give that zesty burst of flavours which is refreshing!
Ordered one because I know I can always trust the baristas of Artistry for a creamy cuppa that fits my liking!
Just the right ratio of crab meat to crumbs. It\'s moist, well seasoned, and most importantly, not jelat as these tends to get. Loved popping it into my mouth! Perfect appetizer!
Since we had no idea what would be served for the evening, there was a mini debate over what these were - crabcakes or meatballs? And of course, our \"Favourite Tastemaker\" got it absolutely right! These crunchy crabcake balls were a delightful start for the party. A little greasy, but yummy stuff. #BurppleTastemakers #ChristmasParty2014
Starting Burpple\'s Xmas Party with the first dish; Crab Cakes. Lightly crusted with fresh, flavourful strips of actual crab meat inside. Now I know why their Crab Burgers are so popular!
One cupcake, so many ways to photograph... I mean, eat it ;) Isn\'t life so much more fun with Burpple? #BurppleTastemakers #ChristmasParty2014\n
Burpple tastemakers digging into the delicious, juicy chunky chicken satay and sauce. (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë) 
What food dreams are made of‚Ä¶ tender chunks of chicken covered in satay sauce‚Ä¶ at #BurppleTastemakers\' Christmas Party 2014. Thanks for the treat @burpple!!! #Satay #ForeverHungry #Burpple
Deliciously moist red velvet cupcake base topped off with rich cream and shredded coconut. The coconut is really fragrant as you bring the cupcake up for a bite! 
Three words: so so moist! Love how this was not too sweet and so very moist and soft. Everyone were commenting how surprisingly soft these were, you almost can\'t hold one up without wobbling it! And doesn\'t hurt that it\'s soooo pretty too :) #BurppleTastemakers #ChristmasParty2014
Don\'t underestimate these little gems on sticks. This was a welcomed refresher amidst the meal, juicy cherry tomatoes for the mid-meal thirst-quencher, complemented with chewy, mildly salted mozzarella cheese balls. An understated pick-me-up. #BurppleTastemakers #ChristmasParty2014
Tender chunks of chicken on a stick! The gravy sauce complemented it, think atas smoother version compared to the hawker stalls. But I did find the chicken to be a bit meaty.
The red velvet and cream cheese blended really well together, not too thick. The shaved coconut gave the cake a very unique taste too! ($7)
The chicken tastes a teeny bit undercooked but it tasted great. Could do with more of the sauce given! ($11)
This comes across as almost meaty despite being vegetarian. Somehow the portobello mushroom (simply bursting with flavour from having been grilled with olive oil and garlic), and the mozzarella cheese give that impression. Oomph-ing up the sandwich further are mixed herbs, sundried tomatoes and Dijon mustard. Nice, very nice. Heard that it is a very popular item and tends to sell out early too.
Hands down the most crispy waffles with a tinge of saltiness. The salted caramel sauce and bacon complemented each other with sweet &amp; salty, making it easy to down the waffles in just minutes! Yay to Tuesdays Waffles. 
I stopped reading when I saw PB&amp;J &amp; immediately ordered it without much thought. It is definitely the best of all the dishes ordered! The sour raspberry jam complemented the salty peanut butter stuffed toast so well! I couldn\'t resist taking another bite. 
I think I just have a mouthgasm üòç! Oh am gee!
The French toasts were stuffed with peanut butter &amp; raspberry jam is heavenly! As if it\'s not sinful enough, berries coulis, cinnamon &amp; cookies powder were drizzled all over and top with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. And I actually ordered this as my main for lunch! For $14, I ride through heaven. 
Brunch food with generous servings and use of fresh ingredients. Juicy pork sausage with creamy lightly flavored scrambled eggs. Shredded duck confit with flaky crispy croissant. Good brunch to kick start your day!
it\'s the combination of chilli, chicken, coconut, ikan bilis that makes a good nasi lemak. this is a nasi lemak burger - the chicken was good but did not have de overall nasi lemak feel. I guess nasi lemak should remain as it is. \n<br />have a  good week everybody!
On the table, the famed PBJ French Toast (right), Nasi Lemak Burger (top) and Duck Confit Croissant (left).
An interpretation of our coconutty rice: crispy chicken cutlet and a sunny-side-up between pandan buns covered in toasted coconut, with sambal chilli, peanuts and ikan bilis on the side. Jam-packed with flavour and best eaten with a bit of each component in every bite. 
SGD $14. Don\'t be fooled by its small portion. This French toast defines balance in a dish - not too sweet, not too salty. Flavors are not overpowering but rather they compliment each other very well. Also not to mention the spiced cookie crumbs for extra texture - so lovely! Ice cream is a bonus üëç
Mid/end of the week with what I can safely say is one of the nicest waffles I\'ve had. the waffles were light and so crispy! Fragrant vanilla bean ice cream went really well with it and their salted caramel was awesome. Like sweet and BAM salty. A little crispy smoked applewood bacon on the side made it a whole lot better. Everything went so well together. I\'ll be back for their sandwiches!! (All sold out except for portobello&amp;buffalo mozzarella but I wasn\'t in the vegetarian mood)
Fluffy pillows of brioche blanketed in fried egg wash, infused with peanut butter, stuffed with jam, and served with blueberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. What way to make my heart leap. 
Happy weekend lunch with the ex-partners in crime @azwuzz @cher_leong @chelsiatan. Can\'t believe it took me this long to come to this highly raved-about cafe. So impressed by the food; I\'m already making plans to come back.
Compact, so it fits easily even in my hand, this is a sandwich that delivers gratifying mouthfuls every time you sink your teeth into it.\n<br />Until you actually have a taste, it\'s hard to believe the amount of filling -- roast sirloin beef, wilted baby spinach, tomato, melted cheddar and mozzarella cheeses plus some Dijon mustard -- that\'s packed neatly between those slices of multi-grain bread. But the moment you do, you will. It\'s a flavour bomb üòã
The PBJ french toast at Artistry is back! \n<br />French toast stuffed with peanut butter and raspberry jam drizzled with maple syrup and spiced cookie crumble and topped with vanilla bean ice cream and mixed berry coulis. Who could resist such temptation?
As someone who usually wouldn\'t order french toasts, I must say that this is really good! The combination of sweet/tangy/savoury flavors, and warm/cool temperatures is rather perfect. 
The texture of the cake is soft..not that sweet, lychee is juicy as well :-) this cake is not dry which means is still fresh.
Drizzled with pure maple syrup, berry coulis and topped with vanilla ice cream. \n<br />An extra special touch has been added, which is Speculoos cookie crumbs, those brown specks of dust.
Thanks for the pick-me-up. Instant relief from all that corporate finance talk.
And true to its philosophy of constantly breathing new life into its menu (perhaps a tad too often), Artistry has done it again. This time, success was found in the form of a nondescript slice of black sesame sponge, slathered with a tangy cream cheese frosting that lent a pleasant contrast to the sweetness and nuttiness of the goma. Mmmm so good.
Can you believe they serve a WHOLE chicken thigh for this? Having been roasted with lemon thyme, the juicy piece of boneless wonder has a golden, crisp skin and is infused with plenty of aroma. Lavished on top is a luscious lemon hollandaise sauce created in-house by Chef Gerard. As expected, it is simply sublime. \n<br />Another bonus is you get to choose from three types of breads for your sandwich: Rye, multi-grain or focaccia. I went for the focaccia (presented open-face style) as I was craving a soft bread today. Needless to say, I was more than satisfied with my choice üòã
and so..... I made it here for lunch! thanks to one of our fellow tastemaker, I got to know that the chef will be implementing a new menu so this BRB Pancakes ($8/single, $12/double) will no longer be available. (Today is the last day they\'d be serving this darling) Boo :( it\'s indeed worth the trip down and I\'m lucky that I managed to savor this! Think fluffy, buttery pancakes filled with blueberries, ricotta cheese and bacons on the top. It is really sinful but who cares! Price is nett, no GST or service charge so it\'s a free seating/order at the counter kinda concept. Can\'t wait for the launch of their new menu since they mention to me it\'s sort of an \"upgrade\" :)
wanted to try their big breakfast ($15) but it was sold out at 14:45. Penne alla vodka is cooked in creamy tomato sauce vodka infused accompanied with garlic-laden penne, 4 bouncy prawns, sliced onion and cherry tomatoes . Overall a good combi, apart from the Penne being a little too soggy (I prefer mine al dente/hard) I really enjoyed this dish. Will return for their PBJ French toast! Can\'t wait~
May the weekend passes as slow as possible.
Lychee martini cake!
Nice chill out spot. ‚ò∫ Best way to spent a Friday night. Good coffee. Good company. Good vibes.
Sweet, juicy blueberries populate this cake with wild abandon. Just take a look at my pic - isn\'t there as much purplish-blue fruit as there is yellow cake? In my book, crumble topping on any dessert can do no wrong. A cinnamon flavoured one on this cake? By all means.
Yummeh mix of choc and peanut butter in an awesome location
...after leaving work at 1000 instead of 0800 and rather tough shift (fax/copier machine was down, system offline, last minute returns, etc), i really needed the pick me up. (re-upload, because.... oh you know.)
It\'s as if air and batter were spun together to weave these exquisite quadrants of crunchy, yet floatily light Belgian style waffles. Such superior specimens deserve a befitting ice-cream, and that big scoop of Kapiti\'s ultra-creamy fig and honey flavour more than delivered.\n<br />It\'s also thoughtful of Artistry to serve the maple syrup in a tiny jug for customers to control the exact amount of sweetness they prefer. Speaking of maple syrup, they serve the real deal here. Not the fake, too-sweet (and cheaper) liquid that is all too prevalent. 
Dayum I missed you awfully, and unfortunately the French Toast is no longer available on the menu.  
Kaya &amp; Butter French Toast served with Coconut Ice Cream - kaya is such a nice twist to a familiar Singaporean flavour which we have all grown up eating. Each bite is perfectly matched with the warm toast and cold ice cream. Special mention would have to be the coconut shavings which adds another level of texture with each bite.
Burpplers represent! #burpple #thismenuisrelevant thanks Artistry for loving the community!
Admittedly, this is not ranked in my top 3 favourite cakes at Artistry but then again, I don\'t really like lychees to begin with. However, if alcohol-enhanced cakes float your boat, this is worth trying because the martini in there sure announced its presence - \"hic\".
I was completely seduced by the voluptuous mascarpone and generous liqueur of this tiramisu. I also can\'t quite explain why it\'s taken me forever to get around to ordering this. But logic lays the blame squarely on my being spoilt for choice. There are simply too many tempting cakes here!
If you\'ve stayed away from cheesecakes because you aren\'t into dense, heavy richness, this is one you should try because it is the complete antithesis of that.\n<br />Ever so slightly tangy, the texture of the cheesecake itself is silky smooth, almost tofu-like. Layered on top is a jewel of a ruby-coloured jelly filled with prettily arranged peaches and cherries. Together with the sweet crunchy biscuit base, this is a dessert that sparkles.
Why am I not surprised that Artistry has done it again, raising the bar on the humble croissanwich with their version. It boasts of spoil-you-silly slices of roast beef, baby spinach and their signature luscious creamy scramble packed into a wonderful buttery and flaky croissant. This place always comes up with new reasons for me to love it.
Felt truly blessed when I was surprised with a belated birthday treat from the kind folks at Artistry. What made this even more special was that it\'s the first time I was trying their signature zucchini cake (yes, shocking, considering how often I am there).\n<br />But coming back to the point I\'m trying to make... I could immediately tell why it\'s such a big hit with those who like carrot cake but aren\'t keen on raisins. Besides being very light, fluffy and fantastically moist, it was less sweet than most cakes. Thus when slathered with the lickably-yummy cream cheese frosting, equilibrium was attained. And for one brief moment, all was well in the universe - hurrah! 
This beats those lame chocolate drinks out there hands down because ladies and gentlemen, my glass of iced chocolate is made from the famous Cacao Barry brand. With more than 170 years of history and tradition, and a reputation for expertise and innovation in the gourmet world of chocolate, how can it taste less than absolute bliss? I\'m not kidding when I say my tastebuds were reveling in joy.
Delicious truffle fries, one of the best i ever had. Refreshing pesto pasta. It was my first try but a little too oily for my liking. Nice environment and nice crew there have there!
In love with this place! ‚ù§Ô∏è Standout dish especially for those w a sweet tooth craving something unique that hits close to home! Conducive studying environment w wifi, lovely outdoor seating, chill place to catch up w friends, clutch music, friendly service, cool art space, and they serve great liberty coffee! Tried their Gibraltar which was super üëå‚òïÔ∏è, creamy vegetable linguine and truffle fries üëç gotta try that Nasi lemak burger in the future! Recently extended their hours to 11pm on weekdays too! 
I call this the next level kaya butter toast: kaya and butter stuffed brioche French toast with coconut ice cream, sprinkled with toasted shredded coconuts. The combination of the ingredients compliments each other and this is so so good that I can have it all day everyday! The eggy brioche is pillowy and soft and when you spread some of the ice cream on it, you are immediately in food heaven! CHINHOJIAK!!
Been on the menu for a while and I finally get to try it. \n<br />The kaya and butter makes a good combination. However, I am leaning towards the former PB &amp; J French Toast. I missed you Peanut Butter and Jam.
Absolutely delicious.
I like its creamy sauce and linguine cooked just right... Just that I didn\'t like too much capsicum &gt;
Pasta + coffee + running man 
Flavorful body... HmmMmm.. Good for an afternoon chill where watching the world go by. 
Roasted sliced beef with two scrambled eggs, baby spinach and a dash of mustard mayo. Fuss-free yet satisfying üòä
Shredded duck with basil and pine nut pesto, pepper flakes, cherry tomatoes and grated Parmesan cheese. Full of complimenting flavors üëçüëç
Aha! Finally reached the main point of my whole visit to artistry! To try out this new dish which replaces their top-favorite; PB&amp;J French toast. Kaya and butter stuffed between the fluffy brioche. Topped with toasted coconut shavings and coconut ice cream and finally, finished with a drizzle of maple syrup. Now I get what the hype is all about üòåüòå I\'ll definitely will be back for more üëç As the saying goes \"there is far more better things ahead than those we leave behind\" I find it pretty apt in this context üòèüòè
Pulled pork grilled with mozzarella and aged cheddar, baby spinach, fresh tomato slices, mustard mayo and BBQ sauce. Sandwiched in a sundried tomato panini. This among all the food could be lacking, there wasn\'t any flavor from the roasted beef and the food was just one texture and one body. Nothing special. 
Toasted oats, raisins, cashew nuts, almonds, maple syrup and toasted coconuts. Served with Greek yogurt and minted fresh salad. People would say it\'s not very wise to pay $10 for something you could whip up at home but there\'s just something I really love about this simple dish which will make me order it whenever I\'m here. 
Two scrambled eggs with smoked beef sausage, roasted mushrooms, baby spinach and toasted brioche. There wasn\'t much to fault - although not my favorite but would still make a decent breakfast 
Coffee beans from liberty. Scored this latte at $5
This is da shit! I\'m not a fan of Reese\'s Buttercups but this cake got me HOOKED. The saltiness of the cream perfectly balances the sweetness of the chocolate fudge. Almost finished the whole slice by myself. Totally sinful but worth it!
Imagine if Peanut Butter and Chocolate met, fell in love, got hitched and did the rumpy-pumpy - well, this would be their gorgeous offspring. Lusciously moist, with intense peanut butter and chocolate flavours, this is a cake not to be missed.
Raising the bar for pasta sauces everywhere is this creamy tomato sauce that\'s been spiked with Absolut Vodka. It\'s simply super with the garlic-laden penne, prawns, sliced onion and cherry tomatoes.
Will be back to try the new Kaya French toast with coconut ice cream.
One of the new items that is being introduced in their revamped menu. No doubt it takes the place of the popular PB&amp;J French Toast (I am allergic to peanuts), but that means I can finally have a taste of their French Toast. The toast was soft, moist and tasty with the eggy batter; a real delight when you cut it with the knife as its really pillowy. The Kaya infuses a coconut-y flavour, which is well complimented with the aromatic coconut flakes and the fragrant coconut ice-cream. Despite having butter filled within the stuffed french toast, it felt not a wee bit greasy as well. Something I will definitely go for again!
I don\'t usually find myself liking croissants, especially if they come with fillings. This one was nice though; the croissant was light, flaky and buttery with generous servings of thin roasted beef fillet that was melt-in-the-mouth, creamy scrambled eggs and ample vegetables to make it feel less sinful.
Artistry serves coffee made from blends of my favourite local roaster by far, Liberty Coffee. Their coffee is smooth and creamy, and was nutty with a medium body; the signature flavour profile of Liberty\'s blends.
Kudos to the Artistry people for taking the time to ask patrons for feedback and constantly working to better their food. I feel like this has made them one of the casual caf√©s in Singapore with the best food. They have replaced the PB&amp;J french toast with Kaya Butter French toast topped with coconut ice cream, a ballsy move if you ask me considering the former was a mega hit. While the latter was rich and decadent, i\'ll miss their unique and signature PB&amp;J offering. I also really enjoyed the crab burger, the patty of which was chockfull of crabmeat (not from crabstick!), topped with a sharp but sweet relish. That said, the nasi lemak burger went down not as well. I would return for the food as i keep up my support for food creators who work hard at bettering their craft, rather than those who sell themselves solely on presentation, location and d√©cor.
Ordered this while just casually chilling out with a group of friends who were looking for a drink around the area. My first try on a cocktail was a decent one; this Rum Chendol caught my attention being a locally-infused mix made up of a top layer of both Black and White Rum, followed by a layer of a Coconut Cream and then Gula Melaka, topped off with red beans. The Gula-Melaka gave it a nice coconut-ish sweetness, while the coconut cream gave it a pandan-like taste, which was pretty intriguing when mixed with rum as it felt different yet familiar. Daring mix of local flavours into a cocktail, which would be delightful for the adventurous.
If you are less adventurous, skip the rest of the cocktails to have the Longan Cobbler, which despite being doused with various gins and angosutra, has its strong alcoholic flavours balanced off perfectly with the sweetness of Longans and syrup.
Back here (yes, again) for their fail-safe creamy and silky smooth scrambled eggs. I am glad to hear that this is staying on the menu even as the chef introduces new items this August. Whew!
Just look at this pbj french toasts, with the vanilla ice cream and jam leaking down soaking into the toasts filled with peanut butter, it\'s soft and moist with blissfulness üòçüò™ lunch time is still far from now..
What I like for my pasta, pesto and linguine!! The crushed pine nuts makes the dish even more fragrant. Gonna come back again once they launched the kaya french toasts and nasi lemak burger!
Although nothing spectacular it was very good and comforting in a nice way.
Great, warm service and quite a pleasant spin on the tired French toast-for-breakfast idea. 
Crab lovers alert! Look no further the response to your crab crave is here. This is really a burgerliscious creation, generous patty of crab meat with sweet onion dressing sandwiched by 2 squid ink buns. Love their buns, firm, almost crispy surface and doesn\'t flatten out when we devour your burger.
For once, the hype is real. This piece of Windowsill Pie is truly as good as what\'s been said about it. I really like the incredibly light texture of its fragrant banana-scented filling. Something tells me I\'ll be ordering this quite often from now on.
Had my first taste of the Lime Vodka Windowsill Pie today and I liked it. It\'s intensely zesty and light. I can understand why it is beloved by those who don\'t possess a sweet tooth, and have a preference for a refreshing desserts.
try their truffle and cajun fries. they\'re really good. on a side note, weary work day today cuz of the thunderstorm outside and waking up for brazils humiliation
don\'t you wish every breakfast could be this yummy? we\'re taking life all too seriously.
The relationship between coffee and me is like a married couple who are always committed to each other.
Hot day. Cold latte. Sheer bliss :)
Yums
Incredibly rich, moist and had the perfect cake-to-frosting ratio. The zucchini bits added a nice bite to the fluffy sponge - this was really fantastic. Artistry does their cakes really well.
Nice and moist cake. Frosting had a wonderful consistency, but the tangy flavour of cream cheese didn\'t come through. To me, a true red velvet cake MUST come with a good tangy cream cheese frosting. So Artistry\'s version doesn\'t quite make the cut.
We arrived at around 4pm and there was no food left :\'( But there were still cakes and pies (from Windowsill Pies) so that was some consolation. We had a refreshing Key Lime Pie, which had a smooth and tart filling (but not cringe-inducing) concealing a surprise tequila jelly! The jelly tasted quite strongly of alcohol to me...then again I rarely drink. The cafe houses mini art exhibits, which I like, but the cafe is very packed both indoors AND outdoors, making it hard to find a table, much less enjoy the exhibition. So please come early, for the food and comfy seats!
This was awarded two thumbs-up by an American friend who lives and breathes carrot cake. A must-try if you like your carrot cakes light and moist with a touch of cinnamon.
Vegetarian Aglio Olio is often underrated cos it\'s vegetarian. But I can smell so much of the \'wok hei\'. So much love goes into this, even the capsicums are chargrilled. \n<br />The pink shit is Ribena (#notforsale). Good for hot days like these. #staffbenefits #artistryinsider
Tastemaker Veronica Phua puts it so aptly, \"Two thick yet lightly fluffy pancakes are so generously filled with blueberries and ricotta cheese bits, every mouthful is absolute heaven. As if that is not enough, three pieces of crisp bacon add a savory dimension to what is already wow\". Finish off with their wonderful coffee, and you\'ve got the perfect brunch. Sit outside if the weather is nice!
this could easily be one of the worst french toast we\'ve ever eaten. #looksprettyonly
Serving up something a little different tonight‚Ä¶ human treats for the opening of Clotilde Richalet\'s exhibition at Artistry. Pop by Artistry to find out the link üòâ Exhibition starts: 12/6/14 for 3 weeks‚Ä¶ not sure if these treats will be available though~
When an artist mix with coffee and pastries.. This place - Artistry is created! Nice look, deco with arts n paintings .. Serve great coffee with pie n cakes.. Ordered the grasshopper and choco fig w vanilla ice cream.. They are awesome and very nice !! Must try for all weekend-ers who want to just laze around in a cafe!
Cake can\'t hold its shape and too moist for my liking. Save calories &amp; money.. try their lemon poppy seed cake instead!
French toast with peanut butter and raspberry jam, drizzled with maple syrup and mixed berry compote, and a side of vanilla ice-cream. Are you salivating yet?
Get your veg on with this quirkily-named sarnie. Pressed between the warm toasted panini bread are sweet roasted peppers, fresh tomato and baby spinach - all mashed together in melting mozzarella. A mustard-mayo and piquant homemade onion-tomato relish (of which I had asked to have on the side) add a dash of pizzazz. If you like a light lunch, this would fit you to a T. 
Am always fascinated by how cafes customise their ordering and serving system. Love it when they stamp their individuality through quirky touches.
Cinnamon smell a lil\' too strong. Cake cannot hold its shape and too moist for my liking. Save your calories &amp; money and try their lemon poppy seed cake instead! 
So moist~ So good! The subtle crackling of the poppy seeds add texture to the cake! üëç
I never tire of coming to Artistry because I know the food and coffee never disappoints. Decided to try the pulled pork sandwich today and it was every bit as tasty as I\'d imagined. The moist and tender pork which had been shredded, has a sweetish taste. It went very well with the cheddar cheese, tomatoes, spinach and mayo that were all packed in with the pork between slices of toasted panini bread.
Arrived at 230pm and was told that most of the food was sold out. What was left was what I ordered which includes Belgium waffles with ice cream x PBJ French toast x granolas x latte x piccolo latte. Belgium waffles was way below expectations (üëé) but I guess the French toast made up for it (but still it doesn\'t satisfy) Granola was also pretty good and so was the coffee. Anyhoo, I\'ll still come back for the bacon ricotta blueberry pancakes or sth since it\'s the popular thanggggg 
Not my photo, but too cute not to share! Check out \"Makan Matters\" @ Artistry this weekend - an exhibition that explores Singapore\'s food obsession presented as a mix of products, visuals and art pieces. Runs till 25 May 2014. Selected items available for sale.

Hmmmm..... The flat white is good. üòã
The devilishly-calorie filled delight. I would come back here and marry the hell out of this French toast.
I thought Artistry would be a little quieter but it is so NOISY inside. I like looking at the photographs exhibited inside though. They serve soymilk for their coffee (yay!) which is a good contender for The Plain\'s coffee IMO. #burpple
You could be a blue blood about your crab cakes and insist on blue crab lumps, but when you\'re nowhere near the Chesapeake Bay, Artistry\'s crab burger can do you no wrong. It\'s a solid chunk of crustacean gold that\'s a fistful of hollas, lightly crumbed but not overwhelming so it\'s all crab all the time. The tomato chutney (so much onion, not crying about that) is a pleasant tinge while aioli stands in for remoulade (honestly, did not miss having that on board at all). This schooner sails between a squid ink bun that\'s crisp and light - the spotlight remains on the crab cake, which you can have and eat, too. Bonus points for a fulfilling serving of fries - pretend the Cajun seasoning is actually Old Bay. Price: $20 - on the high side for a burger, but not for one above the nonchalance of fast food, and certainly not for that volume of succulent crab.
Had to order this because the boyfriend said we go together like peanut butter and jam üòäüòäüòä
Bacon that doesn\'t taste like the usual bacon, sausage that doesn\'t taste like the usual sausage. Interesting. 
Truffle fries. Iced white. And awesome company. It\'s a good day! #sunday #brunch
Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake - Layered dark chocolate cake with peanut butter and chocolate frosting, and topped with Reese peanut buttercups. For limited* time only, come grab some before it\'s gone!
So glad to bump into fellow Tastemaker Veronica at Artistry, and had a nice chat with this gorgeous lady. 
I\'ve burppled about this before but it deserves an encore. How can I not rave once more about the sublime silkiness of their scrambled eggs? It beats me how do they get it so darn close to perfection again and again. Served with garlicky saut√©ed spinach, mushrooms and a slice of brioche, the portion is best described by Goldilocks: \"not too big, not too small but juuuust right\". 
Belgian waffles topped it off with vanilla ice cream (or honey &amp; fig), dusted with sugar icing and drizzled with berries compote. 
Yay for a chef who likes creating new dishes and a management that supports him. This new Creamy Salmon Linguine on the lunch menu has a uniquely tasty sauce. Creamy but having been tempered with fresh lemon juice, tomato confit, garlic and the underlying heat of chilli flakes, it\'s just darn yummy. Perfect with the salmon and cherry tomatoes. \n
You\'ll almost always get a perfect cup of coffee here. Order a roast beef or turkey ham ciabatta to go with it. Sit outside if the sun is kind!
Amazing atmosphere, great brunch menu but I was saving myself for the kebabs on Arab street. MUST GO BACK 
This is good!
Did you know it is illegal to sell poppy seeds in Singapore? But luckily, it isn\'t illegal to consume it because this cake wouldn\'t exist otherwise. And it needs to for a very good reason. Lemony and moist with the teensy crunch of hundreds of tiny poppy seeds, it is simply wonderful! Pile on that lemon curd if you want to dial up the zest factor.
Artistry Cafe has done it again. Working their special touch on a perennial brunch fave, the Eggs Benedict, they have made it uniquely theirs by serving wobbly poached eggs with the tenderest of braised beef cheeks. Preparation for the beef starts a day before, which explains its superb taste. I am seriously gobsmacked by how fantastically well it goes with the hollandaise sauce. Why didn\'t anyone think of this earlier?
#Coffee machine works, serving only coffee, cakes and pies... Haha no #frenchtoast for you @handsomehongrui \n<br />Ps, I drew the board again!
Cheese cakes w alittle rum tiramissu makes you dance under the blazing sun. Wooooo. 
Big Breakfast ($15) for Lunch at Artistry. Love the buttery scrambled eggs.

Pleasantly surprised to meet two wonderful fellow IGers in person today, at a cafe run by awesome folks. üòä\n<br />.
A double shot of espresso with a bit of milk. The aftertaste is clean with a meadow of dark, woody fragrance. 
Artistry\'s brand new weekday all-day breakfast menu has many tempting items, including this sweet concoction. It\'s essentially a brilliant take on a childhood favourite - the humble peanut butter and jam sandwich. A generous amount of PB &amp; J is slathered onto thick slices of brioche. These are then squished together and dipped in an egg batter before being fried to a nice crisp golden brown. This gives it that all-important light crunch in your mouth even though the French Toast comes smothered in maple syrup and a berries compote. Needless to say, the large scoop of vanilla ice-cream pulls everything together wondrously.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Presenting to you PB &amp;J Brioche French Toast ($14), one of Artistry\'s new weekday menu.
Cake is moist, coffee just about right 
Delightfully crisp waffles with lovely ice cream. 
This unique dish marries shredded chunks of delicious duck confit with pasta (you get your pick of penne, spagetti or linguine) in a garlicky pesto sauce. The few baby tomatoes peeking through, add a refreshing sweetness to the mix. 
Simple but very well done and presented. Two eggs done to your preference, are served with grilled button mushrooms and half a tomato, as well as a large piece of brioche toast and a beetroot salad. The iced chocolate is small but rich and chocolatey.
Coffees here are always, always amazing.
Friendly staff &amp; cosy ambience. The food was good too! BRB pancakes $10, red velvet cake $7 (can\'t rmb the pricing for the mocha, latte &amp; cappuccino.)
Veronica Phua puts it so aptly, \'Two thick yet lightly fluffy pancakes are so generously filled with blueberries and ricotta cheese bits, every mouthful is absolute heaven. As if that is not enough, three pieces of crisp bacon add a savory dimension to what is already wow\'. Finish off with their wonderful coffee, and you\'ve got the perfect brunch. Sit outside if the weather is nice! Photo by Veronica Phua.
| Artistry Crab Burger | $20 | The crab patty was great! Portion given was reasonable for its price | Recommended |
Sorry but the only way to do this crabcake burger justice is to show it half-eaten. Check out the chunks of crab meat inside that crunchy patty. I took off some of the sweet relish on top when eating because personally, I felt it overpowered the crab.
Killer combination of perfectly done beef patties with cheese and bacon make these sliders unforgettable. Especially with truffle fries as their partner in crime.
\nAn amazingly rich, powerful and intense cup. What great coffee is all about. 
Complimentary desserts on the house from the awesome folks at the Artistry. Thank you Prashant for the lovely surprise!
Best Lychee Martini cake ever in my list! Check out the Artistry cafe, if you haven\'t gotten your coffee and dessert fix! Happy TGIF!
A great cafe is one that prides itself on ensuring every cup of coffee is made with passion and perfection. Artistry is a fine example. 
My hunt for the best pancakes in Singapore ended here. Two thick yet lightly fluffy pancakes are so generously filled with blueberries and ricotta cheese bits, every mouthful is absolute heaven. As if that is not enough, three pieces of crisp bacon add a savory dimension to what is already wow. Get ready for your tastebuds to do a Mexican Wave.
Hard to find good coffee even in known caf√©.\n<br />But this place exceeded my expectation.
The taste was great, not too sweet and not the least bit bitter. I wouldn\'t change my choice, definitely a winner in my book. 
Lunch at The Artistry with my Duck confit pesto linguine. üçù

\"Prawns, spaghetti, cherry tomatoes, Parmesan, tossed with chilli padi-infused olive oil.\" $16.
For the chocolate lovers~
\"Jumbo lump crab, pan fried crisp-on-the-outside, moist-on-the-inside, served with chilli crab sauce and green mango salad\" Loved the clumps of crab meat in the patty! The black burger bun was delicious and definitely a change in presentation. Can\'t say much about the salad, wasn\'t much flavour apart from the raisins in there. But overall, I would order this again for the insane lumps of crab meat (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë) 
Beef pastrami with cherry jam in between beautiful tomato ciabatta bread
Generous chunks of crab meat on a soft squid ink bun. 
I would come back just for the Lemon Poppyseed Cake (and the ambience). Red velvet wasn\'t up to my standard; but it was unique how coconut flakes were used as toppings.
Love the green apple slices in the salad; adds so much sweetness and flavor to it.
Nice place to chill. 
One can never go wrong with a good flat white and windowsill pie. A shot of vodka in the vodka lime pie isn\'t enough to knock you out but enough to knock you over with glee. The vodka wasn\'t evenly distributed but I was glad it was done this way as I anticipated each bite hoping for a stronger vodka taste. Artistry is easily a cafe that I\'d frequent on weekdays.
Been a couple of time to Artistry and i can say I\'m a big fan of their tiramisu and red velvet cake. First time trying out their sandwich and I must say, it taste pretty good. Toasted bread (not an expert to identify the bread though) with  generous vegetables and roast beef. Good for a wholesome lunch if you are around that area.
Artistry is known for being a happening hotspot for arts events. It\'s where budding artists share their work, and aspiring artistes take the stage at night. This is probably the only cafe you could get service from a \"cute angmoh\" ; ) Remember to give him a pat on the back for his passion to support the local arts scene, and of course, for serving gorgeous cups of coffee.
Yummy Windowsill pies and decent coffee here .. nice place to chill with friends

I üíó every single element in this plate especially the flakey croissant that\'s been toasted to perfection. Such a perfect brunch to start the day! üòé
At first I thought of ordering a big breakfast kinda brunch set but decided on having this Sakura Shrimp Aglio Olio pasta (can\'t rmb the name of this dish). Reason being...I didn\'t know that üå∏Sakura Shrimp was this tiny Japanese Shrimp, so I thought there\'ll be flowers in my pasta! üôä \n<br />Anyways when the pasta came i just dived right into it cos I was starving! The pasta was so well flavoured, the pasta was well coated in the oil and the garlic was fragrant like how a good Aglio Olio should be! \n<br />What surprised me the most was the taste of my favourite pork lard (ba you po) in the dish!! I started poking üëâüèª around my pasta üçù but saw no fried pork lard üê∑. So I tasted the Sakura Shrimp and OMG YESSSSS, IT TASTED LIKE PORK LARD!! üòã \n<br />The prawn üç§ which was supposed to be the ‚≠êÔ∏è of the show (I think) didn\'t stand out as much as my discovery of the Sakura Shrimp. LOL! \n<br />Other ingredients like the black fungus have this fusion pasta goodness a good crunchy texture that wasn\'t too overpowering.

[Artistry SG]\n<br />.\n<br />√ñndeh Ondeh Hotcake\n<br />.\n<br />Tasted this plate of aesthetically plated Ondeh Ondeh Hotcake ($15), its perfectly round topped with pandan coconut ice cream! With a sort of old style bakery with extremely fluffly and flavourful ondeh ondeh and pandan hint!\n<br />.\n<br />The hidden gulua melaka syrup below the hotcake and the sprinkle of coconut flakes enhanced the overall presentation and most importantly, its taste! Would definitely come back for this!
[Artistry]\n<br />.\n<br />Cream Chicken\n<br />.\n<br />Tasted this creamy Chicken ($20)! Pasta was topped with chicken cubes with dried chilli, cashew nuts, scallions, shaoxing wine, ginger and curry leaves! Accompanied with their gourmet sandwiches Triple Cheese ($12), brushed with sundried tomatos!
This is the bomb!

Thanks to the two guys who graciously took my order. \n<br />As good as the place may be, they are things that may be improved.  To the lady with the top bun, if you\'re having a bad day, it may be best to hibernate until you\'re with a gracious and a happy demeanour to face your customers. Customers don\'t deserve to deal with your grumpiness and bitchy attitude.  Do keep in mind that It\'s also through customers that you make business.  A word of advise, please smile when people say thanks. Do acknowledge and be respectful.  Pls do not follow customers a with a stare if you don\'t like them. I do hope you\'re not the owner of this place as that is not a good way to lead by example.  I have recommended artistry to a number of visiting friends but it would be with reservations from now onwards. \n<br />Artistry, Jalan Pinang, Singapore

There is something strangely satisfyingly dipping the perfectly toasted bread, taking a mouthful of the sauce mixed with cottage cheese which melts lovingly into it.

Done the Artistry way. Cafe\'s open and serving out brunch till 3pm today.
Not a bad brunch but limited choices in their menu.
Our potato hash and scrambled eggs comes with kale charred in olive oil. Kale is known to have anti-oxidant and cancer preventive qualities. So here\'s to brunch without (much) guilt.
So pop in for a chill night at Artistry.
Available till 9pm tonight. #foodporn #tgif #cafe #cafesg #burpple #openricesg image: @emilywjteng
Craving for an Artistry Chilli crab burger? Available till 9pm tonight.
We\'ve been serving out brunch since 9am. Tonight, at 8pm, we host the launch of Daphne Tan\'s EP, \"Where No One Is\". The Mad Hatters Project will open. Gonna be a fun and casual night. Dinner served till 9pm. Cocktails and bar bites till 11pm.

A beautiful day for brunch. We are serving up our specialities, including this Potato Hash with scrambled eggs, charred kale and bacon till 3pm before a bunch of us head down to @pinkdotsg this evening.
I can\'t breathe without scrambled eggs, maybe.
Surprise flavors and definitely should try!
Those who love tomatoes will love it, good flavors
PB&amp;J french toast with scoop of vanilla ice cream. Delish! The bread was so soft, with PB in the middle and the jam and vanilla. Sweet but worth the sugar rush. Slightly overpriced at $14.
üò´ Actually most of the items were sold out when we reached. üòÇ Well, at least we still had a good piece of red velvet cake and coffee!‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª

Thank you @burpple for the party! #burppletastemakers
A cup of Gibraltar to start the burpple eatup. Gibraltar is a latte with less milk. Perfect for those that prefer a stronger coffee taste. (Though I would prefer my coffee slightly more acidic)
Merry Christmas to all Burpplers. Happy Burppling away!
Burppling with the #BurppleTastemakers on a Friday night! Thanks for organizing the Christmas party, it was a blast to meet everyone :)
Pick me up! Pick me up!
Very much a temptress, so bring a buddy and designated driver. 4.25/5
Plum acidity and notes of dark chocolate. Try it as an alternative to our speakeasy blend.

Lazy breakfast day at Artistry.
Don\'t forget to ask for the Affordable Art Fair preview or Arty-Licious Evening invites when you lunch at Artistry!

Great place to chill out and have cakes and tea or coffee!
My duck confit croissant is ever so delicious!

$7. Small but whoaaaa. If you like tiramisu with strong alcohol content then this is it, with the usual creamy mascarpone. Is it possible to get tipsy on tiramisu?
Love the peanut butter üò∏
A bit pricey, but the food is good. 
Another lunch option from our weekday menu! Kitchen operates from 10am to 4pm.

It\'s been 2 great nights of the Live Looping Festival. We are back serving brunch from 10am to 4pm today.

Restoring Balance.\n<br />.
This cheesecake looks all virginal when on display. But do not, for even one second, be deceived. Prior to being served, it undergoes a glam makeover. What appears before you is a seductive, knowing thing, beckoning with the alluring charms of textural play. The smoothness of the silky, tofu-like cheesecake and the gooey sweetness of the caramel sauce are beautifully played up when contrasted with the crunchy base and chopped up roasted cashew nuts. One bite of this and you are lost.
