☺️You can expect STRONG but not overly sweet flavours!\n<br />Sometimes, I don\'t like to read/ask about what\'s inside the kakigori so that I get a nice surprise 😁 In this case, I love the ingredients inside! 😍😋\n<br />Hope to have this again by end of the week before their menu changes  again!
Double Kinako Kakigori ($15.90)\n<br />.\n<br />@Matchayasg is serving up their latest seasonal kakigori pairing 2 of my favourite japanese dessert ingredients together, kuromitsu and kinako! Kinako cream sauce is generously applied atop the kakigori whilst the kinako powder is dusted onto the kakigori to dangerous levels risking inhalation😂! After digging for gold in the Kakigori, one would hit the jackpot kuromitsu ice cream (a collab with Tom’s Palette). Rich and creamy, the ice-cream paired really well with the icy dessert. Lavish kuromitsu sauce is also served on the side to further enchant Matchaya’s fans. I only wish there were less icy chunks in the kakigori as it may have marred my 2nd kakigori experience here. Only about 3 more days to go for anyone who wants to have a go at this!
One of my favourite things from Matchaya - their roll cakes! I was left feeling rather indifferent when I had their Matcha Roll Cake the last time, but the Houjicha ($5.00) flavour managed to elicit a smile.
This towering cup comes with a drizzle of Kuromitsu sauce and a Kinako espuma sprinkled with Kinako powder. For those who are fond of this roasted soy flour, this decadant ice blended beverage is unequivocally a godsent. Personally, this beverage was likable enough to convert me from a sceptic to a believer of a kinako-based beverage.
Matchaya’s Seasonal Double (x2) Kinako Kuromitsu Kakigori is my new love (so guud i tell you)! A mighty heap of Japanese shaved ice capped with a thick handmade Kinako cream sauce, Kinako powder, and if that wasn’t enough an extra dose from Tom’s Palette’s Kinako Kuromitsu ice cream layered in between. Be still my heart!
Genmaicha works well in any form! This is topped with Hokkaido milk espuma and roasted rice. Hidden inside is lots of azuki beans 😁 \n<br />Catch it before the menu changes on Monday 😋 And don\'t you think today\'s weather is perfect for this? 🌞
DO NOT GET THE WARABI MOCHI! It tastes so bad.  The texture is NOT the same as the authentic ones in Japan. It feels like a hybrid of jelly. It actually tastes bitter due to the overwhelming matcha coating. And the matcha syrup was just gross and juvenile. The shiratama was bad too. Why is this POS item even a limited time special ??? A HUGE waste of $9.90 and I\'m really mad.
Rich Hojicha tea flavor (S$5.90), which I prefer it over matcha.
Top up $1 &amp; you can choose between having them as separate individual layers, or twist them together to create a beautiful delicious swirl of tea flavours! Or if 2 flavors is too much for you, you can just choose 1 out of the 4 flavors available daily!
Still one of my favourite softserves around that never fails to put a big smile on my face as I enjoy the creamy, thick, rich flavours of hojicha\n<br />📍@matchayasg, The Cathay #01-08
Especially loved the melt-in-your-mouth mochi and toasted rice puffs 😋\n<br />#burpple #matchayasg
Not a personal favourite, purely due to a matter of preference, but looking at it objectively, the Houjicha Softserve ($5.50) from Matchaya does have its share of merits.
Usucha is a thiner, lighter bodied Tea in comparison to Koicha 濃茶 (in which Matchaya also offers) that is intense, robust &amp; full bodied. The difference in thickness is due to the amount of matcha &amp; water used in preparing matcha. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />茶道 (The Way of Tea) : Matcha powder can be categorized at different grades of matcha depending on its quality.\n<br />It is said that usucha can be prepared from any grade of matcha; of course, the flavor differs from grade to grade. \n<br />On the other hand, koicha can only be prepared with matcha that is above a certain level of quality.\n<br />This is because a lower grade matcha creates strong bitterness &amp; astringency.\n<br />Originally, matcha served in tea ceremony was koicha. 🖖🏻
Swipe to view the different components that constitute this seasonal parfait. The top layer of Hokkaido milk softserve was smooth, creamy and milky, specked with lavender petals. The ichigo (frozen strawberries) were icy and tangy, berry sour but refreshing! Lavender gelato was creamy, thick with a lingering and aromatic floral fragrance ; personally prefer the softserve version for a smoother and softer texture. Milk pudding was firm albeit wobbly, a pretty mild flavour that was enhanced by the tangy homemade berry sauce. Matcha granola and toasted rice puffs were a pleasant addition that provided a crunch factor to the other softer components. Really love this combination where every element was an enjoyable and significant contribution for both the sight and sense! 😍😋💜💜\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
🍦\n<br />•\n<br />Sometimes people don\'t treasure things until when it\'s gone. Just like this Matcha Popsicle from Matchaya. So much so that... 🍵\n<br />•\n<br />Dear Matchapop (yes I gave it a nickname), I hope you are doing well, wherever you are even though I know that you are now nowhere. I, or I mean we miss you. \n<br />Sorry for not showing you much love &amp; appreciation when you are with us. \n<br />But we secretly pray that you can make a comeback once in awhile, don\'t have to be temporary (I know it\'s quite a hassle) but do Pop by once in awhile.

As it turns out, these Japanese milk tea specialists are great at churning ice cream (from $5.90) too. The classic Matcha Soft Serve here is perfect for those who like their ice cream bittersweet and intensely flavoured with green tea — not for the faint-hearted, that\'s for sure! Consider pairing it with the irresistible Hokkaido Milk Soft Serve; it had Burpple Tastemaker Zul Latiff smitten with its milky creaminess. To make things even more epic, we love to add a Goma Shot ($2), an intense, delicious shot of thick black sesame that really enhances the Hokkaido milk flavour. If you like roasted tea flavours, the Houjicha Soft Serve is the perfect mix of toasty and velvety. There are toppings to add on but if it\'s your first time, we recommend savouring the soft serve sans embellishments. Pro tip: Burpplers who work in the CBD can pop by their other outlet at Icon Village in Tanjong Pagar. Perfect for a post-lunch treat!\n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Cassandra Chew
Unfortunately it\'s over but fret not because there\'s always special surprises awaiting ahead! 💚💖 Thanks @matchayasg for reserving this last set for me, after having 2 unlucky failed trips prior to this! 😅 Swipe once to view the identity of each individual element that constitutes this tea set and swipe to the end to view my favourite elements. Advised by the staff to consume the kuki tea jelly first and drink  the ichiban tea as they were ones with a lighter flavour profile. True enough, the tea jelly was light with a faint earthy note and the ichiban tea was a clear and light one too! Moving on, the houjicha roll cake was soft, fluffy and sufficiently moist, with a core of houjicha cream that was smooth, light and airy. The houjicha flavour was mildly distinct but still the spongy, pillowy texture provided great satisfaction to the palate. Would personally prefer if there\'s less cream and more sponge cake though! Houjicha pudding, on the other hand, was topped with espuma that resembled a lightly sweetened whipped cream with light and foamy texture that melts in the mouth. The pudding was smooth, with a soft, wobbly texture that had a more distinct roasted flavour as compared to the Swiss roll. The characteristic roasted flavour was also further enhanced with drizzles of the thick houjicha sauce lying at the base of the pudding. Houjicha warabi mochi was coated with a substantial amount of houjicha powder, bringing out a distinct earthy roasted flavour with a soft, chewy texture. As one who doesn\'t fancy azuki, I decided to skip that element and moved on to my ultimate favourite - houjicha softserve 💛💛. The smooth, creamy texture that came with the most distinct roasted flavour and lingering aroma! As for the tea, a 2nd flush (banchan) is provided after you are done with the first which had a more robust roasted earthy flavour with a thicker concentration. Really really fancy  this tea set that I decided to be selfish and have it all to myself 😂Hopefully there would be a matcha version in the near future? 💚😉
💚💚💚 The matcha flavour of the ganache was distinctive with a pleasant earthy note, with a striking resemblance to my favourite O\'sulloc matcha milk jam spread 💚. Texture was a tad too thick for my liking, personally felt that it could have been toned down for dipping purposes otherwise it\'s akin to consuming a jam spread. The matcha brownies (finally got to try!!😋) were fudgy and sufficiently moist, with a luscious chocolatey note. The layer of matcha flavoured brownie could have been more distinct in terms of flavour though. Shiratama and the buttered toasts were a complementary pairing to the thick matcha ganache whereas the other elements were better off consuming in silo - but of course, with the matcha ganache, its double the pleasure and enjoyment 😋 Matcha warabi mochi was soft and chewy, coated with a substantial amount of matcha powder that provided a pleasant bitter undertone. Coupled with a cup of matcha softserve that\'s smooth, creamy and retaining a consistent standard of distinctive earthy flavour, a cup of hot steamed milk is also served after you are done consuming all the elements. Mix the hot milk with the remaining matcha ganache fondue to create your hot own matcha latte! 🍵Can\'t wait to try the houjicha fondue next time 😋😋.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Ventured away from my usual matcha (and mystery flavour because we weren\'t at ICON) and tried the Hokkaido milk and houjicha mix ($1). The Hokkaido milk was creamy but not too rich or sweet - great for the milk lover. The houjicha though, that was a winner for me. Roasty and smoky 🤤. Also we got the extra rice puffs ($1.50) and upsized it ($2) to share.
A nutty and refreshing number, the fluffy texture of the ice was certainly coarser if compared to the usual Korean shaved ice but the unique consistency had the robust goma sauce weaved subtly into the layers. And diggin’ the soft, airy and light Hokkaido cream espuma; there just wasn’t enough to go around. That extra drizzle of goma sauce, courtesy of Co-owner Kevin was the icing on the cake.
Really yummy and the green tea taste is really heavy which I loveeeee! The thick creamy ice cream and the bitter sweet matcha really makes my day! It\'s a little pricey but once in awhile it\'s good to indulge. The seats are a little uncomfortable and the male staff looks annoyed and didn\'t talk much but the ice cream is still bomb 👌🏻
It\'s great to have friends to share triple flavored ice cream when u can\'t decide which individual ice cream you want. Recommend the classic rich matcha and Hokkaido milk soft serve! Roasty Houjicha ice cream is too heavy for me. It\'s topped with azuki beans, rice crisp, shiratama and jap biscuit. Yums!
Hojicha and matcha soft serve was really good, especially the hojicha\'s fragrance! Value for money and probably one of the best hojicha soft serve in SG
Triple-flavoured Bowl, because three is always better than one.
Triple-flavoured Bowl, because three is always better than one.
Interviewed the people behind Matchaya for some school thing before (they were nice and super patient with us), that was last year when they were selling tea powder at a farmer\'s market. Fast forward to now and they have two branches already! This place really deserves all the love and more. Love the deep, roasty flavours of all the ice creams; each has a different profile that you think it\'s the best already, until you taste another one and fall in love again IM IN LOVE ❤️ (add the black sesame sauce for extra intense flavour, it\'s like having 芝麻糊 but even better)
Matcha, Houjicha &amp; Sesame soft serve with Azuki, Shiratama, Rice Puffs &amp; Cookie Stick 》$12.90
Finally tried out the highly raved about Matcha Soft Serve here. While the ice cream was rich and creamy, we didn\'t like that the green tea notes bordered slightly on being too bitter on its own and subsequently decided to add red beans for an additional dollar. Would definitely consider a return trip, but perhaps Hojicha would be a better choice next time.
Matchaya has significant social media support - most posts from their foodie and instagrammer friends are unwaveringly loyal and positive - and it is not difficult to understand why, considering they play the Instagram aesthetic game to a T and provide offerings of a perennially well-received nature (i.e. Japanese and green tea).
Hokkaido Milk Softserve with Goma Shot ($10)
Matcha // Black Sesame // Houjicha
Koicha  「濃茶」 - literally meaning thick tea, it comes from the first harvest of tea leaves. The vibrant green colour is due to the boost in chlorophyll levels from growing under the shade. 
🍦\n<br />•\n<br />Oh Magnum, you got nothing on this. The Cha Cha Pop, which is a collaboration done with @nehnehpopsg is phasing out soon?! (Dear Matcha God, Why?!) 🍵\n<br />A Bitter-Sweet ending, Bitter that is the Matcha, balanced with the Sweetness of the Black Molasses &amp; hints of Fragrance the Houjicha provides, Harmoniously Ends the great run of this Cha Cha Neh Neh Pop. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: Down to what I believe is around a dozen Creamsicle left, &amp; if you haven\'t tried it, I\'m sorry to say that this just might be your last chance. 🏵\n<br />So head down to @matchayasg The Cathay &amp; Icon Village Outlets to grab them while stock lasts, before they melt away. 🖖🏻
Down to probably their last dozen, Matchaya’s dual-coloured Magnum lookalike will soon be phasing out.
For those who don\'t know, their Cha Cha Pop ($8) is a collab done with the people behind @nehnehpopsg! I\'m not usually a fan of matcha, but I must say that this has got me inching towards changing my mind 😬 
We headed over to Matchaya @ Cathay after our 🍔 dinner ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀🍴 We got the 3 Colours parfait($12.90) and Cha cha pop($7.90). Point to note is that Cha cha pop is phasing out soon! Like prob less than 20 left, so hurry down to Cathay to get your last few pops ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀🍴 Cha cha pop is one of my favourite flavours out of the neh neh pop series for its great combi of matcha and goma crunchy exterior and bittersweet matcha w red bean inside 🤤 Well all good things come to an end (till the next big thing I hope) haha ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀🍴 As for the 3 colour parfait, the flavours we got were houjicha, matcha and goma. They need no introduction and are as creamy and delicious as ever. But only pity is, instead of the bigger rounder adzuki beans, they used the smaller more elongated Chinese red rice bean. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Would have preferred adzuki beans, but that\'s just me. 😅 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀🍴 Thanks to @ahkemas for channeling his inner Jackson pollock, @vanessa_kou for holding the cha cha pop w her pretty fingers, @alhsx for leaving more matcha for us to eat  and all of you guys for the company tonight 🙆🏻🙆🏻🙆🏻 🍴\n<br />#burpple #matchaya #softserve #sgfood #dessert #stfoodtrending
🍡\n<br />•\n<br />Just like a Kaiseki meal, there are sequence to this Fondue. Start by having the Shiratama/Dango Balls to the Brûléed Toast, Brownies &amp; Biscuits then end if all off with the Warabi Mochi (which is more chewy to pair it with the Fondue) Basically, just work your way clockwise as plated. 🍵\n<br />.\n<br />White Chocolate, Matcha Powder, a dollop of Love &amp; Passion is the foundation of the Fondue thus the thick Better-Sweet consistency. A big thank you to @kevincheejy of @matchayasg for adding Espuma on our Fondue! 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: Hot milk is served after you finish the Fondue, it acts like a palate cleanser &amp; a harmonious ending. @kevincheejy recommended us to add some of the Matcha Fondue to the Hot Milk which turns out to be Heavenly. 🤤\n<br />Be prepared to wait for approx. 15 mins as Everything is made upon Order from scratch hence the waiting time (This clearly shows the commitment to Freshness &amp; Quality which I Respect) 🏵
If you like stronger matcha flavour which isn\'t too sweet, you\'ll definitely not be disappointed by Matchaya. I also love how they have the unique flavour of hojicha which is refreshing and really good too! It\'s also great that they serve warabimochi! Damage done: 12?
Had their Matcha Soft Serve ($5.90) for the second time within the last week and can see myself going back to this place again... and again... and again... SO GOOD!! But defo not for those who prefer the sweeter renditions as their Matcha here leans more towards the natural bitter taste. Had the hojicha one the previous time but still prefer the original Matcha flavour 😊
Finally got to try Matchaya after hearing so much about it! We got the cup that included more ingredients ($10.50) because we wanted to try their toppings. I really liked the overall matcha flavour because it had that bitter after taste and it\'s not too sweet. The toppings were good but I\'m not crazy about mochi so I think I would go for a plain cup next time if I get it again. Would really recommend Matchaya if you don\'t like your ice cream too sweet! I preferred this to Nana\'s but my mother still prefers Nana because the texture is much softer and the flavour is not as rich.
Tasted interestingly more bitter than the usual green tea soft serve. Especially with the matcha sauce at the top of the soft serve and crunch in the middle. The place is also structured more like \"bar counter\" seats.
Addictive molten matcha madness designed for one, Matchaya’s Matcha Fondue ($16.90) is certainly good to share between two to three matcha lovers.
〰 $7.40
Houjicha Soft Serve ($8 for large portion with warabi mochi topping at $1.5) — I\'d say go for the soft serve and skip the toppings!
$10.90 | slightly more expensive than Tsujiri, and I still prefer tsujiri after eating this.
It took me way too long to hop on the Matchaya bandwagon, but I finally got around to trying it last Friday! 😛
Texture is rather fluffy and the Uji Matcha sauce is ohhhh so good and gao! I\'ve eaten bingsu that only drenches the TOP with sauce but at matchaya, even the last bit is soaked in this awesome sauce 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Apparently a lot of hard work went into creating this such as the perfect temperature, using filtered Japanese water, tt foamy cream espuma. Well done guys!
.
Black Sesame Kakigoru ($18.90)
Finally tried their kakigori, but I must say, I left kinda confused...
🍴\n<br />Back for my favourite houji cha soft serve! This is what hunger does to you, unwilling to try new things and just want your old comfort. But why do they keep trying to upsell me for upsize and toppings?!? 😜 One small cup alr so expensive (and I alr paid more for mixed flavour), I can\'t afford toppings and upsize! 😩😩😩😩 #burpple #softserve #sgfood #houjicha #goma #matchaya
I\'m obsessed with Warabi Mochi!!! It\'s very different from the regular glutinous rice mochi that is more widely available and sold at most places. The texture is slightly chewy, but it can melt in your mouth after a few bites. I liked both their flavours, but I\'ll recommend the Kinako for those who prefer the more traditional and sweeter version. If you like more bitter flavours, get their Matcha flavoured Kinako. (But if your indecisive like me, just get both!)
Favourite dessert spot currently in Singapore. I literally rave about this place to all my friends. One of a kind kakigori here because we were the last to get the Sakura 😂 The owners here are sooooo friendly, and Kevin came to tell us about their kakigori, which they took months to craft and perfect. (Go down and have a chat with them, they\'ll be more than happy to explain everything to you! ☺️) Their kakigori is like a cross between traditional ice kachang and Korean Bingsu, although personally think it\'s a whole new level of shaved ice. The texture of the ice is so fluffy and perfect, and when paired with the  Hokkaido Sakura cream Espuma, Houjicha sauce, shiratama, azuki and brownies, it was mindblowingly good. Nothing was over-cloying and all the flavours gelled together really well. Just take my money!
I am spoilt for choice! I\'ve difficulty in choosing... in the end i had this matcha parfait ($10.90) with azuki beans, crunchy toasted rice crispies and dango. Matcha softserve is smooth, thick, creamy and lingering bitterness taste on the palate that i like. Yumz~\n<br />•\n<br />Mmm, i need another cup of parfait please? 😋💚\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple
The matcha soft serve managed to maintain its bitter integrity without straying too far from the local and commercial OB markers for green tea soft serves, whilst elsewhere the brownie was happily moist and the toasted rice puffs added crunchy, chimney-esque char to the proceedings. The pricing is more Holland V than Ang Mo Kio, though. 3.8/5
I\'m love these.. just like how intense their soft serves are, these macarons are also richer in the taste of tea and flavours. They\'re thus not as sweet so the highlight is on the authenticity of the flavours here.\n<br />🔸\n<br />They have six flavours - Matcha, Houjicha, Yuzu, Nama Chocolate, Lychee Rose, Black Sesame, and my favourite is the Houjicha for that strong roasted fragrance.
Best matcha I\'ve had so far 🍵 and a great pairing with the Hokkaido flavoured soft serve as well 😋
They\'ve finally opened in town; there\'s a seating area and new items on the menu (eyeing the fondues!!!). When the sweltering weather gets you down, go for the Matcha Kakigori ($18.90) with specially sourced ingredients resulting in a delightfully refreshing dessert. Dig into the mountain of delicate fluffy ice and you\'ll find hidden shiratama, brownies and azuki beans; topped with light, hokkaido cream espuma, drizzled with more matcha sauce!
The fav dessert spot\'s now open in Cathay with a whole bunch of new items (think fondues (!!!), warabi mochi, etc.) up on the menu, plus a pretty seating space! Here\'s the Matcha Kakigori, each served with super light and fluffy Hokkaido cream espuma (best part), matcha sauce, chewy shiratama, azuki &amp; brownies with shaved filtered Japanese water. They also have this in Houjicha and Goma (black sesame). It was enjoyable and super refreshing especially on a hot day, but thought the ice could be even smoother. The price tag\'s really quite painful to the wallet, so grab a few friends to share!

First time trying the extended menu (there\'s so much new things to try - think matcha fondue?? Kinako mochi 😍). I got the houjicha parfait and it was really so so good. From the rich roasted tea taste &amp; smooth texture of the soft serve to the pairing of Azuki, rice crackers &amp; jelly, each bite made me smile a little more. Thankful for the easier access now &amp; can\'t wait to be back for more! ⭐️ 5/5 ⭐️\n<br />📍@matchayasg, The Cathay #01-08
That means you no longer have to travel all the way to tanjong pagar for your matcha fix. By pure chance that we witnessed their soft launch.

Kakigori is one example, rarely you see tourists hunting down for it compared to some overrated Soft Serve, Sushi or Ramen. 🍧\n<br />.\n<br />Some might view this as selfish some might view this as an insiders world to the kaleidoscopic culinary offerings Japan has yet to share with the world. But why not view it this way, if you really love something with a passion no matter what gets in your way, you’ll eventually work your arse to get to it. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />Don’t you realise that when you make an extra effort to get to know/learn/make a cuisine that’s foreign to your own, the locals feel a level of appreciation &amp; respect. Which in turn, welcome you with open arms to the culinary secrets/offerings they have to offer. 🏵\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #きなこ #Kuromitsu #黒蜜 #Kakigori #かき氷 #SugarCakePie #Matchayasg #Matchaya #おいしい

The black sesame ice-cream was amazingly rich and creamy, with an especially robust black sesame flavour. Will be back for more!
The Roasted Fragrance Nuttiness of the Kinako is nicely balanced with the sweetness from the syrup.

The mixture of the Bittersweet Matcha &amp; Roasted fragrance of Hojicha blends so well together. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />In the Parfait, you get treats like; from the bottom - Tea Jelly, Soft Serve, Rice Puffs, then Soft Serve, Azuki Red Beans, Soft Serve again, topped with Shiratama Balls &amp; a Langues de Chat. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker  #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #matchaya #matchayasg #ほうじ茶 #抹茶 #matcha #hojicha #softserve #sugarcakepie #parfaits #shiratama #おいしい

Still prefer the houjicha which is sweet but with bitter undertones giving depth to the flavour 😋\n<br />•\n<br />#sgeats #sgfood #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodsg #foodporn #foodblogger #foodphotography #matchayasg #softserve #burpple #hungrygowhere
Throwback dessert
the soft serve was damn good????
👍🏻4/5\n<br />📍The Cathay #yybffdhobyghaut
Rice puffs in the middle that provide the much needed crunch with Hojicha Soft Serve in between the different layers of ingredients. 🥄\n<br />You\'ll find Azuki red beans, Brownies &amp; Shiratama at the top &amp; Hojicha sauce as the final icing on the Parfait. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: The price might be slightly steeper than its counterparts but I can Ensure you that the quality is of paramount here. If you do order this, I\'d recommend to have it take away, the portion look &amp; is slightly bigger compared to Dining it in. *Wink Wink 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sugarcakepie #matchayasg #matchaya #hojicha #matcha #softserve #icecream #parfait #brownies #mochi #shiratama #azuki

matcha &amp; kinako, served with kuromitsu
It also comes together with rice puffs, azuki beans, butter biscuit &amp; mochi balls (my fav!!).

Warabi mochi ; unlike mainstream mochi these were much palatable!

The matcha softserve struck a beautiful balance between sweet and bitter hence it was a great match when eaten together..\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple

It\'s slightly more bitter than most matcha soft serves that I have tried - but I find the bitterness very appealing 👍🏼 .\n<br />(Or maybe just because it\'s matcha 🙃#MatchaFanForever)

HOJICHA KAKIGORI [$18.90]. Price tag was a killer, BUT guys it\'s 💥 if you\'re a fan of the Hojicha Frapp from Starbucks like me. I hail this is the ATAS VERSION of it! 😌😙 Taste: 4.5/5 \n<br />Loved the light airy whipping cream Espuma on top — made from pure Hokkaido milk. I hate whipped cream and yet this was on another level! The ice also sent my Friend and I to cloud 9 cus it was so fluffy! Very different from the usual bingsu or Chinese shaved ice because it melts in the mouth! \n<br />As a baker myself, I know that quality matters in delivering a sustainable product &amp; I\'m happy to see it shine through in this particular dessert. Keep it up team @matchayasg! \n<br />One thing that we both agreed on was how the 🍫 brownie was out of place since it was alone and cold underneath the mountain. Was also looking for more red bean than shiratama hehe 😆 \n<br />Perhaps the brownie could be placed at the side or sticking out on TOP? 😄 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#matchalover #matchalovers #matchaholic #matchacafe #greentealover #greenteaicecream #matchaicecream #openricesg #dessertable #dessertcafe #ujimatcha #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #sgcafehop #burpple #burpplesg #hungrygowheresg #kinako #warabimochi #matchaparfait #greenteaparfait #blacksesame
It\'s a little powdery and the sweetness just touches and go on your taste buds.
personal favorite is still the hojicha!!
$10.90
For people like me who cannot make up their mind 😌
@MatchayaSg has open a sophomore outlet @ the heart of @OrchardRoad.Sg in the hipster enclave known as The Cathay! Grab a dessert before your movies or vice versa. Oh they\'ve got legit seating now too. Do look out for the new offering oso yah.\n<br />~\n<br />In frame\'s the Kinako Kuromitsu ($9.9) but +$1 for two mixed flavor (we\'d Matcha + Goma)!\n<br />~\n<br />Pic taken @MatchayaSg\n<br />2 Handy Road\n<br /># 01-08\n<br />The Cathay\n<br />Singapore 229233\n<br />Operating Hours: Sun - Thu\n<br />1pm - 10pm\n<br />Fri/Sat\n<br />1pm - 11pm\n<br />Facebook: https:/https://www.facebook.com/matchayasg\n<br />Website: https://www.matchaya.sg\n<br />Email: info@matchaya.sg\n<br />~
A bigger space with sitting area. A menu with old and new items.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Spoilt for choice... I had difficulty in deciding. So in the end, I had this matchaya softserve with rice puffs, red beans and 2 mochi (I already ate it). There are usual flavors like the black sesame, hojiucha. From what I saw on the menu, there is also fondue which is not available at the moment.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />I say it with joy that finally I could sit and \"matchaya\" slowly slowly. Congrats @kevincheejy @myfoodsirens @matchayasg on the opening of your 2nd outlet.
