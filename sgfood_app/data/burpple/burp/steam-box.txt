😊 Healthy because everything here is steamed with minimal/no salt and seasoning added. 👌🏻 Food is steamed really quickly (bet 2-6mins) and I like how they use coloured plates to indicate how long the food should be steamed for the best tasting. So don\'t need to worry about under/over-steaming!😋👌🏻
@steamboxsg \n<br />This is a different way of enjoying ‘steamboat’. Food is cooked by high-speed steaming, ready in 2-6 minutes.

Steam box is the latest concept using the latest steaming technology. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #steamboxsg #hotpot #steamboat
Time to let out some steam after a long week. Why not check out the latest steam potting concept at Serangoon Garden. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #steamboxsg #seafood #steampot #steambox
Diners get to cook their own dim sum. You don\'t get to experience it elsewhere.
Other than the more hip interior, the quality of its ingredient didn\'t match up to that of the latter, whether in the freshness of the prawns or sweetness of the corns etc. \n<br />Variety-wise was similar besides a few Dim Sum which tasted normal. Wasn\'t quite convinced by the different steam-time based on the plate colours which would overcook some of the food, and had decided to adjust the duration based on own instinct instead. (Rong Fu Ji\'s standard 3-min for all, less 2-min beef and 4-min fish yielded better results)\n<br />Lastly, there wasn\'t any wow-factor from porridge cooking underneath at the end of the meal. Was expecting a rich and flavourful porridge like that I had tasted at Orange Steamboat (very shiok) in Taipei but was disappointed.\n<br />Comparatively, this meal felt more expensive both in terms of pricing and its quality of food. Would had been able to enjoy a hearty steamboat meal at J-pot with the same amount. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #steampot
Go for the seafood choices especially the clams which were the bf and my favourite during the tasting last week. Sweet, fresh and succulent - I only wished that we had more!! #burpple #steamboxsg #steampotting #seafoodlover
I first experience the new way of enjoying steamboat at Rong Fu Ji at The Grandstand. Hence the concept is not exactly new to me. The so called high speed steaming technology or more commonly known as steam pot is first brought to fame in Hong Kong by Alan Tam. Similar to steamboat experience, all the ingredients are brought to the table raw. Instead of boiling, the raw ingredients is steamed in the pot around two to six minutes subject to the ingredients. This allows the natural juices and nutrients of the ingredients to be sealed in.
