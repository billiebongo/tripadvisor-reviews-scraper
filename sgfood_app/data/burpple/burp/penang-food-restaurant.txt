Surely one of the better salted egg dishes around. Slices of fried sotong coated in a generous amount of super gao, creamy salted egg sauce, with just the right amount of crunch. So sinful but good! This small size fed 3 of us very well but if you need more, the medium goes for $21 and the large at $28.
Back again at Penang Seafood Restaurant, this time to try out a few of their other signatures! One of the most popular dishes here is the Penang Fried Kway Teow, done with a light amount of wok hei and studded with lup cheong and cockles. Not the best, but we enjoyed the heat packed in this (you can also request for no chilli) paired with sweetness from the slices of lup cheong. The medium portion here can feed about 3-4 pax but you can also get the small at $5 or large at $10!
Hokkien mee with la-la! It is light, smooth and easy to eat. It is not too overpowering in taste so you can taste the seafood.
This plate of Ribs King (ÊéíÈ™®Áéã) is like an upgraded version of sweet and sour pork, because they use the meat from pork ribs to prepare this. So the end product are slices of real tender and juicy pork ribs (deboned) coated with a good balance of sweet and sour sauce.
Penang Seafood Restaurant is no ordinary \"zi char\" restaurant you see in Singapore. They also sell some Penang specialities such as prawn noodles and Penang char kway teow.
Served de-shelled, you can comfortably enjoy these good sized prawns together with its thick pumpkin salted egg sauce. The two elements worked rather well together with a very slight kick of spice at the end. It was also quite shiok to dip the generous amount of sauce given with other dishes!
I love eggplants and Penang Seafood Restaurant did theirs rather well! Served in a claypot, the dish was kept warm throughout our meal. The garlic flavours weren\'t that strong, overall well balanced.
I haven‚Äôt had that many Hokkien Mee but seeing that this is one of the restaurant‚Äôs signature dishes and crowd favourite, of course we had to get one for ourselves! Stir fried in fried pork lard and generous fresh seafood (squid, prawns, clams) with a nice amount of wok hei, it was obviously a comforting dish hard to dislike. Definitely preferred this over the Crown Prince Spicy Mee Hoon!
This Crown Prince Spicy Mee Hoon was lightly spiced with some amount of wok hei, but was too dry and not as flavourful as it looked. I would recommend to head to JB Ah Meng for their char bee hoon but stick to the more impressive La La Hokkien Mee here!
Although named Penang Seafood Restaurant, it doesn‚Äôt just serve Penang dishes but a whole huge range of other zi char. The queues were really long despite it being a weekday, so I would definitely recommend reservations before heading down. But, there‚Äôs a minimum spending amount imposed for reservations although I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs for all group sizes. We tried to reserve a table for 6 and that needed a minimum spending of $120, which we did without in the end since we were there early. Food was great, one of the better zi chars around! Will surely be back in future to try the other popular dishes like the Penang Laksa and Salted Egg Sotong!
Thick chunky strips of deep fried fermented pork belly, we enjoyed that crunchy savoury exterior paired with its tender fatty meat. The version here is more oily and fatty than the one we had at JB Ah Meng but flavours were slightly stronger here. So sinful but also easy to wipe clean!
Made our way down to Penang Seafood Restaurant ‚Äì one of the places in Burpple\'s Best Zi Char Guide! üòâ
I love this sticky gooey goodness!!! Ordered the mediums size and it was nicely shared among 6 of us. Seriously addictive. What a punch üëäüí´üòç
The prices have gone up $3 for this one. But  you\'ll be shocked at the layerssss of crispiness!! The crave is real for this one dish. 
Just around the corner from Aljunied MRT Station is this popular zi char stall that our Burpple community loves. Rather than looking out for its signboard, heed Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim\'s advice and look for the long queue instead. Take this time to scan their massive menu for dishes you might want to try ‚Äî like the popular Penang Fried Kway Teow (from $5). If it\'s your first time here, order the crowd favourite Lala Hokkien Mee (from $8) that has equal parts wok hei and fried pork lard. It\'s slicked in a wet sauce and comes served with a generous amount of sotong, prawns and clams. Be sure to share the popular Salted Egg Sotong (from $14) that comes with perfectly cooked squid rings, coated in an unbelievably crisp batter and tossed in a umami-rich, wet salted egg sauce, as well as the tasty Fermented Pork Belly ($12)! \n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person \n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim
I\'m always a big fan of the Penang style Char Kuay Teow as opposed to the sweet sauce style you tend to find around the island. This dish is great and full of flavour, one of my favorite dishes to order when I come here.
In my opinion this Hokkien Mee is one of the best I\'ve had in Singapore. It\'s amazing that this restaurant manages to achieve a high standard for every single dish that it serves. Make sure you get a good amount of chili and lime that they serve with it!
I\'m pretty sure you\'re going to be satisfied if you order any Salted egg dish here as the sauce is fantastic. Love the taste of the curry leaves and the slight spice from the chili just gave the perfect balance to every piece. Highly recommended!
You can tell how they get the consistency of the sauce on point just by looking at the picture. Always a good dish to order to accompany the rest of the meal.
This soup is a must have! Naturally fragrant chicked herbal broth, tender chicken, dried scallops, juicy mushroom. N yes the bug portion is very much welcomed.
CNY Set lunch, 9 dishes @ sgd538. 1st dish: a meh nothing to shout out yusheng, but the staff serving yusheng is impressive!
Crisp outside, tender inside, the flaky fillet of cod is fresh, with a good savoury sweet salty flavour.
The secret is in the belacan üå∂ that comes with this! $8
With a nondescript exterior and limited signage, this place is so well concealed that with one quick glance, you might not even notice it. What you should look out for instead is the long queues especially during peak hours. One of the signatures and a must-order is the Lala Hokkien Mee ($8). With no lack of wok hei and pork lard, this is a truly comforting meal as you indulge in the fresh squid, prawns and of cause those huge clams! Totally zhup and slurp-worthy. Other noteworthy dishes include Salted Egg Chicken ($13) and Baby Spinach Soup ($10).
Fresh, meaty sweet deshelled prawns, covered in a mound of curry leave spiced cereal oats! Love the delicious crunch!
Quite close to the Penang, Malaysia version, with savoury smoky wok hei / breath of the wok. Just a tad dry though, but better than most other \"Penang Char Kway Teow\" in Singapore!
The thick Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, style gravy is the winner here. Deep and savoury with the flavour of pork lard, the gravy makes the noodles delightfully slippery!
Located beside Aljunied MRT Station, this brightly lit coffee shop opens till midnight daily, and is the place to go for tasty Penang-style noodles. The Lala Hokkien Mee (from $8 for small) is a long time favourite. Slicked in a wet sauce, the latter is peppered with bits of fried lard, and the cook is super generous with the sotong, prawns and clams. The Crown Prince Spicy Mee Hoon (from $8 for small) is also good and redolent with wok hei. Order the Fried Sotong with Salted Egg (from $13 for small) to share. The batter is crisp, the squid is cooked perfectly, and the sauce is full of umami. Most of the small portions are good for two to share, except the salted egg sotong, which is quite rich and better shared among three.\n<br />Avg price: $15 per person \n<br />Photo by Burppler Kar Yan Yeong
Our favourite has got to be the char kway teow, followed by assam laksa and salted egg yolk chicken! üòã Happy long weekend!
Not too bad something different from your usual beehoon and this dish has a fancy name!
Tried asaam laska for the first time and is a really appetising dish. Being different from the SG version. This assam laska only has cucumber slices and marckarel as the side ingredients. The dark sauce drizzled on top is \"har gao\", prawn paste to add more flavour. The soup is well flavoured being sweet, sour and i would prefer it to be more spicy. Despite being expensive at $4.80 for small size, its great to give it a try and is just beside Aljunied MRT station. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
For the price paid, they are very generous with the seafood (sotong, prawns and lala). It tastes so good once you start it\'s so hard to stop! 
I believe this is the signature dish but I was terribly disappointed when I tried it. I was already doubtful when it was served. Not enough wok hei and it\'s just not flavorful enough. The other dishes turned out to be way better than this. 
One of the signature dishes. Recommend this dish to groups of at least three people. Ordered this for two people and it was just too jelat too finish it. But still üëçüèº!
There is this \"friendly\" zi char restaurant. Flooded with tourist and locals, the owner had to rent another shop stall to ease the waiting time. .\n<br />|\n<br />Ironically they are famous for their curry fish head but the one we had was overwhelmed with MSG. Other than that, the rest of dishes were above average. Especially the addictive fried pork collar, so good and so addictive. .\n<br />|\n<br />For the full course ‚û°Ô∏è http://www.jiaknonstop.com/restaurant/penang-seafood-restaurant
Ordered mainly large dishes and the servings are generous for about 8 people! 
The lard is very crispy. The sotongs are fresh and have a nice texture. The noodles are more wet instead of the dry ones that I usually eat. Cannot compare both tastes as both taste equally nice. A generous amount for $8. Ate it for lunch/dinner as it was stomach-fulfilling. The clams and eggs are delicious too. Location is near mrt. üòÑ
Headed out and indulged in some good old char kway teow and hokkien mee!!! The ckt had that super awesome wok hei smokiness and hokkien mee had LA LA!!!!!!! Made my ‚ù§Ô∏è go lalalaaaa haha üòÇ ÎÑàÎ¨¥ ÎßõÏûàÎäî Í≤É Í∞ôÏïÑÏöî! #tinythrowbackhaha
Quite a rare find I think. Loads of wok hei in that charred bee hoon ( smoky flavor ) and plump prawns. üòã‚ú®üëç
A true test of the quality of food in a Tze Char restaurant, and the honesty of their staff. Taste-wise this fared pretty well, with the curry being thick and spicy with the use of dried shrimp in its cooking. The fish head was also tender and there were plenty of other stuff that sufficiently the four of us. The issue would have been the dishonest staff who seemed to have tried ripping us off by charging an exorbitant price on the bill trying to trick us into believing that they served a type of fish which wasn\'t in the claypot, only to deduct $8 off the bill straightaway when we told them about it upon seeing the bill. Guilty much?
When this came out, the Chinese Wine used in the cooking of the chicken was so alluring that it got the people in the queue really excited as they kept asking us about it. The wine was strong and evident, with savoury flavours of the steamed chicken, though I wasn\'t really much a fan of the chicken which was a bit too bony.
Sotong wasn\'t rubbery and the batter was able to remain crisp while the dish was left sitting around for a while. Salted Egg sauce was flavourful and creamy, but a tad inconsistent where some bits were more creamy, while some have more salted egg yolk. Still above average though.
Pretty much the same thing as the Penang Fried Kway Teow, this had a light wokhei that we thought would have really been better if it could be stronger. Otherwise this is one of the Hokkien Mee that is slightly above average, with a flavourful but not so sticky broth with well-cooked noodles.
There is a distinct but light wokhei exuding from this dish, but it seemed to have stopped short somewhere. If anything, I thought the Kway Teow was well-fried and slight sweet with the sausages releasing its flavour into the Kway Teow.
I love anything fried, and this is one dish that I truly enjoyed even for its simplicity. What was so addicting was the strong prawn paste marinade, which makes it so flavourful amidst the crisp skin and tender pork.
Was exceptionally good today. Lunch is usually more enjoyable here. Better service too and less crowd.
Just $5.50. Good for more than one person.üòã‚ú®üëçüëçüëç #pearlspectives  #pearlsphotography
The food here is even better than I remembered. Everyone on my IG feed seems to be feasting on Hokkien mee this week, so I\'ve been craving my fave la la Hokkien mee the past couple of days. Heh. And while we\'re at it, we got the lard-heavy Penang char kway teow for good measure. X=
A twist to the usual prawn hokkien mee. The addition of sweet, succulent clams intensify the flavour of the broth. Squeeze some lime juice over the noodles &amp; smear lots of sambal belacan for that extra oomph! Ahhhh~~ comfort food!
Fresh fish with firm, flaky texture yet moist in tangy tamarind gravy. Give me a bowl of rice &amp; I think I can finish the fish by myself!
The soup is light, not full-blown enough. But this dish is comforting with good balance of prawns and pork bones. Huge prawns to make anyone happy. And let\'s thrown in the egg for good measure. Thumbs-up for geylang, once more. 
Came highly recommended by the servers who insisted on us having this dish over their fame Assam fish head. And boy it\'s good, fresh big grouper head with flavorful broth steaming and bubbling. Gosh, I am drooling just thinking of it. 
Cheap good and flavorful. Seriously this simple dish win every top-notch restaurants in Singapore hands down, with it\'s thick broth that is tasty to the single last drop. 
This is the 1st crab I manage to eat. It\'s not the signature crabby dish from the restaurant but you\'ll never sorry for ever order it. Spicy, and there\'s a kick of curry after taste from the curry leaf. And the crab, even though small in size, it is pretty meaty and full of those delicious eggs. Love it too, even after eat that O started to get those swollen allergic effect. And yes, am allergic to crab :))
Sweet, sour.. It taste more like \"ayam goreng mentega\" in Indonesia but much more tastier. There a kick of spiciness on the dish and an after taste of curry from the curry leaf scattered on the dish. Love it #latepost  
one of their signature dishes (6/10): have had better versions. broth could b tastier. for people who prefer Ê∏ÖÊ∑° taste. 
another signature dish (7/10): battered squid rings in salted egg sauce and curry leaves
chock full of wok hei! pretty authentic, using the thin flat noodles &amp; pork lard üòòüòòüòò 
one of their signature dishes but I would only rate it 2/10. sambal is too sweet and a lot of empty shells. 
Managed to find the familiar taste of Penang. Was craving for laksa. Asam laksa and sambal lala was good. Char kwoy teow was soso. I am now full and feeling satisfied üòä
The sauce was deliciously creamy with the perfect balance of sweet from the pumpkin and salty from the salted egg yolk!
A delectably crunchy exterior bursting with prawny goodness encrusts moist chicken flesh within. Nomz
The restaurant\'s signature dish
If you want Malaysian Cze Char, but really don\'t want to be stuck in the causeway jam for 2 hours, then this is a good alternative (unfortunately at Singapore price tag). Awesome food. Always a crowd here.
Thought it was a pretty ordinary plate of CKT and was rather oily. But I still enjoyed every mouth of the kway teow with the crispy pieces of lard and thinly sliced Chinese sausages. Not a Penang-style kway teow like what many would have expected.
My must have: salted egg yolk sotong. New try: marmite chicken which is very tasty but the chicken has too many tiny bones which make it cumbersome to eat.
One of the best in SG.
A tad oily but very flavourful.
Amazing plate of fried sotong. Must eat.
A stone\'s throw from Aljunied MRT lies a row of shophouses and one particularly stood out from the rest for its long queues especially during peak hours. With an extensive menu that consists of many classic zi char dishes, the must-order is definitely their Lala Fujian Noodles ($8/$12) which boasts a strong wok hei, fitting to claim as one of the signatures.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />If you have not known, Burpple has launched a guide that lists 15 of the Best Zi Char Places in Singapore which you can read it here: https://www.burpple.com/list/504295/15-best-zi-char-places-in-singapore and Penang Seafood Restaurant has been featured as one of the spots.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Penang Seafood Restaurant\n<br />Address: 76, Lorong 25A Geylang, Singapore 388258\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock

But OMG! The fat and the collagen melted perfectly and smoothly in my mouth! This is such a good LCHF dish (low carb high fat)! The gravy was not too salty, not too sweet.

Fresh, bouncy squid, coated in thick, savoury curry spiced salted egg yolk gravy. So addictive!
Whole red grouper, fresh sweet fish meat, in a sweat-inducing sour spicy assam / tamarind gravy!
Good in itself - better still with friends.
Always so comforting.
Great kick to the sauce with the Chilli padi.
They were generous with their portion but taste wise, it\'s like a decent plate of Prawn Hokkien Mee. Sticking to my Laksa!  #sayhellojas #burpple #penangseafoodrestaurant #aljunied #lala #clam #singapore
Flat rice noodles fried with egg, prawn, chinese sausage, beansprout and cockles. Seasoned with light and dark soy sauce so it appears dark in color. Famed local hawker dish in Sg and Msia, the secret to this is being fried over high heat therefore a maillard reaction a charring of ingredients are sparked to produce this marvel.  #wokhei #sgeat #sgfood #food #foodie #local #hawker #foodporn #yummy #delicious #latenight #supper #taste #burpple #burpplesg #penangseafoodrestaurant
Sour and thick paste as compared to Sg\'s version that has more coconut flavor. Excellent broth of lime and prawn flavor but almost no meat inside. #sgeat #penangseafoodrestaurant #foodie #sgfood #sg #burpple #burpplesg #yummy #laksa #food #foodporn #taste #tzechar
