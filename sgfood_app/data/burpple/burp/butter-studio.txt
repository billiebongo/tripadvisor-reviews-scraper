Sea salt caramel red velvet was not bad but a bit dry. Hot Butterscotch milk was yum! 
üòåüòå As delicious as it looks. Worth trying despite it being too costly for it\'s size. Cookie Dough Tart and Sea Salt Nutella Tart ($6.90) , topped with crushed almonds and tart lined with caramel.
Ispahan (Lychee Rose Cake)
You need good products, extensive experience and passion to keep it going. Today, I met the owner of @ButterStudio, Shannon, at her 3-year-old cafe along Jalan Besar. A sincere and passionate lady, she grew up in a family of home bakers. Her grandmother is very good in baking and their house is always filled with smell of butter (hence the name). Adapting from her grandmother\'s recipes, she started baking and eventually, she gave up her corp comms job to start a kiosk in Changi Airport. Her perseverance led her to bigger things. Three years ago, she started her halal-certified bakery in Jalan Besar (opposite Jalan Besar Food Centre). To get the #halal certification, she took great pains to source for the appropriate ingredients for her cakes. Her signature items include Ispahan (Lychee Rose Cake), Salted Caramel Red Velvet Cake, Nutella Tart, Speculoos Cookie Butter Tart etc. For me, I always go for their salted gula melaka cupcake - pandan cake base with gula melaka filling in the centre and topped with gula melaka cream cheese. Butter Studio also does beautiful dessert table for weddings and events. P/S They will be doing my wedding dessert table, I am soooo excited!! üòç
Ordered their best seller, Salted Caramel Red Velvet Cake. I really liked it as it was moist and the cream cheese frosting wasn\'t too sweet. I will go back and try their cupcakes. =======================================\n<br />You can discover hand-picked F&amp;B, events and more with a sweet incentive through SUGAR app. Follow the instructions below and you will get $30 credits for FREE! \n<br />1.

The pandan cupcake is stuffed with gula melaka filling and infused with salted gula melaka cream cheese. ‚ù§Ô∏è it! P/S They are halal certified!
It\'s moist it\'s delicious its superb you guys need to head down to Butterstudio to get this cuppy!!! 
I kept checking the cross section of the tart with every subsequent bite I took because it puzzled me to no end ‚Äì no matter how hard I looked, I just couldn\'t catch a glimpse of the salted caramel hidden in the luscious, sticky Nutella. Yet, I could taste its distinctly buttery, burnt sugar flavour and detect its stickiness between my teeth. What an intriguing dessert!
Looks pretty intimidating, but the cake was surprisingly light and incredibly moist ‚Äì I thought of sharing, but ended up wolfing the entire slice down by myself üôä. The cream cheese frosting was suitably lush and velvety, not greasy, but it was far too sweet. What\'s really lovely, though, was the extra drizzle of salted caramel trickling down the cake ‚Äì it had the fullness of a butterscotch sauce. Mad love!
Top left hand corner: variety of asstd tarts Saltedcaramel Nutella tarts,salted butterscotch tarts,Belgian choc tarts for all who love sweet stuff $6.9 for the tarts. 2nd pic their best salted caramel red velvet cake sell in slice for $7.9 and in whole for 8inch $68. Over the rainbow cuppy for all kids that make them turn crazy and will bright up their days by looking at it $3.5 and not to forget their best seller SALTED CARAMEl Cupcakes!!! $3.5 too.üòãüëçüëç
Cosy place and quiet place for catch-ups with friends!! Unfortunately for us, a wailing baby was present so we didn\'t get to enjoy much peace hahahaha. Service was good and the cafe decor was so pretty!!! We had pancakes there bc well you can never go wrong with pancakes heh :B I had the chocolate one and it was hella goooood. The chocolate syrup was just the right sweetness and the fruits were perfect for the wonderful taste of the pancakes. I\'d rate the pancakes a 4/5!!! :) 
Looks pretty sweet aye? Indeeed! But definitely, tolerable for you sweetooth out there! Tried out a few good stuff from Butter Studio, including their Sea Salt Caramel Red Velvel cake and Pistachio chocolate pie. Amazing! A good cosy hangout place for sure! Here, it\'s what i tried because, i\'m such a Nutella Lover. Pancakes, with Generous amount of Nutella Spread, with banana and strawberry slices, and wait that\'s not it! It is then completed with caramel drizzle. Damn son! Sweetness level : OVERLOAD! Yums!
After having my lunch, i in need of something chocolaty to fill up my stomach. Ordered Nutella Strawberry Chocolate Pancake and Salted Caramel Velvet Cake. Worth of price and a feel of best homely cafe. There\'s a free lemonade drink üçã
This is not coffee, but vanilla milk infused with butterscotch. The drink is not too sweet and has a very good balance of dairy and butterscotch. An interesting discovery at Butter Studio. 
An array of delectable treats to choose from at Butter Studio! Their most popular dessert is the nutella tart with sea salt. Unfortunately, they were all sold out the day I went. Will definitely go back to get my paws on that soon! Overall cozy ambience with really good music too.
A homely cafe situated along Jalan Besar, offering a range of cakes, tarts, cupcakes, and savoury cafe food. We had the sea salt nutella tart, salted caramel red velvet cake, and cookies &amp; cream milkshake cake. It was pretty quiet on a weekday afternoon, making it a good place to chill. 
Nice cakes with top on ice cream and settings. Friendly staffs ready to serve u anytime 
Another halal cafe in singapura! This is honey mustard sandwich (cant remember the exact name) 
For those who have sweettooth and nutella lovers. This is the best pancake so far.! üí™üëçüëç
By buying a delicious Nutella tart! With every bite, a bit of the nastiness goes away!
My 1st cafe hunting. Did a birthday suprise for my girlfriend.. I suggest they need to have a birthday song to be played on. On the other hand, the ambience was home-like, the foods was great though limited choices. But we definity had fun. 
Blueberry tea $6.50 - smooth; not sour unlike some blueberry tea I had tried before üëç with Nutella malt cake $7.90 - very sweet, not much Nutella taste. üëé
Love the ambience and cupcakes are nice ~ Need to go back and try more flavours
Nothing spectacular. But I love the cream. Sinful and fulfilling... Oh yar, cnt understand why they place the cake that way too. Cakes are supposed to stand tall up, aren\'t they! 
I feel that this is the best place for desserts! Especially love their combinations of sweet and salted. What\'s better is that it\'s halal!
Not too bad for a first try of their baked rice  (accompanied with the peach tea in a pot), would love to come back for more!
$9.90 for quite a big slice. Tasted decent, nothing to overly hyped about. Nice and cosy place... Can be crampy if crowded.
The fondest memories are made when gathered around the table. \n<br />Loving my productive weekend running errands &amp; spending quality time with the loved ones! #mondaydontcomesosoon
The ambience in the cafe is very cozy and comfy. Enjoy the wide range of desserts available from cupcakes , tarts and cakes with your love ones.
Found a cosy corner along Jalan Besar. Chillax ambience and affordable grub :D
Lovely space but the food is too meh. Coffee lovers, you won\'t wanna spend your $5 here.
It\'s really great to a place of your own üè° , cant wait for it! -\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #burpple  #brunch #sgbrunch #cake #sgcake #sgbake #teatime #christmas #cupcake

Exquisite and dainty scented flowers delicately positioned on the velvety layer of frosting that is infused by lychee essence.\n<br />The soft and moist cake below preening an elegant pink is full of raspberry composite that will bring a refreshing fragrance and lovely saccharine with every bite.\n<br />Let its sweetness melt away your heart.
I swear i love this so muchüòãüòã

Warmed poached eggs, chicken ham, turkey bacon nestled on top of English muffins with in-house hollandaise sauce. \n<br />Oh yes cafe is halal certified too :-)
And artisan coffee are priced at $4-$6. I love that this cafe is Halal certified. A perfect place to chill out with your Muslim friends over something light. Opens daily from 9.30am-11pm. #sgfoodsteps #sgcafe #sgfood #burpple #sgfoodiary #cafehoppingsg #cupcakes
