Wah this Kim\'s Family no joke. Eat the side dishes with rice also damn full already. #korean #food
Fatty Pork Belly to eat spicy spring onions and Kimchi. If u are a fan of fatty porky.
I love the refillable side dishes.
Just look at the number of side dishes! 😍\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #eathealthy #burpple #sgdinner #korean #koreanfood #koreanbbq #sgweekend
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷 Favourite k-spot right now for homely and authentic tasting dishes! The Korean side dishes are 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻✨ and a huge crowd puller. Ordered a super value-for-money $15 set of soy bean paste stew and pork bulgogi!! The stew is my fave Korean dish done right with the briny goodness of mussels and clams 😋 And I forgot how much more $$$ for the kimchi stew and spring onion pancake 🐙 but they were chockful of ingredients too. Missing my long weekend alr!!! It\'s so blueee today 💙 #burpple #dqky

Not just for its mains, but for the plentiful banchan they give you at the start of the meal! #koreanfoodsg #koreanfood #foodinmymouth #foodphotography #ilovesharingfood #foodporn #foodforfoodies #foodspotting #fooddiary #sharefood #food #instafood #foodgasm #burpple

The best Korean food in Singapore!
Big portion and cost $12. Authentic Korean food~😋
The portion was quite big but tasted mediocre. However, I was amazed by the efficient service. All food was served within 10 minutes upon ordering. Overall, it was a fulfilling meal. \n<br />_________________________________\n<br />#sgfoodies #sgfoodie #foodporn #foodgasm #instagood #foodie #foodies #instadaily #cafesg #food #yummy #foodphotography #foodpics #igers #sgrestaurant #sgcafe #koreanfood #kimchi #beefbulgogi
