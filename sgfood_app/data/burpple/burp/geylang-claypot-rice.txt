This dish is only served during weekends. Beneath the lotus leaf was chestnuts, mushrooms, chicken feet and pork ribs. Pork was soft and tender, infused with the sauce. 
Eat the claypot rice, soft shell crab, fried French beans and tofu too!
French beans were slightly overcooked and salty. Dried shrimps were really dry and lag crunch. Next. 
Claypot rice cooked in an earthen pot, with ingredients including chicken, chinese sausages (lup cheong), waxed pork and bits of salted fish. The rice has characteristics of a good claypot rice -an aromatic, smoky flavour and crispy rice crusts at the bottom of the pot. Best to call before heading down as the waiting time for the claypot rice is 25 mins. We called &amp; was served within 10-15mins. 
Ëç∑ËëâÊéíÈ™®. Pork ribs, chestnuts, chicken feet &amp; mushrooms wrapped in lotus leaves. Pork ribs were tender and slide off bones easily. Gravy was good &amp; I drizzled on my rice! Dish was well executed. Good recommendation by the staff. Note: This dish is available on weekends only. 
Only for friends who are worth it. üòõ My run hardly made up for this delicious Claypot rice.
Charcoal Claypot Rice! Call to pre-order or be prepared to wait an hour...
Came with high expectations, but the claypot rice sadly didn\'t live up to the hype. Rice wasn\'t very fluffy (think they didn\'t put enough water) and the rice came off the sides of the claypot too easily, which probably meant they didn\'t cook it for long enough. Tasted average overall, and the total bill was about $60 with a couple of zichar dishes. Unlikely to be back as there are many other better claypot rice dishes e.g. the famous one at smith street.
23 years old already @knghy! Rating: 3.5/5 the rice not really burnt but the serving speed was very fast! #burpplesg #burpple #food #foodporn #claypotrice #zichar #chinese #familyouting #sundate #qiangxxuan #fondmemories #igsg #igdaily #sgig #sgfood
Fish was good but extremely overpriced, beanies was crispy perfect! : Claypot Rice ($18), Steam Fish Head ($48), Long Beans ($11) #rachfoodadventure #igsg #sgfood #burpple
Surprisingly good, with the meat well flavored with the sauce, and the batter for the ribs, are not overly thick, that you can\'t bite into the meat. Colour looked great and the portion is good for sharing! 
Tasty !!!
