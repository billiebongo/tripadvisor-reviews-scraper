Especially the broccoli cake which can get you addicted to it! 😋
I love the cheesy crust and salmon flakes but I still prefer the beef version.  On another note, check out my new toy that is making its debut here. 🍳 (Date: 22 December 2015 Tuesday) #lasagna #salmon #ikearestaurant #putitto
15 pieces of these yummy meatballs served with a scoop of mashed potato, jam and slathered in gravy for only $8.50 from @ikeasingapore 😍😍 #burpple #ikeameatballs #ikeasg
What is your must-order item when you are at the IKEA Restaurant? After the horse-meat fiasco with their meatballs, IKEA drew much flak from the scandal but sales have not plummeted, instead created more demand during the investigation period. Ever since then, IKEA Meatballs ($8.50 for 15 pcs) have continued to be one of the most popular items in the menu. With a mixture of beef and pork, the meatballs paired impeccably with the brown sauce and lingonberry jam.
What more do I have to say, the classic meatballs,wings and salmon☺️☺️☺️
What can you buy for 50 cents... This awesome ice cream! Soft and creamy and smooth delightful ice cream :) #ソフトクリーム
Here is our lunch for today at IKEA. #cuisineparadiseeatout #ikeafood #burpple
Chicken wings, meatballs with potato, fried rice with chicken wing and meatball pasta.
Non-hawker but I\'ve got nowhere else to classify this routine indulgence.
First time trying their dessert! And this is good! Balanced chocolate taste with the caramel butterscotch taste, crumbleable tart base - $3.50. In the background, refreshing elderflower drink at $1.
Oh my goose! The turkey at IKEA is humongous! Lots of tender meat at $9.90 #burpple
More like a tart to me cuz it has a dry and coarse texture, though that doesn\'t negate its deliciousness. 
I had 3 others with me to conquer all these, though I ate most of them. My personal favorite was the rosti with broccoli inside, a side in the salmon in lemon and dill sauce dish. Of course the classic meatballs and chicken wings were a hit too, and the silky mashed potato was lightly spiced making it different from those you get outside. The nasi Briyani had nothing remarkable, but what was most disappointing was the pork knuckle which was the costliest. It had a weird aftertaste that I compared to the smell of the pig\'s stable. No special sauce was provided either. 
$5.50 for 10 meatballs. Served with mashed potatoes, gravy and a idk what jam. Everything compliments each other and I must say I love Swedish meatballs!
Sweedish Meatballs with mashed potato and jam, deep fried half spring chicken with fries and some grilled/raw salmon thingy. Haha. The name is pretty had to rmb but it was goodie. Awesome meal for 2!
Damn it, no more pork!! Standard drop a lot too, it\'s rather tasteless, sauce is diluted as well. They have been good for so many years!! What happen?! So disappointed!
The standard orders when you pay a visit to ikea. But, the standard has dropped, hasn\'t it?
Including the free coffee it is real value for money S$3.90
Finally trying out the cafe opposite my house! Meet my decadent delicious buddy Chocolate Indulgence Jr☺🍰🍫#vscocam #sgfood
Supper long Q, all throng to take the one day special meat ball promotion@Ikea. 
Interesting find - Salmon spread! Must try it with bread on ham and egg heh
some combo just don\'t work and for that matter, this didn\'t too.. I felt the salmon aroma was stealing away the cheese aroma! Cream sauce instead of tomato sauce was used too.. hmm... perhaps that is the culprit? But I have to applaud IKEA for using fish as an alternative to red meat or perhaps even chicken..\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#lasagna#salmon#ikea#cafesg#ikeasg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#salmonlasagna#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#tampines#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#lasagne#STFoodtrending

Located at 60 Tampines North Drive 2, Singapore 528764. Salmon Fillet 🐟  What a pretty plate of Salmon Fillet serve with vegetable medallion, mixed vegetable, Broccoli accompanied with lemon dill sauce. We love the Pan-Seared Salmon Fillet with lemon dill sauce, it taste so delicious! Vegetable Medallion also taste surprisingly awesome and tasty, can be well accepted even for non-veg lovers! @ikeasingapore #hungryunicornsg #ikeafood #ikeasingapore #ikeafoods #ikeasg

Delicious Swedish Meatballs! What a meal! *Tummy rubs!* @phusionade #ikea #ikeafood #ikeaswedishmeatballs #swedishmeatballs #salmonfillet
Wish they come with steam or boil potatoes so that can can market it as \'health\' food. Nonetheless, it wasn\'t my dish but I still get to savor some of it and apart of the meat being slightly dry, it\'s still decent especially when you dip into the ketchup or chilli!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#chicken#springchicken#ikea#cafesg#ikeasg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#rosemary#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#tampines#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
The salmon is typically \'IKEA\'s standard and the vegetable madellion which is something like the \'Ang Mo\' version of a begedil was quite good I must say...\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#salmon#fish#ikea#cafesg#ikeasg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#hollandaisesauce#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#tampines#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Try out their new Fish N Chips ($6) instead of Chicken Chop ($3) and we love the crispy crumbed fish which is good without that fishy scent (going to check out their frozen food stall downstairs for this later 😁). Oh ya the $1 chocolate mousse cup also not bad, very rich and creamy texture. And there is also changes on their beverage dispenses with sparkling flavour drink such as cherry, lemon, green tea and etc at $1.50 per glass. #cuisineparadiseeatout #ikeafood #burpple #pasta #fishnchips
