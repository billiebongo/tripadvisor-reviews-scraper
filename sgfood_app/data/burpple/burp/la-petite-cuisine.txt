Back to have one of my favourite beef burgers! This one is so simple - it\'s just a beef patty and rocket leaves, but so yummy thanks to the superb Sarawak pepper mayo and dried tomato relish. 
Give this a miss - it hardly smelt of truffle oil, and tasted like ordinary fries :(
One of our favourite combinations for burgers, the blue cheese &amp; William pear beef burger from Relish.
Their blue cheese beef burgers is definitely worth the try!! &amp; you are able to choose your side for a healthier choice such as salad, or with the fries. Just additional $3 you are able to change your fries into truffle fries or other sides offers on the menu :) quiet at night, with a cosy ambience
This dish was a pleasant surprise! I wasn\'t in the mood for the burgers that Relish is usually popular for. This Fettucine is a great choice if you want something filling yet not too heavy. It was slightly pricey, at $20, but that\'s the average price at Relish for mains. Definitely worth a try!
The meat was so wonderfully tender and flavourful after being stewed in a sweet salty sauce. People who like the chewy crunchy texture of soft bone should also be happy because there was plenty to be found in these plump chunks of pork. The focaccia was toasted and slathered with a creamy coleslaw, which made this burger taste a lot like pulled pork with an oriental twist. I loved the dressing for the side salad (you can opt for fries), which had ginger and sesame oil, very similar to the flavours in chicken rice. Loved this burger!
This was an amazing combo! Spam fries were crisp, not greasy and didn\'t have the awful aftertaste that some spam have. Lime mayo was creamy yet so refreshing, and was perfect with the salty spam. I\'ve never liked spam but I thoroughly enjoyed this. 
Quite an interesting rendition of crushed cheesecake with the strawberry sauce at the bottom. Still prefer the traditional though.  
A simple aglio olio that seemed a little too dry
Relish is sort of an oldie-but-goodie, with great value for money. Chef Willin Low really knows how to create unique local twists on the classics. The Wild Rocket Beef Burger ($18.50) features a Sarawak pepper cream and a sun-dried tomato relish that combines to work wonders. Give the Ram-Lee Beef Burger ($21.90) a try if you love the flavours of the iconic Malaysian burger. If having Asian flavours in your burger doesn\'t appeal to you, go for the Blue Cheese Beef Burger with Rucola, Poached Pear &amp; Walnut Butter ($21.90), it\'s a superb combination.
Nice and interesting but I found the prata a little too oily.. 
Finally got to try at this bistro! Couldn\'t find a time to come here. The burger wasn\'t as big as I expected, but the beef patty was really juicy and the bread was crispy at a right level. The sauce was a awesome too and really suitable for Singaporeans\' tastebuds craving for some spiciness. Not exactly cheap but I feel it\'s worth the money. 
Are you a Panna Cotta Warrior?                       Light and silky, the texture of the panna cotta was already enough to leave me wanting more. But despite how I described it\'s texture, the panna cotta still held together very well on the plate throughout the process of it\'s consumption. Infused with pandan, the dish brought to mind influences from the nonya culture. What added the finishing touch to the dish was the gula melaka that was at the base of the panna cotta. It wasn\'t the cheap tasting but delicious gula melaka you would find elsewhere but it tasted rather rich and exquisite, which blended really well with the light texture and taste of the panna cotta. My duty as a panna cotta warrior dictates that I will be back for more.
Was wowed by the creativity of this dish but didn\'t feel too amazed by the taste. The taste of the basil pesto was strong, hence for people who do not like basil, this dish is not for you. Felt that the dish would have been better if it had more salt in it at the very least, rather than the taste of a very lightly salted basil pesto making up the bulk of what you could taste. But kudos over to the guys at relish for lending an interesting twist to the nostalgic bee tai bak.
With the Botanic Gardens station just beside Cluny Court, Relish has never been so convenient to get to. The food is of good quality, fun to eat, and has unique flavour combinations. Go for the Chicken Nasi Lemak with Anchovy Sambal Burger ($18.90), Blue Cheese &amp; William Pear Beef Burger ($21.90) or the Hae Bee Hiam Spaghettini ($19.90). You\'d be glad to know they serve all day brunch on weekends!
This is not your typical cheesy beef burger. It\'s packed with interesting flavours from the tangy savoury pomodoro, creamy pepper-infused mustard, and bitterness of the most hipster vegetable, rocket. The beef patty is lovely - charred along the edges but juicy and moist inside... And I didn\'t detect any fillers! üëç The side of fries is also gd - crispy and had a strong potato flavour. The char siew burger, melty and so flavourful, is also worth trying!
Scrambled eggs, German Sausage, Smoked Salmon, Baked Beans, Muffin &amp; Mushrooms. Delicious platter..
And it was DELISH! My favorite part of it was their strawberries and the crumbs!!! YUM!

gruel. In this case, it was accompanied with some grilled mushrooms, spinach pancetta, and of course that gorgeous egg in the middle. I felt that the first few bites were good, but eventually the texture got a bit overwhelming. ü§¢

No it doesn\'t come with the usual fries.
I had the soft shell crab burger (which was $20+ if I am not wrong), and I think this place can be pretty pricey. Nonetheless, the crab was cooked well although I think the burger could be crispier/ more fragrant. It\'s a nice place if you want to chill and talk to friends tho. Just be prepared to burn a hole in your pocket!! 
A bit disappointed by the cheesy truffle fries as cheese is minimal and truffle smell is not strong enough.. But the ambience at Relish is still great for chilling out! \n<br />#jinhojiak #cafe #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #instafood #instafood_sg #singaporefood #singapore #igsg #foodgasm #foodsg #burpple #nofilter #latergram #throwback #20151225
