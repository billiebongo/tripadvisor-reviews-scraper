This is one of the best cakes I\'ve eaten. It\'s also being distributed to Tampopo and other eateries. 
The matcha taste was strong the way I like it. It\'s so light, you won\'t feel guilty after consuming one all by yourself üòÜ
Unfortunately, this only looks good. #goodtoseenogoodtoeat
This √©clair is one of several chocolate-based sweets available as part of Dulcet &amp; Studio\'s Chocolate Fair which lasts from now til end November 2015.
Took away a few cream puffs after the tasting and really loved them; the Choux was crusty yet spongey enough, while the Matcha cream was rich with its signature tea aroma. Only wished if they used something else apart from whipped cream for it seemed to have diluted the flavour.
Had seen a couple of reviews about this around and I had to takeaway one just to try! Nothing beats this; the sugary sweetness of icing sugar and a crusted top, yet spongey bottom that encases a vanilla bean speckled vanilla cream which was thick, rich and smooth. So addictive I think it would be hard not to get the mini variant if I ever pass by them again!
I always have the never-failing Scoop Cake when I\'m here, but after tasting this heavenly puff, I\'m kicking myself for not having tried this earlier. 
Chiffon cakes are Dulcet &amp; Studio\'s speciality, and they have refined the recipe for this classic in lieu of the Chocolate Fair starting 1st October. Loved the cottony fluffy texture of the cake, carrying light yet prominent chocolate flavours. The chocolate cream is rich, yet subtle in flavours without being cloyingly sweet.
Jumping onto the bandwagon for all things gluten-free, this Eclair features an organic chocolate from Madagascar for the glazing to the chocolate cream from within. Perhaps something to go for if you are wanting an eclair that is nearest to a basic chocolate eclair, but with a little bit more than just that.
Taglioni tossed in a spicy tomato sauce served with Kani Kama (crab stick meat), Shimeiji and Zuchinni. A good idea for a fuss-free pasta that is of decent quality without much to pick on.
A Hawaiian-inspired dish featuring a fried egg atop multigrain rice with a handmade minced pork patty in Demi-glaze sauce. Sauce was savoury with a dash of vinegar, with caramalised onions which is sweet and nearly melted, while the pork party was juicy and springy without carrying too much meaty flavour. Fried egg was also jiggly, and the egg yolk oozes yolk when it is poked on. A dish that is simple yet comforting.
Going all chocolate, this eclair not only has a chocolate glaze speckled with coffee nibs and candied oranges over the top, but also features a dark chocolate Choux pastry as well. Choux pastry contains a cocoa-like flavour, yet having a spongey texture while carrying a short whiff of tangy dried orange flavours in between the bites. Coffee nibs seemed to have enhanced the flavours of the chocolate glaze, helping to bring out bittersweet flavour for the eclair.
Using a decent cut for the meat, it is pretty notable that the steak here is more on the lean side, yet tender and retains the meat\'s moisture. Coming with Chocolate Sauce in line with their Chocolate Fair coming up on 1st October, it is interesting how the infusion  of chocolate and red wine for the sauce works so marvelously; the chocolate used more as a spice instead, injecting cocoa flavour and gets cut off by the luxuriously subtle and sweet red wine flavours just at the right time.
Sous Vide for 12 hours before being seared at intense heat, the pork was able to pull off a crispiness on the skin but it would have been really better if they use a thicker cut of the pork for it had difficulties showcases the tender meat within signature of the above-mentioned cooking method. I particularly liked the potato served at the side; reminds me of my favourite baked potato sprinkled with bacon bits, spring onions and covered in thick sour cream but all chopped up for easier eating. 
Relaxing at this awesome japanese cafe after lunch. Like Watanabe coffee, this place offers freshly brewed syphon coffee that is so aromatic and smooth! But unlike Watanabe coffee/Wa cafe, you can choose the kind of coffee beans you want for your syphon coffee. I chose the Brazil beans for $5 a cup. Sipping great coffee and people watching on a holiday.
Too lengthy to reproduce my entire website post on the √©clairs here but my favourite was the coffee one, which may look like a tired worm with major spinal issues but was the most sophisticated in taste profile, possessing a worldly, musky fragrance and a wise bitterness, with playful sugary nuts to remind you that he‚Äôs still young at heart. 3.9/5 
If you get four eclairs, the pricing is almost buy-3-get-1-free, so naturally we went for it. 
Very tender and tasty stew and eaten with the top quality Japanese rice is superb! Yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 31
The cake was incredibly light, as with the cream. Very Japanese style. But the matcha flavour was sorely lacking - which was supposedly what this cake is all about ! $7
I\'ve finally found a justifiably priced brunch item, and this, is your favorite breakfast items - scrambled eggs, bacon, greens, atop of their oh so FLUFFY chiffon cake.
Expensive but really worth it! All flavours were good especially the choclatey ones! The corn one looked interesting but I was afraid to try it HAHAHA. My parents said it tasted oddly nice so idk you could give it a try! :D
My obsession with green. Love the matcha roll at Dulcet &amp; Studio! Noms.
Ok make that two eclairs that I like. Corn On The Cob ($5.20) and Summer Breeze ($5) from Dulcet &amp; Studio. I didn\'t expect to find flavours like these but the sweet corn and apple mint eclairs are light, refreshing and unique!
Soft and fluffy cake coupled with the cream that is rich but yet not ËÖª that makes me keep wanting for more. So yummy! \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Dulcet &amp; Studio is famous for its cream puff and this is no exception. Cream on the top but strawberry jam below. Really yummy tea break. 
I got three flavours (from top down) Coffee, Chocolate and Nutty Caramel. They cost $5 each. In my opinion, they are ok. I still haven\'t found an eclair that \"wows\" me in Singapore. Any recommendations? I\'ve tried Janice Wong too.
Looking forward to our getaway this week w the BC girlies ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This place is well known for its cakes and pastries especially the puffs. So when I heard they have a nice puff I come back and it didn\'t disappoint. Creamy matcha with crispy puff exterior. Wonderful tea break. 
New matcha eclair from Dulcet &amp; Studio! \n<br />The eclair filled with a layer of redbean and kinako mochi, topped with light matcha cream and candied redbean! Yum! \n<br />#dessert #eclair #sgcafefood #openricesg #burpple #eatoutsg
The choux puff was crumbly and sweet, and you have the choice of either enjoying the green tea flavour by having both creams together for a milky finish, or going for the unadulterated powdery bitterness of the dark green matcha cream on its own if you‚Äôre feeling all mature, zen and spiritually centred that day. 3.9/5
One of my favourite cafe because they make really good cakes and pastries! They also won the best chiffon cake award recently but I have yet to try it. The puffs were so so good, delicate pastry and the matcha cream was light with a hint of matcha bitterness. Yum!! The matcha cake was well made with just the right ratio of sponge to cream, each bite was such a delight.
Crisp choux pastry as expected from Dulcet studio topped with delectable semi sweet chocolate glaze. Simple yet fabulous!
Good morning! It\'s back to reality today that\'s why can post pics early in the morning. Breakfast from ‚ù§Ô∏è
Airy, soft sponge layers filled with a light and fragrant fresh cream and paired with fresh fruit. Always nice to have because it\'s not at all cloying :)
Loved the cream patisserie - very smooth and fragrant, and only subtly sweet. I found the puff to be a taaaad soggy. It is  the chewy sort, and I loved the top of the puff which was sweet and cake-like, kind of like the top of bo lo buns. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Crispy pork in a special tonkatsu sauce! The meat is so tender and soft. 
Enjoying a teatime treat from @hsianming (thanks, boss!). Luscious, milky custard filling out a soft, golden-brown puff with a mottled, sugar-dusted crown. Yum!! 
üòå Tried their matcha chiffon, which claims to be the softest chiffon cake in Singapore. Hmm.. I guess I\'m not so convinced. üòÖ
I\'ve always eaten the cakes and pastry here and this is the first time I\'ve eaten lunch and it\'s very good. Tender and tasty beef stew goes well with rice or pasta. 
Very nice afternoon tea break having cakes and tarts here! Strawberry Cake, Blueberry Tart &amp; Matcha Chiffon Cake! Love the chiffons! Soft and slight moist! The matcha taste is good too! \n<br />#burpple #dulcetnstudiosg #liangcourt #japanesestylecafe #chiffoncakes #tarts #cafesg
Signature cake from the cute cafe at liang court, a little disappointing. Looks better than it taste.. $7/piece
Pretty chiffon cakes in many flavour start at $7.90. Had tried Grape chiffon n taste very dry. Cheese chiffon texture is more softer.
One of the best cappuccino soup I had in Singapore. The mushroom and cream blend is well balanced.
The pork is well cooked and it melts in your mouth. The curry is slightly spicy which is a good balance.
An unlikely combination that works.
Ham steak with poached egg on top plus pasta, soup of the day was onion soup, ice-lemon tea and caramel pudding. Total was $15 nett. Although the main dish look plain especially on such a big plate but the steak was well seasoned and the portion is just nice.
The cream puff is best I\'ve eaten so far. Very crispy puff skin with yummy cream inside. Taste rating: 9/10. Value for $: 9/10 ($2.43). The green tea swissroll is full of yummy green tea cream. Taste rating: 9/10. Value for $: 8/10 ($4.21)
Looks better than it taste. At least it\'s quite soft.
I am not exactly a cake fan. I don\'t even eat the cakes I bake. I also do not take cream. But this strawberry shortcake is so light , so soft, so fluffy and most importantly not that sweet. Still, I didn\'t the cream but the cake to me was perfect. üç∞
Super soft and fluffy. It\'s so airy, I love it. Call me bias, I have a thing for fluffy cakes and this is it at its best. Not too sweet, sugar level just right for you to finish everything and still don\'t feel sick of it. You know how much it sucks when you love it at the first bite,  but towards the end it just makes you all turn off? This is nothing like that my friends.
A pleasant dish for all
Light cream that doesnt taste sinful at all but satisfying at the same time. Great after meal dessert:)
Trust the Japanese to perfect the \"\"it\'s so fluffy I\'m gonna die!\"\" texture of cakes. Some say that Dulcet &amp; Studio has the best scoop cake ever, with two light-as-air sponge layers slathered with just the right amount of ethereal vanilla-scented cream and topped with fresh fruit. It sells out really quickly, and is best eaten fast at the shop. Fans of green tea can also dig into their popular Matcha Chiffon Cake (prices from $6) as well as the Matcha Cream Choux ‚Äî crisp and crumbly on the outside, and decadently creamy on the inside.
Call me a mountain tortoise but this is the first time I\'m eating a Swiss roll with caramel cream and loving it. The caramel cream is smoky yet not too sweet. Must try. 
Someone told me that this is the best ever. Well I agreed. The outside is both fluffy and crunchy and the cream is very smooth and creamy. Very good tea break. 
Uova strapazzate al peperoncino con contorno di verdure (zucchine, melanzane e cipolle) saltate in padella e insalatina di pomodori
The crepe and cream combination was heavenly.
nice place with a huge galore of desserts and delicious main course! no tax too ^_^ happy vesak day!
Because I love cream, he bought me a cream puff! S$2.60
Close up! Bursting with cream, and it blends in so well with the raspberry jam on top! I ate so much this weekend, I think I\'ve put on 5kg.
And because I need to have desserts before Monday arrives, and before the very very busy next 3 weeks, K brought me here! Favourite puff in one of my favourite cafe! \n<br />Pont Neuf S$4.20
