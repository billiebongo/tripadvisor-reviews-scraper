An impromptu shot. No get ready, steady and go. Au naturale! 🔸🔸\n<br />Super ❤ the crispy prawn crackers. The chilli dip was tintillating spicy with a bit of a citrussy twang. Dip dip dip and more dipping. Just cant stop dipping cos the chilli is so addictive. 🔸🔸\n<br />Thank you @ivan_teh_runningman for bringing us there.

Our trip to prawn noodle failed, ended up w pretty comforting clams/abalone noodle opposite river south prawn mee. Not exactly cheap but pretty ok for the generous amount of ingredients. I don\'t mind going back for another bowl. 😁😋\n<br />Try the Ngoh Hiang in the same Coffeeshop too!\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #eatoutsg #nomsterofficial #singaporeinsiders #mengkeemushroommincedmeatnoodle #mincedmeatnoodles #potd #photooftheday #picoftheday #foodie #instadaily #latergram #love #throwbackphoto

Long queue on a Sat night. 
All items are consistently fresh! I ❤ their prawn cake which has an egg in it and I ❤ egg-anything 😚 .
super tasty and yummy! :)
So we ended up trying the awesome ngoh hiong at the coffee shop opposite! 😆👍 #sgfood #kopitiam #simplepleasures #dinner
