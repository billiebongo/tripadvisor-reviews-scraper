Back for more gelato today. Today\'s flavour of the day is Pistachio.
Waffle ice cream!! The durian n baileys flavours were sooo good 😍 definitely going back for more soon! They\'ve a flavour called Snow White too! Unique! \n<br />#icecream #gelato #artisan #waffles #cottagepie #dessert
Even the godfather loves it! Flavours to try include Matcha Green Tea, Pistachio and Yuzu. Cost: S$4.50 for a scoop
The buddy recommended this, as he had it once in marina square. This outlet however, tucked in a small corner of tai seng(closer to circuit road side) serves a high quality ice cream at $5.50(with cone) in the neighborhood. This occasional treat couldn\'t be of a better timing!
Between the flavors I chose - bacio (chocolate &amp;hazelnut) and dark chocolate - I love the dark chocolate better ❤ The former is equally good as well with actual bits of crushed hazelnut 😋 It\'s just that I have soft spot for chocolate dessert and the flavor here is so intense 😍😍😍 Regretted not getting waffle to accompany this because someone ordered after me and the delicious smell just filled the whole cafe 😭 At least they don\'t melt quickly, so even without the waffles I wasn\'t left with a puddle of melted gelato that needs mopping up 😝
Life should be sweet like this.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @alferogelato, @fatwithin and @justinfoodprints for the invite.\n<br />-\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Alfero Artisan Gelato\n<br />81 Macpherson Ln\n<br />#01-37\n<br />(S) 360081\n<br />==========\n<br />-\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #exploresingapore  #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats #gelato #icecream #brownie #chocolate #dessert #dessertporn #dessertstagram

No longer craving gelato as bad, but still a good place to return to for their pistachio flavor
We tried a couple of flavours such as Pistachio, Bacio, Avocado, Hazelnut, Durian, Banana Passion Fruit, Mango &amp; Coconut sorbet.\n<br />-\n<br />Few of my favourites are:\n<br />• Durian: gao (aka thick) and smooth. If you\'re a durian lover, you\'ll most likely like this.\n<br />• Avocado: creamy with buttery and nutty hint.\n<br />• Banana Passion Fruit: quite an interesting and refreshing combination.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @alferogelato, @fatwithin and @justinfoodprints for the invite.

With around 12 types of Gelatos available, it\'s difficult to make a choice as each has their own distinctive flavour. We sampled all flavours and I almost wanted all. A few of my personal favourites are Pistachio, Avocado, Yuzu and Durian. Some interesting flavours to highlight are Snow White (Milk&amp; Honey) and Bacio (Chocolate &amp; Hazelnuts).\n<br />.\n<br />Waffles and Aunty Lily\'s Brownie (Chocolate &amp; Hazel Nut) are available to pair it to the Gelatos.\n<br />.\n<br />Waffles Plain ($4.00)\n<br />With 1 scoop ($7.50)\n<br />With 2 scoops ($9.50)\n<br />With 3 scoops (11.50)\n<br />.\n<br />Aunty Lily Brownie ($3.50)\n<br />With 1 scoop ($6.00)\n<br />.\n<br />Location: Alfero Artisan Gelato @alferogelato 81 MacPherson Lane, #01-37, Singapore 360081\n<br />.\n<br />#alferoartisangelato #alferoartisan #gelato #sggelato #burpple #burpplesg
There are over 12 on display daily and we had a hard time picking our favourite flavours. Every flavour has its own distinction and craving! These quality ice cream ingredients are imported from Italy and some sourced from different parts of the world. Only premium ingredients are used in making these yummy ice creams. Notice that these ice creams are kept in many metal containers? This allows less exposed to air, keeping denser and creamier gelato consistency.\n<br />.\n<br />Good news to dairy-free ice cream foodies. Enjoy fruity sorbet flavours like soursop, mango, strawberry and even choco superstar! To be frank, the choco superstar sorbet simply tasted like regular ice cream, less the dairy. .\n<br />And my favourite sorbet flavours are strawberries and mango; ice cream flavours eg snow white (milk and honey), pistacho, avocado and bacio (hazelnut and chocolate).\n<br />.\n<br />Enjoy these yummy ice cream with freshly prepared waffles or Auntie Lily\'s brownie. And bring a smile with warm dessert greeting specially prepared by Auntie Lily.\n<br />.\n<br />Waffles with 1 scoop at S$7.50.\n<br />Auntie Lily\'s brownie (chocolate and hazelnut) with 1 scoop at S$6.\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine?\n<br />Alfero Gelato\n<br />81 MacPherson Lane, #01-37, Singapore 360081\n<br />Closed on Mondays\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#AlferoGelato #MacPherson #IceCream #Gelato #Sorbet #Waffles #Brownie

The granny there are very nice &amp; the drew the message on themselves. So cute 😆 the green gelato on the right is pistachio, my favourite &amp; I only eat this every time i go, although I usually go to the one at orchard gateway. I can\'t remember the other flavour because I didn\'t eat it, should be lychee. Please bring back bandung flavour~~ my boyfriend really likes it
Surprised at the choice of flavours here. They do not have the typical vanilla, strawberry etc. we choose black sesame, salted caramel and ricotta cheese, which were all pretty good! As for the waffles, they are a bit on the eggy side, more like a cake? Haha
.\n<br />The answer is... ... ... .\n<br />.\n<br />*Drum Rolls*\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Just go for {ALFERO GELATO}! They are 96% FAT FREE with free-range milk 😍 not only so..

As plain as it looked, it seemed to taste as though most of the ingredients were missing. Perhaps calling it Gula Melaka would be slightly better for it was the dominant flavour in the gelato, with a rich dairy-like creaminess within though with a few ice bits around.
really buay pai la
