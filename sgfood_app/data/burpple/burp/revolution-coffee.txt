I usually fancy my mains more than my desserts at most places, but the desserts at Revolution Coffee are phenomenal. We first had the pulot hitam pudding, which is the black glutinous rice that are we familiar with that is served with coconut milk. Here, the pulot hitam are made into a pudding that is likened to a sticky date pudding. It‚Äôs rather unbelievable how the pulot hitam can be transformed into such a moist pudding. It‚Äôs drenched with some good old rich gula melaka butterscotch sauce and served with a creamy coconut ice cream as a perfect companion.
It only takes a mouthful of Shendol Delights ($10) to fall in love with it ‚Äî smooth coconut pannacotta, rich gula melaka, lod chong and house made red bean ice cream. Completely sold üôåüèª
2nd stop for the day. Signature Nasi Lemak with pork belly marinated in a secret marinade, wearing a crispy coat. I could eat a whole plate of the rice that is cooked using 10 ingredients and steamed twice. Served with ikan bilis, cucumber and 2 types of chilli‚Äîsambal belachan and coffee sambal. // Burpple eatup // #RevolutionCoffeeSG #Burpple
The house made buah keluak sauce generously coating the tagliatelle is a peranakan western fusion that worked harmoniously together. The earthiness of the black nut definitely spiced up the flavors this plate with the addition of some chilli padi for a fiery kick. The twice cooked pork belly is poached in buah keluak and is also served with some minced prawns and minced pork.
My first mouthful of this pasta and I was greeted with a whiff of strong vinegar and chilli smell which instantly reminded me of bak chor mee! Using al dente tagliatelle, it does draw resemblance to mee pok. It is served with Chef Shen‚Äôs signature 5 spice pork confit which was bursting with flavors while being tender. And how can we forget some crispy lard and fried shallots to complete this local delight turned pasta at Revolution Coffee?
Mind. Freaking. Blown. üò± Throw out all your sticky date puddings, this crazy creation from Chef Shen takes the cake and brings it to a whole other level! üòõ
The rice is made with 10 ingredients and lovingly twiced steamed in coconut milk to let it absorb all the fragrance. Definitely fluffy with each grain nicely separated, don‚Äôt expect a very strong pandan taste but a well balanced fragrant rice from the usage of 10 ingredients. The nasi lemak is served with omelette, ikan bilis, house made sambal belachan and coffee sambal. For the beef rendang, the beef is braised in coconut milk, spices and herbs till fork tender. The beef shin is used hence the presence of beef tendons which you may or may not like!
Chef Shen pulot all the stops with this incredible mod-sin dessert! \n<br />-\n<br />This is essentially a marriage of the sticky date pudding and Pulot Hitam (Black Glutinous Rice).  What I really loved was that you could taste the texture of the Pulot Hitam interspersed throughout the pudding. The distinctive but not overbearing sweetness of the Gula Melaka paired perfectly with the slight saltiness in the butterscotch. Take each bite of the pudding with the thick house made coconut ice cream and I believe even the greatest detractors of mod-sin cuisine will have second thoughts. \n<br />-\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the invite and @revolutioncoffee @chefshentan for feeding us!
Be still my black heart, this black rice beast utterly annihilates any sticky date pudding I\'ve had, and this is coming from a huge fan of sticky date puddings. Soft and slightly spongy as it should be, with a subtle hint of nuttiness reminiscent of the traditional dessert it\'s based on, the pudding is drenched in a glossy, sticky gula melaka butterscotch sauce and served with house-made coconut ice cream that\'s a clever nod to the original dessert.
Torn between 2 outstanding desserts, the very punny Mod-Sin spin on Chef Shen Tan\'s chendol took top spot in my books largely due to its superbly silken, lush coconut panna cotta drizzled with rich, buttery gula melaka syrup, that would give any Italian restaurant\'s version a serious run for its money. The accompanying house made red bean ice cream was also pleasantly smooth and creamy, without any of the powderiness I\'ve come to associate with red bean potong from my childhood years.
The sorely missed Wok &amp; Barrel\'s much beloved \"Bak Chor Mee Pasta\" returns with an updated recipe, boasting tender chunks of five-spice pork confit in a tangle of tagliatelle coated in spicy sauce. Finding little pieces of lard scattered throughout just made it even better.
Fans of buah keluak will enjoy the rich earthiness that permeates the taglietelle, and adding further weight to the dish are generous chunks of tender twice-cooked pork belly, minced pork and prawns. Don\'t be caught unawares(as I was) by the tiny yet fiery chilli padi that are peppered throughout the noodles! üòÖ
The Beef Rendang Nasi Lemak was my favourite, but I think the juicy deep fried marinated pork belly paired much better with the fiery sambal belacan and concentrated coffee sambal made from Balinese coffee grounds. Or maybe that\'s just a Peranakan\'s love for sambal belacan speaking.
Coffee sambal? Melt-in-your-mouth rendang? Twice steamed rice? All part of the revolu-shen that\'s putting great food on Revolution Coffee\'s tables at unheard of prices. (A chicken version will set you back a spiffy $4.90 ü§ë)
Purists might protest but I\'ll happily tuck into beef rendang with nasi lemak if it\'s this good, thank you very much.
Nasi Lemak Beef Rendang\n<br />-\n<br />Nasi Lemak (Coconut Rice) is easily a Singaporean favourite and many renditions of the dish can be found all across the island.\n<br />-\n<br />Chef Shen‚Äôs version comes with rice that has been twice steamed with coconut milk, not water, and over 10 different ingredients are used in the process as well. Each fluffy grain of jasmine rice gives you a well balanced mixture of coconut, pandan, onions, lemongrass and ginger flavours in your mouth. Apparently, fenugreek is also added but my tastebuds were not discerning enough. \n<br />-\n<br />However, if you are looking for a very concentrated taste of coconut and pandan in the rice, which is the more common version of Nasi (Rice) in Nasi Lemak, then this is not for you. \n<br />-\n<br />The sambal in the dish are also different from the sweet ones you typically get. Instead, sambal belachan and coffee sambal, both made in house, are served. I was told that the coffee sambal is made with beans that the caf√© uses for their coffee.\n<br />-\n<br />You can choose to have your Nasi Lemak on its own for $2 or with Beef Rendang (Pictured), Chicken Rendang, Crispy Pork, Crispy Fried Chicken or 5 Spice Pork Confit. In any case, your gourmet Nasi Lemak will cost you less than $10. \n<br />-\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the invite and @revolutioncoffee @chefshentan for feeding us!
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />Shen-sational! The traditional classic chendol gets a Mod Sin spin for a chart-topping remix.\n<br />Weighty yet wobbly, the silky-smooth coconut pannacotta comes with gula melaka syrup and gorgeous green chendol. The red bean component\'s metamorphosised into a creamy ice-cream (churned in-house mind you), to complete this absolute delight of a dessert.
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />Where do I start? Everything on this plate was simply FAN-TAS-TIC!\n<br />Chef Shen Tan\'s famous tender beef shin rendang was as expected, aromatic to the nth degree, triggering mass nods of approval and murmurs of pleasure all around the table. Equally impressive but in an understated way was her twice-steamed coconut rice that\'s so fluffy and fragrant - I swear I\'m very happy to have it on its own with the freshly-fried crispy ikan bilis and her killer sambals. The darker one\'s a truly original creation as it has finely-ground Balinese coffee used in a carefully calibrated quantity. \n<br />Honestly, I still can\'t believe this costs $9.90 nett because the sheer amount of labour (and talent) that goes into this is immeasurable.

Nasi lemak.
The irresistibly fragrant and moist rice probably just emerged from a long and luxurious Cleopatra-esque (coconut) milk bath, while elsewhere the soft and tender pork confit yields to your chewing as surrenderingly as horny teenagers in a \"Friday the 13th\" film to Jason Voorhees. 4.2/5
BCM Pasta: looks like a pile of mess and nothing really visually engaging, but holy this plate of firey noodles were so damn good. Well cooked pasta, pretty damn spicy (and sweet) chili, generous slices of juicy BBQ pork, and ohmymama so much crispy lard. #Burpproved
This was definitely my sort of Bak Chor Mee ‚Äî thick tagliatelle that strangely bears the same yellow as our local Mee Pok in a piquant, vinegar-heavy sauce with crispy pork lard and the same 5 Spice Pork Confit from our Nasi Lemak order. Each slurp definitely brings out flavours reminiscent of Bak Chor Mee ‚Äî in fact it\'s much like having the real deal but with flavours way more intense; the way I like mine, while there were a good amount of crispy pork lard served here as compared to hawker stalls. Some might feel that it\'s pretty pricey for $19.90, but it\'s actually rather satisfying and filling for it comes loaded with a huge portion of noodles.
Revolution Coffee has seen a revamp in its menu which is released today with Chef Shen Tan at helm in the kitchen, rolling out her specialties such as Nasi Lemak and local mod-Sin pasta dishes along with desserts such as the Shendol here. If you are looking for an affordable eat, go straight away for the Nasi Lemak which starts from $4.90 nett with Crispy Fried Chicken ‚Äî the most expensive being priced at $9.90. The rice carried a hint of coconut aroma which was just right without being too heavy while maintained a light fluffiness while coming with crispy Ikan Bilis, omelette and tender slices of pork on the side that is marinated with coffee grounds and five spices. Two types of chip are also served alongside ‚Äî an espresso Sambal which is more roasty and earthy in flavour while slowly introducing the spiciness bit by bit within, and a housemade sambal  belachan which is moderately spicy while one could definitely taste the different ingredients into the making of it. Pretty much on par with the artisanal Nasi Lemak around of the late without the hefty price tag that it usually carries.
Chocolate taste was apparent, with not too much overpowering taste of milk. It was quite a nice evening blend of chocolatey and milky, which I quite enjoyed.
Service staff unfriendly. Nothing special - if didn\'t want to waste time don\'t even visit.

Simple Spaghetti Arrabiata with Al Dente pasta. Arrabbiata sauce was slightly spicy but could do with more spice. Overall 3/5 
Love the deep, robust flavour of chocolate and espresso, nicely sweet with the intoxicating aroma of roast coffee beans!
Much denser and smoother in texture than other versions, this home baked treat has a nice fruity sweetness, and goes well with the refreshing yoghurt dip!
The star is that thick, treacle-like palm sugar and butterscotch syrup, savoury and salty with notes of sweet, completely addictive! \n<br />The large, medium thick pancakes are fluffy, and the fresh banana slices help, though I wish there was more of it.
Croissant over baked, too crispy for me.. Food n coffee so so only but if u need a quiet place to hang out, away from the noise n crowd.
No matter what you say, the onions are obviously not caramelised. The colour is wrong and sour is not sweet. üò£
Suuuper moist with mashed banana chunks yet lightly toasted on the top!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />. \n<br />But since I have none... I\'m sad üò¢\n<br />P.S Where\'s my sprinkled sugar?
The Short Review
Tucked away¬†at Media Circle, Revolution Coffee with its¬†slightly inaccessible location is a nice quiet spot for some me-time. Winner of Burpple\'s Best Pancakes in 2013, the slightly chewy texture was nothing like the pancakes I tried before. Drenched in¬†an insanely delectable and¬†comforting¬†gula melaka butterscotch sauce, the dense yet soft thin pancakes could be eaten with just a spoon. The sauce was sedap, not too rich with just the right amount of sweet and together with the sliced bananas was like a party in my mouth.
Finally trying coffee + soymilk and it aint half bad üòä (good bonsoy makes a difference I guess!)
An affogato will keep you awake and cool. This particular one from @revolutioncoffeesg comes with a generous dusting of cocoa powder and a chocolate crumb beneath the ice cream. A better affogato experience indeed! \n<br />#burpple #revolutioncoffeesg
Topped with sliced fresh bananas, whipped coconut cream, and an insanely delicious gula melaka butterscotch sauce - this is nothing short of stunning. I\'ve always been the biggest fan of fluffy pancakes, but these thin dense and chewy ones have caught my heart with their superb flavours.
Finally got the time and luck to try out the widely raved Banana Bread here. Served warm, it was not too moist but still a rather dense bread with a crusty layer on the exterior. While there are banana chunks within, I still prefer the one from my regular coffee spot which is more mushy and comes with walnuts to crunch on. Still a pretty good option to try though.
The sweet and salty combination worked quite well, surprisingly. Thanks for the treat @kingdomformydonkey, lunch on me next! And...hang in there! üí™üèª #revolutioncoffeesg #burpple
It\'s a tad more dense than the usual pancakes I love, but it worked, and the flavours more than made up for it. A delicious pancake good on its own, topped with a stunning gula melaka butterscotch sauce. It\'d have been perfect if they were a wee fluffier.
2 scoops of French vanilla ice cream dusted with chocolate powder, over a bed of cookie crumble - all doused in a rich and fragrant shot of espresso. It\'s most definitely a dessert on its own, nothing like your usual affogattos. Stirred up it\'s like the most decadent coffee cookie milkshake. Too much yumz for my tumz.
Under the towering Infinite Studios building sits two great cafes, Revolution Coffee and Hoopla that offer great ambience and great makan, albeit being slightly out-of-the-way. 
FOC Affogatos on Wednesdays with every main that you order ‚úåÔ∏è what I really like about revo\'s affogatos is that they add cookie crumble at the bottom which somehow makes it turn from coffee sidekick to a legit dessert. Top marks to revolution for coming up with this mix!
The Short Review
This place is definitely way smaller than I thought it to be. Food is decent but not fantastic like how I read about. Perhaps I should have gone with zero expectation and the impression may have been better. Food and drinks are decent actually. Coffee can be stronger, I feel.  
The baked eggs came in either bacon or beef sausage and I like the fact that they added sweet potatoes and cheese gratin on the top. Overall a tad little dry but still pretty good, I would say!
Who doesn\'t love all-day breakfast? The big breakfast at Revolution Coffee came with either scrambled eggs or sunny side up, bacon or sausage, saut√©ed mushrooms, side salad and sourdough toast. Overall pretty decent for a typical breakfast dish, though the scrambled eggs came out slightly too milky than desired. 
Revolution Coffee is a hidden gem, situated at Infinite Studios at Media Circle, it\'s not easily accessible by public transport. With it\'s industrial design and laid back vibes, it\'s a great place to chill with a nice cuppa. They now open on weekends too! ‚òïÔ∏è
Piping hot bowl of mac &amp; cheese with added bacon is pure bliss on this rainy day! 
I got a shock when this was placed at my table, my first reaction - \"how am I gonna finish this?!\". Well I did, with a little help from my sister. That aside, everything stacked in between from the caramelised onions to the rockets, beef, cheese &amp; tomatoes went really well together. Worth my $12! 
Something special and I love the dark pancakes that are nicely done and presented; and I always love gula melaka in all forms!
Surprisingly quality food in this lost cafe tucked away safely from the world.
A very quiet place to spend quality time with my friends on a weekend over a meal. The waiting time can be shorten, but the food taste good! Especially their Mac &amp; Cheese and Caf√© Mocha.
gula melaka pancakes with bananas and a dash of coconut cream. didn\'t find this fantastic. de batter was rather bland. more gula melaka sauce needed. the coconut cream was a nono. \n<br />otherwise, the staff were duper friendly. great ambience away from the mountains of people.
very mehh.  the latte art wasn\'t impressive either. great ambience though. a good place to chill away frm de crowd, on this sunny sunday.
More pictures from my coffee appreciation workshop at #revolutioncoffeesg up on blog: qiuuing.wordpress.com.
Here\'s the Kalita Wave dripper that Revolution Coffee stocks up. If you are interested in dabbling in some hipster coffee-making, you may wanna get one of these! Drip coffee wasn\'t as difficult to make as I had imagined - just pour your choice of coffee grounds into the filter, and add hot water slowly. The coffee to water ratio (I think it\'s called grammage :b) Ajie uses at his cafe is 1:10, but you can also try 1:17. You\'d think the coffee will just be more dilute with a greater ratio, but noooo üò± When we used more water with the Colombian beans, the fruity notes of the beans were accentuated. So interesting! Drip coffee is light-tasting, and more like a tea than the coffee we are used to.
Another mouthwatering dish on the table, this is truly the definition of egg porn. Croquettes are crisp, yet gives way upon slight pressure. In it lies creamy mashed potato and bits of corner beef, combined w the runny yolk makes it brilliant! Must have, must try!

This fusion of otah and egg is so ridiculously yummy! The flavor of the otah isn\'t overpowering (which I usually dislike) and the eggs were ever so soft. Must try, must have! Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-tasting-revolution-coffee.html?m=0
Had a great time over here when I attended the coffee appreciation class held by the owner Ajie himself. Learnt some background knowledge bout coffee &amp; we had a hands-on experiment to brew the coffee beans of our choice. New food items on their new menu &amp; old favs were served too. Thankyou for having us! Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-tasting-revolution-coffee.html?m=0
I was busying myself with the corned beef hash and pancakes when this arrived, and I regret not eating more of this. Though the macaroni was baked in cheese and cream, there was still a bite to it, which I was really happy about because macaroni tends to turn mushy very easily. A mixture of 3 cheeses was used - mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan, which created a nice all rounded sauce both flavour and texture wise. I usually stay away from rich cheesy dishes (like quattro formaggi anything) so I\'d advise sharing it :)
Tender chunks of chicken exuding the quintessential smoky aroma of satay, heaped onto a bed of greens dressed in a zesty vinaigrette, and accompanied by a thick fragrant peanut sauce. I wish the sauce was sweeter, like the traditional ones, but it was satisfying in all other aspects. The white cubes are ketupat - how creative! Ajie explained that his customers wanted more carbs, so the cafe added ketupat to make this salad a more substantial meal. Think cafe food only comes in dainty portions? Not this one ;)
Croquettes, fried till crisp and golden brown, and topped with wobbly sunny side-ups. Each croquette consisted of creamy, silky mashed potatoes, and bits of savoury corned beef. Very well-balanced, hearty flavours.
It was fun learning how can you make your own filtered coffee at home! #burpple #tastemakers #vscocam
This is a winner!
Very soft fluffy pancakes, flavoured with orange zest, and perfect for mopping up that rich gula melaka butterscotch. Finally topped with a fragrant, lightly salted coconut cream, sliced banana and a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. Not too cloying for breakfast, but still very satisfying as a dessert. Everything is painstakingly made from scratch at Revolution Coffee.
Attended my very first tasting cum coffee appreciation session at Revolution Coffee, a cosy and fun space serving up delicious grub and a huge range of coffee and beans - perfect for the coffee connoisseur in you. Thanks Ajie and Sue for being wonderful hosts, and Burpple for organizing this! Also loved meeting fellow Burpplers for the first time :D 
Many thanks to Burpple for giving us the opportunity to attend interesting eatup sessions such as this Coffee Appreciation Workshop held at Revolution Coffee. Got to learn a lot today; from the factors affecting hand-brewed coffee, type of beans from all over the world and even a hands-on session, it was fun at the same time. Apart from coffee, we also had a take on some old favorites that regulars love as well as new dishes that are coming up on the menu soon. Stay tuned as Revolution Coffee refreshes its menu with some new east-meets-west creations!
A better photo of the dripper (right most).
I hope it isn\'t strange for a (usually) carnivorous me to rank a vegetarian dish as my favourite among the spread Ajie and his team generously prepared for us today... Cause this must be one of the best (yet really simple) appetizers I\'ve had! Juicy kernels of sweet corn were coated in a light batter, then deep fried into crisp and slightly chewy puffs of deliciousness. These fritters went superbly well with the homemade salsa that was the perfect balance of sweet and sour, and with a spicy kick ;) Definitely the dish to whet your appetite!
Chunks of otah and omelette wrapped in a tortilla. The omelette was insanely fluffy!!! The otah had a wonderful flavour and was melt-in-the-mouth, but texture-wise, I would have preferred chunks of fish in it, so as to contrast the softness of the egg. Like the others have said, this would make a great breakfast. Otah and egg... Am I the only one who\'s reminded of nasi lemak? üò≥
The runny yolk is just calling for me to poke it! Thanks @revolutioncoffeesg for hosting us and @burpple for coordinating! Had an enjoyable time!
Stuff that the owner himself prepared for us to bring home from the workshop. These stunningly designed bottles contains Cold Brew which were brewed by the owner himself, which we were honored to be the first to try out before they launch it on the menu. Each bottle contains a very concentrated concoction; recommended to have over milk or ice. It\'s got a caramel-like sweetness and floral accents as well; an interesting mix of flavours. Also presented to us are sample packets of assorted granola from Eastern Granola; got the Milo Granola which gives a chocolatey taste to it!
Fluffy pancakes w gula melaka, warm banana slices and fresh coconut cream to end off the day\'s tasting. A refreshing change from the usual pancake flavors in the market and the components also happens to be what I love which makes it even better! I would recommend this to end off a meal because its delightful yet not overly sweet. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-tasting-revolution-coffee.html?m=0
A refresh of an old-favorite with regulars here. Pancakes were drenched in sweet and fragrant Gula Melaka sauce and topped with bananas. They have added a coconut cream to further enhance the flavours which tasted near to whipped cream and did not come off as well as it used to.
Consists of 3 types of cheese, macaroni was soft and the cheese were still gooey and warm when we had it. The flavor of the cheese wasn\'t overwhelming and it gets better as I feast on it. Good example of yummy mac &amp; cheese. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-tasting-revolution-coffee.html?m=0
According to owner Ajie, their version uses a three-cheese recipe. The outer crust was a wee bit dry, but the inside was full of wet, stringy cheese stuck on macaroni.
This was very educational, especially to a coffee idiot like me. Thanks Burpple!
Revolution Coffee owner Ajie told us that this is probably half of the usual portion. My initial worries about it being too salty was gone when I had the first bite; the mild saltiness was evened out well with the potato chunks and when drenched with the broken yolk, it was simply indulgence.
Chicken satay paired w salad, for those who are health conscious yet wanna indulge in sinful food. This is an old fav amongst the customers there and I can see why. Portion is huge for many to share and and it goes w peanut sauce. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-tasting-revolution-coffee.html?m=0
Another one of the crowd favorites at Revolution Coffee. Well-marinated tender pieces of chicken matched with greens, tomatoes and Ketupat chunks for that local infusion. Comes with a peanut sauce to complete that local touch to the Grilled Chicken Salad.
Personally my favorite dish of the day. A wrap encasing a huge chunk of spicy Otah and fluffy egg omelette in between. My type of breakfast indeed!
Spiciness from the chili bits in the corn fritters adds on some flavor which prevented it from being plain. Munching onto the light, crispy batter was gratifying too. Plus points for the salsa which was really appetizing and yummy, all of us had praises for it. Read full review: http://glassnowflakes.blogspot.sg/2015/04/media-tasting-revolution-coffee.html?m=0
Fried Corn Fritters. These pops in the mouth when you chew past the corn bits, and the homemade tomato salsa was refreshing as it cleanses the palette with each mouthful
My attempt on hand-brewed coffee using Brazilian beans and the Kalita Wave dripper. Colour was light but I loved how that coffee aroma just adds on to itself with every sip!
Hey Tastemakers, one last slot for the Coffee Appreciation class this Saturday 4-6pm! Revolution Coffee owner Ajie will give you a new insight on coffee appreciation, and improve your coffee making skills at home with this hands-on experience. Simply comment here if you\'re interested, and we\'ll send you a confirmation :)
The pancakes tasted like flour and eggs...I didn\'t like the waffles themselves that much. But the gula Melaka was very rich and sweet, and made the pancakes nicer, in a way. Kind of pricy for three pancakes, though. 
Best coffee to have at anytime of the day! Go try go!!
One of the better pancakes around!!! Fluffy pancakes l and the Gula Melaka sauce was it man. Super good combo with the bananas as well. Just that the place is pretty ulu (but that doesn\'t mean it\'s inaccessible! You can take 191 from buona vista/one north mrt) the portion was big. By the time I finished, I didn\'t have space for the sticky date pudding. Now I\'ve a legit reason to go back üòèüòè
Not much to fault for a decent brunch fare. The coffee was really worth the drive here! 
Situated in the middle of nowhere in infinite studios building at media circle. Love the offbeat vibe.
Thick toast with lots of whipped cream and berries and jam..
sticky date pudding with vanilla ice cream and gula melaka!
One of the better banana bread around!Spot that gooey caramelised banana goodness?I love to dig for banana chunks in any banana bake-goods. I\'m weird like that. Paired this with butter instead of the yoghurt. Does remind me of my favourite banana bread in Melbourne! üçåüçå
Not a big portion. I had a fair share of late breakfast before this, so this is ok for me. Basically, anything with bacon goes.
My hot chocolate. The barista was kind enough to attempt coffee art on it. In terms of taste, I still prefer that of D\'good Cafe.
I liked this simple dish. The eggs were runny and the bread was toasted perfectly.
@afen14 latte from Revolution Coffee. The place is ok but don\'t think we will go back again.
Brunch with the fun bunch @katyangelstar @moimou and @afen14. It took a while for us to find this place, in a rather secluded corner at Media Circle. Not a very convenient place if you don\'t have a car.
Pancakes are my breakfast-must haves. And of course, some desserts to go along. 
Heart breakfast with a good friend in the early afternoon; life is good. 
Not too sweet &amp; paired with salted caramel drizzle + ice cream makes a good combination! 
Layers of bacon + an interested sweet sauce! üëç
A cup of mocha for the sunny Sunday. PS: the service here is great!
Doesn\'t Rachel make them sound delectable? \'Pancakes with Gula Melaka Butterscotch. The salted gula melaka (palm sugar) over those plush pancakes is to die for. I walloped more than half of this. Just. Couldn\'t. Stop. Eating. For non-Singaporeans, \"shiok\" is a word to describe a feeling of utter bliss.\' Photo by Rachel Xie.
Nice fluffy pancakes though shld drizzy more gula melaka will be even nicer.
So good! This salad is definitely my go to salad when I step into revolution... And the pumpkin soup is a creamy cup of joy! 
The most perfect, mouth watering, smile provoking, happy tummy inducing banana bread I\'ve ever had! If you happen to get it fresh out of the oven, you are gonna feel your entire body tickling with joy, and if it happens to cool down, it doesn\'t loose it\'s magic. Completely addictive! Like my friend Jayne says: It\'s made with awesomeness!! A must try!! 
Pour the warm expresso shot into the cold vanilla ice cream on top of crumbles... And you get an amazing end to a meal. Love the strong coffee taste! 
The really delicious warm banana bread. Dig in and be in a state of bliss
Bite into this chicken satay sandwich full of flavours. I taste peanut butter under the bread and surprising it tastes really good together! 
Okay the name is wrong and I can\'t seem to find the menu... But this salad is amazing. Filled with chick peas and warm zucchini it makes a great healthy meal
House blend with coffee beans from Sydney. Really really good coffee and I\'m not kidding! 
So good, right balance of the sweetness of the caramelized onion and saltiness of the broth! Yummerz!
Wanted to take away but I couldn\'t resist after smelling it. Really good banana bread that feels and taste like cake! 
One of their weekly specials. Huge beef burger which tasted rather mediocre and messy to eat. Comes with shoestring fries which were barely seasoned.
Revolution Coffee\'s take on the well-loved combination of Espresso and Vanilla ice-cream, which also included cookie crumbs for a bite which definitely was a great combination altogether.
A cupcake with a nice crusty exterior marred by the use of dry bananas and a slightly dry cake. Loved the soft walnuts which was nice to chew though.
Totes yummers sandwiches go so well with great coffee üòç wish they had weekday pancakes too~

Just the team having fun.. and decided to take over the newly opened Revolution Coffee. Do check it out! Closes by 5pm on weekdays though so get going now.
My dream to be a barista fulfilled.. Almost!
At the new Revolution Coffee. Awesome people, good coffee, satisfying food. You can catch a free shuttle from the one-north bus stop! 
Was worried that the serving might be a tad too small but this was really filling!
Beef sandwich with caramelized onions, flat white and spaghetti amatriciana. #burpple team lunch !
Dropped by the new Revolution Coffee for lunch! Nice place, good coffee, decent food. #burpple
the nasi lemak however was unimpressive and the chicken was very salty.
I can go with anyhing that do with Chendol, Gula Melaka, Coconut.\n<br />.\n<br />Location : revolutioncoffeesg 21 Media Circle, Infinite Studio, #01-03A, Singapore 138562\n<br />.\n<br />#revolutioncoffeesg #burpple #burpplesg #coconutpannacotta #sgcafehopping #cafehopping #sgcafefood

Fusion Nasi Lemak, Gula Melaka Banana Pancake, Truffle fries, Coconut Pannacotta and a Cup of Mocha!\n<br />.\n<br />Location : revolutioncoffeesg 21 Media Circle, Infinite Studio, #01-03A, Singapore 138562\n<br />.\n<br />#revolutioncoffeesg #burpple #burpplesg #nasilemak #bananapancake #trufflefries #mocha #coconutpannacotta
Read good reviews about this interesting cafe that have local delights in fusion style, decided to give it a try on this Saturday noon. Ordered Buah Keluah Pasta and a cup of cappuccino. The food looks good but it turn out to be a total disappointment. Firstly, the heat in the food was uneven - some part of the Pasta is warm, some part was not. Same goes to the pork in it, some pieces were warm and some were not. It made me think the food was pre-cooked and it was just heated up when ordered. Obviously, the heating up process was not even done thoroughly which explained the uneven in the temperature of the whole plate of food. The only comfort was the cup of cappuccino. The concept of the cafe was good but if the standard cannot be kept up to, it failed.

An innovative Peranakan twist to a pasta dish. They had kinda tuned down the taste of the otherwise heavy but distinctive Buah Keluak flavour, perhaps to make it more palatable to the masses. However, I wished it was stronger like how it was meant to be. They also included some fatty pork bites in the dish, which I wished could be more crispy to add some texture to the pasta. Otherwise, this was a quite an interesting eat. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #buahkeluak #peranankan #pasta
tried the the 5-Spice Pork Confit and i must declare this as way better than the Fried Chicken. the meat is flavorful and tender even if it looks dry on the exterior and the rice, as expected, is aromatic and especially üëçüèº when paired with the power-packed sambal chili \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @revolutioncoffeesg #revolutioncoffeesg #revolutioncoffee #dessert #jiaklocal #eatlocal @chefshentan #nasilemak
But contrary to many raving reviews, what we tasted today was nothing good as it sounded like. \n<br />Conceptually, the idea of Kueh Dadar for the crepe was apt and innovative. However, the layers of crepe were dry and hard. The cream in between tasted little of coconut and was missing the generous amount of Gula Melaka that we were promised. The cake just didn\'t taste fresh. It wasn\'t hard for us to see that their cake was kept open in their fridge with many other items, which probably explained why it was so dry, hard and stale. \n<br />Tried their other items such as their Nasi lemak, Buah Keluak pasta and Shendol panna cotta which similarly sounded enticing but failed in execution. Really a pity after having read so much good reviews and seen many beautiful pictures of their food. Reality bites. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #kueh #millecrepe

Interesting but think I prefer the traditional way it\'s eaten. On a separate note, their nasi lemak is really good - rice was fluffy and I can\'t stop myself after first mouth. #fatdieme #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgig #igsg #instafoodsg #foodspotting #foodpornsg #foodiesg #insiderfood #burpple #8dayseat #sgeats #whati8today #instafood_sg #foodpornsg
this is the Fried Chicken rendition (SGD4.90) and although the omelette was far too salty, the chicken was perfecto (don\'t mind its colour), especially when paired with the power sambal chilli! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #revolutioncoffeesg #revolutioncoffee #jiaklocal #eatlocal #RevoluSHEN #nasilemak #friedchicken
the pannacotta is smooth and rich yet it doesn\'t leave you with the feeling like you\'ve overeaten, whilst the ice cream, with its whole red beans, is of the right balance of sweetness that complements the main item of the dessert. this is truly a #RevoluSHEN by @chefshentan üôåüèº @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @revolutioncoffeesg #revolutioncoffeesg #revolutioncoffee #dessert #jiaklocal #eatlocal #pannacotta #icecream
Hence I have to made the hard choice of choosing Shen\'s latest creation Buah Keluak Pasta ($19.90). The al dente tagliatelle pasta is tossed in house made buah keluak sauce, minced prawns and minced pork. It is also served with fork tender and juicy twice cooked pork belly (poached and pan seared). This is a delightful take of incorporating Asian flavours into Italian past.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #buahkeluahpasta #revolutioncoffeesg

There is a choice of Crispy Pork, Fried Chicken, Spice Pork Confit, Beef Rendang and Chicken Rendang.\n<br />.\n<br />I tried the Nasi Lemak with Crispy Pork ($7.90) which is served with ikan billis, omelette, housemade sambal belachan and coffee sambal on cool cucumber slices. If you have tried Chef Shen\'s nasi lemak, you would know that the fragrant rice is twice steamed. Unlike others that steamed the rice with coconut milk, she used fresh coconut. It resulted in a soft and fluffy lemak rice with aromatic scent. Not to forget the deep fried slices of pork belly that is marinated in a secret marinade, that was crispy and juicy.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #revolutioncoffee #nasilemak
but it\'s certainly a combo which works.. the fried pork is essentially \'shao rou\' or crispy roast pork. Rice is good and unique as I mention in my previous post.. an enjoyable plate I must say.. If the side dishes are fried just before it\'s serve and if the samba is tastier then this could easily be one of the top ranking Nasi lemak in sg!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#roastpork#nasilemaksg#revolutioncoffee#coconutrice#nasilemak#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending

it\'s reminiscent of  International Nasi lemak from Changi Village before it was renovated and relocated. It has this onion flavour from the rice which I find it refreshing and compliments the coconut taste.. the eggs are a treat too as they are omelette instead of the usual sunny side.. Chicken, (although my plate seems less) is quite tasty too.. Well, other than the slightly cold dishes, this plate of Nasi lemak is easily one of my favoritesüëçüèΩ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#friedchicken#nasilemaksg#revolutioncoffee#coconutrice#nasilemak#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
This rendition of pulot hitam has successfully made me cheat on my diet plan and, most importantly, on (even my favourite) sticky date pudding. The gula melaka butterscotch was far from being cloyingly sweet and jelat, while the pulot hitam pudding was the epitome of perfection ‚Äî with generous grains of pulot hitam that made every bite very flavourful and chewy in texture. To complete the dessert, it was served with a scoop of home-made coconut ice cream to recreate the traditional image of pulot hitam dessert. I am definitely biased when declaring this as my most-favourite dessert, but imo, this is hands-down the best local fusion dish I\'ve tried thus far.\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @revolutioncoffeesg for the warm hospitality and @chefshentan for your wonderful creations.

Missed the Shendol which was out of stock when Chef Shen Tan popped up at Artistry the last round so I was stoked seeing this on the menu. This certainly did not disappoint ‚Äî the coconut Panna Cotta was smooth, silken and creamy; requires no effort to cut how effortlessly the fork glides into the Panna Cotta without the pudding losing its shape. Drenched in Gula Melaka, the entire dessert felt balanced in terms of sweetness while the Pandan jelly carried the coconuty aroma pretty well; paired with a reasonably earthy red bean ice-cream on the side that comes with bits of soft, Azuki beans that were of the same smooth and creamy texture of the ice-cream itself. Pretty much a clear winner for one of the best Panna Cotta around, and with a local twist!

Not the typical teabag in a pot of hot water, but aromatic earl grey tea leaves immersed in hot water. The bagel was well toasted and paired well with the juicy bacon strips. However, nothing in the big breakfast set managed to impress me as it tastes almost similar to other cafes. Quiet and cosy cafe with really friendly staff. Ideal place for catch up with friends.
