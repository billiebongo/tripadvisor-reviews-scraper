Seared sous-vide chicken breast, almond, pomegranate, baby spinach, avocado &amp; quinoa without dressing #eatcleannotdiet
The guacamole and hummus were fresh &amp; yummy. However I felt like there were too many flavours going on at once what with the sweet tomato salsa and yuzu vinaigrette sides that didn\'t really go well with the other components\n<br />📍@botanist.sg, 74 Neil Road S088839
But first, I need to laze in bed some more. Head over to @botanist.sg only after like 2pm. 😅 I can\'t get enough of their breakfast platter. Soooooo satisfying.
NO GST. NO SERVICE CHARGE!
Beautiful... that\'s all.
Not sure what meat those were but it was an utterly aweful plate of disappointment.... zuk zuk zuk...
The portion is too huge even with two people we can\'t finished it .
Yes! It is.\n<br />Though $23, the prices here are nett.\n<br />Everything\'s well executed. Can\'t find fault except maybe the bacon could be thinner and crisper.\n<br />Definitely for sharing.\n<br />So with this and good cuppa here, today we know we started our weekend right.
A classic case of #forthegram: The toast was slightly thick and a bit too sweet for my liking, but definitely a filling meal to share between two\n<br />.\n<br />I also just realised I\'ve got a decade of cafés to catch up on. 😂 If anyone is keen to go cafe-hopping, drop me a DM!
I\'m not being overly dramatic when I say this is one of the best French toasts I\'ve had in Singapore. The brioche was pillowy soft and yet had beautifully crunchy bits of caramelised crust. They were super generous with the not-too-sweet berry compote and fresh berries. And instead of almond flakes we got macadamia nuts! The whole dish wasn\'t too sweet as well. Highly suggest having it served later in the meal if you\'re sharing it with friends cos in the sweltering heat that ice cream melts crazy fast.
This was really quite a solid plate of food, both in size and standard. $23 is on the pricier side but they don\'t charge GST or service charge (yay!). Loved how there was half an avocado and basically 10 different things on the plate. They used the word \"platter\" for good reason - and it lived up to it. Super creamy scrambled eggs too.
Visited on an extremely hot day - we really felt like we were in a sauna under the canopy. If the temperature was five degrees cooler everything would have been perfect. These corn fritters were fresh and yummy, though I expected them to be thinner and crispier). I usually love hummus and I didn\'t like this one at all - it tasted more like mashed beans, and was missing some salt and acidity. That egg was perfectly poached though! I think the dish would have been better balanced with two poached eggs and two corn fritters (instead of three fritters).
.\n<br />Hahaha fret not, this bowl of {Tagliatelle Carbonara} is much more pleasant to the tummy than the eyes. With chock full of ingredients such as bacon, mushroom, and a sous-vide egg, this pasta is as hearty as it can get! It\'s slightly on the wetter side (you can see the light cream that looks like a broth) which I\'m guessing that\'s why they served it in a bowl...? A plate would\'ve been easier to eat but oh well, it was polished clean anyway 😆
This beautiful cafe along Neil Road (enter via the sidedoor at the alley) holds just as much Insta-potential as its popular sister cafe, Pacamara Boutique Coffee Roasters at Upper Thomson, and the food here is just as good. There are limited indoor seats, so dress cool to sit outdoors where draping plants line the wall, and order a five-ounce Flat White ($5, opt for Dark Matter as your preferred blend of beans — it\'s got hints of dark chocolate and macadamia nuts) while you deliberate your main. Portions run big, so it\'s best to share. The lusciously rich Slow Cooked Beef Cheek ($24) is the most expensive item on the menu and with good reason — set on a bed of truffle mash, the chunky slab of beef cheek is braised to be so unbelievably tender! The Breakfast Platter ($23) is a meat lover\'s breakfast dream come true. There\'s toast, bratwurst sausage, avocado, streaky bacon, mushroom, eggs — you name it, it\'s there! Prices are nett, there is no service charge and reservations are not allowed, so head down early. \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Zhihui Lim
Egg Florentine, portobello mushroom, wilted spinach, avocado, poached egg, tomatoes, chive hollandaise, toast.
Pretty and delicious dish. Great toast, guacamole was delicious and super generous, and the dish was topped up with additional cubes of fresh avocado. Loved the beetroot cubes and sweet cherry tomatoes on top as well. One strange thing was that the guac was really salty towards the end, until my lips were smarting from salt overload. I think someone may have topped up an empty salt grinder with pepper (pic in background), because I added a lot of black pepper on my own and a salt and pepper mixture came out as a result.
Gorgeously topped with a flawless fried egg for additional points in this elegantly fashionable presentation, the cherry tomatoes, edible flowers &amp; greens were also accessories to make a perfect statement. Overall a creamy, addictive &amp; wonderfully seasoned piece of art, one of those times my taste buds thanked me wholeheartedly.\n<br />.\n<br />Dare to say this has easily found its way into my personal list as one of the best brunches I\'ve had in awhile, no need for more words. Originally came to enjoy their French toast, which was unavailable &amp; I got so upset, but didn\'t expect other items to taste so extraordinary good. The general vibe of this cafe was incredible, relaxing garden theme which goes well with the menu items, perfect location where you can get to enjoy weekend brunch everyday (except Mondays). Happened to also unintentionally sniffed out possibly the strongest whiff of truffle from the truffle fries ordered by other customers nearby. Honestly have not tried, but it\'s a sin not to come back, so see you again! &amp; Oh, happy Sunday folks!
Aaaa already dreaming of the baked eggs \n<br />Totally forgot about the \"album\" feature\n<br />#burpple
Nice place to chill out. Service was great. Food was reasonably good! The coffee could have done better with an extra shot. Will be back to try the remaining of the menu. 
$8\n<br />I think I ordered just shoestring fries? Inconsistency in crispiness..
One of the famous western breakfast or brunch choice that reminds me the days back in Australia.
For $23 it definitely worth for such a huge portion. Comes with salad, sausage, scramble egg, hash brown, bread, corn and mushroom.
If you like skinny fries, littered with finely grated Parmesan cheese and drizzled with truffle oil - this is for you! This is an $8 side dish for sharing.
Seafood lovers will love the freshness of the ingredients used for this pasta. It tastes and smells much healthier than the truffle smell that emancipates from the kitchen. Located at a quiet (pretty too!) alley along Neil Road, Botanist is a lovely place for catch-up with friends.
Although food may be slightly pricey, there is no gst &amp; service charge! Portion is huge and of good quality. We love what we ordered! The breakfast set includes a special made strawberry jam while the beef burger topped with charcoal bun comes with a perfectly cooked sunny side up! The iced mocha was good too. Sitting directly under the blue sky, with natural lighting added to the overall positive experience. Sadly it closes at 6pm ):
toast, grilled corn, bratwurst sausage, avocado, hash, thick cut streaky bacon, mushroom, tomato, greens &amp; scrambled eggs
Love the walls, love the deco, love this cuppa 5 oz flat white. Dont judge on svc, they dont chg svc fee. Wished i had the luxury to spend the whole afternoon here. Coffee available in black and white, 3 or 5 or 7 oz. Mocha is decent too. Definitely thick and good.
The nicoise salad, generous portion of protein (tuna), greens, cherry tomatoes, olives, avocado, potatoes w mayonnise. Yes i admit, it can be healthier by changing to a lighter dressing. Definitely a filing lunch that kept me full for 5-6 hrs. Salt and pepper at the side for customers who need some extra taste. Sgd17 no svc chg. They can improve on service turnover as well
This is exactly what $60 affords you at The Botanist. This quaint set-up delivers what I would describe as one of the more exceptional brunches in Singapore. The fried brioche in the French Toast dish is on fleek, being superbly crisp. The ice cream and berries just makes the whole dish ideal for the gram. As if that isn\'t enough to win you over, the slow coked beef cheek with truffle mash was perfectly cooked with the beef being adequately tender for the lazy morning chewed. On top of that, the folks at The Botanist definitely meant it when they said truffle mash. My friends and I cleaned up every dollop of that truffle goodness and no, I\'m not exaggerating. Having saved the best for last, the corn-fritters are definitely my favorite. In fact, it\'s been the only constant that I\'ve had in all my past 5 visits here. It\'s almost on par with the corn fritters I\'ve had in Melbourne and mind you, that says a lot. All in all, my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this relatively new establishment. Ps- these 3 dishes are enough to fill up 4 average eaters.
I\'ll admit, I was sold by the pretty plating. But thankfully it tasted as good as it looked. Great coffee and chill ambiance makes it all the better.
Soft fluffy brioche French toast with generous amount of berries! 😍\n<br />Baked eggs could do with a little more bread but overall a good meal 👌🏻 we\'ll be backkk
Corn fritters, salsa, guac and a too sweet hummus. I think I\'m done with the cafés. #foodporn #burpple #botanistsg
Gosh this place is just beautiful. The food, the setting, the ambience, absolutely love it. Got some French toast for breakfast (they don\'t charge GST or service charge!) the toasts were slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The berries were super refreshing with a mix of sweet and sour flavours. The dish was drizzled with maple syrup and topped off with a scoop of ice cream (:
Outdoor garden seating; a natural enclave in the middle of our concrete jungle.\n<br />Tip: Green walls soothe the nerves. (And so does the outdoor aircon unit)
An excellent brioche slice, with the fluffiness and lightness of cake, and the crispness of baked bread; a toast to toasts.\n<br />Complemented by a fine selection of berries.
-\n<br />A jazzed-up version of French toast; complete with fresh berries and edible flowers. One of the prettiest French toasts I have had.\n<br />-\n<br />PS: I love the poached pear!\n<br />-\n<br />#botanistsg #neilroad #frenchtoast
😍👍 Fluffy pancakes with nuts gave a good crunchy texture, cold slab of butter to go with the pancakes and thick piece of bacon 🥓 for a filling and more savoury mea ! Oh, we loved the outdoor dining area too !
Breakfast Platter ($23) was overwhelmingly huge and the works were pretty worth its price considering how everything was quite well-executed. Crisp hash, buttery juicy sautéed mushrooms, scrambled eggs and we loved the sausages. Bacon, again, was on the hard side. Served with a good tub of jam that wasn\'t overly sweet so I stole some for my pancakes too 😛 
Loved how the fluffy pancakes were incorporated with assorted nuts that gave a good crunch and nutty fragrance; topped with light creme fraiche, maple syrup and fresh berries. And a guilt-inducing slab of butter that made the pancake even better. Liked the idea of savoury component with the thick slab of bacon but it was slightly hard. Overall, a beautiful combination of sweet, sour and savoury. 
Topped with assorted berries &amp; a nice slab of bacon with loads of maple, you\'ve got yourself something sweet, a side of sour &amp; some savoury as well! \n<br />Just remember to share this as it does get quite filling after awhile! \n<br />Cheers to the last work day of the year 🙌🏼
🍽: Corn fritters •\n<br />Price: $18.00 •\n<br />🚇: Outram 📍: 74 Neil Road\n<br />•\n<br />Never would I expect myself to love vegetarian dishes, but these corn fritters totally changed my perspective. •\n<br />The corn fritters were pan-fried to golden crispy brown, but it was light. The corn still retains its juiciness and bursts sweetness in your mouth. When coated with the oozing poached egg, it changes the complex of the food into something savoury. •\n<br />The part where I was skeptical was the hummus. This was my first time trying and I did not quite like it.\n<br />•\n<br />Overall, botanist may be on the pricey side due to the quality of food. It is still one of my favourite brunch places to go to.
Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages and toast are probably the most basic items - checked! But this has grilled corn (!!), avocado, sautéed mushrooms, hash browns, salad and a whole tub of jam 😻
•\n<br />These succulent beef cubes fell apart effortlessly beneath our forks, and worked wonders with the complementing sides of truffle mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables!\n<br />•\n<br />Perfect for a rainy Christmas Eve!
i thought the pancakes were too thick to enjoy and definitely better to share. the salmon dish was nice but nothing too special; on the other hand my friend seemed to enjoy the eggs florentine mmmm the menu has loads of food and really does make me wanna go back and try the rest even tho they didn\'t leave the big an impression after my first trip.\n<br />(just a word of caution: this place is really hard to find if you are using google maps so just keep your eyes open for the sign)
Slow cooked for hours, the meat tears away easily with a gentle prod of the fork. Served with truffle mash (!!!), broiled carrots, brinjal and a handful of flowers 🌸🌺🌷💐! A must-order for all beef lovers.
Have a tantalizing Thursday my dears 💋
Another great truffles fries, I almost cancelled this order but thankfully didn\'t. It was nicely fried till crispy without an overdose of truffle oil.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I like the balance in the amount of cheese, truffle oil and fries, none being excessive. And with the shoestring fries coming out hot and crispy, it\'s one of the better truffle fries I had.. And at $8 without having to pay gst and service charge? That makes it the best!
Confession: I already had a sip before I took this photo, not expecting myself to post coffee shots. But this cappuccino was so good. It has a pleasant chocolatey bitterness and a subtle taste of my favourite macadamia nuts.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Now I want to drop by The Alchemist more often to takeaway their coffees, and this Dark Matter in particular. It\'s my kind of coffee.
Botanist joins Epiphyte and Knots Coffee as the latest garden theme cafe.  These garden cafes are so beauty that they\'ve inspired me to bring greenery into my new place too.\n<br />🔸\n<br />We ordered a dessert for mains, not realizing it came with vanilla ice cream. Soft brioche fried to an external crisp then layered internally with rhubarb berry marmalade before topping off with fresh berries and almond flakes, served alongside poached pear and that vanilla ice cream.\n<br />🔸\n<br />It\'s pretty nice, not too sweet nor sour. It\'s very filling though, so be sure to share.
Beautiful afternoon, we were seated under natural light which filled this garden themed cafe with a breath of fresh air and optimism.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The mix of tomato relish with feta cheese is given a umami boost with bits of chorizo iberico and bacon. And of course, an egg is hidden beneath this homely pot, brought into the light by my hand model Mya.
Another weekend is coming and we can indulge to our hearts content~
Generous portion of brunch items which complements each other snugly. Not too overwhelming in taste but well balanced out with the sweet corn and juicy tomatoes! One of the \'big breakfast\' that will keep you going till the end!
This Baked Egg is one of the more decent versions I had of late.
Nutty stringy Gruyere cheese and classic ham slices packed within toasted brioche finish with a fried egg on top!
While the brioche was soft and buttery and the nuts elicit Nutella-esque pleasures, the pear was the only pillar of refreshment standing juicy, wet and fat amidst the smorgasbord of assorted berry elements, which positively smoulder you with their tart and very sweet glory like a lady\'s ample b...(let\'s stop right there - Decency Editor). 3.6/5
The very Chinese-tasting pasta reveals its infused oceanic charms as you delve deeper, but the presence of unremoved Number Two within the tired, wizened prawns casts some shade on the $23 plate. 3.5/5
If you choose your Saturday brunch destination based on ambience and Insta-potential as much as its food, you will love Botanist. The sister cafe to the ever-crowded Pacamara Boutique Coffee Roasters at Upper Thomson, this cosy 40-odd seater is a hit amongst the younger crowd. Dress cool to sit outdoors where draping plants line the wall, and order a five-ounce Flat White ($5) while you deliberate your main. Portions run big, so it\'s best to share. The lusciously rich Slow Cooked Beef Cheek ($24) is the most expensive item on the menu and with good reason — set on a bed of truffle mash, the chunky slab of beef cheek is so tender it falls right off the bone. For flowy eggporn, opt for the tasty Corn Fritters ($18) served with tomato salsa, guacamole and hummus. The hearty Breakfast Platter ($23) has hash, streaky bacon and bratswurst sausage to name a few — a fail-proof option the guys will enjoy. Prices are nett and there is no service charge. Pro-tip: Head down early to avoid disappointment. \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hilary See
Run by the folks behind @pacamara_sg and @alchemist.sg, this new cafe is hidden within the stretch of shophouses along Neil Road with a side entrance. Beautiful outdoor dining area with one wall covered in greenery, you can expect same flair and standard for food or coffee.
Wasn\'t expecting portions to be this huge! 😱😳 My dining partner struggled to finish this — happy problem tho since the beef cheek was so thick and chunky!! 👍🏻👍🏻 Definitely value for money if two small eaters shared this! Love the truffle mash and the slow cooked carrots and mushrooms! #Burpproved
For a refreshing change from all that usual eggs Benedict cafe food! LOVE how hearty the portions are at Botanist (sharing is caring!) and everything\'s so tasty! I had corn fritters (three pieces) that came with a poached egg on the side, guacamole, salsa and hummus! SUPER yum when you have a bit of everything on your fritters! #Burpproved
From Botanist situated at 74 Neil Road, opened by the folks behind Pacamara Boutique Coffee Roasters and Knockhouse Supply Co.
Botanist uses coffee beans roasted by Knockhouse Supply Co. located within the same location as Botanist; choose between the Dark Matter blend or the single origin — opted for the latter which was of a lighter roast. A smooth, creamy cuppa with a light body and nutty flavour profile that works with a leisurely brunch.
Pretty much the familiar deal available since the now-defunct OZ Specialty Coffee and Pacamara Boutique Cofffee Roasters. The big breakfast comes pretty hearty and wholesome with eggs (scrambled, poached or fried), grilled tomato, grilled corn, sausage, bacon, sautéed mushrooms, greens, avocado on toast and hashbrown with a small jar of jam on the side. Overall the quality is pretty decent and on par with Pacamara Boutique Coffee Roasters here — pretty satisfying and works for a comforting but filling brunch dish. The only difference here would be the slab of bacon that\'s of a thicker cut; juicy with loads of bite and pretty savoury — great for meat lovers like me!

It’s like an alternative to wild honey for breakfast brunch cravings!!! They have a good range of vegetarian options clearly noted in their menu:) their coffee is from pacamara roasters:) I’m very impressed by their food deco for their price! It’s slightly cheaper than wild honey and the portion is pretty generous as well! The place is comfortable and got corners for instashots!

French Toast ($18) - fried brioche, rhubarb berry marmalade, fresh berries, almond flakes, poached pear, vanilla ice-cream. One of the best French Toast I have ever tasted. Everything just went so well together. I was impressed the ice-cream did not melt much even after a period of time.                                                                               Breakfast Platter ($23) - toast, grilled corn, bratwurst sausage, avocado, hash, thick cut streaky bacon, mushroom, tomato, scrambled eggs. Loved the eggs as it was nicely done and creamy. The streaky bacon tasted like crispy sio bak. The mushrooms were juicy and flavorful. The best was the bratwurst sausage. When I cut through it, the juices just burst out.                           P/S: Skip the Iced Chocolate as the taste was not worth its price.
I ordered the highly recommended Breakfast Platter and got them to change the corn to salad coz hard to eat corn with braces. I have nothing to complain about this well executed platter. The platter consists of bratwurst sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, mushrooms, hashbrown, salad, avocado, bread and framboise macker raspberry jam. Everything on it was good but i didn\'t eat the avocado. lol :x This cost $23 which i find slightly on the pricier side? But maybe it will make you feel better if you share it? ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ✨#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah ah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower

Quinoa with Chicken(served on other plate as i was having it with a vegan) -chicken a bit dry but taste-wise it was good, quinoa cooked nicely as well with a hint of sourness to it
Finish it all off (or like us, u can choose to start ur meal with) with a fruity french toast, crisp on the outside while buttery soft on the inside mixed with a galore of sweet and appetising berries.

An excellent brioche slice, the toast were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It was drizzled with maple syrup, with berries, almond flakes &amp; served along side poached pear and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream..\n<br />•\n<br />It\'s very nice. Not too sweet nor sour. It\'s very filling though, so be sure to share. \n<br />#burpple
Cozy garden outdoor.
Happy Monday all!
•\n<br />The aftertaste however, rekindle memories of stale lemon slices.\n<br />•\n<br />P.S.: I\'ve never felt so free in my life! 🤥

Started out w normal food (not really), followed by a whole tub of ice cream, then truffle fries + soup which was ok, &amp; ended up w a choco nut cake w ice cream. Is it I out of control kid? 😥 I need to stop sinning like this 😶
Baked Egg.
Words can\'t describe how incredibly delectable this piece of steak from @botanist.sg is!\n<br />•\n<br />That gorgeous sear on the exterior only served to entice us even further as the meat was perfectly cooked to match our medium-rare requirement! ❤️\n<br />•\n<br />The cook on the vegetables was equally applaudable, whereas the sautéed mushrooms were simply bursting of earthiness; so addictiveeee! I kid you not!\n<br />•\n<br />The price? Only 25 bucks for this impressive steak package! What a steal indeed! 😋💕

Aestically pleasing to the eyes with toothsome fruits such as strawberries, raspberries and poached pears as well as the velvety vanilla ice cream to go with the savoury french toast smattered in nectarous honey. Lip smackingly sweet and candied.
🔸🔹\n<br />The coffee was chocolaty, low acidity with a nutty finish. Nice! \n<br />#coffeetime #coffeegram #latteart #hungrygowhere #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #botanistsg #cafesg #cafehoppers
The tart rhubarb berry marmalade sealed the deal and balanced out the sweet flavours nicely. #burpple #cafe #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #brunch #dessert

With the luscious and chunky beef cheeks and the final flourish of the greens, you cant stop raving about this dish
Dip the toast in this palatable mix to absorb the essence and then indulge in the remnants after. This lovely concoction will activate your tastebuds for the other dishes

🔸🔸\n<br />It is sweet, alittle citrussy and tangy. Quite nice actually. This is a generous portion so best to share with bff.
Walnuts hidden within the pancake batter causing the overall texture to be dense and slightly chewy. Fresh berries were a plus. Candied bacon was the savior.\n<br />Yes , the plate was served this way with the cream \"fallen\" off. They had initially served it to the wrong diners. Gave them a chance to rectified it but alas 🙅‍♂️. Finger prints on the plates - no no.\n<br />Good coffee and ambience but food failed me on three very different dishes on two separate occasions.\n<br />⭐️: 🌝🌝🌜\n<br />📍Botanist\n<br />74 Neil Road\n<br />🇸🇬Singapore 088839\n<br />🚗Coupon along Teck Lim\n<br />.\n<br />#sgwanderlust #igsg #sgig #sgfoodblogger #sgbrunch #brunch #cafe #pancakes #dessert #sweet #foodpic #foodie #sgfood #sgeats #sgfoodie #instafoodie #foodblogger #botanist #cafe #sgcafe #wanderlust #feedfeed #burpple

The Botanist .. a cozy cafe opened with a \"garden\" theme. Alfresco area with surrounding greenery. Indoor with a \"concrete jungle\" look and an upstairs level which is retail and a roastery.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Baked egg rests nicely on top with chorizo iberico, tomato relish, feta cheese, baby spinach and bacon toast for dunking. Egg was alittle runny. But when you dived into the tiny pot, the elements tantalises your palate with various wonderful sweet sour and cheesy finishes. We did enjoy a somewhat teeny pot which had the capability of filling your tummy.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />A big shoutout and mighty thanks to @danielfooddiary for the treat and being my handmodel. It was an enjoyable afternoon.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />There is no signboard as yet so might be a challenge for those not familiar with the area. Bus service number 166, 61 and 197 goes directly. Alight after Maxwell market. Cross the road and it is a white building. Entrance by the side. \n<br />Addr : 74 Neil Road\n<br />Opening hours : 8 to 6 pm (Tues to Sun)\n<br />Closed on Mons.
