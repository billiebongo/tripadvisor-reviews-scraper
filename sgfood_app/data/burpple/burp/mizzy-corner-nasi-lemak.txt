one of the best Nasi Lemak in SG
The chicken wings here have an amazing crunchy outer layer that really completes this coconut rice dish! .\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm #changivillage #nasilemak #mizzycorner #jiaklocal #hawkercentre #chickenwing

Chicken wing was meh, too much batter for my liking. 
The rice and wings are super yumz üëçüèº
Towards the end of the Eastern spectrum, you will be transported back to the 80s Singapore-feel to Changi Village Hawker Centre. Here lies two stalls that has been churning out plates of nasi lemak to loyal supporters for many years. There are numerous debates as to which is the better stall, who has the longer queue, better location, fengshui, rice, chicken wings and the list goes on. Since young, I was an International Nasi Lemak avid fan and this will be the definitive stopover before and after an Ubin day-trippin outing. As the Ubin trips started getting lesser, the visit here eventually transformed to a supper haunt. Until recently, I have converted to a Mizzy Corner supporter for the more robust sambal chilli, fragrant coconut rice and chicken wings that made me crave for more. One thing never change though is that it just doesn\'t feel like visiting Ubin or Changi Village until I have a plate of nasi lemak.\n<br />|\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #sghawker #hawkerhopping #hawkerpedia
The ikan bilis is very crispy but the coconut rice is not fragrant enough. The sambal chili is nice. üëçüëç #sghawkerfood #burpple #8dayseatout #hawkerfoodsg #nasilemak #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #foodporn #pickyeaterssg #instafood #sgnasilemak #changivillage
