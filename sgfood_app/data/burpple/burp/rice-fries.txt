I enjoyed the bowl of soup but I thought it leaned more towards a seafood soup rather than a lobster bisque. Hence I think the dish name was a bit misleading until I read the description in details that it is a seafood bisque. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #ricenfries #seafood #bisque
More can be done to improved on this snack! Would prefer a thick consistency for the sauce (too watery) and luncheon meat should be salty not bland.\n<br />Rating : üåùüåùüåú\n<br />.\n<br />Rice &amp; Fries\n<br />484 Changi Road\n<br />Singapore 419896\n<br />Parking : Free parking outside of the cafe if you\'re lucky enough or along Changi Rd parallel parking (coupon)\n<br />.\n<br />Opening hours:\n<br />Wed - Mon : 11am to 11pm\n<br />Closed on Tuesday\n<br />#sgwanderlust #sgfood #sgeats #sgcafe #cafesg #sgmondays #spamfries #igsg #sgig #singapore #food #foodie #foodporn #foodgasm #foodsg #lunchsg #wanderlust #instadaily #instagood #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodporn #foodblogger #travel #travelgram #burpple
What I like about the luncheon meat frites is the crispy exterior while the innard still retain the moist texture, unlike most places that deep fried everything to a dry almost crispy texture. It also comes with a salt egg yolk dip that made it even more addictive.
Deep fried to crispy with juicy interior, this is a delectable starter for sharing.
The rack of ribs was cooked to a nice tender, falling off the bone with ease. The meat also comes with a hint of smokiness. I find that the sweet house special bbq sauce enhances the whole enjoyment of the dish but my dining partner feels that it is too sweet. That\'s why taste is always subjective. You can\'t satisfy everyone\'s palate.
The warm molten lava cake has a crusty surface that adds a layer of texture enjoyment amid the chocolate lava centre and moist body.
I need a bottle of the @somersbysg Apple Cider to cool me down. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #ricenfries #somersby #somersbycider
The Crab &amp; Lobster Risotto ($21.80) is probably my favourite. The risotto is cooked to an enjoyable grainy bite texture which is how I like it. The risotto is also well infused with the rich and intense lobster bisque, packed with generous serving of crab meat.
The version at Rice &amp; Fries is rich, intense and creamier, coating every stand of the pasta. On top of that, the used of curry leaves lifted the flavour, giving it an extra oomph.
Simple is, as it often is, best. #burpple
Basic? Yes. Sweet, soothing and comforting? Very much yes.
Pity about the small dessert portions though. The lava cake was tiny. For its $9.80 price tag, I felt underwhelmed.
.\n<br />When I first heard of the love story between the owner Ken Chia and his wife, I was moved by their sweet romance of how he used to cook lamb shank every day to woo his wife back in the days when he was just a trainee chef and she was a waitress working in the same restaurant.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />After a while, his wife became suspicious as everyone else in the restaurant only get to eat fried rice or fried noodles but she get to eat this specialty lamb shank! How sweet! They are now serving refreshing Somersby ciders too to accompany the wholesome food! üíïüíïüíï\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />https://misschocoholic.com/rice-and-fries-cafe-review/\n<br />Ô∏èüíô\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #foodporn #sgig #sgfood #igsg #igfood #instafood #foodstagram #foodphotography #eatoutsg #burpple #foodgasm #foodbloggers #foodpics #instasg #instafoodsg #misschocoholic #yelpsg #foodcoma #foodreviewssg #instadaily #foodporn #somersby #dessert #dessertporn #applecider #ricenfries #somersbysg #somersbycider #ighut
