Visited Lime Restaurant for our yearly festive buffet with the family. It comes with a complimentary festive drink made up of their Signature Limenade, Ginger Ale, Eggnog and Honeydew (Advisible to consume upon serving as the taste gets weird after all the ice has melted.)
This high-ceilinged area on the first floor of PARKROYAL on Pickering is bustling come meal times and we\'re not surprised! The buffet spread (lunch from $48, dinner from $65) includes a dizzying array of sugary treats that greets you at the entrance — who can resist a chocolate fountain? But before you go crazy on the sweets, first stack your plate with freshly shucked oysters, crab legs and lobsters before moving on to the Peranakan section. You can fix up your own rojak and kueh pie tee, cut through the tender babi pongteh and get your ayam buah keluak craving satisfied. Lime pre-scoops the precious buah keluak paste out of its shell and serves it on the side, allowing you to spend more time eating than scooping! End your meal on a (very) sweet note with their famous white chocolate green tea fountain (may change during festive occasions), local delights like durian pengat and yummy cake! \n<br />Avg Price: $80 per person \n<br />Photo by Burpple Candice Fox
This Christmas, stuff yourself silly with friends &amp; family over a spread of Peranakan dishes, fresh seafood, a Chinese spread booth, tons of Christmas cuts, fresh pasta, loads of desserts &amp; the highlight - GREEN TEA WHITE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN! 
Honey Glazed Gammon Ham.
Came for lunch buffet. The spread was good with smoked salmon, salmon, octopus, prawns, shells, roasted chicken and many more. Really good for lunch buffet in terms of variety and value.
We said we will arrange for dinner and it was postponed so many times because there is always someone who is not around. 2 persons can\'t make it tonight but we still met up and all we want to have are Lobsters. We had 9 different lobster dishes for a few rounds. (We wanted to eat this Lobster Fest thing when it first came out in June, then the promo ended and we still didn\'t eat it as we kept postponing our dinner. Then it came back! But only on Wednesdays and Thursdays till December. ) This is the Lobster Lux-Sa.
One of the best value high teas in Singapore serving a delectable high tea set with premium Gryphon teas. Service is great with the staff doing their rounds ensuring your cup is not empty. The sweet treats served their purpose and brought excitement to our taste buds. A great way to pamper yourself! \n<br />Check out below for in depth review\n<br />http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2016/10/food-review-lime-restaurant-tier-of-joy.html
Available now till 19 June 2016, and then every Wed and Thurs until 1 December.

2/3]\n<br />Maine Lobster with Truffled Hollandaise Sauce and Espelette 😍😍😍 but wait this is still not the best lobster dish on the buffet line! Can\'t u believe it?
Free flow lobsters!!! From 27 May to 19 June 2016, 6:30pm and 10.30pm, @parkroyalpickering will be bringing to you Lobsterfest at Lime Restaurant!!! What is there not to love??? $99 per adult includes unlimited chilled juices, soft drinks, specialty coffee and tea and a glass of Lime\'s signature Limenade. Mai tu liao!!!!
This is THE Ultimate All-You-Can-Eat LOBSTER BUFFET at Lime PARKROYAL on Pickering Hotel, Singapore @parkroyalpickering http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/05/24/limelobster/
One of the better banquet set menus, and very attentive &amp; accommodating service staff too, a marked improvement from our last event there a year ago. Take it from me, majorly picky event manager who did not have to \"scream\" at anyone this time around, a very much welcome change from my last couple of events. Definitely highly recommend this venue if you\'re looking for a function space.
And finally, the dessert that had everyone raving. Lovely presentation too.
Haha I don\'t mind actually, cos I supposed it\'s quite rare to see nation-wide celebrations in other countries😊 Here\'s a HeartSG Little Red Dot Cake--&gt; a red velvet cake but not as rich and heavy as the typical Ang Moh red velvet. \n<br />And you might have guessed, it\'s SGD50 for a 1-kg cake. Customized sizes are available and you can enjoy this all the way till September~
furthermore there is free flow beer! \n<br />featuring my favourite herbal garlic butter lobster out of all flavours. basically I have learnt a trick - to camp for their refill and whack the half-lobsters! if not majority will be lobster claws. and there is really a taste difference between both parts!
The signature of Parkroyal on Pickering\'s buffet, this gorgeous tower of fondue has attracted foodies, even if only for its instagrammability 😉 the spread made the entire trip worth it though! One of the best buffet spreads I\'ve ever eaten, with quality and quantity that impressed 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Lime serves both Southeast Asian and International cuisines, and both are superb. You might want to start off with bread rolls slathered in Echire butter (yes, that gorgeous French butter), or perhaps by fixing up your own rojak. There is a whole section dedicated to Peranakan cuisine, with items like Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Pongteh, and Itek Tim. From their Chinese Wok-fried dishes, go for the Curry Leaf Chicken. Also expect international favourites like pizza, roasts, salads and pastas. Finally, for dessert, dip your skewers of fruit / marshmallows / anything you like into their iconic matcha white chocolate fountain! Traditional desserts worth trying are the Nyonya kueh, bubur hitam and durian pengat. Buffet lunch ($48++) and dinner ($62++) served daily, save for Sundays where a more extensive brunch buffet ($98++) is served.
So satisfying! Crayfish, crabs and lobsters were served fresh (cold seafood) and piping hot. They were replenished quite fast. Besides cold seafood, they were cooked in chilli crab sauce, black pepper, barbecued and etc. 
Unlimited roasted beef, heart laksa and my personal favorite - durian pengat.
So I can only blame myself for giving in to temptation 😈 Let your desires go wild and smear your food in green blotches cos you\'ll never know when it\'s the next time you can do it again!
Now I used the time to \"play\" hehe....Arranged the triple choc ice cream, raspberry sorbet on top of cheese crackers and drizzled them with sauce from the #matcha fondue 👀 哈哈、我是不是很有艺术天分？😜🙊 #老黄卖瓜 anyway the triple choc ice cream is really superb👍
A little respite from summer🍵Watch out for the Pistachio Religieuse right at the center! Nasty little bombs that detonated pistachio cream liquid at the instant bite. The whipped cream is just a disguise! 😆 [other 小人物--&gt;lemon meringue, mango chocolate cup, chocolate tart, pistachio pain de gene]
Nope, I don\'t want to poke my marshmallow stick inside🍡🙅. I want to poke a straw in and drink it up 🍹🙆
Makan w lt,nina,gina. First meet up of the yr :)
Love this fizzy, not too sweet lime juice #workinglunch
Enjoying their spread of Peranakan food. But first... Let\'s start with dessert! 😋
Lime may not be in the hotel buffet restaurant scene as long as names such as The Line or Melt The World, but it has already seen full bookings during dinner on weekend nights, and it\'s not difficult to see why. Offering a range of appetizers, mains and desserts, Lime has almost everything covered, from western flavours, Chinese wok-fried Favourites and even a whole section catered to Pernankan cuisine. Of particular mention would be the seafood and sushi section, which is of pretty high quality with fresh seafood and ingredients, as well as the Durian Pengat for those who can\'t resist Durian desserts. Dessert counter is also rather varied; not only concentrating on cakes but also other sweets such as Creme Brûlée, Bread &amp; Butter Pudding, not forgetting that signature and even iconic Green Tea White Chocolate Fondue that\'s the first thing you get to see when you enter. With so many items available, this is why Lime is popular with its patrons, for it\'s just one price one venue for almost everything that you would fancy!
Undoubtedly my most favourite dish here. Tiny drumlets that is wok fried in \"A\" sauce and curry leaf. Love the light hint of curry amidst the spicy, tangy yet sweet sauce. Definitely the dish that lifts the tastebuds for the night!
While other dishes were ranging from above average to rather outstanding quality, the Kueh Pie Tee was disappointing. The shell may be fresh and crisp, and the chili was a great sweet-sour-spicy mix, but the filling were a tad sour and seemed a wee bit unfresh.
Probably one of the most flavourful laksa I have had; the Laksa was spicy enough and even though it may seem a bit watery, it was pretty flavourful. There seems to be no coconut milk in here though, which means that it seemed to lack a bit of depth of flavour somehow though it was still pretty outstanding.
These cakes may be petite-sized, but they are not shy on its flavour. These are heavily zingy, from its sugar glazing all the way down to the cake which is doused in lemon zest. You have been warned.
One of the cakes that wasn\'t really outstanding to me. The Green Tea Mousse has flakes of white chocolate which takes away some of its Matcha flavour along with it. The Green Tea sponge cake layer was fluffy and light, and had light hints of matcha flavour, though the I can\'t really detect the Azuki part of the cake.
Apricot mousse that is tart and sweet above the banana cake that we are all familiar with. Interesting combination indeed!
Their version of this is just custardy as it is soft and jiggly. Smother it with the Vanilla sauce by the side; sweet and luscious dessert indeed!
Coconut Milk was thick and fresh and the various condiments were soft and soaked in coconut-y goodness. Would have preferred the chewy bits to have more bite as they were a bit too soft for my liking
Thick durian mousse that\'s a bittersweet combination as it comes with Gula Melaka on the top to add on to the sweetness. There was traces of fibre, but it could do with more to make it feel more of the real deal.
Taste-wise it was pretty outstanding from the eggy custard and the burnt caramel on the top, but we missed the crackling layer on the surface when we were greeted by the liquid burnt caramel swirling in the ramekin.
From their live station. Cooked to order, the cream sauce was cooked dry but still provided a creamy taste to the pasta. Not too bad, but the pasta was a teeny bit undercooked.
Lime seems to do their sushi Maki style. The one on the left is Unagi, with Unagi on the top encasing a slice of cucumber and lightly-fried tempura bits beneath to provide a crunch. The one on the right is covered in seaweed flakes, with cheese stuffed in the middle. Rice is fresh, and mildly sweet from the vinegar. Pretty decent!
Loving the Sautéed Red Potatoes which were tasty seasoned in just simple pepper and salt and spices with skin on. The sautéed root vegetables were also pretty good as they were soft, but could be better if they were warmer
One of the items that you would be most tempted to try at LIME. It had a stronger ratio of white chocolate to green tea as the green tea wasn\'t really prominent in taste. But again it\'s hard to make a green tea fondue without the use of white chocolate so probably it is not too bad ...
Thanks to it small serving, I didn\'t felt any heaviness. Try not be eat anything light after it because all you taste will be the durian aftertaste.
But who caresssss.
However, the chicken was way overcooked and tough. (Who can blame them? Hours over the steamer)
🍡Lime\'s buffet dinner was pleasantly delightful, good range of food choices with that pretty deco &amp; ambiance. Thanks @sgcampaign for the food experience &amp; great hospitality from LIME @parkroyalpickering ☺️
Just image you can find an un-ending slices of chocolate cake!!! 😍😍😍
Food variety wasn\'t much but the service there was excellent!! Thank you for the candle. \n<br />Not forgetting @the_entertainer241 for the awesome deal too!
Matcha fondue, you\'ve been missed 😋

Their desserts could be better.
After a long while, we finally met for high tea. Just the two of us. Just like way back then.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />This high tea set meant for two pax costs $48++. Very petite pastries and savories. My favorite was the passionfruit meringue tart. Buttery shell and tangy custard made it refreshing. We also got to savor different types of teas.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />The high tea was the reason we were there. But it was more of a very personal catch up session. We had an enjoyable time photoshooting. We indulged, we had a long convo.. serious and not so serious and we laughed. Thank you @jellylovefats for the awesome afternoon. The time spent is treasured.
For $42, you get a high tea set and a single servicing of specialty coffee and TWG Tea.

Stealing the limelight is always their Green Tea Chocolate fondue, but the other dessert creations are also equally (if not more) enticing and exquisite. #fondue #dessert #hightea #buffet #sweets #lime #burpple

So pleasing to the eyes. Beautiful. We ordered the black ink pasta. It may look scary to some but it doesn\'t taste much difference as compared to the usual pasta. #sgig #igsg #sgfood, #instasg #food #foodpics #foodporn #instafood #foodies #foodgasm #foodstagram #burpple #delicious #yummy #awesome #iglikes #tripadvisor #foodblogger #sgfoodie #sgfooddiary #openrice #hungrygowhere #igfood #sgfoodies #eatoutsg @eatdreamlove #eatdreamlove #buffet http://www.eatdreamlove.com/lime-park-royal-hotel-pickering/

Nice, small spread with Peranakan selections

#desserts #brunch - Park Royal #singapore #hotel #burpple
Park Royal on Pickering Hotel, Lime International Buffet! The best thing about this place is the green tea chocolate fondue, unfortunately the machine was sent for servicing the day I visited though so we had to dip our marshmallows in a dish instead. Full video review up on my channel if you want to see what else they offer, clickable link on my profile 😊 #sgfood #sgbuffet #singapore #food #foodporn #dessert #vscocam #parkroyalpickering #limebuffet #igsg
