Matcha Red Bean + Macadamia Nut on freshly baked waffles! Loved the macadamia nut ice cream but where\'s the red bean hmmmm
A stressful week calls for a sweet treat. This cinnamon cookies ice cream really surprised me. Generous amount of bits of cinnamon cookies in a scoop, cinnamon is prominent and I can never doubt Daily Scoop for their smooth milky texture of ice creams. Top up a buck for a peanut-chocolate coated cone. 
Having lots of iced desserts and ice cream lately all thanks to the insane weather. Strawberry shortcake, avocado, rum and raisin, tiramisu really good! Having said that, there isn\'t a daily scoop flavor that has disappointed me yet.
Surprisingly coconut icecream with waffles. Love the refreshing taste of it as well as the bits of coconut pulp inside! They do have brownies as well as cones. 
One of the most memorable flavours I had here was the lychee martini ice cream. Crowded but you can always opt to eat it alfresco outside the walkways that has seats. #dessert #hollandvillage #singapore
Yay! Scoop of today, lemon sorbet with chocolate coated cone. Cool and refreshing, prefect treat for the hot day!
My dad loves it so much that he bought another round! Lol!
Thai chai, macadamia and just coffee are the 3 flavors of my pick and a waffle which sums up to be about $13+. I love the flavors that I picked so much however the macadamia was not the best I\'ve tried. The waffle was not very tasty and not crisp on the outside but the entire waffle is considered pretty soft. However I went there another time, the flavors available was almost completely different and I was quite disappointed. Tried some other flavors that day and did not like it. 
Virgin experience at daily scoop. Just good old ice cream. Nothing much to highlight though.
The Maple Crisp ice-cream is really fragrant, contains crunchy bits of nuts (I think it\'s almond) and is not too sweet. The waffle cone is also always very fresh and crisp. Yum! Go for it if you love pancakes and all foods that taste like pancakes ;) 
At just $3.50 per cone, The Daily Scoop\'s ice cream makes a sweet treat! Such a delight that they serve so many flavours, even for chocolate they have hazelnut chocolate, dark chocolate, and so many more. It makes a good treat for anyone!
Cos there\'s always room for dessert 
The Daily Scoop sells mainly ice cream but alongside with the waffles, it\'s such a treat to enjoy in the hot weather. Waffles are just awesome bread, isn\'t it? The air-conditioned place allows patrons to enjoy the cooling ice cream waffles as well. 
Best lunch this week 😋
Some lychee martini and avocado ice cream to celebrate hump day! Love their lychee martini ice cream. Though the avocado taste slightly sweet due to the gula Melaka 
All-time favourites, utterly avocado &amp; mister salted brown. So darn good! 👍
After-meal desserts with the queen! Baked waffles with hazelnut heaven and pulut hitam ice cream scoop!
Salted mister brown sitting on a warm brownie. Need to watch that expanding waistline.
I think I might have found a new favourite flavour at The Daily Scoop, Extra Stout! Love it so much! :)
The kookie monster was nice! But the lemon sorbet was not as good as expected. Price was ok ~$3 per scoop
Part 2 of my last day before turning vegan. Hazelnut &amp; chocolate ice cream. Not satisfied, not at all. With the taste, the standard, the service, pretty much everything.
Super awesome with the hot and cold experience from the brownie and ice cream. 
Burpple\'s EDM recommendation brought me here. Didn\'t expect it to be so crowded!!
Salted caramel and avocado ice cream. De-stress time after work.

Yes! now #dailyscoop sever yummy #crepes too! Tired mushroom &amp; cheese was very yum, less than 5mins went into to me &amp; @monninium tumtum. Still missing the cheddar cheese taste from crepe. Love their hot chocolate too. But check out the difference in between 2 cups. Time to #QC 😂 #durian #icecream #hotchocolate #cafesg #foodsg #burpple
