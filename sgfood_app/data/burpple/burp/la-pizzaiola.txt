Located in a row of shophouses in Braddell Heights estate, La Pizzaiola serves up wholesome, authentic Italian fare. Here, the homey ambience is perfect for enjoying a romantic evening of great food, without burning a hole in your wallet. Their 12\" pizzas go for $14-17, pastas for $13-15, and house wine for just $8 a glass! Go for the Parma &amp; Rucola Pizza ($16.90), and choose your own pasta and sauce combination.
Chocolate lava cake. Mmm yummy.
Cannelloni with spinach and ricotta cheese.
Soft meat, but gets a bit repetitive after a few bites.
Pizza with a spicy kick.
I\'ll say this again, you\'ll never get to taste such authentic Italian pasta at $12.90. Perfect for a casual weeknight when you want to have something good and convenient.
Still one of the best value for money, authentic Italian pastas you can find in singapore.
Yum! Cheap and good!
Squid ink pasta, 9/10. Generous portions of squid, well balanced, very worth the $20/++ for this special.
This is called the Rucola Parma pizza. Filled with tomato, mozzarella, rockets and LOTS OF PARMA HAM!!! Reasonably priced too. All pizzas here are made in a brick oven.

Great to be back! #burpple
The pizza was fabulous. Spaghetti di fruitti de mare. 
Simple yet delicious! Torta pistocchi. 
Authentic Italian pizza. Freshly made dough. 
My favourite ingredients in this were the juicy mushrooms and light mozzarella! Large enough serving to share among 2, and you can leave some space in your stomach for dessert at wimbly lu next door.  üòè Calzone at $17.90 
Hot &amp; crispy , yummy!
Couldn\'t remember the exact name. But it\'s whole meal pasta with melted cheese and potato baked with dough on it. A really unique way of making pasta. Definitely a wow factor 
Very delicious Saffron Risotto Lamb Shank concocted specially by the chef for us this evening at #laPizzaiola #food #love #dining
Spicy salami pizza. Love the light crust and the right blend of mozzarella cheese. Love this place!

Squid ink potato dumpling with crab meat sauce. #verygood #dinner #foodporn #instadaily
Awesome for coco lovers!
warm and cosy taste
BEST dark chocolate cake I\'d ever have!!
Not good 
Honestly speaking, one of the best panna cottas I\'ve ever had. Generous amount of vanilla beans and love the butterscotch sauce over it. A MUST TRY here.
