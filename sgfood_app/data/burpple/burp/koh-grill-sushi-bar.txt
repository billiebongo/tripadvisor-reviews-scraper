Aburi Chirashi ($17.90)
Wisma: One of my fav maki sushi\'s around! Everything i love in a roll 😍 My afternoon snack &amp; always 1 plate for me! It\'s super jelat though, so if you wanna order other stuff, recommend to share instead. Have eaten this for years &amp; for the 1st time today, it was \"off\" 😔 Something was amiss with the sauce, no smokiness. Unagi was fridge-cold &amp; with bones. These were new for me, hopefully just one-off issues.\n<br />🍣\n<br />Rating: 7/10\n<br />🍣\n<br />Will i return/recommend: Yes/Yes\n<br />🍣\n<br />Pros: It\'s really shiok when done right! Love the pitan tofu too! Aburi &amp; foie gras sushi\'s quite good.\n<br />🍣\n<br />Cons: Long q during peak hrs. Oily, cramped, squeezy place. Most food 👎 especially cooked dishes like fried rice/udon etc... Foie gras maki roll is a joke. Mediocre sashimi. Won\'t patronize here for Jap food - only the shiok maki.\n<br />🍣\n<br />Price: S$18 - shiok maki gen.1
If you\'ve tried the popular Shiok Maki, this is essentially the Shiok Maki ($16.80) in one mouth! It\'s packed with that familiar smoky and savoury sweet cheesy flavour along with a piece of melt in your mouth torched salmon and crunchy ebiko on the top. So shiok it will leave you hanging for more, and for this price, just go straight for the Shiok Maki!
Decided to go with the Crappy Maki instead of the usual Shiok Maki to try and it came with soft shell crab maki wrapped with seared swordfish belly and a drizzle of a slightly spicy sweet sauce. Really liked the textures in here - crunch from the crab and tobiko along with the smooth tender belly, but I was really missing the thick layer of smoky sauce that comes with the shiok maki. I’ve got to say though, the absence of the sauce also means that you can really get a good taste of the different elements. Not crappy at all although it was pricey. Also, this place still has never ending queues, go during the non peak hours to beat the crowd!
Have been craving for Pitan (century egg) Tofu since FOREVER and finally got down to Koh Grill for it. Served chilled, the smooth tofu paired with their home made pitan paste, chopped up century eggs, crunchy ebiko and spring onions makes it the perfect appetizer! The thick creamy pitan sauce wasn\'t too intense, but strong enough to satisfy my cravings. Loved the play of textures all in one bite!
The \"shiok\" maki is an apt name indeed; each maki slice is perfectly saturated with mentaiko sauce and topped generously with just the right amount of roe. Somehow, despite the deliciously sloppy and wet coating, the insides remain crisp and provide a satisfying crunch that contributes greatly to the shiok factor! 
Shiok Maki Gen 1, $16.80.\n<br />Salmon salad, $10.
Once your teeth sink into a piece, your mouth explodes in a savoury melting chemistry of torched cheesy mayo and seared salmon, with sweet and umami unagi. It\'s such a big mouthful you have to keep your mouth shut and chewing until it\'s all down the throat. As you do, the flavours fight to overpower each other but keep fusing instead, until you peak. Rather than struggling to appreciate the individual flavours, appreciate it for its mess of flavours. A rojak roll of Japanese it is. Lingering smokiness gradually departs as you come down from the climax. Thus, your mouth is ready to close around the next big mouthful. That is the Shiok Maki ($16.80). http://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/2017/02/12/Koh-Grill-Sushi-Bar
Craving sushi with fresh, grainy wasabi! Sake ($2.80 for 2pc) with slices of raw salmon, chunky and long, the boy took me to try his favourite 👦🏽 On a side note, with the Sake Kawa Maki ($2.80 for 6pc), its shards of deep fried salmon skin were much like anchovies fried so crunchy dry they tickle your throat. I needed tea for that 😂\n<br />.\n<br />http://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/2017/02/12/Koh-Grill-Sushi-Bar
The other makis arent as good as this one. Loving the sauce and the salmon and everything else that was wrapped inside! A must get over here! Didnt feel rly heavy for me, but its better to share among with your friends!
Chicken, veggies, eggs and noodles! Loving this dish, its a must order at koh grill! I couldnt stop at one bite. 
Shiok Maki 1st Gen, $16.80!
ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI PLACES IN TOWN NEED I SAY MORE
If you know me, you will know I love noodles! This one wasn\'t bad. 😻🍴

Just discovered this shiok maki! 😍😍 this one is charcoal grilled eel wrapped with lightly roasted salmon. Abundance of fish roe on top and look at that thick mayonnaise. Very satisfying and delicious! 😍🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍴

Managed to just snap what I came here for! Second gen shiok maki - shiok indeed!
This place is known for their epic \"Shiok Maki\" which features a salmon-aburi-wrapped-unagi-maki drowning in sauce and roe. But maybe try something different like this Agadashi Tofu dish with a twist for $8. Also drowned in the same sauce and topped with fried fish skins... what\'s not to love about it?
Crispy prawn wrapped in sushi rice and salmon. The entire roll is then flooded with their special mayo sauce that is torched. Lastly a generous portion of fish roe to sum up the shiokness in the entire dish. I feel so good just eating this.
Both dishes were delicious, we had their fried rice as well. Recommend as one of the best sushi in Singapore 
3 slices of aburi salmon &amp; 4 slices of something white(probably sword fish or smth, im not sure, might be 2 of 2 different fish), topped with tobiko. 
As Japan Food Town @ Wisma is officially opening this week, Koh Grill came up with new menu items to fend off its competitors. 
One plate will cost you $16. Though is abit expensive,  but it is totally worth the price. This is a must to try \n<br />Rating: 5/5
One of the best yaki udon i ever tasted \n<br />Rating: 5/5
Sometimes, the salmon is thick, you can taste the avocado &amp; unagi within &amp; there are appropriate amount of sauce which make this maki really awesome. Other times, the salmon is very thin with small piece of avocado &amp; unagi which u can taste &amp; overflowing sauce that makes you wonder if you are just buying the sauce. But, I really enjoy the shiokmaki when I get the former one. 
Sushi rice wrapped over grilled unagi and topped with torched salmon before being drowned in that special mayo based sauce and topped with tobiko. Massive explosions of flavour with every bite. Sushi purists might lament the loss of the individualistic flavours but... Ugh it\'s so shiok I don\'t seem to mind. 🙈 (7.9/10)
I\'m a simple man, I see Tofu with Century Egg - I order. 😉\n<br />No regrets, was the best thing we had here and we almost ordered a second portion! Great umami bursts to kickstart your appetite as you dive into the heavier Maki Rolls. 
This was introduce from my colleague ,and I ask her how does the shiok maki taste like ,she reply in one words \"SHIOK\",if u ask me I will give u the same answer too :)there are two gen of shiok maki ,we order the first gen  ,is good to share with friend as u will get jelat easily Bc there is generous of layer of mayonnaise on each piece of sushi,we also ordering the other stand alone sushi called \"SHIOK!\"，$6.00/piece ,this one is consider exp but so damn good ,quality food with quality price ,u can taste the salmon melted in you mouth,heavenly good 👍🏻be prepare that usually long Q during dinner time ,is worth to Q !get your shiok maki now !Overall rating :4/5 .
A bit late to the party, my first time having Koh\'s SHIOK Maki! \n<br />An abundance of tobiko and cheesy mayo, it\'s quite hard to go wrong with a mix of such decadent flavors even though I could hardly taste the ebi fry in the center. \n<br />The best way to eat this seems to be stuffing a whole piece in your mouth to avoid any wayward collapses of Maki integrity. 
SHIOK AH! (ver. 2) bathing in the thick pool of cheesy mayo lies seared slices of salmon wrapping around rolls of ebi tempura(ver.2)/ seared unagi (ver.1 - background), with a generous serving of ebiko roe. Many renditions of SHIOK maki have been popping up all over sg, but the original is still the best. Having said that, i still prefer the ver.1 of SHIOK! maki 😆 please don\'t hate me @colinnlee #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #SHIOK #burpple
Missing the Shiok Maki from Koh Grill &amp; Sushi Bar with my bff 😋💖 also missing the bff.
My personal opinion: I don\'t think it lives up to its name. Definitely not something I will wait long in queue for at their price range. I have definitely taste much better maki elsewhere, and definitely also better sushi... #averagerating #sushimaki #burple
I had the 2nd generation version, with fried prawns instead of grilled unagi. The soft salmon sashimi and their special blend of mayo with a \'smoky\' fragrance remains unchanged though. 🤗 (8 for $16.80, previously reviewed)
Starting from $11.90, it\'s definitely a more affordable option compared to the popular, often raved-about Shiok Maki ($16.80)! (Can\'t say it\'s overrated though — it lives up to my sky-high expectations) \n<br />The Yaki Udon ($10) makes for an interesting spin from the usual tempera udon, with fried egg and vegetables peppering the dish.
One of the best sushi I\'ve ever had! It was so shiok! Literally lived up to its name hahahaha 👍🏻 But it gets a but too \"gelat\" after eating too much. But definitely a good sushi to have every now &amp; then! 
Pro: Generous portion of fish roe and cheese! Very rich in taste - Cheesy and overwhelming. One serving is good for sharing, but jer lat to finish one person! 😬 Con: Rich flavour overpower the tastes of the salmon and vinegar rice. One will not be able to taste the freshness of the fish. 
Been wanting to try the aesthetically pleasing Shiok Maki ($16.80). Just looking at it kicks up my appetite. There are 2 Gens of Shiok Maki. We\'ve ordered the Gen 1 because I love unagi 😍. A little heavy due to the amount of mayonaise. Overall verdict: Shiok! 😋
I might be late to the shiok maki party, but at least I finally got to find out how shiok exactly this maki is. It was definitely shiok, maybe even a bit too shiok as it got increasingly jelat with the generous layer of mayonnaise slathered on each piece. Good for sharing with friends like we did today, and I\'m glad we did cause I probably wouldn\'t be able to get past the 3rd piece alone.#Burpple

It is very shiok indeed but somehow I find it hard to finish this on my own. I do get sick of this after the fourth piece. Tried their seafood fried rice and I totally recommend it!
The last time I was here for the shiok maki and bento sets was two years ago! It wasn\'t as popular then but it was known as the hidden gen anyway. Glad to know that the price increase isn\'t matched with a drop in quality and taste! 
Sushi roll ladled with a generous serving of  cheesy creamy delicious sauce and topped off with tiny briney roe that bursts in your mouth with every bite you take
Of course, you HAVE to order the shiok maki when you\'re there. Will never get sick of it! It is very shiok indeed, with a perfect combination of unagi (omg unagi!!! can you sense my excitement already), a thin layer of rice, a thick slice of salmon, fish roe, and mayo. Their mayo was the winner for me, I have not tasted anything like this before and I wonder what kind of secret recipe they used! However, I would recommend sharing it with another person, because the creaminess can get quite jelat after a while. Ordered the Crappy Maki to share as well. Personally, I prefer the Crappy Maki - the crispy soft shell crab and crunchy seaweed provided a different texture to the swordfish belly and the rice, and there is a slight tinge of spice which isn\'t overpowering at all, but just stimulates your tastebuds. It\'s a very nice combination indeed! Will definitely return again someday.
Crispy soft-shell crab and spicy sauce sushi topped with smoky slices of torched yellowtail and an inch-high plateau of tobiko. Love this as much as the iconic Shiok Maki rolls!
Yes yes, I know Koh Grill is famous for their Shiok Maki (Gen. 1 and 2). But looking at how the Shiok Makis are being prepared now, I\'d rather order other makis. 
I can\'t go on a day without meat. To start off my day of shopping, I need my energy food - BEEF! For $12, I found the beef fillet reasonably tasty. Slightly on the chewy side but retaining the juicy and little red of the beef. Not bad, which explains why we ordered 2 plates. 😆
Salmon belly, swordfish belly, white tuna, hamachi and ama ebi. Thick cuts of the succulent sashimi are so satisfying but I was a little disappointed as it was not as fresh as it used to be. (My previous visit was more than a year ago.) Though Koh Grill still serves the generous cuts, the sweetness and shiok-ness are lesser than before. 😢
The maki in focus is the Shiok Maki Generation 2 (with fried tempura prawn) while the one behind is the Shiok Maki Generation 1 (with grilled unagi). Both are priced at $16.80++ for 8 pieces of maki.
Indeed the word shiok came to my mind as I gobbled this down. Rest of the food was so so only and not really worth the hype. #burpple #whati8today #sgfoodies #dietstartstomorrow
The shiok have left the building. Honestly, I felt a tad disappointed in this plate of supposedly fantastic maki. Somehow, it felt like it is pre-made , left in the cold waiting for someone to pick it up. In which, sadly it was me. Urgh
Honestly the best dish I had at Koh Grill and Sushi Bar. Cheap, delicious and flavourful. The nice thick century egg sauce goes oh-so-well with the cold tofu. It is topped with the tobiko roe and spring onions, to give that extra crunch to the otherwise soft dish. Pretty much, yes I am sold. 
SHIOK! 1st gen shiok maki is always my fav and it literally melts in your mouth hehehe 😍😋
Apart from the Shiok Maki, the Aburi Salmon Sushi and Salmon Sushi are so fresh and yummy. Rating: 5 / 5
What better way to kickstart the weekend than with the shiokness of the signature shiok maki here? Pure goodness of unagi embedded in the rice, and wrapped with succulent salmon, topped with yummy sauce! Worth many revisits!\n
The spiciness was barely there, wished the sauce had more spiciness because of what the name suggests. Asparagus and tempura bits are what I personally like, and they added texture to it which is nice. However there seems to be the element of dried bonito flakes in it which can be dampening. Overall the taste was quite a miss for me but I think its a good try, especially for those who is afraid to consume raw tuna.

Heavenly combination of charcoal grilled eel wrapped with lightly roasted salmon 》$16.80
Japanese styled fried noodle with chicken egg &amp; vegetable 》$10
Chilled tofu served with homemade paste 》$4
There are 2 variations and this is the 2nd generation (S$16.80). It has crispy prawn wrapped with lightly toasted salmon and drenched with mentai and tobiko. \n<br />I really love this combination, and it\'s flavourful for me. But the only gripe is that the prawns are cold. I think it would have been much better when it\'s being served hot!
Crispy prawn wrapped w roasted salmon, topped w a ton of roe. To make it even more enticing, it is drenched w a combination of mentai and tobiko sauce. Contrary to first impressions upon looking at the image on the menu, the sauce wasn\'t too heavy. It complements and doesn\'t overpower the sushi itself.

Miso itself fuses nicely w the soup (not the kind where the miso sinks to the bottom and you have to stir it after some time). Cabbage was really sweet, clams fresh and tender. Having all the elements in one mouthful makes it really yummy and comforting. $5 for such quality soup is definitely a steal. Must try and must have!

This is really shiok, no wonder it is called shiok maki gen 2! SHIOK KA!!!! 😁 #lamedescription
You can make reservations by SMS if dining during peak hours.
I LOVE IT. It\'s so good that I totally forgot the promise I made to self to only eat one. It\'s super worth my add on calories. Whatever, exercise can always start later. First generation Shiok Maki is better than second if you\'re looking for something that melts right in your mouth. Second gen is pretty good too for someone (ME) who loves prawn. 
This is located at Wisma Level 4, next to Food Republic. It is one of the best affordable sushi bar you can find in Orchard! We went during post lunch period around 4.30pm. There was no crowd and we did not have to wait. Sadly Out of 3 sections, 2 sections were closed and customers have to share table. Probably the only thing I did not like. Shiok Maki is a must try here. There is 2 types - 1st Gen is with Eel and 2nd Gen is with deep fried ebi! Love the 2nd Gen Maki, the sauce is so savory which enhances the taste of the maki! Yummilious! Not being a fan of century egg I still randomly ordered the Pitan Tofu. The taste is not too century eggy (some may be like me hating the yolk taste, it\'s less of this taste) and it\'s acceptable for me. We order the premium sashimi set. 5 types of sashimi and loves the salmon belly. All in all, we spent abt $80 for 2 pax. Worth the try!
We used to love this little Japanese food stall in food republic since years ago when it\'s called Hamoru. We like the shiok maki. Haven\'t been there much for a long time and decided to bring my baby there for a quick lunch. Can\'t finish a shiok maki on my own, I ordered this salmon sashimi with rice. The salmon was fine but the rice wasn\'t good. Too sticky and it didn\'t feel like they used Japanese short grain rice too. Standard deteriorated.
As always, it\'s delicious to satisfy cravings. The mayo sauce just perfect the sushi
One mouthful of them, you could feel some exploding chemistry happening in your mouth. You get stunned but also frightened to eat subsequently cos the taste is quite jelat! But definitely a good try although service could be better 😕 #kohgrillandsushibar #japanesefood #shiokmaki
The mayo sauce was on point and so was the lightly toasted salmon. The glorious Shiok 2nd Gen Maki topped with a generous amount of salmon roe was just melt-in-the-mouth good and I can\'t wait to go back again for more!!!
There is no clear winner between Shiok Maki and Shiok Maki 2nd Gen ($16.80), the latter which has crispy prawn wrapped with lightly toasted salmon. It\'s like the relationship in The Karate Kid between Mr Miyagi and Daniel-San, whereby both are excellent in their own aspect. When in doubt, just order both maki rolls and you can have the best of both worlds. The overly indulgence from the salmon roe and melt-in-your-mouth salmon will kickstart you into sushi heaven.
Needs no further introduction, this is a maki roll that is easily recognizable. Since 18 June is International Sushi Day, let\'s celebrate by having some Shiok Maki ($16.80). The glorious charcoal grilled eel wrapped with lightly toasted salmon before toppling it off with some kewpie mayonnaise and a spread of salmon roe. This is a heart stopping moment as every bite literally melts in your mouth.
Haven\'t had this #ShiokMaki for really long - didn\'t exactly fancy it so much the first time - &amp; now I\'m back and sorta loving it. Glad they cut down on the mentaiko sauce since then so at least I still can taste my unagi and salmon! &amp; hi this is my first post with my iPhone 6+ 😊 #burpple #8dayseat #instafoodsg #eatoutsg
If love is what causes a person to change, then I must be in love.
The grilled skewers, garlic fried rice, salmon belly soup and THE Shiok Maki is fantastic! The sushi is really fresh and the quality is so much better than regular sushi bars. A little on the pricier side but sharing is always an option! 
Shiok Maki on a Sunday with no work to dread the next day makes Sunday doubly shiok. I love this sauce so much and am unashamed to say that I scraped the plate clean.
Drop the bentos. Get this. And a shiok maki. Ur life will be complete.
$16.80 for a plate of deliciously awesome irresistible mouth-watering jaw dropping heart stopping goodness! Melts in your mouth and makes you close your eyes, clench your fist and hoist it high up in the air as you silently scream in pleasure, \"Ohhhh yesssssssss!!\"
It was almost like a production line at the sushi counter churning these maki babies!! Did they compromise on the quality though? The sushi rice was rather clampy. The 2nd gen shiok maki with ebi tempura had a very dry and still prawn wrapped within. Only good thing was that sinful torched cheesy mayo sauce haha. 
No need to think twice about ordering this! Fresh &amp; thick slices of salmon always works for me ☝️
Rather disappointing. I find the pork cutlet is slightly hard to bite, and the batter too crispy. The egg was generally dry and the onions were just not caramelised (or maybe cause they were not supposed to but oh wells). The rice was too soft and clumpy unlike the typical perfect Japanese rice that I love. I rather pay more to get a better bowl of Katsu Don somewhere else…
My first time trying the much-talked-about shiok maki at Koh\'s Grill &amp; Sushi Bar. Well, that\'s a generous amount of mentaiko and the portion is definitely satisfying. Sadly, I\'m not a big fan of mayonnaise and this sushi is covered with thick Japanese mayonnaise that tastes slightly cheese-y (or maybe they really put cheese inside :/) It\'s a good dish, and I can understand why many love it (which partly because of the price). Maybe I was just too hungry to even taste the good side of it after waiting for nearly 40 minutes.
Despite reading a lot of reviews about Koh Grill &amp; Sushi Bar and it\'s conveniently located in Orchard, it was only recently that I tried it out. What have I been missing out all these while! Prices are very affordable for the food, we ordered 2 maki rolls, salmon, salmon belly, and scallop sashimi with total damage of $60+. The sashimi were generously thick and fresh, especially love the scallop sashimi. Do try the highly raved Shiok Maki, it was definitely highlight of our meal! 
After hearing so much about this epic maki, I finally got to try it today. Grab one of the counter seats and watch how the glistening slabs of salmon are cut into slices. The very same slices sit atop the pre-rolled grilled eel and avocado maki, before the whole creation is doused with a mildly cheesy mayonnaise sauce. The chef then uses a blowtorch for the final sear-flaming touches (oh, that heavenly, smoky smell is enough to make my mouth water) before adding a generous heaping of burst-in-your-mouth tobiko (flying fish roe). Every bite is like a party in the mouth!
Shiok Maki is one of the most mouth-watering, delicious sushi in Singapore. Its grilled eel core, wrapped with rice and roasted salmon, tastes heavenly coupled with a cheesy mayonnaise layer. Service is not always satisfactory, but the melting of shiok maki in your mouth makes up for it. 
How I wish to have this now 😩😩😩 This shiok maki hit all the right spots for me, it is creamy and savory and yet not too much to the point that you felt sick. It is an added bonus that I am a fan of salmon as well! Totally the ultimate comfort food 
Shiok Maki Gen 2 $16.80+\n<br />The main difference between Gen 2 and the original Shiok Maki is the prawn. Both sushi are wrapped in slightly char grilled salmon. The eel is slightly sweeter and hence, it is usually the more popular choice.\n
Seafood Chaahan (Fried Rice) $10+\n<br />The \"wok-hei\" in this dish was overwhelming. I could smell this dish, before the waitress even served it to us. There were 5 big fresh prawns served in this dish, and the fried rice tasted heavily of garlic. So beware if you are planning to meet your date after this meal.
We hear the pitan (century egg) sauce is to die for, and the serving is so generous that you have enough to eat with the tofu and still some leftover to enjoy on its own! Photo by Burppler Yeung Kai Ho #Burpple
The portions are generous and each piece is quite a big mouthful (in a good way). The sauce is really one of a kind - slightly cheesy, tart, yet sweet. The salmon is fresh and the whole dish comes together really well. It is topped off with a large heaping of fish roe that gives it texture. It\'s no wonder people always order this dish when they come to Koh. Must try! 
Hearing endless good reviews of the Shiok Maki, finally i got the chance to tried it out today. Nevertheless the taste of Shiok Maki lives up to its well know reputation plus the attractive display that make it picturesque.
One of the favourites at Koh\'s. The century egg sauce is sinfully rich and creamy. A generous amount of sauce is given which is great considering the sushi chunks are huge. The ingredients are fresh and I particularly love that they give so much roe which really gives the dish an extra crunch. Personally I would prefer this over the shiok maki because I just lie century egg. Definitely must order when eating at Koh\'s! 
You will love this dish if you love century egg. The sauce is thick and creamy, and full of century egg flavour. The tofu and sauce come together really well, and the roe on the top gives it a nice crunch. Extremely delicious and one of the highlights at Koh Grill &amp; Sushi Bar!
Much raved about shiok maki - guess I don\'t have to say much besides.... yums!! 😻
Not sure why i like and always order this simple dish at koh\'s. Love the scrambled eggs like texture of the egg fried with udon.
Really spicy but some is even out by the cucumber.
Finally trying gen 2, cause I\'m always attracted to the unagi is gen 1 😂 however, i still like gen 1!
Definitely lives up to its name. Dont think you can find the same anywhere. Other than the shiok maki and grills that is good, the rest is meh. 
For me, the must-order dish at Koh\'s is not the famous Shiok Maki, but this thinly-sliced pork belly cooked in a yummy blend of ginger and miso paste, plus generous strips of carrots and onions that add sweetness and crunch. So good!
Their more special maki
Guess this must go into the list too
Start with an appetizer such as soup along with small side dishes(salmon skin etc).The main menu,Shiok Maki,shall be shared to avoid the overshiokness
Shiok Maki at Koh Grill &amp; Sushi Bar. Salmon + Unagi = perfect combination
I don\'t know how many photos I have of this sushi. But it is definitely still as shiok. Love the smell and taste of the seared mayo. Biting into the unagi and salmon with little roes exploding in your mouth. Yum
Though not as shiok as seared mayo, I love the taste of furukake on the exterior. As for the soft shell crab, though I don\'t taste much crab, got to love the crunchiness. 😋
It\'s been awhile since i had the shiok maki here, and it is still so good!! Simply melts in your mouth and it is just an incredible feeling.
Was somewhat apprehensive initially - eel, seared salmon, flying fish roe and avocado are ingredients I enjoy separately, but putting them together with a cheesy mayonnaise mix didn\'t seem like it would work. I was wrong. Would come again!
Might be tofu but totally not healthy but it\'s good!
Just my favouritest sushi in Singapore ^^

Shiok Maki v1 | The name does not lie. Watching how this maki was prepared was just as satisfying as eating it. Salmon aburi and a signature sauce with generous amounts of roe - the result is a melt-in-your-mouth maki that is enough to have you convinced you\'re in sushi heaven
Heavenly combination of charcoal grilled unagi, avocado wrapped with lightly roasted salmon, drenched with the most amazing cheesy sauce that is seemingly a legit mixture of mayo and mentai, and completed with a generous topping of tobiko.
Mention \"Koh Grill &amp; Sushi Bar\" and their Shiok Maki will be brought up, no question. Be prepared to queue during peak hours at this sushi place next to the food court of Wisma. Doused with cheese sauce and topped off with tobiko, their Shiok Maki is so popular that there is even a Shiok Maki 2nd Generation. Their Pidan Maki and Crabby Maki are popular as well.
Udon ain\'t my favorite noodle, but this is an exception 
Super shiokkkkk good for sharing (cause 5 people whipped everything out within 2 min)
Yaki Udon, Udon Soup, Codfish, Foie Gras Sushi. All so yummy yet affordable. Not the highlight of the restaurant but still taste awesome and shiok. 
Finally got to get this on my tastebuds after queuing for 1 full hour (no exaggeration) excluding the waiting time after ordering. Glad that it didn\'t disappoint me! The sauce was the killer it really makes you addicted to the dish. We even cleaned the plate of all the sauce after the sushi was finished! 
I\'ve been here a couple of times but never done a post about it anywhere on social media... Because I guess this is pretty well-known and kinda over-exposed in a way hahaha. Which is why I really like this app because time doesn\'t matter, it\'s really all about the food and the experience of the food and I feel like I can do a post about food at whatever time I want - whenever I think about food. That said, Shiok Maki never fails. It\'s that smokiness of the torched mayonnaise that fills your whole mouth (read: must eat whole slice at one go) and makes you go mmmfff~ gosh writing about it gives me a huugge craving for this dish... Maybe that\'s what I\'ve been trying to avoid all this while!!
The sushi melts in your mouth together with hot cheese...yummzz!
Not sure how this should taste like... but seems okay....not my favourite though...
You can taste the grill and this is so juicy! Our favourite!
Every piece is a very big piece of fresh, sweet and juicy sashimi!
Shiok maki is famous for their cheesy topping, and the combination of salmon and unagi (eel).
Fried prawn rolled in rice, crowned with half-grilled salmon, and cloaked in a staggering amount of blow-torched Kewpie. Om nom nom. 
Not a particular fan of century egg, but I CAN-NOT resist it when it\'s made into a thick sauce and coating tofu like such. 
No matter how it was cooked, I simply love the thick and chewy noodle. \n<br />Most customers visit them for the Shiok Maki but I want to introduce their yaki udon. It was very simple and nice. The fried egg and the sweet sauce made it very easy to eat. The heat from the udon made Katsuobushi seem it came back to life, moving and waving on top of the udon. However, the udon was overcook and cause it to lose the chewy texture. If they add lesser sauce, and udon will be much drier and a layer of char-ness to the dish! \n<br />#04-21, Wisma Atria Shopping Centre, 435 Orchard Road\n<br />Phone: 91803805 \n<br />Daily: 11:30 - 22:30
It was much chewier than Shiok Maki. Much lighter in taste and texture. \n<br />I was very surprised to see only one sushi chef working during such a busy night. The floor crews could not handle the busy night. They accidentally gave our seats to other customers. Slow to take orders. Slow in service. \n<br />Honestly, their sushi tasted good but not great. Thanks to their unique sauce and affordable pricing. They made this place so popular. \n<br />#04-21, Wisma Atria Shopping Centre, 435 Orchard Road\n<br />Phone: 91803805 \n<br />Daily: 11:30 - 22:30
My friend told me to be there by 5pm. My immediate reaction was \"where got people eat dinner so early?\" But when I was there, I understood why. The queue started forming at around 530pm. \n<br />Unagi and avocado wrapped with grilled salmon and topped with fish roe and clothed with a layer of cheesy sauce. \n<br />It tasted very good. Easy to eat for the first two bites. But not so Shiok after the two bites. All the ingredients were so heavy and creamy. \n<br />#04-21, Wisma Atria Shopping Centre, 435 Orchard Road\n<br />Phone: 91803805 \n<br />Daily: 11:30 - 22:30
Yummy, mouth watering, perfectly pan seared tuna with rice! The tuna has a seared layer on the outside, covering the goodness within.
Salmon and avocado maki with century egg sauce drizzled over it.. Yum. You\'ve got to try it to know.. $16.80 serves 2-3.
Shiok maki! (Crappy maki is rly rly still nicer) #burpple
Delish Delish Delish! Love how the crab roe, mango mayo, eel and salmon make such a wonderful combination. Simply divine
Not one, not two but three shiok makis! But they\'re not so shiok as before though. Or is it just me?
You heard all the rave about their Shiok Maki too? Well I\'ve been hearing lots so just gotta try it. Shiok Maki (16.8) it\'s a grilled sushi roll top with generous mentaiko cheese and tobiko. The slightly burned mentaiko sauce goes perfectly well with the Aburi Salmon on the top and the Avocado and Eel within. The texture is really creamy and creates the melting sensation when you ate with the roll. You can see everyone around just wipe off the sauce on the plate! Just like eating a good curry and rice. Yaki Udon (8) the first taste reminds me of takoyaki! We enjoyed this dish a lot because we like how the egg was done with the sauce! It\'s not too watery or starchy, the sauce makes the tangy udon smooth and you can just slurpz and slurpz! But you don\'t want to miss the sauce so you scoop and try to stick them more to your udon. Then it\'s gone! I\'m not a udon person but this is Umai! This place is worth trying if you have cravings for Japanese food and need a quick fix. Given the location it\'s definitely not for fine dining or gatherings. Cheers :)
heavenly combination of charcoal grilled eel wrapped with lightly roasted salmon
delicate white flesh of black cod fish with assortment of vegetables simmered in clear soup
Gen 2 Shiok Maki. Instead of Unagi, it\'s replaced with Prawns. Still deserve a thumbs up for its divine taste. Definitely worth the 30 mins queue! \n<br />#Japanese #Shiokmaki #Instafood #Dinner #Sgfood
Tempura shrimp reverse maki sushi wrapped with salmon sashimi, drenched in mango mayo, snowed under an avalanche of tobiko (flying fish roe)...gimickish but satisfying 😋
Everyone agreed crappy was nicer than shiok maki, and had bento E as usual, definitely more worth it than the others.
Prefer the 1st generation Shiok Maki with unagi, but overall the sauce is overpowered by mayonnaise which I feel is a tad too oily for my liking. Service wasn\'t satisfactory, maybe because we aren\'t paying for service charge. Our dessert was served before we were done with our main course because they were apparently closing and it\'s inconvenient to keep the matcha ice cream in the fridge. One of the staff knocked my friend\'s bag over and all she could do was to tell my friend that her bag has fallen to the ground 
Because there\'s first there gotta be a second, our Shiok Maki 2nd Gen (Crispy prawn and salmon). 
It only took us 20 minutes to get our 1st Gen Shiok Maki (Grilled Unagi + Salmon) 
Celebrate last day of November and still my birthday month. Shiok dinner with my two favorite girls.
Only the best sushi in singapore ;) | ★★★★★
That was more than enough tobiko to drown us in happiness! Awesome Sunday spent with @honeykick!
The queue wasn\'t that bad for a weekend night and both of us tried the Pitan Maki for the first time! Yummy! #achievementunlocked
Shiok Maki... The name of the dish is so apt - Shiokness in a mouthful!
If it\'s worth the wait it\'s gotta be good isn\'t it? Shiok Maki must be shiok-tasting! \n<br />Happy Lunching friends! \n<br />Photo by @jaycedotz \n<br />Keep tagging your food reviews to #FoodReviewsSg and #FoodReviewsAsia to share all those good food that\'s worth to queue for!
Loveeee the sushi there. The salmon was quite good. And for the texture, it\'s  not too thin. You can really taste the salmon. 
$15.90, one of the most worth bento imo. Cha soba yummy as usual, two nigiri sushi, awesome maki and tempura.
$4. Really dislike pitan but I had to try this. The texture and taste was surprisingly good.
The combination of avocado, unagi eel, ebiko and seaweed blends really well. Love love love, Shiok indeed!
Shiok maki 1st generation -- finally our turn to try it! #shiokmaki #sushi #burpple
Just like its name suggests, this is truly shiok to devour. The fish roe complements everything together so well and brings out its flavour.
Everyone\'s been raving about this so I had to try it! Honestly it\'s a bit too rich for me. I couldn\'t eat more than 2 at a go. But this is definitely worth a try! And should be shared
finally finally i gotta try this... its so yummy. really \'shiok\' maki
a favourite dish and worth ordering again every single time I\'m back! 
Generous tobiko atop charcoal grilled eel wrapped with salmon maki. Drizzle a creamy cheese sauce and that gives you the Shiok! maki. Question is... shiok or not?
The legendary shiok maki from #kohgrillandsushibar. Worth the hour plus wait. Thanks fifi mouse for bringing me here to break my 5 months vegetarian.. love this to death. Shiok die!
Bento set B. Grilled Salmon teriyaki (not good imo - can hardly ever find a decent one), tempura, agedashi tofu
Crappy maki for the second time this week - better than shiok maki. 
Fried tofu with fish skin topped generously with tobiko, seaweed and bonito flakes! #burpple
This Crappy Maki is nothing crappy. Pretty sure it\'s a spelling error on their part. I officially declare it to be better than both shiok maki. #burpple
My favourite out of the makis. It has a stronger burnt flavour. The unagi, salmon and all simply melts in your mouth!
quite a few days back. finally tried the highly raved Shiok Maki but both @therandomkeith and I weren\'t quite really impressed or Shiok dao by it. \n<br />#深夜美食黨 #sushi #shiokmaki #sgfood \n<br />ok now back to rendering in AE.
Thanks to @xueeees for making us feel like princess today! :D  HEAVENLY SHIOK. xx
Explosion of flavours in your mouth! Shrimp and salmon, drizzled with a generous topping of mentai sauce and roe.
And this is the reason which brought us here. \n<br />Shiok Maki S$16.80 (Heavenly combination of charcoal grilled eel and lightly roasted salmon)
I seldom take iced green tea but since the lady boss recommended this, I shall give it a try. And it\'s awesome! Everyone should try, I don\'t see anyone drinking this. They made this themselves &amp; no preservatives 🍵
The lady boss served us tonight &amp; she\'s super friendly. We actually joked like old friends 😊\n<br />Sashimi Mori S$20
Japanese food again for dinner! 😬\n<br />Sake Aburi Sushi S$4.20
The legendary SHIOK MAKI!! Really super #yummy ! Worth the long queue. $16.80
Not my first time here but the Shiok Maki is still Shiok. Not as Shiok as the first time I tried it. But aburi sushi usually wins every time. Had a few other items too: salmon, tai, maguro sashimi, tofu, garlic rice, foie gras on skewer etc. No thanks to some blogger, this place is now filled with people. Stood in the queue for 45 mins. Remember to make a reservation first. 
2nd gen shiok maki with the chums! Finally ! With @nathanielkendrick @voyagetopluto @steph1909 @paywanqi
Same same but different. 2nd gen (prawn) was disappointing as compared to the original one with unagi. Yummy, but not quite there. (Avocado, prawn and aburi salmon, drenched with cheese sauce +mayo? topped with tobiko)
Fresh!🍣
Tempura ebi maki topped with mentaiko sauce and roe. Explosion of flavors in the mouth but kinda OTT IMHO. 3.5 nombles.
One does not simply come to Wisma Atria without trying it. Shiok ah!
SHIOK MAKI! Finally got to try this much raved about maki and it is indeed, shiok 😊👍 always hungry when w my fav gluttons @deegoes  @sheenyyy #food #omnomz
Now for the signature dish! The shiok maki! Consisting of eel and avocado wrapped in a seaweed roll, covered with Salmon,Mayonnaise sauce and topped with fish roe. This is definitely a must try if you are here! Super shiok!  @kang_h_ming
Assorted sushi with my bento set #burpple
SHIOK MAKI AGAIN WHOOPWHOOP #burpple
Cha soba! The egg is so frigging cute #burpple
Saving the best for last ✌3/12 cravings down! @phipps_ we\'re definitely going for this when you\'re back ☺
Shiok maki is SHIOK. Its like everything good about the world (okay, jap food) rolled into one maki.
Shiok maki! #burpple
Shiok 2nd generation maki (crispy prawn wrapped with roasted salmon S$16.80) ! Omg it lives up to its name - shiok is the right word. Sat in front of the charming boss while he makes sushi for us, he talks &amp; jokes &amp; told his staff to take their time. Q is super long, lots of order but he did it steadily and efficiently. And despite being so busy, he takes our order while still making sushi. Very good service 👍
Shiok Maki - Original. Almost had the entire plate to myself! @emma_loh @choyna @peaberry
So I finally got to try this fantastic shiok maki that everyone has been raving about &amp; I got to say that I was utterly disappointed w what I had today. With the 30 mins wait, over ratings &amp; price, I expected a lot more than I was presented. Worth the try anyway!
THE shiok maki! Stuffed with unagi and avocado, draped with lightly blowtorched salmon and topped with heaps of tobiko, then drenched with a cheesy sauce!
Crispy morsels of grilled eel and creamy avocado rolled into sticky Japanese rice and draped with half-grilled salmon slices, then blanketed with a copious amount of lightly torched mayonnaise sauce and fish roe that promptly pop between your teeth. What else can I say...the name says it all.
As the name suggests, it\'s simply too shiok! Amazing how all the ingredients blend so well. 
The highly raved shiok maki. It was good but not to-die-for.
👍😋

1st Gen shiok maki
$10-$12 (can’t rmb). This plate of yaki-udon is only good on the first mouth, after that it feels like you are eating fried mee.
😍😍😍 ~ many things on the menu were out of stock today surprisingly and then we found out that is the last day of operations as the foodcourt area at @wismaatria will be undergoing renovations 😔 aww... I am gonna missed the makis ... hello there 👋 ~ can we have a shiok maki 1st generation, a crappy maki, 2 BBQ (1 tori and 1 pork belly) and a sukiyaki with ramen please ?

Agedashi tofu.
Shiok Maki. Recommended to order. It\'s really yummy. Ordered 2 plates of Shiok maki and really Shiok till full. 😂 Ordered a chawanmushi too and their chawanmushi is quite different. The ingredients used in it. Definitely will visit for more next time. And yes, better to book a reservation before you visit them if not you will have to wait for a long queue. #BurppleSushiMonth

Topped with special mayonnaise sauce and torched for a smoky flavour. Tobiko (flying fish roe) for added crunch.\n<br />*\n<br />It has a similar taste to the shiok maki. Those who do not like the eel in the shiok maki can try this.

It is another favourite of mine and really is very \'shiok\' (Singapore term for a feeling of sheer pleasure?). An explosion of strong flavours in your mouth in every bite.\n<br />*\n<br />Charcoal grilled eel and avocado wrapped in seaweed, rice and salmon. Topped with a special \'shiok\' mayonnaise sauce and lightly torched for a smoky flavour. A generous helping of tobiko (flying fish roe) is sprinkled on top for crunch.\n<br />*\n<br />This is sometimes referred to as Gen 1 (short for Generation 1) as there is also a Gen 2 with tempura prawn instead of eel. I personally prefer the former.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kohgrill #kohgrill #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Pitan Tofu is one of my favourite dishes at Koh Grill. Chilled tofu with homemade \'pidan\' (century egg) paste and tobiko (flying fish roe). I love pidan so I may be biased here but the homemade paste went so well with the silky soft tofu. The tobiko gave the dish a contrasting bit of crunch. Such a brilliant creation!\n<br />*\n<br />The price is a very reasonable $4. Koh Grill is next to Food Republic in Wisma Atria.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kohgrill #kohgrill #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Maki with eel $16.80\n<br />.\n<br />So many people raved about this dish but sorry it was not worth the calories in my opinion :(. Too much seasonings which made it tasty but couldn\'t tell the taste or freshness of each ingredient. Reasonably priced and good location though.

Been also wanting to try this shop for longest time! Loved oyster bacon wrapped grill and their signature Shiok maki. Really #shiok  #maki #throwback #weekends #japanesefood #sgfood #burpple #igsg
Yummy!! To be honest, I prefer the original, which is charcoal grilled unagi instead of prawn. Nevertheless, still super shiok. 😋
Did you know you can get the best of both worlds by ordering half a portion of Generation 1 (with uni) and Generation 2 (king prawn)? Only $18 for this delicious maki. \n<br />I am glad that the standards are kept with generous amount of topping and filling. It always makes my day to see my good old pal at the sushi chef table.
Staff do not just simply apologize and walk away after making my food fall on the table. One does not simply rush off after food spilling on customer just because the shop is busy. It\'s a 16.80$ sushi and 2.10$ each for god sake. Food\'s fine but extremely horrible service. Never returning again. Not recommended.
Shiok Maki, $16++. Best place for sushi. Generous servings of sushi and also sauce and ingredients!
Enjoy your weekends everyone !
The fried udon was pretty yummy too but this dish was the highlight. Really loved the sauce. #burpple #burpplesg #friedudon #shiokmaki #kohgrill #sgfoodie #whati8today #onthetable #igsg #exploresingapore #sgfood #japanesefood  #tslmakan #stfoodtrending

The Shiok Maki (Gen 1) is creamy &amp; rich in the mouth with a a touch of smokey flavor from the torched mayonaise. Inspite of the rich sauce, the I can still get the sensation of a nice fatty piece of salmon. Biting into one of these plump morsels with the crunchy roe is a lovely treat.

😋 Endured the pain of standing and waiting for more than an hour just to experience this #ShiokMaki that has been taking the world of #burpple by storm! Yep, it has been gaining a lot of recommendations and the reviews seduced me to try! And it was so so damn good!!! 😋😋😋 #japanesefood #sushi #maki #kohgrillandsushibar #food #dinner #foodie #foodporn #instafood #yummy #delicious #love
Even people like @dianaaatan who doesnt like pitan find this yummy!\n<br />I am so missing this now!!!!😭😭😭
If you\'re a fan of century eggs then you should try this dish. First time trying and I\'m already loving it.
Missing it liao 😋😋😋

The food was great, but the queue though! It\'s best to come early so that you don\'t have to queue!! 
It\'s like the relationship in The Karate Kid between Mr Miyagi and Daniel-San, whereby both are excellent in their own aspect. When in doubt, just order both maki rolls and you can have the best of both worlds. The overly indulgence from the salmon roe and melt-in-your-mouth salmon will kickstart you into sushi heaven.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping
Since 18 June is International Sushi Day, let\'s celebrate by having some Shiok Maki ($16.80). The glorious charcoal grilled eel wrapped with lightly toasted salmon before toppling it off with some kewpie mayonnaise and a spread of salmon roe. This is a heart stopping moment as every bite literally melts in your mouth.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#foodart #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

I\'m pretty pleased with its taste and combination 😎\n<br />We went back after a year being disappointed at their #grilled food and given them a second chance. I must say that they have improved a lot since our last visit. 👍🏼
This Shiok Maki- to the most extreme of mainstream. But, it\'s seriously worth the wait, worth the try and worth the money. If you love torched sushi with the infamous mentai (cod roe mayo) sauce, please order and enjoy every bite of it. 
☆ Below average. Taste alot like chinese hawker food
☆☆☆ Shiok but jelat.. gotta share among a few
Having Shiok Maki the day after exams ☺️
