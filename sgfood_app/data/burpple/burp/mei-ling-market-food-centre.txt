We are salivating at this well marinated and herbs infused spare ribs that had been simmered for hours. It is so moist and tender that the meat could just be pulled off from the bone! #makan #musttry #openricesg #burpple #spareribs #pork #chinese #foodphotography #sgig #igsg #sgfood #sgfooddiaries #foodspotting #photooftheday #instafood #instadaily #foodart #nomnom #yum #delicious #savoury #herbs #spices #tender #moist #foodporn #foodgasm #foodies #food
The best sliced chicken hor fun we tried in Singapore so far! One of the few hawkers who actually spend the time and effort to do minimal plating for the generous ingredients. A tantalising treat infused with herbal spices, its a beautiful dish to savour and one which had been humbly serving since 1969! #makanhunt #openrice #burpple #chicken #chinese #horfun #gravy #savoury #mushroom #foodart #foodspotting #foodphotography #photooftheday #instafood #foodstagram #sgig #igsg #igers #sgfood #sgfooddiaries #makan #shiok #yum #foodporn #hawker #musttry
