Because the prata here is so darn good, this humble stall commands a queue, especially on weekends. Everything is made from scratch using fresh, good quality ingredients, which is, sadly, not easy to find at prata stalls these days. Freshly made and fried, the prata here is crispy on the outside, chewy, buttery, very slightly sweet and most of all, not greasy. The kosong is good, but even better is their Coin Prata (essentially prata nuggets, 6 pieces for $3.50) — thicker, crispier, chewier, fluffier. Paired with curry that\'s spicier than the norm, this is one kickass breakfast. Besides prata, they also have nasi briyani, mee goreng, and the like.
Had massive prata craving for weeks now and so my friend scooted me off to Sin Ming road for prata. Boy it was exactly what I needed. The Kosong prata was on the doughy side (though I prefer crispy ones) but it was light and thin, judging by how easy it is to tear it. Egg prata was just delicious with the extremely generous egg portions. The murtabak was not bad, thought the \'skin\' could be crispier. What I loved was the curry base given- not overly salty, extremely flavourful and got a nice slight kick to the tongue. 
getting too famous already \n<br />on another note, the best of part of a hair cut is the hair wash. I love saloons that will take time to scrub and massage your hair and head
longing for this during this weather with some fish curry and a sprinkle of sugar
paper pratas - thin crisp. at times they add chocolate, other places add maple syrup. 🙋🙋 anybody ?
Pretty much my favourite prata - super crisp and very slightly sweet, I prefer this without curry. One of my favourite places to get prata! 
Wanted to try the mutton chop briyani but was too late. Anyway the lamb rib is tender and comes in a big piece not small like other stalls. 
Very tender mutton with nice briyani rice. Yummidelicious. 
Haven\'t had this with my family for a long while. Waited 25 mins for this but it was worth the wait!\n<br />#burpple
Can\'t believe it\'s taken me quite so long to try this place out!
Tucked in the corner of a coffee shop along Thomson Road, Sin Ming Roti Prata has generated quite a following for their house-made dough and freshly made pratas. While this means you have to wait for your prata, it\'s well worth it considering you will be getting a hot, fluffy stack. Try their coin pratas for really crispy, fun bites at 6 pieces for $3.50!

Instead of the usual kosong or telur prata, we were served with their iconic Coin Prata ($4 for 6 pieces) and paired with a Mutton Keema ($3.50), which is available only during the weekends. Not really a big fan of mutton due its gaminess, fortunately there was none of it in this keema and it was an excellent complement to the prata. Besides the minced mutton, the keema contains peas and potatoes. For people who does not want the keema, there’s also the regular chicken, mutton or fish curry priced from $3 onwards.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Sin Ming Roti Prata\n<br />Address: 24, Sin Ming Road, Jin Fa Kopitiam, Unit 01-51, Singapore 570024\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock #tastytastemakertour
🥘\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK TIPS💮: They offer a magnitude of different curries like Fish, Chicken Mutton &amp; more all at (💵S$4) But if you are there in the weekend, order their Keema which is only available in the weekends. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />The tomato purée is quite distinct, along with the usual suspects of garlic ginger paste, all spice powder - turmeric, red chilli powder &amp; garam masala. Order this curry whenever you are here in the weekends. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #TastyTastemakerTour #sinmingprata #sinmingrotiprata #coinprata #prata #keema #keemacurry #mutton #curry #muttoncurry
I am not a prata person. But this coin prata is magic to me. This was the 3rd stop of Amanda’s #TastyTastemakerTour. My first time eating coin prata ($4 for 6 pieces), I was pleasantly surprised at how it isn’t oily like regular prata. It’s slightly crispy on the outside, yet chewy on the inside. It sure feels like I could eat several of this without feeling like I ate a million calories— which, of course, is a LIE. This definitely can’t be healthy…
Having a craving for the coin prata at Sin Ming Roti Prata now which I tried to satisfy tonight but the prata I got was greasy and soggy 😢. These coin pratas were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and well seasoned enough to wolf them down plain! Tonight\'s prata can\'t even hold a candle to them haha. Oh well, the quest for more delicious prata continues!! 💪🏻\n<br />--------\n<br />Sin Ming Roti Prata\n<br />Address: 24 Sin Ming Rd, #01-51, Jin Fa Kopitiam, 570024\n<br />Food: $4.00 for 6 coin pratas\n<br />The place: The place was more comfortable than you would expect of some coffee shops with a clean area and good ventilation\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #lunchtime #coffeeshop #burpple #burpplesg #TastyTastemakerTour #crispy #prata #cheapandgood #plain#cravings #nexttime
Come here for their Coin Prata which every piece is consistently well executed, moist &amp; soft inside with crispy &amp; flaky exterior. Plus it’s not as greasy as other places. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />Another Prata that comes highly recommended by @alhsx is the Mushroom Cheese Prata (💵S$2) that sees the the ingredients spread evenly throughout the thin sinful prata. Do come early or face a queue that might see you ordering more Prata (which is a good thing anyway) 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #TastyTastemakerTour #sinmingprata #sinmingrotiprata #coinprata #prata #rotiprata #roti
Not only is their prata good, but their fried potatoes and curry chicken are worth a try too!
Just stuffed myself with 6 of them. Now I need to swim 30 laps. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodsg #burpple #中年发育

unique way of presenting Prata, and it\'s crispy! (: 
We found one of the best roti prata in Singapore! A beautiful golden brown crisp on the surface with a fluffy texture on the inside. The best part is the accompanying curry which is guaranteed to torch your calories with the abundance of heat! A truly worthy hawker hero is found. #hawkerheroes #sgig #igsg #foodphotography #foodoftheday #foodphoto #foodspotting #foodforfoodies #instafood #sgfood #prata #makanhunt #openricesg #dough #indian #foodgasm #foodart
