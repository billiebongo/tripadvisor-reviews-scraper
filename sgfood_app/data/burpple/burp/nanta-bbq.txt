I hear the boss is Korean himself. The best cold noodles I\'ve had is still in Korea itself though. Nevertheless, still a thumbs-up lunch choice for a sunny day. 👍🏻 #igfood #igeats #foodislove #foodie #hungrygowhere #burpple #burppleSG #sgfood #sgeats #igsgfood #igsgeats #eatoutsg #foodsg #instafood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instafoodie #singapore #yummy #exploreflavours #exploresingaporeeats #honestreviews #shotwithaniphone #iphonewarrior #buckwheatnoodles #coldnoodles #ilovekoreanfood
It was a novelty to wrap them up with a blanket of melted mozzarella and cheddar. Good for 2-3 pax, but eat it fast because the cheese is best at first melt. Everything, except maybe some jokes, is better with cheese. 🧀

Also, a big thanks to the boss that gave us complimentary rice wine for the slightly longer wait!! The sides were really nice too! #ahungrywessg #burpple .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #sg #sgfoodie #foodie #shooteverything #artofvisuals #lunchhour #lunchdinner #lunch #sgeats #vscofood #topcitybites #hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #visitsingapore #koreanbbq #korean #ricewine
M. G. Pork ribs, teppoki and cheese?!!? It was heaven. 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH. The ribs were so tender and they came in thick cuts so that when you bite it, you have a nice chunk of meat rather than shredded pieces. So in love 😍\n<br />#ahungrywessg #burpple .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #sg #sgfoodie #foodie #shooteverything #artofvisuals #lunchhour #lunchdinner #lunch #sgeats #vscofood #topcitybites #hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #visitsingapore #cheese #ribs #koreanbbq #korean

Must order!
Sweet and spicy pork ribs wrapped in cheddar &amp; mozarella melted cheese with steamed Korean egg, nachos chips, tomato salsa, minced pork and slaw as sides. I\'m a cheese lover. Finished the cheese but not the pork rib.\n<br />Rating : 🌝🌝🌝\n<br />.\n<br />Nanta BBQ\n<br />175 Thomson Road\n<br />#01-175/177 Goldhill Centre\n<br />Singapore 307624\n<br />.\n<br />Opening Hours :\n<br />Daily Lunch 11:30am - 3:00pm\n<br />Daily Dinner 6:00pm - 11:00pm\n<br />.\n<br />#sgwanderlust #sgkorean #sgkoreambbq #nantabbq #korean #food #igsg #sgig #singapore #food #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #instafood #foodblogger #wanderlust #cheeseporn #burpple #sgfoodblogger

LOOK AT THAT STRETCH. AND I AM SO GOING BACK FOR MORE.\n<br />.\n<br />🚇Novena. 175 Thomson Road, Goldhill Centre, #01-175. Singapore 307624.
Chicken + Melted Cheese?! OMG i am literally in heaven. The portion is pretty big so definitely get 3-4 person to share! But so is the price tag at $48. But definitely worth trying at least once! .\n<br />.\n<br />. \n<br />#cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #yummy #nommom #feedfeed #onthetable #food #sgfood #foodporn #latergram #foodgram #foodie #foodiesofinstagram #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #TSLmakan #singaporeinsiders #instafood_sg #igdaily #igers #igsg #8dayseat
A perfect dish to stimulate your appetite and counter the hot weather
Generous servings of tender chicken and zesty pineapples laced with lots and lots of melted mozzarella cheese and cooked to a mild spiciness finish. You will need more than 2 hungry cheese lovers to devour this scrumptious dish
Interesting way of eating but pricey! \n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgrestaurant #foodies #koreanfood #korea #nanta #sgfoodporn #vscocam #instafood #igdaily #foodgasm #hungrygowhere #vscofood #instadaily #bbctravel #wanderlust #travelgram #foodporn #mozzarella #cheese #asia #Burpple  #y2eats #y2foodtrail

All eyes on me。
If you can\'t take spicy food, steer clear of this dish. You\'ve been warned！
