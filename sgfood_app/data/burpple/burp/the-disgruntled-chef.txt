The very kind of place you would go for a date night with love ones, or with your favourite girls, just for its ambience. PS. Cafe at Harding Road had a lovely quaint and unhurried atmosphere though it was spotted with quite a crowd on a weeknight.

A couple of years ago, I had the misfortune of eating a less-than-fresh Pineapple Meringue Pie at P.S. Cafe Palais Renaissance. It put me off the dessert completely until last night when a group of us ordered it to share. This time, I was struck dumb by its scrumptiousness. Mainly because every component tasted wonderfully fresh. Also, the crust base was of extreme butteriness which I\'m all for, always. Filling it was a smooth, slightly sweet and tangy pineapple curd that would have earned a \"just right\" rating from Goldilocks. Rising from the fruity filling was a majestic meringue mountain that didn\'t threaten to make our teeth fall out.\n<br />Yep, this one gets to go back into the \"Desserts Worth The Calories\" folder.
Felt that this one has been sitting in the display for a while for the tart base is just about to turn a little bit oily and mushy. The tart largely feels pretty okay, with the sourness of the key lime well managed for it balance out well with a little sweetness — the fresh cream also helps when it may get a little too overpowering. That being said though the key lime filling felt a little flat to me perhaps from the lack of lime pits within.
I have heard about the hype of PS. Cafe\'s truffle fries, and yes I finally can say I have tried it myself. Sure enough, it does lives to the expectations with that truffle aroma going around consistently through the entire portion without being limp from soaking up the truffle oil. The fact that they use shoestring fries also helps for each strand seems to be covered in ample truffle for the flavour to stand out. So addictive that I just went on and on ... speaks so much about my self discipline tsk tsk ...
One of the signatures of PS. Cafe, the Profiteroles were decent but I guess it did not entirely hit my tastebuds. The Choux puffs could be a little bit more moist — the ones we had felt a little aired out for a while though still decent and serviceable, but I would prefer them to be filled with cream than ice-cream (perhaps just my personal preference — melted ice-cream sogging up a Choux is a huge no-no for me). Smothered in chocolate sauce, it\'s luxurious and all, but my preferences for non-chocolate desserts just can\'t really agree with this one.
I love my CNY pineapple tarts, and hearing about this makes me so excited for how often does one hear of a Pineapple Meringue Tart? Ignoring the fact that the tart comes with loads of meringue (everything for the looks), I liked how this was all I had expected — zesty and zingy pineapple tart filling with a tart base that reminds us of the CNY pineapple tarts; just less buttery and jelat (though it will never be jelat for me 😂). Even the meringue is pretty well done; smooth without being over beaten and subtly sweet to help cut the zingy flavours if it ever gets too much. 
If there\'s one place that does over the top, it\'s @pscafe that takes the cake 🙈
The humble golden fry is made glorious here at PS Cafe, thanks to the generous dousing of truffle oil and light-as-air parmesan shavings. Crisp on the outside and tender inside, these shoestring fries are testament to how fries should be. Many have dubbed the Truffle Fries ($15) here (available at all outlets) to be the best truffle fries in Singapore, and we completely agree. The portion is generous and can easily be shared among three to four. If you\'re hankering for something sweet after all that savoury, get the Sticky Date Pudding ($15) — the toffee sauce is spot on! Pro tip: Level up your fries by dipping them in kaffir lime aioli (additional $3).\n<br />Photo by Burppler Clancie Ng
Considering my love for the traditional lemon meringue pie, there\'s something more to this than pure light &amp; refreshing. The tangy pineapple at the bottom adds slight acidity to the not-too-sweet meringue laying atop a crumbly warm base.\n<br />Considering I always have a love hate relationship with diabetic-inducing meringue at many places, this managed to steal my heart. It was also a well paired marriage with their vanilla icecream, music &amp; great atmosphere, I wouldn\'t mind coming back just to have another round of desserts for dinner. Oh but good morning everyone! Today will be a good day 🙏🏻
Okay, $16 for a piece of cake. The cake was very sweet. In fact, too sweet for me. 2/3 of this piece of cake was already filled with marshmallows, which, made it very hard to eat with just a folk. You probably need a knife for this cake. I had to use a spoon with my folk just to avoid the feeling of me eating steaks instead of dessert. At least it was the highlight for the decorations though. Icecream was alright, just a bit softer and creamier than normal icecream. Overall, I\'d say not worth it but maybe I\'m just not a fan of fudge cake and marshmallows.  
This is the dish after I have broken down the stack. Basically an exciting mix of nutty, grainy, fruity, and healthy ingredients. It was very flavorful, surprisingly good considering health food. I think the dish was $26. But to be honest, I\'ve never had any salad style food this good. A bit sour, a bit creamy, a bit sweet, a bit smoky, well, I run out of words. Totally worth it. You should give it a shot. 
Fantastic ambience with such a blissful romantic air. Visit them at night and be serenaded by the lovely candlelit tables and Angel lights. Food is great too- Truffle fries are a must have- with dessert perhaps being the highlight of the meal.
Love: key lime pie, dark chocolate banana cheese cake, sticky date pudding, chocolate nut doorstop. The cakes don\'t come cheap but they\'re delightful! 
The shoestring truffle fries are sinfully delicious. In sharing portion, it\'s a must to order for gatherings for groups. 
PS Cafe has redeemed itself again with these fries. Hands down the best, always 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Grilled portobello w tahini sauce atop caramelised peppers on raisin couscous, herbed lentils and fresh red cabbage &amp; stewed eggplants. Yums! 
Tucking in to an old brunch favourite; a hearty sausage, fluffy scrambled eggs, roasted tomatoes w a basil pesto on a whole-grain brioche. Breakfast for champions indeed. 
Here\'s [PS. Shoestring Truffle Fries S$15] - shared between 2 of us after a Muji meal, and 2 PS. desserts 😱 portion is huge, and I\'m having a sore throat today 😪😪
I love their truffle friesssss❤️ and their desserts are also not disappointed
You can\'t go wrong with this hearty dish. Tossed in the easy-to-love tomato cream sauce are pieces of chicken, smoked bacon, chunks of mushroom and baby spinach.\n<br />On a more general note, I love that P.S. Cafe\'s pastas are cooked perfectly al dente. Portion size of every dish seems to be above average as well. If you have a small appetite or prefer to save some tummy space for desserts, you might want to consider sharing a main course.
This leaped off the board of specials at me. Suffice to say, I was defenseless against its promised deliciousness, which fortunately, was delivered.\n<br />Sweetish, very aromatic and a touch spicy, it\'s a dish that exemplifies a successful East-West fusion. The al dente penne and caramelised pork (which had been shredded up prior) were cooked with pieces of dried chillies and other Asian spices and garnished with plenty of pine nuts, spring onions and coriander. The only thing I wasn\'t so keen on was the rather excessive oiliness about it.\n
Banana Blueberry Pancakes, Truffle Fries and Pad Thai Salad. Food at PS. Cafe never fails, and the branch at Dempsey is my favourite out of all branches. Love the ambience and service here is always consistently good. And of course the truffle fries!! Even if it means you are over-ordering, you still have to order that plate of truffle fries!
Had a hankering for some sugary treats this evening. So, of course, sticky date pudding was a necessary thing. Added the ginger pudding and double chocolate cake because it\'s the weekend and we just wanted them in our bellies, darn it! Everything was good. I have a serious soft spot for the ginger pudding. Something about the spicy and sweet. My strawberry milkshake came out too sweet but all the other coffees (cafe lattes and Irish coffee) were more than decent. Everything came up to about 100 bucks. It\'s all good at PS. Cafe.
TGIF! Gonna mug before meeting the homs for Hotpot ✌🏻️\n<br />|\n<br />Anyway Three Bistro review is up on the blog. If you\'re thinking of a place to chill tonight, this might be for you. My readers are entitled to a 10% off for the ala carte menu. More details on the web, www.jacqsowhat.com (link in bio) 🍻
the portions here are reaaaalllly huge.... but super nice though it got rather \'gelat\' after awhile. but the cakes here are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wheeeeeee
Paired with a pot of tea and this is how Public holiday should be spent. Because anytime is dessert time.
Open till late, this is just the spot for a little \"after-party\" -- with some truffle fries of course! Indulge in a decadent chocolate cake if you haven\'t had your fill of sweets for the week.
NZ Riesling, longans, lychees, rambutans, white chrysanthemum flowers, lemon soda
We had the P.S Burger; our grilled wagyu and US chuck patty is medium rare, topped with gruyère cheese, spinach, crispy bacon, tomato and onion! Perfect dish to kick start the long weekend. TGIF everyone :)
Their branches at Harding Road, Ann Siang Hill Park, and Palais Renaissance only close their doors at 1-2am on Fridays and Saturdays, providing a lovely cafe environment for supper indulgence. Have a couple of drinks enjoyed with their signature tarts, cakes, and puddings. What a way to wind down after a long week!
Their quiche is fluffy and light, and has the smooth texture light HK egg tart, savoury in this case of course. The thin layer of roasted onion with vinaigrette reduction gives character to the quiche.
Recommended dessert. Very chocolaty cake sprinkled with chilli powder for 2 to share. 
Best truffle fries you never want to miss. Price range of the cafe $20-$40. Environment for this outlet; 4/5
I\'ve always thought that their truffle fries are overly hyped up. Ps cafe has always been my favorite place for cakes and tea. But now I\'m officially a fan of their fries! These are no ordinary shoestring fries, love the texture and generously infused with truffle oil. It\'s a must try albeit pricier, the serving was really huge! (Sharing for 3-4) a romantic place (Harding road) to chill at night. 
For truffle lovers, the strong aroma of the truffle when it\'s being served is good enough to make you happy! A generous sprinkle of mild cheese on top was just the right combination.. Lovely but remember to take lots of water after to avoid heatiness..

PS. Cafe is one of my favorite for a late night dessert date. The one at Dempsey opens till midnight and it\'s so convenient should hunger strikes in wee hours. The sticky date pudding is one of my favorite at Ps. Cafe, definitely a sinful dish :)
Really made me blackout with the portion but it\'s really nice and not too sweet.
Early Christmas celebration. Super early one before @vallychua flies awayyy #xmas #brunch #omnomnom
rich creamy choc with tons of pecan nuts! goes very well with the vanilla cream :)
They are famous for sticky pudding and truffle fries of cos it didnt disappoint! 
So, so decadently good. Not too sweet, and perfectly chocolatey. Still think my mom\'s chocolate cake is hard to beat though 😉 For $14.90, this is one expensive piece of cake. That said, you\'re really paying a premium for the gorgeous ambience.
The winning touch to this classic is the crotons which soaked up so much of the pomodoro sauce and cheese while this was baked.
Seafood Chowder, and Maple Roasted Pork with Caramelized Apples, Rocket &amp; Crispy Shallot Mayo on M\'s Organic Ciabatta
Filled with grilled peppers and BBQ Corn Beef, topped with a sunny side up and crispy potato skin.
Tortilla wrap with egg roll, grilled peppers and onions, topped with a grilled chorizo, sour cream, avocado, chopped onion and tomato.
Sticky date pudding with butterscotch sauce. Best sticky date pudding ever #stickydate #dessert #icecream
Must have!

Aside from being a very nature-y place for brunch, PS Cafe serves very decent food as well. Ordered their Big Breakfast ($30ish++ ✌🏻) - with scrambled eggs, roasted tomato, basil pesto, bacon, toast, and sausages. Enjoyed the sausages the most; bacon was a tad bit hard and bland (i like em very crunchy haha). The ambience made up for it tho! Perfect for brunch dates :)\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#reemuuheats #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #foodies #singapore #whattoeatsg #whati8todaysg #sgeats #instafood_sg #foodstagram  #breakfast #brunch #sgmakandiary #eeeeeats #nomnomnom  #foodpornsg #foodgasm #sgfoodporn #foodporn #foodagram #igsg #spotmyfood #whattoeatph #igersph #foodieph #burpple #pscafe #cafe

This was so savoury with the salty cheese with the smoked ham, but oh so good. Go for the Croque Madame for a fried egg on top.
