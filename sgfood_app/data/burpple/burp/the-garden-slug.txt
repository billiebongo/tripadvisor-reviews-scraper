With ribeye steak strips, lamb sirloin, sausages and a whole flavorful mashed potatoes. Big portion for 2 pax at $45!
The \"Big Breakfast\" - a ubiquitous item on nearly every cafe\'s menu, yet not all of them live up to the name. Well, this one does. For $19.90, you get a large plate filled with lots of tasty things: 2 fried eggs, 3 sausages (2 of one type and 1 of another), bacon, saut√©ed mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, a slightly oily hash brown and 2 thick slices of toasted walnut bread. Those with healthy appetites will appreciate the portion size. Those without, can gladly share (like the family I spotted doing so). Unfortunately for coffee connoisseurs, the caffeine concoctions here aren\'t much to shout about. 
The Runny Salmon Scramble ($15.90++) that I tried at this rustic neighbourhood cafe was really quite good. The eggs seemed to have had loads of butter and milk/cream added, so the result was very silky and creamy. I found the smoked salmon a bit on the salty side but the bread was a wonderful surprise. Instead of ho-hum generic slices, the two thick pieces of toast had lovely chopped walnuts in them. 
S$21.50.. Pork, chicken and beef+pork sausages atop a generous serving of mash! Yummy! 
I have to say, that this being my third visit AND third order of the pumpkin and shrimp pasta at TGS... I made the right choice to follow my intuition on all three occasions. There\'s just something about this dish - perhaps an illusion of it being a somewhat healthy dish, or the exoticness of pumpkin (yes, prior to my first visit I never had pumpkin in my life; now it\'s a different matter üòè) idk - which makes me want to order it again and again! 
This flat white is really not up to par for a brunch restaurant ~disappointing
Food is not too bad.nice place for pets n friends
The glass was a crunchy chocolate something, lemon cake, matcha cake and chocolate cake. Nothing that dazzled. 
The cream is a tad heavy after a few bites. Best to share w friends~
The salmon inside is smoked salmon so it might be a bit salty for some taste buds but it goes perfectly with the lightly tossed salad at the side. 
The breadstick is very crispy! The soup can be a bit too pasta-saucey...
Time for some real coffee. Tastes decent. Strawberry ice cream is yum! (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë) 
The food is nice. The coffee tastes like its from a Nescaf√© machine. Extremely diluted and undrinkable!!! (‚ï¨ ‡≤†Áõä‡≤†)
Stuffed with Chunks of Chocolate Meteorites atop Shortbread Crumble, and slow-melting vanilla gelato dotted with whole raspberries

Comes with herbed olive oil and vinegar. Love it! #mushroomlover\n<br />Also had the Wasuga chicken wings and I like that it comes with lots of cherry tomatoes! Feels less sinful haha #delusional
Acceptable taste. No wow factor though.

Probably one of the closest Cafes to my home, the garden slug rarely disappoints. It has special themed food items during festive occasions eg. St Pats Day, Mid-autumn that makes visiting this place a more refreshing affair. The Nutella iced chox available here is DOPE.  The sides and top of the glass were lined with ten kinds of decadence and sin, and scrapping off the Nutella and stirring it with the already rich iced chox gave it a rich hazelnut texture and a more wholesome experience. A different kind of standard for iced chox in my opinion. The smoked salmon omelette was fluffy and moist, but the crispy and buttery toast was definitely the star. The garden slug serves all-day breakfast so eating eggs and ham at 7pm while watching rabbits hopping about in the pet shop across road can be quite an exciting experience! 4/5 #thegardenslug #nutellaicedchocolate #icedchox #brunch #smokedsalmonomelette #secretlifeoffatbacks
Real mashed potatoes! ... Unseasoned... With a weird vinegary-tasting sauce... :(
