So shiny!üò≤üòé Another festive treat available for takeaway @cpchangiairport at only $4.50+ or even better, get it with the Ispahan macaron, salted caramel lollipop (pics in previous posts) and Blackforest for just $20+ //Good deal, why not?;)
Must go buffet!!!! Although the spread is not as good as other buffets, it\'s more of quality rather than quality :) desserts are really good and not as sweet. Portions are small so that you get to try every dessert!!!
The Weekend Changi Brunch experience is not complete without Azur‚Äôs unique interpretation of hawker favourites. Here\'s a photo of kong ba pau. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/azur-launches-new-weekend-changi-brunch-menu/
