They might be known for their amazing breads, but their baked goods is something that you can\'t ignore either!
Couldn\'t decide between \"everything cream cheese\" and \"fried egg + hot sauce\", so of course I did not hesitate when presented with the option that gives you both. 
These were $4 each, really worth it imo!! They were really generous with the spreads/toppings and I loved the combinations (sage cream cheese + berry compote?? Yummm). I\'m also not usually a big fan of harder breads but I liked how the sourdough was chewy and how the flavour develops as you chew.
Hummus, Sage cream cheese with berry compote, Nut butter with honey. So so delicious!! Even the crust was good üëçüèª my fav was the hummus one because I love savory foods and the flavours were very balanced, making it an amazing brunch/tea break dish.
I like my heroes complicated &amp; brooding, James Dean in oiled leather, leaning on a motorcycle. You know the color. (\"Ode to Chocolate\") üç´\n<br />.\n<br />They serve more than superb Sourdoughs, come for their Pizza Nights. Pizza is on Sunday nights (5pm to 9pm or till the dough runs out) where they make naturally leavened pizza Neopolitan style. All pizzas are meatless but they are so big on flavor you won‚Äôt miss the meat, especially when with quality ingredients &amp; a good crust. üîñ
How about Sourdough with Hummus or Peanut Butter Sriracha from Woodlands Sourdough? Both were equally good! From $3.00 per slice, there\'s other varieties to choose from.
Price: $4
I love little places like this. Even more so if it\'s in my neck of the woods. I decided to go with one sweet and one savoury. I went with the nut butter, honey and sea salt ($4) - the slightly gritty nut butter was laid on pretty thickly, which I like, and went very well with the honey. I couldn\'t really taste the salt but I still really enjoyed this. For the savoury, I had the Vegemite, butter and cheddar ($4) - the cheddar was nice and sharp, and grated over the top of Vegemite toast. I personally prefer my cheese a little meltier with my Vegemite - but it was still quite enjoyable. 
Finally got to try The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough.
The sourdough bread is flavourful &amp; fluffy although we would have liked the crust to be slightly crisper (&amp; less hard; found some bits quite difficult to bite through). J ordered the nut butter one and didn\'t quite like it as it was too sticky &amp; the sweetness of the peanut butter and honey was an odd combi with the sourness of the bread (but this could just be his personal taste). C enjoyed her well-seasoned hummus toast for its flavourful chickpea &amp; herby taste.\n<br />üìç@woodlandssd, #01-05 Serene Center, S258748
Luscious, Rich &amp; Thick Nut Butter topped with Honey &amp; Salt for that Salty Sweet goodness. ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />Love the sage touch in the cream cheese that marries well with the acidity of the berries. Of course the highlight here is the Sourdough. (So good that you can even eat on its own)*that tagline* It has become my personal Mission to try all the breads &amp; Flavours of toast @woodlandssd üññüèª
Slathered with a generous amount of their respective spreads coupled with a rustic yet simple presentation, these toasts were already visually astounding (and appetite-inducing!!!) upon arrival. Came with high expectations to finally try these babies, and boy WAS I SATISFIED. 
Ordered the toast with sage cream cheese and berry compote ($4), and lemon sesame tea cake ($5) to share, and both were so good?!? I love the Sourdough toast which is so moist and still easy to cut through, not like some other sourdough bread which I\'ve had elsewhere which can be really hard and tough to \"saw\" through. Only downside is that it\'s too small! We can only blame ourselves but then we were heading someplace else thereafter for lunch. The cream cheese was sinfully good and berry compote not sweet at all, instead it had a nice tanginess that balances out the cream cheese.
We decided on the Lemon Sesame tea cake, and which is not too bad but I could only tell it\'s sesame from seeing the black sesame seeds in it, as the flavour/taste didn\'t come out at all. Perhaps if it was heated up before being served it might have helped? At $5 per slice, my friend remarked it\'s a little pricey but that\'s the standard loaf cake price I guess...
Needed my caffeine fix but this coconut cold brew was nasty. üò©üò´üò©üò´
Was disappointed in the service yesterday when we waited quite long for the toast to be serve, worse was when 4-5 other orders were out but ours still MIA. But all things said, their sourdough compensate for it.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough\n<br />Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Unit 01-05 Serene Centre, Singapore 258748\n<br />#woodlandssd
This artisan bakery is located at Serene Centre which is at Bukit Timah. The sourdough is extremely HARD but the toppings on top is delicious!!! The Hummus Za\'atar EVOO toast is so good. You could see that they spread a generous amount of that on top of that sourdough and it is so creamy. The Sage Cream Cheese Berry toast was good too. You can also see they spread a generous amount of cream cheese on the sour dough as well. Just a wonderful medley of sweet and sour. Please do not order the Coconut Cold Brew though. So bitter and.... yuck. lol
Nut Butter with Honey.
Sage Cream Cheese + Berry Compote; Vegemite + Cheddar; Nut Butter + Honey; Egg Salad + Dukkah;
But first thing first, need to have some tasty breakfast before doing anything.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough\n<br />Address: 10 Jalan Serene, Unit 01-05 Serene Centre, Singapore 258748
This place - The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough is now my favourite go-to for a cup of coffee. I always ask for a skinny cappuccino, made by the lovely female barista with a beautiful smile. üòä enjoyed this cup with a chocolate orange cardamom bun at 4 pm on a weekday.
Nut butter and honey toast\n<br />Sage cream cheese and berry compote toast
Went around 10am in the morning and the freshly baked loaves had since sold out, luckily we managed to get our hands on Nut Butter with Honey ($4) and Egg Salad with Dukkah ($5). 
Always a good day if I am here for breakfast. Going for an item over the counter, the Bilmy with Cream Cheese was a delightful breakfast treat ‚Äî the sort of thing I would go for if I were to crave for something savoury early in the morning. Crusty bread, that amazing fermentation of the sourdough that matches up to the rich and velvety smooth cream cheese and the sweet caramalised onions on the top; a pleasure to have!
üçûSOURDOUGH IS AN ACTUAL GAME-CHANGER!!!üçû\n<br />‚Ä¢ $4 each for cream cheese &amp; berry compote + nut butter &amp; honey sourdough toast\n<br />‚Ä¢ tastes gooood but pretty out of my usual radius......considering how it\'s simple and how the seats are usually packed (+ there\'s no fans ‚òπÔ∏è), i won\'t come here often\n<br />‚Ä¢ but go anyway!! it\'s p worth it~\n<br />‚Ä¢ also u might wanna head down earlier before the crowd comes‚Ä™
for $5 and $4 respectively, these toasts were everything i had wished for to satisfy my late morning hunger pangs!!! the toasts itself were nice and crispy, but with the addition of the sweet / savoury goodness on top, these became amazing. i\'ll definitely be back for more! üòãüíì
And finally got to try the nut butter and honey toast (they ran out by the time I was there the last time). I think it\'s new my favorite toast! I must also tell you about the wonderful crust and the amazing bread - you really need to try it to believe it. A great Sunday made better! #burpple
Cupping Profile
Glad i able to having an Egg Salad and Dukkah with Onion on sourdough toast ($5.00) for my breakfast.
I\'m slowly on my way to try all the toasts that they have to offer. All toasts are of the country loaf variety, but if you buy a whole loaf, you can choose from what they have on the shelf. I feel that since I last visited, the size of the toast has shrunk slightly, though.
Tried 5 of the toast on the menu finally after wishlisting for a while. 
We ordered 5 of the toast:\n<br />Nut butter with honey\n<br />Sage cream cheese with berry compote\n<br />Dukkah egg salad\n<br />Spiced hummus \n<br />Vegemite and cheese
I\'ve first came to know about Woodlands Sourdough at the Loewen Farmer\'s market in Dempsey which happens on saturdays only, usually once every 1 to 1.5 months. 
‚Ä¢\n<br />From the fresh crisp breads painstakingly baked dailies to the many fillings available, everything is lovingly homemade. I really liked the hummus the best. Thick and insanely creamy, it was well seasoned and had just the right amount of cumin without it being too overpowering.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />It does get pretty warm because it\'s all alfresco dining so try and get there early. Or simply just get it to go.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Food (8/10)\n<br />Ambience (6/10)\n<br />Overall (7/10)
$4, $3.50. In my head I\'m thinking woah it\'s gonna be so worth it. But sigh I was wrong one of my breads was so thinly cut that I thought a little of it was almost gone. P.s the loaf\'s $6, should have gotten that instead. \n<br />Sage cream cheese with berry compote ($4) was tart and the compote was just too watery, sugar yes please. Nut butter combi was well-executed. Savoury and sweet.
You\'d have to wake up early to head to this bakeshop in Serene Centre if you want to try their legendary sourdoughs ‚Äî they sell out as early as noon on weekdays, and sometimes even earlier on weekends. A once familiar sight at farmer\'s markets, the husband-wife duo now has a cosy brick-and-mortar space where they churn out whole loaves of sourdough, toasts, sandwiches and excellent coffee ‚Äî perfect for slow mornings. Our Burpple community loves the house made Nut Butter, Honey and Sea Salt ($3.50) as well as the Sage Cream Cheese and Berry Compote ($4) from the toast menu. Hot pressed sandwiches like the simple but satisfying Kimchee + Cheddar ($7) are only sold on weekdays, while open-faced savoury toasts like the Egg Salad + Dukkah ($5) are available daily. Wash it down with an excellent Hand Brew ($5) or Flat White ($5.50) with beans from Cata Coffee, a small local roaster. Before leaving, select a loaf of excellent sourdough to bring home! Note that flavours differ daily (check their Facebook page).\n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Raine Liu
Thanks to @burpple I got to know about this hot new bakery at Serene Centre. I initially ordered the vegemite and cheddar toast, but upon seeing this beauty being prepared behind the counter I quickly switched  my order and boy I am I glad I did.
sage cream cheese and berry compote + peanut butter sriracha and lime //
I sat alfresco eating no-frills sourdough toast. Nut butter honey and chocolate marmalade. Barista from Monmouth London who roasts the beans she sources. #nuffsaid
This place may be known for their breads and toasts, but man, these guys make some seriously delicious baked goods. There\'s always something different each time I\'m here, and today it\'s this salty-sweet chewy cookie that\'s just perfect with their Sidamo hand pour üëåüèª
Moist, chewy center and slightly charred crust spread w housemade nut butter and honey drizzled. I\'m so happy we have a bakery dedicated to sourdough üòå
sourdough made with heart. it has to be you know, you need to make one heck of a culture before making a tasty sourdough. so you can feel their sincerity in their prodice. while sourdough is not out to please everyone, their perfect crust and chewiness makes it welcoming for all to try. not a big fan of drip coffee but if sourdough is already relatively new to you, why not give their cata coffee a try. the fruity finish in the coffee goes very well with the subtle bread tartness!
Had to make my way to school on an off day to work on a school assignment; there was time for breakfast so it was a trip down to Serene Centre to grab a sandwich from The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough before heading to school to meet the group mates.
Forgot to ask about the beans used for the coffee here and didn\'t have the time when I was about to leave, but the Flat White was very balanced despite its light body ‚Äî creamy and smooth with a hint of nutty and earthy flavours which is everything that\'s soothing in a cuppa.
Finally had the opportunity to try this place out for myself despite being only ten minutes from my place. The nut butter with honey and sea salt spread was awesome, but there wasn\'t enough bread for me since I was told that I got the last slice of bread for the day. Unfortunately that meant that I got the thin end slice :( Guess the early bird catches the bigger slice of bread.
This was the last cookie, and the staff really kindly gave it to me for free, thank you soooo much! I felt really, really bad but I enjoyed it so much and was really, really happy on the inside üòÇ It was a much needed pick-me-up after my day. Don\'t be deceived by its appearance, because I expected the cookie to be very crunchy, but it was actually really chewy yet firm to the bite. I think they used a mix of old fashioned rolled oats as well as steel cut oats to get the texture of the cookie which was more chewy than crunchy. (And as someone who lovesss chewy cookies this was a win for me.) This tastes SO MUCH better than Subway Oatmeal Cookies, and they were super generous with the raisins inside the cookie that every bite had a few pieces. Not only do they make a hella good toast, they also make a lot of other yummy bakes. Their bakes are rotational, so expect something different every week!
Missing this lovely toast I had last week. The addition of sage into the cream cheese was subtle, and paired together with their homemade berry compote that wasn\'t overly sweet, with a adequate amount of tang, made this a really homely combination. I love how they make the toppings not overly fanciful, but really as authentic and organic as possible. And their Sourdough is sooo good, it\'s perfectly crisp on the outside and yet just chewy and airy enough on the inside. I wanted to get a loaf that day but they were all sold out!!! (You really have to get there early to get your hands on one!) üçû
Finally made plans here thanks to all the good folks constantly raving on Burpple! Sage Cream Cheese with Berry Compote ($4) was every bit a savoury toast with lovely flavour from the sage cream cheese and that tinge of tangyness with minimal sweetness. Also really enjoyed the mountain of egg salad with aromatic dukkah, topped with pickled onions!
Always intrigued by sourdough bread but never baked one cos aiya~ the starter like very mafan leis~ So I\'ll pay and this is a good place if you want some really good sourdough bread!
this place has been popping up everywhere on social media so i figured i\'d give it a shot. was pretty quiet when i came by at 9 but it seems\n<br />that everyone who ordered the toast was taking a picture (or 100) of it before eating hahahahaha.
[Halal] The last addition to the sourdough series! This was perhaps my favourite one among all three variations. Not that the quality of both the chocolate or the marmalade was excellent, but I really liked it simply because was a fitting, or perhaps an inherent, combination. In addition, I may or may not be biased towards sweeter flavours. üò¨
[Halal] A continuation of the sourdough series - the Hummus Za\'atar. The familiar garlicky flavour of the traditional chickpea-based dip is what makes it so enjoyable from the first bite all the way to the last one. üòã
[Halal] Oh yeeeeaaaahhh I finally got around to making my way to this humble hideout that mostly utilises the sourdough bread. To no surprise, their selection of photogenic toasts have made their way to Instagram and Burpple in the last month. And that includes their sage cream cheese toast with berries compote. üåøüßÄüçìüçíüçû
Omg new fav! Thank goodness we had more people eating today, the perfect chance to try a new toast. I usually get the hummus and the nut butter cos they\'re irresistible, but this is now a strong contender that might just replace the hummus every once in a while. The egg salad is flavored in a mild curry-like spice mix, bound together with just enough creaminess and nicely offset by the pickled onion. What a yummy slice this was!
Finally visited @woodlandssd after hearing so much about it! \n<br />Even before 10am on a rainy Saturday, this place was packed with people enjoying their sourdough and coffee. I definitely was not disappointed at all! \n<br />Had their Sage Cream with Berry Compote ($4), Nut Butter with Honey ($3.50) and Hummus Zaadar with Evoo ($4) - all was equally yummy but for me I love the Hummus one the most for the smooth velvety texture that went superbly well with their toast and the best Pour over Coffee!!
‚òîÔ∏èSome brain food for my mid-terms later. \n<br />Hummus was really tasty with that touch of olive oil and sourdough was very rustic. But would be better if the crust wasn\'t so hard and tough. üòÖüôä would have gone for a second slice if my teeth weren\'t hurting üôà The filtered sidamo coffee was good though! Slightly fruity and light. Always love how a perfectly controlled filtering process brings out the flavours of the coffee. üç¥\n<br />#burpple #thebakery #woodlandssourdough #toast
If this toast doesn\'t scream \'eat meeee\' I don\'t know what does. The hummus here is insanely good, being creamy and fragrant. That\'s the power of pure, homemade goodness. I may be really loyal to their nut butter, honey and sea salt (which is simply divine) but this savoury option also sits well in my books. On a side note, their Sourdough bread is soooo good but I see on Instagram that the owners are still trying to perfect their bread. Really goes to show their dedication and effort in making their bread. More for me please üôãüèª!!
Funny story: their FB/Insta page said that they open at 8am; went there and found out that they actually opened at 8.30am, and even later found out that they actually only started serving their breads at 9amüòÖ thankfully, it was worth the wait (-: a big, generous slice of amazing sourdough (thick and dense, but still not the most sour one I\'ve had!) with a copious amount of homemade hummus, dashes of za\'atar and EVOO (-: paired with a flat white (which was quite underwhelming, heard that they\'re more famous for their drip coffee/cold brews so I\'ll give that a try instead next time). Wasn\'t too hungry that day but if I was, would probably be able to have 2 slices on my own! Really good place, glad to have discovered this through a good friend of mine (-: can\'t wait to be back to try out more! (-:
such enjoyable hard crust encasing the glorious airy bits with barely perceptible soft tangy punctuation.. of course you wouldn\'t know that is a freshest slice of sourdough underneath the generous bed of home made nut butter! clearly, that drizzle of honey and specks of sea salt made to serve the spread only, bringing out the bestest of the nut butter. forget espresso shot milk coffee, cause you want to elevate and harmonise the whole experience with drip. so niche a bakery for sourdough lovers and those who wish to be a convert.
|\n<br />My order nut butter and honey ($4), hummus ($4.50) and egg salad ($5) and batch brew ($3) .\n<br />|\n<br />After having seriously good sourdough in Hong Kong and Cambodia, I had been looking for good ones in Singapore. .\n<br />|\n<br />A warm and familiar fresh baked welcomed my appetite with open arms. While I was deciding which toast to order, I was totally distracted by the fresh baked beside the counter. .\n<br />|\n<br />Even though the ones I order was exactly sourdough, they were still good. Sourdough based loaf topped with their creamy hummus, nutty nut butter and well balanced egg salad. Middle East flavors based toast made them pretty unique. For those who don\'t like fennel seed, I would recommend to stick with their nut butter. It will be better if they can served on a tray instead of plate. The bottom won\'t moist up and letting the texture to be soften.
The house-made sourdough at this Muslim-owned micro bakery is not fluffy or light. It is substantial. I would compare it to a sturdy pillow or even a cushion - the kind that doesn\'t flatten under your head but provides enough support for a good sleep. Besides the weight, it has a subtle flavour, and wonderful chewiness.\n<br />Every order of toast gets you a thick slice that\'s generously spread with your choice of topping (most of which are made in-house as well).\n<br />If you are into this kind of carbs, be prepared to make regular trips down once you\'ve had a taste.
The fabulousness of their house-baked bread fits a minimalist approach in spreads. But trust me, deliciousness was at maximum level.\n<br />We tried the popular nut butter with honey and sea salt flakes ($3.50), as well as the new vegemite with cheddar ($4) and were very pleased with both.\n<br />Thanks @iamjaynedoe for sharing your discovery on Burpple, and @that_dex for sealing the deal with your equally tempting post that I absolutely needed to visit this place! üòÑ
Assorted toppings (mostly made in-house) spread generously over perfectly toasted sourdough bread with a crispy crust and soft chewy insides. Loved the nut butter, which had none of that gummy texture that commercially produced nut butter can have. Coupled with the honey and sea salt flakes, it was a pretty darn perfect piece of toast. Cafe au lait was sadly a bit weak which was a waste...
Tucked away at the corner of Serene Centre sits a humble micro bakery - The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough,  that I must recommend to anyone who is serious about their bread. This #Burpproved Muslim-owned bakery offers an array of cookies, cakes, handcrafted naturally leavened breads that are simply mouth-watering when paired with their homemade spreads and toppings.
Banana Tea Cake ($5 nett) - a little too buttery for me, but otherwise good flavour. Not too sweet; the natural sweetness comes from the banana &amp; dates.
Pictured: Sage Cream Cheese on Sourdough Toast ($4 nett), Hand Brew ($5 nett)
D a r k Choco toast ü•ñüç´ rich in indulgence, great with that sour tangy toast to go ‚ô•Ô∏è
Finally finally finally made my way down here! Unfortunately for me, my brunch timing was more like lunch timing and apparently all the toasts had been snapped up. (If you\'re coming down on a Sunday come early as their toasts are lower on supply because they\'re closed on Mons and Tues üèÉ)
Beetroot Hummus Sandwich ($7)\n<br />Chocolate Oats Walnut Cookie ($2)\n<br />Salted Chocolate-Rye Cookie ($2)\n<br />Orange Cranberry Mint Tea ($2.50)
I loveeee peanut butter and I always get those jars of goodness natural (no premixed sugar &amp; oil etc) so I really appreciated this. Crunchy country bread that was dense enough to hold up a generous heaping of the nut butter. Basically a deconstructed version of the generic nut butter in a jar, but served straight up without the other nonsense. Simple &amp; natural goodness.\n<br />I only wished for an option to substitute their other breads for the standard country bread, but that may be asking for too much.
Breakfast // Sage cream cheese on sour dough ‚Ä¢ A creamy yet not-so-heavy dairy goodness paired with a lil sweetness from the berry compote, thank you berry much~ also feat. here with a nut (almond I think) butter toast on sour dough with a sprinkle of sea salt and honey on the side! Windy sunday mornings be like.. üå¨üëíüåøüçÉüçÉgoodfoodmustshare!
Really loving this combination, so inspired to make my own Hummus now and slather it generously on toast. Topped with a pinch of rosemary spices and drizzled with a touch of olive oil elevates not just the taste but the aesthetics. What\'s great is also the numerous ovens at the back (yup freshly baked) and the health benefits of Sourdough toast. A great breakfast option at a quaint corner of Serene center. I see myself back her for more of their other Sourdough toast options for sure. üòõüçû 
A must-order when we\'re here! They were totally slammed on the weekend, and understandably, they started to serve ready-made sandwiches instead of their hot-pressed ones which would take a while to prepare. We tried the pea hummus one with feta and rocket, perfect. Sorry I don\'t have a photo of that!! In other news, they now have a super nice barista (from Japan\'s Blue Bottle) banging out fantastic coffees!! Had a great flat white üëåüèª
Damn good! Hummus spread with rosemary, spices &amp; olive oil sprinkled on the sourdough toast. So simple yet so fulfilling. Loved hummus since the day Zohan introduced it to me 10 years ago. #nofilter
I was really sad when G√¶st closed down (best sourdough I\'ve had in SG!), but I\'m missing it a little less now that we have this. While I wouldn\'t say that the styles are similar, the denser loaves here will make any sourdough lover happy, esp after seeing the pocket-friendly prices. üòç\n<br />Since they don\'t have proper kitchen space, fillings and spreads are very simple (FYI, no meat or eggs); they are however, all homemade and give you that warm fuzzy feeling. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Tried the hummus + dukkah, almond butter + honey, and sage cream cheese + berry compote. 
Buttery, crumbly crust with the natural, gentle sweetness of the apples makes for a great snack with drip coffee or a cup of tea. #burpple
Appearing in farmer\'s markets over the last four years, this micro bakery has now settled in a small brick-and-mortar bakeshop in Serene Centre, much to the delight of Burpplers. Located next to Sugarhaus, this humble bakery cranks out whole loaves of sourdough, toasts, sandwiches and excellent coffee ‚Äî perfect for slow mornings. From the toast menu, go for the Nut Butter, Honey and Sea Salt ($3.50) that the Burpple community really loves, as well as the Sage Cream Cheese and Berry Compote ($4). All toast toppings are made in house! From their selection of hot pressed sandwiches, try the comforting Kimchee + Cheddar ($7) for a warm, simple lunch. Wash it down with a Hand Brew ($5) or Cold Brew ($5.50). Before leaving, select a loaf of excellent sourdough to bring home! Note that favours differ daily (check their Facebook page). Pro tip: For better storage, they don\'t slice the loaf for you and recommend you to slice only as needed. No gluten-free options available. \n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jonathan Wong
Toasted sourdough with homemade sage cream cheese and berry compote, this sweet, salty combination with a touch of earthiness from the sage made every bite such a joy. A simple yet delectable morsel accompanied by drip coffee on ice, this was an treat to perk up some alone time on the weekend. #burpple #thebakerybywoodlandssourdough
Ugh, so good. A hearty slab of sourdough topped with very good house made almond butter and a drizzle of sweet honey with sea salt for balance. A perfect breakfast with their reliable Hand Brew ($5) to wash it down.
Generous spread of creamy delicious hummus on sourdough toast, sprinkled w dukkah &amp; a drizzle of olive oil üíõ redefining the classic toast experience for me! Wash this down w a cup of black coffee for a perfect start to my day.
The perfect breakfast dessert ‚ù§Ô∏è Don\'t be underwhelmed by that dollop of berry compote. That\'s really all the sweetness you need for that savory sweet balance üçì simple &amp; oh so satisfying.
This tiny bakery is completely focused on heir sourdoughs, a mission that makes bread lovers like me very happy. It\'s hard to find young people this passionate about making good loaves, and I\'m glad to have found them in Serene Centre. Here\'s a hot pressed sandwich which was filled with what is best described as stuffing (like Christmas stuffing), with the main flavours being sage and black pepper. While I enjoyed this savoury sandwich, I did wish there were some pops of sweetness in there for balance, kinda like how you\'ll take a spoonful of roasted pumpkin here n there on your holiday plate, instead of finishing all the stuffing at one go. The breads are lovely, a touch heavy, and with a tang that good sourdough should have. The coffee is excellent. I had the hand brew with Ethiopian beans, really nice with this easy breakfast.
Fret not if you are in for tea at The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough for they also serve donuts which are great for mid-day snack. Using sourdough for their donuts, the donuts are pretty firm than fluffy but at the same time, not too dense ‚Äî one will find that it delivers a very clean bite through without having to wrestle with the donut to bite it off. Glazed with a Masala Chai glaze, it comes with just a hint of the said spices tea aroma with a little sweetness from the sugar used to make the glaze, while the sourdough lends its fermented flavour towards its finish.
From The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough, which opened pretty recently at Serene Centre just beside Sugarhaus selling mainly bread loaves with donuts and sandwiches for dine-in.
Apart from it\'s focus on breads, The Bakery by Sourdough also boasts an extensive selection of hand brewed coffee such as the Nel\'s Drip ‚Äî single origin beans from Ethiopia that is brewed with a sock. The result is this filtered coffee that comes with a rather full body that is rather strong which carries a fruity flavour profile ‚Äî the ending notes do leave an aftertaste but it definitely works if you are looking for something to deliver the punch.
Newly opened in Serene Centre, the store occupies a small space, with hole-in-the wall vibes. Seating is all outdoors, so it\'s more of a take-away concept rather than an actual store. Really wanted to try this because it was HOMEMADE nut butter, and I can\'t resist anything slathered with nut butter. Also saw interesting items like Salted Chocolate Rye Cookies which I definitely will be back to try, as well as their naturally leavened donuts and sourdough bread. Despite looking simple, the humble toast was generously slathered in nut butter. The ratio of bread to nut butter was 1:1, I\'m not kidding! Expect to wait for about a few minutes for the friendly staff to make and serve you the food, as everything is prepared fresh upon order. I whipped out my computer to finish up some extra work, and when the staff served me my warm toast he actually asked me whether I needed the Wifi Password and filled me a glass of water. I think Singapore\'s cafe scene is truly expanding, and options are simply endless. For me - service is definitely one of my main deciding factors on whether I would go back to a cafe again. And Woodlands Sourdough has ticked all my good books in terms of service and good food! Best of all, it\'s so near school for me, that I can pop by anytime!

I admit that I‚Äôm a slut for Cheese. ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />Synonymous for their signature Sourdough Toast with various toppings, but if you happen to chance upon their daily specials like the grilled cheese sandwich I had, it‚Äôd be a sin to pass it. \n<br />Cheese is one of those things that\'s always magic to me because not all organisms when left to rot/ferment, comes out even better. Like all things I love that are dying or better when aged be it songs, wine, charcuterie, beef, cheese and etc üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #thebakerybywoodlandssourdough #sourdough #toast #grilledcheesesandwich #grilled #cheese #sandwich #grilledcheese #cheesesandwich #brunch

The perfect meal, or the best meals, occur in a context that frequently has very little to do with the food itself (at times). ü•ñ\n<br />.\n<br />It\'s always about the people, the company &amp; the experience but most importantly, the people. Get to know Chalith &amp; Nuri, the friendly Husband-&amp;-Wife duo that serves one of the Best Sourdough in town @woodlandssd . Read it at \"Inside Scoop\" on @burpple , where stories of the owners &amp; chef\'s where told, the unsung heroes basically. üññüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #woodlandssourdough #sourdough #nutbutter #honey #sage #creamcheese #berry #toast #sugarcakepie
Nut butter, honey and salt.
Not for everyone but I Guess you Brits will dig this. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />No doubt the Egg Salad Toast was the one I preferred, pickled onions contrast the herby devil-ish egg that\'s salty, with spice &amp; everything nice. üññüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #woodlandssourdough #sourdough #vegemite #cheese #eggsalad
Tried the banana walnut date tea cake, good that it\'s not sweet but too dry for my liking. It\'s not at Woodlands but at Serene Centre. -
The tanginess of the berry compote cuts through the creaminess of the sage infused cream cheese perfectly. One can\'t help but wonder why this combination has not been done more often.
The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough is an artisan bakery which specialises in sourdough bread. Their freshly made loaves are apparently sold out daily so be sure to come early!

Everything is just magical each time I\'m there and it\'s no surprise when I tried the Egg Salad with Dukkah and Pickled Onions ($5) on toast for the first time yesterday. Thick and hearty portions of egg salad spiced with some dukkah (an Egyptian spice) on the top. The pickled onions was an excellent touch to balance the flavours with some acidity.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough\n<br />Address: 10, Jalan Serene, Serene Centre, Unit 01-05, Singapore 258748\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #naturaleavened
This is so so so good! As a big fan of bread, and especially sourdough. This is amazing. Crispy sourdough bread mixed with savoury cream cheese and sweetness of the berry compote. Omggggg, I\'m missing this already! Will definitely be back for more üòç\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Have a great Vesak Day holiday!

Their creamy Nut Butter is what I wish I could have on my toast every single morning (tbh I don\'t know since when I get addicted to peanut butter). With the addition of honey and sea salt, the flavour was well-balanced and it was such a perfect complement for the toast.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #dessert #food #bread #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat
Come every week for the bread
Surprisingly the best thing we had here was the brownie, so moist, not overly sweet, with big chunk of nuts.

There is too much nut butter, said no one ever.
Favorite!!!!!
Learning my mistake for not reserving a pizza during my previous visit, this time round, reservations were made much earlier and we managed to get one of their limited supply of pizzas. Presenting to you their Bianca ($18), a thin crust pizza with parmigiano reggiano, buffalo mozzarella, fresh garlic and fresh basil. The finishing touch of EVOO, cracked black pepper and sea salt completes this wheel of enjoyment.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough\n<br />Address: 10, Jalan Serene, Serene Centre, Unit 01-05, Singapore 258748\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #woodlandssd #naturallyleavened

Everything on this toast works with the sprinkle of herb spices and drizzle of EVOO. Perhaps a dash of paprika will elevate it further? Go there early to avoid disappointment as most of the breads runs out quite quickly!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough\n<br />Address: 10, Jalan Serene, Serene Centre, Unit 01-05, Singapore 258748\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #woodlandssd #naturallyleavened
The one thing that blew me away was the Nut Butter, Honey and Sea Salt on Sourdough Toast ($3.50), An excellence combination of nuttiness and sweetness. The crispy sourdough toast makes a perfect base while the added touch of sea salt brings out the flavours even further.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The Bakery by Woodlands Sourdough\n<br />Address: 10, Jalan Serene, Serene Centre, Unit 01-05, Singapore 258748\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #woodlandssd #naturallyleavened

Pair it with a Kalita brew made with @catacoffee single origin beans, and you\'re all set for a serene afternoon. P.S. Had a chat with one of the owners @chalith earlier today.
