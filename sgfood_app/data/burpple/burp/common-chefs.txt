.\n<br />Travelled to Sembawang for this crisp, golden brown goodies.\n<br />.\n<br />Good earthy potato flavour, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and a little white truffle oil.\n<br />.\n<br />We paired it with the white truffle mayonnaise and chili, shiok.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Common Chefs\n<br />More details on blog
Crispy, truffle tater tots ($8) which come with a sprinkling of Parmesan and side sauces of addictive truffle mayo and sweet chilli that\'s actually spicy. The whole combination is fab. Throwback to our Sembawang-stretch hop.\n<br />💫\n<br />On the other hand, the coffee pulled is quite light. Nothing to scream about, as with the other offerings we tried of Wazzle.
What we have going on here is smoky paprika prawns layered on mesclun salad topped with tomato concasse that is heavy with Common Chefs\' special Mexican mayonaise and topped with black raisins. Wrapped in a wheat tortilla with a wedge of lime squeezed over the top . That\'s not all, it also comes with house corn tortilla chips on the side.\n<br />.\n<br />Grilled prawns taco at S$12 (New on menu!)\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine? \n<br />Common Chefs Cafe\n<br />8 Jalan Legundi, #01-13, 759274\n<br />.\n<br />#commonchefscafe #tacotuesday #🌮#taco #sgcafe#foodgemsg
Another new creation from @commonchefscafe , choose from 3 different choices - full breakfast, okonomiyaki and go green (vegetarian). The okonomoyaki (featured here) might not appear as photogenic as compared to the full breakfast (with a sunny side up atop) but the flavours and palatability were definitely on point! (Esp for fans of this Japanese savoury pancake🥞).A savoury buttermilk waffle topped with tuna flakes, fried tamago (a pan fried omelette), topped with tonkatsu sauce, Japanese mayo and bonito flakes. The waffles was thick, crisp with a soft and fluffy interior. Surprisingly a great combination to the other savoury elements with the batter having a salty savoury note instead of the usual sweet kind that\'s paired with ice cream. The tuna flakes had a characteristic fishy flavour that\'s actually real leggit tuna fish minced to pieces and not the dried flakes! Coupled with a thin but huge layer of fried omelette topped with a smoky, BBQ-alike tonkatsu sauce and creamy mayonnaise, the bonito flakes also added a pleasant umami note. A fusion of jap, Italian and western cuisine that was a perfect harmonious combination for my palate😋 Whats more, the pocket-friendly and NETT pricing here is yet another excuse for me to revisit this cafe, despite the long journey (for me) .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Along with cheddar cheese sauce, I would personally prefer having the burger in silo without this extra condiment that had no significant impact to the flavours. The cheddar cheese sauce was akin to a diluted nacho cheese, a thinner texture with a subtle smoky aftertaste. The chorizo patty could be a tad salty for some (as warned by the staff) which indeed was pretty overwhelming for me. Fortunately, the saltiness was offset by the other elements that made up the burger. The scrambled eggs were fluffy with a mild truffle aroma whereas the sautéed mushrooms added a pleasant earthy note. Last but not least, caramelised onions added a slight crunch and sweetness that was a good counter balance to the chorizo patty. Tater tots were done to an ideal crispness, where what\'s lacking (for me) was just the addition of truffle and that super additive truffle mayo for dipping these bite sized goodness! 💖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
📍Common Chefs ($8 - Small)\n<br />Need I explain further why this is an amazing dish? NOPE. Firstly, I\'m a tater tots lover. Secondly, I love all things truffle. Lastly, joining both of these together is simply amazing. These little pockets of happiness will burst with flavor in your mouth &amp; you\'ll be so happy you travelled to sembawang for it!! 😌👍🏼
🌮 How about a Grilled Prawns Taco (S$12 Nett) from @CommonChefsCafe (near Sembawang Shopping Centre)?\n<br />.\n<br />Here, a soft wheat tortilla is served with crunchy smoked paprika prawns, mesclun salad, chopped tomatoes, black raisins and a house special spicy Mexican Mayonnaise with hard tortilla chips at the side.\n<br />.\n<br />The flavours are on point with a good mix of sweet, tangy, savoury and spicy. Even though I\'m usually very adverse to raisins, I do understand why they chose to add raisins here- for a tint of sweetness. But the next time I order, I may still omit the raisins.\n<br />.\n<br />If you are lunching in the North, pop over and try! If taco is not your thing, there are other Mains too. Their tater tots are also good!\n<br />.\n<br />Where to find this?\n<br />Common Chefs\n<br />8 Japan Legundi L1-13, S759274\n<br />.\n<br />This was taken during a food tasting.
Baked chorizo with sautéed mushrooms, spinach, tomato salsa, hints of melted cheese, and topped with a beautiful egg yolk which was so professionally done, not too watery yet soft enough to spread over the mash of food. The mixture was rich and satisfying. It looks very red but, trust me, the tomato wasn\'t overpowering. The sliced brioche toast was very well done and it complements the gravy too! Worth the $12.50 and I\'ll be back to try the other items on the menu.
served with a side of their popular truffle tater tots. to send your breakfast into breast mode, pour melted cheddar cheese
too #gamestrong.\n<br />Craving for Okonomiyaki Wazza (S$11), which is one of the new items as part of the revamped menu 🙃\n<br />A Japanese-Western fusion where @commonchefscafe uses buttermilk waffle as a base and flourished with carious toppings such as tuna flakes and tamago, glazed with Tonkatsu sauce and Japanese mayo and finally topped with bonito flakes and seaweed! \n<br />Savoury pancake..comfort food at its best ❤️
Mozzarella, tuna flakes, fried egg atop basic buttermilk waffles, heaped on Tonkatsu sauce, Japanese mayo, bonito flakes and shredded nori, it resembles an Okonomiyaki. Each bite provides a forkful of flavour. Plus did you spot the Rich Man Burger ($16)?

My waffle fix is fulfilled with Okonomiyaki Wazza (pizza + waffles) [$11]. It is topped with all things Japanese on a waffle.

A hidden gem within Sembawang. Serving western fares at reasonable prices, beautifully crafted dessert and freshly brewed coffee make it worthwhile to head up North to visit them.
At this 6months-old cafe, you can find affordably priced food that is yummy! Double Cheese Beef Burger ($16), the Boss Fosh Burger ($17), Duroc Porkchop ($18) and Shepherd\'s Pie ($15). Oh! And their matcha latte ($5) is the jasmine greentea type, refreshing!\n<br />.\n<br />Prices are nett. No gst/service charge.

Double beef patty cooked to medium that is packed with juices, complemented with bacon, egg, sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onions in between soft toasted buttered brioche buns. No wonder it is my favourite, because this caters for the carnivore lovers 🙃\n<br />Oh and for non-beef lovers, you can either choose Chicken ($18) or Fish ($17)!\n<br />Thank you @commonchefscafe and @nichology for the good lobang, esp when it is pretty near to my house 🤤
Serving western fares at reasonable prices, beautifully crafted dessert and freshly brewed coffee make it worthwhile to head up North to visit them.\n<br />•\n<br />Soul Food ($12) was one deceptively simple yet delicious dish we had. Crispy chicken coated in Asian spices along with waffles and maple syrup, this tender chicken was packed with flavours. Not to be missed is their Truffle Tatter Tots ($8 for small). Deep fried potatoes tossed with premium Italian truffle oil served with truffle mayo dip, we just can\'t stop popping these addictive tots!\n<br />•\n<br />Thanks @commonchefscafe @nichology for the invite and @snapandeatsg for bringing me along.\n<br />•\n<br />Common Chefs Cafe\n<br />Address: 8 Jalan Legundi, Unit 01-13, Singapore 759274\n<br />#commonchefssg
Chicken steak with potato (tossed with garlic thyme) and seasonal salad. 
This Jewel right here is actually a chocolate moose cake within 😉
So pretty, it was hard to destroy it. However, we did 🙊 It looks good and taste good as well - this Orange Chocolate Tart with Earl grey Mousse ($7.90). For Matcha lover, I heard there\'s a matcha version of this too soon! (Check out the location tag!).
Interesting Asia Five Spiced batter Fried Chicken with a little Filipino inspiration - seriously tasty and tender chicken paired with the fluffiest waffles. The waffles were even flavourful without the butter and maple syrup. This is easily one of the table\'s favourite.
@commonchefscafe really goes all out as this monster is packed with double meat patty, sunny side up egg, topped up with mushrooms, caramelised onions with insane amount of bacon and covered with melted cheese all over!  One sinful treat meant for Friday and best of all setting you back only at $17 NETT! \n<br />This was a hosted tasting courtesy of @commonchefscafe and @nichology! Thanks Ma @ksherena for extending the invite 🙆🏻
I\'m missing the food and the cup of matcha already🤤The matcha here taste different from what you have tasted😉If you like Green Thai milk tea, you\'ll love the matcha here!

Meeting mum after she is done with work but arrived a little too early so decided to travel a little further off to get my dose of coffee.
😊)\n<br />And if you\'re still wondering how to start on this monstrous masterpiece, I\'d suggest you to just \"anyhow whack la\" and don\'t forget to lick up the meaty grease trickling down your fingers afterward 😉💕\n<br />•\n<br />Anyway, all that\'s missing now is a bottle of chilled soda 🍾
I have only heard if one place so far that used to serve waffles with chocolate chips incorporated into the waffle batter itself, and this is the second one I have came across. The waffle is probably one of the better ones I have ever came across — the buttermilk aroma pretty evident and was a little crisp and fluffy with chocolate chips that are melted within the batter for a little chewiness and chocolatey flavour. Opt for the maple syrup as a sauce so the flavours of the chocolate chips and waffle shine through within getting overpowered by heavy tasting sauces. Ice-cream flavours here are regularly rotated around with a board indicating the flavours available — the Creme Brûlée comes with a little crackling sugar while being mildly sweet; quite appetising if you are looking for a lighter flavour to pair with the waffle.
•\n<br />P/s: This is simply too much; someone needs to tie my hands; I can\'t stop myselffff; MUST HAVE more rinnnngggggs onomnomnom 🙆🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♂️
It was just so GOOOOOOOD. PERIOD.\n<br />•\n<br />One of the best waffles to date; crispy on the outside with such a gorgeous cakey interior! YUMS!! ❤️\n<br />•\n<br />Couldn\'t have finished it without the help of @gninethree and @lionelchen89 🤗💕! Thanks for the awesome lunchhhhh 😆🍴
Regret to try this cake. It cost me $7.00, normal bakery cake shop also better than this. The cream super oily like I am eating butter. We not enjoy the meal as we feel that the chef no heart to prepare the best food to serve us.
Came here just for desserts - Chocolate Chip Waffles with Cappuccino Ice Cream, Salted Caramel Ice Cream and maple sauce 😁
At $4, but also the most petite sized cheesecake I have ever seen that was almost of the same size as the dessert fork they serve. Apart from the size, this was decent; smooth cream cheese mousse that\'s decadently cheesy like the classic New York Cheese Cake topped with a layer of crackling sugar on the top. Only gripe was the crumble base at the bottom — seemingly lacked texture as it bore the same consistency as the cake layer itself; would have preferred a little more bite/crunch along with it.
Apart from being a tad too milky, the coffee here was not too bad, with an earthy and nutty flavour profile.
Ordered waffle n salted caramel ice cream. Waffle was good, crispy n fluffy. Very disappointed by the ice cream. either the fridge was faulty or the ice cream wasnt ready. it melted really fast and tasted icey. 
🤤 Look at that waffle and sunny side up 😋
Apple crumble with a scoop of ice cream 😍 Best thing ever.
Major love for this because it comes with Sunny side up and Nachos sauce! 😱🤤
Big, juicy and fresh. Aglio Olio isn\'t too oily for me. Spicy level was just nice for me but that\'s usually subjective. 🤗
Got me loving it to the last bite.

Cheers to the new menu at Common Chefs Cafe. Now, you can have the best of both worlds with WAZZA (Waffles &amp; Pizza). There are 3 Wazzas to choose from! Full Breakfast, Okonomiyaki or Go Green. I was contemplating between Full Breakfast or Okonomiyaki and decided on the former. The buttermilk waffle has a nice and crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy on the inside. What\'s hidden under the egg? Savoury toppings like bacon, mozzarella, mushrooms, tomatoes😋. And not forgetting the egg with a perfectly runny yolk 🍳😍. It\'s a stone walk from Sembawang Shopping Centre and famous Sembawang white bee hoon. .\n<br />Full Breakfast Wazza at S$12 .\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine? \n<br />Common Chefs Cafe\n<br />8 Jalan Legundi, #01-13, 759274\n<br />.\n<br />#commonchefscafe #waffles #pizza #eggporn #sgcafe#foodgemsg

~\n<br />Say Wazza! Yes you read that right! Its a cross between a Buttermilk Waffle &amp; a Pizza. The Full Breakfast Wazza ($12) gets you a Buttermilk Waffle top with the usual Pizza offerings such as Mushrooms, Tomatos, Bacon, Mozzarella Cheese &amp; a Runny Egg hence its Full Breakfast name!

The Truffle Tots $8 is really nice, with the strong truffle flavor, the chicken waffle ($12)could be crispier it would be better, the chicken Chop is really nice well seasoned and well grilled, the platter C($12.50) is not too bad it is quite flavourful, but good for sharing instead. The shepherd pie ($15) is another dish for sharing as well.. \n<br />Plus point: No GST and No Service Charge
A different kind of chicken waffle from the rest. \n<br />Come get your soul filled with some soul food.

Beautifully plated Charcoal Waffle...and it tasted as good as it looks!
Beef burger served at its best when ingredients are freshly prepared. 
Yummy 5👍
🍔🍟 happy weekend everyone! #CommonChefsSg
The creamy taste of the creme brulee was adequate and was sweet enough, that comes topped with a water stick, and sprinkled with cornflakes and mini marshmellows.
Must try!
Oh yes and @exasperatedmilk says that the coffee is legit too.

Beef burger featuring a \"fiery Asian Sambal sauce\", caramalised onions and jalapeños and melted cheese in between buttered brioche bun. Quite decently done, and liked how the beef is done to medium-rare with a pinkish interior and juices all locked in. The Sambal delivers what it promises with a moderate level of spiciness, though the entire burger gets a little too salty at the end from the Sambal. Comes with truffle fries (fries drizzled in truffle oil) by the side which comes with a considerable truffle flavour.
Though was kinda skeptical after the first waffle... But still gave the second waffle a chance. Waffles were not too bad, but ice cream needs to improve. (The first time the waffles came, my ice cream already melted, this photo is the second waffle). #burpple #pepperminterfoodadventure #cafehopping #commonchefs #sembawangcafe #charcoalwaffles
