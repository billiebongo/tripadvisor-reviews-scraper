These are the best fish fingers I\'ve eaten so far coz they\'re super crunchy, aren\'t overpriced for the size and number you get and they\'ve drained the oil so well without losing the juiciness of the fish.
A big fluffy pancake topped with berries and sweet cream on the side. Choose between different fruit toppings.
A little cuppa after a long day and walk around the museum. Waiting for a little time to pass while I rest my little feet &amp; wait for the event to begin.
Savoury, crisp and sweet. Mixed with the buttery cream and zesty sweet syrup. $9 for a plate of 2 plain pancakes.

Quiet and romantic dinner with consistently good food!
This is very good seriously! Love the nice sweetness to it and the cream doesn\'t feel greasy! \n<br />#burpple #ffthought #nationalmuseumsg #pancakes #banana #walnut #gulamelaka #vanillalattecream #cafesg
@oftokyonparis is having this. I going to watch see how he going to finish this! Lol\n<br />#burpple #ffthought #fullworks #sunnysideupeggs #bacon #brioche #mushroom #hashbrown #nationalmuseumsg #cafesg
Very simple scrambled eggs, brioche, bacon and their caramel kaya! The eggs are nicely done and not too milky tasted. The bacon can be slightly more well done and the brioche is good. But love the kaya most! Got the not too watery texture and slight gritty feel! \n<br />#burpple #ffthought #nationalmuseumsg #basicworks #scrambledeggs #bacon #brioche #kayafood

Salted Caramel Coconut Pancakes! The pancake here used to be much better! But this time is dried and lack of flavour. Quite sad though.. I just lost one places for awesome pancakes! :( #sgig #igsg #instasg #instagramsg #nofilter #singapore #food #foodpics #foodporn #foodies #brunch #pancake
