Oh this was satisfying for the sweet tooth! A slab of chocolate ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate cookies. How does that not sound good? 
Head down to PasarBella where you\'ll find many interesting stalls selling artisan kitchenware as well as a whole variety of food ranging from your usual cafe picks to delicious pork knuckle! We grabbed the cold brew from Dutch Colony ($6.5) during our mid-break and tried out the adorable Macarons ($4.5) from Bonheur Patisserie. They were really cute but a tad sweet. 
Ma Jie Indugence from The Quarters. Looks a bit plain.
Healthy version of peanut butter by Second Helpings.
Want some crispy fish skin for snacks?
Salted Caramel Tiramisu from Provi5ion. Best have it within an hour.
Popout stall. A Dutch street snack.
Fermoy Estate\'s wines are good enough for those on a budget.
Go high on protein and skip the carbo. Pay $15 for the per serving combo.
Only $13.50, you can have a filling meal instead of forking out loads more for a mere small pan at those \"tapas\" restaurants.
Seriously good food on a Saturday afternoon! Good start to my weekend after a horrible week. 
Classic American Grilled Cheese Sandwiches. Slightly pricey but it sure is finger licking gooood. They have a new item - the Grilled Cheese Chicken Waffle. Now that, sounds amazing. 
Tasted like frozen lobster. Not liking the sesame bun, but it makes a good Instagram worthy photo anyways. 
$4-$4.50 per piece. Gift from a friend. Can\'t bear to have the first bite! 
üç£ Just witnessed the Northern Bluefin Tuna Cutting live, freshly imported yesterday from Tsukiji Market, Tokyo. Ah so freshhhh üòç And here\'s the huge Boston lobster. #OceansofSeafood

Le Cordon Bleu will be doing cooking demonstrations throughout the day, preparing food inspired by the new movie by ‚ÄòThe Hundred-Foot Journey‚Äô. You can try free samples of the dishes whipped up at the demos. I\'ll definitely catch the movie when it opens in cinemas on 28 August 2014! You should too! #100footjourney bit.ly/HundredFootJourneySG
Sushi platter for dinner at the oceans of seafood. Hidden right at the end of PasarBella! Perfect snack to end the day, happy Friday everyone.
Ended up with a meal TOTALLY non vegan when the 8 of us split up to buy meals to share. So #onthetable last night: #porkknuckle, roast beef, roast chicken, roast lamb, pulled pork, deep fried clamari with plaintain, yam and sweet potato chips, bangers and mash, truffle mushroom pasta &amp; meatball pasta. Great fellowship staying till the lights went off followed by karaoke and more HTHT till 4am! Nights like these are indeed precious!
So I will be doing some spamming. \n<br />If you ask me is the seafood fresh, I would have to say I tasted fresher. Local seafood is always the best seafood. But not every one has the luxury to travel oversea to eat their local seafood. So we have to accept this level of freshness. \n<br />What a fierce looking lobster!

Had enough of exotic ice cream flavors? How about trying some ice cream sandwiches from \"The Ice cream &amp; cookie co\", an online delivery ice cream \"parlor\". Tried their strawberry shortcake (strawberry ice cream sandwiched by 2 egg-free cookies). And also another flavor \"After Eight\" (peppermint ice cream sandwiched by 2 brownies). I must say its taste is pretty matching, and handy as well. Great for parties or gatherings etc. 
$7.50/100g for the pork ribs (which I felt wasn\'t worth the $), and $6/$10 option for the roasted pork belly. Spent $20.40 for this plate I think. Pricey, but the pork belly seems to be one of the better ones I\'ve had. The fatty part melts in your mouth!
Very very nice! Fats melt in mouth!! $6 for 100gm though. 
My body is still in the office but my mind and tummy has wandered off thinking about dinner. Especially when I have some pretty heirloom tomatoes waiting for me at home. Wonder what I should have them with? How about roasted pork belly and soy dressing? Or just plain ol\' Caprese styled? Choices choices. | #heirloomtomato #food #dinner

The waffle was nice but the ice cream could be better! Try the waffle alone before ordering a scoop. Really loved their cutlery !
Straight from changi to grandstand. Just look at that chunk of crab roe! Must have been 400g of it we ended up leaving half of that behind...
Scheduled activities and mini performances throughout the day, in conjunction with the soft launch this weekend (4 - 5 May).
Since it\'s the weekend, decided to check out something new. Interesting concept, worth a visit even just for novelty\'s sake :) Some areas felt as though we\'re not even in Singapore - some resemblance to Pike Place Market or Tsukiji Fish Market.

My favourite part of PasarBella was The Cheese Ark. It\'s a little hidden but your nose should be able to find it beside Le Patio. Ending up buying 6 different kinds of cheeses after tasting and hearing so much from the extremely knowledgeable and friendly cheesemonger! 
I love this place! But it\'s not fully open yet!
.\n<br />Papito‚Äôs paella takes me back to the annual international fair of Lund where a queue would form for about 20 servings on a huge pan. The hawker would be mixing up the ingredients with the round rice, and the flavours of capsicum and herbs would waft slowly, filling the air with drool and anticipation.\n<br />.\n<br />Having earned the second place in the international paella competition in 2015, Papito‚Äôs serves up a mean and simple Spanish fare. The round and short paella rice soaks up the flavours of seafood stock, giving a burst of savoury and sour with the slice of lemon as garnish.\n<br />.\n<br />With generous chicken chunks, chorizo sausages, zucchini, capsicum, this takes the cut for simple Spanish fare, without a ticket to Europe. At $13.50, this dish is best enjoyed warm or when they are working up a new pan, the later serves can get a tad cold with the indoor air conditioning.\n<br />_______________\n<br />Le Patio / Papito\'s\n<br />Stall #27, Pasarbella @ The Grandstand, \n<br />200 Turf Club Road, Bukit Timah\n<br />Singapore 287994\n<br />.\n<br /> #eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #dojoeats #paella #spanishfood
Wow. This is so good! My first time trying burrata cheese which we bought from @thecheeseark and it‚Äôs so soft and cheesy without being pungent at all. üòç And because they didn‚Äôt have Parma ham, we tried the Serrano ham instead. Ooh wah~~ I think I‚Äôm a convert to this type of Jamon Serrano from Spain üá™üá∏. The salty combination together with the soft and melt-in-your-mouth burrata cheese and rocket salad is a harmonious delight. üòÉüòÉüòÉ

They are soooo good! The cracking pork is so crispy and not oily, while the honey pork is  fatty but not greasy! Heavenly when dripped in their apple sauce or mustard!
Brown ... Nutella flavor. 
Happiness in a box. From Papitos\' Paella &amp; More. 
Had pastas for dinner today over at Pasarbella üçù diagonally opposite Keith\'s crackling roast, is a open kitchen concept pasta stall. Ordered Wild Mushroom Truffle Cream penne while he had Bacon, mushroom &amp; sundried tomatoes spaghetti which was a little bit salty &amp; too oily! Had cute macaroons, Honey &amp; Nutella flavored after that. Commendable on the cute designs but Laduree definitely win hands down
Looks good and taste really awesome. Hidden gem indeed! #burpple #8DAYSEat #ketohloh
These cute little macaroons can light up your day just by looking at it! Many more characters such as hello kitty, cookie monster, minnie mouse and etc. However, the taste is not that good though. 
$3 for an oyster and they are damn fresh!
A tad too salty.

Pasar Bella is an indoor space with many stalls selling crepes, baked goods (there\'s Da Paolo), coffee (Dutch Colony Coffee), etc. There\'s also a grocery area selling fresh fruits. I guess this is the closest we get to a farmers\' market in Singapore! The food we tried was rather average, but I think the paella is worth trying. The rice was very flavourful, and it had a generous helping of seafood, chicken and capsicum. The paella is cooked in a humongous pan at intervals, and it seems to always sell out! We had to wait an hour plus for a new batch to be cooked. This was quite pricey though, about $13 for a small takeaway box full. If you haven\'t been to Pasar Bella, I\'d recommend visiting for the novelty :) Turf City is quite inaccessible, but there are shuttle buses to and from Botanic Gardens MRT and a few other locations.

Giant wok! Long wait if you actually miss it. Anyway, a box of paella is $13.50, and really good. You can really taste the stock infused into the rice after the slow-cooking process. 2 mussels, some chicken fish and a prawn. But yeah I\'d gladly finish the rice on its own!
