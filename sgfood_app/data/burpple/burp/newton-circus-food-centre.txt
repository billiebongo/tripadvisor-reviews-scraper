This is from kwee heng stall. The soup is marvellous. Very herbally taste which is good. The duck meat is tender and well roasted. I ordered the bigger bowl. Which is $5. Smaller portion is $4. Recommended. 
Array of seafood dishes to choose from, range of prices to suit to the quantity of eaters! 
Tonight ain\'t hazy so off for some hawker finds!! Beehoon goreng, satay, sambal stingray and sugarcane with lemon for dinner!! Simply yummy, simply shiok!! 
Ordered from different food stalls. We had spicy squid, chili crab, seafood fried rice, satay and water chestnut. üëçüèª
This is da bomb and you wouldn\'t want to miss! \n<br />Sheng Da BBQ Seafood is located at Newton Food Centre Stall No. 2. \n<br />In celebration of Singapore\'s 50th birthday, they are having a promotion for all my followers, simply flash this post to enjoy a $5 off with a minimum spending of $50 In a single receipt, one discount per table. This promotion is valid till 31st August 2015
Prices are at $4/$6/$8. For a stall in this food centre, this Fried Hokkien Mee ($4) came with a generous portion! The noodles by itself was quite underwhelming in terms of its taste despite soaking in the flavour of the broth. However, when mixed with the chilli, it provides a different rendition of the local dish which sacrifices the spiciness level with a soury combination which mixes quite well with the noodles and tasted nice! 
Duck platter for 2 consists of duck meat, toufu, toupok, bean sprouts, egg, peanuts, pickles and the unusual pigskin! The rice is fragrantly sauced and the soup is the herbal type. Well paired with fresh orange juice from the stall next to this. The platter set is going at $12. 
The great thing about staying in Singapore is always our hawker food. You get to eat the barbecue stingray, cockles, satay and chicken wings while slurping down a glass of sugarcane or coconut juice.
Prices are at $4/$5/$6/$8. This Fried Hokkien Mee ($4) is fried longer than usual to let the broth be absorbed by the  noodles. The results are great tasting slurpy noodles that is flavourful. However, the prawns feels like it is a late addition to the cooking.
I can\'t remember the name of store but it\'s in front of the car park. 
$5 for the Fish Soup, $0.50 for the extra bowl of rice, you do the math. do you know that teochew style for fish porridge will serve rice separately (or pour the cooked rice into the soup after the soup is done) whereas the hokkiens will cook the rice together with the meat to achieve the \"nua-nua\"/\"ÁàõÁàõ\"congee form? #whati8today #burpple #8DAYSEat #fishcongee #fishsoup #chinesefood #chinese
Not for the faint-hearted. Some are too bloody that I can\'t bring myself into eating them. But I have some friends who love them the way they are. In a bloody hot mess. üòÇ
Every pieces of chicken are well coated with the creamy salted egg yolk sauce, and it\'s still able to remain its crispiness exterior. The sauce is so creamy yet you don\'t feel greasy eating it.. So so good! \n<br />Sheng Da BBQ Seafood is located at Newton Food Centre Stall No. 2.
Who is back after one year omg. And her boyfriend haha. And @beaverwoo and Kaitlin üôÖüôÜüôÖüôÜ #sgfood #yum #fatdieme
Almost every stalls serve the best and fresh seafood. Apart from seafood, you can also have your Indian bee hoon goreng, the Malay satay and the Chinese fish soup. And of course we had our simple and basic meal of the day which is Halal certified from stall 19! The best thing about this food centre is no one will force you to sit and settle for anything you do not like. You are indeed free to decide and settle for what you\'d like to eat! Come on over to 500 Clemenceau Avenue North, #01-19 Newton Circus Food Centre, Singapore 229495
Seriously I couldn\'t tell you which stall this 7000000-calorie styrofoam plate of char kueh came from except that it can be found in Newton Circus food centre because my mom ordered this but this plate really impressed me at a place (much hyped about) like this. Cheap and good, keeping it real for food üëç
This is what happens when your dinner can\'t fill that big space in the stomach 
So spoilt for choices at Newton Food Centre, but the BBQ stingray at store 11  (Hai Yan BBQ Seafood) is good enough to make me smile.
He shouts and yells and cusses, but that doesn\'t mean he isn\'t incredibly sweet, too. I was standing in front of him, separated only by security guards, so I called out to him to take a photo with me. He asked security THREE times to let me through. He continued taking photos with a few other lucky people, then turned back to me and asked if I was happy with the shot. He is one amazing, amazing man. 
A dessert that has grown up with me theough the years. Which Singaporean doesnt know what Ice Kachang is??
Deliciousa !

Actually not true. I enjoy hawker food.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />I admit I am a little tired of fried foods, salted eggyolk this or that etc. These days, I like simple foods. So today\'s lunch is my favorite, braised duck rice. With extra condiments like taukwa and egg. Much love for the thick gooey sauce so generously splashed over the tender meat. If only you could see the thick sauce drizzled and dripping on my rice... it is so sexy (in a good way). This is one prerequisite of a braised duck sauce. Not only does it need to look silky smooth, shines, it has to be of the right consistency and one\'s tastebuds must be tempted enough to drool.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Whilst it is not the best duck rice, it pretty much settled my \"lust\" for braised duck rice. Lol.... a little humor there. So lame! A nice lunch made complete by table service by a very friendly uncle from the stall.
üòç
Part of their menu and prices
‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Seafood beehoon with prawns and clams. Beehoon had the right level of soft consistency. Broth that was brewed for many hours had a little sweetness. The cooking time took awhile. Can see why as the beehoon soaked up the broth resulting in white to beigy. However, I prefer it with less sodium to enjoy the umaminess of the broth.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />This plate costs $7.80 which comprises of 3 prawns and 5 clams. Extra clams at a cost of $2. Generous amount of beehoon which by the way is too much for me. There is also lobster seafood beehoon at $26. A trend recently. Kudos to the young owner who left his teaching job to start a stall in the hawker centre.
Meatball is handmade but a tad dry. The other porkball (on the left) was tastier as it is non fried and within the ball is a pork filling. Somehow I find the noodles sweet .....\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />I eat what I like. I post what I like.

Generous amounts of egg with the delicious carrot cake in the sweet black sauce, makes one salivate just thinking about it.
It looks promising but the chilli could\'ve been better. That\'s the punch that\'s lacking.
Have always been a fan of BCM and this XO version was a hit. The noodles were nice and \"Q\" and underneath it was an awesome XO chilli sauce. Added $2 for 3 of those handmade fried meatballs that were good too. Certainly a satisfying bowl of our local delight. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #bcm

Back to makan in our local food court. I must admit I have a soft spot for good prawn noodles, especially one with that rich crustaceans prawn head soup. \n<br />This Traditional Prawn Noodles served quite a good one, although not that super rich like that of Whitley\'s yet. And it\'s not those with the giant tiger prawns. \n<br />Its clearer yet flavourful soup was enjoyable, especially with a dash of chilli powder and a few small cut chilli padi for the extra punch. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #prawnmee
Maybe abit too much for some people though so will be good to ask for less if you don\'t want something so heavy. The meatballs are pretty okay, not the best but yeah. Overall a reasonably priced meal considering its in the most touristy hawker centre. \n<br />#hawkersg #sghawker #sghawkers #hawkerfoodsg #hawkerhopping#jiaklocal#hawkertoday#sgfoodies#sgfood #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemakers #eatoutsg #eatbooksg #foodgasmsg #foodpornsg #foodstagramsg #foreverhungry #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #openricesg #sgfoodiary #singaporeinsiders #tslmakan
Grilled with garlic and butter was the recommended cooking method to taste their fresh meat at its best. Indeed, biting into those big chunks of meat was of much satisfaction. No.23 Takara Grill.\n<br />Dining at Newton Food Centre now was a much more enjoyable experience after its revamp. Cleaner and much better ventilated; although making choices between the many stalls of repeated food could be a chore. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #bbqgrill #tigerprawns #jiaklocal

Fresh and juicy!
Super yum
At $0.60 a stick, you get one out of 2 finger foods that this food centre is popular for - satay! These 20 sticks ($12, 10 chicken &amp; 10 pork) comes with succulent pieces of fatty meat that are barbecued to perfection! The satay sauce was equally as good, I finished it all up!
