Grandma\'s Secret Chilli Crab recipe with Fettuccine. At $16 this felt a little overpriced for what you get in return. No doubt it\'s chili crab, but I do wish that it came with a little more meat to justify the price. Fettuccine felt that it could do better with a little more cooking time, and although the chili crab was sauce was decently spicy, it tasted seemingly dull lacking in the flavours of fresh crustacean. The jiggly poached egg releases an explosive burst when poked on, but seemed to have a missing link to the pasta in terms of flavour. Perhaps a more refined execution would help in improving this dish.
Ice cream pops with choose your own topping is fabulous.  Really yummy!!! I got mine with waffles,  however the waffles were rubbery and not actually cooked through. So disappointed :( Will try again in the future even just for ice cream! ...\n<br />...\n<br />...\n<br />#sg #singapore #singaporefood #singaporedessert #burpple #burpplesg #burpplebestofjurong #igsg #igsgfood #perthfoodieinsingapore #instadessert #instafoodsg #instadessertsg #dessert #dessertporn #foodpornsg #foodinjurong #igfood #sgdessert #sgfooddiary #wheretoeatinsg #wheretoeatsg #sgigfoodies #exploresg #exploresingapore #thisissingapore #eatoutsg #poppypops #jem #jemjurong
This cafe is definitely a very nice place to chill at with really nice sunset scenery üåÖ
And their waffle is indeed not bad. Flavours for mini popsicles are not as extensive as the normal ones, but we opted it so each of us can have one. Well, they gave waffle &amp; icecream a new form. Waffles need not be eaten with softserve only. With popsicles will do too. Would love to see better flavours like earlgrey lavender perhaps.\n<br />.\n<br />#poppypopsg #waffle #icecream #popsicles #desserts
Love the interior and the hand-drawn wall, especially in daylight. If only the food is as nice though. For set lunch, u get a choice of one main, a tea and a mini popsicle at $10nett. Although it\'s value for money, i feel the food is disappointing. I would come back for the popsicles with waffles next time. Their salted caramel and salted honey popsicle is not bad but i\'m not sure if it will be enough to sustain.\n<br />.\n<br />#poppypops #jem #jurong #brunch #lunch #onthetable

ü¶Ä The sauce is quite spicy and tasted just like chilli crab but too little for the amount of fries. More sauce is available at additional $1. They also serve mentaiko and truffle fries. \n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #cafehop #sgcafe #instatravel #onthetable #foodporn #foodgasm #instagood #instafood #photography #photooftheday #travel #travelgram #bbctravel  #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfoodie #explore #fries #jiaklocal #sgcafehop #whati8today #sgfood #8dayseat #mentaiko #chillicrab #trufflefries #wanderlust

So cooling good! üòÑ
Recently I\'m in love with chilli again... üòÜ
Definitely going back for more. -M
Actually tastes like cheesecake!
üç≠üç≠\n<br />In between destinations, I decided to explore Jurong East. I googled and found this lovely place to have something sweet. Situated on the rooftop of JEM, it has wonderful natural lighting, quiet and a nice cafe to chill and take photos. üç≠üç≠\n<br />Many flavors of gelato on sticks. This is coconut almond ($4.80 including toppings). For toppings I chose a drizzling of dark chocolate and a sprinkling of almond bits. The gelato was not overly sweet and not too coconutty. I liked the crunchy almond slices that were imbedded in the gelato. Not too creamy like softserve...kinda in between a softserve and a sorbet. This was really refreshing.\n<br />üç≠üç≠\n<br />Looking simple &amp; spectacular without over the top dressings. \n<br />#gelato #icecreamsticks #i8mondays #8dayseat #dessertlovers #dessert #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #burpplemessyeats #burpplesg #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #narratrs #singaporeeats #singaporeinsiders #discoversg #poppypops
