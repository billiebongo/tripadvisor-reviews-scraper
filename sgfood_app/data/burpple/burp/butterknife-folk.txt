French inspired bakes and gelato. This petite beauty is \"Slicky Finger\" which is sponge fingers with a passionfruit curd and coconut cream. Topped with fresh pineapples, dragonfruit and lingonberry.\n<br />ðŸ”¹\n<br />Sponge is so light, fluffy with a refreshing tangyness from the curd; balanced off by the sweet pineapples. The bottom is soaked in alittle rum to give the sponge a moisture lift. Nice to know that all bakes and gelato are made inhouse.\n<br />ðŸ”¹\n<br />For opening promo, from now till Sep 3... all items are 15% off. Don\'t say I bojio. Other cakes available are \"Frasier\" which is strawberry shortcake in french, a deconstructed mont blanc etc. Thank you, Ingrid @butterknifefolk for your warm hospitality and introducing everything in the cafe.
