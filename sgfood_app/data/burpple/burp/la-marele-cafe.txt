Pasta aglio olio for $12.90, pretty big portion but probably won\'t come back, $13.90 for all day brunch, probably more worth it. Coffee wasn\'t fantastic but the ambience is pretty sweet. 
Cakes sold here are amazing! They sell a variety of cakes, and everyday, it\'s different flavours and types of cakes. Even though it is a little overpriced (a slice of cake can come up to $9), this cafe is a must go! Their interior is different from any other cafes, where it is nicely furnished and designed. I\'ll rate the cakes there 4/5! 
This croissant came stuffed with honey baked ham, a very flavorful cheese sauce and roquettes. $16.90 w/o GST.
Croissant came stacked with ham, sautéed mushrooms and bechamel sauce. The side potatoes were nicely seasoned but the nacho chips would\'ve been great if there was a dip. $15.90 not inclusive of GST. 
Cappuccino at $6.00 without latte art. Taste nice especially in the cosy environment. Good place for friends gathering or chat. No service charge except GST. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 
Very unique environment and wall painting. Delicious a L\'ail et Olio. Spaghetti with garlic, chilly and turkey bacon maybe the olio is slightly more which kinda make it oily. $14.90 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
One of the signature dish; include turkey bacon, grilled chipolata sausage, scramble eggs, grilled tomatoes, butter croissant and baked beans. Very delicious and nicely done individually. $18.90 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Tropical Sunset served in hot. Green tea with assorted fruits; lychees &amp; kiwi. Good combination that make the tea taste sweet and mild sour, yet it doesn\'t cover the taste of green tea. $9.90 per pot. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Big team meeting at La Marelle over at Baghdad Street where I had a delish pasta (can\'t recall which now!) and a slice of the Hazelnut Buttercream cake which was just ok for me. 
I love the concept of being in a magical place. I just wished that the food and service was also magical. 
$8.20 each\n<br />Pretty decorations, lively music &amp; not too loud, free WiFi, not suitable for quiet study. Good for a 4 people group hangout. It\'s halal.
Croissant is crispy, a little too crispy in fact. 
Not a fan of rainbow cakes, but this is a win! And may I have those plates pretty please? *batting eyelashes*
Everything looks pretty but we decided on the mud cheesecake and hazelnut chocolate cake. Mud cheesecake tastes like an Oreo cheesecake but the hazelnut cake was absolutely gorgeous. Warm chocolate sauce and moist spongy layers of chocolate cake... Heaven💕
Crossaints are fully stuffed, buttery, flaky and delicious my warm! Something you\'ll hardly find in Singapore. Recommend: Ohlala and Le Fat Duck💕
Food is good. Amount of sauce is just right. Not bland at all!
I was in for a melting moment, tastes sooo gooood! Not too sweet, cheesecake is light and creamy, melts in the mouth, and tastes just like vanilla ice-cream! Would drop by this place again to try the other cakes! Abt $8+ per slice though! But worth the try!
Pretty good pasta, accompanied with the iced chocolate and blanche mocktail. Worth the price! Didn\'t try the desserts, gave a reason to come back!
Comes with nachos and salsa sauce, portion\'s just nice. Good ambience, food variety is limited. Speciality about this cafe? It\'s a halal cafe :)
A cafe in the heart of Baghdad Street 🍵(Green Tea Latte)
$7.50 for a piece of cake is way too pricey. \n<br />It\'s good though but is it worth $7.50? Nah I\'d go for McCafe\'s cheesecake tbh.
Red velvet cake on the left were kinda dry. Crumbled Cheese cake worth the try!
the dish was good! it costs $15.90++ and the place is so whimsical and pretty!
Something different, compared to the normal Aglio Olio you can find from other restaurants. Turkey bacon and salad complemented the dish.
Lovely cute cafe halal owned n brings parisian feeling. Bon appetit😘
A place where you can just sit all day feeling whimsical and comfortable. Food\'s average and pricey, better to just get drinks and desserts!
Tried the Mexican and French Classic croissant..was pretty good!LOVED how the walls were so colourful :)
The ambience was lovely, with soft music playing in the background and chatter from customers. Business was slow, being a Monday afternoon. Food was delicious! Would come again. Spent $50+ for two people. 
You can never go wrong with a slice of cake &amp; tea! 
This quirky Halal cafe serves breakfast sets, selected bakes from Windowsill Pies, little cakes, and drinks at fairly reasonable prices. Fall in love with the pretty, whimsical decor and range of merchandise 
Read about this in an online article last night and just had to check it out today. Absolutely ADORE this loud-coloured, bold and out-of-this-world quirky little cafe 
Climb up the stairs and be transported to Wonderland! A totally unexpected little hideout at a junction of Kampong Glam :)
I only liked the macarons :( paid around 30 plus gst and sev charge JUST for these few items. Wasn\'t really nice either.
Cosy lovely place but had to wait really long for our food
Love the thick cocoa in my coffee, hate the extremely sour pie :(
Banana brittle is indeed a mysteriously surprising type of pie. Subtle sweetness, full flavour with crunchy bits of (my guess) caramel and chocolate.
Chanced upon this pretty place. They sell some really cute items from France. Would probably go back again to try their food (and interesting looking tapis which is actually kueh lapis)
$5.90. Not bad imo but could be a teeeeeny weeny less sweet.
Third cafe for today. Totally unplanned but glad we chanced upon it what a happy place to be in
Average cake price; $8\n<br />Ordered Chocolate Truffle and Salted Caramel cake. Went there on a Wednesday afternoon and there was hardly any other customers. The café is painted with bright colours and it\'s like you stepped in to cartoon world.

Featuring their rainbow [$8.50] and chocolate rainbow cake [$8.50]. Personally, I prefer the normal rainbow cake over the chocolate one as the sponge layers were light and fluffy with this enjoyable citrus aftertaste. Definitely a good place to get your rainbow fix. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #cake #rainbowcake
With my ladies ~ 
Price: Average cafe price\n<br />Ambience: its a CUTE french inspired cafe which is nice! However i have never been to a cafe which looks like it France. \n<br />Taste: 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽 the pasta is really good\n<br />Sadly we were too full to try the desserts! I think i will return next time for the cakes instead cause they look awesome!!! #burpple #halalcafe #halal #food

It is so cool, so dreamy! Selling all the pretty stationary and bags! \n<br />#bugis #sgadventure #lifexploring #waitingforfood #burpple
Nothing spectacular.
Waited for at least 30 mins before the food was served although it wasn\'t very busy at that time. The croissant is very crispy on the outer layer but slightly hard on the inside. The turkey bacon is very oily where you can see the excess oil but it has a special taste. Rating: 3/5
