My brother and I would often be the first two to wake up so as to catch our favourite cartoons on TV. (now we are the last to wake up üòÇ) All of us would then go to the nearest hawker centre in the neighbourhood to have our usual breakfast. \n<br />Breakfast would be a simple affair, my mum and dad usual order of Kopi-O while me and my brother would definitely be Milo-Bing! Most of the time, given our small appetite, my mum would order 2 soft boiled eggs for us. \n<br />The soft boiled egg would come without the shells. It would be a normal routine for us to add the dark soya sauce and pepper, and chop the egg yolks and whites up! My mum would nag at us if we add too much soya sauce. (AIYO TOO SALTY!) Me and my brother would then compete who would finish the eggs first as we shove the plates to our mouth and drink the eggs as if water. \n<br />As memories failed, I don\'t remember who actually won. But it\'s these small memories that you remember and not really the results. #hawkerpedia
Key is soft but not as smooth as the one at serangoon. Portions are sufficient though no small intestine. Pig skin not as firm as I would like. At $3.5 its adequate:) 
This stall manned by an elderly couple sells very traditional porridge, yam cakes and rice dumplings. It\'s at Telok Blangah Crescent Market &amp; Food Centre. 
Bounce in your mouth fish and meat balls with well mixed dry noodles makes a great breakfast. 
It\'s such a rarity these days - coffee @ S$0.80 a cup, complete with condensed milk + evaporated milk.
Decent and crispy roti prata, with fish/mutton curry or dal. PS: they sell putu mayam too!
Out and about with my mum, hopped on a random bus and alighted at Telok Blangah - exploring a hawker centre that we\'ve never been to before. Enjoying the new variety here :)
Well, the reason why this is on my IG becos the texture of the noodle is really good. Mixed with the sambal chill, soy sauce and pork lard... the taste of the noodle is üëçüëçüëç. The good news is that this is only $2.00!!! Very value for money. üòúüòúüòú This is from Â§©Â§©ÂêÉÈù¢„ÄÇ\n<br />#meepok #meepokdry #hawkerfare #telokblangahcrescent #foodie #foodporn #eatsg #foodsparity #jiakpahliao #burpple

I was looking for some warmth and comfort food and Xiang ji porridge have a Long queue of office people, as such i decided to jump into the band wagon.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The porridge was warm and gooey, just how I like my porridge to be and with an egg added, It makes the porridge smoother and a little sweet. The pork slices were tender and the owner gave generous amount of it. The owner also decided to add some preserved white radish ( for those who prefer savoury taste. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Observing the owner, she knows when the porridge is ready by placing a saddle on top of the porridge. By the time the saddle starts to sink slowly, the porridge is almost ready.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, it was a decent porridge but not life changing. Does anyone have any recommendation for porridge ? \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #sg #sgfood #Singapore #hawkers #hawkerfood #porridge #pork #warmth #comfortfood #food #telokblangah
