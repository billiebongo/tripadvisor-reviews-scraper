🎂🎉🎊🎈Special thanks to Aaron (supervisor for Thomson Plaza\'s outlet) for adding the birthday candle to the cake &amp; waited for our cue to come in to complete the surprise!👍Great healthy food, great service &amp; great ambience! Super satisfying and pleased that we applied for their membership today 😂😊👍#familybrunch #burpple
Tofu covered in purple rice gives a layer of crispiness paired well with savoury miso sauce. To top it off, they even include an edible golden mushroom at the side. Tomorrow\'s the last day to try Elemen\'s CNY menu, 元素新春8宝套餐. So don\'t miss it!
.\n<br />Another crowd pleaser from @elemensg CNY set menu.\n<br />.\n<br />Tofu exquisitely modelled like a steak and coated with a layer of purple rice drizzled with miso sauce. Plus points for coupling purple rice together with tofu for an additional nutrition value.\n<br />.\n<br />Last chance to savour these specially crafted dishes from set menu as they will be available till 31st Jan.
From Prosperity Truffle Yu Sheng to 5 Elements Soup before ending with a glass of traditional almond yam, it\'s bound to leave you satisfied and full.
Served piping and bubbling hot. Wholesome goodness in this hot stone pot - crispy pancake of glutinous rice, pumpkins, green apples, chestnut, king oyster mushrooms, all braised in red wine and teriyaki sauce. It\'s a favorite within our group, and I think the old folks would like this too.
This is like a dragon roll without using prawn and mentaiko. The crunchy tempura bits in the middle of the roll is a substitute for the ebi tempura. The avocado adds creaminess to the maki, balancing the consistency together with the refreshing carrots and cucumber. No meat and seafood here, but we didn\'t miss them that much.
In Chinese philosophy, the dark has to be balanced by the light. Given my no holds barred diet which can get meaty, oily and heavy, there\'re times I\'ll opt for healthier alternatives such as fish soup, or even vegetarian food at Elemen restaurant which I\'m a regular at.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I especially like the mushroom salad. They\'re plump, juicy and refreshing to the extent it\'s rather thirst quenching. But of course, alkaline rosemary water is always complimentary (previous photo).

This dinner at Elemen was so good, it didn\'t matter at all to the meat-lover in me that I was eating vegetarian cuisine.
If you\'re thinking of boycotting yusheng this CNY because of the sashimi woes, why don\'t you set everyone\'s mind at ease with their VEGETARIAN Prosperity Black Truffle Yusheng ($38.80++ for 3-4 pax, $48.80++ for 6 to 8pax) from @elemensg!
Caramelised wild rocket leaves and sauteed mushrooms, drizzled lightly with fragrant white truffle oil, on a thin, very crisp pizza base.
The light but savoury gravy (red wine &amp; teriyaki) hides a treasure of soft pumpkin, crunchy green apples, meaty king oyster mushrooms, and chewy glutinous rice!
This TRUFFLE MUSHROOM SOUP from the meatless concept, @elemensg may not be the most photogenic dish, but it is definitely what you\'ll need on this cold and thankfully, less hazy day!
Rainy day food has to be a bubbling hot stone pot of [Braised Golden Brown Pumpkin with Glutinous Rice] - pumpkin, green apple, King oyster mushroom braised in red wine &amp; teriyaki sauce, topped with a piece of crispy &amp; chewy glutinous rice! ⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />[5-course or 8-course Set S$23.80+/S$32.80++ per pax]
Rolling in the deep, green avocado sushi at 2 months old Vegetarian Restauant at Millenia Walk Interesting concept without the use of mock meat. 5 course set meal (SGD 23.80++) is available from Mon-Fri lunch time whereas 8 course set meal is available as SGD 32.80++ which could be as tasty!
5 course set meal (SGD 23.80++) is available from Mon-Fri lunch time whereas 8 course set meal is available as SGD 32.80++. Vegetarian meals can be as tasty too.
[5-course or 8-course Set S$23.80+/S$32.80++ per pax - Main course: Tomato with Mozzarella Pizza] - love the thin crust. It\'s topped with sundried tomatoes, shiitake &amp; white button mushrooms simmered in red wine sauce. ⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />There\'s a upcoming Kids Pizza Workshop on 26th September 2015, Saturday between 2.30pm to 4.30pm - whereby your 5 to 12 year old kids can have hands on pizza making session, learn about food ingredients, parent-kid bonding and walk away with a goodie bag! It\'s S$25++ per kid, walk in to pre-register!
Me and meatless don\'t go together because I don\'t have atless. Get it? HAHA!
#元素 \n<br />Start off your [5-course or 8-course Set S$23.80+/S$32.80++ per pax] with The Elemen Appetiser which consist of Green bean paste with cucumber with teriyaki sauce, sesame tofu with sesame dressing &amp; tomato!
This is more like Chinese porridge (稀饭) than the usual creamy, cheesy risotto we\'re used to. A healthier, more down-to-earth rendition, interesting textures from the mixed grains, very lightly seasoned yet tasty and easy on the palate.
All-vegetarian.
Who says meatless cuisine has to be boring? This Braised Golden-Brown Pumpkin with Glutinous Rice in Hot Stone is hearty, healthy and satisfying. All real food, no MSG or greasy aftertaste.
They serve 5-course set lunch (S$23.80+), and 8-course set dinner (S$32.80+). Refreshing concept, worth a try. The elemen appetisers, bread sticks with raspberry cream dip, salads and Wild Mushroom Cream Soup with Truffle Oil, to start.
Took my parents out for an impromptu, fancy, 8-course dinner at the 2-week-old vegetarian restaurant near office.
The evenings are so cool. And when you feel abit under the weather, hot tea is always soothing and calming.

I am not much of a \"vegetarian or salad\" kinda gal but once in a while it is always good to forego the proteins.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />One of my well-liked vegetarian restaurants to visit. This is new on the menu. Made with purple (my fave color) rice, carrot, cucumber, crispy tempura, chilli and shitake, the sushi had a spicy kick.  Loving the fantastic finish... nuttyness from the rice, crisp and a beautiful crunch of the tempura bits with a lasting tantalising \"heat\" of the chillis. A brilliant bold purplish hue.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Wonderful combi. Part of a 5-course set meal at $23.80. Now, do I feel better after?? Prolly alittle... the manager @elemensg is a nice guy who always remember me as the gal who takes lotsa photos and writes. When people remembers u, it is a nice feeling. \n<br />#lunch #vegetarian #hungrygowhere #burpple #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #singaporeinsiders #narratrs #eatbooksg  #elemensg
But I prefer a single slice which to me looks uncluttered and somewhat sexy.\n<br />🍕🍕\n<br />This pizza boasts of a thin thin crust garnished with sauteed wild mushrooms, flavored with white truffle oil. If that aint enough.... generous toppings of shaved cheese and arugula leaves. Oh.....did I mention this is a vegetarian pizza?? Lol...it is very yummy. So light...eat without a \"guilt trip\"😄 Elemen was our first stop to today\'s eatout. It was a great start with healthy foods with splendid company.
Armed and ready, so excited to videotape the flow. Alas... I cannot sing \"let it flow let it flow\" cos it did not flow😢. A lava cake which did not perform is almost a recipe gone wrong somewhere.\n<br />...... However, the upside was the cake was spongy, warm, moist, very dark chocolaty &amp; the centre tho not flowy, it had a delish not sweet gooey texture. Eaten with the sweet vanilla ice cream and butter crumbs for crunch, it was a perfect marriage in dessert heaven. Yes...happiness is having a not so perfect cake but still enjoy eating it.\n<br />#desserts #dessertlovers #cakelovers #cakeporn #lavacake #chocolatelovers #i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #burpplesg #burpple #hungrygowhere #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igers #igsg #instafollow #instafoodsg #tripadvisor #narratrs #townske_official #elemen #discoversg

Who says a non-vegan cannot enjoy her fine dining experience in a vegetarian restaurant? The vegetarian food served is not about flour and glutten! They simply go meatless, and did some fusion to give the dishes a total new flavour. elemen serves set course meal (you can choose either 5 or 8 course), and the price is really reasonable. I would definitely recommend my vegan friends to give elemen a try! Absolutely worth it! 
This 1 bite morsel is fragrant, with a nutty aroma. The tofu is so smooth and soft!
So zen.
grapefruit mojito. A grapefruit juice mojito that contains vit c &amp; antioxidants. On the bitter side but it is really refreshing and a great \"perk you 😴up\"  on days when one needs to be \"perked\"! #grapefruits #mojito #healthfoods #antioxidants #superfoods #beverages #burpple #openricesg @8days_eat @hungrygowhere @elemensg
The tempura bean curd was crisp on the outside &amp; so soft and smooth inside. Not even a tinge of oilyness. 🍓🍓 rice roll filled with jap cucumber, mushroom, bean curd, white sesame seeds &amp; strawberry slices was so delectable. Light &amp; nutritious. #sushilovers #sushi #strawberry #japanese #sgfoodie #burpple #openricesg #newrestaurant #bloggerssg #nomnom #vegetarian @elemensg\n<br />This is a place to try if one likes vegetarian non oily foods. Really love the way the staff introduces every dish. Good service😄
Appetiser from right ..green bean wrapped in cucumber, black tofu in sesame sauce (fave among 3) &amp; cherry tomato in plum sauce. #vegetarian #vegetables #sgfoodie #healthfoods #healthy #burpple #openricesg @8days_eat @hungrygowhere #newrestaurant #bloggerssg
