This tori Kara-age was so crispy! Well marinated chicken thigh fried to perfection. And drizzled with lemon, it was epic. At first I thot the pcs were so small, but they were big on taste. I would order this again.
This was a really small portion for $16. The rice was infused with the lovely scent of prawns. Very appetizing. Prawns were fresh but I couldn\'t taste any garlic. All in all a very nice bowl of fried rice, but I still prefer the fried rice from Menya Sakura.
From 1 August to 30 September 2017, there is a Ebi Shoyu Ramen Otoko Set Promotion which is available only during lunch. You get to choose 2 side dishes to accompany your ramen from celery salad, fried lotus, tofu, potato salad, and more. The set allows for free upsize of meat and vegetables, and comes with a barley tea, and the dessert of the day.
Pretty good. Miso flavours lightly complement the ebi broth. I personally prefer the shio version. But you know ramen, it\'s highly depends on the person!
So fluffy on the outside and creamy corn flavoured stuffing on the inside. Lovely! (8/10).
Loved how this bowl of ramen gets the basics right. Ultra hot broth that stays hot for a long while and ajitama egg done so right. Ramen is chewy and goes really well with ebi flavoured broth. Includes healthy servings of cabbage. Quirky interesting space. Highly recommended! Thanks burpple community for finding this! (8/10)
-\n<br />What\'s notable is that this bowl of goodness stays warm throughout my meal, due to the layer of oil however that also adds flavour to the broth.\n<br />-\n<br />Pair your ramen with premium sake specially curated for @jimotoyasg by @interriceasia!\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @jimotoyasg and @interriceasia for hosting us, and @justinfoodprints for the invite.\n<br />-\n<br />üçúJimoto-Ya\n<br />3 Pickering Street\n<br />Nanking Row\n<br />#01-44/01-45\n<br />(S) 048660\n<br />-

This ramen is the bomb!!!!!! The soup has a very strong prawn flavor which is so addictive then I drank it to the final drop, and I don\'t always finish the soup of the ramen so this goes to prove how much I like this! The tori karaage is super crispy but still moist and tender on the inside, definitely hit all right spot! I\'ve gotten the petite lunch set and it\'s just the right size for me. It comes with a dessert as well but nothing beats the ramen!

When I saw all the rave reviews that Jimoto Ya\'s corn croquette was getting, I knew I had to try it. And when I finally sank my teeth into one of these luscious lovelies, all those glowing reviews simply failed to do justice to how amazing these corn croquettes were.
This has got all the 4Cs‚ÄîCreamy, crunchy, corny, and highly comforting. Just be careful when biting into it because the piping hot lava erupts!
You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, or saut√© it, but the best way to do it is to throw it into a deep bowl of Jimoto-Ya\'s glorious garlic fried rice.
Jimoto Ya\'s claim to fame and the thing that separates it from its other ramen peddling peers is its signature Shio broth. Normally, ramen broth is built from a foundation of either pork or chicken stock, but Jimoto Ya\'s trademarked broth is built upon prawn stock instead.
Jimoto-ya is offering a ladies set lunch for $20 NETT that consists of a petite portion of one of their 4 ramen (shio, shoyu, miso and curry), two sides and a dessert. Fret not lads, you can still order this remarkably value for money set too.
üçú\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The complexity that Jimoto-Ya gets out of their shrimp shio ramen is pretty amazing. Shio, which means flavoured with salt not soy sauce. So that\'s nothing to hide behind. üèµ\n<br />It\'s a real test of agility &amp; precision for a ramen cook. \n<br />But their bowls are inarguably delicious that\'s packed with Umami. ü§§\n<br />The layer of shrimp fat on top of that bowl of ramen is the most delicious shrimp fat eating experience I\'ve ever had &amp; I do love shellfish. ü¶ê\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Not all ramen joints does great shio, is like finding a partner that ticks all your requirements categories (rare but always treasured) The flavour of the shio is the lightest of all the ramen Jimoto Ya offers &amp; it\'s a good start to wet your palette before venturing into the richer broths. üòã

Ebi Shoyu Ramen Set ($19.50)
Ebi Shio Ramen ($16.50)
Hokkaido Corn Croquette  ($6.50)
Those hankering after a comforting bowl of ramen should head to this ramen-ya in China Square Central (opposite Wang Dae Bak). Instead of the more commonly known pork broth, Jimoto Ya specialises in a unique pork and amaebi (sweet prawn) broth made from amaebi prawn heads. There are five items on the menu (from $16.50) including the crowd favourite Ebi Shio Ramen ($16.50). The flavourful yet light tasting broth is ladled over al dente noodles, crunchy cabbage, ajitama (marinated egg) and minced meat. Note that the restaurant swaps out cha shu for minced meat, claiming that cha shu doesn\'t go well with their soup base. For a hearty and satisfying meal, opt for the value-for-money sets that are available for both lunch and dinner. Each set ($19.50) comes with a ramen, a side (opt for the ebi tempura!) and complimentary tea.\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Justin Teo
We got a set A (chicken karaage) and a set B (prawn tempura) which includes free flow of water or iced/hot barley tea. Each set costs $19.50 nett! The broth is a mix of sweet prawn and pork. Very yummy. #burpple #tingzieeats

This dish takes 8 mins to make because it is cooked a-la-minute when the kitchen receives the order, and I like that it was al dente, fragrant and refreshing.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />There\'s a hint of spice due to the use of spicy oil, and lots of fragrance from the ebi oil used in the noodles. The interplay of texture and taste from the various ingredients used work well, with the pork loin, minced meat, sakura ebi, nori seaweed, cabbages, sesame seed, and sliced leek working with one another.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />To fully enjoy this dish, mix it well before eating. First squeeze the lemon to give the dish some zest, then mix it around throughly and eat it as you would a pasta, with a spoon and fork.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.

_\n<br />Uncommon in Singapore, they use a unique blend of japanese sweet prawns and pork bone broths for the ramen. The prawn flavour, reminiscent to that in local prawn noodles, stays strong and evident such as the shio ramen I had as only salt is added to the broth base, thus retaining the full prawn flavour. I\'ll recommend this to the first timers here.\n<br />_\n<br />Thank you @jimotoyasg for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for extending the soft launch tasting invite to me.

H O S T E D\n<br />The dark horse at tonight\'s tasting was the corn croquette. It was initially ignored in favour of the more glamorous looking dishes when it arrived at our table. But once we took a bite of the croquette, all of us were wide-eyed with awe at how good it was.\n<br />The deepfried battered coating was light, crunchy and amazingly grease-free, while the filling was ultra smooth and creamy with a subtle sweetness. Nestled in there were a few golden-yellow corn kernels that further enhanced the sweetness.\n<br />Regardless of the ebi or sweet prawn-based ramen you decide on, this is a side dish you should not miss.
Jimoto-Ya is an amaebi-focused ramen joint but they do seem to have some interesting nibbles. Even the humble lotus root has been jazzed up with a grainy and crunchy thin layer of coating seasoned with an addictive savouryness.\n<br />Munching on this will have you reaching for more drinks. But since when is that a problem? üòúüçª
H O S T E D\n<br />Sorry for the bad puns (I couldn\'t resist üòú) but seriously, the star at Jimoto-Ya is the sweet prawn-based stock. With the exception of the cold noodles, it is the foundation from which all their bowls of ramen rise. \n<br />They\'ve got a unique process in-house to ensure every bowl tastes the same at any time of the day or night: they actually have two pots of stock. One contains the prawn based one and the other, the pork. Whenever an order comes through to the kitchen, many things happen simultaneously. As the ramen is being cooked, the two stocks are scooped out in the correct ratio for that particular order and brought together to a boil before vegetables are thrown in. Then into that goes the cooked ramen for a quick simmer before the dish is ready to be served.\n<br />I chose the Ebi Shoyu tonight and loved its robust flavours. Those of you who like a lighter taste may find it a bit salty, so the Ebi Shio would be a better choice then. Don\'t panic about the layer of oil in the bowl. It\'s made with ebi and besides giving the ramen intense umami-ness, it helps to keep everything hot for longer.\n<br />The noodles are springy, which suit the liveliness of the soup well. And I found the sweetness of the cabbage welcoming. Last but not least, the egg was perfectly done with an almost-liquid gold yolk.
Ramen Set A/B comes with your choice of Ramen, deep fried chicken/ white prawn tempura, and house tea for $19.50.
$19.50 for the ramen + kaarage + tea set 
This restaurant hasn\'t been officially launched, but be prepared that I\'ll rave about this. I love prawn noodles, tasted many famous ones in Singapore, and this has the most robust soup I\'ve tasted.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The clear soup was intense in its prawn taste, made by boiling premium amaebi heads in stock before crushing all of them to fully extract every umami juices out from them. The result was clear, *PIPING HOT*, prawn broth so strong and sharp that I wonder how many prawns went into boiling each bowl.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Even though no char siu was added, I respect that they held firmly to Chef Mieda\'s view that char siu distorts the taste of the soup and do not go well with prawn broth. The minced meat aren\'t shabby either, try tasting the bits of them and you\'ll find that they\'re soft and sweet.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />If you love prawn noodles like me, aren\'t stubborn on having tonkotsu or other creamy types of broth, do not mind Hokkaido ramen as opposed to the more popular hakata ramen, and need a bowl of hot and robust prawn stock with noodles, this could be for you.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is taken during a tasting invited and hosted by @eunicestagrams and @jimotoyasg. You may drop by now and be amongst to first to try their ramen during this period of soft launch, or wait till everything is stable after they\'re officially opened on 27 March.
Dropped by the 3 day old Jimoto-Ya and got a bowl of the Ebi Shoyu Ramen - Signature Japanese Sweet Prawn and Pork Bone Broth Ramen with Soya Sauce Seasoning. Set B came with 2 pieces of White Prawn Tempura and refillable House Tea. You can also opt for the ala carte at $16.90.
As I was quite tired of tonkotsu ramen recently, I began the search for alternative ramen choices. Here I found a newly opened stall at China Square Nan Kin Way (I think?). I took some time to find the location of the place due to the renovations in the area, but to my surprise it\'s just behind the bus stop opposite Hong Lim food centre... anyways I tried re Shoyu one and my friend ordered the Shio version. Mine tasted really like a fusion between prawn mee soup, bak chor with egg and ramen noodles while the Shio version tasted more like hokkien mee broth! It was a refreshing taste from the start but it gets really salty at the end due to the rich shrimp flavors it had. Their tempura was really good (in my Singaporean standards). The place is pretty small maybe fit around 30+ people? But it was surely a great find and I have a feeling it\'s gonna be really crowded soon with such a unique taste for a ramen place!  *service was really ups there, every 3 minutes they refill my tea to make sure it\'s hot!
Home made gyoza at Jimotoya uses the right amount of shrimps and pork instead of the traditional pork and cabbage recipe for the fillings. The result is a firmer texture with a sweeter flavour! Love it.

üçú\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTKüíÆ: The complexity that Jimoto-Ya gets out of their shrimp shio ramen is pretty amazing. Shio, which means flavoured with salt not soy sauce.
