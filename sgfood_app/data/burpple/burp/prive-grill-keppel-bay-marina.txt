Doughy bread packed with creamy purple slaw and pulled pork knuckle. The bbq sauce was light and didn\'t overpower. The pulled pork in this sandwich isn\'t the soaking wet sort so the sandwich didn\'t get soggy. As it\'s made with pork knuckle, there\'s also a good mixture of lean meat, fat and chewy tendon. This sandwich was huge! The side of fries was also tasty. The ambience at Prive Cafe is really bright, airy and cheery. Love the sea foam green interior!! üåª
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />The portion was quite huge (forgot how much exactly) but the price is quite reasonable if you want to have your brunch with a choice of indoor cozy and peaceful place or an outdoor with yachts views.
Keppel bay remains my favorite place to go and yay look at this picture! It\'s taken in the super dark alfresco seats with my phone üíÅüèø. #iphonepride! And props to the company! Hehe!

Pretty to look at. Texture and taste a bit dry. Passion fruit taste is a bit too strong, would be better if it was a tad sweeter to balance the sharpness and tangy taste. 
Conveniently located near the golf course at Keppel Club, this laidback bayside cafe is a good spot for enjoying post-game brunch with your family. There is a sheltered play area for young children, while older kids will have fun putting together their own set meal ($12) using the illustrated menu, with choices like spaghetti and meatballs, fish fingers and DIY sundaes. Apart from usual brunch favourites like Eggs Benedict ($16), there are also more substantial mains like Pan-Roasted Seabass ($27) and Beef Mac &amp; Cheese ($20), available from 11:30am.\n<br />Avg price: $18 per person

Incredible garlic-butter sauce enhanced a splendid blend of flavour to the properly seared fish with a classy golden sheen. Served alongside steamed broccoli, polenta Parmesan cakes, roasted cherry tomatoes &amp; English peas, we can\'t ask for a greater brunch by the water edge.
happy friday! sorry i haven\'t been posting frequently because of school üò© \n<br />anyway, in this picture are the Homestyle Pancakes ($13) and the Eggs Benedict ($16). the Homestyle Pancakes consisted of fluffy pancakes accompanied by sweet sides, which were heavenly! the honeycomb and pancakes together were such a good combination, more cafes should have them. food aside, the view of the harbour made me feel like i wasn\'t in singapore! üòç
Sea Bass was done perfectly. Crispy on the outside, smooth &amp; leathery on the inside. Complements well with the rich buttery sauce. For my personal preference, if only the butter sauce could be a little bit more herby, like an addition of tarragon and chervil like B√©arnaise sauce üòä
Excellent starter dish from Prive‚Äôs brunch menu; will undeniably be a crowd pleaser if I could make these for Christmas potluck.\n<br />On a side note, so upset that Caf√© Week 2015 is over now, it‚Äôs like the empty feeling you get after finishing a good drama series.
With vanilla cream chantilly and chocolate shavings. Nicely caramelized creamy bananas topped with fluffy cream! 
Bringing you back to the childhood days kind of combination - chocolate and peanut butter goes too well together!
300 day grain-fed rangers valley rump cap with potato mousseline, slow cooked baby carrots, chimichurri and bearnaise - Just look at that char grilled exterior!!
Shrimp paste chicken was very tasty but small portions. The pulled pork knuckle sliders was great for a small meal and it was tender and juicy. Great atmosphere rockin\' to 90\'s music. 
Served with yuzu pearls, avruga caviar and rustic ciabatta toast. At $25++ for a 3 course meal, this was pretty worth it for my Restaurant Week October 2015 lunch! 
It\'s already been 2 days since my restaurant week dinner at Priv√© grill, and still I can\'t get over how satisfying and delicious this was. The flambeed lobster tail is the most succulent lobster I have ever eaten, and the herbed mushroom risotto, which reminded me a little of potato gratin, was just as excellent. From the first to last mouthful I couldn\'t stop gushing to my boyfriend how much I adore this dish! Really wish they could include this on their regular menu; I so want to have this again!
Eggs royales was my option rather than eggs Benedict under all day breakfast set that was offered. The difference is that I get smoked salmon instead of ham! Ooh yum. Big Breakfast Pizza was another plus dish to the day with crispy bacon, quality sausages, mushrooms, cheeseeeee and chunky roasted tomatoes on thin slice crispy dough with tomato sauce. We had triple chocolate which was really death seeking, every slurp is real thick chocolate. The citrus meringue tart tasted like lemon meringue tart but they had a really nice tart shell taste although it was alittle hard for me. 
was rather disappointed with the small portion of the eggs benedict which did not come with any sides. for the price of $16++ we got two pieces of english muffin topped with smoked leg hams, bacon and poached eggs. but well, we gotta pay a lil more for such a beautiful view of the luxurious yacht berthed over turquoise water right. for those who are looking to unwind themselves on a lazy weekend afternoon, Priv√© is definitely a serene hideout, away from the crazy crowd. 
After awhile it\'s kinda jerlat. But it tastes alright. (3/5)
The O List
Prive\'s version of this dish is simple, and simply delicious. This got me hooked to Eggs Ben, and with the dish so widely available today, it isn\'t easy making them taste great the traditional way. #prive #eggsbenedict #brunch #cafe #sgcafe #burpple
This Chinese dish made in western style is very flavorful filled with the essence of the original traditional dish! A whole spring chicken was used as well so it can be shared with friends but also good for people with a big appetite. The taste might be a tad strong though for some and it proofs to be a little hard to finish.
Had dinner at Priv√© on a Sunday and it was surprisingly empty! There was a lot of people sitting outdoors though, and I must say it does provide a much better view of the place but it was really too windy for my comfort. The fish and chips were decent, skin crisp to my liking. What I must definitely mention is the meticulous service provided, the staff actually came over several times to check on us as they were afraid they might have neglected us sitting at an ulu spot. Very friendly staff! :)
Very big portion. Chicken was too salty and sauces tasted weird. Atmosphere of the place is great and service was good. However this course was not worth the price. Rating: 2.7/5
Another of my fav. Hazelnut Praline Slice!! Like I said when they don\'t go wrong together, they don\'t! Basically it tastes pretty similar to the Ferrero chocolate we have! Its creamy texture + crunchiness from the biscuit like base was a wow! Pretty pricey at SGD8! Chocolate lovers won\'t say no to this! The cafe part of Priv√© has their operating detail as follows:  \n<br />Mon to Sun &amp; PH \n<br />- 9am to 12am (last order 11:30pm)
Just adding this post to reiterate the fact that chilling out late at night can\'t do without a beer! What\'s more an Erdinger! Half a pint costs SGD9! It\'s my fav beer. You? The cafe part of Priv√© has their operating detail as follows:  \n<br />Mon to Sun &amp; PH \n<br />- 9am to 12am (last order 11:30pm)
Introducing another brownie I madly fell in love with! Was chilling with my family late at night once and saw this. How could I not order right? There are quite a bit of nuts in it too for that chewy texture! Ask for it warmed up!! Each piece priced at SGD4 (only!!!) and oh ya, top it up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for another 3 bucks!! Aiya.. Just pamper yourself la. üòãThe cafe part of Priv√© has their operating detail as follows:  \n<br />Mon to Sun &amp; PH \n<br />- 9am to 12am (last order 11:30pm)
Pancakes were fluffy and good. It wasn\'t outstanding but i enjoyed it w their Gula Melaka syrup and lil honey comb treat. Great view of the boat club and great outdoor atmosphere. Also liked their eggs bene and chicken x butternut triple decker sandwich.. However their avocado and chorizo poached egg on toast was a letdown
Brunch is always a good idea, especially at a place with such a great ambience. We enjoyed our eggs benedict &amp; the milkshakes. 
Inaccessible but definitely worth the visit. Feel away from the city (a little)
I had a wonderful Australian rump cap (200g), served with a side mesclun salad. I don\'t know what a rump cap is (hahaha) but it was relatively lean like a sirloin, except thicker and juicier. I had my steak medium rare and it was grilled really evenly (thumbs up!), probably thanks to the expensive Josper grill that Prive uses. There was a creamy tangy sauce, and a choice of 4 mustards (I like the whole grain mustard!) but I had my steak on its own because it was tasty enough. Service was prompt and friendly, and I received a prettily wrapped slice of cake to take home as it was my birthday. The ambience at Prive Grill is elegant and romantic, especially at night as the restaurant overlooks the habour. Great for a date night ;) 
Moist and perfectly spiced cake paired with the right amount of tangy cream cheese frosting. Generously studded with fruits and nuts as well. Comparable to FBB\'s famous carrot cake, I feel!
My frd had this n i took abite of Rosti n it was abit hard on the outer crust.
With chicken chunks &amp; bacon,button mushroons n i opted for well cooked egg.Tasty!!
Roasted eggplant inside with mashed pea falafel, hummus and beet root tzatziki~
This was... baby spinach, corn, avocados, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, beetroots &amp; brown rice crispies tossed with apple cider vinaigrette and an additional order of grilled chicken breastüëçüëçüëç
This is really a milk shake but under the sunlight, with all the choc bits resting on the surface on this shake...it just looks like my kinda moon. 
a little pricey but well worth it...super filling and yum
s\' mores muffin, fruit tart, royal hazelnut praline cake and some lemon meringue thingy
Another brunch places to explore. No doubt, this is one of my favorite big breakfast set. 
Liked the egg and Norwegian salmon. Great outdoor setting in Keppel Marina. A pretty unique and rare experience in Singapore.
Lemon meringue pie looked wonderful and tasted yummy. In the background carrot cake which should stay in the background. I was surprised how busy Prive was at tea time. Nice ambience on a cool evening 
Beautiful place to have a romantic dinner. The smoked duck salad is better than Loysel\'s Toy! The pizza was not bad. Skip the Moroccan Spiced Chicken although I really liked the couscous. Reminded me of the couscous I had on board the plane a year ago. 
Oreo mud pie for dessert; a must have after lunch! I know where I got my sweet tooth from. (points to pop!)
best salad i had of late. baby spinach was a joy to chew on with that mild raw veg sweetness. but the real star is the toss of honey-lemon vinaigrette and the horseradish cream that was so delicately balanced that i don\'t having this as a meal on its own. 
the add-on of parma ham was no mistake and is a must i would say. gave the pasta a much needed jolt of sweet salty flavor. linguine was al dente enough and pasta stayed moist enuff for the whole course of lunch.
totally love the soft pillowy muffins but if only the yolk is slightly more runny for me, this already very good egg benedict could have been perfect.
What you need is beef patty cooked according to your preference. This is just nice and tasty with the sauce!
Finally! üòä
This cake is bliss. The sponge is light and moist, and not dry/crumbly at all. The thick stuff is the ganache - it\'s simply decadent, so rich and lusciously creamy. The crunchy maltesers on the top of the cake provide great contrast to the softness of the sponge and chocolatey stickiness of the ganache. This is a must try for chocolate lovers. Two thumbs up. 
Keppel Bay may be rather inaccessible for those who are not driving, but Prive is a place that you must visit at least once. Their straight cut fries with truffle mayo dip is amazing, as is their brie burger. Don\'t order their pasta and fish and chips though! Go there on a sunny day and ask for outdoor seating (:
This burger is good but a bit too small for my voracious appetite! I prefer wedges to fries as they are not as salty, so I didn\'t exactly adore these fries, but for anyone else who has no problem with that sort of thing the fries are fine! I LOVE the bacon and cheese in this, it definitely ups the flavor-factor x1000. But the burger patty is quite greasy and the oil soaks through to the bottom bun, soaking it completely and making it thin - this, I did not like. 
Steak Frites
Straight Cut Fries With Truffle Mayo. Fries are not infused with truffle. The truffle mayo is not strong enough. Heard good reviews but am disappointed when I tried. 
Eggs ooze-factor: 0%. Had a texture more like ramen tamago. This is it. I\'m going to hunt down the best eggs in town!! #nofilter #eggs
The splendid view overlooking the yachts suited for a brunch celebrating my mum‚Äôs birthday over the weekends. One of our favourite hangouts. Family time is always good.\n<br />.\n<br />#privesg #sgbrunch #keppelbay #JoEuGoEat #onthetable

The boy\'s order of Spaghetti Aglio Olio ($18) medium spicy serves with of bacon, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, birds eye chilli, wilted baby spinach, pine nuts and parsley. Sweet tomatoes gently balances your lightly pan-fried bacon while the pine nuts toss in a mild earthiness, with chilli throwing in some heat. The simple, light flavours lift the pasta, keeping it from being cloying, whilst the generous portions assure your satisfaction, freckling every mouthful.\n<br />.\n<br />http://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/2017/02/18/Priv√©-Caf√©
With dinner at Priv√©, we chose our Straight Cut ($10) with curry mango mayo, housemade ketchup, spicy mango chutney, garlic mayo and mustard mayo, rather than exchange the array for a serve of truffle mayo. Tossed in truffle oil (+$4), the delectable fragrance hit before it was even placed. It\'s better and good enough on its own as the sauces, simply, were sweet without distinction. I presume exchanging it for the truffle mayo would be wiser. 
$14 for this pan cake on a public holiday. The place is kinda crowded. It might be a better place to hangout during the tea break time for quieter and less crowded chili out place
Great place to have a chilled beer

Only found 2 skinny slices of bananas.
Only let down was the risotto, it was prepared for the Singaporean palate aka soft &amp; mushy instead of al dente.
Great dish with a nice presentation but it was served at room temperature. No idea if it was prepared in advance or forgottenp on the countertop after prep.

I still managed to sneaked a mouthful! Lol! Loved the generous bacon &amp; wilted baby spinach!
Attentive crew &amp; good food!
Love the maple-roasted bacon and though eggs were overcooked, the meal is still good overall. üòä #breakfast #yummy #instagood #foodlover #vscofood #onthetable #whati8today #food #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodporn #foodpornography #getinmybelly #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #happytummy #foodphotography #foodpics #icapturefood #foodstamping #openricesg #burpple
Served with whipped cream &amp; butter too.

It\'s my favourite too - maximum chocolate, minimum carbs - healthy yet indulging! There\'s nothing else like it right now, and we came up with it really just to satisfy my craving for something like this. #privegrill #privecafe #privesg #privekeppelbay #theprivegroup #burpple #chocolate #dessert #darkchocolate #cake #lowcarb

Nice dessert 
Average food but the surrounding view is nice. 
Juicy patty that crumbles with every bite. Every Sunday morning branch needs a burger like this to kick start the day with awesomeness. Not to mention an awesome view to go along with your scrumptious meal. #wueat #beef #burger #prive #8dayseat #instafood #sgfood #sgeat #foodie #burpple

From bottom right: Prive‚Äôs signature mushroom soup with a hint of truffle oil, served with crusty garlic bread (not bad), Ultimate Fish &amp; Chips (they got to improve on that batter), Spaghetti Aglio Olio with crispy bacon, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, birds eye chilli, wilted baby spinach, pine nuts and flat-leaf parsley (I ‚ô° this dish!) &amp; Badass BBQ burger with thick juicy waygu beef patty topped with Prive\'s secret bbq sauce, button mushrooms, dried bonito flakes, gherkins &amp; garlic mayonnaise (not bad, maybe I should try their Simply Prive\'s Burger next time)

Iberico bruschetta with mozarella and avocado sour cream.
My favourite aphrodisiac.
The cakes look better than they taste...

seafood pot-au-feu
Caesar salad
Eggy, creamy, smooth, with the taste of baileys suspected! Penne cooked just nice. Bacon elevated the taste.
