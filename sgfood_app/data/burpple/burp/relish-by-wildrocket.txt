But since this is The Affogato Bar, I couldn\'t miss not going for it. I was super glad that I did. The espresso was bitter as expected but I could take it with the ice cream and it was soooo smooth. The carrot cake flavor ice cream was my second pleasant surprise 😘 Soooooo gooood 😍I was so happy that we made a trip to this newly open place since Mother\'s Day i.e. 13.05.17 👍🏻\n<br />☕️🍦 #burpple
Finally back here to give their Pot of Honey a try — an Affogato that comes with either Vanilla Ice-Cream or Dark Espresso Ice-Cream (my choice was the latter), Vanilla Sponge Cake, Whipped Honey Butter Cream topped with a double-shot espresso of the Grande Tazza blend (beans from Coasta Rica) roasted by Dimattina Coffee, this is an Affogato more suited for those with a lighter palate — the sweet, buttery flavours of the Honey Butter Cream subtly runs at the back of the tongue while the espresso gets soaked into the vanilla sponge cake for that hint of aromatic coffee flavour. Simple, yet a pleasure to have.
No? Haha. Check out Asia\'s first standalone affogato bar at Cluny Court and tell me what you think! • Death by 🍫 • @theaffogatobar [2/2]
Show them some love and drop by Cluny Court to try out some of their original concoctions today! • 🍌Rumble • @theaffogatobar [1/2]
chocolate sorbet, brownie chunks, chocolate streusels, chocolate top hat, topped with Grande Tazza (espresso double shot)
Tried Banana Ramble and Death by chocolate affogato here. For me, it is easier to finish Banana Ramble with all the nuts added in as part of the affogato. For espresso lover, they should go for death by chocolate which the espresso taste is stronger than expected (probably because of the chocolate ice cream so the espresso they use give a stronger and bitter taste) which is a bit difficult for us to finish.
Very pleasantly surprised w this affogato! 🍌The butter pecan ice-cream is super yummy &amp; pairs perfectly w the roasty espresso shot! ❤️ They were quite generous w the banana slices as well that weren\'t at all over-ripe. The only thing I didn\'t quite enjoy was the spongey cake at the bottom of the affogato. I still prefer my affogato being ice cream &amp; coffee. The cake was over-moist, mushy &amp; soggy by the time we got to it. Would trade the cake for another scoop of ice-cream any day! 🎶
Carrot cake ice cream &amp; espresso! Loving their interesting flavors of ice-cream here! ❤️ Didn\'t quite enjoy the cake at the bottom of the affogato as it got pretty mushy &amp; soggy after the espresso is in &amp; prolly as the ice-cream melted but I can totally see myself coming back here for ice-cream &amp; coffee 🐝✨
If you love affogato, this cosy, inviting spot in Cluny Court serves fun, creative renditions perfect for indulging in with a friend. While an affogato usually comprises a shot of espresso poured over a scoop of ice cream, The Affogato Bar gets creative with the dessert. Go for the Carota Carota ($13.90) — one of the more popular affogatos on the menu that sees carrot cake ice cream set on a small slice of carrot cake and topped with walnuts, homemade cream cheese and macadamia nuts. Pour in the double shot of Mocharoma from Melbourne and let the carrot cake soak up all the coffee to give what Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua describes as a sudden addition of aromatic earthiness. Apart from affogatos, The Affogato Bar also serves bagels like the Roast Beef Bagel Sandwich ($14.50), that comes with a choice of seasalt or sesame bagel. \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
Quite an innovative concept I would say, since one would always assoc affogatos with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso. .\n<br />🍴\n<br />Carota carota. Carrot cake ice cream, carrot cake crumbs with walnuts and a mocharoma espresso. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 The carrot cake ice cream has a tinge of cinnamon and mixed spice that really reminds you of carrot cake. The slight bitterness of the mocharoma is balanced out by the sweetness of the ice cream and cake. 🤤 Plus the richness of the spot of cream cheese added on top just completes it. .\n<br />🍴\n<br />For my love of bagels, I decided to try it too. Their bagels are from a local supplier though they make the cream cheese themselves. I got the wholewheat bagel and sundried tomato cream cheese. Wholewheat bagel has Rosemary and flaxseeds that adds a nice crunch to the bagel. The sweet sundried tomatoes also give a nice touch to the cream cheese. However, the cream cheese from carota carota and the bagel can get a bit heavy when eating all alone. 😝\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />Nice quiet place to work on a Monday afternoon. Though they do not have wifi available for customers, so only do wifi-independent work . 🤷🏻‍♀️ Well irony is I ate here because I was on the way to allow the contractor to set up the wifi in our new house. Haha and yes we have wifi but not a dining table. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #theaffogatobar #affogato #bagel #stfoodtrending
Hand-rolled Bagels ($2.90 each): Regular, Sea Salt, Sesame, Wholemeal. 
Coffee here is excellent; the Dirty Chai Latte ($5.50, left) &amp; Cappuccino ($5.00, right) did not disappoint.
Aside from customised cream cheese bagels, there are also Bagel Sandwiches on the menu - I had the Breakfast Club ($12.50) on a Sesame Bagel, which was pleasant.
This is a chocoholic’s dream come true, especially if you also love coffee.\n<br />Comprising a super gao dark chocolate sorbet, chewy brownie chunks, chocolate streusels for crunch and a shard of chocolate \"top hat”, the espresso (Dimattina Grande Tazza) added a much needed contrast against all that richness. We found it a little hard to finish towards the end, so make sure you share this with at least one more person. 
When I feel like having bagels I usually go to Sasha &amp; Sons, but here’s one more spot to sort that craving out! 
A choice of your bagel (sea salt came recommended), slivers of corned beef, arugula, fresh red onions and a layer of sun-dried tomato cream cheese to bring it all together. Simple but satisfying.
Death By Chocolate is one of the two items under their signature Affogato menu — this one comes with chocolate sorbet, brownie chunks, chocolate streusel, chocolate top hat and a jug of double shot espresso on the side. This probably would suit the chocolate lovers more especially with the richness of the chocolate sorbet — incredibly smooth, chocolate and velvety with bits to crunch on, though could start to get a little bit heaty overall with the espresso being poured in. It\'s still much like having a chocolate dessert with a cup of coffee, but my heart probably would lie with the Carota Carota which was more well-rounded for me especially for one who prefers non-chocolate desserts
While the bagels are not made in-house, they are hand-rolled by their suppliers and kept fresh without being frozen. Roast Beef Bagel Sandwich comes in two options of bagel — the Seasalt Bagel and the Sesame Bagel; we opted for the former. The bagel comes firm, dense and chewy — every morsel simply comes with  a bite. In between, it comes with a balanced proportion of crunchy, leafy greens and tender roast beef which was pretty wholesome. Quite a good bagel in my humble opinion (but that being said, hadn\'t had a bagel in ages anyway; oops :x)
From The Affogato Bar; newly-opened at Cluny Court serving up their signature dessert Affogato and fresh hand-rolled Bagels — mention the word Affogato and pre-NS XW (aka Fat XW) would be pleased; possibly one of my favourite desserts before my enlistment.
Is. Good. #tingzieeats #burpple #throwback
-\n<br />Apples and coffee, I never knew they could be a couple. Their personality could not be more different. One is crisp, quick witted and tart, while the other is mellow, strong headed and bitter. Perhaps they bonded over the vanilla and cinnamon and grew closer together.\n<br />-\n<br />That being said they are such a cute couple, that could just eat them with a spoon!\n<br />-\n<br />Monster could eat anything with a spoon!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #theaffogatobar #handsinframe

The TCC affogato is our must-order until it\'s removed from their menu.  So we are so excited when we heard the opening of this first Asia affogato bar.  Friends tried the sweet Banana Ramble and i have​ this bitter Death by chocolate affogato.  Quite impressive though, but we still hope tcc will put the affogato back on the menu.
☕️ Signature bittersweet symphony (dark cocoa, vanilla chai and espresso), great mix! -\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #eathealthy #burpple #dinner #icecream #gelato

Glad that they have great tea selection too\n<br />🌿
This Death by Chocolate affogato killed and sent me to heaven. Absolutely loved the intense chocolate sorbet that complemented the espresso without overpowering it.

This is their take on the Death by Chocolate ($13.90), um prices are damn steep here by the way.

Chocolate sorbet, brownie chunkies topped with Grande Tazza.
It was a lazy Friday morning before 12pm. Affogato *geddit, geddit?* have my breakfast after I chanced upon this aesthetically appealing quaint cafe. Tried a scoop of Carota Ice-cream ($4.50) and the Dirty Chai Latte ($5.50). The ice-cream was satisfying and a very interesting flavour (carrot cake). The latte was creamy but I would prefer it to have a stronger kick of spice since it is chai.....
Top it up with double shots of Mocaroma from Melbourne and you will have a fresh awakening from the strong, robust dosage of caffeine.\n<br />An innovative concept with niche variations of affogato desserts, this is a place to revisit again to try out the rest of the offerings.\n<br />.\n<br />🏣501 Bukit Timah Road 01-04B, Cluny Court Singapore 259760\n<br />.\n<br />🕚Opening Hours: \n<br />Monday to Sunday 8:00 am – 11:00 pm\n<br />.\n<br />💲Cost: $12.90\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #igfood #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #igfoodies #foodgram #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #vscofeed #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #exploresingapore #singapore #singaporefoodie #burpple #burpplesg
If chocolate intensity was an animal, this would be a fairly motherly hippopotamus after Thanksgiving dinner. 3.9/5
