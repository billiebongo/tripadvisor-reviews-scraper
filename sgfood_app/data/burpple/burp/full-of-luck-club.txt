I loved the rich yolky and almost milky taste of this dish. However the truffle taste in the beef had been overpowered by the sauce and egg. In fact I did not even realised it was truffle beef hor fun until the bf told me 🙊. There was no wok hei taste either. This is still a dish better obtained from hawker centres, sans the truffle.
These baos were supposed to be like mini sliders, but instead of burger buns, chinese fluffy steamed buns were used. .\n<br />I liked the kung pao chicken bao more. The patty was crispy and the chili padi in the sauce gave the bao a good kick. However, it tasted nothing like a kung pao sauce to me. It was more like a bbq type of sauce with chili padi. The smoked duck bao was more of a let down because there were only 2 very small slices of smoked duck in it, and the coleslaw (which tasted like it was soaked in way too much wasabi mayo), didn\'t pair well with the smoked duck. For $9.80 for 2 baos, I think it was still of good value to try out these baos.
Here you could DIY your own peking duck pancakes🦆 at an affordable price 😋
No better way to enjoy CNY than with my favourite festive dish… This is Full of Luck Club\'s rendition with Crispy Fish Skin, Salmon Yu Sheng and Yuzu Dressing. $48 Dine-in or takeaway. A more citrus flavoured, light Yu Sheng so that you have space for other delicious dishes.\n<br />— Full of Luck Club —\n<br />243 Holland Ave, Singapore 278977\n<br />#FullOfLuckClub
Food was rather ordinary, couldnt taste the truffle in the truffle beef claypot rice... #BurppleXChope
Flavours worked well for us with the classic taste of spicy chicken taking centrestage complemented by the crunch from crushed peanuts and lettuce. Any two of these from the menu comes at $9.80++. Not something that would feed a hungry man but would be good appetisers.
Getting my hands all dirty from a Salted Egg Yolk Prawn Bao and a Panko Crusted Portobello Bao from Full of Luck Club using UberEATS! 🍴\n<br />Would have preferred the salted egg sauce to be made with SOME salted egg yolk rather than just salted egg yolk powder for the price. Though overall it was quite decent. I loved the Panko Crusted Portobello though! (Though at the same time, I would have ordered w/o Mayo next time). They spread normal Best kinda mayo on the bottoms Bao and squeeze Jap Mayo on top. I feel that it overpowers the flavour of the portobello but that\'s my personal opinion. If you like mayo then it\'s perfect for you. Oh and their raspberry pu erh has a nice tinge of pu erh!\n<br />🍴\n<br />And isn\'t it obvious today is Cheat day 😝\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #fullofluckclub #ubereats #saltedeggyolk #saltedeggyolkbun
These 3 dishes + a pot of tea and 2 bowls of rice set me back by $60 :0 with that amount, I probably can visit a tze char store and order the same dishes for 3 times. But that said, the food here was pretty fantastic!
That dipping sauce at the side tasted faintly of mustard(?). But I didn\'t really need that. The pork belly was already well marinated (with fermented beancurd, Chinese wine &amp; fragrant spices according to the menu) and is flavourful on it\'s own. Crispy and not too fatty. Totally capable if stealing the show from the mains.
I love mee tai mak. And I love bah chor mee. So this is like the best of both worlds for me. 
ADDICTIVE. Just as it is raved about in all the reviews I had seen. 
While the fancy interiors look daunting at first, the lunch set was surprisingly affordable at $9.80 for two \"Baos\" (pictured) and a drink. You can select between several flavours of baos from the braised pork to salted egg yolk prawn, and at the end of a meal you even get your own fortune cookie!
【beancurd, enoki, sauce】very delicious and i swear this is better than most tze char places! The taste of the spinach on the surface of the beancurd is very evident, and not just for show (as it usually is in Chinese restaurants). Do try their awesome Crispy Duck and Deep Fried Corn in Salted Egg Yolk too!!
🍦\n<br />Presenting the [Hokey-Pokey 🍦Fried Bao, $6.50] - 🍦\n<br />Personally I\'m a fan of deep-fried buns cuz they\'re absolutely crispy and tasty. It\'s a unique combination with creamy honeycomb 🍦 accompanied with mini toasted marshmallow and generous coca chips.\n<br />.🍦\n<br />I\'ll recommend this for folks with sweet tooth seeking a reasonable and delectable dessert 👍🏻
Ok, I admit this is addictive. Unknowingly, these corns are popping nonstop into my mouth! 😋
Picked the salted egg prawn bao and Kung bao chicken set. Loved the iced lychee oolong. But most of all company works magic~
At first glance, this contemporary Cantonese restaurant in Holland Village resembles yet another hipster cafe, thanks to its striking blue framed doors and edgy graphics. But look beyond that and you\'ll find some innovative Chinese fare like Chilli Glazed Fried Fermented Bean Paste Chicken Wings ($8), Golden Sand Corn with Salted Egg Yolk ($4.80) and Hakka Crispy Kurobuta Pork Belly ($18). Unconventional dishes, but so tasty. The 97-seater restaurant conveniently located beside Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao is the perfect spot to bring your family for Sunday lunch, or when you need to accommodate a large group of friends. \n<br />Avg price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Marc T
It came like that. We asked if we actually ordered it. Haha... Quite clever I think coz some people don\'t like sauces. So they can pick the top ones.
4 munchies: Stir-fried with XO and thick sweet dark soy sauce, the slight crisp on the caramelised exterior of the radish cake was outstanding. The inside was piping hot and filled with cubes of lap cheong; best dipped with the chilli sauce for added garlicky and vinegary flavours. Do also grab a pint of Gambler\'s Gold to go with these light bites!
Just when you thought salted egg craze had died down. Here is a bowl of Golden Sand Corn in Salted Egg Yolk ($4.80), a light bite that\'s super addictive!!
Loving the modern twist on classic Cantonese cuisine here. Expect quality stuff because it\'s by the same team behind Li Bai Cantonese Restaurant @sheratontowerssg More on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio!
Gonna have surf and turf tonight at @panpacificsingapore  but this stuffed Yong tau foo in a spicy fermented bean sauce @fullofluckclub would be super awesome too. That meat paste is dayum!! Oh and that crispy duck with steamed pancakes and hoisin is 😍 too! Go get some now!! Review to be up soon I promise!!
Easily recognised by the blue panel door as you exit from Holland Village train station.
A nice sear all around, coated with the salty dark fermented sauce. The inside should still be fluffy with chunks of radish and lup cheong!! Must order at @fullofluckclub! I will only share the bean sprouts (only because I hate them). 😏
What\'s not to love about hot pillowy buns especially if they are sandwiching a heavenly braised pork belly or a crunchy panko crusted portobello! Loving the bao burgers at @fullofluckclub by the people behind Li Bai (@sheratontowerssg). Pick 2 baos for $9.80. Honestly I\'ve not seen such a generous slab of pork belly in a Kong Bak Pau. 😍 more of last night\'s feasting still on Snapchat @msskinnyfat Go see!
They have baos like Kung Pao Chicken, Braised Pork Belly and Salted Egg Yolk Prawn. Portobello is the one I like best!! Crispy fried portobello mushroom, teriyaki mayo sauce all over, served with carrot slaw and grilled pineapples. Goes well on white steam baos too.
.\n<br />This Panko-Crusted Portobello Bao ( 2 for $9.80 ) is good enough to fill my tummy on a pleasant Sunday.\n<br />#fullofluckclub
Not too bad. I bought home the kong bao and salted prawn for family and positive feesback. Tried their fried radish with xo sauce under dim sum, ok as well.

Brought to you by Li Bai 😍
(Any 2 for $9.80) \n<br />In frame is the Kung Pao Fried Chicken, Braised Pork Belly and Panko-crusted Portobello. I personally like the nicely fried portobello alongside w the fluffy steam bao. Other options were the Salted egg yolk prawn and Portuguese pork chop.
4.5 munchies: Marinated with savoury fermented bean paste, I loved how these deep-fried chicken wings stayed super crispy even after being glazed with the chilli sauce that had a combination of spicy, sweet and sour flavours. Tender and juicy on the inside, these wings have got to be the crispiest I\'ve eaten yet!
tried the newly opened Full of Luck Club! tho portion were small (good for groups of girlfriends on a diet), their fried squid side dish was delish! (not pictured)
Food is good! New try of the new creation of pau burgers. They have flavours like salted egg prawn, kung pau chicken, fried portobello, Portuguese pork chop etc etc. Small mini bites could actually be filling!\n<br />Favourite pick would be the salted egg prawns and portobello pau! They have some other side dishes which seems pretty decent. The mango prawn roll is a must try!
Fancy some  bao such as Salted Egg Yolk Prawn Bao, Braised Pork Belly Bao, Kung Pao Fried Chicken Bao, Portuguese Pork Chop Bao and Panko-crusted Portobello Bao (any 2 for $9.80)? Has the potential, but don\'t come expecting Little Bao standard. \n<br />It\'s just fun food. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/05/22/fullofluckclub/
The braised pork belly was stick-in-teeth chewy with an accompanying teasing sourness from pickled lotus root and sparks of tingle from the chilli padi, whilst the prawn involved was essentially a fried prawn fritter after a long day at work being bossed around by an incompetent megalomaniac.
#onthetable we have 4 out of 5 savoury options: Salted Egg Yolk Prawn, Kung Pao Fried Chicken, Braised pork belly, Panko-crusted portobello. All kiaped between a soft steamed bun. .\n<br />Every diner will also be given a Fortune Cookie in gold wrapper, reminds me of little cosy Chinese eateries in the States.  #fullofluckclub #TGIF

Grilled for 45 minutes and torched with sugar, the meat was chunky and juicy. The skin was also aptly charred, crispy and flavourful. A sinful guilty pleasure!

Both dishes featured are familiar/typical dishes, but they were very masterfully prepared. Radish cake was not oily. And yay because they plucked the beansprouts on both ends. I don\'t really like black pepper dishes, however that beef was so tender and tasty, I had no choice but to clean my rice bowl.

The sweetness of the grilled pineapple play an important role in holding the different components together.
Full of Luck Club!!! And obviously the Moonlight Truffle Beef Hor Fun steals the show 🙆
I like the spicy and tangy kick coated on the exterior of the chicken wings on top of the juicy meat.

their braised pork belly flavour is a must try! Panko portobello was a little overpowered by the mayo though.
Check out this ­gorgeous bowl of hor ­fun, with black garli­c truffle glaze, silk­en onsen egg and slic­ed US prime boneless ­short-ribs. I’m not a­ fan of Hor Fun, but ­the truffle flavors a­re prominent and enti­cing enough to keep me wanting more! This ­dish lacked the kiss ­of the wok, but I sus­pect it was spec­ially cooked this way­ so that the truffle ­notes can shine.\n<br />#fullofluckclub #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #whatiate #whati8today #sgigfoodie #eatoutsg #burpple #openricesg #hungrygowhere #truffle #tgif #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #flatlay
SALTED EGG PRAWN BAO - the 2 LARGE tiger prawns were thinly coated and nicely fried, paired with a strong fragrant Salted Egg Sauce (which definitely beats some fast food branch that starts with M hands down), sandwiched between 2 nicely toasted Mantou\'s that were quite dense, giving it a really good mouthfeel (as opposed to a more fluffy and hollow one, this gave the dish and the sauce a little more depth). This was just one of the Baos that I had had the opportunity to try a few days back, and 2x any of this kind of bao is a meal of $9.80. Be sure to try their other savory Baos that were really good too!! #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #thegrowingbelly #southfeastasia_sg #singapore #igsg #instafoodie #sgig #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #whati8today #sgfoodtrend #sgfood #8dayseatout #fullofluck #saltedegg #prawn #bao #burpple
A couple of us prefer to leave out the truffle so we can get the scent of the wok hei instead of some artificial chemical. I think I will still go for KEK\'s version if I need a good plate of moonlight hor fun.

I agree with the group that the wontons were good.

The interesting signboard of this restaurant; totally attracts my attention which makes me dine in here; \"Full of luck club 福乐\". Let\'s have an unique type of bao包 for lunch today - Salted Egg Yolk Prawn 金沙虾 &amp; Kung Pao Fried Chicken 宫保鸡. I love the prawn the most as the prawn meat is so q and when we eat it together with the sauce, it\'s such a perfect combination.
Not really a corn fan, but the wife loves corn. With salted egg yolk, I don\'t mind having this!
I thought the radish cake itself was rather bland, saving grace is the external seasoning that coated around it to make it delicious.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #fullofluckclub #radishcake
Can\'t deny that the corn kernels are sweet with a good crispiness from the light batter coated around it.

The new concept, Full of Luck Club (福乐) actually took over the premises of the former Wendy\'s, just next door of Crystal Jade.\n<br />.\n<br />The Braised Pork Belly is like an upgraded version of kong bak pau. It comes with slow braised pork belly, lettuce, pickled lotus root, fried shallots, peanuts, coriander and bird\'s eye chilli. It has more textures and an extra omph from the chilli compare to the traditional kong bak pau.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #bao #steamedbun #porkbelly
