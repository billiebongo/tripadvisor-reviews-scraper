All this food for a mere SGD$59++ Read about the review on blogsite (click active link in bio)
Despite its price, the spread does not lose out to what other seafood buffet restaurants offer. Besides 4 to 5 types of crab, there were also other crustacean items for the taking. Hence, it is not hard to see why this place is crowded with eager diners even on weekday evenings.

GRILLED SEAFOOD of salmon, huge prawns, lamb chops, vegetable skewers and so much more including beef flank, scallops, crayfish, otah, escargots which are already in our tummies! The chef really grilled them fast and furious 💪😁 .
Panettone with cute decorations and.... A creepy Santa Claus eyeing greedily. There\'s also complimentary champagne 🍸 what a great way to celebrate! \n<br />#foodpornsg #foodspotting #foodiesg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #igfoodies #igsg #whati8today #burpple #hungrygowhere #8dayseatout #openricesg #sgcafehopping #sgcafe #eatbooksg #eatoutsg #malaysiancafe #melbourneeats #sydneyfoodie #foodgawker #hkfoodie #huffposttaste #buzzfeedfood #eatingnyc
