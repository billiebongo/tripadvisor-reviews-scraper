Today finally can tried their roast pork too as the last time sold out. The top is really crisp and meat is tender. But char siew is still the favourite. Top class! The layer of honey taste just melt together with the meat when you deliver the meat into your mouth.\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#ShotByXperia #ShotOnXperia #zhaoxingfieldreport #zhaoxingrecommendation #noneedtohideanymore #livelife #lovelife #wheretoeatsg #stfoodtrending #instafood #eathealthyandlivehealthy #burpple #todolist #instagood #nofilter #justeat #instagramfood #walktillwhereeattillwhere #eatwalkeatwalk
The noodles and sauce are thoroughly mixed which make every strand count!  Tasty and overrall, very satisfying! Seriously, they should really consider opening a specialized noodle stall!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#roastpork#charsiew#porkbelly#roasgparadise#noodles#hakkanoodles#roastmeat#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#tanjongkatong#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

It’s has everything on point, from the succulent texture, it’s fats/lean ratio, it’s taste, and even how it look. The moment you bite into it with your teeth connecting onto the ‘melt in your mouth’ fats and  tasting the ‘charred honey flavor’ is where you realize that you don’t need to spend a lot on good food, but just need to know where to find cheap and quality hawker food! Roast Paradise is certainly one stall that has set its benchmark very high!☝🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔻\n<br />Special thanks to @roastparadise for introducing me their signature roast!\n<br />🔻\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#roastpork#charsiew#porkbelly#roasgparadise#siobak#pork#roastmeat#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#tanjongkatong#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
See the oils! See the fats!\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Thick slices that literally falls apart. The ratio of fats to meats is 70 to 30%. Nice caramelization. It is sweet. End part is probably the fave of many because it is charred till jet black. Fats melt in your mouth exactly like butter and slides down the oesophagus with a silky honey-like consistency. The little meat that were present were tender ... sonething which I did not get enough of. Accompanied by a bowl of hakka noodles. Quite flavorful.. perhaps a tad over and it was clumped together. A challenge untangling it.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Next time I will go for rice. Friendly service which is a major plus. My advice is to avoid peak hours as the queue forms pretty quick.
I can guarantee you that you will not regret. #wheretoeatsg #kallangoldairport #enjoylife #burpple #noneedtohideanymore
This received a thumbs-up from the whole family. Barbecued until the edges are caramelised and crispy. The meat itself remained soft and tender. I think this is now my favourite in Singapore. So shiok!\n<br />*\n<br />In case you are wondering, Malaysian style char siu does not typically have red colouring. It is therefore naturally brown.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_roastparadise #roastparadise #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious #soshiokpork

[Char Siew Wine Pairing Tips] Finally I have my char siew from Roast Paradise, with wine pairing by experts and no need to queue! I\'ve had expensive wine pairing dinners with upscale food, but I didn\'t realise even hawker food can be paired with wine.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I really enjoyed the pairing even though I\'m not a seasoned wine drinker. This wine chosen by @Cellaraid is light so it balanced off the saltiness and oiliness of char siew while allowing the lovely smoky crust of the char siew to pull through.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Pictured above is a full bottle of Bordeaux Chateau d\'arsac 07 Winemakers Collection\n<br />with 300gm of char siew courtesy of @Cellaraid as a housewarming gift. The retail price is $59 for 3 glasses of 75ml red wine and 200 gm of char siew from Roast Paradise, and includes delivery to your home.
Love their Char Siew as it is superbly caramelize and tasty. The owners even ask if I wanted the lean or fatty meat.. I added the roast pork for more guilty pleasure! On top of that, it is serve with chicken rice and the soup is self service.. Other than the meat portion being slightly small, it\'s definitely one of the better char siew that I\'ve tried and I will definitely return the next round to try their premium cut!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#roastparadise#pork#charsiew#foodie#eat#delicious#makan#foodlover#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#oldairportroad#chickenrice#roastpork#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#STFoodtrending#nomsteroffical
