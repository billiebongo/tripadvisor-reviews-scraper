however feel that it\'s over rated and pricy (not too sure about seafood price, but I know there\'s a big hole in mah pocket), but I enjoyed that it\'s normal to eat on the table, sauce and all, and you wouldn\'t be judged if you used 10 fingers to eat 😂 overall an interesting experience but I wouldn\'t go back for it.
Sri Lankan crab with prawns, clams, potatoes and carrots. I chose spicy and its just nice.
We got combo bag 1 and 2. We got combo bag 1 with their mild specialty sauce and contains a Sri Lankan crab + prawns, carrots, potatoes, sausages, corn and clam. While we got combo bag 2 with the something blanc (white wine) sauce and contains mussels, prawn, clam, potatoes, carrots, sausages and corn. I prefer their specialty sauce as its spicy and has a slight kick. The crab was pretty good and meaty but this is a very messy place to eat at. We actually requested for forks to eat the carrots and potatoes but was denied and they told us that we could only eat with hands 😒. The crab cakes were really good! Chunky and filled with crab meat! Pretty good place but for the price I rather eat at a zi char store w chilli crab.
Today\'s dinner situation: seafood on the table. Most of us actually preferred the garlic butter sauce to the mild spicy signature sauce.
In signature spicy sauce.
Spicy level wasn\'t too overwhelmed, still manageable for those who can\'t eat spicy food. Seafood is fresh there!:)
$65 for 2 pax, can I have chilli crab instead pls? Made a mistake of ordering the garlic butter sauce, became too jelat &amp; oily after a while. Will try their signature sauce next time round!
This was combo #1 which included a WHOLE crab•prawns•lala•corn•sausage•potato•carrot. I choose the spicy dancing crab signature sauce! you could choose the level of spiciness, as a spicy food lover the spicy level was pretty spicy already! haha thank god i didn\'t go with the extra spicy sauce!
Ever since i tried crab cakes for the first time at #ruthssteakhouse i fell deeply in love with crab cakes! the one at dancing crab was definitely filled with lots of real crab meat and kinda worth the $18.90 for 2 pcs 😆
The truffle fries was worth every calorie! and i will definitely be back for it! 😍 #trufflefries
$130. garlic and butter sauce. good but not the rest. \n<br />oh yes it\'s finally de weekends! any good makan places to recommend?
$8 per 100g (Min 500g) Flaming tiger prawns served with wasabi katsuo sauce, sweet wine chilli sauce and lemon pickled chilli sauce. 
1 Sri Lanka crab, 300g prawns, 250g clams, potatoes, corn and sausages served in dancing crab signature spicy sauce. 
Dancing crab classic lobster roll served with Cajun fries. 
Fizzy lemonade, southern sweet tea and lavender lemonade.
$80++. Sri Lankan crab, 300g prawns, 250g clams, potatoes, corn, sausages (so-so). Chose the dancing crab signature sauce (mild but it was the right amount of spicy for me), which was basically tomato based. The seafood was quite fresh, and my very messy 2h dinner (despite the hard work eating the crab) turned out pretty fun eating from the table. Corn bread ($5) wasn\'t good - like a bad version of Kenny Rogers\' corn muffin, too dry too hard.
Fresh seafood on the table, paired with signature sauce, proceed to eat with your hands and make sure it\'s messy. Finally, lick up all the sauce from your fingers. An unbelievable night :)
On the table tonight - Lobster rolls/ Garlic noodles/ Dungeness crab/ Seafood boil. #gluttony
Delicious seafood in a bag but the yum seng is irritating.
Must eat at dancing crab! At only $13++. Super yummy! 
Lobster roll at a steal at $23++, served with a side of cajun fries. Not fantastic but it satisfies your lobster roll craving. I\'d say Naked Finn\'s a winner for now. 
Let\'s get dirty and eat directly from the table with our bare hands! It\'s fun for group gatherings! There are 3 flavors: spicy, butter and white wine cream sauce. Finger licking good!
Unfortunately the best thing on this plate is the fries... #luckygotgoodkaki #lovemymakankaki
The seafood was definitely of good quality, but I wasn\'t blown away by the sauce, to be honest. Worth a visit at least though!!
upgraded from Sri Lankan Crab to Dungeness Crab so this costs $148 instead of the usual $80. it\'s really finger licking good! 👍😋
$23 for 2 Lobster Rolls &amp; a decent portion of Spicy Cajun Fries! 😋👍 the Lobster Roll at Pince &amp; Pints is slightly better but much pricier at $48.
Any good places to share for that? Suddenly a craving for Louisiana style seafood.
A must order at dancing crabs
Tried Dancing Crab with my parents. Another good meal before work starts tomorrow. 😋
The seafood boil here comes with three levels of spice to choose from: mild, spicy and extra spicy, all if which are rather tame. I expected more heat and Cajun flavours, but the spicy sauce I picked turned out more tomato-ish, almost chilli crab-like - perhaps a reflection of the backing the restaurant has from parent group, Tung Lok? \n<br />#crab #mussels #prawns #sausage #potato #corn #seafood #spicy #sauce #american #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #ilovemyjob
Probably the best fish &amp; chips I\'ve had in Singapore, with moist, flaky white flesh concealed in a thin jacket of batter and served with an abundance of paprika-sprinkled fries. 
Might sound like blasphemy to some of you, but I actually prefer my oysters battered then deep-fried, than raw. These plump babies make such bite-sized snacks, the crispy coating giving way to succulent flesh. 
In love with these moist, juicy patties of crab meat coated and fried in the lightest of tempura crumbs. 
I had Combo Bag #1 comprising of a Sri Lankan Crab, 300g prawns, 250g mussels, potatoes, corn and sausages at S$80++, which is pretty affordable. The sauce that we had was Buerre Blanc, which is a cream sauce with a little white wine. Do try out the various types of sauces available too. Will definitely be back to try more!
Talking about lobster rolls with @mshuying reminded me of the one I had with Cajun fries the night before flying off to Bali two weeks ago. The heavily buttered buns are a tad oily on the fingers, but they\'re toasted so well that I really didn\'t mind at all. And oh, that filling of creamy lobster chunks would have completely floored me if not for the fact that there could have been a little more to even out the ratio of lobster to bread. 
This is the place to be messy! You can choose to have the food dumped onto the table (plastic tablecloths are changed every time) or have it in the bowl (like so). It looked better when we attacked the seafood and spread it all out, but by then, my fingers were all messy and couldn\'t take another pic. Very satisfying meal with friends.👌No one will use their hp in between meals so you can have a good chat. :p #burpple
Crab cooked in southern American (Louisiana ) style. Great place for a crabby seafood meal with friends. You can order a few whole crabs with a variety of sauces to choose from much like what you would do at your Chinese seafood restaurants. For those who don\'t eat crab, there is fish &amp; chips, oysters, prawns and lobster on the menu.
The sauce we went for was Zesty Garlic Butter! Plastic apron was given to protect your clothes from the splatter and no cutleries are allowed (only hands can be used)! No regrets for this expensive and sinful meal though. We loved how garlic-ky (alot of garlic) and spicy the sauce was and how it went so well with the Seafood. Thank you Kae for cracking the Crab\'s to give Jae the Crabmeat. Jae also did her part to deshell the Prawns!\n<br />⚊\n<br />📍Dancing Crab\n<br />VivoCity 03-10\n<br />1 Habourfront Walk, Singapore 098585\n<br />⚊\n<br />✏#JaeplusKaeReviews\n<br />▪\n<br />💻 JaeplusKae.wordpress.com\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />#igsg #sg #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodporn #whati8today #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodgram #food #foodie #instafood #foodblog #foodblogger #feedfeed #먹스타그램 #먹방 #vsco #seafood

We absolutely loved the idea of eating directly off the table with the fingers and having to enjoy the mess with the food (try it if you have not). The crab combo had been our favourite, with a good mix of fresh crustaceans. Of course we topped up with more clams and mussels in the yummy Beurre Blanc white sauce. \n<br />But here at Turf City they offered a Beurre Rouge sauce which was a nice combination for those who enjoy spicy with some creaminess (think Laksa). In fact, different exclusive sauces are found at each of their 3 outlets. \n<br />The food not only got our fingers dancing but also licking-good throughout the meal. We enjoyed the ambience here that almost brought us out of SG. And as impressive was their efficient and friendly services from the hardworking staff who were not dancing but moving around non-stop to get the food quickly to the diners. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #seafood
Lets dance with the crab🦀🦀🦀
We had a 1.3kg dungeness crab ($13/100g) and another combo that has mussels, clams and prawns. Also ordered lobster rolls and beer battered calamari on the side. So much food, very expensive (almost $300) but quite worth it I must say.\n<br />.\n<br />The crab was so meaty and delicious in the garlic sauce, and the shellfish combo was in a thick creamy white wine sauce which I also used as dipping sauce for the bread from my lobster roll 😂. Definitely cannot dine here regularly, but an occasional treat is okay 😁.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#eatoutsg #reversedieting #ASandHP #burpple #sgfoodie #whati8today #sgeats #foodiegram #dancingcrab #dungenesscrab #foodofinstagram #iifym #instafood_sg #igfoodie #igfood #seafood #clams #mussels #sgfoodporn #running #runtoeat #eattonourish #sgrunners
I like mine with \"zesty garlic butter\" :) #alaskancrab #alaskankingcrab #dancingcrab #seafood #STFoodtrending
Just then, the music dropped and they were caught dancing side by side. Literally.
Or what\'s left of.
The classic French sauce is a hot emulsified butter sauce made with white wine, vinegar and shallots over medium heat. The creamy texture and sweet aroma makes it a great accompaniment to the seafood dish. \n<br />#ketohloh #8DAYSEat #cafehopping #burpple
Must try! 
With zesty garlic butter
It\'s good but I wonder if there\'s better? #sg #sgfoodie #sgig #eatoutsg #whati8today #8dayseat #sgfood #foodsg #singaporelife #burpple #pickatsg #singaporeinsiders #dancingcrab #lobsterroll

Xmas dinner
Wah good stuff!
You\'re probably thinking to yourself, it\'s a little pricey and it\'s a little simple. But let\'s not forget we are talking about lobster here. Simplicity in looks, exquisite in taste. Highly satisfying. #wueat #delicious #sgeat #foodie #8dayseat #instafood #sgfood #lobster #burpple
ITS A SO SO . 
This is only round one getting started.
Who\'s on? 🙌🙌
Fries day!!
With real chunks of crab! We were so satisifed with these babies! They\'re huge so you can share it among 4 pple!
Seafood!!\n<br />This was so good, delicious and fun! Here you get to eat with your hands, get them all dirty and no one will judge you :) Dancing Crab\n<br />The Grandstand, Turf Club
Cool experience eating straight from a table top
The crab meat wasn\'t as fresh as expected, saving grace were the prawns, as they were prepared fresh in front of us. Crab cakes didn\'t taste like it, rather bland. Rather disappointing.\n<br />👍👍\n<br />#burpple #8dayseatout #8dayseat #pickyeaterssg #sg #igsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodlover #sgfoodporn #foodinsg #foodcoma #foodgasm #foodhunt #foodstagram #foodvsco #foodspotting #foodforfoodies #foodphotography #lobster #dancingcrabsg #indulge #instafood #instagood #instadelicious #delicious #dinner #foodie #foodsg
