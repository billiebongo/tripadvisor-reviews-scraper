I guess this has become a more &amp; more popular item now. 😉
refreshing!
$5.00 nett for 2 scoops of ice cream &amp; 3 regular toppings. If you opt for premium toppings, it\'s $0.30 extra per topping. (The atap seed &amp; grass jelly are regular, peach is premium.)

What\'s in the cup behind? It\'s the coconut juice. At first I tot was water hahaha.

pulpy coconut ice cream for a hot day!
Love the topping. Prefect for such weather! 
Perfect for the hot weather and the taste is very close to Chatuchak\'s highly raved coconut ice cream! \n<br />@wimiicecream now offers the STRONGER 💪🏻 coconut-flavored ice cream 😊 So nice of the owners to allow us to mix the original and stronger version for our ice cream! \n<br />More info on Hannistellar blog (link in bio) \n<br />P.S. Somehow removing the coconut meat from the shell feels therapeutic 😂 #thaifood #coconuticecream #tasteofthailand #wimiicecream #321clementi @321clementi
