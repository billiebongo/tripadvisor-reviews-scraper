Chorongi bean with Kalita filter tasted so berry-like when cooled down.
Being a place that supplies to other cafes, I guess I expected more from the coffee. It\'s defo smooth and better than Starbucks, but it is a little weak. You can find comparable, if not better coffee in other cafes. 
They call it a blend of NY London coffee! No sitting, standing only policy which works!
Technically not a cold brew as it was filter brewed before ice was added into it. Like the fruity and floral accents going on in here, and came without a single bit of bitterness even though it had a medium body.
Coffee is my favourite in SG so let\'s skip to the lemon meringue. Lemon curd was delicious and tart, pastry was the right thickness and nice and crisp. Just enough of that meringue too. (Don\'t fancy the meringue part though)
5oz white. There was only 3 or 5oz white. I think a 4oz would\'ve been better. Would\'ve liked a richer flavour too.

The perfect blend for a long morning. 
If you\'re serious about your coffee, you\'ll love Nylon. Be prepared for a tiny, tiny spot under an Everton Park HDB block that aims to satisfy caffeine addicts one cup at a time. With an overflowing passion for coffee, these guys source, roast and brew coffee from all around the world. Don\'t miss it if you\'re in the area! Photo by Greedykat Scruffs
Love the way 7oz white is being done. Lukewarm, fluffy and the beautiful art they created. How good it is, it\'s how you drink and the art still beautiful.
Nylon coffee roasters is the place to discover top quality coffee, over at Nylon they serve brews in simple black or white at your choice of 3oz, 5oz, or 7oz. You can expect to taste excellent coffee from it\'s unique blend of seasonal coffee beans where they source from overseas. 
The best coffee in sg! 5oz or Iced white make my day!
Just had the best flat white ever at #nylon! \n<br />If you\'re ever looking for a relatively inexpensive, quality cup of coffee, you\'ve got to head to nylon at Everton park! (:

Crowded for a small indie coffee cafe.. Coffee aroma fills the air!!! :D üòç
my heart skips a beat when there\'s a cup of happiness in my hand.
Something amazing happens to milk when you introduce steam to it. At the right temperature, milk turns sweet to taste and micro foam (if your steam wand and pressure is right) causes the milk to be viscous and paint like. Added to the perfect shot of coffee with a swirl gives a touch of class and professionalism to a simple beverage that has formed our conversations over the years! So let\'s have coffee some time?

I was enjoying a chocolatey cafe mocha when it occurred to me that to drink a mocha is to gulp down the entire history of the New World. üèµ\n<br />.\n<br />From the Spanish exportation of Aztec cacao, and the Dutch invention of the chemical process for making cocoa, on down to the capitalist empire of Hershey, PA, and the lifestyle marketing of Seattle\'s Starbucks, the modern mocha is a bittersweet concoction of imperialism, genocide, invention, and consumerism served with whipped cream on top.üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />So screw Starbucks, that‚Äôs why Nylon is my go to place for coffee. And I like mine black. As black as my soul.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #nyloncoffeeroasters #nyloncoffee #longblack #nylonsg #coffee #caffine

Aroma of coffee tends to be the most fragrant on Mondays. Agree?

Would never ever have stumbled across this place without the recommendation. They roast their own beans and serve nothing but #coffee. Based on my #icedcoffee coffee I\'m optimistic about the beans. @nyloncoffee #nyloncoffee #singapore #singaporefood #sgfood #sgcoffee #burpple

Wohoo! The first time I really drink a cup of ‚òï without sugar. First sip was really bitter, but went on to enjoy this White 50oz from Nylon. \n<br />Recommended by @blackawfee. \n<br />#vscocam #singapore #nylon #nyloncoffee #coffee #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehopping #cup #sg50 #simisaialsosg50 #hipsterSG #burpple
It\'s been awhile.
\"Surface tension\" - a hallmark of great milk foam?
Kudos to the team at Nylon who dedicate their time and effort to making this coffee shop into what it is today #nofilter
Love the blend which aren\'t too acidic and mild. Soothing. Book \"stolen\" from my bro\'s @otknpr collection.

Somewhat hyped. But decent coffee nevertheless. Felt like a  crime asking for some sugar though. The place is a hidden find, and the standing bar ensures people get out quickly or takeaway. Id have liked a sitdown for my cup of evening coffee #5ozwhite
Hands down best coffee in SG! 
I almost forgot how good it is. It\'s been ages since I last visited; ironically I had accidentally discovered this place when I was at the vet\'s (for my pet, not me). It was only after I searched for it online then I realized that it\'s one of the better-recognized roasters serving good coffee in Singapore. #coffee #cafe #latteart #latte #coffeeplace #coffeegeek #coffeelover #cafejunkie #instacoffee #cafehopkl #coffeeholic #coffeeaddict #coffeelove #ilovecoffee #cafehopmy #iphonegraphy #iphoneography #iphonephotography

How deceitful my heart is.
Enjoyed the piccolo latte
Strong coffee aroma with balanced amount of milk.
My best travelling buddy.
Boss has now bought me an uncountable number of cups of coffee üòî easily one of the best coffees in town with complex layers of flavours and a crazy smooth texture
Wished I had the time to sit and enjoy instead

I asked for Piccolo but it really taste like cappuccino too milky for my liking, lack of coffee taste, won\'t repeat
