Salt baked beetroot, pickled baby beets and the raspberry yogurt came together in such perfect harmony, complementing the grey mullet ceviche. It was tangy but in the most pleasant way, whetting our appetites for the next course.
Well, on our evening, it was actually 44 ingredients to be precise. It was fun trying to identify which was which and we were later told that this is meant to stimulate conversations. We even had Nutella and our fav ingredient had to be the spicy chilli which came with a twist. This was a fun way to start the evening!
So when @100gourmet dinner for June came by I jumped at the opportunity. Bread service came in the form of crispy crackers with 3 types of butters. Can you guess what they are?
Oh I really love this dessert!! I usually steer clear of sour stuffs but this is indeed good 👍
At first sight, I was impressed with the plating of this Roasted Red Snapper (S$32.00) from Open Farm Community, because the decorations with the sauces looked so pretty. Then the reality kicks in when I saw that the portion of the fish was merely the 2D size of one fist.
Rigatoni is cooked perfectly. Not chewy and yet very \'Springy\' to the bite according to my Mom. I love the mushroomy cheesy goodness and I will have it all over again. #burpple
A beautifully presented plate of lamb shank. Looks good! Taste good! All is good 😃
Their revamped menu of familiar, local flavours also features fresh ingredients sourced from farms in and around Singapore, as well as their own backyard garden! #MediaTasting #SupportLocal
Love how they infused all the local taste into this chio dessert! Very Creative when it comes to the culinary techniques as well! Have a Try, be fast cause they do change their menus after awhile😅
First bite into this burger and the first thing it reminded me of was Mac\'s fillet o fish. My comfort food at its best. The fish fillet was definitely more gao and the fries were fried to perfection.
Not sure if they cured the trout in house, but it certainly was well cured. 🍴\n<br />I think I\'ve hit my daily limit of omega 3 &amp; sodium with the avocado, trout and cream cheese. 😂 The guacamole made with onions and cucumbers was a refreshing combination with the trout! 😋 The rice wafer added a nice dimension to the food items as well. 🍴\n<br />Expect communal dining over here because I overheard if you want a normal table, you\'ve got to reserve 3 weeks in advance! 😱\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #openfarmcommunity #sgfood #communaldining #curedtrout
Was intrigued to try this extra thick spaghetti and really enjoyed the extra bounce. I think the current version uses pappardelle though, but the Thai curry sauce is still the same plus the usual suspects — crunchy yellow squash pieces and sweet big chunks of crab meat. Although the sauce was considerably mild for a curry and wasn’t too rich, the Thai basil leaves did a pretty good job of brightening up the dish (unless you’re not a fan of liquorice).
Lemon tart with basil ice cream! I have to admit I\'ve never tried basil ice cream before and this tasted refreshing!
A thick slab of grilled grouper with tangy chimichurri sauce and an assortment of vegetables. The flavours for this dish was definitely milder and that perhaps was to bring out the freshness of the fish. Personally found this to be the least impressive dish of all.
The little twirls is Strozzapreti pasta is such a cute sight on the plate. Personally not a fan of this form of pasta, too dense and doughy for my liking. Nonetheless, every component of this dish scored: the sweet-savoury balance of the sauce, the way the well-braised meat slides off so easily and the unique crisp of the parmesan wafers. A dish with such well-complimenting components. 👏🏻
Anything mushroom I have to try. The Rigatoni pasta was cooked al dente in a rich, creamy and delightfully umami sauce, with button and shimeji mushrooms, pancetta and a good dose of blue cheese (so that it isn\'t too overwhelming). One of my favourite dishes of the night ☺️
Eggy, cheesy, creamy and sinfully yummy. This dish is definitely on the salty side with the various types of cheese and smoked haddock slices on the top but this starter is pretty big so it\'ll be great for sharing! 
Coils of al dente pasta in a moat of savoury jus from the ridiculously tender 48-hour barolo braised oxtail? Yes, pleeeease! 😍😍
This plate of mini pillows of potato with shredded pork sausage was absolutely delish. 👌🏼Using just enough flour to bind the mashed potatoes together, the dumplings\' texture was absolutely spot on! I loved mopping up the tangy and umami sun-dried tomato jus (it was more like a purée, really) with the gnocchi pieces, along with a few slices of shaved fennel to brighten up the whole ensemble. 🌟
With a dedicated section in the menu for pasta, it would be silly not to order (at least) one, especially this umami-rich party in the palate chock-full of locally sourced mushrooms, smoked pancetta, Stilton (just enough bits to get the job done) and a zippy balsamic reduction to cut through all that richness. It scored full marks on flavour for me with beautifully al dente pasta! 👅💦💦💦 #Burpproved
🍽\n<br />In frame is a Crispy Jurong Frog Leg from the @openfarmcommunity . And this appetizer consisting of 4 fried Frog Legs paired with Beetroot Fregola Pasta and Sour Sheep Cheese costs a whopping SGD 26++!\n<br />🍽\n<br />It\'s expensive. But I\'ll come back for more because the food here is really good. The fried frog legs were non greasy and tasted like fried chicken albeit in a smaller portion. But what blew me away was the Fregola pasta that came with it.\n<br />🍽\n<br />Texture wise, it was similar to barley but had a chewier texture. Mixed with their beetroot sauce and sour sheep cheese, it had a very addictive and creamy taste I loved so much I was scrapping the plate off every little ounce of the sauce. Topped with golden and red beetroot, this was a dish that is delicious, beautiful to look at and healthful to boot!\n<br />🍽\n<br />#freewifisg
This dish contains barramundi from Kuhlbarra farm, charcoal cooked sweet potato gnocchi from Cynthia’s house, Indian borage, pickled eggplant and sweet potato leaves from Open Farm Community’s garden. Barramundi fish are hardy and fast growing, which makes them suitable for aquaculture. Hence, this fish is currently farmed in Singapore. 
The fluffy cake is a warm greeting of fall, which reminded me of pumpkin pie, which I lurrrrrve. Enjoy each ingredient on its own – distinctively aromatic Gula Melaka jelly, creamy &amp; subtly sweet butternut, and crunchy pumpkin seeds granola – or spoon a little of everything and enjoy the hodgepodge of East-meets-West flavours in your mouth.
The tender oxtail was braised in a sauce that was lip-smackingly delicious; its robust beefy flavours deepened with red wine and clung nicely to each spiral. I personally felt that the pasta itself could have used a little more time in the pot as it was a tad starchy for my liking. 
We ordered almost the entire pasta selection, and this was my fav of all. I appreciate that the short version of rigatoni was used, enabling an even coating of the creamy (yet light) sauce, which was perfumed with a melange of flavours - umami, savoury, tart, and delightfully pungent (Stilton cheese).
A smattering of ingredients – chorizo, cuttlefish, ebi, green peas, crispy Serrano ham – laid on a bed of colourful, creamy risotto infused with beautiful floral notes. I still prefer arborio rice, as the carnaroli rice tasted a tad firm for my liking. Didn\'t really like that crunchy texture of each grain.
Be not deceived by its docile appearance. One bite into this sent waves of heat onto my tongue – surely a pleasurable sensation for some. Whiffs of lemongrass and kaffir lime fused harmoniously with yellow squash, coconut, crispy shallots, Thai basil, and sweet mud crab as a flavour-packed nod to the Land of Smiles.
We started our meal strong with this luxurious dish of creamy eggs, fork-tender smoked haddock fillets, and tarragon, baked in a skillet with cheese and finished with grain mustard mornay sauce. An eggscellent starter for sharing, but so good you might just end up hogging the dish (guilty!). 
I figured prob. haven\'t seen the best side of OFC yet, as the day was raining and the food was just ok. Definitely will go back there and try other things in a nice day, hopefully it lives up to al the raving... Take 2 to come!
Fresh Pacific oysters grown locally on the land of pulau ubin (Sea Farmers @ ubin). 
$8 for this bowl of aesthetically pleasing bowl. However the dragon mango puree was really gooey and lumpy, not exactly the most pleasing thing. Guess art is expensive
Bringing out the deep bold flavours of Pumpkin Pie with extra freshness and pop of acid from the chunks of citrus fruits. Big love for their flatware too. \n<br />18bucks/dessert
Umami bombs away 💣💣.\n<br />It\'s a tough life in the kitchens, so hoping @darrrible is learning loads 🙌🏻. \"Work till your idols become your rivals\"
And what\'s more is the lovely strozzapreti with 48-hour Barolo braised oxtail topped with parmesan wafers and wild thyme. I got to taste the super tender oxtail which was perfectly marinated and the strozzapreti that was cooked slightly softer than al dente. This would be a great way to pamper yourself on a Sunday.
The herb\'s subtle aniseed flavour complemented the fruit\'s intense sweetness perfectly. But if you ask me, I just love the colours. And the contrasting textures too. Ok, that\'s all.
House-made spring onion bun, subtle hue of emerald on the inside, sandwiches a generous slab of juicy, meaty, crispy chicken katsu. It is all then accessorised with — I copy and paste from the menu one ok — crunchy carrot spaghetti and white cabbage chiffonade. Both gets the lime + Japanese mayo treatment first; so, you get an inimitable tartness combined with that savoury creaminess. And then there are those addictingly seductive curly fries and nori sheets. Open wide now. Ok, that\'s all.
Pickled beetroot, red and golden, along with crumbs of sour sheep cheese add such beautiful balance of earthiness and tartness to the dish. Just like a sky full of stars hor? Ok, that\'s all.
Housemade Rigatoni Pasta with Pancetta slices, local mushrooms, pops of balsamic glaze and some stinky Stilton. Not a hardcore fan of blue cheeses myself, but these nuggets of Stilton gave each mouthful an extra depth.  Umami bombs away 💣💣.
Not the most photogenic of foods but this Coal baked omelette is creamy, cheesy, gooey and it\'s studded with flakes of smoked haddock. This falls into the category of foods where you just wanna close your eyes and hum a good tune whilst letting the flavours create a macho harmony on your palette. True gold, served piping hot in a skillet. Portion sizing is pretty large for a starter, so best shared amongst 4-6 folks. 
Lovely dinner! All their ingredients are locally sourced, dishes were Asian fusion inspired. We thoroughly enjoyed the coconut curry fish, laksa tagliatelle and the chicken katsu burger topped with curly fries. We paid a total of 100+ for 3 mains.
No one should underestimate these baby eggplants because they literally burst in flavour and texture when one dissects them. Not so heavy on the eggplant mushiness and taste, but more towards a good creaminess with a subtle flavour that is perfect to be savoured with those sourdough.
Ironically speaking, it\'s been a long time since we sat down and just ate and talk. Should do more often.
An addictive pairing of refreshing tangy tart with sweet and bold basil ice cream.Coming in 2 layers, the tart was lovely with firm layers of crumbs. It was so beautifully arranged that we had no heart to crush it. Another brilliant element would be the basil chia seeds that might irk some people but essentially gives a good play of texture. It is really easy to love this dessert.
So much promise with this one! This curried lamb scotch eggs boasted bombastic flavours, the spices hitting you with each bite. Breading\'s crisp, light, and not at all oily, and the molten yolk\'s just liquid gold. All it needs is a tad more seasoning (spices without salt is a huge no-no), and a better, tangier slaw.
Loving these pancakes! Soft and fluffy, while still chewy and a tad dense - perfect eaten with the mascarpone ice cream and little dollops of vanilla mascarpone. And those roasted berries *swoons* the crunchy granola added a nice texture and kept it all from getting stale.
They boast the concept of \"fresh\" from the edible garden to their food. Isn\'t it a brilliant place to spend your lazy Saturday in?
And of course the taste is as great as it looks. All the pasta are made fresh in the kitchen and the herbs are taken from their edible garden. They even have different pots of herbs on every table. Do choose the alfresco seating if you love fresh air and cooling breeze in the hot weather instead of the typical aircon indoor setting (though they also have an attractive open kitchen concept). The dishes themselves are outstanding. I love the smoked duck capelleti which was cooked al dente though I would prefer a chunkier smoked duck meat instead of a minced one. 
Sometimes, even the best company can turn your crazy life around... Grateful to this meal, the company and my life~ TGIF everyone!
Set across a sprawling 35,000 feet compound, Open Farm Community is the closest alternative to a countryside getaway. While parents relax on the patio with a glass of wine (from $12), there\'s lane bowling, a sand playground and table tennis to keep active kids entertained. When energy levels dip, head indoors to share hearty, comforting fare like Potato Dumpling Gnocchi ($27) and Strozzapreti with 48-hour braised oxtail ($28). Little diners can opt for the Strozzapreti with tomato sauce and sweet basil ($19) before ending the meal with the Lemon Tart with Basil Ice Cream ($18). Pro tip: Pre-book a tour of the edible garden on OFC\'s Facebook page to learn more about urban farming!\n<br />Avg price: $28 per person
This is what I call awesome service recovery: when a restaurant voluntarily offers dessert on the house after a prolonged wait for the mains earlier.
This is my favorite salad of all time now! Perfect for light diners.
Visited @openfarmcommunity for my birthday brunch with my family, and service was nothing short of impeccable. Even though the wait for our mains had taken a tad longer than usual, they more than made up for it by surprising us with a complimentary serving of Buttermilk Pancakes. So dope that I wouldn\'t have minded paying for them anyway!
The whole place with the edible garden and designer greenhouse structure that is the restaurant gave pastoral rustic vibes. \n<br />Confession: I misread the menu as capellini when I ordered the smoked duck capPELLETTI (very different type of pasta), so I got confused when it came. But I decided to go with the flow the moment the server poured the flask of tea infused with thyme and brown chicken jus over the handmade Italian dumplings.\n<br />The smoked duck filling was juicy and delicious. The chicken broth was a bit salty and lacked in complexity even though it looks very flavourful with the accompanying herbs. Pasta was quite well done with a nice bite despite appearing a wee bit thick.\n<br />#Burpple #BurppleTastemaker
Even though it\'s not his forte.\n<br />Very yummy oxtail pasta and grilled barramundi in the background. They plant all their own veg and herbs in the open farm which suggests that name. Love this place. Will be back again.
Oh my, some of the best gnocchi I\'ve had in Singapore, indeed. Every soft yet firm morsel of potato pasta accentuated with the intense sharpness of sundried tomato purée – absolutely scrumptious when shoveled into the mouth along with bits of savoury minced pork. Plus, you won\'t find your palate weighed down, thanks to the shavings of fennel that lift the dish with their subtle sweetness and refreshing crunch.
Fried pig trotters with tartar sauce from @cassecroutesg. Tender, fatty, juicy and delicieux!
From @kerbsidegourmet food truck : Pork collar with soft boiled egg and bean chilli, Sea bass and jicama.  Oysters from our local Sea farmers @ Ubin.
Pretty good food served at the mini farmers\' market just outside @openfarmcommunity. I had fun sampling different items and strolling around! You can make your way down anytime tomorrow from 10am to 4pm to render some support to the local brands! 😉☺️ #Burpple #SupportLocal #FarmersMarket #OpenFarmCommunity #oysters #KerbsideGourmet #Outdoor
Savoury and tender, this premium cut of pork has a smoky sweetness from the glaze. But the best thing about this was the ragout, like a Native American succotash, bright juicy corn with crunchy sprouts!
Nice bite to the pasta. Really liked the sauce as well, and the fact that there were chunks of fresh crabmeat. But my favourite part was actually the yellow squash - it provided a sweet and crunchy contrast. I could eat an entire dish centered around that squash. 
I say pasta instead of strozzapreti as is indicated on the menu because we weren\'t served strozzapreti - it was tagliatelle (I think!). Dishes like this are why I love freshly made pasta - this had a great bite. Generous amount of oxtail and a rich sauce that coated the pasta well = winner.
$17. Gorgeous and definitely lived up to the hype. Would have preferred it a little tarter, but the basil ice cream went surprisingly well with the lemon cream. Highly recommend. Good for sharing. 
$24. Eggs were beautifully poached and broke open to reveal luscious golden orange yolks. I liked the twist on the usual hollandaise. 
It totally made my week better. Coal pan omelette with smoked haddock, grain mustard and cheesy mornay sauce. With eggs cooked to such perfection, I will die a happy person.
Lamb Rump with Garden Peas, Bacon, Lettuce, Mint, Whipped Mash &amp; Rosemary Thyme Jus...\n<br />~\n<br />The only thing wrong with this dish was that it wasn\'t enough for me! 😭🙈🙊
~\n<br />This was a excellent appetiser to start off! The flavours were well blended with each other &amp; the anchovies were really delicious!!!
A very good variation from the usual eggs Benedict.  Worth it!
Essentially soft baby hat dumplings stuffed with juicy, mushy meat, sitting pretty in a fragrant jacuzzi pool of ayurvedic massage-enthusiastic Brand\'s Essence of Chicken consomme. 3.7/5
The yabbies had the supple flesh of a Hot Flow Yoga enthusiast, whilst the chilled soup managed to be simultaneously creamy and refreshingly light. 3.9/5
.
I can\'t even. Favorite dish at @openfarmcommunity! Creamy eggs with salty smoked haddock. Give me some bread and it\'s a brunch dish anytime.
Of all the mouth-watering dishes on the menu, it is the pasta that’s exceptional. Of the six that we had, there wasn’t one we didn’t love—that’s what you get when you have an Italian chef helming the kitchen.
Take note because this is how you do it. You create chocolate cakes that are served in varying temperatures – a warm one which is dense yet fluffy and a cold one which is smooth and luscious. You then scatter superbly addicting chocolate soil that holds the chocolate sorbet so well and provides it with a grainy texture for your every mouthful. A sheet of chocolate crisp and two dollops of velvet-like chocolate sauce later, your palate is well excited. Ok, that\'s all.
Crispy baked pastry sandwiching layers of lemon curd and custard cream. I really enjoyed how we can bite into the pastry and then a gush of citrusy lemon curd flavor burst into our mouths. The basil ice cream then comes into play to balance out the acidity level and introduces a weave of icy freshness! 
With thai curry sauce, crunchy yellow squash, coconut &amp; crispy shallot thai basil. At first look, it might look too small a portion but I thought the serving size is just right for a girl! Freshly made in the morning, the thick al dente pasta had a nice bite to it. I was happy to find a good amount of sauce on the inside, which can sufficiently coat the strands of pasta well. It is a simple dish but with well thought out ingredients and flavors. Please make sure you order the pasta when you visit Open Farm Community! 
But of course, it is more than just three letters. Probably the best lemon tart I\'ve had in awhile, it hits all the right note. The right amount of tart, the right amount of sweet, the right amount of crunch, the right amount of smoothness. Herbs in desserts...what a welcome ingenuity. And again, one ingredient interpreted in a few textures. With this, you get basil ice cream (yaas!), that subliminally exciting basil sauce with basil seeds, and crisp basil leaf as garnish. Ok, that\'s all.
This is the epitome of that. You start with caramelised mango — sweet and moreish — and you build from there with coconut of varying textures. Coconut cream with sago pearls, such familiarity and adds such lushness. Then, there\'s that rich yet light coconut sorbet...so good! A dust of desiccated coconut later and we\'re ready to rule the world. Yes, there\'s mint for garnish, but what I love is that unexpected touch of coriander...makes this dish so lovingly Asian. Best part of it all? All herbs are grown and plucked fresh from their garden/farm. Ok, that\'s all.
This beautifully plated Lemon Tart is unlike other normal lemon tart you\'ll see. Done up like a mille feuille, the slightly sweet lemon curd and crumbly puff pastry combined together with basil ice cream, it\'s surprisingly delicious~
What happens when you wake up ravenous: you think of carbs, aka pasta. And this gnocchi is so insanely good that we can\'t stop craving for it. 
Woke up this morning craving for this delicious seared tuna salad. 
This platter of roasted baby chicken is a joy to savour – crisp exterior with just the right amount of browning, and extremely juicy and tender meat. The braised leeks with its prior caramelisation add such depth to the dish in terms of flavour and texture. A drizzle of browned hazelnut butter with roasted hazelnut heightens the flavour of the chicken and glazes it for that inimitable golden glow. The subtle peppery note of the wild watercress caps it all off perfectly. Ok, that\'s all.
I would expect a spice-packed excitement to the palate considering the use of cili padi in this dish. But its subtlety worked really well with the tartness of the tomatoes – each burst with sun-kissed sweetness. The crispy calamari is equally amazing...its cornmeal-like batter provide such a welcome crunch to the mix. Ok, that\'s all.
But that\'s not to say the tuna is just ordinary, far from that to be honest. The crunch of the fruit and its slight acidity blend really well with the richness and beautifully charred sides of the maroon-hued pieces. Ok, that\'s all.
So, I was surprised — pleasantly, after my first bite — to see it on the menu. But this rendition is anything but clichéd. In fact, it was unanimously pure culinary joy for all of us on the dinner table. I love the house-smoked chicken the most. I\'ve never had chicken done so well – tender, despite it being breast meat, and so flavourful. The tissue-thin jamon is from 5J and packs such intensity on the palate. The aged brininess of the cured meat works really well with the crunch of the romaine. The egg is faultless, so is the parmesan tuile. The zing of the horseradish sauce, smeared across the plate, completes and holds the entire dish together. What a glorious masterpiece. Ok, that\'s all.
Eggs for brunch are perfect. The food was awesome. Bread was flavorful and eggs were poached perfectly. However, I didn\'t have a nice experience with the service. I wasn\'t dressed to the nines (well it\'s a lazy Sunday after all), so the receptionist kinda ignored me even after serving the jogger in front of me. A waiter doesn\'t seem very happy. No smiles nothing, feels very hurried. A very nice waitress (wish I got her name) was very nice and helped me check on our food because it was taking a very long time. I would only go back for the nice waitress, and only if I had to. 
There\'s nothing on this table of appetizers that we don\'t love! \n<br />Our favorites include the seared tuna with green papaya and jicama salad, and unique coal baked omelet with smoked haddock, tarragon and grain mustard mornay. \n<br />We\'ll definitely be back all too soon! 
Outdoor branch in a farm setting. A country side experience 5 mins from orchard road. Brilliant!
The Potato Rosti ($28) has scrambled eggs and sliced pork sausages with tangy creme fraiche &amp; red onion brown jus. I just wish there was a tad more rosti than eggs. Squid Ink Tangliatelle ($26) is slightly spicy and the pasta is kinda hard then expected. Did we take so long for photos? Personally I think the Roasted Goldband Snapper ($28) is beautifully executed as the fish is tender on the inside and retain the flavour.
Juicy wedges of caramelised mango combined with coconut flavoured sago, coconut sorbet and coconut meringue. The perfect finish to our meal!
🌱🌱 Great dining experince but we had to constantly prevent houseflies attacking our food.
Perceived as an upscale version of mango sago and mango sticky rice, the coconut sorbet and sago all worked really well together! This dish makes us miss the sweet yummy mangoes we had in Thailand 😚 \n<br />Ambience of the restaurant is quite interesting; while it\'s situated amidst a traditional-looking farm of herbs, the interior is modern and classy with marble tables and overhanging fairylights even in the day ✨ Needed our waitress to serving us to be a tad friendlier though 😬 #pleasesmilemore? #aussieserviceisthebest
Errone has dat #Baywatch moment 😎 // This sexay Aussie yabbie seems to be enjoying his swim in the Chilled avocado &amp; ginger pool [$20] with fresh radish as his lifebuoys! Don\'t be fooled by the pictures on Instagram though, cos the size of the \"pool\" is a lot smaller than expected 😕 \n<br />Apart from that, it\'s a light and refreshing soup that woke up my tastebuds on my first sip! 😨 Also contains cubes of avocado and accompanied by a side of small pieces of pita bread for dipping. Highly recommend this for avocado and citrus food lovers! 😄👍
😛 \n<br />My first brunch in Singapore after almost 6 months of travelling! Checked out this up-and-coming restaurant that just opened just a month ago cos #imstillafoodie #foodiesunite ✌️ • Strozzapreti with 48-hour Barolo braised oxtail, Parmesan wafers &amp; wild thyme [$26] • Initial reaction towards the dish when served: Pasta looks like Chow mein to me 😂 #jokesaside, while the oxtail is tender and sauce is tasty, the overly al dente pasta kinda ruined it for my bestie &amp; I 🙊
Pasta 101. Spaghettonies are these real thick strips of pasta, I\'d say the size of 5-6 sticks of cooked spaghetti put together, best paired with seafood based sauces. (I\'m learning something new everyday!)\n<br />These Spaghettonies are coated in boldly spiced Thai curry, fresh fleshy chunks of Mud Crab and yellow squash. \n<br />If Thai curries are your kinda thing, this one\'s definitely up your alley. \n<br />28bucks/portion

With chunks of caramelised squash, the firm house-made strands of pasta coated in creamy curry sauce packs a fiery punch towards the end of my meal. I love it. \n<br />And thank you @datbearchef for the sweet gestures and warm hospitality!
Now I wish to have a pot of herb in my room.
Finally visited Open Farm Community, a relatively new restaurant in a quiet corner of the Dempsey area, which farms their own vegetables right behind their restaurants (hence the name). The setting of the restaurant is really calming and open, similar to PS cafe\'s open concept with full length glass windows and a cosy alfresco dining in the backdrop of nature. My friends and I sat outside, beside the farm. Even though the environment was really serene, I got bitten by many mosquitos so it was rather uncomfortable. Moving on to the food, I followed the recommendation of the friendly waitress and ordered the Pumpkin &amp; Pine Nut Tortelli with Local Yabbies and Minden Pesto ($24). The pesto sauce was thick and delicious, and the tortelli was nicely stuffed and tasty. As someone who is not particularly fond of pumpkins, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the pumpkins tasted, with its crispy deep-fried exterior. My only gripe was that the portion was pretty small and I still felt hungry after my meal. Nonetheless, this place is worth a visit!
can\'t help but to miss the taste of this palate-pleasing squashed tomato. so visually appealing and lip smacking at first taste. can you imagine the tomato juice bursting in your mouth together with the juicy wagyu beef patty as you have the first bite? \n<br />anyway after much procrastination, SnapAndEat is finally launched! pls show your love and support (link in my profile)! #SnapAndEat #SnapAndEatSG
deconstruct the burger and I was caught by surprise with the squashed tomato right on top of the patty. brimming with freshness from their farm, the juices exploded with both sweetness and sourness in my mouth! really a genius combination with the meat patty which heightened the savory component. they even infused the bun with tomato sauce! \n<br />the wagyu beef was also seared with all the flavourful juices with a charred layer. a fresh twist with the squashed tomato!
It\'s going to be messy. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/07/15/openfarmcommunity/
Creative, though taste-wise, it could have packed in more punch. #openfarmcommunity #openfarmcommunitysg
It\'s a pity that this dish tasted just like our local \'mee pok da\', with too much chili padi used. Expected fusion with a twist, and this is too predictable. #openfarmcommunity #openfarmcommunitysg
Coated in eggplant purée, this fish was light and perfect for a Thursday evening girls night out.  
Cold soup is exactly what you need for a hot day!
A thoughtful collaboration between the Spa Esprit Group, Chef Ryan Clift and Edible Gardens, this edible garden concept comes with a gorgeous indoor terrace garden, fruit orchards, and even space for lawn bowling and table tennis. This 60-seater restaurant set on Dempsey hill might be as close to \"farm-to-table\" as we\'re going to get in Singapore, and it certainly is a breath of fresh air. Brunch is available on weekends from 11am to 3pm, with coffee from Common Man Coffee Roasters. Expect vegetable-forward dishes such as Chilled Avocado &amp; Ginger Soup with Poached Yabbies &amp; Fresh Radish ($20). For something heavier on the palate, go for the spicy Squid Ink Tagliatelle with \"Inferno\" Sauce ($26). For dessert, both the 8 Spice Apple Crumble ($17) and the Lemon Tart with Basil Ice Cream ($17) look and taste fantastic.
Generally faultless, apart from how everything seems somehow (over)familiar and then you look at the $17 price tag and go hmmm. 3.7/5
Say no to the placement of food anywhere too close to soil and flora, guys. Apart from creating health risks for yourself and other users of your utensils/plates (the kitchens clean them with the relevant agents dealing with dining use and clearly do not contemplate their exposure to foreign bacteria, bugs, microbes etc, and you might quite literally harm the next dude using those wares....if you haven\'t already fallen ill consuming the exposed food), it is not particularly possessing of decency and manners. Imagine your house guests snapping a picture of your fine china next to pigeon droppings around your HDB void deck area, uploading it on Instagram with captions like \"鸟不生蛋，是大便”, \"掉落” or inserting a moody poem, and then gleefully identifying you as owner of said china via tag and/or geotag. If you really wanna pursue your \"style\" in that manner, do seek express permission from the business owners that you wish to place the utensils/plates on soil and flora, and not merely state that you will be photographing \"outside\" or \"on the ground\" which suggests something entirely different.
Deceptively simplistic labelling, but the “crumble” here is a sum of many distinct parts – part warm and lovingly sweet apple chunks, part hard and nutty crunch, and part chao tar and intensely smoky bits which evoke memories of pineapple tart. Elsewhere, I’d skip the onion-esque (?) apple chip and lap up the sour-as-heck green apple purée. 4.4/5
The spiciness of the nicely springy pasta was a slow burn and lingered without ever being interfering, and I preferred the salty and addictive fried calamari over the more traditional naked version. Interestingly as I slowly conquered the plate I couldn\'t help but compare the combination of tagliatelle and inferno sauce with…char kway teow. 4/5 
The earthly tone, the touch of Mother Nature and farm inspired dishes were truely captivating.
Everything was delicious and the ambience was lovely.

I\'ve never tried duck omelette and this rendition did not disappoint. Generous amounts of smoked duck (lots of fragrant duck flavour!), chopped bell peppers folded into the omelette, topped with fresh tomato salsa, with a side of sourdough bread, smashed potatoes, onion jam, cherry tomatoes and a dash of balsamic vinegar •\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#weekendbrunch #sundaybrunch #happyfood #happybelly #happythoughts #brekkie #omelette #smokedduck #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfooddiary #sgfoodpics #foodstagram #foodtography #foodpics #igfooddiary #cannotstopeating #nonstopeating #kosyeats #kosyeatssg #burpple #burpplesg #fatdieme #hearty #heartybrunch

We all thoroughly enjoyed this course and the best way to eat it - like a sandwich! Press your fillings hard and chomp away.
A little on the spicy side but together with an organic egg yolk and pair with garlic crouton, I quite like it!\n<br />#ofcsg #openfarmcommunity #yummy #love #onmytable #topcitybites #exploresingapore #beautifulcuisines #stfoodtrending #sharefood #burpple

This was a rainbow. But sadly, I\'m not a big fan. 🌈
HAHA. 🙈
It was one gorgeous egg, I will not deny. Sadly as well, I was unskilled in positioning the yolk to ooze seductively for #eggporn. 🐣
Pity the pasta was too al dente for my liking. Service was also not that up to scratch. 🍴
Most popular dessert at the Farm, Lemon tart with sweet basil ice cream ($18++). Like it that the lemon tart is not too sour while the ice cream has a refreshing light basil taste. 😋 A pity ours toppled and melted cos we were busy playing ping pong 🏓.

🔼🔼\n<br />One of two desserts prepared. This is Pan of roasted raspberries with cinnamon and gingerbread ice cream.  The homemade ice cream (using European cream) was smooth and creamy with a distinct taste of star anise, cardamon, cinnamon and vanilla beans. Raspberries lightly roasted but still maintaining that tangyness. Having this dessert kinda reminded me of Christmas.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />Thank you Chef Bruno @bruno_menard for conducting the workshop and was honored to have met you. Thank you Richard @filipeur @sopexa for the invite to the private event that was meant for trade and chefs. Also thank you for arranging the transport to and fro the venue. Totally impressed.

The pastry was too hard to cut into, but the the zesty lemon curd paired with chantilly cream were the stars of the dish. My basil tastebuds have been spoilt by #bopgelato, but otherwise a decent rendition of basil ice-cream. #thisCuriousCraving #epicuration #burpple

I make friends/buddies thru drinking coffee. So it had been a long while since I visited @jayrossroldan .\n<br />◾◾\n<br />He asked me how is the coffee today? And I replied ... it was very good. Loved the addictive smoky finish that lingered on my palate. ◾◾\n<br />He is always concerned about how I liked my coffee and remembered the way I liked my coffee. It was a nice but short catch up session. Thank you, JayRoss, for always always showing your love and warmth.

Second time back at Open Farm Community - and I am always wowed by their out of the norm brunch/lunch dishes that are always executed with such finesse! This carnaroli risotto with chorizo, cuttlefish, ebi, green peas, saffron threads and crispy serrano is certainly a cut above the rest. The bold use of flavours like chorizo and cuttlefish was an interesting take on the usual seafood risotto. Topped off with crispy thin wafers of serrano ham, it was abit too robust in flavour to finish without getting jelat. Nevertheless, a must-try as it\'s a colourful sight to behold with an equally rewarding treat on the palette! Open Farm is easily one of my favourite go-to for brunch/ lunch 😍 #igsg #sgeats #igeats #igfood #sgfood #8dayseat #tslmakan #food #vsco #vscocam #burpplesg 
Spring onion my dear
The technical balance between coconut milk and spices carefully managed to pair with the meaty fish that graces the platter with its perfectly crisped skin
I like how they successfully bring together influences from east and west and make them work.
but with this rendition, it\'s easy to imagine the plump succulent sticks as quail legs instead 😁 SUPERB dish of {Crispy Jurong frog legs, beetroot fregola pasta, sour sheep cheese} new on the menu at @OpenFarmCommunity

Learned basic latteart from his coffee instructor and from then on, he became a barista. His interests grew deeper into specialty coffee as then it was becoming an in-thing. Acquired further and more indepth knowledge thru Youtube.\n<br />🍭🍭\n<br />Inspired by the experienced coffee connoisseurs, JayRoss participated in competitions such as latteart throwdowns and became the champion for CMCR (Commonman Coffee Roasters) 1st latteart competition 2013.\n<br />🍭🍭\n<br />He is the very first Filipino barista to land on our shore, making him the pioneer barista among all Filipino baristas. In 2010, he started his barista career in Forty Hands. Moved to Commonman in 2013. From 2015 till present he is now the Cafe Manager/Head Barista at Open Farm Community where he oversees the operations n trains new baristas on the job.\n<br />🍭🍭\n<br />His journey is not an easy one. Having to sacrifice time away from his baby boy to achieve his desired ambitions. It is truly not easy and heartwrenching. So whenever I visit him, I appreciate the coffee he poured. I will give him a hug to motivate, encourage and simply being a friend.😄 Thank you @jayrossroldan ... I am sure you will be an inspiration to those who will be embarking on a similar journey.\n<br />#coffeetime #coffeexample #coffeegram #coffeenart #thingsaboutcoffee #baristasg #pinoybarista #pinoybaristasg #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #narratrs #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafollow #schmicktv

This Thai Green Curry &amp; Mud Crab Tagliatelle was on point with perfectly cooked hand made tagliatelle, freshly picked crab meat, and subtle creaminess from the Thai green curry. \n<br />Sadly the Roasted Chicken was a little heavy handed on the vinegar based sauce that overpowered the rest of the dish. \n<br />But the meal experience ended on a high note with their Lemon Pie. A winning combi of tangy lemon curd, flaky pie pastry and basil ice cream.
that thai curry pasta was on point.

Omelette. Ever! I need this for #breakfast every day. The creamiest, fluffiest egg concoction and topped with the creamiest, tastiest grain mustard mornay sauce. In that pot of gold, you find nuggets of smoked haddock...that smokiness provides such allure to an otherwise clean flavour of the fish. A bouquet of arugula and ribbons of parmesan complete this coal-baked perfection. Ok, that\'s all.
The food there is down-to-earth (hurhur) and just plain flavourful. \n<br />#tuna #appetizer #foodporn #openfarmcommunity #farmtotable #eatclean #sustainableseafood #seafood #burpple #sgfood #foodsg #delicious #instafood

Loving the awesome view and natural sunlight here.
fuck you for reminding me of this amazing {Lemon and Basil Tart} tonight。
The pesto sauce has a rich, potent basil favor and it blended well with the tortelli (ring‑shaped pasta stuffed with cheese) and yabbies (freshwater crayfish) to create a really scrumptious and visually pleasing dish

Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime. Teach a man to create an artificial shortage of fish and he will eat steak. Jay Leno
Lovely restaurant, would recommend outdoor seating on a good weather. 
Lots of attention to detail with a meticulous layering of sour lemon creme and vanilla bean creme over tender planks of Sable Breton - the refreshing heap of basil ice cream making references to the lush garden settings outside。
The bright and daring colours of  the red inferno sauce being smeared on the distinct black squid ink tagliatelle creates a picturesque dish. The zesty and acerbic flavour stimulates your sensations for each bite that you take and leaves you craving for even more. \n<br />#SFL #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #8dayseat #openricesg #instafood_sg #burpple #cafehopping #ketohloh #snapandeat #hungrygowhere #foodsg #iweeklyfood #foodphotography #foodstagram #instasg #instafood #eatoutsg #singaporefood #foodpicoftheday \n<br />#foodpic #foodpics #fooddaily #food

Clean refreshing flavours 💁🏻 20bucks/bowl
Nice textures and interesting flavour profiles (though the Tuna wasn\'t the most fresh on the day we visited, which was a Sunday). The puffed seaweed sago cracked was delightful, I could have finished an entire bowl of those between courses. \n<br />On a side note, their flatwares are completely adorbs. Each are handcrafted and mostly made in Bali. 
It may not be as pretty as the lemon and basil tart but this stood out as the better dessert.  Refreshing and rich at the same time.
Open Farm Community serves up very decent organic fare.  This pasta was spicy and excellent!
Both the mushroom rigatoni &amp; oxtail stozzapreti were really goooood
