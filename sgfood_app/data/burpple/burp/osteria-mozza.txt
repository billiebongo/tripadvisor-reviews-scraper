If the sounds, energy and spectacle of dining out give you a thrill like it does us, few places get it right the way Osteria Mozza does. Shining on the menu is the corzetti stampati ($25) with eggplant, olives and bufala ricotta. Each piece of pasta is folded with slightly drier ricotto (for a subtle taste) enhanced by herbs and olives; hand stamped with a wooden carved seal. The unique texture of this stamped noodle gives a different intensity and bite each time you sink your teeth into the pasta. We reckon you won‚Äôt have tasted any handmade pasta quite like this.
Kickstarting our brunch was Chef Ariana\'s assortment of pastries that came from the attractive display on the bar counter. It was hard to make up my mind (everything looked sooooo tempting) but eventually, I settled on the brown butter tart, banana bread, lemon muffin with blueberries and the olive oil cake with rosemary and orange peel. With the exception of the banana bread that I felt had too much walnuts, the rest of the pastries were excellent. My favourite of the lot was the brown butter tart. It had a great pastry base, rich buttery filling mixed with the juiciest sweet blueberries and a troupe of crunchy, icing sugar-dusted almond flakes dancing across the top. Having said that, the lemon and blueberry muffin was also one of the nicest muffins I\'d ever eaten. The pronounced zing of fresh lemon in there was just gorgeous!
Meet the quirkily named \"Green Eggs and Ham\" ($30++). Think of this as an adventurous eggs ben that has forsaken classic hollandaise to dabble in the unexpected - scallion oil. Which explains the moniker. As it enhances the poached eggs, Prosciutto de Parma ham and rucola leaves with flair, the green scallion oil earns a unanimous \"YES\" from my entire panel of tastebud judges. Those plump little grilled baby tomatoes are wondrous too. Being skinless, they\'re intensely sweet and burst like tiny juicy bombs in my mouth üòã\n<br />The one bone I\'d have to pick about this dish is the sourdough toast. It\'s a little too crisp, shattering with each cut. Not ideal.
When I am not in the mood to make frequent trips to and from buffet spreads for Sunday brunch, I like a place that indulges me with a great a la carte menu and nice ambience. Osteria Mozza with its good service, is one of my top picks.\n<br />I have never had anything here that I didn\'t enjoy, including this Wagyu beef with olive oil fried egg. The meat was superb and perfectly done but I wouldn\'t expect anything less given its price. Elevating it with a refreshing note was the liberal amount of minty \"salsa verde\" - such a pure palate stimulant. Even the medium-sized whole roasted potatoes (hidden under the egg) were visually interesting with their flattened crisped-skin form.
Fresh creamy burrata paired with the best of ingredients! Crunchy, creamy, salty, sweet and sour in one bite.
Amazing fresh maltagliati is cooked al dente and have a great bite. Duck rag√∫ is perfectly seasoned and robust. Delightful dish! Pasta is also served on a heated plate, which is a very nice touch. It\'s the little things that make it an enjoyable dining experience.
This banana gelato pie with hot choco fudge, candied hazelnuts topped with THAT fluffy scoop of fresh whipped cream was my piece of heaven on a plate! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòã #cheatday #Friday #foodie #dessert
Sunday Brunch
The beef really delicious. Inside the meat is medium rare and outside have a slight burnt smell which make the beef even tastier. The sauce matches it heavenly.

These Maple Sage Sausages are something you should try! It has a nice sweet maple taste in it.
What appears as an ostensibly small dish was actually very satisfying. We loved the succulent beef strips but the tagliatelle could have been a tad softer. We also liked the piquant tomato sauce - not too thick, not overwhelmingly sour. Mark finds this place a bit too sophisticated for his tastebuds but FBBNNY was overjoyed. 10/10 will recommend.
There was a lot of chocolate so the creme fraiche really helped to clean the palate. And although the tart was dense, I still found myself reaching for another bite. #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #osteriamozza #chocolate #chocolatetart #sgdesserts #sgfood #sgfoodies #marinabaysands
The beef came with a pesto sauce, roasted handcut potato wedges and a sunny side up. The beef was tender at medium rare and the pesto sauce was quite raw in the sense that it wasn\'t over-flavoured. I liked that there wasn\'t a heavy sauce that masked the flavours of each ingredient and the roasted potatoes were gr8. #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #osteriamozza #wagyubeef #sgfood #sgfoodies #marinabaysands
I quite liked the pasta and the ragu which was flavourful but not too heavy. Not sure if the pasta is handmade but I did spot a pasta roller in their open kitchen! #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #osteriamozza #tagliatelle #oxtailragu #pasta #sgfood #sgfoodies
I chose the bufala mozza as my appetizer and was surprised to see this huge plate of Parma ham and buffalo mozzarella served üòçüòç The portion allowed me to roll pieces of buffalo mozzarella in the Parma ham which is, I think, a good way to consume this dish. The ham was a tad salty but the clean mozzarella countered that well. Think there isn\'t too much of a good thing when it comes to ham and cheese. üòõüòõüòõ #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #osteriamozza #parmaham #buffalomozzarella #sgfood #sgfoodies

And, we certainly enjoyed the accompanying pur√©ed olives (tapenade) which complemented the homemade ricotta clouds perfectly.\n<br />~\n<br />Emilia-Romagna Regional Menu ($128++)
Such beautiful bite on the pasta and the dish benefits tremendously from the mild anise fragrant of the sausage. Ok, that\'s all.
Intense blast of #flavours! #osterriamozza #marinabaysands

Juicy medium rare steak topped with rocket leaves and slices of parmesan cheese. Warning: The steak has a bit strong hint of garlic. Delicious! 
Juicy and tender. Cooked with fennel onions, and sambuca.
