Sunday dim sum breakfast @ Chong Pang Market. I\'m quite surprised that the whole hawker is so crowded with long queues at some stalls.
[Chong Pang Market Food Centre] Forget about all the Korean bingsu or artisanal ice cream, there\'s one dessert that most Singaporeans grow up with and its cheap and widely available in hawker centres/food courts: ice kacang. For just $1.50 a bowl, you get a mountain of shaved ice with sugared syrup and a whole chunk of ingredients hidden beneath such as red beans, grass jelly and attap seeds. Over the years, there have been many creative variations by adding durian purée, mango ice cream, but to me, the traditional is and always will be the best. On a hot day, the alluring colours and icy cold goodies are just simply irresistible. I will choose a bowl of traditional ice kacang anytime and any day of the week. #hawkerpedia
Bought Pontian Wanton Mee and Soya Milk for breakfast today 😋 #cuisineparadiseeatout #burpple #breakfast
Super yummy with creamy and semi-sweet aftertaste. \n<br />#durian #burpple #cuisineparadiseeatout
Meaning I can start making durian puff, durian cake, durian rice and etc 😬. But before that let\'s feast on some first, all yellow meat ooooo only $2 each all good good bitter sweet taste de 😋😋😋 #cuisineparadiseeatout #durian #SG50signaturefood #Burpple
Breakfast for today is our usual local delight with: Fried carrot cake (white version), bee hoon and stir-fried glutinous rice (糯米饭). #cuisineparadiseeatout #burpple #SG50signaturefood
Located inside the food center, this Xiang Xiang fishball noodle has accompanied through my growing up years when I was staying in Yishun! The taste hasn\'t change much and it\'s still the same aunty doing the noodle. I wonder why she doesn\'t age... Noodle? 
Little do people know, there is a small stall in Chong Pang market selling delicious satay! They serve basically all kinds of meat of satay from pork to beef! The satay is sauce is simply irresistible! 
From a stall named Old Chong Pang. Pancake is pretty decent; light yet chewy with generous fillings of Red Bean that is sufficiently sweet. Great for a light breakfast in the area.
Was thinking of having some decent breakfast and thought of the HK-style Chee Cheong Fun that I had the other day. Went back to try the Zha Liang and must say that it\'s rather cute how the order is executed; the stall doesn\'t sell dough fritters so they actually purchase them from the stall next door when someone orders them! Because these dough fritters are made as grab-and-go snacks they felt a little thick and floury when wrapped within the Chee Cheong Fun. But the Chee Cheong Fun itself felt silkier than the ones the other day; probably because I visited them in the morning this time instead of late afternoon. Not to mention how they are ever generous with the soy sauce that even restaurants are scrimping on these days.
From a stall that says \"Hong Kong style Zhu Chang Fen\" that also sells noodles. Rice vermicelli is smooth but slightly on the thick side, but doused in enough soy sauce that makes it so flavourful its hard not to like. Shrimp was fine, nothing to shout about. Quite decent for hawker centre quality and satisfied my dim sum cravings; looking forward to their \"Zha Liang\" variant which is Rice Vermicelli wrapped with dough fritters inside!
From this stall named \"Oh My God!\" at Chong Pang Food Centre. This was in fact pretty decent considering a mix of meats only cost $3.50. Noodles were springy and coated with ample sauce and smothered with the honey sauce that also came on top of the meats. Roast Pork was pretty lean but the crisp skin made up for it, while the Charsiew was decent though would have preferred thicker slices. Would consider having this if dining at Chong Pang in the future.
Child hood favourite of all time! I used to come here every Sunday when I was little. Undoubtedly soft and silky 豆花. This stall runs for 3 generations. One small bowl will cure you of all troubles and worries. Not to mention its only 70 cents!
Stall #01-126 真品味. Prices start at $2.80 for a bowl of century egg &amp; lean meat congee. This stall sells a variety of congee. Some \"unusual\" congee include popcorn chicken congee, salmon congee, scallop congee, etc. They sell claypot pork liver &amp; frog leg too. Mixed pork congee (豬雜粥) at $3.50 with raw fish ($3/$5). The congee comes with 3 small deep-fried intestines. The deep fried intestines is over-fried thou\'. The congee is not the best but has this \"homely\" feel to it. Reasonably priced comfort food. I guess that explains the steady queue for the congee. 
The after dinner snack for most locals. Creamy texture, mozzarella cheese liked fibers. Taste good and always leaves you with a breath of memories the very next day. 
The maiden post of the series features Xiang Xiang Fishball Noodles (#01-177) at Chong Pang FC. Our #hawkerhopping SGAccountant weighs out the pros and cons - PROS: value for money ($3 for what would have been a $4 portion elsewhere; comes with 5 fishballs) + the handmade fishballs are fresh, springy and visibly larger + above average tasting overall. /// CONS: expect to queue for half an hour during peak hours + noodles are mildly soggy.
I can\'t rmb the stall\'s name but I thought this plate of $3.50 noodles is worth mentioning. I\'m really quite picky when it comes to whether the food is really good. This plate didn\'t disappoint me. It\'s full of gravy (I love) and the chilli is good (chilli lovers, you know how impt chilli is to the food!) each mouthful just makes me wanna eat more and more:) not too bad, but I do hope I can find even better hokkien mee out there! Do recommend me if you have any good ones! 😄
Noodles were springy and well-tossed in a balanced mix chili and ketchup that was enough for flavour. Fishballs were also \"q\". A bit stingy on the crispy and sinful lard but the fried shallots pretty much made up for it. Decent choice to have if in the market.
幼麵湯~~ Handmade noodles quite springy &amp; soup kinda flavorful, although I bet it\'s laden with MSG. Lol. Somehow I like the soup &amp; finished the whole bowl~ Don\'t feel thirsty yet... Hope I won\'t! Hahaha. PS: Uncle\'s really nice &amp; friendly. Keep thanking me profusely when he served me the noodles. I think he said like 5 times thank you? So cute. hehe! Stall Name: Nee Soon Fish Head Mee Hoon (# 01-154), Chong Pang Market &amp; Food Centre 
Got this from one of the bakeries in the neighborhood. $1.60 for a cupcake sized cake and the soft cake holds a sweet creamy strawberry filling inside. Really good! Comes in Vanilla too.
My cravings n this is gd..Oysters r big n juicy accordin to my cousy who ate with me. I dun take oyster though.
Wet market in Singapore is slowly becoming a thing in the past. Do you prefer supermarket instead?
Bedok Chwee Kueh for breakfast.
High 10!! Better than Kfc! Be Warned***Chilli r very Spicy!!!**
One of my favourite food; Fried hokkien mee with prawns. #burpple #dinner #food
Pork Satay @ Chong Pang FC. Amazingly tasty! The pork is filled with the oomph from the charcoal &amp; honey! And the sweet &amp; sour gravy is not bad too. Good good dinner though almost Yao Gah Pua Si.
Dumpling noodles from chong pang. Not really nice thou. Noodle okay,dumplings like okay also. Normal luh hahaha
今天的外卖是从家附近一间新开张的拉面小吃店买的, 汤头和肉都不错……\n<br />.\n<br />Lunch today is from a new ramen stall at our market area. The above cost $6.50 with 3 slices of tender chasu, runny egg, springy noodle, fish cake and bean sprout\n<br />.\n<br />Guess the only thing to improve is their noodle broth which could be better\n<br />.\n<br />#cuisineparadiseeatout #noodles #instagood #lunchideas #sgfoodie #burpple
The beehoon helps to fill the stomach up, which everything in overall, adds up to $8.20!

Odd-shaped fruit are likely to have fewer chambers inside thus fewer flesh-covered seeds.\n<br />.\n<br />TRICKS OF THE TRADE \n<br />There will be sellers try to push durians that were rejected by other customers. So Watch out for the vendors to ensure that they are opening a new durian.\n<br />.\n<br />SIZE MATTERS (Of course they do) \n<br />Different varieties of durians come in different sizes. XO durians are generally smaller while there Red Prawn durians are generally large. So be cautious if a seller points to a large XO durian or a small Red Prawn one.\n<br />.\n<br />TASTE TEST \n<br />Don\'t just prod the durian flesh, one should taste the durian. If it is bad, or not the variety promised, they are not obliged to buy it.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#durian #durianseason #maoshanwang #猫山王 #redprawn #greenbamboo #king #fruits #d24 #durianking #chongpang

The flavour of the noodles were further enhanced with the lime and sambal chilli, that gave it a more tangy taste!

Initially I suggested sharing a few dishes but he was hesitant as we usually have a bad habit of over-ordering and most of the time we are unable to finish our food. Since I was still deciding on what to eat and he already knew what to order, he went ahead first. Next thing I knew, he put this plate on the table with these exact same words with a smile - \"nah your favourite!\". Made me smile as well; because being a man of a few words, he never fail to use actions to show he cares 😘 Then again, actions always speaks louder than words 🤗\n<br />#8dayseat #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #eeeeets #exploresingaporeeats #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #foodstagram #igfood #instafood_sg #onthetable #openricesg #sgeats #sgfood #sgfooddiary #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodunion #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #singaporefoodies #sgig
今天我家厨房放假喔\n<br />.\n<br />Kitchen closed for tonight so above is our homely takeout from the hawker centre at below $15 for 3 pax. Hope you have a hearty dinner and enjoy the coming weekend. #asianfood #hawkerfood #sgfood #burpple #cuisineparadiseeatout
It\'s in situations like this when you learn to appreciate the freedom we have to go anywhere we want and have any food we like. The highlight here has got to be the Hokkien Mee. It\'s immersed in a rich broth with good Chilli on the side. Finished off the meal and with already full stomachs we shared a churro each. Awesome way to round off a shag day.
Lunch for today is mixed vegetable rice,  yong tao foo soup, tau suan and fried fritter 😋 #cuisineparadiseeatout #sgfood #sgfoodie #hawkerfood #burpple

Anyway, this Japanese cheesecake has the smoothest and lightest texture that I couldn\'t think of anyone who wouldn\'t like! Perfect for elderly and young children and office people because it\'s really a healthy dessert at only $8 for a whole cake!\n<br />#vscocam#vscosg#vscofood#foodvsco#feefeed#food52#onthetable#sgfood#sgeats#sgfoodie#sgcafe#sgcakes#japanesecheesecake#8dayseat#burpple
