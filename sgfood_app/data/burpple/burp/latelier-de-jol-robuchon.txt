Picasso\'s Blues - deep fried prawns flavoured with lavender. Crusty and chewy, with a sweet salted egg yolk-esque coating. Enjoyable while in the moment, but immediately forgotten once you\'re done with it, like a libertine\'s perfunctory fling at a sleazy lasub bar.
The Mona Lisa\'s. Beautifully filled with cheese and a dipping sauce to sweeten the taste. This is a favorite for frequent visitors to Museo and is a definite must try. Just like Mona, you\'ll definitely smile after eating this. 
Pomelo tea. It\'s mid week Wednesday and all you can think about is for the week to end so you can kick back and relax. But where you say? How about kicking back and relaxing with a pot of this unique drink? This blend of tea will definitely bring about a sense of refreshment
Museo (which means \'museum\' in Italian) is located in Sentosa\'s new restaurant strip, Quayside Isle, and combines casual fine dining with \"art jamming\". Couples can hold their solemnization ceremony outdoors at sunset with views of the marina, and their reception indoors in the restaurant and barroom. Smaller wedding parties of about 40 guests can opt for plated service while larger receptions of up to 130 guests will need to select their buffet service. 
Extra shot, \"blue mountain\" (extra oommph) cafe latte with vanilla syrup. Took them 1 spare and 1 explanation to barista to get it right.
Great view, nice tapas but meh mains. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com #sgfood #tea
If you want a romantic date with your loved one, you can enjoy sunset dining in the plush and luxurious setting, topped off with the perfect selection of house music and magnificent view of the marina littered with beautiful yachts, that is sure to put all stressed out souls at peace. Here\'s a photo of River Prawns and Linguine. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/museo/\n
Crispy soft shell crab with a chunky tomato-chilli sauce. Spicy, punchy, and really good.
Heartburn-inducing roast pork. I\'ll risk it. #roastpork #quaysideisle #museo #food
Nuggets of soft Camembert cheese encrusted with panko, deep-fried till golden, and served with cranberry sauce.
Battered prawns with a creamy, lavender-infused dip. The subtle floral taste lifts the greasiness of the deep-fried prawns. 
One of my favourite Chinese dishes - succulent roast pork belly with melt-in-the-mouth fat capped with crispy skin. 
Roasted Marinated Lamb Rack, served with Saut√©ed Arugula and Cherry Tomato Chutney
Deep-fried Camembert Cheese served with Cranberry Sauce

2 munchies: Imagine the moment the dish lands on the table, the first thing you notice is the layer of oil that sits at the bottom of the bowl. The Crispy Octopus was so greasy that there was hardly any crunch on the batter. Coated with salted egg butter sauce, I thought the salted egg flavour could have been more pronounced, though. In retrospect, perhaps not since the overall dish was already so heavy.

Away from the traditional Sri Lankan crabs that are used in this dish, you can certainly devoured this entire crab that has been deep fried and then poured with some of that chilli sauce.\n<br />_________________\n<br />MUSEO\n<br />Address: 31, Ocean Way, Sentosa Cove, Quayside Isle, Unit 01-22, Singapore 098375\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #restaurantsg #srf2017 #singaporerestaurantfestival

Charmed by the intimate atmosphere they create, I found that Museo‚Äôs dining-in-a-cup concept not only injects a sense of novelty but also presents a¬†feast for both the eyes and the palate.¬†An elegant and stunning display, the luxurious mess created as the¬†warm butterscotch sauce melts away and reveal the hidden cold treat enclosed within¬†the chocolate sphere was simply lip smacking. Topped with an intriguing choice of popping candy, the slowly collapsing ball cleverly sits on a slightly dense sponge that soaks up all the rich goodness of the sauce. There was also a citrus tinge to the butterscotch which went really well with the other¬†elements. Needless to say, anything that combines hot, cold and the sweet is always good!
Ok, that\'s all.

// The {Soft Shell Chilli Crab} ($14) introduces hunky masses of soft shell crab lightly doused in a sweet and savoury tomato chilli sauce. This one had crunch but lacked the depth to draw references to as a chilli crab dish
The harmonious combination of olive oil, garlic, parsley and chilli padi singing a happy tune when tossed thru the angel hair pasta perforated with tons of crab meat
In this frame is Foie Gras Terrine, a t¬≠asty and ornate dish that resembles a beautiful garden, complete with cute mini bla¬≠ck \"garden forks\". @museo_sg new menu will be launched tomorrow üòã More on the blog soon :) #museo #Arteastiq #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #awesome #whatiate #burpple #openricesg #sgeats #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger #fooddiaries #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore
Not a dish to be overlooked as the inclusion of seaweed introduces some exciting vibes to the conventional salmon and cream cheese combo

Meltingly tender with such robust flavor snuck in between the joints
We ordered from a menu of interestingly-named dishes which came with an impressive presentation: A Sunday Afternoon On The Island (chicken satay), Three Musicians (soft shell chilli crab), The Kiss (BBQ squid), Picasso\'s Blue (deep fried prawns), Pu-er Tea that came with spicy cookies and pineapple juice.

Too good to describe
A citrusy cocktail that, unlike its name suggests, is light and quite refreshing, not cloyingly sweet.
