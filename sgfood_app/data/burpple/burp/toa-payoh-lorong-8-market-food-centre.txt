Love shen mian soup since I was a kid. It\'s yellow noodles but without the strong alkaline taste, the texture is just like al dente fresh pasta. There aren\'t many in Singapore I believe. This is as good as it can be.
The hunt for an authentic bowl of chendol on Labour Day took longer than expected. First stop was Dove desserts but sadly it was closed. And knowing our luck with hawker stalls, we were all ready to settle for nearby Creamier. But lo and behold it was open! Beautiful pale hues of Pandan green buried under a dome of shaved ice, none of those radioactive green worms we are so used to. They also run a cheng tng stall in the same hawker centre, but HS said it doesn\'t beat his favourite Adam one. Nothing\'s better than any icy dessert in our balmy weather☺️
Must have to get when eating here! This $2 bowl of chendol was awesome. Light coconut milk with gula melaka that wasn\'t saccharine. The highlight for me was the soft and fragrant pandan jelly noodles, which had me wanting more!
So much fresh seafood in one plate! Love the saltiness of the pork lard with the flavourful broth. The beehoon had a slight wok hei to it. It got more and more bland but it was better with the soy sauce chilli mixed in.
4 munchies: One look and you know the stock has got to be rich and flavourful. Starting from $5 a plate, the rice vermicelli is wok-charred before braising in the subtly sweet seafood stock. Featured here is the $20 version that comes with crayfish, ocean prawns and lala. Had the broth been slightly thickened and redolent with egg drops, it would have been mind-blowing.
The epitome of gluttony. 😆😆😆 (Date: 29 December 2015 Tuesday) #oysteromelette #fatdieme
Honestly, damn shiok. The portion is great, generous on the meat, til I can\'t finish my bowl (maybe I am just simply a small eater that day). The starchy beef sauce is light, compliments and not overpowering. The soup, is earthy, beefy, and gorgeously robust. Worth those calories. 😋
A nice icy ending after stuffing ourselves full of delicious hawker food and cakes.\n<br />The green jelly in Chendol still reminds me of slimy green tentacles and I say no to attap chee! 🙅 But the shaved ice with Gula Melaka and red beans are nice in this dessert.
A splash of coconut milk, atapchi, Pandan \"worm\" jelly and that scoop of thick homemade gula melaka 😻 (a great recommendations from fellow #BurppleTastemaker @jacqsowhat!)
Honestly, where can you find $2 hawker food anymore? Places like these are so rare already, and what makes it more rare is the fact that these balls are so good. QQ and \"crunchy\" and the mere fact that the store still sells each bowl at $2,   The store seriously deserve all the Recognition and applause. There is a reason why people don\'t mind queuing up for their simple bowls of goodness!  
Lor bee Hoon - nice n soft bee Hoon , flavourful ingredients ! Cheap n gd n authentic! 
Late dinner and back to my favorite carrot cake!l stall. Just $2.50!🍴
The succulent meat is not too salty and not too heavily seasoned, which is a good thing as I can taste the natural sweetness of the duck meat.  Thumbs up! (Date: 9 September 2015 Wednesday)
Only $2.50! Super value for money. (Date: 9 September 2015 Wednesday)
Yummy Wanton Noodles from Hougang Meng Kee Wanton Noodle.  Only $2.50! Super value for money.  (Date: 9 September 2015 Wednesday)

These hand made fish balls are the bomb man! Soft yet Q (i know they are pictured at the far end),  the extra Ngog Hiong I added was pretty decent too at an extra $1. However, the noodles were a far cry from both of them.
Got this from 大巴窑剪刀剪咖喱饭. Rice and soft vege blanketed by a glistening layer of curry and sauce. (The curry actually looks redder in real life) Was having an internal debate when choosing the meat. Couldn\'t decide between the healthier braised chicken or the sinful sweet &amp; sour pork. In the end the devil won. Glad I chose sweet and sour pork, curry rice with crispy sweet and sour pork. Yum
There are many good Hokkien Mee stalls in Serangoon area, most would say Chomp Chomp. This stall originate from a coffee shop just across Chomp Chomp which later got occupied by NTUC. It was through a good friend that I found this stall again. The taste is simply......上汤有虾味，猪油渣好香，米粉面搭配好，够湿...一句话-👌 a simple meal I personally crave every week ;)) verdict: 4.5/5
A snaking queue can almost always be seen at the Heng Kee Prawn Noodle and Laksa stall. It might surprise you that this stall doesn\'t have newspaper clippings or award certificates plastered all over their front and yet still have so many people lusting after their food. Maybe the people at Toa Payoh want to keep it a secret. But the absence of accolades on display doesn\'t make the food any less delicious. \"Mee Pok Dry, extra chilli, extra noodles\", my order whenever I visit. Fresh prawns, lean slices of pork, bean sprouts, perfectly cooked eggy meepok and a spicy chilli sauce. Let\'s not forget the flavourful bowl of prawn soup that comes with the noodles. A perfect way to start the morning indeed.
Yummy hearty meal to chase away the Monday Blues. 
Had my favorite Carrot Cake so today\'s gonna be a great day!
taro ball grass jelly

Curry Rice $3 | Pig Trotters $5 | Eating good and eating cheap(: #postworkout #recovery
not nice! not enough fish meat to bring out the tasty flavour. tasteless soup…
Fish balls n fish cake are nice but the noodle is disappointing.
Wanted my Fan Choy from this Hawker Centre but the stall wasn\'t open. Nonetheless, this Prawn Noodles were light and springy(:
Just some casual Saturday #liftingnoodles
I prefer carrot cake dryer, with the egg fried to a crisp and radish pieces lightly burnt around the edges, giving a nice smokey aroma + crispy texture of fried korea pancake to the dish. And not to forget the generous amount of chye poh embedded within! Ah, the perfect breakfast food.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgig #handsinframe #vscosg #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodporn #sydneyfood #foodporn #buzzfeast #foodphotography #sgfood #f52grams #bestfoodworld #foodstagram #beautifulcuisines #whati8today #breakfast #whyteworks #foodphotography #buzzfeast #yahoofood #followforfollow #icecream #appetitejournal #tablesituation #foodiegram #streetfood #hkeats #like4like #burpple
With lots of ingredients, it was tasty without the sweetness of the usual dark soy sauce. Added a fried oyster omelette which was nostalgic in flavour.
🍧\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: At 💵S$2 this is by far the best Chendol you can ever get. Every ingredient in this bowl is indeed as fresh as it gets. Especially the Red Bean, one bite &amp; you know this ain’t those pathetic ones from the depth of the god forsaken tin cans. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />The Chendol Strips has an aromatic Pandan that pairs so well with the Fresh Coconut Milk &amp; Gula Melaka. Sweet but not overpowering, you can add on almost every ingredient at 💵S$0.50. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #SugarCakePie #Chendol #Desserts #GulaMelaka #CoconutMilk #fourseasonschendol #fourseasonschingteng
The noodles comes with Chinese sausages, vegetables, bean sprouts, egg and fish cakes, which in overall wasn\'t too oily to have!

Opening time state 4pm - 9pm, however it was closed every time I reached ;( finally got to try it yesterday....long queue smacked in the middle of the hawker centre. I was the lucky few just in time before it sells out at 6.45pm. A extremely simple dish, just vermicelli, stock, cray fish, prawns, pipi and bring to heat. I guessed the draw was a dish not usually found in hawker centre. It doesn\'t come cheap $5/$8/$12 for prawns &amp; pipi while $15/$20/$25 for cray fish. Actual operating hours: 4.15pm till max 6.45pm. In comparison to Sembawang White Bee Hoon (although not totally similar because of seafood mainly here) I find the taste bland. Will I come queue just for this? No not again, but it\'s worth killing your own curiosity. ;p Yumminess: 2.5/5
Simple but fresh Seafood White Bee Hoon.
The mee sua has soaked up the tasty seasoning sauce, which made every mouthful of it so enjoyable to the palate. #meesua #palatepleaser
Look at that thick homemade gula Melaka 😍 #hawkerpedia

Once again, I shall bore you with this new find. This one has Lup Cheong and fried Lard pieces inside. Overall, it was average.
This stall has a unique clear sauce, compared to the usual dark sauce.
