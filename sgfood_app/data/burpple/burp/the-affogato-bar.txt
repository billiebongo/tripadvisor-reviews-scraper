Was a little early for school and decided to drop by for some bakes since it is been a while since my last visit to Crown Bakery &amp; Cafe.
Crispy bagel with smoked salmon, ricotta cheese and sprouts. Pot of pear oolong tea
Yes please! No shoddy rendition here at @crownbakery, especially so with an epic croissant to boot. Satisfaction guaranteed, bet you don\'t hear that too often now.
The French toast itself was the crowning glory (ahem - painful pun Editor) with its soft fluffiness akin to the lovely coats of the many dogs you\'d spy walking their human angmohs if you dine here al fresco, whilst elsewhere the characteristically grainy pear was almost an apple doppelgänger and the bacon strips were of the jaw-trigger happy, hard and chewy variety. 3.8/5
Nicest bagel I had in a while. The smoked salmon was pretty standard, but I was blown away by its plain bagel. Really soft inside, but the best part was the crunchy outer. Every mouth I took had an audible crunch.  Crown bakery is well known for their extremely crisp buttery croissants as well, which I have yet to try, but hope to someday.
A quaint cafe at the corner of Crown Centre decked out in French blue and white hues, even with the tea and coffee sets (wouldn\'t mind getting one set myself, it\'s such a pretty shade), Crown Bakery serves up French-inspired Japanese breads, hence giving rise to items such as sweet potato loaf and mentaiko mayo crisp aside from the traditional sourdough and croissants. They have a small dine-in area where patrons can either enjoy goods from the counter or their food menu.\n<br />:\n<br />Having been a fan of Ronin\'s French toast, this makes me waver with the fluffy marshmallow-like brioche and adequate syrup drizzle, which Ronin sometimes gets a bit too heavy-handed on. It may be called candied chewy bacon, but there were still some crisp corners in the two bacon slices, and had some delicious smokiness beneath the sweet coat. The roast pear, which I thought will be mildly sweet, actually had a spice profile - I think clove? Now the only thing this dish needs more of is EGG on the brioche, which sadly isn\'t sold at the bakery section??
Ordered the crown breakfast ($29) which was huge!!! Came with the fragrant Crown Puff Pastry that tasted like palmier biscuits accompanied by a runny sunny side up, tender red wine-braised oxtail, cheesy sausage, bacon, sautéed mushrooms, baked tomato and salad! Also tried their Hainanese chicken bread ($4.80) which had chicken chunks in it!!! Yums :)  
$6.90 if you pair it with a coffee or tea. The croissant was amazing because of the flaky crust which made it taste so crispy when you bite into it. The inside was soft while the outside was crispy, making it a perfect combination. Putting butter made it even better because the croissant was hot, allowing the butter to melt. One of the best croissants that I have tasted!! It was something special because the croissant had 27 layers apparently and I guess this is their signature.
Caught them at closing time so this might not be the prettiest flat white (?) But it was good for my soul while it lasted. Will get to that macaron croissant after i burn me some excess calories. Tomorrow.
That flaky crown centerpiece with the runny yolk, Canadian back bacon, umami explosions in the sautéed mushrooms, the huge chicken sausage and that red wine oxtail... Oooooh that oxtail. Makes me weak in the knees ~ (7.7/10)
Soft, pillowy bread with bits of red bean! I have matcha spread at home just for moments like this haha. A tad bit pricey for such a SMOL loaf, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. 
Don\'t hate me when I say this but - I am not a croissant person. I do not comprehend why people like croissants when they can eat cake (Uber sweet-tooth here 🙋🏻) But this croissant didn\'t fail to disappoint me and left me satisfied by the layers of flaky pastry. Would have been better if warmed up tho, but I just dug into temptation and ate without thinking. 
In the foreground is the Koji &amp; Tokachi Red Bean Anpan, while the Koji &amp; Purple Yam Anpan is at the back. Of the lot, I prefer the Yam one more; the light bite-sized bun comes with light bread crumbs over the top for a crunchy sensation, while the insides are filled with mashed yam – not totally smooth but a little chunky without having to bite, filled with earthy flavour. The Red Bean Anpan features toasty sesame seeds atop the same light bun, and the red bean filling was mashed similarly in the way that the yam was, with chunks of chopped red bean within and was also pretty earthy exuding its natural flavours.
This is the definition of love. HAHA!
A pretty good tea break bread to enjoy with light teas on a leisurely afternoon. Good for sharing, or ideally so because the loaf comes in five segments, each coming off neatly when torn apart. While the top carries a subtle sweetness, I liked the roasty flavour of the sesame seeds atop, while the sweetness of the soft sweet potato chunks comes afterwards. Inside, it reveals a flaky interior that is lightly subtle, which rounded the bread off with a good combination of sweet and savoury.
New \'kid\' on the bukit timah block (since april 2015) featuring wide varieties of bread and pastries which some are quite interesting. Worth to sniff it out.
Hehehe @krezhong and I ordered the Crown Breakfast ($29) which had the yummiest red wine-braised oxtail! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 We paired it with their slightly sweet cold brew coffee that had hints of chocolate and wine! 🍷 T\'was a good monthiversary meal! ❤️❤️❤️ #burpple
Don\'t leave your granny unsupervised with the stollen, or you may return to find a most coquettish giggling schoolgirl.
I shared them with my colleague and he wants to make a trip there to buy them😊 (these are just a quarter of the actual size) \n<br />➊ [Gugelhupf S$28] - Valrhona chocolate, raisins, strawberries laced with Jamaican rum and finished with a drizzle of icing. \n<br />➋ [Panettone S$38] - raisins and candied orange peels with hints of V.S.O.P. brandy, Jamaican rum and white wine. Soft &amp; fluffy! \n<br />➌ [Stollen S$33] - nutty walnuts, macadamia, almonds, raisins, cranberries laced with creme de cassis, liqueur, red wine, topped with powered sugar. If I have to choose a favourite, it will be this❣
And finally we got to try on this cafe. Ordered Crown Breakfast ($29) for my love. The highlights, Crown Puff pastry with sunny side up masterpiece and red wind-braised oxtail. Both are seriously delicious. And Maple-Banana French Toast ($12) for me. Hard to say no next time after you try this. And Piccolo Latte ($2.25). 
A baby latte of piccolo coffee to jump start the day. You need to like strong coffee to enjoy this. 
French toast topped with fresh bananas, strawberries and raisins, then drizzled with 100% pure maple syrup and served with a scoop of ice cream. Obviously I took too long to take a picture that the ice cream started melting. \n<br />On a side note, so glad that O Level oral exams are finally over! I can now catch up on my piles of marking 📝. And just want to thank those who participated in my giveaway! I\'ve messaged the winners privately.
Definitely a platter to share among two or more, the Crown Breakfast is a little steep on the dollars at $29. On a sizeable wooden chopping board, the platter comes with various goodies - back bacon, chicken sausage, red wine-braised oxtail, baked tomato, sauteed mushrooms, some greens and the notable crown shaped puff pastry with a sunny side up egg in the middle. A pretty good bang for your buck, the oxtail was well-braised, succulent and tender. The puff pastry was really good too as it was crisp, buttery and flaky which goes with the yolk of the sunny side up. Crown Bakery is a place I will see myself returning to for high tea and their bakes, albeit the slightly pricey tag.
What, the jubilee weekend is coming to an end?! Can we rewind, pleeeeeeease? 😩 .
Late brunch situation today. The breads here are really power, especially the unique Hainanese chicken bread, which is studded with pieces of chicken and comes with an accompanying chilli dip.
Is an item under the kid\'s menu that adults can order too! Sunny side up egg and bacon on fluffy sourdough english muffin, is just so appealing especially when served with a side of red cabbage coleslaw. Portion might be small since it\'s for kids, but it gave us an excuse to try other items like 27-layer croissant!
We decided to have the Tuna Mayo Croissant Sandwich ($14), Bacon &amp; Egg Muffin ($5.90) and Pain Au Chocolat ($3.20). Paired with a Iced latte ($6) or a pot of English Breakfast ($5) to complete our meal!
Come here without expecting much and perhaps you might find this a perfect treat; their rendition of French Toast seemed to be more similar to mum\'s recipe at home. Bread dipped in eggs wash absorbed the awesomeness within, while lightly drizzled in maple syrup with berries sprinkled atop, and slices of bananas trying to steal the berry\'s show. Vanilla ice-cream was aromatic, but the occasional ice bit interrupted the otherwise smooth texture. Still, a satisfying dessert that is more homely than gastronomically outstanding.
Crown bakery &amp; Cafe is located at the crown centre, at bukit Timah, and their dine-in menu is only available from 9.30am onwards even though the bakery opens at 7.30am. It was a scorching hot morning and outside seating is hell, but indoors seating is quite limited. Food was not as good as expected with its egg benz too salty and waffle too soft/soggy (not the crispy-outside-fluffy-inside kind of waffle, plus the taste was abit weird) The only thing I liked most was the earl pear bread pudding, which was fragant with every bite. Items featured in the picture include: Royal Eggs Royale $19/Crown sourdough buttermilk  waffles with ice cream and fruits $9/Earl pear bread pudding $12. Verdict: Dine-in food I had for some was quite disappointing. But you might still want to give their better known breads a try. 3.50/5.0.
Crown Breakfast, a big breakfast platter to share, sunny side up egg with a crown puff, with red wine-braised oxtail, chicken sausage, back bacon, sauteed mushrooms, baked tomato &amp; a side of salad. The oxtail was fall off the bone tender, an extra side of bread would have been perfect! 
Dark chocolate croissant with berries filling, what a great combination of flavours all together. With the creme topping before baked, similar to almond croissant, resulted of the lacking of crunchy texture, but still oh so very good! 👍🏼😋
Back at the Crown Bakery with the queen to try some of the new brunch plates and desserts recently launched. Featuring the Maple Banana French Toast topped with fresh strawberries, raisins and a scoop of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream on the side.
Because it\'s the weekends and it\'s never complete without breakfast! Try the special Sourdough Waffles by Crown Bakery. It actually works pretty well! Of course, gotta get their NZ cream cheese Danish, matcha brioche... More on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio.
Got a SIGNATURE [Hainanese Chicken Bread S$4.50] - think chicken rice in a loaf. Not just artificial flavouring, it\'s made from chicken soup, skinless chicken thigh, garlic, ginger and shallots. Chicken rice garlic chili will be given for every Hainese Chicken Bread, but I decided to try it with Thai chili, nah, chicken rice chili still goes best with this! 😍😍
Queen\'s Eggs Benedict was alright. The coffee was well made and refreshing, not so special though. Hope it could be better because their prices are steep! Not pictured is their Artisanal breads which have earned quite a stellar reviews (and indeed they are true). Café is a bit cramped but there are plenty of spaces to sit outside.
Why not try @crownbakery\'s variant of Hainanese Chicken Bread - fluffy soft bread filled with chunks of succulent chicken thighs. Oh, and finish off with a spicy dose of the accompanying chili!
At $29, this breakfast platter is one of the most expensive around. But don\'t be too quick to judge, because it gives you a pretty good bang for your buck. A generously sized chopping board of various meats and eggs, this is good for two to share. I loved the flakey pastry in particular, that came with a beautiful sunny side up egg encased within 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I don\'t think the matcha brioche here deserves to be their signature though. Their Hainanese chicken rice bread tho.... that deserves some medals right there. Innovative concept and brilliant execution. #marshmunch #burpple
Coming back to enjoy the ambience of this bakery (and the food of course). The brioche was a perfection; slightly buttery and eggy, its texture is a mix of pastry and bread. The Shizuoka matcha, as my foodie buddy also pointed out, could have been stronger in taste. Yet, my tea-time companion today loves the matcha \"paste\", saying that it is \"one of the best matcha in Singapore\" since it\'s neither too sweet nor too bitter. I guess it\'s just my tastebuds getting harder to please.
Eggs ben royale was delicious, much better than many other lacklustre eggs ben that did not flow. 
*pardon the ugly photo*\n<br />Decided to take-away this baguette simply because the word \"mentaiko\" attracted me. Personally, I found the bread was a tad too hard to bite (not soggy, just plain hard) despite having obediently followed the re-heating instructions behind the paper bag. That aside, I love the fusion of garlic and mentaiko on top of the bread. Such a generous amount of mentaiko in every bite I took, with a heavy taste of mayonnaise as well. Really filling to have it for breakfast.
Finally make my way to have this. Totally worth the trip and their latte is nice.
Finally tried Crown Bakery! Earl pear bread pudding and matcha brioche.
Crown Bakery, one of the latest cafe at Bukit Timah offers a wide array of bread and pastries, all day breakfasts including this one &amp; only sourdough buttermilk waffle that\'s crisp and featherlight with a delightful mild tang.
The item I love the most becos it taste the best! 😄😋
We enjoyed the signature Crown Breakfast, which features an impressive array of ingredients. Highlights include the red wine braised oxtail, and the majestic Crown Puff Pastry. Be sure to try their Matcha Brioche as well, it was simply divine!
The Hainanese Chicken Rice Bread did not meet my expectations with its so-so flavours but kudos to the bread texture (crusty yet soft inside). For Mentaiko fans, try the Mentaiko Garlic Toast, it\'s da bomb! 
Interestingly situated at Crown Centre, Crown Bakery &amp; Cafe offers an extensive selection of bread and pastries such as ciabattas, brioches and croissants, alongside a small selection of brunch items. Go for their massive Crown Breakfast ($29) which generously comprises of a soft, buttery Crown Puff Pastry with sunny side egg, red wine braised oxtail, chicken sausage, Canadian back bacon, baked tomato and sautéed mushrooms. To go, grab the innovative Hainanese Chicken Bread ($4.50) made from chicken soup, skinless chicken thigh, garlic, ginger and shallots. It\'s quite literally chicken rice in bread form — it even comes with a spicy, tangy chilli sauce!
In fact everyone should, this will make earth a better place 😇 •\n<br />[The Queen\'s Eggs Ben S$18] - poached eggs &amp; finely shaved honey baked ham sitting on top of Crown\'s fluffy sourdough English muffin, drizzled with smooth creamy hollandaise sauce and served with a side of mesclun. Other 2 choices are salmon &amp; spinach. Available daily from 9.30am!
Earl Grey Cashew Brioche from Crown Bakery made with Japanese wheat flour, French butter and a whole lot of goodness.
Easily one of my favourite items available here. First bite it actually does not hit off; the intense and sharp flavours of Earl Grey Tea just does not hit something that was supposed to be rather light yet sweet tasting. As one digs through to the bottom, it gets really fragrant, with a bit of custard-like flavours starting to surface. Hidden within was the poached pears, soft and crunchy. A well put together and innovative creation that I would find myself ordering yet again during my revisit.
Breakfast platter that comes with various goodies so it\'s best shared between two or three. For most parts it\'s pretty decent, with cheese sausage, bacon, sautéed mushrooms, tomato, Crown Puff Pastry, Mesculun salad and braised oxtail. Highlights for me was the tomato which was juicy and tangy; very fresh, sautéed mushrooms which was juicy and flavourful with its earthiness, the oxtail which was surprisingly tender and not forgetting the Crown Puff Pastry; shaped in their logo with an egg in the middle with runny yolk that is crisp and flaky.
Brioche was surprisingly light and fluffy, but what makes this so good was the intense bitter matcha flavours which was evident throughout. This is was so good it makes for a nice tea time snack just by itself!
Kaori Ciabatta: A soft, fluffy bread that tastes like a cross between mee chiam kueh (peanut pancake, without the peanut) and Chinese white honeycomb cake (白糖糕) from coffeeshops. Went delightfully well with sweet jams.
🎉👏🏻👏🏻 spend above S$5 and get a 27-layer croissant for just S$1! \n<br />This is something I really like! [Earl Pear Bread Pudding S$12] - fragrant pears poached in whole Earl grey tea leaves, surrounded with Earl grey creme anglaise and lightly dusted with Earl grey snow to enliven its buttery-citrusy flavours.
This was great! I really liked the texture of the waffles though they were really stingy on the berries huh. The ice cream was slightly icey but nothing a copious amount of maple syrup can\'t fix. Haha. A good treat :-)
Crown Breakfast ($29) - Comprising of red wine braised oxtail that is so tender 😍😍😍, chicken sausage, Canadian back bacons, baked tomato and sautéed mushrooms. Not forgetting the buttery Crown Puff Pastry as the centre piece, where you can dip into the yolk of the sunny side up. Every part of this dish just taste so good! Perfect for the royalty!
Featuring one of their signature Hainanese Chicken Bread, best savoured with garlicky chicken rice chili, even the little one also love it!
The Crown Breakfast - With a crown puff centrepiece, dip it in the yolk of the sunny side up, and let its butteriness meld with creamy gooeyness. Extend the royal spread with red wine-braised oxtail, chicken sausage, Canadian back bacon, sauteed mushrooms, baked tomato &amp; a side of mesclun with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. 
This new bakery-cafe totally got me excited with their scrumptious baked goods, pretty presentation and competitive pricing. This is Matcha Brioche ($3.20) made with Japanese wheat flour, French butter, key ingredients and pure matcha imported from Shizuoka prefecture of Japan, known for producing the finest tea.
Not forgetting red wine-braised oxtail, chicken sausage, Canadian back bacon, sautéed mushrooms, baked tomato and a side of mesclun with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Fit for a royal 👸🏻\n<br />⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />Opens on 29th April 2015. Available daily from 9.30am onwards!
The perfect Crown Breakfast that\'s fit for any king and queen or even for sharing, comprising a sunny side up puff pastry centerpiece, red wine braised oxtail, chicken sausage, Canadian back bacon, sautéed mushroom, baked tomato and mesclun salad.
While I have my reservations about the inclusion of the oxtail (suitably tender, but methinks it’s too much meat on mah plate), this was nonetheless the perfect brunch platter for two on a weekend morning. Haughtily basking in the limelight (and rightfully claiming the throne) is the Crown Puff Pastry, a magically flaky and buttery triumph of a puff pastry so memorable, your lips will whimper yearnfully for more in-mouth buttery melt-age for days after. Kudos all round to everybody else – from the absolutely massive chicken sausage stick that you can use for mini golf to the smoky bacon and plump juicy mushrooms, this breakfast is a spectacular winner. 4.4/5 
Bite into this soft and fluffy [Shizuoka Matcha Brioche S$3.20] - Shizuoka matcha, Japanese wheat flour, natural leaven, French butter, almond powder, almond flakes, eggs, sugar and sea salt. (Opens 29th April 2015)
Pictured are the Shizuoka Matcha Brioche, Choco Berry Imperial Seal and Macaron Croissant. Man, some of the breads here (such as the Hainanese Chicken Bread served with chilli) are quite the revelation.
So stuffed in a bread marathon earlier, but the deep-rooted gluttony told us that we need to try the sourdough buttermilk waffle at Crown Bakery &amp; Cafe, a new and exciting concept that will be coming to you in just a week\'s time.
Here\'s a piece of [Macaron Croissant S$4.20] - freshly baked buttery croissant topped with roasted hazelnuts which added crunch to every bite and dusted with icing sugar. 😛 Have a sweet Monday morning like this croissant ❤️\n<br />⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />@CrownBakerySG opens its doors on 29th April 2015!

Easily one of the best eggs benedict I ever had! 👍
Thus we ended up here.

Good place to chill in a cafe with amazing coffee. Also, they have a wide range of breads and pastries which you could choose from. The price are rather affordable too. Some of the special food that they have include the macaron croissant, cinnamon roll, matcha azuki loaf. Visit the bakery &amp; cafe to see more of what they have to offer! Overall, a relaxed and comfortable place to chill. Service staff were friendly as well.
first time having chicken rice bread, for that matter lol. quite nice actually! happy Sunday everyone ☺️✌🏼️#food #breakfast #weekend #burpple
Fluffy! Forget about maple syrup or the ice cream. It is already tasty by its own! Will be back to try their bread and pastry which are freshly bake. \n<br />P.S. Hmm... Could sour dough be the next revolution ? \n<br />#eltonventure #sgmakandiary #sg #exploresingapore #whatieat #sgfood #sgfoodies #burpplesg #burpple

A dirrtyyy picture of the flaky pastry melded with smudgings of melted dark and white choc chunks with hunks of VSOP brandy-soaked raisins piled up in the middle.

😳 #lame\n<br />|\n<br />{27 layer croissant} - lamination at its best with 3 letter folds to achieve this perfect balance of bread and butter. // Definitey one of the best croissant I\'ve had on our local shores。
Needless to say; the almond version was exemplary albeit for the unnecessary excessive hand of icing sugar over the top。

It isn\'t your normal crispy &amp; flurry #buttermilkwaffle but instead it is not crispy, chewy &amp; slightly dense. But it still smell just as good and the tasted great! Very flavourful &amp; textured! If you are able to get pass your usual impression of a buttermilk #waffle, you will surely enjoy it!
as usual for a bakery cafe, #crownbakerycafe don\'t really has good coffee. But at least their breads are really good!

The flavour is so on point, meat very tender and soft it literally melts in your mouth. The strawberry dessert pastry was a complete miss though #crownbakery #wewantsugar #cafehoppingsg #eatandbrunch #8dayseat #burpple #sgcafefood #instafoodsg

But how can you say no to great food?
A tad overprice. Go for their breads and pastries instead!
Hainanese Chicken Rice Bread: underwhelming! Had high expectations, but the taste was bland. There were generous chicken chunks that were tender. Best part was probably the chilli. For $4.20, it\'s not that worth it? Garlic Mentaiko Bread: my favourite out of the 3. I don\'t know if it\'s because it\'s stale, the bread was super hard even for a garlic bread. But the taste is good, mentaiko flavour was strong and went well with the garlic. 
Earl pear bread pudding, a pretty innovative dish but the idea of pear and tea just did not went in sync.
Looks good &amp; crusty. Very few pieces of chicken inside. Personally like it with slightly more salt &amp; more moist. Best to dip in chilli sauce #breads #breadlovers #cafehopping #chicken #openrice #burpple
