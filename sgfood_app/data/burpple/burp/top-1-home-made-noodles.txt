It is an unassuming plate of noodles, but it really hits home. The noodles are all handmade, and there is a variety for you to choose from (mee hoon kuay etc). This time I ordered the meatball version, but there is also a sliced fish version. And the best part? That bowl of soup in the left hand corner. I have no idea what stock it is but it\'s a rich cloudy-clear soup, and it\'s awesome. 🙆🏻 #igfood #igeats #foodislife #foodislove #goodfood #burpple #burppleSG #sgfood #sgeats #singapore #yummy #noodles #hawkerfinds

Chilli was very spicy...got the \"oomph\". Very tasty. No wonder long queue..at least a 30min wait but i was lucky. Got mine in 5 secs cos someone infront of me didnt want spicy. Owner gave me a big smile n said \"girl, u vy heng ah\" &amp; i said \"uncle...1st time\'s the charm\" (me grinning away). $3.50 only😏#noodles #noodlelover #lunch #hawkerfood #burpple #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #stfoodtrending #singaporefood #igers #sgig #sgfoodies #bloggersg #singaporeinsiders #instafood
