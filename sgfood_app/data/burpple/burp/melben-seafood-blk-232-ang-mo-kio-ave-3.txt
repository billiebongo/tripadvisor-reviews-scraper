The sauce is like a thicker, more buttery version of the soup. Super shiok, but you\'ll probably get gelard if you eat too much. Eat this then wash it down with the soup.
This was extremely filling for 2 guys and 2 girls. Well also because we added extra soup and vermicelli. üôä Can\'t believe the queue was still crazy long on a weekday night! Although we reserved the table for 8pm. We still had to wait an hour before the food came. Maybe this is their strategy, make you wait really long so that when you taste the food it just taste really good üòÇ
Can\'t believe this is the first time I\'m visiting mellben. This claypot soup is the bomb. Milky, buttery, fragrant with that slight spice due to the ginger. Seriously couldn\'t stop slurping it down though I was so full I was going to explode üòÇ
The soup is really really savoury. Try to match it with other dishes which are not creamy to balance the taste. Put the bee hoon bit by bit
When you can taste the freshness and essence of the wonderful crab in the broth, you know that it is money and calories well spent.
This is probably the best crab I\'ve eaten especially being cooked in the laksa!
A tasty golden colored soup, combine with mouth-friendly (cut-up) glass noodle is just the beginning. Have a taste of the soup first, follow by a spoonful of noodle to whet the appetite. Once that is done, all hands will be required for the main - HUGE crab. What awaits you after you\'ve peel off the hard shells, is the juicy white meat, full of sweetness and favor. There is clearly no waiting for others, as winner takes all! Warning: Expect to wait an hour plus and huge crab does comes with a hefty price tag - $80. I must admit I forgot about the wait once I start eating. Worth a try! Rating: 4 heartbeat out of 5. 
Mellben needs no introduction to all crab lovers. The crab bee hoon has addictively rich, creamy sauce that keeps people coming back for more, despite the insanely long queues. Besides the excellent crab, go for the Salted Egg Pork Ribs, and Salad You Tiao. Don\'t forget to order some greens to balance this meal ;) Make reservations ahead of time to avoid queuing for 2 hours!
Yummy crab bee hoon soup at Mellben Seafood (Ang Mo Kio). The crab is differentiated by weight. You will have to decide on the size and number of crabs when you make you order. Do take note that it\'s really crowded. So it\'s best to make a reservation, or to before dinner time, as the queue can be very long. 
Celebrating the dad\'s birthday wolfing down the largest pincer ever. Super shiok and succulent!
Gooood but pricey 
yes, i craved for crabs; but... we overkilled again. 2 salted egg crabs, 2 chilli crabs, 1 huge beehoon soup crabs. it\'s a crabby business @ the famous mellben seafood place. üíÄ

This is Mellben Seafood\'s signature Claypot Crab Bee Hoon Soup. It is so popular that additional soup and bee Hoon is limited to one portion per table. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
