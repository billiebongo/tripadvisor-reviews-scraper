|\n<br />Bacon, Onion and Cheese baked under 180degree Celsius. Look at the picture, and it will explain everything.
|\n<br />A Friday morning required such comfort. Dipped the crispy bread sticks into the heart warming molten cheese and runny egg yolk. Life\'s good.
In terms of looks, it\'s an odd, indistinct lump but who cares when that candied orange slice is winking at you and the pastry\'s rich buttery flakiness (within which more bits of candied orange hide) is filling your senses. 
Gleaming with a glass-like smoothness, the lemon curd filling of this tart was equally smooth in the mouth. Instead of the usual meringue complement, the baker cleverly tempered the potent sourness of it with housemade marshmallows instead - they\'re those cute little white cubes scattered across the top. The buttery crust was on the right side of crisp and blended with everything else beautifully.
Do.main Bakery is a casual, home-style French bakery at Tanjong Katong Road that has gained a loyal following from the excellent pastries and viennoiseries it serves. Besides the usual sweets, they do serve savouries like charcuterie (from Bar-roque Grill), quiches, and breakfast dishes. The Tartiflette \"Reblochon\" ($16) – comprising oven baked potatoes, bacon and cheese – is almost faultless. A classic combination and melty, gooey cheese? What\'s not to love? The Salted Caramel Eclair ($5) is easily one of the best we’ve ever had: filled with luscious salted caramel custard in a crisp pastry shell and topped with more salted caramel. Get some croissants, bread, or danishes to go as well. Or, indulge your sweet tooth in their High Tea set if you\'ve got the time ($32 for two).
$32 high tea set is definitely value for money. Not to forget that the set comes with 2 pots of awesome Rose with french vanilla tea from @dilmahceylontea. The Rose tea is so good that even @thechosenglutton likes it 😊😊😊 #Dilmah\n<br />#openricesgxdilmah
Do.main bakery is finally having high tea!!! Yes, $32 for 2 pax and the spread is ggoooooooooddd! Thanks to @dilmahceylontea for organising the \"Host a high tea\" challenge that we can now enjoy yummy bakes with aromatic tea from Dilmah\'s fine selection of tea.
You can enjoy a range of desserts : “Bourdaloue Pear &amp; Almond Tart” ,  Salted Caramel Eclair ,  White Coffee Cake and Royal Chocolate Cake.
duck and pistachio pate complimented well with the artisan breads and the pork rillette married got the brunch together with the pickles. \n<br />a wholesome breakfast to crave for.
Bought the salted caramel eclair and the apple tart home but ended up eating them only the next day oops. The eclair was thankfully still quite puffy and the salted caramel wasn\'t too overpoweringly sweet, and I liked the apple tart, the even slices were still a wee bit crunchy even though it\'s been left for hours. #Burpple
Shortbread crust with lemon curd filling, topped with marshmallows.
first, you take a piece of stick bread. then, you vigorously mix the entire dish together, that\'s how broken eggs comes about. \n<br />on another note, it is reminiscently similar to our soft boiled eggs. \n<br />TGIF folks
Awesome french pastries &amp; dessert right at do.main bakery. Good flavors &amp; good texture! 
The shell was much for sturdier, housing that lush cream within, decorated with star like sugar studs on it.
Which was just launched on Saturday when we visited.
An Orange Danish would be perfect right now… #DoMainBakery
Millefeuille Jivara - Chantilly Jivara Quenelle between 2 thin milk chocolate layers, with Hazelnut dacquoise &amp; Croustillant praliné base.
Paris Brest, Cream Puff, Lemon Tart, Mille Feuille Jivara and Rum and Raisin Financier .
Delicious treats. This is the Millefeuille Jivara. Love the texture of the crispy base. 😋 #RAGEeats #CoffeeAndCravings
The much loved Creme puff and Lemon tart. The Paris Brest, Rum and RaisinFfinancier are worthy a try too. We might need some savoury food again after this stop.
Basket of freshly baked french pastries for you? Review of Do.Main Bakery up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio. Have a restful Saturday!
Love Bar-Roque Grill\'s divine charcuterie? You can now get them at Do.Main Bakery too. The selection changes all the time; today we got a trio of kurobuta ham, pork rillette and duck terrine. Yum, very yum and super yummm! 
Light and refreshing, it was a comforting slice with all the flavours hitting the right notes. The pear slices were lightly sweetened and perfectly complemented by the almond base, if there\'s just one thing your stomach can fit, have this! Check out our latest review on what this bakery has to offer!
a dainty little cafe along tanjong katong serving French pastries and desserts. \n<br />our second pitstop on #takeSSout by @thesilverchef &amp; @paulineanghh
Mum asked if we could go back to have their Quiche Lorraine again and we also got one of these to share. Two eggs served with bacon, cheese and cream alongside toast soldiers. Toast was crusty and crunchy and had a nice nutty flavour to it. Eggs were done runny, with some savoury flavour from the thick cuts if bacon that was chewy; great to dip the toast soldiers into!
Puff pastry with a layer of crushed almonds in a cake-like middle layer. The puff pastry might be a tad stiff to pull apart, but that light nutty fragrance that it gives off is so alluring that you would yearn for more.
Mille feuille jivara. If you know your ingredients, you should know that jivara is one of the milk chocolate from Valrohna. 40%! My favourite chocolate from Valrohna! Hahaha! Very soothing to the throat!
I love the fact that they used a slab of bacon and cut it into chunks to give that bite in the quiche. Two thumbs up!
Wishing everyone a great year with an abundance of joy, health &amp; wealth!! 🍊🍊
Another unexpectedly good creation that I wish could be a main-stayer 🍊excellent smooth filling with a nice citrusy burst! 2 fat ones for $9 🍊🍊
Here are some beautiful and delicious Macarons that would definitely keep u smiling😃 Peanut Butter Caramel that taste like a Reese-Snicker-Mars fusion, Coconut and Caraibe Chocolate// bigger than average but only $2 each! #不要走宝 [Credit model: @littlemissbento ]
Have a romantic, heart-centric Saturday. ❤️ Photo by Burppler Elaine Koh #Burpple
This honestly isn\'t the best buns in the world but I guess any lovebirds wouldn\'t mind as they only have each other in their eyes💏 Happy V\'Day💘
coconut, peanut caramel (imagine snicker bar macarons!) and chocolate macarons.\n<br />The most interesting one is for sure the peanut caramel ones! Highly recommended to try this!👍 (actually you should try all!😁) I think you can officially call me a macaron lover. 😂 Ps: read the full review on my dayre!😊
My favourite has to be the Peanut with Caramel ~ imagine the perfect marriage of the flavours of snicker bar and macarons! 😱❤️ The coconut ganache and dark chocolate macarons are equally good too! \n<br />Not a usual macaron fan but these ones I will gladly eat them!! 😚
Not sugar. These two are not equivalents. You will be amazed by how light and NOT sweet this Vanilla Choquette is. A rare gem amidst the boom of cafes, pastry shops or whatsoever.
Good to know I can get them 5 minutes away from home.Have to try their croissants for breakfast next since they are open from 8 am.
The cream is nice , just not something I\'ll come back for in a hurry @ $5 per pc.
It\'s all about the bass and no treble, as the cake\'s thick, J.Lo-sized hazelnut wafer booty triumphantly bounces away most traces of white coffee, which is probably a size two at best. 3.5/5
We love the rich and luscious cream encased within the crunchy shell. Tarts, quiches and sandwiches are some of the popular selections here.
I am yours. You are mine. The end.\n<br />Oh but in case more details are required, this small square is made of 70% dark chocolate and a gorgeous slightly salty buttery pastry crust. It is beautiful with a cup of coffee. 
Very happy that I listened to Leo, a cheerful and earnest member of the staff at Do.Main, who recommended this to me. Petite in size, it\'s a unique cake that\'s composed of a thick layer of light Mascarpone cheese, fragrant coffee sponge and caramelised chopped hazelnuts. The intriguing mash-up of textures ensured a blissful bite every time.
Through a big glass window towards the back of the sitting area, you can see the big, white kitchen space where the goods are made and baked daily. So one thing\'s for sure, their items should be really fresh. \n<br />The Apricot Danish that\'s part of my breakfast set ($7 with a small but fragrant latte), was not huge but it was nice, being light and fairly flaky.\n<br />I thought the Fruit Tart ($5) tasted decent plus it came with a reasonable price point. Arranged neatly on the top were slightly sour dark plum pieces that was balanced off by the plentiful sweet glaze. What I liked most was the firm, buttery crust.\n<br />Since the selection of items at Do.Main is quite wide and it\'s located close to home, I plan to return soon to try their other items (am already eyeing the sea salt caramel eclair!). Service here is also really good and like everyone else, I like to support places that make me feel welcome :)
Puff was a little dry and cream was a little too thick.
I am not a fan of quiches, but I must say that this is really one of the Quiche Lorraine that I enjoyed eating; even possibly the best I ever had. The light crust had a savoury flavour along, adding flavour to the eggy insides which were spiked with huge chunks of bacon and ham for flavour. There is also a light touch of cheese atop, and it not only felt fresh, it really was very well put together. A must-order here!
There are really countless of good bakeries and patisseries in town but there isn\'t really one much like Do.Main Bakery. Situated at Tanjong Katong, it sits alongside a variety of eateries that serves Nasi Lemak, Ice-Cream and Italian fare. Bakes such as their quiches, tarts, Danishes to even the bread used for their sandwiches are baked in-house daily, ensuring the quality of their food served. While their tarts and puffs would definitely hit all the right spots of the sweet-tooth, the Quiche Lorraine filled with chunky bits of ham and bacon over a light pastry is the one that seals the deal. A spot that would soon be a favourite for the rich taitais in this neighbourhood to hangout for some bakes and tea!
Essentially a tart with poached pears and almonds, the tart was pretty sweet but not in typically caramalised fashion; it seemed to contain a certain type of dreaminess in its sweetness as though there is alcohol involved. The tart base is not too crumbly as it comes off neatly with every cut
Usually puffs are just light, spongey pastries but this one takes a step further by adding almonds and sugar crystals atop, which gives it a toasted yet sweet twist. The cream is of mild sweetness; wee bit eggy as though near a custard but well-flavoured with vanilla. Pretty interesting for something done a million times.
Quintessential #boulangerie at #tanjongkatong. It has all the #hipster #vibes: great #food, nice #coffee and #cheery atmosphere.

Do.Main Bakery :\n<br />The only Salted Egg Croissant ($6) that is different from the others in Singapore. Instead of having a sweet custard filling, @do_main_bakery adds cheese into their salted egg custard. The cheesy, creamy and savoury custard, along with the flaky and fragrant pastry would be best accompanied with a cup of coffee/tea. The best part of eating at Do.Main Bakery is that you also get to feast your eyes on how the pastries are made; the smoothness of the dough that was rolled out by the chef is simply satisfying. \n<br />#ailove2eat #goodfood #loveforfood #instafood #foodporn #fooddiary #foodlover #맛있어요 #おいしい #sgfood #singapore #singaporefood #instaworthy #igfood #igphoto #instaphoto #foodstagram #sgig #instasg #foodie #food #saltedegg #croissant #saltedeggcroissant #domain
So not able to compare. But what i liked about this was the fresh buttery soft and flaky croissant. Salted egg yolk was slightly fluid and abit grainy(as expected in all salted egg yolk). #croissants #saltedeggyolk #pastries #burpple #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #singaporeinsiders #singaporeeats #stfoodtrending #igers #cafesg #sgfoodies #bloggersg
Abit sour which i really adored. #pastries #dessert #dessertlovers #bakers #cafesg #burpple #openricesg #i8mondays @do.mainbakery #8dayseat #sgfoodies #bloggerssg Thank you, Chef Frederick, the owner who was my ex-pastry instructor, for taking time to talk to me.

A tiny tot that packs a 👊. Cream so smooth and not too sweet. Puff was light and crisp with the nuts that gave that added crunchy texture. Yumz😋 #chouxpuff #cream #brunch #sgfoodie #foodblogger #burpple #openricesg #frenchbakery

I wish I could have one now to start the morning
because then it doesn\'t feel like work, does it? Three months of working with Chef Frederic Deshayes of @do_main_bakery , and I am still learning new things everyday. Today, he showed off his trial of sour dough breads in the pastry kitchen - he\'s testing longer fermentation timing and how that affects longevity of the breads etc. He checks on their lifespan by feel and by sniffing the breads. I call this the \'escargot looking bread\'. After last  Sunday\'s piece in The Sunday Times, he said the sour dough was sold out one hour after opening; by 9am. Since his passion is in sharing classic French style breads, this has been the perfect fuel for more bread experiments in the kitchen. #domainbakery #bread #eatsg #mianbao #fredericdeshayes #burpple

I love this pastry since I was a kid! And it\'s not easy to find this! Super super love this!!!!!!
Freshly baked pastries!
Best eaten with the fantastic bread or simply...on its own 😊
Sharing the love... 💕
😀✨👩Trying their Apple tart here.
☺️ ps: THE BREADS WERE SO GOOD! 👍 Another worthy cafe to check out for the Eastsiders.☺️
The crunchy base, the chocolate, super good lah! 😁
Smell so good, taste so good! 😍😋
My new found favourite
Only flaw- the apple sauce was a little sour.
