L\'etoile is a lifestyle store cum cafe with Japanese-French influences. Perfect for a quiet day spent with a great cup of coffee and a good book, this hidden gem in the Farrer Park area stands out from the crowd with their eclectic furniture choices. As evening sets in, sit back with a glass of wine and watch the world go by.
Not very crowded cafe in the northeast. Located around Farrer Park. \n<br />Coffee is fragrant and strong. Latte art was brilliant and special as requested.
The bagel was way too tough. But the long black was good. For those who like the coffee not too sour, you will love it.
Bagel + Egg Benedict + Truffle Fries + Big Breakfast + Caesar Salad + Latte + Mocha + Long Black =  all these for only 3 people. OMG! Sadly to say the eggs weren\'t very fresh and the salad was way too little. The plating was so so. However, the ambient was great!
Soggy crepe. End of story. üò£
Cafe tucked in the corner of the street. Chicken and shitake mushrooms, totally noms.
Nice coffee and a lil 1950\'s ambience type of cafe. Good for catch up sessions with friends. 
$17.90 for a dish that could have been better. The broccoli was over cooked and sausage was tough. Mash potatoes were fab. 
Love the tranquility and quirkiness of this cafe - cosy and relaxed. The lace curtains add a touch of romance, especially lovely against the setting sun. A shame the food was forgettable - truffle fries were bleh and way too greasy.
Love the tranquility and quirkiness of this cafe. A little casual, with random trinkets placed all around, cosy and relaxed. A shame the food wasn\'t impressive - truffle fries were bleh and way too greasy.

$12.00 Truffle fries is oily and doesn\'t leave any impression, except that the serving is just too much. Good for sharing with more people.
L\'etoile Big breakfast - One of the worst breakfast ever eaten. Toast is soggy and oily, scrambled egg is tasteless, mushrooms and potato cubes are too salty. #failbigtime
This is actually turning out to be one of my least favorite breakfast. Slightly overpriced and not valued for money. Much can be improved with more generous sauces and a stronger taste.
Least expected it to be plated together with a scoop of Oreo chocolate ice cream. Great texture with drizzles of melted butter on top. 
Mum made Korean pancakes with seafood üòÑ just what I need to conquer the geog paper in one and a half hour\'s time!
Super yumz fat-free yogurt with only 50 calories per tub to make up for the sinful amount of chocolate I had just now üòÑ
What better way to start your day with this colourful breakfast?
Easily my favorite chillout place these days. Second time in as many weeks. 
Hidden away from the bustling district, L\'etoile cafe is a nice chill out place for brunch/dinner. My bf n I tried their big breakfast n egg Benedict! the big breakfast was so-so but the poached egg was nicely done for the egg Benedict ! 
The coffee is way too hot. They burnt the milk &gt;_
Strawberry Shortcake... Canele\'s Strawberry Shortcake is still nicer #burpple
Big breakfast (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë) #burpple
With a pool of salted caramel and a soft center. Yummy! 
good Monday morning! how about a great breakfast to start off your day :) from L\'etoile Cafe, a cafe u should never miss out on!
One of my favourite place to hide from the rest of the world.
Counting down... the last 9th day. Celebrate with a Warm Chocolate topped with Vanilla Icecream!
I like the tasty beef patty. comfort meal indeed. #foodporn #instasg #igsg
Bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon. #Breakfast #bagel pretty damn nommy.

I like that this cafe doesn\'t try too hard to impress you with the pretentious decor, just clean and simple furniture and decor. What I\'m blown away is this Azuki Matcha Green Tea Chiffon cake - so light and perfectly complemented by the Azuki red beans. I would believe it if they say this is a Japanese recipe. So Japanese, so good. Left me wanting more. #japaninsingapore #greentea #azuki #chiffon #cake #cafe #cafehopping #workfromcafe
