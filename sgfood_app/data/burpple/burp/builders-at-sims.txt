Spicy crab penne and crispy wings were the winner for tonight, oh did we mentioned how smooth the hot chocolate was? \n<br />Will be back for their coffee soon! \n<br />#tamjiakteo #tamjiakcouple #burpple
Was in a situation that didn\'t allow me to get a good capture but their Ratatouille Pasta ($10.90) (p.s. the one at the back) was truly one of the best vegetarian pasta I\'ve tried this year - Tagliatelle, eggplant, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, squash, zucchini &amp; kombu butter 💕 As a meat lover myself, I\'d honestly say I won\'t mind having it everyday - it was that addictive. All of which has also inspired me to attempt it at home but results were definitely nowhere near, their sauce was phenomena.\n<br />&amp; Of course, you can\'t go wrong with carbonara pasta &amp; truffle fries, something we consider basic these days. If only I wasn\'t sick that day I\'d have also went ahead &amp; order their signature coffee in a cone, maybe next time?\n<br />Regardless, this hidden gem makes a perfect quiet retreat just 8 mins walk away from Aljunied MRT. Sigh, is it normal to be missing work so bad 😭
.\n<br />|\n<br />I love the idea of honey with crispy wing. The strong contrast between savour and sweet was delightful to eat. However, it tasted very similar with Mac wings.
Good atmosphere, affordable and sumptuous. Must tries: Beef ( 24hr sous-vide beef cheek), salmon, Wagyu burger! Service is very good too. Will come back for their coffee and desserts! 
Ordered the beef cheek, crab pasta, fish, golden wings, truffle fries and sweet potato fries and none of them disappointed! Food was affordable and the service was impeccable! The staff there were really nice and they even gave us a complimentary ice-cream cone latte when they realised we were celebrating our friend\'s birthday (:
Bitter &amp; sweet that marries coffee &amp; melt chocolate so well. Verdict 5/5.
Nestled in a quiet Geylang neighborhood, Builders at Sims is an unpretentious cafe that serves good coffee and food at value-for-money prices. Bonus points for the enthusiastic staff too! Bring your family for a cozy meal or to get some work done during the day (there’s free Wifi). The simply named Beef ($14.90) is one of their most popular items – 24 hour sous-vide beef cheeks atop a bed of mashed potatoes and various vegetables. For something creamy and comforting, the Carbonara ($10.90) was delightfully smooth without being too cloying. \n<br />Avg price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Lee Jia Hui
I tried the beef menu on the main pervious &amp; yesterday tried the chicken 😁 The chicken is tender &amp; delicious to be shared with ur love ones 🙆🏻
Is super crispy n I feel that is a MUST to order as ur sides with family or friends 😋
Norwegian Salmon with White Miso &amp; Buttered Rice ($14.90 nett)
Dang this Mushroom Soup with Truffle Oil ($5.90 nett) is legit 🍄 Very affordable, isn\'t over-blended, &amp; has great flavour. 👍
Tempted by @burpple\'s snapchat last night at the new kid in the Aljunied neighbourhood. Bad lighting and bad phone camera are doing this pasta injustice. I was surprised by the pasta well done, exceeding my expectation. It was a really generous portion of crab meat (all hidden underneath those penne) and the crab bisque was thick and strong enough to my liking. The place is also very cosy with free wifi (another reason to stay here longer 🙈). This is a promising one I would say!
Last night\'s dinner situation at Builders at Sims! Look at the hulking piece of patty! 💪💪💪 Although our first patty was a little too eager to meet us and came off the grill a bit raw, the very friendly staff gladly exchanged it for another one which came out just right. The burger was tasty, with a curiously springy quality that would remind you of a good sausage. (And those curly fries 😛) We were pretty happy with our meal at this young cafe! Looking forward to trying their beef and crab dishes next time since they were sold out when we visited yesterday 😩
We were a little worried to cut into that incredibly thick patty and true enough it was raw in the middle. After informing the staff, she apologised vehemently and  brought it back to the kitchen immediately. We were served a new one after a couple minutes, and while the patty probably needed to rest first (it bled as the knife pierced it), the doneness was spot on. Hooray for service recovery! 
The cheesetastic and pilates-firm pasta stewed together with the chunky vegetables in the earthy broth, the pair blissfully in the indulgently languorous state of lovey vacationers in a Pan Pacific Hotel suite bathtub. 3.7/5
The dish is served with an egg confit resting on the pasta so make sure to burst it and mix it!

The carbonara is rather unique, it isn\'t creamy like most carbonaras available elsewhere. I really enjoyed this because it was rich in flavour but not to the extent I got sick of it (which happens for many carbonaras)
Perfect dose of flat white!!
\"Forget the exact menu name\"... sundae... \n<br />Is a good portion to share among ur love ones! N is not too sweet, everything is just nice n right. Don\'t miss ur meal with a last bite of dessert 😋

Interesting how the mocha (S$5.00) here adopts the leopard prints, without compromising its attitude.
Some may find it spicy while other may find it salty. I think it\'s just right 😜\n<br />🦀
Tasting the chocolate on the come at the end of each dip. 有点先苦后甜的感觉.\n<br />#latte #latteart #buildersatsims #coffee #singapore #burpple

Crispy on the outside, sweet in the inside....... delicious!!!!
But maybe it was because I had a really late lunch. Lol.
Goes great with the latte!
Simply named as Beef ($14.90), pretty good portion and quite a homely meal of 24hr sous vide beef cheeks - tender enough though not quite melt-in-the-mouth tender; with comforting creamy mashed, pumpkin chips and veggies. \n<br />Overall pretty decent and a nice place to chill with a good cuppa.
.\n<br />|\n<br />One of the best carbonara I had so far. The bacon for seasoning and onsen egg for creaminess. I loved the touch of Rosemary which countered the usual heaviness found in most carbonara.
In actual fact, there were total 5 drumlets. Deep fried crispy and slightly salty. Drizzled with homemade curry vinaigrette. None of that oily taste so one can savour the sweet n salty flesh. Alittle spicy, quite addictive &amp; finger licking good. \n<br />Ever wondered why cucumbers are used as garnish? Because it contains water, flushes heat inside and out &amp; detoxifies. So when you consume fried or bbq, remember eat your cucumbers.
Awesome taste, value-for-money &amp; impeccable customer service 👍🏻
Classy food in a quiet neighborhood. #delishfoodlovers #foodporn #sgfood #burpple #ilovesharingfood #sgfoodporn #vscocamsg #vscocam #whatiate #mychefstable

Carbonara rating 4/ 5.
The chicken wings was super nice. Crispy on the outside and juicy and soft on the inside. The sauce was just the right amount not taking away the crunch to the skin but adding flavor to it. The truffle fries I would say is one of the best I\'ve had in any cafe for a long time. I love my fries crispy and these truffle fries was just right. I like that they weren\'t stingy on the truffle oil and the truffle mayo really added a little something to the already delicious fries. Plus the boss was very friendly and understanding. We went in a little late but she still allowed us to decide what we wanted giving us extra time even though it was already their last order and even though they were closing up, she still kept helping us to top up our water and checking on us that we had everything that we needed and that the food was to our liking. Very pleasent experience. I\'ll definitely be back 😻
Thank you @nikewaterbottle for pouring a great cuppa and @gohmeining @buildersatsims for the complimentary cuppa. So sweet of u guys😄\n<br />#coffeexample #coffeetime #coffeegram #coffeenart #thingsaboutcoffee #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #stfoodtrending #baristasg #baristas #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafollow #igsg #igers #tripadvisor #townske_official #buildersatsims #cafesg
24h sous vide beef cheeks. Extremely tender. Literally melts in your mouth. Seasoning was just so spot on. One of the creamiest and smooth mash with sweetilicious maize for the slight crunch. The pumpkin chips are super delish. I rarely sing high praises for \"very young\"openings. But I truly enjoyed my dish and also there was the wonderful company which was unexpected😄\n<br />Nearest mrt : Aljunied\n<br />Exit B. Cross overhead bridge, walk straight and turn right, you will see blk 52. Builders is next block. Open at 11am to 9pm.\n<br />#lunch #i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igers #igsg #instameetsg #instafollow #singaporeeats #tripadvisor
