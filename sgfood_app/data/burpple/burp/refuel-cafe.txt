For good brunch at affordable prices in the heartland! Their Earl Grey Lavender ($7.90) was divine, really good earl grey flavor and touch of lavender in its chiffon layers. Not too rich or sweet, great for after brunch coffee.
Wipe out the whole plate myself. Dont mind going there again to try more.
If you are craving for eggs, waffle and good coffee all in one place, you should visit this cafe! No gst, no service charge.
Glad you enjoyed the treat ‚ù§üòÖ\n<br />_\n<br />The food here was really on point and price point was on the lower side. One of the best pancakes with actual banana bits embedded in the pancakes. Will definitely return!
Baked Eggs served with toast, in a warm comforting tomato base and minced meat ; French Toast - thick toasts (tho ok a little too thick for my liking and could afford to be slightly fluffier) that can\'t go too wrong because NUTELLA. And peanut butter. Quite a heavy dessert, definitely gotta share it! #burpple
I can\'t resist myself to order early grey cake ,Bc I like the smell and the taste of earl grey ,but in fact this earl grey lavender cake didn\'t win my heart ,we can\'t  finish this slide of cake .
Neighborhood cafe near Bedok reservoir !we order Extra tank  ($16.50),and ultimate French toast ($12.90),portion are big but taste so so only .
Need to cool down with an #affogato with double scoops of vanilla ice-cream.
We really loved their scrambled eggs and mashed potatoes. The scrambled eggs are top quality with a superb texture and fragrant taste. The chef has definitely got the milk and butter proportions down just right here. üòª\n<br />Full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/11/refuel-cafe-the-hidden-gem-bedok-reservoir/
Still can\'t get over the fact that my bestfr wasn\'t lying when he said this amazing cafe is just across where he lives. Love the lively and bustling cafe with it\'s rustic settings. We ordered this pancake banana ($9.50); perfect combination of chocolate and banana. I mean what could possibly go wrong with this made in heaven combo? Fluffy and soft pancakes, sweet bananas and rich chocolate ice cream and sauce with the finishing of the nutty flavours of pistachios. Love it very much! We had this together with our mains and I found myself choosing this over the latter. Definitely going back to try their other desserts and mains. Great find at bedok! You\'re totally missing out if you haven\'t been there and live near there like my bestfr do! üòâ
üòç\n<br />The salmon here is always cooked to the correct tenderness, and the secret spicy creamy sauce is the super delicious highlight of the dish. That appetizing sauce has a tangy sour-savoury taste and is seriously addictive. It goes perfectly well with the salmon and the included mashed potatoes.\n<br />Full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/11/refuel-cafe-the-hidden-gem-bedok-reservoir/
You will never get this quality of ribs at this price anywhere else in Singapore. The ribs are very tender and the honey glazing is absolutely delicious.\n<br />See full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/11/refuel-cafe-the-hidden-gem-bedok-reservoir/
happy valentines! üíì hope you spent your day with your loved ones! for dinner today, we decided to drop by here. i had the Pulled Pork Burger ($12.90). the bun was a little plain, but the pulled pork was drenched with sauce which made it less dry, and more yummy. üòç it\'s hard to find cafes with a wide selection of food, but Refuel has done it, not forgetting the fact that it\'s rather price friendly! lots of glass to allow light to enter, but when it\'s dark outside, the lighting inside should be improved! \n<br />in this picture also includes the Salted Caramel Waffle ($9.90) and the Bacon Aglio ($11.90).
I really had a wonderful time catching up with my ex-student who treated me to this yummy meal.  I am heartened to know that she is doing well in life and I\'m so proud of her! üíïüíïüíï Thanks @bunnified_f (Date: 11 December 2015 Friday)
$13.50 | the portion of smoked salmon is far too little the salad side was tasty, the scrambled eggs were a little salty on one side. Overall, this dish was worth it üôåüèªüëçüèª
Quite an enjoyable, affordable brunch. Fuel Me Up ($13.90) - with everything a breakfast should have, portion was pretty huge. Bacon was too salty though. Bacon olio ($11.90) was quite nice according to my friend (but she\'s too selfish to share HAHAHA). Pretty lovely space to chill.
A sexy looking brunch right by a breezy lake (what Singapore calls reservoirs). A cozy space along the kopitiams and marketplace of bedok reservoir. Great to unwind if you\'re looking for a chill place amidst the heartlands!
Different from what u would expect from pulled pork (i.e. Shredded pork drenched in bbq sauce), their version of pulled pork was marinated like charsiew sauce or hoisin sauce(?). Different in a good way. Reasonably priced with no GST/Service charge. Will definitely come back.
Tucked in the corner of residential flats, refuel cafe is a chill petrol station inspired cafe. Their food definitely re-fuel and kickstart our day on a good note! I had the Refuel pancakes with smoked salmon which was pretty affordable in my opinion as their servings were generous. Three fluffy pancakes with light and delicious scrambled eggs, 3 slices of pretty large smoked salmon pieces and some garden salad. One of the few cafes with quick service, no extra GST and service charges.
Had a meetup with my friends and since we all stay in the east, we decided to try Refuel cafe. The drinks were not bad but the pancakes I ordered were super small and thin and was soaked in idk was it water or oil. Overall it tasted average but doubt I\'ll come by here again :(
Added bacon to the banana pancake. The pancake costs $9.90, and bacon $2.50... That\'s why... Not recommended to add additional sides... Pretty good value for money for the pancake itself!
13.90, no gst or service charge. Generous servings. My favorite components would be the garlic mushroom and crispy bacon (which I don\'t even usually enjoy!). Texture of scrambled egg was good but it lacked flavour. Come here to fill your belly with yummies without burning a hole in your pocket. 
9.90, no gst or service charge. Pancakes are reminiscent of Mac\'s (not necessarily a bad thing). Scrambled eggs had a good texture but lacked seasoning. The sausage I liked as it wasn\'t too salty. 
As defined by it\'s name, this version of thick, creamy mushroom soup is another top hit of the cafe (we\'re guessing). It tasted freshly cooked, and beats Campbell\'s hands down anytime! 
An unconventional Mac &amp; Cheese, this dish is divinely baked to perfection! Crispy on the sides and top, the inside was moist with the pasta and it\'s companions. Don\'t miss trying this. On my recommended list. 
Located at a small corner in the neighbourhood of bedok amidst shophouses and marts, (near the bedok reservoir, quite far away from mrt stations but still accessible via bus) this small friendly looking cafe is already bustling with customers on a sunday within the first hour of its operation. I had to be put on a waiting list for a while.. but it is definitely worth it with its affordable tasty food and quick service despite the crowd. Items featured in the photo includes all the recommended brunch dishes: Full Tank $13.90/Refuel Pancakes w smoked salmon $11.90/Meat Sauce Crossiant $8.50. The cafe doesn\'t charge Gst and service charge, and total bill only sums up to about $39 (including latte). Verdict: Really love the food here! highly recommended especially if you\'re an eastie, but it\'s still worth the travel (but do come early on weekends!) 4.0/5.0.
I did not even touch the toast but its already more than awesome! #burpple
the toast was good, scrambled egg is runny which I like, side salad dressing is perfect, really crispy bacon...I loved my full tank brunch...ofcourse must try their raspberry sparkling juice with mint n lime...really refreshing!
A hidden gem tucked in the quieter part of Bedok Reservior, Refuel Cafe definitely hits the spot with the Full Tank ($13.90), which comes with scrambled eggs, bratwurst sausage, salad, mushroom and toast (I changed the tomatoes and baked beans for more scrambled eggs). Their scrambled eggs were done masterfully with the right mix of milk and buttery goodness. Special mention for their pancakes too, as it was well executed.
They served all day brunch, nice place for a quite lunch. This full tank ($12) really does fill u up!! 
Soft pancakes that are well accompanied by the salted caramel and ice cream. Salted caramel was a blend of sweet and salty 
Good to have a nice cafe in neighbourhood area. Food wise not bad. Mushrooms are nice. Great for those who live nearby and lazy travel to brunch areas.
Pancakes, didn\'t choose the banana ones, cause i wanted plain pancakes with sweet maple syrup tonight. Sides of light flavour scrambled eggs, sourish salad and salty sausage.
üôè pray to be able to sleep tonight for 830am class tomorrow
Light and fluffy pancakes w rolled smoked salmon. Need I say more? ‚ô°
Shredded pork soaked in Sweet BBQ sauce with sliced pickles! Not too filling too!
Yums. 
Travelled all the way to the east to give this newly open cafe. Their cafe are designed cater to the petrol station theme. Menu ranging from Full Tank, Fuel ME up to REFUEL pancake. We had the recommended stack of pancake serve with scrambled eggs with Bratwurst Sausage at $9.90 nett. On a side note, what are the must try cafe in the east? Please let me know! üòÇ
New cafe at bedok serving affordable and surprisingly yummy grub. Definitely worth a try!
Just opened in the Bedok Reservoir neighbourhood is a new petrol station-themed cafe serving great and very affordable brunch. Staying true to their name and theme, menu items have theme-specific names such as \'Full Tank\', \'Fill Me Up\' and \'Refuel Pancakes\'. Their chill cafe space also allows diners a true refueling experience away from the busy city. Start with the Full Tank ($13.90) or Banana Pancakes ($8.90), and get the White &amp; Black Chocolate Tart with vanilla/ chocolate ice cream for dessert! According to Tastemaker Xing Wei, \'This was literally a slice from chocolate heaven.\'
New cafe less than one month old .. Located at Bedok reservoir road
Found this place through Burpple (thanks Xing Wei!). Just a few days old, this cafe hidden in a HDB estate is great for a lazy Sunday afternoon. I got the iced lime tea which is pretty unique and refreshing! It\'s also just a stone\'s throw from Bedok Reservoir, if you\'re looking to get away from urban Singapore for awhile.
We have seen many caf√©s adopting several themes; from motorbike themes, to simplistic themes, but this is probably the first time I had chanced on a petrol station themed one. From the Shell signage within the cafe, to funky names such as \"V-Power soda\" in the menu, the theming runs deep. Most items are pretty affordable; brunch menu runs from $8.90 to $13.90, and there are also mains, pasta and sandwiches available. With reasonable quality, portion size and prices, this spot would be somewhere Bedok residents will never mind visiting.
but too late üò´‚Ä¢ Just had our brunch [REFUEL PANCAKES S$9.90] - a stack of pancakes with bratwurst sausage (or bacon) &amp; scrambled eggs.
This was literally a slice from chocolate heaven. Thick, thick chocolate ganache sitting atop a white chocolate ganache and a chocolate base that is adequately sweet without burning the throat. So sinful it actually hurts. Comes with a choice of chocolate or vanilla ice-cream.
They use Brazilian beans from a local roaster for their coffee here. Mild body with a earthy finish.
Banana Pancakes come with garden salad and scrambled eggs. Those irregular pancakes may not be the best way to present delectable pancakes, but the batter used is filled with mushy bananas which was pretty fragrant. Scrambled eggs were creamy and runny, while the garden salad seemed a tad butter. Simple, yet comforting brunch fare indeed!
Literally the full works here. Comes with toast, scrambled eggs, saut√©ed mushrooms, bacons, roasted potatoes and salad. Great homely fare, especially the soft roasted potatoes, and the runny scrambled eggs and the bacon which was crisp. Most of the items seemed to be lightly seasoned; probably a good thing for the health-conscious.
Thanks for the company and the treat üòô #refuelcafesg #refuelcafe #bedokcafes #cafehoppingsg #eatoutsg #sgcafes #sgcafe #sgig #igsg #instasg #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #8dayseat #whati8today #burpple #burppleSG #openricesg #hungrygowhere #swweats #thegrowingbelly #epochtimesfood #fatclayfood #iweeklyfood #foodphotography #foodstagram #STFoodTrending
cream tomyum sauce
Ordered the pancakes w sausage and I\'m very satisfied with the portion price and taste!! The pancakes were fluffy and thin enough without tasting too starchy (or gelat). Did a weird thing by dipping the sausage into the pancake syrup and can I just say it goes surprisingly well tgt!! The piccolo latte was not bad, with strong fruity notes from the expresso that sort of complemented the chocolatey flavour that came with milk! #refuelcafe #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #exploresingapore #onthetable #whati8today #burpple #affordablebrunches

I\'m usually not a cream pasta person, the tangy Flavours of tom yam cut through the heaviness of the cream but I felt it could be spicier and richer in flavour.. seafood is fresh and value for money #gettingfatwhilewaiting #burrple #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljnck #lomljns
everything you want with ur breakfast, to fill ur tank FULL (geddit üòú)? The testament to a good brunch set like this is in the eggs and bacon..they serve a mean scrambled eggs.. normally not a fan but these were gooooood! The bacon was fried to a crisp that it tasted like crispy bah Kwa! Super value for money! Dylan was a satisfied customer üòãüç¥ #burpple #foodiesunite #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljnck #lomljns
LOVE IT! this murky home-made concoction is full of citrusy Flavours of orange, lime and lemon Flavours and just a hint a sweetness.. shiok after a round around the Bedok reservoir.. must drink! #burpple #foodjunkies #foodiesunite #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljns #lomljnck
I loved the corn on cob, sweet and juicy.. the coleslaw is not usually heavy laden with mayo type so my sis liked it and ate most of it. Overall worth the money! #burpple #foodiesunite #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljnck #lomljns
Smooth aromatic fresh brewed. Regular size please.
üëçüèª3.5/5\n<br />‚úîÔ∏èyes i will revisit, when the place is more accessible\n<br />üìçNearest MRT: Bedok Reservoir (open in end of FY17)
Chicken pesto sandwich, bacon aglio olio and orange mint tea. üòã
This is a unique taste combination that is a seriously one-of-a-kind must try.
Excellent brunch place, reasonable prices, quality food and located in the East ... Perfect!                   Pro tip: make a reservation as they only have around 10 tables

Tart is on the bitter side rather than sweet which goes well with the vanilla ice cream.
