Juicy char siew that is so well barbecued man. Thick and juicy well charred meat. The sio bah is also well cooked. Oh my god.
The char siew is one of the best I have ever tasted in my life. The fat Melts in your mouth and the sauce is so flavourful! 
Char has a new home in the up and coming Jalan Besar estate. The Siew yoke was easily the star of the show, with its wonderfully crisp top, although some may complain about the large portion of fat. Skip the roast duck. 
It is much more spacious than before. Love the hipster vibe here; dimmed lighting, high ceiling with industrial bulbs. And their char siew ($6 per 100gr) is as good as always. But my favorite remains the Butter Chicken ($14). I didn\'t manage to capture all of the dishes as they served it one by one üò¢.
A belated Happy Mother\'s Day to Â¶àÂí™! \n<br />Brought her to ChÂèâr followed by dessert at #BabetteSG \n<br />At the end of dinner she told me, \"tell the people at Char to cook for you less salty next time\"
Char Siew were fatty and tender. Roast pork was alright. #howtonotbefat #char #burrple
I placed the order in advance, asking specifically for the fatty cuts of Char Siew and Shio Bah. Both meat turned out to be leaner than I expect which is a little üòû. I prefer the one I had at their previous location. But, got to give it to them. The skin of the roasted pork belly was still delightfully crispy after 2 hours, without turning hard. For those who love thyme in your food, you will love this Shio Bah very much. #FatFatMeatSeries #Char #PorkBelly #Chinese #Pork #Keto #Burpple\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Photo taken with Fujifilm X100T.\n<br />#fujifilmx_series #fujifilm_xseries #fujifilmsg #X100T #EileenX100T
Thought that these were pretty decent. Crisp and juicy, and they evident shrimp paste flavour that makes it a pretty umami treat.
This would be how an order of 600grams of Roasted Pork would be like at Char. Meat was a little on the leaner side during our visit today; definitely prefer a fattier cut. Despite so, it is hard not to like the biscuit-y crisp skin here which makes their roasted pork a notch better than most.
The signature item at Char that is a must-order. Combining old-school techniques with modern cooking methods, Char\'s charsiew is done sous vide with a sticky honey sauce that coats the meat. The meat today is again a little on the leaner side, but if you don\'t mind it being that way, it\'s pretty much still as memorable as the one I had a while ago.
Quite decent for how the dish was slight sweet and savoury at the same time (more like Char Kway Teow), with chunks of beef within though lacks the wokhei that makes it truly stellar.
Chunky pieces of pork that is lathered with a pretty appetizing salted egg sauce which hits the mark; definitely carried the intended savoury flavours without being too mild nor sickening. The bed of lettuce at the bottom was particularly intriguing for me, giving a little sweetness along that familiar salted egg goodness.
BUT tasted totally not great. Maybe they fried all the hor fun orders in one big wok and resulted with this \"wok-hei-less\" hor fun.
The eggplant soaked up the minced pork sauce and made it so comforting to eat!!!
Nicely done pork skin and tender meat. The belly was well seasoned with salt and five spices which made it so addictive. \n<br />My recommendation: skip the char siew and go for the pork belly
After hearing all the raving reviews, I brought my family to Char. Sadly we were not impressed. (Maybe I set my expectation too high.) They sous vide (slow cooked) the char siew, then grazed with a thick layer of char siew sauce. The texture was great (melt in the mouth) but it lacked of the traditional char-ness. The taste which could only obtain from the traditional charcoal oven. \n<br />To make thing worse, their roasted duck was dry and hard.
Really juicy and succulent pork belly char siu. The gravy has a nice sweet and salty balance, although it is a tad oily probably because of the pork belly cut. We also ordered the Buddha jumping over the wall and the fried bean curd dish which was quite underwhelming. Inside restaurant was noisy due to minimal warehouse decor. Total cost was 20 per person. Next time will just take away char siu instead!
.\n<br />Sio Bak so crispy, with crackling skin that has an addictive crunch.\n<br />.\n<br />Char Siew so fat, which melts in your mouth with its sweet and savoury dressing.\n<br />.\n<br />How nice of them to have shifted nearer to my place and being more accessible. üôå
Went on a Sunday, birthday treat by a group of friends. Char Siew is blackish in colour and not red as we normally know. Very very fatty, which is why the meat is so soft and tender. I would say 40-50% per slice is fats. Oh my. But very tasty char Siew, taste very Hong Kong style. Soy chicken got some sour taste like lime. Very funny taste, maybe I\'m not used to it. Salted egg York pork ribs is good. But the rest is well, as they call themselves. Zi char standard. Nothing to shout about. And it\'s very high class and expensive Zi char. Haha. 
We had a plate at 300g for $18, it was tender and nicely charred but a tad too sweet for me. Roasted pork on the other hand was sold out so I\'ll be backz ü§ì
Using the Hawkerpedia vouchers I got from @Burpple, I decided to treat my parents to some melt-in-your-mouth char siew that I have heard much about. Best with a bowl of steaming white rice, Char\'s signature roasts can get a little jelak but it was super shiok with the nice, moist and fatty bits. Having a plate of Double Roast, we had 200g of both their Special Char Siew and Siew Yuk (crispy pork belly). The Pork Belly had a nice crackling, but the star of the show had to be the Special Char Siew as the tender yet firm meat drenched in the thick gooey glaze was really amazing. And though the meat is definitely more on the fatty side, don‚Äôt think about the calories because just as you can see the well-grilled chunky pieces is truly glistening and made better with its caramelised sweet sauce coating.
The stellar dishes at Char that got my mummy nodding her head in approval. The platter of 3 ($32) with Char\'s mad famous char siew, crackling pork belly and decent roasted duck. The family loves the tenderness of the char siew, with almost same parts of fats and meat, making it almost too guilty to have and too guilty to not have. I particularly liked the cracking pork belly which comes with a golden crispy skin. A less known but stellar dish would be the beef hor fun ($12). Every mouthful was filled with wok hei, what\'s not to like really? Thanks Raine for reminding me about the Hawkerpedia vouchers, I managed to bring my parents out for a good meal for a nominal fee. 
The glistening, the marinate, and the melt in your mouth fatty char Siew. Wanna have this again. By the way, Char moved to Jalan Besar, no new geotag yet. \n<br />Warning: close ups of fatty char Siew may cause hunger or unease.
Char has relocated from Guillemard Road to Jalan Besar, making it much more accessible to get your fatty char siew fix. Occupying the first and second level of the Singapore Lee Clan General Association, this industrial chic restaurant dishes out quality Hong Kong style roasts in air-conditioned surroundings. You must get the Special Char Siew ($7/100g, minimum order of 300g) ‚Äî melt-in-your-mouth chunks of meat, slathered with a dark, umami-rich sauce. Budget 100g of char siew per person and pair that with the Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice ($11) ‚Äî it\'s a winning combination! Other tasty orders include the crackling Roast Crispy Pork Belly ($7/100g, minimum order of 300g) and the wok hei ladened Beef Hor Fun ($12). Pro tip: pre-order your roasts while making a reservation to ensure you get your share before they sell out! If you fancy, bring a bottle of wine to share (corkage is only $25).\n<br />Avg price: $16 per person
It\'s not easy to find char siew like this. Slathered in a sticky black sauce that is just the right balance between sweet and savory, with tender juicy meat. This was SO GOOD. Equally awesome was the crackly roast pork that was deliciously flavourful. My favourite way to eat it is alternating slices of char siew and roast pork so that I get sweet and savory with every other mouthful. How do you like to eat yours? üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
Personally love fatty char siew and Char serves it well! Love how the thick sauces combines with the meat and fats. Not for the faint hearted! 
Not the most intuitive item to order here, but so glad someone wanted to try it cos their riff on this hawker favourite is pretty damn well done! 
A life-changing, life-affirming experience, and deserving to be the locus classicus for glazed char siew. The stupendously fatty char siew has but a mere sliver of chewable flesh in each block, every other inch being unadulterated, molten sweet fat which melts on your tongue with an irresistible sultriness and the celerity of an ice cube under the blazing sun on a Lim Tua Tow Road pavement. 4.5/5
here for the amazeballs molten black gold again. asked if sauce was too heavy-handed today when i saw bro took the char siew and cut into two servings on his plate. to which he flatly reply me with a stare, \"because you never order enough\". hahaahaha.
Soft tender meat encased between melt-in-your-mouth fat that breaks away with every bite.
Can\'t seem to find the wow factor in the Char Siew this time round though. Is it just me or has the standards dropped at Char?
Second visit at Char with my @burpple #Hawkerpedia voucher üéâ Thick yet tender char siew doused with sweet savoury sauce won my heart over and over. My only gripe was that the sauce left a \"siap siap\" feeling in my mouth. The Roasted Duck was less than satisfactory, with many many bones that hinder the whole enjoyment process.
Finally, this restaurant was off my list just before the Christmas break. Both of us agree that the charsiew triumph over the siobak because of that glistening sinful sauce that leans more towards the sweet side. Definitely fantastic but well, we\'ll still stick to Fei Fei\'s charsiew at Yu Hua market since we are the West-ies.
Glistening right back at you, this char siew is a close and divine to how Mother prepare hers, except these babies are too sweet for my liking. More sugar was added to the Charsiew seasoning, thus that gooey caramelised coating. I think they are great, but just not to my personally preference. Charsiew is a tad dry too. A miss for me and my family, but it seemed that everyone else at the restaurant were wowed by it  
My Favourite from Char. Those crispy skin are to die for, you can literally hear the crunch. And all fats just oozes out, and compliments the meat, making the dish crunchy, juicy and tender. It is like having a fiery synchronised dancing of Paquita. 
This. I. Love. Seriously not oily at all, with the aroma of the butter but the crunch of cereal. Great with plain rice, but even more awesome on its own. The only complain I have for this dish, is the lack of chicken itself. I felt that this plate is more of the batter, less of the chicken prices. Nonetheless, this golden dish is seriously delicious that my mom want to recreate it at home! 
Stiry-fried just so perfectly as how four season beans should be. The minced meat is well seasoned, but personally a tad salty for me. But that\'s okay when you have them with a plain bowl of white rice. This plate looked so plain, but packed all the spicy punch which I love. Stir-fried with both fresh cut Chili padi and dried Chili, the dish came out aromatic and beautiful. And I suspected that they throw in some \"È∫ªËæ£\" seeds for extra kick in the butt when you accidentally bite on them. Shiok üëçüèª
This dish came in a sticky dark broth filled with mushrooms and dried scallops along with the well stir fried dou miao. The dou miao(pea sprouts) were crunchy and delicious and enjoyable to eat. The broth was not too sweet or salty, I savored every bit of it and enjoyed the generous amount of dried scallops that was given. Certainly bringing my family back here for another meal again!  
Ordered the roasted duck, roasted pork and char siew. The char siew had so much fatty meat that it felt so sinful with its amazing homemade sauce that tasted similar to the likes of a honey vinegar sauce. Roasted duck was really decent but what really stood out was its roasted pork. The roasted pork skin had such a nice crispy taste to it such that when dipped with the chilli sauce given, it gave me such a great kick! I was also deeply surprised by its wasabi flavored sauce!
The amount of fat in between the char siew was DIVINE! The sauce that came together with the char siew was sweet and goes extremely well with the char siew as well; if you need a good char siew restaurant, this place is highly recommended! Definitely worth coming. üòá\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
.\n<br /> Char serves Cantonese style food with roast pork as their specialty. However, I like their Butter Chicken ($14++) more. The chicken was fragrant; coated in evaporated milk, curry leaves and chili. The prawns were fresh and tasty as well ($6/100 gr). üêìüç§üê∑üëçüèº
Char Siew - the Woodwinds: the caramelised marinate almost dominates the melody to the sweetness of flutes playing, and the thick slices of fatty meat as sexy as the saxophonist jamming out Careless Whisper, yet it\'s tender nature brought out by the clarinet\'s mellow tones.\n<br />Roast Pork - the Brass: the loud crunch of the crackling is comparable to a victorious trumpet fanfare, the meat delectable with balanced saltiness and flavour like the bright french horns resonating with the bass tubas. I actually like this the most out of the platter, despite the char siew being the hero of the restaurant.\n<br />Roast Duck - the Percussion: to me a supporting player in this symphony as it didn\'t have very meaty parts, but good things come in threes right?\n<br />Classical roast meats that deliver a satisfying rhapsody.
I love the way some parts of the char siew are charred. I love the sweet taste of the sauce that is drizzled over the char siew. Somehow it just kept appear on my mind, asking me to go back for more. How to resist such temptation?!
Late-night cravings. Those succulent, fatty chunks of pork belly, each one complete with a perfectly crunchy, golden-brown crackling.
I was blown away by the authenticity of the roast to HK\'s. The skin of the roast meat was crackling crispy and char siew was well marinated with its smokey sweet sauce. Plus the meat had a balance mixture of lean meat and fat which melts in your mouth.\n<br />Not forgetting to mention, the company which made the dinner session more enjoyable with their endless jokes and contagious laughters.
Sticky, salty, sweet at the same time with a melt in your mouth texture - it\'s a MUST order at Char! üòçüòç #charsg #burpple #charsiew
The Double Blessing($22 excl tax) aka ÂèåÊãº on the restaurant\'s menu is the absolute BOMB! Char siew and roast pork are both mf tender to the extend I was doubting if I\'m actually eating pork! If this is the last meal I will have on my deathbed (touchwood) I really wouldn\'t mind! Lastly, pls make reservations to avoid waiting and don\'t come after 8pm for dinner. PS: they might run out of their signature dishes. I actually had the last order of char siew while the poor couple beside were scowling in discontent as I gave them the diao look 
Succumbed to the Char-acteristic smoky, caramelised texture replete with old world Char-m of wood-roasted meats. This signature Char Siew was indeed off the Char-ts with its melt-in-the mouth texture and its gooey thick Char Siew sauce üòÅ
This was belly belly delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed sinking my teeth through the light crispy skin (and hearing that loud crunch), down to the guilty layer of fatty meat. A belly good dish I must say. 
Just like their Char Siew, the pork belly was tender with right amount of fats &amp; crispy pork crackling, of course! #tbt
Can you believe that I never used to like fatty meats and hardly ate anything with pork in it? Now, give me all the pork belly, the crackling and the lard in the world and I\'ll be beaming to the moon and back.
Aside from that, the roasted duck &amp; pork belly were equally appetizing but the charsiew definitely steal the spotlight of all 3! üòã Can\'t wait to go back for seconds!
üòë Can‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ taste‚Ä¶ it‚Ä¶ on‚Ä¶ the‚Ä¶ tip‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶ my‚Ä¶ tongue‚Ä¶
On Sundays, everyone should eat roasts. My roast of choice? Char\'s Char Siew.
*drools* We swept these off the plate and into our bellies super quickly!
Each slice of char siew had a layer of fat sandwiched between layers of succulent meat with charred, sweet &amp; sticky caramelized sauce enveloping it. \n<br />So good all other char siew I\'ve tried paled in comparison. \n<br />Life-changing char siew indeed.
As the name says, there\'s something special about this super tender, sweet and savoury Char Siew covered in gooey sauce. It\'s perfect for those of us who always go for the charred ends of Char Siew. Will definitely be back for this!
I was told this would be life-changing. I wasn\'t skeptical, but I don\'t think I was quite prepared for just how phenomenal this char siew is.
And also, a night when a deliberate choice was made to put away my mobile camera quickly so that I can focus more on the people around me. üôÜüôÜThank you @burpple! üòòüòò\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />I\'m going to order half kg of char siew and half kg of sio bah for myself next time!No sharing! üòÇüòÇ Insane deliciousness here. üòç #EileenWantsToCampHereForever #FatFatMeatSeries #Fatisfying #Char #TakeMyMoney #burpple #burppletastemaking
All the pre-requisites for a mouthwateringly delicious plate of fried beef noodles were present - oodles of wok hei and smoky aroma wafting from the slightly charred rice noodles, the all important beef slices cooked to meaty perfection but not tenderised to a gelatinous, rubbery death(all too common for this dish), and plenty of onions and bean sprouts for crunch. The menu describes it as \"addictively strong and flavourful\" and they are not wrong.
I am not a \"char siu\" devotee (give me roast pork anytime!) but this glossy black beauty with its off-the-chart tenderness was really something else. 
Simply seasoned, but huge in flavour, the natural sweetness of the prawns shone through. Sucking the head juices out was the best part.
Charsiew could be the main point when one visits Char, but the Roast Pork Belly here is also not to be missed! While aesthetically it looks less attractive than that shiny charsiew, this was pretty different from your usual Roast Pork where coffee shops serve for there is not just Chinese herbs used to marinate this dish, but also \"not so Chinese\" herbs and spices (as claimed in the menu) used as well. The result was a somewhat lighter but still savoury flavour which is significantly less heavy than that of hawker variants, yet leaves you satiating for more. Every slice of meat also comes with a good proportion of meat to fat, while the skin gives that tasteful salty flavour along with a nice crunch when you chew on it. Honey Mustard served alongside is a nice touch, but this was so good that I had it without any dip!
No one ever goes to Char without ordering their signature Char Siew, and that\'s because it\'s life-changing. Even as one who bore really high expectations for this dish for what I have had heard about it, it still was pretty mind-blowing. Never had we seen Char Siew coated in a honey sauce as sticky, nor had we ever tasted Char Siew that was tender it actually really just melted in our mouths; suspected if they actually sous vide their Char Siew since they mentioned using \"modern cooking science\" in its preparation. No matter what it is, this is a  must try before you die!
Given a choice between this and Char\'s signature Special Char Siew, I\'d pick the pork belly anytime of the day for it\'s superb crackling and perfect ratio of fatty to lean meat. I just wish they\'d provide more of that nostril burning mustard.
A classic tzechar dish that well-executed. Flavour was consistent through the entire serving and that you could taste the wok-hei in the dish. While it was really good, this dish pales in comparison with the others for the lack of wow-factor unlike their signature meats
There\'s absolutely no turning back after you have tried the Signature Char Siew ($6 per 100g, minimum order of 300g) from Char Restaurant. Using a combination of modern cooking science with traditional roasting, the glorious fat to meat ratio will lead to a melt-in-your-mouth kinda situation. Say goodbye to dry, red dyed meat as your perspective of char siew will change forever. It almost feels like committing a sin after you have wiped clean this platter.
Ordered another 300g of this (6 of us!) and this was good too - crispy crackling skin, fatty part was melt-in-the-mouth goodness. If I come here again I\'d definitely order this and the charsiew!!! We also had other dishes like beef hor fun which was pretty good (the beef was so tender! And the hor fun itself was tasty) my personal favourite was the aubergine. Everyone else liked the butter chicken but it tasted a little strange to me. Overall, I think it\'s worth a try! Decent place for a nice meal plus service is good. (Hop over to The Tuckshop for some post-dinner beer if you\'d like)
300g of melt-in-the-mouth tender, juicy roasted char siew with a light smokey taste. The sticky sweet marinate was so good!!!
Outer layer is nicely charred with no bitter aftertaste. Meat is tender and savoury. The sauce is sweet and brought out the essence of the whole dish. CALORIES THAT ARE WORTH IT!\n<br />[www.fatliceeats.wordpress.com]
Name: Roasted Char Siew with Rice\n<br />Price: 12SGD
Anyway, trying out Char\'s Shredded Duck Noodle soup ($10) for dinner today while the bf ordered the MUST order special char siew and egg fried rice #somuchnoodles #fatdiehim #clozette #selfie #burpple
This char siew is probably one of the BEST I\'ve ever had in my entire life. Each bite was just simply melt-in-the-mouth, oh. So much love is involved in this. Definitely highly recommended. Too good! üòçüòçüòç\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
quality and consistency check on saturday at char with family. aka my coming 33rd birthday dinner too since actual is on weekday. verdict? quality and consistency, CHECKED! the full house crowd is one sure sign for sure and the char siew is still ridiculously heavenly! the caramelized burnt ends is unmistakable - smokey and such comforting sweetness. be sure to make reservations for table and the char siew too!
Look at that char siew. Tender meat with fat melted in between and with sweet savoury sauce on top. üòãüòã easily the best char siew in singapore. As for the sio bak and roasted duck, they really lack luster in comparison. The sio bak wasn\'t flavourful enough and was too oily. The duck was average. Just go for the char siew next time. :D
Char siew was sweet and charred with bits of fats. Yummy.  But the roast pork was not to my liking. Flavours are not strong enough and skin was not as crispy as I like it to be.
For the price, I find the dish so-so only... though the meat is very tender, the duck is bland and the char siew sauce is too thick.
I didn\'t know char siew could melt in your mouth until today. What makes a good piece of char siew is finding the right balance of meat and fats. Not forgetting the honey marinate that won\'t make overly sweet and gives it a nice char. 
Melt in your mouth goodness, good for sharing in 3s or more as you need to other at least 300g! 100g for $5! 
üéâüéâüéâ Been craving the charsiew for a while now and I\'m so happy my cravings got satisfied tonight! Once again, it didn\'t fail to disappoint. The meat was so tender and so rich it\'s like the pork is having their own party in my mouth! üòÅ
Juicy, tender and sofffttt. This dish needs no description, just head down to eat it to taste for yourself!
Great food, highly rec this place! Had char siew, roast pork, beef hor fun and duck noodle soup. Everything is good! The pricing is reasonable at this casual dining restaurant. Reservation is recommended as the area is not big. 
üíñüíñüíñ Really one of the most tender and soft char siew I\'ve had. It just melts the moment you place it in your mouth! Why are you so far from me, I need to go back noooooow!!
we over ordered!  We couldn\'t decide between 2 kinds of roast meat Or 3 kinds so hubs ordered 3 -char siew( Ooh nice n tender! ) , roast pork ( so so ) n roast duck ( not too bad! ) Hot and sour soup is abit oily and veg is ok but have eaten better . We also ordered a serving of yang zhou fried rice which is laden with oil! I like fried rice that is Á≤íÁ≤íÂàÜÊòé ie rice that is not lumpy and doesn\'t stick  together.. pls make reservations else prepare to wait for a table.
if ur aint tt fussy with oily food, the meats here are really good. a tad oily but I can reminise the familiar taste which comes frm the char siew in kl. as its shop front suggest, char! charred, tender, almost melting in ur mouth char siew. üòÑüòÑüòÑ a happy boy this week. good night folks
Belly good!!!!!
This time round ordered 300g. Will always come back for more!
Crackling siobak,  melt in your mouth charsiew are my faves. Roast duck is not too bad either. Highly recommend!

-\n<br />The chicken was a fantastic texture somewhere between shredded and sliced chicken, a perfect coating of sauce/seasoning, with each mouthful.\n<br />-\n<br />Monster loves his chicken, especially with some spit and saliva\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #char #iluvsg
The beancurd was soft and very well seasoned (it was charcoaled inside as well).. Superb dish with bits of spinach under the beancurd
In fact I think the ones in Hong Kong Roast 88 is way better and cheaper! But the char siew here is to die for.. Succulent and most importantly fat! I would kill to get fat pork in Singapore.. And this was just AMAZING.. Forget the roast pork, just go all in for the char siews

Double platter. Roast pork belly and char siew. This was shiokness. The char siew was marinated nicely and the meat and fats were so soft it melts in your mouth üòå Roast pork belly skin was so crispy and the meat was firm and tender. Comes with mustard sauce and garlic chilli which makes it yummier than it already was. Picture doesnt do this dish justice. Cant wait to go back for more!!
Melt-in-da-mouth but felt it lacked the bite compared to those from the authentic hawker stalls. Roast pork didn\'t have that crackle and failed to impress. Overall felt that their roast meats (triple platter 400-450g $30) wasn\'t as memorable as their bar snacks e.g deep fried PUMPKIN &amp; EGGPLANT with pork floss and mayo $8 which was dangerously addictive.

üîπ\n<br />1st stop. Orlulu char siew total 400g as minimum order was 300g. The sauce was pretty sweet. Very thick slices and not very melty.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />Hmm...just thinking if it was worth going to eat (food not so fantastic) as I walked almost 2km to my destination.  It was lah....the company was awesome.
These bad boys are crispy AF, salty and good balance of meat to fat ratio. (7.9/10)
Enjoying #charsiew at #char üêñ
Something which I would order again.
Decent rendition with tender beef slices and wok hei.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #beef #beefnoodles #beefhorfun #horfun #hawkerfood #burpple
The thing about the char siew is that it is super tender compared to the more common dry and lean variation. Much more convenient to visit now that they have moved to Jalan besar.
After TWO failed attempts to visit CHAR, we finally popped by their brand NEW OUTLET to get our protein fix.
Even the white meat was yummy! \n<br />Gastronometer: 8.5/10

Crackling skin and tender fatty pork is awesome üòç
Heavenly üòç
yessss, that\'s right. Salted Egg Pork üòè the texture is pretty much like Sweet &amp; Sour Pork (battered and deep-fried) but so much better when drenched in salted egg sauce! each bite keeps you asking for more, more, MORE! it is so addictive! I\'m officially pigged-out for today üòã \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie #saltedeggpork #saltedegg
if anyone knows of a resto that serves up as tender, melts-in-your-mouth Char Siew (Roast Pork), please please please let me know where cos i have seriously never had anything quite like this version served up at Char. not many people appreciates the sweetness of their in-house special sauce or even the amount of fats in each piece of meat but I\'m telling you, it\'s definitely worth every.single.calorie! thanks to @burpple for sending me the $30 voucher so I could bring my friends along to enjoy this wonderful dish together! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie #charsiew #roastpork
Went to have a meal at @char_restaurants (salted egg pork ribs/triple roast/kailan) - yummy! üòçüòç Just pretty sad that they are moving out soon though üòØ #burpple #charsg #charrestaurants #charrestaurant
Fatty Char Siew was mind blowing. I\'m salivating thinking of how it melts in my mouth instantly. CHAR does not use the traditional charcoal roasting method but instead 4 different cooking processes, delivering the soft and tender fatty char siew. #BestFoodMemory2015
500g is probably too much for 2 to share but we finished it anyway. #noregrets #charsiew #char #sgfood #sgfoodies #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burpple #Pedigree #beer #latergram #throwback #jamyundies #jamyeats

Using a combination of modern cooking science with traditional roasting, the glorious fat to meat ratio will lead to a melt-in-your-mouth kinda situation. Say goodbye to dry, red dyed meat as your perspective of char siew will change forever. It almost feels like committing a sin after you have wiped clean this platter.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#foodart #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

Good for two hungry people!
Nice roasted meat but other dishes so so only. 
death by heart-stopping fatty char siew. and boy am i willing to die 2 times here with their black gold at the pretty new kid on the block, 7 months old \"Char\". almost like the famous KL ÁéªÁíÉÂèâÁÉßÔºåbut better because while it melts in your mouth, one still get to have some meat fibers here which lends a bite to otherwise just a gluey texture. the caramelized burnt ends were awfully decadent but so lovingly enjoyed together with the uber sweetness sauce that was spot-on and not cloyingly sweet. worthy to mention was their roast pork which was heavenly good too! the meats here really game-changer i tell you. i don\'t usually say this but this is really quite a die-die-must-go place if you want quality char siew
still i find it so oily and you prbably need a vege or rice to go along with it. nonetheless super tender, slightly charred and melts in your mouth. üòÑüòÑüòÑ

Melts in the mouth fatty char siew üòúüòãüòãüòã ..( but I think we still prefer the not so oily #kayleeroastmeat )
Other than the char siew and roast meat, the rest of the dishes were pretty average. #char #foodsg #burpple #omnomnom #eatfirstregretlater
(But that\'s coz the char siew is full of fat)\n<br />Very sinful but still yummy! Luckily we didn\'t over order heh #omnomnom #siyieatsinmoderation #char #charsiew #burpple #foodsg
Delicious, well seasoned Cantonese-style roasted char siew.
