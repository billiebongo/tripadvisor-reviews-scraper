Staying warm this evening with a lovely, flavoursome Double-boiled Clear Broth of Chicken with Sea Whelk &amp; Fish Maw from #LiBai #SheratonSG. #CNY2016
I honestly do not usually order Eggs Benedict nor do I actually order room service. Decided to try it this time round during staycation after Company\'s DND and I was quite satisfied with this! Muffins were soft, topped with ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. Alongside with crispy hashbrowns, grilled asparagus and tomatoes. 
I know many people don\'t like nuts mooncakes but I like them. \n<br />I was telling my colleague who is from India to try it out. He was skeptical but grew to like it! \n<br />#keropokmanMooncakes
They have both white and yellow seed paste for their mooncakes. \n<br />I know some only like white ones. There are others who prefer the olden style yellow. This particular one uses the yellow lotus seed paste. \n<br />The cranberries gave it a nice slight tart and sweetness to paste. \n<br />#keropokmanMooncakes
Their mooncakes has been popular too. This year, Chef Chung Yiu Ming and his culinary team is continuing their tradition of handcrafting mooncakes. \n<br />There are two designs and this is what I call the \'maze\' pattern. Very traditional. \n<br />#keropokmanMooncakes
Here are some of the mooncakes from #LiBai @sheratontowerssg. \n<br />1. Mixed nuts (传统五仁）\n<br />2. White lotus seeds paste with double egg yolks (传统双黄白莲蓉)\n<br />3. Yellow lotus seeds paste with cranberry (传统蔓越莓黄莲蓉)\n<br />4. Green tea and black sesame lotus seeds paste with melon seeds (传统瓜子肉绿茶黑芝麻莲蓉). My favourite is the green tea and black sesame one! Well, the combination is like made for me. 🙊 If you\'re a big fan of matcha and black sesame, do give this a try!😋👍🏻 .
Whilst the red date mooncake evoked strong Yeo\'s Longan Red Date drink feels (hmmm, freshly prepared?), the yuzu mooncake was a flash of refreshing citrusy lightning and the champagne mooncake releases upon bite a remarkably formidable dosage of alcohol from its moonly prison.
8 treasures duck with abalone that cuts like butter! Love! Www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio!
What decadence! The entire experience was enhanced with the presence of foodie friends, some of whom I haven\'t seen in a while. #foodporn #sonyrx100m2
Had this platter by 李白, I heard he is really famous for whipping up yummy food for wedding dinners. And yes! The smoked duck and the prawn roll was the best I\'ve ever had. People who looking at dishes for wedding banquet do take note of this! 
Loving the buttery and crumbly tart crust of the fruit mince pies the lovely girls at Sheraton Towers sent. I used to think that mince pies have minced meat in them! That would be really ideal actually. Haha.
Another dish that I was pretty skeptical initially because it instead of the usual pork siu mai since I\'m more of a siu Mai person. This one is made with chicken. However, it tasted pretty good with fish roe and scallops. I would recommend this dish even for those who prefer traditional type of dim sum.
The dumplings here are slightly bigger than the average xiao long baos but the skin did not break even though it was not too thick. The crabmeat soup stock in the dumpling was very good too. The dim sums here are generally quite good and not too pricey, definitely a place I would come back again. 
I was pleasantly surprised by this dish, since it didn\'t appealed much to me when browsing through the menu. The crunchy dragon beard and fresh scallop somehow makes it a great combination. Must try!
Not many places serve this type of BBQ pork bun, which I prefer over the steamed version. The one here comes with sweet barbecued pork glaze with onions (?) in a light fluffy bun with crispy crust. Overall not too bad but not as good as the one from Tim Ho Wan. 
Braised King prawn and sweet potato with hairy crabmeat and crab roe.
Everyone had a bright eye when they bite into it. Yummy.
Nothing come close when it\'s claypot rice at Li Bai. They use \"fresh\" (pun intended) cured pork meat, sausage, liver sausage, and duck. Preparation is simple, these cured meat (臘味) are simply placed on top of the rice, when the rice is almost cooked in these heavy claypots (cooked from scratch, so you\'ll need to give at least 30 min for preparation time when ordering), and let all the flavours and oil infuse into the rice below. When ready, a special soy sauce will be added. The cured meat are served separate from the rice with poached Kai-Lan (kyle). It\'s a traditional offering only available from the autumn/ entering winter, which means the year is almost over, my friends.
All the favourite ingredients, how can you resist this?
I renamed this fried roll as a bouquet, as it\'s really beautiful. Not only is it pleasing to the eyes, the dim sum chef has constantly seek improvement to make this taste so good.
Truly ingenuity by my favorite dim sum master. Using seasonal fruit might sound a tat gimmickish, but not in this excellent creation, which maintains the savoury flavours and introducing a sweetness that is subtle but characteristic.
$63 per box. Unique packaging from Li Bai, a well known Chinese restaurant. But feel that the mooncake tastes a bit too sweet.
One of the best fusion interpretation of an oriental classic dessert. Originally served hot with coconut drizzled on top of a bed of black glutinous rice sweet congee, this is served cold with the coconut milk ice-cream accentuating the flavours of this unique dessert.
Fresh scallop are naturally sweet. Steaming &amp; lightly sauté are perhaps the best ways to cook scallops. 李白 Li Bai has perfected it in this creation.
After having this, you wonder what the hype on THW dim sum is all about. 
Still as good as ever. This is their signature and a fixture in the menu (after a customers feedback that to remove this item, they might as well do away with har kow and siew mai. Bhawahaha). These dumplings\' succulent skin capsulize ingredients such as sautéed French bean, turnip, tofu (dao kwa), mushroom.
Auspicious dish frequently ordered in celebration of Chinese Birthdays. Scallops were cooked to perfection with vermicelli immersed in flavorful broth, topped off with steamed egg in a corner of the plate.
Easy dish to kick off the palatte. Go try it at Li Bai
Ladies will love this, gentlemen too lah.. Chefs at #LiBai prepared this Braised Superior Bird\'s Nest with Crabmeat and Crab Roe for us.
This was a delicious treat tonight. Stewed \"8 Treasures\" Chicken 🐔with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber. At #LiBai #sheraton #singapore
1st CNY tasting of 2014! And instead of Pen Cai, we\'re having a Stewed \'Eight Treasures\' Chicken with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber that smells heavenly 😌
Traditional steamed hairy crab from Li Bai. Love this seasonal delicacy? Stay tuned to Six&amp;Seven for our #hairycrab feature!
Gyoza-style fan fried dumpling filled with fresh whole scallop and shrimp. Wholesome goodness. Unforgettable aroma of the olive vegetable and olive oil!  
Most interesting and visually pleasurable. Edible charcoal infused skin, each encapsulate two whole scallops and sliced asparagus. 
Baked Pastry filled with minced spring onion! Yum...
Love their flavor and unique texture of the noodle; and the fresh shrimps of course.
Still the best after all these years, having tried the thousand and one other restaurant that does this.
Succulent cassava (tapioca) flour skin filled with goodness of ingredients including scallop, snow pea, water chestnut, wolf berry, butter squash and beancurd.
Tried out a new place for dim sum. Pretty good food though slightly more expensive (~$6-$8 per dish excluding the meat dishes). Good ambience and food was served very quickly.
the downside of #chinese courses is one tend to overeat.. #typical
Mediocre at best. Don\'t waste your calories on this. Wanton noodles better.

I was somewhat surprised with the green tea infused Niao Gao coated with a thin layer of egg. The texture is almost like having mochi, soft and slightly chewy.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cny #niangao
