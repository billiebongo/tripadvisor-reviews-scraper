Drop by Bedok hawker centre this evening to have our dinner after visiting the Pokemon event (available from 18 movement - 11 February 2017) at Changi Airport\n<br />.\n<br />Having peanut sauce feast with Satay and Satay Bee Hoon. The peanut gravy for the bee hoon is indeed yummy and for $4 per plate the stall owner definitely is not stingy with their ingredients. #cuisineparadiseeatout #sgfood #hawkerfood #foodblogger #burpple #sgfoodies
First time trying the highly raved 剪刀剪 Curry Rice which is famous in Beach Road. This outlet is located in the new foodcourt in Bedok Interchange, just beside Lao Ban Beancurd.

This amazing sliced fish congee is a great comfort food for this sick human being, and eating the dough fritter with the porridge is 😍😍😍. Costs only $3!\n<br />They have other stuff too, like handmade meatball congee and pig intestine.
4.5 munchies: So glad that I finally got to try this plate of greasy goodness at one of Julius\' #TastyTastemakerTour stops this afternoon. If you like your chai tow kway black and dam dam (moist), then do join in the 20-minute waiting line!
The only way to \"shortcut\" the usual 20-deep queue at #01-48. Still prefer the MLXG though.
This poached fish came in a set with 2 side dishes which I chose mashed potatoes &amp; pasta 🍝 It\'s $6 only but the portion might be slightly small for some. Definitely coming back here again! 👻
Might be better with lesser starch. Small and more oysters. Depends on what you like, I will prefer those that I tried at blk 85 bedok market before. Will not go back again. 
Brought our tourist friends to try out the local flavours. Mee Soto, rojak and the fried carrot cake were superb. Perfect place to go for if you wanna try out different kind of food without costing too much. 
Affordable priced and comes with a chock full of ingredients from the refreshing chilled cucumber strips to chunks of that minced meat gravy. Before eating, do mix some of that chilli and chilli oil with the noodles for an even better flavour.\n<br />.\n<br />Zhong Hua Noodle House\n<br />Address: 208B, New Upper Changi Road, Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre, Unit 01-33, Singapore 462208
Sigh... Gave in to temptation... It\'s okay, I work out to eat. 😜 Nice char kuey teow at only S$ 3! @.@ #burpple #burpplesg #donttellmypersonaltrainer
The best thus far, the taste and texture has been consistent all these years. At least the lady serving is way polite than before! The carrot cake is well fried, with a tint of burnt. That forms the crisp. Generous amount of fried raddish that makes the whole dish crunchy, salty and sweet in taste. 
.\n<br />|\n<br />Currently my favorite stall for pork soup. Braised tofu, peanut and a bowl of pork soup only costed $6.80. Daily fresh pork which helped to reduce any smelly pork smell. The preserved cabbage based soup excited the appetite. Every side was excellent. Especially their braised tofu, all its individual holes was filled with the sauce. However, their Bak Kut Teh was something  which I wouldn\'t want to try again. .\n<br />|\n<br />同心園.\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />🏠: Bedok Town Centre Hawker Centre \n<br />208 New Upper Changi Rd # 01-42, Singapore 460209.\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />⏰: Daily 1000H to 2100H
Ordered the Pacific Clam and Prawn Beehoon Noodle for S$ 5. Was disappointed... Too bland for my tastebuds,  only finished a quarter of the bowl. The one at the Penang\'s Kitchen is more to my liking. #burpple #burpplesg
🎉 A forever hungry like me will always crave for another food adventure. I keep on coming back to Bedok Hawker Centre for these siew mai from Tiong Bahru Pau stall. Just for $0.80 each, you can have a tasty, chunky, satisfying siew mai. They were served warm, not hot. Perfect for those who cannot delay gratification! 😜 I wanted to try other food to be partnered with my siew mai, running away from my usual siew mai-pork pau tandem. Then, I saw this Poh Kee stall with an accommodating uncle, who really tried his best to speak English after realising that I\'m not local. ☺️ I gave his Shredded Chicken Noodle a try. It was not as spicy as I thought but it was flavourful and filling for a $3-meal. 😋 And ohh, my all time favourite iced coffee will always be an omnipresent treat. ☕️\n<br />#foodadventure #burpple #saturyay #simplejoys
JOOHZ\'s Vitamin Booster ($3.80), a refreshing and pleasantly sour juice of green apple, lemon and baby spinach!! Great pick-me-up on a hot day.
Now, am I using the term correctly? 😜\n<br />Pork BBQ Pau ($1) is from the stall, Tiong Bahru Pau. I also bought Siew Mai ($0.80) but I already consumed before I remember to take photo. HAHA 😂 #RainySunday #Ohno #burpple
Proceeded to order the Thai Basil Leaves Minced Pork Rice with Egg ($5.50), which came up pretty good, except they have gone quite heavy on the seasoning. If you eat it plain without the rice, it can be quite salty but the issue can be easily rectified by getting them to make it less saltier by adding lesser salt or soya sauce. My first visit was quite disappointing as this dish happens to be one of my favourite Thai orders but I will give it a second go soon and getting them to make it less salty.
[Song Zhou Luo Bo Gao, #01-37] - $3, black carrot cake. This was pretty good, greasy and sweet just the way it should be but I probably should have added more eggs. 
Delicious and traditional fried kway tiao, fried carrot cake and fried oyster. Must try if you\'re in the area!
From Happy Dessert at Bedok Interchange Food Centre. Slightly more liquid than the usual, the flavours of yam seemed a little blander but still pretty evident which also means it\'s less sweet which is ideal for the health conscious. 
At the price of $3.50, the plentiful portion is especially satisfying. \n<br />Handmade noodles and the homey broth make the bowl of noodles especially hearty and welcoming. Comes with a runny egg, fresh veggies and a cooked-through, yet tender minced pork. \n<br />The amazing service by the Aunty who owns the store sure is the ikan bilis on top of the banmian! Truly a bowl of goodness that feels like it just came out of your grandma\'s pot.
Seems like the \"Lor\" from Penang Kitchen is really good with the right amount of umami!Many ingredients too, noteworthy was definitely the crunchy fried tofu skin and the tender pork belly that comes with a perfect bite! \n<br />And I loved how it is damn shiok with plenty of chili, vinegar and garlic! Guess I\'m the real Vampire Killer today! \"HAHHHHH.....\" 😹
Shit\'s piling up from school, it\'s stressful as fuck and it\'s not over yet. 😲🔫\n<br />Also, congratulations to myself for having completed my first test with 0 confidence in any of my answers. Good bye bell curve. 🔕\n<br />Anyhow, here\'s a picture of a wanton mee I liked in the new bedok interchange hawker centre. Can go check it out for a #budget meal. \n<br />#noodles #burpple
Noted this stall that serves all things Malaysian in Bedok Interchange Food Centre. Their Ipoh Hor Fun is served in both dry or wet variants and in two portion sizes ($3 or $4). I like how thick the sauce is, dark and flavourful with slurpy rice noodles that is smooth to down. Accompanying the Hor Fun was the Sambal; one which tasted more raw but somehow lacked the punch.
All the way from jurong to bedok for this favourite lor mee! Fried fish lor mee with loads of delicious things inside is very suitable for brunch, it is yummy and cheap! Cafe hopping may be in trend now but hawker is still my favourite place where you can feel the differences of traditional condition, delicious and wide variety of food, and at cheap price! #hawkerpedia
Large bowl of porridge with a generous portion of 皮蛋，along with some crunchy oily you tiao! We found the handmade (evident with its uneven spherical shape) meatballs and fishballs a tad too salty but decent #hawkercomfort 
More ban Mian madness this week. Here at Bedok Interchange lies an extremely popular Ban Mian store, with its signature yellow bowl. Found the soup to be a little bland initially, but the flavours started to come out after letting the bowl sit for a while. The texture of the noodles was soft, perhaps slightly too soft for me towards the end. Not the most satisfying bowl out there, but definitely one of the better ones. 
Love the sauce they use here, along with some Chilli and you are in for a sincere and good treat @$3.50! Always thought it would be great if my mee Hoon Kueh came in thin neat squares but I guess that\'s just not the way it\'s suppose to be! Looking forward to try their u-mian the next visit (-:

[Bedok Interchange Food Centre] Amidst all the restaurants, cafes and desserts, sometimes it\'s good to take the simpler side of things and have a bowl of Sliced Fish Noodles ($3.50). It might look bland but wait till you try the perfectly seasoned fish stock with those huge chunks of sliced fish, it can be a pretty satisfying meal too.
[Bedok Interchange Food Centre] No matter how bad the weather is or how humid the food centre can get, it\'s not stopping me from having a hearty bowl of Zhong Xin Ban Mian ($3.50). Not my top choice for handmade noodles but this will suffice for me. People who frequent the food centre will know that this is one of the stalls that closes the latest, serving the supper crowd everyday.
I know it\'s difficult to believe that one YTF can taste better than another. Afterall it\'s pretty much the same ingredients, blanched in water and topped with similar tasting gravy. But this store at Bedok Interchange 青天 have officially stole the title of the most value for money YTF for 2 very simple reasons, freshness of ingredients and the great tasting soup. The selection of ingredients weren\'t the widest, each selection is definitely fresh and flavourful. The store also boasts to boil their soup with corn, chicken bones and soy and you can taste the yummy flavours in every spoonful you take. 
Weekends are usually kept for eggs and pancakes, but on a rainy cold morning like this, a piping hot bowl of lor mee seems much more appealing. I\'ve been eating from this stall since I was in kindergarten. It\'s nice, probably not the best, but really comforting. (I can\'t tag hawker stalls for nuts and I don\'t know the name of the stall so sorry! It\'s a few stalls to the left of the penang lor mee stall.)
I\'m not usually a fan of carbs (empty calories and all that shiz) but this, I gotta say, would make anyone\'s day. I don\'t go hawker-hopping so I\'m no pro, but the curry chicken noodles at Bedok interchange\'s hawker centre is absolutely delish. And it\'s near home. What I would do for a bowl of that right now...
90cents each these AKK from 发 wasn\'t that fragrant/ satisfying!!! On a search for some good AKK....
Decent but nothing fantastic, noodles towards the soft,dense instead of springy side.. Wanton skin smooth but meat didn\'t taste fresh. 
Good morning, everybody! Breakfast for westies while we plan our route of attack on cafes in the east.
Newly renovated Bedok interchange food centre 
And this is the X-section! Fluffy on the inside!!
Curry was cooked with just enough coconut and flavor. Chicken pieces was generous.
Eyed this e moment i stepped into the hawker centre but find it too small for lunch. Unfilling and \'meh\' kuay chap affirmed i must have this Oyster sauce char siew pau 蚝油叉烧包. $0.90 is certainly ex for its petite size but the juicy filling made me da-bao another 6 😱
The soup base is not too salty, yet savory. The noodles were springy and ingredients were fresh and in abundance. The chilli and the small limes enhanced the taste very much. In summary, there was no drop in quality of food, except it tastes less oily as compared to before (before renovations)
Perfectly refreshing on a hot day ($2.50)
Simply lovely braised pork parts. So flavorful &amp; fragrant. 
Noodles comes in $3 a plate/bowl while soup or a-la-cartes are at $3/$3.50 a plate/bowl. At the newly relocated Bedok Central Food Centre, Poh Kee Traditional Wanton Noodle is still a hit with the crowds for the Wanton Mee ($3) here. The wanton is rather average but the char siew is yummy, the noodles are springy and when mixed with the chilli, packs a punch!
The lightly-toasted bread was light and crisp on the exterior. While the Kaya is generic, the spread was really generous. They need a bit of consistency with the butter though; this slice was thick but the other was nearly devoid of it.
My fren ordered this excellent fish and chips that has this garlic sauce which just blew me away. He gave me some to eat with my noodles and I can say it tasted quite well together!
Awesome fried carrot cake at the old Bedok Interchange Food Ctr. It\'s moist with some char crispy parts, yet you can taste the crunchiness of fried raddish (cai poh). S$2.50 a portion, we no longer waste our calories on mediocre fried carrot cake! Seriously not to be missed. Think the stall is closed on Sundays.
Cheap and affordable mee rebus! My bf likes to top up $0.50 for more chicken 😄 
I will say that I was really disappointed by this old stall, despite the above average taste, the serving given for a $4 meal in the hawker centre was not generous as I thought it would be, I will recommend this who doesn\'t like to queue during peak hours.
In the actual fact, stewing is one of the hardest to master. Within a pot, there are different ingredients. They have different rate of absorbing the gravy. Some are faster, others might take hours. \n<br />Take for example this dish. \n<br />Dried bean curds (豆干) might take less than a hour but the small intestines (小肠) might take more than 2 hours. \n<br />Able to control every single one of them to reach the same texture and the flavor of the gravy fully penetrate through take years of experience. \n<br />That\'s why I love this dish! Everyone of them is just right!
But in the past, it was one of the poor people delicacies. Preparing organs takes much more effort than normal cut of meat. \n<br />Washing, cutting and cooking the organs might take hours. However, the kind of fattiness and texture can\'t be find easily in other part of meat. \n<br />This entire set only costed S$3.90! Super worth eating. Every single ingredient was fully flavored with the gravy (卤汁). One mouth of the guotiao (粿条), one mouth of the soup and finish with any of the stewed ingredient. Prefect!!!

Finally been to Bedok Mall lady night for dinner. After that bought supper home! 😆 [耗煎 S$3] - servings quite generous!
I like this kind of wet hokkien mee and the mix of yellow noodle with the mi fen is just right!
One of my favorite Hokkien mee around. The old uncle fries the noodles extremely well! It is a one of those family business worth patronizing.
Thumbs up for the spicyness, begedel and soup. Enjoyed my meal. Satisfied. Cost $2.50. 👍
In this stall Poh Kee wanton mee @ #01-18, There is a small prawn in each dumpling unlike other prawn dumpling which had half a prawn or less. The minced meat is well marinated. Overall this bowl of 6 medium size dumplings at $3 per bowl is value for money.

Satay is somewhat tender with some charred edges. The seasoning is unique as it tasted abit \'pork\' like??

This certainly has all the traits of a proper Penang laksa! (Although I still haven\'t tried the ones in Penang!😕) the gravy has a nice balance of sour/sweet/sour/ salty profile and it is concentrated with bits and pieces of kembong fish that makes every slurp count!

What makes this Bakchormee special is that the owner actually painstakingly prepares hundreds of hand-made meatballs and fishballs to serve with their noodles. This adds a different textural dimension to the dish. Anyway always ask for more vinegar and chili.!

The sauce below gave the noodles a savoury taste when tossed with the ingredients, though it lacked more flavour and spiciness to it.
Singaporean definitely knows this dessert and many variations of cendol  creations has been created.

Pork &amp; chicken satay from Jit Sing Satay 日新炭烤沙爹, #01-51
It might look bland but wait till you try the perfectly seasoned fish stock with those huge chunks of sliced fish, it can be a pretty satisfying meal too.\n<br />|\n<br />.\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link
Not my top choice for handmade noodles but this will suffice for me. People who frequent the food centre will know that this is one of the stalls that closes the latest, serving the supper crowd everyday.\n<br />|\n<br />.\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link
Craving for carrot cake.
Still like my pontian.  This mee is traditional,  not QQ. #sgfoodies #sgfood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #hungrygowhere #burpple #whati8today #openricesg #igsg #sgigfoodies #sgig #sgeatout #sgeats #8dayseatout #sgfoodscene #sg50 #sghawkers #bedokhawker #foodvsco #vscocam #eatoutsg #sgfoodunion #jamyundies #sggluttons #danielfooddiary #sgbrand

Basically it\'s steamed rice cakes with preserved radish and the chili is relatively good. I love this a lot!
Best around Bedok Estate!
This is from the stall with a blue signboard specializing only in nasi lemak. The chilli is awesome! Sweet and spicy with onions, ikan bilis and peanuts mixed in.
Healthy lunch at newly revamp bedok market

One of the best fried carrot cake I ever try.. 
Our favorite Hokkien Prawn Noodles from Bedok Interchange Hawker Center. The traditional taste is still there after so many years. Old granny is still cooking to-date but she\'s only doing so in the day. 难得阿婆还在自己的摊子继续炒传统福建虾面。#Hokkien #prawnnoodles #noodles #Gardenia #Gardeniamakan #makan #foodposting #traditional #Singapore #Bedok #好吃 #传统 #福建 #炒虾面 #面 #勿洛 #新加坡

Yummy!
Simple brunch!
Just as I was digging into my (also disappointing😑) kway chap, I realized that I unwittingly ate 4 EGGS today 😱😱😱
Disappointing braised duck (yam)rice - proof that long queue does not equate to good food😞
Dinner/supper - piping hot curry noodles with chicken not a fan of this dish but it was really yummy
