How every weekend should be like 😌 (but with a better tasting cuppa) - this was a tad too pricey and too sweet.
Surprised that this black charcoal sesame bun and crispy battered fish is so nicely done. 
Beef Mini Burgers ($12.80) &amp; Lobster Bisque ($5.80). Mini Burgers were great for a light dinner. Lobster Bisque could have been thicker but it was still good! Plus, they were showing LIVE football! 
I think I deserve some good food. \n<br />Their chili crab pizza is seriously good, better than the Hawaiian in my opinion. Tiramisu is a disappointment. Love the cute latte art though.
Nothing fantastic. I\'m not sure what\'s the hype about it, seriously.
😌 This [Flaming Pizza] from @atmospherebistrosg is probably one of the coolest around! As the name suggests, the pizza is served with a flame on it! Sadly the sea breeze was too strong for the flame to sustain. 😂 but it\'s ok. As long as I get my pizza in the end.🍕😌
What more can I ask for. ☺️ The boy and I had [ATMOSPHERE BURGER], [FLAMING PIZZA], [MISO SALMON], [TRUFFLE FRIES] #onthetable that\'s not counting the [baby back ribs], [lobster bisque] and 2 desserts that we had. 😂😋 We were impressed with our appetites too. 😅 A pity that we didn\'t get to enjoy the cute latte arts (only available on weekend), but the Kirin frozen beers were really good!🍻 ps:rmb to have a reservation before coming down to @atmospherebistrosg to prevent disappointment. It\'s really crowded! 👍
You have seen birthday cakes on fire (candles) but have you seen a pizza on fire. Splashed with generous toppings of shrimps, salami, capsicum and assorted mushrooms, this signature flaming pizza at Atmosphere Bistro makes a perfect sharing with family and friends.
Yes we stood on the chair to take this picture. How many of you actually do the same? We are not afraid of people judging us.
Ranging from 2D gingerbread man and Stitch to 3D cats, bears and pigs. What can they not do? Totally amazed!
Good Monday Morning! Before I go MIA a while again, here\'s a [ATMOSPHERE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE S$11.80] - not overly sweet nor cloying, chocolate is good, doesn\'t taste fake, taste best when shared among friends!  😆. Limited quantities daily and best of all the ipad (used to order food) reflects the number of lava cakes available👍
Didn\'t expect to get only one strawberry. But the lava cake was yummy! It did flow. The cake layer wasn\'t very thick, so it didn\'t end up like some other lava cakes which were merely moist chocolate cakes.
Cute latte art to accompany us on Saturday evening! [ICED LATTE S$7] + [Coffee Art S$1] 
Lovely breeze and nice view of the seaside. The latte art here is really good. They even have 3D ones!
Not wanting to pay S$1 for 3D art? Just settle for the 2D! [LATTE S$6]
The Atmosphere Burger ($22.80) is just plain intimidating. They only make a limited quantity each day and I was the second last to order it today. A triple stacked burger of pork, turkey and chicken patties, the meat was smeared with citrus BBQ sauce and served with a charcoal bun. Not for the faint hearted.
Our hearts just skipped a beat when we saw the super cute latte art on our coffee.

Not just pretty but tasty too. Gonna order the other flavours on my next visit.\n<br />Mentaiko waffle was so good, sauce is a little salty for me though.

This Matcha lava is too sweet for my liking but the flavors are ON point. 😺 do I even make sense?
If you are looking for a bistro out of the busy city, Atmosphere Bistro is for you. The bistro feels serene, windy and relaxing. It looks more like a retreat over the weekend than a bistro. .\n<br />Mentaiko Pulled Pork Burger at S$24.80++\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine?\n<br />Atmosphere Bistro\n<br />920 East Coast Parkway #01-25/26/27, Singapore 449875\n<br />.\n<br />#atmospherebistrosg #sgcafe #mentaiko #briochebun #frenchfries #cafesg #foodgemsg
Gula Melaka sauce is then torched and poured on ❤️💋☝🏼Alcohol is so strong though!
And there you have the leaning tower of BUTTERMILK waffle burger, which is my FAVORITE OUT OF THEIR SELECTION OF NEW BURGERS!
We talk without putting words into action. We are selfish.
The exterior contained just the barest hint of crisp and smokey taste, but the winning point was the sweetness of the chewy, tender squid itself.
The creation was enticing, refreshing, comprising of two of my favorite items but I wish the bacon was crispy instead of “smoked ham textured” – this resulted in the pork slice being utterly soft against the melty scallops and both items were nearly indistinguishable in texture.
😲
So cute😘\n<br />Now you know where to head to for brunch and dinner! 😉
❤️\n<br />.\n<br />Super cute latte art and great tasting coffee ☺️\n<br />.\n<br />#atmospherecafe #burpple #cafehopping #cafes #coffee #coffeeart #cute #caffeine #coffeeartporn #cutecoffee #exploresingapore #Exsgcafes #foodporn #foodstagram #instadaily #instafood #instacute #igers #latteart #love #nomnom #onthetable #potd #sgfg #sgigfoodies #sgcafe #vscosg #vscofood #valentines #3dLatteArt
Rainbow cake and Churros Sunday. 
Cycled past this place couple of times and always wanted to chilli it here. Nice and quiet morning to catch up with a bit of trip planning. #breakfast #brunch #singaporeaneats #sgfood #sgfoodies #eggs #eggsbenedict #burpple #food #foodie #foodstagram #foodsofig #hungry #foodporn
Can\'t can enough of their crispy fries from the fish burger that we ordered another round of fries.
Thin and crispy crust serve with spicy sauce. Yums
Creamy and the seasoning is just nice.

Chix mini burgers. Prefect size.
Hello sunday :)
You definitely need an extraordinary huge appetite to polish this off by yourself!💪
Good food. #burpple #tingzieeats @leenzsim

Haha. @tangsher #burpple #tingzieeats
Cosy bistro and bar place which alloes you to enjoy the natural air-con and the nice view of the sea!\n<br />Starting with the appetisers, truffle fries were pretty decent! Could smell its rich truffle oil aroma when it was being served to us! As for the mains, the wangyu beef burger with charcoal buns went well too! Juicy beef patty going well with the cheese and tomatoes, creating some sort of savoury burst to our taste buds. For pizza wise, tho i admit it doesnt taste as good as pizza hut, i like its crust being thin and crispy at the same time! Lastly, the desserts were pretty good. Lava cake came with a generous portion of flowy chocolate fudge with the cake being soft and fluffy! Rainbow cake was pretty typical but i like its soft and buttery texture and its aesthetic plating as well! 😉\n<br />#sgfood #burrple #cafehopping #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igfoodies #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #vscocam #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgig
Crazy frenzy. Super full. #burpple @kurorui @thumberlinario
With @leenzsim #burpple
[MINI BURGERS S$11.80] - 3 mini burgers with BBQ glazed grilled patty, choice of chicken/beef. My favourite among all the savouries we had! Yum yums! 
[FLAMING PIZZA S$22.80] 
They only make a limited quantity each day and I was the second last to order it today. A triple stacked burger of pork, turkey and chicken patties, the meat was smeared with citrus BBQ sauce and served with a charcoal bun. Not for the faint hearted.
