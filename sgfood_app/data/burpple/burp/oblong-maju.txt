Taste heavenly good that suits my liking and definitely worth the price! 
As with the usual charcoal waffles, it usually isn\'t anything fancy beyond the visual appeal. Aside from the lack of a distinct flavour, the texture of this waffle was spot on. A nicely crisp top with super aerated and fluffy insides.
Very cool interior and a rather hidden place but definitely good for late night dessert! Wide variety of flavors available you\'ll be spoilt for choice :  ) 
So yummyyy, the red velvet waffle is filled with cream cheese 😋
We tried Oblong\'s new Tiramisu waffle on our visit last week. Essentially coffee-flavoured waffles with a spread of light chocolate cream, this waffle was a pleasant surprise. The coffee was extremely pronounced in the batter, lending to a bittersweet flavour that\'s balanced perfectly by the chocolate cream and accompanying ice cream. I\'ve never been the biggest fan of flavoured batter, but I gotta say Oblong you got me with this one. I enjoyed mine with a scoop of Banana Nutella ice cream, which also exceeded expectations.
It\'s a total novelty (cause these don\'t taste chocolatey at all; which btw is what red velvet should taste of), which tasted better than I thought it would! Oblong\'s waffles aren\'t your super crisp on the outside ones, rather just fluffy and soft. The two slices of red velvet waffles came with a pleasant cream cheese sauce slathered between. Topped with an amazingly fragrant and exaggerated earl grey lavender ice cream, it makes one of the better ice cream waffle combos I\'ve tried.
Red Velvet Waffle with Cream Cheese and Earl Grey Lavender Ice Cream. Super yummy dessert that I got to have every other week 🍦🍰
Charcoal Waffles + Chocolate Sauce + Matcha Ice Cream 》$8
Waffle Combo 》$10\n<br />Red Velvet Waffle + Strawberry Sauce + Root Beer Float Ice Cream + Drink
Can\'t remember the name of the Ice cream. But it\'s heavenly good! Seriously nice.
Headed to oblong cafe after our dinner because we were craving smth sweet! We ordered the classic buttermilk waffle and I must say the waffle is super good!! It\'s so crispy and it pairs so well with the dark chocolate ice cream we ordered. They\'ve other waffle flavours too like red velvet, charcoal etc... The price is quite reasonable too, it\'s 10 bucks for the waffle and a scoop of ice cream!!☺️☺️😊😊
Ordered buttermilk waffle but major disappointment. Waffle is too soggy. Batter doesn\'t have enough texture. Ice cream was good though. 
This cafe opens till late at Serangoon Gardens serves wonderful waffles with ice-cream. The red velvet waffle is fluffy and is a perfect match with the cream cheese sauce. Topped with Rocky road and earl grey lavender ice-cream 😋😋😋 /\n<br />The older generation clubbers would go down memory line with the \"rebel-like\" mixes playing in the background.

with my matcha waffle \"kiap\" with azuki beans and topped with milo dino ice cream 😋 and the start of the long weekends 🙌
Finally got a chance to eat charcoal waffles. With a single scoop ice cream of your choice, it only cost $8. And damn, it\'s so worth it. 
Oblong is known for their waffles and ice cream especially their Red Velvet waffles but I went for their Bamboo Charcoal variant this time, pairing it with Matcha ice cream
The waffle taste was meh :/ though they have many variety of flavor. However the creamy ice cream was good. 👍👍
I worked there for a short period of time and I would say that my favorite will definitely be the red velvet waffles with cream cheese! There are 4 flavours to choose from: Charcoal, Matcha, Buttermilk &amp; Redvelvet. The pricing is also quite reasonable ($4.50-$4.70 for waffles) and they come in combos for just $10 (includes waffles, a scoop of ice-cream and a drink). Furthermore, it\'s open till the wee hours which means a good place to chill after dinner!
If you ever needed a place to chill out at Serangoon Gardens, why not head down to Oblong and have a Chocolate Molten Lava Cake ($4.50) with some Spooky Dark Chocolate Ice Cream? The person who created the molten lava concept is a genius. Luscious, seductive and captivating!
Even though this is in liquid form, surely the Lemon Pie Ice Cream ($3.30) is able to make it into my key lime/lemon tarts list? It may not be exactly be in tart form but the deconstructed version is a scoop of pure genius. 
Waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Icecream was not too sweet. Overall was good, can finish everything by myself! Their red velvet waffle with cream and strawberry filling is their best seller. Rating: 3.8/5
Waffles definitely weren\'t crisp and the abundance of cream cheese layered in between turned it into a soggy heap. Taste wise wasn\'t too bad, but got pretty heavy on the stomach with the dense waffles and jelat cream cheese. I paired it with lychee mojito ice cream which was rather refreshing and light. 
Ice cream here was sub average, wasn\'t smooth enough but at least not icy. The ice cream display looked rather sad and stale. Got the butterscotch pecan which I thought was the best and had pretty fresh nuts. Waffles looked  crisp but deflated really quickly. The batter was too dense for my liking but was rather fragrant! The whole vibe of the place reminds me of 77th street - blaring music and layout. 
MY FAVORITE RED VELVET cream cheese WAFFLE with ice cream! I super love this waffle. This picture doesn\'t do justice to this. But I brought many friends here to eat. And all of them love it! It\'s so good:) ! 
Oblong Cafe is a very humble and quaint cafe located at Serangoon Gardens opposite myvillage. I dropped by with my dad after seeing drool-inducing photos of their waffles on Instagram, one of them being the Red Velvet Waffles
Strawberries and fresh cream sandwiched by 2 freshly made buttermilk waffles and drizzled with maple sauce sealing the deal in. A scoop of white chocolate and blueberry to sweeten the deal. The waffles magically disappeared within minutes between the 2 of us.
I love the waffles and the ice cream- felt that the waffles could have a stronger red velvet taste but it\'s one of the better waffles tasted. The only problem is the ventilation of Oblong! &gt;
Topped with \"gold label\" honeycomb ice cream! \"Gold labelled\" ice cream +60 cents more to the single scoop of $3.30.
This is simply amazing! Think of red velvet cake but in waffles form. Cream cheese is slathered generously in between the red velvet waffles. Topped with an ice cream and syrup of your choice- mine was sea salt caramel ice cream and maple syrup. It goes perfectly together - says my tastebuds. Im picky with my ice cream but this is smooth and distinct in flavor. Paired it with a hot lavender tea instead of my usual coffee as this was a late night dessert run. Their waffle + coffee/ tea set is only at $10+
One of the best waffles I\'ve eaten 🙌🏻\n<br />The exterior of the cafe may look mundane and even nondescript, but the food inside is definitely a must try!! They serve a quirky assortment of waffle flavors and a wider range of ice cream flavors.
Located near chomp chomp, perfect for your waffles x icecream fix. The waffles was warm and sweet but not overbearing and it was complimented with cream cheese sandwiched between them. The icecream gave a nice contrast to the warm crispy waffles. Love their $10 set which consist of the waffles, icecream and a drink of choice! Yums! 😍
Ice cream is smooth and creamy but matcha flavour has abit of astringent aftertaste. Waffles are crispy, light and fluffy. Their red velvet waffle is a must try! 
Shld\'ve sticked t their waffles but got tempted when i saw \'seasalt caramel\'. Dont think there\'s a tint of seasalt taste at all. And the texture of the cake is just... weird. ): 
Eh heard and read about it so went to try. Aiyo! The waffles is burnt and really it isn\'t that great! Won\'t go back again. 
Personally I think that their waffles and coffee combo is very affordable and especially their red velvet waffles is so yummy! 
Red Velvet cream cheese waffle w Cookie &amp; Monsters drizzled in maple syrup. The cream cheese won me over! Waffle was crispy and portion is just right for me. However the ice cream tasted a little weird which affected the overall taste. 
Lovin the waffles here but a lil tad too much of cream cheese that it\'s too strong and cover the taste of the waffles and icecream! 
Waiting time of 30mins on a Sunday late night. The Waffle Combo for $10 with a single scoop &amp; cuppa latte was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.
The hidden waffles place in Maju Avenue serves up fanciful waffles like red velvet, charcoal waffles etc at $8.00 with a scoop ice cream of your choice. Its red velvet comes sandwhiched with cream cheese which goes well with the sweetness overdose. Definitely a worth to visit place which operates up to 2am during weekends
I could fall in love with red velvet waffles over and over again. Perfected crisp and taste. : ) They have another outlet in Balmoral Plaza which is nearer to town and I am excited to check it out soon!
Red velvet waffles sandwiched with cream cheese and topped with Horlicks icecream! 
Delicious! Only $11 for waffles, scoop of ice cream and an ice coffee which is considered extremely cheap for me since I come from AUS where waffles itself already cost about $15.
Waffles 👍\n<br />Service 👎\n<br />Ambience 👎\n<br />Waited 45mins cause they forgot to make my waffles 👎👎+👋(waves goodbye)
Late night dessert place for red velvet waffles! But waiting time can be really long.
The chocolate lava cake was well bake, but the taste isn\'t really there. Overall, it\'s decent (: 
Value for money combo - waffles, ice cream and a drink of your choice! I order an artisan latte, which was not bad!
Crispy and fluffy waffles with a fragran eggy batter with cream cheese in between to replicate Red Velvet Cake. Topped with a scoop of Earl Grey Lavender ice-cream which was aromatic and not too milky.
(:\n<br />#oblongicecream has good ice cream but they served me chaotar waffle. i like the way they present their waffles, similar to creamier. but their coffee not to my liking. #icecreamwaffleaddict
A perfect blend of peanut butter &amp; jelly that it tastes very much like the sandwich! 😋
Waffle and ice cream was perfect! However, this place needs to work on the air ventilation issue.
Even more when they are Red Velvet with cream cheese filling, topped with ice cream.
This is the place to have to die for red velvet waffles. Can never stop coming back for more! Price for a waffle and 2 scoops of ice cream is below $10.
Waffle made with red velvet batter, served with cream cheese and brownie&amp;vanilla ice-cream. $8.80
Too pretty, so it\'s another shot before I devour it! [Red Velvet with cream cheese &amp; Sea Salt Caramel Ice Cream drizzled with Butterscotch syrup (combo with a flat white) S$10 (top up S$0.60 for house special ice cream)]
The red velvet waffle was crispy but it was quite an overkill with cream cheese in between the two pieces of waffle plus two scoops of ice cream and butterscotch sauce. Didnt know the waffle was so small; I should\'ve just ordered one scoop of ice cream! But the two flavours that I had were pretty good - salted caramel and dark chocolate!
Finally made my way to Oblong for the highly raved Red Velvet Waffles!
On my WATCHLIST: Red Velvet Waffles with Cream Cheese and topped with ice cream (brownie vanilla flavour). Need to make a special trip down to Maju Avenue!
I feel that its kinda overrated. Red velvet waffles came with cream cheese and ice cream and a drink (i chose tea). Salted caramel was one of the yummiest ice creams. Would recommend friends to share. 
White Chocolate Blueberry and Spooky Dark Chocolate stacked on red velvet waffles sandwiched with cream cheese. Absolutely lovely!
Red velvet waffle with cream cheese! And 2 scoops of ice cream: vanilla w brownie ice cream and chocolate stout! \n<br />#oblongicecream \n<br />Best waffles ever!!
If you do not know, their waffles is da bomb! 👅💦
Paired the red velvet waffles with Baileys and Chocolate ice-cream - it was simply wonderful. The bitterness of the alcohol in the Baileys went especially well with the sweet cream cheese.
Which it was, \'cus it encouraged us to go find MORE dessert🙃🍰 The filling was super yum melty marshmallows and chocolate cream on point, but their cookie dough ice cream was meh. Their Root beer ice cream really tastes like root beer though👍🏼\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br /> #sgeats #eatsg #foodiesg #sgfoodies #burpple #singapore #eat #carbs #icecream #rootbeer #cookiedough #smores #waffles #chocolate #butterscotch #dessert #SG #oblongicecream #supper #chocolatewaffle #cookiedoughicecream #smoreswaffle #fats #yummy #serangoon #serangoongardens
Loved the Sea Salt Caramel, but the Rum &amp; Raisins tasted abit too medicinally alcoholic for my liking. And I don\'t remember the place being so noisy; not so ideal for conversations.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodblog #foodlover #foodstagram #instafood #sgfoodie #igsg #sgfoodblog #foodiegram #instadaily #igers #whati8today #icecream #TGIF #burpple #EATPL
We absolutely love this!
There\'s obviously nothing manifestly disastrous about that -- but the way Oblong departs from this banal combination with its Tiramisu waffles deserves a shout-out.
Here\'s my favourite scoop of jackfruit &amp; rum&amp;raisin (finally found someone who enjoy it as much as I do! ☺️❤️) ice cream! 😍😋\n<br />.\n<br />#throwbackphoto #picoftheday #photooftheday #instadaily #oblongicecream #dessert #waffles #love #latergram #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #burpple #nomsterofficial #sweettooth

$10 for the strawberry and cream waffle combo! Two crisp buttermilk waffles sandwiching strawberries and whipped cream, along with a scoop of Bananas over nutella ice-cream atop! Love the flavour and the aesthetic of the desserr! Beautifully plated on a wooden board, and drizzled with chocolate sauce and garnished with strawberries and granola too! Abit pricey, but the waffles were crisp and delicious, ice-cream was not bad, so I would say go ahead and treat yourself!
Best lava cake ever

The red velvet waffles comes with cream cheese, which makes it authentic to the cupcake. Waffles are fluffy and crispy at the same time.

They let you choose which type of waffles you want, (got Red Velvet!!) they let you choose your scoops of ice cream, they even have a set that comes with drinks. You tell me where else have in Serangoon (or at least North East of this country) what more, their price is affordable?? Is this photo Instagram worthy enough? You decide🌚

Red velvet waffles + coffee for ONLY $10! At some cafes, you can\'t even get a waffle for this price. The waffle and ice cream are pretty good too. Definitely worth coming back to try the other waffles. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #coffeefix #coffeeart

Crispy Red Velvet waffles topped with Earl Grey Ice Cream! Great place to hang out with friends after dinner for a quick dessert. This was $8 and it would be more worth it if you bought the set that comes with a drink at $10. Verdict: Would come back to try out the other waffles flavors.

Red velvet waffles with their famous lavender earl grey ice cream
1st try on red waffles and i have gotta say the waffles surprised me with the creamcheese in between. Ice cream was good not superb level.
A little too sweet and icecream tasted artificial

Lacking red velvet taste. 
Red velvet waffles, sea salt caramel ice cream, maple syrup @  Oblong
I went there during Christmas with my friends and they specially placed a candy cane in my ice cream 😌 Well-known among friends for their waffles, such as their charcoal and red vevlet waffles, the prices are affordable as well! Though so, be informed that the service can be slightly slower due to the lack of equipments (they only have one waffle making machine), which I feel can be improved. The quality of the food is good though! Try it out! It\'s located near ChompChomp at Seragoon Garden, Opposite MyVillage 😊
