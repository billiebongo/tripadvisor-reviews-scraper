🥚\n<br />•\n<br />Topped with Cinnamon powder for that extra oomph &amp; according to @justinfoodprints with some of my dining partners, it\'s life changing. 🤤\n<br />So move aside Bake Cheese Tart, Tai Cheong, Honolulu there\'s a dark horse joining the Egg Tart Craze. Plus now with PABLO CHEESE TART. 🧀\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: Baked only to order, the Smooth, Warm &amp; Creamy Egg Custard flows out after you sink your teeth between the Mille-Feuille (Buttery &amp; Damn that crust is Flaky) 🥐 Please Eat it while its Hot/Warm. .\n<br />Creative Director: @justinfoodprints
🤤\n<br />•\n<br />This is the type of Black Truffle Pizza you want, not the Bullsh*t stuff drenched in Truffle Oil which is, Fake Aromatic Chemicals created in a lab that mimics &amp; overpowers the true fragrance of Truffle. So FU*K you Truffle Oil. 🖕🏻\n<br />Real Truffle provides a pleasant Fragrance, a little pungent. One just have to keep it Simple, with good Produce, a little Passion &amp; a sprinkle of Love is all it takes. 🤤 •\n<br />ACAMASTIPS-GTK💮: The dough used by Chef Matteo for the Crust deserve a post by itself. 🇭🇺\n<br />Made from 100% Stone-Milled Flour.\n<br />Artisanal Biga (An all natural pre-ferment, biga coaxes out Richer, more Aromatic Flavour) 🍞\n<br />48 Hours of Fermentation is the time given to rise resulting in Lighter, Crisper &amp; Richer Aromatic Bakes. 🖖🏻
Atmastel\'s signature, and I love this. It\'s all crunchy, creamy, smoky, sweet and savory, all in this pizza. I especially like how the crispy San Daniele ham chips worked within all those mozzarella and broccoli cream, with fresh juicy asparagus being the star ingredient that tied everything together here.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Taken during a tasting.
🍠\n<br />•\n<br />The 150-year-old Homemade Sausage Recipe by Head Chef Andre Tarini\'s Grandma is something that I adore, made freshly in house. As a Cheese Slut, the combination of Mozzarella &amp; Gorgonzola works, the smellier the better. 🧀\n<br />Brilliantly sandwiched between the Cheese &amp; Sausage is the Crunchy Purple Potato top it off with the much needed Arugula that marries it all together, talk about a blissful interracial marriage. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMAS-GTK💮: Chef Matteo uses San Marzano Tomaroes (Campania) Which is long in shape &amp; is bittersweet in taste, these tomatoes are harvested by hand. They’re later crushed, canned &amp; used to make dishes like pizza &amp; pasta. 🍅
🥄\n<br />•\n<br />A Traditional Tiramisu served Deconstructed. Sponge Ladyfingers &amp; chunks of frozen Espresso  infused with Kahlua (Coffee Liquor) &amp; Rum which provided that extra kick. 🥃\n<br />Eat every component together for the Orgasmic Pleasure (One is still able to taste the distinct Flavours of each), that gets the Unanimous nod of approval from my fellow diners. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: As part of every aspect of life, preferably an experience with a Sweet &amp; Happy Ending (&amp; of course something Alcoholic) is always favourable. That\'s the route of dessert any respectable individual would take, therefore this will be a perfect option. Besides Cheese Obviously. 🖖🏻
Yes, it may be indelicate of me to say it, but asparagus has an unfortunate side effect on many... If that is your usual rationale for skipping this veggie, consider making an exception for an exceptional pie!  Perfect dough, rich cheese, prosciutto and plump asparagus spears combine for awesome flavors!
This basket of zucchini fries and calamari fritters calls to my inner fat kid, but the adult in me feels ever so slightly better in knowing there are at least some veggies involved... Nicely seasoned with light crispy batter... Good to the last bite!
Whoa!  I\'ve been in a funk for the last 4 years in withdrawal from pasta from chefs like Michael White in NYC... But finally, finally, incredible pasta has arrived in Singapore in the form of this gorgeous Garganelli... Hand made, cooked with fresh juicy sausage... Coated and filled in a sublime tomato based sauce... That\'s amore for my taste buds!!!
I would not have ordered this from the menu had I not been strongly encouraged by a friend... But as always, she didn\'t steer me wrong... Chef makes the juicy sausage in house and the dough is proofed for something like 2 days!  Combined with a slightly stinky cheese and the bitterness of the arugula, it was like a party for my palate!
🦐\n<br />•\n<br />A Seafood Pizza with a Fiery Kick. Just like that Girlfriend of yours. Looks Attractive, Smells absolutely wonderful, always makes you salivate. With an character of its own that stands out, both inside &amp; out. Once you had it, no matter how sinful, how wrong you know it is, you always go back for seconds. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMAS-GTK💮: [Part 2] Therefore the DOP label brings a higher price tag with it but it promises the highest quality possible. 🇭🇺\n<br />Italian specialties get DOP recognition only by following a very strict set of guidelines: Every step, from production to packaging, is regulated. 🖖🏻
Sauces here are made from scratch so that says a lot about the pride they take in making these pizzas as authentic as it can get. Ingredients here are all specially sourced/ imported from Italy. Think quality San Marzano tomatoes, chosen for its low-acidity so no additional sugar needs to be added for their tangy tomato-bases; genuine fresh burrata, mozzarellas and an interesting grano padano cheese aged for 24 months; San Daniele prosciutto, also cured for 24 months, manually sliced to make sure the heat doesn\'t affect the texture or taste. Made from 100% stone-milled flour, and 48h fermentation for the rising of dough into that light crisp crust - which was so good freshly out from the oven (ie. keep photo-taking to a minimal)!
An interesting combination we had for the night was Sausage &amp; Potatoes ($34) - not for the carb-watching diet. Pretty colours and the thinly-sliced potatoes gave an interesting crunch but didn\'t do much flavours-wise. Enter the rich mozzarella &amp; gorgonzola cheese that was pretty strong (reminded me of blue cheese 🤤); unsurprisingly the 100yo family traditional recipe of the head chef resulted in juicy homemade sausages which was delishly seasoned and SO GOOD.
Prosciutto and light broccoli cream (that kinda reminded us of pesto), crunchy asparagus. Loved the contrast in textures and the balance of sweet and savoury!
One of my personal favourite with that signature tangy San Marzano tomato base, clams, prawns, squids, garlic, parsley and a surprisingly spicy element from the chili flakes.
Ended the night with Black Truffle ($48) - believe me when I say this place goes for the purist vision. No truffle oil is used here, but real shaved truffles so one shouldn\'t expect the overpowering earthy, truffle taste we are all used to. Of course would prefer if more truffles were used but we just have to aim for the slice with the biggest truffle bits cos survival of the fittest 😂 Loved the giant slab of creamy buffalo mozzarella, atop the rich Grana Padano base!
🍕\n<br />•\n<br />This is where \"Quality really Beats Quantity\" \n<br />Using the Italian Best Tomatoes a Pizza Chef can get, picked by hand at their ripest, the tomatoes low-acidity &amp; mouth-watering flavour truly stands out. 🍅\n<br />Most ingredients are Denominazione D\'origine Protetta (DOP) certified (Will explain more in the next posts). Without a doubt one of the Best out there. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK (Good to Know)💮: Eat the pizza while it\'s popping hot, straight outta the oven. Trust me (at least just for once) it does make a world of a difference. Simple yet So good, packed with umami. 🖖🏻\n<br />🏵Enjoy a 1 for 1 Pizza Promo from Today till 31st May!

But since we didn\'t, I guess the Seafood Pizza ($38) came as a close second? Topped with a San Marzano tomato sauce, clams, squids, prawns, garlic, chili flakes &amp; parsley.

The classic pizza, but so perfectly executed that I\'m impressed with both the chef skills and the ingredients used.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The ingredients are sourced from Italy and rest of Europe - San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior de latte, grana padano, basil and extra virgin olive oil. Their dedication is also evident when you know that their sauces are housemade from scratch. When when taken warm, the tomatoes base were like lava, they slide off the pizza and glide all over in your mouth.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Taken during a tasting.
•\n<br />Super buttery flaky pastry encasing a creamy custard center that literally warms the soul. I really liked the crust to filling ratio; A thin crust and a super generous filling.🙆🙆\n<br />•\n<br />I loved how they are baked to order before being sprinkled with cinnamon. Perfect for a midday snack 😛😛
🍴\n<br />They pride themselves to use the freshest ingredients and you can really tell in their food. The pizza is chewy on the interior and crisp on the exterior, because of the 48 hours proofing time and 100% stone milled flour. They use San Marzano tomatoes for their tomato based items which gives the pizzas a very fresh tangy taste.\n<br />🍴\n<br />If you have no idea what to order, the Margheritta is your best bet, with stringy mozzarella to complement the tomato and topped with grana padano, a slow-ripen cheese (that is even more flavourful than parmigiano). You are definitely in for a treat. 🤤\n<br />🍴\n<br />The prosciutto sits prettily in the centre of the Prosciutto &amp; Asparagus pizza. It\'s almost like a flower that you can give to your mom. (Mother\'s Day celebration maybe?😂) The asparagus and broccoli cream cuts a bit of the sinful crispy ham chips they have on top. Definitely worked well together! 🍴\n<br />Another table favourite was the seafood pizza. The sauce was not just tangy and sweet but a little spicy as well. Almost like seafood marinara on top of a pizza!\n<br />🍴\n<br />The sausage &amp; potatoes was an interesting one. Purple potatoes and rocket vege may work asthetically but not the best combination. On the other hand, the handmade 100 year traditional sausage recipe definitely lived up to its name. This is Chef Andrea\'s family recipe! It was chunky and flavourful! 🍴\n<br />Black truffle pizza. Buffalo mozzarella topped with grana padano and truffle slices. Don\'t expect the overpowering truffle smell as they only use real truffles rather than truffle infused oils. So make sure to aim the slice with the biggest truffle! 🍴\n<br />From now till mid may, they are having a 1 for 1 promotions for all 5 pizzas! So why not grab a few friends and head down for a pizza party. Just take note that these pizzas are best (and must) be eaten warm! So do not spend too much time taking photos or talking. Eat it while it\'s hot and crisp! 🍴\n<br />Thank you Tiffany from @atmastelsg for hosting us and @burpple for the invite.\n<br />#burpple #pizza #atmastel #sgfood #italianfood
A combination that can\'t go wrong with ingredients sourced directly from Italy! Think San Marzano tomatoes, Mozarella Fior di latte and fresh basil. The handmade crust had a crisp texture, and was very easy to eat.\n<br />.\n<br />Atmastel is having a #LoveAtFirstCrust 1-for-1 promotion on all their pizzas from 2-31 May! .\n<br />This was a hosted tasting, and thanks @burpple for the invite! #burpple #burppletastemaker
Am I sick of them pies yet? Au contraire. If anything, it makes me want more of those floppy pizzas 🍕
Seafood Pizza speaks clearly about the flavours of the sea. Buttered with San Marzano tomato sauce, the homemade pizza dough is topped with clams, squids, prawns, garlic, chilli flakes and parsley. 
Pizzas aren\'t the only thing that\'s good at Atmastel. I was just as impressed by their vongole pasta.\n<br />The clams were plump and sweet, and the pasta was unerringly al dente. As saturated in the natural sweetness of the clam stock as the strands were, they still possessed that all-important firm bite (this matters a lot to me as I dislike soft pasta). When the thin shavings of bottarga (cured fish roe) softened from the heat of the freshly cooked dish, they layered on an extra umami dimension to the dish. I loved that.\n<br />Fun fact: The owner of this restaurant eats this very regularly. I guess you can say it\'s one of his favourites from the menu.
Even though I was going to have a big plate of pasta for my main course, I could not stop helping myself to serving after serving of this. Those silky sheets of San Daniele prosciutto were too seductively sweet and refined, while the fresh-from-the-oven focaccia with rosemary had a lovely crisp finish and cushiony-soft texture within. \n<br />As you may have guessed, post-lunch food coma was inevitable.
Using San Marzano tomatoes specially imported from Italy for the base sauce, the sweet and tangy flavors of the tomatoes tasted almost like pasta but on a pizza ($38)! Love those chilli flakes for the added heat amongst those clams, squid and prawns.
Not a fan of cheese? Atmastel still has you covered with its pure San Marzano tomato sauce and seafood (clams, squid, and prawn) option. The omission of cheese allowed the pie to hold up well, giving it added crispiness at the same time.
An unusual combination that surprisingly works well. Thick, crunchy, and naturally sweet spears of asparagus cushioned on a mozzarella bed topped with broccoli cream and grana panado, and studded with thin-crisp San Daniele prosciutto chips—like a crunchier, less-sweet version of bak kwa.
Liquidy custard centre egg tarts, would make for a nice treat to an end of a meal. Plating was great on a dark plate and sprinkled with cinnamon.
Mind blown. These piping hot and smooth egg interior encased in flaky freshly baked pastry dusted generously with house grated cinnamon.\n<br />🔸\n<br />These are premium egg tarts at a mass market price, so it\'s affordable for most. Available for takeaways too, and I did!
Ironically enough, Atmastel\'s most iconic dessert are their...wait for it...Portuguese egg tarts. While it doesn\'t look like much, it\'s a classic case of \'there\'s more for this than meets the eye\'. Priced much more reasonably than those overrated cheese tarts at $4.20 a pair (hue hue blaze it), biting into these little tarts is probably the closest one will ever come to experiencing heaven.
How good can an egg tart be? I never paid any heed to previous crazes from before, but Atmastel\'s version has definitely gotten my attention - The smell of the cinnamon that\'s dusted liberally over the tart hits your olfactory senses before the dessert even comes into view, and what a view it is! The lightest, most buttery and flaky pastry ensconces some serious liquid gold in its center. Few things are more satisfying then biting into it and watching the creamy custard - that\'s not too sweet by the way - dreamily ooze out of its molten core. Best eaten straight out of the oven.
Portuguese Egg Tarts ($4.20 for 2)
Black Truffle ($48)
Initially, I wondered why anyone would stick potatoes on a pizza, but after walloping this here sausage &amp; potato pizza, I ain\'t asking anymore questions. Mainly because I\'m stuffing myself full with this piquant pizza, but that\'s another story for another time.
Viene col mangiare, or \"appetite comes with eating\". Very apt for this gorgeous pizza which I did not expect to like to the degree I did. The strikingly coloured slices of purple potato par-cooked so that they still retained a slight crunch were definitely a point of interest, but what really got me coming back for more were the juicy handmade sausage chunks bursting with spice and porky goodness. With a base of mozarella and gorgonzola cheeses, this is one for lovers of strongly flavoured white pizzas.
Tried five pizzas here today, and this one took me by surprise as my favourite.
Sausage &amp; Potatoes ($34)
Seafood pizzas tend to be rather generic. Once you\'ve had one, you\'ve had \'em all. But this is not the case with Atmastel and their stellar seafood pizza, which I was surprisingly impressed by.
Atmastel\'s famous Zuppa di Pesce takes on pizza form with this tantalizing seafood pizza. Their San Marzano tomatoes gets a spicy edge with chilli flakes and a generous amount of fresh seafood like clams, squid and prawns.
Can\'t get enough of that mellifluous San Marzano tomato sauce and it perfectly complements the natural sweetness of the seafood without overpowering it, though I wish there\'d been just a smidge more prawns, clams and mussels. I always like a little heat on my meat-based pizzas and the amount of chilli used added just the right degree of kick.
Vying for top honors with the stellar sausage and purple potato pizza in the phenomenal pizza tasting we had is the creative prosciutto and asparagus pizza.
I could sing its praises all day long, but you\'ll have to try Atmastel\'s signature pizza to truly understand how good it is. A textural and taste sensation that\'s abundant with crunchy San Daniele ham chips, luscious broccoli cream and sweet asparagus, then crowned with a San Daniele prosciutto floret like the queen of pizzas it deserves to be.
Prosciutto &amp; Asparagus ($34)
Good food needs little more than quality ingredients treated with respect. Chef @matteofabian evidently adheres to this maxim because his margherita is one of the best I\'ve tried, and is as good if not better than the margherita at 400 Gradi in Melbourne.
Calamari &amp; Zucchini Fritters ($18)
H O S T E D\n<br />Simplicity is sexy.\n<br />Stripped down to an excellent crust (the result of a whole wheat flour dough and 48-hour proofing) and the choicest toppings airflown from Italy, this Black Truffle Pizza was befitting as the finale to our tasting session this afternoon.\n<br />With every bite I took, the combination of sliced Italian black truffle, creamy buffalo mozzarella, Grana Padano cheese and extra virgin olive oil was sealed in my mind as a glorious celebration of fine Italian ingredients. I couldn\'t ask for a better stage for them to appear on than the crust masterfully created by Pizza Head Chef @matteofabbian.
H O S T E D\n<br />Asking me to choose a favourite from the five different pizzas made by Pizza Head Chef @matteofabbian for us to try, is like asking a mother to pick her favourite child. It\'s simply not possible.\n<br />Each was fabulous in its own way, but they all shared a common trait: a dough made with whole wheat, stone-milled flour that\'s been proofed for 48 hours. This gave rise to an absolute dream of a crust that\'s light but chewy, and boasting a lovely crisp edge. Such quality means only the tastiest premium ingredients deserve to be laid upon it. \n<br />The one above is Atmastel\'s new \"Sausage &amp; Potatoes Pizza\". To be honest, it was nothing like what I\'d anticipated, but I mean that in a very good way.\n<br />The housemade sausage is from a 150-year-old recipe belonging to the Head Chef @andreatarini\'s grandmother. It came in the form of irregular balls of ground meat that were fresh-tasting and deliciously seasoned. To accompany it, Pizza Head Chef @matteofabbian chose to use subtly crunchy slices of the prettiest dried purple potatoes, fresh arugula, mozzarella and gorgonzola cheese, which I thought, brought brilliant results.\n<br />If your tastebuds lean towards stronger flavours, this would be a great pizza to try.
Sharing this because I honestly love the pizzas here.\n<br />Between now and 31st May 2017, when you sign up for their RED card membership (it\'s free!), you get to enjoy two pizzas for the price of one ON THE SPOT.\n<br />Just choose your fave two from the twelve options but only pay for the higher-priced pizza. Is that a sweet deal or what?! 😄\n<br />Me thinks it\'s a great reason to gather a couple of friends for a meal and catch-up session.
It seems hyperbolic to describe the \"Calamari &amp; Zucchini Fritters\" at Atmastel as fantastic but I honestly think it is. \n<br />There is absolutely nothing to fault about this dish. The small rings of calamari and julienned zucchini are thinly-coated in a crisp batter that\'s incredibly light and somehow, grease-free. For dips, I can\'t imagine anything more perfect for this nicely-salted heap of crunchiness than the housemade mayo and sweetish green apple jam. \n<br />Highly recommended as an appetiser for sharing.
I didn\'t expect Atmastel, a new Italian restaurant at South Beach, to have Portuguese tart on their menu, let alone one of this calibre.\n<br />Freshly baked, they are very light and flaky of crust, with a custard filling that\'s whipped to incredible fluffiness. What makes them so sublime in my books is the dusting of cinnamon all over. \n<br />These fragrant beauties are very affordable too at $4.20 (+ 7% GST) for a pair. I bought half a dozen back to the office to let the Burpple team try and the feedback was unanimously positive. Do call at least a day ahead if you wish to order more than 10 pieces.
H O S T E D\n<br />An innovative form of a traditional Italian dessert, Atmastel\'s deconstructed Tiramisu was quite a revelation.\n<br />Its dramatic appearance was mostly due to the chocolate soil and the craggy, monolithic chunks of flash-frozen espresso with kahlua and rum. The latter, with its unusually cold yet dry finish, was brilliant. And interestingly, it didn\'t seem to melt as quickly as ordinary ice cream. Plated together with them were the classic components of every self-respecting tiramisu: mascarpone cheese, coffee and sponge fingers. \n<br />If you plan to have dessert, I highly recommend giving this a go.
H O S T E D\n<br />Every region in Italy has its own version of the Zuppa Di Pesce - a fact Chef @andreatarini shared with @angelineongsuming and I. The one he serves at Atmastel is from Central Italy, where he grew up in, and we feel it is a masterpiece.\n<br />As Chef is strict about flavour and freshness, he uses only fish and seafood bought from the market that very morning (this does mean what\'s served may vary a little daily). Ours was a veritable bounty from the ocean with three kinds of fish - barramundi, red snapper and pomfret, as well as Tiger prawns, mussels and clams. These were cooked in a rich yet well-balanced, tomato-based sauce brimming with umami sweetness from seafood stock. \n<br />The portion at Atmastel is designed for two but it\'s so delicious, I can see myself having the whole dish alone, mopping up every bit of that bold sauce with their housemade garlic toast.
H O S T E D\n<br />When you listen to Atmastel\'s Executive Chef Andrea Tarini speak, his passion in serving authentic Italian dishes, or \"real food\" as he puts it, is palpable. Likewise when you taste the creations here, which are a culmination of time-honoured preparation methods and use of the choicest ingredients. What I found fascinating is most of the latter have been certified to be \"DOP\" (Denominazione d\'Origine Protetta), a mark indicating them having met the quality standards and traditions of Italy\'s different regions.\n<br />Take this San Daniele DOP ($36++), a signature by Atmastel\'s Head Chef of Pizza, Matteo Fabbian. Proofed for 48 hours in-house, the light and chewy crust is healthier and tastier than those using ordinary flour. Laid with care on it are the premium ingredients of artisanal 24-month cured San Daniele Prosciutto (this meat has a refined texture and is a lot less salty than others), Grana Padano cheese, sweet and juicy San Mazano date tomatoes, as well as fresh arugula. Both my dining partner Angeline and I had a fine time feasting on this fabulous pizza sans cutlery.
H O S T E D\n<br />Barely holding it together, the tight ball of burrata split open to reveal its snowy-white creaminess under a light touch of my knife.\n<br />Executive Chef Andrea who hails from Central Italy, believes in letting the natural flavours of ingredients to take centrestage. Which is why Atmastel uses mostly those of \"DOP (Denominazione d\'Origine Protetta) grade. And led by Chef\'s vision, they\'re showcased in ways that amplify their inherent deliciousness.  \n<br />Hence, the burrata was accompanied only by sweet, juicy mini San Marzano date tomatoes, fresh basil and a housemade pesto. Honestly, those were all it needed.\n<br />As bequiling as this appetiser was to the eye, I have to say it\'s positively ambrosial on the tastebuds. 
5 munchies: Simmered in a marinara sauce, the casserole of Neapolitan fish stew was loaded with barramundi, prawns, calamari, mussels, and clams. The umami-ness of the broth was absolutely smashing – packed with sweet-savoury goodness from the variety of seafood as well as white wine that imparted a fruity, mineral flavour!

Its spacious interiors, high ceilings, open kitchen and deli displays already impressed, but when we set eyes on this beauty, we knew Atmastel was not just another pretty face at South Beach.
Deconstructed desserts are gaining popularity in SG, and so excited to come across the modern interpretation by a talented pastry chef on classic tiramisu.
From Atmstatel, a new deli/restaurant situated at South Beach right beside Fynn\'s. Currently it serves a limited number of mains, pasta as well as sandwiches and pizza — there is a set lunch menu which includes soup/salad with a choice of main/sandwich/pizza/pasta and their homemade iced lemon tea; the price is subjected to whichever main course is chosen.
While the egg tarts aren\'t served piping hot in the way that BOCA does them (and hence lacks that initial excitement of the jiggly egg curd), the ones here (served only in twos btw) are pretty decent. Light, flaky pastry with the hint of cinnamon hitting strong on the very first bite, the insides reveal a sugary egg curd that is bound to be liked by sweet-tooths. Just don\'t expect it to be the local egg tart though, for that is what these are absolutely not.
too much carbs and cheese! ♡♡♡

Pizza dough filled with Italian nutella and almond flakes served with Madagascar vanilla ice cream. It was very unique and delicious.\n<br />*\n<br />Do note that this is quite large - it serves 4.

San Daniele ham is considered more superior and is fattier, sweeter and more aromatic than Parma ham.\n<br />*\n<br />It is amazing how a pizza with simple toppings of mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, San Daniele ham, rocket salad and shaved grana padano can taste sooo yummy 😋😋!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_atmastel #atmastel #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It is a straightforward pizza where you can truly taste the ingredients, which in this case were the amazingly sweet San Marzano tomatoes, the mozzarella fior di latte (made from cow\'s milk rather than buffalo milk) and the grana padano cheese (somewhat similar to parmigiano). The topping was so simple yet so delicious.\n<br />*\n<br />This is truly the best margherita I\'ve had so far. The dough was light, crisp and aromatic. It was made from 100% stone-milled flour and artisanal biga, a starter dough which added flavour and texture to the final dough.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_atmastel #atmastel #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
There are a few dishes which I think they do really really well.\n<br />*\n<br />Calamari &amp; Zucchini Fritters with green tomato jam and homemade mayonnaise.

Custard cream, chocolate soil and passionfruit granita with almond tuile. I love the taste of the passionfruit, both sweet and sour. The crunchy chocolate soil was a good contrast to the silky smooth cream.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_atmastel #atmastel #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Served with a topping of mozzarella and gorgonzola cheese, homemade sausage, purple potatoes and rocket salad.\n<br />*\n<br />The homemade sausage was soo yummy. It was a shame that I couldn\'t really taste the potatoes much and I found the Gorgonzola (Italian blue cheese) a little overpowering.

Having heard so much about the pizzas from @blueskiescottonclouds and @veronicaphua we couldn\'t wait to sample them ourselves.\n<br />*\n<br />Our favourite was the prosciutto &amp; asparagus pizza. It came with a delicious topping of fresh mozzarella, crunchy San Daniele ham chips, asparagus, broccoli cream and Grana Padano (a savoury hard cheese similar to Parmigiano). The San Daniele ham is generally considered more superior and is sweeter, fattier and more aromatic than Parma ham.\n<br />*\n<br />The dough was light, crisp and aromatic. It was made from 100% stone-milled flour and artisanal biga. Biga is a type of pre-fermentation used in Italian baking where small amounts of flour, water and yeast are used to make a starter dough. This initial fermentation when mixed with the pizza dough will add flavour and texture to the final dough.\n<br />*\n<br />I really loved how you could taste the natural ingredients of the pizza!\n<br />*\n<br />During the month of May, there is a 1-1 pizza offer if you sign up for the Atmastel red card.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_atmastel #atmastel #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

🔸🔸\n<br />Crisp hot crust that screams \"I just came out from the oven\". Every bite that smothered my palate with gooey cheese, salty prosciutto ham and sweet juicy date tomatoes. Not too rich but more of a tangy finish that somewhat felt refreshing.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />From now till 31st May, get a 1 for 1 pizza (of a lower price.. 12 flavors to choose from) when all you have to do is sign up for a complimentary Atmastel Red Card. Oops... just realized mirror image of my pizza. Lol! Pun intended!! Thank you @tiffanity_k for the invite and @atmastelsg for hosting us.
Petite golden wobbly spheres seemed to be dancing around my eyes. Whilst still nice and warm, Chef Terry did a gentle tap on the sieve and sweet smelling cinnamon powder lovingly embrace the tarts. ◾◾\n<br />Everyone has eaten a tart or two. Visualise, once cut open, you get a warm, smooth, soft, creamy custard embodied by a flaky crust. In the background, I could hear the gentle \"wahhhh\" coming from fellow foodies. Yeah... it sounds right and it says it all.
Hmm... we prolly dont see any stone mills locally. A stone mill is used for grinding wheat or other grains. Millstones comes in pairs. The base or bedstone is stationary. Above the bedstone is the turning runner stone which actually does the grinding. Very tedious process!\n<br />◾◾\n<br />This is Sausages and Potatoes pizza. The thin crispy crust is in itself quite tasty. In fact I dont mind eating it on its own. Garnished with mozarella and gorganzola cheese, homemade sausage and thinly sliced purple potatoes. This was a fine balance of saltyness from the sausages and cheeses, a subtle sweetness from the potatoes and finally the richness is toned down by the bitterness of rockets. My motto for eating pizza is \"less is more\". This fit the bill literally cos it was not overpowered by many ingredients as one might find in other pizzas. And the color is so purplish pretty.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />From 2 to 31 May, a 1 for 1 pizza is redeemable when you sign up for the complimentary Atmastel Red card. Purchase any pizzas and receive another pizza of a lower price and different flavor (12 flavors to choose from). Quite a steal as this one already costs $34.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Thank you @tiffanity_k for the invite and @atmastelsg for hosting us.

The good kind, if you know what I mean. Having had their sausages here before in the pastas (which was amazing) I knew how good they are. Just didn\'t know how they would go with potatoes. Turns out the purple potatoes are thinly sliced and with Gorgonzola cheese and rocket, this pizza was really delicious! Definitely something I would order again!

Chef @matteofabbian totally nailed it with his. For this Italian classic, he uses San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, Grana Padano, basil and extra virgin olive oil.

Really like the taste of this dish.
This is not your usual Italian dessert but the pastry Chef at @atmastelsg has truly mastered the art of whipping up excellent egg tarts. Light and flaky pastry holding in the creamy and eggy filling. Perfect with a nice Long Black. These were so good that I actually returned to get some for my friends the next day #portugeseeggtarts #atmastelsg #southbeachsg #desserts #fusion #sgig #sg #bscc_italiansg #burpple

Zuppa Di Pesce, this seafood stew is the best I have had. Market fresh seafood, which literally means you get what the Chef brought back from the market on the day itself. So in ours, we had black pomfret, red snapper, barramundi, clams, mussels, tiger prawns and squids. I have never had stew this flavourful before. A lot of seafood stews end up with lots of flavour in the soup or stew and bland seafood. So according to Chef Andrea, the secret is in using the freshest seafood and not frozen ones. Hence, you may get a different selection of fish in your order depending on what the fishermen had trawled in. The toasted bread that was served with the stew - we soaked them and mopped up every bit of the stew. So good. A definitely must order for my next meal here #zuppadipesce #atmastelsg #marketfresh #italiancuisine #fishermansstew #authenticitalianfood #realfood #madefromscratch #sgig #sg #signaturedish #bscc_italiansg #burpple

For the longest time, I hardly had Italian until @atmastelsg came along. So privileged to meet the team here today. Chef @andreatarini is extremely passionate about bringing the authentic flavours of Italy to Singapore. If you like the freshest produce and the real taste of Italy, you should make your way here. The burrata with mini San Marzano tomatoes is one of my fav starters. The burrata is creamy and the tomatoes are bursting with flavour.  Chef even goes through the trouble of making his own pesto to complement the dish #appetisers #sanmarzanotomatoes #burrata #southbeachsg #sgig #sg #bscc_italiansg #burpple

Just a thin crusted pizza topped with cheese and spicy salami.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />Freshly baked. The spicyness of the salami actually gave the pizza a hint of an \"asian\" twist but the italian flavors remains classic as in tomato based and cheesy which Chef Andrea aims to retain... authentic italian.
A fast and casual restaurant that is inspired by food cultures of the mediterranean. With an open kitchen, bar, bakery and crudo. Think the likes of homemade pastas, pizzas, sandwiches etc.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />When Gwen said there is passionfruit creme brulee. My eyes lit up and my palate perked up. Because I love creme brulee and passionfruit. 🔸🔸\n<br />The golden yellow glow. The smooth and silky custard. The crispy torched caramelised sugar that crackled. The zesty passionfruit granita. The crispy chocolate soil. All danced in a tangy tango on my palate. So addictively citrussy that almost put a tear in my eye.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Light, not sweet and a wonderful silken finish. Slurped this (of course in a ladylike manner) in a flash. So good!\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Thank you @atmastelsg for recalling your chef back from his break to prepare this for me. Very flattered and appreciative. Great hospitable service. Honored to have met Mr. Chan, the owner (pardon me if I got your name wrong) and Ms Gabby, the sister. Will be back for more.
