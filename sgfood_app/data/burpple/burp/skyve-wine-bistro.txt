I reckon this is one of the most satisfying dinners you could ever look forward to, because that\'s one helluva great beef patty sitting right there ‚Äì it\'s made up of 80% chuck and 20% brisket; Chef Jachin Tan\'s golden ratio, and bound purely by the infusion of Parmesan. Toss on some earthy porcini mushrooms, piquant red onion confit, a slab of indulgent foie gras butter, and you have the makings of a jawdropper. But if that\'s not enough to win you over, how about some homemade bacon jam? Slather that over the top half of the kaiser bioche bun to complete the burger, and enjoy its smoky salty-sweet flavour as you chomp down on this bad boy. Oh, and although Skyve\'s truffle fries are served in a \"garbage can\", they really are quite the indispensable sidekick.
A little Asian creation snuck its way onto the new dinner menu at Skyve ‚Äì pan-seared potstickers (literally translated from the Mandarin ÈîÖË¥¥) encasing some form of delicious creamy magic, in which I detected generous shreds of lump crab meat; I\'m also told there\'s BACON in it, which totally explains why this stuff is plain delicious. I\'m also a sucker for wasabi mayo, so this really hit the spot!
Had the privilege of trying the new dinner menu at Skyve, and practically every dish I had impressed me so much. But one stood out by an inch and that\'s the duck confit.
Vanilla gelato w caramelised apples and cranberries and macaroon shell. I like the macaroon shell but the gelato somehow didn\'t feel cold enough. Hmm
I\'m not sure what Kalbi is; if it\'s sticky and chewy slime that tastes like burnt BBQ remains, then yes I had it. I really like the saut√©ed broccoli which was slightly smoked and extremely crunchy, and the mash was really thick and creamy. But seriously, I didn\'t order broccoli and mash.
Bland, without a taste of truffle. Requested for more shaved Parmesan but that wasn\'t enough to improve the taste. I guess it tasted healthy and it was consumed fast cause we were all hungry.
Haha i don\'t rmb what this is but still I say good food must share. So gooood! Meat so tender! This place is definitely worth another another another visit!
Want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city but don\'t wanna travel to too ulu places? Then this is the place for you. Only a ten mins walk from novena mrt, this is the perfect cosy place to chill out as you slowly enjoy your food and wile the afternoon away. Effort placed into the food is evident when your ricotta hotcakes came with passion fruit butter and Japanese tangy seaweed mayonnaise served with an open face tuna (steak, not shredded or canned food) and avocado sandwich. 
The succulence and heavy muscle of the breed makes its meat extremely tender and juicy with a rich flavor. Available on the updated dinner menu at Skyve.
\"Naked\" egg yolk resting on a bed of seared angus beef tartare. The best part of this dish is you get to \"DIY\" and mix the condiments together. And did I mentioned truffle oil?
Meant for two to share, this comes with a coconut panna cotta, apple crumble, chocolate mousse (unexpectedly airy!), cheesecake and my favourite ‚Äì yuzu sorbet with dehydrated raspberries. 
This is one mega big-ass slab of pork, brined overnight so it\'s oh-so-succulent and tender throughout. Even after removing the bone and (eating) the generous layer of fat, there\'s plenty of actual meat to keep your stomach well-padded. And gawd, that crunchy, blistered pork skin crackling is üòçüòçüòç.
Previously served with a chilli aioli (which I adored), the much-loved beef tartare here has been switched up with Dijon mustard in an add-it-yourself serving concept. It\'s still good with the other condiments of truffle oil, gherkins, shallots and of course, that raw egg yolk, but I do miss that extra nudge of spice from the aioli in the previous version. 
How cute and quirky is this gathering of crunchy, caramelised green apples, crumble, vanilla bean ice cream and chewy jumbo-sized macaron shell? Red currants decorate this assembly and the macaron shell is  coloured orange, but both are subject to change according to the chef\'s whim. 
Probably my favourite fish next to salmon (I love oily fishies), chef Jachin Tan did this justice with a smearing of mildly spicy ancho chilli glaze that reminded me a little of black bean sauce, and a light lime cream beneath to zing the dish up. So addictive are the root vegetable chips ‚Äì sweet and perfectly crispy. 
The herb-crusted fillet of fish is well done, but what really captivates is the \"risotto\" cooked with homemade dashi stock ‚Äì it\'s not creamy like a traditional risotto yet not mushy like porridge, rather, a comfortable and immensely tasty cross between the two. 
Love, love, loooooooove this starter, which stars a whole momotaro tomato infused with basil reduction in a sous vide machine so it\'s not only soft and juicy, but also bursting with a mellow sweetness. Meanwhile, the nuttiness of the homemade pesto and crushed pistachios complement the subtle buffalo mozzarella just perfectly. 
Latest review on Skyve Wine Bistro is up at sethlui.com
I always order my poached eggs without hollandaise (occupational hazard), but my friend ordered the exact same thing and the hollandaise was seared! Would have ordered that if I had known... Haha nevertheless, I love the polenta. It\'s almost like cake with a crispy exterior, a nice change from English muffins.
Absolutely loveüíï the wild mushroom soup with truffle oil! That baked potato slices (top left in the picture) were a nice surprise with its crunchy edges. üëç oh, and they had 2 rockety chairs to add that playful note to the relaxed ambience in the restaurant.
It doesn\'t seem like many people know how good the food at Skyve really is (even I was surprised!). And the prices for lunch here are a lot less than what you\'d have to pay if you came in the evening. Our group of 7 were wreathed in smiles as we feasted happily on our a la carte dishes of Kurobuta pork cheek burger with truffle fries ($23), beef medallion with two onsen eggs ($30), truffle fettuccine with onsen egg ($22), scrambled eggs with portobello ($20) and the Skyver breakfast ($23). The grilled sea bass and duck confit (not pictured) were part of the set meal ($32 and $40 respectively) and were equally large in portion and well-cooked too. All prices are before taxes.
The fettuccine comes in a deep dish, drowning in a light creamy sauce that is infused with potent truffle scent. Mushrooms and an \"onsen\" egg peer out from the tangled pasta as though playing hide &amp; seek. This delicious vegetarian lunch item cost $22++ which I think is pretty decent because of the quality.
Of this lot, the Oreo cheesecake and the carrot cake were the least impressive. The one that got us unanimously excited was the sticky date pudding with vanilla ice-cream and warm Himalayan sea salt caramel sauce. The chocolate brownie served with ice-cream came in second, and the earl grey creme br√ªl√©e was a close third. While the cakes were part of the set lunch, the rest of the desserts were each priced at $9++. 
Dense and medium in moistness, this brownie is perfectly capable of keeping most chocoholics satisfied. And since no self-respecting brownie appears in public without vanilla ice-cream, Skyve Wine Bistro serves theirs with the requisite scoop, and toasted almond flakes ($9++).
Anyone who likes the flavour of truffle, will undoubtedly jump on this \"Truffle Scramble\" dish. I like how it turned out in terms of truffle-ness but found the texture a little odd. Pardon me but I tend to gravitate towards the creamy and silky when it comes to my scrambled eggs.
Two folded quadrants of delicate crepes come half-immersed in a sauce that\'s been flavoured with Grand Marnier liqueur. Perched on top is a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and orange segments. The portion is small-ish but for the price, I\'m not complaining because the quality is good.
Think big wobbly blobs of ultra-soft eggy deliciousness blanketed in a very tasty hollandaise sauce. The \"sou vide\" technique of cooking the eggs here takes it up several notches. 
Skyve\'s Gloria ($19) - in terms of ambience to quality of food this place win hands down. One of my favorite hangout venue. The price is slightly on the higher side but quality matches up to it. Combination of the English muffin, runny eggs, spiced tomato concasse and spinach went really well. Thumbs up!

Fluffy! Good for sharing!
Vegetarians will enjoy this - Polenta Mushroom Stack. Grilled portobello between polenta cakes spread with pesto. Sides of mushroom fricassee and grilled seasonal vegetables.
An absolutely gorgeous place for weekend brunch, or dinner and drinks with the girls, Skyve serves great food in a relaxed yet classy ambience. Think sous vide eggs benedict, truffle fries, duck confit, beef short ribs- in a large space with turquoise chairs and white tables.
somedays, you just have to create your own sunshine.. ambience ‚úÖ food üÜó // nothing compared to #antipodean
Such a bang on combination that we just couldn\'t get enough of! 
Super tender and moist chicken lovingly cooked in a warm water bath followed by some crisping up in the oven where they crank up the heat to get that lovely golden brown finish!
Although I prefer my oysters fresh with just a few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice (better yet, with finger lime pearls!), I really enjoy the one with the mentaiko. 
Mango and Cheese Semifreddo. Beautiful tower of frozen lime foam on dense, creamy vanilla bean and mango cheesecake and a crunchy sable cookie. #cheesecake #sable #mango #dessert #sweet #happyfood #yum #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Spicy Kalbi Beef Short Ribs. Sous vide beef short ribs with a sweet and spicy Korean-inspired marinade. Love how the meat fell off the bone with just a push of my fork. #beef #shortribs #meat #korean #kalbi #spicy #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
Skyve Beef Tartare. Superb on the accompanying flat bread, with ancho chilli aioli and that truffle egg yolk that gave just a hint of truffle flavour without overpowering the beef. Was a bit squeamish about trying this, but ended up loving it. #beef #tartare #meat #egg #foodporn #ilovemyjob #sgfood #burpple
Petuna and Ume Somen. Fresh, light salad of crispy-skinned trout with cold somen and mesclun in a sesame yuzu dressing. #fresh #salad #trout #mesclun #vegetables #noodles #somen #japanese #healthy #eatclean #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob #burpple
Tender seems to be the name of the game here. Their Sous Vide Lamb has to be the tastiest, most tender and juicy one I\'ve tried (least gamey too), as is the spicy-sweet Kalbi beef ribs. Their flatbread pizzas are also baked to order and come in a variety of delectable flavours. #foodcoma #foodoverload #burp
The squid ink is very tasty and the king prawns are very well done. I\'ll come again for their duck confit and the sous vide pork. 
crab ! Momotaro ! what\'s there not to like. crab pieces were pretty chunky and basil pesto &amp; yuzu sorbet added a zing to an otherwise simple dish.
sous vide egg reminiscent of Table66 days. comes in main portion ($34++) as well but the appetizer portion should be sufficient for small eaters
üç¥ Delish 3 course dinner: \n<br />1. Egg Cocotte\n<br />2. Fish of the Day: Seabass\n<br />3. Sticky Date Pudding
Ricotta Hot Cakes. The Passionfruit Butter Is Damn Yummy!! 
1-for-1 Burger this month by making your reservation via Chope App! We did ours and I must say it\'s such a great deal! Apparently there\'s only 2 kinds of burgers, beef burger or vegetarian so we choose beef burger! First of all, portion was toooooo huge to finish for 1 pax. I barely touched the bun.. Beef was AWESOME! Super good, soft and juicy. Chef cooked it just nice for Medium rare with some redness. Not many places knows how to cook the perfect medium rare standard... what\'s more, it comes with FREE Truffle Fries! wooohoooo! All the goodness in 1 plate!! Cost $34++ for 1 pax but now with the promo it\'s $34++ for 2 pax! Such a great deal! N for those who hadn\'t been there, you need to try their spam chips if you still have space in your tummy. Oysters was running promo on Tuesday nights too. $2.90++ for each.. BIG oysters with thick flesh.. n it taste so FRESH! Totally make our money worthwhile! One of the best romantic cafe for birthdays, monthiversary, anniversary or even a chill out place after a day of hectic work! It\'s has become one of ours Favs.. @skyvesg #skyve #skyvewinebistro #beefburger #trufflefries #oyster #freshoysters #1for1 #maypromotion
Www.jayellesays.wordpress.com]\n<br />Love the spice rub on this pork chop. Meat was tender and juicy.
