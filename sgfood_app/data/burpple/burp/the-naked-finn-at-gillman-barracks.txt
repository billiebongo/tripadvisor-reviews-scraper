Spear squid in its own ink and pops of the sea from the Gokko roe.  Fresh is best, truly.
Had the set menu for two ($188) which paired wonderfully with their house Muscadet, a crisp and delicious white wine. Each dish was fresh and prepared simply but in a way which brought out the seafood\'s original flavor. My highlights were the oysters which we added on ala carte (and I don\'t normally eat oysters), the grilled baby squid, the piquant vermicelli, the scallop and the Arctic surf clams in shallot oil. Head to Nekkid (their cocktail bar) for delicious cocktails after dinner! Yum yum yum!
Very sweet and tender. Naked Finn always has very top quality seafood and this is just another fine dish they serve. 
[Homemade Sour Plum Sorbet with Osmanthus Jelly S$10] + [Homemade Gula Melaka Sorbet with Sea Salt S$10]
And to add on to perfection, this hae mee tng from @nakedfinn has stock that\'s packed with a bold, complex crustacean flavor derived from the hours of simmering with Sakura ebi. Served with fresh wild caught prawns and Berkshire pork belly, this is pure indulgence.
Simple, unadulterated seafood. When the ingredients are fresh and full of flavor, you really don\'t need much to bring out the best of it. \n<br />#nakedfinn #burpple
Sorbet is so super smooth, there is no effort required to scoop or eat it unlike your hawker center ice kachang. The smell of GM hits your nose before you put it in your mouth. I like it that its sweetness is not overpowering the coconut-ey hints in GM. \n<br />#nakedfinn #burpple
If I came here and ate only condiments I\'d still be a happy camper because it\'s so good. \n<br />For the hae mee tng, there was iberico lard, spicy prawn oil, sweet chili and sea salt flakes. #nakedfinn #burpple
A little late for lunch but I was playing with my handstands. Heh. Here\'s some yummy lobster roll from The Naked Finn. Those buns are to die for. I just need a little salt. Post up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com!
That, ladies and gentlemen, is how long it takes to make just the broth for this Hae Mee (prawn noodles). The three types of prawns that go into it reads like the Who\'s Who of the crustacean world: Aristaeomorpha Foliacea (giant red shrimp), Pandalus Borealis (Northern prawn) and Sergia Lucens (dried sakura shrimp). They are fried in their entirety (yes, flesh included) in olive oil before being blended and simmered in a pork stock for seven hours. Sugar and MSG are barred from the proceedings by the way. So the umami-ness that hits you like a tonne of bricks when you sip the soup is pure, unadulterated prawn power. \n<br />I finished with my head in the bowl, licking it dry of every drop üòã #veronicaphuaeats #HaeMee #thenakedfinn #prawnnoodles #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgeats #foodporn #sgdining #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker

Hello lobster roll, you\'re still as damn good as I remembered! And I never imagined that cold kangkong can amount to anything worth mentioning but the blanched greens here are just zippy with calamansi juice and perfectly fried, non-bitter shallots. And the grilled baby squids are pretty tantalising with a heady, smoky aroma. *beams*
I\'ll be hard-pressed to choose between the chendol from Naked Finn, and Jin Jin Dessert\'s. But maybe this ones, for the coconut-studded sorbet. *beams*
Finally, lobster roll at The Naked Finn. Prices have gone up from $29 to $35. Guess we\'re paying for the reno and ac. Love them buns but more could be done with the seasoning. Meat was a bit rubbery. Still, not a bad way to get over tuesday.
Only served during lunch this is one hae bee hoon or mee you may not want to miss. Fresh tasty prawns with a big slice of pork done Japanese style and the star is the soup. Not a taste of MSG it\'s pure prawn soup. Pricy yes but worth it. 
and it was, in seventh heaven kind - wild caught deep sea mozambique lobster on cast iron griddle with only evoo. much smaller and less meaty than american lobster but the deep sea sweet notes were evident to the very last bit of the crustacean meat. salt by the side to compliment but i say, save it.
your regular kangkong blanched and tossed in kalamansi juice and shallot oil. served chilled as a cold starter @nakedfinn, each bite into the watery stems was a delight and so refreshing. love it that the salt (someone please enlighten me what salt is that) was by the side so you may enjoy the greens in full (morning) glory. pun so intended.
locally farmed barramundi fillet from @kuhlbarra was executed perfectly at @nakedfinn - skin pan fried to a lovely crisp and the flesh still moist and juicy. till this point in dining, am sold - naked finn\'s brand is about all about minimalism recipes with fresh premium seafood. cause good seafood taste great naturally, its natural flavor should take centre stage and not be masked by heavy sauces or seasoning.
wild-caught new zealand littleneck much like our typical blood cockles but meatier and smoother (i think). flamb√©ed in white wine, drizzled with fish sauce and fried shallot olive oil, i thought sauce and oil was tad too over and was disappointed that the briny taste of the uber fresh littleneck did not shine through. buy hey, am just being picky here.
cause fresh means natural flavors and needs no further dressing. wild caught baby indian squid with just sea salt and evoo on cast iron griddle. naise
Essentially ethereally wispy hotate sashimi with a touch of citric sass,  and all will be gone before you realise it. 4/5
Neither a ling nor a cod, but while the meatier external layers of fish taste slightly manlier and tougher than you‚Äôd expect cod to, the heart of the fillet is all soft and buttery cod-esque goodness. 3.8/5 
In spite of the glasses of Muscadet I had imbibed all through lunch, I zeroed in on the sole alcoholic dessert for my sweet ending üòè\n<br />The best way to describe this would be a sexy milkshake for adults because the ice-cream melted rather quickly in the Guinness Draught and Creme De Mure liqueur. So essentially, the contents of the tumbler became a lusciously thick, sweet and creamy mixture that could be sucked or scooped up. I stumbled across a couple of huge blackberries in there too, which was a pleasant surprise.\n
That\'s what this beautiful mess of baby squid grilled with olive oil tastes like. Inspired me to coin a new word even! üòÑ #umamiwhammy #TheNakedFinn #nakedfinn #seafood #squid #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgeats #foodporn #instafoodsg #sgdining #burpple
ATTENTION! ATTENTION! As of 1st April 2015, The Naked Finn has moved into a stunning new space, complete with a gorgeous vertical garden, at 39 Malan Road. Just in time too for my first ever taste of their famous lobster roll üòÑ\n<br />Having heard theirs is as good, if not better than the one at Pince &amp; Pints, I was naturally buzzing with curious excitement even before I got there.\n<br />Turns out they offer two types of lobster roll which are identical in every way except for one difference: whether the lobster meat is tossed (very lightly) in mayo or creme fraiche (a type of sour cream). Sooooo.... I ordered BOTH. Yeah, I figured there was no way I could decide which was better so it had to come down to that üòèüòÅ\n<br />Anyway, the promised 90 grammes of live American lobster in each roll (they looked the same to me when served) was heavy on the butter and exceedingly well-prepared. Regardless of mayo or creme fraiche, the level of sweetness and succulence of the lobster chunks was at the absolute max. If push comes to shove, I\'d say the former was a touch creamier and richer. But seriously, even if the dressings had tried, I doubt either could have overshadowed the natural flavours of the super-fresh crustacean. Credit must be given to the fabulous buttered and toasted buns as well - they added so much to every bite. I wasn\'t crazy about the accompanying fries but the salad was decent.\n<br />Now that I have inhaled the Connecticut-style lobster rolls here--pausing a nanosecond in between to grunt in happiness--my conclusion is I much prefer these to the cold lobster roll (priced at $48++) I had at Pince &amp; Pints. Yes, their version was nicely presented and enjoyable but because I have an affinity for warm sandwiches, I can\'t help but favour The Naked Finn\'s. \n<br />I live in hope that one day, they will decide to serve them for dinner too üòä
The Naked Finn didn\'t disappoint with this fish. With sea salt, olive oil and vinegar served together make the fish very good. By the way the restaurant has moved to a place diagonally opposite the old one. 
The Short Review
This is worth every calorie. No regrets. Buttery roll and fat juicy chunks of lobster (90g) at $29++. Shall start hunting for the best lobster roll now! 
Iberico pork with red wine sauce. Happy mid week! 
Oh do not belittle these two plates of plain looking Kang kong and cold vermicelli, they are their signature dishes. Pair them with belachan, sedap! I want more! 
I\'m never a fan of fish, cause I find picking bones out a hassle and disliked the slimy skin. But this was served with no bones, and the skin was fried till crisp and not too oily. Happy tum tum :)
Everything at naked finn was so goooood. Very simple food, nothing fanciful, but they were all so well prepared. Razor clams with fried shallot oil, simple yet full of fragrance. 
After kicking off with a fresh mesclun salad, the parade of gorgeous aquatic delights arrived one at a time. Mostly cooked with lightness over a grill, each item was unabashedly naked to allow its natural flavours to shine. The soup of flamb√©d New Zealand clams was lovely, while the slightly smoky-from-the-grill baby squid seduced us with umami-yumminess. We were wow-ed by the huge scallops, and then rendered speechless by the crisped-skin Barramundi fish. Small but rich, the lobster provided the sweet ending to our meal. Accompanying all of this throughout was a plate of cold piquant noodles, its plain looks belying its tastiness.
This cocktail is a winner in my books. The perfume of the honeydew melon blended with the unfiltered sake is simply sublime.
The unique way of using kang kong as a appetizer. Amazed by the taste, is actually delicious. 
part 6/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). perfectly done with a thin crisp skin, but meh... I am really not into cooked fish. 
part 7/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). dum dum dum... the grand finale doesn\'t disappoint. I\'m blown away by the natural sweetness of the meat. fresh and crunchy with a charcoal grilled smell/taste. and check out those eggs in the head.... slurp!
part 5/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). grilled in its own ink with sea salt and olive oil. \'coz unadorned and uncomplicated is the best way to eat squid. 
part 4/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). sweet and fresh. one can do no wrong with big fresh scallops, simply grilled.
local sauces and dips for those who are not quite ready to subscribe to the naked food philosophy. their sambal belachan has a real kick to it too!
part 2/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). bee hoon tossed with lime, shallots, spring onion. great with every course, a thoughtful addition for the carbo lovers. 
part 3/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). a bit subtle for my ruined tastebuds. 
part 1/7 of the 7course set for 2 pax ($168+). pretty tasty with a refreshing zing from the vinegar and citrus. 
Kalamansi + sour plum-infused syrup + SKYY vodka. all cocktails ($18-22+) are made from fruit sorbets to minimize the dilution effect when the ice melts. supposedly slows the melting as well.
$168, was $120 previously I heard. Set includes clams, scallops, vermicelli, salad, baby squids, small African lobster. &amp; pan fried barramundi. Fresh , refreshing seafood. Great but kinda pricey to pay for a place where it\'s infested with bugs. 
1. Grilled blanched kangkong tossed in kalamansi juice and shallot oil.               2. Very hot sambal..                                 3. Chilled piquant vermicelli
Very well done and not too sweet desert. The small bits of fruits on top add acidity to the desert. 
It\'s a good sized scallop which is well grilled. Very fresh and succulent. 
It really looks plain but don\'t be deceived by its look, it\'s really very tasty. The lime and savory taste is really very catchy.

FlambeÃÅed in white wine, drizzled with fish sauce and fried shallot olive oil. Simple as that but it tasted so amazingly good. The sauce and shallot oil gave a really good punch to the clams that tasted very fresh and sweet. Literally left us wanting for more.\n<br />Just loved how they bring out the original taste of the food and boost them with simple touches. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #clams
And you\'d be amazed with the taste of the dishes discovered here at The Naked Finn.\n<br />Take this signature Piquant rice vermicelli ‚Äúbee hoon‚Äù for example. Served chilled and topped with Sakura ebi, it was such a simple dish yet refreshing and enjoyable with the ebi. They obviously knew how to elevate the taste of the star in their dishes with interesting blend of east and west touches. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #beehoon
‚Ä¢\n<br />I wonder how the weekend ended this quickly.
Naked Finn\'s Lobster Rolls certainly are one to try, especially when its the warm lobster roll, one that can truly bring out the flavours of the lobster meat. One thing to note though, that it may be hard to get seats without reservation! #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #truffle #lobster #lobsterroll #burpple

Not only is this the most elegant looking chendol I\'ve ever seen but it\'s finely crafted in every way too.\n<br />The green squiggles of chendol are made in-house from scratch and because they do not use gelatin, the forming process is due to sub-zero freezing. This creates micro ice crystals which give them a very subtle crunch.\n<br />The pandan-flavoured chendol is joined by the gula melaka and light coconut ice-cream (also housemade) to create a sublime interpretation of this popular dessert.\n

Okay, these taste quite good. After tasting these, I decided on my next visit here just order these a-la-carte instead.
So far the dishes were okay at this point, no wow factor. After the vermicelli, my tummy started pleading for something that\'s hot. Maybe that\'s why I think the soup taste extremely tasty to me for the first 5 mins? \n<br />Add: The Naked Finn at 41 Malan Road,  Gillman Barracks, S109454.
