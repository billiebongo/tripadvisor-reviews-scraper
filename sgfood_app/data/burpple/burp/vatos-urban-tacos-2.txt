I\'ve seen so many people profess over and over their love for tacos (to the extent of marrying one?!), but I never did understood their innate love for it because I\'ve never tried Mexican food. But last Friday I finally had my first taste of it at Vatos, and probably because it\'s Korean-Mexican fusion food I fell absolutely head over heels with it!
Went on a tour around #SouthBeachAvenueSG the other day; covering 13 dining and beauty concepts. With an impressive 32,000 sq ft area,16 dining and lifestyle concepts as well as conveniently connected by Esplanade and City Hall MRT stations, South Beach Avenue is set to become the next hottest lifestyle destination in Singapore.\n<br />-\n<br />Nutella Nachos ($10) from Vatos Urban Tacos, a Korean-inspired Mexican restaurant voted by CNN as the ‘Hottest New Restaurant in Seoul”.\n<br />-\n<br />Crispy tortilla triangles coated with sugar-cinnamon mixture, loaded with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and liberally drizzled with Nutella sauce. So addictive yet so sinful, it’s definitely “nacho” average dessert. #punintended\n<br />-\n<br />#vatosurbantacossg #dessertnachos #komex #dessert #esplanade
I absolutely loved the idea of this dish -- the dessert version of nachos.
...And they managed to produce a winning taco again.\n<br />Golden batter encasing really moist &amp; fresh fish that remained crispy even as I ate this after the Short Ribs Taco. I\'m sure they really put thought into the flavours because they used a different slaw combination for the different protein. The tomatoes certainly added freshness and complemented the deep fried fish.
So this must be the KoMex fusion of the Carne Asada. Unlike the oilier versions I\'ve had in Mexican taquerias, this was \"lighter\", but by no means less flavourful.\n<br />I am one who usually puts hot sauce on everything, but this I enjoyed completely unadulterated. Perfectly grilled beef that had a subtle natural sweetness, with crunchy slaw and onions. It was clear that they used quality ingredients, and the meat really shone in this one.
The tacos are great, though abit small and. pricey (3 for $15). The tortillas are soft, warm and thin, and the ingredients are pretty generous and delicious. The combination is very tasty and reminds me of the good American tacquerias. However I felt the fusion Kimchi Carnitas fries are abit overrated. Kimchi and fries... Nah.
Almost forgot how good this stuff is 😋🍻 #burpple #foodporn #foodstamping #komex
Never get sick with tacos! Had a classic baja fish taco. Tasted alright. Fish is fresh. \n<br />But... I still love the pork belly taco though.
Holgate Norton Lager ($14++) on tap; the only non-American Beer from their craft beer list... It\'s from Australia! It\'s the lightest craft beer they have; easy to go down, slightly fragrant. I like it!
GF has been craving for Mexican food for while so we decided to go for Mexican Tacos at Vatos! We ordered 3 Amigos as starter which consists of Tortilla chips with Pics de gallo, Guacamole and Salsa ($12) for sharing. It\'s a little too much for both us, but it should be fitting for sharing with a group of 4. 
Featuring Galbi Short Rib \"Urban\" Tacos ($18 for 3). Tender and flavourful short ribs among crunchy slaw. 😁👍🏻 @vatossg ————————————————————————\n<br />Find out more\n<br />http://wp.me/p73MHP-hm or \n<br />http://peanutloti.wordpress.com\n<br />————————————————————————
Can\'t go wrong with soft homemade tacos packed to the brim, I particularly enjoyed the chimichurri chicken (14$ for 3) and slow braised spicy Barbacoa pork (14$ for 3)! Super reasonably priced comfort food 
This place is a stone\'s throw from my office, first time here, all abuzz on a Friday evening! Pretty decent food, hipster vibes 😎😎😎 My personal favs. were the Braised Carnitas (juicy, slow-braised pork shoulder) and Chimichurri Chicken (spicy chicken with sweet and tangy salsa, sour cream and Mexican cheese) tacos 😍😍😍 Order the Vatos Cowboy Queso (Tortilla chips with a mini hotstone pot of cheesy dip) when you\'re there.. that was a winner at our table too!!
Let\'s taco \'bout awesome tacos! 🌮🌮🌮
Picture this: A basket of regular, shoestring fries that hold a hidden centre of tender braised pork. Add to that a heaping pile of cabbage kimchi and generous amounts of melted cheese, sour cream, hot sauce and cilantro, and you\'ve got an irresistibly tasty beast — we mean, dish. These bold flavours in the Kimchi Carnitas Fries ($16) are not to be devoured alone — share the mess with a group of friends! And while your hands are already dirty, tuck into the Honey Tequila Chicken Wings ($16) — chicken skin fried to crispy perfection, laced with one part honey and one part jalapenos for that sweet, spicy kick. Also worth getting are the better-than-fish-and-chips Baja Fish Tacos ($10 for two tacos, $14 for three) — tempura beer-battered pollock fried to a shattering crisp, topped with spicy chipotle mayo, fresh salsa and apple coleslaw.\n<br />Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh
The name of this dish is enough to entice you to order. Amazing Mexican fried chicken. A must eat!!
First time eating at this place! Decided to check it out after burppling it. The fish were big in size and juicy, accompanied by lots of vegetables!! Highly recommend this dish 😋
The one thing I missed most about the USA is Mexican food.  The food at Vatos definitely filled the void.  I had the pork barbacoa tacos.  The tacos were bursting with moist and tender pulled pork ($11 for 2, $15 for 3).  Each taco had a generous amount of filling.  The three amigos dip with chips was good but pretty normal. Also the Honey Tequila Wings ($18) (not pictured), was very yummy.  We thought the mongoilita were rather pricey ($26) but when it arrived, we understood why.  It was huge! So do order the mongoilita and all beverages to share.  Definitely worth the visit. We\'ll be back for more! 
Everyone’s first encounter to a ‘Mexican’ dish was probably at the movies, snacking on nachos - crisp tortilla chips dipped into golden melted cheddar cheese. But nachos, as with other items such as fajitas, chili con carne and burritos, are not original Mexican food. Their birthplace was Texas, ironically one of the most racist states in the US… love the food but hate the people? Ok this isn’t a political history forum. Anyway Mexicans form the #1 immigrant population in the US, and one other top ten foreign-born demographic comes from right across the Pacific Ocean, you guessed it - Korea. With these two populations cohabiting in a melting pot of diversity and (milk) culture (=cheese, lots of), this interracial marriage shouldn’t come as a surprise… Ko-Mex (not the IT fair).\n<br />:\n<br />Vatos started in Itaewon in Seoul, and after a series of expansions across the city, opened their first international branch here in Singapore. So far, visitors have been happy with the fare, me included. The tacos were so loaded with meat that it was a bit messy to hold and bite into, but that’s a good “problem”. The Korean pork belly had been chopped into smaller chunks but still retained some chewiness from the fat, and quite flavourful from the gochujang and doenjang marinate. My friend’s barbacoa pork was pretty good too - the pork shoulder pulled to shreds after being braised then grilled. It had more punch from the hot sauce and cilantro, perhaps why it’s the more popular taco here.\n<br />:\n<br />We had a go at the makgeolita as well, at first thought to be a bit pricey at $25+, but it came in a huuuuuuge jug that was enough to share amongst the three of us. I like how the sharp ‘burn’ from tequila is toned down by the sweetness of the mild Korean rice wine. Perhaps they can try coming up with a frozen makgeolita slushie? Mmmmmh...
Much to our delight, the molten Cowboy Queso Dip turned out to be insanely good! That golden ooziness was made up of two kinds of cheese: pepperjack and cheddar, and swirled in it were black beans and a lovely lime-tinged sour cream. As a finishing touch, jalapeños plus chopped raw onions and tomatoes were added. A must-order for cheese-lovers.
All-beef patty, beer battered onion rings, cheddar cheese, garlic horseradish mayo, and maple bacon lathered in Vatos\'s housemade bourbon BBQ sauce. (Delivered by @Uber_SING #UberEATS; use \'eats-uberbryandmlee\' for $10 off your first order!)
Finally made a plan to dine here! Korean Mexican food. A place to Eat, Drink &amp; Chill.
The best thing to try new thing is to go for their classic before proceed for an adventure.
So the benchmark for tacos and quesadillas has been set and the Korean twist to the fillings used here at Vatos just takes Mexican food a step in the right direction. \n<br />My gooey cheesy kimchi pork quesadilla was a k-foodie cum cheese lover (aka me) dream come true? If I were to nit pick, the pork used could have been more generous and tender. But with that flavor and taste, it was easy to be oblivious to the latter. 
Does French Fries covered in braised pork carnitas, kimchi, melted cheese, sour cream, Vatos hot sauce, cilantro and onions sounds like your type of fries? \n<br />If so, you will like Vatos Urban Tacos. As the name suggests, @Vatossg specializes in tacos. It is a really spacious restaurant with dim lighting and a relaxing atmosphere, serving yummy Korean-Mexican food. They also do a very interestingly presented Vatos\' Rita, which is a Margarita + Beer served with an inverted bottled beer on a margarita glass. Free wifi is also available. \n<br />#freewifisg
Essentially happily seasoned fries cavorting with juicy, stringy pork at a most deliriously orgiastic party of creams and fragrances, whose individualities eventually cease to matter as they all blend together into a sweaty, Zoukout vortex of flavour. 4.1/5
Sticky, crispy, sweet, spicy. All things you\'d want when ordering fried chicken in a basket. The fried jalapeños were a nice touch and added a nice zing to each bite. \n<br />It was after eating this and commenting that this was better than any Korean fried chicken we\'ve had that it clicked and we realized Vatos is actually from Korea!
I\'ve been eating too much, but #notcomplaining 😆😋 delicious starters and interesting Ko-Mex food! #burpple #foodspotting #foodporn #foodstamping
Chilli lime prawn tacos and Galbi short ribs beef tacos.
Chimichurri Chicken - $10 for 2 / $14 for 3
A whole lot of craft beer on tap - from Modern Times &amp; Lost Coast breweries. 1-for-1 on selected craft beers from 12-7PM. I am a happy camper.
⚠ Warning: This will get MESSY! ⚠
One of the best rendition of Korean fried chicken I\'ve tasted in SG, coming unassumingly from a Korean-Mex tacos chain. The crispy wings were laced with sweetness from the honey but also spicy from the jalapeños. 
These tempura battered fish tacos paired with apple slaw were simply delicious and light. Love how the fish were so crispy, full of flavors and juicy, that I wouldn\'t have mind downing all 3 of the tacos! 💋
Sinful but yummy fries topped with kimchi, sour cream, pulled pork, melted cheese, hot sauce, cilantro and chopped onions. Every bite was bursting with a mix of flavours that came together very nicely, we just couldn\'t get enough it. 
An interesting and refreshing combination of strawberry margarita and strawberry &amp; apple cider. Great for sharing!
This slow braised sweet and spicy pork shoulder tacos is our ultimate favorite of the night! Served with cilantro, chopped onions and vatos hot sauce, be sure to get a mouthful of wholesomeness. The meat was tender, juicy and very well marinated. It packs a punch of strong flavors just like how I think Mexican food should be like. The cilantro would then nicely add a nice refreshing touch to it. So happy to have tried this!
Korean-Mexican food? I was doubtful but intrigued. We ordered a selection of their recommended items: Kimchi Carnitas Fries, Chili Lime Shrimp tacos, Barbacoa Pork tacos and Honey Tequila Chicken Wings. Drinks: Frozen Passionfruit Margarita and Dae Han Mango (Upside down beer bottle in a frozen margarita). Every single item we ordered was a hit. Approx $120 for 2 pax. Highly recommended. You won\'t regret it.
Come with a group of friends who love bold flavours, and start by nursing a Sexy Sanchez Vatos Rita\'s ($28), a strawberry margarita infused with a pint of Brunty\'s Strawberry Cider, placed precariously upside down on the side of the glass. For food, order the better-than-fish-and-chips Baja Fish Tacos ($10 for two tacos, $14 for three) — tempura beer battered pollock fried to a shattering crisp, topped with spicy chipotle mayo, fresh salsa and apple coleslaw. Don\'t miss the irresistible Kimchi Carnitas Fries ($16) — think tender braised pork and sauteed kimchi atop a bed of french fries, smothered by cheese, sour cream, hot sauce and cilantro.
It is so good on its own that you may not need the blue cheese dip that is provided to neutralize the strong flavour! The deep-fried and battered jalapeño can be eaten on its own without having to worry about its spiciness too!
Spicy chicken topped with a sweet and tangy chimichurri salsa, lettuce, sour cream &amp; Mexican cheese. This was one of our favourites that meal. The salsa was citrusy, sweet, with a lovely tang that lifted everything up! Word of caution: the chicken is mighty spicy.
Braised pork shoulder tacos with chopped onions, cilantro and Vatos hot sauce. Extra points for their floured tortillas; made extra thin but none of the contents will cause any tear and most importantly doesn\'t have the strong funky \"alkaline\" taste like most other taco houses. \n<br />Vatos carries a total of 9 taco variations (spoiling us with choices!), if you\'re here and having a hard time picking one, go for their Galbi Short Rib taco and Baja Fish tacos!
Loads of shredded braised pork and sautéed kimchi sitting on this mount of fries, finished with their signature Vatos hot sauce, soured cream and melted cheese. That\'s one mountainous mess I\'d love to conquer!\n<br />This kor-mex fusion joint\'s totally killing it! My kinda place to chat and catch up with friends!
These were the absolute snack when coupled with the alcohol here. Crispy fried chicken wings coated in a sticky and sweet, yet moderately spicy Honey Tequila sauce, garnished with deep-fried Jalapeño which adds on to the shiok factor with a light crispness. Comes with blue cheese dipping sauce on the side which somehow acts as a neutralizer if it ever gets too spicy; tasted like a mild sour cream though if you like me you probably don\'t need it.
If Tacos aren\'t exactly your thing, Vatos Urban Tacos also has Quesadilla, Burrito Bowls and Burgers (currently unavailable) to choose from. These Quesadilla comes with chunks of spicy chicken with Arbol Chili Sauce, Cilantro and Onions, which gave a little tinge of spiciness with a little tangy flavour to the quesadilla which came with melted cheese for the melty, stringy treat.
Marinated Short Rib, Ssamjong Aioli, Asian Slaw, Cilantro, Chopped Onion and Roasted Sesame Seed am not one who likes Tacos but this one certainly blew me away. The short ribs were so tender and succulent with just the right amount of slaw for a refreshing crunch. Tacos were one of the thinnest I ever had, which was not only just surprisingly light but a little chewy so it does not get too filling. Would definitely be back to give the other tacos a try; the fish one definitely sounded good from what I have heard across the board!
That\'s how good the fish in this little taco was. Vatos\' Baja Fish \"Urban\" Tacos was a delectable bite consisting of tempura beer-battered fish, topped with spicy chipotle mayo, pico de gallo and apple slaw. The thinly-battered fish was fried to a perfect crisp, keeping the flesh soft and moist without leaving behind an oily mouth-feel. Stellar in itself, it was complimented by the array of condiments. With components covering spice, tang, and a touch of creaminess, the toppings added tons of flavours while staying subtle and not overpowering the delish fish. Not the cheapest at S$10++ for two, but it\'s surely a must-try!
Kimchi Carnitas Fries: sounds simple and not all that mindblowing. But what we got was street food elevated by a complex layering of flavours. First, well-executed golden shoestring fries. Second, moist, flavourful and succulent carnitas. Then top that all off with spicy tangy kimchi, sour cream, pungent raw onions, hot sauce, and jalapeños. There\'s a bit of creamy, spicy, tangy, and crunchy all in a single dish! Absolutely fantastic.
Vatos, which originates from Seoul, is famous for their Mexican-Korean cuisine. It might sound crazy but the marriage of these two food cultures actually works. The specialty of Vatos is \"urban tacos\", of which they offer nine types (I hope I counted correctly) but you can also find quesadillas, chicken wings, burrito bowls, a few burgers and other tasty things in the menu. They also serve a Mexican brand of soda pop called Jarritos and of course, alcohol. Plenty of alcohol. \n<br />Between the three of us who were there today, we shared a quesadilla, a basket of honey tequila chicken wings and three types of tacos, one of which was the Baja Fish Tacos.\n<br />In terms of size and crunchiness, the tempura beer-battered fish was a hands-down winner. They were enveloped in the velvety-soft housemade tortilla and garnished with an assortment of toppings that included spicy chipotle mayo and apple cole slaw. Clearly, it was orchestrated so that every bite would deliver a punch of texture and flavour. In all honesty, I have not eaten fish tacos anywhere else that comes close.\n<br />Conclusion: If you like fish, this is a must-try. If you don\'t like fish, it\'s still a must-try. 😁
Sticky, sweet and spicy, these wings were insanely addictive. I wasn\'t planning on eating more than one as I wanted to focus on the tacos that this place is famous for. But damn it, resistance was futile. I was reaching for those remarkably crunchy chicken wings coated in finger-licking honey and tequila sauce like my life depended upon them. With or without the blue cheese dip, they were equally amazing. Oh and those masa-battered and fried jalapeños? Sheer genius I tell you. So simple yet what a party on the palate they spark.\n
The fabulousness begins with the housemade tortillas which are pancake-like in thinness and very soft to the bite. Clasped in each are tender pieces of pork belly that have been marinated in a Korean chilli paste. Adding a burst of refreshing crunch are sliced onions and pickled red onions, while a squiggle of ssamjang aioli smoothens things out. Altogether, they make every bite freaking sublime.
If there ever was pork that deserves to be called sexy, this would be in the running for sure. Having simmered for goodness-knows-how-long in a sweet and spicy sauce till quite dry, the pork shoulder that was shredded up for serving, was really tender and deeply flavourful. It came perfectly dressed with cilantro, chopped onions and a streak of hot sauce on a Vatos\' signature soft, thin tortilla. What I really liked about this was how the spiciness of this taco seemed to lie low at first before lunging forward a split second later, almost as if shouting \"Boo!\" at your tastebuds. 
This was the dish I liked least. Nothing was wrong with it per se. It\'s just that because I am used to a softer, cheesier version of quesadillas, the lightly crispy finish of this one came across as rather dry to me. 
that kimchi pork taco hit all the right spot while the wings are superbly marinated. the pulled pork fries or whatever they call you it, topped off with lots of onions and salsa was wiped clean
So you’re craving Mexican but tired of generic tacos? Fret not, because tucked away in an old colonial facade along Beach Road is a little hideout offering a tangy and spicy Korean twist to the Mexican staple.\n<br />.\n<br />We had the Chilli Lime Prawn ($17) and Braised Carnitas ($14) tacos, both topped with tomatoes and onion, drizzled with light mayo. Their Kimchi Carnitas Fries ($16) - fries topped with shredded pork, kimchi and a little melted cheese was pretty memorable, with the spice and zest from the kimchi balancing out the gelak-ness of the fries. Pork shreds were tender with the meat fibres falling off easily. .\n<br />Great for a Mexican fix if you’re in the area, muchas gracias! ;)\n<br />_______________\n<br />Vatos Urban Tacos\n<br />South Beach\n<br />36 Beach Road\n<br />#01-03\n<br />Singapore 189766\n<br />.\n<br />#eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #exploreflavours #dojoeats#mexicanfood
These wings are served with deep-fried masa-battered jalapeños, cilantro &amp; blue cheese dipping sauce.\n<br />The combination of the juicy and well-marinated wings and the dip definitely drew us in and I guess we will be going back for more! 🙊 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.

Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Who would have thought that the tangy Mexican flavours would blend so well with the spicy sour Korean kimchi? Best fusion fries ever 😆 made even better with chunks of shredded pork hidden under that sauce

Seriously some good stuff. Thank you Jialiang for the recommendation
Enjoy the fusion it offers. Yummy tapas

They\'ve certainly got some pretty interesting presentation going on here! Drinks were pretty yummy too!
Braised Carnitas - $10 for 2/$14 for 3
The smoky and sweet taste of the meat accompany well with the Asian slaw and the soft taco skin!
Not sure how the name of the drink is in anyway related to whats in it but this is a cloyingly sweet cocktail that will be enticing to those with a sweet tooth. \n<br />The way they present the cocktail makes it instragram worthy as well
Kimchi and cheese seem to be really compatible buddies and the chewy braised pork by itself is already a huge appeal.
