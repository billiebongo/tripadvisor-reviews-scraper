Meat is tender and juicy, and when you add on sides and drinks, they deduct $1.90 off your bill. 
Not bad, the patty is juicy, the ingredients is fresh and the cheese on the burger melts just nice.
Very delicious. The meat patty is juicy and cook to perfection. 
So good that u can eat it on its own. Definitely a must try. 
Tender pork shoulder braised in a rich red wine and tomato stock, paired with black miso, arugula and Japanese cucumbers for a sweet, savoury and complex flavour.
Haven\'t had such juicy burgers in a while! And their onion rings are the real ones! 😂😂😂 Super satisfying but super guilty too! 😁😁😁
Well seasoned patty cooked to a perfect, juicy medium rare, sandwiched between pillow soft corn buns. Served here with truffle fries. The food here is good, unfortunately the experience is marred by everything being quite oily. Does not really justify the price imo.
Light and fluffy, but at the same time quite unpleasantly oily.
This meal costs me $24.40 (deluxe cheeseburger + cheese fries + homemade lemonade) but the deluxe cheeseburger which came with a juicy, light pink and medium beef patty was really good!
Known for their good burgers, this place is a must visit for burger lovers. Their Omakase Cheeseburger is prepared with their very own Omakase sauce, which brings out the burger well. 
Burger is average, very unhealthy and fattening. Sweet potato fries is still fries, hence probably isnt the best meal for a healthy diet. Burger is S$13.90, sweet potato fried is S$5.90
Truffle fries &amp; Omakase cheeseburger:  - JUICIEST MEDIUM BEEF PATTY. I swear the juice was dripping all over hahahahahaha damn shiok! And the truffle fries is not bad^^ #burpple
My Verdict: Not fantastic and definitely not worth the cash nor calories.
Foie Gras Burger from Omakase Burger at Turf City. This month\'s special, but find those on their regular menu way better. Nonetheless, still feel that this burger joint is a hidden gem! I\'d come back again, and again and again...! #omakaseburger #foiegras #burrple
Hand-ground beef patty, toasted artisanal bun, melted American cheese, lettuce, tomato and secret Omakase sauce; topped with high quality American bacon smoked in natural hardwood, as well as a generous helping of grilled onions and mushrooms.
from $15.90..patty is juicy enough but kinda tiny so it\'s not chunky the way I like my patties to be. no sauce although supposed to have some special omakase sauce. bun is unique in that its slightly sweet, but would be better toasted or grilled cos it tends to get soggy towards in the end. truffle fries were good though, generously drizzled w truffle oil and some random bits of black (prob china) truffles.
Let the chef decide... We\'re finally here to see what the hype is all about! 🍔🍟
Juicy (almost to the point of watery) burger with a pretty well cooked patty. But terribly oily fries with hardly any truffle taste tho. 
had the deluxe burger topped with grilled onions and sautéed mushrooms. not the best I\'ve had but definitely worth a try
The much hyped about omakase burger! Hand ground beef party, toasted artisanal bun, melted American cheese, lettuce, tomato and \"secret Omakase sauce\". Loved it but this is tiny for the hefty price tag of $13.90
Finally trying the cheeseburger here, while it had shades of shake shack\'s awesomeness I find the prices here a bit too high - 22$ for what u see here OMG. Am I living in SG?? And why no sweet potato fries?!?!
The bun was soft and the beef patty was ok but don\'t seem to worth the price 
Over priced even though its nice.
I wonder why they called in a sandwich instead of burger 😑 chicken was quite tough
Omasake beef burger, medium-rare is the bomb. The only place i\'d visit for beef burger now. Oishii!!
I can never get sick of this. Chowing this on a Monday night before my IPPT tomorrow.
i like this :&gt;
i think i\'m more intrigued by the glass; but it\'s really fresh
paid about $15 for this, but the beef patty is rather juicy
Still the best cheeseburger in town! Come to Papa! #sgfood #powerlunch
Best burgers yet!
the price to pay for shakeshack in sg, hoboy. nice place, but overpriced burgers given its fastfood concept?
Yum yum yum! Beef patty was super juicy and the bread was very soft. Not gna rave about the sides but def a good burger!
All sorts of fried veggies. Can call it tempura? Haha!! Normal, Truffle, Cheese and Sweet Potato.
Deluxe Cheeseburger. The beef burgers here are superb. Very delicious! (the chicken errr, very oily)
The fluffiest buns sopping up the juices from the smashed burger patty. I think the bun to patty ratio is spot on! Pricey? Maybe. But so so worth ittttttt!
🍔😛

Other members of my family, however, prefer the more flavourful bacon cheeseburger with American bacon smoked in natural hardwood or the \'umami bomb\' (as described in the menu) deluxe cheeseburger with a generous helping of grilled onions and mushrooms.\n<br />*\n<br />Can\'t have burger without fries. I prefer the truffle fries with a white &amp; black truffle blend and grated Italian black summer truffles. Again some members of the family prefer the cheese fries with a very generous helping of gooey cheese on top.\n<br />*\n<br />Lastly the orange juice may be expensive but it is freshly squeezed with no added sugar.\n<br />*\n<br />Always satisfied after a meal at Omakase Burger! 😋\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_omakaseburger #omakaseburger #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It is like margherita for pizzas.\n<br />*\n<br />This is so true of the basic omakase cheeseburger at the Turf City outlet. It was simply delicious. Every part of the burger was tasteworthy on its own. The handground beef patty was made of a propriety blend of 100% USDA choice-grade premium cuts, the toasted artisanal bun soft and fluffy while the melted American cheese soo tasty. When combined with lettuce, tomatoes and the all so important secret omakase sauce, each bite of the burger was a perfect blend of flavours in your mouth. So so yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />Do note that the quality of its burgers at the Wisma Atria outlet has not been very consistent, so do make a trip to the Turf City outlet if you wish to enjoy this umami burger.\n<br />*\n<br />To my friends who are wondering why I tagged them in this post, I am supporting Burpple\'s burger challenge.

Great company. #tingzieeats #burpple @leenzsim @tangsher
Wish these was a bit more blue cheese. Who am I kidding.. A lot more blue cheese would made this super. #burpple #burger #foodporn #foodaffair #birthdaymonth
I\'d recommend to travel to the grandstand for the Omakase burger instead of the one at Wisma 🙈 it really tasted so good😍
Juicy and satisfying
Really great truffle fries &amp; decent sweet potato fries 🍔🇯🇵 but prices are way up north! Don\'t think I\'ll go back unless they have a good promo / introduce rice burgers 😶 &amp; Now I\'m still regretting not buying those macarons from Pasarbella, but I\'m still financially unstable 😭💸\n<br />#lifeisdelicious #omakaseburger #burpple #openricesg #pickatsg #eatoutsg

In other news, I\'m gonna have my annual McDonald\'s meal in 2 days time! It\'s been a year since! 😛
there are occasions when onion rings are evidently bigger than your burger. this is one. huge huge onion rings but tasted bland and a tad oily to my liking though
Deluxe Burger #yum #burp
Highly recommended by many and I started to see why. Even though it was a tad to the pricey side, it was still nevertheless yummy. But now the question is, are you willing to pay that much for a burger? #wueat #sgeat #sgfood #instafood #instaeat #8dayseat #burger #omakase #cheese #fries #foodie #sgfoodie #food #burpple

Deluxe cheeseburger &amp; truffle fries 🍔🍟 freaking delicious, one of the best burgers I\'ve had 😍
Kinda deep fried. Good mixed of cheese on chicken. 
Taste just nice; not too sweet, not too sour. 
@findray was telling us how crowded this burger place always is during lunch hour. So we thought okay let\'s give it a try, since we are here and there\'s no crowd at all. Guess whatz? Wheeeee! This is one of the best #cheeseburger I have eaten. Sooo yummmeh one. You can choose how well you want your beef patty to be cooked. Of course, their sweet potato fries &amp; truffle fries is so so good tooz. And of course of course, the best is the pickles is take-as-much-as-you-want, I like man (Keep on emphasizing only). HAHAH!! #omakaseburger #omakase #foodie #foodporn #fatfood #igsg
