Back for the extremely affordable wagyu beef rump cap steak ($13) and I was still impressed with its smokiness, flavour and marbling (the bits of crispy juicy fat that burst in the mouth were so sinful but delightful)!!!!
Not impressed with the wagyu (way too tough for my pampered taste buds) but a very generous portion of foie gras. Still prefer Tanuki raw for budget beef Donburi (even though not wagyu) and Fat Cow for the splurge version. 
Small in looks, but fills you up. Wagyu rump was tender and went well with the generous portion of truffle sauce. Fulfilled.
Wagyu Don with Foie Gras ($18 nett) - Comparing this to the original, there were not even half the number of beef slices-- only 5. But the Foie Gras was a solid good size; creamy &amp; tastes great. You decide if forking out the extra $ is worth it.
Wagyu Don ($13 nett) - Everyone raves about it. The nice uncle manning the stall was friendly &amp; explained to me what\'s on the menu.
One of the best pork cheeks tagged at such affordable price of $12. We wowed when we saw we got extra 1/3 layer of pork cheeks! 😙😙 Maybe we looked very hungry. 
Bedok Marketplace is quite out of the way for us but the food served up by Chef Jeremy Han at The Burning Oak was so worth the trip and the heat from that blazing sun.
They are having a foie gras and wagyu don for this month but it\'s probably too atas (read: too oily) for me. &amp; so the combo- the iberico pork really does melt in the mouth, no kidding, and the wagyu was nicely seasoned. There is a fatty layer on the pork and some tendons in the wagyu though, maybe I just didn\'t know how to appreciate it? Uncle was very enthusiastic, so I feel proud supporting him. haha! and $15 for this, that means I don\'t feel so guilty eating it xD
Finally I Am here for their beef Short Ribs Skewers,tender juicy just little pricey but definitely worth a try :)
Had their signature dish The Combo ($15). The pork cheek was fatty but it was so flavourful and rich, I usually will remove visible fats from my meats but this was too good! In comparison the wagyu beef might not look outstanding but for the price paid it is definitely decent quality. There\'s is also a hidden onsen egg under the meats, mixed with rice and pair it with the meats 😍 thumbs up.
The beef was really tender and the pork had just enough fats to melt in your mouth! Served with an onsen egg at the bottom of the bowl with their perfectly concocted sauce, it was a very good match! 😋
Ordered the iberico pork and wagyu beef combo don at $15.00 !!!is pretty worth it 😍the beef is fresh and tender and really give it a like for their iberico pork ,fatty !fresh! Juicy ! and maybe any other  more good words to describe ,plus a onsen egg ,is definitely value for money !but the rice and the sauce could be improve as a bit too sweet and will get jelat easily .i am fail to try their super famous 72 hours sous vide beef short ribs skewers (selling @ $6.00/each )as it is sold out when I am arrived at 8 pm😫 Cant wait to grab their short ribs skewers .
The Combo ($15) - value-for-money don with onsen egg hidden beneath the very flavourful wagyu rump cap (that could be slightly more tender but good enough for its price!). My heart was with the iberico pork cheek though, with melt-in-the-mouth fatty goodness! 
Runny egg done to perfection, beef oozing with flavor and the pork soft, tender and tasty. Sauce is also light. And to top it off it\'s super value for money. Loved every bit of it!! 
Ordered the wagyu beef rump cap + iberico pork cheek don ($15) - smoky, charred and nicely marbled with the right amount of fat and a hidden onsen egg (wagyu wasn\'t very tender but for that price one shouldn\'t complain)! I\'m a huge fan of the 72-hour sous vide beef short rib skewers ($6 each) that were tender, juicy and simply bursting with flavour.
This was SO good!! The Iberico pork was so fatty and melted in my mouth. Really worth it for the quality, I think it\'s almost impossible to find iberico pork AND wagyu beef in a rice bowl for $16 anywhere else so this place is really a gem! 
This was SO good!! The Iberico pork was so fatty and melted in my mouth. Really worth it for the quality, I think it\'s almost impossible to find iberico pork AND wagyu beef in a rice bowl for $16 anywhere else so this place is really a gem! 
$15 for both pork cheeks &amp; wagyu beef slices don. Pricey but it was really delicious! Will be coming back for more pork (I liked that more)
Simpang Bedok is commonly known as a supper place where tons of prata houses including the famous Spize is located. Now you can add Burning Oak into the Simpang Bedok food list. Located at the former old hawker centre behind Spize which is now revamped with many other concept stalls, the Burning Oak serves bloody good cow meat! The gyudon and Porkcheek combo is a must try! The wagyu beef is tender beyond belief and the pork cheeks needless to say, taste even more tender than butt cheeks ;) Owner claims that the beef is slow-cooked in a vacuum container for 24hrs to bring out the tenderness of the beef..Unbelievable..be there early cuz they sell out fast! 超好吃的牛排豬肉飯！慢熬的牛肉以及鬆軟的豬肉嫩到融化在嘴裡！甜味爆慘了！大量推薦大家去品嚐！
Combo bento of Wagyu Rump Cap, marbling score 4/5 and 10 hours slow cooked Iberico Pork Cheeks. With onsen egg hidden underneath the rice and meat. The wagyu rump cap is still juicy and the pork cheek is sinfully good, a bit too fatty for me though. It\'s $15, quite a steal! 
First time here so tried the combo of wagyu beef rump cap and Iberico pork cheek don. So good! Melt in the mouth fatty pork cheek slices and flavourful beef slices. My only critic was the rice which was a bit plain and boring. A steal at $15. Also recommend getting the chicken thigh sticks which were tender with a nice char grilled fragrance!
Each executed perfectly, grilled over binchotan charcoal!
Starting today (05-Jan-2016), The Burning Oak will be rolling out a new, expanded menu! But they\'ve also kept old favourites, and will be making bento sets available at dinner!
Introducing Pork Shoulder, Pork Cheeks, Chicken Meatball. Nothing expected less of Burning Oak, yummy in the tummy. Will definitely come here a third time just to try out the short ribs!\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
One of the set lunches for the day which also comes with pickled vegetables and soup. Done medium-rare, the Wagyu beef is done pretty well here, achieving a pinkish centre. Flame-grilled, the exterior  carried a good amount of smokiness, while insides were tender and juicy. Rice comes with a sauce which was similar to very subtle, light and savoury Japanese mayo. While there is really nothing much to complain for its price tag of $13.90, it would have been really perfect if certain bits were less veiny.
Out of all the extremely delicious skewers out there in this place, I find this (Wagyu Beef Rump Cap MBS5) the tastiest. For $13, the quality of the beef was just simply too good! The tenderness of the meat was just right, not to mention it was so flavorful!! Didn\'t manage to give Short Ribs a try because it was sold out already. The other two dishes, including pork shoulder and pork cheeks are also worth ordering! \n<br />Worth it to give this place a try? Definitely! 😌\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography \n<br />P.S : 5 weeks to Japan!!! Can\'t wait!! 😁😁😁
$15 worth of mouth watering meat that comes with a surprise center watery egg. 
Slices of marbled wagyu rump with a robust beef flavour, and Iberico pork cheeks, delicately tender with melt-in-mouth fats. Both had a subtle, yet wonderfully charred fragrance that worked well. Plated on a bed of Japanese rice, and garnished with sesame seeds, chopped spring onions and thin silvers of fried ginger. Served alongside Tsukemono like pickled daikon and marinated ginger to cut the richness, with a bowl Miso soup. All that quality, variety, and presentation for $15 in a hawker centre? Unbelievable! Pity this is only available for lunch..\n<br />#theburningoaksg #thebedokmarketplace  #burpple
Housed in the newly revamped Bedok Marketplace is the super hip Japanese yakitori stall, The Burning Oak. Apart from their delicious 72-hour slow-cooked Angus Beef Short Ribs Skewers ($6), they also dish out donburis for a limited time for lunch each day (noon to 1:30pm, Tue to Sun). Not your typical hawker food, these lunch donburi options include the affordably indulgent Wagyu Beef Rump Cap Don ($13) with irresistibly charred slices of Wagyu and the Iberico Pork Cheek Don ($12), made complete with a hidden onsen egg. Wagyu beef in a hawker centre? You got that right.
One of the cheapest wagyu beef around! The portion of meat is generous however I think the garnishes placed on top of the meat perturbed the awesome taste of the wagyu beef!
featuring from left to right, premium skewer wagyu short ribs ($6), classic skewers ($2 each) negima (chicken thigh with leek), pork shoulder and tsukune (chicken meatballs). the wagyu short ribs were marinated with Guinness stout for 72hours, and sprinkled with some salt - gone within a few seconds. the short ribs were so juicy, tender and melt in my mouth! \n<br />the classic skewers were impressive as well with char-aftertaste, and the meat were marinated well. thou the leek was overgrilled and became dry! \n<br />definitely a good steal for the price, and even better than some of the Japanese restaurants.
I enjoyed the beef short ribs. So soft and smooth, it just slides down your throat. I really like the charcoal taste and comes with it. 
I didn\'t have much expectations for a hawker located yakitori store. But senses of \"being oh so wrong\" started tingling after I spied wagyu steak and iberico pork. The highlight has to be the beef short ribs. That precious three cubes of beef has be one of my best beef experiences summed up in one stick.
$6.50, beautifully crisped with yummy risotto rice and a lovely hint of curry. 
Tender and flavourful wagyu rump, $12/120g.
The must-try item at this yakitori joint in a hawker centre is this Japanese spin on Italian arancini – the crunchy, deep-fried breading encases tightly-packed Japanese rice drenched in sweet-spicy Japanese curry.
Skewers texture can be very subjective, so try it with an open mind.\n<br />{new blog post} •direct link in bio•
The wagyu beef short ribs (marinated for 72 hours with Guinness stout) is probably my pick among the rest. 🍢 Overall, hit and misses I would say, some tuning needed. More details on www.jacqsowhat.com (link in bio)
This will be good and perfect if it\'s a little less salty.
I wish the meat had been seasoned with a heavier hand, but the tender texture of this skewer was spot-on!
Slightly charred cubes with a distinct smokey flavour, WIN! 😍😍😍 Thank you dear @sophiensyy for the invite and @theburningoaksg for having us!! 😘
Probably my favourite of the yakitori that I tried here is this: cubes of beef short rib stewed for 3 whole days until tender, then grilled to attain a gorgeous crusty, charred exterior.
Now there is something DIFFERENT! .\n<br />|\n<br />To celebrate their Grand Opening, Chef Jeremy is selling their regular Yakitori at S$1.50 and S$6 for the Premium. Affordable pricing and good dinner location. .\n<br />|\n<br />Chicken Thigh - Basic Yakitori. Juicy thigh meat with sweet leek. Simple and comfort food. .\n<br />|\n<br />Chicken Ball - Soft and well seasoned. Some might like it firmer, some might like it softer. Sadly, he just couldn\'t please everyone. .\n<br />|\n<br />72hr Short Rib (Premium) - Marinated for 72hr and tenderized every single tendon. It literally melted in the mouth. Together with the guinness stout reduction provided a nutty sweetness to counter the saltiness. .\n<br />|\n<br />Pork Belly - This stick need a lot of tuning. The meat was tough and lacked of the caramelized fatty bits. Completed with green capsicum pepper purée which didn\'t really helped with flavor. .\n<br />|\n<br />Pork Cheek (Premiusm) - The acidity from the  Apple Purée soften the meat and leaved no trace of the pork smell. It will be better if the pork cheek is gaze with an apple based sauce. .\n<br />|\n<br />Overall, the stall still searching for their special Yakitori sauce and the taste still need to fine tuning but still worth a visit. Lastly thank you @sophiensyy for the invite.
|\n<br />Soft boiled egg with chef special black sauce. Break open the egg and let yolk mixed with the sauce. Still need some fine tuning but overall good eat. .\n<br />|\n<br />The Burning Oak\n<br />348 Bedok Rd\n<br />Singapore, 469560
To make thing interesting, he is not selling regular hawker food. .\n<br />|\n<br />To kick start our meal, Chef Jeremy prepared two cocktails to open up our appetite. .\n<br />|\n<br />Sake Oishii - The savory tingling sensation from the black olive made this drink very interesting. It was like a Japanese Version Margarita. .\n<br />|\n<br />Sake Sunrise - The strong contrast between the orange and grapefruit caused an illusion of sunrise. A fruity and refreshing beverage to start with.
the skewers though could be better. \n<br />on another note, the relentless heat is back again after yesterday\'s tears
The entire place is pretty cool with the interior design! Anyway, we were here for @theburningoaksg, which serves Japanese yakitori! My picks are the pork cheeks, chicken meatballs and beef short ribs!😋 other choices include, pork belly and chicken thighs! 😊
One of my favourite dish at the tasting yesterday. Thank you @sophiensyy for the invitation and thank you @theburningoaksg for having us. ☺️
Tasting at a one-week-old yakitori stall at the recently revamped Bedok Market Place earlier today. There are some nice gems here, though I think the self-taught chef-owner still needs to fine-tune the flavours and grilling on the whole. Prices are really affordable ($1.50 to $6 per stick), though, so do come and show some love!
Here\'s Japanese curry risotto balls 🍢 The rest of the skewers prob need more work though.
First dish served was this soft boiled egg with their homemade sauce. They serve innovative Yakitori, photo and details of the Yakitori will be up at a later post.
Not really impressed with both chicken sticks. Chicken thigh was not very tender and the chicken balls had flavour only on the outside. \n<br />The pork dishes were better especially with the help of the sauces (capsicum and apple purée). I liked the texture of the pork cheek. \n<br />The best was saved for last. A must try is the beef short ribs here! Not featured is the  Japanese Curry Risotto Ball, which is a delight!
The hawker centre in itself is a cool place to check out. Reconstructed stalls to look like rows of shophouses, with many interesting cuisines like Vietnamese and Ramen. \n<br />Back to this dish, the soft boiled egg is served with The Burning Oak\'s signature homemade  sauce. At the moment it is nameless but definitely memorable.
From The Burning Oak at Bedok Market Place. These Curry Risotto Balls makes for such great sides to go along with the various sake cocktail concoctions they serve! Each golden-brown crusty balls comes with Japanese rice with piping hot Japanese curry sauce smothered all over within. Would hit fans of Japanese Curry Croquettes!
From The Burning Oak at Bedok Marketplace. An unnamed dish for now, it is served as a Molten Egg sitting atop an in-house secret sauce with bonito flakes, chili flake and black Olive powder. Taste-wise it seemed fairly reminiscent of the Japanese Cold Tofu, while adding that exciting element of the broken egg with flowing egg yolk into the dish.
Juicy slices of Wagyu beef that were so soft and not having a single trace of tendon. Minced Wagyu was equally flavourful and well marinated! Mixed in the onsen egg, there you have a hearty bowl of goodness. This is worth every penny. 😍\n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan
They have large blowers to keep the whole place cool which was extremely useful in our weather.\n<br />*\n<br />The whole purpose of visiting Bedok Market Place was to try out Burning Oak. Besides the don which was super delicious, we also ordered the slow cooked pork cheek ($12) and the 72 hour short rib ($6 per skewer). They were very flavourful and definitely value for money.\n<br />*\n<br />A word of warning though, you would probably want to share these dishes. Otherwise you may find them too rich and fatty.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_burningoak #burningoak #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It was very well charred and super yummy. At a cost of $22 though, you do begin to compare it with those served in air-conditioned restaurants. It is nonethelsss still pretty affordable. The hawker centre was also cool and comfortable with a modern hipster feel to it.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_burningoak #burningoak #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I had truffle Waygu bento (1st pic) while @erdionnn had Foie Gras and pork cheek bento (2nd pic). Very delicious and tasty - and also expensive too for a food centre :( ...

Wagyu rump cap M4/5 nicely grilled and tender! Adore this meat!!!!
Friday lunches are the times where you go further for good food. Impromptu decision made together with @lovelee_ruijun to go for burning oak
Delicious and tender pork cheeks and wagyu beef ramp cap rice don!

A fusion of Italian risotto and Japanese curry spices, all creamy and nice snugged under the golden bread crumbs!

Melts in mouth pork!!
Lunch at Burning Oak
$2/stick, except for the absolutely delish, tender wagyu short ribs that was slightly crisp on the side with a hint of sweetness in its marination ($6). The rest were pretty decent, another favourite was the salmon. Chicken ball was a little soft but we thought it was quite tasty.
To receive a truckload of JB Kampong eggs to me is one of the most romantic fantasy I have. 😍🍳😍🍳😍🍳 #DontCareCholesterolHigh #EatTheYolk #EggyAffair #EiLeanDiet #Eggs #Paleo #RealFood #EileenFoodTasting #OngsLaiJiak
I\'d rather do bbq at home. \n<br />good morning folks! what\'s up this weekend?
Tasted quite like a croquettes too! 😋 either way, it\'s a dish worth trying!😉👍
#OngsLaiJiak #EileenFoodTasting #Japanese #TheBedokMarketPlace
it\'s amazing how you can slowly find such items in our hawker setting.
And also their Japanese Curry Risotto Ball. Be sure to drop by! The Burning Oak is located at 348 Bedok Road, #02-16 Bedok Marketplace.
😋😋😋🍢🍢🍢 I specially love the 72-hour slow-cooked wagyu beef short ribs yakitori and salmon yakitori! Yum yum😋👌 #TheBurningOak #Yakitori #SgEats #SgFoods #WhenInSG #Burpple #Vsco #VscoEats #Singapore #VscoSg
Thank God work week is now officially off! Holiday tomorrow! Yipeee😁 @theburningoaksg
Give them a try!
My favorites are their pork cheeks and beef short ribs, they are so well marinated and tender. 😍
A week old yakitori stall at the newly renovated bedok marketplace. Hit and misses, the beef ribs and chicken balls were good though. Overall, the other skewers need more work to refine it.
The specialty of The Burning Oak would be their Yakitori, such as these (from left to right); Pork Belly with Green Apple Purée, Pork Cheek with Green Apple Coulis, Beef Shortribs, Chicken Meatball and Chicken Thigh. Favourite goes to the Chicken Meatball (loosely packed but still holds together well), Beef Shortribs (marinated for 72 hours and really tender and juicy) and Pork Cheek with Green Apple Coulis (crisp and smoky flavoured).
