EiGHT Korean BBQ - Invited Tasting - Bibimbap Bingsu (üíµS$28) House-made Milk Ice, Assorted Fruits, Marshmallows &amp; Crunch. üçß\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />So the house made milk shaved ice is something that I adore, coming from a guy who doesn\'t eat Bingsu much #kakigori &amp; #IceKachang. \n<br />It\'s Milky, Smooth &amp; almost Creamy. Topped with Red Beans, Strawberries, Oreo Crunch, Mango, Cornflakes, Grapes, Marshmallows, Kiwi, with Whipped Cream &amp; half of a can Peach. üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATSüíÆ: For üíµS$28 is expensive for a Bingsu, however if you consider the workmanship it takes for just an order of this is truly painstakingly time consuming. It\'s good don\'t get me wrong, but I\'d rather do 20 Ice Kachang &amp;/or 2 Kakigori. üññüèª
What\'s K BBQ without Makgeolli! The house brew makgeolli comes in its classic original form but also in other interesting flavours like passion fruit, green grape, organic honey and yucha. I\'m no way a yuzu person but this definitely left an impression. It\'s no doubt that a BBQ meal may get quite oily and all but the sips of citrusy makgeolli in between were super refreshing yet not too overpowering and did great work to cleanse the palate. Helps to prep yourself for more crispy pork bellies ahead! A jar of this size fills 4 cups.
Sunday lunch at 8 Korean BBQ with their 8 Colours Set - 8 types of marinated Mangalitza pork belly (Original, Wine, Garlic, Kalbi, Curry, Herb, Miso and Red Pepper Paste), free flow beansprouts and kimchi, a pot of bubbling hot army stew and banchan! Our meats were thoughtfully and expertly grilled, starting with the 4 lighter tasting ones before moving on to the heavier half. Flavours weren\'t overbearing and the glistening crispy pieces retained their juices so well! You can also get the 4 Colours Set at $58 instead if you want to leave some space to try their other BBQ items like the popular Korean Grilled Squid ($18).
Volcano fried rice. Pour the egg around the rice and wait for it to cook. Add cheese and seaweed ! Interesting !
A customized one of cause! Starting from $10.90, diners can now have an option to design their own bibimbap for lunch! My stone pot lunch consists of purple rice, spicy pork, saut√©ed mushrooms, kimchi, corn and an sous vide egg. Mix them up well with a side of gochujang sauce and you\'re all ready for a healthy Korean lunch.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @8koreanbbq\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />8 Korean BBQ\n<br />Address: 6, Eu Tong Sen Street, The Central, Unit 02-79/90, Singapore 059817\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #8koreanbbq
4 flavours of pork belly - original, garlic, galbi and gochujang! nice clean place with nice service staff cooking for you!
Eight 8 Korean BBQ now served DIY Bibimbap for lunch. Similar to the customizable salads, you can choose your preferred (Korean themed) ingredients and mix it in together in a hot plate. An affordable lunch option at $10+.
Until this Friday, you\'ll get to choose from a myriad of ingredients to customise your own Bibimbap at just $5++! But you better time your lunch hours correctly cause it\'s only available between 11.30am to 12.30pm and 1pm to 2pm.
Head to @8koreanbbq from the 17th to the 21st this month. There are two time slots: 1130-1230pm and 1-2pm. It\'s certainly a good deal not to be missed!\n<br />.\n<br />#bibimbap #koreanfood #ÎπÑÎπîÎ∞•
Cubed and grilled with thickly sliced onions and traditional mugwort rice cake. If you\'re a fan of thick, juicy slices of pork belly, this is for you! üê∑üê∑üê∑\n<br />.\n<br />This was taken at a media tasting.
The meat was tender with a hint of the flavors that we\'ve chosen since we ordered the 4 flavors pork. Wine, garlic, gochujang and herbs. I remember liking the gochujang one the most since the flavor is slightly saccharine and hence, bringing out the tenderness of the pork more than the other flavors. The squid was grilled just right by the waiter‚Äînot too chewy to the point you might wonder if you were doing jaw exercises. Perhaps it also has something to do with the freshness of the squid. It was quite addictive. Honestly, would go back if the price wasn\'t so steep. Nonetheless, I had an enjoyable meal.
weekend meat game strong.. a stop at @8koreanbbq - 4 flavors mangalica pork set ($58) and a slab of argentinian beef rib eye ($58). the mangalica pork of hungarian origin, touted as the kobe beef of pork was thick, lean and with melting fats without feeling sinfully heavy. suggest to go with one light flavor to enjoy the prized pork almost on its own and the rest with heavier flavors just for pure indulgence. awesome service but gwadd why issit so dark in there!

Since it was just the two of us, we went for the four colour set, with the recommended flavours garlic, miso, red pepper paste and kalbi. I realize cooking samgyeopsal is more of an aural than visual turn-on, that sizzle on the hot grill... Ooooh yeah.\n<br />:\n<br />In a short span of 5 minutes, the meat were all cut up and ready to enter the human chamber *rubs belly* The Mangalitsa pork has a much higher fat-to-meat ratio, and their marbling is touted to be the Kobe-beef equivalent, so be prepared to chew a lot more fat than usual. Our unanimous favourite was the miso, most savoury stand-out.\n<br />:\n<br />We also ate the seafood pancake, packed with shrimp, squid and chives, and was crisp and less dough-y, much to our liking.\n<br />:\n<br />I can\'t wait to go back soon to try the other four flavours!\n<br />#Burpple
One of my favourite items at 8 Korean BBQ‚Ä¶ how can you go wrong with a hotplate filled with rice, kimchi, egg and gooey cheese?\n<br />#8KoreanBBQ #KimcheeseFriedRice
Tonight, my usual favourite, the \"8 Colours Pork Belly Platter\" had to share the no. 1 spot in my heart with the incredibly tender Ribeye Steak. The friendly staff was skilled in grilling it to our requested medium-rare, rendering every slice velvety soft and wondrously juicy.
Specialising in the \'wagyu\' of Pork, they offer 8 different flavours of pork belly, served in a set! This is the smaller set of 4 flavours, good for 2 pax, served with 6 banchan side dishes, and 1 seafood soft tofu stew.
\nWhat I especially like about this Korean BBQ joint is their devotion to pork belly. The appropriately-named \"Big Hog Plate\" ($45++) is a gigantic, 1-inch thick slab of it that should easily fulfill most pork-lover\'s fantasies. It did mine. Furthermore, the staff even takes care of the grilling to ensure the meat is cooked to its optimum. As it sizzles away to perfection, you should do what I do - continue stuffing your face on their other tasty dishes.
I‚Äôm not usually a fan of chocolate desserts, but the combination of chocolate powder, marshmallows, chocolate ice cream and nutella is offset with fluffy, milky shaved ice making it a really refreshing chocolate treat. I could eat a whole bowl by myself.\n<br />#8KoreanBBQ #Bingsu *
Extremely flavourful especially my Favourite one - garlic. \n<br />Pictured here is the 8 Colour set ($98 - best shared with 4 people). Flavours ranged from wine, ginseng, red pepper, miso, curry and herb. \n<br />Taste great with some of their homemade kimchi (better after toasted on the grill pan and soaking up some of the porky juice üòã) and paired with their specialty Yucha Makgeolli that is so easy to drink. \n<br />Thank you for feeding us @eightkoreanbbq and @geekyelephant for extending the invite! A big thank you to @angwman for the Super warm hospitality, had an awesome time!
Chocolate lovers will definitely want to have a go at this, especially when there\'s chocolate brownies, chocolate balls and..(drums roll) nutella in it!! If you want to go into chocolate dreamland, this is it.\n<br />.\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @8koreanbbq and many thanks to @geekyelephant for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />8 Korean BBQ\n<br />Address: 6, Eu Tong Sen Street, The Central, Unit 02-79/90, Singapore 059817
A bibimbap that\'s not hot but cold? Not made of rice, meats and vegetables but fresh fruit, whipped cream and sweet toppings? Whatever this sorcery, it is a super \"cool\" way to end a pork belly BBQ feast!
Chocolate lovers will definitely want to have a go at this, especially when there\'s chocolate brownies, chocolate balls and..(drums roll) nutella in it!! If you want to go into chocolate dreamland, this is it.
The 8 Colours Set ($98) which comes with 8 flavoured mangalitza pork belly is very much preferred.
\nThese are not your ordinary pork belly but the healthier, premium-quality Hungarian Mangalitsa variant thank you very much. 
Those strands of nutella surprise within the snowy ice got me so excited like a girl who\'s going to tokyo next week.
I was surprised that @eightkoreanbbq actually has pretty legit bingsu!
Served in a stone bowl, the bingsu contains a rainbow of fresh fruits and medley of other toppings such as azuki beans, cereal and biscuit bits on top of the shaved milk ice. Definitely an ice blast to your palate after the hot and sizzling Korean BBQ session.
Understand that they have two versions now but we went for first version consisting of original, garlic, ginseng, red pepper paste etc. While meat here served are of premium quality, we can\'t help but wish there was more meat then fats.
A total feast for the eyes. This looked so nice that I almost wanted to try the it, but those tentacles‚Ä¶ üòñ\n<br />And at the back a row of 8 flavours of pork belly ready to go on the BBQ. üòã\n<br />Thanks to @8koreanbbq for this feast and @juliuslim for the invite.\n<br />#8koreanBBQ #GrilledSquid
With double the marbling than regular pork, the mangalitsa pork or \"the Kobe beef of pork\" will surely leave you with some luscious lips after the meal. The 8 Colours Set ($98) consists of eight marinated strips of pork belly with a unique flavour profile each. From wine (being the lightest) to red pepper paste (heaviest), each grill brings out a different experience of the pork when eaten with the fresh lettuce, grilled kimchi and bean sprouts. Besides the grilled meats, you can also opt for squid or even a pot of the army stew to go with your meal.
Served on a hotplate and stirred only at your table, you will get to witness how the egg and cheese coats the kimchi rice evenly and the bonito flakes \"dancing\" when in contact with heat. The best part? The crispy rice bits that creates an additional crunch and flavour.
Mad love for this plate of Kimcheese Fried Rice, made in true blue Yoogane style. Sour-savoury kimchi fried rice topped with cheese and a raw egg. Mix it all in together for a sinful gooey ball of flavour. And kudos to Eight for adding the bonito flakes, which heightens the pleasure of the dish. Thanks Eight for hosting and Juls for asking me along! 
It\'s actually bingsu! One of the most dressed-up photo-worthy desserts, the generosity of ingredients was a plus, but I still prefer the usual bingsu flavours better. üåüüåü
The famous 8 Colours Set ($98) comes in two versions with a mix of different flavours. Unfortunately, half the flavours from both sets were not available, so we didn\'t really get the whole point of it. Overall it was yummy, and the portion sufficient for 4 people, especially with the addition of a stew which is included in the price (if I remember correctly). But we couldn\'t tell much difference between the various flavours we ordered. üåüüåüüåü
We chose garlic, curry, red pepper paste and kalbi flavour and the meat was decent! The army stew was alright, though the ingredients weren\'t plentiful. 2 of us spent $80 in total, which was a bit pricey but yay for BBQ!
More gochujang in the lettuce
Means I must meet that tall order and it‚Äôs for you! And it‚Äôs for you in sense that eight pork bellies also staring at me, it‚Äôs also for me! It‚Äôs for us. And since the result is good, aigoo.. Thumbs up man!
|\n<br />Other than the shaved ice and whipped cream weren\'t chocolate flavored, you could almost find all kind of chocolate in this one dessert.
After the grill was moist by the pork belly, the waiter followed by grilling the mushrooms. They soaked up the lard and finished off with a knob of garlic butter. Must Try!
The 8 Colours Set experience could be compared to your first time teaching a class of eight precocious and gifted kids - you can easily differentiate between them (with the help of the name tags, of course) and they all possess a common underlying brilliance, but once they all go through the same standardised education system, only one or two manage to out-class participation the others and distinguish themselves. Undeniably good Mangalitsa pork belly, though. 3.8/5
Tried many dishes from the Spring Onion Salad to the Bingsu and must say that I am impressed by what they have to offer. Banchan was addictive, the squid was chunky, the Mangalitsa Pork Belly melts in the mouth and the mushroom comes slathered in a sinful yet fragrant garlic butter. Definitely had a meaty good time here, and that the service was decent considering they actually cook everything for you, and you don\'t leave smelling too much like BBQ. Definitely somewhere to consider if you are bringing a bunch of hungry meat-loving friends for gatherings.
This wasn\'t really up to my tastebuds. Despite the finely shaved milk, the massive amount of ingredients on the Bingsu made the dish feel like a mess; a splash of flavours that definitely does not become revolting but rather clashing to the tastebuds by overpowering one another. No doubt a showstopper in its right in terms of aesthetic and instagrammability, but the regular Chocolate Bingsu that we had also tried wins in terms of flavour and practicality.
The tender and juicy pork. Skip the soy bean paste seafood soup, its the worse soupi have ever drink!
In 8 Korean bbq, there are different types of marination, We ordered the 4 taste (8 taste was too much); original, kalbi, garlic and red pepper. The kalbi and the other marination which i couldn\'t tell was which were a little too sweet for my liking but overall the pork was really tender.
The best bingsu I\'ve ever had!! It\'s $18 for a bowl but good to share between 2-3 people! üòã
It feature slices of Mangalitza pork belly in an array of flavours. I would say this has got to be one of the best Korean BBQ establishment imo. More details on the blog, jacqsowhat.com üòâ
Oh wait, the weather is üò°üò• shall have [Bibimbap Bingsu S$28] instead! 8 toppings on shaved ice, good for 2 pax or more. It is quite creative, but a little too pricey for the quality. Available on weekdays from 11.30am to 2.30pm and weekends 11.30am to 4.30pm.
The ingredients in this case is represent by 8 different toppings such as azuki, Oreos, kiwis, mangos and more.
8 Colours Set [$98], 4 Colours Set [$58] &amp;\n<br />every set comes with a pot of normal stew.
8 Korean BBQ not only specializes in Managlitsa Pork, but they do have their very own strong points on their most recent launched dessert menu.
A beautiful mess filled with mozzarella cheese &amp; bonito flakes spread across the circumference of the 12\" hot-plate. (Definitely perfect for 3-4paxs!)
thereafter you\'ll place the whole chunk into your mouth and let the symphony of flavours take control. \n<br />I\'m missing this very much and I hope I\'ve tempted you enough.
I would consider this one of my healthy go to desserts. There\'s just so many fruits! And that cream! *love*! #Bingsu #8KoreanBBQ #Dessert
I\'m such a sucker for food that looks like one thing but turns out to be something completely different. 8 Korean BBQ has pulled out all the stops to present their very own version of bingsu (Korean shaved ice dessert) , cleverly disguised as bibimbap (Korean mixed rice), even going as far as to serve it in a massive hot stone bowl that\'s pre-frozen to help slow the melting process.
Had the pleasure of sharing this with the foodie gang. Loved the crunchiness of the soy beans sprouts in this. Everything works together when all mixed up including the kimchi, cheese &amp;  egg. A simple yet comforting dish to share.
Bibimbap Bingsu (S$28) - Bingsu in frozen granite stone \"pot\". 8 colorful toppings atop a bed of finely shaven milky ice, topped with an \"egg\" (peach &amp; whipped cream). The 8 toppings might change depending on what fruits are in season. We had mango, strawberry, oreo crumbs, granola, grapes, kiwi, marshmallows &amp; red beans.
Lunch earlier: kimchi-flavoured rice on a hotplate, topped with mozzarella, a raw egg, and bonito flakes. Mix everything together and what you have is an utterly scrumptious mess of piquant rice with threads of melted cheese that stretch apart as you scoop up spoonful after spoonful. Every mouthful is robust in flavour, nuanced with the subtle smoky fishiness of the dried fish flakes.
This BIBIMBAP Bingsu is the first of its kind featuring 8 seasonal toppings such as mangoes, strawberries, kiwis, red beans, granola and more.
Behind the scene: Taking the comforting Korean Kimchi Fried Rice topped with cheese and bonito flakes. This is how we take pictures in low light environment, just flash the food with lighting.
The chilly weather today makes me crave for a steamy hot stew and some insanely mouth watering E!ght flavours BBQ Mangalitsa pork belly.
Half of the 8 Color Set version 2 all nicely grilled and ready to eat. They all look the same, but I can assure you that every row of pork tastes different thanks to their marinades.
But as long the meat is good who cares when we are having it. .\n<br />|\n<br />The waitress said the meat must grilled still slightly char then it was ready!!!!
8 Colour Set version 2.0 - Tried 8 different types of marinated Mangalitsa pork belly - Original, Pine, Green Tea, Yucha (Yuzu), Plum, Blackberry, Honey Ginger &amp; Kalbi. For the best belly experience, one should start from the lightest to the heaviest flavour, ie, start with Original &amp; end with Kalbi.
Lunch earlier with @alainlicious and @pigg0ink ‚Äì sampling the new set of marinated mangalitsa pork belly: Original, Pine, Green Tea, Yucha (Korean equivalent of yuzu), Plum, Blackberry, Honey Ginger, Galbi.
E!ght is a Korean BBQ restaurant whose specialty is samgyeopsal (pork belly akin to incured bacon) in 8 unique flavours such as Green Tea, Blackberry, Yuzu etc.\n<br />|\n<br />Such quality meats is definitely worth e moolah, will be back! Thank you @8koreanbbq for having us üòã

üôÜüôÜSuper early christmas treat of 8 rolls of pork belly with pork belly kimchi stew. BEST in Singapore. It is not cheap, but hey you are paying for quality!We left the plate of vegetables untouched, such unhealthy diet! üòíüòíüòÇ
8 colour set is to die for. If I was a cow with 4 stomach, I\'ll have it all myself along with the Wagyu Ribeye. Go in groups so you can get everything on the menu: octopus, spring onion salad, pork belly, wagyu, ginseng chicken 
Reasonably spacious interior, but would be good to have more table space as the BBQ oil tends to splatter all over and the heat can be a little unbearable. Good for groups as most tables can fit up to 8+ pax or act as communal tables. Interior lighting is a little dark. Might just be me as I like to see my food more clearly &gt;.
K BBQ again~ This place is a little stuffy as you can really feel the heat from the BBQ. Their signature marinated hog meat is super fatty, although the menu says it\'s healthy, depends if you like the texture of fats. For the limited menu, this place is slightly over priced compared to other popular K-BBQ joints around. Spent about $175 for 2.5pax #burpple
Sinful indulgence once in awhile. With the poly peeps. Yums yums!! No pictures of the super yummy molten lava cake as well. Heh. (*^Ôπè^*)
A tad pricey but really good, thick fresh cuts of meat. The pork belly was way too fatty and oh-so-sinful... personally prefer the beef slices and short ribs, yummy stuff! The staff will cook the meats for you, which is really nice. The side dishes, bean sprouts and kimchi are refillable.
From bottom to top it\'s herb, curry, miso and Red pepper.  Everyone had their own favourites.
From bottom to top,  it\'s wine, original, ginseng and garlic. Different tastes for different folks. I like the garlic one.
Beef Soup that came with the set. Great accompaniment to the bbq.
Kimchi and bean sprouts on the grill.  Yummy  accompaniments to the pork belly.
Total of 8 favors - wine, original, ginseng, garlic, herb, curry, miso, red pepper paste. Set includes a seafood bean paste stew. Value for money! üëç

Just debuting a day ago... cheesy pork ribs.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Cheese cheese and glorious cheese surrounds the round hot stone. Waiting for it to melt requires alittle patience. Once gooey, do the pull, the stretch and finally the twirl round the pork rib. Last thing to do, eat and be merry. Pork atad spicy and marinades was quite tantalising. But eat abit fast cos cheese will harden after awhile. It is absolutely cheesy rich.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Thank you @littletinysun for the invite and @8koreanbbq for hosting.
no, the drink is not orange in color. A fluke shot I took just at that split second when my foodie friend was snapping her shot. üî∏üî∏\n<br />This is Makgeolli. Organic and a slightly sweet alcoholic drink which is creamy white in color. I do not take alcohol but from what I observe, the consistency is slightly thick. Bland in taste. Sweeteners like honey is added for extra flavor for the sensory.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Thank you @8koreanbbq for hosting and @littletinysun for the invite.
Try this Mangalitsa pork belly in 8 different marinades: Wine, Original, Garlic, Herb, Curry, Miso, Red Pepper Paste, and Kalbi! ($98) Our favourites were the garlic, curry and red pepper paste üòã Love how they put the cabbage and bean sprout kimchi on the side of the grill pan, heated up the kimchi without making them soggy! üòç‚ò∫Ô∏èüç¥\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Have a great sunday everyone!

Using the meat of the Mangalitza (Mahn-ga-leet-za) a rare pig of Hungarian origin,\n<br />each piece of meat is grilled till it yields a tender succulence and yet manages to retain its juicyness.

And the taste of Bibimbap varies from the ingredients and sauces put on the bowl. Start off with one carbohydrate (white rice, purple rice, quinoa +S$3), one protein (spicy chicken, stir-fried pork, beef bulgogi) and also three complements. Lastly, pick a sauce (original-spicy or soy) to enhance your bibimbap. The presentation of the bibimbap has awaken all the senses even before I start to feast. Do note that Design Your Own Bibimbap is only available at 8Korean BBQ The Central at Clarke Quay.\n<br />.\n<br />Read on foodgem.sg/food/lunch-less-than-20\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks Cherry @8koreanbbq for hosting.\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine?\n<br />8 Korean BBQ\n<br />6 Eu Tong Sen Street, #02-79//90 The Central, 059817\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#8koreanbbq #KoreanFood #Bibimbap #FoodGemSG
üçß\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />So the house made milk shaved ice is something that I adore, coming from a guy who doesn\'t eat Bingsu much #kakigori &amp; #IceKachang. \n<br />It\'s Milky, Smooth &amp; almost Creamy. Topped with Red Beans, Strawberries, Oreo Crunch, Mango, Cornflakes, Grapes, Marshmallows, Kiwi, with Whipped Cream &amp; half of a can Peach. üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATSüíÆ: For üíµS$28 is expensive for a Bingsu, however if you consider the workmanship it takes for just an order of this is truly painstakingly time consuming. It\'s good don\'t get me wrong, but I\'d rather do 20 Ice Kachang &amp;/or 2 Kakigori. üññüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#8koreanbbq #koreanbbq #bibimbap #bingsu #sugarcakepie #korean #dessert #sugarhigh #shavedice #milk

Premium Mangalica pork belly, marinated in 8 different flavours!
Rich and creamy with fruity, zesty citus flavour! Wish I had some now.
@8koreanbbq might just satisfy that particular craving, the kimchi and the mangalista pork is especially rad :))\n<br />#manglistapork #8koreanbbq #koreanbbq #sgfood #foodporn #sgrestauranr #burpple
Ewww
Highly recommended, is the 8 Colors Set¬†($98) - perfect for a party of 3 to 4 guests. Mix and match between 8 different marinaded mangalitsa pork; wine, original, ginseng, garlic, herb, curry, miso paste and gochujang. And to further boost the holistic qualities of the set; it comes with a mini army stew chock full of ham, spam, baked beans, pork belly, noodles and kimchi. Nosh built for rainy days or to soothe you into the start of a daunting week of work
Followed swiftly by this {Never to Mat-cha Bingsu} at @8KoreanBBQ || my firm recommendation should you be thinking of a relief from the fatty mangsalita pork belly experience
Fit for 4, this will send your targets to embark on any sort of diet plans on an immediate downward spiral

I WANT MY PORK BELLY NOW!
üòãüòç But ... The kimchi stew that came with their 8 flavours set ($98++) was a huge disappointment, too blend and tasted like water with red colouring.
DAEBAK. So many 8s. Even got 8 flavored Mangalitsa pork belly. Confirm HUAT.
You\'ll be able to choose from different marinated pork belly and we chose wine, herb, miso &amp; garlic. The wine &amp; miso was the best for me cause it was well marinated. Other than that, they have bean sprouts and kimchi on be bbq pan to be warmed up. #cheryleatsalot #burpple #vscocam #8koreanbbq

I cannot repeat this enough - Fats = Flavour. I really love animal fats. A LOT. When strips of Mangalitsa belly made their grand appearance right under my nose, I almost went into bouts of hyperventilation. Woo hoo!Now, let\'s meat\" the 8 Colour Version Set 2.0. \n<br />Flavours(From bottom up) - Original, Garlic(‚úîÔ∏è), Smoked(‚úîÔ∏è), Yucha(‚úîÔ∏è), Plum, Blackberry, Honey Ginger(‚úîÔ∏è), Kalbi. The ticks represent the flavours that I like!Hai yah, in any case, pork belly is always delicious. What made the dining experience more enjoyable is that you will not leave the place smelling like bacon! The exhaust system here is üëç.

what more can you ask for? you can eat it mixed or separately, the choices are there for you.
So big!!! But I love the presentation.
It will be even better if more cheese is added! üòÑ
it\'s Tuesday! but there\'s nothing to look forward too.
I guess we all need this as we experience such crazy weather on our sunny island.
