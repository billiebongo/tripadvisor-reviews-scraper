I came to one conclusion, if the sushi is done fluffy and light, no matter how much, you\'ll have no problem to conquer them. Kambate!
Another Omakase item which came unnamed. The thick slab of unagi (eel) was almost unreal. Drawing similar concept as modern flooring solutions (Engineered Wood) I recently had more interaction with, I call this a re-engineered unagi cake, as the unagi was sliced slide way and sandwiched an unagi fish-cake!
Too pretty to eat. Fantastic platter of combination of flavours and texture: 甘海老, 炙り帆立貝、大トロ、smoked 烏賊、鯖、鯛。
It\'s raw pink! Out of this world, best world of grill/ sashimi 
メカジキ巻き unlike any others you\'ve tried before. Dressing was a little too heavy.
Tatsu had was comfortably packed when I visited during lunch on a Tuesday, meaning it had enough customers to not worry me about it\'s survival and at the same time, not make me wait for my seat. Apart from the Unagi x Avocado and the Negi Toro which are what their name suggests, the Salmon Aburi is one that comes with a little surprise: creamy cheese in the middle of the sushi roll. I was pleasantly surprised by the affordability of Tatsu given it\'s location and outlook. Will definitely be back here again to try more stuff! 
Homemade tofu with century egg sauce. This one from Tatsu is topped with fish roe and the sauce is lightly spiced. Review up on blog! Link in bio! #sgfood #sgfoodporn

Did not think much about a jellyfish appetizer although my regular trusted restaurant manager, Jack, insist I try. It\'s like no other jellyfish I\'ve tasted. The texture is so interesting I wouldn\'t mind a second serving. But no, good stuff always comes in portion that makes you feel its not enough but only just, satisfied only on your next trip.
Botan Ebi, Otoro, Chutoro, Hotate
Cod fish &amp; prawn combo
Superb slicing skills demonstrated in this very thinly sliced beef.
White Tuna anyone? #eatclean #sashimi
