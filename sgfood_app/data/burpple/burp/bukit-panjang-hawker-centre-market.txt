It was refreshing to have with its rich taste that can also be rather filling to have!
However, the noodles here lacked of the texture and was rather soggy.
The braised egg, braised tofu and gravy were not too spectacular.
Pretty good, but one of them is overly starchy and floury on the inside. The dipping sauce is so good though. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br /> #singapore #food #foodstagram #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodgasm #foodspotting #instafood #instagood #instagramers #yummy #amazing #iphonesia #lefooding @lefooding #picoftheday #photooftheday #igdaily #sgeats #sgfood #whati8today #iweeklyfood #eatoutsg #burpple #bukitpanjang #bukitpanjanghawkercentre #indianrojak
The noodles are also not overcooked, resulting in a springy texture!
The amount of beef rendang given may be little but the meat is tender and flavourful!
