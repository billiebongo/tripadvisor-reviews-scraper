Loving the golden crispy edged egg prata that wasn\'t too oily. Accompanied with a little spicy and sour fish curry was a perfect combination of both! 
Love this prata so much! The crispy prata with nicely pan fried ham, poached egg and  hollandaise sauce! Is just too perfect for me! 💜
Even more generous serving of their hollandaise sauce compared to the last time I came here and a perfectly done poached egg that drizzles sooooo well when cut, with the crispy prata combination, it\'s definitely a guilty pleasure that is worth the calories. 🙃\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Had soup kambing, the broth was so.... Damn good!! Seriously worth the try! Total spent here of $48
No matter where I go for prata. Paper prata is a must order! The paper prata here so crispy and nicely drizzled with condense milk. For sweet tooth lover! 
Cheap, good and variety of prata to choose from! A must try!!!!! 
thin crispy prata with chicken floss, chicken luncheon meat, cheese, egg &amp; mayonnaise 
If you’ve never had at least one of the ridiculous murtabak inventions here, then you’re seriously missing out. It’s probably best to go with a bunch of hungry big eaters so you can try more. Go for the Ultimate Murtabak ($12) stuffed with tender chunks of tandoori chicken and a thick layer of oozing mozzarella studded with mushroom slices, or the Umami ($7.50), brimming with chicken luncheon meat, chicken floss, Japanese mayonnaise, egg and mozzarella. They also created the patty and cheese-filled Murtaburger ($7) and the eggs benny-inspired Plaster Blaster ($5).\n<br />*Halal-certified
Ordered this for two, it was more than enough. The filling of chicken, cheese and mushroom was generous. Price: $12. 
Look at the cheese stretch!!!!! YES, the Ultimate Murtabak from Springleaf Prata Place is worth 5 exclamation marks as it was just that good. The smokey flavour from the chunks of Tandoori chicken and the earthy taste of the sauteed portobello mushrooms with mozzarella cheese, was super shiok. It was my first murtabak but I think it is the best murtabak in Singapore with its perfectly crisp exterior and generous filling! Good for sharing though you might not want to!
East meets West in this explosive combination of poached egg, Indian Hollandaise sauce, ham and Prata. Available in both the east and west side of Singapore, and not for the calorie counters. 
This gourmet mixture was covered with a thin and crispy layer of prata and blasted with melted cheese. \n<br />While all the ingredients may sound ordinary, you’ll have to taste it to believe how irresistible each bite is.\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Plaster Blaster Prata ($5) - Ingenious fusion with the usual brunch affair aka egg benedicts, whereby a poached egg lay atop 2 pieces of turkey ham and kosong prata, indulged with hollandaise sauce. \n<br />The poached egg was masterfully executed and enriched the buttery kosong prata. You will be surprised how the hollandaise and curry sauce amplified each other’s flavour!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Springleaf\'s eggs benny-inspired Plaster Blaster ($5) comprises a crisp, fluffy plain prata topped with slices of ham and a wobbly poached egg smothered in Hollandaise sauce (though you might prefer ladling spoonfuls of good ol\' curry instead). When you break into that egg, watch as it mixes into the hollandaise (or curry) as you tear that prata apart. Come with a big group to try their ridiculous murtabak inventions, like the Ultimate Murtabak ($12) stuffed with tandoori chicken and oozing mozzarella studded with mushroom slices, or the Umami ($7.50), brimming with chicken luncheon meat, chicken floss, Japanese mayonnaise, egg and mozzarella. p.s. They created the patty and cheese-filled Murtaburger ($7) too.
Yesterday\'s awesome prata feast at Springleaf Prata Place! I just had to drag my friends and go all the way down to Jalan Tua Kong (Bedok) to stuff my face with prata after hearing about the special Umami 50 prata created for SG50 (50 cents off for the month of Aug) and it was worth the travel!! We over-ordered .... Okay actually I over-ordered because I live in the West so I have to try whatever I want before I make a 90-minutes journey home. The place was a little inconvenient to get to if you don\'t drive but the prata was so good.
A very intriguing marriage between Ms.Maggie Goreng and Mr. Prata. \n<br />Ms. Maggie Goreng seems to be the Alpha Female of this marriage as Mr. Prata gave way, softening his texture to let Ms. Maggie Goreng have her way. I wonder how long would this marriage last especially when sour tofu was in the picture.
This ingenious creation of Chicken Luncheon Meat, Chicken Ba Hu(Floss), Japanese Mayonnaise, Egg and Mozzarella Cheese!!\n<br />Dunk the prata in the curry provided and quickly sent it to your mouth as the savoury umami-ness unleash in your mouth. \n<br />I couldn\'t stop taking mouths after mouths of it, despite how sinful it was! It was just so YUMS!
[Springleaf Garden, Upper Thomson Road] Launched just over a day ago (1 August, 6pm to be exact), I was fortunate to be one of the first few patrons to have tried the dish that will be presented during the Ultimate Hawker Fest 2015. Named Umami 50 ($8), this dish coincided with SG50 and was strongly recommended by the staff upon seated. Without hesitation, I ordered a set and it was definitely umami to the max. With help from @ieatishootipost , Springleaf Prata manages to surprise us year after year with their Ultimate Hawker Fest creation. This year, Umami 50 is a prata that contains premium chicken luncheon meat, chicken floss, mozzarella cheese, mayonnaise and egg. With all these ingredients that go into this creation, how can one resist the temptation from not ordering it?
Super shiok for supper and better fot sharing.\n<br />Wish they didn\'t use minced chicken but chunkier bits of chicken. I liked the chopped onions within but the amount given could literally scare off a dozen vampires 😂
Super good crispy prata topped with ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce with a side of creamy thick curry!Super good can! \n<br />The prata here is something I really liked, crispy yet not dry, and greasy at the right amount 😊
[Siglap] Back in camp and so not looking forward to the outfield starting tomorrow. How I wish I could be out now having supper, more specially at Springleaf Prata Place for a Plaster Blaster with Masala Hollandaise Sauce ($5). This dish was created for the Ultimate Hawker Fest 2014 which proved to be an ultimate eggporn hit. Absolute kudos to the genius to come up with the innovative idea of stacking a plain crispy prata with slices of ham, a poached egg and homemade masala hollandaise sauce. Can\'t wait for Ultimate Hawker Fest 2015 which I heard that they will be participating and introducing another one of their new creations. Till then, I can dream about it as I lay on my bunk bed and try to fall asleep. #hawkerpedia
You might have ordered mee goreng, maggi goreng and bee hoon goreng before. But have you tried Prata Goreng ($4) yet? By the wonderful people behind Springleaf Prata Place, plain prata are being chopped up and fried ala maggi goreng style. It sounds weird initially to have fried prata but it\'s so unique that you end up finishing the entire plate. Do give this a try and their other Ultimate Hawker Fest items when you are there.
The first time I found out about this \"hipster\" prata was from my boyfriend last year. He mentioned about how far the place was, in some ulu place all the way in the East. So I decided to curb my curiosity for the past 6 months until I talked to my guardian about it and he said \"It\'s just 2 mins drive from my house!\" And so we went today.
There is an immense satisfaction to be derived from shattering the brittle, paper-thin pancake pyramid into pieces with your hands, then scooping up the tasty sauces with the broken shards of thosai. Said sauces are a cooling coconut chutney, a sambar(or lentil curry) with bits of vegetables, and a mildly spicy chilli or tomato chutney. The thosai was crispy around the edges and slightly chewy in the middle, as a good thosai should be. 
The 2012 Ultimate Murtabak ($12). Feeds 3 comfortably. Huge chunks of tandoori chicken topped with generous portions of portobello mushrooms and infused with mozzarella cheese! Tastes really fan-fking-tastic! Other must-trys include the prata bomb, portobello mozzarella and the plaster blaster
I already fancy their flaky, crispy prata. Chopped up and stir-fried with the same ingredients that go into their mee goreng transforms it into an entirely new beast. And a tasty one to boot.\n<br />Granted the prata did lose a little of its crispiness but making up for that in a big way are the soft tofu cubes, broken-up egg, crunchy cabbage and \"chye sim\". Expect to be whacked head-on by their spicy chilli paste too. 
I\'ve been a regular at Siglap for the last 3 years and have completely missed this gem. Like its name, Plaster Blaster was a blast, combining the best of breakfast choices - prata &amp; eggs benedict. Pro-tip: add a dash of curry to every bite. That combination of the runny egg yolk and rich curry is memory to behold! 
Back in 2012 when Springleaf Prata Place participated in the Ultimate Hawker Fest, they gave us the Ultimate Murtabak ($12). Glorious chunks of tandoori chicken, bountiful bits of portobello mushrooms and cheesy mozzarella singing in harmony, hidden inside the prata dough. Where have you been all these while?
Eggs Benedict meets crisp, flakey prata in this clever creation. I\'m not too fond of the \'Hollandaise\' sauce though – it\'s a little too tangy for my liking, almost as if it\'s mayonnaise-based rather than a buttery yolk emulsion. I enjoyed this more with the curry sauce. 
This is what a call a successfu-sion! If you love red bean, this is the best version of any kind of fried dough with red bean ever. Thin, crisp, with just the right amount of filling, what a nice way to end the meal. 
What makes this really good is not just the genius combination that\'s bound to work, but the fact that the prata itself is so good. I\'ve been on the hunt for pratas that truly satisfy for so long now, with so many disappointments along the way, but the prata itself totally made my day. I preferred this when I scraped most of the sauce off the egg and doused it in curry instead!
Resistance is futile. Why have people not put tender chunks of tandoori chicken, a thick layer of oozing mozzarella and mushrooms together in one murtabak before? The best part is how thin and crispy the prata itself is, the most perfect shell for these tasty, tasty fillings. Smother it all in fish curry, and share this between 4 comfortably along with a plaster blaster each. That is how you brunch. 
The key is to eat this Portobello mushroom and mozzarella cheese prata while it\'s still hot, so the cheese is still ooey, gooey and stretchy and not take a bazillion photos like me.
Crispy prata, topped with turkey ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. Yep eggs ben prata! Friends felt the sauce was a little odd, but I was okay with it. Interesting, I guess but we\'ll just stick to ordering the ultimate murtabak!!!!!
This ultimate murtabak is the nicest I\'ve had so far!! Tandoori chicken, portobello mushroom and mozzarella cheeeeeeese. Either I\'m a messy eater or it was really quite juicy (ok at least I think whatever that was wasn\'t oil hahahahaha ). Smoky and flavourful. Giant portion for $12, good for 2 or 3 pax? We also ordered the portobello mozzarella prata which was damn good too. quite similar to this, just without the yummy chicken so I\'d definitely prefer this. I might be dreaming of this tonight!!
If you want something sweet to end your meal with, this is it. This was so thin, so light and crispy!! We loved this. Finished it up even though we were damn full. Got this for free with the pickat sg app for orders more than $15.
Craving for prata naooo. Especially the red bean prata from Springleaf (not in picture). It was complimentary (we spent over SGD15) but it was so good! Crispy &amp; light. Anyway, we totally over-ordered that day to celebrate Z\'s thesis submission. We had the Plaster Blaster (SGD5), Ultimate Murtabak (SGD12), Portobello Mozzarella Prata (SGD5), &amp; Masala Chicken (SGD3) (anti-clockwise from left). Didn\'t really enjoy my Plaster Blaster. Either the mock hollandaise sauce was weird or the turkey ham was not fresh. But the Ultimate Murtabak was really delish &amp; ultimate! 👍 Portobello Mozzarella Prata was shiok too. &amp; to top it off, the drinks came in giant cups. I took forever to finish my teh halia because the ices kept melting haha. Alright back to studying...
Prata is the quintessential trans-boundary food that is loved by many from different countries. It can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner and even supper. In recent times, many prata houses have started experimenting with the ingredients that go into a plain prata by adding things like cheese, chocolate and many others. In my opinion, Springleaf Prata Place has got to be one of the more successful ones. Their Portobello Mozzarella Prata ($5) is so good that it\'s like an Asian \"pizza\". What\'s more, they have specific curries to go with the type of prata you ordered - a sign of quality and attention to details. Have I made you hungry yet?
Two words: DAMN. SHIOK.\n<br />It may not be obvious in my pic but the mozzarella cheese was indeed ooey-gooey. That and the meaty portobello mushroom were just fantastic with prata\'s thin and crispy dough. Every bite got me a full-bodied mouthful that was really delicious, with and without the accompanying curry. The prata wasn\'t as big as I envisioned but with something so robust in taste, size can take a backseat. In fact, I had only half of it because I couldn\'t resist ordering an egg and green chilli prata too 😁\n<br />And who can I credit (or blame!) for what\'s possibly my new favourite prata? Answer: Burpple Tastemaker Jason Wong. He got me all hot and bothered over it with his Burp from some time back. Thanks ah Jason 😆😆
Generous chunks of portobello mushroom folded in with stretchy, gooey mozarella in a crisp prata parcel. What\'s not to like? I come here way too often.
The next best thing to sleeping in on the weekend is waking up to this. Eggs Benedict and turkey ham atop a flaky, slightly crisp on the outside prata. Not served with curry by default, but definitely ask for it, as it is by far one of the best prata curries I\'ve tasted, rich and full flavoured, with a tantalizing hint of cardamom. $5
Finally got to try out one of the dish for ultimate hawker fest 2014, the Prata Blaster! 👳\n<br />Their signature crispy prata topped up with Turkey Ham, Poached egg and their own Indian hollandaise sauce, the dish is absolutely perfect when fused together! Just wow ☺️, so yummy! \n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
isn’t it much prettier stacked up like that? i think i took longer to slice it up than to gobble the whole thing down 🤣
all these melting goodness of cheese is just the perrrrrrrrfect amount for me to cap off a midweek evening 😋 yes, i did ask for extra cheese. so sue me 😝\n<br />.\n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple @hungrygowhere #hungrygowhere #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #singaporefood  @singaporeeats #singaporeeats #eatlocal #jiaklocal #hawkerfood #hawkerfare #breakfast #brunch @springleafprataplace #springleafprataplace #prata #alfredoprata #meltingcheese #cheese #cheeseporn
