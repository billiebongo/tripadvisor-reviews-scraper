Cheesy!
Topredo Fries (basically cheese fries) were not bad though and $1.50 coleslaw. Not bad I guess when you crave processed food. Still rly sad about my sandwich 😭

Overall not bad. Good service.\n<br />Shrooms  \n<br />To those cheese lovers. You won\'t sick of their cheese! Their fries kinda big and easily soggy.
