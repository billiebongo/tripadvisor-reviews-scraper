Get to savour their Signature Soy Sauce Chicken, with a hint of flora sweetness from the rosewater (traditional ingredient) added.
Har gao! Dad loves this! All the more reason for the family to come back again.
It\'s as good as promised! And it\'s really crowded here today! Must have something to do with the spread in the newspaper.
one of my rare favorite CHINESE desserts and I got to say I was impressed by this beancurdskin and barley with gingko nuts. not everyday do you find great tasting ones because it is so difficult to get such a simple dish right. spot on for me. tried this yet?
Here\'s fish maw &amp; prawns w glass noodle in homemade XO sauce. So good 😋
Light, sweet and subtle soy saucr much like how classic cantonese cuisine should be.
This wet Thursday, I\'m seriously looking forward to slurping up this wholesome dish of seafood-y goodness. Wok-fried vermicelli nestles in a viscous sauce littered with egg white, clumps of crabmeat, shredded dried scallop AND chunks of fresh scallop. A raw egg yolk beams from the middle, surrounded by a swirl of vinegar and pepper. Yummmmm.
I\'m at risk of raising expectations too high if I rave about this, but I can\'t help it because this chicken is that good. The ultra-tender meat (even the breast part!) soaks in the rounded saltiness of the superior soy sauce its doused in, while the slippery skin sings with the subtle sweetness of rosewater – an ingredient that\'s been used in Chinese cooking for eons, though it\'s such a hard flavour to balance that most restaurants choose not to bother with it altogether. 
So besides roast meats, soups, and a host of other incredibly yummy noodle, claypot and veggie dishes, Joyden Canton Kitchen also offers homemade desserts like mango pudding, mango sago, beancurd skin with barley and gingko nuts, and gui ling gao, all of which are right on the money. It sounds too good to be true, but I honestly believe that there\'s nothing Joyden does badly.

Rainy day comfort food is [SIGNATURE TRADITIONAL RICE VERMICELLI WITH POACHED EGG WHITE, CRABMEAT &amp; SCALLOP S$15.80] 
Had a bad day yesterday, but ended the night with really awesome homely comfort food &amp; the company of ❤️💋 friends! My mood brightened up instantly even until now! The power of food &amp; friends!\n<br />⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />My favourite dish from last night has got to be [FISH MAW AND PRAWNS WITH GLASS NOODLES IN HOMEMADE XO SAUCE S$18.80] - XO sauce has dried scallops and Jin hua ham, it\'s so tasty that I wished they sell the XO sauce in jars so I could lug them home. 
This is somewhat similar to the silky Hor Fun with Egg (滑蛋河), but instead of flat rice noodles they used rice vermicelli coupled with crabmeat, scallop and special sauce for the silky smooth texture. This is definitely my go to comfort food, and with that lovely poached egg it will never go wrong. 
You will find many types of braised pork ribs cooked in a variety of sauces but few serve them in aged mandarin peel sauce, which is a refreshing spin on the typical coffee or champagne variations. The smoky taste of this braised pork ribs dish is quite different from the rest, that is because the recipe yields from Joyden\'s own unique recipe. The rib meat is juicy and succulent, coated with a wonderfully tasty sauce which goes well with steamed rice. Pork meat lovers should totally go for this dish.
Those golden coin shaped like patties are made from homemade bean curd, seafood and vegetables then fried for a unique texture. Sitting on a bed of soft, young baby cabbage steamed in a viscous, milky and sweet superior pork broth. This signature dish is suitable for those looking for a healthy option, as it is packed with several nutritious components. 
I don\'t really fancy eating fish maw but this claypot dish of Fish Maw and Prawns with Glass Noodles in Homemade XO Sauce scored full marks in my book unexpectedly. This mouth watering dish stars a homemade XO sauce of dried scallops and premium Jin Hua Ham, that complements the chewy fish maw and springy glass noodles well. Although it was a little too spicy for me, it didn\'t stopped me from eating more. 
Claypot dishes are one of the key features on Joyden\'s menu. Here\'s a pot of comforting fish soup with sliced fillets from Grouper, a mild fish from the sea bass family known for its moist meat and high in oil content which can be paired with multiple food such as rice and vegetables and is great for cooking soup dishes. The flesh of the grouper is plump and tender, swimming in the delicately warm rice wine broth that doesn\'t scratch your throat or burn your tongue.
Another must try meat dish is the Traditional Hakka Salt Poached Farm Chicken, where the whole kampong bird is gently steeped with salt and herbal stock and then rested to fully absorb the flavours. Some Hakka or Cantonese restaurants offer salt baked chicken on the menu, but this is slightly different due to its preparation and cooking techniques. 
A simple Chinese soup can be surprisingly tasty with just chicken and coconut as the ingredients. The chicken yields the fragrance and natural sweetness from the old coconut flesh unexpectedly over three hours of slow cooking and steaming. This is the simplest, yet tastiest chicken herbal soup I tasted so far, and I almost cannot believe my taste bud, but it is true. 
Soy sauce chicken is probably one of the most popular Cantonese dish and the one at Joyden Canton Kitchen is a must try. The chicken is gently steeped in a secret blend of superior light sauce and other herbs, then skilfully poached to achieve that silky skin and tender, pull apart meat. 
One of the best I\'ve tried, and probably one of the most underrated because Joyden Canton Kitchen isn\'t even a month old yet. If you\'re a fan of salted egg custard buns, you need to get your butt down pronto. Available daily from 11.30am-4.30pm. 
Steeped in a special salt stock then rested to allow the meat to fully absorb all the flavours, this kampong chicken is served at room temperature, not chilled, because that\'s when its flesh is most tender. The homemade ginger sauce on the side is the perfect accompaniment to the salty meat. 
Am doing up the press release for this restaurant now, and giving myself major cravings for their nourishing soups and claypot specialities. Steamed for three hours in the coconut husk itself to extract all the flavours from chicken bones (and meat), coconut water, wolfberries and huai shan (a Chinese herb). The result is a relatively clear soup slightly clouded with disintegrated wisps of chicken, sweet yet nuanced with the mild herbal bitterness of the huai shan. 
Can\'t believe my 2 weeks of unemployment will be over in a matter of hours; tomorrow, I start from ground zero at my new workplace 😬 
This one is quite good!
We had the whole restaurant to ourselves.
Prices are a bit steep for their soups though $15.80 #burpple
Prefer the salted chicken. The ginger that comes with it is so addictive.
6 others think it\'s too potent and didn\'t like it. Lol.
This Mei Cai Kou Rou is so yummy. 😍

This 老火汤 really hit the spot with its subtle sweetness and light fragrance. If only they have a branch near my place. 😐

Love this aromatic soup! Must try!

The naughtiness of the rice wine struck quickly before sneakily vanishing into the darkness, leaving no traces behind in what is still a rather happy-tasting soup. 3.75/5

cooked entirely in the clay pot, all the flavours are trapped inside, giving the dish that splendid tasting flavour.🍴
a yolk in the centre to give it extra flavor. you can even taste that charred wok flavour. so pleasing to the senses. \n<br />something to think about for dinner tonight?
so tender, very well done.
