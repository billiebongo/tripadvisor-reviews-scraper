The lunch set here comes with a salad, chawanmushi, miso soup, and ice cream for dessert (would have prefer if they offer mochi tho). The Wagyu had a gorgeous marbling, tender pink on the inside with a nice sear on the outside. Each slice had a hint of truffle which further enhances the taste of the entire bowl. The rice and beef ratio was perfect, and when you pop the onsen egg and the yolk drizzled all over the rice, damnnnnn. Priced at only $45++, talked about a steal! Definitely worth every penny!
.\n<br />The bowl seduced with its heady aroma of truffle and smokiness once it was placed in front of us. The sliced wagyu steak, medium-rare, had a lightly charred flavours that gave depth to the perfectly pink and tender meat. Served alongside was a the most generous portion of foie gras I\'ve ever unearthed in a donburi! The meat was balanced against the essence of the sea with uni, caviar and ikura on top. This bowl is by no means affordable, but it certainly lived up to its price point and we were impressed by the quality! #burpple
My first time trying their Wagyu Don. This comes with a set of salad, miso soup, cawanmushi, and ice cream for dessert! It costs around $65. The place was decent and a quite far walk from the busstop.
Charcoal-grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg and shredded leeks over rice
Admittedly, just reading the menu of what goes into the Fatcow Premium Donburi had me whimpering in excitement.\n<br />At $98++, it is possibly the most decadent Japanese don (rice bowl) I have had to date. Served on a bed of rice were:\n<br />- A slab of Wagyu steak (I asked for mine to be done medium-rare and it was perfect)\n<br />- Pan-seared chunks of creamy foie gras\n<br />- Bafun uni \n<br />- Ikura\n<br />- Caviar\n<br />- Onsen egg
On the opposite end of the spectrum from our uber fresh sashimi was this outrageously good hot appetiser.\n<br />Braised in the savoury-sweet dark sauce were chunky pieces of Wagyu beef tendon, foie gras and Japanese radish. They\'d all been reduced to their respective singular finest quality of ooey-gooey stickiness, meaty creaminess and palate-cleansing freshness.\n<br />What made each stand out so deliciously was precisely why they harmonised so well too. 
All we ever needed to keep a smile on our faces for the whole day.\n<br />Generous servings of tender Wagyu steak, creamy smooth foie gras, fresh punchy Uni, juicy Ikura and caviar with a perfect plump Onsen egg.\n<br />Lost for words to describe the satisfaction after finishing the last bits of rice in our bowls.
This is Fat Cow in a bowl and executed with a plum. Medium rare, gorgeous marbling and wonderful seasoning; with the onsen egg added to the mix to give it some texture and taste complexity. $45 for a lunch set, talk about good value.
Nicely done Foie Gras &amp; beef don. Great quality beef but for the price of ~$60, it\'s a been there done that for me. Would satisfy my craving at a cheaper don place.
🍴\n<br />I like how there\'s a wedge of lime to cut the fattiness of the beef to allow you to keep eating. 🤤 We ordered the Miyazaki grade A4 striploin and the Tochigi grade A5 ribeye, both grilled over charcoal. The fragrance of charcoal really hits you when it arrives. Miyazaki has less marbling, and an almost tuna like texture that melts in your mouth. Tochigi has more marbling and really melts in your mouth (because of the fats) and can be more gelat to eat. 🍴\n<br />We had slowcooked of tendon, creamy crab cakes and tempura moriawase for sides. Can\'t say much abt the tendon but the braise was definitely good. 👍🏻 The foie gras was also plump and creamy. Crab cakes were really creamy, though would be nice to have a little more crab meat. As for the tempura. It was a disappointment 🙁 The batter lacked flavour and it was too oily. Just meh. 🍴\n<br />For my love of mochi, le fiancé allowed me to have it 🤣 Though @timchee counted that its $2 per piece 🙊 It was delicious when you coat the mochi w lot of soy flour and matcha powder tgt w the kuromitsu. However, felt that the texture could be improved on. It felt like they had added tapioca flour instead of pure bracken flour. 🤔 🍴\n<br />I would say their service is great, but for the price we are paying, would have preferred a better ambience. They had odd dividers in the dining space and uncomfortably close tables. 🤷🏻‍♀️\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #fatcow #steak #datenight
Finally tried the famous donburi at Fat Cow! Loved the thick and big slices of medium rare Wagyu beef and every bit of the foie gras. Imagine having all these to go with the caviar, ikura &amp; onsen egg. Heavenly!
This was the most amazing meal of my life, made more amazing by the entertainer app, and that I was treated to this for my birthday. This beats ANY bowl of beef don HANDS DOWN, and it is worth every single cent that you spend (eating 10 bowls of $10 beef dons don\'t give you such satisfaction). Everything goes well together in the bowl, and every mouthful is like a flavour explosion. The foie gras was seared perfectly, beef was nicely done, buttery uni and salty caviar elevating the flavour profile of the dish. Really worth trying once.
I can\'t offer much accurate review considering the fact that I\'ve never eaten beef prior (whoops) but I sure enjoyed this, though am not sure if I am willing to pay $98 for a bowl of food..... (thank you entertainer app)
A mochi whose texture defies what I was expecting. Plain on its own but taste enhance when coated with the accompanying roasted  soy bean flour :)
Amazingly  gorgeous and juicy wagyu! After tasting this, you will not want to eat other beef... \n<br />😂\n<br />http://slowchomp.com/fat-cow-camden-medical-centre-orchard/
The premium don ($98) at fat cow is one of those things that should always remain constant. Slices of chewy marbled Wagyu with slabs of buttery foie gras, that smear of uni before being topped with caviar and ikura. Weeeew. Thank goodness it\'s almost angpao season 😅
It\'s nearing the end year and we are trying to clear as many 1-for-1 deals in @entertainersg as possible. Hence, my annual affair at my favourite Japanese beef steak restaurant. I\'m still contemplating whether to  get next year\'s due to the increase in price and my budget.
😹\n<br />_\n<br />Extremely statisfying beef fix with this 45- day dry aged sirloin in Habayaki style $88, by grilling them with miso on a Japanese magnolia leaf. On the other hand, also had the glorious A4 ribeye $92 in shabu shabu style. Thanks to @entertainersg, the total bill did not break the bank. 🙊
The beef. \n<br />While we originally wanted to regret the ribeye from the tochigi prefecture, the staff regrettably informed us that it was out of stock, along with the miyazaki wagyu and the kobe beef. Undeterred, we had the A4 Ohmi Ribeye ($138 for 150g) from the shiga prefecture. \n<br />I peeked over the counter where the chef was deftly handling the meat. It was so heavily marbled, that it looked more like fat marbled with lean than the reverse. \n<br />Each cut of beef comes naked, both in seasoning and in presentation, the better to appreciate its handsome form.
Wagyu beef, ikura, foie gras, Uni, caviar and the onsen egg atop fluffy Japanese rice before being drizzled in their homemade soy. \n<br />I really enjoyed the foie gras. Offering absolutely no resistance, it melted like butter in the mouth. \n<br />The Wagyu beef was not the best but still really good, well charred but with a still center \n<br />Even though each component floored me at how delicious it was, what struck out to me was that nothing really outshined the other. Rather, everything combined into a ethereal symphony of flavours that left me wishing for more. \n<br />But eh, 98 dollars sia.
Tasty beef patty for him and Char grilled Wagyu beef Buri for me #beentheredonethat #Burpple #throwbackeats
This is their Donabemeshi ($78++) - claypot baked rice with charcoal grilled wagyu, finished off with their house made shoyu. Dang I can eat this all day.
Looking for a good bowl of Wagyu Beef Don?\n<br />Look no further because if you\'re not on a budget and are looking for something pretty damn good &amp; worth it, Fat Cow is your go to.
Fat Cow Donburi ($45++ set lunch) - slices of Wagyu with tender pink center &amp; a great outer sear. Onsen egg on point, &amp; even the rice is perfectly fluffy (if that\'s the word to describe NOT soggy/clumpy). I wonder if every dish here is perfect?
Set lunches come with a salad (great dressing &amp; fresh leafy greens), chawanmushi (orgasmic &amp; great ingredients) &amp; miso soup (alright).

A la carte menu: the donburi + Japanese wagyu are things I will be dreaming about for awhile 👅
For days when you are willing to pay a premium price for a good bowl of charcoal-grilled Wagyu don. Comes with a side of salad, miso soup and dessert to complete the meal with. 
First post on burpple! Went to Fat Cow for lunch, and the charcoal grilled wagyu don was indeed a $45++ well spent. Each beef slice laced with hint of truffled shoyu and the runny onsen egg on wagyu sauce drizzled rice was a perfect touch 💯 (lunch set came with crab meat chawanmushi, salad, miso soup and scoop of honeycomb ice cream) 
Fat Cow doesn\'t always serve their honeycomb ice cream as their lunch set dessert. But when they do, I know I\'m in for a treat! Simple pleasures..
I still prefer the standard Fat Cow wagyu don, but I love this too. The liver is fresher and has less acquired taste. $43++ during lunch.
Oh so good. It was $40 per set. And they charged for hot tea, lol. Come on, Koh Grill doesn\'t charge for hot tea. I am still forever curious why they have the restaurant located under a hospital, making me wander around for awhile before I found it. The atmosphere was awesome, the waiter was forever polite and was excited to explain to me about the wagyu beef grades. Apparently this is made from Australian wagyu cow which is a mix of wagyu and another breed, so it can\'t be counted for any grade. Nonetheless the meat was tasty...Mmm.. You can feel the smoky charcoal taste. I must add, the salad was incredible. They said the dressing was made with finely chopped onion, honey, apple (cider?), and a SECRET ingredient. How weird I couldn\'t detect the onion, even when I tried. The salad had very pure and light flavor and texture. Really good. The only thing was, why put me on the furthest corner of the square table just because I came alone? Not fair. 
Many may complain about the exorbitant price charged for this rice bowl, but personally, though I can\'t afford to eat this everyday or every alternate days, it\'s a don well spent. The smooth creamy texture of the foie gras will bring you to a seven heaven. Marination can be a bit overpowering for some people, but it goes very well with both foie gras and cubes of beef. Good thing is the ratio of ingredients to the rice is just nice. And to end the meal with honeycomb ice cream is indeed a perfection. (Set lunch comes with a bowl of miso soup, chawan mushi, salad and ice cream of the day)
Medium rare would be the most ideal way to go for this A3 grade charcoal-grilled wagyu that beautifully melts in your mouth together with truffle oil laced generously on each slice. Personally, it might not be the best wagyu/beef in my dictionary, but the slicing and grilling were indeed well-executed. Another good thing was the perfect ratio of rice to beef. The lunch set also comes with a small bowl of salad, miso soup, chawanmushi and a scoop of ice cream (we got the honeycomb). Another shout-out will go to their chawanmushi, personally one of the best I\'d ever tried so far: smooth silky custard (said to use organic New Zealand eggs) with chunks of crab meat, prawns and mushroom. 
Died and went to beefy heaven last night. Ohmi A4 ribeye and Iwate A5 ribeye - the marbling was gorgeous and they practically melted in our mouths. Super rich but also very delicate. Spent a bomb but at least we got 4 for 2 with the entertainer app 🙈
Fat Cow and their Donburi needs no introduction; a go-to spot when you ask anyone \"Where\'s the best Gyudon in town?\". Part of the set lunch menu, this comes complete with starters, the Don and dessert. The Don comes with charcoal-grilled Wagyu beef steak at your preferred doneness (we went for medium-rare) with egg, truffle shoyu sauce and yakiniku sauce. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and it was generous in portion with smoky flavour with a whiff of truffle, flanked with a runny egg that burst with a poke of the chopstick which can be mixed into the rice bowl. Rice was well-flavoured with sauce of a savoury flavour and light truffle aroma. Indeed one of the better dons I have had, and one that is definitely worth every single cent being paid and a must try for both Japanese Dons and steak lovers.
Till date, this is the most premium dish that I\'ve ever had! And so I\'ve heard about all that different grades of beef or how beautiful the marbling is - I finally get to translate all these into a real taste! Medium rare is definitely the way to go for this after trying my friend\'s medium. Grilled to a nice finish on the outer layer, the inner meat is still rare and tender. Upon my very first bite, it was so soft that I thought \"Is this even steak?!\" Indeed, the marbling of the beef which has the fats woven finely across the meat gives a smooth velvety texture. It was juicy and a delicate taste will linger on the palate. It might get slightly oily after awhile but to vary the taste, you can also dip it into the soy based sauce on the side that gives the meat a very nice savory finish. Definitely two thumbs up for this! #BestFoodMemory2015
Definitely more atas and fresher than the typical NTUC sashimi la. What I like is the salmon roe, which I ate together with the rice while popping the roes under my tongue to get the flavour all mixed together. 
Given the affordability of the set lunch, this is definitely one of the best deals around for wagyu beef don. The onsen egg was super oozy and the beef definitely did not disappoint. Not particularly a fan of chargrilled steak but this one was still really good as the char taste wasn\'t too overpowering 😊

This place is quite expensive, but it is really worth it. The texture of the wagyu is the best, and it comes with the set too! Worth to try! 
Shabu shabu is perfect for gloomy weather.\n<br />Here specially for the OHMI A5 wagyu beef.\n<br />Hearty.
coming back to fat cow regularly has always been a happy pill. the chefs sure knows how to make their way into consumers heart and stay there forever!!! 
Delicious mix of flavours. The charcoal grilled taste really makes it.
The foie gras goes pretty well with the rest of the dish. Mmm.
Irresistible. $39 for the Fat Cow Donburi lunch set that comes with salad, chawanmushi and dessert.
Tender beef slices with a hint of truffle 😍 Pity we couldn\'t enjoy our meal properly as the waitresses were eager to clear our table for the next group of guests :(
To all Fat Cow lovers I raise an early caution for this post as this might offend you but this is simply my two cents worth on my dining experience here.
Thick, tender, melt-in-your-mouth slices of charcoal-grilled Wagyu sit neatly fanned out on a bed of Japanese rice dashed with truffle oil and shoyu, accompanied by a perfect onsen tamago and shiro negi. The Fat Cow Donburi is no stranger to most, taking the spotlight on the restaurant\'s set lunch menu. Priced at $39, each bowl is served with salad, miso soup, chawanmushi and dessert. Portions aren\'t huge for its price tag, but when you see those glistening slices of wonderfully marbled Wagyu in front of you, dip them into the liquid golden yolk, and let its flavour dance on your tongue — you\'ll ache with satisfaction. 
Chirashi Zushi ($48)\n<br />Includes salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert.\n<br />Available at @FatCowSG
Yes, it\'s plain and it\'s $12. But somehow, FC was able to create a surprisingly nice salad from the simple combination. A good appetizer probably for ladies who needs greens in their meals
Amazing medium rare truffle wagyu beef w onsen egg that oozes perfectly $39++ &amp; foie gras w charcoal grilled beef $43++ - fat cow\'s lunch set menu. Remember to book in advance! 👌🏼😘 
Of course we couldn\'t go to Fat Cow and not have any... cow. We had its infamous Fat Cow Donburi set lunch ($39++) - slices of charcoal-grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg and shiro negi.
Sashimi Moriawase - chef\'s selection of 13 pieces of premium sashimi.
Very generous with their portion of foie gras and the beef was tender. Would be even better if it comes with the onsen egg in this bowl.
which is charcoal-grilled wagyu beef w onsen egg haha OMGAWD JUST CHECK OUT ALL THAT CRAZY MARBLING IN THOSE SLICES OF GOODNESS 😍😍😍 I\'ll have my beef at nothing else but medium rare baby 😘 #burpple
you can really see the bright pink colour and the marbling of the beef when it was served. so fatty, and the sides were sear nicely. so juicy and tender, the taste lingers for quite some time. \n<br />thanks to entertainer app for the great savings! 2 steaks for the price of 1 😬
knowing how the koreans love their beefs, figured fat cow is THE most befitting place to talk shop over dinner at one of our island\'s best beef game. innocent namesake enough but fat cow is definitely upscale and dine to impress. my 180g medium rare wagyu flatiron ($58) from down under, while a tad shy of other premium japanese A4 or A5 cuts the restaurant has to offer, was already insanely orgasmic good. first mouth and i was blown away - that alluring pink hue and that perfectly executed grilled smokiness that made the already very flavorful cut even more pronounced. dont belittle that diced tomato by the side, is equally charmingly marinated sweet and resets my whole palette in anticipation for the next heavenly slice. that ponzu ginger sesame dip? o fat cow, you really don\'t have to.
Fat Cow boasts cuts from several parts of Japan, Australia and the US, and what you should really go for is the Japanese Wagyu, which they offer in grades A3, A4 and A5. Depending on your preference, you can choose how you want your steak to be cooked: shabu shabu, sukiyaki, charcoal grilled or teppanyaki. Go for charcoal grilled; they do a nice, smoky sear on the outside while leaving the centre pink, so that you get to enjoy the marbling of the beef. For a more pocket-friendly option, their lunch sets are priced from $26 (includes salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert) with the Fat Cow Donburi ($39, charcoal grilled Wagyu beef, onsen egg and white leek) winning the votes of many. 
😋 This 💣 comprises of fat, rich, &amp; buttery glazed foie gras w grilled wagyu cubes. When I was eating the foie gras &amp; wagyu cubes together... it was like a party in my mouth! 😎🎉
Priced at ~$50 for set lunch, this donburi had a generous serving of sliced wagyu beef which was tender and tasty. What really blew my mind was the onsen egg which was perfectly cooked. The chawamushi was unlike any other. Really worth a try despite the price. 
When people talk about value-for-money lunch sets, Fat Cow would definitely be mentioned. The ingredients taste and look extremely fresh and the flavours are just astounding.
This was amazing. If you feel like celebrating/splurging on food, this is where you should go!
Medium Rare with the perfect egg! Can\'t rave more about this item. 
Fat Cow has long been one of the must-tries on my list, so when I found out that it was one of the participating restaurants on $100Gourmet, I camped on the site like a trader on the stock market, and forced fellow Burppler @iamjaynedoe to follow suit.
This steak is from the Ohmi perfecture, second highest grade of beef. It is divine. Though quite expensive at $238 for 300gms, it is so fat and sinful that you will need a partner to finish all of it for you. Eat it with their assortment of sides that range from $15-20. I had Kinoko which was mushroom with butter, lemon and sake. 
the wagyu is freshly grilled and you can smell the charcoal from inside of the wagyu. Along with the fragrance of the rice, it makes the perfect set!
Charcoal grilled beef with their slurpilicious onsen egg. Set comes with salad, seafood Chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert. Pretty pricy and not overly impressed, more impressed with the seafood Chawanmushi though :)
This aint too shaby either! The raw sashimi were fresh and even cut to smaller bite sized pieces you could even see the fat streaks on it! So good!
This was my love for the afternoon 😍
I had a beef-tastic lunch date today! I\'m still thinking about it now. Set lunch was at $39++ for the donburi which comes with appetizer: chawamushi, salad, miso soup and dessert. I\'ll say it\'s really worth it and good quality beef. I\'m gg back for you fat cowwwwww! #BestFoodMemory2015
Fat Cow serves luxurious meats &amp; is known for their various grades wagyu beef. You can choose your meat to be cooked in different styles: Sumibiyaki, Sukiyaki and Shabu Shabu. Great place for dining on yr special occasion. 🍷 Big thanks to @the_entertainer241, we had a 1-for-1 main course which saves us 80 bucks. 👍 More info of this hidden gem on the blog, jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg (link in bio)
MUCH less veiny cut this time. And more rice. Set lunches come with miso soup, salad, chawanmushi and a scoop of honeycomb ice cream. 
Juicy melt in your mouth ribeye. The japanese sauce is a bit sweet salty citrusy, i prefer just the steak by itself. Medium rare. Enjoyed with sake. Delicious!
Nothing beats simple minimalist cooked good quality beef , rare, very good! 
Hand-cut small cubes wagyu beef tartare with white miso salted plum and sweet potato. Not as special as i expected.
Sliced bream with black truffle slices and seasoned kelp. Recommended by the server and i thanked him for that. Orgasmic! 
Melt in your mouth madness, who else is a fan of wagyu? Which is your favorite prefecture?
Arguably the world\'s tastiest prawn and id have to say it was a life changing prawn experience. This one prawn costs $25.
Tastes amazing with the lime and sea salt which breaks down the buttery fat for a soft texture.
Simply seared till medium rare and seasoned with salt. No trace of foul aftertaste and their fat just melted in my mouth. \n<br />For 150g at S$120, we ordered the best of the best. Thanks to #entertainerapp, we got one for one main offer. \n<br />For those who are interested, I recommend their set lunch, Butchery Special Cut or Fat Cow Donburi.

It was thinner than the rest but made it much easier to eat.
The savory soy sauce balanced the dish and made it so easy to eat. \n<br />4 piece of sweet potato costed S$14! Stunning expensive!
(S$12)
Got swayed over by the fat foa-gura don; each mouthful of that foie gras and marbled wagyu steak cubes is so rich and buttery, it almost feels like ascending to heaven and back. Or maybe that\'s just angina talking. The salted caramel ice cream was equally delightful and one of the creamiest. Coming back for more.. After I\'ve burnt it all. #sanctuary #serendipity #addictions #burpple
Sukiyaki Grade A3 Sirloin [$79] and Blackmore Ranch [$85] for the price for one! Thankful for the mini surprise by the staff at Fat Cow! 
They are known for their various grades of Japanese wagyu beef. Totally blown away when it melts in your mouth. Here\'s The Fat Cow Beef Donburi, charcoal grilled wagyu w onsen egg. Only available for set lunch, $39. Thanks to #theentertainerapp, we also had Sukiyaki Grade A3 Sirloin $79 &amp; Blackmore Ranch $85 for the price of one! 👍 @the_entertainer241 \n<br />Great thanks to the staff at @fatcowsg for the great service and birthday surprise for @nkikichua ☺️
Creamiest, richest chawanmushi ever, freshest salad, all round damn solid set lunch for $50 nett. Parking is $6/hr though :(
I don\'t think anything can beat this combination and this bowl. 💯💯💯
Fat Cow is perhaps most famous for it\'s Fat Cow Donburi set lunch, with images of the donburi flooding social media platforms. Priced at $38+++, I feel that the set lunch is incredibly worth it! Before you tuck into the marvellous donburi, you are served with a salad, miso soup and chawanmushi with shredded crabmeat and scallop.The appetizers are swiftly cleared away by attentive staff members and before you know it, the star of the show is placed right in front of you. It\'s funny how I rotated the bowl to view the dish from another angle and the staff member came to adjust it back to it\'s original position (see picture). So what is The Fat Cow Donburi? It\'s a bowl of short-grain Japanese rice cooked to perfect plumpness, topped with thick slices of medium-rare wagyu beef(you decide how you want it done), thinly chopped shiro negi and a perfectly done onsen tamago. A dash of truffle oil and shoyu is added to the rice as well. Burst the gorgeous yolk of the onsen tamago and mix it all up, leaving you with a golden glistening donburi. Each bite is simply bliss. But unfortunately, all delicious things come to an end a little too quickly. I felt that the donburi\'s portion was a little small but that might just be me wanting a limitless supply of the donburi. There\'s also the argument that good things come in small packages. Anyway, the set lunch finally ended with a dessert and what I was served that day was a scoop of ice cream, made in-house. As the dessert\'s name was not reflected on the menu, I can only guess that it was passionfruit and yuzu flavoured. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful way to end the meal. I\'ll be back for more once I\'m done with my diet! 
Love at first bite with Fat Cow Donburi! I opted for just the beef, without the foiegras. This lunch set ($49) came with a walnut salad and strawberry ice cream for dessert. Yum! Love how fragrant the rice was and how well everything came together in a dish.
Wagyu, poached egg and truffle bits. Sensational taste of yolk drenched rice with hints of truffle, accompanying the tender slices of beef.
Ugh, so good. 
This arrived at the table in a halo of truffle-y fragrance, the charcoal-grilled wagyu beef immaculately cooked to a tender, juicy medium doneness - pure heaven dipping the slices in the molten yolk of the accompanying onsen egg.

\"Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Beef and Onsen Egg\". Doesn\'t reading that alone make your mouth water? The good news: it\'s as delicious as it sounds. The sliced Wagyu is fragrant and tender, while the onsen egg is wobbly perfection (making it a great dip for the beef!). The bad news: there\'s just too little of it! As expensive as Wagyu Beef is, I do think the portion for this Set Lunch item can be slightly bigger for the $38++ price tag. \n
Cubed assorted sashimi over rice. Beautiful presentation and sashimi was fresh. However, it was still on the pricey side compared to other chirashis.
Chef\'s choice of day\'s finest seafood over mixed sushi rice. Slices were a bit thinner here and the rice bowl wasn\'t that worth the money.
Charcoal grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg and shiro negi. Finally got to eating it after seeing it on @serenechai feed some time back. Awesome stuff! Although you can\'t see the onsen egg from here but it was perfect!
omg I\'m a sucker for this. part of the lunch set. 
still can\'t decide if I love or hate this. the wagyu is unfortunately an inferior cut (tough and veiny despite bring done med rare as requested), but the onsen egg and truffle (oil?) had me practically licking the bowl. NOT recommended for big eaters as the portion of rice is tiny.

Cubes of grilled beef and buttery foie gras covered in a sweet and savoury sauce on rice. Decadent bowl of goodness. 
Medium rare wagyu beef done perfectly with a lovely char-grilled taste, paired with a soft runny yolk set on a bed of rice and finished with a touch of truffle oil. Perfection in a bowl.
Grilled wagyu beef, onsen egg and a generous portion of glazed foie gras over rice... Absolutely divine! More on the blog (link in profile)! 
Charcoal-grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg &amp; shiro negi. Perfectly cooked wagyu which is lightly seasoned, could absolutely taste the freshness of the meat in my mouth. My all time favourite place for wagyu beef😋
The picture speaks for itself: Medium rare wagyu strips &amp; onsen-cooked egg on top of a bed of fragrantly cooked Japanese rice. Need I say more :p
Cannot believe this set is only $38 w chawanmushi &amp; salad. Will definitely come back for more!!
 Just like its interior, the beef adopts a basic and minimalistic Japanese cooking technique that bring out the best of the meat’s natural flavours.here\'s a photo of charcoal grilled zabuton cut of American wagyu beef.

Wagyu saga beef grade A5 ($95 for 100g) Beef can be cooked in four different styles: teppankayi, robatayak, sukiyaki and shabu shabu. 
Seared on the grill to perfection, I suggest you take your time to savour every single slice of this flavour-packed steak. 
Sweet, juicy discs of momotaro with a side of pressed baby spinach in creamy sesame sauce. So glad to be back! 
It\'s a sampling of their most popular dishes. My favourites are the Fat Cow a grilled American Wagyu beef, the salad momotaro tomatoes and the dessert honey comb ice cream with their home made mochi. Great meal!
One for one with @entertainersg and even though it was still pretty pricey ($178 total 😭😭😭💸💸💸), it was worth every penny! I don’t like fatty beef but this one really just melts in your mouth and doesn’t make you feel jelak. Definitely a must-try at least once!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodporn #foodblog #foodlover #foodstagram #mouthwatering #steakhouse #steak #fatcow #entertainersg #savewithasmile #instafood #sgfoodie #igsg #sgfoodblog #foodiegram #instasg #tslmakan #8dayseat #STfoodtrending #iweeklyfood #instadaily #igers #whati8today #burpple #EATPL

Their set lunches include, Salad, Chawanmushi, Miso Soup, Main, Dessert and ranges from SGD 30-50++. My personal favourite is their Fat Foa-Gura Don! It has the best of both world, Glazed Foie Gras and Wagyu cubes! I’m totally in love with their flavorful, soft glazed Foie Gras!! Bite-size Wagyu cubes is da bomb too! Mouth-watering Wagyu cubes is cooked with the perfect doneness(not too overcooked and not too rare), tender and yet not too toughy! AWESOME! @fatcowsg #hungryunicornsg #fatcowsg #fatcow #fatcowdonburi #foiegras #wagyubeef

Start your weekend early by indulging in good quality food! Fat Cow Beef &amp; Set Lunches are our Favourite! ❤️ They have 11 Set Lunches to choose from and cost $38++ to $50++. All consists of Salad, Chawamushi, Miso Soup &amp; Dessert! This bowl that I had is our all time Favourite \"Fat Foa-Gura Don\" which has glazed Foie gras and wagyu cubes over rice! We love it a medium rare so this is it! Superr Super awesomeeeee!!! Foie gras just melts in your mouth, beef is so soft and texture and doneness just nice. PERFECT! Set Lunches are available even on weekend but do make your reservation early as seats can be taken up pretty fast! Definitely the best place for quality and good beef! @fatcowsg #fatcow #fatcowdonburi #fatfoaguradon #foiegras #foiegraswagyudon #wagyu #donburi
Filled with soooo much UMAMI. Uni, caviar, foie gras &amp; Wagyu beef... all the good stuff! And the price?? $98++! 😱 / MY VERDICT? \n<br />Taste: 3/5 \n<br />Definitely not worth over a hundred bucks! Pretty to look at but quality is questionable hmm... Beef was very chewy and the rice did not have any seasoning! Portion for the uni is really small too 😕
I need to head there soon!

2 slabs of half cut 150g Tochigi Grade A5 wagyu ribeye ($158++ each) and wagyu donburi ($45++). Australian striploin was used for the donburi and it\'s quite a steal for lunch, almost half price but a far cry from the japanese wagyu. Disappointed with the wagyu too as it lacks the \'melt in the mouth\' texture.  #tgif #fridaycheatday #singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #burpple #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #sgrestaurant #brunch #onthetable #sgeats #8dayseat #sgbrunch #beef #steak #japanese #wagyu #photography #donburi

FatCow - A Japanese Steakhouse that Specialise in serving Wagyu 和牛, Wagyu refers to all Japanese Beef Cattle, \'Wa\' means Japanese &amp; \'Gyu\' means Cow. 🐮\n<br />.\n<br />This is a Half Cut (110g) Grade A3 Tenderloin from Saga Prefecture, Japan (💵S$89)/Full Cut (220g/💵S$178) Wagyu are generally known for their Intense Marbling &amp; High Unsaturated Fat Content which literally Melts once it enters your mouth thus the High Price. 😳 Some of the Best Wagyu Beef comes from Matsusaka, Kobe &amp; Ōmi Prefecture. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Start with Tai No Kuro-Toryufu - Sliced Sea Bream with Black Truffle (💵S$38) then move on to the Main Event - Wagyu Beef. Spare no expense, go all out &amp; order the Full Cut (300g) Grade A5 Ribeye from Iwate Prefecture (💵S$288) Eat first then think about the Bill later. 😅
They served good quality beef! We had Donabemeshi @fatcowsg @phusionade #bestbeef #fatcow #fatcowsg #throwbackthursday #donabemeshi
The cubes of Wagyu beef were grilled to perfection just like I asked, medium rare,and the foie gras... fatty and rich. #fatcow #yummy #onmytable #sharefood #topcitybites #exploresingapore #tslmakan #delicious #beautifulcuisines #burpple
Delicious but massively overpriced and rather dead ambience for a Saturday night. Even the side dishes of sweet potato was $15 for 4 thin slices, seriously! Even with the entertainer 1-for-1 offer, I wouldn\'t go back. You\'ll get more value elsewhere for sure.

A top grade wagyu beef that is juicy and the surface of the meat is nicely grilled to char.
Thankful to be able to eat again!
I\'ll still be dreaming of this tonight I\'m sure! #burrple
Signature dish of this restaurant and probably what drew us back to Fat Cow. Since the beef is grilled over charcoal, it has that smoked taste, which along with the lingering aroma of the truffle oil, makes a perfect combination. Onsen egg was on point too 💯. Amazingly, the 锅巴 is made crispy enough to be eaten without it sticking to your teeth, something I enjoy. Will we come back again? Hell yes!
Absolutely unforgettable
So so so good!
$39++ 
Really mmmm with every mouth
Pretty good, but way too expensive at $12++
Every mouth was delightful 😊
$120 for 150gm. 😘✨👌 Fullcut will be perfect! #pearlspectives
Charcoal grilled wagyu😌
Grilled on bamboo leaf, the cod leaves a lingering sweetness. 
FC names them \"tastiest prawn in the world\". $25 per pc, $65 for 3. Don\'t expect jumbo prawns, they are of a decent size n yes, fresh prawns only needs to be perfectly grilled, n top it w some salt. 
Finally got to try you!! #fatcow #sgfood #whati8today #burpple
Frickin\' orgasmic! 😋
Best way to eat - stir the egg yolk w the rice &amp; have it together w a piece of tender beef 👍 Oishiiineh!
Sinful, heart stopping but tastes too good to be missed. 
It\'s simply the bomb! This needs no filter and definitely needs a second visit for their lunch set menu!

Love it when the egg oozes out and how all the elements come together in a bowl!

Sauce was a little salty but the daikon and tendon was so soft and easy to chew. Foie gras... Was just being itself. Awesome! 
Tantalizing, heart-wrecking Foie Gras in chunks. O-M-G.
Two! Food here is SO GOOD.

Defo not enough for me, very yummy. Pricey place though.
