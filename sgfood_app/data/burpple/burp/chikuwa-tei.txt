However, fret not! The signature thick fresh sashimi in their Chirashi Don are still available! Prices remain pocket friendly with the basic Chirashi at $25! \n<br />Decided to treat myself to the Chirashi Kou ($35) - almost the same as the basic one but with slightly more premium ingredients such as Hotate, Chutoro, Unagi and Amaebi from Tsukiji Fish Market!
All uni-d is love (and food). Featuring Chikuwa Tei\'s chawanmushi ($5 for regular, $8 with ikura and $12 with uni). The steamed egg is silky smooth while each spoonful reveals more ingredients such as prawns and ginkgo nuts.
I heard this is the best... And I concur the  comment!!! 
Don\'t know if I\'ve been spoilt by other super fresh (and more expensive) chirashi dons. This just didn\'t feel as shiok. The swordfish was too hard, and the tuna was a little hard as well. But I must say, this is still the most value for money at $25.
Star of the night!!! Sashimi was so fresh and sliced so thickly. For just $25++ it\'s really value for money since they don\'t skimp on the portions either. It\'s no wonder this place is so popular even on a weekday night!
I\'m a huge fan of sashimi and chirashi don. This particular one was pretty great, I enjoyed how the fish was fresh and the slices were thick, making it an experience in itself. The unity between the fish and the rice could have been better and I prefer the Sushi Bar\'s chirashi for that, but this is definitely worth a try!
Old school Japanese restaurant vibes, friendly sincere restaurant which kept urging me \"Go try out other restaurant yah?\" Realised that the slices are slightly thinner than its sister restaurant. Vibes are similar though. \n<br />Something is lacking in this bowl, though I can\'t quite pinpoint what.
It\'s the best chirashi don I ever had in Singapore . The fish was fresh as if it was just alive a few moments ago before I eat it . The portion was generous and the service was good. We almost ordered the same kind of sashimi that was already in the chirashi don but luckily the waitress reminded us.  Their another side dish which is ikura oroshi is also superb and underrated . Who could have thought the mix of yam paste and ikura would be so refreshing. Yummy! Would def go back when I m craving for Japanese food! 
Chikuwa Tei, formally under Yoi Group Organization. A small humble restaurant situated at 9 Mohamed Sultan Road opened by the Former Chef of Wasabi Tei at Far East Plaza. With a selection of 18 bentos on the menu at an affordable price ranging from $12 for Mackerel set to a more popular option would be their Chirashi Sushi set at $25.
Nothing beats Shinji really, but on days when pockets aren\'t feeling deep, I\'d be more than happy to have this awesome bowl of freshness 4/5 
Generous portion of thickly sliced sashimi, good and fresh. Very down to earth restaurant, nothing fancy. May be back if in the vicinity and craving sashimi. 
Oyaku don that came with pickles, miso soup and fruits. Added on my favourite Chawanmushi for $5++
Look at that fresh thick slices of sashimi
Fresh &amp; thick slices of sashimi on top of the sticky rice. #yummy
S$21++ I must say better than Sushi Bar FEP. Request for less tuna and more salmon or swordfish!
Always leaving this place satisfied. Incredible bargain price set lunches and great tasting fresh fish flown in regularly! They prepare their sashimi and sushi really well and their Unagi is the bomb! They also know how to grill their fish to perfection! Gindara, soft tender melt in your mouth center  w a beautiful crisp caramelized outer. Their menu is extensive w so much to offer. 
Freshly made from the sushi bar, only the waiting time is too long , you are drooling as your companions are enjoy their meal. May be it was too crowd for that special Mother\'s Day. 
Brought my mum to chikuwa tei to celebrate Mother\'s Day! For the first time, there\'s more seniors than hipsters/ PMEBs in this very popular place. Mum loved the food!
Simply the best chirashi don in singapore!
This could fight the sushi bar\'s. On par. 
A respectable Japanese steamed egg littered over the top with shimeji mushrooms, and a little shrimp casually hooked over the edge of the cup. 
Seasonal item that is fresh and sweet. Open only upon order. We had it at a promotional price of S$40 a piece. It was worth every slice on it\'s pretty shell. 
Just can\'t get enough of this whole bowl of fresh goodness. Each slice is thick and firm, with a hint of fresh sweet sea taste. You know it\'s that good when you taste the ocean. || Price: S$65++ (set meal with appetizer, soup, fruits and dessert) 
Perhaps I\'d been so spoilt by the perfectly seasoned rice and sashimi at Sushi Dai at Tsukiji Market, Tokyo, that it\'s hard to find satisfaction in the sashimi here. Or perhaps it\'s the overhyped reputation of this restaurant that led to my overall disappointment in this lacklustre rice bowl, which had albeit thick cuts of tamago yaki, salmon, tuna, swordfish, yellowtail and ikura.
Went to a new jap place again! Saw youngsters and even elders patronizing, seems like it caters to all walks of life :) My sushi was yaaaaaammmmieeee! 
Served with generous slabs of sashimi, it tastes really fresh and good value for money. If you\'re looking for an environment that you can enjoy good chirashi and hang out with friends, this place is it. If your sole purpose is to eat and be impressed, The Sushi Bar is still the choice.
Yesterday\'s lunch date with @jolningy!! Freshest sashimi I\'ve had to date!! üò±üòç
The food and menu prices at Chikuwa Tei was really a bargain considering what you would have to pay at other places for this caliber of food. The portion of the Chirashi is more than enough for one person. The queue can be an issue, unless you make a reservation.  
It\'s small eggs meet big eggs again! Love Ikura!

Just look at oh so thick and succulent sashimi and the big and juicy roe.
the first dish that reeled me into the incredible word of #japanese cuisine #cantgowrongwiththis 
The sashimi were sloggy and didn\'t have the crunchy feel. Definitely, will not go back for more..
The fresh &amp; tasty sashimi made me a happy girl!\n<br />.\n<br />#xtieinsg #home #whati8today #cafehop #cafehopsg #cafelife #igsg #foodie #foodstyling  #foodspotting #foodfeed #hungrygowhere #burpple #foodspottingsg #burpplesg #timeoutsg #chirashi #chirashidon
At 35 dollars, there are definitely cheaper sushi bowls around but this was really happiness with every spoonful.
