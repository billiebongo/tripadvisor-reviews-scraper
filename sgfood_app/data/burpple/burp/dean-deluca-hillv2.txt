hillv2, the chichi place to go in panjang of late with dean and deluca. while i have not much comments for the quiche, eggs iberico here is OMG. this is eggs benedict elevated with luxe jamÃ³n ibÃ©ric (cured ham from Spain) with hollandaise sauce on sundried tomato bread. lovely earthy salty from marbled red ham and tangy hollandaise sauce all mixed up divinely with the warm runny egg. how can this ever go wrong.
Eggs iberico taste was good. Enjoyed the sweet pumpernickel, and the way it complements the hollandaise sauce and savory ham. Pouched eggs however were not well done. It was almost like hard boiled egg. Banana salted caramel and French toasted brioche was cooked to soft perfection, the salted caramelised bananas â€“ a scrumptious marriage of smoky salted caramel flavour with sweet, tender banana. Good!!! Lastly the American country breakfast was excellent too! Price range $18-$22
Its meant for 2 to share !! The cream on top is yum , lol. The pan cake is average . cinnamon maple syrup is unique , I believe it will go well with ice cream :)
Always liked the rainbow cake of Dean &amp; Deluca cause theirs are one of the few that I can tasted the different flavors of each layers. But today\'s one are rather hard and dried. Maybe due to being in the refrigerator for too long? \n<br />#burpple #deananddeluca #deananddelucahillv2 #rainbowcake #hillview #hillv2 #cafesg
The sauce for this salad can be better. But the very nice thing is that they served it piping hot and this is good cause the air on is really strong here! \n<br />#burpple #deananddeluca #deananddelucahillv2 #mushroom #wildmushroomragout #cafesg

American Country Breakfast ($23). Warning: Do not underestimate this serving! ðŸ˜‚
Ignore the naggings from your jiggly thighs and just indulge in the experience. I guarantee you that this $3.60 treat is well worth the extra mileage laterã€‚
Luvvit ^_^
Not the best pancakes, but not too shabby either. Unsure whether it is, but the pancakes\' texture feel like they\'re processed. A little dry and hard. The cream topping however is fresh and real tasty. Not overly tasty as with most creams slathered over pancakes (or waffles for that matter).
Heapful of bananas and fruits! The toasts are nice without being too oily only thing need to improve is the ice cream.\n<br />#burpple #deananddeluca #deananddelucahillv2 #briochefrenchtoast #cafesg #hillview #hillv2
The eggs are slightly too well done and salmon too salty but the sauce is rather nice. \n<br />#burpple #deananddeluca #deananddelucahillv2 #cafesg #hillview #hillv2 #eggbenedicts #salmonbenedict
