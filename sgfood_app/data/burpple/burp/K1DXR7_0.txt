Another weekend of fooding with @dacookieman and @joshua_ng. What are we having next time? üòÅ
Cold weather food, though I think the quality was better when they were at Henderson Rd :/ #teochewporridge\n<br />#porridge #economyrice #mixedrice #rice #yeshanghai $20 for 3 pax

Finally check out this Taxi uncle haunt and love every dish I order. Plus, it\'s super cheap! üòã
Opens from 10.30am to 5am all days of the week except Tuesday, Ye Shang Hai is a popular supper hideout for many night owls and a value-for-money dining place for the office lunch crowd. You will always see the stall filled with trays and trays of food because the cooks in the kitchen just keep whipping out yummy-looking dishes!
No prizes for guessing what one of my lifestyle consists of though.

Possibly the cheapest teo chew muay in town. #foodporn #burpple #yeshanghaiteochewporridge #Â§ú‰∏äÊµ∑ÊΩÆÂ∑ûÁ≤•
Teochew porridge $35
This is called a three special Teh c. So basically I guess why it\'s called that because there are 3 layers of colours but you can\'t really tell in the picture. Not that great though, it\'s just syrup at the bottom and teh!!
$20 for 2 pax. #Êª°Êª°‰∏ÄÊ°å
All these for less than $25!
Our total share is $20. Coffeeshop has revamped, brightly lit &amp; currently under ÈáëÂ±±Â≤≠. There are new tenants too.
#shiok @plackbosies @calvinwj @leannchng
The long beans with chilli minced meat and the saut√©ed potatoes with onions are cooked towards my liking. However food is average overall. Pricing is quite reasonable at $8 for 5 dishes &amp; 2 bowls of porridge which, might the long queue.
The forever long queue teochew porridge
