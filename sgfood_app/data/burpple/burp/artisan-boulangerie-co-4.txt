😊 Mid week already! Home running to the weekend from here. Weeks have been waytoo busy. But looking forward to #CoffeeAndCravings BBQ this Saturday and sleeping in 😴 #coffee #latte #latteart #ABCsingapore
#latte for @pigg0ink . So glad to be able to see Kae again!! 😘
We got to try ABC\'s Freshly Baked Foccacias as part of our starters during our Coffee &amp; Cravings meetup last week. I personally liked the cheese and chunks of fresh mushrooms, sundried tomatoes &amp; eggplants as part of the toppings. Craving for the baked cheesy bits just writing about it &gt;.
One of the new Lava Cake flavours at ABC (๑´ڡ`๑) 
Soft fluffy croissant pastry filled with salmon goodness. Everyone loved these mini croissants from ABC\'s platters menu~
This tart certainly satisfies the sweet tooth in me. At first glance I was a little hesitant to choose it because I thought it was one of those tarts that have the super unbreakable shell and filling. However, to my surprise, the shell holds together nicely when being sliced and crumbles apart in the mouth. The caramel is just nice (not too sweet) and has a smooth texture.
Had the opportunity to try the Salmon &amp; Dill Quiche from Artisan Boulangerie Co. last night for dinner. Served with a refreshing side of salad, the quiche is  a creamy and flavourful savoury treat. The salmon goes well with the cheesey, creamy filling. Definiately a must try for cheese lovers! #CoffeeAndCravings
In a red cup. Maybe I\'ll get a flat red next time
Same coffee and desserts, but different consistency from the new outlet at Asia Square Tower 2.

avocado in ma belleh. ma belleh is very happeh 🤗
Crunchiness of the sweetened granola complements the natural sourness of the yogurt. Topping it with fruit gives it a dash of colour and flavour! #granola #honeysweetened #yogurt #berries #fruit #breakfast #closetnomster #ieatthereforeiam #jemangeddoncjesuis #eatclean #fresh #burpple @artisanboulangerie
