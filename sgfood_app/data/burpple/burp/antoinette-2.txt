A moon cake inspired flavour? 🤔 Perfect for the upcoming moon cake festival indeed! (If mooncakes aren\'t your kind of thing) Would have been great if the salted egg cremeux was more flowy but nevertheless, its distinctive flavour and pleasant lingering saltiness deserves a thumbs up!  Adorned with a ring of white lotus seed mousse which was soft, light, its pleasant tinge of sweetness was an ideal companion and counterbalance to the saltiness of the salted egg cremeux. The coconut cake was spongy with a cotton-like softness, though not a significant contribution to the flavours. What I fancied most here is the base of salted sesame peanut praline that was crispy, with a subtle roasted flavour and mild lingering pleasant salty aftertaste 😋 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />. \n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
What I fancied most about this dish was the cheesy  surprise within each arancini balls, apart from the tangy and flavourful chilli crab sauce. Each arancini was done to perfection, with a crisp and well breaded panko-crusted golden brown exterior, encasing a compact clump of rice grains and a thick, gooey melted cheesy core 😋. The chilli crab sauce makes a great companion, with a tangy spiciness and a slightly thick texture which surprisingly did not impart any significant sogginess to the arancini.  Not for the faint hearted as the spiciness was a significant contribution to the flavours and packs a punch! Along with crisp deep fried mantou (tasted like crackers to me), this might be an appetizer meant for sharing but I would gladly love to have it as a main instead! 💖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice

Chef Pang’s rendition of Chicken Rice - In order to soak up the flavour of the chicken, chef pang has cleverly replaced the fragrant rice with wholesome barley. The iconic dish sees luxuriously juicy chunks of sous vide chicken atop the barley mash, garnished with sinfully crispy baked chicken skin. 
But this dessert was nothing monotonous as its colour looked. \n<br />With Lapsang souchong tea ganche mousse, mandarin orange confit, caramelised hazelnut feuilletine on cocoa sponge and dulcey Chantilly cream, it tasted of a soothing tea fragrance. Made like pebbles and twigs, it undoubtedly reminded us of a Zen Garden as its name suggested. A beautiful creation from Chef Pang\'s recent new range.
Was soft, fluffy and beautifully baked with toasted coconut topping. Was good that the subtle doses of Gula Melaka kept the cake light on taste. Good for a light tea break treat.
Happy National Day to all my friends. 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬 Antoinette at Penhas @antoinette_sg has introduced NEW dishes with a Singapore spin.
chicken rice. Fret not! Antoinette has reinterpreted one of Singapore\'s favourite dishes; CHICKEN RICE. The rice is replaced with healthy barley grains and is soaked in the goodness of chicken stock. The \"unknown\" chicken meat is so tender👍🏻. And I got a shock to know that it is chicken breast after the meal. The chicken breast is prepared in sous-vide style 😋. The dipping; scallion, ginger dressing, chilli gel and dark soya sauce foam are presented in little bubbles.\n<br />.\n<br />Chicken rice at S$26.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @_boyz86 for the invitation\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine? \n<br />Antoinette\n<br />30 Penhas Rd, 208188\n<br />.\n<br />#antoinette_sg #chickenrice #foodgemsg
The Orient is the chef\'s modern take on a moon cake - salted egg crémeux,  lotus seed mousse,  coconut cake - with a layer of salted peanut sesame praline.
Never tried the Castella cake shop based in tampines (because of the crowd) but surely love this one. Fluffy, not dry at all, and smells really nice (my colleagues can smell it when i get the cake out from the box). As it is so fluffy and not sweet, i feel like i can finish half of the cake at one shot!
Love how crispy the croissant is. Was expecting more salted egg lava in the croissant though.
@Antoinette_sg TOPS THE CASTELLA CAKE competition with their unique flavors like:\n<br />Nutella ($13), Ondeh ondeh ($11), Earl Grey ($12), Earl Grey Cheese ($15), Vanilla Cheese ($11) and of course, the usual Vanilla ($8)! While the Vanilla tended towards the sweeter side, it was still super fragrant and fluffy! My personal favorites has got to be the Earl Grey Cheese (to my surprise, loved the sweet savory combo) and ondeh ondeh!
Not entirely persuaded by the union between earl grey and cheese, which fit as comfortably as an army helmet on a baby quokka, but the Kleenex-softness of the castella cakes in general would be sure to satisfy trendy Mei Meis and toothless Ah Mas alike.
#AntoinetteSG\'s Chef Pang has prepared a flowy, oozy creation that\'ll have fans of mooncakes or their salted egg croissant flocking. \'The Orient\' (whole $45, small $9) of smooth white lotus seed mousse is made rich with dollops of their signature salted egg yolk filling, then balanced with a brittle salted peanut-sesame feuilletine. #MediaTasting
This is #AntoinetteSG Chef Pang\'s #Easter twist on Snickers and PB&amp;J, also two of my fav treats. The white chocolate stem breaks to reveal dark chocolate mousse, chocolate ganache, caramel peanut and raspberry marmalade; and the cap, a fluffy, Mario-red marshmallow-meringue crown. #MediaTasting PS. Their pretty iced teas are great too.
This ham &amp; cheese French toast from the dessert master was a satisfying treat. \n<br />With Swiss Gruyere cheese cream and Paris ham, they already sounded impressed. Topped with tasty maple sauce and that fragrant Chantilly cream, savoury and sweet never tasted that good. It was amazing how such a simple dish tasted so extraordinary.
Celebrated a lonesome Valentine’s splurging on Antoinette’s special La Rose ($12.00) posed in delicate dark chocolate chantilly petals with grand cru chocolate mousse layered with exotic caramel, crunchy almond nougatine and moist cocoa sponge soaked in grand mariner. My type of rose.
Signature Country Style Mushroom Soup with toasted country bread ($13) 👍🏻Rich &amp; Flavourful\n<br />.\n<br />Savory Blinis with Sautéed Creamy Mushrooms, Grilled Bacon, Tomato and Salad ($18) 👍🏻Very fluffy pancakes &amp; surprisingly good when served as a savory\n<br />.\n<br />Seafood Alio Olio ($26) 👍🏻Tasty pasta in white wine sauce with fresh scallops, squids, prawns and mussels\n<br />.\n<br />Crab Pomodoro ($26) 👌🏻Slightly spicy for me but delighted by the generous crab meat soaked in the clam broth\n<br />.\n<br />Boeuf Bourguigon ($36) 👎🏻Sadly the braised wagyu brisket in red wine was not to my liking as the beef was not fantastic &amp; the sauce was not tasty\n<br />.\n<br />Ballotine de Poulet a la Grandmere ($28.50) 👎🏻This was the most disappointing dish as the stuffed roasted chicken leg had no wow factor at all\n<br />.\n<br />Wild Mushroom Risotto ($24) 👍🏻Love how well the creamy arborio rice was simmered in white wine\n<br />.\n<br />Concorde ($22) 👎🏻This savory crepe with roasted chicken &amp; bacon was just average &amp; ordinary\n<br />.\n<br />Forest Berries Tea and French Apple Tart ($9.50 per pot) 👍🏻These caffeine free new teas were just right to compliment with the cakes\n<br />.\n<br />Superlova ($10) Lovely pink cake and we love the rose finger sponge, lychee, yuzu cream &amp; rose macaron though this was slightly too sweet to have it all by oneself\n<br />.\n<br />Ang Bao ($10) 👍🏻Dark chocolate mousse with caramel mandarin cremeux, cashew nut nougatine and cocoa sponge cake was just delightful\n<br />.\n<br />Charlotte III ($9) 👍🏻Our love of the night! Strawberry mousse, forest berries jelly, chiffon cake, white chocolate vanilla cream was just the perfect dessert to round up the nite\n<br />💕
Missing this bake that rode the waves of the cheese tart trend high last year. Cupped in flaky puff pastry are seven types of cheese molten into one gloriously velvety blend.
-\n<br />A four-layer savoury sandwich cake with pretty pink beetroot cream cheese chantilly and adorned with a medley of roasted vegetables. Somewhat like Swedish #Smorgastarta. A refreshing change from the usual Christmas cakes.\n<br />-\n<br />#antoinette #penhas #christmas2016
Review by a friend:\n<br />This elegant dessert is both satisfying and a visual feast.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Typical rose flavoured desserts have a tendency to easily cloy your tastebuds, this exquisite rose petal mousse log cake has just the right hint of citrus. Rose finger sponge with raspberry jelly, raspberry caviar &amp; crumble is delectably lifted by the yuzu cream.\n<br />🔸\n<br />While the portion may be considered small for some (pictured medium, slightly longer than my hand size), I would say this is perfect to share among a couple of friends. Not to mention it gives you all the more reason to continue indulging in @antoinette_sg \'s other desserts!
It was all too easy to conquer this \"Mont Blanc\". Base camp was a crunchy almond tart while the \"snow\"-dusted trail leading up was made from smooth chestnut cream. Within the mini mountain lay a core of my favourite vanilla chantilly cream and little bits of candied chestnuts.\n<br />I may not be into desserts or pastries that feature chestnuts generally, but this, I liked a lot.
One of the Best I have tried, should come during teatime break as it will sold out fast
Light almond sponge cake, drizzled with a raspberry eau de vie and topped with a smooth vanilla Chantilly, then filled with a pistachio crème mousseline and crisp Japanese Chitose strawberries. #MediaInvite
If you like things with salted egg yolk... try this! Salted Egg Truffle.
A savoury Roasted Vegetable cake from @antoinette_sg for Christmas this year.
Check out @chef_pang @antoinette_sg new Chocolat Fetish with Valrhona Chocolates that is happening till the end of October! It\'s a chocolate feast this time. Super adore this Macaron Burger ($12) with a chocolate ganache “patty”, apricot “cheese”, raspberry “ketchup”, salted caramel cream “mustard” and white chocolate “lettuce” between chocolate macaron shells. More on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio!
The chocolate taste here was bolder and stronger than the salmon dish, which was quite interesting because since when does anyone eat beef with chocolate? But try this with an open mind and you will be pleasantly surprised at how complementary the chocolate and beef was. A very rich dish due to the fatty braised wagyu beef and thick creamy chocolate sauce, this is best shared with someone. Worth mentioning was also the handmade parpadelle pasta. It was al dente and the sauce was able to coat each strand sufficiently.
Currently craving for something sour and sweet; finally the struggles of cutting down sugar feel so real. And looking at this dessert makes it worse. My favourite element was sadly not the strips of french meringue, but the refreshingly bold passion fruit banana sorbet. I would rather have the crepe and sorbet without those pavlova and vanilla creme chantilly. Oh, and I thought the chocolate sauce was kinda a misfit in the dish.
Bf and I tried 5 items from the menu and we agreed that this was our favourite. He loved how \'medium\' the flesh of the salmon was, and I loved how crisp the salmon skin was 😂. The white chocolate hollandiase sauce was creamy yet not overly sweet, and the green apple slices at the side complemented the dish well. We only wished the salmon was bigger! Chocolat Fetish is available until 31st Oct.
Also highly recommended: Invader Inside. A gimmicky looking tin that has SEVEN layers of different chocolates, popping candy and a moist, sponge cake hidden by mousse and creme. What a treat! You can buy the whole little tin for $15 and give it as a gift. The bronze little invader is edible too - a dark, bitter chocolate that leaves an echoing aroma of cocoa in your mouth. Don\'t worry, you\'ll sweeten it with the other melding layers and be totally entertained by the incessant popping of hidden popping candies in the plastic can. As always, so indulgent. This is part of @antoinette_sg\'s chocolate fetish menu that will last till October, so grab it soon! #chocolate #deathbychocolate
Sign me up for anything chocolate! @antoinette_sg is dishing up an insane menu of chocolatey delights (over 20 items!) and this chocolate macaron burger is just one of the items. Somewhat in between the size of a slider and a large macaron, it is so intense, it has to be shared between two (or even four!) people. Sandwiched between the chocolate-laced macaron is \"lettuce\" made of white chocolate, \"ketchup\" made of raspberry, apricot \"cheese\" and a chocolate ganache patty. *gulp* Dark chocolate lovers will like the bitterness that accompanies the patty. A deeper look into the menu coming up over the next few days! #chocolate #chocolateforever
•\n<br />Less than two weeks to mid-autumn festival!!\n<br />•\n<br />Truffle-centred snow skin mooncakes that can be enjoyed two ways: Chilled for a creamy texture or slightly warmed for a oozing centre.\n<br />•\n<br />Each box contains:\n<br />Low Sugar White Lotus Paste with Salted Egg Truffle x 2\n<br />Chestnut Lotus Paste with White Chocolate Matcha Truffle x 2\n<br />Low Sugar White Lotus Paste with Dark Chocolate Truffle x 2\n<br />Longan Goji Berry with Cashew Nuts x 1\n<br />Dark Chocolate Lotus Paste with Crunchy Pearls x 1\n<br />•\n<br />Can\'t decide which I like better – the chilled or lava mooncakes as they are equally good!!\n<br />•\n<br />PS: Both the Longan Goji Berry and Dark Chocolate Crunchy Pearls won\'t ooze but still as yummy! Love the Chocolate Crunchy Pearls!
Aside from the aesthetic magic that the emerald green filling creates, Antoinette’s Matcha Croissant ($6) was a fine contrast of textures!
That rich, dark, sticky caramel peppered with vanilla beans and oozing out of a flaky, almond-crusted croissant – no wonder I\'m enamoured of it.
Aside from the aesthetic magic that the emerald green filling creates, Antoinette’s Matcha Croissant ($6) was a fine contrast of textures!
As if that\'s not enough, the thick bitter-sweet matcha gives the croissant an interesting tweak from typical cream cheese or jam. It\'s understandable that people claim Antoinnete\'s croissants to be the most value-for-money because they definitely are with such a generous amount of filling and beautiful croissant.
The Matcha Fetish ends this July by Antoinette . Quality Green Tea powder from Nishio, Japan is used in different forms of pastries and pasta too! Do pop by Antoinette for some Matcha indulgence.\n<br />@antoinette_sg
Pancakes at Antoinette are still the best. Haven\'t found anything that comes close really. Although not cheap at $13, it\'s still something I would gladly pay for.
Each macaron seems to be jelly filled! The matcha macaron was a surprise as the jelly was somewhat  sour? 😱 but the rest of the macarons were of interesting flavours like praline and sesame! 👏👍 In the recent newspaper articles, they\'ve been talking about how your breakfast is logically related to the rates of getting diabetes and everyone\'s saying you should take less sugar to curb your appetite for the rest of the day. I however, know that doesn\'t work for me.
Instead of the usual pasta noodles, gnocchi is a dumpling-like item which can be made from a variety of ingredients including flour, cheese, egg and potatoes. It is basically potato cubes on steroids! 🤓There was a very strong savoury taste here, which probably comes from the aged Parmesan cheese and the white wine cream sauce. Together with the poached egg, a mouthful would give an explosion of flavours. 😍\n<br />See the full review at www.thehungrygeek.com (active link at bio)
5/5 all time favourite!! Best cake everrrr (worth it despite the high price) 
This is @Antoinette_SG @Chef_Pang\'s #Matcha Pancake, enjoyed with marron glacé Chantilly and maple syrup.
If you\'re in need of something sweet, then have some matcha chocolates or cookies from @antoinette_sg instead. Hee. Cute bite marks by this bugs bunny. Remember to check out the rest of the matcha offerings at the Penhas outlet!
Fluffy eggy center with a distinct matcha flavor, with a crunchy caramelized crunch around. So dayums!! The matcha crepe with chestnut purée also has my ❤️❤️❤️ Head on down to Antoinette for all these yummy goodies starting today!
Insane matcha overload at @antoinette_sg last night! @chef_pang created 22 delicious matcha items ranging from macarons to cookies, chocolates, cakes, crepes, pancakes, French toast, and even pasta! If you have a MEGA sweet tooth, you would love this. Catch the action on Snapchat @msskinnyfat while you can. Let the matcha madness unleash TODAY!
Antoinette just made my matcha dream come true! The Matcha Fetish featuring 22 matcha savoury and sweet options is launching at their 30 Penhas Road outlet today till end July 2016.
Light &amp; fluffy matcha pancakes with a marron glacé Chantilly perfumed with rum and maple syrup. I like how the matcha creations here incorporated the matcha into their ingredients itself — matcha powder is added into the pancake mix. \n<br />The La Carte Fetish Matcha ($190++ for 4), which includes this pancake and many other treats, is available at Antoinette Penhas till end July 2016.
Well, get ready for a full-fledged Matcha experience with Chef Pang\'s upcoming @Antoinette_SG Matcha Fetish where he\'ll be serving up 22 Matcha creations, ranging from hot, savoury dishes to cakes, confectioneries and drinks. \n<br />The Antoinette Matcha Fetish is available 1 Jun to 31 Jul.
Back to Antoinette for a 2nd time, love the ambience here. Great atmosphere, perfect to get a cup of tea and dessert as you relax. Once again having their Grand Cru Chocolate Croissant($7). Love the crisp and buttery croissant, as well as dipping it into the overflowing chocolate goodness! 😉
Dubbed as the best salted egg yolk croissant in SG. Love the buttery and crisp croissant, that u can hear it crack open 😍. Salted egg yolk lava is well balanced in terms of its sweetness and saltiness. I think the staff could heat it awhile longer in order to optimize its taste though 🤔
; Hot Stuff
I have a new found love in you. \n<br />I have yet to visit Antoinette but thanks to my lovely friends who keep getting it for me. This is probably my 6th salted egg croissant from @antoinette_sg and I\'ve pretty much mastered the reheating process and enjoying it as breakfast! \n<br />Totally in love with the thin and flaky croissant exterior and the almost custard liked salted egg goodness on the inside!
The croissant itself is still crispy, flaky and buttery, revealing fresh crab meat with the rich blend of specially concocted \"rempah\" and house-made tomato sauce for the perfect sweet and spicy notes. The chilli crab taste is not so overpowering, which you can still get to enjoy the croissant\'s buttery goodness.
My personal fav will be salted caramel cheese tart ($2.60++). Chocolate and salted egg ($3++) ones are not bad too. -M
I am not a matcha lover ,but this matcha croissant impress me 😜matcha lover should try it out !Overall rating :3.5/5
A photo that didn\'t do justice to the croissant OTL. Loved the buttery croissant matched with the chilli crab filling which delivers a nice kick.
Cause the sheer richness of it will overwhelm you after the first. Stopping at one works here: the cheese fillings are thick, creamy, and super duper rich, held together by a flaky pasteis de nata puff pastry. Of all I tried, the salted caramel was my fave! The vanilla is good if you really wanna get the full cheese blast. Matcha and chocolate weren\'t too bad, but I found them so distinct flavours they kinda conflicted with the cheese.
Gooey cheese, crisp buttery flakey pastry with generous fillings in it. Wasn\'t overly rich plus it was a good size such that one could finish the entire thing and not be sick of it. I thought the Matcha ($2.60) was pretty good cos\' it wasn\'t the sweet kind, but G didn\'t like it that much and preferred the Salted Yolk ($3) which was quite light. #burpple
Essentially 4 cheese. It\'s not particularly exciting and I felt that the flowing cheese in the middle tasted like whip potato. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Grand Cru Chocolate Croissant ($7) Amazing crisp butter croissant with a luscious chocolate filling !👍😣😣\n<br />took it home to enjoy :p
So I FINALLY BOUGHT THE CROISSANTS. The person told me to eat this immediately because the kaya would turn sour if I didn\'t consume it with immediacy. Well, they didn\'t provide take away for this because they are worried that the quality would be compromise and I reassured them that I would devour (not my exact word but that\'s what I did anyway lol). So THEY LET ME TAKE THIS AWAY and I was so glad that I did request to take away despite them saying no. Oh, did I mention they have really good service too? I was standing around waiting for a long time and they apologized profusely for the wait. Not only that, they offered to let me sit and served me water during the wait. When they finally fulfilled the order, they thanked me for my patience and stuff. It was really nice of them... (except for one girl who was kinda giving me the \"you\'re blocking people standing around here\" face and was  like oh may I help you and when I went like I\'m waiting for my croissants and she just okay, no smile or whatsoever too, um)
It is a specially concocted molten mix of cheese, encased in a super flakey buttery pastry tart base using a reverse laminating technique. When you take a bite though these freshly baked tarts, it is oozing out with creamy cheesy filling and is not overly jelak. I can easily finish these on my own! Only available at the Penhas outlet.
Matcha Crossiant $6 - the intense bitterness in the matcha lava was slightly overpowering for me, considering the generous amount of filling. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the crossiant more. 🍵🍞
Antoinette\'s interpretation of baked cheese tarts. Featuring 5 flavours : Salted Caramel, Vanilla and Matcha for S$2.60 each &amp; Grand Cru Chocolate and Salted Egg York for S$3.00 each.\n<br />Imagine eating Portuguese egg tart filled with creamy cheese [Pablo Cheese]. For the most cheesy/original flavour, I\'ll recommend going for the Vanilla Cheese Tart. Best paired with a pot of tea.
Came in super airy flaky pastries shell, the flowy cheese fillings were light and not overly jelat. Comes in 5 Flavours (Matcha, Chocolate, salted caramel, Salted Egg &amp; Orignal), the latter two had our unanimous vote for their light yet creamy flavours 😋
Because if you do, you\'ll be setting your mouth on fire. One bite through the flaky, buttery pastry, past the thin, golden cheese skin at the top and you hit the jackpot. A glorious mess of oozing cheese that spurts in your mouth (yes I went there). The initial salty tinge gives way to a creamy sweetness that can only come from vanilla, cream cheese and mascarpone cheese. The cheesy aroma fills the atmosphere and you\'ll be aware of the delicate globules of cream that you didn\'t manage to catch in the first bite. Scrap it off the plate, cause I\'m pretty certain it\'s not gonna be easy to get a second tart. Chef\'s only selling these at the Penhas outlet for now.\n<br />#antoinettesgcheesetart #cheesetart @antoinette_sg \n<br />You can read the full review (coming at 1pm today!) at amandajaynelee.blogspot.sg - link in bio. Also, thanks @bing_leow and team again for fattening me up with delicious foods 😘
At 11am later today, he\'ll be releasing a series of FIVE cheese tarts at the Penhas outlet: Vanilla, prepared using Madagascan vanilla; Salted caramel; bittersweet Grand Cru Chocolate, 55% and 65% cocoa intensity; Matcha; and Salted egg yolk (prices range $2.60-$3 each).
The Chili Crab Croissant combines Antoinette’s well-loved croissant with a chilli crab filing of real crabmeat, specially concocted “rempah”, as well as a house-made tomato sauce to create the comforting sweet and spicy flavours loved by Singaporeans.
Chloe is a petit cake with Yuzu cremeux, white chocolate vanilla mousse, almond stable and a light sponge cake. It\'s refreshing and light on the palate.
Did a takeaway in the afternoon and reheated my croissant before eating it now. The pastry remained flaky and crispy. However the best was the thick matcha oozing out when I sliced the croissant into half. Gorgeous.
Unfortunately the kaya flopped. Should kaya taste sour? Or have a really strong seng aftertaste? Don\'t think so, therefore this was a fail for me. Aside from feeling that the kaya\'s spoilt, the flavour\'s also more pandan than coconutty, and while the pastry was good there was nothing charcoal-y about it.
Le Quatre Fromages: ooey gooey cheese mix of sharp aged cheddar, nutty gruyere, parmesan, and mozzarella; held together by a wonderfully flaky, buttery, and tasty croissant. Impressive sounding cheeses aside, what really made this humble croissant pop was the stellar pastry. Definitely not the most pocket-friendly option out there, but it\'s worth indulging in.
At least to huge matcha fans, par exemple moi. The silky-smooth-super-intense-mad-rich-manically-luscious matcha custard was to die for. Don\'t be expecting a sweet pastry - the matcha filling\'s really more bitter than sweet, so it\'ll definitely please matcha purists.
Served within minutes upon ordering to heat up the croissant so that you can get your camera ready for some instaworthy food photos! Piping hot kaya flowing out once you cut open the croissant. Perfect ratio so your croissant won\'t feel left out hahaha. 😋
None of that overly sweet green tea crap that is commonly served elsewhere, #AntoinetteSG uses matcha powders sourced from the city of Nishio in the Aichi prefecture of Japan for a filling that sports a distinctive and pleasant bitterness in the midst of a subtle sweetness.
MATCHA Croissant and Charcoal KAYA Croissant!! Newly launched today, I am super sure you don\'t wanna miss them 😋😋😋
⠀⠀\n<br />Antoinette launches its final series of croissants today at the Penhas outlet - Charcoal Kaya Croissant, Matcha Croissant and Quatre Fromages (Four Cheeses) Croissant. The Charcoal Kaya is the frontrunner from this session, being so alluringly pandan-fragrant your mouth would repel bugs for days.
The final three From Antoinette\'s La Croissanterie Breakfast Series: \n<br />- Quatre Fromages 4 Cheeses: with aged Cheddar, Gruyère, Parmesan and Mozzarella — \n<br />- Charcoal Kaya Croissant \n<br />- Matcha: made using matcha powder from Nishio in the Aichi prefecture of Japan
Using crème patisserie methods, @Chef_Pang creates a perfect balance between the two ingredients, leaving a subtly sweet yet pleasantly bitter filling. Gao gao max! 
The Queen’s Kaya is based on the classic French crème patissiere, made with coconut cream and pure pandan juice with no artificial colours or flavouring. This is so irresistible!
Antoinette\'s Salted Yolk Lava Croissant has been voted by Daniel Food Diary to be the best salted egg croissant in Singapore. If salted egg is not your thing, Antoinette also has Chilli Crab Croissant. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg 
Such a beautiful, saccharine sweet dessert to kill off my Monday blues 😍 
Inspired by the bright colours of the season, this pretty dessert features a sour, tart raspberrry mousse, earthy pistachio bavarois and sponge cake, sweet forest berries jelly, on a crunchy almond sable biscuit!
@antoinette_sg has launched the Salted Caramel Croissant. Available today at the Penhas outlet and from 25 March from the Mandarin Gallery and Sofitel So outlet. $6++
This is not a new creation or a trending item that commands snaking queues. It is instead, a fine example of a fail-safe crowd-pleaser that is on point in every way.\n<br />Squiggled with salty caramel, the Nutella-filled crepe is soft and eggy but not overly so (because it would then be an omelette, wouldn\'t it? Heehee...) Built upon this\n<br />scrumptious base are paper-thin shards of caramelised filo and pouffy dollops of vanilla chantilly cream. The complete contrast of these two textures with the cold creaminess of the Nougatine ice-cream enhances the partaking of the crepe to nirvana-dom.\n
Tried chilli crab xlb before and which was mehhh, so expectations for this was pretty low... 
Pity came a day too early to try their salted caramel croissant.😉
Served on an oval plate, there was enough capellini to feed two people, especially if they plan to indulge in the wide array of desserts Antoinette is famous for. The overall taste was deeply umami-yummy due to the pasta being tossed in crustacean oil, and the lavish amount of crispy savoury ebi sprinkled all over. Bringing on some green and another facet of flavour to the dish was the baby arugula - I personally love it when chefs use this as a finishing touch. For sure, the curled-up sea shrimps were on the petite side, but they didn\'t lack in sweetness.
Review of the savory ones up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio! But here\'s a preview of their soon to be launched sweet ones.. Guess the flavor!
The dessert selection they\'ve got isn\'t wide but sufficient to at least have something for every palate. The cakes are at least a 7/10 experience. But at about 6 bucks a pop, some may think 7/10 isn\'t good enough. But the ambience does help. 
Yet another successful rendition of east meets west. Tada ~~ CHILLI CRAB CROISSANT! Good O\' flaky croissant with generously stuffed chilli crab is da yum. Suitable even for people who can\'t really take spicy food. Would really love to see an extra spicy version coming out soon. 😋😋😋
This is another unique one-of-a-kind dessert that you won\'t find anywhere else. \n<br />See full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/09/antoinette-salted-egg-yolk-croissant-the-best/
Chef Pang of #AntoinetteSG has launched two new, savoury viennoiseries as part of the group’s growing La Croissanterie Antoinette series - #ChilliCrab #Croissant, and Scallion Arlette.
Here is the Chili Crab Croissant. If digging crab meat is too troublesome for you, this sweet and spicy crab with house-made spicy tomato sauce might just do. Try if you like French laminated pastry with local spicy, salty, sweet PHIL-ing. Maybe the ends of the croissant should have been studded with the ends of crab pincers! That would be so fierce! ($7.50+, available at 11 am today, best eaten when it comes out fresh at the bakery)
⠀\n<br />The spiritual successor to the muchly-lauded smash hit salted egg lava croissant, launching 11am today along with the new 蔥油餅-inspired Scallion Arlette.
First it was all about that golden flowy gooey Salted Egg Lava Croissant, and now we have the brand new Chili Crab Croissant and Scallion Arlette by the invention master Chef Pang of @antoinette_sg \n<br />I always knew that the buttery flaky crisp croissant would go well with shredded Chili Crab filling that is made from a special rempah. It\'s a little on the sweet side and we would love more chunks but that lingering spiciness was yums! \n<br />The Scallion Arlette is exactly a French 蔥油餅 “Chong You Bing”) with a flakier and crunchier texture! This may be the next big thing in pastry under Chef Pang\'s hands.
Honestly, this is MUCH better than the salted egg yolk! \n<br />The Chili Crab Croissant combines Antoinette’s well-loved croissant with a chili crab filing of real crab meat, specially concocted “rempah”, as well as a house-made tomato sauce to create the comforting sweet and spicy flavours loved by Singaporeans. I really love this one! \n<br />The Chili Crab Croissant is priced at $7.50++ and will be made available first at its Penhas outlet today at 11am every weekday and 10am every weekend.
Love the generous amt of meat in this plate of pasta!!
When everyone is crazy over their salted egg yolk croissant, this simple french toast was overshadowed. The first time I love eating cream was that beautiful light cream paired with caramelised banana. For its price in the luxurious Parisian restaurant setting, this dessert definitely stole my heart. 
Great breakfast but a little too pricey for the kind of ingredients used. Bacon only 2 pcs.. A sausage, greens, tomatoes, 2 small breads, 2 toast and scrambled eggs (additional $3) for the way it is done. Its gd but i guess i have eaten better. $24++ before changing eggs to scrambled.. 
Very tasty with generous filling of salted egg yolk. $6:50++ for this. Pastry was also fluffy and done nicely.
Just the way I like it :) Antoinette\'s big breakfast with bacons, sausages, choice of eggs , toast, croissants and a drink of coffee/tea/Choc
Florentine??? It is basically ham, cheese, sunny side up with hollandaise sauce on a crepe. Good but not awesome haha \n<br />Anyway, the cafe is located near Jalan Besar Stadium. A good place to be chill in the afternoon but slightly atas\n<br />#burpple
Antoinette’s well-loved croissant the perfect companion, in the form of a smooth, creamy and decadent salted egg yolk flling oozing out of its light and airy centre. 
Glad my first taste of this trending salted egg croissant was at Antoinette! Croissant\'s flawless - flaky, buttery, crisp and moist at the right parts - and the luscious salted egg filling was both generous and delicious, nailing the balance between savoury and sweet. It may be a little too rich for some, but with a flavour that intense what else would you expect?
Supposedly touted as the best in Singapore currently, Antoinette has sold out their version of salted egg croissant on the first day of its launch at its Penhas outlet. At $6.50++ a piece, you will have to expect long queues for dining in and takeaway.
Getting myself into the \"salted egg yolk croissant\" craze by first trying the rendition of Antoinette. The buttery yet light croissant was lovely when paired with the thick \"liu sha\" (which apparently uses 3 eggs). The minute bits of egg yolks in the liu sha reminds me of the salted egg yolk in the moon cake and I love the balance of sweet and salty here. Personally, it didn\'t feel jelat for me and yes, it\'s instagram-worthy with that salted egg yolk oozing out from both halves of the croissant 😍
Despite keeping it overnight and reheated it up, it is still oozing out a rich luscious creamy salted egg yolk lava from its light and airy center, with a crispy, flaky and buttery outer. I\'ll never get sick of salted egg 😋! This is definitely worth my calories!
The croissants at Antoinette are freshly baked using the traditional French method to achieve these crispy, flaky and buttery outer, with a rich luscious creamy salted egg yolk lava oozing out of its light and airy center. The filling is made with 3 salted egg yolks, sugar and milk, and hand sieved into that silky smooth texture. Forget about the diet; this is definitely worth the calories!
2 was in minor casualty, while the 3rd truly flowed in a pool of yellow. \n<br />The flaky fluffy croissant entered our bellies happily, while the Liu Sha reminded how much calories we have to burn off to consume it. \n<br />Okay, am a satisfied person. #流沙没有白流 #别吃不到咸蛋黄说蛋黄臭 #减肥开始
Yeap! It\'s a start of a great Friday morning !! Salted egg croissant $6.50+
😂 nonetheless the salted egg still flowed. I heated it at 160C in my Artisan oven for about 6.5 minutes and let it cooled for about 1 minute while I set up the tripod and.. Spent about 5 minutes snapping pictures of it and the croissant was still astonishingly flaky and crispy! The salted egg goodness was sweet and oh so heavenly too!! Thank you to my wonderful friend for delivering all these goodies to MEH!! 😘
The ends are so crispy, flaky and buttery. Good flow with the salted egg yolk filling ! 😘
Anyway, I kept it over night and had it for breakfast the next day. And was pleasantly surprise at how \'liu\' the salted egg filling is still. Overall it\'s thick and gao 😹👍🏼 |
😋✨🤓 Salted egg yolk croissant craving fixed at 11:30 am .
Croissant with salted egg filling. 😍 3 salted eggs are used in the process of making this. I prefer this compared to Seven Oaks. Have you got yours yet? Happy midweek everyone!
It soothes crying  babies, at least for @limmilkmilk \n<br />She will have to wait till she is much older to taste sugar, flour, salted egg yolk. Mua ha ha ha... Meanwhile she can lick her toy croissant.
Had an (early morning) opportunity to sample @Antoinette_SG\'s Salted Egg Lava Croissant ($6.50) that is officially launching later today (1 Feb), 11am at their Penhas outlet. \n<br />Made using premium French butter, the traditional French pastry is \'ooooh\'-inducing buttery and delightfully flaky at the same time, with just enough bite, then decadently filled with a rich, creamy golden salted egg filling (of real salted egg yolks, milk and sugar, and hand-sieved to a smooth and luscious texture). Extremely value-for-money (filling) and rewarding bite at only $6.50. Limited quantities daily, so grab yours quick.
So much work, so tasty. \n<br />Start your February with one of these... Lol. Eating one of these is equivalent to having half a day\'s calories intake? I shall skip lunch.
@antoinette_sg uses real natural salted egg yolks, sugar and milk, and hand-sieved it to give the \'salted egg yolk lava\' you see here. \'Salted Yolk Lava Croissant\', $6.50 available from their Penhas store today from 11 AM. If you can wait, they will start selling it on the 3rd day of CNY (10 Feb) onwards at their Mandarin Gallery and Sofitel So Singapore stores at 1pm daily.
For $6.50 a pop, you get a handcrafted, made from scratch salted egg yolk lava plus French croissant. Drools!!! This will retail at the other outlets from 10 feb at 1pm daily. Time to get in line folks.
Ehat\'s so special about it? It\'s East meets West. This is the \'Salted Yolk Lava Croissant\'. Limited quantity. Had it early this morning at @antoinette_sg\'s Penhas outlet. $6.50, limited quantity daily and available today from 11 am! If you love both crispy warm flaky croissant and love Salted Egg Yolk lava. You got go queue now.....
How do you make Antoinette\'s already awesome flaky croissants better? Stuff it with an oozesome salted egg filling, that\'s how! 😋😋 Needless to say, eat it while it\'s warm so the sweet and savoury lava flows.
My Sunday breakfast courtesy of @essensosg and @antoinette_sg! Although I don\'t really fancy coffee, Essenso MicroGround Coffee ☕️ was actually very aromatic! It\'s a blend of finely ground Arabica coffee beans and soluble instant coffee. Also, it\'s paired with pastries and sweets 🍬 specially curated by Chef Pang of Antoinette for both the 2 in 1 and 3 in 1 coffees.
Too pretty Terrarium Mousse Cake from @antoinette_sg. I love digging into this mini dome filled with dark chocolate mousse, passionfruit parfait, caramelized banana flambé with dark rum, cocoa sponge soaked with more rum, and smoked almond nougatine! They also have a 1kg option for $120, which is perfect for Christmas gatherings! 😍😍😍
Tucking into the new Christmas collection at @Antoinette_sg this rainy afternoon. // the {Terrarium} is this beautiful bowl of chocolate, rum, bananas and everything nice with a sour tinge of Passionfruit parfait to offset the richness of the entire universe. \n<br />#whati8today #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #sgfoodies #burpple #hungrygowhere #mehmehgang
How charming is this concept - it\'s an edible version of a terrarium! Every component of this \"tiny garden\" has been created with care to be combined into a most picturesque dessert. Within the clear plastic sphere, you can dig into dark chocolate mousse, passionfruit parfait, caramelised banana flambé with dark rum, light cocoa sponge cake with dark rum and smoked almond nougoutine. The mini size would be just right for one or two persons. Large groups can consider having the 1 kg option ($120). I\'m not sure if it requires to be ordered in advance though. Best to call and check. \n
If I had to nominate a plated dessert that symbolises prettiness, I\'d say this would be it. Utterly feminine in looks and flavour, this froufrou creation has a light and crunchy base of rose meringue filled with lychee compote and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. \"Floating\" just above is a ooh-worthy cloud of spun sugar.\n<br />Lovely as it is, I recommend sharing this. Unless you have a very sweet tooth.
Courtesy of Antoinette and Citigold :) Antoinette has a wide variety of cakes and we decided on Chloe [ yuzu cremeux, white chocolate vanilla mousse, light sponge cake , almond sable] . The strong flavor from the yuzu cremeux is what makes the cake so delicious!  Sadly it\'s only one layer of the cake.. and when you reach the end with only the mousse, the cake tasted quite tasteless.. Tip: eat from the back to ensure an everlasting yuzu taste in your mouth! On the whole it\'s a beautiful and tasty cake 😋
Redeemed for free from Citibank. So exquisite. Couldn\'t bear to finish. Smooth tofu like white chocolate mousse . 
Inspired by Summer fruits and flowers, these 5 new additions to Antoinette\'s classics are (clockwise from top right): Summer (Pistachio Bavarois, Raspberry Mousse, Forest Berries Jelly, Pistachio Sponge &amp; Glaze), Jasmin (Chiffon Cake, Walnut Sesame Nougatine, Jasmine Flower Mousse, Osmanthus Gel &amp; Mango Jelly), Lemon Meringue (Lemon Mousse, Praline Bavarois, Lemon Confit, Italian Meringue, Cocoa Sponge, Finger Sponge, Kirsch &amp; Praline Feuilletine), Orangette (Dark Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Genoise with Grand Marnier, Orange Marmalade &amp; Orange Praline Feuilletine) &amp; Pavlova (Rose Petal Meringue, Finger Sponge, Yuzu Cream, Lychee, Rose Crème Mousseline &amp; Raspberry Jelly). #foodporn #foodiesg #burpple
A day made better by a wonderful meal at Antoinette @antoinette_sg. \n<br />This is part of their 4th anniversary set meal available only till end of this month at $40++ per pax, expect a 4 course meal of well-executed and well thought dishes that also include vegetables terrine, choice of chicken roulade or braised beef and a delightful yuzu sobert to end the meal.
Essentially a jasmine tea-infused chiffon cake which had accidentally strayed onto the set of a Chinese wuxia period drama and got pelted by the props simulating various vicious Oriental-style attacks such as “Jasmine Petal Blizzard”, “Osmanthus Rain”, “Snow Fungus Bomb”, “Goji Berry Blast” and “White Chocolate Orbs”. Jasmine tea mousse lends a gentle floral fragrance, a layer of mango jelly provides refreshing sweetness and sesame walnut nougatine adds crunch to the proceedings.
Hello Jasmin.
Essentially a jasmine tea-infused chiffon cake which had accidentally strayed onto the set of a Chinese wuxia period drama and got pelted by the props simulating various vicious Oriental-style attacks such as “Jasmine Petal Blizzard”, “Osmanthus Rain”, “Snow Fungus Bomb”, “Goji Berry Blast” and “White Chocolate Orbs”. Jasmine tea mousse lends a gentle floral fragrance, a layer of mango jelly provides refreshing sweetness and sesame walnut nougatine adds crunch to the proceedings.
The Pomodoro sauce was nice and meaty. But the tagliatelle pasta was a little too soft. Would have preferred it to be al dente.
Duck breast was served medium rare. The pieces closer to the sides were just nice and gave a nice meaty bite. However, those nearer to the centre were a bit raw. The meat they use weren\'t the freshest for that rawness. I do like their plating though. It\'s a very pretty plate of food. If you are the type that would pay more for aesthetics than taste, then this place is good.
A competent competitor to Henri Charpentier in the arsonist dessert stakes. The lights above your table are switched off as Grand Marnier set ablaze cascades down in a ghostly blue waterfall over your massive purple meringue. The ice cream and very wince-inducing sour cherries are perfunctory and mere wallpaper to the blackcurrant meringue, which was essentially a giant goop of inebriating, berry-sweet pleasure. 4/5 
I should have went straight for the dark chocolate part and avoided the white altogether, as the latter was like a spurned ex-lover who can\'t let go and persistently keeps leaving yearnful Whatsapp messages. Whilst I liked the peanut butter-esque peanut presence, the chocolate mousse with raspberry jam were quite perfunctory and the rum was likely to be in Bangkok during this long weekend. 3.1/5
Anyone who\'s tried Antoinette\'s cakes would know that not only do Chef Pang\'s creations look aesthetically amazing (c\'mon, just look at this blushing bunny), they taste pretty darn amazing too.
This is an interesting twist to the Christmas fruit cake with Chinese festive elements. The rich butter cake is infused with the flavours of red dates, roasted pine nuts, dried longan fruit, candied ginger, kaffir lime leaves, walnuts, goji berries, tangerine peel and spices, to create an exquisite treat.
An interesting reinvention of a Lunar New Year dish at Antoinette is set change preconceptions forever. Hail to the Queen\'s Yu Sheng in a form of a large golden egg. Hidden inside is not the classic raw fish salad, but a nest of auspicious sweets and refreshing ingredients.
This is your classic American breakfast, done the Antoinette way. Scrambled eggs, grilled bacon and sausage, homemade Pain de Mie, viennoiseries and a cup of hot chocolate. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
Nothing beats Chef Pang\'s freshly baked croissants to start the day! Warm, crusty and full of flaky, buttery goodness, these viennoiseries are soft and fluffy yet crisp, melting in the mouth with each bite. All I need is a cool slab of Lurpak to have it with! Available at all Antoinette outlets on weekends.
I was more fascinated by the ambience though the food was not bad. It was not as pricey as I expected.
These prettily decorated Christmas macarons are such a delight. Désir (purple) is filled with dense and rich chestnut cream with blackcurrent jelly. Fruitier (yellow) is a sweet jelly of raspberry and lime, with tart green lime cream. Rum and raisin (brown) has a subtle taste of dark rum from its rum cream and rum steeped raisins, powdered with shimmery gold dust. And my favorite, Foret blanc (cream) envelopes smooth and rich dark chocolate cream with a brandied cherry center. Divine!
When I was young, mom used to tell me that pretty cakes never taste as good as it looks. That was before Antoinette was born. I believe it\'s time I introduced her to Chef Pang at Antoinette. 😉 This Foret Noir will satisfy the desires of any chocolate lovers with its smooth Valrhona dark chocolate (66%) mousse, kirsch infused chantilly, light chocolate genoise with kirsch and brandied cherries. Be still, my beating heart. 😍
Christmas is here! This edible chocolate pot is filled with caramel choux puffs sprinkled with crunchy bits of chopped almond filled with chocolate creme Chantilly cream, decorated with candy-colored chocolate balls and a gold star on the top! Love how pretty and festive it is—the perfect centerpiece for a Christmas party! 😋
For a classy looking place, I thought everything on the menu would be pricey. Sure it\'s definitely more of a restaurant than a cafe pricing, but the eggs are surprising \'affordable\' abt $16+. I loved the brioche so much I wish I could buy a loaf back home, and hollandaise sauce was thick but not too buttery to my liking. Eggs were perfectly poached as well - definitely a winner! 
Good way to end the meal with a light dessert of strawberries and rum~
Was expecting a more dramatic affair but the flame died after a few seconds... Nevertheless, super delicious dessert with ice cream and cherries within~ strongly recommended for sharing...
Love the ambience,  never say No to the sweets menu and Vanilla meringues!  The cakes are for dessert lovers who love their cakes less sweet. This is one of the places to find Baked alaska - sugar x 10! Perfect venue for your date who loves delicate desserts.
Advance birthday treat for Camay! Food was quite disappointing. More misses than hits but we enjoyed the sweet dessert section! Especially the cakes. 
Most known it for their luxurious desserts, Antoinette now gives you good reason to come by for lunch with their newly-launched all-day menu. Drop by any of their three outlets for a glorious lunch with your best friend or your mum. If you feel like something light, go for The Grand Garden of Antoinette, a gorgeous version of a roast duck salad that makes you feel like a queen. For a hearty meal, the Crab Pomodoro will blow you away with its spicy white wine tomato sauce and chunky crab meat. Of course, don\'t you dare leave without ordering a dessert - especially the irresistible Strawberry Baba!
Price of cake range from $8.5-$10 exclusive of service charge and gst (even for take aways) total damage for these cakes was $44.40! :-) Lovely place to go for tea and to catch up with friends! 
Pasta may not be the first thing you think of ordering at Antoinette, but boy this is one amazing plate of homemade pappardelle. Drenched in a spicy white wine tomato sauce with herbs and clam broth, the chunks of crab meat are just divine. If you love pasta and spice, this is one you should try.
This seared duck breast with pickled pears, poached egg, asparagus, carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, flowers, mushrooms, tomatoes, lotus chips certainly was a treat! Phew just look at all those gorgeous vegetables, it really felt like a luxurious lunch in a garden. 
20.35$ for a box of 6. I expected better quality than these because it\'s ANTOINETTE??? 😔😔 the shells were dry and crumbly. Although I must say that the mooncake flavor - traditional Chinese white lotus paste with salted egg yolk is pretty creative. However, sad to say, they didn\'t really compliment each other. 
The boyfriend loves tomato-based crabmeat pasta, and I\'m definitely going to bring him to try this one: fat ribbons of pappardelle stained with spicy, rustic tomato sauce that\'s infused with clam broth and loaded with shredded crabmeat and pine nuts. \n<br />#crab #crabmeat #pappardelle #pasta #tomato #sauce #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #ilovemyjob
I like my steaks simple, but well-seasoned. This black angus ribeye minute steak ticks all the right boxes with a red wine jus and a bed of potato purée. 
Homemade brioche stuffed with melted gruyere and ham, dipped in egg and fried so the surfaces are light and crisp. Chef Pang makes some pretty amazing French toast, indeed! 
Poached eggs and smoked pork belly dyed in red wine sauce make for a hearty, satisfying brunch. 
Today, I\'m craving for this spectacular salad of mixed greens, baby carrots, asparagus, lotus root chips, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, sunflower seeds, sweet potatoes and beets tied together with a caramel orange dressing. As if all that texture and sweet veggie flavours arent enough, the salad is pumped up with crispy-skinned roasted duck breast and a poached egg from which trickles golden yolk. 
Love anything strawberry, and this one is particularly delicious: a fluffy, spherical yeast cake sitting in a pool of citrus vanilla syrup spiked with dark rum, crowned with creme Chantilly and crumble, and served with kirsch macerated strawberries. 
They serve a variety of cakes, desserts, macarons that look and taste delicious...😊 
Would be even more awesome if the green tea taste is stronger! 
Matcha cake was avg but I like the white one on the right! It was a mix of raspberry(?) and hazelnut cookie in it really special! Cakes were priced from 9++ excluding gst and service charge. A little ex and service was kinda slow too but ambience wise, it was really classy and it made me felt royal XD
Perfect for a luxurious tea-break or dessert after dinner, make yourself comfortable on the plush cushions and gorgeous decor of this Parisan-inspired pâtisserie. Enjoy a pot of tea and select from their huge repertoire of beautifully crafted pastries and desserts. It\'s almost a crime not to order the Antoinette, Chocolate Earl Grey Cake, and the Strawberry Shortcake. These are desserts that actually taste as good as they look.
Amazing pastries! They were served warm and with their own butter recipe, which was heavenly. Best pastries I\'ve ever had! 
Homemade Sakura Ebi &amp; Seaweed Rice Cracker. How does an innocent errand to collect cake turn into a #CNY goodies shopping spree? #love #foodgasm
Cost about $26 odd, came with some pastries. A very scrumptious and rich set of breakfast, definitely worth the money. 
Service is excellent, especially at this branch. And yes I would come here again. 
Finally it\'s here!
Having tried and liked their blueberry pancakes in my previous visit, I decided to order some savoury pancakes (against my colleague\'s advice!). Yums. Some risks do pay off. Photo taken before the pancakes were covered in an indulgent creamy mushroom sauce. Workday lunch at a place with an all day breakfast menu is my guilty pleasure...
\"Friends who love chocolate cake, u can\'t miss this :)\" 
Scrambled egg, grilled bacon and sausage, Pain de Mie toast, basket of viennoiseries and hot chocolate!
Traditional French style pork belly confit served with garlic mash, seasonal vegetables and mustard sauce.
Pretty cakes but not so fantastic taste-wise. Sadaharu Aoki, Hidemi Sugino and Pierre Herme have all spoilt me bad. Come to Antionette for the very pretty setting and cutlery for a girls session.

Monotone ($9)\n<br />.\n<br />There’s nothing really monotone about the flavours of this creation from @antoinette_sg . The grand Cru chocolate mousse envelops the fruit jelly inside that reminds me of passionfruit and the almond nougatine. The tanginess from the fruit jelly cutting into the rich smooth texture of the chocolate mousse sat really well with me! I would also return for the Croissant A La Creme, a simple croissant filled with cream and encrusted with meringue. Simple yet absolutely delightful.

$5.35 for these 2 macarons. Came here to get chocolate larva croissant but it\'s only available on weekends in limited quantity? The macarons taste great w the fresh buttercream and the texture is on point.
In the middle of the cake is a rich salted egg yolk filling, flowing out when slicing through it - Let it flow, Let it flow 🎶\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple
$10 each. A must try. I have a feeling this is only for the upcoming Mother\'s Day. #burpple #tingzieeats
It has popular fillings such as salted yolk lava and salted caramel. It also launches the new Croissant a la crime that comes with airy macaron coating with crime chantilly filling.\n<br />.

Truly grateful for @lweiyong and his listening ear thru this tumultuous period.
A huge sucker for anything pink and rose-flavoured, and this ethereal combination of rose petal mousse, rose sponge, yuzu cream, lychee-raspberry jelly, rose meringue, raspberry \"caviar\", and baby rose macaron tickles all my girlish fancies.
Yes that is the name of this lovely balanced cake for Lunar New Year. The chocolate sponge cake is decked in a luxurious, red chocolate glaze around dark, chocolate mousse with cashew nut nougatine and caramel mandarin cremeux.\n<br />.
*\n<br />Superlova- an elegant cake that is made up of rose finger sponge &amp; rose coral sponge.\n<br />*\n<br />Yuzu cream was spread in between the cake to provide a nice citrus acidity to balance off with the sweetness of the other ingredients.\n<br />*\n<br />The cake was then finish off with silky &amp; shiny rose petal mousse.\n<br />*\n<br />Garnished with lychee, rose petal meringue, raspberry caviar, rose macaron &amp; raspberry crumble.\n<br />*\n<br />It was indeed a very elegant and delicious cake where the Chef really thought of how each components compliment each other in terms of flavour.

Can we take a moment to just look at it? I mean just look at it. How in the world do people come up with such perfection? It is not too sweet, perfect combination of flavours and it\'s a celebration in the mouth. Maybe I would suggest just a touch of cream \"mayonnaise\".

However I thought the buttered parpadelle stole the limelight from the dark chocolate.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #pasta #chocolate #wagyu #beef

Upon pouring the flaming Grand Marnier over the sphere, it revealed a creamy white matcha ganache with almond nougatine and matcha cake enrobed with milk dark chocolate ice cream, exotic fruit compote and almond crumble inside.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #chocolate
The soft bread is not only infused with chocolate but housed a luscious chocolate lava inside. The banana nut crunch cereal provided the extra contrast to the texture. This is the ultimate chocolate heaven for me. A not to be missed dish on the menu if you are a chocolate fan.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple  #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #chocolate #frenchtoast
Chocolate almond tart with caramel fleur de sel, roasted nuts, and a bittersweet dark chocolate ganache, finished with chocolate Chantilly.
I thought it would be too rich for my liking but it turned out otherwise. It was moist, light and well balanced.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #cake #strawberryshortcake
Considering the richness of chocolate, this is actually a light starter with the dark chocolate balsamic sauce on the side to complement the oven roasted carrot and serrano ham.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #ham #chocolate #carrot
Oh I meant the Macaron Burger ($12) from @antoinette_sg, There are many components making up the burger such as the chocolate macaron, chocolate ganache patty, apricot cheese, raspberry ketchup, salted caramel cream mustard and white chocolate lettuce. Give me a beer for my burger. Oh I mean give me a cup of tea.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #macaron #burger #anotinettesg
Besides the beautifully cooked salmon, it also comes with potato puree and caramelized fennel, onion and apple salad. The star has to be the white chocolate sauce that is made from a concoction of cream, vinegar white and sherry, milk, white chocolate and lemon juice. It complemented the moist salmon perfectly and it did not lose its chocolate characteristic.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #salmon #chocolate
The texture of the chocolate pasta skin and the mushroom ragout works for me. It is a excellent dish on its own, minus the fact that it really need a trained tongue to detect the trace of chocolate.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #ravioli #pasta #chocolate

Beneath it\'s pink facade lies rose petal mousse, rose finger sponge, yuzu cream, lychee and raspberry jelly. If you\'re lucky, you might get a piece crowned with the coveted baby rose macaron
*swoons*. Here, that\'s put in the spotlight - Sweet French chestnuts cake and\n<br />Chantilly, perfumed with dark rum is layered then topped with\n<br />with black sugar crumble
My favourite of the batch which also includes his signature salted egg yolk as well as the crowd pleasing chocolate. Available now for pre-order - enjoy 20% off when you place your orders before the 22nd August!
There\'s something to suit every mood
This is Matcha Crepe $16. .\n<br />As always, the crepe is beautifully done with a subtle taste of matcha powder. The French cheatnut puree in the middle is rich to the point of overwhelming. I love the creme chantily and filo sheet on top. I suggest you share this dish with others\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #burpple #antoinettesg #matcha #crepe #matchacrepe #sgdessert #sgdesserts #igsg #igsgfood #stfood #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #dessert #desserts #dessertsg #dessertgram

The cake’s exterior is covered in spinach cream cheese Chantilly with a lush green ‘forest’ mix of salad leaves, herbs and cresses, studded with spinach sago pearls and spinach almond crumble. When cut, you can find three layers of house-made honey country bread drizzled with crustacean oil, slathered in a piquant mix of rich salted egg yolk cream seasoned with curry leaves and chili padi. Adding on to the surprise, each layer holds generous heaps of seafood such as fresh crabs, prawns and squid; sautéed in garlic, ginger, onion and curry leaves for a mild spicy kick.

The cup of matcha latte is served below a raining cloud of cotton candy together with almond cookie, matcha truffle and matcha financier.
I like 👍
Created with a deliciously luscious blend of provolone, reblochon, gruyere, cream cheese, mascarpone, cheddar and parmesan.
About had it with sweet bites? Then you gotta sink your teeth into this rich, creamy, and savory The Queen\'s Cheese Tart ($3) featuring 7 cheeses- provolone, reblochon, cream cheese, mascarpone, gruyere, cheddar and parmesan! That layered pastry is perfect with this molten mix. So dayum!! There isn\'t a better way to kick start the weekend. :) Gonna be jetting out today. Laters people!
😍
The Matcha Pasta is an unexpected creation from Antoinette. The matcha infused pasta is tossed in a truffle paste and topped with salted kombu and sakura ebi. Cooked to al dente, it comes with a delectable bite. It does not have the powdery matcha taste but beautifully perfumed by the truffle and sakura ebi.

Dark, rich and bittersweet.
Liked the chilli crab fillings as it delivered in spiciness and quality of ingredient. Croissant itself was good too. But just not so convinced of it in a sweet croissant.

The charcoal black pastry filled with a liquid kaya (aka Pandan coconut infused crème pat based egg mixture) and the other filled with matcha cream which represented the bitterness and complex grassy notes of the delicacy perfectly. Paired with flaky butter-lacquered pastry; even the strongest of diet-watchers will crack
Antoinette\'s Quatro Fromages Croissant was absolutely delish, with rich oozing cheese 🙃🙃🙃 #liusha #fourcheese #croissant #foodsg

Super flaky texture and filling was more like a sauce.
Another newbie to join the hip-busting line of buttery treats by @Chef_Pang is this {Charcoal Kaya Croissant} - fans of his bottled Pandan infused crème patisserie will come to love this rendition. It\'s amicable personality getting along well with a cup of joe in the mornings

enjoyed this savoury croissant compared to the sweet one ^^ even though it\'s a little spicy for me(low tolerance &gt;
Savoury croissant just taste more cohesive with the buttery pastry compared to the salted egg one where the filling is more sweet than salted. However crab filling is a tad too stingy. \n<br />Gastronometer: 7.5/10
👍🏻 This was alittle more dense and the ice cream had cookies and orange peel in them. 🤖 Wished there was more alcohol though nomnomnom... #sgfood #bakedalaska #burpple
This is a French take of the traditional \"Chong You Bing\". This may look plain but its really packed with beautiful flavours from the spring onion and butter.

Retaining none of the greasiness of its Chinese origins, and maintaining that strikingly clean profile of scallion oil in every bite, the Danish like layers of pastry fleshed out with oodles of good quality buttery crisp, it is another one to cherish at @antoinette_sg :)\n<br />#scallionarlette #congyubing #pastry #antoinettesg #sgfood #foodporn #sgcafe #burpple

♡♡♡\n<br />Though I mumble words of appraisal for the chocolate version, deep down inside,  I\'m awaiting more fun-filled news. A toss-up/mish-mash perhaps? 😆 who could resist a salted caramel ganache filled flaky pastry?  That being said, the rich and covetous dark chocolate ganache that oozes out from within flaky layers is a wonderful composition of Belgian 58% and 65% dark; a sure fire way to lift sullen moods。\n<br />♡♡♡\n<br />#burpple#antoinetteSG#sgfoodporn#pastry#croissant#eyecandySorted#cafehoppingsg#instafood_sg#hungrygowhere#8dayseat#saltedcaramelcroissant
Crossing fingers that my pick, the Salted Caramel, will make the cut for the next launch.
Chef Pang from @antoinette_sg did the amazing again following his much-acclaimed salted yolk lava croissant. Two new savoury croissants that will be loved by local foodies. \n<br />You will ❤️ the asian interpretation of 蔥油餅 on the traditional French Arlette. Wonderfully aromatic and crisp. \n<br />Hawker fans alert as Chilli Crab Croissant is in da house!

It will be available at @antoinette_sg Penhas Flagship out from today 11am onwards while stock last. The other outlets will be available from 14 March. \n<br />Going local this time. The chilli crab croissant consists of real crab meat, specially concocted rempah as well as a house made tomark sauce to create the sweet and spicy flavours. I thought it was going to be another gimmicky creation but I have to say this is the real deal. It is simply your chili crab with mantou, Opppss I mean chilli crab with croissant. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #chillicrab #croissant #antoinettesg

The raspberry marmalade heart as if to symbolize a warm heart beneath its frosty exterior\n<br />•\n<br />This is available in log-cake size as well as individual portions ranging from $10 to $55 to $90.\n<br />•\n<br />#hungrygowhere #burpple #eatoutsg #cakecakecake #instafood_sg #antoinettesg #eyecandySorted #8dayseat #sgfoodporn
A magical garden oasis of butterflies, mushrooms, pebbles, and plants made from delicious dark chocolate mousse, passion fruit parfait, caramelized banana flambé with dark rum, light cocoa sponge cake with dark rum, and smoked almond nougatine! \n<br />This may look small but it\'s more than enough for 12 servings. And the small size version can probably be shared between 3. \n<br />Preorder 3 days before to avoid disappointment as these babies are popular.\n<br />#antoinettesg #antoinette #chefpang #theterrarium #festive #festivemenu #limitedtime #newmenu #desserts #pattiserie #cakecakecake #beautiful

Lo and behold he has actually done it! Jasmine tea flavoured mousse that is elegance wrapped in a dessert, walnut sesame nougatine with the lightest of chiffon encased, finished with a duo of pistachio gel and glaze ... This has to be my new favourite cake ever! Sublime, classy, superb .. The adjectives are endless :)\n<br />#jasmin #cake #chiffon #dessert #antoinettesg #pistachio #teaflavoured #mousse #delicious #classy #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
it was that you can\'t ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence, that\'s all anything ever is, nothing more than coincidence... Tom had finally learned, there are no miracles. There\'s no such thing as fate, nothing is meant to be. He knew, he was sure of it now.\" ~ 500 Days of Summer。
A glossy finish on the pistachio exterior leading into refreshing and fruity tenderness of raspberry mousse, forest berries jelly and a trio of pistachio wonderment of sponge, glaze and bavarois. This can only come from the talented hands of @chef_pang ... Every mouthful of joy and delight perfectly encapsulating the beauty of summer :)\n<br />#summer #dessert #pistachio #mousse #forestberries #raspberry #beautiful #immaculate #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #antoinettesg

Then look to the culinary prowess of Chef Pang from @antoinette_sg for his amazing rendition of a Nordic smorgastarta inspired cake with light rye bread as cake layers。
Happy hatch day Antoinette! \n<br />Go revel in festivities with the sugar daddy\'s and indulge in a delightful smorgasbord of pretty plates that incidentally are super BIG on flavor too！
{Braised Beef Cheek, Potato Purée, Port Jus} - a melt-in-the-mouth chunk of meat which flakes apart with little resistance at the ends of the fork. Dip it in the moat of rich port jus for good measure。
Basically, a sandwich cake filled with everything I love! 😍 and one that I\'m sure any non-dessert loving Father would be happy to tuck into. \n<br />#eatoutsg #fathersday #instafood_sg #smorgastarta #nordic #savourycake #antoinetteSG #onthetable #foodstagram #foodevangelist #foodporn #cakecakecake #burpple
I must say Antoinette does their cakes really well though. They are not only pretty but tasty too. Antoinette is a cake with an earl grey biscuit encased in a milk chocolate mousse. The biscuit could do with slightly more earl grey taste. But other than that, it was perfect. I like how it\'s not too sweet, the sweetness is just nice.
A balanced of zest and sweetness, which chocolate lovers will adore.
This is definitely made for chocolate-lovers. Warm chocolate sauce, 66% dark chocolate ice-cream, chocolate pieces and vanilla creme make this one heavenly treat. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg

as many may know, antionette is open by the chef pang who previously worked for canele. I love the \' princessy n royal\' concept of the various antionette outlets. feel so tai tai when I stepped into it! Haha. Anyway, back to food. Tried their mains and I don\'t really like it. I would recommend you guys to try their dessert! They have a few cakes that are not bad and my fav is antionette (earl grey chocolate cake)!! macarons was a little too sweet tho and has a strong almond after taste. 
Another nicely crafted dessert from antionette. If u r a fan of rosé, u will love it!
