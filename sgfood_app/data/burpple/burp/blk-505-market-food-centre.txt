The ingredients are different, it contains carrot, spring onion, lettuce, fried wanton skin, imitation abalone which they replace for raw fish.\n<br />I love the sweet and sour taste which is very appetizing. It would be better if they replace the wanton skin to those crackers we add on the yusheng. 9.5/10
One of my favourite eat within this hawker.
Remembering our childhood memory.

The pork chop were not too oily and breaded with flavour while the cabbage and egg were great to have with the amount of curry gravy added into the rice!
