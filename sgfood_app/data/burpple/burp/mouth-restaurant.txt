1) Chilled $ Sliced Fresh Abalone\n<br />2) Lobster &amp; Mixed Seafood Soup\n<br />3) Braised Stuffed Sea Cucumber\n<br />4) Deep Fried Fish Fillet with Mushroom Sauce\n<br />5) Fried Rice with Fresh Crabmeat &amp; Fish Roe\n<br />6) Birdnest Caramel Custard Pudding
6-course Gourmet Set Meal at Mouth Restaurant (@mouth_restaurant) , seriously unbelievable at only $36.80++ per pax (min 2). Amazingly worth it!
Perfect combination. Where do you think has the best liu sha bao?
Ok. I was told by the boss, people who knows how to eat this don\'t let the \'gold\' flow out. So the next time you wanna take photo of Mr Liew, don\'t let it flow to your whole plate.  For this shot, I didn\'t waste an oz of gold. 😂
The pastry is the soft crusty like Tim Ho Wan style, yet inside it\'s real butter (not margarine) salted yolk lava. You should try this!
They are echinoderms. (A marine biologist from NUS told me before) The sea cucumber at this resto has a nice and firm texture (soft and yet firm as they are not chemically soaked till it\'s soft). Something grandmamas and mamas will painstakingly do during CNY. Sea cucumber is not about being soft, but the correct mouth phil when you eat it. Do you agree? The ones here got it quite correct. Fish maw (square thing in photo) is nice too.
The yummy on the skinny - rocketing cholesterol levels with the immensely fingerlicking good roe. #foodporn #mouthrestaurant
Quite a heavy pork taste but still retains crisp on the skin. Recommended to go with their homemade sauce.
Finally tried their baked Liu sha bao and it is really yummy.

Was expecting a steam one but had a stir fried one. Unexpected surprise!
Crabmeat Spinach Soup with Steamed Egg White. Very unique, isn\'t it?
Liked the spiciness of the gelatinous chicken feet
Nothing special at all don\'t get this
Very very soft and gelatinous
😍 SO FLOWY and so generous with the salted egg custard!! 😋👍\n<br />.\n<br />#sundaydimsumbrunch #DAMNGOODPLS
And did u know sometimes alittle squid ink is used to replace salt when cooking certain foods like pasta? \n<br />This is squid ink char siew pau which i tarpau home. Not as fluffy as the white ones but taste just as good. Cos the ink has a natural saltyness, the pau has a tad salty flavor but not overpowering. \n<br />#charsiewbuns #chinese #teabreak #i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #hungrygowhere #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igsg #igers #instafoodsg #instafollow #foodspotting
The sweetness of the ice cream blanketed the somewhat bland paste. More gimmicky than a \"sweet\" dessert. \n<br />However my eagerness and my appetite was marred by bouts of coughing by a service staff who (sorry to say this) did not cover her mouth. The reason why I did not finish the dessert as prolly the germs were circulating around. @mouthrestaurant\n<br />#desserts #dessertlovers #i8mondays #whati8today #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igers #igsg #instafoodsg #instafollow #mouthrestaurant

// despite the slightly disappointing results of some minor tweaks to the recipe, these were still golden 😍 ~ I proceeded to lick that finger after this shot was taken.

Wondering what would Sanbei beef or pork turn out to be??
Mouth Restaurant launches the Rich Man\'s version aka Treasure Pot Feast which consists of 9 different dishes eaten separately// 相信大家对传统的“盆菜” 一点也不陌生、但是您可曾听过 “九大簋盆菜” ？ 虽然 [簋] 和[鬼] 同音，但它其实是中国广东传统的吉祥菜。据说贫民吃盆菜，而较富裕的家庭吃的就是九大簋盆菜。这次地茂馆推出了“九大簋套餐” 、前四道分别为上海清蒸大闸蟹、街头碗仔翅、怀旧窝貼虾、月滿抱琵琶
Who can resist???
This is my first hairy crab in my food journey.
