Love the ambience of this little hideout, seafood was reasonably priced..spent ard $145 for 5pax. Will be back for more yummy seafood for sure:)
It\'s always a messy affair when eating Louisiana-style seafood. The fresh catch (crab, prawns, clams and mussels), corn and sausages are cooked in a cajun spice mix and served in a bag or on the table. This form of seafood boil is slowly making waves in Singapore as huge crowd flocks to such restaurant to have some finger lickin crustaceans.
Ever heard the saying that food tastes better when you eat it with your hands? Damn right it is. We weren\'t really sure how we were gonna eat it at first. From the bag? Do we pick the seafood that calls out most to us from the bag? But what if the one we really want is at the bottom of the bag? And then we realized that the tables around us emptied their bag\'s entire content onto the table. OHHH. That\'s really the best way to savour this beautiful and delectable mess of seafood goodness. üòåüòå
Interesting ang moh goreng pisang dessert with coconut ice cream n durian fritters.
A fun and unjudgy concept of eating seafood at @theboilersg! Check out my thoughts on fatassbean.wordpress.com!
I foresee repeat visits. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com. Active link in bio!
üë∂ Had to put a serviette underneath to make the wordings show! Hahaha! \n<br />More pictures from #theboilersg up in awhile!
Head down to the Boiler. And don\'t miss the live Boston lobster promotion that ends tmr!!! Full story on blog.
(Get it? Haha) But... That won\'t happen coz it\'s so finger licking good. The spicy sauce is quite shiok. @thehungrycow beside me said if there\'s \'chor bee hoon\' thrown in to soak up the leftover sauce, we would be in carbo heaven!
It\'s a nice bag of crab, prawns, bratwurst, mussels, clams and corn simmered in a nice creamy and garlicky sauce. Yummy! 
New start up by a bunch of friends. Expect to use your hands, get messy but devour scrumptious fresh seafood done Louisiana-Style. Choice of Dungeness Crabs, Boston Lobster, Mussels, Shrimps, Clams or just go for all in the Bombdiggity Bag. You ought to make reservations as it is packed. Parking is a breeze
What an upsetting month it\'s been. I\'ll be glad when everything is over.\n<br />.\n<br />#xtieinsg #cafehop #cafehopsg #cafelife #igsg #foodstyling  #foodspotting #foodfeed #hungrygowhere #foodspottingsg #burpplesg #timeoutsg #foodie_features #burpple

Good things must share. Our Seasonal Brown Crabs are back after a 9-months hiatus. Packed with so much crab roe and sweet flesh, these babies are definitely not to be missed. What\'s more, these brown crabs will be at a promotional rate of $49 each, instead of the usual $72. So go ahead and treat daddy, because we know you love him. See you in a bit! (Promotion valid whilst brown crab last.)
