I’m a sucker for eggplant dishes and if you’re too, please get this! Grilled and peppered with that secret chili seasoning powder used in all their BBQ items, the result’s a melty soft textured eggplant elevated with a nice smokiness and a tame kick of spice. Just in case you can\'t find it in their thick menu books, this dish number is 3009. #BurppleSGLateNight
We tried a few skewers from the huge range they offer and they were all great, except for the chicken head (Head of a Dog than the Tail of a Lion 鸡头 $1, dish number: 2022) that I was too afraid to try! The skewers and BBQ items here are all dusted with a slightly spicy seasoning that helped to elevate the flavours much more and I don’t know what they use but it’s SO addictive! Some we tried were the Garlic Moss 蒜苔 - $1 dish number: 3002, Kelp 海带 - $1 dish number: 3012, Streaky Pork 猪五花肉 - $0.90 dish number: 2006 and Pigs Hearts 猪心 - $0.90 dish number: 2008. #BurppleSGLateNight
Have never really been a huge fan of pig ears but this salad here changed it. Thin crunchy strips of pig ears tossed in a super addictive savoury sauce with cucumber and carrots. This also went really really well with another Ma La dish we had, perfect to cool down the tastebuds! Just in case you can\'t find it in their thick menu books, the dish number is 5012. #BurppleSGLateNight
This. This is how you should start or end a night. Chomping on these amazingly crispy, almost juicy deep fried pigs intestines from 好再来. 👅💦💦
One of their more accurate Chi-Eng translations, this pig\'s ear salad was the perfect companion to all dem spices, mala and cumin coming out of the kitchen. 👅💦
After you\'ve experienced the hilarity of northern Chinese menus, you\'ll soon know to trust the photos instead of the names. When we first walked past this place, we were on our way to eat somewhere else. But since it was so packed and it smelt so good, we knew we had to come by for a second dinner. Eggplants are my weakness, so this photo was enough to entice me despite the name \"the tomato\". Roasted till melting, silky smooth texture and topped with leeks and dusted with chili powder, this is a must-order! So good we ordered one more.
For part two of dinner tonight, our little group of #foreverhungry Burpplers ventured in to the quirkily-named Chinese eatery: \"Good Come Again\".\n<br />With its errr.. interesting decor and menus filled with laugh-out-loud, lost-in-translation items, I really felt like I was back in Xishuangbanna. \n<br />Anyway, about the above dish.\n<br />Our chopsticks were a blur as we attacked the heap of deepfried pig intestines. Not only were they grease-free and perfectly crunchy, but also addictively salty and deeply aromatic from the liberal use of Sichuan spices. There were strips of celery thrown in as well, almost as if to help alleviate the guilt of enjoying this sinful dish a little too much. But I have to say, it was really good to intersperse each bite of the rich intestine with some crisp, fresh vegetable.\n<br />Oh, and nothing beats a \"Lao Te\" beer to wash it all down.
These were deep fried to perfection! Not oily at all yet shatteringly crisp, this dish was so well balanced with the sliced celery. Loved loved loved the mild Sichuan pepper sensation and the lovely fragrance of the whole thing. The delicate-ness of this dish shows off the skill of this place - seemingly unrefined food executed to perfection.
Besides the oddly-named \"The Tomato\" (which is really a roasted egg plant served piping hot), the other that we had at this character-filled joint was a chilled one.\n<br />This version came dressed in light soya sauce and buried under a tonne of raw garlic, chillies and fresh herbs, which of course, ensured its instant popularity.
Ok I\'ll admit I can\'t remember what they were called exactly on the menu, but you\'ll figure it out when you browse. The seasoning on their skewers are spot on, this was true for their mutton ones as well. Classically salty, redolent of cumin and red chili pepper, these were grilled till crispy and served piping hot, a perfect match for ice cold Lao Te beer 🍻
\"The Tomato\".\n<br />Yes, believe it or not, in the menu, that\'s the name this eggplant goes by. Regardless, I am pleased to report there was no identity crisis in terms of taste.\n<br />Completely infused with a sultry smokiness from having been grilled, the soft, mushy eggplant came smothered in spring onions, fresh coriander and the fragrant dried chilli spice powder that\'s popular in North-Eastern China. The outcome was absolutely fantastic.\n<br />@iamjaynedoe and I couldn\'t stop ourselves from ordering another to share before we waddled out of the restaurant.
At \"Good Come Again\", a North-Eastern Chinese eatery in Geylang, I ate pig ears prepared in a style I haven\'t had before.\n<br />Sliced into thin strips, the crunchy cartilage were tossed with julienned cucumber, some carrots and sesame seeds in a mildly spicy dressing to create a refreshing salad. It was a big hit with all of us.
Aside of the super thick skin, the dumplings have loads of meat inside, making it really worth it for the bucks. However, the fillings can be more well-seasoned with some garlic. Nothing really special about this, but still enjoyable.
.\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: Bacon... how can one live without bacon, that is something I’d never understand. The aroma taunts you even before you order it, smoky barbecued streaky bacon wrapped with enoki mushrooms that’s delicious and full of umami. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />No matter how much hope we have lost in the world, never give up because we still have bacon. Years ago we had Johnny Cash, Bob Hope and Steve Jobs. Now we have no Cash, little Hope and no Job. Please God Please, at least let us keep Kevin Bacon. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #GoodComeAgain #bacon #enoki #mushroom #skewers #bbq #meatshow
Underdogs look like this. Like the average joe but creep up on your taste buds when you least expect it. \n<br />Well seasoned oily lettuce leaves slightly spiced with dried chilies and a tad of sesame oil. We kept going at it till its all gone and then wanted some more. More is always good. \n<br />#FTrecommends
Add the fact that this was Deep Fried, Cleaned Properly (I assume &amp; certainly hope so) Fried masterfully with Si Chuan Chili Peppers for that Fragrance &amp; Numbing sensation which was Honestly Sublime along side Celery which acts as a palate cleanser. It burns so good until the next when one is on their Throne. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEXPLAINS💮: For Thousands of years, the Chinese have been perfecting their local cuisine from individual provinces, what you get here is of that experience. 🀄️\n<br />Bear with the noise which is part of the beauty anyways, drink &amp; talk to the people, which one actually finds joy through food. And that to me is just of the Beauty of Food. 干杯 🍻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodiesg #sgfood #singaporefoodie #eatbooksg #discoversg #foodpornsg #sgeats #foodsg #instasg #theartofplating #chefstalk #worlds50best #asia50best #gourmetartistry #FRavorites #feedfeed #chefsofinstagram #thenewhealthy #fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg
Late night wacky skewers. Like pigs hearts and \"head of a dog than the tail of a lion\" that turned out to be chicken heads. They have this delicious seasoning that they use to marinate all their items for grilling. It is definitely worth a try and enjoy all the wacky variety! #burpplesglatenights
