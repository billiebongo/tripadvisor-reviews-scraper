@milkandhoneygelato has up their game by serving something different from the usual buttermilk waffle, here are the donut waffles topped with gelato. The texture is chewier and with a crispy exterior. They have five choices for you to choose: Mud Ball Pie, Berry Malt, Peanut Butter Jelly, Banana Crumble &amp; Mango Cheese(not in pic). Price ranged from $5.90 to $6.20, pretty affordable!
Featuring here are their Poached Eggs which have 3 choices for you to choose from - Eggs Benedict, Eggs Florentine and Eggs Royale. Reasonably priced and eggs were perfectly poached.
At $10.80, it comes with a triple stack buttermilk pancakes served with caramelized bananas, strawberries, honey comb candy and whipped cream.
.\n<br />Delicately plated peanut butter gelato topped on donut waffles filled with love, we applaud @milkandhoneygelato for their gracious act of supporting students with autism disabilities.\n<br />.\n<br />One of the amazing artwork displayed there is \'The Rainbow Jellyfish\'. At many times we tend to forget how fortunate we are and It\'s definitely heartening to see cafe showing support for the less fortunate.\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @milkandhoneygelato for hosting and @rachaelwong for the invitation.
You can either opt for the smoked salmon ($13.80), bacon &amp; ham ($12.80) or spinach ($11.80) option. Each set comes with their signature donut waffle, gratinated hollandaise sauce and a side salad.
There\'s pie, waffles, liquid chocolate, crushed cookies and a vanilla cream, all on one single plate. This will definitely satisfy the sweet tooth in you.
Choose between eggs Benedict, eggs Florentine and eggs Royale all served with a doughnut base.\n<br />#MilkAndHoneySG
Caramelised bananas, honeycomb and fluffy pancakes ($10.20).\n<br />#MilkAndHoneySG
Donut-waffle(dowaffles?) stuffed with banana bits, super crispy and delicious!\n<br />Topped with smoked salted caramel ice-cream and salted caramel sauce! \n<br />What more can I ask for?
.
Yes guys, rid your usual mainstream eggs ben, this is wonut hybrid we\'re talking about 💕 Also, expect your poached eggs to be cloaked with a silky creamy gratinated hollandaise, I couldn\'t finish everything due to the massive portion (even double-checked the price 😂), but the sauce was irresistible!\n<br />P.S. This was part of their new brunch menu &amp; it\'s currently exclusive to their outlet at Home Team NS (Bukit Batok).\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks Clarence &amp; @milkandhoneygelato for hosting us and 🙆🏻 @rachaelwong for the kind invitation!
If you\'re a chocolate lover, this will definitely not disappoint you. What\'s more, you get to indulge your chocoball with more hot choco fudge bath for an even more chocolately taste 🍫😋
This was probably my favourite out of the two; the Donut Waffle sits atop a pool of Vanilla sauce with a scoop of Cookie Monster gelato on the top. Donut Waffle was served fluffy and not too dense, while carrying a whiff of buttermilk aroma within. Cookie Monster is one of the best sellers of Milk &amp; Honey Gelato, which is churned using cookies hence tasted much like chocolate cookie dough, while the vanilla sauce helped balance out the flavours. The simplest looking Donut Waffle out of the five, but a combination that is a classic and definitely works.
One of the new items available at Milk &amp; Honey Gelato; the Donut Waffle which comes in five variations of flavours. This would appeal to the berry lovers, for the cubes of strawberries beneath and the tuille that carried bits of strawberry carried the tart flavour. Donut Waffle wasn\'t too dense; chewy and fluffy with a crisp exterior and a whiff of buttermilk flavour, while topped off with a mix of two flavours of ice-cream, Balsamic Strawberry and Salty Malty to create a flavour similar to Strawberry Cheesecake.
Apart from desserts and ice-cream, Milk &amp; Honey does serve a variety of salads and sandwiches for those who are looking for savoury food. Foccacia is all baked in-house, and carried a light and fluffy texture that leaves you space for all that ice-cream afterwards while it is filled with sous vide chicken; succulent and lightly marinated for a savoury touch together with capsicum and onion replicating elements found in a Yakitori stick. The sauce and shredded seaweed both adds an umami factor to the sandwich, and a pretty unique sandwich with a rare Japanese touch.
BUT it\'s definitely overrated. So much for the hype.If you are looking for something to cool you off, ilaoilao would be a better choice plus you get some change back. [$8.8 V.S $6.9] 😂
A great way to end the night.
I\'ve followed M&amp;H since 2013, from their humble beginnings at Bedok. 2 years on, their waffles are still as consistent as day one, complete with a delicious buttery flavour and an earful crunch to boot. It\'s perfect on its own, even better topped with a scoop or two of their signature gelatos.
😍 Love their yoghurt parfait choices and toppings, definitely a better option than Llaollao in my opinion - Earl Grey macaron, Ferraro Brittle sauce , Almond tulle, Oreo &amp; Honey Almond Granola 🍨 #milkandhoney_sg #burpple
ANOTHER GEM IN THE WEST (BUKIT GOMBAK) THEIR HONEYCOMB WITH MADAGASCAR VANILLA IS THE BOMB TOPPED ON WARM FLUFFY WAFFLES IS A YUMMILICIOUS COMBINATION 
Best combi for anybody that like coffee, waffles and a fuse of alcohol.. 😋
Coffee is brewed by Toby Estate\'s blends, but its quite liquid here. It has a light fruity body but it\'s pretty standard so to speak.
Milk &amp; Honey has since expanded to their second outlet at Bukit Batok, offering sandwiches, cakes, tarts and plated desserts. Their Sticky Date Pudding comes with a small scoop of vanilla ice-cream at the side, and the warm pudding does a well contrast with the cold ice-cream. It\'s sweet, and fluff pudding makes for a comforting treat.
White Chocolate with Toasted Macademia nuts. Admittedly the White Chocolate wasn\'t quite pronounced in this flavour, but what made it pretty much decent was the toasty Macademia chunks that had its nuttiness spread all over the ice-cream.
Milk &amp; Honey had since expanded into their second outlet ever since their first one at Bedok, and now offers tarts, cakes, sandwiches and plated desserts apart from ice-cream. Meringue was aired out after torching which left it rather dry but surprisingly addictive due to it being a crisp sugary layer over the tart. Overall the tart pastry wasn\'t too hard, and the Passionfruit was lightly tart maintaining a bit of sweetness inside as well.
Price: $10.80

Its their new creation inspired by the all-time favourite Ondeh-Ondeh!\n<br />.\n<br />My aunty instinct told me to pay for it first while waiting for my friends to arrive.  Lucky I did just that since its the last shiny loud bright green piece of thing in the dessert display.\n<br />.\n<br />The Ondeh-Ondeh Cake was made with salted Coconut Bavarian cream (I don\'t know what\'s that but its darn yummy), salted Gula Melaka sauce (there was too little though), kaya and a sweet sable base (French thin butter cookie).\n<br />.\n<br />The overall combination felt like eating a smooth salted caramel icecream that does not melt.  Generally it was sweet but not overly so and I would love to have another serving anytime.\n<br />.\n<br />#ondehondeh #pandan #kayak #sable #gulamelaka #burpple  #SGParentBloggers  #instafood #instafoodie #instagood  #sgigfoodies #foodporn #foodaddict #whati8today #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgigers #foodcoma #nomnomnomnom\n<br />#foodshare #instadaily #sgfoodunion #yumyum #tastyshoutouts #delicious #foodpics\n<br />#hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #openricesg #sgmakandiaries

To be priced like that, I find their desserts berry worthy indeed.

Slightly overpriced for its portion as compared to llaollao (similar froyo but lighter in texture) but I really enjoyed their handcrafted toppings! Though I can\'t help wishing that supermarkets could start selling froyo instead.\n<br />#lifeisdelicious #burpple #openricesg #pickatsg #eatoutsg #milkandhoney_sg
