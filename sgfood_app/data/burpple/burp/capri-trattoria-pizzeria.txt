🍝 •\n<br />We capped off the meal w Capri\'s Torta al limone, a homemade lemon cake with a side of cream. Don\'t be deceived by the simplicity of it, it tasted heavenly for its dense, buttery texture, infused w subtle tang of lemon zest. And I can\'t think of any lemon cakes out there that beat this. 🙈
[Tagliere Casereccio S$28] - a pretty dish from Calabria, Southern Italy of cured cold cuts (pork neck, pork belly &amp; air-dried beef) served atop rocket salad and accompanied with soft or aged cheeses, olive oil, olives, cured chilies &amp; sundried tomatoes. All meats are cured in-house!
Simple things, when done well, can be the most captivating. This dense, moist homemade lemon cake served with a dollop of silly lemon cream is a prime example of that. It\'s homely, rustic, but oh-so-satisfying.
Especially southern Italians. 📢Interesting fact #2 - I can\'t stop thinking about Capri Trattoria &amp; Pizzeria\'s awesome bread! 📢Interesting fact #3 - this Gamberi e cappesante alle erbe is not just photogenic, but so appetizing too! \n<br />Anyone here from Italy? 😊 #capritrattoriasg
The rain is absolutely beating down right now – on a day on which I have to run around Singapore doing media deliveries 😩 – and all I want to do is hole up at the cosy Trattoria Capri and dig into this massive bowl of fish stew. The rich broth comes jam-packed with a multitude of seafood: mussels, clams, prawns, squid, fish, and crayfish.
Here is the panna cotta, and this is after lemon cake and ice cream!
Prawns and scallops seasoned in Mediterranean herbs, pan-seared in olive oil, served on a bed of mesclun, sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Extremely photogenic!
Cannarozzi allo zafferano, a large wide tube pasta, cooked to al dente before sautéed in saffron sauce and served with two kinds of bacon, smoked and crispy.
THIS IS LIKE PREFECT FOR THE WEATHER!😌😋 Even better when paired with the super good homebaked bread! 👍🏻\n<br />Capri Trattoria &amp; Pizzeria is easily one of my fav Italian restaurant now. Lovely food and awesome company makes the experience even better. 😌😌 Ps: don\'t be surprised if the owner offers you dishes that are not on the menu, he\'s just so enthusiastic and passionate about sharing good food!👍🏻😋 #capritrattoriasg
Today I visited a spicy side of Italy. Not many people knew (neither do I) that the Europeans actually offer some spicy dishes. Say for instance, the Arrabiata recipe but this is so much better than the typical Arrabiata. I enjoyed a pleasant burn with an abundance of difference in taste.
I generally refrain from ordering pasta as it\'s something that can be cooked much cheaper and better in general at home, but my instinct told me to make an exception at Capri, and am I glad I did. Beautifully cooked linguine coated in a richly flavoured light tomato sauce, the subtle aroma of shellfish and a mild heat laced through it. The crab meat - delicate, sweet and fresh. When a simple classic is done well, it truly sings.
This was amazing. At first I didn\'t want it as it was said to be light tomato base, but it turned out to be genuinely light! It was more oil-based than tomato based, and the taste was strong but not sweet at all. The clumps of crabmeat were still intact unlike some others which have them minced to bits you can\'t even detect them. The pasta was chewy and had a really smooth texture. The portion was just right for one person as well, full but not uncomfortably full. 
Am really thrilled that there\'s such a brilliant Italian restaurant near the boyfriend\'s place. This heaping plate of homemade fettuccine is sure to satiate any growling tummy with its rich, cream sauce speckled with black truffles, and tossed with bits of pork sausage and walnuts. 
This crabmeat linguine stands out from other tomato sauce and tomato-cream based versions with a seafood stock, teeming with the briny taste of crab. Ultra-rich,  flavourful, and generously laden with crabmeat. 
Delicious Italian black coffee
The spicy tomato sauce was splendid. Fried calamari was slightly better than fried prawns. Overall 8/10.

Not too jerlat! If they just had bigger chunks of crabmeat, I think I would have a tough decision deciding which crabmeat pasta ( this or Valentino) I prefer haha. 😋 TGIF!
Capri trattoria is great. We tried quite a few dishes and they all hit the spot like only homecooked Italian food can: with style, warmth, love and consistency.
Tagliata di Manzo ala Rosmarino // Grilled Grain-fed Ribeye Beef with Mixed Salad &amp; Roasted Potatoes ($34++)
Ravioli Al Nero de Sepia // Homemade Squid Ink Ravioli with Seafood &amp; Mascarpone Cheese ($25++)
Finished off with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and sundried tomatoes, this was a refreshing dish to begin with.
Wonderful! :)\n<br />#italianfood #seafood #mediterranean #sgfood #foodporn #capritrattoriasg #burpple
At Capri, owner Fabrizio exemplifies that classic philosophy to the fullest, and throughout our dinner, regaled us with his stories and his utter love for food and wine. A priceless dining experience, and I will be back for more :)\n<br />#curedmeats #italianfood #foodporn #sgfood #burpple #capritrattoriasg
Really large but it was thin so it was still finish-able. The melted cheese was so moist and juicy I\'m definitely coming back for more. 
Amazing home made pasta texture. Savory sauce. 10/10
