First try on this unique sushi concept and I love how you get to choose your own ingredients!!! There were many options to choose from and we had 2 megansans with 2 canned drinks for $21. Definitely gonna eat them again! They have salads options too:)
Great salad, able to customize what you want. Affordable pricing from 7.90 onwards
Just for fun üòÑBig San salad ($9.90) from my favourite Maki San üòô and an ayataka green tea (extra $1) hiding in the corner. Someone at Maki San seems to forget toppings though, cos it\'s the second time I had something missing! Then I was given a good handful of shredded chicken so yay üòç glad I didn\'t order a Mega San cos I was full halfway through üòÑ
Generous portion at a very affordable price. Btw, @rollwithmakisan is on @sugar_singapore mobile app!
$9.90 a serving, healthy brown rice wrapped with traditional nori ( seaweed), filled with Tamagoyaki ( Japanese Omelette ), Avocado, Steamed Ebi ( Prawn ), Ebiko ( Prawn Roe ), Tempura Enoki Mushroom, Grilled Unagi ( Eel ), Bonito ( Japanese Fish Flakes ), and Garlic Aioli. Tastes filling, crunchy, grainy and creamy.
Here to \'eat clean\' after my yoga session and decided to try their salads for a change. What sets Maki-San apart from other salad outlets would be their choice of toppings. Here in my Big San, I have grilled egg plants, roasted mushroom, Caramalized sweet potato, sweet corn, boiled eggs, tempura enoki mushroom, chicken floss and a dash of sesame sauce (: okay not the healthiest salad, but definitely one of the most interesting of selections out there. One thing though, I\'d have enjoyed for a bigger portion for its price. 
$9.90 for the large ones which are totally filling and tasty!!! You can choose up to 3 essentials, 1 sauce, type of topping for $9.90 or little-san for about $7.90? There\'s also salad sold and you can customize them!!! 
I like the texture of their cold soba, and it\'s only $11.90 for such a generous portion.
I went with the little-san $7.90, you get to pick \n<br />1 wrap (seaweed or healthy soy +$1)\n<br />1 rice  (japanese white rice or healthy brown rice)\n<br />3 essentials (avocado, steamed ebi, ebiko aka prawn roe)\n<br />1 sprinkle (tempura crunch)\n<br />1 house sauce (japanese caesar
I enjoyed the maki. The tempura crunch was a good choice and it was very crispy instead. The prawn roe was rather fresh and the prawns were fresh and crunchy. The brown rice was also a nice healthy touch to the maki so I rarely see japanese maki with brown rice.
I just love the concept at Maki-San as you get to choose the combination of ingredients that you like for your sushi roll. Mine contains mushroom, tamago, bonito flakes, prawn roe, prawns, unagi, picked cucumbers with Japanese ceasar mayo. \n
What is better than your own customized sushi? In a rush? No worries! Maki san provides their own app so you can order beforehand and collect when you\'re there.
Healthy (sort of, if you choose the ingredients healthily) and awesome (because I don\'t have to pick out stuffs that I don\'t eat/like). 
Customized salad and sushi!
I guess... I will never be sick of this!
There is a huge variety of ingredients and sauces for you to choose from. \n<br />These are what I chose - brown rice with hard boiled eggs, boiled prawns, roasted mushroom and cheddar cheese sauce wrapped in nori seaweed. #makisan
iPhone users should definitely place their order via the Makisan app to enjoy 20% discount!!!! 
In fact, it doesn\'t even resemble a salad and actually looks more like a flower!
You get to choose you own ingredients in this salad. Strangely , my salad is void of vegetables since I choose all the fruit options .
Grabbed a Mega San ($9.90) which comes with a wrap, rice, 5 essentials, a special, sprinkle and choice of house sauce. Did you know that you have an option to fry your sushi here? It\'s a top up of $1.50 (for Cathay outlet 12-5pm and seaweed wrap only).
The one rabbit bought was wrapped with brown rice, egg, cucumber, salmon and tobiko. \n<br />Nutty flavor from the brown rice turned out pretty good with the rest of the ingredients. However, I couldn\'t tasted the fatty salmon which was overpowered by others. \n<br />S$10 for this wrap. You be the judge. \n<br />Maki-San\n<br />The Cathay, 2 Handy Road #B1-17/18 Singapore 229233 (Dhoby Gaut MRT), Tel:+65 6737 8772\n<br />Opening Hours: 11:30am ‚Äì 9:30pm Daily

DIY to create your perfect sushi! We chose salmon, mushroom, cheddar cheese, tuna and bacon for a combination which turns out to be a great delight. For $12, you get a 9-piece fried sushi roll with a drink. Pretty worth it for a quick fix near town! 
If you do not know what is makisan sushi about. You can actually choose the fillings inside and also the rice type, either brown rice or normal rice. #vscocam #vsco #food #iphoneonly #foodie #sushi

Spicy mayo and tempura bits go really well together üòçüòçüòç the hard boil egg and corn really didn\'t go so well.. at all. 
You can customise your own sushi just like subway. \n<br />It is abit pricey, about $10 but it is worth trying

Packed in my maki roll were tamago, ebi, kani, unagi, avocado and ebiko. Instead of the usual nori, I opted for the egg crepe as my choice of wrap. \n<br />My friend made good decisions with the curry sauce and tempura eniko which were very good! \n<br />#beatricewandertales #thefeedfeed¬† #vscofood #burpple #openricesg #f52grams #onthetable #hungrygowhere¬†#foodstagram #eatoutsg #foodporn #foodie #foodgasm #tagsforlikes #singapore #igsg #sgig #foodpics #foodphotography #japanese #brunch #maki #makisan

Sushi can be made healthy too, depending on what you choose!
One of my favourite takeaway store :D just choose all your favourite ingredients and let them do their roll roll magic! Although the soy skin and brown rice make it look non sushi like. I chose salmon sashimi, edamame, corn, pine nuts, egg plant, tamago , Parmesan cheese and filled with yuzu vinaigrette.. Yum!
1st try! - one box @ $8.90 (Price of mine!) tried one of the house specials. :)
Thanks for the invitation to your awesome party! @rollwithmakisan @hayzgal #sgfood

Innovative way to have your maki. Enjoy your roll of self created maki at $6.90 with 3 ingredients and a dressing. Imo it\'s stlightly overpriced for a maki, but would still recommend if you\'ve got a movie to catch and need a quick bite. ^(oo)^
