Love their wall prints and their lovely color combination. Having great time with a bunch of girls. Enjoying sweet stuffs together.
Cutesy 3d latte art at Brew added many Pts to the cup of Goguma latte. Taste is abit too light for my liking. Would recommend their taro latte as an alternative! Do remember to checkout the schedule as the barista is not always around!
At first look, was quite disappointed.. Coz I heard that the latte art is cool... But it came with nothing, nt even a heart..:(.    Once I took a sip! Everything changed. The flavour of sweet potato just covered my whole mouth. The outlook really looks empty burnt got the \"Liao\" inside. Nice.... 
Check their Facebook for the barista\'s schedule. (Taro latte w/ Ariel of The Little Mermaid) üíï #singapore #foodieventure
Visited this newly open Japanese &amp; Korean theme cafe today and was super impress by their absolutely pretty decors such as their white chairs and fences. This sweet potato latte was recommended by the barista and its not too sweet yet delicious and creamy at the same time. Yum! 
But this yam-milicious latte is worth a picture. ‚ù§ Is that taro-ble? üòõ \n<br />#weekend #cafe #yummy #tarolatte #brewmaison #sgfoodstagram #burpple
I find that it\'s too sweet and thick.

Choose the main -üê∑üêÆüêüüê§ then pasta/rice/bread/wrap and finally sauces. Our plate- chicken cutlet/pasta/teriyaki sauce and beef/wrap/curry sauce.
Nice and creamy not overly sweet.

Rabbit forgot to shave.
Not too sweet with a tint of taro fragrance...
The title say it all.. Pork is pork belly. 
Great place to chill with friends
Taste is very light, actually too light for my liking.\n<br />#brunch #burpple #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife #cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeeaddict #coffeegram #coffeeholic #coffeelife #coffeelove #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #instacoffee #lunch #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #latte #brewmaison
