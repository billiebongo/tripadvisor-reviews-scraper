simple meal after last friday\'s class. Chicken Curry w Rice, $3.50ea. curry and chicken was nice, but the potato was not so well cooked tho, still nice as a whole! coffee was only $0.45! so good to be a poly student eh? #lunch #curry #chicken #coffee
French Fries w Spicy Mayo, $1.50ea. erm good for a quick bite if you\'re rushing for lessons, quite okay tho lol. the stall right beside the chinese ramen stall. #lunch btw i\'m sharing this photo onto my new Facebook page, weismakanjourney, look it up, and press like if you like fooood! i\'ll see ya there! #lunch #frenchfries #mayo
im back at this spicy noodles again! Tom Yam La Mian, $2.80ea. was sooo famished after lesson yesterday. doesnt look very presentable but it was good! #lunch makan place have gone through a little facelift, including some of the stalls! #chinese #noodles #tomyam
Kaki fuyong for dinner before dance practice with @neverthinkspeaks! OMG miss this alot!
#chicken #curry rice! #dinner was in the bowl but i decided to take all of it out lol. thanks @nganshuzhen for the carrot lol.
famous amongst Ngee Ann Poly and SIM peeps. kaki fuyong or #chicken #omelette. other choices of prawn or oyster as well. #dinner hadnt have this for sometime tho! $3 onwards.
uber hungry this afternoon. #tomyam #noodles for #lunch yes am addicted :)
the famous kaki fuyong at Ngee Ann Poly. $3 each. Chicken/Oyster/Mixed(extra $1) #lunch #japanese #japfood was super hungry after math class that i took 2 bowls of miso soup.
but for another purpose this time round. since Foodclique at SIM was super packed during the lunch hours, naturally MAKANPLACE became the second choice, nothing can go wrong when you order a set of Kaki Fuyong from the japanese stall here. still the same ol wonderful taste of fried chicken and omelette, from $3. and the sleepy spells came right after i chomped this down. üòÇ bubbletea were from SIM. #lunch #kakifuyong #ngeeannpoly #makanplace #japanese #japfood #omelette #chicken #bubbletea #burpple #whati8today #8DAYSEat

was reluctant to eat this, but since it\'s lunchtime hour and everywhere is packed, i choose feature this. Mixed Veg Rice, or Economical Rice as some would say, cheap, yummy and filling meal for as low as $2.20 for some other places (this cost me $2.90, 2 veg and 1 meat choice)! Sweet &amp; Sour pork, French Beans, Black Pepper Chicken w French Beans! (: now i have Chinese-Malay, Indian, Korean, Chinese kind of rice, what will be my next and last feature? English baked rice? hmmm. üò∂üò∂ #lunch #chinesefood #chinese #meat #pork #ngeeannpoly #makanplace
something like satay sauce but in red. not too bad :) but sadly the egg broke, that\'s very bad :( #lunch #koreanfood #rice #korea #chicken
had a gruelling 9 hours lecture yesterday, this was what i had after 6hours; Cereal Fried Rice from Pines. looks good but sadly it doesnt live up to my expectations. theres sotong and prawns in it, tried a prawn and it\'s not fully cooked. like as though the prawn was soaked into hot water, turned red and pulled it up quickly to serve. luckily the intestines were removed. chili was good and spicy thats all, sigh i seldom give this kind of comments one. #lunch #friedrice #seafood #prawns #makanplace #ngeeannpoly
ok back to noodles, this was what i had 30mins ago. rearranged the vegs and poured spring onions n chili over it hehehe. Roast Chicken &amp; Pork Hor Fun. hor fun is a type of noodles, made from rice. quite yummy, not bad for $4! #makanplace #ngeeannpoly #lunch #chinesefood #chinese #chicken #pork #horfun
this week is noodles week! i wont be eating japanese ramen sorry cos there isnt any nice jap ramen around my school. i shall eat simple and keep choices 
back to the ol-so-familiar Kaki Fuyong once again. the taste never go wrong for so many years, talk about consistency aye? this stall is one of the most consistent one in Makan Place. the lunchtime queue will explain why! Chicken Kaki Fuyong, $3ea. shall go to sleep, 9 hours lecture later omg dang :/ watch out for my 2nd CNY post! #lunch #hotplate #chicken #japanesefood #japfood #kakifuyong #ngeeannpoly #makanplace #egg
? a great way to have your lunch w assorted food! choose any food from the display and the stallholder will cook it for you, accompanied w either noodles, bee hoon, rice etc. dont forget the sweet and chili sauce combo! im surprised that you can add as many soya beans as you want here at the makan place. min 7pc @ $3.20 onwards. #lunch #makanplace #ngeeannpoly #yongtaufoo #ytf #chinesefood #chinese #noodles
Cendol, crushed ice w cendol (the green thing), sweet corn, agar-agar (jelly), grass jelly. a good dish to fight the heat here in Singapore! #dessert #cendol #jelly
Nasi Briyani Ayam anyone? ate this for lunch yesterday. this dish is like jigglypuff\'s hypnotising song, it can knock you out to sleep soon after you ate it lol too much carbo haha $3.50ea. #lunch #nasibriyani #ngeeannpoly #makanplace #muslimfood #indianfood #chicken #curry
