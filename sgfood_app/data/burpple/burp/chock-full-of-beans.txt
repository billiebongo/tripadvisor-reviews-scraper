••\n<br />Cute and pretty 3D art on our Latte. Taste wise it\'s fairly normal, but it\'s worth a try.
The Roast Beef Benedict ($14) is the perfect synergy of pull-apart beef and eggy mess. Their poached eggs reminded me more of onsen eggs, but that means I can spend a good few minutes taking pictures without worrying about the yolk getting hard! Greatly priced but generously portioned (trust me when I say that I had more beef than bread), pairing this dish with a cup of Magic coffee ($5) will surely lift your spirits. \n<br />Opening at 9:30am on weekends, this is definitely a find in the tranquility of Changi Village. Come down early as I hear there will be queues during lunch!
This is as close as it can be before Gudetama gets in own Cafe in Singapore, a 3D latte art of Gudetama! It\'s a good attempt although it looks quite off from the official look. The 3D latte is only available in the cold version of the latte, while the hot version will showcase the typical latte art.
Paid another visit to the cafe during a Sunday afternoon and was surprised by the large number of patrons. There were hoards of pokémon fans swarming the area but we still managed to get a seat luckily. Service was great as usual and we were well informed of the 30min wait for our 3D Latte art. Our drinks were great and we recommend the Baileys latte which was gorgeous. 
One of the best place to chill and get some work done with the cutest companion that made my day! I was a little hesitant to destroy but cray weather= instant gratification with the smooth iced earl grey latte. Would\'ve preferred if the flavour was a little more distinct as the bitterness kicked in after. On a side note, dude next to me got the cutest Snorlax and he looked at it in disdain😂 
The countdown to the weekends begins.\n<br />•\n<br />Chock Full of Beans\n<br />Address: 4, Changi Village Road, Unit 01-2090, Singapore 500004 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #latteart #coffeeart #chockfullofbeans #pokemongo #changivillage #snorlax
Thank you for visiting me and surprising me with my fav rose latte which is not in frame🌹☕️
Gets me so surprised &amp; so addicted to it. The taste of it still lingers in my mind! 😍😋
His is with Vanilla Latte (SGD5 (R) / SGD6 (L)). I didn\'t try his drink, but he said it\'s not bad.
This place is known for its 3D latte art! Almost too cute to drink!
The peppermint leaf was a nice touch to an old favourite!
I like the sleeping bear, becos I\'m always thinking of sleeping during my free time! 😜\n<br />Fyi, no bear is harm in this photo. 😆
Simply love the 3D Art!\n<br />I enjoyed my alcoholic latte throughly that kinda brought me to a slightly high feeling 😅 My younger girl however preferred hers to be less bitter. Tsk tsk, teenage sweet tooth 😁\n<br />🍽\n<br />Strawberry Shortcake ($6.50)\n<br />🍓🍰\n<br />Available only on weekends. Sponge cake layered with chantilly cream and strawberries was heaven 😇 Love the light fluffy sponge cake and the light smooth cream that was not too sweet and overpowering. It would have been perfect if the strawberries were not tiny winy sourlish ☺️\n<br />That little artwork cartoon was exactly our expression when the stubborn Pokemon just whooshed off after several capture attempts 😩 🍓🍰\n<br />#burpple
Been wanting to visit this place to admire their famous 3D latte art. Love the cozy setting &amp; friendly staff. Overall a pleasant dining experience 🙂\n<br />#burpple
🍮\n<br />Available only on weekends. Classic Italian dessert layered with mascarpone cheese, coffee, liquor-soaked ladyfingers, dust with coco powder.\n<br />Honestly, this dessert was a disappointment ☹️\n<br />The last layer was too moist and mushy, the middle was overly filled with thick cream while the top layer was too heavily coated with coco powder. The mixture of soggy &amp; bitter taste was terrible 😩\n<br />To make it worst, the entire presentation with a very coarse &amp; slacky &amp; ugly artwork didn\'t set the right first appetizing impression 🙄\n<br />🍮\n<br />#burpple
🍝\n<br />We asked for non spicy as my younger girl couldn\'t take chilli. The seafood were very fresh and the entire pasta was so yummy that not a strand of spaghetti nor a piece of prawn was spared. Personally, I believe it would taste much better with the spicy version 😋\n<br />🍝\n<br />#burpple
Missing this Bloo iced soda with a cute little Jelly bear which had the consistency of a konnyaku 😂\n<br />To Pokemon trainers, @chockfullofbeans is a pretty good spot 😂 nonstop lures and lots of water Pokemon! 🙌 model : @jellylovefats
Went there for breakfast with friends and got myself a Portobello Mushroom with Eggs Benedict($13) The food was pretty good and filling! Also got their famous 3D art iced latte! The service was excellent &amp; I would visit again!
With the weather blowing hot and cold recently, maybe a cute 3D latte art will brighten up your day? Being one of the pioneer cafes in Singapore, I am glad to announce that their drinks still maintained a certain standard such as the Iced Earl Grey Latte ($6.50), that has the distinct earl grey aroma with the subtle hint of coffee at the back of your tongue. The 3D latte art was the craze back then but since then there have been so many other variations such as rainbow art, selfie coffee art. Nonetheless, I still feel that the 3D latte art has got to be the most photogenic one out of the lot.
Strong brew for a regular Cuppacino. It comes with 2-D art based on the mood of Barista unless you have a preference. Lovely beans.  Verdict: 4/5
Great experience with the 3d Latte art which is only available for iced coffee. For the hot variety, unique latte art can also be expected with cute cartoon characters among many others. Food wise, prices are acceptable with decent quality food. The place is perpetually packed during weekends so do head down earlier to grab yourself a seat. Check out\n<br /> http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2016/06/food-review-chock-full-of-beans-changi.html
($10++) It was like half a battle won when my beautifully plated french toast was served less than 5 minutes from ordering. Simple yet resplendent with fruit garnish, the thick egg toast felt homely. Only drawback was the banal, (I think) probably outsourced (from your nearest super mart) chocolate syrup and whipped cream. \n<br />The reasons why choke full of beans is packed on weekends have to be because of its great service and lower than average cafe food prices. Especially with international names sprouting everywhere charging an average of &gt;$20++ per brunch item. Definitely a must visit if you are around this end of the island.                                   P.s: If you have a free afternoon ahead, go ahead and place an order of their insta worthy 3D-latte art coffees! 
Lovely latte with Baymax latte art!\n<br /> http://slowchomp.com/cute-3d-latte-art-chock-full-of-beans-changi-village/
Cuteness overload! \n<br />http://slowchomp.com/cute-3d-latte-art-chock-full-of-beans-changi-village/
It\'s crazy how everyone get to customize their own cup of latte with their favorite cartoon design. The price is also very affordable. From $6-7. 
Lovely place to chill with free wifi, nice coffee and cute latte art. Seems dog friendly too. The matcha cake was quite average though.
The regular hazelnut latte @ $5 nett came with Baymax latte art which was amusing. The hazelnut latte was smooth but taste wasn\'t exceptional; it was similar to CBTL. We were more surprised by the 3D Baymax that came atop the iced latte @ $6.50 nett. The iced latte was equally smooth but stronger. It\'s a bit of a shame that they don\'t do 3D art on hot coffees. 
There is a well balance of butter, milk and seasonings, giving the scrambled eggs a superb texture and flavourful taste. \n<br />See the full review on Chock Full of Beans at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/03/03/chock-full-of-beans-best-weekend-brunch/
He commented that the eggs were done nicely, just that the Hollandaise sauce is a watered down version.
Recommended this cafe to his friends for the 2D/3D latte art. (Top): Terry\'s Roasted Pork Roulade &amp; eggs (S$16). Tasted pretty normal, baby gave a 6/10 rating. (Left): Baby had Ultimate Swiss Rosti (S$18). Love the rosti with mushrooms and walnut sauce, but it\'s kinda small. Chicken cheese sausages was not too bad, but the scrambled eggs\' a little over-cooked. (Bottom): I had omelette with cheese, ham and mushrooms (S$12). The omelette is over-cooked, I would have preferred a more runny texture. They could also have been more generous with the ingredients.
Rode a bicycle from Pasir Ris Park to Changi Village to have this! Their egg benedicts were pretty great! There was a choice of having 1 or 2 eggs, &amp; i was glad i only ordered one bc I was filling enough! Sister said her wrap was good! She was a very small eater so, her stomach could only fit half of the wrap she was served! Great place to sit there, chill &amp; gossip about everything in life 
Now that they have installed the big yellow spotlight, it makes the lighting yellow. Still loving their strawberry shortcake and rose latte. 😋
A great place for brunch food and simple desserts. The wow factor is their coffee art and they have really cute and wonderful 3D coffee art! You can request the characters you want or have the waiters or waitress decide for you. If you order a slice of cake there is also drawings on the plate served. A cafe that all will love.
Almost too cute to drink, these took as long, if not faster to arrive compared to other \'craft\' coffee cafes, and were just as good to boot. The iced latte($6) was strong and smooth with a distinct coffee flavour that wasn\'t drowned out by the milk or ice. The walnut brownie latte ($6.50) was similarly luscious but enhanced with the judicious use of flavoured syrup that lent nutty, chocolatey caramel notes without being overpowering in the sugar department. Quality was most certainly not compromised in favour of gimmickry.
Pictured is the lunch set at Chock Full of Beans, priced at $16.90. Each pasta set comes with a pasta and a drink (minimum top up of $2 for other drinks, such as my Hazelnut Latte). 
4 munchies: First throwback post to our hawker and cafe-hopping trail with Burpple Tastemakers Julius and Raine in June. I could smell the lovely taro fragrance as soon as my Totoro landed on the table. The 20-minute wait was worth the experience; also if you\'re looking to get a refreshing caffeine fix.
Flat White Coffee S$4.5 comes with biscoff biscuit. Their coffee has this smooth texture of foam at the top and incorporated with latte art. You can request to the staff which kind of design you prefers to put. Nice place to have some coffee break with your friends and they were populary known for their 2D/3D coffee latte art which is really fun to see.
Super adorable deco that comes with my strawberry shortcake. Their coffee art are the best &amp; they taste good too!
A sweet Berry Smoothie to complement the savoury Chock Full of Big Breakfast! Great choices of food here!! (check out my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg for a full review) 
Hello Kitty 3D latte art &amp; Eggs Atlantic. Be sure to order your drink early to avoid a long wait!! (check out my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg for a full review) 
➊ [Flat White S$4.50]
Found this 3D latte art iced coffee with @sugar_singapore ... The coffee essence isn\'t very strong, and that\'s okay for me :) #wewantsugar #chockfullofbeans
Got the one with chocolate sauce and banana. Liked the addition of orange slice on it for a different texture and tangy taste altogether. First bite didn\'t impress, but later on as the chocolate sauce soaked through it became better. Overall toast is too thick, not fluffy enough imo. $9.
Eggs were bland but texture was alright, nothing outstanding but it wasn\'t bad. The rosti was pretty decent with a crispy edge, and I liked the mushroom and its sauce. Portion wasn\'t big but it was very filling for me.
Jigglypuff on a Sunday - too cute! $5.90. Taro taste wasn\'t very strong but the latte was smooth and pretty good overall. 
Cheers to the weekends before booking in again on Sunday and the upcoming 3 day outfield! But first, do drop by Chock Full of Beans if you are in the Changi Village vicinity for some super duper cute latte art on your Iced Latte. Opt for a wide array of characters and if you are lucky, you might even get a 3D latte art such as a Totoro or Baymax, subject to availability. A chilled out laid-back cafe where you can just spend an afternoon there and watch the day zooms by.
Here for lunch with my office BFF hahaha!! Really smooth and strong flat white here, perfect for a TGIF lunch!
This cake came with mixed feelings. Personally I think the mainstream crowd may not enjoy it as much as I did, so I would be as objective as I can. The red beans tasted much like natural beans aka  starchy with a hint of nut. This was balanced off with its matcha cream which had abit of sweetness, and its slightly roasted whipped cream which provided the main sweetness as well as that extra \"oooomph\" from that slight roast on its top. No ratings, cos this would be for the adventurous and the bean lovers. 
The strawberries tasted fresh and natural. It was a good balance of sweet (cake) and sour (strawberries). In fact, they were not stingy with the strawberries, and that belied its simple look. I actually had assumed that there would be more whipped cream than strawberries. Boy was I wrong. Rated 8/10, cos I\'m not a strawberry lover but it made me one for that 10mins. 
Guess everyone must have read about \"Chock Full Of Beans\". Had Eggs Atlantic where thick toast is top with smoke salmon and 2 egg Benedict, paired with a cup of hot Bailey latte. What a wonderful brunch ☺️  
I know Totoro and Baymax will be catching it in 3D (foam art), will you?
I am weirdly excited about the Minions movie, which is opening in cinemas today! I usually do not like to pay to watch an animation in the cinemas, but this shall be an exception. Before that, you can always get your Minions from Chock Full of Beans, which specializes in latte art. My Minion was drawn on a Iced Cafe Latte ($6).
Our favourite chill-out place... Why would you not want to come back here again, and again, and again, and again?
Unbearably cute! We were squealing with excitement when these cuties arrived at our table. Thank you for brightening up our morning!
I also wrote about my experience here: http://nickeatfood.blogspot.sg/2015/03/review-chock-full-of-beans.html?m=1 or click link in my bio (:
$12.90++ set lunch comes with a drink! I loved the generous portion of smoked salmon and cream cheese, but maybe the toasted bread and smoked salmon don\'t gel well! My family rly loves the cute coffee art with a rly decent taste thou!! And their breakfast items!! 
Yay to generous smoked salmon with truly poached eggs (runny egg yolks) and a beautiful latte art (although they were too generous w the hazelnut syrup causing the latte to be a little too sweet).. Haven\'t had a decent brunch in a long time so yummy yay      
Tried @chockfullofbeans\'s dinner menu because we were late for those brunch menu. :/ Overall the pastas were quite disappointing and overpriced. But at least we had our cute coffees!😁 Will be back to try their brunch menu instead. Meanwhile, TGIF~ ☺️
The baristas at Chock Full of Beans certainly know how to put a smile on their customers\' faces with such awesome 3D coffee art. Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Geraldine Tay #Burpple
As mentioned in my previous post, the lunch set consists of either pasta, brunch or sandwiches and comes with either the soup of the day or milk coffee/coffee/tea/iced tea (I think). Good deal for those who live or work around that area. Complete this with a stroll along the beach, you\'ve got yourself a perfect date ;)  
This cafe is well-known for their creative 3D latte art, mine was the Doraemon.   
Decent brunch food. That Bacon isn\'t supposed to be there but anyway, it tastes like bak gua so it depends on how you see it.
😍 I don\'t mind the caffeine overdose, just too cute to resist! #burpple
I\'m gonna hang in there till the arrival of weekends💪
Everything is so cute, do i need to say more after this photo? 
Their food is surprisingly not that bad. Kind of like their sandwiches, though slightly hard. Pair this up with your dose of cuteness (their 3D lattes). Would come back for the weekend brunch! It looks reallyyyy good.
A great place for cakes and cute latte art coffee! Their coffee can be a bit strong :) and the cakes are light, moist and pretty tasty! :) I have tried a few coffees and they are all good! Do note if you want 3D latte art get there before 930pm, else they can only do 2D latte art
This place has the best latte art! And we can\'t bear to drink it for like 30mins?! 😂
😩 I don\'t. I only had a mocha and chicken croissant today. 😔and this picture is here because I\'m craving for some cute latte art to cheer my grumpy belly now!
Back again for their coffee and roasted sandwich.. Still very satisfying. 
ok. they had me with their latte art. coffee was ok, nothing too out of this world or bikini bottom. but sure felt like having second cup to see patrick and then maybe a third to see squidward. wait, i like plankton better. lol
Was around Changi Village and wanted dessert after dinner so yea finally got to visit this little cafe in the corner of CV that\'s just beside the ferry terminal to pulau ubin. The cake is really good. The crust is pure oreo crust. Like wow. And it\'s a baked kind. So interesting. Love the cute choco deco on the plate. Look at that bear!!! Next time I\'m gonna go for their 3D foam art on their coffees hehe. I will try to drink coffee for that! 
Beautiful coffee art. Entertaining and affordable at $4.50 for a regular cappuccino. With excellent service from Joanne and Artisan - John. Great chill out place. 
not de best of weeks but we\'ll pull thru. \n<br />caught a fortune cat by accident.
3D latte art. Available only ice coffee selection. Be prepare for a 30 minutes wait.
$6 a cup. 3D latte art is available for a limited range of drinks.
Smoke duck sandwich, peach sparkling, ice hazelnut latte, potato bacon soup. 
But sorry, not the waffles here 😪
Be prepared to wait 20mins for the 3D ice latte... Nice coffee and food! $7.50. 
So cute!
Awaiting for my 3D art!
Cute 3D latte art but it came with a price, more than 20 mins of waiting time! 
Beef slices could be slightly more. Bread was yummy! My kind of bread 😊
Cheesecake was good! Latte lacked abit of sweetness but those cute cartoons already added enough plus points 😉
Layers of dark chocolate (ganache) &amp; sponge. Good, however as it was served straight out of the fridge (slightly hard), the chocolate flavor was lost.
Visited for the famed 3D latte art, not realizing that only iced drinks comes with 3D. Average coffee; coffee taste was too light.
Generous helping of ordinary smoked salmon. Choice of plain or sesame bagel. Bagel was good; warm and chewy, goes really well with the cream cheese.
Eggs were good and flowy, hollandaise sauce wasn\'t tip top. Sadly Multigrain bread wasn\'t toasted. Generous helping of ham. Bacon, was just bacon.
Of course, caffeine fix ☕️
In a \"not so sleepy anymore\" corner of Changi Village, be entertained with 3D coffee art, and a hippie breakfast menu consisting of the now omnipresent eggs done in various styles. Great chill-out place in the rustic Changi locality. Be prepared to wait for a table
I fell in love after the first sip!
Had the Chock Full of Big Breakfast. It was totally mehhhhh. Wasn\'t to my liking, sausage was a tad too bland too. Didn\'t like the brunch overall. The coffees ordered were cappuccino and flat white. Both were good, really good. At least the coffee made things up. Brunch cost SGD16 and coffees were just SGD5.50! I\'ll personally recommend just have the coffee lah. And if you wanna have the cutesy cutesy 3D coffee art ones, try their iced coffee series. 😊
One of the place I would go for caffeine fix. Food wise, probably not 😅
3D coffee art!
😘 I love bacon and I simply adore mango ~ so this is the perfect sandwich for me!
Spongebob themed rose latte! 
Worth the visit and wait (30mins) for 3D art on request. Drinks superb... food i try next round too full today!
*meowww*
Around 6 bucks for a cuppa latte but I couldn\'t resist after they said they\'d accept my request of having a minion on top. WHY NOT RIGHT?! 
Look Ma, there\'s a smiling cat on my hazelnut latte! 😻😻😻 *meows*
On my coffee egg and toast diet otherwise known as #thebrunchdiet :P #shitmsskinnyfatsays
this cafe never fails to excite me whenever I order my drinks. patiently waiting for my 3dartlatte to arrive.
Chock Full of Big Breakfast ($17) / Banger &amp; Eggs ($17) at Chock Full of Beans. Decent but definitely not a worth value brunch places on my list. Coffees here are still worth a visit! 👌
Looking for unique ☕️ experience? Try the 3D art latte. Pretty amazed by the art. Could make a dull day be happy just looking at the cool 3d effect. 😻😻😻
Hazelnut latte with totoro! You may request your preferred choice of cartoon character to be done on your drink! 
how weekend has ended. love de carbonara pasta here. so yums with the egg yolk
Too cute and very smooth coffee as well! 
Price is reasonable for coffee. Impressive 4D art but was disappointed with the egg Benedict as portion was small and wasn\'t that great 
Had a lot difficulty accessing this area, but had a great time finding a wonderful cafe below a HDB flat; away from the noisy city. 
Pasta was avg. a lil disappointed that the all day breakfast wasn\'t available at 3.30pm when we arrived. Nevertheless, it was still a great experience 
Looking for cute latte experience? Try CFOB. You can get to request your latte art on weekdays! 
May the coming week treat me well!  Good night! Rose latte ♥
The coffee is average but the gorgeous art made up for the novelty factor
Surprisingly 3D latte art is only for iced coffee and you must request it! 
Comes with a multigrain toast, portobello, arugula and egg. Looks small but it\'s filling!
For matcha lover, this is a must try! $5.90 for the hot cup.
Bit of disappointment ... Poached egg is overcooked.. It doesn\'t like the \"flowing\" feel... 
Decided to pop by since I\'m around the area... Was hopping that they can give me a Doremon or smurf( I love my blue and white) ... But y a dog???? Whaha...    Coffee was too thin for me... Somehow the syrup overtake the taste of the coffee completely...    Does all the ppl here come for the coffee or the coffee art? 
Yesterday\'s Date Night. \n<br />➊ [Iced Vanilla Latte S$6.50]
Pak Thor session with hubby. *prevalentine day* Also to destress from work. Why I always get spongebob square pants? Hmm...
caffe latte
Travelled from the furthest west to the far east for this cup of 3D latte art at @chockfullofbeans ! It\'s one of the MUST-go cafes for 2014. Check out the list here: http://www.littletinysun.com/2014/01/7-must-go-to-cafes-in-singapore-for-2014.html?m=1
Coffee overdose. I had to order this when I saw this though I already had a cup of latte earlier. Love the 3D art. 😘😍
Good morning!! Brunch with hubby on the first Saturday of 2014. Love their coffee art. Sponge bob and I am not sure of the other one. Lol. Does anyone know what character is that? Have a great weekend people.
Hope this cuppa latte soothe the cramps a little. Had a horrible morning with horrible cramps. Haven\'t had cramps this bad for a very long time.
The coffee art is pretty and the food is awesome but it is in a land of far far awayyyy..
G tried this and declared he doesn\'t like pesto, I thought this was okay - not fantastic (had better ones!) but not bad. Guess their coffee is better than foooood
(Poor photography skill, beef is hidden HAHA) had the set meal that came with a pretty awesome mushroom soup, sandwich not so good to me. The beef was kinda salty. Liked the multigrain bread tho! Other filling in it were horseradish, parmesan, arugula, sun-dried tomato
Came with set meal (choice of mushroom or pumpkin). Liked their soup! Not too heavy.
Adorable keroppi🐸 in my flat white! Also, the caramelised biscuit was nice! (Selling at 30cents on the side if my eyes didn\'t fail me)
Super yummy caramelised bananas and chocolate french toast for brunch! Coffee was not bad, latte art is wow!
First time I went \"wow!\" when I see coffee.. how gorgeous is this girl!
Pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this sandwich. The wheat bread was toasted to a soft, warm consistency and the crispness of its edges were just right. Generous amount of ham as well. Would have given a 4.5/5 if not for the slightly less fresh salad.
Enjoyed this drink much. Aromatic, refreshing, and topped with adorable Patrick as latte art. 4.5/5
Coffee is decent. Was there for the latte art. Saw some customers getting the 3D Latte Art. Wished they had given me a 3D latte art instead. 
When you fall in love with the person, you don\'t just fall in love with him/her. You fall in love with everything they do and everything that they like.
That\'s some serious #latteart. Last time was doraemon, today is snoppy. Can I have wolverine next? #coffee
Too cute. Awesome latte art
Doesn\'t look as yummy, but it tasted so much better than the ones I had at PS Cafe. The cake is not dry and the cream cheese in the middle is thick enough to go along with the cake.
#throwback to this meal of mine. I need to visit this again. I miss CFOB. \n<br />Happy Sunday Peeps💛
Miffy and Patrick! Really couldn\'t get over their cuteness!!!!! 😍😍 #coffeeart #burpple
Pretty latte art, nice coffee, yummy biscuit, visit there before or after if you are planning to go Pulau ubin. 
Wanted to get myself either an owl or cat but... They say too busy can\'t take any request so randomly I\'ve got this #kon looking character from #bleachanime well... It\'s a another form of kitty hahaha. #hazelnutlatte #burpple #pepperminterfoodadventure
[Rose Latte] S$5.90 - thank you for your efforts and love, barista 👍👍\n<br />There are a lot of Rose Latte around, they are rose syrup+milk. But this is rose flavored coffee! 😌Sweet, nice, rose.
Coffee before lunch with colleagues.  Things you do when you have to go to Changi for a course
A good place for brunch. Never fail to impress me with their coffee art every time I visit them!
Courtesy of chock full of beans ❤ 
Highly recommended
Good match! Perfect way to end the working week! Loving weekends! 
Good Saturday afternoon! Brunching in the east with @joshua_ng today and loving this little corner in Changi Village. Heading off to our next stop soon! :)
😏
Lovely Sunday brunch with cutely designed coffee to keep us awake and refreshed 😋😊🤗 you can choose to add ingredients of your favor to omelette, I chose salmon, bacon, and shiitake mushroom which go very well with eggs 🍳 the coffee is not just pretty, I chose earlgreay flavoured latte and the mixed aroma of tea and coffee was wonderful!🍵☕️ Second time going there and it\'s indeed a popular hangout. It you wanna head over for weekend breakfast, do go there early to get good seats. Though the head barrista may not be there to give you 3D latte art, so try your luck 🥂🤗 #food #goodfood #eat #drink #coffee #cafe #latte #latteart #earlgrey #brunch #eggs #omelette #salad #foody #foodie #foodlover #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodiegram #instafood #instaeat #instagood #instadaily #yum #yummy #delicious #foodilicious #burpple

Ok, that\'s all.
Better than it looks! Nice balance of garlic, salt, chilli and the other ingredients. A little oily overall but still  enjoyable! Guess the food taste better when u have lower expectations! 😛\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#changivillage#chockfullofbeans#seafood#agliooilo#pasta#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Coffee is good and also so impressed with the creative art. I requested for Snorlax and the barista made it for me. Food wise can be better but for the time being - coffee is the only reason for me to come to this place.
Still my favourite starter Pokémon till date.\n<br />•\n<br />Chock Full of Beans\n<br />Address: 4, Changi Village Road, Unit 01-2090, Singapore 500004 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #latteart #coffeeart #chockfullofbeans #pokemongo #changivillage #charmander

Honey Matcha Latte + vanilla latte
Baristas put in a lot of effort to make these cute 2D/3Dlatte art and cake plating, and they deserve a huge round of applause for making them taste as good as they look! I had the regular honey matcha latte which was really rich and not too sweet, and we shared the matcha azuki cake and pancakes! The matcha azuki cake will suit those who do not have a sweet tooth but was a tad too creamy for me, but the panacakes was awesomely fluffy with that warmmmm maple butter syrup. A really worthwhile long bus ride to this ulu place ☺️😋 #burpplesg#burpple#tslmakan#sgcafe#exploresingapore#sgfoodie#whati8today#8dayseat#matcha#matchalatte#matchaazukicake#hazelnutlatte#latte#pancakes#maplesyrup#chockfullofbeans#sgeast#latteart#onthetable#sgfoodsnaps#roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition

Requested for a Totoro on my ice mocha (S$6.50). I love this fat Totoro latte art while baby love the mocha as the coffee\'s intense and rich.
So those who are planning to drop by anytime soon may need to change your plan. See you soon, our rose latte. 🌹☕️
A bit far but this yummy bagel combo is a winner.

I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism.\"|| a little snippet from Eat Pray Love and a cuppa ::Magic:: at @chockfullofbeans to carry you thru the rest of the working hour。

But first, do drop by Chock Full of Beans if you are in the Changi Village vicinity for some super duper cute latte art on your Iced Latte. Opt for a wide array of characters and if you are lucky, you might even get a 3D latte art such as a Totoro or Baymax, subject to availability. A chilled out laid-back cafe where you can just spend an afternoon there and watch the day zooms by.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafehopping

Ah. Where do I start with this? I let this cake sit for 20mins while i polished off the two other cakes, and to my surprise, it withstood the Singapore heat pretty well. Most cakes would have lost their form by then. I took my 1st bite, and immediately fell in love with it. Granted I was already full with two cakes, and my Bailey\'s iced latte already made me rather happy. However, one bite and I immediately decided that my tummy can make space for this baby. It really is good. The alcohol was not some faint imitation: it was the real deal. It was not diluted by the sweetness of the cake: they had actually paired them so well that the cake complimented the alcohol in it, and made it stand out even more. It was perfectly balanced, that the alcohol was neither overpowering or tasteless like most tiramisu cakes. I think the owner must have similar tastebuds like mine. Hahahaha. A must try! Personally rated 9/10.

Their Eggs Benny had a delightful twist with wholemeal bread used, as well as a generous portion of ham. What a wonderful way to start my Sunday. Chock Full of Beans is nothing but a wonderful cafe, pity too far for me. But will definitely be back for more
Good morning from stitch 😄
Ending up to be my own breakfast. 😫 Good morning people! Godspeed!

Super adorable bear was served to me when I ordered my magic! The coffee was pretty decent, though the milk wasn\'t creamy enough. That aside, the lunch promo was definitely worth it! 
Nicely done eggs.
Instead of normal toast I opt for garlic bread.

Meal and drink of the day. The rose 🌹latte with \'Marie\' as the art definitely is 👍. Not a fan of ☕️ but this definitely is worth the taste👌. The Thursday special of corned beef sandwich with wheat bread🍞 is really awesome. 😋 superb❗️Overall💲is reasonable too, but I think the location a bit too far off east.

Today\'s dinner at Chock Full of Beans with the family. Apparently the food here is not bad too! #instafood #dinner #family #sunday
Chock full of beans serve aroma coffee with pretty latte arts. Pop up during the weekday and you may get your chance to request for your desire type of artwork. Don\'t forget to try their ham and cheese sandwich too! Cafe is small therefore do drop by early to get your seats especially on weekends.
