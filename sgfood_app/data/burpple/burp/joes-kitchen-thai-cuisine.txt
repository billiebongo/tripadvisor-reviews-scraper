Savour every last drop of the dry curry with soft chewy chicken 
Awesome kickass Tom yum soup for the brave hearted. Try it if you dare!
Deliciously fried vermicelli, add your own chilli flakes for that extra kick! 
Awesome cheap pineapple rice. Glad that they serve per bowl so I could finish it. 
Insanely good. Best ice tea I had for a long time.
This is a gorgeous looking and tasting dish comprising of Thai Basil Leaf Chicken with rice, cucumber and egg!
Absolutely delicious and tummy filling food!
Really fulfilling meal.
👍👍
❤️ Thank you Boss for the 9-course meal! 😋👍🏻 A small restaurant under a hdb block that serves quality food! Especially off the menu pork collar was so tender and yummy! 😍
😇
Tried this #joeskitchen first time. Pandan chicken excellent (but $3/piece)! One of the best.  Clear #tomyam (medium 10++) well spiced, authentic and suitable for those who prefer more sour kick over very spicy taste. Stuffed chicken normal. But all tasted very nice with their Thai chilli. Thai milk tea ($3) awesome. Seafood egg tofu hotplate ($12) I think for the price, in future rather try out other dishes in menu.. Pineapple rice have rooms for improvement. Felt that their prawn very tasteless. #sgfood #burpple
Pretty good Tom Yum Soup, $6.80+!
Not gd. $3 \n<br />#burpple #ig_captures #foodreviewsg #sgfoodpics
