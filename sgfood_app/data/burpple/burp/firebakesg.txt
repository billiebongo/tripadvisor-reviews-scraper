Burrata is a weakness of mine. Ok, fair enough - I have a bloody long list of weaknesses üòÇ But seriously, when that creamy white cheese comes decked out in juicy figs, orange blossom balsamic, a drizzle of Greek honey, fresh basil and pine nuts, who in the right mind says no? It\'s enough that we didn\'t come to blows over who gets the last bit.
A seasonal special - air flown cod from New Zealand, Grilled and baked fresh with olive oil. Amazing and tasty! Everything is good here.
The breads here are amazing. Here\'s the bread board with an assortment of sourdough, fruit cake (my favourite) and rye. Served with very good olive oil.
|\n<br />Super packed Prawn flavors. If you aren\'t allergic to shellfish, this is a must try dish. The char-ed shell infused a distinct smokiness. Right balance of saltiness and the taste of the sea.
.\n<br />|\n<br />Cast iron pot, olive oil, sliced garlic and chorizo. Mussel with gold ale created the awesome broth. Especially good for the bread to soak up the broth. Meaty savory. One of our favorite dish to order and eat.
So why not start it with a BANG! I finally head down to @firebakesg over the weekend after hearing all the raving reviews of them, and we love it so much that we\'re planning our next visit already.
This was an interesting one to order. I\'d never had a turmeric latte before - but a quick Google search of the ingredients convinced me since I\'m a big fan of chai. I thought that it was very subtle in flavour - the spices come through well enough and the turmeric is the primary flavour. 
I thought this was nice - the eggs, mushrooms and onions were pretty standard. The bacon though. ü•ì Incredibly thin slices of meat that slap you across the face with salty smoky meaty flavours. Want more.
It\'s not often you find artichoke soup on a menu. So, when I saw this - I had to order it! It was quite tasty - the earthiness of the artichoke and the charred little potatoes made for a great mid day feed.
|\n<br />Firebake served up freshly baked bread by their wood oven. Crazily good bread and I love their plates!

.\n<br />Served with Field - Organic Wholemeal Sourdough Bread. The toasted bread is crisp and crunchy, with a fragrant aroma of grains, and a delicate earthy wheat flavour.\n<br />.\n<br />It pairs well with the bold salty savoury Anchovy Aioli Dip, with its rich, creamy texture. Intense.\n<br />.\n<br />The bread is freshly handmade twice daily (brunch &amp; dinner), baked in a custom built woodfired oven.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Firebake\n<br />More details on blog
.\n<br />Artisanal, Modern European bakery &amp; gastrobar Firebake uses a custom built woodfired oven for their signature sourdough bread.\n<br />.\n<br />Organic flour from Western Australia and wild yeast is used, along with fresh Nordaq water, a filtration process that leaves natural salts and minerals intact within the water.\n<br />.\n<br />The dough then undergoes a natural leavening process, and is freshly baked twice daily (for brunch and dinner) in 4 different varieties.\n<br />.\n<br />All natural and so tasty.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Firebake\n<br />More details on blog
.\n<br />Founder Konstantino Blokbergen, otherwise known as Tino, is a Greek born, Swiss raised, French trained chef and baker, and Firebake is akin to a mashup of an artisanal sourdough bread bakery and a modern European rotisserie and gastrobar.\n<br />.\n<br />The majority of space here is occupied by the kitchen, which includes a 37-tonne woodfired bread oven, hand-built over 6 weeks by specialized craftsmen, using around 5000 bricks.\n<br />.\n<br />The rustic industrial appeal extends to the cutlery, the beautifully patterned porcelain earthernware lends itself well to instastory!.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Firebake\n<br />More details on blog
Poached fruits seem to be of my weaknesses, from poached apples to poached pears; I just seem to end up going for them whenever it appears in a menu. This was a light dessert that puts the meal with a nice ending; very soft, peachy notes alongside a scoop of sourdough ice-cream and rye chip, the sourdough ice-cream itself felt more like a regular smooth and creamy Vanilla ice-cream being aromatic and suitably sweet while the rye chips providing a sour-ish crispiness that is similar to their sourdough bread. The elements does well with the poached peach that is soft to the bite; a dessert that attempts to hit a contrast of flavours and textures altogether.
Being at Firebake for their sourdough bread, it\'s a must for myself to get one of their sourdough toast items such as this one. Asparagus, chorizo and scrambled eggs served atop their signature \"Wave\" bread (which is their organic white sourdough bread), the toast was crisp on the edges with a bit of char for that smoky flavour on top of the suitably sour toast while being light and fluffy. I like how the spicy chorizo gives a bit of bite; a little spicy, and comes savoury ‚Äî that sort of flavour one would expect from cured meat without being overly salty or overwhelming. The asparagus provided a crunch to the entire item, while the scrambled eggs were creamy and runny.
Probably the most disappointing cup of coffee I have had in a while. Using the Ironbark 4.1 blend from Jimmy Monkey, the blend comprises of beans from Colombia, Brazil, Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica. The entire cuppa felt rather watered down with a weak body and was flat-tasting overall. Realized most people aren\'t having their cuppa here with brunch; instead, they seemed to have paired their food with alcohol ‚Äî I guessed they seemed to have already knew better about the coffee here.
Simple ingredients but big on flavours - I mean just look at how beautiful are those Swiss Woodfire Bacon üòç pure umami love. Everything was well balance and so so tasty. Best part was definitely still tasting their incredible firebaked breads, can really taste the difference from the usual run of the mill bread.
Grilled Pork Belly which¬†has been brined, sous vide and grilled.¬†
Woke up with a sudden desire to try the brunch at @firebakesg, so I jumped in a cab and got there in a jiffy.\n<br />My eyes were instantly drawn to the \"Ham &amp; Cheese Toasty on their menu as I was in the mood for something rich and substantial. It was a good choice, if I may say so myself.\n<br />The large, thick slice of house-made white sourdough (which goes by the name of \"Wave\") had been spread with Norwegian butter and mustard, followed by a neat layering of ham, brie and cheddar cheeses, strips of pickles and tomatoes. I like that they kept the ham topmost because after being popped in the oven, it was lightly crisped which made it extra tasty.

A weekend brunch session at @firebakesg is the exact thing you should wake up for every weekend.
Fruit loaf and Rye bread was amaze and all the dishes are done to perfection. Friendliest staff led by owner Tino.Lucky east siders
Yummy. Chicken is cook juz nice n e sauce goes well. Slightly salty
Artisanal game strong ‚Äì rustic and flavourful chunky chicken liver pate is paired with the restaurant\'s seminal freshly baked woodfired white sourdough and sourdough fruit loaf. A match made in heaven that\'s made even better with the crunchy tang of cornichons and pickled onions. 
Enthusiast who enjoy sourdough in all its forms would love Firebake‚Äôs Sourdough ice cream. Just like the bakes but in a rich gooey state, the smooth texture was amazing. With a unique yet pronounced depth of flavour, you will get the distinctive wheaty edge of the dough but certainly not unpleasant. And my favourite part is having the creaminess just dissolve in your mouth and glide down the throat. A real treat as they embrace the natural delicate sourness and subtle sweetness of the ingredients.
Massive self-control was exercised when I did the ordering of our appetisers and mains. All because Burppler @blueskiescottonclouds highly recommended this Bread and Butter Pudding.\n<br />There is something intrinsically comforting about hot puddings and here was more proof.\n<br />Served in a mini iron saucepan, it comprised of slices of Firebake\'a popular fruit loaf (heavily studded with a mix of organic Australian dried fruit) embedded in sweet custard. This marriage of their chewy bread and wobbly custard was heavenly. I could already imagine how wonderful it would be to linger over this on a cool, rainy night.
Having heard a number of people rave about the Australian Prawn Capellini Aglio Olio at Firebake, I was determined to eat it tonight. Guess what? I am officially now one of those people too! üòÜ\n<br />If you are into prawns and pasta, this is not to be missed. The grilled prawns were great, but for me, it was the pasta that stole the show.\n<br />Every strand in that big pile of al dente angel hair pasta was \"umami-maximus\" thanks to the generous amount of prawn oil used. In fact, it is what accounted for the vivid orangey hue of the dish as well. Extra texture came from the delicately crispy Sakura ebi. For something so small, they sure exuded an immense amount of flavour. I loved that the chef threw in plenty of thinly sliced garlic in this aglio olio too.\n<br />One portion is large enough to be shared between two people. But the question is, do you really want to? üòâ
Pumpkin isn\'t necessarily something I automatically go gaga for. I have to be in the mood and of course, the way it\'s prepared has to resonate with me. This Woodfired Pumpkin Salad at Firebake hit the jackpot.\n<br />Roasted to the point of mushy softness, the large wedges of pumpkin came with crumbly chunks of feta and a heap of fresh mixed greens. The dressing used for the salad and the salty cheese complemented the sweetness of the pumpkin better than I imagined.
Apart from stellar sourdough, this Eastside hotspot also turns out a pretty wonderful steak ‚Äî perfect for days you feel like both carbs AND protein. Its casual yet buzzy ambience makes it suited both for a laidback date, as well as for a fun catch-up meal with friends. Order the Rangers Valley Striploin (300g, $38), which Burpple Tastemaker Felicia Sim declares to be \"juicy, flavorful and tender to bite\". This is further complemented by the side of wood-fired Jerusalem artichokes. Don\'t be put off by the charred exterior ‚Äî their insides are soft and incredibly sweet. The food here is generally done very well, so you are unlikely to go wrong with whichever other sharing plates you choose to order. Enjoy them all with the Firebake Bread Board ($10), which showcases the best of their made-from-scratch bread, served with salted butter and olive oil on the side. \n<br />Avg Price: $50 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Felicia Sim
The aggressively oceanic-perfumed ebi pasta possessed the \"nothing-but-a-T-shirt-on\" feel good soul of a greasy char bee hoon stir-fry, whilst elsewhere the smoky prawns possessed a naive sweetness of flesh and delectably crunchy legs. 4/5
The broth played it all wholesome Chinese soul but the pork belly was decidedly un-Asian, eschewing the usual docile character of pork ribs or similar in Chinese soups for a more aggressive Western stance. The thick, gelatinous skin wobbled with the violence of a Nicki Minaj video, and each bite released a powerful blast of earthy, intensely salty oinky goodness locked within. 3.8/5
What I wouldn\'t give to be digging into a hot pan of this right now! This bread and butter pudding is the best I\'ve ever had. üî•
Another stunner from Firebake, if you prefer your carbs in pasta form then this is for you. This comes with two large Australian prawns, al dente capellini tossed in oh-so fragrant prawn oil and a generous sprinkling of Sakura ebi. üëÖüí¶üí¶üí¶
More like a p√¢t√© in my mouth. üëÖüí¶üí¶üí¶Oh man, this was sooooo good, it took all our willpower not to fill up on just this and their uhhmazing bread. üçû
I like my carbs, but I didn\'t know I LOVED them till I had the loafs at #FirebakeSG. Seriously impressive sourdoughs (mains are good too!) that\'ll have me coming back for more, even if it\'s all the way in the yEast. Congrats again @bing_leow and @kblokbergen! #MediaTasting
Had a bread feast tonight! My favorite? The Field (wholemeal) and The Valley (with plump apricots and sultanas). Don\'t need anything else but carbs in my life. Got a fruit loaf to go because life is too short for regrets. Thankful for friends @kblokbergen @bing_leow who feed me! Can\'t wait to be back for a proper meal. And.. when can I start my apprenticeship?
Must must must try the bread when you are there. Amazing. The bread platter is a good way to try all - I really like the fruit loaf although I normally do not like fruit bread! The menu is bread-centric too - take this pork belly in vegetable broth.. the bread would be very useful in soaking up all the goodness.
Firebake specializes in house baked organic sourdough bread and for dessert, the Organic Sourdough Fruit Loaf in used in the Bread and Butter Pudding. Mixed with a creme anglaise, it is baked in their specially built wood fired oven till golden brown and extremely fragrant!
300g rangers valley striploin ‚Äî juicy, flavorful and tender to bite. It is served with wood-fired Jerusalem artichokes imported from France that are utterly charred on the outside, but incredibly sweet on the inside.
This long-anticipated opening is THE place to go to for stellar woodfired sourdough bread (check out their custom-made lava stone oven) and hearty dishes to accompany them. Start with the Firebake Bread Board ($10), which showcases the best of chef-owner Konstantino Blokbergen\'s made-from-scratch creations ‚Äî rye, wholemeal, white and fruit ‚Äî served with salted butter and olive oil on the side. Beef that up with lip-smacking plates like the super Smoked Eggplant ($15) and, what seems to be a house favourite, Norwegian Blue Mussels ($25). Slurp that all on their own, or mop it up with more bread. If you\'re dropping by before sunset on a lazy Sunday (as you should), dine alfresco and dive into the decadent 4-Spice Chicken Liver Pat√© ($12) as you soak in the relaxed vibes and warm hospitality. The restaurant is currently open for dinner, but plans for all-day dining in April are underway. Stay tuned.\n<br />Avg price: $40 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua
Here\'s a study of delicious contrast: juicy slab of grilled pork belly with an addictively salty crackling wallows in a clear pool of garden vegetable broth.\n<br />From the side, a house-baked slice of rye casts a neutral eye over this coming together of the sinful and the saintly, the yin and the yang.\n<br />I found my happy place at their intersection üòÑ
If you are looking for something light but still raging with flavour, you should consider this. Cured in-house, the fish is marvelously moist and melt-in-the-mouth tender. It may be a little on the salty side due to the curing but that\'s where the leeks, dill and sweet pickled onions come in to balance things out. I loved getting a bit of everything in each bite as they taste best together.
Loved how it was jammed pack with a variety of fruits! It\'s weird, but I think it\'ll go well with a slice of kraft cheeseüòÇ
So many orders of this pot of mussels ($25++) went sailing by that despite having confirmed our main courses, we decided to go with the flow and get one for ourselves.\n<br />As this place is a bakehouse, the theme of wheat was continued in this dish. So instead of the typical white wine, the plump, creamy-fleshed Norwegian blue mussels were simmered in lager. The choice of alcohol gave the broth a unique taste profile, while the plentiful sliced onions, garlic and fresh herb boosted sweetness and fragrance.\n<br />Firebake is only serving dinner from 6pm to 10pm for now but come April, they will be throwing their doors open at 7.30am for all-day dining.
The big ass smoked eggplant wasn\'t the lone operative in pulling off the heist on my tastebuds. This was a team effort with sly spiced hummus, slippery green tomato chunks, hard-nosed manchego and tough-guy toasted barley, all moving in as one.\n<br />Even the thought of putting up a fight was ridiculously laughable.
I know of a few ardent foodies who have been waiting with bated breath for FireBake to open. To be honest, I\'ve lost count of the number of times we\'ve driven past the place ourselves to check if they\'ve begun operations. Anyway, they have - yay! So we hustled down for dinner tonight, on their second day of business.\n<br />We started with the Firebake Bread Board because duh, it\'s a no-brainer to go with what Bing Leow, supportive wife of the chef-owner recommends.\n<br />All four breads: the rye, white, wholemeal and fruit were made from scratch in-house. And baked in their wood-fired, lava stone oven that was constructed brick by brick on the premises.\n<br />If I was forced to choose, I\'d pick the white and the fruit as my faves. The former because basic never tasted so good, and the latter for all the gorgeous dried organic fruit within (I am already imagining how awesome it\'d taste sliced thin and toasted).\n<br />Let\'s also not forget the show-stealing accompaniments of Norwegian salted butter and green-gold Greek extra virgin olive oil sprinkled with some sea salt. If these are not already kept under lock and key, I advise that course of action be taken asap.
So replaced by sourdough white bread. I am a creature of habit.. well most times. I love dunking in my bread to soak up the runny yolks. In this instance, I could not as the yolks here were solid and the crust was alittle hard but the middle was soft. I did ask the staff if it was their version. She came back with a bowl and a soft boiled egg. Showed to me and said it is the same. And I was alittle taken aback when she stretched her arm out with the bowl and asked \"so do you want this\"? Impoliteness begets impoliteness. I think at that point in time I could feel abit of heat on my face but I nicely said no.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />Requested for dark soya sauce and pepper for the eggs. Sauce came and crew said \"I will be back with the pepper\". It never arrived. The place was surprisingly crowded today. However, I noticed some inconsistency in service (most times I am there it was good). Some tables were served with water whereas afew including me was not. Were we suppose to ask for it?\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />But I still finished the eggs and the bread.  And always loved the crockery.
Al fresco cafe. Well like their name, they specialize in baked goods in the form of sourdough
.\n<br />The only place where I would order a bread platter on its own to eat with Norwegian butter and Hibiscus Jam.
New found favourite brunch spot. The bread was good!
Aldente capellini. Tossed, turned, twirled in olive oils till each strand has an oily shimmering coat. Fingertips that gently but swiftly in teeny circular motion swishing &amp; sprinkling salt and embraced by the capellini. Grilled prawns with a little charredness. Flesh was sweet and atad smoky. Wait@ Dont throw away the heads! Give it a dainty squeeze, the jus flows out and that is when you drink up. So umami!!! Teeny ebi prawns added that crunchy finish.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Imagine this! Me, myself and I slurping every strand. Oh yah and .... burp! So good. No imagination.

Had high hopes for brunch here but this was flagrantly pedestrian. Portobello, caramelised onions and Swiss wood-fired bacon are coddled by slightly overcooked eggs, and accompanied by sourdough toast. As a whole it was too dry and would have benefitted from some form of sauce or serving the eggs runnier as they still cook in the pan even as we‚Äôre eating them.
I enjoyed this a lot - layers of oozy brie, caramelized tomato slices and charred folds of ham atop a crisp slice of Firebake\'s \"wave\" organic white bread -  but couldn\'t shake the feeling anyone could just as easily make this at home for a fraction of the price.
This sounded healthy yet delicious on the menu but we were let down by how bland and unseasoned it was. The faintly sweet pomelo and pomegranate segments alleviated this somewhat but could not save the absolutely boring quinoa as well as the character-less heirloom tomatoes that frankly tasted as though they were cheap garden variety tomatoes bought off the shelves of your neighbourhood supermarket.
It‚Äôs quite rich, hence do share the calories.\n<br />#firebakesg #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #whatiate #whatiatetoday #yummers #burpple #hungrygowhere #foodpic #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #eatoutsg #sgeats #fooddiaries #onthetable #foodphotography #fatdieme #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger #weekends #sundays
It also looks burnt compared to the other post of this .. And I can\'t help to feel that there\'s a slight sour aftertaste. The Pudding/bread ratio could definitely be more for this.. quite disappointing but I\'ll give it a go another time.

I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical when this arrived. Boy was I surprised. The pork belly was very well done - the crackling was super crispy but the meat still tender.\n<br />*\n<br />It was served with a very hearty vegetable broth.

The pumpkin was nicely grilled and topped with lots of pistachio and other crunchy bits. The combination of pistachios, orange blossom and molasses was lovely. I wouldn\'t have thought of serving burrata with pumpkin but it worked really well.\n<br />*\n<br />This dish was highly recommended by my nephew. We were surprised when my nephew came out to greet us. He had just begun working (for a few months) with Firebake as one of the chefs in the kitchen. Thank you for the recommendation.

This was absolutely delicious. The mussels were plump succulent and more importantly the broth was really tasty.\n<br />*\n<br />It was served with a few slices of white sourdough loaf.

That is how fresh the breads are.\n<br />*\n<br />You can order a bread board to sample the different types of sourdough bread. Having done that during our first visit, we made a beeline for our favourite, the sourdough fruit loaf. We ordered the whole loaf and cut half for dinner, the remainder to be brought home.\n<br />*\n<br />There was a generous helping of dried fruits in the fruit loaf which made it sooo yummy. We had ours toasted. You must remember to spread some of that tasty Norwegian butter on it. Delicious!\n<br />*\n<br />I had the pleasure of being introduced to Chef/Owner @kblokbergen by @veronicaphua at the Salted and Hung birthday bash. I just wanted to say that I love the whole concept of a woodfired bakehouse where artisan bread takes centre stage, whether to mop up delicious gravy or as part of an awesome bread &amp; butter pudding.

it was very good, especially so with the crunchiness of the nuts and a little sweetened up so it\'s got just the balance of sweet and salty. in fact, the tiny tinge of spice from the Egyptian Dukkah added the element of surprise in the taste but it doesn\'t overwhelm. love this dish!
if i had to choose, i\'d go straight for The Valley (Sourdough Fruit Loaf) cos i love them sweet! but hey, they\'re all Organic Rye/Wholemeal/White (in top down order) so what\'s not to love about every single loaf üçûÔºü @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @chopesg #chopesg @firebakesg #firebakesg #woodfire #bread
Firebake\'s bread and butter pudding. I love bread and butter pudding but even more so when they make it with their fruit loaf. The fruit loaf is ever so nicely caramelised and the custard was soft, eggy and the first portion was gone in a blink of an eye that we had to order seconds.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#breadandbutterpudding #fruitloaf #sogoodmustorderseconds #sweettreats #sweetendings #sweettemptations #desserts #firebakesg #sgfoodie #sgfood #burpple #burpplesg #foodstagram #sgig #sg #bscc_firebakesg
We were all curious how this would taste and surprisingly, it didn\'t taste strange at all and the sourdough ice cream and rye chip complemented the poached plum well.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#plum #sourdoughicecream #ryechip #sweettreats #sweetendings #sweettemptations #firebakesg #communaldining #desserts #burpple #burpplesg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgig #sg #foodstagram #bscc_firebakesg
Again, am really glad we did. Woodfired pumpkin, burrata, pistachio dukkah, orange blossom and molasses, this main plate really wowed us! Interesting textures and certainly loved the flavours.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#woodfired #pumpkin #dukkah #mainplates #communaldining #firebakesg #burpplesg #burpple #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgig #sg #foodstagram #bscc_firebakesg

I am not a fan of mussels but this was amazing! I kept digging in for more and that broth was just so full of umami! Goodness of the sea and the land all blending in harmony. Some of slurp it up like soup whilst others mopped it up with bread.

Australian prawn capellini aglio olio with Sakura Ebi. It was so good that some of us wanted a third order! I will definitely order this again.

Lightly tossed with pickled cucumbers, feta, dill and mountain oregano, it\'s a really refreshing appetiser.

From the small plates, we had the smoked eggplant, spiced hummus, tomatoes and manchego. This was surprisingly refreshing. The eggplant was tender and yet retaining some bite was paired off so nicely with the rest of the ingredients.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#appetisers #smallplates #smokedeggplant #manchego#hummus#tomatoes #firebakesg #communaldining #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sg #bscc_cafesg

A wood fire roasted pumpkin with burrata, cured salmon with bread crust, and their amazing fruit sourdough bread pudding! More on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio!
Company even better!
Grilled pork belly with garden vegetable broth and rye bread. Pork belly was slowcooked then pan roasted. Oh yes.... the skin crackled beautifully with similarities to the \"sio bak\". Broth was so umami and the potatoes, carrots, celeriac, fennel gave that softer finish to a robust meaty mouthfeel. The mussels had its own gravy...a tinge of saltyness that prolly oozed out from the chorizos. This is a good \"dunk in dunk out\" dish. Yummy rye bread baked in wood fired oven was just so perfect for soaking up all the \"mussel-licious\" gravy. Hmm... rye bread had a wokheish flavor and aroma. Really good!!\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Just two of us. Just two dishes. Just enough to satisfy our hungry tummies. Just so good. Just #inmyhood #inmybackyard so no need to go far for amazeballs wood fired goodness.
What Firebake has done is to smoke the eggplant and stuffed it with spiced hummus. The Smoked Eggplant ($15) further topped with tomato manchego, cheese and crispy barley for the additional contrast of textures and flavouts.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #eggplant #firebakesg
It also features contemporary dishes cooked with traditional European techniques, which complement and showcase the range of woodfire baked sourdough bread.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />For sourdough lovers, there are many ways to enjoy the freshly baked bread. One of which is the 4-Spice Chicken Liver Pate ($12) which comes with in house cured pickles and onion.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #sourdough #chickenpate
Never one to rave about this dessert as many places either make it mediocrely or it just doesn\'t look appealing but my perception of it took a 360 turn here. My benchmark for bread and butter pudding has now been set at an all time high after having Firebake\'s version.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Using their fruit loaf as the bread base, a cr√®me anglaise custard mixture containing sugar, egg yolks, hot milk and vanilla beans from the vanilla pod, was poured in. Upon order, this mini cauldron is transported into the custom-built oven. After a preparation time of 15 minutes, out came this bad boy bubbling away, waiting to be devoured. Absolutely divine.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Firebake\n<br />Address: 237, East Coast Road, Singapore 428930\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #firebakesg
Coated with bread crumbs from their bakes, the outer layer alike fish skin has a crusty texture while the inner is silky smooth that cuts like butter with the slightest force needed from a fork. Paired with dill, leek and pickled onions, this seemingly simple looking dish requires lots of technical execution to get it right and at the same time, mouthwatering.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Firebake\n<br />Address: 237, East Coast Road, Singapore 428930\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #firebakesg
Using a sourdough base and organic ingredients, the bread board comes with a thick slice of their white, wholemeal, rye and fruit loaf, with a lovely pairing of the Greek EVOO and a cut of Norwegian butter. This bread starter was a wonderful lead in to the mains. To find artisanal breads in Singapore is extremely difficult, so mark your calendars and make a trip here before it gets too crowded!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Firebake\n<br />Address: 237, East Coast Road, Singapore 428930\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #firebakesg

Crisp skin and flesh was juicy and moist. Celeriac is a root veg. It had a mild nutty flavor. The broth was a little mellow but gave a very comforting aftertone. It is great for rainy and windy days or days when one feels like having a not too heavy meaty meal and a simple broth. This bowl gives you both. üî∏üî∏\n<br />I do like this and definitely will go back for it #inmyhood üî∏üî∏\n<br />Firebake is only in its soft launch stage and is currently open only for dinner. Please do make reservations.
