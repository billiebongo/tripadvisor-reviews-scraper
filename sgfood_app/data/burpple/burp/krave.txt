My new favelet dish. Its spags with rendang minced meat. How awesome is dat? Couldnt ask for more. Was having this all to myself tho. #iaintsharing -policy. Nyaha.. Go try it urself..! U wont regret~ #halal #highlyrecommended 
One word: Sinful. Lovin\' the fusion of East-meets-West tho. Sweet indulgance. A must haf fo sweettooth-ers. #halal 
After having a steak, pizza and drumlets,we ordered their speciality Chempedak Creme Brulee. It was bitterly sweet and I liked it. The combination of the taste was unique. The added bonus was the actual fruit in the dessert. We\n<br /> also had the Gula Melaka Drink. This was a concoction of Gula Melaka and red beans. This smoothie was not too sweet (just the way I like it).
At Krave, expect to find classic western café favourites with a Malay-flavoured twist. Find items like Kraving Ayam Bakar ($15.00) — char-grilled chicken served atop ketupat (rice cakes) drenched in a sweet and spicy sauce, and Cempedak Creme Brulee ($7) — cempedak being a fruit somewhat similar to jackfruit and unique to Southeast Asia. Fans of classic café grub won\'t be disappointed either, as you can find your fair share of truffle fries, lava cakes, pastas and pizzas. If you\'re in the mood for pasta, Tastemaker Veronica Phua recommends the Aglio Olio Pesto Smoked Salmon Pasta ($16) as well! \n<br />*Muslim-owned
Cafe food, what\'s not to be missed is the chempedak Creme brûlée 
This cup of Joe (flat white - $5) was smooth, creamy and delicious. Though I would prefer my coffee to be stronger, but then again, my caffeine tolerance level has gone up a notch. I do love that smoothness and I didn\'t taste too much acidic. Nice! :)
You never tasted anything as good as this east meet west
Cempedak Creme Brulee. So awesomely good...! Rich in cempedak flavour and you can have a bite of the cempedak fruit in it. It\'s not too sweet, very balanced flavour on your taste buds. I give this dessert rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. A must try when you dine in at Krave.  
These amazingly sinful bites are crisp on the outside, and gooey with caramel and melted chocolate on the inside. With vanilla ice cream at the bottom, don\'t be surprised to find yourself on a sugar rush. Seems like a small serving, but just one of these bars are enough to have your stomach satisfied but screaming for more than your fitness trainer allows 😉
I have been searching for an halal alternative to satisfy my steak cravings. So far not many places have lived up to my standards as I have been spoilt by places like Cut, BedRock, Bistecca etc but Krave was really good - and affordable too!
Very crunchy prawns. Went well with the sweet mango chunks and generous mix of greens.
Ordered these as appetisers to share. While the Shrimp O\'Nauts was acceptable, the \'O\'Tahtah missed the mark. The batter coating wasn\'t crunchy and had a bit of a stale oil taste. It wouldn\'t have been so bad if the \"otah\" had been decent. Unfortunately, there was hardly any aroma or spiciness, plus it was way too mushy.
The lava effect was impactful. Once a cut was made in the cake, warm chocolate sauce flowed out and pretty much \"ponded\" over the plate. Sure to be a crowd pleaser this one.
If you \"krave\" a pasta (sorry for the pun but it\'s just begging for it 😝) that\'s packed with flavour but not of the spicy kind, this is something you can consider.\n<br />Listed under \"Specials\" on their menu, what you get is al dente pasta (choose between spagetti or penne) cooked in fragrant pesto along with olive oil and garlic slices. I very much liked the extra savoury element that the broken up pieces of smoked salmon brought to it. 
The grilled chicken thigh had the skin still on, which may not be the healthiest thing but oh man, did that add extra flavour! There\'s also a generous amount of house-made guacamole and salsa slapped in between those slices of sourdough which made for yummily saucy bites. Tagging along with the sandwich were salad leaves dressed in a sweet dressing and a pile of chunky fries. They could do no wrong either.\n<br />#KraveCafe #halalcafe #BaliLane #sgcafe #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #instafoodsg #sgfood #sgeats #burpple
said my lunch kaki 👍🏻\n<br />🐔
Chicken breast chucks were not tough but I prefer wings. Interesting to eat pasta with curry though I would say the perfect marriage would still be curry &amp; jiam tou roti 😜\n<br />🌶
Too oily, too spicy, too much pesto, too much spaghetti and the amount of smoked salmon was just pathetic. I wished I had the creamy penne pasta that @sperosparrow was having beside me.
(1) Arrabiatta Seafood (top left) (2) Alfredo (top right) (3) Truffle Fries (bottom left) (4) Arrabiatta Chicken (bottom right) (5) Price: $16 + $14 + $12 + $14 (6) Rate: 4/5 but the truffle fries is 5/5!!
Plus generous portions to boot too 👍
I had Aglio Oglio pesto smoked salmon while my partner had the sambal marinara. Very satisfied. Worth the money. The sambal marinara is a bit too spicy though that my partner couldn\'t finish his food😅 . But overall it was good! And ofcos no visit to krave is complete without trying their famous cempedak creme brûlée. 👍🏼😋
The cream was a bit too heavy but it was a big portion and very delicious! 😋
🍔 &amp; 🍕
A little expensive but good stuff.
Keep it up! Out of all the food we ordered, u have to got to try the juicy BURGER and pizza! They taste worth it! Good food comes with awesome company!  #food #foodporn #yummy #tasty #goodfood #eats #delicious #foodpics #foodgasm #tasty #flipafood #burpple
generous portion, friendly prices (no taxes). one of the best halal cafes I\'ve tried so far.

Pasta was al dente. Curry was thick and rich.
Owner-Chef Sufiyan does a marvellous job with the sauce, which expertly balances sweetness and spiciness. Drench it over the tender grilled chicken thigh, sedap!
Heard about the truffle fries here and just had to give it a try together with my boyf. For someone who hasn\'t really experienced truffle to its fullest (except for the truffle pizza at Spizza which is oh so yummy), the truffle fries here doesn\'t disappoint at all which makes Krave the go-to cafe if you wanna have your virgin truffle fries experience. The thick-cut fries were seasoned with just the right amount of truffle oil, and the portion was generous. The fragrance when the bucket is served at your table is enough to make you salivate and be eager to dig in. Yes, it\'s that good!
