basically hello kitty version of beef rendang (rendang is caramalised curry if you dont know whats that). comes with a salad too. its really cute and although its quite expensive but its really worth the money. this dish is very nice and to me, its quite filling although the portion doesnt really look big :-) mild spicy🌶 though
really cute name ok anyways its salmon as the name suggests with breadcrumbs coated over it and comes with a salad. i dont think its really worth the price its worth for as its not really that nice but the sauce accompanying it was great!! the sauce is mild spicy and a lil sour🌶
BILL: $76.86 inclusive of GST and service charge \n<br />Mains $17.50, $17.90\n<br />Nachos $15.90\n<br />Iced lattes $7 each 
This Cowabunga! Wagyu! [$24] came to mind, and got me reminiscing the flavourful Wagyu beef rendang pairing it with the kitty-shaped Japanese rice. Cutesy food can taste good alrights 😉
🍴 Was expecting mediocre food for a themed cafe, and I guess I was truly surprised! It was a good hello kitty experience, afterall this is what all themed restaurants are about, no?\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple #changiairport #hellokitty #hellokittyorchidgarden
The chips with cheese are perfect match with a hint of tangy sweetness from the cherry tomato salsa. Simple yet addictive! \n<br />See the full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/07/09/hello-kitty-cafe-singapore/ (active link at bio)
Price: S$18.90
Food looks aesthetically pretty and honestly the food quality exceeded my expectations. Be prepared to queue. I\'m willing to go back and dine there again despite the long queues because the food, location and ambience is quite a refreshing change from the city centre
😻 The cute kitty waffle is served with creamy scrambled eggs, smoked duck slices and Shitake mushrooms. \n<br />See the full review at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/07/09/hello-kitty-cafe-singapore/ (active link at bio)
Lets do the salsa ($16.50++) with kitty - sandwich on the dried side🙄 but cross fries was okay . The cat in paradise ($18.50++) - icecream nv fails, the mango mousse was alright. Hibiscus and lavender cooler ($7.90++), 👍🏻 love it as theres lavender -M
Kitty Goes Bananas Split, as the name suggests it\'s a banana split. The flavours of the ice cream were not rich enough (vanilla was way too sweet). Liked the variety of ingredients used though. The white chocolate shaped like hello kitty tasted like nothing :/ great presentation, but not so much in taste. Still a pretty decent sweet treat.
Enchanted Forest [$17.90]- quesadillas with prawns, avocado, lettuce wasabi dressing and cheese in a tortilla shell. The tortilla was a bit soggy, though the sides were crispy and a little burnt (which I like). The wasabi sauce was pretty unique, and I loved the stretchy cheese which gave texture to each bite. Thought the serving was really sad at first, but it did fill me up. \n<br />The iced salted caramel latte [$7.90] was not bad, there was a hint of caramel which didn\'t overpower the latte. The peach sunrise [$7.00] was just sad. The peach syrup to soda ratio was just sad. Couldn\'t really taste the peach. \n<br />Overall, average and overpriced food. There was no queue at 830pm on a weekday, and the decor was quite pretty. Come here for the experience, not the food.
Maybe the hype was over, totally no queue at all??!!! 2 kid-size Hello Kitty were there for photography &amp; the menu was printed colorfully.  The setting was nice for picture but I must say the food was not worth a visit.  Guess this would be my first &amp; also my last visit unless the menu is revised.  Just so you know, this cafe is operated by the same group that runs Swensen\'s &amp; thus I\'m disappointed by the quality of the food 😒 #burpple
I just arrived back in Singapore and I\'m missing Budapest already 😭 Dropped by the Hello Kitty Cafe because since I was at the airport, why not! I tried the Big Breakfast Surprise ($18), which didn\'t have that great waffles, one was soggy and the other was crispy throughout, but presentation was cute! I think it\'s quite overpriced to be honest. Lighting wasn\'t that good too, that\'s why there are shadows sorry! 😱 Read more about it and my reviews on the other food we tried in my blog! http://www.foodwithnic.wordpress.com

But since the photo is practically one of the few reasons to dine at the @hellokittycafesingapore, I might as well get as well. Read about what are some things that may feed you somewhat if you are dragged there for a meal. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio.
This pretty dessert, The Cat In Paradise $18.50 features a refreshing mango mousse with almond crumble, berry compote, marshmallow sauce and hazelnut gelato. It was light on the palette with a hint of citrus. 🍰 #hellokittycafesg
$19.50 How does a scoop of ice-cream with 2 wafers stacked up against it and a fancy name cost more than a main dish here? Was not impressed at all.
$17.90 Comes with an ultra long story-description in the menu. Too much fat and skin on the chicken for my liking. By the time I\'d taken off the fat and skin, I wasn\'t left with much meat.
$16.50 Probably the cutest looking item on the menu with the sandwich shaped like Kitty\'s head. The taste was nothing to gush about.
Soft Serve Frozen Yogurt with my favourite feline! 🐱*squeals in delight*\n<br />•\n<br />You can choose your own toppings and I had mine with granola, strawberries and hello kitty white chocolate, drizzled with strawberry sauce. Each cup is around $4.90-$6.90, depending on the number of toppings (1-3) you choose. Additional toppings at $1.20-$2.50 each.\n<br />•\n<br />Was expecting the froyo to be sweet cos of the strawberry sauce but it wasn\'t! The froyo was creamy &amp; I like that the strawberry sauce was a little tangy and complements the froyo well. Now, I can have my froyo fix at the airport! Can\'t wait to go back &amp; grab a cup cos cos the takeaway cup is sooooo cute! 😻\n<br />•\n<br />Don\'t like froyo? They have 8 flavours of gelato to choose from too! Still prefer the froyo thou\'.
🍴🍴🍴 .\n<br />Not the best plate of big breakfast, but I\'m pretty sure food is not the main reason that attracts us here. 😌 .\n<br />Come prepared with a fully charged camera/phone to take more photos of the gorgeous space!😍👍🏻
Fans of beloved Sanrio character Hello Kitty can now dine with her at Hello Kitty Orchid Garden. Located at Changi Airport Terminal 3, this is the first 24-hour Hello Kitty cafe in the world. Like other cafes in the international chain, this garden-themed cafe is decked out with \"Kitty touches\" from the wooden bow chairs to the white garden fences and even the carrots in your Cowabunga Wagyu ($24). Apart from mains, there are light bites like the Hello Kitty stamped Hola Nachos ($15.90) and the locally inspired pandan panna cotta called Hide &amp; Seek ($16.90). The latter comes topped with vanilla gelato, gula Melaka, passionfruit and strawberry sauce. If you\'re hankering for something light before your flight, grab a Soft Serve Frozen Yogurt (from $4.90) before taking a photo or two with the specially designed, double bowed Hello Kitty figurines in the cafe!\n<br />Avg price: $30 per person
.\n<br />Who says it has to be pink?\n<br />The first 24hour Hello Kitty themed cafe around makes me heartened that they have deemed Singapore fit for it. Even for a non-kitty fan like me, i\'m thrilled to step foot inside this 84-seater garden cafe. I have to say the interior is classy and they even incorporated Singapore\'s National Flower, the Orchids, against the whitish background. They have real orchids in the planters (not those hanging from the roof though). Not over the top which means your boyfriends won\'t feel intimidated entering. 🙊\n<br />.\n<br />What about the food?\n<br />Better than expected. I know how themed cafe food can be, but here i feel the food is quite nice and i would come back and eat again because the food is too pretty! (without the queues). I would recommend the wagyu beef rendang with elements of our local food delights. Prices are reasonable, ranging from $16-$24. Not forgetting it being 24h, means we can swing by for supper.\n<br />.\n<br />The Queue\n<br />I would recommend odd hours for shorter waiting time. The queues are definitely long during lunch and especially dinner time. Lasted even after we left. In short, if you\'re not a kitty fan, just wait for all the kitty devotees to go first la.\n<br />.\n<br />Located at L1 Changi Airport T3\n<br />Just avoid 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month as this cafe will be closed at around 2am for maintenance.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @sixthsensepr and @where.is.karl for extending the invite!
It is also the world\'s first 24-hour Hello Kitty cafe, so it means that you can get your Hello Kitty fix any time you wish.\n<br />•\n<br />This Big Breakfast Surprise comprised creamy scrambled eggs, smoked duck slices, sautéed shiitake mushrooms and Kitty waffles embedded with melted cheddar. Not the kind of waffle texture that I adored but every other components works well in my mouth and is completed together with the honey lime maple syrup.\n<br />•\n<br />I wasn\'t having any usual expectations prior to coming here but the food served is actually not bad. Read that some are slamming the food quality after the 2-3 hours of queue but I totally empathize them since the duration of the queue definitely impact the perception of the food quality.\n<br />So to hello kitty... Manage your queue line\n<br />So to the rest.... Manage your expectation\n<br />And we can all live happily in a hello kitty world 😊\n<br />•\n<br />Thank you @hellokittycafesingapore for having us yesterday night and @sixthsensepr for the invitation.
(Time check was 10pm). Shortcake Surprise (SGD17.90++) which consists of wild strawberry and vanilla gelato on a bed of cheesecake crumble, topped with berries and drizzled with chocolate and raspberry sauce. \n<br />The gelato was quite good, but at SGD17.90, it\'s really expensive for 2 scoops of gelato with a little crumbs. Think majority of the cost goes into plating this dish to fit the kitty theme.
The kitty-shaped waffle was hard and dry, but the square-shaped waffle was fluffy soft. Scrambled eggs and shiitake mushrooms were decent, but the smoked duck slices was a miss. What I love most about this dish is the unique honey lime maple syrup which makes for a refreshing dish.
Watermelon, basil and soda 》$7.90
Peeled-cut fries topped with a sprinkle of Himalayan pink salt and parmesan cheese, served with truffle ketchup 》$10.50
Creamy Scrambled eggs, Shiitake mushrooms, smoked duck slices and a kitty waffle topped with cheese and paired with their homemade honey lime maple syrup 》$18.50
Sgd 17.50\n<br />A homemade buttery orange sugee cake baked to moist perfection, sprinkled with chocolate soil and surrounded by delicate petals of strawberry butter cream. Served with a velvety scoop of peanut buttercup gelato.\n<br />I don\'t like much the orange sugee cake, it was soft, tasty but very dry. Lucky it was paired with a creamy peanuty gelato and I must say its the best peanut flavour ice cream that I\'ve tasted ever 👊! It really saved the dessert set.\n<br />Recommendation:\n<br />Gelato ice cream - 🍴🍴🍴\n<br />Sugee cake -🍴
Sgd 15.90\n<br />Crunchy tortilla chips topped with parmesan, jalapenos, olives, onions and cherry tomato salsa. Topped with cheese sauce with a hello kitty stamped on a tortilla chip.\n<br />Tortilla chips is crispy added with all those ingredients I mention is a hit! Salsa make it more delectable. Another must try in Hello Kitty Cafe menu.\n<br />Recommendation:🍴🍴
Sgd 19.50\n<br />A tent made out of graham crackers and nice scoops of hazelnut and chocolate gelato. Surrounded by matcha powder, toasted muesli, mixed berries and cute white chocolate Hello Kitty figure on the side.\n<br />This very cute sundae set is a pricey one for a small serving but worth trying.\n<br />Recommendation: 🍴🍴
Hello Kitty waffles with cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs, shiitake mushrooms and smoked duck - portion still acceptable, nothing special.. average taste 
The first and only 24-hours Hello Kitty Cafe in the world, also featuring Kitty with a unique double bow and it\'s the only Hello Kitty Cafe serving their own selection of gelato.
👋🏼🐱🎀 Emboss hello kitty print on a tortilla, use a sandwich shaper to cut the bread, add two giant hello kitty mascot and poof a gimmicky cafe is born. Enchanted Forest, a quesadilla with shrimp avocado and wasabi mayo was a disappointment, tasted bland and one dimensional. Land of the Rising Sun, teriyaki chicken with pasta fared much better - chicken was tender and well-marinated. Yoghurt turned out to be pretty enjoyable. 
It\'s a jiggly Pandan Panna Cotta with a cannelle of vanilla gelato, a pipette of gula melaka, swish of passionfruit and strawberry marshmallow sauce and of course a Hello Kitty White Chocolate.
How about a Hello Kitty \"Big Breakfast Surprise\"? It has a Hello Kitty Waffles with cheddar, scrambled eggs, shiitake mushrooms, smoked duck with honey lime maple syrup that you can pour over the waffles and go \"Wah Wah\" while you Instagram it. \n<br />It\'s open 24 hours and there is a reduced menu from midnight to early morning. This breakfast surprise is available all day. Meow.....
A simple snack of cheesey sausages wrapped in puff pastry and complemented by a Japanese sesame dip. Presentation, full marks – it fits the rustic nature theme of Hello Kitty Orchid Garden so perfectly.

I was expecting something more colourful or at least the components on the plate resembles the colours of a rainbow. Anyway the dish comes wth mesclun salad, portobello mushrooms, pineapple, jackfruit, feta cheese, pine nuts and dressed in a laksa mustard vinaigrette. I like the idea of using the jackfruit, giving the salad a fruity and refreshing finishing. The laksa mustard vinaigrette was rather light, giving it a slight lift in flavour.

Hehe. \n<br />What\'s up for lunch on your side?
The Hello Kitty waffles comes with cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs, shiitake mushrooms, smoked duck and honey lime maple syrup. I like how the subtle zest on top of the maple syrup sweetness enriched the whole experience.
A sweet happy way to end the night at the world\'s first newly opened 24-hours Hello Kitty Cafe. \n<br />Chocolate gelato, hazelnut gelato, graham crackers, matcha powder, muesli and Hello Kitty chocolate to round up this cute dessert.
NEH
The toasted tortilla shell together with the choice of ingredietns is a delectable combination.
pandan flavored with gula melaka, comes with crumbs and a chocolate kitty
It comes with a scoop of chocolate gelato and hazelnut gelato. Graham crackers is stacked onto the gelato to make it looks like a hut. The green tea powder and toasted muesli is designed to look like the camp fire.
The Cowabunga Wagyu ($24) is one of the few Asian influenced dishes on the menu. The dish comes with Japanese rice, wagyu beef rendang, onions and pineapple. The beef can be more tender and I would prefer the spices mix to be more spicy. This is also the most expensive item on the menu.
Good morning folks. Have a great public holiday and weekend. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #latte #coffee #hellokitty #hellokittyorchidgarden #changiairport
