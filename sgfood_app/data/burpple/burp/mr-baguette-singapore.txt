Goodness oozing out.. Love how they heat up it for me (think hot baguette, warm molten chocolate down your throat). Baguette was a lil hard but crispy. Def a must try!!
Leaving Mr Baguette without trying their lava baguettes ($1.80) is simply a no-no. Just looking at these baguettes will get you salivating. This humble little stall in Golden Mile Food Centre offers both sweet and savoury baguettes, so you\'re not going to miss out if you don\'t have a sweet tooth. Imagine biting into a mini hot, crusty baguette, and having a copious amount of luscious molten chocolate or red velvet filling flow out ‚Äì oh so irresistible. They\'re rather innovative here; flavours include cheese, tiramisu and cookies and cream. These little babies can be brought home and reheated as well, so you can enjoy them from the comfort of your home. ;)
Finally got to try this! Loved the generous amount of oozing hot chocolate but the baguette\'s a little too hard imo. 
having egg custard in a pie crust is an ordinary thing. how about having egg custard in a baguette ? hmm.. eat while it is still hot and taste the crispiness baguette in every bite.
The red velvet filling oozes out readily when you bite into it. Taste chocolatey with a slight touch of cheese. Still prefer their cheese baguette out of all their flavours!
Finally got to try this! If only they had made it hotter and the cheese was more flowy (but less flowy also means less oil which is a good thing) I love the baguette\'s crunchy exterior and the softness of the bread and the creamy cheesy interior. Yum!
The chocolate baguette! See how much chocolate lava flowing out! Its so so good! üòçüòçüòç
The lava end up on my nose when i was trying to eat it üòÇ
More hybrid food? Baguette x lava cake! Comes in many flavors, I have red velvet and chocolate here! 
What a nifty idea: bake baguettes in the shape of small round buns, hollow them out and fill them with something exciting. I chose the Red Velvet Lava ($1.80) from the wide variety of flavours available, and it was good! As the stall-owner heated it up in the oven before giving it to me, the lava filling was dramatic, flowing out non-stop with each bite of the thin, crusty bread. The blend of cocoa, beetroot and yogurt in the lava filling tasted fresh too. On my list to try next are the Chocolate Lava, and the White Chocolate &amp; Mint Lava.
The taste, texture and experience of eating this baguette is irreplaceable. Try the red velvet and cheese for your life changing hawker dessert as cheap as $1.8!!
Tried the green tea azuki, hazelnut chocolate and 4 cheese flavours! Might be a little gelat if you eat it alone although it looks small üò≥
Tried the tiramisu, apple, hazelnut and also cheese lava which were really good, so much so I preferred them to cupcakes or egg tarts. \n<br />Best of all, it\'s situated in Golden Mile FC which also means lower price of $1.80 per piece. They also offered savoury flavours like carbonara and chicken bolognese which tasted awesome. #burpple #burpplesg #mrbaguette #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today

Serving both sweet and savory baguettes, there\'s definitely something for everyone. From top right, Chocolate, Red Velvet, Egg Tart and Cheese. Some others they have are Green Tea, Apple and Cookies &amp; Cream. Innovative and affordable, comes with instructions for reheating too! 
A yummy surprise to find it so liu-y in the middle of the crunchy baguette.

This is the custard one i think üòÅ
Taste so so good
Or as they would call it a Bag-tart! Freshly baked with wobbly custardy egg tart filling in a crusty baguette piece. Have to say it\'s strangely and perhaps surprisingly yummy. Quite clever this! | #food #foodie #foodpic #foodporn #foodvsco #baguette #eggtart #hybridfood #freshbake #vscocam #vscocamsg #vscocollections #vscofood
