Pretty pricey and no seating space so you have to stand and eat, but the quality of the gelato is pretty good!! 
Because I always pig out to the point I never have enough space for dessert haha (oops). üôä
Somehow never posted about BOP before but it\'s surely one of my favorite places to go to for ice creams (if only it wasn\'t so far)! Their range of scoops here are all less sweet than usual, mostly the more light and refreshing sort with botanical elements. Flavours are less seen else where too, you can expect tubs of Basil, Spiced Pear, Vanilla with Figs, etc. Always difficult to make decisions here because almost everything\'s so good!! But my favorites to go for so far are the White Chrysanthemum (they\'ve cocoa nibs in it) and Lychee Raspberry.
Ice cream !!! I got double scoop ~ pistachio and white chrysanthemum. Really good üëç #burpple #burpplesg #firsttimetrying
Had to drop by since I am in the area ‚Äî again, another flavour that hits the spot from Birds of Paradise Gelato; light hints of lychee with raspberry swirls that provides for a light hint of berry tartness. Think of it as their twist to the Raspberry Swirl ice-cream with a Lychee fusion; pretty appealing.
Double scoop: lemongrass &amp; Camomile + ginger flower 
Had the double scoops white chrysanthemum and lychee raspberry flavours ($7.70) in cone (+$1). Love their white chrysanthemum! Unique and refreshing with very familiar chrysanthemum fragrant. \n<br />Lychee raspberry had a stronger lychee flavour. Feels a little \"jerlat\" towards the end because it is on the sweeter side.\n<br />Their thyme Cone were made fresh on the spot. It is on the softer (brittle) side, not something i will rave about thou.\n<br />Great ice cream overall!
Finally got to trying this ice cream store after hearing much rave reviews. Famed for its quality and unique local flavours, it\'s worth a try.
‚Ä¢\n<br />I love almost all their floral flavours but chrysanthmum and spiced pear are definitely on another level. It\'s literally like eating a pear and drinking chrysanthmum tea, just in ice cream form. Ultra creamy, aromatic and flavourful without being too cloyingly sweet, its the perfect way to bring a smile to anyone face.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Costing $7.70 for a double scoop, I highly recommend adding a dollar for their thyme cones that they make fresh. it adds a crunch and a well-received aromatic fragrance.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Expect a long line whatever time you go but its well worth the wait.
Every visit to Birds Of Paradise Gelato Boutique is a game of chance. What you are in the mood for and what they have at that moment do not always coincide. But on my most recent drop-in, they did. Hooray!
üç¶\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Based on a botanical theme that runs in both their thyme Cone &amp; ice cream Flavours. Their White Chrysanthemum is universally loved. Basil that lingers nicely &amp; light on your palate. ü§§\n<br />. \n<br />The Mango Sorbet is Refreshing Orgasmic especially in a scorching sunny weather. It isn\'t too sweet, taste just like what you\'d expect, just pure Mango &amp; no nonsense. üññüèª
Can never pass up getting a thyme infused cone and gelato/sorbet when visiting the east. The waffle cones are so fragrant, you can smell them cooking from the bridge crossing the road to Birds of Paradise. There\'s still an insane queue for the gelato even minutes before the shop closes. White Chrysanthemum seems to be a popular choice, but I prefer the fruity flavours like Mango and Lychee Raspberry.
Birds of Paradise Gelato Boutique has a queue that doesn\'t seem to cease until the sign on their door is flipped from \"Open\" to \"Close\". Even then, it doesn\'t stop latecomers from gazing through the glass with deep longing in their eyes. \n<br />I notice their flavours tend to spark healthy debates with everyone eagerly expounding on why such-and-such are their favourites (it\'s never just one). For me, the White Chrysanthemum and the Lychee &amp; Raspberry have called out loudest during my recent visits. On my radar to get next are the Chocolate and the Strawberry &amp; Basil. Had a tease of both and I can\'t wait to dig into proper big scoops of them.
We got the lychee raspberry &amp; lemongrass ginger and each mouthful was a delight, leaving me wanting more. Their ice creams are smooth and creamy and worth the rel high price for. It was additional wait for their special thyme cone but the infusion of herbs shone through, making for a yummy crispy cone that\'s worth the extra dollar\n<br />‚ö†Ô∏è Went on a Saturday evening and the queue was looong - evidence of their high standard &amp; popularity - and we waited 30 minutes\n<br />üìç@bopgelato, 63 East Coast Road #01-05, S428776
A Thursday afternoon treat~ Can\'t ever leave this store w/o getting their heavenly smelling thyme cones! Vanilla &amp; fig is prolly my most fav flavor from here! ü§ó
Finally, I\'ve been here and I think this place deserves all the hype.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I\'m captivated by all the floral scent - in both the gelato and the cone. The white chrysanthemum, cinnamon in the gelato, and thyme infused cone are all natural and delicate. Better still, it\'s priced lower than many Italian gelato.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This is one classy ice cream.
Any time is ICE CREAM TIME!! So have to reward ourselves with these botanical inspired gelato after walking in the scorching hot sun. Gotten a Double Scoop that includes everyone\'s favourite White Chrysanthemum and light fruity Lychee Raspberry. Even after a full meal we just can\'t help but enjoy them with great pleasure, especially Ms Yong!
One more day to get the Chamomile with Torched Ginger Blossoms from Birds of Paradise at the Singapore Tea Festival 2017. It\'s happening tomorrow from 10am - 10pm at Ion Orchard Level B4.
Glad that the ginger flavour wasnt too strong. The chamomile aroma was pretty decent as well
Cos its served in a cup and frozen, it\'s harder than usual so i wont comment on the texture. The subtle chrysanthemum flavour was apparent and the cacao nibs(raw form of chocolate) brings a nice crunch
The strawberry basil and white chrysanthemum was a perfect combination and it leaves a refreshing taste in your mouth. The boutique was so pretty that it makes one wanting to stay in for some people-watching.
Love the botanical theme &amp; on a quest to try all the Flavours! üññüèª
This small and chic gelato shop serves fruity gelato with a slight Asian twist. I found the vanilla and fig gelato totally amazing. It was very creamy and had generous chunks of dried fig. The strawberry basil gelato is very refreshing; however, it might not suit everyone\'s taste. This is partly because the basil kicks in quite quickly, and it might take some time getting used to it. I also noticed that the strawberry basil ice cream did not have a creamy texture like the vanilla and fig. The texture seemed more icy and, to a certain extent, chunky. Regardless, I think the flavors are very unique and I would come here again! I would really recommend this place because the gelato here is refreshing and very light!
This takeaway-only shop in Katong serves what we think is hands-down the best botanical-inspired gelato. We are constantly in awe of how they creatively combine unique flavours flawlessly. Priced at $4.70 per scoop, the gelato manages to be both creamy and light at the same time, and you are likely to love what you order. Some of the Burpple community\'s favourites include the White Chrysanthemum peppered with cacao nibs, Lychee Raspberry and the timeless combination of Strawberry Basil. Feel free to ask to try the flavours before ordering to discover your favourite! Add on $1 for the Thyme Cone, which they make in-house. It is aromatic and subtly earthy, and the perfect cone to house the gelato. Truth be told, we sometimes make the long journey to Katong simply to inhale the freshly-made waffle cone aroma, no joke.\n<br />Avg Price: $5 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Kar Yan Yeong
Chance upon this gelato shop while having dinner along that stretch. There was a crowd even at 10pm. Ordered pandan flavour as during the ice cream tasting this stand out. It taste exactly like coconut with a nice fragrant in the mouth. However, when eating a spoonful of it from the cone, it give a bitter aftertaste which is kind of disappointing. Overall, the freshly made cone and variety of ice cream is recommended. But for this set, its pricey @ $5.70.
After hearing so much i decided to try it out. Ice cream was light and refreshing with some cacao nibs
Welcomed me as I stepped in were interesting flavours that are really naturally refreshing especially on a hot afternoon, beautifully painted wall and smiles from the staff. It was such a great experience to visit this another gelato haven! üòçüòòüíï\n<br />#burpple #simplejoys #icecreamislife
Mint Cacao gelato with a thyme cone. This is the iteration of mint chocolate chip you want to eat forever. #burpple #bopgelato
I liked their lychee raspberry very much so decided to get one pint home. Their ice cream is light and if you like lychee, this must try!
üç¶üç¶üç¶ L to R: White Chrysanthemum // Spiced Pear // Raspberry Lychee ($4.70 per scoop, $1 for cone). Gelato here lean towards the lighter side of the palette - and they taste exactly the way they are named!! üòç Chrysanthemum ended up being my fave (like having light creamy tea)! Only thing missing in this place is some seats to cosy up in and life force imbuing coffeeee ‚òïÔ∏è #burpple
Another day spent in the East is not complete without a scoop of ice cream from BOP! Even if you\'re completely stuffed from your weekend brunch, you cannot resist the selection of unique flavours available. The delicious smell that emanates out of their narrow shop is an added bonus!

Spiced pear pleasantly surprised me and made me crave for more.
Really adore the tiny flowers and figs I discovered as I dived into the finest quality gelato ever! They really have their way in putting their spin on healthy botanical flavours. Small tip: take a chill in their shop to finish your ice cream - the gelato doesn\'t melt as quickly when you\'re in an air conditioned area üòä
$4.70 + $1 for the cone. Its superb and they have interesting flavours that i never come across outside. They say their popular flavour is the pear. But i prefer lychee. :)
Tried their lychee rapsberry flavour gelato which is really worth trying. Will be back for other flavours for sure like basil one.
hen in Katong... In pic is the white chrysanthemum and strawberry basil in thyme cone (forgot the price but its just below $10) \n<br />Verdict: Not very sweet and naturally refreshing so its the perfect heat-relief when you feel like getting naughty but healthy on a hot hot midday! The wafer smelled heavenly in the shop but tastes like wafer lor...I wouldn\'t mind having this more often if not for the price üòù, I\'ll just stick to my weekly ice-cream wafers on wheels for now.
The gelato flavours here are really good and they have rather unique flavours too. The thyme cone is fragrant and tastes yummy too!
Exotic, unique flavour + thyme flavoured cone was worth the slightly more expensive price!!
Finally made plans to drop by BOP for more of their cold treats! I got the Hazelnut this time, which was nothing short of stunning. üòç Even though the flavour was robust and rich in hazelnut (think a stronger flavour of Kinder Bueno\'s cream), it was still perfectly restrained, which kept it from being overpowering. It couples really nicely with the savoury thyme cone too. I feel they were subtly complementary of each other. üòã (8/10)
Recommending the gelato (S$4.70) here as it leaned towards the less-sweet side. The lychee flavored plus its fragrance with a tinge of pinkish raspberry is my cup of tea. Together with the Thyme Waffle Cone (additional S$1), it really enhanced the gelato overall!
üç¶7.5/10üç¶\n<br />.\n<br />This takeaway-only ice cream boutique dishes out botanical-focused flavours - think white chrysanthemum, strawberry basil. While most of the flavours taste exactly as they are named, we thought the spiced pear was the most interesting of them all. It was also light and not too sweet, although $5.70 is a tad too expensive for a return visit anytime soon!
.\n<br />While my friend was excitedly raving over the White Chrysanthemum and Spiced Pear flavor, i took a mouthful and went, \"Orh \'ju hua\' ice cream lor\".\n<br />.\n<br />But the freshly made Thyme Cone left an impression with its crispy crust and subtle thyme fragrance.
Revamping the classic Vanilla! Adding on generous bits of figs definitely uplifted the flavors but not losing the nostalgic familiar taste üíï I recommend going for the thyme come rather than the cups as their so crispy &amp; fragrant!
Pretty amazing waffle cone that\'s freshly made on the spot with thyme herbs. The mint cacao has nice cacao bits in it. Plus the pistachio is from Italy, looks more yellow than green. Super yummy!
This place has been picking up traction on Burpple pretty fast in the last couple of weeks, so I decided to drop by and check it out.
Featuring the chrysanthemum cacao flavour which is so light that it tastes like a guilt-free treat. This is how ice-cream should be made.
All-time favourite fruity lychee raspberry &amp; \"flowers-in-my-mouth\" White Chrysanthemum. Will do anything for this right now with this weather ‚òÑÔ∏è 
I loved to surprise myself so I got the Lemongrass Ginger in their signature Thyme Cone without sampling the flavour beforehand. I would say that the lemongrass ginger might not be a flavour for everyone, but it fit my tastebud perfectly, despite the food-coma after dinner. Being the more dominant flavour, the lemongrass was rather citrusy while the ginger enhanced the earthy zest in the gelato. And that thyme cone was really creative, looking forward to more innovations from them! :)
Really interesting flavors (I loved the basil strawberry!) but definitely on the pricier side. It\'s also a very small shop with no seats.
Not overly sweet and very refreshing, smooth, creamy. The thyme cone is quite special and brings a refreshing touch to the ice-cream. This is how ice cream should be made!
$4.70 Mango Sorbet\n<br />Rich, creamy and smooth. Taste wise it needs a little more acid. Its a little too expensive for my liking. Could be a dollar cheaper and itll be the perfect price
Spending our Christmas weekend with sweet treats from our favorite gelato boutique (3rd on Burpple\'s Hot 100 Cafes &amp; Restaurants 2016!!) ‚Äî Raspberry Lychee, White Chrysanthemum with Raw Cacao Bits, Spiced Pear and Strawberry Basil with lychee being the clear favorite of the night üòã
Located some distance away (walkable distance) from Parkway Parade, Birds of Paradise offers ice cream that combines your oh-so usual flavours like strawberry with floral elements! There\'s White Chrysanthemum, and others flavours mixed with figs. 
Tried this place after hearing raves about this place, the flavours were all so intriguing and sampled a few before settling on a simple mango sorbet ($4.70). The other flavours? I felt was really interesting to taste but I don\'t think I could do a whole scoop of some of them! The mango on the other hand, was perfectly not too sweet and refreshing. Definitely worth a taste if you\'re in the area!
You need to go to the store to smell how delicious the cone was when they made it. üòç I\'ve never had a thyme cone, so go and try if you haven\'t üòå
Not sure if this is new but certainly hadn\'t tried this flavour so I have got myself a scoop to try. Perhaps one of the most aromatic Vanilla flavours I have ever had ‚Äî the richness of the vanilla itself was simply alluring that it sealed the deal. The fibrous figs were actually pretty \"civilized\" here in the way that they never ever tried stealing the show away from the vanilla; it tries to add it a subtle hint of prune-like flavours here and there at areas with nibs of fig around.
\nStumble upon this beautiful 3 months old shop. Wow!! Tasted the best mango gelato ever! Wish they could set up a bigger space to dine-in and chill. Next in the list will be the Lychee &amp; Strawberry flavor. See you soon.... 
We got 4 different flavours to try: Mango Sorbet, Strawberry &amp; Basil, Raspberry Ripple and Pandan and they were all so good! The more interesting Strawberry &amp; Basil and Pandan I think may need some getting used to but the tried and true more \'classic\' flavours are üëå!! Wish they would have indoor seating, but the shop itself is super aesthetic and instagram-able! The price of $4.70 per scoop was not a bad price for good gelato too in my opinion.
I love their bold, yet understated flavours‚ÄîStrawberry Basil and White Chrysanthemum (with cacao nibs!!) on a fragrant homemade thyme cone. And that clean Scandi-chic space üëå #goodvibes
Seriously had a hard time choosing the flavours at BOP Gelato cause they all taste so good!!!!! Forced myself to take the Pistachio (+$1) this time round (otherwise I would have gone straight for White Chrysanthemum) and I sure didn\'t regret it. Those nuts sure weren\'t crushed in vain as they added a well-bodied roasty flavor to the ice cream. Mint lovers should definitely go for this Mint Cocoa that is light and refreshing. Also, highly recommend the freshly made Thyme cone (+$1). This double scoop costs $9.90 ($7.90+$1+$1).
Raving reviews for the gelato here so am glad I finally  dropped by today. Offering exotic botany flavours such as Strawberry Basil &amp; White Chrysanthemum, they are sold at $4.70 per scoop and $7.70 for double. Love the latter which has floral taste of chrysanthemum but not over empowering plus bits of cocoa nibs. Freshly made cones actually thyme flavour and can be added for just $1.
.\n<br />Travelling all the way down from the west, I, of course, wanted to try the unique botany-themed flavours while my friend wanted good ole chocolate so we compromised and got a double scoop ($7.70) with Birds Of Paradise‚Äôs signature crisp thyme-infused waffle cone for an extra dollar.
The strawberry basil was very refreshing. The combination seemed odd at first but they go well together. Also very impressed with the lychee raspberry. One disappointing thing was that there were no seatings :(
Fel: It\'s very addictive! \n<br />Me: Are you sure? I prefer creamy ice cream. \n<br />Fel: Tell me after you try it. 
It\'s rare that I end up at Katong at this hour on a weekday, and therefore a stopover at Birds of Paradise is a must. Went for this rather subtle flavour here that is close to the heart ‚Äî coming in a pale, pastel green hue you could probably tell how painstaking the process of making this gelato is as compared to simply using an essence for flavour. The result is a fairly unadulterated, fresh but very light and refreshing Pandan flavour amidst the smooth and creamy texture of the gelato; not really noticeable at the start but it grows on after a few scoops and you would really feel the flavours come to life by the end of the entire scoop. Definitely worked as a lighter tasting post-dessert dessert without the guilt after having the Banana Pie from Dona Manis at Katong Shopping Centre!
This could easily be my favourite gelato shop with its bright cheery decor, and the most interesting botanical flavoured gelatos! \n<br />Lychee Raspberry was our love-at-first-taste for that sweet, lychee fragrance, but had a subtle savoury taste (can\'t put my finger to it.. like cream cheese?!). After what seemed like forever cos\' everything was so good we couldn\'t decide, we finally agreed on the White Chrysanthemum. Distinct floral taste that was slightly sweet but well-balanced with bits of bitter, cacao nibs, giving a good crunch to the creamy gelato. And that is no ordinary cone - freshly made on the spot, the thyme-infused cone (+$1) was aromatic, light and stayed crispy throughout. \n<br />Definitely bringing my cooler bag to lug a few pints home the next time!!üòõ(They\'re having a promotion for their pints at $13.60(?) instead of $16.) 
A combination of both sweet &amp; somewhat savory ice cream, this combination is perfect for Sunday\'s chill vibes üòå
welcome the new addition to the sprawling cafes in the east area ; a gelato bar with very unique botany flavours like white chrysanthemum &amp; strawberry basil! \n<br />the cafe has a very minimalistic interior w pastel hues and it\'s very pretty inside!! \n<br />I ordered a classic creamy sweet Mango, and it was really good!! 
Think White Chrysanthemum &amp; Cacao Nibs, Lychee Raspberry, Strawberry Basil, Spiced Pear and Pistachio. \n<br />Pssst! if you\'re a fan of their Pandan Gelato (the owner\'s personal favourite), next batch will be available early this week ü§ì. 4.7bucks/scoop\n<br />7.7bucks/double scoop\n<br />1buck/thyme cone\n<br />#FTrecommends
Thyme is one of my favourite herbs, so seeing the thyme cone posts on Burpple instantly piqued my taste buds\' curiosity. üôáüèª\n<br />With the choice of cone sorted, I sampled the botanical inspired assortment searching for a complementary flavour. The affable guy at the counter suggested the refreshing Basil, but it was the impeccable balance of delicate flavours in Strawberry Basil that won me over ‚Äî that bracing lift from the herb made all the difference. üíò I don\'t even like strawberry-flavoured dairy products as they tend to have that off-putting artificial taste, but this had none of that nonsense.
Hearing about a white chrysanthemum gelato had me üëÄ and I was definitely making a trip down to check Birds Of Paradise out.
Offering up to ten scoop varieties daily, each flavour infused with either a flower, herb or spice. \n<br />Everything tasted so great but I finally settled on the Lychee with Raspberry swirl and (my current fave!) White Chrysanthemum studded with unsweetened raw cacao nibs. \n<br />Does get pretty sweet especially if (you\'re greedy like me) you ordered two heaping scoops, so be sure to help yourself to their house-brewed lychee black tea that\'s stationed by the window pane. üç¶‚òïÔ∏è Ma girls @arentijustawesome @coffeevicinity only recommend the good stuff!

Birds of Paradise Gelato Boutique may just a couple of weeks old, but they are already getting quite a bit of attention, thanks to memorable gelato flavours like the refreshing Spiced Pear and the creamy Strawberry Basil. This tiny scoop shop, really more of a takeaway counter, is located within the recently restored The Red House Katong and serves nine original, herb-infused flavours on rotation daily. Stop by on a hot day for a lick of the Spiced Pear Gelato ($4.70 per scoop) while marveling at the gorgeous botanical wallpaper in the shop or reward yourself with a double scoop (you deserve it!) of the Mint Cacao ($4.70 per scoop) and White Chrysanthemum ($4.70 per scoop) on their flavourful Thyme-infused Cone ($1) to go! \n<br />Avg price: $5 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Irina Tan
2nd visit here within a week because this place is just too. Damn. Convenient. Though our socks were thoroughly blown off by the flavour of the spiced pear the first time we went, the texture was lacking in creaminess. This gelato however, balanced both strawberry and basil flavours wonderfully, neither overpowering the other. The strawberry was more sweet than zingy (which i appreciate), and so gentler on the palate. This time, the texture was also softer and creamier. We\'ve started things off very well here.
So greedy me couldn\'t pick just one flavour to have, and since they offer fresh Thyme Cones for I was early and they didn\'t have any, I decided why not go for two scoops instead ‚Äî one in a cup and one in a Thyme Cone (it\'s the only cone available and costs an additional $1 more). If you are one who prefers fruity flavours but can\'t do with a sorbet (which fully describes myself btw), this is it; the Spiced Pear isn\'t quite like the White Chrysanthemum where it faded out with milkiness ‚Äî the flavours actually managed to stay through the end and it\'s rather refreshing for a cream-based gelato where you could actually taste how fresh it is; almost akin to biting into an actual pear with a little hint of spices such as the Star Anise and Cinnamon added into it. Admittedly this flavour isn\'t the best combination to pair the Spiced Pear gelato with ‚Äî a little too strong as the herbed flavours felt blanketed by the gelato, but you could still taste the fragrant buttermilk batter and the flavours of the herb when you reach the bottom. Both things are items I would go back for, but perhaps the next time I shall leave the Spiced Pear gelato in a cup while perhaps pair the Thyme Cone up with the Basil gelato instead.
It\'s hard to find an ice-cream parkour with a personality around, but Birds Of Paradise Gelato is a rare breed that has its own unique style, offering botany-themed flavours which often involves herbs and fresh ingredients in the making of their gelato with rather curious flavour combinations (e.g. Basil, Pandan, Mint Cacao). This is the White Chrysanthemum ‚Äî I visited them shortly after they have opened thus the gelato\' texture is still a little harder to scoop thus the aesthetic of the gelato. This tastes very rather unique at the start ‚Äî it hints of gentle flavours of the flower itself; quite almost the same as actually drinking the pure form of tea itself amidst the creaminess. Thought that the flavours could be brought out a little stronger as the creaminess soon takes over after a few spoonfuls but the cacao nibs (not chocolate chips) do help to refresh the White Chrysanthemum flavours a bit by adding a little bittersweetness that you would expect from the cacao nibs in a Acai Bowl. No doubt the White Chrysanthemum flavours can be a little stronger in this one, but this is one flavour I certainly had never come across anywhere else on this island.
Basil Strawberry + Lychee gelato in a handmade thyme-infused cone. GIMME MOREEEEEEE üå∏
This is quite possibly the best flavour of gelato i\'ve had. Very very lightly kissed with star anise and cinnamon, the fruity notes dance on your palette delightfully. While the texture of the gelato isn\'t quite as creamy/luxurious, i actually prefer that it doesn\'t sit heavily in your stomach. Amazing.

But today, I just wanted a single scoop in a cup. ‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Raspberry lychee that was not too sweet. Strong taste of lychee with a hint of zesty raspberry. So good. Just me, myself chilling #inmyhood ... so close to home.

Thinking that it was more worth it to have 2 scoops on one cone, my daughter and I shared a double cone. There were so many unique flavours to choose from, mostly botanical inspired. Thankfully you can sample the flavours before deciding. No rude stares as I sampled just about every flavour available before deciding on strawberry basil and lychee raspberry.\n<br />*\n<br />The cone was infused with thyme and was made on the spot, in the store itself. In fact, you can smell the aroma of freshly baked cones the minute you step into the store.\n<br />*\n<br />It was a bad idea to order the double cone as each scoop was so large that by the time we got to the second scoop, the cone was already soft üò≠. Take note and don\'t be a penny pincher. Order single cones!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_bopgelato #bopgelato #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Tried many many flavours over the last few months!

Whilst most would hold the cone upright, I chose to savor mine \"lying down\". The thyme cone was aromatic and crispylicious. White chrysanthemum gelato so floral and sweet which made me reminisce my holiday in Japan.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Amidst the stares &amp; a snigger or two, I thought my \"thyme\" with the cone was truly enjoyable. What can I say? I like to be different.
thyme cone!

Raspberry lychee ... alittle dainty for a thin crispy waffle cone. Thyme was added to the batter. I tell you, the aroma of the cone (whilst it was still cooking) whiffs thru the air and filled the whole creamery with an umami fragrance. Smells pretty addictive.

Its flavour remains distinct even with the presence of the woody accents of cinnamon and the herbal spiciness of star anise, a fruit of an evergreen oriental tree.\n<br />For the light brown Acai Pomegranate gelato, the refreshing zest of acai and pomegranate with chia seeds blended within is a delightful treat but it pales in comparison to its more eccentric neighbour.\n<br />.\n<br />üèö63 East Coast Road 01-05 Singapore 428776\n<br />.\n<br />Opening Hours:\n<br />Tues to Fri 4.30pm to 10.00pm\n<br />Sat to Sun 12.00pm to 10.00pm\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤Cost:\n<br />$4.70 for single scoop\n<br />$7.70 for double scoop\n<br />$16.00 for pint\n<br />.\n<br />#igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood  #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #igfoodies #foodgram #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #vscofeed #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #exploresingapore #singapore #singaporefoodie\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg
I recommend the spiced pear, white chrysanthemum and the lychee raspberry. My pal @rachelleemunyee has been coming here for 6 weekends straight, which is a shoutout to how good it is considering she stays in the far West! She was also the one who brought me here. Definitely an icecream worth traveling for!! @bopgelato please give her some commission haha. üö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #igfood #igeats #foodislove #hungrygowhere #burpple #burppleSG #sgfood #sgeats #igsgfood #igsgeats #eatoutsg #singapore #yummy #honestreviews #icecream #bopgelato

We had the Pistachio and White Chrysanthemum, really liked the Thyme Cone which smelt great freshly made!!
Satisfying my sweet tooth... üòã
Featured here is the strawberry basil and pistachio. #tingzieeats #burpple
both flavours were uber yummy! thyme cone on point üòã
üç¶ \n<br />Fantastic flavors found here at Birds Of Paradise. \n<br />The Lychee was very pronounced with nice swirls of raspberry which gave it a kick of sweetness - its a really nice and light flavour. Spiced Pear is sweeter but still light and tastes strongly of pear üçêand has a creamy texture. Loved the Thyme cone as well which had its own earthy flavor. Extremely worth the price. *\n<br />Shoutout to the staff who gave me an EXTRA cone because I dropped mine (even though I was close to finishing it). Excellent service I\'m definitely going back if I\'m ever found in the east area. Please hold your cones tightly people haha! ‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #burppleSG #sgfood #instafood #sgfoodies #eatoutsg #openricesg #myfab5 #exploresingapore #sgdesserts #icecream #gelato #artisangelato #sgicecream #SGmakandiary #foodhunter #foodstagram #heartytastyworthy #hypebeast #burpproved #singaporeinsiders #whati8today #tslmakan #snapseedfood #buzzfeast #f52grams #bestdessert  #birdsofparadise #katong

There are many new flavours that you don\'t see anywhere else. However a little disappointment experience as I\'ve queued for the waffle cone but they\'ve run out of itüò≠ Nevertheless, these are made with good quality gelato ingredients eg. smooth and creamy milk taste and they don\'t melt so easilyüëçüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.
Wait no more! #burpple #bopgelato
I like this more than G. üòù Ate their white chrysanthemum gelato ($4.70/scoop) Ate so much these 2 days and I\'m down to 40kg.

This is the White Chrysanthemum with Thyme Cone\n<br />.\n<br />#birdsofparadise #icecream #gelato #dessert #oriental #whitechrysanthemum #thyme #intense #whati8today #foodie #katong #east #dessertlover #iloveicecream #burpple #burpplesg
Besides the floral infusion from the tea florets, there was the surprise of the cacao nibs from each bite, making it a killer combination with that thyme cone. The other flavour that we have gotten was the Strawberry Basil but the White Chrysanthemum still wins it hands down. A double scoop gelato with the thyme cone costs $8.70.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Birds of Paradise\n<br />Address: 63, East Coast Road, Unit 01-05, Singapore 428776 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #bopgelato #gelato #birdsofparadise

Strawberry Basil($4.70)¬† Love the botanical flavours available- so different, yet refreshing! The whole set-up was very clean and pleasing as well! Staff were slightly inexperienced though, but generally friendly and willing to help.
Treat yo self to icecream! White Chrysanthemum Gelato (floral infusion of white chrysanthemum florets &amp; sprinkle of cacao nibs) w the signature Thyme Cone (house-made waffle cone infused w thyme). #throwback #latergram #sabbyisafoodie #burpple #igsg #sgig #instadaily #instagood #instafood #instadessert #dessertsg #sgeats #sgfoodie #icecream #gelato #foodie #foodiegram #foodiesg #treatyoself #happy #shiok #yummy #birdsofparadise #bopgelato #singapore #sg
With a range of signature flavours derived from botanical ingredients; fruits, flowers, herbs and spices... you can find interesting gelato flavours like Basil, Pandan, Spiced Pear and Lychee Raspberry (which is my favourite for it is so refreshing and has that sweet lychee taste). Their instagram-worthy cups are made from sugarcane pulp after juice extraction! So #ecofriendly #bopgelato #gelato #yummy #onmytable #sgcafe #love #topcitybites #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #beautifulcuisines #burpple
Couldn\'t stop raving about my Raspberry Lychee &amp; Thyme cone!!! The interior of the store is absolutely delightful too. @bopgelato | #bopgelato #burpple #whati8today #gelato #botanical #gelato #gif #saturday #fatdieme
The pear gelato is authentically gritty and textured, whilst the Strawberry Basil would likely inspire a trip to the nearest Mount Sapola outlet.
Gelato is made fresh onsite. Flavors are botanically inspired and all natural without preservatives. Exotic flavors include basil, spiced pear, white chrysanthemum, mango sorbet etc.\n<br />üåº\n<br />A choice of scoops in cups or cone. A scoop costs $4.70 and if it is on a cone..add another $1. What I had was the chrysanthemum gelato with raw cacao nibs. Floral and atad sweet, crunch from the cacao. The cone u have got to try. Thin &amp; crisp with bits of thyme....yes .. the herbie thyme. A sweet n savory and kinda east meets west exotic combi.\n<br />üåº\n<br />Original is a scoop on the cone. I played with my food. Yup..thinking out of the coneüòÑ. At the moment, this shop is opened at 4.30 pm everyday except for mondays which is their rest day. Located beside the iconic Redhouse at 63 East Coast Road.
