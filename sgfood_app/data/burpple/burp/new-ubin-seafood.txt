Got ourselves 16 pieces of fragrant prawn paste chicken in this large serving (2 for each of us because how can 1 be enough)! Always my dish to go for at any zi char eateries, New Ubin did theirs well - crunchy coating, juicy meat and just the right amount of saltiness.
We were mostly surprised by the price tag of this popular zi char dish here at New Ubin - $18 for Small with 4 pieces of oysters or $36 for Large for 8 pieces, but that was justified by the use of larger sized fresh oysters. The omelette was crisp, fluffy and seasoned well, but not the starchy sort, leaning more towards ‘orh neng’. Not sure if we’ll want to pay for it again though, I’d go for fresh raw oysters instead!
Chicken was well-marinated and not overly salty, while the batter was light, crispy, and not too oily. Super addictive and a must-have at every zi char meal!
It’s not often that you get to order angus beef when eating tze char. New Ubin offers it served alongside wedges and caramelised onions which is definitely something interesting to have when eating tze char. The beef has conveniently been cut into cubes for you - each piece is tender and juicy and pretty tasty. However, the price may get pretty steep especially if you’re ordering a large portion for a big group. This was good, but I would say they have nicer dishes on their menu!
I really liked how the chye poh pieces gave the chewy kway teow a crunchier texture with each bite. Also a bonus (for those who like it) were the huge chunks of crispy fried lard that dotted the whole dish. While delicious, this place is quite far out and the other dishes can be a bit pricey.
The Chye Poh (preserve radish) &amp; garlic comes in so nicely &amp; fills your palate with that umami Aroma. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />Masterfully Fried with exceptional control of the wok &amp; fire temperature. Which make this a Must Order when you are here @newubinseafood even when the large pieces of lard might send you straight to the hospital due to clogging arteries but so worth it, it\'s okay I got insurance so one more plate please. 🖖🏻
4.5 munchies: With such strong wok hei in this show-stopping dish, every bite of the QQ rice noodles filled our mouths with a nice garlicky fragrance as well as a savoury finish from the preserved radish. The Chye Poh Kuay Teow is a dish that is so simple, yet so wonderfully executed. It is best paired with our locally-brewed Rye &amp; Pint Sunday\'s Brew – a sweet malt pilsner with crisp citrus aroma that complements the savoury fried noodles perfectly. How more Singaporean can you get?

They always make a better version of something, and then you will and can never settle for anything less. 😭😭😭 Just like these divine prawn vadai. Hand-ground chickpea, spices, and fresh, plump prawns...deep-fried to perfection. They now have to deliver to me on a daily basis. Ok, that\'s all.
The dish that was the least exciting sounding of the lot during New Ubin Seafood &amp; The Drinking Partners\' zi char &amp; craft beer brunch, but believe me when I say that the flavors present in this plate was a force o\' nature.
My curiosity was instantly aroused when I saw \'Babi Pongteh\' on New Ubin Seafood\'s Zi Char &amp; Craft Beer Brunch menu, and it was absolutely satisfied once I loaded an indescribably indulgent slice of babi pongteh into my rapacious maw.
New Ubin Seafood definitely does not excel solely in seafood dishes, as this plate of Old Punggol Style Mee Goreng proves without the shadow of a doubt. Normally, your mundane mee goreng is laden with soggy, overcooked thick yellow noodles and a spicy chili paste so spicy it suppresses the other supporting flavors in the plate of noodles. But nossir, you ain\'t gonna get none of that trash in New Ubin\'s peerless plate of mee goreng.
As a guy who detests eggplants unless it has been tempura\'d, New Ubin has done one helluva job of trying to convert me into an aubergine apostle.
At $14/100g, this dish was worth every cent! It came with a side of wedges and their signature heart attack fried rice. The star was definitely the beef as it was cooked to perfection and there was no blood dripping despite it being medium rare. Definitely a must order as both the accompanying wedges and rice were good as well.
Perfectly cooked and served with a plate of fried rice cooked in the beef essences, what more can you ask for? This baby was 650g and was plenty for 7 people.
As you can see, they fry this dish very differently than what you would expect from this classic Hawker dish. It\'s way more crispy and lacks the doughy bits that I actually love. Can\'t comment on the oysters because I don\'t eat them :)
The \"Wok-hey\" (Wok flavour) is awesome! One of the better Bee Hoon dishes that I\'ve had. Highly recommend this dish to go with all the other dishes.
A favourite dish to order whenever you visit any zi char place, and New Ubin does a decent plate of it. Not the best you\'ll have, but still leaves you satisfied and an empty plate.
Always wondered by a place with seafood in its name is more famous for its steaks and now i finally know. Some fabulous steak this was, so incredibly juicy, right amount of bite and lots of flavour from the beef fat. The fried rice isnt much on its own but glad it doesnt oveewhelm the well-seasoned beef in any way
Derived from a family recipe from Da Hong Yun (Potluck), which served traditional Cantonese cuisine from the 1960s to 1992, this claypot rice goes through a few rounds of cooking and \'burning\' before it arrives at your table, ensuring that the rice is infused with the fat of the waxed meat and chicken, and that you get fan chiu (the beautiful crust of burnt rice). Our first bowl of rice was served without any sauce or meat, so we could taste the smokey, flavorful rice. The sauce was mixed in after that, along with the waxed meat and chicken. Listening to the stories of the owners of the recipes, I realized how much care and attention to detail is given to each component of the dish to create the perfect experience for their customers.  You can get this and more at the Claypot Rekindling Dinner at @newubinseafood featuring the Tang Family of Da Hong Yun happening this Wednesday, 12 July 2017 at 7.30pm. Last I heard, only 4 seats are left so make your reservations pronto!\n<br />#burpple #newubinseafood
BUT. We had a special treat last night when the chef brought out another plate of eggplant, this time, topped with beef floss. 3 words to describe it - O. M. G. Unbelievable, as exclaimed by everyone on the table. The beef floss created such depth in flavor, and brought the dish to a whole new level. \n<br />Eggplant with pork floss is part of the Claypot Rekindling Dinner at @newubinseafood featuring the Tang Family of Da Hong Yun happening this Wednesday, 12 July 2017 at 7.30pm. \n<br />As for eggplant with beef floss, you might need to bribe the chef for it. \n<br />#burpple #newubinseafood
Bib Gourmand (Michelin Guide Singapore 2016 &amp; 2017)
The full list here &gt; http://danielfooddiary.com/2017/06/22/bibgourmand2017/
#satay but #foiegras. #micdrop. pop one into your mouth first for pure indulgence. then a cut as spread on the buttered toast. shiok only. definitely a $7 well spent if you ask me.
Despite relocating from Sin Ming to Hillview, the new location has not deterred loyal fans of New Ubin Seafood from going the extra mile(s) for their favourite dishes. The sprawling space that doubles up as a canteen during the day can accommodate 280 seats, which makes this ideal for large gatherings. If you\'re headed here on weekends, make a reservation in advance. First on the list to order: the juicy US Black Angus Ribeye Steak ($14 for 100g) that comes complete with wedges, caramelised onions and beef fried rice (rice fried in beef fat) on the side. It\'s sinful, but incredibly tasty and a definite winner in our books! As for the standard zi char items, our Burpple community loves the tasty Har Cheong Gai (from $15), Salted Egg Squid (from $16) and, if your wallet can afford it, the Chilli Crab (from $42)! \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person \n<br />Photo by Burppler Sarah L
🦐8.5/10🦐\n<br />.\n<br />These were utterly crispy with soft centres! Excellently executed and definitely a dish to order when at New Ubin. Could easily be an after meal snack too 😋
⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️ 🍴Been coming here very often &amp; since it\'s starting days but never posted about it. Their famed beef is as good as ever - juicy and crispy on the top - and paired well with caramelized onions, potato wedges &amp; special rice fried with beef lard.\n<br />⚠️ Called new ubin SEAFOOD but best known for their classic zichar dishes like boss beehoon, mee goreng and shrimp paste chicken so best to order these &gt; seafood\n<br />📍New Ubin Seafood, 63 Hillview Avenue, S669569
Elevating the familiar soft boiled eggs. Super for-value! ⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️
Tangy &amp; spicy. May not be the most authentic but delicious nonetheless ⭐️ 3.5/5 ⭐️
Prawn paste chicken 🐥\n<br />Really crispy, and you can even taste the prawn flavour within the tender meat 😋 ⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️
The crab was fresh, and the flesh are firm. I usually dont eat the whole garlic alone, but i dont mind the whole garlic here. Take my money! 👍🏻4/5 ✔️Probably going try a few more times before i decide, but its really quite taxing compare to normal tze char
🤔 i wonder why is there good review on this. Definitely not the better ones i had. Its lack of salted egg flavour yet very salty. 👍🏻2/5, ✖️Not going to order this again
Crab is big and fresh! Whoopee! Had a good time digging for crab meat. The chilli sauce is alright... just a lil too sweet for us.
Served together with caramelised onions, Idaho potato wedges, sea salt flakes, and fried rice caramelised with beef drippings
Promotion: buy 2 and get 1 more for free!\n<br />We choose the 500gms crab at $42/crab

Beef with beef fat fried rice still as good when they were at the other ulu location #BurppleXChope
I Know everyone raves about the ribeye at new Ubin, and don\'t get me wrong. I like that too. But tried this kway Teow on my last trip to new Ubin before it moved and was mind blown. so sinfully good.
Enjoying this one last time before it moves to Hillview (😭 so far). New Ubin\'s salted egg squid is the bomb. It is really unadulterated salted egg coating tender squid slices. And their hokkien mee is da bomb. Better than the fried rice and steak, which tasted middling this time...
Garlic baked crab - served w generous amount of garlic will certainly satisfy any cravings for garlic. Crab wise seems like a not too impressive pricey steamed crab.\n
Otherwise, how will we ever be crazy enough to do this? Ok, that\'s all.
These caramelised slices of crispy brinjal are simply divine. The sticky glaze — balancing sweet, savoury, spicy and tangy — is God-sent. Quite kua zhang, right? But they\'re really good lah. Ok, that\'s all.
Very addictive. In fact father-in-law and I finish the almost 30 cloves of garlic in this dish. Congratulations to @UbinSeafood for getting the Bib Gourmand award!
Black Angus ribeye steak cubes (we asked for medium doneness) with lightly crispy potato wedges, caramelised onions and fried rice (unpictured). The beef was very nicely seared and boasted tender meat with a good amount of bite....go order this!!!
600gm worth of fresh Scottish blue mussels swimming in garlic butter and white wine. Absolutely fragrant and delightful! Could smell the hint of white wine the moment the dish was served. Comes with slices of bread to soak up the delicious sauce 😄
Lol! 👻😈😱 Garlic Crab 🦀🦀🦀 at our APAC team dinner tonight - simple, yet intensely fragrant and flavorful (I\'ve never been served this much garlic on a plate before!!). Just forget about getting close and intimate with anyone tonight too! 😏😜😲😷
It managed to swim out of the porridge swamp, but it didnt know it was going into our tummy.
Loads of crabs. This is the crab porridge from New Ubin Seafood. Yum.
The boss bee hoon is a must order, and i like how you can have a bowl of Chilli crab sauce for $5! Warning: place is superrrrr packed though. Parking is tough.  
The start for me however was the spicy and crisp eggplant special.  Saw a few groups of friends @erikaliana @veldenneo and a HSBC colleague.  What a small world.
.\n<br />By topping fried seaweed with silver fish over blanched \'kailan\', even the vegetables have the taste of sea from Ubin.
.\n<br />Probably one of the best Grilled Beef in a \'Tze Char\' setting.
Everything here is soooo delicious, that in a short 2 weeks time, we\'ve been back three times! Recommends garlic crab, and their signature steak. Mouthwatering just thinking about it!
20M Whoohoo! 🎉🎄\n<br />#ReferralCandy *
I apologise for the title as I\'m not exactly sure what the official dish name is. But rest assured if you order \"600 grams of the beef\" they will understand what you mean. The bite-sized beef tastes even better than it looks. I\'d recommend using only the salt dip and ignore the rest. Oh and have I mentioned, it also comes with a plate of fried rice that is cooked with the juice from the beef! (Rating:😍)
next visit I will try the promotion : buy 2 crabs get 1 free!
I love yam paste, and the one at New Ubin Seafood is one of the better ones that I\'ve tried. They are very generous with the yam, the Orh Nee is really smooth and doesn\'t taste oily. Drizzle with some coconut milk (served separately) for the ultimate gratification. 
Deep fried succulent pork pieces in sweet and sour sauce -- craving satisfied 😍 I\'m glad the sauce here isn\'t too sweet or ketchup-y. 
Delectable! 😋 This may be where you want to go for affordable #foiegras fix with $9 per serving. \n
Medium was the doneness recommended and it turned out just fine. Though not a conventional #zichar dish, this is a must order @ubinseafood ! Priced at $12/100gms, i consider it a steal for the sinful yet delicious steak. \n
1) 10 sticks of Pork OR Chicken Satay\n<br />2) 125 gms of Smoked Pork Collar or Smoked Duck Breast \n<br />3) NZ Lamb Ribs OR Kurobuta Ribs

salted egg yolk sauce with bits of salted egg over steamed sotong
And we ordered them all in 3 different styles. My parents felt that despite the large number of garlic cloves surrounding the crab parts, the taste was actually a bit lacking. The chilli crab was exceeded my expectations, the sauce was thick, sweet and spicy and you can see that they added a lot of eggs to the mix. My mum commented that they might\'ve been a bit heavy handed on the starch though. Mantous were crispy, dense but surprisingly soft. The salted egg crab was the favourite with loads of the golden buttery yolk enveloping the crab. The regular-sized Sri Lankan crabs were meaty and fresh, each priced at $38 before GST so it\'s $76 for 3 crabs under the promo 😊
Expect a no-frills and unpretentious platter of juicy Angus steak at this zi char place, complete with wedges, caramelised onions and beef fried rice (rice fried in beef fat). Seasoned with just salt and pepper, this is perfectly cooked to mouth-watering succulence and perfection – what’s not to love? At $12 per 100g, it\'s not hard to see why this is a must-order when you head to New Ubin Seafood. 
Small portion @$10 could easily feed 4 or more!! These were the chunkiest, paste-like yam paste I ever had!!! It was very good and satisfying though mixed with the coconut milk 😋
A feast on eat with your family day #throwback! They had a buy 2 get 1 free promotion for crabs which was quite worth it!!! Chilli and black pepper crab were good, crab meat wasn\'t very tender but the sauce made up for it! Their signature steak was decent too with the fried rice tasting like 萨博饭(claypot rice) with maggi seasoning 
$9 for 2 small pieces of foie gras (wasn\'t enough) and a slow cooked runny egg 
The Zi char restaurant is New Ubin Seafood, with some outstanding dishes.
This is super fragrant! I\'m a garlic lover! I was just munching on the garlic!!! *rawrs*
Tender and juicy angus steak cubes with fries and caramelized onions, served with beef fat fried rice. Perfect Sunday dinner :)
Warm chocolate lava cake served in a ramekin with a separate bowl of vanilla ice cream. Just good enough to satisfy your craving for dessert.
With the $38/crab and buy 2 get 1 free promotion, it\'s a steal, but! Oh my...was it because we went on a friday night? The crab had a strong burnt taste and crab flesh was quite soft in texture, not firm. I guess quality doesn\'t come with low price tag for this case.
With the $38/crab and buy 2 get 1 free promotion, it\'s a steal, but! Crab flesh was quite soft in texture, not firm. As comparing to the other two methods of cooking for our other crabs here, i guess we should be glad we finally got one crab more palatable. 
It was a lot of sugar used, good first spoonful of cereals but subsequently you\'ll feel like you\'re just biting on sugar...lots of it. Prawns were fresh and fried cripsy, but not oily.

The crab had a strong burnt taste and crab flesh was quite soft in texture, not firm. I understand it\'s salted egg crab not salted crab but i guess the chef might have forgotten he added salt already and did it again. I guess quality doesn\'t come with low price tag for this case.
The oysters used are quite plump and fresh! Hmm other than that there\'s really nothing to rave about.
Not the best steak ever at that price range but still tasty, especially with their beef fat fried rice. Do call them in advance if you plan on coming down because they\'re insanely popular! Heard them turn down more than 10 walk-in groups during the span of our dinner
Medium rare beef at a tze char place, I think is pretty awesome! 
Thick noodle soup with crab. I like the ideal you can opt out milk. 
this restaurant serves up American charred ribs as well as angus steak. \n<br />tried this yet?
The one which requires you to go all bloodlust vampire and bite, suck and slurp all the raw goodness of the prawn head. Yowzers. 4.25/5
But they are more well known for their steak platter haha.
Went exploring for dinner today. The steak was really awesome. Done nice and medium rare, and succulent... Really atas zi char... Quite ex but we did enjoy it
Foie Gras in a zi char restaurant .. Who wld have thought. $9 for a cup with a good sized portion of foie gras... And it wuz goooooood..
It was a little dry, probably due to lack of fats. But the crackling was 😍😍😍.
Equally satisfying seafood &amp; meat!!! This place is super popular so book early to score a seat here :) | ★★★★★
I\'m still devastated I didn\'t take photos of three dishes - the boss-style bee hoon, pork knuckle, and HK kailan special. In summary, we had 14 dishes, 9 bottles of booze, and one birthday cake...for the six of us in three hours. I say yay!
The smoked pork collar earlier was cubed for this dish alongside crunchy prawn bits. We ordered a noodle dish, boss-style bee hoon but I forgot to take a photo of it even though we ordered another portion after we finished the first. It was that good. Wok hei was amazing, and adding cili padi to it was ingenious.
So good, so addictive. The smokiness was not off-putting, it blended well with the molasses-tinged glaze. Like the satay earlier, this one had the right balance of meat and fat too. Because the collar was used, it was very tender.
This was good, but not extraordinary. The garlic cloves that came with it were good as snacks.
This was gone in less than five minutes...right after this photo was taken.
These hand-cut lovelies were fried in beef fat...so much flavour.
At 80 cents per piece, they sure don\'t come cheap but the meat used is of better quality. Juicy and tender, perfect balance of meat and fat, but they could use a little char.
Love the fact that the stalks of the leaves were not over-cooked and limp. Great with rice.
Part 2
Signature dish!
Prawn rolls
Highly recommended!
medium portion but a bit too huge a portion isn\'t it?
Cutting them into small bites and fried till caramelization. Stir frying the rice with caramelized bites and seasoned with dark soy sauce and salt. So buttery. So savory. So fragrant.

BUT nothing could compare with this. How good could Garlic and Crab be??? Very fresh crab with thin shell. There was no immediate strong garlicky taste. Just the sweet crab meat with the deep savory sweetness from the garlic. But the magic began when I bite into the soft and fluffy garlic. I could tasted \"crab\" in the garlic. \n<br />I believed the chef deep fried the garlic before baking them with the crabs. While they were in the oven, the juice from the crab flowed out and the garlic soaked it up like a sponge. Honestly, I loved the garlic more than the crab. 😅😅😅 New Ubin Seafood. \n<br />Block 27 Sin Ming Road (behind Block 26), #01-174\n<br />Sin Ming Industrial Estate Sector A, Singapore 575680\n<br />Phone: 6466 9558\n<br />Operating Hours\n<br />Mon – Fri: 11am – 2pm, 5.30pm – 10.30pm (Last Order)\n<br />Sat &amp; Sun: 11.30am – 2.30pm, 5.30pm – 10.30pm (Last Order)

A seafood place that does so much better in other areas (i.e Meats).
This place may be named \"Ubin Seafood\" but don\'t ever leave without ordering the steak! Chunky, tender cubes of beef seasoned with coarse bits of salt and pepper. Unpretentious and just so good. This is served with a separate course of fried rice greased with the fats from the very steak.
I\'ve not had black fried bee hoon that often, this one is a little greasy but packed with lots of \"wok hei\" (charred flavour), makes you go \"oooh\" on first mouthful. Best shared with a couple of friends, so it doesn\'t get too heavy ;)
Simply because we were too hungry, and the stir-fries here have good \"wok hei\"! The fried prawn dumplings, black fried bee hoon and beef steak are recommended. Happy company, happy meal.
Dinner gathering with former colleagues! Happy yummy Friday and a great start to the weekend! Yay!!
Poached HK Kai Lan topped with deep fried of its own shredded bits. Small portion at S$12. We found it bland in taste.  A tad costlier than usual Cze Char vegetables dishes.
Decent steak at S$12 per 100 gram (min. 500 gram). Set comes with sides of wedge potatoes and beef fat fried rice. It\'s good.                                             Very busy place, must make reservations. Good service by Philippines boys and there\'s no service charge. Highly recommended.
Yummy yummy. This is a saucier version. It\'s moist and tasty. The squid is fresh with a soft crunch. Love it. Small portion at S$14.
Not only do they serve standard zi char items, New Ubin also dabbles in Angus steak and German pork trotters. The famous steak (reasonable at $10 per 100g) comes with potato wedges, caramalized onions and amazing, heart-stopping fried rice cooked in the beef fat. Their standout zi char dishes include the Salted Egg Squid, Har Cheong Gai, and of course, crab!
Best steak in a coffee shop that you can possibly get | ★★★★☆
Something very different at a zhi char stall.
Perfect texture, atas zhi char!
Summary of tonight\'s #ons #gathering! Hope to have more of it soon! 🍴🐚🐟🐮
Finally tried the highly raved about New Ubin Seafood! ✌️ Loved every bit of this western-fusion meal. Will be back for their crabs! 😁
Very yummy. There are shredded beef on the top of the rice 
Accompaniment to the Certified Chilled U.S. Angus Rib-eye Steak
Broiled to perfection and served with Idaho potato wedges, caramelised onions and beef-dripping fried rice
Shiokness
This dish is too overrated I don\'t know understand why it is on every other table. It just feels something is lacking in the marination. Or the quality is not consistent with crowds.
My new favorite tze char place! More details on gninethree.com
This Black Pepper Crab is da bomb! 💣 They are now having a 2+1 crab promotion right now so we had 3 crabs for $72! What a steal! ☺
Black Angus US Beef. Such an unlikely offering at a tze char place but SHIOK! 👍
Butter Cream Crab! And a Salted Egg Yolk Crab at the background (obviously almost finished) 😅
I know beef at a seafood place sounds misplaced, but this was sooo good!
The steak here is always done to perfection consistently. The pinkness in the middle always an affirmation that the steak has been treated with respect. This is a must order when you come here. . . . .
The tobiko is a deviant choice from the usual ikura, and provided some brininess and texture in the otherwise creamy texture of the sous vide egg and uni. #uni #tobiko #egg #newubinseafood #food #foodporn #foodie #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgfoodporn #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodporn #burpple #burpplesg #whati8today #igsg #sgig
So we were planning to head over to New Ubin Seafood in the night, for dinner.  It became our lunch date instead 🤣You know how crowded weekend dinners can be and how long the queue can be. We have decided to take the chance and hit it early. We are not the usual, romantic candlelit dinner couple.

😋\n<br />.\n<br />This Babi Pongteh is good in the general Zhi Char standard. But think twice if you are considering bringing a true blue Peranakan or your Bibi/Chor Chor here.

US Black Angus Ribeye Steak is a must and their fried rice cooked with beef fats. This time we tried squid steamed in soya sauce that\'s cooked perfectly.

The thin slices were evenly caramelised with a hint of spicy kick and savoury burn. Yes, it lacked the salty meat juice I was dreaming of, but an interesting rendition after all.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #hawkersg #food #chinese #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat

Won\'t recommend getting this dish. It was subpar compared to all their other good dishes from new ubin. The mussels were a bit too small and the flavour of the sauce did not soak in. Bread was given to dip in the sauce but it was meh ⭐️ 2.5/5 ⭐️
IS. FREAKING. AWESOME. THIS. IS. BEEF. NOT. PORK. @junkieong \'s recommendations are never wrong. Loved the food, service and ambience here. We were dining amidst lush greenery as it\'s uniquely located at the 6th level of an industrial building. Its atmosphere reminded me of Jiufen in Taiwan 😌\n<br />•\n<br /> @burpple #burpple #hungrygowhere @hungrygowhere #newubinseafood @newubinseafood #beef #steak #zichar #zicharsg #whati8today

Chicken &amp; mutton satay (85 cents each) \n<br />Yum yum in my tum~\n<br />⭐️ 4/5 ⭐️
Cheaper and gives off a stronger beef taste to it
It brings out the sweetness of the vegetable
The broth is so rich and sweet from the seafood they added in. 👍4/5 ✔️Going back for this

pork ribs b\'cos they tasted so good with a smokey BBQ sauce on those juicy meat that would fall of the bone easily. Be warned that these ribs were so finger-licking good once they got you started you wouldn\'t wanna stop. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #bbq #porkribs #burpproved #newubin
This meat platter of theirs would be the ultimate for any carnivore. We chose the pork satay, pork collar and their lamb ribs this time. \n<br />Everything was the satay was just good, from the juicy meat to the tasty sauce. The pork collars had an intense smokiness and tasted amazing. Lastly, anyone would fall in love with those lamb ribs, including those who wouldn\'t normally like lamb. There wasn\'t any slightest awful gamy taste to it but instead; it was succulent, perfectly cooked and just fabulous. \n<br />Alternative include chicken satay, duck breast meat and Kurobuta pork ribs, but we just loved what we chose tonight. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #lambribs #satay #porkcollar #burpproved #newubin

Of the many flavours available, we loved this baked garlic crab the most for its intense garlicky taste. \n<br />Of cos there were others, such as their Wagyu steak (with that awesome fried rice), succulent rack of ribs, prawn paste chicken, white wine mussels, and their must-have Hokkien prawn noodles. \n<br />With all their good food, we know for sure the new location at Hillview won\'t discourage us from going again. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #crabs #burpproved #newubin

Since i didn\'t feel jelat after stuffing myself (indication of the good oil control at new ubin), as a teochew, I had to try the orhnee. Admittedly it\'s not exactly an insta-worthy shot but for the sake of completeness. The orh nee ($10 small, feeds 3-4) was neither oily nor overly sweet, just pure yam-my goodness. Traditionally it is not uncommon to see a layer of oil over the paste. So good for the sort-of-yet-not-really health conscious. (Like me!) Comes with unsweetened coconut milk to self pour.
Wanted to try this nonya-style cooking but weren\'t keen on the fish roe option. The brinjal was really surprising. It\'s crispy and caramelised. Kinda reminded me of those fried anchovy snacks. \n<br />#zichar #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgrestaurant #burpple
Ordered the popular Angus steak (500-700g, $13/100g). Comes with wedges and rice fried with the beef fat. This was medium, might go for medium rare next time. Truth be told it wasn\'t the most memorable dish of the night but no complaints la. Next time will try more seafood.
Liked their cooking style which is easy on the oil. Also free lime juice (for a Facebook like), atas Edamame and towelettes? No corkage charge policy? They just earned a new loyal auntie fan :D\n<br />#newubinseafood\n<br />#zichar #sgfood #sgrestaurant #singaporeanfood #burpple

Love love love the slightly chao-tar taste (wok hei?)!
$7 per stick, minimum 2 sticks for each order. 
You can actually taste the grainy bits of salted egg which went well with the steamed squid (sotong).

Medium beef steak!
When i asked what were the differences of the three oysters in the menu, the waiter\'s response was absolutely classic. I am sure the boss wouldn\'t like to hear this, but the waiter said, \"they are all the same, taste the same and basically the same. The only difference is the price (which were $3, $4 and $6 each respectively)\". Shocking. 
Oily, really.
Crispy, juicy but a little too salty. 
It\'s $16.50 per prawn! 😱😱😨😨 luckily I ate quite a lot of it hahahaha \n<br />#vscocam #burpple #ilovesashimi #onthetable #whatdiet #eatfirstregretlater #latergram #onthetable #omnomnom #explodingsiyi

I downed three bowls at a go! What is heart attack? 😂😂
The sauce was very flavourful and not just one dimensional like most black pepper sauce would be. It balanced really well with the sweetness of the crab.
We thought it lacked curry leaves and cili padi which would have made it so much more enjoyable.
Hei chor! OMFG! Hei chor!
Don\'t worry, we didn\'t ask for the chilli sauce. It came with it...possibly because the crime has become so common that they succumbed to its illegality.
Our #favourite dish, crazily delicious! I shall let the picture speak for itself!Have a good #dinner! @ubinseafood
Mmm. Pretty good value at $7 per stick.
