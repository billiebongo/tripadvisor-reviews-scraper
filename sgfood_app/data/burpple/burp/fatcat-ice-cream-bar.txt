Colour me festive, thats what I felt when i sank my mouth into this seasonal special at Fatcat. 
How about getting this at $68.90 from @fatcatsg 😋
$4.50 for a scoop of tasteful earl grey Lavender ice cream. Very high quality ice cream from a quaint neighbourhood joint. Will be back for the other desserts
👯🍦 The week I travelled to the city four days in a row - twice for @fatcatsg\'s Salted Yolk ice-cream which we decorated on our own with popcorn, fairy floss and edible flowers! 🌸
Starting the week right ✌🏻️💕 with awesome Salted Egg Yolk 🐣 Ice Cream Waffles🍦, made even yummier with company from the sweets!😘❤️
But it\'s at their pop up booth! And it\'s free SALTED EGG ice cream! Salted egg! With dry ice for ultimate dramatic effect and weird toppings galore 😍😍😍. It tasted like the real salted egg yolk but isn\'t overkill at all! What magic is this. I really like it. Giannnnnn.
Thanks to Frosted Flair at Mandarin Galley, I managed to taste the salted egg yolk ice cream by FatCat. It was light and was not \'jalek\' for me, which made me craving for more. I loved the edible flowers, fruits and lavender toppings.
Charcoal Waffles with a single scoop of their amazing flavoured ice creams! Both black sesame and thai milk tea were lovely with the charcoal waffles and the caramel sauce and they melt at the perfect speed for my slow eating self HAHA A bit difficult to find since it was in a bit of an obscure location but definitely worth it! Definitely would try the butterbeer one next time!
We all appreciate a good weekend after a hard week at work. How about starting your weekend brunch with fatcat?
Yup, Sorbet! You\'ve probably tried strawberry or lemon, but banana?
This bowl is loaded with salmon sashimi, watermelon, avocado, grapefruit and topped with a glorious 62°C egg. A rather comforting rice bowl.
Get yours now at @fatcatsg 😂
Charcoal and butter waffles with so many special flavors of ice cream to choose from! The texture of the waffles were comparatively crispy. Love the salted caramel sauce that surrounding the waffles. We tried the earl grey lavender ice cream (cant taste earl grey thou) and milk tea ice cream. Will go back for different flavour. \n<br />Waffles: about $6. Ice cream: about $4.50/scoop
For crispy charcoal waffles and salted egg yolk sauce. The sauce actually comes in a separate small cup for you to drizzle over your waffles and ice cream. Pretty decent selection of ice cream flavors. 
This deconstructed papaya salad was a delight! At $18 it seemed a bit pricy, but came with two Bon bons in covered in curry powder and filled with a tangy liquid Centre. The salad itself, Som Tum, starts with a little quenelle of beer sorbet a top a crumble of powdered peanuts and coconut-tinged powder. Cubes of pickled mango accompany strands of papaya and candied wafers of fruit that simply melt in your mouth. 
Charcoal waffle with salted egg yolk sauce on top with watermelon and Thai milk tea ice cream ($15.00 +$1.00 salted egg yolk sauce ),I like their waffle but their ice cream is too sweet for me .overall rating :3.5/5 
Pistachio &amp; Butterscotch Ice Cream atop a Charcoal Waffle drizzled with Salted Egg Yolk sauce 💕
Finally re-visiting this place after a year and a half. My first visit was really meh, with both the waffles and ice cream falling way below expectations. This time though, the waffle was on point, and so were the ice cream flavours. 
Charcoal Waffles with Salted Egg Yolk sauce, topped with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream [S$6 for charcoal waffles, S$1 for salted egg yolk and S$3.90 for Vanilla bean ice cream] at Fatcat Ice Cream Bar, Bedok.
These little balz of guava bonbons came as a surprise, it boomz in your mouth. Lol. 😅
The ginger lends a fragrant undertone to this rice wine bubble!
Fancy name aside, I couldn\'t really detect the taste of salted egg in this. But it\'s still a decent charcoal cake, moist and fluffy, especially love the luscious chocolate glaze!
A play of textures, between the soft orange shell, the youghurt, and the various crunch, granita and candied fruits. \n<br />The Orange flavors bring a certain freshness with a fruity soju punch. The feel of the tropics without the heat. \n<br />A great play of the famous Cassie\'s plum at a fraction of the cost. Definitely worth a try. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #fatcatsg
Finally gotten a chance to indulge at one of my fav dessert place @fatcatsg after a long time despite my past hectic work schedule the last few months ever since i returned from Taiwan.\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />Fei Mao\'s charcoal waffle with double goodness of pistachio and butterscotch alongside. And salted egg sauce is always killin it 🗡
Delivered on a wooden platter covered in smoke the mysterious dish quietly wafted onto out table. \n<br />The bonbon\'s were just thick enough to give a good crunch before it exploded in Monster\'s mouth in a moment of sudden joy and ecstasy. \n<br />Ok drama much. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #fatcatsg
Butterbeer icecream, salted egg sauce on Charcoal waffle; lightly sprinkled with lavendar\n<br />Verdict: can do without the salted egg sauce, as the salted caramel at the sides are sufficient, and if light airy crispy waffles are your thing. Also, it\'s quite expensive for a piece of waffle
The first bite was unnerving, there was an explosion of flavors happening in my mouth that was totally unexpected.\n<br />The 2 separate flavors weren\'t fighting to gain attention. They have somehow merged into 1 super intense flavor, like there was a head banging rave party, happening inside my mouth. \n<br />Such a dainty little thing, hiding such fly flavors. \n<br />For $6 a pop it isn\'t exactly value for money but definitely worth a shot. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #fatcatsg
Oh don\'t have to envy me 😛 a cup of hot coffee would do the trick too.
It was so so, nothing special. Not worth coming back for the second time. 
This brick of banana cake is moist &amp; rich in flavour, topped with vanilla ice cream, lemon curd, smoked butter and black sugar👍🏼
Thursdays and Fridays are the happiest🙈 Toasting you a shot of [Purple S$15/jug] which is of a nice purplish blue with a squirt of lime juice. It\'s pretty strong for me, still prefer the plated desserts 🙊
You guys have definitely heard of their lime mojito spheres, now they have blood spheres which consists of red wine sangria and orange. Be sure not to miss it!
Pop it into your mouth and I bet you will be wowed by it! \n<br />This was served as a pre dessert of Orange Soju which is available in @fatcatsg Korean month menu.
Featuring here is the Blood Spheres at $4.50  for one, contain a burst of flavours with red wine sangria and orange. 🍷
It\'s very hot these days so we have desserts for lunch. It\'s the hottest season for Korean drama (you know la 😛), so it\'s Korean month at Fat Cat!
Charcoal waffles with salted egg yolk sauce topped with beer butter 🍺and smoked chocolate ice cream🍦🍫!
.\n<br />Ignite your passion with coconut, mint and... curry powder ?!\n<br />.\n<br />Laying my hands on @fatcatsg seasonal plated dessert before they phase out to pave way for new ones coming week!
Won\'t you wanna pop these sphere made with red wine into your mouth and let it explode?
😍
$15. The waffles were one of the best I\'ve had, and I enjoyed the Thai green tea and espresso ice cream flavors we had. The espresso in particular tempered the sweetness of the dish. The salted egg yolk sauce wasn\'t spectacular though, I wouldn\'t order that again. 
[$10.90] Located in a quiet neighborhood, this cafe is a really good place for a chilling saturdate and it\'s so easy to find. The waffle is crispy and the ice creams are not bad too! With the ice cream topped with the sauce, it just melts nicely in your mouth and fits perfectly with the waffle!! 👍😋
The waffle was very crispy, it ain\'t like the normal waffles that\'s actually moist on the inside though. Love the sauce (what\'s not to love about salted egg yolk?!) but paired this with the wrong choice of ice cream and that made the taste of the whole dish kinda off. Nevertheless it was still good. Will be back for more! 
After reading so many good reviews on this cafe, my colleagues and i decided to go down and try it. The ice cream and waffles are really nice. Salted Egg Sauce has that \"画龙点金“ effect! 👍🏻
Fluffy plain waffle drizzled wth chocolate sauce, plated with salted caramel sauce on the side and sprinkled with dried lavender flowers. S$5.50. Worth it. 
More salted egg goodness! 😍 charcoal waffles with vanilla + smoked chocolate + butter beer ice cream topped with salted egg sauce! Yummy!

Charcoal Choux [$5]\n<br />Mandarin Chocolate [$7]
Meet Mr. Black Waffle Charming, the charcoal waffle from Fatcat Ice Cream Bar. A very charismatic waffle that fits the bill exactly as my perfect waffle. Slightly crunchy and airy. Not too soft, not too crunchy. Not chewy. Paired with the sea salt matcha ice cream and salted caramel sauce that is not overly sweet, I was very satisfied. The sea salt matcha ice cream here is a must try. Most matcha ice creams are either too bitter or too sweet. This one is just perfect, probably because of the sea salt magic. Other flavours I tried were pistachio, smoked oolong and black sesame. All these were a little too sweet for me though. I also added SGD 1 for the salted egg sauce (not featured). The salted egg sauce was mild and not jelat. Nice to have but not a must. 
Finally tried the highly-acclaimed Gourmet Charcoal Waffles with Salted Egg Yolk and a scoop of Butterbeer Ice Cream (S$6 for charcoal waffles, S$1 for salted egg yolk and S$4.50 for Butterbeer ice cream cos it\'s premium flavour). Yum. Cat and I agreed that this combination tastes great!
When fat cats meet Fatcat after dinner, they get satiated with themed plated desserts. The Faux Passionfruit (S$18) is a 2-in-1 plated dessert combo with a Pre and a Main. The Main impressed us with the attention to detail in terms of plating and flavour-pairing creativity - it looks almost too pretty to eat! And the passionfruit flavour bursts are so amazing that we fell in love with the dessert.
Perfect combination of charcoal waffle, salted egg sauce and beer butter ice cream!
Their pistachio ice cream is to die for! I\'ve never been so addicted to ice cream until I tried this. Be sure to also pair the ice cream with their charcoal waffle. Overall, a simple cafe with reasonably priced yummy desserts. Moscato is available too! 
Seems like FatCat\'s a regular fixture on this list, but it\'s deservedly so.\n<br />This budget plated dessert features crumble-studded banana caramel ice-cream, sitting on a chocolate sandwich cookie base, and wrapped up in a golden-brown torched marshmallow. It\'s wonderfully nutty, sweet and gooey, comes with a side chick of a caramel tuile, and best of all, paid for with a single $10 note.
Lime Mojito Sphere.
While I fully concur with early adopters on their sentiments about the creativity and quality of their desserts, it was their excellent service that impressed even more. Their attentive, sincere, and eager-to-serve qualities were consistent, even when the place was packed to the gills and everyone was so busy.
If Ariana Grande was a dessert, she would be FATCAT\'s Faux Passionfruit - pastel sweet on the outside, fiery and sassy on the inside (the popping sensation of passionfruit and curry - yes curry - on my tongue was simply indescribable!). This fine dame is preceded by a pair of bon bons which arrive at your table in the most dramatic way - complete with dry ice smoke flowing over your table. Hard to believe this is a product found in a humble neighbourhood cafe! 
Rudolph the red nose reindeer, has a very shiny nose. Ain\'t this pretty cake shiny too? Red glazed dome decorated with snowflakes and also edible gold. Earl grey mousse, lemon cream and chestnut inside this yummy cake.
Thinking what cake to get for your Christmas party? How about trying something different this year? You can get this from @fatcatsg !😍 Just imagine a rich earl grey mousse cake with a hidden lemon cream in the center😱
it is small sphere contain alcohol. There are different type of mojito they serve daily. When i was there last wk i order the Green Tea &amp; Lime Flavour. The Mojito simply burst &amp; melt into my mouth. Alot of ppl say that this 1 mouth cost u $4.50 srsly they will feel the pain. It is worth Experience to try it. Once u try it u will get addicted to it.
Try something different this year, try @fatcatsg
Why not try @fatcatsg\'s Christmas Cake Collection?\n<br />Introducing the Strawberry Shortcake [$45] nett.\n<br />Japanese fluffy sponge cake covered with french chantilly creme and topped with fresh strawberries. I can never resist and say no to Strawberry shortcake.
Visit @fatcatsg and you will. Their lovely dessert and ice cream will put a smile on your face.
Found my new love at Neighbourhood. The salted egg sauce a lil disappointing but the matcha will be good compliment for the waffle and lavender bites. 
Now due to the high demand, you have to add another $1 just for Salted Egg Yolk sauce. You can also choose to have a scoop or two ice cream like we did. We went for Earl Grey Lavender and Butter Beer which is $4.50 for each as they fall under Premium flavours. I personally prefer the latter which has a malty alcoholic taste, but will I travel all the way to East for it again? Maybe not, I\'ll probably just stick to Wimbly Lu\'s waffles
Really it is their creativity of their Ice Cream. When u there just to enjoy their ice cream &amp; waffles. It just give u many choices of ice cream u can choose. Guess the owner has a creativity mind of creating different type ice cream frm Alcholic &amp; Non-Alcholic. All the Ice cream tasted good. Usually i will order the Beer Butter Ice Cream &amp; Thai MilkTea it simply taste shiok &amp; awesome. Best Serve is with their Charcoal Waffles &amp; their salted egg yolk Sauce. To Prevent Disappointment pls come early &amp; get their charcoal waffles. Limited Stock for the Charcoal Waffles.
Worry not, the world can wait. Take your time and recuperate.\"\n<br />Never underestimate the power of desserts to make you feel better! Missing this rose scent from FatCat\'s Chocolat Jardin (pre desert).
Yay! How great can that be?! Check out their instagram page for more information.
And thats saying something given the sheer number of waffles I consumed to date.\n<br />_\n<br />@jerroldpwg and I had a hard time wondering why the picture wasnt centred. Turns out that the waffle wasnt even in the centre of the plate. Our OCD eyes. 😧\n<br />_\n<br />#thefoodjournalist

delicious. Toasted marshmallow around banana caramel ice cream. The ice cream was so on point and the chocolate at the bottom complimented the dish perfectly (coming from someone who doesn\'t eat chocolate). Overall great visit yet again!
🦄
Pop one in and you\'ll feel the burst of lime juice and rum sliding down your throat. You can even taste the sea salt and osmanthus flower. Devilish good, but a trifle too expensive.
Charcoal waffle with earl grey lavender ice cream was on point 😋 drizzled with salted egg yolk sauce, though we weren\'t a big fan of the contrast in savory and sweet ⭐️⭐️⭐️
An elegant looking plated dessert from FATCAT but it comes with a cost. At $18, it\'s not the cheapest dessert that you can find in a neighborhood cafe. The Chocolat Jardin is constructed to replicate a mini garden, made up of edible elements. A unique experience eating an edible garden but my wallet hurts.
There\'s always space of desserts, especially if they are from @fatcatsg!
A delightful bite of lime juice, rum, lemon peel, lime zest, and edible herbs!
This new plated dessert from the hottest dessert cafe of the moment is whimsical and creative.
when you see it - that whiff of cold air. charcoal waffles at fatcat is lauded as gourmet waffles with accompanying salted egg sauce by the side. charcoal waffles came extra airy and ashy which was nice but when you have ice cream and drizzled caramel bed, i think the sauce is an overkill or if not, really not necessary. doesnt it ruin the taste of your ice cream too? imho. that said, the oolong and butter beer ice cream was really legit, as real as it gets. and please, you have to try the mojito spheres, totally wicked.
legend has it that in the far east, in the old ways of bedoky, behind the altar at the temple of fatcat, lies spheres of magical mojito potion. before the very naked eyes of mere mortals, lust and envy consumes them all. spellbound and bewitched, one inevitably puts a benign gobule into their mouth. instantaneously, the benign sphere alters into liquid and a tsunami of involuntarily state of happiness and joy ensue as it rushes down your throat and into your bloodstream. eyes shut, eyes wide, convulsions, nirvana, there is no healing like this oral eroticism before. ever. this is the far west and i call out to any dwellers, near and afar who have yet to make this pilgrimage. go forth today, seek and thou monday shall be blessed and healed. hail mojito!
#FatCatSg hit the spot again!! Love the curry crumbles the most! 😍 Food tastes even better when you enjoy it with good frens 👫👬👭.\n<br />But patience is required if you patronize Fat Cat.. Min. 30mins Q outside the cafe &amp; at least another 30mins wait for your food to be served on weekends.
[$4.50] for each sphere. The exploding feeling you get when it pops in your mouth.
Reverse smores $10, caramelised banana ice cream with a cookie base within. 😍 Reminds me of a Mooncake but this is coated with torched marshmallow instead. Interesting twist.
Visited this little shop house amidst exam preparations to have a little taste of their new menu! Their plated desserts look (and sound) really appetising so despite them being known for their ice cream I had to give this a go (S$16). Service was really good as the chef came to introduce the dish as it was served (it was rather empty at that time). Absolutely loved the dish and loved the kick from the curry soil buried underneath. The sorbet and ice cream were so good that my sis and I ordered a separate cup after finishing this :) Definitely a must try but do go down early as it gets crowded at around 12.30pm on Sat! Look out for their weekly featured plated dishes too :D
Have you tried any of them? \n<br />In frame, Lychee Martini ($16) which is totally mind blowing with that bubbling popping effect inside your brain after eating it. I tot it was rather innovative and intriguing.\n<br />More pictures and details will be up on blog when I wake up tomorrow. Good night peeps.\n<br />Thank you @sophiensyy and @fatcatsg for the media invite.
Put the whole sphere into your mouth and gently press it and feel the explosion in your mouth. A mouthful of lime juice and rum, garnished with lime zest, lemon peel and edible herbs.
This pretty deconstructed dessert is part of their 3 course Kyoho Grapes plated dessert. \n<br />Comprising of grape tartare, peeled grapes, shiso leaf and grapefruit sorbet. Loving the grapefruit sorbet~refreshing with delicate citrusy flavour. Oh and did I not mention that that whip was amazing too.. Available from 30 sept onwards
It\'s will be the best thing you have ever eaten. @fatcatsg is gonna relaunch their menu with new items. Available from 30th September onwards. You know where to head to. 😏
Managed to grab a seats despite of the crowd and long queue. We order
[KYOHO DREAMS | $18] is one plated dessert that serves a pre, main and post dishes. What I have here is the main dish, consisting of grape tartare, fresh and Korean peeled with shiso, lime and salt. Alongside with grapefruit campari sorbet.
[Kyoho Dreams S$18] - comes with pre, main &amp; post dessert. \n<br />➊ Pre: Wine Grape Spheres \n<br />➋ Main: Grape Tartare, fresh &amp; Korean peeled with Shiso, Lime and Grapefruit Sorbet. Pretty &amp; dainty 😍😍 ➌ Post: Tom Yum Granita with kaffir lime thread and grated ginger.
Torched marshmallows, filled with banana ice cream inside. Soft marshmallow that sits on top of a cookie. Definitely one of my favourite dish today. \n<br />Thanks @feimaocharles, @sophiensyy for the invite and @fatcatsg\'s team.
So pretty, I thought I saw myself in this dish! Eh kidding. Haha! Glad to see everyone today and thank you @dianaaatan and @randylim27 for saving my life hehe! And of course, @sophiensyy for the invite, and for letting my eyes feast on the dessert and 😏. HAHA!
In frame is their spheres, a choice of lime mojito or green tea baileys 🍵 #fatcatsgh
They will be relaunching their new menu. Check them out for their yummy sweet treats. Featuring one of my favourite - Lychee Martini 😍😍😍

The first thought that came to my mind was ice-cream for the kids in the neighborhood! Then, it came to me that we are raising the bar for heartland food and prices (our standard of living IS increasing; don\'t blame the gov that SG becomes the most expensive city in the world!). We\'d some issues with their queue system, because we must be seated before we can order waffles; and it was so difficult to find a table for 5 pax! Anyway, we waited for an hour before we get our hands on this Charcoal Waffle with salted egg sauce topped with butter beer and banana caramel ice-cream! Plating is beautiful. To me, there was a bitter aftertaste for the charcoal waffle. While the ice-creams serves to neutralize the bitterness, both flavours seem to be the better ones we\'ve tried at the counter. Overall, the ice-creams need a little taste refining, and the management should seriously consider renting space outside, mange the queue, and having heartland promotions (during off peak hours for example) -- running a business isn\'t as easy as you think.
It literally melts away the moment it\'s eaten. It\'s a refreshing burst of flavours, which I am truly impressed! This is what I call - Gourmet dessert at pocket-friendly pricing! \n<br />One point to note, these are only made in limited quantities daily, and I was lucky there\'s still 3 pieces available for that day.
I am quite surprised this works for us as we both are not fans of salted egg yolk based desserts. \n<br />The savoury salted egg yolk sauce, with the lavender infused waffles, and my alcoholic ice-cream makes for a killer combination!
We topped up with salted egg yolk sauce (S$1), and added on butter beer ice-cream (S$4.50) and cookies-n-cream ice-cream (S$3.90). Visually-appealing aside, it\'s tasty too! Enclosed with generous swirls of salted caramel sauce, the charcoal waffles boasts a subtle hint of lavender. \n<br />I chose their butter beer ice-cream, which is malty with a light alcoholic aftertaste. Tasted really good with the waffles!
But the bojio-level is way too high!😔 My quarantine is finally coming to an end &amp; I am feeling so much better already!💪🏻 Gonna be back in the soccer field tomorrow too!😊\n<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖\n<br />📷: @karlnch \n<br />Hashtag sgfoodiary to share your daily eats with our food community and get a chance to be featured!😉\n<br />➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
Here featuring the 3 flavors that we had: Jade Magnum - sea salt matcha (back), Violet Magnum - Champagne rose (middle) and Fatcat Magnum - Salted Egg (front). They are so pretty right?! Anyway we both agreed that the Violet Magnum stood out the most among the 3. Taking a bite, we was met with a delicious champagne flavour, with the addition of rose water that adds a distinctive, subtle flavor to the ice cream, lastly with the chocolate coating topped everything off nicely. Do drop by at Fat Cat to check them out! Happy TGIF!

FATCAT for my second time which I was dragged by a friend and I was so reluctant in the first place because of their TERRIBLE services during my first visit. But the second visit was great, especially served by that particular girl (don\'t know her name but she has a medium height and long hair with no make up on, typical girl). So the $3.90 scoop of the banana caramel is worthy this time! Haha! Thumbs up! 
Ordered a fusion of charcoal waffle with and add on of chinese salted egg yolk sauce.  The sauce was something new, an interesting combination with the giant caramel swirls. The ice creams were up to standard and there are interesting options like earl grey and lavender available for the ambitious tastebuds. 
Shared the Charcoal Waffle with two scoops of ice cream among my friends. The Pistachio flavour is smooth and creamy, tastes great with the waffles; while the Watermelon Soju is refreshing, though better off by itself. Will go back to try more flavours of ice cream. :D
Fatcat\'s famous Charcoal Waffle with Salted Egg Yolk sauce. I wouldn\'t order the Salted Egg Yolk sauce again - not that it wasn\'t delicious (it was), but it comes as an add-on on top of the existing Salted Caramel sauce (you can see it on the side), which on its own is enough &amp; pretty darn good already.
One of the best waffles I ate. It\'s not the fluffy kind but rather the crispy type. Wanted to get the watermelon soju but it was insufficient for a scoop. Thus we had earl grey lavender (definitely recommend and best!) and butter beer. Added on the salted egg yolk sauce! Perfect match for the waffle! This is going to be my comfort food. Most importantly it\'s near to home! Worth the try! Hidden gem in the eastern neighbourhood.
I miss going to @fatcatsg
To finish, FatCat offers the aptly-named \"Magnum Pop\", a tasty house-made Magnum consisting of strawberry sorbet encased in white chocolate crunch &amp; popping candy.
This newly-launched menu item first kickstarts decently with refreshing watermelon popsicles topped with rose foam.
THE BUTTER BEER ICECREAM IS SO GOOODDD! the taste of beer lingers in your mouth as though you really drank beer~ the waffles were soft yet crispy as well and the salted egg yolk sauce brought the taste of the waffles to an ever greater level~ It is a wonderful combination
Brought my parents over since we were in the area looking for dessert. Honestly the idea of the ingredients seemed to have bothered dad, but mum was so intrigued by it she thought she needed to try it. They described it as a crisp, dense and fluffy waffle with salted egg sauce similar to the flavours of salted egg in moon cakes. I chose the Green Tea flavoured ice-cream (can\'t remember the exact name) which was creamy with a soft hint of matcha bitterness, and dad chose the White Peach Sangria Sorbet which was really refreshing yet luxurious with the alcoholic infusion, which tasted also rather similar to haw flakes. Mum seemed to be rather intrigued by the plates desserts which have ran out by the time we reached; shall make a visit for those soon!
Meh. Over-hyped. Enjoyed the waffle at November 8 much more.
Gourmet waffle with vanilla ice cream and additional salted egg yolk sauce. 
Charcoal Waffles ($6) with Cookies &amp; Cream Ice Cream (left scoop) ($3.90) and Hazelnut Ice Cream (right scoop) ($3.90). The charcoal waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, tasted like heaven 😍 The hazelnut ice cream tasted really good too. The cookies and cream, however, felt like I was eating sugar. It was really too sweet, and it was like I was eating plain sugar. 
What we have here is the Blackforest Brandy Sphere($4.50)- I was abit excited and nervous popping one of these into my mouth, it wasn\'t very big but neither was it thatttt small. \n<br />After placing it into your mouth, one slight pressure and \"pop!\" and liquidity substance explodes in your mouth, bursting with flavour! And after you swallow, you\'ll taste the chocolate cake crumbs and dill scathered on the sphere. And the dill, strangely gave me a fillet-o-fish taste in the end.
Have a great weekend everybody! How about some Fatcat Original Waffles ($5) with Butter Beer Ice Cream ($4.50)? First time trying this unique flavour and I must say that it\'s beginning to grow on me. However, my first choice will still be the Pistachio.

Perhaps I have a weak spot for powders. The crumbs of Portico\'s signature Deconstructed Blackforest, the addictive Milk Pork from Two Chefs, or the simple satisfaction of downing Milo straight from the packet in OBS.
Part 2 of the Coffee &amp; Tea set ($12), which is also my favourite, has Earl Grey Granita and White Peach Pâtés de Fruits. The granita is light and refreshing, suitable after a heavy meal while the pates de fruits are an after-meal candy that is chewy flavoured jelly in sugar.  
Continuing from my Fatcat post, this is part of the Coffee &amp; Tea set ($12) and the first course involves a duo serving of espresso ice cream with white chocolate, baileys foam and grated cinnamon. Accompanying the drinks is a sharing plate of dehydrated madeleines with raspberry passionfruit segments and mango chilli tea ice cream. Unique dessert and especially the mango chilli tea ice cream, which hits all the right buttons.
If you have been to Fat Cat Ice Cream Bar, you would have notice many tables ordering these sphere-liked desserts. The recommended way of eating is to put the entire sphere into the mouth and once popped, it will result in a burst of flavours. A very unique dessert and not commonly seen in Singapore. Pictured is the Blackforest Sphere ($4.50).
You cannot miss out on this signature \"pouring salted egg yolk sauce ($1) over the ice cream\" shot at Fat Cat! The smart people behind Fat Cat figured out that Singaporeans took a liking to salted egg in recent years and cleverly incorporated it into their offering! Pictured here is the charcoal waffle (their gourmet waffle priced at $6, normal waffles at $4.50) with earl grey lavender and thai milk tea ice cream ($4.50 per scoop for premium flavors). Fell in love with the waffles at first bite as it was crispy on the outside and remained extremely fluffy on the inside. The savory salted egg yolk really lifted the flavor of the entire waffle, which kept us wanting for more!! The salted caramel sauce makes a good plating but might be too much which overpowered the ice cream at times. It\'s good to go early (before dinner) as there are limited gourmet waffles everyday! 
One of the best waffles I had so far! It really crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside, the sweetness of the vanilla icecream match perfectly with the salted egg yolk sauce.
Served in 2 parts like an after dinner dessert course, Fat Cat revamped it with a twist that you gotta try it yourself as the dessert came as a surprise while you grinned at its creativity.
So we decided to end the week with some Gourmet Waffle with Pistachio and Earl Grey Lavender ice cream (and Blackball after that lol fatdieus). Waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Ice creams were flavourful but not overwhelming. Anyway, HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY @vangoesvroom! Meet for lunch someday when I am back in office!! Experience at Fat Cat Ice Cream Bar: [www.fatliceeats.wordpress.com]
I\'ve never seen such perfectly shaped waffles before haha super super SUPER crispy and the smooth salted egg sauce was perfect with the combination :  ) gourmet plated desserts at an affordable price.... how to say no!!!?
The gourmet waffles tasted pretty mediocre. They weren\'t soggy(which is a good thing) but they weren\'t all that crispy either. The egg yolk sauce was kind of grainy and not to my liking. The ice cream tastes pretty normal too. But loved the salted caramel sauce as always. 
Flavours exploding in your mouth! Its on the pricey end at 4.5 per ball. But worth the try! Will definitely try other flavours when I visit again. 
Black charcoal waffle, w/ butter beer and thai milk tea for $16. Doubt that I\'ll go back again :/
The lavender taste from the charcoal waffles was a little too strong for my liking. Think I will order their normal waffles the next time. 
Couldn\'t have a taste of it because milk tea tend to trigger my bowel movement, but my partners commended on the sweet-bitter balance which was pretty well played in the drink.
Tried three of the flavours along with their plush, fluffy buttermilk waffles. Hazelnut was rich and creamy while being Ferrero Rocher-like in flavour, while the Blueberry Cheesecake was bold in cheesiness but tastefully subtle in the sweet and tart berry flavours. Banan Caramel was a tad ripe tasting today though, possibly due to the bananas used in this batch of ice-cream.
Yeah, by looking at the title of this photo, it\'s enough to understand how crowded will be each time you visit this place. Although it\'s another neighborhood café, but transportation to FATCAT is never a problem where it is just 5-10mins walk from the Bedok MRT. Anyway, talk about food, the gourmet waffle just OK for me as I will prefer original waffle that tastes sweeter. The ice cream itself has so much of variety sounds from butter beer, banana caramel, Thai green tea, hazelnut, pistachio and many more. Remember, if this is your first visit, never stingy on spending $1 for the salted egg yolk topping for the waffle and ice cream, else you will regret! And....they so serves $5 each of mini glass of moscato to cure your thirst! 
Glad to say it\'s not too bad. 😊 better without the salted egg yolk sauce though. #burpple
Can\'t really remember what was this but all I can remember was that it tasted good.
Very interesting mixture of somewhat savory and sweet! It was very filling and I chose the butter beer ice cream to go with it and I think it went quite well with the salted egg yolk! 
FatCat has been making waves in the local creamery scene with their Gourmet Waffle: charcoal waffle with salted egg yolk sauce that seems to go with just about everything, and their popular Butter Beer Ice Cream. The buttermilk waffles here are crisp, light and airy. The Butter Beer Ice Cream will delight those who love beer, with its strong flavour. If you\'re not a fan of beer, opt for Watermelon Soju or Hay &amp; Honey! They also do interesting plated desserts like the Banana Nutella (pictured) and Tarte Au Citron (brandied Cherry Sorbet, cherry gel, crumble, laksa leaf meringue, lemon curd and yogurt gel) that vary daily, with limited servings.
Waffle was crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Banana caramel ice cream was super yummy. You get a taste of banana and caramel at every bite and it\'s well paired with the waffles 
Have u ever tried, charcoal waffles? apparently, they said eating charcoal helps with gastric, correct me if im wrong. however, our verdict for the waffles, it could have tasted better without the salted egg sauce. we had the thai milk tea ice cream, and it wasn\'t a good combination. well, its our second best waffles hang out place, def. prices ranges around:$6-12 (additional ice cream) 
I like the slightly crunchy texture. Went for the watermelon soju sorbet (sweet and refreshing, but couldn\'t tell the alcohol) and the hay &amp; honey gelato (really like unique honey flavour). Added the salted egg sauce, but it was a bit too watery and overpowered by the salted caramel and lavender bits which were both much stronger tastes. #Burpple
And this is what sets Fat Cat apart from the many other ice cream parlours out there. Here\'s their highly raved Charcoal waffle w Salted egg dip.

Wohooo...!\n<br />Finally got to taste the famous charcoal gourmet waffle from @fatcatsg after planning over..and over..and over again..\n<br />-\n<br />Trust me, they\'re soooo good. The waffle itself is not too sweet, crispy, yet moist.😋 Eaten with salted egg yolk sauce poured over earl grey lavender ice cream. 😚👌 work of art.\n<br />-\n<br />🏠Fat Cat Ice Cream bar\n<br />• Gourmet Charcoal Waffle [S$6]\n<br />• Salted egg yolk sauce [+S$1]\n<br />• Earl Grey Lavender ice cream [S$4.50]

Doesn\'t the plating of this dessert looks like a garden to you? 🌻💐🌹🌾🍀
\n• Charcoal Waffles\n<br />• Pistachio Ice Cream\n<br />• Salted Egg Yolk Sauce
Saw a few burpplers recommending this and decided to give it a try today! I must say I love how crispy the waffle is! I mad love abt the sprinkles of lavenders on the waffle itself, it\'s really fragrant! Something to praise on for, the caramel sauce on the plate, purrrrfect with the warm cripsy waffle! My advice is that to pour your salted egg sauce on the ice cream instead of the waffle, it tastes so much better with ice cream! We had Thai green tea, banana caramel &amp; pistachio flavours. Pretty unique I must say!:) 
Waffles are gimmicky and not all cafes do them well. Thankfully @fatcatsg does a noteworthy one and I think they popularized the pour over method! The salted egg sauce can be richer la but it\'s still yummy without the egg sauce. New post on www.ms-skinnyfat.com. Active link in bio! Check out the blog if you\'re looking for brunch ideas today. Happy Saturday!
It definitely looks like but the price is so much more affordable. This is Mock Taro [sweet potato consommé poured over coconut panna cotta topped with vanilla gelato and served with a syringe of gula melaka] I loved this, the panna cotta gave a smooth mouthfeel and a melt-in-the-mouth texture. @fatcatsg creates amazing plated desserts, be sure to drop by this place.
5pm and the effects of not getting enough sleep last night are kicking in. Need. Some. Sugar!
this is some real fluffy and yummy ones you won\'t want to miss 😍😍 $5 for the waffles and $3.90 for each scoop of standard ice cream, premium scoops at $4.90/scoop if i\'m right 
If you fancy coconut, taro and gula Melaka like myself, this is something to-die-for. 😛
Topped with pistachio ice cream! Nothing fancy here but the hype with the gourmet waffles had left this on cold turkey. \n<br />Plain, but still good. Especially with that pistachio ice cream.
There\'s always 2 sides on a coin, and there\'s always another way of looking at a situation. Been always stubborn looking at one angle of direction, sometimes changing viewpoint can be refreshing, and producing a good result. \n<br />On the other hand, I need to stop procrastinating and the bad habit of scrolling phone in bed. Need to stop drop and roll! 👋 Happy Good Friday! 🐇🍫
Love the sweet and crisp charcoal waffle from @fatcatsg. I had it with the Mysterious Flavour which is still something I can\'t make out.
It shows how passionate and serious the chef is. This Banana Nutella (brûléed bananas served with nutella powder, nuts and topped with Honey &amp; Hay gelato) has taken my heart away. 😍 And I must say that they have really innovative flavours of gelato &amp; sorbet.
It did not only look good, it tasted good too. And the price for these were very very affordable. Details of these plated desserts in a later post. Thanks @sophiensyy for helping to reserve these awesome desserts and @feimaocharles for the warm hospitality.
Too much hype or probably just a bad waffle day, found the gelato too sweet to our liking. Didn\'t get to try the plated desserts, hope it\'s worthy the venture at my return visit.
After checking out the one week old The Burning Oaks, courtesy of @sophiensyy, we headed to @fatcatsg. I can see why people travel all across Singapore just to try this dessert place. Impressed with the Banana Nutella plated dessert. There were only 10 left by the time I got there. The pina colada spheres were already sold out!
Thai milk tea + espresso ice cream topped with salted egg sauce. 
Charcoal waffle accompanied with watermelon soju sorbet &amp; white peach sangria. It\'s a match in heaven! The waffle is fluffy and unlike others that\'s too dense and moist that you\'ll get sick of it in no time. The ice cream is the bomb. Very refreshing with sweet lingering taste. &amp; you could taste both the watermelon and soju in the sorbet itself! Neither are overpowering each other but rather complemented each other well! Yums! 
One is definitely not enough, I need 3.
Really refreshing and resembles a creamier thai green tea just slightly sweeter.
Too milky for everyone\'s liking. More milk than coffee?
C sure didn\'t want to waste all that on the ice cream when I wanted her to pose for that oh so typical shot. Instead she tried to fill all the little waffle sqaure w that precious liquid gold. Smart girl 👍
haha.
Cosy little ice cream bar for those that stay around the area. I think indeed a few more shots of coffee to wake up. 😴
Finally made the trek down to this highly raved ice cream cafe. The frozen treats are silky-smooth, but very much on the sweet side. I prefer the original waffle, which, although less fanciful (no salted egg yolk sauce), was texturally more successful.
Charcoal Waffle with Butter Beer Ice-cream.\n
We had ours with the butterbeer and their new flavour - thai milk tea. Butterbeer was not really to our liking with the strong beer taste but thai milk tea was flavorful and brought us back to the streets of bkk! Definitely gonna order the thai milk tea again the next time we are back! \n<br />It\'s a pity that they were not serving plated desserts due to their participation in the gelato world tour! All the best! We\'ll be back for more again:)
Charcoal waffles with Hay and Honey ice cream drizzled with salted egg sauce. Yummy.
Charcoal waffles with earl grey lavender ice cream! Yummm this is so good! Tried the gourmet waffle but tasted a little bit bitter, probably cause of the chocolate drizzled on it. 
Charcoal waffles with salted egg yolk sauce and ice cream and also just the plain waffles! Extremely delicious and worth every cent. (About 10 bucks!) Tucked away in a quiet corner in Bedok, it has a nice ambience and it\'s definitely worth a visit.
To try: their charcoal waffle paired with ice cream of your choice tied together with salted egg yolk. Most unimaginable combination ever but it\'s so good. How the saltiness from the yolk matches with the sweetness of the ice cream. I will highly recommend their earl grey lavender and thai milk tea ice cream. Seriously the best ice cream I\'ve ever eaten so far that are not overly milky or sweet. Do give a try to their banana Nutella (which is beautifully plated) and their interesting lime mojito spheres. Caution: don\'t bite into the spheres before putting the entire thing into your mouth.
Had the butter beer and watermelon soju ice cream with the famous charcoal waffles. Surprisingly, the salted egg sauce goes very well with everything.
Burst in your mouth sensation!
FATCAT\'s gourmet waffle, Charcoal waffle with salted egg yolk sauce is decent and worth the trip. The sauce went well with the crispy and light waffle, though I hope that the waffle had more taste to it. I might be back for the ice cream as the Thai Milk Tea ice cream was really good!
A deconstructed dessert that consists of Brandied Cherry Sorbet, cherry gel, crumble, laksa leaf meringue, lemon curd and yogurt gel. Of the individual elements the most unique has to be the laksa leaf meringue; a slab of powdered sugar that tricks the tastebuds with coconut-cum-curry flavours, though the flavours were generally overwhelmed by the other ingredients when combined together. Of course, the lemon curd made this deconstructed what it is, but the addition of yogurt gel adds some tartness to the slight sweetened curd, while the crumbles with the meringue added gives it a tart-base like texture and taste. Interesting though a bit pricey; worth the thrill if you are in the mood to splurge.
Served as pre-dessert to the Tarte Au Citron, this was literally genius! We were told to take a scoop of the grapefruit foam first before eating the granita, and the tangy foam did start the appetite rolling for the pre-dessert. Each scoop into the granita revealed mildly tart Tom-Yum flavoured crushed ice bits that tickles your tastebuds. Instead of the bright and spicy flavours you would expect, it\'s bright but surprisingly refreshing and cooling burst of flavours. Really really interesting and definitely worth waiting for!
Famed for its salty egg yolk waffles and unique ice-cream flavours. However very disappointed with the poor standard of food, lack of service and cafe space. It was just a messy and unpleasant experience. No intentions of coming back. Sorry but thank you. 😅
(Tried to pour it evenly hence the not so pretty picture.) The gourmet waffle costs $6, additional ice cream at $4.50 per scoop for premium flavours which is almost everything. Waffles were decent, crispy and light but not as fragrant as I\'d like. Could afford to give a little more salted egg yolk sauce. What was better than the waffles - their ice cream!! We had hay &amp; honey, Earl grey lavender (fantastic if I didn\'t know it was Earl grey  - couldn\'t taste any hint of that, overpowered by the light fragrance of lavender) and butter-freakin\'-beer which was our favourite!! I\'d very much love to come back for ice cream.
bet most of cha haven\'t tried this seasonal treat here at @fatcatsg before. be patient ☝️
Love this a lot. I need to find a time to go back for more of these soju sphere! 😋😋
🍴 Who\'s with me too? Thank you @sophiensyy for this 🙆
As you should expect from an ice cream bar, Fatcat meets the expectation of serving very good ice cream made from scratch daily. But more than just serving exciting flavours like the well-loved Butter Beer and Hay &amp; Honey, they go one step further by creating beautiful plated dessert experiences. Choose a flavour or two from their 18 ice creams to grace the top of their charcoal waffle with salted egg sauce. For another unusual bite, try their incredibly refreshing Lime Mojito Sphere -- an explosion of zesty goodness in your mouth. New desserts are regularly introduced in limited quantities daily (just like their waffles), so be sure to get there early to avoid disappointment!
tried it yesterday with the yummlicous pairing of hazelnut ice cream and hot chocolate. the flavor of the hazelnut goes so well with @fatcatsg blend of hot chocolate. \n<br />something different to think about whilst visiting if they run out of plated items and waffles.
I must say that they are very innovative and creative because they have really interesting and unique flavours of ice cream. Head down to @fatcatsg to have something different from the usual waffle with ordinary ice cream flavours.
@lepakwithyaops told me that their espresso ice cream is super Gao &amp; thick guess the owner added some Nescafe into it. This is my top list on my recommendation. Faster go try before all their ingredient run outs.
Let me tell u it is their Salted Egg Yolk Sauce i can say is one of the best combination i have ever ate. The drizzle of the salted Egg Yolk Sauce is one of the perfect match with the charcoal waffles. If u wanna come pls come early to avoid dissappointment.
Before that another foodblogger @gwenfoodvolution went before me. This Ice Cream Cafe bar has a unique name. They name it fatscat. Well Fatscat ice cream cafe bar sell something which normal ice cream cafe  dun have it. Let me tell u it is their Gourmet Charcoal Waffles. The owner will baked  limited charcoal waffles  during weekends. When i was there i managed to get the charcoal waffles thanks to @_yaops_. Look like he know the owner well haha. The charcoal Waffles we order is topped with pistacho ice cream &amp; earl grey ice cream. I wanna top up with Smoked cheese ice cream sad to sad it is sold out. @candice.huang @debbiehuang @mademoiselle.melo @rachelziyi @johnbeckz @kenn_evans if u all want  to we can plan again. \n<br />Name:Fatscat Icecream\n<br />Address:Blk 416 Bedok North Ave 2 #01-25\n<br />Operating Hours:1200hrs to 2200hrs Monday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday\n<br />1200-2300hrs Fridays to Sundays\n<br />Closes on Every Tuesdays.
After visiting the ice cream bar for three times, I finally got the chance to try their gourmet waffles with hay &amp; honey ice cream ($10.50). The charcoal waffles is surrounded by salted caramel and lavender petals while a small cup of salted egg sauce is served separately for you to drizzle into the waffles before eating. It\'s a celebration of flavours in your mouth. 
This Nutella Banana was the only plated dessert left on the menu so there was no choice but to order it. Chocolate and bananas usually make a foolproof combination but heaven knows why they decided to add salt in here. Savoury desserts are a major turn off for me, hence my disappointment.
Charcoal gourmet waffle with passionfruit sorbet and salted egg yolk sauce.😋 $9.90.
Their gourmet waffles is done super crispy, topped with watermelon soju and lavender ice cream! Niceee..  
It\'s accompanied by salted egg sauce, not pictured as hand model didn\'t want to work today as she was self conscious 😞😒😔 #burpple
Trick to make sure that you do not make a wasted trip - go there within 2hrs from the operational time. ;p
Will definitely be back for the butter beer ice cream ($3.90) and the gourmet waffles ($6, light and crisp-edged charcoal waffle, salted caramel drizzles and dried lavender flowers plus a most interesting salted egg yolk sauce) 😍
The cashier who served us was friendly and made good recommendation. 👏 It\'s rare for @nckai to suggest trying FatCat because the fiancé is usually not a cafe person. So I took the chance to order two desserts even though we were already full from lunch. Took a little while to shoot and edit this photo, I kept asking him to choose which shot looks better and he says all the same. 😝😝
Came here for the charcoal waffle with salted egg yolk sauce but it was sold out. :/ settled for their original waffle instead. The waffle was crunchy and slightly airy but would prefer waffles with a bit more doughy inside. Love how strong the lavender taste was in the earl grey lavender ice cream. Other than this, the other ice creams lack luster. Probably wouldn\'t go back especially just to try the charcoal waffle now...
😁😁😁\n<br />Using the salted egg sauce provided, it is drizzled over their charcoal waffles, the combo was extremely divine paired up with their beer butter and strawberry cheesecake ice cream. Everything was just simply so good! Highlyyyyy recommended, but come really early because it\'s usually sold out quickly. ✌️\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
Charcoal Waffles with salted egg sauce, topped with butter beer and hay &amp; honey ice cream. Strongly recommend the hay &amp; honey ice cream! 
The salted egg charcoal waffle has graced Instagram accounts all over the country, but its beauty lies beyond the aesthetic - Burppler reviews have come in with high praise about how fantastic it tastes! Sounds like a must-try. Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Jacq Ong #Burpple
Really yummy ice cream here! Clockwise from the top - passionfruit sobert, apricot sobert n grapefruit sobert. But they run out of charcoal waffles and lime mijito!!!!! Sad
the dried shaved nutella was something i didn\'t expect!
it freaking explodes in your mouth i\'m not kidding it was really interesting
It was literally smoked. It was served with a cover that\'s filled with smoke! Very intriguing to the senses. The sorbet goes very well with the passionfruit and pomegranate! Whee!
Lots of unique tastes blended together in this dish. Each taste special in their own way yet not too overpowering in the mix. Worth a try!
The charcoal waffle. Yea, they uses charcoal powder. And it comes together with the salted egg yolk sauce! All ice cream are made in house. We had earl grey lavender and pistachio. Garnish with caramel sauce and the lavander flower. Sinfully delicious!
Very gastronomic. It burst right in your mouth! $4.50 per sphere! Very nice!
Finally got to try the Gourmet Waffles! The charcoal grilled waffles were really crispy and fluffy, going really well with the pistachio and butterscotch ice-cream which were decent by themselves. To top things off, the salted egg yolk sauce drizzled on the waffles really made the meal an overall sweet and savoury one by bringing a tinge of sweetness and saltyness. Definitely worth waiting for it! 😎👍\n<br />#sgfood #cafehopping #burrple #instafood #foodstagram
Nothing says \"I\'m at FatCat\" better than a shot of you pouring Salted Egg Syrup over Charcoal Waffles. The black waffles are nothing to shout about though, which is at best average, bordering on bland.
Charcoal waffle with butter beer and pistachio ice cream, drizzled with salted egg sauce. Have been seeing similar insta posts of this and I had to try it! Love the combination of the Liu shar sauce to the waffle and icecream. However, I felt that it can be quite gilat overtime.
✅\n<br />Money paid. ✅\n<br />Accomodation settled. ✅\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Ai Lim Kopi Mai? ☕️☕️Happy weekends everyone!😘😘
Classic waffles here are eggy yet comes with a soft buttermilk flavour, with crisp outsides and fluffy insides; pretty decent. What makes it so good is the scoop of Banana Hazelnut Sorbet which isn\'t that sort of icy sorbet; it felt like as though it was cold mushed up bananas with a soft chocolate-like nuttiness within.
If you havent tried our gourmet waffles, today is the day to come early before they run out 😉 be sure to say hi! ☺️ #nofilter
After much raving on the Instagram world, I finally tried the gourmet waffle at Fat Cat. It\'s special as it is a charcoal waffle with a side of salted egg (liu shar) sauce, and caramel drizzle on the side sprinkled with bits of lavender. In theory that sounds pretty amazing! We chose two ice cream flavours, Butter Beer and Earl Grey Lavender (sadly they were out of pistachio). Well, the ice cream on its own was good, but together with the caramel and the salted egg sauce it all came together and the overall taste was overwhelming in a confusing pool of sweetness, with no one flavour being distinct. I don\'t know, my friend said she enjoyed it though. Either way, it was quite nicely plated!
I really enjoyed this!! Really refreshing and it tasted so yummy and delightful, but if there was supposed to be alcohol in it I didn\'t taste it. I really wanted more but sadly it was also quite exorbitantly priced at $4.50 a sphere.
The liu sha didn\'t liu. \n<br />All waffles have their bad day, and it was unfortunately mine.
Totally my kind of waffle - very fluffy and I think you can\'t go wrong with any choice of ice cream here. Got the Earl Grey Lavender which has a strong lavender favor and I added on a Peach Sangria sorbet( not shown) Not one to rave or hunt down ice creams but Fat Cat\'s ice creams are totally rave worthy. My only complaint would be the scoop of ice cream is too small. And yes, their service is top notch.
And ice cream!☕️🍨👌you don\'t have to wait long to be served on a Monday post lunch hour.👍
The ice cream here is definitely gonna be mouth-gasmic. So flavorful, creamy and smooth. So many unique flavors like beer butter, hay and honey.... Even the pistachios that they use to make the ice cream is from Italy. Talk about quality. Missed their charcoal waffles and plated dessert 😪 but here\'s a legit reason to go back then hehe. 
What calls the Mysterious Jardin? With almost 6 or 7 different ingredients combined to brings out one flavor. Felt so mysterious after the first scoop. It was rather addictive but I\'m impressed with the taste of sweetness that doesn\'t stops me.
The saltiness of the nacho chips and cheesy goodness blends really really well with the salted caramel ice cream. No doubt the best dessert I\'ve had since my existence 24 years ago
The spheres was incredible, impressive, outstanding &amp; fabulous. Thanks to Charles, the co founder of FatCat for recommending me this awesome Lime Mojito Sphere! Be prepared to be surprised!
The latte was on point. Not too bold but flavourful. Check out their menu, as they constantly make changes to it. The best ice cream there was the butter beer flavour!
The gourmet waffle was very bland, but well made - crispy outside, fluffy inside. The star of this place has to be the gelato! Definitely one of the best gelato around in terms of texture and taste. My favourites are the pistachio which was nutty and fragrant, and the butter beer - think pastry fragrance with alcohol. The salted egg sauce that came with it was very watered down, and didn\'t add anything to the waffles. The caramel sauce on the other hand, was heavenly - not too sweet and earthy. Not a fan of lavender so I found the petals a weird addition. Scoop of gelato is rather small, and premium flavours cost $4.50. 
Nothing short of greatness.. Their menu is out of the world.. I swear upon my life that you have to check this place out
10.01.2015 \\\\ Living in the East rocks because of these. Just a 5-minute walk from home, Fatcat is an ice cream bar that recently opened in the Bedok North area. Disappointed that their gourmet waffles (charcoal waffles with salted egg sauce) was out of stock but there was instant gratification with the grapefruit sphere ($4.50) and vanilla ice cream ($3.90). Definitely coming back for their waffles. 
The recommended beer butter ice cream was one of the main highlight in the cafe. Each bite was filled with strong hints of alcohol taste, heard that the beer from the ice cream originated from Germany. The flavor was so deep and thick, and goes very well together with the Waffles! \n<br />I also tried the pistachio ice cream. which was another great recommendation by the cafe. \n<br />All in all, this place is definitely worth the visit, anytime. Will try out the signature gourmets waffles next time! 😁\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood #Burpple
Tried out Fatcat this afternoon after seeing the charcoal waffle hype on insta over the past days. Their ice creams taste pretty good over the counter, and so we went with the Hay and Honey, Butter Beer, and Pistachio atop an original waffle. Sadly while the mild and subtle flavours weren\'t too bad individually, they were too light when eaten with the waffle. I could only taste the pistachio so that was a tad disappointing. Would still head to Milk and Honey Gelato for my ice cream/gelato fix.
Newly opened in Bedok North Ave 2 is ice cream bar, Fatcat. Offering 18 ice cream flavours made from scratch daily, expect to find fresh and exciting flavours like passionfruit sorbet and butter beer, which can come served atop a salted egg charcoal waffle. Besides just dishing out scoops of ice cream, they serve a range of beautifully plated desserts and drinks. A must try is their incredibly refreshing lime mojito sphere, which bursts into an explosion of zesty flavour. For an ice cream bar, what is offered is truly unique, and Fatcat really does set itself apart from all other ice cream parlours out there. 
😍😍Strawberry Cheesecake. [Comes with carbonated strawberry and grana padano chipas pre desserts]\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Raspberry sorbet, Cinnamon cream cheese mousse, Frozen raspberries, Compressed strawberries, Yogurt foam, Cinnamon shortbread crumble, Lemon cress. #handsinframe #handstagram
Waffles with pistachio and butterbeer ice cream. Guess what I had food poisoning from this! The salted egg sauce on top of the ice cream turn soild within a couple of mins.
We were told that the gourmet waffles were sold out when we arrived but thank you dear @sophiensyy for making this possible. 🙆 Waffles were good, the liu sha dip was even better 👍 And FatCat has probably the best pistachio gelato till date.
Beautiful and sophisticated plating
Surprise, surprise - in the heart of the dense, residential neighbourhood of Bedok pops up a dessert bar with a specialty twist, featuring a cacophany of flavours (butterbeer ice cream, cempedak sorbet, charcoal waffles) plated immaculately. These aesthetic skills are reminiscent of top restaurant chefs\'. You WILL come away with a full stomach and camera roll 😉
This was the best item we ordered. Kudos for such an adventurous attempt at melding so many distinct flavours - that WORKS, hell yeah
I love the texture of the waffle, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The Pistachio ice-cream  compliment the dip imo and goes really well with the waffle.
Thank you @feimaocharles for making it possible. \n<br />Charcoal waffle with Earl Grey ice cream top with salted egg sauce. #wafflelicious
Caramelized banana, Nutella powder, Hay &amp; Honey ice cream.  The perfect combo one would think but the result, perhaps not imho.  The plating is faultless. The dessert itself was overly muted.  The banana for example wasn\'t ripe enough so the sugars didn\'t come through.  The powder tasted nothing like Nutella.  And the ice cream while smooth, is best described as subtly horlicks-y.  Interestingly, the hay flavor is apparently really hay and not another definition of the word.
Deconstructed strawberry cheesecake. This was good. Looking forward to trying their other plated desserts and waffles.
a firm believer of quality ingredients, the ice cream tried tasted genuine, velvety and rich in flavours. do give their handmade marshmallows a try too for it literally melted in our mouths with a refreshing hint of lime. making our calories count on a friday evening!
Had to try this after all the posts on IG.  To be eaten at one go, these spheres were really refreshing.  Gone before you know it.
Pardon for that terrible drizzling; the salted egg sauce was served at the side and I let my friend did the honors hence the mishap. Charcoal waffles were subtle in buttermilk flavour, having a slight crisp yet moist interior and the salted egg sauce was prominent in taste yet not too cloying, hence pretty easy to down. Pistachio was nutty with bits of nuts to bite; went so well with the salted egg sauce to induce a nutty sweetness somehow. Sinfulness that I will never regret!
These were really out-of-this-world good! Each sphere is just filled with lime mojito, which is so fragile it bursts with a single touch, which leaks out a zingy yet dreamy flavour. And for those who wonders what happens to the skin; nope you can\'t feel the existence to it. It just melts in the mouth away with the mojito!
As compared to the lime-flavoured desserts this was overall more subtle. Served with Honey &amp; Hay ice-cream, it comes with brûlée banana and Nutella powder. It\'s lightly sweet, with vanilla going well with the bananas hence being an all-rounder in taste. Nice, but I would probably skip this to leave space for the more impressive items that they serve.
Homemade, these pillowy and sweet delights comes with a zesty flavour of lime to perk things up. Not the cheapest, but it really brings up the appetite.
So greedy today because I nearly tried everything on the menu! Espresso will hit the coffee-lovers very well; it\'s not your typical bitter-tasting ice-cream with just a bit of aroma; the flavour were pretty deep and thick. Butter Beer was strong in the beer aspect, and both actually goes rather well to achieve a spiked espresso flavour actually. 
that beerbutter ice cream perfectly compliments the dripping salted egg yolk. \n<br />as I sit here doing a foot massage, can\'t help but crave for this once more
First meal of 2015 has got to be desserts with the same old people I spent the last day of 2014 with☺️, on @fatcatsg\'s first day of operations 🎉㊗️\n<br />➊ [SALTED EGG CHARCOAL WAFFLE S$6]

If you haven\'t, what are you waiting for? They are open till 10pm today.
Felt like a glitzy, oversized version of those flavoured \"pop\" balls in beverages that explode upon bite, only naughtier and more insidious - you get a citrusy grand explosion with little hint of its alcoholic intentions whilst it swirls in your mouth, but within seconds blood rushes to your head and you get that buzzy sensation and a lust for dubstep and head-bobbing that feels oh-so-strange given it\'s 2pm in the afternoon. 3.75/5
@fatcatsg is officially open today! Already here w the favorite foodies for waffles and for @sophiensyy 🙆 Here\'s Mojitio cocktail sphere which explodes in your mouth 🙊

Definitely loving the Mojito cocktail sphere. The feel of explosion when you put it inside your mouth. And of course the Tom yum granita, served with kaffir line threads. The taste of spice and sweetness at the same time.
Literally an explosion of zing in just one mouthful!One of my favourite pre desserts too!
Look at those cute little specks of vanilla bean! 😍😍😍 Thank you @fatcatsg, @feimaocharles and @sophiensyy for the invitation!Had a great time with fellow instagramers as well!More dessert posts coming up the next few days!
Ice Cream Bar below HDB block wowed us with its atas ice cream definitely! @fatcatsg opens its doors in the New Year on 1st Jan 2015! This is a sneak preview of the upcoming seasonal desserts. \n<br />⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />[ASHTRAY - Smoked lavender soil, smoked ice cream,\n<br />lavender, osmanthus, lemon cress, in a dome of osmanthus smoke] - it\'s indeed a very special smoky dessert. \n<br />⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎\n<br />Plated desserts are priced between S$12-15 and only 10-20 plates are available each day. There will be a variety of 1-2 plated desserts daily (changed every 2-3 weeks) and also subjected to availability by seasonality of ingredients.  
Good morning! [MOCHA S$4.50] another new cafe in the East WOOHOO!! Stay tune for the desserts pics😍
well plated, great textures and a combination of well thought out flavors.
.\n<br />The perfect brunch on a bright, sunny Sunday morning. Counting down to 10 more days 💋
It makes the dessert look like it is floating on soft pillowy clouds.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />These are egg shooters. Chocolate and stout ice cream and strawberry pearls encased in eggshells. It is not too sweet, had a slight bitter tone which was derived from the stout. Pearls burst with tangyness. You cant slurp it like how u do shooters. You need a spoon.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Does it taste as good as it look? Give it a try and decide for yourself.
Put the whole thing in your mouth, bite and let it explode.
Made from Pineapple and Mango, both of my favourite. (Delicious bird feathers included)

Tried out the roasted oolong tea and earl grey lavender ice cream and the unanimous decision was the roasted oolong tea as the earl grey was too milky.\n<br />•\n<br />FATCAT Ice Cream Bar\n<br />Address: 416, Bedok North Avenue 2, Unit 01-25, Singapore 460416\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #fatcatsg #fatcaticecreambar

Served in a glass dome that opened with thick smoke to unveil the dessert, its theatrical presentation was as impressive as its taste.\n<br />Banana ice cream, chocolate and Oreo base wrapped in torched marshmallow. With the smoke, the dessert had an intense smokiness that that accentuated the taste of torched marshmallow and balanced the sweetness of the cold banana ice cream. A dessert that looked simple from the outside but was certainly deep in construct. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies  #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #marshmallow #fatcat
These guys here really know how to make it work with their desserts and drinks. \n<br />This Frozé was an amazingly refreshing cocktail with French rose wine and summer strawberries served as a smoothie-like drink, except it was way much more cool than a typical one.

This was the pre-dessert to the Pina Colada, lime foam with Tom Yum granita.

Was impressed with the range of gelato ice cream, waffles and seasonal desserts.\n<br />Under their Thai special, this Pina Colada was a beautifully constructed dish with coconut, pineapple, rum and kaffir. There were so many other elements providing different textures, we were lost after the lady tried to explained all to us.\n<br />But all that didn\'t matter anymore once we dug into it and was happily indulging in it. Together with the pre-dessert dish, this was an impressive Thai flavoured dessert not to be missed. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #thai

The waffles are great but the ice cream is somewhat mediocre and limited in flavours. Be sure to add the salted egg sauce.

The charcoal Choux was solidly crisp, flaky and aromatic. The salted egg sauce brought a warmth and glorious richness to the pastry. \n<br />It\'s salty, buttery, eggy awesomeness!
it\'s too hot. overly warm.
The vibrant colours consist of chestnut, raspberries, beer ice-cream and everything pretty!

The butter beer ice cream is superb. Really nice and unique whereas for the peach I was disappointed in it. It is so sour and sweet. I wouldn\'t reccomend anyone to order that unless if you\'re really into sweet, sorbet, peach kind of ice cream. \n<br />#fatcat #fatcaticecreambar #Burpple #Burpplesg #butterbeer #icecream #peachsorbet #butterbeericecream #charcoalwaffle #waffle
The combi was perfect. The ice cream was so so but the waffle is really crispy and delicious. I can taste a bit of the charcoal and surprisingly it goes so well with the salted egg yolk sauce because it helps to balance the sweetness in the ice cream 😋 \n<br />#fatcat #fatcaticecreambar #icecream #charcoalwaffle #waffle #saltedeggyolk #saltedegg #Burpple #Burpplesg

The {Reverse S\'mores} are in town - a fortress of torched marshmallow encasing caramelized banana icecream sitting above a crispy chocolate crumb base。
Tom Yam Granita with kaffir like threads ginger and lime air. A combo that probably that may not sound natural for a dessert but it works incredibly well with the infusion of lemongrass and ginger for an oriental punch and the cool ice providing a refreshing respite. Airy and light sweetish ending. Perfect for the hazy conditions :)\n<br />#tomyam #granita #kaffirlime #ginger #limeair #sgcafe #sgfood #foodsg #foodporn #burpple

➊ [Massi Magnum S$6] - mango lassi
Charcoal waffles ice cream
Part of a few flavours which makes up their Magnum series that are handcrafted in-house, though I would prefer to call them Magnum Mini instead for its a more accurate representation of its size. Described as \"Matcha Green Tea and Sea Salt\", the sea salt seemed to be missing, while the Popsicle was bittersweet with Matcha and White Chocolate flavours. Matcha lovers would find this flavour rather appealing as the tea aroma is pretty evident all the way through, but at $6, this seemed a tad pricey considering how many bites it would last.

Spell it backwards: desserts. Which is exactly what I need now. Fat cat\'s crispy waffles with that lovely aroma of lavender, paired with a scoop of their ice cold icecream would definitely do the trick.
😌
:) Here\'s charcoal waffle in caramel &amp; salted egg yolk sauce, topped with butter beer and earl grey lavender ice-creams. Oh, earl grey lavender ice-cream, where have you been all my life and how innovative can cafes get these days? Good stuff in the neighborhood! #waffledatewithhubby #gemsinheartland

The recommended way of eating is to put the entire sphere into the mouth and once popped, it will result in a burst of flavours. A very unique dessert and not commonly seen in Singapore.

Two cups of affogato &amp; the dome shape is green tea ice cream.  Awesome😋 #icecreamlovers #icecream #dessertlovers #burpple #openricesg
Rustic plating but i find it abit too sweet. #icecreamlovers #icecream #bananas #dessertlovers #dessert #burpple #openricesg #opensnapeats
That bitter sweet moment, that bitter sweet taste.
One of the top on my fantastic waffle list! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Went for this to settle my cravings for both ice-cream and coffee. Served default with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, the ice-cream was smooth, creamy, rich and aromatic from the vanilla beans. While the accompanying shot of espresso shot was strong it complimented perfectly, especially with the drizzling of chocolate sauce because it simply adds a soft touch of cocoa sweetness that helps to take away the strong caffeine flavours.

The best description for these lime mojito spheres from @fatcatsg.
☕️
Thank you @feimaocharles for the yummy treats!
Thank you 😉
This is my #throwback this morning.. Wanna laze around and drink latte~ @fatcatsg #sgeats #sgfoodlovers #cafehoppingsg
Despite using Santino\'s blends FatCat does pull a cuppa with considerable quality. This cuppa does have a right balance of milkiness in its earthy and chocolatey body, and is pretty creamy too!
We finished everything! 🎉
And aches... But fatcat makes everything better 😌
Finally I get to try this!!
Waffles are legit. The watermelon soju spheres were amamamazinggggggg 🍉
When this ~explodes~ in your mouth.... Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhyum!!!!

This is their #plateddessert, the Deconstructed Strawberry Cheesecake, basically a strawberry cheesecake artfully taken apart (hence its name) and reassembled to not look like a cake anymore.\n<br />Deconstruction in culinary is a tricky one. In layman\'s speak, it simply means taking the food that are normally combined in the dish, changing their form, and then plating them together in a different way. It\'s not just about taking the dish apart, but putting its elements back together, albeit remarkably different!
(Hope I get it correct) Thank you very much for the hospitality rendered by the good folks of @fatcatsg! You people push the boundaries yet again with this #plateddessert. Loving the receptacle it comes in also. Looks like a continent to me! Very world mappish. Mwahahaha. Presentation is a 201%! Mind blown really! Keep up the good job people! 👍👍👍👏👏👏💪💪💪💯💯💯✨✨✨\n<br />Hope you guys @victorl0 @brighterstar39 @julian_cheong @dee.yawn enjoy yourselves yesterday okay! 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 [Fatcat Ice Cream Bar\n<br />Blk 416 Bedok North Avenue 2\n<br /># 01-25\n<br />Singapore 460416]
The charcoal waffles is surrounded by salted caramel and lavender petals while a small cup of salted egg sauce is served separately for you to drizzle into the waffles before eating. It\'s a celebration of flavours in your mouth. \n<br />#FOODART #local #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #julsmakan #jiakholiao #eat #foodporn #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodsg #instafoodsg #igsg #vsco #vscocam #sgfood #desserts #setheats #fatcatsg @fatcatsg #waffles #icecream #manutd #manchesterunited

hence the half hearted drip
😹😹😹 This is the Gourmet Charcoal #Waffle from @fatcatsg served with salted egg yolk custard sauce and two scoops of #sorbert, the pale pink is White Peach Sangria sorbert, the bright red one\'s Cherry Brandy. Everyone\'s (99%?!?) doing the hands in frame + dribbling salted egg yolk sauce from above #foodshot therefore #buckthetrend by \"accidentally\" tipping the thimble of egg yolk sauce over the waffle for an #actyigeartistic shot. Damn pretentious hor I! 😹😹😹 Had wanted the sauce to nicely fill up the squares of the waffle holes but I damn hungry + impatient + sorbert start melting liao lah so that\'s it, one shot and done! 💤💤💤 That said, time to pay them guys a visit on my next day off!😻😻😻😻 [Fatcat Ice Cream Bar\n<br />Blk 416 Bedok North Avenue 2\n<br /># 01-25\n<br />Singapore 460416]
This is @fatcatsg\'s #WhitePeachPoachedPear #plateddessert. I heard that the plating for this #dessert has changed slightly liao but I believe it\'ll be nonetheless as beautiful. At only $15(?) if I didn\'t remember wrongly, you tell me lah, where else in SG can find. In #Bedok somemore leh, not some swanky atas fine dining establishment hor! Oh, and they\'re close Tuesdays, which\'s a breath of fresh air \'cause every other cafe(99% of them) in SG hor, choose to close unanimously on Monday one leh. So mai tu liao, come pay them a visit now, but a gentle reminder huh, come earlyyy... Otherwise stocks run out fast don\'t cry!😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 [Fatcat Ice Cream Bar\n<br />Blk 416 Bedok North Avenue 2\n<br /># 01-25\n<br />Singapore 460416]

This is so interesting! Yogurt foam on passion fruit granita! Super refreshing!
Check out their seasonal plated desserts!
I rarely can find places which can do both ice cream and waffles well.... This cafe checked all the boxes for me👍 #food #foodstagram #fatcaticecreamsg #burpple #instafood #sgfoodies #sgfood #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #eatoutsg #SingaporeInsiders #waffles #omyfoodie #fatcatsg #foodgasm #sgcafefood #foodporn #sgig #foodphotography #sgfoodporn
Cannot get enough of FatCat\'s Lime Mojito Spheres!
Served with Salted Egg Sauce, which complement the taste perfectly. Decorated with caramel syrup and tiny bits of lavender on the outside too!
Happy to meet the two of them today!
That butterbeer ice cream with salted egg yolk is the best unique combinations I\'ve probably tried in a while. ☄🙇 Thanks hand model 👋 : @quirkyreads #sgfood #igsg #sgfoodies #instagramsg #foodphotography #instafood #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodblog #openricesg #8dayseatout #burpple #yummypin #sg50 #sg50signaturefood #sgfood #sgfoodies #thefoodstand
Lol!\n<br />Hope I did justice this time round, no melting!\n<br />The pale pink one is White Peach Sangria and the bright red\'s Cherry Brandy.\n<br />Don\'t you think the sorbets and the heliconias in the background they look matchy matchy?😻😻😻\n<br />#cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping #bedok #inthegarden #amongstplants #thingswedoforgoodlighting #burpple #instafood #sgfood #vscofood #communityfirst #foodstagram #foodshot #foodgasm #foodie #foodpics #foodporn #foodpornsg #foodstamping #ilovefood #getinmybelly #eatandeat #dessertsovereverything #heliconia #sorbet #cafehoppingteam

Just a 5-minute walk from home, Fatcat is an ice cream bar that recently opened in the Bedok North area. Disappointed that their gourmet waffles (charcoal waffles with salted egg sauce) was out of stock but there was instant gratification with the grapefruit sphere ($4.50) and vanilla ice cream ($3.90). Definitely coming back for their waffles. \n<br />#FOODART #singapore #local #makan #burpple #julsmakan #eat #foodporn #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodsg #instafoodsg #igsg  #cafehopping #icecream #fatcat #bedok

A must try if you come to FatCat Ice Cream Bar! Salted egg sauce all over the charcoal waffle! Definitely worth the travel to bedok! \n<br />For my friends who always ask me which cafe to go or where to have desserts, this is the PLACE! Ice cream made from scratch with the best ingredients!! Remember to try their pistachio ice cream too, i would say it is the best in Singapore! 👍👍👍#fatcatsg #waffle #gourmetwaffles #sgeats #icecream #singapore #foodporn #desserts #fatdieme #shinforeverhungry #musttry #burrple  @weihanweihan @qiz_onli @feimaocharles

opening its shutters today, @fatcatsg is touted to be the next big thing to hit our shores. tried it yet?
.\n<br />|\n<br />Smoked lavender soil,\n<br />Smoked ice cream,\n<br />Lavender, osmanthus,\n<br />Lemon cress, in a dome of osmanthus smoke.\n<br />.\n<br />| \n<br />I thought this would taste very normal, but I was wrong. Who would expect smokey flavour in ice cream?Seriously, I was impressed. official opening on the 1st Jan 2015!MUST visit!!\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Hand model - @shauneeie
[All plated desserts\' price ranges from $12-$15] keep a look out for it when they officially opens on 1 Jan 2015!
