Too many dishes I shall skip the names üòÖ But all gooood foooood!\n<br />#burpple
No wonder the braised pork cheek are the favourites here.
A sweet and savory french toast, strong coffee and of course, the boy. ;)
The prawns are fresh. The tomato and the Japanese cucumber is juicy!
Poached eggs with pork cheek. Its yummy that a 5 yrs old can even finish all by himself. 
A cup of caffe latte that speaks no words but more than actions. It was well-pulled by the main barista and it was served by a friendly staffs who had kept the ambience a little much better with their excellent customer service which was given.
Two poached eggs, braised pork cheek, rocket, hollandaise sauce and english muffin
Two poached eggs, smoked salmon, rocket, hollandaise sauce and english muffin
Beans from Liberty Coffee
Here to try the coffee by Liberty Coffee but we couldn\'t resist the temptation of the Banoffee Cake which happens to be the crowd\'s favourite! :)
breakfast - nice scrambled egg with nicely toasted bread and honey glazed ham
Never mind the no art for my coffee, at least it still tastes decent. Now will the table next to me lower down their volume.
Alright. A little too much heat from the copious amounts of black pepper and dried chilli flakes though. The pork cheek wasn\'t too bad at all
Meh.
Sandwich was really great, love the toast\'s texture, ham was thick enough and tasted just right (not too salty). Nice ambience although the lighting wasn\'t exactly good for photography. Price was a little high but I think it\'s worth it. Will visit again. 
Sundays are meant for brunch! Not this weekend for me since I\'m on diet. In the meantime, do check out Flock Cafe\'s brunch menu for me!
#brunch with #bananaramas! Awesome company but lousy food and place.
Average, but if you\'re ordering it, share it! $12.90
Eggs Sally- poached eggs with hollandaise sauce over smoked salmon and English muffins, topped with some rocket leaves! Yummy! $15.90
Thought tt their waiting/queuing system cld be more organised. 
Not quite smooth. I\'d recommend to go for the food.
if i could critic, the eggs could be a tad more cooked as it was super runny... a good way to start de week. simply love year ends.
Verdict: stick to their scrambled eggs. French toast was good too but super sinful! #brunch #onthetable
Always love their eggs. And their coffee tastes better now! #brunch #onthetable
Sourdough and scramble is a perfect combination for a weekend brunch. Topped up another $4.50 for smoked salmon. 
Scrambled egg is a breakfast item sadly taken for granted and often not well done. Not this one. Creamy and eggy are the adjectives for this. 
$15.90. Don\'t really like the toast which was quite dry. Not the best eggs that I\'ve tasted. 
$14.90. The bread has a muffin like texture. Didnt really taste much of the mozerella which I really enjoyed as its not overpowering. Great for sharing!
obviously a half chowed egg. took this after many bites into my bruch. the yolk is perfect! the portion is sad though... i could do with another set of this.. maybe not.. 
B.R.U.N.C.H with my two best friends since primary school and kindergarten! Food weren\'t nice but it was an awesome catch up! Ordered eggs sally,eggs ben&amp; big breakfast! Ambience was good but waiting time was damm long! Food wasn\'t as good as expected. The poached eggs isn\'t that nice. The toast was super hard and it wasn\'t hot when it is served to us. The smoked salmon\'s portion is really little thou :(
Just a few steps away from earlier establishments such as the popular 40 Hands, and also PoTeaTo, Flock exudes its own unique charm - casual, laid back, a little chi-chi, yet not too crowded on a weekday afternoon - which I like ;) Thought the Gryphon tea (S$5 single tea bag/cup) could be a little cheaper though :p Outdoor seats are great for pet owners.
Crispy and tasty sandwich. Pork is really tender. The only downside is that the salad was a bit messy and the dressing was a bit weird.
Beautifully made with strong coffee aroma, bet you could get hooked to this!
have to be one of the signatures as it was served almost on every table. while the sandwich was tad lacking in color presentation, the shreds of braised pork stole the show. a delightful moist retains on the meat and the half melted gruyere cheese lends a sharper taste. enjoyable overall but the greens could do with more dressing.
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow!
Eggs Sally, French toast with bacon and mocha, with the coffee art!(:
Sorry for the awkward photo? Too hungry to spend any more time to arrange them at a better angle! üò¨

The brioche was a little too dry and crusty for my liking too üòî #burpple
The coffee overpowered the cinnamon and I couldn\'t taste anything orangey. Sadly, they do not have the soy milk option. But they do offer low fat milk instead. #sgfoodsteps #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #igsg #burpple #openricesg #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #mocha #coffeefix
Will be back for the hearty sandwiches!
An admirable twist to the usual eggs benny, but I wished they stuck with brioche (instead of english muffins). Hollandaise was quite bland as well, meh
Love their scramble eggs and sour dough however wouldn\'t order their smoked salmon again! Too salty. Suppose their seasoned it so much just to cover up the fishy taste? 
Go for the Pork &amp; Gruyere sandwich, or a dead-simple, spot-on plate of scrambled eggs and toast! Photo by Burppler Perry Ong #Burpple

One word to describe it - Tasty!
Must try
First try over here, the toast kinda burnt and hard. Service average. Price kinda overpriced. Not worth going second time.
Busy busy. #flatwhite

A place for quiet thoughts
One of them Cafes at tiong bahru, I was looking for something interesting to discern Flock from the rest. I ordered the French toast with maple and bacon, a standard item at most brunch places, and it was actually quite delish. The toast was thick, had an adequate amount of eggy-ness to accompany the sweet maple and savory bacon slices. While I generally prefer my bacon crispier, the bacon seemed to have rolled around in the honey for quite a bit, to give it the sweet aftertaste that kept me craving for more. The iced chox wasn\'t anything out of the ordinary, but it was suitably pleasant and not overtly sweet, just as I liked it. It may be hard to carve a niche out for itself in this saturated cafe area of tiong bahru, but the food\'s decent and the price acceptable so I\'m sure people, including myself will be back. 3.75/5 #flockcafe #frenchtoastwithbacon #icedchox #brunch #western #secretlifeoffatbacks

Dense, moist and full of banana flavour
scrambled eggs, portobello, toast #sgfood good morning!
Just like last year, PV cupcakes and now peperoni\'s for @mariaheng\'s birthday dinner!
bacon was wickedly salty and crunchy too. 4/5
What\'s better than having pancakes on a beautiful Sunday!üòä‚òÄüåà #sunday #breakfast #pancakes
Portobello mushroom sandwich was good 
Freshen up your day with a cup of coffee at $5.50.
