Every bit of it was tasty, from the Camomile honey parfait to the almond sponge and coconut biscuit. And they all came together really well to brighten up the day with great flavours.
Non-Entree Desserts is one of those places that always somehow manage to outdo themselves every time. I had their Pumpkin Avalanche, a pumpkin variation of their famed pioneer, the Chocolate Avalanche. This dessert\'s inception is attributes to their menu\'s current, which is in fact, urban garden.
Enjoy your well deserved public holiday today !\n<br />Here\'s a boomerang of @nonentreedesserts new pumpkin avalanche :p maybe a little too early for Halloween haha
Sweets after dinner is a definite must, glad we chose to walk over to this cafe all the way from Little India after our dinner to try out the famous lava cafe. I\'m all for the presentation of the dish and it\'s incredibly satisfying to cut into the cake and watch the \'lava\' spill over the ice-cream and cookie nougat crumbs. I liked the mix of textures, soft and creamy from the cake and ice-cream, complimenting the crunch from the brittle and crumb bottom. And the combination of flavours were all well-thought out. There was an ice-cream bar there too and I got a scoop of the Black Sesame: luxuriously creamy and rich in flavour. This is a dessert place I\'d definitely recommend. 👍🏻😋

This Ike bowl that looks like a Japanese pond not only looks aesthetically fantastic. The blend of flavours was done well too! I particularly enjoyed the mochi combined with sesame ice cream and sesame biscuit. It\'s something I can order on it\'s own and enjoy it as it is! This is a perfect place who loves food photography and desserts.
An understated gathering of disparate elements with very strong individual personalities - the \"fish\" was stickily sweet in its alcoholic umeshu glory; the pebble consisted of a milky matcha core encased within a doughy, chewy skin; the black sesame gelato and accompanying sesame brittle had a grainy, granny appeal; and the aged sake consommé, to be poured by the customer into the bowl to form the titular pond (ike or \"池\"), was essentially a slightly woozy M18-rated soup-tea. Comes across as a thoughtfully conceived and executed concept as opposed to a calculated and soulless \"Instagrammable\"-geared cash-in, which in itself deserves mucho kudos indeed. 4/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Non Entrée Desserts.
The popping candy, soil and pebbles offered gravelly chocolate crunch in spades, whilst elsewhere the prosecco rosé jelly was a delirious, wobbly tease and the strawberry rhubarb compote an electrifying bolt of sweetly tart lightning. 3.9/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Non Entrée Desserts. The dessert also comes with a perfume pump (unpictured) which you can apply either on the dish for some floral refreshment or yourself if you reek of piggy boniness from the Bak Kut Teh next door.
Non Entrée has just launched their new series of Urban Garden themed sweet treats! Our favorite was \'Ike\', Japanese for pond, delicately put together with different elements - Matcha Mochi pebble, a thin crisp sesame brittle, Goma gelato and an Umeshu flavoured sweet koi fish just beside. The pond\'s water is represented with a pot of light yet fragrant Hand Roasted Sencha with Brown Rice. So many things happening but that pour helped to bring it all together. Not cloyingly sweet but refreshing and soothing!

:( It is so cute i just want to look at it, instead of eating it. it does not taste as good as it looks though. XD This was part of the valentines set meal from Non Entree Desert.
Aesthetically pleasing rubber ducky that is actually made up of mango sorbet, it came perching atop thecreme fraiche pudding, sago pearls, mango puree, taking a lemongrass bubble bath. The mango sorbet is a little hard to break in with the fork but surprisingly isn\'t too hard on the teeth, melting within our warm cavern with a strong sweet scent of mango. The lemongrass foam complements well with the mango sorbet and I liked it a lot. There\'s also the sago pearls sinking right at the bottom of the bath and have a chewy texture to it though I\'d prefer if it\'s softer. This definitely surpasses my expectations and I prefer this more.
🔸\n<br />This is so cute! It\'s like a mega tu tu kueh that looks round and cuddly. This is also my favourite cake out of the 4 we tried that day. Made from coconut vanilla, gula melaka and almond. It\'s not only an instagrammable cake, but a delightful one too :)
-\n<br />The gem biscuit (pictured, $10.90) is crafted to look exactly like the old school biscuits that are popular back in the 90s, except that this is multiple times of the original size and price, of course. The outer layer is made of milk chocolate mousse, with apricot and almond centre. Instead of the typical icing top, this rendition came with meringue, retaining the iconic bright colours still. Despite made with these ingredients, it turned out to be less sweet that I had expected. Savour it slowly to enjoy the layers of flavours, while reminiscing the good old days.\n<br />-\n<br />Handmodel: @justinfoodprints
Creativity with a human touch here. This ang ku kueh struck a cord with me and my love for Singaporean heritage food.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is actually strawberry jelly encasing a strawberry curd centre, laid on top of a shortbread base. The taste is strangely similar to hawthorn though. Fruity, but could be too sweet for many, including myself.
These 2 words came to my mind when I first saw this - though this was nothing like the original tu tu kueh that I got excited at basar malam (aka night market) when I was a kid. Such is exactly the draw here at @nonentreedesserts - the creative chef\'s forte to create desserts that are delectably surprising. Full marks for the efforts!\n<br />_\n<br />Made of coconut mousse, gula melaka and almond, it is light, refreshing and totally perfect for a post dinner treat. Now it\'s time to grab the real tu tu kueh!\n<br />_
I knew this is the one for me when I saw this elegant cake sitting in the display shelf looking like a princess.. with her white chocolate tiara, sugar daisies necklace with gold flakes, and baby pink floral dress.\n<br />🔸\n<br />But this love was short lived as I tasted her champagne infused mousse with berries and lychee interior.. 💔
.\n<br />Expectedly an unbelievable dessert reinvention of one of our local favourite hawker dishes. It took me totally by surprise how familiar the texture of the individual elements were, especially &amp; notably the springy &amp; firm \"noodles\" (swipe left to last image). My brain was slightly confused by the continuous hit of savoury notes on my palate, as I was expecting the 360 degree change with pure sweetness.\n<br />.\n<br />Overall an interesting creation that\'s worth a shot, though it\'s definitely one of those novelty items that\'s either a yay or nay. Personally not something I\'d appreciate a second time, but I trust in giving credits when they deem fit - I do genuinely admire the efforts that went into \"Back to the Future\" theme menu, from conceptualising to launch &amp; daily production. Have yet to try their \"Singaporean Breakfast\" which is also under this new menu, but guess it wouldn\'t hurt to try, right?
(2) Bak Chor Mee ($14.90) - super fun to eat mango vermicelli \"noodles\". Pleasantly surprised by raspberry reduction \"chilli sauce\" while tossing this dessert 😂 + ingredients like sesame snow \"minced meat\" (3) Chocolate Avalanche ($13.90) - fave!!! Warm Valrhona dark chocolate lava flowing onto chocolate soil, crunchy almond nougatine, &amp; the winning ingredient: orange-infused vanilla gelato. (4) Pandora (priceless): only one in the world from @dareren 😘❤❤ THANK YOU DEAR 😍 #burpple #dqky
Eau De Champagne ($9.90)
Tu Tu Kueh ($8.90)
Gem Biscuit ($10.90)
Ang Ku Kueh ($9.90)
Sadly, this dessert did not suit my taste - I found it to have a strange sourness... But there is no denying it\'s been painstakingly crafted and is prettiness personified.
dehydrated toast with kaya parfait:\n<br />the eggs - chocolate mould that spills half boiled egg yolk n egg white when cracked open...
looks like one of s\'pore\'s fav local dishes - but is actually a dessert! mango vermicelli, sesame crumble, coconut, sea cocknut and balsamic vinegar. The noodles are an inception - marvel at its al dente texture.
$13.90\n<br />Cut the cake in half to let the lava flow out before fully cutting the biscuit out to let the cake drop into the bowl. A mix of hot and cold, a great combination!
$14.90 \n<br />Good for people who enjoy desserts which are not too sweet! The dessert isn\'t a dish that would leave a deep impression in terms of flavor, but the concept itself and how realistic the Bak Chor Mee turned out is something I would definitely remember. The dish was just average and I honestly wouldn\'t return to Non Entrée to eat this dish again, but will definitely return to try the other desserts.
This luxurious dessert is composed of Dark Chocolate Cherry with Kirsh and Mascarpone Foam, Earl Grey Jelly, Chocolate Soil, Marinated Cherry Compote, Flourless Sponge, and Spicy Cherry Sorbet 😱 .
The idea is brilliant! Everything is edible including the egg shells. P.S. Those arent real eggs and the liquid in blue cap bottle isn\'t a soya sauce 😏
💕 As we sliced the matcha lava cake, the warm lava dripping unto the green tea gelato atop the chocolate soil with crunchy almond nougatine felt like we\'re in a fine dining. ❤️\n<br />#burpple #simplejoys #desserts
🤔 But when this beautifully arranged dessert in a shape of lemon surrounded with \"planted flowers\" came to our table, the three of us just said...\"Woah!\" 😱
Beneath the elegant appearance, you\'ll find champagne-infused mousse, lychee and berries married well together. Their flavours complements each other - the champagne taste remains evident and is enhanced by the lingering fruity sweetness of berries and lychee.\n<br />_\n<br />Launched for valentine\'s day, I\'m not too sure if this will be available for long, so try this eau de champagne soon before it\'s gone!\n<br />_

18-Feb-17\n<br />♡ The thick gooey matcha with the almond nougatine!\n<br />☆ $13.90+
The bear, which is accompanied by a pre-dessert and Love Potion drink, forms the centrepiece of the limited period Valentine\'s Day set menu, and is perfect for both love-drunk canoodling couples as well as bra-burning feminist Singletons (because the brutal murder of the blatantly commercial romantic construct is defiant and symbolic etc etc).
It is packed with Strawberry Curd, Strawberry Jelly and shortbread. Going for $9.90. #tingzieeats #burpple
The coffee aroma instantly explodes in your mouth at the first bite! 😎☕ Overall, the sweetness from the sides makes the dessert so flavourful and addictive. This may not be one of the most popular dishes here but we think this is too good to be missed! 😚
With Chinese New Year round the corner, the folks behind Non-Entree Dessert Cafe which serves creative reiterations of local desserts have released a Pineapple Tart dessert that is in line with the festivities. Using Caramalised Pineapple and Candied Ginger Coulis, the dessert is shaped just the way an exposed pineapple Tart would look like, with the pineapple cubes carrying a little sweetness while chunks of pineapple could be felt for a bite; the candied ginger coulis gives feel of it being a little fibrous within, while it combines with the pineapple to create a little zingy flavour to replicate the flavours of pineapple paste. Beneath, the pastry is reminiscent of the exposed pineapple tart; cookie-like and crusty though it\'s in the shape of a ring; the middle is left completely empty for the caramalised pineapple and candied ginger coulis to sit within.
My favorite place for unique desserts! Always surprising me with the various layers of flavours. This was made up of chocolate on the outside with strawberry and jelly bits on the inside.
Is this really a dessert!? It looks so much like a real one! \n<br />The refreshing combination of Creme Fraiche pudding, sago, biscuit, fresh mango puree and lemongrass foam really surprised me! Who can resist getting one of these cute little duckies? 🤗
Excellent cakes in this hippie cafe along Rangoon road. The former a marriage between raspberry yogurt, earl grey and strawberry Yuzu, the latter with a filling gula melaka and coconut cleverly disguised as a kueh tutu. Kudos to the team for thinking up these babies. 
Served with marshmallow to be toasted. ($16.90) Its like a Black Forest cake with a cherry marshmallow filling.\n<br />TNT - wild strawberry compote, strawberry espuma, luxurious champagne bomb &amp; yuzu sorbet combined with pop rocks &amp; fizzy raspberry rocks, encrusted in a white chocolate dynamite shell! ($18.90) Mark the end of 2016 with a bang ! Love the yellow champagne bomb and pop rocks that explodes in your mouth haha ! Very happy that the TNT is back and everyone should go have a try before it\'s gone !
👯👯 Thanks for the last half a year, and for making this a place I\'m proud to call home. Praying we continue to walk alongside each through the new year (in heart, but most likely also lengthwise). As they say, those who eat together, stay together amirite? MERRY CHRISTMAS ERRYBODY.\n<br />⋅\n<br />🤶: @lkaiying @hotcheekylace @anintricatevein
Is Fresh mango purée &amp; sago pearls are hidden among the bubbles which is again also made by lemongrass. \n<br />The little duckling is a creme fraiche pudding 😋\n<br />Cost: $12.90\n<br />Taste: 4/5, is it innovative dessert that we should give it a TRY \n<br />Location: 3/5, as is quite hard to go without GPS.

When my friend told me about the Bak Chor Mee (S$14.90) from Non Entrée, I was thinking at the back of my mind: since when did NE venture into noodle business.
\"Why so messy one\" some one was asking about this picture I took. It is intentionally so as attempt to take a foodfie in the middle of your gorging down of the bowl of Bak Chor Mee. Goes well with the stained looking menu... 
\"Bak Chor Mee\" - is the sweet version and not the savoury kind. See the photo? It’s actually mango vermicelli “noodles”, mango pudding with aged balsamico “vinegar”, raspberry reduction “chilli”, sesame snow “minced meat”, peanut “lard”, sea coconut “mushrooms” and coconut “fishball” parfait. 
These are molded as a traditional \"Ang Ku Kueh\" pastry which is shaped as a tortoise, an auspicious animal in the Chinese folk stories. Instead of the traditional peanut, maung bean or yam fillings, this has a strawberry and cheesecake core coated with a layer of strawberry glacé jelly.
If you have not already seen it on your feed, presented like our favourite and quintessential local hawker breakfast, their rendition comes with a sweet twist. Like a Kinder Surprise, the chocolate shell reveals smooth coconut panna cotta \"soft-boiled egg\" with a bursting citrus \"yolk\" when cracked open. And flanked by intriguing condiments - gula melaka \"soy sauce\" and cinnamon \"pepper” powder. The highlight for me, however, was the ultra crisp Kaya Parfait Toast on the side. The frozen, creamy parfait though mild in taste had the texture of ice cream and when paired with the thin toast was so good.

I couldn’t take my eyes off the Gem Biscuit ($10.90)
Bak Chor Mee ($14.90). The bowl came with mango vermicelli ‘noodles’ and pudding, seasoned with aged balsamic vinegar and raspberry reduction ‘chilli’. Topped with sesame snow ‘minced meat’, coconut crumble as ‘pork lard’, sea coconut for ‘mushrooms’ and coconut lime parfait ‘fishball’.
Singapore Breakfast ($13.90). While it may look like the perennial breakfast favourite of both young and old, you’d be surprised to know that this is a full-fledge dessert!
Ooey-gooey molten chocolate flowing out from the perfectly warm lava cake😍 The cake was delicately placed atop a crunchy almond brittle and dusted with powdered sugar. Cutting into the cake gives you a sense of awe as the chocolate drips onto the ice-cream; You could taste the orange in the ice-cream, which mixed really well the soft cake, molten chocolate and almond brittle. Definitely a winner but the scoop of ice-cream could have been larger(maybe we\'re just greedy)! Quite expensive though but really an interesting experience!
It can really stay in good shape till we finish taking photo!! 😉
Super impressed by the details of the \'fishball\' that even has green and red dots of \'vegetables\' on it! In terms of taste, I\'m a little disappointed as it doesn\'t taste as nice as it appears.. It was mostly sour (though the mango pudding made it less sour) and the \'fishball\' was the only best ingredient among all.. #burpple
We had the new Kopitiam-themed menu and the \"soft-boiled\" eggs and kaya toast parfait were smashing. It was like stepping into an episode of Heston Blumenthal\'s Fantastic Feasts - Singapore edition. Sweet treats packed into deceptively ordinary breakfast foods, the pale chocolate eggs cracked opened into a gooey mix of coconut panna cotta with tangy yolk centre. The kaya toast rife with just the right amount of coconutty sweetness in a creamy parfait form. Smashing was to end dinner. But while you\'ll probably get the real breakfast set for under $5 at a Kopitiam, these were a hefty $13.90. Also served with a gula melaka \"soya sauce\" and cinnamon \"pepper\" powder. 👍🏼 #nonentreedesserts #kopitiam #breakfast
Singapore Breakfast Set  ($13.90)
For matcha lovers! 🍵 A really well balanced dessert w multiple layers of texture that isn\'t too heavy nor gelat. The only downside to this dish is probably the portion. It\'s a lot smaller than I expected &amp; feels unjust for it\'s price. It\'s probably gone in 5 bites.
A nice refreshing mango sorbet sitting in a tub of lemon grass bubbles 🐤 ridiculously cute presentation! Go for this if you\'re looking for that light sweet snack after a hearty dinner.
A light coconut vanilla mousse cake w gula melaka filling. A really innovative &amp; cute way of mixing traditional &amp; modern desserts!
I wanted to try the photogenic Matcha Avalanche ($13.90)! Matcha White Chocolate Warm Lava with Azuki Beans flowing onto Chocolate Soil, Crunchy Almond Nougatine &amp; Roasted Green Tea Gelato, how much better can this get? 😍 Lava cake was super soft and the lava had just the right thickness. Overall a really great dessert I wouldn\'t mind paying for again, just a little bit small though.\n<br />•\n<br />Check out my full review on my blog! www.foodwithnic.wordpress.com
Bak Chor Mee ! Part of Non Entree Dessert Cafe\'s Back to the Future theme ! Pretty interesting, isn\'t it ? Unlike your usual piping hot bowl of savoury minced meat noodles, it\'s actually a bowl Mango vermicelli “noodles”, mango pudding with aged balsamico “vinegar”, raspberry reduction “chili”, sesame “minced meat &amp; coconut “fishball” parfait. Oh and it comes with chopsticks too ! I\'m always amazed by the efforts this cafe put in to come up with interesting desserts like these ! Like the actual dish, it\'s recommended to mix everything up before having it ! Appreciate the “pork lard” cookie crumbles added for a more crunchy texture which complemented the strands of mango vermicelli. The balsamic was quite strong imo though it certainly have an unique and robust flavour . I would prefer having the Singapore Breakfast compared to this if you\'re looking for something sweeter and really gives a wow factor upon breaking open the chocolate shell of bursting “yolk” and coconut panna cotta.
A very innovative take on turning a savoury favourite of Singaporeans into a dessert — features Mango Vermicelli \"noodles\"and pudding (hidden underneath) with aged balsamico \"vinegar\", raspberry reduction \"chili\", sesame snow \"minced meat\" and a coconut \"fish ball\" parfait; cookie crumbles also added that replicates pork lard. At the start, things can get a little hard to connect here for the mind gets a little messy with the savoury outlook but fitted with sweet flavours. After breaking the barrier though, it\'s actually pretty palatable especially when everything laces up together to give that tangy yet sweet flavour — a very bright flavoured, fruity dessert with the occasional interference of buttery and crunchy cookie crumbles, not forgetting the sea coconuts that add in yet another dimension of sweetness and a good texture that replicates mushrooms. The ice-cream was on point with its coconut flavour, but also a tad sweeter in flavour profile when compared with the flavours exuded in the Tutu Kueh. A really fun and creative dessert that is pretty much worth the try!
Newly introduced with the Back To The Future menu at Non-Entree Desserts. A mousse cake that brings back familiar flavours of what makes a Tutu Kueh with Coconut Vanilla mousse, Gula Melaka and Almond. Think of it as a cold version of the Tutu Kueh — the chilled mousse that carries a strong coconut fragrance while the Gula Melaka adds that touch of sweetness that replicates what one would expect of a Tutu Kueh pretty well here. There seems to be a sponge cake layer underneath that also replicated the texture of an actual Tutu Kueh really well here. Very familiar but very innovative and interestingly different.
Scratch that. I was just messing with you guys, which is what this dish will do to your brains! This is no Hill Street Tai Hwa competitor, not even close. This BCM... is a dessert. From the folks of Non Entrée Desserts, who must take sadistic pride in seeing the confused faces of their diners.\n<br />:\n<br />Close your eyes (or cover the photo) and imagine this... Supple mango-flavoured gelatinous strands, dark red raspberry reduction sauce, peppery-looking sesame snow in small lumpy bits, brown cookie crumbles, a round ball of coconut parfait, and pieces of sea coconut. It\'ll probably look like a pretty layered parfait in your mind... Until you uncover the photo. Trust me, you are going to have a tough time reconciling the saccharine \"nature\" of this dessert with the savoury representation.\n<br />:\n<br />The \"Bak Chor Mee\" ($14.90) is one of the items released in the new theme \"Back to the Future\" or \"那些年我们吃过的回忆”. Some of their other mindf-ing creations include ang ku kueh, kaya toast with eggs, gem biscuit, and 猪仔饼 piglet biscuit... Yeah I say this while making the hooking \"\" fingers because appearances are deceptive. Go with your friends and laugh at the one who\'s the worse at dealing with the psychological play.\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the invite, and @nonentreedesserts for hosting and blowing our minds! #Burpple
Ooo yummm Bak Chor Mee! Oh.. Wait... No.. That\'s @nonentreedesserts\'s Bak Chor Mee dessert! It\'s sweet! 👍🏼 - okay, I didn\'t know how else to break it to you. So their new menu is very local driven, \"soft-boiled eggs\", \"Bak Chor Mee\", ice cream in flavours like white rabbit, has flakes, milo and more. It was a very atas local breakfast. I mean, $13.80 for Bak Chor Mee? Abel lost his shit. Hahaha but it was a screwy dessert that looked like a savoury hawker treat - confusing, but delicious. The strands of \"mee\", mango vermicelli, the fishball, coconut parfait, the \"minced meat\" sesame snow, \"lard\" nuts, and at the bottom, what is usually ketchup, chilli and vinegar, was a raspberry reduction and balsamic jelly. It was (is) a kooky dish to try, fun to look at and even more enjoyable to eat. They achieved a balance of flavours despite messing with the balance of Hawker Powers That Be. Hahaha
@nonentreedesserts new theme menu, \'Back to the Future\' features an array of creative menu items that resembles our traditional food from the past. Singapore Breakfast ($13.90) consist of Coconut panna cotta \"soft boiled egg\" with bursting \"yolk\" topped with Gula Melaka \"soy sauce\" &amp; cinnamon \"pepper powder\" &amp; kaya parfait toast on the side. The consistency of the \"soft boiled eggs\" are surprisingly similar to the actual one. Together with the crispy toast. What a great dessert experience!
Can you believe it? \n<br />The eggs and toasts with cinnamon powder and gula melaka sauce is their new dessert for this theme !\n<br />Also New in the avalanche series is the Horlicks Avalanche ! Look at the awesome ooze of Horlicks white chocolate lava :) !
Believe it or not, this is a back to the future themed dessert by non entree dessert cafe. \n<br />Reminiscent Singapore Breakfast of toast and eggs with a little twist ! Encased in the chocolate egg shell is actually Coconut Palma Cotta “soft boiled egg”  with a yolkporn of Mango. Season it with some cinnamon “pepper” and gula melaka “soy sauce” while you\'re at it ! On the side is a Kaya Parfait Toast ! Much like a kinder surprise, it didn\'t seem much at first until you crack open the chocolate egg :)
Your brain tells you it\'s going to be warm and savoury and steeped in zhup gloriousness but when you tuck in....\n<br />⠀⠀\n<br />Singapore Breakfast. Horlicks Avalanche. Gem Biscuit. Rumball. Tu Tu Kueh. Ang Ku Kueh. It\'s a RetroSin-inspired carnival!
Now this is what I call creative! Rubber Ducky ($12.90) came to us as a rubber duck having a bubble bath; rubber duck was an exotic/intense flavored sorbet (pineapple, apples, passion fruit), lemongrass(!) foam, hidden underneath was a bed of creme fraiche pudding (balanced out the acidity of the sorbet), chewy sago pearls (for texture) and mango puree. Def one of my fav desserts! 
Half occupied on a late weekday afternoon, Non-Entrée (10 mins walk from Farrer Park MRT Exit B) serves only desserts/drinks on its menu. The Matcha Avalanche ($13.90) was too pretty to eat; warm matcha lava cake atop an almond nougatine, w a garden of roasted green tea ice cream on chocolate soil. Cutting the cake lets out a consistent, warm gooey matcha lava that half melts the ice cream, leaving you w messy matcha goodness in a cup. Eat it w bits of the almond nougatine and choco soil for better texture. Downside: too pricey/gimmicky for its mediocre taste. 
Look at how beautiful this dark chocolate cherry dome popped! To crack open so nicely, the chocolate dome has to be really thin. Not to mention every element on this plate was really interesting and nice. The spiciness of that spicy cherry sorbet sent fire down our throats. We wouldn\'t think it tasted mind-blowing delicious but it was worthy for an experiential dining. 😉
What you see is a dark chocolate cherry dome that encases Kirsh &amp; Mascarpone foam, cubes of earl grey jelly, marinated cherry compote, spicy cherry sorbet and a small flourless sponge cake that absorbed all the cherry-ness inside this dome. Chocolate soil (biscuit-like crumbs) and edible flowers by the side made the presentation really beautiful. 😙
The mango sorbet was light and fragrant, complementing the lemongrass foam perfectly. The sago I could do without. 
I didn\'t really care about the warm chocolate lava, cake, nor the orange infused vanilla ice cream once I tasted the divine almond nougatine. There\'s just something magical about caramel and almond that gets me going. Between the chocolate and matcha, I personally preferred the latter. Can\'t resist matcha!
The highlight was cracking open the chocolate shell and eating it together with spicy cherry sorbet! Pretty interesting dessert!
This is the Exotic + Kaya Toast Ice Cream. Love the exotic flavor!! 😋
Ordered 3 types of desserts on my first visit to Non Entree Dessert Cafe. Visually nice presented desserts. \n<br />Rubber Ducky - Surprisingly nice and unique pudding.\n<br />Lava Avalanche - Even though its just a normal lava cake but the effort in the presentation makes it an attraction.\n<br />Cherry Pop - It came with a wow but the taste is rather disappointing though.

\"Warm Valrhona chocolate lava flowing onto chocolate soil almond nougatine and Orange-infused vanilla ice-cream.\"A+ for presentation but B- for the taste :( I had such high expectations for this dessert but the cake tasted overwhelmingly of almond (essence) when I went. That paired with be orange ice cream and chocolate, I just felt like there were too many flavors going on, preventing me from tasting the true richness of how a chocolate lava cake should taste like. I tried the rubber ducky dessert and that was fantastic! 
\"Crème fraiche pudding, fresh mango purée, sago and biscuit.\" Incredibly refreshing for the hot Singapore weather! 
Loving Waffles Wednesday with forest berries and black seaseme 🍦 ! Tangy, sweet and refreshing ^^
Bitter sweet Lava cake, w/ delicious almond (I think) cookie over a delicious scoop of ice-cream. Loving the perfect combination of crunchy cookie, bitter sweet cake (and matcha flow-ey sauce). Totally loving the multi-dimensional texture experienced with each bite. Sweet, bitter, fluffy smooth and crunchy! I cannot tank! Looks good, but taste better!
we loved the beautiful intricate small cake at the counter so much we ordered a whole cake version of it for birthday ^^! Thank you @nonentreedesserts for taking time to make it
Theatrics aside, it\'s a refreshing take on what you\'d normally expect from a molecular plated dessert. The element of surprise is part of the dining experience, thus I shall leave you to solve the mystery of the ducky for yourself 🕵🐥
When I ordered this I kinda doubted it being one of the best desserts because it doesn\'t even look real but when I took the first bite, it was pretty surprising that it tasted good. It\'s worth a try.
I personally liked the matcha one better, just because I\'m not a fan of orange. The roasted matcha ice cream matched the cake perfectly. 
😝 The matcha lava cake was awesome with the flowing matcha lava and red bean onto the hojicha ice cream. However the hojicha flavour was a bit overpowered by the matcha. Overall a great dessert except it was a bit on the exp side at $15.30... We spent 2 hours bouldering and the next two hours eating duck rice, matcha lava cake, ondeh ondeh cake and white cold brew.. 🐷 #burpple #growfat #cafesg #saturdayeats
Enough of savory cheese or salted egg yolk ooze porn because it\'s time to indulge in the sweeter side of life. Matcha cake on top of almond nougatine that erupts onto a bed of chocolate soil, roasted green tea gelato and azuki beans- $13.90
Imo, everything in this dish is perfect to me. Some may dislike the nut biscuit on top which is kinda unnecessary. But I like it cause there is a mix of crunch. The sweetness is just nice with the need of bitterness that all matcha must have. Also tried the black sesame gelato, it was so thick and rich like I\'m eating the paste itself which i really love it. As a black sesame and matcha fan, I\'m very satisfied with the food here. ✨✨
Matcha Avalanche from @nonentreedesserts was a tasty after dinner treat. Not much to say today cause been reading this super intense series called the Southern Reach Trilogy. You can\'t read it all in one go man, it\'s too intense. Sci-fi, fantasy, horror, spies, so rich in its writing, so rich in reality. I feel as though I was nestled in a vividly coloured cocoon of Jeff Vandermeer\'s Area X before being dragged headfirst screaming into reality. A little empty, a little lost and very much in shock. Too intense. Like the intense green of this dessert. Yep, that\'s the only reference to the dessert I can muster at the moment. Although, I feel that their Chocolate Avalanche still triumphs over this Matcha version #matcha #matchadesserts
Very cool desserts that are crowd pleasers. Beautiful cafe serving freshly made and unique desserts that are not only Instagram worthy but also very tasty. Love how the cool matcha lava flows to the bowl.\n<br />Check out \n<br />http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2016/04/food-review-non-entree-desserts.html
A duck, in a tub. It was tangy, a frozen creme fraiche duck covered in glistening sweet gel and surrounded by a pool of icy sorbet and topped with lemongrass foam. If it weren\'t so pretty, I\'d probably not eat it again. Looks-wise, the ordinary tiramisu bar I ordered paled in comparison, but taste-wise, that won. Anyways, I had a duck for dessert. I\'m serious.
Another fun dessert that had us chuckling and gushing. Yes, everything is edible, down to the lemongrass foam. The ducky is made of mango, passionfruit and yuzu sorbet. The \'water\' is made of creme fraiche, sago, and mango puree. Loved it!
What a cute presentation of a cherry \'bomb\'! Encased in a delicate shell of dark Valrhona chocolate, lies a mix of kirsch and mascarpone foam,  flourless chocolate sponge, spiced cherry sorbet, cherry compote and earl grey jelly. Sounds complicated, but they all came together very well to form a delightful dessert! Love that we could crack the casing first too. So interactive and fun!
Finally tried the desserts at Non Entree after seeing so many pictures of them. Totally no regrets. The matcha cake was crispy at the top yet soft enough to crumble and give way to the lava within. It was a beautiful sight, totally photo- and tummy-worthy. Great service too! The manager explained each dessert to us, and how to eat them. Lovely experience!
If this were a dish on Masterchef, I\'m pretty sure they\'d use one word to describe it. DRAMA! \n<br />And dramatic it was. Cutting through the soft molten lava cake as it slowly emptied its contents onto the vanilla ice cream below was a sight to behold. But for people like us who like to take our photos, it was basically a chocolate hourglass as you have about 30 seconds before it\'s over. \n<br />Oh yea, how\'d it taste? Warm lava cake mixing with cold ice cream is always a delight. Mixed with choc soil and a thin wafer to give it some crunch and edible flowers lifted it up a bit. Certainly worth the experience at least once. For people with less of a chocolate craving, there\'s a matcha option too. \n<br />#BurppleSG #whyidonthaveabs #Burpple #NonEntreeDesserts #foodporn #dessert
Is really good! The chocolate lava is so sinful! But I find it quite ex tho. 
Non entrée desserts just rolled out their new creation, the ‘Matcha Avalanche’ prices at $13.90. Delicate cinematic experience is strong in this dessert just like their predecessor, the ‘Chocolate Avalanche’, it was somewhat therapeutic cutting into both the Chocolate and Matcha lava cakes as you watch them ooze and drip all over a decorative ‘garden’ with a scoop of Roasted green tea gelato in this one. Remember when you always take a small slice of cake to pair with your ice cream? Now, with the avalanche, all you have to do is really ‘destroy’ the master piece and VIOLA!
Cut into the moist fluffy Matcha lava cake and watch it flow onto the gelato! This dessert certainly packs a punch with extra crunchy texture from the nougatine holding the matcha 🎂 💚👍😣!\n<br />Not to forget the beautifully piped Pistachio Raspberry 《$8.9》💚 a liking for desserts in green !\n<br />So sorry I rotated the video tho&gt;
A MATCHA Avalanche. \n<br />Matcha Lava flowing down into roasted green tea gelato and chocolate soil. \n<br />Who loves MATCHA here? #danielfooddiary
For you Matcha lovers out there, this is something you cannot miss! Had to make a trip down here as soon as I saw their post on their new creation ^^! Think Matcha lava flowing onto roasted green tea gelato 👍👍👍👍💚💚💚💚
matcha avalanche 😋😋😋 • 
Essentially a luscious mango duck soaking lazily in a luxurious lemongrass spa, using yogurt-tau huay body butter for suppler skin. 4/5
Lovely pistachio raspberry dessert during the hottest period in SG! Be careful guys, stay hydrated keep indoors until the weather gets better!
The lovely appearance is to difficult to resist. Tangy tasting. Surprise!
Love the slight fruity taste that came with it. Definitely, the chocolate flowing down onto the ice cream is like another dessert unfolding in front of you.
👏👏 Chocolate Avalanche ($13.90) from Non-Entrèe Desserts. It tastes as good if not better than it looks! Made up of crunchy almond nougatine, orange infused vanilla ice-cream and my favourite part of it, that warm Valrhona chocolate lava cake. It\'s no wonder that we finished it within a min. 😅👍 For the excellent service too! They gave us complimentary ice-cream due to a slight delay in waiting time. ☺️
Enjoyed our time at non entree desserts with this lovely Early Grey Viola!
A dessert that would tantalise your senses; this earlier grey voila has a good balance of tang and sweetness. It\'s really tasty, plus it\'s so pretty.
tucked in between two famous bak kut teh shop, this is one after meal dessert shop you cannot miss that will set to excite your taste buds ! \n<br />Have some fine dining style desserts made more wallet-friendly and aceessible nearby farrer park mrt!
yummy treats at non entrée today! next level desserts indeed
Meet the Warm Valrhona Chocolate Lava Cake from Non Entree Desserts. Seated proudly on top of a crispy almond nougatine, it seemed to be in oblivion that its end was near. It was just one step from falling into a valley of flowers and a scoop of awesome orange infused vanilla ice cream. Mercilessly, I cut through it and watched while its warm chocolate lava flowed into the valley. Finally, I broke the almond nougatine and the proud lava cake fell. I gave everything a good mix and the lava cake was reborn as a delightful dessert named Chocolate Avalanche.
Happy Valentine\'s Day! May you have mucho lovey long time with your partner all day err day/enjoy an anti-Valentine against this exploitative Hallmark holiday if you are a swinging Singlet/Singleton*. *Whichever applicable.
Yes it\'s true, they do an amazing chocolate lava cake! 
valehona chocolate lava flowing onto chocolate soil aka cookie crumbs with almond nougatine on the brim of the cup/bowl and orange infused vanilla ice cream ! 
New cake addition to their collection! Dainty rose mousse with layers of fresh raspberries jelly and frozen lychee! Perfect for the sweet tooth! 
Warm Valrhona chocolate lava flowing into chocolate soil almond nougatine and orange infused vanilla ice cream
My personal favourite is the Mango flavoured Rubber Ducky ($12.90).\n<br />#NonEntreeDesserts
This TNT dessert at Non Entree Desserts is still available today if you\'re looking for something fun to try out.\n<br />#NonEntreeDesserts #Dessert *
We couldn\'t resist the looks of this dessert, so we headed to Non Entree Dessert for some tea time cakes.\n<br />Basil-marinated wild strawberries, fuzzy yuzu form, lychee Sorbet and pistachio sponge encased in a dynamite chocolate shell. Raspberry pop rocks add a little excitement to each bite and the dessert is presented beneath a \"dangerous chemicals\" tub with yuzu smoke pouring out as the lid is lifted.\n<br />At $18.90, I\'d say it\'s worth a try if you\'re sharing between friends, but too bad yesterday was the last day as it was a New Year dessert (though check with them if they\'re extending the availability). Can\'t wait to see what desserts they come up with for CNY &amp; V-day. Definitely worth the experience.\n<br />#NonEntreeDesserts #Dessert
This festive season dessert is made of dark chocolate mousse and red wine marinated cherries, encrusted in Valrhona dark chocolate sphere. While the taste doesn\'t wow, the visual aspect does!
P.S. The last day to get your hands on this!
May your 2016 be as bright as a firecracker lighting up in the sky!!! 😄🎊🎉
.\n<br />As the seconds ticked by, I can\'t help but to reflect a little on the events that happened this year.\n<br />.\n<br />2015 was pretty much a bitch. Things didn\'t really work out which then gave me the opportunity to went on 5 travelling trips; venturing to new countries and revisiting the old. Gained new foresights as well as met new people whom have made a difference.\n<br />.\n<br />While much uncertainty still looms in 2016, one thing to be sure is that my love for food still stays!
I must have cut it wrongly because the thick flow of chocolate lava unfortunately reminded me of ...erm something else.
.\n<br />Which is the case for this seasonal Black Forest Reindeer [$12.90] that will be available till 2nd Jan.\n<br />.\n<br />Merry Christmas to all as we celebrate  this season of giving with all the good food.
There is enough kinetic energy from all the fizziness from the raspberry poprocks and yuzu form to power a small fart, whilst elsewhere the pistachio sponge smells all masculinely nutty, the lychee sorbet and marinated strawberry basil lend a playful sweetness to the proceedings, and the moscato jelly may leave you ever so slightly tipsy. And yes, you get the entire smorgasbord of ingredients all within one slender package. 3.8/5 \n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Non Entrée Dessert Cafe. The TNT is available from 18 Dec 2015 - 2 Jan 2016.
Black Forest Reindeer Cake (SGD $12.90) from @nonentreedesserts here to captivate our hearts during this Christmas season!
Wow... I think this is very suitable for celebrating a new year. Looks like a fire cracker!! 😄
There is enough kinetic energy from all the fizzing from this citrusy and refreshing dessert to power a small fart, and you\'d be left ever so slightly tipsy.
Definitely not the kind of dessert combination I would usually order but the mixture of coconut and fruity flavours reflects the name \'Tropicana\' really well! A good play of textures and really refreshing with the tangy and cold!
Need a sweet dessert to welcome the busy week with Pick Me Up ($11.90) - constructed with blended Arabica coffee-soaked ladyfingers with a hint of Kahlua, mascarpone cheese, doused in cocoa dust and coffee gelato served on the side.\n<br />The familiar Tiramisu was plated elegantly, almost too beautiful to be eaten. The ladyfingers were immersed heavily with the indulgent Arabica coffee, and the overall Tiramisu pleasantly melt in your mouth.\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
A pretty looking citrus dessert! Fresh lemon curd entrusted in lemon chocolate crust... Laced with poprocks, meringue and lemon sorbet. Refreshing and appetizing 🍋
Warm chocolate lava cake that oozes a smooth flow of chocolate unto the soil almond nougatine &amp; orange infused vanilla ice-cream. A novelty for cake lovers
A job well done by a skillful chef, quality dessert fit for hotel standard but with a reasonable price tag. Creme fraiche pudding, fresh mango puree, sago, biscuit... My exotic little ducky is sitting on a lemongrass bubble bath
A very interesting dessert that wow-ed us! We are supposed to cracked it open and enjoy the good stuff that\'s hidden beneath. I love the Earl Grey jelly, flourless sponge cake and real cherries. Prepare for some spicy sorbet if you have the intention to try. 😂 #ijusthavetoshare #nonentreedesserts #throwback #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #canong7x
Lava cake is too mainstream but this is worth giving a shot. I especially love the sight of chocolate flowing onto the ice-cream. Ooolaalaaaa 😏😋 #throwback #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #nonentreedesserts #lavacake
Love this cute lil ducky mango dessert, not only looks cute but it\'s so refreshing too. Love the lemongrass form. Highly recommended!
Warm chocolate lava cake set on top of a pot of chocolate soil and orange-infused vanilla ice cream. Cut into the lava cake, thick Valrhona chocolate will flow into the pot creating a captivating dessert that\'ll have you savouring each bite.
Outside, a chocolate shell. Inside, lemon curb and my favourite poprock which makes the \"tac tac tac\" sound in your mouth. Simply refreshing and tasty. Didn\'t regret ordering this.
✔️Chocolate Avalanche $13.90 ✔️Strawberry shortcake$7.90  ✔️Waffle w Greentea &amp; Black Sesame ice cream $12.50 😊 
Essentially a pleasing reinterpretation of mango sago dessert - think a fresh, luscious mango marvel having a bit of a spa day (which explains the soothingly familiar smell of lemongrass), relaxing in a bath made from a sour yogurt-tau huay hybrid, with decidedly un-bubble tea-esque sago pearls for crunch. 4/5 
Chocolate walnut brownie, whisky-infused milk chocolate whipped cream, raspberry sorbet, caramel popcorn and bacon (indiscernible) chocolate paper. The popcorn overwhelms the taste of the chocolate and seems more like an avant garde pairing gone awry. The heady whisky hits you harder than you expect which is nice i suppose, but the brownie is barely chocolately or fudgy and leaves more to be desired. Impressive looking, and kudos to whoever plated this but you\'d be better off elsewhere if you needed a serious dessert kick.
A pudding of Valrhona chocolate with a molten centre, chocolate soil, almond nougatine and vanilla ice cream with orange rind. Sad to say this was all style and no substance.
The proceedings felt a tad everything and the kitchen sink-esque, and the flavours at play were heavy-handed. The very spank-deserving whip wore its whisky breath with brutish vigour, whilst elsewhere the brownie was richer than a Russian oligarch and the salty, crisp paper was more oink than cocoa. 3.7/5 
Don\'t be cheated by it chocolaty looks, the walnut brownies drizzled with chocolate whip is infused heavily with whiskey. The taste hit me strongly and I took a while to get over it.  It\'s served with raspberry sorbet, bacon chocolate paper and caramel popcorns which in my opinion became weird additional to the concoction.
Ordered this because Le Citron ran out. Churros too. The brownies felt nothing special, the whip was unnecessarily alcoholic, and the bacon shards were more novelty than royalty. The raspberry sorbet provided a nice, sour tang; popcorn adding a crisp touch of salted caramel. Otherwise, it doesn\'t really dazzle, considering the same price could fetch a multi-component plated dessert at FatCat.
Puncturing the molten lava cake &amp; almond nougatine spills its contents onto an orange-laced vanilla ice-cream. Fun at first, but after a few scoops, my friends &amp; I lost interest.
It\'s loads of fun. \n<br />So back to the brownie dessert, the whisky cream gives a good kick, going perfectly with the bitter sweet bacon chocolate paper thingy. \n<br />The oh so very refreshing raspberry sorbet is a great palette cleanser for the rich chocolate concoction. Although the popcorn seemed unnecessary, perhaps a caramel coated brownie might work better? \n<br />All in all not a bad start for a new dessert place. \n<br />Monster eats Japan. Coming soon. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #Monster✖️Japan
Rubber Ducky ($12.90) a mango puree  sorbet-ish shaped ducky was 好吃又好可爱 soaked in lemongrass foam. Unseen would be the addition of sago balls and creme friache pudding which the whole thing went really well together!
Yet another of the plated desserts available, though this is more of the usual type of deconstructed desserts rather than the more fancy and cute ones that are available in the menu. More towards chocolate, this dessert features Walnut Brownie, Whiskey-Infused Milk Chocolate Whip, Bacon Crisps on Chocolate Paper, Caramel Popcorn and Raspberry Sorbet. While the individual components all did quite well, there seemed to be a lack of integration for a more cohesive feel for this dessert. That being said, I really loved the milk chocolate whip a lot because they were not shy on Whiskey for this one; the alcohol flavours can get so strong it almost equates to having a mild cocktail and the Bacon Crisps on Chocolate Paper was surprisingly savoury. Raspberry Sorbet was also done pretty well; tart yet sweet and gives the dessert different dimensions of flavour. 
Plated desserts are aplenty here and many feature more abstract designs, but this is one of the few that is pretty straightforward, yet fancy in its own cute and innocent form. Replicating a rubber ducky in a bathtub full of soap, the bright and cheery duck is actually a Frozen Exotic Cocktail that is set in lemongrass foam which covers the other details such as sago, fresh mango purée and Creme Fraiche pudding. This is a dessert for the Mango lovers; the flavour of mangoes were prominent through the whole dessert which was tart and sweet at the same time, with a zingy flavour from the lemongrass espuma around. Sago gives the dessert a bit of chew, but the Creme Fraiche pudding at the bottom is the one that helps neutralize your tastebuds at the end of the dessert by being eggy and cleans up the palate for a well-rounded ending.
Finally it\'s Thursday, weekends after come please🙏🏻 [Tropicana S$15.90] - coconut mousse, coconut crisp, pineapple chutney, meringue, passion fruit coulis, mascarpone lime sorbet. Light coconut mousse, the lime sorbet and pineapple chutney added refreshing tinge of sourness in this dish.
•\n<br />Warm chocolate lava cake using Valrhona 70% cocoa, atop a thin layer of crunchy almond nougatine.\n<br />•\n<br />To trigger the \"avalanche\", cut through the lava cake and watch the gooey chocolate flow onto the orange-infused vanilla ice-cream &amp; chocolate soil.\n<br />•\n<br />The citrus-flavoured vanilla ice cream added a refreshing dimension to the bittersweet chocolate. And oh, I absolutely adore the crunchy, nutty almond nougatine!
True to its cheeky name, Non Entrée Desserts is a new café on Rangoon Road that serves all things dessert. It occupies the spot of now-defunct Woodshed, and is vibrantly decked out in bright yellow, white and black. Expect a fun menu of plated desserts that are intricately designed, both in terms of flavour and aesthetics. Be sure to try the Cherry Pop ($13.90) — a giant \"cherry\" that will create a little carnival in your mouth thanks to boisterous elements like the spicy, sour cherry sorbet and earl grey jelly. For something simple but lovely, go for the Pistachio Raspberry ($8.90) cake, which sees a perfect marriage of berries and nuts. Pop by with a friend or two (so you can sample more) after a good meal in the area! 
Vanilla mousse, chocolate sponge cake, raspberry in raspberry sauce and of course chocolate ganache. Very well balanced flavors, a very de-light-ful dessert. 
Here\'s Chocolate Avalanche $13.90 from one of the newest cafe at Rangoon Road, Non Entree. Warm valrhona chocolate lava (70% dark chocolate), flowing onto chocolate soil, almond nougatine &amp; orange  infused vanilla ice cream. The orange zest boosts the overall taste, creating the refreshing essence to it. 🍴 #nonentree
Was greeted rather warmly by the staff. Sat at a table for 4, when we only had 2, and was asked rather brusquely to move in to occupy another table. I was quite puzzled because, there were still quite some empty tables, and sadly not all tables are made equal. The table for 2 was the extremely low kind, and I didn\'t want to hunch over to eat my desserts. Oh well. That aside, the waffle was rather average. Crispy outside, but too airy and non substantial inside. The pistachio gelato had a nice rich flavour, but ruined by the overload of sugar. Priced at $10.40 after service charge. 
[Chocolate Avalanche S$13.90] - warm Valrhona chocolate lava flowing into chocolate soil almond nougatine &amp; orange infused vanilla ice cream. Love the not so heavy chocolate and the tinge of orange.
Essentially a riotous sour carnival in your mouth - the wince-inducing and spicy cherry sorbet projects thousands of microscopic peppery pins onto your tongue, whilst elsewhere the marinated cherries positively burp fizzy soda. 4/5
One of the cakes in the display table available at Non Entree Desserts. This was pretty much what the description was; pistachio cake with raspberry purée in between. Cake was moist and not overly dense, carrying the distinct nuttiness of Pistachio and the Raspberry purée within gives a tart berry flavour. The combined taste is pretty unique and a rather acquired one, but I reckon this something to try before deciding if it\'s going to be your thing.
This place serves gorgeous plated desserts, cakes, waffles and ice cream - an Instagrammer and sweet tooth\'s dream, and fatlessness\' nightmare.
Taking over the space where the former Woodshed cafe used to sit, this cafe has a bright yellow frontage which I am totally in love with Liao. I hope the dessert tastes as good!
It is Tutu Kueh @nonentreedesserts. So beautifully made! Inside seems to be grated coconut with gula melaka. Not a bad dessert to have as it is such a pretty original idea to bring in tradition. Overall is a nice taste to it but I may not come back for another (just a preference as I like conventional pastry cakes). Still this place is pretty cool and inviting for a nice coffee and chitchat though! Service is good and their coffee is worth a try! 🐳 MerRyan is happy! #merlion #merryan #singapore #burpple #nonentreedesserts #cafesg #tutukueh #traditionaldessert
Non entree is not your typical desert shop. It serves playful desert like nasi lemak desert, rubber ducky desert and more. The chocolate avalanche is one of the more normal ones. 
Brightens up the day and your appetite with its delicate taste. #burpple

This dish tasted as summery and cheerful as it looked, absolutely loved it 😍
Dessert it an art ❤️
3/5 for taste wise as there was nothing that caught my attention, I actually stop eating after the first mouth. But then again full score for the neat placement of food!!
The Bak Chor Mee and the Traditional Breakfast may be gone for a long while, but Non Entrée never fails to amaze their customers with their unique desserts.
Good week ahead everyone. #tingzieeats #burpple
The seasame gelato and matcha pebble was the best part of this plated dessert! Went well with the consommé and the flavours were amazing. Skip the jelly koi though, it was a little underwhelming and it didnt feel like it added much to the dessert. 
Okay, it was just drizzling. I really loved the vibe of this place and their desserts are just 😍. 1. Apple (abuden? Banana? 😂) 2. Waffles ( Perfection 😢. you get to pick your own gelato too! My colleague chose the black sesame gelaton and loved it.)\n<br />3. Ike ( A litreral pond 😂 - the more you dig in, the murkier the water gets! Interesting flavours. Matcha, black sesame and goji berries are rather common but this combination with the Dilmah tea was refreshingly satisfying. But I\'m not so sure about the plain sago, good for presentation but doesn\'t do much for me. It would have been better if the Ike had a touch of sparkle or gold as it just looks flat after sunset 😂. Maybe they can consider a different presentation for this dessert in the morning and at night. )\n<br />Would I come back? ABSOLUTELY! \n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #fooddiary #foodreview #sg #desserts #fruit #blackandwhite #bnw #burpple #apple #instamoment #instadaily #instafood #tgif #sweet
later topped with hand roasted sencha with aged sake consommé
SUNNY ($14.90): chamomile espuma, ginger lime fluff, chamomile honey parfait, almond sponge, peach infused peppermint tea, coconut biscuit and lemongrass apricot coulis (my fav), all of which worked together beautifully - a balance of sweet and sour that brought out the delicate, aromatic (the chamomile shone through) flavours of this plated dessert. Tip: try to eat every component together and not individually!
Sounds too herbal and healthy for you? Fret not because the meringue petals and kaffir lime would lend some sweet and tangy kicks to the palette. It was way too pretty to be destroyed (and that gold leaf on top 😍).\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @nonentreedessert for hosting us, and @burpple for extending the invite!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #dessert #food #lemon #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat
Non-Entrée Dessert Cafe has never failed to surprise me with their creativity each time — there is a fine-line in between being innovative and simply gimmicky, and it felt like Non-Entrée Dessert Cafe understands the boundaries very well by creating unique desserts with a character without crossing the line of being just in it for the trend.

The unanimous favourite on our table was Ike (Japanese: pond). The pond water \"hand roasted sencha with brown rice\" possessed a light and unique taste which further enhanced the bold goma (black sesame) and matcha flavour. Imo, the most refreshing part was the seemingly mild koi fish that was strong in umeshu flavour. So delicate and intricate, this dessert easily gave me the zen that I needed after the heavy meal I had.
All thanks to the creative chef 👨🏻‍🍳 The ‘soft-boiled egg’ is made of chocolate. The egg white is made with coconut panna cotta, along with a zesty and citrusy oozy passionfruit yolk that you can burst and watch it flow just like a real egg 🥚 Drizzle some ‘soya sauce’, which is replaced by gula melaka; then sprinkle a dash of ‘pepper’, replaced by cinnamon powder. (How cool is that!) And not forgetting the ‘kaya toast’, consisting of kaya parfait sandwiched between two really crispy toasts. MmmMmmm... I am all ready to get sugar high, BRB 💃🏻 #AATeats #nonentreedesserts #halfboiledegg #kayatoast #burpple #happyeaster
It\'s mid week!💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻 Super looking forward to this week because it\'s a short one! Needed the break totally~ 😌
It is actually made of strawberry curd and strawberry jelly, making this a tad too sweet for my liking.

Flaunting her svelte champagne mousse figure and swerving her curvy red berries and litchi hips, she is the epitome of beauty and sophistication.\n<br />Exhibiting her gold necklace which trumpets a magnificent luster and is embellished with candied daisies, it serves to elevate her elegance and captivates all that is before her.

SWEET!!! It\'s a dessert!
Need I say more? ◾◾\n<br />It is luscious, luxurious and satisfying. Soft, fluffy and squishy marshmallow over the mini flame gives you the warm and fuzzy feeling. ◾◾\n<br />I love my chocolates. Do you?

Raspberry yogurt, earl grey, strawberry and yuzu.
So exquisitely done and perfect for the camera, they cut open to different amazing flavours of light yoghurt, dark chocolate and rich hazelnut within. \n<br />So far their creativity has impressed us so much we can\'t wait to check out what\'s next for CNY! #burrple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #Christmas #nonentree #festive

Super soft exterior of coconut mousse holding sweet fragrant gula melaka but was hoping for a more explosive effect like the ones in ondeh ondeh 😏

How about a bowl of \"bak cho Mee\" for lunch? The noodle is made of mango vermicelli , minced meat is made of sesame snow, mushrooms are sea coconut and fishball is actually coconut parfait.

I fell in love with this man. I wouldn\'t mind returning to try the remaining 2 flavours and their ba chor mee and Singapore breakfast 😍
Very exquisite replica of the iconic bathroom toy, in a bubblebath tub. Yet, every bit of it was edible and refreshingly tasty. Put them together and it was a surprising mango pomelo 楊枝甘露 dessert. Such satisfaction to find something so tasty yet beautiful.

You can see the efforts and creativity of the chefs in coming up with toothsome and chilled items to replace each of the original ingredients.\n<br />Mix them all up to relish this blend of candied and tart flavours with both velvety and crispy textures.\n<br />Their presentation of the dessert with the wooden chopsticks, traditional soup spoon and bowl is really meticulous as well
Ba Chor Mee. These people are really creative, I\'m amazed! #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #nonentreedesserts
Sadly, taste of Horlick is not strong enough. Still prefer matcha\'s. #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #nonentreedesserts
When this BCM was served, we were almost confused that we had not taken dinner. The bowl of mango vermicelli \"noodles\" with sesame snow \"minced meat\" and coconut \"fishball\" looked absolutely real. Eating it with chopsticks could further tricked one\'s mind between what it saw and what it was actually eating. \n<br />What a brilliant twist with the updated menu to feature delicious desserts in the form of familiar local items, including toast and soft-boiled eggs, Ang gu kueh, Tu tu kueh, etc. #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #bcm #burpproved

MATCHA LAVA CAKE by Non Entrée Desserts! A matcha cake bursting with matcha lava sitting atop a crunchy almond biscuit that pours out into the bowl below that holds some cold matcha ice cream :O Do not simply indulge in merely its aesthetics though, for it tastes even better! Besides this uniquely non-entrée dessert, they also have a whole range of pretty and delicious cakes, like the La Rose (aka bandung cake in lay man\'s terms) thats in the background! #furyfoodie #sgcafe #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafoodie #rose #matcha #lavacake #letitflow #burpple

there is a creative visual effect using warm Valrhona Chocolate to flow through the Choc Cake and Almond Nougatine (the biscuit looking thing) when you use a knife to poke through. it goes onto the Chocolate \'Soil\' and melts into the Orange-Infused Vanilla Ice-Cream and when you have all types of textures mixed together, you can only go \"MmmMMmmmMmMmmm\" 😋😋😋 there is no wastage of good calories here and you can only crave to try more of their other uniquely named deserts on the menu!

Coconut crisps that melts in your mouth. The not so sweet coconut mousse, mascarpone lime sorbet and passionfruit coulis &amp; buttery crumbs were a perfect marriage. So tangy, light &amp; refreshing. Took 15mins to snap &amp; 5 mins to finish every element on the plate😋 Thank you Chef Francis for an enjoyable conversation &amp; Alex @nonentreedesserts for your hospitality &amp; great smile😃 #dessertlovers #dessert #plateddessert #cafesg #burpple #hungrygowhere #openricesg #i8mondays #igers #sgfooddiary #sgbloggers #sgfoodies #singaporeeats #chopesg #nonentreedesserts

Hope you guys enjoyed your Saturday so far!

Try their most popular rubber ducky ice cream!
.\n<br />\"漩涡中的黑洞绽放着美丽的花朵总显得而外鲜艳。\"
The frozen mango puree duckling floating on the lemongrass cloud is refreshing, toothsome and incredibly creative. \n<br />The creme fraiche pudding nestled at the base of the \'bathtub\' is smooth and creamy while the sago and biscuit scattered around the lemongrass cloud add chewiness and crunchiness to the dessert
Refreshing I would say!
😉👍🍫
My mission failed, is not able to captured the chocolate lava flowing in! Argh!! #nonentreedesserts #rangoonroad #burpplesg #burpple

Let it drip! Warm Valrhona chocolate lava flowing into chocolate soil almond nougatine &amp; orange infused vanilla ice cream! ☝️😍\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #singaporefood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instagramfood #instafood #exploresingapore

Twangy with sago pearls. Kinda like a deconstructed chinese dessert mango pearl sago with pomelo bits.  #dessertlovers #dessert #mangoes #fruitlovers #sgfoodie #burpple#opensnapeats #i8mondays #8dayseat @8days_eat #bloggerssg @nonentreedesserts
All of my favourite tropical fruits congregate together in this zingy and refreshing dessert.\n<br />If you look closer, there are actually orange petals sprinkled on the coconut mousse and their roles are  more than just a decorative sideshow. They are actually edible, bringing a tangy and bitter flavour to the toothsome dessert
A decadent dessert for white chocolate lovers!
Surrounded by white chocolate. #chocolatelovers #chocolate #dessertlovers #dessert #burpple #opensnapeats #i8mondays #8dayseat #sgfoodie #bloggerssg #teabreak
Cherry 🍒🍒 Pop..outer layer is dark choco. Cracked open ..u get earl grey jelly in mini cubes, flourless sponge and spicy cherry sorbet resting on choco soil and marinated cherry compote. The spiced sorbet hits your palate afew secs later. Compote was tangy. This would be an acquired taste cos u have different flavors bursting at the same time. For me i prefer without the spice 😄 #dessertlovers #dessert #cafesg #burpple #opensnapeats #i8mondays #8dayseat #sgfoodie #singaporefoodies @hungrygowhere @8days_eat #newcafe #singaporeinsiders\n<br />Thank you Alex, Wong and Ligen @nonentreedesserts for your warm hospitality. Looking fwd to trying out more.
Coconut Mousse, Coconut Crisps, Pineapple Chutney, Meringue, Passionfruit Coulis, Mascarpone Lime Sorbet. Seemingly plated as though there is a cheesecake, don\'t be fooled by the looks of the coconut mousse and crisps; light and smooth mousse accompanied by crunchy crisps with sweet and chunky Pineapple Chutney, tangy Passionfruit Coulis and the zingy Mascarpone Lime Sorbet which is absolutely addictive. A plated dessert which tasted as pretty as it looked, and carried its own character true to its name with its flavour and choice of ingredients. Will be back for more in the future; they seemed to have a lot of funky plated desserts which all seem worth a try!
