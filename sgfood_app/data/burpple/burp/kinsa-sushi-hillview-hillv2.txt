With fresh selection of various succulent sashimi beautifully topped on a sweet &amp; nutty purple rice, the flavour of this ‚Äòchirashizushi kappu‚Äô could also be levelled up with their special sauce ‚Äì essentially a roasted sesame ponzu dressing. Had this after finishing up their bento set, &amp; I have no shame to call this my dessert üòä\n<br />Much thanks to @KinsaSushi for hosting this.
It comes with thickly cut sashimi, a side salad, miso soup and chawanmushi. The slightly scary thing is the colour of the salmon which comes in a bright tinge of orange.
After seeing this on @sgfoodonfoot feed, I knew I had to try this. The beef was thinly cut but oh-so-fatty! üòç The soft boiled egg was also perfectly executed.
Love the ambience in this small restaurant @ HillV2. The sushis and sashimi are ok but the Wagyu Don is a must-try!
Very vibrant and pleasing to see with the combination of colours. Was not disappointed by the freshness of the sashimi. The purple rice that came along with it adds colour to the overall dish. Many thanks to @kinsasushi for hosting the chirashi cupcake giveaway! üòä #kinsasushi #sashimi #chirashicupcake

4 munchies: Crabmeat and cucumber maki topped with mentai and naturally sweet, lightly seared scallops that had a soft consistency. I liked how the al dente vinegared purple rice was delicately garnished with wasabi-seasoned prawn roe and deep fried radish that not only made the dish look pretty, but also gave it some contrast in both taste and texture.
Do you know that Kinsa Sushi has just launched their Purple Fusion menu with 10 items made from purple rice? Purple rice contains the exact benefits of brown rice and antioxidants that are beneficial for our wellbeing. We were fortunate enough to have tried the Salmon Mentai ($15.80) before the launch which was a crabmeat and cucumber maki topped with flame torched aburi salmon mentai and garnished with salmon roe. Creamy, buttery goodness with a healthy touch.
A healthier choice as you indulge in succulent slices of sashimi with purple rice. You can also drizzle a tangy dip (made of roasted sesame seed and ponzu) over the rice to bring out the flavour. This will be available as part of the Purple Fusion menu from tmr 1 Aug 2015.
4 munchies: Set to launch tomorrow, the Salmon Mentai is one of the signature items on the Purple Fusion menu that consists of a crabmeat and cucumber maki using purple rice ‚Äì topped with aburi salmon mentai and salmon roe. With the stark contrast in texture, I liked how the al dente purple rice complemented the nicely grilled aburi salmon aburi. I may prefer having my sushi in purple rice now.
The emerald roe may have stepped out of the machine during the infusion process thus bearing only the slightest of wasabi perfume, but the aburi scallop mentai ensured the maki had sufficient personality ‚Äì complete with cray-cray Einstein hairdo ‚Äì to satisfy one‚Äôs maki cravings.  3.6/5
A play on the ever-popular dessert; cupcake Kinsa Sushi presents the Chirashi Cupcake ($15.80) - a fresh selection of various sashimi on purple rice with a side of roasted sesame sauce. The thoughtful restaurant even gave each of us a separate plate, after seeing the mountain of fresh catch, so that we can mix the rice with the sauce in the cup first before transferring it to the plate and eating it together with the seafood. Please note that the Purple Fusion menu will only be launched on 1 August.
This special purple fusion menu will only be available 1st August onwards!! This low calories, high antioxidant version will be a hit for weight and health watchers. Kinsa specially imported their purple rice from Taiwan to create this healthier rendition.
To promote a healthier lifestyle, Kinsa Sushi will be launching 10 new purple rice dishes from 1 August 2015. One of the dishes we tried was the Salmon Mentai. The maki has crabmeat and cucumber filling topped with aburi salmon mentai that melts in the mouth. Decorated with salmon roe and flower petals, it is an appealing dish!
The fishy frosting performed its duties best as it could, although the squid sashimi tasted like it did not shower after a 5 \"klick\" run. Elsewhere, the purple rice tasted like a healthy cross between brown rice and pulut hitam, guaranteed to provide more bulk for your saisai (but with a topping of denbu or \"pink sugar\" to provide a girly, frisky distraction from the inevitable QQ Rice comparison). 3.6/5
5 munchies: A chic twist to chirashi don and the star dish of Kinsa Sushi\'s Purple Fusion menu, this Chirashi Cupcake sure lives up to its spectacular presentation. Served with mildly sweet and tangy sauce made from Japanese sesame dressing and ponzu, the selection of sashimi was so fresh that there was a sweet succulence to the well-cut raw seafood. I also loved the subtle roasted nutty flavour of the al dente purple rice that paired beautifully with the sashimi and dressing.
We had a sneak peek at Kinsa Sushi\'s upcoming Purple Fusion menu last night and I was intrigued with their use of purple rice (which happens to be a healthier choice) in their maki dishes. Really honored to be the first few people to have tasted their Purple Fusion menu and one of the lineup is the Hotate Mentai ($17.80), a crabmeat and cucumber maki with a slice of scallop on top and drizzled with aburi mentai. To top it all off, wasabi seasoned prawn roe and deep fried radish were added for the finishing touches. It\'s my first time trying sushi rolled this way and it\'s very refreshing knowing that purple rice was used. For health conscious people who loves sushi, this is the place to go. Please note that the Purple Fusion menu will only be launched on 1 August.
The onsen egg is served cold, so you might want to push away the beef slices from the egg, break it and let the yolk coat the rice beneath. \n<br />Aside from this delicious bowl of goodness, their sushi and other food items are great too. Shall try their set lunches the next visit.
Generous slices of wagyu beef topped with an onsen egg, priced affordably at $24.80. 
After finishing the meat, the bones are made into a broth! Exotic stuff here at #kinsasushi

Actually this kind of small portion to me compare to the pictures I see. Taste and food wise for my own preference is not really a thumb up. 
Wagyu beef don, foie gras w mushrooms and salmon belly sashimi. Got to love the freshness and quality of food here. The sashimi was fresh and sweet. The foie gras was tasty and well cooked. The wagyu beef was cooked till perfection! The best thing of all, it wasn\'t expensive for its quality!
At 24.90, the wagyu beef don is only abt 1/3 more expensive than its normal beef counterpart. But the wagyu beef was definitely the better choice. Cooked till medium rare, it almost melts in your mouth. Mix in the onsen egg and the teriyaki sauce and you get a bowl of heaven. The only negative point is that the rice was a little on the cold side. Would have been perfect if it was served hot.

It\'s finally mid-week. After a mentally exhausting week with work and whatnots, I am so glad it\'s mid-Dec already! Can\'t wait for my first winter Japan trip with baby! \n<br />Reminiscing about the aburi sushi we had over the last weekend. It was delicious but not mind-blowing, but with wallet-friendly price (S$6.80 for 2 pieces) and the proximity to our area, I think we will frequent here for our aburi fix!
Love every bite of this sushi

Thank you, Shannon (@kinsasushi), for the pleasant preview of your Purple Fusion menu tonight! Launching on 1 August, the brand new 10-item menu will consist of fusion makis that feature purple rice as the core ingredient. My picks are the Chirashi Cupcake, Salmon Mentai, Hotate Mentai, and Mango Maki.
It\'s a fusion maki sushi that makes use of a couple of shisamo fish encased with purple rice and a torched donburi cheese and miso paste. A clever idea though the miso was slightly overpowering and hopefully this will be rectified by launch time in August :)\n<br />#makisushi #shisamo #misopaste #donburi #cheese #kinsasushi #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
It is healthier with anti oxidant agents. The seafood is super fresh and naturally sweet, and coupled with a refreshing ponzu sauce, this is a winner! Avail from 1 August :)\n<br />#chirashi #chirashicupcake #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #kinsasushi #sashimi #sushi

The main reason is that it doesn\'t have that greasy feel to it! Not something very outstanding but really enjoyed it!
Not too oily but would love too see more veggie tho.
Can\'t stop munching on this until it\'s all gone! Crispy and just lightly salted, a joy to eat especially with a beer! \n<br />#japanesefood #japaneserestaurantsg #hillv2 #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #dinner  #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore  #instafood_sg #burpple #eatoutsg  #singaporeinsiders
Absolutely loved it! The egg was perfectly done and even though it is cold, it doesn\'t have that fishy raw egg taste. The #ikura really add a nice texture!
