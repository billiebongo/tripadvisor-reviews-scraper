However, this restaurant is a good deal for what it gives when considering the price range for dishes are from $5.00~, which is quite afforable, and more than anything, it is air-conditioned restaurant, not a hawker centre!
We love this restaurant\'s food very much.\n<br />The herbs are just nice, the food quantity is so generous. All in the picture is S size (except for the Pineapple friedrice is M size). And the price is reasonable.\n<br />Our must order menu is tomyum soup, BBQ pork, chicken pandan, and pineapple friedrice.\n<br />💰$38 (everything in the picture)\n<br />🚝 MRT Bencoolen/ Bugis/ Dhoby Ghout\n<br />📍Sunshine Plaza, 91 Bencoolen St #01-14/22 Singapore 189652\n<br />⏱11.30AM-3.30PM ; 5-10.15PM\n<br />Rate (5/5) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ -A MUST TRY-\n<br />#thaifood #thailandfood #tomyum #tomyumgong #tomyumsoup #seafoodtomyum #chickenpandan #bbqpork #pineapple #pineapplefriedrice #singapore #singaporefood #singaporeeats #singaporelife #singaporefoodie #singaporeculinary #nomnom #nomnomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #burpple #sgfoddies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgig
Love Thai food? Looking where to have dinner? Head to Gold Thai Food and have their Fried Kway Teow. I think Thai style fried Kway Teow is honestly the bomb. Hot, sweet and savoury, everything mixes so well together. 🍴\n<br />▫️\n<br />🔍Located near Rocher MRT, and priced at ($5) per plate. 💸\n<br />▫️\n<br />Have a great Monday evening ahead everyone!

Tender marinated pork chops barbecued and served with a special thai sauce. For just $10 bucks for a small plate that serves 2-3 pax, it\'s really worth it.\n<br />#foodie #sunshineplaza #bencoolenstreet #foodstagram #bbqpork #thaifood #mooyang #jiakpahliao #puikiajiak #burpple
Thai red curry with chicken. Got my Sunday Thai cravings solved. This dish is absolutely yummy. The curry wasn\'t that spicy and it\'s very different from the Indian version. Each slice of chicken is thickly coated with the curry and makes my plain rice taste so good! 😋😋😋\n<br />#jiakpahliao #thairedcurry #thaifood #goldfood #bencoolenstreet #sunshineplaza #foodie #foodstagram #burpple
