Chef @jonathanleewe aka #jhubby\'s favourite part of a pig, so it\'s not surprising to find it on their menu. He must be thrilled to be serving this to everyone. \n<br />Succulent confit Pork Jowl finished with a char on the grill served with Gremolata. That squeeze of lemon packs an extra punch which brings out the savouriness of the pork juices. One squeeze goes a long way 🤓
More than meets the eye, this one. \n<br />Housemade soft tofu with rich Umami-bomb Foie-Mirin sauce, Shiitake, bonito flakes and crisp ice lettuce. \n<br />Sounds relatively mediocre in writing and typically overlooked upon ordering. Yet each component had its distinctive voice and everything came together for a harmoniously finish; confirmed with approving nods all around the table.\n<br />Portion size for this dish isn\'t large, so order up! I wouldn\'t want to be sharing these. \n<br />14bucks/serve\n<br />#FTrecommends
This char-grilled tentacle had a wonderful bouncy bite to it, served with a smooth white bean purée, briny capers and fragrant browned butter.\n<br />All the way up my alley 🤤
Helmed by chef Sebastian Ng from now defunct Restaurant Ember, this dining spot in the brand new OUE Downtown fits the bill for both business and pleasure. Come by for a lunch meeting, a special meal with the colleagues, or a quiet dinner date after office hours. So far, the Burpple community has nothing but praise for the food here. Start with the Toast with Foie Gras Mousse ($12) — a decadent, silky smooth mousse that spreads perfectly. You won\'t go wrong with the Chilean Seabass, Mushroom &amp; Bacon Ragout, Truffle Yuzu Butter ($32), which Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua declares to be one of the more noteworthy dishes he\'s tasted this year; and the Grilled Octopus, Burnt Butter, Capers, Bean Purée ($27), which sees expertly grilled octopus on a burnt butter sauce. Save space for the Coffee Granite with Whipped Cream ($6), which will hit you with a potent hit of coffee, pillowed with folds of velvety whipped cream. Simple but oh so good.\n<br />Avg price: $40 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua
Take my money already! *throws wallet*\n<br />All three of us were united in praise for this seemingly simple dessert of \"Coffee Granite with Whipped Cream\" at the newly-opened \"Venue by Sebastian\". \n<br />I thought it was brilliantly executed with the granite having the ideal texture of crushed ice that\'s coarse just enough to be crunchy, not slushy. The coffee flavour was also at an intense level which we loved (so you might not want to have this with a cup of coffee unless you really crave a potent caffeine boost). Equally impressive was the fact that it wasn\'t too sweet or bitter. I realise that sounds like a weird sentence but with coffee-flavoured items, it\'s always tricky to achieve an equilibrium.\n<br />Cushioning the crystalline ice was the big dollop of decadent voluptuousness in the form of firmly-whipped cream. Make sure to get a bit of both in every spoon - it\'s your ticket to blissdom.
Skip the other desserts and just get this. It\'s super value for money and just what you need after a meal here. The coffee granite (basically crushed coffee ice) has a lovely espresso flavour that\'s not too bitter, and plays wonderfully with the velvety whipped cream that\'s hand whipped to order. Simple, but perfect.
Yes I\'m a sucker for good toast, and this was pure pleasure for me! The foie mousse was sooooo silky smooth and packed with flavour. I enjoyed spreading this decadent mousse onto the well-toasted slice of bread that was nice and salty on its own too. It was almost like enjoying the luxuriousness of foie gras without the feeling like you\'re eating lots of fat. I\'d take this version any day!
By the time this last-minute add-on order arrived at our table, I was feeling pretty full. However, after one bite, guess who was ready to plunge right in and gobble up the entire thing? Yup, this turned out to be a dish that hit all the right notes and then some!\n<br />Deeply smoky, the octopus was expertly grilled to the point where tenderness and a little bounce in the bite intersected. As juicy and naturally tasty as it was, the burnt butter sauce elevated the octopus to higher levels of satisfaction. The white bean purée and capers proved to be good complements too.
Cutlery? What\'s that? Yep, I was far too eager to sink my teeth into this wood-grilled chicken already.\n<br />Love the cumin-based chermoula marinated meat that\'s tender to the bite. The sexily smoky, slightly charred skin was more than worth the calories too.\n<br />It isn\'t a must but if you give the accompanying lemon a squeeze, the juice does give the chicken an extra spark which I think is divine.
Tiramisu in a cup.
Pan-fried Chilean Sea Bass is hands down the WINNER of VENUE bySebastian!
Checked out Venue by Sebastian at Downtown Gallery, a new casual dining spot run by Chef Sebastian Ng who used to helm now-defunct Restaurant Ember.
One of those desserts with a slight twist, the Apple \"Pie\" presents itself as a Apple Pie inspired dessert that is encased with a filo pastry esque skin. The pastry skin was crisp and flaky, while the insides reveal caramalised apple slices which were just of the right level of sweetness — the level where one knows they are enjoying a dessert yet wouldn\'t end up with a sugar rush thereafter. The Rum &amp; Raisin ice cream was also a pleasure to have — alcoholic flavours all pretty evident from the rum that pairs so well with the apple-filled pastry with its dreamy touch.
My favourite dish of the lot that I had tried at Venue by Sebastian; possibly even one of the more noteworthy dishes that I have had for the year too. 
There\'s quite a number of dishes that I wanted to go for, but settled for this eventually because I hadn\'t ordered a Duck Confit in a really long while and probably got triggered by my own temptations.
I usually skip on coffee at such places because well ... there is just something missing from the usual cup of specialty coffee from cafes. Skimming through the menu however, it is rare for such places to offer Cold Brew Coffee with Milk so I just went for it. Turns out, this was way better than what I had expected — done so well that it does exceed the standards of how some cafes execute their Cold Brew Coffee. Served unsweetened, the Cold Brew carries an evidently nutty body without being drowned in milkiness or being too bland. Pretty surprising indeed!
Twice-cooked red chimichurri marinated Lamb Riblets; braised till tender then finished with a fierce char on the grill.\n<br />Delicately chewy yet the lingering savouriness makes it increasingly addictive with every devoured riblet. There\'s no stopping till the skewer is stripped bare of each succulent morsel. \n<br />Only available during \'Bodega Hour\' between 1730-1830hrs.
Charred baby Gem Lettuce drizzled with a spicy Mentaiko vinaigrette, served alongside a fat wedge of cold creamy Burrata.\n<br />First, you\'re hit with a refreshing crisp texture, then enveloped by the Burrata\'s creamy mouthfeel and followed finally with waves of umami flavour, all in a mouthful (who would\'ve thought this combination could work 🙌🏻). Definitely a crowd pleaser!
Shiok!\n<br />🍰\n<br />Pistachio Financier, Hand squeezed Coconut Sorbet, Rasperry Yogurt, Pistachio Yogurt - the financier has a crisp exterior, and the inside is nicely moist. Totally loved the coconut sorbet, and the pistachio yogurt. Must must must try!
Here r some of the other goodies we tried...\n<br />🐙\n<br />Grilled Octopus, White Bean Puree, Capers, Burnt Butter - the smoky finish on the bouncy octopus is shiok, and the puree balances the flavors\n<br />🍕\n<br />Handcut Pappardelle Pasta, Duck Ragout, Parmigiano Reggiano - totally love the al dente texture of the pasta\n<br />🐟\n<br />Chilean Seabass, Mushroom &amp; Bacon Ragout, Truffle Yuzu Butter Sauce - interesting stack of flavors &amp; textures. The fish doesnt flake, take your time to enjoy the ensemble. Lovely\n<br />🍗\n<br />36hr Duck Confit, Truffle Emulsion, Mesclun Frisee, Lemon Mustard Vinaigrette - elaborate dish, but, i think the tastes were a tad too bold &amp; monotonous\n<br />🍟\n<br />Straight Cut Fries, Spicy Mayo - nice crisp surface, with a good bite texture on the inside. Good on its own, and the spicy mayo adds a twist to taste\n<br />🐑\n<br />Fennel Crusted Lamb Belly, Spicy Bread Crumbs, Romesco - juicy tender fatty belly, with a nice herbal fragrance. The game taste is mild, but not absent. Addictive
🍻\n<br />Beer Yuzu Uijin Blond - a light bubbly thirst quencher, refreshing citrus aroma, with a somewhat dry aftertaste.\n<br />🍹\n<br />Cocktail Fair Lady - think mojito with elderflower liqueur. Light, refreshing &amp; smooth.\n<br />🍹\n<br />COTM (Check Out These Melons) - Parma Ham &amp; Melons in a glass. Instead of salt, its crumbs of parma ham. Note: there\'s vodka in there, so, remember to stir well, and pace yourself
2 sticks just aint enough\n<br />🐠\n<br />Whitebait, Chili Salt - nice &amp; light crisp crunch familiar to that of tempura. Salty, but once u start, u cant stop\n<br />🍴\n<br />Crispy Home made Tofu, Foie Gras-mirin sauce, iced lettuce - no fancy name, jist straight up ingredients. Tofu comes with woody flavors of the sliced mushroom, blanketed with shredded dashi. Loved the combined umami flavors of the sauce.
💡\n<br />Not exactly open concept, yet, not exactly enclosed. A scene within a scene; bystanders can pause for a moment, to appreciate the dining entourage, and diners get to watch the kitchen theatrics.\n<br />📍\n<br />Located at, 6A Shenton Way 01-02, Downtown Gallery, Singapore 068815
That truffle sauce goes so well with the duck

After a long hiatus, former Ember Chef is back in action w casual dining at CBD! The restaurant adopted a tapas concept for their menu and I thought the dishes were a lil unoriginal - duck confit, hand cut pasta w ragout, angel hair w ebi, etc. Despite that, we were really pleased w our dinner that night! Every single dish was done well. Loved the Foie Gras Mousse ($12) rich, buttery, creamy (!!) and delicate hint of liver flavour. I would eat it as an ice cream 😋
Also, the best Sakura ebi angel hair pasta. Make them your hump day treat! More on www.ms-skinnyfat.com

Umami in every strand of al dente noodles. I just want to slurp them all up! Tasted 22 dishes at dinner tonight 😱😱😱. Catch some of that madness on stories!
A non-sweet dessert. The granita that packed an espresso kick. Bitter. This is fantastic for those who need a cool refreshing caffeine fix.
Simple and yet the char and the textures were so on point. I am not a huge fan of octopus but when you do it right, you\'ve got a fan in me. The grilled octopus here is served with bean puree, capers and burnt butter. Yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#octopus #fruitsofthesea #perfectchar #venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sg #oowalens

Cold pasta tossed in konbu and truffle oil, this was one of the highlights at tonight\'s dinner.

Loved how al dente the angel hair pasta was. However, I found this dish too Oriental tasting for me.

Today I had dinner with someone I have known over a decade. I hired him when he was fresh out of school and gave him a break. He has since left the firm and started his own venture. He told me today he won\'t be where he is if not because of me. I was very humbled and overwhelmed as I didn\'t expect this. A good reminder to self that all that we do leaves an impact, sometimes good and sometimes bad. We kicked off our dinner with burrata and cerise haut clos cherry tomatoes. Whilst this was good, I can\'t help but make comparisons to some of the other ones I have had elsewhere.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#reflections #impactfullives #dinnerconversations #foodforthought #appetizers #burrata #cherrytomatoes #venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #oowalens
@veronicaphua, thanks for your recommendation! This was yummy! Nice ending to my lunch today #coffeegranita #desserts #venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #shentonway #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg
Succulent and yummy! #ibericopork #gremolata #mains #venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #shentonway #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg
This came on a bed of mushrooms and bacon or pancetta. Whatever it was, it was amazingly good. As my friend says, she enjoyed the mushrooms and bacon medley as much as the fish. So yummy! #chileanseabass #mushrooms #bacon #mains #venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #shentonway #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg
We really enjoyed this too! Light and refreshing #scallops #yuzudressing #salads #appetisers #venuebysebastian #shentonway #ouedowntown #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg
They were crispy, buttery and garlicky. I will order this and one of their soups on my next visit! #burnttoast #garlictoast#venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #shentonway #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg
We ordered a few small plates and mains to share and I must say, I really enjoyed lunch today. I loved their marinated beetroot. Simple and yet so refreshing. I could taste the slight tinge of orange in it and the mint was a nice touch! #beetroot #refreshingappetisers #venuebysebastian #ouedowntown #shentonway #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg
