Every spoonful was a delight, bursting with deliciouness in the mouth. The lobsters were fresh and springy in texture, tasting lovely even after shedding their essence in the broth.

I can never get enough of the scrumptious lobster broth and the saccharine lobster..... #food #foodie #foodblog #fooddiary #foodjournal #fotd #foodstagram #foodventure #foodnation #foodporn #foodgasm #foodgram #igfood #instafood #foodpic #lobster #porridge #orchidliveseafood #thearcticstar #delicious #yummy #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burrple #foodspotting
The sweet potato leaf might have been slightly old and there were just too many onions in the baby sotong dish. The Stevens Chicken was pretty good though.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#orchidliveseafood #sembawang #lobsterporridge #tzechar  #food #foodstagram #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodgasm #foodspotting #instafood #instagood #instagramers #yummy #amazing #iphonesia #lefooding @lefooding #picoftheday #photooftheday #igdaily #sgeats #sgfood #whati8today #iweeklyfood #eatoutsg #burpple
