So many layers! Like the mayo on top of the scramble eggs!
Grilled ham and cheese, with scrambled eggs and avocado. Love this place for the generous servings. 
But what make this dish from Craftsmen Specialty Coffee is the spicy chipotle mayo! 😘
Topped with a knob of salted butter, drizzle of maple syrup, and sprinkling of icing sugar, this Timeless Waffles ($9) is an absolute classic. Craftsmen nailed the crispy-fluffy texture, and this is easily one of the best waffles imho. Love that the simple toppings allowed the great waffle to shine.
Let\'s welcome the weekend with a 3 tier brioche egg benedict!
Popcorn Caramel cake. It was okay for a first few bites but after awhile, it\'s just too sweet. Happy #TGIF everyone!
Iced expresso. In cubes. Just pour the milk in and.... HOALA! The ice-cold creamy sensation flirted with my tongue which gave it a swirl and let it lingered for a while, before releasing it to the depths of my bottomless pit. It\'s gonna be my favourite drink from now!
- The 3 Tier Brioche with shaved ham, cheddar making up 3 layers along with fresh avocado and greens on the side. Chose those fluffy scrambled eggs over poached ones to top my stack. Really love their homemade hollandaise sauce with a slight spiciness, making the whole thing less gelat. Of course, my accompanying latte was pretty good. \n<br />The new outlet by craftsmen speciality coffee happens to be near my tuition place, I can now drop by conveniently for my caffine fix. Easily spotted just next to cold storage. I\'ll be back for the churros! 😊
Waffles with salted caramel ice cream, driZzled with salted gula Melaka sauce and sprinkled with berries and almond. A little too sweet for my liking. Ended up pushing the caramel aside coz I didn\'t really like the ice cream 
it\'s been awhile since coming here and it\'s a nice quiet spot to spend on my own with my ipad on a Sunday morning... good and simple bf and a good coffee is the best way to start off a Sunday and the coming week.. #gettingfatwhilewaiting #burpple #whilewaitingfortheloml #lomljnck #lomljns #canoneosm10
Came back to old house to clear ALL the stuff! It\'s all gonna be good from now on 😀
Pleasant surprise on tastebuds. Every mouthful is so flavourful.
I\'m gonna miss the convenience of having @craftsmenspecialtycoffee cafe at my \'doorstep\' so so much.\n<br />🎀\n<br />#cappuccino #newyear #sgbrunch #sgbreakfast #latteart #coffeeart #sgcoffee #coffeegram #sgcafefood #burpple #cafehoppingsg #stfoodtrending #cakeporn #sgeats #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #singaporeinsiders #stfood #burpple #coffeeporn #brunch #cafe #sgcafe #sgfood

Waffles are so fluffeh haha and I really love the tomato salsa that was fresh, tangy and sweet! #burpple #sgcafefood #eatoutsg #8dayseat
Today we decided to go back to Craftsmen Speciality Coffee to try the breakfast they offer. I had the Savoury Waffles ($17.90) which consisted of Buttermilk Waffles, salsa, scrambled eggs with signature sauce, &amp; a choice of either grilled back bacon or smoked salmon, and of course, my all-time favourite Hot Chocolate ($6).
Love the crunchiness of the almond nuts that was added to it but somehow just felt that the sourish strawberries didn\'t really complemented well with the waffle.
... OMG, it has two of my favorite ingredients, dark chocolate and walnuts!!! 😍😘 I need to make a trip there soon! 🍴\n<br />Craftsmen\'s mid-week special - \n<br />Dark Chocolate Speculoos Walnut cake! \n<br />Available at both Siglap and Eastwood outlets!
Warm Churros in old sch vanilla ice cream.Yumz!
Lovely latte to acoompany my brunch!

Ice Expresso with fresh milk. Our number one choice for coffee and brunch!
Still, we indulge ourselves in this glass of pure goodness - cold fresh milk raining on expresso ice cubes. Feeling recharged, we gleefully make our way to Suntec Exhibition Hall. #aquarama
Always my first choice for a good meal!

Tulip latte art 😃
I held the glass cup and was surprised it was chilled. Picked a churro. It was warm and I took a bite. Instantly, I was pleasantly shocked. The cinnamon sugar-coated, light and fluffy stick laced with chocolate sauce and dipped in vanilla ice-cream burst into a myraid of candied flavours under my crunch that made me feel like I had transposed back in time to a toddler having fun at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Didn\'t feel like having cake as well as it was too heavy for my state. So I ordered churros. I held the glass cup and was surprised it was chilled. Picked a churro. It was warm and I took a bite. I was pleasantly shocked. The cinnamon sugar-coated, light and fluffy stick laced with chocolate sauce and dipped in vanilla ice-cream burst into a myraid of candied flavours under my crunch that made me feel like I had transposed back in time to a toddler having fun at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. My headache is now gone and my inspiration is back.

My Tuesday with love. 😻
The drizzle of gula melaka syrup made it so pretty to look at and so delightful to have. One of my fav from Craftsmen. 😋😋😋
