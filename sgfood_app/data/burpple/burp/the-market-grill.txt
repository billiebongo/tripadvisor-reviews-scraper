Go straight for the Mussel Bisque. It looks simple and homely, but that full-flavored homemade crustacean bisque, made complex with brandy, wine, garlic and a touch of chilli, is worth rolling up your sleeves for and slurping down to the last drop. #MediaTasting
Minutes ago, the lobster stuffed to overflowing in my toasted brioche roll was hanging out with its buddies in the tank behind 😳 Luckily it tasted good enough to keep me distracted from this rather disturbing thought 😋 I must admit I was curious though as to why there\'s a need for that single leaf of lettuce I found tucked at the bottom of everything 🤔 I did truly appreciate the competently done sides of crispy, salty golden fries and simple salad of mixed greens though. They did the job of turning my Lobster Roll into a meal 😄
Best fish burger alive - must be those mustard kissed soft as pillow toasted buns, succulent chunk of cod and a tasty side of salad and fries. Who needs beef when this cod rules? #foodporn #burpple #unlistedcollectionsg #unlistedcollection #unlistedchefs #marketgrillsg
The hefty chunks of portobello loaded in this beef burger make it seem twice as meaty! With the milky-creamy sauce used to sauté the mushrooms as the delicious glue to keep all the good stuff in there together, crisp bacon included, this is another burger that gets two thumbs up from me.
Everything about the CW Burger Breakfast just hit the mark for me. The soft, fluffy sesame seed-studded bun was perfectly buttered and toasted while the handmade beef patty cooked medium-rare, was supremely juicy and tender. I chose the 150gms option for the patty ($24++) today but will unreservedly, zero in on the 200gms one ($33++) the next time I\'m here because the beef was beautifully seasoned and done to perfection. Melted aged cheddar, crispy bacon and a glorious sunny-side-up egg completed this far-from-complicated but oh-so-fabulous burger.\n<br />Highly recommended. 
This casual-chic joint in Telok Ayer is known for its grilled steaks and lobsters, but here\'s what we are returning for — the CW Cod Fish ($28), which sees Pommery-marinated Atlantic cod and lemony herbed mayo sandwiched in a Parmesan bun. Don\'t be deceived by the burger\'s unassuming appearance — every element was spot on. We love the tang of the mustard, which brought out the super firm yet moist and perfectly grilled fish, and the bun was nice and soft. The burger is served with fries and salad, both of which are perfunctory but not fabulous. You may want to order the Sarladaise Potatoes (roasted with skin on, $8) on the side. The Market Grill\'s location near the CBD makes it perfect for an after-work date night; we give it bonus points for waiving service charge!\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayne Tan
A little pricey, but OMG so good. Never had cod this well cooked, and paired so nicely with tangy mustard slathered on the top bun and a lemon-herb mayo. The Parmesan buns are soft and substantial, holding the firm, buttery Atlantic cod very well. The fries and salad on the side are just fine. I would definitely come back to have this burger as a treat, probably for date night since the place has cosy warm lighting and friendly service.
This isn\'t a dish for those on healthy food or such, this is a pure foodgasm at its climax - medium pinkish properly done, juicy melt in mouth fat, succulent meat and best part is crispy chargrilled exterior - matched with red wine jus, potatoes saladaise, rocket salad. Comes with a price sgd 68 n for 600grams? Quality does come with a price but hey...for that price, u got good deal. 
This was my first time trying The Market Grill so my friend and I decided to get a 1.1kg U.S Prime Rib accompanied by caramelised onions, potato saladaise and red wine jus to share. Having heard so many people raving about having good steaks at The Market Grill, I think I was sorely disappointed with the meal I had. The Prime Rib was really dry throughout. I had to eat all pieces of the steak with red wine jus otherwise it would\'ve been bland and tasteless. Maybe my friend and I were just unlucky that day or maybe The Market Grill isn\'t good with bigger cuts of meat. 
Let\'s just say it\'s about time they should close the shop. I went last Sat at 8:30pm, I was told it was their last order and only 3 items available. So we left to MeatSmith instead. Today, I went again thinking to celebrate my best friend\'s birthday there. One of my friend got there first, she asked if can put tables together, the waitress said no. She said they only have items that\'s on the board. I came in with a birthday cake, she said no outside food allowed. If you do sell cakes fine, I totally understand, well it\'s not the case here. After my friend explained to me they only have food that available on the board I questioned the lady, what\'s happening to this restaurant? She said junior chef cannot cope (fyi only 3 tables occupied) and executive chef on leave. So I asked for how long? In her unfriendly and sarcastic tone, you can check Facebook! Seriously I\'m totally WTH?! As much I love the food here, I\'ve been rejected two days, so guys if you wanna go there, make sure it\'s when the EXECUTIVE CHEF is BACK! 😪 #instafood #burpple #restaurantsg
Indulging in a whole lobster for dinner sounds like a great idea isn\'t it? It is served with a classic garlic butter, mash &amp; salad. The lobster meat was full of sweetness, though a tad chewy for me! This made me miss Burger &amp; Lobster in London but The Market Grill is not too bad an alternative we have on our sunny island! 
Airflown Maine Lobsters served after its gotten some good char on the grill, with garlic butter sauce and a side each of mash and greens. \n<br />Freshness is truly the bestest, this simple way of cooking exhibits the springy lobster\'s flesh, natural sweetness and flavour. Don\'t forget to grab yourselves a glass of wine too! Delish!!
Deliciously fatty, topped with caramelized onions, and a flavorful red wine jus. The mashed potatoes are the bomb as well!! I\'ve got nothing but praise for this dish 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Grilled whole Maine Lobster, with butter sauce and salad. Cooked right and fresh. A pure shellfish indulgence 👍👍👍👍👍
The server indicated that the oysters just arrived yesterday which means, delicious fresh oysters, and she was right! I prefer to have vinegrette and shallot dressing. Wash it down with Marlborough\'s Sauvignon Blanc. Heavenly! 
Gobsmackingly delicious. Haven\'t had good lobster rolls yet, so I was surprised at how well made this was. Huge - I mean HUGE - chunks of fresh, sweet, juicy lobster meat from a 500g lobster, lightly tossed in mayo and chives, served in a toasted, buttery brioche. Can\'t tell you how awesome it felt ripping those lobster meat apart.
Some claimed it\'s one of the best in Singapore, 500g of lobster meat, with light mayo sauce, tucked inside soft brioche, served with french fries and garden salad. Delicious! 
Other than the lobster roll and burgers, there\'s also crispy pig ears. Gasp. Www.ms-skinnyfat.com
Dark rum infused caramelized bananas in a crispy pastry! Yum yum.
Been craving for some lobster roll and finally satisfied it at The Market Grill!
.
Salty Bleu cheese, Sweet burnt onion marmalade, bacon atop a mouthwatering beef patty. Try resisting that. For me the Bleu cheese, bacon and grilled onion was gourmet calibre but the beef patty is not better than some others I have in mind. However what was worth mentioning is the walnut raisin buns that held all these goodness together. It is firm enough so you don\'t end up eating beef patty from your hands!
My partner keeps getting my imagination going when she exclaimed how large and fleshy these frog legs are. The garlic &amp; herb butter was aromatic and gave the robust flavours to the nicely grilled frog legs. The flesh is succulent and resembles kampung chicken thigh. Not for the faint hearted though.
The name is a little cheesy for this down to earth rocket salad in balsamic shallot dressing. The Wagyu rump is slow cooked for 4hours and sliced, which unfortunately is lacking in flavour for me. The pickled sweet onion was the life saver for me in this visually pleasing/ teasing appetizer.
Comforting on your palate and tummy especially after a \"gelat\" dinner. Let it go...
Literally live from the tank and grilled. Goes well with the subtle garlic butter sauce too.
Too little meat and slightly powdery, which was disappointing. The mash was fantastic though, very buttery and smooth.
The cod was fresh and well-seasoned but the meat:burger bun ratio was too low. Also, the tomato and lettuce layer was dressed in a tasty but strong-flavoured sauce that overpowered that of the cod :(
The Market Grill features charbroiled steaks, live Atlantic Lobsters as well as Colin West’s (CW) Signature handcrafted Burgers that are hearty and robust. Here\'s a photo of  CW Cod Fish Burger. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/a-guide-to-restaurants-eateries-near-downtown-line-1/
Nice presentation and fresh, however only modest amount of ham so a bit over-priced. 
I love The Market Grill\'s CW Cod Fish! :)
Juicy beef with bacon! I\'m not a burger person but it was so good. No regrets. 
Didn\'t have the bbq charcoal grill taste but was still good and tasty. The potato salad was smooth and buttery! Thumbs up! 
Mad succulent grilled Atlantic Cod sandwiched between fluffy baked Parmesan buns. I don\'t usually like fish burgers but boy, this one\'s pretty damn awesome!
One whole live lobster is used to prepare this a la minute. After poaching, the lobster is shelled before tossing the sweet succulent meat with a Dijon-kissed mayonnaise and finally stuffing into fluffy pan-fried buns. SO BLOODY GOOOD!!!
The swordfish was tender and juicy, well complemented by the zesty cubed mango sauce. Together with the fries and salad, it was a very satisfying main 😋 ($26++)\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple #hungrygowhere #whati8today #exploresingapore #foodiesg #8dayseat #sgfoodie #iweeklyfood #foodstagram #foodporn #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #foodphotography #themarketgrill @themarketgrillsg #burger #swordfish
So good that we asked for bowls and more toast to finish up the bisque.. A definite must order
My favourite lobster roll without the fries. 🙂

Fleshy chunks of a whole Maine Lobster (500g) lightly dressed in The Market Grill’s housemade Herb Mayonnaise then stuffed to the overflowing brim of a grilled brioche bun. \n<br />Freshness gives you the luxury of minimal additions to the plate; you don’t need sixteen other components for a lobster dish to impress. This good old Lobster Roll seals the deal, exuding natural sweetness with every chunk.\n<br />Lobster lovers, get in line!
Good with the provided dipping sauce, better on its own, Best with alcohol. Crispy, salty and addictive. Can’t find any better beer bites than this. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />The price is a tad too steep for the size, but if you have enough cash to burn then do it. Or just pop by and get this ultimate munchie, but good luck resisting the lobster roll and meat platters especially when it’s on almost every table. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #themarketgrillsg #unlistedcollection #crispy #pigsears #chips #munchie #meatshow #crispypigsears
Pair the tender Angus Short Rib with their Caramelized Onion &amp; Bacon Jam and Chili paste which sees the dish transcend into another level of deliciousness because everything is just better with bacon. 🥓\n<br />.\n<br />There are some hidden meat and fats left at the side of the bone, so throw away your table manners and maul on that glorious piece of beef heaven, use your hands and just go all out for it. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #themarketgrillsg #unlistedcollection #meatshow #blackangus #angusbeef #shortrib #caramelisedonion #bacon #jam #beef
Crispy deep fried chicken topped with roasted bell pepper, anchovy, capers, garlic &amp; chipotle aioli sandwiched in a sesame seed bun. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />The fried chicken thigh is massive, almost twice the size of the bun. Crispy skin, moist and juicy thigh meat. Better than any of Colonel’s thigh.

With sides like; Babaganoush, Home Cured Item, Pulled Pork Mac &amp; Cheese, Grilled Seasonal Vegs &amp; Sourdough. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />Both the Bavette &amp; Secreto Pork are Grilled and Seasoned to perfection but what outshines then is the Sakura Chicken which is brined for hours, Seasoned well and grilled masterfully. Normally Chicken is boring to me, but the bird here is moist, tender and bursting with flavours. 🍗\n<br />.\n<br />I’m always up for mysterious meat in tubed form, however the Pork Sausage has a tad too much spices that masked the flavour of the Pork. Nonetheless, a feast for all the carnivores out there. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #themarketgrillsg #unlistedcollection #meatshow #meatplatter #sausage #bavette #flanksteak #pork #chicken #pulledpork #secreto #carnivore
🌊\n<br />.\n<br />Swordfish normally has an acquired fishy taste but paired with the mango salsa helps to reduce &amp; balance the overall taste. However, the swordfish still has the strong fishy taste and if you don’t take sashimi or any silver fish like mackerel then skip this. Salmon may fare better. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #themarketgrillsg #unlistedcollection #swordfish #burger #mangosalsa #fries #salad
Served with salad &amp; Fries. I like how the lobster meat wasn’t heavily seasoned with mayo, allowing the natural sweetness of the lobster to shine through. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />An entire lobster was used in this roll. It will be perfect if the Toasted Brioche bun can be a little more buttery throughout. The Market Grill uses Live Atlantic Lobsters flown in from Maine &amp; Boston hence the slightly Hefty Price Tag. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the Invitation &amp; @themarketgrillsg @unlistedc for Hosting us!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #themarketgrillsg #unlistedcollection #lobsterroll #lobster #roll #brioche #salad #fries

For this tasting, we were treated to one of their new launches which include the Meat Platter ($148), a gigantic tray of grilled goodness, fit for 3-4 pax, which is sure to satisfy all the carnivores on the table. If you think that my favourite would be the beef steak, you will be blown away by the grilled sakura chicken; which airborne into our local shores from overseas, got marinated and grilled with their in-house spices. The resulting end product is a tender and juicy piece of meat, even down to the breast meat. The platter also consists of grilled vegetables, 500g of monster sausages, flank steak, pork and sides of babganoush, duck rillette, pulled pork mac &amp; cheese and sour dough bread.\n<br />_________________\n<br />The Market Grill\n<br />Address: 208, Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068642\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #restaurantsg #TheMarketGrillSG
