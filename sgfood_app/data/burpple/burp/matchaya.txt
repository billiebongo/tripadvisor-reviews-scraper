Dusted with what seemed like icing sugar, the snowflakes imparted a Christmas alike theme that is suited for the approaching seasons of giving ❄️. The darker version of Nama choc unfortunately had no significant difference to the original version IMO. However I still enjoyed the luscious, bittersweet chocolatey flavour and the creamy, thick texture of the softserve 💖. It was still a rich, intense and chocolatey one that had a lingering bittersweet flavour. Though I wouldn’t mind for a higher intensity definitely 😝. [PS: only available at the Icon village outlet].\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
[Available only at Icon Village til 3rd Dec] After a couple of spoonfuls and then some, I finally understood why those vocal about their love for the this seasonal softserve from Matchaya have been unwavering in declaring this as ‘underrated’. The distinguishable smoky aftertaste of the Genmaicha Parfait takes its time in lingering on the palette. It’s one flavour that will put off the people who view desserts merely as a narrow catacomb of sweetness instead of a open plain where a plethora of flavours exist in harmony. And rightfully so.
The latest and perhaps one of the last #autumninmatchaya flavours (at least for the year), the cheery yellow swirls were amazeballs. Combining sweet Japanese Pumpkin (Kabocha) with mitarashi sauce and crunchy pumpkin seeds; the salty-sweet seasonal pairing is the best one yet (but of course I am biased since I adore pumpkin). So guuud! With just a drizzle of their potent mitarashi sauce, the house-made sauce really brought out the light and delicate nuttiness. Yums, can’t wait for it to be back and as always looking forward to the winter seasonal flavours!
So, I’m…disappointed that I missed out on Matchaya’s two previous seasonal flavours – Mitarashi and Kyoho Grape – which were both quite redefining to the business, buttttt never mind that now. I did, however, get to try their current seasonal flavour, Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin)! 😛🎃
The first fruit based flavour that was launched recently at @matchayasg , this was an ultimate limited edition flavour available for only a few days (yesterday was the last day unfortunately 😢). Glad to be able to rush down in time to try it yesterday before it was replaced with another new mystery flavour! 🙏🏻 No regrets as usual, with the softserve bearing a pleasant tinge of fruity sweetness of Kyoho grapes that was refreshing as well! Texture was also smooth, creamy and light - less dense than the usual tea flavours. It’s a great pity that the Brie cheese wasn’t available anymore when I went, was so looking forward to this unique combination of 🧀 +🍦... 😭 Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the softserve which was naturally and subtly sweet and refreshing to the palate! 💖 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
This Kyoho Grape Softserve ($8.50 with aburi shiratama) is evidence that your food dreams can come true...for me at least, bahahaha.
This month’s mystery flavour is Kyoho Grape. That’s right, it’s the Japan grapes that will usually come with an expensive price tag, and Matchaya still decided to share it with their fans.
I must admit feeling a little confused first seeing this, like am I supposed to eat them together? One after another? But when you think about it it kinda makes sense. We’ve been pairing grapes with cheese all along, be it as wine with cheese or a regular fruit and cheese platter; so this isn’t really all that strange. The soft serve on its own was smooth as usual, though perhaps a tad too sweet for some and highly reminiscent of our childhood QOO drink. Definitely would recommend having a little bit of that nutty brie in each bite to balance it all!
🍡 Torched and flamed to a caramelised burnt exterior, the dango balls were a complementary pairing to the soy sauce based softserve, with its characteristic chewy, mochi texture and a subtle caramelised burnt flavour. The mitarashi softserve bears a striking resemblance to salted caramel, with a pleasant lingering saltiness which I personally would have preferred to be more intense. Saltiness &gt; sweetness anytime for me😋! The addition of the kuromitsu sauce could have been omitted though as the sweetness got a tad overwhelming after awhile. If only there’s mitarashi sauce instead the combination would have been perfect! 🤤💖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Let’s just start off a “wowza”! Matchaya has done it again, and this time it is with their seasonal Mitarashi Softserve ($8). With an intriguing savoury fragrance churned into the sweet creamy swirls, the ice cream really reminded me of a light and more delicate salted caramel or more specifically soy caramel. And you have to couple that with their aburi Dango shiratama which was all warm, bouncy, chewy but not too sticky. One big spoon of ice cream; one bite of gooey, soft dango. Loving that the addictive yet familar burnt aroma of the viscous shiny sweet soy-sauce glaze was subtly woven throughout the dessert... utterly satisfying without being overly sweet!
The aburi-ed dango with kuromitsu sauce was perfect, I only wish it was drizzled with mitarashi sauce (sweet soy sauce) too! \n<br />The flavour of the mitarashi soft serve has been calibrated so that it can be accepted by most, but I do wish it was more on the savoury side 😉 Still, it warrants more than one try! $8 for the parfait (more soft serve, the better to share with!) that comes with dango.
Newly launched today, I had no regrets making a special trip down just to get my hands on this flavour. In case you are wondering, mitarashi is made from shoyu ; yes that’s right- SOY SAUCE! 🍶 Usually found as a sauce drizzled  on dango balls, it’s now churned into a softserve, made using a premium grade Shoyu aged for 10 years sourced specially from Akita in Japan by @matchayasg 💚. Limited portions available! Just like many out there, the thoughts of “soy sauce” 酱油 in a softserve resulted in some initial doubts and qualms that I decided to play safe and opted for mixed flavour (just in case savoury softserve aren’t my cup of tea 🍵 ). However, just one mouth was all I took to be get me sold! 💖 Bearing a smooth, creamy and melt-in-the mouth texture, the subtle savoury umami flavour of shoyu was accompanied with a lingering caramelised, burnt fragrance that leggit resembled salted caramel- a perfect combination that worked wonders to my palate and made me instantly regretted not having it as a single flavour instead! The kinako kuromitsu parfait (mixed flavour) comes with a base of toasted rice puffs drizzled with kuromitsu sauce  which lended a pleasant crunch factor, azuki beans (which I requested to be omitted), topped with jelly-like chewy warabi mochi, shiratama (the renowned partner-in-crime to mitarashi🍦), dustings of kinako powder that added a lingering roasted flavour and fragrance. Last but not least, the default Langue de chat biscuit that’s always so match-a necessity (for me at least 🙈). The matcha  softserve, as usual bears a distinctive, lingering earthy flavour with a characteristic bitter undertone which overwhelmed the weaker mitarashi flavour. So gonna get a solo mitarashi on my next visit!!! Please let it be available till next week at least 🙏🏻🙏🏻 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Kinako Kuromitsu ($9.90)\n<br />.\n<br />The wow is neither the kinako nor the kiromitsu but this autumn season’s special flavour, Japanese maple made from 10yr old premium grade shoyu aka Mitarashi! Wow @matchayasg ! This was a real surprise and my virgin experience with shoyu in softserve form and I’m loving it! The mitarashi softserve is akin to the more familiar salted caramel but more subtle. This was also my first time having it in a parfait and the softserve together with azuki beans, rice puffs, shiratama, warabi mochi, kinako powder and kuromitsu drizzle worked perfectly!
Oh Matchaya... Why do you do this to me! I thought Kuri was my favourite, but now I\'ve fallen in love with another... 😘
I hauled ass to @matchayasg once I saw the latest “mystery flavour” revealed on their IG Story. You have to admit, there is something very appealing about the sound of a “Japanese Maple” soft serve, right? 😋 Anyway, this is one of the #AutumnInMatchaya flavours that’s being rolled out during this season 🍂🍁\n<br />I am convinced I made the best decision when I chose to have the mostly sweet, slightly savoury soft serve, in a parfait ($9.90). Reminiscent of sea-salt caramel ice-cream, albeit a subtler version, I found it tasted especially good with the soft warabi mochi, chewy shiratama, crunchy rice puffs, not-too-sweet but rich azuki and crisp langues de chat cookie. Each one seemed to bring out slightly different nuances in the Japanese Maple. And just to clarify, this isn’t a ready-made flavouring but one that’s concocted in-house from mirin, shoyu, water and sugar.
Still prefer cup over cone but Matchaya\'s Hokkaido Milk Serve (Cone - $6.50) is still one of the best softserves I\'ll ever taste on this sunny island.
It’s the SOP to get the matcha flavour every time I’m here. But the Black Sesame surprisingly won this time round!
Hmm, I thought all along there’s already this option in their regular menu? But nonetheless this is the standard that all Houjicha soft serve should inspire to be; creamy consistency with a bittersweet flavour. At the same time, being a heat-beater to combat the ever presence of the humid weather.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />Address: 12, Gopeng Street, Icon Village, Unit 01-72, Singapore 078877\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #matchaya #matchayasg
Latest seasonal flavour from Matchaya - chestnut softserve to celebrate the arrival of autumn. There\'s bits of chestnut and a leaf-shaped cookie, and cone has a surprise hidden within 😊 I shall not spoil it for you, but remember to finish eating the whole thing 😊\n<br />🔸\n<br />Taken on iPhone 8 Plus 
For the last bite, you\'ll get a surprise too as the bottom of the cone has rich chestnut paste!\n<br />•\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />Address: 12 Gopeng Street, #01-72, Icon Village, Singapore 078877\n<br />#matchayasg
Chestnut Softserve Cone ($7.50)\n<br />.\n<br />Wow @matchayasg ! Awesomness in a cone 🍦. Aesthetically pleasing and tastefully balanced. No rum-soaked marron bits this year but hey, overall just as good! Dense kuri softserve adorned with sweet chestnut bits providing an extra textural experience and decorated with a buttery autumn leaf cookie. Just when you think the fun stops there, you are met with a rich chestnut paste at the bottom of the cone to deliver that final knockout punch!
Mystery flavour to kick start Autumn at Matchaya, is Chestnut! Texture\'s the usual smooth and creamy (done well as always) but it was leaning abit more on the sweet end for me. Was kinda hoping for a more distinct chestnut flavour!
Thanks @matchayasg for kindly accommodating to my request at no additional cost ☺️. Mystery flavour that\'s available for now would be kinako kuromitsu (till 17 sept). The ice blended beverage had a distinctive, roasted flavour and lingering aroma of kinako, with kuromitsu syrup blending in harmoniously with its pleasant tinge of natural sweetness. On the downside, I didn\'t quite enjoy the texture of the beverage that consisted of shards of ice crystals, resulting in a coarse and gritty mouthfeel to a supposedly thick, creamy beverage. Nevertheless, the softserve compensated for my slight disappointment, being as enjoyable and awesome as always! 💚 The kinako kuromitsu softserve leaned towards a sweeter profile, with a subtle roasted flavour whereas the matcha, as usual, bears a characteristic earthy note and a bitter undertone .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
A tiramisu inspired dessert, this parfait is a tad different from the usual softserve layered with toppings, but comes with ladyfinger biscuit (unsoaked) served with fluffy kuromitsu espuma to retain a pleasant crunch factor. Swipe to view the different elements that comprised this seasonal parfait. Dusted with kinako powder (in replacement of coco powder in tiramisu), the espuma is foamy, soft and cotton-like that that complemented well with the crunchy and crisp ladyfinger biscuit. Would personally prefer if the ladyfinger biscuits are soaked in rum though, for a more tiramisu inspired feel 😂. The kinako kuromitsu softserve was smooth, creamy with a distinct characteristic roasted flavour that was milder with the incorporation of kuromitsu (black sugar honey). Neverthless, it still carries off a subtle lingering roasted aroma coupled with a pleasant tinge of sweetness from kuromitsu. Wished there was more softserve too! 😅 With a base of chewy albeit firm brown sugar tea jelly, the combination of the different elements managed to achieve a complementary, satisfactory factor to the palate but unfortunately as satisfying for the visuals 🙈 .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
That\'s right, ya boi finally paid a pilgrimage to Matchaya and sampled their goodies. Now, I have been enlightened as to why everybody has been losing their collective heads over this little dessert kiosk.
Think an older, roastier and more thoughtful and mature matcha, with the two soft genmaicha warabi mochi having the saggy wobble of a pair of — (that\'s quite enough - Moral Education Editor). 3.9/5
Green tea with roasted brown rice flavored, tea taste strong (S$5.90).
Genmaicha x Matcha 🍵🍦soft serve\n<br />Roasty brown rice like none before 🍵🍚\n<br />A lil too rich but the distinct bitterness matcha helps with the dense-ness;\n<br />Other than that, pure indulgence 💚\n<br />Thank you for the treat @yukithesnowman ✌🏼🙂
Genmaicha is one of my (many) favourite flavour from Matchaya! Although not as strong as houjicha, the light roasty flavour with a hint of nuttiness is  very much appreciated. 
Comprising of a base layer of salted cookie crumbs (surprisingly my favourite element here), topped with kuromitsu espuma (which I requested for less), genmaicha softserve, genmaicha warabi mochi and sprinkled with a little buckwheat rice puffs. The genmaicha softserve is thick and creamy with a lingering roasted aroma coupled with a subtle earthy note. Flavour was less intense and robust as compared to the matcha and houjicha flavours but still distinctive. The salted cookie crumbs were what I enjoyed most, a pleasant crunch factor coupled with a pleasant mild lingering saltiness that provides a great counter balance to the sweetness of the light and fluffy kuromitsu espuma. The genmaicha warabi mochi is firm albeit chewy, coated with genmaicha powder that came with a distinct and robust roasted, earthy flavour and aroma. Though I would have personally preferred for a stronger genmaicha flavour, the different elements constituting this parfait was a winning combination that I truly enjoyed! 💖💚\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smittenchoice #smitteneats
If you have not tried the Genmaicha Parfait, I suggest you scurry on over asap because it won\'t be around beyond this Sunday (2nd Sept), if not sooner.\n<br />My order, pictured above, appears bigger and greener than what this parfait normally looks like because I had topped on Matchaya\'s signature matcha soft serve. The genmaicha flavour is the lighter green one squashed in the cup. I loved having both at the same time as it allowed me to taste and appreciate the difference better. In comparison to the slightly bitter matcha, the genmaicha has a toasted aroma and a gentle sweetness. So it would sit well with those of you who find matcha too intense for your liking.\n<br />What\'s more, the list of other yumminess in this parfait is long. There\'s genmaicha warabi mochi, crispy genmai rice, Okinawa kuromitsu in foam and syrup form, and last but not least, salted cookie crumbs. \n<br />I think I just convinced myself to make a trip down for another one of these before stock runs out.
It won\'t be fair for me to rate this and I\'m not going to say why, but it\'s a simple guess. 😬 So, I\'m making this post with the pure intention of sharing.
With my belly blissfully full with a bagelwich from nearby Two Men Bagel House, I walked past Matchaya. For some reason, although the blinds of the shop were down signalling it\'s not yet open, I felt compelled to stop and take a peek to check. Just my luck that the co-owner Kevin was in there getting ready to open at 12noon. And guess what? It was 11.58am at that point - hooray! *happy dance*\n<br />I ordered their ever-famous Matcha and the day\'s \"mystery flavour\" of Nama Chocolate soft serve. The temptation to add on Kinako Warabi Mochi was too strong - so I caved.\n<br />What more can I say about Matchaya\'s creation that hasn\'t been said so eloquently by so many before?\n<br />Both soft serves were very smooth, creamy and deeply saturated in their respective flavours. I liked that the Matcha didn\'t have any bitterness, and the Nama Chocolate with its 75% dark chocolate ingredient, had sweetness dialed nice and low. Those big cubes of Mochi were excellent as well - I simply love how super soft they were.
💚 Available at both outlets that\'s applicable to any flavours, I managed to satisfy my weekly matcha fix with matcha and houjicha softserve at the Icon village outlet. My ultimate favourite matcha softserve in Singapore till date, with a robust and lingering pleasant earthy note. Also I fancy the smooth, thick and creamy texture that allowed prolonged enjoyment. I personally prefer the houjicha flavour that came with a distinct and impactful roasted flavour and aroma that was lingering with a characteristic bitter undertone. The best place to satisfy your matcha cravings with a consistent standard and quality that\'s impressive and never fails to disappoint! 💖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Essentially a strawberry jam-drizzled walk down the lobby of a swanky 5-star hotel, with the shiratama offering Jennifer Lopez-esque bounce. 3.8/5
Pretty purple with a rather delicate lavender aroma, milky and smooth as usual tho slightly on the sweeter side. Just read that tomorrow\'s gonna be the last day for this Lavender soft serve so do head down before it\'s gone if floral flavours are your thing; personally enjoyed this quite a fair bit! 
The raspberry sauce was rly the absolute bombs. Last day today I think!
Mystery flavour only available at Icon village outlet. Apparently, the flavours have yet to be repeated 😛 
A pretty decent matcha cream roll, but it lacks anything truly outstanding that warrants a mention or two. I did like the bread though, as it soaked up in my mouth almost immediately, which paved the way for a semi-melty sensation. Ultimately, if you ask me, you\'d need at least two of it to actually feel some satisfaction from this. 🤔 (7/10)
Having tried this lilac floral flavour in silo on my prior visit, I decided to make a return trip for a dual flavour and also for the newly launched lavender macaroon (limited stocks available). The combination was not only a pleasant experience for the sight, but my palate was greatly satisfied as well. The earthy matcha flavour coupled with its characteristic bitter undertone surprisingly blended in harmoniously with the aromatic floral fragrance of lavender 💚💜. The lavender macaroon had a crisp meringue exterior with a lavender infused buttercream filling- smooth and creamy with a subtle floral fragrance that could have been more distinct. Looking forward to the next mystery flavour as always! 💖💖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Went down to Matchaya\'s original outlet yesterday to have a go at their mystery flavour, which happens to be none other than…Lavender! 😋
Lavender soft serve?! Can I get a HOOYA?! Like all other Matchaya desserts, I was left speechless at how well-infused with lavender this ice cream was, and more importantly, how good this tastes! Finally pretty food can taste good too! They have also started serving in cones, but the only downside is that they turn pretty soggy quite fast. Do note the lavender is only a special flavour that lasts for a limited time at the Icon Village Outlet. And also, the ice cream melts pretty fast, as compared to their permanent flavours!
Heading to Icon village and while scrolling through Burpple, I saw this. Lavender and matcha! Together! Coupled! Wtv. Haha. The lavender desserts from other places somehow always turned out too icy; so my expectations were low. But this is so milky, exactly the way I always wished it would be! 😻 The power of Hokkaido milk?
Ah Matchaya, always a treat. I heard they had a new mystery flavour: Lavender - so we had to head down to Icon Village to try it. Smooth and creamy as always, this was beaming with the floral flavour of lavender. Also ordered my favourite flavour and soft serve staple, matcha. I love the intensity (and bitterness) of the matcha - perfect for the matcha purist.
This is Matchaya\'s mystery flavour of the week. Having just returned from Hokkaido last month, this was an instant satisfaction of my craving for lavender softserve which I had frequently in Hokkaido.\n<br />🔸\n<br />It\'s hard to match Hokkaido\'s local dairy desserts but Matchaya\'s lavender soft serve is very competent. The fragrance of lavender is strong, and the milk was creamy. It still borders on being too sweet for me, but the accompanying toasted rice puffs, brown sugar jelly, azuki red bean and warabi mochi with kinako powder helped balanced the sweetness.
💜💜 Really adore the gorgeous lilac colours of this floral softserve that also came with a distinct floral fragrance- a lingering, pleasant sensation to the palate! 😋 Much better than the sakura softserve IMO, with the characteristic floral notes of lavender standing out prominently amidst the milky flavour, so refreshing and aromatic! It\'s a pity the softserve melted rather fast for mine, hindering my prolonged enjoyment 😢 On a side note, I am so gonna head down again for a dual mix of matcha and lavender flavours on my next visit! 💚💜\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Another week, another Matchaya mystery flavour. I remember having my first lavender soft serve in Hokkaido, and this beats it hands down, holiday magic and all.
Lavender Softserve ($6.90)
With bolder, more potent bitter-earthy flavours than the usual matcha; the airy sweet Hokkaido cream espuma layer really balanced things out. Would love if the anko was more of a paste texture but I am more than contented with the bites of crispy rice puffs, chewy matcha warabi mochi, and shiratama!
I already love the matcha here but this limited edition Koicha was even better with a more intense bitterness!and also a reason to add some Kuromitsu 😌
Back (yet again) for this week\'s mystery flavour at Matchaya - Koicha. Although it physically resembles the Matcha soft serve, this cup of Koicha packed a more intense bitterness which I really liked! Props to them for adding Matcha powder in between the swirls as well. It was creamy but I wasn\'t that big a fan of the thicker and stickier than usual texture. 
It was similar to matcha but a lot more bitter &amp; strong in flavour and felt a bit like 苦茶 😅. The bitterness was eased by the sweet red beans, rice puffs and Shiratama (not sure if it\'s worth the added $1 for Shiratama though). As always, I\'m won over by the smooth texture and rich flavours of Matchaya\'s soft serve but the too strong bitterness of koicha is probably not for me\n<br />📍@matchayasg, 12 Gopeng Street, Icon Village, S078877
Back here again and this time to have the perfect balance of sweet delicate Darjeeling tea with its lingering aromatic floral afternotes. And as always, Matchaya’s latest weekly mystery flavour, Royal Milk Tea ($5.90) had an exceptional creamy texture!
I love a good soft serve ice cream and Matchaya is high up on my list of fave spots. 
Back again at my favourite soft serve spot before this week’s mystery flavour, Royal Milk Tea is swapped away! As usual, I enjoyed the thick creamy texture of Matchaya\'s softserves and in particular of this flavour, the use of Darjeeling tea brought out lovely floral notes with the right amount of sweetness.
Their signature Matcha soft serves were smooth yet refined, creamy but not buttery. The Matcha soft serve struck a beautiful balance between sweet and bitter. Super creamy and aromatic! Love it! 
@matchayasg fans (@cweizhi and I) at it again because there\'s a new flavour 😍 the Royal Milk Tea was sooooo good! Loved the aromatic floral notes from the Darjeeling tea :) #burpple #dessert #matchayasg
Kuromitsu Softserve ($5.90)
Another delightful creation, it\'s like they have a list of all my favourite Japanese flavours and are slowly ticking them off. 😛
Finally visited and tried the highly raved softserve at Matchaya and we had a regular cup of Matcha and Kuromitsu Softserve to share.Kuromitsu was the mystery flavour for the week and it was a very sweet dessert, great for the sweet tooths around! 6/10 The Matcha flavour was bitter in comparison. 5/10 We are not sure if the bitterness was amplified after the extra sweetness though. It was a great match when eaten together nevertheless! Kae was disappointed that we could not try the Houjicha flavoured Softserve as it is only available at their outlet at The Cathay. $5.90, +$1 for mixing flavours
I swear, Matchaya never fails to surprise me with new flavours which just pump me up too much that I literally ran down after finding out they served this for this week\'s special. Personally, I felt that their Sakura flavour was a lot more sweeter as compared to their regular flavours, but it still had a very subtle Sakura taste to it. Get your hands on it before it disappears with the season! 🌸
Having a light floral taste, the mystery flavour for this week is a nice dessert to have and it tastes good too!
One of the richest, most flavourful matcha desserts I\'ve had. Soft serve was rich and creamy, did not melt quickly, and it wasn\'t too sweet - so it doesn\'t feel to overwhelming.

.
I love genmaicha (roasted brown rice green tea) and had to make a trip down when I found out it\'s this week\'s mystery flavour. It\'s so fragrant I even could smell the genmaicha before I ate it too 😍
A collaboration with Neh Neh Pop, this Cha Cha Pop ($8) from @matchayasg makes me go Ga Ga Pop. I just like to think of it as an atas Japanese equivalent of Magnum.\n<br />_\n<br />The outer shell consisting of black molasses and houjicha feuilletine and matcha dip with toasted sesame adds the crunchy kick to the rich, creamy matcha ice cream. Can this matcha heaven open another outlet in the east, please?\n<br />_
I always enjoy matchaya\'s soft serves because of their quality and how close it is to a taste of Japan. I really love their kinako soft serve because it\'s so unique and so delicious!
I got the kinako kuromitsu ($9.90) with a mix of this week\'s mystery flavour and matcha (+$1 for mix), which is pretty pricey for a dessert. So I was chiding myself about how I should\'ve spent the money better, but the moment I took a bite all the monetary and caloric regrets went away. The kinako flavour is fragrant, nutty, and sweet. The soft serve is so thick and creamy, and it doesn\'t melt into watery disappointment like a sanum does. I didn\'t appreciate the shiratama (round mochi balls) but the warabi mochi are pretty good because they\'re softer and tastier from a coating of nutty soybean powder. The matcha flavour\'s a little too bitter for my liking, but you can tell it\'s made from quality matcha and I see why the flavour has its fans. The matcha soft serve has a more intense and noticeable flavour than the kinako, and goes well with the sweet azuki paste and crunchy rice thingys in the bottom of the parfait as the add-ons mitigate some of the bitterness. Overall, the flavours are amazing and combination of textures are on point - guess I have to be grateful it\'s so out of the way for me and this expensive, or I\'d be here every other week at least. p.s. @matchaya please make kinako a permanent flavour tq
Layered roasted soybean soft serve interspersed with crunchy rice crisps, smooth, puréed azuki and topped with Shirotama and Warabi Mochi coated with kinako powder. Matchaya does an incredible job with its roasted flavours, and with its delicious smokey aroma, Kinako is definitely one of my favourites in their collection! #matchayasg #softserve #burpple
Light chestnut sweet flavor complements with the slight bitter taste from matcha.
Preferred Black Sesame (S$5.90) to Matcha (S$5.90). Creamy rich aroma of black sesame is recommended!
Smooth, creamy &amp; milky soft serve to satisfy the sweet tooth (S$5.90).
Black white gold was an apt description of this Shirogoma (using organic roasted white sesame) soft serve parfait. As usual, much thoughts were given into this - they are very specific about the ingredients use, sourcing for sesame with a certain fat content to bring out the best of it. 
We all need a beautiful parfait to start our day! I love the one I got from @matchayasg 😋😋😋
Black sesame parfait w mixed kinako &amp; matcha soft serve from Sunday. The wait at the bridal studio was too long for me to bear and I hopped over to matchaya for this! 😍 Though the wait was rather long as they delicately placed the layers of the parfait, it was all worth it. (When I got back to the studio, I could sashay right into their wardrobe w/o waiting 😂😂) 🍴\n<br />The slight sweet toasted taste of kinako definitely complements the slight bitterness of matcha. 🤤 and that super thick and smooth black sesame sauce. 😋😋 plus the rice puffs and adzuki beans in between 😍😍😍\n<br />🍴\n<br />Might be sweater day today but I\'m still dreaming of cold parfaits 🤤\n<br />#burpple #matchaya #matchasoftserve #kinako
The parfait is filled with toasted rice crispy which doesn\'t seem to go soggy, azuki, mochi balls &amp; Kinako powder! \n<br />Thanks @cweizhi for bringing me along! It\'s goooooooood 😍
A really filling parfait with awesome matcha soft serve! Love the biscuit at the side but the mochi was way too floury.
Matchaya serves great soft serves that make me look forward to their mystery flavours every week.
Dessert before dinner is just so tempting. Throwback to the other day when we had Matcha with Nama Chocolate soft serve layered with Azuki bean. Thick matcha swirls mixed with milky nama chocolate, layered with slightly sweet bits of Azuki. While it was satisfying, I\'m still rooting for their houjicha and goma instead. However not sure if I\'m the only one who feel it, but they are pretty over priced for something so small.
I even asked, will this cause insomnia cause\' tea 😝but I love tea lattes after this! \n<br />I still drink their hojicha. Just last week, I got their hojicha chocolate drink!
Akin to a light nut butter cream, Matchaya has done it again and this time with their latest mystery flavour, KINAKO. Sprinkled with more kinako powder (specially sourced and imported from Japan), the softserve was certainly denser and a tad coarser than the usual but just as satisfying. No subtle, earthy sweetness, as each spoonful is filled with the nutty, roasted and unmistakably addictive flavour of kinako. And the best idea yet was for me to add on shiratama for that extra chewy texture. YAS!
@beaverwoo had Black Sesame Parfait /w Kinako soft serve (so hers had a dark earthy drizzling of black sesame) while I opted for Kinako Kuromitsu Parfait /w mixed Matcha + Kinako soft serve flavours 🍦🍦🍦 Other parfait variations have tea jelly! 😍 And kinako is only the mystery flavor for this week MUST TRY IT SOON BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS #burpple
Love the Kinako flavour (mystery flavour for the week)! The taste of Matcha is intense- Matcha lovers will love this. It has a really thick texture, it\'s almost like frozen paste. Will definitely return for more!
My my, the kinako Softserve was just perfect for me, smooth, creamy and nutty - just so good! The parfait ($9.90) came with layers of rice crispies, azuki beans, warabi mochi and dango! I think I need another one whole cup of just kinako softserve all for myself ✌🏻
Saw that the new flavour was out and knew I had to come here again because KINAKO. Thanks fellow zhi for accompanying me tho it didn\'t take much to lure her out with food😛
For just $7.90, get 3 generous toppings (kuromitsu tea jelly, toasted rice puffs (swapped for more adzuki), adzuki paste with any choice of your soft serve! Only available for this week, is their special flavour Kinako!! Have been extremely excited and wildly anticipating the release of this flavour ever since I got some hints of them wanting to experiment with this flavour. 
Cause 🍦all day err day makes me a happy person 😍 Can\'t even begin to say how excited I was when spying (yes spying cause I stalk @matchayasg every Monday for their weekly flavours) their amazeballs parfait illustrations — a new dessert option they\'ve just quietly pushed out barely a week ago! Even bigger surprise when I popped by to find out about their latest soft serve flavour: Kinako. Those who tried the Japanese soybean powder would know it for its characteristic malty and earthy tones, adding a mellow sort of richness especially to desserts. Simple yet complex at the same time, it\'s a lovely base for Matchaya\'s new soft serve parfaits; though if you really wanna get a hit of that malty goodness then best enjoy it alone 😉
Went all out with our choice of parfait at Matchaya - Kinako Kuromitsu along with this week\'s mystery softserve flavour (Kinako) and we were rewarded with mouthfuls of the loveliest toasty nutty flavours! Topped with warabi mochi, shiratama dango (so soft and chewy!) kinako powder, azuki purée and kuromitsu syrup, the play of textures here made it extra fun to eat. What I enjoyed most though, was that hidden bed of rice pops that changed everything up with its delightful crunch. The Kinako softserve feels sweeter than its past offerings but really satisfying. I think this is one of my favourite flavours from them! 
Scooted straight down after I saw they released their newest flavour – KINAKO! 😍
At Matchaya once again and this time to try their newest creations, parfaits. Loaded with kuromitsu sugar syrup, azuki purée, crunchy toasted rice puffs, roasted kinako powder, chewy shiratama balls and soft warabi mochi; each element just added to the whole sweet experience - that is their Kinako Kuromitsu Parfait. Had mine with a mix of luscious matcha and Hokkaido milk creamy swirls which needs no more introduction. Yum!
Constantly creating new items/ flavours without compromising on quality, I\'ve never left Matchaya empty-handed nor disappointed (except when they\'re closed😂) - this time with 5 different parfaits to choose from: azuki/ shiratama/ kinako kuromitsu/ warabi mochi/ black sesame!
But yay! I Managed to finally get a taste of @matchayasg \'s hokkaido milk soft serve with matcha salt! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Black Sesame Parfait (S$9.90)\n<br />Served with choice of soft serve 🍦 flavour \n<br />Available at @MatchayaSG \n<br />Hokkaido Milk 🍼 soft serve 🍦 layered with toasted rice puffs, and azuki red bean, topped with black sesame sauce, shiratama (2pcs). There\'s supposed to have black sesame wafer but it was not available so it was replaced with another shiratama (rice ball).\n<br />Like the feel of crunchiness of the rice pop in the mouth 👄 even it was filled with the soft serve 🍦. The shiratama was soft and chewy, quite nice with the black sesame sauce. The azuki red bean was a paste like a ball lumped together, not quite what I was expecting.\n<br />|\n<br />Matchaya 抹茶屋\n<br />Address 🏠 : 12 Gopeng Street, # 01-72 Icon Village, Singapore 🇸🇬 078 877\n<br />Tel ☎ : 9837 3187\n<br />Open 💈 : 12pm - 8pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Tanjong Pagar (EW15)
Salt?! You must be weirded out by this combination but I cannot emphasise how mind blowing this tasted. I\'ll willingly get high sodium any day for this. Together with the Hokkaido milk soft serve (get this together with the Yuzu salt, it taste like sea salt caramel ice cream) it was a seriously addictive combination. #saltbae me this cup and I\'ll be a happy camper. \n<br />P.s. Congrats to Matchaya to opening its second outlet soon at Dhoby!!! It means I can go down much, match, matchaya more often 😏
The soft serve is creamy, dusted with hojicha powder, and is well-balanced with the roasted taste of hojicha, leaving a mellow aftertaste.
And the first message i saw this morning was a message from one of my managers, R. It was a long message that says good luck and hope the results are what I expected, followed by a sharing of his experience on how he is a living example that results don\'t define you. So so so touched by how he took the effort to send me some encouragement, he didn\'t have to, but he did. And that\'s why I really really appreciate my workplace because of such colleagues. 真誠打動人心，謝謝妳們真心待我❤
Just receiving my daily calcium intake with a shot of gooey robust black sesame sauce.
eventhough I\'m still under the weather.. nothing makes u feel better than ice cream! This Hokkaido milk soft serve really hit the spot and I regret not having it just on it\'s own.. it\'s sooo good.. milky yet not to sweet Abd the black sesame sauce just compliments it excellently! Can\'t wait for you guys to bring it back again! @that_dex #burrple
Be sure to add on that amazing paste, they even sell it at $12.90! 😱
Sprucing it up with a little more fruitiness is the Ichigo Hokkaido Milk, available from yesterday till they run out🏃🏽‍♀️. Creamy, not overly sweet as usual, with the first few mouthfuls a delightful hint of strawberries but I think I\'ll gladly stick to the Hokkaido milk version instead🐮 
Had to find my way here after hearing so many raves about this place. Decided to mix both the current special flavor (milk) and matcha. It was good together but the matcha alone was a little too bitter for my taste. Would go great with some sweet toppings or syrup drizzled! Generally a bit pricey too but a lovely treat for the taste buds!
••\n<br />The taste and rich texture of the Matcha are  definitely worth trying it.
Fuel through the week with Matchaya’s latest whilst stock last flavour - Hokkaido Strawberry Milk Softserve!
Spot that light shade of pink, created specially for Valentine\'s week 💝 The Hokkaido Milk version is from today till sold out, then it would be reverted to normal Milk version. \n<br />Still prefer the original Hokkaido Milk for its stronger milky taste - the strawberry took that remarkable fragrance away 💔 but strawberry lovers should definitely give it a go.
At this rate, I\'m gonna go running over to Matchaya every Monday (lucky for me I\'ve no class) to surprise myself with their weekly new mystery flavour! 🏃🏻‍♀️ After the Hokkaido Milk flavour last week, say hello to Ichigo, which is strawberry! I miss the hokkaido milk fragrance and would have liked this milkier, but the subtle strawberry sweetness was still really enjoyable. As with all Matchaya\'s softserves, the creaminess and smoothness is to die for and there\'s none of that artificial tasting stuff here. Head on down soon for this is only available in limited quantity!
OMG so so good, I think this had successfully topped my favourites @matchayasg ❤️Hopefully, this comes back real soon 🙏🏻 Psst... next flavour is out - Ichigo (strawberry), specially for Valentines week!  Can you do Hokkaido Strawberry Milk instead?
Went for a full cup of Hokkaido Milk to get my calcium like a good kid. Smooth, creamy and light, melts seemingly faster than usual. Was expecting a milkier flavour but as usual, an enjoyable treat! Go for the additional shot of goma ($2.10) - goes superbly well together with the thick, unsweetened sesame sauce giving additional fragrance to it and well-balanced sweetness as a whole. They ought to keep this on the menu cos I\'m pretty sure it goes well with anything🤷🏻‍♀️ 
Here\'s something sweet for you on this lovey dovey day! May you spend the day with loved ones, be it a person or food!\n<br />💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕\n<br />Where to Find This?\n<br />@matchayasg\n<br />📍\n<br />12 Gopeng Street, Icon Village 01-72, S078877\n<br />⏰\n<br />Daily: 12pm to 8pm\n<br />💰\n<br />S$6.90 Nett (Mix: Matcha/Hokkaido Milk)
Hokkaido Milk Softserve ($5.90)
Managed to find the stall near at the corner of the mall but it was worth it even on the rain. The mystery topping (hokkaido milk) was really good along with the matcha soft serve!
Hokkaido milk was deliciously smooth and creamy, and was incredibly satisfying. I visit so often (4th time and counting!) that I\'m really tempted to get their new \"membership card\" now...should I? 🤔 #burpple

.
Mmm mm mmmmm... Rushed right down when I heard they were doing a Hokkaido milk soft serve and my tummy folds are thanking me. 
Mystery flavor of the week at Matchaya is Hokkaido Milk - creamy, smooth and thick, but I was secretly hoping for a slightly stronger milk taste. That said, I also think it\'s because of the combi I chose, for the intense Matcha quickly overpowered the Hokkaido Milk. If you\'re all up for it, I would say to get a full cup of the latter instead!
My favourite soft serve place in the entire of Singapore because the flavours are always so so so intense - which just shows how they do not skimp on good quality ingredients! I wanted my houjicha fix so badly that week- but they didn\'t have it (houjicha is my favourite flavour!) I specially did come down here to try their Black Sesame soft serve though - and I\'m so pleased to say it is sooooo good (IT IS NOW TIED with Houjicha as my favourite flavour HAHA) It\'s just such a good punch 🤛 of potent black sesame with the perfect balance of sweetness. I dragged my siblings down that day (because I kept raving about the soft serves when I went home, that my sister really wanted to try it for herself) and they agree that Matchaya serves the best Matcha Soft Serve in Singapore ☺️ They also said that the ice cream doesn\'t dilute in taste even after eating the WHOLE CUP. You can taste the intensity of the flavours up to the very last bite. Black Sesame soft serve was the bottom swirl, while Matcha was the top swirl. I recommend you get separate swirls to enjoy the flavours as pronounced as possible!!! 
Possibly one of the three matcha desserts that I actually like – the other two being the Matcha Soba parfait at Hvala Waffle Bar, and the Marvellous Matcha at Ninja Cut.
Thanks to the Burpple community that I got to know about Matchaya\'s mystery flavour of the week - Azuki (red bean)! 😍 As azuki soft serve is available only until tomorrow (15 Jan), I had to chiong down today!
Featuring the latest azuki flavour, with a thick dollop of red beans in between the swirls. Loveeee 😋 #burpple
You know, when the weather out there is so horrendous, it is always a relief to have something cold to cool you down. And the Cha Cha Pop (S$8.00) from Matchaya did just that. Imagine a creamsicle of Matcha ice cream coated with a layer of Hojicha and then dipped into Matcha sauce in a slanted fashion. What comes out is this beautiful creation by Neh Neh Pop and Matchaya.
Who can resist this pairing?
i used to think the matcha soft serve was good. \n<br />then i tried the houjicha which blew my mind.\n<br />i picked up the pieces off the floor and tried the nama chocolate which was even better.\n<br />but the azuki soft serve blows it out of the water. lightly sweet and the red bean flavour doesn\'t overpower. the soft-serve here is properly churned - you can turn the cup over and it won\'t drop out!! (i should know, i tried 😬)\n<br />seriously these guys are the best. they maintain an active social media presence and always reply to questions promptly. (well usually i ask what flavour is on sale that week 😂😂)
Azuki Softserve ($6.90)
🍴\n<br />Braved the rain for this and boy was it worth it. The genmaicha is unbelievably fragrant, the smell of roasted brown rice is toooooo good. 🤤 Though it kinda overpowered the hojicha a little, but still an amazing combi. The sticky gooey texture was amazing! ☺️\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #softserve #genmaicha #hojicha #matchaya
Bought a 40 dollar Matchaya gift voucher for my friend\'s birthday because we can never get enough of this place. Seriously, this place sells the best Matcha/Houjicha soft serve in the entire of Singapore! You have to try it! After eating this, I simply can\'t be satisfied with any other soft serve because I will demand to have my Matchaya! And plus points for the friendly service of their chatty staff whom never fail to brighten my day with their smiles and eagerness to tell me about their work. They truly care for their business and take pride in churning out creamy yet delicate soft serves that do the flavours justice. I just want to eat all their mystery flavours all day everyday!
Matcha Soft Serve Ice Cream ($5.90)
Fans of their matcha Swiss rolls would love this. First dig into the chocolate sponge, which was pretty ok, but all eyes lit up when they reached the fragrant bittersweet matcha cream enclosed within. We were also occasionally surprised by the crunch of chocolate pearls littered within the cake!\n<br />🔸\n<br />Till next year. Hope everyone had enjoyed your Christmas!
The mystery flavour for Christmas from @matchayasg would be the elusive chestnut flavour, best to top up to get their chestnut purée and rum soaked chestnuts! If you are like me and not exactly the greatest fan of chestnut, you should definitely give this a chance (if it\'s still available) - cause the chestnut flavour is really mild but fragrant! Super yummy 😋
Lucky to have tried this before it\'s gone tomorrow! The kuri softserve was light and creamy, contrasted with bits of strong rum-soaked chestnut. Not forgetting the usual bittersweet goodness of matcha. 
Usually i don’t like Swiss rolls because the sponge is normally too dry for me. But Matchaya’s matcha roll ($4.90) is not! It complements the creamy matcha which is slightly bitter with a hint of natural sweetness.
Ever since Matchaya, every trip to Tanjong Pagar ends on a sweet note with one of their soft serves. Gorgeously bittersweet, I loved the intensity of matcha flavours here in its thick, fragrant creamy swirls. Have never yet been disappointed with Matchaya\'s offerings thus far and can\'t wait for even more flavours to be introduced!
The deep, smokey aroma of roasted green tea gave way to intense black sesame as we dived into the little cup of goodness. It was so heavenly that we couldn\'t resist a second upsized one ($9) after we devoured the first within minutes 😋 #matchayasg #dessert #dessertporn #burpple
Could not decide between the two flavours i had both!! Apparently the flavours blend excellently well together, even the staff admitted it\'s her favourite! Super greedy me had chestnut puree and bailey\'s soaked chestnut bits as toppings! The best i\'ve had so far in Singapore! It\'s a shame the counter has no tables and chairs to sit as it is located in a small corner of Icon Village. However, it will not hold me from coming back there in the future as i\'m yet to try the matha one, very soon! 🍦🍵 Btw, goma (black sesame) is the mystery\'s flavour this week, go get it before it changes in few days! 
Picked the twirled flavor : sesame and houjicha. They did not had matcha stock when we were there. But they did not fail, it was rich in the flavor and it may be the kind of dessert you would likely come back for.
It\'s Christmas month, even their soft serve look like a lonely pine tree covered in snow on a winter night!\n<br />🔸\n<br />We were far from lonely, the three of us shared this thick bittersweet matcha with smooth melty nama chocolate softserve. We just keep digging this, and imagine the joy during the lucky moments when we hit the bailey\'s soaked chestnuts. Now I\'m really anticipating their pure kuri flavours which I missed last week, I know they\'ll be back and I\'m waiting!
The matcha icecream ($5.90) is not sweet, and leaves a mild bitter aftertaste. Solid! They also have 400g tubs now and a huge range of matcha stuff. I will be back!
Bringing back the goods from their Japan trip, Matchaya\'s Kuri Softserve is probably gonna run out soon and I had to get my grubby little hands on it! 🙌
Kuri Softserve ($7.90)
At Matchaya once again and this time to try their mystery flavour - Chestnut (Kuri) available for, of course, a limited time only.
I don\'t really frequent this end of Tanjong Pagar much, which is why it seemed like forever before I have their matcha soft-serve a try.
Both the hojicha and nama chocolate soft serves were absolutely stunning!! It was a delightful cup of smooth and creamy textures combined with rich flavours! Highly recommend!
Houjicha x Nama Choco Softserve ($6.90)
This week at Matchaya: the rich smooth creamy swirls of Nama Chocolate with its sweetness balanced by the bittersweet, smokey fragrance of Hojicha. Still as good as I remember😌
You get both matcha and houjicha in their Swiss rolls, choose between a matcha sponge with houjicha cream, or this pictured which is houjicha sponge with matcha cream.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The matcha centre was thick and creamy with their signature pleasant matcha taste. I suspected we should have waited for this to warm to room temperature so that the sponge could be softer and close to that of Japanese confectionery. Nevertheless, I still like the matcha cream and noticeable houjicha fragrance in its sponge.
📸 Credit: @tiaralim.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is my favorite Matchaya\'s soft serve to date - the Genmaicha and Houjicha Soft Serve. Two roasted fragrance compliment each other really well, even though the genmaicha was also really good on its own!\n<br />🔸\n<br />This photo is taken by my foodie friend @tiaralim, who could describe her food and dining experience really well. She also has a refined palate that could differentiate between the various dimensions of what we ate. Try reading some of her writing at her IG and you may agree with me that it\'s concise, punchy, yet elegant!
Finally finally struck this off my wishlist of 6 months.\n<br />💫\n<br />They were out of their matcha, so we went for the Genmaicha, and no I don\'t think it was a compromise in any way. The slight bitter-sweetness of the green tea, earthy fragrance of roasted brown rice with nutty undertones all melded into this balanced soft-serve. I haven\'t visited Japan, but i think I got a good taste of it here. 💫\n<br />Didn\'t plan to come today, but spontaneity always adds an extra joy. If you want to try this flavour, tomorrow is the last day before it is switched for another. ;)
Genmaicha x Matcha Softserve
Product true to picture. 😂 Like Magnum but more, with its extremely crunchy matcha-black-sesame shell, encasing the frozen matcha ice cream that is balanced in sweetness and matcha bitterness. Best to let it adjust a few degrees from its completely frozen state for best enjoyment. So glad to have ticked this off the list, and wasn\'t disappointed.
Best part is the silky, syrupy, hella concentrated black sesame goo
First time visiting matchaya and decided to go for their soft serve mystery flavour which was Genmaicha (Green tea with roasted brown rice tossed with a dash of matcha). Decided to pair it with houjicha as well and the falvours compliment each other really well!😍 
Pictured is the new Kuromitsu shot not on the menu! They\'re testing it, you may request for it to see if you like this \"black honey\", although the popular goma shots are still available too. The fun thing about these shots is that you can mix and match the shots and soft serve to see which is the best combination.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Meanwhile I\'m loving their latest Goma/Houjicha Twirl, two roasted flavours in a single soft serve. They meld seamlessly and it felt like the goma had been given a boost in its roasted fragrance.
Laid my hands on the hojicha and goma ice cream with a shot of thick gooey goma sauce (not pictured). It is an immensely rich texture that upon pouring, coats the ice cream like a cape.\n<br />🔅\n<br />And had a long chat with @kelvincheejv. Really looking forward to the day when I can get my matcha fix at any corner of Singapore and new innovative dishes that are in the form of ideas but potentially will be realized soon!\n<br />🔅\n<br />I can\'t wait to see... 😌😌\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋 Matchaya\n<br />💰$5.90 soft serve, add $2.10 for shots, add $2.10 for upsize.\n<br />🍴#01-72 Icon Village, 12 Gopeng Street, Singapore 078877 (Tanjong Pagar MRT)\n<br />⏲Opening Hours: Mon to Sun 12PM-8PM\n<br />☎️Tel: 9837 3187
Between this and the pure matcha flavour, we like this more. Like the matcha\'s, this is also rich and creamy with an authentic taste of Japanese tea. But one difference won us over - this one has a nutty roasted scent. 💚🍦
So I had to add that dark chocolate sauce!!\n<br />🍦\n<br />Why do I go through the trouble and pay extra to have ice cream here then? Why not just eat somewhere else where the sweetness is just right? Because the soft serve texture is superb- smooth and creamy!! Plus the low sweetness and strong tea flavors makes me feel less sinful for indulging in ice cream when I should be dieting..🙈\n<br />🍦\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />12 Gopeng Street\n<br />Icon Village 01-72
Love it!!! I have a sweet tooth, but when it comes to my dessert, I like the sweetness cut to minimal. The slight bitterness of the matcha did an excellent job in balancing the overall sweetness to my kind of sweetness!
Matchaya is a small corner outlet in a hidden part of Icon Village at tanjong pagar. If you\'ve been there before, it is pretty near Two Men Bagels. If not, you can enter from the temple side and just follow the sign towards the toilet. 
🔅\n<br />This time round introducing the 100% organic black sesame shot which is super gao (rich) in taste and flavors.\n<br />🔅\n<br />The aromas of the sesame paste lingers in the air as the thick sauce is poured over the ice cream which remains solid and tall in stride. Whereas the black sesame is luxuriously rich with a nutty flavor, and it\'s intensity would nag at you the whole day.\n<br />🔅\n<br />Can\'t believe this \n<br />This ice cream I kiss\n<br />Three times a week\n<br />I\'m not going weak\n<br />Back to Matchaya\n<br />No matter how far\n<br />To find new flavors\n<br />Behind all the labor\n<br />To savour rich flavors\n<br />Done so clever\n<br />To seek a new love\n<br />Who becomes my savior.\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋 Matchaya\n<br />💰$5.90 soft serve, add $2.10 for shots, add $2.10 for upsize.\n<br />🍴#01-72 Icon Village, 12 Gopeng Street, Singapore 078877 (Tanjong Pagar MRT)\n<br />⏲Opening Hours: Mon to Sun 12PM-8PM\n<br />☎️Tel: 9837 3187
Dedicating this to the most oozesome and 💚 delicately handmade matcha 🍵🍃 swiss roll that made my day ~ 😊😊☺️🙂🙂 from @matchayasg provided a much-needed reprieve from the day\'s hustle &amp; bustle 🙃🙂😊☺️😌 as I call it a day tonight; I\'m still relinquishing the moment that left me all dreamy 🌬☁️️☁️️💭🌙🌃
And it was mind-blowingly good 😍 luscious, creamy and smooth soft serve that was deliciously gao. I\'m glad that I tried the #matcha flavour first, so that I could give it a verdict without being swayed by the other popular flavours like houjicha/goma (which I can\'t wait to try too!). I loved the depth of the green tea flavour, and the bitterness balanced out the sweet Nama chocolate just right. It\'s the last day of this matcha/Nama combination, so head there by 8pm to get your hands on it before a new combi is revealed tomorrow! #burpple #softserve
\"Genuinely best matcha soft serve\", least that\'s what my tongue told me 😌🍵 just look at its color sans filter 💚-💚 vibrant invigorating lush green never fails to make me green with envy 👁👉🏼👅💚 the richness of the matcha along with this week\'s partner-in-crime, aka Mr Nama 🍫 Last day of this duo combi, I missed out on the last pair which was houjicha &amp; matcha a week ago (seems like I haven\'t gotten over it yet 😖) 
Third time\'s the charm as I finally got my hands on Matchaya’s Matcha Soft Serve on the latest visit!
It\'s a close fight between Matchaya and my longtime fave Tsujiri. The ice-cream had a dense creamy texture and prominent tea flavours. I could even taste the smokiness of houjicha! If you can\'t decide between matcha and houjicha (I think there\'s sesame too), you can opt for a mix which was what we did. Service is a little slow though as the shop at Icon Village seems short-handed.
I froze this and the black sesame cream became ice-cream like!\n<br />Subtly sweet and light. They are more well known for their ice cream!
Am back for the second running when I heard they were bringing in the hojitcha flavour this week. Love it! The two Flavours blend really well together.. think I need to take a break to recover my waistline after two weeks 😋〰 #BURPPLE @mybulgingtummy
Finally got to try @matchayasg roasted black sesame and no words can express how awesome it is 😍😍😍💯💯💯💯. If you like matcha soft serve as well, just get the swirl one! Or buy one of each ✌🏼️😋 $5.90 per cup!
[New launch today] We love matcha, and we love kurogoma! Yet, this is the better than having the best of both worlds, because the roasted fragrance of the black sesame compliments the bittersweetness of the uji matcha.\n<br />🔸\n<br />And you may already know it, Matchaya\'s soft serve is really rich and creamy, posing a dilemma whether to share it with a friend or to have all to yummy to yourself. We shared 😊\n<br />🔸\n<br />Available at Icon Village starting today.
Houjicha soft serve - It is smooth and creamy with a lovely roasted flavour unique to houjicha. With a crisp buttery cookie on the side and pure houjicha powder sprinkled on top.
When it comes to matcha, we spare no expense in indulging this bittersweet rich flavour that we love so much 😘. The regular cup is tagged at $5.90 and you can upsize it for additional $2.10. 
It felt a little small for $5.90 price tag. Regardless, the quality is there 👍🏻
Matchaya (抹茶屋) - Started by a young couple with a Passion to serve Matcha &amp; Houjicha. 🍵 Matchaya has been around for awhile making appearance as a pop-up store before investing in a Physical Store at Icon Village, Tanjong Pagar 📍\n<br />.\n<br />Initially wanted to to try their Matcha Soft Serve but only their Hojicha Soft Serve (💵S$5.90) is available because co-founder Kevin wants the public to try other flavours that Matchaya offers rather than just Matcha. 🍦\n<br />The Hojicha Soft Serve is Fragrant, it also is Thick (not like your usual soft serve) with a Beautiful Aromatic Texture &amp; what I like most about it is that it\'s not so Sweet, the Sugar level is kept at a Minimal so as not to overpower the Taste of the Tea. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Matchaya offers a \"Mystery Flavour\" every once in a while. The last Mystery Flavour was Roasted Black Sesame, follow their Instagram Acc for more updates! \n<br />One of the Better Tea Houses I\'ve tried so far with Ingredients sourced in Japan &amp; of course, Support Local. 🎏
Perfect for the scorching hot weather. Pop by @matchayasg today to get Goma Softserve before it will be replace by Houjicha next week. 芝麻糊 made into softserve but remain fragrant and thick. Definitely a good choice!
The sesame flavour was so on point 👌🏻 they seem to be selling only one flavour per week until the new machine comes or somewhere along that line. Next week is hojicha! Gosh, what a bloody hot day it is.
Once again bowled over by Matchaya with their fantastic black sesame creations. The dense cake and fluffy delicate black sesame cream makes the Swiss roll a great tea cake to share. The show stealer though, is definitely the black sesame soft serve. It\'s thick, it\'s rich, is what I\'d imagine my fave 芝麻糊 softserve-ified to be.
Tucked in a little corner of Icon is this little Japanese soft serve joint. It\'s so bitter and creamy. Better than tsujiri!
This former strictly pop-up-only store has found a permanent home in the CBD. Nestled within Icon Village, swing by the adorable takeaway stand with your colleagues for a taste of their lusciously rich, creamy soft serve ($5.90). Excellent tea-flavoured ice creams are hard to come by (we often lament a too sorbet-like texture or a barely-there tea flavour), but Matchaya gets it right — intensely tea-infused and holds up well despite the blazing heat. At the moment, they offer three flavours, namely Matcha, Houjicha and Milk, but we hear there are new flavours to look forward to — just ask the friendly store owners. Only one flavour is available everyday, so it\'s best to check their Facebook for regular updates. We make it a point to head down to Matchaya whenever our favourite Houjicha flavour is available — it\'s so incredibly dense, flavourful and creamy that it bears a close resemblance to a strongly brewed cup of houjicha!\n<br />Avg price: $5 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Vanessa Kou
6 flavours : lychee rose, houjicha, matcha, yuzu, nama chocolate and I forgot the last one.
I FINALLY😱 got to try this place that has been picking up popularity because of it\'s soft serve and neh neh pop (on left;as it is called) ice cream. For the matcha soft serve, it was good that it was not sweet and very rich in matcha flavour! But it had quite a beady texture to it I\'m not sure how to explain. (I prefer the one at bugis plus-more milky!)However, I really loved the other one! It had a bit of sesame flavour at first, then it was yummy green tea and chocolate flavour with Gula Melaka in the middle(I think it was that or caramel?) 😍 Minus points was that it was really quite hard to find the place 😓 it\'s located at the extension side of icon village so do look out for it. Overall damage ($8+$5.90=13.90)-quite pricy. Good to try at least once ☺️
💸 $5.90 • one of the best Matcha soft serve! Smooth and taste really authentic! 
Matcha Softserve ($5.90)
I had previously used their matcha and houjicha powder while working at one of the cafes in town, and was impressed by the strong flavour it possessed. Yet, I was even more impressed with this soft serve. Lightly dusted with matcha powder, the soft serve was thick, creamy and bittersweet. Surprisingly, it didn\'t melt that fast too! Now, I have to find an excuse to return to try their houjicha flavour.
The Hojicha soft serve was so good! Dusted with more hojicha powder, this was rich, bitter-sweet with a roasted fragrance. 
Apart from the Houjicha/Matcha soft serve, cakes and Brûlée Toast that are often seen on social media, Matchaya also sells Macarons. These are well-executed — delicate but firm shells with tiny feet that shatters so beautifully without causing a mess with every bite, holding up pretty well. Between the two, I would prefer the Lychee Rose which is Bandung-like with a little twist; the Houjicha\'s aroma felt overwhelmed with sweetness instead.
Perhaps one of the best Matcha soft-serve you can get in Singapore, if it\'s not the best. This is what Houjicha fans will love — strong and roasty tea aroma here that\'s powered by nothing but pure and intense Houjicha flavours without being made creamy not sweet. It\'s strengths is built seemingly on the point that it doesn\'t seem to try to accommodate to those who might prefer a more balanced flavours — a definite must try for hardcore Houjicha lovers.
Man oh man, as I step out the house today to become the very best, the intense sun makes me wish I had one of these babies! ☀️😰
Mmmmm… Magically dusted with Houjicha powder, this creamy soft serve sure packs a robust punch filled with pleasant roasted tea fragrance. Perfectly harmonized, the buttery biscuit served together also adds texture and does help a little to further balance the intense bitter nutty undertone of Houjicha!

Went all the way down to Tanjong pagar to try this new soft serve at the Icon village. I must say the matcha taste is unmistakably bitter, just how I like it.\n<br />Though the overall texture of the soft serve is not really to my liking. The soft serve was not dense enough and it felt like I was eating icing more than ice cream.\n<br />Can\'t wait to try the neh neh pop collaboration though. Monster will be back.
(In collaboration with Neh Neh Pop)
Smooth, creamy and rich matcha soft serve with sufficiently intense flavour 》$5.90
And this time, we managed to get hold the last cup of Houjicha soft serve $5.90 at Matchaya 😛 It boost a distinctive sweet-roast taste and aroma of Hoji.
This was AMAZING!!! Boasting a robust full bodied matcha flavor and an unparalleled creaminess, this is absolutely my favorite matcha soft serve in Singapore~ 
Definitely not for the faint-hearted. Lightly sweetened, smooth, with just a touch of its characteristic bitterness, this matcha soft serve is one for the purists. Good on its own, and even more intense with the added shot of matcha. If you have a sweet tooth though, you may wanna hold back on the extra shot — it really is quite bitter.
The matcha soft serve is one of the best in town ! The texture and sweetness is well balanced . The boss is extremely friendly and enthusiastic in explaining the various sweet treats too 👍
Located at icon village near Tangjong Pagar MRT.\n<br />Their drinks comes in Milk, Ceremonial, Clear and Choco variations as well as hot/cold/bottle at your convenience !\n<br />If you really like their drinks, you get them in powder form too !
Mid-week guilty indulgences 😊 Apparently today was the last day for their matcha ice cream so lucky us. It was rich, creamy, smooth and a tinge of bitterness perfect for real matcha lovers. Cha Cha Pop - Rich matcha ice cream with black molasses as surprise centre (ok surprise cos I didn\'t read the descriptions at all), crusted with hojicha/ matcha shell, crunchy feuilletine and fragrant toasted sesame. At $8, despite its hefty price tag, has to be my favouritest favourite creation from Neh Neh Pop thus far!!!! 
.
But we personally felt that the cookie (we had previously) gives a better texture than this Japanese rice puffs which we could hardly taste. Perhaps a more generous scoop of puffs could do the trick. \n<br />But still thumbs up for the consistency and flavour of the matcha flavour soft serve 👍👍
If you are indecisive like us, simply top up 80cents to get half each to $6.70. Interesting spread of matcha and houjicha jam, wish for a thicker and denser bread though. 🍞 Short review up on the web.
Their newly launched matcha soft serve ($5.90) is as good as their Hojicha that I can\'t decide which I like better 😝. Bittersweet just the way we matcha fans like it :) Be sure to pop by for your fix!
YAY TO PH TOMORROW ☺️\n<br />Thank you my dearest @uricacxy for the love😘\n<br />So glad to try this Matcha Mont Blanc Petite Tarts! [6 for $15]
Usually served with a biscuit, which ran out of stock so mine was replaced with crunchy sweet rice puffs.\n<br />🍵\n<br />Smooth, creamy and low on sweetness, this is very very matcha! Matcha lovers will definitely enjoy this but personally, me the non-serious-matcha-lover, prefers my ice cream to be slightly sweeter. And I\'m one who doesn\'t like my desserts too sweet!\n<br />🍵\n<br />For those of you who are like me, I\'ll recommend you to try their Iced Houjicha Chocolate instead. Their Houjicha is served with real chocolate (lined on the sides of the cup), so remember to grab a spoon with the drink so that you can scoop and enjoy the chocolates as well.\n<br />🍵\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />12 Gopeng Street\n<br />Icon Village #01-72\n<br />🍵
The Houjicha Soft Serve ($5.90) is probably the best to help cool you down in the hot weather while making sure you don\'t get a sugar overdose! I love the fact that the soft serve is extremely creamy yet still holds the bittersweet Houjicha flavor. \n<br />For all lovers of Houjicha, they also carry it in the form of a macaron! At 3 pieces for $8.50, you can mix &amp; match from flavors such as Matcha, Houjicha, Yuzu &amp; Nama Choco! My current top picks are the Yuzu &amp; Hojicha! \n<br />Fret not, for all Matcha lovers, the Matcha soft serve is out now! The flavors are gonna be out on a seasonal basis &amp; hopefully will carry a few at once in the near future!
I\'m spoilt for their choices but in the end i decided to go for this. Love the rich, creamy &amp; bittersweet Houjicha softserve($5.90). It has a mild nutty roasted flavour. Definitely live up to my expectation! ☺️😋👍🏻🍦 #burpple
Currently the only soft serve flavour here but fret not as 2 other flavours (Matcha and Milk) will be launched soon. Slightly bitter with roasted nut fragrant, the smooth and thick soft serve is perfect for the crazy weather.
Here\'s CHA CHA POP $8, a ice cream Popsicle collab between @nehnehpopsg and @matchayasg. This stick of goodness is a pairing of matcha and houjicha. Matcha ice cream encased with houjicha and matcha shell, with black molasses, toasted sesame and feuilletine. 🍵🍦 Love the overall combination in one. Despite the hefty price tag for a stick of ice cream, I wouldn\'t mind paying more for something good. #betterthan8dollarsrainbowbagel 😅
This green concoction of Matcha Latte ($5.40) was such a relief to combat the humid weather outside. The smooth milky drink is something that flies off the shelves like hotcakes.\n<br />.\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />Address: 12, Gopeng Street, Icon Village, Unit 01-72, Singapore 078877

Really something worth checking out if you guys\'ve got some time to spare this weekend. I\'ve been following Matchaya for their fantastic tea lattes (really really worth trying if you haven\'t), and now they\'ve got an entire range of Japanese tea noms at their new store! From a variety of Japanese milkhotcoldclearceremonial teas, Hokkaido milk breads with homemade matcha and houjicha jams, to artisanal soft serves, there\'s something for every Jap tea fan. My fave\'s the houjicha soft serve — be sure to give it a try if you\'re there!
Rocky Road, which was my fave out of all the whacky popsicles under the brand, sashayed off the top spot the moment I cha-cha danced my way to Matchaya and landed on this baby. Every layer starting from the matcha and houjicha shell, the matcha ice cream that has the signature Matchaya bittersweetness, till the luscious molasses centre, was delightful to the tastebuds with the varying textures and sweetness. That flowing dark syrup centre was super dope when lapped up with the melting green ice cream - ahh Singapore weather.
The very first Hojicha soft serve in Singapore that blew me away :)) . Makes me Reminisce the good times in Japan :) They also sell matcha, hojicha and other drinks, matcha toasts, rolls and macarons!! Hurry go check them out ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Toasted to perfect crispiness on the outside, the milk bread still retained its fluff in the center. The brûlée (Caramel Crust thingy), Matcha Jam and the matcha powder created the perfect symphony in the mouth with a beautiful blend of sweetness, tea bitterness, and strong fragrance of Matcha. It\'s a work of art! Can\'t wait to try out the other goodies offered! \n<br />Thank you @yhyap for the wonderful recommendation (as always)! And congrats to @myfoodsirens for your opening!
.\n<br />I think statistically, 95% of Singaporeans complain about the weather at least once a day, and i am one of them.\n<br />.\n<br />Was literally sweating in my pants and yearning for some ice cold hojicha latte. @matchayasg where are you 😢
You are definitely one of a kind! 😘 love your refreshing smooth taste with a hint of bitterness ! 😍
.\n<br />This festive season, instead of the usual carbonated drinks, I managed to find comfort over matcha options which has more health benefits. Brewed from authentic matcha powder, a cold matcha latte makes the perfect drink for a sunny afternoon.\n<br />.\n<br />Now I don\'t regret my choice of making the trip down to the pop-up stall and lugged bottles of drinks around orchard which i almost left them behind at a restaurant. 😥
Going at $4.90 each a bottle, these are sourced exclusively from the Kyoto prefecture. Such as Matcha latte, Houjicha latte etc, more info on matchaya.sg 🍵
Organic-certified raw ingredients are used, with no preservatives. My top favorite goes to Houjicha Latte, which has a distinctive roasted tea flavor in it, with a delicate smooth taste and robust leafy fragrance. The sugar level in the tea is minimal, thus not overly sweet. Everyone should really give it a try!
In the meantime, head over to Expo Hall 5 for the Food Fair over this weekend (10-13 Sep) You can visit @Matchayasg for their home-brewed Matcha Latte, Houjicha Latta and Royal Milk Tea at $5 each! \n<br />Best to have it chilled, remember to shake it off well (like Taylor Swift\'s song ya) to avoid the powdery base at the bottom.\n<br />The deletable Royal Milk Latta was low in sugar and medium-bodied, with a lingering aroma of milk tea. Would prefer it to be richer, but overall it was fresh with a smooth finish!
🙋🏻\n<br />Introduced for Valentine\'s day, these boxes of handcrafted Nama Chocolates ($12.90) make perfect gifts. Each box consists of 12 chocolates (matcha/houjicha/kinako). It\'s 73.5% dark cocoa, so not for those with a sweet tooth. I like how they always trim the sweetness level without compromising on quality. -\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #onthetable #sgeats  #eathealthy #burpple  #sgcafe #sgcafehop #matcha #japanesefood  #softserve #japan #8dayseat #greentea

Using black tea from Hyogo Preference, the royal milk tea softserve came with a subtle lingering floral aroma, coupled with a distinct, fragrant characteristic earthy note. Having tried this flavour back when it was first launched, I decided to opt for the twist this time round, which brought out a more intense earthy, bitter undertone that I personally adore. As expected, the matcha flavour overwhelmed the royal milk tea, which was milkier. However, I still enjoyed this tea-riffic combination which provided a well balanced dimension of flavours - milky with a subtle floral fragrance coupled with an earthy bitter undertone 💚💛. [PS: Hopefully this can be a permanent flavour at the Cathay outlet, which I felt was a better substitute for Hokkaido milk? 🤔] .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#matchayasg #burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Quite sad to miss their Darker Than Dark limited flavour earlier, hope they bring it back soon, and pair it with mint too! 😋
If not then you should be game for some Darker than Dark Nama Chocolate soft serve 😜\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#matchayasg #icecream #softserve #namachocolate #namachocolateicecream #darkerthandarknamachocolate #dessert #dessertaddict #instafood #instadessert #eeeeeats #yum #drool #foodsg #foodfeed #feedfeed #foodforfoodies #dailyfoodfeed #foodaddict #sgeats #igsg #igfood #sgfoodie #foodblog #foodstagram #foodgasm #foodgawker #foodphotography #diningfoodprints #burpple

🍇🧀
The Soft Serve sweetness is just right with a slight lingering of savouriness. A Japanese Shoyu 醤油 that’s aged for 10 years was used, that’s where the umami savouriness comes from. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />To accompany the already great Soft Serve is the Mitarashi Dango, which sees 3 Skewered Shiratama 白玉団子 that’s glazed with Kuromitsu 黒蜜 Syrup and Aburi-ed. Soft &amp; chewy with a slight burnt aroma, makes it addictive alongside the soft serve. Available at the Icon Village Outlet. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #matchaya #matchayasg #ほうじ茶 #おいしい #きなこ #黒蜜 #sugarcakepie #MitarashiDango #mitarashi #dango #みたらし団子 #御手洗団子 #Shiratama #白玉団子 #mochi #Kuromitsu
with Mitarashi Soft Serve + Aburi Dango Shiratama
This flavour has the salted caramel notes, which complements perfectly in terms of sweetness, savoriness and creaminess. Paired with a skewer of aburi shiratama with kuromitsu syrup, this is a perfect complement to the soft serve.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />Address: 12, Gopeng Street, Icon Village, Unit 01-72, Singapore 078877\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #matchaya #matchayasg
Mitarashi Softserve with Aburi Shiratama coated in kuromitsu glaze and mitarashi ($7.90) - Once again, Matchaya does not fail in the slightest bit to deliver a brand new flavour of softserve that you probably cannot find elsewhere in Singapore! Also known as Japanese maple, the serve manages to please the tastebuds without being too sweet. Many have been comparing it to salted caramel but I personally find this to be much lighter than that, and definitely way more enjoyable than the former. I tend to not eat dango because of its lack of taste, but the coating of kuromitsu and mitarashi makes it such an enjoyable treat! I love that it is not too chewy as well and surprisingly easy to bite.
But it’s time to move on!! Looking forward to try the autumn offerings 😊
This was absolutely yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />The matcha warabi mochi, shiratama, azuki, rice puffs and brown sugar tea jelly, together with the homemade matcha sauce, gave the soft serve an amazing taste and texture.\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @veronicaphua for introducing us to this unique soft serve. I would say that this is probably the best soft serve I\'ve had in Singapore.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_matchaya #matchayasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Thick and creamy soft serve made from roasted soyabean flour is what I need right now to cool myself down from the sweltering heat. When you are at it, I highly recommend you add a serving of warabi mochi at $1.50 for 2 pieces as it goes so well with the kinako.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Matchaya\n<br />Address: 12, Gopeng Street, Icon Village, Unit 01-72, Singapore 078877\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #matchaya #matchayasg
As my Ever so trusty Dinning companion @alhsx said. At first the sudden lavender hits you like a speeding lavender container truck.

Couldn\'t resist the allure of delicate and floral lavender flavour which is always so soothing for me. Will probably not get the parfait version next time because the azuki, rice puffs and brown sugar jelly way overwhelmed the lavender flavour. Would recommend a more \"neutral\" topping like the chewy shiratama dango to go with it.\n<br />.\n<br />#lavender #softserve #parfait #japanesedesserts #matchayasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm #sgcafehopping

Creamy and nutty Kinako (Roasted Soybean) - a lil bit too sweet for my liking is a perfect match to the ever awesome Matcha soft serve plus the addition of Warabimochi, Shiratama Dango, and the crunchy roasted puffed rice..

😻😻😻 Do not know which combi is my fav now cause I love every combi they come up with 🤤 wonder what\'s next week\'s mystery flavour 🤔
It complements their classic Matcha soft serve beautifully, giving one of the best combos of Japanese flavours 😋 #thisCuriousCraving #epicuration #burpple
Pristine white Hokkaido milk softserve. Smooth and silky with a fluid and flowy consistency. Slightly sweeter than its green counterpart, the matcha. Black sesame sauce, made from 2 types of sesame seeds was thick but yet not gooey. So jet black and a glossy finish. Is this the new sexy black?\n<br />◾◽\n<br />I am not a big fan of sesame. But this sauce was not overpowering. No sugar was added thereby the milky softserve sweetness was toned down. A choice of having both milk and matcha in a cup. I chose milk because then one can savor the legit white creamy goodness.\n<br />◽◾\n<br />Thank you @kevincheejy @matchayasg for remembering me. Wonderful time chitchatting with you.
Will work for soft serves. 🍦 #foodporn #burpple #matchayasg #sgeats

Instead of the dual swirl, we got ourselves half kuri (chestnut) and hal matcha softserve. I really enjoyed the nutty slightly sweet marron chestnut flavour —  a perfect pairing to the bitter matcha. The rum-soaked chestnut chunks served as a good constrast in texture to the chestnut puree and @matchayasg\'s typical butter biscuit.\n<br />But I\'m excited to wait for their next creative invention!\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #icecream #food #dessert #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat

Travelled all the way to Tanjong Pagar for this matcha softserve, and it didn\'t disappoint! Though it was pricey, $5.90 for a cup of softserve, it was a great TGIF treat! The matcha taste was distinct, and softserve was very smooth. You can tell it\'s the real,pure stuff as it doesn\'t melt easily. The size is just right for a sweet treat-not too overwhelming. The biscuit was crisp and it went well with the softserve. Only qualm is there\'s no seating available, so you have to stand and eat😂 Authentic Matcha softserve👍🍦
Every bite into it has that roasty aromatic perfuming the whole enjoyment.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #matchaya #blacksesame #tart

Have the dual swirl of goma &amp; hojicha then! Perfect match, so rich &amp; fragrant. Happy to return, still my favourite😍💚 #burpple
Was close by and decided to pop by @matchayasg at icon village to try their matcha-black sesame twist soft-serve ($6.50) 😍😍 I\'m in love! Just had to come this weekend as they Hv new Flavours next week.. Worth the trip here #slurp #burpple #thisislunch
What a perfect match💕 Keep it up #matchayasg !! #sgfoodporn #sgfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgig #igsg #iweeklyfood #8dayseat #instafoodsg #instadaily #matcha #icecream #softserve #sgdessert #dessertporn #dessertsg #foodsg #foodiesg #foodporn #foodspotting #hungrygowhere #burpple #sgcafes #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #openricesg #whati8today
Matcha milk tea was pretty good as well but finish it asap! Once it gets diluted, it\'s really, really bland #burpplecheapngood
The bitterness is in every scoop, but don\'t be discouraged \'cos it\'s creamy enough to make your matcha ice cream a worthwhile experience! 😜😋💕 #icecreamisbae #matcha #matchaicecream #matchayasg #burpple #simplejoys #ohyeahmonday #harirayahaji

🍵 💚 Possibly the best matcha soft serve ($5.90) in SG. It\'s not the sweetened kind, just very rich in green tea taste! 😋👍🏻 #singapore #igsg #sgig #icecream #cafehop #sgcafe #instatravel #foodporn #foodgasm #instagood #instafood #photography #photooftheday #travel #travelgram #bbctravel  #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfoodie #explore #matcha #gelato #softserve #greentea  #sgcafehop #chill #tgif

Still rich and lipsmacking good!
Each macaron is $3 and the flavours available are yuzu, rose lychee, black sesame, hojicha, matcha and chocolate.
Hang on.. would you pay $8 for a life changing matcha ice cream, 1/2 of it covered with black molasses and houjicha feuilletine dip, the other 1/2 with matcha dip with toasted sesame on top, that gives you that satisfying crunch and punch with every bite? #yaaaaas #takemymoney!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#matcha #matchalover #matchaicecream \n<br />#greentea #icecream #matchayasg #dessert #sweet #dessertporn #syxxeats #burpple #cafe #cafesg #chill #eatoutsg #food #foodie #foodonfoot #foodphotography #foodpics #foodporn #foodspotting #instafood #nomnom #sgfood #singapore #yummy #sogood
Mmmmm… Magically dusted with Houjicha powder, this creamy soft serve sure packs a robust punch filled with pleasant roasted tea fragrance. Perfectly harmonized, the buttery biscuit served together also adds texture and does help a little to further balance the intense bitter nutty undertone of Houjicha!\n<br />.\n<br />[Psst: Matchaya is currently serving Matcha Soft Serve till Sunday 7 August ]

Given that hojicha ice cream is a rarity in Singapore, rest assured that the quality lives up to its $8 price tag for the upsized version\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #hungrygowhere #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #8dayseat #sgig #igsg #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #burpple #burpplesg #exsgcafes #setheats #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodsteps #sgmakandiary #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #exploresingapore #sgigfood #singaporeinsider #tslmakan
Fun fact: Hojicha is roasted green tea while Matcha is finely-ground green tea powder 🍵 Matchaya serves only one of the two flavours on a weekly rotation basis!\n<br />•\n<br />#whati8today #exploresingapore #foodiesg #8dayseat #sgfoodie #iweeklyfood #foodstagram #foodporn #burpple #hungrygowhere #hojicha #softserve #icecream #matchaya #iconvillage #japanesedesserts #japdesserts #japsweets #japfood #japfoodsg
Love the rich and aromatic texture but I recommend sharing as it can be too heavy for one.
If u r a matcha lover, u gotta love this. its not like those sweet matcha soft serve but it\'s the bitter type which has the legit matcha taste; $5.90 for this cup n I think it\'s a great exposure compared to the usual sweet matcha that we have 
Had the green tea soft serve, soft swiss roll with hojicha filling and the MATCHAAAA latte- which is the richest in flavour out of the 3 we ordered and it\'s really perfect for a rainy day like this 😌☔️☔️ matcha love for this tho the price is a bit steep for the serving 🍵🍵 #matchaya #matcha  #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #tslmakan #sgeats #burpple #burpplesg #exploresingapore #igsg #onthetable #whati8today
More of this please for me 😋
Pardon this not so nice pic... Took it in a rush before I left home cos I overslept today😂😂
Side track to this Cha Cha Pop [$8] from the collaboration of @nehnehpopsg and @matchayasg 😍😍😍\n<br />Best thing ever! Just take my money! 😂
4.90/cup for iced matcha
$5.90 for the soft serve, and i heard they have option to upsize. Not very sure how much they charge extra for that.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Very \"pang\" (fragrant) and definitely intense, bittersweet, just like their matcha soft serve.

Matchaya items had never disappoint me. I want more!! 😄😋
In collaboration with @nehnehpopsg , here comes the Cha Cha Pop that makes you dance Cha Cha after eating it! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻Matcha ice cream with matcha and Houjicha shell, black molasses , feuilletine and toasted sesame ! Very yummy but a little too sweet for me!\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #matcha #matchayasg
◾◽◾\n<br />Under the Neh Neh Pop brolly ... 1st bite for me was pretty sweet. After biting into the matcha shell, a black layer was exposed which I think it is the molasses. Then comes the pleasant surprise. The matcha ice cream which was surprisingly not too sweet. There was a slight bitter aftertaste.\n<br />◽◾◽\n<br />If you love everything matcha, this would be like matcha heaven on a stick. \n<br />Dainty little finger : me😇
Thick rich creamy matcha soft serve ftw! TGIF! Enjoy your weekend ! Btw they are selling Houjicha now! 🙆🏻\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #matcha #matchayasg

It is less creamy, less sweet and the green tea taste is pretty dominant here. It is good &amp; smooth! 👍🏻\n<br />🔸\n<br />You can pair it up with a shot of green tea espresso ($2.10) or like me, i decided to drink the shot just on its own. It really \"Znggg\" me up!

Kudos to #matchaya\'s striving efforts from a pop up store to a legit holding ground at Icon Village which is only 5mins from my office 😂. Cha Cha Pop by Neh Neh ($8) was a huge and a heavy pop, my fingers was feeling tired holding it lol. Matcha and hojicha flavor infused with crunchy waffle-like biscuit for it\'s crust coating. Shall go ahead with their other choices if i got the time. \n<br />#whati8today #burpple #8dayseat #matchaya #tagforlikes #japanesefood #matcha #sgfood #sgfoodie #nehnehpop #chachapop #delicious #hojicha #greentea #icepop #icecream
Matcha and Houjicha overloaded on a Sunday! Do pop by for their new item- matcha Mont Blanc petite tarts which are made by their talented Chef who never disappoints when it comes to dessert! Crunchy caramelised cocoa nibs atop smooth matcha chestnut swirls with a chunky roasted chestnut placed nicely on a moist matcha almond frangipane base ! This bite size yummy dessert just made me want to have more ! 😍\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #hojicha #matchayasg

Favourite for me with the Yuzu, refreshing, sweetness is well balanced with interestingly Yuzu peel centre 😋

The sugar level in the tea is minimal, thus not overly sweet.
Matchaya freshly brew their tea lattes! Comes in 4 flavours; matcha, houjicha (roasted green tea), kuromitsu (brown sugar), Japanese milk tea, and at $4.90 each!
😄

Japanese royal milk tea with the tea fragrance and flavour and not too sweet #yummy with my favourite japanese items ❤️\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #foodsg #foodstagram #foodcoma #foodgasm #foodporn #foodspotting #foodies #instadaily #instafood #igsgfood #instagramhub #jiaklocal #matchayasg #milktea #nomnnomnom #openricesg #potd #sgeats #sgig #sgfg #tslmakan #vscosg #vscofood #whati8today
