A huge slab of kimchi braised pork collar that is so irresistibly tender, served with a corn purée, watercress salad and radish. The Pig Bang will definitely send you straight to meat heaven due to its massive size, so it\'s best to share! This is part of Joo Bar\'s newly launched brunch menu that is available every Sunday 1130-1600.
Missing Sunday brunch at @joobarsg, which is quite the melting pot of Asian cuisines and flavours. Think Burmese fried chicken, Indian-inspired cauliflower fritters in tempura batter, braised kimchi pork collar, and deconstructed salmon Wellington with seaweed and ikura.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Of everything we were fed today by chefs @datbearchef and @paulchong28, the Hakuna Moo-Tartare has got to be my favourite.\n<br />Ladies and gentlemen, ordinary beef tartare this ain\'t. Not when presentation has a theatrical flair (better standby that Boomerang!). And definitely not with the interesting touches it comes with.\n<br />For instance, mixed in with the chopped raw Korean beef are sweet pear and a 24-hour house-cured egg, while three saucers containing raw garlic purée, brown sugar and sesame oil are served alongside. These are to allow customers to season each bite to their own liking. Well, I discovered I actually enjoy beef tartare more with sugar.\n<br />Do note this wittily-named creation is available only on Sundays for brunch at @JooBarSg (11.30am to 4pm).
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />What\'s better than potatoes? Why, Porktatoes of course!\n<br />Baby potatoes are cooked confit-style in Mangalitsa pork fat, then lavished with squiggles of anchovy emulsion for some amazing flavoured carbs (please wipe that drool off your chin 😜).\n<br />P.S. Do note Joo Bar serves this only at their Sunday Brunch, from 11.30am to 4pm.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Guess what? There\'s no need to fly around to enjoy the cuisine from the ASEAN countries when you can go over to @JooBarSg on Sundays for their brand new brunch.\n<br />Inspired by their multi-national team, the dishes created by Head Chef @datbearchef and Sous Chef @paulchong28 reflect different countries of origin in the region but with a unique \"cafe twist\".\n<br />First up, and in tribute to their brand heritage, was this Bull-gogi Ssam ($26++), a Korean take on the classic Sunday roast. \n<br />The thick slices of Argentinian grass-fed beef were tender and I really liked how they tasted wrapped in lettuce with the housemade kimchi and chimichurri. Interestingly, the latter\'s made of roasted leeks and spring onions which is a departure from the norm but no less appetising.
Looking through my feed, @joobarsg Joo Wings ain\'t doing me no good.
Very value for money-oozey egg atop purple rice(carbs), plus choice of meat and 3 ingredients. I went with beef bulgolgi, which was tender and flavourful, and carrots, cucumber and marinated spinach, all of which were very fresh and added nice crunch! I especially like the spinach-all in all, a very wholesome and hearty meal!
We had double of this as it was 1 for 1 promotion. Makgeolli overdose!! House Brew Organic Makgeolli, Yucha Makgeolli Slush, Passionfruit Makgeolli, Blood Orange Makgeolli, Lychee Makgeolli. So which one is your favorite? My love goes to Lychee 😘\n<br />🍶
Both bibimbaps were great to have; the white rice bowl tasted more original with its sweetness and spiciness from the gochujang, while the quinoa bowl slanted towards being more savoury!
Potatoes fried in the flavorful fat from the confit of mangalitsa pork and anchovy emulsion. \n<br />New Sunday brunch menu from @JooBarSG.\n<br />Available only on Sundays from 12-4pm. .\n<br />Thanks @joobarsg for having us!
Love the aesthetics and flavour of the dish, and the thickness of the pork collar. Spiciness is pretty mild as well, good for people with low heat tolerance like me.
It\'s a little too fatty for my liking. But, I adore that spring onions salad!!!!
Flavourful but I still prefer to have a whole piece of meat.

so i jooed, like finally. crowd favourite, honey butter chicken ($18) was indeed interesting but stopped at wowing me over. glazed toppokki was like tibits crisp outside, but ever the chewy still on the inside. smells real good too. really good beer snack but that\'s about it too. my view

Will be nice to enjoy the Design-Your-Own Bibimbap for lunch.
What I love about this dish is that the meat is solid! And with the gochujang sauce slathered over it, it was a delicious meal to go with the makgeolli though I think beer would be a better choice for this dish. I hear their bibimbap promotion for lunch is a good deal. Too bad I don\'t work nearby if not it would be one of my fave lunch spots.
Is one dish I\'ll love going back for. Chicken tenders, tteokbokki and garlic cloves generously glazed with honey butter but not overly sweet. Just can\'t get enough of those fried tteokbokki!
Picking one carb, one protein, three complements before choosing either original sauce (slightly spicy) or soy sauce. Interestingly they have Quinoa as a carb option, which is a great alternative to white rice but not found in traditional Korean dishes. Served on the hot plate, sizzling sound of bibimbap just make you want to mix it up and dig in quickly!
🍚\n<br />If you are thinking of what to eat for lunch around Bugis, you could consider the DIY Bibimbap from @joobarsg\n<br />🍚\n<br />Served in a sizzling hot stone pot to keep your bibimbap warm for longer, this is a yummy and filling lunch option. And if you make the right choices, it could be a healthy lunch too!\n<br />🍚\n<br />Prices start from SGD 10.90 for white/purple rice, runny egg + 1 protein + 3 complements + 1 sauce of your choice. \n<br />You can also add on extra or premium carbo (quinoa), proteins (steak) and complements (spam) at additional charge. But unless you intend to share, don\'t get carried away adding extra items! The price can add up and you might not be able to finish too! IMO, the basic combi should suffice for one person.\n<br />🍚\n<br />Featured: Quinoa &amp; Egg + 2 Proteins (Chicken &amp; Argentina Grassfed Steak) + 4 Complements (Kimchi, Pickled Radish, Spam &amp; Sautéed Mushroom), SGD 27.90 - Good for two to share\n<br />🍚\n<br />Remember to #eatsnapgive too!\n<br />🍚\n<br />Joo Bar\n<br />5 Tan Quee Lan Street\n<br />5.30pm to 12am\n<br />+65 8138 1628\n<br />😋\n<br />#freewifisg and #pokestop available too!
Or have a meal with your drink?\n<br />🍶\n<br />According to @joobarsg Koreans tend to do the latter, making alcohol the main course instead! I may not be brought up this way but I began to understand after my meal at Joo Bar tonight.\n<br />🍶\n<br />No, it\'s not because their food are bad. While it\'s true that I found their sides a little too sweet for my liking, I think they do a good bibimbap (more about it tomorrow). But their Yucha Makgeolli Slush (SGD 22-Small, SGD 36-Large) left the deepest impression on me.\n<br />🍶\n<br />Though it is a slush, the texture is smooth and creamy. Slightly sweet with a distinct yuzu taste, this rice wine left no bitter aftertaste, making it a really enjoyable drink for non drinkers like me. One of us even commented that it tastes like Yoghurt based Bubble Tea! If you come to Joo Bar, this is a must try!\n<br />🍶\n<br />Sincere thanks to @joobarsg for hosting us tonight and &amp; special thanks to @nahmj for asking me along! 😘\n<br />🍶\n<br />Joo Bar\n<br />5 Tan Quee Lan Street\n<br />5.30pm to 12am\n<br />+65 8138 1628\n<br />😋\n<br />#freewifisg and #pokestop available too!
Looking at the fat to meat ratio, I know I was in for a treat. Packed with flavour, Joo Bar’s Grilled Mangalista Belly ($25) was real indulgent. The fatty, FATTY grilled pork belly was moist, tender and slightly sweet - just so good as the fat literally melted in the mouth. Served with a side of chive salad, the thickly cut meat was topped with bits of crisp garlic chips which added a nice fragrance and ‘umami’ dimension. Already addictive, can you imagine how much more it would be washed down with a glass of makgeolli?
Thick cut pork belly, topped with crisp garlic chips. Now, I dislike garlic but this worked. One bite into this VERY FATTY Mangalitsa, all my diet motivations went out the window. Some may feel that there needs to be a little more meat - the ratio of meat to melt-in-the-mouth fat is sinfully good (bad, I mean bad). Juicy, tender, and talk about umami. Definitely my favourite of the night!
Build and design your own perfect bibimbap for lunch today at Joo Bar!
Best paired with either Soju or Beer, the L.A. Style Black Angus Kalbi is possibly the side that enticed your palette for more! The dish consists  of black angus bone in short rib, marinated in soy &amp; topped with shiitake &amp; scallion. Every mouthful oozes of umami flavors, leaving you wanting to go for seconds, thirds &amp; possibly a fourth if your pocket could handle it.
Great place for Korean food and cocktails!
Choice of Argentinean grass-fed beef steak, bulgogi pork, bulgogi beef, spicy chicken or broiled saba. You get to even choose the kinds of rice. White, Purple or Quinoa.\n<br />.\n<br />Location: 5 Tan Quee Lan Street, Singapore 188094\n<br />.\n<br />#joobarsg #joobar #burpple #burpplesg
3.5 munchies: Stir-fried in gochujang and glazed with honey, the chicken tenders were juicy on the inside and had a light crisp on the outside. Topped with garlic, chopped nuts and scallion, it also comes with topokki for added QQ texture. Go for the Honey Butter Chick if you prefer your fried chicken sweeter and more savoury like I do.
On the table, we have 3 customised Bibimbap. How cool is that when you get to choose your favourite:\n<br />- type of rice (white/purple rice)\n<br />- type of meat (chicken/pork/beef)\n<br />- type of veggie (more than 10 types)\n<br />- type of sauce (Original/Soy)
First off, they nailed their wings. Mighty crisp on the outside, even when glazed, and so so moist and juicy on the inside, to the extent that a friend commented how its texture was akin to steamed fish — it was THAT moist. The spicy and sweet soy glaze was a nicely done too, adding tons of flavours without causing the skin to get soggy. Execution 👍🏻 taste 👍🏻 satisfaction 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
From $10.90, you can choose one base, one protein, and 3 toppings such as kimchi, sautéed mushrooms and Korean radish. (Top up more for more toppings!) And when it\'s served to you sizzling hot, mix it all up and enjoy your own creation of Bibimbap!
There lunch menu was mainly bibimbap and some sides (chicken wings were goooood!!) really good and simple Korean food tho 😌
Speaking of twos, every single small refill of a side dish and every iced water is priced at $2 respectively - kinda ridiculous when we are paying a lot for food and drinks #makgeolli #burpple #hateplacesthatchargeforwater @shuperduperrr
Went to joo bar for the first time tonight &amp; it was actually fully booked for the night, so had no choice but to sit at the bar counter. Ordered the 딲간쩡 (sweet &amp; spicy chicken) &amp; the kimchi pork stew! Both dishes were very appetizing &amp; up to standard. Tasted quite authentic &amp; went well with our makgeolli (Korean rice wine). Joo bar is known for their makgeolli &amp; sure enough, it did not disappoint. Would definitely head back for more makgeolli &amp; drinking snacks! 
Seafood Rapokki (S$22), Spam fries (S$14), Tofu Chips (S$14), Makgeolli Sampler (S$35) - when you can\'t decide which one to try, go for alllll of them!! *hic* Pretty satisfying, hearty dinner at Joo Bar after watching《寒战2》\"Cold War 2\" movie - ooh and Aaron Kwok is as suave as ever! 😍😍😍
A veritable seafood feast lying in wait under a bubbling, piping hot sweet and spicy gochujang based stew and stringy, chewy mozarella. Dig in to discover ramyeon, toppokki, shrimp clam, black mussel, and squid simmering under the rich and deeply umami sauce. I\'m heading back just to order this.
When we were at Joo Bar for a staff farewell lunch today, my lucky tastebuds got a spontaneous sneak preview of a NEW dessert that\'ll be launched tomorrow.\n<br />Chef Nathaniel\'s expertise in incorporating salty Korean bean paste into a classic French dessert made this strike a good balance between sweet and savoury. Furthermore, the egg custard beneath the caramelised crisp surface was fanatically smooth and soft.\n<br />Make sure you save space for this.
Yesterday\'s lunch was the personalised Bibimbap from Joo Bar because I had been thinking of eating it again for goodness knows how long! On this visit, I created mine with purple rice adorned with tender chunks of spicy chicken, minced kimchi, Korean beansprouts, sweet corn and a soy dressing which was served on the side. Still can\'t believe this huge portion (which comes in a massive heavy iron bowl that keeps the food warm for longer) only cost me $10.90++! 😄😄
5 munchies: All my favourite ingredients are hidden under that slab of melted mozzarella – ramyeon, topokki, shrimp, clams, mussels, squid, and Korean fishcake. The sweet and spicy gochujang-based sauce for the stew was so rich, so tasty. I went to seventh heaven after having this with Joo Bar\'s warm kimchi with mangalista pork belly and a jug of organic makgeolli!

Ramyeon, topokki and lots of seafood in a sweet and spicy gochujang-based stew. I like how it\'s more watery than other rapokkis that I\'ve had so it doesn\'t get gelat! The abundance of seafood also enhanced its flavor profile. And lastly, topping it off with some stringy melted cheesy mozzarella!
Invitingly seared and tender bone in short rib coated in a salty sweet soy marinade and scallions that\'s just begging to be eaten with your hands.
The borderline cloying honey butter glazed chicken tenders were unexpectedly superseded by the sideshow of topokki which assumed their super saiyan form of an incisingly crackly exterior whilst being enjoyably chewy within.
So addictive with the thick cut grilled mangalitsa pork belly, chive salad and especially those garlic chips. Get me a jug of that yucha makgeolli and I can snack on these the entire night.
Indulgently fatty thick cut slices of premium pork belly that practically melt in your mouth. Nice touch with the garlic chips that add a crisp pungency to the affair, although I found myself wishing the lean meat to fat ratio was leaning(pun intended) a little more toward the former.\n<br />-\n<br />This was a hosted tasting by @joobarsg, thanks @geekyelephant for the invite!
Sweet and tender bite sized morsels of gochujang and honey coated chicken tenders. By its appearance alone I was anticipating the crunch of what one expects of Korean fried chicken, and was slightly disappointed when expectations weren\'t met.
2am cravings for crispy fried chicken wings—tender flesh and a spicy + sweet soy glaze… Will go to sleep dreaming of fried chicken…\n<br />Joo Bar ‣ 5 Tan Quee Lan St., Singapore 188094\n<br />#JooBarSG
This time serving pocket-friendly yet healthy at the same time (look at that huge serving!!). From prices starting at $10.90, choose a grain, a protein (I greedily had 2, with a top up), various toppings which you want to place into your customised Bibimbap - say yay to all your favourite ingredients! \n<br />This is so good that I need not add in the accompanying sauce (soy/gochujang) and finished it clean (pun not intended 🙊). Thank you for the filling healthy lunch @joobarsg and @geekyelephant for extending the invite! 🙆🏻
So many options to choose from including purple rice and quinoa as your carbohydrate. Protein options include spicy chicken, beef bulgogi or meat lovers can top up for Argentinian Grassfed Steak. Then make your bibimbap colourful and even more delicious with toppings like kimchi, pickled radish, edamame and sauteed mushrooms.\n<br />Plus Joo\'s a nice quiet place to escape the heat for lunch—air-conditioning, free wifi, customisable bibimbap… and super close to Bugis MRT.\n<br />Thanks to @joobarsg for feeding us well as usual. 😋\n<br />TGIF!!!\n<br />#JooBarSG #Bibimbap
Get creative with Joo Bar\'s new Design Your Own Bibimbap menu during lunch time! \n<br />Choose from white rice, purple rice or quinoa for your carbohydrate. Then, select 1 protein (top up of $1.50 for Saba and $4.50 for grass fed beef), 3 complements (additional serving from $1-$1.50) and 1 sauce (additional serving for $0.50). I had such a tough time picking out which ingredients would go best together and ultimately decided on this beef bulgogi &amp; Argentina grass fed beef white rice bibimbap. I also particularly enjoyed the kimchi, Korean bean sprouts and pickled radish as complements. \n<br />Unlike other bibimbaps, a savoury soy sauce is available if you prefer that over gochujang. Lastly, give everything a good mix before you dig in! 
\nI can be very picky about certain things so it feels great when I have a chance to mix and match a dish according to my preference. Joo Bar\'s newly-launched customisable bibimbap is the perfect opportunity to do just that. As they offer about 20 types of ingredients, designing a Korean rice bowl that\'s uniquely suited to my taste was a cinch.  
Generously served with shrimp, black mussel, clam and squid. Though the base was supposed to be red pepper paste, it tasted more like any tomato based risotto:(
Rappoki and seafood pancake with cheese (like Korean pizza) was soooo good. The honey makgeoli was divine!! 
fork it in, twirl and pull. then it goes into your happy belly.
Shrimp, black mussel, clam and squid tossed in lime, crushed black pepper and kimchi jus. Served with house-made tofu chips.

Ramyeon. Cheese. Seafood. Toppoki. Tasty gochujang-base(?) that wasn\'t too spicy. Reminds me of budae jiggae, only better. Damn shiok! If this doesn\'t count as comfort food I don\'t know what does. My only gripe is .. MORE CHEESE PLZ IDK WHERE ALL THE CHEESE WENT \n<br />Came here for an impromptu date night. Joo bar is a great place to chill, with good food, great homemade organic makgeoli, and we ended up having a long chat with the Taiwanese intern/bartender/waiter about food, to his life story. I love encounters like these mostly because I\'m kpo about everyone\'s story HAHA💁🏻. \'Twas a fun night!

Beneath a generous amount of cheese are the regular patrons of Korean cuisines: rice cake, ramyeon, seafood, not to forget, the Korean chili sauce. The bowl is surprisingly addictive and goes well with the sojurita. Banger and mash is just what it is, I\'d suggest to go for other dishes (cues Kimchi Mac and Cheese) instead.
Instead of having you pour the shot glass of soju into a glass of beer, they put the bottle of beer into the glass of flavored soju. You\'d have to drink a few mouthful of the soju and they\'d push the bottle of beer upside down into your glass. Do not attempt to remove the bottle of beer because the alcoholic liquid would flow out and fill the glass (because my friend did and thankfully, our glass wasn\'t full and I stopped her in time before it overflowed). This is good for three to share if you\'re not a big drinker.
Ramyeon + Toppoki = Seafood Roppoki ($22)\n<br />Although it\'s a tad salty but it\'s darn good! 👅💦💦💦\n<br />.\n<br />Download @holler.out app and quote \'zanthrea\' to get 10% off for min spending of $120.\n<br />.\n<br />JOO BAR PTE LTD\n<br />5 Tan Quee Lan Street Singapore 188094\n<br />Operating hours:\n<br />1130am till 230pm (last order at 2pm) and 530pm till 12mn (last order at 1130pm)
Good textures and flavors run high in this twist of the classic French dish. Chili and tobiko add an interesting kick of Asian spice and crunch, making for an ideal bar bite or appetizer. 📷 @oliviagiroud
Why didn\'t I find this restaurant sooner? Love their food especially their Honey Butter Chick ($18) 🐔🍯.

Tender chunks of juicy chicken are glazed and re-glazed with honey butter, flecked with crunchy chopped nuts, and served with chewy rice cake for your optimum enjoyment – a definite crowd pleaser! 📷 @oliviagiroud
Pretty like each flavour esp lychee ones and except the strawberry (pink) which taste nth like strawberry.
Another great food they have. I love their honey butter chick ($18++) too. If u ask me to choose one only, I would take the chicks. Love their ambient and food but not the price here. Probably most Korean food are expensive. -M
Either u like it or hate it. And I like it.  Just wish that there\'s more tofu chips to go with the salsa. 😋 -M
Like a pot of treasure teeming with all sorts of goodies – shrimp, mussels, clams, Korean fishcake, rice cakes and QQ ramyun luxuriating in a rich gochujang-based sauce. And the best part? A blanket of cheese that melts into the stew, making it even more irresistible.
Light fried dish as appetiser, the mini sweet rice cake scattered around the main dish made it an interesting combination &amp; different texture when chewing! Its meant to be shared for 2! 
Nighttime craves for sticky glazed fried chicken – that Dak Kang Jung sauced up with gochujang, honey and garlic is my weakness – and a killer concoction of soju-margarita-beer.
So good and cheesy, I\'m feeling grate (great)!! #comfortfood
Holy Cheesus 😳😍🤗 .
Joobar always give me comfort food. Really love the atmosphere as we chill at that place too. However yesterday food tastes okay only, but food presentation is always awesome. Will I be back again? Yes, I will! I will give them another chance! 😁
Seafood Rapokki - Ramyeon, toppokki, shrimp, black mussels, clams, squid and all that cheese. ❤️ 
Possibly the best gourmet hotdog in town, featuring a thick, unctuous hand-chopped mangalitsa pork sausage that\'s glossy with honey-soy marinade. Cosily snuggled in a toasted brioche bun, the end bits of the sausage barely protrude from under a mouthwatering heap of kimchi wagyu chilli and melted mozzarella.
My favourite anju of chef\'s special tofu chips serve here as vessels for a tongue-tingling ceviche made with squid, black mussel, clam, shrimp, lime, crushed black pepper and kimchi juice.
Just look at that glossy glaze on the chicken. 😍 There\'s definitely more honey than butter in the sauce, because the floral taste of the honey is absolutely arresting – you\'ll either love it or hate it. Haven\'t heard anyone vote the latter, though.
Located away from the hustle and bustle of Bugis, Joo Bar is a modern Korean restaurant cum gastrobar perfect for a girls\' night out. The three-storey industrial-chic space on Tan Quee Lan Street brews its own makgeolli (rice wine), so it is a must to start your night with the Makgeolli Sampler ($35 for five) — flavours include strawberry, peach, yuzu, lychee and original. Don’t be fooled by its milky Yakult-like appearance — the drink contains six to eight percent alcohol, so pace yourself! Order some anju, Korean dishes that go well with alcohol. Both the Tofu Chips with Guacamole and Kimchi Salsa ($14) and the Warm Kimchi with Tofu and Spam ($14) are great options. If you\'d like something more substantial, order the Seafood Gochujang Risotto ($24) — it comes with generous portions of plump, juicy seafood like mussels, clams and prawns, and the spicy pepper paste cuts through the creaminess of the risotto perfectly. Keep the drinks flowing with the Yucha Sojurita ($28, enough for up to four people). The frozen concoction of soju, yucha, Cointreau and lemon juice comes with an overturned bottle of Hite beer plugged in the centre! Pro tip: For more privacy, ask to have the sliding doors shut around your table to create your own private room!
Suffice to say what I liked most in this Kimchi Chilli Cheese Dog (S$14++) was the sweet bun. The sausage was too loose and crumbly, kimchi wagyu chilli was forgettable, mozzarella is - well mozzarella. I didn\'t like the honey-soy flavouring of the sausage which left it a weird combination of too sweet with a mellowed savoury undertone. Sweet-ish sausage, sweet-ish just slightly spicy kimchi chilli, sweet bun = it all kinda blended together. I\'ve heard so much about Joo Bar I guess I had my hopes up way too high.
Had the Seafood Gochujang Risotto. The gochujang, a Korean fermented soybean chilli paste, added a pleasant tinge of spiciness and Asian flavour to the Italian rice dish; \'twas a good fusion. Also shared the Dak Kang Jung, Korean fried chicken tenders tossed in gochujang, honey, scallion, garlic and chopped nuts. The chickens were not soggy on the outside though they were coated in sticky sauce. Tender on the inside, they were greatly satisfying. Complimented our meal with some makgeolli, a light Korean rice wine. With native Koreans as waitresses, we were literally transported to Seoul. Prices might be a bit steep, but for the ambience and the good food they serve, it\'s definitely worth it.
We regretted for not ordering large ($36)! Joo Bar offers Yucha as the basic flavour but we decided to try the flavour of the day - Passion Fruit. It was so good! We should make beer, cider and most alcoholic drinks into slush. 😍
Chicken tenders stir-fried in gochujang and honey, topped with scallion, garlic and chopped nuts. By now, we know Joo Bar doesn\'t really serve spicy food. Good for those who love Korean food but can\'t take the hotness. I love this sweet and savory chicken tenders that has a light crisp on the outside and juicy meat inside. Enhanced with a tinge of spice, no wonder this is recommended to go with beer and/or soju. 👍
Joo Bar is one of the bars that serve quality mains and sides. We did find the price rather steep while flipping through the very interesting menu. This risotto was flavorful and savory due to the gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and broth. It was so creamy and buttery, but the punch of spiciness was weak and almost absent. Slight disappointment there. 
A seemingly simple dish, but this pancake was the BOMB and is now officially my favourite Korean pancake! I love the crispy texture of the pancake that is not overly thick, and the oozing cheese in every bite. 
Fusion at its best! I love risotto and this dish perfectly fuses risotto with Korean flavours. Generous with seafood (mussels, clams, prawns) and parmesan shavings, definitely a must try!
Decent Korean fried chicken with right crispness and sticky sweet. Perfect to go with drinks, here we had grape mojito, which tastes pretty good and refreshing. 
Coughing away but craving these addictive Honey Butter Chicks ($18) - inspired by the recent popular honey butter chips, these Chicken tenders and Toppikki are coated with honey butter glaze. The best part was definitely the rice cake, steamed and deep fried with the honey butter sauce - giving it a nice golden coating that has light crispy bite while the inside remained chewy and moist! Those spicy lover should adore the gochujang flavoured Dak Kang Jung ($18). These babies are best paired with their homemade Makgeolli on this Friday night!
Treat yourself this Friday afternoon to comforting pot of suuuper cheesy Seafood Rapokki ($22) - Ramyeon + Toppikki, tossed generously with shrimps, clam, black mussels and squids! The whole pot is then covered completely with lots and lots of mozzarella cheese! Best to combat the slight heat from the Rappoki soup base! This is heaven for spicy seafood cheese lover! 😻
Imagine lunch hour, sitting in air conditioned comfort, chowing down on this magnificent bowl of ramyeon, toppokki, shrimp, clam, black mussel, squid and the best part… it\'s topped with a layer of melted mozzarella!\n<br />#JooBarSG #JooBar *
This honey-soy mangalitsa sausage is made in-house at Joo and served with delicious creamy mash and kimchi.\n<br />#JooBarSG #JooBar #BangersAndMash *
It\'s either you love it or don\'t, but for me the succulent chicken breast stuffed with house-made kimchi and shiitake mushrooms makes this a very unique creation that is definitely worth a try. A trail of tomato ragout lined up around the roulade while cheese was sprinkled on top. It\'s like Christmas all over again.
But if I were to have these plates of gochujang and honey butter chicken tenders from @joobarsg placed in front of me, i\'d probably gobble them up and regret when I\'m 5kg heavier.\n<br />.\n<br />🚇 BUGIS (from downtown line easier, exit D). 5 Tan Quee Lan Street. Singapore 188094.
Delish fusion of east meet west. Traditional red hot pepper sauce used as the base of risotto, not too piquant but with the right spicy note to the palette. The seafood used were fresh, plump and succulent. Good ratio of seafood to rice. The texture of the risotto was done to perfection too, not too wet, not too dry but just a lil tiny winny of creaminess. A flavorsome plate of risotto! 
Love this simple starter that\'s great to share between friends to get the meal going. Lucky I don\'t work near Bugis, or I\'d want to go to Joo for lunches!\n<br />Thanks to @juliuslim for the invite and @joobarsg for hosting the meal!\n<br />#JooBar #JooBarSG
Need I say more? Hand chopped mangalitsa pork sausages that has been marinated in honey-soy coated with a kimchi wagyu chilli and served in a brioche bun. Mozzarella was then added to the top and melted to elevate the dish further.
A cold appetizer that\'s so refreshing to the palate that it opens your tummy and prepares it for the mains later. Generous amount of shrimps, black mussels, clams and squids swimming in a tangy mixture of lime, crushed pepper and kimchi jus just makes you wanna grab the house-made tofu chips on the side and eat them together.
A medley of mushrooms such as enoki, shiitake and King oyster served in a casserole, mixed with house-made garlic butter. This was just soooo good.
Made from mangalitsa pork, Joo has recently introduced Joo Dogs, a Korean-style hotdog marinated in honey soy, enclosed in a sausage casing, all made in-house. When grilled, the mangalitsa hotdog comes in a nicely charred, smokey flavour while retaining a crunchy texture. This plate consists of a Joo Dog, creamy mash topped with chopped kimchi and a side of mustard.
One potential food coma inducing dish is the Seafood Rapokki ($22). Consisting of ramyeon, toppokki, shrimp, clam, black mussel and squid, this is a cauldron of extreme comfort levels. Oh, and how can I forget about the stretchy gooey mozzarella that magically makes everything so much better. You definitely do not want your boss to see you eating this for lunch.
When you are served with chicken tenders coated with gochujang sauce, you can literally hear the bar calling out to you to grab a drink to go with this wonderfully executed plate of meat.
One of the starters for the newly launched lunch menu at Joo Bar. The finally chopped tuna sits atop a mixture of smashed avocado, cucumber, onion, chilli and horse radish. Some lime zest was added to give it a tang while tobiko and cilantro are as the finishing touches.
😒 so here you go, straight out of the new menu of @joobarsg - Seafood Rapokki ($22). Think everything delicious baked with mozzarella cheese.
@joobarsg Kimchi Cheese Hotdog with homemade sausage made from hand chopped mangalitsa pork and seasoned with special honey soy marinade is defintely on the top of my choice. So so goooooooooddddd 😋😋😋😋\n<br />Quote my name \"Hannah\" when you use @holler.out to get 10% off the bill above $120. Cheers to the first fantastic weekend of the 2016! 🎉👏🎉

loved that crispy topokki which took away my heart. part of @joobarsg new menu
FAVOURITE KOREAN FOOD PLACE I\'m not kidding guys this is a must try!!!! this is the seafood kimchi risotto and it is SUPER delicious!! creamy rice with bits of crunchy kimchi and fresh seafood mm we also got the kimchi mac n cheese ($14) which had a unique twist to the usual mac n cheese!!! :- ) for drinks we had the makgeolli slush ($36) in the flavor of the day which happened to be passionfruit IT WAS AWESOMEEEEEE slight acidity from the passionfruit and hint of alcohol mashed into a icy slush it was perfectttttTtTtTtT 
Mmm.
It smothers you, douses you and beats you over the head with the fragrance-inclined tail of its cheesetastic agenda, but fan or not of cheese, it’s unequivocally the best pick from the lunch menu – the sweet and spicy kimchi aspect is pretty legit with the cabbage bits providing a toothy crunch factor, and the Mangalitsa belly, despite staying relatively grey in the sea of red, always remains on the right side of fatty bom bom. 3.8/5
Seafood gochujang risotto is love 😍... Feel like going back soon just to have this again hehe. Very filling though so it\'s good to share~ and save space for other dishes like their mangalitsa pork 😍😍😍
Joo Bar\'s signature is the Mangalitsa Pork, so there is no surprise for including it in their lunch menu items such as this one. Loved the deep sweet Gochujang flavours that is marinated into the meat, which was lean yet tender. Sitting on a bed of kimchi, the kimchi was on the sweeter side; so good I would not mind having it as banchan! Did not quite like the poached egg which was no doubt flowy but carried a strong vinegar flavour, and found the rice slightly dry, but I did really liked how they included lightly-battered fried onion rings for a crunch.
Everything\'s SO GOOD, pork cheese onion and everything. Hit me with another makgeolli too! 😛🍼
Joo Bar is all about their Mangalitsa Pork, and they have also included it in their newly-launched lunch menu. This item was probably the most well-rounded main course we had tried; gooey, stringy melted cheese covering kimchi-flavoured rice which was moist, but not overly wet that carried generous chunks of fatty, crisp Mangalitsa Pork Belly. Topped with a poached egg which flows perfectly, it also comes with the same crisp, lightly-battered fried onion rings which was really addictive.
Part of Joo Bar\'s newly-launched lunch menu. Seemingly deviating from the original idea, the pasta sauce seemed more like a spicy tomato base than kimchi despite having some bits of kimchi in the sauce itself. Prawns also felt a tad stiff and old. The Tobiko roe was a nice touch though, which added a popping sensation with every bite.
This probably not only makes for a good side for lunch but seemed to go well with drinks; chicken parts sparingly drizzled with a sweet and spicy soy glaze - subtle in its flavour yet crispy and juicy at the same time. The nuts added a crunch to the fried batter; pretty interesting.
Sigh.
[Joo Bar] We all know that the Koreans make awesome fried chicken which doesn\'t surprise me when Joo Bar\'s Joo Wings ($9) is available in the lunch and dinner menu.
[Joo Bar] Besides the Baked Mangalitsa Kimchi Rice ($16), you can also satisfy your mangalitsa craving when you order the Spicy Mangalitsa Deopbap ($16). 
Tastes average. Not worth eating unless you\'re hungry and need staples. 
This tasted ok. It is reasonable for a wings dish in terms of seasoning. Good as finger food to accompany your drinks. 
Tofu chips are really worth the eat. It tastes like nachos. Dips are kimchi and avocado - but not at all heavy. Light and yummy! 
Yucha Makgeolli Slush - tastes like snow ice that is Yuzu flavoured. Super good! 
[Joo Bar] Ever encountered a situation whereby it\'s time for luncheon but there are just too many choices to choose from in Bugis? Let me make your decision easier as Joo Bar has just launched a line-up of dishes, exclusive to the lunch menu, which promises to whet your appetite and make you come back for more. No longer just limited to their dinner menu, you can now have mangalitsa pork all day, every day, as they have incorporated this luxurious piece of meat into their dishes.
Great place for a chill out over some fusion Korean fare and their signature house brewed makgeolli. Loving those tofu chips, even better with kimchi/guac dips! #korean
It looks good tastes good, just a little small for my cravings! Teehee!
One of my favorites dish. It is simply delicious and insta-worthy.
The guys said there\'s better Korean wings out there than this. 
Love the Yuzu magoli slush is really good! We ordered a large one at $36 and shared amongst us! We also got the popular Yuzu sojurita! 
The guys didn\'t liked this. It said its a little muifan-ish. 
5 munchies: Absolutely loved this anju to kick start a high-quality Korean meal at this chic and tastefully designed bar. The spicy, salty and sour flavours all came together beautifully with the tender Mangalista pork belly, onions and scallions in the kimchi. I\'d highly recommend a jug of House Brew Organic Makgeolli to go with it.
This is ok but maybe cos it isn\'t Korean-tasting enough so it just didn\'t seem to go very well with our other dishes that night. 
Lacking the typical spiciness of gochujang sauce, this is quite mildly flavored and may come across as abit too bland. We improvised by mixing in a saltish sauce from one of our other side dishes, and the resulting taste was definitely more pleasing!
Drizzled in a garlicky sweet soy sauce that makes these crispy babies so incredibly delicious! Needless to say we stripped them down to nothing but bones, which we would gladly devour too if we could!
Said I would be back, and I did! This Yucha Sojurita has to be one of the most amazing drinks I\'ve had - purely the excitement of gushing down the cocktail while the beer is poured in to prevent it from overflowing is amazing enough. And that flavour...all my favorites in a drink! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
This is it, in all its glistening porcine glory.
I really, really like this place, from the cool designer-ish vibes to its innovative modern #Korean plates. Nearly everything we ordered here was deftly executed, this is fusion without the confusion. #takingbackfusion
Joo has been nothing short but absolutely amazing, Mangalista Pork Belly has always been my all time favorite and definitely an item you should not miss when you are in Joo.
200g portion of thick cut pork belly is first brined with salt, pepper, soju and makgeolli, before being steam-roasted for almost three hours. The meat was tender and flavorful from slow roasting with a nice crisp edge and best served with dijon mustard and chilli-seasoned chives to cut through its delicious fattiness.
Anyone who does a fantastic job with beef short ribs gets my vote.🙌🏻 #Burpple
Their wingz are really good! Share the seafood risotto as it feels really thick. Eel paper was so so, tho quite interesting
REALLY. Lost 3kg, I need some now. 😂 #JooBarSG #FatFatMeatSeries #JooBar #OngsLaiJiak #TheThreeLittleOinks #Keto
This is for kimchi lovers! Addictively tangy and spicy, this stew with sliced pork belly and loads of crunchy vegetables whets the appetite and leaves you wanting more. 
Tastes quite similar to their seafood risotto except more tomato-y. This gets my vote between the two because the shrimp in here are so huge and fresh!
The nutty bits on the top with the savory seasoning. Really good Bar Food. .\n<br />|\n<br />It was slightly salty but together with a cup of their drinks, it was perfect.
This yuzu flavored makgeolli slush is plain awesome! Refreshing, sweet, and with just a hint of alcohol, it\'s perfect for someone like me who doesn\'t really take well to the taste of alcohol
|\n<br />I don\'t really understand the purpose with that small candle fire. Served on a piping hot Claypot will be better.
|\n<br />Generous portion of seafood with tomato based risotto. However, I couldn\'t taste the sweetness from the seafood. Conclusion: I had better ones.
|\n<br />Boiled with Doenjang (Fermented Bean Paste). The waiter kindly told us that it must be eat with their pickled white cabbage and spicy radish salad. .\n<br />|\n<br />The crispy cabbage acted with a wrap and the spicy radish salad refreshed the entire palate.
A warm gooey mess of melted cheese, mini sized macaroni and kimchi-infused cream sauce. Pretty good!
Very crispy and makes a nice snack to go along with our drinks, albeit a little too salty
Wagyu bombs! It\'s da bombz, ready to explode with gastronomical pleasure! 
A kg of US Prime Ribeye done to perfection. Only available via preorder!
It\'s what I needed after a super busy and stressed out week. 4 more days till my long awaited break.
Deep fried baby Eel with chili salt and lime zest. A unique taste. 😋
Some bar bites for dinner tonight. Slow roasted mangalista, joo wings and baby eel paper. I think my favourite out of the 3 is the joo wings. It has a nice panko crumbs crust with the right amount of herbs and spice. The slow roasted pork belly had the potential of being my favourite if it wasn\'t that oily. It\'s ok with it being fatty, but it was still dripping w oil as well. The onions &amp; rockets that came w it were dripping oil too. The baby eel paper is exactly what the name says. Baby eel that\'s as thin as paper. Nice crunch but a little too thin that it didn\'t give enough bite.
Other than it tasting good. It certainly is unique to have a bottle sticking out of your glass. Also when the waiter brings this to your table, he would ask for a volunteer to drink as he pour so that it doesn\'t overflow. Which makes it interactive and fun as well. I sure love the mix of yucha with soju and hite beer! It\'s light and refreshing!
The very first bar that brew their own Makgeolli. \n<br />The Makgeolli Sampler. 😊\n<br />Different fruit blend with Makgeolli.
But still, every fried had the taste of the truffle oil! Just that it is less crispier, worth ordering though ☺️.\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Yucha Sojurita ($28)\n<br />Oh drink too fast, get high too soon.\n<br />The place is packed, luckily still got counter seat next to kitchen, when my gf keeps looking at the handsome guys in the kitchen.
I thought the Joo Bossam ($28) showcases the sweetness the flavour of the mangalitsa pork belly excellent. Take a piece of the boiled mangalitsa pork belly, white yucha kimchi and a bit of the spicy radish salad and eat it all together.
A makgeolli inspired bar/restaurant!!! Need I say more? BRING IT ON. From the addictive banchan at the start, to the delicious items on the menu, and of course, the drinks! I loved every single item on the menu 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
The thick cut mangalitsa pork belly is eaten together with spring onion salad and Dijon mustard. Have a bit of everything together to get a nice concoction of flavours in the mouth.
The red pepper paste cream sauce risotto comes with an Asian influenced flavour served with shrimp, black mussel, clam and squid.
Red pepper paste cream sauce giving that small hint of spiciness making all less gelat.
This is definitely the most potent cocktail of the night for me!I cannot resist that pretty shade of blue! 💙💙💙 #EileenFoodTasting #JooBarSG #JooBar
My tastebuds are tingling for this Yucha Sojurita. The name makes it sound like you should be doing some Latin dance whilst enjoying it. 😄 #JooBarSG
Mixture of soju, cointreau, lemon juice and of course yucha. Dipped with a bottle of hite beer. As you sip, the beer slowly fills the glass. Definitely a refreshing drink to go with.
Craving for this Yucha Sojurita ($28, for 2-4 pax) the moment I am back.
Like an ex-Eagle from BMT who was posted to Guards and just started gymming, this is half chewy lean torso and half slightly caramelized and burnt fatty bits. Essentially the perfect char siew and good on its own, but the add-ons on the side give it a tingly cold tanginess. 4.2/5
Essentially two drinks in one - it starts off all sweet feminine citrus and then once you go further down the rabbit hole it eventually segues into full-bodied, bubbly man fizz with a light citrus touch. [Thank you @joobarsg for the invite!]
Apparently these hexagonal copper lights were made by the owners themselves. Adds a very creative touch to the interior which includes this dark reflective wall on the second floor that we almost walked into, almost like walking into a different dimension. Wish I had spent more time checking out the interior on the other floors too. Something to explore in the future…
A refreshing &amp; zesty concoction of Joo Brew (Joo\'s House brew organic makgeolli), Grey Goose, Apricot Brandy, Cherry Blossom syrup, Lemon &amp; Rosemary.
Essentially deconstructed Korean army stew. You can merge the disparate elements into a mini stew within your mouth in manner of Power Ranger-esque Megazord transformation. The tofu wore its strong tofu taste with gusto, and I liked the tender, chewy pork belly bits hidden within the red mountain. 3.7/5
Slow roasted Mangalitsa Belly, a pork speciality at Joo Bar served with spring onion salad. This is no ordinary pork, it\'s a Hungarian Mangalitsa breed known for its depth of flavours, and touted as the Kobe beef of pork.
Got to be this Slow Roasted Hungarian Mangalitsa Pork Belly($32), grab a slice of this thick cut belly, good even by its own, even better with spring onion salad and the Dijon Mustard provided. So so good, I didn\'t hesitate for a second piece 🙊 A big thank you to #burpple for yet another enjoyable eatup and #joobarsg for having us 🙌 And yes, I\'m still alive and well today.
A delectable cross between ikan bilis and cuttlefish which is crispy snackeroos on its own, but squeeze lime over these babies and they soak up the citrusy tanginess with the absorbency of a Huggies diaper whilst still retaining its crisp. 3.8/5
Ikan bilis? Still can\'t believe they are baby eel though.... my unagis?
Served with yucha vinegar pickled cabbage and spicy radish salad. Pairs well with makgeolli &amp; soju.
Packed with chicken tenderloin, vegetables, Kimchi béchamel and puff pastry. I love the savoury taste of it and also the creamy soup. Talking about it makes me hungry again. Definitely something I would order when I\'m there again. Priced at [$14]
Anju - Food that goes well with alcohol .
A sea blue drink having a blend of Joo brew, tanqueray No. 10 Peachtree schnapps and Blue Curaçao gives a strong blueberry like alcoholic taste to it. Particularly nice but only for those who drinks a lot! 
Another dish which I enjoyed pretty much from yesterday. Being hand chopped, the minced beef loses it\'s usual toughness, melting away with each bite. Well soy marinated and topped with garlic flakes, chopped nuts and a sprinkle of spring onion.
This house made pork belly kimchi was.... good, tingingly spicy kimchi with added mangalitsa pork belly fats with tofu and spam in a well arranged manner.
With that squeeze of lime zest, these deep fried baby eel with chili salt are addictively good soaking in the lime taste well works well as an appetiser.
That taste blue..... beautifully crafted with their own joo brew, Tanqueray No.10, peach tree and blue curacao. Recommended for stronger drinker but not Raine... 😂
My favorite #tipple of the night. Yucha Sojurita, frozen soju-yucha-Cointreau-lemon juice mix with an overturned bottle of Hite beer. Good for sharing between 2-4 pax, this fizzy, citrusy alcoholic drink is refreshing &amp; easy to drink.
What better way to start off the @burpple #eatup tonight at @joobarsg than having cocktails featuring their own house brewed organic makgeolli (Joo Brew) .
Delicious creamy Seafood Gochujang (Hot Pepper Paste) Risotto with shrimp, black mussel, clam and squid. The Korean rice is prepared by gradually adding stock then finished off with cream and parmesan cheese.
Something to start off your weekend?
From left: original, yuzu, peach, strawberry, and lychee. I\'d return for the yuzu, which tastes like fancy Marigold Yuzu!
Risotto with shrimps, black mussels, clams and squids.
A fusion dish of western and korean. Seafood was remarkably fresh and although the taste was delectable, it might be a little weird for some to have this korean spicy taste in a cheesy risotto! 
My favorite dish of the night! Chicken with cheesy broth stored inside a puff pastry just makes it both unique and special. It has this unique taste to it that I cannot describe, one must try it to understand its taste!
Boiled pork belly with kimchi and spicy radish salad. Although the boiled pork belly was decent, having the roasted pork before this dish has made this dish relatively plain. 
Hungarian pork was flown in for quality assurance by the korean chef makes every bite of the fatty pork belly worth it! When ate with the special sauce and the vegetable assortments, the juices you taste with every bite is just so palatable!
Minced US prime rib steak. It has straightforward taste of a steak but much easier to munch on!
Not the usual steak that you can have, Joo offers this dish as their signature on their menu. This was flavorful but dislike the texture, would definitely prefer a fine cut beef steak instead!
The best dish of the night has got to be the Slow Roasted Mangalitsa Belly ($32). The thick cut pork belly paired with the spring onion salad and Dijon mustard is like a celebration of flavours in the mouth. 
House-made unique kimchi with mangalitsa pork belly, tofu, onion and scallion. This dish is one of my favorites with their kimchi and pork belly going so well together. It can get a little spicy so not recommended for people who cannot take spicy food. The tofu and spam when eaten together! gives two different textures in one bite!
Hand-chopped Korean Minced Rib Steak ($20) from Joo Bar. I just don\'t get why would anyone want to mince a fine-looking US prime rib because my kind of steak is a big cut of meat. The flavour might be good but the texture is not what I envisioned a steak to be. What a waste of a good piece of meat.
During last week\'s BurppleTastemakers Eatup, there are a few highs and lows. One of the highs has definitely got to be Warm Kimchi with Tofu &amp; Spam ($16). It\'s like a deconstructed Budae Jjijae with the pairing of the house-made kimchi, mangalitsa pork belly, tofu, onion and scallion together. 
Their unique house made tofu chips with avocado and kimchi flavored sauce. It gets more and more addictive as you dip those well fried chips into the special sauces given! An interesting dish to try in Joo bar! 
Deep fried baby eel with lime. Finger food for those who likes to munch along while drinking!
🍸Concoction 👉 Joo Brew, Grey Goose, Apricot Brandy, Cherry Blossom Syrup, Lemon &amp; Rosemary.
#JooBarSG is a great place for groups with drinks like the Yucha Sojurita that’s great to share. It’s a big glass of frozen soju-yucha-Cointreau-lemon juice mix with an overturned bottle of #Hite beer that refills the glass as everyone drinks up. And just a side note… Joo’s Yucha drinks are super refreshing and tasty!
There were pieces of pork belly in the kimchi!! So so good!!Thank you @eatwithroy for the invite and @joobarsg for having us yesterday! #EileenFoodTasting #JooBarSG #JooBar
😁 Still couldn\'t get away from the awesome tasting and gossip session with the guys last night! 😉 Presenting one of my favorite dish: the Kimchi Chicken PotPie at $14!
Deep fried baby eel, chilli salt &amp; lime zest. One of those addictive crispy snacks my fingers keep creeping back to for more. Comes with lime to squeeze on to these goodies, but I don\'t think it really made a difference to me as long as they stay crisp.
Probably the favourite of the night—Thick cuts of Hungarian mangalitsa pork belly that\'s been brined with salt, pepper, soju and makgeoli before being steam-roasted for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Seems like a very precise art which results in very tender and flavourful slices of pork that can be eaten with the accompanying spring onion salad and Dijon mustard. But the pork belly alone is a delight for the tastebuds.
😅 Seafood Gochujang Risotto. One of my favourite dish. Tasty rice with the red pepper cream sauce. 😋👍 Thank you @eatwithroy and @joobarsg for the invite.
Makgeolli Cocktails: Bulan Breeze. A very sweet and fragrance taste. Kind of too sweet for me though. [$20]
Busan Breeze &amp; Hong Dae Tripping.
House-made tofu chips to snack on while drinking my Busan Breeze.
Kimchi béchamel gravy with chicken tenderloin pieces and veges, hidden beneath a golden puff pastry dome.
Back at my favorite Makgeolli bar in town and this time round with the Burpple Tastemakers. This bucket of Baby Eel Paper is so addictive I can\'t stop at one.
Seafood Rapokki; all the good stuff in a bowl.. If only they spam more cheese in.. Then the dish will be perfecto!!! 👍🏻 Nonetheless, still finger licking good!! 😋😋
This dish is amongst the numerous delicious bestseller dishes we ordered from the Joo Bar menu some time ago for dinner. Definitely one of the most satisfying meals I\'ve had in awhile 😋
You deserve a good treat for yourself after a long work week! Joo is set to bring us creative alcoholic drinks complementing with top notch modern Korean bites in a sleek and casual dining setting, it\'s certainly on our list of Friday hipster chill-out places! Check it out for more on our blog!
It is born from a desire to offer top notch modern korean bites and drinks in a laid-back vibe. Love the ambience &amp; bites here especially the hand chopped korean minced rib steak 👍 More details on the link in bio.
Its colour was in a gorgeous dark hued orangey-red, taste well-balanced between the two. Who would imagine?
Why not some \'Anju\' (food that goes well with alcohol) to kickstart the evening - warm kimchi with tofu and spam to pair with their house brew organic makgeolli with selection of flavours such as black raspberry, yucha, mango and strawberry! For newbies, you can order the sampler to try all five creations for S$35 or different sized bottles of yucha as it\'s definitely my favourite!
on another note, the korean styled seafood risotto was rather pleasing to the buds. you know you get it right when you can taste the each grain of de risotto. \n<br />a really good weekend, meeting people - new, old and I\'m left ever so drained. cheers to another week of work. press in yall
Music is dope, the food is even better. The korean minced rib steak &amp; joo bossam is 😍 And makgeolli spam #joobarsg
Both anja are strangely addictive and good with makgeolli (roughly filtered rice wine).
Joo Wings, with spicy and sweet soy glaze over crispy batter.
Marinated with garlic, soy, honey and yucha, then finished with a smokey char-licked flavour. #JooBarSG
Exclusive to #JooBarSG are these sheets of baby eel imported from Korea – crispy and chewy at the same time, they\'re uber addictive with a sprinkling of salt and a spritz of lime juice. Definitely one of the best anju (bar snacks) to pair with your booze for a late-night snack!
Probably some of the healthiest chips you\'ll ever get, these quirky hexagons are made of mashed and compressed tofu. To complement the geometric crisps are two dips: homemade guacamole and kimchi salsa – I was hard-pressed to pick a favourite, but I think I\'m leaning more towards the well-seasoned avocado at the moment.
:\') 🎉🎊 and for that, it calls for celebration! 😁 Joo, a 2 months old makgeolli bar and restaurant may be a perfect hangout place!🍸 Beside their must-try home brewed makgeolli, we had lime and grapes soju mojitos. Personally prefer the grapes one which is more interesting and has a slight taste of sweetness. ☺️ Of course, we had some yummy sides along. Really addictive baby eel paper and tofu chips for you? Maybe because it says \'tofu\' so I guess I had a little too many of the chips. 🙊🙈
➊ JOO BOSSAM S$28 - the meat is boiled with doenjang (fermented bean paste) and served with yucha-vinegar-pickled cabbage and spicy radish salad. 
If there is an award for most Instagram worthy restaurant, Joo Bar would probably bag it away. Good mod food coupled with awesome drinks and good setting ambience, what else can go wrong? Service...superbly friendly...try it to believe it and I\'m not kidding. This is Lime Soju Mojito, one of the cocktails at Joo, it comes in a glass, small and large size. 
Checking out the hippest Makgeolli restaurant and bar in town. I think that Joo is specially tailored for foodies like us who enjoy taking pictures of their food.
One of the best types of food for a rainy night, and a Christmas Eve one at that, this chicken pot pie has chunks of meat and mixed vegetables in a rich bechamel tinged with kimchi. Break the roof of puff pastry into the pot to soak up the sauce. 
Simple pleasures in life, like layering a slice of firm tofu with a slice of salty spam, then topping it all with sheets of spicy pickled cabbage and lean pork – eat it all in one bite for a mini fireworks show of flavours in the mouth. And of course, wash the food down with Joo\'s homebrewed makgeolli infused with fruity flavours (pictured here are peach, strawberry and kiwi); the sampler includes 5 flavours in all, including the original Joo Brew. 
At last night\'s invited tasting, I discovered that many a happy hour can be spent Joo-fully over multiple cups of cold, slushy-like Yucha Makka and platters of Dak Kang Jung (chicken tenders coated in gojuchang, honey, garlic and chopped nuts) as well as Honey Butter Chick (more chicken tenders but marinated with a to-die-for honey butter glaze). I have to say, I much prefer the latter. The former was too similar to the sweet and sour pork you get at \"zichar\" stalls, albeit being a bit spicy.
🦑\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: Grilled well as the texture isn’t too rubbery but still provides the occasional snap as you bite it. The seasoning on the squid with a drizzle of lime is good enough on its own hence the Gochujang Mayo acts as a supporting character, truth be told most only remember the main cast. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />My only gripe is that the squid could be grilled a little longer for a crispier edge with a smoky finish but there’s a risk to pay which is sacrificing its perfect texture for a grilled squid. So you see, humans are naturally greedy sometimes you can’t get the best of both worlds so appreciate what is served to you. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />Most of the time it’s the company that makes the food taste so much better. To share a meal together is an invitation of being in one’s family. A memorable meal, special date and incorruptible companion.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #joobarsg #grilled #squid #grilledsquid #seafood #gochujang
🍦\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Ever since Matchapop discontinued there ain\'t really any Popsicle that can stand up to it. Tangy, Sweet, Milky &amp; a hint of Alcoholic kick. The Puff rice really adds a nice crunch, a near perfect ending to a Fusion meal. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />NehNehPop\'s Popsicle are priced steeper than the usual popsicles but some of the Flavours (which are interesting &amp; delicious btw) are on a limited run. So if any Flavour(s) caught your attention or eye, get it ASAFP - \"AS SOON AS FU*KING POSSIBLE\" 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #artichokesg #dudefood #joobarsg #annyeonghabibi #nehnehpopsg #icecream #popsicle #makgeolli #SugarCakePie
🍴\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: One can trust @artichoke_sg to handle gamy meats well, coming from the way they execute their Lamb Shakshouka (💵S$26) for Brunch &amp; Slow Roasted Lamb Shoulder (💵S$38) during Dinner. 🏵\n<br />.\n<br />Stewed till moist, the gamy lamb smell is quite faint &amp; the Fried chewy Tteokbokki has a nice contrast to the overall dish. Not a bad effort for considering that it\'s a fusion. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #artichokesg #dudefood #joobarsg #annyeonghabibi #lamb #tteokbokki #gochujang #meatshow #lambshoulder
🍗\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Succulent Juicy meat fried without being greasy, the Garlic Toum dip is what push the fried chicken into another dimension.

The naming of the \"humchi\" crackles me up but it\'s actually the most important component that binds everything together. If you are a fan of Korean food and Middle-Eastern, you would have probably guessed that the humchi is actually hummus and kimchi. The fried tofu chips act as a vessel to scoop up the humchi before transporting into your mouth for an explosion of flavours.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Joo Bar\n<br />Address: 5, Tan Quee Lan Street, Singapore 188094\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes
Any food items that\'s on a stick just magically makes everything better like kebabs, satays and of cause ice cream.\n<br />•\n<br />The recently concluded Annyeong Habibi popup event which saw the Korean wave from Joo Bar collaborating with the Middle Eastern inspired Artichoke to come up with a lineup of food that includes the Nehnehpop ($8). While we might see numerous variations of the Nehnehpop in the past, this limited edition one created by @fionatingx is stunningly made from a white chocolate sumac crust with makgeolli ice cream, yucha swirl and rice krispies.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Joo Bar\n<br />Address: 5, Tan Quee Lan Street, Singapore 188094\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes

Jus so you know, Chimaek is a compound word formed from Chicken &amp; Maekju, the Korean word for \"beer\". It refers to a combination of chicken (usually fried or spicy) as Anju &amp; beer served around evening in many South Korean restaurants. Anju is a general term for Korean food that\'s consumed with alcohol &amp; what is weekends without a pint @JooBarSg\'s Joo Beer in hand!\n<br />~\n<br />Pair those with FOUR different flavors of chickens including mainstays Honey Butter Chick &amp; Dak Kang Jun and Soy Garlic &amp; Nacho + Cheese; the latter two that\'s specially concocted for Chimaek Week!

And don\'t neglect the onion salad at the side too - the slightly sweet mustard sauce balances out the whole dish 👍
Served in a stone bowl, it can easily pass off as caveman food.\n<br />But upon mixing all the ingredients together, the mishmash gives the tatare a glittering pink radiance.\n<br />Creating a false impression that it is actually raw meat in disguise, the delectable blend of the savoury and garlicky flavours in the korean beef is further elevated by the fragrance of the sesame oil.\n<br />The pear and cucumber cubes adds a refreshing and fruity crunch to the tantalizing dish.\n<br />Finally, a raw gooey egg provides the coup de grâce.

On the side, the besties enjoyed the make-your-own bibimbap (available for lunch only), which included 1 carb, 1 protein and 3 complements starting from $10.90! I liked how to promote healthier eating, you are able to choose quinoa as a carb instead of white rice. The dish is served warm and fragrant on the hotplate.

Looks really tempting but fell short on expectation. Those who have tried what do you think? \n<br />#joobarsg #bugis #koreanfood
No idea where to head to for lunch? Here\'s one! This colourful sizzling stone bowl of bibimbap was so hearty it probably feeds two of me (but I\'m a small-eater la😂) . They\'re pretty generous with the ingredients. Best of all, you get to build your own - all from $10.90 onwards. Easy peasy - simply choose a carb (there\'s a healthier option of purple rice or quinoa), protein (loved the sweet, tender beef bulgoggi!), 3 complements and sauce (opt for the original for that savoury-sweet flavour with a mild spicy kick!). Every bibimbap comes topped with a beautifully runny egg. 
😝 Thanks for the tag @spadely for #eatbooksg! Keep tagging!
Picky when it comes to bibimbap ? Fret not! You can now design your own bibimbap from $10.90 onwards! So tasty that I\'m definitely going back again!🤗\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #beautifulcuisines #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #bibimbap

Wagyu beef &amp; yuzu makgeolli!  👍🏻👍🏻
At a price of $10.90++, you choose one out of three carbohydrates; one protein; three complements and a sauce. \n<br />So I chose purple rice which was just (according to the staff) black and white rice mixed together. The purplish hue was amazing and rice soft &amp; fluffy. I had the beef bulgogi...hmm ordinary. Garnished with shredded carrots, fried tofu and korean ikan bilis. Expectations ran high cos the onsen egg looked very promising as we expected to see the golden lava flow.
Loved the fact that they offered purple rice without additional charges and was quite impressed with their spicy chicken and runny egg! But their broiled saba was a tad too salty and had a bit of fishy smell :( #Burpple #sgfood #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #sgig #onthetable #burpplesg #joobar #bibimbap #tslmakan #stfoodtrending
Choose from white rice, purple rice or Quinoa and pick from Spicy Chicken, Stir-fried pork, Beef Bulgogi, Broiled Saba or Argentinian Grassfed Steak. You can even choose your complements eg. kimchi, baby lettuce and sauce. Add S$3 for a drink. #joobarsg #yummy #love #bibimbap #onmytable #koreanfood #delicious #exploresingapore #sgeats #sharefood #topcitybites #tslmakan #beautifulcuisines #nikonsg #burpple

The best pork belly I have ever tried😍
Went there for 2nd time. I was surprised that their customer service was very very bad this time1) walked in, there are many empty table but they told us \"fully booked\". 2) served drinks which we didn\'t order 3) paid by credit card, charged twice, they never apologies about this. I do not think I will go back to the place with that not pleasant service. 
Rating: 8 👍🏻
Even for someone not so keen on alcohol usually, I was in love with the yucha makgeolli, a yuzu flavoured ice blended Korean rice wine, it\'s like having a yuzu slushie! \n<br />A rather extensive menu of contemporary Korean fare. My votes goes to their Seafood Ceviche &amp; Tofu chips (made in house), Honey Butter Chicken and Roasted Mangalista Belly. \n<br />#joobar #joobarsg #korean #makgeolli #koreanbar #whati8today #burpple

Whilst the bitter and mega-crispy onion rings possessed an irresistible addictiveness and the lean mangalitsa belly - nicely covered in a sweet and mildly spicy sauce - was reliable as always, the poached egg had a curious vinegary wetness and the moisture-deprived rice appeared to possess mucho separation anxiety. 3.6/5
Let me make your decision easier as Joo Bar has just launched a line-up of dishes, exclusive to the lunch menu, which promises to whet your appetite and make you come back for more. No longer just limited to their dinner menu, you can now have mangalitsa pork all day, every day, as they have incorporated this luxurious piece of meat into their dishes.\n<br />.\n<br />One of them is the Baked Mangalitsa Kimchi Rice ($16) which is served in a cast iron dish that contains grilled mangalitsa belly, chopped house-made kimchi, béchamel sauce, an assortment of cheeses such as mozzarella, percorino and parmesan, and topped off with an egg and some crispy onion. The chopped kimchi in the rice provides an additional crunch while the torched cheeses creates the melted cheese pulling effect that makes everyone go \"wah\".\n<br />.\n<br />The lunch menu is available everyday, including weekends. This was a hosted meal by @joobarsg and many thanks to Cherry for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 5 Tan Quee Lan Street, Singapore 188094\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #foodphoto #makan #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood  #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #sginstagram #foodgasm #foodpic\n<br />============================

Need some army stew to warm me up. Bbbrrrr. #sgfoodies #sgfood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #burpple #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #foodvsco #armystew #joobarsg #barhoppingsg #sgbars #koreanfoodsg #sgfoodtrend #sggluttons #jamyundies #sgfoodiary #vscocam

My 5th time back at Joo\'s and it\'s starting to disappoint me. 2 milk carafes for 2 of us it\'s not enough. Just wanted a glass of ice water to wash it down so that i can order more but wanted to charge. #sgfoodies #sgfood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #hungrygowhere #burpple #jamyundies #foodpicsg #foodphotography #foodvsco #vscocam #eatoutsg #sgfoodunion #jamyundies #sggluttons #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodhoppers #sgfoodscene #igsg #sgig #sgigfoodies #sgbars #barsg #koreanbarsg #joobarsg
I don\'t mind eating this all day. 😋
Say \"Cheese\" with our \"Cheeks\" high high. And you can \"Poke\" my happy \"Belly\" after that. Have you figured what are the dishes yet? 😁✌️ #吃饱没事做 #JooBarSG #OngsLaiJiak #JiakBaTooFree #JooBar #PunIntended #KoreanFood #Korean
Love this place ! Good food and rice wine ;) 
Slow-roasted Mangalitsa Belly and Baby Eel Paper. 😍😘😋
Dk how to appreciate alcohol / makgeolli 😇 #joobar #korean #makgeolli #onthetable #sgfood #foodporn #igsg #yum #omnomnom #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple
Didn\'t enjoy this with da bffs. Tasted overly salty and fishy 😝 Perhaps over-fried in oil since it looked more chao-tah than usual? Interesting snack though! ✨ #joobar #korean #eel #onthetable #sgfood #foodporn #igsg #yum #omnomnom #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple
(😂 the song is stuck in my head HAHA). Slow Roasted Mangalitsa Pork Belly = hot favourite 😍 Perfect together with the spring onion salad and dijon mustard. PARTY FOR OUR TASTEBUDS. Birthday treat from my unbelievably awesome bffs @tingest @bahblahh from few weeks back ❤️ #joobar #korean #porkbelly #onthetable #sgfood #foodporn #igsg #yum #omnomnom #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple
Sojurita from @joobarsg
Topped with garlic flakes, chopped nuts and spring onions to give it another layer of texture and flavour, lifting the whole enjoyment.
This drink, aptly named the Sojurita ($28) is a soju based cocktail topped with an inverted bottle of beer (of your choice). The cocktail had a strong Yuzu flavour which made the drink refreshing and sweet, pairing really well with the salty and flavorful food choices. The Joo wings were also very good! I just found out they also serve lunch and dinner, and that the chef is korean! Will definitely be back to try the food. It\'s an affordable place to chill and drink, with a great atmosphere - music is not TOO loud, lights are not TOO dim. 
The thick cut pork belly paired with the spring onion salad and Dijon mustard is like a celebration of flavours in the mouth. \n<br />#FOODART #local #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #julsmakan #jiakholiao #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #foodie #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #vsco #vscocam #vscofood #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #joobarsg #eatup #korean
I just don\'t get why would anyone want to mince a fine-looking US prime rib because my kind of steak is a big cut of meat. The flavour might be good but the texture is not what I envisioned a steak to be. What a waste of a good piece of meat.
One of the highs has definitely got to be Warm Kimchi with Tofu &amp; Spam ($16). It\'s like a deconstructed Budae Jjijae with the pairing of the house-made kimchi, mangalitsa pork belly, tofu, onion and scallion together. \n<br />#FOODART #local #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #julsmakan #jiakholiao #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #foodie #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #vsco #vscocam #vscofood #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #joobarsg #eatup #korean
Great place to hang out and awesome food too! Weekday nights are best to avoid crowds! Check it out! #joobarsg #eatwithroy #foodie #foodsg #foodblog #foodgasm #foodpics #foodporn #foodreview #foodtasting #happyhour #sghappyhour #8dayseat #burpple
I finished every single grain here. 😍😍Have a creamy cheesy dream tonight! #JooBarSG #JooBar #EileenFoodTasting #korean
#bestoftheday deserves a post on it\'s own. | Yucha Makgeolli Slush. @joobarsg
Pretty ladies\' drink for you? My favourite #makgeolli #cocktail of the night!💓💗💕#JooBarSG #JooBar #EileenFoodTasting
Beautifully golden crispy. Very lite fishy taste. Virtually no fishy smell. Interesting but bland.
Boiled mangalistsa pork belly, white cabbage with preserved Yucha (korean yuzu) and of course kimchi.
Interlayered to make good Korean cocktail tidbits.
Fats = Flavour. Embrace it. Natural saturated fats is good for health! 😘🙆 #fatfatmeatseries #JooBarSG #JooBar #BringBackTheFats #EileenFoodTasting
I liked the whole industrial look and feel to the bar, plus the service was prompt and friendly. Their Joo Wings had me wanting more - that swert soy glaze was the clincher for me. Will definitely be back for more.
🙊🙊 But the one at @joobarsg made me break all the rules!Thinly-sliced potato chips fried in house. Sore-throat inducing snack, but who cares? 😁😍 #JooBarSG #JooBar #EileenFoodTasting
So addictive you can\'t stop at one...bucket!
Starting with the Makgeolli Sampler $35 for 5!

in my opinion. \n<br />that beef and kimchi pork was a real treat
my fav gotta be de yucha. 😋😋
Lovely korean fusion bistro bar hideout! Their house brewed makgeolli is definitely decent - non alcoholic fans can try their yuzu slush which is a tangy sweet &amp; sour combination. Enjoyed the tofu chips with guacamole / kimchi salsa dips &amp; the kimchi spam combination dish! Love the ambience, and i wonder if the table is deliberately made narrow for couples to lean towards each other 💑 The dishes here are very instagram worthy too! Mains are so-so ( i tried the kimchi chickenpie &amp; seafood risotto), perhaps I need to try the raved mangsalita pork belly before giving my verdict!
Thinking of the insanely addictive, crisp baby eel-paper at #JooBarSG.

Slow roasted mangalitsa belly - thick cut of mangalitsa pork belly served with onion, garlic and spring onion salad. \n<br />2. Joo Blossom - boiled manglitsa pork belly server with spicy radish and white yucha kimchi. \n<br />3. Warm Kimchi with tofu and spam - homemade kimchi tossed with manglitsa pork belly and served with tofu and spam. \n<br />It\'s not very common for restaurants in SG to serve mangalitsa pork, so these mains at @joobarsg are definitely a MUST-TRY. Of course, served best with some makgeolli. ☺️ full review on my dayre! :)
Even better washed down with homemade makgeolli infused with fruits. \n<br />#matchmadeinheaven #kimchi #spam #tofu #makgeolli #joobarsg #koreanfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodspotting #instafoodsg #burpple #eatoutsg
