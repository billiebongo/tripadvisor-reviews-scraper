The tartness of the calamansi &amp; lime zest custard and the bitterness of the chocolate tart shell of the Calamansi Chocolate Tart is a match made in heaven. This no-bake tart was super satisfying with those chocolatey notes but did not feel heavy on my stomach with the refreshing custard. Topped with torched meringue and dehydrated calamansi slices, I was glad it wasn\'t overly sweet and had the flavors well balanced out.
The whole experience was good and tasty although I have to say the portion is rather small for the price (i took the vegan Mc and cheese). The cheesecake did not taste like a real cheesecake but still it was good. The best desert was the apple crumble, so delicious.
Open Door Policy introduces its gluten and dairy free menu items and one of my favorite is the Spaghetti Alle Vongole. The pasta is freshly made using rice flour and it\'s absolutely springy! Each strand is well coated with the Japanese white miso sauce that is further enhanced with the sweetness from the clams.
Start your meal at Open Door Policy with the Vitel Tone ‚Äîsous vide veal loin sitting on a gluten free flat bread drizzled with tuna mayo and pickled purple cabbage. I liked the contrast between the crispy cracker and tender veal, seasoned with the tangy vegetables and creamy sauce.
Think perfectly cooked fish (tender, moist, and silky-smooth flesh with crisp skin), fragrant fried sakura shrimps, and a sweet and tangy Thai mango salad to pull it all together. If I had to nitpick, I\'d like the shredded mango to be less finely julienned for more texture and a little more of that characteristic bite, and for it all to pack more heat. But with their nice touch of earthy roasted cashews, I ain\'t complaining.
Open Door Policy has a new menu and it\'s gluten and dairy-free! How then, did they manage to create such a stunner of a dessert? ü§§
H O S T E D\n<br />Not sure which rock I was hiding under for the longest time but I only found out today Open Door Policy has a menu that is completely gluten-free and dairy-free. Head Chef Freddy has taken many, many months to experiment and fine-tune to make this possible while not compromising on flavours. Check out the above four dishes (clockwise from top left) which are new additions in the Mains section of their menu. \n<br />The Vegetable Tempura Risotto ($25++) is a clever contrast of crunchy-battered vegetables with the smooth yet chewy grains. I liked the subtle zing brought by the pickled pink ginger too.\n<br />If you prefer pasta, the Spaghetti Alle Vongole ($28++) which has a luscious creamy sauce made with white miso, should satisfy. I found the plentiful clams to be fresh and sweet as well.\n<br />The Roasted Pork Rack ($38++) was beautifully tender and juicy, with accompaniments of purple sweet potato and baby kailan that almost stole the limelight. I thought it\'s good that the spicy pineapple sauce was served on the side, so I could pour on the amount of hot and fruity sauce to my liking.\n<br />The Sou-Vide Salmon ($32++) was incredibly moist. And like the pork, had a sauce that\'s served in a jug. Having been simmered in a light, mild chilli and white miso soup, the daikon was one delicious chunk of yumminess. And I was a happy camper to see this comes with a profusion of green Chinese cabbage too.\n<br />After today\'s tasting, my conclusion is Open Door Policy is an ideal destination for those who are health-conscious, yet are unwilling to forego tastiness in their food.
H O S T E D\n<br />With extensive R&amp;D, it is possible to create desserts completely free of dairy and gluten that taste good too. That\'s what I found out when Jonathan and I were hosted by Open Door Policy for lunch today \n<br />The Calamansi Chocolate Tart, one of the desserts by Head Chef Freddy Ang that we got to try, features a base made with almond flour and pure cocoa powder that didn\'t need to be baked. The luscious filling packed a zesty punch from our local calamansi lime which gave this a unique tropical slant. Neatly balancing off the sourness was a blanket of puffy meringue.
First time here. Pricier than normal brunch but the quality is also one notch higher. Worth it with the Entertainer app. Portions are not big, but are good enough for me. Loved their little vertical wall garden of herbs.
This pan seared crispy quail was one of the more meaty-sounding items on their menu. It was served with turnips and chickpeas casserole and banana shallot. The small quail with lots of vegetables shouted healthy food with its relatively light flavours. \n<br />The other King crab orecchiette dish that we ordered also tasted \"healthy\" with its saffron and corn sauce. To sum it up, this place would definitely appeal to those who will go lighter on taste for a healthier meal. For us, we wanted something bolder.
Can\'t say no to healthy stuff that tastes good, though we wished their portions would just be a tad larger because we polished off those tiny pieces of meat way too quickly. #burpple #brunch
The veal was tender but what I really loved was the carrot risotto.
How do you eat these beauties without your heart breaking? The Light Almond Milk Custard had a mild subtle taste. Very much like tau huey, but you know, more atas. The other one (I forgot the name) was a little weird. The sago was a strange match with the very delicious black sesame ice cream. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting.
Major thumbs-up üëç to Chef Ryan Clift and his team at @OpenDoorPolicySG for the experience, and also providing a delicious option for diners with dietary restrictions.

Filled with fermented root vegetables, garlic soil and garden herbs for a light start to your meal.\n<br />Unlike some gluten-free and dairy-free foods which can be a little bland, both taste and texture wise, Open Door Policy\'s creative take on these dishes shows that gluten-free food can look and taste great!\n<br />#OpenDoorPolicySG
Mountain yam rosti, old fashioned Bismarck wagyu rump, runny egg yolk, chunky tomato dressing, stir fried water spinach.\n<br />.\n<br />One of the items from ODP\'s new #GFDF brunch menu, which did nothing to help me decide if I enjoy their new culinary direction. Kudos to cooking the beef perfectly üëåüèª though pairing a sweet tomato chutney-like sauce was quite abrupt and odd. The rosti too, though commendably crisp, was julienned way too thin and tasted like a savoury, crunchier cousin of our childhood cuttlefish snack ‚Äî not shiok at all.
It\'s everything I\'d enjoy constructed into a dish. \n<br />Defo coming back fer thissss!
Umami flavour bombs all around with a good hint of spice, loads of textures, fit for sharing though I\'d be happy to pick off every morsel meself. \n<br />If you\'re heading to @opendoorpolicy with a bunch of 4-6 friends, opt for the \'FEED US\' option. It\'d satisfy both your greedy belly and your pockets. \n<br />21bucks/serve of charred chorizo\n<br />51bucks/pax for \'Feed Us\'
Wakame and romaine lettuce with hamachi sashimi, with miso dressing. Definitely preps your tastebuds for the mains. 
Probably the lesser ordered dessert compared to their popular 8 spiced apple crumble and souffle. I love their souffle but decided to give this a try. Didnt regret it, mousse with light and the taste of the hazelnut and chocolate was perfectly balanced. A dessert to order again!
Their pistachio n choc souffle was full marks. As they have just changed their menu, it was replaced by mango and chocolate souffle. M not a fan of mango but decided to try it and it was not disappointing. Texture of souffle was fluffy and the taste of mango n chocolate complemented each other very well!
I ‚ù§Ô∏è fish so when i saw cod on the menu, i went ahead to order w/o checking the sides/sauce. So i was surprised that it was served with this masala veloute which tasted like curry! Interesting combination but cod didnt have the creamy taste (prob ttz y they paired with a stronger tasting sauce). Think i still prefer their barramundi with dashi. 
Went there for their pancakes, and didn\'t think I\'d found another stellar dish. As of today: BEST FRENCH TOAST. EVER. Insanely moist brioche, boasting a superb char along the edges (no seriously, it was crisp and all caramlise-y), and melt-in-your-mouth insides. It soaked up all the juices from the roasted berries, lending to a fireworks of flavours and textures. Haven\'t finished my sweet brunch dishes in awhile, but this I mopped all up in no time.
I felt really eager to try this the moment the service staff cuts the souffle and pours the creme into it. The 15mins wait was worth it. Light and fluffy, it wasnt a heavy dessert and the surprise was it tasted like my fav pandan cake!
This, I must admit, was a gamble. Simply because the mushy-on-mushy combination sounded too risky on paper, but it actually worked. The citrusy guacamole zing teamed well with sour cream to balance out all that creamy richness, but it could shortly turn monotonous. #opendoorpolicy #burpple
Mad about this pancakes right now! By far one of the best I\'ve had. Cause one, the portion\'s small and peeeerfect for one; and two, the flavours and textures are just lovely. I don\'t know how they did it, but the pancakes were different from most yet absolutely delish. It\'s like...McDonald\'s hotcakes but artisanal, atas and better (most of us like that processed pancakes so don\'t pretend). Topped with the most addictive poached strawberries, creme patisserie and ice cream, every bite was just mmmmm.
Aside from how uncomfortable it looks, this sago custard cake wasn\'t all that bad. The moist, chewy custard cake was a surprisingly good complement to the jelly-like sago seeds. If you don\'t like sago though this is wouldn\'t be your thing. But if you do it\'s featured in the Lazy Susan menu that\'s running at Open Door Policy till 24th Jan, so make your way down soon before it ends!
Not sure everyone\'s willing to pay S$32++ for a simple full works, but at least to me ODP\'s English Breakfast is worth the odd splurge. Nothing special, but every component\'s done exceedingly well: good sourdough, perfect sausages (see the grill marks?!), amazing homemade beans, and super fresh on-the-vine tomatoes. Only the scramble was a bit off (overheated and grainy), but then again by default the eggs are just half cooked.
Not your typical brunch fare, but this Kangaroo Fillet (S$20++) is one of the best meat dishes I\'ve had all week. It doesn\'t taste nearly as exotic as it sounds. The meat\'s fairly neutral, quite chewy yet tender and juicy. Served with roasted brussel sprouts, pine nuts, pickled baby onions, and vinegar juice, the resulting flavours are absolutely stunning. Love the tangy yet buttery sauce that brings everything together! Portion\'s smaller and price\'s reduced this January in order to manage the concurrent menu of Lazy Susan\'s - perfect time to try it if you\'re afraid of being over-adventurous.
Perfectly seared wagyu rump with a kickass b√©arnaise sauce to heighten the deliciousness factor. Laid on a brioche toast and topped with two irresistible poached egg. How not to love? 
Though it was not bad in terms of taste, I found the portion too small and overpriced.
Highly recommend! Made fresh with creme anglaise poured into the souffl√© at the table. Be prepared to fork out $18 for this though. 
Pricey ($32) but melts in your mouth and well worth the money. Truffle mash and mushrooms were excellent as well. 
I was craving for some good rosti as soon as I woke up. The rosti at ODP was a slight disappointment for its dry and burnt rosti. I prefer those that are slight burnt with crispiness but ODP didn\'t satisfy me. Surprisingly, besides sliced pork sausages, I was getting full from the overwhelming portion of scrambled egg.
Essentially sensually gooey and remarkably intense apple meets happily grainy sugar crumble. 4/5
The soft, chewy beef cheek here has the manly essence of a rugged and hard-working farm labourer, whilst elsewhere the truffle mash is as reliable as the Japanese train system and the roasted mushrooms delightfully juicy. 3.7/5
paglia e fieno taglierini with hand chopped lamb ragout &amp; shaved pecorino cheese ($26).. ermm also the most refined \"ÁÇ∏ÈÖ±Èù¢‚Äù you can ever find.
because i heard theres a new protein in town - kangaroo. nicely executed culinary efforts to mask the \"gameier\" fillet (imho) with good smokiness, vinegar jus and sweet roasted baby onions. joey came with a comfortable smooth chewy texture in between bites. totally love the addition of pine nuts which lends a nutty flavor and much needed crunch to the dish!
Somebody should feed this joey some liang teh (cooling tea) because it must be very heaty given how deeply smoky its flavour is. Each mouthful starts off on a slightly salty note, and the juices involved are gamey enough to remind you that this ain‚Äôt no domestic pet. 3.8/5
Despite being a Passion Fruit &amp; Chocolate Tart, I personally felt that this dish is more on the chocolate side of things from the chocolate tart base to the chocolate mousse which are bittersweet; the only Passionfruit flavour comes from the cheese-like piece on the top which seems a tad subtle with downplayed flavours so as to not overwhelm the whole tart. Interestingly, the bottom comes with popping candy that makes it fun to have, but I would definitely choose the Apple Crumble or the Chocolate Pistachio Souffl√© any day over this.
People come here specially for the souffl√©,  but if you do have space and can afford for just one more dessert, I suggest you order this. Never had I seen one Apple Crumble coming in a mortar bowl, and definitely never had one with crumbles as a crunchy and light yet carrying such heavy hints of spices with so many huge chunks of sweet, caramalised apple that is chunky yet soft. Definitely out of this world!
I particularly like Creme Br√ªl√©e, and this one is indeed unique for how it is completely made out of brown sugar from the Creme br√ªl√©e within and all the way to how it is infused into the ice-cream. The Creme Br√ªl√©e felt less sweet than the usual, yet comes with a crackling torched sugar top which makes it so exciting to dig in. Ice-Cream was also subtle in flavour as well, which quite fits in the overall feel of this dish somehow.
The whole table was simply waiting for this to arrive, for this is apparently what Open Door Policy is known for so I had to pretend that I was excited for it even though I had no idea what was going on (just kidding!). Presented in a cup, the waiter/waitress cuts a cross in it before pouring the Creme Anglaise in. First spoon in and you get that vanilla and custard-like flavour with a chocolate cake-ish taste alongside a fluffy, creamy and molten pistachio centre, and eventually lead into a thin pool of chocolate sauce below. It\'s so heavenly that one can never be enough, and I am certainly not going to share this if I were to patronize by my own next time. Oh yes; I now would also believe why a riot would form outside the restaurant if they ever remove this item from the menu; it\'s just so good and it\'s not only just a must-try, but a reason to return for!
All the pasta here is made in-house, and this comes colourful noodles; one of the usual form and the other, green. Tossed in a hand-chopped Lamb Ragout, the flavours for this dish was rather intense with the gamey flavours of lamb going with a strong cheesiness that runs throughout. Pecorini Cheese is also shaved atop for additional flavour.
Ravioli comes wrapped with Watercress, Macademia and Feta Cheese, accompanied with pearl onion and romaine lettuce. The pasta wasn\'t too thick, and despite the use of feta cheese this was not too cheesy. Instead, the nuttiness of Macademia made this a dish that was interesting both in flavour and texture.
First time tasting Kangaroo and I must say that I am glad to have tried it because I don\'t detest it at all! Done with a pinkish-centre, the dynamics of the meat felt very similar to beef with a slightly fatty centre, but the overall graininess of the meat felt rather similar to pork with a little more smoothness. Honestly it\'s pretty much a class of its own, and really hard to explain in words. If you could get over the fact about eating a Kangaroo, perhaps this is worth trying just for the experience!
Perhaps the most interesting execution of Kale; this \"soup\" would appeal to Kale lovers for its very intense flavours of its signature bitterness that runs through the broth. The egg helps to cut down the strong flavours, but it was the dried Kale chips which I found most interesting; crispy in the way similar to seaweed. This is one dish that you might not love at first taste, but it does reel you in after a few spoons.
Coming full of seafood, there is quite a variety that accompanies the risotto here such as mussels, prawns and scallops so it\'s almost like getting the entire package. Risotto was gooey, creamy and cheesy with a little tomato tang, while the scallop was pretty soft even after being pan-seared.
Perhaps one of my favourite mains at Open Door Policy was this; it\'s definitely not hard to fall in love with such tender beef that literally melts in the mouth without having to chew and that truffle mash carried that earthy aroma consistently throughout so evidently. Can never get enough of this!
My favourite side of all has to be this; Wakame &amp; Romaine Salad which comes with Hamachi slices, tomatoes and onion and miso dressing. Hamachi sashimi was sliced thickly and in generous portions; each slice tasting only of freshness and chewy yet melty at the same time. As the garden salad below is dressed with an onion and miso dressing, the sauce induced a Japanese-flavoured savouriness that matched the sashimi so well, as well as a tasteful slimy and chewy texture with the smart use of seaweed in the dish!
Yet another interesting dish served here, this was rather Mexican for some, but was a tad Moroccan for me. The guacamole risotto itself was smooth, but it carried a gamey lamb sausage-like flavour which was rather pleasant but a tad heavy at the same time. Coming full with nacho chips, spread some of the risotto atop the enjoy. Also comes with a perfectly poached egg yolk which flows with a poke of the fork. 
A rather Indian-inspired dish, the lamb spring rolls despite gamey, were easy to the palette for the vegetables within and the crisp skin were able to even out the flavours just nicely. Coming with fresh salsa, the tanginess helps to kill any overpowering flavours of lamb, while the yogurt and avocado helps to neutralize the dish in terms of flavour.
According to the chef, the octopus was confit before being sliced, which is why the octopus was soft and bouncy but not being rubbery at the same time. It carried a citric flavour which gave it a refreshing taste of tanginess from the romesco, and came with garlic and parsley potatoes at the side
We were told that Crab Cakes isn\'t a dish that the chef here likes, but he instead of it being an obstacle, he had worked around it and created a version that he would like. Fried till golden-brown and crisp on the exterior, the interior comes with shredded crab meat that somehow was still able to carry the freshness of the crustacean. Underneath was a pea salad which was spiked in mint oil; something different from the usual that I would detest that was rather refreshing.
medium-rare wagyu cut served w potatoes, red onions and poached eggs aka favourite eggs ha! gotta rave about their chilli bearnaise sauce cos it\'s just so damn yummilicious! üòã YAY FOR BRUNCH! #burpple
Interesting preparation of octopus. Very light, like a salad. My friend had the braised beef cheek with black truffle mash and roasted mushrooms. Super tender and utterly tasty. 
ODP is one of those extremely rare places which I can recommend without reservations. Rich and creamy -- breakfast food for posh grown-ups. 
For a good starter, Lobster Velout√© [$20] will never go wrong. It was so rich in flavor, and saffron rouille gave the overall experience a little creamy. Croutons makes a happy ending alittle crunchier!

Served: Wagyu (medium well), Ratte Potatoes, Poached Eggs, Red Onions, Chili Bearnaise &amp; Brioche Bun.
The standard dropped a little, I thought. While served with generous chunks of apple and cinnamon, there was less crumble on the top, making it less moist. Still a crowd-pleaser, i guess...
A new addition to the revamped ODP menu, this is a must-try dish and deserves all its hype. The souffle is all marshmallow goodness, not too rich, not too sweet. 
Although not a chef recommendation on the menu, certainly one of the best rosti dishes that we\'ve ever had.
Smooth black truffle mash and roasted mushroom is perfect with the beef. It melts in your mouth. 
The brunch menu is only available on weekends and public holidays from 11am - 3:30pm.
Our favorite hipster brunch spot Open Door Policy has launched a spanking new brunch menu coupled by a new brunch cocktail menu of 14 intoxicating tipples by Head Bartender of Tippling Club, Kamil Foltan. It\'s so boozy it\'s outrageous.
Brunch with a slight twist
One of the fluffiest pancakes I\'ve ever had in Singapore, this buttermilk pancake is served with an uber smooth creme patisserie and poached strawberries, topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream that binds all the flavors together.
What makes a more beautiful brunch than having truffled eggs, portobello mushrooms, spinach and toast all in one? 
The sun just got to go somewhere when I took the photo lol. Sun why you so shy! ‚òÄÔ∏è
Was contemplating between the apple crumble and chocolate souffl√©, but since I\'m not a fan of pistachio, decided to skip the latter. The apple crumble may not seem much, but the first mouth got me wow. The crispy crust and crunchy streusel, combined with the soft tangy but not too sour apple was simply addictive. A note, you may want to pour in the vanilla sauce a little by little so that it doesn\'t get soggy while you savor the dish! Hmm. 
Have tried brunch at ODP previously, so was excited to be back to try their dinner! Read a lot of reviews about their burger, so naturally, it was my first choice of order. The burger patty was as reviewed, juicy, succulent and grilled just right to keep the beef taste. The rest of the burger, however, didn\'t do much justice to it, as the bun and fries were pretty much ordinary. Otherwise, a pretty decent burger, I would say.
For starters, we decided to go for the lobster cream soup which was lovely. The soup was fragrant and intense in flavor. Paired with crystal bread and goat\'s cheese, it may be a little on the heavier side, but just perfect for sharing. Wished it would have some lobster bits as well! 
It was Strawberry\'s party and this little tart did not hold back, going full-on loco with gloriously intense flavours. To avoid being upstaged, she surrounded herself with inconsequential guests who would, in contrast, highlight her lusciousness. She even invited magician raspberries to perform at the start of the party for that extra smoky oomph. 4/5
It\'s comparable to the great feeling of luncheon meat fries
The souffl√© is of such an angelic texture - so velvety soft it\'s almost liquid - a new word should be coined to describe the in-between state of matter to which the souffl√© belongs. C\'est magnifique. As for the picture, I went for Moscow abandoned-bathhouse chic. 4.25/5
When a dish turns out as interesting as it sounds in the menu, I am a happy camper. What a lovely harmony of textures and flavours is to be found in this. The important thing is to have a bit of everything together in each bite; the crunchy rosti, the soft and sweet roasted tomato, the amazing Wagyu beef \"bresaola\", garlicky spinach and oozy egg. The one element that I thought was rather out of place was the white anchovies; I found it a little too sharp, too sour to sync smoothly with the other components on the plate.
I liked the look of this - such a refined presentation of the classic English fry-up. So stylish it was and the quality of the ingredients was as expected, very good. However, I can\'t say I was exactly blown away by the flavours. With the recent proliferation of caf√©s, I\'m starting to realise \"big breakfasts\" everywhere don\'t differ by much. The flip side of that is you know what you\'re going to get every time. 
Although they get their beans from Forty Hands, theirs is a dark roast as opposed to the fruity roast served at Forty Hands cafe itself. Composed of beans from Ethiopia, India and Bali, I found it especially enjoyable as a cappucino. 
Modern Bistro furnished with rustic interiors. Refreshed brunch menu for the weekends. What\'s interesting? It\'s all about their mismatched steel chairs, teak-wood planked floors &amp; glass in show kitchen! 
Serves with bacon, egg, roast tomato, fried mushroom + additional of fries! This is not the usual burger that you have at any restaurants. ODP serves their food generously at the price you pay, you get more! The beef petite weigh 250gm, can you imagine that thickness of the burger? 
&amp; Rocket with tarragon on toasted brioche. It\'s purely well done for the combination of scrambled eggs and poached asparagus. Strictly for egg lovers only!
Poached eggs with saut√©ed spinach, sourdough and curried hollandaise sauce. This is somewhat interesting and strictly for curry lovers. Alittle spice and sweetness from the combination of sauce and egg yolk. This should be one of the reasons why you\'re here!
An experienced barista surely knows his coffee well. Unfortunately, this barista don\'t. It was pleasant at the start hearing some wise words from the staff that ODP is using 22 Martin as one of their primary blend from CMCR. But the reputation went all down to the drain after my first sip. And yes, the barista didn\'t pulled it well and it turn out having a mixture of bitter-sour after taste. Other than coffee, everything was absolutely perfect!
Big portion - More than enough for two people! Big chucks of buttery crumble gave a mouth fulfilling texture. Serving on the hot stone was a genius idea. Keeping the apple at the warm temperature and preventing it from being cold and stale.

The egg Benedict is average, it\'s a good place to talk with your pals tho. Overall: 2.8/5 
Easy to see why this is their speciality! Unfortunately I\'m not a fan of pork belly, however I kept pinching off the meaty parts. Definitely a must try! 
Pretty decent bouillabaisse despite the negative reviews, the seafood stock was pronounced and flavorsome although the prawns was a tad over cooked 
Heard both good and bad reviews about this place so wasn\'t sure if I should try it but the dishes turned out to be delicious. @alainlicious
It\'s been a while, since I last catch up with her. Awesome eat out and lovely company. 
Big love for the interior design! Really love the atmosphere, service was good. 
I would say food here is pretty good. I had the rosti, and the roasted tomato is love üòç. Plus the piccolo latte has my approval üòöüëç
Fluffiest souffl√© I\'ve ever had. Freshly baked, the waiter presents and cuts it four ways allowing the steamy subtle scent of mango to fill the air. Caramel and bitter chocolate complement the delicate souffl√©. 
Flavorful well seasoned chunks of quail go well with crunchy bits of pancetta, together with the distinct meat enhancing flavor of spinach and a light creamy lemon butter sauce. The dish is a symphony of assorted flavors and textures.
In this gorgeous setting, order the equally gorgeous plate of French toast for brunch. The hot brioche is cut into 4 chunks and is perfectly caramelized and dusted with icing sugar. Roasted berries form a compote and are both sweet and sour, complementing the creamy vanilla ice cream. If you\'re heading to Tiong Bahru and craving French Toast, don\'t hesitate to get these. Photo by Christine Tjong.
Apple crumble with vanilla cream. Toasty baked bread crust and not overly sweet filling like many other apple crumbles. Stone pot just for aesthetics, not actually heated.
With soy and yuzu dressing, this tuna tartare is a huge contrast as compared to their steak tartare which I had before. Very light and crisp with a distinctive Asian influence. Instead of chips or bread, this dish was served with prawn crackers.
I want those truffles in my mouth mama :D
Returned to ODP for dinner and got the \"surprise us\" 3-course menu. Food wasn\'t as delish as the first time we were there. Some dishes were unevenly seasoned and tasted kinda one-dimensional. Braised beef cheek is still good though. And of course, still a beautiful place for a first-date *wink*. 3 nombles.
The flavour combination of this dish is just as intense as it looks. 
Birthday brunch with @pixietigre. Local braised beef cheek meets French toast with berries. #rachelis23not18
This is the only kind of cheese that can be pan fried according to my friend. Chewy and light in taste. Fried together with bread and olives, the mix gives a pan of different textures. To top it, the chef puts anchovies which tastes drastically different from the other ingredients. This dish is simple but offers a positive complex experiences for the tastebuds.
During my birthday, I went to this restaurant twice for lunch and dinner. The manager, a friend, got me this wonderful souffl√© with a little bit of their forest cake. It\'s simply beautiful. The vanilla cream that is added after dissecting the top of the souffl√© makes it less dry as compared to others. One of my favorite dessert, and you know, I\'m no dessert fan.
Stunningly attractive. I never take strawberries, but this sorbet is light and perfect after a heavy lunch. I couldn\'t bear to destroy it with my dessert spoon. It just looks too stunning!
Stunning isn\'t it? Served with two Chinese buns just like the popular local Chilli crab which was the idea behind this pasta. However, the sauce was too light and couldn\'t blend together with the linguine, resulting in a very uncertain taste. I guess with such a name, it\'s harder to live up to its expectation and standard.
This pan seared sea bass is served with fried potato fries and a bed of rocket salad. I must say this really plays with your taste palate. The fries are sweet and oily, and the rocket salad is mildly bitter, dry and crunchy. And the sea bass is smooth and tasty. An interesting welter, well intended.
Roar!
I seldom enjoy my desserts. But this one served with vanilla custard is a Must Try. Served in a stone bowl, the crumble is on top instead of the usual bedding. The apple mix is appetizing and compliments the crunchy crumble top. They marry each other perfectly and sets your tastebuds on a spoon-after-spoon streak. There\'s no stopping on this one.
Beautifully displayed with a drizzle of mushrooms and other greens resembling the forest floor. Tasted really rich and thick. I love anything with mushroom but this came off as a little superficial to me. I couldn\'t get to the taste of it, just keeps escaping me.
My favorite soup of all time. A unique blend drizzled with truffle oil, this soup is light yet rich in flavor.
Crusted duck fillet served with mint yoghurt dip. This starter is delicious and creative. Looks and tastes pretty good.
Roasted Field Mushrooms on Toasted Brioche and Truffle Pur√©e - this was yum! The mushrooms and pur√©e gave the dish a very umami taste, and I would recommend this for brunch. I personally prefer a more rustic and bright place for brunch, though you might want to visit this place for a modern NYC bistro feel. Verdict: 6.8/10
Brunch at this stylish restaurant hidden in Tiong Bahru along Yong Siak Street. I had their Smoked Salmon with Scrambled Eggs on Toasted Ciabatta. Nothing special about the dish apart from really yummy spinach. A little disappointed!
Mountain yam rosti.

Souffle (16)-maybe it did not rise as much as i expect, and acai isnt really my preference, but is one incredible souffle 4.5/5
Ordered this as part of a lunch set ($25++). Rice wasn\'t cooked and overall, the flavor was just not there. Didn\'t taste like paella.
Out of all desserts, souffl√© is probably one of my Favourite. However, One will be mentally fighting to familiarise with the prominent Flavours. ü•Ñ\n<br />.\n<br />The taste of the souffl√© was a surprise (it\'s interesting as a Friend once said) as well, all along the table there was an unspoken agreement of the sharp acidity coming from the Acai Berry Cr√®me Anglaise together with the Chocolate souffl√©. I\'d eat the souffl√© by itself rather than pouring the Acai in. üññüèª\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #opendoorpolicysg #sugarcakepie #souffl√© #chocolate
The tangy salad is tossed with cashew nuts &amp; Sakura shrimp imported from Japan.

üçÆ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: Out of all the nuts, cashew Milk has the most distinct milky taste which is the sole reason &amp; good substitute for Dairy milk, thus it\'s used to churn out this Custard speckled with silky vanilla bean. ü•Ñ\n<br />.\n<br />With golden Kiwi compote that\'s reduced with lime &amp; mint for that extra dimension of citrus which is crucial for that delicate bitter-sweet chocolate tuille.

Served with charcoal GF fried bread. ü•ë\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTKüíÆ: One will quickly notice the trend of Fried Bread served in their starters. As Gluten acts as a \'glue\' binding agent if you will, hence ODP use frying as an alternative to bind it (At least I think that\'s the reason, for crying out loud I\'m not a Chef) Although fried, it is not oily &amp;/or greasy. üèµ\n<br />.\n<br />The Drinks Menu are of course, GFDF too.

Chocolate tart base had a crisp texture. Curd scintillating tangy. Meringue... omg... light, a tad sweet and citrussy.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ It came on greyish plate but me being itchy fingers, I transferred on my side plate. Well... cos many have been posting the same plate on ig. I am just \"thinking out of the plate\".\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />@opendoorpolicysg has a cool rustic comfy surrounding. However, we felt that it would be more comfortable if we were served with \"smiles\". At least, despite the discomfort, we enjoyed our dessert. Hmm.... should we go back for mains in the near future?? Probably.

Everything they serve here is gluten free and dairy free, but that doesn\'t compromise the taste at all. .\n<br />.\n<br />The spaghetti is a bit pale in color because they use gluten-free spaghetti made from rice flour and xanthan gum. Tossed in a creamy Japanese white miso sauce with sweet white clams, it was a satisfying and well-balanced dish. . .\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @blessincasia and @opendoorpolicysg for hosting us.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #foodcoma #foodphotography #foodgasm #sgfoodie #cafesg #food #yummy #sgfoodblogger #foodstyling #foodstylist #foodplating #flatlay #burpple #likesforlikes #foodblogger #f52grams #noodle #healthy #openrice #hungrygowhere #foodie #italianfood #spaghetti #glutenfree #sgfood

When it made its final approach to our table, the fragrance of the dish was pure intoxication. The nicely judged and cooked apples have just the right amount of sugar to temper the acidity. And an unmistakable tinge of nutmeg to give it a slight bitter and nutty undertone to ground the dessert from a sugar high. Exceptionally good plate of pudding. Oh yeah, the vanilla tinged creme anglaise is gorgeously luxurious and comforting all at once. In fact, all around comfort plate of dessert! :)\n<br />#applecrumble #nutmeg #cremeanglaise #vanilla #sgfood #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #opendoorpolicysg #comfortfood
