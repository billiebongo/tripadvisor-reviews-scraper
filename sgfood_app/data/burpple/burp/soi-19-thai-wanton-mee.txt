The only reason to convince me to kick start a Sunday morning to queue like a true Singaporean would be just this. A bowl full of flavourful noodles,  lup cheong , wantons and fried pork lard. Need I say more ?
I know I know, everyone orders the dry version haha! My friend who brought me here insisted I try the soup one. Was there about 2pm but the queue was still there. The wait wasn\'t that long and food was served quite quickly! The large version ($5) for both dry and soup has more ingredients thrown in, like slices of lap cheong. Added in fish sauce, chili flakes and fried pork lard too. Woah the pork lard! I usually don\'t eat them because it\'s too oily for my liking and I\'m not a fan of the aftertaste but it was surprisingly good with the soup - flavorful and retaining some crunch. Soup has a slight aftertaste I can\'t make out of but still addictive. Would be back to try the dry one! 
...! üòç Haha, I\'m stopping myself from eating too much if not my KpopxFitness session will be in vain. üòÇ Sharing is caring!
I am so glad to have a neighbour that have random food cravings like me. Even better when it\'s late into the night, and we are like ghosts out during the 7th month. Located in AMK, the store is comparable if not better than the original in BKK. Everything in this dish of happiness screams oily, but it\'s just so good that you can\'t stop. For a regular bowl, they sure ain\'t stingy, and the portion put shame to so many wanton store in Singapore. I couldn\'t finish the noodles, even though I very much want to. And because this place is so near to us, it has always been our usual breakfast-to-go, before we split to head for work, smiling like a boss! Onward and forward to more neighbouring food adventures :) 
Famous for their Thai wanton mee, this stall is also offering pork knuckles rice (Thai style) at $5.70 (for taking away) as well. The pork knuckle that was served over white rice was well marinated, tender and delicious. Came here around 11am + and there\'s no queue (Yay!). Btw, 1 whole pork knuckle is selling at $8 (without rice) if you guys are interested.
From al dente noodles to the heavenly lardy goodness, the bowl was extremely satisfying without any sauce together with the big, meaty wantons in broth. Someone on the table actually commented that the broth had standards like Crystal Jade or Ding Tai Fung. Well worth the queuing time of almost 25 minutes. \n<br />#burpple #hawkerpedia #soi19thaiwantonmee
I guess the craze over Thai wanton noodles travelled from +66 to +65! Even on this extremely hot day, this bowl of wanton noodles swims well in my belly! This unlimited portions of crispy pork lard clinging on to springy egg noodles served with sliced fatty char siew &amp; fried wanton. Probably the closest you can get to the street wanton stores that you see lining up along the roads of BKK. #BurppleAMKHawkers
We had the #soi19wantonmee today at Ang Mo Kio. They have the normal and the black sauce version. Personally I prefer the normal one over the black sauce one. Bcos you can taste the difference of the #thaiwantonmee for the normal \"white\" one vs the \"black\" sauce one which is similar to our local style. Go try it and hashtag #foodreviewssg &amp; #foodreviewsasia to share with us!
Noodles are al-Dente, seasoning for the noodle was spot on. 
It\'s time for breakfast :)
Came here about 6 months ago to try. Today I can confirmed it is not worth the queue time. Noodles is dry even when applied fish sauce. Ingredients are crappy. Wanton clumped together. Verdict: 2/5
Price is definitely more expensive than bkk but it kinda taste around the same! The noodle is pretty chewy and i super love their char siew and fatty ppl would love this place cos they have fried pork lard at the side for you to take! üòç lucky i came in the morning or else the queue would be pretty crazy!
You may opt not to have it if you are not a pork lard lover. üòÅ The noodle choice is either mee kia or mee poh. The queue is very long &amp; they are only open from Fri to Sat. Not sure whether the original version will be even better..or not. Will try it out in the next trip to Bangkok. üëçüëçüëçüëç
Yummy! But just a tad oily..
Yummy yummy and yummy! Delish bowl of QQ noodles with cured meats and char siew! Be prepared to queue for 30mins on weekends! :)
It\'s interesting to see Thai style wanton noodles in Singapore. In fact this is the first one I know. Eggy noodles and they servs dried chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar as condiments.
Noodle is pretty chewy but nothing to shout about.. Might go back to try the other stall, selling sliced fish beehoon soup. Most ppl were having that.. However, I must say this coffeeshop is much cleaner than usual and spacious too.
My favourite Thai Wan Than Mee, large at $5. Heavenly Taiwanese sausage slices.
so so... noodles quite q but the garlic oil dressing was a bit too plain for me. 
Nice with good flavour. Fried wanton makes me crave for more! :)
We still like this here at Soi 19.
What say you?
Aroi Mak Mak!
Thai Wanton Noodles (S$5)\n<br />Regular with extra ingredients \n<br />Pig üê∑ intestines (S$2)\n<br />Available at @Soi19ThaiWantonMee \n<br />The queue was less than 10 paxs in front of me as it was raining quite heavily when I past by yesterday. The serving looked üëÄ rather small in the huge bowl. The plain looking noodles was surprisingly tasty and bouncy. Quite like the chunky sausage, but the char siew was lacking of the caramelised taste which I preferred. The pig intestines was tender but still a tab powdery and slight bitter in taste.\n<br />Don\'t forget the condiments such as the crispy deep fried pork lard, green sliced chilli, and chilli flakes.\n<br />|\n<br />Soi 19 Thai Wanton Mee ÂçÅ‰πùË°óÈõ≤ÂëëÈ∫µ\n<br />Address üè† : Blk 151 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, # 01-3030, Singapore üá∏üá¨ 560 151\n<br />Tel ‚òé :  9138 8881\n<br />Open üíà :  Wed - Sun : 7.15am - 3.30pm\n<br />MRT üöá : Yio Chu Kang (NS15)
Yummy Thai noodles with succulent Char Siew, savoury sweet Lap Cheong and fried Wanton. Yum! \n<br />The dry noodles gotta be eaten with the chilli powder for that authentic Thai taste. And be sure to add more of those crispy deep fried pork lard b\'cos they were damn good. There were soup and dry versions but I personally preferred the latter for the spiciness. Also, order the large size for extra ingredients and noodles as the regular with extra ingredients just didn\'t have enough noodles for us. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #burpproved #thaiwantonmee #thainoodles #wantonmee
A large bowl is at $5. Nothing like a springy egg noodle with char siew for the weekend !
The so called \"Thai Wanton Mee\" so well known in Bangkok. Can easily have it in Singapore,but need to queue at least 30mins if you go during peak hours. However, there is still difference from the authentic stall. But the free flow pork lard is a plus point. Added side dish with pig trotters and extra fries wantons. Recently opened another outlet at Blk 130 Jurong Gateway Road. Good for foodies in the West. #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sginstafood #igsg #igsgfood #nomnomsg #foodphotography #sgnomnom #sgfoodgasm #foodstagram #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #foodie #whati8today #foodporn #eatoutsg #burpple #burpplesg #hungrygowhere #jiaklocal #recommended #sghawker #hawkerpedia #hawker #angmokio #lunch #soi19
productive sunday!
.\n<br />Loved the free-flow fried pork lard which bring out the rich aroma of wanton noodles. Probably the nearest style to Bangkok\'s which I can find in SG.

Soi Thai Wanton Soup @ $3.50 üëçüèª Verdict: \n<br />Love the springy noodles and well season wanton.

Soi 19 wantan mee!!! The wanton is mega love love
Thai Wanton Mee (688 calories / large bowl) - The calories in this dish is higher than your normal dry wanton mee because of the deep fried wantons, deep fried pork rinds and deep fried chinese sausage. Yes, it is sinful as hell but it tastes soooo good! ($3.50(S)/$4.00(M)/$5.00(L)). #yumyumyap #calories #foodie #foodporn #goodfood #yummy #sgfood #sgfoodie #singapore #local #soi19 #asian #thai #wantonmee
Overall, worth the 25min queue! #vscocam #burpple #foodsg #omnomnom #onthetable #whati8today
Loving their egg noodles and spicy level.
