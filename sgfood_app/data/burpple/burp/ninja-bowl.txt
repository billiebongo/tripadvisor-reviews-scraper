A bit disappointed. Tonkatsu was hard and not very crispy. Truffle mash was overpowering. Poached egg were just plain poached eggs. Not impressed at all.

Never any regrets when it comes to this Fancy French. I\'ve made no secret that this is my fave item from Ninja Bowl back when they first opened, and even amidst the newer menu additions I find myself most drawn to this. How not to, when you\'ve got an amazingly fluffy brioche ‚Äî homemade whatmore ‚Äî lots of fresh fruits (oh them figs ‚ù§Ô∏è), an epic fig jam, and a tangy-sweet ume syrup? .
Awesome!! Even the toast was good :p felt well worth the $18 spent for the amount
Shinjuku Comfort ($18)
And it was sure worth the trip down :) it was a delectable pairing of fig jam French toast drizzled in use-boshi infused honey and topped with fresh fruits. Major love for the homemade hazelnut butter on the side!! But we concluded that we don\'t like figs üòÇ #burpple #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #frenchtoast #brunch #breakfast
Took us few minutes to realise we were right outside Ninja Bowl because their signboard was cleverly concealed like a ninja üåö Food was healthy and quickly served. There was no service charge and the meal was fulfilling!

Caf√©s with No GST and Service Chargeüòç favorite bowl ever, all the favourites packed into one! Love everything in this bowl (-: \n<br />This is the Genki Bowl ($16) and additional $2 for a base. Though pricey, but worth every dollar! Quite a generous slab of unagi, with copious amounts of sweet pumpkin and the tartness of the beetroot cuts in really nicely. Always telling myself try other dishes on their menu but this wins me over every single timeüòÇ Love the service and atmosphere here (:
Really good but a couple of the couple were sliiiightly overlooked but still quite a satisfying experience as eggs and mentai go so well together.
Medium rare NZ Grassfed flank steak with sauteed mushrooms and cherry tomatoes and that onsen egg! Need i say more?\n<br />.\n<br />Happy Thursday all! üí™üèº\n<br />.\n<br />#ninjabowl #ilovemybeef

Fig jam french toast drizzled in ume-boshi infused honey, fresh fruits, homemade hazelnut butter
Check out the fancy French toast at @ninjabowl! Brace yourselves for the crazy brunch queue!
Oooo that super tender 24h braised beef cheek served with 2 Japanese inspired Okokomiyaki pancakes to add to the brunch feels.
24-hour braised beef cheek meets crisp Japanese savoury pancakes with 2 perfectly poached eggs to blanket the entire combination in a landslide of yolk goodness. Be warned that this is extremely filling, so come hungry.
A faultless dish of scrambled üç≥ on üçû, made luxurious with plump scallops and mentaiko. Scramble was significantly (I\'d bold+italicise+mega highlight this if I could) better than the first time I visited, and I must say this is a brunch item I\'d be happy to down any time. Scallops could\'ve done with lesser time in the pan and the mentaiko element can definitely come across stronger, but 4 big scallops at just $18? I got no complaints man.
.
Got a Tsukiji with Ninja rice (brown rice) &amp; Ebisu with toast. The scallops in the Ebisu is really quite yummy. Yes, nice marbled bowls there too! Give the iced chocolate a miss, I would say. #BurppleXChope
I just visited another restaurant that sells poke bowls! This one is called Yasai Bowl (with additional Garden Greens $2), which consists of the sultanas, poached egg, salmon cubes and cherry tomatoes. Other than for the salmon and the poached egg, I didn\'t really fancy this dish haha. For its value, I\'d prefer RO\'s more satisfying poke bowl üôÇ.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤: $18
Another one from Ninja Bowl is Gyu &amp; Tama! The 24-hour braised beef cheek blew me awaaaay, it\'s so tender and flavourful üòª I\'d definitely recommend this over the other one üôÇ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤: $17
Looks healthy but we had a side of truffle fries üòã. Nice thick slabs of tuna with baby tomatoes, asparagus, edamame and an onsen egg. Originally comes with pickled cucumbers too but I had them removed.
This is a love or hate thing. For me, I don\'t really know how to appreciate it. The taste was too much for me to handle.
Slightly on the expensive side but you get what you pay for! Serving was very generous and my friends and I were full and satisfied by the end of the meal! We went on a Saturday morning and I loved the ambience; perfect for catching up :)
I added greens to my ninja bowl, it was rly savory. I chose seafood because my blood type digests seafood better. The scallops were rly tender and chewy to bites. Mussels were a tad small but in overall, it\'s a kind of food I would go back for.
Tried the Sakana which is the newest addition to Ninja Bowl\'s menu. I love the generous portion of salmon, marinated cucumber, edamame, asparagus, onsen egg, carrots and we asked for additional avocado too.
Geisha Bowl ($14 nett + $3 for Quinoa)
Highly recommended! Best to mix it all up a lil together with the miso marinated asparagus and edamame. Boosts up the overall flavour tremendously. Pickled cucumbers add a zesty kick and crunch. Not forgetting the oozy goodness from the onsen egg that wraps up the entire ninja bowl experience. Haha.
Pun intended. Didn\'t order the bowls as I still can\'t get my mind around paying a ton for vegs, so I ordered from the all day brunch menu instead. Char siu with poached eggs (and a hunk of avocado) are something new, and the perfectly done char siu come in generous servings - not overly salty at all! Friend couldn\'t \'find\' the ninja rice he added though, the rice was a true ninja üòÇüò∞ So the bowls are out for me even though the flavour combis are daring. There\'s a unique chill out feel which made me feel like I\'m in another country. Everyone\'s in a loud, chill out mode too, so no whispering üòÉ
nah, the lightings were just crazy nice and bouncing off the pretty wood grains üòç
Not forgetting the slices of bread to soak up all the creamy seafoody goodness.
Kinda ex for an everyday office lunch but the HUGE scallops make it (almost) worth it. The lemon butter sauce is a bit salty so add some rice ($2) or quinoa ($3) to soak up all that goodness.

Ninja bowl does set all the right ticks with additional of flavours.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The beef cheeks had a soft but chewy texture and braised for 24 hours, it has adsorbed the right amount of Essence making it a bold savoury flavour. But fear not the Korean beansprouts and dried tomatoes will lighten up your taste buds. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The part that I don\'t like was the hard texture of the ninja rice, making it hard to swallow. Luckily, there was still the Onsen egg to save the day! \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, in my opinion. Ninja bowl may not be the best poke bowl on my list, but it is still decent. Maybe I should head to the new Sister outlet ninja cut to try out.
Back at @ninjabowl because they have good quality bowls which I wouldn\'t mind going back for!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Noka ($14) which consisted of 24h braised Beef cheek, Baby Corn, Korean Beansprouts, Mixed Nuts, Onsen egg and Sun-dried Tomatoes. I tasted a little bit of Red Wine in the beef, which gave it a tinge of bitterness, but the taste of the beef still quite strong. The beef cheek was also served in thin shreds!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />We also tried the Kabuki ($14) which was a bowl with Seared Honey Chicken Leg, Baby Corn, Korean Beansprouts, Picked Beets, Onsen egg and Fried Shallots. Chicken was well cooked and perfectly seasoned, and as always I really loved their Picked Beets hehe ü§ó
A healthy bed of quinoa and saut√©ed vegetable which a thick fat slab of unagi. What sets this dish aside is the runny onsen egg which is done to perfection. Service is fast as most ingredients are prepared and only require warming. Don\'t be taken aback as it still taste deliciously fresh. The coconut drink was Super refreshing especially in the hot Singapore weather. Hidden in Duxton, I would specially make the trip just for another bowl. Love this rustic cafe 
NINJAAAA! This cafe was so small, and it was located at the corner of the building I almost missed it! Ordered the highly raved Genki ($16) + Ninja Rice ($2), which consisted of Yaki Unagi, Roasted Pumpkin, Beansprouts, Onsen Egg and Pickled Beets. Really liked how the Unagi was cooked, so soft and perfect! The combination of all ingredients made this rice bowl exceptionally tasty. Didn\'t know I had to add $2 for the rice though, it should just be included with everything else!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />I also ordered the Poutine ($14), which was Shoestring Fries, Melted Cheese, and Beef Chunks. So unhealthy but ahh I couldn\'t resist! The melted cheese made the whole thing taste very much like a pizza, and the beef chunks were shredded decently. However, I didn\'t like how the plate was filled with oil and made some of the fries very soggy and oily. I hope this improves!
Fancy French ($15) - fluffy French toast, with homemade hazelnut butter, topped with figs and grapes. Elevated with an amazing umeboshi-infused honey for that light, sweet fragrance with subtle sourness, the entire dish was very well-balanced. Definitely a good end to the meal!
Pair it with a good cuppa coffee (beans by smitten). Not a bad way to start the week I reckon.

It\'s alright, kinda like a fancier daily cut. #howtonotbefat #burrple
Just look at that #eggporn. This is a place I\'d return to again and again for their healthy bowls, chock full of ingredients (plus a runny onsen egg) and portions that are just perfect for ladies. I\'ll admit, some guys don\'t quite take to this concept, but if you need to take a break from all the hawker food and have some clean food, this is the place to be! Prices are Nett ‚úåüèºÔ∏è
Because I wanted to try this after hearing so much raves. \n<br />I chose Yasai (SGD16) which consisted of salmon poke mixed with soy sauce and ponzu sauce, with balsamic tomatoes, mixed sultanas and onsen egg. I topped up with Ninja rice (SGD2) which is a blend of vinegared Japanese pearl rice and brown rice with seaweed flakes. \n<br />I love this! Such a beautifully plated dish which is yummy and healthy! üòãüòã
One for the veggie lovers, and one for the piggy lovers.
In a large bowl, there is a giant fillet of unagi, and little pockets of bean sprouts, pickled beetroot and roasted pumpkins around, topped with an onsen egg, all for $16 (net price bc there is no service charge here) One can add $2 for a serving of carbs eg. rice/quinoa($3) In the other large bowl, there is a 24 hour braised beef cheek, with baby corn, sundried tomatoes, bean sprouts and another onsen egg, all for $14 :-) this small cafe is definitely one to watch for its generous portions, tasty ingredients and lovely atmosphere. Who is up for seconds? üôãüèºüôãüèºüôãüèº
An adaptation of the glorious, gravy-laden dish where the light brown gravy takes centrestage, the Poutine ($14) at Ninja Bowl is taken up a notch with the addition of 24-hour braised beef chunks. Golden shoestring fries are layered with tender beef and drenched in a luscious sauce. While the melted cheese scattered amongst the fries does not scream \"classic Poutine\", it does the job. The portion is quite generous so share it as an appetiser among a few friends while you wait for your grain bowls ‚Äî we like the Noka Ninja Bowl ($14), which comes with the same braised beef (the more the merrier!) and a wobbly onsen egg, best.\n<br />Photo by Burppler Mok XC
Saw a number of burpple posts by fellow burpplees. Looks better than it taste. Truffle fries was a separate order for $12. The Kaisen don is $16 on its own, and you add another $2-3 for a carb base of rice/salad/quinoa. Tried once, won\'t be back. 
~\n<br />Now here\'s a thick French toast that keeps your waistline in consideration.\n<br />~\n<br />The brioche was fluffy soft inside with a thin crisp layer, covered in Ume-honey, topped with grapes, figs and plums.\n<br />~\n<br />Hidden beneath that golden layer as you slowly slice it open is a treasure trove of homemade fig jam, sweet-tart, oh so yummy.\n<br />~\n<br />The toast is lighter on the palette than most other, over the top sugar loaded thick toast but i did felt it would be nice to have a slightly more savory element to balance out all the sweet.\n<br />~\n<br />Overall still a great variation of the dish that hit all the right sweet notes.\n<br />~\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #ninjabowl

I don\'t even like unagi, but this immaculate fillet is so impeccably caramelised that it\'s hard not to be won over by it. And even better is that fuwa-fuwa heap of scrambled eggs padding the eel from below ‚Äì creamy, dreamy and just pure love.
Wanted a healthy filling brunch! Headed over to ninjabowl. Not too bad, we can use our mains with our preferred fillings like ninja rice(brown jap rice?), greens, quinoa or orzo (rice-shaped pasta). Price for two bowls were $32! 
‚òïÔ∏è Haha. Have a good start to the week guys. I think I left my mind behind over the weekends.. #burpple #coffee #mondayblues
16 dollars gets you figs, grapes, plums, fluffy toast all bathed in sticky sweet honey. üòçüòç (7.4/10)
\nGuarded all around by an unconventional army of edible flowers and fresh fig, plum and green grapes, this thick pillow of beautifully coloured brioche squirrels away a hidden treasure of homemade fig jam; possibly my favourite bit of the entire plate. But the special touches don\'t end there ‚Äì overhead, a knob of hazelnut butter slowly melts across the warm toast, while splashes of umeboshi-infused honey carry an intriguing blend of sweet, musky, and muted sour notes.
features 24hr braised beef cheek (aka lor bak). the sauce gave the rice more taste and easier to eat as well. once again nth fantastic.
the price quoted is nett but it does not come with rice. need to add $2. this place is super crowded for lunch hour and u may wish to make reservation. the sauce is refreshing but I won\'t order this again
Loved everything in this bowl. The Hokkaido scallops are huge and fleshy. My favorite part was actually the the ninja rice mixed with the lemon butter sauce. Enjoy eating here without the guilt! 
Dash of flavors in a bowl (can\'t get enough of the marble bowls used here!) Tsukiji ($16) for brunch that leaves you satiated without a heavy meal. Skip the Coconut Lemon Mint ($8) though, they\'re pretty bland and diluted.
estimated to spend at least $18 per pax. note tt price is nett
Fancy indeed! This is the eye candy that everyone would love to bring out on a first date. But halfway through, conversation dries up and it\'s awwwwwkward for the rest of the day. (Jelat lah, best shared with friends üëØ) The fig jam tries to keep it refreshing for as long as it can but there\'s simply too much toast. I still love it though, just maybe in a smaller proportion. üòã
Honestly? I didn\'t think much of it. You can read about why in my review.
This is the kind of bowl that I want to be eating as I stare out the window, snow gently pillowing outside and with a warm fireplace in the background. üç≤\n<br />Unfortunately, we\'re in tropical SG so I\'ll just have to use my imagination üòñ \n<br />The pan seared Hokkaido scallops were SPOT ON! Done just right and moist all the way through, even with the generous serving of four, you\'ll be like \"GIMME MOAR!\" Which sadly made the mussels feel like an afterthought üòù
‚öî‚öî‚öî\n<br />My favorite dish of the night:\n<br />Ebisu ($18 nett)\n<br />Pan-seared Hokkaido scallops, mussels, miso butter cream, and toast.\n<br />I love how the thick creamy broth brings all of the elements together into a lovely dish.\n<br />The portion is quite generous too.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks Darren for the lovely meal and @sixthsensepr for hosting us.
By the name of it, this french toast already sounds pretty! This is the brain-child of the owner‚Äôs wife, where a thick cut homemade brioche is stuffed with fig jam and then cooked till golden brown. I am absolutely in love with those brown charring on the sides of the toast which really lifts up the fragrance! The toast is then drizzled with an ume-boshi (pickled plum) infused honey topped with homemade hazelnut butter. Finishing touches include slices of figs, plums, green grapes, edible flowers and icing sugar to complete this beauty. The ume-boshi honey was definitely uniquely yummy and not overly sweet. Fancy french is a definite must-order either on your own or for sharing!
Ebisu ‚Äî a creamy seafood stew that is named after the owner\'s favorite district in Japan. The fresh pan seared Hokkaido scallops and mussels are soaked in an addictive miso butter cream sauce! Enjoy every single drop of the sauce by dipping the toast into it. \n<br />And oh, prices are nett here at Ninja Bowl! 
If you need to have your poached eggs when you‚Äôre at a cafe, go for the Tonkotsu Spirit. It‚Äôs definitely worth every single buck with 3 slices of Japanese aburi cha shu, melted cheddar toast, smashed avocado and 2 poached eggs. The cha shu was wonderfully tender with an appropriate amount of fats, though I thought it could do with more smokiness to increase its intensity. It was a satisfying treat with the cheese toast, creamy avocado and silky poached eggs!
The Tsukiji bowl is made of a seared tuna tataki, asparagus, edamame, pickled cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, onsen egg and furikake. Fresh tuna is flown in from Tsukiji Market so you can be guaranteed of its freshness. Taste-wise, I thought this was rather plain tasting and did not have any exciting highlights to shout about. It would be good for tuna lovers!
The Noka bowl is made of 24-hour braised beef cheek, baby corn, korean bean sprouts, mixed nuts, semi-dried tomatoes and onsen egg. The beef cheeks are braised in veal jus and homemade soy sauce into a rich tasting meat. While it was quite fork tender, I thought the meat could be smoother! The dried tomatoes and mixed nuts gives it a good mix of flavors and texture of this noka bowl! Ours came with the white quinoa which is such a healthy choice!
Yaki unagi with roasted pumpkins, korean bean sprouts, pickled beetroot and an onsen egg, over a bed of Ninja Rice. The well seasoned grilled unagi was flavorful and slightly sweet from the teriyaki glaze. The pumpkins gives the creaminess, the pickled beetroot gives the tangy kick and the bean sprouts gives a refreshing crunch. I had a little of each in one mouthful and it was so delectable!
Japanese aburi cha, melted cheddar sourdough toast, smashed avocado, poached eggs.
Finally convinced @timchee to come here but I think it will be the last time we will be coming here. He wasn\'t impressed with his Buta Bowl, where the pork was tasteless and the apple had too much ume. Initially I thought my bowl was quite underwhelming where my seared tuna needed more sesame, edamame asparagus was too salty from the miso.. Etc. But as I ate, I realised it was impt to eat the sides tgt as they really complement each other. Well I would come back again for their choice of quinoa/brown rice/orzo üòõ though it really taste like the food I cook for myself... Haha.

Fancy French $16, filled with fig jam within the French toast, then drizzled w ume-boshi infused honey, topped w fresh grapes, plums and homemade hazelnut butter. Wiped off this crusty French toast in no time. üçû
Featuring my favourite eggporn act with Tonkotsu Spirit ($16) - Japanese aburi cha shu, melted cheddar toast, smashed avocado and poached eggs. WHHAAAATT, ABURI CHA SHU! The thinly sliced pork belly was laid on top of the cheddar toast and the cha shu simply melts in your mouth. \n<br />Remember to mix the poached egg, cha shu, avocado and cheddar toast at 1 go, because I accidentally ate the egg on its own and it was kind of bland. Probably explains that the aburi cha shu is the highlight to enhance the overall flavour üòÅ\n<br />Find out more from the link from my profile!
Then we have beef cheek, braised for 24 hours, tender without quite mustering a distinct character. The meat bears no identity, holding no flavor on its own, rescued only by an army of baby corn, Korean bean sprouts, mixed nuts, semi-dried tomato, of course, an onsen egg.
My Kaisen Bowl was excellent üëç scallops seared perfectly and the mussels were really fresh! The fig toast was amazing üòç (though slightly pricey)
Of all the grain bowls that I\'ve tried from this rising trend, this is unfortunately one of my least favoured. It could be my personal dislike of overly buttery foods, and the lemon butter does permeates through the seafood umami. Scallops were good - plump, seared and abundant. However, there was something off about the mussels, kinda mushy and didn\'t seem quite as fresh? I did enjoy the ninja rice mixture of brown rice and pearl rice, different textures with a bit of furikake or seaweed brininess. But I will hesitate forking out $16+$2 (for the carb add-on) again.
The generous serving size of grilled Unagi glazed with glistering yaki sauce was a perfect combination with ninja rice! \n<br />Do you know that grilling is the most authentic way to appreciate Unagi in Japan? No wonder I find myself savouring the scrumptious unagi together with other healthy ingredients, particularly the crunchy Korean mung beansprouts that you can usually find in Bibimbap! üòç\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!

Teriyaki unagi, roasted pumpkin, pickled beets &amp; beansprout. Added $3 for quinoa. It was really good after I broke the onsen egg and stirred everything together! Unagi was so tender and sweet. Just wish there was a refreshing dressing like yuzu wasabi to bring all the ingredients together!

Had the Fancy French ($16) - fig jam French toast, ume-boshi (pickled plum) infused honey, fresh grapes, plums, edible petal bits and homemade hazelnut butter. \n<br />Do note that the waiting time for this dish is 20 minutes, as each part of the dish is made to order. What is unique about their homemade fluffy brioche is probably the stuffed homemade fig jam, which wasn‚Äôt overly sweet! \n<br />Thank you @sixthsensepr and @rachaelwong for the invitation!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile.
Tuna tataki, asparagus, edamame, pickled cucumber, cherry tomato, onsen egg, furikake.
Despite what the menu says, this definitely arrived in under 20min so we were still finishing off our Noka bowl. Even after sitting out untouched for a good 5min, the crust stayed.. Well, crusty, and kudos to them for ingeniously stuffing the middle to break the monotony of what would\'ve been quite a thick, bready layer. Not sure if many would take to the umeboshi honey; i wiped the plate off with toast expecting sweetness, only to be met with quite strong notes of pickled plum. But i liked it.
Closer shot because that pat of hazelnut butter deserves a shoutout !!
Oh, it\'s fancy all right. So fancy we had trouble keeping our allegiances straight.
Ah, I MUST COME BACK.
Yes, they may be labelled as atas \'cai png\', but the appetite for these colourful bowls shows no sign of abating. Ninja Bowl\'s contenders feature Japanese-inspired ingredients such as unagi (Genki, $16), tuna tataki (Tsukiji, $16), and Japanese aburi char siew (Buta, $14). The latter, although hardly a healthful option, was my favourite. One bite into the smoky and meltingly tender pork belly and I was sold. Heart, soul, and tummy.
{Fancy French} $16, of freshly baked French toast slathered with Fig Jam within, topped with homemade hazelnut butter and fruits. This brunch item is available all day with no limited quantity, expect to wait for about 20 mins as it\'s made-to-order. \n<br />Thanks for the warm hospitality @ccher @sixthsensepr @ninjabowl üç¥üòã\n<br />#ninjabowl #rachyyadverts
Started with Genki ($16), a healthy bowl of goodness with soft delicate yaki unagi, topped with roasted pumpkin, pickled beets, Korean mung beansprouts for the added crunch and a sexy onsen egg to mix together to heighten the flavor. One of my favorite dish of the night! You can also opt to choose hearty add-ons such as Quinoa, Ninja Rice, Orzo or Garden Greens for additional of $2 to $3.

Okay everything is fine separately, including lovely braised beef. But if the cheese is not springy and there\'s no gravy, it is NOT a poutine. Kindly take note.

The weekends are barely over, and here I am already craving some badass French toast - like the fig one we had two weeks back. Fluffy and moist, crisp on the outside, and just enough sugar to satiate my sweet tooth. Be sure not to skimp on the hazelnut butter, it adds a lovely depth to the whole dish! 
Popped by this weekend, and by jolly was I surprised by this. The flavours were stellar - perfect for those with an aching sweet tooth - toast was super crisp and moist, and that fig jam üòç loves. I liked that the fruits, figs especially, were slightly under-riped and tart, adding both a lovely crunch and contrasting flavour to the dessert dish. Only mini peeve I had, was that the toast was too moist on the insides and lacked that fluffy cloud-like sponge I would\'ve loved.
Have to agree with most that their French toast is really the only one worth travelling for. The rice bowls weren\'t as flavourful as others we\'ve tried: we opted for quinoa, which was bland and under-seasoned, and the accompanying ingredients didn\'t do much to help. Would rather enjoy a bowl at Grain Traders, at a lower price what more!

Juicy pan-seared Hokkaido scallops and fresh mussels are cooked in umami-filled miso cream sauce. You\'ll find bits of sundries tomatoes and onions, giving this dish bit of crunchiness/spiciness. They must had also known we can\'t get enough of the sauce as toast are served on the side, allowing me to dip in this fragrant and creamy sauce!
Time to dig into this fluffy French toast with fig jam, ume-boshi sauce, and almond butter! So daaaammmnn good. Where about? @ninjabowl GO NOW. Anw stay tune on IG and Snapchat for this weekend\'s decadent staycation at @stregissg! Can\'t wait!! See you in a bit.
One of their brunch item is this Gyu &amp; Tama ($17). This 24-hour braised beef cheek is intensely soft and tender, pair with a side of perfectly scrambled eggs. üòõ
Ninja bowl got you covered for a healthy fix like the featured, Yasai [$16]. I don\'t fancy quinoa but this dish changed it around, now I can deal with quinoa all over the ponzu soaked salmon poke. Accompanied by balsamic tomatoes, mixed sultanas and an onsen egg.
consists of generous chunks of fresh salmon poke steeped in a blend of soy and ponzu sauce. The side of balsamic tomatoes, mixed sultana and onsen egg gives you a well-balanced diet. Ninja bowls are served naked so you can choose to add $2 for Ninja Rice, Orzo or Garden Greens. Alternatively, add on $3 for the White Quinoa. Dishes served here are actually NETT PRICED without service charge!
CANT WAIT FOR THE LONG WEEKEND~ üíÉüèªüòÅ\n<br />Anyway, this beauty is from @Ninjabowl\'s brunch menu! Yup, they don\'t just serve up healthy bowls, they have a delicious brunch menu as well!üòãüëåüèª A good place to drop by this weekend to try more of the food here!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Gosh. Am I in heaven yet? That Ume honey drizzled upon the thick and SO FLUFFY BRIOCHE elevates the entire dish with an additional umami touch, and that fig jam within! IM IN LOVE!\n<br />.\n<br />üöá Outram Park / Tanjong Pagar. 15 Duxton Road. Singapore 089481. Where DOC was previously!
The Gyu &amp; Tama ($17) has everything that I love: flavoursome and brilliantly tender beef cheek that has been braised for 24-hours, scrambled eggs with shrooms and slice of toast to soak up the goodness. YUMS
Like the Ebisu ($18) which features 4 huge ass pan seared Hokkaido scallops and mussels in a creamy miso butter sauce with  fennel and sundried tomatoes! Couldn\'t stop mopping up that sauce with the salty and chewy porous sourdough. Dayums!! Too many likes from tonight\'s dinner. Check them all out on Snapchat @msskinnyfat! Look out for some serious #eggporn
ninjas eat good food!!!!!! if this homey new cafe is any indication üòâ the yasai bowl ($16) with added quinoa ($3) was pretty generous and satisfying--loved the marinade of the salmon sashimi, it paired beautifully with the onsen egg and tangy cherry tomatoes! texture of the dish was really good, i especially liked the contrast of the succulent salmon chunks to the quinoa grains, mixed with the runny onsen egg. my friend had the noka bowl ($14), featuring 24-hour braised beef cheek! last shout-out goes to the coffee here, which is excellent!! it had a pleasantly sweet after-note that was so addictive :-) will be back for their brunch offerings!

I was still satisfied with the compromise because I love Hokkaido scallops - I frequently buy them from supermarkets to pan sear them myself with butter and salt, or to air fry them after wrapping with bacon. \n<br />Most of the scallops here are well-seared, some less, and wasn‚Äôt too salty (I tend to pan-sear mine with too much salt). There is still some scallop sweetness within, unlike many restaurants that serve scallops that are almost totally deprived of any natural sweetness within them. Granted, there are many high end meals with really fresh scallops that are full of sweet scallop juices, but that would require fresh live scallops and not something you would expect out of this bowl that only cost $18 nett. I like the cream base, that has a touch of onion for a spicy accent. I like the maple that‚Äôs coated on the toast, but the toast was really tough so I would prefer them to be served slightly warmed to make it easier on my jaws. \n<br />This place is new so they are still improving operationally to handle the lunch crowd. I was however impressed by the sincerity of the service though. Although they were a little overwhelmed today, boss @hungrydarren was there to ensure everyone was well taken care of. I was standing at another table and chatting with them about their dishes (I happened to know them), and a server walked up and answered all my questions ‚Äì good initiative :)
I was searching for a lunch place that can accommodate 11 people with diverse taste for this Friday, so some of us went to Ninja Bowl and did a first tasting today.
Looking at the menu, it was an easy choice for me. Seafood lovers raise your hands with me! The Kaisen Bowl ($16) was filled with mushrooms, carrots, mussels, Hokkaido scallops and lemon butter sauce. There are several choices for the base. You can top up $2 for Orzo, Ninja Rice, Garden Greens while the Quiona is at $3. Price was really worth it considering the amount of fresh seafood. The four fat scallops were seared nicely and mussels were tasty. Carrots were sweet with a slight crunch but I\'m just not a friend of carrots themselves (ops heh). Hopefully I\'ll be able to swap it out for another veg during my next visit! I would also have liked more of the lemon butter sauce to pair with the orzo as I found it slightly bland.
Ninja Bowl takes over the defunct Department of Caffeine in Duxton, dishing out hearty, protein-based dishes at affordable prices. Come with your colleagues and share the Poutine ($14), unbelievably tender braised beef cheeks on a heap of shoestring fries. Then dig into one of their eight protein bowls. The Noka ($14), which comes with the same beef cheeks, is a must order. Another standout is the value for money Kaisen ($16), juicy pan-seared Hokkaido scallops and mussels served with lemon butter sauce, mixed mushrooms and carrots. The bowls do not come with any grains or greens, so if you need something heartier, opt to add the Ninja Rice ($2) in your bowl ‚Äî a mix of brown rice and Japanese rice. \n<br />Avg price: $20 per person
With all the talk about healthy eating and the movement that came along, stayed and wouldn\'t go away. The options these days are endless.
This is pure happiness on a plate :) Perfectly crisp &amp; fluffy shoestring fries, melted cheese &amp; a huge slab of tender, succulent braised beef cheeks. (YASSSS üêÆ) Great for sharing tho I wouldn\'t even mind having it as a main all to myself! If you happen to be feeling down, pop by &amp; order this. It\'ll definitely flip your mood around üòä 
While a typical poutine is served with cheese curds, this rendition came with globs of cheese melted in clumsy hunks. Yet, it really didn\'t matter much, this was still the bomb. Just simple, happy food! Fries were perfect, beef cheeks were melt-in-your-mouth gorgeous. And that zhup. Just make sure your friend helps you wrestle with the cheese! 
Comes along as quite an acquired taste, I guess this is alittle too fancy for my liking as  their umeboshi honey leaves a weird aftertaste in my mouth while the toast can do with alittle more TLC.
A beautiful sloppy mess. The 24-hour braised beef cheek is shamelessly tender; its gravy rendering the the two pieces of toast beneath into yummy soggy-ness. I can\'t imagine a better accomplice than the scrambled-with-mushroom eggs. 
How appropriately-named. These tempura-ed cauliflower florets were all too easy to pop into my mouth. I like that alone, they were clean-tasting and surprisingly non-oily. But if you are after more flavour, just dip them in the accompanying sriracha-laced mayo.
The usually wriggly eel completely lays limp in sweet, luscious surrender here, whilst elsewhere the various crunchy elements each bring something different to the table - the beets bring a veggie wetness, the pumpkins a hearty starchiness and the beansprouts a peasantly basic chewiness. 4/5
Fancy French [S$16] Fig jam brioche French toast drizzled in ume-boshi infused honey, fresh grapes, plums, homemade hazelnut butter. Newest cafe on Duxton Hill.
The onsen egg were a tad overcooked but great to mix it in with the whole grain Ninja Rice. \n<br />Great place for a ninja quick hearty lunch in the area, serving relatively good coffee to go with your bowl!
We didn\'t need much convincing after seeing \'hazelnut butter\' and \'figs\' on the menu description for this, but I really wish that they used a light and fluffy brioche instead of the fig jam bread. 
Opened at the former spot of Department of Caffeine is Ninja Bowls, which serves a variety of healthy lunch bowls and brunch, with a small selection of sides and sandwiches. Part of the brunch menu, it is described as a \"Fig Jam French Toast drizzled with Umeboshi-infused honey, fresh grapes, plums with hazelnut butter\". A pretty much acquired taste for this one; the toast wasn\'t as soft as expected for the toast did not really feel soaked into the eggwash, leaving much of the insides as it is being a tad stiff. The umeboshi infusion was also pretty subtle; barely noticeable and the entire French toast tasted much like an onslaught of honey and slightly nutty flavoured butter. It wasn\'t exactly bad, but rather just did not really deliver the expectations stated on the menu and could be more refined in the execution as well.
Where are my semi-dried tomatoes? üò¢\n<br />Nevertheless I have to commend the silky scrambled sublimity, and once again the super tender beef cheek; though the toast was in an unfortunate stale and weary state. 
We tried almost all the bowls on the menu and our top favourites are:\n<br />Noka ($14, not in the photo) with unbelievably tender braised beef cheeks, Korean bean sprouts, mixed nuts, semi-dried tomatoes and onsen egg\n<br />Kaisen ($16) with super plump scallops and mussels with lemon butter sauce, mixed mushrooms and carrots\n<br />Genki ($16) perfect for unagi lovers, with superb pickled beets, bean sprouts, roasted pumpkin and onsen egg
Add $2 for Ninja Rice/Orzo/Garden Greens or $3 for Quinoa. One of the more typical rice bowls amongst the Ninja Bowl selection. While I might urge you to try the other exciting bowls (unagi! beef cheek!), you can\'t really go wrong with fresh üç£ salmon üç£ sashimi 
A balanced &amp; delicious 6oz with lingering roasty, chocolatey notes üç´üç´ #coffeefix #smittencoffee #smittensg 
Not a fan of this Canadian delicacy in the first place, BUT that beef was really melt-in-the-mouth tender, give-you-a-big-hug full of flavour. Order this if you must rebel against the clean eating majority here; or just go for the Noka Ninja Bowl (with the beef cheek as the main). 
Opened at the former spot of Department of Caffeine is Ninja Bowls, which serves a variety of healthy lunch bowls and brunch items alongside a small menu of sandwiches and sides. I usually don\'t really order coffee from a place that serves salad, but they do serve a pretty mean cuppa here. The 6Oz is equivalent to a Flat White here, which comes with a medium body has pretty earthy and chocolatey notes, great  to start the day with. They use Smitten\'s blends for their coffee here, which explains the quality of their cuppa.
The four Hokkaido scallops had a taut, delectable crunch, while elsewhere the carrots possessed the youthful sweetness of a fat smiling baby and the lemon butter sauce enlivened the occasionally dry fried rice-esque quinoa. 4/5
Worth the almost 40-minute wait. (The whole thing, that is.)\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#Burpple #BurppleSG #food #foodgram #foodie #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn

Each component of the dish was done to standard, and they all came together quite nicely. Unfortunately, it wasn\'t one I would order again. I think it\'s the bean sprouts... just not my thing. üå±

It comes with a generous slab of deep fried pork katsu, poached eggs, ume apple slaw and trufle cheese mashed potatoes. I like the idea of the apple slaw which gives the dish a nice crunchy and tangy contrast. However I felt that the pork needed a bit more marination or seasoning for a lift in flavour.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #ninjabowlsg

The truffle fries ($12) are good too. Come on a Sat when the crowd isn\'t too overwhelming, but keeping in mind that they close at 6pm. #tingzieeats #burpple

Stuffed with fig jam, the french toast is drizzled in a ume-bashi infused honey sauce. Fluffy and sweet, this is best paired with the fresh grapes, plums and homemade hazelnut butter for a balanced finished. I would recommend this at the start of your meal or you have to wait for about 20 minutes for this.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #frenchtoast
Those faces at the back, \'Nuff said.
The highlight for me is the mini savoury pancakes which were crispy and packed with flavours. It is paired with the braised beef check, poached eggs, sliced red ginger and garden greens. I was hoping that I can change the poached eggs to fried eggs, which I felt will complement the okonomiyaki better.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #ninjabowlsg #Okonomiyaki

Should I get the salmon? The tuna? Scallop!? Finally opted for the kaisen..it came with 4 succulent pieces of hokkaido scallop which was perfectly seared.. Maintaining both moisture and texture :)..this is definitely the best part of the dish..the mussels were fresh and sweet but that\'s it.. Would be awesome if it\'s baked with garlic but I\'m just asking for too much :p.. The lemon butter sauce though was really good! Wish they would give me more :(..mushrooms were mehh.. Below par and I changed carrots to tomatoes :) My rating for this is 3.5/5..good effort but not enough to make me rave about it :)..till next time ninja üê¢.. #burpple #kaisen #scallop #foodsg #ninjabowl #duxton #ricebowl #japfood #worklunch

Price: $19\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Tanjong Pagar \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Currently taking over the former tenant Department Of caffeine (DOC), ninja bowl runs a healthy bowl and brunch concept. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The highlight for Yasai was the salmon as there were generous chucks of salmon given! üòã I just can\'t stop munching them! It may not melt in the mouth kind, but they were fresh. The other highlight was the onsen egg, when mixed well it gave the Quinoa ( seed, like cereal) a creamy texture. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />However, there were misses in the dish, the quinoa was a bit bland, maybe I am just not use to it? As for the sultanas (dried raisins), it was sweet, however there was too little of it. And Maybe they can put in some handmade sauces to go along?\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, it was still a decent experience and I have yet to try their French toast which is quite popular. Currently aloha poke bowl is still my favourite. 
Price: $16 + $3 \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Tanjong Pagar \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Genki highlight was the Unagi. It was uniformly caramelised and the meat was soft. Beside the Onsen, which I think it\'s one of the best creation, the roasted pumpkin was also great! Giving the dish its sweetness and enhancing the fragrance of the dish. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />I am still not use to eating the quinoa, maybe I should have just ordered the ninja rice (Japanese rice and brown rice). \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Oh! Do take note all price are nett. So don\'t worry about calculating those extra plus plus after your meal. I will be back for my next visit to try their toast and sides.\n
Finally tried @ninjabowl and all it\'s protein goodness. Not bad at all.
üçö
Wasn\'t overly impressed by the Unagi bowl but this was really tasty.  I\'d come back just for this.
been wanting to go for ages to try their delicious looking protein bowls. not sure if it was because of the hype, but I was slightly disappointed. not that it wasn\'t good (the braised beef was tender and the sauce, flavourful), but I guess after having had other similar and really #yummy bowls (though pricier and smaller) I was hoping for more delicious tasting components in these. portion size was good though and the meal felt #healthy and satisfying (S$14-$16 + $2/3 for grains, lettuce or quinoa) ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úåüèºÔ∏è#lunch #foodpics
Probably my favourite savoury item here ‚Äì an indulgent pool of miso butter cream inhabited by a briny community of tender mussels and chubby pan-seared Hokkaido scallops.

They do have unique flavors. This matcha cake had a layer of matcha filling and Yuzu. The Yuzu layer was strong and the cake was well moist.

Quinoa, grilled unagi, roasted pumpkin, onsen tamago and pickled beets
The Ebisu ($18) comes with 4 Hokkaido Scallops so plump and juicy, soaking in all that miso butter cream you wished you had more than just 2 slices of bread to mop up the sauce with! üòç
Definitely a good way to complement the bowls. Smitten beans.
4 munchies: One of my top picks from the latest establishment by The Astronauts Group, the carb-free Genki bowl comprises a slab of well-grilled Japanese eel, starchy roasted pumpkin, crunchy Korean mung beansprouts, tangy pickled beets, and an onsen egg. The Ninja Rice ‚Äì a blend of vinegared Japanese pearl rice and brown rice with seaweed flakes ‚Äì makes a great hearty add-on option for those after something more nutritiously filling.
NINJA BOWL sure is crowded, and getting seats would be hard without reservations, but for the nett prices and delicious food, all is worth it. The only thing better than these would only be the people having them, attracting all the attention in this cafe, snapping pictures and eating mochi/ wasabi chips. üòÜ
A seafood lover‚Äôs dream come true with umami packed sweetness to get your mouth watering. A must-try at Ninja Bowl - Featuring succulent and plump seared Hokkaido scallops along with fresh mussels cooked in miso butter cream sauce. Perfect balance, the glazed toasts was there to soak up all the rich luscious cream that was satisfyingly savoury and addictive. Yum!

It also comes with two slices of toast to soak up the delicious cream. I only visit there was more of the sauce.
Take the¬†Gyu and Tama¬†($17) for example, this contemporary partnership of creamy mushroom scrambled eggs with 24hour Braised beef cheek is easily a dream for any gym buff. Loaded with protein lauded with a good comfort kick from spices unleashed in the braised beef; this works well even for an early dinner

Braised beef cheek (soft, tender, moist, heavy), korean beansprouts, baby corn and onsen egg. We didn\'t add grains and shared this (but do bear in mind we eat like birds) and this left us enough room for the french toast. Gotta plan your meals wisely.
For a little more pep in my step - i chose the stronger of the milk coffees. Beans here are from Smitten.. Microfoam isn\'t as tight, and on first sip it\'s just overwhelming acidity.. But it then mellows and trails off pleasantly. Weak stomachs be warned.
It is paried with a side of creamy scrambled eggs, mushrooms and toast. It is one of the better scrambled eggs I have eaten for a long while.

I go for the quinoa and mix them up well
Fanciful indeed! French toast with layers of fig jam, ume-boshi infused honey,fresh grapes, plums and homemade hazelnut.

The French toast is stuffed with fig jam and then drizzled with honey that is infused with umeboshi (pickled plum) and topped with homemade hazelnut butter. The slices of figs, plums, green grapes and edible flowers not only make the dish pretty but also helps to balance the sweetness from the fig jam.
It is rounded off with baby corn, pickled beetroot, snow peas, onsen egg and fried shallots. We chose to add on the Ninja Rice ($2), which is a blend of vinegared Japanese pearl rice and brown rice with seaweed flaks. A substantial Japanese style mixture vegetable rice, in my own layman description.

Loving these hearty and healthy bowls that they serve at #NINJABOWL üòç this one with unagi, quinoa, beansprouts and an onsen egg is a fav of mine! ü§ó
Basically these bowls are carb free and comes with default ingredient combinations. However diners have a choice to add on the ninja rice, orzo pasta, garden greens and white quinoa for an additional cost of $2 to $3.
in fact I\'ve not even tried Grain Traders nor May May at that üò£ #imaginethat;  so my recent invitation to suss out @NinjaBowl and their infamous bowls really caught my surprise
- the {Fancy French} should put you in the right frame of mind immediately to visit the newish Ninja Bowl along Duxton Road

New fav feeding spot at duxton @ninjabowl! Never has a chicken donburi excited me this much. Review on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio.
The Ninja rice which is a blend of vinegared Japanese pearl rice and brown rice is the highlight of the dish. The variations in the texture and savor of the rice makes it really appealing and complementary to the rest of the ingredients
They were out of figs for the day and replace it with grapes. A thick brioche drizzled with honey topped with hazelnut butter. Beautiful and tasty!
This was the Tonkatsu Spirit, Japanese aburi Cha Shu on melted cheddar toast with smashed avocado and poached egg.

The onsen egg is soft and mushy while the mixed sultanas and tomatoes add a tangy flavour to the delectable bowl. The huge servings of the sides are an extremely huge draw

\"Fancy French\", an apt name for quite a thick french toast. Drizzled in ume-boshi infused honey &amp; topped with a dollop of hazelnut butter which was surprisingly sweet. Fig jam by the sides was tangy-sweet. My favorite were the figs, plums &amp; grapes. The toast was a tad charred at the sides. Unless you want a sweetilicious \"pick-me-up\" for the day, \"Fancy French\' will certainly satisfy your craving. It was, for me, alittle too much of a \"sweet thing\"üòÑ. But i know some will like this. Definitely will be back to try other items. #brunch #frenchtoast #fruits #hungrygowhere #i8mondays #8dayseat #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #bloggersg #sgbloggers #igers #igsg #singaporeinsiders #instafollow #tripadvisor

One of the better bowls at Ninja Bowl! Nicely seared scallops with mussels, mushroom and carrots! And it\'s healthy too! (Rating: üòÄ)
Opened at the former spot of Department of Caffeine is Ninja Bowls, which serves a variety of healthy lunch bowls and brunch items alongside a small menu of sandwiches and sides. Noka is described on the menu as \"24-hour braised beef cheek, baby corn, Korean bean sprouts, mixed nuts, Onsen egg and semi-dried tomatoes\". There is an option to add quinoa at $3, or Ninja Rice, Orzo or Garden Greens at $2. I opted for the Ninja Rice, which is a mix of Japanese pearl rice and brown rice. What makes this bowl interesting is the play of textures through the rice, especially since you get a healthy mix of rice and nuts that provides some crunch within the rice; soft without being overly mushy with a earthy and nutty mix of flavours. Then, you get even more crunchiness from the Korean beansprouts which was pretty refreshing. I am not a big fan of Baby Corn, but I absolutely love the ones from here; so fresh you could taste its sweetness despite the buttery flavour. The Baby Corn is also grilled slightly to bring out its natural flavour, and adds to a crunchy texture to the bowl and topped with furikake for an umami touch. Beef was tender, though more on the gamey side but the strategic placement of the sundried tomatoes seem to do the trick to mediate the gaminess with a tangy sweetness. Not forgetting that Onsen egg with a molten egg yolk that is absolutely delicious when mixed into the rice. I am not a big advocate of eating salads, but boy I guess I could eat this all day!
