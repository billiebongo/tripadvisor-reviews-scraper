Hearty plate of homemade bagel ($3.50), two eggs ($4), saut√©ed mushrooms ($4) and guacamole ($3.80). Everything went really well together! And lived the texture of the bagel and the guacamole was pretty impressive.
Min 25 dollar purchase gets you 10% off with dbs card. Great value for a quality coffee.
$9.50 each. Crusty light bread perfect with that soft egg and bacon!
Seemed a low key place where ppl came in for a quick bite or chill early on sunday. \n<br />Tables were quite grubby, as were the dishes and utensils. Disappointing as I tried Aussie places that were superb.\n<br />The fresh oj was VERY watered down AND padded with so much ice. When I removed all the ice, the actual juice was a third of the cup.\n<br />Chicken salad was okay, but pesto was obviously store bought and too heavily smothered every thing. Also only a few sprigs of sad green leaves..\n<br />Dont think i will return to try other items.
Fancy an al-fresco dining experience in the CBD? Sarnies is the go-to place. This blackened grass-fed sirloin dish ($25) is served with some pretty amazing truffle mash. This dish however didn\'t fare as well relative to the Sous Vous Coffee Kah Lua BBQ Pork Ribs which was superb-both in terms of taste &amp; tenderness. The truffle porcini mushrooms risotto was pretty decent as well! Not forgetting a pint a beer goes for 9bucks a pop here!
Sarnies has definitely got you covered if you require a good cup of joe. However, I reckon the tuna tataki salad($16) was just mediocre. I\'d say stick to getting a cuppa here or drop by for their dinner!
A huge ass sandwich. Substantial amounts of grilled aubergine and red peppers all sweet and juicy. Balanced with a nice slatter of hummus and feta cheese, just nice for flavour and not overwhelming. Fresh af mesclun greens give the sandwich a crunch factor so all in all, the parts come together to make the body whole.

üçù8/10üçù\n<br />.\n<br />This tasted like a creamier version of typical Indian curry (like the one you get as a dipping sauce for prata). An interesting spin of pasta sauce, with a healthy serving of 4 prawns and crispy laksa leaves. That said, it could get a tad too \"jelat\" after a while. (P.S. Yes this was a naughty break from my vegetarian diet :P)
üçÑ8.5/10üçÑ\n<br />.\n<br />Back on the vegetarian trail! This mushroom risotto was creamy and decadent. Some of the mushrooms were soft and chewy, but there were some that were dried and toasty - almost like bacon! The truffle taste was also pretty distinct. Definitely a classic dish done right üòã
ü•ó7/10ü•ó\n<br />.\n<br />A decent vegetarian option for lunch - the portion of zucchini, carrots, cashews, cabbage, capsicum, Abd spring onions is hugeee, and the peanut sauce flavour shines through. Only complaint would be that the zucchini could be cooked to resemble noodles more closely!
that\'s what she said!!! (cue loud groan of lameness and punch in the face)
Very generous portion of edamame, zucchini, bonito flakes, daikon, seaweed, and fresh tuna ‚≠êÔ∏è 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è.\n<br />‚ö†Ô∏è Very cramped, try to avoid the peak lunch period on weekdays\n<br />üìç@sarniescafe, 136 Telok Ayer St S068601
Had this porcini truffle risotto which was al dente and flavourful. The handmade pappardelle in Indian curry sauce was a familiar pleasant taste although the pasta was a tad too thick. Ended with their churros that were just a little over-fried but the burnt caramel sauce was awesome. \n<br />Overall, a hip place to chill at but somehow the people here seemed to like to talk too loudly within the small space. Perhaps too much to let off after a hard day\'s work in the office.
Home-cured bacon wrapped around a sphere of mozarella and truffle-scented mash. A savoury match made in heaven.
hand-cut pappardelle and prawns in a rich cream sauce that had more than a hint of cumin and curry. the pappardelle was great - good chew and held the sauce well. unfortunately i thought the sauce was a little too oily; there were small pools of oil forming after a while. go easy on the sauce and this dish would be better methinks.
Semblance of a balance. Time to load up on the greens before all that irresistible Chinese New Year-munching starts. üí´
Yes it\'s vegetarian but no you wouldn\'t be missing the meat in this one! Well if you do, there\'s also the pulled pork ones available. More on their dinner offerings on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio.
Sarnies‚Äô Spicy Buffalo Wings - It arrived looking fiery hot, with an aromatic smell of spices. For Sarnies‚Äô unique rendition of Buffalo wings, Chef Zak used 20 spices for the marinade before slow-cooking the wings for approximately 4-5 hours, followed by frying.¬†
Didn\'t get to go for my class cause I overslept. But was rewarded with (what I feel is) the best coffee in the Singapore and a crunchy bowl of homemade granola. \n<br />Really missing this #slowliving.
Loads of beef &amp; vegetables between two slices of white bread. Pretty decent but might becomes overwhelming after half a sandwich.
New addition by Sarnies is this coconut froyo, Cocowhip! It comes in a variety of flavours (chocolate, orignal etc), but the best part is their selection of toppings. I actually got a generous serving of macadamia nuts for that cup. How generous!
Their take on a prawn taco had fresh prawns, coleslaw, and a mango salsa wrapped in soft tortilla wraps. Though the prawns were commendably crunchy, they weren\'t exactly sweet, nor well-seasoned. Have those plain prawns paired with a creamy but depthless coleslaw, an overly sour (not in a complex way) salsa, and a limp wrap, what you get is a one-dimensional and flat dish.
I\'ve made no attempt to hide my disdain of their lunch sarnies; but this? Dayum. Hand-cut parpadelle that\'s bouncy, al dente, and ticks all the right boxes, tossed in an epic Southern Indian coconut-based sauce whose fragrance hits you from a mile away. I\'d say it packs a ton of flavours, but that\'s really an understatement. And those aromatic curry leaves? Sealed my tummy ‚Äî I mean deal ‚Äî for me. #Burpproved
Spicy Not-very-buffalo Wings: a medley of fragrant spices compactly and liberally coating the wings, lending to an unexpected crunch ‚Äî much like breading with spices in place of bread ‚Äî and a unique, complex flavour. Without the iconic butter-based hot sauce it\'s clearly no buffalo wings, but the spicy, lean yet juicy wings are no less epic. Something different and definitely one to order when popping by Sarnies for dinner!
Sarnies never disappoints! Love how strong &amp; tasty their coffee is. Latte &amp; Cappuccino both $5 nett each ‚òï üëç
2 slabs of fluffy pancakes drenched with generous serving of Greek yogurt, honey and berries. So good that it was all gone in less than 10 mins! Coffee was awesome too!
Hearty salads that fill you up. Moroccan Chicken Salad ($16) and Paleo Steak Salad ($17.50) for lunch. The Entertainer app is so enabling üëª
Whoever said healthy can\'t be delicious - this can challenge it. Moroccan chicken skewers with mint yogurt, cous cous and greens. \n<br />Hearty portion too ($16) - meat and more meat. Fast service too
Subtly chocolatey without overpowering the light refreshing soft serve, and also completely guilt-free! Got it with cacao nibs and Chia seeds for added crunch, and I love cacao nibs for their caffeine-like nutty flavour. Sadly it is pretty expensive, but it\'s a really nice treat! 
Do ask for their password~ this is pesto chicken salad. The chicken is surprisingly tender and soft. Totally not hard. I wonder which part of the chicken did they used! Anyways this was yummy! :)

Blending in well with the savannah wallpaper as background
Seriously godsend. Insanely aromatic beans, roasted to perfection with a suitable amount of milk that complements the mild acidity of the roast. The first sip of my Flat White ($5) got me thinking, \'What took me so long to try this?\'. 
took me forever to drop by sarnies cafe la. sure is crowded even at 9am. had your cuppa yet mates? good on ya!
Trying to eat healthy on CNY day 2 after days of bingeing.  Thank God @sarniescafe is opened today to satisfy my coffee needs.
There\'s something about sitting outside on the pavement of Telok Ayer Street with a good hearty sandwich from Sarnies in one hand and a coffee in another to start your Monday on the right foot. Opened by two Aussie siblings, Sarnies is a no-frills caf√© serving tasty, mammoth sandwiches and salads that has captured the stomachs of many office workers because it‚Äôs filling, satisfying and downright healthy in the most appealing way. At lunch, feast on an Aussie Grain-fed Beef Sandwich ($16.50) bursting with caramelised onions and mushrooms, or a dead simple, juicy, breaded Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich ($14.50) with mayo and rye bread. If a big bowl of salad is what you\'re after, then indulge in the Tuna Tataki ($16) flavoured with bonito flakes, soy and mirin, or the mountainous Paleo Steak ($17.50) that comes with a scoop of guacamole on top. Better still, go halfsies with your friend and share a salad + sandwich! Don\'t forget to finish off with a flat white.
Seared tuna, daikon, cucumber, edamame, spinach, seaweed, bonito flakes, soy, mirin. Flavorful yes, but drenched with dressing making it too salty :/ but love the crunch on the veggies üòÅ
A bit tough to slice the bread. The omelette left behind a layer of oil. Somehow reminded one of pan fried egg with onions at home with its char edges. Could not taste the cheddar in it.\n<br />Latte ($5)\n<br />Quite rich with a slightly chocolaty and bitter taste.\n<br />Available at @SarniesCafe\n<br />The place was packed during weekend. They ran out of bread soon after I ordered.

üò± Time is flying by way too fast. Need coffee and need to achieve more. &gt;.
Pricey for everyday lunches in the CBD but the portion was HUGE and it was delicious. Dressing packed a punch with quite a strong wasabi taste. Perfect finish provided by their excellent coffee. 
I felt a little less guilty eating this but would still prefer the texture of other froyos. However if you like ur yogurt super airy, you can give this a try.
The word \"Sarnies\" is a British/Australian slang for the word sandwich, so needless to say, this cosy establishment serves up a variety gourmet sandwiches such as this signature Bacon &amp; Egg Sarnie with Tomato Relish! *yums* (For a full review, check out my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg)
This place boasts that their food is top-notch quality, and rightfully so! Here is their super delicious and hearty Fry-Up with Eggs, Shrooms, Baked Beans, Sausage and their very own Home-Cured Bacon! (For a full review, check out my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg)
‚ãÖ\n<br />#Sarnies #Brunch
Juicy breaded chicken chunks, crunchy roma lettuce, creamy mayo, on fragrant rye bread.
This coconut soft serve melted so fast! (Or it could be the crazy afternoon sun.) And it is pretty pricey considering it\'s $6.50 without toppings and any additional toppings ranges from $0.50 to.. $4? I opted for cacao nibs ($2) for its crunch but it was so bitter I felt a little miserable eating this plus the kinda bland tasting soft serve. I guess I don\'t do healthy üíÅüèª
This \'guilt-free\' coconut soft serve from Down Under is now available in sunny SG! Made with coconut water, bio-fermented coconut powder (probiotic) and vegetable-sourced stabilisers, the texture is just a teenie weenie bit icy yet still surprisingly smooth considering there\'s no dairy used. 
I got the original flavour with 2 brownie quarters, sweet Cacao Nibs and Apple Pie syrup ($13.84). Ouch, the price...\n<br />The coconut soft serve was richly infused with coconut at 0% sugar level, yes - like the kind of sugar level options you get to choose at Koi. Suddenly, we find ourselves fighting over the apple pie syrup and sweet Cacao Nibs that provide us with the comforting bits of sweetener.\n<br />Using only coconut water, the gluten, soy and dairy-free dessert seems to be the perfect answer for the health-conscious people as well as people like us looking for a guilt-free dessert. \n<br />I guess I am not that healthy to begin with, so I would rather indulge in sinful desserts to satisfy my sweet tooth. And hey, they could be much cheaper too!
It is dairy free, gluten free and 97% fat free!
Slightly top crusty warm chocolate brownie is perfectly fudgey and moist with melted chocolate inside the brownie, yet not too sweet. One piece of this sinfully rich warm brownie is definitely not enough for me!
@sarniescafe may just be the fix you need!
I managed to squeeze a visit to Sarnies this morning as I was around the area. After hearing a lot of good reviews about Sarnies and The Lokal, it was one of the places I must must go before I leave SG. The cup of flat white I had was really good with strong acidity which is my favourite! The bacon, eggs and toast was really good too. Toasty bread, and VERY crispy bacon! It was a hearty breakfast indeed. Love that they open early and it\'s so quiet in the morning :) 
The piccolo latte is strong and somewhat savory (like a hint of sea salt). This Sydney-inspired caf√© serves one of the best coffees I\'ve tried in Singapore. Friendly staffs. Good vibes. Definitely a place worth coming back to. üëâwifi availableüëà üìçnearest station: a Telok Ayer
$16.50 nett, with mushrooms, caramalised onions a little greens and steak sauce. Steak was a little chewy but so well marinated, juicy and chunky, I enjoyed this quite a bit! Had the wrap cos they ran out of sandwich.
It was too rich, too chocolatey and too fudging good. Can I have another piece please? üòÅüòçüòã 
Was skeptical till I took my first bite. The brownie at Sarnies gotta be the fudgiest brownie ever!
Sarn-day morning, shadows forming.
Starting the day right by eating breakfast! Ok technically it\'s something I probably can cook at home. But it probably wouldn\'t taste as nice because I\'m a disaster in the kitchen. Here\'s some smoked salmon, happy sunny side-up &amp; proper toast with a pretty good cuppa.
Mash Potato balls that comes with stringy melting cheese and wrapped with bacon sitting atop an avocado spread. Addictive with savoury and buttery flavours with every bite, it is like Takoyaki but with western influence.
This egg and bacon can share among 2 ladies. Very big portion. Simple dish yet nice with their tomato relish sauce. 
choosing from either salted caramel or chocolate dip, the sticks here and we\'ll fried. rare trace of oil and a rather chewy centre.
finally satisfying this lingering craving. \n<br />pumpkin risotto at my favorite place @sarniescafe . a pity they didn\'t have my favorite mushroom and bacon risotto but this one was equally good. a tad salty due to the parma ham was all was good with the dried chilli skin and generous serving of pumpkins and maybe some lavender
eggs, mushrooms, baked beans, home-cured bacon, sourdough toast, and a real sausage
Looking for a somewhere to chill out on the weekend? Cozy and relaxed, Sarnies is perfect for that. The food is good too - had the fish taco (pictured) and their \"f-ing good\" brownie was well, f-ing good ;)
Still the best brownie in my books. Fudgey, chocolatey and moist but not too sweet to the palate. Pair it off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for the added satisfaction that will never go wrong. 
Thanks Kenneth for the pour. It\'s great to be back here.
I must say, good choice to myself üëè I love how the Cajun flavour is just right and the chicken meat is sooooo tender! I love that the meat is still warm when served to us. The cheese sauce (I think) goes pretty well with the chicken though! Once you eat, you can\'t stop! This is really really good. üëçüëç two thumbs up! üòÑ I wish I\'m having this for lunch now! 
Looking for something light to share (or maybe even have everything to yourself!)? Sarnies is the place to go! Tried 2 dishes, first being the pulled pork tortilla. The tortilla was filled with purple cabbage, tender marinated pork and guacamole. I wish they could be more generous with the avocado goodness! The second dish was the Cajun-spiced kampong chicken, which was cook to perfection. Juicy, full-flavoured and piping hot when served. Yum! Would love to give the other dishes a go next time!
I love how this taco is filled with all these ingredients. I\'m not kidding. It\'s really full and bursting out of the taco. Good but I do hope that the ingredients could have been richer. It\'s juicy enough and I love the cabbage and avocado (I think!). The pulled pork could have a little more taste. To me it\'s just some strips of pork. I\'m a person who loves richer taste in my food. Walkable from Telok Ayer Mrt (Blue line) 
Really mammoth sized salad üò≤ and interesting flavour of latte! Really swarming with people today üò∞
Sarnies\' take on kong bak bao. Pillowy-soft buns and luscious, glossy, fatty pork. YUM.
The pulled pork wasn\'t as lusciously juicy as i\'d hoped, but the cabbage was crisp and crunchy, and the lime threw in a refreshing zing. A steal at $8.50!
Just bursting with fresh, natural flavours. The zucchinis were tender, still retaining their bite and the tomatoes were tangy and fleshy. And boy, that immaculate presentation. I am officially raving.
it has recently dawned to me that to even be able to brew a good cuppa choclate takes lots of precision. been recently trying out different iced choclate at the various cafes only to come out disappointed.  what\'s a good cuppa chocolate to you? to me, it must be more choclately den milky. the right amount of ice cream or cold milk to cool the cuppa. there shouldn\'t be ice. your take?
The Big Breakfast platter equivalent at Sarnies. Eggs comes in two choices, scrambled or fried. Toasts were crispy, and the gamey yet spicey baked beans created a great savoury-spicy taste for the toasts. Sauteed Mushrooms are soft and earthy, and the bacons were crisp while the sausage is lightly spiced as well. Definitely brunch fit for the king!
It\'s no wonder people love the coffee at Sarnies; it\'s light acidity and robust flavour profile simply is the best of both worlds!
Flaky and light, the pastry was also buttery goodness packed with two sticks of soft chocolate which smears itself onto the pastry when cut. Simply wonderful!
it\'s TGIF again. slept to quite horrific news about another MH crash again. this highlights de need for all to really do what you want in life. #mh17 on a lighter note. mocha and churros goes well together. sarnies coffee. üôåüôå my fav
yay to a new dish here and we are so fortunate to be one of de first tasters. athough abit chewy but its not oily. something im quite particuar with . worth a try
Made to order tasty dough sticks ($8) are now available at Sarnies.
Coffee has given me realistic and unrealistic expectations of productivity. Sharing my first-ever collaboration with Ladyironchef read on more on the link http://www.ladyironchef.com/2014/07/how-to-make-perfect-cup-coffee/
their juicy and tender roasted chicken. served with mustard and spices. I have really grown to love this small cafe hiding along telok ayer.
Croissant with  home-cured bacon &amp; scrambled eggs. Croissant\'s light, flaky &amp; buttery. The thin, crispy strips of bacon\'s so addictive! The scrambled eggs a tad overdone thou\'.. A wonderful brunch to kickstart my day!
There\'s something about sitting outside on the pavement of Telok Ayer St with a good Caesar salad and a coffee, having a long, slow breakfast/brunch/lunch at whatever time you wake up on a Saturday or Sunday. Sarnies is perfectly laid back, and is just what you need after a long week at work or school. Don\'t forget to finish your meal off with their killer brownie!
Steak sarnie and salad coupled with double shots of awesome coffee. I wouldn\'t mind eating these everyday.
serving great good desserts and affordable wine. being spoilt this fine thurs evening.  it\'s TGIT!
But I\'m sure it will on the permanent menu soon.
The first bite was absolutely divine, the rich melted chocolate in the middle leaking out in viscous streams. So was the second. And the third. Then it felt like I\'d hit a rock, literally and figuratively, where the solid chocolate remained just that - a block of solid chocolate. Still worth a try, I reckon, though it\'d be a lot better if they\'d thrown smaller chunks of chocolate into the batter.
Beef, mushrooms, caramelised onions and a dab of mustard. Simple but well done. Portion is huge, please share. 
I hardly get to eat this sort of easy Aussie-style food because of the lack of options in my office area, so I was really excited to visit Sarnies with Alain (from Burpple (hahahaha inside joke)) and a couple of other friends on a recent half-day off. The hearty portions and fresh flavours didn\'t disappoint, my favourite being the nutty homemade pesto that brought out the sweetness of the shredded chicken. 
yes. melting choc inside de brownie.  complemented with some ice cream I dare say it\'s one of de best around de area. wonderful lunch with good company. few more hours to de weekend. press on!
yes have been eating alot this week. here: pesto chicken salad from none other den sarnies.
These Swedish meatballs are made of dreams x I\'m so in love with the blackberry jam and celeriac mash. \n<br />By the way, @SarniesCafe is now on @Instagram Do follow them and don\'t forget to hashtag #SarniesCafe
My top trusty cafe for some serious bacon and plants, with some butter as side dressing. Winner!
They actually use a double shot ristretto for a single espresso. Very intense.
Cafe with personality I would say. A quaint little cafe with the hippie feel, a cafe that you could spend the whole afternoon in with such friendly and warm staff. Their pancakes are really good too!
Sarnies is prized rarity for sandwich cafes located around CBD. The brownie here is very good! It is moist and has the texture of a home-baked cake, yet it does not crumble like a dry cookie. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/sarnies-telok-ayer-street/
Thank you Zal\' and team Sarnies for the superb service; this is what keeps me coming back. Much appreciated guys!
a salad. not any ordinary salad. at just 16bucks they have a huge portion of meat, cheese, vege and bacon. very sumptous.  a must try and much tastier den de sandwich
nothing but high praise. I love tt right amount of burnt flavour in everyone sip .. elsewhere pales in conparison. an addict soon maybe? my poor pockets.
finally gotta chance to try this tiny cafe along telok ayer. roasted chicken sandwich. the bread was good. the ingredients were slightly disappointing. overall quite nicely done.
Continuing my search for the best croissant. This is an excellent one!4.9/5!!My favourite cafe for food!! üòçüòç

A bowlful of goodness with streaks of yummy grilled beef, fresh tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, onion rings, greens and guacamole on top. One of my top favorite on the Sarnies salad menu.
It was really hot the day we made our way there, so we sat indoors. It\'s really a place you can spot from a distance, with the wooden tables and chairs fully occupied outside. I still prefer the hot chocolate at D\'Good Cafe, not only because of the beautiful art but also taste and size of the drink. My sis prefers coffee at Nylon.
My favourite cafe in SG currently due to their home-cured bacon and generous portion of food. Walked from Dhoby Ghaut to Telok Ayer and I\'m famished. Delicious butter and guacamole. Next stop for coffee -  La Ristrettos or Artisan Boulangerie Co. ? Decisions decisions decisions.
Hot, strong coffee saves the day!
This is good stuff! 
Hahahaha. Ok, we were playing with the bacon and guacamole la. So fun!
On top of a flat white and an espresso macchiato, all for $64.50. So cheap!!!
After this, we \"hopped\" to Ronin(at Hong Kong Street) and did not have a pleasant experience there.....Ronin has no lack of customers definitely(Third cafe set up by the owner, after the Plains and the Bravery.), we have no lack of cafe to go to as well. üòí Definitely my first and last visit there, but not for Sarnies!!‚ù§ Sarnies!!
Both of us asked for 1 serving of butter each. Yums!Fantastic n friendly service!Too late to drink coffee just now, must try their espresso next time!!
I should have these Asian Sliders for dinner. It seems like they are the hot new food trend to pop up in cafes. Most people called them Kong Bak Pau. Photo Credit: Sarnies
3 Straight days at Saries! Happy HUMP Day lunch at my fave cafe with my new friend Milly. My Greek salad and her Hummus rye sandwich!
Ensuring that you\'ll be full and satisfied, Sarnies does healthy in a really appealing way. The Chicken Caesar Salad is commonly mentioned as one of the best salads Burpplers have ever had, and it\'s hard to resist the Aussie Grain-fed Beef Sandwich bursting with caramelized onions. What\'s more, Sarnies is helping you start 2014 right with a 100% Paleo Steak Salad with Guacamole. Best part is you don\'t have to feel guilty tucking into their beautifully fudgy brownie and a cuppa flat white after ;)
Remarkably clean finishing with a dried fruity profile. Balanced and well integrated acidity with a lively mouthfeel. 
First lunch of the new financial year, back at my fave Aussie style cafe. My big crunchy chicken caesar salad with mixed greens, parmesan cheese and sarnies dressing, roasted chicken, croutons, and generous serving of crispy bacon. Absolutely good stuff and I also recommend their sandwiches!
The Big Fry Up at Sarnies shared with Sherry. One of the best big brekkie platters I\'ve ever had. #burpple #instafood #foodporn
Happiness. Simple as a glass of iced cold chocolate. Bitter-Sweet-Love!!!
My huge-ass Hummus sandwich for lunch. Rye bread with eggplant, greens, roasted red pepper and feta! Healthy choice for the vegans, but be warned the sandwich it\'s really huge!
Chunks of chicken marinated in pesto and tossed with salad greens. Not bad. :)
The Chicken Caesar Salad is really good! Nothing ever disappoints at Sarnies! üòã Loves!
had to go back for another burger - it\'s @meatpackingdistrictsg \'s last week at bestway!
How I wish it was the weekend already....... &amp; it\'s only monday üò≠ always love hanging at Sarnies, good food, friendly staff, cheerful vibes. Makes you leave the cafe with all smiles :D
The damn good brownie again at Sarnies! Ôòã
Mustt try!!!!
Back to one of Burpple\'s early hangouts. People, get notified.

Just try the tacos and beef steak. Do order medium rare, its really tender and juicy.. best dish on the menu. Skip the buffalo wings, salt is free here till you can\'t taste the chicken. Brownie is not bad too but as usual its overly sweet. \n<br />It\'s a place to chill though.
After all the festive feasting, it\'s time to eat clean! Enjoying the Paleo Steak Salad @sarniescafe with @this_is_avril &amp; her mummy. Such a hearty bowl of goodness- fresh greens, grilled beef steak slices &amp; guacamole for $17.50. \n<br />Rating: 5 / 5

It may not seem appealing but you will think twice once you place it on your taste buds. \n<br />To all those who love chunky chocolate, I believe you will love this! The top later is crispy then followed by the warm chunky layer. It\'s advisable to share because it may get gelat.

Finally managed to dine at lunch and use my entertainer app. This place is crazy crowded during lunch hour. I like how it\'s really filling yet not heavy on the stomach. Although i can\'t pretend I ate healthy since I broke my coffee fast and caved to a flat white. Spied the salads which looked protein heavy and carb light. I know what I\'m going to spend my last voucher on :)\n<br />#sgrestaurant #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sandwich #sandwiches #lunch #cbd #telokayer #burpple
The balls are crispy on the outside but still moist in the core due to its fillings. Don\'t forget to dip into their Arrabbiata to spice things up. \n<br />Ps. I still cannot wait to try their C4 bombs.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #cafehopping #sgfood #sgcafe
For such a price, I\'m not impressed. 
The shop has proven to be quite popular among the working class nearby. You could see people drinking as early as 6pm.
Brought a friend to what to my humble opinion, one of the best brownies in town after lunch at Dojo. Nothing beats how Sarnies does their brownies here; all fudgy akin to eating a bar of melted chocolate that is thick and rich with a crusted top.

luckily for me, I\'m a cafe food kinda person and I\'m willing to spend on quality food, so it\'s really not much of a problem for me. one of my fave hideouts is at @sarniescafe where you are not only guaranteed delish food but also amazing coffee! here\'s proof of their Smoked Salmon Sandwich, nothing so fanciful that it breaks your bank, and not too big a portion that puts you in a post-lunch food coma üòè GOOD TUESDAY MORNING EVERYONE ‚òÄÔ∏è @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @sarniescafe #sarnies #sarniescafe #latergram  #getstimulated #brunch #smokedsalmon #sandwich

Have heard quite a fair bit about Sarnie\'s brownies and since we were in the area, why not? Brownie was rich and smooth, akin to eating a bar of chocolate for it seemed like a well balanced bittersweet chocolate ganache, but it\'s how crusty it was that caught me. To be really honest I have had similar brownies in terms of the rich and smooth consistency, but this is the first time I have had one which comes with the crusted top despite achieving such textures!

And to top it off with a caramel dip-perfect way to end the day. #rachfoodadventure #igsg #sgdessert #sgfood #burpple

The food\'s nothing to shout about, but the latte\'s worth a second visit. #sarnies #singaporecafes #cafehopsg #coffee #cafe #coffeeplace #coffeegeek #coffeelover #cafejunkie #instacoffee #coffeeaddict #coffeeholic #coffeelove #ilovecoffee #latte #latteart #burpple
a pinch of cinnamon dipping with either the salted caramel or chocolate sauce. \n<br />crunchy outside yet chewy inside, this would be the numerous time I have raved about this.
Value for money! 
Today mood still a cup of hot mocha. 
Monday down, 4 days to the next weekend! üí™

Roast chicken with guacamole salad 
Tried the cappuccino in this place which cost me $5, I felt the coffee is just normal and nothing special about it. As you can see there\'s no coffee art as well. Haven\'t got the chance to taste the food yet, will review again next round. By the way this place is small and easily get packed, 1-2pm is the best time on Saturday as it less people. Once it get crowded it will be superb noisy as the place is small, to be peaceful it\'s best to sit outside.
üòÇüòÇ\n<br />*I must be crazy to drink tea here. üòÖ The camomile tea is equally üëç though!!
This is one serious pancakes dish! Despite looking deceptively small plated, it can really fill up a stomach! The various flavors from the many fruits, ingredients and yogurt create a very zesty, sour and yet hinting sweetness to the whole dish! \n<br />#burpple #sarniescafe #cbdcafe #cafesg #shophousecafe #pancakes
Coffee at Sarnies are quite good most of the times but most probably because of the different barista around, there are times at which the quality aren\'t that ok. Today is quite good! Nice good coffee taste with good amount of chocolate! \n<br />#burpple #sarniescafe #cafesg #cbdcafe #shophousecafe #mochaart #mocha \n<br />Photos credits to @oftokyonparis Didn\'t took any today as busy eating and chatting thus gotta digged from tokyo\'s image archive.

Amazing size and tasted great! Rather expensive for an omelette but is really hearty and enjoyable! \n<br />#burpple #sarniescafe #cbdcafe #cafesg #shophousecafe #openfacesandwich #omelette
It always feel good to have breakfast at Sarnies on weekend morning. The quiet CBD streets with a mixture of old shop houses and modern tall highrise office around, create a very nice contract feel. And with the many foreign people around makes me feel so \"English\". Lol! \n<br />#burpple #sarniescafe #cafesg #cbdcafe #shophousecafe

A rich, full-bodied, almost chocolate-y quality. One of the most solid coffees i\'ve had recently.
Finally got the chance to head to Sarnies! The store isn\'t very obvious, so I almost missed it! Coffee was done just right with milk at the right temperature! üòä Wanted to try the churros but was too full, till next time then! 
‚ô§queen of my heart‚ô§see it?
The smoked salmon bagel with cream cheese was softer than expected and didn\'t attempt to take my jaw off chewing on it. I actually stole a sip of my cappuccino (I couldn\'t resist!) before taking this photo, hence the smudge. Love the coffee. #mars #vscocam #coffee #breakfast #sarnies #bagel #singapore #burpple #foodtrail
Caffeine fix this morning~~full bodied latte with medium acidity, hints of carbony &amp; nutty aromas. Slight bitter aftertaste. 
BACON!!

Looks good, no?
Stay positive and have a good day ahead(:
Couldn\'t help to notice this wall mural.
Haha. I\'m not complaining though.

Not mine though. :)
Sarnies will be collaborating with The Lokal, which I heard it is all about using the best raw ingredients to make the kind of food that everybody loves. The Lokal is soon to open sometime in June. Coffee will be from Sarnies; could this possibly be Sarnies number 2, let\'s wait and see!
Can\'t get enough of this.
Grass fed steak sandwich, which @trulysherena could not finish(huge huge portion). It was my pleasure to lend her a helping hand after my steak salad. Muahahaha. Yums.

Whiff of chocolate, with a rush of sweetness and balanced by a crisply bitter finish.
