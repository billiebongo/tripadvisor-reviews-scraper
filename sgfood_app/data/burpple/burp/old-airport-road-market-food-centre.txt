Delicious Hokkien Mee, with really really spicy Chilli. What makes it different is that it is rather dry than the usual wet Hokkien Mee. The unique flavour will definitely be from the Chilli sauce, that adds up the kick to the Hokkien noodles. 🍜\n<br />•\n<br />Located at Old Airport Road Hawker Centre, it is a must try if you like dryer versions of Hokkien Mee. 😱\n<br />•\n<br />Have a good Sunday everyone!

Thanks Michelle for bringing us these SUPER CUTE mini pineapple tarts! 😍😍😍 You wouldn\'t have guessed that they came from a hidden little bakery (Xin Tian Di Bakery 新天地) at the Old Airport Road Food Centre!
Decided to take a trip down to my favourite hawker. Mini vegetarian soon kueh &amp; png kueh plus the mandatory popiah. Life is indeed good~
偶尔也可以放纵自己吃一吃\n<br />.\n<br />On holiday mood so we came all the way from north to indulge these yummy hawker food at Old Airport Road Hawker Centre\n<br />.\n<br />We order Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee, Satay (peanut gravy with pineapple 😋), Rojak and Po Piah. Now we are so full ☺️. #cuisineparadiseeatout #sgfood #hawkerfood #foodblogger #burpple #foodpics
Was already suspicious this was not the original stall. It looks nice but unfortunately taste wise I will not give a second chance.
It\'s been a long week rounded off with an even longer weekend. Hope everyone gets some good rest tonight – myself included – and wakes up refreshed and energised and ready to take on the new week!
Unkai Japanese Cuisine has been around for a long time, but its only this year that they\'ve decided to dive into the choppy waters of expanding their shores into serving fresh seafood.\n<br /> \n<br />At $15 for a half dozen, this  plate of hotate tobiko yaki is acceptably affordable and the scallops ain\'t no slouch in the size department either even after being grilled to greatness. 
Like this bowl of lor mee from Xin Mei Xiang Zong, which was worth the full 40 minute wait. And this cup of Teh C Kosong from Toast Hut that came with a 15 minute wait.
Food is very nice with think crispy chicken and very nice and special chilli paste. Choose the sunny side up eggs and vegetable of the day to go along. Price confirm affordable.
And so the weekend started. The mango soybean($1.50) tasted divine and melted in the mouth. But the Bandung soybean($1.80) topped the mango. Very light, melt-in-the-mouth-custard like, perfect amount of sugar, this is undoubtedly the best way to drown out the weekday blues and make way for laid back weekends. #healthy #soybean #yummy #love #weekendstarts #missbae
Everytime I think of this stall I feel like laughing! Can\'t help to think of lau fu Zhi! But all jokes aside, this plate is very good! I always think they are just hype and for the pple I know who tried this, they all say it\'s average.. But it\'s good! One of the better ones.. It really has the \'old skool\' uncle fry on the \'push cart\' taste! Sweet, savoury, slightly bitter and also the wok hei flavor! Excellent!
Mushroom Minced Meat Noodle
Famed for their eat-until-cannot-talk-and-some-can-cry chilli, Yi Ji\'s Hokkien Mee ($4) is nicely fried but those that prefers a slightly wet version may not find it here. Though i heard friend say their outlet at Kovan does it wetter. 
This plate of fried goodness is full of 料 like prawns, fish cake and lap chiong (Chinese sausage) and wok fried with Kway Teow and yellow Mee to give that slightly charred flavour that just have you coming back for more. The Uncle has been frying this for decades and his Daughter quit her restaurant job so that she can take over the reins from him to continue bringing us this delicious dish for many more years to come #BURPPLE #tastytastemakertour @burpple
There was a mini- queue (7-8 people before me) form. Stall #01-81. Went for the $4 Lor mee. (They have $3/4/5/6 options). Their boss was super friendly and you can ask for as much vinegar, garlic bits and condiments as you want! The best thing about this Lor Mee is that it\'s packed with lots of real semi-fried fishes and less of those fake starchy stuff. Satisfying breakie! Xoxo, wet tissue no have

Batter free, just crispy skin goodness with traditional bun. :-) hard to find nowadays.
Just something simple.
#01-28 Xing Li Cooked Food. Can hardly taste the starch! This is $4 portion, must go for the largest portion instead! So satisfying. 
[Cho Kee Noodles, #01-04] - $4. Overall nothing outstanding imo but decent enough. Noodles were springy, thankfully not the super q kind where I take forever to chew. Charsiew were slightly on the drier side (where da fats?), wantons were not bad but preferred the normal ones to fried cos it wasn\'t very crispy and skin was rather thick. Not very generous with the fillings but I thought it tasted quite good. \n<br />#burpple
The rendition here comes only with kway teow and beansprouts, does away with the sweetness and the black soy sauce, focusing more on the savouryness, which that tasted great with Chinese sausages, fishcakes and prawns! The wok hei can definitely be tasted in this one, which turned out to be very strong!
Shortcrust pastry ✔️, but even better is how deep the tart base is, which means a super generous egg filling as well. Officially my fav egg tart in SG 😋
Not only are the food loved by locals, they are done in the traditional way in good taste.. not so much like the commercial taste elsewhere in food courts.. Out of the way for me but I\'d definitely hope to dine here more often..
The looong queue was really worth it!! Lovedddd the fish pieces in this lor mee that I would gladly queue another 30 min for :&gt;
There are quite a few stalls selling them, some having longer Q than others. I believe they are all good, while I will be taking some time to try them out. #burpple
Needless to say, one of the BEST kwaychap around Singapore. They have now opened another stall at Ci Yuan CC Food centre.
Big and generous serving of grilled fish with 2 sides, just less than $10, an affordable version of Astons. Must try!!
It was the BBQ aroma that brought us to the stall. We bought 3, one for each of us there but it proved to be insufficient. The wings were well marinated and roasted so nicely that I finished every possible part of it, especially its glistening skin. Cooked upon order, you can be sure that your wings would be served piping hot! 
If you loved the whole pig literally, come here to this awesomeness of braised pork they have! 
Go to Old airport road and eat lor (mee). Lor mee may not be my bowl of noodles (get it? Haha), but when I do have a feel for it, I get it from Xin Mei Xiang. Their noodles are always cooked al-dente, sauce and chilli pack a punch, and topped with a generous amount of fresh fish and pork belly! So satisfying that I just wanted to sleep after lunch hahaha
Slurping on a piping hot bowl of Blanco Court Kway Chap in this cold rainy weather. Loved the smooth Kway submerged in a lovely savory \'Lor\' soup and the fragrant and unsalty kiam chye on the side. I also enjoyed how well cleaned the intestines are (no funky smell or weird looking bits, unlike at some stores).
happy 2016! messily arranged photo because i couldn\'t wait to devour into the dish 😁 wanted to satisfy my Kway Chap craving so i went down to Old Airport Road Hawker Centre for breakfast. i usually order mine from a stall called \"Blanco\" (i think?) which was closed when i went there today, so i found another stall. the soup had a strong herb taste, which i don\'t really like. not the best bowl of Kway Chap, but my craving for it was way too strong!

Our lunch the other day. I love zinc!!!I mean oysters...And then curry chicken wrap for snack from Brawn &amp; Brains after this. 😍😍 #Flatlay #Hawker #HappyMonday #Lunch #YourSingaporeFood #JiakHiddenGems #Jiaklocal #Burpple #Egg #Oysters
THE BEST EVER!!! The gravy is FANtastic! It\'s light and different from other Rojak. They even added this ginger flower which added so much flavor 😋 will certainly be back for more of this! ITS A MUST TRY! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🙃🙃🙃
My dad had this , and I tried a bit. Must say it taste good! It\'s rather light on the stomach :))) 
Really interesting to eat this style! Must I must say it\'s rather overpriced... $2 for one roll (had one mushroom and one char sew) and $3 for the otah one. But it\'s still good on the taste buds, smooth and soft, and the gravy is light! Good to give this store a try... But Mayb not too often😅
This stripe of prawn roll costs $3. Minced pork &amp; prawn wrapped in bean curd skin then deep fried to crispy. Marinated with lotsa chinese spices, flavour is strong but overall lack the crunch from waterchestnuts. Old Airport Rd Food Center Stall 01-112 •
Cheong fun texture is very soft but tastes very powdery (粉粉的). The char siew bits is coarse and tasteless, not those char sweet ones we have at dim sum sessions. Otah, simply just otah. Oh well, what do we expect from a $5 plate??! •
The skin is thin but the pork filling inside not flavorful enough. Thus broth/juice from the meat lack sweetness • Old Aiport Rd Food Centre 01-109 •
Single scoop of coconut ice cream + sticky rice + honey mango 》$5.90
Blanco Court Kway Chap has been around for a long long time.. Offal lover like me would fancy a bowl of hot flat rice noodles with this, in the morning! #kwaychap #offal #oldairport #hawker #hawkerfood #hawkerpedia #blancocourtkwaychap
How was it?? As expected, it was YUM! Perfectly cooked spaghetti with bacon and mushroom in cheezy-creamy carbonara sauce. Portion wise, i think it\'s a bit huge [same problem i have with most of the food here in sg 👀] so you might wanna get someone to share this bad-ass. And oh, It was yum kinda creamy without being too heavy until you have 20% of it left on your plate 😂. but still - it was good!\n<br />-\n<br />🍝 Carbonara [Spaghetti]\n<br />💰 S$6.00\n<br />🏠 Pasta Manna\n<br />📍 Old Airport Road Food Centre, [01-84]\n<br />🚅 Dakota
Honestly, sincerely, it was really awesooomeee...!!\n<br />If you haven\'t tried it yet, well i really think you should.\n<br />-\n<br />If you\'ve been here before, you might notice that this thing is everywhere.. either on the tables, or on it\'s way to one. Curious enough, I tried ordering one and it was a very good decision.\n<br />Asked mine to be more spicy, and the auntie did very [VERY] well.. the crunch, turnips, chili paste, popiah sauce, and dash of cucumber was just great. Another thing is, you know the thing with popiah is that sometimes the roll size could be a bit too much? Well this one is just right! So each piece can go straight into your mouth without making you look like a glutton.\n<br />-\n<br />Definitely made it into my fav list! 😍😍😍\n<br />-\n<br />🍴 Homemade Popiah\n<br />💰 S$1.50 each [😍]\n<br />🏠 富城食品 Homemade Spring Roll\n<br />📍 Old Airport Road Food Centre #01-94 [i think they do have some brances tho]

There\'s froyo in the heartland hawker stall! The yogurt is more to the sourish taste. For the large cup, u get to choose 2 toppings, 2 fruits and a sauce for $5. Cheaper alternative to llaollao. I adore their chocolate sauce! Cos it doesn\'t harden when comes to contact with the yogurt. I totally love it! #jogurtz #oldairportroad #hawkerpedia #froyo #yogurt #dessert
Opened just 10 days ago at Old Airport Road hawker centre is \"Waan Waan\", a new Thai ice-cream stall (#01-51). I got the Mango Sticky Rice which comes with a scoop of their housemade mango ice-cream. But I couldn\'t resist adding on a scoop of their coconut one for $2 more. Am so pleased I did that because both turned out to be wonderful - really fruity in flavour, coupled with a smooth, thick, creamy texture. Served in the half-coconut shell were also very sweet cubes of mango (they had been frozen so I could feel the crunch of minuscule ice crystals), a small mound of sticky rice and roasted peanuts.\n<br />Yes, to pay $7.90 for a dessert in a hawker centre seems a bit much but my tastebuds had a party. So I consider it money well spent.\n
[Old Airport Road Food Centre] Besides the usual hokkien mee, wanton mee and chicken rice, you can even get frozen yogurt now in a hawker centre. Bizarre but true. However, I have to agree it\'s a smart move as there will always be a crowd and rental is relatively lower as compared to a retail space in a shopping mall. Is this a recipe for success which will kickstart more entrepreneurs to set up unique stalls in our local hawker centers? The major stumbling block I would say is the right target audience. For example, setting up a frozen yogurt bar in Old Airport Road Food Centre is appropriate as there are many young working adults or students patronizing there on a regular basis. Furthermore, by pricing your large froyo at $5 ($1.95 cheaper than llaollao) is a good tactic and in the long run, Jogurtz can maybe expand their choices of fruits and toppings to better compete with llaollao.
..\n<br />Got my first \"Jogurtz\" from @jogurtz after coming across @stormscape photo!😊 I guess this is probably the only yogurt stall in a hawker centre? Do let me know if you know any more of such stalls ok?👌🏻\n<br />..\n<br />..\n<br />Have a choice between $3.50(choice of 1 topping &amp; a sauce) or $5(4 toppings &amp; a sauce)! Is it worth it? I think it is pretty worth it for the amount of fruits &amp; toppings given! I will prefer more yogurt though because I left with so much toppings at the end of it.😁 Simply post a photo of their yogurt on Insta/FB to get a 50cents discount right now!😉\n<br />..\n<br />..
The fresh prawns, chewy yellow mee and tasty soup is a great way to spend the Saturday by. But beware of long queue at times.
1.5 munchies: Besides the large prawns, the other ingredient that caught my initial attention was the immense lard covering a quarter of the bowl. Not only the prawns were overcooked and soup lacked depth and sweetness, the chilli sauce was flaky and one-dimensional (basically just oil &amp; spice). I felt silly and obviously dissatisfied to have waited for something below mediocre for 20 minutes.
Another food trail with my aunt but her recommendations this time round were not as spectacular (not complaining I still enjoy time spent with her very much
From Ah Ying Wanton Mee. Wasn\'t really my style of wanton Mee because they seemed to have tossed it with sesame oil which I am not a huge fan of. Char Siew were in really tiny slices, so the full flavours of the char siew is hard to detect, and the wantons came with punt slices of meat that again was hard to taste. Given the sheer amount of wanton mee stalls here, this needs to improve to make themselves stand firm in the right competition.
Char kuay Teow so perfect! Alongside with oyster omelette! Best visit to the hospital! 
Yes, you read that right. At Pasta Risotto, it\'s only $7.50 for the seafood risotto, and you can get an authentic taste of Italian risotto in a hawker centre. The stock is rich and full of flavor ( I suspect they use lobster bisque as the base), and the rice is done just right. They are a little stingy with the seafood for the price though, but hey, it\'s still good eating.
[Old Airport Road Food Centre] There\'s a saying that food brings people together. I totally agree with that as it has led me to find many like-minded friends whom we can talk for hours over food. And the best part, we can share the calories by ordering from several stalls and take our time to layout and photograph it without bothering about the weird stares of others. See you both tonight for more feasting!
You might have to wait a while for your food but it\'s worth the wait.
4 munchies: While the noodles had great texture, I\'d have liked the char siew a bit more charred and fatty. The standout element of the dish was the chilli for me - zesty with a hint of sweetness from the char siew sauce.
Be prepared to queue and be rewarded for your patience with a delicious bowl of lor mee that i rate as one of the best in Singapore.
Not sure if anyone else is like me, but I prefer to have Kway Teow rather than the conventional Mee Kia when I have my Wanton Mee (I generally dislike yellow noodles of any form). Here\'s Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wanton Mee, ranked one of the tops in Singapore and I can understand why! 
4.5 munchies: Noodles firm to the bite, generous ingredients and most important of all, the sweet and fragrant stock made from fresh prawns and anchovies! Even though I prefer my hokkien mee with red sambal chilli, this was so good that I could make do without it and still felt satisfied after wiping the plate clean.
Last week\'s table situation while I Munch with #munchingmarc and #hawkerhopping with Uncle Julius \n<br />What we had:\n<br />1)Old Airport Rd famous Lor Mee\n<br />2)Nam Sing Fried Hokkien Mee\n<br />3)Handmade Chee Cheong Fun\n<br />4)Hougang Wanton Mee\n<br />5)Whitley Rd Prawn Noodles\n<br />6)Refreshing Soursop Drink \n<br />Have a good weekend! 🙌
3.5 munchies: While these rice noodle rolls with barbecued pork and prawn fillings were freshly made as promised, I\'d have liked the silky skin to be slightly thinner and a stronger flavour of the light soy sauce. Compared to the char siew that was fragrant and well-marinated, the prawn roll was, unfortunately, bland and not as fresh.
Springy noodles topped off with juicy char siew pieces, small dumplings and cubes of crispy tasty pork lard. There, I am in peace. 😍
.\n<br />|\n<br />If you are looking good and cheap seafood, old airport road hawker centre is a good place to start.
This Thai wanton noodle at Old Airport Road market serves very Q noodle and delicious wanton! It tastes nice as wanton noodle just that it is lacking the Thai-ness..... Irony is its cooked by Thai! But definitely worth the try if you are a fan of Thai wanton noodle. 
This wanton noodle has its own nostalgic taste! I love the old-style way of doing wanton noodle and really reminded me of the good, old days kind of wanton noodle! 
This Lor Mee at Old Airport Road is by far the greatest one I have ever tasted! The concoction of chinese vinegar and the \"lor\" or sauce is amazing! 
But sadly it\'s  standard had dropped since the last time I tried.
THE BROTH 😍 this one is 5 bucks but it\'s worth upsizing to the 8 bucks one for considerably more 料!! 
The uncle recommended this bowl of fresh prawn mee and as if to prove his claim, he just stuck his hand into this tank full of prawns, picked 3 out and threw them into the boiling hot pot. I just stared in disbelief. With such freshness guaranteed, the prawn meat was indeed firm and juicy. The prawn broth was rather flavourful, but slightly too oily for my liking. 
East-bound day and decided to drop in and discovered this old signature stall. Serves up great noodles with such a sweet and rich soup stock, you can\'t stop SLURPING. 😍😍😍
Prices are at $4/$5 for a plate.
Craving for some HK-style Chee Cheong Fun so went to the nearest one after having my regular cuppa. As much as I like the one I have at Chong Pang, this one seems to be of more adequate thickness, therefore absorbing the light soy sauce better. Not to mention the prawns here are actually bigger and fresher too!
Such comfort food, way better than any branded fried chicken.
Soul food
The soup is so good!! The prawn is so fresh!! Ooo yummy!!!
Like the quiet one in class, you don\'t really notice her, especially with her more popular friends around. But when you do (she\'s at #01-83 of Old Airport Road hawker centre), you\'ll discover her delicate beauty that is light and sweet.
Some indulgence in local food before I leave for my work trip. Xin Mei Xiang Zheng lor mee\'s queue was too long, so I settled for Xiang Ji lor mee instead. I like that it has huge chunks of fish and wu xiang and pork but the stock could be slightly tastier. For $3 you can get fish unlike the other store, so not really complaining either! As for the rojak, it loses the crispiness very fast, but I love the slight citrus taste in the rojak sauce. 
Standards are back! The previous time we had it the prawn broth was not fresh not sweet, but overly oily. So glad they are back on track again, and for an affordable $8, be prepared to feast on fresh \'red-feet\' (angka) prawns that are sea-bred and thus have that distinct sweetness to it. Fingerlickin good! Don\'t forget to slurp up the broth that is overflowing with prawn roe! 
Tiong Bahru Lor Mee; With $5.00, you\'ll get a hugh bowl of Lor Mee filled with sliced pork, pig skin, egg, fish &amp; a sticky well flavoured gravy.  
The best chicken wings I\'ve ever eaten. More importantly is the chili like woah it complements the chicken so well and even goes well with other things! Definitely a must try there!
Located at 51 Old Airport Food Center. 01-77, Ying Ying Beef Noodles.
I seldom have dinner at this hawker centre (I\'m usually here in the daytime), so perhaps \"Foon\'s Thai Recipe\" stall (#01-65) has been around for a while but it\'s my first time noticing it. I decided to order a bowl of dry noodles to try since it looked promising.\n<br />Unlike Singaporean and Malaysian styles of \"wanton\" mee, there\'s no chilli \"sambal\", tomato ketchup or dark soya sauce anywhere to be seen. However, I found the clear, light and sweet-ish sauce that the springy noodles were dressed in, to be really tasty. Of course the glistening bits of crunchy fried pork lard helped as well :) For those looking to dial up the heat of their noodles, there\'s sour chilli sauce, dried chilli flakes and pickled green chilli available.\n<br />As I was there around 8.30pm, just before she closed for the day, the hawker said to me that the \"char siew\" had run out and was it ok if she gave me extra \"wantons\" instead. That turned out to be a good thing - those \"wantons\" were large, juicy and delicious. 
Gelato paradiso is having one for one promotion for all their items from 2pm to 6pm on weekdays! I got this full waffles with 6 scoops of yummy gelato at only 11 bucks! 
This is from my dad\'s stall. Located at 51 Old Airport Road Food Center. Unit no. 138! My dad starting following my grandpa to do CKT since he was 12 years old. Many of the customers claims that my dad\'s is like a cross breed of Singapore CKT and Penang CKT. So don\'t expect to have too much dark sauce in it. My dad uses fresh prawns and squids which he goes to the wet market early in the morning to choose all of it himself! He also makes sure that supplier gives the freshest and big cockles. He also cooks the pork lard from scratch! $3 and you have abundance of ingredients in there! Fish cake, Chinese sausage, Chinese chive, beansprout, cockles, prawns and squid. Opens daily from 8am-1.30pm.
A night of Lao Fu Zi Char Kway Tiao, Handmade Chee Cheong Fun and Toa Payoh Rojak. Too full to even move. Enough to feed 3.
Every time I go to OAR Market I have the preliminary intention of eating something new, but this always, always gets in the way! I just can\'t resist not ordering it, slurps
The owners are friends of my Dad, actually we are neighbors. Haha! Whenever I patronized their stall, the friendly couple would always ask how everyone at home. Their satay are as nice as the owners. They are famous for their pork satay! Why? The meat is usually sandwich between this piece of luscious fat! It\'s very well balance. They made their own satay sauce. Every day, uncle would cycle to the hawker with two big pots of satay sauce. The sauce is thick and tangy and the highlight of the sauce is grated pineapple! Go ahead and start drooling now!
Stall name is Western Barbeque. All sets served with fries, baked beans, cucumbers, tomatoes and butter bread! Chicken chop is dope! They uses 1 entire chicken leg for 1 serving! Very juicy! They are know for their garlic sauce! But garlic sauce comes with pork chop only. But regulars like me will always request it on whatever we order! You can even top up with a sunny side egg! Cheap and good! $5.50! They have another outlet at Bedok.
Food presentation for hawker food, this is really very good looking.
I had green apple &amp; chocolate! Both really good flavors! 
Wanted to order pork rib but I say wrong number and end up with pork tail 😕 but pork tail tasted abit like pork leg. 
Prawns are delicious and big,broth is delicious and will make you love it
Fried Carrot Cake! This is really good! What makes the best carrot cake? It\'s how tasty the carrot cake itself. A major turn off of carrot cake who get the cake that is being mass produced in factory. Home made from scratch is still the best!! Yi Sheng Gong Fu, #01-99, 51 Old Airport Road.
Unit 01-98, Whitley Road Big Prawn Noodle. Got the $5 for medium-sized prawns. And this was amazing! From the fresh, succulent prawn to the rich, thick broth. If only they served my bowl with soup to the brim, instead of a half-filled bowl of soup. 
Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee at Old Airport Road is one of the few that I eat. I like it because it slightly on the wet side. Seafood is fresh. I like it simple, sliced red chili with soy sauce and lime!
I am waiting for my flight to Ipoh and I will be makaning alot of street food and cafes for these 3 days. Thank you @feelingthelightandtime for driving me around to introduce all the good makan places. If you have any recommendations in Ipoh, let me know! #MTCinIpoh
Good things come to those who wait. Especially when it comes to Old Airport Road\'s Toa Payoh Rojak. With more than 40 years of experience, they\'ve mastered the art of making excellent rojak. The uncle attentively grills the yu char kueh to a crisp over charcoal, ensuring that you don\'t get soft, soggy pieces in your rojak. The combination of condiments is almost perfect, and the prawn paste they use is the star. Rojak is one of those dishes that you don\'t get bored of eating, because of the contrasting textures and flavours you get (sweet, sour, spicy, salty) with each bite. 
There are two kinds of people in life: those who like their hokkien mee wet, and those who prefer it dry. But Nam Sing may just please both crowds. Each spoonful brims with the aromatic, umami-rich prawn seafood stock that has been patiently fried with the noodles. Served simply with cut red chili, soy sauce, squeeze the lime all over to brighten up this dish, and slurp up this perfectly moist plate of noodles. Give them a ring before you go down, or count on your luck for them to be open, as they close the stall as they wish.
Trust the perpetual snaking queue at Xin Mei Xiang; a favourite among many. The rich, intense prawn-based gravy is just viscous enough to pleasantly coat the noodles without being cloying - add black vinegar to bring it to another level. The noodles are topped with the standard braised pork, ngoh hiang, egg and beansprouts, they also include fried snapper flakes that lend a great texture. The key here is patience, you\'ll get to the front of the queue eventually.
I have eaten enough food to last me the whole week 😵
A good alternative for lor mee if Xin Mei Xiang is closed or the queue is too long. Taste &amp; style is quite similar. 
When you visit the Fu Xin Cooked Food stall (01-142) in the morning, you can sometimes spot the hawker at work, making each \"kueh\" by hand. This laborious process means the skin is a little thick but softly chewy (the texture reminds me a little of mochi). \n<br />My standard order is one piece each of the \"soon kueh\" (filled with chunky strips of turnip, dried shrimp and bits of pork) and \"koo chye kueh\" (filled with beautiful deep green chopped chives). For your dining pleasure, the hawker will cut up the \"kueh\", before pouring lots of \"tee jeo\" (a molasses-like sweet black sauce) and a sourish chilli sauce all over.\n<br />Besides these two types, he also makes others such as \"zhu bee png kueh\" (filled with glutinous rice). I have seen quite a few customers cart away several boxes of his traditional creations at one go for home parties. 
Here is something you don\'t see everyday: a hawker stall selling gelato with an \"authentic premium Italian taste\"! They prepare twelve flavours daily but at any one time, there\'re eight on display. The young and enthusiastic co-owner manning the stall encouraged me to sample whatever I liked, and so I did. Of what I tasted, the \"Biscottini Cookies\" and \"Strawberry Cheesecake\" came out tops. Considered as \"premium\" flavours, they cost an extra 50 cents on top of the usual price of $3 per scoop. I had to settle for just the \"Strawberry Cheesecake\" eventually as there wasn\'t enough left of the \"Biscottini Cookies\" in the container to make up an order. (Note to self: must come by earlier if I wish to have this extremely popular flavour next time).
Second best wanton mee I\'ve eaten (first is at Hong Lim) &amp; I love how they use a thicker noodle compared to the slimmer ones
So many stalls with \"no pork no lard\" here. Uncle said he uses lard for this, thus I decided to order from this stall. My 7th egg for the day. Love this hawker centre, shall plan a day trip here soon!
Can you believe that \"Dong Ji Fried Kway Teow\" (stall 01-138) has been around for nearly half a century? That means the elderly gentleman has been frying his noodles for longer than most of us have been in existence! When I hear the \"kling kling kling\" of his spatula hitting the wok as he fries, I already salivate in anticipation. A potent\"wok hei\" flavour and the addition of chives makes his noodles really appetizing. #hawkerpedia\n
My favorite Chee Cheong Fun, very fine skin, and bouncy prawn, in perfect soy sauce, not to mention the fascinating making process. (Rating: 😍)
This stall always have crazy queues but luckily there wasn\'t one cos I went early. Marinade was really sweet. The peanut sauce, however, was quite good!
First time trying this stall. Not a fan of \"black\" (sweet sauce) style carrot cake, but their\'s really quite nice. Have \"wok mei\" (鍋味）
Hands down, one of the best hawker centres in Singapore. Even tourists are brought here by the bus loads. Try the lor mee, prawn mee, minced pork noodles, char kway teow and chee cheong fun stalls.
Crispy honey-glazed skin which was semi-sweet also came with a tinge of smokiness from the grill. Loved how savoury and juicy the meat is, though it was a wee bit greasy. This was at the Old Airport Road Food Central but they have other outlets elsewhere as well.
Best with a plate of white rice. The raw onion gave the dish a freshness and lifted the heaviness of the Sambal Chili.
Finally found one that might have outclassed the Serangoon Garden Kway Chap! Love the broth and and tangy chili. Everything was done right(: Bit pricey though. #weekend #lunch #kwaychap #paleo #pork #streetfood #eggs
Which side are you on? I\'m on the dark side. Thinking of my weekend\'s breakfast :) 
$3, added pig liver so total was $4. Cheap and good!
took this on behalf of my friend. Oyster Omelette, $8. $8 for a $4-5 portion! siao bo! i didnt know about the taste cos i was sick and didnt eat that. oops.
I think I just wanna find another one that\'s as good/trumps the one at Serangoon Gardens:P
Fan favorite! Rewarding for those willing to brave the long queue to savour the wok fried goodness of this hawker classic.
Not as good as the many accolades at the stall front suggests :/
Stall 01-12 Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow. Always a joy to eat this here. Cheap &amp; Sinful.
Although i liked the wanton mee i had in Johor, i still very much prefer my Singaporean wanton mee :)
Hae Cho (Hokkien Style Fried Prawn &amp; Pork Rolls) &amp;\n<br />Fried Intestines. #hawkerfood #sgfood #yummy
So satisfying and lip-smackingly good! Loooove the Western Mixed Grills and the secret really lied in the sauce &amp; the well-charred skin of the chops &amp; steak.
Pretty decent and dammm sinful with those oil!
Fulfilling dinner for 3. Chicken chop, carrot cake, BBQ stingray, BBQ chicken wings, fish soup, gong gong, cockles and cuttlefish with Kang kong. Lastly, ice blended soursop! #dinner #food #burpple #friends
Good variety of Hor Fun and Mui Fun. Beef, fish, prawn or mix mix. Prepared with love. #01-163 . Opened Daily from 10:30am-8:30pm. Closed on Mondays.
Feeling abit sian of the food nearby, i decided to head down to old airport road which is freaky near to eat my lunch. Ate lor mee( super shiok) and chee chong fun with prawn!
Xin mei xiang zheng zong lor mee~ this got to be one of the best lor mee i have ever eaten. Love its gravy sauce! Egg wise i still prefer my mom one cuz my mom cooks the nicest braised egg/meat/duck :)
Hua kee wanton mee this time round! Noodle and charsiew is much nicer than cho kee! Wanton is normal.
Blanco Court Kway Chap! 😋 Please prepared to wait and queue if you really wanna try this! It\'s definitely worth the wait!!!
Nam Xing Legendary Hokkien Fried Mee! 🍤 Still regarded as one of the best Hokkien Mee in Singapore! Always a must-eat when I\'m here! 😋
I normally eat Lao Fu Zi 老夫子 Char Kway Teow at the Old Airport Road Market! But today I go for this less well known stall \"Dong Ji Fried Kway Teow\" to see if there\'s any different from the usual CKT!
Hougang Jing Jia Mutton Soup! 🐑🐏 I don\'t often eat mutton soup, especially with the pungent raw mutton taste! But this stall churn out a light herbal taste, which is not overwhelming. Overall it is still one of the better Chinese mutton soup around, compared to the ones at Amoy street market!
Hawker fare for lunch again!
Real cause for dinosaur\'s extinction. There wasn\'t any more #laoban
Wanton Mee from Old Airport Road hawker centre! I was contemplating about which noodle stall to order from. Either from Hua Kee or Cho Kee, which are both well-known with many newspaper cuttings, posters and food critics! In the end, I chose Cho Kee stall, the one with the electronic queue display (feels like buying Koi/Gongcha). 😂 Noodle was okay, chewy yet firm! Char siew were sliced with a good proportion of meat and fats! But the wanton and chili were ordinary, nothing special! 😳
Part of my hawker fare at lunch! Lor Mee at Old Airport Road, not from the popular Xin Mei Xiang 新美香卤面 stall, but still manage to satisfy my Lor Mee craving! 😋
3-in-1 Sweet potato, taro and nian gao from Geylang Lor 20 Fried Fritters stall at Old Airport Market and Food Centre! 😋
Hawker Food Fare for Friday #lunch
The best hokkien mee i\'ve had to date. The noodles are fried till fragrant (full of \'wok hei\') and soaked with the delicious broth. The chilli is gives the whole dish a kick to the next level of shiok!!!
Breakfast with Momma // Mee Pok from Ru Ji Kitchen. They served up their noodles for Singapore Day in New York! ✌
Goreng Pisang (Fried Bananas) 🍌 and 3-in-1 Fried Niao Gao, Yam and Sweet Potato 🍠 My Fave 😋
老夫子炒果条 Old Master Q 🙇 Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow is also included in my lunch today 😋
白兰阁果汁 Blanco Court Kway Chap lunch served with pig intestines, lean meat, beancurd, and braised eggs. 🐷 One of the timeless heritage of Singapore local delights!!!
lao ban soya beancurd...AH-MAZING! if you love tau foo fah, you will absolutely love this! @leongy &amp; @msphng
Satay fresh off the grill! My favorite meat here is the least popular chicken! Mutton, chicken or pork for you?
Savory, salty, eggy orh jian on a plate. I think my favorites are from Whampoa and Lagoon!
Teasers - fried oyster egg. Tasty! Wish it was a little crispier though! Stall #01-07
Filled to the brim... almost overflowing. The simple joy of eating it bit by bit and sucking the essence frim the bones. Hmmm... so nice!\n<br />◾◽\n<br />A very popular stall with long queue during peak hours.
Smooth, silky, yummy. Warm porridge on a rainy day just hits the spot! Simplicity in every spoonful, this porridge is a no-frills dinner on a rainy evening. Got the sliced fish century egg congee ($3), and the couple is pretty generous with the ingredients! Crack a raw egg for 50c, to add to the already silky texture of the porridge, and drizzle with sesame oil for a slight fragrance. 😋🍲\n<br />_______________\n<br />欣美粥品\n<br />Old Airport Hawker Centre\n<br />Block 51 Old Airport Road, #01-91\n<br />Singapore 390051\n<br />.\n<br /> #eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #exploreflavours #dojoeats
Apparently there are too much famous food at old airport road food centre. And at least 2 prawn noodles stores. Next time shall try another one. #burpple #8dayseat #food #foodporn #foodpost #foodie #sgfoodie #sgfood #noodles #asianfood
So we had #laofuzifriedkwayteow , #ginsensg thai noodle (which wasnt to my liking. The sauce was weirdly sweet, there was sugar!), fake laozhongzhong ngor hiang, fried bananas and soursop drink. #burpple #burpplesg
.\n<br />The signature wanton mee had the addition of sambal chili for that extra kick. Be sure to toss the noodles evenly to soak up all the that sauce, a great mixture of sweet and savoury, and complemented the chilli really well.\n<br />.\n<br />This dish definitely contains a smoky essence upon the first whiff, one of the unique flavours here. We love this bowl as it was one of the few with a layer of gravy to allow the noodles to be filled with sufficient moisture, compared to those with really thin layer of sauce or the completely dry ones. The egg noodles were a pleasure to munch on without a lingering alkaline taste.\n<br />.\n<br />The ingredients were a hit too - char siew meat was well roasted and had a good amount of sweetness. The wanton dumplings were soft in texture and packed with a good amount of pork. Grab one and send it between your tongue and palate, press it lightly and feel the savoury softness melt immediately\n<br />.\n<br />Accompanying soup was a refreshing end to the meal, great to cleanse down the grease and spiciness.\n<br />_______________\n<br />Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wan Ton Mee\n<br />Old Airport Road Food Centre\n<br />51 Old Airport Road \n<br />#01-02 \n<br />Singapore 390051\n<br />.\n<br />#eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #dojoeats

i am also about the wide diversity of cuisines we have available in Singapore. i am also a lot about hawkerfare like these Satay, Sambal Stingray, Orh Luak and BBQ Wings, and i guarantee you, this Oyster Omelette located at Old Airport Road Food Centre is definitely one of the best in SG and so worth the wait (such damn fresh and plump oysters!) 😆 \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple @hungrygowhere #hungrygowhere #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporefood #singaporeeats #hawkerfood #hawkerfare #eatlocal #jiaklocal @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #oldairportroadfoodcentre #satay #sambalstingray #orhluak #oysteromelette #bbqchickenwings
The live prawns are kept in a tank, right in front of the stall, absolutely fresh! I forgot the unit number but this stall is located at Old Airport Road Food Centre and Market, the same row as the Hock Lam Beef stall, nearer to the centre. \n<br />#6 on the menu board; $6. \n<br />Order the fresh prawns (鲜虾) instead of big prawns (大虾) as the big/jumbo prawns are not live prawns.
No health authority would ever recommend this though. 😂
Like this one. Ok, that\'s all.
My standard food items to buy back home whenever I\'m at old airport! Cheap and good! #burpple #burpplesg #burpplesghawkerfare #laoban
So early morning traipsing to a hawker centre not too far away.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />I am amazed by the speed this char kway teow was prepared. Within 5 mins, it was so ready. It was oily, slippery, glistening and with generous amount of beansprouts, one get that luscious crunch to pair off with the soft noodle texture.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Simply sinful! \n<br />#charkwayteow #noodleholic #burpple #igers #hungrygowhere #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #photographers #photooftheday #instafoodsg #singaporefood #sinful #tripadvisor #jiaklocal #oldschool #laofuzifriedkwayteow #exploresingapore

walked pass this stall which what suppose to be Foons Thai recipe is now known as Thai Street Noodle. It indeed delivered! It reminded me of Foons Thai recipe when it just open. The noodles at $5 was plentiful and came with plentiful of ingredients. The noodles are al dente style and each strand is infused with its Thai sweet sauce.

in the short span of 15 minutes while waiting for the Chef Uncle to whip up two plates of this Oyster Omelette, the lady queuing behind me practically told me her life story. i even know the names of her kids, their ages and that she\'s a happy, single Mom! we were like old friends who bumped into each other by chance. i\'m glad she was there to accompany me cos this Uncle really took his time 😂 and anyway, this Orh Luak is sooooooo good. lots of eggs, big oysters and you barely taste any starch!

The almond and sesame paste...Such a nice dessert for a gloomy and rainy Friday. \n<br />I really like these 2 Colours - Black and White. Their pure form gives a striking contrast to one another\'s presence. One as a reflector of light and one as an absorber of light. \n<br />Haha... Just eat lah.

Parboiled and thick sweet gooey sauce splashed all over ... smothering each component. The chewy cuttlefish, the soft kangkong, the slight crisp taupok and the beansprouts with a delicate crunch. Finishing touch of crushed peanuts generously splattered as the crowning glory. Toss or mess it up, each element complements each weakness and strength.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />So simplicity is not boring, simplicity actually invigorates and excites the tastebuds.

This Satay has got to be the  most consistent one of them all. Remember many years ago, when I first tried and fast forward to now? it still has the exact same taste! Fatman Satay uses mince meat to bind them together to get its trademark texture and their gravy is super smooth and tasty!

As the wok is really heated, it will char the Kway Teow and cause the wok hei flavour to be really intense. 👍🏻\n<br />•\n<br />You get to choose many flavours, including seafood, fish, beef and for me I choose prawns. The Hor Fun was not over saucey, so the proportion of the dry and wet of the Hor fun is just 👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />At around ($4) per plate, you get to feel satisfied, warm and craving to go back for more! 🤗\n<br />•\n<br />Have a great night ahead everyone!

It comes with lots of ingredients, such as cuttlefish, pork liver,slices of meat and youtiao, though the latter tasted quite stale.

What a hearty affair with my girls 😍😍😍
Curiosity had me venturing to Old Airport Road Food Centre (my first visit in the year since we moved to our current apartment only two bus stops away 😂) in search of it. I finally found the auntie, who was smiley and not at all fazed when I asked to buy five loaves - people from Australia buy it in bulk to freeze, she tells me. As for the bread, it\'s like the girls described - pillowy, soft and with a distinct milk fragrance. I probably would like it more if it reminded me of my childhood, and if I wasn\'t gluten intolerant. Haha. Find this at Mei Jia stall, unit 01-43. #burpple #burpplesg #oldschool #bakery #milkbread #childhood #childhoodfood #bread #notglutenfree #singaporefood #foodhunt
My answer: if i do so, many people will start Crying.
Easy to identify from its consistent long Q. Waited for about 30mins but it was worth it. \n<br />Liked the generous portion of minced fish meat which was in every mouthful after mixing into the noodles. Gravy was flavourful and consistent without being overly starchy. Definitely a winner amongst the Loh Mee stalls here. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #lohmee #burpproved
Both stall commanded a queue although the former\'s was significantly longer. \n<br />Both at $5, 1 served minced fish meat while the other fish chunks, with complimentary fish head meat. Though Tiong Bahru\'s had the familiar ngor hiong, the flavour of XMX\'s was definitely richer and its gravy had better consistency. So while both were tasty, we agreed that XMX\'s was our pick for Loh Mee here in future. \n<br />Where are your recommendations for good Loh Mee in SG? #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #lohmee #burpproved

This dish was really delicious, especially when it is mixed with its homemade sambal chill. I literally can\'t stop eating the rice 😱😱😱.

The sliced fish hor fun from Hua Ji XO fish head bee hoon, stall #01-118. Although would love to try the bee hoon, I decided to go for a low calorie sliced fish instead. I would say that the sauce was really awesome and the sliced fish was fresh. This meal costs me $4.50, and its value for money. In addition, the uncle that cooks in this stall happens to be the cook that used to work for the adjacent zhi char store (Xi Xiang Feng) small world indeed. Btw the sambal chilli (not shown is really 😋😭)\n<br />#jiakpahliao #Puikiajiak #healthieralternative #slicedfishhorfun #horfun #slicedfish #fishmeal #huajixofishheadbeehoon #huaji #foodporn #foodstagram #foodstagrammer #ahpuikiajiak #burpple #wati8today
◽\n<br />Ming Guan only sells seafood beehoon... choice of sliced fish, lala, prawns, crayfish or all of the above in one plate. Mine is a $10 plate of sliced fish and lala..enough for 2 pax.\n<br />◽\n<br />Was not expecting much since the more popular white beehoon are at Sembawang or Toa Payoh. When I took the first spoonful, the wokhei-ness screamed on my palate. Seafood was fresh and the generous portion of gravy was a tinge smoky, rich and umami. There is also \"help yourself\" to crispy pork lard for that added umaminess.\n<br />◽\n<br />I do not have to travel far to satisfy my white beehoon craving cos it is close to my backyard #jiaklocal\n<br />This surprising find is located right at the last lane nearest to the big carpark.\n<br />Name : Ming Guan Seafood Beehoon\n<br />Addr : #01-51 Old Airport Road Hawker Centre

Not bad for my liking, I love their chilli! -J
This dish left me grinning with satisfaction! The Char Siew was not overly charred and had a crisp outer layer. What was so remarkable was how the meat looked deceptively lean yet tasted so juicily fatty 👍🏼😍!\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />.\n<br />@RoastParadise has been around for almost a year and they already have a steady fan base! They are only open from 11am-2pm and 4.30pm to 6pm and are closed on Mondays and only open halfday on Wed and Sun! The owners are 2 young chaps who decided to get out of the rat race and preserve our hawker culture. Their passion is unmistakably evident from the quality roast meats they serve!\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #sgfood #sgfoodie #instafood #foodphotography #sgfoodlover #fooddiary #foodstagram #foodieat #sgfoodlover #foodporn #foodie #foodlover #sghawker #roastparadise #tastytastemakertour #burpplesg #roast #pork

The char siew are not bad and the wantons are filling.
I really like the way the Yong tofu is being made. It\'s fish paste fillings are so fresh and chewy, you know that what you eat is good stuff indeed. 2nd day of long weekend. :)\n<br />#yongtofu #beancurd #hawkerfood #oldairportroad #oldairportroadfoodcentre #healthychoices #healthyeating #burrple
The Uncle and Auntie from 香积秒厨 has been mending this stall for years at the market area of the old airport road. The vegetarian items on their standard bee Hoon are so yummy and doesn\'t really have the over floury or starchy feel. Furthermore it costs just $2.00-2.50! Oh happy day!\n<br />#vegetarian #vegetarianfood #vegetarianfoodshare #vegetarians #beehoon #econmicfood #oldairportroad #oldairportroadmarket #foodhunt #foodiegram #foodstagram #puikiajiak #ahboyjiakbabuay #jiakbahliao #burpple
Traditional Singapore Chicken Rice and Fried Pig\'s Intestine (Chitterlings) which is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  I\'ve learned that it\'s braised till very tender then coated with a special breading then deep fried in seasoned oil till crisp which is one the best ones I\'ve tasted.  No wonder my visiting foodie friend insisted to visit, coz it\'s quite good.  I also got some Roasted and White Chicken Rice, which is moist, tasty, savory and very tender. \n<br />Old Airport Road Hawker Centre, Singapore
Although I am not an egg tart lover, these tarts looks so irresistible. Tried one and decided to buy a few back for mum as tea break snack.\n<br />#eggtart #pasteries #charcoal #snacks #localdelight #localfood #foodporn #teabreak #foodstagram #burpple
The stall originates from Holland Drive and was even featured in overseas food festival. What I like about the noodles are:\n<br />1. The sambal has a rich shrimp paste aroma\n<br />2. Chewy fish balls\n<br />3. Tasty fish cake\n<br />This ain\'t your typical kopitiam fish ball noodles for sure. 👍😋\n<br />#rujikitchenfishballnoodles #rujikitchen #fishball #fishballnoodles #fishcake #foodporn #jiakbahliao #puikiajiak #ahboyjiakbabuay #foodiegram #foodstagram #hawkerfood #oldairportfoodcentre #oldairportroadfoodcenter #oldairportroad #eatsg #localfood #localdelight #breakfast  #burpple

missing the you tiao ones but doubt I can ever find that here at home.
to me, it\'s the big fat fresh prawns and the flavorful sweet prawn soup.
Freshly made Chee Cheong Fun that took me about 20 mins to queue up for. This is another Old airport road weekend highlights where people would just queue up to wait for this traditional local dish. Heard from the Tow Kay Neo, it has been a long running family business for at least 15 years.\n<br />On this plate, I had century eggs, char Siew and prawns Cheong fun. This stall also sells other breakfast items like congees and noodle soup. All these awesome breakfast at affordable prices ranging from $2.00 to $4.00\n<br />#cheecheongfun #oldairportroadfoodcentrecheecheongfun #oldairportroad #oldairportroadfoodcentre #hawkerfood #breakfast #breakkie #vsco #vscocam #eatsg #eatalone #eatlocal #foodporn #foodie #foodhunt #centuryeggs #charsiew #prawns #zhuchangfen 
The Hua Kee wanton mee. Awesome chewy noodles with tasty wanton (pork dumplings) and char Siew (roasted pork). The special chilli sauce blends extremely well with the noodles. This stall has been doing this biz for years together with his family... The uncle is well known for his impatience and rather nasty temper. I guess that\'s one of the key traits of being a good hawker. Price range: 4,5,6 bucks... The increase of every dollar is probably the addition of noodles, 2 wantons and some char Siew bits. \n<br />#jiakaki #eatalone #oldairportroadfoodcentre #oldairportroad #wanton #wantonnoodles #dumplings #hawkerfood #foodie #foodhunt #foodiegram #foodporn #eatsg

Smooth and still a soft bite and seasoned just thereabouts. The addition of char Siew somewhat novel to add a touch of caramelised sweetness and gives this mee pok a unique take :)\n<br />#meepok #charsiew #noodles #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #roastparadise

This #LorMee from #OldAirportRoad #Foodcentre is da bomb! I finally had the chance of eating it (without queuing-ahem) because a friend stood in the queue. I don\'t need to tell you which store is it because at any one time there\'s at least 15-20pax in the queue! Go early if you\'re looking for #lunch before 12noon or suffer having a long queue! \n<br />Have a great weekend folks! \n<br />#foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia

You can find a very wide variety of fillings. There\'s century eggs, prawns, chicken, char siew, otah and many more.. #cheecheongfun #ricerolls #oldairport #hawkerfood #hawker #hawkerpedia
I didn\'t quite like the fried oyster by them cause it\'s was like soaking wet in oil. Today I passed by this shop, my foodie friend told me this one cooked by this uncle which I have not seen his face is good. So give it a try. It\'s really not bad! #friedoysters #hawker #hawkerfood #hawkerpedia #oldairport #oldairportroad

This has got to be one of my favorite hawker food and the stall at old airport road hawker centre does it really well. The Popiah has some deliciously stewed white radish filling, with a crunchy kick from some fried garnish (could not make up what it was). The stall touts its handmade Popiah skin that was thin and tasty along with the sweet sauce. #hawkerpedia
This is homely, surely ! #sg50 😋✨🇮🇩
So well flavoured !😋✨🇮🇩

I totally agree with that as it has led me to find many like-minded friends whom we can talk for hours over food. And the best part, we can share the calories by ordering from several stalls and take our time to layout and photograph it without bothering about the weird stares of others.

I had this flavorful #chicken #NasiBriyani at the #OldAirportRoad for only $3! So cheap and good! Must try if you like #malayfood \n<br />#yummy #foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia
From Toa Payoh Rojak. Bought the $3 portion cos it looked like no one was queuing but I was wrong. It was a queue number system. The rojak sauce was nice, on the sweet side though the prawn paste ? taste wasn\'t strong. Glad the fruits weren\'t sour, and tasted quite fresh with a good crunch in addition to the peanuts and fried youtiao.
Freshly made rolls, love the smooth texture. $2/roll
This Chinese fried fritters only serves in the day time! So if you have craving for this, here it is! Not that bad....great taste and good sauce to dip in! 
☺️✨😅
The dessert is smooth and lovely treat for afternoon tea....

Close up of the $8 big prawn noodles (soup)! 
Queued so long for this Rojak! Supposedly reputed to be one of the best in Singapore, but we found its taste only so-so, as it was lacking the oomph of a distinct prawn paste taste. Wouldn\'t sacrifice another 30mins for this again! 
Ample portion with a huge crispy fried chicken drumstick. No wonder it gets sold out by lunch time. 😋👍#food #sgfood #sgfoodie #foodie #foodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodpic #foodpics #instasg #instafood #instagood #instalike #instadaily #photooftheday #picoftheday #igers #sgig #igsg #igdaily #singapore #springtomorrow #eat #hungry #delicious #yum #yummy #cheapeatsinsingapore #nomnomnom
