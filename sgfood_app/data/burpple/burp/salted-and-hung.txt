This was a crowd pleaser amongst the adults. Grilled just right before it becomes chewy, the octopus was tender, flavourful and the corn was the perfect accomplice!
The weekend brunch even has a charcuterie and antipasti bar. Loved it!
You would love this. Egg, chorizo, tomato jam and potato foam. This was another small plate which was a hit with the gang. It just spells breakfast and in a comforting kind of way.
We knew we struck gold when the youngest diner at our brunch party says he wants more of this and fights the adults for it. So good that we had to order more.
My Sunday started off on a perfect note with this smoked halibut and caviar crostini.
Nudge those slices of Wagyu bresaola aside for some confit #eggporn. They\'re great partners-in-crime for that fat and juicy portobello mushroom.\n<br />Loved this \"small plate\" so much I may have eaten more than my fair share of it. Oops.\n
Expertly grilled, the thick cut of pork collar was at a sublime level of tenderness. As I brought each piece to my mouth, it literally dripped with juices, which made my mouth water even more. Chef @drewnocente dressed it with shards of nuts and julienned green apple - a most delicious match.
Chef Drew does beef tongue oh-so-right you\'ll want to lap up every bit of it. He grills it to tender perfection and plates it with parsley oil and celeriac for accompaniment.
It started with a nibble and ended with me scraping up every bit when I thought nobody was watching. That\'s how good Chef @drewnocente\'s charcuterie board was.\n<br />I had a weakness for the \"Country Terrine\" in particular. Spicy, multi-textural, rich and gunky, most of that orange mound was polished off by myself.
With oxtail topped up beef fats. I like that there\'re enough toppings here relative to the marrow, and in its case, beef fats that are fried till crispy. This is like adding more sin on top of sin, but I love it :)
They could make something as simple as a corn taste this good. Sweet corn were tossed in light creamy manchego cheese and a little bit of chives, then given an umami boost from bonito. And with that little burnt smell on the corn, simple things done perfectly. Try it!
The gentle smokiness complimented the sweetness of the fish very nicely. Atop a piece of toasted sourdough, and little bursts of the ocean from the caviar, this is comfort food at a very high level. #saltedandhung #burpple
I don\'t know why we didn\'t order this before but after hearing @happygreedyfoodie rave about it, we ordered two birds to share amongst us (in addition to our individual mains). Succulent and moist inside, crispy on the skin, we had everyone fighting for the last piece. So good!
Great starter on last week\'s lunch menu at @saltedandhung. Always a treat to dine here as the food always rocks!
I assure you this dish is nothing as underwhelming as its name. It is a tender, charred and smokey house cured bacon chop, that is not overly salty like your supermarket variants. Pairs really well with the sweet, caramelized pineapple. So good, we had 2 serves of it even though we were so full. #burpple #saltedandhung
It\'s so good that I ordered a second serving at the end of my meal.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />So many things done right here - First, the squid was perfectly grilled by their josper grill, so there was a thin layer of charcoal smokiness on the exterior, yet the squid remains really tender. Second, the two sauces were made each other, as they balanced each other in terms of both flavour and texture. The darker, richer, very umami squid ink miso was perfect match for the lighter, citrus yuzu dressing.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Now, mix them up in your desired ratio and have it with the charcoal grilled tender squid.. Just close your eyes and let time stand still!
Incredibly flaky barramundi with a great texture. There\'s something about the barramundi that tastes really meaty and satisfying, though the skin could have been more crispy. While the sweet and sour sauce was good, there wasn\'t really enough to complement the fish
Pineapple was decent only but the coconut sorbet was very refreshing. Cold, smooth and creamy, it was good on its own but didn\'t really go with the pineapple. Pistachio was inconspicuous but the crisp was pretty nice, whatever it was
A mystery how McDonald\'s is not out of business when this burger exists, and at this price point. The brioche bun was toasted until some parts were crispy and flaky, all while enclosing the superbly smoky and tangy BBQ sauce and soft meat. We licked our plates clean
The sangas here are a steal. Perfectly toasted bread with a burst of umami in every bite and appreciable meatiness. The mayo was pretty good too.
Absolutely delicious grilled squid with squid ink dip at the side. Tender, umami filled and value for money.
Don\'t miss their cured meats when you\'re here. There\'s a reason why they\'re called \"salted and hung\", which is literally what they do when they cure their meats.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />This dish surprised all of us when it was served because of the generous amount of black truffles on it. And these truffles were thick, so they maintained their shape till the end of the meal. Thick enough for me to taste the nuttiness in these truffles, when when you eat it with the thick confit egg yolk mixed into the coppa. So much flavour and fragrance in one mouth, with a good intensity of the coppa that\'s not too salty.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I wouldn\'t have known of this gem if Chef @drewnocente hadn\'t sent this plate over as a gesture of friendship when I dined with @nantheless. Such a wonderful dinner that kept me happy throughout the evening. I\'ll review other dishes here too.
Gooseberry semifredo, lychee foam and almond crisps. Light and refreshing, there was total silence on our table as everyone tucked in with contentment on their face. Thanks, Chef @drewnocente for this sweet treat!
You\'ve got to try this. Amazing pasta, of course, I should have expected this as Chef Drew has Italian blood in him. The texture was so good, al dente, the way I like it. This pasta was cut in circles,  which allows you to scoop a spoonful of the hearty Wagyu Ragu, beef fat (yes, those crispy bits) and pumpkin pur√©e into each of them to make that perfect bite. Love, love, love this.
Chef @drewnocente, thanks so much for sending us this! We all enjoyed it!
Ordered a portion to share and so glad that everyone enjoyed it as much as I do.  This is an all time favourite for me.
I had the smoked eel pate which was one of the starters on their weekly lunch menu. This was so excellent! Crazy creamy and buttery, it was so good with their crusty sourdough. Truly enjoyed this.
Why? Because they easily rival the meats and seafood here in terms of fullness of flavour and deliciousness. \n<br />The Corn ($10++) has sweet kernels swirled in a chives-speckled light creaminess from manchego cheese. Fluttery bonito flakes complete the equation with a touch of the sea-voury. \n<br />The Brussels Sprouts ($12++) sees the crunchy vegetable grilled, then tossed with guanciale (an Italian cured pork) and a miso ricotta. I find this combination really quite spectacular. So even if you\'ve always avoided brussels sprouts like the plague, I say: Give this a go. It might change your mind about the much-maligned vegetable.
Just like \"The Barden Bellas\" gunning for a capella victory in \"Pitch Perfect\", every element on this plate harmonised like a champion.\n<br />The al dente discs of pasta, tender Wagyu beef ragu, smooth pumpkin mash and crunchy beef fat crumbs sure made some beautiful music together. \n<br />This winner of a main dish was part of my 2-course set lunch.
Fell in lust today. The object of my desire? This incredible bone marrow dish by Chef Drew.\n<br />It had me squirming in my seat, all hot under my collar and gasping in pleasure (softly, I might add, as I was at a table with four others).\n<br />Everything about it was created to drive a person wild. The triple threat of seduction came in the form of melt-in-the-mouth marrow, tender-beyond-belief braised oxtail and a golden shower of crunchy crumbs of beef fat (yes, beef fat).\n<br />Who in the right mind can resist this I ask you?
Ok doesn‚Äôt make sense for me not to write about a meat dish so yes the Iberico Pork Collar - juicy and smoky pieces layered with apple slices and isomalt shards made with sesame and mixed nuts (we witnessed the impressive process of making it!) which give a sweet crisp profile to the dish.
I‚Äôve always wondered why the name ‚ÄúSalted and Hung‚Äù, and then I saw the chunks of meat hanging in the cabinet... in-house curing!\n<br />:\n<br />One of the signature starters/snacks is the Lardo ($15), white strips of cured pork fat drizzled with truffle honey and sprinkled chilli flakes. The smooth slices of lard were pleasantly light on the palate, and I really liked the sweetness from the honey melding with the fat that kickstarts the appetite - never knew I can enjoy lard so much without it being roasted or fried! These were served with cumin seed crackers for some crunch.
This has peanut butter ganache, peanut felleutine, and milk chocolate ice cream, appealing very much to the child in you. Thankfully the chef has added spikes of sour bergamot gel to balance the heavy nutty dessert.
The pavlova is one that I hope to enjoy again, slightly burnt meringue cracked open with shiso granita (like a coarser sorbet) inside and vanilla ice cream, strewn with blood orange cream crumble. This is one explosive dessert that‚Äôs sweet, citrusy, and playful on textures.
Cauliflower has never tasted better to me, aburi-ed then dressed with cider vinegar cream and finished with shavings of cured egg yolk. The tangy vinegar cream excites the tastebuds while the vegetable itself was well-seasoned - is that the effect from the cured yolk?? If only cauliflower can be all cooked like this!
This is another must-try here. It‚Äôs crispy, but because of the natural collapsible honeycomb structure, it\'s spongey as well - very interesting texture!
Tiny parcels packed full of goodness!!! My therapist told me that I need to stay off night shades as well as nuts because it\'s causing my insides to be inflamed but I just can\'t help myself sometimes :p #facepalm #sorrynotsorry. 
The Arctic Char was listed as a special on the board when I was there with friends for dinner last Saturday. Not to be confused with salmon, this also comes from the cold-water fish family, but has a comparatively cleaner and milder taste.\n<br />Chef @drewnocente put his distinctive spin on it by first curing the naturally fatty fish in citrus and salt. He then plated it, very prettily I might add, with a refreshing yuzu-based dressing, dill, pickled onions and caviar. I love how his combination had the fish dancing on our tastebuds.
Beautifully plated by Chef Drew and his Supergirl Chef Team, this plate of waygu breasola with egg yolk confit on portobello mushroom brought the A game from first glance to the last salty, juicy, creamy bite
Silky ribbons of melt in your mouth lard, drizzled with truffle honey... Oh yes, icing on the cake!
For those who love their meats, this modern Australian spot on Purvis Street is perfect for a casual business lunch. The set lunch menu ($25 for two courses and $35 for three) is a great introduction to the magic these guys can do with meats. The starter of raw beef is kept simple, yet elevated with the interesting sprinkle of umami-rich prawn powder. Alternatively, start with the humble cauliflower that sits on cider vinegar cream and finished with a shavings of cured egg yolk. Burppler Amelia PW is all praise for the mains, with options that include a moist barramundi with bonito, beans and kelp, and a stellar Westholme wagyu flank (additional $10), which she declares was juicy, perfectly cooked and the star of her meal. \n<br />Avg price: $30 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Dixon Chan\n<br />Reservations available via Burpple
The cold coconut sorbet sitting on a warm, thick slab of pineapple was an absolute delight. I loved the sorbet but felt that the pineapple was a little too tough and sweet. I only wished it retained some of its natural acidity, to bring the meal to a refreshing end. Pistachio brittle was good too, but didn\'t do much for the dish.
While their starters were pretty average, their mains definitely made an impression.
For my main course. I enjoyed the firm yet loose texture of the meat, while you bring up the unavoidable comparison with the Barramundi at Cheek by Jowl. Leaves me thinking a lot about that experience.
My favorite starter was the Cauliflower. Packed full of flavor with the cider vinegar cream and cured egg yolk. Simple yet so good.
I\'ve got this as a starter to my 2-course set lunch. As straightforward the name goes, this is raw beef. The sprinkled prawn powder gave a nice umami touch to the rawness. Not bad at all! Pro-tip: make a reservation on Burpple before you head down. 
Absolutely incredible food. Almost everything was finely balanced in taste and texture. We had such a lovely evening there with Drew Nocente at the helm. More photos: http://bit.ly/2kNWxHq
Defo not cheap, but worth the splurge for the quality you‚Äôre getting! üëåüèº Every bite of this incredibly juicy and mouth-watering steak will make you deliriously happy, I kid you not. üëÖüí¶ So good, we really did not want this to end. \n<br />Interesting addition of the sweet sesame brittle to complement the overall savoury profile too.
Here‚Äôs another exceptional dish we couldn‚Äôt get enough of: ribbons of perfectly cooked beef tongue dotted with wasabi emulsion and pickled onions.
I love mackerel and the superb gin-cured riff here was so good (esp with a dab of that horseradish cream!), I could have easily wiped the whole plate off without coming up for air. ü§£ Next time, I‚Äôm not sharing this with anyone! 
This party in the mouth is comprised of melt-in-the-mouth, jelly-like pig trotter bits in a savoury and slightly tangy sauce atop a crisp toast finished with zippy pickle discs to cut through all that richness.
Super moreish starter to munch on and share! Personally not a big fan of Szechuan pepper but this was sprinkled with just enough to tease your taste buds with the mildest numbing sensation. #BurppleXChope
Definitely our favorite here. üòò And the pretty @deejo_knives that I can\'t wait to get my hands on! To go with my marble @luzerneglobal plates gifted by my boy. #cutlerycollector #platelover
Couldn\'t decide what we wanted on the charcuterie board (all made in house!) so we went ahead w Chef\'s Selection ($28). My fav was the lardo; perfectly cured fat, drizzled with truffle honey and chilli. Creamy, silky, sweet, melt in your mouth fat flavour that makes you forget you\'re eating slices of pure fat. Diet can wait. 
Throwback to the adventure we had at S&amp;H trying out the tasty Beef Tongue ($16) slices w pickled onions, fragrant fried shallots and wasabi mayo; soft, chewy and strong beefy flavour üëåüèª
Fallen angel and peanut butter Tim tams. Yes beer and dessert pairs well.
Chocolate, salted caramel, chocolate pearls and...peanut butter. #foodporn #saltedandhung #burpple
Fried Chicken &amp; Pancakes and Smoked Toriyama Wagyu Neck Burger. The fried chicken and pancake doesn‚Äôt sound very appetizing but it was a combo made in heaven. The moist and fluffiness of the pancake compliments the fried chicken perfectly.
This is usually the type of dish I would shy away from, but I\'m glad I got to try this. Prepared so that the tripe is super crisp, it\'s flavoured with tongarashi and Szechuan spices including a very slight hint of peppercorn that can give the tongue a very faint numbing sensation.\n<br />This makes a really addictive snack to go along with a few round of drinks.\n<br />#SaltedAndHung #WellHung #UnlistedCollection
Amazing cured, grilled and seared meats, paired with the most refreshing and interesting ingredients. Highly recommend the crab and uni, octopus and berries dessert. Great dinner and will def return. 
It\'s just opposite Clinton St Baking Company.\n<br />The quote on the wall is based on a novel called Animal Farm by George Orwell reflecting Russia\'s revolution and Stalinist Era. Pretty interesting book, do check it out!\n<br />#SaltedandHung \n<br />Every week, their chef will feature a dish on the menu like the Matcha Cake which is the feature of the week !  Matcha Cake with white chocolate blueberry cream and yogurt üç¶ with a hint of yuzu and topped with blueberries! \n<br />We love plated desserts!\n<br />Also get your hands on some rare Kangaroo meat !
üá¶üá∫\n<br />Love it when the treats at the end of a good meal make the whole experience even more delightful and memorable. These Anzac biscuits certainly hit the spot and brought back memories of home. I\'m sure every Aussie kid has had plenty of Anzac bics and even tried to bake them‚Äîthese gems presented in a secretive wooden box at the end of our meal were certainly a level up from the classic Anzac biscuit with bacon bits amongst the oats and a nice dollop of salted caramel atop each nugget. I could scoff down a whole jar of these by myself!\n<br />Thanks @lkkben + @veronicaphua for the invite and @saltedandhung for filling my tummy with damn good food!\n<br />#SaltedAndHung #AnzacBiscuits
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />This slab of Blackmore 9+ Wagyu Flank was made more \"Waaaaaaaah!\" by the presence of sweetbread and a terrific pomegranate creme. It didn\'t hurt to have the lentils, quinoa and warrigal greens join them on the plate either.
Deeply enamoured by this we were.\n<br />Simply called \"Popcorn\", this creative dessert by Pastry Chef Wei Chan comprised of three textures each of corn and raspberries. The former was conjured into a smooth ice-cream, powder (the granules you see strewn across the plate) and tiny buttery blobs. The latter took on the guise of a better version of the fruit itself, crisp meringue planks and a ruby-red sweet sauce.\n<br />Choose this if you want a highly original, light and playful close to your meal.
Resembling marble gleaming in moonlight, the hefty slab of barramundi was served warm unlike the mackerel cured in gin brought to the table by Chef Drew a few minutes before. One look at this beauty and I knew it was going to be moist and tender. One bite later, I had the proof.\n<br />The fish wasn\'t the only thing worth the love on this plate though. Yes, it might have been the lead in this production but the assemble cast of juicy scallops (they\'re hidden under those leaves), crisped discs of chorizo and lightly chewy buckwheat risotto, more than held their own.
If you like beef tartare, this is something you shouldn\'t miss. Chopped into small cubes, the raw kangaroo meat has absolutely no smell or taste of gaminess. Chef Drew dresses it up prettily and tastily with pickled beetroot, juniper crumbs and the most divine blood orange creme (I could eat a whole tub of this!). All made in-house of course.\n<br />I highly recommend trying this even if you have never had beef tartare before because it is a dish that\'s hard to come by in Singapore and also, it\'s executed very well.
My favourite of the fish dishes was the Mackerel Cured in Gin. Not only was it beautifully moist but also tantalisingly smoky having been caressed by flames.
Not that the salmon was ill (hurhurhur) but it was cured so expertly it satisfied both my eyes and tastebuds. I know some people associate cured food with saltiness but trust me, this wasn\'t the case at all. The fish had a gentle flavour and a texture that\'s medium-firm. If you like sashimi, this is something you should try as it is very similar, with the added benefit of interestingly done accompaniments.\n
It\'s great to see a familiar dish at Salted &amp; Hung even as the restaurant has moved to its new location on Purvis Street. Salaciously seasoned and fantastically crunchy, the Salt &amp; Pepper Beef Tripe pair superbly with most tipples. Little wonder these deepfried delights are a firm favourite amongst their regulars and an instant infatuation with first-time customers. \n<br />Tip: Do eat the tripe while they\'re still hot because the crunchiness wears off once it starts to cool. 
\nThe cured meats at Salted &amp; Hung could be the cure for residual Monday blues, especially when washed down with your favourite vino. Everything you see spread on the board, arranged in the pot and filled in the jar are made in-house by Chef Drew and his team. And they are not limited to your usual suspects of salami and the likes. Be prepared to veer into adventurous territory with kangaroo loin, lardo (cured fat) and a rillette made with oxtail.\n<br />My personal favourite was the rillette for its creamy, pate-like texture and intense beef flavour. Shameless me dug straight into the jar to have it like ice-cream.
Tender pork collar that was still a teeny weeny pink inside and rested on a savoy cabbage puree. It was smooth and creamy.\n<br />Pork was accompanied by black rice (not as fluffy like white rice). Texture was like peanut smitherings, a tad crunchy with a nutty aftertaste. Da bomb in this little pile of black rice were bits of soft chewy pork fats that elevated the rice to another level. Simply satisfying:)
Super silky mash with squid ink and sea salt, what a luxury. This was one of my favorites from 5th Quarter, and I\'m so glad they\'ve kept it on the menu at Salted and Hung. Don\'t miss this! Overall, the dishes I loved from 5th Quarter were fantastic as ever (tripe, mash, all desserts), while the new ones didn\'t quite match them. I hope to come back again to see how they fare in the coming months though!
During the Open Street Party yesterday, we were super excited to be able to sample some of the dishes that will be rolling out in the menu. Do pop by if you are around the area and grab a wine/beer to go with some of the food items such as the Pancakes &amp; Chicken, Smoked Wagyu Neck Sanga and Bjorn-Inspired Nachos.\n<br />.\n<br />Salted and Hung\n<br />Address: 12, Purvis Street, Singapore 188591

Uni and lardo on a bed of pasta tossed in fermented prawn butter and topped with caviar. This was soooo yummy. Thank you @drewnocente for letting us sample this.\n<br />*\n<br />It was served with fresh pasta rather than angel hair as they had run out of the latter. I can only imagine how much better it would have tasted with angel hair!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Fragrant, moist and sinful! Something to die for
Loved the fact that the octopus still retained the heat after coming out of the kitchen and @estherangel loved the corn so much that she refused to let the plate be cleared until every single bead of corn were ravished by her

Perfect indulgent sandwich. Reminds me of the times when my mother used to make me grilled sandwiches with the sandwich maker with lots of butter. There\'s just something so deeply comforting about warm toasties. We certainly enjoyed them today.
When @veronicaphua dropped by to say Hi, she was raving about the country terrine she had. We were there for the weekend brunch but Chef @andromedanii kindly indulged us with a tasting portion. Thank you üòò.\n<br />*\n<br />I love Chef @drewnocente‚Äôs terrines and pates.

Sooo yummy üòãüòãüòã. These tasted even better than the yummy toasties they serve during lunch. Naturally I asked whether they were different - the answer was no, they were the same. The only difference was that these were served as single layer toasties while the regular lunch ones were served as doubles. Could that be the reason? Regardless, they were very tasty and addictive!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

This was one of my favourite starters amongst the many we tried. Smoked halibut and caviar crostini. *\n<br />I have to kick myself for not listening to Chef @drewnocente earlier when he said we should try the brunch.

*\n<br />Chocolate - with Mascarpone (Italian cream cheese) ice cream and amaretto (Italian liqueur) caramel on a bed of chocolate and espresso crumbs. This is my new favourite üòç. I now prefer it to my old favourite, the pavlova. It is so exciting when a new dish creates a wow which surpasses an old favourite!\n<br />*\n<br />The pear is another dessert which I like. This is one for those who prefer it less sweet and like the taste of ginger. The ginger flavour in the sauce was quite mild yet distinct enough. I loved it so much that I slurped up every bit of it.\n<br />*\n<br />The complimentary Anzac cookies are a perfect way to end the meal. These are the best ones I\'ve had. The savoury flavour of bacon and salted caramel was an amazing contrast to the sweetness of the oat cookies.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Served with hazelnut and kale emulsion, Okinawa spinach and carrot.\n<br />*\n<br />Hailed as the Kobe beef of pork, the Mangalica pig is a descendant of the European wild boar and cousin of the black foot Iberian pig. It is no wonder that the meat was so tender and juicy. It was melt-in-your-mouth awesome! The marbling was so amazing that one couldn\'t tell where the layer of fat ended and where the meat began.\n<br />*\n<br />As one would expect with meat served at @saltedandhung , the pork belly was chargrilled to perfection with a lovely smoky flavour.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This comes pretty close to what I would consider as the gold standard of mashed potatoes - Joel Robuchon\'s pur√©e de pomme.\n<br />*\n<br />The kids are the best judge of course and they polished off every bit of it!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

If you love oxtail and bone marrow, you will love this dish.\n<br />*\n<br />The best way to eat this (for me at least) is to spread the bone marrow onto the sourdough toast and top it with the oxtail reduction and beef fat crumbs. Very very sinful but so so yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
With nori (seaweed), cheese, pine nuts and burnt butter. While the cheese made the dish a little rich, the pine nuts and burnt butter gave it a nutty savoury flavour.\n<br />*\n<br />Another vegetable dish where Chef @drewnocente worked some magic and made it taste good. If you have trouble getting your kids to eat vegetables, this is the place to bring them to üòÇ. Even brussel sprouts and in this case, kale, taste yummy. My favourite is most definitely the cauliflower üòã.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Served with squid ink mayo, yuzu dressing and lardo (cured pork back fat). I love how Chef @drewnocente makes something so simple like squid taste so awesome!

Pan-seared barramundi with clams in a thin layer of prawn stock. The barramundi was cooked to perfection, its skin was lightly crisp and its flesh was oozing¬†a subtle sweetness.¬†
Semifreddo is a semi frozen dessert, somewhat lighter than an ice cream and more like a frozen mousse.\n<br />*\n<br />It was light and refreshing, a nice contrast to the heavier chocolate dessert which we also had.\n<br />*\n<br />Thanks Chef @drewnocente  for the generous treat.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This dessert, for me, was the star of the meal.\n<br />*\n<br />Mascarpone (Italian cream cheese) ice cream with amaretto (Italian liqueur) caramel on a bed of chocolate and espresso crumbs topped with chocolate tuile.\n<br />*\n<br />It wasn\'t too sweet. I also loved the contrast of the sweet amaretto caramel and the bitter espresso crumbs.\n<br />*\n<br />Thanks Chef @drewnocente for the dessert.

With wagyu ragu and beef fat crumbs.\n<br />*\n<br />Chef @drewnocente, whose parents are Australian born Italians, makes his own corzetti which was so fresh and delicious. The large circular shaped pasta was just the ideal companion for the tender ragu, topped with very sinful yet delicious beef fat crumbs.\n<br />*\n<br />I have to admit that I was a tad disappointed when I realised that Chef @drewnocente was no longer serving his corzetti with clams and his homemade sausages. His sausages were super yummy.

Such a daring combination!\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @drewnocente for sending this our way. I loved the veal heart. It had a very soft and chewy texture, much better than chicken heart (the only other heart I\'ve eaten üòÇ).

The first question which came to mind was - what is coppa?

When @blueskiescottonclouds asked whether I wanted to have lunch at @saltedandhung, all I could think of was this dish üòãüòã.

Thanks, Chef! It was gobsmackingly good!
I don\'t know what magic happens in this kitchen but they make the yummiest vegetables ever. These Brussels sprouts are really good and I\'d eat them any day.
Black truffle, coppa, confit egg and hazelnuts.
@charliebakuteh gave a thumbs up to the #wagyuribeye served with #xobutter .

I wouldn\'t have thought of ordering pasta at @saltedandhung but I saw that it was served with homemade sausages - Chef @drewnocente makes his own sausages and they are awesome! Needless to say that I enjoyed this dish immensely.\n<br />*\n<br />Although Chef @drewnocente hails from Australia, there is a fair bit of Italian influence in his cuisine. It is because his parents are Australian-born Italians. I absolutely love the food here.\n<br />*\n<br />Lunch at @saltedandhung is a very good deal - 2 courses for $25 or 3 courses for $35.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
When I saw smoked eel, I knew I had to order it. Those who know me well know I love smoked eels from Holland. They are full of Omega 3 goodness and taste so yummy without being too fishy.\n<br />*\n<br />The pate was delicious. One wouldn\'t have guessed it was smoked eel.

That was what it was called in the party menu. This was my personal favourite. Served with bacon, pickles, onions, crispies and mustard cheese.

I recently had uber delicious smoked eels and mackerel from Holland. I was immediately reminded of the cured mackerel I had at Salted and Hung. *\n<br />I love the taste of oily fish, especially when it is smoked or cured well. I can definitely say that Salted and Hung does one of the best cured mackerels in Singapore.

i love each of the five meats but if i have to make a most difficult choice, i would say the white stash in the middle - the thinly sliced Lardo with Truffled Honey - would be my favourite. FYI, Lardo is actually Pork Back Fat but it is so so sooooo damn good, there will not be an ounce of regret, i assure you.
The popcorn crumbs really tasted like the real deal. The sweetness was balanced by the mild ice cream and tart raspberry. I can imagine that kids would love this.

What was even more surprising was that I really liked it. It was definitely not one of my more memorable food experiences when I was studying in the UK.\n<br />*\n<br />I really have to thank @blueskiescottonclouds for recommending this dish. It was absolutely delicious! It was chargrilled and served with guanciale (cured pork jowl) and ricotta (whey cheese).\n<br />*\n<br />This is a seasonal item on the chalkboard.

I know I may have gone overboard but there are so many outstanding dishes on the menu that you won\'t be bored. The menu for lunch is also completely different from dinner .\n<br />*\n<br />On the way to lunch, I was telling my colleague how delicious lardo (cured fat from the back of the pig) tasted. It was as if Chef @drewnocente heard me because he sent a charcuterie board over with lardo on it! Thank you Chef- you made my day.\n<br />*\n<br />Lardo actually reminds me of chee cheong fun (rice noodle roll). It was soft and silky smooth, with a hint of truffle honey and chilli.

It may look like 2 measly sticks of fish lying in a plate but every bite of the mackerel cured in gin just sends my tastebuds dancing with joy

Super yummy and of course, it\'s because the Chef cures all his own meat.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#charcuterie #coppa #lardo #redwinesalami #saltedandhung #curing #starters #aniseedcrackers #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #whati8today #contemporaryaustraliancuisine #bscc_saltedandhung
Chef @drewnocente does an amazing job of bringing out the flavours in the meat. Even the side dishes were amazing. Not forgetting the fabulous desserts as well. Thanks @veronicaphua for the invitation.\n<br />*\n<br />We had a very lovely Prosecco to begin our dinner with (thanks Chef @drewnocente), followed by a 2014 Leeuwin Estate Siblings Shiraz from Margaret River.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #hgfoodie_alcohol #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Desserts! They were truly amazing.\n<br />*\n<br />My personal favourite was the pavlova (only available as part of the tasting menu). The toasted meringue with homemade vanilla ice cream and nitrogen frozen blood orange granita was such a delightful combination. Not too sweet with a slight burnt  meringue taste.\n<br />*\n<br />Chef Drew\'s interpretation of tim tams is a must have if you love peanut butter. Sitting on a base of chocolate, chocolate ganache and peanut butter bits with bergamot gel was milk chocolate ice cream. This was served with homemade tim tams on the side. Super yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />Everyone gets a treat of Chef Drew\'s Anzac cookies at the end of the meal. Buttery cookies made of oats and coconut with a dollop of bacon salted caramel on top. I was so tempted to buy a few more to bring home!\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you Chef @drewnocente for the lovely desserts.

Actually mashed potato with squid ink, it looked like soil in a flower pot with a budding leaf on top.\n<br />*\n<br />It was just the right creamy texture with the perfect buttery flavour.

Cured by Chef @drewnocente and pecfectly charcoal grilled in the Josper oven, this tasted sublime.\n<br />*\n<br />The sides were crispy charred and the inside still soft and tender. Every mouthful was so flavourful.

The sides were well charred, grilled in the Josper oven. For those who are less familiar, the Josper oven has a charcoal grill built into it, perfect for creating the desired char and crisp surface with meat dishes.\n<br />*\n<br />Sitting in between the pork collar and the apple slices is a thin layer of sesame and nut brittle. The sweetness of the brittle complemented the pork really well. Very yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Never knew this but the Arctic char is a cold water fish closely related to both salmon and trout. Stronger flavour and more oily compared to a trout but milder than a salmon. Served with dill and caviar.\n<br />*\n<br />This was an item on the chalkboard, not in the regular menu.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Tripe!\n<br />*\n<br />I have never had tripe done this way. Fried till crispy (crackling in fact), the tripe came with copanata (aubergine) pur√©e, sprinkled with Togarashi (Japanese chilli pepper) and Szechuan peppercorns. Great as beer bites. Can\'t stop at one!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was served with pickles, horseradish cream and a sprinkling of nori ash for added flavour. *\n<br />Curing in gin somehow brings out the best in the mackerel. It was fatty but not oily. I love fatty fish üòçüòç plenty of Omega 3.

Thank you @veronicaphua for the invitation. The kitchen is helmed by Chef @drewnocente who specialises in cured meats and in this case pork fat as well.\n<br />*\n<br />Lardo (cured fatback i.e. fat  along the back of a pig) is different from the typical lard which comes from the abdomen of a pig.\n<br />*\n<br />It looked like chee cheong fun (rice noodle rolls). The texture was soft and silky smooth. I initially thought it would be really rich and fatty but I was pleasantly surprised at how light the lardo tasted. Drizzled with truffle honey and sprinkled with chilli, it came across as buttery smooth yet light, slightly sweet with a hint of chilli. Not what I expected at all. Really yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saltedandhung #saltedandhung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
When it was time for desserts, we asked Chef Drew to surprise us. And he did, to our freaking great satisfaction. \n<br />The first to arrive was this off-the-menu, ivory-coloured fantasy spun from sugar and air, and paired with the sensuousness of a really rich, smooth ice-cream. A wonderland of textures and expertly-calibrated sweetness, it illicited the most joyous exclamations from all of us!

Part of the set lunch menu where 2 courses are served at $25++ and the 3 course set lunch menu costs $35++. Usually one who is not particularly wow-ed by popcorn desserts but this really worked very well ‚Äî definitely enjoyed this one a lot! Served with raspberry sauce, meringue and nibs of raspberry on the side, the reason why this seemed to have carried the popcorn flavour so prominently and well was probably due to the popcorn crumbs beneath the ice-cream with the pop rocks ‚Äî it\'s almost akin to having the real deal. The ice-cream wasn\'t overpowering, and that the pop rocks created an interesting popping sensation to the dish. Despite the general tartness of raspberry, the combination here worked well with a balance of sweet and berry sourness that was pretty much in harmony. This dessert also works particularly well with the Flat White ‚Äî coffee/tea/soft drinks come complimentary with the set lunch menu here.
Part of the set lunch menu where 2 courses are served at $25++ and the 3 course set lunch menu costs $35++. Opted for the barramundi as the main course and it comes with baby octopus, broth, herbs and clams. A dish that I felt was very ocean-centric ‚Äî different elements of seafood here even in the broth (the staff mentioned crabs and prawns about the broth). Loved how the barramundi is delightfully flaky, but it went especially well with the umami broth which enhanced the flavour of the otherwise, usually simple flavour of the barramundi. The clams were pretty fresh, while I love the charred baby octopus which was easy to chew. Something that would work if one is into the flavours of the sea.
Making use of the opportunity to try Salted &amp; Hung (like finally!) since they are running a promotion only for today where the set lunch for two-courses is priced at $20++ (up: $25++) and three-courses at $28++ (up: $35++).

The 6-course meal ending off on a tidal wave of emotions with @reynoldpoer\'s {Pearl Milk Tea} flaunting a clever combination of black tea ice cream, dehydrated mandarin, five spice sponge and white chocolate dulce cremeux. Spot on with the textural play and immaculate in delivery. Ten upon ten.

Full marks for passion and effort!Natural sweetness of the mussels, coupled with the smoky savoury fats of the pancetta make us mopped the entire dish clean in no time.

This was a very special and meaningful tasting for me, as I had worked for a short while at the same shop space(where Sprigs used to be) previously. Dining at @saltedandhung a few weeks ago did bring back some precious memories. :) So good to be able to have a taste of Chef @drewnocente delicious new creations, including this beautiful beetroot dish as one of the appetizers. The root vegetable was done three ways, presented with burrata and truffle honey on the plate. No unpleasant \"muddy\" taste at all!Each experience with beetroot is always a delight. A perfect vegetarian appetiser! \n<br />#EileenFoodTasting #UnlistedCollection #UnlistedChefs #SaltedAndHung #Beetroot #Vegetarian #Appetizer #OngsLaiJiak #EileenWantsToCampHere #Burpple\n<br />.\n<br />~\n<br />*Photo taken with Fujifilm X100T.\n<br />#fujifilmx_series #fujifilm_xseries #fujifilmsg #X100T #EileenX100T

Coconut sorbet, pistachio brittle &amp; fennel. Loved all the components, individually and collectively. Specially enjoyed the pistachio brittle &amp; and fennel that was sliced so thinly to give the crisp. Sorbet was heavier than expected as coconut milk was used. Pineapple used is on the sour side to complement the richness of the sorbet. Really enjoyed this!  
Love the drops of avocado puree and pomelo, added even more zest to this already refreshing dish. \n<br />Review on my blog, http://thedivaeatsprata.com/salted-hung/\n<br />#saltedandhung #unlistedcollection #trout #curedfish #fish #delicious #sgfoodie #sgfood #instafood_sg #instafoodie #instafood #foodphotography #foodstagram #burpple #burpplesg #ilovefish #food
Too many beautiful dishes to list, you just have to experience it for yourself. üòç #saltedandhung
Simple &amp; straightforward.\n<br />üíé\n<br />A mix of corn and raspberries on ice cream granules. Those little yellow dollops are buttery goodness with raspberry meringue.  The textures are uncomplicated. Ordinary ingredients that was made into a delish dessert.
I have a feeling Aussie chefs really love their \"biccies\" (biscuits), and personally, I find it fascinating to see and taste their individual spin on these crunchy delights.\n<br />For example, Chef David Pynt at Burnt Ends\' makes mini sandwiches out of them (a.k.a. Monte Carlos) with the most gobsmackingly divine cloud of smoked butter squooshed in-between.\n<br />Over at Salted &amp; Hung, Chef Drew Nocente presents the larger Anzac pimped up with cured bacon bits and a gleaming spot of semi-gooey salted caramel. Its preciousness accentuated by the presentation, all mysterious-like in a closed wooden box.\n<br />Equally amazing both of them.
So sweet, so salty, just like the sea.\n<br /> @saltedandhung @unlistedc #saltedandhung #crab #crabsalad #uni #seaurchin #delicious #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodpornsg #foodie #food #instafood_sg #instafood #instafoodie #foodstagram #burpple #burpplesg #foodphotography #foodblogger #foodporn
Let me explain.
Walked past and well....tummy calling. So decided to check out this relatively new restaurant.\n<br />üîºüîΩ\n<br />Went direct to mains. Tender pork collar that was still a teeny weeny pink inside and rested on a savoy cabbage puree which I wished silently there was more of it. It was smooth, sweet and creamy.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />The pork was accompanied by black rice ... not fluffy like white rice. Texture was like peanut smitherings, a tad crunchy and a nutty aftertaste. Da bomb in the little pile of black rice were bits of soft, chewy pork fat that elevated the rice to another level. Wow...so good!\n<br />üîºüîπ\n<br />Every morsel, every drop of sauce and puree were not spared. The plate was wiped clean. Not cos I was hungry but rather all the components presented in the dish was a perfect marriage. To me it was a happy dish and I walked out happy:) Set lunch cost $25++ &amp; $35++ for 2-course and 3-course respectively. I liked the cozy place.  Certainly will be back! Thank you Chef Drew ( hope i got your name right) @saltedandhung for coming out of your kitchen to explain the dish.\n<br />#i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #setlunch #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpplesg #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #sgig #restaurantssg #discoversg #instafollow #australian #saltedandhung #narratrs #tripadvisor
