My all time fave ice cream place! In the mood for alcoholic sundae. Yummy!!

Udders is famous for their WIDE range of  ice cream (classic, premium &amp; connoisseur). I personally love the texture of the chewy waffle, it\'s more dense &amp; soft. Give it a try, if you wanna take a break from crispy waffle ;)
Crispy thick cut fries ($9.90) topped with decadent salted egg yolk sauce, crispy curry leaves, chilli flakes &amp; toasted butter sugar cereal...everything your doctor warned you about (and against). #butsaltedeggyolk #eatfirstrepentlater
Salmon, crab meat, ebiko, dill, citrus hollandaise, and lumpfish caviar on grilled cheese #pancakes. This oceanic number was pleasing, but I preferred the more robustly flavoured Pulled Pork pancakes with its scrumptious, fork-tender bourbon bbq pork collar and crispy bacon.
kind of pricey for a cake ($12? if i remember correctly) but i really wanted cake. and the syringe is pure baileys so... crepe layers are a bit hard though
I always loved Udders\' earl Grey ice cream because the taste is really intense and the Thai milk tea is really good as well! the waffle was kinda average though
What goes best with a cup of coffee? Another cup. By Henry Rollins. Had hot mocha &amp; hot latte for today public holiday.
Essentially a chocolate-flavoured crepe-y cake with distinct layers, served with a syringe of brandy for a small dose of syrupy brandy over the cake if you are a clutch pearl type of prude, or for rampant squirtage if you are a degenerate drunk. 3.6/5
So udders now sell all day pancakes! Got a half size portion of this and the portion was just nice for me! Didn\'t expect the salmon &amp; crab to come all minced though, nevertheless, it was quite good! It was mixed in mentaiko sauce and slight spice which gave a nice kick. The cucumber pieces also gave a nice refreshing crunch. The half portion consist of 2 grilled cheddar cheese pancakes which goes quite well with the salmon crab mix. The hollandaise was suppose to be citrusy but didn\'t taste any citrus at all. Other than that, everything was good 👍🏻
This was an awesome combi! Thick cut fries topped w melted cheddar, pulled pork, sour cream, jalapeños and onions. You can\'t stop after you start.. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.
The baby girl, @chinnnnnny couldnt resist this once she saw the product advertisement in store. A mix-mash of choco balls, cookies and cream, kit kat, snickers and mars vanilla flavoured ice cream with oreos and chocolaty sauce topped with a huge waffle stick. She finished the entire thing herself, so i guess it should be pretty good! :)
Baileys Tiramisu that is... The syringe added a nice touch to the presentation 💉 
What? My first time experiencing such a combination, and what\'s more WITH PANCAKES!
Mille Crepe seems to be the in-thing now that so many cafes seems to be offer it when it used to be such a difficult item to be found in the past. Coming at $11.90 this isn\'t particularly cheap, and costs more than even Lady M\'s already pricey versions, but the Crepes are actually moist enough in between the layers with enough coffee-infused cream and cocoa to exude Tiramisu flavours, with a syringe of Bailey\'s stabbed right at the back for that alcoholic touch.
Udder mushrooms ($8)?! Deep fried bacon wrapped around white button mushrooms served with a side of curry mayo. Mmm... Abs what abs?
Sauce is not enough - which means it\'s good!! Not forgetting the creative deco around at the shop 👍
A little pricey but oh so soft and moist. Amazing amazing combination. School from 10am to 9pm and training thereafter. FUN.
Amazing textures in this dish and the explosion of flavors in your mouth... Perfect combination.
Tequila seafood pancakes ($18.90), salmon, crab and caviar pancake ($24.90) and udder shrooms ($8.90)!
At the Udders Pancake store, enjoying salted caramel ice cream topped off with a candy cane available for 12 days of Christmas 🎄
Matcha crepe cake with loads of matcha powder sprinkled on top! Creamy and yummy mmm.. 
Two pancakes the size of the bottom of a cup, an egg and some chunks of salmon and crab may not be filling for a hungry person. One can definitely go for the full (this is half), but half is already $16.90 so hmm.. The caviar on top may have called for such a price, but I doubt I\'ll go a second time for such a cost. Nevertheless the hollandaise sauce was deliciously creamy and the crab and salmon in the middle tasted great too. There\'s now an opening promotion in which you get a $15 voucher for The Udder Pancake when you buy $15 worth of ice cream at Udders, which means you get free ice cream! 
Both the matcha and chocolate flavours are really really rich in taste, 2 thumbs up! 😋
A surprise find, newly opened next to Udder\'s Ice Cream. Nice pancakes to start off the day.
Fizzy elderflower drink with few gummy bears swimming inside it. Scooped up an unwilling bear to take a shot of it.
In case of hunger, please break the door down
This is how i spend alone time with Tiramisu mille crepe with a shot of Baileys, instant intoxication. Fed some to my gummy bears and they started swimming in my sparkling elderflower drink 😂
The tiramisu mille crepe tasted good on its own. Clear layers and creamy taste, subtle coffee taste that i feel the baileys shot overpowered it. Much intoxicated now.
Pulled pork fries - shoestring fries topped with bbq pork collar , cheddar cheese, lime sour cream , jalapeño , shallot and chives
Looks like pulled pork is the IN thing nowadays! Stacked upon 2 mini pancakes, the bourbon bbq pulled pork is pressing down on it. Of the right spiciness and texture, I find it really appetising. Poached egg is topped with paprika hollandaise sauce makes it even more flavourful. Not to forget that it comes with a slice of crispy bacon!
Another new creation of egg bens. This time round topped with a mixture of smoked salmon and tasty crab meat and with a caviar finishing. The crab meat and salmon is of certain freshness and does not have any distinct smell. Overall quite a unique taste.
Baileys tiramisu $11.90 - Crepe cake that is well balanced and not too sweet and creamy. The layers are well defined and crepe is smooth and not too starchy. The innovative way of injecting the amount of baileys you need into the tiramisu adds a magical touch to it. With a tinge of alcohol in it, it makes the mille crepe cake more appetising and not that jelat.
Introducing a whole range of savoury menu including interesting items like pulled pork eggs benedict and tequila-fired prawns&amp;crispy crab, and drinks like elderflower gummy bears!! 😋😋😋
I prefer their chewy waffles much more than their crispy waffles! 
1st post on burpple dedicated to udder\'s ice cream. Their mao shan wang \n<br />and strawberry ice cream are definitely worth a try. Not the waffle though.
Ho ho ho. Good way to motivate myself to do some work tonight! 🍦
Perhaps it\'s the fact that I ordered three different alcoholic flavours - rum rum raisin, baileys and bourbon, and tiramisu - the meal turned out rather odd-tasting, in a cloyingly sweet way. Like cough mixture. So kids, don\'t get three alcoholic ice cream flavours. Also, I am not a fan of chocolate so... 
The waffle is decent and the assortment of flavours are quite a variety! 
As we approach the midweek, slow down and have a waffle from udders.
can i consider this as a mini platter for 2? lol. i had a hard time editing this cos of the lighting and all, but thankfully i\'ve got a powerful app lol. Earl Grey, Green Tea, Black Sesame ice cream, and WAFFLES! imo, this is like many times better than Haato, partly cos the ice cream can hold its temperature despite sitting on a freshly baked waffles. and err the scoop is a full scoop (value for money). Almond as toppings, Cigar Waffle is just a bit too hard to bite? just a bit, but all in all it\'s good, value for money (i think it was $12?) yum yum. who wants waffle ice cream at 1am? hehe. #udders #uddersicecream #icecream #dessert #waffles #waffle
Cup of sweet delight to end the day (:
Standards at Udders have dropped, for both waffles and ice cream. 😔\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #onthetable #sgeats #sgweekend  #burpple  #sgcafehop #waffles #icecream #gelato #sgdessert

This is Smooth Chocolate Mille Crepe from @TheUddersPancake
😂😂😂 One scoop of Chocolate and one scoop of Peanut Butter.  Did they just have a new design for their cups? It used to be just plain white cups ya?

Matcha mille crepe x classic chewy waffle with crunchy peanut, dark chocolate and matcha ice cream. Save your calories and forgo the mille crepe. Just stick to their ice cream with waffles. 
Yummy! The matcha taste is intense!
Drowning amidst deadlines, craving for some comfort food like this.
Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate! 
Anything goes well with the PANCAKES. 
MUST TRY! Just $17.90 :)
Best bang for the buck. $21.90 great for two✌️
I slurped the sauce up as if it were soup. So so good. Wish I could have this for breakfast right now.
😩 AND THE MONSTER CONE!
😋😋
