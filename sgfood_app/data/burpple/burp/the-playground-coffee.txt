Made a visit to the new eating place near NTU after a few recommendations from my friends. This donburi can be too filling because of the rice and the big portion of the chicken. I would say there\'s nothing so special about this menu except the tasty teriyaki sauce and the onsen tamago.
Cakes ($7 a slice) are \"seasonal\" in that they rotate often - check the display next to the cashier to see what they have. Here\'s a chocolate cheesecake - dense, slightly tangy, &amp; the chocolate is only a little bit sweet. It is very jelat to finish this on your own, so don\'t be greedy &amp; do share this with your friends.
Nice cafe located in the west side. Servicing nice coffee and all day breakfast. Can get quite crowded as space are limited.
Finally... a legit cafe in the west selling good coffee and food and definitely worth revisiting. I had a refreshing Cold Brew ($5.50) made from Ethiopian blends and the Salmon Grain Bowl ($16) which was really nutritious yet tasty. Salmon with a touch of salt and an assortment of vegetables, mushrooms and a sous-vide egg, on a bed barley and quinoa mix. Definitely one for the health-conscious. And also it\'s generally nice to see so many colours on my plate. My lunch date had the Hearty Breakfast ($16) and a Mocha ($6). Taste-wise, it was ok but good that the portions were generous and filling!
@theplayground.sg is now opened at Nanyang CC serving our favorite brunch items with a comforting twist!
Chilled salmon soba was refreshing with tangy sauce, edamame, cherry tomato and mushrooms. The sour flavour was delightful and increased appetite in the hot weather. 
Death\'s Nectar ($8)
Magic ($5)
Sausage &amp; Baked Eggs ($12)
Salmon Grain Bowl ($16)
Taking over the now-defunct Pits &amp; Pans is The Playground Coffee, a cafe that serves grain bowls, coffee and light bites. Prices are affordable, coffee\'s great and it\'s a short bus ride from Pioneer MRT Station ‚Äî great for NTU students to hang out with friends in between classes. Grain bowls like the Pulled Beef Grain Bowl ($16) come with usual suspects like sous vide egg, bean sprouts, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms, but we much prefer the tastier Mushroom Aglio Olio ($12). Tossed with a generous amount of mushrooms and topped with garlic breadcrumbs, it\'s flavourful and the portion is just right to not warrant a food coma after. End your meal with a sweet treat like the French Toast ($14) that comes with homemade berry compote, fresh fruits and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Wash it down with a Flat White ($5) brewed with beans from Two Degrees North Coffee Co, or treat yourself to a refreshing Virgil\'s Root Beer Float ($8) on a sweltering hot day! \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hwans Lim
Thick french toast topped w vanilla bean ice-cream, homemade zesty, sweet berry compote &amp; fresh fruits! Berry compote and the vanilla bean ice-cream pairs really well w the thick &amp; fairly dense toast. Would have been more enjoyable if the toast were to be warmer to contrast w the cold ice-cream!
A very refreshing drink that doubles up as a dessert to fight that unforgiving afternoon sun! ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüí¶
Occupying the space that used to house now-defunct Pits &amp; Pans at Nanyang Community Club is The Playground Coffee ‚Äî a new cafe that serves pasta, grain bowls, egg dishes with a small selection of cakes and desserts with specialty coffee (brewed from the Obelisk blend by Two Degrees North Coffee Co.).
For those who are thinking about the fibrous sort; the one here isn\'t quite as fibrous but its suitably sweet and rather light and fluffy; pairs well with the scoop of vanilla ice-cream served on the side that comes default with the sticky date pudding. It\'s not the best one can get, but I would probably say it\'s pretty decent and certainly satisfies those cravings for a sticky date pudding especially in this western end of Singapore.
Between this and the Pulled Beef Grain Bowl, this was the dish that I preferred. While it was a little greasy, the linguine is done al-dente and laced in oil, basil pesto and chili; quite flavourful with a hint of spiciness. While the mushrooms were bouncy, my favourite part of the pasta had to be the garlicked breadcrumbs; it adds a crisp texture to the pasta with just the right degree of garlicky flavours to turn things up a little; interesting!
Using the Obelisk blend by Two Degrees North Coffee Co., the Flat White here felt a tad under-extracted ‚Äî a little bland at first before carrying a body that seemed to lack depth. Perhaps a one-off issue where the calibration wasn\'t done to the optimum?
Price: $5
Seriously, girls and their truffle fries , what\'s so nice. Tried the shavings on the surface, it tasted like cheese shavings, am I wrong? ü§î
Multigrain toast was served toasted which was as crispy as the back bacon served! Was expecting more from the grilled mushrooms but they were fairly normal. I really like the sausage which has a good snap. It tasted like McDonald\'s sausage patty encased into sausage form! Do eat the egg when served or it\'ll turn the toast soggy if left too long! \n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan
Certainty garlicky (in a good way), but it was rather oily. Smoked duck was soft and not overcooked. üëç
Instead of soy sauce, the dish was paired with in house sauce that tasted like salad dressing. Served chilled. \n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan

Simple &amp; tasty~ üòã
That sirarcha mayo üòåüòå
But then this dish failed me. There was totally a lack of flavour in it. I can understand this might be a healthy kind of meal but I feel that this menu can still be improved.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤: $16.00\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #makansg #theplaygroundcoffee #salmon #bowl #jurong #eatoutsg #burpple #sgculinary #foodstagram #instafood #foodies #sgfoodies #sgfoodgrammers #indofoodies #instafoodies #eatgasm #foodgasm #foodphoto #foodreview #foodgrammers #healthy

It comes with vanilla bean ice cream that serves as a great accompaniment to the pudding.
This was my favorite dish over @theplayground.sg so pls order more so that they won\'t remove from the menu!!! More details on the blog - link in bio!
Flat White ($5)
It comes with mixed mushrooms that were chewy and topped with garlic breadcrumbs, giving the al-dente pasta a crisp attribute!
