The earl grey roll cake was tender and creamy with a good heavy dose of bergamot; service was awkwardly sincere and funny the way they tried so hard to balance the latte; and the decoration has a well-thought country homely feel which was unexpected. Now if only everything isn\'t so quiet, the place would be more cosy and relaxing :)
A place for a cup of decent coffee with a slice of Swiss roll... nice place to sit and relax in a Lazy weekend afternoon... within a neighbourhood !
Write a good one\" ~ Brad Paisley. May your New Year\'s Eve ring with laughter and cheer. Marking the start of a blessed New Year!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />In meantime, shall have some sweets before heading to Marina Bay for countdown party!!
The not so simple Swiss roll for $6.90 per pcs. Flavor like Thai milk tea and salted caramel, Abit ex but worth a try. Hidden gem under HDB.
Read a fair bit about their Swiss rolls and since its only a few bus stops away, decided to bring my family along to try the coffee and cakes. 
$5.90 at the Plain Jane!! Roll itself was just fluffy enough, and the matcha cream was AMAZING!!! Not too overpowering yet not too dense, with the matcha taste subtly unfolding itself with every bite. Ambience was A+ too, love their aesthetic. Definitely going back to try their other rolls!!
Giving in to temptation. Back at Plain Jane over the weekend to try their newest additions, Mont Blanc and Rum &amp; Raisin. I personally prefer the latter despite it not having a strong alcohol taste. However the smooth fragrant cream in fluffy roll makes up for it!
I can\'t stop at one bite.
Light and fluffy Swiss rolls -Nutella, earl grey and Thai Milk tea.\n<br />I be back for the matcha.
Crisp outer layer, melt in your mouth meringue, mild sweetness and hint of sourness from the raspberry üëçüèªüëçüèª
Tried thai milk tea(in the picture) and matcha swiss roll. It was not bad.. i seldom take sweet stuff. So this is good to me as it was not too sweet nor creamy for me. There isnt that too \"gelat\" feel even after finishing the swiss roll.. though i thought that the pastry part is a little dry. But its worth a try if you havent try it for yourself. ;)
.
Really really like this meringue roll.  The texture of the meringue, the fresh cream and hint of tartness from the raspberry combines to make this a winner.
.
Essentially the airy between-the-cake-sheets love child of soft, clayey meringue and chewy marshmallow. 3.8/5
Due to some unpleasantries involving an unprofessionally rude and Woon-ding (sic) PR email - they teach salutations and signoffs in secondary school letter-writing, don\'t they? - I\'ve decided not to visit the Pok√©mon Caf√© pop-up at EWF Bugis Junction happening from 27 May 2016 - 31 July 2016. The EWF people have always been lovely though, and based on my experience at several Pok√©mon food concepts in Japan in the past few years, I expect the food to visually deliver as well. Hope all you Pok√©mon fans enjoy the Pok√©mon Caf√© experience!
.\n<br />Other people\'s breakfast just seems to be nicer then mine, even if it\'s just a couple of plain bread. üòû
Looking for a friendly neighborhood cafe that serves up one of Singapore\'a best Swiss Rolls? The Plain Roll [$4.90], Cappuccino [$5] At Cafe Plain Jane along Seragoon.
It would be very nice to bring her out on a high tea session like this üëÜüèª, so I bought home some Yuzu and Coffee rolls ($5.90) for her to try!
Besides that, these Swiss rolls make for a perfect gift during visiting (since its Mother\'s Day tomorrow). My recommendation will be to go with the Matcha Swiss Roll ($5.90) with its subtle hint of matcha and creamy goodness from the whipped cream.
The meringue stood out for being different your typical Swiss roll.  The salted caramel less so but was still decent.
Hot weather. Just want to have a slice of fluffy Matcha Swiss roll ($5.90), and maybe a glass of iced Matcha Latte ($6.50).
I don\'t know how people judge scones but hey, this wasn\'t cloyingly dry, and that was good enough for me!
Incredibly delightful as a snack with a cup of tea in the morning or the afternoon. The cream was light and fluffy, and the slightly tart strawberries helped to balance out the cream and the slightly soggy and sweet meringue. The earl grey, was simply eating a cup of earl grey tea in a light and not too sweet sponge cake. While these are unlike the Rich and Good rolls where every mouthful makes you exclaim \'shiok!\', these rolls from The Plain Jane possess a rustic charm and do not overpower your palate, perfectly enjoyed in their quiet and cosy little shop under a block of flats. Not quite the plain Jane after all - in a good way.
Back here again for more flavours, Earl Grey and Thai Milk Tea at $5.90 each. Enjoyed them where both Swiss roll leans towards a lighter taste, best paired with their selection of tea. \n<br />There are new flavours available such as Yuzu, meringue and salted caramel. Probably the best place for Swiss rolls. üç∞
Anytime for light and balanced swiss rolls.\n<br />Joining the ranks of the popular matcha and thai milk tea flavour is coffee swiss roll; rich in coffee fragrant and ended off with a bitter sweet note.
Delicate and airy meringue roll laced with slight sourish berries jam, it\'s a perfect balance for the otherwise sweet dessert. Lightly coated almond slices also add a nutty taste to it!!
Really nice and delectable earl grey Swiss Roll ~ probably one that is among the best cakes i have eaten. Really nice environment and the staff were friendly:) I\'m going to try their matcha the next time. It looks so nice!
Wish I can roll Monday away. Or wish I can roll forward to the weekend. Blessed week everyone.
Plain Jane cafe specializes in homemade Swiss rolls that are baked fresh daily. Arrived in the evening to know that all rolls were sold out. Chilled an hour over tea and ordered a freshly baked matcha roll. The texture leans towards the denser end, not your soft and fluffy kind. Still overall a good eat :) Will try the earl grey next!
Never been a fan of swiss rolls and cream, so imagine my surprise when I found Plain Jane\'s to be nothing but stunning. The strong flavours, though mellowed and made subtle for this light dessert, were discernible and really fragrant. I really liked the Thai Tea and Matcha, and I\'d return to try their Earl Grey!
Apart from their popular swiss roll, there are also some seasonal bakes available which are worth trying. If you are feeling lucky that day, perhaps you may just lay your hands on one.
Attention all easties, your side of Singapore just got better ‚Äî again. Located within the heartlands of Serangoon is The Plain Jane, a cosy vintage-themed cafe where you can unwind and learn a thing or two about slow-living from Jane, the owner. For the uninitiated swiss roll eater, go for the freshly-made The Plain Roll ($4.90), a light, fluffy cake encasing a generous amount of smooth, melt-in-your-mouth cream that will ease you right into the club. Also try the crowd favourite Thai Milk Tea Not So Plain Roll ($5.90), or other limited edition flavours like Earl Grey, Matcha and Nutella Chocolate. These flavours come in limited in quantities, so be sure to head over early to secure the ones that you want. Sit back and relax with a cup of Ette Tea Mango Sticky Rice ($8 per pot) ‚Äî you read that right, its genmaicha and black tea infused with diced mango and candied coconut bits for that extra fruity sweetness. Seasonal brunch items are also available, just check with Jane. Pro tip: To order a whole roll, contact them at least three to seven days in advance!
So rich and so flavorful! Their cream is made of the number 1 brand tea leaves! No wonder it\'s so GAO and aromatic! Even my gudetama wants a piece of it!
.\n<br />Rich and creamy chocolate swiss roll with choco pops hidden within, providing an additional crunch to the classic flavour. [$5.90]\n<br />.\n<br />üì∑: @cassakating \'s camera.
Bought back the Plain Jane Swiss Roll ($4.90) for mummy and their yummy Thai Milk Tea Swiss Roll for YOU, @yingz_84 (make sure @mokkked comes to collect it HAHA).\n<br />.\n<br />üöá Serangoon. (10 mins walk). 211 Serangoon Avenue 4, #01-10. Singapore 550211.
A cosy and minimalist cafe which located just across Serangoon Stadium where they peoples will visit for their signature Swiss roll and teas. We ordered their signature swiss roll (plain, green tea, and also Earl Grey). Im a dessert lover but it\'s doesn\'t mean a dessert but be sweet as sugar. Their Swiss roll is just nice for me especially their Early Grey! A sip of tea and a bite of cake will made my day there! 
Chocolate swiss roll ($5.90) is another new flavour launched and as you dig in the fluffy roll, you\'ll find bits of choco pearls hidden inside. Accompany with a cup of fragrant Pandan Chiffon tea ($8 per pot) that is inspired by our local dessert cake, for an enjoyable afternoon.
A strong tea taste yet remains moist and fluffy. As I\'m not a tea person, we can\'t resist the rich Matcha roll that had light matcha cream 
These updated takes on the classic swiss roll is a refreshing change to the waffles, pancakes proliferating in the SG cafe scene.  My favorites so far are the raspberry and the matcha (not in pic); Both were light and subtle.  The bergamot flavor comes through quite strongly in the earl grey roll so get it if you\'re a tea lover. \n<br />So glad to have a nice cafe somewhere so close to home. :)
This new cafe in my neighborhood is by the folks behind the Rich &amp; Good Cake Shop.  Go for the matcha roll.  Coffee\'s not too shabby either. \n<br />Nice meeting you finally @croissantqueen :)
.
Loving the interior and vintage furniture so there\'s even more excuse to drop by. Selection of Swiss rolls shown here: Red Currant, Matcha, Thai Milk Tea and Nutella Chocolate ($5.90). Moist, light and utterly delicious, I wanted to order everything on the shelf but was stopped üòÇ Personal favourites are rich Matcha and decadent Nutella Chocolate. Can\'t wait for the X\'mas dishes to be out!! Thanks Jane for taking time to talk to us and introducing the delightful rolls.
.\n<br />Not-so-plain Swiss Roll [$5.90] is Jane\'s take on slow-living; embrace simplicity with occasional perks. Swiss roll flavours are dependent on Jane\'s mood with limited quantity daily.\n<br />.\n<br />Lucky me managed to lay my hands on the THAI MILK TEA roll. The rich thai milk tea fragrance with occasional tea bits pack a powerful punch to my taste bud.\n<br />.\n<br />I\'m sold.
.\n<br />Unlike any other Jane, this plain Jane stole my attention whenever i pass by with its pretty interior and heart-felt bakes that I had to shamlessly go knocking on people\'s door even when it\'s not in operation yet.\n<br />.\n<br />Serving you really soon from 5th Dec onwards.
Would be nice to have a relaxing tea time to slow things down with a Swiss roll or two üòâ
üòù This Earl Grey Swiss Roll ($5.90) certainly has done her job very well. Prominent earl grey flavor in the fluffy cream without being bitter nor overly sweet. The sponge cake is soft and not dry. I\'m not keen on swiss rolls but this one is quite nice üòä

This cosy cafe serves really awesome swiss rolls.  Our favourite has to be their original flavour - so soft and moist - it was the first plate to be wiped clean.

Taste for Thai milk tea isn\'t strong enough for me. Matcha was good but my favourite will still be the Earl Grey one.

The pretty interior decor of this place will definitely draw you in. Enjoyed the afternoon over good coffee and matcha swiss roll. Fluffy, light sponge cake filled with sweet matcha cream. Love how the matcha cream wasn\'t too overpowering with a faint bitter matcha aftertaste.
