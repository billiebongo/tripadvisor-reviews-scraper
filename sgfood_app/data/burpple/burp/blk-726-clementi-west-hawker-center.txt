the queue for this stall can be kinda insane at times. thankfully not today
could oso see the uncle clearly enjoying his work, dancing around the area and churning out this great this. it was a sight to behold. could do with abit more egg, but well finally satisifed my carrot cake craving after yesterdays poor
Soon Lee fish ball noodle, every Saturday eating the same thing. 
Arguably the best Mee Pok I have ever had! The noodle texture is just nice, sauce is perfect and not overwhelming. And not overly oily!
Lousiest hokkien mee ever! Boycott this stall #01-189! 1) Hokkien mee was precooked in a tray so it was soggy. 2) All yellow noodles, barely any white ones. 3. For $3.50 a plate, there was only 2 prawns and 2 measly pieces of squid.
This was so carefully and painstakingly made by the stall owner. A mixture of saltiness from the chilli sauce, sweetness from the chopped peanuts and crunchiness from the fried flout bits. Would prefer more vegetables other than just turnip for the main ingredient. 
Just helped myself to a large serving of granny\'s lotus root soup! üòã #horjiak
Polished off every bit of the Nasi Lemak Rice. Sooo fragrant! #homecooked #homemade #dinner 
The best thing stinking my fridge for days, Maoshanwang Durians! #happy #fruits 
Have not been here for Red Ruby from this hawker for 3 years. Good to be back in West Coast. #redruby #desserts #foodporn #burpple #foodphotography #nofilter #red
Rainy day comfort. Such a nostalgic bowl of laksa that brings back memories of the one sold in my primary school canteen, and it costs only $2.50! It\'s more than worthwhile for the generous portion of thick beehoon given, several slices of fish cake, more than 10 (small) cockles. Felt less sinful after drinking the laksa gravy that wasn\'t very rich yet addictive. It didn\'t have the creamy coconut milk taste as well, but finished off well with the herbaceous touch of the laksa leaves. Add in the spoonful of sambal chili provided if the level of spiciness of the gravy isn\'t of any kick!
The yong tau fu are all handmade which are not only large but filled with generous amount of meat filling and it\'s not oily at all even though it\'s fried. -\n<br />My family went down few days ago when the old couple is working the soup base is different which is much more flavourful but today which is another man maybe the son, the soup taste like corn soup although it\'s still good. After finishing the whole bowl i doesn\'t feel thirsty at all. 9/10 \n<br />#totallyworthit
The fish slice are fresh and soup is tasty.

Whatever left in the tray, you just dump it into the wok, warm it up and served your customer.
