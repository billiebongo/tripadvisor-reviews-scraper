Noodle dishes are usually the ones I look out for in Chinese and Zi Char restaurants to help determine a second visit, and Diamond Kitchen whips up a mean plate of Fried Bee Hoon using their signature Gan Xiang sauce! It was fragrant, studded with fresh prawns, mussels and slices of pork belly, but the best part of all, was the bee hoon that fully soaked up the slightly spicy-sweet addictive sauce. It was so packed with flavour and a nice amount of heat that this one-size portion meant for 4 will be gone in minutes! 
For $368++, diners will get 2 whole Boston lobsters, 2 whole squid and tons of prawns, snow crab legs, scallops, black mussels and flower clams — enough to feed 6 - 8 people. They also have the smaller size at $188++ for 3-4 pax. Beneath the treasure box were sauna stones that continued to steam and keep these seafood warm. One can definitely taste the freshness and sweetness of these seafood gems, and even dip them into four diffferent sauces (Hong Kong Steam Sauce, Garlic Chilli, Black Bean Chilli and Gan Xian Sauce) or the super addictive belachan chilli (which I dip everything into!). Seafood lovers, you\'ll definitely love this!
SEAFOOD PARTAYEEEE with Diamond Kitchen\'s newest menu items!💃🏻 7 types of steamed seafood over a bed of hot sauna stones with stock poured all over - result was seafood in its natural sweetness and juiciness. The 7 types include Boston lobsters, clams, mussels, snow crab legs, prawns, scallops and squids. It\'s also served along with 4 homemade dips, Hong Kong Steam Sauce, Garlic Chili Sauce, Black Bean Chili Sauce and Gan Xiang Sauce (but psst, I would dip anything and everything in their amazing balacan)! There is also a smaller portion at $188 consisting the same 7 types. Do note that this special anniversary dish is only available in its Science Park Drive outlet.
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />Pitch black in colour, the wobbly slabs of braised pork belly are so melt-in-the-mouth tender you need to be reeeeeeaaally careful when picking them up to place in the puffy embrace of each freshly-steamed \"pau\".\n<br />I know it isn\'t the norm to have \"Kong Bak Pau\" with \"sambal belachan\" but to me, it\'s a lip-smacking combination. Especially with Diamond Kitchen\'s kickass one that\'s made in-house. \n<br />This dish is one of several that have been created to mark Diamond Kitchen\'s 3rd Anniversary. You can savour it at a 15% discount at both the Laguna Park and Science Park Drive outlets between now and 31st December 2016 (usual price: $18++/$36++). Come January 2017, these dishes will become a permanent fixture on their menu.\n<br />.\n<br />Many thanks to @burpple @sixthsensepr for the kind invitation to this tasting. And thank you @diamondkitchensg for your generousity.
Awesome dinner last evening with the Burpple Tastemakers, look at the spread and amount of seafood we had!\n<br />🔸\n<br />We were grabbing really fresh Boston lobsters, scallops, black mussels, large prawns, squid and snow crab legs that had been soaking up Diamond\'s secret stock in a sauna tub. Hot stones are first heated till red hot and placed underneath the seafood before pouring the stock over. This generates the steam that continually bathe the seafood in this \"sauna\". I like the juiciness and sweetness of the seafood, both coming from its inherent freshness and from the stock 😋\n<br />🔸\n<br />Credits : Wonderful dinner and evening at @diamondkitchensg with the @Burpple Tastemakers and Veronica from @sixthsensepr, thank you for the invite, hosting and feeding :)
Tender and thoroughly braised chunks of pork belly in hot fluffy steamed buns! The pork belly wasn\'t overly fatty, meat to fat ratio was just nice.
Woke up today with a craving for this! 🌧 Was genuinely surprised with the use of kampung chicken in this herbal dish since most restaurants wouldn\'t opt for it for its smaller size and lesser fats, even though I\'ve always loved it\'s succulent meat. The meat here was steamed super tender and it separated from its bones effortlessly. Paired with the fragrant sweet tasting broth that was a result of the herbs stuffing used, it\'s a very comforting dish that\'s easy to finish. Enjoyed it very much! #BurppleBestChinese
This Kong Bak Pau ($18, $36) from @diamondkitchensg went through my mind many many times since I sunk my teeth into one last week 😋
誰說(魷)魚與熊掌不可兼得？ (Who say you can\'t have both your cake and eat it). With the Diamond Sauna Treasures ($188, $368), you definitely can! \n<br />Tickled by how the whole set-up looking like a bear paw while filled with uber fresh seafood - Think prawns, Boston lobsters (!!), snow crab legs, scallops, squids, mussels and sweet flower clams. The method of using sauna bath captures the full flavour and sweetness of the seafood. Personally, I felt that eating it on its own was really good enough (it is THAT good). However, the 4 accompanying dips elevates the flavours very well too - Hong Kong Steam Sauce, Garlic Chili Sauce (🌶), Black Bean Chili Sauce (🌶🌶) and their signature Gan Xiang Sauce (🌶🌶🌶). I really like the super fragrant Gan Xiang sauce, spicy but shiok!
Well, they\'ve upgraded this classic to a full-fledged \'Diamond Sauna Treasures\' (avail. only at Science Park Drive) featuring a spread of 7 different seafood - Boston lobster, prawns, snow crab legs, scallops, black mussels, clams and squid.
B U R P P L E  E A T U P\n<br />Guaranteed to impress is this humongous $368++ \"Diamond Sauna Treasures\". What\'s in there? More like what\'s not in there! I swear the ocean suddenly seems a lot emptier 😆\n<br />Anyway, the two Boston lobsters, crab claws, snow crab legs, scallops, prawns, squid, mussels and clams had been partially cooked before being arranged over the special hot stones within this special steamer basket to continue cooking as it was brought to the table. I can assure you when the lid is lifted and the steam rises in a cloud to reveal the contents, it\'s inevitable for everyone at the table to go \"Waaaaaaah!\"\n<br />The natural sweetness of all the seafood was already really lovely but the four accompanying dips took things up a few notches. There was a Hongkong-style soya sauce, a garlic chilli (which had the vibes of a chicken rice chilli), a black bean chilli sauce and the restaurant\'s signature \"gan xiang\". Don\'t ask me to pick a favourite because they were all tasty mixed and matched in their own way. \n<br />Do note the \"Diamond Sauna Treasures\" is only available at the Science Park Drive branch. And if you are dining in a smaller group, you can always opt for the $188++ version.\n<br />What\'s most interesting though is between now and 31st December 2016, diners enjoy a 15% discount on this and the other new dishes that have been created to celebrate Diamond Kitchen\'s 3rd Anniversary. Come January, they will become a permanent part of the menu but isn\'t it better to take advantage of the promotional prices before then? 😊
In conjunction with Diamond Kitchen\'s 3rd Anniversary, they have launched several dishes that\'s bound to delight you.
Succulent chunks of braised pork belly between warm steamed buns with cucumber slices for a little crunch. Give me this any time! Build your own Kong Bak Pau and load it up with multiple slices of the tender pork belly (cos the more the merrier), then enjoy it as is or add a dash of Diamond Kitchen’s homemade sambal chilli sauce for a little kick.\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />Diamond Kitchen\n<br />#01-01, 87 Science Park Drive, Singapore 118260\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />#DiamondKitchenSG #DiamondSeafoodSG\n<br />#KongBakPau #PorkBelly
A sweet and refreshing end to last Tuesday’s dinner tasting at Diamond Kitchen. 
Slight crust on the outside and still soft in the inside. Mum-in-law said ask if they braised their own trotters, if not don\'t order. Haha... So we asked, yes, they braised their own trotters. Yums! We will be back for it.
Veggies with bLARDy tasty coz there\'s lard and salted fish.
😋😋😋 not sure if they added tenderizers on it (probably they did), it\'s really juicy and tender. Comparing to XO pork rib, I find that this one is really sweet and blends well with the pork! Cool stuff. \n<br />#champagneporkrib #chinesecuisine #eatsg #porkribs #ribs #chinesefood #burpple
If it sizzles in a Claypot with some meat and salted fish, it\'s so yummy!
Kids please behave and eat your food slowly. Thank you. Huat ah!
Somehow feel like eating more Chinese food as the Lunar New Year is approaching.
Star of my family\'s recent gathering. They are one hard gang to please, but the crab stole all the hearts and tastebuds. I did fore-warn about the spice, but I think they were slightly taken aback by how spicy but yet unstoppably tasty this crab dish brings. Runny nose and teary eyes could not stop them from licking off the sauce. \"Now this is special\", said most of my family. SCORE! 
It must be a sign. Time for crab \"party\"?! haha.\n<br />•\n<br />Wish that a plate of #DiamondKitchenSG\'s Gan Xiang Crab will magically appear in front of me right now!.\n<br />•\n<br />Sri Lankan crab wok-fried with over 20 different spices &amp; ingredients, with homemade sambal, two types of curry powder, soy bean paste amongst them.\n<br />•\n<br />Plump, succulent chunks of crab meat coated with aromatic spicy, peppery sauce. Finger lickin\' good!
A different approach to the traditional drunken prawns with the herbal stock poured in and the hot stones causing that to steam, enveloping and infusing the prawns with the light Chinese wine flavour. Definitely a memorable spectacle. #Burpple #BurppleTastemakers #BurppleEatup
Huge crab for two, 1.3kg at $88. Salty egg yolk goes well with everything, so it does with crab. Lovely! Don\'t forget to order mantou to dip into the sauce!
Delicious lala bee hun at $14 for the small portion. We ordered this for two, there were more lala than the bee hun. The soup/broth is the key to the tastiness of the dish! Yum! Service is very good, comes with free valet parking too! We even got a free gift at the end of the meal from some lucky draw. 
5 munchies: The star dish from all the Tastemakers\' eatups I\'ve attended thus far – clean-tasting Sri Lankan crab meat that was so chunky and succulent, oozing natural sweetness. Here comes the salted egg sauce that was smashing – thick, creamy and buttery with a smooth consistency. What made the savoury sauce stand out from the rest was the addition of curry leaves and chilli padi for some nutty aroma and kick. If only we had deep-fried man tous or fries to wipe the plate clean!
Looks like this is going on the list of favourites! Awesome Chinese food - everything we tried was great! Definitely go for their clam noodles which is one of their specialties 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Curly bacon are the in thing. Our veggie dish has curly bacon. 😂
4.5 munchies: With the savoury umami stock so rich and full of flavour, the plain bee hoon braised in it was infused with all the seafood and wolfberry sweetness. The briny hints and Chinese rice wine in the superior stock also complemented the abundance of fresh lala (clams), which left me craving for more with the delicate rice vermicelli.
these beancurd bars had so much dropped by diamond kitchen at recent family dinner. approval from family and you know what, so rightfully so. for starters, this star dish at diamond kitchen has the freshest in-house made tofu from the hands of a 25 years of experience culinary chef. for the lovely gold color and rich pumpkin sweetness, both the young and old pumpkin are used. scallop and prawn dresses up the dish but do little to better this already uberlicious pumpkin sauce.
The clams lend this dish a rich, umami flavour. The broth has this subtle sweetness that pleases the palate. My kind of comfort food!
Though this restaurant is far and difficult to get in (Science Park), the dishes were spot on. Loved the salty egg yolk calamari. Will be back. *Shine bright like a diamond*
Yummilicious lobster porridge. All the essence and sweetness of the fresh lobster is locked into this thick porridge broth! Both the lobster and porridge is just too awesome to not try!
5 munchies: These live tiger prawns were doused in Chinese wine with wolfberries and Chinese Angelica root (dang gui) before getting steamed over hot stones in a bamboo basket. They were so fresh and crunchy that I wished I didn\'t have to share them with 9 other Burpple Tastemakers!
5 munchies: Slices of pork rib meat marinated overnight and then glazed with a secret champagne sauce that was mildly sweet, salty and tangy. I loved how they were boneless, not too greasy and most importantly, the meat was so moist and tender! This has got to be the best pork ribs I\'ve eaten yet.
Whammied by the flu bug and even my voice has left the building 😶 Need some nourishing comfort food pronto.
HOW?
This is one of those dishes that you just cannot stop reaching for once you stop. Conveniently cut into bite-sized chunks, the juicy morsels of chicken are lightly battered and deep-fried, and showered in confetti of crispy cereal flakes – curry leaves and chilli padi give it a nice kick.
Yam paste, or orh nee, is a popular Teochew dessert. Steamed yam paste mashed till fine texture, topped with soft gingko nuts and thin slices of steamed pumpkin and aromatic coconut milk.
Live tiger prawns doused in Chinese wine, steamed for several minutes over hot stones in a bamboo basket together with some wolfberries and Chinese angelica root, aka dang gui.
Had this twice this week – once with the @burpple Tastemakers and the second time with the family for Father\'s Day, and it\'s been a hit with everyone who\'s tried it; including my Grandma, who\'s probably Singapore\'s hardest Chinese food critic.
Heading to @diamondkitchensg in a bit for a belated Father\'s Day celebration lunch, and my mouth is already watering with the anticipation of all the goodness that will be entering it.
Fresh, sweet Sri Lankan Crab wok-fried in thick, luscious &amp; creamy salted egg sauce, curry leaves and chilli padi.
Luxuriously creamy, with sweet sliced pumpkin, soft gingko nuts, and lots of coconut milk. Diamond Kitchen nails it every time.
The smoothest, the creamiest, award would go to this plate of beauty. If they have fried mantou on the side, I would used them to drip and clean up the plate. The smell of the curry leaves and salted egg was so divine, ignited and wetted my appetite, and the colour was so inviting. The meat was so succulent, and clean and fresh. Dip that into the sauce and you will definitely go mmmmmmm ☺️
Not all salted egg sauces are made equal – Diamond Kitchen\'s clearly outshines almost all others (if not all) with the perfect balance of flavour and texture.
5 munchies: You can\'t go wrong with Diamond Kitchen\'s zesty gan xiang sauce in any of their wok-fried dishes, which is also used for the crab in my earlier post. The deep-fried chicken chunks were crispy and juicy, complementing the spicy flavours of the al dente rice. This dish was nostalgic for me for tasting as good as my grandma\'s sambal fried rice with hae bee hiam (spicy dried prawns) and Peranakan flavours.
Another unforgettable dish at @diamondkitchensg
finessed and elevated with a superior master stock befitting royalties to consume, the uber richness of the broth fused with the wholesome eggy fragrance of three is unmistakable. another noteworthy is the sudden jolt of sweetness from the lovely wolf-berries making the dish almost tasting and looking dessert-like.
Signature item. The sauce is made from over 20 whopping different spices and ingredients!! The spicy homemade sauce gives a good contrast to the sweet flesh of the fresh Sri Lankan crab. There\'s two types of curry powder and homemade sambal so it\'s pretty spicy to me (By the way, their sambal sauce is the bombdiggity!! I don\'t eat spicy stuff much but this, I\'d make an exception). 
 My favourite dish to order in Chinese restaurants, and this was simplicity at its best. A well-balanced dish. No frills, comforting in a way, with great tasting sweet stock and 3 eggs (chicken, salted duck and century egg) 
Gan Xiang crab vs salted egg crab. Gan Xiang is a special sauce made by the head chef, it is made of 30 ingredients including 2 types of curry and ppl that know it is sworn to secrecy. It is a mean sauce that is peppery and spicy. As for the salted egg yolk sauce, there is enough oomph and you can really taste the salted egg distinctly. Gan Xiang crab definitely wins in term of uniqueness but salted egg yolk crab would win on tastiness. 
4.5 munchies: These bite-sized nuggets of chicken coated in salted egg batter were so crispy that they crackled as I was munching on them. I could snack on these with a pint of draught beer anytime of the day!
($26/39/52) These live prawns were a little small, but tasted so good. Interestingly, it involves steaming over hot-stone at the bottom of this cute bamboo basket, thus, sauna. Like drunken prawns, they were doused in Chinese wine, dang gui and wolfberries making it sweet with light herbal fragrance. 
Live Tiger Prawns bathed with aromatic Chinese wine, wolfberries and dang gui, then sauna-ed in a steamy bamboo basket with hot stones (hidden beneath) is such a great cooking method to date back to before the discovery of fire.
OMG! Such fresh juicy crabs with rich yummy salted egg yolk sauce! I am missing this already! *drools *
2 types of curry powder, home-made sambal, soy bean paste and 15+ other spices &amp; ingredients surely have done a magnificent job on the Sri Lankan crab.
5 munchies: Wok-fried with over 20 different spices and ingredients including the zesty homemade sambal, two types of curry powder, and soybean paste, this signature dish is sure to impress and set your tongues on fire. The Sri Lankan crab was so fresh and perfectly cooked that I could easily bite off the juicy and chunky meat! I\'d give it 5.5 munchies had it been just a little spicier. 
When the intoxicating aroma of the Superior Stock Clam Bee Hoon ($14/21/28) preceded its entrance at our table, I knew then, that it was going to be stellar. Boozy kick aside, the Chinese cooking wine also gave the dish more body and character, gradually mellowing into a delicate sweetness, thanks to the abundance of fresh la la clams and smattering of goji berries that adorned those silky braised rice noodles.
Definitely my favorite of the night!! Thanks Burpple &amp; Diamond Kitchen for having us - this made me really happy. Fresh Sri Lankan crab, with rich, creamy, absolutely tasty salted egg sauce. Finger-lickin\' good!
The June Tastemakers\' Eatup at Diamond Kitchen last night was the best one yet! Thank you, Diamond Kitchen and Burpple, for having us!
Despite the unappealing looks of this dish. I found it extremely pleasing to it. Especially after a fellow tastemaker taught me the way of how his family eats this desert, helped me to get a more balanced taste of the desert. It was to stir and stir until the yam paste was completely well mixed with the milk and proceed with savaging the dish! 😋
Thanks Burpple for tonight\'s food tasting session. Colourful, sensational and beautiful. Every dish is so divine, more of them in detail soon! *burpssss*
This is the most difficult dish I\'ve ever tried to take a pic of. That aside, this bad picture didn\'t justify how tasty and comforting the hot dessert was after all the rich food. Is it true that almost all girls love orh nee? Well, arguably, but this truly stole my heart.
Commonly featured as the perfunctory end-off at Chinese wedding banquets, the humble \'Orh Ni\' dessert may be simple and ubiquitous, but it\'s so intricately-linked to Teochew cuisine that no meal of its kind would seem complete without it.
The clams were really fresh for this dish and the broth was superb! Each sip has a rich seafood taste and one could feel the different layers of tasting even when repeatedly eaten! This version felt very traditional and reminds me of the food that my grandma cooks! ($14/$21/$28)
The briny stock was certainly stellar, infused with so much flavour from the clams and seafood it tasted like the sea, minus the saltiness. The abundant clams were fresh and I was busy licking the stock off the shells.
The rice is fried with their signature Gan Xiang sauce, which makes it similar to sambal fried rice but not as pungent. The rice was cooked perfectly - not too sticky or soft. The deep fried chunks of chicken in the rice really left me craving for more. 
The star of this dish had to be the broth. It was extremely tasty due to the generous amounts of clams added, and the addition of wolfberries added extra sweetness. The clams itself were fresh, and there was no hint of any fishiness. Not too heavy a dish as well, considering we had it towards the end of the meal. 
The title \"superior\" there was no exaggeration as the broth was indeed very strong and delish. The more we drink the soup, the tastier it becomes. I was surprised with the generous amount of fresh, plump la la clams (and the tiny little baby crabs) amidst strings of bee hoon. This would be a perfect dish to have on a rainy day.
Urgh, it\'s like having a taste of Penang right here in Singapore. I swear, this plate is too good, that it\'s beyond good. It\'s sex, sex in the mouth. The broth is so thick, so slurp worthy, so flavorful, that it\'s a pity that the broth is not enough. Those fresh Lala enhance the broth, making it sweet and delish with a hint of the sea. Every aspect of the dish complements and dances very well together. One of the best, in Singapore by my standard yet! 
The stock was indeed superior in its beautifully sweet robustness but the clams were just as impressive with their crunchy succulence and freshness. I liked that the chef used beehoon - the absorbent texture was just what the stock needed. If you\'re after some carbs to round off a feast of their amazing crab dishes, I\'d recommend this.\n
When asked which was the better crab among this and the gan Xiang one, I had to think really hard to make a decision. This salted egg crabs\' sauce were so creamy and delicious that I licked all my fingers clean after finishing up the crabs! The sauce was addictive and of sufficient quantity. Will come back if I ever have a salted egg craving!
For those who are in search of a really spicy kind of chili crabs, you are certainly up for a treat. Just from looking at those crabs already triggered some of my predator senses and I could feel myself starting to salivate. Indeed the chili had a lot of kick and the crabs were incredibly sweet and tender! It is rare nowadays to find crabs that are of quality and I am really happy to get to know of this place! 
Luscious and creamy salted egg sauce that was so good that I wanted to lick the plate dry. The Sri Lankan crab was super fresh and the sauce brought out the sweetness of the crab meat rather than overpower it. My favourite dish of the night!
I enjoyed dipping my favourite part of the crab, its roe, in the luscious creamy salted egg sauce. The curry leaves help the chilli padi in adding an extra bit of spiciness to the dish. The strong fragrance definitely made us drool last night.
My favourite dish of the night. The sight of this alone was enough to make me start drooling. The crab was fresh with an abundant amount of flesh. However, the star had to the wet salted egg sauce that was generously doused over the crab. Unlike other salted egg crabs, the sauce here is wetter and a lot of creamier. This results in the sauce really being absorbed by the crab so each bite is oh-so sinful and delicious. Towards the end, I was dipping the crab in the sauce because I just could not get enough of it. The sauce is seriously finger-licking good stuff. Must order this when here if you\'re a fan of salted egg dishes. 
The sauce, made with over 20 different spices and ingredients, was unique with a mellow spiciness to it. However, felt that the spices masked the sweetness of the crab. Or it could just be that I am not a big fan of spicy food. 
You would have thought that you have tried every possible variation you can imagine on this Tiny island, that you couldn\'t think of another way to cook Singapore\'s favorite seafood. But Diamond Kitchen managed to be a notch above many reputable restaurants. Sri Lanka crabs fried with over 20 different spices and ingredients, this dish gave a edge over others for its sight, smell and taste. Although spicy, it\'s one of those kind whereby you simply can\'t stop yourself. And please don\'t think of any dainty way to devour this delish plate of goodness, the only way is to get it down and dirty. 😍👍
Chilli and Black Pepper Crab too mild &amp; mainstream for you?  Revitalise those jaded taste buds with the Diamond Gan Xiang Crab, somewhat like a cross between the two. Huge Sri Lankan crabs tossed in a potent mix of 20 different spices &amp; ingredients including their homemade sambal sauce, two types of curry powder, and soy bean paste to set off an explosion of flavours that leave a pleasing, tingling sensation after.
As their signature dish, this did not disappoint. The Sri Lankan crab was humongous and fresh - the meat was fresh and very easy to peel out. It was wok fried in their special Gan Xiang sauce made in house from over 20 ingredients. It includes homemade sambal and 2 types of curry powder, which makes for a fiery experience in your mouth. It is a nice change from your typical chilli/black pepper crabs but still retains all the amazing spiciness that we all love and enjoy. 
Let\'s face it, it\'s hard to take a good picture of this dish but when something tastes so fabulous, looks cease to matter. The creator of it is the head chef at Diamond Kitchen who hails from Malaysia. And according to fellow Tastemaker Rachel Xie, this is his \"signature of signature dishes\". I can understand why. The deeply fragrant, multi-faceted \"secret sauce\" that the Sri Lankan crabs is cooked with, is made from about 20 spices. They include a fermented soya bean paste that\'s prepared in-house, two types of curry powder and a sambal that alone, comprises of 8 ingredients. If you can handle spicy food, do yourself a favour and make this a must-try.  
Prawns doused in Chinese wine along with other traditional herbs, had a very \"clean\" soothing taste to it. Did not wow me but nevertheless still pretty decent. Secretly wished that the prawns were bigger though!
This is Diamond Kitchen\'s take on drunken prawns and it paid off really well. The prawns are cooked in a bamboo pot where the hot rocks heat the broth to generate steam to cook them. The result is a prawn which is incredibly tasty from being infused with all the flavours of the broth. The prawns itself were fresh and juicy and left everyone wanting more!
Beautifully presented, this dish is sensual in sight, spectacle and smell. The live tiger prawns doused in Chinese wine, wolfberries and Chinese dang gui, were cooked/steamed in this wooden basket, filled with hot stone, allowing the prawns to absorb the essence of the wine and herbs. Cooked just right, with the right firmness and crunchiness, it\'s a pity that these prawns were small, as I would like more than just seconds. 😋
Live tiger prawns went for a sauna! Doused in potent Chinese wine, wolfberries and dang gui, the live prawns had successfully embraced the heat of hot stones in the bamboo basket. The result was a pot of beautiful reddish pink prawns with strong herbal-alcoholic aroma and taste. 
The smooth silky fried homemade bean curd went well with the light sweet pumpkin sauce. Doesn\'t overwhelm, good to have as a side dish!
It\'s easy to mistake the platter of Pumpkin Bean Curd for a sea of shimmering gold bars. The glorious sauce is a mighty combo of prawns, crabmeat, scallops plus both old and young pumpkins. Why two kinds of pumpkins you might ask? Well, I learned that the former gives rich sweetness while the latter, a gorgeous hue.\n<br />The beancurd, made in-house from scratch with unsweetened soya bean milk and eggs, is exceedingly smooth and soft. Love how it simply melted in my mouth.
The simplest dish are usually the hardest to do. This golden plate of goodness were all entirely made from scratch and drowned in pumpkin sauce made from both young and old pumpkin. Young for the amazing yellow golden colour, while the old for the subtle but beautiful sweetness. On top with bits of scallops, prawns and crabmeat for that nice texture and crunch, this dish harmonise each ingredient perfectly.  
Prawns are well marinated and fresh. The Chinese wine really brought out the mild sweetness of the tiger prawns and the wolfberries and dang gui lent an incredible depth of sweetness to it.
It felt like eating salted egg chicken nugget except that you could really taste the fresh chicken meat underneath that crispy golden skin! The salted egg taste was well balanced and it did not overwhelm me unlike some others that I had previously ate. Children who loves to nuggets would definitely love this! ($14/$21/$28)
I love eggs so this was a clear winner with bits of chicken egg, salted duck egg and century egg. The resulting stock was indeed superior, but what impressed me the most was the good quality wolfberries - it provided a welcomed burst of sweetness to the dish.
One of my favourites to order at Chinese restaurants. The broth was quite sweet and tasty, and the addition of chicken eggs, salted duck eggs and century eggs only made it taste even better. It was more like drinking a bowl of soup with spinach added, which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. 
Tender and chunky nuggets of chicken that are just a tad under seasoned to counter the heaviness of the delicious salted egg batter. Great dish to whet your appetite!
Two of my favourite things put together equals to best night ever. Although the chicken was generously slathered in the salted egg sauce, it remained crispy and crunchy. The chicken chunks were super tender and juicy. Another great dish to try here!
Didn\'t have high hopes for this one initially because I have little to no love for chicken and thought this would be just another lacklustre rendition. How wrong I was! One bite into these and I was sold. There was a perfect harmony between the punchy salted egg yolk flavours and the crispy, yet tender chicken chunks, and the two truly became one. A must-order here if you like all things salted egg. Reasonably priced at $14/21/28 for various sizes.
What a clever idea - incorporating the salted egg into the batter itself. So each piece of the boneless chicken  is coated in an aromatic, savoury crunchiness. 
This will always be a regular feature in my diamond kitchen visits. It\'s light and flavorful without being filing. A party favorite, loved by both young and old. 
First dish of the meal set and I went totally out of control for this one. Those boneless ribs that were coasted with this not so sweet but savory champagne sauce was just too yummy for a hungry me. Dipped in Diamond kitchen\'s homemade belachan had further increased the kick for this dish. The mixture of the sweet juices and spicy chili for every bite just kept me wanting them more and more! Priced at $14/$21/$28, these pork ribs are of real quality that one wouldn\'t mind spending for! 
This was a good savoury dish featuring tender and flavourful boneless pork rib meat. The first dish to be served, this made us drool over what was to come next!
The only thing better than pork ribs are BONELESS pork ribs, so this was really a treat. The meat was really tender and well-marinated. It was glazed in a delicious champagne sauce that was similar to the normal tomato-BBQ sauce without the excessive saltiness or sourness. A nice start to the meal!
Look at this whole pot of goodness. High in vitamin B,D, iron, choline... You get the point. Other than it being healthy, it\'s cooked in the master chef\'s special stock that is continuously brewed, which makes it really tasty as well! 
because black pepper is too mainstream. big juicy fresh sri lankan crab is a given in diamond kitchen but their 干香 (gan xiang) crab literally turns up the heat with a fiery spice paste concoction of over 20 undisclosed ingredients. hearsay fermented soya bean paste, 2 types of curry powder and their current 5th gen sambal are in the list but the rest are sworn to secrecy. if you fancy your crab spicy, you\'re in for a treat - know that this is not your one dimensional pedestrian spiciness, this spiciness has depth man i tell you. i know cause i sweated it out trying.
someone wiser once established the law of diminishing value? i dunno man, i think thats load full of \"crab\". i mean have they even try the crabs here? the salted egg yolk crabs here are like the diamond of all crabs. anyway, that law has no power here. period.
I don\'t usually eat fish skin due to the texture, but this was fantastic with a gelatinous, buttery feel.
Each Scottish bamboo clam is steamed with glass noodles, enoki mushroom and water chestnut that adds a surprising element of sweetness and crunch, best savored with heaps of crispy fried garlic—it\'s so good you\'ll never have enough.
It’s all about the sauce when it comes to crabs and this gan xiang sauce – an intriguing mix of sambal, bean paste and curry powder – was ridiculously fragrant and addictive (the kind of substance one could just spoon or be consumed with rice and mantous alone and yet be immensely satisfying). One thing though – given all the spices at play my tongue was craving and almost expecting a good spicy kick in the pants, but alas such a kick never did come. 3.7/5
A dish that is worth dirtying my fingers for! 😁😋 Literally licked clean everything too. 🙊🙈 FYI, fans of @diamondkitchensg, they have a second outlet at Science Park, which is much bigger! Don\'t need to reserve 4 weeks in advance now~ 😌👌🏻#diamond kitchen #diamondkitchensg
Not sure what aquatic kinfolk eat in Hong Kong waters but aside from being giant, the grouper tasted remarkably meatier and chewier than its brethren elsewhere. The skin itself should have its own Kinohimitsu endorsement deal – your face would in all likelihood have the smooth texture of a fluffy pau after a few bites of this gelatinous elixir. 3.8/5
Glorious chunks of crab that\'s been fried with spices. A little on the spicy side, the sauce is finger licking delicous. A great dish to end my day packed with good food &amp; company. Thanks for the invite @rachelxie. (๑¯◡¯๑)
Mad love the flavorful broth and succulent lobster. Besides the signature gan xiang crab, this is also featured in the set meal that is going at $88++ per pax at Sciene Park branch. It is available from now till end July. More details on web, jacqsowhat.com (link in bio)
You can opt to have your favourite part of the grouper cooked one of two ways – either Hong Kong steamed or Garlic Stewed. Hong Kong Steamed Grouper features a sweet-savoury gravy brewed with top-grade soya sauce and is best paired with the grouper belly, which has a firm, meaty bite. 
While there were disappointingly no kilts in sight, the Scottish clams were soft and chewy with only the faintest of that distinctive and sometimes divisive clammy taste, as the salty and fragrant crispy garlic commanded the room. I thought the little discs at the bottom were garlic, so it was a pleasant surprise when my mouth realised that they were crunchy water chestnuts! 4/5
The iconic Gan Xiang Crab from the local seafood specialist Diamond Kitchen who has been satisfying the palates of many crustacean lovers with its myriad of skilfully prepared live seafood dishes and comforting home-style Chinese fare since 2013.
Essentially a most tenacious giant prawn sitting in a light and comforting broth. The lobster, easily extracted from the remnants of its former home, tasted like it must have been an athletic man who had a well-nourished life. 4/5
Shaved Lime and Honey Ice was a pretty balance of sweet and sour; somewhat replicating Calamansi, while the Lemongrass Jelly sits in Lemongrass water which compliments each other nicely. A great dessert to freshen up after a heavy meal.
This is the Diamond Gan Xiang Crab - Sri Lankan crab wok-fried with spices. Boy looks pissed and crabby - you can see it in his eyes.
Sri Lankan Crabs that are around 1.5kg are usually used in this dish, but the one we got were slightly smaller due to the restaurant rejecting a shipment of crabs a few days ago as it did not meet their standards. Unique to Diamond Kitchen, the Gan Xiang recipe is a well kept secret only few would know. A crossover between black pepper sauce with hints of curry flavour, the Gan Xiang literally translates into dry fragrance when the aroma wafted into the room when it made its entrance. Meat was succulent, and it was definitely a delight with that mild spicy flavour!
Sweet Potato leaves cooked with garlic and pork lard and chili padi. Innocent it may seem, but we love that hidden factor of spiciness within the dish, which was of mild level. Salted Fish was pretty flavourful, but my favourite had to be the crispy pork lard that was oh so crisp and sinful! The leaves were also thankfully not too stiff, and were easily chewable. Apparently this felt like a very classy and upscale version of Sambal Kang Kong, which is also one of my favourite tzechar dishes of all time too!
Local lobsters are used here in Diamond Kitchen\'s Lobster Porridge, which are steamed once before being cooked into the porridge. Unlike the usual Teochew or Cantonese cooking style, the version here is done \"pao fan\" style, which sees the rice grains soaked in a chicken stock spiked with ginger and Chinese Wine. Lobster was fresh and came off from the shell pretty easily, with a pull of the fork and knife slit in between the meat and shell.
Claypot-braised Giant Grouper with house stock and garlic. Typically the fin is used for this cooking method as it could retain its firmness after being simmered, though our portion had parts of fish head included. The stock is a more premium and subtle version of Claypot Tofu, and the fish was succulent. Garlic flavour was evident, which enhanced the fragrance of this dish.
Typically we were told that 18 to 20kg groupers are used for this dish, and the best part to go with this cooking style would be the belly. Simmered with Hong Kong steamed sauce brewed with top grade soya sauce, I loved how the fish itself was rather meaty and rather springy without any hint of fishiness instead of the usual fish that is rather soft. The accompanying sauce was savoury and definitely suits my tastebuds; I am just a sucker for Hong Kong style soy sauce. Thinly-sliced ginger is included so it gives a tingle to the tastebuds. Apparently there are only two places in Singapore which serve Giant Grouper; one of which is Diamond Kitchen so you know where to go if you are craving for one ;)
Scottish Bamboo Clam cooked in Bamboo with glass noodles, enoki mushrooms and water chestnuts simmered with a home-brewed Hong Kong steamed soy sauce. The clams were really succulent, absorbing the flavour from the Hong Kong soy sauce which was savoury. Crispy fried garlic added a pungent yet heaty flavour which enhances the clam, while the glass noodles were really slippery and well flavoured by the Hong Kong steamed sauce. Water Chestnuts adds a crunchy texture to the dish.
A cold dish with celery, carrot, black fungus, red chili, poached chicken, abalone tossed together with sesame oil. Love that fragrance of sesame oil that exudes in every part of the dish from the crunchy vegetables to the shredded chicken and the \"q\" abalone which was not a single bit rubbery. The sesame oil also helped remove much of the sharp flavours of the celery, making it a lot bearable to have!
Heartwarmingly comforting is this lobster porridge at Diamond Kitchen\'s new sister establishment at Science Park, part of its Diamond Seafood Signatures Set ($88 per person; min. four to order), available now till Jul 31.
this was pretty good, generous with ingredients too ($5, no ++ for take aways)
Lobsters are steamed and halved then added into a pot of rice simmered in chicken stock spiked with Chinese wine and sliced ginger. Now it\'s available in a 7-course dinner at S$88++ per pax (min. 4 person)! #太划算了吧 💅🏼: @sophiensyy
I\'m one, so it was a great treat. the bamboo clams were of sizable portion coupled with the garlic and greens made for a good entree.
Steamed local lobsters are added to a pot of rice, simmered with chicken stock and spiked with Chinese wine and sliced ginger. Very comforting indeed!
Mid-day indulgence at Diamond Kitchen latest venture in the West, featuring the luxurious Lobster Porridge which is one of their promotional signatures, including the 7-course menu ($88++ per person) are now available exclusively at the Oasis till end of July 2015.
Fragrant, rich and spicy curry with tender pork slices. One of the spicy one I can find in town. Rice was a little too hard for me.
We had a 7-course dinner at S$88++ per pax (min. 4 person), this is my favourite [Garlic Steamed Bamboo Clams] - tender, chewy bamboo clam morsels, lathered in special stock garnished with vermicelli noodles and garlic crackle.
Lobster porridge, one of the item for the 7 course meal at Diamond Kitchen at a promotion price $88++ per pax. Mad love the generous portion of succulent lobster meat 😛
Here are some of the delicious items you can enjoy at the new #DiamondKitchen at Science Park Drive, and at a great price of $88 only for 7-courses. Offer avail. till end Jul!
We figured we should have something that wasn\'t deep fried, hence this order. ❤️ the eggy tofu that was super smooth, lots of ingredients stuffed in the plate but the dish could use more sauce, it was good, but there was too little of it ($14++)
Quite literally the best rendition of this dish. Crisp, light batter that didn\'t feel oily. Sotong cooked just right &amp; was very fresh, springy &amp; had a sweetness that came through the batter &amp; salted egg yolk sauce. Also love that the salted egg sauce was the drier kind so the batter stayed crisp throughout the meal. An addictive dish for sure. ($14++)
Bite sized chicken thigh, fried &amp; tossed in cereal. Liked that the meat was well marinated. ($14++)
Glad I\'m here at one of my favourite Chinese restaurants of all time for a seafood feast – definitely in need of some soul-warming comfort food now.
Would someone please bring me some of this crazily comforting lobster porridge? The combination of that succulent steamed lobster with rice swimming in the chef\'s special chicken broth – food for the soul, indeed.
Finally made an appearance in the gym after one month of MIA. My arms are feeling as jellyish as this dessert. 😅 As a matter of fact, I\'m really lemming for something as refreshing as this: a mountain of finely crushed lime-and-honey ice planted on an island of lemongrass jelly, in a pool of lemongrass water.
It\'s really tasty! Service here is awesome too. \n<br />#food #foodporn #burpple #yummy #singapore #sciencepark #family #familyday #familylife #familylove #familyfood #familyovereverything #appreciate #感恩
