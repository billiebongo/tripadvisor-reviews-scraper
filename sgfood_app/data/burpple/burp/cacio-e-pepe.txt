Hot chocolate that melts like lava. Not overly sweet. Best eaten hot! 
Creamy rich mushroom bisque @ $10. Rather big portion! 
The decor is homey, the atmosphere is warm and the service is friendly. The boss is very friendly and it makes us feel like we are having dinner at a friendâ€™s house.

A hidden gem with a loyal following, Cacio e Pepe serves good quality Italian food minus the pretense. Enjoy a lovely meal with your date in this cosy neighborhood joint, without having to venture into the crowds. Start with the portobellos, and try either the tagliatelle with scallop in truffle cream sauce, or the squid ink risotto. While pasta may not seem deserving of a $20+ price tag, these are very good, and are more worth it than the pizzas here. Finish off with the oozing chocolate lava cake, and leave this gem with a smile on your face.
