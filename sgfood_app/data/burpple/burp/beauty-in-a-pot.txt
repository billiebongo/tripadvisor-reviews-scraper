My sis @c2rpediem choose the venue this time round and we had it at her new addiction steamboat restaurant -  Beauty in A Pot @ ONE KM Mall! Collagen soup super flavoring and fragrant, Service was very good too with staff serving you from time to time.. Helping you to throw your dishes into the soup base, they even help u to refill the soft drinks from the can into your glasses when it\'s running low! How detailed and attentive are they! Great atmosphere, great food, great service! AWESOME! We will definitely return again some day! Fyi, Beauty in a pot is under my favourite group, Paradise Group!! How coincidence is that! @phusionade @paradisegrpsg #paradisegroup #beautyinapot #onekmmall #onekm #motherday2016
Could just keep drinking bowls of this soup! 
Comfort yourself during the extreme weather change with awesome ingredients such as the Beancurd skin ($9) or the surprisingly sweet corn! Other favourites includes the tender pork collar, bouncy squid balls and the must order of ebiko prawn paste (!!).
Not a huge fan of bean curd but this was really good especially soaking all that collagen from the creamy flavourful 12-hour shark cartilage soup!
Highly anticipated steamboat dinner with fellow tastemakers and gosh, it sure was worth the wait. 
Like this steamboat, nice food and good service! Find it better than Haidilao. 
The calm before the storm because it all went downhill from here onwards. Ok, that\'s all.
However, be forewarned of the smell that accompanies the soup- it distinctly smells of animal origin. Same goes with their signature fish paste seen here- it\'s an acquired taste. And pricey too; I dare say HDL is cheaper, yes!
I love this place but somehow, this evening\'s broth didn\'t taste as rich as the one I had just before CNY. Hope it\'s just a fluke. #hotpot #sgfood #burpple
My favorite ingredient from Beauty in a Pot — Prawn paste with those crunch ebiko bits!! The tip is to press in the bits into the paste first before cooking so that the bits will not end up floating in the soup instead! Not forgetting the Beauty Collagen Broth ($20 per pot) made with shark\'s cartilage, the richness and creaminess had us having multiple bowls of soup till we were so stuffed! For dinner reservations, you need to make them at least 2 weeks in advance. With the soup this good, it\'s not surprising! 
My title said it all 🙌🏻 The soup was so good that we must have refilled it a gazillion time. The fried bean curd skin roll is my favorite item, jus 3 secs to be perfectly melting in your mouth. N E E D TO G O AGAIN! 
Collagen based steamboat with fresh ingredients! The soup base was really fragrant and good on its own. Wished there was more variety in the menu though. Would recommend to try the live drunken prawns and handmade fishballs, something different from the ordinary steamboat places.
Service not as good as hai di lao, the staffs were too busy today. Overall, the soup n the food is not bad. Always long queue, better make a reservation before you go. 
Beauty in the Pot, the latest restaurant concept by Paradise Group. And it\'s surprisingly good! \n<br />We ordered their signature collagen soup base (S$20+), which is said to be boiled from shark cartilage. Really love this broth and I think it makes a great steamboat soup base! \n<br />One of their key highlights here is their various seafood paste. It comes in a bowl and their staff will assist to scoop the paste into the soup.
I like how they mould the fish paste into a fish shape. Extra points for effort
The hotpot set comes along with 4 bottles of additional collagen to top up when it\'s running low!
Opted for both flavours cos why not? The shark cartilage soup nourished and increased my collagen level to maximum!
After having this for the first time, I have totally fall in love with it. One of the best steamboat with awesome soup base. Never forgetting the collagen in the pot is good for you. Wide variety range of food. One of my favorite is the bean curd skin. Best way to eat is to dip the bean curd skin into the hot soup less than 3secs and eat it before it turns sogy. The fish tofu taste awesome too! Go after 9pm if you don\'t want to queue for long. It close at 1pm on the weekdays and 3pm on the weekends.
Was an avid fan of HDL, visits at least 8 times a month, and there was once, 3 times in a day. Have thousands of HDL points and was already a fan even before they introduced the points system. Beauty in the pot surely had a lot to offer in order to make me completely stop visiting HDL and turned to its fan. Their broth is amazing, and I meant both. There are only two broths available but it is good enough to win my heart, cause both of them are the best steamboat broth I have tried everywhere. For a steamboat place to win anybody\'s heart, you need freshest ingredients, good service, reasonable pricing, and delicious broth; Welcome to Beauty in the Pot. Few must-order items are: shrimp paste, wagyu beef, la mien, corn, fried beancurd roll, and, wild bamboo(zhu sheng). Please try both their soup broth!
Collagen broth was satisfying, comfort food indeed but definitely not my best place for steamboat 🍲
PS: The late Mr. Lee sure had a wicked sense of humour. I can\'t look at steamboat the same way again. hahaha. #uniquelysingapore
One word - Disappointment! Came one evening with high expectation after friends telling and urging me to try this new place. In comparison to 海底撈 is like comparing a kid to his dad. The range of sauce is an utter disappointment. I don\'t see the difference between Beauty In A Pot with 刷一刷, except for a much nicely decorated ambience. I can get all that plus better choice, food and service at HDL. I can\'t believed that they don\'t even have a raw egg on sale!!!! I won\'t put my money else where when it comes to opting for a hotpot dinner next time. Verdict: 2/5
Not bad at all! Cheaper than Hai Di Lao with better broth, worth a try
Rolled so they look kinda like coronets, these fried beancurd skins are a specialty here at Beauty in the Pot. They\'re best dunked into the hotpot for three seconds to achieve the right balance of crunch and sogginess.
Because one round of dinner wasn\'t enough (actually it was, but we\'re greedy), we headed to have some late-night steamboat.
I am really the spontaneous \"Let\'s Go!\" kind of person. Thus, I will go sometimes anywhere for food.
#notachemistrylab Received attentive service here and they open till 3am on Fri, Sat and eve of PH! Forget milk, hotpot is the cure for insomnia. #collagenhotpot #beautyinthepot #instafood #foodstagram #burpple
You will not go hungry looking for supper places as this beauty hotpot spot is open till 1am all days and extended up to 3am on Fridays and Saturday. Currently having 20% off (30% OCBC &amp; PGR members) total food bill after 10pm. If you\'re wondering, this is Ebiko Prawn Paste, one of the must-order items here.
Dense and milky Beauty Collagen broth made from shark\'s cartilage, and enhanced with luxurious Chinese herbs. Something which stands out from the other restaurants serving collagen hotpot. Not sure if the hype for collagen hotpot is over, but who cares I just want some homemade beauty to nourish my body and soul. 
Finally tried Beauty in the pot with da family yesterday! Had the twin flavours pot - Beauty Collagen Soup / Spicy Nourishing Soup.\n<br />↭ Beauty Collagen Soup // 胶原蛋白养颜美容锅 - Rich, dense, milky collagen broth prepared daily. Boiled for more than 8 hours using shark\'s cartilage.\n<br />↭ Spicy Nourishing Soup // 滋补养生香辣锅 - Pork bone broth with Chinese herbs (red dates,wolfberries, ginseng, danggui, dangshen) &amp; Sichuan chilli oil. Available in 3 levels of spiciness (mild-spicy, spicy, extra spicy).\n<br />Can\'t decide which broth is better as I like both! The collagen broth is flavorful &amp; comforting. The spicy nourishing broth is very spicy &amp; I like the burning sensation when the soup slides down my throat. Damn shiok!!
Looks very spicy 😈 but not. I drank the soup and it\'s very sweet and Flavorful 👌 🐻❤️❤️it didn\'t even trigger my gastric pain👍 quite fun to look at the oil being put away while waiting 🐻🐾 @paradisegrpsg
Yuzu Freeze 👌👍🐻❤️🐾❄️❄️❄️ very refreshing. Love the presentation in a box of ice to keep the Freeze cold
Made fresh daily from Yellowtail fish, Soya Bean and Egg. $1.80 per piece.
The spicy soup base is very good too! Look at the herbs and Ginseng inside the soup 😋💦👏🐾🐻
Chinese food is akin to an art form - you mould the pieces with your fingers. Beauty in a pot has the finest artists moulding our food, the skin was so even and didn\'t break apart despite swimming in the pot for really long!
The meatballs and fish balls are handmade! Really soft and squishy
Place this homemade fish tofu in the non-spicy beauty collagen broth for about 10 minutes! Wonderfully tasty and silken, and it\'s natural sweetness from the fish is similar to that of white chocolate. Tender and delicate!
Strong enough to numb your tongue. Made from pork bones with Szechuan Chilli oil, the soup uses natural flavors from red dates, wolfberries, ginseng and danggui. You can select mildly spicy, spicy or extra spicy broth!
Both the spicy nourishing broth &amp; the beauty collagen broth are good!! 😋😋
Carry on from my previous review - Get this!
I would say drunken chicken and collagen will be my fav from now. #paradisegrpsg
I deserve to win the contest 😪😂🤣 #paradisegrpsg
The beauty collagen broth comprises of shark\'s cartilage as their main ingredient, the broth itself is rich and flavourful but not all might like it due to the oily texture when u drink it.
Probably with their new outlet now in Centerpoint, crowd has flocked there?

This was a great meal (maybe because I wasn\'t the one paying for it hehe). The soup base was amazing!! I would really give the Tom yum soup a miss though, just the normal collagen soup is enough. Really the best Hotpot soup base I have tasted!! The best dish was the drunken prawns which were still alive and kicking when they arrived at the table. A great meal :-) 
Definitely my favourite hotpot from now on 😋

Look at how creamy white the shark cartilage broth was and we were blown away right from our first sip !

I always like dining with my family. The one thing I hate is I can\'t find good angle to take my food pics cos they all can\'t wait to dig in 😂😂😂. On a side note, I\'ve added this to my list of favorite hot pot restaurants. The broth is very tasty and the service is exceptional! Kudos! 🙆🙆🙆\n<br />.
Most importantly, there\'s no gamey smell at all. This meh meh is sooooo chewy! #paradisegroupsg #chinesecuisine

BEAUTY in the pot 🐻💦 (restaurant captain slicing the scallop paste and put into the dual soup broth) ❤️ @paradisegrpsg
BEAUTY in the pot 😁👍 ( Restaurant Captain slicing the scallop paste and put into dual soup broth hotpot) @paradisegrpsg 🐻❤️🐾
Just dip for 3 secs. It\'s crispy and soft. Very unique texture. Recommended MUST try 🐾👌
Very nice fruit aroma 🍎🍊🍐🐻❤️🐾
So yummy recommended dipping sauce Thai Tom Yum sauce. 👍❤️
Soak in wine and eventually got drunk before its put into the beauty pot
Refillable and refreshing pot of tea
It\'s a similar concept to #Haidilao. However, it only has 2 soup base to choose from. \n<br />The range of food is about the same but the #service is #fabulous. Great place for #gathering with #friends.
