Thin slices of wagyu beef stir fried with an assortment of mushrooms. The beef was well-marinated, quite tender, and went really well with the mushrooms. The fried garlic bits added a bit more flavour to the dish and balanced out the saltiness of the sauce. Another dish that you should try from their buffet!
The best way to gauge how good a Japanese restaurant is to judge it by the standards of its sashimi. And Hokkaido is a downright decent Japanese establishment.
A deceptively simple stir-fry of Australian Wagyu marinated in an addictive tare sauce, mushrooms &amp; caramelised onions, topped with fragrant garlic, but it was oh-so-good. We asked for seconds despite the deluge of food, and even then, I secretly wished I had an entire plate to myself. #NeedToMaintain
\'Cos what\'s a Japanese buffet without some sushi rolls? The eponymous Hokkaido Maki was tasty enough; its fail-proof combination of salmon, ebiko and mayo was accentuated with hints of smoky bonito. Oishi!
Even if you\'re meh about chawanmushi, the generous portion of salmon roe should more than entice you to have a few of these to yourself. The roe pops satisfying in your mouth with each bite, giving the egg custard a more salty and savoury flavour. Much recommended as an excellent way to get your meal started. 
✨😍✨ was how most our faces looked when these cups full of gems arrived on our table! Loved shoveling these into my mouth and feeling each one popping away! \n<br />#TheHokkaidoBuffetExperenice featured super fresh seafood air flown in from Japan. 
Who knew that century egg sauce (deliciously pungent), draped languidly over creamy silken tofu could be this sexy? Which begs the next question: Could pitan very well become the next IT ingredient? 🤔

🐟🐠🐙 Really delighted by how fresh the sashimi was! Especially the hamachi sashimi. Was never a fan of hamachi before this. ☺️😋👍🏻 .\n<br />.\n<br />Guess what? You can find all this FREE FLOW on @hokkaidosushi_sg\'s The Hokkaido Buffet Experience! $38++ for lunch, $43++ for dinner! Just eat all the sashimi!! 😍😍👌🏻
Impressed with the quality and presentation of the food. The buffet is worth the money. Will come back again. 
of buffet is ($48++) .\n<br />Other than the sashimi 刺身, I think it\'s difficult to have a decent jap meal in buffet style esp. Not to say it wasn\'t good but it\'s hard to have so many things on the menu and expect it to be all good haha
Fresh thick cubes of sashimi. The set menu was great! An affordable $25 for this rice bowl, salad, miso soup and fruits.
100g of the most melt in your mouth ohmi wagyu sirloin with uber fragrant beef trimming fried rice. This is really 😭😭😭 So so so sinful but so good worth every last calorie 👍👍👍
Executive Chef Thomas Kok prides his food on the use of fresh quality ingredients along with skillful technique and creative flair in executing his cooking.

Amazing sushi and sashimi! Fresh and handmade on the spot😄 I love the torched aburi salmon, and the scallop sashimi(on the house) was succulent and sweet. The spicy aburi hemachi was not bad as well👍 Affordable ala carte buffet with fantastic sushi and sashimi😌
Each buffet diner will get a slice of tuna, chutoro, otoro and hotate and salmon belly.  They forgot to serve us during our family meal.  So my hubby and I returned specially for this and we ate on behalf of everybody whahahaha ♡. Kudos for great service, awesome food and value-for-money buffet ♡  Thanks Hokkaido Sushi!

With Otoro (extra fatty tuna), Chutoro (fatty tuna), Akami (Lean Tuna) and Negitoro on the plate, we can fully relish in the superbly marbled fatty Bluefin tuna. I preferred the Otoro for its juicy oiliness while my hubby preferred the Chutoro which had a good balance of fats and lean meat.

At this very moment.
Can never resist the flavours of this decadent seafood especially this fresh from Hokkaido Sushi, every mouthful makes me smile. \n<br />Gastronometer: 9.5/10\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#singapore #nomnom #instafood_sg #foodlover #foodstagram #foodphoto #sgfood #foodie #instasg #instagood #igsg #f52grams #sashimi #gastronomysg #igfood #cafesg #foodart #foodphotography #igdaily #foodblog #instafood #yummy #photooftheday #igers #igasia #food #foodporn #foodgasm #burpple #uni
The torching of the scallop enhanced the whole parcel with an extra smoky flavour on top of the sweetness for a full flavoured enjoyment. Another worthy note is the use of organic high grade Japanese Nanatsubosh rice for their delectable sushi. It is only one of a select few Japanese restaurants in Singapore who serve such premium rice.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #sushi #scallop #japanese #japanesefood

One of the best Japanese buffet I ever tried because of their fresh and premium food quality!

Aburi salmon mentaiko is a must try too!\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @hokkaidosushi_sg and @weeatfish for the invite! ☝🏻️😋\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #hokkaidosushirestaurant
Their fish and seafood are air flown in straight from Tsukiji and Sapporo, Japan, twice a week! Had tried their sashimi which is so fresh and juicy! My Favourite is their Scallops!!!\n<br />.\n<br />Other recommendations are their Pitan Tofu (century egg), Ikura Chawanmushi and must try Aburi Salmon Mentaiko which we had a 2nd serving even though we are so full at the end.\n<br />.\n<br />Lunch $38++ (U.P $48++)\n<br />Dinner $43++ (U.P $55++)\n<br />.\n<br />Location: M Hotel Singapore, Level 9, 81 Anson Road, Singapore 079908\n<br />.\n<br />#hokkaidosushi #thehokkaidobuffetexperience #sgbuffet #japanesebuffet #sghotel #hotelfood #burpple #burpplesg

However it needs a bit more seasoning to justify for the excellent execution.
The white fish, lightly salt grilled needed a heavier hand in seasoning for me as the fish itself was rather bland unlike cod fish which has a natural buttery taste.
The creamy steamed egg custard topped with salmon roe will delight both the young and old.
The pork and ginger is screaming for a bowl of rice to go with it. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #hokkaidosushisg #pork #japanese #japanesefood
Glad to have them all these years. 💕
The sweetness of the prawn wrapped in a light tempura batter is really value for money. Imagine you get free flow if you opt of the buffet. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #hokkaidosushisg #tempura #japanese #japanesefood
The silken tofu is drenched in a savoury century egg dressing, topped wtih surimi and spring onions. The century egg dressing complemented the tofu excellently. No wonder it is a crowd favourite.
It comes with an enjoyable popping bites with lovely flavours.
Usual price is $48++ and $55++ respectively. Guests will also get a complimentary Seafood Platter for every diner to start with, limited to one per pax. On the plate there is botan ebi, salmon and truffle hamachi.
The new buffet menu includes most of their signature dishes at a single price, allowing guests to taste their specialties at a reasonable price.
Sufficient to fill in the remaining gaps in the gut without provision of gratification of any permissible sort
The salmon mentaiko aburi is a particular standout, as is the eclectic spicy tuna which works more than it should on paper, the key is the well constructed mini rice sculptures that are layered in a delicious mixture of classic tradition and clever modernisation that will both surprise and delight your culinary senses. \n<br />Best thing is, you can keep getting seconds and with its anchor in it\'s fine selection of jap rice and immaculate construction, trust me you will want more :)\n<br />#sushi #aburi #salmon #mentaiko #hokkaidosushi #foodporn #sgfood #burpple #japanesebuffet
Everything just seems more palatable when the mood is relaxed as we welcome the precious weekend! Tuck in to some freshly prepared indulgence, sushi time!
It is possible to surmise that this is the end of your epicurean journey at Hokkaido Sushi unless you\'re willing to invest additional tummy real estate on mediocre Japanese dishes that are better off taking residence in the local hawker center
you rarely will find such freshness of these raw fishes during a buffet.\n<br />•\n<br />thinking about dinner now?\n<br />•
😋 Love the teriyaki chicken and pidan tofu best!👍🏻
This particular day\'s Japan air flown prawn was succulent sweet and ocean fresh that\'s almost as good as eating it there :)))))\n<br />#hokkaidosushi #sashimi #japanesebuffet #sgbuffet #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodporn #burpple
Think unlimited serving of sushi like mentai aburi sushi!😱😍
The unfortunate case of cooked food mostly leaning towards the overcooked and bland side of life, is more Chinese style than Japanese
Considering its part of a buffet menu and you can have more than one :)\n<br />#chawanmushilover #yuzu #ikura #hokkaidosushi #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Impressed with the freshness of the sashimi, especially enjoyed the swordfish, yellowtail, prawn, salmon belly and scallops. \n<br />Definitely recommend to go with their buffet which is only at $38++ for lunch, $48++ for dinner.
