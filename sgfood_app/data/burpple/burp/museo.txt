Oh my marbling! Blackmore 9+ Wagyu Sirloin, Saut√©ed Portobello, Herb Salad.
Steaks are reasonably priced &amp; nicely done. They have a variety of choices for condiments too. @ Skirt #food #restaurant #singapore
Huge scallops for starters! Very juicy and tasty. Very good steaks as well. Good choice for my boy\'s birthday dinner. Had a hard time getting a cab out though, so will definitely have to drive when I go back. 
Top marked dessert! Read why:http://www.epinosh.com/skirt-w-singapore-sentosa-cove-singapore/
Omitting the goat cheese, be mindful if u didn\'t like earthy flavor. 
$54/250g, this was too rich and the marbling was less even, I would definitely pay extra for a piece of Tajima again on my next visit.
A reasonable 250g for a prized cut that was aged dry in the house, tendered and evenly marbled with brilliant crisp at some ends! Without condiments and salts, the piece was truly amazing on its own for a reasonable $70/250g. Read more: http://www.epinosh.com/skirt-w-singapore-sentosa-cove-singapore/
Too thick in texture and excessively buttery.. Weigh me down totally

Hehe... the palate cleanser and BBQ sauce....
I am not a huge steak lover, but this steak may jolly well have converted me. Using parilla grill, the steak had a smoky charred taste which I thoroughly enjoyed. What I didn\'t like so much was how rare the middle of the steak was. I requested for the steak to be made medium, but certain areas looked and tasted medium rare, however it was still delicious. Even the slightly more well done edges were juicy and tender. Going at about $65++, this steak was very worth it and it also looked much more than the 200g it was supposed to be. Definitely highly recommended. Boyfriend had a ribeye steak and although very delicious as well, he said he would order this skirt steak the next time we come. .\n<br />#sgfoodies #sgfoodie #eatoutsg #sgrestaurant #instafood_sg #beef #steak #skirtsteak #whotel #ASandHP #birthday #burpple #foodporn #sgfoodporn #reversedieting #sgeats #whati8today

Good! 
The cheese was a tad OTT
Good recommendation! 
Sweet! Good on its own. Apple sauce didn\'t compliment. 
Very Asian... 
Fresh, quality cuisine at extremely decent prices. 
Cooked to perfection, a lovely shade of medium rare.:)
