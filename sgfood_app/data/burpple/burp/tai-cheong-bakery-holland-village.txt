$1.90\n<br />I\'ve posted a review on their egg tarts before but dang, this picture does so much more justice to their egg tarts so here\'s another review!
Didn\'t have much high hopes for this café since Tai Cheong is an egg tart place. However, was pleasantly surprised at how decent the rest of the dishes turned out as well! 
Egg and tart part is very soft. Tend to eat all over the place. A little too pricy for me.
I did a take away with very minimal quene. And i felt that it was over rated. The crust and tart is still nice but definitely not worth queuing for.The one from hk was way better. Also ordered a polo bun which tasted very normal.

Ok next time. We arrived when there was no one queuing. 10 mins after there was the queue for takeaway and also the dine-in. Phew.
Colleagues and I pretend it\'s already the weekend..... Thick Toast, Scramble Eggs and Spam Fries.😍
It still has one of the best egg custard and solid puff pastry crust around.
A little bit of an itchy mouth here because I went past Tai Cheong Bakery and there was no queue. Fought hard against the decision of buying an Egg Tart and settled for the Durian Cheese Tart that surprisingly didn\'t disappoint. The Durian lover in me especially loved how pungent the durian flavour was throughout the entire tart with a little flesh and fibre within the tart itself; while it strangely reminds me of a Durian Ambon in taste and the streaky lines within when one chews into it. Its a little greasy but I am fine with it though. Not sure how those whom are expecting a cheese tart would feel though, but certainly something for durian lovers to go for.
Hong Kong milk tea &amp; coffee mix (2.50), scrambled eggs toast (6.50), three egg macaroni soup with luncheon meat (8.50), Polo Bun (2.20), Egg tart (1.90), Durian &amp; cheese tart (3.60)
$9.50\n<br />Scrambled Eggs with Chicken was a dish recommended to me by my sister and I have to say, it didn\'t disappoint. The scrambled eggs were silky and soft, and one of the best scrambled eggs I\'ve had. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. However, once the chicken cooled down, it became quite tough so I do recommend eating the chicken quickly while it\'s still hot! The thick toast was soft on the inside and rather crispy on the outside. There\'s also a teensy bit of cream sauce with mushroom at the bottom of the plate which i enjoyed eating with my scrambled eggs. As an avid fan of Hong Kong food, I really enjoyed the food and the service her and I will definitely be back for more!
$4.70\n<br />The cold milk tea ($2.80) was just average as I personally prefer my milk tea to be a little sweeter but I have to admit, the egg tart is to die for. The egg tart ($1.90) came to my table and a bite into this egg tart sent me to heaven. The egg was the texture of pudding and the puff pastry was hot and soft, just the way I liked it. One of the best egg tarts I have ever had, in fact it was so good I couldn\'t resist buying 4 more egg tarts home. The staff was super friendly and I had such a pleasant experience here!
Curry beef brisket with a local twist. Thumbs up for the attentive service. Request for extra gravy comes in extra bowl leh! Beat that! Don\'t forget to pack the famous egg tarts home too. It\'s a must!
Power up your midweek with this plate of fluffy scrambled eggs on toast with yuan yang! The eggs were really silky and smooth and indeed living up to its standard! 👍
Rice topped with silky egggggg and pork and beef! Simple dish executed well at a reasonable price. Would be back for this
Fluffy toast topped with egg but not too impressive considering the price and the lack of spam of spam fries 😐 would rather chomp down more of their egg tarts
Tai Cheong\'s egg tarts - The surface was slightly firm yet bouncy, but when you bite into them, the soft egg custard breaks apart almost instantly. 
Besides serving the famous Egg Tart from Hong Kong, Tai Cheong Bakery also serves other popular snacks from Hong Kong such as Bolo Bun and Chicken Pie. There are various Hong Kong meals such as Macaroni Soup with Shredded Chicken and Scrambled Egg Toast Stack, not forgetting the Durian &amp; Cheese Tart that is especially created for Singaporeans. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
to me, only the egg tart is worth trying :( tried the silky egg rice, tomato macaroni and curry beef brisket too. the mains are damn meh :/
Chill Sunday brunch w @timchee . Scrambled eggs was buttery and smooth and great on the slightly crisp fluffy toast! As for the chicken cutlet, I prob should have gone w/o it. It\'s pre-fried and dry to the core. The flavour comes from the salt crystals on the exterior... 🤷🏻‍♀️ On the other hand their beef brisket curry rice was surprisingly good! Thick creamy red curry (it\'s just slightly spicy and taste tomato-y) w tender beef brisket! 🤤I also tried the durian cheese tart, but their egg tarts are still the best. #burpple #taicheong #chachaanteng #hkstyle
Buttery, crumbly tart pastry shell, with a soft, wobbly, eggy custard.
😉😋 Zero queue!! Woohoo!! (ps: the kitchen is experiencing some issues today, so sit-down section is closed for the time being, only takeaway available).
Super yummy egg tarts! Got recommended by a Friend. Located at Tai Cheong Bakery within Holland Village, these tarts are a steal! 
Egg Tart (S$1.90)\n<br />Limited to 2 pieces per dine in customer.\n<br />Buttery and crumbly. I think 💭 it\'s the best item out of the whole menu.\n<br />|\n<br />Tai Cheong Bakery \n<br />Address 🏠 : 31 Lorong Liput, Singapore 🇸🇬 277 742\n<br />Tel ☎ : \n<br />Open 💈 : \n<br />Mon - Fri : 10am - 10pm\n<br />Sat, Sun &amp; Eve of PH : 9am - 10pm\n<br />Main dishes served : 11am - 2.30pm, 5.30pm - 9.30pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Holland Village (CC21)
having bought this many many times, i concluded that the egg tarts sold at taka is definitely fresher and tastier compared to this... but i guess understandably so since they only do egg tarts where as the outlet at hv offers a wider variety of food items and even drinks! i ordered ice yuan yang and chubby ordered this strange ginger lemon coke hot drink?? the ice yuan yang was subpar (maybe i got too used to the real deal in hk itself) whereas chubby\'s drink was surprisingly nice!! such a dear this boy, he automatically swap our drink orders cos i said i regretted mine and i also have a terrible cough so really shouldn\'t be drinking cold drinks hahah and he doesn\'t even like coffee!! 😅 nice ambience tho very very limited seats/ i recall it being packed during weekends so perhaps avoid that? they also don\'t serve their other food items during tea time and will only start serving those after 5pm? (please check tho i am not 100% sure)
Anyway, they were right when they said these egg tarts from Tai Cheong Bakery are to die for.
CAN\'T WAIT FOR THE LONG BREAK AHEAD! 😛 the chicken chop quite dry though... 🤔
I\'m a fan of anything with eggs and this French Toast with pure maple syrup fits the bill just right. Pan fried till golden brown, the fragrant egg wash and milk hugs the soft and fluffy bread nicely within it! Another version with condensed milk is also available.
•\n<br />The reason for saying that lies in the fact that the bread had been heavily doused in a mixture of eggs and milk before being pan-fried. As such, what you\'d find is a piece of limp, eggy toast without a hint of crispness.\n<br />•\n<br />That said, there\'s nothing wrong with having a nostalgic sweet treat on a weekday morning. ❤️\n<br />•\n<br />P.S.: Tastes like the one which grandpa used to make (有阿公的味道). Price is pretty steep for a slice of bread. 😂
I have to say this scrambled egg on toast with chicken chop was very nice. Really suitable for breakfast. The egg was buttery and very smooth. Spoon some cream sauce on it and eat with the warm fluffy toast. Delicious! The chicken chop was quite forgettable thou.
When I walked in, this dish was on almost every table. So of cos I gotta have it too. Very homely. Very simple. The egg and the sauce-drenched rice were good but the roast pork did not have the crispy skin that qualified pork to be called roast pork. Overall a decent dish. Quite a big portion.
Sunday leisure date with my boys. We have chicken pie, hkg Chinese donut, egg tarts and durian &amp; cheese tart. Interesting taste of the donut which is eggy, milky and very moist beneath.
One that I\'ll go back for!😍😍 The highlight is definitely those fluffy scrambled eggs~ 😍😋 A #MUSTTRY at #taicheongsg!
How about some Scrambled Egg Toast Stack with Chicken Chop ($9.50+)? 🍳🐔 Don\'t forget to get some egg tarts after that...\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />This was taken at a media tasting.
Perhaps not.\n<br />Worth the queue? Perhaps if it\'s short.\n<br />•\n<br />That said, these famed custard-filled tarts were definitely one of the better egg tarts out there! It\'s worth a try if the queue\'s short but the quality of each tart may vary from batch to batch.\n<br />•\n<br />On the other hand, the •Durian &amp; Cheese Tarts [$3.60 each]• received mixed reviews from us - some enjoyed it while others called it a \'weird creation\'. I did enjoy them personally, but would\'ve preferred a lesser amount of cream cheese in the filling.\n<br />•\n<br />P.S.: I\'m afraid to stand on the weighing scale now 🙈
Mixed feelings. \n<br />Yes it was fluffy and silky and texture wise one of the best scrambled eggs around. But it was also a bit flat and lacking the familiar artery cloying buttery richness that one normally associates with HK scrambled eggs.
Went there slightly before 5.30pm and no queue. Ordered this macaroni with 3 eggs and luncheon meat, taste good but feel eggs overdose, maybe should try with shredded chicken next time. No service charge and gst. $30 on dinner for 2 include drink and egg tart!
Pan-fried french toast that is light crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Comes with a slab of butter that sits on the top of the toast and coated with pure maple syrup 》$6.50
Roasted Pork &amp; Crispy Pork Belly 》$9.90
Homemade French Toast with maple syrup. —$6.50\n<br />The toast is lightly crisp on the surface but very soft inside because it\'s made in-house. Melted butter and maplesyrup added up the equation. Overall, it remained light.\n<br />.\n<br />#taicheong #frenchtoast #sixthsensepr #hkfood
Dinner for tonight at Tai Cheong Bakery Cafe. Had to wait for a really long time despite waiting for a table for 1. The egg tart was a bit far from the one in HK. The yuenyang (milk coffee and tea mixed) was of an interesting taste. The main (rice with silky egg charsiew and roast pork) was a mix for me. The egg was really silky and the char Siew was nice, but there is a smell to the roast pork. I guess it might be worth to try once and try again after a long while...
3.5 munchies: Resembling an omurice dish, the silky omelette was drenched with savoury mushroom sauce and topped with char siew and roast pork. The char siew might be charred nicely, but unfortunately, the roast pork was sliced so thinly that you could hardly get a good bite of it. Thankfully I got some crunch from the sprigs of blanched kailan to go with the char siew, tasty sauce, and steamed rice beneath the omelette.
Buttery crust and that warm melt in your mouth egg custard filling is simply to die for. Not the same as the Hk one, but still one of the better ones in Singapore. Ignore the other tarts and just get what they\'re famous for.
First ever Tai Cheong Bakery where they serve cha chaan teng items like Bolo Bun, French Toast etc. Scrambled Egg Toast Stack with Chicken Chop, three scrambled eggs with buttered toast and chicken chop bathed in mushroom sauce. Soft fluffy eggs was a total joy though the dish is slightly salty. Not a fan of chicken chop? Go for scrambled egg option only ($6.50) or spam fries ($8.50).
Savouring Tai Cheong\'s homemade French Toast with maple syrup [$6.50]. 🍴
Macaroni in a tomato soup base with luncheon meat. This is like something you\'d eat at home. \n<br />Don\'t expect mind-blowing dishes at Tai Cheong Bakery. Instead expect comforting, simple fare that you can top off with a few egg tarts to complete your meal.\n<br />#TaiCheongBakerySG
3.5 munchies: Available only at the Holland Village outlet with a dine-in concept, the bowl of elbow macaroni comes in a rich tomato and chicken broth topped with three sunny-side up eggs and strips of crispy Spam. The soup is made from scratch and never left on the stove longer than 30 mins so it doesn\'t reduce and become overly sour. Break the yolks up and stir into the broth for some creamy texture! I could have this bowl of comfort food any time of the day.
🍳🍳🍳 Something that I would eat on a rainy day ☔️☔️☔️😋😋😋\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, you can grab your egg tarts here. The queue isn\'t as long as the one in Taka.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @sixthsensepr for hosting us!
Served with your choice of maple syrup or dulce de leche, this is one of the better options at Tai Cheong Bakery. But then again, butter makes everything taste good. More towards affordable casual dining, don\'t go with high expectations. It\'s a very cosy (shoulder to shoulder) kinda dining experience and with the queue, it\'s not exactly somewhere you\'d want to be chillin\' at after your meal. It\'s a good place to fill your belly or to pick up some egg tarts (the queue is shorter than Tai Cheong at Takashimaya). Plus a bonus! This outlet has a Durian &amp; Cheese Tart available. I wouldn\'t mind more of that! 😋
All settled for now though I\'m still pissed. Technically, I\'m on leave this week 😈 Now at Holland V eating my heart out! 1st stop: [TAI CHEONG BAKERY Dine-in Scrambled egg Toast stack w/Spam fries $8.50++] 🍞 Yummy! But I thought the spam fries very salty wor.
A really good egg tart with solid, fragrant pastry. The filling to pastry ratio is just right although the filling falls flat - lacking the aroma and texture to match the quality pastry. Despite this, it\'s pretty good stuff and definitely worth your calories, all packed into a gorgeous and sleek box. A worthy contender but my top pick would still be Tong Heng. Just casually keeping a lookout for the next challenger...
This is my first time eating at the authentic Tai Cheong for both their food and their famous egg tarts. 
Instead of enduring the two-hour wait at Tai Cheong Bakery\'s takeaway counter in Takashimaya, head over to their newest space in Holland Village to sate those egg tart cravings! The 42-seater eatery, identifiable by its signature teal signboard, has a shorter, separate takeaway line for their buttery, flaky crusted Egg Tart ($1.90). If you\'re a true durian fan, you\'ll appreciate the local creation of creamy Durian and Cheese Tart ($3.60) made with premium D24 durian pulp and cream cheese. There are both indoor and outdoor seating, where you can dine in to have your egg tarts at no extra service charge. Aside from the tarts, the eatery also serves hearty Hong Kong cha chaan teng dishes like Three Coloured Silky Eggs with Rice ($9.90), Three-Egg Macaroni Soup with Luncheon Meat ($8.50) and French Toast ($6.50). \n<br />Avg Price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim

Every bite reveals an explosive egg pudding paired with a delicate buttery cookie-like flaky crust that\'s neither too thick or thin 😋 It\'s served so hot that we had to pause mid-devour! 😍\n<br />• They also serve coconut tarts and durian cheese tarts for the more adventurous! • Now with the Holland V branch, you can dine in and enjoy from a range of Cantonese tea shop delights like buttered Bolo bun or condensed milk French toast! Traditional goodness at its best.\n<br />• ✳️ 1 egg tart is 150🆑 so we advise you to spread the love and share the desserts with your friends, though we warn that one bite might not be enough 😳 So don\'t waste your 🆑 on yucky, cold soggy desserts- queue to make every single bite worth it 👍\n<br />• Tai Cheong Bakery Singapore\n<br />31 Lorong Liput\n<br />Singapore 277742
Good egg tarts, but the chicken pie and bo lu buns were bad. All the food arrived cold too...
#taicheongsg
菠萝包Pineapple bun is a favorite of mine since I was young and thankfully, Tai Cheong bakery has brought authentic buns to SG. (PS there’s no pineapple in the bun. The crust is make of sugar and just looks uneven like pineapple skin) Definitely head to the cafe at holland V to enjoy a slab of butter in your warm bun. Mmmmmm. The best ever!!! #latergrams #drklingeats #pineapplebun #earlymornings #burpple

The fragrance of the freshly baked pastry fills the air as the egg tarts are served pipping hot from the oven.\n<br />The yellow custard greets you with its bright and radiant smile while its smooth, glossy texture send your taste buds into overdrive.\n<br />Savour the silky consistence of the custard together with the crumbly, buttery crust and relish the gustatory sensation
Thanks for the yummy #TaiCheongBakerySg egg tarts and the cutest wooden board 😘

You don’t have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to experience the cha chaan teng (HKG teahouse) feel because they are now opened in Holland Village right here on our sunny island!\n<br />.\n<br />I miss HKG more because of all the authentic HKG staples I had last night like this yummy bowl of Three Egg Macaroni Soup with Luncheon Meat S$8.50! Tomato broth is soooo delicious with elbow macaroni and fried luncheon meat… best comfort food! I am going to head back for more. .\n<br />#taicheongsg #singaporeinsiders #exploringsingaporeeats #whati8today #love #yummy #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #onmytable #beautifulcuisines #burpple #nikonsg #nikon5500
☹️\n<br />•\n<br />The crust has become thicker, and the amount of filling has been reduced.\n<br />•\n<br />#disappointed
This exclusive tart is made using premium D24  durian plup and cream cheese encased in their famed crust. The creation can be quite heavy if you are not into the rich and heavy custard, and of course durian.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood \n<br />#weeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #durian #cheese #tart #taicheongbakery #taicheongbakerysg

The generous portion of silky egg totally embraced the rice within, flavoured with tasty sauce and roast meat. A cross between Japanese omurice and Chinese Muay Fan, this was flavourful and comforting for a satisfying meal, complete with a creamy HK milk tea. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #hkfood #taicheong
The red beans with milk was surprisingly good and it\'s a drink that could hardly be found in other cafes👍

Somewhat like omurice but the meat was too tough.

which one is your favorite?
The cafe opens at 1030am serving pastries and drinks only, mains are served from 11am onwards. Go early to queue because seats are limited but you won\'t get rushed into finishing your food. \n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #sgeats #sgfoodie #burpple #eggporn #scrambledegg #toast #brunch #sgbrunch #onthetable #8dayseat #sgcafehop #cafehop #hkeats #hkcafe #taicheongbakery #photography #travel #travelgram #foodporn #foodgasm #instagood #instadaily
Original bolo bun (菠萝油) and char siew bolo bun (叉烧菠萝),$2.20 each. 😋
The curry is the sweet type with a creamy consistency, coming from the peanut sauce. It also comes with a dash of sesame oil for a aromatic finishing. The beef brisket was also cooked to a soft, fork tender texture. There is also an option of chicken if you don\'t eat beef.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #beefbrisket #curry
Trying out the new tai cheong cafe at holland v! These egg tarts (max 2 per pax for dine in) are really good but i still prefer honolulu\'s!  #singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #photography #weekend #holiday #eggtart #eggporn #hongkong #hkcafe #sgcafehop #burpple
Luckily they opened a bakery in Holland Village which was obviously more accessible than flying over. I was in the area earlier, therefore decided to get a box of three original and one durian flavoured egg tarts for him. As I have yet to try the tarts from their flagship store and he had, he shall be the judge of whether it tastes better here or in Hong Kong.\n<br />#8dayseat #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #eeeeets #exploresingaporeeats #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #foodstagram #igfood #instafood_sg #onthetable #openricesg #sgeats #sgfood #sgfooddiary #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodunion #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #singaporefoodies #sgig

Thank you @meilingsml for the egg tarts! 😋
😍👍 Customers may takeaway only up to 16 egg tarts per pax, while diners can have up to 2 per pax to enjoy after their meal. #TaiCheongBakery #MediaTasting
and just in a blink of an eye here I am having comfort food with awesome ppl and having that egg tart that nearly matches that I was so impressed with... Creamy Eggs, Crusty Toasts and Crispy Bolos add to the list of my favourites abt this long standing name that just got to SG!
How about having a change and have the Scrambled Egg Toast Stack with Chicken Chop ($9.50). This is cheaper than your waffle and chicken. What is more important, it tasted as good or even better. The creamy three-egg scramble paired excellent with the buttered toasted. Not forgetting the juicy chip chop underneath that is resting on a bed of mushroom sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #toast #chickenchop #scrambledeggs
This was simply majestic! And the prices here is pretty cheap as compared to other Cha Cha Teng\'s in Singapore! 
Only available at this outlet, not even in the HK or orchard one. 😉 Now at this dine-in, you can enjoy authentic hongkong dishes like macaroni soup and scrambled egg toast with chicken chop and my favourite french toast!\n<br />.\n<br />Oh! And no need me to say more about their famous egg tarts!!! 😍\n<br />.\n<br />#taicheongsg #hk #eggtart #durian
Yes you did not hear me wrong, there is a total of three sunnyside up eggs. What stood out is the rich tomato and chicken broth. This is goodness in a bowl and probably you can only have it here at Tai Cheong Bakery for the moment.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #tomato #macaroni

This is also the first ever dine-in concept that Tai Cheong has, given that all their outlets in HK are all for takeaways.

Instead of deep fried, the toast coated in an egg wash with milk is pan fried instead. It is then topped with a slab of salted butter. This resulted in a fluffy interior with a contrasting crispy exterior. I would recommend not to spend too long taking photo or it can turn soaky pretty fast.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #frenchtoast

This is like the Hong Kong version of omurice. The steamed rice is covered with a three-egg omelette, kailan and a choice of two meats. I had the roasted pork and crispy pork belly. Dinner has a choice of either roasted pork and prawn or roasted pork and beef too. This is a dish which I will go back for.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #taicheongbakerysg
