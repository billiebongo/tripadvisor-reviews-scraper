Made a trip down to this newly opened cafe at CBD and their latte was not bad. $5 per cuppa and chill in a spacious marble setting.
Just like the Truffle Fries at Atlas Coffeehouse, these fries do not disappoint!!! They were doused with a generous portion of truffle oil, and were very crispy. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
💖 By the folks behind @atlascoffeehouse , @lunarcoffeebrewers is located in OUE Downtown- catering more towards the office crowd. With the same minimalistic and sleek interior, the menu are also somewhat similar with that familiar summer chicken stew, shashuka, along with new additions of rice bowls to the mains. Only 2 desserts are available on the menu- earl grey and cold brew softserve. Served with maple-glazed cornflake crunch, the softserve far exceeded my expectations with a distinct, full-bodied earl grey flavour that had a pleasant, impactful lingering aroma. Texture was more towards the icy side instead of the creamy and thick kind, making it lighter and more refreshing on the palate. The maple-glazed cornflake crunch might seem to be just an enhancement for the visuals but it turned out to be a satisfaction to the palate with its pleasant crunch factor and a subtle sweetness.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
We arrived at the cafe 20 minutes past 7 eager to try mains like the rice bowls and miso salmon, but were disappointed when the server informed us that the kitchen had closed for the day. However, since the desserts and coffee were still available, we decided to give them a try as a pre-dinner treat, and we definitely enjoyed them! The Milky Way Soft Serve ($5.90) here is made from their signature Milky Way beverage, a white coffee cold brew, and had notes of caramel and nuts. While its consistency wasn\'t as smooth as other soft serves we\'ve tried before, its robust coffee taste made up for it. We also loved the shortbread crumbs sprinkled atop the icy treat, and wished that we could have it by the spoonfuls just like good ol\' Milo powder.
.\n<br />Back for the white cold brew soft serve and it nailed the caffeine spot with its bitter-sweet nutty fragrance.\n<br />.\n<br />Coupled with shortbread crumble toppings for an additional crunch.
Located within OUE Downtown Gallery is this buzzy cafe run by the people behind Atlas Coffeehouse. Seating is aplenty — there are communal tables for large groups, window-facing counter seats for solo diners and round tables for small groups. Lunar Coffee Brewers\'s menu features quick and easy rice bowls like the tasty Beef Rendang Don ($16) and the Gochujang Chicken Don ($14.50). The crowd favourite Salmon Soba Noodles from Atlas Coffeehouse gets a remix here — the roasted shimeiji mushrooms are replaced by pickled vegetables, while the cilantro lime yogurt is removed. In its place are two slices of house-made miso nori butter stacked atop the salmon, which can get a little too rich when it melts, so we suggest asking for just one slice of butter in your bowl instead. If you\'re a fan of their cold brew, The Milky Way ($7), you\'ll love the Milky Way Soft Serve ($5.90). Smooth and creamy coffee soft serve topped with shortbread crumbles for some crunch. Pro tip: Help yourself to the free-flow sparkling water on tap — what a treat!\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Muriel A
The Hokkaido Cereal Wave may be gone, but I am glad that it had made way for a whole new \"Sweets\" menu where they serve up soft-serve at just $5.90 (the Hokkaido Cereal Wave was double the price, though with more toppings).
This was yet another brilliantly executed rice bowl from Lunar Coffee Brewers — the Nyonya-style Rendang that\'s so shiok with the flavours of the spices and a balance of coconut cream which coated the slices of beef on top of the bed of Japanese rice that comes with Onsen Egg and Pickled Vegetables. To be honest, I am not really taken by this one — but, for a very good reason; it\'s actually pretty good for a Beef Rendang that I couldn\'t really take in the fact that I am sitting in a cafe having it! 😂
Quite surprised by the Lu Rou Belly Don here — Lunar Coffee Brewers ain\'t no hawker centre/coffeeshop stall but the flavours are definitely executed well here — the pork belly were braised thoroughly and really flavorful while delivering a bite from the slightly leaner bits with a layer of gelatinous fat over the top. Thought I would have enjoyed it even better if the pork belly were sliced a bit more chunkier, but I think that\'s just the meat lover in me thinking a little bit too much. Quite a hearty rice bowl to order for lunch.

.\n<br />Mondays are awesome when you can have the whole milky way in a bottle.\n<br />.\n<br />Else the nutty cold brew coffee is also available in the form of soft serve too.
Returned to Lunar Coffee Brewers to try their Flat White since I missed it for their stellar The Milky Way during my last visit. The Flat White is brewed from a blend roasted by Two Degrees North Coffee Co.; the cuppa had a medium body and a nutty flavour profile with a smoky finish.
My favourite bowl here, firstly because I love soba, and they added loads of the Japanese seasoning flakes thingo. Salmon was tender as well. Only complaint was the two huge cubes of butter they gave that eventually melted into a huge puddle that drowned the soba (that still tasted good but no). Maybe request for less butter!
Also another stellar bowl; could have been a decent but kinda boring kimchi bowl but the melted mozzarella cheese really upped the shiok factor yey fer cheese. Also glad their kimchi isn\'t weird tasting like some non-Korean places
Enjoyed this rice bowl the most, the rendang flavour is umami gooood 🙃love the pickles and onsen egg as well
Tender slivers of beef simmered in a flavour-packed gravy ladled atop Japanese rice with a wobbly onsen egg and Japanese pickles — what’s not to like?
Nitro Coffee ($6)
Creamy with a hint of sweetness. Best for a warm morning perk me up.

From Lunar Coffee Brewers at Downtown Gallery, brought by the same folks behind Atlas Coffeehouse at Duke\'s Road. Lunar Coffee Brewers\' menu focuses more on lunch grub such as rice bowls, while still serving up comforting and familiar items such as the Summer Chicken Stew which is one of the popular items back at Atlas Coffeehouse.
Hokkaido Milk Soft Serve, Pop Rocks, Shortbread Crumble, Maple-glazed Cereal, Mini Cakes. Looking past the aesthetics, this was one dessert we couldn\'t stop digging into. The Hokkaido Milk Soft Serve was smooth and creamy, with light hint of milky flavours that run at the back of tongue. Coupled with crunchiness from the maple-glazed Cereal and shortbread crumble as well as the pop rocks sizzling on the tongue with mini cakes that aren\'t too dense, it\'s a pretty fun and all-rounded dessert to have that can be shared with two to three pax.
The Milky Way had been one of my favourite white cold brews around ever since I had tried it at Atlas Coffeehouse and I am glad that it\'s pretty consistent so far — creamy with a nutty flavour profile with a reasonable level of sweetness, it\'s pretty much what got me loving it from the first sip back then.

It comes with an onsen egg that was runny, beansprouts and pickled vegetables!
The onsen egg was also runny, while the pickled vegetables are a great accompaniment to the rice with its sourish tones!

It was sprinkled with homemade shortbread crumble that was slightly salty and adds crunchiness to the dessert!
So refreshing on a hot day.
Hearty nosh in the CBD, serving nostalgic home-cooked flavours with a twist. \n<br />Love the coffee. #DFDCafe #DFDCake
The silence beckons the shy, subtle details out of hiding and into your eyes — beautiful.
