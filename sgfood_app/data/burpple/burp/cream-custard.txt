Totally in love with the watermelon cake at @creamandcustard! The watermelon slice adds a burst of freshness to the chewy, nutty layer of almond dacquoise and the thin layer of cream just complements - not overwhelms - the cake. The fruits and the edible flowers also add another element to the dish. Just chew on the flowers to get the aroma of petals together with the rest of the cake. Heavenly. The light cake is such a great way to end a meal! #watermeloncake #cake #custardandcream #JayneSaysTryThis
This chocolate sphere contains 66% valrhona chocolate mousse and passionfruit curd which gives a hint of lemon zest.
But close enough?
I have not try the other famous version. But this one I had is good enough for me. The refreshing fruits &amp; flower petals from this cake makes me totally fell in love with it. I think I can have a few pieces of this at a go!! 😍😘😋
Tried the one at Black Star 2 months back and I was mesmerized by it. 😍 Glad to say this is the closest I can get in SG.
In frame is the Passionfruit Tart $6.80 that we all love. 👍🏼
Comes with a hot dark chocolate sauce so that when you pour it over, the black ball will slowly disintegrate. Even thought it\'s dark chocolate but it wasn\'t as bitter as I expect. A bitter sweet dessert. 😋 \n<br />Thank you @creamandcustard for the invite.

Just nice I\'m craving for chocolate! [The Black Ball S$9.80] - Dark Chocolate Sphere filled with Passionfruit Curd and 66% Valrhona Chocolate Mousse, with hot Signature Dark Chocolate Sauce poured over😌
Meet Strawberry Watermelon Bandung Cake, the pretty sweet young thing from Cream and Custard! Right in the middle is a layer of sweet and refreshing watermelon fresh, which is surrounded by 2 layers of what tasted like sweet crumbly tart (made of almonds according to the boss). Right at the top is a layer of rose flavored light whipped cream, fresh strawberries and grapes. A very enjoyable cake! Never knew that Bandung and watermelon could go this well! By the way, Bandung is not in its original name but I felt compiled to include it because the subtle Bandung taste made a big positive impact to this cake IMO. Have to add that the service here is great too! All smiles and always ready to serve. When I was there, a child broke their plates and they were very nice about it. Absolutely no irritation was shown with their top priority being whether the child was hurt. Cafe is small but bright and nicely decorated. Come support them if you are near Tiong Bahru. I\'ll be back to try out their boss\'s recommendation, the Sundae next. And if you spend more than SGD 20, download the HollerOut app and key in the promo code  to get 10% off your total bill. 
White themed cafe - I love. I\'m not one who knows how to judge coffee but I so enjoyed my creamy smooth mocha. Something I really like about Cream &amp; Custard were all the indie mags avail for browsing! Smores tart was so so though. Didn\'t get a chance to try their famous watermelon strawberry cake.
The first time i came confidently without checking the opening hours and it was closed on Sunday. But impromptu mah!\n<br />—————\n<br />I like the croissant here which is extra crispy and most importantly, it\'s baked in-house. For a neighbourhood cafe, this quaint cafe is spacious and minimalistic. Known for their good service and sincere staff which should be commended. (We know how some cafes can be sucha snobs)\n<br />—————\n<br />We ordered:\n<br />- ham&amp;cheese sandwich\n<br />- honey roasted chicken and eggs sandwich\n<br />The staff recommends:\n<br />- Oozy baked eggs\n<br />—————\n<br />I love their desserts here which i will save to post another time.
Drizzled with milk chocolate ganache &amp; topped with fresh cherry.
4 munchies: My picks are the Crème Brûlée Tart and Triple Chocolate Devil amongst the wide selection of delicate, handmade cakes and pastries. Besides the crème brûlée custard that was smooth and creamy, the puff pastry was buttery and had a slight crisp to it. I also loved the hint of sourness from the layer of raspberry filling that balances the richness of the Valrhona chocolate, Baileys chocolate and hazelnut praline with a digestive base.
It was pretty good but the texture of the mousse was a little too rough.
from left to right - tropical delight ($6), bittersweet ($6.80) and passionfruit meringue ($5.60). my top favourite is definitely the passionfruit meringue! crust was so buttery great, and it is so hard to find the right sourness flavour of passionfruit! give me 1 more anytime and I can gladly finish it! \n<br />tropical delight focused more on mango, and the lychee on top was probably redundant to its taste. \n<br />my least favourite was bittersweet, dark chocolate cake with orange. dark chocolate was simply too rich and it covered the orange :( nevertheless, price was reasonable and cakes were promising. I would definitely head back for the pasionfruit meringue!
Hope that your day ahead is as sweet as this tropical delight 😊

| ft Passionfruit meringue at this new little pastries &amp; coffee cafe! The clean look reminds me so much of the pictures I see on Kinfolk &amp; Cereal.
We were too full from dinner, couldn\'t eat anymore. But since we were the only patrons in the cafe, just couldn\'t walk away empty handed. Gotta show new businesses some love! 😘 Friendly staff gave us recommendations to their bestsellers (Triple Chocolate Dome Cake, Tiramisu, Passionfruit Meringue Tart), but I went for the Earl Grey Tart and Salted Caramel Tart, to-go.
Was just going to take a quick peek after dinner, but the very friendly staff invited us to go in. Clean, simplistic little cafe, one unit away from #HiveShop workshop and retail store. Very little items on the menu but this place has a raw, earnest draw that makes you want to give them a try. Looks like the Tiong Bahru cafe invasion is slowly inching into the less-known neighbouring estates.
Home sweet home. Returned from business trip to a rainy evening. Really tired and sleepy, but couldn\'t resist swinging by this 4-week-old new-ish kid on the block @ Bt Ho Swee estate after dinner. First impressions: white, clean, minimalistic. Some resemblance to that of The Tastemaker Store few blocks away, but simpler decor. Not much in store for now, a very small selection of mini cakes and tarts.
Joining the popular Tiong Bahru estate is Cream &amp; Custard, a cafe which serves coffee and a small selection of tarts, cakes and pastries. Gloriously spacious with a minimalist white aesthetic, Cream &amp; Custard is a great spot if you are looking for sweet treats in that area. Go for the indulgent Triple Chocolate Devil ($6.80) or the well-balanced Passionfruit Meringue Tart ($5.60).
Find out which are the 5 at  http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/05/14/bukithoswee/
The meringue tastes like a dense and slightly sweet marshmallow and the tart crust struggles a bit before crumbling when subject to the vertical fork test. Elsewhere, the curd itself is well-balanced in its sour and sweet properties (although I could easily do with sharper citric stabs). 3.7/5
Really nicely decorated cafe. The waiters make you feel confortable right away and the service is good. The food is fresh and tasty while still being affordable.
The Triple Chocolate Devil ($6.80) is made with Varlhona chocolate with a layer of raspberry filling in between with a digestive base. A great thing to order, as the rich chocolate taste is briefly toned down in the middle by the raspberry.
Perhaps one of their better items there. Passionfruit curd was tart yet sweet, tingling the tastebuds with the meringue which is light and soft containing subtle sweetness.
Mango Mousse Cake with layers of lychee purée and mango sponge cake within. It\'s pretty intense with mango sweetness, though also seemed to be a tad too sweet as well.
Arriving the table all warm and jiggly, the butter cake itself was pretty comforting without being too dense or too moist, carrying a light buttery fragrance. Glazing helped to induce the sweetness, but the blueberry within it seemed to have added unnecessary sweetness somehow.
Hmm pretty impressive but i don\'t like earl grey tart that\'s all! The rest i liked it a lot. Love the cafe decor though! Outing was a pretty yolo experience as my jb friends initially wanted to send me &amp; sly to the nearest Mrt near customs but we end up at the customs itself. Bad part of it that We don\'t have a passport at all so we were kinda detained in the office but luckily they allow us to u-turn back to woodlands and I can head home! 😂 #whiteaddict

Simply because it had pineapple. A lemon meringue pineapple tart that lured me to its freshness, its pristine white meringue torched perfectly and pineapple which exudes a resemblance of a ray of sunlight. Tart base crisp and buttery, filled with a zesty lemon curd.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />An explosion of sweet sour tangy tones which stimulates, invigorates and scintillates the discerning palate.

.\n<br />Tangy lemon curd fillings to match my soury Tuesday. 😫
I really love the bakes here. 😋😋
Anything eggs are always good!! 😋😋
Oh... its cheesy cheesy!! 😄
Very refreshing taste. One of my favourite cake there. A little messy when you\'re eating it as the watermelon tend to slide off the slice. 😋🍓🍉🍰
In hopes of trying the Strawberry Watermelon Cake, I made my way down to Cream &amp; Custard yesterday but I was too late and most were sold out… so not wanting to leave empty handed I had a Smores Tart and Lemon Meringue Tart with a cup of hot chocolate instead. Both tart base were firm, buttery and had a slight crisp to it but I preferred the Lemon Meringue Tart with the right balance of sourness. The smooth chocolate ganache which was topped with marshmallows, cookie and crumbs was decent but nothing to shout about. Nonetheless the prices were reasonable and desserts were promising, so I have to go back and get my hands on their Strawberry Watermelon Cake!
On hindsight, love that the rose was so subtle in the cream and that the neat square of watermelon wedged in between was supremely sweet. Key: More toasted almond meal guys.. that\'s what stops the weeping。\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />#whati8today#eatoutsg#cafehoppingsg#sgcafefood#cakecakecake#sgfoodporn#8dayseat#sipandgulp#hungrygowhere#burpple#cakelove#creamandcustard
😍
I\'m glad I can have a alternative closer to home.
Enjoy your Saturday everyone! 🎉\n<br />Before we head back to \"slavery\" on Monday.
I like the passionfruit not being too sour but it balances off well with the sweetness and the meringue tart.
There are marshmallow, cookies and chocolate... an amazing journey of textures and tastes! Somehow this makes me feel like a young kid again! Those who are adventurous gotta try this!
By putting the #cake in a small container it really makes it so easy to eat with a spoon! So nice and cute! Lol! More creamy than usual and with the bits if crunchies on top. I can easier have 2 more...no...make that 3 more! Lol
After tasting it, I know why. The passion fruit part is sour yet so sweet! Creating a strong overall contrast and the crust crumbles right n the mouth. Love this!
The flaky &amp; airy croissant goes very well with the chicken and eggs! The roasted chicken tasted very much like those from a Hong Kong roasts store &amp; taste sooo good! While the mayonnaise eggs are creamy. Nice!
Quiet, clean and spacious it will be a very nice place to hang around for a quiet weekend.

Coffee here are made using Tiong Hoe Specialty Coffee. The Latte here ($4) has a strong flavour into it, but the milk does not balance off with the taste of the coffee, resulting in a slightly bitter taste.

The mangoes are locally grown and tasted sweet...a thin layer of lychee jelly in btwn and bits of lychees inbedded for extra texture. Was not too bad but mango mousse could be abit smoother and slightly tangy. #mango #mousse #dessertlovers #dessert #openricesg #burpple @cream&amp;custard #setheats
