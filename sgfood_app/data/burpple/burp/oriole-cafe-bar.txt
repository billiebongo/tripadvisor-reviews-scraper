This\'ll be the death of me. Seriously creamy coffee which left me wanting more. This small cup wasn\'t enough but it\'s also frigging expensive. Once in a blue moon indulgence.
The beef slices were a tad too dry, not a fan, but fries, salad &amp; the golden moscato tea were fab!
Soft tender lamb chunks topped with crispy bacon bits and melted cheese. This warm skillet of comfort is legit. High in protein from 3 sous vide eggs and complex carbs from sweet potato cubes for the bodybuilder. Speaking of gains.
So hungry that i forgot to take a picture before eating üòÖ really flavourful risotto in bisque-like sauce
Smoked salmon rosti is great for a weekend brunch with some friends.
The waffles were soft with a light, crispy texture to them and served in the perfect vanilla bean ice cream and condiments to waffle ratio. The miso brought out the caramel\'s saltier flavour in a subtle manner that didn\'t overwhelm our taste buds and left us intrigued for a second bite, and then more.
The fish wasn\'t as crispy as one might expect but they got the texture just right and it was less oily than its other counterparts. The cajun fries were especially well done because of their own spicy concoction of seasoning and had just enough crisp
There\'s nothing more delicious than a bloody eyeball‚Ä¶ ü§î\n<br />Time for the Halloween antics again! üëª\n<br />This year Oriole is serving up this refreshing, firm yet creamy (how else would you describe an eyeball? üëÅ) coconut panna cotta with bloody raspberry coulis. Available till 31st October \'16.\n<br />#OrioleCoffee
one of the good piccolo lattes i\'ve had in SG
Featuring one of my Favourite from a long time - Taisho White ($7). The M.A.D (Macadamia, Almond and Dates) milk was pretty legit, tasting full flavours from the drink. Pretty pricy at $10 but I guess I understand why.

Snapper really is better than cod when fried - and a citrusy, refreshing salsa always helps.
Loved the cold brew. It\'s really smooth, not overly milky with a distinct coffee taste. The muesli was alright, nothing too special though! Wished they had more ingredients and more granola crunch. All in all, still a lovely breakfast.
Light and fluffy hotcakes with classic maple syrup and a unique and delicious espresso marscapone. Devoured them all :)
Waking up to the smell of eggs &amp; toast is probably the best way to kickstart your weekend! The Mango French Toast is served with slices of mango in between fluffy egg battered brioche &amp; topped with almonds bits, espresso mascarpone butter &amp; mint mango coulis. \n<br />Drizzle a load of maple syrup over &amp; you\'ve got a fresh &amp; delightful breakfast/brunch! Not forgetting how fluffy the brioche is, paired with juicy &amp; fresh mangos, definitely a great perk me up combination right there! 
Rip into their Grilled Truffle Cheese Sandwich ($14) which consists of 3 cheeses (truffle, emmental and oak smoked cheddar cheese) on buttery brioche üòã Love the multiplied dimension in taste when you dunk it into their tomato cheddar soup! However, I do hope there is a stronger truffle flavour in this as I\'m a huge truffle lover üçÑ
Ordered a pot pie(chicken&amp;mushroom? I forgot its name) and their Taisho White Brew($7).\n<br />I\'m still a beginner in appreciating coffee but I can say its value is worth spending on. It wasn\'t too bitter but the flavor was really dense, can still get your caffeine quota.
Smooth and creamy with a strong coffee flavour without even a hint of bitterness.
Sink your spoon into a scoop of organic rolled oats cooked in Oriole\'s MAD milk, Goji Berries &amp; Brown Sugar. Then topped with loads of fresh fruits &amp; nuts with chocolate &amp; honey on the side. \n<br />Less sinful &amp; filling, you\'ve for a satisfied belly without worry about the calories. \n<br />This was a hosted tasting by Oriole Coffee &amp; Bar.
As how comfort brunch works, the Crab Cake Benedict ($22) comes with poached eggs, Maryland-styled crab cakes &amp; English muffins, drizzled with lemon dill Hollandaise. \n<br />The fluffy &amp; crisp muffins paired well with the perfectly fried crab cakes, making it the perfect savory start to your day. \n<br />As part of the new Brunch Menu, it is available on weekends &amp; public holidays between 10am till 5pm. 
Mango French Toast - Brioche egg battered toast is served with fresh mangoes, toasted sliced almonds, espresso mascarpone butter, maple syrup and mint mango coulis.¬†
It\'s a holiday~\n<br />#OrioleCoffee #Coffee *
What I didn\'t mind was these pork ribs having an identity crisis (they\'re named \"St. Louis\" but are marinated in \"kicap manis\" üòÜ)\n<br />What I did mind though was that parts of them didn\'t quite hit the mark of tenderness (in fact, the words \"hard to chew\" would be an apt description üò£) .
Weekends are for @oriolecoffee new weekend brunch! Hot favs are the crab cake benny, salmon rosti, and my fav oatmeal porridge made with Oriole\'s signature M.A.D. Milk. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio.
A chill place to hang out for coffee break when you\'re in Orchard! Great coffee and cold brews.
(capitol piazza branch) i was the only customer for brunch at 12pm on a saturday afternoon ‚òïÔ∏è
The go to comfort lunchtime dish. Fish tacos with a curry Mayo dressing. Simple but spectacular.
It comes with a main (usually $20++) and a good cuppa coffee. \n<br />Their Fish Tacos are really tacos you shouldn\'t underestimate. It greets you with 2 fleshy pieces of breaded snapper wrapped in each taco. In the taco is a Chipotle aioli dressing &amp; cabbage slaw, with an avocado mango salsa at the side which I like to scoop into the taco for an extra kick. A super hearty meal if you\'d ask me!!
Not a coffee person, this is creamy with vanilla infused keep me going. Maybe cuz there isnt much coffee taste. -M
 i love ribs, and this ribs are pretty good that i dont mind eating it again -M
0.5 munchies: I love my macadamia, almond and dates, but I really wasn\'t expecting this bottle of dairy-free, cold-pressed Taisho M.A.D. Milk to taste absolutely vile. The sourness in the weak coffee was unacceptable ‚Äì perhaps it\'s just me who can\'t appreciate a medium-bodied brew with extremely high acidity, or rather, under-extracted coffee. Holding my breath, I gulped down 3/4 of it only because it was a hot day and the Singaporean in me wanted to make my $8++ worth.

Embarking on an awesome coffee trail by @sgcoffeefest First stop at @oriolecoffee and I\'m happily caffeinated with their amazing Taisho White Cold Brew and my favorite Death Cream. Oh and this simple but so comforting Grilled Truffle Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Cheddar Soup. MORE on Snapchat @msskinnyfat #sgcoffeefest
Kicking off the trail at Oriole Coffee + Bar @oriolecoffee, we sampled some signature dishes and coffee. We love the Crab Cake Benedict served with two poached eggs, toasted English muffins, drizzled in lemon dill hollandaise. Heading to our next stop... The Coastal Settlement! #sgcoffeefest #oriolecoffee
We are trying out four #cafes participating in the @sgcoffeefest - starting with @oriolecoffee!
Their signature oriole coffee cake ,you may like it if you are coffee lover .Overall rating :3/5 
A nice dessert will bring u a good mood ,the pudding is light and fluffy ,u can taste the brown sugar and caramel taste  in every bite ,and most important is not too sweet at all ,I can finish  it by myself  üòçoverall rating :4/5 
Located just outside Somerset 313 on Orchard Road, Oriole Cafe + Bar is the perfect place to catch up on some work. Order the Death Cream ($9) to keep you going ‚Äî a creamy, yummy drink made with a secret concoction using vanilla beans, espresso and cream, inspired by a recipe from the 1980s. The result? Velvety, smooth coffee served in a bottle so big, it that can comfortably fill two cups. Those who need a caffeine boost while working hard can be like Burpple Tastemaker Fiona Ting, who added an extra shot of espresso to make it an \"absolute killer, kickstart Monday concoction\". 
Today, I have their fish and chips. While it looks nothing like the traditional fish and chips- more like fish tenders with chips, it is the best I\'ve had in Singapore. \n<br />You get 4 pieces of thick yummy snapper fish fillets, each in a nice and thin batter that\'s flavorful yet not too salty. The side of Cajun fries is also awesome! The only complain I have is that it does not come with any veggies.. Only SGD 19++ with a drink for weekday lunch.
Stiff coffee-grounds Angel cake sponge, espresso crumble, chocolate agar, crisp meringues, and the sheer joy of digging deep into that coffee anglaise core üíò I\'m a real sucker for textures. \n<br />14bucks/serving
Enjoyed it in all its creaminess and glory, but I needed an extra shot of espresso to make it my absolute killer, kickstart Monday concoction. \n<br />9bucks/bottle
Went there on a Saturday afternoon. Was surprised at how packed it was, as it was at an odd time, about 4pm. Service was top notch! And there\'s was an ongoing promotion of 1-for-1 for all coffees, that was pretty awesome. Shared a fried chicken sandwich with my mum, as the portion was pretty big. It was served with Cajun fries. So tasty! For 2 coffees and 1 large sandwich, total bill amounted to $21. Both of us left feeling happy and satisfied üòã
We proclaimed that this was the best dish on our table. The slow-baked pork ribs were so tender and soft, the meat just came off so easily. We love how sticky the sauce (kecap manis / Indonesian sweet soy sauce) on the ribs was because who can refuse that caramelized sweet smell and taste. üòç
We didn\'t expect to find a South Asian dish at Oriole. The chicken tikka was tender and the meat was well-marinaded with spices. Though it went well beers, not everybody at the table liked the strong taste and smell of garlic, ginger, red onion and other spices. üôä
I confess! This was my first fried steak and I was so confused about it. Is the steak supposed to be well-done and bland? The dry-aged sirloin steak tasted as if it was barely seasoned. And the most unfortunate event happened - as the breaded steak was placed on the roasted garlic mashed potato and truffle B√©chamel sauce and some oil dripping down from the sunny side-up, the breaded skin became mushy and it was quite a mess after cutting the steak up. Also, I prefer oily and savory bacon but the smoked bacon presented in between the egg and steak was so dry like pork jerky. üò¢
Though it is a common dish, it is hard to find a good Fish &amp; Chips in town. At Oriole, we were impressed by the crunchy batter and how firm and succulent the snapper fillets were. They tasted good with and without the tartar sauce. The fillets were definitely solid big for the price of $20 and it came with a substantial amount of Oriole-spiced fries. We were so full lor. üò•
Usual SGD 12++. Lunch Set Add On SGD 6++. I cannot resist ordering this when it\'s at half price! Yummy!
Usual SGD 20++. Lunch Promo SGD 19++ including coffee/tea/iced tea (12pm - 4pm). Delicious dry chilli-battered snapper fish and veggies served in tacos with Cajun fries and mango salsa at the side. I really enjoyed this! \n<br />I liked the delightfully light and crispy batter but found the fish meat a little bland. However, when paired with the addictive chipotle aioli sauce, it was just awesome. Reminds me of nachos with cheese at the cinemas but better! Love the Cajun fries too. A tasty dish that manages to stand out without being overwhelming.
Another one of my favourite coffees. This one packs in a strong acidity and lingering chocolatey taste that\'s perfect for a true pick-me-up morning-kick-in-the-butt. Service at Oriole comes highly recommended; the staff know their coffee and are open to introducing you to new cuppas or dishes based on your preferences. 
Obviously I need to have a picture for one nice latte art. 
The pork belly. Is so good. Like pants-dropping good. Not joking. And it\'s very filling for one person. 
Their house sauce is really good and spicy in their own \"Oriole\" way. Takes the Mexican tacos to a different level, their own way. 
Fish Tacos ($20) Truffle Beef Burger ($18). Usually i get sick and cant finish a plate of e.g. fishnchips cos its fried but this wasnt the case for this fish tacos! prolly cos of the sauce. I love their fries too. I didnt try the beef cos non-beef eater~the bill turns up to be $44. its not bad but not really affordable in my opinion. 
Not as good as the first time. There was just something missing in this dessert when I went back to have it again and the cake got soggy really quickly instead of being light and fluffy. It‚Äôs like the cake just swallowed all the sauce and cream that was sitting on top. Also in comparison to my photo of this from before, the cream looked much lighter the first time round and was presented much nicer.\n<br />Also it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to have both this cake and the Death Cream at the same time as it‚Äôs an espresso + sweetness overload.\n<br />#OrioleCoffee #CoffeeCake *
Soft succulent Meat peeled off its bone, there is no need for gnawing violence. Comes with fries &amp; salad. 
(Refer to previous post)\n<br />For a more detailed review, visit hungryseed.blogspot.com
It\'s portions are definitely generous and the food doesn\'t fail despite the variety, which may reason with you why the food is pretty costly ($20+). Try the Beef Cheek Tagliatelle ($22, above). The tagliatelle was slightly too hard in my opinion but the beef was tender, tasty and a hefty portion. Lunch deals stand too so go while you can! \n<br />Also, the M.A.D cold press coffee is a must-try. Don\'t say we didn\'t tell you! \n<br />For a more detailed review, visit hungryseed.blogspot.com
.\n<br />|\n<br />Among all the cafe food, pancake will always be my top choice. My way of eating is to tuck a knob of butter between the pancakes. Let the warm slowly melt the butter then poured over the sweet maple syrup. .\n<br />|\n<br />After trying dozens of different pancake, oriole pancake was one of the better ones. The eggy and buttermilk batter created a cake like texture. Their espresso butter excited the common taste and made everything interesting. Pure comfort. üòãüòãüòã
One of my favourite places in Singapore to eat with friends. Excellent service and consistently beautiful and delicious food. Pictures are the waffle mi\'so ($12) and the espresso hotcakes ($12). But I would also highly recommend the fish and chips ($20) and fish tacos ($20)! Coffees great as well, and if I\'m not wrong, they have a lunch set with a drink and a main for $25!
Drinking coffee makes me buzzy, but I might need some to kickstart the fresh week ahead ‚Äì in the form of this bittersweet dessert.
Nothing is sexier than eating creamy and luscious mashed avocado on crusty toast alongside sweet and juicy tomatoes. Ok, that\'s all.
Rustic and comforting and certainly not modest in size, this skillet comes brimming with bacon and sweet potato cubes tumbling atop runny sous vide eggs and roasted lamb stew. Available from 8am-6pm every day; great for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or an early dinner!
Humble Baked Egg Skillet - Roasted lamb stew, sweet potato cubes, crispy bacon &amp; sous vide eggs. #comfortfood
Fish tacos ($22) served with a side if cajun fries which are dayum good that i feel i can eat a plate on its own. Had an iced lemon tea ($6) to go with the tacos. Overall worth a try!
Snapper fillets battered and fried and tucked into the folds of tortillas, along with guacamole, mango salsa, coleslaw, and an overhead drizzle of spicy chipotle aioli.
What I wish would land in my lap when I wake up tomorrow morning: this burrito comprising lightly toasted tortillas enveloping creamy scrambled eggs, dressed with chipotle pur√©e and given salty, unctuous accents of Spanish chorizo and smoked cheddar cheese. As if that generous-girthed bundle wasn\'t substantial enough, it\'s served alongside fried potatoes (YUM!), salsa and guacamole.
The lamb looked dry but was surprisingly tender and marinated through. Share this. Unless you\'re super greedy! Review of the other dishes up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio. Think I may just pop by before yoga for a shot. üòú
If you are still unsure of where to dine at, why not head over to Oriole Coffee + Bar at their Pan Pacific outlet to have a taste of their refreshed menu. One dessert that I recommend is the Oriole Coffee Cake ($14), a cake infused with Oriole\'s signature house blends and served alongside chocolate crunch, chocolate jelly, crushed meringue and an espresso creme anglaise core. Decadent, moist and truly enjoyable. This was a meal hosted by @oriolecoffee
A hearty $16 dish of poached eggs, roasted lamb stew, sweet potato chunks, Emmental cheese, crispy bacon and spring onions, served in a skillet pan! I\'m usually not a fan of lamb, but it was tender and succulent. This is quite filling, despite having little carbs!
Sharing adult woes over sweet treats. Shall be dreaming of this coffee cake tonight. üò¥ Was surprised at how soft and spongy it was and how rich the coffee taste was. The meringue, coffee jelly, coffee sauce, praline balls and that oozing coffee sauce center was a perfect combination! Good night guys üëãüèªüëãüèª #burpple
Satisfying my coffee craving here at Oriole and I opted for my perennial favorite, the Flat White. Creamy, smooth and beautifully roasted, it\'s no wonder people stream here for their coffee over and over again. 
The waffles were fresh and crisp but the true star was the miso caramel. It added a level of complexity that was üëåüèªüíØ. Together with the ice-cream, it was pretty damn good.
This was the bomb diggity. Usually not a fan of sticky date puddings as they\'re usually too sweet and dense for my liking but this was light and fluffy and not too sweet at all üòã great place for drinks &amp; dessert after dinner in town! 
LOOK AT HOW CUTE THE BOTTLE IS!
Topped with some bacon and spring onion, you will want to dig into this immediately before the eggs get too cooked. This shakshuka-liked dish will make you wanna grab some bread to wipe up the remaining sauce at the end. This was a meal hosted by @oriolecoffee
Well they say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. After looking at this, I guess if this was served for breakfast, I will gladly wake up and make my way to the dining table. A Mexican burrito stuffed with Spanish chorizo, scrambled eggs, chipotle puree and smoked cheddar cheese. The wrap is served with a side of roasted potatoes, pico salsa and guacamole.
Think thick and rich chocolate brewed using a single origin Valrhona chocolate then bottled. A lighter version of an iced chocolate drink which will not be \"gelat\" after awhile. This is one of the new drinks in the refreshed menu.
I would go back for this!\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />#OrioleCoffee #Cake #Dessert
I left a satisfied diner as I was glad the battered snapper fillets turned out so well. From then till now, I have made multiple trips back, ordered different items and never once disappointed. Not one to rest on their laurels, they have refreshed their menu after bringing in a new head chef and I was privileged to have tried one of their latest creations, Fish Tacos ($20), inspired from the chef\'s Southern American influence. Using back the same type of snapper fillets, they are paired with a chipotle aioli, red cabbage slaw and, avocado and mango salsa, all in a taco. The dish is also served alongside a side of Cajun fries. This was a meal hosted by @oriolecoffee
With a wealth of culinary experience under his belt, Chef Randy Torres brings with him a repertoire of Southern American cuisine which includes new items such as Jumbo Breakfast Burrito, Fish Tacos and now one of my favourite drinks (besides the TAISHO), the Death Cream ($9). As the name suggests, this is a drink to die for. Inspired by a secret recipe from the 1980s, the Death Cream is made from a concoction of vanilla beans, espresso and cream. A bottle of this with some ice cubes and you are all set for your caffeine fix. This was a meal hosted by @oriolecoffee
Fluffy chiffon texture with a thick espresso curd inside and around. And that coffee jelly. Give me coffee in any form. #caffeineaddict
Couldn\'t miss a 1-for-1 when it comes to food so I gave their beef cheeks tagliatelle and capellini crab meat a go and both were surprisingly tasty even though they look very boring. Very generous with their ingredients as well, good place to go during lunch time or during a day out with your friends  
White miso is mixed into the caramel sauce drizzled onto this chewy waffle. Very subtle savoury flavour that works for me.
A mix of sous vide eggs,roasted lamb stew and sweet potato topped with crispy bacon.
Located in a quite corner at the Capitol Piazza is Oriole Cafe. Perfect for hanging out on a Saturday. Was more impressed with the main meal like the warm salad made of spinach and portobello mushroom.  
I have to give it to the people behind Oriole\'s M.A.D milk, one sip and a rich nutty taste takes over leaving you craving for nothing but more. Despite a preference of less acidic coffee, which sadly oriole\'s wasn\'t, this was easily overlooked with the authentic nutty flavor you just can\'t get enough of. I would also suppose the faint sweetness in the coffee came from the dates. Overall, remarkable. 
There is a 1 for 1 weekday lunch promotion at Oriole Capitol currently so these mains came affordably at $9.25 each! Sadly the pleasing price tag was the only great thing, the drool worthy description of the Cubano sandwich was deceiving. The actual sandwich had overly toasted panini, tough and dry pork filling. Thank God for the oriole spiced fries to fill the tummy after the wasted dry panini. The salad filling in the sandwich had an addition of parsley that some might not fancy. 
Piping hot, charred, and slightly sticky on the outside, Oriole\'s Asian take on the classic American ribs is one of my favourites. Unlike the usual BBQ ribs, the sweet Indonesian soy sauce lent a very deep, rich, caramelized flavour to the ribs. It doesn\'t have that tanginess from the usual tomato-based BBQ sauces, instead boasting an earthy sweet and savoury note. It may not be as pocket friendly as  Morganfield\'s, but for the bomb of flavours it\'s definitely worth it.
The fish and chips there were awesome ! The fish was filled with meat and it is sure to fill you up . Worth the price üòÅ
I kind of like the coffee sauce they provided with the pancakes! Pancakes were served warm, fluffy yet little crispy at the circumference. 
The delicate and smooth coffee with subtle bitterness at first taste was neutralized with the milk, and pulled me through the hectic Monday blue. \n<br />definitely a great choice for grab &amp; go!
Yes I know the latte art - if it\'s art at all - kinda sucks real bad; but this interesting drink, as odd as it sounds, didn\'t taste too bad. You don\'t really taste chili, just a strong spicy kick at the end of the drink. It does come off a little shocking at first, but the creamy dairy and mellow chocolate helps take the edge off after awhile. It\'s not something I\'d have everyday, but I wouldn\'t mind the odd cuppa to celebrate a special occasion.
Super delicious risotto with big crunchy prawns along with it, super infused. That\'s how risotto should be. Absolutely nothing I can complain about! 
Absolutely good toast I would say. Bacon not crisp to perfection but good enough. Saut√©ed mushroom were really good and not forgetting not that sausage and scrambled egg that makes the whole set complete in my TumTum. 
Pretty light on the palate thanks to the lovely yuzu zest! Goes pretty well with the vanilla bean ice cream as well
Congratulations to Oriole Coffee + Bar for opening a new outlet at Capitol Piazza. The TAISHO White ($7), in-house cold brewed coffee with milk, has been my favourite and perfect for our sunny Singapore. One is never enough, as you will stretch out to grab another bottle.
Had a group gathering at this cafe. Food was satisfying, but it\'s alittle warm in the indoor restaurant. Although staffs were friendly, but not really attentive. We order Caesar wrap, Capellini Crabmeat, Garlic Prawn Risotto, Fish n Chips, Beef Cheek Tagliatelle and St Louis Pork Ribs. Caesar wrap and fish n chips were fine, the rest are consider good. 
One of my favourite places for a cuppa joe in town. #coffee
Packed with a flavorful medley of crispy rice with smoked lap cheong (Chinese sausages) and a not so secret onsen egg hidden inside to mix together! The wild rice was exceptionally crispy, tasting almost like crispy claypot rice with a richly wok aromatic. Pretty awesome!
Have always been impressed with how they cook their prawns at Oriole. I remember their shrimp bruschetta was a must order when they first started out. The shrimp risotto really life up to the expectations, from the robust prawn bisque flavour used to cook the rice, the plump yet firm risotto, the soften &amp; sweet asparagus and of course the lightly grilled succulent prawns. This is clearly a winner. And did I mention their heartiness level has moved up (larger serving and it includes chopped up shrimps in addition to the 4 presents on top). Good value at $22.
I like the added crunch from the candied nuts. The cake was really moist and packed with shreds of dates. Only glitch was the toffee sauce that tasted more like a sugar syrup than a buttery toffee/caramel.
I finally got to try this. Although a pretty small bowl, but it was pretty good! Of course the photo doesn\'t do it justice as you can barely see anything. The rice has a nice lap cheong taste and was really crunchy and even better when eaten w the onsen egg below.
This is such a fragrant dish. If you\'re not hungry, the smell of this dish will definitely make you hungry. I love the taste of the bisque and the generous servings of the prawns. 
Best paired with an iced cold beer in this hellish weather.
Take away is even faster than dine in. Had to opt for take away and had to remind them not to charge me service charge. 
Love this photo with the flowing miso caramel sauce over the vanilla ice cream, freshly cooked waffles and a dish of sweet white chocolate &amp; pecans. You can try this Waffles Mi\'so the next time you\'re there!
Crushed avocado and smoked tomatoes on focaccia bread, topped with basil leaves 
Spoonfuls of warm Risotto on a rainy day is very satisfying‚Ä¶ A very bright and happy day for me. (‡πë¬Ø‚ó°¬Ø‡πë)
Really eggy and rather dense in texture, the waffle here has only the subtlest of crunchiness. Although it isn\'t the kind I prefer, it tasted pretty good with the vanilla ice-cream, thick miso caramel sauce and some white chocolate pecan nut sprinkles. The miso caramel sauce, which I\'d requested to be served separately, doesn\'t differ much from a regular salted caramel apart from being a tad more rounded in its savouriness.
Throwback to our last outing dinner: Steak Sanger ($22), Fish &amp; Chips ($20), St Louis Pork Ribs ($26) and Fried Wild Rice ($11) with a couple of beers. The food is pretty good but the places might be a trifle noisy to chit chat. My personal favorite will be the Fish &amp; Chips, that is crispy battered snapper fillets with oriole-spiced fries and tartar sauce.
How good it would be if there\'s some Fried Wild Rice ($11) in front of me now from Oriole Coffee + Bar. I am salivating from just thinking about the hidden onsen egg mixing with the crispy rice and Chinese sausages.
Nothing makes me happy like a table full of food.
A refreshed menu with a wider range of food as well bringing back their signature raven and yellowbord blends. More details on the web, www.jacqsowhat.com (link in bio) üòÖ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Happy mid-week! ‚òïÔ∏è
Finally got around to try this. I love nut milks and this was just nice for me. Thick and creamy. I like how the MAD milk goes with the cold brew.
The Fried Wild Rice ($11) is one of the surprising item in the menu, with crispy fried rice and a japanese onsen egg at the bottom. It\'s a pretty small bowl but taste awesome. Thanks @juliuslim for the recommendation!!
Throwback to Friday\'s dinner and foodie outing at Oriole Coffee + Bar. The restaurant not does great drinks, they take their food pretty seriously too such as the St Louis Pork Ribs ($26). Slow-baked kicap manis pork ribs served with sambal matah dip is always a welcomed sight.
It\'s just something about good Fish &amp; Chips ($20) that makes me wanna go back for more. Instead of using the conventional dory, Oriole Coffee + Bar uses fresh snapper fillets, battered them and fried till golden brown before serving it with spiced fries and housemade tartar dip, making it one of their iconic dishes.
It was an enjoyable evening meeting fellow foodies and learning many new tips from them. We had dinner at Oriole Coffee + Bar and our appetizer was the Fried Wild Rice ($11), which had crispy fried rice with smoked lap cheong and an onsen egg hidden inside. A pleasant surprise as it was a cross between burnt claypot rice and rice crackers with the smooth egg to alleviate the taste.
Feeling slightly under the weather tonight due to cold weather. How good it would be if there\'s some Fried Wild Rice ($11) in front of me now from Oriole Coffee + Bar. I am salivating from just thinking about the hidden onsen egg mixing with the crispy rice and Chinese sausages.
Classic set lunch @ $19 for these average ribs! They came with a hint of Asian spice (kicap manis) oriole spiced fries and a kicking good sambal matah dip! Comes with a side salad and free flow iced tea! 
Crispy goodness. (‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë)
Possibly the best Risotto in terms of texture for it was not too wet nor mushy; rice did not require much chew and the sauce was of a rather thick consistency. Garlic flavours are strong in the sauce, and prawns were rather fresh, but the dish can get overwhelming after a while so it\'s best to share it.
Was being recommended to try this dish by another Burpple Tastemaker and must say I enjoyed dish entirely; the crisp fried rice was cooked with oriental elements such as lupcheong and hence carried strong hints of aroma from its ingredients. A sous vide egg hides underneath so the rice grains get soaked in egg yolk after mixing the rice. This is one dish that I cannot get enough of, especially since it\'s part of the small plate menu.
Topped w a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce for sweetness. The candied nuts at the side gave an extra crunch. This is dayum. üòõ
Thinking of what to eat for lunch?
The truffle fries at @oriolecoffee are crispy with distinct earthy flavour and aroma.
- Garlic Prawn Risotto: grilled garlic prawns in arborio rice of rich prawn bisque with asparagus, a mixture of soft rice with a slight crunch from the asparagus and prawns so good that I literally cleared the plate and almost licked it clean üòÜ Really good for this wet chilly weather! Wish I could have a bowl to myself now!
Big juicy grilled garlic prawns with Arborio rice and asparagus in rich prawn bisque!
Oh labels. Cold pressed cold brew goodness at Oriole. Never been a fan of cold brew, it\'s too acidic for me though I love how it brings me to the edge and leaves me hanging. This one was bearably sour and I even found it enjoyable towards the end. Hope you\'re enjoying your cuppa joe.
3 juicy beef &amp; pork wienerli minis served in deep fried buns, topped with green chili mayo and belachan ketchup! Now, where\'s my chili crab sauce?
I knew it was gonna be a rough week, but nobody told me it was gonna be this tough. üò™ Could definitely do with more sugar now.
This dairy-free milk is made in-house from cold-pressed macadamias, almonds and dates. The nuts are soaked at least 12 hours before it is double-sieved to achieve its luscious consistency .
#oriolecoffee is one of the places in Singapore that serves white cold brew coffee. They even created a non-dairy version - Taisho M.A.D milk($8) which is made from cold pressed nut milk of Macadamias, Almonds &amp; Dates! The M.A.D Milk($10) itself is also available, which taste abit like Vitasoy!
Wouldn\'t hurt to have some of this awesome waffles mi\'so from #oriolecoffee now, it\'s fluffy texture drenched in that mi\'so sauce. \n<br />Desserts we enjoyed from last week\'s #burppletastemakers #eatup!
Waking up so hungry today, I think I need a table of food to satisfy me! Recently can\'t seemed to be full, I need 2 meals in a meal(must be exam stressüòÇ) Taken at last week\'s #burppletastemakers #eatup! Wish I could have a spoon(or 3) of that garlic prawn risotto now üòã Thanks @burpple &amp; @oriolecoffee for the treat!
And so, the craving for comforting, carb-heavy food persists.
Usually prefer my aglio olio with a chilli padi kick, but this one riddled with mild piquillo peppers isn\'t too bad, either. Quite heartening to see the chunks of crabmeat peeking out through the loops of capellini.
Can\'t wait for our next foodie challenge!
What did you have for lunch?
One of @OrioleCoffee‚Äôs All Day Breakfast items (available 8am‚Äì6pm). Two eggs prepared in your favourite style, juicy pork sausages, maple-glazed\n<br />#bacon, assorted mushrooms, air-dried\n<br />tomatoes, baked beans and toast.
Their sticky date pudding and chocolate coconut affogato seems like a good dessert idea too.
Imagine the texture you get from the waffles purchased at your neighbourhood bakery, soft and chewy. Improve the batter, make it crispy on the outside, top it off with vanilla ice cream, drizzle with caramel and add a dish of candy at the side for dipping. These are the components of the delightful Waffle Mi\'So. Located at 313 Somerset, Oriole Coffee + Bar is easily accessible and for those looking to satisfy your coffee and waffle cravings, this is the place to be. On top of their old menu, the newly revamped Oriole Coffee + Bar now has an all day breakfast menu as well. Check it out if you are in the area! 
Let\'s kickstart the long weekends by having some sweet treats from Oriole Coffee + Bar. Be sure to order their Waffles Mi\'So ($12) as the marriage of the fluffy waffles with creamy vanilla ice cream is a match made in heaven. The caramel sauce added a level of sweetness while the candied peanuts gave it some crunch.
Glad to be back after so long! #oriolecoffee
One of my favourite dishes from the eatup that night. The Crab Meat Capellini is a dish from the old menu and I am glad it has still found a spot on Oriole\'s revamped menu. Chunks of fresh crab meat mixed with capellini cooked in a way that resembles aglio olio, albeit with a stronger taste of the peppers that have been cooked together with it. Note: Salad and fries come separately
How about some classic Fish and Chips ($20) to make you hungry tonight? The fresh snapper fillets are coated in a light batter before deep frying and served with Oriole-spiced fries and housemade tartar dip. You definitely won\'t stop at one.
Apart from their excellent coffee and interesting cocktails, Oriole Coffee serves some pretty good food as well. The Cubano ($17) sandwich has slow-roasted pork collar, seared sous vide pork belly, Swiss cheese, pickled cucumber, green chilli mayo and mustard on a grilled panini bread. Everyone needs some good comfort food during the weekdays.
After a long day at work, how awesome it would be if there\'s some chicken tikka and iced cold beer served to you now. I don\'t mind an Iced Chocolate from Oriole Coffee now too.
A bucket of truffle fries is always a welcoming treat during our #eatup session last week. The alluring seduction of the truffle together with the crispy potato fries lifted the atmosphere immediately.
Life is‚Ä¶ delicious. üòã\n<br />#Latte #Coffee
Haven\'t been back at Oriole since their makeover. It always feel great to be back at this relaxing coffee bar. Thank you Oriole Coffee + Bar for having us today.
Oriole Coffee + Bar at Somerset re-opened its doors in January after a 2-month period of refurbishment, bringing back their much-loved signature Yellowbird and Raven blends and a larger food menu. Start the day with a flat white and Rueben sandwich, and for a hearty lunch or dinner, go for the Fried Wild Rice or Beef Cheek Tagliatalle. Cold brews are very much welcomed in this heat, and Oriole\'s Taisho M.A.D. milk is a stellar hit -- a heavenly blend of freshly brewed coffee with a non-diary concoction of macadamias, almonds and dates (hence the M.A.D.). Their coffee milkshake and series of coffee-based cocktails prove to be great hits as well! Conveniently located in town, drop by and satisfy your cafe needs whenever you\'re around.
Tried the highly raved cold brew from oriole. The mad milk which was made of nuts was unique but the coffee was a bit too acidic for me. Food was good, especially the sticky date pudding.
And I\'m not sure if my phone is breaking down on me or it\'s just the lighting but I cant seem to get it to focus on my pictures! üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
Seems to be more crowded after the revamp?\n<br />#coffee #milkshake
Cuppa was really smooth. Another place for white cold brew! How is everyone for Friday? It\'s TGIF!
In brightest day, in blackest night, let\'s kickstart the weekend with a cuppa right. Having a flat white ($5.50) on a Friday night instead of a pint is not a bad idea after all. 
Milk - *New* Non-dairy cold brew @oriolecoffee. Freshly brewed coffee using Raven blend, non-dairy combination of Macadamias, Almonds &amp; Dates. Hence, M.A.D.
Reuben canap√©s and mini Mantou Sloppy Dogs were some items making their rounds last night! üòã
Cold Brews usually have this unbalanced acidic or bitter finish but this was amazingly balanced. Hard to believe there is zero dairy and sugar involved; almonds and macademia created the smooth flavours that resembled dairy and dates carried the sweet flavour that doesn\'t make it too sugary.
Honored to be invited by Burpple to attend Oriole Somerset\'s Reopening Party. A night of good company, canap√©s and coffee. Had a try on the new Taisho with M.A.D Milk; no dairy/sugar added to the Cold Brew, and also had a hand of brewing my own cuppa from the espresso machine. Also a lot of activities from fortune telling, painting and also planting sunflower seeds and crazy photo booths. Glad to have such opportunities that Burpple offers to the Tastemakers because each outing is something different.
Goofing around the Oriole Coffee + Bar reopening launch party! Great food and even greater company. 
Oriole Coffee + Bar reopening launch party! The sticky date pudding is so darn good!
Apart from coffee, cocktails and cold brews we were also served an assortment if canap√©s that is being served in their main menu. Of particular interest of mine are the Sticky Date Pudding and Reuben ones; dishes I would like to taste in full size some day. Also the hotdog bun where the hot dog sits atop a sweet fried bun was pretty interesting too!
It\'s always at Burpple events that I had the chance to make my own cuppa. Previously did my hand-brewed coffee at the Coffee Appreication Workshop at Revolution Coffee. Got my hand at the espresso machine this evening where I learnt how to brew a cup of Flat White with the help of the barista!
Head barista bobby makes his yellowbird blend latte and gives a very technical explanation of coffee
Featuring my tigers and my claw
Didn\'t taste as alcoholic as it used to and had a crispy caramel shell this time? I somehow preferred the old version üòï. Needs a little more liquor kick and less sugar. But goes great with coffee!
One of the best places to catch up with others in town‚Ä¶ have you been to the revamped #OrioleCoffee? We tried a few items from their updated menu: \n<br />‚òÖReuben Sandwich (Coffee-cured salt beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese &amp; mustard mayo) \n<br />‚òÖMantou Sloppy Dog (An update from their old menu, in smaller portions) \n<br />‚òÖCubano Sandwich (For the pork lovers, with cheese, pickled cucumber &amp; mustard) \n<br />‚òÖFried Wild Rice (Not pictured, but MUST TRY! Super crispy rice, lap cheong &amp; slow cooked egg) \n<br />‚òÖCoffee! (Of course) \n<br />‚òÖM.A.D. Milk (Must try! Non-dairy milk made from Macadamia, Almond &amp; Dates, only at Oriole) 
Cuban slow-roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickled cucumber &amp; mustard. Comes with a side of salad &amp; spiced fries too!
Nothing brings people together like good food. Same old Oriole, new vibe, revamped menu. My favourite item of the evening is the M.A.D. milk - a unique blend of Macadamia, Almond and Dates that concocts an interesting nutty non-diary, smooth warm milk. For mains, we got the Reuben (beef) and Cubano (pork) sandwiches - both cheesy delights served with Cajun fries and salad on the side. As for the small plates - we shared the Sloppy Dog which was served in 3 mini buttered buns; and a very interesting Fried Wild Rice - salty, crispy rice pops stir-fried with \"lup cheong\" (Chinese preserved sausage), and a runny yolk buried within. Certainly an acquired taste, akin to scraped burnt rice from the bottom of a claypot, most of us liked this dish.
Have you visited their revamped cafe + bar at Pan Pacific Suites? Definitely a lot more bustling and a little loud inside. The #coffee is better too. I\'ll definitely miss table service (the best type of service when dining out alone so you don\'t have to leave belongings unattended at the table). Where are you having your warm cup of coffee on this rainy day?
So my bf suddenly craving for fish n chips n we decided to try fish n chips in different place.
üòä Alone time in cafes, but feel bad I\'m hogging a whole table to myself üò¨ But really wanted my coffee‚Ä¶ and wifi üòÇ‚Ä¶ #CoffeeAndCravings #Latte
I love #coffee because it brings people together üòä‚ù§Ô∏è Why do you love coffee? Post a photo to Instagram with \"Why you love coffee\" and the hashtag \"#OrioleAndFriends\" to stand to win a 1-for-1 coffee voucher at Oriole! 
The coffee smelt so good. The first sip didn\'t disappoint.
The coffee at this place was once the reason we visit this place. Once boast of national barista champion Keith Loh, to hold the helm, the coffee standard has managed to hold at a quality that stays till today. The only bizarre thing is that they took away the caramel latte which I\'ve not managed to find one as good, till today. 
Not your typical BBQ pork ribs, Oriole dishes out tender, fall-off-the-bone, asian inspired pork ribs. Rubbed with their special blend of kicap-manis chilli marinade and accompanied by sambal matah, this version of ribs gives you a mix of sweet, tangy and spicy! Sweet potato fries are also served instead of the usual, adding a further touch of uniqueness to your experience here at Oriole. One of my favourite things about Oriole is that they are one of the participating Merchants in The Entertainer, which means 1-for-1 Main Courses ^^ and the St Louis\' Pork Ribs is one of the main courses up for offer ( Àò⁄°Àò ). P.S Get a pint of draft Kronenburg Blanc (1-for-1 everyday from 3pm-9pm) to go with your ribs to make your dining experience an even better one. 
Out of practice. First time attempting a bear face in over a year. Totally miss messing around with latte art but glad I got the chance today at Oriole Cafe &amp; Bar\'s \"Make Your Own Coffee\" weekend pop-up! 
Smooth and pleasant. However not as wonderful as I remembered it to be. Body does not seem full enough and vanilla was barely there
Our brunch spread today #coffeeandcravings
Oriole Cafe &amp; Bar is the perfect place to catch up on some work or some friends in Orchard Road. With award-winning baristas, the coffee is easily the best in town. Stay sharp with a beautifully strong piccolo latte, or opt for more creative options like Citrus Sin or Chili Cholocate Mocha. If you\'re staying for a meal, go for the beef cheek tagliatalle.
Piccolo latte. The taste itself is between a latte and a ristretto Soooooo good! Bitter Espresso with a slight milky taste. Definitely deserved its name as one of the top coffee joint in Singapore.\n<br />#Coffee
Really weird tasting to have a maple syrup dressing, and Brussels sprouts (which are of cos bitter and an acquired taste), just a weird mix of flavors.
Hot chocolate. Love that they take pride in their presentation üòä
Tried one of their competition coffee--Citrus Sin. Not sure if I\'m drinking it right by squeezing the slice of orange in. Wished the taste of orange was stronger.
This is one amazing baby chicken, and the portion was so hugeeee that I was kept full for 3 hours. HEY, that\'s a feat ok! Hahaha! Changed the onion rings for a bunch of leaves instead! Really really good food and for a good price too! $22 for this chicky!
Close up!\n<br />[Hot Smoke Salmon S$19] - pepper, oak smoked salmon, poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise sauce, English muffins. Everything taste soooooo good, including the spinach.
2nd cuppa of the day and the last. Feels extremely great with good coffee &amp; a good companion @gene_wang !
Beef Cheek Tagliatelle. Red wine &amp; citrus beef cheek is sooooooooo tender! $22
The signature Fish &amp; Chips. Super fresh light battered snapper fillets. Freshhhhh madness! $19
Banoffee in a tumbler... Dinner after a long day... #burpple

Still my favourite... Just have to keep remind them to watch the temperature
Oriole Knickerbocker glory! My triple chocolate and vanilla ice cream, with brandied cherries, almond cat\'s tongue and double chocolate cookies! ‚ù§
Oriole\'s Full English Breakfast for her lunch! Ôòã
Hot pepper and oak smoked salmon, poached eggs with spinach and hollandaise sauce atop two English muffins! Ôç≥Ôòã
Not a good display, need more props and angles perhaps! ÔòÇ Still mastering food styling from the inspiring artist.
At least the French press is good to compensate for the waffle.
The griddle cake was lousy, it taste like any pre-packed ones left hanging on the shelve. But the dark chocolate ice cream was creamy and smooth, with candies cherries topping the pockets, the $12 tea set is not worth paying.
Freshly squashed watermelon juice was naturally sweet. Yes, I asked to opt out from the evil syrup but still, it taste sweet, so I think the fruit is sweet on its own?!
I love this Banoffee in a tumbler! Peanut biscuit bottom with chocolate, banana, vanilla ice cream and salted toffee atop! 
Honey Crumble Affogato with Ice cream! ‚òï
(‡πë¬¥⁄°`‡πë)!! So yummy!
Good coffee!
My beloved. Raisin scones, clotted cream &amp; raspberry preserved. Dedicating this to @lovetrustheartbreak as well!
Generous portions of prawns, scallops &amp; fish tossed in tomato-based sauce &amp; baked in parchment paper 
It\'s really good! Pudding is soft yet not fluffy. Worth a try :)
What I really love about this place is its wooden tables and dim yellow lights, a perfect place to have good conversations with friends after shopping in the orchard district.

Dry chili battered snapper, chipotle aioli and red cabbage slaw served with Cajun fries. .\n<br />What I love: the chili batter that was super crisp and actually rather potent.\n<br />.\n<br />What I didn\'t quite like: the snapper fillet was a bit tough, but perhaps that\'s due to it sitting around for awhile as we photographed it. Cabbage slaw? I think it was more like just raw cabbage in there. Dressing pleaseÔºü

One very unique thing which it is different from the other mocha is that it  is not thick which is a common trait among mocha but still have a very good chocolate taste! Kudos to the barista who pulled this! Well done!
Ended up doing a 50-50 sharing of the egg Benny and this. Lol! The prawns are very fresh with a very nice crunchiness to it. The garlic added a good flavour to the dish and the risotto is not overly cooked. Good good!
It tasted just as good as previously! Loved the muffins a lot!
Make salad eating faster and easier! Lol! The dressing is not too much so the wrap is not soggy. Quite nice.
Last time always preferred the one at Keong Saik but it is no longer around. üò¢ So this is the only place to come to have their coffee. Not Reay much had changed here but feel more like a restaurant than a cafe now.
With maple syrup and pork sausage~

My second time having lunch here. Set lunch at $19 super value for money. Since the ribs are priced at $26 ala carte. Nice glaze on the ribs with a distinct smokey bbq flavour. The meat was tender and slides off the bones easily. What a delightful meal!
The rice was soooo crispy that it tasted like rice crackers! Thanks, #POOPKhakis for the companionship &amp; @juliuslim for the recommendation üëçüèª\n<br />‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä #AldoraEats\n<br />#PostingOriginallyOfProfessionalism \n<br />#Burpple
The restaurant not does great drinks, they take their food pretty seriously too such as the St Louis Pork Ribs ($26). Slow-baked kicap manis pork ribs served with sambal matah dip is always a welcomed sight.
Instead of using the conventional dory, Oriole Coffee + Bar uses fresh snapper fillets, battered them and fried till golden brown before serving it with spiced fries and housemade tartar dip, making it one of their iconic dishes.
We had dinner at Oriole Coffee + Bar and our appetizer was the Fried Wild Rice ($11), which had crispy fried rice with smoked lap cheong and an onsen egg hidden inside. A pleasant surprise as it was a cross between burnt claypot rice and rice crackers with the smooth egg to alleviate the taste.
The fresh snapper fillets are coated in a light batter before deep frying and served with Oriole-spiced fries and housemade tartar dip. You definitely won\'t stop at one.
Good Fry-day!
Be sure to order their Waffles Mi\'So ($12) as the marriage of the fluffy waffles with creamy vanilla ice cream is a match made in heaven. The caramel sauce added a level of sweetness while the candied peanuts gave it some crunch.
The Cubano ($17) sandwich has slow-roasted pork collar, seared sous vide pork belly, Swiss cheese, pickled cucumber, green chilli mayo and mustard on a grilled panini bread. Everyone needs some good comfort food during the weekdays.
I don\'t mind an Iced Chocolate from Oriole Coffee now too.
The alluring seduction of the truffle together with the crispy potato fries lifted the atmosphere immediately.
Spending my days cramming for the final examinations and right now, I\'m really craving this affogato from Oriole Coffee + Bar badly. A shot of espresso, vanilla ice cream and cookie crumble. Perfect for any occasion! I wish study snacks came in the form of this.
The salad was ordinary I guess. But the serving is quite big. don\'t really fancy the sou vous egg though. Will be back to try the sticky date pudding though!! Also, it\'s a great place to have a cup of coffee and chill with friends!!:)
Finally tried their cold brew black.
Love the added M.A.D. Milk!!!
