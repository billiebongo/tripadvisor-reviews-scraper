Beetroot risotto? Well, it\'s not as bad as what you\'re thinking! Besides its vibrant colors, texture was cooked to perfection, soft with a chewy bite. No overwhelming flavors but a torch of sweet subtle-ness to it. It\'s pleasantly done well! Moreover! It\'s a healthy choice of food! And food tasted better with 1-1 deal from the entertainer app!
I love @plentyfullsg for their healthy lunch plates. Today\'s choice was mentaiko halibut for proteins, salad and pumpkin for base and for vege, I opted for the cauliflower gratin and the sprouts cooked in fish sauce caramel. The sprouts were outstanding.
We enjoyed this gratinated bucatini bolognese for several reasons. It had interesting charred kinda umami that was smokey and good. There was generous amount of meat in the pasta. The pasta was thicker than usual, like an udon and was pleasant to chew. \n<br />Comparatively, there were more varieties on their dinner menu than lunch\'s. Quite like their kinda food so we\'d be back again.
Been a while since I had lunch at @plentyfullsg and so happy to see them still churning out healthy lunch options. I had the corn and quinoa and saffron rice for my base today. Protein was otah salmon and completed my meal with beetroot and orange and haricot with yuzu dressing. So happy to be back to eating cleaner.
Sometimes, hearing isn\'t enough. We had to verify for ourselves if this place deserves its overpriced label. We found that it does. $12++ for rather bland, lumpy congee and $20++ for a cheese and egg sandwich is hardly justifiable.
üòåThe burnt miso plated on the plate once again made me excited, not to say the melt-in-your-mouth souffl√© that has a tinge of savoury. I\'m in cloud nine ‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è
Plated beautifully with mint sauce, yoghurt, edamame &amp; horseradish, the lamb ribs are cooked to melt in your mouth with every bite. Sounds incredulous? Then try this at  Plentyfull, where Chef Victor has recently launched new menu items such as Beetroot Risotto and the Seasonal Vegetable Tart as well!
I always pick pistachio desserts so of course, I had to try this. The pistachio cake layers were packed with flavour and were quite dense but still moist. My only disappointment was that the other layers were solid cream and while it didn\'t take away from the robust pistachio flavour, it didn\'t compliment it very well either. I suppose it doesn\'t help that I\'m super fussy with cream. But, I ended up deconstructing it and only eating the cake layers - which, I think would have done very nicely as a loaf cake cos it tasted so dang good.
I opted for quinoa as the base, chicken as the protein, zucchini and mushroom as the sides. The chicken is tender and not dry, though I think it\'s not that cooked? It actually looks a little pinkish to me. I was pondering whether I should eat it but it didn\'t taste raw so I thought it should be safe to eat. The zucchini is nice though it tasted a little cold to me (same goes for quinoa, which I thought should be warm but well) and there was a weird crunch in it though I\'m not sure exactly what it is. I think the one that tasted the best is the mushroom, warm and flavorful!!!! I opted sambal belachan as the sauce but it was a tad too spicy for me. Given an option, I wouldn\'t come back here again because honestly, at the price tag ($17++), I would rather go to The Daily Cut that would give me more serving of protein and food that tasted waaaaaaay better than this. Or Grain Trader, which has an equivalent price tag but obviously has a better quality than what I had here. This is just me though.
A quality burger that satisfied. Love the thick fries. Wish that they could open their dinner menu for lunch. Lunch menu is pretty limited as it is.
Some of the new items include their House Charcuterie, which includes meats such as their 5J Jamon Iberico and 777 Duck Breast Prosciutto, mains such as the Glazed Acorn Fed Pork Jowl and Grilled Spiced Lamb Ribs, as well as new desserts such as their Coconut Creme Br√ªl√©e and the deliciously memorable Miso Souffl√©.\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />This Seasonal Vegetable Tart should happily satisfy gourmand mice and cheese fetishists.
Plentyfull brunch platter for the ravenous, with sausage patties, bacon, sourdough, marinated tomatoes and thick cut potato fries which are so addictive.
Salmon teriyaki with barley and quinoa as base. For sides, I chose the beetroot salad and heart of palms. First time trying them
Dreaming up an afternoon t√™te-√†-t√™te with these delectables. #foodporn #burpple #plentyfullsg
I\'d expect a Green Shakshuka to be similar to a traditional shakshouka, with a stewed/pur√©ed green peppers, veggies, or chili base. Plentyfull\'s take however ended up being more akin to a lentil stew than anything shakshouka-y. First off, eggs aren\'t cooked in a nice hole-in-a-pan with it\'s whites absorbing some of the flavours of the stew; second, nothing green in there except lentils and chard (or was it kale); and really, it was more soupy than anything. Like I said, not a bad dish at all ‚Äî it\'s quite reminiscent of a daal really, just wetter ‚Äî but NOT in any way a shakshouka.
Step into this space and you\'ll feel like you\'ve been transported to a beachside restaurant/bar -- the high ceiling, patterned tile flooring, potted plants hanging artfully from the ceiling and glass windows leave you feeling especially relaxed. My family were drawn in as we were walking back after dinner and succumbed to ordering drinks and cake. Their cakes are seriously delightful. The coconut and mango cake pictured in the background ($9.00) had light mango cream and slices of mango layered between incredibly fluffy sponge cake that just burst with flavour. The coconut flakes coating the surface added a nutty depth that complemented the sweet sponge well. We were so impressed that we also got their banana bread and lemon chiffon cake (each $2.50 per slice) to take home, which turned out to be excellent choices. Their dinner menu isn\'t extensive, but the aroma wafting in the air yesterday night guarantees that I will be back!! Unfortunately the drinks pictured here, the hot cocoa and matcha latte (each $6.50) were powdery and didn\'t taste great. I\'ll give their coffees a shot next time.
Love the space and this Queen\'s cake ($9) - light delicate and moist sponge cake with hints of fruitiness from layers of rose cream, raspberries and lychee; spiked with rum, subtle enough for a more interesting addition to the floral, fruity flavours. 
I had passed this place a few times and decided to try it out. Had the fried egg and mushrooms on sourdough toast ($16) for brunch and enjoyed it thoroughly ‚Äì the portion was just right (I did not want a heavy meal) and the dish was flavourful and delicious. On seeing the bill, I was pleasantly surprised that the earl grey tea I had ordered cost only $3 paired with the meal, instead of the menu price of $7. I\'ll definitely be back to try the other dishes! #BurppleXChope

Plentyfull‚Äôs Brunch Plate ($24+) comes pretty hearty with organic scrambled eggs, housed-made duck sausage patty, crispy housed-smoked bacon, plum tomatoes, stacked potatoes and toast.
The dizzying selection of sweets made choosing extremely tough; it didn\'t help that they all seemed to have my name on it! Eventually settled on what we felt would be a refreshing end to a filling meal, and it sure didn\'t disappoint. The yuzu curd bore the right amount of zest ‚Äì bright, yet not cringe-inducing. The meringue was really lovely as well; it tasted like toasted marshmallows üòç Can\'t wait to try the other cakes and bakes. The chocolate fudge cake and coconut cake (with liquor!) beckon especially.
Just when I thought I\'d made an excellent choice with that Pumpkin Gnocchi...then BAM. My friend\'s order came and trumped it instantly. Lucky for me, she wasn\'t hungry so I \"helped\" to finish half of these ‚úåÔ∏èÔ∏è
I\'m craving for this again as I type. The composition of ingredients was brilliant, as was the individual elements, each a stand-out on its own. Starting from the pumpkin dumplings themselves; they were pan-fried, lending a nice charred flavour to each soft-chewy pillow. Adding savouriness and sharpness to the mix was the Pecorino crisp, which provided texture as well, together with crunchy kale. And that brown butter &amp; sage sauce. Man, it\'s wicked. The absolute bombz.
Another place where you can choose your healthy selection of vegetables and protein. I had set A where you can choose one protein, one base and 2 sides. I ordered an additional protein and my total bill came up to $22. So if you are into the protein vegetable diet, this is one place you can check out. Unlike the other similar outlets, this place has ample sitting and a nice spacious ambience.
A slice fit for royalty. The delicate strawberry sponge cake is layered with rose cream, raspberries, and lychees. Floral and fruity, among the better cakes I\'ve had. A must try.
Beautifully seared, tender pork jowl with nice silvers of marbling, savoury and smoky in flavour, so delicious.
Pasty Chef Alicia baked this \'cheesecake of the day\' over the weekend. Has a rich, creamy texture, and the floral sweet flavours of cinnamon and maple syrup are lovely.
Chef Victor showcases creativity in the simplest of dishes, like this warm, home baked, crisp flatbread.
They make pretty good desserts here, like this wobbly yuzu curd in a buttery, crumbly tart base. Notes of zesty and tangy, with a sweet caramelised meringue that is light and airy. Shiok!
Smoky and tender fillet of fresh, sweet barramundi, in a zesty yuzu wasabi broth, with crunchy leeks, seaweed, and tender broccolini. Bold flavours!
(I hear their Tiramisu and Choux Puff are more spiked than a baby porcupine, so that\'s my Plentyfull restoration journey penned in the schedule-book right there.) #7DaysofRestoration\n<br />‚†Ä\n<br />Fairly chuffed to be able to try the newly-launched Aesop Lucent Facial Concentrate, which purports to supply my occasionally greasier-than-orh-luak combination skin with concentrated doses of vitamins, intense hydration and nourishing botanicals. Stay tuned to my glorious transformation from oyster pancake to sleek and smooth Dorayaki on my new lifestyle and beauty blog, Pupitar Diaries...(just stop, right there - Reality Check Editor).
I love anything citrusy..so when i saw this i knew i had to try. The sweetness of the meringue complemented the sourness from the yuzu bits found in the tart..sth different from the usual lemon meringue! Would be back to try more desserts! Yums: 3.5/5
The space at Plentyfull speaks of abundance, light and comfort. Since the set menus are only available Mon - Fri lunch time (correct as of post date), I decided to go for the steak. I can\'t really recall what went into sauces, but it complemented very well with the spring onions and meat. You can easily taste that the meat was already naturally well marbled and medium rare doneness was right on point. Portions are huge and true to her name, plentiful.
As much as I was satisfied with my previous visit where I had their lunch bowl and a Choux puff, I was sadly disappointed by their rendition of a Creme Br√ªl√©e. Kept chilled in the freezer and only sprinkled with sugar and blowtorched upon serving, the concept of Creme Br√ªl√©e seemed awfully mistaken here ‚Äî the top is missing of the crackling sugary layer, instead replaced with simply sugar granules melted and with a blowtorch that felt like it was quite a huge miss. That being said the flavour is still good; smooth, eggy custard with the flavours of torched sugar. Hopefully they could refine the execution of this though ...
Plentyfull is refined ‚Äî the spacious bistro cum grocer is bright and tasteful, and the various seating areas (there\'s a private dining room, booth seats and a communal area) make this the perfect spot both for a business meeting over lunch or a reunion with your university mate. Foodwise, they offer build-your-own bowls, so let your creativity loose! Set A ($17) comes with one base, one protein and two sides while set B ($19) comes with three sides. We recommend the risoni, short cut pasta shaped like rice, as your base and the very tender, unbelievably delicious soy and ginger caramelised pork belly as your protein. For sides, the Caramelized Parsnip and Spiced Carrot and Maple and Bacon Brussel Sprouts are both very tasty, and portions are generous. There are only three sauces here, and they\'re all good, especially the addictively good chili jam that resembles Indonesian chili!\n<br />Avg price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayne Tan
A place of restoration with great tasting, honest food that is good for you. Loved the spaciousness of the place, and the quality ingredients that went into the food on my plate. The teriyaki salmon was beautifully marinated with a sweet-savory glaze, and I really enjoyed the caramelized parsnip &amp; spiced carrots. Set A ($17) gives you a choice of 1 base, 1 protein and 2 sides. Definitely go for the sambal chilli if you enjoy a spicy kick, and/or the sweet-spicy chilli for added flavour. While there was quite a tight selection, it was sufficient to make me feel like I was spoilt for choice on this first visit, and every item was delicious. Hoping they will rotate their selection, and I\'ll definitely be back to check out the gorgeous desserts on display!
Really enjoyed my Set A (1 base, 1 protein, 2 sides), and it was very filling. The chicken was very tasty, the risoni was the perfect base with herbs like parsley and mint in it, and the roasted veg were really well done. Big love for the sauces! I asked for all 3 cos couldn\'t decide. One was yoghurt based and went well with the risoni, while the sweet chili went with everything. The spicy chili reminded me of that amazing chili mixture you get with your Babi guling in Bali! Fab with the chicken. Also managed to try the incredibly soft pork belly, and the beautifully smoked salmon from my friend\'s plates. The space is so pretty too!
From Plentyfull at Millennia Walk; a new eatery-cum-grocer concept that serves grain bowls and a variety of bakes for dessert. I can\'t resist Choux Puffs, so this was definitely in my check list when I took a peek at the dessert counter before ordering my grain bowl. It\'s delightfully crisp exterior wasn\'t too sweet despite doused in icing sugar, while the pastry itself was also of a good thickness. Inside, the cold, oozing (and almost liquid btw) vanilla cream eagerly bursts it\'s way through while spiked with a good amount of alcohol for a little booziness that\'s pretty dreamy and alluring ‚Äî really quite decent to have with a cup of coffee. At $6 though it might come as a bit pricey, but I would probably order this again if I were to visit Plentyfull again over a leisurely tea break or to do some work over the laptop.
Set A comes with a choice of One Base, One Protein and Two Sides. For the sides, I went for the Roasted Kin Yan Farm Mushrooms, and Caramalised Parsnip and Spiced Carrots while going for the Risoni for the base and Soy &amp; Ginger Caramalised Pork Belly for the protein. The whole grain bowl actually worked very well; well-portioned with well-executed dishes which are flavoursome and pretty wholesome. Risoni would fit those who prefer small pasta grains which are a tad chewier, whilst cooked with mint, parsley and dill. The Soy &amp; Ginger Caramalised Pork Belly carried sweet and savoury flavours; very soft and tender and easily pulled apart with a fork, whilst the two sides were also pretty well done; the mushrooms were earthy yet carried sweet flavours from caramalised onions and the spiced carrots feel very much like sweet potatoes; soft and sweet. Each grain bowl comes with a choice of three sauces (or you could ask and get all three like what I did); a lethal Sambal Belachan; a savoury and sweet Chili Jam and a white sauce with cucumber that tasted quite Indian-inspired ‚Äî all three were enjoyable but the Sambal Belachan was seriously fiery; they weren\'t even joking about how chokingly spicy it could get. Probably one of the places I would return to for lunch one day especially if I were to crave for something light, and although it\'s just a little behind Grain Traders in variety, Plentyfull is pretty much a good alternative if you don\'t want to travel all the way down to Raffles Place or Tanjong Pagar to solve your grain bowl cravings.

‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Dorayakai, a typical and popular Japanese pancake loved by many. Chef Bruno\'s version had maple syrup chantilly and topped with caramelized pecan nuts. Here, a magical sprinkling of icing sugar before the nut goes on top. Texture of pancake was light and soft.

The pandan creme br√ªl√©e was velvety soft and smooth. But the gula melaka ice cream was my favorite component of the dish. Slightly salted, it really cut off the sweetness of the overall dish. It was such a thoughtful and well-executed dessert.

So this is a late late light lunch which can be teabreak.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Alas, no mains or salads here at this late hour... just small bites. This was literally a teeny bite. A roasted quail. So tiny. The drumstick looked so cute. A nice golden brown. Flavorful seasoning and marinades. Could do with less salt.
