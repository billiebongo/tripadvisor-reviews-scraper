The massive scallops had a nicely grilled and salty outer layer with a vulnerable and signature scallopy rawness in their centres. The apple sauce was bossy with its sucre agenda but did not shower after its tawdry affair with hawthorne thus leaving the most tell-tale traces behind, whilst the apple slices tasted positively alcoholic. 4.1/5 
Deep-fried snapper in light, crispy batter. Love the thick-cut fries that stay crisp even after they cool.
One of the amazing $13++ lunch items at :Pluck, which is essentially a sandwich stuffed with grilled bone marrow, caramelised onions and cheese, with a little tangle of watercress and pickled radish salad.
Essentially butter fried rice with tempura and veggies. While the grilled cauliflowers were pleasant, the tempura-esque battered florets were a revelation, tasting almost prawn-like with their exuberant crunchiness as your teeth tears through the batter skin. 3.9/5 
A curious mix of mediocre and flat-tasting cake, refreshing coconut sorbet, peanut butter, sweet mandarin orange and a sharp and wickedly citric gel that would wake you right up, curl your toes and make you wince and then shudder in sweet acid pleasure. 4/5 
Whilst the baby bird tasted its age and probably indulged in luxurious spa body rubs with exotic herbs sponsored by Mama Bird, I was not a fan of the sesame puree, which tasted like a tempestuous collaboration between sesame paste and chicken liver, with results that were more plop than squawk. 3.6/5 
Essentially lobster served with a crabby, spicy soft-boiled egg gravy. The prawn was massive, buttery, bitter and really, really phat (this tiger probably hid in its den and remained sedentary during its lifetime, relying on servant prawn cubs to hunt and serve it meals) whilst the mantous had nice and crispy skin. 4/5 
The 24 hours braised short ribs is flavourful and has a tender and chewy texture. The sweet wine braised plum is not too sour. However the squid ink bolotti beans lack a taste. Dip with broccoli puree that is unique and tasty, you won\'t feel jelat just by eating meat.
The 18 hours braised pork neck is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Even though it tastes a bit like roasted pork that you can get in hawker center, the former has lesser fat content. Succulent meat that is juicy and not dried up, add a dip of honey roasted chestnut sauce to obtain a balance between the richness in flavour between the two.
The tiger prawn is very fresh with a tinge of sea saltiness. It has a tender meat that is chewy. Combined with chilli crab puree that adds a bit of spiciness to the prawn, it brings a different dimension of taste to the marine creature. Some may think that adding chilli crab puree may mask the taste of the prawn but I think otherwise because it\'s tasty and not overwhelming. Coupled with the fried mantou they provide to dip into the chill crab puree, it\'s just too perfect.
The polenta puree is light, fluffy and creamy in taste and not overwhelming. Chicken skin crisps, in contrast to the polenta puree, is the main highlight, is flavourful and not too salty. All in all, it\'s very appetising.
I didn\'t like this. The squid crumble taste is overpowering and too crunchy.  Panna cotta has too much gelatin and became a firm pudding.
It was a pity that the gnocchi standard was not consistent throughout the whole dish. But the chicken was good.
Intersting to have barley as risotto. Escargot was not gamey at all. Quite yummy
Unfortunately, we concluded that the food was overpriced and could\'ve been way better (our beef wasn\'t even warm at service!). Not bad food, but also not something I would return for. Also, thankfully we weren\'t really hungry as the portions are on the smaller side. ‚òπÔ∏è *Entertainer: 1-1 main course, 1-1 cheers (use up to 1 voucher for every 2 persons dining)
Tom Yum Cereal Salmon.
Okay... I do like the rich dark brown color of the broth. Quite flavorful. The baked pork loin was my favorite among all the components. It was crispy, flesh firm and I could savor all the spices that went into it. The thinly sliced fried fish cakes were like crispy crackers which went so well with broth. The other element which was missing were the clams. Reason given was the clams were not fresh therefore it was not added. Rather disappointing.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />It was quite a \"gloomy\" lunch not because the food is not good. It was just that there were no smiles and no feel of \"friendly\" vibes. Perhaps they were too busy?? Oh well... at least I got to try their new offering.

This was one of my fave dish of the night. üëç #burpple
This was an ok dish, I could do without. #burpple
Amazingly fresh and seared to perfection.  #burpple
Never thought the nutty flavour could bring out the sweetness and freshness of the scallops. Bacon brought about an extra depth to the dish, and the apple serves to refresh the palate. Clams with ginger honey sauce, roasted pork and toasted bread. The sauce is out of this world, it feels like a whole pig was sacrificed for this. Bread soaks up the juice so deliciously. Such a scrumptous start and a sinful beginning to the dinner. #heaven #jizz #died #foodgasm #sgfoodporn #guiltypleasures
