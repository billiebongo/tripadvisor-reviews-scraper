Amazing spread across 16 stations - fantastic grill, cheeses, seafood on ice, suckling pig, whole hay-roasted lamb, Peranakan and Malay specialties, desserts, etc - to be enjoyed leisurely over four hours with free flow Verve Clicquot and cocktails.

From German Pork Knuckles, to Chinese Roasted Delights, to Peranakan spicy stir-fries, to Tandoori Salmon, to our local Chilli Crab with Mantou, The Edge offers a more extensive spread across various types of cuisine in comparison to several other hotel buffets. However, there is no one dish that I felt was really worth binging for. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable dinner. Diet starts tmr!
Price: $78\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Promenade ‚Ä¢\n<br />Have you eaten so full and realised that you have not finished the buffet section. While this is what I experienced @edge pan pacific. ‚Ä¢\n<br />They have wide range of selection, from seafood to Local satay and puff pastry soup (Remember to curry fish head from the waiter!). Not forgetting the wide range of dessert and waffles! ‚Ä¢\n<br />My personal favourite would definitely be their satay. Their mutton was sweet and succulent. Most importantly, there isn\'t mutton aftertaste. ‚Ä¢\n<br />I missed my opportunity to try the highly raved cheese raclette üôÉ. As it is only available for their Sunday brunch buffet. Edge is definitely the top of my list for buffet. ‚Ä¢\n<br />Ps: if you are a pan-pacific member, you can enjoy 4 for the price of 3 for their weekday dinner buffet and 10% for Mon to sat lunch and dinner buffet. The membership is free!

If you\'re planning brunch, try #PanPacificSingapore #Edge\'s refreshed Sunday Champagne Brunch. Spread is insane, but good thing is you have 4hours to conquer all the stations.
Perfect for lovers of any type of food, including them carnivorous people (ME), crustacean lovers (think lobsters, oysters) and the sweet tooth would be excited to find out the cray amounts of desserts and pastries they offer!
An interesting new item I spotted among the spread is the Crustacean Pot Pie. Revealing what is inside the pot is the luscious seafood bisque that is both comforting and hearty.
However if you like cheese and can eat a lot of it like one of my friends, go to Edge at @panpacificsingapore for their Sunday Brunch.
There\'s just so much to choose from from their 7 \'live\' food theatres, 16 stations and 3 cocktail bars! The good news: their brunch runs from 12pm-4pm every Sunday, so you can take your time.\n<br />-\n<br />$118 per adult with unlimited fresh juices, soft drinks and coffee/tea, $178 for unlimited @VeuveClicquot Brut Yellow Label, wines and beers, or $198 for Veuve Clicquot Ros√©.
She saw that I have almost everything chocolate except the Canel√© and Mini Lemon and Passion Fruit Tart. The most yummy is the 3 different type of Nama Chocolates in the middle. You got to open the chilled display fridge to get it. Addictive.
Which one? Hehe.... Part of the desserts at the Edge Buffet at @panpacificsingapore
Also, chose this picture because chef is very amused with me being very excited with the burger. I think he meant to tell me, SHUT UP AND EAT.
I didn\'t manage to eat 2/3 of the desserts. Too many things!
Lovely pastas at one of the live stations at @panpacificsingapore The Edge. Their duck tortellini is super on point too.
Eggs done any way, free flow lobsters, oysters, prawns, foie gras, sashimi and all of our local delights! Possibly one of the best brunch buffet experiences I\'ve had with that extensive choices!
Drank and ate way too much but this is simply the best way to start the week. üòçüòç
Edge at Pan Pacific boasts seven live theatres showcasing Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai, Japanese and Pan Pacific\'s signature \"Pacific Cuisine\". Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg 
The Sunday champagne brunch buffet at Pan Pacific is awesome. The seafood were so fresh. The prawns and lobster were so sweet. Service was ok. There a strong difference between service receive by a Caucasian family and me ( Asian). Did not want to stereotype but no one bother to check on us and we need to ask to be serve. Other than that, staffs were responsive when we called. Worth a try for $210 per pax. 
The first thing to do upon arriving here is to try and snag the table with a view of the Singapore flyer. Then, begin your adventure with Edge\'s seven live food theatres. Spoil yourself with some tandoori chicken, sashimi of all kinds, super tasty satay, freshly shucked oysters, roast beef and even dim sum! You\'d be glad to know that despite the vast variety, the quality remains high. Their dessert spread would make any child wide-eyed with Nyonya kuehs, pastries, ice cream, brownies and a live station for crepes and waffles. On weekdays (from $48 for lunch or from $68 for dinner), Edge offers various buffets with a focus that differs from day to day. Champagne brunch is served on Sundays ($178). 
Because who says we can\'t have desserts first before mains? Especially when the desserts are this attractive! 
I\'m not sorry to say I\'m no hawker food fan (why should anyone be sorry about their dining preference anw) but that Tai Lok Mee at the live station at Edge @panpacificsingapore had me finish the entire plate and more! Read about Makan Makan, their Saturday Lunch Buffet with upsized local flavors. Www.ms-Skinnyfat.com active link in bio!
Not self-serve, request from the dessert server like the ice creams. Very rich and authentic. My sister ate a few portions and on the drive back, she burped and I was frantically looking around and asked WHY GOT DURIAN SMELL #üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is the holy grail sashimi station for many buffet goers, a delicacy that I sadly (not really) do not partake. I like how they wrote my name on a plate to mark my reservation at a very nice table in an enclave. My table was number 88. I feel compelled to buy lottery now.
Perhaps Singapore\'s most amazeballs brownie. Crackly edges with a moist, fudgy centre. I\'ve been known to demolish entire trays at a go. I think the dessert chefs are afraid of me. :/
Here\'s my major international meat platter with chicken tikka, prawn masala, ikan assam pedas, chicken satay, pan seared duck breast and red snapper, and roasted chicken breast. Die lah.
Carbs really speak to me
Nice mix of soft and hard cheeses, with quite a wide array of dried fruit and crackers to go with.
|\n<br />For those who love sashimi and steak, you will love this place. You need to ask for fatty salmon sashimi because they were not been display. The steak and roasted beef was perfectly done (lightly char on the outside and juicy in the inside) .\n<br />|\n<br />Personally I found that their dessert wasn\'t as good as the Line but the durian congee was more than awesome! .\n<br />|\n<br />Now for the downside, they displayed excellent service at the start. But after an hour, I need to clear the table on my own and from that point, the service just went down slope. (They were not even full house)
With a wide array of cuisine from the Mediterranean, South East Asia, Middle Eastern, Asia and Western, one will be spoilt for choice here. A bit pricey on the dollar side (Weekend Dinner around $70++) but it\'s all worth it with the quality and variety of food served. Definitely lived up to its reputation for being one of the best buffets in Singapore. 
Loved the sea perch fillet at Hai Tien Lou at @panpacificsingapore Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio!
My category was BEST BUFFET, and the contenders are all strong.
The Edge has both, and it\'s satay is indeed one of the tastiest I had in a buffet setting.
Start with the desserts first. That\'s becos u would be first to have them!
They have a wide range of cakes, nonya kuehs, chocolates (!!!) and ice cream! Did I mention that they also have a waffle section with plentiful of spreads?!?!?! 
Some snippets of tonight\'s buffet dinner 
At the massive 4 hr Edge @panpacificsingapore champagne brunch right now. Amazing selection and a super long brunch session.
The mutton ones surprisingly is my fav compared to the beef and chicken. #aLongLongLunch
Freshly made waffles with vanilla bean ice cream and all sorts of spreads and sprinkles. #amateurplating
It is a unique brunch with a smorgasbord of sights, smells, sounds, tastes and textures of cuisines from around the Pacific Rim. Must try their lightly marinated, nicely charred and juicy satays. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/sunday-champagne-brunch-at-edge-pan-pacific/
They basically took everything from the buffet table. #restaurantweeksg #theedge #foodporn
The foie gras station is no doubt a definite highlight of @PanPacificSingapore\'s new @VeuveClicquot champagne brunch. Easily overlooked is their dainty mason jars of luscious foie gras mousse topped with various homemade jams.
Plate was too small. Couldn\'t load all the desserts I wanted in one serving. \n<br />Gluten-free red velvet cake and brownie were TO. DIE. FOR. Cheesecake was lovely. Watch out for the yuzu chocolate tart, filled with lusciously rich ganache and tempered with citrusy yuzu. \n<br />#dessert #cake #macarons #brownie #sweet #sugarhigh #buffet #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
One of the highlights of the champagne brunch buffet: SUCKLING PIG. Irresistibly succulent flesh padded with creamy fat, and to top it off, crispy skin that crunched so satisfyingly between my teeth. And if that\'s not already a perfect 10, the sweet, nutty sauce would make up the gap, seamlessly. \n<br />#sucklingpig #pork #meat #foodporn #buffet #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Sushi, sushi, sushi! There are also five types of sashimi (not pictured) offered. \n<br />#sushi #japanesefood #buffet #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Duck Confit Ravioli in Truffle Cream. Al dente parcels of salty shredded duck smothered in a rich, fragrant sauce - so yummy I just had to have seconds! \n<br />#ravioli #pasta #truffle #buffet #brunch #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Still cannot get over all the gorgeous desserts from this afternoon\'s Veuve Clicquot Champagne Brunch at Edge. If you are interested, it\'s $158++ per person every Sunday featuring traditional roasts, crustacean on ice, freshly-made pasta, 30 types of cheese and 20 varieties of dessert accompanied by unlimited booze from 12-4pm ‚ò∫Ô∏è @PanPacificSingapore
Abso-finger lickin\'-lutely scrumptious Spanish suckling pig. Other highlights include the succulent Omi Wagyu, spread of oysters and crustacean on ice and an elaborate dessert station.

Great idea from @thehungrycow to add Sio Bak to the bowl of Laksa.
Looking forward to the weekend. Have you make plans for it?
Pardon my ignorance but I don\'t deal well with buffet lines and my failure to even surpass 2 hours in an overindulging session makes me the worst kind of companion for sessions such as these
Could not resist picking up a few of them to try.

(I\'ve got a weakness for desserts.)
I don\'t usually rave about buffets, but this is definitely one you should try. The Nama chocolate was omg. Better than Royce. $118/pax without the champagne.
GRILLED MUSSELS served on a hot pan with a side of what could be delicious sambal chili. Mussels were cooked to perfection, almost \'fluffy\' while retaining its moisture. I would have scoured the ocean for these were they not to be delivered promptly to my table üòòüòú .

After 4 buffets this summer, my friends and i were disappointed with what we had at the edge. The ambience was good, but we found that the seafood is not as fresh as what we could find at other places. The service staff was not of a 5 star hotel standard as well. The only plus point of our visit was probably the durian pengat.
Must-tries include the return-worthy Fisherman Stew filled to the brim with flavour, clams, prawns and mussels, Seafood Paella and Edge\'s signature Fish Head Curry--spicy but shiok!
Jom, let\'s makan!
this is the famed candy crush cake due to the chefs love for the game candy crush. \n<br />supposedly de best buffet currently in town. erm maybe?
Love their spread of seafood, so fresh!
A bit pricey on the dollar side (Weekend Dinner around $70++) but it\'s all worth it with the quality and variety of food served. Definitely lived up to its reputation for being one of the best buffets in Singapore. Happy 21st to my baby sister! Wishing you good luck for your studies and future.
