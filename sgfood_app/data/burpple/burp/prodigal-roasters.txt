Went for some coffee and saw this available so as well get one to have a bite to go along. Really quite impressed by the brownie here; the exterior so crisp and the interior so fudgey and rich that it\'s bound to set one on a sugar high (not that I mind at all) and definitely one that sends one up to chocolate heaven. The melted S\'mores are part of the catch too ‚Äî still gooey and sticky without being too cloyingly sweet. Really finding myself liking the freshly-baked sweets here!
Cappuccino ($4) with its rich chocolaty taste, and Latte ($4.50), Accompanied by a slice of rich cheesy with a hint of umami taste Miso Cheese Tart ($4.50).\n<br />Available at @ProdigalRoasters which just opened last Friday. |\n<br />|\n<br />Prodigal Roasters \n<br />Address üè† : Blk 625 Ang Mo Kio Ave 9, # 01-112, Singapore üá∏üá¨ 560 625\n<br />Tel ‚òéÔ∏è : 9450 0484\n<br />Open üíà : \n<br />Sun - Fri : 8am - 7pm\n<br />Sat : 8am - 3pm\n<br />MRT üíà : Yio Chu Kang (NS15)\n<br />Note üìù : Currently no chairs, although some would be coming in later.
This minimalist coffee joint looks like it belongs in Duxton or within the CBD, instead of a far out neighbourhood suburb that is a good 10-minute walk from Yio Chu Kang MRT Station. So if you find yourself in the neighbourhood, make the most out of it and have your coffee, tea and even squeeze in a small snack here. The Prodigal Roasters (by prodigal they mean wastefully extravagant in giving), keep their prices super pocket friendly and nothing costs over $5 here. They use Panama beans that are roasted in-house ‚Äî these are also sold in packs of 250g ($15). The strictly standing-only shop has a narrow wooden counter for you to enjoy your cup of joe, but that shouldn\'t deter you from ordering their home made bakes. Everything looks and taste good here, especially the savoury Miso Cheese Tart ($4.50), which comes drizzled with a glossy brown miso sauce. \n<br />Avg price: $5 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
The long black has a fruity and bright profile. I like that it had the aftertaste of chinese tea when the long black has cooled down a little. Certainly something refreshing for me!Gosh, finally there is excellent coffee in the north(a short 10 minutes walk from Yio Chu Kang station)!\n<br />#EileenWantsToCampHereForever #SgCafe #Coffee #ProdigalRoasters #CoffeeArt #Burpple #Burpproved
Back here for the morning cuppa and we were served with beans of Panama origin but roasted differently from another batch from the ones I had on Saturday. Today\'s cuppa is rather different; a more nutty, chocolatey sort of flavour profile that is smooth and creamy. Quite my type of cuppa actually!
From Prodigal Roasters, a new hole-in-the-wall cafe beneath a HDB void deck near Yio Chu Kang MRT Station with a standing bar concept (no seats here, but there is a long counter table on one side). Apart from serving coffee, they also sell tea and cold-pressed juices alongside small bites such as tart slices and Belgium Waffles. Miso Cheese Tart was delicious though some might find salty (not me though); cheesy curd held by the crust which falls apart nicely without causing a mess with a savoury Miso sauce drizzled over; very alluring. Prodigal Roasters roast the coffee beans they use by themselves, and my Flat White was brewed from beans from Panama; well-balanced, creamy, fruity with a medium body without leaving and aftertaste with its clean finish. Definitely a place I would drop by again in the future if I need a simple coffee break. They also retail their roasted beans in 250gm packs at $15 each.
It‚Äôs like a latte in an iced glass? That‚Äôs the description I got.
The dense and unctuously creamy - coffee beans from Burundi and roasted by themselves.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#coffee \n<br />#coffeetime \n<br />#coffeelover \n<br />#coffeeaddict \n<br />#caffeinated \n<br />#sg \n<br />#merlioncitylife \n<br />#espresso \n<br />#sglife \n<br />#burpple \n<br />#cafehopping

Prodigal Roasters has put their Cold Brew into their menu ‚Äî there are options for 2 shots, 3 shots and 4 shots of espresso in their bottled cold brew; the Magic being the 2 shots variant. A pretty milky and creamy concoction with a light, nutty finish ‚Äî pretty intrigued with how the other two variants would taste like especially with the additional shots of espresso.
It\'s light but palate pleasing üòå

I liked how the tangy zing complements the savoury cheese base. Pair it with a cuppa flat white, and you\'ve got the perfect afternoon perk-me-up\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #hungrygowhere #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #8dayseats #sgig #igsg #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #tslmakan #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #burpple #burpplesg #exsgcafes #setheats #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodsteps #sgigfood #sgmakandiary #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #exploresingapore #singaporeinsider
.\n<br />We tried their Miso Cheese Tart ($4.50), which did not disappoint. The subtle taste of cheese was given a touch of sweetness by the caramelised miso glaze - I only wish I had more of it! My other favourite is the Raspberry Frangipane Tart ($4.50). It was moist with a cake-like texture and slightly grainy reminding me of a coconut almond macaron. Wash it down with a smooth cup of Cappuccino ($4) for a simple morning tea. .\n<br />.\n<br />Prodigal Roasters\n<br />Blk 625, Ang Mo Kio Ave 9, S560625\n<br />Full review: eatbook.sg/prodigal-roasters \n<br />Writer / Photographer: @heytheredreamer

I have fond memories of Madeleines; it\'s one of those things that my parents would buy from Delifrance for supper (that\'s the only reason for them to appear at Delifrance anyway) when I was still a small kid ‚Äî there is a love-hate relationship however; I liked the vanilla fragrance, but I never liked how jelat they can get for how oily they can be. Surprised to find these retailing at $2 each at Prodigal Roasters; get them served to you heated up so you get the crusty edges which gives the Madeleine a little crisp. Inside; fluffy, light and subtle aroma of vanilla exudes within ‚Äî very delightful for a light morning breakfast.

It is topped with smores that was added into the brownie during the baking process!
