Through the open-concept kitchen (the glass panels were a nice touch to prevent diffusion of food smells onto guests) we watched in fascination, as the chef began to build the pie from scratch before popping it into the dome-shaped wood-fired oven.

Rich and delicious, particularly loved the handmade pappardelle pasta and the slow-braised lamb shoulder ragout. Nuff said, will gladly order this again!
Pulpo (octopus) is found on Cicheti\'s specials menu. I enjoyed slicing the whole piece into smaller cuts, while my hunger increases proportionately. Especially liked how well the meat went with the hot chili pepper paste and olive oil. I\'ll order this again! 
Totally lived up to its intriguing name with a distinctive smokiness. The cheesecake itself was already scrumptious in all the ways a good cheesecake should be, but the element of smoke gave it an edgy dimension. 
Apart from the outer rim of the cookie crust pie being a bit hard, this was lovely. The almond paste filing was dense, really aromatic and rich. Plus I am a sucker for anything served with a cumulus of chantilly cream.
I thought the smoked duck was a tad salty but I guess it\'s the nature of the meat. Thankfully, the creamy tomato sauce managed to offset that quite nicely. It was the rigatoni however, that captured my attention most. It\'s what al dente perfection tastes like.\n
That white ball of air-flown Burratina is a mass of pure indulgence being indecently creamy and lava-like in the middle. Nothing frames it better than a dash of balsamic vinegar, savoury Beretta parma ham, fresh arugula and sugary sweet baby tomatoes. Pile the lot on the crunchy pieces of toast and get ready to take a bite of heaven.
I think it\'s brilliant of Chef Aun to substitute the usual romaine lettuce with kale. Beautifully crisp, the deep green curly vegetable with its high content of vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, took the classic Caesar salad to a whole other level of healthiness as well. Crunchy garlic croutons and oodles of shaved Grana cheese boosted the savoury factor further. Lending some all-important softness to the dish was a perfectly cooked 4-minute egg.  
It was good but not as good as the pizza here. 
Handmade,fresh pappardelle pasta served with slow-braised lamb shoulder ragout simmered with porcini mushrooms, and shaved with pecorino cheese
This starter of pan-seared scallops on a bed of truffled cauliflower pur√©e, served with squid ink crostini was a chef\'s special. I loved the cauliflower pur√©e! The subtle sweetness and aroma of the cauliflower paired so well with the truffle oil. Well, there aren\'t many things that don\'t go well with truffle oil. üòâ I mopped up every bit of pur√©e with Cicheti\'s signature smoky crostini - with a twist. Yum! While the scallops weren\'t super huge, they were fresh and cooked beautifully.
The panna cotta is rich and creamy, and firm but melts in the mouth. Topped with lots of vanilla bean, a tangy berry compote and crushed almonds, this classic offering had texture, taste and I\'m loving the rustic presentation.
The chef really does know how to extract the goodness from seafood cause this pasta was just exploding with the sweetness of whatever swims! I\'m not the biggest fan of seafood so this became a little heavy for me, but seafood lovers should rejoice at the freshness and generous amount of seafood in this pasta. And doesn\'t this look exotic? The seaweed lookalikes are deep fried vegetables that gave the pasta a satisfying crunch.
Cicheti has undergone some changes to its menu, with the burratina becoming a permanent fixture. Sadly, the mind-blowing meatball tagliatelle is off the menu :( luckily, the meatballs are still available as a starter. I found the meatballs to be firmer this time, and missing the aroma of truffle oil. But these generously sized meatballs were no less satisfying paired with that robust pomodoro and shaved grana. 
Yummy pizza which we all could tell that fresh ingredients were used!! Soooo excellent to the very last bite. We ordered another portion after this! 
This is a lot bigger than most lava cakes I have come across. The molten chocolate within does not disappoint either - it flows like one of our famous Singapore flash floods üòù With pink sea salt flakes incorporated into it, you get a interesting, nuanced flavour experience that plays tricks on your tastebuds, peekaboo-ing between sweet and salty. It\'s perfect partner in crime was a big scoop of vanilla gelato.
Having already eaten three of their pizzas and craving more, we were busy discussing which other type to get when the manager told us they had a special pizza for the day. Obviously that got us curious enough to order it. After having a bite, we unanimously agreed we\'d made the right decision.\n<br />Unlike most pizzas with a tomato sauce base, this didn\'t have that, which makes it a \"white pizza\". Pieces of grilled eggplant, cheese and a killer homemade pesto sauce were spread across the beautiful chewy Napoli style crust. It might sound simple but believe me, our sighs of pleasure were audible across the room.
Taking the honeycomb trend beyond soft serve yogurt and ice-cream, and putting a spin on it is Cicheti. You can now ask for additional topping of organic honey for their Quattro Formaggi pizza at only $2. I highly recommend it as the honey tastes absolutely divine with the strong flavours of the four cheeses. 
Love this so much!!! Lovely warmed toasted bread with salad and grapes~ üòçüòçüòç
One cheese not enough? No problem, have four. All laid out on a most glorious pizza crust. What a medley of creamy, oozy, salty and yes, even stinky goodness! A must-order if you love your cheese.
I took a shine to this salad which was one of the specials of the day. In spite of appearances, it proved to be really substantial because playing hide-and-seek among the salad leaves were four thick, large slices of sweet roasted pumpkin. I couldn\'t get enough of the seductive buttery flavour that permeated the entire salad (I don\'t cook but I\'m guessing butter was slathered freely all over the pumpkin before roasting). Oh, and there was plenty of their housemade crunchy caramelised mixed nuts, which endowed the salad with such an interesting texture.
You cannot believe how excited I was to be finally dining at Cicheti! After raving to my bf for weeks (all your fault, burpplers for your super tempting reviews!) and a failed visit cause the restaurant was already full, we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for our anniversary. :D Also made sure that the Burratina was available. Our meal did not disappoint and we loved every single dish ordered. Will definitely be back! Oh and btw, here\'s my prosecco, which was sweet and bubbly and not too strong, perfect for refreshing my palate between the scrumptious courses :) 
Wanted to order the creme br√ªl√©e initially, but the server told us that it isn\'t served with candied bacon anymore. So we decided to order this, which had candied bacon! Ironically, the smokiness of the bacon overshadowed the other elements of this otherwise wonderful dessert. So we ostracized the bacon and enjoyed the crisp, buttery yet zesty brioche (almost like a butter cookie except softer!) that went really well with the tangy compote and vanilla ice-cream. Tied up our meal very well. :)
These meatballs were so good. So tender and juicy that they fell apart with a prick of my fork, these meatballs were flavourful, meaty and hid a surprise touch of truffle fragrance that complemented the sweetness of the meat instead of overpowering it. :) The fresh, handmade pasta was also impressive - cooked perfectly al dente and had a really lovely bite. This was comforting flavours taken to a whole new level. I\'m definitely going back for all the handmade pastas! 
Prawns were fresh and nicely cooked. While the herb butter sauce was not fiery as claimed (and I\'m no chili-eating pro), it was INTENSELY fragrant! A little oily to mop up with the crostini on the side, but we did so anyway. :b
This was an explosion of flavours! Creamy burrata with prosciutto, arugula tossed in a light citrusy vinaigrette, with candied almonds that are crisp and so so fragrant. The warm poached nectarines were juicy and mildly sweet with a touch of salt, and helped balanced the saltiness of the prosciutto. The bread on the side was toasted perfectly, adding a delicious smokiness to the whole dish. You gotta try this if it\'s available!
Yummy and must try for this dessert!! Rich in chocolate but sweetness is just right as the salt calmed it down. 
This was another of the day\'s delicious specials. Credit must be given for the way they managed to transform the pasteurised crabmeat and make it taste so good. I like how they layered textures in this dish with florets of crisp broccolini and a light blanket of spicy breadcrumbs too.
After our heavy dinner at Cicheti, I was feeling too stuffed to accommodate anything else, so I\'d initially waved off the attempts by our friendly waitress Eunice to have us order dessert. But that smart young lady cajoled us into ordering this unusual dessert and it was everything she promised it would be - aromatic, light, cool and refreshing. How could it not when the jelly was infused with thyme, mint and sage, and then topped with shaved ice made from Grappa and sugar? Livened up further with fresh oranges and candied orange peel, it closed our evening of brilliant food with a fresh flourish. 
A symphony of tomato and fresh seafood, this is one of the more impressive Choppino\'s I\'ve come across. Tomato-based, the consistency falls somewhere between a soup and a stew, and features lots of my favourite herb, basil. In terms of seafood, it is a case of quality over quantity, with generously sized, superbly fresh pieces. I especially like that they grill the fish before adding it on so it doesn\'t get mushy or break apart.
I would go so far as to say this is the BEST rendition of a Burratina (also known as Burrata) salad I have had in years.\n<br />Besides the top-notch silky-smooth, creamy Burratina cheese and clean-tasting Parma Ham, the other ingredients seem to be above the ordinary too, thanks to the chef\'s efforts in making them from scratch. This includes the grilled bread (on which the cheese rests), the candied almond slices (which adds a fantastic sweet and salty crunch factor) and the luscious poached pears. Even the rocket leaves are the fresh, young and succulent variety, coated lightly in a perfectly balanced house-made dressing. \n<br />With this being one of the \"Day\'s Specials\", there is no guarantee it\'s available all the time. But if it happens to be when you are there, I highly recommend ordering it.
Cicheti\'s authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas have a remarkably spotted crust and are topped with their homemade tomato sauce. They\'re rustic, loaded with fresh, quality ingredients, and baked in a massive wood-fired oven (suspended from the ceiling!), making them ever so flavourful. Go for the Margherita and Diavola; you won\'t be disappointed. Plus points for Cicheti\'s very charming space.
Being an Italian restaurant with its own pizza oven, the panini bread for the sandwiches here is actually freshly-baked Neapolitan-style pizza crust! Isn\'t that clever? :) The thin, fabulously smoky crust (with just the right amount of scorch-marks) is first slathered with Greek yogurt before being used to cradle large chunks of grilled chicken and salad. A mixed herb marinade for the chicken also means that the moist and tender meat is really delicious. This is easily one of the most memorable sandwiches I have had in Singapore.
Having witnessed the meatballs being made by hand on a previous visit, I had high expectations when I ordered this. Suffice to say, there were no regrets. They were indeed firm and juicy in their meaty goodness. The pile of spagetti with which they were served was cooked al dente. The rich tangy tomato sauce that held everything together was deeply scented with fresh basil leaves. 
The pizza crust at Cicheti is soooo good, I\'d even eat it on its own. Loaded with quality ingredients, it becomes even more unforgettable. We had the Bismark, Carbonara and Quattro Formaggi, and all three were delicious. I must say though, the Carbonara edged out the others as my favourite as it had bacon :) The sole salad on the lunch menu proved to be the perfect accompaniment to our rich pizzas.
Sweet and savoury works well in this dessert. The cold, slightly firm egg custard has a deep richness, and it comes with a crisp maple-caramel layer on the top. Across that crystallized terrain are pieces of salty bacon crumble partially hidden under a flurry of icing sugar snow. Together, they form an interesting and enjoyable combination.
The chef sure knows how to coax all the prawn flavour out of the fresh-from-the-market prawns because this dish is packed with the powerful essence of the crustaceans. Cooked in olive oil with sweet baby tomatoes and chilli, the two plates we ordered for sharing, went down well with everyone at the table. All too swiftly, they were slurped up. 
Why are the pizzas here so good? I have a feeling it\'s got plenty to do with the person whose skillful hands craft each Neapolitan-style pizza with deftness and passion. Oh, and the wood-fired oven helps of course :)
The chocolate tasted amazing and the cake had just the right amount of undone-ness but after 2 starters, 2 pizzas, a pasta and 2 desserts, we found it a little gelat.
This was a daily special and raved about by our server - A layered panna cotta (berry flavoured at the top and citrus at the bottom) topped with strawberries, raspberries, candied orange peel and crushed pistachios. Very good and innovative.
The better pizza! The buffalo cheese was firm and the tomato sauce was really really flavourful. Not too watery as well.
The standout dish of the night - there really is a difference between dried and freshly-made pasta! Kudos to the chef; the noodles were perfectly al dente and springy. The lamb ragu was tender and came apart easily. Would go back just for their pasta.
\"Beef meatballs sauteÃÅed in a slow-cooked tomato sauce, topped with shaved grana\" - this was a solid dish, very hearty homemade meatballs doused in a thick, rich and flavourful tomato sauce.
The bread was made in-house; soft but tasted a little off. A for effort though. The tomatoes were incredibly sweet and juicy!
I didn\'t realise my finger was in the picture :/
Really good food and an intimate ambiance makes for a perfect date night. Cicheti (Chi-keh-tee), located along Kandahar St, serves perfect woo-fired pizzas and hearty pastas. Have the Bruschetta to start, then move in the Bismarck, a crispy pizza topped with a gorgeous runny egg, the pappardelle ragu, and the delectable ciopino. The ambiance just right, not too stiff and not too casual, with excellent service. 
Crema Bruciata. Talk about strange desserts, this here is a frozen creme br√ªl√©e with a burnished maple syrup glaze and pierced with candied bacon -- it\'s like a warped dessert take on bacon and eggs. #bacon #candied #cremebrulee #dessert #sgfood #sweet #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Tagliatelle Carne. Looks like mee pok, but this handmade tagliatelle served al dente with saut√©ed minced beef balls in a rustic homemade tomato sauce is way better! #tagliatelle #pasta #beef #meatballs #tomato #italianfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Gamberi Grassi. Best part of this spicy prawn tapas was dipping the crostini in the herb butter sauce - delish!! #prawns #crostini #spicy #italianfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Pomodori Secchi. Really liked this garlic bruschetta with ricotta spread and semi-dried tomatoes - it had a faint smokiness from the grill. #bruschetta #bread #tomatoes #foodporn #italianfood #sgfood #ilovemyjob
The Bismark is topped simply with cheese, ham, mushrooms and an egg, but it was a party of flavours in my mouth. üéá I loved the abundant pools of fior de latte (buffalo mozzarella), which when swirled with the runny yolk, yielded a luxurious, creamy, fragrant, amazing mess. The mushrooms were also delish, their earthy fragrance lifting the richness of the cheese and egg. I wish I knew how Cicheti prepared these shrooms. üòã Not to forget, the signature pizza crust which was light and slightly chewy. So good!
The classic seafood pizza done really well, as usual. This one had prawns, squid and scallops on a red base. The seafood was very fresh and its natural sweetness and brininess flavoured the pizza perfectly. I was also really impressed by the perfect doneness of the various seafood. Everything was tender and succulent. üòãüòã
The must-have every time I visit Cicheti. This time it didn\'t come with grilled pear, but the star really was that tender ball of mozzarella and cream. I liked how Cicheti deviated from the usual way of serving burrata (ie with prosciutto, vine tomatoes and rocket). Though I sometimes miss the vine tomatoes, I felt that the myriad of flavours and textures from the toasted pistachios, pesto and onion marmalade in Cicheti\'s version tasted better. Also, there was nothing better than a magic carpet ride on the smoky grilled crostini for my fave cheese.
Amazing tomato crabmeat squid ink pasta with a bit of a spicy kick to it, and that kale topping! üòö Star of the show was definitely the medium rare wagyu steak, it went so well with just a tad of sea salt and Parmesan cheese savings. ü§ó Hello Friday! \n<br />#sgfood #pizza #pasta #wagyu #burpple

Not impressed 
Tomato based pizza, mozarella and parmesan cheeses topped with ham,bacon,mushroom and runny egg yolk in the middle. Nice!
Too hungry (and dark) to take photo of the rest of the dishes. #foodporn #foodorgasm #addictions #nocturnalactivities #burpple
Comes with rucola salad, grapes, parma ham and toasted bread. An absolute steal at $28! #foodporn #foodorgasm #mindblown #burpple
Delicious :)
Suddenly missed Beach Road and Haji Lane.... #dinner #latergram #foodie #food #foodporn #foodcoma #sg #Singapore #Italian #love
Refreshing creation!
Fascinating dessert - delicious!
Pizza was flavorful and the ingredients were fresh.
Very tender and juicy.
Very fresh!
What a refreshing starter!
Give it a miss. Lol 
Light on taste and soggy. Make it a miss unless you are damn hungry or feeling too rich. 
The base was nice expect that it\'s a bit soggy in the middle cause of the soft egg. But yummy overall!! 
the super early dinner we had.. not so sinful afterall :x #nomnomnom #mycafediary #sgcafe #cafe #burpple #onthetable #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #filter #vscocam #YOLO

A little watery (from the cheese i think?) for my liking but otherwise pretty good
Semifreddo. Mascarpone with fresh berries, nougat and caramel in a jar. This is off the menu, so you have to specially ask for it if you want it! #semifreddo #berries #fruit #creamy #dessert #sweet #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Salted Chocolate. I wasn\'t expecting this to be quite so boldly salty, but I loved it anyway. #salty #sweet #chocolate #molten #lava #cake #dessert #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Herb Jelly Grappa. A sweet, floral jelly that reminded me of the osmanthus dessert you get at Chinese restaurants. #jelly #floral #flowers #sweet #dessert #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Cioppino. Could taste the sea in this rich seafood stew of fish, prawns, clams and squid. Loved the flavour, but the prawns and clams were overcooked. #cioppino #soup #stew #seafood #italianfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Pappardelle Ragu. Wide strips of handmade pasta coated in a flavourful slow-braised lamb shoulder ragout with porcini mushrooms and pecorino shavings. #pasta #lamb #pappardelle #ragout #italianfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Diavola. One of the best wood-fired pizzas I\'ve had - buoyant thin-crust generously smothered with rich, robust homemade tomato sauce and topped with mozzarella, parmesan, salame, chilli, garlic and basil leaves. #pizza #thincrust #woodfired #tomato #cheese #italianfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
