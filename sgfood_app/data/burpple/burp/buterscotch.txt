The chicken was a little bland but it balanced out with the mushroom sauce which was very thick and salty (there\'s a line between savory and salty). The coleslaw surprised me coz its a very unhealthy but delicious coleslaw. It\'s super duper creamy. I like it. Haha
When my knife went down the first cut, egg yolk oozed running down the salmon and toast, then I heard a crunchy crisp - it was the toast. One mouthful of awesomeness but sadly I was a little disappointed with the salmon. I would prefer a more smoky smoked salmon.
Unique flavours, as it was my first time trying &amp; i love the taste of it. 
the waffle was so fluffy-in-the-middle and infused with rich pandan flavour that I thought I was eating a pandan cake! the texture was more similar to cake, and I couldn\'t really relate to ondeh ondeh due to the miserable amount of coconut and gula melaka. \n<br />ondeh ondeh gives me the feeling that gula melaka will burst from within, which is a far cry from the waffle version.\n<br />nevertheless, it is still a comfort dessert because I love pandan! perhaps change the name to pandan waffles? üòÇ on a side note, the flu escalated since yesterday night. sucks when the mucus keeps flowing and your eyes felt like 10kg heavier üòì
Being one of the earliest cafe to open around Bukit Merah, Butterscotch started off selling bakes and then expanded to mains! The Raspberry Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.50+) contains layers of raspberry and chocolate topped with a slice of strawberry! The raspberry and chocolate are flavourful, thought it could have been more dense!
Special off-menu items: Fish &amp; Chips and Ondeh-ondeh waffles. Contrary to general negative reviews, the fish was actually crispy and flaky, very fresh and sweet. Way too much mayonnaise on that plate though. Lattes weren\'t great, kind of weak.
Have not posted in this category for a while now. I take that as an indication that I have reliable recommendations from my fellow burpplers on my food exploration. This cafe in the heartland was a little exploration down memory lane as I used to hang around Bukit Merah. However, I was really disappointed when their cakes were not fresh. Texture was dry and tough, obvious from leaving the sliced cake in the display fridge for too long. The prices are also over kill for their set up, which left us really really disappointed.
Neighbourhood Halal cafe nestled within Bukit Merah Central.
Not much of that ondeh-ondeh flavour, more like pandan with a hint of coconut. Plain vanilla ice-cream also didn\'t seem to live up to the name of the dish.
Overpriced for an average plate of chicken chop, eggs and potato wedges. 
The Churros served in Butterscotch is thick and has a distinct cinnamon fragrance. Read mkre: http://www.misstamchiak.com/20-halal-cafes-in-singapore/
The souffle was soft and light! The chocolate sauce and ice cream just add an extra oomph to it! Yummers!
You could never ask for anything more when you have BACON with french toast, bananas and maple syrup! 
Weekend special Root beer batter fish and chips. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth moist blanketed in the crunchy root beer batter. The taste of root beer is mild enough not to overwhelm the dish. The fries were the right texture of crunchy but otherwise pretty ordinary. $18+
The main dish comes in quite a big proportion for me. The salmon is fresh and the chicken chop was not overcook. I love the truffle fries! The buffalo wings however could be improve. I wish I had save some space for desserts! Definitely will come back again!
Souffle was under cooked and mushy, also tried the signature cookies and cream latte which was drown with syrup .. so darn sweet that I couldn\'t finish it.. definitely won\'t be returning here!
The souffl√© is light and fluffy, every spoonful is a delight. Enjoy it with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce and it will bring you to a whole new level of enjoyment. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
Can you imagine what will happen when Ramly and Wendy, two of the best fast-foods known for their beef burger, meet? Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
The souffle\'s moist and fluffly. Tried several items on their menu, food\'s pretty good. Serving size is quite generous.
Really loved the food here. Super good and just nice serving size. Will definitely come back for more. Walking distance from Bukit merah interchange
First and foremost, I\'m surprised to see a service charge but was given bad service (the contradiction) when I have to go to the counter not to have my order taken from where I\'m seated, I greeted \"hello\" but no answer at the counter by the man with back comb bronze dyed hair. He took my order with not much of enthusiasm. I ordered a few dishes like salmon poached eggs ( why is the side salad just lettuce with Mayo, it\'s a very typical Malay side instead of a good side of mix green salad with balsamic vinegar, no?)Ramly beef burger was salty, churros was okay, truffle fries and 3 drinks. To my disappointment, the egg yolks of the chicken chop dish were not consistent. The price do not conform with the quality of service and food.   
The meringue. I have to say that the presentation for this was well done. It tasted pretty decent too.
It did rise but felt it was a bit undercooked and runny inside. Overall, not a good experience and will not recommend the place.
And it did live up to what everyone said. First churro I had that was mushy inside. Do not recommend this.
The Souffl√® stood proud and tall and hot inside, dip into the chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream, it tastes well esp on a cold cosy day.
Can\'t forget what I\'m back for!!! The yummiest souffl√© that I tasted so far... 
2nd time back in Butterscotch eating the same food again and tastes still as good! A rather creative dish name for the menu.
The \"tall and proud\" signature butterscotch souffl√© from the cafe. For $14, you\'ll get the souffl√©, butterscotch ice cream n dark choc syrup. Did not disappoint at all! üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥üç¥
Small but packs a punch in flavour 
Set in an unsuspecting humble residential neighbourhood is this delightful litte cafe. Their menu may be limited but the taste of their dishes make up for that! Really generous\n<br />portions and food that leaves you very satisfied!
A small caf√© tucked in the suburbs of Redhill offers halal cafe foods. Their truffle fries are one of the best I\'ve tried with it properly seasoned.
One of their special in menus. I must say this is one of the best lasagna I have tasted to date(I don\'t really eat lasagna). Abit cheesy but their tomato sauce is rightly seasoned and perfected to pamper my tastebuds! Garfield would have loved it and I bet you would too!
Did I tell you I\'m a fan of latte art? Yes I was served upon this and saw that fern leaf foam. All in all this drink has got me wanting for more, but unfortunately I was full from all the eating. Priced at $5 you\'d never regret buying this!
I may be young but i know what love is. And this is it :)
This is the JAM yawwww! A partayyy in the mouth. Chocolate love and ice cream. Come on spread the love baybeh :)
Uh huh! Taking rvc to another level yaw! Woohoo!!! :)) But okay2 la...pretty dry though. 
My third visit to Butterscotch and it never disappoint me. Large serving of chicken chop and my all-time-order of the truffle fries. Worth the price for its large serving. They are other dishes as well. And not to forget, desserts.  
The food was beyond words. The desserts are spectacular. Can\'t get a seat when we first come. Had to be on waiting list until they call us abt 30 mins later i guess. But not disappointed at all! 
Juicy patty top with delicious sauce and marshroom on top of fluffy bun and generous portion of wedges.
Served in a metal plate with generous portion of every thing thats nice.
Unique mix of the local drinks to something that taste even better!
French toast with bacon, caramelized banana and maple syrup. Worth trying! üëç
Another cozy little cafe around bukit merah central.. It\'s halal too. :)
This was awesome for a sweet lover like me. And the chocolate syrup just add on to the flavor and sweetness.  This made me full. $12. üëç
Tasty for a non cheese lover. The cheese wasn\'t thick, it was smooth and it blends in nicely with raspberry. üëå
Warm and jiggly with an eggy interior. Chocolate dip was too sour for my liking, while the intense saltiness of the Salted Caramel ice-cream did not work well either.
Tasted seemingly plain and came nowhere close to being a Red Velvet Cake. Cake was however adequately moist with the right texture which was pleasant.
One of the few cafes that serve halal gourmet in their menu. Truly appreciate that. Quite filling, too.
Something different. Not often served in other cafes. Mix of hot and cold. Mildly sweet, just the way I like it.
Today\'s cafehopping venue. Love your drawings @amsyarstifler. üòÑ#butterscotchcafe #dessert #cafe

So lucky i got a Lunch Special, which means it only costs $15 for the Smoked Salmon Egg Bens (Initially $18) &amp; a cup of Ice Lemon Tea! Their Ice Lemon Tea is really pretty nice. Place a bit small but quite cozy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Saw this place somewhere online with some discounts going on so decided to give it a try. Order 3 drinks. The drinks were really expensive and unworthy. A can of root beer cost $4. Ordered tom yam goong linguine ($17) badly plated, the aftermath is what you see in the picture. The oil left on the plate despite I ate my linguine with the \"sauce\" was terrifying. I\'m not sure with its standard, it will even pass the singapore authorities. The buffalo wings are the wettest I\'ve seen. Basically it\'s simple, over deep fried wings poured with bottled bbq sauce. The chickens chops were super dry, black pepper sauce has a weird taste and charred flavor at the end. Terrible meal. I don\'t know how people can have good reviews about the food here. The service is bad too. Had to repeat my order countless times to the staff over the counter. 
Souffl√© with chocolate syrup!! $12+
Crispy and slightly chewy with a nice dark chocolate flavour
We ordered cappucino &amp; ice lemon tea. Both drinks were real good. Totally recommend them.
Churros are very oily. Chocolate dipping sauce is good though. Not worth ordering. On top of that,the lady serving the food to us had a very long sour face. It doesn\'t make customers feel welcome at all. We understand she might have a bad day but in the competitive service industry,it\'s the little things that count.
So fragrant and sweet! $12+ #openricesg #sgfoodies #sgcafefood #eatoutsg #yelp #yelpsg #burpple #burpplesg #singaporeinsider #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #i8mondays #8dayseat

Deep fried soft pastries rolled in sugar and cinnamon served with chocolatey-chocolate sauce. Yumzeh~! #halal 
Ending my meal with their Pavlova with fresh berries and strawberry puree. The meringue was baked really well and crispy. The fresh fruits and puree added sweetness to the dessert but there was a little too much whipped cream. 
Not much varieties when it comes to main course, but its quite filling. About $20/pax, not inclusive of dessert yet! Tried the Ramly meet Wendys burger with iced cookies and cream latte. Love the combination üòã
Awsome hehe great place for dessert üòÑ
‚Ä¢ Salmon Eggs Benedict ($16): Pretty good for the first few mouthfuls then you\'ll get sick of the hollandaise sauce. ‚Ä¢ Ramly Burger ($14): Don\'t expect too much from it. ‚Ä¢ Berries Palova ($12): THIS WAS THE BEST ONE OF THE MEAL! The meringue is so fluffy and light, it\'s so good to go for another one. ‚Ä¢ Chocolate Stacko Cake ($7/8?): It\'s good if you\'re a dark chocolate lover!  
The food was nice and big portion! 
Oh.my.gawd i love this. Don\'t really fancy the graham sandwich tho. Coming for more desserts such as butterscotch souffle.And bomb alaska. Verdict:4/5
This dish is sooo heavely. Really. Sweet maple syrup + caramelised banana and salty bacon, how perfect can a dish get? Verdict : 5/5

Many minah tudung here.  I like!
Try their signature churros! Apparently it\'s their popular order.
The eggs were not dry enough causing the bread to be quite mushy after awhile. Service was okay. Ambience was nice. A decent brunch indeed.
Butterscotch\'s signature churros. Crispy cinnamon roll with chocolate sauce for $10. 6 pieces a bucket.
