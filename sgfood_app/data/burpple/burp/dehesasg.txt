This dish took 45min to make from scratch till it was served. Perfectly grilled to the extent that each rib separated from the other easily. Best ribs we have ever eaten!!
A restaurant with open kitchen concept. This huge plate of paella (serves 2-3) was flavorful and every seafood was of such good quality.
Crispy Tripe ($14)
Seafood all in good order, but that squid ink paella was awfully salty ‚Äì as if it\'d been salted on top of all the oceanic brine already imbued in it. I don\'t think any of us managed to bring ourselves to swallow more than one bite of the rice üò£ .
I don\'t eat (pig) innards, nor do I like lamb, so it is quite astounding that I actually don\'t mind sweetbreads (lamb pancreas). Or maybe Dehesa just does such splendid work on these creamy bits of offal ‚Äì served here with baby-sized nibbles of ravioli ‚Äì that I just can\'t help but take a fancy to them.
The pommes fondant ‚Äî pillow-shaped potato slow-cooked in stock and butter ‚Äî break effortlessly with the pry of a fork and the smoked bone marrow-infused jus is a joy. Ok, that\'s all.
This slow-cooked Icelandic beauty awards you with such an orgasm-inducing texture that you just want more. Its signature richness is balanced gorgeously by the kohlrabi and green apple slices, both peppery and sweet notes subtly intertwine to cleanse the palate. Ok, that\'s all.
Meaty chunks of white fish, crisp slices of red onions, juicy bursts of cherry tomatoes, smooth richness of creamy avocado, and generous drizzles of lemon juice and olive oil. This is how you do ceviche. Ok, that\'s all.
The amber-hued spicy romesco sauce is an homage to tradition ‚Äî the sauce is typically paired with fish ‚Äî and it works terribly well with the croquettes. The pepper\'s subtle sweetness encapsulates the fish\'s smokiness gloriously. The pork crackling is a nice touch...adds texture and makes eating this dish even more fun. Ok, that\'s all.
YAAS! I don\'t know about you but I just want to sink my whole face into this plate. Ok, that\'s all.
Dessert from restaurant week! Slighter lighter than the chocolate tart, this is quite a pleaser. Especially enjoyed the confit fennel, which tasted a little orangey. Absolutely loved the honeycomb crunch that added a fine touch to the plate! 
Dessert from restaurant week menu. This was a little too rich for my liking, although I must say; it was really good. Pretty impressed with the textures at play here. Pity though, cause I couldn\'t get through the whole thing. Wish there was a more refreshing and lighter option! 
Main course from restaurant week. Loved this dish sooo very much. It is so packed with the richness of crustacean. And squid ink is thick and rice is literally soaked in it. Really amazing dish 
Main course for restaurant week! Didn\'t quite understand the dish.. Probably the most disappointing dish that seating.. Flavors were quite one dimensional and lacking of something like to elevate the dish 
Starter from restaurant week menu! Loved the generous portions of chunky crab meat, and the rich orange emulsion (can\'t quite make out what it is). This dish is very well conceptualized. Loved every bit of it!  
Starter from restaurant week menu! Super generous chunk of terrine with foie gras right smack in the middle. Well seasoned I\'ll say, with the correct level of saltiness, balanced by the creaminess of the foie. The chutney also provided a different flavor profile to the dish that cuts the heaviness of the dish. 
With celery leaves &amp; red peppers. Loved the citrusy touch to the dish and how tender the octopus pieces are! 
The Pulled Pork Sandwich features delicate shredded pork sandwiched in fluffy soft bun that is homemade as well.
Honestly, with that lardo on top and the vibrantly bouncy slices... Just go have it for yourself. Full review in bio! #burpple
The chef tells us he doesn\'t really like French toast, so instead this - brioche permeated with caramel, on a five spice infused plum sauce. Well if this is the alternative I don\'t like French toast either. 
Home made, rolled out of a little tumbler, and demurely beautiful. They know better than to overdo the pandan, so it\'s a caress instead of a slap. 
Dining at Dehesa, meaning \"grasslands\" in Spanish, is a wonderfully adventurous way to start the year. A strong contender in the nose-to-tail dining scene, this charming, intimate space along North Canal Road helmed by chef Jean-Philippe Patruno (formerly of Bomba Paella Bar and UNA) is perfect for special occasions and new experiences. Dive head first into their Platter of Cold Meats ($32), a generous assortment featuring pig\'s ears, homemade saussison, Fifi p√¢t√© (heart, belly, liver) and more. Prepare for a study in lesser known animal parts that will prove delightful ‚Äî from the intensely flavourful Crispy Pig\'s Head ($28) topped with a quivering egg yolk ravioli, to the warm Duck Hearts on Toast ($13) that feel surprisingly familiar and comforting. Don\'t miss the unbelievably tender Octopus ($28) draped lovingly in sheets of thin-as-air lardo, and balance the whole meal out with tart Cherry Tomatoes ($15) paired with refreshing fennel and creamy burrata. End off, as you must, with the classic Torijas ($14), a dessert of milk-soaked bread br√ªl√©ed to a crisp, served with plum compote and cr√®me fra√Æche. Be sure to come by with good friends and open minds, and don\'t forget to order a bottle of wine.
When there\'s pig\'s head on the menu, you\'d be silly not to order it. Cutting through this is like an essay on texture: first, the knife\'s deft pierce through thin ravioli skin releases a quivering egg yolk, then, a satisfying crunch through a crisp coat, and finally, the blade yields completely when it touches the lovingly braised and pulled pig\'s head. Every part of the head is in there, save for the eyeballs. Almost instantly, yolk meets meat, creating something far greater than the sum of its parts. If I had one way to describe it, I\'d call it \"essence of pig\" - almost like every pig dish I\'ve ever had put into one voluptuous, intense bite that etches itself into your taste bank, never to be forgotten. 
When your octopus dish doesn\'t require a knife to eat, you know you\'re onto a winner. Beautifully tender, with a gentle bite, these morsels of octopus come draped in the thinnest of Lardo slices, and atop roughly mashed Ratte potatoes. As the lovely server suggests, allow the glorious layer of pork fat to sit for just a minute, and let the octopus adopt a new skin. Delightfully simple, this was one of the best bites I\'ve had in a long time. Portions here are good for 4 to share!
‚Ä™#‚ÄéDehesaSG‚Ä¨ may have only opened mid-December, but it easily ascended into my #Bestof2015 list with chef-owner Jean-Philippe Patruno\'s focused menu of robustly-flavoured offal dishes and finessed ‚Ä™#‚ÄéSpanish‚Ä¨ classics. #readaboutitontheblog - http://six-and-seven.com/2015/12/dehesa-singapore/
Lunch / 5 Jan 2018: Catalonian traditional dish comprising of smoky grilled vegetables topped with a perfect soft boiled egg. Its one of the sharing plates on the menu - will highly recommend if you are in need of veg in this nose-to-tail dining establishment
This is a smooth one with a luscious cream center. Too good. @dehesa.sg
the dessert that look like art ! Splendid
The pork rib is surprisingly tender and ease to eat !
We love every single dish we ordered at this restaurant! Octopus was torched to perfect texture, stacked on top of the tasty mash, and topped with a really good type of cheese which we dk its name ):
Good! Good! Good! üò± Cow\'s stomach fried till crispy not rubbery accompanied with tangy romesco sauce, this is something you can munch on non-stop with beer üç∫üçª! Offal lovers will definitely find this seriously addictive!\n<br />.\n<br />üç¥\n<br />.\n<br />@dehesa_sg is a relatively new Spanish restaurant specializing in \'nose to tail\' dining. The chef was previously from various Michelin starred üåü restaurants. It\'s no wonder everything tasted so amazing!\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #dehesa #sgfoodie #instafood #foodphotography #sgfoodlover #fooddiary #foodstagram #foodieat #sgfoodlover #foodie #foodlover  #burpplesg #sgcafe #foodporn #offal #cow #tripe #fried
Dehesa\'s expertise is supposedly in the nose-to-tail department ‚Äì think ox heart and sweetbreads ‚Äì but what captivated me was the unassuming tortilla. Here, the Spanish classic features soft chunks of potato and jamon embedded in a slightly wet omelette and fried to a smoky, brown crisp on the surfaces. A generous slathering of piquant Romesco sauce (at least I think that\'s what it is) as the finishing touch made this utterly impossible to resist.
Ok, that\'s all.
And then celeriac pur√©e. Ok, that\'s all.
Ok, that\'s all.
Effortless eating...this should be a trend, right? Your fork goes in to pry a little and the meat just strings away easily. Ok, that\'s all.
Ok, that\'s all.
