Laksa // Prawn &amp; Pork Bone Broth. Laksa\'s broth not bad but would be better if it\'s spicer &amp; stronger coconut flavour. Love the prawn &amp; pork bone broth thou\'! 
Have had 6 cups in the past 1.5 hours and am still going strong. \n<br />#durian #puree #dessert #buffet #yum #burpple #sgfood #foodporn
