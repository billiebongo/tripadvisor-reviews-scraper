An off-the-menu special, the Spagetti Pescatora could very well trigger a squeal of delight from those who adore tomato sauce-based seafood.\n<br />Cooked in a silver foil bag, it is only unwrapped in front of you at the table. And although tomato sauces tend to look alike, this one brims with so much richness. I could taste olive oil and seafood stock in it. The prawns, squid and clams were really fresh too.
Squid ink fettuccine tossed with generous amount of fresh lobster in creamy tomato sauce. Simply magnificent! A must-try when visiting this fancy Italian fine-dining. 
Must have for pizza lovers! Loaded w copious amount of toppings and having an extremely thin, crisp crust makes it outstanding on it\'s own. Crust remains crisp even after some time, so you can take your time to savor it in between other dishes. 
Patty was pretty juicy, flavor and taste is robust w a heavy hand of smoked pepper. Portion is perfect if you want to have something light. 
This was mind-blowing!! I was in food heaven the whole time I was having it. The fettuccine and sauce was superb, huge chunks of fresh crab meat further complements and elevates the taste of it. Must order, must try. You\'ll never regret having it. 
Great for starters, a good combination of sweet and savory. You can never go wrong w this crowd pleaser.

Chantilly cream cake with profiteroles to celebrate a dear friend\'s birthday. 
This is one good pizza, topped with ham and mushrooms with a soft-cooked egg. 
Birthday eve dinner at Valentino with @pixietigre. We\'ve found our next fave Italian restaurant after La Cantina. #rachelis23not18
Portions for the mains have shrunk. Quality is top notch. Pasta is al Dante. Seafood is fresh. Portion definitely not enough for one male or a hungry female
Nice dose of truffle oil that is well balanced with the mushrooms and ravioli. Portion is a little too much for such rich food.
Interesting dish combo of squid ink pasta with tomato base gravy and soft buttery fish.
where kids come to play-along and fun things are all we ever do!\" i may love to play but i take my food VERY SERIOUSLY. it ain\'t easy making lean, mean lamb chops like these. these babies are so good, even the only person at the dinner table tonight who has never liked lamb has become a convert. amazing job @chef_valentino and team. well done indeed üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #finedining @ristorante_da_valentino #ristorantedavalentino #chef_valentino #italian #lambchops #lamb

It\'s one of our fav pasta places because the crab meat is served in chunks.
