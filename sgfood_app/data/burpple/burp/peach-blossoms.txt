It\'s good and I just have to eat this even though I was already full by now. The rice was so fragrant, it complemented the tastiness of preserved meats very well. The claypot retained the heat of the rice resulting in that oh-so-comforting steam whenever you lift a spoonful of the well-oiled rice.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting
[CNY Menu] Definitely a luxurious item to serve your guests during Chinese New Year.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The lobster was fresh, bouncy, and only a bit of rubbery though generally tender. Some may like that that the salted egg with cheese sauce was rich and flavourful, while some may feel that with lobster this fresh, the cream could be less heavy so that the natural sweetness of the lobster could shine. I like that it was really tasty, and so convenient with the Boston lobster claw all deshelled.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
Delightful smoky and fragrant, this is an example of a simple dish executed so perfectly.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I actually asked the chef how he achieved he pleasant smokiness both on the skin and infused within the flesh. He explained he used lychee wood and some special ingredients, and I am unable to reveal more. I really love that it\'s juicy and tender, with smoky touches crafted by Chef Francis Chong.&#x2028;🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting
Among the many sets available at Peach Blossoms, this suits smaller groups because there is only a minimum of 2 pax for this 6 course menu.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Fragrant black garlic with umami coming from the seasoned grains giving it a more complex texture though still dominated by the smooth and fatty cod. Love this too, suitable for light eaters.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
This is known to be the most expensive mushrooms besides top grade truffles, partly because it cannot be farmed and are all hand picked naturally.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The mushroom lends a light earthy tone to the soup, and is wonderfully aromatic. I like that the soup was full of flavour from long hours of double boiling the soup. So good, I finished every drop of it.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
Whole Suckling Pig served peking duck style. This is part of the 7 course Glorious Set, a Private Room menu held in one of Peach Blossoms private rooms, requiring 3 days advance reservation.\n<br />🔸\n<br />More detailed review of this CNY menu would follow shortly.
[CNY Menu] This is so good. The suckling pig is crispy and crumbly, and it\'s served over softly made crepes with scallion and sweet sauce just like peking duck... but better. The skin of suckling pig is much thicker than that of a peking duck, so the suckling pig is still distinctive even after being rolled into the crepe.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The Glorious Set also includes Salmon Yu Sheng with Mixed Fruits, Whole Suckling Pig, Buddha Jumps over the Wall, Steamed Grouper with Black Garlic.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I really missed this. Now I would like to suggest to more Chinese restaurants to serve this atas version of peking duck!\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
This, you can \"loh\" to your hearts content - it\'s pretty, colourful and the bowl is so huge that it should contain most of the shredded aftermath 😂. In terms of taste, this is a special Yusheng containing rock melon, mango, jackfruit, kiwi, pomelo and strawberries. So much crunchy fruity sweetness that you can cut down on the plum sauce and rely more on the play by the multiple fruits.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
So pretty, my eyes were bouncing between these three admiring the intricacies and wondering which to start with.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Appetizers plated like this usually require you to start from left to right, but this is my ordering: I started with the chilled Japanese cucumber roll (right) which was filled with jelly fish, moved to the prawn coated with mayo and mixed nuts (left), then finally the deep fried scallop and banana wrapped with mashed taro (centre). Good medley of the three - one\'s refreshing, one\'s creamy, and one\'s crispy.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is an invited media tasting.
This is part of Peach Blossoms new abalone menu.\n<br />🔸\n<br />You know a good abalone when you have one. I like that the abalone is thick, firm, yet soft to the bite, so that it can be sliced easily with the knife or teeth without feeling rubbery. It\'s also seafood briny and sweet, with superior sauce well absorbed into the center. This is worthy of being the highlight of Peach Blossoms\' new menu.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a media tasting.
Missing this abalone, 红烧六头鲍鱼, I had at Peach Blossoms last month at a media tasting. Thick, firm, yet soft to the bite. Briny and sweet, with the sauce well absorbed into the center.
#ChefFrancisChong has done it again at #PeachBlossoms , the menu is healthy yet tasty. Sweet succulent fresh steamed prawns w black garlic dish is light and I ate with relish :)
The special soy sauce is so yummy, I can down the white rice without anything else. Comfort food at its best.
Impressive size. Marina Mandarin\'s mooncake is 6.5 inches, probably good to share with one extended family!
Delightful appetizer, sunny tomatoes packed with flavours in sweet plum vinegar
Preserved raddish (daikon) Japanese style rolled in crabmeat and seaweed and beancurd skin. Lightly fried.
This is certainly my favourite asian interpretation of the fried calamari. Coated in a thin flour batter, the chef cleverly adapt the star ingredient/ recipe of Singapore cereal prawn (an iconic dish now) by adding the crispy chilli flavoured cereal crumbs to the fried squid tentacles (which have more bite and character than its body). Love it!

Food has improved by leaps since the subpar experience last CNY. The promotional menu runs through 30 Apr.
香酥魷魚、花雕醉雞、魚翅蟹肉炒蛋鬆. Spiced crispy calamari, rice wine infused chilled chicken, stir fried sharks fin crab meat with egg truffle
Hot pumpkin cream with hasma and coconut milk served in an adorable mini pumpkin! 
Chilled organic avocado purée with chocolate ice cream. Oh so luscious and creamy!
Quail egg wrapped in soy braised pork belly which in turn is wrapped in zucchini. Excellent with the soy vinegrette with julienned garlic.
This is an absolute delicacy that goes perfect with steamed rice. The Soon Hock fish fillet is fried but it\'s tenderness preserved. Claypot stewed with Roast Pork Belly(燒肉), Salted Fish (鹹魚)and Egg Plant(茄子), their awesome flavours are infused in the fish. Need I say more.
Steamed Crabmeat with Egg White
It was blissfully delicious, the rice vermicelli hinting at \"wok hei\" (wok\'s fiery breath during preparation) and was basked in broth sweetened by fresh seafood. Not a single sliver of the smooth rice vermicelli was left in the bowl!\n<br />🔹️\n<br />#food #foodie #foodblog #fooddiary #foodjournal #fotd #foodstagram #foodpic #foodreview #foodlover #foodporn #foodgasm #foodgram #instafood #igfood #foodspotting #whati8today #thearcticstar #hungrygowhere #burpple #peachblossoms #marinamandarinsg #vermicelli #seafood
🔹️\n<br />That, ringed by crushed Oreo crumbs and colorful flower petals. Hope your Friday is stellar, my dears.
It is not difficult to understand why the beef cheek is so nice to the bite. It\'s definitely a new favourite from now on!
Chef Francis from Peach Blossoms @marinamandarinsg has secured some great quality wagyu beef for this month\'s promo. \n<br />Aside from the usual cuts, you MUST look out for this awesomely unforgettable oxtail which left everyone asking for a second serving.  This makes wagyu steak so mainstream. 🤣 \n<br />At $28, this portion is better shared with another because you will want to get a bowl of rice and drench it with the richly fragrant red wine sauce as well.  While at it, enjoy divine moments by slowly savouring the soft-until-can-die beef.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#peachblossoms\n<br />#marinamandarin #burpple #burpplesg #Chinese #Cantonese #cuisine #wagyu #beef #oxtail #ForgottenCuts #SGParentBloggers #sgfoodie #sgblogger #instafood_sg #onthetable #hungrygowhere #foodstagram #foodcoma #foodpics #foodgasm #food #fathersday #whati8today
The yam was soft and remained moist while the flaky skin did it\'s job imparting a different texture to the mash.
At first look, just meesua, soup, spring onion, scallops and some seafood.
This is done by Terry, one of Peach Blossoms\'s talented Managers who spent many of his prime years in the F&amp;B industry in China.  Just put in your request when you make your table reservation! \n<br />The #jiandui #煎堆 by Chef Francis was yummilicious with a lotus paste wrapped in the sticky chewy glutinous rice ball.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#peachblossoms\n<br />#marinamandarin #burpple #Chinese #Cantonese #cuisine #dessert #SGParentBloggers #sgfoodie #sgblogger #instafood_sg #onthetable #hungrygowhere #foodpics #foodgasm #food #birthday #fathersday
So nutritious, so multidimensionally flavourful, we emptied soup bowl without leaving behind a single drop of the black liquid.  Don\'t miss out any portion of the soup ingredients when you\'re there!  Each and every piece are 好料 ok!
As the name \"Yuan Yang\" suggests, a serving comes with a portion each of crispy deep-fried and wok-fried combination of kuay teow to make up the heavenly plate of hor fun.
We thought this Stir-fried “Hong Kong” Kai Lan with King Oyster Mushrooms,\n<br />Dried Shrimp and Chili Padi (子椒虾米鸡腿菇炒香港芥兰)  was simply another veg dish.  In the end, everybody raved about the dish.
The tenderness of this Braised Lamb Ribs with Bean Curd Stick\n<br />in “Traditional” Style\n<br />(古法支竹羊排煲) was unbelievable. The meat literally dropped off the bone with just a slight tear.
The familiar \"chaotah\" bee hoon was given a touch of elegance with the abundance of shredded duck meat stir-fried to smokey fragrance.  Even though very full, we loved this to bits!
We have introduced 2 other dishes earlier.
Every piece was exquisitely handmade and distinctively special with it\'s own flavour. \n<br />A cut above traditional dimsum mass-production restaurants where minced meat with the occasional prawn bits disguised with a different look for every other item, this is worth all the calories.  所谓点到心头上的快乐 ，就是这样由来 ♡\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#peachblossoms #marinamandarin #bostonlobster #promotion #burpple ##foodiegram #hungrygowhere #foodstagram #foodcoma #instafood_sg
Generously laced with oatmeal and the distinct taste of fried egg white, this will be the highlight at Peach Blossoms @marinamandarinsg in the coming month.
We wish we could curl up with some comfort food right about now. But we\'re preparing ourselves for the CNY feasts that\'s about to come our way. Check out this awesome soup shot by @eyecandyfactorysg at Peach Blossoms, Marina Mandarin. Read the full review up on www.foodievstheworld.com now.
At about 100g each, they hold a delicate taste while retaining it\'s distinct succulent flavour from the sea.  I love the mollusk\'s firm texture and really enjoyed savouring the luxurious delicacy generously drizzled with the superior oyster sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />I wish I can eat this everyday ♡\n<br />.\n<br />The Abalone Set Menu is now available at $128++ per pax.  For reservations, pls call 68451118 or visit www.marinamandarin.com.sg/dining for more details.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks to @marinamandarinsg and @globegalsg for the meal invite.\n<br />.\n<br />#peachblossoms  #marinamandarin #abalone #burpple
.\n<br />I love that the thick assam sauce is a refreshing perk-me-up with just the right degree of tangy flavour to complement the sweet codfish meat.\n<br />.\n<br />Not only is the fish fresh, it also retained its succulence.  Cod is also one of my favourite fish to cook at home.  However, I can never achieve this kind of succulence no matter how i steamed, grilled or airfried it.\n<br />.\n<br />A highly recommended dish in the 7-course Abalone Set Menu.  Available from now til 14th Nov at $128++ per pax.\n<br />.\n<br />#peachblossoms #marinamandarin #burpple #codfish #assam #chinesefood
💕💕\n<br />.\n<br />Loved the delightful crispy texture on the outside that was combined with moist sweetness of scallop and banana. #whati8today as part of the Simply Indulge in Abalone 7-course set menu @$128++ per person at Peach Blossoms at the Marina Mandarin.\n<br />.
This is part 5 of the new 7-item Abalone Set Menu at Peach Blossoms, @marinamandarinsg. .\n<br />The pork ribs were cooked \"Dong Po\"-style.  They were first steamed until the meat are ready-to-drop-off kind of tender, then bathed with hot oil to achieve that caramelised taste with a little crisp on the skin.  The clever use of ribs instead of belly provided a healthier option for everyone. ❤\n<br />.\n<br />Coupled with asparagus that balanced the meaty serving, this was one of our favourite dish during yesterday\'s media lunch. .\n<br />The Abalone Set Menu is now available at $128++ per pax.
