I love this dessert, was surprised to find the matcha cake enclosing a molten matcha ganache!\n<br />🔸\n<br />What also went well was that it was served with azuki red beans, which was so perfect for matcha. What I felt was an after thought was probably the vanilla ice cream, could they have chosen a more Japanese flavour instead, such as black sesame? Some might have preferred the matcha interior to be more flowy, but it\'s a ganache after all so I\'m fine with it.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I would still recommend this. This tastes better than the pretty Cup Cloud, if you\'ll take only one dessert or if you like matcha, choose This!
Imagine this to be a plate of potato chips in the shape of spinach leaves. I lost count on the number of leaves I had grabbed. They are so crisp and thin, there’s a satisfying crunch in every bite! It’s not overly seasoned or salty, but yet flavourful in every crunch!\n<br />🌱\n<br />Check out my blog for the review\n<br />🍃\n<br />Short rant : People need to stop stealing my noob-ass photos. Especially the ones that are horribly shot, over exposed, over saturated. Or I\'m gonna have to start watermarking all my pictures will the LARGEST RAINBOW DASH YEOFOTO WATERMARK YOU WILL EVER SEE! Or just screw it and just continue shooting cars. At least people in the car scene are willing to credit me unlike the food and retail industry, ripping off my pictures and using them to make money! 🤔\n<br />Ok Melissa is not PMS-ing but it looks like G has taken down the advertisement! ☺️
Four desserts hhere at a very good price! There\'s a yoghurt and lime mousse with fruits, there\'s yam brulee, chocolate and banana crumbles, and Mango sticky rice here.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Of special mention, the yam brulee has a caramelized sugar layer encasing yam which tastes like a dense orh nee! I love it. The chocolate and banana crumbles was served as a glittering ball with warm molten banana chocolate served on the side (more pour shot!).\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
New item on the menu. This US duck breast is slow baked till tender, and as with most other dishes here, this is given a Asian twist by topping it with rendang and pineapple chutney. The pineapple chutney with hint if mandarin definitely made it feel like a CNY dish.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.

It carries a sweet fragrance along with the juices from the fats and meats, this is another highly recommended dish to try at Beast &amp; Butterflies.\n<br />😍\n<br />I am so coming back for more! Chef @brycelimg13 sure knows how to choose his meats, marinate them and send them to happy tummies of customers!\n<br />💅🏽 model : @msginginly \n<br />Review up on blog!

This is VERY GOOD. Mangalica pork is known to be the Kobe of pork, and this Mangalica pork collar is served in bulogogi sauce along with scallion brown rice galette and kimchi cucumber.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The pork is very tender with a strong but very pleasant taste of pork. Like wagyu, this slab of mangalica is well marbled, hence very juicy. Chef Bryce @brycelimg13 also managed to handle the grill well, so the exterior has a nice smoky light crispy and fragrance. #mangalica #pork
❣️\n<br />Premium ingredients such as Abalone, Dried Scallops, Fish Maw were shimmered for a few hours together with Prawns, Dried Oysters, Roast Pork Belly, Fa Choy, Broccoli, Chinese Mushrooms and Pak choy to make up this pot! The broth was so good with all the essence from the \"👍🏼 ho liao\"! ❣️\n<br />I love the pak choy most cos it soaked up all the essence, so flavorful!\n<br />❣️\n<br />This portion for 02 pax but could be shared among more if other dishes were ordered. You may also choose the Treasure Pot plus Salmon Yu Sheng set at $138++ for dine in, $168++ for takeaway.\n<br />❣️\n<br />-\n<br />❣️Beast and Butterflies Restaurant\n<br />90 Robertson Quay\n<br />M Social Hotel\n<br />Singapore 238259\n<br />Tel: 66570018\n<br />Sun to Thurs 7am - 10.30pm\n<br />Fri/Sat 7am - 12mn\n<br />❣️\n<br />Thank you @beastandbutterflies for hosting last night\'s dinner and @justinfoodprints for extending the invitation.
So shiok to have a bowl of Teochew Style Crab Meat Broth Lobster Porridge with Abalone @beastandbutterflies now.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks to Andy Wong @millenniumhotelsasia for having and awesome spread by Executive Chef @brycelimg13\n<br />.\n<br />Location: @beastandbutterflies @msocialsingapore, 90 Robertson Quay, level 1, Singapore  238259\n<br />.\n<br />#millenniumhotelsasia #msocialsingapore #beastandbutterflies #burpple #burpplesg
🥘\n<br />This auspicious dish is filled to the brim with layers of luscious and exquisite ingredients and delicacies such as seafood and meat.\n<br />🥘\n<br />This pen cai would suit most palates as it has a umami flavour  that will awake your senses the moment it touches you palate. It is not too salty either, it carries the mushroom goodness from the juices to the other ingredients.\n<br />🥘\n<br />Thank you @justinfoodprints and @beastandbutterflies  for the invite!
This pork knuckle crackles! So loving this winning siew yoke, or you can say it\'s a German pork knuckle that was given an Asian treatment. It\'s served with Asian sauerkraut (which is like chap chye with lots of zest) and Nam Jin sauce (a Thai dipping sauce).\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
[New Menu Preview] Strawberry basil, this came with fresh strawberries, basil ice cream, butter cake and balsamic pearls. Pictured is my wife pouring vanilla cream with fresh basil over the dessert.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I really like how executive chef has infused local and Asian elements into his food, and creates dishes that are better than many restaurants. Very talented. Thought has also been put into their desserts to create those with interesting but well balanced flavours.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is just a preview of my tasting at Beast and Butterflies last evening. I\'ll recommend my favourite dishes in coming posts over the next week.
This porridge is so comforting. Plump rice grains cooked as a teochew style porridge, soaking up that warm and clear lobster broth. I enjoy drinking the broth, which is filled with the natural sweetness of lobster, yet it\'s light and won\'t make you feel too gelat eating this.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Those who like their porridge to be filled with the creaminess of lobster roe would be disappointed, but those with a lighter palate who can appreciate simple sweetness from seafood would love this.\n<br />🔸\n<br />There\'s also an abalone hidden inside!
This salmon fillet is sous vide, hence it\'s evenly cooked from the exterior to its interior, and it was soooo tender, so smooth. The exterior is then pan fried for that char and crisp on its surface which I like, before serving it in soy emulsion, with aubergine confit and sautéed snow peas.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I like how this tasted. You can also probably tell from its presentation, that $25 for this piece of salmon is a really good price.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
This is very good and very value for money. I can imagine two person to come here for this, order two rice, and slurp on this pot of goodness and only spend about $40 per person.\n<br />🔸\n<br />There are 4 abalone here, with roast pork, fish maw, scallops, prawns, mushrooms, dried oysters. And don\'t underestimate the cabbages, I finished every piece of cabbage in this because it has soaked up the thick and flavorful gravy, which ain\'t too salty. This is like a good pot of comfort food that grandma would approve.
Thank you guys for your support thus far. Let\'s welcome 2017 with smile and positivity! 🙂🍾🎉🎊

It\'s looking cool, and that\'s because this photo is taken at the chic, trendy yet cosy venue at M Social Hotel.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Pictured is the sweet and sophisticated ending to our feast with the beast, with macarons, strawberries and a wide selection of aged cheeses which was infused with truffles, forest fruit, peach alcohol or bourgogne red wine.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The \"Feast with the Beast\", only available till end of this month, also includes a seafood tower, a huge slab of meat platter, caesar salad, hokkaido pumpkin soup. It isn\'t a buffet but there\'ll be way too much food even for beast eaters. Thank you @msocialsingapore for the invited tasting!
Oyster Shooters ($10 for a pair). Fresh plump oysters dressed in a Asian dressing of basil, fish sauce, lime and fried shallots. They\'ve the usual fresh oysters served with lemons too, but I thought this is gave an interesting Thai twist to our standard fresh oysters. Plus, it\'s served in a pretty crystal shot glass as pictured :)
Probably in need of a detox now after consecutive days of feasting, and we found this caesar salad to be really good. Just the right amount of cream with fresh juicy vegetables.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The \"Feast with the Beast\", only available till end of this month, also includes a seafood tower, a huge slab of meat platter, caesar salad, hokkaido pumpkin soup, strawberries, macarons, cheeses and red wine.

We were all surprised by the sheer size of the seafood presented here, which includes Alaskan king crab, salmon sashimi, fresh oysters, prawns and live clams.\n<br />🔸\n<br />For a better deal, opt for the \"Feast with the Beast\" at $88++ per pax which also includes this seafood tower, plus a huge slab of meat platter, Caesar salad, Hokkaido pumpkin soup, a platter of aged cheese, a macaron pyramid and strawberries. It isn\'t a buffet but there\'ll be way too much food even for large eaters.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This seafood tower will be here to stay, but the \"Feast with the Beast\" will only be available till end of this month.

extravaganza dessert consisting of chocolate and banana crumble, mango sticky rice, yoghurt and lime mousse and yam brulee. i particularly liked the crumble and brulee. 
This place is so gorgeous, so much potential, so chio, yet not widely reviewed. \n<br />I be honest. The only reason why I dined here is because I walked past and the server (thin Chinese guy in specs) was so polite and told me to walk in have a look.
Always on the lookout for new dinner spots to impress your date? This flamboyant space on the first floor of M Social Singapore (not to be confused with Studio M Hotel) is the place to bring your beau. The massive pad is decked with lava lamps, chandeliers projecting artworks and even a sprawling wall of 40 iPads displaying visual art pieces specially designed by French icon Philippe Starck — all great as conversation starters. Together with their bold East-meets-West dishes, expect a novel dining experience here. Start with the Simply Scallop ($24) — Hokkaido scallops served carpaccio-style, drizzled with a tangy yuzu and ginger marinade. Then, try the Great Rack of Lamb ($36), where unbelievably tender mutton meat is marinated with oriental spices and served with steamed glutinous rice and Sichuan peppercorn, while the Lobster Porridge ($28), Executive Chef Bryce Li\'s specialty, is a comforting bowl of Teochew porridge teeming with abalone slices and topped with a lobster. Finish the meal on a high with the Yam Brulee ($10) — a twist on the traditional Teochew dessert topped with coconut ice cream. \n<br />Avg price: $50 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Sam Chua
Light &amp; Dark. East &amp; West. Hot &amp; Cold. Beast &amp; Butterflies.
The house signature dessert, a rich yam / taro pudding, like the Teochew Orh Nee, served chilled, with a beautiful caramelised sugar crust, and a creamy scoop of coconut ice cream. \n<br />So good!
Crispy skin and moist tender meat on this German pork knuckle, served with a sour spicy Thai nam jim sauce!
Clear seafood bouillabaisse, fusion broth of jasmine, osmanthus, and crab stock. Fragrant and savoury sweet, with fresh squid, crab pincer, clams, and shrimp! Add crispy rice for a nice crunch!
Modern fusion at play with these duck rilette wantons. Satisfiyingly crisp skin, tender moist savoury duck!
3 Gin, Cherry-infused Brandy, Bitters, Sugar) from the buzzy Beast &amp; Butterflies, situated within the slinky and sexy M Social hotel at Robertson Quay. Pretty impressive presentation efforts, and while the drinks may evoke memories of \"let\'s get hammered for cheap\" back in the day, you sure reach your destination fast.
The mildly spicy laksa itself with its abundance of floaty shrimpy bits was virtually inconsequential as its ingredients clamour for your favour like fame-starved influencer whores - the deep fried and intensely crispy tau pok pieces were revelatory, while elsewhere the cherrystone clams possessed a briny oceanic swagger and the hippo-fat, de-shelled prawns had more bounce than a Ramadan Bazaar bouncy castle. 4/5
Perfect marriage of asian and western ingredients. Barramundi baked with spring onions, ginger, Hong Kong choy sum, shimeiji mushrooms, carrots and sauteed U.S. asparagus.  End result is a pot of flavourful dish, especially love the tender flaky flesh too.  We had this on its own though I think to have this with a bowl of fragrant steamed rice would be good too!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Beast &amp; Butterflies\n<br />M Social Singapore\n<br />90 Robertson Quay\n<br />(S) 238259\n<br />==========\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Hosted meal by @beastandbutterflies @brycelimg13, extended invite by @justinfoodprints - thank you! \n<br />#msocialsingapore #beastandbutterflies\n<br />#foodsg #sgfood #instasg #foodiesg #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #travel #instatravel #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats
Especially so for a good cracking pork, such as the pork knuckle ($25 half/$35 full) pictured, available at Beast &amp; Butterflies.  The ham hock is roasted to perfection, succulent and has a good bite to it from the crispy pork skin to the meat.  Dish is served with asian sauerkraut and two sauces (*addictive* thai savoury chilli and chinese sweet soy) for a flavourful dip.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Beast &amp; Butterflies\n<br />M Social Singapore\n<br />90 Robertson Quay\n<br />(S) 238259\n<br />==========\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Hosted dinner by @beastandbutterflies @brycelimg13, extended invite by @justinfoodprints - thank you! #msocialsingapore #beastandbutterflies\n<br />#foodsg #sgfood #instasg #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #travel #instatravel #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats
.\n<br />Beast &amp; Butterflies serves this unique rendition, creatively named Nian Gao Cigars (S$12, avail 12 Feb till 02 Mar) - sweet nian gao wrapped in spring roll skin fried to perfection to achieve a crispy texture on the outer layer yet maintains a soft, slightly sticky texture within. The dish comes with golden custard and salted egg yolk sauce, which makes a good dip to pair with the sticks though I would much prefer having these on their own.\n<br />.\n<br />==========\n<br />Beast &amp; Butterflies\n<br />90 Robertson Quay\n<br />M Social Singapore\n<br />Level 1\n<br />(S) 238259\n<br />==========\n<br />This is a hosted tasting by @beastandbutterflies @brycelimg13, and invited by @justinfoodprints #msocialsingapore #beastandbutterflies\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cny #chinesenewyear #dessert #foodsg #sgfood #instasg #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #travel #instatravel #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats

Did you know the Mangalica pig is a domestic pig that comes from Hungary and have thick woolly coats just like sheep.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />So very apt this dish is \"Wooly Pork\". Thick but yet alittle firm and tender. Sweet and tangy which gives you that scintillating edge. The scent of the bulgogi sauce is like \"a breath of fresh air\". Keeping it company is the scallion brown rice which was texturally a pleasure to nibble on.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />One of the better dishes. This was an invited tasting by @brycelimg13 @beastandbutterflies 🖑🖐@tiara_star Thank you for holding the heavy slab.
Now you can enjoy a pot of Pen Cai with a smaller group of friends, without breaking your wallet.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This Treasure Pot (Pen Cai), priced at $68++ for dine-in, is good to share among 4-5 pax.

Thank you @beastandbutterflies for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for the invite.
You look tough. A gentle cut and alittle redness was exposed. The meat was tender and a tinge of crispness on the outside. Nice aromatic seasonings. An enjoyable bite. So tough looking but a softie inside.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />This was a media invite. Thank you, Chef Bryce @beastandbutterflies for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for the invite.
Go visualize how soft and moist it can be once you sink your teeth into this lovely tenderness. \n<br />The steamed oriental glutinous rice and the fried lotus root serve as dainty bite size snacks that you can gleefully indulge in as a sideshow. \n<br />Glazed with the tangy peppercorn jus, this sichuan influenced dish has a numbing spicyness that could delight those with a penchant for sharp, piquant flavours

Topped with a splotch of zesty pineapple chutney and complemented by the acerbic fried spinach &amp; zucchini cake below, the flavours will be like melody to your palate with their beautiful harmonization.
🔸🔸\n<br />Egg noodles fried till crispy. Cod baked to perfection and had a very tender sweetness which was balanced off by the soy sauce. The sauce was not too starchy or thick and it added moisture to the dry noodles. On one plate, the sweet, salty, soft and crunchy textures all dancing in unison with each other. 🔸🔸\n<br />A fantastic dish. This gets my 4.5 out of 5 \"msginginly\" \'s drooling slurps.

Accompanied by 5 different Dips - Soy &amp; Wasabi, Pink Ginger &amp; Sesame Mayo, Cocktail, Cilantro &amp; Garlic Soy, Mint &amp; Lime Sour Mayo.
So today, finally I decided I have to have it. ◾◾\n<br />Porridge came in this heavy stone pot. Half a Boston lobster lying so comfortably on top. Flesh was fresh, super sweet and chunky. Accompanied by a whole abalone that had a wholesome flavor. The bestest was the very tasty lobster broth that took 6 hours to prepare. What you get is a smooth, rich and mellifluous soup. Rice grains were not boiled down till fine. To me, the texture of the grains which were a tad \"plump\" was imperative, to soak up the umaminess of the broth. I threw in chilli padis for heat and it gave the broth an added dimensional yummilicious level. A full bodied but yet light broth that was delish and addictive.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Good for rainy days, \"appetite-less\" and when one feels under the weather or when you just want soup. I would rate this 4.5 out of 5 \"msginginly\" \'s drooling slurps.\n<br />So happy I ate this. Thank you, Anne, @millenniumhotel my lovely handmodel and the wonderful company.

In actual fact, we had the desserts platter which had 4 different types. I felt this was the better one whilst the other 3 was not to my liking.\n<br />🔼\n<br />Tangy, slight sweetness and sourish. Haiz.... somehow I enjoyed looking at the chio restaurant more as compared to consuming my dessert. But then... perhaps I shall visit again to try the mains.
Signature dish for a reason. Missing this laksa mee tai mak already. #latergram #staycation #igsg #sgig #msocial #msocialsg ##sgig #beastandbutterflies #laksa #hungrygowhere #burpple #straitstimeslife #nofilter #onthetable #foodvsco #vscocam #robertsonquay
My top picks ­from this dessert plat­ter, Extravaganza, ­are:­ Yam Brulee­ - rich Orh Nee with a beautifully caramelized ­sugar crust, lightene­d up with a scoop of ­creamy coconut ice cream \n<br />The Chocoholic­ - a spectacle of molten chocolate, poured by the friendly staff(not pictured here) that melts the chocolate sphere which encases chocolate and­ banana cubes, infuse­d with Sichuan pepper­ sauce. I like how th­e spicy notes add an ­interesting dimension­ to the dessert. \n<br />#beastandbutterflies #msocial #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #whatiate #burpple #hungrygowhere #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #tgif #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger #sweettreat #sweettooth #dessertssg
There’s­ scrumptious food, de­lectable beverages, c­omfortable couches an­d even a pool table!
This was a beautiful Asian dessert with a Western twist of preparation.
However, note that steamed Atlantic Cod Fillet is used here, with crispy Hong Kong crispy egg noodles and served with bailing mushroom so often associated as \"mock abalone\" in vegetarian restaurants.  Flakey, snowy cod was of course, freshly sweet in taste, enhanced by the superior soy sauce it was immersed in.
Chocoholic (SGD$10.00) - a chocolate and banana sphere where we watched the servers dousing rich molten liquid chocolate over the dark chocolate ball, dramatically reducing it to a collapsed heap of chocolate and banana cubes infused with Szechuan pepper sauce.
Wagyu Beef served with Masala potato gratin, U.S. asparagus and natural beef jus. This was an exotic dish and we loved the tender, moistened Wagyu beef that knives slit through easily enough, as well as the spiced Indian-inspired masala potato gratin - strangely the flavor complemented the beef\'s sweeter tone rather than clash.
I am coming back for you soon....
Best for a rainy day. One of the best valued lobster dishes around.\n<br />Rating : 🌝🌝🌝🌜\n<br />.\n<br />Beast &amp; Butterflies\n<br />M Social Hotel 1st Level\n<br />90 Robertson Quay \n<br />Singapore 238259\n<br />Opening Hours :\n<br />Lunch 11.30am to 2.30pm\n<br />Dinner 05.00pm to 10.30pm\n<br />.\n<br />#sgwanderlust #sgmondays #sglunch #msocial #sghotels #foodblogger #sgeats #sgfood #burpple #foodpic #lobsterporridge #teochew #sgchinese #sgcafe #foodsg #food #igsg #sgig #singapore #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #wanderlust #travel #travelgram #instagood
⠀\n<br />It was supposed to be a glorious sphere collapse but alas...
Whilst the burnt, clumpy vermicelli had the requisite wok hei, the thick and peppery gravy was largely horfun-esque in world view. 3.4/5
This is their chicken burger. \n<br />The restaurant is located at the newly opened @msocialsingapore. \n<br />Currently in love the tiles at here which they imported from Spain and the ambience in it!
