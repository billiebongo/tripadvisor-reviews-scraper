truffle shoyu soba with char siew and ajitama egg, yuzu wantons, bamboo shoot, leeks, parsley, truffle puree
It was in a tiny shop somewhere in one of the lanes in Shinjuku. The evening was cold and the bowl of ramen was just so soothing and warm.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />It has been raining the past few days and weather had been a little cool. So very automatically I head for hot ramen at the michelin star restaurant. Ramen was cooked aldente and broth was not too bad. For the price I paid, I find the portion is small. Gone in 10 mins without a drop in sight.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />I still miss that quaint little shop in Shinjuku. One day soon, will visit again for that delish beyond words and miles big bowl of authentic steamy hot bowl of ramen that made me so warm and fuzzy.
A relatively new side dish.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Aburi niku... pork cubes torched and drenched in onion sauce. The cubes looked tough but it is surprisingly quite tender. Dip in the onion sauce which had a nice sweet salty finish that is key in adding extra flavors to the pork.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Just a little something something to tide away hunger pangs.
Sliced Roasted Pork Shoulder on Japanese Rice topped with fragrant butter sauce. Apart from its Michelin-stared Ramen, @tsutasingapore also offers a really great range and affordable selection of side dishes to add on to your mains! I had this in addition to my mini Ajitama Shoyu Soba ($7.50), which made the whole presenation of the dishes look like a half-and-half option.\n<br />.\n<br />#makandaydream \n<br />#18taiseng\n<br />#tsuta\n<br />#tsutasg\n<br />#japanese\n<br />#rosumeshi\n<br />#porkshoulder\n<br />#burpple\n<br />#burpplesg\n<br />#sgfood\n<br />#sgfoodies\n<br />#sgfoodporn\n<br />#sgeats\n<br />#hungrygowhere\n<br />#8dayseat\n<br />#stfoodtrending\n<br />#foodinsing
The ramen at Tsuta are really different from your regular ramen joint because it\'s Soba. I must add that I found the broth to be on the lighter side with a unique taste as well. Can\'t exactly pin point whether this is better or not but the highlight of the bowl is the char siew and egg! It\'s awesome. I\'ve never tasted something better. Charsiew was crunchy and chewy but its nowhere near hard. The egg was another display of great execution and skill. Got to try it at least once!
There was a short queue but I did not have to wait too long.\n<br />*\n<br />I had the Char Siu Ajitama Shoyu Soba. It is called soba instead of ramen because of the texture - smooth and springy like soba.\n<br />*\n<br />The broth was delicious with a strong but not overpowering truffle flavour.\n<br />*\n<br />The ajitama (ramen egg) was executed well with a soft and runny centre.\n<br />*\n<br />We also ordered the soup chazuke where you can add your leftover broth into a bowl of rice with bonito flakes and seaweed. Yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />I enjoyed my meal here but I don\'t think I would be standing in queue for it though.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_tsuta #tsutasingapore #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The thick miso soup base with porcini mushroom oil was slurp worthy but got a little tad heavy for me towards the end. Mix in the hot sauce for an additional kick. I\'m actually impressed by the thick slices of char siu served. So there you go, a one star Michelin ramen bowl.\n<br />#tsutaramen #tsutasg #miso #ramen #slurps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm
I\'ve had better in Tokyo.

I say order both &amp; share with your buddy! I recommend ordering the $23.8 Char Siu Ajitama Miso Soba though if you\'re alone &amp; only have room for one! It comes with 4 slices of Char Siu + a flavoured egg if you ! Unami @ its best!\n<br />~\n<br />Jus so you know, the Miso Soba from @tsutasingapore is available EXCLUSIVELY @ 18 Tai Seng; a NEW shopping mall located a stone\'s throw from Tai Seng MRT nia! Another fun fact, 2 other @michelinguide starred eateries are located within the same building too; do you guys know which are they?\n<br />üòâüòâüòâ\n<br />~\n<br />Pic taken @tsutasingapore @ 18 Tai Seng\n<br />18 Tai Seng Street\n<br /># 01-01\n<br />Singapore 5397755\n<br />Operating Hours: 11am - 9pm Daily\n<br />(Last Order 8:30pm)\n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Tsutasingapore\n<br />Website: http://www.tsuta.com\n<br />~
At the same time, they have launched a new Miso Soba ($16.00) that is exclusively available at the Tai Seng outlet.\n<br />.\n<br />For those who find that their Shio and Shoyu broth are too light, this Miso Soba broth is the heavier version.\n<br />.\n<br />Location: Tustasingapore 18 Tai Seng Street, #01-36/37/38/39, Mapletree 18, Singapore 539775\n<br />.\n<br />#tsutasingapore #tsutasg #michelinstar #sgramen #ramen #burpple #burpplesg

The unique thing about this particular outlet, as compared to the one at Pacific Plaza, is that here sells the exclusive Miso Soba which used hatcho red miso imported from Tokushima Prefecture.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Starting from $15 for a bowl, you get to savour the umami flavours here without having to travel to Japan. Additionally, porcini mushroom oil, bean sprouts, watercress and panfried corn were added giving it an earthy and thick rich broth which will appeal to most soba noodles lovers.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @tsutasingapore\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Japanese Soba Noodles Tsuta\n<br />Address: 18, Tai Seng Street, Unit 01-36/37/38/39, Singapore 539775\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #restaurantsg #tsutasingapore
Hatcho Miso imported from Tokushima Prefecture is utilize for their broth; Porcini Mushroom Oil, Bean Sprouts &amp; Watercress are oso added to further accentuate the miso flavour. The accompanying corn is pan-fried beforehand for crunch &amp; smokiness. You see that dollop of hot sauce there? Mixed it in for a broth with even more dimensions. Do oso note the noodles use are slightly thicker than the ones use for Shoyu to accompany the Miso\'s heavier broth!\n<br />~\n<br />Jus so you know, they are the first ramen store in Japan to earn a @michelinguide star. The store @ Tai Seng will only serve the Shoyu &amp; the Miso. Prices for the former range from $15 - $22.8; the latter is jus a dollar more for the basic one that comes with one slice of Char Siu sans egg @ $16 &amp; $23.8 for the Char Siu Ajitama Miso Soba which comes with 4 slices of Char Siu + a flavoured egg!\n<br />~\n<br />Pic taken @tsutasingapore @ 18 Tai Seng\n<br />18 Tai Seng Street\n<br /># 01-01\n<br />Singapore 5397755\n<br />Operating Hours: 11am - 9pm Daily\n<br />(Last Order 8:30pm)\n<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Tsutasingapore\n<br />Website: http://www.tsuta.com\n<br />~
This time, they have introduced a new flavour which is currently only available at the new Tai Seng outlet. The richer miso broth topped with porcini mushroom oil will be perfect for those who prefer heavier flavour toward tonkatsu-like broth. I love the thicker soba noodles specially made for this Miso Soba to absorb the miso flavours.\n<br />.\n<br />#tsutasingapore #tsutasg #ramen #miso #brandcellar #soba
This means there are two Michelin star stores at the same building.
