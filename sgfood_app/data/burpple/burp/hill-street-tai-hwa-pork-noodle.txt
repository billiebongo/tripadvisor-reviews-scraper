It\'s a must to buy whenever I passby! Blueberry Ricotta Cheesecake &amp; Yuzu Tart! 😋😋😋😋
We didn\'t plan to go here for lunch as we wanted to dine at a cafe further down the same row. However the other cafe rejected our Entertainer App coupon (such disappointment as there wasn\'t supposed to be any other terms and conditions but oh well😢) so we ended up here instead!! 
In need of a delicate dessert like this right now.\n<br />Light vanilla sponge and lychee mousse on an almond crumble base, topped with lychee, strawberry and a soft rose petal. Fruity, refreshing and definitely a gem for the eyes with a heart-shaped presentation.\n<br />#TwoBakersSG\n<br />#Cake #CafeHopping
I attribute my Ruby skills to coffee. ♨️\n<br />#ThreeThirtyItis #TwoBakersSG\n<br />#Coffee #CafeHopping
And coffee… even though I have one right next to me. 😕\n<br />#TwoBakersSG #CafeHopping #Coffee #Cake
Can\'t resist a carrot cake when I see it. This was sufficiently moist and fragrant (from spices), layered with smooth cream cheese buttercream, which I\'d prefer to have a stronger citrusy note to prevent monotony. Will be back for more tempting cakes behind the glass display.
Spice lovers will like this feisty number. The potent sambal chilli was evenly folded into the creamy risotto, and one can feel the burn with every bite, but it\'s so fragrant &amp; addictive that I just couldn\'t put down my spoon.
Plenty of French handmade pastries to choose from.. all look so pretty.. ordered 5 different pastries to try.. the lemon yuzu is really special.. highly recommended.. downside is the price of the pastries are slightly on the high side..
Portobello Eggs ($14.80): Beautifully poached Eggs on our fav mushyroom 😍 would love it even more if we could hav a slice of sourdough to soak up the runny yolk + hollandaise sauce. \n<br />2. Luncheon Fries ($9.80): the type I like!! Crispy &amp; still able to taste the soft luncheon. Served with sour cream that had a tinge of lime? - a refreshing twist! \n<br />#Burpple #burpplesg #noMondayBlues #toomanycafestoolittlebellyspace #happybellyMe
I still think this place serves the most value-for-money risotto! With a very chill and laid back ambience, this place definitely has its own charm to attract people from far away. Even my dining partner always wants to go back there again for their mushroom risotto (partly because of the entertainer app too 😅).
How I wish I can enjoy my Mt Fuji at Mt Fuji itself! Lightly fluffed white chocolate whipped cream that\'s resemble the snowy cover of Mt Fuji. Beneath it, lies layer of green tea ganache and sweet azuki beans. Light bittersweet tart that is suitable for after dinner. 
Beautifully sous de vide eggs sitting atop of smoked fresh salmon and warm toasty bagels. The eggs were so beautifully runny that eating it on a bagel was really too messy. All the eggs just wanted to escape into the bagel hole! Couldn\'t taste the cheese in the bagel or hollandaise sauce (which was stated in their menu) tho. Also it\'s a relatively smaller portion as compared to regular cafes! 
Lime tarts may be simple, but they are forever still one of my favourite flavours! This one ticked all the right boxes, being zesty and not overly sweet, having a good biscuit base that didn\'t crumble too easily and held the curd well without being soggy either! Better than your average lime tart - but the best part was how well they made the meringue/cream - so smooth and so silky!
This little number just caught my eyes when I eyeballed it 😍
[New Blog Post] \n<br />Enjoyed ourselves at Two Bakers with their French Toasts and Pancakes as well as delicious pastries. \n<br />Find out more\n<br />https://peanutloti.wordpress.com/2016/05/09/two-bakers-artisan-patisserie/

Ended the awesomeness with this gorgeous berries custard tart for the birthday boy. From my favorite tart place @twobakerssg! Boy said he could have finished the 20cm tart on his own. Yes it\'s that awesome. Now back to the daily grind. 4 more winks to GREECE!!
One thing\'s for sure - the taste of \"Yuzu Summer\" does its moniker justice. Laid on top of a slightly crunchy and crumbly sable base that\'s studded all around with pistachio, were a thin piece of matcha tea sponge and a dome of very light yuzu lemon yogurt. If you long for sharp zestiness, this dessert isn\'t the most suitable as it\'s more the delicate and balanced kind.
The soba was made appealingly salty and fragrant by the sauce and seasoning with the truffle being as light as a mynah\'s roadside abandoned feather with its touch, never being too heavy-handed with its usually militant agenda. Elsewhere, the succulent portobello mushroom squirted its juices at an indecent velocity and the egg offered the obligatory flowy titillation. 4/5
Essentially a living and breathing Kraft cheese slice creature in an amorous bear embrace with dairy-tempering blueberry. 3.7/5
One of the new creations here at Two Bakers, this would definitely hit up the alley of those who loves cheese. Unlike a conventional cheesecake, the mousse part seems a little bit more on the denser side here, without the usual zingy lemon flavour hence being slightly cheesier. Beneath contains a blueberry compote which gives it a berry sweetness which compliments well with the cheese mousse, while the almond crumble base replicates the usual graham-cracker base found it cheesecakes and crumbles nearly without falling into bits.
Unexpectedly wound up here for lunch and spotted this on their menu which seems to be new. This is something for those who love truffle, but doesn\'t like the entire dish to be overwhelmed with its pungent flavour. Served cold, the soba comes with a whiff of truffle while swimming in a small pool of Shoyu, with furikake sprinkled on the top coming with a sous-vide egg and grilled portobello. Seemingly refreshing, the Shoyu gives the soba a light savoury flavour while complimenting that short hint of truffle which lightly perfumes the soba so each of the elements of the dish is able to stand out with their own flavours. The grilled portobello adds a good, bouncy texture and earthy flavours, while if you are one who can\'t do without eggs for a meal, mix in the egg with the soba for a silkier texture. Definitely a good option for a light meal especially if you are one who don\'t see salads as a meal option and prefers something less \"green\" instead.
Wanted to try their Hazelnut rendition of the Cold Brew but it was sadly unavailable. The Cold Brew sadly isn\'t really their forte here though; while it did tasted milky, the drink felt a little weak and maybe diluted in flavour as compared to other cold brews somehow.
Loved the Key Lime Tart but didn\'t have the same feelings for this. Nonetheless, will surely be back to try the other tarts and cakes! 
Salted caramel sauce that come with a vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate crumbs. In a hot hot weather that can easily cool dw. JJIANG! 
One word, LOVE. This Key Lime Tart was crazy good and checks all the boxes! Crust was baked just right with a good thickness and the filling was so tangy that it tickles the palate. If you\'re like me and love sour flavored tarts, please give this a try. My eyes literally lit up when I had my first bite, no kidding! I adored the atmosphere in the cafe as well, no prizes to guessing if I\'ll be back!
As it was R\'s last day, she so kindly bought desserts for everyone! \n<br />Thanks R for the really pretty and delicious desserts 😋😋Wishing you all the best in your next job!
Just the right amount of chocolate and sweetness. Hazelnut provided texture and helped in reducing the sweetness. 
Still my favourite place to go for key lime tart. Ever since I have created a list of places that I have went for key lime/lemon desserts, Two Bakers has always been a hot contender for the top spot and has been one of my most recommended places to go to. The consistency in their tart crust and the tanginess of the key lime curd is just a marvelous combination for an after-meal treat.
Craving for the \"W\" cake with hazelnut dacquoise, rose cream, berries and a slab of watermelon in the middle. The watermelon core was quite surprising (for someone who obviously doesn\'t bother to read descriptions) and overall this cake is super refreshing and aromatic with the rose cream. The Key Lime Tart is perfect for those who like sour notes. &gt;.
Absolutely loved this Key Lime Pie ($6.80) from @twobakerssg, but not the overly milky coconut latte ($6.50).\n<br />.\n<br />Quote \"explodingbelly\" to get 15% off your @danielwellington purchases from danielwellington.com, valid till 29th feb! That\'s probably the only time you get something good when you quote my name. So.. SEIZE THE CHANCE.
Vongole Aglio Olio (S$14.80), which contains succulent white clams tossed in olive oil, white wine and spices.
Fragrant grains of rice with flavourful stock and generous amount of mushrooms were really pleasant. The absence of pumpkins (told by my friend who tried it 2x) was quite pitiful as I thought it was an interesting combination. Nevertheless, a delightful meal despite the burning afternoon heat. And the possibility of ending it with some refreshing citrusy tarts does excite me.
Got a Woody Logcake for my family. Those nanoblocks just wanna get a photo shoot with the beautiful cake! And most important of all, my family loves the logcake! 😄😋
The truffled paste did not shine through at all. In fact, I found it to be very forgettable, and redundant. The omelette is nicely fried soft and slightly flaky, but not memorable. Great portion, but definitely not wowed. 
Pretty matcha for a cold day, makes my day! Two Bakers is such a loving place to have tea and cakes.

Two perfectly poached eggs with thick slabs of smoked salmon on crusty bread. Delicious way to start the day. Hollandaise sauce was slightly too buttery for my liking but was still palatable. For under 15 dollars, it\'s definitely something worth coming back for.
Perfectly poached eggs, generous slices of smoked salmon served on crusty bread. What\'s not to love?! Hollandaise sauce was slightly split and was overly buttery. But other than that, it was absolutely delicious. Huge portions for the affordable price of under 15 dollars. Will be going back to try their pretty cakes! :) 
.\n<br />A harmonious blend of butternut pumpkin and mushroom to give this risotto a creamy and nutty flavour. Plus point to have this comfort food on a rainy Monday.\n<br />.\n<br />Two Bakers is also one of the participating cafes on Entertainer app, so enjoy the 1-for-1 before it expires this year! #省省省
Thai chicken burger (SGD13.80). Charcoal burger, with a chicken patty drizzled in Thai sauce, served with thick-cut fries. Sauce is on the spicier side, not so much to my liking.
\"Splatter\" molten lava cake well prepared, supporting roles were well played too. 
Happy Halloween!\n<br />.\n<br />吸血チュウ～～ /|\\( ;,; )/|\\.
Named \"Mount Fuji\", I\'m already sold by the looks of it! A cute dome full of matcha, Azuki beans and white chocolate ganache held together by the chocolate sablee tart base. Fell in love with the tart base instantly as it was dense and buttery. The Azuki beans were a pleasant surprise as it enriches the dessert yet holding back on the sweetness with the natural red bean bitterness. A well balanced dessert that deserves going back for more! 
A table full of Loacker themed desserts - a feast made for both the tummy and the eyes! 
In conjunction with its 90th birthday, Loacker has launched a new flavor for their classic crisp wafer - Raspberry Yoghurt. Tones of sweetness and acidity from the raspberry yoghurt cream intertwined within the layers of wafer gives a mouthful of crunch with a tangy finish. You won\'t just stop at one! Now I need to get my house well stocked with these bite sized treats. 
• Greedy Val Cake by Two Bakers • Next picture will show the interior 👻 •
A hazy and rainy Sunday afternoon makes me feel really sleepy. More than something savory, I have craving for good coffee and dessert to perk me up. Found ourselves here armed with papers and magazine, and parking coupons. Sipped on my Flat White and his Mocha. A nice, cool cafe with ambience so relaxing that I forgot to snap a shot of The Big Eater that we ordered to share, as we indulged in the  goodness of the tender sausage, tasty bacon, crispy harshbrown, warm toasts with butter, garden salad, mushrooms and cheery sunnyside-ups. Left the cafe with Le Chocolat Noir lingering on our tongues...
The soursop cheesecake ball must have done extensive meditation and ate a lot of almond/sesame dual paste at Hong Kong dessert cafes as it manages to achieve a harmonious yin-yang zenith - the exotic, cooling, tropical sourness of the sop artfully counterbalances the richness of the cheesecake half. 3.9/5
Butternut, the pumpkin-ish look alike from this dish, didn\'t stand out much from the dish. The cube sized mushrooms on the other hand was a delight, will their earthy (new word learnt) taste, giving a nice bite and bouciness. Overall, the risotto was creamy and slightly heavy on the cheese taste, but I\'m a person who enjoys a heavier taste. \n<br />On the side note, the baguette was crisp with a cream corn (?) taste to me. Pretty
Sablee Tart Base, Matcha Sponge, Yuzu Lemon Yogurt Mousse. The mousse carried a hint of light tartness with a flavour that seemed to be similar to that of a lemon-spiked cheesecake, while the matcha sponge tasted rather subtle and was of a little fluff for a bit of lighter flavour and texture. The Sablee Tart base was soft, but was not too messy when cut and gave cookie-like flavours while the white chocolate ring on the exterior gave the dessert some sweetness. It\'s an aesthetically appealing dessert that would definitely satisfy any person who loves pretty patisserie even all the way down to how it tasted, but this dessert seemed to lack personality and character as opposed to the Mt Fuji and Ondeh Ondeh Eclair that they have.
But I have to thank my parents for wanting to share the truffle omelet at Two Bakers, cause it was so cheesy and truffly good! In fact, my parents loved the food so much at Two Bakers that they\'ve already proclaimed they\'re gonna come back for more soon hahaha. Not that I\'m complaining ;)
A modernized version of the usual Ondeh Ondeh coated with coconut, the éclair was glazed with desiccated coconut and infused with Pandan fragrance.\n<br />Now let\'s get back to the rally and look forward to a 4-day work week!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
As we grow older, it gets harder to find like minded friends, maybe because we\'re more selective as well. Anw I\'m grateful to have found these boys. 😊 Finally tried the savory dishes at @twobakerssg on my third visit. Don\'t go expecting real bagels btw, but the pulled pork filling was pretty decent (think Chinese lor bak). Their tarts are still my favorite and this yuzu lemon one was quite refreshing. Got one for the road! Still loving the Key Lime and Mount Fuji (green tea ganache) tarts.
Always found the pastries here to be delightful and this one is no exception. The curd was softer and the crust more brittle than usual (and maybe that\'s because it came just fresh out from the kitchen and didn\'t have time to \"set\"), but together they tasted great anyway! I personally also think that anything with yuzu is bound to please!
At $9.80 nett, the portion is rather generous! The special sauce that coated these breast meat strips tasted like a mix of garlic and sweet chilli, and was so good I wish they served extra on the side for more dipping!
Never understood why the Risotto here are being served with two slices of baguette, but this was a pretty decent bowl of Risotto. They have nailed the creamy flavours and cheesiness just right for the one here. Mushrooms provide that earthiness that it needs, but the pumpkin cubes could be cooked softer. The baguette slices were light and crisp; delightful with the risotto spread atop, though could be a tad too carby to finish.
One of the SG50 specials, the Sambal Crabmeat Risotto isn\'t just your regular risotto; first taste and you would find it pretty unique as the different layers get layered out. A moment of crustacean flavour, thereafter comes a certain spiciness and next comes a creamy flavour, it is pretty intriguing, yet goes together very well. Perhaps it was the creaminess, but the Risotto was not exactly Sambal-flavoured, but more similar to a spicy laksa. Still a well-executed dish, and very value-for-money if ordered in the SG50 set which also includes a Ondeh Ondeh Eclair and Icy Minty Rose Latte at $20 nett.
The look of the beverage live up to the taste! I was attracted to it when I first saw it and it indeed didn\'t fail me. The matcha is not over powering and still manage to linger at the tastebuds for awhile. 
Supposed to be a cold beverage but well it\'s a cold afternoon so the staff offered to change it to a hot beverage for my mama! It\'s a sweet gesture and it\'s the first time they do it. It\'s smooth despite its made of skimmed milk. Not too worth. Worth a try. 
I\'m normally quite hesitant with matcha because it tends to be rather hit and miss. But I\'m glad I got the Mount Fuji, matcha with white chocolate tart, as it was really all sorts of wonderful. The matcha base was lightly aromatic but what really sealed the deal was the texture - quite like chocolate truffle being incredibly velvety and creamy. This, coupled with the chocolate crust, sweet earthy azuki beans and milky mousse makes for quite an orgasmic mouthful. Priced at $8.
The lime curd wasn\'t too tart and sour but I couldn\'t comprehend the iron metallic after taste. The fragrant crust does makes everything better, making it enjoyable. I like how the whip cream isn\'t all out sweet, which is often the pitfall of such lime/lemon desserts. Priced at $7.80.
The waitress tried her best to \"protect\" the egg but it still broke.
I changed my pasta from spaghetti to penne so the flavors could be more intensified. However, it lacks the creaminess I hoped for. Should another type of cheese be used instead of cheddar?
Anything that has \"truffle\" (oil) makes everyone happy. If the truffle used was shavings maybe this plate would be orgasmic.
Omit the whip cream to showcase more of the lime custard. Refreshing to the palate.
Maybe they should rename it as raspsody... Falling in love with this light and tart dessert.
The key lime tart here definitely did not disappoint and hit the right spot! It has a smooth, light curd and is packed with a lime punch, with cream on top to balance out the sweetness. It is utterly addicting!
Most people like to wind down and head out for lunch on Fridays, but I reckon it\'s all the more important to eat something happy on Mondays. Pretty meaty, this Spaghetti Vongole Alio Olio ($16.80), with a very generous amount of crab meat and clams. \n<br />PS. I\'m kicking myself for having been too lazy to snap a photo of our Le Grand Noir – a whole globe of dark chocolate mousse on a hazelnut feuilletine base – because it turned out damn good.
Someone is hooked on this 😜. Of all the tarts and pastries that we\'ve tasted, our favorites are the Key Lime tart (still), Mt Fuji, and the ondeh ondeh (pandas gula Melaka) eclair! Passion fruit tart was too runny and sweet. Their chocolate flavored sweets are just kinda cmi.. They really need to change the chocolate. Will continue thinking of these while I get through my insane emails. BAH.
Risotto seems to be the trending food these days and I\'m seeing it everywhere on menus! Anyway, I\'m loving the smokey-sweet butternut pumpkin cubes here that helps cut through the heaviness of the cream sauce. The toasted baguette slices also deserves mention for lending a crisp contrast to the otherwise mushy texture of this dish. Great comfort food as the menu says!
Taste was pretty good but a pity the crab meat was abit too rubbery. Guess they use the frozen kind instead of freshly cooked ones. 
I\'ve always passed by this place with nary a second glance, and finally stepped in to give the Ondeh Ondeh eclair ($6.80) a go. Well, that was pretty decent but it was actually the Mount Fuji ($8) that stole my heart. I\'m always skeptical of matcha-azuki cakes since they tended to be too harsh and powdery for my taste, but I really loved  the bittersweet balance of the matcha white chocolate ganache here. And that snowy cap of whipped cream is so prettyyyyy. What\'s more, I think I\'m in the good books of the chai gods because the espresso-spiked Dirty Chai Latte ($6) here was pretty darn good too! Whoop!
Salted caramel eclair. Nothing to complain about! Really good dessert options! 
Haven\'t had the tummy space to try everything, but what I tried I liked. The Strawberry Shortcake, with its amazingly delicate and light chantilly cream, simple vanilla sponge, and huge fresh strawberries, was a surprising delight. And don\'t get me started on the Mt Fuji of matcha and adzuki beans oh ho ho. I may hate on whipped cream so bad; but Two Bakers\' beautiful creations were good enough to tempt me to try.
Definitely my top pick for key lime tart now. This is so addictive that it keeps making me go back for more. The acidity from the key lime curd and the tartness from the pastry is just phenomenal. No words can describe just how much I absolutely love this tart from Two Bakers.
Instead of the usual cookie, coffee here is served with a cube of brownie which I thought was even better than some of the ones you actually pay for elsewhere. Shows the effort they put even into the small details :)
Apart from the white chocolate cream that tasted too milky for me, what laid underneath was surprisingly pleasant: a strong matcha flavored filling with just the right amount of sweetness, and a perfectly matched layer of fine azuki bean paste. 
Can\'t help comparing this to G Patiserrie\'s G Spot, and Two Baker\'s version gets my vote for its less-sweet praline layer and the extra ring of crunchy nuts decorating its base. Quite pricey, but I\'d say this cake is worthy of its $9.80 tag.
Can\'t remember what were those we ordered, but they were so gooooood. Key lime pie had the right balance of tangy and sweet, and loved that chocolate cake that was absolutely sinful but oh-so-good. Great ambience too! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Named as such for its Japanese influence. Chocolate-sable based tart with matcha mousse, azuki red beans and white chocolate mousse atop. Tart base was firm, and the matcha was tastefully bitter. The milky sweetness of the milk chocolate added just the right amount of sweetness to the matcha, and the azuki red beans provided an earthy touch. A must try for matcha lovers.
That chantilly cream is the bomb, my eyes literally 😍 the first mouth I took while the vanilla sponge was moist and light.Two Bakers really produce some fine dainty pastries that I couldn\'t  decide what to get 😞
With chefs who were culinary trained in Le Cordon Bleu, it\'s no wonder that they serve excellent pastries and desserts. Try their Key Lime Tart ($7.80) and you will know why this is one of my favourite dessert spots and one that I always rave about. The taste and texture were all spot on with the right sourness from the key lime and tartness from the crust. May the 4th (Force) be with You.
Sweet chocolate mousse vs refreshing sour tart, which will you prefer?
The key lime tart is not too sour and not too sweet. It\'s actually pretty perfect (My favorite of the 3). The salted caramel eclair and framboise are fantastic.
Very dark chocolatey but it tasted just right. Not too sweet and you can definitely finish one all by yourself. $9.8. Absolutely worth it!
Interesting combination. The duck seems very dry but it tasted just fine. The duck is a little too salty but tasted just nice with the pasta. If possible come during lunch as they have promotion. 
This cafe offers a range of desert. I\'m spoilt with choices...I end up choosing dessert with raspberry as I\'m a berry lover. Sweet with a tinge with sour. Most people will like it even though you can\'t take sour food. I would return for their chocolate based dessert!!!
Nice food, good ambience and excellent service. They just changed their menu recently. It\'s a pity that I didn\'t managed to try their Ah ma croque. Anyway their truffle omelet is great, mushroom lovers will love it! I added a snail sausage to it. The coffee is smooth and they offer skimmed here. Nice food with reasonable price. 
Very classy-looking and the display indicated the use of alcohol, so expectations were high. However, just like the moment when I peeled the wrapper off my first chocolate coin when I was a baby, I realised all that glitters is not gold. 3.4/5
Let\'s hope there\'s plenty of cake here too!
The crabmeat bits were deliciously salty and really soaked up the fragrant oil, being nicely firm and substantial instead of anorexically shredded. However, images of old-school 20 cent country erasers kept flashing in my mind as I chewed on the linguine. 3.3/5
My favorite of the lot and honestly quite good.  Not cloying sweet.  Will come back just for this.
Two Bakers serves decent pastries and is. Good addition to the Jalan Besar staples, CSHH, Windowsill and Bravery.
Starting to fall in love with lemon/lime tarts lately. The Key Lime Tart here hits all the right spots; that base that held up well yet not too hard, the zingy yet sweet lime curd and the cream to neutralize all those flavours. I was full but I just cannot stop myself from finishing it!
Their truffle fries are yummy and the coffee was average. However, I love the atmosphere of the place. Lovely for group hangouts. Would love to try their cakes the next time round when I am back. 
The amount of tartness is just right. I would say that it\'s sweet but the whipped cream helped to balance out the sweetness.
And TGIF! Omw to Malacca for a road trip, have a good weekend guys!
I remember how she was someone I looked up to, aspire to be when I grow up, she is always well put together and exudes compassion. Even when I am now many years older, the people who have impacted me have never changed. Knowing that she pursued baking and opened her own shop; something that requires plenty of courage imo.
Key. Lime. Pie. 
Lunch was at this newly opened cafe called Two Bakers along Horne Road. Very hipster cafe and localized cafe fare. I had the Croque Ah Ma which is the local version of Croque Madame with luncheon meat. Their current lunch promotion consists of a sandwich and tea/coffee and at $15.80, it\'s definitely value for money.
Discreetly sour beneath its innocent exterior, but with the right mixture of sweet so that you can maintain a decent conversation without feeling it is particularly anti-social. 3.75/5
I really liked how the crust was buttery without being overly greasy, but the chocolate filling was not quite ganache-y and decadent enough for me. The citrus-lime taste which came through subtly at the end of every mouthful kept things refreshing, so it was easy to finish this on your own without feeling jelat. Probably good for those who doesn\'t like their chocolate treat too rich.
The layered sponge cake is filled and topped with whipped cream and strawberry slices that are not too sweet. This old-fashioned cake is soft and moist, but just a little too fine and feathery, it will be perfect if the texture can be more sponge-cake-like shortcake. 
A combination of crisp pastry, luscious chocolate cream, and dark chocolate glaze with sablee crumble. The dark chocolate eclair at Two Bakers is smooth, silky and not too sweet. 
http://danielfooddiary.com/2014/10/21/twobakers
The competition at Horne Road may be stiff, especially with the likes of The Bravery and Windowsill Pies all situated at the same stretch. You probably can tell from their name that they serve pretty decent cakes and pastries, such as their light Strawberry Shortcake and their beautiful Eclairs, but they also serve pretty honest and huge all-day breakfast as well. The owners are very on-the-ball, and willing to start a conversation and gather some feedback on the food, which shows their sincerity in serving customers the very best. A new spot that you should consider visiting around Jalan Besar.
Had their Salted Caramel Eclaire, Key Lime Tart, Le Chocolate Noir. Le Chocolate Noir is 😍👍. #twobakers #burpple
Newly opened Two Bakers is an artisanal bakery cafe serving up specialty coffee using blends from Strangers\' Reunion, sweet cakes and savoury food. Using only French butter and top notch ingredients, their pastries are made fresh daily by Le Cordon Bleu Paris trained chefs. Bestsellers include their salted caramel éclair, Le Chocolat Noir and moist carrot cake. Their strawberry shortcake is also delightfully refreshing and perfect for a tea-time dessert. For more savoury options, you can go for various brunch options, beef stew, Asian pulled-pork sandwich, or soups. (But of course, end with dessert!)
Two Bakers uses blends from Stranger\'s Reunion. Their cuppa was nutty and earthy with a medium body, which makes it comforting to sip in between desserts to kill off the sweetness.
This was so large two guys could not finish it! The large slices of bread were crusty at the sides, hiding an equally massive chunk of Luncheon Meat in between! Topped off with melted cheese and a sunny side-up, it was a pretty comforting dish that could be replicated at home. We loved their fries though; hand-cut with skin on. Pretty chunky and well-seasoned in salt to flavour!
Fluffy Vanilla Sponge Cake sandwiched with light and fresh pastry cream with strawberry chunks in between. A light-tasting sweet treat that was pretty refreshing even as a dessert.
Found that the puff pastry was a tad dry but was not too bothersome. It was well-filled with sweet-salty goodness, which made it so good!
A simple spacious cafe with simple home bake cakes and savouries coming soon

So refreshing and perfect for the sweltering afternoon heat. A watermelon block wedged in between rose scented cream, crispy almond wafer? and fresh berries- this gluten free dessert has a good balance of flavour and texture.

A very generous portion if it!

Interesting innovation of traditional kueh with fresh slice of watermelon :)
Again one of my favorite cafe!
A bite of the crunchy watermelon releases gratifying hydration, whilst elsewhere the sticky, nutty hazelnut dacquoise pouts as it bats its eyelashes flirtatiously at your jaw. 3.9/5

It\'s a pleasure to bring them out for desserts and coffee after dinner. :) nice environment with cool tarts and cakes! \n<br />#twobaker #wati8today #dessert #tarts #limetarts #yuzutarts #bakery #foodstagram #foodie #foodporn #jiakpahliao #ahpuijiak #burpple
The vanilla sponge and almond crumble are completely coated by the soft and pillowy mousse and the texture of the different elements brings immense satisfaction with every bite\n<br />The dainty raspberry bits surrounding the bottom of the cake and the raspbery flavoured petal make its presentation even more exquisite
One can easily sense the efforts of the baker to ensure the cake is beautifully accentuated in every aspect to capture your attention right away
\'Twas a quiet cosy cafe with very appealing desserts 😍 •\n<br />#whati8today #exploresingapore #foodiesg #8dayseat #sgfoodie #iweeklyfood #foodstagram #foodporn #burpple #hungrygowhere #entertainerwithjo #entertainersg @entertainersg @burpple @hungrygowhere #twobakers #matchalatte #latteart #matcha #cafesg #cafehoppingsg @twobakerssg
Almond crumble. Fresh blueberry compote ($8)\n<br />😋\n<br />How to not love this beauty? The compote may escape with a little blast 💦 not too sweet and cheese is not overpowering yet gao! 😋\n<br />Purple Gold: Lavender infused chocolate ganache. Caramel ganache. Chopped roasted almond. Caramel tuile. ($7.80)\n<br />😋\n<br />Just when u tot that its just another chocolate-caramel tart - NO! We were pleasantly surprised by the fragrant tint of lavender 😌 once again not too sweet for this person without a sweet tooth. #meNutsaboutNuts\n<br />😋\n<br />Good place to visit for after-meal angmoh desserts\n<br />😋\n<br />#notsureifstayingnearbyisgoodformywaistline #guysstopmakingmeFAT #happybellyMe #Burpple #burpplesg #dessertsforbreakfast #nomondayblues #idontdeservetobeFAT 😭

One of my favourite dessert place. Will always drop by the cafe if I passby their shop. Blueberry ricotta cake is good. Overall the cake is good 😋😋
🎉\n<br />1. Key Lime Tart ($7.80)\n<br />2. Mount Fuji ($8)\n<br />3. Chocolate Truffle ($2.50/pc)\n<br />4. Cafe Hazelnut ($8)\n<br />My personal favourite was the Mount Fuji. Matcha mousse topped with Azuki beans and a layer of sweet cream. A must order for Japanese cafe hoppers! 🎌🇯🇵 #burpple #sgfood #sgfoodie #instafood #foodphotography #sgfoodlover #fooddiary #foodstagram #foodieat #sgfoodlover #foodporn #foodie #foodlover #sgcafe #dessert #matcha #twobakers #tart
This was simplicity at its best. \n<br />Served cold, the firm soba carried the distinct truffle taste well complemented by the oven baked portobello mushroom. Mixed in the egg and it add another dimension. Loved how it was refreshingly flavourful. #burpple #burrplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #excafesg  #foodieSG #foodgasm #whati8today  #nomnomsg #sgeats #sgcafefood  #onthetable #sgfoodie #igsgfoodies

Fuji ($8) matcha, azuki beans, white chocolate ganache and a snow capped resemblence whip cream in a chocolate sablèe tart base.

The set consists of a pasta and lemon tea which is not my cup of tea and I requested to top up for a coffee. \"No sorry can\'t\"\n<br />\"I will pay for the difference\"\n<br />\"Sorry the set drink cannot be changed\"\n<br />\"Even if I top up? I don\'t drink lemon tea\"\n<br />\"Ya cannot change\" *walks out
Like an art piece, but a delicious one. I can understand why their cakes sell fast. #cakes #dessert #matcha #redbean #yuzu #sweets #delicious #sgcafe #monday #cafehopping #jalanbesar #twobakers #burpple #instafood
Love the moist chocolate cake, but wouldn\'t say the same for the ultra rich vanila buttercream.
Hazelnut dacquoise, rose cream with watermelon &amp; berries. #yum
Fuji (SGD$9.80)... Yes, i meant the cake. Mound of fluffy ivory cream covering a crusty chocolate base (the foot of the mountain) and soft matcha cake in between, burying gems of azuki (red beans)... Sweetened lips are now ready to kiss the weekend goodbye to make way for a brand new week. #foodie #foodblog #fotd #foodgasm #foodgram #foodstagram #foodporn #igfood #instafood #foodnation #foodventure #instadesserts #desserts #dessertporn #dessertgram #instasweets #cake #mtfuji #cafesg #sgcafe #twobakerscafe #thearcticstar #foodpic #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burrple #flowers

The cake itself wasn\'t too sweet, sweetness only comes from the vanilla buttercream. Love the melt-in-your-mouth Rasberry coated meringue •
More than something savory, I have craving for good coffee and dessert to perk me up. Found ourselves here armed with papers and magazine, and parking coupons. Sipped on my Flat White and his Mocha. A nice, cool cafe with ambience so relaxing that I forgot to snap a shot of The Big Eater that we ordered to share, as we indulged in the  goodness of the tender sausage, tasty bacon, crispy harshbrown, warm toasts with butter, garden salad, mushrooms and cheery sunnyside-ups. Left the cafe with Le Chocolat Noir lingering on our tongues... #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #burpple #sgcafe #sgcafes #cafehopping #cafesg #sg #sgfoodtrend #sgcafehopping #yummy #igsg #sgcafefood #instafood #cafehoppingsg #cafes #Singapore #whati8today #sgig #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #foodstagram #sgfooddiary #instafoodsg #twobakers #foodgasm #lechocolatnoir #SGMakanDiary #sgmakanplaces
Soursop Cheesecake, Malibu-infused Vanilla Cake, Meringue, Soursop Gel, Sable Crumble and Desiccated Coconut. Liked how they went all innovative with Soursop; a fruit rarely found in desserts despite being a tropical fruit. Plating was based off a more \"garden-like\" feel, with loads of green and flower-shaped meringue. Soursop Cheesecake came with half of the sphere being soursop and the other half being the cheesecake; overall felt more cheesecake but enhanced by the soursop gel on the side, while the sable crumbles act as a crumble base for the cheesecake. Particularly liked the vanilla pound cake that was surprisingly aromatic as it fills up the tongue with flavour. Overall an attempt on a plated dessert where effort can be felt, but somehow lacked a bit of character. Two Baker\'s plated dessert is only available as a special on Fridays and Saturdays from 6pm; note the time and days so you wouldn\'t make a wasted trip down for them!

Liked the buttery pastry but it is the ganache plus the caramel that I personally find it overly sweet. #tarts #teabreak #teawithfriends #sgfoodie #burpple #opensnap #openricesg #dessert #tfjsg50
Cooked al-dente, the texture great, meat of the crab was sweet, altogether a great dish out together for sg50.

Crispy on the outside and cooked to perfection on the inside. Sprinkled with black pepper and served with a truffle-mayo made in-house. It\'s no wonder this is a staple at every table.

Pitstop for today. Sigh kinda disappointed with the tart 😖 #pear #tart #foodie #foodstagram #food #afternoontea #burpple #cafesg #cafe
Love the Matcha White Chocolate with Azuki Beans inside! 😋😋
😄
Try their Key Lime Tart ($7.80) and you will know why this is one of my favourite dessert spots and one that I always rave about. The taste and texture were all spot on with the right sourness from the key lime and tartness from the crust. May the 4th (Force) be with You.
Blessed weekend 😎
Just the aroma alone is enough to make me giddy with anticipation; almost forgot to snap a shot! Each bite was full of a rounded earthy fragrance. Bread is freshly baked, and it was a wise choice to use unsalted butter. Snail sausages were an add-on, as were skinny latte. These set the stage for an excellent hearty brunch, and a long overdue catch up. #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodporn #instafood #foodstagram #twobakers #latergram #burpple
