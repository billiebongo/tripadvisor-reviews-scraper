Having had my fair share of hotcakes, Habitat’s Stuffed Berries Hotcake ($15) was simple and well-executed. Though the taste does not differ much from the other renditions that I have tried, I thought that the use of cream cheese was a welcoming change. Hitting a balance of fluffiness, the hotcake was sweetly harmonized with a right amount of cream cheese while the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and walnuts were able to provided a much-needed crunch to the dish. The hotcake was also not overly dense and kept moist with a nice dose of maple syrup. However, I would prefer a more crisp exterior.
A classic breakfast with large portion of scrambled egg, maple glazed bacon, chicken sausage, grilled tomato, mini hashbrowns. Simple but filling.
Habitat Coffee is one of the cafes I frequent when I need to get the caffeine in me fixed! Love their red velvet cake, so awesome! Not to mention, great service too!
a stack of house batter pancakes with generous servings of caramelised bananas and crushed walnuts. The pancakes were moist without being too stodgy but eating it alone can be too much. It\'s suppose to come with cranberry sauce but Lily doesn\'t like, so ours is without.
Interesting combi and worth a try! Also ordered the ocean linguine. Pretty disappointed with the texture of the pasta - undercooked. Returned it, got a little softer but still undercooked and dry overall. Coffee is perfect with 3 shots! #habitatcoffee
All I remember today, is sweet, sweet and sweet. My excitement faded into nought after the first bite, cause the extreme dose of sugar was blinding. The pudding had a lovely moist texture, with whole soft dates, which was lovely and commendable. Though it lacked the caramelized sticky touch, the texture was good enough to place it amongst the top of my list. Too bad it was just all too sweet. Suffice to say we ran out of ice cream to help balance out all that sugar.
Simply put, my non-pancake-nor-sweet-foods mum couldn\'t stop grabbing forkfuls of it. Push away all the aesthetics, and what you\'re left with is a simple, stunning pancake topped with fresh berries and a dollop of cream cheese. The pancake\'s one of the softest, moistest and fluffiest I\'ve tried, nicely sweetened and scented with vanilla. I like how only the edges have that browned crisp, with most of the pancake staying light and fluffy. Only gripe is the cream cheese, which though delish makes it feel and taste a tad cheap.
Needless to say, this Eggs Benedict is good even if they use toast rather than brioche or English muffins.
Looking for some brunch? Love English breakfast ? Wait no more because Habitat Coffee has an awesome dish called BIG BEN ! For just 15 bucks?!?!?! A healthy yummy brunch with liquid egg, 100g sausage, bacon, hashbrown and a slice of yummy crispy toast!
Looking for some unique pasta? Singaporean type of pasta? Wait no more! Because habitat this tasty chilli crab pasta that will satisfy your cravings! Affordable much at 16 bucks! It\'s really huge portion ! Can be shared with 2.
Not knowing what to have for lunch, I went to Habitat Coffee and ordered a Cajun Chicken Bites and Shepherd\'s Pie. The Cajun Chicken Bites taste good with the honey mustard sauce but the Shepherd Pie was rather normal though the potato portion was good.
[$15] Had one of the most satisfying Truffle Scrambled over at Habitat and just the thought of it left me wanting more already! Savoury with a tinge of sweetness from the cherry tomatoes 🍒\n<br />~\n<br />Overall, IMO: 3.9/5
Cafe Habitat in a neighbourhood in Upper Thomson populated with cafe-goers. From salads, sandwiches, pastas to most vitally, brunch, Habitat Coffee does it all.
Never a wrong choice after a hard day of work! Served with mantou and chunky crab meat. $16.
Three girlfriends and I shared two sides and one dessert, had our own drink/coffee and main: the damage? Less than $35 per person. (And a whole lot of calories too it seems but they\'re all skinny so that\'s ok 😅)\n<br />I added bacon to my Shrooms with hollandaise-doused poached eggs chilling on brioche toast and sautéed mushrooms, and while it may not be the most fantastic-tasting Eggs Benedict variation out there, the sheer size of the dish more than makes up for the lack of flavour complexity. Same for most of their dishes there - I have a friend has quite a \'healthy\' appetite and let\'s just say \'Ana\' (her nickname for her stomach, last name \'Conda\'), was a happy girl at the end of the meal.
I rarely revisit cafes, but since Habitat revamped its menu, we felt a second visit was in order. The new items impressed, and we loved them all! Recommended: chilli crab linguine, pulled beef sandwich &amp; this gorgeous Instagram-worthy berry hotcake. Third visit TBC! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A runny good day with my mummy who\'s happily enjoying her Eggs Benedict here. Am happy to see that Habitat Coffee has spruced up this dish, and it\'s much richer in flavour as compared to their previous version! At $13, this is still one of the best value-for-money Eggs Benedict in SG.
Despite the longer than usual wait this turn out really well. Worth a try
Everything tasted very meh, including the drinks. Disappointing after almost an hour\'s wait. Upside was that the staff were pretty nice. 
Back here again after my too-sweet fixture, this time with a taste for the savoury! Grilled salmon teriyaki ($16) was an unexpected gem; the honey teriyaki sauce was definitely a taster - perfect blend of sweet and savoury. Salmon was fresh and delivered just the right amount of crisp, definitely worth a try! 
It\'s a new item in their menu, which makes them the third cafe selling such hotcakes in Singapore. (Could this possibly be the new \'in\' cafe food?)\n<br />I think I\'m really a fan of them; I love the crisp exterior and fluffy insides! Though the one at Paddy Hills is slightly more fragrant, I like how this is more wallet-friendly haha. 😁
I immediately knew I had to order this when I saw it on the menu. Granted, I have not tried Paddy Hills\' rendition of it, thus i am unable to compare. (Anybody wants to bring me to Paddy Hills to eat?) After all, only 3 cafes serve this dish that I know of. (Strangers\' Reunion being the 3rd one)
Served with butter, maple syrup and chocolate sauce, this waffle is anything but pedestrian. 
The stuffed berry hotcakes was a winner for me. A perfect balance between the berries and cream cheese, with the stuffed berry filling being a nice touch. Generous portions of berries and the cream cheese made this one a filling portion. Perhaps it was a wrong move ordering both sweet treats together, the churros were sugar overload!!! Churros were too caramelized to enjoy the crisp, it was more of a sugar explosion. Stuffed berry hotcakes are a hit, but churros you can give a miss.
Pretty decent all day breakfast selection from Eggs Benedict to American Breakfast style. Remember to order a cup of coffee to go with it 
#whatisexamseven \n<br />Amazing House-Made Churros($9): Soft fried dough fritters, slightly crispy on the outside yet soft in the inside! Coated with cinnamon sugar and served with Chef\'s warm chocolate ganache. A sweet treat to chase away exams stress! But really in no mood to study 😵 One more day! 💪
Located along the thomson road (known for its stretch of resturants, coffee shops and cafes located there),this cafe has been around for quite a number of years and also been on my to-go-list for a long time. Decided to go down one fine sunday and reached around 2pm for a really late brunch, but the place was still quite crowded. Lucky us managed to get a table outside without waiting for too long. Service was average (we had to wait for quite a long time) but the food was not bad,especially their pancakes! Items featured in the photo includes: MaMa\'s Banana Pancakes $10/The Big Ben $14/Eggs Tomato Relish $15. Verdict: The food is not bad, but quite normal though (not really a fan of the tomato dish though it looked quite tempting..) but otherwise the pancakes were quite good! 3.50/4.0.
(7.90) It looked so huge and gorgeous in the display case as it was 3-tiered, but unfortunately the slice was a bit thin. The cake was nice though, crumbly and moist. would have been better with more cream cheese icing and a thicker slice!
Some times all you need is love and coffee. \n<br />Habitat uses Carpenter\'s Blend, a chocolaty and medium bodied with a nutty finish. A cup of Vanilla Latte with their beans may be too sweet for my liking, will just for a non-flavoured ones.
Easily the best I\'ve ever had; will return for more! 
Habitat is one of the first few cafes that I started to write about back in 2012. It\'s was only a few months old when I first visited it. I got to know the boss and I must say that the cafe was progressing quite a fair bit! I especially love this pie which recipe comes from the owner\'s mum! 
// Don\'t fancy the hollandaise sauce for the egg ben here.
Eggs Benedict on sundried tomato bread. Not too bad! But I prefer the eggs Benedict at \'ON THE TABLE\' 
🌼Rate: 6.5/10\n<br />The Big Ben was okok and the egg benedict was total plain. Probably different taste buds But yea. The truffle fries was normal too and overall price was $35. 🐼
Consistency was just right. LOVE truffle fries so this has become my favourite :-)
(Sticky date pudding with butterscotch &amp; vanilla ice cream) $12 for sugar rush!
Priced 
Brown gravy, cheese and fries... just realised not much cafés serves this. This is good but without the curd cheese it wasnt as good as the one from seasons :)
The cream cheese on this red velvet is good.... the cake was moist but could be more moist to ace it
Spent a total of roughly $33 for 2 person. We ordered a regular flat white, hot chocolate, big ben breakfast with an extra sausage top up as well as banana pancakes with scramble eggs :) The cafe is rather crowded and but we got our table within 20 minutes but the waiting time for food was really too long.. The beverages were not to my liking as i prefer sweeter coffee than the bitter ones :( The food however were awesome although i would have love the pancakes more if there\'s more of those sweet banana sauce 😆 Overall experience : 6/10 
Matcha was surprisingly not too gelat! Made for a really interesting meal, the salmon was really generous too 👍
This isn\'t the best waffles, but for what\'s it\'s worth, I am contented. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. It\'s just lack of the smell and taste. Personally just felt that it\'s lacking in that waffle-taste. 
Its aglio oglio style, so the white wine taste isnt too strong, but its still aromatic overall! Seafood are juicy and crunchy!
Truffle fries. Black Velvet Cake. Super duper delicious waffles, with a generous amount of good ol\' maple syrup and chocolate sauce for you indecisive people out there (like me! Ehems),and it\'s perfect enough for me. Loved how simple orders like this, still lingers in my mind up till now. And i swear, the waffles may looked pretty plain but, it\'s one of the best i\'ve tasted! A cafe that is pretty packed with human traffic, but there must be a reason why they\'re infested with all the human right? Hmm. And oh! They brew real good coffee as well. Good place for coffee lovers and, how bout adding a lil spice to the long talks with a friend, by having their not so clichè cake, Black Velvet! 
Eggs Tomato Relish - tangy tomato goodness with runny eggs, bacon and sourdough toast. Good enough to make me want breakfast for dinner 😋
Truffle shuffle.. Truffle shuffle or shuffle truffle? One of the best Truffle Fries I have eaten! 
The Big Ben: The chicken cheese sausage is probably the best I have ever tried! However the mini potato pancake wasn\'t really tasty.
Truffle fries were yum especially if you\'re craving some and you\'re in the area! Reasonably price for a mess-tin full! Ambience is lovely but limited menu choices :-( had their seafood aglio as well which was ok. 
I think this photo won\'t do justice what how this cafe offers! I felt the portion of the food was filling for me &amp; the churros is amazing. Be sure to check with them if the churros is ready because it\'s a popular menu item &amp; it\'s normally cleared up really fast. My friend tried their waffles here, also had high praises for it. Be sure to pay a visit to this cafe! No regrets - ☺️
Caramelized bananas and pancakes, you can\'t go wrong with this combination. I love how the pancakes are soft and tasty, not to mention it comes with quite a generous portion of bananas too. Do be prepared to queue on weekends though. But it\'s worth the wait as they serve decent food that are reasonably priced.
Cafe hopping friday afterschool by myself cos.. Well i just felt like it 😂 Perks? Free wifi &amp; the cakes aren\'t that expensive. (No idea about the other things) Tried the chocolate truffle cake w/rum. Not bad for the pricing!  (got abit sick of it when i had 1/4 left to finish) $3.90. Mocha was not bad too. 
Chicken fred sandwich is delicious~ didnt expect that the bread itself is soft and the ingredient is fresh too! Should try it! They serve you with wonderful and friendly manner;) thumbs up! 
The fusion of the enticing rummy eggs and the richness of the tomato relish filled bacons, with crispy crusted bread makes this a winning formula! ($15)
Warm and cozy cafe good, for a catch up with old friends over freshly brewed coffee and delicious cakes. Not forgetting the fine coffee art 😄
Heard about the hyped for their truffle fries. Tried and thought it was decent. The truffle oil infused wasn\'t strong enough. 
Always like sticky date pudding as my dessert whenever it is available on the menu. The one at habitat was good if you\'re into very sweet cakes! 😋 
Our 2nd stop yesterday: Habitat Coffee! Heard that their truffle fries are good and for $8 nett, it was quite a good deal!
Had this for dinner after a buffet lunch on the same day. Managed to finish everything though!
Really good Eggs Benedict, Big Breakfast with cute-good tasting hash browns and Macadamia Latte to top it off! 
Been visiting since it opened years ago and I\'m having mixed feelings on its increasing popularity; getting toooo crowded but it means they will stay in business :p #cafe #brunch #cafehopping #weekend #yum #habitatcoffee
The air ventilation was a little poor (fries smelling hair) but the food portion was good
Take shitake pasta (mushrooms with aglioolio linguine) with cheesy sausage ( add on +$2/3) personally feel that the pasta is a tad too oily and not to my liking. This is one of my favorite cafe but only find their brunch items good, especially the eggs Benedict. The add on sausage was good though, same as the one served in The Big Ben.
It\'s awesome.  Ask for both the Cinnamon and Tabasco ones.
The plate of Big Ben was good - with hashbrowns, scrambled eggs on english fluff, the usual veggies, cheese sausage and their hollandaise sauce to top the dish off. Indeed one of the nicest brunch around with latte to savour!
Thick chocolate cake with choco bits at the side, pretty good!
Lovely coffee art; and who would miss out coffee at Habitat\'s, right?
30mins worth the wait, it gives you quality time w the one you went and save your stomach for the good.
The Eggs Benedict tasted pretty normal. Food are all reasonably priced from S$10-15 for their brunch menu. Truffle fries were normal. S$7/serving. Heard that their mushrooms were really yummy, haven\'t got to try yet...  
I ordered \"he will guide you\" which is actually a shepherd\'s pie with toast. It is not a huge potion but the potato taste really fine. The toast is also very crunchy. However I find the pricing a little high for a small potion like this. The atmosphere and ambience was good, the staffs were friendly too. 
Very popular cafe during the we weekend with a queue even before they start operating! 
Love the taste of black pepper. Ok I love anything with black pepper. [bonus!]
Too much of Red Velvet? Here\'s Black Velvet for a change.
Weekend brunch always would be packed.Good service. \n<br />Poached eggs with shrooms good match! \n<br />Truffles fries sedap!
One of the better ones in Singapore. Thumbs up for generous portions! | ★★★★☆
Rich and chocolatey with a crunchy hazelnut bits in the crust. Caramel latte was lovely and service was oh-so-friendly too. We had lotsa work to do but it was fun doing it at Habitat :) I have a sneaky feeling this is gon be our fav work-cafe from now on. 
Was alright, but the bread was a little top hard. Loved the truffle fries though!
Love how strong the rum in the cake is. Always an alcoholic in me.
This is great! 
A sunny day means it\'s brunch time again! #saturdaymornings #cafehopping #brunch
Would be great if I can have a cuppa now.. But all I have is instant coffee 😅😛 guess I will have to make do with that for now ... Food coma is hitting me 💤
- Sun-date - great to see blue skies and the scorching sun!! .It was a nice weather for a Sunday after a whole week of gloominess and haze. Here\'s us bingeing on ice cream and coffee!
Spotted a nice cafe @ Thomson! #dinner for 3; Chick Bo Spaghetti • Hello Truffle Fries • Belgian Waffle w Belgian Choco Ice-cream • Tiramisu Cake • Ice Mocha • Hot Tiramisu 😋

Not so great sticky date pudding for $12. They just microwaved a banana cake, drizzled caramel sauce atop, and placed a scoop of ice-cream atop. Taste was ok but not worth $12.

One more day to the end of 2016!
Here\'s the stuffed berries hotcake, warm, thick, fruity, nutty and comfy in the tummy 😌\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple @burpple #hungrygowhere @hungrygowhere #hotcake @habitatcoffee #habitatcoffee
Unique and oh so good! The sea salt caramel buttercream blends so well with the carrot cake. Every bite is heavenly!
Died in this amazingly delicious pasta that definitely seared away my taste buds, adventure did pay off this time I guess 😂
Churro-licious in every sense of the word. Dipped into choc ganache - one of the best churros I have had in a while. \n<br />Crispy on the out, yet retaining that simple soft dough fluff inside. Such a great improvement from my 1st visit 2 years back (and yes it was quite bad to take me so long to return). New menu at Habitat reviewed and updated on the blog. herpenandfork.com.sg
Scrambled salmon with toast. Not as satisfying. Not as nice.
Belgian Waffle w/ 2 scoops of ice-cream. Definitely worth it. Love earl grey ice-cream.

TRUFFLE PASTA again? Then again, its not possible for me to avoid this dish when im in my Habitat! This truffle pasta from Habitat Coffee is really good though! Flooded with so much truffle cream that had such strong truffle aroma and taste, together with a generous amount of different varieties of mushroom (honestly the whole dish was nearly covered with it and this really gave this dish a good texture and taste!), al dente linguine that was pleasant to sink your teeth into and topped with spinach! Dont underestimate the spinach though, for its texture gave this dish more twists and not so boring as to have to plough through truffle and cream throughout the whole dish and also made it easier to enjoy! Oh, not forgetting the cheese flakes that were sparsely sprinkled on top too! The balance of ingredients were really well done! Definitely one of the popular choices of Habitat Coffee?
Yumm 🍴🍳
White Truffle Scrambled Eggs with chunks of Salmon on a whole grain toast and roasted potatoes... finally something that isn\'t pasta eh? But the truffle fragrance was just so good... in certainly in my Habitat! \n<br />On a side note, really looking forward to waking up to runny eggs on toasts in a nice Cha Chaan Teng for a few days! T -2 to the Land of Good Food!

While nothing special, the company makes up for it!!
Met my former Artillery coursemate Ray. Besides a good updates about ourselves, I introduced him this House-made Churros. \n<br />Both of us liked this item it\'s so delicious. Crispy and sweet (coated with cinnamon sugar)... And the sweetness simply escapades with the Chef\'s warm chocolate ganache. \n<br />#churros #churro #habitat #bistro #cafefood #meetup #goodstuff #localeat #eatsg #eatlocal #foodporn #foodstagram 
($17) If you love the sauce to the point you just want to eat it off the spoon on its own then this is made for you. Otherwise it may be too much of a good thing. \n<br />Totally maxed out my carb quota of the day but that didn\'t stop me from getting ice cream, ops. \n<br />#sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgcafehopping #pasta #chillicrab #fusion #burpple
Fried crunchy chicken bites. Can give it a try. 
Available at @HabitatCoffee
Regular size cappuccino for $4.90. Coffee was aromatic and not too acidic. However, the only down side was that the coffee was not hot enough. Within 5 mins of serving, coffee turned cold and needed to be finished quickly. 
😆 #brunchdate #waffle #sgcafe #trufflefries #burpple
I\'m hooked and I cannot hide it.
The beef was slowcooked for 9 hours, making it easy to chew and loved the house BBQ sauce that was drizzled on top. Satisfying brunch!
😪😪 #thefoodjournalist #burppletastemaker
Not bad!
However, the service and ambience at Habitat Coffee more than make up for it. Plus, their organic hot chocolate [$4.90] and chicken pops [$9] are definitely worth the trip back 👍🏼 #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #habitatcoffee #chocolateart

May Day Brunch !!#burpple
Peppery satisfaction with the fresh prawns
Really quite a scrumptious plateful for a lazy brunch 
$15
$12
#cafehoppingsg #burpple
I had the BLT (hence the title of the post), my friends had the shepherd\'s pie and salmon sandwich something (🙊🙊🙊) and all had good reviews pretty much! ☺️
Served with chocolate ganache, $9. Texture was great nicely crisp on the outside and soft on the inside but there was a distinctive taste of oil (the kind that tastes like it was re-fried many times?). So nope nope nope!!! I\'m hoping it\'s just a one time thing but I won\'t be back anytime soon. 
For a lighter option, sandwiches are also available at around $8. For brunch lovers, brunch is served till 5.30pm on weekdays. All day brunch on sat and sun 🎉 Closed on Mondays. #sgfoodsteps #sgcafe #sgfoodie #burpple #sgfoodiary #cafehoppingsg
By habitat coffee. They are located just above habitat  coffee.
A little too crunchy and lacking in chewiness for my liking.
Banana &amp; blueberries can be better tho. \n<br />Memo &amp; picts credit: Memo of OTKNPR, dated 10 Dec 2014.
Although not very distinctive but still is able to stand out from most other normal blend. \n<br />Memo &amp; picts credit: Memo of OTKNPR, dated 10 Dec 2014.
Not much as changed but does makes me feel older as most of the crowd here are young teenagers. \n<br />Memo &amp; picts credit: Memo of OTKNPR, dated 10 Dec 2014.

Why else would you go to habitat for??
Decent attempt :)
Food Art!
Chit-chat &amp; drink coffee :)
Throwback to a few weeks ago! Second visit to Habitat Coffee. Great ambience and service :) Their dishes were quite satisfying except that maybe the smoked salmon was a little too salty for my tastebuds. Overall, it was worth visiting again!
Simply love everything on this plate! 
So so 
We had waffles with scoops of sea salt caramel and bailey\'s ice cream! The waffles was yummzzz. Sea salt caramel was nice and the baileys was really quite strong.
Good and inexpensive brunch at Habitat! I had tomato relish with Irish cream coffee, both were delicious. Eggs were a bit runny though.

Here\'s one for the good ol\' days. #dumbanddumber #latteart #coffee #habitatcoffee #barista
Not too sweet. 
#toooldforthisinsomniashitthingy
Food was good but the portion size was too small for me.
My virgin affogato experience. Espresso had a nutty and chocolatey aroma. Good mix of creamy, sweet and bitter. Would come back for more affogato but probably will try the other coffee for their latte art.

Another yum egg benny! 
Very yum and affordable! 
Quite a big portion w a generous scoop of vanilla gelato. Warm sticky date 👍
Unique flavors of coffee, specially like the macadamia flavor 👍
🍰☕️
It packs a ton of flavours and goes so well with those warm crusty sourdough bread which we used to soak up all the tomato goodness and mop everything clean!
I should feel happy but somehow still a lil frustrated.
Whether it\'s etching or free pour it takes time and lots of practice to perfect it. I hope people take a moment to appreciate and not easily criticise the effort done by all the baristas out there. #habitatcoffee #coffeeart #latteart #coffee #barista

I\'m a big casualty during the Céline friends and family sale so this downtime is much welcomed. #coffee
Love the location, love the service and friendliness of the waiters and waitresses there! :) especially the variety of sinful indulgence! 
...but first, let me have coffee.
Always love catching up with friends over good food! ((:\n<br />#burpple

Probably the only type of coffee I drink. This was mochaly delicious! Maybe the sweet rain helped. (Dear burnt-out engineer, the new Burpple looks really good! I like what you did there 😉)

Pours like this is what keeps me going despite being mentally exhausted. Really need a break from working non-stop. #latteart #coffee
Finally a cafe I would go back to. Cosy ambience on the second level, and most importantly- good coffee. Try their banana pancakes too!
