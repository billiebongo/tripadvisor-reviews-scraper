🍔8.5/10 🍔\n<br />.\n<br />Who knew a vegan burger could be this good? You can never tell that the juicy, crispy batter that you are biting into is actually a soy patty! Placed on a bed of lettuce with mushrooms, pepper and a mushroom cream sauce, this is a burger well worth the trip to Eunos. Couldn\'t care less about the fries though; I usually love seaweed fries but these were meh at best
VeganBurg…man this place blew me away. I\'m 100% not joking when I say that the seaweed fries had this impeccable crisp. It was astounding! Needless to say, I was hooked onto it. 
made both into sets.
I ordered the cracked mayo with seaweed fries and it was amazing !! Honestly, there\'s not even a slightest hint of it being vegan and if healthiness taste like this I am up for it !! Shoutout to students : Flash your Student Pass from 2pm onwards during weekdays and get 15% off ✨
Crispy yet juicy GMO-free soy patty on a bed of fresh lettuce, dripping with egg-free and dairy-free creamy sauce, topped with caramelized onions, lightly sauteed button mushrooms and zesty pepper st
this being my vegan virgin try, I was really surprised as to how good it tasted!! despite my picture only showing fries, you can substitute them for broccoli! although they wrote there seaweed fries, didn\'t really taste much of the seaweed so don\'t expect McDonald greasy shaker fries here!! \n<br />I ordered the creamy mushroom which I highly highly recommend ESP if you are a mushroom fan it was so good 👌🏻 ambience is great and it\'s a 5 minute walk from Eunos mrt, def recommend
Sgd 6.90/ 10.80 (make it a meal)\n<br />First time to try this Vegetarian burger meal joint by VeganBurg, so I must try one of the bestseller menu which is their Cracked Mayo Burger + Seaweed Fries + Cooler (guava flavor?\n<br />They claimed that this burger is high in minerals like iron, calcium and magnesium by using an organic whole wheat bun, garden fresh lettuce, cholesterol free mayo and the main ingredient GMO-free soy patty. That sounds a very healthy 🍔 burger.\n<br />The overall taste was divine. Sometimes I have this notion that vegan meals would be less flavorful and all sorts of less taste. And now that I tried again this vegan burger joint me and my tummy was really surprised and happy to try them. Worth for a next visit soon 😋!\n<br />Recommendation:🍴🍴
Bought quite a few burgers and sides. The vegan sausage was actually quite good and the burgers are really tasty. Would recommend for people to try veganburg for a change of their normal fast food. Not only it\'s healthy, it\'s very delicious 😋
Creamy Shrooms - crispy, juicy soy-based patty topped with cream sauce, caramelised onions and greens, nestled within their signature fibre-fueled buns. \n<br />A wholesome and nutritious meal that did not fail satisfy the palate.
Currently my favourite vegetarian/vegan burger in Singapore, still eating my way through Singapore hehehe 😚 This burger was absolutely delish, with the crispy burger and creamy mushrooms. Shout out to these burger buns which are actually soft and thickly cut! Wish there was more vegetables (but it\'s understandable why they would have less - it\'s a burger joint not a salad bar) I also got these yummy spinach pops which were potato-spinach fried balls. Liked it, although yet again I wish there was more spinach. Altogether my order was close to 16/17 dollars - not the cheapest place to eat at, but I did order one of the more pricey burgers on the menu and I even ate dessert 🍫 
Fudgy vegan brownies! I\'m not a cakey brownie fan, so this was so perfect. Not an extremely crisp exterior but substantial, but the core of this is amazingly soft and chocolatey. Ate this really quickly and got a very bad sugar rush tho hahaha. Still totally worth it! Service here was fantastic as well, props to the male cashier who took my order, being friendly and nice and even specifically picking out the largest brownie for me! 
One of the best Vegan Burgers here. Love the interior deco. Monday is the best deal. 
And yes, I\'ve finally tried Vegan Burg. Love the shroomy burger &amp; seaweed fries! 🍟
Cream of shrooms, char-grilled satay, smokey bbq, vegan franks &amp; house of mushroom soup. 
Meat is always my preference but VeganBurg makes me think twice about that. A champion in the vegetarian movement with organic and GMO-free products, their 100% soy patty burger is not only delicious but also healthy. There wasn\'t a drop of oil that burst from the burger nor the fries. I felt like I ate clean after my meal. If I had the budget, I could eat this everyday, or at least every Meat-Free-Monday. 
Crispy potato-filled balls that\'s also stuffed with spinach makes for an addictive side, though all the fun stops after the sixth piece because that\'s all you are gonna get.
First time trying something apart from the Creamy Shrooms. Soy patty in between buns with lettuce, pineapple and teriyaki sauce in between. Burger was somewhat decent though the flour atop the bun can be too much for some, and the fibrous pineapple is a tad unchewable in certain parts. Patty seemed to have a bit of earthy mushroom flavours within, and teriyaki sauce seemed to be in-house; tasted a bit tangy with sweetness more than being savoury.
There\'s a few dishes that I have had that are hard to describe, and this is one of them. Apart from being crunchy enough, it\'s really hard to get convinced to pay for a tub of boiled broccoli that anyone can boil in water at home.
First time at veganburg. Pleasant experience.  Burger is presented on a mess tin.  Very innovative idea.  Creamy shroom burger is so yummy.  Lightly toasted ciabatta bread, sandwiched in between leaves of fresh lettuce and a good portion of vegan patty. True to its words, the creamy mushroom sauce is a velvety cream heaven.  And did i mention the seaweed fries has my name on it?
This has completely changed the way i see vegan meals 😱 these were sooo delicious and hearty!
Made from soya beans and mushrooms, the patties here do not contain gluten, dairy and eggs. Yes, you are skeptical. You probably think that sounds awful, but the Creamy Shrooms Burger ($7.90) at VeganBurg has successfully convinced many-a-carnivore that vegan burgers can be really, really good. With seaweed fries and spinach pops on the side, you\'re gonna leave with a full stomach and a guilt-free conscience. Also, it\'s Halal! Don\'t be selfish, carnivores, if your vegan friend wants a burger, show them some love and give this a try!
The fries were good! The patty tasted like mock duck meat. 
The spinach pops were a surprise, expected more spinach but still extremely filling. I tried their organic ice cream too, it was interesting. 
About 9 different burgers to choose from, all veggie burger but they try to make it taste like meat (for the patty). Halal friendly!
you could choose between fries and broccoli for sides and we decided to get both! the burger was surprisingly good but a little dry mm the \'meat\' patty was seasoned well! if you aren\'t vegan then this is something new and worth a try! 
cracked mayo burger with seaweed fries
old school corn mayo hotdog with seaweed fries
With patties made from 100% vegetable ingredients and the buns from wholemeal grains, you\'re ensured guilt-free fast food in the form of a delectable burger. Must-try items include the Hawaiian Teriyaki, Cracked Pepper Mayo and the Creamy Shrooms. End off your meal with their vegan dessert, moist and heavenly chocolate cake that is heavy on the lips but not on your hips!
1. I help save the earth &amp; its resources 2. I\'m gonna get a free lunchbox 3. It\'s VEGAN
Don\'t know why I keep rewarding myself for not studying
We used to think that plant based diet is impossible until VeganBurg is born. It proves that fast food is not junk food and its nutritious burgers can be as tasty as its meaty counterparts.
It\'s my first time eating vegan burger!
I tried their new trufflebello burger and it’s really pretty good together with the sweet potato fries:) they can work on their coolers drinks though cos tbh it’s just plain juice.-. Do something bout them maybe? For the price is not worth it for the set personally. But just for the burger it does taste better than normal burgers☺️✨🌿 #Burpple #burrplesg #foodiesg #foodgramsg #instafoodsg #foodblogsg #foodinsing #sgfood #wheretoeatsg #veganburgsg
The smoke felt a little extra. The drink tasted bland and watered down. Fortunately, the burger was the visit’s saving grace.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #foodstagram #instasg #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #singapore
Featuring charcoal buns that comes with a spooky face 👽, each set is served with frizzy fries (yay to twister curly fries 💖) and a witch’s kiwi brew (kiwi chiller 🥝🍸). Encased within the soft and fluffy charcoal buns lies a thick layer of panko crusted soy patty, fried to a crisp and well-breaded perfection with a “tender” minced soy filling. Along with fresh crisp lettuce, tomato, onion rings (raw) , the burger also comes with barbecue sauce (slathered beneath the lettuce) and mayonnaise (on top of the tomato) that added a tangy note and a creamy texture. Love the frizzy twister fries that’s crispy and addictive, if only there was more!! 😬 The witch’s kiwi brew was pretty mediocre, just the usual kiwi flavored chiller with a unique presentation in a cup adorned with raspberry syrup on its edge. Though the  raspberry syrup was kind of negligible here, given it’s mere presence that subsided within seconds 😢. Nevertheless, the kiwi brew is a mandatory refreshing chiller for the thriller! (PS: swipe to view the thriller - a feast for the sight before the sense! 🌬🌪 )\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Special thanks to @veganburg for the exclusive invitation to this newly launched limited edition burger! 💕 .\n<br />. .\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice #VBthriller

🌱 Guess seasoning and coating a #soy patty in batter and frying it helps! 😂 Anyway, it does feel pretty good to give the poor animals a break now and then... 😬\n<br />#dinner #healthy #food #yestergram #yummy #vegetarian #sgfood #foodsg #burpple #whati8
First time trying a vegan burger! Tried the Creamy Mushroom and Hawaiian (?) burger, the one with pineapples at the bottom haha. The portion of one burger is already too big for me, so I suggest going with friends that can eat your leftovers--. 
Needed something healthy for a change, @veganburg to the rescue! In all honesty, my experience with vegan food is mostly just average, i do like a few stalls at Fortune Centre, but vegan food often utilizes a lot of beans, and i do not like beans. I wasn\'t expecting much from this burger but it exceeded my expectations by a long mile! Had the \"Avocado Beetroot\" and \"Smoky BBQ\" burgers.
A must try is the creamy shrooms ($7.90) and the seasonal cranberry slaw burger ($9.90) that has a mushroom and brown rice patty instead of soya.
Hmmm.. Got to bite!!! 
走素食路線的漢堡餐廳🍴適合給自己一個好好做paperwork 的安靜處所，只是可惜沒有插座可以用！但餐點意外的不錯吃👍🏻Cracked Mayo Burg($10.80)一個餐點就可以讓妳沈浸在自己世界
Seasame rice burger with Japanese curry sandwiching the ever yummy soy pattie. Oiishi!
It\'s vegan!! Can be said more healthy junk food.
Crisp And Yummy.
The soy patty is crispy yet juicy with a mild spicy kick from the black pepper. The white button shrooms and sauce combi was divine, leaving a slightly tangy sensation.
Cracked Mayo Burger, peppery vegan patty with creamy mayo, it\'s as good as first time I tasted it.
Crispy and flavourful! Really enjoyed the burger. The steamed broccoli with no salt though, not so much. Should have  opted for the unhealthier fries 😁
Very decent veggie burger! Will be back for more!
This is definitely not junk food.\n<br />Soya Cappuccino, crispy potato spinach pops and broccoli.\n<br />Coffee, failed. Not much of coffee taste. I enjoyed the pops in my mouth 👄, they were still crunchy after an hour.\n<br />I love the garden concept restaurant.\n<br />Tables are made from recycled pellet, turf top bench that delivers the nature to my ass (but not pricky) and the place is spacious. Prices are reasonable. Burgers range from $5.90-$7.90. $11.80 for the meal. Teas cost around $3.90 &amp; soya cappuccino at $4.90. A Very nice place to chill. They have 3 outlets in Singapore (Here, MBFC &amp; The Grandstand) \n<br />#veganburg #jalaneuros #vegan #burger #sgfoodie #singapore #vscofood #vsco #igsg #sgeats #foodpict #foodphotography #foodpornsg #bike #bistro #cappuccino #American #westernfood #western #burpple
