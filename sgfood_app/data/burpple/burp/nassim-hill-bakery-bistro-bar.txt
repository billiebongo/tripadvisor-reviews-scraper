Apparently the truffle flavour seemed to be more distinct here as compared to the mac &amp; cheese, flavourful and aromatic.\n<br />The mushrooms were chewy, juicy and lended a pleasant earthy note to the risotto that was creamy, thick while retaining a grainy mouthfeel. Topped with Parma ham chips that added a pleasant crisp factor and a tinge of savoury saltiness, the only gripe would be the steep pricetag that came along. But much thanks to @burpple for the giveaway, I managed to enjoy my meal here without any worries to the damage in my pocket ‚ò∫Ô∏è. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
With an approximate waiting time of 20-30 minute, the top layer of cheese was baked to perfection with golden brown exterior that was thick, gooey and crusty at the edges. A pity the elasticity wasn\'t that on point though, with the cheese being a little dry and as a result, not so flexible üòÖ. Truffle flavour and aroma was distinct but I would personally prefer it to be stronger. The macaroni are bathed in a creamy bechamel sauce that\'s flavourful with a subtle truffle aroma. Pasta was al dente but some parts (especially the bottom) were a tad too dry and undercooked. Overall, it\'s a dish that\'s flavourful and enjoyable (especially if you are a fan of cheese) but highly recommended for sharing. Would also prefer if there were some ingredients e.g. Mushrooms, bacon or ham to go along too instead of just plainly macaroni &amp; cheese. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
Finally one of the better ones I\'ve tried! This is just the half portion. #burpple
Kinda disappointed with this dessert - a bed of warm pear compote, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cheddar crumble. The ice cream was of good quality but we definitely wished the pear compote came with a much softer texture rather than how it was too crisp a crunch, clashing with the crumble. The cubes of pears could also be more evenly warmed and we would have probably liked a stronger tasting crumble, to bring the elements all together better. Maybe we should have gone for the Apple Crumble Cake!
Instead of toppings on the waffles, Nassim mixes in bits of bacon and cheddar cheese into their waffle batter before it goes on to the griddle! We enjoyed the crispy chewy texture and the savouriness you get in between bites. The side bacon strips were done well, sweet and savoury - definitely no complaints about too much bacon here! It might get a bit jelak if you‚Äôre planning to finish this yourself, but the chive sour cream did help with that. If not, get another dish and share it with a friend! Prices are quite steep here though.
I\'ve never had this and Bone Marrow for $12? Of course we got this. Fatty and creamy, while it was bland on its own, pairing it with the buttered toasted baguette, delightfully crisp in contrast with the marrow was pretty tasty. Served with salt, parsley and shallots on the side for taste. 
Happy Sunday.\n<br />Hearty Scrambled Egg with Salami ($20) and Country Scrambled Eggs with Honey Baked Ham ($18)
The menu here is extensive! A huge variety of options to choose from, you might be at a loss (if you\'re like me). Nassim Hill was super crowded on a Sunday for lunch; the noise in an enclosed space made it a little difficult to talk if you\'re looking for a quiet place to catch up with a friend. 
the meat:bread ratio in this sandwich is not great but it ended up a satisfying meal. was hoping for a katz\'s deli kind of sandwich but i guess that kind of food only exists in america. \n<br />nevertheless the mix of corned beef, emmenthal, sauerkraut and reuben dressing was at once savoury, creamy and tart. \n<br />the guinness stout bread was fantastic, though - toothsome crust with a nice, moist crumb. \n<br />went in at 3pm and the place was nearly empty. it\'s a good thing lunch lasts til 4; schedules can be busy at times.
The ragu had a meaty stench from poor seasoning? Not recommended.
The double decker burger sounded good on paper but failed the impress. The seasoning of the patty seemed a little off. However the fries were done well.
Finally decided to visit nassim hill after reading reviews/looking at so many pictures and viewing the menu so many times hehe plus got entertainer 1-1 so even greater perks beside the tasty looking food!!!! Was q bummed that the main menu item offer did not apply to salads but I was determined to still order the Asian BBQ Chicken salad ($15). Was rather impressed by the juicy meat and flavorful BBQ rub on the chicken breast, the freshness of the cucumbers, red peppers and carrots as well as the crunchiness from the sliced almonds, edamame and golden wanton skins. That was q a lengthy description wasn\'t it, but all these individual elements that laid on a bed of greens was complimented well by the soy ginger dressing that (thumbs up to the cafe) was placed on the side. I don\'t like saucy salads so I was glad when I had the choice of how much dressing I wanted to add and boy, it was good. I will definitely come back here to try the sandwiches or even the breakfast menu on my not-so-detox day üòõüòõüòõ
From coffee, food, staff to interior, vibes ... everything we experienced here today constitutes a perfect brunch ‚ú®üåüüéÑ\n<br />We will be back!
An Asian-twist with one of my favourite Singapore dishes: Chilli Crab. I can\'t even. Garnished with chilli padi, this pasta is pretty spicy. The sauce was authentically local, with a good amount of beaten egg mixed in it. The best part is that the chilli-egg sauce drenches the spaghetti so that with every mouthful of pasta you get enough sauce (For some pastas, you run out of sauce midway through and that\'s annoying). Comes in half ($16) and full ($25) portions. This bistro is slightly off the main town area and is located in the quieter Tanglin area. Their brunch, lunch and dessert menu is incredibly extensive so you\'ll definitely be spoilt for choices. üôåüèªüòõ
Looked and smelt better than it taste. The crust was decent, but the macaroni inside was hard and tasteless, and the cheese too processed tasting. Could barely finish it. Sorely disappointed after seeing the rave reviews about this from other Burpplers.
I may have to ask for the full size (SGD 25+) next time. But can I Âä†Êñô‰∏çÂä†Èù¢ (add on ingredients only and not the pasta)?\n<br />ü¶Ä\n<br />The sauce was as they described, spicy (very very spicy) and tangy! But what brought the sauce to new level was the smooth and perfectly cooked slightly runny egg whites. Pasta was al dente as it should be. A really awesome plate of chilli crab pasta for spicy lovers. Fans of the sweeter version of chilli crab sauce may not like this though.\n<br />ü¶Ä\n<br />#freewifisg\n<br />ü¶Ä\n<br />Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar\n<br />56 Tanglin Road\n<br />Tanglin Post Office 01-03\n<br />(Take the stairs beside Momor to enter Swiss Butchery.

It is very good. The chef is flexible to change sunny side up to scramble egg.
Brunch on a PH morning...
Large hunks of beef bone, with incredibly decadent, fatty, creamy marrow. Pair with sweet caramelised onions and crisp buttered baguette!
Crisp shoestring fries coated in generous gooey mozzarella cheese and savoury minced beef, in a beef au jus and wine gravy!
loved it that there were an option for half size mains.\n<br />chilli crab pasta and double decker burger.
Delicious Dark Chocolate Bread from @nassimhillbakery texture of this bread closer to a pound cake but with a touch more on the fluffy side. The consistency throughout is perfect and there was a good balance between richness of the dark chocolate and how sweet it was. The perfect afternoon tea snack! 4/5
Makes you feel a little less guilty üòÅ here, it\'s light and well cut. Love how it\'s not that oily. #burpple #burpplesg #sgcafe
The Nassim Hill has certainly perfected the true blue Mac &amp; Cheese, golden crusty on the outside; creamy and rich on the inside. The macaroni are carb rich but the satisfaction of each mouthful of awesome al dente and savoury are just too much for you to say no. 
My fav dish from the dinner-  sweet potato fries!!! Soooo nicely fried üòã 
Since it was quite costly, my group of 4 people decided to share our breakfast. To be honest, it was satisfying for all of us. I recommend both!! :-) We payed around SGD66 for these 2 dishes and each of us had a drink (my latte was $6). Fast service. Would come again (with a group of people still haha)
Ok, the brownie is hidden under the generous scoop of ice cream
This is truly worthy of all the calories. You can taste the richness of the egg batter, the fluffy bread and light Chantilly cream. Not just some silly oily sweet dough....Gently, gently, gently (chomping down the toast)... Life is but a dream...
When sliced through , generous filling of crab meat was found . When you paired it with flowing egg yolk, you just can\'t put down your utensils . However the price isn\'t wallet- friendly without the 1 for 1 offer when you pay with ur posb /dbs card . Hence bring a friend with you to spilt the cost 
A little off the way, but turns out to be a good hangout place for he night. Happy hour drinks and delectable varieties of selections. For instance, this chilli crab pasta filled with spicy and tangy sauce with generous lumps of crab meat. Tantalizing and savory plate of delish! 
Entertainer one for one. Yum! Most mains around 23 to 25 bucks.
Not the most photogenic plating but I swear to God that this is one of the best flavor packed savoury waffles I ever had!
Spicy? Yes, if you eat those chilies!\n<br />The eggs are done nicely, oozing yolks with hollandaise. Instead of the usual topping of bacon or salmon, it\'s sausages. What\'s more attractive? JALAPE√ëO GUACAMOLE! The toast has thin spread of jalape√±o guacamole, maybe can spread a bit more? Overall was great, portion is huge and very worth the price tag. 
Quite a walk from down but I love how the remote location means a quiet dinning experience. Chilli Crab Pasta ($25) has a slight kick of spiciness, Croquettes ($14) was forgettable, Cheddar Cheese Bacon Waffles ($19)  was pretty decent but I still prefer it with ice cream. Lastly, Truffles Fries ($12) was the usual typical taste.  
@justinwjtan always orders a mac &amp; cheese at every restaurant to benchmark their skill at making pasta. Just like why I usually order an aglio olio. üòõüçù\n<br />The cheese wasn\'t too thick and didn\'t turn him off. I guess that\'s a good thing? Lol! \n<br />Overall a simple dish that satisfied him well. üëç \n<br />#burpple #pasta #mac #cheese #dinner
At $22++, this restaurant belongs to the pricier end. However, it is a good place for dates with the quiet dim ambience throughout. Even has a bar and a parking lot right outside.\n<br />The bread were too crispy, shattering upon prodding with a fork. \n<br />Steak wasn\'t the best I\'ve tasted, but it\'s still good. It was a little overdone from medium though. \n<br />#burpple #ribeye #steak
Crispy bacon strips (the brininess of the cured meat is just too alluring and that crunch when you bite into each slice...#flawless) served with cheddar waffles with, what do you know, more bacon bits! Fluffy yet crisp, it can get a little too cloying but what does it matter because when you sin, you don\'t sin halfway. Then there\'s more scrambled eggs which unfortunately is just like Katherine Heigl in 27 Dresses ‚Äì the ever supportive bridesmaid but never the bride...until we run out of bacons and waffles. Ok, that\'s all.
Loved this dessert! The moist, soft texture of the cake is generously studded with walnuts, pineapple, raisins. \n<br />The combination of sweet and fruity, crunchy and soft is beautiful. Cream cheese frosting slightly meh, but overall still a very good slice of cake.
This thin, crisp, savoury dish is good because cheese + bacon + waffle = good.
And it feels just like fluffy scrambled eggs. The salad is there as a gentle reminder that tomorrow is Monday. Ok, that\'s all.
There\'s a good size able chunks of crab meat inside with lots of sauce!!! It\'s so spicy that I cannot deal. üòÇüòÇ managed to finish everything with lots of difficulty. Lol
Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar has a very good modern rendition of a local favourite, Chili Crab Pasta!
This unique beer infused bread has an earthy, slightly nutty, malty taste. Crisp and soft, I find spreading butter over it helps bring out the beer aroma. Good!
Super delicious cheddar cheese and bacon waffles paired with sour cream. 
This isn\'t the typical fluffy waffles but there is something incredibly comforting in its slightly chewy texture and slight sweet batter, almost reminiscent of the neighbourhood bakery waffles only this is savoury and upsized. Reservations recommended.
The Belgian waffles was made to the perfect amount of crisp, and went well with maple syrup and unsalted butter! Also loved the smiley savory touch added by the beerbeiser sausage!
Located at tanglin post office at the edge of town, this is a lovely place for both brunches and dinners. While the highly raved about chili crab pasta is indeed very yummy, the sauce itself is actually slightly different than a real chili crab sauce. This one borders more on the tangy flavor.  Other food ordered was fish and chips, grilled Seabass, seafood aglio olio. This is promising place and I would return to try out their brunch menu.
Runny poached eggs with creamy Hollandaise sauce, atop smoked ham and white ciabatta buns, complete with side salad and a small bread basket, all for just $19. Add $6 for a hearty serving of smoked salmon, and you\'re all set for the rest of the day. Nassim hill is located just off tanglin and hidden in a quiet corner, with convenient parking availability an almost certainty. But what I like best about this place.. They open at 8am and happy hours start right when the doors are open!
Pretty unique cake which is a cross between a cake like texture with a soft pie crust. Wanted to try the carrot cake as well but that was sold out.
A half portion at Nassim Hill costs $16 and a full one as featured here costs $25. I like that the spiciness was not in your face but it subtly kicked in a while later. The chicken was well marinated and tender. The chilli crab pasta is another signature of theirs.
Looking like a plumped up pillow, the lighter egg parts of the omelette were anchored by the rich gooey-ness of the mozzarella cheese, and perked up with little pieces of fresh tomatoes. From what I tasted, it seemed like the chef had decided to leave the seasoning to the customer as the omelette was on the bland side. I don\'t think that\'s a bad idea actually. 
Unlike most scrambled eggs I have seen that tend to be a uniform looking creamy yellow, this one still retained some separation between the yolk and albumen. Although it tasted fine, it wasn\'t exceptional. I have also come to realise that the food at Nassim Hill Bakery tends to fall on the bland side. Luckily I had the crispy strips of bacon to stop my tastebuds from getting bored. If you aren\'t into bacon, fear not, there\'s always the beerbeiser sausage or honey baked ham to keep your eggs company while bringing on some salty action.
Dedicating my 100th post (on IG) to my Indian BFF, @rev_mano, for giving me this wonderful birthday brunch treat 2 weeks ago. Besides filling each other in on our lives, I\'m giving 4 munchies to the al dente pasta with generous chunks of succulent crab meat in fiery, tangy chilli crab sauce. I couldn\'t have asked for more when I was enjoying this dish with an even more awesome company.
Patty a tad soft but relatively flavourful from the herbs. Bun could do with time on the grill.
It\'s a shame to say that I have never been to Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar since its inception in 2012, and it would be criminal not to visit them. I tried their signature Cheddar Cheese Waffle with bits of bacon and cheese filling served with sour cream and bacon strips.
Gorgonzola, mozzarella, shaved Parmesan, arugula and truffle oil with an add-on of fresh prawns - 3/5 
Weekend brunch serve: sirloin Steak beneath the Sunny side up with entrec√¥te homemade sauce. I manage to finish all n I think is really not bad. Hehe 
Two sunny side up eggs that served with red Harissa ragout. Worth the try. 
Kind of over-ordered for two girls but it was worth it üòã
Sweet , mildly spicy  great as a dip come try come one come all 
Mastering the perfect balance between chic and casual, you can be sure Nassim Hill has got it right. They have managed to incorporate a wide range of savoury delights in their menu to cater for every craving from breakfast to dinner. It was really worth the money the last time we went, especially with the 1-for-1 offer for mains. Our fav picks were the French bouchot mussels ($25), poutine fries and the chili crab pasta ($16, small portion). Yummmyyyyyy. 
I liked the contrast of textures! Generous serving of yogurt as well 
Come for the putin leave with a grin and an extra belly ring but who cares? 
Poached eggs, jalape√±os guacamole, Spanish chorizo, hollandaise sauce on white ciabatta.
Hand model is back to work! üòè 1 for 1 mains with the entertainer app, bill for 2 mains came up to about $26 üôå #burpple
We had skillet eggs and eggs and steak, along with latte and bread service. Given that nassim hill baked their own bread, the bread given were assorted, mildly savoury and sweet, texture was really good. For the skillet eggs, good for sharing as portion was generous. Spicy, spiced and tangy-licious! Latte from liberty maintained it\'s usual standards.
Skillet Eggs with Chorizo and Steak and Eggs accompanied by Bread Basket and Latte from Liberty. Skillet eggs is rich and you can taste the spices in it. Portion is big enough for sharing. Steak and eggs is decent for its price though I wish for the steak to be thicker. The bread basket is a good accompaniment.  
üóªSandwiches, pasta &amp; some awesomez sweet potato fries~~ okie I love this place already üòç #jmeats
Almond brioche french toast with caramelized bananas and rum, toasted pecans, whipped mascarpone cheese | Festive menu is up! 
Pear Cheddar Crumble that was really delicious. Loved the sharp zing from the crunchy crumble made with mature cheddar, and the soft (not mushy) pear compote.
Here\'s their signature Hot Reuben - a hearty butty of corned beef, melted Emmental cheese, sauerkraut, onions, Russian dressing. Fresh, vibrant flavours assaulted the senses till all of it was gone. The homebaked Asahi Kuronama beer #bread deserves special mention for its depth of malty &amp; smoky flavours.\n
You\'re all I can think about since brunch last wk. Mr Super Hot Reuben.
Granola quinoa berries parfait. Real pretty I must say!
Almond brioche french toast with a double shot flat white. My world is complete.
Yes, 5km never seemed so long. My thoughts: 1km mark \"What? Only 1km?\", 2km mark \"Not even half?\", 3km \"I\'m dying already\", 4km \"I can\'t even see the finishing line\" and 5km \"This is the last time I\'m running\". Anyway thanks @hungrybaker for pushing me all the way!
Tried quite a number of items on the menu and I must say the spicy Huevos Benedict remains one of my favourite!
It was filled with laughter , feasting and catching up with some of my foodie friends ! I\'m blessed to have like minded pals around me :) this is the first of two cakes I received over the weekend! It was a loaf of chocolate cake from Nassim hill cafe :) truly chocolatey and very moist ! These are the only slices left Heehe my parents in law enjoyed these a lot too :) thanks dear @sibehpuikia for blessing us with the goodies !!
huge serving, huge flavour. nice place to chill out on a weekend afternoon

Part of the celebratory menu rolled out in conjunction with this year\'s Easter Weekend is this Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs, Ham and Hollandaise sauce ($21++). What a cheerfully bright dish it is thanks to the vibrant hues of the different types of sweet potatoes used. And it tastes good too.
This was a smallish but quite nicely-done omelette. What I liked was that they were quite generous with the smoked salmon both inside and out. There were cubes of cream cheese in there as well but I found only a few clustered in the middle of my omelette. Could do with more to enhance the whole taste experience. The salad was lovely - fresh leaves that came drizzled with a light lemon &amp; olive oil dressing.
Tucked away little hideout at the Tanglin Post Office, love the location. Small menu of food and drinks but pretty decent. Enjoyed their bread basket that came with the Salmon &amp; cheese omelette.
Crispy multigrain waffles that are sooooo good!! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with an immense depth of flavor!
What happens when I have brunch: Want to try eggs benedict, but always seduced by waffles.
Steak &amp; eggs S$22\n<br />150gram US angus prime sirloin steak topped with 2 sunny-side up, served with homemade entrec√¥te sauce. (All mains comes with bread &amp; side salad) Salad is so good that he finished all, steak is good too! üòã
Yes again. Revisited because we wanted to try their steak too (pic later!) Eggs Benedict S$20
Super awesome bread yesterday for brunch! Every set of brunch/breakfast u ordered, they will serve bread. But mine was served after I finished my main course üò®, for some others, the bread was served first. \n<br />Well anyway, the bread is really good, soft, fresh &amp; QQ  and we finished it all! (Bread from Freshly Baked by Le Bijoux)
Took me about 5 minutes to figure out where exactly it is, but it\'s a nice hidden coffee and brunch place when you to the back of the post office.
So full from 3 mains! But still..anyone say Jaffa cake? üòÅ
And of course the star of the day! Best in Sg babyy üòç

‚ÄòNuff said ‚ò∫Ô∏è Chilli Crab Pasta - S$17++ (Half) / S$25(Full)\n<br />üìç: @nassimhillbakery Singapore
One thing most chilli crab pastas lack is spicy but this fellow here sure packs a punch. As you dig into the pasta, you‚Äôll find many little chilli padi bits which explains the heat. I also liked that the pasta isn‚Äôt overly sweet, a common mistake by most places. Just wish for the pasta to be slightly more al dente. Otherwise, all good.
Wow, It‚Äôs so different from normal waffles as the cheddar cheese and bacons bits were cooked together in the waffles! Served with bacon on the side and sour cream! Waffles are fragrant with a bit of rusty burnt edges and yet not too burnt!  @nassimhillbakery #nassimhillbakery #nassimhillbistro #nassimhillbakerybistrobar #cheddarcheesebaconwaffles
Spaghetti super yummy and well texture, not too soft nor too hard, well timed! Love the chilli crab sauce, Super flavourful and not too spicy! Not forgetting the generous portion of crab meat in it!

I\'m only back here because I have a voucher to spend (thanks Burpple &amp; Amanda!). Didn\'t enjoy my previous experience here because the brunch food was so filled with MSG &amp; the service was bad. It\'s not that the waitstaff aren\'t friendly - they are. But they were just so disorganised &amp; it was difficult to get their attention.

‚òù Hope everyone\'s having a good Sunday brunch!
With all the rave reviews this has garnered, today\'s experience was really just a -wet- blanket. The chilli crab sauce was so watered down that I felt like I was drinking soup. Nope. Not even sauce because it didn\'t hold its own I had to use a spoon for this. The generous lumps of crabmeat? While there were the aforementioned chunks of meat, there were also chunks of garlic that left me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. None of the sweetness of seafood, a little heat from the odd pieces of chilli padi tossed into the sauce and a general absence of a savoury satisfaction from a carb dish. Calories could\'ve been better gained on fries or a pizza order :( #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #sgfoodie #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehopping #burpple #nassimhillbakery #onthetable #instafood #igsg #omysg #opensnap #burpple
yes, this Pear Cheddar Crumble with the soft-baked fresh pears, crispy pieces of cheddar and Gelato, enthralling in flavour and textures overall - do check out my review (link in bio)
well, actually I was swirling -with joy - after eating this Chilli Crab Pasta, robust and rich in flavour and springy strands of noodles... you should try it. Check out my review (link in bio)
./ c h e d d a r . p e a r . c r u m b l e /. A divine warm bowl of caramelized pear cubes buried underneath a sweet deluge of creme anglaise, followed by a landslide of savoury sweet cheddar shortbread crumble and a scoop of vanilla bean tainted ice cream. \n<br />An excellent salty-sweet combination of a dessert. One can\'t ask for more ÔΩÖÔΩòÔΩÉÔΩÖÔΩêÔΩî a better cook on the pear cubes that would have rendered them softer and better fit with the crunch in the bowl„ÄÇ
Nassim Hill\'s {Cheddar Cheese Bacon Waffles} with bacon strips pressed into the batter before the griddle is pressed shut equating to thin, earth-shattering bits of savory goodness strewned throughout the light fluffy innards house within crispy brown walls„ÄÇ
is kicking back with one of these... letting every drop connect with the senses, and every sip make things right... #instasg #instadrinks #dotd #mojito #cocktail #thearcticstar #onthetable #nassimhillbakery #igsg #sgig #igers #burrple #instagood #instagram #instagrammers

And I must say that I love the Kale Caesar (SGD$15.00), crisps of the kale sprigs and paper-thin bacon slices, tasting utterly good too. I would go on a green diet for this. \n<br />#foodie #sgfood #foodsg #foodblog #sgblog #foodblogger #onthetable #nomnom #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #eatbooksg #kalecaesar #salad #healthy #openricesg #whati8today #foodstagram #burrple #foodforfoodie #foodporn #foodgram #foodgasm #foodspotting #fotd #thearcticstar #instafood #nassimhillbakety #igers #instadaily #instasg
Pity about the coffee though #cafehopping #sgfood #sgfoodies #cheatmeal #bacon #burpple
Good effort for trying. Needs cheese curd and tastier gravy to be more authentic. Good for sharing nonetheless ! Must order at this joint.
Very filling and satisfying sandwich, and combination not too common here.
The boyfriend enjoyed the burger!
üòç This {Mac and Cheese} just nailed it man. So much cheese and just the right portion to make me feel more than satisfied! üòÅüòÅ

Potato Rosti and Grilled Pork Chop. Valentine day dinner set  S$99 for 2 pax.  Surprisingly the pork chop is very tender. But it seem to a bit bland imo.

The waffle was crispy and the ice cream was shiok! $18 we\'ll spent! I also tried the apple crumble and it was also delicious. It was priced at $8 per slice! 
This egg Benny reminded. Me of the one served at the now closed Cafe Hacienda.
