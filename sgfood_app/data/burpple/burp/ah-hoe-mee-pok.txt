What\'s so special about this place is that it\'s owned and run by a Japanese family - the daughter and mom takes orders, while father and son prepares the food. Because of this, expect this bowl of BCM to be different from your standard hawker fare.
Also wouldn\'t recommend the Dumpling Soup ($4) because the dumplings are extremely salty. The soup has preserved vegetables in it, which alters the taste of the soup - so it isn\'t as shiok as the original/regular BCM soup.
Haven\'t had this for the longest time due to the irregular opening hours. But i have to say the texture is really bad this time round, its no different from buying meepok from just a normal food court in any of the shopping centres. 
Arigato.
That satisfying one. So we went......
Got to queue a bit lah...
A generous amount of pork balls, minced meat, canned abalone slices ,Charshu and loads of crispy pork lard. The al dente Mee Pok with the savoury Shoyu sauce was an interesting mix. The generous serving and taste of the noodles justifies the price! If you\'re not an adventurous person, the traditional Mee Pok is available too.\n<br />Priced at {$6}// .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood#sgfood#sgeats#foodporn#makansg#meepok#ahhoemeepok#japanesemeepok#yummy#delicious#burpple#sgig#foodstagram#food#foodie#instagood#instahappy#foodislife#foodexplore#instafood_sg

The Legendary Ah Hoe Mee Pok. That Ba Chor Mee made by a Japanese family. This is the $5.00 bowl.

didnt know this famous \"jap\" bak chor mee stall so near my new work place! Really not bad especially the mushrooms! But i prefer the noodle to be slightly softer... ($4) went to the son\'s stall instead at Blk 713 #bakchormee #bcm #hawker #hawkerpedia #dinner #ahhoemeepok #clementi #clementiwest #japanesebakchormee #throwback #latergram #foodsg #food #sgfoodie #sgfood #igsg #igdaily #burpple #burpplesg #foodporn
The best one i ever had
Was around the area running some errands &amp; didn\'t expect this place to be so popular. Not knowing that they\'re owned by Japanese, yours truly was given the blur-est look when ordering in HokkienðŸ˜¬
Well, I gotta say it is quite good the meepok is very nicely cooked &amp; have that good chewy texture also the ingredients are not overly cooked plus the sauces goes very well with the noodle. The plain soup given, tasted good too with a nice sweetness to it. I know there aren\'t much MSG used cause I don\'t feel thirsty after drinking it. Overall worth a queue but not that 1 hr queue, maybe a 30 mins queue will be more worth it.  But to be fair, it is a good bowl of meepok!
Prepared by a Japanese!  #burpple #6plus #food #foodporn #yum #instafood #TagsForLikes #yummy #amazing #instagood #photooftheday #sweet #dinner #lunch #breakfast #fresh #tasty #foodie #delish #delicious #eating #foodpic #foodpics #eat #hungry #foodgasm #hot #foods
Different texture from your usual mee pok, more springy. Slight queue at 10am, should be utter madness at lunch time. #igsg #igers #igfood #instafood #instadaily #instafollow #food #foodie #foodsg #foodpic #foodgasm #foodporn #foodstagram #sgig #sgfoodie #singapore #singaporefood #foodblogging #foodblogger #sgfood #sgfoodie #instalater #latergram #burpple #setheats
The one handling the food appears to be a Japanese this time from their neighboring stall. Taste wise not as strong as before  #sgeats #followme #foodblogger #singaporefood #delicious #yummy #foodgasm #foodstamping #sgfood #foodoftheday #foodporn #burpple #foodspotting #fatdieme #foodgasm #instafood #openricesg #justeat #foodphotography #8dayseatout #instasg #umakemehungry #lifeisdeliciousinsg #foodblogs #nomnomnom #nofilter
