Delicious pork belly serves as appetizer that ushers you to an array of Southern delicacies themed on their famous fried chicken. Be spoilt with a long list of bourbon whiskey lining up the bar bustling with live music on Friday and loyal patrons.
The waffle was totally different than the usual ice cream waffles; very light and airy, very crisp with not much of a buttermilk taste. The fried chicken was good too. I love that its savoury batter was well seasoned, with an almost umami flavour. The bourbon maple syrup was definitely an acquired taste as I am not an experienced drinker, but I do think it paired better with this dish than a regular maple syrup would. Bottomline: try it!
I was indeed still in a hangover state from the early morning\'s race, and this hearty lunch was just what I needed to replenish and repair my poor body üòÇ. The biscuits were a tad dry, and reminded me of scones. The beef patty was great though, very juicy and I believed was drenched in gravy (biscuits and gravy!). Such a sinful but delicious meal.

Love the pecan pie here! This isn\'t a common dessert and I love how this makes a wonderful dessert after all the heavy food served here.
Love my savoury waffles. This one came with beans, pulled pork and a pretty sunny side up. #BurppleXChope
Not bad! Esp the syrupüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª \n<br />Do take note that the waffle is the fully crispy kind (and it\'s yummy!)\n<br />But I still prefer Sin Lee Food\'s version üòÅ\n<br />SGD 20++ plus $2++ for sides
Ordered medium done for the steak but came well-done and rather hard.\n<br />Side of poached eggs, truffle fries and garden salad were not bad! üòÅ\n<br />SGD 22++
A nice place for small groups. We ordered massive amount of food, considering that we were only 3 girls. 1 bacon mac &amp; cheese (S$12) , 1chilli cheese fries (S$ 15), 1 chicken &amp; waffles (S$ 20), 1 blackened pork collar (S$ 24), 4 glasses of Gran Hacienda Savignon (S$ 32) and 4 glasses of Jim Beam White (S$ 32). We used the #entertainerapp 1 for 1 free main dish. Total bill inclusive svc and gst was S$126.20 Verdict: The food was decent but the chilli cheese fries and the blacked pork collar was the bomb! This bar is located in between lavender mrt and bugis mrt; and it was about 10mins walk from the mrt stations. They have limited indoor seats and if you intend to come in a group, it is best to make reservation. We made ours using #chope .  #burpplesg #burpple #bugismrt #lavendermrt
The usual buns have been replaced by DEEP FRIED MAC &amp; CHEESE PATTIES (!!), moist, stretchy and cheesy.  Of course the usual components are still there - cheese, tomatoes, moist beef patties and lettuce üçî, served with sweet potato fries!! Now, that\'s a perfect Fri-yay food representative!!
Much. Food. Not a bad place to go if one craves southern food but that usually isn\'t my go-to cuisine. But I guess fried food lovers may want to consider giving their chicken and waffles a try. Portions are filling, if anything. Wallet helped by entertainer app.\n<br />#sgrestaurant #sgfood #sgfoodie #southernfood #burpple
I still prefer my waffles sweet. That Mac &amp;a Cheese burger at the back was pretty cool though! #burpple #foodporn #foodspotting
Anyway, had the Chicken &amp; Waffles $20 and Blackened Pork Collar $24. The pork collar was tender and goes really well w the thyme and garlic cream sauce. üëçüèº
Impressed by their chicken waffles, this time I\'d ordered their 3P Burger($24). It is amazig how much meat they can squeeze into this burger. There is the 3 P\'s (Pulled Pork, Pork Belly, Candied Bacon), red cabbage slaw, apple sauce, jalape√±o aioli and fried onions. There\'s so much in between the 2 buns that I had a hard time devouring it, not that I\'m complaining though üòù . Definitely my new favourite in this place. üòã
2nd time having this. The Beast\'s Chicken &amp; Waffles, a must order whenever you\'re here. Juicy chicken thigh after a 24 hour brine, crispy light waffles with bourbon maple butter sauce. Oh did I mention there is going to be a 3rd visit. üôä
Very different from the Canadian style Poutine. But tasty nonetheless and topped with a fried egg. 
Perfect char, super tasty and best of all it comes specked with bacon pieces over mash. Delicious to the last bite
Super yummy (and unhealthy) food. This blackened pork was nicely charred, although the portion is quite small, could have done with a little more of the mash potato. 
$20, may not look like much but this was pretty shiok. Quite liked the dip on the side which was tasty but subtle enough to not steal the show from this very crispy, tender and juicy chicken. Portion wasn\'t filling though, thank goodness for The Entertainer 1-for-1 üòÑ
.\n<br /> Love their crispy buttery waffles. The chicken batter was crispy and the chicken was tender. Unfortunately, it was too greasy cos they use chicken thigh instead of breast. Back here for this? Perhaps not...
I wasn\'t impressed the first time i had it! But i am glad that i gave it a 2nd shot! The fried chicken was really juicy! I guess i will be back soon! 
Time to unleash the beast in me as I feast on this yummy Chicken &amp; Waffles. The chicken was succulent and crispy, and the waffles were simply so fluffy and delicious. Drizzled with bourbon maple butter sauce, this was such a great weekend dinner treat!
[The Beast] Where can you find the best Chicken and Waffles in Singapore? If you ask me, my answer will definitely be The Beast.
Reunited and it feels so goodddddd. Poutine is such a sinful treat yet is so worth every damn calorie. I had my first and last poutine over at Canada, where the fries were drenched in meat sauce and cheese, making it a deliriously delish treat for us all. The version at the beast also came atop with a sunny side-up, which went so well with the meat sauce. It\'s portion makes it great for sharing!
So-called one of the specialties of the house, I was immediately skeptical because of the lackluster presentation. However, the flavours that came out of this dish was really full; I liked the intensity of the meat. Although the pork could have been a little less hard, it was still reasonably tender. The sauce though was sublime, and was probably what made the dish good. Portion wise this is really too small to call this a meal and you would probably need to get some appetizers or just get yourself a chicken n waffles :p
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Caf√© Hopping
The standard here improved since the last time I came. The southern fried chicken thigh was so juicy and crispy at the same time. The waffles were intentionally done more airy so as to complement and not overwhelm the taste of the chicken, serving up more like a biscuit than a waffle for ice cream. The bourbon maple sauce was the cherry on top through the infusion of sweet and salty flavors in one bite. A little pricey but compared to other cafes which sell this dish, it\'s actually below average. Anyhow the price was alleviated by the Entertainer voucher that I had üòã
The Mac and cheese \'bun\' was deep fried with a great crispy crackling sound with each bite. The Mac and cheese was moist with a slightly muted cheese flavor. \n<br />The patty done pink and tender, was slathered in bacon jam and BBQ sauce. Worked really well with the bun. Although the meat needs a little more seasoning. \n<br />It\'s a novel idea, though it still needs a little tuning to get right.\n<br />Monster was starving yesterday now he\'s full. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
This creative combination can easily satisfy more than 2 people. #burpple #8DAYSEat #ketohloh
7 humans, 1 burger to rule them all. *heavy breathing*
We first shared some side dishes (in order of preference)- buffalo wings, Southern poutine, pimento cheese dip and mozzarella sticks. Had the famed dish as well as the pork collar, and I must say I actually preferred the latter which tasted better. The chicken cutlet was really crispy but didn\'t have much taste other than oil, flour and the syrup drizzled over. Waffle was crisp and light, good on its own. Couldn\'t get enough of candied bacon so we had this bacon waffle sundae. Drinkswise I ordered Country Old Fashioned which had a lot of Bourbon in it, too strong for my liking. Generally preferred the sides to the mains! #Burpple
This ain\'t too bad. About 2 bite size for me. I could eat a \"Carl\'s Junior\" sized one if they ever make one. Tummy says worth trying!
the yeasty crispy waffle with that texas fried chicken. you drizzle down that home made maple mix.
This had buttermilk biscuits, sausage gravy, hash brown, poached eggs. It was a good combination but very very heavy and could have done with something to cut the greasiness of it. The biscuits were good because they were buttery and flaky. Eggs were done well but overall I think there are better options on the menu, for the amount of money. Cost: $18
A really generous portion; not for those looking for a light meal. The biscuits were really well made, though it\'s too heavy and a bit hard to stomach two of them. The gravy was quite tasty, and made the whole dish a lot more palatable. The fried chicken was juicy and tender, but nothing spectacular. Was really disappointed by the salad; it had a slimy texture and didn\'t seem fresh. There was way too much vinaigrette and it was a bad start to the dish. Worth the price for the quantity, but overall quality was lacking somewhat. Priced at $22
The bread was served warm which always leaves a good impression. The small knob of butter does nothing to the dish, but it\'s ok because the bread itself is delicious. It\'s baked slightly crispy on the outside, but still soft and crumbly inside. It\'s not too sweet but still has lots of flavour. It went really well with the maple syrup. At $6 a pop, it\'s not cheap but definitely should get!
Great for fried chicken and waffles and some southern iced tea :)
Tasted more like a dessert than a starter.. Sadly its the only tastiest food of the night!
This is extremely good I couldn\'t stop going at it despite having a huge fried chicken thigh and waffle to finish.
This is why I am not recovering üòÇ bad choices. No fate with Portico, wanted to head there on two occasions and it\'s closed, settled for southern kitchen! The waffle could be tastier though, still prefer Overeasy\'s rendition.
Went back to The Beast to use up my prize from the last eatup here. Thanks @burpple &amp; @thebeast_sg!
#Bacon lovers\' dessert‚Äî #TheBeastSG\'s Bacon Waffle Sundae: Candied bacon, pecan brittle, butterscotch, waffle and triple chocolate ice cream.
Back at #TheBeastSG for a little feast. Cant resist these Pulled Pork Sliders‚ÄîSweet, stringy, tender pork in cute little buns .
Went on a sunday for their brunch and love the friendly service. Lightings was slightly dim indoors and we have to make do with the best of the natural lightings from the window. Pulled pork hash was a tad overpowering for me as the charred flavour is quite strong; perhaps pull porked burger might works for me instead :p but we definitely love the poached egg laying on top which flows delicately upon the slicing of the knife.
Magic is made with candied bacon, pecan brittle, butterscotch, crispy waffles and fig &amp; honey ice-cream. Really good!
after much hype and peektures of this place - I found it a tad disappointing. no doubt the chicken was portioned generously, but de waffle failed to deliver. oh well.. TGIF otherwise
Can\'t wait to go back to #TheBeastSG for these yummy Pulled Pork Sliders!Thanks @burpple &amp; @thebeast_sg for running the photo contest and the vouchers! Who wants to go pig out?!?!?! ;P
Not just any donuts, but The Beast\'s famed Bacon Maple-glazed Donuts. Yup. Indulge in these sweet nuggets of joy on December 2nd, and all proceeds will go to Reach Community Services. This charity focuses on reaching out to families and youths in need of counselling and intervention programs. All you need to do is increase your sugar intake for a day! Round up your buddies and chase those donuts with a round (or three) of bourbon. You are at a Southern bar after all ;)
Brunch is available on Sunday between 10am - 5pm. \n<br />Here\'s Bourbon Pecan Pie ($12), home-made pie, fig &amp; honey ice cream. My pick among the desserts üç∞ More details on the blog. (Direct link in bio)
The best dish here in my opinion, check out my review on fatassbean.wordpress.com!!! Link up on bio!
Found this overwhelmingly sweet, though the pastry itself was nice and crumbly and buttery. The biggest disappointment, however, was the ice cream ‚Äì we were served vanilla instead of fig &amp; honey as the menu promised. 
Just knocked off and feeling ravenous ‚Äì could do with some yummy cheesey pasta and a side of deep-fried green beans dusted with a \"secret seasoning\".
While I like the buttery, crunchy crumble, the spiced peach filling was a little too sweet.  Cut down on the sugar when macerating the peaches &amp; it would be perfect! PS: I want that cast iron skillet! haha!
Getting back into the routine of waking up to an alarm; this day last week, I was still chilling out and looking forward to the Burpple Tastemakers Eat-up. üò™ This morning, I\'m craving for this warm pillow of dough garnished with butter and as much bourbon maple syrup as you want to douse it in. 
Chicken &amp; Waffles - Chicken soaked in buttermilk for 24 hours, seasoned &amp; deep-fried. The end result? Crispy on the outside, tender &amp; juicy inside. The waffle, though crispy, was too pale &amp; airy for my liking. Drizzled some bourbon maple butter sauce for a sweet-savoury combination!
Served with a perfectly poached egg and roasted potatoes, the pulled pork was moist and tender, it\'s indeed melt in your mouth good. Perfectly seasoned as well. \n<br />But the price tag is a little high for just a serving like that, but we are all happy paying for quality grub!
An interesting concept with Mac and cheese \"buns\", however we felt that the buns were bland. A lack of cheesiness and could probably use more salt. The patty was juicy and tender, but I think they could do better with an egg in between.
Doubles as a Birthday Burger too with 1.6 pounds beef patty, 1 pound pulled pork and 1 pound southern buttermilk fried chicken.
Had this meal for my lunch, the portion is big and it cost me $22. The bacon surprisingly is sweet, it\'s my first time had a sweet bacon. The chicken fillet is not that oily as well, overall I\'m satisfied with this meal. What I\'m most dissatisfied is that the cashier of this dining place is careless, they tend to charge wrong bill to your credit card. So beware.
Perfect as a side dish or eaten on its own, slathered with butter &amp; maple syrup. I kind of like this soft, dense and sweet cornbread. Brownie point would be given if it was served with a slab of butter than a dollop to balance the sweetness.
It was like watching a horror movie where the monster jumped out when you put your guard down. Stunned!
The cold ice cream with the warm peach crumble was so soothing to eat.
Maybe the previous dishes numbed my palate because I could tasted the fig and honey in the ice cream. Eating a cold and sweet dessert was like hitting a reset button on my taste bud.
The patty was tough and overcooked because of the gigantic size. \n<br />The chef combined three kind of meat - chicken, pork and beef into one burger. A interesting combination but not very fun for those who don\'t know how to slice (a burger). My take for those who want to challenge making such gigantic burger. Rather than trying to cook one big patty, spilt it into two thinner patty. Seared / grilled them for less than 15mins. Insert caramelized onion and fried mushroom in between the two patty. This way the patty could remained its size and improved on the taste.
Blackened Pork Collar atop a bed of mashed potatoes, fine beans &amp; bacon bits, drizzled with thyme &amp; garlic cream sauce. Ideally, pork collar doesn\'t dry out easily as it\'s slightly fatty but the pork collar we had was slightly dry. Then again, we took quite awhile to take photos, so that might contribute to the dryness. I like the mashed potatoes thou\'. Slightly grainy and infused with garlic butter. The bacon bits added a touch of smokiness to the mashed potatoes and I can\'t help but to eat a few more mouthfuls.
1.6 pound of Beef + 1 Pound of Pulled Pork + 1 Pound of Fried Chicken + 9 Inch Bun + Limited time of 30 minutes = Ultimate food challenge. \n<br />Don\'t forget the bucket of fries. Thank god that I ordered a bottle of ice cold beer!
The chicken was overly seasoned but saved by the sweet maple syrup. \n<br />Crispy fried chicken + crispy fluffy waffle = crispy sweet and savory combination.
Heavily clothed with the spices and slowly roasted with tender loving card. Such comfort food. \n<br />It will be better if they use better bacon and fried till super crisp. Then mixed with the silky soft mashed potato.
So full, but there\'s always room for dessert! The sweets stole the show at our tasting, with the pear crumble and pecan pie being the highlights. Plus points for the ice cream which remained solid throughout our food photography ;) | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Scrumptious mac &amp; cheese that was absolutely irresistible! | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
But after the first bite, there was more. However, it was rather dry.
Super cute and compact slider!
Thanks for the hospitality from @thebeast_sg, we managed to try their different dishes from starters to desserts. \n<br />The restaurant located in between of Bugis and Lavender mrt . It was a great place meet up and have a drink. They also had private room  for large group to host small events. Their food was rather over-seasoned to my taste (maybe it was because they served a wide variety of whisky and beer).
Fried mini donuts glazed with maple syrup &amp; topped with bacon bits. Love this sweet and savoury combination! üòãüç© 
Or mix it with their super sour Lemonade to create an Arnold Palmer which blends the two extreme flavours into a more acceptable sweet lemon tea flavour.
What do you get when you combine lemonade with sweet tea? That\'s right! Arnold Palmer, a refreshing thirst quencher named after the legendary American golfer of the same name.

The pale blond bed of batter was too light and airy to count for anything, but that hulk of meat tenderised for 24 hours in buttermilk and then deep-fried in a super-tasty batter clearly shone as the moneymaker. 
üç¥ And just realised The Beast Burger (The mother of all burgers) I posted earlier cost $125 üò≥
1.6 pounds of juicy beef patty, 1 pound of slow cooked pulled pork, 1 pound of southern buttermilk fried chicken and a good serving of slaw, lettuce and tomato wedged between a custom-made 9 inch bun, served with a bucket of fries. Adequately feeds 2 stoners or 4 adults\". Insanely huge burger! Could\'ve done with a bit more flavour. The beef patty is a little scary. This serves as a Birthday Cake too!

Home-made pie with vanilla bean ice-cream instead of fig &amp; honey ice-cream stated on the menu. People with sweet tooth will love this nutty pie! PS: Would love to try the fig &amp; honey ice cream thou\'...
The unexpected hero here is this humble dessert of peach slivers buried under debris of granola, evenly toasted so it\'s got an almost nutty crunch. Now, I\'m just wondering if a touch of salted caramel would help temper the sweetness of the ripe fruit. 
LOVED this!!! Kinda tasted like Taiwanese deep fried sweet potato. Slightly crispy on the outside with a tangy coating whilst the green bean is soft and sweet. I wouldn\'t mind having this again
Each Burpple eatup is all about great eats and even greater company as it is an opportunity for everyone to know each other and catch up as well. This time round we hit The Beast at Jalan Klapa which serves South American cuisine, ranging from signature items such as Corn Bread and Fried Chicken on Waffle. If you are a big eater and in for a challenge, try out The Beast Burger; a burger with three types of meat and lots of cheese to down. They also serve quite a variety of alcohol, so it makes for a great place for a hangout after-work. Being all about South American cuisine, expect flavours to be more extreme and sizes bigger than expected; you have been warned!
A mouthful of deliciousness! \n<br />#BurppleTastemakers at #TheBeastSG
The light, yeasty waffles when doused with sweet maple syrup really went with the crisp, tender and savoury fried chicken as it took away some of its saltiness to make it taste somewhat more balanced.
This was one of the sides that went down earlier tonight at our Tastemaker Eatup! The Cornbread is rather dense and dry. Wouldn\'t have minded more butter with this. Sweet dreams everyone! :) #BurppleTastemakers at #TheBeastSG
Blackened pork collar that was served alongside mashed potato, fine beans, thyme and plated with garlic cream sauce. A very meaty dish (though nothing compared to the beast burger)
HUGE Burger with sparklers, the new birthday cake? 1.6 pound of beef patty, 1 pound of crispy, southern buttermilk fried chicken, 1 pound of slow cooked pulled pork, generous serving of coleslaw, lettuce &amp; tomato wedged between a 9 inch bun = The Beast Burger. Served with a bucket of fries. The burger\'s so HUGE it\'s twice the size of my face!
Three of my favourite things baked in a scalding hot pan ‚Äì how not to love? 
Crusty mini rings of deep-fried dough cloaked with maple syrup and crowned with a little heap of sweetened bacon bits. Sinful and worth every last calorie. 
Here\'s The Beast\'s Burger, literally üçî
The last dessert for the night. Sinful is the way to describe this; fried doughnuts doused in maple syrup, with savoury bits of bacon on the top. Fits savoury-sweet lovers well, but a bit too sweet for my liking as well.
This month has been a fulfilling one for me, filled up with a handful of meaningful events to attend, a close friend of mine gotten married and many people turning a year wiser this month which means (a year older) üòù I genuinely hope that November will be a better month although my schedule is gonna filled up with many events again and likewise cherishing 2014 before it comes to an end. It has been a tough one this year, but that makes me stronger and bolder with greater things ahead, comes in and the worst gets out!
Peach was fresh and soft, but we thought that the crumble seemed a tad too sweet and felt as though we were eating granules of sugar.
This pitiful beauty was sitting at the centre of all the cameras and flash lights waiting to be indulged in. Thank goodness we attended to it before it got cold and soggy. One of the best crumbles I\'ve had! 
My favourite dessert of the night. The bourbon went really well with the pecan, which gave it a nice fragrant sweetness to the dessert. Vanilla Ice-Cream was not too sweet, so it actually matched up the pie well.
Three layers of meat: fried chicken, pulled pork and a humongous beef patty. This is not for the weak | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ
The Beast Burger!!! #biggerthanmyface #vscocam #burpple
The main star for tonight. This mega burger has three patties (pulled pork, beef and fried chicken) and even comes with fries. Found the beef party a bit too bland though, and the coleslaw seemed to have sogged up the pulled pork and the bottom bun. And all six of us couldn\'t finish I too ...
One of my favourite mains for the night. Loved that tender pork collar that was quite akin to a good medium-rare steak in texture sitting atop a slightly sweet mash. The greens were just as appealing; grilled and seasoned for some flavour! Something I would order!
Fried green beans with \"secret seasoning\". It felt a bit of a love-hate relationship with this one; while I loved the Cajun and salt seasoning it seemed quite heavy somehow.
Love that BBQ flavoured  pulled pork that was not only tender and just moist enough, but also had a tinge of charsiew flavour in it. Greens were also fresh as well, and bun toasted before serving.
While it hinted heavily of bacon and well-coated in melted cheese, the cheese seemed a little dried up so it\'s not that gooey. Overall this is quite decent, but the one at Marmalade Pantry at the Stables was just hard to forget.
This looked like Chiffon Cake, but was pretty light and tasted like pancakes with a crusted top, with maple and butter spread on top. Good for dessert too!
Both had rather extreme levels of flavour; one too sweet and another too sour. But mix them up in the right proportion to form Arnold Palmer, which is pretty addictive to drink for its just like ice lemon tea with a stronger flavour of zesty lemon!
Acclaimed as the mother of all burgers, this is The Beast Burger comprising 1.6 pounds of juicy beef patty, 1 pound of slow cooked pulled pork, 1 pound of southern buttermilk fried chicken and a good serving of slaw, lettuce and tomato wedged between a custom-made 9-inch bun and served with a bucket of fries. 
Here\'s their most popular brunch item - Pulled Pork Hash. Feels like eating deboned pork ribs! Yummy! And stay cool in this sweltering hot and hazy weather with their Freshly Squeezed Lemonade! :)
It can be an indicator that you\'re not enjoying work and weekend well. I hope not as I enjoyed mine well, and anticipating the next weekend fun to come. This is the Beastly poached egg from the pulled pork hash I had on Sunday. Need to go back to The Beast soon.

Delightfully battered with fragrant buttermilk, the tender juicy thigh meat goes perfectly with the crispy waffle. The maple syrup gravy cuts through the oil and adds another dimension to the taste. Absolutely shiok!

Besides the southern fried chicken thigh, which has been soaked in a 24-hour brine bath, the difference from the original was the sweet cornbread waffle, addition of a serving of Caesar salad and scrambled eggs.

Unleashing the hunger beast in us, one southern fried chicken at a time üò± The poutine fries were a nice change from the usual Chilli cheese fries as well, doused in sinful mozzarella and savoury gravy. Only drawback was that they don\'t accept Entertainer deals cos it was a public holiday...? üòû This wasn\'t stated in their T&amp;Cs  in the app so please check before ordering! Another interesting feature is their Beast Burger challenge, a pre-order dish where they prepare a 1.6 pounds beef patty burger for those with a ravenous appetite!

Be it grilled, cooked \"Bulgogi Style\", stir-fried or seared. This is one best kept secret! \n<br />The Beast has put the southern twist in cooking this home style yet restaurant-like pork dish. Tender and scoops bird with a creamy mashed potato and some drizzling of a pungent and piquant garlic sauce.  Dig in! Warning: Best enjoyed to share with friends. \n<br />The Beast Southern Kitchen &amp; Bourbon Bar, Singapore
Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside~
One of the best cornbread I\'ve tried in Singapore.. Crispy on the outside and \'cavelike\' inside. Just melts in your mouth. A must try when going to \'the beast\'
Super sinful, calorie-laden brunch to make the bf happy. I feel fat üòÇ
Just like us :)) @ahbonana_ @teototo haha \n<br />#throwback#potd#instafood#foodporn#foodstagram#foodphotography#vscocam#burpple#instapic
The sides are your standard fare but you should order this main just for the meat itself. \n<br />#ketohloh #8DAYSEat #burpple
We would have been fools to not order the {Blackened Pork Collar} as well. Garlic cream sauce over tender spiced pork slices. Mondays just got a whole lot better. #whati8today #thebeastSG #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #iwantsugar #foodporn #blackenedpork #igsg #sgfoodies #singaporeinsiders #cravings #igsg #ssfoodtrail #burpple
To cut the story short, my friends and I got cheated at The Beast last night. 
Can\'t go wrong with #Southern #FriedChicken and #bourbon maple #butter sauce. Chicken was amazingly well seasoned! Sweet and savoury, here we go!
Super tender and flavourful!

#TheBeastSG‚ÄîSouthern Kitchen + Bourbon Bar. A really nice place to chill out with friends. Service here is pretty good too.

Tomato soup as my starter and soft shell crab sliders as my main( is stated as bar bites on their menu) ambience is wonderful ! üòÅ is good to go back hunting for new food places
A combination of sweet and savory, but it would be better if the donut was smaller or we had bigger pieces of bacon instead!
BEST.
If there would be more cheese, it will be  prefect
Probably my favourite dessert of the night because it has bacon!!! üòç Sweet &amp; Salty.
The chicken was delicious &amp; tender. Goes well with the sweet maple butter sauce.
Pork was a little bland overall.
Deep fried doughnuts soaked in maple syrup and topped with bacon bits! It can get a little too sweet! 
Baked cornbread (that was soft and fluffy), bacon mac &amp; cheese, pulled pork sliders and jack &amp; the beanstalk (deep fried green beans with secret seasoning - my fave out of the 4!)
