Love the balsamic reduction that is added on to the dish as well
The truffle foam floating on the top is what made all the difference..the aroma of the truffle is harmoniously infused with the mushroom
With basil being the main ingredient, the \'grassy\' and herbal undertones of pesto is pretty much an acquired taste that not many will fancy.\n<br />Using pesto cream to make the green cones and topping it with spicy yolk mousse suggest a mishmash of distinct flavours that are entirely contrasting.\n<br />Bonito flakes which are usually paired with takoyaki are smattered on the mousse to complicate the flavours even further.
My kinda day.\n<br />ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼\n<br />This vibrant looking drink is watermelon, lychee, lavender and mint blended and cold pressed. I can taste the sweet watermelon with a tinge of mint and a very subtle lychee aftertone. I would not say it is \"wow\" but it had a clean and refreshing taste.\n<br />ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼\n<br />What mattered most was the awesome company. Thank you @boshemian @valtoire for the company. It was great catching up. Dont forget our next date.
The accompanying coconut ice cream had a distinctive flavour to it, sprinkled with coconut flakes!
The torched unagi is lightly charred on the surface and it is grilled till its texture is silky soft and buttery with a melt in your mouth tenderness. \n<br />Triple cooked chips are a type of chips or deep fried potato originating from Britain. Dont be fooled by its \'chicken nugget\' appearance. It is served pipping hot, incredibly fluffy on the inside and delightfully crisp on the outside.\n<br />Wasabi furikake (rice seasoning) and tobiko (flying fish roe) are smattered on the top to provide the final flourish

Deviled egg cones. Just like an ice cream cone filled with spiced yolk mousse. Cone is made of pesto. Under that glass klosh are three quail eggs. Using a smoke gun, the eggs are smoked. Once you lift up the klosh, the smoky aroma is released and it smells amazing.\n<br />ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼\n<br />Eating at Marble is far from boring as their plating are fun and mischievious. It is like almost every dish has a little surprise. I certainly had a nice time watching the behind the scenes. Therapeutic even!
The shredded blue swimmer crab meat and kaisho seaweed comes topped onto the risotto for the extra umami!
A concoction of Watermelon, Lychee, Mint and Lavender â€” one of the two slow-pressed juices available here which can be opted for their set lunch menu (soup or drink, main and a dessert) with a additional charge of $2.
Provides grand enlightenment if you ever wondered what would happen if a particularly gutsy aburi eel in mentaiko sauce hopped onboard a steaming hot tater tot. 3.7/5
Snugly resting in a heavy earthen pot which felt cool to the touch just because the pot was kept in a chiller.\n<br />â—¾â—½\n<br />Uncommon presentation of a somewhat simple and yummy dessert. Simplicity is just delish chocolate and ice cream.\n<br />â—¾â—½\n<br />A sweet ending to my 3 course set lunch at $17++. Address : 6 Everton Park #01-18\n<br />Hours : \n<br />1145 to 1700 hrs\n<br />1830 to 2200 hrs
ðŸ”¸ðŸ”¸\n<br />A porridge that is not a typical porridge. Pearl barley risotto that looked starchy but had no starchy feel. A creamy consistency with bits of swimmer crab. Seasoned with ponzu for that tinge of saltyness and tartness. A 63Â°C egg lights up the dish with its vibrant sunny glow and the flow envelops the pearl barley with a velvety embrace. ðŸ”¸ðŸ”¸\n<br />A nutty and comforting bowl, indeed.
Front of house Yu Zao. All whom are graduates from CIA (Culinary Institute of America) and good friends.\n<br />â—¾â—¾\n<br />One look at this, you will think it is a long black. Actual fact, this is the appetizer to the start of my set lunch.\n<br />â—¾â—¾\n<br />A Mushroom Macchiato presented to look like the actual macchiato. A hot and piping soup brewed from portobello, button and shitake mushrooms which took 6 hours to prepare. A very delicate but yet rich soup. If that is not good enough, it is topped off with truffle foam. Slightly creamy but definitely with a hint of truffles. Sip slowly like how you would with coffee.\n<br />â—¾â—¾\n<br />Really pretty and tasty. I like the way it was presented. Something out of the norm.
