Pretty generous with the smoked salmon! Quite a big portion that\'s good for sharing 
$15. Looked better than it tasted; there was hardly any truffle taste
Part 2 from Da Paolo Pizza Bar. Yay! Hahah. Okay, it\'s Rosemary Chicken w Avocado Pizza &amp; Crayfish Pizza (it has a more chim name, I can\'t remember, hahaha). #foodstagram #foodporn #pizza

My current favorite pair of cobalt blue flatforms! Haha I kid, the focus of the photo is actually on the Lemon Curd Pavlova 😂
Such a pretty Royale Stack! Down at Chip Bee Gardens to try their Weekend Brunch menu items this morning 😊
Anchovies craving satisfied. Pizza topped with tomato sauce, Mozerella, capers and anchovies. So simple, salty, but crispy, tasty and umami! Best pizza place ever, other than Mozza and L\"Operetta. The menu didn\'t mention but the pizza looks about 10 to 12 inch, \"the size of the menu\" as the waiter said 😁. If i recall correctly its $27.

This originally came with a tomato base but We asked for a switch to a white mozzarella base and it was out of this worldddd. 😋😋
