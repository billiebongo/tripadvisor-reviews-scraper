If u dine at Joël Robuchon, there\'s always a chance to try this Amuse Bouche. The \n<br />Royal foie gras custard with Red wine reduction and Parmesan foam. (Treated my wife to her birthday dinner here and we tried this same amuse bouche) For the RWS Food Affair, there\'s some exquisite Menu Dégustation and Menu Découverte for you to try! You should check them out!
