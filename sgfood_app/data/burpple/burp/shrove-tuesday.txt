Waffles with double scoop of green tea &amp; mao shan wang ice cream. Their awesome waffles are at 50% off on weekdays, 3 - 6pm. Shove your Monday blues away at Shrove Tuesday :)
While this seemed a little gimmicky at first, this was surprisingly good. Three scoops of ice cream were given, which is more than worth its price. It tasted quite authentic like real chendol, and the waffle was quite crispy and fluffy inside. Gula melaka is drizzled all over so will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. 
Waffle this time round was good, after a few bad times in the past. The chendol gelato was great as well, not too sweet with a bit of coconut fragrance. Gula Melaka sauce was quite light in taste but brings a nice sweetness to make it a cohesive dessert overall. Definitely recommended! $12 (including three scoops of gelato). 
Kinda meh, and you\'re probably better off with a real tiramisu. This was kind of too watery for my taste, and the matcha didn\'t do anything to enhance its appeal. It wasn\'t very creamy, and it fell flat. Quite unfortunately as it\'s quite a pretty looking dessert that cannot live up to its looks. 
The glazed and slightly sour waffle felt like a paean to slightly burnt toast, being crispy to the point of knife strikes plate with a clang, whilst elsewhere the rich gelato was expertly conservative in its sucre levels. 3.7/5
\"Waffles are pancakes with abs\" 
☕\n<br />-\n<br />It\'s my 2nd time here, and the first one was last haloween..! Time surely flies. 🙈🙈🙈\n<br />nice coffee, nice place, nice waffle. Light, crispy, and goes very well with the chocolate ice cream. They also have quite a number of cakes to choose from..! [including the rainbow cheesecake - should try this one day.] Even though there\'s not many [gelato] flavours available, but that could be a great thing. So you have less flavours to \'eliminate\' 👀 who\'s with me? 🙋\n<br />-\n<br />Ps. Come on weekdays between 3-5pm and enjoy your waffles with 50% off..!\n<br />-\n<br />☕ Cafe Latte\n<br />🍴 Awesome Waffle w/ 🍫 Gelato\n<br />💰 S$4.50 // S$5.00 + 2.50\n<br />🏠 Shrove Tuesday\n<br />📍 Block 94 Lorong 4 Toa Payoh [01-32]\n<br />🚅 Toa Payoh
Lavender chocolate mousse cake 🍫🍰, waffles at half price (because weekday 3-6pm) and apple pistachio tea 🍵. 😝
Puff with vanilla ice cream drizzled with warm chocolate sauce and some oreo bits. Yummeh! We even had beef lasagne and waffles. Even thou I hardly see anyone having their savoury item, lasagne was really daboommzz! One of the best I\'ve ever had. 😋 #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #shrovetuesday #allfornothing #dunnowerunforwhat
The ice cream was interesting- tried tiger beer n bacio; 3/5 as they melted pretty quickly 
Crispy and light waffles that\'s dressed simply with chocolate dessert, ideal for those who aren\'t looking for the cakey waffles, that goes very well with the chocolate gelato. Chocolate gelato was not too sweet but very decadent. Waffles at $5 each and gelato at $2.50 per scoop 
The waffle is light, fluffy and crispy. The cafe also have variety of cakes and beverages.  
As good as it looks! I really love the rainbow cake here. Doesn\'t taste artificial, really yummy! ;) 
It waz gooooooddd...😋\n<br />-\n<br />Crispy enough for you to hear that munch in your mouth, soft enough to realize it was a waffle [not a cracker 😂]\n<br />-\n<br />🍦 raspberry and rocher.\n<br />-\n<br />[And this photo don\'t do any justice] 😧
Situated in a quieter part of Toa Payoh, this place is a good alternative to the uber popular Creamier. Waffles was fluffier than most, and I enjoyed how the moscato &amp; Roche gelato went with it. I\'ll be back again!
While there was a long queue waiting to be served at Creamier, at the other side of the toa payoh nbh lies this quiet cafe that serves great icecream and waffles too! The best waffles texture i have tasted so far, although the selection of icecream is a lot fewer than Creamier\'s. Nevertheless, i enjoyed this toasted pistachio icecream on a very crispy and light-fluffy waffles :) 👍👍

Slice open to let the chocolate ooze out from the center. Also good morning to everyone! It\'s Friday but it\'s also school day. 😕😐😕😐🌞☀️🌚

$6 a piece. It tastes like snicker but with ice cream in it.
More of a dessert place and have a very limited selection of hot savoury food. Was pleasantly surprised though. The lasagna was well baked on the exterior and the chicken tomato sauce that goes with it was quite good. The chicken tikka actually goes quite well with the crispy airy waffles! We had a melon mangosteen and peach honeycomb tea as well! 
Had the salted caramel and biscotti gelato with waffles, didnt really like the waffle texture but the gelato was not bad.
ice cream was $5 for 2 scoops. 80 cents extra for each premium flavour. we had rum&amp;raisin and chocolate. the scoops were small but e waffles are really cripsy and yummy. \n<br />the place sold other dinner items like lasagna, pies and waffles w savoury toppings.
I didn\'t try them because I never liked macarons straight from the freezer. The shell will tend to have condensation and taste brittle. They will taste better when defrosted overnight in the fridge.
The latter was pretty and eye-catching from the outside. I did not really enjoy my desserts there as they were rather mediocre. The only nice things about the gelato bomb ($12) were the presentation and gelato, so it makes more sense to me in hindsight to order the gelato alone and save my money. In fact, the teas ($4.50 each) Peach Honeycomb and Melon &amp; Mangosteen, were way better than the desserts. Carrot cake ($5) was a flat slice and a bit too well blended for me. Should have gone for the waffles instead.
toa payoh now serves you award winning Italian coffee beans at shrove tuesday. my flat white was not as strong as i imagined it would be on first look. body was still on the weaker side but was nevertheless a decent cup of coffee. these days, so many flat whites to drink, so little time
Always on the lookout for interesting gelato flavors. Decided on a single scoop of KitKat at $3.50 just coz I felt like chocolate but didn\'t want to go with the usual chocolate option. Wished they had chocolate-chilli or dark chocolate-orange pairings. Oh well, decent tasting it was but more of an ice-cream consistency. Went well with the nothing-to-shout-about waffle at $5 that was dusted with icing sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup. 
Have I mentioned about how good the rocher ice cream was?? Waffles at $5, and an additional $2.50 for a scoop of ice cream!😋😋😋 only at #shrovetuesday!
But I really can\'t seem to taste how good, good waffles are. 😢
Not exactly impressed by its taste and it\'s really small too! 😩
His back is to you, but that\'s Ronald from Shrove Tuesday doing a Coffee Appreciation Workshop in my company. Great coffee and waffles! Check it out if you are in the area!
Been on a lookout for neighbor cafes/waffle places and this wasn\'t too disappointing. Light fluffy waffles with a slight acidic after taste. 
After eight flavored ice cream with waffles. Waffles was crispy &amp; nice.
Belgium #Waffles coupled with Vanilla Gelato. The Waffles here is extremely crispy and the fluffiness level is just average but it taste so much better when compared to Stateland! I wonder why? \n<br />I heard their batter here is involved with carbon dioxide, that\'s the reason why it is really good! 😊
Waffles were pretty good at $5! Light fluffy crispy. Added $3.30 for gelato (was an additional 80c for premium flavour) - got the raspberry lychee rose! small lovely quaint cafe with the cutest table.
Waffle with Roasted Pistachio ice cream &amp; Black Sesame ice cream. The waffle is crisp on the outside but still so soft inside. Price: $10.80. Major love! 💕
I have a terrible soft spot for waffles and ice cream. And a beautiful table to enhance the look of the (already) photogenic dessert makes it even better. Shallow minded, ha! Well, it\'s not all looks- this waffle is warm, has a light bread texture and crisp on the outside, yum! Top it off with a selection of ice-cream: I chose the raspberry rose- a little tangy and sorbet-like &amp; a lovely earthy scoop of earl grey. Happiness on a plate. 
Crepe brûlée was a bit heavy on the eggs, the vanilla wasn\'t really discernible though there are specks of vanilla beans in it. Wasn\'t sweet at all, all down to preference I think, but I would have liked mine to be sweeter. Waffles were as good as before, if only a little too airy. I like the texture of gelato here, standout flavours are moscato, hazelnut coffee and toasted pistachio!
New cafe just popped up in Toa Payoh, featuring as the name suggests waffles! I have not tried the waffles yet. Just came by for my usual long black and catching up on my reading. The coffee is smooth, balanced and easy on the palate. Good quality.
Easily the best Roche ice cream that I have tried so far!  Who said #shrovetuesday dun have yummy ice cream? Well I found at least 2 yummy flavours so far 😆😆😆
plus de ice cream were less sweet from my previous visit. kudos!
anyway this wasn\'t any good. too sweet and lacking of de vanilla taste. much improvement from my last visit though #throwback
Light, fluffy and airy waffles with a crispy exterior and a bread-like taste as they used yeast in their recipe for that fluffiness. Cheesecake gelato was slightly jelak to finish for one, but dab it on the waffle with each slice cut and it becomes a luxurious dessert to have.

Organic Italian beans used to make this Flat White, which is creamy, milky, smoky and nutty.
one of best in singapore. fluffy and crisp. however the ice cream was a little too sweet and after  giving my opinion hope tt they can make it less sweet
thankfully, it didnt let me down. overheard about this unique tiramisu on de previous visit. made fresh layer by layer. if I cant sleep tonight its gotta be tt shot of espresso below
Tiny pretty dessert with strawberry bites inside . Too sweet for my liking but too pretty that I must try it for once 
Nutty taste banana cake with peanut butter cream &amp; crumbs . Very moist And soft . My kind of cake choice 
Really delicious waffles! Light, fragrant, crispy, the aroma from the yeast complemented the smooth creamy gelato. Gelato texture is smooth and consistent, but most of the flavours fail to shine through. They are constantly reinventing the flavours though, as the place is relatively new! The weird matcha apricot profiteroles I had was frozen solid. Bad sign. The sourness metallic taste of apricot and aroma of the matcha didn\'t resonate well with my taste buds. Not much of a tea person, didn\'t taste anything special in the apple pistachio tea. Tasted like apple tea with a slight hint of almond. Skip it.
love the melon &amp; mangosteen tea for the fruity taste!
nutty yet sweet roasted peanut ice cream
fresh coconut ice cream. literally fresh

Mac &amp; cheese with Tikka chicken in butter curry. This was their recommended combination over waffles for the Tikka chicken. Mac &amp; cheese could be cheesier though it was balanced well together with the butter curry sauce. Tikka chicken was quite decent though I found the meat a little dry.

Place was pretty crowded today so decided to take-away.\n<br />Pleased to find my favourite Rainbow cheesecake (with different flavours on each colour) and the Lavender chocolate cake.\n<br />What a shame was the service was a let-down tonight with the lady behind the counter who totally lacked enthusiasm in making sales. Hopefully it was just one of those bad-hair day for her beating the Blues before Tuesday. #burpple #burpplesg #dessertsg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #dessertoftheday #rainbow #cheesecake #shrovetuesday #supportlocalsg

on another note, needing something sweet to perk me up.
This weekend Sunday, chill at this Toa Payoh Lor 4, cosy small cafe. The tiramisu quite soft. Can give it a try. 
Ice cream 
Yummy waffles with a scoop of Mao Shan Wang ice cream! 😋😋
#burpple
It’s like a combination of Affogato and tiramisu. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream within, and at the bottom there’s sponge cakes soaked with espresso/coffee and lastly top it off with frothy foam and sprinkles of cocoa powder. And its served with 2 pieces of biscotti at the side. I quite like this version of tiramisu except for the too much foam. Lesser foam and it will be much better overall.
Light fluffy waffles with hamburger steak. Waffles were pretty good, here at Shrove Tuesday, they use yeast in their waffles batter to give it a light airy texture. The dish was slightly dry though, so we requested for more sauce. Also tried their waffles with hazelnut chocolate gelato. Overall, a pretty decent place for waffles and gelato.
And nope, this isn\'t Magnum, it\'s wayyyy better than that😆 with a mysterious filling. Full story on www.dairycream.blogspot.com
Nope, it\'s 3/4 mine and 1/4 for @fundamentally_flawed But last Sat, I had 1/4 of the squid ink char Siew Bao while she had 3/4😆 Seems like some sort of unspoken contract has taken place but I think it\'s quite a good deal😁 Anyway, the BS 🍦 is really intense and nutty, though the sugar content across all flavours were askew.

Hurray for long weekend!
Triple layer of chocolatey goodness starting from a mousse layer, then a fudge and eventually a brownie. Sends one off to chocolate heaven!
$3 for a pop does not exactly make it really affordable, but these are well worth the money spent because they are just so chewy and really satisfies the sweet tooth. Chocolate &amp; Pistachio makes that sweet-salty combination while the Green Apple &amp; Cinnamon is just classic being nicely spiced and all.
In love with this waffle..  So crispy!!!

Crispy, light waffles which goes extremely well with the maple walnut ice cream. (With extra maple syrup and chocolate sauce too because why not?) definitely coming back to try more of their handcrafted ice cream!
