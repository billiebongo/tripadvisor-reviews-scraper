Their rendition of this jet black beauty was pretty tasty with the right amount of creaminess, but somehow a tad one-note; salt seemed to overwhelm the umaminess of squid ink. Texture-wise, it was a little more cooked than I\'d like, but I guess that\'s generally more acceptable for most locals. That said, my family still enjoyed it and it does provide great value for its price.
Besides the a la carte menu, they also do a number of special dishes on their blackboard, including braised beef cheek and a beautifully seared seabass, which was fresh and supple with a crisp, golden skin, paired with vongole &amp; vegetables in garlicky white wine sauce.
Fresh burrata at only $16? And not shabby at all, might I add. Although this one doesn\'t ooze like some I\'ve had before, it was still soft and creamy, nicely balanced with Parma ham\'s deliciously salty flavours.
The classic melon &amp; Parma ham combination reinterpreted in the form of a thick, chilled soup. It was refreshing in every sense of the word, but felt more like a dessert instead of a starter.

Tasty and a bit fatty, Foie Gras pairs perfectly with the mild delicacy of rise. An outstanding example is our exquisite “risotto al fegato d’oca” (in English, risotto with Foie gras).
