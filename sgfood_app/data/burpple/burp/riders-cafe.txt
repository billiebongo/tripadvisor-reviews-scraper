$18(+$3 for mushroom sauce, bacon and fried egg) the size is massive is swear! My better half had trouble trying to eat it hahaha!! Fries were surpringly crispy and tasty, burger was great but forgettable. 
The main catch was the caramelized üçå - absolutely crunchy on the exterior and moist and soft on the inside. Coupled with a refreshing {Boston Ice Tea} to beat the heat. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üìç51 Fairways Drive Singapore
Riders Cafe isn\'t the newest brunch place out there but it\'s still packed to the brim during the weekend. I personally made a trip down because I had 1-for-1 mains on my Entertainer app, but it turns out it doesn\'t apply for the Brunch menu! Still, it was enjoyable and I love how creative they were to place their Eggs benedict on top of a crispy crab patty. I\'m not a big bread fan, I admit so this was very welcomed.
Plump and fat scallops seared to perfection. Doesn\'t taste rubbery which is a good sign of not being overcook. Still can taste every grain of the rice without being mushy. Shimeji mushroom and kale enhances the flavor of the dish. This is what risotto should taste like. \'Seared Scallops Risotto ($26)\'\n<br />I wish there was more!! If you\'re lucky, you\'re able to see horses galloping at the nearby stable farm! Ambience was really relaxing with all the lush greenery. Location may be harder to find, and probably more convenient with a car. \n<br />Ps: try their \"Death by Chocolate Cake\" for chocolate lovers. Thank me later.
A good pile of fresh mussels, steamed with beer, and slices or chorizo sausage, so good.
Changed the salmon to mushrooms, so I could eat it. :\') Really sad that only one yolk flowed, while the other was just cooked too Long. Other than that it was quite a mundane meal. 
Escape the urban jungle and take the kids out into the lush greenery of Bukit Timah. Set within the grounds of Bukit Timah Saddle Club, this breezy cafe serves delicious weekend brunch favourites. Get a window seat overlooking the greens, and tuck into the Pacific Benedict ($18) ‚Äî poached eggs on crab cakes topped with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce. Order the Fried Chicken Goujons and Fries ($10) for the kids, and the Brioche French Toast ($16) to share for dessert. It comes with torched bananas, bacon and honeycomb butter. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends, when the cafe teems with young equestrian enthusiasts.\n<br />Avg price: $16 per person
Super disappointing after so many good reviews :-( the chocolate was just too cheap tasting and overwhelming, and the ice cream was vanilla but lacked the real tasting vanilla bean punch to it.
This comes with honeycomb, butterscotch and vanilla ice cream. Consider yourselves warned!
4.5 munchies: High-quality, soft and puffy brioche French toast served with burnt bananas, chunky bacon, and honeycomb butter. The star element of the dish was the caramelised bananas ‚Äì perfect crunch on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. I absolutely loved the balance of sweetness and saltiness in this classic breakfast!
Great ambience over lovely brunch!! Would rate it 8.5/10!! 
It was my first time trying something like that! Fried pound cake generously rolled in cinnamon sugar üëçüèº. You may choose to dip your churros in chocolate or vanilla sauce. I favoured the vanilla!
Bear in mind it\'s nothing like KFC Popcorn Chicken! It is popcorn with chilli-sea salt, dried fruits and seasoned nori. Great for sharing and warming up the stomach for mains!
200gm Angus beef, smokey cheddar, Branston pickle, house sauce and fries. Asked for medium but it came well done. A tad on the salty side but I liked the fries.
Brioche French toast with br√ªl√©ed bananas, bacon and honeycomb butter! $18! Heavenly on the first bite, then gets a little gelat after awhile. Perfect for sweet tooths though! :) 
Went there during near lunch break to try the food over there üòó
üòú We ordered two of their famous dishes Pacific Benedict ($18) and Brioche French Toast with Burnt Bananas ($16). Love that they sat us near the windows so we can watch horses go by.
Eggs Benedict paired with a glass of orange juice - Great food, awesome company and the tranquil ambience of lush greenery with horses trotting by. Perfection! (read my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg for a detailed review) 
Possibly one of my favourites now, these lemon ricotta pancakes were simply topped with a thin layer of jam, a knob of nut-infused butter that melts as you eat, and a serving of maple syrup. Sometimes it\'s the simplest of pancakes that impress. Nothing too fancy, just rustic pancakes done well and served with typical good ol\' condiments.
Definitely enjoying my long weekend, hope you guys too! üòé
5 munchies: Start your Golden Jubilee weekend right with this Watermelon &amp; Raw Snapper Salad ‚Äì topped with avocado, feta, edamame, onions, and mixed greens. I loved the thick chunks of super fresh raw snapper and sweet watermelon, which balance the flavours and textures of the buttery avocado, salty feta, and crisp-tender edamame. I\'d also highly recommend the Pacific Benedict and Peanut Butter Jelly Milkshake for a wholesome meal!
So hard to get to, but so worth the travel. Coffee and normal breakfast fare were decent and veeeeery reasonably priced, though they do a bad scramble. The pancakes were stunning. Not the fluffy kind, slightly denser and eggier. Our favourite of the meal!
4.5 munchies: What a brilliant combination of poached eggs, smoked salmon, spinach, and hollandaise on crab cakes! I loved the chunky and moist crab meat in the pan-fried crab cakes, while the hollandaise had the right consistency with a tinge of acidity. This is what a hearty brunch is all about, albeit the poached eggs were slightly overdone and there were bits of shell in the crab cakes. I also appreciated the great service by proactively checking on how the food was and even offering to get my poached eggs redone.
4.5 munchies: I\'d order everything on the table again, albeit the slightly overdone poached eggs: Brioche French Toast with Caramelised Bananas &amp; Bacon, Watermelon &amp; Raw Snapper Salad, Peanut Butter Jelly Milkshake, and Pacific Benedict.
It\'s love at first sight, gathered with the pool of chocolate accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
Crispy pieces of fried octopus with a side of mixed greens &amp; tatar sauce. Each piece was coated with their batter pretty evenly, making it extra crunchy with each bite! 
Vanilla chai tea latte &amp; hazelnut latte to go with a relaxed afternoon...
They play a perfect symphony in my mouth üíã LOOK at how the volcanic lava eggs flow in the background... I leave the mystery up to your imagination! One thing that makes me really happy: seeing how the egg yolk oozes out like a stream of gold hatching from a white puffy cloud!
Lunch special on the day of my visit was seared tilapia with rice shaped pasta $26. Price may be steep but no doubt this dish is divine. Would recommend and share among your group üëç
Realised they have a different menu from the last time I was here. Loving their specials today, Pan Seared Tilapia with Rice-shaped Pasta [$26]. On the other hand, the truffle fries is a disappointment.
Here\'s Death By Chocolate Cake w a scoop of vanilla ice cream $12 at Riders. No doubt it\'s sinful üòõ And waiting for @sophiensyy!
Cafe serves Western dishes. Notable was \"Death by Chocolate\" dessert that I almost believed their intention to murder us from the amount of chocolate fudge present. Cafe wasn\'t air-conditioned, only the toilet is. Can do an after-meal walk and interact with the horsies. Very fun!!

Their Christmas Breakfast special. Light, yet moist pancake with cream cheese topping. Not too bad. $14 for this portion.
A little pricier and inaccessible without car, it\'s still one of my favourite places to go to! Love the ambiance and great food. It\'s always packed so remember to reserve before heading down. 
Massive throwback and massive craving for something really chocolatey. And I really suck at taking pictures. Hahahaha!
the poached egg is just done right! with the good combination of portobello mushroom! and the oven baked tomato gives the sweetness and tint of sourish that refreshes the whole mouthfeel.
Enuff said. The chocolate sauce, the aromatic chocolate cake and that vanilla ice cream, and a hot day = awesomely perfect. Though I\'m not a choc lover, this went straight into my list of fav dessert now. Too good to be true, too good to be true. 
you can\'t see it in this picture, but the portobellos are huge!
Here\'s a huge slab of chocolate cake for the kid that still lives within each and every one of us! ^^ By the way, the cake is Death by Chocolate Cake from Riders Cafe! ;)
What went down very well for me was the scrambled eggs with scallion cream cheese. Loved how little chunks of the creamy, savoury cheese would suddenly announce their presence in the most delicious way whilst I was munching on the eggs. The mixed leaves salad and smoked salmon were delightful too.\n<br />What I wasn\'t that fond of was the struggle cutting through the bagel (which by the way there\'s only half of per serving). Yeah, bagels are kind of chewy, and maybe my knife was in a TGIF mood or something because it took forever to saw a piece off. Perhaps a better plating idea is to perch the bagel on top of everything else. So diners can simply pick it up, hold it in one hand to bite, while forking up the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon with the other. That\'s what I did and it worked very well :)\n<br />A key attraction of dining at Riders Cafe is how relaxed and pretty the whole area is. Being surrounded by open spaces of greenery is rare in Singapore, so it is quite a treat. 
Polenta is something I am more familiar with served as a side in a main course dish. More often than not, it\'s next to, or under a hunk of steak or grilled piece of fish. So this being so sweet didn\'t sit too well with me at first. But after a couple of more spoons, I found it palatable. Having said that, I wouldn\'t rush out and order this again because there are other items on the menu I\'d rather have.\n<br />Fans of polenta will be pleased to know though that this dish also includes two poached eggs, portobello mushroom, grilled tomato and sourdough toast. 
The Usual. Truffle Fries. And... Adding on two poached eggs and smoked salmon! üòª the scrambled eggs are really bad. Dry and hard. Worse than Macs. üòû but awesome company! üò∏üò∏ meowssss! There goes Sunday... #brunch #trufflefries #sunday
With fresh berries and vanilla mascarpone.. Love the berries so much
Shoot what it makes of.
Choice of two eggs with back bacon, breakfast banger, mushrooms, tomatoes and sourdough toast. 
Two poached eggs served with bacon, tomatoes, and hollandaise on sourdough toast. 
Lemon ricotta pancakes served with blueberry compote and maple butter. Suitable for the vegetarian option.  
Perfect combination of a warm chocolate cake top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The cake is slightly dry if eaten by itself but here comes the magic. The chocolate ganache is so velvety that it just fill the gaps between the layers of the cake and moist your every bite. Every chocolate lover shouldn\'t miss this.
Yummy runny eggs and crab...what else could I ask for!!! 10/10 I say! 
I am lactose intolerant but there is no stopping when it comes to peanut butter jello!!! Jello in my bello I am a happy girlie! 
Beef patty was good - moist and flavourful but could do with a tad more salt. You can change the fries to salad! Not the best burger out there but still above average. $19
One huge loaf of brioche toast, which was really good by itself. If only a little less soggy but the aroma of the bread made up for it. Unfortunately, the large amount of sauce covered the taste of pretty much everything, it goes well only with the fries. The oysters were large and juicy, tasted fresh and the batter that it was fried in light and crispy. Definitely recommend this. $16
As the name suggest, it\'s overly chocolate-ty. But it\'s really nice, for those of you who love chocolate to death.  Perhaps it\'s nice to have 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream instead of 1, to overcome that overly chocolate-ty taste haha. üëç
Love the presentation of the dish and the sylvan ambience. Quite the perfect setting for a brunch although the food could be seasoned more as it was a little bland. 
To have a feel of a different Singapore, take a trip down to Riders Cafe. Besides enjoying a hearty breakfast, one gets to enjoy a view of greenery and horses. Food wise, they have the usual breakfast fare and famous for the Pacific Benedict. However, the decision has leaned towards the Smoked Salmon Scramble with Scallion Cream Cheese &amp; warm Bagel with side orders of Spinach and Two Eggs (Scrambled).
Back to our fav place to eat and horse watch once more.
The Pacific Benedict, think I still prefer the traditional eggs benedict,  the \"seafood\" taste didn\'t really go well. @burpple
Back at #riders and thinking of my birthday brunch back in 2008. It\'s been a while.
Love their brunch. Tried The Usual &amp; The brioche french toast with burnt bananas, smoked bacon and maple butter. Had a good experience dining near the saddle. I could literally \'horse watch\' while having my brunch.
This is one of the main reason why many cafe hoppers wants to make a trip riders cafe so badly. If you ever visit them, be sure to try their dessert - Death by chocolate, sinful but delicious! It\'ll be best if you share it among at least 3 pax :)
Riders Cafe is an intimate restaurant serving contemporary comfort food at the Bukit Timah Saddle Club. With a view that can be mistaken for an English countryside and a to-die-for chocolate cake, we can easily imagine couples chopping down their guest lists to the bare minimum just so they can have their celebrations here.
1st day of 2014. Blessed with friends over a good coffee and grand mimosa
24th/25th Dec 13 Special Christmas special // NYE Special menu coming out soon. üòã
Sinful yet satisfying. But prefer the brownie to the chocolate cake, cause the chocolate cake is simply too rich!
Pacific benedict! This is super awesome especially there are swimmer crabs &amp; prawns inside! üòçüòçüòç
Lime Soda!!!
Hahaha. While the horse is eating dried wheat, I am eating fries.
Replacing the raved-about pancakes from its\' former menu, the Brioche French Toast is served either with Berries and Mascarpone, or with Burnt Bananas, Smoked Bacon and Maple Butter. If you\'re going for something more substantial, the latter is a better option. Of course, the best thing to come to Riders for is the perfectly relaxing ambience of lush greenery and fresh air.

Such a colorful salad!!!
This Salted Caramel Cheesecake with Crumbled Honeycomb is sooooo nice. Really no regrets on the waistline üòÅ
&amp; their perfectly caramelised bananas are amazing! üòçüòçüòç Totally didn\'t regret waking up at 8am for this! #burpple

Death by chocolate cake at riders cafe. \n<br />I wanted a mouthful but I almost finished everything.
Their must-order dessert if you are a chocoholic like me! Thought it would be overly sweet but it turned out bittersweet, just how I like my chocolates to be! Awesome! :)
Though the presentation wasn\'t exactly impressive, the taste was amazinggg! Just look at that thick beef patty! And the fries were seasoned really well! YUMS! :D
Hmmm.. we felt that there were better eggs ben around lol.
Although slightly pricier than a usual cafe, it\'s easy to understand why. It\'s always a privilege to be able to spend your Saturday morning watching horses in a vast green expanse, while digging into a refreshing bowl of bircher museli and fresh berries. Coming to Riders is always a nice treat after a week of hardwork.
Brunch with the Hubs! Roast Beef Sandwich with Truffle Fries. @mr_slacker
Drove and got lost LOL.. Ended up in clementi! So happy to finally reach in one piece
The bruschetta was quite good; it came with buffalo cheese. The creamy scallop risotto was a little too much for me as there was too much truffle oil. I guess I\'m the first person to complain of too much truffle oil! 
Hidden amongst the stables just off the PIE exit at Bukit Timah, Riders Cafe offers up simple and unpretentious brunch food! Nice open air seating and perfect for a lazy Sunday 
Very sinful #dessert but üëç
Beautiful flowers
Watching the horses and having brunch on a Sunday morning.
We went there for a lazy Sunday brunch after failing to make a same-day reservation. We had to walk around for about an hour while waiting for a table, but the wait was worth it the moment our food arrived on the table. We were too full to order dessert, but we will come back the next time for their famous chocolate cake.
Braised lamb with carrot mash and grilled dole asparagus; this was a trainwreck. The meat was so dry it was ridiculous.
Creamy risotto with seared hokkaido scallops, broccolini and truffle oil; looks and sounds waaaaay better than it tastes

Almond-granola fried chicken w creamy polenta and buttered spinach. Hehe posting food that\'ll get your stomach growling if you\'re still in bed
Served with seared Hokkaido scallops, Broccolini &amp; Truffle oil! It\'s pretty well done for a risotto for someone who don\'t fancy a dish like this! To all risotto fans out there, this is one of the place you should consider for your brunch on your weekends!
Let\'s called it the signature of one, which known for their burgers and fries and many others on the menu. I love it how the done-ness was served in the burger, two word(s)! Tender &amp; Juicy! It\'s hard to define one but the picture explains it all!
Smoked chicken salad serves with apples, walnuts, feta, radish and market greens! It\'s one of the most recommended items for your starters at Riders Cafe!
We ordered a portion good for sharing but truffle fries was a little disappointing (not enough truffle taste). I love how they add scramble eggs on top of our rosti thou. üòã\n<br />.\n<br />#reikovsfood #burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders #nomsterofficial #riderscafe #throwbackphoto #brunch #instadaily #love #potd

Cafe with a nice ambience. Enjoyed my food while peering at cute children learning Horseriding! Service is good here but the food is a little overrated. The chocolate cake was too sweet and the chocolate sauce tasted abit cheap. Loved the rosti but the sausages were a tad too salty. Nice place to chill in the late afternoon when there is lesser people! Brunch is served till 3pm on weekends. 4/5

We didn\'t manage to get a seat by the side (to see the cute horseys) but the interior of the cafe was nice bright and airy so I didn\'t mind. This was the Pacific Benedict, which was poached eggs on crab cakes. The poached eggs were perfection. I poked the yolk and the yolk flowed out like a waterfall over the crab cake, soaking the crab cake in yolky goodness (if this was what you like). I also liked that the eggs were not drowned in hollandaise. The crab cakes were not the best I have had, but decent enough. They were slightly too oily though. Overall quite a good experience in this cafe\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #sgcafes #sgcafehopping #cafelife #cafe #cafehoppingsg #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #ASandHP #crabcakes #eggsbenedict #brunch #riderscafe #sgfoodie #sgfood #reversedieting #reversediet

Death by Chocolate Cake! 
Dinner with the ladies! Not much variety for dinner. Will try their breakfast soon! 
Forgot the name but it contains crab cakes, smoked salmon on the top of two little poached eggs. Not bad to try it out! While my Little Joe ordered her own customized breakfast for herself. She\'s always that special. Overall just ok, 2.5/5
One of the greatest things I miss about the UK is their scones üò≠ English butter and dairy are just superior and you can really tell the difference in baked goods like scones that rely very heavily on the quality of those two crucial ingredients. Served warm, these were appropriately buttery but unfortunately a tad too dense and heavy. Kudos to the legit clotted cream though. 
I would drive there just to see the horses, while the brioche french toast with berries and vanilla mascara (pictured) is a bonus.
This is what happiness should feel, pure „Ç∑„Ç¢„ÉØ„Çª. \n<br />Definitely recommended for a large group to share because of its huge portion.\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood

(13) Riders Cafe - Cafe Latte, Truffle Fries, Chicken Taco, Riders Burger.. It\'s either u go their by car, or book a cab getting there, and to fetch you.. The place isn\'t accessible as it sounds.. but I was curious.. but ready did enjoyed the food.. I promise to come back for the horseback riding experience and the breakfast/brunch menu.. and make sure I get uncle, the very kind cab driver who offered to fetch coz he noticed it\'s not safe to just walk going out the saddle club.

Smoked salmon and creamed eggs with avocado on Turkish pide #sgfood #brunch
Egg Benedict
Personally the best place to have a morning breakfast..
Too good to miss - but best share this one after a big meal
Death by chocolate cake (w vanilla ice-cream) - 1,0000 calories worth of sinful indulgence
Shepherd\'s pie w mashed potatoes, lamb ragu and gruyere - tastes a lot better than it looks
Blackstone Benedict with bacon, tomatoes, poached eggs and hollandaise on sourdough
Smoked salmon on creamed eggs w avocado and Turkish pide
Pacific Benedict with swimmer crab and shrimp hollandaise sauce, lovely!
Definitely carb-worthy brioche french toast, so yumms!
Risotto with truffle oil. Oh yum. @euniceeunicee
Today\'s dinner catch: Rainbow trout.
