At Grilllo, you can get your fix of rice, bowls, skewers and sides. The Truffle Short Ribs Bowl is their signature dish and I especially recommend Shiitake Mushroom for skewers. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg

A lighter alternative to the Truffle Short Rib bowl, this came with two meaty pieces of salmon and diced zucchini. The salmon was lightly seasoned and the yuzu flavour was subtle. It tasted really healthy, but wasn\'t satiating for me as the portion was quite small.
4 munchies: Deep-fried to crisp perfection, the high quality, panko-crusted Nagano pork belly was moist and tender on the inside. For ultimate shiokness, scoop some Japanese rice and run both the pork belly and shiitake over the oozy onsen egg!
The textural experience of Grilllo\'s truffle short rib bowl was just on point. Truffle taste was obvious enough, but not to the extent where it drowns out the taste of the beef. The slices of thick, juicy and slightly pink beef was nothing short of spectacular. At $14.90, it was extremely value for money.
One of the stalls at Pasar Bella (Suntec) is Grillo, which I\'ve patronised several times for the donburi. My fave is this one - Japanese rice topped with beef slices, an onsen egg and fried garlic chips, and drizzled with a sweet, truffley soy sauce. I thought the garlic and truffle went really well together, and the beef was a tender and juicy medium. Will recommend it!
Would love to try their yuzu salmon bowl as well. Love the short grained rice, especially after mixing with the runny egg üòçüç≥
It\'s back to work tomorrow at @sunteccity, what better way to get a head start than to plan for a hearty lunch or dinner in advanced? Check out Grillo\'s wholesome spread of Pan Asian classics with a modern twist - including crowd favourites Truffle Short Rib Bowl (S$14.90) and Truffle Lotus Chips - addictive!! (S$3.50), as well as the Classic Chicken Bowl (S$11.90) and vegetarian-friendly Garlic Tofu Bowl üç¢üç¢ (S$10.90). Mix it all up with that perfect slow-cooked egg, and your lÃ∂iÃ∂fÃ∂eÃ∂ meal is complete! üòé\n<br />============\n<br />Thanks @geekyelephant and @grilllosg for the tasting invite last weekend, and the generous, yummy spread üòòüòò
Head down to Grillo at Suntec city @pasarbella üòã
Classic chicken bowl - grilled chicken with onsen egg, added on grilled zucchini and shitake mushrooms atop a bed of Japanese rice.\n<br />Chicken was superbly tender, egg perfectly runny and mixed well with the soft bed of Japanese rice! 
situated in suntec pasarbella. affordable and heavenly. damage $14.90\n<br />do check out the garlic tofu too $3
Spoilt for choice at Parsabella.\n<br />Always wanted to try this Grilllo rice bowl.\n<br />Selected the pork belly rice bowl. The pork belly is crispy on the outside and soft inside. You won\'t regret having this rice bowl with the grilled mushroom.
And I\'m so in love with the Truffle Short Rib bowl ($14.90) for all the yummy wagyu beef. It\'s better than Tanuki Raw, if you ask me. \n<br />Don\'t forget to add the Truffle Lotus Chips ($3.50) on the side. It\'s addictive as hell üòõ
Had this great find for lunch at $12.90. Located at Pasarbella Suntec City, Grilllo is the first stall you see as you enter this hipsteresque food court from the right entrance. Only a short wait (7 mins at lunch hour) from the time I paid till the time my coaster pager started buzzing. 
Grilllo serves such tender prime beef to go with their truffle-drizzled short grain rice. 
Encountered this dangerously addictive side dish today. Even as my brain shrieked \"Noooooooo!!\", my fingers were helplessly drawn to pick up yet another crispy deepfried lotus root chip covered in squiggles of lusciously creamy truffle mayo. üôÑ Sigh... Clearly, I have no self-control.
My favorite Grilllo Signature Bowl is the Truffle Short Rib Bowl ‚Äî a sous vide then pan seared USDA Prime beef with a slow cooked egg, crunchy garlic bits and drizzled with truffle wafu sauce. Since this is a beef bowl, I appreciate that high quality beef that is tender and flavorful was used! 
The USDA prime beef has the nicely charred flavor while the accompanying slow-cooked egg and crunchy garlic chips complements each other nicely. To go with the rice bowls, there are also a selection of sides such as garlic tofu and sticks of skewers for you to choose from. Now, there are also several promotional items such as spicy crunch prawns and truffle lotus root chips which make a great snack to munch on.
To my dismay the salted egg sauce was more salty than eggy and rather one note. The thick batter was a tad too oily for my liking as well but fortunately lived up to its name of being crunchy.
These fared better than the Golden Crunch Prawns, smothered in a nacho-esque cheese sauce with a faint hint of habanero. The heat could definitely be kicked up a few notches though.
My favourite out of Grilllo\'s 3 new promotional sides -- an inviting pile of wafer thin lotus root chips, deep-fried to shatteringly crisp perfection, then sinfully topped with creamy truffle mayo for an addictively rich and crunchy party in your mouth. So good you\'ll want to inhale the whole bowl, sharing be damned.
I am a voracious meat-eater but this vegan rice bowl with the large cubes of garlic tofu, very juicy grilled zucchini and mushrooms has the ability to tempt me over to the light side. If only for a moment. üòÑ
Fatty hunks of panko crusted Nagano pork belly delight first with an initial crunch, followed by gloriously melt in your mouth fat and tender meat. Split the egg and run pork through it for a saucier experience.
Hearing the words \"Pork Belly Bowl\" got more than a few ears perked up at our invited tasting session this afternoon. True enough, Grilllo\'s new signature bowl went down really well with most of us. The chunks of superior quality Nagano pork had been coated in panko crumbs before being deepfried which made them extra crunchy all over, while sealing the juiciness within. For more \"shiok-ness\", I recommend breaking that perfect onsen egg and using it as a dip for the pork.
Delicious beef don drizzled with teriyaki (?) sauce peppered with black truffle bits and fried garlic. The onsen egg is a wonderful complement. The bowl is very balanced in both texture and flavours, it\'s a must try ;)
While everyone\'s forming a train to Timbre+, I figured that it was finally a good time to pay a visit to Grillo at Suntec and their famous truffle beef short rib rice bowl alongside the backup of chicken tsukune.
Ravenous meat fiends not sufficiently sated by Grilllo\'s Truffle Short Rib Bowl alone can dig into smoky and succulent Chicken Tsukune($2), Chicken &amp; Leek($2) and Dory($2.5) skewers, amongst others.
Delicate pieces of thinly sliced tender beef short rib coated in a subtle truffle sauce, wobbly onsen egg, and those fried garlic chips make this a winner for me, especially at that hard to beat price. Pity about the inconsistent quality of the rice, which was slightly mushy and overcooked.\n<br /> \n<br />Taste: 3.5/5
For a lighter option go for the Yuzu Salmon Bowl with 2 healthy sized grilled salmon skewers and zucchini. My first piece of salmon was a tad overcooked but the second piece redeemed the bowl by being moist and tender. The yuzu sauce was barely discernable but was nothing a squeeze of lemon couldn\'t fix.
I simply can\'t get enough of those tofu cubes drenched in an addictively garlicky sauce strong enough to keep any bloodthirsty creatures of the night at bay. The intensity is upped another notch with the addition of crispy fried garlic. If you\'re mad about garlic like I am, this is the signature Grilllo bowl for you.
This signature rice bowl at Grilllo, Pasar Bella Suntec, comes with a side of delicious slaw. Especially suited for those who love their truffle infused foods, the fried garlic adds a little texture and lots of aromatic flavour to the dish. Mix it all up in the bowl for a quick yet tasty meal.\n<br />#Grilllo #SuntecCity #PasarBella
Portions (for the beef) are obviously smaller than at Fat Cow, but at less than 1/3 the price (of their cheaper lunch set) I think this tasty dish more than suffices.
Garlic Tofu Bowl ($10.90), Truffle Short Rib Bowl ($13.90), Sweet Potato Fries ($3). Really quite filling and good -- I could barely finish my bowl! Protip: ask for more garlic chips. 
Upon seeing food, I am resurrected. Upon eating, I went to heaven üòá Truffle Short Rib Bowl ($14.90 nett) gets a big thumbs up from me!
Relatively new to the scene! This is exclusively at pasarbella@suntec city. Doesn\'t look like much for $14.90 but looks can be deceiving! A delish bowl of thinly sliced short rib seasoned with black truffle and finished with an onsen egg in the middle... #yums #LC
Smells amazinggggg \n<br />$15+? Cant remember but the meat was just right.. a bit salty\n<br />Too small for my big appetite
First caught my eye when the next table ordered it... ‚ò∫Ô∏è Finally came back and tried it - tummy was not disappointed. The onsen egg was nice and runny, adding a creamy richness to the rice. The truffle short rib was tender and flavorful. The star: the crazy awesome shiitake - so unassuming yet bursting with juicy goodness. Loved the garlic chips - would be great if they gave a lil more! S$14.90 for the Truffle Short Rib Bowl and S$1.50 for the Shiitake Skewer. Totally worth it - happy belly! üòã
Truffle short ribs rice bowl - tender beef slices marinated with truffle, matched with an onsen egg, mushrooms and fried garlic thrown in for good measure. It\'s good! 
Only to discover such an affordable truffle short rib bowl at $14.90. Would choose this over tanuki raw every time.
The truffle infused soya sauce, onsen egg and tender short ribs were just deli:)) I still prefer Tanuki Raw\'s version because of their furikake rice:) but this set is pretty worth it because it comes together with a salad at the price of $14.90.
($14.90)Price point; much better than tanuki. Can\'t wait to have this again! Also, please try their garlic tofu ($3)!!
($14.90) - Wasn\'t blown away but overall pretty decent for its price. I can\'t recall but I MIGHT prefer Tanuki\'s version (just an excuse to go and try again to confirm üòõ) This set comes with a small salad. The short rib slices were so thin but at least they were tender with a good ratio of fats. Perfectly done onsen egg, and I loved the fragrant truffle which was not overpowering! I usually avoid garlic but actually liked the crisp garlic bits that gave a little texture to the rice bowl. Thought the rice was nothing spectacular so ratio of sauce to rice could be improved. 
Truffled short rib bowl $14.90 and Yuzu salmon rice bowl with beef tsukune. That bowl of truffle goodness, I prefer this to tanuki\'s üçö
TRUFFLE Short Rib Rice Bowl and Yuzu Salmon Rice Bowl with Beef Tsukune from #Grilllo #Pasarbella :D #burpple
Enjoyed the truffle flavors and tender steak strips. Feel that they can put more effort into the rice. Straight up soya sauce and very regular tasting rice. Still, my most enjoyable dish from pasarbella today. 
Spoilt for choice at the newly opened Pasarbella in town, but Grilllo is definitely one of those you should try! The distinct aroma of truffle and tender beef slices were absolutely irresistible. Though the portion appeared tiny (nothing like what the photos make it seem), it was surprisingly sufficient. Oh, and did I mention that lovely onsen egg in the middle? üåüüåüüåüüåü
Located in PasarBella (Suntec), this melt in your mouth, chewy tender beef meat is to die for, literally. Lightly drizzled in soy-truffle sauce, the bowl is fragrant and not overwhelming. Oh and those deep fried garlic slices, are stella, adding more flavour and texture to this already lovely bowl. This bowl has a slight edge over the already famed tanuki-bowl, with their oh-so-fluffy rice, and extremely runny onsen egg! Jjang üëçüèª
I just can\'t help it. I was there for something else but the fragrant truffle smell just lured me straight to Grilllo @ Pasarbella.
missing the affordable truffle yakiniku don at tanuki raw while they‚Äôre undergoing renovations?head over to @grilllosg located in in the new @pasarbella in suntec city where you can get your fix of something similar. in fact, i prefer grilllo\'s version of this dish over tanuki‚Äôs. priced at $14.90, just $0.10 more than tanuki‚Äôs truffle yakiniku don, i felt that the short ribs used in grilllo‚Äôs version were of slightly better quality. also, can we take a minute to appreciate that beautiful egg please? with crispy garlic chips scattered all over and a light drizzle of truffle soy sauce over the bed of fluffy rice, this dish definitely made for a satisfying meal.
From Grilllo at Pasarbella Suntec. They seemed to have switched their concept by selling rice bowls for mains (Yakitori remains as sides but the rice box sets are no longer available). For $14.90 for this set, you get a salad with the rice bowl. This was actually pretty good; Short Ribs were sliced thin, but tender and with a pinkish centre without being rubbery perfumed by a short hint of truffle which balances the flavours of the bowl rather than overwhelming it; simply the perfect amount of truffle flavour needed. Rice comes flavoured with savoury sauce, and mix up that runny yolk for more silly smoothness in a bowl. Certainly loving this bowl of goodness that it\'s tempting to go for a second!
New within the newly-opened PasarBella at Suntec City is yakitori stall Grilllo. Order the skewers √† la carte for a light snack and try the juicy Chicken &amp; Leek ($2) and the flaky Salmon ($2). For a value for money deal, opt for the Grillo Box ($9.90) and choose from nine sets of preselected combination of skewers instead, with a choice of two sides such as wild grain rice or cabbage and carrot salad plus a sauce ‚Äì go for Smoky, for a more pronounced char-grilled flavour. The set also comes with a Brown Sugar Mochi ($3, √† la carte), which isn‚Äôt overwhelmingly sweet.
@GrillloSg makes awesome snapper and sirloin sticks paired with what might just be the best range of sides in yakitori history to complement #YourFixOnSticks - wild grain rice, sweet potato fries, cabbage &amp; carrot salad, and edamame &amp; corn. Too good not to share. #YesFoodGetsMeExcited
From Grillo at Pasarbella Suntec City. Loved how soft the mochi was without being too excessively sweet nor sticky, carrying a light subtle brown sugar sweetness while dusted in sesame powder.
From Grillo at PasarBella Suntec City. Serving skewers, the skewers are dipped into sauce and grilled upon order. Salmon was flaky and supple, carrying a smoky flavour and coated in teriyaki sauce. Chicken &amp; Leek was succulent, tender and crunchy while the Beef Tsukune was well-packed with minced beef; both were also coated in savoury teriyaki sauce. You could also opt for the meal, which comes with 9 sets of mixed Yakitori to choose from and a selection of two sides with a dessert.

Tender, slightly chewy beef slices with an intoxicating whiff of truffle oil. Rather pricey, an occasional splurge, though not my favourite üòù Available at Pasar Bella at Suntec City.

Unfortunately, the Yuzu Salmon Bowl ($12.90) wasn\'t as great as I remember it to be. To be fair, the last I had was the beef don which was absolutely melt in your mouth. But this one...

Had a lovely brunch over at Grilllo at Pasarbella Suntec with their signature bowl, skewers &amp; new sides (Golden crunch prawn with salted egg yolk sauce, Truffle lotus chips) last weekend. Thanks for having me. Have a great week everyone!
Savoury, eggy goodness. 
Much better than the short rib bowl from Tanuki Raw IMO.
I like how the vendor mix is coming along with the addition of Sarnies (good coffee) and my favorite Choo Choo Korean fried chicken (opening soon).
