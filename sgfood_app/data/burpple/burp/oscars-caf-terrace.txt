Got the oriental edition bear! Wishing all a happy lunar new year in advance!
Good Tuesday morning! Here\'s the delicious Braised Monkey Head Mushroom, enjoyed with Abalone and Fish Maw, from #GoldenPeony, #ConradSingapore.
Their latest promotion featuring full-flavoured dishes from Latino locales, such as Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru is available now through 4 Dec.
😂😂😂😂😂. Waffles with dark chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce and maple syrup.
Just because they look so tiny and cute, and come in a lovely takeout box. Not the best I\'ve had, just sweet, but so pretty. Btw, their Royal Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch cake is really yummy!
#ConradSingapore\'s mustard &amp; honey glazed Roasted #Christmas Turkey, enjoyed with chestnut stuffing and cranberry sauce.
Oh so tender! One of the better dishes.
Zhng-ed my waffle with chocolate and raspberry sauces, choco pops and five little gummy bears. 😋 
Sumptuous spread at friend\'s wedding dinner tonight. Yummy individually-served Chinese courses and a surprise dessert buffet at the end! Nice! Congrats to the new Mr. and Mrs! ;)
Nothing is as sweet and powerful as the love from above.

maple walnut ice cream with waffles. this  home made cannot be found elsewhere and complements well with the tatsy waffle batter (much better den most cafes i\'ve been too). on a side note, request for this flavour during reservation as dey dont serve it always.
Some of the offerings avail at deli concept The Terrace. PS. Their famed stollen (perfect as gifts) is already on sale!
Swiss Chocolate. Another scoop. You can tell I like ice cream!!
Time to let stress sail away like this Australian abalone on his Japanese beancurd ship through a delicious sea of gravy. #ConradSingapore #GoldenPeony #CNY2018 #MediaTasting

Totally enjoyed the awesome buffet dinner!
.\n<br />The plating of the desserts is absolutely beautiful. The egg shaped bird nest jelly served on top of candy floss. Recreating the feeling of bird eggs in a nest. As the bird nest jelly has a lighter flavour, I suggest you finished the bird nest jelly before you start with the sweet candy floss.\n<br />.\n<br />The Fried \'Nian Gao\' with Sweet Potato and Yam remain delicious as ever. A must have dessert during the Chinese New Year with its auspicious meaning.\n<br />.\n<br />Full review of \'Celebrate CNY 2017 with Golden Peony\' is available at Chubbybotakkoala.com or follow the link in my IG profile page.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #cny2017 #cnydinner2017 #birdnest  #whati8today #whatiate #conradcentennialsingapore #goldenpeony #hungrygowhere #tradition #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgigfoodie #singaporerestaurant #singaporerestaurants #chinesefood #chinesefoodsg #stfood #thefoodjournalsg #omysg #omyblog #sgfood #sgrestaurant #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #festive2017 #burpple

Golden Egg Bird\'s Nest Jelly by Executive Chinese Chef Ku Keung.\n<br />.\n<br />Beautifully plated dessert. The Bird\'s Nest jelly in the centre looks like an egg, while the candy floss act as the nest. The Golden \'Nian Gao\' with sweet potato and yam provided a nosyalgic feel to CNY.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #cny2017 #conradcentennialsingapore #goldenpeony #whati8today #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #igsgfoodie #sgig #sgigfood #singaporerestaurant #singaporerestaurants #finediningsg #dessertsg #birdnest #instafood_sg #instagoodsg #foodpornsg #STfood #SGFoodies #instasg #instayum

(Menu differ) .\n<br />One of the food I come for is this QUAIL EGG BENEDICT with TRUFFLE HOLLANDAISE! Quail egg drenched in creamy truffle hollandaise sauce on a bed of spinach, ham and crispy biscuit. They come in such small cute portion! Seriously....I am so into this that I have come umpteen times 😅😆 . \n<br />What I truly enjoy about this high tea session is the privacy and peacefulness as compared to other popular tea lounges which gets really crowded during the weekends. Lounging in the comfy couches amidst live piano music in the background, to me this is a moment for relaxation and rest ☺️.\n<br />#foodpornasia #foodstamping #Singaporeinsiders #hightea #huffposttaste #foodspotting #foodstyling #foodgawker #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgig #instasg #eatoutsg #taitai #onthetable #igsg #fooddiary #f52grams #whati8today #icapturefood #forkfeed #burpple #hungrygowhere #eggporn #hightea #eggbenedict @conradsingapore

Quite addictive for those who love this carbo dish.
Can you spot which is from which country?
Never been much of a fan for gimmicky snow skin types (except for those with green tea/coffee/alcohol). Savory always wins.
