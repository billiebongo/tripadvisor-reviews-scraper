Was really excited to try a burger with a local twist and this XOXO burger was quite a masterpiece. Other than the tender and juicy turkey patty, there was this really interesting patty made of bacon, shrimp and scallop which was goooood. Since this burger has ingredients more on the heavy side of the palate, the lighter kaffier lime mayonnaise managed to balance the overall taste really well. However I didn\'t enjoy the buns cos I thought they were a bit too thick and dry. If only they have the buns from Burger Buddies, the combination would simply make it as one of the best burgers around!
I usually like to eat burgers with my hands but this was quite huge so I ate it with the utensils instead. Price wise - every burger is at $14 and I wouldn\'t mind coming back to try others again (and perhaps eating with my hands!) 
25 Degrees is a burger joint from L.A. whose name is supposedly derived from the temperature difference between a raw and well done hamburger. Sounds pro right?\n<br />.\n<br />If you have tried, do u like them? I do!\n<br />.\n<br />Where to find this?\n<br />25 Degrees @25degreesinsingapore\n<br />📍\n<br />200 Middle Road, Hotel G, S188980 ⏰\n<br />Sun to Thu: 11am to 1am\n<br />Fri/Sat: 11am to 3am\n<br />.\n<br />#freewifisg
|\n<br />The idea was for the thick bun to soak up the juice of the patty. The caramelized onion, bacon and garlic mayo (I think) gave the overall seasoning to the taste. However, the size was a little too big for my liking. Even the patty was juicy, it was dripping out from the side. .\n<br />|\n<br />I would recommend to go for their lunch promo. $12 for burger instead of the regular $14.
Only realised there\'s blue cheese while googling as we sat and wait for our order, but luckily it\'s not that overwhelming 😅 Was recommended to have the patty medium, but found it dry and pretty bland. Medium rare should work better. Seems like fries either came heavily seasoned or unsalted. I gladly exchanged the latter for someone else\'s 🤣 We all felt very thirsty after the meal, luckily they provided iced water 💦
Oh wait, that\'s not the song is it? Anyways, 25 Degrees\' Number Two ($14++) is similarly memorable thanks primarily to its stellar patty.
Created in collaboration with Mastercher Asia alumnus @lennardy is this burger which comes with interesting elements such as the house-made XO sauce, dried shrimp, scallop and bacon patty, turkey patty and kaffir lime mayonnaise. This special burger is only available between now till end August 2017.
House made XO sauce, dried shrimp, scallop and bacon party, turkey party, kaffir lime mayonnaise. Co-created by @Lennardy and @25degreesinsingapore At $14++. Just had it today and available till 31 August!
Dont quite remember what\'s in it but the flavour combination was pretty tangy. Beef patty was decent but the avocado didnt really make an impact. The buns were not as fluffy as i hoped. Overall the burger was decent but it would be much better with thinner and fluffier buns so as to be able to properly appreciate whats between
The burger was huge! Fat juicy fatty tucked between two fluffy buns was just perfect. The thick slices of bun managed to soak up all the juices that the patty released from every bite! I liked how the tomato juices also mixed with the beef patty, forming a unique concoction of beefy and tomatoey goodness! Buratta cheese was milky and light, adding a hint of richness to the burger. Good value for the price to food ratio!

.\n<br />🍴\n<br />Number one, caramalised onions and gorgonzola blue cheese was an amazing combination with the beef patty. Plus that touch of bacon 🤤. However, together with the thousand island sauce, it can get slightly jelat as you reach the end of the burger and will almost definitely ditch the burger buns, no matter how soft and fluffy they are\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />Number two, burrata sits in the centre like a surprise centre together with a roasted tomato half. The pesto sauce with beef patty, makes this burger a slightly lighter option than number one. .\n<br />🍴\n<br />Number three, the most fragrant of all 4 burgers due to the jack cheese. Green chili gave an extra kick making you want to eat more as you work through your burger.\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />Number four, yellowfin tuna burger. The burger I chose because I\'m adventurous and different like that. Strong smell of fishiness as I put the burger to my mouth. Crispy onion rings, turned soft a bit too fast. And the aftertaste of tofu didn\'t go well with me. Maybe it would be better w a slab of seared tuna? 🤷🏻‍♀️\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />We also got a mixed platter of curly fries and onion rings. The self fried onion rings has a very thin batter, so it\'s best to eat them fast. Curly fries are almost like macdonalds but more expensive 😜.\n<br />.\n<br />🍴\n<br />My verdict is stick to the beef burgers and you won\'t go wrong. I can\'t place which is the best because they each have their own unique strengths. But at $14 per burger, it\'s a steal for the big fluffy soft buns and delicious fillings (except for yellowfin tuna 🤣) The burger alone will definitely leave you full! .\n<br />🍴\n<br />Do participate in #BurppleBurgerMonth as well!

1KG burger includes a 25-degree beef patty, fried chicken patty, and turkey patty. Plus cheese and thousand island. Pretty worth it. The beef patty is pretty interesting, different from others that I\'ve tasted. 
Beef Patty, Caramelized Onions, Crescenza, Prelibato Gorgonzola, Bacon, Arugula, Thousand Island
though this burger looks big, one can easily see that most of the burger is made up of bun. the patty was juicy but a little overdone. the cheese was pungent and very strong. it threatened to overpower the burger, but was tempered by the presence of rocket. 
This diner-style space on the ground floor of Hotel G is where you should head to on your next \"treat yo self\" day. Swing by with your friends during lunch on weekdays (11-3pm) to take advantage of their Lunch Special ($18). This gets you a complete meal comprising of a signature burger (regular price $14), French fries (regular price $5) and half a pint of beer (regular price $12) or a soda (regular price $5). There are five signature burgers to choose from, of which we liked the Number One and the Number Three best. Both come with a juicy, well-seasoned patty of ground sirloin, cooked to your preferred doneness. Number One comes stuffed with caramelised onions, blue cheese, bacon, arugula and with Thousand Island sauce, while Number Three comes with Mezzo Secco Jack cheese topped with green chilli, chipotle and avocado. For burger enthusiasts, go crazy customising your burger with an extensive selection of ingredients including 12 types of cheeses! \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh
Ofcaz first you have to be a cheese lover. And the beef is nicely done according to my preferred choice of medium raw. #tbtsaturday #tbtyesterday •\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#macncheese #realburger #foodielife #foodporn #foodinsta #burgerporn #burgergram #saturdaynightout #burpple #sglife #instafood_sg #instafoodie #instafoods #instafoodies #instafoodporn  #foodiegram #foodislife #foodies #foodblogger #foodblog #foodbloggers
This amazing, &amp; oh-so-sinful Cheesy Mac Burger ($18) is one solid gold winner of all burgers. \n<br />Instead of buns, you\'ve got yourself two Mac &amp; cheese deep fried patties that sits on either ends of the burger. \n<br />In between those 2 are your thick juicy beef patty, bacon, caramelised onions, arugula &amp; more cheese. \n<br />Well, I don\'t have to say much, but I\'m sure you can already imagine how insanely good this burger is. \n<br />Before you start drooling, do note that this burger is available for a limited time only! They\'re available till the 30th of November, so you\'ve got about 1.5 months to indulge &amp; walk them off by walking home. •\n<br />• \n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG
So, went to a place that had both! 😆Gotta LURVE their burgers, awesome juicy medium patty - it\'s a messy burger to eat, but oh-so-YUMz. The Number 2 - my go-to feel good burger for now.

Love how assuming she looks but packs a ton of flavour! Juicy beef patty, toasted tomatoes, burrata, crispy prosciutto and pesto. •\n<br />•\n<br />Call me chicken, but I prefer the burrata over the crescenza 😜 The creamier, softer and milder flavours of the burrata left me wanting more...

🍔 Ground Sirloin Patty (Medium-Rare)\n<br />🍔 Portobello Mushrooms\n<br />🍔 Canadian Back Bacon\n<br />🍔 Prelibato Gorgonzola (Blue-Veined 🧀)\n<br />🍔 Blue Cheese Sauce
come try it for yourself but be quick cos it\'s only available till end of August!
With bold XO sauce and kaffir lime mayo, it was shouting local flavours on a juicy turkey patty burger.
How was it? Absolutely satisfying.
Might not be the hours for a meal but definitely good to beat the heat in a hot afternoon.
🍟\n<br />•\n<br />Their Onion Ring are the way to go, not those crap sh*t from the freezer but upon ordering one noticed that they use Fresh Onions fried in a Light &amp; Thin Batter. Curly Fries reminiscent of the Clown, I\'d say skip it. Don\'t even get me started if you should order the Truffle French Fries. 🖕🏻\n<br />All Sides are priced at 💵S$5 except for... Yes you guessed it the Truffle French Fries at 💵S$6.\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: But however, you can get a 1 for 1 FREE on the Sides, Beer (250ml) &amp; cocktails (from S$14) if you come during their \"Happy Hour\" from 3pm-7pm.

It was tasty
Out of the 5 burger options available (4 meat &amp; 1 vegetarian option), I went for the second in line - Number Two. \n<br />Sandwiched between two thick &amp; fluffy buns were a slab of juicy Beef Patty, a huge roasted tomato, a surprise center filled with burrata topped with crispy prosciutto &amp; pesto sauce. \n<br />Upon first look, the burger looked much like a typical burger except that the patty was possibly twice or thrice the size of a usual patty. But after cutting it down right through the middle, the melted burrata oozed out like the fountain of wealth, with overflowing cheesy goodness (which I\'d regret later but will always find it worth it). Pair this with their draft beers (always choose Blanc if not Asahi) &amp; you\'ve settled in for dinner. \n<br />If you guys didn\'t already know, Burpple is now having a burger party giveaway 🎉 here are the steps that you gotta take to win this party for 10 pax! • Snap a photo of your FAV burger &amp; #BurppleBurgerMonth\n<br />• Then tag 9 of your buddies who will be indulging with you • &amp; then you wait patiently till the 2nd of June to announce winners! •\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG
Beef patty is most succulent and very flavourful.
