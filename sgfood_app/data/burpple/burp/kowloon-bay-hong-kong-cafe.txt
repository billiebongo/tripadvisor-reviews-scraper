Very sweet sauce over Char Siew, both BBQ meats are extra soft to taste.
Sauce over the beehoon is little smoky taste. The Pork Belly is roasted then braised. Thick slice too. $12.90 for now.
One of the slow cooked Porridge. The century egg is well cooked and soft.
Newly opened Hillion Mall (connected to Bukit Panjang MRT Station) is giving Bukit Panjang Plaza a run for their money. There are so many popular food chains here (Dian Xiao Er, Danro, Ssikkek Korean BBQ and even TUK TUK CHA!!!!!!) as well as new openings like this buzzy Kowloon Bay HK Cafe. 
From Kowloon Bay Hong Kong Cafe at Hillion Mall; both the mall and restaurant officially opens today to much fanfare of Bukit Panjang residents ‚Äî it is situated at Bukit Panjang MRT/LRT Station with the bus interchange moving in at a later date.
Wasn\'t quite ready to down an entire main myself since I was going to have dinner at home, so went for the Butter Polo Bun which was not too bad. The crust atop was pretty buttery, but it seemed to have lacked a little crispness and felt a little close to being \"yet another bread\" in terms of texture. Otherwise, the bun\'s pretty fluffy and comes with a knob of butter in between that\'s in the midst of melting as it gets all warmed up in between the buns.
The glistening burnt edges of the charsiew was as superb as they looked. The sio bak was pretty good as well though the skin could have been crispier. Get their bowls of noodle to enjoy the meat with!\n<br />*\n<br />Thanks @kowloonbayhkcafe_sg for the hospitality and @burpple for extending the invite :)\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #noodle #food #meat #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat
It taste just nice, the chasiew has a nice honey aftertaste and not too fatty, the wanton also nice but not so impressive.\n<br />We thought on that price they could be more generous with the noodle\'s size. Bcoz it is very small like thai boat noodle (only about 2 mouthfuls).\n<br />üí∞$9.9\n<br />üöù MRT/LRT Bukit Panjang\n<br />üìç#01-07 Hillion Mall, 17 Petir Road 678278 Singapore\n<br />‚è±10AM-10PM\n<br />Rate (3/5) ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è -GOOD-\n<br />#kowloonbay #wantonnoodle #wontonsoup #wontonnoodle #chasiew #chasio #pork #porknoodle #porklover #porkporn #singaporeculinary #nomnom #nomnomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #burpple #sgfoddies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgig
\'Hok Kee Rice with Soup\'\n<br />Hainan Rice with Roasted Pork, Chasiew, tofu, half egg, and corn carrot soup.\n<br />The star in the dish is the roasted pork. It\'s high quality and satisfying because the proportion between the fat and the meat is perfect (not too fatty and not too thin).\n<br />The chasiew also have a good sweet taste.\n<br />The clear soup is also nice.\n<br />But this will not be our daily place to go because it\'s very pricey.\n<br />üí∞$13.9\n<br />üöù MRT/LRT Bukit Panjang\n<br />üìç#01-07 Hillion Mall, 17 Petir Road 678278 Singapore\n<br />‚è±10AM-10PM\n<br />Rate (4/5) ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è -VERY GOOD-\n<br />#chasiew #roastedpork #porkbelly #hainanese #hongkongrestaurant #singapore #singaporefood #singaporeeats #singaporelife #singaporefoodie #singaporeculinary #nomnom #nomnomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #burpple #sgfoddies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgig

Taste terrible and looks terrible.
Pot of rose tea. Fragrant simply.
I\'m always on the lookout for solid HK milk tea in Singapore and this ranks pretty high on my list! Sock-pulled, super gao but not overly sweet milk tea served in a bottle that is stashed in a bucket of ice. Gimmicky as it looks, the ice keeps the drink chilled but not watered down ‚Äî just the way I like it to be! #Burpproved
