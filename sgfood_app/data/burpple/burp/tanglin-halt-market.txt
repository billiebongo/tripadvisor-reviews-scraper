We tried smurfs, earl grey and seasalt caramel.... Alll are so affordable and nice. And its homemade and sooooo nice. Did i say that already? Ahahaha
Generous portion and ingredients! Super long q for this, very tasty
The soft carrot cake chunks comes covered in loads of thick black sauce which makes it taste so sinful yet so good!
This stall decides to forgo on the Pork Lard, so that ain\'t much crispiness to be had in the bowl which is pretty disappointing. Despite so, their fishballs are bouncy and the noodles springy, and tossed in a sauce which is heavy in vinegar just for that tang.
Supper after choir practice. Old School Wanton noodles. How many of u are still awake &amp; hungry?!
Having prawn noodles on a rainy sat morning. I am feeling so lazy today!
Having a good breakfast on a working day. But, I\'m not working today!! :)
Cheap and good laksa from Tanglin Halt market. Chicken, prawns, cockles and tau pok... Only $4!!!
Bee Hoon, sunny side up egg, luncheon meat (how do I resist!?), Ngoh Hiang + cabbage = only S$2.60!! Happy belly, happy tastebuds. Love it that lady boss is so smiley üòä\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#happyweekend #happybelly #happythoughts #beehoon #breakfast #brekkie #luncheonmeat #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfooddiary #sgfoodpic #sgfoodporn #foodtography #foodstagram #foodporn #happybrekkie #tanglinhalt #tanglinhaltmarket #meijia #meijiafriedbeehoon #meijiabeehoon #kosyeats #kosyeatssg #burpplesg #burpple
Didn\'t feel like shake so eat this instead. Century Egg Pork Porridge ($2.30) is not bad for its price, with finely diced century egg and easily 4-5 minced pork balls. The Char Siew Cheong Fun ($2.50) is not bad too, love the filling which has veg and char siew. The chilli sauce is a must to go with it.

However, the rice was a letdown as it tasted less fragrant and tasty, which didn\'t help even with the black soy sauce added.
