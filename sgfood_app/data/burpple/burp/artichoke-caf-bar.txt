Not what I expected for brunch, but the Fried Chicken ($24) came w 3 massive pieces of drumlet/wings!!! Meat was so moist that the honey-lemon glazed batter kept sliding off the juicy meat. Loved the light toum (garlic whip/dip) that tasted so good w everything (fries, chicken, pita). Order this to share if you\'re not a big eater!
After hearing me constantly rave over Artichoke, my sister had high hopes coming here with me to eat. (She\'s the pickiest eater.) And trust me, she didn\'t even bother talking to me throughout lunch, because she was too busy eating her food. What amazes me always is how Artichoke takes such simple vegetables like this cauliflower, and completely transforms it to a whole new level of yum and satisfying. It makes you eat vegetables without thinking you\'re eating vegetables - you feel me? And they balance the flavours so well, that you will happily mop up everything (with their delicious pita bread) and luxuriate in every final bite. I swear - if my parents had brought me here when I was five, I think I\'d actually enjoy eating vegetables. Typing this has made me hungry again. Help. üòÇ
Don\'t ask me how to pronounce this - I am clueless myself. Being a huge eggplant lover, my sister was a happy camper with this dish. Their chargrilled eggplant didn\'t turn bitter despite the grilling, remaining moist on the inside, and went perfectly with their sauce, mushrooms, caramelised onions and haloumi. It\'s like a vegetarian steak, but with a completely new texture that just makes you keep wanting more of everything. The sister highly approves! üòèüëçüèª
Soft serve creations by Artichoke\'s Group Pastry Chef (and Burpple Tastemaker) @fionating never fail to please me with their imaginative yet thoughtfully curated flavours and textures.\n<br />The one I had at tonight\'s \"Flavours of the Philippines\" event featured a taro (yam) flavour soft serve. It came accessorised with familiar Pinoy ingredients of fresh jackfruit, crunchy Boy Bawang puffed corn, a fried banana springroll and a shower of desiccated coconut. I couldn\'t ask for a better sweet ending to my Filipino feast. And if you look closely at my pic, you\'ll notice Artichoke\'s Chef-Owner Bjorn Shen is as keen on my taro soft serve as I! üòÜ
Another favourite dish of ours at tonight\'s \"Flavours of the Philippines\" pop-up event was the Lechon Manok ($16).\n<br />Beautifully moist, it had a delicate fragrance from having been massaged with a lemongrass rub prior to cooking. Served alongside were housemade atchara pickles and coconut vinegar for the vital acidic cut through.\n<br />Let\'s just say we did an excellent job of making everything disappear in no time üòãüòãüòã
The night belonged to \"Pinoy Dude Food\" and it was done bloody well! Basically,  Chef Frankie Le, the mastermind behind this event and the team, took an array of Filipino classics and gave it the Artichoke spin. His 3-week trip to the Philippines was obviously a great source of inspiration.\n<br />We loved everything we had but my favourites were the Kinilaw ($12), Sisig Hotcakes ($14) and the Lechon Manok ($16). The former two, shown above, burst with such mouthwatering flavours.\n<br />Kinilaw is essentially a Pinoy version of the ceviche and this version had cubes of red snapper fish tossed in vinegar along with strips of capsicum, jalape√±os and topped with extremely crispy chicken skin. Very appetising stuff.\n<br />The Sisig Hotcake ($14) had all the best parts of a pig (cheek, ear, liver, collar) chopped up and saut√©ed, then piled onto a maple syrup hot cake and topped with a fried egg and crispy chicharon (deep-fried puffs of pig rind). This sweet and savoury combo was so delicious we had to order a second round of it.
A luscious soft serve that boasts an intense maple flavour. Went super well with the tart gooseberry compote and the floral rose jelly! Found the biscuit base to be a little hard but still very very enjoyable dessert that you can\'t stop shoveling. Loved the sprinkled sumac.
Absolutely amazing. I\'m not usually a sweet tooth, but I\'m impressed. The soft served freeze and the maple flavors combine to refresh you instantly. Not to mention the rose jelly the serves as a comforting end to each mouthful of ice cream. A must try.
Just gamey enough to please the lamb-lover yet still pleasing to those who don\'t usually like lamb, this dish was a winner at dinner. The meat is so incredibly soft, and you can just taste the slowwwww cook, the closest you\'ll get to tasting time. If that makes any sense.
Enjoyed how well the generous portions of pulled duck went with the kale, walnuts and pappardelle. This dish is definitely good on its own, but pales in comparison when you have it together with the prawns and lamb shoulder, like a NCAA star entering the major league.
Maple soft serve with rose jelly and fresh gooseberry compote! It is sooo good üòª
harissa paste, tiger prawns, blue mussels, red snapper, shaved fennel, sweet corn, clam shell pasta, fermented butter
Graham cracker tart shell, Gooseberry filling with a tad of floral rose water, fat dollop of Maple Mascarpone and a dash of Sumac. It\'s a heavenly floral-sour-sweet combination that @coffeevicinity and I are proud of. \n<br />This beauty will be ready for the taking alongside other @artichoke_sg\'s grub from tomorrow via UberEATS. Lunch time only. Best be ready. \n<br />#FTrecommends #artichokesg
the warm, comforting, soft Comte gougere (savory choux) with a great crust, served with a perfect quenelle of super smooth foie gras butter (YES YOU HEARD IT - FOIE GRAS BUTTER) and a caraway spiced rhubarb compote, a lovely spiced, sweet jam to break all the OHSORICH goodness of the cheese and foie. I could eat copious amounts of these... #burpple #artichokesg
Maple glazed bacon chop FTW. wouldn\'t have it any other way. #artichokesg #burpple
Ended with the #artichokesg Chocolate Br√ªl√©e - the oh-so-satisfying br√ªl√©e crack atop a ultra smooth tahini chocolate pudding, the richness of the chocolate broken by mandarin curd and orange jello, and some creme fraiche to tie it all together. Chocolate has never been my first choice but I could not stop scraping the leftover pudding off the uneven surface of the bowl to clean it all up. Some mighty fine desserts we are seeing at @artichoke_sg and @birdbirdsg now! #burpple #artichokesg
The quivering mound of Yoghurt Muhallebi triggered fond memories of when I first encountered tofu cheesecake. Except that this was even softer because it\'s basically a lusciously creamy pudding. Furthermore, with exotic toppings that include pecan nuts, it\'s also far more titillating to the tastebuds. Yet it\'s apparent how much care has gone into ensuring each component is impeccably harmonised with another, so as to achieve an ambrosial equilibrium. Personally, I was amazed by how perfect a foil the salty, crispy wisps of brown butter kataifi was to the gently sweet orange blossom honey and poached apricots.\n<br />Even if you are stuffed to the gills and are ready to wave that little white flag, I recommend the only thing you surrender to is an order of this. Trust me - it\'s worth it.
I am loving the new direction of Artichoke\'s dinner menu. With the restructuring, there is now a selection of \"Small\" plates, with portion sizes sitting somewhere between that of their mezzes and their \"Large\" plates. I say YAY to that because it means having more chances to dig into a wider variety! ü§ó\n<br />Shown above is the juicy Pan-roasted Cabbage Shoots and French Beans, a dish to be launched next week under this section. Thanks to an aromatic saffron butter sauce, perky capers and sharply-hot pickled garlic, this is one fiercely flavourful plate of veggies. The kind that can wrestle any meat to the ground.
The bad lighting at the outdoor seats doesn\'t do the dish any justice. The slow roasted lamb shoulder was super tender and flavourful! Same goes to the beef w a slightly char and crisp exterior. Which went very well with the green harissa dip.
We got the Ah Bang\'s Special ($25), Trudy\'s Bigger Pita Pockets ($24), Jolene\'s Crabby Buns ($26), Jaslyn\'s Pop &amp; Toast ($23) &amp; Gordon\'s Sunny \"Chez\" Sandwich ($26)! My personal favorites were Ah Bang\'s Special &amp; Jaslyn\'s Pop &amp; Toast! Ah Bang\'s Special was something that I\'d have any day, somewhat like a comfort food kinda dish. As for Jaslyn\'s Pop &amp; Toast, it\'s definitely the sweet treat that you\'d need to brighten up your weekend!
For Artichoke Young Guns, happening only this weekend, you\'d be seeing the young chefs working it out in the kitchen &amp; trying out the special items! 
Stormed into Artichoke today to get our hands on the creations by their Young Guns as they take over the brunch menu THIS WEEKEND ONLY (30th &amp; 31st July)!!\n<br />It took us a while to decide on what to get as everything looked incredibly tempting, but we eventually picked \"Ah Bang\'s Special\" and \"Jolene\'s Crabby Buns\".\n<br />If you want something light, the former (pictured above) is perfect. It\'s a seafood-centric broth with little neck clams, crispy Japanese river shrimps, lamb merguez sausage slices, pearl couscous, some green harissa and a perfectly poached egg.\n
Artichoke\'s Young Guns take over the brunch menu this weekend (30th and 31st July) and not surprisingly, they are totally bringing it! üôå\n<br />Because everything looked intriguingly delicious, it took some deliberation before we picked \"Ah Bang\'s Special\" and \"Jolene\'s Crabby Buns\".\n<br />If you are the sort who like something fierce, I suggest going for the latter. There\'s a huge and fleshy deepfried softshell crab (coated with Doritos no less) threatening to escape from between those buns, aided by red harissa tuna pate, loads of zingy lime toum and zhoug. I adore the crisp pickles tucked in there especially, as they add the essential cut-through that makes the robust burger work really well. 
.\n<br />|\n<br />One last post for from our last Saturday brunch. Maple glazed in house smoked bacon. Need I explain more??? üòãüòãüòã
|\n<br />Ultimate comfort food (best for hangover üòÅ). Shredded slow roasted lamb, tomato sauce and finished with baked egg on top. .\n<br />|\n<br />Broke off the pita bread and dig in. Very good for sharing. .\n<br />|\n<br />Maybe I can try cooking it. üòÅüòÅüòÅ
|\n<br />If there is some food which I couldn\'t have enough of, it will be this fried chicken. Juicy chicken wrapped with crispy batter and glazed with honey lemon. The hashed brown was little over salted but overall it was still good! .\n<br />|\n<br />Changed between coleslaw and fried chicken helped to refreshed up the taste. üòçüòçüòç\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Side note: must eat with their sauce!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
|\n<br />Very messy but super delicious. Well balanced dish by the burrata and basil sauce. While the palate was enjoying the milky creamy cheese, a pop of sweetness by the  pomegranate surprised the tongue. .\n<br />|\n<br />Just by thinking of this dish, my Monday blue was been chased away.
|\n<br />The tastiest cauliflower dish ever! Instead of the cauliflower being the side, it became the center piece. Roasted in oven and coasted with a blend of spices. .\n<br />|\n<br />I gave up on figuring out what\'s in the dish but focused enjoying its complex taste.
|\n<br />After visited Artichoke for so many times, this is my first time posting its brunch. .\n<br />|\n<br />Toasted Turkish Bread with mashed avocado. Topped with pan fried mushroom and feta cheese. .\n<br />|\n<br />Local inspired ingredients and 100% vegetarian. Who need meat when we can eat this!!!! üòãüòãüòã\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />* Do note that it came with more rockets
Fried Cauliflower, Smoked Egg, Hummus, Labneh, Israeli Salad, Truffled Tahini, Coriander Zhuong, Herbs, Pita. I love it when people attempt to grill my vegetables, and the cauliflowers were on point with the crisp florets and slightly charred and salted flavours. Elsewhere in the dish, it\'s a complex marriage of different taste profiles that seemingly work well with one another, giving little surprises with each bite as everything is scattered all over the pita bread. One moment you get a little coolness from the mint, another moment a hint of truffle and the next the green-ish taste of coriander ‚Äî one thing for sure though is how the Sabbich felt predominantly middle-eastern in its flavour profile especially with the well-executed hummus. A rather adventurous item in nature from how it sounds, but it\'s definitely satisfying and bound to hit the tastebuds of most.
I wouldn\'t really call these the best fried chicken I have ever had, but they belong to the better few fried chicken I have ever had nonetheless. The fried batter was crisp and thick, while locking in the juices of the chicken well with the flesh being succulent. The honey-glazing work well, giving the fried chicken a little sweet-savoury flavour combination that\'s pretty satisfying. What I enjoyed a lot was the paprika hashed browns ‚Äî a little salty for some but totally hits on my palate; totally into dipping these little hash browns into the garlic dip that\'s all punchy and very strong in flavour it\'s almost akin to eating garlic with a creamier touch. Trust me; if you are who loves heavy flavours and garlic, then you would probably end up dipping every single thing into the garlic dip; truly addictive!
I got a little afraid of Burrata dishes ever since my encounter with the giant blob of cheese I have had at Lollapalooza which saw a combination of two portions into one plate with an intimidating ball of cheese ‚Äî the fact that the Feta Burrata comes served with creamy cheese comforts me for its less scary to look at. The same Turkish Toast from the Haloumi Mushrooms appear here, which was perfection for that texture where you get that satisfying pulling sensation when you cut it apart, yet not too dense with a delightfully light crust. Again, the cheese here feels light ‚Äî it\'s never too jelat for a cheese-based item and immensely smooth while elements such as the passionfruit just cuts it just right with a little bit of zing that goes on in there. Very very smart indeed.
A while ago, a friend of mine visited Artichoke for the first time and said he loved the Lamb Shakshouka there. The result from having two eggs in a skillet with spiced tomato sauce, slow-cooked lamb shoulder, green chili harissa, kewpie yogurt and pita, this is probably the best Shakshouka you are looking at in town. I like how everything similar seemed to have been done from scratch especially for the spiced tomato sauce which was a good balance of sweet-sour flavours without that \"bleh\" aftertaste that usually comes with canned pur√©e, which went well with the slight gaminess of the pulled lamb shoulder that went into it. Dip the Pita into the Shakshouka, and the bread was able to absorb the flavours all so beautifully without getting soggy, maintaining its fluffiness without being all too doughy. It may sound exaggerating, but it felt like I am done with my hunt on finding a good Shakshouka around the island right after having the one served here.
Smashed avocado, mushrooms, tomato salad, rocket, Turkish toast. A dish that answered my love to plump mushrooms that\'s served in chunky bits that simply adds on a qq-texture to the dish. When warm, the Haloumi is said to be soft but I still quite enjoyed it\'s slightly drier form after some intense photo taking as well as the light cheesiness that runs with it. The Turkish toast was delightful ‚Äî lightly crusted with a nice tension as you slice the toast apart, yet achieving the perfect texture without being too dense; a true winner especially when spread with all that smashed avocado for that buttery flavour.
If one is having brunch at Artichoke with a predominantly carnivorous crowd, never ever miss this dish. Available as an extra, it\'s a slab of thickly sliced meat that carries a ham-like texture and flavour glazed in maple syrup ‚Äî perfect ratio of saltiness to sweetness. It\'s not part of any main, but I would go to say that it\'s just as, or even more satisfying than any main especially if you are a meat-lover!
One of my favourite dishes here at Artichoke. One mouthful is a full of different levels of texture and tastes, from crunchiness of the almonds &amp; brussel sprouts to the sweetness of pomegranate pips.
Shatteringly crunchy fried chicken that\'s good on their own but became simply unbelievable with the accompanying garlic toum and green harissa. Also tucked in the pan were slaw and pickled vegetable sticks that helped to balance out the experience of eating this dish with a refreshing crispness.
You have to order this juicy bacon on the side! Definitely worth the try! 
Not a lamb person, but this js good. Spices and combination of sauces does blend well with the lamb. Will come back for more! 
This is so good and light. Loving the combinations of cheese-onions and the bread is good as well
Although I am very picky on lamb dishes, their slow stewed lamb didn\'t let me downüëè
I love me a good burrata. Coupled with the reviews on Burpple I knew I had to order this. ü§î
Saturday brunch at Artichoke cafe with the family. \n<br />A nice change from the typical sort of brunch fare like eggs benedict/french toast etc. Ordered the Haloumi &amp; Mushrooms ($22), Cauliflower Sabbich ($22) and burpple-recommended dish Lamb Shakshoka ($26). Expect generous portions, lots of rich flavours and lots of dairy-based sauces (yoghurt, cheese). My favourite was definitely the Cauliflower Sabbich: Smokey fried cauliflower, sweet pickled capsicum, grilled cherry tomatoes and cucumber, wild rocket on top of pita bread smothered with a yoghurt based sauce. A vegetarian dish but there\'s no compromise on its flavours. Can foresee myself coming back over and over üëçüèª‚ò∫Ô∏è We arrived at 1130am, exactly when the cafe opens for weekend brunch to see that there was already a small queue forming, so reservation is advised!
Been meaning to try Artichoke since its been trending on Burple and I was not disappointed. This is one of the best eggs shakshuka I\'ve had and I cook this dish regularly at home too. Tomato sauce was thick, rich, aromatic and well spiced with generous chunks of tender lamb shoulder. Topped with perfectly baked eggs with runny yolks and warm pita bread. I wanted to steal the recipe, it was that good!! Overall a standout menu and great ambience although slightly more pricey (~ $30 p/person), it\'s money well spent for the quality of food, generous portions, nice relaxed setting and good service. Good for brunch with friends. They also have large tables you can book for big groups too. Will return!
; doncha wish your matcha was cool like me
\nWhether it\'s dinner for two or ten, my ritual at Artichoke is to start with a selection of their mezzes. They have an interesting repertoire that\'s a mix of Middle Eastern classics (some with a twist) and a couple that I can\'t place geographically but taste so darn good who cares! Below are the ones I had on a recent visit... 
\nImagine a vey privileged chicken who has done nought except to lounge around and smoke its life away on the most expensive cigars. That\'s what went through my mind when I chomped on the Smoked Chicken because its moist meat was thoroughly infused with the most fragrant smokiness. Best way to eat this is with your fingers. Rip off a chunk of the juicy chicken, swish it good in that toum garlic whip, and shove it in your mouth. Repeat.
The date pudding was taken off the menu a while back and I have missed it ever since. Fortunately, a small batch was produced for an event and a big thank you to @fionatingx for letting us have some of it!
Restored in all its former golden glory üññüèª [these little puds of joy were revived specially for a private event. limited portions available from next week till we sell out.] #artichokesg
If you are nursing a hangover from partying too hard on a Friday or Saturday, this pan of Huevos Rancheros should help \"nurse you back to health\" in no time at all üòÑ . It\'s filled with a hefty serving of ful medames (stodgy-in-a-tasty-way fava beans that\'re well-seasoned and a bit mushy), two large and crunchy lamb merguez sausages, some smashed avocado, a fried egg, baby tomatoes and a few pieces of crispy hash browns. There\'s a few jalape√±os thrown in to enliven things further. The best way to eat this is to load your fork/spoon with a bit of everything (that is, assuming your hangover allows you to be adequately coordinated üòÅ ) and shove it in your mouth. 
It looks dry from all the pictures but it\'s actually pretty juicy! Super crunchy on the outside! Serve with paprika harsh brown. Pickles and tahini colelaw. The dip is so awesome that my dear friend wipe it out! Lol!
I love pancakes. This is probably one of the most interesting one and yet pretty tasty as well. You have the pancake at the bottom as the first layer and with some lettuce pieces. Follow by egg mayo at the next layer! Smoked salmon on it. With a spoonful of Jim beam sour cream. And sprinkled with some wasabi green peas dukkah. Garnish with some sliced onions and radish. Drizzle with orange blossom honey. Very interestingly pleasure!
Baked eggs with slow cooked lamb shoulder in spiced tomato sauce. I love baked eggs! Takes a skillful chef to do this correctly! From the top, the eggs looks cooked, but it should still be runny inside! Let\'s a trick in doing this, I guess it comes with practice! I\'ve cooking it for 5 years.. I wonder how many eggs I ever touched so far.. I believe more than 10,000 eggs. Back to the topic, like the way they cooked the lamb, not strong taste of the lamb! *claps*
I loved the intense flavors of the wild mushrooms and the grilled crust of the haloumi. What a great way to start the day. This makes you feel like you\'ve enjoyed a 4-0 win with a Ronaldo hat trick. #burpple  #lovesportslovefood #selfbetatestingnewsports-foodratingsystem
Neither do they give a shit about your own special request and stuff and stuff. Hahaha! Yeap that\'s the culture in Artichoke, they not entertain your request for sunny side up, egg white only scramble or whatever so ever. It was stated clearly in the menu. For this, I actually love them for that. Cause for every chef, we do get a lot of bullshit requests from customers all the time. For that I love the stand that Artichoke have! They can\'t modify the food according to your request. They can advise you what you can order and what you can\'t order based on what you\'re allergic on. And I wanna emphasized: not on your preferences. Sometimes chef needs to make a stand in the food they serve. Like how an egg Ben is served with poached eggs and why not scramble eggs? There is a reason behind it. Chef\'s creations, every ingredients serve a purpose in 1 dish. They don\'t happen to be there by chance!
And even highlighted Pure Blonde\'s ultra low carb lager to me! HAHAHAHA! I might just found something to satisfy my love for beer and being more healthy at the same time. Tell me that it\'s possible!
Super awesome mash of chickpeas base with home made lamb sausage, guac, hash brown and tomatoes. $26++
Think Korean honey pancake topped with egg mayo, and thick smoke salmon. What you have, would be a plate of beautiful flavours, perfect for a lazy wake-me-up Saturday! Hints of wasabi peas could be tasted, hints of sour cream that goes well with the egg mayo, that laid generously on top of fresh crisp greens. And those smoked salmon, thick and generous that no one would complain. But honestly the star would be that thick pancake, so similar to the street Korean pancakes that I adore. Dense, not fluffy, but oh-so-yummy. 
ohmygasm this was an explosion of flavours which absolutely worked. Fried brussel sprouts, pickled roasted red onions topped off with labneh ranch (yogurt like dressing) and a perfect balance between savoury and this sweet taste of the dish, I really loved it. I think I really enjoy Mediterranean food. üëçüèª My friend ordered the \'Samke Harra\' which explains why it\'s in the picture as well hahaha
The atmosphere, location and music choice are the pulling factors to this quaint, hidden Gem in Bugis. Although the experience was overall pleasant I feel it was let down in other areas such as the service and price.\n<br />The Menu: I was definitely more enticed to order the Mezze dishes, perhaps because I‚Äôm a sucker for share plates or the choice was more varied, we ordered the Burrata, asparagus and figs. They were also surprisingly filling despite its small quantity.\n<br />In the mains section we ordered the salmon and the Squid, both very delicious. The crispy skin on the salmon melted in the mouth and the squid had a fantastic smoky taste.\n<br />Given the price which I would say is fair for the quality of the dish, the service was not to match. We were never approached by a server and struggled to get the attention of staff when we required it.  The seating arrangement was also not ideal as the Bench had no support to lean against and the cushions provided were somewhat impractical to sit on or lean on.\n<br />To say the evening ended on a sour note had nothing to do with being kicked out at 11pm but more to do with the complimentary sweets I received for the walk home. I thought this was a very nice touch and one I will remember.
There used to be an item on the brunch menu that featured this thick slab of divine maple-glazed bacon chop with eggs and some greens. While that dish is no longer available from the current selection, you can still get this as an add-on for $10 and you really, REALLY should. It\'s like a well-smoked bacon and Christmas ham\'s love child and remains undefeated as my favourite here (tied at first place with the feta burrata, of course). ‚ù§Ô∏è
Totally fell in love with this dish. The dip of avocado sauce and yogurt gave the extra creaminess to the dish. For those who can\'t stand the lamb smell, this will be a good start.
They dressed the prawn with fried onion and coriander which might misled it to be a Chinese dish. However the green chilli based sauce made it so exotic. The spicy didn\'t overpowered the sweetness of the prawn but seasoned it perfectly. Remember to squeeze the lemon, it will made the sauce ten times better. Dipped it with the pita bread, you will understand why this dish worth 36 dollars.
Good and cozy ambience and highly recommended for small group gathering. \n<br />Our first dish - Hummus. Mushed chickpea then seasoned with tahini, sumac and paprika. Break the warm pita and take a small scoop of the chickpea. It\'s nutty and earthy flavors created comfort in the mouth. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
Feta &amp; Burrata: fluffy toasted Turkish bread, creamy burrata, sweet pickled onions, and little pomegranate rubies. It\'s light, tangy, and refreshing - a great way to start the meal.
A long time favourite on Artichoke\'s weekend brunch menu, the Lamb Shakshouka ($26) is the perfect union of tender lamb shoulder and spot-on runny eggs. Served in a skillet, this Middle Eastern inspired dish is enlivened by a well-balanced spiced tomato sauce and a stunning green chilli harissa. Tear off pieces of the accompanying pita bread and use that to mop up that delicious mess. Don\'t worry ‚Äî the guys at Artichoke are too laidback to judge. Pro tip: The dish is super filling, so you might also want to order a lighter main (try the Haloumi &amp; Mushrooms, $22) and share both with a friend.
Definitely lived up to its reputation. I\'ve heard so much about @artichoke_sg\'s shakshuka, and now that I\'ve had it I\'m adding on to the sea of positive reviews. Lots of moist braised lamb, perfectly runny eggs, stunning green chili harissa. I especially like how the savoury components and creamy sauces tempered the acidic tomatoes, so the resulting dish would please most people - even those who aren\'t fans of tomato-based stews!
Here\'s the Halloumi and Mushrooms: saut√©ed huge oyster mushrooms, grilled halloumi, tangy tomato salad, creamy avocado, and fluffy toasted Turkish bread. Delish beyond words.
Artichoke\'s Huevos Rancheros, essentially the Mexican\'s full breakfast, comes chock full of flavours. The simplest hash browns, for example, were flawless: crushing them allowed certain parts to crisp up while others remained waxy and moist. Loooove the piquant lamb merguez sausages and ful medames too!
Those 4 huge prawns sitting on top of the absolutely divine green chilli sauce just got me all hot and bothered. The prawns are so fresh, that they are crunchy to bite. You know how prawns are mushy when they are not fresh! And that green chilli harissa sauce just brought the prawns to a whole new dimension. Creamy, and a hint of spice, it tasted somewhat like Thai green curry, only a lot lighter but with whole lot of flavour. Those caramelised fried opinions, add a touch of sweetness to the dish. On a whole, this hot skillet is like a Love song, making me fall in love all over. 
Slow roasted lamb shoulder ($36), that so tender, and soft that it just falls apart literally. Personally felt that the meat is seasoned right, that there isn\'t that strong lamb smell. Although some sensitive few beg to differ. (Trust me on this, especially when I was in Turkey trying authentic lamb dishes). A hint of spice and sweetened by the tomatoes and \"dirty\" onions. A tad (just a tiny bit) salty, so it goes great with pita bread. Or else if you are big on strong seasoning, this dish is balanced! üëçüèª
Generous portion of smoked salmon on a thick pancake, accompanied with shaved onions, orange blossom honey and wasabi peas.
.\n<br />Generous amount of smoked salmon sitting smack on a pancake with egg mayo and sour cream. Plus the addition of wasabi peas also provides a refreshing take to usual pancakes.\n<br />.\n<br />The proportion of salmon to pancake is surprisingly 2:1, making it perceived to be more worthwhile and I would gladly pay for that amount.
The bold flavours and charming courtyard space of Artichoke are best enjoyed with a best friend, the kind of person who won\'t judge when you make inappropriate noises at dinner. Both the relaxed atmosphere and honest food demand that you leave all etiquette at the door ‚Äî you\'re gonna get your hands and face a little dirty. Start your food adventure by ordering warm pita bread to dip into tasty mezzes like Babaganoush ($8) and Beetroot Tzatziki ($8), these make for a fine introduction to the flavours of the Middle East that inspire the food here. Next, let the creamy Feta \"Burrata\" ($22) seduce you, before you assault your tastebuds with the piquant green harissa sauce of the Hot Skillet Prawns ($36). Don\'t be shy, suck on those prawn heads! Pick from either the Chargrilled Pork Belly ($28) or the intensely smoky Smoked Chicken ($30) to finish up, should you still have the space. For those who must end on a sweet note, share either a Rocky Road or Mango Sticky Rice Neh Neh Pop ($7-8).
Strawberry Pokie ($7). Strawberry ripple ice cream coated with white chocolate and strawberry pocky. 
Tender slow roasted lamb shoulder which went really well with their pita :)
Fried cauliflower, smoked egg, hummus, labneh, Israeli salad, truffled tahini, herbs, pita üòäüòä
$22. I really liked this, though I wished the pita had been toasted and the cauliflower crunchier. I did like the hummus and the tang of the Israeli salad though. Smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk (Y)
Burppled about this before but I need to do it again for all of mankind\'s sake. Please do yourself a favour and try this dish at Artichoke least once in your life. As with the rest of the menu here, it is recommended for sharing but with those gigantic fresh prawns cooked in Head Chef Jonathan Lee\'s kickass green chilli harissa and cream gravy, I find it So. Damn. Hard.
yoooOoOoOo it\'s mango sticky rice in a popsicle!!!! the white chocolate coating is as good as it looks! loaded with cereal and other crunchy thingamajigs this is like a premium version of the most premium magnum üëçüèø the actual popsicle was actually slightly disappointing for me and I thought it wasn\'t worth the 7$ because it was too icy BUT it had a little bit of glutinous rice and generous chunks of mango which made it way better ;-) mmm very creative nehnehpop you KINDDA make me wanna come back and get the other flavors hmmm ;-)
HALOUMI. Enough said. Couldn\'t wrap our heads around the savoury+sweet mix of smoked salmon and pancakes though.
Locally grown mushrooms with pan fried oh so yummy haloumi. I never used to order this because I thought to myself \'how exciting can mushrooms and cheese be?\' Let\'s just say I was proven to be very wrong.
Artichoke is where you want to go if the group feels like trying something new. Expect punchy flavours and getting your hands dirty. Start off with a few mezzes like Babaganoush ($8), and Beetroot Tzatziki ($8), and be sure to order warm, fresh-from-the-oven pita bread to go along. Not to be missed is the Feta \"Burrata\" ($22) ‚Äî a creamy, irresistable dish perfect for sharing. Must-orders include the Hot Skillet Prawns ($36) ‚Äî massive prawns bathing in a creamy, piquant green harissa sauce, and finished with fried onions ‚Äî and the Slow Roasted Lamb Shoulder ($36), rich and exceedingly succulent, it\'s sure to please carnivores. Your meal doesn\'t have to end here, round it off with their tongue-in-cheek Neh Neh Pop creamsicles ($7-8)! Be sure to make reservations.
Thick slices of maple glazed bacon chops, with roasted pumpkin, a poached egg and dusted with pistachio dukka. It is my personal opinion that scrambled eggs would complete this dish much better than a poached egg - I tried that combination once because they ran out of poached eggs for the day so I speak from experience. Go get your fix this weekend at @artichoke_sg!
That green chilli harissa with huge big prawns will make you go crazy. Other than the Sultan\'s Delight which is no longer on the menu, this has got to be my favorite dish on the dinner menu. \n<br />#artichokesg #burrple
This fell a bit short of expectations unfortunately. While the chicken was tender and well-flavoured, the smokiness was a little too overwhelming in my opinion. However it is served with a delicious garlicky sauce that really takes this dish to the next level. It is spicy, tangy, and helps neutralise the smokiness somewhat if you\'re not into that. The chicken was also a little red and undercooked. I definitely preferred their pork over this one. Priced at $30
So so good! While pork belly could be a little too fatty for most, this has the right meat to fat ratio. Each piece of pork is incredibly tender, but gamey enough so that each bite is quite satisfying. It is served with some basil and cucumber concoction that\'s really makes it a bit more refreshing and helps with the rather meaty dish. Quite a generous portion is served, and this would be excellent for sharing. Priced at $28
The fried chicken was super crunchy and had a unique seasoning that was on the sweet side (but still yumz). The cauliflower sabbich converted the meat-lover in me. Lamb shakshouka was fork tender. Definitely one of the best places for brunch.
Toasted Turkish bread topped with smashed avocado, slabs of haloumi cheese and mushrooms all the way from Kranji. I\'m sure even meat-lovers will be seduced by the charms of this vegetarian dish. 
The truffle oil is intoxicating and goes brilliantly with the cheeses: a quartet of Brie, Camembert, Parmesan and cream cheese. Slammed together between slices of sourdough with some sweetish Branston pickles, the melting cheeses can hardly be contained - oozing out like molten lava. \n<br />The accompanying tomato soup is what all tomato soups should aspire to be when they grow up - sophisticated. Thanks to the multi-layering of smokiness and selected herbs, it is as far as one can get from the classic one-note that I associate tomato soups with.
When comes to Mediterranean Cuisine, I tend to be more skeptical and it\'s not an everyday meal that I can do. But dining at the most unpretentious cafe which given me a whole new different vibe about their brunch fare they served @artichoke_sg!
The selection of brunch items are rather limited to two small handfuls, but catering to everyone\'s liking and keeping it simple at the same time. This is definitely not the usual sight of bacon cuts, having on with maple glazed and accompanied with poached eggs, pickled red cabbage, roasted pumpkin &amp; pistachio dukka.
It may not look, or sound like much (I almost bypassed it on the menu), but this smoked chicken has the ability to knock your socks off. Never would I have imagined that this beautiful chicken would taste like....bacon. Thanks to it being smoked lovingly for goodness knows how long, the flavor is both surprising and addictive - it\'s been days and I can\'t stop thinking about it. Perfect for sharing between 4 and served with a side of pickles and garlic aioli. 
Oh the words to describe this ain\'t enough to paint that flavour profile I\'d like you to imagine. So much umami, depth and soul. You have to try it for yourself.
Exciting new item on the brunch menu at @artichoke_sg so I had to order it! It would have been the perfect grilled cheese if not for the overly crispy bread which took some effort to break apart. The thing that capture my heart was the smoked tomato soup that this was served with - so simple, so hearty and smokey. Would I order this again? Absolutely. \n<br />#artichokesg #burpple
And those paprika fries and tahini coleslaw. Mmmm. If you\'re trying to cut down on fried food and carbs, this would make your knees wobble and instantly convert your day to a cheat day. Not. Your. Everyday. Fried Chicken. \n<br />In other news, the smoked salmon pancakes have returned to the @artichoke_sg brunch menu! Whoohoo!
Big love for @artichoke_sg @trueddd\'s mezzes. This one with  Spinach leaves, tumeric yoghurt, cracked pistachios and fatty raisins. No idea how the team comes up with these flavour pairings, it\'s just brilliant!! They say mezzes are for sharing but I\'m inclined to insist on having this all by meself thanks. 
A sturdy white chocolate casing hides juicy chunks of mango and a soft centered coconut rice pudding in the middle whilst the crunch factor is sustained by toasted coconut flakes and broken up Rice Krispie treats that the stick took a happy dive into, just before setting„ÄÇ\n<br />‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n<br />Love‚Ä¢Je T\'aime‚Ä¢ Ti Amo‚Ä¢ I don\'t know how else to spell it out to you„ÄÇ
Tonight I created and served this monster at an @artichoke_sg wedding. Think a 12inch by 20inch full on Snickers destruction. \n<br />Introducing the Snickers Cookie Cake. \n<br />Double chocolate chip cookies, smoked cream cheese frosting, gooey caramel, roasted peanuts, marshmallows, nuggets of brownies and pretzel sticks.
Spontaneous decision to have brunch here - middle eastern fusion food served with plenty of spices to whet our appetite. There was no looking back from the first bite. Could not get enough of the mushrooms on toast with Haloumi cheese, nor the fried chicken with its oh so tender meat. A repeat visit is most certainly in order. 
That\'s the adorable name awarded to the bro-friendly junk-food-reinvented menu that Artichoke served over the past 5 days. Our favourite was the Fish Tacos that came with Dorito-crusted fish, ikura, and a squid ink tartar sauce. The fish was fresh, tender, and wonderfully crisp. Contrasted with savoury juicy ikura bubbles and a tangy vinegary slaw, it was a wonderful starter to our dinner.
Tonight @arentijustawesome didn\'t change my perception, but she sure did make this bangin\' Smoked Tomato concoction, superbly flavourful, great amount of tang and spice. Well done my dear, this is another of those \"proud mama\" moments I\'m having again watching these talented kids outdo themselves time and again xxx\n<br />They\'re serving this at @artichoke_sg alongside a couple of Grilled Cheese Sandwiches for \"Dude, Where\'s My Food?\" week, up till this Saturday only. \n<br />24bucks/ 2 Grilled Cheese Sandwiches + Smoked Tomato Soup
Tomato soups to me have always been a real bore, it\'s something I think most restaurants have on the menu just cause it\'s one of those \"mandatory\" items. \n<br />Tonight @arentijustawesome didn\'t change my perception, but she sure did make this bangin\' Smoked Tomato concoction, superbly flavourful, great amount of tang and spice.

Who can imagine fried cauliflowers would be so awesome? Artichoke perfects the art of making vegetables taste amazing. Balanced and light, this will make any carnivore fall in love. Easily.
It\'s not everyday that I enjoy a Mediterranean dish as I\'m an extremely picky eater üòÖ but I could finish this entire hot pan all by myself, which pretty much shows how good it is! üòã #Burpple #artichoke
.\n<br />|\n<br />Crispy pork belly with lightly char-ed baguette. The pickled cabbage created the contrast in the texture and lighten the heaviness of porky flavors. Such delights!!!!
Pretty sure these need no introduction. I had the Mango Sticky Rice creamsicle, and was pleasantly  delighted at first bite: white chocolate coating with toasted coconut flakes and rice puffs. Can\'t accurately describe the ice cream; coconut milk ice cream with a generous amount of fresh mango chunks, and some sticky rice. Excuse my inability to do this creamsicle justice with words, but like. It\'s so good that you just gotta have one all to yourself. 
What you see is a glistening white frost of coconut flakes and rice Krispy snowing down on a bed of lushness, a creamy white chocolate. Hidden beneath are the true gems, a coconut rice pudding ice cream tickled with chunks of sweet mango. \n<br />I see hope for Singapore\'s dessert future. Innovation is starting and I\'m excited. \n<br />Monster loves his neh neh! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #nehnehpop
Man, this was sublime. Texture was akin to that of cottage cheese, but with a lighter taste. The pickled onions and cherry tomatoes added acidity and brightened the dish, which was great because a hearty serving of cheese can get monotonous. This was so good, the table next to us ordered a second serving üòã
Conversation starter for anyone with a bit of gutterbrain (don\'t pretend!). Left is Mango Sticky Rice which is rich with coconut cream and mango chunks (better for sharing), right is Rocky Road (I personally preferred this) which is chocolatey and covered with fizzy pop candy (?) - fun to eat! A bit on the pricey side but if u don\'t mind spending more it\'s worth a try for these unique concoctions. Any ice cream is good in this sweltering heat üòÖ
This was so good! The bread was well toasted and topped with rockets and feta cheese. You would love this even if you don\'t like cheese. 
I\'ve set my expectations really high for this dish and it has totally won my heart over. Perfectly poached eggs, tender meat and an extremely fresh pita.
The chilli-heat from the spicy crab mayo and zhoug coriander sauce is like a shadow. Rather stealthily, it trails you the whole time you are eating the \"Smoked Salmon Balik Ekmek\". While it hovers in the background, you get a whole school of smoked salmon, shaved fennel salad, arugula and onions coming up to greet you boldly. With the flavourful bread and paprika fries, this generously-sized sandwich is great for those who don\'t have the time of day for the meek in taste.
Milk chocolate kulfi dipped in milk chocolate and rained on with crushed ice cream cone crumbs. It\'s a rich chocolate indulgence, all right.
It\'s Monday, but we\'re reminiscing last night when we indulged at Artichoke\'s Bangkok Jerk-off between superstars Chef Bjorn Shen and Tim Ross-Watson.
Clockwise from top left: fried plantains with mango hot sauce, jerk chicken with spring onion salad, waterfall pork belly with Thai herb salad and som tum (papaya salad). I would pawn off my left toenail for more of the waterfall pork belly - it is positively voodoo levels of addictive.
Total awesomeness on a plate! If a meat-lover like me can be seduced by this plate of toasted Turkish bread heaped with slabs of haloumi cheese, organic mushrooms, smashed avocado and a Japanese mustard called mizuna, you can imagine how dazzling it must be.

I thoroughly enjoyed the flakiness of these turkish pastries but they unfortunately were also way too sweet.
I really enjoyed the charred bits - this is an example of a simple ingredient taken to a new level. But we still thought it was a little pricey..
This was pretty disappointing because it sounded really enticing but it ended up way too gamey (and i typically like gamey lam), dry and stringy..
Expect a long waiting time if you don\'t make reservations at Artichoke, set in the compound of the beautiful Sculpture Square. If you\'re unfamiliar with Middle Eastern flavours, Artichoke is a great place to start. A constant delight is their Mezze Platter ($26), it\'s the best way to start and share a meal with your friends, alongside a hearty Lamb Shakshuka ($26). Also go for the Feta Burrata ($23) if you love all things creamy and cheesy, and do not miss out on the Bacon Chop ($10) -- a mammoth-sized slab of maple-glazed bacon! For dessert, get the delightfully sweet Baklava Sampler. There are so many outstanding dishes, so grab your family or friends because you\'ll want to regret nothing by trying everything.
Having tried their lambgasm some time back, I was thrilled to try out their brunch menu. Instead of the usual eggs Ben, waffles, their items are heavily influenced with Moroccan/ Middle Eastern flavors. I chose the lamb Shakshouka with baked eggs, which was lovely. The lamb was tender and the whole dish was so good and rich with flavor. It can be a little heavy though, so best to be shared with someone else.
When friends from overseas come for a visit, I like to take them to Artichoke for dinner because the food is really unique and never fails to please.\n<br />Besides ordering my must-have mezzes with pita bread plus my new favourite, the feta-burrata cheese on toasted Turkish bread, here are the dishes that I always get to satisfy our souls and fill our bellies.\n<br />Top: This barbecue Moroccan whole fish is a fresh seabass that\'s been rubbed with piquant chermoula paste and preserved lemon butter before it meets the fire. It tastes absolutely lovely with a big squirt of juice from the grilled lemon. ($30++ for the one featured but it can change based on market price) \n<br />Middle left: The smoked chicken is squiggled with garden herb relish and accompanied by toum garlic sauce and Lebanese pickles. It looks dry but believe me, every inch of the chicken meat is moist and tender, and deeply infused with a beguiling smoky aroma. ($26++)\n<br />Middle right: Succulent and sweetish, the charcoal grilled pork belly dish is usually the biggest hit at the table. It\'s only very slightly spicy having been laced with shish kebab spices and a coffee-date BBQ sauce. Creating more excitement are kernels of corn and crunchy, chilled strips of yuzu pickles that the pork belly pieces are tossed in. ($26++)\n<br />Bottom left: Probably the best disguised vegetable I have met apart from french fries (but hmmm... do potatoes count as a vegetable?) Whatever the case, I find the crunchy florets of fried cauliflower tossed with almonds, currants and pomegranate in mint and garlic yogurt dressing, highly addictive. ($16++)\n<br />Bottom right: The big pieces of locally-grown mushrooms are stir fried with spinach in chopped garlic, Thai basil and scattered with za\'atar breadcrumbs before serving. I love how it has a \"meaty\" texture although technically, this is a vegetarian dish. ($18++)
Brilliantly strategised to conquer tastebuds and make them collapse in ecstasy is this well put-together dish. The slightly salty, creamy feta burrata cheese that\'s made in-house, is enhanced with a garlicky basil relish before being piled on top of the lightly toasted Turkish bread. Expect little bursts of sweetness from the pomegranate seeds scattered all over. To an extent, the organic tomato salad does the same. More party in the mouth comes courtesy of the caramalised baby corn. The fact that it is the only dish on the menu available for both brunch and dinner says a lot about its popularity.
I love everything about artichoke cafe! The location is a bit harder to find but that\'s what make it so special! The outdoor dining place is cooling and the dim light make the place cozy and comfortable. The staff are friendly and effective! Lastly, the food is so amazing! Love how they use simple ingredients to cook all the hummus and others! Must try!! ‚ù§Ô∏è kudos to them! 
A tiny but cosy cafe located somewhere around Bugis area which is a little bit hard to find as there\'s no proper signage indicating the name of the cafe. Nonetheless, I\'m glad to find this cafe because all the foods served are so delish, even a simple saut√©ed mushroom tastes so good! 
If you\'ve ever tasted the \"deviant Middle Eastern\" cuisine at Artichoke Cafe + Bar (and become a die-hard groupie like I have), do yourself a favour and grab this badass of a cookbook whipped together by Owner-Chef Bjorn Shen.\n<br />Nothing is ever straightforward with him. So what you get is 256 pages filled not just with recipes of his awesomely creative dishes but also the story of how Artichoke came to be. Plus everything else in between. Told in his distinctive style, Chef Bjorn also spills the beans on the nitty-gritty of running an F&amp;B establishment which makes for an informative read.\n<br />Get it at major bookstores, www.epigrambooks.sg and at Artichoke itself. 
Yup, the ever creative chef and his team are going into the making of ice-cream. If this scoop of deeply aromatic, densely creamy Pandan flavour (topped with crushed and reconstructed Oreo cookies) is anything to go by, I reckon we should all be very, very excited.\n<br />My spoon is on standby.
When Chef Bjorn Shen gives his distinct spin on pancake, I sit up and listen, and make sure I order a serving. Trust him to mix things up and push out a cool (also in terms of temperature) version of it.\n<br />A single, large, 1-inch thick pancake comes piled with a generous heap of smoked salmon slices and creamy egg mayo salad. On all that then goes Jim Beam whisky-enhanced sour cream, shaved onions, wasabi pea \"dukka\" (an Egyptian blend of flavoured and toasted nuts) followed by a drizzle of orange blossom honey.\n<br />The recommended way to eat this is to slice through the stack vertically, so you get all the flavours in every mouthful. I did just that and (no kidding) I was rolling my eyes with pleasure over every luscious mouthful.
Measuring about an inch in thickness, this glossy glory of a bacon chop is pure stickily-sweet, smokey meatiness. It is a must-have whenever I am at Artichoke, regardless of whatever else I may be ordering.\n
Steel yourself for the onslaught as it is so aromatic and rich and divine, you won\'t be able to think straight after the first bite. Like a siren\'s call, you and your spoon will be helplessly drawn to this warm, moist pudding topped with coffee jelly cubes and peanut caramel; all of which are half-immersed in a pool of cool, luscious burnt milk custard cream.\n<br />Then after what seems like only a mere moment later, you\'re staring at an empty plate, with sauce-smeared smiling lips. Yep, just like that, it\'s all gone.
Smoked egg, hummus, salad, fried cauliflower on top of pita bread :) üòòüòòüòò
Interesting American + Singapore fusion, macaroni being replaced by local ingredient: the rat noodle. A very tasty, and heavy dish ! 
Everything was on point and huge on flavour! Fell in love with Artichoke the minute I put some of their food in mah mouth. 
Creamy scrambled eggs paired with a huge slab of house smoked bacon and fluffy pita
I never knew date pudding can taste this good. Please read all about it at http://www.xiaoyangmeimei.blogspot.sg
This is heaven on a plate! 
You can\'t beat the taste of homemade lemonade. The one at Artichoke is well balanced and doesn\'t ever veer into the too-tart territory. This tall drink with its slices of lemon, mint leaves and ruby red pomegranate seeds, is also a joy to behold. Just looking at it makes me feel refreshed.
Served slightly warm, their \"gula melaka\" cake which is actually an inspired take on the traditional \"basbousa\" (a Middle Eastern-style semolina cake), has grated coconut and dried longans within, and comes covered in almond flakes. Moist with a complex and caramelly sweetness, the best way to enjoy it is with a cup of coffee.
In my humble opinion, this is the greatest gift Chef Bjorn Shen has bestowed upon mankind. Made in-house, this slab, yes it is a slab, of bacon is amazingly delicious with smoky sweetness. It comes with nicely scrambled eggs, a bit of salad and a pita bread for $20++. Everything is good but clearly, I only have eyes for the bacon chop.
Fava bean stew, picked veg, hard boiled egg and tahini on homemade pita bread. Best pita bread I\'ve had so far, so amazingly fluffy and warm and scrumptious (: $17! 
#onthetable - from top clockwise: Hummus (chickpea &amp; tahini), Turkish pide, Muhammara (red pepper, walnut, pomegranate), and Babaghanoush (smoked eggplant &amp; pomegranate). Mop up these delicious mezze with crusty za\'atar-spiced pide bread; its porous texture perfect for trapping all the goodness.
Artichoke is one of those cafes you go to for a full-on meal, and is known for packing in surprising Middle Eastern flavors in the best ways possible. Hidden in a gorgeous courtyard, this gem is perfect for brunch or dinner. Go for the Mezze Platter or Lamb Shakshuka for brunch, and the Sultan\'s Delight for dinner. Finish off with the baklava samplers from Overdoughs next door. Don\'t forget to make reservations! Photo by Jayne Tan

Char Chan Teng 1. \n<br />Curry Span, Mamee Salad, Oyster Sauce Vinaigrette and Egg. \n<br />This is like the Hong Kong style Maggi Mee with Luncheon Meat - È§êËõãÈ∫µ. They dissembled it and made this. \n<br />Handmade Curry Span was the foundation of this dish. I couldn\'t taste the curry but the grainy texture made this span very unique. \n<br />As the egg yolk flow down, it soften fried noodle. The noodle soaked up the egg yolk and eating it with a bite of span was simply heavenly. \n<br />The best part about this dish was that when i got bored with the taste, the hint of mint and rocket brought the boring taste back alive. The dash of oyster sauce vinaigrette balanced the salty span. I had no idea oyster sauce and vinaigrette came so well together.

Haloumi cheese is unlike any other cheeses I\'ve had. It\'s firm, chewy in a slightly squeaky way, and satisfyingly salty. Whenever I eat it, I can\'t help but think of it as a meat because it\'s substantial. At Artichoke, it is served with the sweetest whole baby tomatoes (that have had their skin painstakingly removed), a few butter lettuce leaves and some type of green sprouts. To me, the dish is really appealing both in terms of look and taste.
The prawns were gigantic and needless to say with Chef-Owner Bjorn Shen\'s sky-high standards, daaaammnn fresh! What bowled me over was the killer gravy - a superb lip-smackingly tasty creamy sauce made with spicy Harissa (a Tunisian hot Chili pepper paste). Even when the prawns were gone, we were wiping up whatever we could salvage from the pan with the last of our crusty bread. 
Every visit to Artichoke starts with me over-ordering and ends with me groaning from over-eating. What can I say? I am hopelessly in lust with the mezze at Artichoke.\n<br />Each dish is a creation that\'s moan-worthy in its fabulousness. Always freshly prepared, they showcase playful creativity of flavours and textures. From silver sardines to a dip of silky beetroot and another that\'s bejeweled with pomegranate, there is nothing but pleasure to be found here.

\"Deviant Middle-Eastern\" is how Artichoke describes their food, which we have to say, is an extremely accurate way of putting it. There\'s nothing not to love here- bold, hearty, unique flavors that surprise and comfort you at the same time. Set in the beautiful Sculpture Square, it\'s hard to find a better place to treat your belly on a weekend. Don\'t be afraid of the \"Middle Eastern\" label, you\'re gonna love every darned crumb of food. Be sure to make reservations for brunch, it\'s always packed.

To-die-for bacon!
Mezze platter, of which the beet root was the star. An extremely generous serving of lamb shakshouka made it the most value for money, and simply satisfying. Their dirty fries is always a must have, I always find myself wolfing them down before the mains arrive. The ful medames- Egyptian fava beans, (bottom left) with the perfect egg very tasty and extremely filling! Overall, I love coming here for brunch, never fails to satisfy. 
We probably ordered too much food, but the Lamb Shashuka was to die-for. Apparently they do sell out early, so wake up early for it!

*\n<br />Date pudding with burnt dulce de leche custard, espresso agar and cashew brittle with a scoop of salted dulce de leche softie on top. The taste of the burnt dulce de leche and the texture of the espresso agar with the date pudding made the whole combination so unami and addictive!\n<br />*\n<br />Chendol in a neh neh pop. The delicious flavours of gula melaka (palm sugar) and coconut milk in an artisanal creamsicle. Amazing!\n<br />*\n<br />Chef @bjornshen\'s use of bold, contrasting yet somehow complementary flavours is evident even in his desserts.

*\n<br />The hot skillet prawns is a must order. The sauce made of green harissa and split cream was intense and flavourful. Served with lots of fried onions which made it taste even better.\n<br />*\n<br />The other dish which I will happily come back for is the caramelised cauliflower.

Whole grilled seabass with chermoula onion relish preserved lemon butter and grilled lemon. Another dish which was sold out the last time we were here. We made sure dinner was early this time around so that nothing would be sold out üòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />This was incredibly tasty.

In its own ink with chicken skin dukkah and spicy avocado zhoug.\n<br />*\n<br />This was sold out the last time we were here and now that we have tasted it, we can totally understand why.

Fried brussel sprouts, raw cauliflower \'grains\', red cabbage, pickled onions, almonds and labneh ranch (dressing).

With toum garlic sauce, tomato ezme and dirty onion.

With tahini (sesame seed paste) yoghurt, dill oil and shallots.

With green harissa (Maghrebi hot chilli pepper paste), split cream, fried onion and coriander.\n<br />*\n<br />The flavours were very strong and bold. The sauce was sooo delicious that we used the pitta to mop up all of it! Chef-owner @bjornshen does an amazing job of combining strong yet contrasting flavours. I especially loved the taste of the spicy Maghrebi pepper paste üòç. His generous use of fried onions üòçüòç also won our hearts over.\n<br />*\n<br />Thanks @veronicaphua and @blueskiescottonclouds for the recommendation.

Hot skillet prawns cooked with green harissa, split cream, fried onions and coriander. They were finger licking good. In fact, we ordered an extra serving of pita just to mop up all that sauce. Also, although this was meant for sharing, you may just want to consider ordering a portion for yourself because it\'s that good! #prawns #greenharissa #middleeasternfood #seafood #fingerlickinggood #artichokesg #burpple #burpplesg #sg #sgig #bscc_middleeasternsg
Chef @bjornshen actually made brussel sprouts taste absolutely delicious. This dish makes you crave for more! The sprouts are fried and raw cauliflower grains, red cabbage, pickles onions and almonds are added to it, and its topped up with a generous dollop of labneh ranch #brusselsprouts #brassicatabbouleh #artichokesg #middleeasternfood #starters #salads #burpplesg #burpple #sg #sgig #bscc_middleeasternsg
So here we are at Artichoke\'s. Kickstarted our dinner with Muhammara which is a dip made from roasted red pepper, walnuts, pomegranate molasses and fried vine leaf. We also had the Hummus made from chickpea, tahini served with sumac, pickled cucumber and black sesame.  Both were really yummy with warm fluffy pita breads. It\'s my first time here and these starters gave me a warm fuzzy feeling that we would all enjoy dinner #middleeasternfood #artichokesg #dips #muhammaradip #hummus #mezes #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_middleeasternsg
I figured about 3 km till I landed here. A cafe housed in surrounding greenery. Quite run down but that was the beauty of it. Rustic and a feel of that kampong spirit.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />I traipsed in a full house with hungry diners. Lucky for me, I could get a table outside under the tent next to a tree... a blue pea tree with pretty blue pea flowers in its bluish blooming glow.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />So my dessert is everything chocolate.. well almost. Called Chocolate Brulee. Tahini chocolate pudding which was a very soft creamy mousse texture. On top of the pudding is a layer of crisp chocolate shell. I believed it was flambed cos I could taste the smoky charred flavor which tasted pretty sexy. A dollop of fresh cream adds another level of richness to the already rich chocolate. But but.... the orange curd and jelly provided that zesty and scintillating finish. The citrussy aftertones minimalised the sweetness and the one dimensional chocolate taste on the palate.\n<br />üîπüî∏\n<br />Pleasant place to chill-lax if one dont mind the hot weather but of course there is the indoor aircon area. So from something old to something new and blue (as in the blue pea tree). So fun traipsing alone. You should try it sometime, you never know what you can discover along the way.

The star of this dish was in actual fact, not the char grilled octopus legs (which was a tad too charred at the ends, but thankfully generally moist and tender), but the creamy, savoury goodness of its sidekick hummus. Who knew chickpeas could be done to such a rich, decadent texture?! Brb, slipping into a food coma as I reminisce the flavour in my mouth once more......... #igsg #sgeats #food #foodporn #8dayseat #vscocam #vsco #burrplesg #tslmakan #artichoke
Mezze dishes at Artichoke üëçüèª Try the dinner menu at Artichoke - I love how unique each mezze and sharing plate is! The pita bread is absolutely doughy heaven, as if chewing into a tuft of soft fluffy cloud. It also well compliments the sour and salty mezze dishes which exploded with flavour once in your mouth. A definite to-try mezze dish would be the aubergine (because \'eggplant\' is just too mainstream...) spread with pomegranate seeds. #igsg #sgeats #food #igfood #tslmakan #burrplesg #vsco #vscocam #artichoke #8dayseats #onthetable
They have an interesting repertoire that\'s a mix of Middle Eastern classics (some with a twist) and a couple that I can\'t place geographically but taste so darn good who cares! üòÜ \n<br />#veronicaphuaeats #artichokesg #mezze #burpple #burpplesg #whati8 #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #burppletastemaker

Chunks of soft and gooey salted caramel lay hidden within its creamy depths releasing hints of salt with every bite.

Finally got my neh neh pops. Lollll seriously can\'t say it without laughing. We got rocky road and mango sticky rice. Rocky road was chocolate ice cream w toasted marshmallow coated in choc w fruity pebbles mixed in. Haven\'t had fruity pebbles for the longest time and it was so nostalgic! As for the mango sticky rice, I must say it won hands down. Coconut ice cream w mango chunks and sticky rice chunks encased in white chocolate w crispy rice and toasted coconut flakes. 
Today\'s brunch situation. The burrata got   attacked before anything else reached the table. Look at that glazing bacon and those grilled cauliflowers üòç

Don\'t say you weren\'t warned!
After much deliberation, I went for the Mango Sticky Rice. It was a divine creation that had a creamy coconut rice pudding ice-cream block filled with real mangoes, and coated with a crisp white chocolate that\'s covered with toasted coconut flakes and rice crispies. Make sure you leave space in your tummy for one when you dine here. #artichokesg #artichokecafe #artchokecafeandbar #nehnehpop #plumideas #sgeats #sgfoodies #burpple #burppletastemaker

Comes with scrambled eggs, pita bread and greens~
Pricey at $220 (shared amongst 7), but so delicious! Juicy, tender meat that fell off the bone.

Bak Chor Mee. \n<br />In a sandwich. Lingam\'s Chilli Sauce. \n<br />It tasted exactly like Bak Chor Mee served like a Kong Bak Bao (Êâ£ËÇâÂåÖ). The only different from a normal Bak Chor Mee was that they fried the Mee Pok. Hence, giving this dish a extra layer of crispness. \n<br />Interesting idea but I still prefer the Bak Chor Mee served in a bowl. \n<br />161 Middle Road\n<br />S188978\n<br />Tel: 6336 6949\n<br />Tue - Fri: 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sat: 11:30am - 2:45pm, 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sun: 11:30am - 2:45pm
Pinoy Dude Food\n<br />Pork Cheek. Pig Ear Sisig. Egg. Popped Corn. Calamasi. Pandesal. \n<br />The caramelized pork cheek and ear served with Pandesal (Philippine handmade bread). The pork cheek and ear contained a lot of gelatin, so after they was caramelized, they became very chewy and heavy. The additional calamasi juice cut through the heavy pork cheek and ear and made it easier to eat. \n<br />Tear open the Pandesal and stuff the pork cheek and ear. I felt that the dish was slightly too sweet for my taste. Pretty interesting to eat. \n<br />I love the idea they added a raw egg into the hot pan. It provided a layer of creaminess and stick the pork cheek and egg together. \n<br />161 Middle Road\n<br />S188978\n<br />Tel: 6336 6949\n<br />Tue - Fri: 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sat: 11:30am - 2:45pm, 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sun: 11:30am - 2:45pm
Shaking Bacon. \n<br />Bacon Wor Toss. Herbs. Nouc Cham. Peanuts. Lettuce Wrap. \n<br />This was the best dish of the night. \n<br />I did a bit of googling about this dish. It was the \"pork\" version of the B√≤ L√∫c L√°c (Shaking Beef). A French influenced dish, cubes of bacon been stir fried with tomato, herbs and peanut. Must eat with the lettuce like a taco. \n<br />The instant I bite into the wrap, the fragrant from the herbs just exploded. Even thought this dish looked heavy, the taste was surprised light. Every single ingredient just came together in harmony.

Soul Food. \n<br />Chopped Pork. Green Curry. Pickles. Crackers. \n<br />The awesome soul food. I loved green curry and pulled pork, and this is my favorite dish! The pork was so tender and soft that it melted in my mouth. Because the pork was so soft, the green curry was able to penetrate through the entire pork. \n<br />My way of eating it - Crackling Cracker, pickle and green curry pork. These three layers formed the ultimate Triplet. \n<br />The sour pickle countered pungent green curry, making its taste not too overwhelming. I could finish this entire bowl by myself. It was so good that we finished the curry but lots of crackers were leave behind. \n<br />161 Middle Road\n<br />S188978\n<br />Tel: 6336 6949\n<br />Tue - Fri: 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sat: 11:30am - 2:45pm, 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sun: 11:30am - 2:45pm

I couldn\'t really felt the popping from the Ebiko. The seasoning was rather heavy. \n<br />However, when I tried eating all of them together and it was great. Crispy crackling pork skin + Refreshing Cucumber + Soft Tuna + Creamy Ebiko =  They were like tea party, every one brought something. \n<br />161 Middle Road\n<br />S188978\n<br />Tel: 6336 6949\n<br />Tue - Fri: 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sat: 11:30am - 2:45pm, 6:30pm - 9:45pm\n<br />Sun: 11:30am - 2:45pm
