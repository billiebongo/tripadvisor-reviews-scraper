Interesting blend of Ethiopia, Sumatra and Brazil - Nutty with a dark chocolaty tone.
This one was called graveyard. Vaguely remembered the red cream to be beetroot cream? Am I correct? The taste was  a bit salty though.

A delightful hot chocolate in a cafe, tucked away in a quiet corner of Lorong 1, Toa Payoh. Love the great service here too! 
When you are limited to the basics like bread, mushrooms and cheese, precision is everything. Like a well orchestrated symphony, the caramelized onions sealed the delicate Brie cheese and mini portobello mushrooms together.   Probably the best tasting meal I\'ve had at a cafe this month (daily press is the 4th indie one if you must know). I\'m definitely coming back. 
Simple as it seems, it\'s really an awesome combination of the Apple, bacon and cheddar. Will definitely go back for it when the craving kicks in.
The Yuzu &amp; Chocolate Milkshake ($7) barely had any yuzu taste (it would be good as just a chocolate milkshake). The Key Lime Tart ($7.90) was quite ex for such a small slice. Also, the meringue was too thick that it was almost cloying.
Tasty sandwiches at affordable prices just a few doors down from Creamier. Was blown away by the ABC. Coffee was alright, but it\'s those sandwiches that will keep us coming back!
The beef was really tender and yummy! It\'s cooked with tomato and vegetable stew , the white stuff on top is Parmesan. :) they\'re finally making their pasta dishes available all day!

Not sure why difference of $0.50 can make the size of the cup so small. 😂
Surprisingly good ABC sandwich @the.daily.press
One of their off-the-menu specials that are only available on certain days, the Aburi Vegetable Salad is a bowl of grilled vegetables such as broccoli, potatoes, pumpkins, capsicums, onions which are fresh and tasty, speckled with fried luncheon meat bits for bacon-like savouriness. A satisfying light meal that\'s bound to surprise your tastebuds.
Tried out this quaint cafe under a block of HDB flats, known for their sandwiches, especially this ABC sandwich.
Delightfully tasteful but it feels like I need to nuke through the bread to get to the inner. 😂
Back to work later. I\'m almost done and is way ahead of deadlines! Fk yea ~
Candied bacon that was a bit too sweet for me (syrup was just dripping off my sandwich when I lifted it up to eat) though it had the right amount of crisp. Slightly sourish green apples provided a nice refreshing twist. Cheddar cheese was melted and gooey. Overall quite enjoyed this, I like how the bread here are all toasted very nicely. 
$11 a serving. ABC =&gt; Apple Bacon Cheddar Sandwich. The green apple slices gives it a crunchy, crispy, juicy texture. The house-smoked bacon tastes sweet and smokey as it has been caramelized. The thin layer of cheddar melted on the buttery crispy toasted muilt grain bread. Overall it is a balance of savoury and sweet. Served with a side of tangy sweet greens.
A quaint cafe in the neighbourhood with simple/minimalist concept. Interesting combinations of filling in their sandwiches (eg: Korean fried chicken) What is really good about this cafe is that their water jug is generously filled with lots of lemon!!🍋
Vinegar was a bit too strong. The three layer pork is wonderfully tender and meaty. Probably tenderised by all the vinegar. Went well with the ciabatta. Loved the bread with the little bit of meat gravy.
Really for the health junkie. Whole grain bread, apples, walnuts. All in one sandwich. Apples were sweet and provided a nice light taste. House cured salmon was fresh, but very bland. Though it came in a good amount, I could barely taste any salmon. Not such a fan of walnuts in my sandwiches either. 
Babi Pongteh Sandwich ($12)\n<br />Carrot, Cucumber, Chilli, Ciabatta\n<br />The bread is quite difficult to slice through. Did ask to replace the bread with other type but recommend not to. The filling tastes quite tangy.
Check out my review on this 2 month old cafe in the Toa Payoh neighborhood on fatassbean.wordpress.com!
🙊 A great place to head to if you\'re ATTEMPTING to eat a little healthier, because their sandwiches are 😍😍. Great place, great food and great company! This instameet thing is really... Quite awesome. 😏
It is said that they made the sandwich from a panini press. The bread crust is hard but the unique taste of the salmon does make up for the shortfall, that\'s if you like the citrusy salmon. 😉

There\'s many places that offers the same few selection of sandwiches, but The Daily Press comes out with pretty unique ones such as this one; a rare combination of Korean flavours into sandwiches. Due to constraints, there is no deep-frying allowed in this area and therefore the chicken is actually oven-baked with Japanese Bread Crumbs to achieve a texture similar to fried batter. Ciabatta bread might be stiff to cut but we loved the chewiness of the bread and the crusty top. To further enhance the flavour, kimchi is added on top, which is made and fermented in-house that gives the distinct Korean feel to the sandwich. Paired with a garden salad that is dressed with Honey Mustard, giving the fresh vegetables a tinge of sweetness.
Flat White is pretty solid with chocolatey and earthy tones; the signature flavour profile of Liberty Coffee\'s Speakeasy blends they use.
A refreshing combination but the kimchi is overly spicy.. Will like it better if they could go easy on that. 
This came piping hot. Tomato soup was alright, had a nice herbal tone to it. Would be comforting on a cold day. Soup had bits of tomato and egg plant. Polenta probably isn\'t for everyone and this was rather plain and crumbly.  
The beef was a let down. Wasn\'t seasoned well and had a strange plastic taste. The sauce was rather pleasant with hints of onions and sesame. Priced at $15.
Really enjoyed this. The fried chicken is tender and was not greasy. The kimchi isn\'t the best, but works well enough. The salad was rather drenched with a sweet addictive dressing that went well with the sandwich. The combination of the fragrant crusty bread, sour and spicy kimchi and fried chicken can make me salivate even now! $12 well spent! 
Opened a mere two days ago is spanking new cafe, The Daily Press, located in Toa Payoh Lorong 1. Serving up a range of sandwiches, sharing plates and specialty coffee, this new addition to the belt makes for a casual space to catch up over good food and coffee. Sandwiches make up the bulk of their menu, and popular items include the Korean \"fried\" chicken sandwich with homemade kimchi on ciabatta ($12) and the roast beef sandwich with garlic, arugula and sesame on rye sourdough ($15). A great space for a casual meal or a sit-down over a cuppa - The Daily Press is a great addition to the cafe scene.
They are currently doing soft launch so the full menu will be out really soon from what I know. Had the elderflower &amp;\' mint freeze. Sounds weird but it kinda complement with the sandwiches. The Korean fried chicken sounds really unique though and we had the mushroom one but the bread is kinda hard though. The service here is actually quite good and I really enjoy your chatting with one of the staff there! Happy birthday to mei chin  by the way!
Due to their management regulation, The Daily Press will not be able to do serious frying within their compound. So here comes the \'fried\' Chicken, topped with homemade kimchi that is more on the spicy side due to shorter period of fermentation. Chicken is tender and not dry, which is definitely a plus point for me. Serious thoughts have been made for the sandwiches offered here and the proper execution is to be commended.
I have a #flatlay of my Assam pedas and chicken pesto pasta here. 🍝 ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ✨#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower

ABC- Apple, Bacon and Cheddar Sandwich is gooood!

I wanna give credit to this cafe that I regularly hang out at and to the barista. I often bring my daughter along for my caffeine fixes and her usual drink is a babycino. This is the first cafe that really takes pride in handcrafting a drink that is really simple. 1) 3D latte art 2) chocolate powder and syrup as part of the art 3) marshmallows. My daughter really enjoys it. Thanks Daily Press! PS: their coffee is good too!
Happy belated Halloween. 😅

I normally don\'t eat zucchini but this was yummy! Pasta was al dente too. Very satisfied with their pasta dishes so far. 😻😄

This is the first time I got served a cup of coffee in Singapore with one that I can drink immediately without burning my lips. Not used to this lower temp at first but gotta say is quite nice. Impressed! Strong coffee with good bitterish chocolate taste!
Fried Korean chicken with kimchi! Spicy &amp; sourish, so good!
The ABC sandwich now has a better balance of flavours, and my cuppa is certainly on point. Great stuff that makes for a most satisfying brunch #nofilter #wewantsugar
I read Seneca and can recite Shakespeare by heart, but I mess up the laundry, don’t answer my phone and blame the world when something goes wrong. I think I have a dream, but most of the days I’m still sleeping. The grass is cut. It smells like strawberries. Today I finished four books and cleaned my drawers. \n<br />Do you believe in a God? Can I tell you about Icarus? How he flew too close to the sun？
Very homely. I personally love their ABC sandwich too, which currently is available in the day until 4pm nia oops. 😝 .\n<br />#anchovypasta #pasta #thedailypress #omnomnom #cafe #sgcafes #makantimes #fatdieme #burpple
I\'d like it with a bit more aroma though. Too bad most of their desserts are sold out... Alamak. :
A solid cuppa, full bodied roasty with rich tones of dark chocolate.
As a non-salad/vegetable eating person, the salad was really delicious, dressed and seasoned really well. Ordered the Korean \"Fried\" Chicken sandwich and Beef Sandwich. They were both nicely seasoned. The beef was tender and the chicken was flavorful. The garlic in the beef complimented the sandwich, leaving no garlic breathe to linger after eating. 
Here\'s a latte post from @thedaily.press before I fly off to #UK! 😋 see yall in London! #sgcafefood #sgeats #cafesg #sgfoodlovers
