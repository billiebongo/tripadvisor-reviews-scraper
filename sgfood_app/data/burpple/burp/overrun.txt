This durian chendol was delicious! The icecream was smooth and flavourful. You may think that the strong durian flavour would cover the chendol but no, it really blends in well together! With $6, you can get this amount of quantity and quality which is pretty affordable. I would recommend that you share with one or two people because the portion is quite a lot for just one person. Overall a great experience!
\nChendol soft-serve ice cream returns in a majestic way at this Overrun Cafe. A newer version with it\'s very own twist from the oldies 711 Mr Softee. You could taste heaven perfectly!! 
The key to this Malaysian-style dessert? Lots of gula Melaka, green worm pandan jelly and the all-important chendol flavoured soft serve. Swing by Overrun\'s takeaway stand on a hot day and cool down with the Chendol Soft Serve ($6). It bears an uncanny resemblance to 7-Eleven\'s Mr Softee Chendol ice cream â€” except it\'s better because of the fresh ingredients! The store only churns out a limited amount of chendol soft serve a day, so be sure to head down early. Pro tip: Keep a look out on their Instagram for their elusive Durian Chendol soft serve â€” you won\'t want to miss it!\n<br />*Muslim-owned\n<br />Avg price: $6 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Wei Zhi Chiang
Ended up here in an attempt to beat the mad heat but the softserve melted as quickly as I did once I stepped back out under the merciless sun. This $6 cup comes with standard toppings of cendol jelly, coconut shavings and gula melaka sauce. It reminded me so much of the 7-Eleven Mr Softee\'s cendol ice-cream, but better cause of the toppings! This was smooth, slightly creamy and not overly sweet (ask for less gula melaka if you\'d like less sweet, they\'re very generous with it!). It\'s a big cup, so it\'s great for sharing and gobbling down before it melts!  
If you guys love mr softee chendol ice cream, you guys going to love this too! Worth the 30 mins of waiting ðŸ’¯
highly instagrammable and huge portion, but it is a tad bit too sweet. Sorry, but I think my reminiscent Mr Softee\'s is still chendol soft serve king! \n<br />#igsg #sgig #instaeats #sgeats #igeats #instafood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #igfoodies #igfood #western #wheretoeat #8dayseat #darzieeats #burpple #burpplesg #chopesg #overrun

Once you start, you just cant get enough of it and very soon you will be reaching the bottom of the cup, having gulped down the robust coconut ice cream, the smooth and silky green pandan jelly tossed in cloyingly sweet gula melaka
Sweet mother of gula Melaka was found hiding beneath the depths of this dessert along with healthy dollops of durian purÃ©e.
