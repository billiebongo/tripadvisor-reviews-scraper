Was told that they\'d ran out of regular tamagoyaki, and so I opted for the popular hitsumabushi set ($26.80++). The star of the show arrived not long after, in all its glistening and wickedly caramelised glory, waiting to be devoured. The meat, was fresh and tender (well that\'s a given), and I found myself slowly savouring the crispy, almost-burnt bits of skin - the best!!!!! 😩😩😩 of course every aspect is brought together by a tantalising umami-sweet unagi sauce! 
Given that it was listed in Singapore\'s Michelin Bib Gourmand list, it\'s no wonder that the queue was between 1.5-2h long. However, the dish did not disappoint. The unagi was well cooked, crispy yet flavourful. 🙌🏻\n<br />There are 3 ways of eating this, first is straight from the bowl (with or without the sweet/spicy/unagi sauce), second is to scoop some unagi and rice into the small bowl and add some fresh wasabi, spring onions and seaweed. Lastly, you can add some broth and eat it like the Chinese porridge. \n<br />I would love to go back some day, if I didn\'t have to queue.
Crispy unagi devoured in 25mins 😊😊 medium sized one at $26.80+ #manmanunagi #burpple
Reached at 6 (opening time) queued for an hour, and finished out food in 30 mins but it was worth it 💦 \n<br />They ran out of tamagoyaki (the replaced with with some spinach) so instead go ordering the medium I went for the Hitsumabushi at $26.80+. I dont really fancy unagi but this really changed my mind. 👐🏼
Heard a lot of raved reviews before heading there, so I had expectations coming into it. Had the Unatama (Medium) and I must say it was nothing special. Kudos to the fact that it was char grilled to be crispy but other than that the fish itself have not much flavour to it. The charcoal pretty much masked the fish flavour and not much of the kabayaki sauce could be tasted. My friends and I had to add the unagi sauces provided to us for flavour. Pretty average and coming from a Unagi Specialty Restaurant is just a let down.
Live eel is cut and grilled right before one\'s eyes (not for the weak to watch), making every piece of unagi heavenly goodness. A mix of tender soft flesh with crispy char-grilled skin, the unagi here is a notch above anything we\'ve tried. The dish we ordered allowed us to sample unagi in 3 ways (original, dried &amp; soup) &amp; each version was uniquely enjoyable. We esp liked the dried pairing of unagi with fresh wasabi, seaweed &amp; spring onions as they added texture and enhanced the unagi flavour.\n<br />⚠️ Best time to go would be before 5.35pm to make the first seating when it opens at 6pm. I arrived at 5.20pm and was the first person in the queue. Do also prepare umbrella/ hats &amp; water in case of sunny hot weather as there is minimal shade in the queue\n<br />📍Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant, 1 Keong Saik Road #01-01, S089109
•\n<br />There\'s really no time where Man Man doesn\'t come with a snaking line of people waiting, the key is to have good company and going when it isn\'t so HOT OUTSIDE.\n<br />•\n<br />That being said, the unagi is so worth the wait. Freshly grilled with zero fishiness, it goes so well with the fresh wasabi. Get the hitsumabushi. There are 3 sizes available and while the medium (shown, $26.80) is usually sufficient for me, I\'d usually end up wanting to have the large one because it\'s just so good. 😅
My dear friend, Phoebe, raves about this place...so I definitely must go at least once in my lifetime even though i don\'t usually eat unagi. The wait to get into the restaurant was soooo long that i was starving by the time we got in.

Being listed as the Bib Gourmand of Michelin Guide Singapore 2017, there is no doubt to the quality of charcoal-grilled Unagi here. What keeps foodies come back for more, is their mouth-watering Unagi that has that little bit of crisp and the enormous original flavour of the seafood. Typically, you can eat this Large Hitsumabushi set (S$35.80) either with broth poured over (as a sort of porridge), or with the condiments such as sauces and fresh self-grated wasabi. Or be like me, to just alternate between these two ways to savour the best taste of heavenly Unagi.
Queued for almost 2 hours for this ! Worth the effort though! ❤️
Price: $25.80+ The unagi was really soft and crispt but i had to wait for more than an hour.
Roasted on the outside and tender on the inside. Got to be the best unagi bowl I\'ve eaten so far.
✨9/10✨\n<br />.\n<br />Definitely the best unagi rice bowl in Singapore! The eel is lightly crisp on the outside, with pillowy-soft meat. Add a delicious sweet sauce, freshly grated wasabi and dashi broth, and you have a superstar 🌟 can\'t wait for my next visit!
Never.ever.had.sucha.awesome.ungai.before \n<br />The unagi was grilled to it\'s perfect crispiness and the sauce was just right, not too salty. Queued for 30mins on a Sat noon, totes worth it!!!
Fiery squids is in the house! Together with the oh so crispy and smokey unagi. Oishī!
Unagi Don with spices and dashi
You know what they say: the hungrier you are, the better the food tastes.
Finally tried the unagi here... all i can say is OISHII! The unagi is grilled to perfection, so tender and melts in your mouth! 
This was soooo good??!😍 TASTE: 8.5/10 Also they serve fresh wasabi where you had to grate it yourself how cool is that! But I must say, the queue is really too long (waited 1hr20min from 650pm) for this, wouldn\'t mind queuing 30min to taste this bowl of goodness😍 MY ADVICE: QUEUE EARLY, AVOID PEAK HOURS. Worth a try!!
Finally got some time to go out for a proper meal and a great one it was!
The flesh from this Unagi is fresh and you will be craving for another bowl!!!
The quality arguably lies not in the eel itself, but in the experience as a whole. The innately stickily sweet una don itself is highly customisable - you get different sauces to apply to your mountain of eel flesh, and also the option of adding dashi to make an eel porridge - and you also get to grate your own wasabi, which may either be balls of fun or immensely frustrating for those (like me) who drip with sweat in SOC-esque effort only to yield sad green Play Doh-esque baby lumps. Likely to remain exciting for a while because of the current buzz and redeemable bragging rights, but what happens after that...3.9/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />P.S. I went at 8:45pm on a weekday night, and queued for all of five minutes. Yay.
The shirayaki unagi ($24.80) can be ordered as an extra treat (alongside your Hitsumabushi set haha). The fresh eel is prepared similarly to the kabayaki, except without the unagi tare sauce, and served only with salt, fresh wasabi and light shoyu. This allows the chao ta and the kiam of the eel to really shine. Perfect for the unagi purist! 
ok la.. it\'s fresh... it\'s pretty good. Got the BBQ chaotah flavour more than usual and not as mushy as the ones I\'m normally accustomed to from everywhere else. They gave me the seat right infront of where they kill the eels. Won\'t spoil your appetite and post the video here! Haha #burpple
Simply b\'cos their charcoal grilled eels were damn good.\n<br />The Japan-flown in eels were prepared live and grilled in front of customers, which explained why they tasted so fresh and good. \n<br />Whether eaten 3-ways (original, with wasabi and condiments, or with soup in rice) or just on its own, the charcoal grilled Unagi was remarkably delicious. Its charred skin was crispy in the right places, meat was tender and moist, and the Unagi sauce just completed the dish. \n<br />Their queue was consistent despite quick turn-around of customers so some wait would be expected. But when we took our first bites all that wait so totally worthwhile. \n<br />Problem is, now we\'ll only want to come back here for Unagi.
Fresh from the tank and grilled to perfection in front of customers (if you\'re lucky enough to sit at chef\'s table). Skin was so crispy and charred just nice 🍱🐟🇯🇵❤ Get the chef recommended set ($26.80+, medium) and enjoy it in three different ways (original, with spices including freshly grated wasabi, and porridge style with the provided broth). Tip 2: go in small groups aka pairs and you will likely get to move ahead of the queue and get seats first 🎉 #burpple
Plus lucky it was just the two of us so we were able to get seats pretty fast and it was honestly the best unagi we\'ve tried - eels were so fresh they were just taken out of the tank and chargrilled to perfection with crispy skins that stayed crispy even towards to end of our meal!
Who knew unagi and omelette goes so well together ? Absolutely perfect !
3 ways to enjoy freshly grilled Unagi. Recommended by the staff, we portioning the Unagi don into four parts to try.
Went for the cheapest one ($18.90); and honest to say, the 2++ hours queue was definitely worth it. Freshly grilled unagi is a burst of flavor &amp; the crispiness is a delight in your mouth. Nonetheless, my personal preference will still be the soft-textured unagi compared to Man Man\'s crispy one. ☺ extra tip: if you are coming here for dinner, you might want to arrive there between 5-5.30pm (the earlier the better). Queue can get crazy long!
Medium Unagi Set, $25.80++.
Unagi Don aka 鰻丼 finally tried them after raving reviews from friends. An open concept kitchen where you\'ll see freshwater eel slay and skinned before charcoal-grilled, so counter seats are not for the faint hearted. Doused repeatedly with tare marinade and grilled to perfection, it has a slight charred skin but remains tender without any fishy taste. This leaves a burst of umami delightfulness with each bite!! Will love to head back for more soon.
Just that you should arrive at 11:30am to grab your seat - or else you may have to wait under the sun. But it\'s all worth it!
Unagi Omelette, more please! Ohh the layers of eggs cooked till perfection, the texture, the taste, i can eat 5 portions of this! Never knew unagi and eggs are matched in heaven
The hitsumabushi set, finally waited till theres a shorter queue to try this raved restaurant. Verdict: it lived up to the hype! Other than the fresh unagi, the broth is great too!
Be prepared to queue for this plate of fresh unagi, other than this fresh, tender unagi, dont forget to indulge in the freshly grated wasabi. Try the 3 sauces (spicy, sweet, salty) at the side for extra variety of flavours too. I suggest  to go lightly with the sea salt at the side thou.
Hitsumabushi ($26.80+) is probably what every blogger is writing about. So I ordered it, &amp; it was delicious. For a Unagi n00b like me (I don\'t eat it much because I don\'t fancy the texture), I like the idea of trying Unagi 3 different ways.
One of the better unagi dons that I\'ve tried so far, and really value for money too, if you don\'t mind the queue...
I get it now, I get the hype. The long queues that snake down the pathway on the flip side of Keong Saik isn\'t for nothing. I got a standard order of the famed Hitsumabushi Unagi Don ($26.80+) and it was incredible. The charred-ness of the unagi is perfect and what was most exciting to me was the set was served with a fresh knob of wasabi. Because we were greedy, we also got the umaki (unagi wrapped in an egg thing) and additional servings of kabayaki (with unagi sauce) &amp; shirayaki (salted broiled) unagi on the side. 
The thick dark sauce used to marinate the unagi before grilling gave a nice sweet savoury hit on the palate. The hitsumabushi offers 3 different ways to savour the unagi: plain, with the addition of freshly grated wasabi with seaweed and spring onions, or dashi stock to soak the rice and unagi together. My personal favourite was the freshly grated wasabi that gave a light kick to the smokiness of the unagi. Will definitely go back and get counter seating again to watch the crew skilfully debone and grill those fresh unagi before my eyes!
Large Una Don ($32.80)
The queue was snaking long even before it opens. Luckily we managed to make it for the first seating. Turnovers were quite fast too. This time round, less sauce compared to the previous time. You can add your own sauce anyways. For me, i just eat the way it is because it\'s crispy! Yummy.
Words can\'t express my disappointment upon finding out that they ran out of fresh wasabi (after asking the staff when this was served). The Hitsumabushi set ($26.80++) comes with a light and savoury dashi that you can enjoy with the unagi and rice. I would strongly suggest checking if they have fresh wasabi in stock before ordering (unless you\'re cool with low quality paste wasabi as a substitute). Thankfully, the unagi was perfect. Nice smokey grilled taste with a crisp skin!
Hitsumabushi @ 26.90++ at Man Man Japanese. Arrived at the entrance at about 9pm on a Wednesday, and there was a queue of about 5? But we managed to enter abt 10mins later. Place is pretty cramped as it is a small place and seats were placed pretty near to each other. Only about 5-6 seats are in front of the kitchen where you can see the chef doing the work. Unagi is really fresh and the sauce is good too. The broth comes in a flask and i finished the broth! It goes so well with the rice and unagi and diy freshly grinded wasabi, together with the seaweed spring onion garnish. I never eat wasabi elsewhere for i dislike the taste, but the fresh wasabi was really good. It isn\'t too pungent for my taste. And i finished up all the wasabi! Try it for if you detest wasabi!
I knew from the moment I laid eyes on you that there was something special about you, Man Man.
🇯🇵\n<br />I didn\'t make any reservation and reached about 12pm to a short queue in front of me. When I left 10mins before 1pm, there was no queue. So if you are interested, I say just go and queue during lunch!\n<br />🇯🇵\n<br />Kabayaki Teishoku S$26.80++\n<br />🇯🇵\n<br />I get why many people like this. While waiting, you are treated by the waft of charcoal aroma whenever their doors are opened. Then once inside, you can see the chefs preparing your unagi in the open kitchen right in front of you. And most importantly, their unagi (especially the skin) is grilled until really crispy and charcoal fragrant.\n<br />🇯🇵\n<br />But, unfortunately, the kabayaki unagi was too salty for me. I am not sure if it was the sauce or if they added extra salt, but it was so salty I couldn\'t finished the unagi. Not even their freshly grated wasabi could help.\n<br />🇯🇵\n<br />The thing is I\'m probably one of the rare ones who think so. As I squint my eyes from the salt overdose, I instinctively look around me to find consensus. What I saw were mainly satisfied faces and empty plates/bowls.\n<br />🇯🇵\n<br />I suppose people like me who have a lighter palate and who usually ask for less salt at zichar stalls should avoid this. Otherwise, you probably will enjoy this. For me, I prefer Bonta Bonta.\n<br />🇯🇵\n<br />Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant\n<br />1 Keong Saik Road #01-01, S089109\n<br />Mon to Sat, PH: 11.30am to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm\n<br />Sun: Closed\n<br />Tel: +65 6222 0678
#unagi. This was rather delicious, or.. More intriguing than delicious. I feel it\'s flavour is something you need to get used to. I finally popped by the tiny Unagi bolthole, #ManManUnagj. It felt really synthetic Japanese. The ceiling was low, furnishings more functional then decorative with an airtight focus on just one ingredient - Unagi. The tubs of live eel sat in a corner, and behind the tables, off its side, a glass wall separated the diners from the chefs. You could watch clearly as the chefs efficiently ambit gruesomely prepared your meal from literal start to finish. BBQ-Ed in the spot, the skin is crusty, with a caramelized surface that hides a flaky interior. The meat is succulent with a strong smoky taste far from what you enjoy when you eat store bought Unagi. I enjoyed it, but I won\'t necessarily come back, might take a while before I  feel strong enough to watch my dinner being slaughtered in front of me. Haha
Fresh and alive unagi that are grilled on the spot and comes with fresh wasabi for you to grate. Wish they used traditional sharkskin grater instead of the metal ones. Overall experience 9/10. Another one of Teppei\'s great joints.
Add the garnishing like the seaweed and spring onions. \n<br />2nd: Scoop out some rice and unagi into the given bowl. Add the wasabi which you can shave by yourself and accompanying sauces from the table top.\n<br />3rd: Scoop out some rice and unagi into the given bowl. Pour in the dashi stock and slurp it.\n<br />Personally I enjoyed eating my unagi the original taste. But when soaked in the soup, together with the rice, it was delicious too.\n<br />🔅\n<br />I have finally been to Man Man.\n<br />Surely cannot 慢慢\n<br />Or else the unagi all bye bye\n<br />🔅\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋 Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant\n<br />💰$26.80\n<br />🍴1 Keong Saik Road #01-01 Singapore
If you hate blood/ smell of fish, pls do not sit by the viewing window. They slaughter the unagi live in front of you. (only for the strong hearted). Unagi Don is really yummy! Unagi with slight crisp at the sides and nice sauce which made me regret getting the smallest size. The egg is just so-so. (Tip: go during off peak periods like 8.30pm weekdays so you don\'t have to queue)
The elusive eel liver because they\'re always sold out, a friend came 40 mins after doors opened but was already too late for it!\n<br />🔸\n<br />It\'s precious because 6 to 7 eels are needed for this small bowl of liver. There\'s resemblance in taste to other forms of liver (pig, chicken, goose), but this is smooth and tastes clean. My preferred way of eating this is to mix it with rice and/or unagi.\n<br />🔸\n<br />If you made it to be in the first wave of patrons, order one and see if it\'s your kind of thing!
It\'s good, so good that one don\'t have to fly all the way to the Land of the Raising Sun for your Unagi fix. 🎏\n<br />•\n<br />The Unagi here is a Steal, especially at such an Affordable Price Point. Firstly, only live eels imported from the Mikawa Isshiki region is served upon order. 🗾\n<br />Only Fresh Wasabi is served which allows one to grate their desired amount while most restaurants serve fake horseradish Sh*t with colouring. 🖕🏻 Plus there\'s a VAST difference between freshly grated Wasabi &amp; the other Sh*t. •\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Opt for the Counter Seats &amp; watch Chef Nakagawa who helms the Charcoal Grilling &amp; Cutting station, a true 職人 (Shokunin)\n<br />Order the Hitusumabushi (💵S$26.80) to be eaten in 3 ways or with Eel Liver which almost rival Foie Gras. 😋\n<br />Already planning my next visit when I book out. 🖖🏻
Loving this place. I\'ve been here twice cos I was sold by the fresh eel and the perfect charcoal grill resulting in crispy and smoky skin. I\'ve also brought non-unagi lovers here and so far all have love it.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The hitsumabushi is one dish enjoyed three ways - first, just the unagi and with the plump rice; second, grate your own fresh wasabi and mix in seaweed and spring onions; third, pour in the dashi stock and make it an ochazuke.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Best time to visit? When we went on a Thursday afternoon at 2pm, there\'s no queue and we have the whole restaurant to ourselves.
Pick a counter seat if you want to be part of the spectacle where the chef skillfully grill your unagi. The chef frequently fans the grill, firing up the charcoal to achieve that crispy char on each slice of unagi.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Be warned that you may also watch the cutting of eel, and seeing how that white slices of fresh eel meat finally appears on your table :)
Divide the bowl into 3 portions. The first portion to be eaten with chopped spring onions and dried seaweed; the second with unagi sauce and freshly grated wasabi; pour the provided dashi stock into the bowl and enjoy the last portion like porridge. The unagi portions are generous and well grilled - the soft flesh contrasts with the crispy bits; eating it with the suggested methods gives you 3 vastly different experiences with 1 dish. How good is it? I was there 2 times in 4 days. Enough said. \n<br />#burpple #manmansg
I have never been one to like wasabi but the freshly grated wasabi is so gooooooddddddd. Broiled over charcoal, you taste the sweet flesh with a hint of smoke. The small sprinkle of salt intensifies the flavor and the charred bits were really fun when you bite into the soft and fatty unagi. So good, I am back the second time tonight. #burpple #manmansg
Tender and well grilled served with savoury sweet sauce. Read my review at http://bit.ly/2euIl4E   #unagi
Been craving this dish from Nagoya since my last meal at Honten Horaiken.  This version was definitely decent, just not quite as smoky as the one at Horaiken.
Here\'s featuring the una-don with tamagoyaki ($25.80) from the newly opened Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant located at Keong Saik Road! \n<br />Did I mention that the eels, sourced from the Isshiki town of Mikawa Bay will be prepared fresh on the spot upon ordering? FRESHNESS at its best here at Man Man Unagi!
Time to join the queue for LIVE preparation of unagi! \n<br />The standard unagi-don ranges from small to large size ($19.60 to $33.80), and I say either you go big or go home. It comes with tamagoyaki and pickles and takeaway option is available. The chunky unagi was perfectly grilled with charred and crispy exterior, and the freshness of the unagi was incredible. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Nestled behind The Working Capitol (access via the entrance facing the park), Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant specialises in charcoal grilled unagi. The new concept brought in by Teppei Group of Restaurants sees live unagi prepared a la order, so this is as fresh as it gets. Come with a group of friends and start your meal with the Umaki ($15.80) — egg omelette rolled with Japanese eel. The Una Don ($18.60) is a great introduction to unagi, but what we suggest you order is the Hitsumabushi ($26.80). Instead of the usual slab of unagi, it comes with unagi slices over a bed of rice, served with pickles, garnishes, a jar of bonito stock and an empty bowl. You can have the charcoal grilled unagi on its own first, but we recommend scooping out some of the rice and unagi into the empty bowl and adding in the soup stock to enhance the taste of the unagi! Oishii!\n<br />Pro tip: If you\'re not squeamish about blood, opt to sit in front of the glass kitchen, where you get to see Chef Nakagawa slicing and skewering the live, wriggling eels with ease.\n<br />Avg Price: $30 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler John Kuan

Grilled, smoky, freshly grilled unagi that was also skinned right before our eyes 😭 the freshness makes all the difference but how sad. Thanks to Teppei-san for the preview of his new unagi-focused joint.
Head down to the newest Teppei franchise Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant which specializes in live unagi. The unagi will be filleted right before your eyes 😱 so prepare yourself if you can\'t handle the scene. \n<br />As expected, the unagi is so fresh, it leaves no fishy aftertaste and the slightly caramelized sauce from the grill heightens the flavor of the dish. The dish I have ordered, Hitsumabushi ($26.90), is one of the top dish on the menu, which is essentially a chazuke style of the unagi don and it was amazing! 😋 The dashi broth was slightly salty and it pairs incredibly well with the unagi. If you are a fan of chazuke, you will want to give this a shot. \n<br />Do note that the restaurant is quite obscure as it\'s hidden behind The Working Capital near the underground connector. #burpple
The Hitsumabushi set comes with a well balanced amount of grilled glazed unagi and rice so that you can portion out the chazuke style nicely. Try out the Hitsumabushi ($26.80) at the newly opened Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant!
Thanks to Teppei for the opening night preview of his new unagi specialty restaurant!

😍😋In order to be the first batch to enter you would have to arrive half an hr before opening 6pm. I arrived at 5.50pm and waited for 85 mins. -\n<br />So this is how fresh unagi taste like and grilled to be crispy outside. Prices ranges from $20plus to $30plus (1 person serving) depending on the portion of unagi. Would think that Unagi is generally expensive and i would gladly pay this price for freshly grilled unagi. Favourite has gotta be the Kimo Don $27.30+ 👆🏻was skeptical initially, but i actually love the Kimoyaki (unagi liver) more than the unagi meat. \n<br />Sit at the bar counter and you can watch how your unagi is being prepared. 👨🏻‍🍳🔪\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #eathealthy #burpple  #dinner #sgdinner #japanese #japanesefood #unagi #teppei #fish #unagidon

heng today was quite fast 😃 &gt;\n<br />unagi (of cos) on a bed of rice, pickles, soup and dashi stock. \n<br />4 ways to savour: on its own, with spices (grate the wasabi yourself), with sauces (spicy, unagi, sweet) and/or pour in the dashi stock to make it like porridge. personally, I like on its own with more unagi sauce. \n<br />cleaned off every bit as u can see.

Possibly the best bowl of unagi in Singapore. Chargrilled to perfection, with lovely crisp that adds a crunch on every bite, yet ever so tender on the inside. There are 3 ways you can enjoy this awesomeness, and I can\'t choose my favourite. Is it with wasabi/negi or with some of that amazing dashi? You tell me. \n<br />My only regret - not getting the large version. Those reviews weren\'t lying - you\'re gonna want more of that unagi.  \n<br />Go at lunch - the queues are more manageable. 
Probably the longest I\'ve ever queued for a restaurant in Singapore - 2 hours! #unagi #unagidon #hitsumabushi #michelinguide #michelinstar
Had their signature Hitsumabushi ($26.80) - there\'s 3 ways of eating without sauce, with sauce (chili, unagi, sweet ) &amp; soak with their soup. Q-ed for almost an hour no doubt its raining this evening... Its fresh &amp; tasty but the Tamago ($12.80 for 3pieces) not so gd quite dry...

Freshwater eel grilled till perfection over charcoal fire. I would recommend bringing umbrella, water and a portable fan ever since they made it to the Michelin Bib Gourmand 2017.

Officially my favourite Unagi restaurant!!!\n<br />The Unagi doesnt get any fresher than this!\n<br />Served with fresh wasabi (YUMMY! The only kind of wasabi i\'ll eat), broth and pickles. There are some condiments by the side. Remember to try them out!

I love the ochazuke method with good quality Tsuyahime rice from Yamanashi :) 😍 itadakimasu~ #queueforgoodfood #foodporn #ilovejapanesefood #suntoryblack #burpple
The only place to go for every Unagi lover ☺️
Definitely worth every penny
Reward yourself at this newly minted Michelin bib gourmand 2017 restaurant. Friendly advice: come early if you can to beat the crowd! That last photo taken on a Friday night at about 645pm. 45minutes before opening time should be able to get you the first seating for dinner. But if you can\'t, always remember that patience rewards! 💪🏻 #igfood #igeats #foodislove #foodie #hungrygowhere #burpple #burppleSG #wte #whattoeat #sgfood #sgeats #igsgfood #igsgeats #eatoutsg #foodsg #instafood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instafoodie #singapore #yummy #exploreflavours #exploresingaporeeats #honestreviews #shotwithaniphone #iphonewarrior #unagi #michelin

is this for real or for reel.? This, is no hype. It\'s good,delicious and although it\'s expensive, there wasn\'t any regret. With its charred crispy skin and flakey-firm tasty meat, this is a must-try for fans or even non fans for unagi.!☝🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#manmanjapaneseunagirestaurant#unagi#eel#manmanunagi#japanesefood#qq#bibgourmand2017#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#bibgourmandsg#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#fusionfood#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#STFoodtrending
Though price is alittle steep, for a quality Unagi, this place is definitely a place to go. But not for any friends outing, cuz u can\'t get seat and order first even if its ur turn and your friend are coming in 2min. So after 2 min, they arrange you to sit separately. Not willing to help u arrange the seats. Service wise, i would rate negative. You paid restaurant price and get Cha chaan teng service? 👍🏻2/5 (wanted to rate 5 for the food, but thinking of the poor service we got for the price we paid, we probably wouldnt like to return back)\n<br />📍1 Keong Saik Road, #01-01, Singapore 089109 #yybffoutrampark

Crew shares about 3 types of eating methods. Unagi is tender, baby squid is juicy and tender. Sauces makes the dish even yummier. You get to grate ur own wasabi as well. Worth paying dor experiences and quality food here!
First time trying Unagi liver and it taste like grilled octopus.
But this is too good not to wait.
Feed your eyes and tummy with unagi; Watch the live unagi grilled before your eyes. Undeniable one of the best unagi in Singapore and you can even grind fresh wasabi for your meal. However they come with a \"price\"; 2 hours plus of queuing for weekend dinner. Question is, will you revisit? For me, yes definitely, for good food.

Unagi don in charred perfection, smokey fragrance in every bite. Yet the key question is, will I do it again? #foodporn #foodpornsg #burpple #burpplesg #manmanunagi
But be prepared to wait in queue especially on a #fridaynight. If you have been patient enough to get in, why not try this as well!

•\n<br />Thursday\'s morning is made up of dreaming about drizzling unagi sauce on this bowl filled with a super generous portion of unagi. 💭\n<br />•\n<br />#ig #igsg #sgfood #food #unagi #unagidon #manmanjapaneseunagirestaurant #totallyworththe1hourqueue #japanese #japanfood #eel #sharingiscaring #shouldhaveorderedlargeinstead #tamago #tamagi #sogood #burpple
Yummy eel with a nice char both for the crunch and the smoky flavour. $26.80. I asked for less rice and when it came I was telling my friend I regret asking for less. But now that I\'ve finished and left I actually feel really full (and sleepy) 😂
Die die must try! #sgfoodie #whati8today #burpple
Still prefer the Hitsumabushi which comes with the dashi broth 😛
Have always been a believer of \'never too busy to eat something quick\' but somehow ended up skipping #lunch today (well I did eat lovely #Japanese #cake and #Greek #chocolate travel souvenirs from colleagues instead haha)... what is happening to me?! Lol. 😝\n<br />#food #foodie #dinner #yummy #unadon #donburi #burpple #sgfoodpics #instafood
SG\'s best unagi, hands down! Generous chunks of unagi that\'s grilled to perfection, soft and crispy and sitting innocently upon \'em Japanese rice laden with sweet unagi sauce! It\'s r-eel-y good!! Just a heads up though, Man Man really do live up to their name, the queue is really 慢慢.
Didn\'t Q &amp; even got a neat window seat because went @ 2:15pm; 15 mins b4 last order for lunch. Basically, it\'s a Unagi Don with Spices &amp; Dashi. We are told to eat it in 4 ways but I\'ll spare you the deets cos it\'s written all over @instagram by everyone else yah.  Best meal of 2017?

all thanks to some grazer on her date night who took eternity to finish her meal, it was obvious her companion was bored stiff. #somuchhate but luckily the company was good. can\'t help but starting to think this place is overrated. #meh #igsg #sgig #vsco #vscocam #vscosg #igfood #sgfood #burpple

U-turn back on our first attempt and managed to get into the restaurant for the firt round on our 2nd visit. Tried the all-hyped hitsumabushi, i would say the unagi is really grilled to perfection with the right proportion of marination and grill time. The 3 ways of eating is an eye-opener to me!

You can choose to have the unagi with just the Japanese rice or garnish it with the seasoning items such as spring onions, wasabi and seaweed or pour in the pot of dashi (Unagi bone bonito stock) into the rice bowl to make a ochazuke\n<br />Apparently this is the traditional Japanese way to savour this dish
Another way to enjoy the Eel is the Shirayaki($27.80), here, the eel is presented naked. Cooked over bincho tan of course, but sans the distraction of sweet marinade with only Himalayan pink sea salt or freshly grated wasabi to enhance its persona. A must have for the purist.
New unagi specialty shop by Teppei is awesome. \n<br />Review on the blog!\n<br />#unagi #eel #grilledeel #manmanunagi #teppei #japanese #japanesefood #unagidon #sgfoodie #sgfood #lunchtime #lunch #foodiegram #foodiesg #foodie #instafood_sg #instafoodie #instafood #sgeatout #eatoutsg #foodstagram #charcoalgrilled #burpplesg #burpple
Not overly salty, almost creamy, this was an absolute joy to eat. I almost finished the entire portion unknowingly! #burpple #manmansg #teppei
This is the medium one. It comes with unagi, rice, tomagoyaki, pickles and soup. .\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #unagi #japanesefood
Meanwhile, here\'s a little #foodporn to kick start the Monday: The Unatama ($18.60) is deeply satisfying. The slight char from double dipping and caramelisation over intense flames resulting in a great juxtaposition to the intrinsic creaminess of the unagi flesh. The white charcoal producing such spell-binding temperatures that the soft bones that usually result in an unpleasant crunch in supermarket bought varietals, miraculously \"vanish\". Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant opens at 11 30am for lunch service today so do hike down for a meal of pleasantries.
My favorite way to enjoy unagi bowl. Scoop a spoonful of unagi and rice into a separate bowl, top it up with wasabi, seaweed &amp; spring onion, finishing it with warm dashi broth. Love the crispness of the grilled unagi. Will definitely return. This fondly reminds me of Japan !\n<br />⭐️: 🌝🌝🌝🌝\n<br />📍Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant\n<br />1 Keong Saik Road #01-01 🇸🇬Singapore 089109\n<br />⏰Lunch 11:30am – 3:00pm Last order 2:30pm,\n<br />Dinner 6:00pm – 10:30pm (Mon – Sat), Closed Sun, PH\n<br />.\n<br />#sgwanderlust #sgig #igsg #sgfoodblogger #igfood #instafood_sg #food #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #foodpic #burpple #hungrygowhere #yelpsg #unagidon #sgjapanese #japanesefood #sgfood #sgeats #sgfoodie #instafoodie #wanderlust #teppei #keongsiak

Super fresh and good!
Want the freshest unagi? Head down to the newest Teppei franchise Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant which specializes in live unagi. The unagi will be filleted right before your eyes 😱 so prepare yourself if you can\'t handle the scene. \n<br />As expected, the unagi is so fresh, it leaves no fishy aftertaste and the slightly caramelized sauce from the grill heightens the flavor of the dish. The dish I have ordered, Hitsumabushi ($26.90), is one of the top dish on the menu, which is essentially a chazuke style of the unagi don and it was amazing! 😋 The dashi broth was slightly salty and it pairs incredibly well with the unagi. If you are a fan of chazuke, you will want to give this a shot. \n<br />Do note that the restaurant is quite obscure as it\'s hidden behind The Working Capital near the underground connector.
