Because nowadays #simisaialsocharcoal. \n<br />The delicate flakes of codfish were so subtle and fresh, and the extra crunch of the thin charcoal crust will make you swoon. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
New wave of charcoal is gently hitting the island. New sexy colour replacing the old school golden brown. Sadly, taste wise is just ordinary. Came here with no expectations and left with not much satisfaction. Food was decent and right so much so there\'s nothing else to say.
Another new place around NUS (Science Park behind Prince George\'s Park Residence) with industrial-themed interior that sells some Western affair. It\'s a pretty cool ambience especially with the alfresco area which will help upping your Instagram game during the day. It\'s a decent 3-course lunch, consisting of soup, starter and mains. This was the Braised Oxtail that came with mushroom and mashed potato. A hearty portion and the oxtail was done right -- tender and pretty juicy. I can\'t fault this dish but perhaps more spinach (hidden in the bottom) will be better for me. At this price, the lunch set seemed affordable and sufficient to get you through the long campus or office hour.
It has brownie, vanilla ice cream, chocolate fudge base and chocolate syrup. All stuffed into a single jar, getting ready for a chocolate coma! @thepipedistrict
We even finish their sauce! ü§§

Dip it in tartar sauce or malt vinegar to add that zestyness.\n<br />Choose normal fries or green salad as your side and finally order their signature freakshakes and charcoal ocean calamari to go along!
Or has the chef mistimed the frying and it is served burnt? Do not fret, it is just charcoal battered calamari. There is also charcoal battered onion rings that you can order as well.\n<br />These fried delights are fantastic bites on their own but when dipped in the sharp and piquant wasabi mayo, you will relish the sensation of the bright green sauce that is so thick, creamy and immensely sharp and caustic that you either love it or loathe it.
Delicate and rip roaringly candied, you do not need to be green with envy or launch an angry tirate to enjoy gratification with this decadence.
It is delicious, sweet, creamy but not too much. It has very complex flavour and texture and will be sure to amaze your taste budüòã\n<br />.\n<br />The Hulk at S$8*\n<br />.\n<br />Read on foodgem.sg/travel/singapore/west/the-pipe-district\n<br />.\n<br />On a side track, The Pipe District is offering Christmas specialsüéÑ For readers who book and quote foodgem, you will be entitled for 10% off The Pipe District Christmas specials.\n<br />.\n<br />Where to order? \n<br />The Pipe District\n<br />45 Science Park Road (The Gemini) #01-09/10, Singapore 117407\n<br />Contact: +65 6873 0143\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#thepipedistrict #bistro #milkshake #dessertlover #christmas2016 #singaporefood #sginstagram #sgfoodporn #sgfood #sgblogger #sgfoodblogger #sgeats #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #foodsg #whati8today #hungrygowhere #burpple #instasg #visitsingapore #sgig #igsg #vscosg #sgvsco

Charcoal fish &amp; chips and Squid Ink Risotto at extremely affordable prices and tasty for the prices. Didn\'t recognise the ex-Poulet Executive Chef at all and that\'s so strange but whatever it is, you did well! üëçüèº #throwback #vscocam #allthingsblack #8dayseatout #throwback #foodvsco #pipedistrict #sciencepark #hungrygowhere #burpple #straitstimeslife #openricesg #onthetable #sgfood #sgfoodies #igsg #sgig #sgigfoodies
