Wish it was a little more dense. Flat White\'s acidity level was pretty high. And they have really good Spotify playlist. I can sit there all day listening to the songs.
Settled at Foxhole Cafe for brunch, where The Pourover Bar is also located after its move out of Ollella at Farrer Park.
Apart from croissant sandwiches and other hot food, Foxhole Cafe also serves a variety of cakes and pastries as well. Quite liked this orange Drizzle cake which perfumes lightly of citrusy zinginess, while pretty light in terms of texture and coated with a rather thick sugary glaze over the top. A little pricey at $7.90 before service charge though.
Pretty much the combination that cannot go too wrong ‚Äî the same buttery and flaky Croissant used in their Signature Croissant with Chili Crab Meat but comes with melted cheese and ham with an addition of cherry tomatoes for a burst of tangy juiciness. No doubt satiating and comforting; comes with Raspberry Chips that starts off with slight sweet and zingy flavour similar to those of Raspberry nibs in granola while ending off with the salted flavours of potato chips for the finish.
Probably created for the \"gram\" especially for how it comes in this giant-sized Yakult-esque bottle. A concoction of Yakult and soda, the drink starts off with the familiar flavours of prebiotic yogurt drinks with a 7Up/Sprite taste at the end. The flavour is pretty subjective here; some may find it pretty similar to medicine depending on what you one had been through in their childhood.

ü¶ä I ordered the Carbonara. üçù My first reaction to that was how come portion so small? :( The presentation looks good with the poached egg in the middle. The sauce could have been more creamy and also be more generous in their portion size. You can sit by the window and admire the view outside. It overlooks a huge field. #feedthetheme ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚†Ä ‚ú®#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower

No need for me to go to the CBD area for a satisfying caffeine fix. This place is also really quiet, so you can have a quaint peaceful weekend chillin with a book. Also got a blueberry muffin and it aptly compliments my coffee

Barely any ü¶Ä. Foxhole Yakult Lover ($6.90) - EXPENSIVE. Comes in a gram-worthy giant Yakult bottle but taste wise was disappointing too. Just Yakult and cream soda ü§• #burpple #dqky

Chilli Crab Croissant ($14.90 nett)
In case you are wondering, this is a mega size of yakult soda üíÅ\n<br />So business was so good today that they ran out of change and dessert selections üò®
A little pricey but the buttery pastry came with thick slices of smoked salmon and luscious lettuce. Chips were served together with a tinge of unique raspberry flavour.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #sgeats #instasg #instafood #instafoodsg #sgig #sginstagram #burpple #foodsg #foodporn #foodgasm #foxholecafesg #smokedsalmon #croissant #flatwhite #cafehopping #hougang
Located at The Midtown Residences (formerly Hougang Plaza) the cafe exudes a warm and cosy vibe. Perfect for an afternoon read or simply just to lay back and chill.\n<br />üî∂\n<br />You can\'t go wrong with the Chilli Crab Croissant ($14.90). The crisp buttery pastry is packed full of real crab meat, diced hardboiled egg in a sweet and spicy chilli crab sauce that has added chilli padi for that spice kick towards the end.\n<br />üî∂\n<br />Order the refreshing and fizzy Yakult Soda ($6.90) that is served in a big yakult bottle that is totally instagrammable.\n<br />üî∂\n<br />The Foxhole Cafe also houses The Pourover Bar where you can grab a cuppa from. Take your pick from their extensive range of specialty coffee beans that are sourced from various countries.\n<br />üî∂\n<br />#sgeats #tslmakan #burpple #8dayseat #sgcafehopping #thegrowingbelly #stfoodtrending #steats #igeats #sgig #igsg #instasg #sgfoodies #sgcafes #hougangcafes #foxholecafe #foodporn
