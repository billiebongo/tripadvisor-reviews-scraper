These satisfying and affordable burgers were quite soul-snatching, with prices ranging from $4.50 to $6.50 per burger.
Helmed by three young hawkerpreneurs, this Muslim-owned stall in Golden Mile Food Centre offers a sizeable range of affordable gourmet halal burgers. The beef options fared decently with their juicy patties, but their Country Fried Chicken Burger ($5) stood out for us. A glorious piece of fried chicken comes topped with a refreshing slaw, an oozy sunny side-up and sandwiched between grilled buns made in-house. Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua akins the chicken to your typical Taiwanese Chicken Cutlet, so you know you\'re getting the good stuff. All burgers come with fries (top up $1 for onion rings), and is guaranteed to fill you up despite its deceptively small appearance. Dining in a group? Share their signature Honey Soy Fried Chicken Wings ($4.90 for six) that reminded us of Korean fried chicken, glazed in honey soy sauce and topped with spring onions and sesame seeds. Bang for your buck? We think so. \n<br />Avg Price: $5 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
The Classic Burger from Project Warung (a hawker stall at Golden Mile Food Centre) will only set you back by $4.50 (!!) and that includes fries or top up $1 for onion rings! \n<br />The beef patty is really legit and really well grilled and definitely value for money! We also loved the Country Fried Chicken Burger ($5!!) - for a more saucy treat!
All the burgers here were very very value for money (avg $5 for a burger with fries, add $1 to change to onion rings), and the beef patty was surprisingly thick and juicy üëçüèª Nothing mushroomy about this burger aside from the random appearance of the deep fried oyster mushroom, though it provided a welcome change in texture; crunchiness in contrast with the yumzers patty.
From Burgz by Project Warung; a new  Muslim-owned stall opened by young hawkerpreneurs at Golden Mile Food Centre serving gourmet burgers and affordable prices ‚Äî there\'s quite a range of chicken and beef burgers to choose from; this only costs $5, with fries! (psst; there is a Burg\'s Seoul Fried Chicken Burger at $4.50 too with fries as well)
So worth the calories. üòã My only advice is to GO EARLY cos they sell out so fast! #burgs .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgigfoodies #burpple #sgfood #halalsg #burgers #instagood #vscocam #vsco #igsg #instadaily
As much as I enjoyed the crunch of the piece of fried chicken, it was a tad too dry overall - unlike a better proportion of sauce used in their Teriyaki Chicken Burger ($5.50). Portion was smaller than what we expected too and we thought our second burger was much more value for money for its quantity!
With honey soy sauce, homemade mayonnaise and bonito flakes. The combination was surprisingly good!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_burgsbyprojectwarung #hgfoodie_armymarket #armymarket #burgsbyprojectwarung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
But the chicken burgers were sold out by the time we were there. Had to make do with the ebi burger for myself, and hickory pulled beef brisket ($5.50) for bf. The ebi wasn\'t in a patty, but just 2 tempura ebi. I thought it wasn\'t worth $4.90 (which comes with the fries). But the addition of sunny side up (50 cents) was a good idea! I love gooey egg yolks~~ üòä However, the chilli sauce had a funny weird indianspicetastesmell which ruined the French fries for me üòÖ #projectwarung #burpplesg #burpple #burpplesghawkerfare #goldenmilefoodcentre
Char-grilled marinated chicken thigh, sesame coleslaw, sunny side up egg and bonito flakes. It was sold out the last time we were there and I can see why. It was an interesting and yummy combination.\n<br />*\n<br />It was sold out again after we collected our burgers!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_burgsbyprojectwarung #hgfoodie_armymarket #burgsbyprojectwarung #armymarket #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Tasted better and definitely good value for $4.50 plus $0.50 for the extra cheese.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_burgsbyprojectwarung #hgfoodie_armymarket #burgsbyprojectwarung #armymarket #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Irresistible \"Ebi prawn burger\"  Burgs by @projectwarung üçîüî•\n<br />*****\n<br />Heard about this burger joint for some time. Just got a chance to be in the Golden Mile food center area and check them out!üëäüôå\n<br />.\n<br />Ordered 2 takeaway sets \n<br />* The Classics $4.5 ü§ò\n<br />Beef patty, caramelised onion, American cheese, pickled green chilli üßÄ\n<br />* The Ebi prawn burger $4.90\n<br />Japanese tempura prawn, Homemade coleslaw, sweet Chilli mayonnaise üç§\n<br />P.S. add $1 for takeaway üõç\n<br />.\n<br />All burgers come with fries but for something fanciful like cheese fries $3.5, seaweed fries $3, Okonomi fries $3.5, etc. You can of course top up. We absolutely love the taste of these 2 burgers. The classics got all the flavours especially the ebi prawn is still crunchy after half an hour commuting time! üòÜ Definitely our most favourite great value burger in SG!! üëçüëçüëç \n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />üìçBURGS by Project Warung (11 am-1:30pm)\n<br />505 Beach Road, Golden Mile food Centre \n<br />#B1-24 S199583\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burgs #projectwarung #goldenmile #foodcenter #burgerjoint #burgerlover #sgfood #instafood #sgfoodie #foodblogger #halal #halalfood #valueeat #burpple #weekendeat #localeats #singaporefood #singaporeeats
Served in a metal basket with the burger looking so hipster and here\'s the best part, two classics(one with additional sunny side up)for $11? You serious? Yup i am dead serious.Swapped the normal fries to okonomi. What\'s not to love about it? Affordable and presentable.
Surprisingly nice and at an affordable price..
$4.50 it\'s certainly a steal!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#hamburger#cheeseburger#projectwarung#cafesg#burgs#foodie#eatsg#delicious#burgsbyprojectwarung#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#makanwarriortour#STFoodtrending
It also comes served with fries as sides that is sure to make the meal even more filling, while also being friendly on the wallet at only $5!
A Muslim owned company helmed by 3 young chefs, Ridz Uan, Lee Syafiq and M Shah Indra. The 3 friends are committed to serving quality halal burgers at affordable prices. Each bun is professionally seared with the Burgs\' logo.\n<br />*\n<br />Get there early as there is perpetually a long queue. We arrived a little after 12pm on National Day and had to queue for half an hour before we could order and it was another half an hour of waiting before our food was ready! The teriyaki chicken burger was already sold out by the time it was our turn to order üò≠.\n<br />*\n<br />After queuing for so long, we ordered every available burger üòÇ - double classic beef burger, hickory smoked beef brisket burger, Seoul fried chicken burger and ebi prawn burger.\n<br />*\n<br />The double classic had the most potential and is definitely value for money at $7. It was served with caramelised onions, American cheese and pickled green chilli.\n<br />*\n<br />If you like pulled meat burgers, you will like the beef brisket burger priced at $5.50. With homemade BBQ sauce and homemade coleslaw.\n<br />*\n<br />We ordered chicken wings as well. As you can see, we were determined to make sure that our long wait was worth the while. We had both the non spicy honey soy and the spicy Korean style. I preferred the latter as it had more \'oomph\'.\n<br />*\n<br />I am not sure I will queue for an hour but would definitely like to try the teriyaki chicken burger if the queue was palatable.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_burgsbyprojectwarung #burgsbyprojectwarung #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Wanted to get the beef brisket but they ran out, so we got the classic beef and terriyaki chicken! There wasn\'t anything very special about the classic beef, but the terriyaki chicken was a much better deal with the sunny side up and bonito flakes! \n<br />#jiaklocal #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #burpple #burpplesg #burgers #projectwarang #sgfood #sgeats #sgfoodie #igsg #whati8today #sghawker
Budget but nice mini gourmet burgers
Total damage? Only SGD 5.50 for this quality gourmet burger. üçî
