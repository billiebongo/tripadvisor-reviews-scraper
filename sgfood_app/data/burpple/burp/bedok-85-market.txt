If u love cockles, try this hot plate sambal chilli cockles. Hassle free choice and yet satisfying cravings! 
I like how this plate of omelette has substantial amount of eggs and not being overly starchy. However, I only eat the omelette without the oysters but my friends commented that the oysters were undercooked so all the oysters were left on the plate „Äã$3
Well marinated ‚Äãcharcoal grilled ‚Äãsatays with nice smoky flavour. Satays are nicely grilled without overly charred. I preferred the chicken satays coz the meat is much tender but overall, I feel both are nice.
Thoroughly enjoyed the rich and aromatic stock and every mouthful was well-drenched. 3 different types of noodles were fried evenly and complemented each other! \n<br />And yes, I am a fan of the wet version.
LOL. But still makes good supper food lah #reasonstoeat
..\n<br />Will always remember the good old times when we can always gather at market 85 after trainings for a good meal! Those times were definitely the best!üòå\n<br />..\n<br />..\n<br />üì∑: @seakrets\n<br />Hashtag sgfoodiary to share your love for food with our food community and get a chance to be featured right now!\n<br />..\n<br />..
The infamous Bedok 85 Market where many local delicacies congregate at one place. Was here on a weekday and all food was served quickly. Satay, Bar chor mee (fav store is Ah Poh instead of the usual 2 famous stores) and chicken wings are the must order for me! Ordered the stingray and lala from Chan BBQ. But honestly, standard dropped a lot and prices had gone up! Used to be $8 each for a small stingray and lala but now $10. Lala barely found much. Still prefer chomp chomp but not opened today. Hidden gem is the claypot. It\'s located at the third back row where usually shops are closed in the evening. The ginger spring onion sliced fish and pork are worth the try!
From Chomp Chomp BBQ. Apparently I am always in the mood for BBQ Stingray at the Bedok 85 market; perhaps it\'s just the way how the market smells that makes it so intriguing. Loved how flaky and smoky this one was without being too wet. The chili could have been spicier to increase the shiok factor but guess it was made this way to enable us to savour the fish as well, which makes it only better after every single morsel.
From Lin Yuan Satay at the Bedok 85 market. Meat was well-marinated, achieving a consistent flavour profile with smoky flavour though some places have a stronger marinade. What was the winning point was the great balance of fatty and lean meat so there is never once that you would feel tired from chewing, not feeling sick of the jelly-like fats.
Part of our dinner tonight at Fengshan Hawker Centre. #yummy #foodiesg #burpple
Just a need for sambal Stingray! At this stall, chomp chomp seafood!
[Fengshan Market &amp; Food Centre] Hands up if you are someone who will order orh luak and only eat the omelette üôãüôãüôã. That someone is definitely me as the egg intrigues me more than the big juicy oysters. No matter if it\'s unhealthy or artery clogging, a plate of Oyster Omelette ($8) is okay once in awhile, even though I bet I ate only $3 worth of it.
[Fengshan Market &amp; Food Centre] How can you order sambal stingray without ordering a plate of Sambal Lala ($12) too? Together with a bowl of rice and a plate of green vegetables, we can get the feasting going. My usual order will be from Chan BBQ, but I am seeing more of such seafood stalls opening in the hawker centre. I am truly spoilt for choice here. 
[Fengshan Market &amp; Food Centre] The quintessential item to order when at \"Bedok 85\" is a hotplate of Sambal Stingray ($12). There are several stalls but my favourite has always been Chan BBQ, who has been at the same location for many years. Served on a banana leaf, I think it\'s more to help add aroma to the dish than aesthetic. With a squeeze of lime, it\'s time to feast. Make a dash for it before the weekends end.
Comfort food with hilarious company is the trick to clear my sky.
Always like dinner here. Had mixed porridge from Chai Chee Pork Porridge again, this time at bedok 85. Shiok - cuttlefish, pork and century egg, generous with ingredients I think! Carrot cake was awesome, crispy at the sides. Instead of orhluak we changed it to prawn (this was meh, maybe it\'s the prawns)
The only place people will order soup bar chor mee, porky soup, slippery noodles and pork balls and it\'s a must to add all that chili. But it wasn\'t spicy enough for me...
Apart from their ba chor mee, bedok 85\'s fried hokkien mee is surprisingly good too, the chili has the punch too!
Really fine ice snow toppee with almond pudding, longan and \"tadpoles\". Cheap simple and cooling!
Oh how I\'ve missed you, BBQ wings and oh lua üòç
So this is a typical 20 minute wait for supper. Was it worth the wait? It\'s comfort food for sure. Love the mince pork infused murky soup base. And for once, i could gladly skip the chilli padi. Keeping it simple! :)
Impromptu supper with friends is my favourite kind! Sadly, not as good, standard here seems to be inconsistent (or was it too late?)
Another favorite supper meal for many Singaporeans. The battle of the bar chor mee has been like fashion and music. To each to his own. So which is your favorite?
Chan BBQ makes the first BBQ sambal sotong I had that comes with pineapple chunks, and a unique mincey kinda sambal sauce. The sotong pieces are really huge too. Super yums
Chan BBQ is once again the only BBQ seafood stall I know of that prepares a prawn omelette this way: sambal prawns encased in the omelette, served on a hot plate. Absolutely yummy.
The steamed tapioca was soft enough, but we thought this seemed overly sweet because of the thick Gula Melaka at the bottom which couldn\'t mix with the coconut milk.
From a stall named Dim Sum Wang. Flowy sweet yet salty custard, though the Bao seemed a tad thick and dry. Still pretty decent for hawker standard though.
Came back here after seeing another fellow Burppler\'s burp here and just craved for it. The stingray is still tender, but the key is in their Sambal that seemed to had a tinge of Chinchalok; spicy, tangy and full of flavour
From a stall named Dim Sum Wang. Translucent skin was a wee bit thick, and the shrimp seemed a tad dry. Pretty standard fare actually.
Firmly packed with pork that was rather \"q\". One of the better items from the stall actually.
I have ate many versions of this dish and I gotta admit that this stall has the best sambal chili that I have ever tasted.
Sinful and delicious. This incredibly unhealthy food should be only ate like only every once in a while despite the fact that this is extremely tasty and yummy!
This must be the best in Singapore! Tender meat with a whiff of charcoal that causes you to yearn for more...and the chilli makes your taste buds go crazy!
Known as the best Ba Chor Mee (BCM) aka minced meat noodles, this hits the right spot when one needs some warming up on a cold &amp; chilly day! The tangy meatballs are juicy &amp; just right followed with slurping good soup! 
The stall is called Thiam kee. 
From the tze char stall call Yuanyuan. One of the best prawn paste chicken ive had. 
how disappointing when we found out there were only 3 oysters üò®üò≠
Back from Hong Kong! Sambal Stingray really hits the spot after not having anything spicy the entire trip #sgfood
and Seng Hiang Bak Chor Mee for the dry one!
always go for Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian for soup bak chor mee!
The raved Bedok 85 ba chor mee. The soup is good but other than that, nothing special. 
Â•Ω‰πÖ‰∏çËßÅ BEDOK 85: Â•Ω‰πÖÊ≤°ÂêÉ BBQ WINGS! Omg... When was the last time...
My dinner treats from my dearest #BLOOD03 and my idiotic boyfriend. #NoelPrye // had a sumptuous and bloated dinner at market with them after a long day in school. All th famous foods that everyone loves. #foodporn #Potd
1st time here after the renovation of the centre. Love the outdoor seats now! The place does feel more ventilated!
Muahaha yay finally, satisfy my cravings! S$2.50-S$3
Fried kway teow from 85 which costs $2.50 only! Pretty nice! ^^
Black carrot cake! Super yummy and it only costs $2.00 for this big portion
Overkill. $5 mixed carrot cake for 2 is definitely an overkill.

Generous servings of shredded chicken and mushroom are topped on kway teow tossed in sweet black sauce, drizzled with a hint of lard oil. Swatow Wanton Noodles has been operating since 1970s, changing hands from mother to daughter, but still serves up a great rendition of the traditional Ipoh Hor Fun ($3). Distinctly fragrant, definitely worth the while!

A 25 min wait just to eat this satay beehoon. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />So we ordered a big plate. Not very much beehoon but super generous with the ingredients aka cockles, taupok, lean meat, liver, water convolulus and peanut gravy. Thick gravy with a strong taste of peanuts and tiny bits of crushed peanuts gave it a bolder body. Quite slurpingly good. Not the bestest but definitely the better one if compared with others. But take heed, it was sold out by 8pm and the stall opened at 5pm. Amazing!!\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />A day of #jiaklocal to support our local hawkers.
What a way to end the night.

The pork chop was rather stale, hard to bite into and lacked of flavour.

Darn messy cup. 
Basically egg noodles in minced meat broth with porkballs. To be honest, a little lack in variety and served in quite a small bowl, but you can upsize it. I\'ve also heard from many that they\'re not as generous and good as compared to many years ago. Still, cheaper and without the bitter, chemical-like tastes of many I\'ve eaten at food centres. #bedok85 #sg #sgeats #sgfood #local #hawkerfood #food #foodie #yummy #delicious #cheap #burpplesg #burpple #foodgasm
It is best when grilled on charcoal, traditionally with fish meat and spices (spicy). Nowadays there are new flavors with squid, prawns, fishroe etc.. I like it best with my nasi lemak for brekkie. #bedok85 #sgeats #grill #sgfood #food #yummy #foodporn #instasg #fotd #foodgasm #otah #asian #cuisine #breakfast #delicious #burpple
My friend recommended that I should have this instead of BCM. I tried and I didn\'t quite like it. I feel that the sauce has a weird sweet and sour combination which doesn\'t quite suit my taste buds. I am regretting that I did not get my BCM „Äã$6.40

How about some Chai Chee Pork Porridge ($3, additional $0.50 for egg) for a start? I love this form of porridge whereby the rice bits are broken down into a good thick consistency after many hours of simmering. Cooked with fresh pork and meat balls, it\'s a simple yet comforting meal.\n<br />|\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link

2 bcm stalls situated next to each other, both of which have their own hardcore bcm fans. Personally, I prefer the \"Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian\" which serves soup-only bcm. Springy noodles w super tasty soup. Actually, if I\'m not mistaken,the secret to their soup lies in the little bits of lard. Only $2.50 for a small bowl or $3 for a large bowl! Be prepared to wait for 20-30 mins on busy nights. But trust me, it\'s worth the wait! üëç
