Love this dish! Nachos topped with minced char siew and cheese! A good sides for those who wants to have a drink to go with it
Pasta became a little \"sian\"... for someone who isn\'t a major fan of Hae Bi Hiam! But the chicken cutlet was alright! Though the sides were a little too hard, the mashed potatoes saved the dish! Wouldn\'t go back for these 2 dishes but overall good experience as the staff were friendly :) ALSO, dishes were kindda overpriced for us
Prawn hee bee hiam pasta and truffle floss fries!! üòç (the pasta sauce was slightly oily though)\n<br />.\n<br />And then I came home and collapsed infront of the laptop working for 4hours straight (and complaining to my fellow colleagues üôä. ROAR! So damn annoyedüôÖ ) #burpple
A supposed western twist on a local favourite, the foie gras aims to add a luxurious touch but unfortunately it\'s a little dry as is the pork belly. That being said, the pasta was GREAT. Cooked perfectly and it was coated well with the minced pork sauce.
Crunchy salad with fried tofu puffs and eggs before being drizzled with sweet kecap manis all nestled in a warm soft tortilla shell. This was definitely something worth going back for!
Steak and chinchalok a unique  combination (fusion between local taste and western), the steak is tender. Staff are attentive and friendly. \n<br />#BurppleXChope
Really liked the \'Bak Chor\' Foie Gras pasta ($18) which was tagliatelle tossed with a fragrant minced pork stew, topped with pork belly and a generous slab of #foiegras. For those who like some kick in their food, do try the Prawn and \'Hae Bi Hiam\' pasta ($17) which we enjoyed too! #burpple #burpplexchope
These fries were made for me! Char Siew is one of my favourite flavours and I never imagined it to be interpreted as a topping for fries in the form of a char siew ragout, with an added boost from jalape√±o salsa. This was shiok! Only downside was that there wasn\'t quite enough. #burppleXchope
Chicken thigh meat seasoned with evident hints of sesame flavor!!! Any non- chicken breast meat salads are in my radar so this was a great early dinner option as I was still full from late lunch!  \n<br />Definitely not doing my visit to the \"brainchild of DP architecture X Grub\" - Redpan justice, for the menu was filled with interesting fusion items! We shared a truffle floss fries (fries with truffle aioli, chicken floss and chives) which was great too so I can\'t wait to be back for more!
Essentially the pasta equivalent of a \"no, you hang up\"-sweet mee rebus and a particularly nutty satay bee hoon getting youthfully experimental in the stairwell of a school clock tower (inspired by a true story, folks - Junior College Gossip Correspondent). 3.6/5
Good way to end the meal..mini donuts topped with milo powder, condensed milk and chopped hazelnuts!
This never disappoints! Fries remained fairly crispy despite the drizzled char siew on top. Love it!
The cake looked dry but it was surprisingly quite moist and the cream cheese was good!
Nothing much to rave about. Pandan cake layers were soft and nice but the gula melaka coconut flavour could have been stronger to alleviate the taste of this cake.
I like how they are so generous with the floss toppings. Fries were crunchy and nice. The mayo added a good balance to the sweetness of the floss. YUM!
One of the best Swiss rolls I\'ve had. Better still cause it was matcha flavoured!
Tasted as the title described. Shoe-string truffle infused deep fried fries, with sporadic squirts of wasabi-ish mayo tt acted like the \"glue\" for the tossed chicken floss (so they could stick on top of the fries nicely), a lil\' sprinkle of flakey greens &amp; sesame seeds. Tasted good but I don\'t think is worth the $8.56 (ordered this through UberEATS), cos I believe I can recreate it at home? Hehe üê∂üê∂
The taste is awesome! Like a really BCM... But the foie gras is too small. Otherwise, thumbs up!
Think of this as the Chinese version of sticky date pudding. I\'m not fond of red dates, but this was quite intriguing.
As if banana balls weren\'t already indulgent enough on their own, these are made even more decadent with heaps of Milo, toasted hazelnuts and liberal drizzles of condensed milk. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the mix and we\'ve got a veritable cure for sweet tooth cravings.
Two piles of crispy, fluffy fries. One with truffle-infused garlic mayonnaise, chives, sesame seeds and a nest of chicken floss; the other with homemade barbecued pork, sour cream and jalape√±o salsa.
Like hae mee, but better. I just can\'t get enough of that spicy dried prawn paste!
Whilst the succulent mushroom juices solely carry the Bak Chor Mee concept and the tagliatelle had the hardened demeanour of a morning-shift Today newspaper distributor, the Kim Kardashian-esque molten wobble of the seared pork belly alone justifies the price of admission. 3.7/5
We love char siew. We love fries. This restaurant at Marina Square ingeniously combines them by garnishing nicely browned fries with a generous serving of saucy, housemade char siew ragout. Don\'t forget to mix in the spicy jalapeno salsa to spice up the Char Siew Chilli Fries ($7)! The convenient location, reasonable prices and tasty eats (read: \'Lup Cheong\' Macaroni and Cheese) make this the perfect place for a casual business lunch meeting, or a family meal after a day of shopping. Hankering for something sweet to end the meal? Opt for the Banana Donuts \'Milo Dinosaur\' ($7) ‚Äî gooey orbs with a goreng pisang centre, dusted with Milo powder!\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Geraldine Tay
Another restaurant with an asian touch to their palatable plates of cuisines. One of their chef recommendations would be this Prawn &amp; Hae Bi Hiam pasta. Upon dishing the plate of pasta to your table, the pasta perfumed with the fragrance of hae bi hiam whet up your appetite almost instantly. Al dente tagliatelle tossed in spicy shrimp paste gave the dish a local oomph and kick with the creamy spicy base. Portion was just nice, not too little and not too overwhelming.
Although it\'s nice, im not much of a chicken chop fan.. Would prefer the crispy bread crumbs. Anyway, can always rely over here to get your chicken chop fix which I find is quite good.
Bread crumbs is lovely fried and even. Chicken is crispy and tender and quite tasty. Mash potato tasted good too.. The only complain is that, where\'s the taste of the prawn paste..? 7.5/10
A new twist to pasta. This dish is a fusion btwn a local fare of hae bi hiam &amp; prawns and the western origin of pasta. I really love how it blends well and would totally go back the second time for it 
Hae Bi Hiam Pasta - somehow, there was something a little lacklustre in the dishes I had. The fusion element was more exciting than in theory than it turned out to be. Pasta\'s flavour was one dimensional &amp; a little too salty for my liking.
I gave this a try because of its creativity and also because I HEARTZ chinchalok. The 200g steak was well prepared, but too stingy on the chinchalok TBH. Seafood stalls serve tastier ones yo. A tint of surprise comes from the mashed potatoes, IKR?!
The cake was fluffy and moist with all the ondeh ondeh flavours! We loved the smooth blend of coconut buttercream, and the shredded coconut and gula melaka in between the fragrant pandan sponge cake. üòò It was good enough for us to \"tabao\" (takeaway) some home for our moms.
It\'s our familiar grilled chicken steaks with mushroom gravy. How nostalgic... but we\'d prefer the chicken chop to be more flavourful and homemade gravy to be richer in taste. üòÜ
I\'m not trying to pour cold water on those who like this Hainanese Pork Cutlet @ redpan but I think some neighbourhood food stalls can do even better. üôä
The crowd at Super Japan Matsuri was just too terrifying. We decided to go with Plan B - just get away from the massive human traffic and settle down for a good meal.
One thing I have particularly learnt about redpan over the two visits is that this is a safe option to dine at that provides food of a quality that quite resonates its pricing, so it still remains a good option to dine at despite slight misses in execution. The battered fish was seasoned with pepper and herbs before frying, which explains that peppery heat within though it felt just a wee bit overdone being slightly dry, though still pretty decent to have if one tries not to nitpick. Fries were crisp and pretty filled with potato, while the tartar sauce lies towards the sweeter side although still slightly tangy. The garden salad comes with an interesting floral-flavours dressing which is not particularly up to my fancy, though some might like it. Still some pretty decent grub at this price range that I would not mind paying for.
I wouldn\'t say that this is perfectly executed, but bearing in mind that redpan is a place that does pretty decent Singaporean-Western fusion dishes at a good price this matched up nicely to the price range. Seared Pork Belly served with a peppery Bak Kut Teh sauce, the pork belly came with considerable tenderness with quite a bit of fat so the meat is chewy with a good balance of lean meat and fatty parts. I did appreciate the fact that the had included fried dough fritters to further incorporate the local theme into the dish, but I didn\'t fancy the texture of the fried dough fritters that were stone-hard and more biscuity without that light chewiness within the insides; it wrestled hard with the fork and it was quite embarrassing I had a piece that decided it would be better ending up on the floor beside the next table than being stabbed by the fork. Coming with smashed potatoes, you get a bit of chunky bits around with slightly mashed up bits to bite, while the peppery Bak Kut Teh sauce did well to replicate that local flavour into the dish, making the flavours pretty spot on. Execution is not perfect here, but given the price point it achieves the desired flavour and quality pretty fine, with a touch of Singaporean flavours done with western cooking techniques.
Wanted to go for the Truffle Floss Fries initially but went for this instead for these instead realizing we already have fries for our Fish &amp; Chips. The fried calamari comes coated in a crisp golden brown batter, though the calamari felt a tad rubbery. What I loved though was the Sambal Mayo; nothing too over the top, but the mix of savoury, tangy and spicy flavours are definitely a hit with me so much I ended up dipping the fries into the Sambal Mayo dip rather than the Tartar sauce it comes default with. 
The former doesn\'t have the honeyed sweetness (thankfully) that one normally associates char siew with, but it is one flippin\' tasty ragout. \n<br />#burpple #redpansg #comfortfood
Only ginger lovers need apply. The root\'s sharp and delightfully pungent scent was pronounced, but doesn\'t overwhelm the vanilla-imbued pool of custard. Crackly crust is a score as well.
A \'special\' on their menu, this would be a modern take on one of my favourite local dishes - bak chor mee. Springy tagliatelle strands were tossed in a savoury &amp; slightly vinegary sauce, peppered with soft minced pork, pork belly, mushrooms, and atas-ified with foie gras. So lip-smackingly satisfying that we wasted no time in polishing it off.
Three simple ingredients: Macaroni, lup cheong (Chinese waxed sausage), cheesy Bechamel sauce are all that\'s needed to set off a party of flavours in the mouth. Decadent and highly comforting; tho I recommend you share this and leave some room to try other equally scrummy dishes. 
Love the char siew fries the most! Reasonably priced for the quality of food. Recommended to make reservation as they are mostly packed. üëçüèª
.\n<br />The thought of using \'lup cheong\' in mac &amp; cheese definitely sounds bizzare. But surprisingly, Chinese sausage actually complements creamy cheese well with its sweet-savoury fragrance.\n<br />.\n<br />I think I should start experimenting using \'bak kwa\' to cook pasta then.
Been a long time since I last had it.
Redpan is a restaurant concept that you have to check out if you haven\'t. Executing innovative concepts while embracing local flavours, expect to find interesting dishes like Char Siew Chilli Fries üçü ($7) and Hae Bi Hiam Pasta üçù ($16) on the menu.
How about some Truffle Floss Fries üçüon a (Fries)day?? ‚Ä¢ Woohooo! Sit tight, it\'s FRIDAY already!!!! ‚Ä¢\n<br />-\n<br />-\n<br />üö© Red Pan\n<br />6 Raffles Boulevard\n<br />Unit 02-03/04\n<br />Marina Square\n<br />Singapore 039594\n<br />Tel: 6255 5850\n<br />www.redpan.sg
Prawn &amp; haebihiam pasta ($16++)\n<br />Charsiew chilli fries ($7++)\n<br />Was attracted to the food fusion btw western &amp; chinese. Overrated. Fries as hard as rock (over fried). The so called \"charsiew\" doesn\'t even taste well.\n<br />Pasta is too salty with hae bi hiam tt isn\'t fragrant at all. Sooo disappointed. :(\n<br />3
Despite both being mid-embrace, the piping hot goreng pisang-esque balls maintained a frosty emotional disconnect from the Milo crumbs, with the latter gazing longingly across the room at the delectably roasty hazelnuts as Steps\' \"It\'s The Way You Make Me Feel\" plays in the background. 3.5/5
The hae bi hiam aroma at play is irresistible, whilst elsewhere the introverted sakura ebi is overshadowed by the busyness of the proceedings and is best savoured directly on its own. 3.7/5
Every inch of moist flesh, chewy cartilagey bits and sinfully charred skin went shiveringly well with the spicy chinchalok sauce, so stingingly tangy and naughty that it would make you go \"phaaaaaaatumba\" or similar incoherent sound. 4.1/5
I love the decor of this place more than the food. However this floss truffle fries is a winner! 
The name was an instant hit with me, a local touch on a pasta dish. \n<br />First taste was the anticipated spicy dried shrimp flavour on the tagliatelle. However, the novelty soon wore off and it fell flat being one-dimensional on the slightly too thick tagliatelle that was a tad dry too. Somewhat it felt like lacking an additional element or so to elevate the dish. Perhaps some pine nuts or dried seaweed?\n<br />Unfortunately, the taste couldn\'t outlast my anticipation of this hype. #burpple
Redpan\'s Steak with Chinchalok. \n<br />A hearty plate of steak, potatoes and salad, topped off with tangy Chinchalok was a refreshing twist. Oh and that sauce all over was AMAZING. Was mopping it all up with the smashed potatoes. Sadly the main star itself, the beef, wasn\'t exactly tender, but still decent. \n<br />Looking forward to trying their hainanese pork chops though! \n<br />#whyidonthaveabs #Redpan #bodyplump #igfood #foodporn
Went to check out Redpan that\'s been popping up quite a bit recently. Cool items on their menu, they serve Singaporean inspired western dishes with a few winners on that list! \n<br />The fried chicken in their house sauce had us mopping up the board with whatever we could find. A sweet, tangy kicap manis sauce with that spice mix was that goooooood. \n<br />Behind was the Char Siew Chilli Fries. Crisp fries and a savory, meaty sweet accompaniment topped off with a dollop of sour cream. \n<br />Will probably be back to try a couple of other things we couldn\'t fit in our tummies another time! \n<br />#fatdieme #foodporn #igfood #bodyplump #Redpan #whyidonthaveabs
You can‚Äôt stop eating this. Truly a type of fries I won‚Äôt mind having again and again. I imagined drier form of char siew when I saw this on the menu.
The brainchild of DP Architects and Grub, redpan serves Western grub with a local twist, making this the perfect place for a family meal after a day\'s worth of shopping. Located in Marina Square, come with the whole jin gang and start with the Truffle Floss Fries ($8). Order the Prawn and \'Hae Bi Hiam\' Pasta ($15) for Dad ‚Äî tagliatelle tossed with sakura ebi, sauteed prawns and the housemade hae bi hiam that packs a spicy punch while mum can opt for the Vegetable Lasagna ($13) that comes with grilled eggplant, mushrooms and pumpkin. End the meal on a sweet note with the Coconut Panna Cotta ($7) or the Gooey Banana Donuts \"Milo Dinosaur\" ($7).
Char Siew Chilli Fries - Thick cut fries with housemade char siew ragout, sour cream and jalape√±o salsa. \n<br />Generous portion at $7. The char siew ragout is more like minced pork with char siew sauce. The fries were addictive thou\'. Crisp on the outside, soft &amp; fluffy inside. I like how they remain crispy even when cooled.
That\'s according to @stormscape , and we put it to the test. \n<br />Did the roll pass it? #RollingInTheDeep?
A pretty light dessert to end the meal with; Coconut Panna Cotta with Gula Melaka, Grilled Pineapple Compote with nuts and lemongrass. Panna Cotta was refreshing and light in flavour; pretty light that you don\'t get much coconut flavours unless you take bigger spoonfuls into it, but goes pretty well with the sweetness of the Gula Melaka and lemongrass which gives it a whiff of herby flavour. Grilled pineapple compote seems to involve a little bit of caramel; sweet, tangy and smoky which gives the other components a contrasting flavour, while the nuts gives a little crunch to the dessert overall. Not really bothersome, but it could make things a little better if it had a lighter consistency.
An interesting take on local food with western ones. This dried shrimp chilli paste pasta is interestingly delicious and quite spicy. Yummy yummy yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2016 March 13
Looks simple, but this literally puts your back to the times when \"western\" fare was an occasional treat in a Kopitiam near your house. You get grilled, boneless chicken that is all tender, succulent with a smoky flavour with a little crispness on the skin all doused with a familiar mushroom sauce, that is rather clear and clean on the palate; pretty unlike the ones these days that comes with too much starch and all gloopy and such. Fries were crisp and well-seasoned to flavour, with a salad on the side dressed with a dressing that carried a hint of Berry flavour.
Been going around looking for old-style Hainanese Pork Cutlets and glad to have found one here which comes with the iconic tomato-based sauce that makes it Hainanese. This is probably most value-for-money dish out of the three for you get two slabs of boneless pork that is fried to golden brown perfection; all crisp with the juices all locked within that slab of tender and easy-to-chew meat. Dip each slice of pork into the tomato-based dip to get that nostalgic, slightly sweet yet tangy flavour; missing of the freeze-packed corn, peas and carrots but still quite reminiscent in flavour. Of course, the fries are crisp and well-seasoned while the dressing for the salad on the side carries a hint of Berry flavour, just like the ones served with the Temasek Chicken Chop.
This was pretty decent for its attempt on a pasta with locally-inspired elements. The linguine was done pretty al-dente, and while on first sight may look a little plain, the pasta carried a strong punch of spiciness (pretty moderate for me) with a umami flavour in their housemade spicy shrimp paste, and the Sakura Ebi just gives it a little more crunch to replicate that \"Hae bee\" touch!
This Vegetable Lasagne at newly opened casual cafe/restaurant RedPan (Marina Square) surprised us with the umami flavors! I chose it because there\'s my favorite pumpkin, eggplant, and mushroom in it. Trust me you wouldn\'t miss the meat at all, especially if it were the dry Hainanese Pork Cutlet.
The restaurant‚Äôs Sticky Date Pudding uses local red dates in its cake base as it offers less cloying sweetness and more pronounced date flavour. 
With a strong spotlight on local ingredients and familiar flavours, expect dishes such as Lup Cheong Mac &amp; Cheese, Char Siew Chilli Fries, Prawn &amp; Hae Bee Hiam Pasta, Hainanese Pork Cutlet, Steak &amp; Chinchalok, Sticky Date Pudding and more. \n<br />We are rewarding 3 readers from MissTamChiak.com with $50 dining credits each (no minimum spending).

This was no exception. As exotic as it might sound, this combination really worked for me. Mashed potatoes paired with the other laksa quentessentials such as bean sprouts and fried beancurd. There\'s nothing else I could ask for, maybe just a little more laksa gravy! Just a tip - weekday lunch sets are available, top up $3 for a soup and drink! Really worth it.\n<br />.\n<br />#makandaydream \n<br />#redpan\n<br />#marinasquare\n<br />#MSQeats\n<br />#asian\n<br />#fusion\n<br />#lunch\n<br />#laksa\n<br />#salmon\n<br />#burpple\n<br />#burpplesg\n<br />#sgfood\n<br />#sgfoodies\n<br />#sgfoodporn\n<br />#sgeats\n<br />#foodporn\n<br />#hungrygowhere\n<br />#8dayseat\n<br />#stfoodtrending\n<br />#foodinsing

Tried the fusion cuisines at marina square. The dishes at redpan are really interesting. Choices like charsiew chilli fries, hae bi hiam pasta and Bak chor foie gras pasta really tests the creativity of the chef. I was impressed because the flavours were incorporated well unlike other types of fusion food I wasn\'t too impress with. Definitely worth a try when you are bored of ordinary food!

the fries were still as crispy and the toppings still extremely generous, and I did kinda lick clean the bowl cos (just so everyone should know) no strand of floss should ever go to waste!
I ordered the Lup Cheong Mac n\' Cheese at Redpan for I had glorious memories of all that melted cheese (I bet I even dreamt of it at some point) I scraped and cleaned out every bit of cheese left on that baking dish. as the whole table commented how cheesy this dish was, I was on cloud nine inside (or maybe you can call it the cheesy heaven) üòãüòãüòã @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #jiaklocal #redpansg #redpan #macandcheese #burpplecafemonth #chopesg

Chicken Cheese Arabiki Sausages ($8)\n<br />Smoky chicken cheese arabiki sausages with sambal mayo\n<br />Beware of the burst of cheese when you bite. \n<br />|\n<br />\'Lup Cheong\' Macaroni &amp; Cheese ($12)\n<br />Chinese sausage, curry leaves and cheesy bechamel tossed with macaroni\n<br />Best share, coz jelat after a few mouthfuls. Quite oily at the bottom.\n<br />|\n<br />Prawn &amp; \'Hae Bi Hiam\' Pasta ($15)\n<br />Tagliatelle tossed with Housemade spicy shrimp paste, Sakura ebi and saut√©ed prawns.\n<br />Great flavour but a bit too dry.\n<br />|\n<br />Available at @RedPanSG in @MarinaSquareSG by the people behind @GrubSingapore \n<br />The place was relatively empty, yet they could not take in customers as most tables were for reservations. About a quarter of menu unavailable as the menu was undergoing a change.

Topped with Char Siew chilli and Jalape√±o sauce, it was a good starter; except I didn\'t quite get where really was the Char Siew taste. #burpple
Who the hell would even think steak and chinchalok would go steady with one another?!?!? Well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Medium rare. Just the way I like it!! #redpan #marinasquare  #modsin #steak #chinchalok #food #foodstagram #igfood #foodgasm #instafood #sgig #instasg #burpple #openrice #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #stfoodtrending
Quite a bit of recent online hype over the food here so decided to check it out.\n<br />Indeed their fusion mixes sounded promising, but I felt taste-wise there wasn\'t any wow factor. The chinchalok did give this steak an Asian touch, much like a Thai dish actually, so it was something different. However, there wasn\'t anything to shout about the steak, no charred fragrance nor fatty juiciness. I wished it had less veins but more marbled fats instead.\n<br />Similarly for other of its dishes, high for novelty fusion but not the same for overall taste. Had to compliment the good service here though. #burpple #sgfood #foodporn #sgfoodies #singaporefood #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #nomnonsg #steak #beef

the skin was crispy, the meat extremely tender, and again, the homemade sauce gives the pork chop a boost  in flavour. this is so good, even a four-year old kid loves it! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #brunch #chopesg #redpansg #redpan #porkchop #hainaneseporkchop @redpansg
what I love about the people behind @grubsingapore @fixsg @fixgrillsg and @celebrationssg is that they don\'t believe in short-cuts, for example, no opening of starchy canned gravy sauce to accompany this beautiful piece of meat. everything tastes homemade and wholesome, only food you will serve to your own family and loved ones! and believe it or not, for its enormous portion, this Temasek Chicken Chop only costs SGD11 üò±
I WANNA HAVE THIS NOW (can you guys hear it calling out to you yet??) @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #brunch #chopesg #redpansg #redpan #macandcheese #macncheese
don\'t say I didn\'t warn you!) and it comes with a light and tangy mango sauce on the side. I love the fact that these tasted REAL, unlike some restos\' overly-battered pieces. there\'s just the right amount of fats for you to munch on (really crispy and doesn\'t even feel oily), trust me, you can\'t stop once you start on these \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #brunch #chopesg #redpansg #redpan #latergram #pork #porkbelly @redpansg
seriously, where can you possibly find such combination of fries in Singapore other than at @redpansg? for fans of fries, let me tell you the best news - EVERY SINGLE FRY in there remained crispy all the way (a loooong way too cos we over ordered and took some time to finish everything). so addictive that I actually finished them all. A-L-L üòã a big thank you to the very friendly staff who acceded to our request for a little more floss üôäüòÅ (service at Redpan definitely gets üíØ) @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg  @sgcafefood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  #brunch #breakfast #chopesg #truffle #fries #latergram #redpansg #redpan
Review of their highly affordable, clever menu with #Singaporean flavours now on Six-and-Seven.com (active link in bio).\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#readaboutitontheblog - http://bit.ly/redpansg
It comes with grilled pineapple compote that was more intense to lift the light flavour of the coconut infused in the dessert.
These are recommended to be dipped into the housemade gravy, which gives it a sweet and tangy taste, that also serves as a dip to the fries!
It goes along well with the mushroom gravy that also act as a nice dip for the fries.
It comes with prawns and sakura ebi that completes it as a full-prawn meal.
East meets west! Lap cheong gave it the saltyness which was a nice oriental touch ..while i felt the mac &amp; cheese was just mac &amp; cheese. Hits n misses but worth going back for other dishes. #macandchesse #chinesesausage #lunch #newrestaurant #burpple #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #openricesg #stfoodtrending #igers #igfood #sgfoodies #bloggersg #singaporeinsiders #tripadvisor #chopesg
