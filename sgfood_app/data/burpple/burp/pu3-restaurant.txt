üòÇ The ayam üêì lemak chilli padi and the crispy and fragrant begedil were the most awesome of that lot! Trust me, you WILL want to slather all that rice with loads of the curry and you WILL finish that mound of rice! üòã I dare say this stall\'s begedil is the best I ever had. Still warm when served this ball of mashed potato is everything done the right way! Honourable mention goes to the beef üêÇ rendang. The beef was flavourful and nicely marinated without falling into the trap of being too dry üôåüèº. Do note that you should head over before 8pm as the food sells out pretty early. Bigger combo plate options available for larger groups!

The one pax portion served at Pu3 comes with choice of chicken or beef, cuttlefish, tempeh, chilli eggplant, bagada land ikan billis. And trust me, that\'s just about sufficient for two (even though it\'s meant to be a one pax portion). You\'ll find yourself digging into a medley of spices- having mouthfuls after mouthfuls while slurping on your Teh Cino ice to extinguish the fire in your mouth. Definitely among the more value-for-money Javanese food I\'ve had. \n<br />Pu3 is located at Somerset Bencoolen, near Sunshine Plaza. \n<br />#burpple #whati8today #setheats #8dayseat #burppletastemaker #sghawkerfood #sgfoodies sgig #tablesituation
.\n<br />Serving the traditional Nasi Ambeng, a popular Javanese cuisine, which got its communal roots as friends and family gather around the table to feast on a humongous serving platter. Your eyes are definitely not fooling you at the amount and variety of ingredients that go into this plate. For a 1 pax meal ($7.50), you will get a mountain of rice with several dishes such as curry ayam (chicken), sambal goreng (fried tofu and tempeh), terung (brinjal), paru (beef lungs), begerdil (potato patty), sambal kacang ikan bilis (sambal anchovy and peanuts), seruding (coconut floss), urap (vegetable salad) and sambal belacan. If you order for 2 pax ($29.90) and 4 pax ($50.80), there will be additional udang (sambal prawns) and ikan kering (fried dried fish).\n<br />.\n<br />My recommendation is to go on an empty stomach and with people who can handle their chilli. The meal is very hearty and definitely one of the more unique and affordable nasi padang meals that I have eaten.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 51 Bencoolen Street, Unit 01-06, Singapore 189630\n<br />============================\n<br />Now playing: üé∂ Lady Antebellum - Golden üé∂\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #eat #foodporn #foodphoto #makan #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood  #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #sginstagram #foodgasm #foodpic\n<br />============================
