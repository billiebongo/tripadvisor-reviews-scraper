Some foods can be found everywhere, such as chicken rice, roasted meat, others can only be found at one place, such as this rickshaw noodles that was touted to be very authentic. I have never tried any other rickshaw noodles but I really like the one here. You get to pick you own ingredients (think economy bee hoon style) and your own carbs. Choose from Fried bee hoon, fried mee, mee Sua and yellow noodles. All of which goes super well with their crispy side dishes. All these for only $3, what a great deal!
The fried fish dumplings were huge, crunchy and flavourful. The hor fun gravy had a slight hint of herbal taste to it, and I liked the goji berries in the gravy. Would definitely recommend this if you are in need of some comfort food.
Delicious authentic Hainanese-style Western food.. What i like about them is that they cook everything from scratch when u order... Not like some others who usually half cook the meat n reheat when u order...
Showered, or more like bathing in snow white shredded coconut, Xing Xing\'s [中国街興興] kueh kosui are simply delightful. The texture was sublime as each piece was soft yet chewy without being sticky. They were also pleasantly sweet with a great caramelly fragrance, you just can\'t stop at one!
Special Shanghai Dim Sum is the shop name. Soft and filled with meat. The skin is smooth and and melts in your mouth. Woots! Come support them! 8 pieces for $4! Worth it!
Indulgence during lunch was this super saucey Rojak ($3). With ingredients drowned in the super thick Hei Gor (prawn paste), every piece was as guilty as it is satisfying. Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim and I both left with full and satisfied tummies. 
Indulgent, with all the right reasons. Think - crispy thin pork chop, mushy stewed cabbage, blanched eggplant together with a huge scoop of Lemak curry. MORE PLEASE!!!!
One of the purest, softest, fluffiest tapioca cakes I\'ve had. This is a store I must visit whenever I head over to Maxwell. They\'re usually sold out by 12pm, hence I was pleasantly surprised when I saw them dish out the last few boxes when I went over at almost 1pm. A small pack of 4 pieces comes at the wallet-friendly price of $2. 
Half a chicken + 2 plates of rice at $11. The chicken was really soft and tender, dipped in the sauce/gravy that wasn\'t too oily. The must-eat chicken rice after you\'ve been away from SG for a longtime :p
(Stall: Hock Soon Roasted Duck Rice) If the glistened exterior of the roasted protein here did not appeal to you; the taste and value should. The consistent delivery from visuals to taste will guarantee a memorable meaty affair. 
Literally food coma-ed and just woke up from a nap while the bub is still having hers. Loving this long weekend so so much  when I can finally \"sleep in\" (when you\'re a parent that means waking up at 830 instead of 7am) and hooray to not having to rush around to Sunday classes!
😋😋😋 Beef noodle !!!! Missing this for so so so so so darn long Liao. •\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />Productive day with the Accounting Juniors today w/ tastings and mugging all in one day.
Finally got down to trying the sinful oyster cake ($2) which made me feel guilty all over. Oyster mixed with mixed meat and chives, then deep fried in a pocket. The resultant \'snack\' was an umami, meaty, juicy cake (cough, oil, cough). That said, it\'s so flavourful, half of it made me satisfied, yet the whole piece just made me feel guilty. Take my advice, share it. 
Here\'s the deal: while there are enough superior dim sum joints around, stall 46 at Maxwell is a reliable Saturday tea-time purveyor of glutinous rice topped with tender chicken bits - the basic Lo Mai Kai that needs neither tampering with, nor excuses.
One of my most favorite curry rice in Singapore! Been eating it since childhood
At a store called \'Popiah. Rojak. Cockles\' (talk about branding hahah!). I don\'t need my pohpiah fancy - no prawns/ lobster meat/ crayfish is totally fine by me. But I appreciate one made with super fresh turnips (I judge it by the crunch) and a perfectly balanced sauce ratio. I think this one from Maxwell totally cuts it. The sweet sauce is neutralized by the savory turnips and enhanced with their kickass spicy chilli, resulting in a mini party in my mouth. At a pocket-friendly price of $1.30/roll, I\'d totally recommend to buy more for sharing. 
👉 Tian Cheng Food 🏡 Maxwell Food Court, 1 Kadayanallur street, Singapore\n<br />🕰 08.00 - 22.00\n<br />💰 Yam cake $ 2.5 \n<br />🗓 21112015

Rating: 8/10. Minus 2 for the bit tasteless chicken. But I guess the sauces and rice got enough fragrant to make it yummy! Yep, worth the try. But nay, not worth the long queue. 
Enjoying our hawker food now and will be having xuan\'s better than cafe standard strawberry cake for dessert later. Absolutely love the hainan curry rice here and my order is always standard.. 😝 #burpple
Well known chicken rice from Tian Tain chicken rice store ..With blue signboard.
Red: what\'s local food without some chilli, but don\'t worry the sambal is not as potent as it looks!\n<br />Yellow: the yellow rice has a very mild garlic fragrance, not too different from regular white rice. The chicken thigh portion is huge! Well-grilled with crisp skin edges.\n<br />Green: added the sambal goreng as an essential fibre source to balance the meal? Or rather just me being greedy 😁\n<br />At $5/5.50, the chicken thigh size alone is enough to stop you in your tracks. This stall in Maxwell Market is also quite popular for its ayam penyet if you want something with more crunch.
Happiness can come in the form of scoring a bowl of fish soup from Maxwell without having to queue! 
More of a lunch affair but it\'s here cooler in the evening. Managed to get here before they sell out by 6.30-7pm... stewed cabbage is soft as it should be, pork chop is nicely marinated and savoury, soya + mild curry gravy elevate the plain rice to a higher level. Thumbs up! Better to go early to avoid running out of dishes towards the evening.
All Singaporean\'s comfort food 😌 Anyway #throwback to the our #Hawkerpedia food trail w fellow Burpple tastemakers. 🍴
However their Q was just too long, then I saw this stall with a motor mounted on their pot. So we decided to give it a try. We loved to put half of the sliced fish into the piping hot porridge and another with lime juice. \n<br />In the past, we topped the fried shallot and spring onion on our own but now they were controlled by the staffs. Even so, I was still a big fan of this place. \n<br />However, during my last visit, they had stopped selling sliced fish because of the food poisoning cases! So I went to visit other stalls like Rui Ji at Alexander Food Market and Joe Park at Chinatown Complex, they had stopped too. Here goes my days of dipping the sliced fish into the piping hot porridge and eating them half cooked. \n<br />So I had no choice but to replace them with Bee Hoon. 😭😭😭. Return the SLICED FISH to me!!! #Hawkerpedia
[Fried Tofu S$3.50] - from 和记包. Thanks to @rainraineeataway \'s recommendation! #hawkerpedia
4 munchies: I\'d still gladly order everything on the table again – Hoe Kee Porridge\'s Fried Tofu, Tian Tian Chicken Rice, and Marina South\'s Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee. Thank you, Raine, Julius, Jacq and Vivienne, for sharing your picks!
Had my fill of really delicious chicken wings, satay, porridge, toufu and gyoza last night. Really one of the best food centers in Singapore! 
I had one of the most delicious chicken wings here. It was sooooo good. I think I could eat like 5 of it and want more! Minimum order of 3 btw. They also sell Satays too and it\'s quite yummy too! :)
I stopped having Papaya Milk in Singapore after a trip to Taiwan because the ones here just can\'t compare! What makes a good Papaya milk is definitely the balance between the milkiness, sweetness and fragrance of the Papaya. This one from Juice Farm at Maxwell Food Centre just hits all the right notes! Sweet, fragrant and not overly milky. In fact, my friend (who tends to avoid taking papaya milk because of its overpowering milkiness) had given his two thumbs up for this cup. 
I do have some awesome colleagues! Look at what I have here, light crispy batter encasing a piece of sweet caramelized banana!!!! The banana fritters from Lim Kee Maxwell Food Centre are really good 🍌! The fritters are not too soft but it does melt in your mouth~ I can eat 10!
The Guo Tie (Fried Dumplings) here is my go-to comfort dish, together with the Spicy Sour Soup! At a reasonable price of $4 for 8dumplings #BurppleCheapNGood
Permanent long queue at this curry rice stall! But worth the wait! 
Just one look and you\'ll be in love with it. Definitely one of the best pancakes around you can find it in a number of food centres across town. The peanut and sugar mixture is not too sweet plus the pancake itself is not thick. At 80 cents per piece I\'m eating it whenever and wherever I can find it. 
Cannot believe I actually need a \"guide\" to lead me to maxwell from my office. Plus I think I managed to impress Mr Tay  by squeezing time to visit #SPRMKRT during my one hour lunch break after our lunch! /\n<br />The ZJM was not nice at all BTW. And no pics for the loots I got from SPRMRKT as they don\'t look instaworthy and the Coffee Tonic is totally not to my liking. #burpple
In love with the texture &amp; the fragrant of the rice! The chicken isn\'t the best I had, it taste a little bland... But the rice is definitely worth the calories 😍 
Definitely not one of my usual orders here. Okay lah, I wanted to say that this is mindblowing and super good. It\'s just... Not bad Lah, worth the money hahaha!
Decent pancakes that tend towards the sweeter side!! 
天天鸡饭 - the dish that outshone Gordon Ramsay! It\'s really worth the hype and queue, though we were lucky we didn\'t have to queue for it then (last Sunday night). Oh, and the Shanghainese 水饺 is a must try too!
Not the best of days, so I decided to treat myself to this bowl of clear fish soup at Maxwell. Expect a sweet fish broth, with chunky fresh fish slices, lots and lots of vegetables, tofu and tomatoes. Wholesome and comforting in every possible way. 
It\'s amazing to see how the food trend evolved from time to time, but local food fare doesn\'t. One of the most affordable and good thai food that you can find in Maxwell Food - Sisaket Thai Food.
My favorite (no long Q) congee stall! 😍😍😍
At the cost $1.50, you get double of what a usual curry puff size is. Having to say their curry puff isn\'t that outstanding but it\'s a stop by to have when you\'re at Maxwell Food Centre.
Love the spice of the curry and the crisp of the cutlets? Well, don\'t resist yourself to try one of the best Hainanese Curry Rice @ Maxwell Market.
Now operated by the daughter, I have been chomping down their \"hum jin peng\" (they sell this and only this) since the father\'s time. Believe it or not, one piece used to cost only 10 cents back then but prices have risen slightly to 6 for $1 (or 3 for 70 cents). They offer two types - salty and sweet. I personally find it hard to discern them by sight but I think the sweet one has got more sesame seeds and subtle dark patches on it (this is due to the red bean paste inside). \n<br />What gives this stall an extra special touch is the long wooden chopsticks provided for customers to help with the frying. The lady owner is usually busy cutting and rolling out the dough before dropping them into the deep pan of hot oil. So it falls on the customer, especially during peak periods, to give a hand with the frying of their own order, flipping the \"hum jin peng\" over as they puff up to get a nice even golden-brown colour. This clever teamwork helps the queue to move along faster as well. A win-win situation.
went there to get tian tian but the stall was closed so tried this instead. paid 19 for 3. quality wise was kinda disappointing. 😟
When talking about porridge in Maxwell Food Centre, Zhen Zhen usually comes to mind. However, when it comes to good Cantonese porridge, Hoe Kee is a strong contender. Their raw sliced fish/ pork &amp; century egg porridges - hot, smooth, and comforting, are huge hits, and with their generous portions and opening hours stretching until 2.30am (4am on Fri-Sun), we can definitely see why!
Little street food stand in the middle of Chinatown food street patrons, for a delicious coconut laksa. #peranakan #laksa #soup
Well known for their chicken rice after the Gordon Ramsey challenge, this stall never fails to front a queue! The chicken is very well complemented by its rice. Truly a good hawker fare!
$7.50. Char side thin &amp; tender, egg not too bad, can be more flavored, soup rather salty, came back feeling thirsty.
Lemak gravy, very soft potatoes. Good stuff. Relatively new stall facing the road.
Feels like I went back to grandma\'s place for dinner!
Smooth Silky Porridge, my kind of food. \n<br />Side tip: They allowed you to top up the spring onions and fried shallots on your own. Sweet Fried Shallots!!! So Good!!! Hoe Kee Porridge\n<br />Maxwell Food Centre, 1 Kadayanallur St #01-45/46 s069184  Friday to Sunday 6.30am to 4pm\n<br /> Monday to Thursday 6.30am to 2.30 pm
Mixed it with thin sliced chili and sprinkler a layer of sesame. The acidic lime juice slowly cooked the raw fish and gave its the bouncy texture. Together with the aromatic roasted sesame and spicy chili made it so refreshing. \n<br />Hoe Kee Porridge\n<br />Maxwell Food Centre, 1 Kadayanallur St #01-45/46 s069184  Friday to Sunday 6.30am to 4am\n<br /> Monday to Thursday 6.30am to 2.30 am
A less popular stall but tasted much better than the famous one. \n<br />I love to dip the raw fish into the piping hot porridge. Let the fish slowly turned from translucent to pale white. Happy Days!!! Hoe Kee Porridge\n<br />Maxwell Food Centre, 1 Kadayanallur St #01-45/46 s069184 \n<br />6.30am to 4am Friday to Sunday \n<br />6.30am to 2.30 am Monday to Thursday
Another stall at Maxwell that has gained a following is Jin Hua, serving bowl after bowl of steaming hot fish bee hoon. Whichever way you like your fish soup - milky or non-milky broth, sliced fish or fried fish - you\'ll be satisfied here. You can get fish head bee hoon here as well, if that\'s your thing. Tasty broth, a good serving of sliced or fried fish, noodles, complete with the addition of tofu, seaweed, vegetables, and tomatoes for slight sweetness make for a good, hearty meal. 
You HAVE to go early to get your hands on their ondeh ondeh if you want to try it, because it sells out really quickly. And early means by lunch time at around 1230, which is a major bummer for those of us who are not early birds. Bite into the coconut-coated super soft ondeh ondeh and you get a burst of liquid gula melaka, which might tastes like liquid gold. They\'re handmade and addictive; it\'ll be surprising if you can stop at one. Their tapioca cake and muah chee (which is slightly different as they\'re filled with peanuts instead of coated) are superb as well.
Tian Tian needs no introduction. Serving arguably the best chicken rice in Singapore, you\'ll never not see a queue at this stall. From the rice to the chilli, everything is worth raving about. The chicken, delightfully tender and juicy, sits atop a bed of perfectly cooked, fragrant rice. Have it with the ginger and chilli, with the latter getting its brightness from calimansi juice and not vinegar. Tian Tian truly captures what hawker food should be: cheap and so, darn, good. Even Gordon Ramsay can\'t beat it.
You can choose from a selection of 5 vegetables, 1 meat/seafood and a dressing. I picked romaine lettuce, garlic prawns, corn kernels, sundried tomatoes, French beans, fuscilli, orange vinaigrette
Fuzhou Oyster Cake (福州蠔餅). I love this! Used to buy from the stall at Bugis Village when they were still selling 1 for S$1.50. (The last I ate, it\'s S$2.50). When I saw it yesterday at Maxwell, I knew I have to get it! Maxwell\'s version is S$2 for 1 but it\'s worth every penny and calorie! Oyster, prawns, minced pork &amp; chives encased in a thin batter that is crispy on the outside, moist and soft bursting with flavours inside. A must try @ Maxwell Food Centre! I prefer this to the one at Bugis Village! (Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake/洪家福州蠔餅, Maxwell Food Centre, Stall 5, #01-05, close on Sundays). 
I like their fried carrot cake, white or black. The fried kway teow is nice too!
Food from maxwell! Best porridge ever! With @ravericko for sun run
Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake. Always appetizing.
Worth the more-than-half-an-hour-queue :) | ★★★★☆
Always love to eat the fish soup here. Soup is nice and the fish is super fresh with @raverickwee
This is da bomb! I don\'t know what to call it, but imagine pillowy soft mochi skin filled with fragrant peanuts. 
Maxwell Market has a few new promising stalls. One of them is Huang Ji, which sells tomato wanton noodles which piles with lots of greens.
Hainanese chicken rice, soya milk and you tiao. That sums up my breakfast for Monday.
Presentation.... Not really impressive, but the texture of the porridge is smooth as silk! And it\'s damn worth it!! But prepare for the need to queue.
Hum chim peng: chinese donuts with red bean paste. 6 small pieces for $1, freshly made on the spot!
Chickens at Tian Tian sold out! 😞  Damn long queue for this Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken rice. This better be good... 
A plate of Charsiew Wanton Mee from the Old Tiong Bahru Roast Specialist! 
Review of the newly hawker stall Yi Ji Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee (Maxwell Market stall 01-39).  There was around 6 pax queuing, but I manage to get my plate of hokkien prawn mee in less than 10 mins. Serving size comes in a price of $4 and $6. This one was fried until all the prawn stock has been completely absorbed into the noodles and beehoon! It wasn\'t dry and not too moist, every mouthful was quite delightful! The chili was exceptionally good, and spicy! 
Another \"new kid on the block\" open at Maxwell Market about one week old!  Yi Ji Fried Hokkein Prawn Mee!
Deliciously good chicken chop and pork chop as recommended by \'Our makan places\'! Western craving checked! #western #dinner #fotd
Battle of the Maxwell chicken rice! Left - Ah Tai, right - Tian Tian. Which do you prefer?
So many new stalls at Maxwell. This ketchup noodles stall is actually quite promising.
Finally, after craving ages for red ruby! S$2.50 (stall 71)
Another Hawker fare for lunch! 满满一桌! Sounds familiar! 😂
Corner cafe in maxwell food center. And they have kopi luwak. Wheeee

Fish meat bee hoon. My favourite! Anyone else had this before?

Hidden gem porridge &amp; dim sum @ He Ji Porridge 🍲\n<br />*****\n<br />It\'s easy to overlook this place as so many famous stalls in Maxwell Food Center &amp; the stall is tucked to the quiet corner of the food center.🤔\n<br />.\n<br />However, we are a porridge convert after trying their classic sliced pork porridge $3.50. They serve generous ingredients in the bowl &amp; porridge is neither too runny nor dense.👌 Nice texture, tasty &amp; wallet friendly. We also try their egg tart which is a decent one albeit not much to talk about.

Those who are familiar with Ipoh would have heard of the silky smooth douhua from Funny Mountain. Woong Kee is just as good, if not better. I prefer mine with white sugar. That is how it is usually served in Ipoh. The sweetness is very subtle which is perfect when combined with the silky smooth douhua.\n<br />*\n<br />The owner of the stall in Singapore is a relative of Woong Kee and the quality is therefore similar. It is authentic, ideal for those who are missing Ipoh tau foo fah. Even if you are not from Ipoh, you would still appreciate the taste and texture of Woong Kee’s douhua.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_woongkee #woongkee #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Spinach soup that is so clear and light. Minced pork, peawns and shiitake mushrooms are the suppporting ingredients. Loads of spinach filled three quarters of my bowl. Felt as if I downed almost a whole packet of this green leafy goodness.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Did you know spinach is packed with lotsa vitamins and minerals? Helps to reduce cholesterol too. As a foodie, it is always imperative to jiak healthy and detoxify. Because too much of a bad thing is not good in the long term.
Dont forget to add on the crispy homemade tofu. 😋
Greasy, oily and perfect, just the way it should be 👍🏼
You can try your hand at frying your own hum jin pang here, which is really cool. Of course, if you burn it, it\'s your fault 😅
Colourful, messy and tasty.\n<br />#maxwellhawker #canonsg #singaporefoodfestival #burpple
Too much sugar used but otherwise a very tasty rojak with balanced proportion of ingredients at only $3: fried fritter, Tau Pok (dried bean curd), pineapple slices, cucumber slices, radish slices, apple slices, bean sprouts, prawn paste and generous ground peanut. My kind of \"dessert\".
The roast pork and roast duck are highly recommended: Each piece was thick, juicy and full of flavors, with a nice crackling skin for the pork and a thin crispy one for the duck. The char siew was pretty ordinary -- although if you\'re lucky, they might just give you a few pieces of char siew like they did today.
Thick slices of fish without the fishyness. Garnished with lotsa shredded ginger, a little taucheo (salted bean) &amp; chilli padi to fire up the palate. ◾◾\n<br />Tasted pretty yummilicious. Prolly because I was the first few customers upon opening and everything was fresh. In just under afew minutes, the queue grew longer. Best timing to go is before 11.30 am.
The egg noodles were tangy, and the light savory sauce wasn\'t greasy at all. For an extra kick, chilli is highly recommended. The wantons were outstanding: The pork was supremely well-marinated and wrapped in a very thin skin. There was a spurt of saltiness in each bite of the dumpling, but it wasn\'t off-putting at all.
Granted, the chicken was succulent and tender, but the rice was a disaster. It was brown from being drowned in salty soy sauce, leaving an unsavory aftertaste after the meal. Suffice to say, a sugar cane stall profited from my plight.
I visited an old gem for the first time: [Zhen Zhen Porridge]. Simply sublime.
Traditional black soy beancurd with lotus seeds and red bean 🙆🏻 Love the smooth silky beancurd. Asked for less sugar since the red bean is sweet 😋\n<br />•\n<br />#foodphotography #foodporn #foodsg #foodie #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #burpple #hungrygowhere @burpple @hungrygowhere
It also comes with chili, crackers and slices of cucumber!

The only white are the squids. Beehoon was prepared over a big fire in a huge wok. Smells wokhei but yet not wokhei. Seems delish but yet not delish. Confusing?🤔\n<br />◽◾\n<br />Looks appealing. Not saying it is all bad. Infact tasty. But... it was laden with monosodium glutamate and sodium. Do not have the wokhei or smoky aftertone. Where did the heat go as I clearly saw the big fire when uncle was frying. This would be a promising plate of white beehoon if only the white beehoon uncle could reduce the levels of msg and salt.\n<br />◾▫\n<br />Alone but yet not alone. Me, myself and I enjoyed the quiet and peaceful lunch. A day of tranquil silence. A day of me time with my bestie, the camera.
A surprising find at Maxwell. Lala beehoon with lotsa spinach. Broth was light, flavorful and had a tinge of wokhei. Small lalas but mixed with sliced fish and prawn. It was so yummy.\n<br />🔸🔹\n<br />Did you know spinach is one of the healthiest foods? High nutritional value, rich in antioxidants, helps to improve eyesight, healthy blood pressure just to name a few. I think I can eat this like every alternate day. Every slurp was addictive and savored slowly. Every green was chewed so delicately. Enjoyed to the last bit.
For a dollar, you get a bowl of piping hot yellow noodle that comes with dried shrimps and some silver of greens and carrots, topped with fried shallots.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood \n<br />#weeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #rickshawnoodles
#tiantian chicken rice, 五香, ckt and carrot cake!
This was from a store aptly called \'Rojak, Popiah and Cockles\'. Being one of the awardees of the \'City Hawker Food Hunt\' for the best Popiah in Singapore, I had to give a shot. Sadly, this isn\'t one of the best popiah I\'ve eaten, and it probably isn\'t a popiah I would crave or return to either. The skin was quite tough to eat and chew, nothing like the handmade popiah skins that are delicate and soft. And the radishes were more wet than the usual popiah, leaving the popiah a lot more soggy than I\'d like it to be. Nevertheless, Maxwell has other food options like Zhen Zhen Porridge and Min Jiang Kueh that I\'d gladly eat any day.
But hey this is not ondeh ondeh. This is tapioca with grated coconut.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Because the coconut was coruscating its dark golden brown color, it caught my eye and it was the last piece left. One bite and many bites later, woo... I thoroughly enjoyed chomping on it. Tapioca was not soggy or soft. A chunky texture with a gentle sweetness of the coconut uplifted the tapioca.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />So elated to have grab the last piece. No regrets cos it was yummy. So bye bye to ondeh ondeh, this is my new love.
😋👌🏻 In fact the coconut one is so popular that moments after the lady sliced the roll into pieces, they got sold out. 😱
The ever popular steamed tapioca that was worth queuing for.\n<br />🔹🔸\n<br />I was lucky to get my hands on this as it was just made fresh... still steaming warm. Soft and does not stick to your teeth texture. Just so yummeh!!\n<br />🔸🔹\n<br />By noon time, it was sold out. Really cannot get enough of it. So light and no matter how full your tummy is, there is always room for steamed tapioca.
It was a pleasant surprise to bump into @i_post_for_love ... caught him enjoying and slurping his favorite fish soup.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Yes... he was like a \"pr\" person describing his fave food. So I decided to have the fish prawn beehoon soup. The soup was certainly light which I wanted. The sliced fish, I believed, had salt added to it and some was salty with some abit bland. If you want something to spice it up, there is the help yourself all  sinful and awesome crispy pork lard. What I Iiked, the prawns were butterflied and deveined which many places do not bother to. Overall, it fitted my purpose of a super light lunch. Comforting food.\n<br />🔸🔸 For $5 for this mixed soup, it is value for money and I could see why it is pops with so many. \n<br />#lunch #hawkerfood #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burpple #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instameetfoodies #instafollow #singaporeinsiders #singaporefood #discoversg

Our Hawker Spotlight event guide- local celebrity Mr Moses Lim rightly commented that it is rare to find such vibrant displays at rojak hawker stalls these day.  \n<br />Whether some of them solely served the purpose of display is besides the point- indeed kudos to the stall for its effort. \n<br />Appearance aside, you will find the most earnest plate of rojak around with rare ingredients like sliced mangoes and torch ginger flowers in the fresh darken concoction.
Got my equally yummy one in just 1 minute \n<br />#maxwell #eatlocal #bitessg #tslmakan #burpple #openricesg #hungrygowhere #chickenrice #hainan #igsg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodtrend #lunch #latergram #throwback #vscocam #foodvsco

The fish beehoon was very generous with its sliced fish. The $5 bowl had like 8-9 pcs of 🐟, its soup was milky and so good! 👍🏻\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burps #delicious #eatoutsg #exploresingapore #foodcoma #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodsdiscovery #foodsg #happytummy #hawkerfood #fishbeehoon #jiaklocal #jinhuafishsoup #latergram #nomnnomnom #openricesg #potd #instadaily #instagood #instafood #instafoodie #sgig #sgfood #tslmakan #vscosg #vscofood
You can try 75 Peanut Soup at Maxwell Hawker Centre which is a Favourite of Locals and Travellers #ieatishootipost#hungrygowhere#instafood#foodporn#Rocasia#iweeklyfood#yummy#instagram#8days_eat#theteddybearman#eatoutsg#whati8today#yummy#eatoutsg#foodforfoodie#vscofood#igfoodie#eatingout#eatstagram#sgfood#foodie#foodstagram#SingaporeInsiders#sg50#100happydays#burpple#eatbooksg#hawkerpedia #ilovehawkerfood
This is my favourite fish soup from Maxwell market. I know there are fans of fish soup from other stalls, but to me this stall serves the freshest sliced fish, in a clear soup without all the frills (no need for XO, added sugar, szechuan veg). Only by using the freshest fish can they pull this off. And look at the fish roe, bright creamy white for only an additional $1! But they run out fast due to very limited quantities per day. I can talk non stop about this fish soup but I shall stop here :) #fishsoup #sghawker #hawkersg #burpple
My Favourite salad! Sausages were nicely grilled

Nice food and cheap.
Opens from 7:30-2:30 daily except Wednesday\'s.

Come with 2 rice. The small mango salad was surprisingly nice. Glad that in tomyum soup can find a few prawns and fresh kind of sotong with legs type. Just abit concerned that their omelette inside the beansprouts like not fully cooked.  #maxwellfoodcentre #sisaketthaifood #sgfood #burpple #sghaze

At the Rickshaw Noodle 拉車麺中国街㷦食 stall 87 of Maxwell Market, it offers rickshaw noodle at $0.80 (small) &amp; $1.20(large). It also offers mee suan, fried bee hoon, fried kuay teow, and assorted deep fried fritters (priced from $0.20 to $0.80). The above meal just costs $4.20.\n<br />Great and simple meal which reminds one of home cooked food.
Bliss. #burpple

Yummy~ chili is shiok 😘😘😘
The sauce here is not as thick and gooey as the one at Scissors Cut and I personally prefer the latter. But the chicken chop here is the true winner.

Recent hawker fare meet up with the girls. Worst oyster omelette EVER. Mouthful of starch, gross oysters.. The rest were alright. I hope it just happened to be lousy that day cos the carrot cake was ok when i had it the other time. :(
Not from Tian Tian, but just as nice
A bit overhyped I think. Not worth the queue.
