The hokkien mee was tasty and Chilli was mixed with Ikan billis. The ingredients were fresh especially the prawn. Worth it!
Big cup of drink with longan &amp; pineapple at only $1 each. Very worth it!
Simple comfort food.
Finally get to eat this Crispy Noodle (生面) which sister often cook for her kids. Love the crisp texture egg noodle that soak in the seafood sauce base. #cuisineparadiseeatout #sgfood #noodles #burpple #asianfood
With the heavy downpour this morning, this bowl of pipping hot lean pork porridge definitely helped to warm me up! Add an egg for an additional $0.50, you\'ve got yourself a thick flavorful bowl of goodness that warms you inside &amp; out! 
BILL: $20.40
Came across this Pau shop at ABC Brickworks Market that does handmade Pau within their small stall named Pau Zai. Had only the Char Siew Pau for we did not have got much stomach space left — not the best handmade Pau out there but of a commendable quality; fluffy, light bun with chunky char Siew filling encased. The filling is more on the meatier side and is largely savoury with a light tinge of sweetness afterwards. It\'s rare to see stalls that painstakingly do their own Pau these days, and it\'s indeed heartening to see hawkers like Pau Zai go through the time-consuming process just to bring the taste of heritage to the masses — something that is worth supporting.
Probably the cheapest wanton mee that you can find in Singapore nowadays! This is one of my default item to go for when I come here! Unit 01-39 #CheapAndGood
🍜\n<br />If you are, I urge you to give Ma Bo Lor Mee a try.\n<br />🍜\n<br />Where most Lor Mee\'s gravy tend to be overly thick and sticky, the gravy for Ma Bo\'s version is just slightly starchy and has a nice herbal flavor, more a soup than a gravy. It reminded me of a herbal braised duck soup and was so good that I drank most of it.\n<br />🍜\n<br />Noodles also do not have the \"Kee\" (alkaline) taste which I dislike. Or if you prefer, you can also opt for Vermicelli. For my fried fish lor mee, it contained bean sprouts, delicious fried fish chunks (or Chinese style tempura) and half a tasty braised hard boiled egg.\n<br />🍜\n<br />I ordered the small size lor mee at SGD 3 Nett and got a decent portion that filled me. (I had to highlight this because there are some places where the small size is only enough to fill my 5 year old nephew). And if you are feeling extra hungry, go for the large size one at only SGD 4 Nett.\n<br />🍜\n<br />There you have it, yummy and cheap hawker fare! You may have to self serve and brave the heat a little but you will get cheap and good food you can never have elsewhere.\n<br />🍜\n<br />Ma Bo Lor Mee\n<br />6 Jalan Bukit Merah\n<br />ABC Brickworks Market and Food Centre 01-39\n<br />🍜
Soya Bean \n<br />The sugar cane juice was rich in taste despite looking rather diluted and comes in a big portion on a mug that is not commonly found nowadays.
Prawn Mee
Quarter of fabulous meats — roast duck, char siew, sio bak and the pièce de résistance, 不见天 char siew — from Fatty Cheong...YAAS! Grilled chicken chop with foot long cheese sausage from Wow Wow West...because nostalgic and fabulous. And popiah. Ok, that\'s all.
I didn\'t get the Durian Mango Ice though. #instafood #singapore #burpple
To me, the best roast duck and char siew rice at ABC market. Get it, quick.
2.5 munchies: While it was great that the rice was cooked from scratch (hence the waiting time of 20 mins or so), I prefer it in bigger grains and cooked al dente. Not only the tasteless chicken needed to be marinated longer, there was also not enough salted fish to contrast the dark soy sauce and sesame oil flavours. Oh, and I decided to forget about the missing bok choy in the dish since I ordered kai lan as a side.
Super yummy, the steamed pork meat with salted fish ($4) tastes super tasty. Watercress soup ($3.5) is so refreshing too. Bbq chicken wings ($1.2 each) was so so but still nice haha plus sugar cane drink 👍 is a must order drink. :)
This is my favorite place to look for awesome and delicious hawker food. Wide range of different hawker food can be found here. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Was treated to this by my colleague, this is the first time I\'ve tried poh piah with cravat filling😋😋😋 not bad though:&gt;
It was quite bland though, but it did managed to cure my hunger opangs☺️☺️
The portion was huge and the best thing was that I was super hungry so kudos to that☺️☺️☺️
Hylam Street Old Street: Traditional Nanyang Old Coffee $2.80 per set very nostalgia with local flavours. But I will not wait another 30 minutes for it. That\'s the reason why Toastbox is successful.
Top 10 chendol in Singapore. My rating system 😍shiok must return 😜Shiok only if you are in the neighborhood 👎don\'t bother. This chendol is 😍
Found in ABC Market, this hokkien mee was pretty sumptuous! There\'s a good balance between wetness and dryness. The bee hoon slightly harder than normal, gave a nice texture to the soft yellow and white noodles. Because it\'s a 6 dollar plate, prawns and sotong were found in large amounts. And they were reasonably fresh too. Be prepared to face a short queue, but definitely one of the places to stop by at ABC along with the adjacent Indian stall selling Briyani, Wow Wow West, Lor Mee, Fatty Cheong, and the Shanghai food stall. 
A bowl of kway and a plate of mixed pork intestines brighten my day! 
Can\'t wait for our #CoffeeAndCravings event tonight. See you if you\'re attending.
Think we will treasure them more when they come back.
Yet another recommendation by ieatishootipost, this stall is another place found for all chicken rice lovers! (Tong Fong Fatt Chicken Rice). 😊😊🐣🐣🐣\n<br />Especially loved how the chicken here is really tender and the sauce is just simply sooo good. Definitely a cut over most of the chicken rice stalls out there so far! Yumyummm 😊\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Went there to try the famous char siew hawker stall [FattyCheong] promoted by ieatishootipost. \n<br />I\'ve to say the char siew here is really thick and extremely generous with their serving for a cheap price of only ($3.50)! It is really nice but better to have it once in a while due to the amount of fats in this dish 😂.\n<br />To add on, by right the chili was supposed to enhance the flavor of the whole dish but since I can\'t take spiciness at all, I gave it a miss! 😔 #Foodphotography #Sgfood
Just opposite the famous hokkien mee to cool you down after all the queueing and flame breathing chili food. As I\'m \"allergic\" to durian. So here\'s 流氓冰 without the \"榴\" 😂 really good fresh sweet mango cubes with condensed milk along with ice shavings.
The old uncle frying this famous Tiong Baru Yi Sheng Fried Hokkien Mee is already 65 and his sons are not inheriting his skills and recipes. We can only enjoy and savour this dish at ABC Brickworks while we can. On the side note, the chili for this is spicy 😥
One of my favorite dishes from the hawker is duck rice with sour vinegar chili (the type that\'s usually served with kuay chap). This stall at ABC Market is always generous with its portions, and taste is always spot on. Having said that, it\'s really the chili that seals the deal.
This corn &amp; durian ice kachang is perfect for days when the sun is smiling brightly upon us. And how can the those sweet artificial syrups not put a smile on our faces too?! 😄 One more day till the crazy weekend starts 💪 #icekachang #dessert #abcBrickworks
Was craving for this. Was pretty good! But found the oysters a bit smelly. Not sure whether it\'s just my taste buds. 
Sausage was a tad cold but order came really fast. Coleslaw wasn\'t that fantastic actually. Saw somebody else\'s fish and chips and it was huge. Would like to try that some day. They gave 2 packs of chilli. 
Thanks to Le lovely bf for getting the matcha red bean drink with EXTRA red bean for me! Love it max! 😚😘😙
You\'ll be surprised at how good this hawker stall\'s local desserts are. Straightforward, sincere and potent. That\'s what the desserts at Jin Jin scream, in all their sweet glory. The Power Chendol is generous with beans and gula melaka, and is nicely lemak. The Gangster Mango Ice is an indulgent bowl of gorgeous durian puree over chunks of sweet mango. Definitely one for the durian lovers! Share these sweet treats please...
You won\'t regret this choice if you love Indian food, a somewhat uncommon go-to cuisine in hawker centres. First, the queue piques your curiousity, but it\'s the smell that ultimately lands you in that very queue, and soon you\'re ordering chicken briyani with fresh tandoori chicken and spiced cabbage. The rice is light, and well-coated with flavour from chicken parts cooked with it, and the tandoori unexpectedly tender. Go for their fantastic fresh naan and curries if you don\'t feel like rice!
While the char siew is arguably much better over at the famous Fatty Cheong, Sin Heng Kee is the underdog of roast meats at ABC, quietly satisfying it\'s relatively shorter queue of loyal regulars. Go for their roast chicken and duck, and add sio bak if you\'re ravenous! Served over tasty chicken rice and drenched in light sauce with a side of chili, this is a sinful plate that will silence the table. Don\'t miss it.
I\'ve queued for 20 mins (not bad) just to try how delish you are! Totally shiok!!! And so cheap ($5), yet very generous servings!!!! I couldn\'t even finish it.
There\'s just something about an extra big claypot of rice that\'s makes it so exciting. Charred flavours mixed with tender chicken joints and random bits of salted fish! Yumms.
A pity that there was no wok hei, but the prawns were quite sweet. Very picky hor? 😅😅 I want to try the charcoal-fried Hokkien Mee at Geylang!!
Still no Fatty Cheong 😭😭😭!I want my \"不见天\" Char Siew!But nvm, we had half a roasted duck and $4 roast pork. I packed half the plate of roast duck home in the end. 😂😂
Brisk business for Wow Wow West, a western food stall at ABC market. The chicken chop was not too bad though I wished the sauce would be thicker. But pretty good for a hawker standard.
A pretty famous stall but was disappointed by it. The rice just smelled and tastes burnt.
Brown sugar ice kachang &amp; power chendol all drenched in gula Melaka. 
Rice and chili done right, accompanied by good roasted duck and chicken, and at a price of $4.50, a must try!
Beautiful! 
Jin Jin Hot &amp; Cold Drinks are famed for their Gangster Ice! (mango ice topped with durian)
Tanglin serves great carrot cakes with huge portions!
Tiong Bahru Yi Sheng Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee serves one of the nicest fried Hokkien mee!
It\'s time for some hot crispy fried carrot cake!  Asian style
It\'s time for yummy #zichar!! Love #zichar you get to share and eat all varieties! ! Economical
\nI ordered the Chicken Cutlet at $6. One thing special about this stall is they served the portion based on our body size which means huge portion will be given for those big-sized person &amp; small portion given for small-sized person. Being a western food lover, I will look out for crispness &amp; freshness of the chicken cutlet. This stall serves excellent &amp; juicy chicken cutlet &amp; chicken chop. The side dishes like baked beans, coleslaw &amp; fries are given in generous portion &amp; I like the crinkle cut fries as is very crispy. As for the chicken cutlet, the chicken meat is juicy &amp; tender. Even though, I went during lunch hours and crowded but their service quite fast as I waited for around 10mins. Overall, the food &amp; service is good &amp; is a must try for all western food lovers!  ^_^
Make a guess, what am I going to today?

First time at ABC Brickworks for early lunch. Loving the North Pakistan\'s food to bits, esp the chickpea curry and green bean lentil! Right opposite, the Indonesian stall was calling out to bff... she bought this plate of lontong just for me even though I was already having naan and all the curries! Too bad the Jin Jin Dessert stall was still close when we were there..
Roasted meat &amp; duck. Just look at the roasted glazed skin and sauce. Great meal! 
Shaved Ice drenched in condensed milk , top with mango sauce and freshly cut mango. Served with additional coat of condensed milk once again. $2 
Awesome chilli sauce with roasted duck and chicken rice. $4.50 for two meat &amp; $5 for three.

I prefer the white one with some chili in it. Devoured this Ghim Moh Market carrot cake in no time.
.\n<br />The broth is clean and robust, while the tendon is soft and crunchy. The best part is their tender tripe and springy ball.\n<br />.\n<br />Definitely a must try if you are in #bukitmerah #abcbrickworks .\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #huffposttaste #nomnom #STfoodtrending \n<br />#topcitybites #vscofood #foodoftheday #fdprn #lgv30
The stall also offers pumpkin rice for 30 cents more than the plain rice, which was very tasty and complements well with the soup!

Ok, that\'s all.
不见天 is simply becoz this portion at the belly of the pig which literally does not see the sky. Which is also the armpit of the pig.\n<br />The meat is springy and tender, if you are a fan of fat char siew this is the stall for you. I love the braised sauce which is very flavourful and rich. The sambal chilli is really good too. 9.5/10 \n<br />Prepare to Q~\n<br />-\n<br />#instafood #insta_food #food #sgfood #sgfoods #foods #yummy #hungry #foodism #foodgram #foodgasm #foodfie #foodspam #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodstagram #foodspotting #sgfoodspotting #foodshare #sgfoodshare #foodpics \n<br />#sgfoodpics #foodie #foodlover #8dayseat #burpple #hawkerfood #lunch
-\n<br />The stock is simmered with pork bone, pig skin and prawn head which is well absorbed by the noodles and not forgtting the generous amount of squid. It\'s very fragrance but slightly salty for me.

打包ed a 大包 ($1.30) as a snack. Hmm it was a bit salty for me. Starting to wonder if there\'s something wrong with my taste buds.
It comes with pig innards such as liver and stomach, as well as meatballs, pork belly, lean meat and salted vegetables.

I like mine dark which means it gets fried with dark sauce. Saw a queue at Soon Lee and decided to try. The raddish was moist and the dark sauce combination with the Chilli made it really yummy. Prefer the Zion road hawker centre one but this is lovely for those unable to wake up early and taste the Toa Payoh Lorong 1 market one. #burpple #sgfoodies #sgfood #sghawkerfood #burpplesg
