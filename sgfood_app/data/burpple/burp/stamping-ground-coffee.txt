This was simple and so good! Fresh and sweet crabmeat mixed with mentaiko, sandwiched between pillowy soft toasted brioche slices 😍 ($13)
Light and refreshing drinks for a HOT afternoon - really good; no wonder they\'re so popular! We managed to get the last servings of each of these drinks and we got there before 1pm! Do go early if you want to give these a try.
My husband and I love our coffee and we live in Boston that has a terrible coffee scene. The variety of cafes in Singapore is mind blowing and Stamping Ground features highly on our list of places to go. We can\'t wait to visit Singapore (and Stamping Ground) again!
Stamping Ground Coffee has since moved from Club Street (the grounds had recently been taken over by Bicky &amp; Brew) to the east at Upper East Coast Road within the same building just few units away from Udders &amp; Kook. Apart from sandwiches and toast and a waffle and Bostock for the dessert selection, the Bacon Jam is one of those brunch dishes that gives the day a comforting start. Unlike One Man Coffee\'s Gashouse Eggs where the egg resides within the bread, the Bacon Jam at Stamping Ground Coffee comes with the sous vide egg sitting in the middle in between the Brioche and the layer of melted cheese. A satisfying option, expect smoky and sweet-savoury bits of bacon replicating a sweeter version of bakkwa that gives the dish a little bite, seated atop a layer of melted cheese that seemingly lacked the stringiness desired — still pretty decent however. The sous vide egg was just a teensy weenzy overdone; not as flowy as expected but still oozed a little lazy, gooey flow with the crusty and subtly sweet brioche. The cherry tomatoes on the side gave it a soft burst of good tangy, sweet cleanse when the bacon jam gets overwhelming, though the mesclun salad on the side is pretty ordinary and nothing to shout about. Still, it\'s pretty comforting and given its location away from the crowded cafe areas, this is a pretty decent spot to enjoy a quiet, quality brunch alone.
Expertly pulled, Stamping Ground Coffee possibly does one of the best cups that I have ever had using Papa Pahelta\'s Throwback blend which consist on beans from Indian and Brazilian origins. The result from the Flat White here would be this well-balanced cup where it\'s not too strong not milky, carrying a little citrus-sy notes on first taste but compensates with a smoky, chocolatey and nutty flavour profile thereafter with quite a clean finish. Possibly one of the coffees I would really travel down for.
snagged these from Public Garden for my quick coffee fix at home!😌 *smooth but slightly acidic. 
Thank you for the tip off that they are open today @caramyeeelle 😁😁😁!
Even though the force was strong in alluring me towards ordering their cold brew or flat white, I did not cave in to the temptation and insisted on my healthy beverage. Fortunately, it turned out well as the Chia Seed Pomegranate was easy to drink, not too sweet and the chia seeds definitely filled my stomach, which made me stay away from snacks the entire evening.
I grabbed my fix by redeeming The Wake Up Call through the Sugar app. I like that the cold brew is full-bodied and just a wee bit acidic, though I added my own soy milk later to cut down on the sourness. Have not tried the other two that I\'ve bought so will update the info once I do. Grab ur caffeine dose today! #Burpple
Need something that\'s cooling and refreshing! Stamping Ground Coffee does not serve coffee only, they also sell homemade bottled drinks that make a perfect refreshing pick-me-up drink during the day for non coffee drinkers. This pomegranate drink is super refreshing, loaded with these amazing magical little tapioca-like gel chia seeds in it. They don\'t actually have a flavor of their own but it pack maximum nutrients with minimal calories, making them a perfect addition to any healthy diet. It also help to lose weight! Guess I will need this a lot! Haha!
$6 / $7 for black and white! They\'ve got other options for non-coffee drinkers too - chia seed honey yuzu / chia seed coconut anyone? 
This White Cold Brew ($7) is smooth and silky, indeed.
Stamping Ground Coffee is a takeaway coffee joint offering CBD folks in Telok Ayer a good caffeine fix. Aside from their Cold Brew Coffee which comes in Black ($6) and White ($7), you can also opt for one of their non-caffeinated drinks such as their Chia Seed Pomegranate ($6) or Almond Nut Milk ($8). Go for the White if that’s available, but if they are out, try the Almond Nut Milk with an added shot of espresso – some may say it\'s even better.
I might have just found my favourite hangout for Cold Brews #nofilter #wewantsugar
the well-balanced pomegranate did not overwhelm my tastebud. chia seeds added a tapioca-like texture but trust me, u cannot even tell that u are swallowing a full load of them. and do you know that chia seeds have tonnes of nutrients with only a bit of calories?! oh and it can even help to lose weight 😂\n<br />totally perfect for the crazy weather today!
along the slope up club street lies this new coffee place. time to check them out maybe.

In love with this cafe for their deco and ambience.
like their design? do check them out
The flavour of the almond milk was rich and it tasted creamy as well, probably due to the almond being soaked for a longer period!
☕☕☕
There\'s always peace in a cup of coffee.
Love them! 😋
I am so glad that the coffee tastes as good. Lovely hidden gem!! What a great way to start the day!
have a good week yall!
Wake Up Call (SGD 5) - fruity and not too acidic. My cup of coffee.
