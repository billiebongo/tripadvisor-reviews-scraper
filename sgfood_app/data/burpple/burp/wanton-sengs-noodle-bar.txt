I\'d go back for these noodles, but best to avoid the lunch crowd.\n<br />I\'m not sure what\'s so special about this \"Combo\" set that\'s basically a \"Twosome\" Noodle set ($7.5) with an additional side of 5-minute egg, veges &amp; shitake mushrooms‚Äîkinda steep to pay an additional $7.5 for an egg and veges. ü§î Did I miss something? Maybe if it was an onsen egg I\'d be more impressed. But if you\'re going there for noodles, just get the Twosome or Threesome imo.\n<br />#WantonSG
Heard so much reviews about this, I just had to try. A twosome noodles comes at $7.50, with their signature char siew and siew yok. While I heard great reviews of the char siew, I personally found it a tad tough and dry. The siew yok though was cracking good!
Attas but still fun place where you get to mix in your own sauces into the noodles. We all loved the combination of chilli and dark sauce (Malaysia boleh!!!). A must order here is the pork belly - crackling good I love it!!!
$6 and extra noodles at $1. Yum. The pork was good and but I preferred my noodles to have more bite to it. 
For lunch last Friday, the foodie gang got together for some caf√©-esque wanton noodles and pictured is the Two-Some ($7.50) which comes with the thin yellow egg noodles with aburi slow-cooked pork belly (char siew), double roasted pork belly (siu yok), wontons, spring onions and fried shallots. You also get to mix in the sauces by yourself and what\'s available are dark soya sauce, green chillis, chilli sauce and of cause the all-important deep fried crispy pork lard.
An alluring sight for hungry souls ‚Äì 12-hour slow-cooked pork belly glazed in an umami sauce, roasted and torched. That caramelisation on the juicy, fatty pork is just divine.
Takeaway prices are cheaper so consider dabao-ing to Amoy (or wherever else) since the seating space in the restaurant is pretty small #burpple #foodporn #foodspotting
Non work day calls for something high!\n<br />Funny that the 2 aunties sitting next to me, kept giving me looks for the drink. Bet they don\'t have colleagues who drank soju and makgeolli during lunchtime. Miss those days.\n<br />ThreeSome ($8.50)\n<br />Light crispy roast pork. Char Siew a bit dry.\n<br />Cosmoy ($16)\n<br />Reminded me of an adult version of ribena.\n<br />Available at @Wanton.SG\n<br />Don\'t forget to add condiments such as crispy pork lard a and chilli sauce to the noodles. Help yourself to the flask of hot soup on the counter.\n<br />|\n<br />Wanton, Seng\'s Noodle Bar\n<br />Address üè† : 52 Amoy Street, Singapore üá∏üá¨ 069 878\n<br />Tel ‚òéÔ∏è : 6221 1336\n<br />Open üíà : \n<br />Mon - Thu : 11.30am - 2.30pm, 6pm - 11pm\n<br />Fri : 11.30am - 2.30pm, 6pm - 1pm\n<br />Sat : 5pm - 1am\n<br />MRT üöá : Tanjong Pagar (EW15)
Had a sudden crave for wanton noodles! Gotta head down to 52 amoy street for this! The Aburi Pork Belly has been slow cooked for 12 hours. Expect soft and melt in your mouth feel. Definetly a good meal.
Wanton noodles with lots of sides!\n<br />Aburi Pork Belly is a must eat! \n<br />Tried the salted egg chicken wings. Power lah! \n<br />Nudles for  $1, more than enough.
Ordered sides to go. \n<br />Totally in love with the salted egg sauce. This is the right taste that I\'ve been searching for! Definetly worth trying. 6 pieces for $9.00!
Irony to the name, the wanton served wasn\'t at all fantastic but the well marinated char siew was flavorful and obtain a melt in your mouth texture, roast pork was not too fatty and its crackling! Noodle was springy as well! Create your very own taste by concocting your own noodle\'s chilli sauce! Another gem find in the CBD area! 
But hot chef is away on a holiday. Haha awesome possum twosome for lunch. This time around, I helped myself to the pork lards! üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª #wanton #wantonseng #wantonsg #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgfood #amoystreet
Pretty good noodles at $1 per bowl. The dishes were mundane zhi char flare though. Howbeit, the char siew is top notch!!!!
Terribly missing the lard-coated wanton noodles in Bangkok, but these $1 noodles from @wanton.sg are equally scrumptious. They come perfumed with scallion oil and fried shallots, and the secret to making them even more irresistible is by tossing in pieces of lard and drizzling on even more of the liquid grease that are handily on standby at every table.
Their noodles and chilli is so good, reminds me of kolo mee
Their version of char siew is da bomb. Roasted and torched to perfection 
Uh huh. Because nothing is sexier than stuffing your mouth with egg with runny yolk ensconced by a generous coat of crisp panko-crumbed sausage meat, and then down it all with cold beer. Ok, that\'s all.
Those that are swathed in a luscious coat of grainy salted egg yolk sauce that bursts with umami and makes you smack your lips constantly. So much fun to eat. Ok, that\'s all.
The smokiness in these slices is just addicting that we ordered two platters. The meat/fat ratio in the pork belly is flawlessly balanced as they meld beautifully together after having been slow-cooked for 12 hours and then roasted and torched for that inimitable and sexy char. The addition of the coriander bouquet is ingenious ‚Äì the herb\'s distinct aroma and freshness help cut away the subtle greasiness, not that I mind. And that slab of katsu in the background...all katsu should be the Sengkatsu! Unlike the char siew which uses the belly, the katsu features the divinely sublime jowl. Sorry, darling, those mille feuille katsu have got nothing on this beast. The crust is light and crisp, and gives you an almost delusional healthy illusion because it reeks of no oil. How classy. The dragon sauce it comes with ‚Äî there\'s prawn paste, I think ‚Äî is a tad either-you-love-it-or-hate-it. While I don\'t mind it, I prefer my meat virginal. Ok, that\'s all.
This heaven sent bowl of a noodle is only $1 ‚Äî you then opt to have it with a symphony of sinfully good pork dishes ‚Äî and it is just cray cray. The texture is amazingly qq and has such a great bite that makes your teeth just work that little bit of pleasurable overtime. Beautifully dressed with deep-fried shallots, spring onion, pork fat and dash of soy sauce, each table gets an unlimited serving of pork lard too. Unorgasmically, the ones we had were no longer crispy...such an anti climax. But the noodles is legit. Ok, that\'s all.
For roughly $6.50-$7.50 (pretty decent I think) you get a big bowl of noodles with tender meat (your choice - char siew, pork ribs, roasted pork belly) PLUS they provide unlimited lapok!!! I\'m sold üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª However, the noodles were quite dry though cos im used to eating saucier wanton mee but nonetheless pretty yummy!! Wish the pork ribs weren\'t so huge cos kinda tough to suck the bone dry unless you eat with your hands. Will recommend to go for the \"two-some\" cos you get siewyok + charsiew and their charsiew is like kong bak pau kind!!!! I LOVE!!!! And I went during lunch time so there was happy hour on drinks - beer + wanton mee is something I\'d never think of but it was gr8 finishing off the meal with a gulp of beer + the weather was SO hot too ‚òÄÔ∏è
After an indulgent dinner at Park Bench Deli, another beer might not be the answer for you and your friends, but the Ju Hua cocktail ($14) at Wanton certainly is. Open till 1am on Fridays, this might sound like an unlikely spot to get your drink on (since it really is a noodle bar), but seriously, you need to get your bum here. Spiked with vodka and served in a metal pot, this ice-cold chrysanthemum tea strikes the perfect balance between sweetness and an alcoholic punch. The best part is drinking from these little tea cups, of which five are filled to the brim with one pot. Order one pot at a time, this way you\'ll have ice cold drinks throughout the night! Have some fun sipping on these cool babies as you digest, and thank the stars it\'s Friday.
One of the few places in Singapore serving dry noodle without way too many sauces in it. They serve the meat generously, but I would add a bit soy sauce to the noodle just to up the flavour a bit more.
|\n<br />For such a wanton Mee eatery to open at Amoy Street, required a lot of effort and \"courage\" and this place did a pretty good job for its crowd. The meat items weren\'t the best but a lot least the \"Mee\" could make it. (Didn\'t want to nag too much on the not so good part) .\n<br />|\n<br />A cool interior design with upside mirror which could see the boldness of the eaters. Dark and dimmed light which created a good \"feel\" for drinkers (like me) to chill.
|\n<br />The intention was to put all of these in one single bowl but we might had over-ordered. Generally the meat dishes weren\'t too bad but it could be better.
This time at \"Wanton\", an upmarket noodles eatery cum bar on Amoy Street. The spicy quail was the item I liked best followed closely by the herbal-tasting slow braised pork knuckles. #veronicaphuaeats #wantonsg #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #BurppleTastemakers #sgeats #eatoutsg #instafoodsg #sgfoodies #sgfood #modsin
Great for rainy days or if you\'re in the mood for hot herbal soup with a ginormous serving of fatty pork knuckle abundant with gelatinous goodness. 
It\'s always good fun to hang out with Burpple Tastemakers because we are united in our passion for food. Whether it is in the eating of it, taking pictures or talking about it (usually with all three happening at once!), we can\'t help but have a ball of a time. So, quite naturally, after we were done at the invited tasting at The Spiffy Dapper, we crossed the road to partake in dinner part two. \n<br />For our (unhosted) session at Wanton, the upmarket noodles eatery cum bar on Amoy Street, we ordered their \"COMBowl Set\" ($12++) and a few small plates (or \"Snacks\" as they are termed here) to share.\n<br />The \"COMBowl\" came with handmade noodles (al dente eggy strands - pretty good), aburi pork (blackened \"char siu\" that\'s too fatty), roast pork (sadly, it\'s let down by an awful rubbery skin), \"gangster kai lan\" (decent enough blanched veg with some garlic and sauce) and a 5-minute egg with a semi-hard yolk.\n<br />For snacks, we selected both the boiled and deepfried \"wantons\" ($6++ and $7++ respectively for nine pieces each). A few of them were arranged on the noodles for the above pic (yes, haha, we are weird that way). Also, we could not say no to the Salted Egg Chicken Wings ($10++), Slow Braised Pork Knuckle ($12++) and Spicy Quail ($10++). I was not fond of the wings personally as the sauce and not-crispy-enough wings didn\'t gel well in my opinion. Fairing much better with my tastebuds were the pork knuckle with its strong herbal flavour and the crispy quail that packed surprising heat.
Expensive wanton mee - got the Roasted Pork Belly ($6.95). Was glad that the portion wasn\'t too small and they were quite generous with the roasted pork belly but it was a disappointment (where\'s the crackling, where?!), and certain parts had a strange char taste. Dumplings were meh too. Noodles tasted pretty good though, loved the texture and taste, made even better with the chilli which the service staff hinted me to try.
Lunch treat for $7.50 with generous amount of noodles, pork belly and wanton is definitely worth the queue! The soup was free flow in a flask! Eating Wanton Mee in a bar is a whole new experience. 
If you are up for something simple, nice and inexpensive, this simple combination of noodle, soup and small dumplings is good for lunch or light supper. You can enjoy as much soup as you want.
Wanton Mee w Roast Pork. S$6.50. Loving the flame grilled roast pork. Also comes in Char Siew version (which I prefer more) that taste a bit like japanese grilled pork cheek. üëçüèª
Noodles were under seasoned and dense. The pork belly was cooked well but had no crackling and (again) lacked seasoning. The dish failed to pack a punch considering it costs more than double what I would pay for an excellent plate of normal wanton noodles at a hawker center. \n<br />The place also has serious operations issues. I was told I could not place my order because the wantons were not ready but 2 mins later they\'re taking someone else\'s orders and telling them the wantons are not ready. Same guy who served me and them. Not cool at all. \n<br />#burpple
I tot it is obvious. lol. Wanton Mee definitely. Any type. \n<br />So must check out hip wanton shop at CBD...\n<br />Noodles - Ok\n<br />Chilli - Yes Yes\n<br />Char Siew - Emm\n<br />Dumplings - No No\n<br />Eggs - Yes \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/07/14/wantonsg
This new noodle bar along Amoy Street is a brave attempt at modernising a classic hawker favourite. For dinner, start with a bowl of nudles $2 and order up some sides to share. We loved the nudles (note the pun) the most, lightly tossed in oil, even better with their special chilli sauce. The roasted pork belly was a little of a letdown being a tad bland, although the wanton was decent enough. But the batalong egg, their version of scotch egg was pretty good, especially with the wasabi mayo sauce. Overall it was quite the pleasant experience despite being slightly pricey. While you\'re at it, do try their Ju Hua cocktail, a refreshing chrysanthemum tea infused with vodka. #hipsterhawker indeed. 
It\'s all gentle, floral and familiar until the ending note which hits you hard, gloves off.
Wanton mee gets a modern spin at Wanton, a noodle bar (with mainly bar seats) opened by the people behind Seng\'s Wanton Noodle and Pluck. At lunch, come to this Amoy Street spot to enjoy their basic wanton noodles with char siew ($5.50 small / $6.50 medium), where the springy noodles and satisfying char siew don\'t disappoint. The dinner service starts you off with Nudles, i.e. plain Seng\'s noodles dressed in oil ($2). You then choose from unique toppings such as Fried Spicy Whole Quail ($14) or the Steamed Baby Kailan with Gangster Sauce, Braised Mushrooms &amp; Scallops ($10). Wash your noodles down with their vodka-spiked chrysanthemum cocktail Ju Hua ($14 for a pot) or the Modern Times Coffee Stout ($16) to relax after work!
for the price, you would at least expect more thought, tastier and creative ingredients. sadly I received none.
Comes in two sizes; Small and Medium which according to the staff \"small is basic size and medium is a bit more\". Comes with huge chunks of pork, fresh prawns, shrimp wantons and free flow pork lard. Here, condiments are up to your own preferences; Black/Light soy sauce, Shiok Chili and sesame oil is placed on the table for you to tune to your preferred taste. Noodles are fine, and while it was decent enough it doesn\'t really justify its $9 price tag for it seemed to lack anything fancy to wow us over especially when there are competitors such as A Noodle Story which offers something less pedestrian for less nearby; perhaps dinner might be a wiser option. Soup was horribly bland; as though cabbage soaked in water, and the condiment pumps were somewhat faulty; some did not leak from the right spots while some got stuck. 10% service charge is applicable here, though a tad ridiculous for the amount of service rendered; our glasses of water came halfway through when we were eating, the soup came after we finished and that we had to order at the counter ourselves. Guess there is just a few things they need to adjust for now.
Chose the busiest hour to visit Wanton for lunch on their official opening day. Sat by the bar and caught all the actions in the open kitchen (rather messy and tad disorganized), but it\'s probably one of those newly opened jitters, totally understandable.
Well, I\'m in luck because the minute old gourmet wanton noodle bar Wanton opens TODAY. Lunch menu is straightforward while the dinner menu allows you to customize and pick your own toppings!
Order (more than) 1 bowl of their S$1 Noodles, Salted Egg Wings, and their 18-hour slow cooked Aburi Pork Belly üòçüòçüòç deadly! #Burpple

What an indulgent treat. The meat soaks up all the gorgeous fragrance of the five spice and becomes a beautiful textural delight. So much love. Ok, that\'s all.
Yummy noodles are just the beginning. There\'s also the 12-hour slow roasted pork ribs that are melt-in-your-mouth and the oh-so-tender char siew. And the pi√®ce de r√©sistance? Servings of lovely crispy lard alongside the sauces! #foodie #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #instafood #instagood #burpple
Chef recommendation Aburi Pork Belly(Char Siew) did just enough probably earn a return trip. However, no choice of noodles will make me think twice as I am a Mee pok lover. Small portion of noodle for $1 made dinner just filling enough.
