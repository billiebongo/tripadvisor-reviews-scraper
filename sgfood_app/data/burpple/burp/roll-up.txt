And of course, I went straight for my favourite- Pistol &amp; Mortar. #burpple #burppletastemaker #rollupsg
Awesome Indian wraps ‚Äì 4 filled with tandoor-grilled meats and 1 stuffed with spiced vegetables. All that flanked by piles of addictive masala spiced shoestring fries. If you\'re in the Boat Quay vicinity late tonight and looking for supper, drop by here to pad your tummy cos it\'s open till 1am on Fridays and Saturdays!
4.5 munchies: Marinated overnight with 14 spices and ingredients including yoghurt and red chilli powder, the chicken thigh was skewered and cooked traditionally in a tandoor. Juices were retained in the nicely grilled chicken tikka ‚Äì tender and fatty on the inside and slightly charred and crispy on the outside. I also loved how they were boneless, and the mint sauce drizzle that wowed us all. Pair it with BrewDog Punk IPA on the tap and you\'re set for a good night!
The five of us certainly can\'t get enough of the mildly sweet, creamy mint sauce featured prominently in all the kebabs at this cosy one-month-old place at Boat Quay. Thank you, Gaurav (@rollupsg) and Burpple, for the warm hospitality and exotic beer tasting tonight! #BurppleTastemakers
And that homemade mint sauce was just.... Wow. The sweet creamy texture complemented the spices of the kebabs- a perfect marriage between the two. |\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the invite and @rollupsg for hosting us tonight! |\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #rollupsg
TGIF gets even better with kebabs &amp; beer! If you\'re hitting boat quay area, do check out Roll Up for their tender tandoori, mouth-watering mint sauce and beery unique beer selection. Featured here from right to left are the Pistol &amp; Motar (Chichen Tikka), Creme Poulet (Chicken Malai Tikka) and Fish-ti-cuffs (Fish Tikka). The crowd favourite of the night was definitely the Pistol &amp; Motar. We were blown away by the smokiness of the meat and the fiery blend of Indian spices. For those who are worried about the spice level, be rest assured that the spice level is toned down by the complementing vegetables and mint sauce. Also, order a portion of masala fries for sharing. It\'s so so addictive! [This tasting is hosted by Roll Up].

It was quite a sizeable portion and well seasoned. One negative was that towards the end a small cockroach climbed up onto our table and interrupted our feasting...\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #kebab #burpple #cbd
Chicken Tikka.  $10 set with jpassport prime pass.
Thinking that kebab rolls won\'t fill up your stomach? Not for the kebabs at @rollupsg ! 85% of the kebab roll is filled with meat and the remaining is covered with vegetables and sides. They marinated kebabs overnight , slow cooked the meat, weigh every kebab in each roll during preparation to ensure 100% quality! üíØ‚ùóÔ∏èI personally love both chicken kebabs as the meat in both rolls were tender and juicy and the spices just made them so yummy!\n<br />.\n<br />There is upcoming menu next week with massive spicy version kebabs! Find more info at @rollupsg.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @karlnch and @rollupsg for this food tasting! I wasn\'t really into kebabs but I love it now! ‚òùÔ∏èüòç\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #singaporefood #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instagramfood #instafood #exploresingapore #rollupsg #kebabs
Though I must say my heart lies with the {Fish-ti-cuffs} ... Case of the ex, they say„ÄÇ
The spices are pretty robust too as it is all housemade and from scratch, though the wraps themselves are perry decent too and nicely toasty :)\n<br />#rollupsg #chickentikka #wraps #sgcafe #sgfood #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #spices
You can now head over to Roll Up, which is opened till 1am on Fridays and Saturdays (Mon-Thu till 11pm), to satisfy your hunger pangs and end the night in the most rightly fashion.\n<br />.\n<br />At the most recent tasting, we were treated to a table full of freshly hand-rolled kebabs that contain a different type of protein (vegetarian option available), their in-house mint sauce, onion and lettuce. I was literally raving over the mint sauce the entire night as it was so darn good and paired impeccably with the different kinds of meats.\n<br />.\n<br />My favourite of them all has definitely got to be the Pistol &amp; Mortar ($11) Chicken Tikka. The boneless chicken are marinated in 12 Indian spices before skewering and going into a tandoor. You can also opt to upsize your meal by adding a portion of the masala fries ($3) which are tossed in their own house blend of spices and served with, you guessed right, the mint sauce! For the health conscious, you can skip the carb by getting the chicken tikka without the soft flour wrap. There is also a selection of imported beer and liquor to pair with your kebabs.\n<br />.\n<br />This was a hosted meal by Gaurav @rollupsg and many thanks to @Burpple for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 76 Circular Road, Singapore 049430\n<br />============================\n<br />Now playing: üé∂ Bad Meets Evil - Lighters üé∂\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #foodporn #foodphoto #makan #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
