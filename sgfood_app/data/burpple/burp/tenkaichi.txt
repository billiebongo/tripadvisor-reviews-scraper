\nTo be able to feast on unlimited servings of Wagyu beef at the new Tenkaichi in Marina Square, coupled with a fantastic view of MBS did make my Saturday. For $75++(PH, Fri and weekend price), I would dare to say this is the most value-for-money Japanese BBQ ala-carte buffet in Singapore in terms of quality. My advice - fix your eyes and tummy on the BBQ meat items, scallops and beef sashimi. Just skip the cooked food(mostly processed stuff) and others. 
I wonder why I was born in the year of Rabbit, makes no sense. 😏😂 High quality wagyu beef short ribs at @tenkaichi_sg ! LOVE! 😍😍#EileenFoodTasting #TenkaichiSG #Beef #Buffet #Japanese #Burpple
One of my favourite item - Buta Karubi a.k.a Pork Belly. Look at those layers 😍😍. When my love for meat travels far and wide... Real \"meaty\" reputation. 😂😂 Thank you @tenkaichi_sg !! #EileenWantsToCampHereForever #BringBackTheFats #HealthyFats #FatFatMeatSeries #PorkBelly #BBQ #EileenFoodTasting #OngsLaiJiak #Burpple
In conjunction with the nation\'s SG50, Tenkaichi Japanese BBQ restaurant is introducing the best Wagyu beef buffet experience at only $50+ on weekdays, or top up $5 if you\'re dining during the weekends.
Used groupon. Thought the buffet was quite worth for the variety of cuts of beef, pork &amp; chicken (which we didn\'t order), sashimi (ok only 3 types but that\'s all I need: salmon, seabream &amp; tuna), squid prawn etc if you like to bbq seafood. We also had 100g each of wagyu beef, decent marbling - so tender! I liked that the marination wasn\'t too much or too salty. They have a cooked food section (breaded prawn was crispy tho the prawn was almost nonexistent, sushi, soba, rice, takoyaki etc.). If I\'m not wrong there were additional costs for drinks.
$64.80 on weekdays, $69.80 on weekend. Biggest collection of wagyu meats at a jap buffet ive seen.
They recently introduced \"The Best of Japan\" BBQ Ala-Carte Premium Buffet featuring Wagyu beef, giant scallops, japanese oysters and more that guarantee to be the lowest in town. If you can find anywhere similar in offerings and lower in price, Tenkaichi will beat it by 10%. 
Sounds like a very good deal.
Had wagyu shabu shabu buffet the other day for Father\'s Day celebration and it was not a let down! 
Glad to see familiar faces too! \n<br />Can you guess what this is? ☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodporn #foodcoma #foodphotography #foodgasm #sgfoodie #sgrestaurant  #vscocam #yummy #sgfood #japanesefood #sgfoodstylist #sgfoodblogger #likesforlikes #sgfood #foodstyling #foodstylist #foodplating #likesforlikes #burpple #foodblogger #f52grams #foodie #vscocam #dessert #sweetooth #MSQeats #tenkaichi_sg

I was lucky enough to get a medium-rare when the rest of the table\'s were medium, but the cut could have been better. #MSQeats #tenkaichi
This was a massive crowd-pleaser. Pity the bones. #MSQeats #tenkaichi
Wagyu Rosu score 5+ is $19.90!
Check out the marbling on Karubi, Rosu, Nakaochi Karubi. It melts in your mouth and definitely worth the price.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #sgjapanese #whati8today #japanesefoodsg #igsgfood #igsg #bbq #yakinikusg #tenkaichi #tenkaichisg #sgig #sgigfood #beefgasm #wagyu #stfood #burpple #instafood_sg
Ah, the best time to go to @tenkaichi_sg for their WAGYU BUFFET with my rumbling belly.
Okay actually 6 different varieties, all presented on this plate! Stay tuned for more pictures on their wagyu sashimi and other proteins!
Though we were not thrilled with the short ribs and lamb cuts, the wagyu beef slices are pretty good and need a tad of salt and pepper seasoning to bring out the flavours from the intricate marbling of the protein. For the deluxe Waygu beef buffet pricing, it is ideal for those who likes Waygu and having a free flow of this :)\n<br />#Waygu #beef #japanesebuffet #grill #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple #sgbuffet

Eat it real and raw. Chewing effort is unnecessary (you can if you want to 😅), just let the slices melt in your mouth. Can\'t get enough of the heart healthy fats! 😍😍 #TenKaiChi #OngsLaiJiak #EileenFoodTasting #EileenWantsToCampHereForever #WagyuBeef #Japanese #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker
