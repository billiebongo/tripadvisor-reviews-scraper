Don‚Äôt be surprised, you can also find beautifully plated desserts here at Brothers in Fine Food. We had a hard time deciding they all looked so good, but went with the Nagasari.

Little caf√© located at level two in Tampines CC. Industrial kinda theme. Menu was not much to choose from but the quality of food was not bad though. My meal for two was less than $50 if i can remember correctly .

With exposed ceilings and long wooden benches, this Muslim-owned cafe in Tampines West Community Club is an industrial chic hangout perfect for dinners or weekend brunches. The space is owned by the same guys behind Penny University, so you can expect good food and coffee ‚Äî bonus points for their friendly staff! A generous piece of seared sous vide steak served with fluffy scrambled eggs and crispy fries, the Butcher\'s Daughter ($14) is without a doubt one of the stars on their brunch menu (available 9am-5pm on weekends). Another winner is the Peanut Butter Jelly Toast ($10), which sandwiches peanut butter, homemade summer berries compote and sliced bananas among two slices of toasted fresh brioche ‚Äî simple but good! At dinner, consider the Kelantan Roasted Chicken ($16) glazed with spicy coconut cream. Sip on the Spiked Muddy Espresso ($6.50) that comes sweetened with gula Melaka, or the Jaffa Orange Mocha ($6), which sports a lovely citrusy brightness amidst the earthy notes of the coffee and chocolate.\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Siming T\n<br />*Muslim-owned
The lamb meat is off the bones and is extremely tender üòã. Rest assure the district smell when eating lamb is minimized with the spicy tomato reduction.

Brothers in Fine food is situated on the second floor of Tampines West Community Centre. The interior is small and cozy. It is a halal cafe without any gst or service charge. Tried the following items:                                                                  Peach Iced Tea ($6.50) Thai Milk Tea ($6.50)            The Peach Iced Tea was served with slices of peaches in it. Had the Thai Milk Tea ice blended. It was fragrant without being overly sweet.              Kelantan Roasted Chicken ($16)                                Half a chicken, sous vide and roasted, Kelantan perchik spicy coconut cream glaze. The sauce was so good and matched well with the tender chicken.                                                                         Beef Steak ($15)                                                          Sous vide, served with beetroot thyme pur√©e. Love how the steak was marinated, the slices were tender and juicy. The beetroot thyme pur√©e was a perfect match and brought out the sweetness of the steak.                                                  Strawberry Shortcake ($8.50)                                    The Strawberry Shortcake was served in a very big slice. It was dense and tasty.

Only managed to order this Red Velvet Hot Chocolate cos kitchen closed to prepare for dinner. I don\'t understand WTS is wrong with these kind of cafes. I don\'t see other places rejecting food orders also. FYI there\'s like only 3-4 people around when i was there seated at 1 table. No obvious taste of red velvet in this hot chocolate but the pinkish tone does make the drink pretty instagrammable. 
With exposed ceilings and long wooden benches, this Muslim-owned cafe in Tampines West Community Club oozes casual chic industrial vibes that are perfect for lazy weekend brunches. Bonus points for their friendly staff! Visit for the Butcher\'s Daughter ($14), a dish that\'s available only on their weekend brunch menu (9am-5pm). Expect a generous piece of seared sous vide steak cooked to your preferred doneness, served with scrambled eggs and fries on the side. The Burpple community loves how juicy and tasty the meat is; the fluffy eggs and spot-on crispy fries are a happy plus! While you\'re here, consider ordering the Spiked Muddy Espresso ($6.50) that comes sweetened with gula Melaka.\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Cedric Lim
Much has been said about their items in the brunch menu, but this Peanut Butter Jelly Toast (S$10.00) appears to be a much underrated comfort food in this Muslim-owned enclave.
$9 - slightly small portion but it\'s not bad 3.5/5
When I came, I could not locate where the cafe is at exactly. When I finally found it, I didn\'t know where was the entrance door lol. I can overlook these both. So my friend and I ordered two sets of Butcher\'s daughter which cost about $14 for each plate? It consists of beef slices where we can decide on the done-ness. I chose medium rare and it was really good! Not dry but juicy and tasty! The fries was seasoned well and it\'s crispy outside and soft inside! I loved both the beef and fries actually! Salad was good too with the balsamic vinegar dressing! The scrambled eggs was cooked so well, better than MacDonalds or any other scrambled eggs I\'ve tasted by far! The eggs can decide between scrambled and sunny side up as well. The lychee iced tea ($6) was just right as well. I had quite a wonderful meal overall.
From the same guys behind Penny University, this Muslim-owned cafe in Tampines West Community Club draws the crowds for its comforting fusion cafe fare and affordable prices ‚Äî perfect for family meals. With exposed ceilings and long wooden benches, its setting is industrial chic without being too in-your-face about it, making for really laidback vibes. If it\'s your first time here, go for the Butcher\'s Daughter ($14) on the weekend brunch menu (available on weekends, 9am to 5pm). The generous piece of seared sous vide steak, cooked well and served with fluffy scrambled eggs and crispy fries, makes for a tasty protein-rich plate. Alternatively, try the Moroccan Baked Eggs ($12). Mixed through with beef, the dish is flavourful, with a good kick of spice, and the sourdough on the side is made for mopping up all that delicious gravy. Tummies filled, sit back and sip on a cup of Jaffa Orange Mocha ($6) or the Spiked Muddy Espresso ($6.50) that comes sweetened with gula Melaka.\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Dex Neo
Finally using the quote \"true friends share calories\" - drove one of my girl friends here for desserts; the brownies plate and peanut butter jelly waffles ($12 nett each) particularly.\n<br />The former was essentially rich, dense, melt in your mouth chocolate fudge with surprise bites of burnt caramel (?); very indulgent so do not be fooled by its size. Paired off with a scoop of banoffee ice cream that tried to balance the richness of the 2 gooey chocolate brownie bars. \n<br />The latter was slightly disappointing-factoring in how we were 3/4 filled from our brownies when it arrived. While the fruit jelly- jam over and around the waffle was appetising, I\'d still classify this as forgettable waffles.

@that_dex needed to try out this new place. Heard they started penny university and now brought a new cafe to the Tampines area so we had to try it. The Moroccan baked eggs came with a generous serving of lovely sourdough bread. The dish was full of Mediterranean Flavours, agood kick of spice and made hearty with by the beef and egg. My pan was wiped clean down to the last drop cos it was so good and prices are very reasonable! Will definitely be back again. #burpple @picnicsundayvintage @jiaqi_sg @coolheart @burpple
Slightly unnerving name aside, just WHUT? A $14 steak that comes with moist, fluffy scrambled eggs and crispy fries? You\'d expect the steak to be tough or full of gristle, but this was a totally respectable slab of meat that will definitely satisfy one\'s simple beef cravings.üôå 
Butcher\'s Daughter ($14)
Mediterranean Breakfast ($15)
Surprised at this relaxed eatery tucked away in Tampines CC on the second floor. Aside from some usual suspects on the brunch menu (Peruvian Eggs) , we tried other unique brunch options like dashi noodles, butchers daughter (sou vee beef and eggs!) and Mediterranean platter. Great addition to east side weekend eateries and will definitely pop by to try the innovative dinner menu soon!
Spiked Muddy Expresso ($6.50)
[Halal] Finally back at this place to have a go at their mains! This dish is basically a thyme-herbed eggplant boat of rice, topped with marinara, parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, all which are then baked to a golden finish. I quite liked the bouncy, chunky, slightly gooey textures of the eggplant, though I felt it didn\'t really add any element of surprise, adventure or excitement to an otherwise regular baked rice. ü§î (6.5/10)
üòó\n<br />The first thoughts that crossed my mind was where\'s my steak sauce? But to my surprise the steak held up on its own. It\'s well seasoned and juicy. Yums.\n<br />-\n<br />Too bad Monster was there during brunch. Looking forward to try out the dinner menu.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #brothersinfinefood
[Halal] I dropped by this place earlier today only to be greeted with a disappointing piece of news - that they only start serving mains from 6pm. Thankfully, they have appetizers available!
[Halal] For 10 dollars, you\'ll get a handful of chicken chunks, some greens smattered with kosher salt, and a blue cheese dip sitting in the centre.
Soft-shell Crab.
Comfort food definitely for this. Sour cream, garden greens, potatoes, simple ingredients makes the best food! This wasnt charged to the total bill as they forgot to order for us so we had this on the house.
Situated at Tampines West CC, level 2, its a small space designed with an rustic industrial theme with huge industrial lights at the counter, service is good &amp; food is good too! Will definitely be back, their menus will constantly be changed. 
Tender salmon for salmon lovers, it was a little too soft for me but if you love salmon you\'ll love this! Couscous was a little on the drier side. ($15 or lesser)
I love this! Tinge of fresh orange taste to this mocha right here, it brought out the taste of this mocha, comforting yet surprising if you get what I meant.. just try it and you\'ll know! ($6)
From the guys behind Penny University comes this cafe in Tampines West Community Club. It may only be a few weeks old, but the Muslim-owned establishment is already drawing crowds for its comforting fusion cafe fare and comfortable ambience ‚Äî perfect for group gatherings and family brunches. Begin with starters, many of which have a distinct Middle Eastern flair like the Charred Aubergines ($6.50). Smoky and garlicky, this comes with yoghurt, za\'atar spices and pomegranate seeds. Move on to tasty and substantial Asian-inspired mains like Soft Shell Crab Burger ($13.50), Iga Bakar ($18, grilled beef ribs) and a stellar Salmon Fillet ($14), which comes with brown butter miso sauce, curried breadcrumbs and Israeli couscous. If space permits, dig into the Greek Yoghurt Panna Cotta ($8), or just sit back and sip on a cup of Jaffa Orange Mocha ($6). \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua
Served with poached pears, homemade honeycomb crunch, seasonal fruits and lavender honey. It\'s pretty decent sounding but I do believe that there is room to improve; I actually liked the smooth Panna Cotta especially for how the lavender honey gives it a whiff of sweet, floral flavours with the crunchy bits of honeycomb that adds yet another dimension in terms of sweetness and crunchiness. The poached pears are the one that requires a little refining ‚Äî soft to the bite but pretty bland overall with its watered down flavours; perhaps needing a bit of caramelization or some sort of reduction for more flavour.
I like it when cafes try to serve their own versions of Asian flavours ‚Äî this Iga Bakar is one good example where they serve a grilled beef rib (braised for 48 hours) with kecap manis reduction with polenta fries. I wasn\'t much of a fan of the polenta fries on the side for they tasted very much like salted tidbits but still decently crisp and fluffy, but the beef certainly was delicious with the sweet Kecap Manis despite it carrying just a slight gamey flavour profile; just that it could be more tender overall. What intrigued me the most was the crisp on the side; earthy yet spicy flavours like dried chili flakes in cracker form ‚Äî very interesting indeed but felt isolated from the whole dish for there seem to be nothing else on the plate to pair the crackers with.
Quite a rare dish to be found in a cafe ‚Äî pretty decent as well considering that the Aubergines were soft to bite and carried a nice hint of charred smokiness; all that while it\'s being balanced out with a creamy and thick yogurt dressing with a hint of garlicky flavours and za\'tar spices for a little savouriness, while the pomegranate seeds adds a little sour zing to lift all the flavours together. Sounds pretty unconventional but works!
Ordered this for novelty\'s sake but it\'s actually pretty good a drink to have ‚Äî taking the classic flavour combination of chocolate and orange, things get a little more chocolatey here (or maybe I hadn\'t had an actual cup of mocha for too long to compare it against with) but they have included Jaffa orange peels at the bottom of the drink for that citrusy zing. Definitely works for a casual cuppa to go along with the meal.
ü•©\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK TIPSüíÆ: Considering that it‚Äôs a halal certified cafe, the steak served by BFF was seared on both sides and remained juicy. Scrambled eggs was a little watery but it‚Äôs faultless in the taste department. Can‚Äôt go wrong with crispy thick cut fries and the entire dish is garnished with generous amount of salt and pepper. Pretty satisfying and for the price one pays, it‚Äôs a meal for those days when you are tight on cash. üç¥\n<br />.\n<br />Do come early in the weekends as they sold out many of their signatures when I visited in the late afternoon. Pity that they do not serve any sauce to go along with their food, any consolation it‚Äôs seasoned heavily. üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #bff #brothersinfinefood #halal #beef #steak #scrambledeggs #eggs #frites #fries #brunch #meatshow

Sous vide salmon ü§§, brown butter miso, giant couscous, pickled shallots.
Duck ragout pasta was my favorite among the dishes.. Everything from appearance to taste is well executed.. Eat and you will know.. Say no more..\n<br />The beetroot hummus is not too bad especially the texture of it.. but there is this particular spice inside the hummus that I really don\'t like.. Love the crunchiness of the baguette..\n<br />The salmon fillet is soft and the skin is slightly crispy.. Lying on a bed of giant couscous, like the chewy feel of the couscous.. The steak is lightly salted and grilled to perfect medium.. The beetroot puree is a good combination with the steak, wish there is more puree for the steak..\n<br />Lastly is the blue-colored sticky rice with coconut milk, fresh mango, pomegranate and pieces of biscuit.. Not too sweet.. In summary, it\'s a deconstructed Thai mango sticky rice.. #brothersinfinefood #duckragoutpasta #beetroothummous #bluestickyrice #salmonfillet #beefsteak #burpple #dinner #jaslynfoodinstagram

And it‚Äôs also my first time having pasta with duck! The result is... GOOD! This slightly thicker pasta has a al-dente texture with the rich tomato sauce deeply infused with it.

Now, there‚Äôs finally one and that you can place your faith in Brothers in Fine Food for their value-for-money seared beef, aptly named Butcher‚Äôs Daughter as not only do you get your proteins from the sous-vide beef, you get eggs done based on your preference and thick cut fries for the carbs. Definitely a worth it winner for me and absolutely warrants multiple returns for its .\n<br />_________________\n<br />Brothers in Fine Food\n<br />Address: 5, Tampines Avenue 3, Tampines West Community Centre, Unit 02-07, Singapore 529705\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #brothersinfinefood #halalsg #halalcafesg
Out of the brunch items that were served, I would recommend you get the Butcher‚Äôs Daughter ($14) for its sous-vide seared beef, eggs done your way and served with thick cut fries. For its price point, it‚Äôs definitely a worth it winner for me! Next up is the Builder‚Äôs Breakfast ($15), a hearty plate of all-things breakfast that you think of such as sausage, bacon, eggs, bread and the list goes on. Finally, a little on the heavier side would be the Moroccan Baked Eggs ($12), which in my opinion a tad too spicy for my liking.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Brothers in Fine Food\n<br />Address: 5, Tampines Avenue 3, Tampines West Community Centre, Unit 02-07, Singapore 529705\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #brothersinfinefood #halalsg #halalcafesg

From what I heard from their staff, this cake was provided by the tremendously famous @fluffbakery well-known for changing its menu regularly (correct me if I\'m wrong!). Tried this a few months back, so it may not be on the shelves anymore.
This place is quite famous for its instagrammable drinks, so we ordered two of their most popular ones (based on other reviews): The Red Velvet Hot Chocolate and the Jaffa Orange Mocha.
Butcher\'s Daughter. Overall is satisfying! And I\'m amazed by the customer service!! Do visit them!

It even comes with dried Jaffa orange peels to increase the citrusy of the drink!
It comes with poached pears that were sliced thinly but was lacking on the taste, and also seasonal fruits such as strawberries!
The pieces of dried chilli flakes were also spicy and intriguing!
Greek and Middle Eastern flourishes pepper the selection of smalls such as hummous and falafel kofta and mains such as Iga Bakar (beef ribs) and Soft Shell Crab Burger.
