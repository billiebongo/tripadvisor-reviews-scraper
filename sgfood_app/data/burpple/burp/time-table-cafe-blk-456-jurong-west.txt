Love it that enough garlic is used to make it so frangrant but not spicy enough for me though i asked for extra spicy. Would very much prefer if chilli padi is used! 🌶🌶🌶🍝 #singapore #igsg #sgig #sgeats #sgfoodies #pasta #spaghetti #ramen #aglioolio #eathealthy #healthylifestyle #brunch #sgcafe #vscocam #vscofood #instafood #instagood #igdaily #photography #photooftheday #travel #travelgram #bbctravel #wanderlust #happyweekend #burpple #foodporn #foodgasm
Pretty decent food options. \n<br />Had the sirloin steak but it was too pepperish for my liking. And they did not ask for done-ness of the beef and it came medium rare which is how I like mine done anyway. \n<br />Overall, 6/10. But I will be back with for more. \n<br />#MrYeong是個吃貨 #foodpic #foodaddiction #foodiesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sirloin #Sunday brunch #instapic #instafood #burpple #burpplesg #timestables
