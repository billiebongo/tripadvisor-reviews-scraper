Was in the area so I went to check out this hawker centre situated in a community club. Everything there looked so good I wasn\'t sure what to get! Couldn\'t resist and overorderedüôÑ
Chendol, which is served with big red beans and drizzled with freshly squeezed coconut milk.¬†
Food wise was ok, only the CKT was impressive. What amazed us was the self-payment kiosks machine at every stall! .\n<br />.\n<br />Ci Yuan (run by Fei Siong) is the only hawker center that has this technology yo~ üëçüèª The machine is so smart that it gives the exact change you need! User friendly as well because I saw elderly using it with ease.‚ò∫Ô∏èüëåüèª Come and try it for yourself as well!üòâ
The noodles soaked in the flavour of the broth, though it is not as wet. The highlight of the noodles, however, is the chilli, which is extra spicy that enhances the flavour of the noodles. Chilli takers may need to be careful with the spiciness here!
At only $2.80. This new prawn mee stall\'s noodles were a steal. The soup/broth was so nice, I finished all of it. Sure to be back for its fresh shrimps and crunchy pork slices! 
The Chicken Kaarage was value for money, given its generous portion of rice and fried chicken. Additionally the chicken tasted fresh and cooked just right. The lontong tasted soothing and the coconut was fragrant but not overpowering, with a balance of spice and sweetness. The satay bee hoon provided more kick, but equally flavorful. The fried egg oyster was small in portion, but freshly fried and tasty. 
I really like the addition of Dou Miao which gives the dish a nice colour and a healthy vibe! (Date: 9 October 2015 Friday)
Ci Yuan Hawker Centre is one of the eating places that I frequent now as the food is good and really affordable.  Plus the place is airy and clean. (Date: 9 October 2015 Friday - Children\'s Day)
I had this yummy and value-for-money meal at the newly opened Ci Yuan Hawker Centre.  I love the use of the automated payment machine to make payment which in my opinion is so much better than the card payment system (I really hate the hassle of having to top up my meal card). The hawker centre is also well-ventilated and it is really comfortable to dine here even though there is no air-conditioning. (Date: 16 September 2015 Wednesday)

Tried this Devil Chicken. Quite big portion which is enough for 2 person share. And best of all the sweet potato fries and the garlic chili sauce. Customer service is good. Give it a try if you there.
I\'ve just wasted 15 mins of breakfast time queueing for this plate of overcooked noodles.
Needed to warm up the tummy with a comforting bowl of Tau Suan (Mung Bean Dessert).\n<br />-\n<br />I was wondering why a lot of elders were patronising the store. Decided to give it a try, and I realised why.\n<br />-\n<br />It was not overly sweet, texture was light and not too grimy or artificial tasting. \n<br />Felt like I could enjoy the simple dessert and not compromise on my health. Even the fried you tiao Ê≤πÊù° didn‚Äôt have that oily after taste. Overall satisfied.\n<br />-\n<br />The store is run by a Mother &amp; Daughter duo. And they keep the prices rather affordable too. ü•ÑTau Suan $1.60 \n<br />Other desserts are priced from $1.60 - $2.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgeats #wheretoeatsg #instafood_sg #foodie #instafood #foodporn #foodgram #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodpics #hungry #onthetable #eeeeeats #f52grams #exploresingapore #eatoutsg #whati8today #igsg #singaporeinsiders #cafesg #instasg #sgmakandiary #rainlingstars #burpple #hawkers #dessert #lunch
You rarely find them in a hawker setting, so, definitely had to try. The cook was Thai too.\n<br />Quite an interesting name of the shop.

Despite it being a small portion, it was surprisingly a good size meal and there was some beef slices &amp; beef ball.\n<br />The pork fish cake was not bad, not too spicy but still had a bit of kick.\n<br />Overall satisfied meal, I would order again.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgeats #wheretoeatsg #instafood_sg #foodie #instafood #foodporn #foodgram #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodpics #hungry #onthetable #eeeeeats #f52grams #foodshare #eatoutsg #whati8today #igsg #singaporeinsiders #hawkers #localfood #instasg #sgmakandiary #sgfoodiary #rainlingstars #burpple #burpplehawkerguide

The prawns were juicy and succulent to have on their own, while the noodles are best tossed in the chopped peanuts and squeezed lime juice.

Fried noodles drenched in flavourful wet prawn broth sauce. The chili may look relatively mild but really packs a spicy kick. #hougang #ciyuancc #ciyuancchawkercentre #hokkienmee #prawn #jiaklocal #burpple
Fried and boiled variants of wantons are given, though they were average at best.

I have been a loyal fan of Yu Kee @yukeeduck for the longest time.¬† Every time when I crave for braised duck, I will head to the nearest Yu Kee outlet and indulge in this appetising set which comprises Braised Duck, Braised Tau Kwa, Salted Vegetables, Bean Sprouts, Braised Peanuts and Braised Egg.¬† I will usually order porridge which goes very well with the special and addictive stew sauce.¬† I also love their flavourful ikan bilis chilli sauce which is the perfect accompaniment to the delectable braised food items.

The gravy also remains just as thick!

The wok hei taste was very light, overwhelmed by its flavourful taste. It was spicy and came in a satisfying serving.
Very juicy and soup was flavourful but the crust was too thick and top of the ÂåÖ was too hard but it was pocket friendly at 6 for $4.80\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #ciyuancc #brunch #dimsum #eatoutsg #exploresingapore #foodporn #foodstagram #foodspotting #foodgasm #foodsg #instadaily #instafood_sg #igers #jiaklocal #nomnnomnom #openricesg #potd #sgfg #sgeats #sgfood #tslmakan #xiaolongbao #vscosg #vscofood #whati8today
