Lobster bisque in pasta form, and comes with one large tiger prawn! [$20.90]
Miam Miam is a casual French-Japanese cafe which offers delectable fusion food at really affordable prices. Each dish is planned and prepared with perfection such as their signature Miam Miam Spaghetti which combines simple ingredients like egg, bacon, mushroom and frankfurters with an exquisite shoyu-broth to give you a taste like no other. (For a full review, check out my blog @ mytravelingtastebuds.blogspot.sg) 
\"Full of fluff\" is a good thing when it comes to pancakes! Houjicha whipped cream, red bean, and mochi balls on Miam miam\'s signature soufflé pancake! It\'s so fluffy I\'m gonna die lol lol 😂😂
Miam Miam is a French-Japanese fusion restaurant that uses sustainable-sourced ingredients. This is their Famous French Toast. The thick and fluffy French toasts are nice but I would have preferred it served with vanilla ice-cream instead of whipped cream. Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg 
Crack through it and you\'ll find an addicting creamy concoction of rice with plenty of mushrooms. What\'s not to love? Ok, that\'s all.
Generously laden with seafood (think: squid and prawn) and lavishly coated with squid ink, each mouthful is a party on your palate – beautiful flavours and textures melding together like the perfect marriage. And the fluffiest of omu egg — creamy, with a slight bite, melts in your mouth — binds it all together like cupid hitting the bull\'s eye. Ok, that\'s all.
Their Miam Miam Spaghetti has a scattering if frankfurter slices, tomatoes, baby spinach, and bacon. The french butter wasn\'t discernible and the shoyu broth\'s flavour was slightly overwhelming that night. Thankfully they topped everything with my fav poached egg that made it so much better. Once again, poached eggs save the day :)
Will still prefer their famous souffle over this. The maccha softserve is not bad thou :)
I don\'t really fancy tomato based pasta but this tomato cream was really good! Mix the garlic mayonnaise into and it\'s so full of flavor yet won\'t get tired of the taste. Spaghetti was al dente and the seafood were shiok! 
One of the recommended dessert from Miam Miam. The souffle is super soft
Softness within melts in your mouth! Though I think its on a pricey side! There will always be space for dessert, right? 😜
Pretty expensive for a small bowl but quality over quantity! Average of 20+ per person depending? Reasonable price range for the variety of food! And most importantly to try their matcha souffles!!
Showering pasta with okonomiyaki and its sauce and toppings resulted in Modern Yaki ($14.80). Really creative take! I got the ice matcha ($6.80) on top of water (chargeable) just in case the dish tasted weird but no! It was really good! Maybe because I like okonomiyaki and the dish tasted like... Okonomiyaki with an extra noodle feeling in your mouth.
Valhorna chocolate. Who could resist? And Miam Miam\'s soufflés are among the better ones in this island.
Second time having this French Toast, a must try dessert after your meal. Combination the traditional and french toast concept.
The breads are tasty and very filling. Price is reasonable too. Totally worth it! ☺️
An all-time favorite in Miam Miam, beautifully done and really fluffy. The french toast itself has a tad of sweetness, combined with maple syrup and whipped cream completes it. Portion is quite huge, do share if you plan to have it after your meal. 
A savory, rich soup base, topped with parmesan cheese and a giant tiger prawn. Soup base was all good, just that I wished ratio of soup base to spaghetti could be more even. Also, at the price of $20.80 it might seem a little steep for just a giant prawn sitting atop. It was yummy nevertheless and would be good with some minor tweaking as mentioned. 
Thick whipped cream with sweet maple syrup and gigantic slices of egg-beaten bread served on an iron pan. C\'est géniale! #miammiamsg #wewantsugar
It may look simple, but just like what my friend (@sophiensyy) said \"It\'s oddly yummy!\"
I loved these two dishes that I\'ve ordered, Miam Miam Spaghetti &amp; Riz Noir Squid Ink Rice, so yummy!

Needing this so much.. 💚🍵 so yummy! \n<br />Matcha pancake with azuki whipped, matcha and coffee jelly, plus kuromitsu (black honey)! This dessert item comes complimentary for every two Executive lunch sets ordered at Miam Miam (Westgate outlet only). 👍One of the best dessert item I have tried at Miam Miam. If you plan to order desserts, must also try their Valrhona chocolate soufflé!
It\'s finally lunch time!! 
This is their story, meanwhile, we are writing our own love story. Happy 49th 💏
Pretty good and the portion is huge. Love the strong shoyu taste! Still isn\'t my favourite item 😉
My 2nd favourite item at Miam Miam tonight 😁\n<br />What is even better than this?! Find out on @sgcafefood tomorrow 😏\n<br />-----\n<br />Hand model courtesy of @joliqin hahaha!
how on earth do these places get away from overcharging. I wouldn\'t pay $20 for some cooked noodles with bacons half a tomato and an egg. period. first time, last time
Thought the white round clump was ice cream but turned out to be just cream. The French toast below was well done though. I like I how thick the toasts are and how it\'s not too buttery or eggy. Recommended for sharing among 3-4 pax.  
Soufflé was really fluffy, bouncy and well balanced atop the tomato rice below. The rice was mixed with some mushrooms and chicken meat. Would have been better if there were vegetables. Good for sharing as one may get sick of it having the whole cheesy eggy business to himself. 
Have had better but still not too bad.
Wasnt overly sweet and cloying. Worth a try!
First time eating Creme Brulee Dessert. Will love it even more if it was hot. The ice-cream taste different from normal ones. It melts immediately in your mouth! Two contradicting tastes, simply one of the best desserts!
Pretty average- The inside of the souffle rather dry but was decent in terms of flavour
Bananas cooked in caramel sauce, served with blueberries and garnished with toasted almond nibs. I preferred this to Hoshino. Anyway, a little bird 🐥 told me that #miammiamsg will be introducing a special cider in December to celebrate the festive season!
Yummy! Creamy ice cream with piping hot french toasts which are neither too oily or bland creates a perfect contrast between hot n cold.

French toast just the way I like it! Apparently the portion can be a little too much for some. Taste great if it\'s sweeter, so do ask for an extra serving of honey too! A little pricey @ SGD15.80!
Squid ink rice with omu egg. Simple ingredients with egg, squids, prawns and a scallop, but the squid ink was heavenly.  Portion not quite big though
Didn\'t like the fact that I had to wait 20 mins just for this after a really long day at work but my soft spot for desserts 🙊 : Original Souffle Pancake ($8.80) #rachfoodadventure #burpple #igsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #miammiam
😁 no really that fantastic. Even thou I am super hungry 😝
Rich and wealth of chocolate! The taste is like 70% of cocoa so you will feel a bit bitter but it is just nice with its heat. Hot and soft. Love it. 
Superb! Real bun, real cream and real honey! Served when it\'s hot. Cream on top and wipe on the bun as much or as little as u like. Same for the honey! Just simply love it!
First time at Westgate, third time at Miam Miam. Still enjoying the dishes and soufflé.
I didn\'t eat the whipped cream, because you know, I gotta eat clean.
Fluffy and soft like pillows.
The pancake is soft, light amd fluffy. The banana is caramelised with sugar which makes it extra sweet. Give it a try if u like pancakes! (:
Modern Yaki, aglio olio sautéed with cabbage, shimeiji mushrooms topped with a runny egg, was surprisingly light yet flavorful. Their soufflé au curry is an interesting take on the traditional baked rice, and while the cheese was fluffed to soufflé perfection, it was abit hard to stomach after awhile. Good for sharing but too much for a single serving. Their French toast topped with cream and maple syrup has got to be the best I\'ve tried, a must eat here! Overall experience was good, generous portions at pocket friendly prices, which explains the snaking queues after 630pm. 
The top layer is crispy yet soft, the filling is complemented with the outer layer so well. If only the portion is bigger 😋
The Miam Miam French Toast did live up to it\'s snobbish description \"don\'t ask, just order it\". Perfectly toasted bread was light and fluffy, without being eggy and wet common with bad French toast, with a dollop of light cream to counter the heaviness of bread. Definitely recommend to try!
Light and fragrant soufflé atop Japanese curry rice, which thankfully wasn\'t heavy nor spicy. I really liked this dish a lot, the creaminess and lightness of the egg went well with the mildly seasoned rice. 
Give this a miss. Rice was hard and felt uncooked. The seafood inside were pretty decent as was the scrambled egg. 
The waiting time for this was sooo long but it was all worth it when you taste the warm fluffy and light texture of the souffle against the icecream
This so called molten lava cake is horrible. Don\'t order this unless u\'re prepared to eat 98% overly moist &amp; be told that \"it\'s meant to be like that\"
Interesting idea of egg and cheese rising to form the fluffy Souffle but tbh, in our opinion too jelat for one person to eat
Got it for free because we spent more than $25 and it\'s the POSB promo! It was really yum, can\'t wait to try the other flavours. Oh but they took more than 30 mins to arrive :/
Really as good as everyone says it is. A must try at least once when you go there! 
Yummmmm esp when you poke the egg and mix the whole thing up. That\'s the way to eat it XD
Surprisingly dope.
Berries cheesecake parfait ($11.80) and a major disappointment it was. Their interpretation of a deconstructed cheesecake was a failure. The ice cream could only be found on the top of the cup. When you get to the middle (and bottom) where all the crumble, strawberry sauce, strawberries and cream cheese blocks are, you are just eating a mixture of all the above without ice cream. Also the cream cheese was placed all together in the centre, making it a coagulated lump of sourness. Never had I thought I would dislike a dessert so much. This is real sad considering how great their pancake and soufflé were from my previous visit.
Creme brûlée ($8.80). Smooth and creamy baked custard with a hard caramelised top. Prepared by an ex student of mine @heartbeatzxc. One thing good about teaching is that you meet students when they go out and work!
Modern yaki ($14.80). Their take on modan yaki, pasta aglio olio sautéed with cabbage, topped with an omelette, Japanese mayonnaise and tonkatsu sauce.
Valrhona chocolate soufflé ($13.80). Heavenly stuff and let\'s not get started on that melted chocolate on top....
Fell in love with this, caramelised bananas pancake. Prepare yourself for this fluffy towering pancake (yes, just one but as talk as a stack). @afen14 you missed this!
My Miam Miam Spaghetti ($15.80). Sautéed with frankfurters, bacon, tomatoes and spinach. Tossed with French butter, secret broth and shoyu. One beautiful plate of spaghetti.
Caught a break and went out for lunch with my good friend @moimou at Miam Miam. Here\'s her Riz Au Curry Rice ($15.80). Ambrosia!
At the highly raved about Miam Miam for dinner tonight! I loved my peanut butter with banana milkshake and thier Riz Au Curry rice! But their pasta and soufflé were okok only! Can\'t appreciate the texture of the soufflé I think it feels like baby\'s vomit! 😂😂😂
Famous French Toast. An Absolute must-have! Don\'t ask, just order - they said.
Brewed the old fashioned way. Hand-dripped from carefully selected 100% Arabica Beans.
Pasta are al dente,will strongly recommend it,squid ink rice is a bit salty though
#burpple
Thought had too soupy, a little too much liquid. Also had onion soup! (See previous post on miam miam too) .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#miammiamsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #japanesefusion #foodiesg #burpple #carbonara #pasta #soup #onionsoup #limejuice

Love the pancake!! 😋😋
not too bad a dish, though was slightly oily and aglio olio styled, but the mentaiko and crab combi was good! Only at Miam Miam!
#howtonotbefat #Burpple
Studs of roasted peanut pieces provide the perfect accent to this beautiful textural study. Ok, that\'s all.
Ok, that\'s all.
First time trying Miam Miam after my colleague had a craving for it during lunch. Somehow it did not catch my attention the many times I was at Westgate. I had the spicy arrabiatta and it came with a free soup during weekday lunchtime. The portion was big; 2 person able to share this. Tastewise, I like the spiciness from the tomato based sauce but they could do with more of the meat for such a big portion. Most of the time I was eating just spaghetti and sauce. Not the best spaghetti bt the huge portion somewhat justifies the price.
Each warm spoonful of smooth custard and bittersweet caramel tastes awesome with their cold vanilla softee. #dessert #cremebrulee #custard #baked #sweet #icecream #miammiam #burpple #instafood
Hardcore day of eating for work.

A hint of salt in the sweetness of burnt caramelized bananas, perfect combination with ice cream and a warm soufflé pancake. #dessert #pancake #sweets #caramel #banana #icecream #caramelized #delicious #weekends #burpple #instafood #miammiam
Slight crispy on the outside &amp; fluffy soft on the inside! Along with the ice-cream &amp; caramelised banana, it is delicious!
First off, the #miammiamfrenchtoast ! Both the toasts and cream are rather dense. Abt drier than what I would prefer.
This plate of spaghetti mix with their running egg yolk can let you drop your saliva. Delicious!!!! 
It is not the only food that is nice. But spending time with colleagues is even nicer! 
Will make a visit again soon. :)
TGIF with my dearly colleagues! Enjoy every moment. 
Sweetness in control as maple syrup is served separately. Fluffy and buttery, this makes one happy dessert for sharing! #frenchtoast #dessert #miammiam #cafe #burpple

Was a main course for me and turned out absolutely delicious! Went there at dinner time with w group of 16+ people and food was served pretty fast :) Definitely recommend this dish, rice &amp; cheese with a bit of meat on the inside. 
But this is just irresistable! Along with the fluffy pancake and soft serve, this fantastic combination looks gorgeous as well!
Oooohhhh slurpppss! Loving the runny egg! A little salty though.
miam miam and miam again, until you become soufflés.

Soufflé x soufflé pancake 
The egg added flavour to the spaghetti. Yummy!
Hungry desu yo
Worth the cost and love it very much! 
Wise choice to share this dessert. 
Caramelized banana was way too sweet for me.
Just my type of soufflé~ 
Tsk~ 😃
Good food good company &amp; great comfort food

It came with a sofee ... Pudding like 
Eaten together with the soufflé on top is just the perfect combi! Step aside Riz Au Curry, your counterpart with the soufflé is my current fav at the moment! 😍
We only had space for French Toast but it was quite nice. The Soufflé au Curry is just weird..... 🍞🍛 #MiamMiam #FrenchToast #FrenchJapaneseCuisine #SouffléAuCurry #dinner #latergram
