Their famous butter pork ribs along with XO fish sliced hor fun and garlic stir fry kai lan. Damage-$23
Pork ribs is tender and cooked in Thai style that\'s not too sour, sweet or spicy. The onion at the side complements it. 
For me who doesn\'t like pork floss, this dish is considered very nice because the prawn is huge and tasty that you can\'t really taste the pork floss. 
A definite must order every time I dine here !
Now you know where you can go when the food cravings strike. #tingzieeats #burpple #tingzietimewithfolks and with a special guest from London!
Their must-order dishes included the milk-powder pork ribs (more addictive than cereal coating), 3-egg spinach (finally one that\'s really eggy), pork floss prawns (traditionally battered fried prawns) and fresh cockles (yes fresh and good). For those of you who are into Assam curry, their Assam sotong is a good alternative for a small portion of tasty sour and spicy Assam to go with the rice. \n<br />Also liked that their services were friendly and they always try to serve dishes to the table all at a go so we could enjoy the meal in whole. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #burpproved #tzechar
Just fresh cockles marinated in sauce with spring onions, garlic and chilli, it was simple and good. The light refreshing sauce complemented well to bring out the sweetness from the fresh cockles. It was a perfect starter to a delicious and economical meal at Two Chefs.\n<br />Other recommended dishes include their buttermilk pork ribs, trio egg spinach, pork floss prawns and tofu with minced pork and mushrooms. #burpple burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #burpproved #cockles
