Wasn\'t expecting a creamy mushroom based pasta for this. What made it even more intriguing was the addition of bonito flakes and seaweed. Wasn\'t too bad, but nothing impressive either. The angel hair pasta was al dente. Prawns were a bit overcooked for my liking. Priced at $20++.
Reminded of Pacman? This burger made me go OMG as I feasted on it. At $21, this was reasonably priced. The burger was packed with a juicy beef patty, luncheon meat, crispy bacon, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, onions and topped beautifully with a sunny side-up egg. The generous portions of crispy straight-cut fries was also very shiok. This burger is my reason for my revisits here! Rating: 5 / 5
Wanted something light and got recommended this starter. Loved the balance of flavours and great presentation! All for the price of $12 üëçüèªüëçüèª not forgetting they do great coffees too 
Quite a big cup of coffee. Good value for money. Nice as well
This has got to be the cafe where I have one of the most enjoyable experience! For the start, service was excellent. All service staff serve with a smile, and we were served water almost immediately as we sat down and pondered over the menu. Coffee and food was served faster than the time taken for me to decide what to eat. While the gigantic mocha was too large for my liking, it was actually not too bad - creamy and chocolatey yet you could detect coffee. We ordered Eggs Benedict and Eggs Royal - these are the best I have ever had (after EM which I haven\'t been to for quite some time). Eggs were perfectly done and oozed over the generous layers of ham, or salmon, and as we took a bite, we could also taste the crispness of the bread that was slightly burnt. Delicious! And I would definitely be back!

Prawn capellini; creamy with nuances of chilli and crunchy, tasty prawns. They need to do something about the air conditioning though.
The burger is delicious. Who knows green apple goes well with this burger. Try it and you will know. The upgrade of $2 is so worth it, so much fries that I can\'t finish!
Tender and moist, I almost mistook these for chicken. Not sure if they were intentionally made to be quite bland (that\'s what the dipping sauce is for right?), but I really wished they were flavoursome enough to be eaten on their own!
Was expecting a aglio olio kind of flavor but the pasta turned out to be more sweet than savoury. Didn\'t like it at all!
I had this sometime ago and I must say their serving of egg benedict is pretty impressive. The coffee is certainly good here! Give it a try along this quiet stretch of Rangoon Road! 
We learnt that each cupping session involves careful scoring from roasting of the beans, to breaking of the crust to loudly slurping the coffee to taste and, also factoring in the consideration of local tastebuds that the coffee is not \"too green\" for liking. C loves the roasted Yirgacheffe (which in my opinion is the most acidy) from the three different beans while I... like my kopi C beng üòÇ Jewel wants to keep its element of surprise, making the place \"new\" with changing roast so don\'t order the same thing every time you are there and you will make the boss happy by being adventurous!
cool vibes here, one of the many cafes along rangoon but this is one of the better ones! food is slightly pricier though
The option to change the fries is the best option EVER. \n<br />Thick cut fries infused with truffle oil and this succulent chicken, üòç! I AM HAPPY BEING OVERWEIGHT.
I\'ve no idea what is in half of this burger but it just tasted like what I imagine a perfect burger would be; soft brioche buns, juicy beef patty and that distinct taste of cheese. I topped up $2 for Crispy fries (fries with Parmesan) too!
You managed to finish all the food! People usually can\'t finish everything.\" Obviously, she doesn\'t know my IG nick. And obviously, I lied about my diet again. \n<br />Great ambience, great service, great servings and even greater savings with my entertainer app! üòõüòõüòõüòõ
Have been craving for pancakes and read good reviews about the ricotta pancake here. Was slightly disappointed that the pancakes were a little monotonous, they were fluffy and soft but missing the outer crisp. The zesty lemon mascarpone was surprisingly good together with the strawberries and caramelized bananas. Nevertheless, they were pretty decent overall. 
This may just be one of the best eggs benedict in my books! The eggs were poached just right with a runny yolk and without the sour aftertaste that you may get with some poached eggs cooked with vinegar. The homemade hollandaise sauce is extremely yummy, paired with back bacon and crispy english muffin, each bite is just as satisfying as the last. Just perfect for a lazy Sunday brunch. 
The truffle mushroom soup was light in texture but intense in flavor. The soup had chunky bits of mushroom, the way I like it. And the hint of truffle oil gave a good touch to the overall light soup. 
Pre-dinner snack with yummy deep fried pork cubes. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Picture might not do justice but I really love this sinfully good dish. 
With so many cafes sprouting in Rangoon road, the Jewel cafe is one where I kept returning for their great vibes and food &amp; coffee...
At $23++, I thought it would be better. However, the risotto rice wasn\'t as soft as I liked, the rice was pretty hard for a risotto (maybe because I like it much like porridge kind), plenty of mushrooms. But was pretty jelat even before half of the plate was eaten. Foie gras wasn\'t good as well. Sigh.
This however was an exquisite experience, my friend. The buns with medium grilled beef patty, cheese, BACON JAM, and weirdly granny Smith apple slices was a pretty interestingly good combination. Topped up $2 for truffle fries and we are good to roll!
What surprised me was the serving of the latte at jewel, for $5.50++ I was given my large cup of caffeine. Smooth Blend today too of Finca San Carlos - milk chocolate, caramel sweetness citrus. They seemed to be during free public cupping this morning too!
Cafe was empty. Only me and my fren and 1 customer in the cafe. Quiet place to study and chill with frens. Have WiFi! Need to ask for the password I guess. Friendly staffs. Food was sadly jus average. 3/5.
Nothing special, but would like to return and try the brunch menu
I was busy wiping off the drool from my mouth, hence the rest was history.
Spotted another new cafe about to open while on the way to Jewel Cafe.
 Cesar salad with poached egg with my usual latte. I really like the sauce for the salad especially with candied bacon sprinkled in it. However, the poached egg wasn\'t drained properly sadly.  
Romaine lettuce tossed with caesar salad dressing, topped with crispy bacon, shaved parmesan and poached egg. Disappointed that my poached egg is overdone and not runny. The \"croutons\" are actually French loaf and kinda hard. Love the bacon &amp; shaved Parmesan thou\'. 
Hopped over for something savoury, pardon my bad memory,#whatsthename intriguing butter based pasta, wanton mee like noodles,ebiko and umami!
Fresh clams saut√©ed in white wine, garlic, parsley &amp; lemon. A little on the salty side, but nothing beats a plate of clams! Definitely a good dish to go for if you\'re just peckish.
This was a HEFTY portion of sin, if not for which we would have wiped clean. 
Not bad for a place that is so ulu haha üòõ#coffee #sisterbonding #burpletopcafeinsingapore
Flat white was just alright, but I expected more for the price. Lacks the flavor of the beans. 
OMG is at $22! stacked sinfully with 2 slices of a tad too dry bacons, luncheon meat and finished with a sunny side up. yes, you read me correctly, a slice of luncheon meat in the burger. prolly the only salty thing i remember bout this expensive burger though. nuff said. am i so wrong bout jewel cafe? ok there was a redeeming factor. at least the truffle fries were decent that day.
Very crunchy crumble with vanilla ice to soften the crunch. Very nice. 
Haven\'t mastered the art of drinking coffee without messing up the latte art. 
A heavenly burger ($20++) that pits sweet bacon jam against tart slices of Granny Smith apple, with a juicy, American cheese-topped beef patty and rocket leaves thrown in the mix. Jostling as well for the attention of your tastebuds are fries and a mixed salad. Now, my advice is to immediately upgrade those ordinary fries to truffle fries for just $2 more. You\'ll thank me - they\'re so totally worth it.
Blame it on the luncheon meat. Once I read in the menu that it makes an appearance in the burger, I was sold. In spite of the juicy, thick beef patty (good but not fantastic), crispy bacon (sorry my darling!) and sunny-side up egg, the luncheon meat stole my heart. Dressed with lettuce, sliced purple onion, tomatoes and mayo, this is a burger that will leave you more than sated. Price: $22++\n
Good fragrant coffee. In a very large cup. Yay!
 The cafe uses only single origin coffee beans from Brazil, Ethiopia and Sumatra, and they roast their beans here. Here\'s Heather‚Äôs Meatball Sandwich with chunky home made meatballs on baguette. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/jewel-cafe-bar-at-rangoon-road/
Next few are good pancake experiences that need to be shared too: @ $14 another good option! Not very dense pancakes that are well complimented w a¬†dollop of lemon zest cr√®me fra√Æche &amp; blueberry compote
This second outlet of Jewel Coffee is a spacious, chilled out cafe set in Little India. Just right for relaxing on a weekday, you might have the whole space to yourself to enjoy a beautifully brewed cup of artisanal coffee. If you\'re hungry, go for their ricotta pancakes or their highly recommended chili crab pasta.\n
The taste is just nice not too sweet but abit soak 
Batter wasnt tt great and it was pretty oily. 
One of the best burgers around. All packed and towered with oh so juicy ingredients; you don\'t wanna miss this when you take a trip down. Cod fish was amazing. Thumbs up for this very hearty meal.
It\'s busy but worth it...... Try the Ricotta and Banana Pancakes
OMG Burger it\'s really OMFG! ‚ù§üçî #simplylovesspam
OMG burger with 2 slices of crispy bacon, luncheon meat, cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato, and topped with a sunny side up! üçî
Smoked salmon salad with capers, onions, radish, and orange vingarette.
More carbo loading! Love truffle fries! 
Soft and lively acidity, with a zesty floral note in aroma and cup. 
The OMG burger is a must try. Beef patty with Bacon, luncheon meat, sunny side up and onions and tomatoes and lettuce. Breakfast is served till 3pm on weekends.
Umami Prawn Capellini was drenched in sweet prawn-bonito-roe infused sauce &amp; topped with fresh grilled prawns. Boiled diced octopus in Japanese salted rice malt tasted so refreshing with creamy avocado &amp; a subtle hint of wasabi in extra virgin olive oil. Egg Royale was the best I had come across as the warm fluffiest muffin came soaked in rich runny yolk &amp; sweet smoky salmon. Brunch was other-worldly! An apt name &amp; a gem beside the much-raved -about Liberty Coffee üòä
What\'s there not to love this burger? Thick juicy patty, crispy bacon PLUS crispier luncheon meat! This is really OMG! It very well cooked and a joy to devour. I should have labelled it \"Sinful but great\" or \"Must Try\" but really it\'s a real delight for meat lovers. 
Pasta cooked Hokkien mee style
OMG Burger at Jewel Cafe. It\'s really called OMG with luncheon meat inside! Review at DanielFoodDiary.com
The OMG! Burger, loaded with a beef patty, luncheon meat, crispy bacon, cheddar, lettuce, onion and tomato. Usually topped with a sunny-side-up, but mine came on the side. OMG indeed. #omg #burger #sinful #meaty #motherofburgers #foodporn
New coffee place! A little too much milk in my flat white though #coffee #applecrumnble #desserts
Stock made from prawn heads cooked in butter, bonito flakes that look like bacon rashers curling, unfurling
The egg is usually inside the burger! Slices of bacon, luncheon meat inside.
Japanese octopus tossed with shio-koji, wasabi, extra virgin oil, avocado and ginger flower
Meet the Mother of Burgers. This mammoth is packed with a juicy beef patty, crispy bacon, a sunny-side-up, cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato and get this - LUNCHEON MEAT. It\'s a heart attack waiting to happen, but OMG, I\'ll risk it. 
Succulent slab of Iberico pork baked in the oven with a miso marinade and served with mash. Didn\'t get a pic, but the pork was beautiful and pink in the middle, just the way a gorgeous cut of Iberico should be.
Sliced baguette to go with a sweet-and-smoky bacon jam. Yes, BACON JAM. Think ba kwa in a spread. Sounds strange, but the taste grows on you.
Don\'t forget to have your fruits after a heavy meal. This unique dessert features juicy blocks of watermelon topped with piquant balsamic glaze and a scoop of zesty pineapple sorbet. 
This pasta dish is cooked with homemade prawn oil, covered to allow the noodles to absorb all the prawny flavour, and then infused with a secret umami \"magic dust\". Sounds interesting, yes? Unfortunately, I found this far too sweet and it made me sick after three mouthfuls. Minus points for the soggy pasta, too. 
Not remarkably outstanding, but the beef patty was perfectly juicy, and I liked the hit of blue cheese and onions caramelised in port wine reduction. 
Diced, pan-seared octopus tossed with shio-koji, a fermented rice and salt seasoning, served on avocado and laced with wasabi. It\'s a myriad of textures and flavours that turned out to be surprisingly light and refreshing. 
Croutons soak in a steamy bath of fragrant onion soup, under the cover of melted Swiss cheese, parmesan and gruyere. A classic well done.

Unfortunately there was an issue with using the entertainer (that they didn\'t bring to my attention earlier despite me indicating I would be using the app) arising from interpretation of the TnCs and I had to reason a bit with the waitstaff who luckily were understanding.

This citrusy dish is fantastic if you are looking for a refreshing treat, especially in our tropical climate.
The thin slices of aged parmesan cheese though is what truly make this dish of pasta tick.

Fat Solider is a creative dish of baguettes served with warm bacon jam which tastes like honey bak gua sauce. And my third cup of coffee has a very distinct flavour, different from the tradition cafe latte. This San Francisco is produced using a cold brew technique which uses cold water to steep through coffee beans for hours which will then produce a more concentrated smoother coffee. This has the right mix of sourness and bitterness, tho a tad bitter for me. #coffee #cafe #bacon #jam #baguette #danieleats #foodporn
