Essentially a matcha hotcake with molten matcha lava that was suppose to flow out, but in our case, didn\'t flow out as dramatically as we hope it\'d be. Nevertheless, this dessert is pretty well executed. Crispy along its edges, there were biscuit crumble, azuki, yuzu peels and the best part, mochi to accompany it. This dish is just shouting Japanese in your face. I like how the yuzu brought a tinge of zing to the dish. Now I\'m wondering if adding a scoop of ice cream will further enhance this otherwise already perfect dish 🤔
Tryna act healthy by eating healthy food but failed when I ordered the one with sio bak 👏🏼
Dont cha wan some mushi-3 layers kind of food, porridge-esque rice, chawanmushi, some sort of broth top with (i choose) scallops. Rice and chawanmushi probably too bland as soon as i finished the broth. Nice scallops, not chewy at all (indicating that it\'s frwsh i think, not a seafood expert here) 3.25/5
Kaya Toast-thick toasts with crumbs and ice cream, thought that with the other components, the kayas taste is masked 3.5/5
Pass - meat not over cooked and flavorful. Gives a feeling of a simple healthy meal.
Juicy beef with grilled corn furikake, sautéed mushrooms, onsen egg, glazed carrots and garlic chips! Perfect Combi I must say. We also tried the Waikiki Surf ($16) which was rather new on the menu: Yuzu marinated salmon poke, smashed avocado, sakura ebi and onsen egg. A decent refreshing dish. But I’ll still stick with my favorite Apoke theory for my poke fix. ❤️
essentially a giant matcha lava cake that\'s nicely executed! cutting into the crisp edge reveals the molten matcha lava hidden inside which just fills you with such warmth. 
honestly their grain bowls pale in comparison to this. the creamy sauce with a hint of mentaiko really ties in well with the fresh seafood! the scallops, prawns and mussels were all done perfectly and the crisp toast that came along with it was a great idea. there\'s only just enough sauce for the seafood and toast so i ended up scraping the bowl for every single drop that\'s left!!!
Ninja Cut\'s tastes wasn\'t always spot on. I don\'t really fancy the onions in this dish and I think a little tartness could be added to the crab/maybe sour cream on the side to enhance flavor of the whole dish. The Marvellous Matcha overall was also sweet in a single dimension. But Ninja Cut is doing a great job with textures. I appreciate that the rosti and Marvellous Matcha were done crispy around the edges and fluffy inside which is worth commending. 
Will recommend this place for their marvellous matcha. The kaya toast got a little je-lat after a while. \n<br />Main dishes and drinks were average.
Was told that this along with the rosti was sold out at 3pm the other day so we waited 30 minutes for them to get ready again. Pretty decent because we were legit starving but is it just me or are you guys upset with me that only mine doesn\'t have enough edible flowers 😭
Mentaiko cheese baked saba fish, on a bed of quinoa (add $3) and assorted veggies. Loved the cabbage slaw so much I wish the carrots were pickled too.
Check out @theninjacut\'s brand new additions to their menu on the blog NOW, like this Kaya French toast!
Pretty comforting dish in this Beefy Patty Macaroni, but lacks a punch for myself. Great for this cuddle weather. 🤤
We tried some of the new dishes on their menu. 😋 .\n<br />1️⃣Beefy Patty Macaroni reminded me of a hearty bowl of macaroni soup, except it\'s better!😋 That homemade beef hamburg with cheese as well as their perfectly poached egg. 😌👌🏻 .\n<br />2️⃣don\'t-Cha-Wan-some-Mushi. I have to give it to the name. 😂👍🏻👍🏻 Think a combination of Japanese chawanmushi, cheese rice and Hokkaido scallops!🤤🤤 .\n<br />3️⃣Hello Ebi-Bardy. This name too. 😂😂 This is something I could eat everyday!😋
Can’t say you have been to The Ninja Cut without having their Marvellous Matcha ($18 *price has went up), especially if you are a matcha fan. Not just any matcha ‘hotcake’, the complex lava-filled dessert was complemented with chewy-soft homemade dango, a quenelle of ricotta cheese, decorative edible flowers, crunchy crumble, dollops of azuki beans and yuzu peel which lends a refreshing zing to the sweet sweet treat. Baked to order, the best parts would have to be the crispy edge and closely followed by the oozing warm molten centre. And though the flowing green tea fondant was not overly cloying, it lacked the strong bitter-sweetness and fragrance matcha usually carry. A well-executed ‘hotcake’nonetheless, it is best to share with 2 or more!
Imagine that fluffy brioche toast stuffed with HOMEMADE Kaya and Mochi Cheese, and then served with gula meleka crumbles and a salted mascarpone ice cream. 🤤if this doesn\'t make you salivate, I don\'t know what does.

My first time trying out Ninja Cut\'s grain bowls and my favourite has to be The Hot Cheek because of that sweet-savoury beef cheek that has been braised for 24 hours, according to the menu. The squid however I find wasn\'t cleaned thoroughly enough (resulting in that slimy center) but the grill and the flavour on that was spot-on. I would definitely need to add the Ninja rice/soba for an additional $2, to soak up all the flavour of the sauces and of course, the runny onsen egg. It was a Saturday and we arrived at 12pm so thankfully we missed the lunch crowd at around 1pm!
My mantaiko seafood with soba was so gooooddd! Come with price tag of ($20). Their side dishes also start from $12 onwards. GST inclusive and No service charge.. No more tgif for me tho, gotta sleep early tml got work. #mentaiko #soba #foodsg #burpple #igsg
Pricey side dishes combined in a bowl. The soba noodles are exquisite though. But the vegetables are pretty raw? Maybe it\'s the taste they going for;) 
The dish was pretty single dimensional. Most components- the matcha lava, azuki paste, candied zest and crumble were all sweet which made the whole dish jelak. Wished there were salty (sea salt in place of icing sugar) or bitter (in the lava) elements to create more contrasting flavors. Despite the flaws, I enjoyed the crispy edge of the fluffy pancake the most.
Most healthy grain bowls are only available during lunch and are situated within the CBD, but this snazzy, hip space conveniently located in town serves its protein-rich grain bowls all day long — great for meeting up with that #eatclean friend of yours. Like its sister outlet Ninja Bowl in Duxton, you can choose to have soba, greens or Ninja Rice as your base ($2 each) — we recommend the latter that mixes brown and Japanese rice for a heartier meal. Every ingredient in their grain bowls, regardless of protein, is well-executed — the honey glazed carrots are soft and sweet, the moreish miso cucumbers add a nice crunch and the onsen eggs are wobbly, every single time. Go for the crowd favourite Squid Fix ($18) and What\'s Your Beef? ($18). The former features an entire Japanese squid, perfectly grilled on both sides and tender to the bite, while the latter comes with 150g of Australian rib-eye, roasted with a pink ring in the centre. Only 30 portions of the beef are available daily, so head down early! Wash it all down with a cup of Coffee (from $4.50) — they use a house blend of Colombian, Guatemalan and Ethiopian beans.\n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Mag Chow
This was my second visit to Ninja Cut. Wanted to get the Char Siew Peekaboo initially but I was told that it wasn\'t available because there\'s no Char Siew, so I ordered the Polenta Mash but again it wasn\'t available since the meat used was also char siew. The staff offered to change the meat to pork belly, hence I requested for the Char Siew Peekaboo\'s meat to be changed to pork belly. To my dismay, the staff said no?? Like huh, why not when it can be done for the other Char Siew dish?? Reluctantly she did it for me eventually. Anyway, the pork belly was pretty good, not too fatty and oily. Ate it together with the pickled lotus root as the lotus roots were too sour and a lil spicy. The Sakura ebi, however, added a special twist to the dish as a whole.
.. and truffle fries  ($12+)\n<br />I feel the ingredients were too little for the price.\n<br />For Oh My Cod, there\'s no grains and to add on a small amount of quinoa, it\'s additional $3+.\n<br />The piece of cod was small and the dish is not filling at all. Taste was normal .\n<br />However, love the truffles fries and industrial setting 👍🏻
🥞\n<br />•\n<br />I absolutely adore Matcha &amp; I love sweet endings. Topped with Ricotta Cheese to balance the sweetness, Yuzu peel for that added tanginess, crumbed for the crunchy dimension, dango &amp; azuki beans which god knows why (it\'s already damn sweet &amp; green tea fondant (white chocolate &amp; matcha powder) oozing out of the Matcha Lava cake, it\'s hard to resist. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Its like matching a girl from tinder, she looks nice, oozing with sexiness &amp; confidence. But she\'s too sweet &amp; for a while you get tired of it because she\'s playing it way too safe &amp; you\'re looking for that feistiness in her but it never shows. 🖖🏻 *needs more Matcha (pun intended)
Great place for catch up, unwinding, reflection etc etc etc! Enjoyed both their cappuccino($5) and pancake($16 I think?)👍🏼✌🏻
Limited portions Daily (💵S$18) : Roast Beef Ribeye, Grilled Corn, Furikake, Sautéed Mushrooms, Onsen Egg, Honey-Glazed Carrots &amp; Garlic Chips. 🐮\n<br />•\n<br />Limited to 30 plays, Beef is cooked medium like how it should be done. Sautéed mushrooms &amp; Onsen Egg are the side casts that stand out. The rest played their part well but it\'s the threesome of the classic combination that is Beef, Onsen Egg &amp; Sautéed Mushrooms that made the session kinda pleasurably  memorable. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Ninja Cuts are a healthier version of Ninja Bowl, it\'s part of Darren Wee\'s The Astronauts Group. \n<br />Another Beef dish will be from the Brunch section - Ninja\'s Steaks &amp; Eggs (💵S$20) which is also limited portions. 🖖🏻
🎏\n<br />•\n<br />It\'s, let\'s face it, riding the poke bowl hype nowadays. With many many poke bowls around, Ninja Cut\'s version has nothing to shout about. 🏵\n<br />It\'s decent, the salmon poke is fresh &amp; seasoned nicely with Yuzu. Wish there could be more Sakura Ebi though. 🥑\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: You have the choice to add an extra base such as ; (💵S$3) for Quinoa, (💵S$2) for Ninja Rice, Soba &amp; Garden Greens for a complete meal. 🥗\n<br />Plus prices are Nett, No Service Charge, No GST. 🖖🏻
The matcha hotcakes is the bomb: sweet matcha fluid flowing out of a nice squishy malay-kueh-like cake. Super amazing. $16 and more than enough for 2. Skip the mains at this place, they\'re pretty normal and we think Grain Traders or Daily Cut is better.
The seafood soaked in cream mentaiko sauce was delicious and we enjoyed it very much.
24-hour braised Japanese curry beef cheek, garden greens, grilled cheese sandwich
This warm matcha lava hotcakes was soft and moist. The matcha taste wasn\'t as strong as I wanted it to be. The lemon zest added a citrusy flavor. \n<br />Cost: $16
This Japanese curry beef cheek with vegetables and quinoa is a great make-you-feel-good bowl. It was surprisingly delicious as well. $20-25 per pax.
Was a rather disappointed that there wasn\'t lava \"flowing\" out from the hotcakes but it was still good! It was sooo filling even sharing between 2 of us, we were not able to finish it.
Healthy servings of ribeye. Enjoyed how the honey glazed carrots went with the sautéed mushrooms and onsen egg. Please add the ninja rice for a fulfilling meal.
Definitely liked the more generous meat portions here. Oh My Cod! ($18 + $2 soba) featured a fragrantly baked miso cod, with a plethora of colourful accompaniments. We also had The Hot Cheek ($14) which was tender 24-hour braised Japanese curry beef cheek with roasted cauliflower and sweet cherry tomatoes. #burpple #BurppleXChope #xuannyeatsclean
The matcha was rich and tasted great with yuzu, mochi bits and digestive biscuits 😋
$18 + $3 for a generous portion of quinoa. There was a lot of squid too which was quite filling. It was cooked well and not overly chewy. The carrots were👌🏼
This dish is my favourite. The big piece of cod was nice and buttery with the miso sauce. The Onsen egg was cooked nicely, a bit more runny than your typical soft boiled egg. The carrots, beets,asparagus and edamame all go together with the dish well. Though I wish they would be a bit more generous with the edamame. I have tried this with quinoa and soba, both of which are great but for this dish I prefer soba 🍜
I can understand why people flock here for a good meal. Hearty, good portion bowl, that\'s so colourful and utterly delicious. The beef, is a tad tough, but the brown sauce is earthly. But the clear winner is that perfectly runny, wobbly egg in the center that makes everything so cohesive. Not to mention the ultimate #eggporn. If you need carbo in your system, just add another $2 for rice or soba, and done, you\'re good to go.
A short walk from City Hall MRT station, this cafe facing Raffles Hotel dishes out hearty, protein-based grain bowls at reasonable prices (prices are nett). Like its sister outlet in Duxton, Ninja Bowl, you can choose to have soba, greens or Ninja Rice as your base ($2 each), of which we recommend the latter that mixes brown and Japanese rice. The What\'s Your Beef ($18) bowl features 150g of Australian ribeye, cooked to a medium-rare doneness. It is loaded with grilled corn, sautéed mushrooms, honey glazed carrots and golden garlic chips, all perfectly plated to surround a wobbly onsen egg. There are only 30 plates of What\'s Your Beef available daily, so head down early to snag one! For non-beef lovers, either the Oh My Cod! ($18) that comes with a perfectly pan-seared miso-sake marinated cod fillet, or the lightly grilled Squid Fix ($18) will satisfy. Oh, and since you (kinda) ate clean, you might as well share a Marvellous Matcha ($16) — the irresistible oozing matcha hotcake!\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Shawn Loh
First of, I really loved the atmosphere of the place, it was beautiful and a very good place to chill at. Food was great as well, I had the tuna and my friend had the salmon. Not usually a fan of cucumber but the miso cucumber had me scarfing down every mouthful. Best part is the prices are NETT! Will definitely be back to try the squid and also the matcha :)
My friend was the one who had it but I tried the tuna and it tasted real good. Apparently she quite enjoyed her ninja bowl. So it must say something.
Japanese Curry Beef Cheek bowl with an assortment of ingredients. Opted for no base because my friend and I both decided that we\'d try their sweet potato fries. The portion of the food was quite big on its own! And the sweet potato fries were enough to fill us up. The beef cheek came with a delectable aroma of curry in the air. It was flavorful with a light curry taste that wasn\'t too sweet that Japanese curry can prove to be sometimes. Break the onsen egg and mix with beef if you want to!
Don\'t miss out the \"What\'s Your Beef\" ($18) which is served with a 150g of medium rare Australian Ribeye accompanied with grilled corn seasoned with furikake, sautéed mushrooms, honey glazed carrots, a wobbly onsen egg, and golden garlic chips.\n<br />.\n<br />Another recommended dish is their \"Squid Fix\" ($18) which features a whole Japanese Squid served with sautéed mushrooms, miso cucumbers, honey glazed carrots and furikake.\n<br />.\n<br />You should not miss this \"The Cheeky Cheese\" ($18) 24 hours braised beer cheek paired with an oozy grilled cheese brioche sandwich.\n<br />.\n<br />Location: @theninjacut 32 Seah Street, Singapore 188388\n<br />.\n<br />#theninjacut #burpple #burpplesg
(roast beef ribeye, grilled corn furikake, sautéed mushrooms, onsen egg, honey-glazed carrots, garlic chips) from Ninja Cut along Seah Street.
Omg which genius came up with the idea of stuffing matcha lava into a pancake please own up #BurppleXChope
My jaw got really tired. Lucky we share between the 2 of us. Marvellous match ($16) was nice! Its like matcha lava cake top with candied yuzu peel and sweeten red bean. The crunch at the side gives the whole dessert an extra texture. Will i go again? Maybe, but i wont give the squid a 2nd chance.
It comes with a whole grilled Japanese squid, served alongside sautéed mushrooms, miso cucumbers and honey-glazed carrots. The squid appears to be soft and chewable unlike those rubbery ones.
This dish satisfied my cravings for a hearty yet healthy brunch with a lovely combination of nutritious ingredients in a pokebowl. Fresh sautéed mushrooms, grilled corn, honey-glazed mushroom, a perfectly cooked onsen egg and a generous portion of tender beef cooked to medium rare topped off with a tasty special sauce. #BurppleXChope
I opted for soba as my base, bad mistake. The soba at this joint looked and tasted like instant noodles. The onsen egg didn\'t improve the dish, seemingly just hype to me.
Beef was absolutely lovely and everything in the plate complemented one another well. The salmon poke was a bit lacking though!
😍😍Of course, onsen egg makes everything better. 😌👌🏻😋 Oh yes, Ninja Cut is finally open for dinner!💃🏻
👑 Had pretty high expectations of @theninjacut\'s Cheeky Cheese ($18) based on what I saw here, but was a tad disappointed. The sandwich was slightly moist and sufficiently cheesy and the curry beef cheek tender and fragrant, but ooze and amaze they did not. Or am I just asking for too much? 😶 Verdict: Not bad as a  #lunch option but not something I would go out of my way for! #brunch #food #sgfood #theninjacut #burpple
It is roast to a medium-rare doneness and marinated with simple aromatics, alongside with grilled corn, sautéed mushrooms, honey-glazed carrots, onsen egg and golden garlic chips. Gonna admit there\'s something comforting about this bowl right here. 🤔 #TheNinjaCut
-\n<br />#TheNinjaCut\'s take on Southern-Creole style pork and grits. A hearty plate of homemade aburi chashu roulade on a bed of warm truffle polenta mash, topped with Parmesan cheese shavings. Served with sautéed mushrooms at the side. Love the creamy polenta mash!
, sautéed mushrooms, onsen egg, grilled corn furikake, honey glazed carrots and garlic chips. Definitely a bowl I wouldn\'t mind having day and night 👍🏻 ($18- limited portions a day)
It bleeds molten matcha lava. Sprinkles on top and at the side include speculoos crumble, red bean , homemade dango and ricotta cheese.
The cheese wasn\'t overpowering and it balance real well with curry beef cheek👍😍💕 Coconut Lemon Mint was sweet, refreshing with lots of coconut flesh in it! \n<br />Shall go back for more!💕 #burpple
Went to try ninja cut just the other day bc I have been wanting to try it for the longest time after trying ninja bowl. TBH quite disappointed by the blandness of the bowl that I ordered - ready steady veggie :-( it looked so pretty and the egg was poached well, beers were picked well, corn was roasted well but the quinoa and mushrooms were rather bland. The egg, despite the runny yolk, did not give the dish a creamy rich quality. In fact, I did not feel that the dish went well together, it came more so as individual components on the plate. That being said, my friend said that the dish that she ordered - miso cod was tasty and flavorful. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish so I will be back to give this place another shot :-) 
The oomph moment when the hot and fluffy hotcake is filled with matcha goodness 😌\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Slightly more grainy in texture, the warm polenta mash has truffle infused so it\'s bursting with alluring aroma. Accompanied with sautéed mushroom, parmesan cheese shavings and two thick slices of aburi pork, it is a great way to start the day.
.
This is #TheNinjaCut\'s \'Oh My Cod!\' ($18, supplement $2 for soba) of white miso cod fillet, honey-glazed carrots, asparagus, edamame, pickled beetroot, and - of course - that egg.
The pan-seared upon order cod fish embraced a sweet note. The buttery yet firm texture will leave you wanting more, and we had this with buckwheat Soba noodles at a top up of $2!\n<br />Thank you @sixthsensepr and @theninjacut for the invitation!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
5 times bigger than a normal lava cake and I expected it to be 5 times more shiok. However the red bean and rice cakes were definitely just Instagram amounts, rather than eatable amounts 😜. Sadly that they took some time to serve it and it didn\'t flow the way I wanted. 🤷🏻‍♀️ #burpplebestbugis
The squid was grilled to perfection, with it being slightly chewy. The mixed brown rice was also nice to munch on. Though every side taste good on its own, it didn\'t quite go well together.  #burpplebestbugis
Nothing fancy with the plating but it was pretty good!Served with a gloriously golden-brown grilled cheese sandwich that isn\'t too heavy nor jelak, 24h braised Japanese curry beef cheek that was absolutely tender and tasty. 
.
Stated as matcha \"hotcake\", it was more of a blown up lava cake as \"unexpected\" matcha flows when cut. Oozing matcha goodness match with chewy homemade dango, candied yuzu peel, ricotta cheese, speculoos crumbles and azuki bean, this dish is truly a delight. Felt it\'s too huge and sweet for me to finish alone, so best to share the calories with friends.
Favourite bowl of huge grilled yet tender surume ika with sauteed mushrooms, miso cucumbers, honey-glazed carrots, furikake and that egg! Need i say more?\n<br />Add $3 for quinoa or $2 for Ninja Rice, Soba or Garden Greens.\n<br />.\n<br />Super satisfying bowl. Ate more than i could thanks to someone.\n<br />.\n<br />#theninjacut #sixthsensepr #squid #bowl #salad
Gorgeous mess of matcha madness to celebrate the end of the week! Matcha \'hotcake\' (because it is flat and nothing like a dense nor fluffy pancake), well-balanced sweetness without being cloying. What we loved were the wonderful play on textures - the hotcake was very light and crisp filled with bittersweet molten matcha that oozes right on the first cut. Topped with chewy homemade dango, refreshingly citrusy candies yuzu peel, fragrant crumble for crunch, azuki beans, finished with a dollop of subtly savoury ricotta cheese and edible flowers. Good to share! 
Looks familiar? Yes, it\'s open by the folks behind Ninja Bowl, but this outlet seated along Seah Street so ninja warriors working around the area can get their healthy fix. Rice bowls available includes Japanese inspired Oh My Cod!, Squid Fix or brunch items such as Salmon Confit and Polenta Mash. Marvellous Matcha is the only dessert dish they created though.
Please, you have to check out this resto 😁😁😁💗💗💗✔✔✔ #cheesyBeKon #burpple
This place has been appearing on my feed so I was curious to try it out!! Really love the mix of ingredients, I know I should have tried something more popular like the squid fix or matcha hot cake but I wanted something light. I wouldn\'t recommend getting this dish just cause I feel like you could just make it at home too (yes I should have know from the description) and the aburi avocado didn\'t do much for me as I like my avos creamy and fresh. Definitely coming back to try the other dishes tho!! Everything on the menu looks really interesting and yummy
With mentaiko cream, torched marshmallows, bacon bits and melted cheese. I loved that the sweet potato fries weren\'t oily!! It all came together really well, though the marshmallows were slightly redundant (maybe if they were gooey that would be better).

Love those crisp edges!\n<br />-\n<br />PS: As the matcha \'hotcake\' is baked to order, it requires a 15-20 minute waiting time.\n<br />-\n<br />#matchamadness #instavideo
It comes with 24-hour braised Japanese curry beef cheek and is impeccably paired with an oozy grilled cheese brioche sandwich. \n<br />After a bite off the sandwich, you would want to have the dish all to yourself. No kidding, the grilled cheese sandwich is so addictive!
Matcha hotcake, homemade dango , Yuzu peel, ricotta cheese, crumble and azuki beans. Hotcake was a little charred on the sides. This actually looks like an extra large version of a matcha lava cake. The green tea fondant was quite thick so it didn\'t flow out as nicely as I thought it would be. Love the crumble on the sides for additional crunchy texture and the Yuzu peel for the citrusy taste. Overall, this is still a very sweet dish that\'s more ideal for sharing
👀\n<br />•\n<br />lines are still a little uneven... but my fingers are deaddd 😩
Probably my favourite out of all the goodies at the newly opened Ninja Cut – the 24-hour slow-cooked beef cheek curry served with wedges of pillowy buttered brioche, from which a stuffing of oozy-gooey cheddar stretches. This is just so goddamn beautiful, I could eat this every damn day.
Every ingredient in the grain bowls offered at Ninja Cut is well-executed — the honey glazed carrots are soft and sweet, the moreish miso cucumbers add a nice crunch and the onsen egg is wobbly, every single time. Located just across Raffles Hotel, this sister outlet of Ninja Bowl in Duxton can accommodate large groups — perfect for a class gathering in town. Unlike Ninja Bowl where the same beef chunks are used in quite a few dishes (not complaining — it\'s so good!), Ninja Cut serves a wider variation of meats including Squid Fix ($18) and What\'s Your Beef? ($18). The former features an entire squid, perfectly grilled on both sides and tender to the bite, while the latter comes with 150g of Australian ribeye, roasted with a pink ring in the centre. Apart from savouries and all-day brunch items, the desserts here are impeccable too.

A DISH.
The test of a well-cooked squid is whether its lusciously tender or chew-till-your-jaw-aches rubbery. The one here fortunately, passed with flying colours. With the sweetish sauce, Japanese seasoning and squirt of fresh lime, this grilled thing of beauty was also really flavourful. Again, I opted for soba as the base, so as to extend the \"Land of the Rising Sun\" theme of my bowl.
Crispy edges and gooey inside, I\'d say it\'s too sweet for my liking but at least the yuzu peel lends its refreshing flavor and the homemade dango gives extra chewiness 🍵🍰🍵\n<br />#letsnomnomSG #theninjacut #foodporn #foodpics #burpple #matcha #hotcakes
Rolled out of bed and straight into three-week-old Ninja Cut for brunch this morning. The two dishes we ordered, \"Waikiki Surf\" ($16 + $2 for Soba) and \"The Hot Cheek\" ($14 + $2 for Ninja Rice), certainly met our expectations in every way.\n<br />To begin with, the vibrant tones and casually stylish plating for both dishes were very pleasing to the eye.\n<br />In terms of taste, the summery-looking \"Waikiki Surf\" was the more refreshing of the two as it comprised of medium-sized cubes of salmon sashimi tossed in a light yuzu and soya sauce dressing, aburi avocado (I have to say, the two wedges were a little too dry and small for my liking though), cherry tomatoes, an onsen egg (now, this was sublime), butter lettuce and crispy Sakura ebi shrimp. The cool soba was the perfect base for this in my opinion, and I found the serving size to be just right. \n<br />Those with bigger appetites or who\'re hankering after something more substantial, will probably be happier with\"The Hot Cheek\". The chunks of beef cheek cooked in a dark Japanese curry was nice and tender but hardly spicy to be honest. However, that doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t tasty because it was. I also liked the sweet corn as it was dressed in a savoury Japanese seasoning. Besides the appearance of another gorgeous onsen egg, the other components in this bowl were equally lovely with the florets of cauliflower adding some crunch and the tomatoes, a burst of fresh juiciness. Some mixed nuts and pickled beets also did their part in jazzing up the flavour profile further.
I\'m sure you\'ve all seen this many times but this creation from Ninja Cut deserves the praise! 🙌
The Ninja range of eateries has always done justice to their vegetables but getting squid right can be tricky. 🤔 But all doubt was dispelled with one bite of the bouncy, tender flesh of the cephalopod. Coupled with the sweet, Japanese-que sauce and yummy range of vegetables that I could just eat on its own has made healthy eating easier than ever!😜
BUGIS is so hapz now. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meaty concept and the amazing MATCHA LAVA HOTCAKE THINGY. More to come in the next few days, meanwhile enjoy the rundown of this amazing concept.
(baked miso cod, pickled beets, honey-glazed carrots, asparagus &amp; edamame, onsen egg) from Ninja Cut. The cod possessed a rugged chewiness of a hiking instructor instead of its usual butteriness, while elsewhere the edamame and asparagus displayed moisturised and supple evidence of a well-thought out skincare routine and the delightfully sweet carrots came across as a sweet but equally starchy sibling of sweet potato. 3.9/5
⠀⠀\n<br />Let\'s imagine you order a dish named \'Korean Ice Kachang\'. What arrives looks undeniably like the ice kachang we know and love - red beans, atap chee, pandan jelly, various colourful syrups - but when your spoon cuts into the icy mountain you discover it is snowy and fine...like bingsu ice. Should you approach the dish as (a) a Korean bingsu with ice kachang toppings or (b) a Singaporean ice kachang with bingsu-style shaved ice? It is an important question, because your overall impression of the dish would vary based on your fundamental concept of what the dish is.\n<br />⠀⠀\n<br />This beautiful creation at the newly-launched Ninja Cut is described as a matcha \'hotcake\' on the menu, but is categorically classified and referenced as a molten lava (pan)cake in most people\'s comments about it, mine included. Does the menu description exceedingly set up people for a pancake-y experience? Are the italics and inverted commas sufficient in informing the average customer that this ain\'t your classic hotcake? Are seals cuter than polar bears? Vital, vital talking points, these.
Lovely fluffy gooey matcha pancakes!! 💚Apparently they call it \"pancakes\" instead of lava cake because sometimes people take too long #forthegram and the matcha just won\'t ooze anymore. Glad to say we didn\'t wait too long to dig in to these babies hehe
-\n<br />Think matcha lava cake in pancake form. Bigger, flatter and more matcha-y.\n<br />The Ricotta is a nice change from all the ice cream we\'ve been seeing.\n<br />Had to rush off and did not get to taste it though. I\'ll definitely be back\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #theninjacut
Poof! \n<br />A clone appeared right where ninja bowl stood.\n<br />-\n<br />So ninja cut their sister branch just opened recently, right across from raffles hotel and boy does it look like a clone!

⠀⠀\n<br />Marvellous Matcha (matcha hotcake, homemade dango, yuzu peel, ricotta cheese, crumble, azuki beans) from the newly-opened Ninja Cut along Seah Street. A hotcake misnomer, this was essentially an oversized, protein shake-fed lava cake with a matcha brownie-esque body and thick, gooey and ever so slightly bitter molten matcha which toes without ever crossing the line of jelat. Elsewhere, the cool and sour-tinged dango gamely provided chew and the yuzu peel possessed explosive citrusy flavour. 3.8/5
There seems to be a Matcha Pancake craze brewing in Singapore of the late, especially when there are a number of cafes coming up with their own iteration of the dish. This is Ninja Cut\'s version (it\'s by the same people behind Ninja Bowl) — a super decadent pancake that is like a hybrid of the decadent and rich Sarnie\'s Matcha White Chocolate Brownie and an incredibly oozesome (and large) matcha lava cake. The oozy sauce carries a good amount of matcha aroma and sweetness, but the entire pancake was pretty well-balanced for two to share. They have played with the flavour combinations well, introducing zesty and zingy flavours such as the lemon-ny tinge on their chewy homemade Dango, the candied Yuzu peels and Ricotta Cheese to neutralize all the flavours if it ever gets too much as well as texture where the speculoos crumbles give it a sweet crunch. Definitely worth coming for if a huge, oozy, flatter version of a matcha lava cake is something you often dream about.
Ninja Cut is by the same people behind Ninja Bowl; the cuts menu here therefore is pretty reminiscent to the offerings by Ninja Bowl though the main differences seems to be more focused on the meats offered. This plate comes with Cha Shu Pork Roulade, Honey-glazed carrots, Pickled Beets, Onsen Egg, Asparagus and Edamame. It\'s a pretty hearty bowl for one, especially with the sizable portions of meat after you add your desired carbs ($3 for quinoa, $2 for soba, Ninja Rice — brown and white rice or garden greens. Generally most of the components are mildly sweet (even the edamame and carrots) and helps to add a different flavour profile to the Cha Shu slices which are pretty savoury with a smoky flavour. Pretty wholesome, and pretty easy to finish.
For $18, you get to have the craziest experience with thick grilled cheese sandwich and beef. It was an experience we won\'t forget. Yummy! 👍🏻
🤔 But I enjoyed it anyway, nicely cooked #seafood in a #creamy, tasty #mentaiko sauce. Head over to @theninjacut\'s IG to see the pics of the original \'Oceans of Seafood\' ($18++) in all its glory! 😂

This resembles salmon poke which was the hype recently. Only tried the avocado mash which was really fresh and added creaminess to the dish. \n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan
Didn\'t know they revamped their menu again. At the same time, prices of some old the old items were hiked. Dishes came out to be of good quality though. Pumpkin mash served cold was sweet and refreshing, but the ninja rice was merely a mixed of brown rice and Japanese grain. The highlight was the pulled-beef tenderloin that was surprisingly soft and flavourful, just that it\'s slightly salty. Portion was decent, definitely too small if the carbs weren\'t added. \n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan

\"Happy Hula\", one of the items found in the new menu.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Bright like a sunny day. So very tropical. Mango, coconut ice cream, passionfruit, coconut slivers and almond flakes on a flattened croissant. I rather enjoyed the explosion of the tangy and zesty flavors. The coconut ice cream sweetens the sizzles of the passionfruit. Passionfruit was my fave as it perks up the whole dessert with its natural twang and tantalizes the discerning tastebuds.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />I could do without the croissant. Other than that, a zingy dessert to wake you up. \n<br />#dessertlover #desserts #hawaiian #burpple #igers #foodgasm #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #openricesg #stfoodtrending #photographers #photooftheday #bloggerlife #bloggersg #bloggers #cafehoppersg #cafesg #instafoodsg #tropical #ninjacutsg

Pair it with the juicy scallops or if you like Shabu Pork, you can opt for this combination too. I love everything about this dish except that it was too galicky for the non-garlic eating me.

💖✨ New menu up at @theninjacut that\'s worth an indulgence ! 👍🏻 [PS: this is not a sponsored invite/post.]
Do squeeze some lime juice as its tanginess enhanced the \"grill\" flavour further. I wasn\'t not a fan of the carrots, which I found quite tough to bite (prefer the soft ones for my lazy teeth ☺️). I suggest you get some carbs because the meal was not that filling, especially if you\'re (constantly) hungry. Glad that finally I tried this much-hyped grain bowl, but at the same time, I reached the conclusion that healthy grain bowls are not my thing.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #whati8today #8dayseat #VSCOcam #vscofood #japan #food #rice #eatoutsg #openricesg #brunchsituation #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodart #sgfood #instafood #igfood #SingaporeInsiders #onthetable #exsgcafes #foodphotography #hungrygowhere #eat #tslmakan #sgig #sgcafefood #wheretoeat

The bread is a good absorber of sauce, which is a little too salty on its own.

Char Siew with onsen egg sounded promising but unfortunately the meat was rather dry and tasteless. In fact, it was overpowered by the very sour pickled lotus roots and salty vegetables. I thought healthy food shouldn\'t have so much salt and sourness? Another part which we didn\'t understand was why their bowls didn\'t come with any base and one would have to top up for the staple for a more decent meal. Also had their grilled squid which was similarly problematic in the saltiness. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #healthy #charsiew

Most importantly, it is also a light bulb + electric shock + \"Grilling people\" day... (Certain \'PhD\' people should know what I mean).. Haha...\n<br />#TheNinjaCut #whatsyourbeef #squidfix #marvellousmatcha #burpple #caloriesoverload #noisterandjas #jaslynfoodinstagram

Awesome lava hotcake that\'s not very sweet and looks pretty as well!😍💕😋 P.S. It\'s quite a big portion so sharing would be a better opinion.. #burpple

🔼🔼\n<br />The squid was chewy but not overdone. However, the sauce was a tad salty simply because I prefer to taste more of the natural sweetness of the squid. If there was less salt, I think I could polished this off on my own. I could forego the egg cos it is all about the squid.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />A wonderful lunch spent with my fave foodies. \n<br />#lunchwithfriends #hungrygowhere #burpplemessyeats #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #tripadvisor #narratrs #stfoodtrending #sgbloggers #sgig #sgfoodies #eatbooksg #eatliststar #discoversg #chopesg #topfoodnews #singaporeinsiders #ninjacut
You got to try this grilled cheese sandwich if you visit @theninjacut ! Served with Japanese curry beef cheek that is seasoned with red wine and braised for 24 hours! 😍\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #instafood #whati8today #setheats #burpple #foodporn #foodstagram #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #sgfoodunion #thisisinsiderfood #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #onthetable
😉 For $18, you\'ll get a whole grilled #squid paired with a perfect onsen #egg, sauteed mushrooms, miso cucumbers and honey glazed carrots (+$3 for quinoa). 😍 A whole lot of ❤️ on a plate. Happy #weekend!\n<br />#brunch #lunch #ninjacut #yummy #sgfood #foodpics #burpple
chimichurri sauce, sauteed brussel sprouts, cherry tomatoes, grilled corn furikake, mixed nuts and an onsen egg. We added quinoa ($3) for the base. The highlight for this bowl has to be the chimichurri sauce that elevated the whole enjoyment of the tender and juicy sous-vide chicken breast.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafe #cafehoppingsg #ninjacut
It comes with a whole Japanese squid that is first brushed with a sweet secret recipe sauce blend before it is gently grilled. The bouncy tender rings of squid is accompanied by sauteed mushrooms, miso cucumbers, honey-glazed carrots, furikake and onsen egg. We added garden greens ($2) for the bowl. I probably would add the ninja rice in my next visit for a more substantial meal.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #squid

The rendition of the southern creole breakfast of pork and grits rendition at Ninja Cut comes with warm truffle polenta mash, sauteed mushrooms, shaved Parmesan cheese and aburi pork slices. A hearty and comforting dish that can be enjoyed anytime of the day.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #polenta #breakfast #brunch

For the base we added Soba ($2) to complete the meal. A highlight of the bowl is the umami-filled saikyo shiomiso from Kyoto, giving the buttery cod fish an additional layer of sweetest.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #codfish #ninjacut

It comes with grilled corn furikake, sauteed mushroom, onsen egg, honey-glazed carrots and garlic chips. Be early if you want to have this as it is limited to only 30 servings per day.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #ninjacut #beef #bowl
Upping a notch at Ninja Cut is the 24 hour braised Japanese curry beef cheek, that is seasoned with red wine and braised for a full day in the curry for a full bodied flavour. The other star item on the plate is the grilled cheese brioche sandwich that is so good on its own. Mop the gravy with the sandwich to soak up that beautiful flavour.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #braisedpork #cheese #sandwich #breakfast #brunch
The matcha aroma fills the air when the cake is served piping hot. \n<br />Soft , moist and decadent with every bite, the brackish layer of salted egg yolk draw a gleeful distinction from the rich, earthy tones of matcha

Healthy meal with an option of three different base - garden greens, soba or ninja rice. Another lovely #yolkporn for lunch :)
NEH.. who am i kidding? The Sims are embarking on an epic honeymoon to Norway and Denmark! 😄😄😄 Stay tight to your cellphones for updates.

Enjoy your weekend everyone !
Its sensuous texture is already more than worth the price alone and you will find its juiciness absolutely irresistable

YEH.. this would make you bang on the cages of your office cells begging to be free.
The {Marvellous Matcha} fulfills and exceeds all expectations. The \'hotcake\' is a less towering version of the usual fondant cake baked till crisp and topped with ricotta cheese, edible flowers, speculoos crumble and home-made dango for a winsome combination of epic proportions. Definitely one of the best desserts this whole year.
Having a variety of greens to complement the ripeye will make the dish more appetizing
For S$18, you\'ll get a whole grilled Japanese Squid (super value for money) brushed with Ninja Cut secret recipe, served with sauteed mushrooms, miso cucumbers, honey-glazed carrots and furikake. \n<br />Don\'t get me started on their all day brunch menu! Aiyoyo, super delicious also! You HAVE TO order The Cheeky Cheese S$18 for there is some kind of magic, once-you-bite-you-cannot-stop oozy grilled cheese sandwich! #theninjacut #yummy #onmytable #love #topcitybites #stfoodtrending #cafehopping #exploresingapore #sharefood #sgeat #nikonsg #nikon5500 #burpple #singaporeinsiders

Ohhh.... how I love the fresh thick slices of coconut swimming in real coconut juice. Plus the citrussy tangy lemon. It was a tall tall glass and I slurped it all up. Highly recommended for cooling off the body.
