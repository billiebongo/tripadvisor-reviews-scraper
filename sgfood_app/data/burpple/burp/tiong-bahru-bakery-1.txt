Wide range of pastries to choose from! Definately a good spot for afternoon tea with your loved ones. 
The Running Egg croissant with ramen eggs and bonito flakes was the clear winner of the day. To me, the new lemon tarts from @tiongbahrubakery are way overrated. The curd held up well, perhaps a little too well. I\'d much prefer my curd to have more of a thick consistency than a gelatinous texture. At level 3, you get a huge hit of citrus - perfect for someone who\'s looking for one. Lemon tart lovers will enjoy the #elecitrusity but it\'s safe to say I am not a fan of super sour lemon jelly. Give me two Running Egg croissants NAO.
Other then the zesty lemony tarts, @tiongbahrubakery have also launched 8 other artisan desserts. Made from scratch with the finest ingredients and it\'s just lip-smacking GOOD!
I always liked citrusy flavours and I knew I had to try this lemon tart when it was making its rounds on Instagram! TBB is definitely thoughtful to come up with three levels of sourness/tanginess for these tarts. I find the level two one a good mix of sourness and sweetness, and I\'m looking forward to trying a level three one! ($6.50)

Crumbly tart holding somewhat like a sphere of lemon curd - personally level 2 &amp; 3 appeals more to me as I really love sour stuff! But Level 2 best because of the slight hint of sweetness (desserts still has to be sweet huh?), while the sourness really making the overall less gelat as I could easier finish the whole thing myself. \n<br />Apart from the Lemon Tart, they rolled out more desserts like my favourite - the dark chocolaty Brownie ($6), or the Berries Tart ($8.50) that was given a new softer tart base with some pistachio love. \n<br />Now, a new month with 30 more days to complete more things! Go go gooooo! (But don\'t forget to reward yourself with a lemon tart along the way 😏)
🍋🍋🍋 To cater to individual, each crusty tart shells are filled with generous mound of tangy lemon curd customised for your palates, easily identify by the lightning bolt.
My favorite got to be the Brownie with pecans ($6), while the best seller in this combination is the Chocolate Tart ($7.50) made with smooth luscious dark chocolate!

Best croissant in neighborhood (or maybe in the country). It\'s very crispy and you can really taste the greentea and the nuts well in the croissant.
Yes, I\'m a spoiled brat who demands a satisfying breakfast every morning. Fret not, a simple pastry will suffice. TBB\'s kouign amann is not only a simple swirl of sugar-y pastry, it\'s also delicately addictive. (P/S: beware, the process of making it is not simple at all!)
Had a rather disappointing cup of coffee earlier, this however was really good. Tiong Bahru bakery\'s coffee hasn\'t disappoint after countless of visits. 
very.
here\'s to better health!
These are the relatively new creations by TBB and they\'re actually rather tasty! The XLB one tasted like gyoza haha. But as usual, their croissants are just the right bit of buttery and flaky. 👌👍
Our favourite was the Xiao Long Bao!
Ain\'t really much into croissants, but having more of such pastries of the late I have came to understand croissants a little more. Wasn\'t much of a fan of TBB\'s croissant in the past, but I finally learnt to appreciate the flakiness on the exterior, yet a fluffy, buttery interior that isn\'t too dense not dry.
Dinner was reduced to this cause the service team forgot my Kouign Aman and Croissant. We were surprised by the fairly pleasant SG50 durian éclair, which had a light yet tasty durian filling with discernable fruit bits. The pastry was a tad dense though, which could be a result of drying out a little in my fridge.
Our favourite was the Xiao long bao which tasted like the original version, except kiap in between a croissant.
The innovative folks at TBB have cooked up 4 new savory crossiants, taking inspiration from dishes we all love today such as molten egg ramen, xiao long bao etc. Available daily from 1130am-3pm at all TBB outlets. \n<br />More details on jacqsowhat.com (link in bio) and not forgetting their Kouign Amann, keep me coming back for more. 😛 #TiongBahruBakery
Exotic leh.
Available at all Tiong Bahru bakery outlets from 1130am - 3pm daily. Thank you @tiongbahrubakery for having us ☺️
You can order a meal set that includes 2 croissants and a salad here at 12 dollars plus. The choices are (from btm to top) molten ramen egg, xiao long bao, artisanal onion jam with sausage and rolling dumpling. I personally think the best will be the xiao long bao croissant as it does give the xiao long bao taste without hiding away the crisp of the croissant covered in sesame. 😝\n<br />#burpple
With a tangy, zesty lemon curd, chewy choux pastry shell, topped with a light, airy torched meringue.
Light, delicate puff pastry alternates with sweet vanilla cream. The pastry cracks beautifully, but the rich, smooth cream makes eating rather messy!
Named after the French opera ballet dancers, the coffee soaked almond sponge cake, layered with coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache, is delightful.
The light, chewy choux pastry has a generous filling of sweet hazelnut praline cream. Tasty, but best shared as it\'s rather rich!
;) if you know where else to get good quiches, I need to know. 😁
Usually the person to leave out crusts, I actually like this nutty crust!
Weekends &amp; cakes go so well together~ Here\'s featuring 3 out of 8 new offerings by TBB - Opera Cake, Slipper Chocolate Tart &amp; Tropical Cheese Cake!
Fluffy and delicious pastries, accompanied by freshly brewed coffee to get your day off to a satisfying start! 
Coffee and croissant break
Special creations this festive season up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com link in bio!
Baker Gontran Cherrier has reinvented this traditional delicacy into a contemporary western style of pastry, with velvety pineapple mousse sitting atop a crisp sugar biscuit base, topped with light coconut chantilly cream, white chocolate disc, and a dash of edible gold leaves for flamboyant touch. I loved it light and not overly sweet like what you normally get from the traditional kind, it\'s definitely a healthier choice of goodie to savour this festival! [Photo taken with D610, thanks to #NikonSingapore]
🍊 •\n<br />1. Pineapple and coconut tart - an Angmoh version of pineapple tart? 😂 Whatever it is, this is my fav among the 3!😍😋 2. Chocolate and hazelnut Kouign Amann - Chef Gontran Cherrier\'s Kouign Amann can never go wrong. 👍 3. Orange and chocolate marble cake - plain as compared to the previous 2. Would be ideal if you\'ll looking for something light! Goes especially well with a cup of tea!😌 •\n<br />These special creations will be available at all Tiong Bahru Bakery outlets from now till 3rd March! 😊
From now till 15 Feb, get your hands on these cute not-so-little macaroon hearts from @tiongbahrubakery for your loved ones or as a prop to ask your crush out on a date! 😏 A much more creative way than using flowers eh?
Not all of us might buy into the hype, but there’s still a bit of a romantic which you can get for your special one without overspending on Valentine\'s Day. Pretty pink heart shaped macaroon shell cradles fragrant nougat cream and fresh strawberries, a $8.50 Valentine\'s Day special by Tiong Bahru Bakery might just work for you. Je t\'aime ❤️
Love the Saboyard at @tiongbahrubakery with its yummy mix of bacon, cheese and tomatoes! Super love for the quiche Lorraine too (I only eat theirs these days). Happy weekend people! #thursdayisthenewfriday #carbmonster
This chocolate hazelnut KA is like a chocolate pain but less buttery. I would have toasted it for an additional crisp but this is still pretty good on its own. The CNY specials are in stores already and I approve of the pineapple coconut tart too! On the people front, i finally met the delicate @alexcrumb. Such coincidence to be at the same place twice in a day! 😊 and hello to @foodolicious1 @ig_honeybeesweets and @therantingpanda.
Inspired by our favorite CNY snack, the Pineapple and coconut tart ($8.50) consists of a smooth fragrant pineapple mousse atop a sugar dough base, topped with fresh coconut Chantilly cream and a white chocolate disc. Not forgetting the BLING gold leaf for the finishing touch.
The Pineapple coconut tart ($8.50/tart) features a velvety smooth pineapple mousse sitting on a crisp sugar-dough base, topped with fresh coconut chantilly cream and white chocolate disc, plus a touch of the gold leaves giving the dessert a luxurious look. This tropical creation will be available at all Tiong Bahru Bakery outlets from 2nd Feb till 3rd March.
Ok I don\'t know what it\'s exactly called but.. I know I was very disappointed by this. \n<br />MY ALMOND CROISSANT IS STILL THE BOMB.
Satisfied my quiche craving but the tart was soggy and a tad undercooked today. #wonDoughful #tiongbahrubakery
because consistency have me back here again and again, that\'s why.
If you\'ve always liked the original Kouign Amann, I\'m pleased to tell you that 3 new flavours of Kouign Amann is available in all outlets now.\n<br />They\'re Gula Melaka and Chocolate • Gula Melaka and Grated Coconut • Gula Melaka and Crushed Peanuts.\n<br />Sadly, I\'ve only tried the Crushed Peanuts version because the other 2 was sold out.\n<br />I\'ll be back for more.
The prosciutto ham which they\'re quite generous with, is chewy but very flavourful. Complementing that is an underlying layer of mozzarella cheese. Bitter-ish arugula and a few thinly-sliced shallots add the important finishing touches to this delectable sandwich.
The best sister in the world @hungrybaker got it for my breakfast. Very very filling! Coconut taste and sweetness of the gula Melaka also very discernible.
☺️ Remember about the #gontrangoeslocal project that Chef Gontran Cherrier has embarked? Here are his winning creations, all with the infusion of GULA MELAKA in our favourite kouign amanns!\n<br />1. Kouign Amanns Gula Melaka Chocolate \n<br />2. Kouign Amanns Gula Melaka Crushed Peanuts\n<br />3. Kouign Amanns Gula Melaka Coconut \n<br />Kouign Amanns Gula Melaka Crushed Peanuts is my fav of all! Try it let me know which do you prefer?😉 Thank you @tiongbahrubakery for the sweetest thought.😌
Three delish variations of the new Gula Melaka Kouign Amann from Tiong Bahru Bakery outlets. They are Crushed Peanuts and Gula Melaka, Chocolate and Gula Melaka, and lastly Grated Coconut and Gula Melaka Kouign Amann. 
Open-faced sandwiches always look so attractive, don\'t they? With fillings blatantly displayed, it\'s easy to decide quite quickly if they appeal to you or not. Such was the case for me with this tuna focaccia.\n<br />I was drawn to the visual appeal of the generous amount of mayo-free tuna, tomatoes and baby arugula. Once I bit into the sandwich, I was downright smittened. The well-dressed tuna positively surged with flavour. Harmonising with it like a talented \"a capella\" troupe were the cooked-till-soft tomatoes, sliced onions and crisp bitter-ish rocket leaves. The thick piece of herb-laden focaccia bread did a great job of anchoring all the yumminess. 
Rolled up like a snail, the buttery pastry is flaky, crisp and aromatic. I am impressed by how successful their Asian twist on this classically French pastry is. Then again, \"gula melaka\" is simply so good in everything it\'s added to, isn\'t it? With fragrant coconut thrown in, the deliciousness gets doubled. Exceptionally lovely with a cup of coffee or tea. 
Not soft enough, kinda tough and chewy. Tried tbb for the 3rd time and all 3 times I left disappointed. Way overhyped 
The quiche here was a little bigger than the ones at Artisan Boulangerie &amp; Co. But not necessarily better tasting even though it contained chicken, mushroom and tomatoes. I think it is because I personally favour a crisp buttery shell for my quiche. To me, the harder pastry creates a lovely contrast with the creamy and soft cheesy filling. So yeah, this was decent enough but my heart belongs to the quiches at Artisan Boulangerie &amp; Co.
Most hotdogs focus on the sausage but hardly on the bun. But the bun in this case, isn\'t treated like an afterthought; which shouldn\'t be a surprise given that this is from Tiong Bahru BAKERY ;)\n<br />The soft, slightly chewy bread which forms the bun, has evenly distributed black sesame seeds and a topping of toasted strings of cheese. So each bite packs in extra texture and flavour. Also, the bread bun is wound around the spicy, coarsely-ground pork sausage, rather than simply clasping it; making it far more secure to eat because the sausage doesn\'t slide around.\n<br />If you\'re feeling peckish, I reckon this makes a tasty and value-for-money snack anytime of the day.
Yes he\'s in town now! Such a pleasure to be able to meet him and to pick up tips from his sharing session. There are so much thoughts put into our bread (from TBB of course) and it\'s topping. 👍 Not to mention he\'s a super nice and humorous gentleman!☺️ Of course the session wouldn\'t be complete without some yummy bread and pastries from the bakery. 😍😋👍 (ps: checkout my dayre for more of the sharing!😉)
20 lucky winners will stand a chance to meet the man himself on 6th September at Raffles City from 2pm to 3:30pm. We heard that the chef will also be present at the Cafe Fest SG. Head over to the TBB Facebook page now for more details.
Pretty..fresh raspberries..lovely texture of tart..loving every bit of this little thing
😅\n<br />First stop: TBB! Iced latte x Cappuccino x Croissant x Kouign Amann x Berries Crumble
Synonymous with Tiong Bahru Bakery is their signature pastry - the royally delicious Kouign Amann. This flaky, buttery, caramelized, sugar-filled pastry is the stuff dreams are made of. Thank you, Gontran Cherrier. Paired with coffee brewed by the award-winning 40 Hands, it\'s the perfect treat. You might want to try the canele too, their latest addition. It\'s ok, go right ahead and treat yourself to both pastries, we won\'t judge ;)
#tbt Brunch I had a few days back at Tiong Baru Bakery! Finally satisfied my cravings for cafe food 😋 \n<br />Croissants (not shown) that are crowned the best in Singapore - honesty felt that it was medicore 🙊 a let down as the crust was not as crispy and buttery as u expected. I could have gotten better ones else where.
Came across lot of reviews of one of its signature pastry - Kouign Amann before I step into the bakery. Fall in love with it on my first bite. Try it if you drop by the bakery and you will know how good it taste. 
After such a long time of cafe hopping, I\'m back to TBB for good reliable tea time treats. :) Having the original Kouign Aman, which is soft and buttery like a croissant, but also chewy cause of the caramel. Perfect with a latte, which I find much stronger and more bitter than what is served at other cafes. (A quick google search reveals that TBB uses beans from Forty Hands... No wonder!) I also like the plain croissant and berry crumble, which may be a little too sweet for some but the coffee balances out everything ;) I didn\'t fancy the burgers and a baked cheesy dried tomato dish the last time, so I\'d say stick to the sweet items.
A change from the usual brunch food. Raisin brioche with cappuccino.
1st stop: Tiong Bahru Bakery! Ordered their famed croissant and Kouign Amann! Need some carbs to restore the calories burnt during our yoga session earlier on!
I love anything with smoked salmon! The squid ink bun is tasty on its own, thou I find it a bit salty when have it with the smoked salmon but I really like the burger. 

The mixed berries tart was really interesting. Instead of a full tart base, it came with a little bit of sponge cake at the centre of the tart. Berries were very fresh and came served very generously! ($8.80)
Both were equally fantastic! The dough used is of quality and really chewy to bite. Highly recommend Tiong bahru bakery!
A dessert that fares better to those whom prefers  sour desserts to sweet ones. Pineapple chunks, mangoes and passionfruit contributes to the tartness of the tart, while the mousse helps neutralise the sourness and introduce a subtle sweetness to it. A somewhat unique tart to have.
#tiongbahrubakery was our next stop! Wanted to try the highly recommended almond croissant but they ran out of it! \n<br />We had a salted caramel thingy instead and a berry crumble. Not exaggerating but I nearly teared while eating these because they were amazing. I could die then and die a very happy fatty. Seriously, you guys got to try this!
And dessert fix. Can always count on #tiongbahrubakery to make things right.
Not the best chocolate croissant $3.8 and not the best hot chocolate $6.5 but hot chocolate art makes up for it 
Not a fan of coffee but this was not too bad. Rich tiramisu!
I half expected the chocolate lava to trickle down the cake when I cut into it but it didn\'t. Still tasted good,  the chocolate was really rich.
Good morning, beautiful: In all honesty, although  the croissant may not make a fan out of me, it was much better than I expected it to be. Despite its thick crust, I found meat nice and chewy. Could be more buttery, but nothing my stash of President can\'t fix. The quest for the perfect croissant continues on the island. | #breakfast #croissant #food
Don\'t you even dare touch those. I on the other hand bought a whole lot of bread (I blame one Squid Ink Baguette which opened the buying floodgates). I\'ve been uninspired for the past year to purchase anything from them. Guess the carbs-shield failed today. Oh well. | #food #bread #shopaholic #bread
Coz eating at the bakery itself is just too mainstream... Hah, too many people inside the bakery actually~~~ Finally!
Caramelized pastry that is reallyyy good, those with a sweet-tooth will love this. It kind of reminded me of the buttery snack I ate from Four Leaves last time as well!
Squid ink bun with prosciutto, tomatoes, and veggies. One unique experience from great baker in town.
Have had their famous croissant and it is really awesome! The bread was soft and crunchy in the way that makes me feel in love with! Dear croissant I fell for you again , and again and again ... One for $2.80 
I swear it is impossible to just choose one. And the Pandan Croissant was better than their plain Croissant!
Dinner treat from K! Black Pesto Bun (Salmon, Ham, Pesto) S$8.50
On a wet rainy afternoon.... Took leave to relax in a cafe. Nice but not spectacular. What u think?
Freshly-baked artisanal pastries from yesterday\'s visit to TBB. How do you like this place?
Ham &amp; Cheese Bun at Tiong Bahru Bakery ... Only wanna try out their Squid Bun but sold out :( anyway.... A little over rated
Finally trying out TBB! Croissant, Chocolate Brioches, Mixed Berries Crumbles and Guacamole with @lifeinsuitcase @brynleegr @mfrancesca #rachfoodadventure
One of the better rectangular tarts! @dacookieman You had this the other time right?
I was so upset when I didn\'t see them on the counter when I stepped into the bakery BUT the staff came to me in less than 10 mins telling me that they have freshly baked ones that just came out of the oven! Bliss 😍😍😁😁
Kouign amann - addictive buttery caramel pastry. This makes me so happy☺
Grapefruit and mandarin tart - looked pretty but tasted blah. I\'d totally give this a pass. 😒
Pretty damn good sea salt and caramel pastry. Warm, chewy, crispy and not overwhelmingly sweet - @dacookieman and @joshua_ng loved this too. Must try!!
Sunday brunch with great company @dacookieman and @joshua_ng. We should definitely do this again!
Some pastry we ordered: Clockwise from top left: Extremely yummy caramel pastry, Must order chocolate and almost croissant, Disappointing chocolate croissant and Pear tart.
Almond and chocolate croissant - which was my favorite yesterday afternoon. Dotted with plenty of almond flakes all over, filled with a nice almond and chocolate paste inside(which was not too sweet too) and dusted with icing sugar to top it all off. Yum!
Roasted vegetables and mozzarella baguette ($8.50); simple meatless pleasure

Underneath it all I\'m held captive by the hole inside.
Who does not know Tiong Bahru Bakery?!
First time trying an Opera cake and as it seems it is made with chocolate ganache, almond sponge cake and coffee buttercream. This one tasted pretty coherent, with smooth chocolate ganache a layer of lightly flavoured coffee buttercream; pretty similar to the coffee-flavoured buttercream cakes of the past but less buttery. Then beneath comes the almond-speckled cake which is evident of the nutty flavours before it repeats itself again. Pretty luxurious, and definitely hit those who do not like plain chocolate cakes that taste rather flat.
The bright orange color of the fruits also symbolizes \'gold\', hence considered as auspicious symbols that are in synch with CNY customs. This is @tiongbahrubakery\'s CNY take on the marble cake.
😹😹😹 #vapidfooddescription \n<br />Never knew I can still be so cheerful despite what happened in the afternoon. Ever switch on your phone to realize all your pictures intended for latergram disappearing into thin air? I did. 400+ of them. Only manage to salvage(painstakingly)1/3 of them from Dropbox. Majority of my fav archie &amp; foodshots all gone. Life uh life. Irony is I did backup, to my SD card, but it play me out so what can I do? Suck thumb luh. Neber mind, life still carries on. :D
Baking pineapple tarts for Chinese New Year is a yearly affair at home for many families in Singapore. However, these goodies are also widely available at many confectioneries during this festive season. This is Tiong Bahru Bakery\'s take on this little CNY icon, the Pineapple-Coconut Tart.
the #galettedesrois and the #Canelé from @tiongbahrubakery!\n<br />This is #Góugǒu and #Bearbrick\'s debut trip to #tiongbahrubakery and they instantly fell in love with this place. The 3 of us unanimously reckon that the Galette Des Rois, aka King\'s Cake should be serve all year round! #TBB you hear us?!? 😹😹😹😹 [ Tiong Bahru Bakery by Gontran Cherrier\n<br />56 Eng Hoon Street\n<br />Singapore 160056\n<br />6220 3430] \n<br />#gontrancherrier #56enghoonstreet #enghoonstreet #tiongbahru #communityfirst #burpple #vscofood #foodstagram #foodshot #foodgasm #foodie #foodpics #foodporn #foodpornsg #foodstamping #ilovefood #getinmybelly #eatandeat #madaboutsingapore #cafehopping #cafehoppingteam #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping

Available at all TBB stores from 2 Feb to 3 March.
This, the La Speciale is done with a twist, the light crispy pink puff pastry encases sweet almond cream that\'s punctuated with sugar-coated almonds and ginger for an Asian kick!\n<br />#tiongbahrubakery #gontrancherrier #enghoonstreet #56enghoonstreet #tiongbahru #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping #cafehoppingteam #onthetable #burpple #vscofood #communityfirst #foodstagram #foodshot #foodgasm #foodie #foodpics #foodporn #foodpornsg #foodstamping #ilovefood #getinmybelly #eatandeatt
