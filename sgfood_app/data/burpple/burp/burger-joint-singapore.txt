In this blistering crazy madness heat, you need a pint of beer. Or make that a couple more pints. Burger Joint, straight out from New York and onto our sunny shore, brings a good collection (18 types) of beer! For someone who isn\'t into beers, American craft beers apparently have something that definitely suit each individual tastebuds. Be it malty, fruity (which I love), stout, and all, there is definitely something for everyone! The best part, the owners are happy to allow you to have a shot, before buying yourself a pint. Talk about walking into a ice-cream shop! 
Burger Joint has arrived on our shores and taken residence in a swanky little space along Amoy Street.
(not mine) Excellent for the ravenous but pricey ($25?) Place was crowded at  6pm on Saturday, with a fast-food ordering system. Cashier was perfunctory at best, probably cost her to smile. Not being racist but you\'d expect Caucasian service crews to be friendlier. This hole in the wall was quite chaotic, go when you have patience.
No fancy gimmicky sauces or ingredients - just beef and cheese and lettuce and tomatoes and the usual ketchup sauce. Reaaally good! Even for someone who rarely eats burgers hahaha. The brownie was fudgey and chocolatey but too sweet for my liking.
This inconspicuous burger shack has no signboard whatsoever, only a neon burger sign with an arrow directing you to a door in the back alley of Gemmill Lane. Don\'t be alarmed by its shady appearance; step inside with a few friends and enjoy the sight of chunky beef patties and crispy bacon slices sizzling on the grill, 18 craft beers on tap and doodle-friendly walls with blast from the past movie posters (spot our hand drawn Burpple doodles!). The menu is written on makeshift signboards pinned to the side of the cashier. While we would recommend the Double Bacon Cheeseburger ($27.40) for its super satisfying quality, it comes with a hefty price tag. Instead, go for the Cheeseburger ($13.80) with the medium-well, juicy beef patty and get the Fries ($5.50) to fill your hungry belly. Ask for \"the works\" ‚Äî lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, ketchup, mayo and mustard sauce before seasoning your patty with a tiny bit of salt and pepper that is readily available on each table. \n<br />Avg price: $20 per person
Thick juicy patty with the right doneness (medium rare in my case, thank you very much). No frills or claims of Wagyu beef needed; just delicious burgers!
Located just beside Maggie Joan\'s, I would say this is kinda hidden for anyone who is not famliar with the location. Spotted  several of my fav CRAFT BEER ON TAP! Woohoo which is just perfect for an awesome TGIF!\n<br />üì∑ cr: @stormscape\n<br />On the side note, I just did my nails at @3d_nails! Chio right?

This burger joint, literally called ‚ÄúBurger Joint‚Äù has opened its first in Singapore.
Finding your way to the obscure @BurgerJointSG may be complicated, but ordering grub here is straightforward.
Juicy hearty cheese burger w a big slab of patty, onions, lettuce, cheeseeee &amp; pickles! Buns could be improved for better texture &amp; patty needs more seasoning but otherwise, a really juicy burger :) #BURGS
The patty was awesome, juicy and tasty. And the price is quite reasonable, around $14 for a Cheeseburger (The one I ate, that\'s pictured above, is double patty and double bacon at $27.) Apart from that, the bun was normal and the fries were underwhelming. If you have a one burger a month quota, it\'d still be better to spend a little more and get your fix at Omakase. (Rating:üòÄ)
The fuss-free, 60-seater #BurgerJointSG will open its doors 3 May 2016. Address is Amoy Street, but you‚Äôll need to enter from Gemmill Lane just behind.
Cool place and juicy burger
Ok, that\'s all.

With only a mix between jalape√±os, bacon and cheese for their juicy beef burger, the taste certainly made up for the lack of variety on their menu. The ingredients used shouted American burger, non-pretentious and satisfying. Loved that the burger was not salty nor oily.\n<br />One and only in SG, this place is highly recommended for anyone into a good burger. Also enjoy a good beer from their range of craft beers and spend some time exploring the graffiti drawings on their wall. Add on to it when you get inspired. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #burger
A huge step up from processed fast food burgers, but not luxe enough to be gourmet. #thisCuriousCraving #epicuration #burpple‚†Ä
This NY burger joint might not have much variety on its menu, but its burgers were definitely worth all the calories. This was their cheeseburger with jalape√±os and crispy bacon. Its beef patty was thick, juicy and delicious. Wrapped in paper when served, it was the best way to bite through the entire thick burger with all the flavours. \n<br />1 thing to note is that they only serve beef meat patty; non-beef eater can consider their portobello burger though. \n<br />Another plus point would be their bar counter that offers a wide variety of interesting in-house beer concoctions. Simply loved the whole feel, food and drink of the place that would transport one out of SG, for an awesome American meal. #burrple  #burpplesg #sgfoodies #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #sgfoodspotting #sgfoodunion #foodgram #instafood_sg #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #burpproved #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgmakandiary #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #stfoodtrending #burger
in a classic American style brown paper bag.\n<br />Once unwrap, the burger looked ordinary, dull and even small.. didn\'t think much of it till I took the first bite! Hmm... I like the patty! It\'s fast food style but only to taste like a very good fast food burger.. kinda like Omakase burger or even freshness.. it\'s moist, juicy and has a beefy taste. The patty size is average.. not to thin.. quite a nice size to bite into.. I generally love the patty! However, I\'m not too sure what cheese they used cause I can\'t seem to taste it.. it\'s either not strong enough or somehow it got melted along the way.. anyway I will be back for sure to try the doubles!
Got a cheeseburger (medium for the beef patty) + full works (less the pickles) from this burger joint that originated in NYC. Love the light crisp of the bun and the juicy patty! $10 with the @entertainersg app üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple @burpple #hungrygowhere @hungrygowhere #entertainerapp #burgerjointsg #cheeseburger @burgerjointsg #entertainerwithjo
The jalape√±os definitely hit the spot, New York here I come!! üòé
Yes please
It\'s a wonder how those buns hold up so well üí™A firm vegetarian choice should you be hitting the burger joint soon
Pick from a formidable selection of bourbons to customise your very own Manhattan or Old Fashioned
I had to try it immediately and that satisfaction when I find it to be (almost) similar to NYC‚Äôs is pure happiness. I‚Äôve not tried enough burgers to compare but I rate Omakase‚Äôs burgers really high and Burger Joint is its new rival. But what actually stole the spotlight is THE FRIES..!! OMG.. best fries evaaaahh..!! .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burgerjointsingapore #burger #burgerjoint #fries #milkshake #nyc #dinner #burpple #diner #cafe #cafesg #eatoutsg #food #foodie #foodonfoot #foodphotography #foodpics #foodporn #foodstagram #foodspotting #instafood #nomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #singapore #yummy #sogood
So satisfying, it hit the right spots.  One word of advise, be prepared to queue up! It\'s also located in a very discreet area where the only signage is a neon burger outside.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />Burger Joint, Amoy Street, Singapore *\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #nomnomnom #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #burgers #goodeats #beef #buzzfeast #food #todiefor #burger #delicious #foodcoma #foodgram #eater #foodphotography #amazingfood #burpple #instagram #mychefstable #foodlover

oh, the bacon was too soft and tasted barely cooked. I prefer my bacon crispy, or at least not like it\'s almost raw? good for a first try but i will likely not want to queue (unless other friends want to try?) üòê
The sharp taste of the purple onions totally overwhelmed the delicate beef. Bun has integrity for the single patty, but disintegrated for the double it seemed.
Went to try this new franchise from NYC
Burger joint has landed in Singapore and tucked in an alley in CBD. This is a no-frills hamburger shop. Meaning don\'t expect gourmet burgers (they are anti-gourmet burger). Cheeseburgers from [S$11] onwards with customizable toppings of your choice. I\'ll only ever come back for the vanilla milkshake [S$11.80] but seriously ? I\'d rather go for happy hour.\n<br />Rating : üåùüåù\n<br />.\n<br />Burger Joint\n<br />115 Amoy Street\n<br />#03-01 (Enter by Gemmill Lane)\n<br />Tel: +65 6221 8648\n<br />.\n<br />Opening Hours:\n<br />Daily 11am to Midnight\n<br />.\n<br />#sgwanderlust #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgeats #igsg #sgig #burgerjoint #foodblogger #burpple
