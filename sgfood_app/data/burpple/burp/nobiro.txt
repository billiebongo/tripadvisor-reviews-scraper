If I am not wrong, we have the sea bream sashimi during my visit. The chef\'s marinade is light, yet flavourful but not overpowering. Allowing the clean and sweetness of the fish to shine.

I also did not really enjoy the soft texture of the pasta.
For the selection during our visit, the chef has given us the Amberjack, Sea Bream, Flounder, Sweet Shrimp, Squid and Fat Greening. The proportion of the rice to sashimi is thoughtfully executed for a balanced mouthful enjoyment to appreciate the freshness to the fullest.
If you are the type of person that cannot decides what to order, the simplest way is to go for their chef selection which comes in the form of 7, 12 and 15 sticks. We have the Chef Selection Set 7 Sticks ($23). This is perfect to go with a glass of beer or sake.
I probably ate half of it myself, instead of sharing with my three other dining companion. The flavourful marination of the squid, perfectly grilled over the fire for a hint of smokiness and tender texture has totally won me over.
The full flavoured beef is lighted seared on the exterior, sealing the juiciness in it for a explosive burst of flavour as it dissolved on the palate.
mix well and you\'re in for a treat.
The mixed sashimi and greens salad can be eaten on its own or wrapped with the nori for a fuller enjoyment.
My preferred way is to have it freshly shucked. The Nama Kaki Yonshiki ($20) is fresh oysters served in four different ways, with the topping of onion, salsa, hint of pesto and ponzu with pink salt. I do understand some people do not like the raw taste of oyster, so you can go for the Fried Nama Kaki ($15) or Mushi Nama Kaki ($20) which is fried and steamed fresh oysters.
