ðŸ”¹\n<br />This meal was so cheap it surprised me (if you compare it to Founders, Song Fa, Ng Ah Sio etc famous BKT shops) - merely SGD$20 for 2 of us - one pot of Pork Ribs BKT, one pot of Mixed BKT, one pot of Meatballs BKT, a rice, a youteow (fried doughstick), a taukee (braised beancurd skin). Eat Your Hearts Out.\n<br />ðŸ”¹\n<br />#food #foodie #foodsg #sgfood #foodblog #foodporn #foodgasm #foodgram #foodventure #foodnation #igfood #instafood #fooddiary #foodjournal #foodstagram #whati8today #claypot #bakkutteh #singaporefood #jiaklocal #meatball #foodjournal #thearcticstar #hongji #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burrple #foodspotting #delicious
This dark soup packed some really intense herbal fragrance for those who want a change from the familiar local white peppery version. Similar to its origin across the causeway, one could enjoy it with lots of ingredients on top of the tender pork ribs. \n<br />Do add on other similarly dark coloured side dishes, such as the beancurd skin, pork intestines, peanuts or braised pork trotter b\'cos they all just tasted so yummy. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #hawkersg #burpproved #bkt
