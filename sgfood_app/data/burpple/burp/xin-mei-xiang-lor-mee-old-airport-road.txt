Just made it in time.\n<br />Mine is the last few bowls, with only bee hoon and Kway teow as the choice of noodles left.\n<br />At first plan to visit Jogurtz but it\'s closed today. In the end decide to eat this since it looks good. The chunky fish meat tastes good, as well as, the gravy. |\n<br />Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong Lor Mee\n<br />Êñ∞ÁæéÈ¶ôÊ≠£ÂÆóÂç§Èù¢\n<br />Address : # 01-116 Old Airport Road Hawker Centre, Singapore 390019\n<br />Note : Closed on Thu\n<br />#PickatSG #Pickateer #YummyPin #8DaysEat #OpenRiceSG #InstaFood_SG #Burpple #SGIG #InstaSG #ExSGCafes #ExploreSingapore #TSLmakan #EatOutSG #PhotoMoolah #IGerSpotLight #SGFood #IGers #FoodPorn #Food #InstaFood #Singapore #SingaporeInsiders #SGFoodies #EatBookSG #WhereToEatSG #YelpSG
Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong Lor Mee ($4) has such a huge following that you literally have to wait patiently in line. However, very soon you will be rewarded with a bowl of goodies. Add a dash of black vinegar, some minced garlic and you are in for a treat. The sounds of slurping can be heard from afar as you slowly indulge, without any thought of sharing.\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />For more hawkerhopping, visit my profile and click on the link
