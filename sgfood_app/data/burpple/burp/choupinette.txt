French certainly know their eggs. Runny and soft, bursting at every bite, it\'s definitely a joy to wake up just to have their breakfast. || Price: S$21 (come in a brunch set meal of juice and coffee/tea) 
The food was quite good!! And really filling too~ The eggs were done real nicely😊 Forgot the names of what we ordered though:(
The vanilla ice cream has something extra I can\'t pinpoint... Maple syrup? Caramel? Either way it complemented the tart deliciously
Can taste the red wine, they didn\'t stinge on flavor 
Finally tried the highly raved Eggs Benedict from Choupinette. I liked it pretty much but it was a little too salty. Prefer Hatched\'s eggs benedict. Just my personal preference. Price range average. 
My thousand rainbow sprinkled Chou Chou from #choupinette. Sugary sweet stacked donuts for $3.90.
Superb eggs, cute furniture, but really lousy coffee. Meh. But their eggs were so good...! Will definitely be back for more 🍴
Post Promos dinner with dear @furreen- These Eggs Ben were AMAZING! The hollandaise sauce was superb. (The best I\'ve tried so far!) I really wanted to lick the plate clean mmhmmm!
Egg cooked with just the right texture! (Not too hard, not too soft).  Hollandaise sauce not too sour! (As i love it REALLY mild!) fresh ingredients! Plentiful of salmon, enough to nourish me with omega! At 23 sgd, its really value for money!

Simple dish. The cheese was yums. The beef patty was done perfectly. It was quite a boring dish though... I did hesitate before ordering, wondering if I would be content with this as a Sunday brunch.. Oh well, next time I\'ll order soemthing more exciting. If you like cheeseburgers, try this! 
Cosy nice little french cafe
Sick day, you need something warming and soothing. \n<br />#cafesg #sgcafes #foodiesg #sgfoods #igsg #sgig #instasg #instagramsg #instafoodsg  #sgfood #sgfoodporn #onthetable #ontheplate  #eatoutsg #burpple #burpplesg #healthyliving #healthymeal #healthylifestyle #fitness #fitnesslife #fitnessfreak #fitnessmotivation #fitnesslifestyle #fitnessfood #fitnessjourney #fitnessfirst #kathyscafehopping

Choupinette is one of the cozy cafe &amp; bakery that is non pretentious that carries a vibe of a French cafe at the district of Coronation Rd just right beside Coronation Plaza. They are known for their Egg Benedict &amp; Pastries. It\'s a place you can consider to dine for brunch on your weekends 😄
A jar of tiramisu? This is something able to cure your Monday blues. 😄

Quaint little cafe. Slightly pricey but food is not bad. Around 30+ per person with dessert. 
😋
Breakfast anyone? 😁
Great balance of flavours; crust could be better though!
