Almost impossible for us durian fans, here\'s to some Mao Shan Wang mousse cake! Expect to be smacked by a strong waft of fragrance as the cotton soft sponge sits atop layers of luxurious and creamy MSW durian mousse. Hurry before the Durian Fiesta ends on 17 July!
Price: $19.80\n<br />•\n<br />🚇: Orchard\n<br />•\n<br />Brace yourself! The durian season is here! Goodwood park has always set up a range of dessert for durian lovers to indulge in. Yes, I am aware of the recent case, but I still have my faith in them.\n<br />•\n<br />The outer layer of the power puff is crispy and slightly sweet. It gives a crunchy texture as you sink your teeth into the puff (something like Hong Kong polo bun).   The core of the puff is filled with durian. The durian tasted slightly sweet and you could still chew on pieces of the pulp. Even though I prefer my durian slightly bitter, I still enjoy it. \n<br />•\n<br />As for the price... It\'s a bit too \"steep\". I know it\'s Mao Shan Wang but the price was not justifiable. Oh! There is a 5% discount for DBS and POSB card holders
the annual durian festive season is back!! make sure to check this mouthwatering durian ICE CREAM CAKE out if you can! at $12, it might be costly but every cent is worth it. 😌
if it weren\'t for my ulcers, i would have moooooreeeee
Durian LOVE is in the air! These 3-inch ice cream bars are handmade with D24 durian pulp. Looking adorable and dainty, these are precious treats for those who love durians and ice cream. 
An eye-catching delight that\'s returning for a second year! Rainbow coloured sponge cake wrapped around D24 durian ice cream, it\'s so gorgeous that you\'ll pause before eating. However, I prefer it to have more durian pulp like the signature Durian Mousse Cake ($12).
Dark &amp; Pink Chocolate Ice cream bar with D24 durian pulp. \n<br />Durian Black Sea Salt Caramel Cake.
It\'s Durian Kueh Lapis! Part of the new D24 creations for 2016 at #GoodwoodParkHotel Layers of D24 Durian Mousse and almond sponge framed by Buttery and Spicey Kueh Lapis. Don\'t ask me how many calories this has. Eat first then exercise. $12 per slice / $62 for a whole cake.
So cute! These 3-inch treats are for durians and chocolate lovers. They are handmade with pure D24 durian pulp and comes in 6 flavours (one with only durian for purists). $6 per bar / $30 a box of 6 assorted flavours. Available from 4 Mar at the Deli at @GoodwoodParkHotelSG
Auspicious Blessings ($88++)\n<br />Earl grey butter cake, 1kg\n<br />Fashioned from earl grey butter cake and icing to the likeness of a mandarin orange carrier bag, this pretty creation was handmade by Pastry Chef Joe Tan and his team. Milk chocolate \'gold coins\' and a pair of handmade orange-chocolate \'mandarin oranges\' daintily propped on top, to symbolize blessings of wealth and good luck.\n<br />Thank you @GoodWoodParkHotelSG for gifting me with this cake on Valentine\'s Day. It simply looked too cute to be eaten.\n<br />|\n<br />Deli\n<br />Address 🏠 : 22 Scotts Road, Level 1 Goodwood Park Hotel Singapore, Singapore 🇸🇬 228221\n<br />Tel ☎️ : 6730 1786\n<br />Open 💈 : 9am-9pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Orchard (NS22/TE14)
Smokey, sweet, savoury, unctuous, tender, and ultimately satisfying. The squarish sheets of barbecued pork from @goodwoodparkhotelsg tick all the right boxes.
Resplendently glowing in gold is this scrumptious homemade chocolate marble cake Wealth of Opportunities cake that is handcrafted into the shape of a large garlic.

Marinated in a proprietary blend of spices, #GoodwoodParkHotelSG\'s sinful but shiok #BakKwa ($50 for 600g, $78 for 1kg) is one of the best things to look forward to for #CNY2016!
Can I just say that the traditional #Christmas #fruitcake from #GoodwoodParkHotelSG is damn moist and delicious? 👍😍\n<br />•\n<br />Got it just Tuesday, and we finished it today!
Okay, I know I\'ve said I\'ve had the best this and that and some of you may have gone and tried them and thought, wtf Rachel, what kind of crap is this that you\'re recommending?
Also on their #festive takeaway menu are extremely adorable D24 Durian Snowmen ($38 for a pair), and a new, oh-so divine Salted Caramel Tart ($36, 500g). All available starting 1 December at The Deli.
The smell is mindblowing. Super fragrant and the taste is rich. This is a must try for durian lovers! This is the real deal.
Famed for their durian, Goodwood park makes their tropical fruit mooncake series even fanciful with the introduction of this exotic blend.
The much raved about rainbow cake. In my humble opinion, the cake is too dry and ice cream too hard. Their durian macarons beat this fanciful rainbow cake hands down! 
first time trying this and it\'s so good. 😋 #WHPimperfections #whywhiteworks
It\'s the durian season again!!!! Durian rainbow ice cream (D24), durian cream puff (sold in pairs), durian crepe (D24), MSW Power puff and MSW horn for my own tea sesh back at home!! Cant wait to lay my hands on the macarons and chocolate wafer rolls as well. There\'s a 15% off dbs card for takeaways (but not applicable for MSW items and ice cream tubs!) 
This petite size dessert is no doubt beautiful looking, with rainbow sponge hugging a core of luscious durian ice cream embedded with D24 pulp. 😉
😋 back here again since I have been craving for it.
Hot &amp; sunny one moment, raining the next.
D24 Durian Cake at Goodwood Park Hotel, 2015! It\'s durian season. $50+ SGD
I 💕 macarons. So, how could I resist durian macarons? At $22.45 for 6 macarons, the price was a lil\' steep imo, hence, I was expecting more. The dark chocolate macaron shells had crisp exterior but lacked chewy interior. Can\'t really taste the chocolate too. However, the durian filling was creamy &amp; good.

How can I resist not buying the Durian Puffs (6 for $17.10)? Velvety smooth durian paste sandwiched between puff pastry sprinkled with \"snow\".
Guess who decided to drop by the office today to offer all staff a 20% discount on the pastries? How can I resist not buying the Durian Puffs (6 for $17.10)? Velvety smooth durian paste sandwiched between puff pastry sprinkled with \"snow\".
Omg i super love durian and all these certainly satisfy my cravings! Gotten the rainbow durian cake, puff &amp; crepe! Gonna get the macarons next time round after seeing @valeriehan \'s feeds 😋
This is pure durian bliss with an abundance of Mao Shan Wang durian pulp frozen in an ice cream tub to go at $24.40 (cones not included). Also comes in D24 version in the 16oz tub at $18 only. Simply can\'t get enough of these durian goodness.
Durian Cappuccino cake (L) makes its first comeback since 2011 featuring a stack of cappuccino mousse, durian mousse and chocolate sponge ensconced in yellow-gold crumbs of vanilla sponge.
If you love rainbow cakes and the goodness of durian, you will not say no to this innovative dessert. This is the best of all possible worlds, a luscious durian ice cream with D24 pulp encased in a trendy rainbow sponge cake ($11.75 each). 
A new take-away Lunar New Year goodie from the Deli - Goodwood Park Hotel presents the Golden Prosperity Pumpkin (Cashew Nut Cake $88/1kg) coated with gold icing makes a delicious gift for your friends and love ones. Available for takeaway from 29 January to 5 March 2015 at the Deli.

This gorgeous centrepiece features a crown of eye-catching ‘rocks’ made of\n<br />dark chocolate sponge cake and white chocolate ‘crisps’.  Read mire: http://www.misstamchiak.com/christmas-festive-treats-2014/
Generously coated with a nutty milk chocolate glaze and decorated with whole almonds and dainty dark chocolate squares. \n<br />This is one of my favorite festive cakes at Goodwood Park, and not forgetting the signature Durian Log Cake that promises lashings of creamy durian goodness within layers of vanilla sponge. Can you smell Christmas already.
A sweet takeaway Chocolate raspberry Push pop cake from Goodwood Park, so cute and nostalgic it reminds me of my childhood time. Misses.
This is the Steam baked turkey stuffed with a winning combination of freshly peeled whole chestnuts, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, carrots and spring onions. This delicious turkey is going at $198 serves 8 - 12 persons, perfect for a family gathering or corporate celebration.
Said to be limited edition with only 4000 pieces this year, this snowskin mooncake has probably gotta be one of the more pricey ones around ($80 for 4pcs excluding gst). Bittersweet durian encased in gold dusted black charcoal snowskin. Photogenic and good tasting but I\'m not too sure if I like this more than their usual mao Shan wang though. 
Midautumn festival doesn\'t feel complete without these babies 😍😍

We tried the gorgeous Durian Rainbow Ice Cream Cake ($11.20), Durian Crepe ($9.35) and Durian &amp; Black Sea Salt Caramel Cake ($12.15). Our favorite is the lattermost, where lusciously rich D24 durian is accompanied with sweet caramel and salty flavours from Hawaiian Black sea salt. #‎GWPDurianStyle #goodwoodpark #goodwoodparkdurianfiesta #sweettreat #sweettooth #prettydesserts #prettycakes #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #whatiate #whati8today #burpple #openricesg #eatoutsg #sgeats #instagramsg

Made with the premium D24 durian, Hawaiian black sea salt is used in the luscious cake, adding a feather-light savoury touches to the creamy sweetness. The dark dots on the top layer of the Durian Black Sea Salt Caramel Cake ($13 per slice/ $85 whole cake) are salt crystals.

They are so generous with their durian fillings. It tasted like real durian straight from the durian fruit. Some durian fillings are obviously mixed with only a minimal amount of original durian flesh, cream and maybe the durian purée? (Not sure, never make any before 😂) #burpple #burpplesg

How I love to call it, utopia country, was the best exchange option I had and I am glad I made the most of it in all of the senses. SG and its locals did a wonderful job by hosting me for 7 incredible months. Finally got the chance to understand more about Asia and break mental barriers and stereotypes. I will definitely be back and hopefully convince my friends and family to explore Singapore and rest of Asia. This is a local delicacy, called Durian Puff, to remark such an important moment. One of my favorite desserts that I had in really good company. SG, congrats! Keep on being awesome lah! #singapore #sg #SG50 #50 #durian #durianpuff #puff #goodwoodpark #foodie #burpple #ImissSGfood #dessert #shiok #asia #PGinAsia
