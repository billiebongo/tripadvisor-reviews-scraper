Ordered Pork cordon bleu($11.90) for myself and add on side dish of baked Italian meatballs &amp; potato gratin ($8.90) and calamari rings($6.50) to share with 2 of my friends.Don\'t miss out their desserts too! The lava cake is da bombüòâ
It is Really yummy And the price is Really affordable, this is worth the try.
Fancy some dessert after your dinner tonight? If you are sick of chocolate lava cake, why not try the Matcha Lava Cake with Vanilla Gelato from To-gather Cafe? At only $6.90 for the set, I have never come across a place that sells it cheaper than them.

Warm gooey chocolatey lava that goes so well with that creamy vanilla gelato.
Exceeded expectations! This was so delicious and the matcha taste was rich and satisfying :) super worth it for the price too and would definitely come back for this üçµüëç
Very yummy dessert- The chocolate was of good quality and the cake oozed nicely too! :) worth it for the price and goes perfectly with vanilla ice cream to complement it.
Similar to the meatball spaghetti, generous portion and worth it for the price. Found the spaghetti slightly plain after a while, though the sea food added flavour :) 
Very reasonable price and generous portion- yummy tomato sauce :) didn\'t like the meatballs that much but could be due to personal preference, I prefer beef meatballs and this one was pork  
Delicious Aglio Olio with generous seafood, right amount of spiciness! Lattes are alright. Seating is rather cramped though...
While I like to proclaim myself as a lover of cakes in all shapes, sizes, color, nationality, ethnicity and world peace, I am frankly a bit hesitant to cheesecake because of those weird berries that they top it with.
Love how value for money the food here is and the coziness of this place in the east. (Can you spy the spoon that can\'t wait to dig into the matcha lava cake!)
That oozing green lavaüòçüòçüòç I can\'t wait to have this again!!
Really cozy place serving up amazing pastas!!!  Clockwise from top left: spaghetti with meatballs (this is definitely not the actual name), the platter (ditto), teriyaki chicken pasta (ditto) and the seafood Aglio olio which is just AMAZING and blew my socks off. A little oily though, all the pastas, but it\'s definitely ok once in a while :-) this cafe is really popular with students, do come early to grab a good seat!
Huat ah fellow üêØ! üòÜ‚úåÔ∏è\n<br />Alright so this #latepost: Cheesy japanese curry baked rice for main at To-gather cafe, felt that the curry fragrance could have been stronger, quite lacking in e jap curry spice. Fresh prawns and well baked cheese are plus. My khakis and i were prob too starved, didn\'t feel full after e meal but that saved us some space for ice cream at Milk &amp; Honeyüç¶!
Big appetite often have small mouths. üëÑ\n<br />Back at To-gather together w ËÄÅ kakis. Anw i first misread the above quote as \'Big Chiongs often have small beginnings\' üòÖ
I tried their main course before I would say the pricing is really affordable by cafe standards but taste wise,it\'s just average.
A cosy ambience cafe serving pocket friendly meals. Prices are mainly below $10 nett. The food definitely surpass the price you paid for it. Generous serving of fresh veggies and crisp fries. Pandan flavor infused into the chicken thigh that is tender and juicy. And if you\'re there, do try their lava cake! I personally prefer the chocolate though compared to the matcha ones. 
Their most popular dessert in To-gather cafe. The rich chocolate comes with the vanilla ice cream, it s really nice.  
Usually I always happen to passby this cafe after my haircut. Seeing that many ppl come &amp; queue up to enjoy the meal in cafe. This Cafe sell many variety &amp; the price are nett price no svc &amp; gst. It is a reasonable price. @carl_holmberg @lesterho_net if u wanna go for cafe hopping come to this place. Name:Together Cafe. Address:Blk 84 Bedok North St 4 #01-25/27 Singapore 460084. Operating Hours:1100-2200hrs Sundays to Thuradays 1100-2300hrs Fridays &amp; Saturdays Closed on Mondays. The Cafe also open for reservation open to 4 to 5 days in advanced. Tel number:64451011.
The Cafe serve me Dark Lava Chocolate Cake &amp; Butterscotch Ice Cream. One of the reasonable price cafe along bedok neighbourhood area. Definitely will go back there Again.
Unique combination of cheese and Japanese sauce :D A really different taste from the usual baked rice. ;D
Was kinda disappointed initially as there was no molten chocolate oozing out from the lava cake and the vanilla gelato contain iced crystals (maybe due to the constant melting and freezing?). However, kudos to the service staff as they replaced it with a new set and the piping hot lava cake with gelato brings a sweet ending to my meal. 
A little sweet to end the day. Matcha lava cake was great, ice cream was bad. Having molten matcha flowing out from a cake is brilliant.
Treat yourself to some sweets after a bowl of Bak Chor Mee at Bedok 85 üçú Having a potluck party now, happy hols everyone! üôÜ
Good ambience that makes you want to stay in long. However when the crowd gets too busy the noise made by the students can get a little out of hand. But I\'m definitely going back again for more :-)
Very good vanilla ice-cream, flavorful and not too sweet. Drizzled with caramel sauce. Chocolate Lava Cake has a little milo taste, which is awesome for me. Would prefer if it is a little more warm and the lava would flow out like a river when cut open.
Crunchy. Can\'t see the meat but could taste it, a little too salty (perhaps it\'s the cheese and ham). Portion is pretty small. White sauce seems to be pasta cream sauce.
Black pepper, with saut√©ed sliced potatoes underneath the steak. Nice and tender, very worth it, considering the price.
Strong, full-bodied coffee. Right temperature and remained warm throughout the half hour that I took to finish it. A little lacking in the vanilla flavor though.
Light and refreshing. A little too sweet and slightly towards the bland side. Considering the price, it\'s quite a good catch.
Grilled Pandan Chicken Chop, coated with coconut sauce and pineapple salsa.\n<br />Warm Lava Cake with serving of vanilla ice cream.\n<br />A pot of Mogambo tea.
Mushroom soup was warming the tummy up for a good meal 
One of the main reasons why you should head down to To-gather Cafe and dine. The Chocolate Lava had only good reviews so far since I last searched about it. As you cut to take the first bite, the chocolate itself will be rushing out. It may be sinful but, you only live once yeah? I\'ve tried the one without the ice cream too but to me, it\'s best to eat without the ice cream. But it\'s all up to you. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
A must try dessert at To-gather Cafe. Both the hot and cold combination flows well together when you\'re eating it. No clashes at all. Too bad there\'s no just \"brownie with ice cream\". But still, it\'s worth it. üëç
A combination of prawn, salmon and squid (but for me, I ask to remove the squid cause I don\'t eat it.) It\'s a good different kind of Aglio Olio that I have eaten and definitely makes you coming back for more. A must to try at To-gather Cafe. 
This place is quite far from the Bedok interchange or MRT, so i would recommend to take bus to the fengshan area. Once i reached, it\'s located right at the back and next to a bird shop. Really hip eh? Haha the store looks amazing with the press to enter auto door. The prices werent so steep, quite average. And they have this cage wall where people hang their post-its. Bought the crispy chicken cube with thai sauce. It\'s just basically like popcorn chicken with some sauce on top on it. üò´ the quesadilla was not bad, but with the dip it tastes better. For three nuggets for $3.90(i think) wasnt so bad i guess. I\'d give this place a 5/10. Bonus points for the creative caged wall
Molten chocolate can be seen oozing out of the cake that is soft and spongy + homemade tiramisu  
Salmon was so nicely cooked that has a cream sauce spread all over the fish. Mashed potato was one of the best side ever 
Thumbs Up! I had the main course salmon fillet before this and would say, there\'s always another stomach for this lava cake cos it\'s THAT nice.
Relatively cheap and good food for a cafe! Big breakfast/Main courses were not more than $10.
Tried passionfruit breeezer and earl grey mousse cake!! Verdict: Can try :)
The first bite wasn\'t fantastic but as you eat, it\'s quite nice and addictive.
Special order from To-gather Cafe. Pink pasta taste like heaven.
Trying the popular heartland cafe.. pretty small place and heard they are expanding to nxt door... pretty cool and cosy cafe. Crowded!
Don\'t like fried food but I\'m a sucker for the stuffed ham and cheese.
Spot the nice half white latte art
$8.90. Tiny chunks of salmon, squid, prawns. Not the typical garlicky kind of aglio olio but it was tasty. Wished the portion was bigger haha.
$8.90. Crispy, but tartar sauce was meh.
Meat ball spaghetti  üôÜüôÜüôÜfreaking good ambience and the food is super nice , worth giving it a try üëç
Really nice and appetizing! Got it at student\'s price and the atmosphere of the cafe is really good :) best to visit during off-peak hours-
A cosy spot under a Bedok HDB flat suitable for young families and groups of friends, To-gather Cafe truly is a place to gather. With really reasonable prices, you can get Chocolate Lava cake ($3.80) and a coffee, or a dinner of tasty Grilled Pandan Chicken Chop ($8.90). Along with great ambience and service, there\'s no reason you shouldn\'t drop by this lovely cafe if you live nearby. Photo by Elaine Koh
a weekend special ! lovely and subtle, doesn\'t feel too sinful as it is not overly sweet. a smaller portion than the standard in most cafes but the price is proportionately lower. 
pretty good Japanese style onion sesame dressing and generous w the ingredients (choice of seafood or chicken)
overly salty (and this coming from me, the one who is into salt and MSG)
Surprising find in the heartlands, with reasonable prices (no service charge and GST is already built into their prices)
Served warm (you can order it a la mode if you wish), it was alright but nothing too overwhelming 
Reasonably priced lava cake with oozing core of chocolate, perfect when paired with vanilla ice cream and the accompanying caramel sauce. Not the best, but certainly more than worth it for the price 
Filling and pretty yummy! Cheese and Japanese curry and even seafood inside--who knew they could all get along...
The salmon is really fresh and delicious, and it matches the mash potatoes perfectly!
$5.90. Grilled chicken slices, cheese, tomato salsa dip
Nice small cozy place (near Bedok 85!) with communal table and individual seating. Suitable for family too (I think they\'ve got kids\' play area for them to run wild so it wasn\'t exactly quiet when I was there). Food\'s affordable, quite worth it imo.
$16.90, tender! Quite liked it although they served us one that looked more rare than medium rare. Served with mushroom ragout and vegetables.
Always order cordon bleu (but usually chicken!) whenever I see one and more often disappointed than not but this wasn\'t that bad at $10.90. At least I enjoyed it haha (ANYONE KNOWS ANYWHERE WITH GOOD CORDON BLEU??) Anw it was crispy, meat relatively moist, not too tough, stuffed w usual ham and cheese. Served with fries and salad.
$4! Probably the thing I liked the least out of everything we ordered! Idk what I was expecting but this tasted like chocolate milk hahaha
Decent piece of ribeye at S$16.90. The outside seating is uncomfortable. You seriously cannot have a private conversation because there\'s absolutely no space between the next table. One can have equal piece of steak at similar price in a western stall of a hawker centre. A little more privacy than here and you have the option of other food if one so wish. 
For S$10.90, it\'s alright. There\'s sufficient cheese and it does ooze out with every cut. The sauce however is tasteless.  
A dish with combinations unexpected but turned out really nice with the chicken marinated appropriately to suit the coconut taste of the pandan sauce,
Cosy hidden gem cafe at neighborhood area. Food are pretty yummy with affordable price and with no gst and service charge.
Juicy n tender thigh meat however I feel that the rosemary taste is too strong for me... Overall is still pretty good 
Tasted like the chef bought frozen goods and fried it way before it was ordered.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodblog #foodlover #foodstagram #instafood #sgfoodie #igsg #sgfoodblog #foodiegram #instadaily #igers #whati8today #burpple #EATPL

Love their ice cafe latte!
Despite not being able to taste a very strong flavour of hojicha in both, the saving grace is that this is still a dessert if you want something light. Word of caution: don\'t expect too much on the thick hojicha shot.\n<br />#food #foodphotography #foodstagram #desserts #sweets #swissroll #hojicha #cafehoppingsg #togathercafe #stfoodtrending #burpple #foreverhungry

Like the ambience and affordable food platter. Not pretentious but great menu.
not exactly picturesque like the one in sync Korean food bistro.. but still alright for the price? haha

A combination of Hot and Cold, and contrast between sweet and bitterness. I love the interesting texture contrast between the smooth and creamy texture (of the coffee and ice-cream) topped with the crunch from the cornflakes. I will be back for this again! I promise! \n<br />#sgcafe #together #shermtaste #iapprove #enjoythefinerthingsinlife #openricesg #nomnomsg #burpple \n<br />I need this on my table NOW!
I love the strong tea flavor of the mousse which was enhanced by the tea jelly that was intelligently added into the dessert to create bouts of tea explosion in the mouth when u bite into it. I should have just dabao-ed some back to hall for supper tonight. üòãüòãüòãüòã #sgfood #cake #mousse #earlgrey #dessert #sgcafe #sgfood #cafehop #nomnomsg #openricesg #burpple #enjoythefinerthingsinlife #iapprove #shermtaste #together #togethercafesg
