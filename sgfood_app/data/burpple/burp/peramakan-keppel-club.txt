(Almost) everything here is 5/5 burps. Bagusssss! 
(Absolutely no words needed) 5/5 burps 
To deserve such a beautiful nonya platter with a candle to wish upon. Although not technically a birthday cake, these rare pancake treats made with rice flour and fermented coconut water and dunked in a thick banana and palm sugar caramel is just as indulging and well celebrated. Thanks to the \'buncit\' of a @mousegal for this memorable Apam Berkuah \"cake\". | #appam #pancake #coconut #birthday #cake #candle #alfmsingapore #food #sgfoodie #sgfood #dessert #foodvsco #vscocam #vscofood #travel
We pointed our fingers at every item on the menu and ordered them. Obviously we were too ambitious (as always) but who can fault this spice-deprived man from trying to satisfy his cravings? These were only just the \"starters\" | #food #onthetable #foodie #sgfoodie #sgfood #peranakancuisine #foodpic #foodporn #vscocam #vscofood #alfmsingapore #travel
