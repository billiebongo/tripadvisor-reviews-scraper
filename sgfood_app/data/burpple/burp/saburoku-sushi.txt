This was a bittersweet thing. Why? Because as fabulous as this incredibly fresh uni and ikura mini rice bowl was, it also signaled the end of our meal. Hence, as much as I looked forward to inhaling this, I simultaneously mourned the stop to the parade of marvelous sushi.
Really happy to have eaten it this month! Shinko, aka baby kohada/gizard shad, is only available in the month of July till mid August. It\'s really difficult to prepare this sushi. The fish is only 5cm long and you have to fillet it carefully, then it has to be cured in vinegar to clean it up. 3-4 pieces of this fish is used to form the sushi. It\'s a real test for any sushi Chef. Very thankful to Chef Koji for preparing this sushi expertly! A slight hint of vinegar to cut through the oiliness of the fish. Shall wait patiently till next year now! lol
Every single scale must be removed and due to its size, you need quite a number of the fillets to make a single piece of nigiri. I had six on my piece. This is one labour intensive and delicate piece of neta and hence, you can see why it\'s prized and sought after. Chef Koji, thank you so much for saving these few pieces for us. We are indeed much blessed. Arigatou gozaimasu!
Here they are laid out like a fan, waiting to be made into two pieces of nigiri.
I have been wanting to try them ever since I heard that Chef Koji served them. We were already slightly late in the season and Chef Koji was kind enough to save some for us.
I love eggs and so this is always comfort food for me.
Someone once told me that true sushi lovers appreciate a good akami zuke more than otoro and chutoro.
I love Japanese pickles and I know they are meant to be palate cleansers but if you place them in front of me, I can just go on and on.
This was a nice surprise as you don\'t often find fried items in sushiyas. I love how sweet the Shiro Ebi was and didn\'t even need the salt for flavour.
The hotate was so large that it covered the whole shari. Really sweet and good! I enjoyed this piece very much.
Chef Koji told us that this was wild caught from Hachijojima, one of the islands near Tokyo. This was really good and mackerel lovers would love this.
Dessert was made of chestnuts from Kyoto and served with slices of persimmon from Nara. The dessert was made by a friend of Chef @kojikoike1118‚Äôs. I liked how it tasted, subtle and not too sweet.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It was prepared tataki style which is when food is seared quickly on the outside and left raw inside. Yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
We make it a point to visit our favourite sushiyas once every season. The idea is to be able to sample the season‚Äôs best. It is fascinating to see how even a simple dish like chawanmushi would be different every season. On this occasion, we had ours with matsutake mushroom üòç!\n<br />*\n<br />Matsutake mushroom, harvested during autumn, is dubbed the King of Mushrooms and rightly so. Sweet and more intense compared to other mushrooms.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Gem in CBD!
This was probably my fav piece yesterday as grilling it slightly just released the fish oil which was so amazingly good and with a touch of salt, no words can describe how good it was. I want more!
ü§§
It was a completely different experience and it tasted a little like cold custard. It went really well with the white corn from Hokkaido. While I enjoyed it, I think I still prefer my chawanmushi hot.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The first thing we asked Chef @kojikoike1118 was whether he had nodoguro. When he said that it was not part of our set, we immediately requested an additional order.\n<br />*\n<br />When Chef Koji saw us taking a picture of the tray, he put the perfectly aburi-ed nodoguro right in front of us üòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was served instead of the nodoguro (blackthroat seaperch) we had the last time around. Chef @kojikoike1118\'s aburi sushi are very well executed. I love them and this was no exception. Oishii!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
@blueskiescottonclouds and I were delighted that @kojikoike1118 could accommodate our request. This was super delicious. The best I\'ve had. So oily and strong tasting üòçüòçüòç.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I have to admit that I was initially disappointed that we weren\'t served the ebi kakiage (shrimp and vegetable tempura) which was so good I was looking forward to it.\n<br />*\n<br />The braised buri was equally if not more delicious that the disappointment became a new high üòä. The sauce was so tasty that @blueskiescottonclouds and I asked for rice to mop it up!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I would normally be absolutely satisfied with a good chutoro (semi fatty tuna) but I also can\'t resist a good otoro, especially when it is aged well. This was sublime!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Lunch was so good and worth it that @blueskiescottonclouds and I were back with a party of 8. It would have been 10 but the whole sushiya was already booked out.\n<br />*\n<br />As with most sushiyas, fish served is seasonal and we had amadai (tilefish, part of the sea bream family) to start the sushi course with.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
One of the better ones I\'ve had.\n<br />*\n<br />This was truly a very satisfying lunch. We will definitely be back and I think quite soon as well.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was cooked really well. Delicious!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodies_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
With one single piece of shinko (baby gizzard shad) left, Chef Koji-san (@kojikoike1118) made it into a mini sushi as a surprise for @blueskiescottonclouds üòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I am allergic to ikura (salmon roe) so I was given toro instead üòçüòçüòç. First time feeling lucky due to my allergy üòÇ. Needless to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my rice bowl.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was the sole reason why @blueskiescottonclouds and I rushed over for lunch as soon as we could. We wanted to try this before the season ended. Otherwise we would be eating full sized kohada (gizzard shad) üòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I find akami taste better when marinated.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I always enjoy finding out what\'s inside. In this case, it was served with a very yummy piece of kani (crab).\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Served as aburi (seared). Another round of \'oohs and aahs\' when we saw this. This was amongst the best nodoguro I\'ve had üòçüòç. @blueskiescottonclouds wanted another one but I was, as usual, the voice of reason. We still had more to dishes to come.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
@blueskiescottonclouds was so thrilled to be served this! They were so small yet so sweet üòã.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was very light, crispy and tasty. We were so happy to be served such good kakiage üòç.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Gari (ginger), daikon (radish) and serori (celery). These are supposed to be palate cleansers but they tasted soo good that we had to be given second helpings of gari.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I love oily fish and was therefore thrilled to be served saba. It tasted even better when marinated with salt and vinegar üòã.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
From a larger than 200kg tuna. Just the right amount of tuna fat - truly oishii üòçüòç!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Much bigger than the ones you would normally get. So large that it covered the rice! Naturally sweet and delicious üòã!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
With added salt and lime zest, the ika which is naturally sweet had a tinge of salt and zest.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Wild (not farmed) from the waters close to Hachijo Islands, south of Tokyo. The texture is delightfully more firm and smooth.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This sushiya, recently opened six months ago, is such a gem of a find. Thanks to a very mouthwatering post by @abbeycmh, @blueskiescottonclouds and I wasted no time at all in making our way over for lunch.\n<br />*\n<br />It is helmed by Chef Koji-san (@kojikoike1118), previously of Tamaya Dining. He serves traditional edomae sushi with extremely good quality fish.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_saburoku #saburoku #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Chef Koji, thanks for having us and thank you for the shinko! We look forward to our next visit soon. Arigatou gozaimasu!
Yummy!
Briny ikura pearls and creamy Uni are indeed a match made in heaven!
This was really the best piece of Nodoguro I\'ve eaten so far. So good that I almost asked for a second piece.
So happy when Chef Koji served us this.
We enjoyed this piece too!
This beauty came from a 200kg tuna. Yummy!
So sweet and delicious!
I enjoyed it and I was happy that I had a good fill of greens for lunch.
