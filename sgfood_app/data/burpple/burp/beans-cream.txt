Yay! How convenient to satisfy the family’s ice cream/waffle cravings 😬 The flavours we got are cookies n cream, pulut hitam &amp; earl grey (L-R). Earl grey was THE BEST.

Love this #thaiiceteaicecream with #waffles at #beansncreamsg ! Not too sweet &amp;  got that distinctive bitterness of red tea! Absolutely digged into it!  Lol
Really one of the best matcha ic everrrrrr 😋🍦😋
The avocado tasted nice but cnbe stronger while the dark chocolate is really \"dark\". Hahaha! \n<br />#burpple #beansncreamsg #waffle #icecream #avocadoicecream#darkchocolateiccream #cafesg
This is root beer float for the adult! Sweetness from the vanilla ice cream and bitterness from the espresso. Beauty &amp; the Beast! Lol \n<br />#burpple #beansncreamsg #icecream #espresso #affogato #hdbcafe

I love mocha!! No doubts about it! And at only $4 Singapore dollars, This is without doubts one of the best mocha at this price! \n<br />#‎cafehoppingsg‬ ‪#‎cafehopping‬ ‪#‎cafesg‬ ‪#‎sgcafe‬ ‪#‎cafeculture‬ ‪#‎cafe‬ ‪#‎singapore‬ ‪#‎sgfood‬ ‪#‎sgfoodies‬ ‪#‎coffee‬‬ ‪#‎foodie‬ ‪#‎foodporn‬ ‪‪#‎mocha‬ ‪#‎foodstagram‬ #burpple #beansandicecream #bukitbatok
Double scopes for me! One Mao Shan Wang and the other is Hazelnut! Both are listed as premium ice creams there. Both are not very sweet like most of the ice cream at other place and doesn\'t have the overwhelming milk taste to it. To other it may seems rather \"bland\" but I find it to be just alright for my taste bud. \n<br />#‎cafehoppingsg‬ ‪#‎cafehopping‬ ‪#‎cafesg‬ ‪#‎sgcafe‬ ‪#‎cafeculture‬ ‪#‎cafe‬ ‪#‎singapore‬ ‪#‎sgfood‬ ‪#‎sgfoodies‬ ‬ ‪#‎foodie‬ ‪#‎foodporn‬ ‪#‎icecream #handmade #handmadeicecream #durianicecream #maoshanwangicecream #hazelnuticecream ‪#‎foodstagram‬ #waffle #wafflewithicecream #burrple #beansandicecream #bukitbatok
Didn\'t really planned to visit this little new place. Happened to in the area thus decided to drop in and have a little snack. #‎cafehoppingsg‬ ‪#‎cafehopping‬ ‪#‎cafesg‬ ‪#‎sgcafe‬ ‪#‎cafeculture‬ ‪#‎cafe‬ ‪#‎singapore‬ ‪#‎sgfood‬ ‪#‎sgfoodies‬ ‪#‎coffee‬ ‪#‎latte‬ ‪#mocha #‎foodie‬ ‪#‎foodporn‬ ‪#‎icecream‬ #handmade #handmadeicecream #waffle #durianicecream ‪#‎mocha‬ ‪#‎foodstagram‬ #burrple #beansandicecream #bukitbatok

Higy reccomend the very velvety rich dark chocolate 😍
So many flavor to choose from and I do not know which one to get so I ended up getting the matcha one. $6.90 for this. 
More competitive pricing then uders
Reasonably priced for a small cafe at $4 , I like how it tasted as well!
Crispy waffles, mega love! Ft. Rum&amp;raisin as well as matcha green tea flavored ice cream; homemade goodness.
