Well, I don\'t. The pig trotters is good though. And my takeaway 凉拌！👍🏻
This is 1 big bowl of #unami goodness! 😻 .
The bowl is filled with all the good stuffs, and the broth is so awesome, I love the yummy mushroom pork-balls!

Heard so much about this stall. Finally got to tried it today after patiently waiting for about 45 minutes. Seafood soup comprises of cray fish, prawns, pomfret slices, minced pork and a delicious stock......just that soup was too little. Note: no refilling of soup. I also tried the pig\'s trotter but find that it\'s too hard, not to my liking. My personal opinion the soup is really good! Apart from that I am not crazy about the rest. Cray fish, prawns were slightly over cooked that it\'s dried. Verdict: 3/5
