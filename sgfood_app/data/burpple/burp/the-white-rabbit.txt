It was my first time coming to The Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar and I must say I am not disappointed one bit. 
Our Sunday brunch didn\'t just end on a high note, it ended with a chorus.\n<br />Here are the desserts we had, and mind you, everything is made in-house (clockwise from top):\n<br />1. The Mixed Berries Pavlova with Berry Sorbet: Why I recommend the one here to everyone who asks me about desserts at Dempsey Cookhouse &amp; Bar is because of its level-headed sweetness. The medley of textures, and the sweet and sour from the tart sorbet, crunchy meringue dome with a cottony-soft heart, fresh fruit plus whipped cream never fails to put a smile on a face.\n<br />2. Coconut Ice-cream: Intense in flavour, incredibly smooth and thick, this hot favourite was shoveled up in no time.\n<br />3. Salted Caramel Ice-cream Sundae: Of the spread, it was the sweetest but I do adore their housemade rich ice-cream that\'s so intense in flavour. The bonus is having it with the dark chocolate fudge and very fresh, crunchy popcorn and peanut clusters. No wonder this is the restaurant\'s Executive Sous Chef Dwayne\'s go-to when he needs a pick-me-up after a particularly long day. \n<br />4. Almond Cake: Available only in the daytime, the fragrance of almonds reaches you from afar. It reminded me of a sugee cake but slightly less buttery. I especially liked the tiny slivers of almonds buried throughout. \n<br />5. Pear Sorbet: The fullness of this has made customers double-check with staff if it really is a sorbet - a positive thing in my opinion, as they obviously found it creamy. And because actual fruit is used in the making, there\'s a slightly sandy texture to this. I can\'t recall the last time I had a pear-flavoured anything, which is why I reckon it\'s worth giving this unusual sorbet a try.
I seem to be coming across some really excellent burgers of late. First there was South Union Park\'s massive creation, then there were the few amazing winners by Three Buns at Potato Head Folk and today, this truffle-icious dreamboat appeared. It is the only burger on the menu here, so you won\'t miss it.\n<br />Can I start by raving about those buns? While eating, I could literally smell the smokiness from their time on the grill and trust me, that added a lot to my dining pleasure. Draped with a big slice of melted cheese, the beef patty was thick, juicy and cooked to a perfect pink within. I was very pleased that when I cut my burger in half, there was no icky blood trickling from the patty (don\'t you just hate it when that happens?). Anyway, this showed that the patty was beautifully-cooked and properly rested before being assembled. Unlike the others mentioned above, this burger had lettuce in it. Now, that is usually a no-no in my books because I\'ve been traumatised by soggy buns due to wet lettuce being shoved in. However, the one here was dry (save for the truffle sauce which I\'ll talk about in a moment) and crisp. And that made all the difference. Now, for that truffle sauce. It\'s the creamy type and has a strong truffle flavour which you\'d surely adore if you are a truffle-lover. I found the thin slices of pickles a brilliant addition as they helped to balance the overall richness with a tangy crunch.
\"The prawn salad is Fiona\'s favourite,\" explained Executive Sous Chef Dwayne Muang on why he had sent it to our table. This conversation took place post-meal when we\'d already inhaled it. Well, his words simply reinforced my belief that our mutual friend (who happens to be a Burpple Tastemaker) has excellent taste. \n<br />Now, about the salad.\n<br />It\'s intriguing enough that the flavourful dressing has the word \"champagne\" in it but it also departs from the norm by boasting a slightly sweet richness which I reckon, is key to why the salad tastes terrific. But let\'s not forget to give each element due credit too. We had prawns that\'re really fresh and sweet while the mixed greens that\'d been prettied up with tiny flowers, were perky and crisp. Lending its inimitable fattiness to round things off was half an avocado.\n<br />I recommend ordering this if you\'re seeking something healthy but are a bit tired of the usual.\n<br />.
That being said, this black truffle + fontina cheese pizza was good...strong flavours with great depth from the truffle\'s earthiness and the cheese\'s subtle sweetness. The base had a decent crustiness which many would appreciate.
The most delectable sweet ending to our meal last night. Macerated mixed berries with a crisp meringue shell encasing even more fluffy marshmallow-textured meringue, balancing a sweet strawberry sorbet. Just the right dessert, light and refreshing to end off our meal. 
Kicked off last night\'s meal with this beauty. In all her glory. Sweet confit of fragrant Meyer Lemons sitting proudly atop creamy Burrata curds, showered generously with crushed black pepper and some good quality olive oil. Served alongside a couple of toasted sourdough slices. Simple yet tantalizing 💛\n<br />18bucks/serve\n<br />#FTrecommends
The calamari was perfect: light, crunchy and grease-free, with no rubberiness whatsoever. That yuzu foam dip however, was insane! I just wanted to dive right in. And those slices of pickled green chillies? *Swoon*
Soft and fluffy, with crispy charred bits, and extremely thin; you could eat more of the pizza without being filled up by the crust. The best part about this is that I taste both the truffle and the cheese without being overwhelmed by the fumes of truffle oil from the next table or mine. I abhor the stench of truffle oil but I had to give this a go, given that it\'s a signature dish. I am glad it did not disappoint. I would definitely order this again in a heartbeat. #burpple #dempseycookhouseandbar
Today\'s the start of weekend brunch at Dempsey Cookhouse &amp; Bar and I made sure to be there as my previous dining experiences were nothing short of unforgettable.\n<br />It\'s terribly difficult to find pavlovas in Singapore due to the challenges of making one in our crazy humidity, so I was really happy when I spotted the Mixed Berries Pavlova with Berry Sorbet in their menu. \n<br />The meringue was as light as air, boasting a shell that\'s thin and wonderfully crisp plus an interior where marshmallowy puffiness ruled. I love that its sweetness was just right, not the teeth-achingly sort of others I\'ve had.\n<br />Furthermore, the refreshing sorbet, gently tart berries and light chantilly cream piped beneath, helped to round off the entire taste profile beautifully.\n<br />The result is a thoughtfully crafted, well-balanced,  dessert that I\'m sure anyone can squeeze in even after a very filling meal.
Here\'s proof that it pays to listen to recommendations by the staff. It was the manager who told me about this sandwich, which happens to be a favourite of his.\n<br />In terms of presentation, it\'s decent but the taste was what made me literally sit up.\n<br />Let\'s start with the sesame seed buns - they\'re super light and nicely toasted, so there\'s zero stodginess. Between them were a few pieces of chicken breast that were wonderfully moist and tender. The genius touch though was the spicy dressing, lime pickles and crisp onions. We had lift-off with their triple threat of flavour, heat and zing. And yet, the spiciness stayed at a very manageable level and never burned.\n<br />In my eagerness to inhale the sandwich, decorum was forgotten and my hands got involved. \n<br />#pleasedontjudge
This piece of prettiness won\'t weigh you down as it\'s on the petite side but it\'ll surely delight you with a medley of flavours.\n<br />Composed of three eggs (do ask for them to be cooked runnier if that\'s your preference), asparagus, smoked bacon, crunchy croutons, red chilli and fresh dill, this is ideal for those who like their eggs boldly pimped up.
New lifestyle space Como Dempsey is now home to renowned Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten\'s first restaurant in Asia. In the day, The Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar is a picture-perfect dream — think white rattan chairs with intricate back details fitted around white marble tables, coupled with a lush greenery overhanging from the bar in the centre of the restaurant. At night, the space transforms into a cosy restaurant with mellow lighting — great for intimate date nights. For best value, we recommend skipping the Egg Caviar ($35) and spending your money on the Foie Gras Brulee ($19) instead. Expect a generous portion of goose liver cooked to perfection, and served with lychee and black olives for a fun mix of sweet and salty. Also try the Chef\'s specialty, Black Truffle and Fontina Cheese Pizza ($20), cooked in a cherry wood oven. Smothered generously with black truffle paste from France and topped with black truffle shavings, the crisp and light pizza is also sprinkled with fontina cheese to give it \"a touch of creamy saltiness\", according to Burppler Veronica Phua. She also loves how the small pile of frisee in the middle helps to cut through the richness. \n<br />Avg Price: $50 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Veronica Phua
I couldn\'t agree more with Wong Ah Yoke\'s Sunday Times\' review of their Salted Caramel Ice-cream Sundae ($14). \n<br />In this decadent dream, it\'s really the trimmings that propel the three big scoops of ice-cream into super guilt-dom (not that I care). Honestly, who in the right mind will say no to the uber thick chocolate fudge, and crunchy caramel clusters of popcorn and peanuts? 😋
By recommendation of the staff, we had the ice cream sundae which came generously with three scoops of salted caramel ice cream — so thick, rich and definitely 100% salted caramel! Hot fudge is drenched over the side with some caramelized crunchy popcorn and nuts. This is definitely a sinful treat and best shared amongst 3-4 people.
For our mains, we chose the roasted rod as it came with an Asian touch — the green curry. The green curry tasted very legit with flavors of the spices and some heat in it. The cod was buttery and well cooked, though I thought the presentation could be improved. Those tender vegetables on the plate — squash and asparagus, played a good role with its gentle and sweet flavors.
The lobster was served with a layer of gewurztraminer (white wine) foam on top and working on the dish through the foam would unveil the plump pieces of lobster meat. The lobster meat was firm with a strong sweet crustacean taste which is a testament to the quality and freshness of the lobster. It is drenched with a saffron tapioca sauce and those little sago pearls were delightful! The sauce tasted somewhat like a light lobster bisque which complemented those lobster meat very well.
One of Chef Jean Georges’ signature dishes — the black truffle and fontina cheese is a must try at The Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar. It was a beautiful collaboration between those generous amount of sexy black truffles interlaced with some buttery nutty fontina cheese. I appreciated the thin pizza base with a crispy crust which went well with the heavy tasting toppings.
We started our meal with the Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons that was gracefully sliced into long thin strips and rolled up into a rose shaped structure.
In contrast to the tuna, the foie gras brulee was on the rich and creamy side. It came with a smooth foie gras pate atop a thin layer of bread, topped with sour cherry, pistachio and white port gelee. I loved the richness of the pate as it melts on my tongue, while the nutty pistachio and tangy white port gelee comes in to balance it out perfectly.
Of course I had to order this signature of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. And it was everything I hoped it would be.\n<br />The crisp and light crust was the result of time spent in the cherry wood-fired oven. And smothered over it was a generous amount of black truffle from France. Not only in paste form but shaved as well. The fontina cheese was perfect in its supporting role as it added a touch of creamy saltiness. I also liked the small pile of frisée in the middle - it helped to cut the richness beautifully.\n<br />What surprised me most about this dish though was the lower-than-expected price point. Two slices are filling so I recommended ordering this to share.
For me, the most interesting dish of the night was the foie gras. And it also happens to be the one I liked best.\n<br />Not only was the goose liver of a good size but it was beautifully cooked. What fascinated me though was the pairing of it with lychees and black olives. The sweet and salty mix was surprising and brilliant. There\'s also a rose element which I suspect, was what the pile of silky \"powder\" was. The scent must have been faint but that didn\'t detract one bit from my enjoyment.\n<br />Even the slender piece of toast placed alongside the foie gras played an important role: using its neutrality to bring all the stronger-tasting components together.\n<br />This is a must-try in my opinion. 
Ironically, the smallest item at last Friday\'s dinner happened to be the most expensive. But the Egg Caviar had a luxurious mouthfeel and tasted exquisite, so it did make me smile.\n<br />Under the pile of caviar (which klutzy me found tricky to eat without triggering a mini avalanche) was a warm, foamy egg sabayon. It really was an ideal base to the slippery crunch of the caviar\'s oceanic brightness.

Not the cod fish but the amazing broth created \n<br />In fact all the sauces I had for the night were delicious. Praises to the saucier here

Light and yummy! Chefs, thanks for this sweet treat.
Kids absolutely loved this sundae.
One bite and I can see why. Juicy patties, done just right, topped with Brie and black truffle, this was delicious. What Sunday brunches are made of.
I love this finely chopped kale salad dressed with a lemon dressing, tossed with green chillies and mint. Really refreshing and good!
We saw many orders of the cheeseburger go out to other tables - it must be good ... and it was! The beef patty was very tasty. Brie and truffle are two of my favourite ingredients so the combination obviously worked really well for me!\n<br />*\n<br />It was also very thoughtful of the kitchen to cut the burger into four for us. Thank you.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_dempseycookhouseandbar #dempseycookhouseandbar #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I am glad @blueskiescottonclouds ordered this. It was a very light and refreshing change to the heavy pasta and pizza. I like how the kale was shredded into small pieces, with breadcrumbs added for crunch.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_dempseycookhouseandbar #dempseycookhouseandbar #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
A very light and creamy burrata which tasted even better when eaten with the Meyer lemon jam 😋.\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you chefs for sending this our way.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_dempseycookhouseandbar #dempseycookhouseandbar #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The calamari was tasty but I found the batter to be a little soggy and not crispy enough. Otherwise this would have been yummy, especially with the yuzu dip.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_dempseycookhouseandbar #dempseycookhouseandbar #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was my favourite of the dishes we ordered. The rigatoni was al dente and the meatballs especially tasty. I loved how the sauce was very flavourful with just a slight hint of chilli. Definitely a must order!\n<br />*\n<br />Thanks @blueskiescottonclouds for ordering this dish.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_dempseycookhouseandbar #dempseycookhouseandbar #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It was crispy around the edges yet soft and cheesy in the centre. There was also plenty of umami truffle. So so delicious!\n<br />*\n<br />A great recommendation by @veronicaphua.

Truffle and cheese.. Life is good
Peach pavlova with olive oil ice cream and ginger. This was very light and not too sweet. My kind of dessert 😂.\n<br />*\n<br />Salted caramel ice cream sundae with popcorn, peanuts and hot fudge. Although I do not like my desserts sweet, this had to be an exception as I absolutely love salted caramel!\n<br />*\n<br />Strawberry basil panna cotta. I have to say that this dessert surprised me. The panna cotta was very light and not too sweet - again my type of dessert - but that wasn\'t the surprise. It was really the subtle hint of Thai basil which made the dish stand out. Thanks chefs for this treat too.\n<br />*\n<br />I really couldn\'t choose a favourite amongst the three. All of them were good 😋.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_dempseycookhouseandbar #dempseycookhouseandbar #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Ok, that\'s all.
Besides their truffle pizza (my 2nd visit and still loving it), this is another dish you must order here. It was divine! 😌\n<br />I wished i captured clearer how stunning the egg yolks underneath were. 😍\n<br />#toastedeggyolk #caviar #oscietracaviar #thedempseycookhouseandbar #jeangeorges #eggcaviar #eggporn #egglover #sgfoodie #sgphotography #burpple #city_noms #topcitybites #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #instafood_sg #instafoodie #sgphotography #exploreflavours #stfoodtrending #singaporeliciouz

I have eaten burrata countless times but having it with lemon preserves was a first. No complaints though - its zingy counterpoint to the creaminess of the cheese was spot on.\n<br />Special mention must be made of those slices of toast too. They\'re so good I\'m quite sure I\'d be able to polish off a whole basket.
It\'s so rare that I am happy with almost everything that comes to the table. More on the food soon. #burpple #dempseycookhouseandbar
