Aesthetically pleasing and the flavors of their perfectly toasted croissant with the soft shell crab and Mac &amp;a cheese just creates a harmonious symphony on your palate. 😍 and not forgetting that home cured smoked salmon - my all time favorite. If there\'s any where you\'ve to go this weekend for brunch, it has got to be PADDY HILLS 😍

The food at paddyhills can be of large portions! We\'ve also ordered the truffle fries and it comes in a mountain quantity. \n<br />Mediterranean Flatbed comes with chicken breast and sunny side up egg on top of the bread. The taste of curry spices with cauliflower and bits of pomegranate makes the dish interesting.
This was the Mediterranean Flatbread ($18++ iirc), which was sous vide chicken breast and a sunny side up on the flat bread, served with a few pieces of cauliflower and curried cauliflower fritter on the side. The sous vide chicken breast was excellent, super tender and had the same spiced flavour as the cauliflower fritter. I love the fritters but they could be more generous with it. The let down of this dish was the flatbread, which turned really hard and chewy as the dish cooled down.
Tried the potato cake with cappuccino for brunch today: delicious with enticing food decor, foamy cappuccino with subtle sweetness with pretty floral design on it. I like the cozy ambience as well. The menu however does not have plenty enough of choices for vegetarian like me. Something that I felt disappointed of. I am sure it will attract more vegetarian, vegan alike,  &amp; health conscious customers if the menu is more vegan &amp; vegetarian friendly, including gluten-free menu. Something that I think the restaurant can work more on.
Latte and the Yuzu Bubble the way to go. 💪🏼\n<br />.\n<br />#paddyhillssg #latte #yuzu
Homey ambience aside (great for weekday tête-à-têtes with friends), this west side cafe once again makes our list for its delicious, totally Instagrammable plates and creative cooking. Just check out their much talked about Berry Muffcakes ($20). An upgraded version of their once famous berry ricotta hotcakes, the gorgeous plate sees slightly dense muffcakes (a cross between muffins and hotcakes) topped with vanilla bean ice cream cubes, fresh berries, and chocolate crumbs. It\'s tasty but also rich and sweet, so don\'t hesitate to share with a friend or two. Balance off the sugar with Paddy Hills\' stellar mains like the 黑 Rice ($22), a wok hei infused dish of squid ink rice drizzled with mentaiko mayo and served with flavourful fried chicken and egg, or the Green Papa ($26), which sees handmade herbed pappardelle slicked in a robust tomato sauce and topped with foie gras stuffed meatballs. On hot days, eschew coffee for the refreshing Autumn Iced Tea ($8), which surprises with umeshu jelly. Pro tip: Tucked in a quiet residential estate, this cafe is quite a trek from the nearest Haw Par Villa MRT station. Spare yourself the sweat and take a cab.\n<br />Avg Price: $40 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Rachel Xie
Cacio e Pepe with lardo and Mentaiko ($25).  Of course, no one forgets the cheese! LOVE THAT THEY DIDNT FILL THE WHOLE PLATE WITH CREAM yay! Just the right amount. SO GOOD.
I finally got to have a taste of the recommended and totally instaworthy Berry Muffcakes. I felt it was more of a muffin top served up like a pancake - texturally it was dense like pound cake, served with cubes of ice cream, berries and flowers. Not something I would order for breakfast (which is what my friend did) but quite nice for dessert! 
A beautifully seared seabass served on a rosti topped with a perfectly fried egg (runny yolk and all). Other than it being slightly salty (probably from the capers), it was delicious. 
A quiet Friday evening, thinking about my dreadful trip to Switzerland next week and how I could make it better.\n<br />🔸\n<br />It\'s winter there now, and kinda wishing it\'ll be autumn, pretty like this refreshing drink I had during a tasting. It actually has umeshu jelly in it, and is only mild sweet with pure maple. Still largely a tea, and not a sweet syrup drink, so I enjoyed this.
Currently craving ramen and it\'s bringing back memories of this rice-based interpretation. Slow-cooked in a pork bone broth, the al dente rice is packed with flavour, and comes accompanied by three thick discs of cha shu. I don\'t see this on the current menu, so I hope Paddy Hills brings this dish back soon!
PH Crab Roll - A perfect harmony of blue swimmer crab and roe is generously enveloped within a squid ink bun.
Herbed pappardelle pasta ensconced in a chunky, robust tomato sauce, served with meatballs. If you think those balls taste a little stronger than what you\'re used to, that\'s because they\'re made with foie gras. Uh huh. Paddy Hills always has to take everything pedestrian up a notch.
It\'s now more manageable to eat and share with two pieces instead of the one huge slab the last time, and still as fluffy as I remembered! Topped with an assortment of berries and vanilla ice cream, this is good for brunch or dessert even woohoo~
Not quite hotcakes, and not quite muffins, but quite a happy compromise between the two.
Homemade pappardelle infused with herbs, tossed with tomato sauce and topped off with a load of grated pecorino, under which is buried a sous vide egg yolk and foie gras meat balls.
-\n<br />Nursing a bad cold and thinking about the Truffle Fries ($26) at #PaddyHillsSG.\n<br />-\n<br />Crispy fries topped with shavings of pecorino &amp; black autumn truffle (5g). So addictive I think I ate 1/4 of the huge plate of fries. Ok, maybe 1/2? haha. #sorrynotsorry\n<br />-\n<br />PS: If you love #trufflefries, you got to order this. Available till 2 Jan 2017. While stocks last.\n<br />-\n<br />#paddyhills #ilovefries #instavideo #friesoverguys
🎄❄️🎅🏻 As part of the festive season, @paddyhills.sg is launching a Christmas special menu till end December! Imagine black truffle risotto, coloured carbonara or this softshell crab crossaint stuffed with mac&amp; cheese! 😋😋 Just stuff urself silly with great awesome food for this festive season and forget about the damage incurred(to both ur pocket and waistline)! 😉 Eat first and worry later 😎
Went for their highly raved (limited period) \'autumn truffle fries\', which comes with freshly shaved truffles. The portion was no doubt huge, 2-3x of normal serving, with generous topping of shaved parmesan. But we were rather disappointed with the truffle aroma &amp; taste. 😐The shaved truffle was almost fragrant-less. The only mild truffle taste which I can detect were originated from the drizzled truffle oil. For $26, only the portion is worth complementing. Another popular dish we tried was the prawn paste wings. Half-split chicken wings were well marinated and deep-fried, served with house chilli sauce. Personally thought the chilli was nice on its own, but overpowering, and masking the taste of prawn paste. Lastly, we ordered another xmas menu item - black truffle risotto. Good combination of different textures, crispy parmesan chip, creamy mushroom base and  juicy de-boned chicken wings! Only downside ... more like a funghi risotto. 🍄\n<br />More photo reviews on: www.thejulietmike.com/2016/12/29/paddyhills/
Instead of drizzling them with truffle oil, they use real truffle shaved in front of your eyes. It couldn\'t be fresher than this. Even after a while, the fries were still crispy. It\'s that good!!!! 😋😋😋\n<br />One portion can easily feed 3 or 4 pax. 🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟🍟\n<br />.\n<br />This was an invited tasting.
My kind of comfort food: buttery, velvety mashed potato enhanced with burnt onion jus, soft-centred deep-fried quail eggs, and wiry crisps of deep-fried potato strips.
-\n<br />Green and orange homemade pasta crowned with shavings of black truffle and pecorino. Served with black forest ham and sous vide egg yolk cos what\'s a carbonara without an egg yolk to create that rich, creamy sauce?\n<br />-\n<br />#paddyhillssg #carbonara #truffle
The Yuzu Effervescence ($7) from @paddyhills.sg, give the drink a good stir after the bubbles fade away. I drank a huge gulp before stirring and had a huge mouth of syrup. Though the drink is definitely on the sweeter side, best for sharing!
Within the Meringue case hold a chocolate mousse ball and lingonberry sauce (very Christmasy flavours), drizzled with lemon curd and chocolate soil with lychee balls. A Sweet Sweet treat but I felt had too many things going on.
The Colourful Carbonara ($26) looks interestingly like a Christmas Pasta tree with truffle and cheese snow. Like this one more from the 2 pastas we\'ve tried in @paddyhills.sg\'s Christmas Truffle Specials (available till end of Dec). Homemade pasta with Black Forest ham, sous vide egg and LARD 🙌🏻 Usual combination of meaty flavours with a slight twist.
.\n<br />All of us were in agreement that this was the best dish of the day. The risotto was fragrant and full pack of flavours. Freshly shaved black truffles on top complements the dish very well.\n<br />.\n<br />This dish is a part of @paddyhills.sg \'s Christmas menu that will be available until the end of this month. Thank you Paddy Hills for hosting us.
Black Truffle Risotto ($28) - Essentially oyster mushroom, de-boned chicken wing, parmesan chip and raw quail\'s egg yolk.
Before trying Paddy Hills\' rendition of the titular truffle fries, i was wondering who will actually fork out $26 for a plate of truffle fries.
Xmas Muffcake - Berries, mint ice cream, green soil and magic balls
They just launched their Christmas menu! Available until the end of the month. Thanks @paddyhills.sg for the invitation to try your new menu. Stay tuned for more details on the individual item.\n<br />.\n<br />In frame:\n<br />Soft Shell Crab Croissant ($26)\n<br />Black Truffle Risotto ($28) - must try 😋\n<br />Tenderloin 250g ($38)\n<br />Autumn Truffle Fries ($26) - must try 😋\n<br />Chicken and Waffles ($28)
Looking colourful and festive, this is actually a chocolate mousse ball with lingonberry sauce covered in lemon curd and laid on chocolate soil. Those with a sweet tooth may like this, while some may not like how the tartness of the lingonberries and lemon went with the chocolate mousse.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Would love to try their bread and butter pudding next time. This photo is taken during a tasting
Tried this special edition of the regular muffcakes during a tasting. It\'s thicker and fluffier than regular hotcakes, and littered with berries and chocolate crumbs and topped with mint ice cream which was refreshing. I prefer to mix in the ice cream to moist the muffcakes before eating.
[Invited Tasting, New Christmas Truffle Menu] I already love Christmas, and now the Christmas menu came with all things truffles? 😊😋\n<br />🔸\n<br />Out of the 13 items on the new menu, we had the following as pictured: Autumn Truffle Fries ($26); Soft Shell Crab Croissant ($26); Black Truffle Risotto ($28); Chicken and Waffles ($28); and Tenderloin with Shaved Truffles ($38).\n<br />🔸\n<br />Such an enjoyable morning at the rustic yet classy cafe along South Buona Vista Road, with an equally trendy crowd gracing the venue. Detailed review on individual items to follow soon.
This dish has a little something of what people love - a soft shell crab, a squid ink croissant, or creamy truffled mac and cheese, together with finishing touches of bacon crumbs and green soil.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I like how the croissant was infused with squid ink and baked till flaky yet chewy and buttery inside, I also like the crisp soft shell crab. It\'s a creative dish that\'s understandably difficult to balance due to many things going on here, so the truffled mac and cheese seemed a misfit here. I could however have that squid ink croissant with coffee on a beautiful morning like this. (Photo taken during a tasting)
This is another hearty main course we tried during a tasting for Paddyhills festive menu. This suits large eaters, as it came with one whole fried chicken drumstick atop fluffy waffles. The \"maple glazed bacon\" mentioned in the menu is actually two large slabs (yes, for large eaters!) of pork belly that can get fatty. This also came with apple pear chutney to liven things up for this festive season, and is available till end of this year.
Unanimous favourite amongst us. See those shaved truffles atop this creamy, umami and slightly earthy risotto cooked to an al dente consistency.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This rich risotto, packed with strong flavours and fragrance, was thoughtfully balanced by adding oyster mushrooms and raw shiitake mushrooms. Chicken wings were deboned and marinated in soy, while the raw quail egg were added for aesthetic purpose. What was surprising was that the crispy chip it sits on - it\'s crispy parmesan cheese!\n<br />🔸\n<br />As with most risotto, it gets gelat after a while especially when the seasoning are also rather heavy handed here, but we all love this.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
Thought this went very with the festive Christmas menu even though it isn\'t part of the new menu.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I could have this as a dessert since it\'s also sweet. I like how it was refreshed by yuzu and plum, with chunks of grape jelly, kinda like our \'aiyu\' in bubble tea drinks.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The Christmas Truffles menu is only available till end of Dec, while this drink might stay longer. This was taken at a tasting
Order this and a black truffle would be freshly grated before you to bring the aroma of truffles right under your very nose. That\'s like a fine dining experience in a cafe.\n<br />🔸 \n<br />These fries was served hot, so the heat pushes the aroma of the freshly grated truffle all around the table. It has the obligatory but necessary creamy and mildly sweet parmesan cheese, but what\'s notable is that these are one of the few thick cut fries that are crispy and remain crispy till desserts.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Finally a truffle fries with real truffles, that\'s truffle fries at atas level, and it\'s one of the best truffle fries I had. This is taken at an invited tasting.
One of the dessert on Christmas specials. Spongey pudding with chocolate swirls, drench in light creme anglaise sauce surrounded by nuts and chocolate soil for that additional crunch. Mint ice cream block was a refreshing finish touch though I would prefer vanilla ice cream.
I went straight to their Christmas menu and chose the Black Truffle Risotto (S$28.00). While the first few mouthful was more salty than I expected, and the parmesan chip was not crispy like a taco shell, every ingredient in this risotto is distinct in taste yet went pretty much in sync. The black truffle flakes added some crunch texture to the lunch, and the de-boned chicken winglet was adequately marinated. I guess this is to set me up for a dessert.
Paddy Hills ushers Christmas season in today with a limited-edition menu of Truffle Specials, including this pretty plate of pastel orange and green pasta – homemade – served with Black Forest ham, a sous vide egg yolk, and loads and loads of black truffle and pecorino shavings.
Welcoming the festive season with dishes heaped with 5 grams of Italian black autumn truffle.
Really appealing to the eye. \n<br />The fillet of it was of the right texture - buttery meaty texture served with miso eggplant purée, antiboise sauce (virgin olive oil, anchovies, basil and tomatoes) and snow snap peas.
Came with a surprise as molten chorizo mozzarella cheese comes flowing out of their homemade beef patty - well flavoured and really really yummy!! Topped with house cured bacon and that perfect sunny side up - take a huge bite from this and you will bound to forget all the blues 💪🏻 Thank you @paddyhills.sg for the warm hosting and @cassakating for extending the invite!!
Black Friday may be over, but there\'s still until the end of the month to check out the Black Friday Specials at @paddyhills.sg!
Alway so nice to see the folks @PaddyHills.SG crafting special menu for different occasion. Signature 黑rice, Black Sea, Chicken Roll, Crab Roll and Squid Ink Risotto can be found on the Black Friday menu but 4 other dishes are NEW!
Because you all know what day it is today – FRYDAY!!! Paddy Hills takes truffle fries to the next level with a shower of freshly shaved black autumn truffle over delicate tendrils of pecorino cheese on a heap of crispy-fluffy golden fries.
-\n<br />Soft Shell Crab Croissant ($24), one of the Black Friday Specials. Flaky squid ink croissant, crispy soft shell crab, creamy mac &amp; cheese—everything I love on a plate! What\'s not to love about this dish? Never mind the carbs and calories; it\'s worth it!\n<br />-\n<br />Enjoy 10% off all dishes from the Black Friday menu between 25-27 November! Don\'t miss it!\n<br />-\n<br />#paddyhills #paddyhillssg #blackfriday2016
It\'s Black Friday week and the ever-innovative @paddyhills.sg has created a special menu for the occasion!
The way to my heart is through my palette, @paddyhills.sg knows best.
The squid ink rice actually had this wok hei taste to it, and the onsen egg mixed into it made it even more rich and flavourful. It could taste slightly too cloy but yet addictive. I actually finished it on my own while I see other tables sharing it among 2 to 4 persons even. The fried chicken was very meaty with thin batter which is always better than having more batter than meat. Overall, really love this dish!
All three components - the black rice, fried chicken and egg were all done really well.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Called the \"黑 rice\", it is fried with squid ink and garlic, then topped with creamy mentaiko mayo. My wife and I were surprised to discover scent of wok hei in it! The sous vide egg has a perfect consistency -  like soft boiled eggs but not as watery. The fried chicken retains two distinct layers - first layer of crispy but light skin that crumbles gently as you bite into it, second layer of meat that retains its juice.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Also a quiet spot for lunch on a weekday.
Having lots of matcha items lately and the most sinful as of yet is Paddy Hills’ over-the-top, Mount Matcha. Complete with a crown of cotton candy, the tall glass is filled with smooth, creamy rich and totally matcha-li-cious milkshake as well as a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Sending me to a sugary cloud nine, the addition of cereals in the concoction gave a good crunch and made it less cloying. But you can make things more decadent with the matcha syrup served together. Not as sweet as expected, the touch of bitterness is enjoyable though best to add it bit by bit.
👱🏽‍♀️: No.\n<br />👱🏻: There\'s gonna be good food.\n<br />👱🏽‍♀️: Okay, I be ready in 10mins.
YEAH!! Heard that Truffle dishes are here for two more weeks before we bid addio. Capellini ($26) is cold thin-strand pasta tossed with scallop, Greenland shrimp (cold water prawn), roe, shrimp powder and of course, Autumn truffle slices. Truffle taste might not be as strong as other dishes but love the combination.
I rarely journey to the west but this Hei Rice at Paddy Hills is constantly tempting me to go back. The fried chicken that comes with the dish is fried till crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The mentaiko sauce goes very well with the squid ink fried rice which also has a wok hei taste to it. Awesome stuff!
This muffcakes is my very first when I had a craving for ricotta hotcakes. I must say it formed a positive impression on my tastebuds making me try more of such fattening indulgence. The muffcakes provides a crispy crust with a fluffy cake interior. The magic balls that comes with it quickly went into my friend\'s tummy. The cube vanilla ice cream definitely stands out in photos. It also goes exceedingly well with the muffcakes but do go in a group. It\'s too much for 2 people even when we only shared a main.

Originating from Italy, this dish is made of grounded cornmeal and has a porridge-like creamy mixture. Using black forest ham, sous vide egg, cheddar crumbs, parmesan and slices of black truffle, it\'s an assault of richness and flavor.
Only available on weekdays, the truffle fries were super addictive with the truffle mayo! 😅 or you could dip it into the truffle polenta!
SUCH A PRETTY PRESENTATION! LOVED THE TASTE, a pity it\'s a bit expensive! LOVE IT THOUGH TIME TO SAVE UP 8/10
3.5 munchies: Loaded with porcini, raw English buttons, and shavings of fresh black autumn truffles from Umbria, Italy, the Risotto was cooked through to a creamy consistency. The raw quail egg yolk and Parmesan chip sitting above added richness and crisp to the multi- textured and flavoured rice. Finished off with delicious chicken jus, I say lose the soy-marinated chicken wing that served no purpose to the dish.
Presenting a refreshed menu, Paddy Hills has just launched a new line up of dishes last evening featuring 6 specially crafted mains which incorporates premium Italian Black Autumn Truffles all the way from Umbria! Available for a limited time only (till they deplete their supply), the items have managed to showcase a good variety of ways to enjoy the seasonal truffles, all with intriguing flavour pairings and elements of fun.
A unanimous favorite for us albeit the hefty price tag was this delicately seasoned Autumn Truffle Fries served with 5 grams of freshly shaved truffles. It was quite a sight to witness and we couldn\'t resist munching on them through the meal. I appreciate it very much when truffle fries aren\'t drowned in truffle oil because sometimes less is really more.
🎉 \n<br />Highly recommend the Risotto ($28) with a strong earthy mushroom flavour that is perfectly matched with the truffle aroma.
As Summer Truffles replaced with Autumn Truffles, they have specially created 6 dishes using these truffles but only available for limited time! Each of these dishes are served with 5g of black truffle imported from Umbria, Italy. WOAH~
🚨 From this evening, Paddy Hills will be launching a limited time period menu (that will probably last 1-2 weeks) of 7 dishes, featuring Black Autumn Truffles specially brought in from Umbria, Italy! This here is the Capellini with scallops, flavourful Greenland shrimps, roe, shrimp powder and of course, topped with 5 grams of aromatic and earthy Black Autumn Truffles! Other dishes you can expect include Autumn Truffle Fries (our fav!), Risotto and Polenta. It\'s time to head down if you\'re a truffle lover!
Never have I ever had so much truffle at one sitting… not that I am complaining. Living the life in a truffle induced food coma, Paddy Hill’s soon-to-be-launched specials (which would be available from tomorrow evening), will see each item served with 5 grams of Black Autumn Truffles from Umbria, Italy. YAS, 5 grams! Atas, right!

This tenderloin is part of Paddy Hills\' special menu featuring Black Autumn Truffles from Umbria, Italy. It\'s served with a king oyster mushroom, charred scallions topped with potato nest and foie chawanmushi. I don\'t take beef so I can\'t comment on the taste but if you\'re like me, no fret, look out for the the 5 other truffled dishes!
Under the 5 grams of shaved truffles and vermicelli are meatballs made with beef and pork, foie stuffing in wham bam sauce. This dish is 1 of the 7 from Paddy Hills\' limited menu featuring Italy\'s Black Autumn Truffles, which will be available starting this evening!
This is the ultimate indulgence! Beautiful crisp fries with grated hard cheese pecorino, white truffle oil, and 5g of Italian black autumn truffle grated right in front of you! As if this wasn\'t enough, the stellar truffle mayo dip takes it up a notch!
One of the best truffle fries around!
Steak was a bit under seasoned with uneven doneness, but a good cut of beef nonetheless. The mash potato and foie chawanmushi was good! The dish comes with king oyster mushroom and black fungus so you get a balanced meal. And to make it more luxurious, 5g of Italian black truffles!
Ravioli with seafood mousse and scallop floss. The caper vinaigrette complements the seafood but I am not a fan of capers in general. Again, the black truffles just makes everything better!
The polenta is nothing short of amazing - light, well seasoned and fluffy! The saltiness from the Black Forest ham and Parmesan really brings out the best in polenta. I enjoyed the light crunch that the cheddar crumbs gave. Mix in the sous vide egg for an even richer texture. This is the cheapest truffle dish from their new menu (limited time) at $15! Pictured at the top right is the super pretty beer slushie. 
NEW! @paddyhills.sg has just introduced its new specials that have one thing in common: black autumn truffles from Umbria, Italy!
Tried out the new menu and the ramen risotto and Black Sea (with fried chicken!!) was absolutely delicious. Wished this was less pricey and out of the way 😢
Paddy Hills does woah us even with the presentation of such simple dish, TRUFFLE FRIES ($25). A bowl pile high of piping hot fries, abundance of Parmesan cheese and 5grams of Italian black autumn truffles shaved right in front of you!! As it is not enough, homemade truffle mayo dip comes along too~
I, for one, am super glad they\'re calling these \'hotcakes\' \"Muff Cakes\" now, instead of parading them as a copy of Top Paddock\'s that went viral. Especially great cause it\'s resemblance to the crisp and sweet muffin tops was what I loved about their pancakes to begin with! Absolutely loving these pretty, photogenic muff cakes that are as yummy as they are fuss-free — it\'s really just Nestle-like ice cream and their version of hotcakes, presented in a really interesting way. Looove those little citrusy baubles that add such a wonderful burst of sunlight with each bite!
Wasn\'t a fan of their previous Aussie/Melbourne-esque (read: rip-off) menu, so the hype on Paddy Hills\' latest lunch/dinner menus didn\'t really catch on - till now. Really glad they added their own touches to these newer dishes! 黑rice here was a fantastic medley of smokey squid ink rice, just enough creamy mentaiko mayo, and 👌🏻 soft-boiled egg to tie everything together. Definitely one to look out for and well deserved the IG hype. #Burpproved
-\n<br />Squid ink rice drizzled with mentaiko mayo &amp; topped with sous vide egg. Served with PH fried chicken at the side. The squid ink rice has distinct taste of wok-hei. Good on its own but even better when mixed with the sous vide egg and mentaiko mayo. If you like beef, try the flank steak 黑 Rice ($24) from the dinner menu.

Freshly shaved AUSTRALIAN TRUFFLES on your truffle fries?
Paddy Hills special; Big Breakfast ($29)
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Available only for the next 2 weeks:\n<br />The Truffle Big Breakfast ($29++)\n<br />.\n<br />Because the chef managed to get hold of some gorgeous Western Australia black truffles, she has created two limited edition dishes with them. One\'s the Truffle Fries ($25++) and the other is this beauty.\n<br />The huge, and I mean huge, plate has house-cured salmon and soft scrambled eggs on an artisanal bagel, a heavyweight 1-inch thick slab of housecured bacon (this is so damn good as it is extremely tender!), guacamole, shiitake mushrooms sautéed in white butter and some fresh rocket. The highlight of getting this though must be having 2 grams of black truffle shaved right at the table when the dish is brought to you.\n<br />I recommend hustling your appetite over pronto if you want to indulge in this because those black truffles ain\'t gonna be hanging around for long!
This is way beyond the usual squid ink variety. Even the crunchy-skinned deepfried chicken fillet and onsen egg were overshadowed by those unusually delicious, garlicky black grains streaked with mentaiko mayo.
\nTruffle oil, please take a seat. The stage is set for REAL TRUFFLE. Upon the heap of crisp, golden fries goes freshly-grated pecorino cheese, followed by 3 grams of shaved-on-the-spot black winter truffle imported from Western Australia. And finally, a sprinkle of smoked salt. For more intense truffle-liciousness, swipe the fries in the accompanying truffle mayo (you can get an extra saucer of it for $2++ if you like).\n<br />The portion is large but hey, if you want to have this decadent bowl all to yourself, no one\'s judging 😜\n<br />Do note this is available from tomorrow and for the next 2 weekends only.
It\'s not much to look at but this pile of pork will hold your tastebuds captive.\n<br />Coated with a light crunchiness, each piece of lean meat was already tender and juicy. But they went on to become crazy good when dunked in the spicy acidity of the accompanying Thai-style dip. .
Thanks for the invite. Featuring my favourite dish then, Scallop Ceviche. Squid ink cracker, miso, slaw &amp; oyster mushroom. Unique flavours and different textures to wow your tastebuds! ————————————————————————\n<br />Download the HollerOut app before you visit! \n<br />Promo Code: \"peanutloti\" to get $5 off your bill whenever you spend more than $50\n<br />Find out more:\n<br />http://wp.me/p73MHP-1o\n<br />————————————————————————
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Helmed by a really passionate and imaginative head chef and her tight team, the new items on Paddy Hills\' dinner menu defy easy categorisation. They seem more \"out there\" than most dishes I\'ve come across in recent memory, albeit in a very good way. Nothing is straightforward but your tastebuds will be entertained and satisfied. Here\'s a selection of what we were served:\n<br />1) Scallop Ceviche ($19++): An Asian-influenced appetiser made up of tiny cubes of raw scallops dressed in miso and topped with julienned cucumbers and fried oyster mushrooms on a squid ink rice cracker. Do eat this the moment it\'s served to enjoy it at its best. \n<br />2) Roasted Chicken ($24++): I was surprised at how well the flavours harmonised despite seemingly disparate at first glance. The juicy chicken (they use only fresh, not frozen) was in the unlikely company of a bright pink sauce (purple sweet potato sits at the top of its family tree) and what looked like \"sambal belachan\" (it\'s actually the chef\'s original \"Wham Bam\" sauce). The latter\'s a concoction I can\'t quite describe except that it worked well with the chicken and the yuzu element. Chewiness came courtesy of the quinoa scattered over.\n<br />3) Green Papa ($26++): I initially mistook this to be a vegetarian pasta but I couldn\'t be more wrong because the al dente parpadelle (made fresh daily mind you) was served with foie-gras meatballs. Yes, cut them open and watch the richness ooze. The appetising sauce earned its fair share of praises too.\n<br />4) Pink Cheesecake ($16++): My favourite dessert of the night was the gravity-defying, extra virgin oil-dotted cheesecake. Served in a huge bowl, the pink-with-pomegranate foam part of the cake practically floated over its scrumptious base of butter-rich crumbs. The spoonfuls that made their way into my mouth also hid passionfruit-flavoured \"magic balls. It\'s so fun when they burst, adding a zingy fruitiness to the cheesecake.
Expect these freshly grated truffles on your fries as well as on their crowd favorite brunch served with home cured salmon, bacon and a whole lot of truffly goodness!
Smooth and creamy risotto with mi cult salmon, topped with fried vermicelli reminiscent of the component in tze char dishes. And not forgetting the interesting addition of yogurt balls that pop in your mouth with a citrusy flavour! I couldn\'t stop going for the salmon which tasted like really soft aburi salmon! 😋
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Calling all potato lovers, this is a dream come true. Filling more than half of the massive bowl is ultra-smooth, rich-in-butter mashed potato. Atop that, a nest of the skinniest, crunchy rosti. What a fun contrast they make. But wait a minute, they\'re not alone. Deepfried quail eggs, house-pickled onions and a sweetish burnt onion jus are cleverly deposited in there to ensure no one gets potato-ed out.\n<br />The serving size is big enough to share between 3 to 5 people, depending on how many other dishes you plan to get. And how much you love potatoes 😆😁
The Berry Muffcake ($20) come with all the right ingredients such as vanilla bean ice cream (which I was sold instantly as they use the real vanilla pods) and passionfruit magic balls, besides the chocolate crumbs, pink milk and pumpkin seeds.
At $28, the Squid Ink Risotto comes with 4 cuts of mi cuit salmon, a fried vermicelli hairdo with roe and that surprise element of yogurt balls added to it. What\'s the most important consideration for a good risotto? It has to be that al dente arborio rice infused with a flavour that packs a punch. To top if all off, an accompanying element such as the salmon in this case which was slightly flame grilled on the outside and orange on the inside, that\'s soft and delicate when you cut it with a fork.
Anticipation at a high after hearing rave reviews on the food served here. My drink of the night was the Orange Sky ($8), made from blood orange, calpis and lemon. However, the one thing that stole the show was the magic balls aka yogurt bubbles from the Taste Like Purple ($8) drink. Can you also guess out of the 3 drinks, which is the one that\'s spiked?
\nThe \"Raw Aglio Olio\" was hands-down, my favourite dish at tonight\'s invited tasting. Yes, the name did intrigue but it was the flavours that had me floored.\n<br />Besides the tomato pasta that\'s made fresh from scratch daily, the dish featured raw, sashimi-grade sweet Amaebi shrimp, Hokkaido scallops and ebiko, as well as squid that\'s been lightly torched. All of these were tossed in olive oil with thin slices of fragrant, softened garlic and chilli, to create an evolved, sophisticated form of the familiar aglio olio pasta. 
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Alcoholic or not, our drinks came with enough bells and whistles for undeniable Instagram appeal. \"Orange Sky\" and \"Tastes Like Purple\" ($8 each) were designed for teetotalers with the former being pretty self-explanatory. The white grape-flavoured latter had a little more \"wow\" as it contained \"magic balls\". Made in-house, these pretty, light blue spheres lived up to their name. We popped them in our mouths, exerted the lightest pressure and in an instant, they burst, releasing a flood of refreshing Calpis-flavoured liquid. Dangerously addictive stuff 😋😋.\n<br />The less innocent \"Spiked Purple Lemonade\" ($18) came with a half-submerged bottle of Midori which had to be uncapped and poured in to mix. This playful lemon-based cocktail that had white peach, blue butterfly pea and roselle hibiscus, was very easy to drink as it wasn\'t overly tart.
This hotcake blew my mind AGAIN!! The crisp and the softness of the inside was breathtaking 🙌🏼 Though I feel like the price got higher and the amount of food we were given was smaller, it still didn\'t upset me that much. It\'s Paddy anyway, ya gotta be prepared to spend those bills 💸 Quite satisfied with my $20 meal today ☺️ So worth another visit!! 💟 ✨
•\n<br />Berry Ricotta Hotcake v2. Soft and fluffy hotcakes (with slightly crisp exterior) topped with two cubes of vanilla bean ice-cream, fresh berries, magic balls, a splash of pink milk and a sprinkle of chocolate crumbs. Tastes as good as it looks!

Paddy Hills is a must-go for brunch. The Green Scramble &amp; Bacon - house cured bacon chop, walnut pesto crushed potatoes &amp; mustard dressing - is certainly worth the $23. Service is good too. 
Delicious new menu at Paddy Hills that makes it worth the trip. Plus from 6th-9th August the 51st bill of each day will be on the house! Can\'t wait to go back to try more dishes. 😋\n<br />#PaddyHillsSG
I can do it all day, err day at @paddyhills.sg! \n<br />Their new brunch menu is pretty extensive &amp; covers everything from something light, to something extremely substantial &amp; heavy!
Vanilla bean ice cream squares over pillowy soft pancakes with fresh berries and chocolate crumbs 🍳🍓✨ (📍Paddy Hills, 38 South Buona Vista Road) #burpple
There wasn\'t any wow factor to the chicken; but the black rice was the real star. It had a deep smokey flavour, when mixed with the mentaiko and egg, the taste was as good as you would probably be trying to imagine now. A dish as exciting as their ramen risotto. #burpple
Also on the menu at @paddyhills.sg, the drunken pig ($15). Fragrant pork collar fillets covered in crispy batter were unceremoniously chucked onto a pretty ceramic plate and served with a dish of nam Jim sauce. Now, the pork wasn\'t the most tender of meats, but it was a good starter. Chewy, crunchy and a heady meat flavour that was cut into by the sour, fish-sauce like nam jim dip. Very enjoyable and very generous portion for a cafe like this!
Back at Paddy Hills to try out their new menu. This is definitely the must-try dish!! Breaking your own sous vide egg, mixing well with squid ink rice, garlic and mentaiko mayo. There was a strong \"wok hei\" taste that each bite was more delicious than the last. For lunch they serve with PH fried chicken but heard at night it is with flank steak, so beef lover you know what to do.
Think pan fried seabass resting on a bed of rosti with a pretty sunny side up as blanket. Simple but delicious! 
Man oh man, was @paddyhills.sg a delight! I decided to treat myself to a soothing meal today, and tucked into a plate of Pink Rigatoni ($25). The snowy shavings of mild Parmesan brought a soft, cloud-like texture to the cacio e pepe - basically a fancy way to describe the creamy cheese and peppery sauce that coated the al dante rigatoni (those tube-like pasta bits). You\'d expect something heavy and tiresome, but the plateful of rigatoni was instead comforting and lip-smacking good. The cheese and pepper sauce was just thick enough to generously coat each tube of pasta, and the surprise burst of pepper, caught the attention of each diner from the first bite. Here, the flavour in this pasta dish comes from slivers of chewy, sinful lardo. Now, what is lardo? That\'s basically cured strips of fatback - literally the fat off a pig\'s back. Think... Thick, chewy slices of bacon with an enhanced salami-like flavour. I adored how beautifully they were plated, the pale tubes artfully dressed upon a thin layer of tasty Mentaiko, that sadly was just decor, was only just thick enough for me to scrap.
🍴\n<br />This dish of squid ink rice with mentaiko sauce, sous vide egg, and flank steak (for dinner, lunch is fried chicken) is absolutely delectable. The complexity and umami flavours explode with each bite. Although the mentaiko sauce looks little, it was creamy and packed a punch. The texture of the sous vide egg was extremely viscous and gave the rice a lot more \'weight\' in texture and taste. The flank beef steak was firm and packed with its juices and was not too chewy nor beefy, done to a pink tenderness of medium rare which I requested for. An absolute wonder of a dish, I am sold. This is like paying cafe food prices for fine dining cuisine; could totally see this dish come out from a hotel restaurant. Amazing. #burpproved 👍🏻 -\n<br />Hearty/Tasty/Worthy: 4 / 5 / 4.5\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple #burppletastemaker #cafehopping  #localcafes #instagood #instafood #vscofood #vscophile #sgcafe #eatoutsg #openricesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #cafehoppingsg #buzzfeast #f52grams #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #tablesituation #cafefood #SGmakandiary #foodstagram #foodphotography #hypebeast #whati8today #tslmakan #singaporeinsiders #onthetable #8dayseat
From Paddy Hills\' new menu, luscious blue swimmer crab meat in a soft squid ink bun topped with lots of tobiko—just the way we like it. Comes with a side of kimchi slaw and fries. Plus a dollop of wasabi mayo is provided if you\'re adventurous, but we thought it didn\'t need it. Definitely a must try if you\'re visiting Paddy Hills!\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />Paddy Hills ‣ 38 South Buona Vista Road, Singapore 118164\n<br />#PaddyHillsSG #CrabRoll
These make great snacks on the side if you\'re dining at Paddy Hills. A slightly crunchy coating and chewy pork collar with a tangy dipping sauce. 😋\n<br />#PaddyHillsSG #PorkCollar
The earnest chicken couldn\'t help but be completely overshadowed by the greasy, comforting and scrumptious rice, which possessed the delectable smokiness of a Simon Road kopitiam wok. 3.9/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Paddy Hills.
Berry muffcake ($20+)\n<br />A pancake look with the taste of a muffin. Very moist on the inside. A colorful and beautiful piece of art. But why is there so many flavored pops in all their dishes. I think that could be omitted out as it does nt match well. \n<br />8
•\n<br />#PaddyHills has crossed over to the dark side, joining the black food trend by introducing a series of black food like Squid Ink Rice (黑 Rice as they call it), Scallop Ceviche with Squid Ink Cracker, Squid Ink Risotto, Chocolate Pasta and Squid Ink Crab Roll (as featured).\n<br />•\n<br />One of our favourite dishes, the PH Crab Roll features a squid ink bun stuffed with blue swimmer crab meat and topped with three types of roe. Served with kimchi slaw, crispy fries and wasabi mayo at the side.
Custom-made squid ink bun bolstering clumps of sweet, hand-picked blue swimmer crab flesh and roe. Wasabi mayo, kimchi slaw and fries play supporting roles.
A little more acidic zing would have made this spot-on, but there\'s still plenty to love about this generous serving of glistening scallop tartare cradled in a \"bubbly\" squid ink cracker and topped with oyster mushrooms and cucumber slaw. The miso dressing hints of ginger, which, together with the garnish of spring onion, gives this a decidedly Asian flavour profile.
A rather big portion but isn\'t quite as filling as imagined, the Pink Cheesecake is a cheesecake in Espuma foam form with pomegranate, magic balls and crumbs. Pretty interesting as it seems, the dish is smooth and sweet but with crunchy textures that carried oat-like flavours from the crumbs with popping lemon \"sago\" balls. Personally it\'s a rather refreshing take on a conventional cheesecake using modern cooking methods in a different presentation, and it\'s probably worth trying once for the fun of it.
The signature dish of Paddy Hills gets a revamp, and the Berry Ricotta Pancakes have now became the Berry Muffcakes which is a smaller portion with two Muffcakes that is much more manageable for one to visit. They have gotten rid of the Ricotta in this one, and it consist of Vanilla bean ice-cream squares, chocolate crumbs, magic balls, pink milk (pomegranate juice + yogurt) and pumpkin seeds. Felt this version is their best version yet, especially when they have achieve a consistency for the pancakes that is lighter and fluffier than the previous, yet maintaining the same fragrance in the batter that we are all familiar of (which is really comforting and McDonald\'s esque in a pleasant way). As this version has no Ricotta, it\'s less heavy on the palate, and the ice-cream answers to all that everyone had been dreaming of about their Berry Ricotta Hotcake.
Creme Anglaise, Chocolate Mousse, Macerated Berries and Hazelnut. Rather abstract in my opinion and can be a little hard to understand — it comes in strands that tasted a tad doughy and my mind had a lot of difficulty trying to understand how everything binds the chocolate and pasta-like aesthetic together. Would really go for the Berry Muffcakes anytime which is pretty much a foolproof dish that\'s easier to understand.
Homemade Squid Ink Spaghetti, Greenland Shrimps, Baby Squid, Fish Crumbs and Calamansi. An umami bomb I would say, right from the squid ink pasta and all the way to the fish crumbs which were twined within — each strand has a good level of savouriness that just adds to the dish\'s flavour profile for a slight crunchy, garlicky and saltiness similar to fried fish skin. You would probably love this if you are one who can\'t resist slightly heavier flavours like me!
Looks relatively simple but this new dish @paddyhills.sg will blow you away with the wok hei those little 黑 grains have!👊🏿 
Herbed Homemade Paparadelle, Foie Meatballs, Sous-Vide Egg, Pecorino. The pasta is tossed in a sweet and tangy sauce and accompanied with chunky meatballs with foie gras centre stuffed within, with cheesy flavours from the shaved Pecorino over the top.
Mi Cuit Salmon, Yogurt, Vermicelli, Roe. Coming in a sea of black, one could definitely taste the savoury flavours in this one coming from the squid ink while the risotto comes with the lemon popping balls for a little zestiness for yet another dimension of flavour. The salmon was done delightfully with a raw centre while topped with crispy vermicelli for a contrast of texture though it could have been a bit more proportionate.
Squid Ink Rice, Garlic, Mentaiko Mayo, sous-vide egg and PH Fried Chicken. The successor of the Kimchi Fried Rice, the 黑rice feels very much like the local fried rice despite how it looks, complete with wok hei that\'s all wonderful when you mix in the mentaiko mayo and sous-vide egg (you would have to crack the egg shell to get it out). Fried chicken was also satisfyingly crisp and juicy, a good match to the squid ink rice. One of the favourite dishes at the table.
Squid Ink Bun, Swimmer Crab, Black Bean Mayo, Kimchi Slaw. Coming with three different types of roe including a green wasabi roe, this is their twist to the lobster roll featuring crab instead. Do dip the fries into the wasabi mayo on the side — creamy sauce which unlike most wasabi mayo I have tried recently, gives that oomph by being slightly numbing which gives tickles the tastebuds.
One of the new dishes on the brunch menu at Paddy Hills. A creative touch where the fresh greens meets a playful touch with Parmesan Chips and Apple Jello that switches things up a little from the conventional salad. Think of savoury shards of crispy cheese and sweet, fruity jelly that amps up the texture of the dish and adds a little contrast to the greens.
Special pour over coffee. The coffee is not too strong and fruity. Perfect drink to escape from the crazy heat these days.
Came here for the pretty and super hyped up Ricotta Berries Pancake which was surprisingly tasty - but seriously filling! If you\'re showing up with female friends, consider sharing this dish.
A must-have at Paddy Hills, their Berry Ricotta Hotcake was just as good, if not better than I remembered. A revised version from the one I had, close to a year ago, it was much more fluffy the second time around. Embellished with berries, dollops of Yuzu gel and maple syrup, the beautifully textured hotcake was as expected, both crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
In true Paddy Hills style with added elements of fun and play in their new menu, they had us all amused when this revamped Four Little Pigs was placed on our table - just a sheet of seaweed?! But what laid underneath was a rich and umami bed of tonkatsu risotto with tender pork slices. The white stuff ain\'t dirt but \'pork snow\', a meaty flavored powder, which will introduce your tastebuds to a whole new world! 
Injecting an element of playfulness to their new and improved Tonkotsu Risotto, Paddy Hills will be introducing a new menu real soon.
Tasty Tastemaker Tour with new friends~ Chatting over good food and drinks!
Thanks to fellow Burpple Tastemaker Kenneth, we actually got to try Paddy Hill\'s Cold Brew at stop 2 of the Tasty Tastemaker Tour. Brewed from beans that are \"roasted\" via the sous vide method for around 18(?) hours. The result of this cold brew is seemingly light-flavored coffee that boasts of bright floral notes that is actually pretty soothing to have. Since everything at Paddy Hills is served for both the palate and the eyes, it comes atop a wooden board with a glass and the bottle of cold brew lying atop with various other items scattered across for the visual impact. Definitely something different from the usual cuppa.
An old favourite and my favourite at Paddy Hills.
The second stop of the @Burpple #TastyTastemakerTour, @paddyhills.sg!
So what is a visit to Paddy Hills if we did not order the Berry Ricotta Hotcakes? We definitely had fun taking photos of this photogenic dish during the Tasty Tastemaker Tour, especially with all that berries and that foam that gets those who love doing pouring shots in a frenzy. Having had Version 1 when I visited them when they were still new, it\'s pretty surprising to find it evolve into this Version 3 which I found a big difference in flavours and textures which had certainly improved over the times. It\'s more pancake-fluffy this time round, though still laced in maple syrup which reminds me of the happier and innocent days where McDonald\'s pancakes was \"the moment\" in my life on weekends. They are also more generous with the berries now too, and the pourable foam definitely makes it a fun dish to have on the table. Do make a visit if you hadn\'t had it yet; we have heard a Version 4 in the works that would be launched alongside the new menu revamp that will see the introduction of the Rigatoni and Four Little Pigs as well.
The spiritual successor to the Tonkotsu Risotto at Paddy Hill\'s, we were lucky enough to try it as it is from the yet-to-be-released menu which they would be releasing in a couple of week\'s time during the Tasty Tastemaker Tour. Featuring a playful menu while maintaining the dramatic presentation of the dishes here, the dish comes blanketed with a layer of seaweed that is meant to be shredded atop the risotto and mixed with to enjoy. It also comes with an interesting element; Pork Snow which I shall let everyone figure out on their own. I hadn\'t tried the previous version of this dish, but I enjoyed the savoury Risotto that came with Japanese Char Siew with a smoky flavour. Definitely something I would look forward to on a weekend.
My must-have order every time I visit Paddy Hills, great for sharing (the carbs) with a group of friends. The hotcakes ($23) are light and fluffy, with the crispy edges definitely being the best part of it. Decorated with an assortment of berries, edible flowers and pine nuts to add colour and amp up its aesthetics. And finally for extra sweetness, the vanilla yogurt and maple syrup was a dream. Frothy and light, complimenting the buttery hotcakes so well. There\'s always room for dessert 😍🙌🏻
Mini Man Tou burgers American-style, with a fat juicy minced beef patty, melted cheese, tomato slices and pickles. ($25) Gonna be biased towards this because I love anything with those golden, crispy Man Tou buns. The meat could do with a nice glazing of barbeque sauce imo, but it does taste just as flavourful without. The dish did come with a small saucer of barbeque sauce for dipping though. The truffle fries on the side however was just plain fries. Absolutely zero truffle. I\'m pretty sure the chef had forgotten to toss abit of truffle oil, which is kinda disappointing because I had their truffle fries the last time and they were pretty good 😞
The menu at Paddy Hills is always changing, so it\'s about time for a revisit 😂 Ordered the Sea Bass ($32). One of the more pricey items on the menu so I had higher expectations. Sadly, it was kind of disappointing. The fish was good though, with its skin cooked nice and crispy without being overly greasy. Just wished it came with better sauces to complement the main dish. Written as \"Smoked Eggplant\" on the menu was certainly not what I had expected: an eggplant purée that leaves an odd charred and slightly bitter aftertaste. The green salsa was ok, and it tasted good with the crispy noodles, but not so much with the fish. Overall, not a recommendation. There\'re definitely better mains at Paddy Hills.
Perhaps the most beautiful hotcake I have come across thus far! This was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside (although it wasn\'t moist) the texture resembled somewhat of a cookie from how easily it fell apart, but for a sweet tooth like me - I could easily polish the plate. I have to admit I prefer Hotcakes that have a moist texture on the inside so I wasn\'t the most impressed with this. Wish there were more berries and Yuzu gel tho! Whatever was in the bottle (tasted like yogurt foam) was seriously bomb, but it was quite hard to get out of the bottle, I literally had to stick my knife in to get it out :\'&gt;
My friends kept commenting how this was their favourite dish, because of how well done the meatballs were and combined with the truffle hash and egg it was extremely flavourful. I tried the truffle hash and my only gripe is I wish they had more! 
I forgot the name for this dish, but it bad beautiful red-pink salmon (possibly from the beetroot as dye?) Personally I thought the portions here for main courses weren\'t very generous, there was very little quinoa and salmon, plus the veggies were drowned in their dressing it felt overwhelming. Couldn\'t taste the olive dust either :(
Tucked at the corner where a famous duck rice stall used to reside, this cafe seems like a refreshing change to the once old school and traditional looking place. You\'ll be greeted with the aroma of coffee brew and the loveliest smile on the staffs\' faces. We ordered a bacons &amp; eggs and also the belly good Tonkatsu Risotto. Amazing how these two dishes contain pork bellies yet worlds apart. The breakfast dish was a good combination of sweet and savoury. The Bacon was caramelized to perfection not too sweet, just the way we liked it. If you\'re thinking of your usual salty, thinly sliced and easily available Bacon, think again. The Risotto came with a twist of japan. Combining the essence of shoyu or miso? Brilliant. Although it tasted very much like seaweed chips but we loved how rich the unami in this dish tasted. I\'m not a rice lover but I gobbled this down. Definitely calories worthy. Ordered a hot mocha and loved how their chocolate complements the coffee. Overall, a satisfying meal. Would definitely head back again for more! East siders can certainly travel down because it\'s worth the distance!
Did you know that Paddy Hills recently had their menu updatd? The new and improved Berry Ricotta Hotcake with Blueberry Sugar, berries, pine nuts, yuzu gel, vanilla yogurt &amp; maple syrup [$23]
Unless you live in the Pasir Panjang area, making the trek down to this Westside cafe takes serious planning, but boy are we glad we did. Because it is tucked away in a quiet residential estate, it is relatively peaceful on weekday afternoons, making it ideal for an afternoon with your favourite girlfriend. Catch up on all the goss as you sip on a smooth, well-balanced Latte ($5.50) and nibble on the much photographed Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($23). Okay who are we kidding? Like us, you\'ll probably be too busy scooping up the crumbs of this sweet, moist and beautifully textured hotcake to think about chatting. We love the sticky sweetness of the drizzled on maple syrup, as well as the uplifting dollops of yuzu gel. Granted, it is a lot pricier than the version at Curious Palette, but the texture is a lot more consistent and its smaller size also means you\'re less likely to tire of it. We\'re pleased to share that Paddy Hills executes its mains very well, too. Like many Burpplers, we thoroughly enjoyed the Tonkotsu Risotto ($25). Creamy yet al dente risotto topped with tender, flavourful pork belly and a raw quail’s egg yolk. Pro-tip: The cafe is quite a trek from the nearest Haw Par Villa MRT station. Spare yourself the sweat and take a cab.
Miss this place so much :/ can\'t wait for exams to end... One more paper! #throwback
People always order the ricotta berry hotcakes, but this Fish and Potato dish was really good too! Sea bass with crispy rosti, plus that gorgeous egg. Yums. Be prepared to wait for a table at brunch / lunch time though. 
Iced cocoa probably and it taste nice! We\'ve ordered a plate of french fries and a plate of fried chicken to have a long rubbish chat that night. All I love is that drink only, with 4/5 while food wise 3/5 overall. 
Definitely recommended. Worth the price as the portion is big 
Best kimchi fried rice I have ever tasted 😍 definitely worth the price and the long walk to find this place 😂
It is a simple flat white, but I fell in love with the latte-art when the waitress bring this to my table. It is soo pretty 😍
Golden fried chicken pieces are covered with Har Cheong Gai aka Prawn Paste Chicken, the \"pungent\" smell is so strong that you can smell this dish before it arrives. Juicy pieces of chicken coupled with their own extra spicy house Chilli, it\'s just finger licking good!!
Came here for the hot cakes, but really enjoyed this Tonkotsu Risotto ($25) too. The pork was tender and flavourful, and the rice the right mix between creamy and al dente. A little heavy handed on the salt perhaps, but otherwise a tasty dish.
Throwing gluten-free out of the window today. Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($23). Pretty as a picture and darn tasty too.
The Food: \n<br />Premium prices for premium meat. Food is exceptionally good. The snapper ($25) did have a unique taste but leaves the usual fish smell in my mouth for hours. Striploin($26) is cook to perfection. Soft and juicy meat while maintaining minimum iron taste. Portion is more fine dining style but without the fine dining service and experience. 
On the table: Tonkotsu Risotto, Ricotta Hotcakes, Hot Chick and Garlic Fries, Ice Lattes. Not shown in picture: Pink Pasta &amp; Truffle Vongole. You can tell the staffs put in effort and dedication into preparing the dishes. Even the coffee barista tastes the mocha concoction before serving.
- crisp corners and fluffy interior, it is topped with berries, flower petals and mascarpone. Almost too pretty to be eaten. Please share this with someone because it\'s almost impossible to consume it on your own 😝
Main reason we\'re here was to try their Pink Pasta ($25), which sadly wasn\'t up to our expectation. Fresh pasta with bacon and asparagus in thick mentaiko sauce but there\'s only one prawn and one scallop, wish they were more generous though. \n<br />However, Tonkotsu Risotto ($25) managed to wow us. Tender torched Kurobuta pork belly that melts in the mouth plus a raw quail egg yolk mix into risotto for more flavour!! Note: Lunch menu is available from 11:30am during weekdays and 11am during weekends &amp; PHs.
Buttery rice with grilled tender pork, delightful crispies and seaweed garnish. 
I like that this is on a street filled with bars and even a random convenience store and a Zi char store, the owners really turned this place which is out of nowhere in pasir Panjang, to somewhere where people actually feel hipster enough to want to go out of the way to visit. 😂 They have pretty good service, and I loved my cup of Picolo Latte ($4.50). I thought the table arrangements were a bit cramped though, and the place was slightly dark. Nonetheless, the best part of this place for me was the artwork on the outside. Beautifully done : )
Lemme just say PADDY HILLS IS AS GOOD AS THE REVIEWS MAKE THEM OUT TO BE ya know the kind that keeps you coming back for more tAHa new found love gUyz anyway pink pasta is 👍🏿 very creamy but not the gelat kind, serving size is just nice for one haaAaAaaa I love u paddy hills 
because yesterday\'s drinking, today need good coffee.
The hotcake (note: NOT pancake) tastes like crispy 鸡蛋糕. Worth a try but maybe just once? Cuz it\'s quite expensive for a dessert. Mains are relatively alright with an Asian twist, but again, can be quite pricey. Coffee is top notch 👍🏼
Counting down to my Australia trip, where I\'ll get my hands on the original source of the ricotta hotcakes. For now, this would do 😌
Didn\'t try their specialties while here, but still plenty enjoyed the braised pork (right) which provided a modern twist to an-otherwise rather Asian dish. The pork was marinated well and left to its on devices would have been flavorful enough. Yet the garlic and Chinese vegetables that came with it added a refreshing touch. The classic breakfast didn\'t prove to be anything special, except the salsa, which was likely the most tasteful item there.
Tasty BBQ corn with a piece of scallop. But seriously for 16 dollars in a casual coffee place? I love this place for lunch and brunch. For dinner? Nah. Only ridiculously priced small plates on the menu and one pasta and a paella. 
love the asian-western fusion menu. i had a special chirashi don for lunch - with steak slices, onsen egg and fish roe. delectable 😍
Greedy us also tried out The Maze and Berry Ricotta Hotcakes yesterday at @paddyhills.sg. I\'d recommend this pasta with mentaiko, bacon, asparagus and fresh seafood. But then again, slap a big juicy scallop onto any dish in front of me and you\'re half way to a winning dish. 😂\n<br />⋅\n<br />There\'s a lot of dishes we were discussing to go back to try. But after the incident whilst paying, I probably wouldn\'t go back.\n<br />⋅\n<br />Basically we asked for the bill and was directed to the counter. So we packed up, walked up. I reached the cashier first and the girl at the counter shoved the receipt in my face to check. A little shocked I glanced at it. I haven\'t seen receipts being shoved into people\'s faces for ages, these days you would at least put it on the table or on a tray to look at even when paying at the counter. But that wasn\'t the part that pissed me off.\n<br />⋅\n<br />We decided to pay by credit card. Which didn\'t go through the first time. She didn\'t tell us the reason, didn\'t give the rejection receipt nor did she offer to try again. Fine. We asked if they take NETS, gave the card and it was also declined. The girl taking the payment didn\'t seem cooperative and started giving us the rolling eye + smirk look. She didn\'t really offer to try again but finally said the receipt says \"no dail tone\" which I then chipped in that it\'s an issue with their connection and not the card. She reluctantly tried NETS again and it worked but the whole time we were at the payment counter she gave us a screwed up, impatient, eyes rolling, smug face and for what reason we have no friggin\' idea. I thought I was the only one that felt the girl\'s impatience but once we walked out I asked my friend if she noticed and we both agreed the day was good till the payment because of that staff in particular and because of that we wouldn\'t go back.\n<br />⋅\n<br />Apart from the staff taking payment, the rest of the staff were super nice and helpful. They even said bye as we were walking out, which I would usually respond by turning around and smiling but knowing standing at the counter was an obviously unhappy glaring girl, I just kept walking and couldn\'t wait to be out of the cafe.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#PaddyHillsSG #SGcafe 🙄
This was surprisingly good. The rice was well executed - a good bite to it, while having soaked up tons of flavor. A little quail\'s egg yolk sat hidden in a corner, patiently waiting to be stirred in. This made for a rich, comforting plate that I really enjoyed, especially when the fine strips of seaweed were mixed in. The pork was smoky, tender, super tasty. Will have this again! Good for sharing too. 
Whoa, that truffle mash was generous, silky-smooth, with a good hit of truffle that\'s thankfully not overpowering yet still satisfying. The chicken meatballs were surprisingly moist and really lovely when eaten with the chorizo sofrito. This may be a little pricey at $23, but I reckon it\'s worth it considering you should share this - it\'s really hearty! Sit by the window if you can, this space is rather nice to be in. 
This coffee was too mild for my liking but the food was pretty good! The staff were friendly, except one and she\'s the reason I wouldn\'t go back to the cafe. It\'s so easy to have a good day/eat out session ruined by just one service staff. Thoroughly regretting my suggestion to try out the cafe.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#PaddyHillsSG #Coffee #MorningCoffee
Missing this Tonkotsu Risotta. So flavourfuland addictive, with the scratchings to give some texture and that melt in the mouth kurobuta pork belly, my life is completed!
It\'s crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Love the yuzu gel vanilla yogurt. 😋
The truffle mash that sits at the most bottom is indeed comforting. 😍 Topped with tsukune (Japanese chicken meatball), chorizo sofrito and a sous vide egg. Pretty good, but just that it\'s a whopping $23. #paddyhills
tender roasted meat, complimented with the sweet pumpkin mash and roasted grapes. \n<br />loved that bunch of grapes.
A beautiful plate of dessert that everyone around the table enjoyed it for both the lunch and dinner menu sharing sessions. I kid you not, this is that good! Fluffy vanilla yogurt that is as soft as a cloud. Besides being pretty, e freeze dried fruits added texture and sweetness to the dessert. Charred pineapple and fresh berries gave the dessert another blast of natural sweetness and different texture. The strawberry crisp that was painstakingly made was good as well. Yum yum to that sweet extra crunchiness. Me likey 😍😍😍\n<br />Thank you @paddyhills.sg for hosting and everyone for coming 😘😘😘
This was taken during yesterday\'s soft launch; @paddyhills.sg newly revamped dinner menu.  Featuring: Roasted Chicken served with romesco, pumpkin puree and roasted grapes. \n<br />#sgeats #paddyhills
Gin Haze, aesthetically pleasing and surprisingly good given that Paddy Hills is a bistro. \n<br />Just like life, if there is a kind of friend that I choose, that will be friends who are REAL. Talking behind me and acting close to me is just too fake. Thanks but no thanks😴😴😴
The month when many F&amp;B outlets have a revamped menu. Looking forward to the rest of the dishes that are coming up for the night. New and revamped menu at  Paddy Hills. Excited!!!! Makan session with like minded peeps always make my day 😻😻😻
I think it\'s just a huge overhyped butter cake :b 
This is probably my 5th time ordering this! The hotcake is so crunchy from the outside and the inside is very very soft and fluffy. The yuzu sauce and berries make sure the hotcake stays moist inside your mouth! Though one of my friends say that it does not taste as good, I personally think of this hotcake as the best pancake I have ever tasted in my life! I truly recommend this menu to all pancake lovers💜\n<br />Taste: 9.5/10\n<br />Presentation: 9/10\n<br />Price: 6/10
This kimchi fried rice is so delicious that you won\'t be able to stop yourself from eating so much! The rice is very good, although it is not the traditional korean taste, I still think they did a really good job. AND THE STEAK💫\n<br />The meat is probably the most best part. My friend and I love eating the rice first and saving the meat for the last. It\'s just so good! The sunny side up is also cooked really well and if you eat all these three in one bite, your mouth will be exploding with happiness in instant! If you are going to Paddy Hills, make sure you order this! It will be your new favourite menu.\n<br />Taste: 9.4/10\n<br />Presentation: 9/10\n<br />Price: 6/10
An extremely delightful experience. We paid $39 for everything here and I would say that it was worth every cent. The berry ricotta hotcake was delectable, the fruits atop it were surprisingly sweet. Might be a little \'gelat\' for one so I highly encourage sharing. Cauliflower Fritters were 💯💯, a unique dish that did not disappoint at all! 
As long as it\'s good food, it will work for any meal of the day. Crispy chicken thigh with a garlicky chilli sauce that packs a good punch of heat, reminiscent of chicken rice chilli sauce. And homemade pasta with uni cream sauce and some fresh, well cooked scallops and prawns. The cup of hot chocolate was pretty darn good as well. \n<br />The only things that made this meal better was great company and soft, magical sunlight. \n<br />Dang I just made myself hungry again. \n<br />#paddyhills #burpple
One of my favourite locations because it\'s cost and secluded. The first time I went, the ricotta hotcakes was quite dry and nothing special.. Special mention goes to the squid ink pasta though, that one is really good
I love seafood and if you want an indulgent taste of the ocean without the heaviness typically associated with rich flavor, this is it.
It could do with a tad more yuzu gel and mascarpone given its size. I\'d recommend this for sharing between two people! I would absolutely order it again. \n<br />Oh and did I mention the gorgeous light flooding this place?!! #paddyhills #burpple
Photogenic but not mind-blowing. I wouldn\'t wait for this if the cafe had a queue. It tasted decent but cake was slightly dry. 
Highly recommend. Portion size was perfect, pasta was creamy, flavorful and not too heavy. 
Creamy tagliatelle packed with umami flavour no doubt thanks to the sea urchin. #fusionasian
Better luck with lunch mains - this kimchi fried rice was pretty amazing and strangely addictive. 
Generous sprinkling of berries but alas the hotcake itself tasted rather bland and dry. Perhaps Melbourne brunch has spoilt me forever. 
Traveling to secluded area for brunch was never my thing in the first place, but I\'m willing to since my guest @daviddepe in town over the weekends.
My paddy hills experience was a great one. The staffs were friendly and accomodating. The food was of quality. The beef was cook to perfection and their salmon was fresh. Their toasted crispy spicy rice cake was a new suprise when you eat it in the yolk and the marimated meat. ($23) Lastly their blue cheese truffle fries ($15/18) were nice. For people who dont take cheese, their offer another alternative which is garlic mayo. But that depends on its availability. The 2 of us were super full at the end of the meal. Our total bill including a refeshing taste like purple ($7) and affogato ($6.50) is about $82 with no service charges.
While the food is definitely good and very photogenic, I\'m not sure if I\'ll queue up to an hour to dine here during peak hour. This kimchi fried rice had a tzechar wokhei taste that i felt overpowered the kimchi a little too much! But the beef was quite tender (although slightly dry). The truffle fries definitely a must try! Visit on weekdays to avoid the crowds. 
I had the kimchi fried rice with steak this time round in Paddy. It was so hearty and delicious, literally worth every single penny for this. Though portion could be a wee bit bigger, but it\'s still so freaking awesome. I had a really yumm hand brewed coffee too. The only disappointment of the meal was that we ordered cauliflower fritters - it came late and it was way too oily for our liking. 
Simple pan fried Seabass with a fantastic creamy sauce. Great design &amp; presentation....
Great show of culinary art.... Taste authentic Korean for the fried rice. However, the beef is a little dry &amp; cold...
Finally Managed to get the car during lunch time only to find out that they changed the menu and the squid ink pasta was no longer on the day time menu. 😱😱 Sorry BFF hahha.. We tried the Uni tagliatelle with scallop and tiger prawn.
beef was tender rice was great but this really isn\'t anything special so I would much rather spend my 20$ on the other things on the menu!! THAT SAID this tasted great!!!!!! I just didn\'t think it was that special 
The noodles were thin and highly slurpable, coated in a sexy dressing that is tangy and slightly spicy. Elsewhere, the calamari is initially addictive with its salty energy but your patience quickly wears thin due to its slowly apparent shallow personality, so it is highly fortunate that mango chunks are in attendance for your refreshment purposes. 4/5 
Food here is overall good. Nice neighborhood joint. Kimchi fried rice is all round favorite. 
🙌 Everything taste so good with company 😊😊😊 Berry Ricotta Hotcakes,  Cauliflower Fritters, Pink Pasta,  Kimchi Fried Rice &amp; Quesadallia - it\'s my first time trying all except the Berry Ricotta Hotcakes. The Quesadallia tasted amazing with the guacamole, along with the air fried cauliflower fritters 😋
Singaporeans really need to Google what it should look like before diggin into this &amp; making a huge hype over something that clearly isn\'t what it should be. This was no better than a fancy butter cake with a miserable amount of ricotta cheese added into the batter, &amp; garnished with fruits; looking artificially pretty. We spoke to a staff about it &amp; he clearly couldn\'t care less about our feedback, replying that no one has ever made a complaint. What kind of attitude is that in the food industry, to not take in constructive criticisms about the food they serve.. So don\'t be fooled. #foodrant #burpple #paddyhills #sgcafe
The creamy tagliatelle was as firm as a lithe yoga practitioner, with watermelon cubes on hand for mouth cleansing if the murky squid ink gets too interfering, while the scallops were happily-sized, with nicely-grilled skin and ever-so-slightly soft cores.  3.9/5 
Link Here or insta profile. ☕️☕️🌾🌾🍃🍃 http://nickeatfood.blogspot.sg/2015/07/review-paddy-hills-at-south-buona-vista.html?m=1
Crispy on the outside and cakey texture inside. Taste so buttery and nice. Love it~
Cooling Ice Coffee to chill out the scrotching sun outside this afternoon... interesting metal straw used by the restaurant.
$20 for this huge portion of pancake! quite worthy as there\'s wide varities of berries... Strawberries, blueberries, cherries, raspberries... loving it... sure come back for their other dishes!
Be impressed by combination of gleefully coloured berries and the thick yet fluffy hotcake - they\'ll leave you craving for more in no time!! Serving size is big and good enough to share with your friends 🙆🏻 Detailed reviews of the café can be found on my blog, www.musingsofarabbit.com 😋💕 #AldoraEats
It\'s so picture perfect! But it didn\'t wow me, it didn\'t substantiate the hoohaa about it. It\'s just like a flat cake topped with berries, some fruit sauce. Yea, the skin of the cake has a light crisp but that\'s all. It\'s definitely worth taking a picture of it. It doesn\'t substantiate the cost tho. Well, that\'s imo. Some people really do love it, so, give it try. You\'ll know! 
I expected a pancake but it turned out to be a really substantial cake, freshly baked, crisp on the outside, sufficiently crumbly inside.  I liked the blobs of lemon gel but didn\'t think they put enough.
Looks like Paddy Hills increased the price of this dish and also altered its presentation. 
Although I was tempted to try their coffee which uses beans from Tiong Hoe, i decided to go for their hot choc.
New found love. My next to go cafe :)
How can anyone miss this? 😍😍😍
Doesn\'t look like much but there are actually 3 pancakes in this stack and it was wayy too much for one person to finish. Highly recommend sharing instead! Pancakes were a little to dense instead of the soft and fluffy type I enjoy. Will stick to the hotcake next time.
Okay I finally understand the hype around this dish!! 😍 loved the crispy exterior of the hotcake contrasting with the warm dense centre. I\'ll be back for this!
Today I ventured out to South Bouna Vista road to try out this new kid on the block, Paddy Hills. To be honest, I was quite excited as I heard raving reviews about this place and how it\'s super instaworthy and the fusion food menu that they have to offer. I ordered their signature berry ricotta hotcake and a cup of flat white to go along with it. The hotcake made me went OMG at first sight and it was good, but I got quite jelak thereafter. Definitely for sharing, you can\'t finish this alone. The flat white was average to me. I would definitely consider coming back to try their mains (and with more friends!) and with the SMRT Citibank credit card you\'ll get 10% off your bill too! :)
Ridiculously photogenic and reminiscent of brunches in Sydney, Paddy Hills is a rustic the even though located in the far West. The hotcake is done very well and berries were really fresh and juicy. Please order this and others for sharing as portions are huge.
Completely understand the hype surrounding Paddy Hills and their exquisite Berry Ricotta Hotcakes. Yes, it was so so worth it and more!!! Easily the best hotcakes I\'ve ever had, very worth the walk. Squid Ink was fantastic too. Do give the Fried Kimchi Hotcakes a miss though. Ambience, food were all amazing, what a treat!
The berries pancake, kimchi rice and rice cakes are damn awesome! It\'s a must try for these 3 dishes when u are there! 
Slightly crispy on the outer with a chewy texture. The dipping sauce was good and was very addictive!
These awesome trio Mantou with beef patty,  cheese and sweet potato fries were really great! Buns were crispy n fragrant and beef was juicy and tender.  Worth to get if going in groups to minimise $23 burn in the wallets. 😊🍴
Monday seems happier now like this colorfully plated Berries Ricotta Hotcake from #paddyhillssg. 
Orange ricotta pillows $18\n<br />pancake was too cakey , too thick and too dry - sauce didn\'t help (tasted like digested orangina)\n<br />could not taste any ricotta
This is where all hipsters gather on weekends recently and so my friends and I decided to join the crowd. The 1 hour queue was totally worth it! The kimchi fried rice with onsen egg and beef was perfectly executed even I could finish the whole portion by myself. When we saw grapefruit drink on other tables we totally went for it too. The rise and grind has a bitter aftertaste and we thought that we could not taste any yoghurt in it, but it was still a refreshing drink nonetheless.
- Golden man tou sliders [$23]: Meatballs sandwiched between crispy man tous with a side of barbecue sauce and sweet potato chips. Absolutely delicious and beats your average burger sliders hands down. The sweet potato chips were really addictive and went very well with the barbecue sauce!
Anyway, the bowl is really huge. It is perhaps prepared for dinosaurs, and I am very fond of  the taste of lamb meatballs and potatoes mashed up altogether with egg!
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Café Hopping
Brought my wife here as we\'re really into trying new places. Was super excited when we saw it cos it\'s in a little cozy corner with awesome an interior. 
Fluffy and eggy textures going well with the cheese. Generous portion of berries as well which were decently sweet to go with the plain ordinary hotcake. Oso makes the dish aesthetically for instagram\'s FOTD.😉👍

Love that the crushed pistachio added the extra crunch. Not a fan of mousse but this can be quite addictive! Every mouthful felt like a sip of earl grey tea, cooling and very smoothing in this hot weather. Compliments from the boss, thank you.
Dinner isn\'t as crowded as expected so food came pretty fast! Was disappointed with the lobster somen, the dish was warm instead of hot when served. Stack &amp; stack isn\'t too bad!
My siblings and i loved this inventive dish topped with nori flakes. The cauliflowers were hot, crisp, and not too oily. Great when paired with the spiced yogurt dip. Highly addictive!
Having heard of this dish, I have bemoaned about the price and the portion - who would pay 20 bucks for a plate of fried rice and chicken? Today I realised why Paddy Hills would even dare to serve up this dish at such a price. 
Featuring a pair of yuzu sorbet and earl grey iced lollies. Both the lollies were tasty and made for an interesting experience with the contrasting tastes of sour and sweet. The pistachios and the almonds with its added nuttiness and crunchiness gave the dish more depth. However, I felt that the yuzu sorbet was too soft, and the earl grey was too hard. I also didn\'t favour the vanilla foam which tasted strikingly like whipped cream as it was very airy. In terms of price, 8 bucks per iced-lolly is pretty expensive. I think I would get a nice magnum stick at half the price. 
Three words. Orange. Ricotta. Pillows. Except when they said orange maybe they meant orange and grapefruit. The pancakes came as puffy, airy and pillow-y as can be, stuffed full with tangy ricotta, sitting in a puddle of gooey, marmalade-y goodness of golden orange syrup. In the corner sits a scoop of coconut ice cream - though it doesn\'t match up to the legends you\'d find at Chatuchak, it was creamy, decadent and flavourful, balancing the acidity of the orange well. I liked this. I\'m not sure if many others would. Definitely \"on fleek\". Am i basic yet?
Bruleé french toast puffs, purple sweet potato stumps, goreng pisang, butternut squash pureé, yam ice cream.. The list of components goes on - i proclaim this Asian-approved. Surprisingly, every component was well-executed, so.. Can i say it\'s \"on fleek\"?
Garnished with ikura, tobiko and scallops. I can\'t say i thought very much of this dish. The tagliatelle was underdone and had too much bite. I\'ve also never been a big fan of squid ink - it adds little flavour or texture, and God forbid you ever order it on a romantic first date! Overall, we were left underwhelmed and the pasta was left languishing in the corner.
Post-exams celebration with this very pretty berry ricotta hot cakes. It had us going OMG with the first few bites (or was it just me hahaha). Crispy at the sides - loved the caramelisation, fluffy and crumbly inside with maple syrup and bits of hidden blueberries and mascarpone!!! Garnished with edible (petals) flowers.🌼 the portion was quite big though. 
Not fascinated by the rice crisps but I like the pulled pork. And the very refreshing pinkish lemonade.
Goma, nori, gochujang mayo &amp; shaved cured egg yolk - pretty addictive. But eh got tired of chewing, portion is huge. This and the hot cake proved to be an overkill for both of us.
slight crisp on the outside edges and fluffy on the inside, just how I like it! Will prefer if it has a scoop of icecream on it! :p
And those mini buns got us confused for a second for it differs from our assumption of what brioche should look like. The taro ice cream is really yammy. #socorny 😋. #burpple
A good and hearty beverage, Paddy Hills\' Peanut butter, Chocolate &amp; Banana milkshake is made for sharing (rather pricey at $11) ! The huge cup of milkshake is of a dense and thick creamy consistency, topped with torched marshmallows and chocolate sauce~ Definitely one of the better milkshakes!
Seared sea bass on thinly-shredded potato rosti with sauteed mushrooms and fried egg, Paddy Hills\' Potato &amp; Fish I believe is a rather well executed dish. The rosti was crisp and together will the sea bass, mushroom and egg the flavours worked well however the anchovy at the side made some parts of the sauce a little too fishy.
Summer is here! Not only good to look at, I have to say Paddy Hills\' grub surpassed my expectations. Having heard that the service could be bad and quite slow, my friends and I were prepared for the wait but turns out it was much faster than the informed 50 minutes ! The hotcake was fluffy, with generous chunks of ricotta and crispy on the outside! It was like a garden party on a plate~
Absolutely love this dish! Beef so tender, mantou was perfect and I love love love the crisps!
Features an assortment of items, including the usual eggs on toast, salmon, and avocado spread. However, the slab of Western-style sio bak (roast pork belly) in bbq sauce was incredibly tasty! A unique twist to an otherwise predictable breakfast platter
Feels like half clams half noodles ratio for me,really generous amount of clams. It is then cooked with shaved truffles, garlic chip and sake to bring out the aromatic fragrant. Personally would like the pasta to be more al dante, as the noodles were on the softer side. \n<br />However, yet another agreeable photogenic dish from paddy hills, all thanks to the brilliant natural light there! 😊
Really reminiscing this smooth latte from paddy hills with their tall turquoise cup.
Boasting a medley of premium ingredients, such as pan-seared scallops, mentaiko and ikura, the Squid Ink Tagliatelle is an impressive work of fusion cuisine
Big breakfast, Berry Ricotta Hotcakes, Peanut butter, banana and chocolate milkshake and Latte.
This pancakes are gaspingly instagram worthly, yet delicious at the same time, pack with surprises. The exterior was crisp yet super fluffy inside and generously littered with berries on top.
💯💯💯 will visit again. #notetoself to not order the Asian Brick though (too much carbssss) 
Yes this is the sort of signature dish which elevates Paddy Hills above its competitors, and I\'m glad to say it lives up to the hype #nofilter
Interesting textures in the Asian Brick, a carbful dish consisting of brioche, sweet potatoes, yam, pumpkin and banana! 😱😱😱 gonna work it off in class today. I guess I have to do 3h today to burn all of that. #eatnowregretlater #trainhard
Orange Ricotta Pillows indeed! Possibly the fluffiest nommiest pancakes I\'ve ever tried. And the coconut ice cream - absolutely gorgeous. Citrus fans would adore the accompanying orange sauce. So so yummy 😍
This cauliflower fritters were pretty good but you might feel a little greasy.
A very unique dessert - summer dish. Ingredients: coconut sago, chia seed, mango purée &amp; sweet potato balls. Thumb up for this. Really so good.
The lobster somen. Plain clear soup with flat noodles that Contains the baby lobster and scallops for dinner. 
On a rare occasion that I got the car I managed to have time to check out the nearby Paddy Hills before lecture 😬 and there was no doubt to what I was gonna try - the Berry Ricotta Hotcakes - their hot favourite. It was a rather quiet morning but the hotcakes still took about half an hour to prepare. 
We had Quesadillas ($18) which had delicious BBQ pulled pork with charred corn and roasted peppers, The Asian Brick ($18) which is an array of food. The goreng pisang, butternut squash purée sweet potato plus my favorite yam ice cream. The iced latte ($6.50) and iced mocha ($7.50) however were just average.
Juicy chunks of fried chicken. Crispy fried chicken skin. A sous vide egg sexily spewing molten yolk. Crunchy garlic chips. Fried rice redolent with the alluring pungency of garlic.
Interesting how different roes add to that smokey flavour. Would be perfect if the noodles were consistent, and the sauce was a tad creamier and smoother.
Can\'t seem to get this outta my mind 😢
Amazing fries, lousy truffle fries 😖 could barely get any hint of truffle. Love the sage, and surprisingly the aioli which was creamy, light, and pleasantly tangy.
I couldn\'t resist all the hotcakes madness, so we finally made a trip down! Can\'t say the same for everything else, but this hotcakes was 👍👍👍😋😍❤❤❤ crisp and caramelized on the outside, and so much cakey goodness inside. Would\'ve loved a touch of lavendar syrup.
Compliments from the boss, thank you ☺️ -
Super big and pretty serving of hotcakes topped with an assortment of berries!
Most places aka cafes will just cut and throw in the grapefruit, who would actually burnt it to give that extra omppp Impact to the presentation. How can you go wrong with #yuzu and #ume . Just feel that they need to tone down a little for that vanilla essence. #drink #cafesg #cafe #burrple
creamy mash, lamb meatballs, cauliflower fritters, polenta chips, crumbled manchego &amp; sous vide egg
after half an hour of waiting for the hotcake, they serve me a garden of eden instead. damn, just how exactly do you eat a picturesque garden, you tell me? fluffy fluffy bed of maple syrup doused hotcake with nice crisp lining and zealous hills of ricotta cheese. spurting from the hotcake is a botanic landscape of freshest blackcurrants, medley of berries and litters of daintiest edible flowers, roasted pine nuts and a cloud of mascarpone. o careful the knife there, you are hurting the darling you know.
A little too rich for my taste. The one at maxwell still the best!
i learnt the weapon of choice from jimmy monkey and that is with a slayer machine. i learnt the craftsmen who lives and breathes coffee for two generations are from tiong hoe. so when you have these two assets at paddy hills, you make sure you serve one bloody good cup of coffee. and so my flat white came out the way i always like on a perfect note: distinct crema tans, coffee edging over milk and full good body. aghhh. what a way to welcome the long weekend.
cauliflower fritters with paprika salt and masala yogurt. disclaimer: veggie haters stay clear. may convert after this. cauliflower was crisp and perfectly seasoned in paprika salt to retain that tinge of cauli sweetness. masala yogurt dip gives a lovely sweet tang and sprinkle of seaweed adds another dimension to taste. perfecto starter.
There\'s mango puree, coconut sago &amp; jelly, and sweet potato balls!! 😋😋
When i see the neighbour table order this, I immediately say I want this too!!
And it contains my favourites too, Goreng Pisang and Taro Ice Cream. 😍
I was expecting fluffy pancakes but it\'s literally hot cake, pound cake that was served warm. 😅 Kinda misleading to the name of this dish. But still, it tasted not bad, loved all the fresh berries.
Back here to try the dinner menu – it\'s certainly geared more toward Asian flavours, whereas the brunch/lunch menu is more typical of modern Aussie eclecticism.
Sprucing up the dining scene in the Buona Vista area is Paddy Hills, a beautiful space that should be high up on your list of places to visit. The menu is  diverse and refreshing, with a fusion of several cuisines. A feast for the eyes, the Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($19) is served with mascarpone, blueberry sugar and fresh berries, inspired by Melbourne\'s Top Paddock. A crisp exterior gives in to a fluffy interior tinged with maple syrup — a must-order dish that tastes a lot more cake-like than the usual hotcakes. The Japanese-inspired Squid Ink Tagliatalle ($23) features tobiko, ikura, mentaiko, puffed rice, and seared scallops. Also order the Cauliflower Fritters ($12) served with masala yogurt, and the Toasted Spicy Rice Cakes ($15) with gochujang mayo to snack on. Besides the usual coffee and tea, they have cocktails, ciders and wines as well.
The sous vide egg elevates the dish further and I am hooked. Fried chicken skin is thin, crispy and delicious. Would I pay $20 for this? I SAID just take my money!
(19.00) The cafe was so pretty and the wall outside was so cute! The hotcake too almost 30mins to come (my friend order Hash Hash which came first). The hotcake was beautiful, and has ricotta and fruits embedded in the hotcake itself.\n<br />However, I don\'t think it is worth $19 as the size was smaller than expected and the taste isn\'t impressive. May be back to try the dinner menu.
It\'s gorgeous, and it instantly puts a smile on one\'s face. More than Instagram-worthy, it\'s pretty darn good too.
Also, why would anyone not order breakfast food for lunch. This berry ricotta hotcake is basically a maple syrup infused cake pillow with a cute garden to show off😍
Super fresh and awesome! The noodles are also super chewy! One of my favourite dish from paddy hills. Gonna go head over soon for their dinner menu the next time round
It\'s more of sponge cake rather than Hotcake to me but still it\'s good 👍 For this, it\'s either you like it or not - nth in the middle.
TGIW
【 EARL GREY LOLLIES S$16 】not quite a lollipop or a popsicle, it\'s like a mousse pudding made up of earl grey lolly (love the significant Earl grey 😍), vanilla foam, raspberry dust, crushed pistachios and sea salt caramel Marcona almonds. 
Taking over the space previously occupied by the legendary Lim Seng Lee Duck Rice at South Buona Vista Road, Australian-style Paddy Hills serves cafe food in the day, and Asian-inspired small plates after 5.30pm. There is a strong fusion aspect to their offerings which aim to surprise the tastebuds, as seen in their intriguing Cauliflower Fritters with paprika salt and masala yogurt ($12). For brunch, share their gorgeous Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($19) — a huge, fluffy, crisp cake that\'s topped with berries, mascarpone, berry sugar and beautiful edible flowers. Also go for their Squid Ink Tagliatelle ($23), a Japanese fusion dish topped with ever-so-lightly seared scallops. For dinner, select from their wide array of yakitoris and share their Golden Man Tou Sliders ($23)!
It\'s a pity the coffee beans served at Paddy Hills isn\'t to my liking.
And then Paddy Hills decide to challenge it. Unfortunately it\'s a little flatter &amp; tougher to bite - and obviously not as colourful. I\'d try the Orange Ricotta Pillows in future though!
Trying out Paddy Hills which has been getting a lot of buzz.  A little disappointed that they changed the kitchen closing time 5.00pm instead of 5.30pm as stated, especially since it\'s not the most convenient place to get to.
Too thick, taste like the Chinese egg cupcake. Nothing like the ricotta pancake at Skype 
Not just a pretty pancake but tasty as well! It was a single, thick pancake that was deliciously fluffy and sprinkled with edible flowers. A cafe that I would love to come back to! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
The ricotta Hotcakes tasted good but felt that the Hotcakes were very gilat overtime and it would be better to mix the mascarpone and fruits together with the Hotcakes. Mantou sliders was an interesting rendition to Asian fusion food and it went really well with the beef patty which tasted like wagyu :) 
House-cured slices of buttery salmon plated with cream cheese, rice crisp clusters, bubbles of yuzu \"caviar\", baby radish, fried capers and pickled wakame.
Here at the closed door event and I am horrified to hear about how a fellow blogger scolded the service crew here \"stupid\" on one of those busy days. 😨😨😨
Favourite dish! I loooove squid ink and this was just so good. The fresh scallops and addition of puffed rice, tobiko and ikura gave the overall dish a very nice texture. One more plate please!
Crumpled ribbons of homemade tagliatelle made fresh in the morning, inked and stained with salty squid ink – I thought I tasted a hint of cheese in the first few mouthfuls, but it disappeared after that. Be sure to mix the three types of fish roe (ikura, tobiko and mentaiko) and crispy flour pops into the pasta so you get different layers of saltiness and textures in every bite.
THIS. IS. DA. BOMB. Its crisp exterior glazed with homemade dehydrated blueberry sugar belies its thick, cushiony texture inside that veers toward an actual cake. Its plush crumb, studded and stained with blueberries and their juice, is moist and somehow manages to be dense yet fluffy simultaneously.
a tad dry but was otherwise very satisfying. \n<br />on another note, not for the impatient hearted for the wait to our food took almost an hour. I heard someone wait for an hour and half before finally bailing out.
Paddy Hills has an eclectic menu of comforting egg dishes for either breakfast, lunch and dinner. You will be surprised to find sous vide eggs in over 8 dishes, one of which is the braised lamb balls with crumbled feta, croutons, and sous vide egg on the night time menu is good for sharing.
I liked the fresh colourful berries and mascarpone. Wasn\'t really something I expected but it was still good! I would say to share this though.
Kimchi Fried Rice ($20) - I don\'t eat beef so I\'m not sure but the kimchi rice was yummy! Pricey though. 
With thyme, pomegranate and rose water, this was super refreshing and tasty! 
This dish was made perfect with its sweetness and a tinge of saltiness from the ikura and tobiko. A crisp to it from the puffed rice. But it gets a tad too overwhelming after a few mouthfuls because of the ink.
Inspired by the owner\'s trips to Top Paddock in Australia, the Berry Ricotta Hotcake is made to replicate a similar dish that is being served there. Beautifully plated with berries, mascarpone and berry sugar, not only is the dish pretty to look at and Instagram-worthy, it delivers and tastes different from the usual hotcakes we have. For a start, the Ricotta hotcake is crisp on the outside but manages to stay cake-like and fluffy inside, with a tinge of sweetness because the batter is already infused with maple syrup. Add the tart berries and that smooth whipped mascarpone, it brings the summery vibes which are just comforting and luxurious to have. Best to be shared amongst two because it can get a bit heavy halfway through.
Behind the scene of the golden mantou stuffed with pork belly and lamb patty.
This is Chick n\' Egg garlic rice with fried chicken and garlic chicken skin. Who says west is boring now.
[$18] Soft, fluffy pancakes topped with generous amount of sliced grapefruits and coconut ice cream, this definitely is the perfect dish to end off a typical long hectic day any Singaporean would have had. 😌🍴 -♠️
From Paddy Hills at 38 South Buona Vista Road. Think of this as a baked eggs meets beef stew dish that comes with all sort of goodies from beef shank, chorizo, sautéed mushrooms and potatoes. The stew gets quite overwhelming halfway through for it only gets more savoury as time goes by, but overall you get a good combination of savoury and tangy flavours with a runny egg yolk. Walnut Toasts were crusty but had the tension in the centre when chewed; pretty satisfying. A tip: mix the hash at the start or the condiments feel like as though they are just taking their own respective areas they are assigned to.
From Paddy Hills at 38 South Buona Vista Road. Air-fried Cauliflower Florets that are crisp and seasoned in paprika salt for a savoury flavour. Masala Yogurt dip gave it a sweet tang.
From Paddy Hills at 38 South Buona Vista Road. Squid Ink Tagliatelle was pretty flavourful with the squid ink being thick and creamy; full of savoury flavour. Scallops were fresh, while the Ikura gives it a refreshing twist by injecting a umami flavour the roe breaks upon each bite. Can be a tad overwhelming for one to finish.
From Paddy Hills at 38 South Buona Vista Road. Paddy Hills uses two blends that is specially roasted for them by Tiong Hoe Specialty Coffee. This should be the Spark blend which has berry notes in its flavour, which is bright and fruity without leaving an aftertaste despite its size that seemed a tad strong.
😏\n<br />The coffee bean ain\'t gonna grind and start brewing by itself. 😎
Made using beans from Tiong Hoe Specialty Coffee and tweaked to give it a more chocolatey flavor, the Flat White ($5.50) is full bodied without being too acidic and tasting slightly chocolatey as well!
Disappointing dish. This came 1hr 10min after we arrived and it was undercooked ie rice was still hard. We sent it back and the second time was fine, yet not very tasty. My friend finished all the prawns but left the rice untouched. As a sign of goodwill, they gave as complimentary drinks. I would strongly recommend the chicken main course. The beef was yummy but not what accompanied it.
($28). Short and succinct. Wagyu rump, beef noodles (not sure what that means), shimeiji ajitsuke tomago, charred romaine and 22hr beef broth. The beef was beautiful. Noodles were sticky to taste, with the flavour of the noodles diffused into the soup (not in a nice way). The beef makes me keen to try their other beef dishes.
Chick N\' Eggs ($20). Garlic fried rice, fried chicken, garlic chips, chicken skin and sous vide egg. Food is really delicious but wait is getting ridiculous.
Their plates are really big though! Lightning here is pretty good too
@paddyhills.sg is a place where visually pleasing food doesnt compromise with the taste. Looking at the ingredients used, the food preparation process and plating, I am having a hard time calling it a cafe as the standard of the food looks more like a restaurant standard one to me. \n<br />Check out my review on my blog now 😊
I can do with all of these refreshing yummilious healthy thirst quenchers now!!!! @paddyhills.sg is opening tomolo from 8.30am!!! R u as excited as me?\n<br />Review is on my blog now!
One of my fav is this toasted spicy rice cakes ($15). Very unique concept. And best of all, great natural lighting!!!\n<br />@paddyhills.sg\n<br />Is opening on this Tue, 3rd March at 38 south buona vista road where the famous braised duck rice used to be located. \n<br />#nofilter
😍Squid Ink rice, 150g flap meat and an onsen egg. Steak was flavourful and medium rare but what blown me away was the squid ink rice which had a nice charred taste (wok hei)! 👍🏻😋\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #sgfoodie #eathealthy #burpple  #sgbrunch #brunch  #8dayseat #steak #beef #onsenegg #newyear #2018 #sgcafe #sgcafehop

A marriage between cupcake and muffin. Berries, yogurt balls and vanilla ice cream.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Crisp on the outside but atad dry and crumbly inside. Yogurt and ice cream on the same plate. Sweet and sour flavors resembling a tango dance on my palate. Preferred more ice cream than yogurt.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />An half hour wait for this. See the christmas tree? It is edible. Made of sugar. We did not eat it because it was too hard. At least it looked cute.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Thank you @jellymagically @rain498 my lovely handmodels who did not know I shot this.
The signature plated dessert @paddyhills.sg . A cross breed between cupcake and muffin.\n<br />.\n<br />The muffcake is crisp, crumbly with a touch sweetness. It is served with different berries, compote, yoghurt balls and vanilla ice cream.\n<br />.\n<br />If you try to put together all the components in one bite, it feels like party in your mouth. #yummy .\n<br />.\n<br />I just wish there were more ice cream, maybe about 3 or 4 cubes instead of 2.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #huffposttaste #nomnom #STfoodtrending #paddyhillssg #muffcake #muffcakes #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe
A fusion dish that confused my palate. Squid ink spaghetti, tossed in uni, parma ham and shaved truffles. It is either you love it or hate it.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Considering the cafe is located in the west amongst shophouses, this $35 dish alone is a heavy price to pay.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Bonding over brunch with favorite foodies coupled with conversation and laughter is priceless.
◾◾\n<br />Snacking!! Thanks to @tiara_star for buying tau sar piah from Loong Fatt for us. Fresh, sweet and warm... just got out from the oven.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Snippets from our mini hop today. Thank you @thearcticstar my lovely handmodel who was not aware I shot this.
◾◽\n<br />Lotus root chips, thinly sliced sprinkled with sumac powder. Not crisp enough and honestly, my tastebuds was bored. Dipping into chilli sauce which I requested became a seasoning of sorts.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />A Saturday eatout with favorite foodies.
One of the better affogato I’ve had
(S$25) 🦀🦀🦀🧀🧀🧀\n<br />Soft shell crab and Mac N Cheese in between squid ink croissant, served with house smoked salmon and bubbles.

With a tangy tomato base, the risotto is very appetizing and won\'t leave you in a queasy state towards the end of the meal. The additional dollops of pickled lemon purée brings a refreshing touch with each spoonful.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Paddy Hills\n<br />Address: 38, South Buona Vista Road, Singapore 118164\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #paddyhills
Albeit the price, what you are getting is a whole shell of fresh Hokkaido scallop that is almost the size of your palm with some drizzle of soy sauce and garnished with pickled black fungus. Just a wild guess but I think there\'s some chilli oil added into it too?\n<br />_________________\n<br />Paddy Hills\n<br />Address: 38, South Buona Vista Road, Singapore 118164\n<br />•\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #paddyhills
House cured bacon, kimchi, melted orange cheddar and mozarella in between Danish loaf.  The Danish loaf was buttery and crispy with croissant-like texture. They served it with two onsen eggs in thin kimchi sauce which was so good.

P.S. I\'m sick of my colleagues\' faces. National day still need to see them.
But why do they remove the fried cutlet option from my favourite 黑rice? 😭 I miss my marinated cripsy chicken to go with this full of wok-hei (fried wok) squidink rice leh.\n<br />.\n<br />#paddyhills #flatlay #onthetable #handsinframe

You are actually supposed to break apart the sous vide egg and let its glorious contents flow exuberantly on to the squid ink rice that is delightfully drizzled with the tangy mentaiko mayo.\n<br />Stir all these together with the delish grilled chicken and you have a scrumptious dish which can bring lots of glee to your tastebuds with its assortment of distinct flavours

It was off the menu but the chefs were able to prepare it for us at our request.

Guess who\'s heading there this weekend? See you when I do! Don\'t be a stranger ☹️
Dainty angel hair pasta with scallops and shrimps. So much flavours from the shrimps! The black autumn truffle makes the whole dish aromatic and irresistible. This is part of the new dinner menu which features a slew of dishes with truffle. Truffle stock is limited so if you are a truffle lover, do head down soon!
Ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry.
If this isnt indulgence, i certainly don\'t know what is. Never ceased to be impressed by the food that they put out.
Ramen risotto and Gardens of Eden are distinct on their own too.\n<br />.\n<br />Just download @holler.out app and enter promo code \'choyalicious\' to take $5 off the bill when you spend min $50! 😍\n<br />.\n<br />Midweek sounds much better already.\n<br />.\n<br />#paddyhills #hollerout #onethetable #flatlays #sgcafefood

Nestled beneath a thin sheet of seaweed (with a raw quail yolk and tonkotsu snow) was pickled shimeiji and tender kurobuta pork slices on creamy (very UMAMI) ramen risotto ($25). Get this whenever you\'re craving tonkotsu ramen and rice at the same time and you\'re in for a hearty, satisfying meal!!!
Absolutely adored the 黑 rice ($22) - garlicky squid ink rice topped with mentaiko mayo and a break-it-yourself sous vide egg, that complemented the crispy &amp; flavourful PH fried chicken cutlet on the side. A must-order!
Ive always heard how good the food was at PH, but the price here was just a ridiculously huge barrier for me. But here it is. Al dente Rigatoni pasta nicely and intricately plated, Cacio e Pepe styled (cheese and pepper) with brazillian sausage, topped with cheesy flakes and nicely grilled lard, and finished with smears of Mentaiko around the sides of the plates.
Don\'t say I Bojio. Come on by to check out their new menu!
Hands down the best truffle fries ever.a must-try!!
Yey or nay?\n<br />As much as I love chocolate, it has an acquired taste when paired with spaghetti! \n<br />Not something your food memory or mouth is familiar with.

好看不好吃 ☹️ so disappointed with this dish! It is not pillowy soft nor it is moist. I don\'t know. So confused with this muffin cake dish. Too crumbly for a muffin and definitely not a yummy cake. Maybe just not my type of dish. #sorry.
You know they take their food very seriously when almost all of their ingredients are prepared in-house with pride, including the hand-kneaded and pulled herbed pappardelle. There\'s even a surprise element inside their homemade meatballs as they have added in a piece of foie gras for that added luxurious touch and flavour. A sous vide egg yolk lies hidden amidst the sea of pecorino cheese completed this excellent and affordable pasta dish.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @paddyhills.sg for hosting and @veronicaphua for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Paddy Hills\n<br />Address: 38, South Buona Vista Road, Singapore 118164 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood  #cafehopping #cafesg #paddyhills #pasta
We got off to an awesome start with the Scallop Ceviche ($19) paired with squid ink cracker, miso, slaw and oyster mushroom. The meaty texture of the scallops plays a very cohesive role with the crispy cracker.

Orange-infused drinks, black squid ink mains and pink dessert.\n<br />Drinks were sparkling grapefruit orange lemon and cold brew Lintong coffee, both distinct in their own ways.\n<br />Black rice with crispy chicken was smokey good, squid ink bun crab roll was refreshingly flavourful.\n<br />Pink cheesecake at the end was a pleasant surprise.

Squid ink risotto ($28+) REALLY reluctant to post this nor recall this dish. The only word suitable for this dish is ewwww!\n<br />Risotto &amp; salmon super duper salty.  Pop balls inside dish?! Vermicelli wasn\'t fried properly, &amp; doesn\'t even match well with the sauce. Even my nonpicky eater friend also rejected eating this.\n<br />2

One of the items on their new menu, the PH Chicken Roll ($26++). It\'s chicken roulade on a squid ink bun, with black bean mayo, kimchi slaw and unagi fries. The unagi fries was brillant IMO, because they make a better protein to carb ratio for my meal 😁. Chicken roulade still had the skin on which I guess will be okay for most people, but I don\'t like chicken skin so I removed it. The black bean mayo was quite strong tasting, but the magic to this dish was the super crispy unagi fries and the sauce there, which tasted like some sort of curry sauce concoction. The sauce was kind of sweet and the savoury unagi just meshed so well with the sauce. The kimchi slaw was quite well done too. I will totally be back here. Again! .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cafehopping #sgcafehop #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood #instafood_sg #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgmakandiary #burpple #ASandHP #reversedieting #eatoutsg #chickenroulade #cafelife #cafehoppingsg #whati8today #paddyhills #brunch #iifym

This 黑 Rice ($22++) come with a sous vide egg that is still intact in the shell. Yep, this is my actual breakfast today. 🤗\n<br />🔸\n<br />The PH fried chicken is really good, very tasty, skin is still crispy while maintaining the moistness of the chicken. It tastes so much like they used har cheong gai marinate. While the squid ink rice is cooked well, very flavourful &amp; full of chicken slices inside the rice. Both the chicken &amp; rice are given generously. Would recommend to have a go at this dish if you are here.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Paddy Hills\n<br />38 South Buona Vista Road\n<br />Weekdays 1030am-10pm\n<br />Weekend 9am-10pm\n<br />🔸\n<br />🔸\n<br />🔸\n<br />#paddyhillssg #cafesg #sgcafe #cafehoppingsg #sgbrunch #sgbreakfast #foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia #foodiegram #burpple #sgfoodie #sgfood #stfoodtrending #instafood_sg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #sgfooddiary #sgmakandiary #igsg #topcitybites #nomsterofficial #city_noms #singaporeliciouz

Imagine the yummy Kenny Rogers sweet corn muffin (without the corn) in pancake form. \n<br />The crusty layer outside was a delighting alternative to that of pancake while still retaining the fluffiness within. Complemented with ice cream, generous serving of mixed berries and flower petals, it was visually attractive and balanced in taste. \n<br />My suggestion would be to share as the 2 big muffcakes might be too much for a person. #burpple  #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #pancakes #bupplesg
Taste was rich but not \"jelat\", texture and consistency of the risotto were good. Portion wasn\'t big but they were generous with the Char Siew, and loved the crispy pork skin too. Think they totally killed this \"death dish\" and that it\'s worth the trip here.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #foodporn #sgfoodies #singaporefood #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodspotting #sgfoodunion #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instasg #instafoodsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies

It\'s made up of creamy mash potatoes, tsukune in some sort of tomato based sauce, sous vide egg and vegetables. I loved the tender tsukune. It\'s quite unique to have chicken meatballs in tomato sauce instead of beef or lamb, but the flavours still worked.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#paddyhillssg #sgcafehop #sgcafes #sgcafe #cafehopping #cafelife #instafood_sg #sgfoodie #burpple #ASandHP #reversedieting #tsukune #fusioncuisine #brunch #sgcafefood
I love every part of this dish. The poached eggs were perfectly made, the stewed beans were made in a delicious tangy tomato sauce, the beans were still firm and not mushy like canned beans, and the focaccia was toasty and crisp.

Another dish off Paddy Hill\'s yet to be launched menu from the Tasty Tastemaker Tour, this dish is inspired by Cacio e Pepe, which is a minimalist pasta dish that literally translates to \"Cheese and Pepper\". The Rigatoni also adds a mentaiko sauce and a little meat at the side. Flavours are strong here, especially since it is mainly powered by the cheese and pepper around the pasta which was done pretty decent, though I wished that the mentaiko had a chance to shine alongside the main characters as well — perhaps this is the reason people call me a biased mentaiko fan haha.
Sunday Bliss! Happy to enjoy this yummy Berry Ricotta Hotcake @paddyhills.sg with the sweetheart @xitharcane 🍴❤️👫 and indulge in good conversations.
200g of medium rare Striploin, with garlic-infused mustard sauce ($27). I found the meat to be slightly tough, wished it could have been more tender. Nevertheless, it was seasoned simply with salt and pepper to bring out the natural flavours and juices of the red meat. Would recommend to fellow meat-eaters looking for an affordable steak and a lovely, quiet ambience to dine at.
My experience on this Sunday morning was one of the worst I\'ve ever had in my life. 
This is how all Fridays should be like! Berry Ricotta Hotcake @paddyhills.sg - A thick and fluffy pancake, that was moist and dense on the inside and crispy at the edges. I love the spread of fruits and drizzle of mascarpone and maple sauce too! It\'s pricey at $23 but oh so worth it!
Happy Labour day everybody :)

at a glance it seems quite little but it\'s actually quite filling. they have other mains like tonkotsu risotto and ramen as well. something off the menu can be found on the wall like green pasta. seems like they have lots of jap influenced dishes on the lunch menu. always nice to find new food item on the menu or tweaked every visit so that customers don\'t get bored ^^!.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sg#singapore#burpple#burpplesg#sgig#sgcafe#cafesg#exploresingapore#sgcafefood#food#foodporn#sgfood#foodie#instafood#yummy#yum#instagood#delicious#foodpics#eat#delicious#peanutloti#tasty#dinner#foodpic#eating#sgfoodies#foodgram#foodspotting#foodphotography#foodstagram

The salmon is glazed with saikyo miso for hints of sweetness. Topped with seasoned quinoa, giving it a delectable crust. Complementing the flaky and pinkish salmon is the pumpkin puree, baby eel cracker and seasonal greens.
The kimchi fried rice comes with slices of beef steak as well as a sous vide egg. The flavours are spot on and enjoyable. My disappointment is that the fried rice is on the wet side.
Saying that, it\'s only 2 more days to weekend. Hang in there. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #coffee #latte #paddyhills

Highly recommended! 
It was amazing.. I really liked it😊👍🏻
Dish of risotto with seafood. Ingredients are pretty fresh. Overall: Tasteful! It takes at least 20 mins to be ready, but as the saying goes: \"Good things must wait leh\"
Beef melts in your mouth... I would say the portion of beef is pretty generous. As for the sauce and pasta, it\'s just right to match the beef. It is garnished with blue cheese and smells/taste really good after mixing it in! This is my fav dinner dish at the hills!

It\'s really nice to meet you, sorry that I have to leave so soon, hope you have enjoyed your stay in singapore.
Everything\'s good but sadly it has increased 4 bucks since the last time I had them. I don\'t know if this Berry Ricotta Hotcake is actually worth my 23 bucks now. 😕
Never thought pancakes could be this delicious! The crispy crust coupled with the acidity from the strawberries and blueberries go very well together. The texture was also crunchy on the outside yet soft inside which is really what I look for in a pancake! It was also a very attractive looking plate which was what caught our eye in the first place! Price was a little steep though but well worth it😋😋😋 #cafehoppingpiggies #BurppleCafeMonth  #whati8day #sgfood  #tslmakan #cafesg #exploresingapore  #igsg #sgfoodie #onthetable #sgfoodsnaps #burpple #burpplesg

⋅\n<br />That being said… don\'t expect anything mind-blowing. I don\'t find this any better than any of the other Berry Ricotta Hotcakes around. The edges were crisp and buttery, but the inside was dry and crumbly. Personally I\'d rather more fresh berries and syrup and less of the actual hotcake, but worth a try if you\'re at Paddy Hills.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#PaddyHillsSG #HotCakes

Almost reminiscent of the French Cassoulet except it\'s made with beef and flavoured a bit differently.  It\'s a nice spin off of the traditional French dish.  Dip the bread in the sauce to clean the dish off all the sauce.  Enjoy with a nice cup of coffee.
Now, let\'s eat! \n<br />Paddy Hills, Singapore
The avocado and vine ripe sweet tomatoes are nice accompaniments to the dish.  Some breakfast sausage is a good addition too.

Chefs have shown plenty of creativity around cooking it and this dish is no different, the cauliflower is dipped in a light and crispy turmeric costing then fried till crisp on the outside then served with a masala infused yogurt. That\'s a good substitute for French fries.
I prefer them in shoestring though...

Fresh pasta with a creamy uni sauce flavoured with some fried mullet roe which is reminiscent of Italian bottarga.  topped with a large seared scallop and a huge prawn which blanketed the extra seafood essence kick over the pasta.

Not to forget the well marinated steak at the side. I can finally understand the hype over this amazing bowl of fried rice. Not only does it looks nice, it taste as good/much better than it looks. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #paddyhills #steak

Kinda reminded me of \"muah chee\". Sweet potato balls was too chewy. Texture of the grass jelly was too firm. Plus point ... plating was nice. Was abit disappointed as it didnt turn out what i expected it would be😯 #sweetpotato #dessertlovers  #dessert #sgfoodie #burpplesg #openricesg @paddyhills.sg #burpple
The hanger steak was excellent, wish there was more of it. Fried rice had lots of wok hei flavour too!
Love it ! #foodie #foodstagram #instafood #food #yummy #burpple

And it\'s sweet tooo😍
Really light and fluffy, loved it but better when shared! 
Will totally come back with...... a 🚘. Food is great (!!) and ambiance is 👍🏻. #burpple #paddyhills #cafehoppingsg #cafesg #whatI8today
which was missing on our plate), homemade BBQ sauce, pickled shallot &amp; cherries.
Can\'t taste much. 
The squid ink flavour was there and the scallops were fresh! 👍
Fluffy, sweet and zesty.. Love the Orange ricotta pillows 😋😋😋
blueberry sugar, berries, pine nuts, mascarpone &amp; maple syrup
Instead of coffee, how abt some yummilious hot chocolate that comes with a bar of 78% dark chocolate. #paddyhillssg #paddyhills #sgfoodbunnies #hannahchiafoodtrail
😋😋😋
The saving grace was that scoop of coconut ice cream.
The food really lived up to its hype and the portions were generous! We left the place with full bellies but happy souls hehe 🙆
Perfect combination of all things yummy!
Really pretty and really refreshing!
Gorgeous cup of vanilla bean ice cream drowning in sea salt caramel Marcona almonds &amp; espresso. A little too sour, and the giant glob of ice cream didn\'t really help.

Not crispy... Not really to my liking. 
Yummeh! This #pasta tasted really unique! Pretty impressed with the the food here at #PaddyHills. Can\'t wait to try more!
So yummmyyyy, the best hotcake I\'ve ever eaten!!!!👅🍓
I like rice cakes anyway they are prepared😋 #ricecakes #sgcafe #mondaybrunch #burpple
Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($19) The Asian Brick ($18) 
:-)
Moistened from a slow pleasurable teasing session in the warm water baths, the thighs were glistening with its own juices. Certainly a sight to behold.... And even more delicious, ingested。
No regrets! Cafe hopping with @missjology during mid-week! \n<br />#foodies #food #foodiesg #foodstagram #foodphotography #cafesg #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #sgigfood #sgblogger #sgcafefood #vsco #vscocam #vscofood #instagramfood #instadaily #instamood #instafun #openricesg #burpple #dessertporn
I loved the thinly shredded potato and also the sauce that wasn\'t too creamy. But the seared sea bass was a little too fishy for me.
Delicious max! But y is it available only in the lunch menu? 😭😭😭 craving for this beautiful dish now!!!
Wagyu rump, beef noodles, shimeji ajitsuke tomago, charred romaine &amp; 22hr beef broth \n<br />#burpple #8DAYSEat
This bowl name Moo, using wagyu rump, beef noodles and most importantly is 22 hours boiled beef broth. Worth to try! Yum 😋
The combination of berries, pine nuts, mascarpone cheese and maple syrup is superb 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
The combination of berries, pine nuts, mascarpone cheese and maple syrup is superb. Loving it 👍🏼👍🏼😋
#Berry Ricotta #Hotcake was #crispy on the edges and it tasted more like a crumbly #cake on the inside. Us hungry hippos devoured this in minutes! Yum
to die for
Have a great week ahead everyone!
Not a bimbo though as it tasted as it good as it looked. This cafe ticked all the right boxes, and the attention to detail was evident from the food presentation and creative menu items, though I wished the same can be said of their service. #supportlocal #paddyhills #cafehoppingsg #sgcafes #instafood #foodstagram #foodpornsg #burpple #eatoutsg
The hotcakes were fluffy and went well with the mascarpone cheese. Nice! I liked this.\n<br />#vscocam #whati8today #onthetable #pancakes #burpple #whatdiet #omnomnom #explodingsiyi #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #paddyhills #icheemeetup

Really love how they placed such an importance in food presentation. #instafood #foodie #burrple #cafesg #sg #cafe #food #foodstagram
All are very good to me except the coffee. It\'s the bean I suppose too sour. And that confused glass of iced #mocha , sour &amp; sweet. Mmm.. And you can never go wrong with #trufflefries . #foodie #food #foodstagram #instafood #cafesg #latte #coffee #cafe #burpple
I wish I could make such a nice fried rice!! #yummy #foodie #instafood #foodstagram #food #cafesg #burpple #cafe #friedrice
The pancakes is so fluffy I wanna die.
garlicky in flavour married with the gorgeous flowly yolk. however, what seem to disappoint me was that the dish was served lukewarm \n<br />thanks for the recommendation @alainlicious &amp; @fundamentally_flawed
👍👍👍
Starting the day with a cuppa.
Super addictive lah.. 😄
#amiflatlaygrammeryet
Broth is slightly on the salty side and lacks the robustness that you would expect when someone blurts out the 22hr standard. Eggs leave much to be desired but that charred romaine was a pretty interested addition to the dish. \n<br />so, that leaves me wondering, what\'s everyone having tonight? 😜 #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #foodporn #beefnoodles #paddyhills #mehmehgang #SGcafefood #cafehoppingSG #nighttimenosh #igsg #burpple #pickatsg #8dayseat #sgfoodtrends #sgfoodunion
This is accompanied by a myriad of sauces, scallion oil, gochujang and kimchi Ito togarashi. \n<br />So delicious that we wiped out our own plate in minutes and resorted to poaching the dish from the next table to curb the cravings. \n<br />My only gripe would be the use of romaine lettuce, which bitter herbal notes mask the unctuous flavors of the short rib. still, a stellar dish in all its rights. \n<br />#burpple #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #foodporn #wagyushortrib #paddyhills #cafehoppingSG #SGcafefood #sgfoodunion #pickatsg #pickateer #toogood #picoftheday #igsg #mehmehgang #foodevangelist

I was bowled over by the egg and the rice combo, the fried chicken was just a bonus :)\n<br />#chicknegg #wokhei #smokyflavour #friedrice #friedchicken #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodbunnies #food #foodporn #burpple #paddyhills
Short ribs, scallion oil, gochujang and romaine sauce. The beef was killer, albeit pricey :)\n<br />#steakssam #shortribs #beef #gochujang #scallionoil #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodbunnies #paddyhills #igsg #burpple #yummy
[Chick an\' Egg]  with garlic fried rice, fried chicken, garlic chips, chicken skin and sous vide egg. A sturdy dish, suitable for those who like their food a bit heavier in seasoning. (Cue @therantingpanda ) 😜 #sgfoodunion #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #mehmehgang #foodporn #SGcafefood #hungrygowhere #burpple #friedchicken #friedthings
Enjoyed the crisp texture of the Korean rice cakes mixed with gochujang sauce and a oozy sous vide egg and iberico pork and sauce :)\n<br />#toasty #Korean #ricecakes #gochujang #sousvide #egg #iberico #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodbunnies #food #foodporn #foodstagram #burpple
Awesome time catching up over good food
Deliciously coated with maple syrup, super fresh berries and mascarpone with a faint buttery taste. Good looks, Good taste 👍 While the prices on the menu are on the high side, you don\'t have to pay for service charge like most cafes. Was really impressed with the service staff (Rubha), for being so friendly and joyful while serving us. Gona be back to try their mains. Opens daily from 9.30am. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #instadaily #burpple #dessertsg #paddyhills
The crispy edges of the cake is my favourite!
Love the crispy edges :-)
Had the Latte [$5.50] and Hot Chocolate [$6.50]. Waited about 15 mins for the drinks to be served but what I can say, it was totally worth the wait 👍 #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #sgeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #instafoodsg #igsg #burpple
#burpple #yummypin #shootkahliao
That dollop of ricotta cheese was my favourite part of the whole dish 🍓🍰 #shootkahliao
😊☺️😌 #nofilter #shootkahliao
Unfortunately, coffee here wasn\'t to my liking.
Just like death, these pancakes were just as good at its job, getting us to finish every, single, last crumb. \n<br />have a good weekend folks!
nonetheless, sashimi grade scallops which were amazing.
Australian japanese fusion

\'Taste Like Purple\' from Paddy Hills!
