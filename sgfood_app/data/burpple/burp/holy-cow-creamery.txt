Most of their ice cream flavours are a bold mix of various ingredients. I must say the ice cream here is excellent. One could choose to enjoy them in cones, waffles or even the classic bread option. I set my sights on the charcoal waffles with salted caramel sauce. It had a nice texture. Certainly not the best waffles but definitely value for money.
Waffles w Thai Iced Milk Tea and Ferrero Ice-cream, NOT BAD
New to the menu of Holy Cow Creamery is the Charcoal Waffles, which supposedly should come with Salted Caramel sauce which it did but their version tasted a little buttery and barely any bit caramel. The waffles were crisp and moist, but somehow a bit dry on the exterior. Went for my favourite Mao Shan Wang ice-cream which was smooth, thick and rich with the signature flavour of the pungent fruit.
When Holy Cow just opened, it created quite a stir among the yishun peeps. Finally a ice-cream cafe in Yishun! Well, the Honeycomb ice cream ($3/ scoop) didn\'t fail up to expectations. Try their sorbets if you are going for something light!  
One of the popular flavour, the honeycomb hit the right tinge of sweetness. Sadly, the ice-cream melt way too fast, making the cone soggy ):
First time trying the coffee here despite the many visits I made here. They use blends from Santino, a local roaster. Cuppa was smooth and creamy with a nutty tone, but wish they would go easy on the thick froth on the cuppa so it feels less foamy.
One of the newer flavours offered here. This was one of the flavours that has a thicker consistency here, with the mocha tasting more like chocolate here, filled with other goodies such as chocolate wafer balls for a crunch and almond flakes. Several misses in the taste profile but still rather satisfying.
Heard about some negative comments on their waffles but trying it for the first time it did not seem that bad; it had a bit of Buttermilk flavour and while it was not particularly fluffy, it was soft with a bit of crispness along the edges. Probably the only thing they had to work on would be the consistency in the texture. Ordered a scoop of Honeycomb (their best seller which I previously tried) and a Rudolph; a Christmas special involving gingerbread cookie bits in a cinnamon-flavoured ice-cream for a taste of the festive mood.
$10 with a scoop of Classic ice cream and a scoop of Premium ice cream. Interesting ice cream called Elvis - filled with peanut butter, banana and chocolate. The Salted Gula Melaka ice cream - made of coconut and brown sugar, comes strong and thick.
The place is reaaally small like Creamier. Earl grey lavender &amp; honey comb was damn good! Rocher was normal. Also thanks to the grp whom I apparently stole their table unknowingly from, I enjoyed this awesome ice cream and fluffy waffles very much. (cos they moved away, and\'d rather take a photo of us than clarify that they were taking the table. Seriously, just speak up..? I don\'t bite and am probably more afraid of them) ANYHOW, it\'d be good if the waffles were a little more crispy! Tasted a little like mcd\'s hotcakes at one point. 
The browniee was serve in quite a small piece &amp; hot . It gives no allowance of taking photo as the ice cream melts very fast .
üåºRate: 7.5/10\n<br />2 scoops with waffles &gt; Totally cannot finish But worth trying it. My fren bought vanilla milkshake and taste v.nice. 2 scoops + waffle prob cost ard $10+ üòä
The thai milk tea flavor was impressive.  Deep saturated thai tea flavor yet not overpowering. Perfect balance of tender sweet and cream.  Rum and Raisin on the other hand was a little disappointing.  The taste of rum is only in the rum soaked raisin. And the base of the ice cream is basically cream.
Paid yet another visit to Holy Cow Creamery, this time to try their Earl Grey Lavender. Fans of Earl Grey Tea would definitely approve of this as the aromatic tea was strong enough to soothe my senses. This flavour seems to taste less creamy somehow; wonder if it was their intention to cut down on dairy in its production so as to push for a more stronger and natural tea flavour rather than have a milkier taste.
Who would have thought, there would be a small hidden gem located at the neighbourhood? Well well, there is now and it\'s over at Yishun! Warm, crispy, fragrant waffles, with over a dozen, close to 20 ice cream choices to choose from. Cheap and good! The place may be a lil\' too small though, however it doesn\'t disappoint at all! Ice cream flavours includes rocher, NY cheesecake and Thai Milk Tea. Price range : $6.50 for classic waffles with a scoop of ice cream, or $7.50 for supreme flavours. 
I melt at this combination. No pun intended.  Earl Grey...... Lavender......
Back for the third time; now they are way busier and crowded than the last two times I visited them. Mr Potato Head is a Vanilla-based ice cream with salted caramel flavours infused, and comes with bits of chocolate coated potato chips (think Royce chocolates). Simply put together, it felt as though it was a combination of Cookies and Cream and Salted Caramel placed into one; a rather unique combination that not many had thought of putting together.
üòä\n<br />tried their mango yogi and elvis flavour and i must say their ice cream are good!\n<br />elvis is now my new favourite! #holycowcreamery #cafehoppingsg #icecreamwaffle
Finally, there is some new place to visit in the  North. 
With swealtering heat overtaking the island, the recent emergence of ice cream parlours hardly comes as a surprise. Catering to ice cream lovers in the North, Holy Cow offers a range of bold and exciting flavours that keep customers coming back for more. Their authentic Mao Shan Wang is strong yet sweet, and the honeycomb is definitely a crowd pleaser. Ever had Vietnamese drip coffee ice cream or ice cream with potato chip bits? Looks like this new ice cream parlour is a must-go!
Honey comb is seriously damn good and g agrees with me! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòâ
I haven\'t realize how much time I have spent here!
Got so hooked to their ice-cream that I was back again! Honeycomb was a sticky, sweet sensation as it had chewy bits of honeyed sweetness, while Miss Saigon was a Vietnamese Drip Coffee flavour that was refined; not the usual coffee-flavoured ice-cream you would expect!
Seems like the north is now starting to see the invasion of hipster eateries, with three day old Holy Cow Creamery setting up their base within Yishun. Currently in its soft launch phase, expect ice-cream in cups, cones and waffles, as well as coffee from Santino and tea from Gryphon. Their flavours are generally a mix of various ingredients; pretty daring but works out all pretty well. For those with cleaner palates, try the Earl Grey, Honeycomb and Miss Saigon; simple tea/coffee/honey flavours that are pretty delightful. With schools within its vicinity, it is bound to be a hit with the students looking for a sweet treat, as well as residents around the area!
Didn\'t get my ice-cream cravings fully satisfied so walked up to the next ice-cream parlour that is merely 30 minutes away. Their Mao Shan Wang is extremely pungent, but also on the sweeter side so it fits really well with sweet-tooths who just love Durian. Cone was crunchy and fragrant; seems to be freshly made in house. Now I really have my cravings satisfied!
The waffle is made on the spot and topped with 1 scoop of Earl Grey Lavender Ice Cream &amp; 1 scoop of Thai Milk Tea Ice Cream. Good food, chill location!
Interesting taste of salty and sweet on crispy waffle. Yums!
Great honey aroma and thankfully it was not artificially sweet. The scoop was huge for the price as well! Would visit it again if I‚Äôm in the area!
(PS, the one here is really good) ‚òïÔ∏è #burpple #sgfood #8dayseat #dessertporn

Hadn\'t been visiting for a while and quite surprised by how packed they are during lunch hours on a rainy Friday afternoon. They had a couple of new flavours but they were either sorbets or Thai Tea flavours (Sabai Sabai sounded interesting for the Thai Green Tea flavour), so I have decided to go for something that I had. This was as good as I remembered to be; milk-based ice-cream that was smooth and creamy laced with honey at random corners that gave it just a soft tinge of sweetness. 
BRUNCH AT #HOLYCOWCREAMERY WITH #GryphonTea \n<br />Crispy Chicken Waffle ($15.90)\n<br />Oven \'Fried\' Parmesan Chicken on top of Triple Cheese Waffle\n<br />Only available on weekends at @HolyCowCreamery\n<br />Like the cheesy with a hint of spicy taste in the light fluffy waffle.
Ok, that\'s all.
A refreshing change from the usual ice cream with waffles. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #earlgrey #lavacake #chocolate
A hidden gem in the yishun estate and a convenient place for me to satisfy my ice cream craving :) #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdesserts #dessertsg #icecream #waffles
The brownie was pretty disappointing though. Found it too chewy and sweet for my liking. Probably stick to their waffles for my next visit. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdesserts #dessertsg #brownie #sorbet
Waffle is getting better with crisp crust and bite since our last visit but ice cream wise their cookie and cream is way too sweet and I can hardly feel any bites on the Oreo cookies üòÇ. #cuisineparadiseeatout #waffle #icecream #burpple
This time with a scoop of delicious chocolate indulgence on crispy waffles. On a side note, the ice tea [$5] was a huge disappointment. It was too diluted and tasted more like flavored water to me. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #dessertsg #sgdessert #icecream
Elvis (banana ice cream with peanut butter and chocolate chips) was surprisingly light and not too sweet! \n<br />#VSCOcam #vscosg #vscofood #food52 #handinframe #sgcafe #sgeats #sgcafefood #icecream #burpple #whati8today
A scoop of classic flavor ice cream with waffle [$6.50]. The waffle was crispy on the outside while retaining the moist and fluffy texture on the inside. Plus it paired perfectly with the cookies and cream ice cream. Now I understand why it is so crowded till late at night. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #setheats #burpple #dessertsg #sgdessert #icecream
I did that! Even though I had to wait quite a while for it (they explained that they burnt the first one), I enjoyed it a lot with the #maoshanwangicecream and #earlgreyicecream The waffle is very good being crispy but not too airy or light. They #icecream are good too!
They always have that non-pretentious and friendly feel. Yishun is really far from home for me but #holycowcreamery is worth a visit if you are somewhere up north of #singapore
Thai tea ice cream flavor was close to having a Thai tea üòé
This is charcoal waffle with Áå´Â±±Áéã premium ice cream. The ice cream is really good.
Potato Head ice cream and a scoop of Orh-Nee ice cream! Yes! Orh-Nee ice cream! I didn\'t put it wrongly! First time tasting orh-nee ice cream! Although a little too light on the orh-nee taste but nevertheless a good effort to infuse this local teochew dessert into ice cream! Also like the MPH which is essentially chocolate and potato chip vanilla ice cream. The waffle is also very crispy although a bit on the \"rough\" side. Also a bit too sweet due to the sauce but overall a good one.
