Mee Pok was a bit clumpy, and a wee bit overpowered by the amount of ketchup going into it. Fishballs were bouncy, but also a wee bit old too.
Korean Zazang Noodles ($7.00) which came with BBQ Chicken and some vegetables (potatoes, carrots, cucumbers). The vegetables were not seasoned and though we were supposed to mix and eat it with the paste, the paste was not very strong and the vegetables still ended up tasting a tad bland. The noodles fared a little better with the paste though!
Korean Hotstone Mixed Rice ($6.80) from Woo Lee Jeeb Dae Bak is pretty spicy stuff! I love that the rice got a little crisp and burnt at the bottom of the bowl. This is why I usually opt for the Hotstone version if given a choice; it really brought out the flavour of the food! This Bibimbap is also available in a standard bowl ($5.80), but I\'d recommend getting the Hotstone version instead for a more authentic taste!
Tried their signature dish with Sausage, Chicken and Mushroom along with the other chicken dish on their menu. Both were not only visually appealing, but the the chicken and sausage were also tasty. The sauce went very well with the rice. However both were a tad too oily for me.
I love the pickled vegetable noodles  ($5.20) from Mian Mian Ju Dao at Food Republic. I generally prefer the dish with Mee Hoon Kuay or Ban Mian, but this time I tried it with U-Mian! The food was tasty and the noodles was very smooth and consistently cut. Portion was generous too! I still felt very bloated even after 2-3 hours!
We also got the Ban Mian Set Meal ($7.00) that came with a bowl of Ban mian, a plate of 3 fried dumplings and a side dish of your choice. We chose the braised peanuts. The portion for the bowl of Ban Mian was generous as usual. I also like their fried dumplings; it was a tad oily but otherwise tasty. If you are getting the ban mian, I\'d recommend getting the set since it\'s more value for money. On a side note, they also have other ala carte dishes available, such as the Fried Mantou ($3.00). Quite a range for a small store!
Ice Kacang ($2.50) from Ice Shop at Food Republic. Very refreshing, but sadly, the base ingredients portion was meagre; the red bean couldn\'t even filled the spoon! Otherwise, the taste is decent enough.
One of my favorite food at Food Republic - the Belgium Waffles with Ice Cream! It is priced at $4.80 for one scoop, with an additional $2.00 charged per extra scoop thereafter. Adding maple or chocolate syrup costs an additional $0.20. Waffle was crispy on the outside and soft inside, while the ice cream was smooth and very rich in taste! I love the Chocolate as well as the Cookies and Cream flavours! You can also get the ice cream on its own at  $2.50 a cup. Definitely worth a try!
Gelare long queue? head up to FR and get the same taste at less than $5
Chicken for... well chicken. Happy new year!

Ok, that\'s all.
The dish was full of flavors and crunch from the veggies and chicken. Egg was overcooked but still a decent dish overall. 3/5\n<br />#burpple
