Someone commented about this high tea from Brunches, so I tried today. It was only $32++ for two persons serve coming with a pot of tea. Each item is not like super fancy but they are tasty and we pleasantly enjoyed our meal! **they serve only 10 orders of high tea daily. Go there early enough to get one 
I never knew the cafe can be so Creative to put a small real car in the place for their decoration. There are also shelves of magazines and cute decorations to look at. Don\'t miss this awesome place! You can spend hours with friends talking over there... :))
Playing a game of Jenga with the heap of truffle fries.
Pan fried Salmon Steak with Hollandaise Sauce, with a price of $17.50++, I guessed it\'s quite a reasonable price for such a cute cafe like theirs. With an outer crispy layer followed by the soft juicy salmon inside, yummy!!!! You will never regret choosing this dish after a long week or a hard day at work. :) View more of their cafe\'s picture in my album!!
Crispy Duck Leg Confit with Balsamic Gaze 💕 This taste a little bit to the salty side because of the traditional way it was made. Overall it\'s a great dish, I love love love the crispy skin especially. Well, if calories count, I can tell you that this is definitely nice enough to let you ignore the calories you are about to consume. 👅😍
If your day has been really stressed out, fret not! Come to this cafe for a cuuuute cafe art and spend a great afternoon with your great friends! Trust me, when you do this, all your worries will be threw out of your mind 💕😍
This is one great tasting plate of frutti de mare pasta with seafood. Sweet and spicy with a hint of tangy notes, the sauce is very addictive and appetizing. It\'s so memorable that we went back for it again with friends within a week. 
😂 #punintended .\n<br />Ps: officially a cold brew convert because @oldhencoffee\'s version is 👍🏻👌🏻 and the molten lava cake from @brunchescafe was on point. 😋😍 In a nutshell, perfect break after a day of furniture shopping. 😌
A new item on the menu. The bite is slightly bigger than the other bite-size chicken I have tried, not by the flour but a generous serving of succulent meat concealed beneath the fragrant soft golden crisp,  filling each crunch (and my soul) more satisfyingly as I took one more bite. Huh, what calories?
My unusual order for brunch, and I was pleasantly surprised - the juicy  meat is tender and the crispy skin seduces you to take one more bite, and the cranberry sauce keeps the steak from being boring. Love it!
One of my favourite cafes.... impeccable service, quality coffee, good selection of food, alluring decor, cosy ambience, interesting items for sale...
The cafe looks magical with all the hanging birdhouses and a vintage car as a booth. Brioche French Toast ($13.50) and Deluxe Spanish Omelette ($14.50) both taste amazing. 
Tenderness of the steak with flowing yoke makes all mid wk stress slowly disappearing at the head. 
Was a bit intrigued at what could possibly be a chicken steak when I discovered that it is really just chicken chop. The chicken was well-cooked and nicely seasoned. Not your typical black pepper/mushroom sauce option. The cranberry sauce while interesting didn\'t really add anything special to the dish. While it was good, there\'s really no reason to go for this when Astons is probably a better deal, offering two sides and even two pieces of chicken for a cheaper price. Priced at $15.50
Gotta love the cafe with great desserts. Gotta love them more when they serve colourful Rainbow Cheesecake in the Gloomy haze. Perfect finish to the breakfast platter and iced tea combo. Going to go back to try the booth made from old car next time.
This plate of seafood pasta, drown in garlicky \"spicy\" tomato based sauce may looked good, but really the taste is absolutely boring, that I yawned halfway through it. While the seafood is decently \"fresh\", the sauce is too blah, that I found their table more interesting. The only saving grace would be their ambience and decor, and pretty polite waiters :) 
Portion is great for sharing. The roasted chicken is tender and juicy, with a slight crisp to the skin. The poached egg is kinda sad, and unsure of itself status on the plate. And the crisps lettuces and other veggies did their job. It\'s a forgettable dish, but your always \"to-go\" dish for your dose of garden greens. Ambience at brunches ain\'t to bad too, with many beautiful mismatch ornaments that goes well together.

Who can say no to them? These 2 dishes attracted us out of the many item in the menu.
Dessert Special Menu of the Day: Nutty Chocolate Truffle Ice Cream. Available only today till close for Father\'s Day.
😎: With a choice to have your eggs being poached, scrambled or sunny side-up is one of the hardest choice ever but scrambled is definitely my favourite!✌🏻️ Just like most of the cafe out there but their streaky bacon &amp; salad are pretty awesome!😊 Not bad la!😁\n<br />💰: S$15.9+    \n<br />💯: [3.5/5] 
Layers of chicken, streaky bacon, egg and cheese is definitely going to fill my stomach till evening! 😋
This reminds me of those pizza breads I used to buy from my neighborhood bakeries when I was a child, in a bad way 😕 
Looks not bad but tasted very plain. The cafe is very beautifully done up and you can tell lots of effort went into decorating it. They need to work harder on their food though!
The lobster bisque sauce was a novel but fine complement to the soft and flaky halibut. Be sure to finish it asap though, for the sauce turned strangely yucky when it cooled down towards the end of the meal.
...is this hard-to-go-wrong plate of chicken wings
With used cars as seats and with vintage antiques being put up for sale for customers, Brunches Café offers visitors a chance to travel back in time.
Although pasta was not exactly al Dente but prawns were succulent and yummy. Wish they would sell carbonara. 😉😉 good morning to everyone! Time to start preparing for exams already!
Love all these stress free drama free afternoons. ☝️✌ also found 2 new cafes that is good and quiet. Brunches cafe and letoile cafe. Both have wifi and they serve nice food. :)
Baked Eggs with Bacon because poached eggs is so last year hahaha!
After a disappointing first visit, I decided to give Brunches a second chance. I\'m happy to report that the cafe has improved tremendously. The well-executed Juicy Beef Burger made for a very satisfying meal, kudos to the enthusiastic staff as well!
Beef patty was seasoned nicely, moist and superbly crumbly. Felt it could have been seared a while longer, but still delicious! The burger relies heavily on the bbq sauce for flavour, which isn\'t too bad as it brought out the fragrance of the beef patty. Buns were soft. Fries were average, with heavy Cajun seasoning. Quite decent for $19.50!
Smoked salmon wasn\'t salty and didn\'t taste fishy. I really liked the grilled tomato, so juicy yet having the distinct grilled taste. Well cooked flowing eggs with average hollandaise sauce. I prefer softer English muffins but at least it wasn\'t dried out. Overall I rather enjoyed this! 
I deserve a better brunch with accompanying coffee. \n<br />Throwback to Sunday\'s meetup at branches café, with its retro deco and interesting seating area shaped like a old fashioned car, just hope the food could be improved to live up to it\'s café name :) Have a good Tuesday! 🙌
May not be a pleasing meal but it definitely was a great catchup! Have a good week ahead people!
Sunday Brunch: Eggs Frittata, Baked Eggs, Steak and Eggs and Earl Grey Cupcake .
The Baked Egg with Bacon ($10.90+) came with a toast that you can choose from either white, wholemeal and sourdough, sautéed mushrooms, 2 muffin shaped baked eggs and salad. The baked egg is rather normal tasting, with the sautéed mushroom being less flavourful and the bread doesn\'t taste as though it was toasted. The salad tasted rather alright though.
The Baked Egg Frittata ($10.90+) comes with a toast that you can choose from either white, wholemeal and sourdough, sautéed mushrooms, 2 muffin shaped frittata and salad. The frittata tasted rather similar to a Chinese egg omelette, though there was also ham inside to distinguish it from the dish. The sautéed mushroom being less flavourful and the bread (which I chose for the sourdough bun) tasted slightly sourish and didn\'t taste as though it was toasted. The salad tasted alright.
Made using a two-bean blend, the Flat White ($5+) here is medium bodied, but it is also bitter and felt as though the coffee is watered down.
A little disappointed with the #coffee. Every cup was bitter and very high in acidity. Can\'t even finish this cup. 😞
I was on my way to another cafe in the area but look what I found! Nice place to work as well with free wifi. 
Just discovered this new cafe in the Farrer park area. I usually don\'t take my coffee with any addition but the coffee is too bitter and acidic. The cafe is rather new so I guess they don\'t offer choices like skimmed or low fat milk or artificial sweetener. The dessert is cute and it does surprisingly taste good. The environment is quite retro but the walking path is rather narrow because there is a car (converted to a table with seats) when you first step in. 
Such a pity that the quality of food can\'t quite match the lovely ambience. Ingredients are fresh, but the kitchen needs to work on its technique
Salivating. Sauce was nice. $14.9+
✨ Aesthetically attractive and taste-wise, impressive. 👍🏻\n<br />#burpple #MRÂDÄ #RÂDÄ
The waffles standard is pretty \"meh\" and the fruits were really sour. 🍓🍇🥝🍒 The maple syrup didn\'t complement the waffles well, maybe it\'s the brand/type of maple syrup used? Oh wells! 😕 #throwback #waffles #wafflesandicecream #icecream #movenpickicecream #brunchescafe #burpple
Pretty tasty and filling.! Chicken is jus a tad hard but it\'s still the star of the meal as it is pretty thick and blends well with the sauces. Oh! This club sandwich is tall so you need to squeeze it to fit into your mouth!😉\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#brunchescafe#clubsandwich#sandwich#cafesg#chickensandwich#foodie#eatsg#delicious#rangoonroad#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

And not to forget a sweet treat for myself. 😍\n<br />•\n<br />當你很想去咖啡館但是又有功課要做的時候要怎麽辦？答：帶著功課到咖啡館做！😂 碰巧來的時間沒什麽人，後來也只有我一個人包下了整間咖啡館。真好😍 辦事效率也不錯哦~ 吃著冰淇淋的時候想起了和文學啟蒙老師提到的幸福• sinful~ 後來我有感而發，寫下了這句話。“我們都值得幸福，即使它有那麽一點sinful“ 當然不只是指美食，當然也不包括違背道德／造成別人不幸的行為。  #慧思敏語
On a more informative note, I really enjoyed the latte here (got it on sugar app) and although I usually am quite skeptical about food so blatantly colourful the rainbow cheesecake ($5.90++) tasted just right, ie. not too sweet. Was nice place to chill... i mean study. Didn\'t see power points though.\n<br />#sgcafe #sgfood #sgcafehopping #cake #rainbowcake #cafe #coffee #latte #burpple

Super quaint place (great decor, &amp; all vintage items &amp; furniture are for sale) with delicious pasta. Here is Frutti de Mare (Seafood in a spicy tomato cream sauce, $16.50++) &amp; Smoked Duck Aglio Olio ($15.50++).
Decently delivered. Nothing spectacular.\n<br />That\'s for the food.

Mango mousse cake, Choco brownie cheesecake and fruit juices to make up for the hot weather with super duper cool seats in a refurnished vintage car! The staffs were really friendly, good substitution for overpopulated old hen café. Had a really warm talk with my friend in this quaint cosy cafe we don\'t even wanna go off! 
Can\'t wait for @sugar_singapore \'s POP ART  party at CANVAS later! \n<br />#wewantsugar #we1sugar
Perfect 👌🏽
The little wooden \'lighthouses\' grow on me.
You can buy any vintage furniture in there.

Fanciful but the cupcake is still quite dry. Thumbs up for the deco of the cafe though #burpple
a new addition to the row of cafes at farrer park. quirky colorful vintage interior, also comes with a mini cooper sofa and car boot as a utensil deck. food was good, the bread selection was interesting too!
Hope you guys are recharged for the week! God bless! 😌
