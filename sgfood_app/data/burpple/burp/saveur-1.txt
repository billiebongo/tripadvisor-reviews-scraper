It gives me a reason to enjoy the pasta even more.
This simple dish never seem to fail me whenever I have my cravings. It is topped up with shrimp to give the pasta have slight crunchiness. I believe it is also one of the main dish that customer love to order. #eltonventure #sgfood #burpple
Chives, kombu, apple and fennel, lemon vinaigrette. [$10.90] The salmon was very well seasoned and texture was spot on, you\'ll know when you attempt to pull apart the meat gently!! This mind blowing dish really tempted me for a second serving! Too bad there were other things I wanted to try from the super extensive menu, will definitely be back for my salmon fix!! 
Lighted tossed in chilli oil, chopped kombu, pork sauce, Sakura ebi. This dish is light and for $4.90 you really can\'t ask for more from this dish! 
One of my favorite dinner place which never fails me. Affordable and good quality food! It may look unappealing but it\'s not too sweet and the custard is smooth. They offer different flavor cr√®me br√ªl√©e, do ask the staff before ordering.
Finally got to sink my teeth into their much lauded duck confit which was a steal at $13.90. So the meat could be more tender and juicy but hey who\'s complaining really? Ambience does leave much to be desired but I guess that would be really too much to ask for in view of the price range. We\'re not complaining. 
i must admit im totally not a pasta lover (in fact i dont even have pastas anywhere) but i nearly finished the entire plate by myself!! these two dishes is what i recommend especially the mashed potato mixed with duck, ITS DELICIOUS! 
Had this when we order their set lunch. Not to my liking but still acceptable, maybe I dun really fancy the sugar coating at the top layer
The famous duck confit, always sees people order this dish for their main. Sadly not sure why it is saltier than usual. Nevertheless their mashed potato is good.
For those who love angel hair pasta, this is a must try
This shrimp pasta was one of the starter for the 3-course meal! You can also get it separately at $7.90. Don\'t get deceive by the photo, the portion is actually rather small!
Creme br√ªl√©e was really good with lot of vanilla beans!! Oh, how I love vanilla beansüòç I strongly recommend you to go for this dessert!
This is the main I chose and it\'s really good, one of the best duck confit I\'ve ever had! Accompanied with mashed potato and mushrooms, perfect to my liking ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Yes, if you\'re wondering what this is, it\'s mushroom soup! Another choice for the starters. 
One of the best selling main course on the menu, it\'s easy to see why. The duck is soft and juicy, and the skin is crunchy.. the duck sits on a flavourful truffle mash and saut√©d shitake mushroom.. yum!
~\n<br />It would have worked a lot more better with a sauce of some sort.. But the duck was cooked to perfection. üëçüèª
For an affordable French fair fix, head to Saveur. All dishes are decently priced and add bang to your buck.
love the combined flavour of chilli oil, chives and sakura ebi which totally worked for me! üòç #burpple
Saveur offers possibly the most affordable French cuisine you can find, and you\'ve probably had many-a-meal here already. Priding themselves in the use of local products and making French food accessible to the masses, Saveur has become the go-to place for quality food that won\'t break the bank. Start with Saveur\'s Pasta ($4.90) ‚Äî capellini tossed in chilli oil, finely chopped Japanese konbu, and topped with minced pork sauce, chives and sakura ebi. For mains, get the melt-in-your mouth Salmon Confit ($10.90) or Chicken Roulade ($10.90). If you\'re in the mood for a complete three-course meal, their lunch sets priced at $22.90++ are available at their Purvis Street and Scotts Road outlets.
I was kind of disappointed in this dish, but couldn\'t complain because of the really affordable price. $9.90/plate, this Foie Gras is cooked well, but not enough. The liver is not pan-fried enough to have that crisp on the outside, and butter soft on the inside. That contrast is not enough. That apple \"chips\" should be cooked instead of keeping it raw, as it does not enhance or help the dish. They could have done better. 
The mashed potato hidden below the duck leg is truly flavourful, not overly creamy or salty. With the tender and well cooked duck leg, the dish is really wonderful. They could, however, add more saut√©ed mushrooms (well, i\'m just pure biased here because i love mushrooms). Has always been and will always be my favourite spot for french food :)
Available Mon - Fri: 1130am-3pm - $22.90++
- Chicken thigh stuffed with foie gras-infused chicken farce, creamy basmati rice &amp; parmesan sauce.
My sweet ending to my lunch, well infused earl grey creme brulee. Really good!
A well roasted duck drumlet sitting on top mashed potatoes, saut√©ed shitake with parsley &amp; garlic, orange segments &amp; orange - infused natural jus.
- Starter portion\n<br />Angel hair pasta tossed with chilli oil topped with minced pork sauce, chives &amp; sakura ebi
Chilli oil, fine-chopped kombu, minced pork sauce, chives and sakura ebi. It was a shame the ebi wasn\'t crispy, but this was some pretty satisfying pasta. 
Tender, juicy flesh with a crisp skin done to perfection... üç¥üê•üíó Can\'t believe I waited so long to return to Saveur!!! üòçüòçüòç
Ordered Chicken Roulade,Duck Confit,Seabass,Tenderloin and Savuer Pasta. AND IT WAS SOOO GOOD. Such a sumptuous mealüòçüëç
Duck confit, saveur pasta, pistacchio panna cotta n salted caramel lava cake are must try!
The Seabass wasn\'t as good as expected but the crab meat underneath was pretty good!
Personally I find it quite nice although it resembles the taste of Indomie mee goreng with shrimp bits üòÇüòÇ
Just caught The Hundred-Foot Journey, the food movie with a romantic sub-plot, about the cultural clashes between a French restaurateur and a new Indian restaurant set against a scenic backdrop of French country town. \n<br />Helen Mirren was luminous (as usual), Om Puri was brilliant, but the surprising breakthrough performance came from rising star Manish Dayal. If the cast was a restaurant, it could very well earn its Michelin star.
I would recommend this! There isn\'t any fishy smell/taste, the fish is cooked just right, the meat isn\'t too hard or too soft.. And it\'s not too salty too! Yum yum! Small enough to get me filled up. Good day to eat such food and made me a happy girl! :) it\'s at Far East plaza, which means take to orchard people!:)
Saveur, one of the place that you can find affordable &amp; delicious French / Italian cuisines! 
Served with table crackers, the mashed up duck meat soaked in its own fat proved a bit too salty for my tastebuds to handle. Or maybe it\'s really just me ...
The dish that everyone goes to Saveur for; that sakura ebi tossed in chili oil gives the al dente angel hair pasta a savoury-spicy kick that\'s extremely appetising. If you hadn\'t tried this there, you really hadn\'t been to Saveur.
Grilled Seabass with potatoes. Tender Duck Confit and Angelhair pasta with ebi. Super awesome French food for a great price with an awesome ambience to chill with friends. 
Duck leg confit $12.90 // Beef short rib $16.90 // Pan seared Seabass $14.90 // Saveur\'s Pasta $4.90. Personal preference for duck leg confit &amp; beef short rib is the nicest of them all! Love the mash potato especially. The price you pay for Italian food isn\'t too costly.
üëÄ This only costs $4.90 at this French restaurant! Signature #saveur pasta. #throwback
Pan-Seared Sea Bass $14.90. Another nicely executed plate there. The sea bass was really fresh and I love the saut√© diced potato so much that I almost wanted to order it as an extra side but I didn\'t cos stomach felt just enough for the day. Yumm.
Saveur\'s Pasta $4.90. One of the signature appetizer that almost every table ordered. A concoction of chilli oil, minced pork sauce and finely-chopped sakura ebi on angel hair pasta. But we thought that it was pretty average on the texture. But cheap lah...
Legendary Duck Confit! Really good.
New Year Dinner with love at Saveur.
The duck was really tender and flavorful. The base is mashed potato w saut√© mushroom. Not really very filling but it\'s a must try. The price was really reasonable too. 
Reasonably priced. Awesome duck and cod fish. But portion was a little small for the cod.
The skin was not totally crisp and the meat need to be a little more tender
[chocolate mousse with crushed hazelnuts, broken raspberries, roasted rice puffs, chocolate tuile &amp; praline] @ $7.90.
This was insanely good. Al dente! Value for money at $4.90 too 
Are you a soup lover ? If yes this would be one of your unique favorite ~ mushroom soup in Cappuccino style. Come on down to Saveur located at Far East 
Saveur\'s pasta... worth a try however I find the portion is too little... lolx... #foodporn #french
Pork belly with poached egg.. wow I\'m first time eating it.. hehe... :p #foodporn #French #crusine
Duck confit with creamy mashed potatoes... worth a try!!! #foodporn #french #crusine
#dinner date with @tribalzoid on this twenty-second. Thank you for the sweet thought! ‚ô°
Apart from the skin being too tough, I would say the meat is well marinated and tender. Worth a try!
Awesome French dinner at #saveur. Been wanting to try this place since forever, and it didn\'t disappoint. Mushroom cappuccino; Duck; Green Tea Creme Br√ªl√©e; Pistachio Panna Cotta. #yum #latergram
I just can\'t put a finger to the taste &amp; texture of this. And I can\'t decide if I dislike it or like it. It taste &amp; feels like a citrus fruit. After having it my friend and I decided to name it \"Salmon Confusion\". 
Pretty amazing to see how a corner coffeeshop French stall has grown to become a popular crowd favorite with their second outlet -- comes with a classy dark mystical twist!
Saveur now open at Far East Plaza L1. Make your way there to enjoy \'economical\' Foie gras, duck confit &amp; angel hair pasta!
One of the best Cod fish I have tasted in a while.
Flavourful and light aglio olio with crunchy fried ebi. Very valuable for money at just $4.90!
Meat\'s a tad tough, a tad salty. Not the best I\'ve eaten but considering the price I paid for this, it\'s reasonable. 
This is $9.9! 
visit saveur at purvis street or its new branch at far east plaza!

Pistachio cooked cream, ground and caramelized pistachio.
which in hindsight, was a rather baaaad idea. ü§î Anyway, this Chili Crab Squid Ink Pasta ($16.90) from @saveursg was a #yummy delight - liked the tasty, piquant sauce and the runny egg, though the dish seemed a tad bit too watery. üçù Happy #weekend! #throwback #foodpics #instafood #burpple #foodstagram #foodsg

New item on the menu. 
.. . . Disagree? ..... ... ..... .. anyway here\'s Duck Confit with the crispy skin, Pork Belly with crackling skin and my long-craved Prawn Pasta (the latter being an improvised versiom of the original SGD$4.99 one)
Pan roasted potatoes, crab meat, vichy carrot, caper vinaigrette [$15.90] loved the roasted potatoes!!! Almost, like half smashed, and they have a nice sear on the edges and the vinaigrette and crab meat made it really tasty when eaten together. Fish was nice overall but the fleshy part was just slightly on the bland side, maybe cause it\'s a thick and chunky slice. Well, it had a saving grace, which was the skin had a really nice crisp!! Loved the dish overall, I\'ll be really torn the next time I\'m back to get the same or try something else. üòãüòãüòã
love at first sight, but couldn\'t complete the last of all bites. perfect for hazelnut lovers and sweet tooths!
Liked the way pasta was twirled. Al dente. Chilli flakes, u see, was sprinkled by yours truly to make the plate less \"naked\". Unfortunately the pasta came to me \"cold\" (scratching my head cos it came within 4mins..fast leh) which i politely asked for a change.

The rice has a strong and bold tone that threatens to just slightly overstay its welcome, and the foie gras stuffed roulade has the necessary flavours, it also bordered slightly on the dry side.

Really a delight for the price(:
Possibly my most favourite dish of Saveur. The Foie-Gras stuffed chicken bore no stench, which should be more than acceptable for those who are afraid to try Foie Gras. Savoury slices of chicken sitting atop a bed of rice covered in cream sauce that was cheesy as well, this dish seems like a classy presentation of baked rice!
You would had probably heard of the place by now. They are known for their duck leg, though it can get a little \"strong\" after a few mouth because of the mashed potatoes. The pasta and salmon are delightful to your taste buds as well. 
If you are looking for nice quality #French #cuisine that doesn\'t burn a hole in your pocket then this the place to be! \n<br />Note that they don\'t take reservations, so be early or be ready to queue.
$7.90
