Galantine/ Japanese Raison \"Kyoho\"/ Creme De Vermouth\n<br />Available as the Les Entrees of the 3 course lunch set (S$40++) during @TheFrenchWeekSG from 10 to 18 Sep at @LewinTerrace\n<br />~\n<br />Interesting that the bread was served in a gunny sack, with hot stones underneath to keep the bread warm. I was a tab disappointed that the bread was served after I had finished the amuse bouche which was sweet potato soup served in a tea cup. |\n<br />|\n<br />Lewin Terrace\n<br />Address 🏠 : 21 Lewin Terrace, Singapore 🇸🇬 179 290\n<br />Tel ☎️ : 6333 9905\n<br />Open 💈 : 12pm - 3pm, 6.30pm - 11pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : City Hall (NS25/ EW13)
Base of pre-baked Koshihikari risotto with edamame, slightly crisp around the edges with a sweet nutty flavour. \n<br />Strings of okahijiki / salsola land seaweed cushion a lovely tile fish fillet that has a rich buttery texture.
Appetizer that packs big flavour. A work of art on the plate, vibrant briny sea urchin against smoky beancurd, crunchy fried green beans, and a bright hibiscus flower. Luxurious!
Warm hospitality at this acclaimed Japanese French fusion fine dining establishment. \n<br />Contrast of chewy and crispy, with creamy mascarpone, briny caviar, and gold leaf; calls to mind the freshness of the ocean.
Digging into some of that Abalone, seaweed jelly and lime leaf 😋
Sometimes it\'s the little things that make all the difference.\n<br />#LewinTerrace #NiigataCity

When this starter was presented, the round black charcoal cracker was placed on top acting like a lid on a pot. Slide it to one side and exposing the smoked salmon and ikura with cauliflower mousse, coucous and coriander.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Cracker crispy with a bit of a wokhei-ish tone. Mousse had a dainty umami sweetness from the cauliflower. Coucous texturally nutty and salmon with a luscious smoky finish. Such a coquettish starter. The different textures and flavors were just phenomenal.  Plating that plays with your eyes first then tickles the palate with its vibrant inner beauty.
Codfish with mango bits and barley in a lime leaf sauce.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Sitting regally on top of the cod, is a baked savoy cabbage. So very crispy like a piece of thin cracker. 1st bite and it cackled. Cod was alittle charred at the sides but moist inside. I could taste the natural sweetness. The yummiest component had to be the sauce. Very zesty and refreshing, atad creamy with citrus aftertones from the mango bits and a nutty crunch from the barley. ◾◽\n<br />It looks petite but big surprises comes in small packages. A simple broth with big simple flavors that is exhilarating. So yumz that my bowl was spotless.
If one looks hard enough, you can even see a squirrel or two scrambling up the tree.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Tangy beetroot with a tinge of sourness and crunch from the bits of beetroot. Baked pumpkin so creamy and luscious. The zestyness and buttery flavors complemented each other leaving a refreshing and velvety aftertone.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Cozy ambience, dim lights and soft music was a perfect setting. \n<br />Thank you @lewinterrace for selecting me as the winner for your photography contest and hosting us to a wonderful dinner.
Best of both worlds; french and japanese handmade breads.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />The breads were placed on top of hot stones which actually kept the breads nice and warm for a long time. It even stayed warm till I finished my meal. Accompanied by a delectable yuzu butter spread. Smooth as silk and with a tangylicious finish. ◽◾\n<br />Gorgeous breads with a clean minimalistic zen like look. \n<br />#appetizers #breads #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodstagram #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instasg #eatbooksg #tripadvisor #narratrs #lewinterracefoodography #lewinterrace #citynomads

Really... no kidding.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />The foundation is mascarpone. Crowned with an edible rose petal with a teeny drop of lychee &amp; lemon puree. Flanked by 2 pieces of sliced choux puff and raspberry candy. Dusted on the plate is a gorgeous taro powder.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />Sweet and tangy. My favorite was the raspberry candy which just melts in your mouth. A small dainty dessert on a big plate. But you know, it takes a big heart to say those three little words. \n<br />#lunch #dessert #dessertlovers #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igfollowers #instafollow #eatbooksg #discoversg #chopesg #citynomads #lewinterracefoodography
Roasted cod with brown onion, ginger and carrot puree.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Cod roasted to perfection, still tender and moist inside. Crusted with white sesame seeds for the crunch. Brown onion cooked in rock salt for 3 hours turning it into a dark brown smooth sauce like consistency. Carrot puree was so sweet and silky. The butternut squash which was imported from Ishikawa, was just delectable. ◽◾\n<br />This was an amazing lunch coupled with elegant plating. Located on a \"hill\", it has a nostalgic and countryside, rustic charm feel. I was quite amused to see a squirrel running up and down the tree. You cant believe this lovely place is in town.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />I also got to meet Chef Keisuke Matsumoto who was nominated for Chef of the year for the coming World Gourmet Summit Awards Excellence 2017. It was an honor chatting with him. Thank you Chef Keisuke @lewinterrace for coming out of the kitchen, explaining what was on the plates and chatting with me. Loved the food and service was excellent.
A cauliflower cream soup with eel cristal tempura resting a bed of coriander rice.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Soup was thick, creamy and smooth with a nice gentle sweetness from the cauliflower. The coriander rice had a consistency similar to glutinous rice. The eel tempura was fried resulting in a thin crisp batter.  A well balanced soup that looked delicate with silky and crunchy textures.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />A fusion of French &amp; Japanese cuisine. Already wowed by the starter. Cannot imagine how wow I would be when the mains are served. Curious??

The taste of Autumn. Resembling fallen leaves on a path, this creative dessert is teased with smoked leaves!
The CHUTORO was supposed to be served raw but being pregnant, @lewinterrace kindly arranged it to be cooked so I could still enjoy the combination of different flavors.
Abalone, seaweed jelly and some chopped lime leaf.
Beautiful place, bring a new perspective to taking a walk to lunch.
The best duck breast ever! Tender and well flavoured, if only there was more!! #hungryghost

Amazing Omakase experience at lewin terrace that serves Jap-French fusion! On top of great food, there was amazing service as well (and of course an amazing impact on the wallet) The food is super fresh as it is all sourced from North Japan. Every single dish was light and refreshing. But my favorite of all was the wagyu beef. There was just nice enough fat to melt in your mouth without the overly fatty feel. It was very interesting that they had grated wasabi on top of it but you do not taste the spiciness of wasabi though you taste it for sure. In the other hand, the leek was very spicy, the rush to your head kinda spiciness. 😱 The chocolate soufflé was a nice touch and they would accommodate any special occasion. ☺️ Lastly, the bottom right dish is actually a spiced cake wrapped in apple wood and served a top curry leaves. They burn the apple wood before serving it to you, to give it a nice woody scent. I swear I was tempted to bring it home!!! Haha!

This is the exquisite \'Hassan\' starter. My fav component was a tie between the intense Uni on seaweed jelly and delightfully light cauliflower foam paired with squid.
