healthy dessert! 8 pcs for $9. it feels like having a tau huay in a tart. The tart tastes biscuit-y and fragrant. Remember to call and reserve yr tarts before going to collect them ! I\'m lucky enough to be able to buy 2 boxes via walk in.
Breakfast situation where @lecafe_sg has ingeniously merged into two of my favourite food products into one sublime confection 🙆🏻. Crumbly shortcrust tart shell with soft silky curds of Tau Huay. I\'m positively in love! 9bucks/box of 8\n<br />#FTrecommends #FTflats #beancurdtart
Such perfect sheen on each piece. The custard is smooth and rid off any air bubbles with just the right balance of sweetness and creaminess from the soy milk. But the crust remains the best thing about it – crumbles lightly and has a cookie-like texture that is buttery yet light. Obviously, you don\'t eat just one. Ok, that\'s all.
Smells like fresh tau huay. Best eat them chilled. Loves the silky texture of the beancurd. $9/box/8pcs for original Beancurd tarts!\n<br />Didn\'t managed to get the mixed ones. Next time can call 6337 2417 to reserve in advance! $10/box/8pcs for the mixed ones. 
That\'s how much each tart costs when you get a box of eight of these silky smooth beauties for $9! Don\'t bother wondering if you can really finish all 8. They\'ll be gone in a flash.
Delicious tart with beancurd instead of the usual egg based tart, is a healthier and less sweet alternative and is also at a value worth price of 8 pieces for $9. Definitely coming back for more👍👍👍
Have been a fan of these for years but only realized recently there\'s assorted flavours like red bean, grass jelly, ginko nuts, peanuts etc. \n<br />Highly popular, reservation a day prior is recommended.
[Box of 8//$9] 蛋挞 has always been a part of my life from young. Never have I once not buy my favorite egg tarts whenever I go pastry shopping with granny 😋👵🏻\n<br />So how can I not try these tarts after seeing peeps posting on social medias? 😎\n<br />Well, I must say, it\'s really not bad! Though egg tarts are much more flavorful, these silky bean curd tarts are much softer with each bite. They might be lighter in taste but definitely give a refreshing taste &amp; the baked crust was on point 👍\n<br />~\n<br />Overall, IMO: 3.5/5 ♠️
Other Flavours include - ginko nuts, lychee, grass jelly, red bean, egg white and peanuts!
Fell l in love with them at first bite!
Old school flavors from old school bakeries. You just can\'t get the same flavors from breadtalk or any other not so traditional bakeries. 6 for $8.50 much cheaper than breadtalk as well! 
Very similar to the egg tart, the difference is in its texture. The bean curd tart is extremely smooth and light. The filling literally melts in your mouth owing to the soft texture of bean curd vs custard. Comes in 10 other varieties. Delicious served hot or cold. (90 cals/tart) ($10.00/box of 8) #yumyumyap #sgfoodie #localdelight #beancurdtart #dessert
The buttery tarts are filled with delicious smooth beancurd that you can\'t just stop at one. The original flavoured tarts are sold in a box of 8 at $9, and get sold out pretty fast so to avoid disappointment do call them to reserve first!
LE Cafe Confectionery &amp; Pastry | To be served chilled, the tarts are much smoother and softer than the usual egg custard tarts. With the fragrance of soya bean in their filling and the buttery pastry cup, you can understand why they are often sold out within a hour. Sold in a box of 8 for each flavour, these delish treats are only available after 12.30pm and to avoid disappointment call early to reserve a box! (Cost between $9 to $11 for a box depending on the flavour)
WRONG. These babies are Bean Curd Tart from the famous Le Cafe Confectionery &amp; Pastry! Awesome beancurd in the crispy and buttery pastry cup! 😍
$10 for 8. Buttery crispy crust, smooth beancurd filling, loved it!
This is really quite good. I only like the original ones than those fancy ones. Recommended by @dailyfamousfoodies
Love these for their crisp buttery crust and wobbly beancurd filling, tastes quite light &amp; pseudo healthy. 
Stopped by for their famous beancurd tarts and couldn\'t resist getting these. Just evokes that sense of nostalgia. 6 pieces at $8.50, really lovely old school cakes, too bad you can\'t choose the flavors, they\'re all prepacked. My faves are the strawberry, pandan &amp; orange. 
was feeling hungry so snucked into de fridge and found it. one of de better made crusts for such tarts. crispy yet does not crumble too easily. tried one yet?
I\'m lovin it! This beancurd tarts are so popular that you have to call and reserve, walk in might not have ready stocks for you.
You\'ve been hit by, you\'ve been struck by.. A smooth criminal. 😎
Pineapple Tarts from Le Cafe. The pineapple tarts are as big as a ping pong ball. Love this brand the most!
[ Dinner ] Eating Hin Hwa Mee Sua in Tyre Cafe
Its my favourite! Their pineapple filling is generous and it\'s very yummy 😋 But is slightly more than $1 per golf ball! Tip: Speak in Cantonese to lady boss if you order, she is ultra friendlier if you do! They don\'t take orders anymore but there might be an occasional extra box or two for sale every day at the Hindoo Road outlet at Jalan Besar, if there isn\'t any at Middle Road. Eat in moderation because of high calories! 🐳 MerRyan is very happy! #pineappletarts #lecafesg #merlion #merryan #singapore #middleroad #yummy #dessert #burpple
Not too sweet and best eaten chilled, gather all your friends to buy the box of 8 right now!! Only in stores after 1230pm! \n<br />#onthetable #whati8today #exploresingapore #sgfoodie #sgig #sgeats #sgfood #soyabeantart #burpple #burpplesg #stfoodtrending #tslmakan
.\n<br />Kick start to the month of birthday celebrations with a beautifully sculpted longevity cake for my granny.\n<br />.\n<br />While I usually patronize them more for the beancurd tarts, their signature Mandarin Orange cake took me by surprise with its refreshing citrusy fragrance, while sandwiching occasional chunks of mandarin orange between the sponge cake.\n<br />.\n<br />Flavorful and yet not overly sweet, suitable for all age groups.
My favourite? Drum rolls..... Longan and Grass Jelly!\n<br />.\n<br />#lecafeconfectionery #beancurdtart #pastry #yummy #onmytable #sharefood #topcitybites #tslmakan #exploresingapore #love #beautifulcuisines #flatlay #burpple #stfoodtrending #whati8today #singaporeinsiders

I bought the 8 Mixed Bean Curd Tarts S$11 in assorted flavours such as Original, Grass Jelly, Longan, Gingko Nut &amp; White Fungus, Peanuts, Red Beans and Egg White.

Although we didn\'t managed to get those with assorted fillings like grass jelly, ginkgo nuts &amp; red beans but this normal ones are just good enough with healthier choice compared to the usual egg tarts. #cuisineparadiseeatout #burpple #lecafe #eggtart
Silly smooth bean curd filling in thin soft pastry. It has won my heart many times that egg tarts need to stand aside. 😍 Call them to reserve those tarts to avoid disappointment!\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #instafood #f52grams #instafood_sg #exsgcafes #singaporeinsiders #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #lecafesg #visit_singapore #asiafoodhunt #beancurd #tarts #pastry #dessert
