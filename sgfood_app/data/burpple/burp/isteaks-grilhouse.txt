A thick cut with a good char on the outside. This place would probably be compared to Aston\'s but they do serve pretty good steaks at affordable prices. #burpple
Got the honey sauce &amp; chicken was soft and tender. Generous portions and side dishes too. Plus one of the cheapest western meals I\'ve eaten!!! def worth it!! Although my friend bought the beef burger and it did look q small.. Maybe stick to the fillets/steaks hahaha
Terrible sides, good job on the steak. The steak is done perfectly, as how I want it to be, gorgeously seared and grilled on the outside, and medium-rare all the way through on the inside. I wished they wouldn\'t give the sides (or perhaps I chose the wrong sides), for the mac&amp;cheese is simply too yellow in hue, and taste nothing like cheese even though I expect to be artificial. The cream-spinach fared better, edible, but mushy and taste very much synthetic, which I don\'t even know why! An Aston-wannabe, that need a lot more twerking on its side dishes. 
Price: $17.90 for a 250g striploin steak (comes with 2 sides). Verdict: would visit again if I\'m at holland V and crave for some meat. Isteaks is a Aston-like concept establishment in holland v. I would say the food quality is slightly superior to what one would find at astons. The steak was okok nothing very special. The sides are also ok. Nothing much to complain about either of them, but nothing much to rave about either. Perhaps their biggest selling point is that they are relatively cheaper to what one would find at the other similar-cuisine establishments in holland V. If you don\'t dig steak, Isteak can still satisfy you in another way because isteak also serves chicken dishes and pasta at an even more affordable price of ~$9+-. Wouldn\'t find visiting again with friends!
Been trying to control my food as I know festive season coming but my appetite went big today. All these for just $26+ no service charge. Loved that their cream pasta is not milky type and peppery taste enhance the bacon flavor. Chicken chop is well grilled, no fats but a bit thin. This is up sized version. Baked potato, mac&amp;cheese is nice too. #sgfood #burpple
There\'s 2 other western stalls at the opposite food centre selling cheaper. But paying 50% more at iSteaks and getting 200+% satisfaction feels way better. Grilled chicken and 2 sides of choice ($7.50). Open till late for supper and after-beer activities.
Tasty and yummy with a wide choice of side-dishes to choose from : Olive rice, onion rings, crispy potato salads, baked beans, cheesy pasta, creamy broccoli..etc.. *Drooling*    
The amazing and never fail to surprise me each time I visit their stall. This is one of the most flavorful fish fillet in store üòÑ with the combination of Mac&amp;Cheese and Baked Potato. It\'s like a complete set meal to me. 
This was a side we ordered to go with our steaks. It was alright (probably jaded after eating this in Taiwan!), although I\'ll probably try their saut√©ed mushrooms the next time. 
Medium rare steak at a coffeeshop in Holland Village. It was a very good meal, nothing beats biting into soft and tender man-food and savouring the juices that flows out of the meat. The sides were great too. For just $15, will definitely come again. 
The chicken is great! Actually, what wins me over is the onion rings! The onion rings are made of real onions unlike other cheap western food outlets.
.\n<br />NZ Ribeye 250g with Mash Potatoes and Spinach &amp; Sesame Salad ($23.50).\n<br />.\n<br />Well charred, juicy and almost melt in your mouth. It was cooked a bit pass medium rare, but it was still delicious.\n<br />.\n<br />I like the spinach salad, as the sweet sesame sauce covered the bitterness in the spinach.\n<br />.\n<br />The meal here definitely value for money.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #nzbeef #nomnom #isteakdiner\n<br />#topcitybites #vscofood #foodoftheday #fdprn #myvillagesg #ribeye
.\n<br />.\n<br />For me, what makes a good burger is a juicy beef patty, a slice of melty cheddar cheese all sandwiched between 2 tasty toasted buns. In isteaks diner, they definitely serve delicious burgers. The beef patty was grilled to perfection, extremely tender, full of beefy flavour. As you pressed the burger and devour it, you can just see the juices overflowing from the patty, like a beefy juice waterfallüòç With that slice of cheddar cheese, it gives the burger that extra melty salty edge. Also, I can tell that they put in effort in their buns, not just any rubbish like some other placesüôÑ Last but not least, the fries are thick to my liking. Will definitely come back for this burger againüëçüòã\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodstuff #sgfoodtrend #foodsg #foodpics #foodphotography #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgfoodhunt #sgeats #instafood_sg #instafoodie #instaeats #igsg #whati8today #singapore #burgers #burpple #burpplesg #exploringeats #exploresingapore #sgfooddiary #foodgasm #8dayseat #foodadventure #yumminess #getinmybelly #eeeeeats
Oh so good!\n<br />#burpple #MR√ÇD√Ñ #R√ÇD√Ñ #HBDrhea
Though I prefer the sides more.
Macaroni and Steak so good. Affordable price.
P.S. Cream broccoli is also served in a huge chunk like the cauliflower.

Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 $$$: Mid Range. Overall feel not really that fantastic and cheap... there\'s nicer alternatives like Char-grill, Astons, etc. #food #foodie #igdaily #igfood #westernfood #isteak #hollandvillage #latergram #throwback #burpple #burpplesg #xmaseve #xmas2016 #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodmemo #steak #lamb #qiangxxuan #fondmemories
Yet this juicy tender medium-rare of a beast certainly knew how to make an impression. At $18 (w/ two sides), this steak deserves a close-up for all its cross-section glory üòõ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #hungrygowhere #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #8dayseats #sgig #igsg #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #tslmakan #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #burpple #burpplesg #exsgcafes #setheats #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodsteps #sgigfood #sgmakandiary #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #exploresingapore #singaporeinsider
or simply this nicely Grilled chicken chop with Mushroom sauce, together with a whole plethora of wonderful side dishes (many of which rather unconventional and cant be found in Astons), like the Cream Spinach in the background, or the perfectly done Mac and Cheese... and all for a price of $9 NETT (cheaper than Astons!!) A stark contrast in prices to Park and yet, quality food. Highly recommend!! Though not as many branches as Astons, they do have many other outlets too!
Been sticking around but I had no idea such an awesome place has been around. iSteak offers a different cuts of steak in affordable prices. You could even enjoy your steak with a $1.50 teh ping; totally awesome right?
Fresh made sides with a tender piece of steak
