Though they could definitely do with more meat than bones, they really serve queue- &amp; wallet-worthy excellent roast duck, as well as great cut ratio of pork belly. Char Siew was alright, but I recommend that you guys give their chicken &amp; pig trotters\' dishes a miss, quite a waste of calories. The other dishes we got were so-so. Overall verdict? Just go for the duck I say. Oh, &amp; don\'t leave this place without ordering their milk tea, that was pure divine HK style.\n<br />Their order forms are those traditional English-Chinese style without pictures, real confusing for me though. Not sure how I can survive in HK.\n<br />.\n<br />So for update, as I\'m currently having temporary vision loss on one eye due to corneal abrasion, won\'t be posting for awhile because I seriously can\'t edit &amp; read much 😂 Positive thoughts because thank god it\'s not permanent 🙏🏻 (I swear I seriously freaked out &amp; thought I was going to be blind the rest of my life).\n<br />Well, too many things happen this 2016 but it\'s okay let\'s keep smiling! I trust that we should count our blessings &amp; not our problems.\n<br />Thankful to everyone who was there, especially the one who waited with me all through those long hours at the A&amp;E yesterday.
Shaped rather cutely in a Hello Kitty form, the pudding contains a smooth, fibrous durian mousse within. Hope they would pay a little more attention with what goes into the food though; one of the spikes from the shells ended up inside the pudding which is a tad dangerous if ingested.
Another spot that serves Salted Egg French Toast apart from 7KickStart Museum Cafe; also the only other one I know of selling this as well. The French Toast here is slightly thinner, thus more manageable to finish while being more crisp, soaked in egg wash and pan-fried. Admittedly there can be more salted egg custard filling (it still flows pretty decently though), but apart from that the salted egg custard is more on the sweeter side here with a light hint of salted egg flavour lingering around. A jug of honey comes on the side, though probably you might want to hold back on it instead of heavily drizzling the toast with it like me; the honey sort of kills the sweetness of the salted egg custard, which hinders the experience quite a bit. Still, pretty apt for a tea time treat at $3.80 though which is quite affordable for the salted egg fix.
Thought this was going to turn out similar to the Baked BBQ Pork Buns from Tim Ho Wan but was in fact chunky BBQ Pork slices in between Legendary Hong Kong\'s signature Custard Crust Bun spread with creamy mayonnaise; all fluffy, crusty and buttery goodness. They seemed to use the same BBQ Pork from the HK Roast for this, which was more savoury than sweet, being chunky, tender and juicy though lacks the smoky, charred flavour. Interesting combination, but I would probably go for the version with a butter slice next time which I felt was a more comfortable option.
A Cantonese dim-sum item that\'s not commonly available in dim-sum restaurants here in SG. 炸两肠粉. While the rice roll is thicker here, the crispy dough fritters made up for it. Reasonably priced at $4.80 a plate. Not bad. 
All day comfort food from Hong Kong. Described as Imported HK Nissin Noodles. At $5.80 per bowl, served with cooked ice-berg lettuce, fried egg and 2 pieces of luncheon meat. Was yummy and comforting, just like in Hong Kong. 
Errrr...not my kind of food. If it\'s Star Fruit, I\'ll eat it. LOL.
Having London Duck (it\'s Irish) for lunch. Ok... Here we go again.... Five little ducks went out one day\n<br />Over the hill and far away\n<br />Mother duck said \"Quack, quack, quack, quack.\"\n<br />But only four little ducks came back.
Be transported back to classic Hong Kong Cha Chan Ting at Legendary Hong Kong, located at Jurong Point. Metal chairs meet classic tiling, creating an all-too-familiar CCT setting, characteristic of Hong Kong. 
One of my favourite places to get  authentic HK food in Singapore is at Legendary Hong Kong Jurong Point. \n<br />It has an old-school HK Cha Chaan Teng, serving a spread of roast meats, pastry, toasts, noodles, congee, dim sum, and the famous ‘London Roast Duck’. Now, you can Feast Your Way To Your Dream Holiday to Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Dubai. Find out how! http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/11/10/jurongpoint/  #jurongpoint

The restaurant was renovated to really look like an hold char Chan teng in HK! The malaigao was super fluffy and the best part of the pineapple buns were the liusha filling! Spent around 25$ here plus 2 drinks. Bit on the pricier side.
Pair it with a lemon ribena (straight off from the cha caan tangs of Hong Kong) and you\'re found yourself a winning recipe for breakfast, tunch and maybe tea! #foodporn #legendaryhongkong  #burpple
Tuck into a sinful polo bun with sunny side up and luncheon meat sandwich!
Had some drool worthy dim sum at Legendary Hong Kong.\n<br />One bite of the Thick Rice Flour with Deep Fried Shrimp Spring Roll or 春风得意肠粉 made me literally go, \"wow!\" The shrimp spring roll\'s crust was so delicate that it just crumbles in your mouth. Its contrast with the film of silky rice flour gives your goosebumps.\n<br />Besides the food, when I\'m sitting in the restaurant, I feel as if I\'ve been transported to Hong Kong but the waitstaff are 10x more patient.
Polo liu sha bao n pan-fried turnip cake for late tea break. The liu sha in the bun was dry and not the drippy kind but the texture of the bun made up for it. The liu sha was not bad despite the dryness. Turnip cake was normal.😄
Crispy but not oily. Filled with sweet crunchy prawns. Went really well with the black vinegar and chilli sauce.
Prawn dumplings were filled with black wood ear fungus, sweet prawns and bamboo shoots. Fillings could have been a little tastier with more seasoning. Soup was sweet with hints of shrimps.
My stint over at NTU has brought me over to the far west, which in fact, has been v surprisingly impressive w it\'s wide selection of food and shopping!!! Recently got to try this quaint cafe over in the HK street at JP, and boy am I won over. The whole deco and vibe this cafe gives (complete w the ambience of the HK street) made me feel like I was back in the bustling city of HK once again. I almost expected the staff to converse w me in Cantonese. But atmosphere aside, I am pleased to say that their cuisine is almost on par and matching in standard to local HK cha chan teng fare!!!! So elated to have found a cafe in sg which can at least match up to HK\'s standard. Looks like I\'ll be patronizing this place reallllyyyyy often. 
Legendary Hong Kong is pretty noted for its good execution of their Bolo buns. Apart from Bolo buns with butter, they also serve a mini version that comes with Salted Egg Yolk Custard. The bun comes in the all-familiar package that we expected them to be; crusted, buttery yet fluffy at the bottom. Salted Egg Yolk Custard was a good balance of sweet and savoury, and though the filling was not too measly, we can\'t help but to compare against another rendition by a restaurant situated in town which is more well-filled. Overall a good to order, especially if you like Liu Sha and Legendary Hong Kong\'s Bolo buns.
Almost.
Given his very traditional taste buds, glad he likes the food at @LegendaryHongKong #LegendaryHongKong 😊😊😊 If you are at JP between 2.30pm to 5.30pm, check out their Happy Hour Afternoon Tea Set (Congee with century egg &amp; pork + Pan Fried Turnip Cake) only at $6.50 \n<br />They are also offering 30% discount for their Tea Time Dimsum 😍😍😍 shall try their dimsum the next time!
Slightly sweet and savoury, the Polo Bun from the Legendary Hong Kong is one of the better pineapple buns that I have tried. Best eaten with the thick slab of butter sandwiched between the warm soft centre and the crispy bun crust; You are guaranteed a mouthful of rich and buttery goodness ~
It\'s really cooked the HK style, but with fatty ducks  (supposedly) from Irish farms. All in all, pretty good anyway! 
This I think is better because it is crispy and it has prawns in it. This is #LegendaryHongKong\'s Prawn Spring Rolls in Rice Rolls.
Spread more butter in your polo bao to smoothen your weekend away.
If you are familiar, Asian goes to the higher floors where there\'s a slightly different menu and pricing than what the \'locals\' eat on the ground floor. We wanted to order \'duck\' only and they said we can\'t do that. They have limited portions of duck per day and we can\'t order just ducks. We found it amusing and even though the wait staff that we spoke to are a mix of Malaysians and Singaporeans, they can\'t break the rules for us. We had to order some set thingy so we can have the duck. Here in Singapore, we can order just the duck and it\'s about similar to the ones there. Maybe I need to visit the other half of the family again to remember the taste of the London ducks in London. 😂😂😁 Those who used to live in London, try and see if it\'s the same here at Legendary Hong Kong, they use Irish ducks here.
What makes it different? The Grade A Irish ducks from Silver Hill Farms bred in the cold climate and de-feathered by hand, ensuring meats are not bruised. Apparently the same ducks used at many roasted duck restaurants in London. It is then roasted Hong Kong style by chefs that have been roasting meats for 25 years. I have yet to queue up for the two other new duck places, can\'t when we have a unpredictable baby in tow, hopefully soon. I last had similar ducks in London more than 2 years ago, so I can\'t really remember exactly how it tastes in London, but these are enjoyable.
Monday Morning Yum Cha at Jurong Point. The HK Custard Crust Bun (冰火菠萝包), Mini Egg Tarts, Steamed Custard Buns, Steamed Rice Rolls and the Sauteed Turnip Cake with XO sauce are pretty good.
This was the \'portion\' size, at $14.80. Look at that glistening shiny skin! Tasty but had too much fats for my liking. I liked the crispy pork belly more! 
Tell me how to resist this combi? Crispy bo luo bao and that flowing salted egg yolk! The filling could be more but mmm it was yummy! 
I had the soup one too but the soup was too bland. This dry version is better and for both versions you get to choose from different noodles - thin/thick egg noodles or flat/thin rice noodles. This thin egg noodles were q and not clumpy although the amount of sauce given could have been more generous! 
#HongKong, oh how I\'ve missed you. Our reunion has yet to materialise, but these will do for now.
A tad too gamy and fatty for my liking; similar to the one I had at Gold Mine in London.
The legendary Hong Kong restaurant has arrived in Singapore and has attracted the stomachs of fellow Singaporeans. Authentic setting and friendly service, this roast duck brought smiles to our faces. The meat was too dry or tough and the skin was crispy throughout. But the second time around, the sauce was a little too salty for our likings.
A taste of HK in SG. Stir fried nissin noodle with luncheon meat. Tasty!
Happy humpday, errbardy!
Been a fan of Legendary Hong Kong\'s crusty-topped bo lo bao since day 1, and now they\'ve one-upped themselves with a bo lo bao that spews molten salted egg yolk custard. WHAT SORCERY IS THIS?! So, so, so, so good.
Easily the best polo bun I\'ve ever had in Singapore, this is an absolute must-try. Baked to perfection, the crusty exterior envelopes a warm, soft and mildly sweet bun between a slab of sweet butter that melts in the mouth. It’s so good you won’t want to share. And you shouldn\'t.
Twin roast meat rice combo ($8.80) with roast duck and sio bak. Quite pricey after gst and service charge, sio bak is really soft and juocu while the duck is pretty average.
Tea Break time!
The roasted meat were dried and under seasoned. .\n<br />|\n<br />Thankful the egg tart and yuan yang saved the day.
Although it was not those flowing lava type of custard bun that I wanted but overall it still taste great with its fragrant egg custard and fluffy soft bun skin. #cuisineparadiseeatout #dimsum
The sugar buttery Po Luo Bun that melts right in your mouth which creates an overwhelming experience just like a bunch of people partying inside!
Thoroughly enjoy all the food here! Most of them are quite good except for the Liu Sha Bao &amp; Char Sao Bao which my friends &amp; I felt are the fillings are not that good. The Yuan Yang drink here is one of the best I ever drank! A great dinner! \n<br />#burpple #legendaryhongkong #jurongpoint #hongkongstyle #cafecumresturant #dimsum
Had always wanted to try it out but the queue during meal times are always so long!!! At last went there early slightly before dinner time! Didn\'t regret and enjoy being there! Food are great &amp; the setting and atmosphere feel almost Hong Kong like! Most probably one of the best if not the best Hong Kong cafe in SG! \n<br />#burpple #legendaryhongkong #jurongpoint #hongkongstyle #cafecumresturant
Love the silky egg yolk custard in the crisp pastry shells.
Sorry for the out of focus photo, but this was soooooo good!
The milk tea i have to say is damn powerful, drank at 8pm and couldn\'t sleep till it was 9 in the morning 😱 the roast meat was superb!!!
Found this at Legendary Hong Kong at Jurong Point 2, which also serves other dim sum favs such as BBQ Pork Bun, Pork Ribs, Beef Balls and Pan-fried Turnip Cakes.
If you\'re unable to go all the way to Hong Kong to have an awesome bo luo bao, a simple journey to the far west of Singapore (Jurong Point) will do the trick. As Tastemaker Rachel Xie says, \"perfectly crispy, sugary crust moulded to soft, slightly buttery bread. Complete this classic HK breakfast with the finely balanced yuan yang\". If you want something more substantial for lunch, go for the noodles with luncheon meat and egg, a classic cha chan teng option using noodles imported from HK!
Had to queue 20-30mins before I was seated down. HK style milk tea ($2.8) and HK style yuan yang ($2.8) was alright. As i could sense a flu coming, I tried a coke with lemon and ginger ($3.5) which just tasted like hot coke.... BBQ twin combo ($16.8) where you could choose from roasted duck, char siew, pork belly and chicken from which we tried the first two, tbh, I have tried better ones from markets/coffee shops (definitely not worth the money!!!! 😡😭😪). HK style French toast ($3) which the staff recommended but it tasted really bland.... I could do better... Really. Braised e-fu noodle ($9.8), decent. Custard crust bun (bo luo bao) ($1.3) - this was good. I like it. Crispy and fragrant with the right amount of butter inside. Steamed sponge cake ($4) - this was good as well, soft and fluffy!! Also tried turnip cake w xo sauce ($5.5), chick claw in black bean sauce ($4), rice roll with BBQ pork ($5) - these wasn\'t too bad. Honey &amp; Pomelo tea ($2.8), bad, overly sweet even on the first sip.... Total bill came up to $71.85 after svc chg and gst. I would expect more with the amount I paid..... Maybe cause it was dinner time and the restaurant was busy that\'s why the standard wasn\'t really there? 😔😔
The one at Taste Paradise is far and beyond the best, but this one, while not perfect, isn\'t bad either. I\'d have liked a crisper sear on the surfaces, but the cubes of cake had the right, slightly buoyant texture that eventually melts away in the mouth. Pair these with the fragrant XO chilli sauce, which is absolutely to die for. 
The ducks are imported from temperate Ireland, so they\'re a lot more fatty and tender than the ones we usually get locally, which are sourced from Malaysia. To do these precious ducks justice, they\'ve got in a chef (his resume includes a stint at the famous Yung Kee in HK) to roast them to succulent perfection, then douse them in a tantalising sauce infused with spices and aromatics – it took them 30 whole ducks to get the dish just right. 
We heard that the chefs here are from Hong Kong. You don\'t have to fly to HK for authentic dim sum. 
Another of my favourites here has you tiao wrapped in thin rice rolls and served in light soy sauce. 
pigging in out. this newly opened cha chan ting is 👍👍👍 .. chefs from hongkong. what more can we ask for.
gorgeous state of a bo luo bao. I can proudly proclaim to my fellow singaporeans, there is no need to fly to hk for kum wah bo luo bao. we finally have ours in singapore. so happy. so satisfied
Good morning, folks! So excited to be heading back to this authentic cha chan teng where even the \"doll\" noodles are imported from Hong Kong; the taste is way different from the Malaysian-imported ones. 
Did someone say butter? Best eaten with a lavish drizzling of syrup for that sweet-salty balance. 😍
So a bunch of Hong Kongers (probably dripping with money) decided they needed the authentic flavours of their motherland in Singapore and personally scouted 8 chefs from Hong Kong, each with an impressive 14-31 years of experience under his belt. \n<br />This po lo bao is the best I\'ve had in Singapore, with a perfectly crispy, sugary crust moulded to soft, slightly buttery bread. Complete this classic HK breakfast with the finely balanced yuan yang (brewed by a chef with over 20 years specialisation in teas – he considers serving milk tea that\'s been brewed for less than 20min an abomination), which has just right touches of coffee, tea, milk and sugar. 
Part of the new Mongkok-themed shopping district at Jurong Point, Legendary Hong Kong is not just a place for Hong Kong food, but the place to solve all your crazy cravings for Hong Kong cuisine simply for its wide and impressive variety served. Legendary Hong Kong comprises of four stalls; a Noodle &amp; Porridge stall, Dim Sum stall, Tea Room (opening in September) and a Roast Meat stall with a 230 seat dining area that boasts different themes ranging from a Chinese restaurant to a typical Hong Kong Tea Room so each visit there would feel like as if its in a different venue. Prices might be a bit higher than usual dim sum restaurants but the portion sizes are also more generous in comparison. If you are spoilt for choice, go for the honeyed tender London Roast Duck here that comes in portion, half or even whole which comes with a tangy citron sauce that makes it all the better. Currently running in soft launch mode, expect some items to be unavailable; but honestly the spread available is so varied it probably ain\'t an issue at all.
Essentially Yuan Yang. Seemed pretty diluted as it was weak in both coffee and tea flavours.

Whisked into Hong Kong just by entering this really busy shop in Jurong Point. Their Custard Crust Bun or more commonly known as Bo Luo Buns are just amazing, and come in a great variety. We ordered the standard one with butter, as well as the salted egg filled one (3 small ones for $5) and they were both absolutely amazing, especially the crust on top. The salted egg one was crisp and warm - mmmmmm.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#dimsum #boluobao #legendaryhongkong #jurongpoint #saltedegg #food #foodstagram #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodgasm #foodspotting #instafood #instagood #instagramers #yummy #amazing #iphonesia #lefooding @lefooding #picoftheday #photooftheday #igdaily #sgeats #sgfood #whati8today #iweeklyfood #eatoutsg #burpple

Available for the first time in Singapore at #legendaryhongkong in #jurongpoint , you can pick your choice of noodles which is then cooked instantly, followed by a selection of sides and toppings and sauces. Includes exotic stuff like pig intestines, briskets, chicken wings, braised eggs, mushrooms, pig skins, meatballs etc the selections are dazzling. Finished off with satay or curry sauces. The imported egg noodles was superb and great QQ boing boing texture that u can almost bounce a 50 cent coin off. One bowl will likely set u back 5 to 7 dollars, but the portions are huge and for my money, way better than their competition in both quality and quantity :)\n<br />#cartnoodles #hongkongfood #noodles #eggnoodles #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple

I like my plate of fried turnip cake with XO sauce. The duck platter was abit fatty and i\'m not a chee cheong fun person. The milktea is thick enough for me.
The feel is so familiar, the food is so familiar, even the accent seems so familiar. Momentarily brought myself to Hong Kong - right here in Singapore.

Turnip cake with xo sauce. Another excellent dish .
Have you came down to Hong Kong Street at Jurong Point yet? Do experience it at least once, the layout &amp; ambience is about the same to the real Hong Kong as per what my friend said. Do try the Bolo Bun which is so crispy! They are well known for their roasted pork &amp; char siew, even thou I didn\'t try it, will be back again!
