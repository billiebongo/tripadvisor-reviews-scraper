Nostalgia comes in the form of cake! That familiar-looking strawberry cake that comes with coloured gel with various fruity flavours. The one here was not particularly artificial-tasting, keeping a more balanced sweetness instead.
The famous lychee martini cake. Very subtle taste of alcohol but I am not complaining.
Sponge was light and fluffy. Not too sweet. It was a pretty good cake.
My favourite lychee martini cake! Although the martini taste isn\'t as strong as I remember, but this is the only time I would eat a cream cake. The pulut hitam cake was really delightful with it\'s coconut cream as well! Love how the cakes are not too sweet ^^
The Pulut Hitam cake which left me wanting for more! Its so good!!
Perhaps I grew up from my childhood days eating these confectionery cakes, but cakes nowadays cannot hold a candle to these old school ones that holds so many memories for me. ♥️ #nolstagia
Finally got to try the \"legendary\" lychee martini cake, all thanks to a very sweet colleague who brought this specially to the office! :) Very subtle hint of lychee martini, fluffy soft bite and not too sweet.
This unassuming bakery will surprise you with its variety, affordability and quality. It is rare to find a neighbourhood bakery that does such unique buttercream variations, and Pine Garden does it remarkably well. Popular flavours include their Lychee Martini Cake, Black Forest Cake and their innovative Pulut Hitam Cake, which will leave you wanting more ($2.50 each). These guys even do custom wedding and birthday cakes along with Asian pastries!
hazelnut cake, avocado gula melaka, mango passionfruit, rainbow jelly cake.  I can\'t really remember the names of the cakes, but pine garden\'s cakes are quite over-hyped? The cakes are ordinary and quite dry, do not taste as good as it looks
