You should know that Seorae was featured in their show. Seorae is a Korean BBQ where you can chill and enjoy good BBQ food with your friends.\n<br />Seorae is having a late night promotion!\n<br />Customer who dine in from 8.30pm onwards will get to choose to enjoy 2 Soju Bombs (worth $20) or 1 Pattinson free with every minimum of $60 spent.
Isn\'t it nice to see all the meats chilling in harmony on the grill! Okay maybe not chilling...
Well-loved for its perfect combination of tender juiciness, with minimal amount of fats! This unique cut forms only 250 grams of a full grown pig and was strictly reserved for Korean royalties in olden days.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Thank you @seoraesg for having us and @blessincasia for the invitation.
üë®üèªüë©üèªüëßüèª Ended up at Seorae just cos it was featured in Descendants of the Sun ‚òÄÔ∏è LOL. Seorae is the only restaurant in Singapore that serves pork skirt meat (galmaegisal) and I must say it was rly damn good!! Our ultimate pork set came w lots of cuts of meat incl. U.S. pork jowl, pork belly (samgyupsal) + soondubu/beancurd stew and naengmyun woo üá∞üá∑üá∞üá∑üá∞üá∑
We had a wonderful Sinsa Patbingsoo (Rock Melon + Pat + Vanilla Ice Cream) last night at Seorae Singapore at PS! The long wait was worth it as the ice was so fine, red bean was just nice, not too sweet and rock melon was sweet! Great combi! @niciaddl @seoraesg #seorae #seoraesg #patbingsoo #rockmelon
Seorae rock melon bingsu ,look so yummy but was totally disappointed ,cost sgd 14.90 ,but find it totally no worth ,still prefer Ice lab bingsu!
Ordering the ultimate pork set @SGD79.00++,suitable for 2-3 pax ,the set come with rice wine (makkolli)mix ,the taste quite special and smoothly ,the US Pork Jowl is so damn good ,but portion was small ,there is free flow of egg but pls note that egg cooking time is long ,might only refill twice during the whole dinner ,we cook the egg with cheese ...so yummy ,is worth trying ,come with a group ,enjoy the soju and chit chat time :)cheers !Overall Rating :3.5/5
Sweet Melon more than ice. üëçüèª just one thing I hope they can improve of, serviceüëéüèª. Having a real hard time to get attention of the waiter, they are Super not attentive. The only attentive ones are the waitress (the only lady server) and the head Chef. Obviously lack of training and man power. -M
THE DESSERT MENU.\n<br />What sweeter ending to a hearty BBQ than this gorgeous bowl of Sinsa Patbingsoo? Aside from the great texture of the shaved ice and the creamy ice cream, I loved the generous serving of melon, which was pleasantly sweet. Definitely bang for your buck at $14.90. \n<br />For the overworked souls, Seorae has a great promotion for late night dining. From 8.30pm onwards, customers who dine-in at Seorae get to enjoy 2 Soju Bombs (worth $20.00) OR 1 Patbingsoo free with $60 minimum spend. \n<br />Now, this is a promotion I\'ll definitely go for after a tiring day at work! \n<br />Many thanks for @geekyelephant for the invite and @greekhoney for taking such good care of our tummies.
\nWith Seorae\'s newly-launched Late Night Dining promotion, there\'s all the more reason to indulge in a good meal on any week night. When you dine in from 8.30pm onwards, you get to pick either 2 complimentary glasses of soju (worth $20) or a complimentary Patbingsoo (if you spend $60 and above). During dinner last night, we feasted on several dishes of theirs and I must say, I was impressed by the overall quality of the food here. Below is a shortlist of the items that stood out for me personally:
üôãüèª It\'s actually {Bibim Patbingsoo} - $12.90 with the likes of kiwi, strawberries, red beans, nata de coco and an \"egg\", resting on a bed of shaved ice. Drizzle over the \"Gochujang\" (jam) mix and enjoy üéâ\n<br />#seoraesg #plazasingapura #PSinstameetApril #rachyyadverts
Beautiful smokin\' hot Jinkkotsal ‚Äî the wagyu beef boneless short-ribs that simply melts in your mouth! The wagyu beef was easily polished off even after already having multiple servings of meat. Just can\'t get enough of this! You could also pair it with their bean paste, onion soy sauce, spicy sauce or kimchi but I\'d say just have it on its own. 
A satisfying Korean BBQ with well-marinated meats and great company to talk about anything under the sun (including but not limited to Descendants of the Sun). The free flow of fluffy egg omelette was really good too, I dare say better than WDB.
Let\'s put it this way - the Bibim Patbingsu just looks too good to be eaten, it is simply a work of art!! However, when you start to mesh everything together (just like any other Bingsu), feeling slightly heartache from ruining this, you will not regret eating it. There is just different kinds of fruits inside that, when eaten with the shaved ice, brings this rice fruity taste to it. What\'s more - when you mix in with the cream from the \"egg\" on top of the Bingsu and eat it with the fruits, the taste and texture is nice. As with all Bingsus the price is about the same, but it is certainly great to refresh yourself with this (especially through the fruits) after having all that meat from Korean BBQ. The other one we had was the Dongdaemun Patbingsu and this is for all who love 1) bananas and 2) ovaltine. This was good as well, but the Bibim Patbingsu with all that fruit is still the better option. Well... To each his/her own! :)
Haemul Pajeon, traditional Korean pancake with fresh green onions and succulent seafood. The pancake was fluffy and flavoursome while the ‚Äúcrust‚Äù was super crispy.
There\'s cheese to compliment it. And what\'s more is that there\'s free flow of egg üòç shiok max -M
It‚Äôs the perfect balance of both worlds. It has marbling similar to a beef rib-eye steak, just enough fat to soak up flavor but not so much that it leave ur mouth greasy like Samgyeopsal does. It has a firm bouncy texture and contains no tiny bones. Sometimes I find Samgyeopsal (pork belly) being too tough to Chew on if not cooked right.  definitely going back for more of their Yakult soju and hangjeongsal -M
Not fond of buffets, I have found the place to satisfy my cravings for bulgogi and spicy pork belly. Service is good too though come prepared for a wait during peak periods. Totally yums! Definitely worth a visit back 
I think so.
As said, the $59.90 set comes with their famous pork skirt meat, and two types of beef as the photo! Guess that\'s enough for 3-4 person but for my visit is only 2 of us, and we were bloated the whole long day. Anyway, the bbq comes with steamed egg and cheese, but too bad, the refill charges $2 for each. Anyway, nice the marinated meat was good, but the side dishes were not amaze me. Haha
It\'s just $21.90++ for 2 pax for either the pork or beef Korean BBQ set, which comes along with rice, side dishes and soft drinks! OMO OMO so affordable!
Huhu @modgam, I\'m sending my love JUST TODAY. OR FOR THE HOUR.
Not particularly impressed with the food and the service was not up to expectation. Firstly, there were empty tables yet everyone in the line was made to wait at least five minutes for them to rearrange the tables for us to take seats. Secondly, they forgot to serve items in the set. Thirdly, they only remembered to give us the scissors and tongs halfway through our meals. Not going to comment on the food.
Overrated Korean BBQ. Meat quality was worse than a normal BBQ place.
üòç
Well marinated pork skirt meat grilled to perfect, yum yum. Juicy moist and flavourful üòãüòãüòã
The deep yellow cheese strands did not hide their desire for InstaMouse fame and the orange crumbs were essentially reincarnations of everybody\'s favourite childhood Super Ring snack, but overall the bingsoo adhered law-abidingly to sweet dessert OB markers. 3.5/5
South Korea\'s Seorae Galmaegi chain has finally taken root in Singapore, on the second floor of Plaza Singapura. This sprawling Korean BBQ house is best known for serving Galmaegisal ($21.90 for 170g, $29.90 for 270g), an exclusive pork skirt meat that was only served to royalty in the olden times. This small, precious cut of meat is found between the ribs and belly, and an adult pig only yields 250grams. Enjoy this rare treat, alongside other marinated meats like beef ribs and pork belly. Chilli lovers can also opt for the Spicy Galmaegisal ($22.90 for 170g, $31.90 for 270g). Charcoal is used instead of gas, and a circling grilling technique is employed by the staff, ensuring perfectly grilled meats. Don\'t miss the Three Musketeers ($31.90) that features original, spicy and soy sauce-flavoured pork belly. Quietly cooking on the outside of the grill is a moat of silky smooth eggs and a pool of molten cheese, perfect for dipping your meats into! Classic Korean meals like Mul Nangmyeon Noodles ($14.90) and Sundubu Jjigae ($14.90) are also available. Come for lunch on weekdays with your colleagues for the Dosirak Set ($9.90), a Korean-style packed lunch akin to bibimbap, served in a thin metal tin that you\'re meant to shake up, complete with free flow side dishes and a soft drink. End off with the refreshing Apgujeong Bingsoo ($14.90), which comes topped with thick-cut cheesecake and vanilla ice cream covered with cheese sprinkles!
While the galmaegisal (pork skirt meat) and various pork and beef cuts would easily satisfy ravenous K-Meat lovers, my personal favourite is their spicy pork belly, which demonstrates a wicked brimstone feist seldom seen in local Korean BBQ joints.
Patbingsoo named after the areas in Korea and this is Sinsa - Honeydew, red beans &amp; vanilla ice cream üç® Fluffy shaved ice with sweet honeydew balls, but the ice got progressively lumpy as we ate the portion that is within the honeydew \"bowl\". Definitely needs improvement! 
Come to Seorae to experience authentic Korean barbecue. Charcoal is used in the grilling process, which just seems to make the meat tastier! This is Seorae\'s signature Galmaegisal; pork skirt meat marinated with Korean spices. Careful not to over cook it to fully experience the tenderness and juiciness! This cut of meat is not as fatty too, just perfect for me. All barbecue comes with a bubbling egg around the charcoal grill. Cheese at an additional $2!
2016 is the year of \"No time wasters\" for me. \n<br />But anyway, I also hope that 2016 is a year where we get food that looks AND taste good. Is it so hard to achieve? \n<br />This bingsu looking like a bibimbap has such coarse ice, that we gave up and just ate the toppings.
This cut of pork is famous for being juicy and tender despite minimal fats. A must try for sure. The fluffy eggs cooked on the side of the grill is also very flavorful, a good complement to the grilled meats. We also had the matcha patbingsoo which came with a generous scoop of matcha ice cream and matcha powder on top - a cooling way to end off a hearty meal! The staff are also very friendly and prompt with their service. Visit now for the opening promo and receive a $38 return voucher with $80 spent.
Well-loved for its perfect combination of tender juiciness, with minimal amount of fats! This unique cut forms only 250 grams of a full grown pig and was strictly reserved for Korean royalties in olden days. Tonight can eat like a king!

Always love the refillable side dishes at korean restaurants. Been wanting to try this shop for quite sometimes. Their kimchi is on point and the egg. Added cheese for $2, so cute that they have refillable 3 more times policy, egg also can top up 3 times. The main dish so-so. Even the army stew felt like a let down. Stew with 2 bbq meats set 59++. I would rather try the premium meat next time. #koreanfood #sidedish #sgfood #burpple #igsg

The pineapple taste removed the \"thinner\" taste from the Soju and have a nice pulpy feel!
Those who have no affinity towards seafood can order the Kimchi Jeon (oso $17.9); traditional Korean pancake with slices of pork belly + home-made kimchi! Thumbs up to the Sundubu Jjigae ($14.9) too; a spicy soft tofu stew mixed with minced pork, fresh vegetables, clams &amp; eggs.

It\'s rare &amp; expensive because a full grown pig only produces 250 grams of Galmaegisal hence, it\'s exclusively for royalties during ancient times!\n<br />~\n<br />In frame\'s the Garlic Soy-Sauce Galmaegisal ($21.9); there\'s oso the Original &amp; a Spicy version (all same price). Fickle minded ones can oso choose the King Galmaegisal 3 in 1 ($29.9 270 grams / $49.9 500 grams).\n<br />~\n<br />Other meats we\'d of noteworthy includes the Samgyeobsal aka Pork Belly (there\'s Original &amp; Hangari but we tried the Spicy; all $17.9).

Chef Chul Park, the Founder of¬≠ Seorae, attributes the success in the hi¬≠ghly competitive market of Korean BBQ, to¬≠ the company‚Äôs basic philosophy of provid¬≠ing diners with the best quality ingredie¬≠nts and produce, while maintaining the ar¬≠t of Korean barbeque. Another unique aspe¬≠ct is that Seorae serves Galmaegisal, whi¬≠ch translates to ‚Äúskirt meat‚Äù, a cut with¬≠ minimal amount of fat (great for waist-w¬≠atchers) while possessing the perfect rat¬≠io of tenderness and juiciness. A fully-g¬≠rown cow or pig only produces about 250g ¬≠of such prized meat, which was in the pas¬≠t, strictly reserved for Korean royalties. \n<br />#seorae #seoraesg #koreanbbq #bbq #instafood #foodstagram #sharefood #foodspotting #sgfood #sgfoodie #fooddiaries #onthetable #instayum #yummers #whatiate #whati8today #sgigfoodie #eatoutsg #burpple #openricesg #sgeats #instagramsg #sgig #igsg #sgblog #sgblogger #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore
Meltingly juicy. Juicily luscious. And so on.
4.5 munchies: Marinated with Seorae\'s special spicy sauce and grilled to golden brown perfection, these thick, fatty slices of pork belly meat were so lip-smackingly crispy and addictive! The samgyeopsal is best eaten wrapped in a lettuce and dipped with the savoury, spicy ssamjang. I\'d also highly recommend the soju bomb and honeydew patbingsoo to complete the Seorae Galmaegi dining experience.
