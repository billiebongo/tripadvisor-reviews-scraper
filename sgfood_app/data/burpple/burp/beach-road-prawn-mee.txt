I have often wondered of the difference in prawns the $2 buys you. So I decided to find out once and for all.\n<br />Jumbo Prawns, also known as \"Special Big Prawns\", are tiger prawns that come from the sea, while Big Prawns are the locally farmed version. There is definitely a difference in the taste although it\'s subtle. Jumbo Prawns have a touch more flavour than Big Prawns. For those of you who like the pinky-orange roe, the former seems to have more of it as well. The texture of the flesh is about the same between the two. \n<br />Although this place seems to draw a never-ending stream of customers, I have to admit I\'ve never been that impressed with the prawn noodles here. For me, it is the soup that matters most. And I judge it based on how much condiments (chilli powder, sliced chilli padi etc) I DON\'T need to chuck in to get it to my liking. Brewing the sweetest, most flavourful of soups takes skill and experience. So far, the two stalls that get my vote are \"Dadong\" at Joo Chiat and \"Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodles\" at \"Pek Kio\" market. Their soups are the cream of the crop according to my tastebuds. 
The broth is so flavourful and incomparable to any others I\'ve tried. The essence of the prawn fully infused into the soup, and huge juicy fresh prawns to go along with it | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
I always adore prawn noodles, but what I look for is the broth. Then I must say, this broth - really good! Thick and flavourful. Generous serving of 3 pieces of prawns (they are pretty huge, not those tiny ones). I never liked yellow noodles but I found it well-cooked - springy and just right! I wish I could just have the soup &amp; the prawns right now~ üòå
Gotta have the medium sized one.
Best Prawn Mee, I tried Jumbo bow. The prawn so nice, soup is great.
Been coming here since I was in kindergarten. Never fails!! :D
Probably not the best in Singapore but still worth a try!
One of the best prawn noodles I\'ve tasted. Not too salty or powdery. #food #foodporn
Excellent for a rainy morning.
Pricey with dismal ingredients, but still one of my favorite soup broths. 
Fresh and sweet prawns. Soup is great too comparable to other good prawn noodle places. Must try but prepare to wait as queue is long especially on weekends. 
Still one of the best in SIngapore. Personally, more desirable/ enjoyable than the prawn noodle which is the usual main draw to this coffee shop.
üî∏üî∏\n<br />Used to be good. Noodles bland and chilli even tho I had extra, was far from spicy. My lunch kaki commented that standards plunged. He had the noodle soup and all I could see was a lot of noodles and where is the soup?  Even amount of soup was reduced. Was it worth the price???\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Let\'s say we wont be craving for this particular prawn noodle in the near future.
Love the jumbo prawn noodles! Worth every dollar spent
Plump prawns and tender pork ribs but the broth is not as rich as Da Dong and Jalan Sultan. ü§§\n<br />.\n<br />Some say it‚Äôs one of the best or the best in town, but I‚Äôd beg to differ. It‚Äôs good don‚Äôt get me wrong, a place you can rely on and their efficiency is pretty eye opening, no matter what time you come the place seems to be always full of patrons. Get a plate of Ngoh Hiang (Chinese Rojak) that share the same roof to go along with your Prawn Noodles. üîñ\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #beachroadprawnmee #prawnmee #prawn #umami #ngohiong #ËôæÈù¢ #ngohiang #jalansultanprawnmee #porkribs

.\n<br />It seems the packet version here is much better compare to the dine in version. Noodles portion are more, huge tiger prawns about 1.5 pcs plus generous serving of the robust prawn broth.

// Broth had very thick and rich prawn flavour, pork Rib was very tender, together with fried lard bits and fried shallots, made the noodles even tastier. Fresh prawns which was crunchy and sweet.\n<br />Ngor hiang was perfect, each of the items were well fried and the prawn crackers were really crispy The mixture of the sweet starchy pink sauce and the chilli sauce really enhanced the taste of the food. Its a very large place so getting a table won\'t be a problem and loads of parking around the area! \n<br />Prawn&amp;PorkRib noodle {$8.80}\n<br />Ngor-Hiang, each item ranged from {$0.80-$2.20}//\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood#sgfood#sgeats#foodporn#makansg#prawnnoodles#ngorhiang#‰∫îÈ¶ô#yummy#delicious#burpple#sgig#foodstagram#food#foodie#instagood#instahappy#foodislife#foodexplore#instafood_sg
A shelter from the rains. A little \"me\" time #inmybackyard\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />This eatery used to be one of my favorites #inmyhood but alas, the standard is somewhat different. I remembered way back then... the outrageous queue and the long wait for food, the \"kick ass\" chilli dip. What is on my plate.. tofu was okay whereas the rest was simply salty. The \"kick ass\" chilli has lost its heat and tasted more sweet than spicy. Still a decent meal nevertheless.
Decided to go for the jumbo this time at 11.80 for bigger prawns

Went straight for a bowl of Prawn Noodles with Pork Ribs ($5.80) paired with an assortment of Ngor Hiang. The prawn soup was slightly salty but I am not complaining after the mediocre \"Thai\" food in Krabi (guess they have altered the taste to suit the mass foreigners). #FOODART #local #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #julsmakan #jiakholiao #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #foodie #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #vsco #vscocam #vscofood #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #prawn #noodles #beachroadprawnnoodles
