These are Yamame Trout roe. \n<br />Smaller sized, deliciously unique taste. They are \"less sticky\" and milder tasting than red ikura (so you can have more!)

For the grand finale, a handroll filled with with rich and creamy Mursaki Uni. Very generous portions given by Kimura san!
So oishii! Chef Tomoo, thank you for a lovely, lovely Omakase lunch! We truly enjoyed ourselves.
I was so happy when Chef Tomoo told me he still had some and I could try it today. Sujiko is basically salmon roe in the egg sac. This is another sign that autumn has arrived. Don\'t you think they look so pretty? Little red pearls glistening away?
This was so beautifully cut, almost like a flower.
ÁßãÂàÄÈ≠ö or autumn swordfish is  red meat fish and here, it\'s served with negi.
From the left, clockwise : Meichi-dai (a rare snapper, my first time trying this), shima aji, buri and chutoro. Today\'s buri is from Hokkaido, over 10kg.  The Japanese amberjack is called hamachi until they grow to 5kgs, then they are called buri. As winter approaches, they grow a lot fattier. Yummy!
Loved this course! In fact when it was served, I thought it was beef. When fish tastes this good, there\'s no need for Wagyu.
Really enjoyed both fishes today and I could smell how smokey the katsuo was. The sashimi course reflected the changing seasons as these fishes often make an appearance towards autumn.
So today I learned that besides using pure Hokkaido water for the dashi, the ratio of dashi to egg, the other point to note is the freshness of the eggs used. Fresh eggs will cook faster.
It\'s been a while since I\'ve been back here for sushi and so happy to see this sight today and of course, Chefs Tomoo and Akane.
Here he\'s showing us the sujiko before preparing it to be used as neta.
I don\'t even know where to begin. I\'m not usually one to splurge (this much) on lunch but the occasion called for it. Let\'s just say, it was money well spent. The attention to detail, the precision in preparation and the quality of every ingredient made for sure a great dining experience. üòç
This thoughtful dessert is created by @akane.eno, every part of it is so good.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Chef Akane first toasted the monako (a traditional Japanese wafer), then laid half of it on Houjicha pudding (on the left) and another half on the Hokkaido azuki (on the right). The texture of the Houjicha pudding was amazing, it\'s velvety smooth like panna cotta, and it had that roasted tea scent.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />We were encouraged to spread some Houjicha and Azuki together with the two halves of monako and eat them like a sandwich. While all of them are great on its own, eating them together melds all the dimensions together beautifully.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />üî∏
No explanation needed, really. This was divine. I was genuinely sad when this dish ended.
This, surprisingly, was one of my favourite items served as part of the Hagi menu. This beautifully grilled king salmon and micro tomatoes was exquisite. I wouldn\'t say salmon is my favourite fish, but this was prepared in a way that it tasted smoked (though it wasn\'t) - it was rich and salty. Apparently this is done so that it pairs well with sake. ü§§
This has to be my favorite item in the omakase, and during lunch this is only available in the $250 menu. Whole abalone is simmered in sake for 8 hours, then sliced and brightened with yuzu zest. Sweet and succulent, it was tender yet firm to the bite.
One that is worth every calorie. Lightly toasted monaka, azuki beans, hojicha (roasted tea) pudding and muscat grapes. I have had this at an earlier visit, with strawberries and loved it. I made a sandwich with my monaka and kept wishing that the last bite would not come. So, so, so delicious! Chefs Tomoo and Akane, thank you for a lovely, lovely Omakase.
He asked me,\" Have you ever had ika (squid) with cucumber rolls?\" When I said no, he kindly ordered a round for all of us to try. It was very good. Refreshing and crunchy!
Crunchy seaweed, handchopped toro with negi laced into it and kanpyo to give you the added crunch. Each bite is sheer bliss!
This makes my heart sing! I truly, truly love Botan Ebi soup!
Shima aji, kinmedai belly (so rich and oily), chutoro and aged otoro
It\'s amazing the amount of attention to detail that sushi chefs have. Both pleasing to the eye and the palate. For our grilled dish, we had the Noduguro, my favourite. It was smokey and oily. So good. This time we had it with Uni salt, micro tomatoes, edamame and grilled Kyoto Manganji peppers.
Only because it was simmered for many hours in sake. Oishii!
To our sheer delight, it was Hokkaido sweet corn (it is summer after all) and crab. This was so good. We were all left wishing the last spoonful would never end.
No matter how many times I\'ve had this, I\'ll never get tired of it. Perhaps it signifies for me, the beginning of a wonderful Omakase meal ahead?
The road to become a sushi chef isn\'t easy. I once asked a sushi chef why does it take so many years and he told me that there\'s just so much to learn and master. For instance, the neta - if you offer what\'s seasonal, you need to know what is the best way to present it. Which cut, do you cure it or age it? What goes best with it? As the Chef explained to me, I can see why it takes so many years of training. It\'s uncommon for women to become sushi chefs and so Chef @akane.eno, I salute you.
I also like their sushi, particularly this red sea bream sushi with the fish sitting elegantly on the rice. Generally, I like the size and freshness of the fish served.. with this piece also sprinkled with some uni salt. Each piece lovingly prepared by chef @akane.eno, served with a smile.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />All omakase came with sushi. Our $250++ omakase also consists of a uni yuba starter, chawanmushi with Hokkaido corn and Hokkaido crab, a sake simmered abalone, a cooked sea perch, 4 types of sashimi, 8 pieces of sushi, their signature uni ikura onsen egg rice bowl and a dessert.
Had a wonderful omakase last weekend at Sushi Kimura with Chef @tomosushiiii and Chef @akane.eno. The food was good, but it\'s more than the food. The chefs completed the whole experience with their personality, and we felt connected with them.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />My set consists of a starter, a chawanmushi, an abalone, a cooked dish, 4 types of sashimi, 8 pieces of sushi, their signature rice bowl and a dessert. Pictured is red sea perch with uni salt. So good. More photos to follow.
For high-end sushi meals, the kind that costs three figures even without alcohol, my preferred restaurant right now is Sushi Kimura. What I like about this place (it was introduced to me by @angelineongsuming) is that beyond the excellent sushi, their omasake and set menus include interesting gems that are very well executed. \n<br />Chef @tomosushiiii sources only the freshest seafood to create his dishes. So depending on the season, you can expect courses to differ when you visit throughout the year. \n<br />For example, I have had the chawanmushi three times and on each visit, it has been steamed with different ingredients. The most recent one featured Hokkaido sweet corn and crab meat in the slinky-silk egg, which I have to say, is my favourite so far. \n<br />It was the same for the monaka dessert which had Muscat grapes replace the gigantic strawberry of my previous omakase meal. \n<br />One of the items on the menu that remains a welcome constant is their signature rice bowl. In this, you will find a gorgeous creamy blend of beaten onsen eggs, freshest Ikura and uni. I do know though of a regular customer who prefers his with the components unmixed.

This was something I had not been served before on my two previous visits to Sushi Kimura. Thus, I was instantly captivated.\n<br />Even before I could pick up a single item from this wooden platter to nibble on, my eyes were busy devouring the beauty set before me. Yet nothing could beat the actual consumption of the Red Japanese Sea Perch which I broke apart, then lightly dabbed, a piece at a time, in the orangey Uni Salt before letting it slip between my lips. Grilled to a light crisp of skin, the fish had flesh that\'s full of flavour, and was slightly oily and sensuously moist. It was very delicious indeed.\n<br />The Mangaji pepper from Kyoto, edamame and sweet micro tomatoes were well curated for their enhancement to savouring the fish.
I can\'t say I have met a more glamorous trio of shishamos (pregnant fish) in my life. Chef Tomoo accessorised them very fittingly, with sesame seeds and... wait for it... micro tomatoes! Unfortunately klutzy me allowed one of them (the tomato, not the fish) to escape while trying to separate it from the minuscule branch. I hope that tiny runaway has been found so it doesn\'t become a splodge on the floor.
Here\'s another unique item I had at Sushi Kimura - the Tairagai or Japanese Pen Shell.\n<br />Once this is handed to you, it must be eaten in a matter of seconds. Otherwise you aren\'t maximising its \"oishii-ness\" (deliciousness) potential.\n<br />Due to having been grilled over charcoal, the large oval slice of shellfish was fragrant with a faint smokiness. I like how it tasted - a slightly firmer and savoury version of the more common scallop if you will.\n<br />Eating it immediately also ensured the toasted seaweed was shatteringly crispy when I bit into it, which definitely added to the pleasure.
I chose to have the $180++ omakase lunch on my second visit here with Burppler Angeline Ong .\n<br />Like my first time here, Chef-owner Tomoo served us a series of stunningly good seasonal items prepared in the most meticulous manner along with his must-have signatures. \n<br />One of the early dishes to be set before me was this beautiful bowl by a Singapore artist cradling smoked bonito and shako (mantis shrimp). Arranged with sprigs of delicately peppery shiso flowers, baby lotus root, another pale green vegetable (its name has slipped my mind) and a smidgen of freshly grated wasabi root, it was quite a sight to behold. And then I promptly got over its beauty and waded in with my chopsticks.\n<br />That\'s when things got really spectacular.
I was flabbergasted by Chef Tomoo\'s pursuit of perfection for his \"by-special-request\" negitoro handroll. It extends to him having his seaweed made-to-order with an artisanal supplier in Japan!\n<br />But after seeing how carefully he minces the otoro (fatty tuna) by hand, then meticulously slices the Japanese leek into the most minute shreds to mix them together, before assembling them with rice and a couple of highly curated ingredients, I can appreciate his desire to bring only the best of everything together. 
Our omakase dinner at Sushi Kimura last night came to a close with a duo of desserts by Chef Akane Eno that\'s achingly exquisite, both to the eyes and the tastebuds.\n<br />On the left: A glass of hojicha pudding that startled and seduced with a sensuous velvety creaminess heaving with the deep fragrance of charcoal-roasted green tea. Gracing it was one half of a pretty Monaka (traditional Japanese wafer) of the most delicate crispness.\n<br />On the right: The other half of the Monaka cradled a smooth, thick paste of the premium Dainagon azuki (red bean) from Hokkaido upon which slices of the madly sweet Amaou strawberry pouted.\n<br />I think I speak for our group when I say our minds were collectively blown with the first bite.
Tamago in two ways.\n<br />On the left is the Kyoto style which comprises of only egg and dashi.\n<br />On the right is the Tokyo style that has shrimp and yam combined with the egg. \n<br />Both, mouthfuls of bliss.
I never knew an abalone had a liver, let alone one that is considered a delicacy. Also, the livers of male and female abalones differ with the latter being darker in appearance. Yes, dinner at Sushi Kimura can be an educational experience, on top of being delicious. This seasonal item was served grilled, along with the abalone which had been simmered in sake for 8 hours; a pairing that left a deep impression on all of us.
This beautiful platter was one of the courses served midway through our omakase dinner.\n<br />It consisted of (from left to right): katsuo (skipjack tuna) in egg yolk sauce, hotaru Ika (firefly squid), orange clam and botan ebi.\n<br />From the plant family, we had the pleasure of a wasabi leaf, lotus stem, water eggplant and an ice plant. \n<br />Each element, whether harvested from sea or land, was pure delight.
Sawara (Japanese Spanish Mackerel) and Hotaru Ika (Firefly Squid)
Chef Tomoo is probably one of the friendliest sushi chefs around. Always jovial and willing to share his knowledge on sushi. He\'s also very generous, just look at the amount of uni he has piled on! . . . .
So melt in your mouth good. Oishii

c\'mon body! fight fight fight!
My friend loved it too! Arigatou gozaimasu!
It is so under appreciated. Sushi Kimura serves a Komagura set where you can try 3 types of Komagura from the Fukuoka prefecture (60ml each) for $35. This is a really good way to try them without buying a whole bottle.\n<br />*\n<br />The first one was an organic sake made from Yamada Nishiki rice. It was my favourite for the night. Slightly sweet but so clear and pure.\n<br />*\n<br />The second was a Komagura Shin Enjuku-Junmai Daiginjo. This was a very elegant and clean tasting junmai daiginjo but it didn\'t stand out when compared to the first one we had.\n<br />*\n<br />The third one (Gen) stood out as more mature and complex. It was aged for 5 years. It was a perfect progression from the very fresh and light organic sake. Loved this too üòç!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimurasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
His is still the best so far üòçüòç. What makes it so so good? The toro (fatty tuna) was nice and fatty. More importantly the nori (seaweed) was very crispy giving the bite a good crunch. Chef @tomoo specially sources his nori from the Saga prefecture in Japan. I wish I had space for another one üò≠!\n<br />*\n<br />Swipe for more photos\n<br />*\n<br />Fortunately there was another roll thanks to Robert üòä. We had the pleasure of sharing one of his favourite maki (roll) - ika kyu (squid and cucumber).

I was very full by then but I still managed to finish it! Her monaka with azuki (red bean) and hojicha (roasted tea) pudding served with muscat grapes was so pretty and absolutely delectable.\n<br />*\n<br />Monaka is a traditional Japanese sweet of crisp wafers with sweet filling inside. The wafers were very beautiful (sourced from Kanazawa) - almost too beautiful to be eaten.\n<br />*\n<br />This was my second time having it and I loved it even more! This is because I spread the azuki and hojicha pudding onto the wafers, pressed them together and ate it like a biscuit. Why didn\'t I eat it like that earlier? That is after all what a monaka looks like.

This is not always available so when we saw it, we were on cloud nine!\n<br />*\n<br />My shrimp was so gigantic that it could hardly fit into the bowl.

No ikura for me due to my allergies.\n<br />*\n<br />Unlike most omakase meals where the highlight is the sushi, I find myself getting even more excited after the last sushi is served. That is because I know I will be served this rice bowl which is so so yummy üòçüòç! The uni is so sweet while the onsen egg yolk gives it a nice consistency.

My favourite part of the meal.\n<br />*\n<br />From left to right:-\n<br />- Shima aji (striped jack)\n<br />- Kinmedai (golden eye snapper) belly. I didn\'t know this could taste so good üòç\n<br />- Chutoro (semi fatty tuna) from a 180kg tuna üòç\n<br />- Tako (octopus) with yuzu and uni (sea urchin) salt\n<br />- Otoro (fatty tuna) which was aged for 10 days so that the fat will melt üòçüòç\n<br />- Zuke (marinated tuna) from the same 180kg tuna\n<br />- Shoko (baby amberjack)\n<br />- Tai (seabream)\n<br />- Shiro ebi (white shrimps) with uni salt üòç\n<br />*\n<br />Similar to the sashimi, the sushi served will change with the season depending on what is available. Chef @tomosushiiii can try to source some your favourites  if they are available. I love that personal touch as you can have a combination of the usual favourites and a few new surprises.\n<br />*\n<br />If you are a small eater like me, you can ask for less rice üòä.

I love nodoguro so needless to say I enjoyed this dish very much.

All Hokkaido ingredients - crab, corn and even water. The crab and corn were naturally very sweet (which is why I love Hokkaido food so much). The sweetness seeped into the chawanmushi, making it so delicious that I was yearning for more üò≠ but I knew I had to save my appetite for more yummy dishes to come üòç.\n<br />*\n<br />I make it a point to visit Kimura every season of the year.

No ikura for me because of my allergies.\n<br />*\n<br />This is the first time I\'ve had the uni steamed. According to Chef @tomosushiiii, the uni tastes more cheesy and slight sweeter when steamed. The contrast to the yuba was larger than previous occasions when the uni was served fresh. I actually liked this version more.\n<br />*\n<br />Coming to Kimura is always an enjoyable experience. The ambience is relaxed - not at all uptight. Chef Tomoo must be one of the friendliest sushi chefs in town. His lively personality and sincerity truly set the experience apart from other sushiyas.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimurasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

I\'ve got to admit I am not a fan of shishamo and so when this was served I had my reservations. Why? They tend to be a tad fishy but one bite and I realised how silly of me. Of course, Chef Tomoo will make any fish taste delicious. Grilled to perfection, these were really good, none of that fishiness which I dislike and we all ate up the entire fish, head to tail. Oh yes, and those micro tomatoes were not only delightful to eat but were a true test of our chopstick skills.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#grilledshishamo #microtomatoes #omakase #finedining #sushikimurasg #japanesecuisine #sgfoodie #sgfood #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg

People often balk at how much Omakase meals can cost. I was one of them too. After having had the privilege of having some meals here and in the land of the rising sun, I began to appreciate why they cost quite a bit. You literally get what you pay for.  Ingredients are key and most sushi chefs go through great lengths to source for the best seasonal varieties and cuts of fish. Everything is done to perfection. How to best serve the fish, fresh, cured or marinated? Choice of rice, vinegar, seaweed, ginger. Even the water which is used to cook the rice is imported from Japan. Perhaps now you can appreciate why too?\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#omakase #sushikimurasg #finedining #japanesecuisine #fish #neta #ilovesushi #icaneatjapanesefoodeveryday #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgig #burpplesg #burpple #sg #bscc_japanesesg
Chef Tomoo is undoubtedly my fav sushi chef in Singapore. He\'s always cheerful, passionate about his food and he\'s a treasure trove of knowledge. Dining here is like dining in an old friend\'s home. I treasure and cherish all my meals here.\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#sushikimurasg #bestsushichefintown #passion #japanesecuisine #finedining #omakase #palaisrenaissance #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgig #sg #burpplesg #burpple #bscc_japanesesg
Chef @akane.eno made this wonderful creation for us. Monaka lightly toasted and filled with anko (azuki), topped with Japanese strawberries and hojicha pudding (roasted tea). Both were so oishii that I couldn\'t decide which I loved more! May I have more please?

We were served both Tokyo and Kyoto styles. On the right is the Tokyo, more familiar in Omakase sushi meals and the left, Kyoto style, often featured in kaiseki dinners. Both were yummy! #tamagoyaki #tokyostyle #kyotostyle #omakase #japanesecuisine #finedining #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg

Served with a dash of Yuzu Chilli, you are the perfect soup to warm up hearts in winter and also to end any fine Omakase meal. Chef Tomoo, thanks so much for sourcing the Botan Ebi and for this lovely, lovely soup. „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô! #botanebisoup #yuzuchilli #omakase #heartfeltthanks #finedining #japanesecuisine #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg

I was privileged to have shared this Omakase with good friends who made the entire evening fun and laughter filled. Our famous last words were we won\'t be drinking more than a bottle or two and here we are at our third bottle, this time, a Koro Daiginjo. Many thanks to @siuol28 for sharing all these wonderful sakes from his treasure trove with us!

Noduguro, black throat seaperch, another of my favourite fishes. This fish is highly fatty and hence, best eaten slightly aburi-ed. So, so oishii. It is super buttery in flavour and tender. The nodoguro is typically an autumn to winter fish so you can imagine how thrilled I was when it was served #omakase #japanesecuisine #finedining #sushi #nodoguro #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg

Otoro, aged 8 days and ever so lightly aburi-ed. This was so good, melt in your mouth good! #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #sushi #otoro #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
Look at this beauty! This is from a 200kg tuna and Chef Tomoo showed us why he had to age  our next piece for 8 days prior as the fatty parts would be too chewy if just served as is #omakase #otoro #japanesecuisine #finedining #sushi #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
I can see why. I love otoro too and this time, we had a cut nearer to the shoulder, less fatty compared to the belly itself. Chef Tomoo chose this to let us try the textural difference #otoro #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #sushi #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpplesg #burpple #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
Did you know that Isaki contains a high percentage of good fat even though the taste is light and delicate? #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #isaki #sushi #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
Omakase meals are like surprises, you never know what\'s lined up but with Chef Tomoo, I know he would line up the best of the season\'s fishes #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #sushi #shimaaji #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
I was privileged to see how Chef Tomoo was deboning them when I arrived early for our dinner. Grilled to perfection, these iwashi slices were so delicious. Sprinkled with freshly toasted sesame seeds, just perfect! #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #iwashi #grilledcourse #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sg #sgig #bscc_japanesesg
Our next bottle was Junmai Daiginjo Kongoshin (Hakkaisan). So privileged to have tried this super premium sake, thanks to @siuol28! We had this with drunken abalone (abalone stewed in sake for 8 hours, essentially a labour of love). The abalone was really delicious and I enjoyed it. What Chef Tomoo surprised us with was the grilled abalone liver! This is my first time tasting it and it was yummy. I also learnt that the male and female abalone livers look different and taste differently too! What I love so much about dining with Chef Tomoo is that he is a treasure trove of knowledge and he happily shares it with his guests. This really makes a huge difference for me in my dining experience #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
I thoroughly enjoyed our sashimi course. Oishii! #omakase #katsuo #finedining #sashimi #japanesecuisine #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg

Finally, I get to have my Botan Ebi which I have been asking Chef Tomoo for. From the left (and that\'s the order you should start your bites), we had the ice plant, Botan Ebi, lotus stem and the orange clam or Aoyagi. #omakase #sashimi #botanebi #aoyagi #iceplant #lotusstem #shisoflower #japanesecuisine #finedining #sushikimurasg #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
I love chawan mushi and I love how the ingredients added to it changes each season to highlight the season\'s best produce. The secret to good chawan mushi besides skill is the water used. Chef Tomoo uses Hokkaido water #omakase #finedining #japanesecuisine #chawanmushi #egg #appetisers #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sgig #bscc_japanesesg
Kikuhime to start our dinner. Such a privilege to have both @siuol28 and Chef Tomoo explain to us the 4 great sake breweries in Japan and how the taste of sakes evolved over time to suit modern palates. Our dinner started off with yuba (which I love)  dressed in dashi jelly and topped with ikura and uni. Yummy! #omakase #sushikimurasg #finedining #japanesecuisine #sake #kikuhime #appetisers #palaisrenaissance #Orchard #burpple #burpplesg #sgig #sg #bscc_japanesesg
It makes the whole dining experience more relaxed and fun. He is also a wealth of knowledge on anything Japanese. I learn something new each time I pay him a visit.\n<br />*\n<br />He sources all his key ingredients from Japan - even the water used for cooking! His nori (seaweed) is especially crispy and delicious. He sources it directly from Kumamoto prefecture and it is specially packaged for him.\n<br />*\n<br />I will definitely be back for the next season. Dining at Sushi Kimura is always such a great experience.\n<br />All the more so when you have great company - thanks @sk_food_and_travel @blueskiescottonclouds @veronicaphua @siuol28 - and great sake - thanks @siuol28 !\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I do not like my desserts too sweet and this was just perfect.\n<br />*\n<br />Monaka is a traditional Japanese dessert with crispy outer wafer and sweet filling. Chef @akane.eno served hers with roasted hojicha (green tea) on one wafer and azuki (sweet red bean) topped with Japanese strawberries on the other wafer.

The right hand side was the Tokyo sushi style with shrimp and yam whilst the left hand side was the Kyoto kaiseki style with dashi. Can\'t decide which one was better - I liked them both!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I have heard @blueskiescottonclouds rave about Chef Tomoo\'s botan ebi head soup for a while now but I never had a chance to taste it until that night. It was sooo good.

The literal translation is actually \'car\' prawn - apparently because it curls up (when still alive) such that it resembles a steering wheel.\n<br />*\n<br />Served slightly warm, the flesh is rich and sweet.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

I loved every piece of sushi served that night üòã. My best meal with Chef Tomoo so far.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Chef Tomoo explained that he seared it because the fat was too chewy. It would have needed another 2 days of ageing before the fat melted.\n<br />*\n<br />This cut was taken from the belly. It was only lightly seared and it melted in your mouth instantly. Oishii!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Instead of the belly which may sometimes be too oily, this was a cut near the shoulder. Not as fatty but definitely had better flavour and texture. It tasted almost like beef. Oishii!\n<br />*\n<br />This was from a 200kg blue fin tuna - typically the bigger the better. Due to increasing demand for maguro (and especially the toro), the blue fin tuna is currently overfished. According to Chef Tomoo, we don\'t see too many huge tunas at the auction these days.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Watching Chef Tomoo prepare sushi is always a delight. His sushi skills were honed by years of training in Tokyo before he made his way to Singapore. He was previously at Sushi Ichi and Hashida before striking out in his own.\n<br />*\n<br />We began with shima aji (striped jack), followed by isaki (grunt).\n<br />*\n<br />I love Chef Tomoo\'s gari (pickled ginger). It is so finely sliced and has a slight hint of sweetness. It is typically used to cleanse the palate in between sushis. However, I like his version so much that I always end up asking for a refill, only to be reminded that it is pickled in sugar - not great for the waistline!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Its flesh is dense, rich and oily with a strong flavour - a little like saba (mackerel).\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Not quite like the ankimo (monkfish liver) üòçüòç but still tasty. The darker liver on the left is from a female abalone whilst the one on the right is from a male. So interesting! I always learn so much from Chef @tomosushiiii\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
\'Drunken abalone\' as Chef @tomosushiiii calls it üòÇ\n<br />*\n<br />Seaweed sprinkled on top - from Saga prefecture. Chef Tomoo sources his own ingredients from all over Japan. You can be ensured of a truly Japanese meal when dining at Sushi Kimura!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It gives you a reason to come back every season!\n<br />*\n<br />Chef Tomoo recommended that we eat from right to left - botan ebi (botan shrimp) üòçüòç, orange clam, hotaru ika (firefly squid) and katsuo (bonito) marinated in egg yolk sauce. We do not always get botan ebi so you can imagine how thrilled we were when we saw it.\n<br />*\n<br />Even the vegetables were delicious! From right to left again, we had the ice plant üòçüòç, water eggplant, lotus stem and Japanese cucumber.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
What stands out is his nori (seaweed) which he sources from Kumamoto prefecture.\n<br />*\n<br />Mine was a low-carb version i.e. less rice üòÇ\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It definitely gives you a reason to come back!\n<br />*\n<br />We had white asparagus, bamboo shoot and ume (Japanese plum) in our chawanmushi this time around. I never thought I would like my chawanmushi with vegetables but this definitely changed my mind.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
As always, Chef Tomoo was very chatty and hospitable. We immediately felt welcomed and relaxed.\n<br />*\n<br />Our omakase began with uni (sea urchin) üòçüòç and ikura (salmon roe) with dashi jelly and yuba (beancurd skin). The strong \'umami\' flavour of the uni contrasted well with the clean and refreshing taste of the ikura, dashi jelly and yuba.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_sushikimura #sushikimura #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
