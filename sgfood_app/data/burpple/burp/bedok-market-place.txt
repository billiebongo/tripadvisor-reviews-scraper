Renovated to look like the old school olden shop houses yet emitting a hippy chill vibe with hawker centre setting. \n<br />Went round ordering food from #theburningoak - their beef short rib ($6) + Negima Chicken Thigh ($2) was simply amazing! The beef was easily the most tender I\'ve ever had - ah ma liu 👵 had absolutely no trouble at all! \n<br />At the #ballisticmeatballs, had their half portion of Quesadallia ($7.50) - brillant especially with their yoghurt \"tartar\" sauce! So Good! \n<br />I would have to say skip the Seng\'s Wanton Mee - as I found it disappointing. Their dumplings on the other hand was the saving grace! A whole prawn encased with smooth wanton wrapping, had alittle crunch from the water chestnut. I wouldnt mind having a bowl of dumpling soup!
Previously known as \"Sin Kee Chicken Rice\" at Margaret Drive!  The chicken is amazingly good, soft and tender. The rice is soft and fragrant (And you don\'t get sick of it) This place is recommended for all ages! 
The stuff of our supper dreams - Uncle Chicken a Rice presents the Lo Ding Set which consists of dry instant noodles, juicy poached chicken, vegetables, luncheon meat and ramen style egg. Really simple fare that comes together nicely, and can\'t have enough of the crackling and sauce underneath the bed of springy noodles! 
[The Bedok Marketplace] Have you visited the revamped Simpang Bedok Food Centre yet? It\'s a place that I used to frequent during my secondary school days, after midnight soccer at the nearby basketball court or to watch live soccer matches. Renamed The Bedok Marketplace, it is an old-skool/retro looking place which houses several niche and traditional stalls such as Seng\'s Wanton Noodle which is also at Dunman Road Food Centre. Definitely the traditional kind of wonton noodles ($4.50) which has eggy noodles mixed with their signature chilli sauce and homemade wantons. Char siew is kinda mediocre but you should not be hoping to get those dark, charred and shiny char siew from a wonton noodles stall. #hawkerpedia
Beginning to like the Bedok market place quite abit. Restaurant quality (at least better than what you find in chains) food at half the price. Meatballs was stuffed with beef and cheese, and served with 5 of these boys. Overall a satisfying and rather filling meal!
Value for money. Enjoyed the prawns and pork wrapped in the soft rice rolls. Makes a no-brainer side dish!
From Huong Que Vietnamese Cuisine at Bedok Marketplace. The broth tasted a tad heavy and seemed laden with MSG, though the beef was surprisingly tender and not too gamey. Rice noodles were slurpy and smooth, but let down by the overly heavy and salty broth.
From a new stall at The Bedok Marketplace named Ballistic which serves everything meatballs. Described as sesame-battered meatballs with cheese, the meatballs sadly tasted a tad too gamey; perhaps they could have used better quality beef. Meatballs also were a tad dry but the cheesiness seemed to have made up for it with stringiness. 
Back here, with a newly opened chicken rice stall (Uncle Chicken Rice, previously Sin Kee Famous Chicken Rice). $3, simple fare tender and juicy chicken. 
People usually associate Simpang as a go-to supper place and mamak stalls. However, the place recently underwent a facelift and we were fortunate to savour some of the dishes before the grand reopening. At this new revamped space, all of the stalls were new and the vendors chosen served unique dishes that were not available in the vicinity. Traditional hawker food in a new dining experience.
Indisputably our favourite dish from dinner (where we overordered as usual). Tender fleshy &amp; smokey goodness (and no bones unlike bedok 85\'s). Pretty awesome tangy, spicy sambal, full of flavour.
Reopened in dec, this hawker centre is damn hip with stalls modeled after shophouses. Pretty good place to hang out for decent food although it\'s much pricier than your average hawker fare (there\'s a cool bar with cheese platters!!). Many stalls have yet to open but currently there\'s vietnamese, frog porridge, Taiwanese porridge, western food, crab, curry rice etc.
Opposite the famous Jln Tua Kong Mee Pok

The char siew were more towards average, while the wantons fared better, being more filling and comes in both boiled and fried variants.
Revamped hawker place with many options
Hot grilled chicken on mixed greens. Healthier alternative for me 😏✌️\n<br />#chopchopselections #grilledchickensalad #bedokmarketplace #foodie #foodpath #foodporn #foodjournal #ieatishootipost #salads #foodstagram #burpple

Normally there\'s a queue at this stall but given it was a Tuesday evening, I was lucky that I didn\'t have to wait. The noodles had the right amount of \"que-ness\" and the base sauce was shiok! The chicken feet was stewed to perfection, all the cartilage and skin literally falls off the bone.. I love the soup.. full of flavour rather just just salty, peppery or full of msg like some places.. and I thoroughly enjoyed the generous portion of deep fried wantons which were served slight warm but retaining its crispiness all the way to the last piece 👍🏼 #burpple #foodiesunite #gettingfatwhilewaiting #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljns #lomljnck #newbeginnings
[V Sedap Seafood] Had wanted chicken rice but the other one has closed. Had my doubts cos this stall sort of baogaliao with zichar and chicken rice but it was surprisingly good, silky and tender but pricey. This small portion set us back by $9!
both satisfying on the tummy and on the pocket.. will be back to Try the other pastas! #burpple #whilewaiting #lomljns
mostly tender and charred edges which give it some dynamics.. the rice is normal white rice, would definitely be a bonus if its Japanese sushi rice! At $10, it\'s a very filling meal as it comes with soup and chawanmushi plus, there\'s an abundance of rice!😬\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#fisherchef#japanesefood#bedokmarketplace#chicken#teriyakichicken#chickenteriyaki#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
It\'s quite good actually as it doesn\'t feel jelak.. I think it taste better when its just serve cause the Uncle said that my plate was actually ready for collection 5mins agos.. the rice unfortunately is normal white rice but with a chawanmushi and miso soup as sides, it makes this $10 set a pretty enjoyable one.🙂\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#fisherchef#japanesefood#bedokmarketplace#chicken#chickenkaraage#chickenkaraagedon#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Tender, and well season meat with superb satay gravy.. Plus it looks more like a yakitori stick.

The frog legs are soft and chewy to the extent that one can easily consume both the meat and its bones together as you indulge in it. \n<br />#SFL #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #8dayseat #openricesg #instafood_sg #burpple #nomnomsg #sgig #hungrygowhere #foodsg #sgfoodporn #burpplesg #instasg #sgcafe #sgcafes #sgeatout #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #singaporeinsiders #igfood #foodhunter #sgfooddiary #sgcafefood #igfoodies #igsg #foodiesg #foodie
