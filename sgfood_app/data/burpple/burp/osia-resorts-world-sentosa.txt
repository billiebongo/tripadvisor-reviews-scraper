Portion was good to kick start a good Sunday morning! Relaxing by the beach too!
Quite a unique creme br√ªl√©e they got here üòä
Croissant with scrambled eggs, house chicken wings and iced lemon tea. Booking for private functions is available.
If you and your pals enjoy hitting the beach, this might just be the perfect place for a mini island gateaway! Order a few ice cold beers or cocktails to sip on, and chow down hearty beach food while lazing around on their sunbeds and deck chairs. Great for affordable brunch on the weekend, or even an after work hangout to relax with your girls.
This I enjoyed. The chopped garlic was so fragrant! #latergram
Loved my aunt and sis üòä
Can you believe this huge bowl was only half a portion of salad? #latergram
This was pretty good but I prefer the Coastes wings I ha during mr last visit. #latergram
Banoffee tart, two thumbs up! All good things come together: chocolate, caramel, banana and berries!
Visited aunt at her new work place at Sentosa and got to try delicious food with great ambience. We had the chilli crab dip, a must try together with the seafood linguine with spicy anchovy tomato sauce. The pasta comes with an option of white wine sauce but the staff strongly recommended the anchovy sauce as it is homemade. Lastly, we had the house wings which was super yummy! Will definitely come back for the food and the good atmosphere.
Awesome brunch hangout with the girlfriends on a sunny Saturday afternoon...
Situated along Siloso Beach Walk, Coastes is the place to go for a lazy sunday brunch if you would like some sun and breeze. Here\'s a photo of  Chilli Crab Meat. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/coastes-siloso-beach/

Whilst waiting for dinner and Jazz by the Beach. Undeniably a great place to hang out especially when they have live bands playing, I can\'t day much for the food. Definitely stick to drinks and enjoy the company of your friends.

However, the prawn aglio olio üçù is still a favourite!
