Usually the main concern is whether the food standard retain.. but after a hearty meal here, we are glad to say that their standard has maintained and although the rustic new look needed some getting used to, the food quality is what really mattered and as for us, a big sigh of relief as we cleared the last grain of rice on our plates..\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#bsailing#dresort#chickenwings#tomyum#thailand#greencurry#thaifood#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
this is definitely not for the faint hearted as it is \'lemak\', spicy, meaty and just plain all around delicious! Highly recommend! But caution...

It\'s savory and has crispy edges and has sort of a fluffy body. It\'s mince pork meat certainly creates a more chewy sensation and of course does adds to the taste to this already delicious egg!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#bsailinn#dresort#omelette#mincepork#thailand#khaijiao#thaifood#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
Laden with coconut milk, Thai seasoning, chili and chunky slices of pork!  The gravy is really reminiscent of something from a nasi Padang stall! Creamy, thick lemak curry!\n<br />Yum! 😋\n<br />8/10\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#basilinn#curry#thaifood#foodie#eat#delicious#makan#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#hawker#localfood#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#like4like#foodporn#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Still the best I\'ve had since forever.
So who is this WISELY? I had comfort Thai food at my favourite Thai restaurant after voting. Thai food on the table - $40. Always delicious, Nett price &amp; packed so you know they are good! 😝😋😋 #food #foodies #foodporn #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgcafes #igsg #igfood #instafood #foodstagram #foodphotography #eatoutsg #burpple #foodgasm #foodbloggers #foodpics #instasg #instafoodsg #misschocoholic #foodpic #tinlicious #openricesg #thaifood #basilinn #thebasilinn
The wait will be 30mins to an hour, even if you are the first customer. It\'s unfortunate despite its success, the restaurant has become inefficient after its expansion. If it can deal with these issues, I believe it can achieve much more. We are a fan though, and patronise it every other week. The food is worth the wait and we look forward to see it progress further!
Thai at it\'s best
Thai Basil Chicken! I am very impressed with this dish! Ever since Amoydee\'s standard drops, I thought I would not be able to find awesome basil chicken in Singapore! The Basil Chicken here is packed full of flavour and awesomely spicy! :D #sgig #igsg #instasg #instagramsg #nofilter #singapore #food #foodpics #foodporn #foodies #dinner #basil #chicken #thai
