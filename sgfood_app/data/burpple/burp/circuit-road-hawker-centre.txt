Super nice- not too oily and the only customised black &amp;white carrot cake. Auntie is very nice ! Worth the wait!

Started by Andy Tan, who wanted to create his own muah chee with more finesse, unlike those sold at pasar malam. He blends the dough and steams his muah chee in individual trays, later cutting them by hand so that the sizes are the same.\n<br />.\n<br />The \"yuan yang\" muah chee - a mix of both white and black sesame - is served in a boat-shaped dish with decorative tooth picks.\n<br />.\n<br />We love the black sesame version, it comes with dough that is infused with black sesame flavour. The glutinous rice dough is less sticky compared to local versions, and it has some bounce to it.\n<br />The sesame coating is fragrant, roasty and very fine, not too sweet, and there is a light crunch.\n<br />.\n<br />Glad that Andy is retaining his Singaporean roots to carry on the tradition of making muah chee. 😊\n<br />_______________\n<br />Heavenly Snacks 天下小吃\n<br />Blk 79A, Circuit Road \n<br />#01-106\n<br />Singapore 371079\n<br />.\n<br />#ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #dojoeats
The jumbo oysters were fresh and plump, and the Uncle wasn\'t stingy on the servings😋However the eggs portion was slightly bland, flour a tad clumpy. This orh luak may not be the best we’ve tasted (we don\'t need the best all the time) but this dish has been passed down from the hawker’s grandfather with a recipe unchanged for generations. Truly admire older hawkers for their dedication to tradition despite the thirst for diverse flavours and new trends. Simple, unchanged tastes bring bouts of happiness and that\'s what matters.\n<br />.\n<br />Slightly on the saltier side, the chili packs a punch and left us wanting more. A good offering for a quaint neighbourhood at MacPherson.\n<br />_______________\n<br />Ghim Huan Fried Oyster\n<br />Blk 79A, Circuit Road \n<br />#01-16\n<br />Singapore 371079\n<br />.\n<br />#ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #dojoeats

They are so yummy and fresh!
The siew mai here is also less sticky and tasted more homely. Both items are handmade in the stall, ensuring freshness.
The spinach was aplenty and comes with slices of carrots, while the mock char siew given was little and thinly sliced.

Though it lacked crisp, the carrot cake was soft and easy to chew!
It comes fried with small tomatoes, mock fishcakes and egg that made the noodles rather filling in overall.
It comes with crispy fries, toasted bread and coleslaw that tasted quite normal.
I\'m confused. Why it sort of tasted like half-cooked bak kwa? The satays were too sweet and not bbq-ed/smoked well enough. 😦
