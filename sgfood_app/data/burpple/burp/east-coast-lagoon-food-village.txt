Part of this year\'s Singapore Food Festival is Hawker Spotlight which celebrates our hawker heritage by highlighting select hawker centres each year. This year, it\'s East Coast Lagoon Food Village! Brings back memories of lunching here after a morning cycle with the family. We were given a short tour and introduction by Mr Moses Lim himself to five local favourites, which included curry fish head, char kway teow and satay. Out of the selected stalls, the best had to be the fish head curry as pictured above (Eastern Red Seafood, # 01-37). The curry was spicy and very flavourful, while the fish was fresh and flaky.\n<br />.\n<br />Many thanks to Visit Singapore and City Gas for hosting, and Burpple for the invite!
The price was reasonable I guess for this amount of good food served on the table! Any seafood lovers out there, I recommend coming here. 7.5/10 :)
Delish comfort must-have food whenever a beach visit occurred! From left to right: Scrumptious Chicken Satay! Prawn Hokkien Mee! Fried Oyster Egg! 
Oyster omelette is one of my favorite Singapore hawker food and I especially love this one from east coast. There are many stalls there but I always buy from stall that is on the side very near the car park. And they only sell oyster omelette so you know they must be good! 
If you notice something missing in my pic, it is because I asked the hawker to leave off the topping of ground peanuts. Personally, I prefer this dish not to be overwhelmed by it. Named \"Set B\", a quartered century egg topped with pickled ginger slices accompanies the \"rojak\". I find the quality of the latter to be pretty consistent and more than decent, but the taste does fall on the sweet side. Which is why I think the pungent century egg with its creamy-savoury yolk combines well with it. \n<br />If preserved eggs aren\'t your thing, they also have BBQ dried cuttlefish, \"tau pok\" and \"you tiao\". \n
Really nice seafood @ hawker centre of east cost park. The price is really fair. 
There are several satay stalls at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village so I tend to randomly pick one to order from whenever I\'m there. Based on the few I\'ve tried, the overall standard of the satay seems pretty good to me. This batch of chicken satay came from \"Oleh Oleh Bandung\" a corner stall furthest inland, away from the beach. The evenly-grilled meat was succulent, tender and the peanut sauce was an appetising mix of sweet and spicy.
Strangely, I have never had a craving for fried Hokkien prawn mee when I visit this hawker centre. Too many distractions in the form of \"orh luak\", \"wantan mee\", BBQ sambal stingray, satay etc. I guess. This time however, was a different story. And I have to give myself a pat on the back for finally ordering \"Yi Ji Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles\" (stall 47) because it turned out to be stupendous.\n<br />Cooked in a wet style, the hawker used a fragrant stock that\'s rich with fresh pork and prawn flavour. He also skillfully kept the yellow \"mee\" and thin \"beehoon\" slightly firm to the bite, which I much prefer to a messy mush. The highlight for me though was the kickass chilli sambal belachan. A little of it went a long way as it\'s real fiery but boy, was it addictive!\n
SGD 4 - Had this from Meera Mee Stall ( Bedok Corner ), and takeaway chicken and beef satays from Musa Ikan Bakar and chicken wings from one of the stalls. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal! 
Prices are at $4/$5/$6 for a plate here. Shun Fa Satay Bee Hoon has opened up a 2nd branch at East Coast Village Food Centre, at the spot of Meng Kee Satay Bee Hoon (which had an inevitable closure). The sauce here tasted less peanuty, while the beehoon remains moist and absorbing part of the flavour of the sauce! Ingredients are plenty here, and there will still be a lot of sauce left after you finish the beehoon!
Prices are at $4/$5/$6 a plate. Besides from seafood and satay, East Coast Lagoon Food Village is also famous for this Wanton Mee ($4) that has chewy noodles, small but tasty char siew that comes with its own sauce and fried wantons!
$5, pretty generous with the cuttlefish, prawn and meat + cockles that I don\'t eat. Ingredients were quite fresh. Thick peanut gravy doesn\'t seem as nice as the past, a little bland, but still, I hardly ever get to eat this so it was pretty decent to me. Does anyone know anywhere with good satay beehoon?!!!!!!
Satay bee hoon, Satay, Roxy laksa, BBQ stingray. Suck all the food up. ($15-20)
Our favourite stall, \"Teddy Bear BBQ Chicken Wings\" was closed when we were there on a Wednesday night, so we ended up ordering from Chong Pang Huat (#01-18) instead. Their chicken wings looked good but failed the taste test. There wasn\'t much flavour in the meat to begin with and we detected a strange stale smell (perhaps they were frozen for too long?). I doubt we will be ordering from them again.
Sometimes when a legendary hawker closes, the new tenant that takes over the stall unit tries to piggy-back on the former\'s fame by selling the same food. This is what\'s happening at unit #01-17 at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. It use to be home to my favourite \"Meng Kee Satay Beehoon\" but sadly, the owners had to close for good in 2012 due to ill health.\n<br />The latest hawker to take over the space beginning early January 2015 is actually not a newbie. It is in fact, the recently launched official branch of the well-known \"Shun Fa Satay Beehoon\" at ABC Brickworks hawker centre. The son of the original stall\'s owner runs this place.\n<br />Honestly, I had high hopes for it but ended up feeling a little let down. Their satay gravy wasn\'t as well balanced IMHO - my tastebuds found the five-spice powder a bit too strong. The few cockles in my $5 portion were miserably small and the slices of pork weren\'t cut properly either. That resulted in some clumping during cooking which made it hard to eat. There were a couple of good points though: the blanched vegetables were crunchy and the ingredients, relatively generous. Service by the gentleman taking the orders was also good.\n<br />Of course everyone has different tastes. Hence I\'m sure although I am not a fan, there are, and will be others who\'ll enjoy \"Shun Fa Satay Beehoon\". The best thing is to try it for yourself.\n
Stall 45 at the popular East Coast Lagoon food centre is probably the only \"wanton mee\" stall in Singapore where I\'d admit I am there because of the \"char siew\".\n<br />Having always rooted for savoury over sweet, \"char siew\" has never held that much fascination for me. So when I tuck into \"wanton mee\", it is the combination of everything else that matters more. Not just those few slices of red-coloured meat. This stall however, is one of the rare exceptions.\n<br />What I like about their version is that the texture of the \"char siew\" is just right: not hard, dry or chewy. Plus the unique way it\'s cut adds to the enjoyment because the meat sort of comes apart more easily. Being completely infiltrated by the sweet marinade during preparation stage and then served with extra sauce over it, flavour and juiciness are aplenty too. The meat has also spent enough time over flames to be charred in all the right places. I swear I can taste a slight smokiness in every delectable bite.
When at the east\'s most iconic and bustling dinner spot, be sure to try out their oyster omelette ($4), duck rice ($3.50) (!!!raves), wonton mee ($3) and beef noodle soup. I mean, apart from your usual very local fare of stingray and barbecued stuff. Hehe. The duck rice is of course my favourite, with succulent tasty meat atop plump, fragrant rice grains. Shiok.  
Where\'s the tastiest ones you have eaten before?\n<br />Tag your photos to #FoodReviewsSG &amp; #FoodReviewsAsia
I believe the \"chok\" or porridge at stall 39 is so darn tasty because of the many elements that get thrown in during and after the cooking process. From what I can see and taste, there\'s sesame oil, soya sauce, very finely julienned fresh ginger, pickled radish, slices of fried dough sticks and Chinese parsley. Also, the uncle keeps a huge pot of porridge simmering away on the side. He scoops from here to cook the individual orders as they come in. That probably explains why the porridge is very fine and smooth, with a slightly \"jwee jwee\" or watery consistency (I prefer this to the thick mud-like type).
There are almost as many \"orh luak\" or fried oyster stalls at this food centre as there are oysters in the sea nearby. Ok, that may be a bit of an exaggeration :) Nevertheless, it doesn\'t matter how many of them there are, because for me, it has to be Song Kee. Theirs is perfectly fried every single time with just the right balance of egg, starch and oysters. It goes without saying they also happen to have the perfect vinegary chilli sauce. 
Comfort food....
For the indecisive like me!
The noodles tasted unique, almost like mee rebus. It\'s the only duck noodles stall there.
Song Ji oyster fried egg is really good. The oysters are huge and juicy.
Feast it out at East Coast Lagoon Food Village!! Nothing can go wrong with everything you see here. Lol Bon ap petit!  
One coconut on my own because I can. Soft slippery flesh!
I remember my parents bringing us when we were young to east coast park for this slurpingly-good beef kway teow! the soup and the chili is oooh-la-la! especially after some exercise at the beach!
Our usual favourites: satay and chicken wing. And we had an additional order of white carrot cake after this 😄 ( I wasn\'t the hungry one 😜) #burpple #burpplesg #burpplesghawkerfare #eastcoastlagoon
Here, the oysters are not the biggest but what makes this plate stand out is the way the eggs taste. They are definitely the most tasty eggs I ever tasted in a orh luak dish and the eggs to corn starch ratio is nearly 10:2! Haha! Yup, the corn starch/flour at most orh luak can get out of hand and that’s why I think this cook never allow it to happen but instead focus on the crispy/fluffy texture and the savory taste of the eggs!👍🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#songkeefriedoyster#songkeeorhluak#omelette#orhluak#oyster#oysteromelette#foodie#eatsg#delicious#mee#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#eastcoastlagoonfoodvillage#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
It remains to be consistent after all these years and its signature savoury gravy, non gamey duck meat together with its awesome chili help create its legion of followers that didn’t mind queuing 20-30mins for a plate!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#cheokkee#cheokkeeduckrice#bonelessduck#eastcoastlagoonfoodvillage #duckrice#duck#foodie#eatsg#delicious#braiseduck#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#unplating#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#eastcoastlagoonfoodcentre#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

This dish usually taste generic and familiar but to its credit, it rarely taste bad. It\'s kinda like a free size T-shirt! Goes well with any dishes! Anyway since my dad don\'t take prawns, we opted for the prawnless version which in return, we get to have more beancurd!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#16bbqseafood#bbq#seafoodbeancurd#seafood#beancurd#taofu#foodie#eatsg#delicious#mee#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#eastcoastlagoonfoodvillage#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
It has the 60/40 spicy to sweet ratio with nice seasoning.

The soup was light and refreshing to have, though the kway teow was unable to soak up its flavour.
Not as good as others I tried before.\n<br />Price: $3 
Too soupy and too sweet, not my liking.\n<br />Price: $3
the wanton noodle is always a must to have. Que que noodles tossed in a sweet salty sauce and lotsa homemade chilli.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />Some parts of the charsiew was not totally charred. It was a tad sweet. However with every strand of the noodles coated with the sweet salty and spicy sauce, it was elevated to a more vibrant and superbly delish plate of wanton mee.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />One of my favorite wanton mee and has been for many years. This will be \"msginginly\" \'s 4.5 out of 5 drooling slurps.
$62 per KG. \n<br />So much meat in this. *finger-licking good*\n<br />Enjoy your Sunday night y\'all!\n<br />🦀🦀🦀\n<br />#chillicrab #칠리크랩 #eastcoast #familydayout

I am glad that I did so as the plate of fried hokkien mee turned out to be even better than the fried kway teow. The sweet and flavourful stock was well infused into the noodles. The fact that the stall uses more beehoon, it helps to absorb the beautiful stock even more.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #uncagestreetfood #tigerbeer #hokkienmee
After taking a bite of the fried kway teow, the aroma of the wok hei hit me and I instantly gone for more. The version is neither too dry nor wet, the texture that I enjoy. The sauce was also not overly sweet, coating the noodles evenly and accompanied with generous ingredients such as cockles, fish cake, Chinese sausage, bean sprouts and egg.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #uncagestreetfood #tigerbeer #ckt #charkwayteow #friedkwayteow

Ever since then, it has been a mainstay in this hawker centre and many has favoured the char kway teow. Not the top choice in my books, but a decent one if you around the area.\n<br />.\n<br />春香炒虾面。酿豆腐\n<br />Address: 1220, East Coast Parkway, East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Unit 01-46, Singapore 468960 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #hawkerhopping #singaporefoodfestival #sff2016 #hawkerspotlight #citygas #eastcoast #lagoonfoodvillage #noodles #charkwayteow

They take pride in serving you really big and fresh prawns, and great seafood. Served in their signature Mama sauce, cheesy sauce or vindaloo sauce.

It comes with a lot of oysters for its pricing that were not only big, but also juicy!
it was the perfect weather, after a whole night of thunderstorm. the air was crisp and cool and there was absolutely no sun until I was already done and downing a large jug of sugarcane juice 😄 and now to wait for the Chinese Sinseh to wake up so I can go heal my foot 😞
SGD8 worth of 蚝蛋 Oyster Omelette. this is not your usual 蚝煎 where there\'s starch (usually lots of it) and less eggs. this is pure eggy goodness with some essence of the oyster and the best part is that it was ALL MINE 🍳 ahhhhh happy food makes for a happy tummy! *rubs belly in glee* \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporefood #singaporeeats #hawkerfood #hawkerfare #eatlocal #jiaklocal @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #oysteromelette #omelette #eggs
A favourite local hawker fare which eggs, oysters and the signature gooey starch are fried to a delightful crisp.
Juicy Satay makes me happy. 😁
Here\'s Haron Satay, my favorite one there after Teddy Satay closed down. Expect thick chunks of honey-glazed meat with peanut satay sauce. Need I say more? 👅
I would rather choose to succumb
usual ingredients include Bangkuang (Turnip), Sweet Sauce, Bean Sprouts and Lettuce, to name a few, and they are then wrapped in a paper-thin popiah skin. this may not look like much but it certainly packed a punch with the softness of its skin yet crunchiness of the turnip and when top it off with potent chilli sauce....yummmmmehh! feeling so healthy just eating this 😆
