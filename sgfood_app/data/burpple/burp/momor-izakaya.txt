Molten yolk with lots of ikura in a ponzu dressing. It\'s refreshing due to the cold and light consistency, and it\'s also appetite inducing due to the heavy zest here -perfect appetizer.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />I had high expectations with my first bowl so I was slightly underwhelmed. But I\'ve had this twice and it grew on me, and this is now my go-to starter here. I can do a few more bowls of this!
The best deal in Tanglin at @momorizakaya where you get to enjoy 10 different alcohol at the price of only $5.\n<br />.\n<br />At the same time, try out their awesome Hokkaido scallops with Ikura while enjoying the alcohol.\n<br />.\n<br />Location: 56 Tanglin Road, #B1-01, Tanglin Post Office, Singapore 247964\n<br />.\n<br />#momor #burpple #burpplesg #hokkiadoscallops #scallops
It\'s available daily from 5pm to 7pm!\n<br />.\n<br />You should try this Onsen Tamago to accompany with the alcohol. I just swallow this at one shot and it\'s so shiok!\n<br />.\n<br />Location: 56 Tanglin Road, #B1-01, Tanglin Post Office, Singapore 247964\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg
My usual lunch spot, super affordable price for delicious food! The only thing is they keep changing menu every two weeks, so just be ready your favourite dish will disappear now and then, and you\'ll need to find a new favourite!
Mo\'mor French Toast with azuki beans paired with matcha ice cream. The corn flakes and berries added the extra crunch.\n<br />.\n<br />Brunch menu is available on weekends and public holidays 10am-3pm (last order at 2.30pm). You know where you can go this public holiday on Wed.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @momorizakaya, @brandcellar and @dianaaatan for the extending the invite!
Free 1 Prosecco for all ladies. Time to chill. üòè #burpple #sgdeals #instafoodsg
Waffles aren\'t the usual crisp and fluffy ones I favour; instead, a chewy, moist, and still airy batter, that holds up amidst all the sauces. The house-mixed peanut butter ice cream was fab too, and I really like how generous they were with the berries. Super worth the calories.
Two poached organic eggs, jamon Serrano, hollandaise, spinach, and a chewy toasted mentaiko muffin. Serrano ham was fantastic, wilted spinach was perf and a really generous portion too, eggs and hollandaise were flawless. It may sound quite fancy, but is really just quality ingredients in a dish that\'s ultimately unpretentious.
That\'s because when the ingredients are fresh, you rarely need to do anything too fancy. If not you\'ll risk ruining the taste of those ingredients.
Located opposite Tanglin Mall, this new Japanese-European izakaya dishes out tasty tapas and grills. The vibe is casual yet classy, with both indoor and alfresco seating ‚Äî perfect for both group gatherings and quiet one-on-ones. Some favourites from the Burpple Community include the Black Angus Grain Fed Rib Eye ($38), Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab ($14) and Charcoal Grilled Hokkaido Scallop ($24). Mo\'mor also offers a most value-for-money set lunch (available even on weekends)! $15 gets you a main and a tapas or dessert; $18 gets you one of each course. Choices for mains include Saikyo miso ginger free range spring chicken and yakiniku pork collar udon.\n<br />Avg Price: $40 per person (under $20 for lunch sets)
Favourite was the Hokkaido scallop tartare served with lotus chips. üòã The scallops were so fresh!üëåüèª I like the presentation of the food as well. Gorgeous and makes eating so much easier too!‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª
‚ò∫Ô∏èüòã This is part of 3-course lunch deal @momorizakaya! For $18++ only, you\'ll get to choose 1 tapas, 1 main, 1 dessert! Super worth the price! üòãüëçüèª .\n<br />Ps: it\'s available all day, including weekends!üòâ
This was a lavender sponge like cake served with a slice of caramelized pineapple and coconut ice cream.
I love the buzzy vibe of an izakaya and you\'ll definitely get that at Mo\'mor Izakaya! And when you throw in some awesome dishes like this super-meaty Spiced Lamb Rack ($38), Miso Ginger Chicken ($22), Iberico Pork Jowl ($12) - all at reasonable prices especially for the quantity you\'re getting, what more can one ask for? Champagne, perhaps? Why, yes! Bubbly available for only $65 a bottle for you to enjoy those yummy citrusy oysters ($5.50/pc) with! 
This pretty yuzu sabayon and oba leaf ice cream with raspberry bits and crumble ($14) is a mouthful of joy! Just one of many delicious dishes I had at Mo\'mor Izakaya. Full review at  http://thedivaeatsprata.com/momor-izakaya/
A contemporary Izakaya located at Tanglin Post Office (Opposite Tanglin Mall), this jap-european is known for its tapas and grills.\n<br />My 5 favourites:\n<br />1) Black Angus Ribeye\n<br />2) Cod Fish\n<br />3) Botan Ebi (tapas)\n<br />4) Soft shell crab (tapas)\n<br />5) Hasselback Potato (sides)\n<br />Other tapas to-try: Hokkaido scallop, Oysters &amp; Swordfish belly.\n<br />‚Äî‚Äî\n<br />Thanks @momorizakaya and #brandcellarsg for the warm invite.
The ‚Äòjumbo‚Äô here should refer to the size of the plate, but the chunks of sweet crab meat, and you get a bite of those every spoonful. \n<br />A friend has told me the owners are seafood importers, and thus has access to some of the best seafood around. \n<br />The pasta which was made by a local supplier, was cooked al dente, with just-enough seasoning, allowing the crab to be the star of this dish.
Maintaining its lovely space and service staff, Mo\'mor has gotten itself a brand new menu and much lower prices. Set lunch (2/3 course) used to be a SGD 28/35++ affair, but is now served at a very pocket friendly SGD 15/18++. And free wifi is provided. \n<br />I had the 3 course lunch with 1 tapas + 1 main + 1 sweet. Portions are on the small side, but their quality, taste and presentation remains excellent.
What\'s better than Ribeye with a glass of red wine?
Mo\'mor Izakaya is newly opened at Tanglin, for some European meets Japanese cuisine. \n<br />Helmed by local veteran Chef Martin Woo. \n<br />Signature dishes includes Charcoal Grilled Whole Japanese Squid, Australian Wagyu on Skewer, Apple Cured Salmon Sashimi, Hokkaido Scallop Tartare, Plum Tomato Ceviche, Pan Roasted Chilean Seabass, Slow Cook Charcoal Grilled Iberico Pork Collar and Matsusaka Wagyu Striploin.
The yuzu sabayon really tasted like nature - the oba leaf ice cream (turns out oba leaf is shiso leaf!!) really tastes like grass LOL but it went really well with the yuzu cream, raspberry bits and biscuit \"soil\" when you eat it together. Interesting dish because the ice cream is homemade! I\'ve actually never come across oba leaf ice cream too. The buttermilk waffles were a bit dense though - think they\'re still improving the recipe! It usually comes with peanut butter ice cream but today we had kahlua ice cream which was super yummy! Actually their ice creams made in house are really good so it\'s a bit of a pity that they don\'t come in individual scoops - hopefully they do soon!! Would totes go for that if I\'m too full from the mains in the future haha #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #momorizakaya #izakaya #tanglinpostoffice #fusion #obaleaf #dessert #buttermilkwaffle #yuzusabayon #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn
Onsen egg and mentaiko sauce with jamon ham is SUCH a good combination?! And pls look at that runny egg. Eggs Benedict isn\'t usually something I would go for because there\'s nothing very spectacular about it and some places don\'t do the hollandaise sauce very well. But omg this combination... 11/10 will come back again for this. Perfect brunch food and I\'m not one who thinks about brunch food. The croissant with scrambled eggs and smoked salmon was alright - croissant looks so pretty haha. The linguine tho came with a lot of crabmeat!! My kind of pasta dish though there was something lacking I\'m not sure what. But good on it\'s own! #burpple #burpplesg #greedtakesoversg #momorizakaya #tanglinpostoffice #eggsbenedict #brunch #brunchfood #crabmeatlinguine #fusion #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn

Alittle sweet. Alittle torched. Alittle crumbly crunch. Alittle tangy. So this is a little marshmallow. But alittle can be alot.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Dessert is alittle small on a big plate. Well.. this was not the original plate. The other plate was light grey and I figured my little dessert would speak big volume on classic black. So the chef was kind enough to re-plate and I did alittle food styling. My styling is on the right with 2 blueberries, a green sprig &amp; teeny sprinkling of crumbles. Yes, I am playing with my food again! It is just amazing how the color of the plate make the food \"be in your face\". ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Back to my marshmallow. It had a soft texture. Sweet but balanced off with the slight sourish raspberry compote. A somewhat little delight!! Thank you Chef @momorizakaya for replating at my request. \n<br />#dessertlovers #desserts #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #stfoodtrending #openricesg #igsg #igfollowers #igfoodies #instafoodsg #instafollow #sgfollowers #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #nomnom #delish #momorizakaya #chopesg
Two stops done. \"Fuelling up\" before continuing the craziness. A quick early lunch.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />Slow cooked chicken and grilled after which attempts to seduce you with the golden charred facade. If only you could smell the aromatics from my shot, it will bound to send you to a high. Sweet, salty, tender and moist with a bit of a wokheish finish. If only there was a little more of the red wine jus for the extra moisture.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />I consider this a very light lunch as the chicken pieces were small but this is however reasonably priced. \n<br />#setlunch #lunch #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #chopesg #stfoodtrending #openricesg #sgig #sgfollowers #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #eatbooksg #momorizakaya #cafesg
‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Loved the veges and the potatoes but I preferred my beef to be slightly more cooked. Too little sauce. I had high hopes. Unfortunately a tad disappointed.

We\'ve got @MomorIzakaya\'s newest brunch menu covered in a new blogpost! // You\'ll be dreaming about the¬†{Slow Cooked Poached Egg and Jamon Serrano Ham}($23.90) for many moons to come. It\'s belongs in the distinguished classes of the usual Eggs Benedict, the twist being the Jamon serrano ham and the showy display of wobbly eggs - slow coked at 61.9 degrees celsius for exactly 1 hour. Beneath the translucent slivers of cured ham and sauteed spinach lies a blanket of mentaiko butter bestowed over sweet muffin caps which elevates the experience with a punch of umami
{Cornflake Crusted French Toast} with Azuki bean and Matcha ice cream or freshly toasted waffles with peanut butter ice cream

Get it tight
I am still dreaming about yesterday\'s brunch!
Elvis would be pleased
Intensely flavourful! And it\'s accompanied by rich scramble eggs on fluffy croissant.
Waking up to memories of the {Scrambled Egg and home-smoked salmon} and {Eggs Benedict with Jam√≥n ham on mentaiko Muffin} duo at @MomorIzakaya that filled me up so nicely yesterday
A simple egg that is transformed into a culinary delight. üç≥üç≥\n<br />Having said that, it is not that easy to poach or sous vide a perfect onsen egg. Takes skill and lotsa practice to cook it stilll remaining soft, eggwhite cooked just right and the most important ... eggyolk must be golden yellow, not raw or overdone and have to be runny &amp; flowy. I am not an \"eggspert\", but I will be terribly disappointed if my onsen egg is none of the above. \n<br />#eggs #lunch #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #burpplesg #stfoodtrending #igers #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #narratrs #singaporeinsiders #momorizakaya
Yummy but a bit oily. Lobster is fresh!
It was small. It was cute. It was not sweet. The thick brown syrup surrounding it provided the so needed sweetness. Crowned with a strawberry for added acidity.
Simplicity at its best.
Sous vided perfect onsen tamagoüç≥ So orangey and bright like the very early sun. Topped with tiny roe &amp; spring onions. This does not require any salt, pepper or thick black sauce (kopi tiam style). The egg yolk is slightly bigger and had a more vibrant orange color which got me to wonder cos those we used to buy are smaller and more yellowish. Curiousity kills the cat...so i probed. This egg is local organic. Fresh smooth and totally slides down the throat. So very yummy!!\n<br />A new set lunch just launched. $15++ for 2 course and $18++ for 3 course. \n<br />Thank you my handmodel @aylenevaldez and for the wonderful service.\n<br />#lunch #i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #hungrygowhere #burpplesg #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instameetsg #instafoodsg #instafollow #singaporeinsiders #sgig #narratrs #townske_official #discoversg #momorizakaya

The clean taste of the sword fish is further elevated by the accompanying ponzu sauce, grape fruit and garlic chips.
The creaminess of the oyster and the zest from the citrus jelly worked harmoniously for a well balanced goodness.
Unfortunately the scallop did not have that grilled aroma or sweetness, with the ikura sort of throw the balance off.

The beef itself was cooked to beautiful pink sealing the lovely flavour in it. Unfortunately the beef itself was a bit tough to chew on.
The dish cries for more sauces. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #izakaya #chicken #tapas #momorizakaya
Served in a bottle, the melon gazpacho is poured onto the plate to be enjoyed together with the raspberry sorbet and berries salsa.
Sword Fish Belly ($15). The clean taste of the sword fish is further elevated by the accompanying ponzu sauce, grape fruit and garlic chips.

The flavours were mellow and bright notes from the ginger. The char grilling to finish up the dish gave it a nice hint of smokiness.
