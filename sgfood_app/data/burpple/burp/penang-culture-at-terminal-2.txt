7/10👌🏽
This deluxe version is further boosted with a slipper lobster and shell on scallop to crown the whole bowl of deliciousness with a crustacean glory :)\n<br />#penangculturesg #penangculture #penangprawnmee #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #slipperlobster
Penang Culture has joined in the salted egg craze ,hence this salted egg dish! Tender flat noodles wok fried with garlic, beansprouts , homemade sambal and mashed salted egg. The kway teow has a distinct taste of wok hei which made the entire dish a tasty one. Topped with generous amount of prawns, squid, fish cake , cockles and finish off with meaty mud crab meat and salted egg crumbs, I am completely in love with this dish!\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @penangculture and @alexsondranicole for inviting! ☝️😋\n<br />.\n<br />Find more info in my blog!\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #wheretoeatsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #onthetable #penangculture
