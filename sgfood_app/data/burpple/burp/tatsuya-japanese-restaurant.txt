Ordered their sashimi platter. Comes with different types, (Salmon, tuna, cuttlefish, sweet prawn etc) ! This restaurant located at Goodwoodpark Hotel is definitely a hidden gem (an expensive one too) hehe. The platter costed me a good SGD120++ and mind you, It\'s just the smallest one. 👊
Definitely one of my fave places for good jap food. Pretty reasonably priced as well if you go for their weekday set lunches. 
Tatsuya has been around for eternity, and they are renowned for serving excellent sushi. It is evident that the sashimi is super fresh, with the delicate, well-cut slices of sashimi simply melting in your mouth. They do omakase stunningly well, but that comes with a pretty hefty price tag. If you\'d still like to enjoy sushi without breaking the bank, go for their bento sets. Your stomach and wallet will thank you.
I\'m back here again, but this time round just trying their lunch set at $38. A very satisfied Monday lunch indeed. 
What does Tatsuya mean? “Tat” is one of the names Chef-proprietor Ronnie Chia is known by, and Tatsuya means House of Tat. One of the joys of eating at the House of Tat is the fact that you get to eat produce that you might only get to eat when you visit Japan. Just be prepared to pay for the pleasure (S$280++/pax). Go for Tatsuya’s famous aburi (roasted) sushi.
The holy grail of all chirashi don. This is the bomb. I die a happy girl. 
Amazingly delicious and fresh. Price is $$$ - $$$$. But its all worth it. 
The best Japanese Restaurant in Singapore. Try the affordable and pretty bento sets available only during lunch 😄😄 || Visit us at www.thumbsforfood.blogspot.com to read on!
If you are looking for the perfect exquisite Japanese Bento box, this is it. 
When you are in the mood to spoil yourself, this is a good choice. Surrender yourself to the capable hands of the chef and let his creative concoctions, both raw and cooked, delight you.
Incredible options for fellow vegans and vegetarians. This avocado roll had tempura inside and a delicious sesame sauce on top. Another great roll was the spinach roll with tempura on top and more sesame sauce. I got their vegetable fried rice without egg, incredible. Some of my none vegan friends got seared salmon which seemed amazing. A bit more on the pricey side with avocado roll being around $20
