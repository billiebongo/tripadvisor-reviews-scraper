The Salted Egg Croissant ($6.90) has light and fluffly pastry, with a buttery taste to it. On the other hand, the salted egg custard was a tad too stingy on their end. Although a drip of custard did flow out, that was all it had for my whole croissant. Nonetheless, their service impressed me as they offer to reserve a croissant for me when I enquired about it over Facebook. Many thanks to Mr Rizal who reserved it! @dapaologroup \n<br />#ailove2eat #goodfood #loveforfood #instafood #foodporn #fooddiary #foodlover #맛있어요 #おいしい #sgfood #singapore #singaporefood #instaworthy #igfood #igphoto #instaphoto #foodstagram #sgig #instasg #foodie #food #saltedegg #croissant #saltedeggcroissant #gastronomia #dapaologroup #hollandvillage
Starting the day with an awesome cup of Mint Mocha ($6.50). The mint wasn\'t too strong and blends well with my caffeinated chocolatey drink. It almost tasted like the mint Andes chocolate. Great place, awesome food, and wonderful service from @dapaologroup.\n<br />And so, my journey through the Salted Egg Croissant war begins here. \n<br />#ailove2eat #goodfood #loveforfood #instafood #foodporn #fooddiary #foodlover #맛있어요 #おいしい #sgfood #singapore #singaporefood #instaworthy #igfood #igphoto #instaphoto #foodstagram #sgig #instasg #foodie #food #singapore #morning #gastronomia #dapaologroup #mocha #coffee #mint #saltedeggcroissant #saltedegg #croissant
