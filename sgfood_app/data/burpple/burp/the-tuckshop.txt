More details on the dishes at later posts. \n<br />Saw this drink Kaya Butter Kopi on their menu and found it pretty interesting. It had a kaya butter aftertaste which was not too overpowering. It was like dipping your kaya butter toast into a cup of kopi. üëçüèª
My favourite at The Tuckshop, and also the most underrated of all brunch dishes, is this lovely serving of Fresh Local Waffles (S$12++). The waffles are freshly made to order, served with kaya butter (yes you didn\'t read that wrong), green tea gelato, and a drizzle of condensed milk. It\'s simple, yet really delicious. While their most raved about dishes are the super instagrammable savoury mains, make no mistake that this is no less worth a try.
To celebrate a well-deserved Saturday why not head down to The Tuckshop for some premium brunch items?! The hearty platter consist of wagyu steak, sausage, hashbrown, bacon, toast, side salad and sunny side up eggs. Definitely an awesome start to the weekends!
Bandung Latte at Burpple Tastemaker Eatup last month at The Recess of The Tuckshop.
Pretty interesting idea to add bandung into the coffee!üòÇ But I still prefer it just the coffee itself or just the Bandung itself. But the idea is there already!üòâ Bonus point for the art!
3 munchies: Part of the new lunch menu, I liked how the fried rice was infused with all the bell pepper fragrance and every spoonful had salmon and eggs in it. I was hoping for a stronger flavour of garlic, though. Refinement is needed for this ordinary dish that attempts to be fusion.\n<br />This was a hosted meal by The Tuckshop.
Pulled char Siew with kong bak bun. Delicious max? Why would you NOT order this?
In a place that offers a wide variety of western brunch and lunch, this carrot cake was underestimated for sure. The first bite would prove your doubt wrong. The cubes\' crispy \"skin\" and soft-smooth interior are so delicately addictive as they are mixed with chives, hae bee hiam and sambal. A great \"local\" way to start your meal and definitely an awesome alternative to your normal boring selection of appetisers.
Many do not know what a pescatarian is &amp; will usually give a look when I tell them what it is. but yes friends, it\'s a legit word &amp; there are people who have it as a diet. \n<br />So for those who are pescatarian, The Tuckshop has this Torched Salmon (S$20) that comes with semi-cooked Atlantic Salmon, Poached Eggs, Ebiko Roe, Asparagus, DouBanJiang Hollandaise &amp; Croissant! What I love is how well cooked the salmon is &amp; how the DBJ Hollandaise complements the Ebiko roe &amp; salmon altogether! It\'s that good that those at my table were happily licking off every last bit üôä \n<br />This was a hosted meal from @burpple &amp; @thetuckshop! x
Have a platter fit for a king - presenting The Tuckshop\'s Breakfast for Champions (aka for the meat lover or the hungover)! This platter is soooo filling it\'s good enough for 2! It consists wagyu steak, jumbo pork sausage, eggs, hash brown, bacon &amp; toast! Now tell me, would you still be having the blues?
Crispy carrot cake, sambal chilli &amp; chives, this little side dish can be eaten anytime &amp; with anything! Personally, I would either pair it with their bottled Iced White or a bottle of craft beer! \n<br />Thank you @burpple &amp; @thetuckshop for this hosted meal! \n<br />#Burpple #burppleeatup #burppletastemakers #aroundwithamd #thetuckshopxtherecess
If you are swinging by @thetuckshop for some brunch today, do not miss out, I mean MUST ORDER The Tuckshop Carrot Cake ($6)! The crispy carrot cubes are sprinkled with magical seasoning which made them extremely addictive! (Though the menu wrote - sambal sauce &amp; chive, but my tastebuds says magical seasoning üòÇ) Easily one of our favourite dishes, not too long later, all was left was that white claypot!
A clear winner in last weekend\'s eatup at The Tuckshop is their crispy fried carrot cake! At $6, the unassuming bowl of chunky golden brown carrot cake cubes was my favourite among the spread offered. Served with fried shallots, chives and sambal hidden at the bottom, the combination brings about an awesome fragrance to the dish!
The pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the dish are the Eggs Benedict covered with Doubanjiang (creamy bean) sauce. However, the nicely cured torched salmon stood out more for me with its light touch of saltiness and freshness coming full circle. That slab of salmon was the winner for me. \n<br />Thanks to @thetuckshop for hosting and @burpple for the kind invitation.\n<br />_
The most prominent feature would be their Doubanjiang Hollandaise sauce topped with ebiko roes on poached eggs - strongly resembles the sauce covering of a certain sushi place in Wisma üòâ  Comrades were scraping every single remaining sauce there is - proofs how addictive it was!
What can go wrong with a plate of fried rice? I found it ordinary because it tastes just alright. The biggest turn-off for me is the frozen veggies because, uh, well, the wrinkled peas scare me off.
Dig this Chili Srambled Eggs with Crab ($20) comes with cripsy fried mantou and cream croquettes! \n<br />Please keep you eyes on your food, before people snatch it up! üòÇ
Overall a pretty good drink especially in this horrible weather. The cold brew was slightly sweeter than expected and could be slightly creamier and stronger!
For the month of September, we were hosted in the lovely space next to @thetuckshop called The Recess. \n<br />This little space is dressed with old school vibes - think Pick Up Sticks, Straw Chairs &amp; ChupTeh. A lovely space for get-together &amp; with amazing food!
Can I be your friend?
Of Jumbo Pork Sausage, Hashbrowns, Poached Eggs with Dou Ban Jiang Hollandaise Sauce on Artisan Bread with my favourite saut√©ed Mushrooms.This will definitely make a mean breakfast to make it Terrific Tuesday üòÇ
3.5 munchies: Not the best oven-baked eggs I\'ve had, but certainly the first that was served with doubanjiang (Ë±ÜÁì£ÈÖ±; fermented bean paste) hollandaise. While the sauce had a smooth, creamy consistency and tinge of saltiness (minus the spice), it didn\'t complement the eggs baked in truffle potato mash and jamon-wrapped crispy mantou as well as it should have. Gimme the classic hollandaise and I could slather it on anything.
Shirred eggs, sitting beautifully on top of flaky pastry and truffle mashed potato, were egg-celently paired with toasted bread wrapped in jam√≥n. Psst, the nachos-cheese-looking sauce was in fact made of some dou ban jiang (fermented soy beans) to bring a tinge of sweetness. A classic French dish with a local twist to make the waiting for weekends a little more bearable.
4 munchies: Start your week right with this Healthy Salad of Barley, Pumpkin &amp; Egg ‚Äì topped with lettuce, cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts, yoghurt dressing, and honey drizzle. The extra large egg was perfectly poached. Scoop up some of the oozy yolk and eat it together with all the other fresh ingredients; every mouthful was a celebration of multi-textured goodness. I\'d highly recommend this dish for sharing to kick start a hearty brunch ahead.
4 munchies: You know it was a good omelette by looking at how wet and runny the cheesy scrambled eggs was; filled with capsicum, onions, and tomatoes. Besides the eggs that had a good bite, I also liked the nicely saut√©ed spinach and mushrooms with garlic. Vegetarians (and non-vegetarians, of course) are going to love this dish.
This is quite an unique breakfast with chunk of crab meats and chopped chilli in the scrambled eggs but the flavor of the crab meat was a bit subtle. What stood out the most goes to the corn potato cakes that were so soft, sweet and creamy! So good! I wouldn\'t mind having 10 of it by myself! üòãüòãüòã
For our Eatup yesterday, it was held at The Tuckshop\'s new social and event space located just next door, The Recess. A lovely space with a long communal table with vintage chairs and old-school toys, was able to foster a nostalgic and intimate atmosphere [the lighting was good too]. The offerings were pretty diverse with their unique local influences though eggs was a common player and I can\'t fault on their presentation! Definitely a great place for brunch.
Head on down to @thetuckshop for these gorgeous looking and indulgent plates!
It\'s brunch fare over the weekends this time! Pictured here are dishes from The Tuckshop\'s brunch menu, which btw are really really awesome. Personal favourites are the Chili Scrambled Eggs with Crab (S$20+) and the Tuckshop Breakfast of Champions (S$24+). If you\'re in in mood for something simple, their breakfast combos or granola with yogurt and fruits are great options.
Still recovering from an egg coma after the eatup this afternoon. Thank you, The Tuckshop and Burpple, for hosting us with your new brunch and lunch menu items! #BurppleTastemakers
Ever heard of doubanjiang hollandaise? Or how about mantou with your scrambled eggs? The Tuckshop\'s brunch menu features innovative local-meets-west creations along with the usual eggs and English muffins. If you\'re there, do try the Chilli scrambled eggs with crab (S$20+) which is served with some seriously addictive creamy corn potato cakes; or The Tuckshop Breakfast of Champions (S$24+) that would please any meat lover.
Thank you @Burpple for the invite and @Thetuckshop for hosting us today! Happily eating and transiting from their breakfast to lunch menu :) Really awesome to meet some new foodie faces! Love the corn cakes from the Chilli Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Crab!
Chilli Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Crab ($20). What stole the show for me was the creamy corn potato cakes that @coffeeandcravings told me to watch out for. Also, the chilli needs more spice.
One of the most value for money brunch fare, given that spread of meats. I\'m sure this would definitely please any meat lovers out there.
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Caf√© Hopping
The truth to be said, I call this my kinda \"comfort food\" to wake up to. The lovely spread will be as perfect like having breakfast by bed. The soft baked eggs with their dou ban jiang hollandaise sauce are something to look out for in this dish. The salty jamon wrapped soldiers are equally delicious and with the scent of their truffle mash enhanced this meal to the next level.\n
One of the most innovative and accommodating brunch fare I\'ve tasted. A beautiful spread of my personal fav ingredients which is; hash-browns, mushrooms, jumbo pork sausage and not forgetting their unique dou ban jiang hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs.
The TuckShop recently has launched their new menus for brunch &amp; lunch, giving a thumbs up with the food selection that was offered during the tastemakers eat up!
[The Tuckshop] If there was ever a compilation of the 7 deadly sins for food in Singapore, this Torched Salmon ($20) is definitely a contender. This is totally not fair game when diners are given such luxury like a portion of torched salmon served with poached eggs with doubanjiang (fermented beans) hollandaise sauce and a buttery fresh croissant. The coup de gr√¢ce was the ebiko roe as they were sprinkled on top of the salmon to alleviate it\'s seafood-ness and up the luxuriousness. 
Asparagus, capsicum, mushroom, onions, tomato, cheesy omelette, toasted muffins. The Tuck Shop plays to its strengths with their egg-centric brunch menu and it shows in this perfectly shaped and cooked omelette that\'s slightly melty in the middle.
Poached eggs, mushrooms, jumbo pork sausage, hash brown, dou ban jiang hollandaise, artisanal toast. Generic tasting sausage and hash brown aside, I\'d be pretty happy to wake up to this every morning.
Like a snuggle under a warm blanket on a rainy day, these soft eggs baked in subtly scented truffle potato mash, then smothered in dou ban jiang hollandaise, yes, dou ban jiang, is comfort food at its best. I found myself dipping the salty jamon wrapped soldiers in the strangely nacho-esque sauce. Delicious.\n<br />Taste: 4/5
The runny scrambled egg flecked with chilli slices and tender crab meat was outshone by its corn potato croquette compatriots, whose golden crispy crumbed exteriors broke open to give way to a creamy, velvety smooth center. Two ain\'t enough. I hardly noticed the mantou.
[The Tuckshop] Start the weekend right by having a hearty and fulfilling meal, and what better way to do that than to have The Tuckshop Breakfast of Champions ($24). A platter of goodies such as eggs, hashbrown, wagyu beef slices, bacon, greens, toast and a jumbo pork sausage is like Christmas came early. 
Wagyu steak, fried eggs, bacon, jumbo pork sausage, hash brown, artisanal toast. As the menu aptly states, for meat lovers or the hungover. The wagyu was a little too done and chewy for my liking.
[The Tuckshop] For a more alternative brunch option, give the Tuckshop Breakfast Combo 1 ($16) a go. What made the entire dish ticked is the dou ban jiang (fermented beans) hollandaise sauce on top of the poached eggs and the saut√©ed mushrooms that were just irresistible. A very rustic looking kinda meal paired with artisanal bread, hash and some greens.
[The Tuckshop] Running out of options for a decent brunch? Why not pop by The Tuckshop for some local fusion of Chilli Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Crab ($20)?
Cheesy omelette, toasted muffins and its crazy good mushrooms were enough to convince me of a revisit. If one prefers a satisfying and healthy breakfast, this dish is vegetarian friendly and would cater to everyone\'s liking! 
Tuckshop\'s roti wrap puts a spin on the typical Ozzie breakfast roll with bacon, egg, onion, tomato, mayo and sweet chilli sauce. Fairly ordinary
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Caf√© Hopping
Surprisingly good fried rice with diced carrot, onion, julienned cucumber, sliced chilli, corn, fluffy egg and generous amounts of flaked salmon. Each individual granule retained a nice bite and were well separated from each other, the hallmark of good \"char png\". The nori on top further enhanced the savouriness of the dish.
The marinated chicken was nicely tender and well seasoned, but the gnocchi I found a little too charred and doughy. Minor quip aside, it was still tasty when eaten together with the chopped soft leeks and grated parmesan. I just might try to recreate this at home.
Featuring Fruits, Grains &amp; Yoghurt ($14) and Healthy Salad of Barley, Pumpkin &amp; Egg ($16). Can\'t bear to eat them!
Once again, for lunch dates on your weekdays and brunch hangouts on your weekends. Be not afraid to dine at @thetuckshop as their recent launched lunch/brunch menus have given diners a new taste of east meets west creations.
The garden of greens, a perfect serving of healthy salad with barley and pumpkin adding along with their amazing poached egg which gave us a burst of celebration. Alongside, much love for the mixture of ingredients that does the finished work - cherry tomatoes, lettuce, toasted hazelnuts, yoghurt dressing with honey drizzled over.
Fluffy cubes of moreish crispy carrot cake with addictive hae bee hiam sambal and chives. Great with beer!
If all salads were this good I\'d be eating my greens more. An edible garden of lettuce, pumpkin, cherry tomatoes, cranberry, and crunchy roasted hazelnut on a bed of barley. Dots of tangy yoghurt dressing provide bursts of zingy freshness to the herbaceous affair, whilst the poached egg when sliced open oozes runny yolk that doubles up as sauce. What a textural playground for the taste buds.\n<br />Taste: 3.5/5
The highlight of today\'s eat up for me was this well cooked cube sized carrot cake! Initially, I was a little disappointed that the carrot cake did not come with any chili sauce, however I was taken by surprise that the chives and sambal that were underneath those carrot cakes provided me a great kick! The carrot cake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, this combination reminds me of those 60 cents carrot cake that I used to eat when I was younger. Will definitely be back to have this again! 
[The Tuckshop] Throwback to last weekend\'s tasting at The Tuckshop and it\'s always a blast during a Burpple Tastemakers Eatup session. Not only will you get a table full of food, you get the opportunity to interact and learn from fellow foodies. During such sessions, it\'s always filled with chatter and laughter as we drown ourselves with food and drinks.
A pretty plate certainly, but I question the sanity of anyone who willingly pays for something you can essentially make at home in 5 minutes for a fraction of the price.
A good way to start off the meal would be this appetizer that kept everyone\'s hands busy. The Parmesan cheese topped onto the fries were a great combination with the truffle mayo! The truffle sauce wasn\'t overwhelming at all and I practically finished entire sauce given. Many thanks to @raine for being the hand model here!

Usually when I think of The Tuckshop, I think late night drinks. But after trying their brunch today, it\'s definitely a place I would hop to for brunch if I\'m out in the East.\n<br />The creamy corn potato cakes on this dish were soft and fluffy‚Äîmy favourite thing on this plate. Loved how this dish incorporates local asian flavours with the crispy mantou and very mild \"chili crab\" scramble.\n<br />Thanks @nomnom.sg &amp; @thetuckshop for this tasting!\n<br />#TheTuckshop #NomNomSG *
Full review here: chueonit.com/2015/09/20/the-tuck shop-Guillemard-road ‚Ä¢ If I had breakfast like this, I would wake up smiling everyday. The Breakfast of Champions is a meatlover\'s feast of eggs, pork sausage, bacon, wagyu steak, hash browns and artisanal toast. Perfect for two or if you\'re really starving. So really, breakfast of champions, wagyu waiting for? 
How\'s your day coming along? Mine just started but I think it will be pretty awesome!üòÅ Let me bring to you this dish from @thetuckshop which is soft eggs baked in truffle mash potato with jamon wrapped soldiers!‚úåüèªÔ∏è It might just unleash the \"soldier\" within you after eating it!\n<br />‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ
Our favorite goes to the Torched Salmon but if you want to live and eat like a champion, go for their Breakfast of Champion which consists of almost everything you need for breakfast including Waygu beef! üòãüòãüòã
I\'d say go for the Torched Salmon ($20) - semi cooked Atlantic salmon, ebiko roe, poached eggs, doubanjiang hollandaise and croissant! The Breakfast for Champions also features Wagyu beef at just $24 too! üòç
Archi pelago is one of my favourite beer cos\' it\'s quite light. Summer ale was fruity, and we had a Tuckshop Edition - calamansi and gula melaka!!! Very light. Could taste a hint of calamansi which was interesting. The Tuckshop has a lot of old school stuff!! Like their plates, free Â±±Ê•Ç? And the bubble balloon. Happy hour everyday 5-7pm, $11 for a pint.
This bar seems like a really great place to chill out with friends. The Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream comes sandwiched between 2 pieces of cookies. I had no idea how to eat this apart from eating it layer by layer, which kind of defeats the purpose of having it in a sandwich form. the cookies were definitely too hard to bite through with the quickly melting ice cream in between. And what else could be better than a shot of Bailey‚Äôs? Bailey‚Äôs topped off with a heap of milo! Perfect ending. 
Tuck Shops are known for local delights but they revamped it into new age concept with many unique dishes prepared by the chef. Here\'s one of the dish! Perhaps it gets alittle dry after eating it for a moment. Alittle of gravy on it definitely makes it better!
Yummy dinner at this hidden find. Really enjoyed our pastas that toyed with asian elements. The truffle fries were just alright though | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
We went there to try the signature fish &amp; chips but were sorely disappointed that they didn\'t serve that till 1130am. So we settled for a ham &amp; mushroom omelette which was done just the way we liked--firm on the outside and warm &amp; runny on the inside. We enjoyed the omelette so much I forgot to take pics! The potato salad isn\'t on the menu but you can request for it. It\'s good stuff and I would have polished it off if I hadn\'t already stuffed my face with the omelette. 
Hey, Turkish friends. Look, we have mez√© here our parts of the world too. Awesome curry chicken in one bowl, clams in another and nice prawns too. If that\'s not enough, lets get some mushrooms or luncheon meat fritters...oh wait, you can\'t have the last one. But there\'s plenty more for you to try. | #food #tapas #meze #dinner #drinks #bargrub #instaweekend
Ice-cream for the grown-ups ;) Cookies &amp; Cream, and After Eight.
Yummy stuff! Lovely place to chill and unwind - unpretentious, relaxing ambience, genuine and friendly stuff. Great food, beers and ciders. Just gotta bear with annoying flies if you\'re seated outdoors.

Sweet cider with a subtle hint of toffee, tastes like cream soda...
This place is surprisingly near the mrt and a good place to chill and relax as the lights shines in from the kitchen! 
Taste pretty similar to Starbucks Xmas Toffeenut latte! Happy hour @ The Tuckshop Cafe is 3-5pm. Order any coffee &amp; get complimentary mini cakes! The cakes are goooood despite their size! The lemon cake is very zesty. Yums.

Carrot cake ($9) was my favourite, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the chilli was super addictive. (Although there seems to have a significant jump in price since last year). As for the truffle fries ($10), pork floss wings ($10) and mushroom linguine ($16), they were all pretty decent. \n<br />Charges gst but not service charge.\n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodie #pizza #chickenwings #fries #pasta #burpple

Really lived up to its reputationüëçüèª

What made the entire dish ticked is the dou ban jiang (fermented beans) hollandaise sauce on top of the poached eggs and the saut√©ed mushrooms that were just irresistible. A very rustic looking kinda meal paired with artisanal bread, hash and some greens.\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, if you haven\'t heard the alternate version of 21 Guns, performed by the cast of American Idiot musical, you should. It totally rocks and one of the best adaptions of a song.\n<br />.\n<br />This was a hosted meal by @thetuckshop and many thanks to @Burpple for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 403 Guillemard Road, Singapore 399795\n<br />============================\n<br />Now playing: üé∂ Green Day - 21 Guns (Cast Version) üé∂\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #TastemakersEatup #foodporn #foodphoto #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
Why not pop by The Tuckshop for some local fusion of Chilli Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Crab ($20)?\n<br />.\n<br />A deconstructed version from the usual chilli crab dish that you can find in restaurants and zhi tzar stalls, The Tuckshop does an excellent rendition which sets them apart from the usual eggs benedict order in other cafes. Not only will you get huge chunks of crab meat in the eggs, there\'s some rocket, creamy potato croquettes and even a deep fried mantou to pair with the chilli crab egg. Our table gobbled down everything in no time.\n<br />.\n<br />This was a hosted meal by @thetuckshop and many thanks to @Burpple for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 403 Guillemard Road, Singapore 399795\n<br />============================\n<br />Now playing: üé∂ Kodaline - High Hopes üé∂\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #TastemakersEatup #foodporn #foodphoto #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
Not only will you get a table full of food, you get the opportunity to interact and learn from fellow foodies. During such sessions, it\'s always filled with chatter and laughter as we drown ourselves with food and drinks.\n<br />.\n<br />Besides the very eggy spread of food, we were given a tray of Truffle Fries ($10) for starters and it was so addictive that some of us can be seen sneakily eating them away while the rest are busy taking a shot at another table. Very distinct truffle aroma and the shaved Parmesan cheese makes this dish a must order item for sharing as you await the entrees to arrive. Also, The Tuckshop Carrot Cake ($6) is another winner with the fried chunky white radish cake coated in a dry spice rub.\n<br />.\n<br />This was a hosted meal by @thetuckshop and many thanks to @Burpple for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: 403 Guillemard Road, Singapore 399795\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #TastemakersEatup #foodporn #foodphoto #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
