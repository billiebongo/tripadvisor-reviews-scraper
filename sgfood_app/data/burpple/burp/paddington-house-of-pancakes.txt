Originally from Malaysia, and now it\'s here! Some damn good filling pancakes, with some iced chocolate and iced mocha for the humid weather!
Chocolate Icecream, Dollar-pancakes, Mini Marshmallows &amp; Chocolate Sauce. Price of $10. Absolutely recommended. Chewy, yummy pancakes in little cute bite-sizes. 
it was superb! a very big portion of food, actually it looks small but it\'s filling, good for those who eat a lot. 
French Crepes with grilled mozzarella chicken, turkey bacon, mushrooms, prawns, pineapples and creamy mushroom sauce. So skinny like some models sia!
Singapore\'s first speciality pancakes house featuring the Classic Buckleberry. Blueberry pancakes with scrambled eggs, mushrooms and turkey bacon, and served with maple syrup.
I\'m a potato lover! Cheesy Fries and Wedges!
Not bad.. luckily go during others\' working hours.. enjoying the quietness
$18. Probably the worst Aglio Olio I\'ve ever tasted. Not worth the money, mates. 
$10 Mini pancakes, marshmallows and chocolate ice cream served with chocolate sauce. I think it\'s much more filling than their pasta. 
Full of caramel, digestive crumbs, grill banana, cream chz cubes, double ice cream on a piece of creps.
One of their best dishes among all that I have tried today :) 
The meat patties are sandwiched with pancakes and not buns! Something new to try out. Mutton patty is really soft and tasty. Chicken patty is tender but kind of dry. Nonetheless, if you live for pancakes, go to Phop as they have 100+ pancakes to choose from!
The Full Monty ~ Original flapjacks with pastrami, chipolatas, turkey and chicken bacon, mozzarella, baked beans and topped with double sunny side up eggs!
Mexican burger made of buckwheat pancake muffins, with chicken and lamb patties, onions, pineapple ring, tomato, avocado, double grilled cheese, gherkins and fries. I conquered this tower all by myself!
Spam Pancakes for dinner TGIW!
You can literally travel around the world with their huge variety of pancakes üåçüåéüåè
Backtoschool lunch earlier today with bananas and pineapples in pancakes! Perfect with the toffee caramel sauce!

Starting off my foodie journal on the right note, pancakes! Here, they serve up mean dishes of savory flapjacks as well as main dishes with nothing short of well, pancakes. This place is da bomb if ya\'ll are looking for some tummy filling breakfast x dinner. 4 outta 5 popcorns üëå
A treasure box of goodies! Dollar pancakes hidden beneath sweet peaches, strawberries and huge juicy lychees. All that topped with a scoop of ice cream and Hawaiian coconut shavings. I am so happy!!!!!! #phop
Can I interest you with some Dutch pannekoek? If not, how about that topped with hot toffee bananas, cream cheese cubes, peanut butter, shaved Hawaiian coconut and a double scoop of vanilla ice cream? üòâ
This was our Treasure Box after brunch, so much yummy stuff in a bowl! Mini pancakes flooded by super juicy lychees, sweet strawberries and sliced peaches topped with an ice cream and coconut flakes. WAH!!
It\'s a Nice crepe. Yes this crepe is nice. Nice is this crepe\'s name.
Good morning! Ushering the weekend with some crepes and pancakes (not pictured) with @joshua_ng! ‚òÄ
Twice visited this place. Not the most homy, but hey you go here to get yourself some pancakes. Truly spoiled with the choices here.
We were so full after eating this, there wasn\'t any space left for dessert! Meal wasn\'t very special but the pancake was pretty good! Didn\'t exactly feel that it was worth the $13!
American meal. Quite filling and affordable too. Overall it was a good dinner over at Paddington üòä
Definitely a YES to come here for Pancakes if ever u have pancake cravings. The prices are pretty reasonable for such a HUGE serving! Not only that, there are SO MANY choices to choose from!!!!!!!! The only tough part, is to choose what to eat because everything looks soooo good!! I ordered the Oreo Pancakes &amp; it was really good!! But it was too much for me üò≠ Can\'t wait to go back again!! 
#burpple
But the scrambled egg definitely need more work, would prefer if the eggs not so well done. Haha #burpple
The lamb have fats that are hard to chew. The meat was thin so it became medium well to well done which is a bit tough for me. But overall the seasoning of the lamb is spot on\n<br />The mint sauce is a bit weak as I like my mint sauce to be strong with mint flavour\n<br />The zucchini pancake at the bottom is awesome! Seasoning is spot on!\n<br />*it\'s halal*
It\'s crunchy outside and soft in the middle (crepe)\n<br />Meat wasn\'t overcooked\n<br />Overall- a good experienceüòä\n<br />*it\'s halal*
Here at paddington house of pancakes. They really know how to do it really well. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Will be back again.

Made with real blueberries! (Special request for the plain eggs)
Awesome!
Crepes with grilled mixed seafood &amp; creamy tomato. Tasted just like tomato soup with seafoods in it. I think I rather stick to the pancake...
Zucchini &amp; onion pancake with grilled herbed lamb shoulders &amp; yogurt mint sauce. The lamb was ok but the pancake was quite tasteless &amp; don\'t really match with the lamb.
I will love this if the bacons were crispy...
Soft fluffy pancake. Great for breakfast or even dessert!!
Food was good but we kena pressured to leave seats._. #nomnom #burpple
