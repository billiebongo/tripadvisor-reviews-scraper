The slice of cake was served with a generous amount of popcorn on top.\n<br /> It was moist and soft yet crunchy along with the popcorn. 😍\n<br />It is quite sweet though, so I would recommend this for those with sweet tooth! \n<br />Price : $7\n<br />Recommend : 7/10
☕️Coffee yet? I\'m heading for one now :) Have a great day ahead!
A quaint cafe along Simon Rd (Kovan MRT), Lola\'s Cafe features good coffee and scrumptious desserts. Highly recommended for a light afternoon tea date!
@lolascafesg has introduced a brand new brunch menu and this Sausage Breakfast Stew with Rye Toasts is one of their new babies. It tastes like a lighter version of Bolognese sauce with sausage, Chorizo beans, tomato, spinach and poached eggs.
4 munchies: Dark chocolate ganache topped with light and smooth Bailey\'s espresso cream. Besides the crust that was moist and chocolatey, I also loved the sea salt sprinkles that balanced out the richness and bitterness of the semi-sweet chocolate. This is perfect for afternoon tea! #Burpproved

I think the cinnamon powder added to the ice cream really gives a boost to the already delicious dessert! Love it! $7
On this single toasted brioche was pesto and sautéed mushrooms with poached eggs, and it tasted wonderful. Liked the crunchy texture with some cereal and pickled radish. \n<br />Also tried their Crabcake Benedict with miso hollandise which was strong in flavour. If you like strong coffee and love some alcohol occasionally, you gotta check out their Bailey\'s affogato.
The scrambled eggs were soft and rather creamy. Accompanied by the crispy and fresh butter croissant, the mix of paprika, honey, and ham made for an explosion of flavour in ones mouth.
3rd times (review) a charm? Perhaps it\'s true! The first few visits weren\'t memorable &amp; i couldn\'t understand why it remains so popular. But i\'m starting to enjoy @lolascafesg , the more times i try out their stuff. 😃 See previous 2 recent postings for more info.
Quaint little cafe\'s in \"random\" neighbourhoods are always highly appreciated! Ok i think i\'m finally getting why it\'s popularity remains! 😃 @lolascafesg is a charming cafe that even though isn\'t the best, but will always keep you coming back. Previous review 5 days ago.
Perennial question of the day: What should i have for lunch? 😃 Have been to @lolascafesg 4 times for dinner, each time leaving unimpressed. Finally checking out the brunch menu; croissants with egg, ham, bacon etc... Uhhh okay, normal stuff how good can it get right? I’m sure it will be a soggy mess by the time it\'s delivered by @ubereats_sg . But boy, was it good! Throughly enjoyed it ❤
A dark chocolate ganache tart that has a light coffee cream to cut through the richness and balanced out with a dash of sea salt — afternoon tea goals 😇
2nd visit to Lola\'s. The creamy avocado and hollandaise sauce go well together with the brioche bread and pork ham. Pairing the avocado eggs benedict ($14.00) with a cup of cappuccino ($5.00) makes a satisfying brunch!
Couldn\'t get enough of Lola\'s and I went back again to try their eggs benedict on toast.
Yeah. As the title said, I visited Lola\'s cafe unexpectedly although it was listed in my interested places list for at least 2 years! Hahaha! Glad that they are still opening. Initially thinking of getting the Claypot chicken as brunch, but they are not operating in the morning! So...who said that early bird has good meal???!! Hmmm... anyway, Lola\'s isn\'t that bad though, just that I wanted to try their dinner and dessert instead. Btw, my baileys affogato is superb! Not that pricey too.
This is huge and yummy! Serving was bigger than expected, like how the dish was simple yet nice.
Not too sweet fluffy cake topped with caramel popcorn for some crunch
I feel that the food here is alright but slightly overpriced for it\'s taste? Perhaps the desserts are nicer?
Rich chocolate cake with crunchy bits and nicely spiced self filter chai latte
Can\'t wait for our HK trip 😍\n<br />Any places to recommend?😁
B had Lola\'s Full Work\'s &amp; I had Egg Atlantic (read other review)..B was hungry and even the portion was sufficient to satisfy his hunger! Ingredients was fresh &amp; once a while, if you wanna pamper yourself to a Hearty Brunch, this would be the order you need! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Eggs Atlantic was recommended to me for weekend brunch and I would say, the recommendation was a hit! Pricing is slightly higher but the ingredients was fresh, service was superb! On just their excellent service &amp; attention, I would recommend this place on a weekend brunch with friends, buddy or a cozy catchup! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Wasn\'t really going for a full meal then so my friend recommended that we go for their sides. We had the wings, as well as mashed potatoes with sausage. Surprisingly, the portions were substantial, and the taste was superb. 
Located in the heartlands, Kovan, we had @lolascafesg Honey Paprika Crispy Wings ($10). Fried chicken wings that were both crispy and juicy, coated in honey and spices. Non-spicy as well, a great side dish for everyone! 😉
A CroissantWich! @lolascafesg Breakfast Butter Croissant ($15) is a great brunch item that has the best of both worlds. Crispy butter croissant filled with a generous serving of creamy scrambled eggs, pork ham, honey bacon, cheddar cheese and honey mayo. Served with garden salad and balsamic dressing on the side. Such a hearty brunch that starts off your day right! 😉
We all need to start the day right with a great breakfast. Nothing says great breakfast like Lola\'s Full Works ($17) from @lolascafesg With honey baked ham, honey bacon, pork sausage, sweet cherry tomato confit, scrambled eggs, toasted rye bread, garden salad and balsamic dressing. A mixture of different flavours and texture that gives you enough energy to take on anything for the rest of the day! 😁
Loved this. The brownie squares were fudgy and the scoop of Earl Grey ice cream on top was nice. The toffee in the side bowl added some decadence to the dessert. Yums!
Delicious wings that did not disappoint after reading the many reviews. Crisp and juicy.
Scramble egg is fluffy...a good mix of salty and sweet...and the matcha green tea latte is delectable~!!!
The portion of smoked salmon was SO GENEROUS. The sauce was not too bad as well! Really worth it for $16 &amp; there isn\'t service charge as well! 
The wings were very succulent and full of flavour. The spiciness was not over the top and contributed nicely to the overall taste. The skin was fried to a tender crisp and every bite made me feel like heaven. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back for more. 
I\'ve been wanting to try Lola\'s Cafe for such a long time but because of its purple-line location.....I hesitated. Last Saturday, I finally visited this place and settled my Saturday brunch with my mum. We didn\'t have to wait for too long considering how it was a Saturday.. I just found it a bit strange that they had two separate units side by side and the service staff have to walk and pass through doors just to serve coffee. I\'ve heard a lot about the pasta dishes but I was so disappointed when I realized that was a dinner item :( Nevertheless, we ordered Lola\'s specialities like the Honey Paprika Wings, Breakfast Croissant, Nacho Cheese Fries and a cup of iced cappuccino. I overestimated myself when I ordered the Breakfast Croissant because I expected it to be a standard croissant size (which wasn\'t going to be enough because I was soooo hungry). It turned out to be sooooooooo huge and filling I felt like I was stuffing myself and forcing myself to finish. It looked really good and the scrambled eggs were fluffy yet creamy and not too salty. The croissant was still crispy and when I sank my mouth in, the only thing that bothered me was this sweet sauce from the croissant. I\'m not really a fan of sweet things and I realized it came from the honey mayo and honey bacon inside. It would have been perfect if there wasn\'t honey mayo, so it\'s something I\'ll opt out for the next time I return :) 
There\'s just something about their fries..... It\'s really really really nice. I was swaying between ordering this or their truffle fries but I\'ve been having truffle fries at practically every cafe so time for something new! A super sinful dish but worth the calories! 
This is such a bad picture but I feel like I should say something about this place.. So my friends and I decided to try this place since there\'s always a 15-30 min queue outside the shop. Because of that, I expected the food to be pretty darn great, since the price was pretty up there too (or maybe I\'m just not used to Singaporean cafés\' pricing, and the exchange rate 🙄🙄🙄)\n<br />So we ordered Breakfast Butter Croissant ($15), Smoked Pulled Pork Sanger ($15), Lola\'s Full Works ($17), and Truffle Fries ($12).  They were Okay, but not fantastic, almost too complicated. \n<br />I first tried the scrambled eggs from Lola\'s Full Works and after 3 bites it got jelak, they put some kind of cheese or something creamy on top of it and I am NOT a fan of that.. Everything else on the plate was drenched in the \'juice\' of the omelette so that wasn\'t very pleasant at all.. Most expensive plate and my least favorite.\n<br />As for the Butter Croissant, still a lot happening in one bite but the ham and bacon cuts the richness of the scrambled eggs.\n<br />I think my favorite, besides the standard truffle fries, was the Pulled Pork Sanger. It wasn\'t drenched in sauce, just enough flavor, we found the texture almost like tuna sandwich which was interesting.. 
A cafe nested at a corner of kovan. Nice location. Banger and mesh served with onion sauce.. I find it slightly sweet... The crispy chicken is quite good. 
Nacho Cheese Fries ($8), Honey Paprika Crispy Wings ($10), Bacon &amp; Mushroom Truffle Cream Pasta ($15) and Confit of Duck Leg with Honey Mustard Sauce ($17). Generous slab of cheese, sweet crispy wings, flavorful pasta and well marinated duck. Service and ambience matches the food and it\'s the perfect recipe to a great cafe. Just make sure to make a reservation! \n<br />Enough said, the picture says it all. \n<br />Final opinion 👇🏼\n<br />Take Me? (Oh yess!! Every week?)\n<br />Feed Me? (I will exercise often just to indulge in those beauties)
Dessert // Odd Fellow \n<br />Passion fruit curd, basil ice cream, cereal crumbs, meringue 
The Little Brownie Jar ($7.50) is pure joy in a jar. Velvety, rich, moist and pillow-soft brownie is jammed into a jar and is paired with a generous globe of strong yet light earl grey ice cream. The fantastic frozen dairy treat cuts through the richness of the brownie and adds a new depth of flavor and a tremendous new texture to the dessert. It\'s then topped off with thick, full bodied caramel sauce to make the dessert just that much more decadent.
They said it was their speciality so my friends and I ordered this plate of chicken to try out. Wow, mind blown. It is really good!!!! You can taste the honey and the spice very obviously. And also, their brunch; Served with scrambled eggs and avocado. Who does that!!? Well, Lola\'s do. 
Scrambled eggs croissant and bacon inside. The eggs were so fluffy with the pastry flaky and soft. Good dish going at only $16
Seasalt Chocolate Tart with Coffee Cream ($5) &amp; Flat White ($5 nett). Easily polished off the rich and crumbly chocolate tart myself and washed down with a medium bodied flat white.
Duck confit had very crispy skin and the meat inside was moist and flavorful. Appreciated the tangy honey mustard sauce which cut through the oiliness of the duck. Would be perfect if there were more greens on the plate. One of my favorite dinner item at Lola\'s. 
As I browsing through the list of cafes for my friends and I to cafe hop, Lola\'s Cafe brought my attention. Seeing the reviews made and recommendations, I thought my friends and I can give this cafe a try to see if it\'s really worth the hype!\n<br />Ordered Breakfast Butter Croissant ($15), Eggs Atlantic ($16), Truffle Fries ($12), Organic Iced Chai Tea Latte ($6) and Iced Strawberry Fruit Tea ($4.50)\n<br />For the Breakfast Butter Croissant, the croissant was crispy and buttery, complementing the scrambled eggs and bacon with a pinch of smoked paprika with a side of rocket salad with balsamic vinegar.\n<br />For the Eggs Atlantic, the eggs were perfectly poached, salmon was fresh, having the rocket salad as well, all complementing with the toast underneath.\n<br />For the Truffle Fries, it\'s worth the price because of portion and the truffle flavour was strong enough unlike the truffle fries I\'ve tried in other cafes. \n<br />For the drinks, the Chai Tea Latte was pleasant and the Strawberry Tea was refreshing. \n<br />Food and service are good. Except that the WiFi isn\'t open to public unfortunately. But it is worth the hype and would highly recommend all to give it a try. \n<br />On a side note: No service charge! :)
While it\'s essentially just a deconstructed ice cream cone, I give it props for the amazing caramel iced bananas and the delicious peanut butter ice cream. The flavors mixed really well together, especially the brownie bits and ice cream. While I\'m not usually a fan of peanut butter, the peanut butter taste was just right, and not too overpowering. It\'s not too filling, so it\'s perfect for sharing with a friend after your meal. 
PRICE: Nacho cheese fries $8, Honey paprika wings $10, Bangers and mash $10, Cappuccino $5
Another amazing cafe that sells delicious food and drinks, and also at a reasonable price!
The Breakfast Butter Croissant @ $15 nett is my all time favorite brunch item. It came with scrambled eggs, ham, honey bacon and cheese. The scrambled eggs didn\'t taste milky and wasn\'t too runny or rubbery. Love the hint of sweetness in the tender honey bacon and the buttery croissant that remained crispy to the last bite. 
Pretty affordable desserts here. You should try all their plated desserts!!!
Snooze the whole day because I am too tired 😂. Craving for the French Toast ($9) - beautifully caramelized and slightly toasted on the exterior. This is then paired with a scoop of handcrafted milk ice cream, seasonal fruits and maple syrup. \n<br />Unique milk flavour ice cream enhanced the overall flavour, and the interior of the French toast was so soft that it could melt in your mouth! \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Woke up at the wrong side of bed so ended up with a stiff neck. One word - SHAG! Anyway, The Debbie ($10) was served with Peanut and Caramel ice cream, Black Cookies, Brownie, Peanut Brittle and Caramel Sautéed Banana. \n<br />Indeed a messy affair, and the peanut ice cream seems like an unusual combination with caramel, a breakthrough from mainstream salted caramel pairing. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my blog!
Had the most interesting lunch this afternoon, courtesy of the collaboration between @kiehlssg and @lolascafesg!
The thought of these delicious chicken wings makes me drool~😋 They are served with the perfect crispiness level, coupled with the strong fragrance of the honey paprika, you could keep eating them all day😍 See our new article on Lola\'s Cafe at http://thehungrygeek.com/2016/01/20/lolas-cafe-truffle-fries-honey-paprika-wings/
It\'s their avocado egg benedict. I like the poached eggs here! It\'s runny but still sticky. The deep orange yolk reminds of organic eggs which I always buy and cook when I was studying in the States.
We didn\'t think that the wings were well marinated. While we like the spices and fried batter, what\'s good is mostly skin deep. The chicken is still juicy inside though, and what\'s very very good is the honey that they drizzle on top of the wings 😋
In frame: Croissant breakfast sandwich. \n<br />Simple pleasures, nothing fancy, just a hearty breakfast. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #lolascafe
I\'m finally back at Lola\'s which is just a few busstops away from Monster\'s cave. They\'ve took over the store space next door to ease the constant congestion they see on a daily basis. \n<br />The sandwich in particular is alright. I loved the punch of purple cabbage that gave it a nice crunch. It made for a pretty picture too. The pork was tender but the flavors were lacking in depth. Perhaps a little cumin would give it that additional oomph! \n<br />Monster likes the feeling of rolling out of his cave right into brunch.\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Moist and not to sweet, so it\'s perfect! Definitely a must-try for chocolate lovers :)
Succulent and crispy wings drizzled with honey and adorned with paprika flakes, this is a must order indeed. Pair this with a cup of hot beverage and you\'re good to go on this rainy day.
Super yummy honey wings ($10), croissant ($15) and Lola\'s full work ($17) and ice latte ($5.50) which is not too sweet. Went on a tues afternoon, queued for around 10 mins. Staffs are friendly and service was good 👍🏻 worth returning! 
Very carrot-cakeish, if you\'re into that. There are pineapple chunks inside which is very refreshing. Cream cheese frosting is also always welcome. The cake was moist, and quite light, so if you\'re not in the mood for something so heavy like chocolate this is a good option. 
It is exactly how it looks: a huge pile of fries drenched generously in nacho cheese. At $8.90, they do give a large quantity. However, it can get a little gelat after a while, given all the cheese and fries. 
5 munchies: LOVED the caramelisation on the outside of the brioche – pan-fried with clarified butter – as well as the warm and moist interior that was injected with maple milk. Drizzled with maple syrup, the sour mixed berries and lightness of the milk ice cream complemented the pastry perfectly. @geekyelephant and I devoured the new Lola\'s dessert in 3 minutes!
We went at 11am and we had to wait for a table, which we didn\'t mind as the food arrived pretty quickly afterwards. We ordered the Rosewater Lychee Cake, Salted Caramel Popcorn Cake ($7 each), the famous wings ($10) and the truffle fries ($12)! It\'s a great brunch choice for a few friends to enjoy 👍🏼
I don\'t care if there\'re many reviews already but I must express my love for these wings. The wings were so crispy you could hear it crack as you bite into it. It\'s not very oily so your hands won\'t get too greasy. The honey sauce added just the right sweetness to the wings and overall a 10/10. Also had their plated desserts but the portion was very small and wasn\'t worth the price.
On a side note, it was my first time going to Lola\'s Cafe a few weeks back and we were served with these delicately crafted, best selling tarts and my favourite is definitely the lemon meringue. It\'s been awhile since I had a good key lime/lemon tart. Any recommendations?
Deconstructed desserts are usually associated with fine(r)-dining, but Lola\'s now offers a small variety of plated desserts. Ranging from just $7 to $10, these lovely treats taste as good as they look! Go for the beautifully caramelised French Toast ($9) or the Odd Fellow ($7), a refreshing combination of zippy passion fruit curd and basil ice cream.
Have you checked out Lola\'s range of tarts?\n<br />Sweet dreams!\n<br />#LolasCafeSG
⋅\n<br />Like this new French Toast dessert at Lola\'s cafe. The outside is torched so that it\'s slightly crisp and caramelised, whilst the thoroughly moist core is milky and subtly sweet. I could even do without the milk ice cream. Just gimme that chunk of French Toast! 😋\n<br />⋅\n<br />#LolasCafeSG #FrenchToast #Dessert
Sweet dreams are made of… peanut butter ice cream, black cookie, sauteed bananas and peanut brittle. This dessert is perfect for little kids to get their paws on and is one of the new desserts available at Lola\'s.\n<br />⋅\n<br />Thanks to @ryllyx for the invite and @lolascafesg for hosting us!\n<br />#LolasCafeSG #IceCream #Dessert
If you are heading to the cafe, do try out their new food menu and plated desserts, besides ordering the honey wings (of cause!). This was a hosted dessert tasting by @lolascafesg and many thanks to @ryllyx for the invite.
An upside down ice cream served with caramelized bananas and drizzled with chocolate sauce n brownie crumbs. It tasted alright but certainly not worth 10 bucks. I\'d rather the french toast.
Very addictive set of wings, especially when coated with the honey sauce which you come to a realization that you have finished eating one piece in quick fashion and your hands are inching towards the second.
A brioche French toast that\'s served with milk ice cream and maple syrup is one of the latest star studded plated desserts from Lola\'s and my favourite out of the 3. The magical touch was the caramelized sugar coating on the outer layer. We were also told that maple cream was pumped into the toast to create a soft, fluffy and buttery texture, which was oh-so-good.
Last night\'s sugar high with Lola\'s for their plates desserts tasting and we kicked off the session with a set of 3 tarts and the Odd Fellow. I\'ve had a pretty bad experience with basil ice cream previously but the hint of basil flavour went really well with its passion fruit purée. And oh those meringue slices on the sides melt in your mouth like marshmallows on fire..........
An intense matcha latte, on a cold cold day, with a book on hand is about the best feeling there is.......in a cafe. This definitely wouldn\'t disappoint matcha lovers!
Cutting into the French Toast ($9) featured here which has a interesting caramelised layer, making slightly crunchy on the exterior while it remains moist and soft on the inside. Goes really well with the vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. Perfect for sweet tooths (like me) for a comforting treat.
Like this cup of coffee, are you all empty inside yet trying to continue the same? Time to set new goals and stick your mind to it!! 
The french toast (top) was recommend by their waitress and it was really good. The french toast is oozing with honey and melts in ur mouth. Served with a side of vanilla ice cream which went perfectly with it. The bottom was the lola\'s chocolate cake which taste ok. Dark chocolate so not too sweet. However the sponge cake wasnt that fantastic as it had quite a grainy texture.
Brioche Bread, Avocado, Poached Eggs, Pork Ham, Hollandaise Sauce, Meslun &amp; Lemon Dressing ($14). Available for brunch from 10am-3pm. It was a delightful meal, and one of their best presented brunches, though I think I would have preferred it served on a lightly toasted ciabatta instead of the brioche. I will say, Lola\'s Cafe is one of my favourite cafes of all time. You MUST try the starters and the desserts. They\'re all fantastic. What a wonderful menu! I\'ll just keep coming till I\'ve tried everything. Thumbs up!
Dark chocolate tart sprinkled with coarse salt that helps to keep the tart less chocolatey and sweet. 
Lola\'s Cafe recently expanded their shop space into the neighboring unit and 7 Simon Road serves as an extension that serves plated desserts and other sweets while also servicing the mad weekend brunch crowds here. Odd Fellow is one of the three plated desserts on the menu; Passionfruit Curd, Basil Ice-Cream, Cereal Crumble and Meringue. Notably the dessert felt loosely based on Thai flavours possibly due to the use of basil in the ice-cream which gives a sweet herb flavour, accompanied by the tart Passionfruit curd. Meringue was crumbly and sweet, though starts becoming sticky after a while. Wasn\'t really a big fan of the cereal crumbles which leaves an aftertaste; perhaps they could go with Graham Cookie crumbles instead which would round off the dessert better. At $7 though, this is probably good as all things go; after-all there aren\'t many around serving plated desserts in a cafe setting and certainly not in such price range. 
The burger bread was soft and doughy, just how I like it. The fried crispy chicken fillet was okay. Wasn\'t too crazy about the fries because I personally like soft and \'lembek\' fries.. And these were too crisp! 
The huge flaky pastry had a wonderful buttery fragrance, scramble was excellent, and to top it off the generous stuffings of cheese, ham, bacon and mayo made it extra luscious. Best part is, you get all of that for S$14: tell me that isn\'t worth it. 
Lola\'s cafe is known for their honey wings. Whoever went there will know that every table will order their signature honey wings! And I have to say that it\'s really worth the hype! Their wings were juicy and crispy on the outside coated with just the right amount of honey. AMAZON JUNGLE!!! (my way of saying amazing) And their service is top notch. They have got the most friendly and approachable waiters/waitresses ever! Everyone who go there should (must) order their honey wings! Trust me you won\'t regret. 
Lola\'s is probably most known for these Honey Paprika Wings. Fried to a perfect crisp, then tossed in paprika and drizzled with honey, these chicken drumlets and wings are simple and delicious. Nothing fancy, just fried chicken done well with a good balance of flavours. I especially like how they weren\'t too oily.
2⃣ A good cup of coffee with latte art. \n<br />3⃣ Working in a cafe with great food and coffee (and preferably with a power socket and free wifi).\n<br />4⃣ Hanging out with a group of friends, catching up on one another\'s lives, over food and alcohol.\n<br />5⃣ At the same time, I enjoy shopping alone! In my own little bubble...\n<br />6⃣ Catching a really good thriller/horror/Sci-fi movie.\n<br />7⃣ Baking and attempting new recipes. \n<br />8⃣ Snuggling. Hence, the soft toys on my bed...And my human totoro. \n<br />9⃣ Making a hearty breakfast on a rainy Sunday morning, followed by a movie marathon in the afternoon. 🔟 Grocery shopping!! 😂
✔️Duck Confit $17 ✔️Nacho Cheese Fries $8 ✔️Crispy Wings $10 
The name went smthing like that! Coffee taste isnt too strong, really yummy dessert☺️
~$20! Exploding runny egg!😍 Loved the dish and the ambience! Staff are really friendly too. Rmb to make reservations to avoid disappointment!!!
I\'ve always wanted to come to Lola\'s, and I finally found the chance to. I love the ambience and atmosphere here, and I can totally see myself coming here more often. Especially since I\'m way too full from pancakes to try any of the food items, so I\'ll have to come back again to do so soon :)
The honey wings taste so yummy ! Same goes to the croissant sandwich ($13) 
Very crispy! Thought that it will be sweet and spicy but actually can\'t really taste any spiciness. Personally i do hope it has a bit more spiciness in it. On overall, it is still tasty!
Tasty... BBQ powder are sprinkled on top i think... quite a big portion for fries....
Poached eggs are nicely done. The avocado nicely reduced the citric in the hollandaise sauce which i like it that way. Instead of the traditional English muffins, crispy thick bread toast is used, it\'s nice too. Love it.
As one of their signatures, this certainly did not disappoint. The chicken was fried to perfection- the meat fell off the bones, while the skin was crispy and golden. If I had one complaint, it was that the batter was a little too thick for my liking and after a couple it was more batter than chicken. Flavour wise, the honey and paprika was a winning combo. The sweetness of the honey really complimented the smokiness and spiciness of the paprika, and brought out the savouriness of the chicken. Pretty addictive, so best to order to share in order to distribute the calories more evenly. 
Ignoring the copious amounts of butter that went into this dish, this was a winner to me. The croissant was light and fluffy inside while remaining crispy and flaky outside. The scrambled eggs were really well done. They were moist and soft, and had a really creamy texture. As if it wasn\'t rich enough, a slice of ham and bacon is tucked and hidden inside. This is brunch done well, and I can see why this is one of their more popular brunch items. The salad tasted pretty slimy though, like it had been left outside for long and was left to stew in its dressing for a while. 
Not the biggest fan of fried food (them fats!!), but I took a bite of my friend\'s fried chicken burger and was pretty impressed with what I tasted! Super crispy batter, tearing into an amazingly tender and delish chicken thigh. Plus point\'s it\'s not oily! And the fries: so addictive.
I don\'t order panna cotta often, but when I do, it\'s at Lola\'s. It\'s quite a substantial portion, more than enough to fill up the \'dessert pocket\' in my tummy. The panna cotta is firm, smooth, rich and thank God, not cloyingly sweet. However, it does get a bit too rich to handle at the halfway mark, but that\'s what the gloriously crumbly almond crumble is there for. It softens up the richness of the panna cotta and changes the game entirely! They work in perfect harmony like Bonnie and Clyde, or like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Well done Lola\'s.
My army buddies and I ordered up a Farmhouse Brats, a Breakfast Butter Croissant (BBC) and Lola\'s signature Honey Paprika Wings. The pork sausage was smoky and hit all the right savory notes while the accompanying nacho cheese sauce and purple slaw complimented the brat well. The wings were excellently executed and were as crisp as a starched army uniform even down to the last bite, which was surprising given the generous drizzle of honey, which offset the mild heat from the paprika. But the show stealer was undoubtedly the BBC. Rich butter croissant slathered with tangy Cajun mayo and stuffed with moist, velvety scrambled eggs with melted cheddar, and topped off with thick ham and honey bacon? It\'s a no contest, ladies and gentlemen! It\'s one of the best breakfasts I\'ve had in a while.
A Batavian blend of coffee beans, Lola\'s mocha is an earthy, full bodied and heavy on the palate brew. It\'s not too rich and not too bitter, possessing just enough bitterness to give you that morning perk up. It\'s also the smoothest brew I\'ve had the pleasure of enjoying so far. I can\'t decide between this one and Pacamara\'s brew though... 
Another favourite in this cafe. I love their matcha latte. Thick and milky while retaining the natural bitter aftertaste of matcha 》$5
Chicken Wings, Honey &amp; Spices 》$10
Butter Croissant, Scrambled Eggs, Pork Ham, Honey Bacons, Cheddar Cheese, Honey Mayo, Garden Salad &amp; Balsamic Dressing 》$14
Pork Sausage, Sweet Bun, Nacho Cheese Sauce, Purple Slaw &amp; Potato Fries 》$10
Pork Sausages, Mash Potatoes &amp; Sweet Onion Sauce 》$10
I am huge fan of truffle fries and this is something i was quite turn off . The truffle oil fried with the fries was strong but however it would be better if they serve the mayo and truffle oil with it . I really like the strangers reunion one !! 😊 overall i really like it 
This cost me $11 and bread was super soft and crispy in the outside ! Recommended !!
And if you go at 10am, there\'s no wait. (Which means you should definitely call in sick tomorrow so you can go 😉)
Love the Lemon tart as I hardly come across a lemon tart that is sour. It\'s not artificially sweet and the sweetness in the meringue balances the sour taste. 
The wings is really good and it has some spices with honey. Cost is about $8 
And I\'m glad I did! It was thick and creamy, and I really appreciate how the level of sweetness was just right, so I could still taste the natural bitterness of quality matcha. 
A lemon meringue tart even after a full meal but just right to go into the stomach. Taste alil more sour than sweet. Only thing I feel is the tart being abit too hard
Chicken wings and drumsticks were crispy and good. They should add more pepparika though 
Specially dropped by Lola\'s Cafe since it is so near my place just to try their Avocado Eggs Benedict. 
8 yummy wings that exceeded my expectations. The honey coated wings were not too sweet and did not override the paprika powder that was dusted on each wing.
A little too much cream for my personal liking, cake\'s on the harder and sweeter side as well. But we like the rose and lychee flavors, wish the rose flavor is a little stronger though. Would wanna try the strawberry pistachio tart at Lola\'s next. 
Relatively new addition to the menu so we decided to give it a try. Croissant was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Scrambled eggs was done just right, not too hard or runny. It was just perfect. 
THE BOMBBBB YESSS PLEASEEEE. Waited for 20 mins but it\'s all well after biting into the first wing. All the honey and paprika combination going on with perfectly crispy fried skin. Well WORTH TRY.  8/10 for the wings
Ordered duck leg confit and matcha ice latte for myself that evening at Lola\'s. Smooth mashed potatoes with dry mustard, and of course the duck leg which was rather dry sadly. Personally prefer a more salty crispy skin but very filling dish. Matcha latte really thick and flavourful to mine liking!!!!🙋🏻👍🏼                           6/10 do visit the cafe early if not there will be a queue, waiting time up to 20 mins. 
With an irresistibly flaky texture, the croissant is served with scrambled eggs, pork ham, honey bacons, cheddar cheese, cajun mayo and garden salad. The creamy eggs pairs very well with the buttery and puffy croissant. \n<br /> \n<br />Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/lolas-cafe-simon-road/
Affordable and delicious desserts! The lemon meringue is good. A good balance of sweet and sour. It has a lemon taste lingering in your mouth after every mouthful. Sea Salt chocolate tart is again not too sweet and the coffee cream will give it whole dessert a bitter taste to balance it off. I would prefer the lemon meringue when compare to the chocolate tart. But both is good. 
My more confident paper didn\'t go as well as I would like! 😢 That means I have to work even harder for the next 2! 💪 #throwbackfaraway, I really miss food hopping 😭 Exams go away!!
Chicken burger portion is really huge. It\'s indeed crispy and yet the chicken is tender. The duck confit is tender, not too dry when compared to AEIOU. Mash potato is smooth. Really enjoy the dinner. 
I had the entire plate of Honey Paprika Crispy Wings ($10) all by myself. The wings were fried to perfection, generously peppered with paprika and honey drizzled on top. I couldn’t be bothered about any image and dug it with my bare hands. It was totally worth having my fingers oiled which I get finicky about. \n<br />Full review on http://imhaydenchan.blogspot.sg/2015/04/lolas-cafe.html?m=1
($14) A great combination where each component complemented the other. The buttery smooth Croissant with the milky texture of the scrambled eggs is truly a match make. It will definitely satisfy a big appetite! 
💕 will be better if the smoked salmon is thicker! Though I probably won\'t be going back to this cafe.

Can\'t believe business at Lola\'s is so good! Was there at 3pm on a weekday and I had to wait for 15 minutes for a table.
Brunch is only till 3pm. Food is good, especially the honey wings.
Lola\'s cafe is a perfect getaway from the hoodiness of kovan food. The lychee rose water cake was light and not too sweet- perfect for an afternoon pick me up. The apple cake was a bit too sweet and cinnamon-y for my liking. Honey paprika wings are fabulous, as was the matcha latte I had- creamy with a strong matcha flavour. Will be back to try their main course dishes and brunch. It\'s a pity they are so far from me! 
Didn\'t get to try the main courses that day because I was there at teabreak timing. I ordered the sides which are available during 3-4+. The chicken wings are nicely seasoned. Very delicious !! And the cheese fries were not bad. Overall, 7/10 but recommend the wings😍
They stop serving lunch at 3 and only start dinner at 6 :-( but nonetheless their Bangers and Mash were yummy but nothing extraordinary. Their wings however, were outta this world. MUST TRY!  Total came to about $19 (best part, no GST/SC!)
Very nice and crispy chicken wings! 1 of the best I ever had! 👍
The nacho cheese fries tasted so much better than the truffles one imo! Just looking at the picture makes me drool. 😋
2.5 munchies: I thought the famed honey paprika wings were a little too salty and could have been crispier, albeit well marinated and tender. Not only the pasta dishes were a tad oily and heavy, the matcha latte was way too sweet and iced chocolate tasted powdery. Could someone enlighten me why is there always a queue outside at any point in time?
Bangers and mash, breakfast croissant and eggs Ben | A quaint little setting, comforting food and nett prices are just some things to love about Lola\'s :-) They get their brunch right with flavourful ingredients. The wings are a must-try (not pictured), and the bangers and mash are worth a go too. The breakfast croissant was satisfying, but not as amazing as I\'d expected from the hype of it.
It was light and sweet and wonderful. They only serve this on select days during the week so I was lucky enough to be there on the day they did (I went on a Friday evening)! The cake was rich, so sharing it is advised. Do give it a try, you won\'t regret it!
We ordered the duck confit, swimmer crab spaghetti &amp; of coz their delicious honey paprika crispy wings for dinner. 
Really yummy tarts at affording price of $5/pc. Definitely a must have when I\'m at Lola\'s. Also, at Lola\'s there\'s no gst and service charge! 
They changed their chairs and tables so as to accommodate more customers and they still serve decent brunch with no frills. 3/14 白色情人节快乐!
Orders: iced matcha latte , iced chai tea latte and banana w lemon meringue tart ( rough gauge names 😂) my order was the chai tea one and it tasted not suitably for me but recommended if you are a great fan of it 😊 the tart was topped up w powder n pistachios. Personally I can\'t eat bananas else I\'ll puke 😂 however the bananas in the tart was surprisingly tasty and I can\'t stop myself from gobbling it down 😅😅 the crust tasted like pineapple tarts crust in a more solid n hard form. Though the taste is rather common (for my cafe hopping tasting mood) I\'d recommend going there as It\'s super photo worthy plus It\'s wallet friendly 😂😂😄😄
fav brunch place of all time. Net price so it\'s pretty affordable. located at kovan
Full brekkie plate was alright. Honey Crispy Wings was to die for! Reminded me of home so it could pass as a comfort food for me.
☺️🍴 I love everything on this plate, except the scrambled eggs. Wish it was more creamy. On a side note, do come early to beat the queue! Early bird catches the worm ya?😊 Happy first weekend of 2015! 💖
My friends loved everything we ordered - matcha latte, sea salt chocolate tart. Still in love with their honey paprika wings. Was here before dinner time so didn\'t have to queue! 
Crispy wings coated with honey and sprinkled with a lil spicy powder! This is really DA BOMB!!! Not as if the wings are not sinful enough, we still dip the wings on the honey and were so sad (but paiseh to stop them) when they cleared it with traces of honey still there! Strongly recommended! 👍
A heap of thick crispy fries with super cheesy sauce and a hint of spice. Full of sinful goodness!
Fresh, crisp and hot. Would actually have preferred it to be a tad less crisp cause I love fries that are fluffy on the inside. The aroma of truffle could be stronger, and more Parmesan shavings please!
I loved these wings! Super light and crispy battered wings that are tender and juicy inside, well seasoned with a savoury sweet marinade.
A generous spread of typical breakfast items at only $15 nett. Scrambled eggs were very creamy and buttery, but a little heavy for me. The sausage was huge and tender. I didn\'t really like the bacon here cause I like my bacon crisper but this was the chewy sort and was sweet (like a fattier version of bak kwa), so to each his own!
Although it was a little hard and difficult to cut, I love the taste of earl grey and the caramelised pieces.
$10 a serving and served on a wooden chopping board. Very crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Tastes spicy and sweet in same mouthful.
$5 a piece. Earl grey pastry cream, caramelized banana, pistachio crumble. The creamy filling tastes thick and flowery. Disappointed by its very hard crust base.
Cheesiest cheese fries. Scrambled egg with nicely toasted croissant and egg Benny! Nothing disappointing and worth the wait. Try going on a weekday to avoid the queue 
Awesome wings!
Honey paprika wings were crispy on the outside and tender inside. Bangers &amp; Mash is a must to order as taste were really nice!!  Love the Brownie with Icecream which the sweetness &amp; portion were just right. Will definitely visit again!
This 40-seater cafe is rather small but pretty cosy. we waited 45\'mins and there are still people in the waiting list. Now it\'s time for dinner! 😋 We are having the mushroom and bacon spaghetti, the crispy chicken wings and nacho cheese fries.
some mushrooms and cheese in de hole to rid the couple bottles of wines, cocktails and beer. who\'s uppa?
Their full monty breakfast is filled with toast, scrambled, bacon, pork sausage and a garden salad. Their scrambled egg is good! It’s a lil runny and fluffy! Its good to eat the bacon and sausage with toast or salad if not it may be a lil too salty if eaten too much on its own.
I should\'ve checked beforehand that brunch ends at 3, so I didn\'t get to try any of that. Luckily they still had desserts and starters available, so I had the seasalt chocolate tart with coffee cream and the popular honey paprika wings. Chocolate filling in the tart was smooth, rich and paired well with the coffee cream, but I was a bit disappointed that the seasalt was merely sprinkled on. Wings were crispy and easy to eat as the meat was well cooked and came off the bone easily. Spices were a little bit too strong/salty and I wished there was more honey drizzled. Place was a bit smaller than expected and a bit too noisy for chilling alone. But I wouldn\'t mind coming back to try brunch one day!
👫 Appreciate times like this when we\'ll put aside our work and spend some quality time together. 💕 \'it\'s not about quantity, it\'s about quality\'. Have a great Sunday too, everyone!☺️
Probably the only thing that is worth the try in Lola\'s cafe. 
nothing special imo. what\'s all this hype and waiting for two hours all about ? \n<br />nevertheless, something different for this blue Monday
🙋🙋🙋 average. the croissant was quite disappointing though. delifrance makes it better 😬😬
Though it is kind of expensive, but its worth the money as it came in a big plate and not to mention the cheese too! Cheese lovers will love it!
These wings were amazing. Served piping hot and drizzled with honey, it was crispy yet so juicy! 
A generous portion for $15 nett! I was quite filled up just half way through the dish. I liked the unique flavour the avocado spread added to the overall dish. Yum! 
Fluffy scrambled eggs, honey baked ham, bacon, cheddar cheese, garden salad with balsamic dressing - all in one butter croissant. What more can you ask for!
Fresh Lemon Curd, Meringue, Candied Lemon Zest.
Cream Cheese Frosting, Chunks of Pineapples, Banana and Dash of Cinnamon.
Yes, these fries looked good, golden and crispy. No, there are not up to our likings. They looked good but does not taste good to us. The fries are too HARD. I have never eaten such hard/crispy fries till we feel so tired eating it. Just imagine that you are eating biscuits instead of fries. We end up leaving 3/4 of the fries on the table when we left 》$12
Brioche Bread, Avocado, Poached Eggs, Pork Ham, Hollandaise Sauce, Garden Salad and Balsamic Dressing.
Brioche Bread, Pork Sausages, Honey Bacons, Pork Ham, Scrambled Eggs, Garden Salad, Balsamic Dressing.
Paprika wings are awesome -$10 only for 8 wings. Cheesy fries and carbonara was good too. You should try the duck dish. Its very tasty. The place is always crowded and long queue hence you should reach before 6pm for dinner. They don\'t charge service charge and GST, hence its very affordable. 
Very small but cozy. Just come in twos n not in groups for easier sitting!
Ordered some coffee as well as the classic french vanilla creme brulee, dark chocolate sea salt tart with kahlua coffee cream and sticky honey apple cake with french vanilla ice cream. Really loved the mocha, Lola\'s uses extra dark chocolate for it, and with an extra shot added, I totally sold my coffee-drinking soul! Totally worth the long wait 😉
Bangers and mash, eggs Ben with avocado, croissant with scrambled eggs.  MAJOR LOVE the bangers and mash and the croissant. I don\'t really like the Eggs Benedict 😭😩 So gelak... 😰
Earl grey is strong and the banana add to more favour to the tart .
Can\'t remember the exact dish name, but the croissant dish and the mushroom bread dish (sorry can\'t really be of help since I last went EONS ago) as well as the truffle fries (really love my truffle fries 🍟) my friends and I ordered to share together was SO AMAZING, we made a second trip back to order their famous wings which was finger licking good 👌👌
Before going to this cafe, please do call for reservations first. We had to wait for like more than 40 mins just for a sit. And also please dont just join in the queue, submit your name and number to the girl handling the queue and reservations. But the wait was worth it thanks to the muscle eye candies working there and the real desserts and dinner! We ordered the chicken paprika for our starters and it literally blew us away. Wanted to order to bring home but we were too full by the end of the dinner. Had fish burger, the burger bun was delish( hahaha yes, for real, i eat the bun first then the fish) the fish patty was just an okay okay. It wasnt really satisfying but the sauce that really saved the fish. Our desserts was lemon meringue, chocolate tart and panna cotta. The lemon meringue was a so so and abit too sour(i\'d go for the FBB\'s lemon tart than this) but the chocolate tart was really thick and chocolatey. So sinfullll. And the panna cotta was so cuteee. Best eaten with the hazelnut brittles. Must trys are the chicken paprika, panna cotta, chicken burger &amp; the babycinno(served in a small bottle of cuteness! 😍😍)
Had brunch at Lola\'s, their bangers and mash is decent but quite regretted not trying the brunch sets and wings they are famous for as they can\'t really go wrong with sausages and mashed potatoes anyway. Definitely will come back again and find out if they are really as good as people rave about!
Wasn\'t impressed with the presentation but the taste was really good, awesome sausage and nacho cheese sauce. Fries were freshly fried.
Love the hollandaise sauce! Very unique flavor, and love the touch of herbs and chilli powder on top. Eggs were done really well.
Great lemon tart with just nice texture. If you notice, there are some lemon zest on top of the tart. Taste good.
Poached with avocado and ham, good but the brioche can be better
Their wings are surprisingly good. 🍗 will go back again for this!
Only tried their starters as I went around 4pm + 
So we tried the honey and paprika crispy wings, truffle fries, as well as the bacon and mushroom spaghetti in truffle cream sauce for 2 and it was overfilling. I would just say the food is so so, and the truffle fries are way too salty.
A warm cup of sweetness while you chat away with your friend...
Lola\'s brunch is better than dinner imo, but these wings are really good! 
The texture of the matcha latte was slightly too powdery, but the matcha and milk taste was well balanced. The iced latte had a nice thickness to it too. 
The eggs were really well cooked! The yolk was runny enough and moistened the bread just right. They were very generous with the hollandaise sauce as well. Rich in flavor! 
The pastry was overall very sweet to me. Nevertheless I enjoyed the crunchy tart base and the strong earl grey taste (though my friend felt it was too strong). 
A calming environment with the perfect mix of vintage and industrial, Lola\'s is a great spot for a casual brunch. Their honey paprika wings are a hit, along with their trusty eggs ben. Pick a nice cider from their wide selection to go with your wings, and kick back for a relaxing weekend.
On a whole, it\'s really great and filling though it looks rather small in portion. I really like the scramble egg and the honey bacon. $15 for this is a great deal :) 
LOVED THIS. I usually avoid finishing desserts at one go but this was an exception. Rich chocolatey, slight saltiness, not sweet at all (&amp; not gelat hehe)
$10. Cheese, mushroom, soft fluffy thick toast!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unpretentious goodness, really liked this.
$15 - gorgeous perfectly poached egg!
$15, bacon was good!!! Portion looked small but it was quite filling. Satisfying brunch.
Truffle fries (if you like \'em with loads of Parmesan) / braised pork goulash stew served with baguette / coastal seafood spaghetti (tomato base). Good place if you don\'t mind the long waiting time and tiny space. 
Lola\'s needs no introduction and I was here because I had it down on my wishlist. I really like its location - a little out of the way from where I live and nestled in a neighbourhood with a somewhat laid-back feel (of course, we\'re hardly laid-back in sg). We were here twice - the first time missing brunch by a mere 3 minutes and thus settled for sides which included truffle fries and bangers and mash. On the second visit, we ordered these crispy wings and they were delicious. However, whilst eating I recalled a similar taste to that of CP\'s very own crispy wings and was a little skeptical about these wings being actually marinated/seasoned in their own kitchen. Eventually, I was so convinced these were really CP wings I felt a little disappointed for having returned, only to be served something which I could get from the supermarket. That being said, IF these were really prepared from scratch in their kitchen, I\'d be really surprised they managed to recreate the taste of CP\'s wings but I also wonder if I\'d appreciate that. As you can already tell, I\'m really undecided as to whether or not I liked this ::/
The saving grace in this dish was the combination of mash potato and honey mustard sauce (which goes well with most things). And after having those thoughts about the wings I began to feel as though most of the food here had been pre-made (they started tasting like it) and simply put together in their kitchen. Okay I mean to give them the benefit of doubt, surely they prepared the duck leg, which ended up being overcooked and stiff. I\'m very unforgiving in my thoughts about this place I know! I probably stand corrected though, since it\'s really just my opinion!
Okayyyy, so above everything I\'ve said about the food at Lola\'s.... The food here really isn\'t bad, and the same goes for this swimmer crab spaghetti (canned crab? Hahaha) Almost everything we ordered was very easy to like because it was tasty and eating here just felt... Easy. Haha, I don\'t want to decide just yet if I like this place or not because at Lola\'s, prices are affordable, food doesn\'t taste bad even if they feel premade. I think I\'ve said it all. I would like to have brunch here one day, because I\'m all up for good, delicious brunch. I just really hope that this niggling feeling about how the food is prepared will go away... Or be forgotten. But if there\'s one thing I learnt from school, it is, \"what you see you cannot unsee\" and I guess set in this context it means I won\'t be able to forget how I felt about the food here that easily, as much as I want to like it very much ::( 
Chai latte, cafe latte, lemon meringue tart, chocolate salted caramel tart, sticky date cake
Priced at $5. Yummy but could do without the sea salt. Chocolate wasn\'t too sweet and the tart was good. Not too hard/crumbly. The cream was the highlight!
Oh best wings ever, I see this dish on every patron\' s table at Lola\'s and I could understand why. It\'s a must try! Priced at $10 for 8 pieces. It was crispy on the outside and tender inside without being too oily. It was juicy and addictive. The honey and paprika complimented the wings really well. 
Priced at $5.50. very chocolatey!
Fell in love with their chocolate tart and went a little more adventurous. However the texture of this differs from the chocolate tart. Not sure if it was inconsistent or what, the tart was really tough, couldn\'t even fork it down. Personally find the taste of earl grey too overpowering. No banana flavoring in the filling, just slices layered on top of the tart with pistachio crumble. While the bf think overall it tasted fine, I didn\'t enjoy it. On a side note, I love their latte! 
Everything on this plate, from the brioche bread, honey bacon to scrambled eggs was excellent! $15, was worth the one hour wait for a table.
$10. Just the right crispness, meat fresh and easy to eat with tasty sauce accompanying each portion. Good!
Brioche bread topped with avocado, pork ham, poached eggs and drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Garden salad with balsamic dressing on the side. 
Brioche bread, pork sausage, honey bacons, pork ham, scrambled eggs and garden salad with balsamic dressing on the side.
Nothing much to complain about this cafe, except for its long waiting time and no reservation is allowed. The signature avocado eggs Benedict ($15) was my favorite and not forgetting their full Monty big breakfast ($15) unfortunately I\'m not a coffee lover but totally loving the iced latte here!
Had the vanilla crème brûlée which had a crispy caramel top which wasn\'t too sweet. The vanilla and milk was light on the palate, making it an enjoyable dessert. The salted chocolate tart wasn\'t too bad either; the tart was sturdy and not crumbly, the chocolate wasn\'t too sweet with the salt to complement the stickiness of chocolate. The coffee cream was disappointing. It was too light and didn\'t bring much to the dish. I was initially attracted by the addition of Bailey but sadly, the alcohol didn\'t come through at all. 
Nothing special. The tomato base was thankfully not too spicy. Crabmeat was mixed with the sauce that had a strong basil taste but this would probably be what you get for $15. 
Extremely long waiting time. The sea salt chocolate tart was good. 
The sauce was really garlicky, perhaps only with a tint of anchovies. The shrimps, squid, and mussels were under seasoned. They were too bland but at least were quite fresh. Okay for $14! 
One of the best brunch place that I\'ve ever been! I seriously can\'t get enough of their croissant, it\'s just so nice.. And don\'t forget to order the honey chicken wing too! Definitely worth the money &amp; I know I\'ll go back soon :-)
My fifth time at this place, my first for its brunch and I would say the price is good for such a dish. The eggs were runny and the sauces weren\'t too strong for an overkill, the avocado when eaten with ham gives a taste so satisfying that sends you going for another bite of it. The salad was pretty decent and the entire dish was sufficient to make one feel full!

Every cafe bounds to have a meringue of sorts &amp; Lola\'s lemon meringue really hits the spot! Topped with not-so-sweet meringue &amp; orange peel, it\'s a good combination! 
Caramelized bananas are super super good &amp; the earl grey taste isn\'t an overkill, so 👍👍. 
The brunch menu was limited however the food was reasonably priced. The full monthy breakfast had a little bit of everything and made the dish well balanced. The dish included a jumbo sausage, cheese scrambled eggs, salad drizzled with balsamic vinegar, a few pieces of ham that were sweet and salty and a toast   
Really liked how the sweetness of the honey and the smokiness of the paprika paired with the crispy and juicy fried wings. Definitely deserves a revisit!
Popped by Lola\'s the other day cause I was craving for crispy wings so bad. Had to settle for cheese fries because they ran out of it. But I\'m still craving for my crispy wingggggs!  #slaveofmytummy
The pastas were cooked to my liking. Portion was also relatively sufficient given that I didn\'t had much appetite that day. Definitely worth all the waiting time and all! Ordered here are the Bacon and Mushroom spaghetti in truffle cream sauce / Swimmer crab spaghetti in spicy tomato cream sauce pricing at SGD14 and SGD15 respectively. Good dinner I had! 😋
Duck leg confit with honey mustard sauce. Served with aragula and mashed potatoes. $15
Swimmer crabmeat spaghetti with spicy tomato cream sauce. Served with basil. $16
Brunch at #LolaCafe simon road. For a cafe I am quite impressed with the food offering and coffee. Definitely the better one around.
This backyard cafe is really worth the journey to the North! Need to come back for the brunch and dinner menu!
last hop of the day! =) Creative serving of the matcha latte ~
Venturing to Kovan just for this! My first time in this area and everything looks so foreign #obviouslynotanadventurer
This is not the regular Green Tea Latte from Starbucks, but still a good drink and always taste better especially in a jar.
Finally we are here!! My queen been wanting to visit this cafe for weeks 😘😜❤️ #lolacafe #burpple
Sea-salt chocolate tart with coffee cream ($5.00) The dark chocolate ganache was thick and I really love this!
Went to lola\'s cafe to celebrate my bf and I\'s anniversary and the food was not bad! The mushroom and cheese sandwich was good and filling, same goes to the avocado egg benedicts. However you might get sick of it after awhile so I advise sharing. The honey and paprika crisp wings were the best! Really unique taste to it, its a must try. Tried the hot chocolate, interesting way of filling into like a mini milk bottle. My bf had iced latte and I could taste and smell the aroma of the coffee beans. Great place, will be back again. :)
Okay I forgot the exact name of the pasta but it was nice and creamy we liked it :) let\'s make this place our cafe ^^
Totally loved this place. And the truffle fries were amazing too!
Finally tried their legendary chicken wings! Really succulent and definitely live up to its name! Nachos cheese fries and lemon meringue tart was equally fantastic! Love this place...relaxing and cosy! And best of all, it\'s so near my house! 😄😄😄
brownie with vanilla icecream. i promise the icecream isn\'t that huge irl, it\'s just the angle. #desserts #foodporn #latergram
So here goes #burpple the standard BACON &amp; MUSHROOM spag.
Seafood is fresh, spaghetti is well cook. Chef is very generous with the ingredient despite the cheap price of $14 nett. 
Rich in flavour, herbs and spices taste good together. Pork is tender and soft, very flavorful. Bread that comes with it is crispy, goes well with the sauce. 
This was so good and satisfying! Love the generous serving of hollandaise sauce! The soft and creamy avocado slices went pretty well with the eggs benedict! :)
portion was a bit smaller as compared to other full breakfast platters we have had! But this was only $15 nett, oh well!
but they looked essentially the same so I\'m just gonna post one of them here. Hahaha!
A cafe that put your patience to test. Wait for a seat. Wait for coffee. Wait for food. Wait for payment. But despite all these waiting, I must say that the food is worth the wait. Not the coffee, but the food. Nice environment to chill with your loved ones. Perfect place to go in the neighborhood when you have no plans in the day. 
My simple serving of carbs after the race! A mushroom and cheese toast ($10)! Yummy yummy! The mushrooms were juicy and nice, with a generous serving of cheese on toasted bread! The brunch menu at Lola\'s are pretty limited though, I\'d very much love to try their dinner menu which looks AMAZING!

Earl grey cream was quite refreshing, and tart still tasted fresh. But I would have liked the pastry to be more flavoured. 3.5/5
The best dish of Lola\'s, and one I would come back for: the honey paprika wings. Not too oily, well-flavoured. The Fish &amp; Chips was disappointing to me though, as opposed to its glowing reviews. Didn\'t quite like the batter, and its consistency was such that it broke into pieces every time I tried to slice it. 
My friend ordered this since it was one of the better-recommended dishes here. Presentation was disappointing to be honest, but it was flavourful. Would have preferred it to be softer, but I guess that\'s why it\'s not duck confit. Overall 6.5/10
This is a must-order dish! The honey and paprika goes really well together and I always have to order this when I come.
This full Monty breakfast has everything that you require to power up your day! This has me coming back to Lola\'s everytime when I feel like having brunch :)
If you love dark choco and love the combi of salty n sweet taste, u may consider this ;) 
Brunch earlier on, off to the cafe opened by K\'s friend. They were talking &amp; catching up while I try to put my name in the cool queuing system. Every cafe should adopt this! They have a iPad outside the cafe, so u choose the number of pax, input your name &amp; contact number and your preferred seats(indoor/outdoor), then it gives u a Q number. Straight away a SMS was sent to inform u of your Q number. When your table is available, you will receive an automated call, it will tell u that your table is ready and press \'1\' if you are at the cafe, \'2\' if you are 5 mins away etc. Fuss free and cool! I love it here!

Missed their brunch hours. 
Halibut fish and chip is moist enough. Seasoning of fries was really good except for the cheese fries\' cheese which was pretty blend. Drinks were really really good cause I love matcha! Chicken wing was so tasty I\'m so hungry everytime I look at it! Haven\'t tried their spaghetti but my friend loved it!! Pretty good atmosphere, good service and really cute chairs outside!
This was surprisingly yummy though I think it could do with less raspberry and more mousse - must try!
Tomato cream spicy crab pasta #burpple
An awesome twist to the regular fried wings.. A drizzle of honey and a sprinkle of paprika makes it so yummy. I\'ll definitely come back for this.
brunch looks perfect. 😍 and on a side note, my 1000th photo is a food photo! hahaha what\'s new right. #saturdays #brunch
Lemon meringue for $4 and Nutella oreo based tart for $7 
not as exciting as it sounds
Hmm, I\'ve tasted better. Tart crust was a little too thick for my liking. 
😍Sesame matcha tart- refreshing and good mix of sesame and matcha, melts in the mouth when served cold! 👍🏻😋\n<br />-\n<br />#singapore #igsg #sgig #lifestyle  #instagood #sgfoodie #explore #instadaily #instafood #foodporn #foodgasm #travel #exploresg #travelgram #bbctravel #localfood #onthetable #sgeats  #eathealthy #burpple  #sgcafe #sgcafehop #coffee #8dayseat #sgdessert #tart #matcha

Our Must Have. Everyone\'s Popular Choice. One word: SHIOK!\n<br />🍯
Brioche Bun so fluffy yet crispy on the surface! Taste was just so superb with homemade BBQ sauce, cheddar, pinion ring &amp; sunny side egg! YUM!\n<br />🍔
Didn\'t really enjoy the sourlish taste...is it suppose to be sour 🤔\n<br />🍄
I heard from my friends that lola\'s cafe is an awesome place to visit for brunch. So, i headed down to check it out myself. The place is quite a small place, so if you would want a good seat you would have to wait or come down early. The ambiance of the place feels very hip and pop, very suitable for dates. We ordered their famous ultimate croissant, lola\'s full work and honey paprika crispy wings. The wings were very nice and packed with flavours, they were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and they were cooked to perfection. As for the croissant, it was well baked, the egg was well seasoned, and the ham smoked nicely. Although the egg is nice, but it was a bit too oily for my liking. As for lola\'s full work, what you see is what you get. The bread was toasted nicely, the ham was the same as the croissant, the sausage was very nice, it has a lot of flavour in the stuffing. As for the egg that came with it, it was just a bit too oily as well and the white sause that came with it was a bit too strong till it broke the egg\'s taste. Overall i think the wings were good and the rest were just decent.
Adequate portions of salmon and avocado so im not complaining! #sgfoodies #yummy #cafe #sgcafehopping #healthy #salads #tbt #burpple #sgmakandiaries
This needs no explanation. ORDER IT !
Paprika and cheese, never knew there could be such a heavenly pairing.

anyway the meat is tender and no porky smell.. it\'s tasty, smoky and sort of have a hint of sweetness like something from a bbq sauce. It\'s not the most juicy or succulent but it\'s enjoyable..The buns, cheese and purple slaw really complimented it well... I would say I\'ll be back to try their other items!👌🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#lolacafesg#lolacafe#pullpork#burger#pullporkburger#cafesg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
It\'s abit too wet for my liking and the truffle is rather mild. But what they lack was certainly made up  by their taste. I\'m surprise the bacon did add some nice salty overtones and also assisted the chewy texture to the mushrooms. The cream is tasty too and definitely not too jelak. I would say it\'s pretty enjoyable!👍🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#lolacafe#italianfood#lolacafesg#pasta#spegetti#cafesg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Sunday brunch affair.\n<br />Smoked pulled pork sanger/truffle fries /crispy wings \n<br />Loved the smokiness of the pulled pork and soft  brioche bread. Fries is pretty normal and their wings didn\'t disappointed us too.
Better still if there\'s my favourite swan on my cuppa. 😍😍😍 Handmodel @emily_toh
Truffle taste was not strong. Big portion however.

A satisfying lemon meringue tart is always hard to come by and I was so pleased that the one @lolascafesg did not disappoint me!
Throwback to this scrambled egg croissant at THE Lola\'s Cafe which my bro @junkieong declared to be the BEST brunch spot. I can smell the croissant now while I\'m typing 😱 Side note, lotsa cafes including Lola\'s are NOT opened on Mondays, so always check before going!\n<br />•\n<br />#whati8today #exploresingapore #foodiesg #8dayseat #sgfoodie #iweeklyfood #foodstagram #foodporn #burpple #lolascafe #brunch #brunchsg #hungrygowhere #croissant #egg

Well toasted buttery croissant that breaks into flakes upon impact. Once through, a generous serving of scrambled eggs awaits.

Hers: Avacado Eggs Benedict ($14), Flat White ($5)\n<br />His: Lola\'s Full Works ($17), Cappuccino ($5)
But my mum wanted to try something different. She has an adventurous palate for a senior citizen! So here we are, Atlantic salmon egg benedict. One of the better poached eggs I had - deep orange in colour, wet but still sticky. Brioche was butter toasted but still very soft. Unlike other cafes which were really noisy, Lola\'s allows you to have a decent conversation without having to shout at one another, even though there were queues early morning. Will be back to try other items :) #sgcafehopping #cafehoppingsg #eggsbenedict #STFoodtrending

2.5 munchies: With Debbie looking topsy-turvy like this, it was no surprise that the combination of peanut caramel ice cream, black cookie crush, sautéed banana, and peanut brittle cloyed quickly for me. Kids and those with a sweet tooth would appreciate this new item at the recently expanded Lola\'s, though.
So, decided to try something different &amp; had the Odd Fellow (Passionfruit curd, Basil ice cream, Cereal crumbs, meringue brittles).

Honey Paprika Crispy Wings ($10) and Avocado Eggs Benedict ($15) for Lola\'s Brunch Menu from 10am to 3pm. Their desserts are really good too! Do make a reservation or call before heading down to check for space! 
Must order wings
A really impromptus one. 😅
Finally tried Lola\'s cafe today!! I had the chili crab pasta while my friends had the fried chicken and fish burger. If you\'re in a dilemma of choosing, I\'d recommend you to go for the fried chicken burger! It\'s really so good!! Oh yes, and not forgetting the wings, which was the highlight of our dinner. It\'s crispy and has a tinge of sweetness! Really good!! Pity we didn\'t have any more room for desserts but they looked so good:( oh well I\'ll be back☺️☺️
Everything is good. 😌

Atlantic Benedict with a Bratwurst on the side and washed down with an Iced Cappuccino. Pretty good - the poached eggs were nicely done and I like the brioche bread and the succulent bratwurst.

Good coffee. Right temperature and good, full body. Distinct taste of both chocolate and coffee. Additional shot is too much for me but X loves it.
Love the crispy cheese and brioche combination.
Sunday\'s sweets - a Nutella Chocolate Tart from Lola\'s.

Reasonably priced too 👍\n<br />Sea Salt Chocolate Ganache Tart &amp; Sticky Honey Apple Cake to end my \"Friday\" 😋\n<br />#burpple #desserts #foodporn #chocolate #fatdieme \n<br />@lilianho85  you will like this cafe 😉

Great afternoon munches at awesome prices, GST exclusive. The place is almost always packed though, reservations in advance would definietly make the visit a better one
That doesn\'t stop me from lazing my Sunday. #lolacafe #sunday #cafe #relaxonecorner

In love with the truffle fries and honey paprika wings 😍 
Chocolate tart
The wings are good 🍗 So was my Avocado Egg Benedict.
Late night desserts with @jumboyw ^.^
Cheese is soft and not sticky, nice mix with mushroom
Looks spicy but not. Must try
Value for money. All of these only costs around 100++
Good coffee!
Decent food at a quaint cafe.
Sundays are meant for brunch.
Juicy and sweet honey taste 
Definitely coming back for you

Hazenut Chocolate Praline: Sinful Dessert Delight Im having almost taste like Taste Au Chocolat.

Perfect Egg Benedict that oozes running egg yolk. This made me go awwww :)) #sunday #bruch #cafe #egg #benedict #avocado #honey #ham #danieleats #foodie #foodporn #sgfood
Need I say more? Avocado Egg Benedict #foodporn #foodie #brunch #cafe #delish #danieleats #egg #benedict #avocado #sgfood
Pretty average coffee, but lemon meringue tart is the star. Prefer Loysel\'s Toy lemon filling, but the tart here gives me a hard time deciding which is better. But after 2 failed attempt at creating one, this is definitely awesome. Coffee, dessert, papers, jazz music. What more can I ask to end this long weekend. Feeling recharged :) #cafe #lemon #meringue #tart #awesome #afternoon #sunday #chill #longweekend #cafe #singapore #sgfood #foodie #dessert #cheers #lifeisgood
The mandatory chill shot. I was so excited when I found out that there is a cafe in Kovan just when I was contemplating to go to east coast to have a cup of coffee. This cafe is pretty authentic and not overly pretentious in its decor. Am already a fan #chill #cafe #lemon #meringue #flat #white #kovan #singapore #hipster #danieleats
Avocado adds a nice twist to eggs benedict
Lousy
Wasabi White Chocolate Mousse.
What better way to spend the lazy afternoon than a cup of warm latte?
Trying out different angles 
Coffee stop on the way home
