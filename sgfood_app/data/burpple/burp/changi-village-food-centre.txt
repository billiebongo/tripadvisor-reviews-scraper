Whenever I am at a hawker centre, my eyes tend to rove around (kind of like a straight guy in a club filled with hot girls 😂) to see what others are eating. If a dish looks especially good, I\'ll ask which stall did they get it from. That\'s how I found this \"Satay Beehoon\" at Changi Village Hawker Centre. It has a thick and slightly coarse gravy with a strong coriander aroma, which makes it more interesting than a lot of the one-dimensional versions out there. The \"tau pok\" was a little dry but everything else - the cockles, sliced pork, cuttlefish, \"beehoon\" etc., were fine.\n<br />I can\'t recall the unit number but it\'s a corner stall facing the sea and they also have \"Jui Her Eng Chye\" on their menu.
Came to know of red tea jelly from Changi Village Hawker Centre, and yet it remains to be the best after scouting around for substitutes!\n<br />#BurppleCheapNGood
Seafood white beehoon seems to riding on the wave here in our food courts and hawker centers but not that I mind because I really love these crustacean soupy noodles! At changi village, Woon Woon Pek Bee Hoon\'s version is a watery version loaded with prawns, clams and sliced fish and this size is good for sharing amongst 4! Take it to the next level with the pork lard and some fiery kick from the chilli padi. The owner shared that no MSG is added, just pure seafood is used to create this broth - which I thought can be a lot more flavorful! 
I like to eat Wanton Noodles with Pork Liver. Do you? 😋😋
Look at this glorious mount of Hainanese curry rice — stewed cabbage with fermented bean curd that is so soft it melts in your mouth, braised tau kee with such a beautiful meaty bite, crispy pork chop with an addicting crust that reveals a juicy inside when bitten into, long bean omelette, and steamed minced pork ball stuffed with salted egg that is totes out of this world + curry gravy and lor gravy — and drool. My best bitch and I endearingly call this a plate of brown. Ok, that\'s all.

This Stall Serve 2 type of Stir Fried Fish Head Sambal &amp; Black Bean . One Thing Special Abt The Stir Fried Fish head the stall owner added bitterguords. One Bad Thing is that The stall Owner Dun allow his customer to choose Either Sambal or \n<br />Black Bean Fish Head. He say There is one wok at his stall. U can Queue Up 1st to see if he cooked which one 1st. He Uses Fresh Fish Head which he always get frm the wet market. Sambal Fish Head got a fragrance which i like is that the stall owner added 花调酒.

finally had the time to come here for their yummy coconut rice. chicken could be better though. nonetheless still a very foodfilling time in the east.
Definitely not Taiwan standard, but it\'s sure a good enough substitute in Singapore. While I wished the broth to be richer, it was saved by the numerous melt-in-the-mouth beef cubes. Cooked medium well, the insides are slightly pinkish and texture is tender. Definitely the best dish served by this store!
Finally tried the beehoon version of the famous fish soup at Changi Village, Guang Xing Original Taste Fish Head Beehoon, and verdict is..... Go with the fish soup and add rice on the side. 
At the famous ipoh hor fun store, decided to try this out. Its quite a nice dish. The chicken is nice, the sauce is not that thick and the noodles is not bad. Overall an enjoyable dish for $3.50 (if I remember correctly..). Just that the location is a bit inconvenient
Possibly one of the best fish soup I\'ve had. \n<br />#burpple
The other picture probably didn\'t do this bowl of yumminess any favour. Here\'s a closeup of the savoury goodness, boasting thick cuts of fresh sliced fish, a rich fish head base (with hints of XO), traces of lard and a generous serving of vegetables. And not forgetting the unique chilli mix on the side, with chilli padi, belachan chilli (I think) and soya sauce. This bowl of soup is so good, I\'d Dabao my remaining soup home if I could! 
Nasi Lemak with Begedil (S$4.00) from International Muslim Food Stall.  Late dinner at one of my favourite hawker centres.  A really satisfying and shiok meal! (Date: 17 September 2015 Thursday)
These heavenly morsels of flavourful meat on sticks from Soon Lee Heng Satay were snapped up by my family in less than five minutes and I had to order another ten sticks again.  That\'s how much we love eating the Satay from this stall. 😊😀😍
Quadruple happiness!  I am in a state of euphoria every time I bite into these succulent and addictive BBQ Chicken Wings from Soon Lee Heng Satay. 😍😍😍
Hello weekends! It\'s almost lunchtime and I\'m so craving for my bowl of Beef Noodles from Changi V. Think thick, consistent, beefy gravy, slippery smooth Kway teow, and tender beef slices. AND A SUPER AWESOME SPICY-SOUR CHILLI SAUCE ON THE SIDE! $4 for such a huge bowl and even though it\'s mighty tasty, I couldn\'t finish it on my own. 
The sauce and chilli went well with smooth and silky hor fun (slurps!). The chicken is tasty and tender and not oily. Also had other dishes such as mutton mixed soup and red tea longan. A simple, hearty meal indeed :3 #hawkerpedia #sg50
🇸🇬 Oyster Omelette, Hokkien Prawn Mee &amp; Satay plus ketupat (Malay rice dumpling) ☺️
Hate the fact that I have to use plastic fork and spoon to eat and also this is my 383747594 number of of fork and spoon.
[Changi Village Hawker Centre] Chicken skewers with peanut sauce aka satay is always a must-order especially when you are at a hawker centre with a group. After seeing the long queue at Chong Pang Soon Lee Heng Satay, we decided to find out what\'s the buzz about and ordered 10 sticks of chicken satay ($0.60 per stick) to share. After the tenth stick, we were asking for more. The peanut sauce and marinated chicken tenders are a winner.
[Changi Village Hawker Centre] This has always been one of my must-order items at a food centre and it came with little surprise that I just had to try the Changi Village Fried Hokkien Mee ($4). Many places have stopped using pork belly and lard in the frying process, hence the flavour is no longer there. Fortunately, this stall still uses these ingredients and their hokkien mee belongs to the \"mild-wet\" category which you will slurp finish the noodles in no time. What I like about this plate of noodles is the wok hei and fragrance of the fried egg.
The price is $3.50 &amp; the quantity is a lot 👍 the uncle was nice to give a lot of fried chicken. 🙆 
A hearty bowl of mutton soup ($4) for lunch. The soup was rich, peppery with a nice taste of Chinese herbs. Meat was tender. What spoilt the meal for me was the accompanying bowl of rice! It was very low quality grains that resulted in mushy rice. Definitely made the meal much less satisfying that it was supposed to be! 
I have been craving for this kind of traditional hainanese curry rice for a while! It\'s becoming rare but I found one here at Changi Village! Not too bad and the thick curry sauce is delicious! 
Actually prefer this minced meat/fishball noodles stall over the famous Ipoh hor fun (if I\'m looking for a noodle fix) because of how meticulous the stall owner is in preparing each dish and the unpretentious ingredients used! The Ipoh hor fun here, although tasty, left me gulping cups of water after but not for the minced meat noodles here! Having mee sua for minced meat noodles might not seat well with many so I suggest going for the normal mee pok/ Kway teow!! 
Thought I still prefer international\'s chilli but I have to agree that mizzy\'s rice smell and taste so much better than international. Well, personal preference I guess. How about you? Let me know your take on both the nasi lemak stalls.
Craving for beef noodle saw this stall selling beef noodle so join the  line when see people queuing for it. Tried the dry version of thick mee fen and thinking it could better or at least same as the one at bishan foodcourt. To my dismay it totally can\'t make it. The sauce and the noodle totally can\'t make it , the saving grace it is only the beef slices. 
For only $3.50 this plate of chicken chop noodles packs a punch. Highly recommend this place for those who have been outta town for awhile and can\'t decide where to start to satisfy your local food fare deprivations! \n<br />這是我每來到樟宜美食中心必點的雞扒麵！雞扒香脆可口，麵條非常有彈性！昇宗推薦！
Small size steamed Flower crab. Light sweet taste of the sea. Nice! 
Changi V. Dessert House. Generous portion of the dessert. It\'s really nice too! Worth it especially on the hot days! :)
Very nice fried fish head and fish soup and fish soup bee hoon
chicken hor fun with fried wantons. seems like standards have dropped but still good to come back here. it\'s been quite awhile
One of the best prawn noodle in changi village. The soup was good and the meat and prawn was given in a good quantity. Not halal btw sorry
Only S$2 a bowl! Rose Jelly with Lychee!
@dailyfamousfoodies
Fish set add chicken. The rice is fragrant. Think this taste nicer than missy and the ikan bilis are nicer too. Chicken is so so only. Chilli is really sweet and has onions. Unfortunately onions not my thang. 
Worth it?
Tried this after coming back from Bintan. And I must say, the portion is super generous and is tasty too!
Since come all the way here, how can I don\'t eat this!!
Xiang Xiang is the name of this awesome Hokkien Mee stall. For only $3.50 you get noodles that is wet with gravy but not too wet. And chilli is just spicy enough and doesn\'t overpower the flavour of the noodles. Just awesome!
Changing V BBQ house. Subject to availability. 3 for $10. Local sea catch. Hahaha!
Steam flower crabs, 3 for $10 is my new favorite must eat when I\'m here now. It\'s highly subject to availability!
Comes with a big drumstick. $3.50 ( otak is optional) this cost the Mister $4.50. Not the crispy skin type of chicken but quite tasty and its the usual sweet sambal chili.
tried de grilled cchicken hor fun at the other stall but am deeply disappointed. please stick to the original corner stall in future
chicken cutlet hor fun
First time here last weekend! The apparently famous #nasilemak from #changivillage...hmm...
A must try when there!! Ipoh chicken hor fun and changi nasi lemak
Most amazing (hawker) western food I ever ate! It is so unique in a way that they sells many different and unique flavor of the grilled chicken. Here\'s teriyaki grill chicken. Worth every penny! 😊💰
say we cant just cycle without nothing in return right? awesome #supper #changivillage #nasilemak at 2am lol, Chicken Set $3.50. i was quite surprised that the hawker centre was totally revamped and now only 2 malay stalls and one drinks stall is operational. there were whole lot more 2 years ago. still, this was a good yummy food to keep us going for the next 15-16km back to east coast park. i miss nasi ayam penyet!
\'Best breakfast food to kick start a soldier\'s day. \' *sending cousin off for his enlistment* 
Very yummy fried carrot cake! But journey will took me 1.5 hrs. Cannot go too often!!
Amusing \'Media Recommendations\' signboards all every dish of the stall. Tasty original Ipoh Hor Fun. A favorite amongst army and the naval units around this locality.
For $4, you get a ginormous plate of ayam bakar rice with 5 flavours to choose from . Pic shows the famous sambal lado flavour . Chicken is slightly charred but still remains tender and flavourful. #sgfoodie #sgfoodgram #sgfoodporn #sginstafood #sgfood #sgfoodblog #burpple #foodie #foodgram #foodporn #instafood #foreverhungry #whati8today #wherei8today #singapore #malayfood #asianfood #singapore #ayambakar #changivillage

$6 to be exact if u minus the sunny side up, but it comes with chicken rice..\n<br />Chicken tasted like it’s Re-fried but it’s still decent as fried chicken is rarely serve with Rendang, let alone fried chicken cutlet. Portion of the Rendang could be more and more lemak would be better to compliment the breaded chicken!

This is supposed to be \"for 2 people\" but our party of 4 finished this heartily!
The Changi village food centre’s Chicken Chop noodles. I really like the texture of the noodles with their home made sauce. Their chicken chops are very well marinated that every piece (including the skin 😂😂😂), is worth eating. Each plate cost $3.50 and you can add $1 to upsize the chicken portions.

Their stall who occupies the previous famous \'international Nasi Lemak\' now have a steady line of long queue and I think theirs is the only stall which sells beef rendang as part of the side dish. While I think their Nasi Lemak is average, the fact that they served Beef Rendang is something that stand out amongst the many Nasi Lemak stall here!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#mizzycorner#nasilemak#coconutrice#changivillage#coconutmilk#chickenwing#hawkers#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

What else is better than satay and ketupat for dinner after cycling? 🚲😋🍙🍢\n<br />#yeyfood #satay #ketupat #burpple
Simply 3 scoops of ice cream that is wrapped in a pretty thin layer of \'pohpiah\' that didnt really leave the impression of prata to me at all. But well supper is always fun with friends at a camp, though wasn\'t in the mood for one tonight 😅

The evaporated milk added also helped to enhance the taste further.
It is enjoyable to dab in the chilli, along with the tempeh as well.
😋😍\n<br />*missing oyster omelette in this pic* \n<br />#growingfatwithfamily #teofamily #burpple
The portion is big for its pricing at $4! The chilli provided is also rather spicy so recommended to dap the chicken in!

Unique to the Changi Village Hawker Centre, this so-called \"Commando dessert\" is a popular hit among patrons. Some genius hawker decided to make red tea jelly and pair it with milk and longans.

Changi Village for dinner. Dinner with my good old bud.
Love the sauce and how crispy the chicken is. 😋👍
$2 for this large cup of Chendol (take-away) red bean 👍 grass jelly cubes, green jelly checked, Gula Meleka on point = decent Chendol p.s: this is from the hawker centre itself (they r popular for their soursop ice too) 
$3 rojak and the taste was nice! 
Best for rainy days!! Shiok!
Nothing matters having you by my side😚
Definitely a hidden gem!!! Look for a stall named village gossip to get this good looking plate of pancakes (drizzled w the owner\'s special sauce and butter) for 1.8$ yupz 1 freakin 80!!! So happy to devour these decent tasting pancakes (honestly better tasting than some cafes I\'ve been to) aft my half day cycle around pulau ubin #happy girl
