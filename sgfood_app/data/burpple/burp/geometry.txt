PRICE: $13.10 nett (Flavors: Earl Grey Tie Guan Yin and Bing Bong)
The watermelon lychee flavour stood out for me! But I decided to go for Earl grey tie guan yin being an Earl grey fan girl 😂
The warm hand crafted tart smells as good as it taste. The different colors of ice cream, bursting with flavors. The amiable staff explains why the shop is packed. Reasonably priced. A sweet house filled with enthusiastic dessert lovers.
Just next to ABC Market is this homely, cosy gelato parlour that serves 18 gelato flavours on a daily basis. After a shopping spree at IKEA, swing by and cool down with a scoop of Pistachio ice cream ($3.20) — creamy smooth gelato with nutty hints of the pistachio nut. We also really like the refreshing and soothing Earl Grey Tie Guan Yin — it\'s a premium flavour that you have to top up $0.70 for but it\'s totally worth it. If you\'re planning to stay a little longer, order the Handcrafted Tart ($9.90). The homemade crumbly tart comes with a scoop of gelato. \n<br />Avg price: $5 per person
Looooooooove this space. It\'s a quaint little shop, but one so warm and homely you\'d never wanna leave - we didn\'t at least. And honestly, with their selection of lovely gelatos, it really isn\'t hard to spend an entire afternoon there. Our fave was the Earl Grey Tie Guan Yin ice cream, which was so delicate, fragrant, yet intense all at the same time! The tart (frangipane, I believe) could be more moist and buttery, but it\'s a wonderful idea, and one that\'d be perfect with few improvements!
Geometry came about when these math teachers decided to stop teaching math and become ice-cream shop owner! Though in this picture our Earl Grey Lavender ice cream isn\'t perfectly spherical, we had a great time devouring it under this 35 Degree Celsius afternoon weather, and it\'s near our workplace, a great place to chill during tea breaks or after lunch desserts! Keep up the great service! 
But ice cream + homemade almond tart + salted caramel \'crown\' of candy floss.
The Handcrafted Tart (with 1 scoop - $9.90), best paired with their Pistachio gelato (super creamy and nutty 😋) on warm, buttery tart! Well presented with salted caramel threads and accompanied with some vanilla sauce.
💦🔥 Pair it with a handcrafted tart ($9.90) or a waffle ($8.50) to make it the perfect dessert for the crazy weather! \n<br />What more, enjoy the strings of salted caramel on top as you dig in! Do check out @geometry.sg for more! \n<br />P/S: they have 18 choices of flavors, so get ready to be spoilt for choice!
From Geometry, a new ice-cream parlour at Blk 2 Jalan Bukit Merah. Tried their Hockey Pockey ice-cream which is a vanilla-based ice-cream with bits of honeycomb within. The ice-cream was smooth and filled with speckles of vanilla beans that gives it that aromatic flavour, but I do wish that they could perhaps incorporate a little bit of honey into it to bring out a stronger incorporation of both elements. Quite liked how the homemade tart went; plated with a streak of vanilla sauce, the tart crumbles down neatly and subtly sweet in a cookie-like manner; an item I thought was pretty apt to have an ice-cream with.
For those who live around this area, drop by for a creamy scoop of ice cream! In hand is a paddle pop-like flavor, called Bing Bong! Shades of pink &amp; purple, this reminds me so much of childhood. \n<br />Congrats, @jeslynyeo on the new opening! May business be booming &amp; awesome for you!
Love the unique flavours @geometry.sg offer such as Earl Grey Tie Guan Ying, Genmaicha (Japanese green tea with roasted brown rice) and Strawberry Yuzu. Shall visit ABC Food Centre more often so I could have dessert at @geometry.sg 😂\n<br />・\n<br />#burpple #FoodiegohRedHill\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />・\n<br />#instadailyphoto #photooftheday #followme #picoftheday #follow #instadaily #food #yummy #foodstagram #foodgasm #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #dailyinsta #foodsg #singaporefood #whati8today #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #8dayseat #singaporeinsiders #singaporeeats #sgfoodtrend #sgigfoodie #thisisinsiderfood #foodinsingapore #foodinsing

Dont worry, the name of the cakes and ice cream flavours are not indicated as right angles or obtuse angles.
Back to desserts now. #burpple #tingzieeats

Never one to rest on their laurels, they have been constantly improving their ice cream flavours and even introduce new ones.\n<br />•\n<br />During my most recent visit, I had their Handcrafted Tart with Earl Grey Tie Guan Yin Gelato ($10.60), a perfect sweet treat after dinner. The buttery goodness from the tart, surprise from the almond tuile, gelato that was made with brewed tea from The 1872 Clipper Tea Co. and topped with a salted caramel floss were a genius pairing.\n<br />•\n<br />Geometry\n<br />Address: 2, Jalan Bukit Merah, Unit 01-5142, Singapore 150002 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #geometrysg #gelato #gelatometry

Great texture, served warm, and it had very buttery fragrance to it. Every order comes with a scoop of gelato. Additional scoop of gelato at $2.50 each.\n<br />🔸\n<br />They have 18 flavours of gelato (all homemade) which you can choose from. Pistachio has always been my choice if i do see it, it is superb! Very creamy, very nutty, they have roasted the nuts before processing it.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Being the greedy me, i cannot just settle for 1, so i ordered their best seller to add on, earl grey tieguanyin. Indeed good! 👍🏻 topped with their homemade salted caramel candy ball, which i did not get to taste it at all.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Geometry\n<br />2 Jalan Bukit Merah\n<br />Sun-Thurs, 12pm-930pm\n<br />Fri-Sat, 12pm-11pm\n<br />🔸\n<br />🔸\n<br />🔸\n<br />#geometrysg #sgdessert #homemadeicecream #sweettoothsatisfied #dessertslover #cafesg #sgcafe #foodiegram #burpple #sgfoodie #sgfood #stfoodtrending #instafood_sg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #sgfooddiary #sgmakandiary #igsg #topcitybites #nomsterofficial #city_noms #beautifulcuisines #foodbassador #singaporeliciouz
Rested on an almond tart and adorned with a salted caramel crown. Pretty cool. What i like is every element is made onsite. Thank you, Emma @geometry for your sweet hospitality. #gelato #icecreamlovers #dessertlovers #dessert #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #burpple #opensnap #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igers #stfoodtrending #igsg #singaporeinsiders #tripadvisor
