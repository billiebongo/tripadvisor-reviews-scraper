I shall head over to NP for some 🍰 when school starts. #burpple
A big hooray to having a cafe at work! I really enjoyed my Raspberry Tart and everything is super affordable too. A really cozy place!
Awesome tasting tarts at a little corner that no one knows! Hehehe. Here\'s some matcha x Salted Caramel x Lemon Meringue x Pure Chocolate x Raspberry Chocolate! Not very expensive for yummy tasting tarts ^^ 
Cupplets is one of the few cafes which uses blends from Common Man Coffee Roasters, which has a slightly more acidic taste profile as much as it is roasty. The cuppa is also rather creamy here; quite impressive for a cafe operating in school!
Meringue layers brings the neutral flavour to the tartness brought by the lemon. Tart base was firm without being hard.
Butterscotch, Caramalised Bananas and Chocolate cake. The light sweetness of bananas could be detected from the Butterscotch cream, which was intensely sweet. Probably appeals to sweet tooths more.
prettily decorated too.
Dessert table of very gorgeous sweets by Cupplets at the Club Monaco event! 
For Easties who\'ve been wanting to try Cupplets\' but lazy to travel so far, they\'re at Public Garden (Suntec Convention Hall 403, 13 June 1-7pm) today! Earl grey chocolate, brown butter gula Melaka, green tea azuki and green tea strawberry cakes ; elderflower champagne cupcake and their tarts are available. (// favourite would be Earl grey chocolate! Light fragrance and the layer of chocolate gives it another dimension. Green tea azuki is nicer than green tea strawberry based on my memory, cos it\'s much stronger and texture\'s better.)
HOW PRETTY IS THIS! *Inserts heart shaped eyes emoji* Cupplets offer customizable cakes for all kinds of occasions. Although only a small bakery in Ngee Ann Poly, no disappointments at all! 
Tarts average at about $4.30? (Some flavours were only $3.80 which is quite reasonable!) not a big fan of lemon meringue. We loved the cookie butter, matcha and salted caramel all of which weren\'t cloyingly sweet. One of my friend liked the crust more than the fillings haha. A little messy to eat though. Was a little disappointed that there\'s no cake - tried one at an event and it was damn pretty &amp; yummy!
Good coffee ☕️ for less than $5?! Had cake of the day: Hazelnut. It was awesome. At Cupplets // Ngee Ann Poly #cupplets #ngeeannpoly #cafesg #cake #yum #mocha
