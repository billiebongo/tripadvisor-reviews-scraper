Koka Noodles.
Filled with all the spice, so so prepare some ice water to go along, mix the egg yolk into the soup, and everything will be creamy and strong in flavour. Slurp the noodles, go with some pork meat and enjoy! üçú\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Located at Block 163, near Bukit Panjang MRT, a bowl will set you at ($4/$5). üëçüèª\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Tag us on the photo if you try it!

We tried both the standard and this spicy versions this morning to understand why. Undoubtedly the noodles were very springy and enjoyable. Broth was flavourful with the minced meat, spicy one would be more recommended for those who can take the heat. \n<br />Having said these, we wouldn\'t wake up during wee hours, less to travel here specially to eat this. And having heard that people actually queued 1 to 2 hours for it at night. Not us definitely, we aren\'t ones who would queue too long for food. \n<br />So if compared to instant noodles at home, this was a winner. But with some efforts and the koka instant noodles, it shouldn\'t be too hard to cook up something not too far from this. Maybe that\'s why the crowd we spotted were mostly the younger ones. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #burpproved #kokamee
25 minutes waiting time even on a weekday morning. Now how popular is this stall? It sells porridge and noodles variations, and is by no means any mind-blowing broth. üí´\n<br /> Still, the meat pieces are well-seasoned and a friend says the pig liver - which I don\'t eat- is done just nice.  For me, it\'s the soup, the springy noodles, vegetables and meat in one - an above-average food any day. ($3) Be warned, mealtimes waiting can go up to 45 mins.

Love love the soup. Simple, cheap  but awesome üòò
Came once but not opened. Tonight I came straight after a long flight, arrived at 2.30am, waited till 4am. Finally savoring on 2 bowls, one spicy and one non. Good stock, chewy noodles with minced pork, liver, eggs and veggie. Verdict: 4/5....worth the wait. ;))
