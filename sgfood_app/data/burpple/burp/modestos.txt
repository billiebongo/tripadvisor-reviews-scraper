Passable but not something you can\'t do just as well or even better at home.
The pasta is so delicious that we could just eat the pasta alone! A generous portion of clams. :)
Parma ham with forest of rockets on thin crusted woodfire base dived right into my heart, thanks Modesto‚Äôs.

This is exactly how we love our crispy &amp; yummy pizza to be!\n<br />üçï
Bonus?! Hold your joy as the \'succulent\' part was missing. All we could taste was cream\n<br />üßÄ
Woodfire pizza

It\'s never the end.\n<br />But a new chapter.
All thumbs up for Modesto\'s perfectly, perfectly al dente spaghetti. (P.S. i\'m no pasta snob anyway cos i have indigestion every single time i eat it üò¢). ^ That\'s the chef special: Slipper Lobster spaghetti with garlic and chili.

The only thing that\'s worth coming back for at Modesto is prolly their carbonara, pizzas and their leopard prints rimmed plates! SO FETCH!! üòç

Serving up good old creamy pasta 
Serving up traditional wood-fired pizza with good consistency 
After study chow; bring in the good stuff! RAWR!
Fun times for the troubled gf; cause that\'s what best buds are for
Break with a wild cuppa tea
