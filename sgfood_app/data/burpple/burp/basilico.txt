The season of the alluring White Albanian Truffles, \"trifola d\'Alba Madonna\" (\"Truffle of the White Mother\") in Italian. Its the pinnacle of Food, it\'s absurd price tag, due to its rarity &amp; yes, it\'s a Fungus. üôÉ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Chef Luca Beccalli made a Classic Pasta dish which consists of: Tagliolini Pasta with 40-Months aged Vacche Rosse Parmigiano Cheese, Occelli Butter &amp; Alba White Truffles (üíµS$68) üßÄ\n<br />Cooked al dente, the Cheese have a more pronounced taste than the Pungent Aromatic Truffles which are used sparingly. Oh Lord it\'s Good, just can\'t say no to Freshly Shaved Truffles be it White or Black but hopefully White, actually both will do Pleasurably Fine. üòã\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />ACAMASTIPSüíÆ: FU*K YOU Truffle Oil, Oil with chemicals 2-4 dithiapentane that gives the Truffle smell &amp; there isn\'t any damn Truffle in it. üñïüèª\n<br />\"One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef.\" Gordon Ramsay üññüèª
Comes with a crispy strip of caramelised #bacon to trick your palate between #sweet and #salty. Nice way to end the meal for the fickle who can\'t decide how. Created by @anngie._  #workatregentsg #savourydessert #burpple
Just some of the best desserts they serve at the best buffet. They have gelatos that are to die for. And the absolutely delicious passionfruit cheesecake. I was so full but still stuffed myself with the horribly awesome good food.
Omg this is like by far probably the best and most memorable buffet lunch I\'ve ever had. The cod fish in this is just cooked to perfection. i probably had like 10 pieces of it AT LEAST. Worth every cent spent. YUMMEHHHHHH
Just look at the spread - and this is only the cheeses! They\'ve even got a VEGAN and DAIRY-FREE #cheese, made from almond milk. Wow üßÄ
At the media launch of #Basilico\'s new Basilissimo dinner series--look at that glorious, beetroot cheese--where Executive Sous Chef Angelo Ciccone and Basilico Head Chef Luca Beccalli collaborate new quarterly menus. This year, their focus is on dishes influenced by the different mountains and seas of #Italy. #RegentSingapore
My immediate reaction to my companions - \"THIS PORK ROAST IS OUT OF CONTROL.\" The crazily loud crackle of skin, the thick layer of fat and the impossibly juicy and sweet oinky goodness - I know I\'m an occasional knight of hyperbole, but I must say that this is by far the best porchetta I\'ve ever had.
Basilico introduces a new menu by Chef Luca Beccalli! Our favorite dish is this beautiful handmade pasta I\'m craving for right now ‚Äì yes, at 10 in the morn.
Just the perfect finishing touch at yesterday\'s tasting of the new menu at Basilico ‚Äì exotic saffron gelato encased in a flawlessly glossy chocolate sphere. In a show of theatrics, hot chocolate sauce is poured over the globe so the upper dome melts and crumples into a rich, velvety puddle. Macerated cherries add bursts of boozy indulgence ‚Äì yum.
Oozing out between thin, crusty layers of flattened focaccia is a decadent, gooey, melted mess of deliciousness ‚Äì mozzarella, mascarpone and parmesan enhanced with black winter truffle. The bread-and-cheese combo has never tasted better.
Probably my fifth destructive hot chocolate waterfall visual extravaganza this year, but I still get damn excited each time!
\'Performance\' at the table for my dessert after a great Italian dinner tonight at Basilico, @RegentSingapore. Chocolate spheres that melts as 70% dark hot chocolate is poured over it. Inside the sphere is a scoop of homemade saffron gelato with Amaretti biscuits and Amarena Cherry. A scoop of everything together in your mouth is so delicious, pretty, yummy and instagramable.
Perfect for birthday dinners or romantic celebrations, Basilico is one of those places you really look forward to dining at. Aim to come on a weekday night, and enjoy what they call a \"semi-buffet\" ‚Äî a buffet spread of antipasti and desserts, and a choice of one main. Immerse yourself in a wonderful world of breads (go for the squid ink), cheeses (don\'t miss the truffle!) and charcuterie (parma ham with rockmelon) to start with. For your main, a juicy Sicilian rack of lamb is a good choice, and so is the decadent Risotto al Porcini. You won\'t be disappointed with their range of desserts ‚Äî think chocolate ganache tart, sorbets, cr√®me br√ªl√©e, pistachio cakes, and more. Lunch served on weekdays ($55++); a semi-buffet during weekday dinners ($88++); and buffet brunch is served on weekends ($98++). 
This is what I call a doughnut (or if you insist on spelling it as donut). Dough with pistachio and hazel nuts.
Here\'s #RegentSingapore Chef Angelo\'s rendition, enjoyed with herbed polenta. One of the savoury mains to be savoured at #Basilico.
For $88 per pax, you will get to enjoy one main course and a semi buffet of antipasti and desserts. The buffet spread was superb. However, the main course was a letdown. \n<br />My steak first came well done and I returned it. The next one was almost rare. Both nothing like medium. And then the third steak came rather tough as well. \n<br />Sad to see that the buffet overshadowed the main course which should be the focus of the meal. The staff was apologetic and didn\'t charge me for my meal. Hopefully they will resolve that soon. \n<br />Thanks to #thebestsisterintheworld for such an fantabulous day! üòò
I\'m not a dessert person myself but the sweets selection here really takes the cake üòâ Prepare to be dazzled by an impressive assortment of pastries, cakes, ice creams and sorbets, all artfully put together to beguile the senses and tempt the tastebuds. Pictured are dainty creme brulees, mini lemon meringues, financiers, pistachio cake, chocolate ganache tart and super refreshing lemon basil, strawberry and passionfruit sorbets. All delicious to taste as they are beautiful to behold üç¶üç®üç∞
Tiny bite-sized range of desserts available at #Basilico\'s buffet are what sweet-dreams are made of. üòã
Not a particularly common pasta seen here, fregola is a semolina pasta from Sardinia similar to Israeli couscous. Tossed with fatty smoked duck and peas,  it makes for a light but satisfying summer salad.
A taste tour to Italy at this great Italian restaurant. The incredibly juicy and flavorful lamb brought us to Sicily Island. //From now till the end of March, Basilico serves the flavours of Central Italy with the dinner menu, which is only available for dinner. Three-courses dinner with antipasti buffet, dessert buffet and a choice of main course priced resonaly at $88.  A $52 regular full-buffet lunch is served daily, and guests are welcomed to have dessert or appetizer buffet only. http://missneverfull.com/?p=3761#more-3761
What can I say? Full blown dinner, with extreme flavors, sight and smell. A great place for a romantic dinner, or a celebration. 
For all those Italian lover, this is the place to go. It\'s a semi-buffet, meaning you choose your mains. And the appetizers and dessert is \"free-flow\". Don\'t be mistaken with the quality here, it\'s top notch and never fail to impress from the service to the food. And personally been here a few times already, this recent trip topped it all. The mains were simply too delicious that no words can describe it. I have a feeling that the restaurant had a change in chef, and the mains were impeccable. Damn I am drooling already. 
Really weird and pungent smell of this dish which I am not even sure why I ordered as my main course...
Goat cheese with truffle that wins over all other food for the night.
Happy Easter everyone. #regent #basilico
Risotto Ai porcini. Risotto made with porcini mushroom, cured venison tenderloin and a wine reduction.
Gorgeous hand-painted chocolate spheres that break to delicately reveal an extremely fine pistachio mousse studded with Sicilian pistachio and raspberries. Only 12 pieces are available daily, order at @RegentSingapore\'s Dolcetto.
This Christmas bauble-inspired treat is a work of art, both for the eyes and the palate üòç
The chef shared that they worked with the Chinese chefs to achieve the crispy-licious skin! üëç
Basilico is unexpectedly good and the desserts are very unique. Italian buffet at its best! #food #foodporn #buffet üçïüçù

Basilico\'a Appetizers. Don\'t ask me for the dishes\' names... They\'re in Italian. #burpple
White chocolate gorgonzola was exceptional amongst the gorgonzola assortment. The cheese room (40 types of cheeses!?) is the latest addition to their dinner buffet line up and I swear I‚Äôd be belly up happy and heart stoppingly pleased if I can just have the cheese alone for my appetizer, main course and dessert!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#cheeseheaven #regentsingapore #basilicosg #burpple #burpplesg #foodpornsg #sgfoodie
Main course highlights at Basilico  yesterday was Chef‚Äôs Fregola Sarda con Bottarga with scallops with tiger prawns, mussels and Italy‚Äôs salted delicacy, the red mullet roe! Seafood was indeed a fresh catch and presentation was gorgeous!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Another Mind Blowing dish on the menu will be the Tonno alla Siciliana, a refreshing yet slightly tangy pan-seared lemon-crusted tuna loin with salmoriglio, fennel and orange salad, candied olives and Pantelleria capers. Love the will define layers of Tuna and the sauce really enhanced the entire dish to a whole new level!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Another favourite of mine will definitely be their slow-cooked duck breast! Surprisingly it was really tender and juicy upon every bite!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />To complement the dishes, Basilico Restaurant General Manager Mauro Serrajotto, a certified sommelier, has specially curated a small list of 20 wines for the perfect pairing.üç∑\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Priced @:\n<br />üíµ$92 per person\n<br />üíµ$127 per person, inclusive two glasses of house wine üíµ$147 per person, inclusive three glasses of house wine\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Invited by @decipherkieffer and was a Hosted Tasting by @regentsingapore üè®\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgeats #sgdinning #sgfood #sgfoodie #eat #food #foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #foodpic #foodphotography #exploresg #exploresingapore #exploreflavours #instafoodsg #instafoodie #instafood #Singapore #igsg #burpple #instagram #instagood #instadaily
Cheese buffet for $58 from now till 31 Jan
It‚Äôs always so hard to choose what kind of dessert I want so having all those options is a big bonus üòç.\n<br />I went to try every single item at their dessert counter (there are many more things not in the photo I assure you) and it was amazing!! By the end of it I was well and truly stuffed. Even though you may not like all the desserts, you will definitely find something that you love!! Some of my favourites was the Raspberry chocolate mousse cake, the pistachio millefeuille and of course, their gelato! One cannot leave Basilico without trying their assortment of gelato! The chocolate sauce and biscuit bits helped to take the chocolate gelato up to another level ü§§\n<br />Experiencing the dessert buffet is definitely a must at Basilico especially since it‚Äôs so value for money!\n<br />‚ÄîÔøΩ‚ÄîÔøΩ‚Äî\n<br />Basilico\n<br />Address: Regent Singapore, Level 2, 1 Cuscaden Road, 249715\n<br />Food: Dessert buffet (21++), with the appetiser buffet (64++), with a main course from the Basilissimo menu (88++)\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #dinner #buffet #dessert #regenthotel #basilico #burpple #burpplesg #pistachio #raspberrycake #chocolate #chocolatemousse #gelato #hotfudge #instaworthy #instafood #value #recommended #needtodiet #worthit
The ultimate garden to garden dining experience. Only at Basilico.
Weekday buffet lunch, this spread of cheese selection has spoilt most cheese lovers, yet still, few more other type of cheese is not in this photo. Too busy munching and chewing, this place is fully packed even on week days.
#BasilicoSG (Also congrats to #RegentSingapore on the star for Summer Palace!)
And of course the free flow prosecco and wines! \n<br />Sunday brunch at $120. With free flow proseco, red and white wines at $136.

Fat chunk of Haddock fillet, nicely wrapped up with strips of smoked pancetta (like an early Christmas present). Teamed with oh-so smooth, almost dream-like celeria pur√©e. The combination then punctuated with sweet-tart notes from red onions. üëç
This is part of the \"Alpi\" main course menu, which is available now till the end of the year. .\n<br />~\n<br />Medium-rare lamb loin done perfectly. The sweet paprika helped to reduce the gamey taste(I do like gamey meat though) and added another depth of smokey flavour as well!#Basilico never fail to deliver excellent lamb dishes!\n<br />#RegentSingapore #FourSeasons #EileenFoodTasting #EileenWantsToCampHere #Burpple #Burpproved #Italian #Lamb #Buffet @regentsingapore
It was a super dooper cheesy double-layered bread sandwiching a rich amount of cheese and truffle. So finger-licking good I can\'t ask for anything better üòª
Can\'t wait to kick back with some good drinks, food and even better company this evening! üòä

Meltingly tender beef cheeks, stuffed in pasta, then served in rich¬†Parmesan cheese fondue with beef jus, and even more¬†Parmesan.
(From July to September) .\n<br />~\n<br />Cavatelli Pasta(a kind of pasta from Southern Italy) with Baby Cuttlefish, Mussels, Lentils, Aglio Olio and Bottarga.\n<br />.\n<br />~\n<br />For strong crustacean flavour, the combination of fresh seafood harvest and bottarga(preserved egg sack of particular marine fish) packs a punch.
