a less than expected amount of fish inside? Could have been better given the price tag :/\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note hope y\'all are having a good weekend so far :) Can\'t believe it\'s Sunday tmr already sighhh
We couldn\'t ask for a better accompaniment to the bottle of red when we were at the park bench area on the ground level of Wheeler\'s Estate.\n<br />Packed onto the serving board were Nduja (a spreadable form of spicy pork salami), a slab of cheese, a school of silver anchovies, pickles, jalape√±o, fresh salad and half a loaf of pull-apart bacon and cheese bread. Yup, the weekend\'s off to a great start.
I had the Rustic Grill ($22++) which was 2 poached eggs on a bed of spinach and sauteed mushrooms, with grilled asparagus and something which tastes like hummus on the side. There was also a slice of bread underneath that load of food. Overall I liked this except for the thin slice of toast. The bread tasted dry and cakey and I didn\'t like the crust which had a strange burnt-cake taste. But everything else was pretty good. The hummus was delicious, and I liked that barley-rice thing on the side.
As the crabmeat was lightly dressed, the natural sweetness of it shone through nicely.\n<br />This would be a good choice if you are after something not too heavy for brunch.
At this pretty estate tucked away from the city area. It\'s like another world with fairy lights. Love the ambience absolutely. Including the live band. Ala carte menu is served at Level2 while Level1 is dedicated for bar.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @dianaaatan for the treat and sweet surprises and @veronicaphua for being the perfect accomplice and the cakes!\n<br />.\n<br />#wheelersestate #fishandchips #onthetable
Thank you @veronicaphua for the help and the desserts ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n<br />Remember to order the chocolate tart! It\'s really goodü§§
Even though our dinner reservation in their restaurant upstairs was in an hour, I couldn\'t resist ordering the mezze platter to while away the time.\n<br />My advice is to ignore the cutlery and use your hands to enjoy this. Just tear a chunk off the thick poufy pita bread (the three pieces came sprinkled with snow-white sea salt flakes) and use it to wipe and scoop up the hummus, babaganoush and salad to eat. Easy and fun.
Set in a beautiful colonial house, you would expect at least decent brunch grub. What we had instead was cold mushrooms, soggy rosti, bread that was probably toasted when I was still in my mom\'s ovary,  and eggs that look more curdled than scrambled. What a waste of a Long drive!
[Burpple Guides to Newly Opened] I\'ve haven\'t finished visiting all the places in @Burpple Guide to New Restaurants, Cafes and Bars for January 2017, and the February 2017 Edition is already out.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Twelve places were featured in January and another 10 places in Feb (tap the link in my profile for the Feb 2017 list). How many of these new places have you visited?\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Pictured is at Wheeler\'s Estate featured in the Jan 2017 Edition. Next up, keep a look out for the Tastemakers Guide to AMK Hawkers which would be published really soon.
We had their Chicken in Peruvian BBQ Style ($36++), Cheeky Swine¬†($25++) - tender pork cheeks with melt-in-the-mouth fatsüòã sitting on parma ham,¬†garnished¬†beautifully and also the Spiced Wedges ($15++). Bill came up to $120 for 3 pax. The food was good but did not justify the price, perhaps more of the ambience. Love the place, perfect for a date night ‰∏ãÊ¨°Ë¶ÅË∑ü‰∏ÅÂ∞ë‰∏ÄËµ∑‰æÜüòç
Set in the lush surroundings of Selatar Aerospace Park, Wheeler\'s Estate (by the same guys behind Wheeler\'s Yard) is far out enough to make a visit feel like an adventure ‚Äî one that would reward you with good food! Prices are on the high side, but its colonial bulding setting makes it quite romantic, so save this for special date nights or celebrations. If you\'re in a group, order the fun Pull Apart Breads ($12) to share ‚Äî we heard the one with cheese and bacon is really good! The portion is generous, so save the tummy space for their mains if it\'s just the two of you. Try the 300g Ribeye ($45 with one side), not only for its smoky, perfectly grilled meat, but also the delicious side of roasted pumpkin with honey yoghurt. Another favourite is the elegant Flounder ($45), which Burpple Tastemaker Justin Teo describes to be moist, tender and covered in delicious lemony almond crumbs. \n<br />Avg Price: $80 per person \n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Justin Teo
With the theme song from \"The Flintstones\" cartoon show running through my head, the caveman in me was unleashed to attack this brontosaurus-sized Tomahawk Steak. I wasn\'t going in alone; there were three other equally gung-ho diners with me.\n<br />The meat was juicy, tender and had done-ness ranging from medium-well at one end to mostly medium-rare (which means all of us found slices that suited our preference).\n<br />We also scooped out the bone marrow to have on its own - I have to warn you, it was exceedingly rich and guilt-inducing.\n<br />For our choice of two sides, we went with the green beans saut√©ed with strips of ham and the duck fat fried potatoes. Both were really satisfying.\n<br />After having the fresh oysters and pull-apart bread for starters, followed by this gigantic serving of steak, we were so completely filled we had to think very hard if we could squeeze in desserts.
‚Ä¢\n<br />The batter\'s certainly light and crispy, and the fish\'s definitely fresh and flaky. But, on the whole, the dish was still pretty lackluster considering that we had paid $28 for it.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />P.S.: If you include the service charge and GST, the dish would cost approximately $33.
The fillets are fried to a crisp golden perfection - it retains its crispy &amp; crunchy exterior throughout the entire meal!  Loved the presentation (on a boat-like plate), carries with it a hint of thai in my opinion.\n<br />_
‚Ä¢\n<br />It is only the first day of Semester 2 and I\'m already feeling super exhausted. ‚òπÔ∏è #deprivedofsleepandcoffee\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />The first lecture on public health was pretty entertaining but setting foot on campus was just too draining for my anaemic soul. üò•\n<br />All that I wish to do now is to rest my head on a fluffy, bacon-scented brioche pillow. üò¥ Goodnight world!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />P.S.: Knife in photo suggests that it\'s hard to pull off the pull-apart bread. LOL. üòÇ
Three halves of lobsters was gratinated with gruyere and served with Waldorf salad. Lobster flesh was rather fresh, with a nice smoky scent on the part of the flesh closest to the shell but could be perceived as dry for those who likes steamed juicy lobsters.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The Waldorf salad was a lovely surprise. Bits of crunchy croutons and walnuts tossed in mayonnaise served with thinly sliced apples - refreshing, sweet, savoury and nutty in a single bite. #seafood #lobster #cheese
This has a nice charcoal yet woody scent on its exterior. Curious whether it was cooked by charcoal fire or wood fire, we asked Chef Jayd Kitt explained that it was over charcoal with wood chips and herbs. So loving the aroma.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The sides were stellar too, the whole lettuce was grilled whole and provide a refreshing contrast to the meat, while the roasted pumpkin with honey yoghurt was cooked till infinitely mashed - really smooth.
[New Restaurant] This was my first meal of 2017 and it turned out great. Bourbon and cider braised pork cheeks sitting on gorgeous floral and saffron cream... this was so good.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />The pork cheeks came with a top layer of gelatinous fats, but the lean part was moist as well. Best paired with the parma ham beneath to add a savory dimension to that clean taste of pork you\'re getting here.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Looking forward to a great year ahead!
Our favourite among the four of us, this fish had a moist and tender flesh enveloped by that nutty lemon crumbed exterior, such a lovely complement in both taste and texture.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />As you finish half the fish and flip it to the other side, you\'ll realise that there was no almond crumbs, so there you\'ll only focus on the taste of the fish and realise the very delicate sweetness with no signs of fishiness.
Available as a side when you order the steaks here, this turned out to be an item that totally deserves to be in the limelight.\n<br />I haven\'t had pumpkin paired with yogurt prior to this, and found the combination, most delicious.\n<br />Would definitely order this again just to have it on its own.
Great place to bring the family. Now, who says Aunties cannot be hipsters too? -\n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2016/12/22/wheelersestate/\n<br />-\n<br />Model: Auntie Helen \n<br />Everything Else: Mr \"BaoKaLiao\" @danielfooddiary
When someone else\'s order of this went swooping by, I was struck by its attractive presentation and I decided to try one too. \n<br />The \"BBQ Naked Prawns\" featured a pair of large, naturally sweet crustaceans topped with finely minced mixture of garlic and chillies. Next to it, a generous smear of taramasalata which added a nice little salty, creamy edge to the prawns.\n<br />To be honest though, I think the fish and chips is a better choice if you are hungry. That comes in a much larger portion. This is more suitable for sharing, or if you are after something light.
Dinner date with the husbands at the newly opened Wheeler\'s Estate.
They weren\'t kidding when they actually stated in the menu that this is good for 2 pax; we were actually felt decently full just sharing this (we are small eaters). Think a Hawaiian Pizza atop a chicken cutlet because this is indeed what it is ‚Äî the top of the chicken cutlet smeared with tomato pur√©e while topped off with slices of ham and finally with a layer of melty cheese that gives that stretchy, oozy texture. The chicken cutlet was decent though nothing much to shout about, while the tomato pur√©e gives it a tanginess that cuts through the cheesiness so it\'s pretty easy to go through the entire thing. The thick-cut chips cane filled with potato; soft and fluffy while well-seasoned in an ample amount of salt. The greens on the side were particularly appetising especially given the cheesiness of the entire dish. 
If you have a group of family or friends who enjoy a sinfully good roasted suckling pig, you should consider the one at Wheeler\'s Estate. We pre-ordered ours to celebrate my mum\'s birthday and my whole family relished it with gusto. \n<br />Served with the gleaming golden-brown roasted Spanish piglet was a big tray of soft, chargrilled capsicums, big chillies and cherry tomatoes plus a jug of balsamic vinegar to balance the overall flavour mix.\n<br />Following the Spanish style of service (which also happens to prove the immense crispness from a successful roasting), the chef actually uses a plate to cut the piglet up into small pieces. This is done table-side on a trolley, allowing for ample opportunities to capture the action on video if you like.
The Pull-apart Bread was so fun and easy to share. Everyone just tore or cut a chunk off the loaf to eat. All of us found it really tasty as well - we got the one that had cheese and big slices of lean bacon baked into it.\n<br />I reckon it can feed between 4 and 8 people, depending on how much of a carb-lover everyone is.
The \"Beef Short Ribs\" at newly-opened Wheeler\'s Estate is a real showstopper.\n<br />Three large pieces of beef ribs (tender from being prepared sou vide) are topped with \"Bulldog BBQ sauce\" and presented on a long wooden board. Accompanying them are tiny fregula pasta, grilled pineapples, fresh chillies and peppers. There\'s also a bowl of crispy potato wedges perched on one end. I really like that there\'re two elements of cut-through included: a housemade minced garlic and chilli mixture, plus pickled whole green chillies.\n<br />Without a doubt, it is an appetising dish that will leave you sated if you\'re dining solo. Alternatively, this is suitable for sharing if you want to try more of the Aussie-style dishes served here.\n<br />(Full disclosure: Wheeler\'s Estate is owned by family but please note, my opinion is objective).
The beer batter used in \"The Fish &amp; Chips Shop\" was remarkably light and crunchy. What I found especially impressive was how it stayed that way until the end of my meal. Yup, the crispness I experienced biting into the fish when it had cooled down was the same as when it was served piping hot. Although I favour skinny fries in general, the chunky style of fries (a.k.a. \"chips\") featured here proved pretty addictive.\n<br />On another note, the presentation in a long boat-like structure made it visually arresting, and quite different from the usual. Some might say it\'s a tad gimmicky but I liked it.
Thank you everyone who I have met on IG and in person for the past year!
A little too sour for my taste buds

@veronicaphua chose the cheesecake and chocolate ganache tart and both were excellent choices.\n<br />*\n<br />The cheesecake was not too dense nor too sweet a just the right consistency and flavour\n<br />*\n<br />The chocolate ganache tart was my type of dessert - not sweet at all.

150 day grain fed Angus flap meat with cheese sauce, bell peppers, onions and jalape√±os. This was surprisingly very well done.\n<br />*\n<br />Similar to the Nagano pork cutlet, the steak was grilled with specially imported jarrah, apple and lychee firewood. The outside was chargrilled with a smoky yet tasty flavour but the inside was still tender. A must order!\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @veronicaphua for the introduction.

With sticky Bourbon glaze and served with coleslaw. This was prepared at the Grill House with specially imported jarrah, apple and lychee firewood.\n<br />*\n<br />The result was a very well seated cutlet which was still tender to the bite.

There are so many interesting nooks and crannies. You can get lost wandering around the estate. Space is hardly a constraint here.\n<br />*\n<br />We finally went on a Thursday night when DoTTs, a band of 2 brothers, was playing English classics. I grew up listening to live bands in Ipoh and Penang, so you can imagine how thrilled I was that night. Being able to listen to a live band in a chill and laid back setting was so nostalgic for me. It helped too that the voices of DoTTs were amazing and so soulful.\n<br />*\n<br />I have to admit that I wasn\'t expecting much from the food. I was so wrong. We were pleasantly surprised - more in my next post.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_wheelersestate #wheelersestate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Picturesque in Seletar.
I guess this is Wheeler Estate\'s version of Big breakfast! Slightly pricey at $24! But we were lucky enough to just share this plate between two person as we observe the gigantic plates on the other tables! Granted it is big portion, but if we nip pick, it is not great. It\'s just how it\'s expected to taste like even though I find the scramble egg too wet for my liking... However the Rosti is worth mentioning as it is truely tasty and since we\'re sharing, wish there\'ll be more! The bull dog sauce (reminiscent of a variation of a BBQ sauce) does add some other profile to the meal which works for me as it buffers the nearly 100% savory meal with the a touch of sweetness and acidity to cut through the flavors!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#wheelerestate#breakfast#bigbreakfast#cafesg#scrambleeggs#foodie#eatsg#delicious#seletaraerospacepark#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#cafe#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

This Chicken Parmigiana would definitely recommended be mentioned if you asked their staff. The large piece of chicken was moist inside, covered with ham and mozzarella cheese on top. Non-oily and not-salty, it was tasty and certainly filling. Much better even compared to similar chicken dish at Jamie\'s. \n<br />That much said, just lay back and enjoy the tranquility around. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved
The way their food was done was on point and beautiful. \n<br />This grilled octopus was a great dish to start a meal. Big and chunky cuts grilled to a smokey char outside without compromising on the tenderness of the meat. The rest on the plate only had to play subtle supporting roles to let the star shine. \n<br />This Estate was one to let the mind rest and allow the palate to enjoy. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #chargrill
No pun intended but this place\'s really more for those with wheels as it isn\'t really accessible from public transport. But once here, the trip\'s all worth it.\n<br />We tried both their popularly recommended Fish n Chips and Chicken Parmigiana. Both were nicely done and attractively presented. Loved that their food were non-oily, not salty and allowed us to flavour to our own likings with the sea salt and sauces. \n<br />Inaccessible as it might be, be informed that the place was filled by the start of dinner hour even when they had seatings at 2 levels and in the open. An area for improvement had to be their service which seemed to lack some system, which was slow during peak hour. Nonetheless, there were some that were professional and proactive. \n<br />Overall, this was 1 place we would visit for its ambience, although its price might be higher compared to its counterpart the Wheeler\'s Yard. Couldn\'t compare directly b\'cos menu was totally different from the latter though. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved
Prawns and Crab with Garlic, Chilli and Parsley.¬† Each strand of pasta is coated generously with the thick and umami-packed sauce.¬† Definitely one of my favourites here. (Date: 31 December 2016 Saturday) #MsJaniceEats_Pasta
It comes with chips and garden salad.
I really pity this loaf of bread.¬† Firstly, it was stabbed.¬† Then, it was pulled apart. üòÇ Well, at least it \"suffered\" for a great cause, which was to feed our hungry tummies. üòä¬† Many thanks to my lovely hand model @experimentalprivatechef who executed the stabbing pose with aplomb. üëç (Date: 31 December 2016 Saturday) #MsJaniceEats_Cafes
With raspberry and passionfruit compote standing in ovation. The thin delicate chocolate tuille flanked in glory. Berries so vibrant, it gives the cheesecake a hint of citrussy feel.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />One of the softest and lightest cheesecake that I enjoyed. It was gently and tenderly demolished.
Crispy on the outside while warm and soft on the inside, this is a perfect dish for sharing during gatherings.
For desserts go for the choc tart hands down. Sad there\'s no pull apart bread :( #burpple
Lunar New Year may be a few weeks away but we decided to get an early serving of auspicious Âπ¥Âπ¥Êúâ‰Ωô/È±º with this gigantic flounder.\n<br />It was a big hit with the four of us due to its very moist and flavourful flesh, and blanket of crust that\'s lightly crunchy. We also relished every bit of the wilted spinach and grilled vegetables that came with it. \n<br />This is large enough to be shared between two or even four persons, depending on how many other dishes are ordered.
*\n<br />Decided to check out the newly opened @wheelersestate that is less than 1 month old for brunch today after seeing Ms @veronicaphua\n<br />Post\n<br />*\n<br />Featuring:\n<br />1) Pull Apart Bread- Cheese &amp; Bacon 14.0\n<br />*\n<br />2) Crisp Squid - Brazilian Spice, Rocket and passion fruit coulis 20.0\n<br />*\n<br />3)Linguine Sorrento- Prawns &amp; Crab with garlic, Chili &amp; Parsley 23.0\n<br />*\n<br />4) Peruvian BBQ Style- Wheeler\'s Estate Chef\'s take on Pollo a la brasa, a delicious wood fired Grilled butterflied chicken with secret salsa aji Verde, 36.0\n<br />*\n<br />5) The Fish &amp; Chip Shop- Beer battered  fillet with chips, salad, salt &amp; Vinegar, pickled onions and lemon gribicle, 28.0\n<br />*\n<br />The crowd favourite was definitely the Fish &amp; Chips. We took a while to took photos but the batter of the fish still remains crispy through outüòÅ\n<br />We all also enjoyed the thick cut fries too. It\'s so yummy.\n<br />*\n<br />I\'m a bread lover and I\'ll definitely recommend the Pull Apart Bread. One taste and I fell in love with it. Home-baked bread definitely wins my heartüòçüòçüòç\n<br />*\n<br />Wheeler\'s Estate\n<br />2 Park Lane \n<br />Seletar Aerospace Park\n<br />S(798386)\n<br />Tel: 9025 4198/ 6262 0001\n<br />*\n<br />Operating hours\n<br />Sat to Mon- 8am to 10.30pm\n<br />* Tues- Closed\n<br />Wed &amp; Thurs- 11am to 10pm\n<br />Fri- 11am to 10.30pm\n<br />*\n<br />#wheelersestate\n<br />#burpple\n<br />#hungrysquad\n<br />#foodstarz\n<br />#eatbooksg\n<br />#whati8today\n<br />#videomasak\n<br />#phaat\n<br />#eatlikeshit\n<br />#dailyfoodfeed\n<br />#foodbossindia\n<br />#losangeleseats\n<br />#eatbooksg \n<br />#ExploreSingaporeEats\n<br />#ExploreSingapore\n<br />#eatingnyc\n<br />#damien_tc\n<br />#singaporeinsiders\n<br />#thisisinsiderfood

You can also select one of many sides such as steakhouse chips, roasted pumpkin with spiced honey yoghurt and cauliflower gratin to go with your steak but nothing is going to take the limelight away the scotch fillet that will bring up a gustatory sensation to your tastebuds
The bubbles of the beer did make a difference in the desired lightness of the batter and the pearly white fish within can take pride in its freshness, softness and its tantalizing flavour.\n<br />The chips themselves are fried to a delightful crisp and has this tinge of salt and vinegar flavour which makes it really addictive.
