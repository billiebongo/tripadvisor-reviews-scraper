Refreshing yet decadent chilled broth, definitely one of the best chilled Korean buckwheat noodles I\'ve had in Singapore 😍 the kimchi and anchovy ban-chan here are my favorite too!! 
($12.90) Just when you thought wow Korean curry Tonkatsu, your tastebud is greeted by a tangy sauce along with the large breaded pork cutlet. You know why this is found on almost every table in the small stall, the tangy sauce (I\'m guessing tomato sauce and a little Korean plum extract // (edited) after a little fact find: \n<br />Worcestershire sauce, a complex condiment of vinegar and sugar substances) prevents the dish from getting too starchy and overwhelming from a sauce over fried cutlet pairing! Two thumbs up for such a ingenious pairing! 
Huge portion and lots of seafood! 
Quite a big portion great for sharing :)
