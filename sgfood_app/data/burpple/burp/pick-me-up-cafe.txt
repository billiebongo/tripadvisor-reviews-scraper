A great late nite treat..
Seen here is the Caramelized Banana French Toast which was served during our #sugarrush last night.
Especially #gelato in between dinner and supper. =D This is yogurt-based berries gelato! ^^ #wewantsugar #cafehoppingsg #cafehop #sgfood #igsg #sgfoodies #instagramsg #foodphotography #instafood #foodstagram #foodporn #foodgasm #foodblog #openricesg #8dayseatout #burpple #yummypin #sg50 #sg50signaturefood #sgfood #sgfoodies #we1sugar #eatandbrunch
This waffles is crispy, light and fluffy with a generous serving of fruits drenched in maple syrup and then topped off with a healthy, refreshing and very delicious yoghurt based gelato - a winner on its own, the Manuka Honey Nougat.
Using this #hipster filter for a #hipsterwaffle. Lol. #Waffle wasn\'t crispy enough for me but I loved that it had a #PeanutButter flavor. #Sorbet on top was pretty good too! Nice #cafe to chill at #eastcoastbeach

$17 Manuka...a type of waffle with fruits and ice cream. Not too bad for ppl with sweet tooth. Cosy place for get together...you can seat for a long time coz their serving is very slow
