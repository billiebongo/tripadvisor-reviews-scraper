Really liked the Korean Strawberry and \n<br />Honeyscotch icecream! They tasted good just as they were, and even better when paired with the salted egg yolk sauce. I know what flavours I\'m ordering when I come back here😋
Who would have ever thought of a combination like this?! They complement so well and I love the flavours offered at Twenty Grammes! :\')
Seriously, I still am in disbelief that such a cafe exist in the midst of your usual unsuspecting block of hdb. Once you step inside you would feel the difference just a door apart from the \"outside world\". Love how clean the whole cafe looks. We ordered the charcoal waffles with salted egg yolk sauce topped with the Earl grey lavender and strawberry miso ice creams. Strawberry miso?? Whats that? Well it\'s the ingenious of combining both sweet and savoury flavors to tease your palettes. I personally love it. And it\'s like heaven is a place on earth when combined with the oh so rich I can taste salted egg yolk sauce(especially after a disappointing salted egg yolk dinner just minutes before). Together with the charcoal waffles? Brilliant just brilliant. The Earl grey lavender ice cream though...if you\'ve ever had a spa experience before you would know what I mean by I felt like I was consuming the massage oil. Not in a bad way, just it was something too familiar to be consumed. Definitely heading back to try more ice cream flavors and the Yuan Yang waffles. I\'m so envious of whoever lives near this area! 😉
The waffle was light on the inside, crispy on the outside, thick, fluffy and sweetened just the way I like it! The salted caramel had a good balance of sweet and salty, while we would\'ve liked the black sesame to have a stronger sesame aroma. On a side note, I need to come to AMK Ave 10 more often. It\'s foodie paradise😍
Yuan Yang waffle with soft serve. Loved the black parts more, and the crunchy bits of granola. Definitely worth coming back for ;) PS: take your snap quick before it becomes a leaning tower like this. More on ig: tiara_star
Yuan yang waffle $15 \n<br />Probably the best charcoal waffle I\'ve tried so far! Loved the hazelnut chocolate sauce and the creamy soft serve that though melted pretty quickly still managed to tahan my photo taking duration 😂 🙌 model : @hongyao_zhuang
Nutella ice cream &amp; Salted caramel ice cream with salted egg yolk sauce
@twentygrammes is opened at their AMK outlet till 10pm today! We\'ve just had their Yuan Yang Waffle ($15), which was pretty DELISH! We chose this over the waffle with  SALTED EGG SAUCE because I thought the ice cream I tried were all overwhelmingly sweet!
Charcoal salted egg yolk waffle + a scoop of strawberry ice cream ($13) to satisfy my cravings. YUMM ~
So because I had shared my prata brunch, feeling hungry still (and for the man, sleepy), we went for coffee. Except coffee for me means stuffing me face with some dessert while sipping some of his coffee.
TG Waffles vs Charcoal Waffles. Hard to decide which one? Save yourself headache by going for Yuan Yang Waffles which is a specialty at this second outlet. The freshly baked waffles are interestingly divided between charcoal and classic Belgium batter topped with a generous scoop of homemade milk soft serve, decorated by flavoured cookies sticks. Bonus part is the pot of nutella sauce, that you can drizzle over the waffles/ do your Instagram shot!!
😅 This is at their latest outlet @ AMK. 😊 \n<br />We prefer the \'yuan yang w soft serve\' to the \'charcoal waffles with salted egg yolk sauce\'! 😋👌🏻 ps: be prepared to wait when you\'re here. 😅
Bad news: They looked like styrofoam.\n<br />Badder news: They tasted like styrofoam.
Their cookie butter softserve is really good and it will be even better if the cookie butter flavor is stronger! Their waffle is really soft and not too crispy

To infinity &amp; beyond with one of their latest gorgeous creation, essentially a galaxy beauty hiding 80% chocolate mousse &amp; vanilla sponge. It\'s a therapy inside out &amp; vice versa.

This was the Hojicha softserve with waffle cubes. Definitely IG-worthy with those beautiful purple lavender petals. But the texture of the softserve wasn\'t as creamy as we expected it to be; more on the icy side in fact. Waffle cubes were crispy good though. Overall a decent dessert though there were better ones around either for the softserve or waffles. But then again, chill cos it\'s TGIF! #burpple #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #sgfoodies #sgfoodpic #sgeats #sgig #foodieSG #foodgram #foodies #instafood_sg #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodstagram #exploresingapore #instagramsg #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #cafehoppingsg #foodloversg #igsgfoodies #whati8today #bupplesg #burpproved #waffles #hojicha
Hojicha itself is a Japanese green tea that is roasted in a porcelain pot over charcoal rather than steamed thus making it different from the other categories of green tea

It is served with milk soft serve and chocolate hazelnut sauce. The waffle is crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside.

Yuan yang waffle with soft serve. 
Rich and good molten cake with salted caramel ice cream. 
So let our hair down and enjoy, not without a good crispy fragrant waffle topped with milk soft serve and thick chocolate sauce. Make it a Yuan Yang waffle and add a Thai milk tea ice cream to double the pleasure. \n<br />A nice place here to find interesting waffle treats. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #chocolate #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #waffle

A light brew, not too strong. Got to be the quality of the beans. Verdict: 2.5/5
Price: $12\n<br />•\n<br />🚇: Ang Mo Kio\n<br />•\n<br />Opening their second Outland in the heartland. I finally managed to try their famous charcoal ice cream drizzle with salted egg. \n<br />•\n<br />A combination of chocolate, caramel and chocolate chunks, triple C works nicely for us. Not too Sweet and with chunks, it gave the ice cream a nice crunch.\n<br />•\n<br />The charcoal flavour was not distinctive enough for us. But the waffle texture was nice. Crunchy but not burnt and fluffy on the inside. \n<br />•\n<br />The disappointing part was the salted egg sauce. It had a stale taste. I could not taste any salted egg yolk at all... 😞\n<br />•\n<br />I will definitely give twentygranmes a try again. Maybe the next time, I will try their soft served. \n<br />•\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #sg #sgfood

What an old school waffle for my \'old\' boyfriend @desmondodinson ! 👍🏽 Baby was really sweet to suggest having dessert after our dinner and he was even sweeter waiting for me to be done with all the food photography! This is him having fun drizzling all of that awesome condensed milk sauce on our #waffle hahaha 😁
Still prefer Creamier\'s ice cream waffles. This is kinda doughy though the flavorful salty taste exuded by the charcoal black waffle makes up for it. Pistachio ice cream has a fragrant nutty taste that we wished the scoop was a tad bigger than it was. Thai milk tea ice cream, my all time favorite!!! Bak kut teh and ice cream waffle date with my secondary school friend, Wanxuan. WE FORGOT TO TAKE A PICTURE TOGETHER. 😅😅😅 #cafe #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgfood #food #foodie #igfood #foodig #foodsg #foodporn #foodphoto #igag #foodpic #burpple #openrice #hungrygowhere #whati8today #eatout #waffle #saltedegg #icecream #foodstagram #instafood #instagramsg #dessert
Haven\'t really figured it out. It could be the colour combination 😂 or the milky soft serve. \n<br />But @twentygrammes now has Thai milk tea soft serve 😍 time to had back 😂

Love the caramelised sauce!😋
Why is my soft serve crooked!  Oh well that aside,  the milk soft serve was really good,  went well with the yuan yang waffles(combination of buttermilk and charcoal).😉👍 Sadly,  this outlet kinda lack the original crispyness the waffles had from its main outlet😢😢
Heard and seen many pictures of such combi for waffles and finally tried it today. There\'s a new cafe near my work place! Getting more happening 😊

Ermm.. Nice to have a waffle shop nearby. 
You could still hear the crunch sound even when it turns cold 😂 Great for those who like their waffles VERY crispy. Highly recommend their Thai red tea, Triple C, Affogato &amp; Sea salt caramel 🍦!
