Angel hair pasta tossed with truffle salsa and top it up with a bull‚Äôs eye egg yolk. Love it. 
Roasted chicken leg with garlic charred broccoli and mash potato (I swopped out the wedges). Love the food and ambience here, would visit often! 
Choose from Greens and Protein. Food is reasonable for its price. This plate cost me about $15! 
a decent truffle fries though the truffle oil could be more generous.$7 w/o gst and service charge
A perfect way to end your day is...dessert! This tart doesnt disapppoint me though i would love to see the caramel shine through more.nevertheless the tart is delicious! oh btw that chocolate is sooooo fine!
(Pretty sure I ordered truffle fries not normal friesüò°) #burpple
at table manners some time back. a trip to changi and was hoping it was THAT good since I picked it up on so many blogs. apart from the fancy communal dining set, the food turned out to be pedestrian only. imho. or did i order the wrong stuff?
I like table manners because we can sort of customise what we want and the size of our mains. Not constricted to just one size. Their desserts was yum too! #burpple
We chose 2 \"starters\" and 2 \"mains\". Truffle Fries, Scrambled Eggs, Eggs Royale &amp; Beer Battered Fish Fillet. So that\'s a \"Set D\". It\'s an interesting concept; and total we paid $22/- for this set. Pretty affordable and it fed 2 people well. Worth another visit! :)
Lovely desserts from Table Manners, check out DanielFoodDiary.com for review and voucher giveaways!
Filling First brunch of the year!!! At the much raved about brunch place, truffle fries was a disappointment üò™ although the buttered mash and ambiance made up for it.  #brunch #newyear #tablemanners
A satisfying dinner, this burger came with a juicy patty, bacon, egg and well-toasted bread buns. The truffle fries were a nice side, though definitely not the best around. Pleasant ambience as well. $20, 4/5
King\'s Burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, truffle fries topped with a happy sunny side egg. When it is split apart, there is generous portion of onion relish. Are you hungry yet?
#latergram from last night\'s dinner! SUPER SATISFIED :D and this is not all we ate (can you imagine how much we were pigging out :p)
Birthday doesn\'t need to be celebrated with many people and hosted in a grand and classy place. As long as you\'re celebrating it with your love ones. That\'s all matters.
Very nice ambience, even having a live local band singing just nearby. Its a good place to go when you are willing to spend a little and catch up with friends. The food is good as well, and the service was up to standard. My friends and I didn\'t have to wait long for the food and drinks. Good for about 2-6 people groups.
Delicious thick chocolate above a layer of caramel topped with sea salt
Medium rare beef and pork burger with what I believe is truffle fries
No criticisms about these two. Ended dinner well with them two. Could really down more cakes with the small portions.
nice dinner to end a lazy Sunday. But...OSIMA!! #dinner #dessert #tablemanners
How could anyone resist this on the menu, right? ;) A nice dose of salty and sweet, satisfying enough, though I\'ve had thinner and crunchier crust.
This didn\'t blow me away, but I did enjoy the juicy and tasty beef patty. (btw, if you\'re there during evening happy hours - bar snacks are S$6 per serving. Don\'t miss their Truffle Chicken Bites - must try! Truffle fries, on the other hand, nothing to rave about) ;)
Sea salt caramel chocolate tart. Love how the crust doesn\'t crumble when I cut the tart. The sea salt flakes on top was a nice touch.
Eggs royale with tomato mozzarella salad and mushroom ragout. Everything was good except for the mushrooms.
Cajun marinated chicken with scrambled eggs and truffle fries. The sauce was the saving grace of the chicken which was a bit dry. I had to get extra helping of the sauce. After having the truffle mushroom soup, I found the truffle oil insufficient for the fries.
was quite looking forward to dining here, having heard/read about the place. simply furnished, with drinks and coffee made by people from barstories and papa palheta, it was a pretty nice place for a relaxed dinner. the table in the centre of the restaurant was a long zig zagged table and we were sitting at a space in the middle of the whole long table. the clever design of the table allowed us our own space but it also meant seats on the inside werent so accessible and that whatever was happening to the parties next to us could affect us. which in our case, the guys getting high on alcohol next to us hit the table with some force a few times. food was not bad imo, though the common stuff like fried chicken werent much impressive. i thought the drinks (we had mocktails, a cocktail, liquor and beer among the 5 of us) were good. the place could be good for a quiet cosy date or girls night out, or a loud and fun group outing, depending on where you are seated. 
What I like about Table Manners is how you can craft your own platter of food. :D
Drizzled with truffle oil (if my tastebuds do not serve me wrong).
The broccoli was extremely tasty and the chicken was good too.

You can choose your own protein and vegetables according to your diet. What I have Chosen is this saut√©ed mussels buttered white wine cream sauce served with aglio olio and classic Caesar salad. Woo. I love the food here.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodspotting #bonappetit #setheats #burpple  #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #8dayseat #exploresingapore #exsgcafes #beautifulcuisines #onthetable #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #instafood_sg #myfab5 #singaporeinsiders #vscofood #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #exploresingapore #onthetable #foodstagram #openricesg
