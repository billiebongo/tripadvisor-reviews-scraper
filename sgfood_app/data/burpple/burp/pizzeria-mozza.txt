Although I try to be adventurous, the creature of habit in me wins most of the time. üòÖ And this ensemble of homemade pork fennel sausage, panna (cream), scallions and red onions is a perfect example of something I\'d order again and again (and again). I usually like tomato-based pizzas more, but give this one a go and I promise you won\'t regret it! 
Truly unbelievably delicious snack. Sorry, Miss Piggy.
They\'ve got the best pizza crust, crispy and fluffy/doughy at the same time. The thickness is just right I can finish 3/4 of one pizza without feeling too full üôäüôä tried the Funghi misti (fontina, taleggio &amp; thyme) and Bacon, salame (fennel sausage, pancetta, tomato &amp; mozzarella). Both recommended by the staff and they were really really good. I don\'t think I\'ll ever eat pizza in any random place anymore after this. 
Pictures suxx I concur but the food is absolute party in your mouth like you still 22 , must try avocado asparagus and cauliflower fritti
Pardon me for the picture, but the dark setting of Pizzeria Mozza was not made for taking pictures with your phone. After long contemplation on our pizza choice, we decided on Salame Picante with salami, mozzarella, tomato &amp; fresh red chili. I love the thin crust of the pizzas here, rather than the crispy crust types, though I must say, the center became slightly soggy and the toppings kept falling off as we picked up the slices of pizza. Nevertheless, the taste pretty much made up for any inconvenience. I love how amazing the cheese here tasted, and the chili and spiced salami complemented the dish really well without being too spicy but just a little kick. 
Such a simple antipasti but oh so delicious! Sweet asparagus, wrapped with smoky flavored prosciutto and topped with generous amount of parmigiano shavings. Loved every bite of it, especially the the cheese shavings that melt in your mouth with intense burst of flavor. Mmm. 
Lovely portion of roasted bone marrow that melts in your mouth served with super buttery crostini and roasted soft garlic. Absolutely fattening but melting goodness bursting with flavor!
Prosciutto di Parma, rucola, tomato &amp; mozzarella pizza ($31++). One can see the dough been made on the spot.
I think they put wine inside the dough. Awesomeeeeee~ Next time we shall just get Margarita.
Something different from the usual ham/seafood! Fennel sausage was flavourful and really fragrant cause of the fennel and spices. Love how the mozzarella slices added richness to this otherwise clean-tasting pizza because... how can a pizza be satisfying without cheese?! The crust was airy and soft, more like a pan pizza (bread-like) than the usual thin crust. I still prefer my pizzas cheesy and rich, but this isn\'t bad for a change :)
Time and time again, it\'s the only pizza which last bits of crusts I\'ll finish off. Nancy Silverton has it right with this tedious but amazing pizza dough. Try the Yukon potato pizza with hints of truffle, salty pancetta and sexily runny egg yolk. Do try out the must-eat burrata, crispy pig\' ears and the garlic prawns. Always leave me wanting more (despite the busted tummies) üòç
Some say eww, I saw wow!! Don\'t knock em till you try em! The subtle hints of olive oil in this ice cream makes such a beautiful balance of sweet and savory. With an added buttery waffle biscuits, triple check! Sweet, savory, crunchy! Oh and creamy! üòç I\'d forget their classic butterscotch budino and order their caramel copetta and olive oil ice cream instead. You won\'t regret it üëå
At Pizzeria Mozza, it\'s all about the crust. Think a thick, airy, chewy crust surrounding a thin center filled with fresh toppings. Topping combinations here are unique, and they have several types of cheeses, herbs and meats. Go for their funghi pizza; it\'s generously topped with mushrooms and fontina. Be prepared to wait for your pizzas though!
.\n<br /> üòÅ\n<br />.
Like a banana version of mudpie, this has gelato on a chocolate biscuit base, topped with hot fudge and my favourite bit - candied hazelnuts. üòã 
Far too saccharine, this lacked the zip and zing I was hoping for.
Om nom nom nom nom. 
Friday special: seafoods something!! Lol Because the foods here are too good that I forgot the name liao!! Haha... Bon App√®tit
Bacon, salami, fennel sausage, pancetta, tomato &amp; mozzarella. Those bacon are super juicy too!!
Red snapper with a tomato based sauce mixed with pine nuts, olives and potatoes. The advice of the waitress was to eat this fish without the skin as the skin would have been too salty for our liking. Even though Mozza is famous for their pizzas, the Pesce Al Forno was packed with flavour and while not spectacular, is still worth a try if you happen to be there. Also, this dish is only available on Wednesdays so plan your visit to Mozza in advance! 
Not only do they serve the best pizzas, but I always ALWAYS save room for heir desserts. Caramel Copetta is my go-to order with caramel ice cream, buttery waffle biscuits, a dollop of marshmallow cream sprinkled with salted peanuts and more caramel sauce. Drown me in caramel! 
Overall the pizza $27++ is good, a bit oily though... Butterscotch butino $16++ is yummy..will come back next time. ;)
$30. Full of mushrooms, pretty enjoyable. Still prefer the one with fennel sausage, though.
AMAZING
Best pizza in Singapore, hands down.
Can\'t remember the exact name of the pizza, but it was so damn good! Thin base, crispy crust &amp; filled with cheese. 
And my favorite Pizza... at Pizzeria Mozza! This one is just incredible! 
The classic combination of pork and fennel takes centre stage in this panna-based pizza with scallions and red onions. One of my favourite pizzas here!
Soft, flavourful meat balls with a marinara base begging to be mopped up with the buttery and herby toast! 
Burrata cheese is one my biggest weaknesses and this classic trinity of pesto, tomato and soft cheese is just impossible to say no to. And the roasted tomatoes burst in the mouth and flood it with sweet and savoury juices!
One of the best pizza I should say especially when you are able to see them baking the pizzas in the oven over firewood. Love the light, chewy and airy texture of the crust and will never get sick of it. Their generous servings of the ingredients on the pizza makes it even more value for money. Definitely worth the try! 
What Mozza beckons you to do - save room for dessert. Would totally go back there for their FOUR MEATS PIZZA. Jizz in your pants goodness
Somewhat pricey at $32++, but with extremely rich flavours to match the price.
Never thought i\'d eat raw eggs on pizza. There you go!
Super yummy spicy chicken wings cooked in the traditional pizza oven... Had a hard time eating it with my utensils though üç¥
Only available on tue, this crispy duck tasted amazing with tender meat and tasty lentils. 
Awesome calamari, for that extra kick, stuff one whole piece in your mouth and chew non-stop for 5 mins
Simply amazing flavors. Bone marrow al forno. Lovely birthday dinner with @abelliea.
Have to say this is one of the best pizza I\'ve tried in Singapore. I can taste the red wine in the sauce, and the thin crust is a delight.
Tear-worthy. 
Delicious! Soft and kinda melts on your tongue.
3-in-a-plate for $18. Price on the high side but taste yummy though. Was served with an empty bowl to put the bones.
A pizza with pizzazz: funghi misti, fontina, taleggio &amp; thyme. Love the base here.
Specially air-flown from Italy by restaurant and not found anywhere else in Singapore. Taste like? Soda water with lemon :)

Perfect tiramisu with strong alcohol flavour to end our meal.
Chef Kara and her team at Pizzeria Mozza came with two wonderful desserts.  One is a Roasted Cherry Compote topped with Ice Cream. The other is one of the industry\'s best kept secret combo, Blueberries and Lemon Curd. In this case, the Chef made it into a tart. Simple yet high in gratification and satiety is what makes these desserts really lovable.
