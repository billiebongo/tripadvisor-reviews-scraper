Part of the upcoming #SGCocktailWeek, they\'ll also be offering up a crash course for beginners on #whiskey. Learn about barrel aging, rickhouses, cocktails, how to differentiate between aged and non-aged. You’ll also get to do some bottle waxing and take one home! Happening 17 Mar 2016.
POACHED EGG drenched in Bearnaise sauce, lying deductively upon a bed of salmon gravlax, asparagus and arugula salad. Poking it gently released a stream of golden river that could leave anyone screaming for joy!
No doubt abt it that Manhattan bar is one of my fav bar in town. To die for desserts (cheesecake here is da bomb) with fantastic cocktails is simply a perfect marriage for a fun night out.
One of our favorite cocktail bars, Manhattan\'s newly launched Harlem menu is a spanking array of the spirit-driven cocktails we appreciate.
Chef introduced this item on the new Hell\'s Kitchen district menu in this fashion: minced pork something something... soft-boiled quail egg something something... with potato something something... fried in Knickerbocker beer batter... with Irish whiskey sauce.
Inspired by Sylvester Stallone\'s portrayal of Robert \'Rocky\' Balboa, don\'t let the Spectrum Punch fool you. Made with Plantation Jamaica rum, house-made falernum (a spice-kissed sweet syrup), fresh lime, honey and fresh berries, this Tiki tipple from the Hell\'s Kitchen menu may look like a \'girly drink\' but it sure packs a mighty wallop! \n<br />Easy to drink, yes, but pretty damn potent too. 
The launch of Manhattan\'s new Hell\'s Kitchen district menu last week was such a hit that\'s we\'ve already been back for seconds!
They served the left glass first, and in manner of Awkward Penguin I asked how come the glass was empty. \"Have you heard of The Emperor\'s New Clothes?\" was the reply, and then the distillation flask which held the goodies was brought out.
Soft, fluffy pillow of fried dough with a lightly crisp glaze of bacon-infused maple syrup, crowned with crunchy crystals of bacon and served with fragrant espresso cream sauce. This is gold.
Was at Manhattan yesterday night for a preview of their new Hell\'s Kitchen district menu (launching today!), and I swear my eyes were gleaming when I saw this.
The cocktails are really memorably different, and in some cases really intense! This is one of the milder ones, the Omertà - Luxardo Angioletto hazelnut, Mina Real mezcal, fresh lemon, sugar and walnut bitters - which is the gustatory equivalent of a American man\'s tobacco-tinged passionate liplock.
A spin off the Manhattan, this cocktail on the newly launched Manhattan\'s \"Hell\'s Kitchen\" menu is set to revive you from your Monday (work) stupor.
Flashback to a night of catching up, sharing experiences and receiving unexpected surprises from very lovely and thoughtful people. Manhattan Bar is truly all sorts of magical!
This one is strictly for the adults. Sunday brunch ($150++) at the Manhattan Bar at Regent Singapore is no doubt a feast fit for kings (and queens). Just stepping inside says it all — the decor is grand but welcoming, luxurious, and elegant. Live out those dreams of decadent Sunday brunches slurping down freshly shucked oysters, scooping up smoked foie gras, tucking into various cheeses, smearing your bagels, cutting into fluffy pancakes... The list goes on. You can expect very good cocktails to go with your food — you\'ll even get to customise your Bloody Mary with your favourite hot sauce and garnishes. Of course, a cocktail brunch isn\'t complete without boozy desserts! 
My favouritest cocktail at @manhattan_sg Manhattan Bar Sunday cocktail brunch! I wish I can have a glass of this now to beat the sweltering heat. 💦😖 #EileenWantsToCampHere #Cocktail #Brunch #Drink #FSTaste #FourSeasons #ManhattanSG #RegentSingapore #SundayBrunch
If you could only have one cocktail (but why??) here, make it the Eighth Ward ($24++) - a riff on the classic Ward 8 -, where the layered flavours of Scotch-blend High West Campfire Whiskey are unravelled by a chorus of fruity &amp; citrusy notes from Sangue Morlacco, Ferrand Dry Curaçao, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, and orange peel. The result: A smooth, heady, and extremely easy-to-down tipple.
Not @manhattan_sg and me definitely. 😍😍😍 #ManhattanSG #EileenWantsToCampHere #Chocolate #Bacon #Burpple #Sunday #Brunch
Includes a welcome tipple and Raines sandwich. Great start to any evening. 😉
I only had two servings ok, super guai le. 😂😂 This is like 95% fats! 😍 My favourite food group!OH!Happy one year anniversary to @manhattan_sg !!Cheers to many more years!! 🍸🍹🍻🍷🍺 .\n<br />|\n<br />#EileenWantsToCampHere #FatFatMeatSeries #ManhattanSg #RegentSingapore #Brunch #FoieGras #Buffet
.\n<br />|\n<br />Among all the cakes and pastries, my favorite was the pop corn wrapped with a \"newspaper\". While watching the bartender doing their magic, I was at the front seat pop-ing them one after another!
The cod was so perfect that it literally fell apart in my mouth. Together with the fried fish skin, the contrast texture made the dish so interesting.
Not only they are well known for their cocktail, their Sunday brunch also serve a wide variety of dishes. Free flow of cocktails, beer, seafood, cheese and hot dishes. Excellent service and seriously good food!
One of my favorite cocktails to start with, this bittersweet concoction of champagne, fresh berries, grapefruit, basil and peach bitters is a medley of fruity flavors with a short finish. The usual dryness of champagne doesn\'t exist here, thanks to Head Bartender, Ricky Paiva\'s clever addition of what we refer to as \"a little happiness\". If you really must know, the name\'s St. George absinthe. Be warned, this discreetly potent cocktail is more than meets the eye. Expect fun times ahead.
Dreaming of these mouthwatering, warm and crisp churros (it\'s new on the menu!) that I had last week at Manhattan Bar. Served alongside a warm melty chocolate dip, these babies have warmed my stomach and found its way to my heart—for good! Looks like I\'m gonna have to pop by soon to satisfy that craving! 😁

Again, crispy goodness. 😍😍 #instasg #manhattansg #regentsingapore .\n<br />|\n<br />I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness of this shot despite the low light setting in the room. 6 plus for the win lah!😍😍
😍😍 Won this in the photo contest took place during the instameet itself. Main ingredients - Roasted tomatoes, Gin, house-made steak sauce and coriander. Love the savoury twist of this cocktail, with a hint of subtle heat. Definitely the most creative cocktail ever!! Thank you Ricky @rawdogrick again!! #instasg #manhattansg #regentsingapore
|\n<br />Ode to Eggs (Lower East Side - $10) .\n<br />|\n<br />A dessert which looked like a breakfast dish. Egg white and topped with passion fruit purée. The toast gave the dish an crispy texture which created a breakfast-like experience\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />This is a bar which I will visit again! .\n<br />|\n<br />Manhattan\n<br />The Regent Singapore, 2nd floor, 1 Cuscaden Rd.

|\n<br />Need I explain more? The spicy jerky sauce penetrated the frenched drumettes making them tender and spicy. I could easily finish this dish alone!!! 😋😋😋\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />The small downsides were the drumettes were a little over-done and the mango salad was over-powered by the onions.
|\n<br />Prickles battered and deep fried. It tasted a bit like sour cream chips. The chef created two different dips - green capsicum and chive (I think). I loved the idea that the chef prepared the spicy dip because we as Asian loved our food spicy!!!
The kitchen constantly worked together with the bar to create different combination\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Sad to say this many places served good drinks but their food was either too common or just cant make it. BUT this is the place where good food and drinks come together. .\n<br />|\n<br />From top left hand corner clockwise \n<br />Vegetable Crudités Chips (Theater District - $12) \n<br />The dipping was good but I was more interested in the chips. Because frying root veg with such high starch content wasn\'t easy, as the chips were easily turned dark. The chef finely sliced and soft boiled root veg then fried them right before serving. The even more interesting part was that the chips still remained crispy after surviving a series of photobomb. ** I would recommend the chef to use lotus root, it will make it even more interesting\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Smoked Marlin Dip (Lower East Side - $18) \n<br />Smoked marlin mash served on fried plantain topped with caviar. For those who were afraid of the fishy smell, this dish might take you awhile to get use to\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Pork Cracklings (Spanish Harlem - $12) \n<br />Personally I find the crackling slightly too hard and under seasoned. If they were in smaller pieces, they might not be so hard. .\n<br />|\n<br />Churros (Spanish Harlem - $12) \n<br />Sadly we took so many pictures that we didn\'t got to try it.
|\n<br />This was my favorite drink among all of them. You could slowly pour the flower extract into the drink and watched it turned pink. The visual impact was more than impressive. The hint of flowery taste made it very unique\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Manhattan\n<br />The Regent Singapore, 2nd floor, 1 Cuscaden Rd. Singapore, 249715 \n<br />Tel: +65 6725 3377\n<br />Opening Hours: 5pm – 1am (Daily) Violet hour: 5pm – 7pm (Mon – Fri)\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />** Personal Suggestion: I would prefer the extract to be thicker. Thus while the extract been poured, distortion in the drink could be more obvious (increase in the visual effect).
|\n<br />Thanks to @eileenongxt for letting me to take this picture. .\n<br />|\n<br />They customized this drink for her because of her love for roasted meat\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Smokiness from the Bak Kwa, Sourness from the tomato juice (I think is tomato), salt and pepper to finish off this savory drink\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />The pepper gave the drink a warm sensation which make it very interesting.
|\n<br />The bartender carefully placed two strand of lemon zest on the top of the ice. Thus, while the drink was been poured, the zest infused it with even more lemon flavor\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />I chose a very strong light. Trying to capture the light flowing through the drink and forcing its way out of the glass. Because of the pattern of the glass, the entire drink looked a big Citrine glowing in the dark.
Even after finishing the entire glass, I didn\'t felt any heaviness. ** The drink itself looked like a bartender. The basil leave acting like a towel over the shoulder. (just for fun)\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Primavera (Upper East Side - $20)\n<br />One of the most refreshing drinks. The pineapple gave this drink a topical feel. It was served with the coolest straw ever! (Strainer + Straw) .\n<br />|\n<br />Singapura Nacional ($23) \n<br />An award winning drink which represent Singapore. The bartender adding droplets of bitter which gave the drink another layer of complexity. .\n<br />|\n<br />Penicillin (Lower East Side - $23)\n<br />Lemon based drinks, strongest among all of them. A hint of smokiness was found at the aftertaste which increased the maturity of the taste.
Creme De Violette(contain blue pea flower extract) which changes colour after reacting with the warm cocktail. So PRETTY!A joy to drink this too!All cheers to the head bartender @rawdogrick!Thank you @instasg and @manhattan_sg at @regentsingapore for hosting us! #manhattansg #instasg\n<br />|\n<br />Thank you @fatboygoodeats for being the awesome hand model/adviser/consultant!
Apricot brandy with housemade gooseberry syrup! Yes the cocktails are as inventive as they come.
This could the night cap for your date night. Exclusive and fantastic cocktails. Call for a reservation before coming to ensure your seats. You won\'t regret it!
Beautifully constructed and concocted. No wonder eve gave into temptation. #foodporn #manhattanbar #sugarrush
Pimento cheese, jalepenos, corn. Alas, friday makes so much sense. #manhattanbar #foodporn
The angus beef patty with tomato onion jam and Nicasio cheese between spicy paprika buns is pretty fine, but what really captured my heart was the vegetarian slider, which featured an unexpectedly tasty quinoa and lentils patty. Trust @manhattan_sg to be the first establishment to make me vote veggies over meat. 
Not just any ordinary crisps, these Idaho potato chips are made even more spectacular with a pan-fried onion dip enriched with foie gras. So addictive that I kept going back to these in between the dishes I was served during my tasting. 
Free-flow of this yummilicious, fun-sized pork cheek burger assembled with paprika buns and coleslaw if you\'re at @manhattan_sg\'s Sunday cocktail brunch right now! 
Nothing gets my taste buds screaming (for joy) quite like the combination of sharp acidity and punchy spice – this one had me excited with lemon juice-cured shrimp cosying up with a dab of creamy avocado and Bloody Mary cocktail sauce in a crispy wonton \"taco\" shell. 😍 
If you\'re heading to Manhattan for their first installment of the Sunday cocktail brunch, make sure you sample all five of their homemade cream cheeses: salmon, blueberry, sundried tomatoes, blue cheese, and herb &amp; chive. My favourite combo has gotta be the toasted onion bagel, slathered with blue cheese and garnished with blackforest ham and shaved asparagus. 
Topped with caramelised apples and bourbon maple syrup, this is just one of the many free-flow treats – foie gras, lobster, pork sliders, countless desserts! – that are part of the new Sunday cocktail brunch at @manhattansg, starting this weekend.
Light and refreshing, this bourbon cocktail is sweetened with ginger-apple syrup, and brightened with fresh lemon and mint. What a treat with that little sidekick of sticky, sweet house-popped popcorn. 
Some kind of epic: moist brownie cake in a shell of chocolate and chopped nuts, with an airy dipping cream of espresso-infused chantilly.  
It\'s like being transported back to old New York - grand and luxuriant, this place just oozes golden age elegance. Think, The Great Gatsby. Here, there is celebration of New York\'s diversity through their meticulously-presented and delectable bites, and drinks are made in honour of classic cocktails. Even the ice cubes are stamped with the classy Manhattan logo! With its grand hotel bar splendour and fancy dark furnishing, you would want to dress for the occasion. 
Selection of bar bites from Manhattan. Which one caught your fancy?
Checking out Manhattan Bar, inspired by old New York in decor, with cocktails, burgers and Shrimp Ceviche Taco.
There\'s a new bar in town, and it wins by a long mile. Extremely impressed with the aged spirits, brilliantly mixed drinks, superb and well thought food menu, immaculate service and overall ambience. #addictions #drinks #nocturnalactivities #speakeasy #honesty #revelations  #guiltypleasures

Too bad it was dark and the iPhone7 could not capture the drink turning pink when the liquid in the vial was poured in.\n<br />•\n<br />🍹: Aviation ($23) - This is a version by Manhattan’s Head Bartender Ricky Paiva which comes in two components: a concoction of Citadelle Gin, Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur and fresh lemon juice with a tiny vial containing crème de violette mixed with bluepea flowers.\n<br />•\n<br />#ig #igsg #manhattanbar #manhattanbarsg #regenthotel #aviation #cocktail #weekday #afterworkdrinks #catchingup #floralcocktails #prettycocktails #citadellegin #luxardomaraschino #liquer #cremedeviolette #bluepeaflower #burpple
Salmon is cured in red cabbage juice to acquire that pretty purple rim, this then sits atop a crispy bagel chip to be topped off with homemade cream cheese dip in heaping amounts. The ultimate moreish snack to be paired with their new line-up of cocktails representing the Chelsea and Central Park districts in NYC.
Seriously thirsting for this trophy of a #cocktail from @Manhattan_SG @RegentSingapore that comes topped with gold caramel popcorn - \'cause who doesn\'t want to feel like a champion?

Philip, the charming and very dapper manager, mans a special room that\'s like a shrine to the classic cocktail. Here\'s where guests can customise their Bloody Mary\'s starting with their choice of alcohol from the variety on offer (pisco, vodka, gin... you name it, he\'s likely to have it). After which the tomato juice is splashed on - that itself is unique from the addition of bits and bobs. A crazy assortment of hot sauces, powders (Philip describes them as \"dehydrated parfum\") and salts are available for flavouring the drink according to your preference. Lastly, you can use whatever you like from the spread of garnishes to dress up your cocktail. Apparently, it\'s hard to exercise restraint because I saw quite a few Bloody Mary\'s looking all Carmen Miranda-like. 😏😁 Thanks @manhattansg for hosting us today, and as always, thanks @burpple for the invitation.

This drink delivers a cocky Chun Li-esque 百裂脚 (Hyakuretsukyaku, or Lightning Kick) to the noggin with just one sip, so only experienced degenerate drunks should apply.
If you\'re looking for a new spot or drinks to try, @Manhattan_SG @RegentSingapore has a new, and delicious, \'Harlem\' menu of savouries and #cocktails.
POTATO LATKES with chives, smeared with sour cream and caviar! The \'pancakes\' were slightly salty and mushy which I gladly soaked them up with the flowy yolk leaking sexily from the poached egg (another dish).\n<br />Both breakfast items were fantastic, complementing each other like Adam and Eve, yin and yang 😘 .
FILET MIGNON, one of the best cuts I like, laid atop yummy mushroom ragout and butternut squash purée that was so smooth and creamy 🐄. Love my beef medium rare and especially how it was surprisingly not chewy but tender enough given it\'s doneness! Every mouthful was simply umami.
Another round of innovative, handcrafted #cocktails and food inspired by the vibrant neighbourhood, teamed with classic New York soul food and Southern comforts.
George Raspberry Liqueur, Hibiscus Syrup, Lime Juice, Cucumber, Mint Leaves and Ginger Beer; all for a cool $23 buckaroos。
Deep fried drumettes with waffle encased around it, served with honeycomb and heavy lashings of house-made hot sauce for maximum gratification. Super delish if you ask me。\n<br />♡♡♡♡♡\n<br />#8dayseat #i8mondays #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple #ManhattanBar #ManhattanSG #regentSingapore #barbites #chickenandwaffles #hungrygowhere #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders

Please do not ask me what the individual components are, I really have no idea. 😂😅What I do know is this - My favourite cocktail of the night as it was not as strong as the others, making it quite easy to drink. \n<br />This cocktail is part of the new district menu at @manhattan_sg - Hell\'s Kitchen. I have always love this place since my first visit!😘 Cheers to being the 8th Best Bar in Asia Pacific and 7th Best Hotel Bar in the world! Too awesome!

I love bar bites, but I love even more when bars serve food that\'s lovingly and painstakingly conceptualized, made to equal and reflect the perfection in their cocktails. Manhattan has both booze and bites nailed – definitely the place you want to get happy in spirit and in stomach.
