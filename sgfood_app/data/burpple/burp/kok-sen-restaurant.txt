Was looking thru Burpple guides Zi Char places and decided to try the big prawn hor fun at this old school coffeeshop. Prawns were fresh, hor fun full of wok hei taste and the gravy makes its even more shiok! 
‚Ä¢\n<br />Each bowl comes with several massive prawns that have been conveniently halved and slippery white beehoon all drowned in that umami rich broth. Serving size was also very generous. Highly recommended!
This no-frills zi char eatery in Chinatown took the number one spot on our Hot 100 (Hawker Edition) 2016 with their perfectly cooked Big Prawn Hor Fun (from $16) brimming with wok hei. The crowd favourite dish sees slippery rice noodles bathed in an eggy, slightly spicy sauce that is full of flavour. Seats fill up really quickly at peak hours, so best to come early. Consider it your lucky day if you\'ve managed to snap up the Claypot Yong Tau Foo ($14), which is often sold out. Pair your Hor Fun with other tasty eats like the Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Egg (from $11) and the Homemade Tofu with Minced Pork ($10) ‚Äî both are consistently good options that our Burpple community recommends. \n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person \n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Kelly Wong
Signature dish of this zi char, this never fails. The spicy soup, every mouth of broth screams prawn! Perfect combi of Tender fresh prawns, thick bee hoon, flavourful spicy broth, vege.. more please (side: recommend this over the dry version)
Seasonal dish (1st time having this at the zi char i had patronised for the nth time) simple and good, tender, fresh fish, thou not the best, its simple and good
Kok Sen at Keong Saik serves up an awesome Claypot Yong Taufoo, coming in a sizzling pot with savoury gravy. \n<br />The handmade shrimp pieces and brinjal are my favourite. \n<br />Note: order this early as it always get sold out. \n<br />My friends and I were discussing if Kok Sen would ever get a Michelin star, I don\'t think it is impossible, though for selfish reasons, I won\'t want to. Cos then it would be Super crowded. As if it is already not. \n<br />But Kok Sen, I think you used to taste a little better. Just saying #DFDMichelin #DFDhawker
($14/$21/$28)
This saucy noodle has been a consistent order for me since first visiting Kok Sen years ago. I typically go for the classic horfun noodle but, my brother visiting Singapore loves egg noodles and wanted to try this version. 
Kok Sen Restaurant is a heritage restaurant with almost 50 years of history. They are famous for their zi char although I find the dishes a little pricey. The restaurant becomes very packed after 6pm so reservation is strongly recommended. Please read my full review at www.hungryghost.sg
A different taste of hor fun. Prawns were really fresh. Love the Bittergourd beef I requested too that\'s not on the menu. \n<br />Gotta go real early. We\'re there at 5.30pm and it\'s almost full.
Kok Sen Resturant is a zhi char place in two shops along Keong Siak Road. It serve very good Cantonese dishes and this is one of them. For $16 you get two big prawns sliced into halves and lots of greens. The wok hei is constantly good and the sambal and eggy gravy really top it all. Yummy yummy yum yum yum.

Went to Kok Sen for lunch, luckily the queue wasn\'t too long given Christmas period. Ordered the smallest Prawn Hor Fun for $16 (enough for two small eaters) given all the raves on burpple and instagram. We also ordered a small portion of har cheong kai (prawn paste chicken)  and fish noodle soup. The Hor Fun is a pretty unique dish with fragrant super rich prawn gravy, generous amounts of large prawns and bright crunchy greens. You can taste the wok hei in the noodles too. Only criticism is the prawns are slightly overcooked and a little powdery. It\'s quite a rich dish on its own so you may need to order other lighter dishes to balance out the meal. The har cheong kai was pretty average (won\'t order next time) but the fish noodles were yum too!! 8/10 overall. Will return.
Good as usual üëç total bill $158 include drinks. Claypot YTF, Prawn HorFun, Cereal Sotong, FuYong Omelette, Porkchop üëë, Prawn paste chicken and Spinach with trio eggs.
Loved the wok hei and fragrant sambal sauce, and the prawns were really quite big and juicy! Also liked how the kailan was cooked till it was amazingly tender. #burpple #foodcoma #tgif
Pictured foreground is the big prawn hor fun cooked in sambal-ish sauce. It\'s spiciness is exciting and somewhat challenging for me in the hot and humid weather (read: sweating buckets). Is it too spicy? Not really. Think of it like your sambal fried rice. The Hor Fun was extremely delectable, with a good amount of fragrance and \'wok hey\'. The gravy itself is kinda on the saltier side though (quite generous on the MSG, I think).  Ingredients are also quite substantial, the fresh prawns are so satisfying. A great dish! Perfect for a cool weather day. 
I missed you so big prawn ee mian from Kok Sen! My ex department used to visit this restaurant for our annual Chinese New Year dinner or departmental dinner. Expect a long queue starting after 6.30pm, thus do come early or you may want to try reserving a table.
Black bean braised bitter gourd and pork ribs! Perfect dish to a bowl of fluffy rice!
PRICE: Big prawn hor fun $16 (not enough for 2 persons to share on its own) \n<br />Canned drinks $1.50
3 munchies: Between this and the Big Prawn Hor Fun (each priced at $16 for the smallest portion), I\'d go for the 5-munchie latter anytime. The savoury-spicy broth was a tad light for my liking and lacked sweetness from the prawn shells, which was disappointing since the large prawns were fresh and succulent. Served with thick bee hoon and sprinkled with red cut chillies and fried shallots, it would have been a banging dish had the broth been more flavoursome.

Big prawn hor fun - umami! Generally the dishes we had were pretty good! Even though we sitting at a table at the back alley, the breeze in the open compensated for the atmosphere! Will be back!
Finally, I managed to get my hands on it after placing a pre-order prior to going there. At $14 for the smallest portion, this Claypot Yong Tau Foo can be a tad expensive for many with just a few pieces of yong tau foo in a thick brown sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />Stuffed with a mixture of fresh prawn and fish paste, that were the only positive points about this dish. The sauce lacks a certain oomph, plus the fact that I do not eat the stuffed chilli, eggplant or capsicum, it was quite an overrated dish for me and am scratching my head why is this dish so popular?\n<br />.\n<br />Kok Sen Restaurant\n<br />Address: 30, Keong Siak Road, Singapore 089137
An innovative yet very tasty dish. I\'ve always love Kok Sen dishes as they have good \"wok hei\". This dish is definitely a winner in more ways than one. It\'s a great combination of sambal shiok, great wok hei smell and fresh big prawn. Super yummy yummy yum yum yum! Posted by Ah Leong San 2016 May 24. 
The wok hei in this dish is REAL folks! Extremely fragrant, it ain\'t your average hor fun. The gravy is laden with the taste of prawns and fried shallots, making the entire dish slurp worthy. \n<br />Do come early though, as part of the experience is a chaotic mess of a queue and confused diners. We got lucky and shared a table (and made a friend! Hi @msginginly ). Will have to come back again as we missed out on their Claypot Yong Tau Foo which was already sold out at ard 630 üò≠üò≠üò≠ 
Almost a staple on everyone\'s table, the Big Prawns Beehoon Soup ($16/$32/$48) and Big Prawns Horfun ($16/$32/$48) are hot favorites here at Kok Sen. I prefer the horfun for the thick, eggy, flavorful and slightly spicy sauce that coats onto the wide rice noodles. \n<br />You can probably skip the weekends only special Golden Dragon Chicken ($32) ‚Äî fish paste fried with chicken skin, which wasn\'t that worthy of its price tag.
The thick googey sauce in the hor fun just doesn\'t appeal to me and it felt like a chilli crab dish. However, the light but slightly spicy broth for this is more to my liking. As usual, prawns were huge and very fresh but it would be best to eat this dish in an air-conditioned room because you will be sweating buckets.\n<br />.\n<br />Kok Sen Restaurant\n<br />Address: 30, Keong Siak Road, Singapore 089137
If you ever do visit, don\'t even think, just get this in your belly. Bad service didn\'t matter after because I seriously couldn\'t think straight after eating this. (8.8/10)
5 munchies: Large prawns, slightly charred hor fun slathered in a thick gravy that was infused with strong wok hei aroma ‚Äì this is what a good zichar dish is all about. Resembling somewhat like a chilli crab sauce, I was already craving for more after wiping the plate clean with none of the mild-spicy, eggy sauce left.
The signature: Big Prawn Hor Fun ($16).\n<br />Delish and worth a try for its wok-hei flavour and sauce that is slightly spicy sauce that is reminiscent of chilli crab, though it didn\'t cut as blowing fantastic. We came early to beat the queues, but there weren\'t much. Guess Sunday lunches are a pretty good time to try, otherwise be prepped for the long waits here
Oh my..the gravy was so thick and absorbed all the prawn stocks, which felt as if having a thick prawn noodle soup essence! Furthermore, there was wok hei flavour and bits of red chilli to spice you up! \n<br />It has been 8 months since we last met and all of us have new work environment now. Still, nothing beats the joy of bringing up our past stories and fun when we were working together! #ÊàëÁöÑÂ•∂ÊØîË•øÁìúÈáç
This is truly happiness in a plate. The hor fun sauce is close to chilli crab gravy. Full of flavour :sweet chilli\'s mild spiciness.
Okay, I meant wok hei actually.
Our famished tummies were screaming in anticipating upon seeing the waiter serving our order of Prawn Paste Chicken ($12). Not the usual har cheong gai that you can get from elsewhere, instead of the usual drumsticks and winglets, Kok Sen uses the different chicken parts. Meat was tender and well marinated as the prawn paste flavour was very distinct. Pairing it with their tangy chilli and you will know why there‚Äôs a thumbs up for this dish in their menu. Only downside was that it was slightly salty for me as the chef might have gone a tad too heavy on the seasoning.
I hardly find them these days and it‚Äôs a pity that such an excellent plate of noodles will be lost in our food memory soon.
The Big Prawn Hor Fun (from $16) is what draws diners time and again to this Chinatown zi char stalwart. Redolent with wok hei, the winning dish sees slippery rice noodles bathed in an eggy, slightly spicy sauce that is full on flavour, and the prawns are as advertised ‚Äî large and succulent. If it\'s available, don\'t hesitate to snap up the Claypot Yong Tau Foo ($14), which is often sold out. Other tasty eats include the Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Egg (from $11) and Homemade Tofu with Minced Pork ($10) ‚Äî both are consistently good options that should sit well with both young and old. Call ahead to reserve a table, so you don‚Äôt end up crowding the sidewalk while queuing for seats.\n<br />Avg price: $15 per person
Yummy juicy prawn noodles perfect for two! The soup is so sedap üòã, I\'m craving for it again as I type.... 
This sure live up to its hype ! So does the claypot yong tau foo!!!! 
Not the most visually appealing but definitely one of the best.
Â§ßËôæÊªëËõãÊ≤≥Á≤â „Äã$16
Was a little sad to hear that there were no big prawns available for the hor fun when we went, but the nice auntie reassured us that she\'ll compensate with an extra medium-sized one. üòÅ \n<br />While the hor fun\'s gravy packed some serious flavour + wok hei punch, the claypot yong tau fu was our unanimous favourite ‚Äî eggplant, capsicum and chilli stuffed generously with well-seasoned homemade fish and prawn paste arrived in a moat of thick, slurp-worthy gravy. We\'re not surprised this gets sold out very fast.
At first I was quite skeptical about the Big Prawn Hor Fun ($16/small) because who pays that much for the smallest portion of horfun at a zi char stall?! I was so wrong. This inconspicuous-looking hor fun worths every single cent!
Unique dish with the very addictive gravy of Chilli with lots of eggs! 
If you\'re hungry and in the Duxton area, head straight for this messy, brimming plate of Big Prawn Hor Fun ($16, good for 3-4). The rich gravy is full of umami, super prawn-y, and just a tiny bit spicy. The prawns are, well, big and so very succulent ‚Äî well worth the price and the wait and you\'ll want to bring anyone you know here.
A delish, piping hot bowl of YTF! Eggplant, capsicum, tofu puffs stuffed with a home made squid and prawn paste, braised in a thick, savoury gravy.
A savoury, sweet, spicy gravy, thick with egg, and noodles that carry smoky wok hei. Even better than the meaty, juicy prawns within!
Probably the best thing they have there.  The rich gravy was the clincher for me, infused with umami goodness of prawn stock.  Overall, I felt that KEK had better quality overall and Sik Bao Sin wins in the Wok Hei department.
Grateful for this hot and messy, gravy-laden huge plate of Big Prawn Hor Fun that tastes every bit as good as it looks!! üòçüòòüëçüèª One of Kok Sen Tze Char\'s signature dishes - an all-time favourite! Easily feeds 4 - 5... or go ahead hoard it all for yourself!
Late to the party, I know. But finally tried Kok Sen and this brimming plate of gravy-laden hor fun with fresh, succulent prawns is so worth the wait (and calories). Tried the prawn omelette too and although it could have been less oily, it was the bomb diggity üòã 
Bittergourd Braised Pork Ribs with Black Bean Sauce more as the ingredients are braised long enough to create that umami robust flavours. Cooked till soft, the bittergourd is mildly bitter infused with the rich flavours of black bean sauce.
A good balance of sweet and sour, though certain pieces seemed to be a tad fatty somehow.
The most outstanding dish that we had at Kok Sen. A pretty unique rendition because big prawns are pretty rare in Hor Fun, which they were succulent and fresh in here while the sauce of the Hor Fun ain\'t the usual type; its savoury with wokhei and comes with specks of chili that spikes it with moderate spiciness. A dish that lives true to the recommendations.
Pretty ordinary; rather crisp but points deducted for the slight hint of overused oil in the omelette; a no-no for good tze char omelette. Still fairly enjoyable for those who are not too picky though.
Rather strange because they arrived pretty much cut up instead of full wings. Prawn paste was evident but there seemed to be a lurking aftertaste that suggests overused oil within.
This goes pretty well with rice and i quite enjoyed it.
Ordered some signature dishes - prawn hor fun, yong tau foo &amp; prawn paste chicken.
At the coffeeshop on Keong Saik rd, opp The Pinnacle. Strongest wok hei (smoky flavor) evah, every ingredient was tasty and well flavored. You can easily finish every part of this.üòã
Not the normal prawn noodles that we have because it doesnt cook with pork ribs so it is lighter in taste. And just look at those roes in the king prawns. For 2 to share because i couldnt finish this by myself. \n<br />#koksen #prawnnoodles #sgfood #instafoodsg #burpple #igsg
Assorted beancurd, eggplant, capsicums stuffed with fish &amp; prawn paste drenched with a brown braising sauce.
Not enough wok hei and beef tasted off. Prefer por kee instead.
Always trusted to deliver the most delectable flavours to my taste buds. I can never make out what goes into the gravy but there is clearly a good amount of shallot and based on a solid prawn broth. Prawns are always the big fresh Angkas. Delightful and must try if you are still clueless
This is SOGOOD! Â§ßËôæÊªëËõãÊ≤≥Á≤â Big Prawn Hor Fun. Starts from $15. Full of prawn shells broth umami, fragrant with fried shallots and lots of Hei bee! Super üòç
If you like very strong flavours, you will most likely lick the bowl clean. It is very rich. Very old school canto style of cooking.
Set on the buzzing Keong Saik St, Kok Sen is easy to overlook as just another coffeeshop. Expect amazing Claypot Yong Tau Fu, Big Prawn Bee Hoon, and Black Pepper Beef with Bitter Gourd. This is one of those places you bring your parents to for a nice dinner, even though it\'s a humble little restaurant. Be prepared for slightly higher prices, it\'s totally worth it though! 
small serving ($14) feeds 2 Pax and comes with 4 huge prawns. prawns are fried with chilli and garlic first before adding the soup. a rainy day staple. 
Big head prawn bee hoon. I honestly don\'t think it was that good, as the soup was not flavored enough with prawn shells, and the reddish color came mainly from chili powder, not prawns.
It\'s either roast pork or beef for me, with broccoli!  My favorite!

The Egg! It can take all shapes and size and appear in any form! This dish although common does not always tastes good! At Kok Sen, they certainly nailed it down. The salt level is on point and the other ingredients like shrimps, char siew(real), spring onions/onions really help bring up the overall flavor to its full potential! It\'s really egglicious!

In my mind I should see thick gooey dark brown gravy over the kwayteow (flat noodles). But it was a pleasant surprise to see golden yellow flowy egg yolk by the side and brown gooeyness on the top and everywhere. Was it done on purpose or was it the chef had to cook this in a hurry?\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />It actually didnt matter cos after tossing and turning, the yolk will change into a nice white scrambled mess by the residual heat. Kway teow had a wokheish finish. It was smooth. It was slippery. It was slurpworthy.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />The standard, as I remembered when I had it about a year ago, was almost on point. Only slight difference is prolly a tinge salty. Doors opened at 12pm but the place was at fullhouse 10 mins on. So if you are thinking of visiting, either go very early, avoid the crowd or be prepared to wait at least half an hour or more and that is not including food waiting time.

it\'s infuse with prawns! The prawn taste is evident with every sip and certainly lives up to its name as big prawn Hor Fan. They are definitely huge and there\'s a generous amount of it too.

Many will stay away from bitter gourd but i highly encourage all to try this bitter gourd spare ribs, the bitter gourd done with black bean sauce, gone is the bitter component, whats left is fragrant, tender slices of bitter gourd. Ribs are a lil below std today thou
YTF FTW.
And this is their signature dish. I knew it would be good before I even tried it, because a table of 2 old uncles ordered exclusively that.

\"Wokhei\" is the essence or flavor that\'s imbued by the Wok into the dish when frying over high heat. It\'s the browned or charred parts that usually taste the best.\n<br />-\n<br />The mixture of spicy XO sauce with the fresh prawns give birth to this gooey mess of flavors that\'s homely and nostalgic.\n<br />-\n<br />Nothing like a good plate of charred Horfun to end the night.\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #burpple #koksen #burpplecheapngood

I remembered I met 2 strangers sharing our table and we became friends. üîπüîπ\n<br />Today I had the craving for a soupy lunch so ended here having an expensive bowl of prawn noodle soup at a coffeeshop. The soup base was spicy but yet sweet. Alas, if I compared from the last time I had it, soup lacks the prawny flavor. The \'wow\' factor for me had diminished. üîπüîπ\n<br />It was good to have on a rainy day.

Best Hor Fun in Singapore. üòç #howtonotbefat #Burpple
Big fresh prawns üëç
üòã
No doubt the big prawn hor fun was good and the cereal prawns were pretty decent. The prawn paste chicken tasted like just average fried chicken. Not quite worth the very long waiting time.\n<br />#tzechar #stirfry #horfun #big #prawns #cereal #prawn #chicken #friedchicken #ÁÖÆÁÇí #koksen #dinner #foodstagram #foodies #foodgram #foodpics #chinesefood #food #delish #sgfood #good #hungry #instalike #instafollow #instafood #instafoodsg #8dayseat #burpple #overrated #latergram

The tantalizing gravy and fresh, huge shrimps servd with flecks of fiery red chillies will definitely be able to stimulate your taste buds
.\n<br />Probably the only place to my knowledge to do YTF in this manner. Usage of claypot simply elevated the fragrance of YTF.

(Yeh, we do it a bit differently around here üòù). Suggestions anybodyÔºü
