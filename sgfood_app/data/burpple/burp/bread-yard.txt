I wasn\'t sure what to expect when I ordered it. But it sure was a helleva surprise.
what a down-to-earth establishment! menu was simple and featured a variety of eggs done poached or scrambled in various fashions, accompanied by fresh-baked bread of your choosing. the farmer\'s ($14) came with sauteed mushrooms, grilled tomato and asparagus. the norwegian ($14) came with smoked salmon and fresh greens. poached eggs and hollandaise sauce were decent, especially given the price! bread was deliciously nutty and chewy :-))
This has always been on bread yard\'s menu but it took me a long time before I finally tried it because it leans towards the pricier end at $7. But I totally like it and I\'m already looking forward to the next time when I feel slightly richer so I can get another one lol. My friend found it too sour, but I think it\'s good and definitely refreshing for the upcoming summer.
Wanting to up your breakfast game? This Candied Bacon &amp; Grilled Cheese might be a delight for you. After coming here disappointed 2x because they had run out of this pancake, we finally managed to get our hands on this (with a $3 increase from the previous 2 failed visits though). Nonetheless, this is still a lovely matrimony of sweet and savoury. The grilled cheese, hidden in the stacks of pancake, blends really well with the generous \"bak kwa\" bacon strips and then you have the runny egg that completes the package. Pancakes are rather dense but still chewy and fluffy at the same time, and they are gloriously basking in maple syrup. If you are not into sweet stuff, ask them to separate the maple syrup for you.
Brunch(8am-4pm): Farmers $14(front), Norwegian $14(back). Hokkaido toast topped with choice of scrambled, poached eggs or sunny side up. Nicely done but nothing exceptional. Toast was slightly on the tough side but the saut√©ed mushrooms and asparagus was pretty good!
[$12] A place for some comfort food that isn\'t terribly overpriced. This was really delicious, with the pancakes being the right density though I didn\'t really taste much of the grilled cheese. Candied bacon tasted a lot like bak kwa especially with the maple syrup but not complaining! If you don\'t have a sweet tooth, I suggest you cut back on the syrup if not it\'ll get overly sweet in a few mouthfuls. The fried egg sandwiched in between was a nice addition though I would prefer if the yolk was slightly runny. Do check out their brunch menu which allows you to customise your own meal!
Candied bacon with grilled cheese and egg hidden with the pancake stack. Fluffy pancakes and the combi is like MACS breakfast, level-up version.
The food was generally really nice. Bread yard serves brunch and bakes their own bread!! Bread was thick and worth the try. The top plate is the big boy\'s and it was worth as it includes alot of ingredients - egg(either scrambled, sunny side, Benedict), hot dog, bread, salad, bacon, grilled tomato. \n<br />For the bottom plate, it is a customised \n<br />meal, which is suitable for picky eaters like me! Set is available with an ice tea and mashed potato which were super yummy and recommended for all potato lovers. \n<br />All in all, it was a good meal for an affordable priceüëç
For less than $8, you get thick cuts of ham and cheese sandwiched between country bread! Super legit üòÇ
The name says it all, and sandwiched between freshly baked Hokkaido bread at only $3! I also added saut√©ed wild mushrooms for another $2.50. 
Norwegian platter from Bread Yard, with eggs on Hokkaido toast and smoked salmon. #lunch #burpple #breadyardsg
Bread yard is a hidden gem offering delicious brunch at affordable prices. My Bettino Full Platter ($10), bottom right, had nicely grilled back bacon. Mmmm that crispness. My favourite part of the entire dish would be their poached eggs with hollandaise sauce atop the honey baked ham and Hokkaido bread. The thick bread had an amazingly crusty edge and fluffy soft centre. I could even taste the faintest hint of milkiness that added on to the bread\'s overall yum-factor. The poached eggs were done to perfection too! Imagine my exuberance the moment the golden runny yolk oozed out :) Their desserts are pretty awesome too, especially their apple raisin bread pudding ($6). The hot-cold combination of the pudding and vanilla ice-cream made the dessert quite the highlight of the meal
The Hokkaido bread was a little sweet but has great texture. The honey ham was ok. But the back bacon was great! Flavorful and not too far. Eggs were ok but yolk could be more runny. Love the compostable plates and clean up after yourself style! Would be back! 4/5üåü
Thick yet amazingly fluffy pancakes (no artificial rising agents used, only wild yeast!) with a sunny side up in between, candied bacon on the top and crispy grilled cheese surrounding the bottom. Just tell me, HOW DOES THAT NOT SOUND GOOD? Plus! Not forgetting a generous amount of maple syrup drizzled all over. This guys, is a perfect example of how savory and sweet can work well together. Portion looks small but surprisingly filling. Maple syrup was quite sweet for me but requesting it to be served separately should solve the problem. This is served till 6pm but I missed it on my first visit at 3pm. Go early for a satisfying sinful breakfast with thumbs up service! 
New kid on the block whips up magically fresh meals! Balsamic vinaigrette; has a nice sweet and tangy balance for its fresh leaves. Asparagus lightly seasoned and not over cooked. Hokkaido milk toast is freshly baked in house, smoked salmon is not over salted, the eggs are immaculate! It\'s smooth and the cream used is not overwhelming. Extremely well balanced. Bonus points for using biodegradable plates! Would surely be back! They do delivery if you work in one north! #lifechanging
Came here for the Grilled Cheese Pancakes but they ran out of batter :( This bread pudding was a thumbs up though! Served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it was a very comforting dessert. Loved the crunchy bits of raisins and apples within the pudding. For $6, I\'ll come back again. 
Amazing saut√©ed mushrooms I would gladly top up for another extra serving! There\'s never too many saut√©ed mushrooms. Generous serving size for $14 with back bacon, chicken sausage and Hokkaido bread. Hot chocolate at $4 was decent too. Gonna go back again soon for the Candied Bacon and Grilled Cheese Pancakes! 
Love the wholesome and affordable options here at Bread yard! One of my favorites would have to be the cheesy pancakes with lots of candied bacon and maple syrup!! 
{Grilled Bacon and Cheese Pancakes} came with two really thick and fluffy layers, sandwiched with a fried egg in between, and the best part? THE GRILLED CHEESE. Yes that\'s the crispy thingy you see at the base.\n<br />\'Nuff said. One of the best pancakes ever!! üòçüòç
Probably my biggest mistake was to order a cold-hot food when I was extremely hungry. I couldn\'t really taste the smokiness from the salmon. Maybe it would be better if they could heat their dishes well before serving it. I found my roasted potato to be just warm and so were my bf\'s soup and sandwiches (rib-eye steak) which confused our tummies after eating. On a side note, their wasabi mayo tasted pretty good and they were generous with ingredients!
Remembered how good their Apple &amp; Raisin Bread Pudding was, so we were back to give the Banana &amp; Coconut variant a try! This was more dense and felt more like Banana Bread in texture, but I liked how they had sliced caramalised bananas within for flavour. Since Gula Melaka is stickier and more thick in consistency, it does not get absorbed as much into the bread pudding unlike Creme Anglaise which was used for the Apple &amp; Raisin. This would overall appeal to those who love local-flavoured desserts; there\'s no denying how local coconut and Gula Melaka is, and also don\'t forget the comforting Vanilla ice-cream as well which might be commercial-tasting, but hard to complain at $6 as a whole package.
Rating: 4/5. Price: $13 nett. Pretty reasonably priced for the quality of the food. Poached eggs were pretty well done. üëçüèΩ Nice ambience for catching up over a meal. Not a 5/5 because the coffee was a tad too strong for my liking. 
A glorious meld of fluffy McGriddles, grilled cheese, sunny side up, maple syrup &amp; caramelized bacon can convert even the most ardent non-believer of sweet-savoury mashups. Easy on the eye, tongue &amp; wallet; available only till 6pm.
Scrambled Eggs on Toast ($4.50) + Chicken Sausage ($4) + Saut√©ed Mushroom ($2.50) + Saut√©ed Baby Spinach ($2.50) = $13.50 worth of well balanced breakfast of Fibre, proteins and carbohydrates ‚úåÔ∏è
- warm and fluffy even after a long shoot topped with comforting plain vanilla ice cream and that pour of creme anglaise to perfect it. So remedying in today\'s chilly hazy weather.
Coming in three different variations, we figured getting this would be better for it was a different flavour from the already sweet pancake stack I had. Turned out to be a wise decision; the bread and butter pudding was warm, and when turns soft as it absorbs the Creme Anglaise which carried a light vanilla and custard-like flavour. Can\'t complain much about the quality of the Vanilla Ice-Cream for this comes at just $6, but the texture though not too disturbing could have been less icy at certain parts. Nonetheless, a very satisfying end to the meal which was not too hard on the wallet. Just a side note; we kinda rearranged this as it originally comes with the Bread &amp; Butter Pudding beside the Vanilla Ice-Cream, and the Creme Anglaise in a small plastic container to pour in.
I can\'t believe it if anyone actually looks at this dish and can\'t be appetised; who can resist all that bacon that\'s dripping maple syrup all over and that grilled cheese that is lined at the bottom? Found this a really classier and more premium version of McGriddles; the maple syrup comes as a pool on the plate so the top layers do not get soaked and get overly sweet, balancing the bottom that had absorbed the maple syrup. The grilled cheese comes in between; some parts melted and stringy while some more dried out, both good in their own right and provides flavour and textural differences for one is crispier and more savoury, and in between also comes a fried egg which helps to balance the heavy taste. On the top, there are two pieces of crisp bacon was candied and caramalised, sweetly coated with syrup. A heavily sinful breakfast it is, but one that is sure to take your troubles away as well!
To be very honest, I didn\'t expect it to be so good since y\'know it\'s just brunch food, and brunch food is everywhere these days. I really enjoyed the poached eggs with that super awesome zesty Hollandaise and their coffee (only $3.50 for drip coffee!). Both of us gobbled down our mains and went \"wow, this is really good! Shall we order more? Hehe\". Will definitely be back! 
Topped with candied bacon, the serving was notably small but really filling as sandwiched between the 2 thick pancakes were grilled cheese and a sunny-side up.
Eggs (scrambled, poached or fried) on Hokkaido bread and smoked salmon with many greens! All for $13 nett. Bread Yard deserves more recognition!! 
Drip coffee from Bread Yard\n<br />Acidic, yet smooth \n<br />Strong \"roasted\" aftertaste \n<br />Blend is from El Salvador, supposedly has a fruity and sweet aftertaste which I couldn\'t pick out :/
Visited Bread Yard at its new location at the Galaxis building which is still under construction. Get there by walking out Fusionopolis via Ya Kun or via Exit B of one-north station. 
The Short Review
Despite its unassuming looks, this was one satisfying if not filling sandwich for lunch. While it probably would not leave you full, the tender braised pork belly was in harmony with the preserved vegetables such as the cucumbers and carrots to provide a slight sour-ish crunch, all in between two slices of their in-house Hokkaido Milk Toast which is light and crisp yet fluffy. The only gripe was the sheer amount of bones in the pork belly, which seemed a tad unacceptable given its a sandwich.
Sadly their coffee just doesn\'t reach the mark, despite using Chemex hand brew. Bland and flat in the flavour profile it was hard to even get through half the cup.
Saw my favourite bread&amp; butter pudding so I had to order! Pretty decent at $6, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Gula Melaka sauce. Choice of banana coconut, chocolate mint or Apple raisin 
$10 (no Gst service charge here!) , pretty substantial no frills sandwich. The bread was a bit too hard for my liking though
Absolutely loving the breads here!!! [FOODIE NEWS] : @Breadyard has officially reopened after its relocation from SUTD to Fusionpolis place. To promote its revamped menu, there will be 25% off everything in the first week from 9-14 March! Good news since it\'s only Tuesday. *Meow*
Haven\'t gone back to SUTD for a long while and I missed the food here, so I ordered an eggs bettino set + a ham &amp; cheese sandwich, a meal fit for 2!
All these for less than $15 (the book belong to Tokyo)! Rather to say this is a cafe, it feel more like a bakery. Very nice school like feel. Thanks to Tokyo for letting me \"steal\" his book to use as prop! Lol\n<br />#burpple #sutd #breadyard #doverdrive #schoolcafe
this is nothing to shout about, but where else can you find eggs benedict priced at $6.90?
Sausage with scrambled eggs. Bacon with scrambled eggs. Roast need sandwich. Together with roasted and mashed potatoes and refreshed house iced tea. Yummy good affordable food in the middle of SUTD. Students here have a special discounted price. 
and some fresh salad and ice tea along with it
the most affordable eggs benedict around - eggs bettino
Had this when they were still located at SUTD\'s temporary campus.
I could eat her everyday, but sadly it only opens during weekdays. So good to have handcrafted bread. 
where can you get a ham &amp; cheese sandwich student menu at $4.90.
Bacon pancakes bacon bacon bacon pancakes ~ layers of candied bacon, pancakes, eggs and cheese. Looks good but not my cup of tea =/ but I love the bacon, tastes like bak kwa. Also, their pancakes are \n<br />fermented with natural yeast. This dish is like a French toast but made with pancakes instead of toasts. Their cinnamon bun is awesome too.
This well loved, long missing dish is back!!! *Big slurpssss* üëÖ
I like cold and raw food but not for scrambled eggs and chicken?! the only good was the seasoning used.
Moist pulled pork with perfectly poached eggs!

Three words that are never said enough: \"Bak Kwa Pancakes\" ($12) - Two fluffy pancakes sandwiching a fried egg, and generously topped with sweet, spicy bacon. We also ordered  the divine Banana Coconut Bread Pudding ($6) with gula melaka caramel and Key Lime Tart ($7). To wash it down, we had a Spiced Mocha ($5.50) as I thought it was going to be made of typical spices like cinnamon. It was only a second later that a sudden burn at the back of my throat made it obvious that chilli was actually used! Despite the spiciness, this drink was oddly refreshing at the same time. .\n<br />Read the full review at http://eatbook.sg/bread-yard/\n<br />.\n<br />Bread Yard\n<br />Address: 1 Fusionopolis Place, #01-23/24, Galaxis, Singapore 138632\n<br />Operating Hours: Monday - Friday 8am to 7:30pm, Saturday 9am to 2:30pm\n<br />.\n<br />Writer / Video talent: @heytheredreamer\n<br />Videographer: @tippytoess\n<br />Photographer: @cookiesnqream

Tastes funny
The bread just never disappoints ($10)
With a hidden egg inside! Pancakes had a unique texture
Insert some chim word and it sure piqued my interest. Evidently, taking their craft very seriously since they bake their breads in house. Wished they had used proper crockery instead of disposables though. #breadyard #cafehoppingsg #sgcafes #burpple #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #foodpornsg #eatoutsg #supportlocal
Simple but yet filling breakfast sets at $10 with an additional $2 for the soup of the day. Kudos to the wonderful combination of honey mustard drizzled over the jumbo sausage.
