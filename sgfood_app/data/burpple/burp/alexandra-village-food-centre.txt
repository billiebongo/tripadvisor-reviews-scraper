Price: $5.00 (10 pcs)\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />üöá: Queenstown\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Shanghai Xiao Long Bao have been planting itself into the Singapore food scene. You can find them in restaurants (DTF) or at hawker center. There is one particular store that me and XBC frequently visit.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />They are popular for their XLB, It has a good meat to skin ratio and the skin is not too thin until it will break if you lift it up. The broth was towards the sweet side, however, it was too sweet for our liking. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />What we both love about this store is their steam dumpling. The meat to skin ratio was just nice. The skin is a little thicker than their XLB, but their meat tastes flavourful and tender. It has become a norm for us to order if we are there. \n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Overall, all their dumplings and XLB are handmade. You can even order a whole packet, from them if you have a party. Perhaps next time I will give their XLB a try again. 
all i can sayy is this briyani is pretty decent, thats where it stops.. i called for the thigh but instead theyy gave me the breast meat.. the breast meat is not to myy likingg as its too dryy and i prefer moist, juicyy chicken.. portion of rice is tad too big but at least it has flavour in it.. in summaryy, i think there are far better briyani options out there..
What a great surprise to find this on the way to IKEA. Full of energy from this non-ending \"Mala\" punchy taste on the tongue! 10 dumplings for 5$
A twist of it\'s own in house marination in their main dishes &amp; who would have thought sweet potato fries would taste so gooooooood! With mayo, chilli nacho cheese &amp; cut chilli padi. üëçüëçüëçüòã  
I decided to come back to try Mr Avocado but sad to say it was closed no choice gotta try other stall instead. Frankly Speaking Every Fruit Juice Stall at Alexandra Village  Hawker Center Selling Avocado Juice at $2.50 Looking like the stall owner are snatching each other business like snatching their customer away. Nvm I will still be back for Mr Avocado. This  is my 2nd Avocado Drink. Operating Hours for this fruit juice stall I am nt sure cos I didn\"t ask.\n<br />Name:Alexandra Village Avocado\n<br />Address:Blk 120 Bukit Merah Lane 1 #01-11 Singapore 150120
Look like All the Fruit Juice Stall selling Avocado Milkshake at $2.50. Seriously are they snatching each other business like snatching their customer away asking the customers to patronised the stall. Different Fruit Juice Stall owner has different tactic of doing business. Since I dislike the milk version I order the Avocado added with honey. Alright When I am there next time I will try it &amp; compare.\n<br />My 1st Avocodo Drink is at King Avocado.\n<br />Name:King Avocado È≥ÑÊ¢®Ê∞¥ÊûúÁéã\n<br />Address:Blk 120 Bukit Merah Lane 1 #01-17 Alexandra Village Food Centre  Singapore 150120\n<br />Operating Hours:0800-2200\n<br />Closed on Every Wednesday
This bowl of dried prawn noodles looks so mouth -watering, i would prefer more chilli as i am a chilli lover. Their in house made chilli paste is special and the chilli powder is also made from shrimps. The soup is well flavoured and is filled with freshness of prawns. Its quite a nice prawn noodle that i would mind eating again:)üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
very crispy n kinda juicy.. still, remind me of pasamalam chic wing.. their chilli got the right kick tho. 4 wings $8 #sgfood #burpple
demage $41.. the clams are fresh, fat and yummy. But their mains can be improved.. mac cheese ($10) for plain one not worth it. Fish &amp; chip ($11) #sgfood #burpple
Amazing herbal broth with succulent meat. Mee Sua that doesn\'t become soggy and pig innards cooked to the right doneness üòÑüòÑ
By Jove, that chap! (the bowl of black sauce which defines the phrase \"it tastes better than it looks\").\n<br />I\'m craving this quite badly. Also, because there\'s no feeling of nausea from looking at food pictures, this is certainly a sign that I\'ve recovered from food poisoning ‚úåüèº
But I still want more!!! http://www.jayellyn.blogspot.sg  #burpple #hawkerfood #sghawker
Good old hot, hearty, sumptuous pot of steaming rice, choke full of sausages and chicken pieces, added with the amount of dark soy sauce and chill that we like.
All I wish is for a table like this ‚òù and tuck straight in! üòã
I really thank the people around me who has been giving me suggestions or guiding me to take better pictures on Instagram and I hope to do even better as the 3rd millennium starts. Since this is a continuing process,
There\'s so many dialects calling the sambal fish differently. My friend corrected me as hanghe. I don\'t really know which is correct one. Hahhaa! Anyway, the stingray that I ordered is meaty can cost me $15. The sambal is just nice, not so spicy and not too oily. Overall not bad lah. 
Creamy succulent pork ribs done with curry leaves. Sinfully good.!! Tried this dish at many other places, this is still the best. (Star Yong Kwang BBQ Seafood @ #01-04 )
Who does not like BBQ\'d meat on a stick? \n<br />I will never get sick of eating this! It\'s a must to order this whenever I\'m here for dinner no matter how full I\'m amüòÅ  #burpple #hawkerfood #sghawker
This was pretty good! Almost late for the second half of the 1st day of TPP last week becus of this plate of yum!
Jin pai zi char curry fish head $17-$20 top 10 in hawker center sgp 
One of the better carrot cake is at this Alexandra market. This store open by two uncles. Usually I like the carrot cake to be more spicy and fry longer in order to achieve the slight burnt taste. 
Queued for a short while on a Sunday afternoon. But it was all worth it. The sauce is very fragrant and the braised egg was more than a brown coloured egg. The duck was deboned and sliced thinly for you to enjoy. Everyone in front of me was ordering takeaways by the whole duck. This is definitely worth coming back to.
Colleagues have been obsessing over this store for months! I find it ok. Nothing I\'d crave for, more like a self torture \"let me see how much spice I can eat without choking or crying\" type of challenge. I find it a little on the expensive side, especially for lunch in a hawker centre, surrounded by so much other good food. Have never managed to pay less than $6 and only reduced the price by not picking fish/meats (nothing fancy) that usually tip the price to the $10+ side‚Ä¶ for a bowl of super spicy, oily and msg smothered veges. I must stop eating this.
Sometimes, boring food can be the most comforting food.
You order dishes for this like cai bng, and they all get doused in a customary bath of curry gravy. Pure sin.
One of the best I\'ve had since I stepped into Singapore. Crunchy textures (of the cake &amp; egg) and oysters big enough for my liking. Yums! 
Besttt laksa in sg. I like that its thick yet not gelat. And gravy is really smooth without all the hei bi. And there\'s no hum inside also. Only tau pok slices, shreds of chicken and fish cake. But sooo satisfying!
Tasty noodles, big portion at a cheap price of 3 dollars! 
A no holds barred lunch. Love the curry, the kind where it is intense, rich and filled with coconut milk. All this for $5.
Love the cool way the boss chops, slice and scoops the duck meat. Classy cool craft.
Really good, though the soup is a little too thick for my liking. :) Will eat again!
Skin was thin and soft, filling quite a lot and fresh. Most important is they served powerful chilies. Must pre order.
Yummy! But too filling... Food coma inducing portion for just $3...
Overall taste is quite nice. My colleagues call this \"fake char siew\", so if you don\'t like the non roasted type of BBQ pork this probably isn\'t for you. The portion is really too big for me and it\'s just $2.50. Seems that everyone\'s favourite part are the noodles!
Soya chicken noodles add extra dumplings for lunch!
Hawker fare for lunch!

Only when I have an excuse to.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Beef horfun without that dark gooey sauce. Horfun had a subtle taste of wokhei (smokyness), already pre-cooked.  Beef was also prepared in advance. All the uncle had to do was to prepare the sauce and splashed it over. Kinda miss seeing the fire engulfing the kway teow and the wok. I suppose the advance cookout was to cater to the peak hour madness.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />It was tasty. Beef seasoned well and was tender.

At only $4.50 for 7 little juicy and savoury buns of goodness, what is there not to like!!! The buns were still got even when I ate it half and hour later. One quip I have about this is that there could have been more minced meat and chives added to the filling for a more shiok taste.

This is my breakfast. I happen to be at Alexandra food centre and this chicken noodle stall serves the best soy chicken and dumplings. What a day to start eating recklessly.
