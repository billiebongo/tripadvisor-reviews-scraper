Succulent slabs of pork grilled to perfection, paired with creamy pumpkin and some peppers for a little flavour and texture variation. Just look at the juicy glaze on the pork!!! My belly will go to sleep happy tonight!
Squid Ink Spanish noodles cooked paella style with crispy calamari and dollops of aioli throughout to add some creamy texture. Love the slightly charred noodles at the bottom of the pan. Spanish flavours at UNA‚ÄìOne Rochester.\n<br />#UNAoneRochester

Each dish is 500 calories or less and/or is made up of at least 8% wholegrains.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />I like this year\'s theme as it proves healthy eating does not equate to boring, tasteless food. Healthy food still can taste good and visually appealing.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Like the Foie Gras and Grilled Figs on Crispy Spanish Flatbread with Vermouth Reduction ($26) created by @1_una at One Rochester. Rich, buttery perfectly seared foie gras. The sweet grilled figs (with a hint of smokiness) cut through the richness of the foie gras. Wouldn\'t have thought this dish is only 384.1 calories!

but where\'s my dash of paprika like i had you previously? i still love the bite and texture on you but taste surely wasn\'t as intense as before and why did you come out just barely warm? p.s when you serve me my latte while i was dining and i asked for it to serve later, you serve me a fresh cup when i asked for it again, NOT just keeping it warm by the side! i can tell because is bloody obvious.
Very healthy cos cinnamon sugar was sprinkled sparingly. A beautiful quiet place to laze the afternoon away. Recommended to bring ur date for a romantic look into each other eyes time.
Sunday Brunch will be back in Nov during Festive period but how they work their Parrilla esp the Prawns, juicy, fresh, tasty &amp; nicely grilled!!
I literally died at this dessert, Chef Philippe probably does the nicest churros ever. \n<br />Moist and crispy coated with decent amount of sugar dipped in dark chocolate sauce, satisfying dessert to end my Friday night.
UNA‚Äôs pop-up World Beer Series Bar on its entrance patio is a hot stop to cool off and quench that thirst on a wide selection of ice cold beers and ciders from around the world, all cooled in minus 6-degrees ice and at an unbeatable price. 
Indulge in UNA\'s Spanish Boqueria and Tapas; as well as seafood, various grills and 5 kinds of different eggy from the eggs station. üç≥ |\n<br />The pluma iberica from the grilled section is our favorite pick. At UNA, you will be able to savor the best flavours of Spain. üá™üá∏ Thank you @una.1 for having us.
was so full by the time the paella arrived to our table but widely acclaimed as spain‚Äôs national dish, nobody should leave una without trying its signature paella. rice was throughly bathed well with seafood goodness and teeming with freshest seafood catch. while one may worry bout overcooked ingredients, the perfectly cooked shells was clearly a testament to chef jp\'s culinary finesse. am no leading authority when it comes to judging food but you cant be that wrong at a place helmed by a previous head chef at Quo Vadis - identified as one of the best restaurants in London by Gordon Ramsay.
lo and behold, the beluga caviar of hams, the prized jamon (pronounced \"hamon\") iberico bellota at una. fed with rich sweet acorns, these paper thin cured hams come dark red meat interlaced with white veins of fat that are sweet, nutty and never too heavy or salty for your palate. this is ham redefine altogether for me in one night.
throwback to last week when i was at @una.1 for some fantastic tapas and grills. and here is chef JP\'s divine grilled octupus: chewy carefully burnt exterior lends a lovely smoky flavor with a light paprika taste to excite, yet the interior was freshness soft and sweetness of the octupus still shine thoughout the bite.
weekend already started yesterday night at a spanish europe restaurant/bar Una in a charming enclave of one rochester. thanks to lush995fm, Chope app and dj rosalyn lee of lush fm, the inaugural event of RozzEatsXChope comienza when we were treated to a spread of some of the best spanish cold cuts. marbled fat makes ham glistening spanishingly beautiful. delish!
steak tartare topped with quail egg yolk at una. perfecto capsule portion of chopped season raw steak smoothened by the runny yolk was enjoyable but was given a much needed texture with the green and baguette wafers by the side. but the showstopper was definitely the choice of green as chef jp decided to impart another taste on top of the tartare with the distinct flavor of oceanlike brine with an oyster leaf. texture notwithstanding, you bet your last dollar that you were slurping a pristine oyster.
Hidden in this quiet enclave near Dover is one probably one of the best plates of paella I\'ve eaten in Singapore. The seafood was fresh and generous, rice was bursting with flavour from the sea and it was served warm on a cold day. While this establishment is still pretty new on the scene, it\'s fast gaining a reputation for dishing up quality food that warms up the soul! 
Pricey at $20 each, but distinctively more robust and flavourful than everyday prawns.
This was the only highlight at Una, where I found a baby roach on my table, had to wait more than 30 minutes for my food, and had a disappointing Poulet with no crisped edges as promised on the menu.
Post on the blog, link in bio.
Was so stuffed but I finished whatever was dished to me and more. Heh. As usual, great company once again.
üñ§ Wished the calamari was a little crispier though. üòã [Media Tasting]
About last night\'s Spanish fiesta with @xitharcane- enjoying this yummy Paella de Marisco! üë´‚ù§Ô∏èThe paella was very flavourful and came with generous servings of fresh prawns, clams, mussels, saffron and chicken. Loved the moist texture of the bomba rice too, which soaked up the flavours of the seafood very nicely. \n<br />This also reminded us of the disastrous time when we took over 2 hours to cook our own paella. This is best left to the experts!

However, the landscape is about to change as people are starting to familiarize themselves with Spanish cuisine and the opening of several authentic Spanish restaurants in Singapore.\n<br />.\n<br />During the media tasting at UNA, we were presented with the Pulpo A La Parrilla Con Papas Arrugadas Y Mojo ($32), a dish of smoky grilled octopus with a medley of roasted baby potatoes, coriander and paprika sauce. Everything works expect that the chef might have gone a tad heavy on the salt. Perhaps less is more?\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @1_una for hosting and @affluencepr for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />UNA\n<br />Address: 1, Rochester Park, Singapore 139212 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #una #unaonerochester #spanishfood #octopus

you don\'t get overwhelmed by the flavours of the duck liver as the combination of fig and drizzle of sweet honey compliments well.
Foie gras is on point and sweet refreshing grilled fig enhanced the overall taste. Atop a slice of Spanish flatbread that is soft and crispy, this pretty dish only gives you 384.1 calories! Yes!

Available at @1_UNA\n<br />Super crispy skin, although would prefer to have it deboned as it is quite boney.\n<br />The place is packed with the upper floor closed for a company event.

Ok, that\'s all.
smokiness of the cod really elevates the taste and sends me back to San Sebasti√°n. Rest of the dishes were so so only sadly. #burpple #sgeats #whati8today
The texture of the meat is grilled till so soft that it bears resemblance of a steak.
