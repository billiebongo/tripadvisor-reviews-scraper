Firstly, it\'s size (about A3 size? And about an inch thick - filled with lots of ingredients)
With mayonnaise, luncheon meat, cheese and floss. Think I might prefer the traditional fare, but found this worth trying! 
Think eggs benedict prata. They seem to have used a normal hollandaise sauce instead of the curry spiced hollandaise I had last time... felt that was better.
When this arrived at the table I was trying so hard not to be an excited little kid because I have seen so many photos and been wanting to try this for the past one year already. Truth to be told, as gimmicky as it may seem this worked very well to my tastebuds; I thoroughly enjoyed the different elements of the dish together. The catch of all has to be the Hollandaise-Curry combination; never had I imagined that the marriage would result in a sweet, yet tangy curry flavour that is almost like putting canned pineapples into the curry without losing the richness of the spices. A must-try once before you die, and for me though it would not be a must-order for future visits, I guess I would be tempted to have it at least once in a while.
Much more enjoyable than I\'d expected, though a little too salty for my taste. Would recommend trying at least once.
Tandoori chicken, cheese and onions... This is what I am here for!!
People tell me that Zam Zam sells the best murtabak in Singapore, but I honestly prefer the one here. Tandoori chicken, onions and portobello mushroom together with melted mozzarella cheese, enclosed in a light flaky crispy Prata skin. Top it off with their extremely flavourful curry which complemented the cheese very well and you\'ve got a calorie ladened but way too-worth-it lunch in your tummy. 
Definitely the heartiest meal I\'ve had in a while. The combination of sweet and savory prata (with the red bean Prata being the former and the ultimate murtabak being the latter) satisfied every sort of craving we had. Totally no regrets dragging my lazy ass all the way to Upper Thomson area for this!
A wave of nostalgia at the original springleaf prata place. I always ate their mushroom cheese prata last time when I was doing research at the zoo. Now I\'m here 4 years later and eating an upgraded version of it. üòÇ couldn\'t take a nice photo to show the stringiness of the mozzarella but was too hungry to contribute trying haha.
Amazing combination of east and west. Why didn\'t anyone do it earlier! 
I can help thinking of this Blaster Plaster from springleaf Prata place
How about having prata with poached egg and Indian hollandaise sauce for breakfast? Aromatic buttery prata is made ala minute and topped with turkey ham, very runny egg yolk and drizzled with Indian spiced hollandaise sauce. This dish by The Prata Place is making its debut at #UltimateHawkerFest2014. It made all of us squeal with excitement. We tried it and we love it! Purchase your tickets online www.ultimatehawkerfest.sg to avoid the long ticketing queue and you can collect the tickets on the actual day at Suntec.

Sunday goodness! 
Plaster egg and cheese, cheesy and QQ on the inside yet crispy on the outside. Oomph! I dare say this is the best prata I\'ve tasted so far! 
Crispy outside, chewy inside, eat with thick mutton of fish curry gravy. This is what I call the #best #sg local #breakfast.
Thosai cravings satisfied! Ordered the cheese thosai which reminds me very much of my primary school days~ oh, nostalgia. 
The Ultimate Mutabak is really awesome. Best I\'ve ever eaten.
Went home happy and slept like a baby. üë∂üò¥\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #food #foodie #foodpics #halalsg #halal #halalfood #halalsingapore #singaporefood #sgfood #sgfoodie #hungry #hungrygirl #cravings #rotiprata #eggprata #pratatelur #fishcurry #tehtarik #springleafprataplace #bestsupperever

üòÇ Finally gotten onto the MurtaBurger bandwagon. #üê¢ Selamat Hari Raya Haji to all my Muslim friends. üòò Thank you for the much needed loOooOoooOooog weekend!
Honestly, it\'s pretty good and I enjoyed every bit of it! Though I still did order another normal prata cause I wanted to dip some curry. üòÅüòÅüòÅ Time to try it if you haven\'t! #$5prata #springleaf #poachedeggswithprata #burpple #pepperminterfoodadventure #plasterblaster
I would honestly say, this place served quite decent Prata. It is slightly crispy on the outside and it is quite soft and fluffy on the inside. I love the murtaburger where you can taste both sweet and savoury due to the chicken floss hidden inside the cheese. The plaster blaster, it\'s the heaven of all mayo lovers, you can totally see it in the picture. Please don\'t expect good quality service here, the staffs here only believe in fast and efficient. In Conclusion, this is nice and had a lot of variety but I still prefer sin ming roti prata üòÅ\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br /> Ps it will soon be easily accessible, when the mrt line is done. ‚Ä¢\n<br />#eltonventure #igfood #igsg #igfood #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #vscocam #vscofood #fooddairy #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodpic #exploresingapore #rotiprata #murtabak #likethatalsocaneggporn

Crispy roti prata + chicken üêî drummy curry üòô . üì∑ is the double üç≥ + onion, would have been fantastic if the onions were saut√©ed first .
#jinhojiak #foodporn #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple #20150927
Delicious and unique though! #jinhojiak #foodporn #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple #20150927
Really quite reminiscent of the Ramly burger. Good to try at least once!
With chicken luncheon meat, chicken floss, egg, mozzarella cheese, and mayonnaise, this is definitely umami!
Why not ;)\n<br />#Prata #sgfood #foodporn #theprataplace #burpple
It is actually Prata crispy dough with red bean paste and at only $3, it beats most Chinese restaurants version :)\n<br />#redbeanpaste #prata #crispy #dough #theprataplace #sgfood #foodporn #burpple

Waited about 30 mins for this, but the #large #portions made up for it. Surprisingly #NotOily with lots of #ChoppedNuts and #vegetables, but I\'m not a fan of #Singapore #mee #goreng.  #burpple #prataplace #sgfood
This is the best way to kickstart the day.  #breakfast #curry #Milo #yummy #Singapore #igsg #foodporn #fooddiary #sgfood #foodie #foodgasm #sgig #instasg #foodpics
