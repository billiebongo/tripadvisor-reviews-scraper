Although some told me that this wasn\'t as nice as they expected, I enjoyed it a lot. The ramen was not too crispy and  maintained enough chewiness. The chicken was well-fried as well and very succulent. 
Disappointing! Ramen patty is too flimsy, egg mayonnaise and potato in the burger is unnecessary and does not go very well with chicken karaage. ($9.90)
Innovative concept but failed in taste and presentation. Tasted like pasta and the noodles didn\'t stick together.
Noodle \"buns\" were looser and softer this time - kinda reminded me of modanyaki, but with fried chicken, fresh onion, and egg mayo. 
Succulent homemade beef patty smeared with sweet-smokey BBQ sauce, bacon and lettuce sandwiched between chewy \"buns\" of salted ramen noodles. 
Ramen noodles bathed in a pork, chicken and shio broth for flavour before being moulded into \"buns\" and fried on the griddle. Squished between the chewy ramen patties is a crispy fillet of deep-fried chicken and peppery egg mayo - so much texture in every mouthful. Om nom nom. 
Aloha baby~ this mean burger packs am extra juicy punch with grilled pineapple. That crispy, smoky bacon is just the icing on the cake. 
Little Hiro grinds their own beef patties so the meat is chunky, not minced - I had a little trouble with the patty not holding well. I know how oxymoronic it sounds, but the blue cheese sauce was so delicate and subtle despite its trademark pungency - its creaminess was just perfect in tying the burger components together. 
Food at Little Hiro is very affordable. Here\'s a photo of smokin BBQ best brisket. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/little-hiro-bukit-timah/
Little Hiro is so new - it was previously known as Burger Shack - that I can\'t geotag it. But now you know where to go for a smashing burger that\'s out of the norm - this one has imported Japanese noodles cooked in a broth of pork, chicken and shio before being shaped with the help of egg yolk. Smooshed between the chewy \"buns\" are impeccably crispy, breadcrumbed chicken and a generous emollient of homemade egg mayo. It\'s darn filling, so please share. 
The latest food fad. Ramen claimed to be air-flown from Japan was a wee bit alkaline in taste. Chicken patty was crispy but seemed to be a bit too full of batter. Egg mayo in between for a refreshing taste. Garlic fries were crispy.
Flaky salmon that had a nice salted crispy skin with fragrant garlic butter rice. Teriyaki sauce was a wee bit too thick and salty.
Cajun spiced chicken which was tender. Served with garlic fries. Very similar to what was being served at Burger Shack previously.
Beef Hamburg Steak was not gamey and well smothered in black pepper sauce. Garlic fries were crispy and Garlic-Butter Rice were very fragrant.
You can find them at this new Hawaiian-Japanese BBQ &amp; Grill Little Hiro, which took over Burger Shack. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2014/03/27/littlehiro
Novel ramen burger that tasted like overcooked instant noodles. The ramen \'buns\' were rubbery and didn\'t go well with the chicken/beef patty. The beef ramen burger is soaked in a teriyaki like sauce. Both burgers felt rushed and uninspired but I would choose the chicken karaage. The cheese fries though slightly pricey at nearly $8 is served with a dollop of nacho cheese, and a heap of minced beef. Best to be shared among 2-3 people! Definitely recommend the cheese fries!
A little upset over the drop in standard for their burgers. At least the new decor makes it much brighter now! The fries are great as usual.

Fries were randomly delicious though. They didn\'t stain with grease and had this very comfortable coating of chill flake flour - plus the place has free flow mayo!!!! #marshmunch #burpple
Lol!  One of my bestie even commented: \"you simply can\'t resist all day breakfast right? Lol!\". Although the eggs are too overly done to my preference but the other ingredients made up for this. The #avocado are ripe but not to the point of mushy, the #bacon aren\'t too salty, the #hashbrown is not oily and the buns are well toasted without being too dry.  I can have this all day long! Lol!
Its a huge basket of #nachos topped with #cheese , #sourcream , #choppedspringoniins &amp; #groundedbeef ! Taste wise, Nothing really outstanding tho. We 3 girls tried to finished after our burgers but sadly failed. Simply too much. Lol!
The #ramenchickenkaraage #burger ! Actually the #ramennoodles  tasted &amp;feel more like spaghetti than ramen...LOL but is still a very refreshing &amp; interesting deviation from the usual buns burger. In fact, I lIke it quite a lot even tho the #chickenkaraage is quite ordinary. Gotta try the beef version next time.
Jap-Hawaiian styled burger + grill joint at the very quiet King Arcade. Order at the counter &amp; collect when your no. Is being called.
the ramen a tad salty. a little messy to eat. overall is not bad lah.
This is gonna be a cheeky evening.
