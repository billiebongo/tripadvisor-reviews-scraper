An old favorite Korean food of mine at Concorde Hotel, just perfect to kill the hunger pangs without hurting your pockets in the Orchard area! All these for just under $25  ‚Äî kimchi soup (with glass noodles instead of rice), steamed Saba fish, ramyun and deep fried dumplings. I would recommend having the kimchi soup without the glass noodles though, as they have generously added too much of it and it diluted the soup a little. The Saba fish here are the best ‚Äî I don\'t usually choose to have fish for Korean, but the Saba here are seriously huge and fat! Deep fried dumplings are smaller in size with some minced meat and glass noodles. It has the crunchy dumpling skin edges that makes it really addictive! 
At only $8.50 this set is super value!! I mean you can\'t really go wrong with this, but portion is generous üòÅüòÅ
My to go for cravings for Korean food, although they increased their price not long ago, I still patronise them for the reasonably priced and good Korean food. I tried the $9.9++ set lunch at JuShinJung, and I got to say, KimDaeMun does it better. Their kimchi soup is DAEBAK üòÇüòò
Good and affordable\n<br />Price for both Beef noodle set and Saba set: less than $20\n<br />Their kimchi are freshly served and well marinated! Though the location was rather tough to find cause most of the shops nearby the Concorde hotel are either closer down or under renovation.
Location was rather tough to find. But unexpectedly, the crowd was still able to make its way in on a Saturday afternoon. Was recommended by friends who work nearby... The ramen was rather spicy for a person who dont take much spicy food.
Red bean rice from here is really good with anything. They have steamed saba, maybe will try that for nextüòã
Try it for first time after reading many good reviews.. Serving portion is more than adequate.. Price is very affordable.. Definitely worth a visit.. Daebak!!
I keep coming back here again and again for affordable and tasty Korean food! The kimchi stew here is chock full of ingredients and makes for a very satisfying meal. 
Uh oh! The trip to Wang Dae Bak yesterday got me started on my Korean food craving. So I headed back to Kim Dae Mun, located on the 2nd floor of Concorde hotel now, for a cheap and good Korean meal. Featuring one of my favorites from the store, Kimchi Stew with Pork! At a mere $7.50, expect an collision of savoury, spicy and sour in every mouthful. This is about the most flavour-packed kimchi soup I\'ve had at this price point. Not forgetting to mention the never ending amount of tofu, pork slices and kimchi. Its authentic flavours and generous portions are amongst the many reasons why this place sees a regular flow of Korean patrons. 
$8. A very harmonious dish, everything tasted pretty good together and beef was well marinated! 
$7.50, quite well worth the price just look at the amount of ingredients in it. Ingredients were fresh, and the soup was so flavourful without being overly salty like the ones I had in Korea. Pretty sure it\'s adapted for local but I\'m not complaining. Relatively cheaper eats in town.
Home style cooking, ran by a Korean family for many years. The setting of  simple, foodcourt style did not deter the ardent fans from coming. From all walks of life, this joint only serve what they do best and nothing more. Please do not expect fancy food, but expect wholesome cooking done right, and done quick. Just as I am done paying for my food. The lady came out with my dish. Cooked just right, with enough spices the soup is delicious with exploding flavours, flooded with kimchi cabbage and pork slices, the bowl is way too big for me to finish clean, which is such a pity! $7.50/set! || PS: always trust the locals, in this case: the Koreans. 
Authentic korean soup which is hot and spicy and tasty,its well worth for $8 for the huge serving,its well hidden under a hotel but it has many patrons so guess they are all attracted to the delicious food
Huge serving of chicken which is well worth $8 however its too sweet for my liking, but overall it serve authetic korean dishes and service is fastüëçüëç
Thick, sour and spicy; super shiok! With all these spicy food, this place needs stronger aircon üòÇ
CHEAP AND GOOD is all I have to say! Will be nice if they gave both anchovies and kimchi for side dishes; you can only choose one. But I\'m not complaining since the portion is generous! 
Haven\'t been here since they relocated, really simple yet satisfying stone grill sliced beef set ($9) and fried mandu ($4).Slightly pricier than last time. But still very good.
|\n<br />Their grilled spicy chicken was always so good! üòäüòäüòä
Went there a couple of times before, decided to try out their kimchi soup ($7) this time. The portion was so generous, I probably ate my lifetime\'s worth of kimchi then (other ingredients were: beancurd, korean tang hoonüòÇ, pork). I guess because of the amount of kimchi that was in the soup, the soup was very sour. Will update in the near future other dishes that im gonna try there! I would recommend their bibimbap &amp; stir fry pork/chicken $8/7.50 (their serving of meat is generous as well can order for 2 to share) 
Food on plate:\n<br />kimchi soup set $7  - yummyy &amp; it comes in a big portion that can be shared among two girls! Comfort food for the rainy season recently\n<br />Dumpling soup non spicy $6 - taste is just right,  the dumpling is so juicy &amp; we will definitely come back for more! \n<br />Potato pancake $4 - its ok but it seems abit burnt.
I like my rice cakes but there are some pieces that are harder than the rest.
Gem located in a secret corner at level 2 of Concorde hotel selling cheap and authentic Korean food. Flavorful with tinge of spiciness soup base coupled with generous servings of ingredients in the soup. Comforting for stomach on a cold rainy day. 
they used to operate at the basement food court, now they have a place of its own! $7.50 for this, you can choose 1 side dish provided. the meat serving was quite generous! anw i used direct translate for the korean words apologies if it\'s wrong! üòÖ #kimdaemun #dinner #koreanfood #spicychicken
Affordable Korean food at the forever-popular Kim Dae Mun. Especially love their seafood soup and spicy pork. Do note that they have shifted from the food court to level 2. 
Cheap Korean food for the win and it\'s around town area! Now you know where to find cheap Korean food in town. (:
This hidden gem preivously located at the basement of Concorde Hotel\'s food court has relocated a few floors up and expanded to accommodate the large following they have built. Do not dismiss this humble eatery, it dishes out superbly executed dishes like Kimchi Fried Rice, Bulgogi and Korean Rice Cakes. Go for the Spicy Chicken Soup Set, a fiery red soup filled with loads of ingredients and sweet potato noodles. Complete the meal by sharing a potato pancake. With nothing above $10, you won\'t have to worry about breaking the bank!
Seemed like they closed down the food court already when I recently walk pass... There\'s goes a place for good cheap Korean food :( 
Yum yum! Been a long time since I am back. Good economical korean dish!
Because I was craving for Topokki Îñ°Î≥∂Ïù¥ the past few days, and I missed my Korea holidays too much. Kim Dae Mun has always been my fave Korean food stall in town!

My favorite Korean place in town. $7.50 for this awesome spicy seafood tofu soup in a huge bowl.  To cope with the growing lunch crowd on weekdays, they now offer 10% off if you order between 11am to 12pm. Closed on Mondays.
All these add up to $26. It\'s my 2nd time here. I just don\'t really like the oily potato pancake, otherwise everything was good.

Kim Dae Mun serves one of the cheapest and good Korean food in town. You don\'t have to put yourself to worry for burning a hole in your pocket to enjoy such delicious cuisine which did not happened in many restaurants that are offering the same menu. Portions are pretty generous too!
End of holiday.

Once a popular stall in the food court at the basement of Concorde Hotel (now under renovation), Kim Dae Mun is now located on the second floor in the corner of the hotel\'s shopping arcade, holding it\'s own, and keeping up with its success. I came here during lunch hour. It wasn\'t as crowded as I was expecting it to be, meaning I didn\'t have to wait for empty seats, but considerably packed. My partner and I shared a bibimbap and hot plate chicken between ourselves. Everything was delicious. I can even gloss over the fact that the chicken (sliced into thin strips) was made of 50% fat. It gave me a very satisfactory meal at lunch and made me a happier person returning to the office, heheh.
