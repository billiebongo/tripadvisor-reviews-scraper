Finally poké comes a little closer to home 😍😍😍 $12.90 gets you a sturdy carton of either salad/ brown rice/ white rice and 2 choices of marinated fish in 70g portions each, plus a choice of 2 sides. My picks would be the original shoyu and the CRC salmon - the latter a short form of chicken rice chili; the cubes enrobed in a spicy sesame oil laden dressing - a perfect accompaniment to the hop heavy @StoneBrewingCo  GO to IPA
