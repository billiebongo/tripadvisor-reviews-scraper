They were really generous w the ingredients!
Definitely the main highlight of the day!! The meat was so juicy n tender one couldn\'t help but wonder if this was a dish straight from heaven itself! :)
One of the best seafood pancakes that I have tried in Singapore! If u have a grp of at least 4, order this to share as a \'side dish\'. 
This is something I like to try whenever I eat at a korean restaurant for the first time! Pretty decent on its own and actually quite good when eaten wrapped in the vege with the awesome sauce/paste! Of course, I still believe that the best Bulgogi can only be found in Korea itself :)
After mixing for abit, this dish was simply magical! The portion is quite big (can easily feed 4 - 6 ppl) n I was juz fishing for various items (hotdog, topoki, luncheon meat, tofu etc.) like a happy little kid :)
The Ginseng taste was a little too heavy for my liking. Also, in my opinion, the meat could be more tender. Overall still passable though :)
Happy full bellies!😋
👍🏼😋
When you have massive Korean food cravings to satisfy, you satisfy them well. Had the naengmyeon ($14.50), which is PERFECT for extra-hot days, the osam bulgogi ($19.50 - essentially a flavourful mix of grilled spicy pork belly + squid + vegetables), which we relished with lettuce leaves and gochujang, and the simple yet endearing rabboki ($13.50) for all you street food/K drama fanatics out there (me)!!

Hiding from the bad weather, with comforting food :)
