The Coconut Pie which has generous shreds of coconut flesh enveloped within the thin crust. It is held together by a moist, sweet paste. 
Loving the flaky crust of these pastries and they are very generous with the fillings!! It reminds me of the traditional pastry called 老婆饼. They are having a 5+1 promotion which is very worth it 🤑 It is priced at $2 per piece which is quite affordable. Worried about the overly sweet gelat fillings? This would be suitable for you 😌👌 It could be kept one day outside and 3 days in the chiller.
Swipe once  to reveal the flavours and twice for my personal recommended flavours. Had initially wanted to try the new Tokyo banana flavour but it was sold out when I headed down 😭😭 Thank goodness I managed to have a chance to try the purple sweet potato (failed attempt on my previous visit) which was amazingly good! 👍🏻💖 A must try if you are a fan of sweet potato with its thick, creamy filling that had a characteristic naturally sweetened flavour profile, luscious and pleasant. Thai milk tea also remained as one of my personal favourite (also a popular hit among many) that had a distinctive Thai tea flavour, coupled with a lingering aroma and subtle sweetness. Do consume these pies while they are hot/warm for better enjoyment. While I do fancy the outer layer of pastry crust that\'s crisp and flaky, I would prefer if it was thicker for a more balanced ratio of crust:fillings. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
My personal take is that Taro, Tokyo banana and Thai milk tea flavours are worth the try. Though my family prefers pumpkin and sesame. You can skip red bean and green tea. \n<br />It comes with a box if you buy 5 pieces. If not , it\'s put in this small paper pockets. At $2 per piece, this is so much more worth it than your pricey mooncakes.
Sawadee ka! Famous for their thai-style \"lao po bing\" aka wife\'s biscuit, April\'s Bakery has humbly opened a store at a quiet corner outside Tampines MRT Station (opp Tampines Mall). Freshly baked daily and available in 10 flavours, I was spoilt for choice seeing these flaky pies. 
At $2 a pop, these little tau sar piah-esque pies are flaky, brimming with a generous amount of smooth, rich, not overly sweet filling. Out of the flavours I bought, I felt that the Taro (tastes exactly like orh nee) and Black Sesame (pleasantly nutty and a little like red bean) pies were the best, while the Green Tea and Thai Milk Tea ones were very average and not flavourful enough.
Three Thai milk tea, two green tea and two purple sweet potatoes pie. The extra thin crust is a hit.
Pumpkin, green tea, black sesame, coconut and purple sweet potato. Warm upon purchase. Soft to hold. Thin flaky crust. Popular flavour sold out when reach there. Felt like Tau sah piah or Lau Po Bing. Addictive for yam paste lovers. Friendly cashier👍
((Even if it\'s at the other end of SG))
Buy 4 get 1 free for the month of may. We had 2 yam, 2 coconut and 1 thai milk tea. Jus had 1/4 of the yam Puff and omg it is sooooo sweet. The thai milk tea and coconut were way way sweeter. #burpple
Hailing from Bangkok, April’s Bakery has opened its first international outpost at Tampines MRT Station (facing Tampines Mall). The popular chain specialises in homemade pies that strongly resemble Cantonese style lao po bing (wife cake). At $2 a pop for all pies, this definitely makes a quick and cheap fix to quell those snacking pangs. There\'s also a wide variety of flavours, such as the best-selling Taro ($2), which Burpple Tastemaker Zhihui Lim claims to be outstanding with its flaky thin exterior and generously thick, smooth taro filling, complete with a whole gingko nut in the centre. Skip the lackluster Thai Milk Tea ($2) and go for the Red Bean ($2) instead. We hear savoury fillings such as Honey Pork and Honey Chicken will be coming soon! All pies are free from butter, lard and preservatives, so it’s recommended to consume within three days of purchase.\n<br />Avg Price: $4 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Tammy Wee
With so much hype surrounding April\'s Bakery, we decided to try it out. Our verdict: it\'s ok, buuuut choose your flavours carefully. 😂
Thought it was just another hype, but turned out to be pretty legit. Thailand\'s famed lau-po-bing-like pastries with flaky thin crust, generous filling and it ain\'t that sweet. Favorite flavour would have to be the Thai milk tea &amp; Taro. #burpple
Didn\'t have the time to wait for the new batch to be ready (in 15 mins) last evening, hence I made a preorder and collected this morning (they were still warm!) The filling in the taro pie tasted smooth like the traditional yam paste dessert. Thai milk tea tasted like pudding and the matcha does have a strong matcha taste (duh). Of the 3 that I tried, taro pie is still the best!
You can now try Bangkok\'s famous pie bakery here in Singapore. For $2 per piece, you can choose from variety of flavors like Thai Milk Tea, Green Tea, Taro, Pumpkin and more. Buy 4 to get 1 free. Located at Tampines MRT Station facing Tampines Mall.
🤤These are my favourites among the 5 flavours that I\'ve purchased. The taro that was just so smooth and soft; not too sweet. The green tea has, as expected, strong flavour. But since I like green tea, it didn\'t matter much to me. The custard reminded me of my favourite pie (Hopia Custard-Eng Bee Tin) during my childhood years in the Philippines that is so soft and milky. 😘
Located under Tampines Mrt is April\'s Bakery. It is served warm which came as a pleasant surprised to us. It is soft and gooey, a very different texture to what we usually have from pies. The pies we bought are green tea and taro flavoured. They are far from stingy will the amount of filling in each pie that the ratio of filling is more than the crust. The green tea flavour is rather strong and also brings a sweet aftertaste. The Taro flavour is sweet, creamy, and together with the soft and chewy ginkgo nuts, it alleviates the sweetness!\n<br />•\n<br />Jae preferred the green tea flavour while Kae preferred the taro flavour. Try and let us know which flavour you prefer!\n<br />⚊\n<br />#jaepluskaereviews
Got the taro pie just to try and it turned out pretty good, with flaky thin exterior and a very generous thick layer of smooth taro filling, with a whole ginkgo nut in it! So the next time we walked past we got other flavours like Thai tea, coconut, sesame and green tea. Wasn\'t quite impressed with the other flavours but it was good that they weren\'t too sweet. Definitely prefer the taro one. Do eat it fresh if you decide to try it - once it\'s cold it becomes chewy like mochi ?! and it\'s quite a mouthful with the generous fillings.
We tried a lot of flavours! None of them were too sweet, which was good. Our faves were the taro, pumpkin, and coconut.
Decided to check it out since I was rather nearby. They only a quite a few pieces on display, while most of them are placed in the kitchen, so do ask the staff for the availability of the flavours.
We got the Thai milk tea, purple sweet potato and taro flavors. Will try the others when there\'s a chance. Not bad. This kinda tasted like \"piah\" more than the pies that we are more accustomed to. #throwback #burpple #tingzieeats
Green Tea • Thai Milk Tea • Custard • Taro\n<br />Skin is thin, with sweet chewy sticky fillings (S$2 each).
Look. At. The. Generous. Fillings! 😍 These reminded me of Hong Kong styled 老婆饼 (Wife Cake) but with a heap ton of filling and so much more flavours. Also the skin was much more chewy than flaky, though I really enjoyed the interesting textures. I absolutely loved the yam/taro/orh nee flavour, because it really tasted like a real orh nee bowl, and it even had ONE ☝️ ginkgo nut hidden inside which was so chewy and added a different texture to the soft pies. I also loved the black sesame pie, which wasn\'t too sweet but had a distinct and robust black sesame flavour to it. The only one that was too sweet for me was custard - but I\'ll think it\'ll be a really good flavour to feed any kid - as my inner child was really pleased with how sugary it was. Get your hands on them fast, as they have a lot of other interesting flavours that are sold out pretty fast, like Thai milk tea, Sweet Potato and Green Tea. 
Think: thin flaky Chinese pastry skin wrapped around a laden assortment of filling, from purple sweet potato to Thai Milk Tea. While the starchy custard filling of the Thai Milk Tea, Green Tea and Custard got jelat after awhile; I loved the authentic tasting Purple Sweet Potato and Red Bean paste. \n<br />The buy 4 get 1 ongoing promotion (till end of May) lightens the hefty U.P. of $2/ piece, so try these Thailand pastries soon!!
Right outside the MRT.
Honestly we forgot how it taste like but we vividly remember that the left is their coconut pie and the right is a salted egg yolk pie. Till our next pie. 👋\n<br />⚊\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />▪\n<br />@aprilbakerysg #aprilbakerysg #igsg #singapore #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodporn #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #food #foodie #instafood #feedfeed #먹스타그램 #먹방 #먹스타 #yum #delicious #dessert #dessertporn #visualsoflife
Bought these pies from April’s bakery. Thai milk tea, matcha, custard, and mushroom. Very creamy fillings. I like the shiitake mushroom one the most. So much texture and the fillings are so yummmmy. #feedthetheme ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ✨#sgig #sgcafe #sgeats #sgfood #forkyeah #foodandwine #f52grams #sgfoodporn #instafood #food #foodie #foodporn #foodshare #foodstagram #foodspotting #foreverhungry #foodphotography #eeeeeats #foodgasm #burpple #onthetable #buzzfeast #huffposttaste #feedfeed #onthetableproject #bestfoodworld #devourpower
•\n<br />.\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: Personally I prefer old school Chinese pastries like Wife’s Biscuits and Tau Sar Piah. But at times, a change is always welcome like the newly introduced Vegan Friendly Mock Char Siu which tasted like the real Char Siu and Shiitake Mushrooms that’s peppery &amp; savoury. .\n<br />.\n<br />As for the sweet pies, my favourites are Taro Yam, Pumpkin, Black Sesame and Purple sweet potato as they’re not too sweet unlike the other flavours. Made with no butter, milk and preservatives.\n<br />.\n<br />Lunching their Signature “Meat Flavour” pies from Thailand soon like; Thai Curry Chicken Pie, Honey Chicken Pie &amp; their Best Seller Char Siu Pie. Word is their Char Siu Pie is already available in town. Their sweet pies are a hit &amp; miss for me, maybe I’d prefer their savoury pies more in which I definitely won’t mind giving it a try.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #aprilsbakery #aprilsbakerysg #pastry #pie #SugarCakePie #charsiu #vegan #shiitake

We’re trying the most hype Thai Pies in SG.\n<br />We’ve been long curious with all the good reviews about this and today we agree that this is a very nice pie!\n<br />We’re really in love with the texture. It’s thin crusty outside with a nice chewy layer plus custardy filling.\n<br />Now they have 2 new Vegetarian flavour:\n<br />1. Mock Char Siu Pies. When we eat this, we forget already that it’s a vegetarian! It’s really like a pork lard with char siu flavour. We’re really surprised this savoury taste goes well with this pie.\n<br />2. Shiitake Mushroom Pies. It’s remind us to the traditional steam cake (i forget the name). Yes, they manage to make a nice local taste into this 👍\n<br />We also try the sweet pies like Purple Sweet Potato, Tokyo Banana, Thai Milk Tea, Black Sesame, Taro with Ginko, and Sweet Egg Floss Pie. For the sweet pie, mr.Tastytested really love the Thai Milk Tea. It’s not too sweet and really have a nice thaitea flavour.\n<br />For me, i love Tokyo Banana most bcoz it’s even better than the real Tokyo Banana! Its custardy filling meets with the chewy texture is perfect 👌\n<br />Thankyou @aprilbakerysg for sending us this sweet treat ❤️\n<br />💰$2(each for sweet) ; $3(each for vegetarian)\n<br />📍3 Branch:\n<br />- Tampines MRT #01-31\n<br />- One Rafflesplace #B1-38\n<br />- Chinatown Point #B1-35 *the latest*\n<br />Rate (5/5)⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️-A MUST TRY-\n<br />#aprilsbakery #aprilsbakerysg #thaipie #pie #pielover #piesg #singaporefoodie #singaporeculinary #nomnom #nomnomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #igsg #burpple #sgfoddies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #sgig

The pie are air flown from thailand and baked here. \n<br />It\'s like the modern kind of lao po bing (wife biscuit), it\'s has  a thin layer of flaky crust with the filling filled with the orginal flavour of each ingredient and not forgetting the generous amount that is filled in it. 9.5/10 -\n<br />🎀 Taro with Ginkgo Nut\n<br />🎀 Purple Sweet Potato\n<br />🎀 Black Sesame Pie\n<br />--\n<br />Price: $2/pcs
🏵\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: Somewhere over the rainbow way up high, &amp; the pastry dream that I dream of, once in a lullaby, sadly is not a pot of gold or an array of April\'s Bakery\'s colourful pies. The Taro Yam will be your best bet. 🍠\n<br />.\n<br />Tokyo Banana flavour is exclusively made for SG but the banana is too artificial tasting. Green tea too sweet, Thai Milk Tea was decent. I Guess I\'ll just have to stick with my Traditional Wife\'s Biscuit (老婆饼) from an old school bakery. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #aprilsbakery #aprilsbakerysg #pastry #pie #sugarcakepie
A more convenient location to get these flakey custard-filled pastries!
On the other hand,the tokyo banana custard pie, legit taste like tokyo banana, the fillings are on point💯i would definitely for back agn for more goodness‼️‼️ #worthxyfoodie #burpple
Custard. Tokyo banana. #aprilsbakery #burpple
In love with these Thailand assorted pies. As others said, taro is the best! Is really like eating a very nice yam paste. Tokyo banana, greentea and thai milktea taste legit as well. Purple sweet potato only not sweet and a bit dry. \n<br />Reheated 30 sec with microwave before enjoy, perfecto. Hope they open  more outlets near west!\n<br />#aprilsbakery #pies #taro #colourful #breakfast #foodsg #burpple #igsg

Swipe to reveal the flavours featured here. Originating from Thailand, these freshly baked pastry pies resembled the famous Wife\'s Biscuit (老婆饼) from Hong Kong, with the crisp, crumbly pastry layers encasing the sweet, paste-like fillings. However, the version here differs slightly with a thin and mere pastry crust that contains a generous amount of fillings. The fillings were also smooth, creamy and soft unlike the sticky kind in Wife\'s biscuit. Among all the flavours I\'ve had, my personal favourite and ultimate bias is the Thai milk tea that was sweet yet bearing a fragrant Thai tea flavour with a lingering aroma. Following after is the matcha flavour, with a distinctive earthy flavour that could have been more intense and less milky. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#aprilbakerysg #nomnomsg #burpple #openricesg #eatoutsg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #setheats #cafehoppingsg #sgcafehopping #sgcafe #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #whati8today #sgfoodporn #officialfoodgroup #exsgcafes #projectweekends #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #instafood_sg #sgfoodunion #sgfood #TSLmakan #eatbooksgjyy\n<br />#smitteneats #smittenchoice
Heard that this chain is famous in Thailand. All pies are priced at $2 per pc. These are Thai Milk Tea and Green Tea pies. The filling looks sweet but it\'s not sweet at all.
