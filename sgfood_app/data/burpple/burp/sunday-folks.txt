Fresh baked and fluffy belgium waffles with savory lavender ice cream!!
Sea Salt Gula Melaka - the Asian sibling of salted caramel ice cream reminded me of buttery brown sugar and freshly baked cookies. Topped by crunchy caramel roasted almonds mikado and fluffy Gula Melaka mochi, it was the perfect sinful indulgence. 
The Raspberry Torched Meringue cake was delicious and the sponge was soft, but I found myself wishing that the flavor from the layer of raspberries was less muted. #burpple #sundayfolkssg
Run by the same folks behind Creamier @creamier_sg (One of my Favourite Ice Cream Bar, there are a few like @apiary.sg &amp; etc) 🍦\n<br />One can judge how well a Ice Cream Bar is by having their Roasted Pistachio, it\'s gotta be Fragrant, Smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. 🤤\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS &amp; GTK💮: Soft Serve is a type of ice cream that is softer than your normal ice creams due to the result of air being introduced during freezing. 🍨\n<br />Personally I prefer regular Ice Cream due to its texture &amp; richness. But recently, places like @wearesunday &amp; @matchayasg had me looking &amp; definitely tasting Soft Serve in a different light. 🖖🏻
Drizzled with a much needed Lemon icing, a generous sprinkling of lightly roasted Almonds slices &amp; French Lavender Blossoms. 💐\n<br />Served Warm, a good pairing with the Soft Serve. 😋\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Getting a seat here during the weekends especially with the Folks on Sundays (Just come at me Puns) is like fighting your way through a Mega Sale in a mall with all those aunties trying to grab the $5 panties &amp; bra. \n<br />So do yourself a favour &amp; do a reservation instead via @burpple or @chopesg. 🖖🏻

🍴\n<br />I\'m still dreaming about this Adzuki &amp; Madagascan vanilla trifle from last week 🤤 I usually avoid trifles because there\'s nothing exciting abt cream layers. But if it\'s SOFT SERVE layers, I\'m totally down for it! 🍴\n<br />The adzuki taste could be a bit stronger but if milky soft serve is your thing, it is definitely milky enough! The matcha white chocolate and fresh strawberries 😋😋 in the kuromitsu sauce was just sooooo good! \n<br />#burpple #sundayfolks #mondayblues #softserve
This cake (S$7.90) appears to be inspired from a carrot cake, except that the chef from Sunday Folks used sweet pineapples and bananas to replace the carrots, and give this style of cake a different definition. On the whole, it is not as sweet as typical carrot cakes, but the comment I have is... \"I did not seem to taste the sweet pineapples.\"
After I tell the world that I wish to come here for desserts, I finally checked off my wishlist of Sunday Folks.
This is one of my favourite ice cream flavours and it is truly fragrant and delicious too!
Their waffles and ice cream are truly one of the best indeed!
Headed to Sunday Folks to try and grab my grubby hands on the Adzuki Soft Serve but saw that they had this plated dessert on their menu which is limited to 10 portions daily — knew I had to get one since it\'s been quite a while since the last time I had played dessert.
Never disappoints. Except Earl Grey Lavender is still my favourite flavour.
This must be my upteenth time visiting the place and it still remains as one of my favourite dessert spots. Having tried nearly all the flavours offered, i am once again reacquainted with my all time favourite, Earl Grey Lavender. 
Sea Salt Gula Melaka Ice Cream with Handmande Japanese Dango with Gula Melaka Sauce &amp; Kinako Powder, Almond and Longan Biscotti. Our favorite waffles place and ice cream place. But today we only had a homemade waffle cone of ice cream. Cost: $18 per pax
Tried the Madagascar Vanilla sundae which comes with fresh strawberries and an almond biscuit topped with caramel sauce. The vanilla ice cream is one of the best that I had as it was very rich and creamy. The charcoal cone and sauce complements the ice cream very well too. This costs $7.90 before gst, quite expensive for a soft serve cone. Better off visiting Creamier imo. #burpplexchope
Roasted Pistachio Soft Serve (Ice Cream)on a Single piece of waffles (Petite) with Seasalt Chocolate Honeycomb (Topping).
Having freshly baked waffle with single scoop of hazelnut milk chocolate soft serve now sounds pretty enticing. Made of pure Italian hazelnut paste, French cream and 55% chocolate couverture, its rich and creamy plus am glad to find bits of hazelnut in it. We choose Gula Melaka Mochi to go along but found it lacking, perhaps other toppings will be more brilliant.
Sincere apologies that the photo is yet again about the soft serve. But what i want to talk about today is the cake. I gobbled the matcha cake too quickly for a good photo but it was great. I\'m glad I took the server\'s suggestion to try this out - flavourful yet light, perhaps hoped for a stronger matcha taste. Please give the cakes a chance too :) Quality is still the same since this place opened 2 years ago and I\'m glad I came back today #BurppleXChope

My almost-hump-day craving: Sunday Folks\' impeccable Belgian waffles crowned with a towering swirl of rich, nutty pistachio ice cream. Probably my favourite add-on that I won\'t ever stop ordering now that I\'ve tasted it, is the rose icing puff pastry stick – flaky, delicate, and tinged with a swipe of blush pink ☺️ .
$10 for this mouth watering dessert which was really one of the best waffles &amp; soft serve! 👻
Can\'t imagine they have such good waffle,outside is crispy and tender inside.Icecream is soft but strawberry was sour
Created too for the festive season in limited quantities daily is the \"Pistachio Chocolate Ice-cream Gateaux\".\n<br />A sleek bittersweet chocolate-coated dessert, it smuggles a ball of red berries sorbet within a dual-flavoured ice-cream filling of roasted pistachio and dark chocolate. That Excalibur of burnt caramel rice puff wafer was exceptionally munchable in my opinion.
A chorus of \"Mmmm\"s rose around the table once we took our first spoonful of the \"Winter Yuzu Ice Cream Trifle\" ($12++), a seasonal special at Sunday Folks.\n<br />The sunshine-like burst of the Japanese fruit in gel form, melded beautifully with the creamy Madagascan Vanilla softserve, fresh strawberries, cubes of fluffy sponge cake and citrus crumble for a most delectable result. By the way, the sprig of Shiso Hanaho flowers perched on top is edible too.\n<br />As this is limited to 10 servings a day, I suggest you go early if you don\'t want to risk missing out.
Double slices of waffles with cold custom ice cream flavour and custom toppings [$13] with a cup of hot cocoa [$6]
Absolutely in love with their desserts. The only downside is that it\'s so far from where I stay. Wish they\'d open another outlet since they\'re doing so well! 😬
Get the Earl Grey ice cream!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE HEHE
Waffles with their soft serve icecream at only $10-$15??? It\'s definitely worth your visit !😃 The ICECREAM consists of unique Flavours like lavender, pistachio etc😋 including toppings that you can select yourself!😃
Tried the Earl Grey Lavender flavoured soft serve and it was pleasant palate cleanser from the past few cafes :) with $12, one can get 2 toppings on top of some maple syrup and chocolate drizzle and of course the crunchyy waffles! Would really recommend this place and simply love the taste of the ice cream.
Headed down to Holland Village to try out Sunday Folk\'s newest flavour (which replaces the Passionfruit Soft Serve). Very nutty yet creamy; a good balance of both flavours that doesn\'t really feel particularly jelat even after finishing the whole cup (it reminds me of a lighter, creamier version of Venchi\'s Cremino in soft-serve form). Comes with toasted Home-Made Granola and a chocolate-dipped cookie — not to mention the bed of cornflakes that all soft serve flavours sit atop on at Sunday Folks.
It\'s a pity the roasted pistachio has more garnishing compared to other flavours. The stick was only nice at the part with the rose icing.. 🙊 What I don\'t get is, why do they fill their cones with cornflakes?? To prevent ice cream from leaking? But it totally ruins the experience... 😞 #Burpple #icecream #softserve
Tried the hazelnut soft serve which was light and nutty! It is quite expensive at $15 for 2 toppings though. The salted chocolate honeycomb provides a nice crunch and richness!
Price:~$15. Visited Sunday folks again to try something different. My friend and I got the hazelnut soft serve with 2 pieces of waffles and 2 toppings. We got the blueberry and buttercrunch(?). 
Love this place for its waffles and ice creams! We keep coming back here for more.
Regular waffles with Sea salt soft serve. Eat it fast before it melts! Super instagrammable place, but not so much a student wallet friendly place.\n<br />Ambience: 4/5\n<br />Student-wallet friendliness: 2.5/5 
We ordered a single waffle with Earl Grey ice cream and another with Pistachio ice cream. The waffles were nice and cripsy, at the same time moist and soft. Eating together with the perfectly flavoured ice cream is just... yum!
Waffles w Earl Grey Lavender Soft Serve ($10) 🍦\n<br />🍴Sunday folks never disappoints with their insta-worthy crispy yet fluffy waffles &amp; delicious soft-serve. The almond thins topping was a good choice ⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️\n<br />📍Sunday Folks, 44 Japan Merah Saga, Chip Bee Gardens, #01-52, S278116
The last time I ate at this place was around 2 years ago. It was amazing then and it is still amazing. This isn\'t cheap but it\'s worth the money. The only downside to this place is the noise level and its crowd. 9/10 (not much can be done to control it tho)
Recommended by a friend and I\'m supes glad to say that I\'ve gone there because if I didn\'t, I would have regretted it😱 It\'s sort of pricey? but most of the ice cream in Singapore has similar price (roughly $8+) I\'m definitely going to try more flavours! 
very good highly recommended \n<br />good place to chill out and correct place to get a good ice cream desert
Aromatic earl grey lavender soft serve w fresh blueberries, chewy nata de coco &amp; candied almond biscuit for added crunch! A great reward for the weekends 🌴 The black (chio) waffle cone I had tho was soft &amp; crumbly unlike the usual hard, crunchy ones which I preferred. Nevertheless, it doesn\'t deter me from coming back! I\'ll just opt for the cup or waffle selections 👽 #dayums 
Sunday Folks revamped their menu and I was a little sad to see that their strawberry flavored ice cream was replaced by passion fruit. Their waffles and pistachio flavored ice cream is still one of the best I\'ve tried and Sunday Folks is always going to be my go-to place cuz it\'s such a good cosy place to catch up with old friends! I had the matcha cake as well, but maybe I shouldn\'t be so adventurous next time :P 
Besides waffles and ice-cream, Sunday Folks also has some pretty good cakes! We had the weekday cake and tea set, which came up to $10.70 incl of gst. We ordered the recommended matcha chiffon w white choc frosting and osmanthus sencha pairing. Loved the cake!! The chiffon was very soft, light and moist, and even with the decadent white choc frosting, its sweetness was just right.
$7.90. The standard price for a soft serve in Singapore and this was definitely worth it. There were a lot of things that were special like the cone and the rice ball and sesame biscuit. The sea salt gula melaka was world class and tasted really unique even for me who does not tend to eat too sweet things. Only a pity that our climate makes soft serve melt too fast! But will always recommend Sunday Folks for its soft serve even though the queue was very long
Fluffy waffles, but the soft serve melts pretty quickly... Crowded so not much of an ambiance. Earl Grey soft serve not my style, i guess....
Got the two piece waffles w salted caramel ice cream💕💫 I wouldn\'t order to ice cream again bc it was too creamy and sweet. Gonna stick w the dark chocolate next time🍫 BUT THE WAFFLES THOUGH!! They are crispy and moist and super delicious💕 $12.90+1.50 was definitely worth it💁🏻
Added lavender jelly and salted caramel chocolate. Thought it was a bit overrated, esp at my second time here. And quite pricey. The waffle were not fluffy, and the ice cream wasn\'t enough for 2 waffles. Drinks such as their iced summer iced tea and a cup of hot tea cost $5.90. Seats were tiny, and not comfortable to stay for long. Yet the Q was long. 
Worth the wait and finally get to try their Waffles with Earl Grey Lavendar soft serve!! The ice cream is really good because the taste of the Earl Grey is just so nice. (I\'m having massive cravings for it again 🌚) The waffles are really good too. One of the best waffles that I have tried! 😋 
Earl grey lavender soft serve for Thursday dinner. 🙊 Because I have eaten too many samples at work and was craving for a sweet ending. 🐷🐷 You can truly taste the Earl grey with a hint of Lavender. The jelly w lavender bits inside was pretty cute but the blueberries don\'t really match. *shrugs* #Burpple #burppletastemakers #sundayfolks #softserve #foodiecam
We had brunch nearby and was looking for desserts. DailyScoops isn\'t open before 2pm, and we heard so much about Sunday Folks in Holland V. The little shophouse (perhaps that one used in MediaCorp\'s drama, \"Holland Village\") appeared as a minimalist front (I couldn\'t spot its signboard at first). We were greeted by a waiter who showed us to our table and was instructed to pass the table slip to the counter when ordering. We tried Earl Grey Lavender on Cone (pictured). The toppings were chosen by the staff, and were neatly placed all around the cone - blueberries, aloe jellies, glazed almond biscuits and corn flakes (love corn flakes with ice-cream). The earl grey lavender delivered a minty taste after a few mouthfuls. Though the chocolate waffle-cone tastes great, it quickly softens as the ice-cream melts. Perhaps we will try waffles the next time! Interesting concept and love the ambience. 
Back to try dark chocolate this time and didnt disappoint me. I liked that it was paired with popcorns 😋.
Not sure if it\'s me or just my luck but the waffles were a little less fluffy than I remember :( the soft serve summer strawberries was really nice though, it wasn\'t too sweet.
After hearing everyone rave bout it, i decided to give this a try with a friend. Was. Not. Disappointed. The waffles are fluffy and crispy at the same time, and the ice cream was smooth.
Weather so hot, so me n le bf went for something can cool off. We found this cafe nearby the Holland Village.\n<br />I love the ambience! N it makes me fall in love even more after I taste their ice cream waffle! \n<br />I chose the sea salt gula melaka ice cream and I loooooveeeee it!
I like crusty waffles so the square base delivered on that criteria (best would be the slightly charred types but that\'s my preference). The creamy roasted pistachio soft serve had a good natural nutty flavour. I went overboard with four toppings *twiddle thumbs*, but I do not regret getting the honeycomb and granola for added crunchiness!
Really keen to check this out after seeing a post by fellow Burpple Tastemaker Wei Zhi a few days ago. Released as a flavour to commemorate their anniversary, this new flavour replaces the strawberry option in the menu. Those who love their desserts with a tinge of zingy flavour would like this one; topped with a love letter and jellies, this smooth swirl of Passionfruit soft serve instantly refreshes the tastebuds with its bright, zesty flavours, whilst sitting on a bed of cornflakes at the bottom of the cup.
Ordered this for Daddy. He gave 2 thumbs up for this one. Very nice and refreshing. I thought it was just going to be a scoop of ice cream in a cup but this goes way beyond my expectations. Will come back again for more!
It\'s Sunday Folks\' birthday today and to celebrate that, they\'ve launched a brand new flavor ... Passion Fruit! As usual, the store was fully packed with people and a queue waiting for their turn. We got 2 complimentary cones of the new flavor from their social media promo. The soft serve was sweet and sourish, you can definitely taste the passion fruit flavor! It was topical, refreshing and perfect for the hot day! 
Decided to ditch the waffles this time and got the ice cream on a cone mmm can\'t get over how strong the earl grey is!!! It got a little too sweet after a while though :  ( it\'s best eaten with the waffles! 
I love Sunday Folks! Cone or waffle, I always end up with their earl grey lavender. Both pleasing to the eyes and to my mouth, any day can be a Sunday. 😚
Heard that earl grey is good so I went to try it, it is quite suitable for me as it is not v sweet or creamy!!¡¡👅
Worth to try! About $16 for the double slice waffles + ice cream + the toppings.
The waffles were really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I really liked the idea soft serve ice cream on the waffles, but I didn\'t enjoy the Gula Melaka ice cream. I\'m looking forward to trying a different flavour next time! :) it was $12.90 for a double waffle with ice cream, and $1.50 extra for 5 marshmallows (which wasn\'t very worth it) but they\'re very generous with the portion of waffles and ice cream. It\'s really crowded on weekends though so you might want to go on a weekday if you don\'t want to wait. 
For an extra three dollars go with the double slice. The waffles are soft on the inside, but crispy on the outside and will leave you begging for more. Paired with maple syrup and fruit, the flavor of a not so sweet soft serve blooms. 
I hate to admit this, but after eating Mochi waffles, my love for regular waffles has been greatly altered. I cannot appreciate them as much because I can only crave Mochi waffles. I do have to say they do make a pretty good waffle tho, crisp on the outside yet somewhat fluffier in the middle. But the soft serve - pretty to look at and lovely to eat.
Back for this yummy pile of goodness 🤗 Still prefer earl grey lavender or pistachio tho! 
Waffle was crispy and the pistachio ice cream wasn\'t too sweet! Just nice! They had maple syrup &amp; fruits given to every waffle ice cream :) added on caramel syrup &amp; they gave me quite a large portion 
Best earl grey lavender ice-cream I\'ve ever tasted. Super value for money too ☺️ #burpple
Personally found the taste of the ice cream a tad too overwhelming, waffles were okay. Went on a tuesday night, would say that it wasnt too crowded. Staffs were friendly and polite too. 
\"Served to me in a form of art I never seen, you brought my taste buds somewhere never been. The bond you made with your Belgian friend, got me thinking of a plan, to feast you with my two bare hands\" @thecravebuds
I think this is my best waffle pic yet \n<br />_\n<br />#thefoodjournalist
The Short Review
Price: about $9 for single waffle, $12 for double waffle. Verdict: would TOTALLY go back for it (to try the other soft serve flavor). Loved the soft serve earl grey lavender. It had a good aroma and it leaves a pleasant after taste. The waffles are also fluffy without being overly soft. We have also tried their gula Melaka soft serve but my friends and I unanimously thought that it tasted slightly weird. After all the gula Melaka taste is hard to grapple with. Can\'t wait to try the other flavor!
I\'m a regular at Creamier ice-cream and Sunday Folks has always been on my to-go list but only managed to try it out recently. I love the fact that I can have my favourite flavours in soft serve! While the pre-selected toppings were pretty interesting, it would have been even more awesome if they let us pick our own toppings. 
Love how they made the waffles thick and crisp (reminds me of the taste in A&amp;Ws when I was a kid). Legit pistachio flavored too. Even if you don\'t want any ice cream, just the waffle alone with honey is lovely. Customer Service: Great! Initially their machine for a flavor wasn\'t working and we couldn\'t get our first order.. But as soon as the machine was up, we were served one cup of it awww. Last thing: love the way Sunday Folks look into details such as placing a biscuit just below the ice cream, so to not let the melted ice cream ruin the waffle. Great effort there Folks!
Very nice waffles. Affordably priced too. The gula melaka soft serve and earl grey soft serve were a hit!
Bad service... There were so many servers but they seem to only circle around a certain part of the cafe. We waited for about 20 minutes and none of them approach us to ask for our orders.
Crispy waffles with a good serving of earl grey soft serve. \n<br />Service may be slow due to the traffic in the weekend.
The waffle is crispy in the outside and chewy inside. But i prefer wimbly lu\'s more idk why. Anyways earl grey soft serve really killed it!
Interesting to eat waffles with soft-serve, though I still prefer them with ice-cream! The waffles are as good as the ones at Creamier, and the summer strawberries soft-serve was smooth and delicious without being too overwhelming.
Gula melaka is spot on but 🍯 topping is too sweet after a few mouthful. Overall is ok but still prefer the lavender earl grey 😉
I realised that Sunday offer promotion for coffee or tea set with any sliced cake which cost only $10 which available during weekday until i read the blog of @misstamchiak.  Sunday Folk offer variety of cakes too many to list. I adore the Banana Walnut cakes It is just nice not too try cos when i eat normally Banana Walnut Cake doesn\"t taste without using original banana. Come down to Sunday Folk &amp; take a look at the variety of cakes &amp; pastaries.
Single Piece waffle with sea salt gula melaka ice-cream!   The waffle came warm &amp; the ice-cream is really good! Even for the hubby who doesn\'t eat ice-cream enjoyed! What is better than this? All for below $10! $9.90 to be exact! There is no GST or Service Tax! 
U can upsize to Double waffles Instead. In the end I share with @lepakwithyaops. I brought him Sunday Folk 1st time . Double Portion is more worth it if u are big eater cost u $12.90. Beside Waffles they are many type of cakes u can order too. Double Waffles u can only if u can finished everything.
Really crunchy waffles and would definitely recommend the pistachio ice cream. Strawberry icecream was alright and really sweet. Their waffles are a must try.
Especially the soft serve version in all its rich delectable nutty creamy softness. \n<br />Monster could swim in a pool of pistachio soft serve and get a nutty facial. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
This soft Serve ice cream is good combo it is mixed sweet &amp; savory. It is Good Combination with Waffles definitely gonna visit there soon when i am back again to @wearesunday .
This Cafe Serve Soft Serve Ice Cream.  U can have up to Double Square Waffles. U can choose the single sqaure waffles if u want.  We both order different flavour. i wanted to order the Earl Grey Lavender but it is sold out so choice order the dark chocolate. The Dark Chocolate Soft Serve Ice Cream is just nice not too sweet nice combination with the waffles. The price is reasonable but alot of people say this cafe is Atas. Single Waffles with Soft Serve Ice Cream cost u $9.90 Double Waffles wi with Soft Serve Ice cream cost u $12.90.  I am sorry @john.liam i went ahead with my fren 1st actually my plan was go there to celebrate my bdae definitely will go there with @candice.huang @debbiehuang @kenn_evans @mademoiselle.melo @huangshilin &amp; @johnsonhay celebrate my bdae when u are back.\n<br />Name:Sunday Folks\n<br />Address: 44 Jalan Merah Saga, Chip Bee Gardens #01-52 Singapore 278116\n<br />Operating Hours:1300-2200hrs Tues to  Fri . 1200-2200hrs Sats &amp; Sundays \n<br />Closed on Mondays\n<br />Last Order 50 Mins before closing\n<br />Tel:64799166
Be ready for 5-10 mins queue, very crowdy and noisy, however, waffle was pretty good but not the best
A little on the sweet side. I don\'t really like earl grey but surprisingly this doesn\'t have the strong earl grey taste. In fact, it has more of lavender.
Be prepared to queue - the queue came after I walked in. Noisy atmosphere but delicious ice cream. Earl Grey Lavender has just the right amount of flavour, &amp; the Belgian waffles were sufficiently crispy, although I wish they were served hotter. Honey drizzled on the side &amp; some fresh fruit were enough for me - no need for additional toppings although if you wanted, you could.
Earl grey lavender as great as usual. What surprises me is the matcha cake! It\'s so moist and soft and the cream cheese goes so well with it 😍
The waffles and soft serve was very yummyyy!  We ordered the yuzu cake, and it was ok as well. It is just a great place to chit chat with your friends and satisfying your sweet cravings.
I have always been a great fan of creamier and finally got to try their soft served version. My fav flavour - vanilla! U kno it\'s good when u can see generous amount of tiny vanilla beans swimming in it. Waffles is crispy on e outside n soft on e inside. This cafe is also much more spacious n comfy compared w e creamier branch. Just wish the ice cream would melt a little slower so I wount Hav to gobble the waffle. Haha. But I guess that\'s the thing about soft serve. 
I couldn\'t resist the urge to try Sunday Folks again! Today I decided to go with the Earl Grey Lavender &amp; Two Waffles ($12.90). The waffles were exceptional as usual, and I recommend this flavour to people who love Earl Grey, because the flavour was really strong. 
The madagascan vanilla was texturally professional - although for some reason an image of a Baygon can popped up in my head as soon as my tongue made contact - but it is likely to be one of Sunday Folks\' weaker flavours. Elsewhere, the legendary waffles were reliably magnificent in their sturdy crisp, and had nothing much else to prove really. 4.1/5 
Creamy and rich earl grey lavender soft serve, chocolate whiskey cake, sea salt caramel soft serve
A self reward after a full day of work, because this place is almost impossible to get in on weekends. I can see why, though.
Haven\'t been here for a nong nong time (heard news about the crazy queue as usual) - we came around 2pm so was pretty okay 😊 \n<br />Pictured here would be the staple Earl Grey Lavender &amp; Sea Salt Gula Melaka with waffles. \n<br />They seemed to have changed their piping of the softserve since the last time I was here - it\'s slightly wider and shorter (but inside was sadly hollow 😕) I have tried the Sea Salt Gula Melaka before, but I didn\'t liked it back then. But today, it seems to suit my taste surprisingly 😋
The waffle is so so only... I\'ve had better. But the ice cream is not bad! Flavor of pistachio is strong 
Somehow I like to think of myself as a big eater sometimes when I obviously can\'t finish most of my meals. Oh wells.
Ice cream is smooth and light and with the cereals at the bottom tast good! I like it that it doesn\'t make you feel heavy on stomach after :)!
Must try the earl grey ice cream. The waffle is crispy too. The yuzu cheesecake is light and not overwhelming. 
The ice cream is not so milky enough and the cake is too dry for me. Didn\'t try the waffles though but it\'s too overrated in my opinion
Waited 20mins in the queue. And order Earl grey lavender and summer strawberries. 8.80 for petite size. Absolutely worth for the long wait, and the travelling part. 
Dark Chocolate Soft Serve &amp; Waffles ($10.50) + Soufflé Cheesecake ($1.90). The waffles here were amazing. With just the right crispiness on the outside and softness on the inside, I couldn\'t stop myself from devouring the whole thing! The Dark Chocolate Soft Serve had loads of flavour, and it was a little bit bitter which I loved because I like dark chocolate. The soufflé cheesecake was a top up, and I think the price of it could be lowered! But other than that everything else was great! 
The waffles are good but they are not the best in Singapore. Earl grey lavender ice cream, however, is perfect imo. We tried the dark chocolate praline tart and it was yumz | earl grey lavender ice cream x waffles $11.80; dark chocolate praline tart $7.80
Because once wasn\'t enough, I went back for more. Speaks a lot for a person who doesn\'t repeat most of her cafe visits because there are many more out there to try. And I\'ll be back for more! 
After 2nd coming, we manage to try it. Earl grey lavender ice cream with waffle. Ice cream was nice, waffle so so but overall a good exp if u don\'t have to q that long  
Sunday folks definitely for their waffles and desserts. Not the best cup of flat white though. If they served awesome coffee, wow, it would be like the best combi ever. 
5-Jul-2015\n<br />♡ The rich pistachio flavour and cereal surprise at the bottom!!\n<br />☆ $7.20 (cup)!
Each scoop comes with pre-selected toppings. You can choose from standard toppings to premium toppings if you would like to have any. The earl grey lavender ice cream reminded me of Gryphon Artisan tea. Both of it are my favorite which is the best of both worlds. Oh don\'t get me started on the crispy yet soft in the inside waffles, alongside, sweet summer berries with chocolate sauce &amp; maple syrup to complete it 😍
It\'s Gula Melaka overdose here, won\'t really recommend this as it is very overpowering, only those who loves palm sugar.
Nice ambience with friendly staff. Desert is great and I would recommend everyone to try their Earl Grey flavor! Looking forward to next visit.
We all know that June hasn\'t been a good one, well at least for me. July will be better, I hope!
Waffle is crispy and yummy. Ice-cream served in big portion as can be seen from the photo. $11.80 for 2 waffles if i\'m not wrong. Did not particularly enjoy the drink though. I\'d suggest just stick to the usual coffee/mocha/chocolate.
At least we know that their ice cream and waffles are not limited to being good on Sunday\'s only. I had the seasalt gula Melaka and my friend got the dark chocolate. Presentation is definitely a 9/10. The food was a 8/10. Crispy waffles with a moist inside and really good soft serve ice cream. Their best sellers were the seasalt gula Melaka and earl grey lavender however I liked the dark chocolate better. Almost every waffle parlor I go to has seasalt gula Melaka and earl grey lavender I don\'t think it\'s that unique anymore but the dark chocolate... That was really good. It actually tasted dark. Slightly more on the pricey side selling at $8.80 for one waffle and soft serve ice cream whereas other places sell at the same price for two waffles instead of one. But it\'s safe to say it was worth the money. I\'ll be coming back soon!
Back here after a few months one sunny afternoon and was happy to have gotten a seat relatively quickly!! The hype seems to have passed and while its still popular, it\'s no longer crazy, and my waffle arrived within 5 minutes after I placed my order. Still good as before - a waffle that\'s crisp on the outside paired with refreshingly light earl grey soft serve. Polished this whole thing myself sitting in a corner and felt immensely satisfied.
Crispy yet not a fuller waffle which good as it doesn\'t make a flourish feeling. Earl grey lavender ice cream was recommended to be an ice cream choice. Smell of the earl grey ice cream was as good as the taste of the waffle
Definitely worth coming here! The tall swirl of soft serve Pistachio ice cream here were pretty good with the yummy waffles that come with a mix of fruits and hazelnut sauce/maple syrup. However! There are better pistachio flavor out there to me but this place is definitely worth a go 😊\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
The ice cream I had (sea salt gula melaka) failed the impress. In fact it tasted like a particular cardboard-y rye cracker. How I wish I could bring the waffles over to eat with Daily Scoop\'s ice cream!
This cost $7.20 with 3 toppings included like blueberry,honey almond and lavender konyaku and the latter taste so special and good👍however be prepared to queue if you want a seat in the cafe to enjoy yr dessert.Overall its a pleasant dessert to indulge in once in a while😊
I always, always go back to this. Should probably try something new, but why argue with perfection? 😂
All my life, I\'ve avoided pistachio ice-cream like the plague because they tasted nothing like the real thing. Until the day I had a sample spoonful of the roasted pistachio soft serve at Sunday Folks. It\'s a world of difference compared to all others before (and after) with its nutty fragrance and most importantly, authenticity in taste. My $7.20 order got me a big swirl of the soft serve upon which chopped pistachios were scattered and a sugared puff pastry stick was stuck into. Underneath all that, at the very bottom of the cup, lay a small pile of cornflakes which was, I swear, the best possible match ever for the creamy pistachio ice-cream. 
REALLY REALLY LOVE HOW THE WAFFLE IS SO CRUNCHY N FLUFFY!! The vanilla ice cream n the waffle taste great alone but i dun think they match well together😕 On the other hand, it was definitely worth the wait (1hour++)
I can\'t believe I\'m actually going to try the famous sunday folks waffles!!!
One of those highly raved dessert cafe, well it definitely deserve the popularity!! If you like soft ice cream with strong flavoring, sunday folks is the choice guys. The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect match with the ice cream :) probably go during non peak hours, to avoid long waiting time.
My first time queuing for an hour just because of dessert , but it\'s worth ! 
Definitely one of the best ice cream waffles I had, other than their sister shop Creamier @ Toa Payoh. Love their Earl Grey Lavender and Chocolate soft served ice cream. Crispy and soft waffles are definitely the plus point for you to visit Sunday Folks! 
Choose from a range of delectable gourmet soft serve ice cream together with crunchy but fluffy waffles. A perfect dessert to end off your meal in the Holland Village area.
I LOVE THE WAFFLES! PISTACHIO ICE CREAM IS ALSO SUPER GEEWD!
The soft-serve ice cream really helps this place to stand out from the sea of ice cream waffle cafes. The consistency of the ice cream is just right - it\'s soft, but not too melty, and holds its shape and form as you\'re eating it. Because it\'s so soft, it\'s super shiok to slather it on the warm, fluffy waffle and stuff it in your mouth. The waffle itself is light and airy, and it\'s so good that I could eat it alone. No wonder there\'s always a long queue outside! While it\'s not one of the cheaper options ($12 or so), I would say that it is worth the price. Everyone should try this place at least once if you\'re a waffle fan!
Now I understand why the queue is so longgg. Love their sea salt gula melaka soft serve!
Earl grey lavender ice cream &amp; Freshly Baked Belgian Waffles paired with strawberries, blueberries and drizzled with maple syrup &amp; chocolate hazelnut sauce + Popping Candy chocolate mikado 》$13.70
I genuinely thought this place was going to be overrated before I actually made a visit down, but the waffles ($8.8) here are really crispy and fluffy at the same time! Many people recommended the Earl Grey Lavender Ice-cream and all I have to say is that you should seriously go for it! It tastes exactly like your regular Gryphon tea! (Picture features Pistachio though!)
The waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside BUT the main star is definitely the roasted pistachio!! I tasted the \'roasted\' in the roasted pistachio ice cream, which blew me away. And there are little bits of pistachio nuts on the plate too!!
Two square waffles stacked up together and topped with a tall swirl of soft serve. 
We ordered two slices of waffles with the earl grey lavender/ vanilla ice-cream. It was really good! 
Think this is a better option as their cone can be pretty soft.
But you may want to not take a picture with it because it melts really fast. But I would say it is worth the hype and I wouldn\'t mind queuing!! #deliaprecioclub #ntudac
But you may want to not take a picture with it because it melts really fast. But I would say it is worth the hype and I wouldn\'t mind queuing!!
Pretty place, pretty plates, pretty desserts. But I still like my waffles with ice cream. 
Successfully got something from here on a weekend, which was an accomplishment on its own (even though it had to be a takeaway order). Oh, melts quickly.
Anyone who\'s on Instagram would probably have come across Sunday Folks\' ever-picturesque soft serve on waffles. You can find Creamier\'s signature flavours such as Roasted Pistachio, Earl Grey Lavender, and Sea Salt Gula Melaka in soft serve form. Choose to add handcrafted toppings like nama chocolate, gula Melaka mochi and soufflé cheesecake to complement your soft serve and waffles, but if you get it in a cone, toppings are included. The space is very pretty but usually packed, so it might not be a good idea to hang for long!
Of the 3 flavors we ordered (Earl Grey Lavender, Salted Gula Melaka and Roasted Pistachio), Pistachio is the only one I liked. Their waffles are also mention-worthy, being crispier and among the better ones I\'ve had.
Spending our Sunday at Sunday Folks.
I doubt this needs any introduction. On the other hand, the customer service was 😒
Okay so these are probably one of the best waffles I had in singapore before. I think I got the lavender earl grey flavor and omg it was literally perfffffection. The queue is pretty long on weekends but I went on a weekday so it wasn\'t as bad tho it was still pretty packed. Oh and trust me, u will NOT be disappointed after having these unforgettable waffles. 
That\'s half a tub of B&amp;J\'s right there. There\'s a faint aftertaste of lavender to the soft serve but the earl grey overpowers the entire thing I found this quite hard to enjoy. I\'ll stick to Creamier instead. #burpple #marshmunch
If you are looking for a light and refreshing ice cream flavour, Sunday Folks\' Earl Grey Lavender soft-serve should be the answer. It had a light floral taste to it and the pre-selected toppings such as the almond thins complemented and brought texture to the treat!
Thankfully service was quick in spite of the crowd. We waited no longer than 10 minutes for everything to be served. Loved the ice cream but found the cone too soft. Also, my cone was filled with cornflakes. Felt a bit cheated.
Waffles with toasted marshmallow, nama chocolate and berries. Love the ice-cream! Very nice earl grey flavour 😌 ! Not too heavy! 
Cause we can\'t wait till Sunday.
A stellar combination - earl grey soft serve with a generous sprinkling of salted caramel honeycomb pieces!
Crispy outlook with fluffy inner texture. Ordered the summer strawberry ice cream with sea salt chocolate honeycomb. :)
3 munchies: The dish would have tasted as good as it looks only if the waffles were fluffier on the inside and sea salt gula melaka ice cream were creamier and less icy. While it was great that they have a wide selection of toppings and provided good service, I\'m not sure if it was worth queueing up for 30 mins and another 25 mins for the waffles to be served.
Second stop today is to meet the folks from Sunday Folks on a Sunday. It\'s best to eat ice cream when the weather is cold. The Waffles with Earl Grey Lavender Ice Cream ($8.80) is officially one of my favorites now. 
Great flavor of the pistachio and not that sweet. Ice cream is the highlight. 
Waffles were fluffy and chewy, sweet with a slight caramelised glaze! Though the sheen made the waffle to cut as it quickly cooled down. Love that the soft serve was smartly perched on a biscuit, as I don\'t like soggy waffles. It was SO CROWDED, be prepared to queue! Service was fine, but was (politely) indirectly suggested to leave after finishing my food 😞
It\'s been quite sometime since I last came here. Exactly 1 more month till my trip. Counting down.
Soft serve ice cream Gula Melaka seems to be the favorite. Rating👎 cos I the soft serve melt too fast for enjoyment. My rating system. 😍 shiok must return 😜 shiok only if you are in the neighborhood 👎don\'t bother. 
I\'m not sure if the pistachio is anymore roasted than I am under the sun.
Went back for their waffles and glad that they now offer Petit-size waffles which comes with only one piece of waffle for smaller appetites. Waffles were pretty good today; crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle with buttermilk flavours, while the Sea Salt Gula Melaka soft-serve was pretty rich in its palm sugar flavours. Also impressive was the chocolate and caramel drizzle on the plate; it gives the waffle a bitter yet sweet goodness.
Rich and creamy strawberry soft serve topped with fluffy cheesecake cubes and scarlet red sweet strawberries. Tasted a little like Haagen Daaz\'s Strawberry ice cream which is great. 
Slightly on the pricier side (this was about $10+ for one?) had the strawberry ice-cream with sea-salt marshmallows. Toppings were skimpy but it was yummy! Ice cream was deliciously smooth and creamy and waffles tasted just like the ones you get at Creamier (Toa Payoh)! Queues were crazy long though I waited about 45m-1h but I would say it\'s somewhat worth the wait! 
Finding lavender ice cream?? Sunday Folks will be the right cafe to head off to! 👍
finally got to try sunday folks !!! love their softee and really tasteful icecream :) tried 1) earl grey lavender icecream with cheese souffle topping, and 2) sea salt gula melaka icecream with chocolate honeycomb topping 😋 their waffles are really GOOD 👍👍 (better than creamier\'s, hahaha.. but i rather creamier\'s icecream 😝) #satisfycravings
I know I\'m slow, but I\'ve finally gotten my ass to Sunday Folks! Had the Earl Grey Lavender and Sea Salt Gula Melaka, and I loved them both. Now I understand why all the hype 😍🍦
The hype surrounding Sunday Folks has always fascinated me as I plough through countless photos of these photogenic waffles on Instagram. The photos were certainly sufficient enough to awake the waffle hardie in me. 
Sea Salt Gula Melaka soft serve ice cream with waffles. Love the texture of the ice cream but the coconut flavour was a bit overwhelming. Was expecting a little more fragrance for their well known waffles. I guess I set my expectations too high giving the popularity and demand of it.
As with its ice cream parlour (Creamier), the soft serve from Sunday Folks did not disappoint :D
Expensive but I must say that I would prefer having the soft serve here than the ones HoneyCreme/Honeycomb/Milkcow/DanmiSoft any time despite its high price. Smooth and creamy soft serve that\'s pretty nutty in flavour served with chopped roasted pistachio nuts that\'s not only just nutty but toasty. They also have since changed their operation hours for weekdays to open at 1pm instead of 4pm.
Constantly-packed Sunday Folks gives all an indication of just how popular their waffles and soft serve ice cream have become. Creamier\'s signature square waffles are now topped with a swirl of soft serve that comes in their most popular flavours -- Earl Grey Lavender, Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Roasted Pistachio. You can also choose to enjoy your soft serve swirl in a handmade cone, and choose from an assortment of toppings like matcha nama chocolate, Japanese mochi and fresh fruit. Be sure to complete you experience with a hot cuppa. Tip: you want to have your camera ready before your waffles/ cones are served!
I like the earl grey lavender ice cream too &amp; the toasted marshmallows 😍😍😍 Luckily didnt have to wait too long... would come back again for more! Thanks @scarlettqian for accomdating to my last minute request!! #vscocam #sundayfolks
Something on almost everyone\'s Instagram nowadays - Sunday Folks exploded into the scene as a spin off from Creamier with 8 of their signatures flavors done in a soft serve. There\'s a slight revamp to their menu since the last time I came down - you get the option of choosing a \'Petite\' waffles with ice cream which means getting just 1 waffle instead of the usual 2. 
Regular waffles at $11.90, drop by on weekdays and they have a $10 deal which includes a coffee/tea with a slice of cake! 
What better way to beat the pre-Monday blues than with the awesome Earl Grey Lavender Soft Serve on their signature waffles? Photo by Burppler Yuting Pang #Burpple
Heady with yuzu fragrance but I wasn\'t a fan of the slightly stodgy texture (could be the amount of gelatin used).
Roasted Pistachio soft serve with regular waffles and added toppings of sea salt chocolate honeycomb and soufflé cheesecake. Roasted pistachio flavour and the consistency of the soft serve is done right but I do not like it that the soft serve melts too fast :( 
The Short Review
Pistachio sofetie on a light and.crispy waffle can you ask for more ?:p
Laid back dessert cafe.sinful. Quaint place to have a catch up session with your friends
The waffle is crispy, the ice cream is also nice but for the queue time like that, I think it\'s not worth it..
Definitely worth waiting. Single waffle with ice cream is $8.90. Sea Salt Gula Melaka Soft Serve and Earl Gray Lavender Soft Serve are the popular favours here. Additional topping Nama Chocolate is $1.90.
Because it was served warm, the zesty citrus flavours of the cake bloomed in full lushness. The lavender seemed happy to play a supporting role; lingering softly in the background.
A much more pleasant and comfortable place to enjoy waffle and ice cream than Creamier.😀✨😋
Sister company of Creamier. The soft serve goes well with the waffles, reasonable price with no gst/service charge! &amp; yes, it\'s always so crowded, been there twice and it\'s always filled with ppl! 
So late but I finally tried this! Waffle was good, crisp outside and soft on the inside. It paired well with the sea salt gula melaka soft serve that I picked. The fragrance of coconut was delightfully prominent in the soft serve, and it was not overly salted. It melted really quickly though, as soft serves do :( I\'m also happy to say that the chocolate sauce and honey on the plate were not only pretty, but tasty too :)
Freshly churned Earl Grey Lavender ice cream paired with handcrafted toppings. Decided to have it served in a cup, rather than in a cone or on the waffle. Bring me more desserts please.
Thumbs up to the folks for introducing the new queue system where you can input your contact details into the iPad at the door.
Love the Strong Pistachio Soft Serve with crispy waffle and legit maple syrup. Clever idea of using thin crispy wafer below the Soft Serve to prevent it from being soggy.
The ice cream was exceptionally good, bringing out the aromatic flavour of earl grey. Waffles were done perfectly- Crispy on the outside while fluffy on the inside. Must try!
Awesome soft serve w/ waffles. Waiting time can get a little long during the weekends.
Paired with White Chocolate Coconut Mikado and served in handmade charcoal cone
I\'m not a big fan of softserve ice cream because it\'s too creamy &amp; mild for me and it melts real fast. But, I should say I love the waffle. Crispy and fluffy although the texture is not quite even in the middle part. Quite stingy with the torched marshmallow but, sigh, I can\'t complain much because other places also charge higher than this. Nothing wrong with giving in to temptation I guess.
Crispy waffles with earl grey lavender soft serve ice-cream that melts way too fast. So, a very creative friend decided that we should deconstruct it &amp; turn it into soft serve wafflewich. This makes it easier to eat! 
(Nov 2014) If you have not tried Sunday Folks before, I urge you to do so because they are one of the only places that live up to the hype. Their waffles are in such good shape and embody a nicely crisp texture. I had this with their Earl Grey Lavender softserve which was superbly fragrant and also potent in flavour. It\'s been ages since I went there. Perhaps this calls for a return visit soon? 😬
Not sure I\'m a fanboy of the waffles per se (given the sheer number of widely available substitutes it had better be encrusted with diamonds to justify the long wait and braving the frankly too buzzy and \"haps\" dining environment) but the earl grey lavender soft serve was memorable and I loved the topping selection (I had the torched chocolate peppermint marshmallow and gula melaka mochi). 4/5
Ordered the classic waffle with gula Melaka ice cream. Got to say that this is probably the best waffle I\'ve eaten in Singapore so far. It\'s pretty crowded though so expect quite a bit of waiting (though I was fortunate enough that there were seats available) 
Single waffle w earl grey lavender soft serve, almond thins, handmade gula melaka mochi &amp; popcorn
Sea salt gula melaka ice cream in a cone and earl grey lavender in a cup. The Gula melaka ice cream has a strong coconut taste to it. Earl grey lavender is a little too sweet.
I went on a Saturday. The 40min+ queue was ridiculous. The amount of 20somethings queuing with me was ridiculous. I\'m 37 and felt ancient. Then queuing again to order, why? Was it worth it? Absolutely. A must try. Just a bit cramped and noisy. Too many kids :)
Real sweet and salty at the same, with the coconut flavor throwing a punch. Waffle was okay and fruits did helped to balance out the strong mixtures of flavors going on. 
Burpple classifies them as top 100 places to go in Singapore! Located at Chip Bee Gardens. Opens at 4pm and the cafe is fully occupied once they open their doors! Maybe you might not even make it on the first round if you reach on the dot. YES! It is this crowded on a weekday!! Brought to by the owners of creamier.. I\'m seriously impressed how they uses technology for customers to get queue number and how are they being notified when it\'s their turn. They have lotsa varieties of toppings to go together with the soft serve! A lot!!! Waffles must be eaten while it\'s hot. Best waffles? Erm.. I can\'t say it\'s the best but I don\'t dislike it as well. If it\'s air-ier, I would adore it. Just a personal preference thingy. If you like it abit more doughy then this is for you.
Though other tables may have been staring at me, as I was all alone, ordered a few items. By myself.
Crisp waffles and delicious ice cream, totally worth it! Ordered the waffles paired with ice cream ( Seasalt Gula Melaka, Earl Grey Lavender and Madagascar Vanilla ) for $10.50 each 
Affordable price ! Waited for 15-20 mins. Worth the wait ! The ice cream was really soft ! Waffle was freshly made!
Crunchy edges, fluffy middle, and creamy cold swirls mmmm it\'s a yes!!! Consistently good waffles and the most fragrant soft serve accompanied by all sorts of toppings 👍🏿 What more can I say, been here so many times and Sunday Folks never disappoints! 
Earl Grey Lavender soft serve with double waffles. Glad to see Sunday Folks have improved the soft serve formula as the flavour is stronger than the first time I went! (1 mth of their opening)
Finally got my soft serve fix. Crazy crowds even on a Friday afternoon. 
A bit of a letdown probably due to the overhype. Nonetheless worth a try if wait is not long
Eating Earl Grey Lavender is like having perfume in your mouth; the fragrant floral notes take over as the soft serve melts in your mouth. Waffles are great too, the egginess and fluff makes anyone happy!
tried almost all the flavors and cakes :) left gula melaka and the toffee cake
Sip of hot mocha and match cake on Saturday. A bit too crowded and waiters not attentive enough. 
I\'m impressed with their earl grey ice cream on waffles. Really good ! 
I first saw this place in instagram and decided to try out this cafe near Holland Village. I didnt have to wait long before I was given a table for 4. The place is cool and the staff are friendful. A nice place place for gathering with friends and family.
Worth the try. $13.70, a plate for two to share 😋
Earl Grey lavender soft serve @ Sunday folk - Holland v. \n<br />This cafe, is one well known place considering it\'s \"ulu-ness\". Crazily packed with people plus a long long line at that. I\'m super sua gu but the electronic queueing system and subsequent operator call that you get informing you avoid the availability of seats is kinda, beyond awesome \n<br />Anyways I digress. So this place is well know  for it\'s waffles with soft serve, but unfortunately, the waffle wait time is perpetually 50mins - 1hour.  Which is absolutely ridiculous. So we didn\'t have any and settled with the ice cream. \n<br />While it\'s pretty pricey, this soft serve ice cream really does not disappoint. @bbarneyy, jun and I took a mouthful and were like OMG EARL GREY.  SO NICE! The flavour is perfectly concentrated yet sophisticated and well complimented by the fragrant hints (OK maybe more than hints) of lavender. Their ice creams are generously embellished with an assortment of toppings depending on the flavours, so don\'t need no opt for extra toppings. The almond crunch that comes with this favour is phenomenal. It\'s sweet, nutty gooey and crunchy all at the same time. ♡☆♡☆ If you thought daily scoops Earl Grey was good, this one tastes even more like Earl Grey. The cone on the other hand was nothing to shout about, fragrant but not crispy enough. In fact I was quite \"lao Hong\". But whatever, the ice cream makes up for itt
I just love that earthy, mellow, and slightly savoury quality that roasted pistachios have, so that even though the soft serve is airily light, it packs so much robust flavour – definitely my favourite here so far (I\'ve yet to try the highly raved Earl grey lavender). But while the fluffy cubes of Japanese cheesecake were well-done, I can\'t help being appalled that the cost of this addition works out to 50 cents per tiny cube (each is hardly bigger than a blueberry!). 
Sea salt gula melaka freshly churned ice cream concoctions prepared with handcrafted toppings.
Madagascar Vanilla 
Waffles x Roasted Pistachio Soft Serve, topped w/ blueberries, strawberries, w/ an additional Nama Matcha premium topping ($11.80 + 1.90) 😍😍 Really love the soft serve! 
A good bedtime dessert, sweet and soothing with a little surprise inside the cone just before the last few bites. 😋#earlgreylavender #icecream #soothing
Waffles are not as good as the creamier ones. But their soft serve ice cream is a good try. Good flavour of Earl Grey with tinge of lavender. It\'s a little too sweet to my preference. If you have a sweet tooth, order one of this and end your day on the sweet note! 
A little bit too sweet, will go back to try out other flavors.
After a full day filled with turkeys and little else – we carved our way through 23, no kidding, I could really do with some happy food. 
How about a sea salt gula melaka soft serve (with waffles) from sunday folks? =D
Finally managed to snag a table after 30 minutes of waiting, and this heavenly creation didn\'t disappoint. The gula melaka soft-serve was too sweet after a couple of mouthfuls, but it did have that burnt caramel flavour that made it very fragrant. The pillowy waffles, crisp on the outside and comfortingly gooey inside, were just perfect, as were the chewy, half-melted cubes of toasted marshmallows.
Waffles were as fabulous as I remembered from Creamier! The sea salt gula melaka was disappointingly strange though. Definitely prefer Creamier\'s version. Liked the spaciousness of this outlet, though it gets really crowded, but the queue system helps | ★★★☆☆
Earl grey lavender ice cream with waffles! In love with their soft serve ice cream 👍
\"There is no greater treasure in this world than somebody who loves you as you are.\" ―Eric Micha\'el Leventhal
Hahaha. Waiting for my brunch~ *hungreeee*
Sunday folks have been the hype over at Chip Bee Gardens recently. Is it just me or anyone didn\'t like the free seating system too? Feelin\' the pressure while having my waffle cuz ppl will start surrounding your table and 😳 at you.
Pretty good waffles but I personally prefer the strawberry icecream to the raved over earl rey lavender icecream
(sister company of our fav waffles cafe Creamier) Waffles w Dark Choc Soft Serve Ice-Cream $11.80 + Summer Iced Tea $5.90. Shiok.
The waffles are good (yay for how fluffy it was on the inside). The soft-serve were generally too sweet for my liking but I loved how aromatic the earl grey lavender soft-serve was. I\'m guessing it\'d be an acquired taste to most people though.
Just the right amount of sweetness in a rich flavour, and complemented with crispy waffles, the ice cream waffles here are a must try! Personal favourite flavours here are Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Earl Grey Lavender.
Sunday folks icecream with waffle is the best. Waiting for seats might be a fuss during peak hour but good dessert are worth the wait.
Waffles were soft and fluffy in the middle, crispy at the corners. Paired very well with the Madagascar vanilla ice cream which was light and leave you wanting more. Will I be back? You bet! 
I really like the concept that they\'re using soft serve ice cream instead of scoop as all of the others waffle did. The Sea-Salt Gula Malaka &amp; Earl Grey Lavender is a must try! Waffles are priced at $11.80 and ice cream cone are priced at $7.50 with different additional prices for the toppings. The only bad thing is the crowd!! :( But I\'ll sure definitely coming back here to try their other flavors 👌
If you haven\'t tried this yet, you should go for this: how often do you find earl grey lavender ice cream with toppings that complement it so well - jelly, blueberries and crackers! Definitely a must for anyone with a sweet tooth.
It\'s neither a Green Tea or Wasabi Soft Serve.
Kinda disappointed by the soft serve being a tad tad tad many tad too sweet 
Glad that ours arrived under 20 minutes and managed to get our craving satisfied.
Sister outlet of creamier. If you are a fan of soft served ice cream, this is the place for you! 
Maybe Japan spoilt me with their soft serve,  but does anyone else feel that the soft serve is not creamy enough ? Expected more from the Creamier folks, whose ice creams are so rich.
They proved themselves well why they are the hype of the town right now. Pretty interior with spacious space for an ice cream parlour. What\'s not to ❤
Just want to wish two of my friends a very happy birthday! It was nice knowing you and all the best for your future! Meet up soon :) happy birthday jasmine and shuyu
Soft sponge cake with chocolate fudge.  So Chocolatey good!!!! me love 😍😍😍
Amzingg roasted pistachio soft serve in a black charcoal cone, dusted with crushed pistachios and finished with a sweet pastry stick. 
Loved the setting of Sunday Folks, it has truly a whimsical setting and is a nice place to really relax and take a break. Think sea salt waffles and everyone will certainly think of Sunday Folks, the sea salt waffles is really good and the chocolate waffles didn\'t lose out to it either! Perfect place to relax with waffles for the tummies!
I was quite amazed at how packed it was even on a Wednesday Afternoon, queues reaching the door, patrons waiting for the next available seat. But when this sexy plate of Belgian waffles with Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Nama Green Tea ($11.90) landed, after a massive bite, I understood the cause of the madness. BY FAR THE BEST WAFFLES IVE EVER TASTED!!! (And I\'ve tried Stranger\'s Reunioun Alr) 👍👍👍👍
Went because mum wants to try. Keep saying wanna try wanna try. So we came to try. And all I wanted was the hot cocoa. //
Earl grey lavender soft serve with waffle and additional salted caramel honeycomb (premium topping - $1.90). I am always a fan of Cremier and when I knew this place is opened by the people behind Cremier, I need to try it. The waffle is as good as Cremiers\'. Love the earl grey lavender soft serve. Can\'t get enough of it. 
Freshly baked Belgian waffles paired with strawberries, blueberries with maple syrup and chocolate hazelnut sauce drizzled over a scoop of their best-selling flavours (we chose the Seasalt Gula Melaka). We also added handmade gula melaka mochi and nama green tea to our waffle creation. \n<br />What a great post lunch dessert! 🍦🍵🍓😋
Earl grey lavender x pistachio x dark chocolate on waffles 😍😍
The much raved waffles was mediocre instead the yuzu cake impressed me. Good to go on a weekday to avoid the frenzy crowd. 
What\'s not to love about their soft serve? Tried the Earl Grey Lavender &amp; it\'s amazing how the taste of Earl grey lingers yet isn\'t all that strong. Topped with their own concoction of toppings, it\'s a surprise of taste with every mouthful! Contented yet again! 😁 
It looks so photogenic, so good. And it tastes even better :-))) 
Understand the hype and why it\'s number 3 on the top 100 with the soft serve so good and waffles better than the one at toa payoh 
3rd time here in 5days. Loving the earl grey lavender soft serve and the matcha cake. 😋
its its a hot hot sunny sunday. tried these pistachio soft serve yet? yeapp sunday folks ain\'t exactly serving ice cream, more like a softer version of ice cream. really loving these flavours but de cone could do with a bit more work. a tad soft and you can\'t feel the crunch a cone should give
This time with @s_wei and @lyntwl Kinda disappointed that they do not have any earl grey lavender ice cream and waffle left. 😔
Another overhyped place. Maybe coz I\'m not a fan of soft serves 
my favourite flavour to win me over. the mochi was meh though.. improving since it last opened. 👍
Topped with Seasalt Gula Melaka ice cream! And guess who I met here at Sunday Folks? @dashtaz
Hand-pulled espresso coffee with beans purveyed from fine local roasters.
The soft serve is pretty good, but it melts real quickly as compared to the ones at creamier.
Perfect night to end the week, expect to wait about 30-45min for those damn waffles with the overwhelming crowd. Come early to order and grab the ciders as well; $13 for 500ml of goodness. 
Earl grey lavender icecream and waffles topped with chocolate mochi, nuts and berries. Is a new cafe opposite holland. Atmosphere of the cafe was good but not much seats especially if you come in group. Luckily I only went with one of my friend so we found a seat easily. 
Not because of the waffle but the inconsiderate crowds dining there, mainly because there isn\'t a proper queuing system even thought it\'s free seating but those waiting started to stand around and wait beside your table (just like the hawkers scene). Secondly, despite the crowd, the ignorant bunch of people decides take the chairs away from one table to theirs, leaving only the table available. Staff were busy and it took awhile to get hold of their attention.
First try was sea salt gula melaka. Decided to get in cone instead. Their cones are made of charcoal. There\'s 3 toppings by default for each different flavours. 
Photo-worthy waffle with Soft serve ice-cream in a more spacious setting. 
Finally got the chance to head down for my dose of waffles at my fav ice cream parlour! Yay to delicious waffles, their standards really didn\'t drop much. Sadly, the soft serve didn\'t look as pretty as others cause it was tilting till it almost toppled ): but still good nonetheless! I wanna try the other varieties! 
Waffles with earl grey lavender soft serve with an extra serving of sea salt gula melaka. Waffles was perfect. One of the best I\'ve ever eaten. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The crisp sound as the knife cuts into the waffles makes your mouth water if the aroma from the freshly made waffles doesn\'t. Only thing is that the ice cream melts too quickly. Just after 5 min of trying to get the perfect picture, the ice cream on too of the waffles started to droop. Earl grey lavender was great, but might lean towards \'overly-sweet\' (but still loved it!) while the sea salt gula melaka was maybe a tad too overpowering and sweet for my liking. The flavour was well-induced though, and my friends, one of whom might be biased towards anything sea salt-sugar flavored, loved it. 
Came back to try the other flavours! Their soft serves in cups comes with default toppings, thus can\'t be customised with preferred toppings. Salted Gula Melaka came with a Sesame cracker atop, which was crispy, fragrant and packs a crunchy texture to the smooth soft serve, along with chewy Japanese mochi balls. Soft-serve itself was stellar; smooth and flavourful as the signature sweetness of Gula Melaka was evident through the coconut flavour, yet the saltiness was neutral so it does not become cloying. Will be back some day for this again!
They did told us when we were ordering that it will take that long. While waiting, one of the serving crew came over and explained to us why its taking so long. Seems like the waffle making machines which they got here are new and even though it is the same as those over at Toa Payoh, it are working as well. Thus taking them so long to make and ensure those that are being served are of good quality. \n<br />Turns out quite good although not as good as those at Toa Payoh.

Really like the texture of the soft serve ice cream! Will be back to try the other flavours and cones :) Heard from one of the waitresses that the cones are handmade. 
Waffles served were really crispy on the outside and yet moist on the inside. Every bite brings out it\'s flavour to the fullness, especially with the soft serve of salted gula melaka! 👍
This is easily one of the top waffles in Singapore, from the people behind creamier. Didn\'t like the idea of free seating though, ppl end up standing around your table while waiting. 😰
Great place to chill (but super expensive add on) 5 chocolate nana for $1.9
They had roll cakes too!
soft serve was yummy! there are better tasting waffles out there tho..
Since the ice cream version was (IMO) the best, we decided to give the tea a try. It was good but would be better in a pot (quite pricey for a cup).
Sorry wasn\'t very impressed with this as I was with the other two yesterday. I ordered vanilla because I thought it would be impressive if they could make it special.
I\'ve always been a fan of Creamier, but it\'s just quite out if the way for me. This sister outlet of the popular latter is the latest up-and-coming ice-cream spot. Imagine customised soft serves on waffles or cones with plenty of toppings to choose from? What a dream! Ordered my favourite earl grey lavender flavour (aside from my other favourite: roasted pistachio), topped with lavender konnyaku, gula melaka mochi and berries on crispy, fluffy waffles, which never fail to disappoint. I adore this beautiful flavour as every mouthful is packed with a deep, intense floral taste. I also tried the matcha roll (not pictured). The cake\'s texture was light and fluffy but the tea flavour could be stronger, in my opinion. I\'d like to try their other in-house baked cakes the next time! Another perfect spot to satisfy my soft spot for waffles and ice-cream- these folks do it well. 
Waffles with Seasalt Gula Melaka!
Earl grey lavender cone! Subtle flavours and you have to try the lavender jelly!
Similar to the one from Creamier.
Love the brown sugar sauce and the mochi, a nice Japanese touch.
The difference between Sunday Folks and Creamier is that Sunday Folks also offers cakes. The Matcha cake was light and fluffy, and was rich in green tea flavour. A definite hit for matcha lovers!
Loving the combination of their signature waffles and the soft serve ice cream! 😀👍\n<br />#burpple
Sunday Folks is by the same people behind Creamier, which explains why the waffles look so similar. I personally prefer the waffles here over Creamier\'s because they are more fresh and crisp on the exterior (maybe Creamier is just too crowded). Unlike Creamier, only soft serves are available at Sunday Folks, and the flavours are more milkier and less rich in comparison but therefore achieving a lighter taste as well. We added Noma Green Tea for this one, which was cubes of white chocolate covered in matcha powder.
Honestly I had never enjoyed Creamier\'s coffee for they were always bitter and burnt, but Sunday Folks does theirs a lot better. Not only was it creamy, it was roasty with nutty accents. Definitely changed my impression from previous visits at Creamier!
The people behind creamier have now opened a new dessert cafe at Chip Bee Gardens (Holland village). West siders rejoice!!! Don\'t have to travel all the way to TPY for waffles anymore!!! They also make their own cakes now. Tried the matcha cake ($7.5), albeit pricey but at least it tasted good. Salted Gula Melaka soft serve with waffles and something honeycomb (can\'t remember): waffles that comes with maple and chocolate sauce and berries was just dope but the soft serve is just not enough!!! I usually have 3 scoops of ice cream at least 😂😂. Coffee beans are from liberty, served in pretty blue theme cups, I\'m sold. Hehe. So glad I manage to come here before the crowd comes!
waffles ŵ seasalt gula melaka soft serve. soft serve ice cream was good but was melting too fast #sgfood
Sparkling drinks paired with waffles, best combination. great and peaceful ambience! 
Absolutely HAD to make a trip down to this place over the weekend to devour their crispy waffles and delicious soft serve ice cream after seeing pictures of it online. Their earl grey lavender and roasted pistachio ice-creams are divine. 
This Earl Grey Lavender soft serve with Lavender Konnyaku Jelly was soooo gooood, I\'m definitely coming back again to try their cones and other soft serve flavours! Woots! Hope everyone is having a super sweet Sunday too! 🍦
Creamier\'s sister outlet, Sunday Folks, serves only six flavours: summer strawberries, roasted pistachio, earl grey lavender, madagascar vanilla, sea salt gula melaka, and dark chocolate. Get it in either a cone (comes with toppings) at $8.90 or on two glorious waffles at $10.90! Quality still remains excellent, and I have to say I definitely love how the ice cream feels lighter \'cause it\'s a soft serve. I also much prefer the space here as it\'s so much roomier - less shoulder rubbing! 
You\'re going to want to head here before word gets out. As if Creamier\'s waffles and ice cream weren\'t picturesque enough, the folks behind Sunday Folks have outdone themselves. They\'re still serving their signature flavours such as earl grey lavender and roasted pistachio, but - wait for it - as a soft serve in handmade cones. Customize your cones with various toppings like matcha nama chocolate, gula melaka mochi and fresh fruit. Or have your soft serve atop their famous waffles if you like. This space is much roomier, but it won\'t take long before a queue forms.
This is a totally W.O.W experience during the first bite, never a place amazed me with fine quality waffles till I\'ve met this. It\'s really extraordinary and balance the taste well with the combination of sweet and salted which many fail to meet. This is a place you should visit when you\'re at the heart of holland village!
With much assurance given by the main barista that I spoken to. With his general knowledge, I agree and his coffee was definitely well-pulled and this will be my new destination that I will be patronizing for coffee at the quieter side of Holland Village. 
The gentleness of the tea is the highlight of this soft-serve. Served atop their crispy, fluffy waffles, this does feel like Sunday.\n<br />-\n<br />It’s Sunday everyday with Monster and ice cream!\n<br />-\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #sundayfolks #burpple #iluvsg #icecream

Azuki ice cream gateaux with a dollop of kuromitsu sago, a globe of hazelnut milk choco ice cream paired with warm black sesame financier, orange marmalade and coconut milk foam. Garnished with matcha soil, edible amaranath leaves, pea tendrils and flower petals.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />It is a very small delicate dessert. The azuki ice cream was sweet but was tapered down by the acidity and zest of the orange marmalade. My favorite black sesame financier had a nutty consistency and provided the so needed crunch. Looks dainty. Finished it in a flash.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Only 10 of this plated dessert are prepared each day upon order. \n<br />#dessertlovers #desserts #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #stfoodtrending #8dayseat #sgfollowers #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #nomnom #instafollowers #tpasg #spring #sundayfolkssg

What you don\'t know is that strawberry number 3 conveniently slid off the cone right after this photo. ⛷
Not too bad, but a stronger hazelnut taste would have been better. As for the waffles, they are consistently good, so thumbs up for that! 👍🏻\n<br />I must say though, they really need to do something about their crowd control. It\'s terrible. You get a queue number and wait to be seated by one of their staff. While that makes sense in theory, the execution was poor. Many a time there would be multiple empty tables that remain empty for a long time, even after it has been cleared. I understand that perhaps they could have been short staffed, but nevertheless wait time could have been reduced significantly if the system was more efficiently implemented. ⏱
Their waffle is definitely on point! Crisp on the outside, light and chewy at the same time on the inside 😋😋👌🏻\n<br />.\n<br />#letsnomnomSG #sundayfolks #foodporn #foodpics #foodbeast #burpple #singapore #onthetable #wheretoeatsg #hugrygowhere #cafesg #foodsg #icecream #waffle #softserve #dessertbae

Another one of our favorite from @wearesunday Where are you getting your dessert fix today? 😉
Macha sponge cake white chocolate sponge cake with hot mocha
kinda similar to a trifle.  Sweet Madagascan vanilla ice cream with soft sponge cakes. Lying snugly beneath is the fruit of the winter, japanese yuzu made into cubed gel and surrounded by strawberries with added crunch from citrussy cookie crumbles.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />A refreshing burst of flavors. It is sweet, tangy and very zingy. My favorite was the yuzu which gave that pleasant sourish and citrussy finish. Coupled with strawberries, it left an invigorating zesty explosion on the palate... something which I relished on a hot afternoon.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />I think I prefer to savor this without the sponge cakes. The degustation desserts ($12) are only prepared upon order and only 10 sets are available each day.
Definitely the one for chocolate lovers and I really like this more than their usual dark chocolate flavour.

Must commend the entrepreneurial spirit though. @limmeted @marckhapa #burpple\n<br />PS: got a free 💍 ad!
Second trip here and tried the sea salt gula melaka this time! Added the sesame thins as toppings which made the entire set more flavourful and sweet!  #sgfood #burrple #cafehopping #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igfoodies #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #vscocam #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgig #sundayfolks #foodgasm #foodsg

Tasty waffles!
Perfect combination of cold ice cream and warm crispy waffles！Can\'t wait to try the other flavours! Hang in there everyone, it\'s mid week soon💪
It\'s almost as big as his face!
Earl grey lavender and summer strawberries swirl. Can say i am addicted to their waffles! Q for almost 30nins to get a table for 4. Well worth it!
BUT the ice cream melted really fast 😰

#EarlGrey Lavender #icecream with these delicious #waffles. I love the texture of these waffles! Finished them so quickly! #WafflesForDinner #sgfoodie

My friend asked if we can only have that only on Sundays? Apparently not. There\'s an insane queue for this sister branch of Creamier. Is this worth the hype? I couldn\'t even get a table to try their waffle.
Earl Grey lavender ice cream serve with waffles... nice!
Bold statement but no doubt the best waffles in Singapore imo

Pistachio is a definite fave now!! #sundayfolks #waffles #softserve #saturdate #yum #foodporn #omnomnom
