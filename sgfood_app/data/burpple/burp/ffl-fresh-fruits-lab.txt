Thick beef patty with sunny side up, will definitely fill your tummy!
If you are a scallop lover, should try this pasta. The pasta sauce goes well with the scallop and pasta! Yums
I see having brunch as a treasured luxury, so it made me very happy when my brother decided to take me out for brunch today before an afternoon of studying and driving lesson! Adding on to that joy was a reasonably priced brunch fare at a unique scientific-ly themed cafe that takes pride in their fruits garnish and juices. Fresh fruits lab serves some good egg bens and decent pancakes! My brother was all for the egg bens, going on about how he\'ll definitely come back for more. \n<br />For me, the crust edges of the stack of 3 pancakes were delightful, however the incorporation of berries within the batter could have been omitted as it made the middle mushy. Overall worth an order especially when the pancakes were still good on its own without the syrup! Definitely hope to be back to try their other mains! 
The well-cooked pasta was professionally and evenly lubricated, with the tantalising aroma of oink notably present in the proceedings and (as I asked for extra spicy) a wicked, searing chilli padi heat, so delicious that the prawns admittedly tasted a bit deflated and self-conscious amidst all the aglio olio swag. 4/5 
Loved the eggs florentine, their English muffin is so crispy unlike many others. Coffee to me is meh. 
Found a cafe that is quite near my Neighbourhood . (Got direct bus number 2) The burger taste so good same goes to the fried mushrooms . The portion is quite huge so don\'t order too much if you are a small eater . Will definitely head back to FFL again . Not to forget the staffs will give you a tube of fruit juice for you to drink and freshen yourself from the stuffy weather . 
We ordered grilled fish from the set lunch list and Da Bomb Burger - they were really good! Complimentary cold-pressed fruit juice was served and we ended the meal with mint mocha. Totally enjoyed the meal, being fascinated by the decor around us and enjoyed the pop music that was played... it was raining cats and dogs and I felt so bliss being there chatting with Loved One and simply just chilling!
Easily one of the best prepared poached eggs I\'ve had in Singapore. Ooziness level 💯 
Delicately plated with Baked Half Scallops topped with Sunny Quail Egg and Cavier Masago. Spaghetti was cooked to al dente, and wholesomely infused with the taste of Masago Cavier. Half Scallop was well seasoned and baked to perfection; not too hard and chewy but instead light on teeth. The dish is a little heavy on taste some might find, but this dish definitely suits my taste bud, someone who enjoy seafood and prefer food with heavier flavors!
The chocolate cake was perfect and not too jelat. Tea had a unique taste :-)
Fish was a tad salty for me but the chicken was amazing (im sorry I really cannot remember the dish name). The side order of truffle fries was amazing (my love for truffle fries knows no boundaries). Second post coming up. 
Complimentary samples of freshly-squeezed fruit juice were served in test-tubes along with water in beakers. Pasta was good, and so were the strangely addictive mushrooms.
A place to consider for a chillax brunch or evening. Have not tried their brunch menu before. However dinner menu was so-so only.
Fish &amp; Chips ($19). The concept of this restaurant was really creative, serving ice water in beakers and fruit juices in test tubes! But the food is kinda pricey. 
Beautiful rainbow cheesecake, cute lab crockery for your food &amp; drinks, test tube juices and 1-for-1 beers. Definitely worth a visit and I will definitely be back! 
set lunches at $12++, cool lab-inspired glassware! haven\'t used pyrex beakers and test tubes since college
250g of beef in a burger! Might as call this a quarter kilo burger! The meat was well cooked and juicy! But the bread was dry.. And the fries were too salty. For $19.90+ it was okay. Big enough to share!
Super cheesy and for $10 you get 6 juicy and well marinated meatballs in baked cheesy marinara sauce! :) a great appetizer for sharing!
Dined at FFL for a celebration! Generous serving &amp; tasted really good!
Apple carrot juice! *cold pressed juice*
Rainbow cake as the main spotlight
Interesting place serving drinks with cool apparatus! This place serves fresh fruit juices and offers a pretty extensive menu. There\'s even steaks done new Ubin seafood style! It\'s great to see more cafes/ bistros opening up in the east. This place just opened a month ago.
Have non-stop Korean drama \"marathon-ing\" for a quarter of the day.. Sudden craving for food to fill my stomach but there\'s so limited food at home.. Found this place through random search for food places near my house..\n<br />First time trying carrot cream soup, quite flavorful and feel the slightly rough texture of the carrot puree; love the crunchy croutons.. The red colour sauce tasted like red wine sauce, which I think can drizzle into the soup itself though..\n<br />Salmon fillet is placed on a bed of mashed carrots in a nicely decorated plate.. The salmon fillet is a little overcooked (a bit hard) but still acceptable.. The salmon fillet is \"on fire\" though, but unable to capture the flame.. The soft-shell crab pasta tasted quite decent.. Thought it would be better with real crab meat inside the sauce as well..\n<br />I quite like the tea-infused cake though.. The taste of tea is right on the dot, not too little or too overwhelming; cake inside is not hard or dry.. The mango supreme cake is not too bad as well.. Both cakes are not too sweet.. #fflfreshfruitslab #carrotsoup #salmonsteak #softshellcrabpasta #teainfusedcake #mangosupreme #burpple #dinner #latemealoftheday #caloriesoverload #toolatetoburnoff #jaslynfoodinstagram

This is more than just a piece of otah sandwich. The thick finger of otah is full and spicy enough even for people who don\'t take chilli, and at the same time enough for one, good for sharing for two. I concur with the chef\'s recommendation.\n<br />#food #foodphotography #foodstagram #burgers #sliders #otah #otakotak #freshfruitslab #burpple #foreverhungry

久仰很久的FFL，突然心血來潮就跑完步和朋友去吃～真的不辜負我的期望👍🏻他的三文魚凱撒沙拉和推薦（忘了？）的漢堡🍔真的料實在，滿足的了我的大胃口，而且一坐下去他就招待兩瓶可愛的混合水果汁跟我們Nice🎉

Awesome fish and chips here. 👍😉
I loved the truffle infused scrambled egg as it was perfectly cooked, moist, soft yet springy. The fragrance of the egg was beautifully enhanced by the truffle oil. I was pleasantly surprise by the bacon wrapped pineapple. the sweet-sour pineapple neutralised the grease and saltiness of the bacon, making each bite well-balanced, yet exciting. Other than the above mentioned, I would say that the rest of the breakfast set was rather unexciting. I will be more incline to order the eggs and the bacon wrapped pineapple only (if possible) the next time I am there. #openricesg #nomnomsg #burpple #igfood #foodporn #sgcafe #cafehoppingsg #ilovemyfood #fotd #foodie #foodgasm #nomnom #food #yummy #hungry #dirtyeating\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />On a side note, it\'s going to be a week of clean eating. Am considering posting my #cleandiet menu here. What do you guys think?
Kinda regret ordering the Mint one as it tastes kinda toothpaste like, I\'m sure the fruit flavored ones will be much better. Nevertheless, it is really soothing for my throat! Time for another 2 hours of nagging social studies content and writing skills. #cravingsatisfied #nomnomsg #openricesg #burpple #ffl #freshfruitlab #drinks #nua #tutor #socialstudies #science
Shortly after, I spotted the chilli sauce in the background and gleefully reached out to help myself with it!

The food tasted pretty normal and nothing out of the ordinary. It was just a little aesthetically better than other foods and cafes because of its unique concept
Irresistible wings that are fried to perfection. Super crispy on the outside and yet maintains its juiciness inside, topped with chicken floss. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodunion #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #eatoutsg #setheats #igsg #sgfoodtrend #burpple #throwback
The Fish and Chips [$19] looks simple but the batter was good and the fish was fried to perfection. But the highlight would definitely be Da Bomb Burger [$19] which is really Da Bomb! The beef patty was well done but still maintained its juiciness. The bacon was also very crispy and juicy, just the way I like it. Both mains came with fries and fruit salad. Love the fruits and greens as the side but can\'t say the same for the dressing drizzled over it. For small eaters, this hearty burger meal can fill the stomach for ✌️. The orange juice [$5] was a feeble attempt to offset the guilty calories from the meal. Closed on Mondays. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #sgeat #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instadaily #eatoutsg #burpple #burger
