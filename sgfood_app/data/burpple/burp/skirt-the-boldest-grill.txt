Accompanied by black pepper ice-cream (never imagined black pepper + ice cream could co-exist in such wonderful harmony) and sesame crisp.
42 degrees Celsius confit + spiced cashew nuts + pineapple vanilla rum jelly + cilantro butter gel. The very exclusive fish. 
The courses here are of the leave-lots-of-empty-space-on-the-plate school of thought. Usually, this scares me because the more arty the dishes, the less I tend to enjoy the food. But Osia is different. They serve food that is very refined and pleasing both to the eyes and tastebuds.\n<br />I found the 3-course set dinner I had to be of excellent value for the quality, and every dish tasted absolutely divine. It commenced with a pan-fried foie gras starter that had an unusual but amazing banana, vanilla and rum sauce. For my main, I chose the perch, and was very pleased with how the simple preparation allowed the fresh, firm, flaky flesh of the fish to take centrestage. Dessert was fixed and there was nothing else besides the \"Valhorna hot chocolate soup and pepper ice-cream\". Sounds weird, doesn\'t it? But trust me, this signature dessert of Osia\'s will knock your socks off like it did mine. Last but not least, there\'s complimentary coffee or tea. Nowadays, this meal-closing hot drink is conveniently omitted from many set menus which means you need to pay for it if you want one. I am therefore, glad that it\'s still done the proper way here.
Lurking just below the layer of chocolate soufflé is a luscious lagoon of decadence. With a gentle nudge from my spoon, pure, rich and deep Valhorna chocolate in lip-scalding liquid form is revealed. I can\'t ask for a more perfect counterbalance to this than the creamy vanilla ice-cream that contains just the right hint of pepper.\n<br />There\'s no doubt about it, this dessert that\'s made with the utmost finesse, ranks as one of the most memorable I have ever had.
I swear that stone hearth of theirs is a magic machine. This is such a perfectly cooked piece of beef - so buttery soft and delicious. Having tasted it, I have no choice but to return here asap and order either the largest hunk of beef or the most fat-marbled one that exists on their a la carte menu. Which means it is a toss-up between the 300gms of Grainge Black Angus New York Steak (MS 2+) or the Mayura Station Matsusaka Signature Full Blood Wagyu Rib Eye (MS 9+). Meat heaven awaits!
This was one of the appetisers in the Iconic Set Meal. The 42-degree confit style of cooking the piece of boneless trout resulted in fish that\'s clean and fresh tasting, and melt-in-mouth tender. Giving an exotic lift to it was the pineapple vanilla run jelly, spiced cashews and cilantro butter gel. If you get it off the a la carte menu, it is $26++.
It was hard to decide which flavour of the signature made-from-scratch flat bread to go for as they have such interesting options: onion sour cream, curry coconut, dukkah, garlic butter, macadamia pesto and truffled kalamata olives. Eventually, I chose to have a half and half of the last two. Baked fresh in their specially built stone hearth, my flat bread arrived with a pat of butter, extra virgin olive oil and most interestingly, a tube of smoked eggplant paste. I found the bread to be very tasty without any help but even lovelier with a squirt of the excellent smoked eggplant. 
Been returning to this place for years for their bomb stone hearth oven flat bread bursting with flavour, but more importantly their hot chocolate soup (choc fondant /molten lava cake) served with black pepper vanilla ice cream is magical and the best I\'ve had!
Diners can look forward to the exquisite set dinner menu put up together by Chef Tim and Osia restaurant. \n<br />This was the Cauliflower Soup with Quail Scotch Egg, Pickled Mushroom and Truffle I had last evening. For a limited time only and a Not-to-be-missed special dining experience, please call Osia for reservations or visit my blog for details.
#Dessert was \"Cherry Ripe\" - another invention by Chef Montgomery which is brilliant. According to @elsiecheong , it had all the hallmarks of a good dessert (from Masterchef) - crunchy, soft, sweet, tangy, cold and warm. I don\'t normally like dessicated coconut but it\'s brilliant with cherry and chocolate. This 3-course soup, sea bass and cherry ripe dessert for $90++ is avail till this Sat only! Full review on my blog very soon!
This is Chef Tim Montgomery rendition of the well-loved Australian chocolate bar Cherry Ripe, a perfect combination of Chocolate, Coconut and Cherry. What a splendid way to complete our night.
Chef Tim understands a woman in and out, wonderful textures and for a lack of a better word, delightful! #foodporn #sugarrush #osia
The first of 3 of Chef Tim Montgomery\'s \"Cooking With Friends\" menu at Osia. Till this sunday! #osia #foodporn
Featuring the elegant Sea Bass, with Brandade, organic egg, smoked potato espuma and Avruga caviar. Only available at Osia from 16th to 19th July 2014. Don\'t say I never tell you!
THE BEST, softest and moistest well-done steak. Creamed sunchoke + Basil Cepe + Acquerello Rice + Tomato Parmesan + Red Wine Sauce $66++
Rounding up the Greenfields lunch with their new product launching end 2014, and a top-notch dessert of whipped lemon ricotta in a light, crispy tube of pastry with orange spiked chocolate ice cream and chestnut paste. 
Lots of things on a plate and all of them delicious. The fillet of sea bass had the crispiest skin ever, even while the flesh remained tender and not in the least overcooked. Flanking it were chorizo bits in lobster vinaigrette, saffron mashed potato, smoked salmon slivers and marinated lumps of bocconcini.
Looks scarily green with all that basil purée it\'s cooked in, but this was quite delightfully earthy, with a briny raw oyster to star; squishy cubes of mozzarella added texture. 
Wasn\'t expecting a tomato soup this rich and sweet, elevated by a light, slightly foamy mozzarella espuma and musky extra virgin olive oil. 
One of my favourite \"vegetables\", though it\'s so uncommon in restaurants here. This rendition was just lip-smacking - the flower stuffed with melted mozzarella seasoned with black pepper, and served on a dollop of sweet bush tomato and onion ketchup. 
The signature starter at this acclaimed restaurant never fails to satisfy - plush, chewy flatbread served with unsalted butter, extra olive virgin oil, and a squeeze-it-yourself tube of flavoured spread. The one I got was a creamy ricotta blessed with the buttery nuttiness of macadamia.

After a cold appetizer at Joël R, we walked over to Osia to have a Hot Appetizer. This was corn meal crusted Foie Gras on top of daikon and a mix of beetroot, rhubarb and riberry. Look good?

How about some #delish #flatbread from #Osia for a start?\n<br />We recently visited #osiarestaurant in #RWS #rwsentosa and was delighted with the food served. Simple looking and yet so flavourful. \n<br />Osia’s stone hearth flatbreads are free form loaves that are freshly baked upon order directly on the floor of a wood fired oven. The bread has a delightfully crisp crust, and is gorgeously airy and chewy on the inside. You can choose from a variety of toppings, and a number of accompaniments from butter, extra virgin olive oil or one of Osia’s signature “toothpaste” tube dips.\n<br />We choose the mixture of #CurryCoconut and #MacadamiaPesto flavours and both was #yummy. \n<br />Share your #foodreviews to #FoodReviewsSG #FoodReviewsAsia!
A main from our set lunch ($68++/pax) at Osia, Sentosa :) Happy Mother\'s Day guys! ❤️🌤
Creamy and balanced with a beautiful finish of natural sweetness. As a ginger lover, the ginger taste is subtle and making it perfect for rainy day like today.
Yes, plsssssss!!! Simplicity at its best!
Bliss in a glass!
Dig in of course!! Then try each one then make a mental note to exercise double time soon.
This version has all the indulgences in it which was properly prepared which makes me a happy camper. \n<br />I\'m looking for a nice version with a good crab cake version.

The dressing had the right, balance of salty, sweet, sour and fattiness that coated the greens well. The parmesan and dried beef added another dimension  of flavor to the already nice salad. \n<br />Osia, Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore \n<br />#foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #nomnomnom #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #getinmybelly #goodeats #salad #foodporn #food #balsamic #instagram #brunch #foodcoma #foodgram #eater #f52grams #yahoofood #burpple #lefooding #eeeeats #bbcgoodfood #foodart #BestInChamba
Being the bread fiend that I am, that\'s the first thing I ordered to start the meal.  Their version is topped with mixed sesame seeds and some Mediterranean/Middle Eastern spices which had a good and interesting flavor. Dip in the extra virgin olive oil and the whipped butter spread and it\'s even better. \n<br />Resorts World Sentosa, Singapore \n<br />#foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #nomnomnom #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #getinmybelly #goodeats #oliveoil #foodporn #food #bread #instagram #brunch #foodcoma #foodgram #eater #f52grams #yahoofood #burpple #lefooding #eatfamous #bbcgoodfood #foodart #foodstagrammerph

Macadamia pesto and truffle kalamata olive! 😍 #osiarestaurant #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgfood #instasg #resortworldsentosa
The kingfish beautifully seasoned and sliced, and the addition of miso sweet potatoes and hazelnuts giving the dish so much playful textures and crunch.
Very light and fluffy soup with strong taste of prawn.
Panna cotta, mousse and ice cream - good. \n<br />Chocolate soup - excellent.\n<br />Rest - average. \n<br />#throwback #osia #longsundaylunch #dessert  #foodplease #eatout #foodporn #yummy #fatdieme #makanhunt #food #instagood #instafood #instafoodies #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodinc #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #happytummy #foodphotography #foodpics #openricesg #FoodReviewsAsia
