The magical $3/piece prawns (so small plate costs us $12). Lol. Admittedly they were pretty big and the pumpkin sauce complemented them with its slight sweetness. Not bad at all really, enjoyed most of the mains. A decent, cooler alternative to eating at chomp chomp. \n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sghawkerfood #zichar #burpple
However, just a short walk opposite Chomp Chomp is the Serangoon Gardens Way Food Centre that houses an excellent zi char stall. Helmed by the lady boss, Ah Yoke, who cooks all of the dishes all by herself, this is my second time and the food never disappoint. For this trip, we ordered the quintessential zi char dish, Prawn Paste Chicken Wing ($8), that truly defines a good zi char stall from a bad one. It was so wonderfully executed; crispy on the outside and having the umami flavour inside. The prawn paste was also not too pungent, making this dish suitable for everyone.
