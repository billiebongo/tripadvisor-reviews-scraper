You guys should be here for real taste of thai delicacy! Ordered pineapple fried rice.
Tangy, spicy (and a little sweet), this fiery seafood broth was perfect for a cold, rainy afternoon (and sinuses, if you have any!)
So satisfying and bursting with a cacophony of sweet, sour and spicy flavours, i can understand why this neighbourhood Thai restaurant attracts snaking queues everyday. Prices are wallet-friendly and a mere 5min drive away (for me!).
Still missing this amazingly yummy Prawn Cakes ($12) I had hours ago over lunch. Amazing Thai food as usual.
I\'ve never been to Thailand so I really can\'t vouch for authenticity, but Nakhon Kitchen\'s Thai food has got to be the most authentic-tasting one I\'ve ever had. Every dish reveals the complex variety that a proper use of delicate spices can bring to a dish.
Better phad thai rendition then the original. Seems like their standard is sadly starting to drop.
Hot, spicy, sour tom yum soup. Perfect on cold, rainy days!
Authentic thai food on a budget! This bowl of yummy Tom yum soup cost me only $6, with generous servings of seafood! Only if you don\'t mind the long queue! 
Having gained popularity, it is no surprise that it will take you almost 30 minutes to get to the front of the queue during peak hours. Getting a trusty Thai fix to satisfy your craving is a lot easier, now that Nakhon has 3 outlets. The Tom Yum soup (you can choose to have the clear or thick base) here is tangy yet subtly sweet, and will kick your butt with its spiciness. If you need a drink to quell the spiciness, their Thai Iced Tea will do the trick. Most dishes are reasonably priced, with meats ranging from $6-$8 and seafood dishes priced from $10 onwards. Order a plate of rice to go with your dishes so you can mop up all that saucy goodness.
Thick and stuffed with a generous amount of minced prawn. It went well with the thai chili sauce 》4Pcs @ $12
No pineapple rice in a pineapple shell. The slightly curried rice is sweet and nicely accompanied with raisins and pork floss. The rice is fried with cashew nuts, raisins, frozen vegetables, chinese sausages and pineapples. The pork floss goes perfectly with the rice and the overall is not too dry. I would order this again to replace white rice 》$6
This is another favourite with the family. The chicken has a layer of crispiness on the outside, coated with sweet and sour sauce but leaving the meat inside soft and tender 》$6
This is a must-try dish when you visit Nakhon! It is sooooo good that you will see this dish appearing on almost every table. The meat are well marinated and the juices are sealed underneath the pandan leaves. It tasted abit like nonya style + chicken satay 》4Pcs @ $6
Stir-fried kang kong with garlic and chili. I love vegetables that are served with lots of garlics coz it will make the dish smells and taste good. You get to see tiny bits of chili on the dish but they are not spicy at all. It tasted like kang kong with garlic and tasty gravy. Not a bad dish to calm down the spicy madness we had from the tom yum soup 》$6
A Thai meal will never be complete without a tom yum soup. They have 2 different bases - Clear or Thick base. We ordered the thick base tom yum seafood soup. By looking at the picture, we thought that this is just going to be a normal tom yum soup. After taking a sip, everyone started drinking water. It was spicier than what we thought. The soup is really tasty but we couldn\'t endure the spiciness 🔥🔥🔥 Steams are coming out from my ears and we ended up leaving half of the bowl of soup on the table 》$6
Over ordered for 2! Ice milk tea\'s a must-try 👍
Pandan chicken (4 for $6), mango salad ($5), tomyum seafood soup ($6), pineapple fried rice ($6), Thai milk tea ($3), mango sticky rice ($5). There\'s no GST nor svc charge. The food were generally nice as well 😌😌 no complaints!
The title says it all. Definitely the best i\'ve had, despite the long queue. Well, patience do has its virtues
Food was good and was not too flavourful for the tummy. Apart from the long queue, this is really one good place for thai food.
For those who enjoy fiery thai food, this is THE place to go! The level of spiciness is not for thr faint-hearted, but we enjoyed them all. Recommendations: tomyum soup, pandan chicken, pineapple fried rice, green curry | ★★★★★
The level of spicy &amp; sour of the soup is Shiok to the max. No regret\n<br />Damage S$6
The rice is still warm when serve. The mango is sweet. \n<br />Damage S$5
Clear tom yum soup, basil pork, pandan chicken and Thai fish cake. 
A well balance of sourness n spiciness with generous serving of ingredients. Me like!
This is truly a gem of a neighborhood eatery where most people living around the area will turn to for a quick thai fix. Had to queue for 30minutes(which is normal), but it was worth the wait!  Dishes here are priced at around $6-$10.      I like the phad thai(my fav thai dish), green curry, chicken wrapped with pandan leaves and not forgetting, ICED THAI MILK TEA!! Chinhojiak!                         Do come here to satisfy your thai food cravings. 
Deep fried red fish with Thai sauce, stir fried asparagus with mushrooms, Thai mango salad, tom yam seafood clear base soup, stir fried chicken with basil leaves. Awesome Thai food in the midst of the neighbourhood. Sadly the food portions aren\'t very worth of the price. 
Nakhon kitchen with my army peeps! Super love the food here but hate the queue
While it\'s almost certain that the Hougang and Bedok communities are already well-acquainted with this neighborhood favourite, the rest of the city might not. The food is cheap and tasty, and the ambience friendly and relaxing. The Tom Yum Soup (you can choose to have the clear or thick base) here is tangy yet subtly sweet, and will kick your butt with its spiciness. Most dishes are reasonably priced, with meats ranging from $6-$8 and seafood dishes priced from $10 onwards, making for a super affordable and satisfying Thai meal.
#throwback Yesterday\'s dinner at #nakhon. A good spread of authentic Thai food that included Green Chicken Curry, Boneless Chicken Drumstick, Phatthai, Seafood Tomyam Soup &amp; Mango Salad. Total cost $40. ت #sharingtheloveofgoodfood #livetoeat #burpple #thai
What can I say. No longer a best kept secret. Queue can be easily 30mins and above at dinner-time. Great value and taste for the price and food rivals the top thai restaurants. Must try, Tom-Yum Gong, Mince Pork with Basil Leaves
Glorious Thai food to mark the end of IT2 exam!! @liimkaii yay happy happy 🙊🙈😋❤
Thai food lovers who have never tried Nakhon is missing out a lot! We love their Tom Yum Soup with generous portion of seafood and it\'s flavor is just great! 
At one of my fav Thai restaurant with the CIA girls! @lsuyi @sugarcreame Minced pork with Thai basil. Most of the dishes here are really spicy but its so good we just carry on eating. Like a beautiful torture 😆
It\'s really flavorful with perfect grainy rice.. the seasoning of this plate is perfect.. the beef is sadly just for show but all is forgiven when the lime is sqeeze and also.. the arrival of the fried egg.😌\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#nakhon#kovan#thai#foodie#friedrice#delicious#makan#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#hawker#localfood#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#like4like#foodporn#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
#aroi #thaifood\n<br />不用多說了吧？我最愛的泰國餐館，沒有開玩笑，真的是從小吃到大😂 昨天見老朋友LT，聊得太開心，聊到忘記付錢就離開餐館了。😷幸好走不遠，LT拿出錢包，突然想起我們兩個還沒付錢。馬上趕回去，边走邊我們倆邊自嘲自己也太丟臉了，怎麼沒人攔住我們呢😂 哈哈，回去付錢時還裝沒事，他們好像也沒發現我們剛離開過。哇，之後驚魂未定，花了一陣子才平復。
No, actually, we ate this when the weather was insanely hot. 😒 thanks for coming by @Cheltton, y u always late. HAHA
This is as close as the ones I had in Thailand! Salty, sour and spicy! Flavour is heavy and intense! Texture is soft with a slight juicy crunch ! Might get gelak if you have too much so do control yourself! 😛\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#nakhon#kovan#thai#foodie#eat#delicious#makan#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#hawker#localfood#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#like4like#foodporn#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Usually this version of fried chicken tends to get \'gelak\' cause of the oil! As for theirs, it was ok.. It wasn\'t too oily and the seasoning was just right! As their food tends to be heavier on the taste, this one is no different. Now Gimmie another plate of rice already! Yum! 😋\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#nakhon#kovan#thai#foodie#eat#delicious#makan#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#hawker#localfood#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#like4like#foodporn#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
This is slightly to the salty side, but still great!
Sweet, sour spicy.. All 3 flavors infused to form a nice bowl of aromatic tonic! Only one word to describe it \'HEAVEN\'
Basil Beef Rice ($6) is the choice!!

So here\'s a #latergram of some, shall we say, overrated thai food - fried calamari and pandan leaf chicken. (Aroydee @aroydeethaifood is way better). The only win-factor is the lovely blue china.
So so good tom yum! It\'s a 10/10! 
Mango salad, a party in your mouth
I MISS BKK ALREADY
We love both equally! Perfect for those cold, rainy days. #BurppleTastemaker Geraldine Tay recommends the Tom Yum soup at Nakhon Kitchen. #burpple
Perfect spiciness and extremely delicious papaya salad!
Love the food here. Value for money and addictive!
