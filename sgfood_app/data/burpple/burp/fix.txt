The choux pastry, with whom I first made acquaintanceship 47 weeks ago, is undeniably the Beyonc√© of the trio and stands puffy with pride having the most followers and admirers. Elsewhere, the chocolate cake is lusciously thick and so rich it holds excess coins on its head, whilst the chiffon cake is swooning to the left from all the birthday excitement. Keep up the good sweet treats, FIX! #HappyBirthdayFIX
Have a fix-tastically brillant 1st Birthday #fixcafesg! #happybirthdayfix! \n<br />Cute doddles from @gigglesandjiggles,  hope she wins! üòä
We went on a weekday afternoon, thus there were not many people, which enhanced the relaxed atmosphere there. My friend and I again relied on Google Maps and it was another day of hilarity and chaos. We made a wrong turn, whined and sung under the sweltering heat of the midday sun, and basically felt like tourists in our own tiny island. Again.  
The fish &amp; chip is goood!! served on a small plate though. The salted egg dip with doughuts made it perfect. #fixsg #burpple
Bus to Ah Hood Road: 139, 139M
Brioche bread was too dry and crunch, and the lobsters popcorn just doesn\'t justify. That handcut potato chips are too thick. Totally a NO NO dish to order #foodie #foodstagram #burpple #bukapuasa #instafood
Made with a variety of cheeses, FIX\'s 3-Cheese Penne Gratin is a dish cheese-lovers will thoroughly enjoy. However, the light-speed waiting time for the dish to be served was a liiiiittle too quick - making me wonder if it was pre-made, frozen and re-heated. The dish would\'ve definitely had that extra WOW-factor had it been oven baked on the spot. That said, FIX is definitely a cafe worth visiting. 
This rendition was rather disappointing; waffles were dry and bland, with fried chicken nuggets which were really mediocre. Strange that even the mayo was pretty tasteless, and the only flavour that actually tasted of something was the maple syrup. Guess there is really a lot they need to do about this ...
The dip was rather watery and did not taste much like salted egg. The donuts were just ordinary plain sugared donuts too. Nothing fascinating and I wouldn\'t pay $6 for it again.
The cheese was nothing special and the beef had this odd tinge of sourness. And oh ya where\'s the chilli? üòí
Qiuuing.wordpress.com] on FIX Grill! The great thing about dining at the new extension is that you can order food items from both FIX and FIX Grill! So we got to enjoy the famed donut with salted egg dip.
The hidden butterscotch centre in the choux pastry is a delight! By the way, I just learnt the correct pronunciation of \"choux\" (shoo) yesterday.
The last of which is glaringly missing. \n<br />Staff was apologetic and took the dish back to the kitchen. My dish returned with chocolate sand haphazardly scattered over, which made me thankful that I took this picture before I returned the dessert. Fortunately, their main courses here are still impressive. \n<br />By the way, enjoy 20% off your meal till 30 April 2015 as part of their opening special!
I liked the pineapple salsa and slightly caramelised sweet potatoes which came with a bit of salt, but the tuna would be more enjoyable if it was hot.
My chicken wings with Sriracha mayonnaise ($6.90) didn\'t disappoint. In fact, I think the price is really reasonable for three whole wings! This is only available for dinner on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from the outdoor grill. However, I\'m not loving the ambiance this time around. With three birthday parties it can get a bit rowdy.
We had a hard time trying to decide which dessert to get and in the end settled for the butterscotch arabica choux and it totally exceeded our expectations. Instead of cream inside the choux puff pastry, the coffee flavored cream was outside. What comes out unexpectedly from the puff was luscious butterscotch (almost tasted like salted caramel!) and chocolate that goes so well together. Absolutely sinful! 
We were very happy with our finger lickin\' good soy chicken Drumlets. The slight sweetness from the soy marinade together with the crisp of the deep fried chicken Drumlets was the perfect comfort food for Sunday brunch. 
While checking reviews on FIX, the Naanwiches were a hit and we agree! Just love the colors of this dish, so bright and cheery, as with the whole retro vibe of FIX cafe. The chicken tikka with runny poached eggs on a naan came together quite well and was a nice change from the usual eggs Ben for brunch. Two thumbs up! üëçüëç
Pan-seared salmon on wild rice and romesco sauce. A healthier option!
Started with appetizer from FIX. Beef Chilli Cheese Fries ($8), which is really yummy. Would have preferred more chilli though.
From FIX Grill situated within FIX cafe. A white chocolate mousse infused with bergamot orange served with mixed berry Coulis, lemon verbena oil and chocolate sand. Surprisingly the mousse was light in flavour; perhaps the bergamot orange helped neutralized the sweetness of the mousse this leaving it only with the fragrance of milk chocolate. Mixed berry Coulis and lemon verbena oil added a different dimension of flavour by incorporating a tart flavour to the dessert.
From FIX Grill situated in FIX cafe. Half chicken brined and slow roasted, with Porcini Cream Sauce and Saut√©ed Kale. Chicken was really tender even for the chicken breast, and had light savoury flavours. Not a fan of the Porcini Cream Sauce, which seemed a tad thick and overly creamy while the saut√©ed Kale was decent while warm; eat it before it turns cold. Comes with a side of chips (not in photo) that is hand cut and fried in-house which were crisp yet not too greasy; so addictive that I finished it despite this being my friend\'s order.
From FIX Grill situated inside FIX cafe. The Wild Rice was pretty interesting for their texture and their more earthy taste, but it went well with the slight spicy and tangy Romesco sauce and the well-seasoned Salmon which not only boasts of salt, but is also really fresh as the signature flavours of the fish was really flavourful here. Would not mind ordering this again!
Soy chicken wings which tasted SO GOOD. I promise it\'s better then 4fingers or ikea chicken wings! Had the beef with kimchi naanwich which tasted okay but not WOWfactor. Donuts with salted egg yolk was good, remember to consume it while it\'s hot! 
Instead, we refocused our attention to enjoying some good ol\' meal-time conversation made complete with grilled yums. \n<br />Conclusion: #fixgrillsg serves up a yummy meal, and what better proof than empty plates and happy diners? :)
Opened by the guys behind Grub, Fix and Grub Noodle Bar, the new restaurant at HomeTeamNS-JOM Balestier serves a variety of grilled skewers and delicious mains. I am honoured to be photographing their food before the launch and also had a taste of some of the items.
Vegetarian Primavera Pasta - Featuring tagliatelle with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, arugula, mushroom and feta, this rustic dish has a cleaner taste yet equally yummy when toassed with a flavorful pesto cream and fresh tomatoes.
Back here again for more naanwich goodness üëç gotta love the nachos they give free with every naanwich ordered. Also just had to order the crispy soy drumlets again, too guuuud. 
Not the best taken photo but I\'m here for the words so. Ambience factor here is tops, even though it\'s situated at home team ns. The open area makes lighting good and an easy breeze flows through. Food is affordable and not bad, if I do say so myself. We had the chicken tikka naanwich, white lotus tart (thing, forgot the name), and salted egg yolk doughnuts. The naan and the achar together was quite the interesting sweet and sour combination, and the runny egg yolk added some texture and flavour to it all. Loved the doughnuts but hey who doesn\'t love everything liu sha. The white lotus mousse was light, and it was a good complement to introduce the much stronger green tea filling inside. Crust was firm and solid, and I liked that cause it gave some texture to the otherwise uncharacteristically soft mousse and brought out the flavour. I liked this place and would come back again! ‚ò∫
Just look at that. That Naanwich is really a must try, can you believe how good the food is? It taste just as good as it does in the photo, trust me! We got the main set which consists of the Naanwich of your choice, together with nachos and a drink. That costs us $13. And the sides were pretty affordable, the beef chilly cheese fries are $6.50 and the donuts with salted egg dip at $6.00! So good you won\'t believe it! 
FIX has focused on putting an approachable spin on familiar home-style desserts using quality ingredients. My favourite is the refreshing Passionfruit, Mango &amp; Coconut Chiffon Cake. Butterscotch Arabica Choux is an instant hit among dessert lovers. Coffee-steeped Chantilly cream give this unique dessert a smooth finish, with a surprise treat of sticky vanilla caramel within. Other popular items include a fragrant Strawberry Pistachio Rose Tart and rich Cacao Barry Chocolate Truffle Cake. 
Had the beef and kimchi naanwich with some wings and the balance between acidity of the kimchi and richness of the beef was just perfect. Wings were also crisp and had me finger licking right till the last wing :\') Glad that there are finally halal caf√©s popping up in the sg scene! :-)
Although FIX is known for their naanwiches and Donuts with Salted Egg Dip ($6), it would be a shame if you missed out on their stellar desserts and Crispy Soy Chicken Drumlets ($7). These drumlets are the perfect combination of salty, spicy and crispy ‚Äî a must-order item! To sate your sweet tooth, go for the Butterscotch Arabica Choux ($6) ‚Äî a crumbly, light choux pastry filled with salted butterscotch and topped with coffee cream. For something light, their Passionfruit, Mango and Coconut Chiffon Cake ($7) is a sure win. \n<br />*Halal-certified
Not really as good as it looks. Overrated. Still think that the salted egg should be injected into the doughnut.
‚Ä¢ Naanwiches ($11): It\'s was okay for a main course but serving is quite small! Served with nachos chips! ‚Ä¢ Donuts with Liu Sha Dip ($7): Just okay. The Liu Sha sauce was more towards the sticky side and not much of the taste of salted egg. ‚Ä¢ Churros ($8): Served with dark chocolate sauce that is too watery and Churros is coated with a thick sugar batter. ‚Ä¢ 3 Cheese Penne Gratin ($10): Your usual Mac \'n\' cheese. ‚Ä¢ Salted Caramel Chocolate Tart ($7/8?): rich taste of chocolate and on you bite it, the taste of salted caramel will please your taste buds! 
Come here for the Naanwich; Fix cafe\'s signature menu. I had the turkey ham and cheese naan- I find the idea of having the naanwich dish is the attraction factor for fix cafe üòä. Try the chicken tikka or the turkey ham and melted cheese naanwich. A cafe with a very simple concept and you\'ll enjoy eating by the pool.!
The naanwich was yummy! The most raved reviews were their salted egg donuts which i\'ve managed to try. I would say that it was overrated as i could not really taste the salted egg. Their drumlets was yum too! Overall it is located in a calm and relax place by the poolside and the price was reasonable.But brace yourself for the mosquitos!
Give the cakes a try, you can omit the food :p
Beautiful presentation, lusciously indulgent, but a tad overloaded with caramel. Great if you have an insatiable thirst for all things sweet though!
Once again, smutennis ventures forth
Perfect after a morning of tennis under the blazing sun
Never too late to celebrate Christmas here at fix. A solid vanilla tart crust with dark chocolate ganache, crunchy pecan brittle and salted caramel. Just the right amount of salty to balance out the sweet.
Their signature items include Chicken Tikka Naanwich and Beef &amp; Kimchi Naanwich.¬†Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/dbs-spark/
Read too many posts about FIX cafe and it lead me on a journey down to Ah Hood Road to try out the Chicken Tikka Naanwich. Succulent chicken pieces, tangy achar, salad leaves and a poached egg on top of a toasted naan makes a great lunch meal! 
Fix for a rainy day. 
The mains wasn\'t very fantastically done but I kinda love the black sesame smoothie. Have yet to try their desserts, which I heard was better. Will be heading back for the desserts next.
The choux itself tastes like the new born child of a cake and cookie, with a Mars Bar caramel-esque filling and the most aromatic coffee cream. 4.25/5
Liu sha donuts, chicken tikka naanwich with poached egg, three-cheese penne gratin.
Sounds like an overly sweet dessert but it\'s actually not! The butterscotch is well balanced by the dark chocolate and the coffee mascarpone. It\'s like having tiramisu on top of a butterscotch choux! It\'s probably easier to eat if you pick up the whole thing and bite!
Although the naanwiches look small, it\'s actually quite a good portion tgt with some dessert! I had the beef and kimchi naanwich which was pretty good! The beef was really tender! Although the egg did not flow, it was soft but at the same time sturdy? You could actually pick up some and spread over the naan. No idea how they did that. But it was good!
Of course, I will turn it into an #instavideo And it\'s quite funny &amp; spontaneous! Ë∞¢Ë∞¢ÊîØÊåÅ!
Thumbs up for the really creative naanwich! The coffee was pretty good and they have a wide variety of awesome bottled drinks. A pity most of the food here is microwaved so don\'t expect much!
The vibe is just right. Affordable and delicious food, coffee tastes good. 
Time seemed to zoom past so quickly this morning.‚Ä¢ [STRAWBERRY PISTACHIO &amp; ROSE TART S$6] - fresh strawberries, raspberry coulis, rose cream chantilly, pistachio financier, butter shortbread. Perfect treat for gloomy Mondays!
Last night\'s dinner: Chicken Tikka Naanwich (naan + sandwich) x Mushroom and Feta Naanwich x side of nachos or salad x Butterscotch milkshake\n<br />Good food with good company = happy me! üòÅ\n<br />#burpple
The chicken tika naanwich comes with a cup of nachos. The servings might look small but it\'s just nice for one person. It\'s very popular cos the chicken is not spicy. 
well okay, that\'s only cos I\'m a huge HUGE cheese fan (I don\'t even like any form of pasta!) the people behind @grubsingapore have done it again with @fixsg! amazing food at an obscure location. perfect place to get some grub fix on a Sunday. don\'t say I didn\'t share! hurhur @igsg #igsg #fixsg #foodpornasia #setheats #burpple
Here we go again! My my, how can I resist u? #fixsg
Naanwiches seemed more like a gimmick, sorta disappointed by the soggy naan though the toppings were tasty! Crispy wings were fantastic though! A MUST-ORDER | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
They sell Mexican inspired dishes such as chips (with salsa &amp; nacho cheese sauce), Naan Sandwiches &amp; drinks. Everything was under $30 
His favourite‚ù§Ô∏è‚Ä¢ [70% DARK CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE SLICE S$7] - dark chocolate mousse, sacher cake, dark chocolate curd, dark chocolate glaze, chocolate &amp; sea sable cookies
The highly raved donuts w salted egg dip was lacking imo. Nannwich w kimchi &amp; beef were rather good but overall nothing impressive though. üôâ
Donut with salted egg dip ($7): donuts tasted pretty much like those which you could easily get from bakeries/four leaves. The salted egg wasn\'t rich enough in flavor, it wasn\'t salty enough neither sweet as well. I envision the taste of the fillings of Liu sha bao but it was far from that.... $7 for 6 donuts was a rip off IMHO. Go for the cakes instead, the cacao Barry truffle chocolate cake ($7) was everything I love, the mousse to cake ratio was perfect (I dislike cakes that\'s entirely made up of mousse even if it\'s chocolate). The cake was rich yet not cloyingly sweet üëçüëå butterscotch arabica choux ($6): puff pastry filled with chocolate ganache and butterscotch sauce and topped with coffee cream. Photogenic and great tasting at the same time üëèüëè 
$7. Pretty good. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside! Slightly sweet with hint of spiciness. The squeezed lemon gave it a good tangy taste. Loved that it was still crunchy despite leaving it untouched for quite awhile.
This cheesy mess is a good kind of mess. Bonus: there\'s mushrooms.
Had to try the salted egg dip donut (which was not as good as I expected, sadly bland to me and G asked if I got the lemon custard instead? but the donuts were soft and flufffffy and not too sweet). Chicken tikka naanwich - the naan was a little tough. The crispy soy chicken was really good though!
Not Chinese pau but the angmoh donuts with salty egg custard dip. Piping hot and fluffyüòã
This place has been making its rounds on social media, but I find it to be nothing more than just hype. The naanwich was an interesting concept, but turned out to be nothing more than extra chewy pizza. Perhaps the desserts will fare better, if there is a second visit.
Generous filling with pretty poach egg..Naan was abit tough but still taste good..Friendly service crews..
Brunch.. What can I say...Awesome.. Runny and creamy omelette..Thick turkey ham with saut√©ed mushroom..Brioche..
Wasn\'t very impressed, the dip should have a heavier taste imo
Finally went to this place after seeing all the reviews, sad to say I missed out on the cakes :( in picture: turkey and cheese naan, donuts with powdered sugar and salted egg dip, complementary nachos and latte
Cheddar nacho comes complementary!
Mmmmmm.... Too good to talk about it. Dig in!
There\'s something for all taste buds and seriously, all the desserts here are good ‚Äì they\'re made by the people behind the acclaimed Windowsill Pies, so I\'m not surprised. My personal favourite is the Passionfruit, Mango &amp; Coconut Chiffon Cake, so light, refreshing and incredibly light that it had me diving back in again and again and again. \n<br />Chocolate fanatics can OD on the Cacao Barry Chocolate Truffle Cake, which is insanely Rich (emphasis on capitalised R); those who like surprises will adore the Butterscotch Arabica Choux, a crusty pastry with a core of comforting butterscotch and chocolate, topped with coffee cream; the Strawberry Pistachio Rose Tart is just so unique and well-balanced with each of the three components blatantly present in flavour; the Twice-baked Sourcream Cheesecake is a nice compromise between the rich New York bakes and cotton-light Japanese variety. 
Hot and crispy at serving with a touch of tangerine. Good starter but not a wow dish
Love the colourful presentation. Beef was soft and flavorful, went well with the kimchi. Naan was hard to cut. Nachos were nice.
Lemon tart transformed into a smooth beverage ‚Äì what sorcery is this?! I endorse!! 
Such a clever use of salted egg in a dessert! These one-bite sugared donuts are fun and not too messy to eat, though the dunking sauce could have used a tad more salted egg to amp up the savoury factor. 
Need to find out what\'s in the batter cos it\'s so damn good ‚Äì peppery and salty and spicy in every crunchy bite, with moist, tender flesh beneath. Definitely one of the must-orders here! 
Pretty good value for $10 ‚Äì the creamy, cheesy tube pasta is baked with chicken and mushrooms so it makes a pretty filling main for one or a nice side for two or three to share. 
The kind of comfort food you get cravings for just about every week. The achar could do with more pickling, but the smoky chunks of tender chicken, moistened with a runny egg, are so moreish with a fluffy pad of flatbread. It comes with nachos ‚Äì really just for those who need a little extra something to feel full, and washes down beautifully with a lip-smacking lemon curd milkshake. 
I love thick, substantial quiches like this one, but the milkshake quite stole the show for me with its rich, fragrant caramel-y flavour enhanced with toasty, fibrous dessicated coconut. 
the need to learn to make this sauce. \n<br />on another note, the week is still not done yet. üòê
Hearty, casual food by the poolside at this newish al fresco concept by the people behind Cookyn Inc and Grub. Muslim friends will be happy to note that the cafe is in the process of getting their Halal certification. 
Only 2,000 steps, a fitbit-equipped friend shared.
Loved the sour cream cheese layer and the subtlety of the citrus glaze.  Not sure about the busy looking paper base though.
Would love t try the lemon curd dip as well but got rejected when we asked for both. Pretty double standard service cos i saw someone mentioned tt they gave her both when she asked. ):
Choux was pretty good but would\'ve preferred it w lesser caramel, was a tad too sweet. üòÇ
New cafe #FIXsg, overlooking the pool at HomeTeamNS-JOM, marriage sister GRUB cafe sensibilities (milkshakes, coffee + cakes) with some interesting bites that\'s been given a local twist - and at very reasonable prices (~$14 for main &amp; drink).\n<br />PS. Head down on weekdays to beat the crowd!
a new cafe brings light to new dishes. salted egg yolk fans rejoice. this new variation: donuts with salted egg yolk.  who wants? come come don\'t be shy.
strawberry pistachio rose tart. a tad dry. but overall very good. I am still yet to try the double baked cheese cake
what a stunner of a milkshake. initially was hesitant when @dawnmusk wanted it but now I\'m won over!! really worth a try! on another note there\'s @gellybeann at the far end. long time no see fren.
and it did not go down well. missing our order of de milkshake.  the smoked turkey ham and cheese naanwich was üôå 2 hands. it was served cold, the dough was far too thick which caused a problem when trying to dissect de whole naanwich. the ingredients were good though. generous portion of turkey ham. if it was served thinner and warmer, I\'m sure it would be a foodie delight üòã
The crackling puff of the Butterscotch Arabica Choux caught me by surprise. I love this dessert. The overly milky coffee on the hand could do some improvement.
Coconut coconut! I love everything coconut and got drawn by the passion fruit mango coconut chiffon cake. Though I love tarts too, but I went for this instead. Would have preferred the coconut taste to be stronger though. You could taste the coconut on it\'s own but it got drowned out by the taste of mango and passion fruit, or rather mostly mango. All in all, it was a light and refreshing cake! Ordered this cake with the ice mocha since they have a cake + drink set for $10(+ $1 for ice). I like that they didn\'t add sugar and I could taste the pure choc &amp; coffee ^^ Ordered a black sesame brittle milkshake as well. My bro LOVED it, he couldn\'t stop drinking it. This drink was definitely black sesameish enough! But one gripe is I only got to taste the brittle at the end and it was a small measly chunk.. If they were going to include brittle in it\'s name, they should have put in more chunks..
The ambience of Fix is pretty cool, but unfortunately there\'s no aircon here. Ordered their donuts that come with two dips: lemon curd and salted egg yolk custard. Pretty easy choice to make, huh? Donuts were light and fluffy, reminiscent of those punched out of regular donuts from old school bakeries. The dip could afford to be a little stronger in taste, but at $6 this dish is a steal.

FIX, a brand new cafe opened by the people behind GRUB, brings you the naanwich. These signature naan/sandwich fusions come with a variety of fillings like chicken tikka, smoked turkey ham &amp; cheese, and even beef &amp; kimchi, all nicely wrapped in soft naan and served with a side of cheesy nachos. Be sure to try their range of desserts, which are all made in-house. Located at HomeTeamNS @ Balestier, you\'ll even get to enjoy good food with a poolside view. Not too shabby.
Tucked away in the Balestier neighbourhood in the HomeTeamNS club, FIX has one of the most relaxing views for any cafe as it is situated directly beside the club\'s swimming pool as an open-air concept. While its not the only mains served, the signature mains have to be the Naanwiches; a fusion of Naan and Sandwich that fuses both Indian flavours with other cuisines such as Korean (Beef &amp; Kimchi) or Western (Smoked Turkey Ham &amp; Cheese). Don\'t forget their desserts which are all made in-house, and are an interesting mix of flavours that would tantalize the tastebuds. Lastly, go for a cup of black coffee, which uses Mocha blends which have a sweet chocolatey note at the end which is pretty unique; just avoid the Latte that is pretty overpowered by milk.
Naanwiches are FIX\'s specialties, and they offer a variety of four with various fusion flavours and even one vegetarian option too! Safest bet would be the Chicken Tikka, soft Naan bread encasing well-marinated Chicken Tikka pieces with a mildly spicy sauce that fires up the dish with each bite. Crunchy cucumbers and red/green peppers add to the refreshing taste, as well as making it taste more authentic as well. Served with Nacho Chips on the side; corn chips with a rather thick cheese sauce and salsa atop.
This was a brilliant mix of bittersweet goodness. Pretty Choux pastry that\'s crumbly outside but light inside, filled with a layer of coffee cream made from Arabica beans; lightly aromatic. Stuffed in the Choux pastry was sticky salted butterscotch; just without being too sweet, and also chocolate ganache to further enhance the flavour. Perfect dessert to pair up with a cup of coffee!
Special order as they don\'t have Flat White on the menu. They claimed that they are using a \"Mocha\" blend by a local roaster, which has a chocolatey and sweet finish. It\'s a wee bit too milky, so avoid ordering the Latte as the milkiness of the Latte is overpowering. Alternatively, you can also ask for a double shot for your coffee for a stronger flavour profile
An unhurried #monday #morning of heart-to-heart conversation with a precious #friend. We are made to know and be known. Risky, but it is worth it. *Venue - 31 Ah Hood Road.

But tonight, we were proven wrong. \n<br />Led here by #burpple , I feel so stupid for making the hubs drive me all the way here. Looks can be so deceiving and we had a hard time finishing our food. \n<br />Utterly disappointed with my supposed bowl of dessert which tasted bland. To tops, it came with a burned taste and a cup of defeated-tasting and looking chocolate (urgh). I thought the fries could be its saving grace. But the overpriced plate of fries which cost us $8 + gst just make me felt like I was just chewing carbs and salt, lotsa salt. #wastemytime #wastemycalories #badmusictoo #misguided

Titled as the cafe with one of the most photogenic dishes, it\'s not hard to see why! This is their salted caramel Choux pastry. Their Mac and cheese and naanwiches are also worth a shot.
The salted egg yolk dip made them taste even better. Get your fix here if you need a different genre of brunch food.

Very disappointing service.
Quite a good deal and it\'s pretty good!

Sadly, I was quite disappointed with the dip as it wasn\'t what I expected the salted egg to taste like (in my opinion‚úåÔ∏è).
Freshly fried donuts with salted egg yolk dip from FIX. How good can this be? Addictive and simply awesome, just like a good liu sha bao :) #food #foodies #foodie #fixcafe #fixcafesg #singapore #singaporefood #cafehopping #cafesingapore #springtomorrow #sgfoodies #sgfood #delicious #tasty #yumyum #yum #happy #brunch #lunch #eat #hungry #instafood #foodstagram #sgig

üòÅ Have a good weekend people!
Nice combination but the chiffon could do better..
FIX has focused on putting an approachable spin on familiar home-style desserts using quality ingredients. Try their refreshing Passionfruit, Mango &amp; Coconut Chiffon Cake. 
A common complaint amongst the diners but hey, at least it\'s photogenic üòè and the prices are nett! üòäüòäüòä

Fix set = main + drinks + mini nachos.
I like it. üòã
Too layer: passionfruit, mango cubes embedded in a coconut gelee (I think). Tart body of mango and passionfruit mousse.  Quite the crowd pleaser.

A rather messy meal however considering the decent food at such an affordable price, it\'s worth the mess

The kimchi and beef naan was alright, kimchi can\'t go that wrong! But I liked the smoked ham and cheese naan more, boring choice but it wasn\'t salty and the runny egg compensated the lack of sauce which tends to overpower any taste. The donuts were soft and fragrant, but the liu sha wasn\'t strong enough. Very rude staff at the counter on a Sunday afternoon, ruined the experience. 
Mini Donuts with Salted Yolk Custard! Yummy! \n<br />#burpple #minidonuts #saltedyolkcustard #hipstercafe #fixsg #hiddencafe #cafesg
