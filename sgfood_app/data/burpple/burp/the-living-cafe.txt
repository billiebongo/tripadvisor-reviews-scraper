Hey girls, craving for a juicy burger but afraid of the calories? Try this holly goodness! Details @ http://missneverfull.com/?p=3363
A really healthy yet delicious pizza topped with a generous amount of mushrooms, alfalfa, pesto sauce and a touch of fragrant truffle oil. Yolk in sunny side up was runny enough, and the sunny side up had little oil in it. The dough was surprisingly good too even without cheese or much butter. Sharing between 2 people is just right. $19 for such a filling and healthy treat may be costly but definitely worth it once in a while! 
Huge appreciation for bringing more REAL healthy and wholesome food to Singapore! Refreshing and nutritious with a great range to choose from! 
What I can say is.. Interesting. 
Loved the stuffing! Grated carrots and some other things...
Filling and healthy!

Last night\'s dinner at The Living Cafe,Balanced Living.Hormone free sous vide chix with my baby.Perfect ambience;chilled cafe del mar on air,dimmed lights and the delactable Raw chocolate Ganache Tart for dessert.Yes.I said it,delectable Raw Chocolate Ganache Tart.
Personally I feel their standards have dropped, especially their desserts. #rawfood #sgfood
There is no better place to detox than here. Focusing more on raw vegan cuisine, do not expect goumet dishes but rather more basic ones made with super fresh and natural premium ingredients. Order their TLC Cheese Burger which always hits the spot for many meat-eaters. Finish off your meal with the super refreshing Raw Key Lime Pie made from avocado and zucchini. If you would like to bring some of these goodness home, they also sell health products and conduct multiple educational classes on how to live life the \'raw-er\' way!
For all health conscious cafe hoppers, here\'s a cafe for all health food. vegetarian options widely available. Check this peaceful cafe out!
