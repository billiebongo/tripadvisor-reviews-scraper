Juicy, yes; crispy, yes, and spicy, yes that, too - and a very heavy-handed dose of it too. I loved it though, being a lover of spicy food, and I loved the tenderness of the meat. I was on fire after eating a number of these appetite-whetting wings.

Huge. And that\'s my only comment.
\'250g for $19 - ish. The beef wasn\'t perfect though. \'
