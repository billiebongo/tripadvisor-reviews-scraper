Legendary pancake listed here. A must for groups. Fluffy warm pancake base, hand deco by the very friendly staffs, very cosy place with aircon. The ice water is self serve.
A plate of macaroni soaked with baked chicken, celery and carrot in soupy cream sauce. Toasted garlic bread dipping it. Comfort food.
Take a break, have a cup of tea, coffee. \n<br />Thank God for another day, be it good or bad.
Toasted ciabatta, black pepper beef slices, greens and tomato. Also basket! Cool ambience. People watching too. 
Cold brew coffee that is really expensive. Wanted to try it so I bought it from d\'Good Cafe. I really liked it very much although it is on the pricier side. There was a little bitter aftertaste and it wasn\'t very sweet as well. Would be recommended that you chill the drink first before actually drinking, would taste much better than if it were to be drank at room temperature. Particularly love the lingering taste of the coffee beans.
Very very hard and dry waffles. Disappointing. Would not try the waffles again I guess you should just stick with the pancakes even though there may a really long waiting time. The strawberry sauce given wasn\'t enough for the whole waffles and it definitely was a challenge for me to finish the waffles because of the dryness of it. The only good thing was that the waffles wasn\'t as filling as others from other cafes.
d\'Good Cafe allows you to customize your orders for the pastas which is literally amazing because it puts you in control of what you want rather than it be dictated by the cafe. First, you have to select the base the the noodle type, which I selected linguine. Lastly, it was about whether you want additional toppings. This dish is amazing because the linguine was cooked well, not too hard and not too soft. The spices enhanced the flavour and the prawns were big. Simply wonderful past!
Came to this place during my birthday and only if you go on the exact day, there will be a free jumbo upsize to a 3 liter drink. I suggest that you share it with many people. I shared it with 7 other people. Way too much and sinful. The cafe was rather hot so I suggest wearing clothes that are not too thick and nice. 
It was pretty worth it considering the ambience. Do climb up to the 3rd level if you can!!! The chill vibes really does it. The eggs Ben was pretty average; hollandaise sauce being pretty bland and Bacon tasting processed. But it was 13.90 w/o gst so I guess it\'s quite alright! The carbonara goes for 15 and bangers and mash for 12. Not the best of food, but still alright!!!\n<br />But do definitely the cafe au lait! They serve double shots -de facto- so it\'ll give you a caffeine boost early in the morning!
With wholemeal spaghetti , together with its rich flavored tomato based seafood , a hot and delicious brunch that you can awaited when you are at the d\'Good cafe. Not stingy with the their slightly large prawns, for those smaller mouth , the prawn will require you to bite a few times. The whole dish might be a bit oily for some due to their generous mixing of olive oil when they cooked.
Good combi of Egg Bens with the bacon! ($13++) Sat at the outdoor area &amp; it was so nice to chill! Will definitely go back for their Lava cake one dah 
One of the best Pasta I\'ve eaten! If you are a lover of cream-based pasta, you gonna love this to the moon and back! Pan-seared sea prawns which is so succulent compliments well with the fresh and juicy button mushroom! Portion is generous enough for the price of it and I think it\'s so worth! Definitely going to go back again. 
alright this tasted more like a bland omelette I guess I\'m just not a fan of Dutch pancakes but fortunately the generous (and delicious) toppings made up for it! duck was really tender and the fruits added a nice citrusy touch to the otherwise really really really bland dish :-) this leaves you feeling really light bc it doesn\'t have much oil hehe healthy? maybe 
The coffee is not so strong and the bottle is quite cool.
Great taste of coffee latte. And the small cookies are nice.
D\'Good Cafe doesn\'t serve any ordinary pancakes, Fluffy Deutsh Skillet Pancakes (Dutch Baby Pancakes) has a light, omelette-like texture. Grand Marnier Sweet Potato Pancake ($12). Mashed sweet potato with azuki crushed pistachio,matcha grand marnier sauce and vanilla icecream. A perfect combination, you can also taste bits of azuki beans with each bite. Eat it while its hot! üòãüëçüèª
Goood yummy way to eat a pancake! Savory sweet style pancakes with a tangy dash. Healthy flavor of vegetables. Abit on the pricey side though. But with all the serving style, being in a heavy hot pan, imagine doing all that post-dinner scrubbing, it is kinda justifiable. Yumz. Worth the calories. 
Initially ordered the matcha pancake but they were out of sweet potato. Got this instead. Surprisingly good. Imagine bitter-sweet thick lava oozing out from the cake which each of the first scoops. Paired with chocolate drizzled across the plate. Matcha lava cake can\'t get any better than this. Delicious bit of dessert. Share the food, share the calories!
Plain simple and good pancakes. If you don\'t like the thick fluffy pancakes, try this! If you like something like thin crust crispy pizza as compared to regular pizza, try this! Simple with cream cheese and maple syrup. Add a twist with the lemon. Go easy on the sides to save some calories. 
Sweet, acidic, salty, savoury are tastes I would used to describe this dish. Pomegranate Citrus Smoked Duck Pancakes ($13) is definitely a must try when you\'re here in D\'Good Cafe! üëçüèª Omelette-like Deutsh Skillet Pancakes, smoked duck slices, mandarin orange, pear, pomegranate, greens, caramelised cinnamon walnuts and citrus sauce. This dish will take your take your tastebuds for a wild ride! üòã
It was a pancake kinda day at D\'Good Cafe! Black Pepper Beef Pancakes ($12) was pretty tasty. Sweet Deutsh Skillet Pancake, with savoury black pepper beef slices, topped with poached egg, sundried tomatoes and truffle oil. Love the part when you break the egg and coat this dish with its yolk. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Wanted to order the regular skillet pancake, but they wouldn\'t let me change the cream cheese to something else, and since I was lactose intolerant I was put on the spot and had to make another decision. Ended up ordering this, and I felt I would have enjoyed the normal one more. But it probably won\'t be something I crave? 
Fresh sea prawns tossed with chilli padi, lots of garlic and white wine „Äã$16
A platter of toasted brioche, baked tomato with basil, English baked beans, saut√©ed mushrooms, bacon, English cumberland sausage and scrambled eggs „Äã$16.50
Portion is abundance with affordable price range. Will drop by another time to try out different dishes! 
8/8 Toast [$13.50] and Carbonara [$15]. Their carbonara is probably the best (and only decent) pasta I\'ve had there so far. The generous servings of bacon + creamy taste is definitely a thing for me. The 8/8 toast was really interesting with a poached egg being wrapped by an omelette. The omelette wasn\'t something to scream for but the taste as a whole (eggs, ham, tomatoes and greens) was really well balanced and would definitely be a great way to start my day.
The Dutch Baby Pancake (which originated in Germany!) Is the latest food trend in SG. \n<br />Here, a fluffy skillet pancake, with a texture like omelette but sweeter, is stacked with moist &amp; savoury smoked duck, zesty mandarin orange, crunchy lettuce, pomegranate seeds, and caramelised walnuts!
Marvel at the skill needed to have a perfect runny poached egg, wrapped in an omelette! With cheese, sundried tomatoes, fresh lettuce, ham, on a thick brioche, mornings should be like this!
Cannot take photo for too long because we have to eat it piping hot!!!! Hot and crispy pancake served with thick and rich sweet potato puree and matcha sauce. All these top with vanilla ice cream. That combination of hot and cold, sweet and savoury! üòç It was so worth the 1 hour wait!! 
besides dessert, they serve main dishes as well. really beautiful place.
One of d\'Good Cafe\'s popular Deutsch skillet pancakes with pistachio, azuki beans, matcha dressing, a generous amount of mashed sweet potato and vanilla ice cream ($12). It\'s a rather unique and flavorful combination but I thought the sweet potato was a bit overwhelming sometimes - maybe because I didn\'t have it immediately when it was hot :x Also had the maple sea salt latte which was delicious! 
Visited one of my old haunts for the wifi and the study space on the third floor. Tried the Deutsche Skillet Pancake ($12) and wasn\'t that impressed üòï didn\'t find the pancake as fluffy as described by online reviews and the lettuces thrown on top of the salad made the presentation of the dish lacklustre. Also tried their brewed coffee using the yellow bourbon coffee beans ($6). Would go there again only for the coffee and ambience.
Read as egg upon egg. Love the eggs! But I personally find that there isn\'t enough sauce/dressing to go along with the toast. 
How can one not smile when your hot chocolate comes with a cute little bear. Love the ambience of the Cafe, but probably it\'s better to visit at non-peak hours to enjoy a good chit-chat session with your friends 
Linguine Alle Vongole ($17) was perfect! White wine not too heavy &amp; linguine not too oily. Small clams were sufficient &amp; they also had some pacific clams which I liked. Garlic &amp; sundried tomatoes also give this dish a good kick. I definitely want to order this again!
Mushroom Cream Pasta ($14) was too dry, I think it\'s the cream sauce. Better off ordering other pasta here which are more worth your tastebuds!
I\'ve always wanted to try this cafe, and today I did. It left me very satisfied although it was a little too spicy for me. The Tom Yum flavour was very rich, and if you love spicy food this one would be great for you! I especially loved the iced chocolate. It was thick and I think I tasted a tinge of Milo in it! I loved the ambience of the place too. 
Decided to make good use of my trip to holland village for physio every week by trying out the food in this area.
Pasta was a tad too creamy for me, though i must admit the portion is pretty generous. Had it with a cup of mocha frappe which was pretty mediocre. (would prefer the one at Starbucks unfortunately) A for Ambience though!
Why not try the Deutsch Skillet Pancake? I had the privilege to try their Sweet Potato Pancake with Azuki and Vanilla Ice cream [$12]. Best taken when it\'s hot. So don\'t take picture for too long okay? üòÇ
First and only to create this awesome blend of goodness. The cheesecake is unlike those heavy creamy cheesecake you have outside, it\'s light and the sea salt taste is prominent in every bite. Can\'t say no right? If you\'re there do try it. üòã
Deutsch Skillet Pancake with sweet potato, azuki &amp; vanilla ice cream ($12). So pretty n instagrammable. And yes, I eat with my eyes first. Judge me if you are not üòõüòôüòù
Topped with sundried tomato, poached egg and truffle oil. If you like the aroma of truffle oil, this doesn\'t fail you. Even rabbit is running away with it üòù \n<br />Check out the new menu that was launched on National day. \n<br />Thank you for hosting us @dgoodcafe.
This eggy and buttery pancake accompany w/ fresh lemon juice, maple syrup &amp; cream cheese. \n<br />It can be eaten as breakfast, dessert or any meal.  #burpple #dgoodcafe

Review: This is not a very good choice of aglio olio in this cafe. The whole plate of spaghetti is totally tasteless even though the prawn is very fresh.  #eatandbrunch #burpple #dgoodcafe

Coffee Sesh with TheSilverChef where I tried his custom blend coffee brewed from washed Yirgacheffe beans.
Who doesn\'t love a good, hearty English breakfast? The brioche was buttery and incredibly light, and the scrambled eggs were cooked just right - not too watery nor rubbery. The saut√©ed mushrooms were a little too wet for my liking, and the sausage and bacon were nothing special (not crispy). For $16.50, I would say that it is quite substantial and would definitely fill you up. The ambience of the place is really nice, located in a quiet corner of Holland Village. Wouldn\'t mind popping back for a coffee.
Way overpriced and tasteless. Also not very clean tables and filled with secondary school and JC kids seat hogging. The standard of this place has really dropped.
$5.50 for regular cappuccino ; $6.50 for regular Caramel Cream. Great ambience, lots of great insta-friendly corner. 
Quite a delicious dessert and worth it for a reasonable price! Wasn\'t super flowy or liquid-y, center was more like a gooey paste, but yummy enough esp with the interesting matcha taste :) 
Generous portion of mushrooms. Sauce was quite simple, tomato based, nothing too special but still a comforting and tasty dish especially if u like mushrooms üçÑ 
Enjoyed this dish! 2 of my favourites- pesto and prawn, as well as my favourite kind of spaghetti- linguine. Generous portion, pesto was tasty and not too rich, plus prawns were very fresh üëç

d\'Good Cafe @dgoodcafe is definitely one of my top choices. \n<br />Full review up on my blog (link in profile) \n<br />Over here is their yummy Purple Sweet Potato Waffles, feels like lovely cross between waffles and cakes batter yet crisp on the outsides. A hearty dessert.
Light on the palate, with a delicate balance of sea salt and maple syrup. Savory meets sweet in this signature dish that doesn\'t disappoint from @dgoodcafe #cake #dessert #cheesecake #dgoodcafe #cafe #sgcafe #burpple
A unique twist to normal waffles but I didn\'t quite like it..
They actually forget my order and I waited for quite awhile for this. Tbh the latte art is quite ugly too. ._. Where\'s my cute üê∞

Salt is about making things more delicious, it wakes up flavors, creates balance and gives desserts that little edge that makes you want to indulge in one more bite// That being said, my finicky sweet tooth so has the hots for this {üçÅM A P L E sea salt Cheesecake} @dgoodcafe - a healthy golden crust cradling smooth sweet savoury luscious fillings. This gets me speechless, everytime...
Thai inspired dish, the chicken thigh is marinated with lemongrass before it is baked to perfection. The sides r good as well, what a lovely hearty dish to have üòçüòçüòç
d\'Good caf√© is located at holland village. I would say they have decent variety of food and drink. Before going to the cafe, I came across many reviews about their Fresh Sea Prawn(not frozen) Aglio Olio and wanted to give a try. However, their all-day breakfast caught my attention. \n<br />I ordered their Ham and Cheese French Toast ($9). The toasts are filled with honey baked ham, cheese and French berry jam. It is also served with fresh fruits on the side.\n<br />My friend ordered Bangers and Mash ($12). It is served with Grilled Cumberland and Smoked Chicken Sausages on a bed of soft mash potato. Finishing it off with caramelized onions. \n<br />They are also famous for their latte art but I was sited outdoor that day and it was scorching hot so I ordered their Mocha Frapp√©($6.50).  \n<br />This is definitely not going to be my last visit as I have yet to try their Fresh Sea Prawn Aglio Olio. 
Carbonara with oyster instead of bacon .. Oyster is fresh... And the egg is flowing 
D\'good Cafe should be a cafe that needs no introduction in the cafe hopping scene. Having been established in 2012, way before the cafe trend ever started, this cafe has already been churning out good desserts and drinks, using good quality coffee beans and allowing customers to customize their own coffee
After two weeks down with flu virus, I\'m back to my \'basic\' diet.\n<br />Featuring my favorite Eggs Bendict bunch.
The coffees are good. Food are normal. The English breakfast is like the norm for this cafe. But the cafe is really great place to catch up with friends.
A three-layered cake made up of oreo, cheese and chocolate. You can\'t go wrong with this combination, and it\'s delightfully sinful. 
I had my reservations about how this dish would fare, cos my previous experiences with lemongrass chicken were really so-so: they usually turn out very dry, and/or with an overpowering lemongrass taste. Thankfully, this turned out to be pretty well executed. I liked the sides as well: the shimeiji mushrooms were tasty, and the homemade mashed potato had firm cubes of potato embedded within. Caution: don\'t order this if you\'re already starving, cos it takes the kitchen 30 minutes to serve this. 
A winner in both presentation and taste, this dish is enough reason for me to return again. The menu emphasized that they don\'t use frozen prawns, which explains why they tasted so fresh and succulent. The linguine is slimmer than usual, which is great cos I love thinner noodles! But the most addictive thing about this pasta is perhaps the tomato sauce, being tangy, spicy, and sweet all at once. Really good! 
Sea salt kissed maple cheesecake a big favorite from d\'Good Cafe, sweet and savoury with a whiff of maple syrup with each bite. 
For those hankering to know what are the best recommendations in Singapore, check out the food guide for SG top 50 favorite Western and Asian restaurants available at all major bookstores. Have a beary good week ahead!
The prawns weren\'t that fresh but the pasta was good!
Wish it had more of the fragrance of lavender. But not bad!
Good friends are a treasure. I\'m glad I have both.
One of the best coffees I\'ve drank. \n<br />This cafe was awarded RAS Epicurean Best Cafe Award 2014.
Tender chunks of steak that had a strong Rosemary taste. Quite delish when paired together with the slight hint of cheese and pastry. 
Quite spicy, full of garlic. Love the al dente pasta, very well done with lots of olive oil. Prawns are supposedly not frozen, and indeed were quite supple. $16 nett.
Good for drinks. Carbonara wasn\'t bad. Skip the eggs benedict; the yolk was hard and there was barely any hollandaise sauce.
The pizza is thin crust but it looks like those biscuits!, we can feel the melted mozzarella cheese in our mouth and the rich flavour of the portobello and the sweetness from the tomatoes sauce. 
Had the Chicken &amp; Mushroom and Steak &amp; Cheese pies. Solid ingredients and crust did well to complement them. Hot mocha was okay.
The cake is good. Like the textual and taste. Macchiato is on the sour note. Overall is good. :)
Forgot to top ice cream coz was frighten by their lift almost trap inside üòÅüòú
Different from the normal ham n cheese sandwich. Besides the main stuff...blueberry jam is added
Latte ($5) or add on $3 with breakfast set! To me the latte is too butter and slightly to acidic. Yet the cookies/biscuit served is great! The environment is cozy. I sat at the swing area. It is a good place to chill and relax !
egg Benedict\'s served with salad ($13.50) the thick toast is special and comes with a sweet taste. #egg Benedict is awesome. Filling and delicious. A great brunch I have!
Matcha latt√© &amp; homemade english breakfast! Portion was generous in my opinion. However, space is limited even thou they\'ve 2 lvls, so crowded! 
üçµ This Green Tea Cream Frappe is good as the matcha taste is not too overpowering unlike some other places.
In need of some matcha goodness! üòÑ
Strawberry banana with vanilla bean ice cream and maple syrup üòã - was less ten $10!
The richness in this cup is mind blowing. I could get use to drinking this every minute of my life. The folks over at d\'Good Cafe are warm and friendly too.
$20 Lunch Set Meal each. Masala Chicken üçõ // Cappuccino ‚òïÔ∏è // Mushroom Soup üç≤
The Portobello Mushroom Pasta was quite heavy and creamy for me. I felt very full even just had half plate of it only. The Cafe Latte was nice!
A bit of everything on the plate!
Look at my cute monkey art!
The chocolate is just nice for me , if reduce a bit sweeten will be good. Te caramel still not bad.  
The eggs benedict was delicious, so was the raspberry iced tea, ordered myself a mushroom soup as well, and the total bill was about $24 Sgd, sat at the swing and it was fun and relaxing, 
I\'m sure d\'Good Cafe is pretty serious about its coffee since it even ages its own beans, but something else interests me more - the latte art! Pardon me and my frivolity, but the barristers here make some of the cutest latte art. Look at that totoro - who can resist?? There are many cafes with impressive latte art, some even 3D, but what impresses me is that the baristas here pour the art. Like the circles that make up the soot ball, totoro, totoro\'s belly and the hearts. Don\'t know about you, but I\'m awestruck. Other designs I\'ve had include the teddy bear and cat. üòç d\'Good is a really nice place to chill. It has free wifi, abundant power points, and a nice conducive area (with cushions! Haha) on the 2nd floor that is frequently occupied by people reading or using their laptops. The mains and desserts are only average, so I\'d recommend just getting a nice beverage to sip on :)
lousy service, it took them like 10 minutes to serve the hot choco, and half an hour more to get my food ready. the food itself were bland, my hollandaise sauce was tasteless, definitely the worst sauce that i\'ve ever had. the only good thing is the hot choco, the rest were so bad it ruins my weekend
The maple sea salt cheesecake (bottom right) is just heavenly. It\'s just full of melt-in-your-mouth goodness with a hint of saltiness that complements the fragrant maple flavour. I really like it as it isn\'t too sweet!:)
The hot chocolate is very cute! They could make any kind of animal character like bear and cat! The cheese cake is not bad. Price for hot chocolate is around $4 and the cake is about $6.5 
If you\'re a big fan of really creamy carbonara, you\'ll love this but it\'s too creamy for me and the Portobello mushrooms didn\'t really feel worth it. Love the deco though! I think they make changes to their interior design every now and then, great place to chill with friends!
I guess this is 1 of the better hot chocolate around. Made by melted chocolate n not chocolate powder. The cafe art made my day better. :)
Changed the baked beans for my sides to sauteed mushrooms. The musky taste is quite prominent, the bacon is \"oishii\". Overall,this is the good stuff.
Awesome poached eggs. But the bread they use turn soggy after a while.
üò™ Sigh. I miss #yahavakoffee and #axilcoffeeroaster very much after two consecutive days of not-so-good coffee.
Tried the chicken and mushroom pie, and the pasta my friend got. Didn\'t manage to try the other two in the picture. Flavors were not bad, but not especially good. The cafe is a pretty good place to go with a group of friends, and they do put in a lot of effort into presentation. Won\'t be going back anytime soon though.
On the top right, green tea frappe. Top left, mushroom soup. Bottom right portobello pasta and bottom left chicken pie! :-) this meal was quite value for money, pretty filling plus the atmosphere was very cosy! I ordered the pasta and it was seasoned really nicely with a dash of garlic! :-) There isn\'t service charge for this cafe so if you\'re looking for a valued for money meal, this is worth trying! :-) however, the range of food is quite limited :(
Loved the eggs. They were runny enough and well complemented by the hollandaise sauce. The bread was really soft too!  
The dish consist of scrambled egg, bacon, mushroom, tomatoe with 2 slice of bread with butter or jam. Price worth it. Delicious and satifying 
Love this maple one! www.ms-skinnyfat.com #brunch #sgfood #sgcafes
Crispy bread and flowly egg - splendid all-day breakfast!
The staff did mention that it will not taste the same without prawns. However, I found the chicken tasted better than the pasta. It needed more salt and spice. A tad too plain tasting for an aglio olio.
A huge cup, always accompanied with a cute bear. The baristas do take pride in their work. They did the first cup and it wasn\'t satisfactory and they did a perfect one.
8 prawns in it!!! Not bad but the pasta itself seemed a tad overcooked to me
Light with fragrant crispy biscuit base, not overly sweet! Despite finishing a plate of pasta I could still down the entire cheesecake so.. Yep pretty good! üòã
What sets D\'Good Cafe apart from the rest is that they offer customers a unique experience of creating their own coffee blend from a range of single origin beans. Their coffee art also never fails to amaze -- imagine an adorable bear or rabbit sitting in your coffee! Don\'t hesitate to order their affordable tea-time sets, available after 2pm.
A must try dish for brunch &amp; not just the aroma of tea attracts me,one first sip got me havin to hve more sips..awesome.
I can never get sick of this area. Can you? However, I don\'t really like their pie. It\'s too dry 
Chocolate Cheesecake. But wait! This grizzly teddy says his favourite cake is this one with a thick layer of ultra-dense, creamy chocolate on top! Which would you rather have - chocolate cheesecake or salted caramel cheesecake?? #cheesecake #chocolate #cake #teddy #dessert #sweet #foodporn #sgfood #flashbackfriday
Baked Chicken Alfredo. Last week at the #Burpple meet-up - linguine  in thick cream sauce with a generous serving of unfortunately dry chicken. \n<br />#pasta #linguine #alfredo #chicken #sgfood #foodporn
Fresh Prawn Aglio Olio &amp; Caramel Cream Frappe. #100happydays \n<br />14. Love being part of the Burpple community. Great catching up with the Burpple team as always! Nicely decorated cafe, although the ordering area could do with some reorganisation. The Aglio Olio is a safe dish to order. #burpple
This maple sea salt cheesecake is the star dessert here at d\'good! Really unique taste but my vote still goes to the good ol\' oreo cheesecake at the back! But that\'s definitely something worth coming back for! üôÜ
$13.50 eggs Benny. Decent and affordable. Had an awesome time with burpplers! Eggs were runny enough But it wasn\'t good enough to make an impression 
Thanks to #burpple I discovered a new cafe in #hollandvillage that does a tasty #aglioolio #pasta made with fresh prawns and have giant #teddybears to keep you company while you dine. Nicely done #dgoodcafe
Burpple meet-up, with cakes on the house! :) #burpple #teddy #bears #cake #dessert
#BestMeetUpEver for 2014 with Team Burpple, and New Foodie Friends.
Meatballs were huge. Taste and flavor were just alright. 
My expectations were raised when I read in the menu that they use fresh sea prawns, and not the frozen sort. I\'m pleased to say that my expectations were met. The prawns were indeed fresh (you can taste the difference!) and quite large as well. Thoughtfully shelled so only the tail was left, the prawns were arranged in a ring around the mound of linguine that was perfectly al dente and redolent with garlic and chilli. Highly-recommended.
The powerhouse dessert of the evening! d\'Good Signature Maple Sea Salt Cheesecake, that always get sold out easily.
Signature cheesecakes on the house! Thank you d\'Good Cafe for the warm hospitality! Even teddies love the desserts!
First #BURPPLE Eat out for 2014!
I\'m quite a sucker for (good) carbonara. Honest verdict? This can fight those from Pastamania üòû
Sitting on the rooftop, having a cup of latte. Life\'s goooood :).\n<br />The coffee aroma is very strong and the taste is a bit bitter, just perfect! \n<br />#Latte #Coffee
I had to wait so long for this Sea salt maple cheesecake, but it was totally worth it!  | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
And not to forget my √ºber cute bear-bear hot chocolate!
Up close of my peach tart. It was a bit too sweet for me.
Yesterday\'s \"dinner\" after a very long day at school with @afen14 and @moimou. So late that they only had desserts left. Moroccan mint tea, chocolate cake, earl lavender tea, hot chocolate, carrot cake and peach tart. To hitting more caf√©s this year!
Great vibe and decoration. Not forgetting the cool lift which left me the deepest impression. Second visit, will love to visit here again. Most prob during the non-peak hour. 
Pictures of d\'Good Cafe not taken very well but hope it\'s useful to people interested! :) very near hollandV train station! 
It\'s not too bad for a cheesecake luver like me. Giving out 3 out 5 stars for this cake and green tea cream. 
The ice cream melted sooooo quickly, very disappointed because I\'ve heard many good reviews on it. Still wondering if I\'ll return for their other stuff!
The eggs benedict was delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also savored the mocha frappe to my heart\'s content. I honestly thought it was better than other frappes out there. In short, D\'Good cafe is a must go!!
Another cafe at holland village with 2 different decors on 2 floors.
Eggs Benedict is really good. It goes well with a cafe latte :)
One of my fav places to spend time alone reading, journalling and talking to God whilst enjoying the best coffee in the west (and Holland Village!)
So what if some people took away the rights that you are entitled to have and yet... you can\'t openly start a fight? Sometimes a step back is just not enough... I guess I need to probably walk back the opposite direction. Just need a moment of peace tonight. Drink a cuppa &amp; just enjoy the cold night. It\'s funny how the coffee art is a Side-Love. Side love...
The portion was just nice for 1 and it tastes yummmm. 16$
What I really like about this cafe is that the baristas are really friendly and most willing to customize your drink the way you want it. The Eggs Benedict ($13.5) was just perfection during my first visit but the standard dropped during my subsequent patronage. There\'s also a nice swing there where people love to take pictures of themselves. So go ahead and let loose! 
Feeling at home with a cafe having a rooftop and an indoor swing.
#throwback Egg Benedict at D\'Good cafe at Holland V!
I love Egg Benedict üòçüç≥ Reasonable pricing too. $13.50 + $3 for my latte
Was told to be homemade by the boss of the place. Service can be better i think. Overall is a cozy place.
For lunch. What can I say. Breakfast is the most important part of the day. So two breakfasts is necessary. What\'s more, it\'s an English one. Love the huge portion!
Cafe latte~ YUMMM :) hahahaha! Love the hearts :) #cafelatte #cafe #delicious with @astrophes
Tea break with @ennieeee at d\'good cafe! Like the bear! Looks really good! Check out this place at Holland v!
Not exactly hidden, but you would walk by without noticing this if you weren\'t specially looking for it. And you certainly wouldn\'t expect this little haven from the looks outside (they occupy Level 2 &amp; 3). Beautiful little touches and thoughtful details sprinkled everywhere. 10% discount for senior citizens 60 years old and above, so go on bring your folks ;)

Ugly cup of coffee. Not fantastic in my opinion. Service was shitty and the food was terrible. 
When I\'m in love with you, it\'s hard to forget the virgin experience of my first cup of single origin in my life. This is the most fondest moment that I had for coffee. And this is where i start! 
Eggs and Ben Breakfast! üç≥ First cafe-hop of the day, while waiting for @qiuuing üòã
My wholesome English Breakfast for dinner! üòã Toasted brioche, üçû baked tomato with basil, üçÖ English baked beans, üå∞ saut√©ed mushrooms, üçÑ back bacon, üê∑ English Cumberland sausage, üêñ and scramble eggs! üê£üç≥
Who says you can\'t have breakfast for dinner? üòã
Vion\'s pasta order for Bacon Carbonara üçù Simple but nice!
Jocelyn\'s simple order of Scramble Eggs üê£ and Toast (S$7.50) üçû as she wasn\'t that hungry!
Chicken and mushroom pie. Not bad! Portion was rather small though
This is a classic cheesecake that you see it flooding at every bakery and caf√©s. But how it taste like, it\'s something I can\'t explain with words. It takes more than a thousand words to describe this slice of cheesecake. 
Love the crumbly biscuit crust, the sweet apples and the thin layer of pancake that absorbed all the flavours üëçüëçüëç .\n<br />.\n<br />#jayellesays #sgeats #burrple #burrplesg #instafoodie #setheats #fatdieme #sgfoodie #sgfood #delish #dessert #sweettooth #sugarrush #applecrumble #almosttgif #worththecalories #dgoodcafe
I like the ambient very much. You should drop by and see it for yourself. Staff are friendly as well. The coffee is not pricey and it\'s extremely good.

IS IT ATAS TASTEBUDS?
Ordered the pancake Apple crumble. It is sweet and tasty. Cost $12. Filled with Apple crumble. I really like it a lot. The texture of the pancake is soft too. Yummy ! My friend ordered housemade English breakfast. Cost $16.50\n<br />It looks yummy and smells good too. She ordered the Cold Brew and I ordered the Chamomile tea. Total bill cost $44.95 with gst. This cafe have a outdoor seating on the 3rd floor. 2nd floor have a two seat designed as a swing facing the window. But the spaces are limited. The ambience is nice. Thumbs up!

üî∏üî∏\n<br />Oven baked warm and fluffy goodness. A whiff of the scent of butter permeates in the air. The tangyness of the mangoes unfolded on my palate. A dainty slathering of the vanilla ice cream on the cushiony pancake. A delectable amalgamation of soft, airy, citrussy and sweet textures waltzing festively in the mouth.\n<br />üîºüîº\n<br />This to me was a yummy flirtatious pancake which is suitable for anytime of the day. Available till 31st Dec.
I couldn\'t taste the freshness of the prawns which was what most people raved about. What I liked was that the pasta was served hot‚ô® and the sauce was really creamy.üòã The price was tad pricey but good that there is no service charge. The filter coffee was interesting but I don\'t see people drinking coffee? #pesto #pasta #lunch #hollandvillage #cafe #burpplesg #burpple #tasty
My coffee moments.
Wouldn\'t it be nice if everyday is a pizza day? ü§î
Rose lemon tea with honey. Reduced honey to cut down the sweetness. Light, smooth with a tinge of acidity. This tea is good for detox. Latte is a single shot of espresso and without sugar.

üî∏üî∏\n<br />Relatively new on the menu. Yoghurt berries pancake. The skillet pancake does not disappoint . We actually love it for its light and airy texture. The yoghurt with its tangy tones was a delight and topped with berries coulis, we went like \"omg\"!! It is good:)\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Yes... I am happy so far with my bday moments.

My ever dependable barista friend... bless his heart, poured a heartilicious art even tho there were neverending orders to fulfil. üîπüîπ\n<br />Heartwarming on a cold rainy day. The morale of the story : it does not take alot of time or energy to show appreciation for the things, small or big, that people do for you. Action speaks louder than words.
Ok... whats that got to do with my pasta?? Not totally the pasta but the people.\n<br />üîπüî∏\n<br />I am a regular at this cafe. Well cos it is conveniently in town. I can chill, do my work and have my coffee. Also, I get to spend \"quality time\" with my busy busy good friend at the cafe even tho we dont talk but the presence was felt.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />Anyway, I was away from Sgp for over a week. When I popped in, Gary was the first to say....\"welcome back\" then followed by a few more of the staff. It put many smiles on my face. It felt warm. üîπüî∏\n<br />Today I went back again to satisfy a hungry craving but had to wait at least 20mins for it. So Gary @dgoodcafesg... bless his kind heart... came with this bowl of prawn aglio and said please have this first while waiting. Sweet!! üî∏üîπ\n<br />Thank you Gary for the complimentary delish aglio!! It staved off my hunger moments.  Much appreciated. It is staff like you and the rest makes regular customers keep going back there.
Coupled with news like how far a friend came thru sheer hard work is always music to my ears. The most awesome thing was witnessing two beautiful rainbows and that to me was a special sign that there is a \"pot of gold\" at the end of the rainbow.... at least for this good friend of mine.
taste the espresso\n<br />2nd sip ... taste the buttery, malt and honey\n<br />3rd sip ... chocolaty, mellow, sweet and full bodied.\n<br />This is \"Dirty\" which is the name of the coffee.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />My good friend &amp; barista surprised me with a truly \"wake me up\" cuppa. Shockingly strong robust mojo which I needed on a sleepy afternoon. My kinda cuppa with the wonderful smooth and mellow finish.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Thanks ahh @barista_rdhelz for always being able to predict my coffee moods.
üîπüîπ\n<br />Always a \"moment\" watching the latteartist passionately putting heart and soul into his trade.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />Thank you @barista_rdhelz for sharing your coffeelicious moments.
It was a slightly longer wait for my cuppa. But it was worth it. The coffee was very welcoming especially on this cold rainy day. In the midst of many orders in waiting, he took his time to pour this gorgeous latteart.  The others which he poured for the customers was the rosettas or the hearts. ‚óæ‚óΩ‚óæ\n<br />First time I have seen this design from him. This one was truly meaningfully special. Salamat @barista_rdhelz for expressing your friendship thru your art.\n<br />#coffeetime #coffeegram #coffeenart #thingsaboutcoffee #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafollow #pinoybaristasg #friendship #dgoodcafesg
D\'good cafe has launched a series of mind blowing tea mocktails. \n<br />Those looking for the sparkling blue pea flowers drink, you can get it there as well.
‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Is this the new black? The color in itself says it is bitter and strong. A first sip awakens the palate. Further sips revealed a little acidity, smooth and silky with a slight hint of the coconut. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Some might find this is not their \"cup of coffee\". For me, I enjoy strong and bitter with a slippery feel down the aesophagus.
‚óΩ‚óæ\n<br />There was a cooling effect coming from the mist. Weightless, delicate and a gentle cloud like feel that tamed the dark and robust espresso.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Oh gosh... did I just say that? What was most important was how the brew will taste which will be in a later post. \n<br />#coffeetime #coffeegram #coffeenart #thingsaboutcoffee #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafollow #singaporeinsiders #discoversg #chopesg #citynomads #cafesg #cafehopping #pinoybaristasg
@barista_rdhelz explaining to @i_post_for_love the dynamics of this coconut cold brew.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Coconut water infused into the espresso. So what is that grey looking cubes sitting in the glass? Well .. it is called \"whiskey stones\". They are cubes of soapstone that will chill your drink without diluting it. Unlike ice, whiskey stones are non-porous, odorless and tasteless. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Commonly used to chill whiskey, Barista Rudel used it to chill this cold brew. The cubes chill the brew without affecting the taste. Coffee was strong with a hint of coconut and a smooth finish. Amazing but true!
A pancake with a scoop of ice cream shared by 4. Pancake super light and fluffy with a fragrant comforting aroma.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />We thoroughly loved and enjoyed this very simple sweettreat coupled with good strong coffee and wonderful conversation. Thank you for an awesome afternoon as always. Looking forward to the next. @rain498 @tiara_star @i_post_for_love\n<br />Thank you @barista_rdhelz for being so warm and hospitable.
‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />So pleasantly surprised.... along came 2 glasses of freshly just brewed oolong tea then followed by 2 glasses iced tea latte, compliments of the two tea sommeliers. ‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Tea so clear, weightless and fragrant with a tinge of floral. Iced tea latte not too creamy with a teeny smokyness.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />We liked it. Thank you, tea sommeliers .. sorry not to have remembered your names.. @dgoodcafesg for the complimentary drinks.
And we were like.. oh no.. looked like the omelette we had for lunch.\n<br />üîº\n<br />Not the usual nice round flat pancakes. This was a rugged round pancake with a soft and light texture similar to an omelette. Topped with roughly chopped pistachio nuts and drizzled with grand marnier sauce. A huge dollop of purple sweet potato which we liked very much.  A huge dollop of vanilla ice cream in a separate cup by the side.\n<br />üîº\n<br />We were scratching our heads... huh?? Are we suppose to eat this on its own or throw it on the pancake? Then it hit me... pancake was hot. If the ice cream was served together it will melt fast and pancake will end up being soggy. Logical? So we waited for it to cool alittle before putting it all together. Not too sweet, nice crunch from the nuts and the dissolved grand marnier gave that gentle hint of acidity and citrussy. Yes yes... we had a good time demolishing our dessert. Yummy too!! #pancakes #dessertlovers #teabreak #hungrygowhere #burpplemessyeats #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #8dayseat #sgig #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #instafollow #eatbooksg #singaporeinsiders #dgoodcafesg #cafesg
It is cold. It is coconutty. It is coffee.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Dry ice is poured into the flask and created a what I termed as a \"Romantic Brew\". ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Full of surprises @barista_rdhelz and honored to be almost always the first to taste your new creations.

Very brit looking lamp...similar to those that can be found along the cobbled streets in London except this is mini size.\n<br />‚óæ\n<br />Lamps aside. I had alot to drink today namely specialty tea which i will post later; the earlier post of chocolate surprise and now latte. My barista friend, as usual and as always, prepared a new blend (different from what I used to drink in their Holl V outlet) which was so well suited for my \"hard to please\" palate.\n<br />‚óæ\n<br />Roasty, nutty and full bodied.... not a single tinge of acidity. Yay.... it satisfied my caffeine fix! Noticed the cup and saucer?? Quite pretty right? I was told that it was custom made here on our shores... yes... support the local entrepreneurs!!\n<br />‚óæ\n<br />When I entered the cafe, wah....immediately felt the hospitality. Was ushered to sit at the bar counter where all the action was. It was cool watching my fave barista doing what he does best and the tea sommelier brewing the teas in a somewhat graceful manner. Thank you @barista_rdhelz for the latte and always checking up that everything was fine with me at the bar.
Boasting of a huge space with an exciting new food menu but yet maintaining favorites from their Holland V original menu. ‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />A new item named \"Chocolate Surprise\" concocted by Chief Barista @barista_rdhelz . Am the first to try it. So chocolaty and not too sweet. The hot chocolate being drenched over the dark chocolate exposing a hidden surprise. Curious?? Visit D\'Good and find out what it is.\n<br />‚óΩ‚óæ\n<br />Finally a cafe right in the heart of town with an extensive list (and I mean a booklet) of good coffee/mocktails/specialty teas etc. Oh... not forgetting a Tea Sommelier onsite. A cafe to chill, do your work or rest your weary feet after retail therapy.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Thank you, Jasmin @dgoodcafe for the intro and being my handmodel; Rudel for the sweet surprises and Mr. Chew  @chewchormeng for the chitchat. It was nice meeting you.

we ordered 3 main courses, 1 dessert n 2 drinks for 3 ppl. the portobello eggs benedict was no bad considering the rich flavour of the mushroom n the pasta which was some prawn aglio olio that was recommended by the staff was great (it\'s cooked with white wine) n they r very generous with the prawns (they gave 6 prawns for the pasta alone) n the fried rice was underrated but it\'s the best among the 3 items, it\'s not like normal fried rice n it\'s really a must try, the cheesecake was normal but the iced chocolate is good ‚òïÔ∏è

Cold black coffee to chill the hot afternoon. Relax.
Got this with the weekday set menu. This was definitely one of the most bitter cappuccino that I have ever tasted and the latte art did not look as good as those from other cafes. This one looks very dark and dull. Really disappointed with the cappuccino here, I suggest buying the d Good Cafe Unknown which is way much better than the regular drinks in my opinion.

Enjoying the Vongole Pasta at @dgoodcafe and their new grapefruit tea drink while clearing work. \n<br />A sublime yet classic pasta dish so well executed. Each strand of pasta coated with the juicy broth of fresh clams, tomatoes, chilli and white wine. And look at the generous serving of clams! \n<br />And the üçπ now my new favourite at the cafe, loving the citrusy flavours from the grapefruit puree used in the tea. \n<br />Camera: @nikonsg Nikon J4, Nikkor 1 lens \n<br />#dgoodcafe #hollandvillage #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodies #whati8today #vongole #pasta #cafe #supportlocal #burpple #sgeats

Makes for great Thursday lunch entertainment fodder hehe \n<br />Everyone just needs to chill. The thing is ... And seriously, the thing is - if u r good at what you do, and you have the masses appreciating your works, you can stand up to any criticism levelled at you :) If not, just work harder at your craft until you attain perfection, which is never btw hehe. So it means you just have to work even harder at the one good thing you have been gifted with.
Bits of mandarin oranges provided the slight acidity and the sweet crunch from the pomegranates. Surprisingly the combi works.

I\'ll return for their coffee, and pray that there aren\'t so many students around creating a ruckus. STUDY THEN STUDY QUIETLY CAN? HAHAHAHA!
|| Sometimes {Classic} is good; especially in this case where you get a good ole\' fluffy Dutch pancake enlivened with a simple squeeze of lemon and a teensie slathering of cream cheese. Maple syrup? Yes, pleaseÔºÅ
It has the flavour of waffle, texture of multiple delicious soft-chewy crepe stacked together, and lingering caramel flavour from the Maillard reaction during the pan fry. The sides of the pancake is nice and slightly crispy, making each bite truly enjoyable (and so much to experience). However, I find the mashed sweet potato too gao, and it makes the entire dish too jerlat. I only managed to finish a quarter of the ball of mash sweet potato and I almost died of food boredom. Would recommend them to use sweet potato ice-cream instead. It will make this dish a much more interesting in both taste and texture. #sgcafe #sweetpotato #pancake #skillet #dgoodcafe #dgoodcafemenu #dessert #review #sgcafehop #sgfood #instafood #foodlover #review #reviewig #pancake #foodlover #instafood #foodporn #hollandvillage #singapore #cafe #cafeculture #openricesg #burpple #nomnomsg

Actually it\'s {Maple Sea Salt Latte}, any of which floats your boat really„ÄÇ
Probably the only cafe that serves these babies in town now. \n<br />My favourite has got to be this Classic version served with maple, cream cheese and lemon juice. Only at $8, what are you waiting for? \n<br />Savory option? Go for their Rocket Bacon that comes with sundries &amp; cherry tomatoes, crispy bacon and parmesan cheese. \n<br />#Dutchbaby #pancakes #newmenu #dgood #dgoodcafe #deutsch #skilletpancake

Love this but bread was too soft 
We ordered portobello mushrooms with eggs benedict, cafe latte and earl lavender latte. The eggs with mushrooms were really good! We also took an egg yolk cutting video to amuse ourselves wahahaha
Narrowed down to the Lava chocolate cake [$5]. The richness of the chocolate was good and it wasn\'t too sweet. Could have been better if they had heated the cake up for a longer time. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafoodsg #instafoodie #igsg #eatoutsg #setheats #burpple #openricesg #lavacake #dgoodcafe
Their prawn aglio olio [$16] really lived up to the hype with a generous serving of crunchy, flavorful prawns tossed with garlic and chili. The egg benedict [$13.50] and cafe mocha [$5.80] was also good. Overall, a cafe worth exploring especially the decor at the alfresco area but it can get packed really fast despite occupying 2 levels. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafoodsg #instadaily #igsg #eatoutsg #burpple #openricesg #tinlicious #8dayseat #coffeeart #brunch

I have to admit this is among the best mocha I had before. Besties &amp;  I were all impressed by it! Only thing I don\'t really like here is the serving crew seems to be shorthanded and at times they can give the \"you have to wait hor!\" impression. But nevertheless very good coffee &amp;  already worth making a trip here. \n<br />#breakfast #brunch #cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife #cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeegram #coffeeholic #coffeelife #coffeelove #coffeelover #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #lunch #sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #sgcafefood #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #burpple #mochaart

First photo with my new Instagram name: phoodandtravel hahaha went to celebrate at #dgoodcafe with @thedandeliondream the last day of lectures! We had pasta (will upload those soon), mocha, latte (aren\'t the art cute? And the mocha was good!), waffle with fruits and maple syrup (the waffle was a little too thick for my taste but I like that the edges were crispy ^^) and the highlight: Maple Sea Salt Cheesecake!!! This was SUPER good! It had a nice balance of salty and sweet and the maple was really fragrant! There was only one piece left and we were lucky to get it! (This tells you how popular it is!!) what a great way to celebrate the last day of lectures!
