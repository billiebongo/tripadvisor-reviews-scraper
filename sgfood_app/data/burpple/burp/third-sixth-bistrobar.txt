OMG oishii! Crispy on the outside while the squid is still tender , not rubbery woots!
Chicken burger (great sth....is it\'s name) that has some kick ass seasoning and aroma of basil that\'s done just right.
Burger dinners two nights in a row is something I\'ve never done before. But it was a good chance for me to compare everything I had tonight to what I had last night. Patties-wise I actually preferred last night\'s? Only because I thought this one was a bit dried out and harder in texture. That said, neither of the two burgers made the cut for me. I\'m still searching for that elusive SEASONED beef patty in my burger!! ðŸ˜ª the plus-points about this burger were: the bacon strips (omg so good).
Perfect for a chilled out night with friends over good food and beer, you\'d be hard-pressed to find a more value-for-money dining spot in this area. Start by sharing some wings or Spam fries, then get the classic No. 36 Burger ($16) â€” so satisfying with it\'s simple goodness. The perfectly cooked bacon and just-melted cheese are the keys to the success of this burger, and the portion just enough to fill you. Wash it all down with ice cold pints!
Definitely recommend their tandoori grilled fish. 
I can\'t believe I didn\'t burpple this earlier. But better late than never. If you love burgers and/or beef and/or Mexican chilli, you must try this. It\'s beef on beef between soft buns with cheese and salsa - it\'s messy, but then again, there\'s no other way I\'d like it. 
Their trademark burger come with bacon, caramelized onions and cheddar cheese, with tomatoes, pickles, onions and lettuce on the side. This was also only $14, and all I need to say is that I\'ll be back next week, just to stuff my face with this simple, amazing burger. Last night I wished I had space for 2.
For just $14, these are the biggest fish n chips I\'ve ever had, and definitely one of the better ones around. Pio, the friendly menu creator, explained that he ensures each portion of mains weighs enough to be filling for a human being. These beer-battered, spice-marinated fish with steak cut fries was perfectly crispy and every bit satisfying. Don\'t forget to add malt vinegar ! And yes, it was reaaaally filling. 
Great value. Great Taste. This was the No.36 burger. Simple but shiok. Ask the staff for the Chef\'s special sauce. ;)

I love this chicken wings~ Hehehe. It\'s called #yomomoso . Cute name huh. Lol! #foodie #foodstagram #foodporn
The owner explained to us that Yomoso means \"your momma sauce\" Cus they get their homemade sauce from one of the owner\'s mother.
pretty yummy 
These wings are everything you could want in a chicken wing. Crispy skin under a deliciously sticky coating of owner Eddy\'s mum\'s Korean homemade yomomosauce that is perfect with an ice cold pint. Could\'ve eaten a dozen on my own. Do NOT miss these!! These bad boys will have you licking your fingers and scooping up the sauce with leftover veggies. Oh, and ask the friendly owners why they\'ve named it as such ;) 
Soooooo good.
