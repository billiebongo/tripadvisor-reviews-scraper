Those who are not so much into raw fish can explore the few options in the Donburi section of the menu here. The Aburi Duck Teriyaki + Onsen Egg (also $10) and this came highly recommended, and I‚Äôm glad to report that this was good too (though I personally prefer Japanese Curry Express\' partially torched riff of this dish).
This bowl is possibly the cheapest one around considering the amount of fish you‚Äôre getting! You might be tempted to go big with the premium version, but the normal size would suffice for most. 
Go big or go home. Went for the premium chirashi that offers double the servings. The salmon is really fresh and the rice is on the sweet side. If you‚Äôre looking for fat chunks of fish cubes at a really good price, this is it. Pro-tip: get a premium and some sides to share. There‚Äôll be enough.
For those who think the $10 portion is a little on the small side, District Sushi offers a $20 portion named the Premium Chirashi Don that would definitely suit the biggest of Chirashi Don cravings ‚Äî it comes with the same exact variety of fish but double the portion in an entire mound. Fish is fresh, well marinated in a sweet-savoury sauce that is also drenched atop the sweet sushi rice beneath. Again, this is simply value-for-money; possibly one of the cheapest places for a good bowl of Bara Chirashi Don with the quantity around!
From District Sushi, a new Japanese eatery that is situated at Sunshine Plaza in between Zenso and Thai Gold Food ‚Äî the place actually serves up some seriously affordable Japanese fare like this Bara Chirashi Don that costs only $10(! ‚Äî say whuttt), as well as Sushi and Sashimi as well.
Had the $10 nett Bara Chirashi Don and Mentai Scallops (not in picture). The bara chirashi was value for money but I found the tuna texture to be a bit off. However, if you aren‚Äôt too fussy, the thick morsels of salmon, octopus and tuna sashimi topped with a cooked prawn will be enough to impress the average Japanese food lover with that pricing! Sweeten the meal with ice cream at Merely‚Äôs just two stores down (salted butterscotch is their best seller).
At an affordable $13 for a bowl of chunky well marinated seafood cuts.
Whilst the latter‚Äôs salmon slab exists in a heavenly state between solid-liquid, the former‚Äôs belly is decidedly F45 Training-esque in its athletic firmness. 3.6/5
However, the rice were disappointing, being very plain instead of tasting like sushi rice.

Good deal! When the bowls arrived, it struck me as another version of Sushiro (at Thomson) - both sweet sauces are good and fragrant and pretty generously provided. Fish chunks are big and fresh though, well marinated. It is tasty and yummy. However, I was quite disappointed with the rice I had - rice is not tasty and not well cooked as there are some portions which are hard. Service such as refilling of green tea is found wanting but maybe this restaurant is catered to the student and less demanding crowd. All in all, it is good value with the exception of the rice. The rice is the core of any good Japanese restaurant. Hope that it can be better. Afterall, I do stay nearby and wish to come back too! üê≥MerRyan is satisfied. #barachirashi #chirashi #japanesefood #japanesefoodsg #sunshineplaza #burpple
Informed and was told to top up $5 for ikura. What kind of service is this? üëé
Huge chunks of marinated Sashimi that wasn\'t too salty. Wondered why the prawn is fully cooked rather than raw. The remaining menu was tad expensive, sushi sold in 2 pieces cost at least $4. 2 pieces of Tamago mentaiyaki sushi for $6? No way man. \n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan

A real steal for $10nett! Generous helping of fish marinated in a delightful savoury-sweet sauce. Would have preferred more salmon over the rather tasteless tuna, but no complaints given the price here
Generous slices of salmon. Really good deal at $10 too!
