French duck leg slow cooked for 6 hours with 12 herbs &amp; spices topped with real mashed potato, cherry tomatoes and broccoli drizzled with secret citrus sauce „Äã$16
Came for the waffle &amp; we weren\'t disappointed. Worth braving the weekend lunch crowd for. Unlike regular pizzas, the pizza waffle remains good &amp; soft even when it\'s all cooled down because we were talking too much. As expected, cheese is good in all respects. (Off topic: anyone who lacks cheese in life can refer to SJK in DOTS. He is so cheesey I cannot.) Also enjoyed the duck confit. It was a wee bit ËÄÅ (old) but still good. I actually didn\'t care much for the duck because the mashed potato &amp; zesty sauce stole the show. Seriously, I will love anyone that can cook me that every day. Also, I take really shitty pictures of my food these days.
$8 Honey Paprika Wings. $12 Bacon and Honey Baked Ham Pasta in Neapolitan Sauce. personally like their honey wings. Its my second visit. I visit this cafe when I have to go Dressabelle for shopping. heh. some food before shopping. oh, there\'s no GST or service charge. 
Another duck confit done beautifully! Chunks of potato amidst the bed of smooth mashed potatoes covered with mixture of tangy citrusy sauce and brown sauce. Sweet and savory taste that makes you salivates even at the thought of it! Duck were cooked to perfection with the skin crispy and meat pink and tender. Accompanying salad were so green and fresh too. Portion was good at a reasonable price of $16! Can\'t wait to go back and lay my hands on their other dishes! 
Truffle Infused Creamy Mushroom Pasta ($15)
Drizzle with honey and dusted with paprika, these wings were quite juicy despite being small. But, they were on the sweeter side, as i could taste more of the honey than the paprika. Would be much better if there is a balanced flavour between the two. 
The waffle was slightly crispy on the outside, puffy and soft inside. Although the maple syrup and vanilla ice cream make every bite of the waffle satisfying, I think the $12 will be better spent on waffles at many other caf√©s.
üò® Your guess is as good as mine. I think they had most likely reheated the duck leg to the extent of getting the skin burnt. Look how charred it was. . . But the duck leg meat was indeed infused with lots of herbs. I love how tender and soft the meat was as I could debone it pretty easily. The tangy citrus sauce works it magic by enhancing the savory taste of the duck. Oh, we cleaned the plate as the mashed potato goes so well with the blanched veggies on the side. üëç
Crispy fries with lots of melted cheddar cheese drizzled with mayo and garnished with parsley. So sinful! But I\'m not ashamed of my guilty pleasure. Haha üòô
Crispy on the outside, juicy and moist inside. But we were more impressed by the tastiness. The wings were savory and spiced. What made them so desirable? The honey that was generously drizzled over them. üòç
It was super duper hot this morning but this cold, sweetly spiced and rich thai iced milk tea cooled me down almost instantly. Not sure what makes it \"authentic\" but it sure is one of the best drinks offered at this cafe. Must-try! üòâ
At SGD$12 a bowl, this is an expensive appetiser when you have SGD$15 mains. Probably fries are always beat seller thus the price tag to make the profit. This bowl came out greasy that I keep telling myself it is the truffle oil.
Another simple dish which sadly didn\'t release the aroma of synthetic truffles when served. The pasta was creamy but bland which led to the sprinkling of amounts of tabasco and pepper.
Never quite understand the cafe\'s name but this place sure has the crowd on Sundays. Simple salad in valsamic vinegarette. Nothing fantastic to wow for except its price at SGD$7. I am not sure if the chicken was freshly prepared on the same day but doesn\'t tastes like it was.
Pizza waffle ($14) , honey wings 10 pieces for ($8) , spicy aglio olio ($12) 
What\'s more to say? The food here is so affordable although there isn\'t a lot of choices to choose from the menu . Price range from ($8-$16) 
üç¥The Volcano waffle : charcoal waffle with molten lava cake, vanilla icecream ,marshmallow and waffle sticks $18 
previously i wanna try their signature panna cotta but it was sold out. when i was there last wk i managed to get it. Their Signature Panna Cotta is Dark Chocolate Base with some crispy crumbs with it. It is smooth &amp; light it is not too overly sweet. Cost u $6 Come give it a try. This Cafe Sold their food at nett price no GST &amp; no Service Charge. Price is Reasonable
how fickle the weather today is. one moment it pours, the next we\'re treated to a tirade of warm gust.
check out these 3 beef dishes by @23jumpin.  the ribeye beef burger for the burger fanatics, the hamburger steak which won my heart and the original ribeye steak for the old fashioned.
Some of the older items such as Spicy Chicken burger and Dark Choc Panna Cotta were removed.
10 half-cut wings for $8. Being half-cut meant less hassle to eat. Loved the crunch, sweetness from drizzled honey and mild spiciness from the paprika. This might replace Lola\'s as my favourite..?
Hot weather call me for thai milk tea. Thick n not overly sweet. 
A lot of times you get truffle infused dishes that smells good but with only very subtle hints (or none) of truffle, but the truffle infused creamy pasta with mushrooms, bacons and sprinkles of Parmesan was lovely. I couldn\'t find any fault with the dish, though, it could be quite filling to eat it at one go. 
Though tucked in a relatively quiet neighborhood in a seemingly \'abandoned\' mall, 23 Jumpin was buzzing with life on a lazy weekend. There\'s limited amount of space so it\'s likely that you have to queue. But the food and the coffee is really good, do try it out if you\'re around the area at Tai Seng. 
Despite being tucked away at a relatively quiet area, 23 Jumpin was packed with people! Maybe it was because it\'s a public holiday, but we definitely enjoyed the food that we ordered. The honey paprika wings are a must-order! It\'s finger lickin\' good and the dripping fragrant honey just adds to the oomph! 
Crispy waffle and love the slightly burnt marshmallows! Could have more ice cream varieties for ice cream though. Nevertheless, vanilla icecream goes well with everything!
It looks better than it taste. We found it to cheesy but the waffle is nice.
good portion for a creamy pasta. just nice for 1 person.
Another addition to the waffle menu here. Cocoa flavours were evident in the waffle batter, which reveals red colour when cut open. Smart play of flavours for the lemon white chocolate cream cheese which was smooth and luscious; sweet and tangy, with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on top. While it was rather decent tasting, the waffles could have been done less limp and crispier on the exterior for maximum pleasure.
Honey Paprika Mid-wings [$8], Matcha Latte [$4.50] and Truffle Infused Creamy Pasta [$15]. So far these are the few better ones in the cafe scene. Can\'t wait to be back for more!
Taste pretty good and not forgetting having their honey paprika wings as our appetisers! One of the cafes that i deemed is good at around the taiseng Area! Do check it out if you haven\'t! It\'s located just near taiseng mrt at the commerze building! Thanks @23jumpin &amp; Gary for having us there! #burpple
.\n<br />|\n<br />Three words to describe it. Sweet, crispy and spicy. I could easily finish one by my own.
|\n<br />I didn\'t really like the Hawaii but the mushroom cheese I like. Savory topping with sweet fluffy base. Interesting and not a bad try. .\n<br />|\n<br />23 Jumpin\n<br /># 01-25, 1 Irving Place, The Commerze Building, Singapore 369546\n<br />‚òéÔ∏è Tel: +65 9137 5697\n<br />‚è∞ Opening Hours: 11am-9pm (Tues ‚Äì Sun), 11am-2pm (Mon)
But good food can be shared anytime of the day. Honey bacon, buttery toast and perfect scramble egg. (Don\'t really like pasta salad). Love every mouth.
A little salty, but that\'s fine. A lot of meat. It\'s very fragrant. I like it. It\'s $12. (4/5)
Yummy as it might be. You sure can DIY. (4/5)
thick and fragrant thai milk tea ($4.50) üëç for the first time ever, I had two servings of a drink to accompany my meal.
Located in quite an empty building at Taiseng, it\'s of walking distance from the mrt station. The place was quite packed at noon, but we managed to get a seat immediately (there wasn\'t a waiting list) as a couple was just leaving at the time. ok. I\'m just going straight to their food cos it\'s just too good. yes. especially their waffle pizza! Am a fan of waffles, mostly sweet ones but this savoury waffle certainly did not disappoint. Didn\'t get to taste the highly raved wings as I couldn\'t take spicy stuff. but my partner eating it had nothing but praises for those gorgeous wings. Love their new item, the thai iced milk tea too! üòç Items featured in the photo includes: Jumpin\'s Ultimate Breakfast $15/Hawaiian Pizza Waffle $14/Honey Paprika Wings $8/Thai Iced Milk Tea $4.50. Total bill sums up to about $40+. Verdict: Love all the food I\'ve tried there. Highly recommended and I would see myself returning.. if not for my quest to try more cafesüòÖ 4.30/5.0.
Constantly releasing new items on their menu, 23 Jumpin has just released the Thai Iced Milk Tea ($4.50)! The fragrance of the milk tea remains there even when a lot of ice has been added to it, and remains flavorful and concentrated!
Honey paprika wings, 8 for $10. Like the idea of half cut wings, so much easier to eat. And these wings are addictive, so crispy yet flavorful.
It looked awesome, except that the ice cream was melting too quickly, the air conditioning at 23 Jumpin needs adjusted, the high ceiling doesn\'t melt and it was quite hot in there. My black volcano waffle didn\'t like the temperature either. The charcoal waffle was sadly again, mushy, but on the edges it was crispy. The lava cake did flow which was great! 
So 23 Jumpin came up with the idea of Pizza Waffles, so it\'s their iconic dish, however I was very upset to hear that they did not have any Hawaiian pizza waffles that day. Oh dear! We settled for 2 mushroom pizza waffles. Boy do they smell delicious! The waffles look so brown and crisp but sadly, the waffles were very mushy. I did like the melted cheese and mushrooms on top, but I think they need to figure out a way to keep the waffles crispy! It was quite a let down, but nonetheless an interesting dish to try!
This changes everything. Hawaiian x Mushroom pizza toppings with a thick fluffy waffle base. Indeed, 23 Jumpin has set the benchmark for savoury waffles.
Always have a thing for such jar! By the way, 23 jumpin have a new menu on the house which is the Black volcano waffle - chocolate molten lava cake on top of the charcoal waffle, peaked with malted Oreo icecream, topped with toasted marshmallows and waffles sticks oozed with chocolate sauce ! Sounds really yummy but it was too much for me so I shall head over another day! üòã #23jumpin #burpple
The D\'or charcoal waffles is light and fluffy, so it doesn\'t fill you so much. There\'s a taste of deep sweetness such that it\'s not too sweet, nor buttery, nor tasteless..it\'s just nice such that you can comfortably have it without the ice-cream and still enjoy every mouthful like potato chips. The Oreo+malt ice-cream is creamy and solid and it doesn\'t melt easily. I love the colour against the black volcano waffles. Eggs Benedict is normal, but better than many places I have tried. Fried chicken is crispy, sweet and spicy - a heavenly combination!
Mushroom pizza waffles was good despite of the smell of cheese being too strong. Honey paparika wings were really awesome and addictive!
the charcoal waffles are fluffy and yum, ice cream choice is standard, vanilla however you can choose to add $1.50 for their other flavors available like thai milk tea or Oreo (ice cream choices may change). taste of the waffles are like ordinary ones so don\'t be afraid of any charcoal taste you might taste! I love waffles personally so everything is appealing to me
No fret because they had it in 23 jumpin too! Located at taiseng just nearby the Mrt only! Do check it out if you are nearby üòâ (feat Gary\'s hands)
Tasted much like Lola\'s cafe wings! However smaller in size. Very juicy and tasty! Highly recommended üëçüèºüëçüèº
Not a food item out on their list yet, but 23 Jumpin\'s Charcoal Waffles with Thai Milk Tea ice cream tasted rather good! The Charcoal Waffles is crisp on the outside, moist and flavourful on the inside though it didn\'t quite match well with the Thai Milk Tea ice cream as the ice cream had a milder taste to accompany.
Usually the Duck Confit is more to Savory Version but here it is mixture of sweet &amp; savory. When i eat it, the meat is tender totally melt into mouth &amp; good that they serve mashed potatoes with seasonal vegetables. Usually Their Seasonal Vegetable will change pls do check with the staff before ordering the duck confit.
My 1st time eating the fries. Look like many cafe are selling it but if u are looking for good &amp; reasonable price go to @23jumpin. It only cost u $12. One of the worth trying. @carl_holmberg @lepakwithyaops let go there soon
I simply love their egg benedict because of it watery egg york it goes well with muffin &amp; ham. Here cost u $14 where u go other place to eat will cost u abt $20. Why not give it a try here
Tried their new creamy pasta infused with truffle oil and it tastes so so good! Things here are always nice and affordable! Can\'t find a good spot to take photo since it\'s dark so i decided to take my shot in the kitchen on their table! üòÇ
A pile of bones were left when I started on my last piece... so, who ate the rest?!? These little addictive crispy devils, slightly spicy and a slight tinge of sweetness from the honey. Wishing they applied more honey on them though, we were desperately scraping honey off the serving board üòÇ
Hmmmm...... didn\'t really find it fantastic... didn\'t know what I was really eating?  Anyone enlighten me please?
That the reason why @gwenfoodvolution &amp; @fatboygoodeats went ahead before me.  Finally i am here with my lunch companion @candice.huang @debbiehuang @johnbeckz @kenn_evans. The Cafe Serve Many type of food &amp; even all day brunches.So i order the mushroom toasted cheese bread. The bread is crispy &amp; soft the cheese &amp; mushroom make the perfect combination.

It\'s waffle pizza! We ordered the duo flavors. The mushroom cheese and Hawaiian. Can skip the Hawaiian and just go for the mushroom cheese! It\'s really nice and unique! By the way, this cafe is pretty hidden among the industrial buildings.
Crispy wings with juicy meat doused in honey for sweetness and sprinkling of paprika to induce a hint of spiciness. Great to pair with the Irish Latte that carries a douse of Bailey\'s!
One of the latest menu offerings on 23Jumpin that\'s not listed on the menu (but just ask for it; it\'s just not stated). This one\'s pretty dreamy, full of Bailey\'s so much that you can just fool others you are not into alcohol, yet indulge in your guilty pleasures.
But there\'s apparently a stretch of eateries in a light industrial building called Commerze next to the MRT. Matcha Latte ($4.50) and Pork Goulash ($12) and Bangers ($8). Pretty decent food. Worth trying if you happen to be nearby! \n<br />#burpple
Jumpin\'s Original Cotta\n<br />It looks dark grey in color but is actually extra dark chocolate.
cny must havd came early cause i swore the the bacon i had was so bak kwaish. bratwurst was succulent and delish. love that the fluffy scrambled eggs here was on a lighter note, pairing it well with the other savory items.
dont belittle this no frills outfit. they do without the fancy decor and industrialish whatnots to bring you a mean plate of eggs benedict. simple components in a egg benny but not an easy feat to accomplish. jumpin delivered a full set of lovely white here and a teasing careful hey-there poke got me an instantaneous come hither am ready to flow reply. i will BRB.
today\'s coffee situation: drinking coffee due to science. lol. and a decent cup of flat white it was! gotta admit it was quite an indecent distance to get here from tuas to tai seng though.
It is a unique combination but both the waffle and pizza toppings tasted so ordinary. Nothing really special but not bad.
It\'s a Pizza Waffle! 23 Jumpin unveils the unique waffle, which currently comes in two flavours: Mushroom &amp; Cheese and Hawaiian. Fancy trying both at one go? Ask for two halves! Very intriguing new creation which certainly warrants a try. Photo by #BurppleTastemaker Chua Xing Wei #Burpple
I love my food spicy, so this simple dish really hit the spot for me, especially since the chicken came buried under nacho cheese and mayo.
There\'s too many variants of waffles we had seen everywhere; ice-cream waffles, fried chicken waffles and even chocolate waffles, but 23Jumpin does a variant that is refreshing in the scene. Combining waffles and pizza, the Pizza Waffles comes in two flavours currently; Mushroom &amp; Cheese and a Hawaiian. Sitting atop a crisp and moist waffle that\'s full of buttery aroma, you could actually taste the batter even though it comes with a generous portion of cheese for both flavours. Mushroom &amp; Cheese was creamy and earthy; pretty rich and should appeal to those who love their mushrooms. My personal favourite was the Hawaiian which comes with tomato sauce spread, topped with ham and pineapples. The juicy cubes of pineapple does the trick with its zestiness which gives the Pizza Waffle a refreshing flavour boost. Fancy both flavours? You can order a Yuan Yang where you get to have both just like how I did. Thanks to owner Gary who invited me down to try out their newest creation served on their menu.
Sounds so gimmicky, but the waffle topped with mushrooms on one side, and ham and pineapple (Hawaiian) on the other were among the best I\'ve had ‚Äì the exterior of the waffle was perfectly browned and crisp, while the insides remained plush and moist.
yes you haven\'t heard wrong, pizza made on a waffle. currently comes in two flavors - hawaiian or mushroom cheese, or if you can\'t decide, the yuan yang. \n<br />found the batter to be really fragrant. the waffle served was not soggy even when with all those ingredients above. a unique dish by one of the newer kids on the block.
Comes in 2 halves of different flavors: Mushroom &amp; Cheese and Hawaiian!
Here\'s Charcoal Waffle w Ice Cream ($9), with a choice of vanilla or chocolate. The waffles were pretty good but wouldn\'t say the same for the ice cream though. More details on the blog, jacqsowhat.com üòå
There\'s a 23% launch promotion going on till the end of this week too! GRAB YOUR LUNCH BUDDIES AND HEAD ON THERE NOW!
With toppings of mushroom cheese and Hawaiian-style ham and pineapples, this pizza-waffle was tastier than what I had expected! Thumbs up for the good combination! üëç\n<br />And thank you @23jumpin for letting me try this ahead of its official launch (which is today)! üòÅ\n<br />#burpple

The eggs were soft and nicely cooked. The bread was lightly toasted; crispy on the outside yet soft and fluffy on the inside. The sausage, bacon, and ham while tasty were nothing special. The salad I felt had a tad bit too much vinaigrette but was otherwise quite fresh. The dish overall was lukewarm, probably cause each item was prepared individually. It was a bit of a bummer since a good breakfast is determined by how well the food comes together. Would recommend this place for their other dishes (pasta and duck confit) though. Cost $15 and was a rather satisfying portion. 
Team lunch at the new cafe in the Tai Seng area. Hidden behind dark glass doors, 23 Jumpin serves affordable cafe fare without compromising on the taste. The Spicy Chicken Burger ($8) was marinated with a chilli padi mix before pan frying and then drizzled with mayonnaise and melted cheese. Be warned for the tint of spiciness in between your tastebuds after the first bite.  
Duck could have been more moist and the skin more crisp. Wonderfully marinated, the meat had a slight herbal taste that went well with the sauce which had a slight tinge of sourness that was refreshing. The vegetables were boiled nicely! Mash potato was creamy and heavenly with some bite to it. Definitely worth a try, priced at $16.
Interior was completely minimal, not much decor. üòÅ Food was rather decent, latte art need more work though. Plus point, a stone throw away from Tai Seng Mrt station.
Stay safe and enjoy yourself in korea! Can i say that this pasta is really really good! Damn awesome! Floor shot for the win! ================================\n<br />#firstgram2015 of 2015! Hopefully 2015 will be an awesome year for me! I hope i will improve more on my photography skills through out all my Insta meet! Gonna head back to what I loved in the past- dancing! During this remaining days of NS, I hope to gain back something meaningful and learn something new!
Finally here and i must say that their food and drinks are of good quality! Gonna come back for their duck confit next time and can i say both @shauneeie &amp; me love my creamy pasta! Aglio olio is good too! Eggs Benedict i think is good but shaun say he still prefer sprkt market one! Have an awesome last day on 2014!
prolly de last cafe I\'m visiting in 2014, and surprisingly serving really good food in this industrial area. üòãüòã
Would not have realised it\'s a cafe because the glass doors are tinted black. Why like that? \n<br />Anyway, I got recognized (is it that easy to recognise me) and boss said \"Oh no I could have served you better.\" Haha. My recommendation for him is, serve all customers the same, the best you can. :)
Got a jumpin original cotta and matcha latte, the tiramisu was complimentary ^^  To be honest, the cotta wasn\'t to my liking, it wasn\'t chocolatey enough and had more of a fudgy mouse texture. Didn\'t go too well with the slightly salty biscuit crumbs on top. But as for the tiramisu, it was really good üëç Although I wouldn\'t mind if there was a bit more alcohol. Hehe. Loved the matcha latte as well! It wasn\'t too sweet and had enough matcha taste :)
Definitely not an ensemble cast, so the show desperately lacks a lead star. The pasta inclusion is peculiar, and I sure wished the piglet representation was more substantial. Bacon needs to be the crispy type, any other variant just won\'t do! 3.25/5
Tai Seng may be a sleepy industrial estate that seems to have nothing in relation to coffee and brunch, but the recent opening of TheCommerz saw a bunch of eateries commencing operations at the first level of the industrial building. 23Jumpin is one of them that is hidden behind dark tinted glass. It is the first F&amp;B venture for the owner, and him mum helms the kitchen and churns out all-day brunch and entrees. Must-tries include the Duck Confit which is all tender and comes with a really delicious tangy citrus sauce that sends the oomph to your tastebuds. While desserts are supplied, the Jumpin\'s Original Cotta is a creation unique to 23Jumpin; a fortunate result of miscommunication that they decided to stick to and offer as a permanent menu item instead. Coffee is also something to boast; they use a zero-acidity blend from a local coffee roaster to suit the tastes of locals. With the food served at reasonable rates, there is no reason why you should not head down for a visit!
Thicker then usual foam then other cafes, which I fancy. Regular at $4.50 NETT. Coffee at 30% off opening special.
Perfectly poached eggs with creamy flavourful hollandaise sauce. NETT price at $14 (15% off opening special till today)
Savoury duck with well balanced orange sauce which goes well with the mashed potatoes. NETT price of $16 (15% off opening discount)
The creme and the brulee didn\'t have a good marriage. $5 NETT.
How did this 1-month old cafe fare in both of my visits there? Check out its review on fatassbean.wordpress.com
Nice patty and serving is just nice. Not forgetting they are having discount too..
The mash is nice and smooth.I like the black onion sauce too..
Who says you need a turkey for Thanksgiving? A duck confit still does its job well. With such a tender and flavourful duck confit thst has meat that is easily shredded from the bones, who can resist the temptation not to eat it? You will soon find yourself swallowing the entire thing without realising because it\'s so convenient to eat when everything comes off easily!
But, I\'ve received the best service here at @23jumpin.
Located near Tai Seng MRT station, 23 Jumpin joins the party of cafes in the East, offering affordable menu items great for brunch. Their simple and minimalistic decor creates a cool space to chill over some eggs benedict, bangers and mash, duck confit, and burgers. For dessert, try Jumpin\'s Orginal Cotta - their innovative take on the classic panna cotta, with a dark chocolate base and a generous sprinkle of peanuts to top it off.
Lately having many cravings for Eggs Benedict. Break the runny yolks for some sunny goodness on the soft, fluffy English muffins. The Hollandaise sauce is just right; not too tart and maintained a creamy consistency. Served with Mesculun Salad for a refreshing crunch.
This was so good that it got me raving about it over and over after we finished the whole plate of it. Tender duck came off the bone easily, and was given a tart flavour from the citrus sauce that came drizzled. Mash was savoury with brown sauce, and saut√©ed vegetables though plain, was soft to bite. I have got a feeling this is something I would crave badly for!
According to the owner, their Original Cotta was more of an accidental finding, where the supplier ended up supplying them extremely dark chocolate Panna Cottas instead of the usual chocolate Panna Cotta. Despite being warned that it is going to be intense, there is no extreme bitterness involved. It is a smooth pudding that is only a tinge sweet, yet custardy with a hint of cocoa. Add those crumbles up and there\'s some crunch for a texture. Who said mishaps have to be a bad thing?
23Jumpin uses an exclusive roast of beans supplied by local roaster Kaans which is tailor-made for them. Their blend boasts a no-acidity flavour profile to suit the tastes of locals, and indeed there is zero traces of fruity accents, just nutty notes in its aftertaste along with the smooth and creamy cuppa.
The burger is served with greens to complement the burger which is tossed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar . Meat patty is drizzled with a generous serving of mayonnaise and melted cheese and is well marinated with chilli padi before panfrying, giving it an extra hot punch. The patty is tender and juicy but be warned that it can be slightly spicy. Even the bread for the burger is panfried before serving to give it a slight crunch.
An innovative way of using dark chocolate for their panna cotta. Love the crunchy peanuts bits scattered on it and has the right level of sweetness. Texture is smooth and be warned that it can be quite a big serving.

Lol! This mocha at #23jumpin is quite decent but not exceptional. Good amount of coffee with milk but would prefer a less sweet chocolate. But nevertheless a nice one.
Ordered this interesting #spicychickenburger which uses a deep fried chicken filet with a spicy Indian sauce. Pretty neat I gotta say. I would have preferred the chicken to be more crisper but that just me. The sauce is pretty good, added a very contrasting taste to the whole burger. Quite refreshing burger but the overall service of the place can be improved.
Meat was so tender! 
Citrus sauce was deliciously tangy. $16 nett #burpple #cafe #cafehopping #taiseng #23jumpin #sgcafe #sgfoodies #duckconfit

Humble, passionate and hardworking, he is listens and continues to improve his food and biz. Even his servers are well trained and friendly to the diners. So it is heartwarming to see his cafe doing so well today with a full house from the moment we came till we left this lunch period today. And here\'s the honey paprika winglets that are so additives good that you will want more after the last piece. And super affordable too :)\n<br />#23jumpin #honey #paprika #winglets #friedchicken #sgfood #food #foodporn #burrple

Not very spicy lah but served hot and crispy, drizzled with honey.

Option of hot or cold, so I chose hot \'cos that\'s a better way to taste the beans. Coffee is the bold, choc and nutty type, can\'t go wrong. Service is good, boss is friendly. Check \'em out and try their Waffle Pizzas or Hot Paprika Wings which you\'ll see in my post later. \n<br />#eatwithroy #foodie #foodporn #foodsg #foodgasm #foodblog #sgfoodblogger #sgfood #foodpics #sgig #igsg #bigroysg #instafood #roysingapore #ieatisnapicrap #supportlocal #supportsmallbusinesses #sg50 #8dayseat #burpple #eatoutsg #wewantsugar #pickatsg #singaporeinsiders #willtravelforfood #sgcafefood #thefindersingapore #23jumpin

There\'s a taste of deep sweetness such that it\'s not too sweet, nor buttery, nor tasteless..it\'s just nice such that you can comfortably have it without the ice-cream and still enjoy every mouthful like potato chips. The Oreo+malt ice-cream is creamy and solid and it doesn\'t melt easily. Eggs Benedict is normal, but better than many places I have tried. Fried chicken is crispy, sweet and spicy - a heavenly combination!\n<br />#23Jumpin #foodporn #sgfood #mocha #sgfoodies #burpple #sgcafe #sgcafes #coffee #cafehopping #cafesg #sgfoodtrend #cafes #sgcafehopping #sgfoodies #sgcafefood #asian #instafood #cafehoppingsg #Singapore #whati8today #sgig #igsg  #brunch #sgmakanplaces #sgmakandiary  #igsg #instasg #hungrygowhere #foodpanda #ginapala #foodgasm

Every single one of them is so aromatic and filled with the strong taste of truffle oil. Definitely the best truffle fries I\'ve ever had so far. üòã\n<br />#sgfood #Foodphotography
The wings are definitely a must-try!
Egg benedict with honey paprika wings.
Drizzled with said honey, and sprinkled with paprika and parsley flakes, I can easily finish an additional 2 sets of this wonderfully crafted wings. Love the presentation of the dish as well.
Well at least it was decent coffee just added with some additive.
Those wanna try i have no obilgation
Lol!
They are all single bone which made eating easier! Ultra crispy, full of flavors, sprinkle with spices and drizzle with honey! Wah!! I give 5/5 ratings!
They should have a delivery service for this. Alternatively, can someone just eat this on my behalf? üò´
Awesome food and reasonable pricing.
Really excited to try this! Quite good actually üòãüòãüòã
üôÜ Half hawaiian and half mushroom üçïüççüçÑ #burpple
Had the pretty novel and unique creation: Pizza Waffle!! üçï. Half hawaiian and half mushroom, it tasted pretty decent. Optimally cheesy pizza texture with decently crispy waffle texture. Fusion went pretty well tho I would say I love the mushroom one more than hawaiianüòÇ.\n<br />Dessert wise, the Jumpin Original Cotta was really a simple yet good dish! The chocolate had this tiramisu-moouse-pudding texture which went well the crumbs, making the dessert a hearty, sweet and not so queasy to the  gut after consumption! Definitely worth a try! üòéüëçüòâ\n<br />#sgfood #burrple #cafehopping #instafood #foodstagram #eatoutsg #igfoodies #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgcafe #vscocam #hungrygowhere #openricesg #sgig
Squish.
One of the better iced mochas I\'ve had at @23jumpin.
Love this duck confit with special sauce on top to give a slight tang and a robust coffee to complete the satisfying meal!

I can\'t stop recommending because they are so photogenic and taste pretty good too! üôä or \n<br />Im just hungry in class.
This is why I\'m fat.
And my way of saying GOOD MORNING, TIME FOR YOUR CAFFEINE FIX!
EAT ALL THE FOOD!
Yay to awesome food and good conversation with the boss
Hidden behind dark glass doors, 23 Jumpin serves affordable cafe fare without compromising on the taste. The Spicy Chicken Burger ($8) was marinated with a chilli padi mix before pan frying and then drizzled with mayonnaise and melted cheese. Be warned for the tint of spiciness in between your tastebuds after the first bite. \n<br />#FOODART #singapore #local #makan #burpple #julsmakan #eat #foodporn #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodsg #instafoodsg #igsg #cafehopping #23jumpin #taiseng #chicken #burger
The lighting was actually quite bad so I went to open the main door just to take this shot! üòÇ On a side note, whose up for some cafe hopping in JB really soon? :) probably during the weekends
a week overdue (but Christmas can be anyday), this is something new on their menu - charcoal waffles. a tad too dense but flavor was there.
530pm after work coffee. Was actually complimentary by the cafe\'s owner ‚ò∫Ô∏è smooth and light. Suitable for people that like mild coffees.
They made it up by giving us complimentary cup of coffees! Great service over this newly opened cafe #jm1 @judsonmorgan filter via {#looksee @be_revealed} #23jumpin #burpple
I like their coffee. 
Duck confit ($16) from @23jumpin! The meat was tender and flavorful, when eaten with the mash, PERFECT! Opening special of 30% lasts till the end of November! Hurry down now!
Super good brunch and mains! We are in love!! üòçüòç
How about some tiramisu in a jar bottle. This tiramisu is on the lighter side. Would prefer more potent ladyfingers with a more distinct mascapone cheese.
Their coffee is made from a five-bean blend roasted by Kanz that also supplies Spruce. It has a medium body with zero acidity! Yup this zero acidity totally surprises me and really suits me!
Can\'t wait to visit them for their mains tomorrow! üòä
Was offered a complimentary Tiramisu by the owner as he was looking for some feedback about it. Could find no faults with this one; from thick and luscious mascarpone cream, the alcohol-doused sponge cake and the cocoa dusting, there just is no flaw that we could fault about it.
