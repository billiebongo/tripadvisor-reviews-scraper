The Mee Siam soup here is good! And the grandma chocolate is not too sweet. And it\'s served warm, to my surprise. 
It is so so tender. The meat is ready to drop off at the touch of the fork. Please read all about it at www.hungryghost.sg
The Royals Cafe is a cafe that serves Singapore fare that is halal-certified. This is their Singnature Nonya Mee Siam. Please read all about it at www.hungryghost.sg
A very hearty dish. Would prefer it to be spicier with a thicker consistency! 
Slightly thicker sauce as compared to the usual Malay Mee Siam. Comes with a few prawns, hard boiled egg, tau pok, bean sprouts. SGD 5.90 + 10% service fee. Very friendly waiters and waitresses. You can also get a set that comes with drinks and a small slice of cake.
Here, this version comes with Ayam masak merah which makes this paring quite uncommon. But it’s certainly bold and exciting especially when I’ve never tried this combo before! Oh wait! Check out those perfect sunny side up!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#theroyalscafe#nasilemak#ayammasakmerah#coconutrice#siglap#cafesg#localdelights#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#halalsg#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Pretty light overall with ondeh x2 flavor crying out! And the best part it is not that sweet! Very good job reducing sugar and yet retaining the flavor!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#theroyalscafe#ondeh#ondehondeh#ondehondehcake#siglap#cafesg#cake#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#halalsg#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#cakes#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Hands down! Wait.. technically, it’s not even a burger.. so maybe not. But it’s close to its traditional heritage form apart from the green burger rice patty.. what can I say, I totally couldnt find any fault!  The rice was ‘Lemak’ so be warned ‘anti coconut milk pple!’ Chicken is Cutlet style just the way I like! (boneless) there were some twist though with the orange mayo sauce thing(got to research about the sauce) and the fact the rice is green! But overrall, at $11.90, its a good plate of rice or burger.. whatever you wanna call it! I know I’ll definitely be back for more!👍🏽\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#theroyalscafe#nasilemak#nasilemakburger#coconutrice#siglap#cafesg#localdelights#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#halalsg#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending

Really surprised that it could be found in a cafe. It’s sour/sweet taste really stands out with this one. The chefs indeed knows how to add the correct proportion of zest into the bowl. Along with tao pok, eggs, some nutty bites in the gravy plus tiger prawns, (Yes prawns!) makes this a perfect bowl of Mee Siam!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#theroyalscafe#meesiam#beehoon#nyonya#siglap#cafesg#localdelights#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#halalsg#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
Better than an average Mee Siam but I wish it could be a little rich, a little more oomph. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />Especially when it’s raining outside, I’m always quivering for a bowl of hot soup be it Ramen, Pho, Mee Siam. The comfort of a warm broth in a cold rainy day, I will actually burn cities down just for that warmth. 🏵\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #theroyalscafe #theroyalsSG #nonya #meesiam #peranakan #peranakanfood
The signature nyonya mee siam ($6.90) is an umami-packed savoury comfort dish with a slight spicy kick. If you like your mee siam spicier, you may request for additional sambal chilli (which is equally shiok). This is one of our favourites, and I\'ll be back to this halal-certified cafe for this.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @theroyalssg for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for inviting me.\n<br />-\n<br />[The Royals Cafe]\n<br />19 Upper East Coast Road\n<br />Crescendo Building\n<br />Singapore 455209\n<br />-\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #exploresingapore  #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #foodetection #foodinsing #wishuponatart_eats #nyonya #meesiam #peranakan
Therefore any decent or good establishments will always have an additional option for Cheese as the Perfect Endings. If not, any cakes, desserts or sweet will do just fine. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #theroyalscafe #theroyalssg #sugarcakepie #redvelvet #chocolatecake #chocolate #ondehondeh #cake

-\n<br />The Nasi (rice) patty is aromatic with the coconut milk fragrance - perfect base for the fried chicken and the awweeeesome sambal chilli. Not overly spicy (which is great for me) yet robust enough to have anyone craving for more! For the cool kids who find sambal chilli too mainstream, there is also the option of having the sambal mayo instead of the traditional sambal chilli. Both tastes good but I’m all for the traditional.\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @theroyalssg for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for inviting me.\n<br />-\n<br />[The Royals Cafe]\n<br />19 Upper East Coast Road\n<br />Crescendo Building\n<br />Singapore 455209\n<br />-\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #exploresingapore  #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #foodetection #foodinsing #wishuponatart_eats #nasilemak
But this is one that you can safely OD &amp; go through rehab just to have more. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />The desserts here, the unicorn cake, assorted cake slices are decent.

🥄\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: You choose what you want it to be, it can be either a burger (DIY) or a traditional Nasi Lemak. Fragrant Pandan Coconut-y Milk rice, Juicy Fried Chicken thigh &amp; topped with a Sunny Side up Fried Egg. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />Easily one of the best dishes we tried at the tasting, the homemade sambal is bloody good, spicy that brings a hint of sweetness, a tad salty &amp; savoury which is almost umami &amp; makes you salivate. It\'s the sambal that unifies everything together &amp; yes I just put a condiment on the pedestal.

🍴\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: A gorgeous huge chunk of Lamb Shank Braised till Tender, it doesn\'t really have the gamey smell that turn some away. Velvety Pumpkin Mash mixed in with a dollop of butter for that richness as the Feta Cheese balance it out. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />Once the dish hits the table I was honestly astounded by the size of it. That alone &amp; the execution, I\'d say this is damn worth every penny of yours. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #theroyals #theroyalssg #lamb #shank #lambshank #pumpkin #mash
You can tell why it\'s a hot favourite when you see at least one bowl on each table at the cafe, and streams of customers coming in just to have it to-go! \n<br />I loved how the broth had a just right haebi taste to it, and with the help of some lime, the flavours being amplified so much more. \n<br />If you like it spicy, have a go at the chilli that comes along! I must say, all the different chilies / sambal made at The Royals Cafe is so sooo good. If they sell them as a bottle, I\'m sure to buy myself a couple to bring home. \n<br />Thank you @justinfoodprints for bringing us along &amp; Joy from @theroyalssg for hosting us! •\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG
Riding along a healthy trend, I gotta say it\'s pretty well executed, maybe even Vegetarian. An egg with flowing golden yolk is something I cannot live without. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />Named Zoodle as zucchini is used to as a substitution to Noodles thus its for those \"I\'m on a No Carb Diet Sh*t\" The cafe is leaning towards a new healthier menu that will be launching soon. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #theroyals #theroyalssg #vegetarian #mushroom #zucchini #noodles #egg
🍜\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: I Guess as a Peranakan, I\'m pretty particular about Peranakan Cuisine, on how people cook &amp; present it. The Nyonya Mee Siam here lacked some oomph, the gravy can be a tad thinner &amp; a touch of sourness with a spicer kick should do the trick. 🌶\n<br />.\n<br />However, it\'s still one of the better Nyonya Mee Siam out there. A safer option if one does crave for an Asian dish here. After all, most of not all the Peranakans will claim that their Chor Chor or BiBi makes the best. So taste is subjective I\'d say. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #theroyals #theroyalssg #Nyonyameesiam #nyonya #meesiam #peranakan #peranakanfood
🍠\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Serving both purple &amp; orange sweet potato fries alongside a tangy tartar sauce, the purple sweet potato has a bite to it. The Orange sweet potato is softer but has more fragrance. 🍟\n<br />.\n<br />The batter is light &amp; crispy, it stays as crispy as it is when served pipin hot even after a considerable amount of time we took to take pics. Try to have it once it reaches the table, there\'s just something about Fries straight outta the fryer. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #chefsofinstagram #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #theroyals #theroyalssg #sweetpotato #fries #chips #tartar
