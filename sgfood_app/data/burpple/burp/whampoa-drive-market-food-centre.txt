Worth every single calorie and a definite must try when the in the area. Oysters were juicy and fresh and omelette was nicely crusted yet not overly dry which gave texture to the dish.
The dry gravy here is a personal favourite because of the fermented black beans used. Also, the gravy is not cake-like and still flows despite a thicker viscosity. That soup looks uninspiring but its intense beefy flavour makes you want to finish every last drop of it. Ok, that\'s all.
Soft and silky and not too sweet traditional beancurd 》$1.20
The famous Hokkien mee! We get 3 Pcs of prawns for the $5 portion. The stock is omgee too good that I have only 1 word to describe it - D E L I C I O U S 😄 》$5
Green pandan fragrant coconut rice with the usual Nasi Lemak ingridients, hot &amp; crispy chicken wing and egg with molten yolk 😍 Sambal chili is quite good. Sweet and not overpowering spicy 》$3
Whampoa Food Centre is full of gems.
Like this one. Again, we couldn\'t decide between one or the other, so we ordered the yin yang. But big sigh...we waited too long to start eating this and it became slightly soggy. Also, I think aunty was feeling stingy today because there was very little chye poh and those little bits that were on the plate didn\'t get fried long enough. Ok, that\'s all.
However, that\'s not to say it wasn\'t an enjoyable eat. The fish was fleshy and freshly sweet. The sambal was piquant, spicy and addicting. The thing about this dish being served on a hot plate is the fact that the fish tends to continue cooking on the table, resulting in dryness if left awhile before eating. Ok, that\'s all.
This one is a personal favourite and not the famous one. The broth used has more robust flavours and I love that they use the usual bee hoon instead. The chilli is fried longer, hence the darker colour. When a little cool, the noodles get a little gooey – my most favourite way to eat them. Of course, uncle is more generous with the fried lard too. Here, the sotong is never rubbery, just the right chewiness. Ok, that\'s all.
My humble opinion, you can disagree of course.
This bowl of unpretentious old school beancurd (with toppings) was introduced to me by my dear aunt who stays around the area and loves taking me out for good food. Since then we\'d visit the stall to end a precious day of catch-up on a sweet note. It is also a must-get when my family happens to be around the area. The smooth beancurd here has an unexplainable homely taste, making it a family favorite.\n<br />Toppings wise, I would recommend their red (kidney) beans as unlike the usual bland, small and coarse-textured red beans you get at bad hawker dessert stalls, the ones here are sweet and wholesome!                                                P.s: the stall is right next to Loy Kee chicken porridge &amp; rice \n<br />#hawkerpedia
So called the \"The Best Lor Mee\" as shown on the signboard. However gravy taste not as good as what I am expecting. 
Prices are at $2.50/$3 for a plate. This Wanton Mee from Signature 1.90 Joo Chiat Famous Ya Jiu Wanton Noodles 招牌 1.90 如切著名亚九云吞面 ($2.50) comes with chewy but unfortunately not springy noodles. The wantons given here are not only very little, but they are also less satisfying. The char siew here, on the contrary, tasted nicer here!
Still my favorite stall as the omelette is crispy on the outside, chewy &amp; gooey inside. Sinfully delicious!
Prices are at $3.50/$5 for the soup (excluding the price of the rice). This Pig\'s Organ Soup from Yu Ji Pig\'s Organ Soup &amp; Herbal Mutton Soup ($4 including a bowl of rice) is possibly one of the more balanced Pig\'s Organ Soup that you can get. The salted vegetables and tofu helps to balance the taste coming out from the amount and variety of intestines in this soup! 
very tasty soup and nice bee hoon, also more generous fish compared to others. cheap and really nice ! 
But lucky went out before CNY. If during CNY than no shop open 😊 Went Balestier pump gas and had this Lo Mee 卤面 / 滷麵 (noodles with braised sauce) on the way. Surprisingly quite good. Love the fried flour fritters 😋💦💦💦
What\'s your favourite tau huay combi? Love the smooth, silky tau huay from whampoa beancurd store topped with kidney beans!
Something which I will always prefer than any English breakfast.
Old-school and so good! That \"q\" feel and that crisp exterior is just perfect!
This stall seems quite understated. The minced beancurd had a good bite, and soup light and not overly salty.
First meal back in Singapore! Just looks like a plate of messiness. Soon kueh and Peng kueh with lots of sweet black sauce. Just simple pleasures..
Very thick laksa gravy. Good and tasty too. Both deep fried and steamed Yong tau foo. Worth $4. 
This is purely a plate of blanched Shark Meat. Firm and sweet!
Have a blessed week ahead(: For the love of food, I\'m trying this Curry Rice that only opens from 7am-11am. Yes, spicy food first thing in the morning. The curry has a strong coconut taste and it\'s actually not of the spicy sort. Surprisingly light for breakfast and it\'s a refreshing way to start the day! 
However, I think the drawing factor is the huge portions. Look at the size of the Fish! Happy Lunching(:
Trying this for the first time, hope it doesn\'t disappoints(:
I chanced upon this rojak stall patronized by famous people like our President, Tony Tan, and I think also our PM, LHL. This plate of Rojak is overpriced IMHO. Too little youtiao, tau pok and actually asked for $4. Eat already not very song!
Dinner with @pohsio! Only regrets not trying the rojak and the oyster omelette isnt as nice as before :(
A lot of ingredients, meat and all. Great Singaporean meal at affordable price.
🔸🔸\n<br />So here I am at the infamous Whampoa market. A queue of about 8 or so people infront of me. I thought \"hey ... not too bad, wont have to wait long\". Hmm.... wrong! The guy behind me said to his wife \"queue like not moving leh. Like I am in the same spot forever\".\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Ooooh... my turn finally came after 25 mins. Said I to uncle : \"for two persons. Add taukwa and egg. 1 porridge and 1 rice\". Then uncle said to girl infront of me \"ting tau ler may yu. Sze yang order der. (Heard it? That is how you order for 2 persons.).\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />The gravy had a tasty smooth thick gooeyness.  Taukwa was yumz. The duck which is supposed to be the star element, fell short. Atad tough and chewy. Not quite the same standard as moons ago. But judging from the queue which is always forming, it is still quite popular among many.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />As I left the place, there was still a long queue. So, my parting words, hopefully the queue moves \"quackly\" and I will \"duck\" this if I visit Whampoa again.
It symbolises unity and reunion. On this day, I meet my naggy friend whom is as close as a sister, a family to me. 👯‍♀️ We had fish steamboat once again, this time round with red grouper fish! It has a very soft texture, melts in your mouth sort. And the soup was a lot more flavourful compare to the pomfret we had the other time. Drizzly night, hot steamboat to warm not only our tummies but our hearts as well.\n<br />#wintersolsticedinner #fishsteamboat #burpplesg #burpple #whampoamarket #redgrouper #tbf #sghawkerfood #sghawker #singaporefoodie #sgfood #chinesefood #singaporehawkerfood #singaporehawkercentre #goodforsharing #feedmefood2017

The stall usually opens very early in the morning as they serve the morning market crowd! Always expect a queue from this stall!
Ok, that\'s all.
Nommmzzzz
Roasted over the charcoal fires. Served with the quintessential savoury spicy peanut sauce. Complete with an undressed salad on the side. Who knew the deconstructed kebab would be such a hit? #sgfoodies #instafood #pork #hawkerpedia #hawkers #satay #food #foodgasm #foodporn #foodstagram #burpple #sgmakandiary #8dayseat #instafood

Juicy, succulent goodness!
I would always order the duck wings and the preserved vegetables when I\'m there 😍\n<br />#fishhead #fishheadsteamboat #hawkerfood #hawker
But you can disagree of course because I don\'t like sharing anyway. The chilli is potent and the ginger is intense. Ok, that\'s all.
At whampoa food centre. Closed on mon &amp; tues. 👍. #sgfood #sghawker #sginstafood #foodporn #duckrice #whampoa #burpple #hawkerpedia

How glorious. Ok, that\'s all.
But hor, I think a great skewer of satay should be three parts – meat, skin/fat, then meat again. That\'s just me lah. Ok, that\'s all.
Whampoa market $4 with batang fish. The stall is call the best lor mee.👍 #sgfood #sghawker #noodle #foodporn #burrple #lormee

For their pricing, not too bad.
And how others managed to finish their Laksa here without one too.
$4 small serving but pretty good
Really quite good. I like the charred crispy texture and the chili sauce is what superb. However for $4 the portion is pathetic.
Soft &amp; smooth soya beancurd!
Shiok !!
