Never been a big fan of cheesecakes, Patisserie G’s Lychee Rose Cheesecake ($8.50) may have me converted.
These kinda full breakfast is always overpriced and this one here is no exception.\n<br />$17.90++ for something we can easily prepare at home 😊 taste wise? Safe.
A little too sour for my liking, due to the choice of yogurt.\n<br />Means... Healthier choice isn\'t it? 😂\n<br />Prefer its neighbor Kith\'s version.
Poke mon cake is light yet refreshing, gives a fruity delight after taste, downing it with japanese x rosé tea ; tried their G spot cake, oozing with rich dark choc goodness !! Yumz will be back for another chillax sesh, ideal for friends, family and dating !!!
I have a different hobby and that\'s hunting for cakes 😻👆😋
Despite being $6, the cheapest among all the other desserts, this Apple crumble was pretty good! 👌🏼💫 Loved the crunchy outer layer and the spreading of cinnamon scent with my coffee ☕️ The crust was the best part though 💯 I\'m a hard crust lover, and this tart gave me the exact crunchiness I wanted ❗️❕ It was buttery and crispy and super smooth 👅 Would have loved it w vanilla ice cream 🍦💙
Was choosing my cake when I saw this and had to try it. Slightly tangy with chocolate bits for decoration… this us worth trying once for the Pokemon hype.\n<br />#PokemonGo #WorkHardAnywhere #PatisserieG #Dessert #Cake #SGcafe *
In comparison to the other astounding pastries I have had here, the Pina Colada Tart wasn\'t quite my cup of tea. It was mostly fine except that I\'d have preferred the pineapple filling to be less dry. But that\'s just me.
I met you too late. I thought you are a twin of the dark chocolate dome at Black Swan, until i finally met you yesterday. G spot is prettier on itself without the need of fancy plating, thanks to the shine. The inside had more crumble than black swan\'s version, and sweetness was well balanced. I\'ll be back 😊
The burger comes with coleslaw and a side of salad/crisps!! Both were really delicious 👍🏼
We tried 2 of their signature desserts as recommended by their shop assistant. 
Chocolate dome with the name - The G Spot, buttery croissant, citron tart and lychee rose cheese tart. Not too sweet and is really light! 
They\'ve an expanded menu of hot food, no doubt to stave off competition from the recently opened Kith.
Staff 1: Hello, good afternoon.\n<br />Me: Good afternoon, I would like to have some sandwich. \n<br />Staff 1: How about smoked salmon sourdough?\n<br />Me: Not really feel like having fish.\n<br />Staff 1: If you take beef, corned wagyu beef ciabatta?\n<br />Me: Hmm.... let me choose my dessert first. 😁 Lychee Rose Cheesecake &amp; Rose Osmanthus Tea pls. \n<br />Staff 1: Sure!
Hazelnut Ganache, Coffee Sponge, Chocolate Ganache. Ordered one more for myself because I just couldn\'t resist having one since I am already here. Really enjoyed this classic and elegant combination of flavours; the nutty hazelnut ganache, that bittersweet chocolate ganache and that light aroma of coffee running within. Definitely my pick for a sweet bite during a relaxing coffee session.
Lemon Mousse, Strawberry Balsamic Compote, Almond Sponge. Bought this as a surprise birthday cake for a friend\'s belated birthday celebration. Thought this was a pretty much a lose reiteration of a Strawberry Cheesecake without the cheesiness; the lemon mousse tasted a tad similar to the zinginess of a cheesecake without feeling too \"gao\" from cream cheese (because there isn\'t cheese in this one), while the tartness strawberry balsamic compote and the earthy and nutty almond sponge compliments the lemon mousse so well without being too contrasting nor overwhelming one another.
I will never learn that I don\'t like Black Forest. Look how pretty and innocent this thing is with its chocolate and cream. But then you take a bite and it\'s cherries and rum everywhere. I mean, I should have known because this IS Black Forest. It\'s something I\'ll never learn in life. Like trigonometry.
Price: 9SGD
Chocolate Cheese Mousse, Griottines, Chocolate Sponge with Kirsch. Chocolate cream cheese might seem to sound funky on the menu, but it\'s richness seem to make it less sickening than the usual fresh cream that is slathered on most Black Forest Cakes. This really went well with the chocolate sponge, lightly perfumed with alcohol so the chocolatey flavours don\'t get too overwhelming. Inside also lays a good amount of alcohol-soaked cherries that squirts an alluring alcoholic sweetness when chewed upon. Finished with a layer of mascarpone cheese and chocolate shavings on the outside, this is one Black Forest Cake where it feels really balanced, without being too sweet and chocolatey even after finishing the full portion.
Feeling so sleepy on this strange (and annoying) rainy and sunny, and rainy-and-sunny-again day that I need a booster! This exquisite Chocolate Caramel Tart that looks like Chocolate Planet with gold specks on the chocolate rings, perks up both my vision, taste bud and soul. I\'m now ready to proceed with the afternoon with my Mister.
Dark Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Meringue and Chocolate Hazelnut Praline Crunch encased in a high gloss dome. Good texture -- the mousse was very smooth and light accompanied with a little crunch, good mix of rich dark chocolate and sweet meringue. Definitely hit all the right notes of a g spot for chocolate enthusiasts like me.
Layers of Hazelnut Ganache, Coffee Sponge and Chocolate Ganache. A tad more on the sweeter side but it was still enjoyable. 
Can\'t stand it when cafes implement self service. Like as if coffee isn\'t hard enough to carry without spilling. It particularly sucks for people like me who work from cafes alone. I order the food and the girl is like \"Wait for your tray of cakes\" when it\'s obvious I\'m struggling to balance my bag with my laptop, and carrying my camera whilst attempting to juggle my wallet to pay. Yes so I do go to put down my stuff first after pointing out to the girl I obviously can\'t carry a tray at that point. But it also sucks that I have to choose a seat near the cashier (and listen to annoying people discuss their kids exams) because I don\'t want to leave my belongings unattended at the quieter more comfortable outside seating area.\n<br />Given the choice, yes I would prefer to pay more and just get that dammed food delivered to the table.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#PatisserieG #TeaTime
The G Spot (S$9) - it\'s made up of dark chocolate mousse, chocolate meringue, with chocolate hazelnut praline crunch as the base. \n<br />Love how the mousse is not overly sweet, perfectly complemented by the crunchy base. No wonder it\'s their signature dessert 👍👍
Anything with lemon keeps me happy though this is certainly not the most sour that I have found.
The pastries at Patisserie G have never disappointed me, and this one continues that perfect record.\n<br />While the lychee rose cheesecake was all velvety creaminess, the thin layer of lychee jelly on top provided the counterpoint with an aromatic, firmly springy loveliness. I liked that overall, the rose played a supporting role to the lychee; hovering in the background as the sweet fruit took centrestage. It could have veered into potpourri territory otherwise. 
It\'s interesting how Patisserie G always manages to pull off such daring combinations so elegantly and luxuriously. A layer of Lychee jelly sits atop the cheesecake, perfumed with the fruit\'s flavour with chunks of lychee flesh for the bite. It does not stop there though; the lychee bits go all the way into the cheesecake, which comes with a subtle Bandung-like flavour that makes it so refreshing amidst the rich and luscious cream cheese flavour of the mousse layer.
Clockwise from top: lychee rose cheese cake, earl grey berry cake, G spot

Cheesecake seems rather common these days but Cheesecake with alcohol infusion with Japanese Sake? Perhaps not. This interesting Cheesecake is spiked heavily with alcohol, with macerated fruits in between. Strong alcohol flavours with raisins felt really reminiscent to Rum and Raisins; pretty alluring. It\'s pretty wonderful considering you could taste the cheesecake despite how strong the alcohol flavours are, making this a rather indulgent dessert meant for alcohol-lovers
Gym friend texted me saying I must try the cakes and tarts from here. I have read about it and since I\'m on leave I made my way down.. Ordered the lychee cheesecake and coconut choux tart. Nice but not the best IMO. Also the price is quite steep. Pretty desserts but not outstanding in taste. I will continue with my search for better ones. 😉
Always get the flat white! 
Fell in love with choux after this trio with that sugar crust on top, definitely brings the whole taste to the next level. 
When I saw this, the first thought to cross my mind was how mundane a name for something so spectacular. Tasting it reconfirmed that thought because each strata of this creatively re-imagined tart was a star in its own right.\n<br />At the base was a thin, crunchy, salt-flecked chocolate pastry disc. Smooth, rich spheres of chocolate ganache stood neatly upon that. Balanced upon them was a second pastry disc, followed by a dome of salty caramel and lightest caramel cream. Together, they were like a Cirque du Soleil acrobatic act, an execution of perfection for maximum impact. My admiration of the tart\'s beauty lasted for all of two seconds before greed got the better of me.  
We are back for their devilious cakes!!! The strong aromatic coffee scent greeted us from far... These little cafe was relatively packed on weekends... Anyway their signature desserts such as G-Spot and Lemon Cheesecake are heavenly good!!
One word: Orgasmic 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Enjoyed the thickness of the white. Silky smooth. Good coffee!
Found it a little sweet even though it\'s supposed to be mainly dark chocolate. And it tastes SO much like the Guanaja cake from Rive Gauche!
However, that was not what I took home with me. \n<br />It was a cylindrical container holding 13 salted egg cookies. The cookies cost $15 which in my opinion is quite pricey, but I just cannot resist anything salted egg. This is pretty yummy but probably the first and last bottle I would buy.
Tart with a Malibu salted caramel filling, choux pastry, chantilly cream and topped off with a white chocolate. Was expecting a little more from this but the tart was too soggy and the sweet white chocolate threw off the taste balance of the whole dessert. Although I must say that though I usually don\'t like cream, the chantilly cream was quite nice.
Here\'s the science behind it =\n<br />Light caramel glaze + choux puffs + chantilly cream + sable biscuit base
$4.50 for a tiny cup but super rich and creamy.
If a cup of hot chocolate decided to go on a strict diet and hit the gym on a thrice weekly basis, this could pretty much be the \"After\". What an intense drink this is! Chiseled down to a lean, mean bare-bones machine of  rich, dark chocolate-ness, it was a shot of pure liquid bliss in petite size. 
The way flavours and textures are combined into this single exquisite pastry is genius. It begins with a buttery tart base filled with aromatic Malibu coconut liqueur creme brûlée, on which pools salted caramel sauce. A light and chewy choux puff, crowned with a cloud of Malibu chantilly cream floats atop that. Adding the finishing touch is a delicate disc of white chocolate. 
Patisserie G had been using blends from Liberty Coffee ever since their inception. The coffee was smooth, creamy and had a nutty taste profile; good for a relaxing cuppa over the variety of sweets they have to offer.
Puff pastry with luscious vanilla cream with burnt caramel over the top sitting atop a sable base. While the burnt caramel was crackling with each bite, we thought it quite overwhelmed the flavour of the light vanilla cream. That sable base did the trick though; injecting some buttery biscuit flavours into the dessert.
Chocolate lovers beware; this shiny ball of chocolate consists of not only chocolate but chocolate! Smooth chocolate ganache covers off the ball of thick chocolate mousse inside, without being either overly sweet not overly heaty. If there is any definition of sexiness in chocolate, this would well fit the description!
And hence the two 🐣 in a pot...or maybe more than that 😋 #patisserieg
[SCRAMBLED EGGS EN COCOTTE S$15 choice of croissant or brioche, orange juice] + [PORK SAUSAGE S$3] 👍👍👍👍
There is no doubt that each element and form of chocolate in this -- the silk, the cream, the cushion and the crisp -- simply meld together so seamlessly.\n<br />I do believe it is one of those rare desserts that has the ability to render you speechless with the first taste of it. For a few moments at least.
I should bring a pocket knife next time x Apologies for the mess I made.
Sorry for the unglamorous photo, but the inside is lemon, the outside is creamy cheesy cake and based with slightly bitter crust! Mixture of flavours!
Really good looking pastries there... wants to eat everything!
Am glad it was indeed up to expectations 😊 Hope to be back often for #libertycoffee
Love The G Spot. Dark chocolate - A mousse with chocolate meringue on a chocolate hazelnut praline crunch! The hot chocolate is by far the thickest I have ever tried! 
Dark chocolate with hazelnut bites. the taste is awesome. I\'m not a person fan of hazelnut but I had a great try for it. lovin it(:  
Small cozy cafe. The chocolate eclair and lemon cheesecake is so awesome. But the coffee is so-so. The ambience is really nice and the deco is modern. 
A place that specialized in pastries.. Ordered the the G-Spot - choco rich cake with the perfect sweetness and the lemon cheese cake which is not so cheesy! Nice! Perfect for pastries lovers!
Loved the salted caramel outer layer that was not too sweet and really good! could do with a bit less sponge though. 
Really appreciate that the barista created this kitty latte art on my latte for me, upon request! And their G Spot cake is to die for! My boyfriend who isn\'t a cake lover fell in love with it! Though it\'s a small cafe and cannot fit a lot of people, it\'s still cozy and spacious, and I feel very comfortable in this cafe!
A bad start ended up well with more coffee and desserts with the pretty lady. Happy Mid-week lovely people!
Blancheur - white chocolate mousse . raspberry coulis . crumble cookie base . white chocolate almonds coating .  Good combination of flavors.  The coulis was a little gelatinous and didn\'t come off the fork as easily as the other layers.
Miromel ($8.50) from Patisserie G. \n<br />Milk Chocolate Mousse with creamy caramel and chocolate sponge on an Oreo cookie base, with a touch of peanut butter.
Pretty desserts, may I devour you? (Though the macaroons are wonky flavoured! 🙅)
Blancheur ($9) White chocolate mousse with raspberry coulis, crumble based coated with white chocolate almond.
Morning grill: croissant on the girdle. Best breakfast ever...I kid. Just took one of these babies out of the oven and didn\'t had a plate nearby to put it on. But @willcookwilleat is right (as if that fella\'s ever wrong), this is one of the better croissants on the island. I can see the addiction. | #croissant #breakfast #food

A sweet saturday afternoon... finally get to try their saint honore!!! #dessert #yummy
The 3D Kittycino is now a permanent item on their menu and that means a guarantee whenever you go down for it. Coffee was good, the 3D kitty is just for your viewing (and photography) pleasure and that summed up to $10 for this experience. Barista didn\'t seem very friendly but was kind enough to allow me to take a video of him doing it.
Lemon cheese cake... this is heavenly yummy!!! Not too sweet n sour... #dessert #yummy #cake
Love this zesty piece! It\'s baked lemon cheesecake wrapped in a thin jelly layer on a dark biscuit base. I like how it\'s neither too sweet nor lemon-sourish, yet it\'s full of flavours! Best part of all - the biscuit base! Crunchy and buttery biscuit base complemented the cake so well that we just can\'t stop eating! Can\'t wait to try out the other cakes too😋
3D Coffee Art! Super cute! ^_^ 🐱
Exciting things are going on in the drinkable art world of coffee. If you don\'t like your coffee stirred, how about getting some cute animations to drink? 
Here\'s the SAINT HONORÉ from Patisserie G, one of the best seller, second to the G-spot. These were Choux puffs that are lightly glazed with caramel, and piped with chantilly cream, sitting on a sablé base. 
Assuredly artistic and inspiring, the local baristas has brought coffee art to an impressive new level. It\'s simply delightful to sip some of the art along with your coffee.
Yes, I\'m a citrus-lover (as you can see from my cake choices hmm) The citrus curd just melts in your mouth! This is slightly more tangy as compared to the lemon cheesecake (Good thing for a citrus lover like me heh) The tart, however, was slightly hard and crumbles quite easily. Still a good dessert, but the Lemon Cheesecake counterpart wins hands down!
With each cake like an artpiece, it takes a Burppler about 20 shots before willing to dig in. Each mouthful tastes like heaven, and every single detail is meticulously taken care of, contributing to the burst of sensations on the tongue. Don\'t miss their playfully named G-Spot chocolate cake, or the awesome-sounding Triomphe caramel cake. * Tip: If you specially request for the rare 3D latte art from the head barista, you might just be lucky enough to get it ;)
Flat white. Smooth. #burpple
Choux pastry in the form of a profiterole eclair! The cream was beautifully swirled within the pastry. The top part was my favorite! Sweet!
Cheesecake with a lemon custard core, rested on a crunchy guanaja glazed in a coat of vanilla pod infused gelatin, finished with a candied lemon peel.
One of the Winners in my desserts list! Lemon Cheesecake! 
ะOne of the best tiramisu I have eaten ะ not too sweet.. Love the rum in the center and the biscuity base :) been long day ..time to drift into dream land now 💤 gd nite
Sea salt caramel on left was yummeh, cheese on right not bad too
Small shop space and nothing fancy. \'The G Spot\' chocolate cake wasn\'t even close to hitting mine.
Small place, coffee isn\'t fantastic, and their \'The G Spot\' chocolate cake didn\'t even come close to hitting mine. :/
Latte art by the expert @geneliours .  This was for his friend though :)
Salted caramel mousse and hazelnut sponge. Yums. 
Mango Short Cake! 😋 Pleasantly light flavour and not too sweet! ❤
First decent coffee fix in days! Also trying out Patisserie G\'s new seasonal creation, the Easter Cake - homemade mango marmalade, cream cheese mousse and mousse-filled white chocolate Easter eggs.
The G - SPOT 📍 Dark chocolate mousse with chocolate meringue, sitting on a chocolate hazelnut praline crunch! 😋
Coffee was not bad here.. desserts too but a bit pricey. Had a macaron (not great texture but flavour was good), this little hazelnut cake was light and flavorful :)
Had an enjoyable lunch with Hsueh Yun, Food Editor of Straits Times. Really impressed by the emphasis she places on credibility and desire to give readers her most accurate opinions. She\'s really passionate for cooking and food. Going to read her Posh Nosh and Zhi Char columns on Sundays with added appreciation!
It\'s always a foodie\'s nightmare to be down with stomach flu, cause you can\'t eat proper food and you certainly have to give coffee a miss.  Thankfully it\'s over and I\'m back :) - salted caramel macaron, cherry and green tea macaron and a mini chocolate eclair
Simple and delightful.\n<br />So glad a cafe that serves a good matcha latte opens this early 😄
hearty breakfast!! super love the croissants
This was worth the calories... crispy battered fish + salted egg yolk sautéed mushrooms, and MORE salted egg yolk sauce 😆 I like how the salted egg yolk sauce doesn\'t just overwhelm everything else.

Walked past the other day and saw something new, so decided to drop by and try it. Playing with the usual suspects of Tropical desserts, this was a harmonious blend of coconut sponge, banana marmalade, mango passion mousse and Malibu Chantilly with a butter crumble base. Giving a refreshing, boozy flavour, the Malibu Chantilly sits above the banana marmalade which tones down the alcoholic bitterness of the Malibu Chantilly cream, while adding a little sweetness to the otherwise tart, yet subtly sweet Mango Passion mousse — a combination of the two fruits where mango helps to compensate a little of the passionfruit\'s tartness. The butter crumble base gives it a delightful crunch at the bottom, which rounds off the dessert pretty nicely.

I\'m in heaven!! 
At the bottom lay a thin, crunchy, salt-flecked chocolate pastry disc. Smooth, rich spheres of chocolate ganache stood neatly upon it. Balanced upon them was a second pastry disc, followed an oversized dome of salty caramel and lightest caramel cream. As a finishing touch, crisp dark chocolate encircled and topped that. My admiration lasted for all of two seconds before greed got the better of me. \n<br />#veronicaphuaeats #burpple #PatisserieG #tart #dessert #pastry #sgcafe #cafesg #instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #burppletastemaker

Not so appealing in its looks, the Canele is one of the more underrated items here at Patisserie G. It\'s one of the least bitter ones I ever had, yet the exterior was crusty and inside was sweet enough and chewy with a Kueh-like consistency.

Cake session today 🍰☕️
Requested for a unique latte art and the barista gave me a little bunny! Praying hard that I\'ll be lucky enough to get a 3D one from the Latte Art Master next time! (Though I heard they don\'t do it anymore 😟) Nevertheless, this is still one of my favourite Cafes of all time! Coffee was strong enough but doesn\'t leave an unpleasant bitter aftertaste! Very aromatic beans from Liberty Coffee :)

Ho Pat G, you got my caption so awkward.
Salted, slightly burnt caramel mousse, with layers of hazelnut sponge. Love it\'s not too sweet, but very velvety mousse. Unlike anothers.
Love their bite/ texture and honey-glazed surface. They\'re perfectly shaped almost looked like an \"alien-in-a-capsule\" (dunno why but I have this impression of caneles). This is more moist on the inside than I would like them to be.
one of the best cheesecakes ive ever had
Pre-Gym snack - Marron D\'Orange - Chestnut cream, orange jelly, chestnut orange sponge, and crumble base.  With the usual coffee fix of course.
gotta go there and try the dainty desserts soon!
Panda brew! #food
