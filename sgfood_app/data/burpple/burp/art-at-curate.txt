The front piece was served with  a mint and coriander emulsion and the rest of the crab with pear, bamboo shoot and Chilli.
This is no longer in the new menu but if you\'d like to try it, I\'d suggest that you make a request when you make your reservations. This is my second time having it and it still WOWs me.
Well, not for long. Chef Halat came by and shaved a generous portion of black Australian truffles on it. Again, we didn\'t realise that the red onion was holding all that oxtail together till our first bite. Loved the surprise.
This was amazing! The ingredients all just came together in such perfect harmony. I didn\'t even need the toasted brioche for this as I was just happy to tuck in the parfait as is.
This was such a great last snack as once you bite into the sphere, it just pops in your mouth and clears your palate for the courses to come.
Chef Halat\'s idea of bringing the beach to his diners. Well, it sure brought smiles to our faces and silence as we bite into these delectable pieces of tuna sashimi with cashew nuts wrapped in nori. What a clever play of ingredients and I love the plating.
This was one delectable snack. Really enjoyed it and call me biased but I do love Kalamata olives.
This #eggporn is especially gorgeous and delicious to boot. Super fluffy, the \"Soufflated Egg\" by @chefhalat.restaurantcurate is blanketed in truffle \"caviar\" and sits in a pool of basil flavoured sauce. \n<br />If you wish to have this, and I recommend you do, please note you should inform the restaurant ahead. Preferably when making reservations as it is actually not listed in their menu.
We were all blown away by the foie gras course during last night\'s dinner at Curate.\n<br />What electrifying deliciousness it delivered with the coming together of an extraordinarily smooth goose liver, raw minced langoustine, Japanese sancho pepper and a sweeter-rather-than-sour form of passionfruit. \n<br />This dish, for me, is a great representation of Chef Benjamin Halat\'s cuisine which is exciting as it\'s full of fresh ideas that are well followed through in the execution by him and his team.
Pine nuts, pumpkin and raspberry jelly. I loved the pumpkin best and we were all surprised it was served cold! Yummy!
Doenjang creme br√ªl√©e, Ganjang pecan and Gochujang powder served with puff grains and vanilla ice cream. This was so good! The flavours and textures all came together. Salty, savoury, spicy and sweet. No surprises as this is Mingles\' signature dessert, comprising the three essential jangs in Korean cuisine.
The fish was slowcooked in a special stock made with ganjang, fennel and water parsley. This was really yummy as the sauce complemented this oily fish well.
Porridge cooked with 24 hour cold brewed anchovy stock, abalone and matsusake mushrooms. This was so delicious, nothing like what we imagined it to be. I savoured every mouthful of it, wishing it would never end or that I could have more.
This was inspired by the Korean seafood Cho-Hoe (sashimi with spicy, sour and cold soup). It\'s a mixture of blanched scallops with Jangajji (Korean fermented vegetable pickles), Korean Bottarga and local vegetables with a light touch of Makgeolli (Korean fermented rice wine) vinegar. So delicate and lovely balance of flavours.
The famous Mingles egg dish is served here in a nest shaped bowl. Chorizo and cabbage marinated in Sancho pepper resting on soft boiled egg yolk, filled with cauliflower and egg white foam, this was so yummy! Enjoyed every mouthful of it and I wanted more!
Our first starter for our lunch at Mingles at Art at Curate was mind blowing! Pretty as a painting, it was even more amazing on the palate. This set the tone for our entire lunch.
We really enjoyed this 100 gourmet lunch and look forward to coming back to Curate soon for yet another four hands meal. It was really nice to meet both @chefhalat.restaurantcurate and @the_modernchef. Chef Elizabeth, all the best with your new restaurant in London and I hope to visit it when I make a trip there.
When this was served, we all looked at it and wondered how it would taste. Then as each of us dug into our individual portions, our party of 8 was silent and all that could be heard are murmurs of hmmm... in appreciation of this divine creation by the Chef Elizabeth.
This course by @chefhalat.restaurantcurate totally blew us away. It was so unbelievably good. There\'s good news for those who missed the 100 gourmet dinners. You can still sample this amazing course on the testing menu in Curate as it\'s one of Chef Benjamin\'s signature dishes. Yay!
Chef Elizabeth Allen who is half Singaporean created a dish which reminded her of her childhood flavours. The seasoning for this was amazing. I love how she played with memories from childhood for this.
The perfect palate cleanser
We were each given this as a snack to bring home. I had almost forgotten about it until @veronicaphua mentioned that her husband really enjoyed it.\n<br />*\n<br />Curate\'s version of the traditional crunch rice snack in South Korea was a delightful combination of savoury sesame seaweed with sweet (but not overly so) milky chocolate and crunchy popped rice.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
@chefhalat.restaurantcurate smoked tobacco leaves on the rice ash to make it smell authentic.

When it was first served, I had my reservations as it reminded me of the tart Granny Smith apples we had in the UK.\n<br />*\n<br />While it still had a hint of tartness, the apples were actually made of ice cream!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Mashed and reconstructed sweet corn and sweet potato with caramel pop corn ice cream, pop corn crumble and rambutan honey. Such an amazing combination of tastes and textures!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The combination of savoury brie cheese with potato skin and chorizo drizzled with sweet rambutan honey was truly amazing!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Topped with truffle caviar and spinach.

With a purple flower perched right on top. So pretty!\n<br />*\n<br />We were still trying to figure what the flower was when @chefhalat.restaurantcurate told us it was porridge flower from Nederlands. It had an interesting garlicky flavour.\n<br />*\n<br />We were even more thrilled when Chef Benjamin came round to shave the Australian black truffle on top. üòãüòã\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Topped with langoustine tartare, passion fruit, sancho pepper and pecan nut, the foie gras come across as being decadent but not overly rich. The combination worked really well.\n<br />*\n<br />@sk_food_and_travel l, who is seldom generous nor expressive with his compliments, was full of praise for this dish!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #restaurantcurate #rwscurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The delicate ball immediately exploded in my mouth.

@chefhalat.restaurantcurate said he brought the beach to the table, which he did with tuna sashimi and cashew nut wrapped in nori (seaweed). I couldn\'t really taste any of the ingredients individually. All I know is that it tasted very good as a whole üòã.\n<br />*\n<br /> #hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #restaurantcurate #rwscurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The last time we were here at Curate, we were served lemon oil jelly. I prefer this olive oil version - more savoury üòä and the chilli gave it a certain zing.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwsdining #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Chef @chefhalat.restaurantcurate spent 3 years at Mandarin Grill (Mandarin Oriental) in KL. It was therefore no surprise at all that his curry puff was very authentic. This was despite a reduction in spiciness to suit the international palate. Loved the presentation!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #curaterestaurant #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
We all enjoyed ourselves so much that we committed a faux pas. Once which should not be disclosed.
Marinated in champagne for an hour and served with sesame emulsion. A good start to the meal üòä.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was interesting! The corn is not what it seems to be. It\'s reconstructed. So brilliant. Again the element of surprise!
Here it\'s served with smoked bone marrow, chanterelles and tomatoes.
I love savoury snacks and this was one delectable bite!
This went well with the abalone porridge.
This was light, slightly tangy yet sweet but not overly so. My favourite dish of the night!\n<br />*\n<br />I love how Chef Elizabeth @the_modernchef kept this dish so light and refreshing.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #100gourmet #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Chef Benjamin @chefhalat.restaurantcurate prepared the outer layer of egg white like a souffl√© üòç. The light and fluffy texture of the egg white souffl√© with a creamy egg yolk centre and truffle caviar on top was just the perfect combination!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #100gourmet #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious\n<br />@the_modernchef @rwsdining @100gourmet @blueskiescottonclouds @sk_food_and_travel @ursulalean @winwaha @nomadicexpat @yuhmeei @hsiuyi168
I love how Chef Elizabeth @the_modernchef, who was born in Singapore, incorporates bold Asian flavours into her dishes. This dish reminded her of mamee chicken noodle, a very popular snack she grew up with. Obviously the mamee snack which I remember from my childhood was nowhere as refined as this üòÇ.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_curate #rwscurate #restaurantcurate #100gourmet #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Our 100 gourmet lunch began with lemon oil jelly and chorizo oil madeleine.

@chefhalat.restaurantcurate used a Japanese method to age the beef and this main course was really delicious! We really enjoyed every bite.
Delicious and left us wanting more.
The texture and the flavours were simply amazing. As @nomadicexpat says, we can never go back to our normal breakfast eggs after this. @chefhalat.restaurantcurate is a genius!
