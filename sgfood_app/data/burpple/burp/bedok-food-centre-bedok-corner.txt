Best fried prawn noodle ever. Sad thing is article wrote Uncle is getting old and might retire.
Have to say, their thick savory gravy is not meant for the faint hearted! Salty and sweet at the same time, it really help the chicken to taste the same everytime!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#bedokcorner#tff#bonelesschicken#tongfongfatt#hainanesechickenrice#chicken#foodie#eatsg#delicious#chickenrice#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#8dayseatout#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
To my surprise, it sells plenty of other stuff despite its name.. This rice feels a lot like Briyani. Basmati rice with slightly sweet aroma. Have to be frank, didn\'t think much of it till I have the first bite. It was good! Maybe think of it like a sweet version of a Briyani. \n<br />Chicken thigh makes a nice accompaniment and egg which I paid extra is a must for any Nasi goreng meal!😛\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#nasigoreng#ayampenyet#nasigorengtomato#bedokcorner#briyani#cafesg#localdelights#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending

The noodles and shredded chicken tasted not bad and it also comes with a begedil that didn\'t turn mushy even when soaked in the soup!
It comes with sour cream and another sauce that goes well with the mandi rice, which was light yet fragrant!
The tofu and tempeh were rather average.
😁😁😁
Such a waste that the Cheng tng was all sold out, if not, it would complete my meal!
