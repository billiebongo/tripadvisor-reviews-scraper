Bibimbap with just the right amount of spicyness! Leave it as it is for a few minutes for that crusty cripsy rice from the hot stone bowl, would\'ve preferred more veggies but other than that 8/10! ($9.90)
Soy bean paste stew vegetarian soup with purple rice. Do you know the purple rice is actually Korean Black glutinous rice? 🍚🍚🍚 so pretty! 🇰🇷🍴 #thebonelesskitchen #无骨厨房 #korean #vegetarian #commerzeatirving #sgrestaurants #meatless #koreanfood
