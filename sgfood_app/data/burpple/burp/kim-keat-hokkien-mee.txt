$10 for a bowl that\'s meant to be shared for two. Bubbling hot when served, it\'s really shiok when eaten on a cold rainy day. Loved how the broth was flavourful and not too thick or salty! The clams inside were a pleasant surprise as well. However, I found the crispy pork lard, and the meat itself, a tad too overcooked and dry. I found the portion to be a little too small for the price as well. This kind of claypot hokkien mee is different from the usual \"wet\" hokkien mee we eat, but I think I would go for the latter (lorong 1 tian tian lai, I\'m coming soon!) Wouldn\'t specially come down for their hokkien mee again, I\'d rather eat the caifan next door at Ocean Curry Fish Head!
Wouldn\'t find myself anywhere near Braddell if it wasn\'t this. Must we really travel there for hokkien mee? Oh yes, it is means your dish is serve in claypot bubbling, piping hot and sizzling. We ordered a two person portion($10), you will find your usual prawns and sotongs(duhhh!) and also clams which I think totally brings the unami of this dish to a whole new level. The chilli was so addictive i found myself eating it alone but also totally complements the dish. One thing though, the crispy pork lard was too dry. Thats like probably the only fault I could find. If you like claypot dishes, you should try this. Like hokkien mee this stall is it. Like both? What are you waiting for? You need to try this!
Have been hearing about this dish and have seen it pop up on my IG from time to time. üòã Finally managed to give it a try at about 8pm on a weekend (Sunday though) and surprisingly there was no queue ahead of us. Ordered the $10 version, and a pot of hot soupy goodness was served quickly. Noodles were soaked in the flavourful soup and the small clams were a nice surprise from the usual. Only downside was that the serving size was slightly smaller than expected and I felt like I could do with another few more spoons of the yellow goodness. Other than that do give this a try! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª
The claypot hokkien mee is at $10 for 2 persons. The noodle was nice and yummy. It includes clams, prawns, roasted meat and squid. It has a unqiue claypot taste to it which I may come back for. However, I feel that more noodle should be given as it didn\'t feel fulfilling enough. \n<br />Compared to the normal non claypot hokkien mee at the same stall, this is much more unqiue and less salty, probably due to the sweetest of the clams. \n<br />Do give this a try((:
The hokkien mee was not too bad and the roast meat was just awesome! Despite it was just a hokkien mee in clay pot, it did have an unique taste after all. But as we have to wait for around 30 minutes in spite of being there even before the store opens, I would not really say that you should give it a try if you do not have that much patience. For the food, I would give it a 7.5/10 for the presentation, 8.5/10 for the taste, and because the service isn\'t too good, I would give it a 5/10 for service. Overall it\'ll be a 7/10 so yeah if you have the free time to just wait, do give it a try! ;) 
Claypot hokkien mee for 2 ($10) sizzling goodness of hokkien mee !  TGIF Y\'ALL
Thick rich broth &amp; tasty noodles! $10 portion can be shared with 3 small eaters! Quite worth a trip if you are around the corner.. Didn\'t wait too long but remember to get the utensils yourself..
Walkable from braddell mrt 8-10mins walk. Didnt have to wait long before we got our $10 portion of hokkien mee in a claypot for 2!! Lime clams pork mee prawns sotong was good! Chilli was a little spicy for us. Would come back to try their hokkien  mee on white leaf!
Portion for 3.
The soup dry very fast. The menu are quite confusing as it also has the normal hokkien mee. Taste like normal hokkien mee with additional fried roasted pork meat. Overall is 2/5 rating for me.
Taste like normal hokkien mee, but worth a try nevertheless! They do sell normal hokkien mee served on opeh leaf, but didn\'t cross our mind to try it too. Ingredients include: fresh big prawns, lala, roast pork and pork lard üòç. | $10 for 2 pax | $20 for 4 pax
First time for all 3 of us ü§ó There are clams buried under all that gooey noodles and the roasted pork belly ( sio bak ) is the highlight of this  Á¶èÂª∫Èù¢. We didn\'t had to wait long as we called to \" reserve\" one :) Yes we managed to wiped it all out ..thanks to the only guy around that night lol !
yummy! \n<br />they gave us a larger serving even though we ordered the 10dollars one! how nice! must be a lucky day
If you like clam, roasted pork belly and claypot, this is a Hokkien Mee you will enjoy. The broth and chili is not the best but the combination of the ingredient makes it right. Worth the try.
Smoky hot claypot Hokkien Mee! $5/pax or portion. Ingredients are fresh also includes clams!
Been wanting to eat the claypot Hokkien Mee for a long time.
Still seem to be a craze recently although it has been around for a while. The pot was brimming with ingredients and was still sizzling when it arrived. The mee was the super wet kind that I like and the chilli added a bit of kick to it. Taste wise, nothing too fascinating but still good. Eat when you are in the vicinity, don\'t travel specially for it, imo. #burpple
The Hokkien Mee did not have the wok hei that the opeh leaf version had. Still, rather enjoyable as the pork lard makes it fragrant. Lots of fresh seafood but I still think $20 is a bit steep. Tian Tian Lai still trumps this in all aspects. 
The much-raved about claymore hokkien mee that has got everyone salivating when looking at their phones. While it seemed a little pricey, the generous ingredients given made up for it. The lard and siobak was super shiok, giving the dish a nice crispy bite. If you let the dish rest for a while, the noodles will soak up more of that awesome gravy. But maybe due to the hype, it was a little underwhelming. Nevertheless, still excellent to have, especially on a cold rainy day. 
And our legacy.
This time with delicious gooey seafood hokkien mee topped with crisp roast pork. Perfect for rainy days‚Ä¶
Many have came and conquered, if you haven\'t, I recommend you to make a trip down one day.
Our last &amp; final stop was to have the famous Kim Keat Hokkien Mee (S$15) which easily feeds about 2-3pax, depending on how hungry you are! \n<br />When the claypot arrived, all we saw was massive waves of steam and listened to the bubbling of the gravy. üòå Digging right into the mixture of yellow mee, thick beehoon, prawns, sotong, clams topped with fried three-layer pork, which soaked up ALL the gravy, it was bliss right at that moment. \n<br />This is a must try &amp; it\'s happily tucked at the corner of a coffee shop. You will know whether you\'re at the right coffee shop based on the number of the tables that have claypots on it &amp; people slurping their noodles away. \n<br />Now you know what to get for lunch? üòè
Served super hot, bubbling and steamy - brimming with seafood flavours and with umami flavours from the crispy pork belly.
Served simmering hot in a claypot. A real treat seeing the bubbling gravy! Bits of pork lard &amp; pieces of roasted pork belly topped off this mouth-watering dish. Local food done right!
Not bad but found it overrated. Would rate it 6.5/10. $12-15 for a 2 pax portion. Wouldn\'t go back, find it not worth the trouble of the location.
I find the man behind this pot of hokkien mee more delectable than the noodle itself. 
üç¥ Was pretty decent with crispy roast pork and fresh seafoodüòä but felt its overhyped! Not reli the best ive tried in life and not reli worth the 40mins waiting timeüòê Cool style of serving it in a claypot tho.
4 of us ordered the $15 portion of Hokkien mee and was disappointed. The amount is even lesser than the $10 I\'ve ordered last year. Last year, for $10 you get a full claypot, but now you don\'t even get a full clay pot. It is also not as tasty as last time. The claypot will come sizzling and the noodles is supposed to absorb the gravy after a while. But it was still watery after some time. Probably better if I buy my own sio bak and add to tian tian lai hokkien mee instead..
Finally got to try the famous kimkeat Claypot Hokkien Mee during store visits! Just look at that whole pot of noodles! Bubbling hot when served, the Claypot version comes with additional Sio ba and clams, as compared to the normal Hokkien Mee. Asked my colleagues if the claypot version tastes different from the normal version and their answer was a flat \'no\'. I also found the portion slightly small for $15- I think with this price, you can get a bigger portion of similar quality elsewhere. That said, the broth is rich and chilli paste is shiok. 
I like it for the fact that there are more thick bee hoon than yellow noodles &amp; they are very generous with the broth. I like my hokkien mee with lots of zhup (broth). The rich prawn broth made up for the lack of wok hei but I wished the sambal was spicier. Maybe balachan would be better.
on another note, leaving for aussie with a brand new pokadot casing c/o @monocozzi.
Not even nice. Dont waste time queueing  for hours is not worth the wait. The broth wasn\'t even rich and it doesnt have the rich hokkiean mee taste. If your\'ll have eaten the real authentic hokkiean mee then your\'ll would know why this hokkiean mee is not up to standard.
Actually I used to come to this kopitiam quite often, never realised the stall was here. \n<br />Fans of ‚Äôzup zup‚Äô variants of Hokkien Mee will take pleasure in Kim Keat‚Äôs version, as you scoop the somewhat salty sauce (some say overly salty) at the bottom to pour over the noodles.
This is my answer to everyone. Many Food Blogger &amp; Even HungryGoWhere rated 5 stars. \n<br />I dun find it any surprise. The only thing attract me is the claypot that keep the noodle piping hot. I can\"t believe that when i ate a mouthful of the noodle i really feel thirsty look like the noodle soaked too much of the broth. If anyone wanna try  pls go head but let me warns u guys u will feel so thirsty after eating the noodle don\"t say i nv inform u guys . The price for the claypot noodle is frm $10 to $30.\n<br />Name: Kim Keat  Hokkien Mee\n<br />Address:Blk 92 Toa Payoh Lor 4 #01-264 Singapore 310092\n<br />Operating Hours:1100-2130hrs\n<br />Closed on Tuesdays
Finally got to try this famous Sotong Mee (yes, that\'s how some refers to this, as Hokkien Mee is usually fried in black/sweet sauce) within my electoral constituency (Oops, still in GE mood). Took the option for the noodles to be served on the Opeh leaf instead of the popular claypot as I generally prefers the noodle to be less wet. The claypot version looks too soupy to be nice. Like the rich stock used and the texture of the noodle and bee hoon, which totally absorbed the flavours but without becoming mashy. The \"hae-bee\" (dried shrimp) style chilli is unique for Sotong Mee. Will certainly be back. 
Claypot Hokkien Mee\n<br />Bubbly goodness! Not the best hokkien mee but definitely above average
Thanks to someone else\'s post on burpple, I learnt that we could call to \"reserve\" in advance so there was no agonizing wait! The generosity and variety of ingredients made this $15 portion well worth the money, and though this was probably meant to feed 3 people, my boyfriend and I had no issue polishing off the entire pot by ourselves. I was especially hooked on those plump juicy clams and tasty strips of roasted pork belly. I\'d definitely have this again the next time I happen to be in toa payoh!
Finally tried this! Told us there\'s an hour queue but arrived within 30min. Nothing can scare me off! Enjoyed the fried lard and sliced pork, coupled with the prawns and juicy goodness. The flavor and wok hei are enjoyable, but felt that the servings are a little small for $15.
Every plate meticulously dished out by a single man, known for this good natured attitude, who also happens to be an exconvict. Always happy to see the community giving others a second chance.
Definitely don\'t skimp on ingredients here. Comes with Sio bak, laba and the works. Be prepared for an hour long wait though!

Finally tasted it. Not bad. But remember to make reservations in advance to avoid getting disappointed. #tingzieeats #burpple @leenzsim
The most impressive aspect of the dish is the perfect amount of smokey wok-hei flavour that had been infused into the noodles and the fat juicy prawns, courtesy of the chef\'s skills at the ladles; it will hit you with all the right notes. Spiked with plenty fried lard bits and some sio-bak, the pork added a deeper, complex character to the thick and simmering sweet stock, something that is sorely lacking in many mediocre hokkien mees. I had initially thought there was too much stock, but this seemed to be a deliberate decision so the noodles will not be too dry. Alas, the strength of the dish also became its own downfall; perhaps being overzealous with the frying, the squid was definitely overcooked (almost felt as if it had boiled in the stock) and did not manage to retain any flavour. More fried eggs would also be wonderful. Chilli was piquant, just enough to not overpower the dish. The hour of wait was certainly quite painful, but worth a try if you\'re in the area!
The dish that started it all... I\'m not a fan of the Singapore version of Hokkien mee but one look at that and I knew it was going to be awesome. Remember to specify that you want the claypot version (prices start from $10) as the default is regular Hokkien mee without the roasted pork!
unlike many others, you\'ll find clams and pieces of delicious roasted pork accompanying your prawns, squids with the noodles and broth.
Hokkien Mee served simmering in a tasty seafood broth served in a Claypot. Full of flavour and fresh seafood. Spied a mussel or two in the mix too! So good we had seconds. 
Travelled all the way here for this noodles in a rich pork &amp; prawn broth w/ fried sio ba, pork lard, clams, sotong &amp; prawns! So good!  $10 n\' it filled the happy tummy for 2! 
Will travel for food. So here I am because I like soupy ones and I regretted because I should have ordered a larger portion instead of the $10 claypot! It was served piping hot, bubbling but so tasty I didn\'t mind having it despite the hot day. Pretty good pork &amp; prawn stock, no wokhei though. And my happiness (and guilt) when I bit into the crispy lard thinking it was roasted pork. Prawn was succulent. Loved the dish overall, only gripe was meat\'s a little dry.
Probably my favourite hawker dish next to laksa, though I always leave the oysters behind. I like how the uncle here fries the egg until it\'s dark and golden-brown and crispy ‚Äì in perfect contrast to the meltingly soft pieces of starch it blankets.
Can\'t express just how satisfying it was to slurp down those soft noodles ensconced in a rich pork and prawn stock that\'s brimming with wok hei.
$4 and burnt on every side and it\'s super crispy and fluffy on the inside! The food was prepared super quick! And I was very happy with the quality! 
Tried this monster Hokkien Mee last year and decided to try it again after it was featured in one of the latest Burpple guides. As I commented in my previous post, I feel that Tian Tian Lai trumps this place. Nonetheless, Kim Keat Hokkien Mee has its plus points. I really really love the siew yoke / xio ba (whatever you would call it), it is not only crispy, but fried to golden brown such that the pork flavour soaks into the meat. That is probably the best thing of this dish. The Hokkien Mee leans towards the soupy side and the soup was quite tasty, which was probably added by the use of the claypot. Unfortunately, the noodles didn\'t absorb the flavour of the soup and the wok hei and tasted rather bland. To help, I used the chili to add more flavour to the noodles. The seafood used was fresh, as the prawn was able to slide off its shell with minimal effort. Ultimately, I would say that its worth a try, especially for the xio ba. The only downside is that this place is slighly ulu; you can only get there by bus 235, or take a long stroll from Braddell MRT.
One of the best Hokkien Mee I\'ve eaten. It\'s served in a clay pot. I really love the juicy pork which gives a little bit of salty-ness to the broth. For $10 (2-3pax) I\'d say it\'s pretty worth it
Kim Keat\'s specialty Claypot Hokkien Mee ($10) comes steaming hot, and swimming in a thick, bubbling, flavourful broth with prawns and squid. Making it even more irresistible, strips of crispy fried pork belly sit gently on top, quietly beckoning you. The portion is enough for 2-3 pax, so bring a few friends along and dig in! Quoting Tastemaker Shurong Lo, \'As you tuck into the yummy noodles, you can taste the smoky wok hei mixed with the prawn broth that brings the Hokkien mee to a whole new level. Over time, all broth will be sucked into the noodles making them even more flavorful! Slurp!\' You may also opt for the regular Hokkien mee on an opeh leaf instead.
Claypot Sio Bak Hokkien Mee ($10)\n<br />Huge serving, suitable for 2-3 paxs.\n<br />Chunky juicy roasted pork, big prawns, lala and flavourful noodles in pipping hot claypot. Served with tasty chili sauce.\n<br />Need to wait quite awhile cos it\'s a one man show cos the uncle needs to cook cum take order cum serve.
This stall serves the normal Hokkien mee on opeh leaf as well as the very photogenic claypot version. I liked the chilli which was very dry (not oily) but the claypot Hokkien mee I found to be average with no taste of prawn stock. The pork was deep fried which looked great in pictures due to the color contrast, but in reality was way too dry. Still prefer the usual stir fried version!
I\'m not usually a fan of hokkien mee, but this pot of goodness is awesome! Noodles fried in thick, flavorful seafood gravy and topped with crispy roasted pork and pork lard, it\'s one of the better ones I\'ve tried. $10 portion is good for 3,  2 if you\'re really hungry; they\'re also pretty generous with the prawns and roasted pork! 
Unlike the usual plate of hokkien mee but in a claypot, with lots of prawn, squid and roasted pork.
I love it as its quite moist and $10 is just nice for 2 person!
I love it as its quite moist and $10 is just nice for 2 person!
Was expecting it to be too watery and tasteless but it was so damn good! Full of wok hei flavour as well as a tinge of sweetness from the prawns. You can choose to either add oysters of deep fried roasted pork to your hokkien mee too
Didn\'t expect it to be so delicious, I love the roast pork added in with fresh prawns, also clams are added in like a kinder surprise hahaha
Located just 5 minute walk away from balestier MRT is this humble claypot Mee coffee shop. For $10 it\'s enough for 2-3pax even though the uncle will recommend a party of 3 to get a $15 portion but Hey! You can also get oyster omelette to share too which is super crispy and is probably one of the best oyster omelette I have ever had! The prawn Mee is very flavourful and you can taste the wok Hei! There\'s quite a number of prawns and sotongs too.
Sometimes you come across a dish that makes perfect sense and makes you wonder why haven\'t anyone tried this before. This is one of those. The hokkien mee arrives in a steaming hot mess with the broth bubbling merrily away. As you tuck into the yummy noodles, you can taste the smoky wok hei mixed with the prawn broth that brings the hokkien mee to a whole new level. Over time, all broth will be sucked into the noodles making them even more flavorful! Slurp! 
Just when I thought Hokkien Mee with Siok Ba coupled with a good sambal chilli is almost non-existent in today\'s modern Singapore, I stumbled upon this stall that serves Claypot Hokkien Mee with oysters and topped with generous amount of crispy Siok Ba accompanied with a good prawn paste sambal chilli (not belachan)! The mix of flavors - saltiness from crispy Siok Ba, spiciness from the sambal (we had heaps as it lacked the kick) and sourness from the many limes nailed it. This pot of gooey goodness cost $10, serves 2-3 is simply irresistible!
Good hokkien mee with lots of wonderful deep fried bits of lards. Noodles had a prominent wok hei taste. Prawns were fresh and succulent! Soaked with gravy for you to slurp up the gooey seafood goodness. Only thing was the Nasi lemak like chilli, didn\'t bring much to the dish. The $8 portion for 2 people comes with the opeh leaf. 
Recommended by ieatishootipost, decided to check it out. Would say that this is one of the good fried hokkien prawn noodles!
You need to order the $5 portion for that. Gonna order that next time and I‚Äôll know if I prefer this to the Serangoon Road Hokkien mee.
Wet hokkien mee with many pieces of sio bak, prawn and sotong. But I feel it\'s not worthy for $10 for 2.
Unlike your usual plate of hokkien mee - but in a clay pot. Flavorful prawn taste with roasted pork. A pot for 2 pax at $10!
7 of us shared the biggest portion available ($30). The salty Sio Bak complements the rich hokkien mee. Definitely worthy a revisit!
Put hokkien mee in a claypot and add sio bak. Simply irresistible. When my friend and I saw it, we thought we won\'t be able to finish it(we are two small sized girls). Before we knew it... We finished the whole pot haha!
Nice!
It was immensely decadent: The broth had a strong sweet pork aroma, and they were particularly generous with the seafood and crispy roast pork. It was also quite ingenious of them to add small bits of pork lard to the dish, which added a salty, albeit sinful crunch to each bite.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodporn #tslmakan #singaporeinsiders #claypot #8dayseat #like4like #visitsingapore #buzzfeast #foodpornsg #sgfoodies #f52grams #whati8today #foodstagram #foodgasm #sgfoodie #feedfeed #sgfoodtrend #followforfollow #buzzfeast #yahoofood #eeeeeats #hawkers #foodpornmalaysia #igersmalaysia #foodiegram #flatlay #exploremalaysia #like4follow #burpple
Within the pot was a wonderful confluence of flavours: clams, medium-sized prawns, crispy pork slices, moist noodles. Everything was daubed amply with sweet seafood broth.

Yummeh~
This variant is more towards the starchy zhup version. Noodles had a charred and toasty fragrance; the gravy was gao enough to cling onto the noodles without being too jelak. Remember to squeeze the lime for some tang! Definitely one of the better Hokkien Mees around. Reasonably priced at $10, enough for 2 pax!\n<br />.\n<br />Really inspiring to learn that the owner was an ex-convict, who later turned over a new leaf and earned name for himself with this awesome dish.\n<br />.\n<br />At the same kopitiam, there\'s great sour and savoury curry snapper too at Ocean Curry Fish Head.

The sio bak (roasted pork) was a tad dry. The trick is to dip it in the noodle and savor together with the saucy soft noodles.

hokkien mee to be exact. It came bubbling away with full hot steam. Only 2 prawns, some squid but the star ingredient is the crispy sio bak, crispy and crackling. Dont forget the sambal chilli.

Nevertheless it was still pretty decent! I guess I also prefer my hokkien mee less wet.. And this is anything but dry! \n<br />#foodporn #hawkerfood
How can anyone resist?

But at least I enjoyed eating this, I loved it that it was served bubbling hot and also the different types of seafood in it making the gravy really sweet.
Was pretty good, didn\'t have to wait long too.  #burpple

Would always ordered the Hokkien mee in Opeh leaf ($8) here. Taste wise seems pretty much the same between the two just that the  claypot version have more of the flavourful stock.. #dinner #chinesefood #hawker #noodles #instagood #foodlover #vscofood #onthetable #whati8today #food #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodporn #foodpornography #getinmybelly #sgfood #sgigfoodies #singaporefood #foodforfoodies #foodstagram #lifeisdeliciousinsingapore #happytummy #foodphotography #foodpics #icapturefood #foodstamping #openricesg #burpple
Those bubbling goodness... Yums! 
Piping hot!
I think the sio baah is what makes it so yummeh. Haha! #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #takemymoney
This very wet soupy one brings hokkien mee to another level. The noodles is soaked and cooked with prawns, squid, shiobak and clams.

Very good wok-hei!
But a lot of plump and juicy oysters. I want to Ë°®ÁôΩ my love to the uncle #kimkeathokkienmee
Bubbling hot claypot hokkien mee and only $10 for 3 people!! Got clams and additional crispy fried pork belly somemore. (If you like the wet wet kind, must faster eat before the soup bubbles away. Don\'t take too long to Instagram üòÅüòÅüòÅ) The uncle also very nice eh!! Keep making sure we got enough chilli and ask us if we enjoyed his hokkien mee üòç #tgif #technicallyihaditonmonday #caneatalldayerrrday #dinner #sgfood #hawkerfood #kimkeat #hokkienmee #feelandeat #eatoutsg #throwback #foodporn #foodstagram #instafood_sg #igsg #yum #vscocam #vscofood #openricesg #omnomnom #onthetable #burpple

The slightly charred flavour of the noodles, coupled with the right amount of gravy (not too dry or wet) and generous amount of prawns + squid + lala, this is definitely a must try. The opeh leaf is further evidence that this is truly authentic Hokkien Mee ‚ñ† Auntie has told me that they will be opened from Âàù‰∏Ä (thats the first day of CNY) but if you want to be sure, please call Uncle at 9456 0413 to make advance orders (closed on Tues)
with roast pork; serves 2-3 pax;
