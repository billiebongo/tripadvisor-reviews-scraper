The eggs were runny and the spices in the whole dish makes it pops out! The atmosphere is quite chill and it wasn\'t very crowded at this timing. Definitely worth a visit if you are around the neighbourhood!
.\n<br />This contains Kyoto Matcha infused cake sponge, layered with salted egg yolk custard, covered with Matcha frosting and topped with milk custard crumbs.
No stranger to Milo. Growing up, it\'s common to have Milo drink in morning so it\'s always a delight to see dishes created with it. So why not have Buttermilk Waffles with Milo Crumble and Caramelised Banana ($12.90) for breakfast! Their buttermilk waffles are delightful crispy on the outside but light as air inside. Topped with smooth vanilla bean ice cream and Milo sauce for dipping, YUMZ~
Back at this revamp cafe. Need to go on a diet for the next one month. üòù \n<br />Acai Smoothie Bowl ($11.90)
„Äêpoached egg, hollandaise, ikura, shaved asparagus„Äëmoist inside with a crunchy exterior, the crabcake is complemented well by the creaminess of the avocado and the umami of the ikura added a nice finishing touch to it
Was truly a strangers reunion for me haha, met a really really old friend here!üòÇbut strangers reunion, a really lovely cafe. Despite being seated at a relatively packed area, my experience here was still a comfortable one. The food was cafe priced with truffled sweet potato chips at $12.90 and strawberry maceration buttermilk waffles &amp; vanilla ice cream at $13.90. The buttermilk waffles were decently good, and the music here was chill and calming :--) those cafe hopping kinda places I must sayüôÇ
(Anyway, please pardon our conversations. My Friend don\'t know I am videoing üòÇ)
Weekend special. Crispy crab cake topped with a poached egg, adorned with avocado, ribboned asparagus, ikura and aburi chive hollandaise sauce. Wish there was more crab meat though as we couldn\'t really taste it.
Za\'atar Spiced Eggplant Fritters ($12.90)
Just so glad that tomorrow\'s a public holiday.  Happy Sunday :)
DEAL: $5 waffles (only on Fri 26 Aug) with a drink purchase 
Had the buttermilk waffles with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruits ($12.9), the smashed avocado on focaccia ($16.9; $4 extra for goat cheese on the side), and the sweet potato fries ($13.9). Although a little on the pricy side, the food, service, And Ambience were all lovely!
Fell in love with the caramlised walnut w cream cheese! Such a unique combi to match with the egg bens! The veg at the side was pretty raw but was good as well! Expensive but really worth a good treat for yourself! 
White Magic ($7)
I wanted to try their mains today, so I went with my usual House Smoked Salmon Benedict ($18.90), with Hazelnut Bearnaise, Feta, Walnut Crumble, Petit Salad &amp; Sultana Bread. This was a really unique dish, because my \"usual\" would have Hollandaise sauce over Eggs Benedict, but this one had a sweet Hazelnut touch to it, which actually went really well with the Eggs Benedict! I wished they evened out the serving of Salmon because all the Salmon was on one slice of bread, and the other slice didn\'t have any. It was a pretty decent amount of Salmon though, I had more than enough to eat it together with my eggs and bread!\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />In this picture also includes the Buttermilk Waffle with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream ($11.90).\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Check out my blog for the full review of Stranger\'s reunion! www.foodwithnic.wordpress.com
Their Freshly Shaved Prosciutto Benedict is really a mouthful to order. 
I was a little hesitant when the waiter recommended the most expensive waffle on the menu and that there was no weekend special. Well, it was really \"you get what you paid for\"! The rhubarb didn\'t disappoint; it was so tantalising! 
Truffle Fries, Chicken Tenders, House Smoked Salmon Benedict and Sausages and Hash
Owner Ryan Tan is the current World Siphon Champion and a three-time Singapore Barista Champion, so your coffee is in good hands. If you like your coffee clean-tasting with pronounced flavours, go for the Siphon Coffee ($6.90), brewed with seasonal beans. For an espresso-based coffee, try Magic ($5.50). More robust than most milk-based coffee beverages, this is said to be made using the perfect milk to espresso ration.
Quite liked the milo crumble &amp; rum banana complete with vanilla bean ice cream and thick milo sauce. *burp*
I\'ve been working near the place for the past six years not knowing this cozy place is just around the corner.  Who says waffles are only great at breakfast? After a tiring and stressful day at the hospital.....a delectable waffle will surely save the day! ‚ò∫üëç
Really buttermilky crispy-edged airy waffle with subtle and not too overly sweet vanilla ice cream. Berry compote was sour and stronger in taste than the waffle and ice cream. Should order other toppings next time as I don\'t like sour stuffs. The coffee in flat white was not diluted so it was so intense, which I like!
A dish I had in Melbourne and so glad they serve it here in Singapore. Ricotta Hotcake with fresh berries and vanilla ice - cream.
Crispy-outside-soft-inside airy fluffy waffle just like how I love my waffle to be done. And yes to anti-mainstream option ie. greek yoghurt üòù
What can I say? It\'s not bad and it\'s not the best, but still tasty overall. üòä\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
Vodka Crepe Suzette is one of the dishes specially created for the Cafe Week. 8 layer mille crepe, orange caramel sauce and specially imported vodka from Ukraine, it\'s a interesting dessert for a cafe. Plus you\'ll get a fiery surprise too!!
Tuesdays used to be rest days for the staff of Strangers\' Reunion and Curious Palette, but they have decided to forgo their weekly respite and serve customers on Tuesdays for a very special reason - all proceeds from Tuesday sales go towards Save-A-Stranger, an initiative set up to support treatment for head chef Sebastian, who has recently been diagnosed with cancer. It\'s a beautiful and noble cause, so if you\'re looking for a good cuppa, delicious waffles or drinks with friends on Tuesdays, do pop by either place, and help save a Stranger.
This head chef is a friend of mine. If you happen to be looking for a place for coffee or food on Tuesday. Please please please, make your choice or trip down to strangers\' reunion. Every Tuesday\'s sales revenue will proceed to Sebastian\'s treatment. Render some support and do some good cause. Remember, every Tuesday! They got very good coffee and waffles! And they have more than one outlets! (Save-A-Stranger)\n<br />Dine for a good cause on Tuesdays, and help save a stranger.He may be a stranger to you, but he‚Äôs an important member of our Strange family.
Had the waffle with vanilla bean ice cream and berry compote. The subtle vanilla ice cream went well with the crispy waffle. Only complaint I have is that I didn\'t expect the compote to be so sour, which completely overpowered the ice cream and waffle
Glazed peaches, sunflower seed, pumpkin seed, sultana soaked in ginger beer are some of the toppings found, add a large scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and I\'m a happy girl üíï
An assault of richness and flavour as you dig in crispy marinated chicken accompanied with a stack of waffles. Plus there\'s healthy sides of red cabbage slaw and corn salad that get rids of the oily taste.
Can\'t go wrong with oozy egg yolk atop gratinated ham &amp; cheese focaccia. I\'m not usually a fan of eggs Benedict, but this was too good to pass up. Can\'t wait to have it again during Cafe Week in December.\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />Reservations for Cafe Week is open now for Nom\'s members at cafeweek.sg\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />If you\'re not already a Nom\'s member, sign up at nomnom.sg with the code \"EtXNoms\" for just $9.90 (usual price $15/year).\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />Check out the Stranger\'s Reunion menu for brunch/tea/dinner and other participating cafes at cafeweek.sg\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />#StrangersReunion #CafeWeekSG #OpenRiceSG #EggsBenedict

One of the dish that woah me. Perfectly executed egg benedict drizzled with herb hollandaise on top of savoury gratinated ham and cheese focaccia. It\'s accompanied with garden-fresh asparagus and rocket salad, giving it a refreshing bitter taste. Strongly recommended for egg benedict lovers to try!
‚ãÖ\n<br />#StrangersReunion #Coffee #Barista
First taste was normal, but it gets more tasty as you eat! 
Generous portion of fries, surprisingly tasty especially with the truffle oil mayo sauce! 
strong truffle taste! the soup is kinda watery but the mushroom taste is still strong!
this serving is so huge. definitely to share! nt my food can\'t comment much.
the sauce is so so delicious. nth spectacular abt the eggs n toast. huge portion again.
Love the eggs but the taste of the vegetable was raw even though a little bit of salt was added to it and I love the raisin bread with salmon, they go along well ($18.90)
Late night indulgence because it\'s one of the cafes which opens till midnight. [Crispy Calamari with Wasabi Guava Salad S$14.90] - the wasabi guava salad is pretty special. Ok, see you at the other side, have a great Saturday ahead! üëãüèª
[Cappuccino S$4.90] + [Flat White S$4.90] and most importantly  it\'s one of the few cafes that opens till late! \"If you treat people right, they will treat you right - 90% of the time\"
Oh boy, I heard so much about their waffles and they are sooooo delicious! Fluffy and crispy and everything I want in a waffle. Just left me wanting for more! 
Strangers is also very famous for their coffee. I chose to have their filtered brew coffee (it\'s my current fav) and the current beans they carried were really nice. It was acidic yet it had a sweet and citrusy taste to it. I liked that they had a note that comes along explaining more about the beans and the best way to enjoy the coffee. Mine was syphon brewed today. 
Strangers Reunion signature buttermilk waffles ($14.90) paired with vanilla ice cream and berries compote.
Give this a miss. Sounds interesting, but tasted like a gimmick. 
Crispy yet soft buttermilk waffles + brewed tea on a lovely afternoon with the best friend üíï 
Buttermilk waffles with artisan greek yoghurt and fresh fruits (bottom) ($8.50), Buttermilk waffles with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruits (top) ($8.50), Hot Chocolate (right) ($5.50) &amp; Iced Mocha ($6.50). The Buttermilk waffles were HEAVEN. I would go back any day. I shouldn\'t have ordered yoghurt though, it was too sour. Ice cream went very well with the waffles! 
This is amazing . We were finding a cafe ( which we were frustrated and couldnt find) and my friend suggested this . This is really amazing . Its not cheap but encourage u to share with a friend . Must try !! 
The egg benedict is a perfect heavenly meal to start your day, and the portion is just right for a brunch meal as well. I have no complaint, really. ;)
üåºRate: 8/10 The truffle fries taste awesome!Especially wif the truffle oil+mayonnaise. And is super big also! Serving should be enough for at least 3 people! :D
üåºRate: 6/10 The hotcake is fluffy and a bit crunchy and the decoration looks like a forest. üôÜ But overall it taste super normal.
üåºRate: 4.5/10 The omelette was nice but the ham taste a bit weird. Not my liking tbh.  :(
At $19, this beautiful piece of food is not only instagram-worthy, but also has a huge portion and is so delicious I enjoyed every bite of it. (imo, it\'s better than paddy hill\'s version of hotcake) though both might have the same crispy edges, but this one is softer and has a less poundcake-like texture. Somewhere in the middle of a pancake and a pound cake? Furthermore, it has vanilla bean ice cream instead of cheese over @ paddy hill\'s, though I wish they could be more generous with the ice cream to go with the huge hotcake. But overall, really really love this berries ricotta hotcake! 4.30/5.0
And I go - I really really really really really really like you.
Inspired by the one served in Top Paddock in Australia, this one however seems to be in another class of its own with the other variant served in another cafe. Ricotta was evident in the batter of the one here; the hotcake itself was more like a fluffy and light Japanese Cheese Cake rather than a dense pound cake with crisp exterior, and the maple syrup served at the side instead of being mixed into the batter. There were berries scattered over the top, making it aesthetically pleasing as though it is an edible garden but the inclusion of the pumpkin seeds added crunchiness to give a contrast to the texture of the hotcake. Vanilla Ice Cream tops off the hotcake instead of cream cheese so as to add a sweet, luscious twist to the hotcakes. Overall both variants are rather heavy, but this was generally a bit lighter and the elements seemed to be more cohesive as a dish in general, though both have stark differences while being based off the same concept.
The truffle fries here are really good, beats lots of places and thus became my favorite so far. The fries are perfect, still crisp even after some time, the dip itself enhances the flavor which made it so yummy and addictive. Must try and must have, worth every penny. 
The duck meat is a little tough. But the overall taste was ok. (3/5)
Dip those fries into the sauce beside it. It really good. But those fries are already good on its own! 4/5
Good but not best. Fluffy waffles that are not too dense. 
One of the best buttermilk waffles. Wasn\'t too sweet and the fruits were fresh. The cafe had a very nice ambience.
Decided to traipse to @strangersreu for their famed Buttermilk Waffles  and Magic coffee on Thursday. I should have known when my friends warned me about the deteriorating quality of their waffles, but I brushed that aside. 
Why not have two sausages at one go? Each have their own distinct flavour, texture and meatiness. Nice ambience at the cafe to feel relaxed, yet not too far from CBD area. You might see handful of doctors during lunch since its next to SGH. 
Best waffles I\'ve tasted so far. Crispy on the outside. Topped with fresh fruits and maple syrup. Not too sweet which is perfect for me. 
I was craving for fresh veggies rather than carbs today, and made a healthier choice. They put smushed avocado more than I expected. 
Strangers houses not just one, but a team of top SNBC baristas. The Latte art here is game strong. 
The Strangers\' scrumptious brunch of Berry Ricotta Hotcake served with fresh berries, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, maple syrup and a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream.
Greek yogurt, honey and mixed fruits on a buttermilk waffle | Pricey for a waffle, but oh-so-good. No one does this medley quite as well as SR: its simple toppings working magic with the crisp and fluffiness of the waffles :-) also pictured: truffle pasta
If you haven\'t spotted the food trend, it\'s definitely Berry Ricotta Hotcakes! It was so good that i exclaimed, \"It\'s so fluffy,\" after the first bite. This is just one version of it - stayed tuned for more.
What I like about this ice cream is that it doesn\'t melt fast considering it\'s placed on a hot waffle. And also its creaminess and sweetness are just right.
They brewed Rwandan Buf Cafe Nyarusiza from Rwanda today ($6.90). Tasting notes: floral (rose floral aromas), sweet citrus lemony notes with plenty of mulling spices as per their description on the little brown paper. I honestly appreciate these small things caf√©s do for their customers to educate. Check them out for their filtered coffee as they do decent cuppas! (Come before 10.30am on Saturdays)
Soft and fluffy Waffle with good consistency! For my personal preference, I wished the Yoghurt was served a tad colder.
Buttermilk waffles topped with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruits from Stranger\'s Reunion cafe. \n<br />Love the crisp waffles and that vanilla ice cream! Heart those little vanilla beans specks! \n<br />Heading to a friend\'s wedding now. Have a great weekend üíï ÈÄ±Êú´„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Éà„Åß„Åô! „ÉØ„ÉÉ„Éï„É´„ÅÆÊúù„Åî„ÅØ„Çì„Åß„Åô„Äú
4/5 stars! the food there was great and the interior was lovely (cute flowers) the only downside was that we reached there at 5:30 and had to wait quite awhile for our food as dinner only served at 6pm. Price was suitable for the delicious food and relatively easy to find! 
pronounced acidic, clean fruitty subtle apricot with a hint of nuttiness. Pretty good coffee. \n<br />Was visiting cafes today for a new article and stopped by. Asked if i could sample a cup for writeup, and got directed to wait (ill gladly just pay if they dont do sampling). After 30 mins waiting, they asked if i could just pay for the coffee. Argh i would have done that from the beginning if they just said so.
Truffles Fries, Smashed Avocado and Buttermilk Waffle. Fries was worth mentioning and the Smashed Avocado on Focaccia. Ice Black was good as well.
The other time I came, I had the same waffles but with fresh fruits like sliced strawberries and bananas as toppings instead, which I felt was a better, sweeter combination with the tangy yogurt as compared to this sourish berry compote.
Stranger\'s Reunion is one of my to-go places for good brunch esp. when I\'m craving for waffles. They do a pretty good eggs Benedict as well, and I love that they use prosciutto ham instead of usual ham, as it adds much more flavor and taste to the dish. Love the walnut bread as well.
I keep coming back for waffles at stranger\'s reunion, and definitely a plus point that they serve coffee with non-fat milk (many cafes don\'t even have low- fat milk)! Gives you a reason to feel ok indulging in their yummy buttermilk waffles!
It feels like home whenever i take a visit to Strangers\' Reunion. It\'s one of the cafes that I still patronized for good coffee. Everything changes but theirs don\'t. So if you\'re in need of coffee, you can consider visiting them!
Can\'t help but \"steal\" this photo from Ru\'Ai as I think this is such an Instagram and Vsco worthy post to share. Taking coffee photography and the beauty of minimalism to a whole new level, tattoos are a must.
I don\'t have anything new to add to the numerous positive Burps of the waffles from this cafe. It really was good - light and crunchy yet still a little chewy. Fruit was fresh and the vanilla bean ice-cream, generous. 
Cut through the golden crumb-covered crunchiness of the deep fried poached egg and the gorgeous yolk flows out, coating the arugula leaves and partially hidden large, juicy portobello mushroom nicely. I adored the fragrant pesto sauce but felt the foccacia bread was a tad on the dry side. 
Very aptly named. The crepes were indeed soft and fluffy, and they tasted fabulous with fillings of mozzarella, sour cream, beetroot relish and saut√©ed mushrooms (an add-on I couldn\'t resist getting). This is a must-try if you are into savoury crepes.\n
With so many cafes serving this, you can\'t help but draw comparisons. Well, this is is easily one of the nicer versions in my opinion. The fries here aren\'t greasy at all nor are they hard from over-frying. And the truffle flavour is definitely noticeable. Topped with very finely shaved Parmesan, tiny bits of shaved truffle and served with a shot glass of truffled aioli, this bowl of fries has the ability to disappear in minutes.
Love love the waffles at Stranger\'s Reunion, and it\'s amazing how a simple dish of waffles, strawberries and vanilla bean ice cream can be such a delight! üçì
Buttermilk is not too sour and waffles is crisps at the edges 
The MAGIC coffee which didn\'t taste very magical but it sure did keep me up all day and all night long after drinking. ($5.50+)
I don\'t know about you, but it\'s a personal favourite! Defintely a happy geek üòÅ
Waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It leaves a bitter aftertaste so I think it was a bit charred. Could go easy on the salt in the waffle batter.
Definitely making it\'s way into any local foodie\'s list of best waffles. Light and fluffy, served with ice cream and some fruits. Good to try their Magic too! 
Who says no to truffle? Shoe string fries drizzled with black truffle bits and Parmesan cheese, and dipped into the truffled aioli - a must-have at Strangers!
The waffles are crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. Accompanied with the maple syrup which possesses a balanced sweetness, it is what makes the waffles so delicious even on its own ! The brewed coffee was flavourful and satisfying. Will definitely be back for more despite the scarce legroom available as well as it being too crowded.
The truffle fries and waffles are the must-order dishes when you\'re there! The waffles were fluffy and goes really well with the ice cream. ;D The fries weren\'t too salty. However, the food there is quite pricey and there\'s a crowd during dinner period.
I\'m not a big fan of waffles but these are too good not to mention. Very soft, yet crispy. Despite being topped with a berry compote and ice cream, the waffle didn\'t turn soggy.
Yea, again &amp; again. Because they r the best in the world..

That rare time I was off from my course and work due to an unexpected cancelation of class in my course meant I had time to find good truffle fries :)
I\'m a waffle and pancake person. Haha! There are only certain places does very nice waffle! I like it crispy and kinda airy inside. Strangers\' Reunion does one of the best waffle. What\'s more to look forward to is their in house made artisan yogurt! It\'s really good with fresh fruits! Sometimes whenever I got cravings, I grab my iPad and head down to have this with a pot of tea. Chill out and read some books! I love time to myself like this!
Tasty! Well now i know what everyone was talking about. Waffle was fluffy and a bit bitter but the ice cream covers the bitterness and make the meal an extravagant dish top with berries n bananaz. Its better to make a reservation if u dont want to wait üòã
Awesome atmosphere with sofas (for seats against the wall) and cushions! Their Truffle Fries are good too. The amount of fries are more than enough!
Strangers reunion is well known for their great waffles and coffee! I had a hot chocolate and this plate of waffles to indulge in and it was super good!! Although it\'s a little pricey and the service is a little slow ,nonetheless it\'s a place and one of the caf√©s that you should go to!
Meeting with the editor of Poached Mag accompanied by this mid-morning breakfast made my trip to Singapore! I need to come back more often
Love the coffee there. First time having their waffles. Very tasty and fluffy. Having a slight sour tinge to it, but it\'s ok with all that fluffiness. 
Spinach served w pomegranate, orange, cherry tomatoes, pistachios and red wine vinagrette. Good but pricey doe. Truffle fries were delicious w the truffle aioli. Coffee was bomb üëç
Crunched unpleasantly into a clump of salt. Just.. no.
I see nothing special in their buttermilk waffles, it doesn\'t hav the aroma that I anticipated. Mocha wasn\'t strong enough for me. In all I would only probably recommend the smoked duck aglio alio pasta. 
Waffles standard has dropped. Very light and airy. Would prefer it to be more dense.
Amazing waffles and cakes ! Another place to ÈÇÇÈÄÖÔºåwhere strangers fall in love with #strangersreunion
delicious and sweet waffles. affordable. The sweet potatoes fries very nice.
Vanilla is not my favourite but here, it is good. Can taste the vanilla bean in it! #foodporn #waffles #saturdaynight
The hollandaise sauce , egg itself w the combination of parma ham is brilliant! This main definitely scores for being really yummy and how appetizing it looks on the plate. Although ts quite heavy flavored it doesn\'t tastes overwhelming too. Must try for their mains.
Serves super good buttermilk waffles and the best cup of coffee ever, the yogurt with granola is very good too.
good cup of coffee is without saying at Strangers, but if you insanely still need another reason, go for the waffles. you may need clinical help if you still don\'t find your tastebuds thanking you
Waffles were great and at an affordable price but the coffee was a let down though. It was too milky even for a picollo latte however the latte art was fantastic and i would totally revisit this cute little cafe again for the waffles! 
Stranger\'s Reunion is always a trusty pal for kickass coffee and waffles. Go for the Magic for a perfect cuppa, and relax with a book.
Always a truffle lover and this! Does not disappoint. Tho dont xpect toooooo much XD (tho the place set up is just AMAZING)
The waffles are sooooooo gd and fragrant it just makes your night! ....tho the dish is a bit dry be warned.
Sweet white chocolate balanced by the light cake sponge and sourish rasberry~
Definitely a MUST ORDER at SR.The smell and taste of the truffle oil just lingers around, even having the thought to take away another set!
The new dish was a hit and a miss. The pasta wasn\'t as al dente as I expected it to be, but the truffle and parmesan cheese make up for everything.
Some really interesting items on the new menu - especially the halibut which was fried tempura-style | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
Sinful sinful spam fries but oh-so-good! The serving\'s a little large for two persons, great finger snack for groups. \'Baked eggs\' is nice and runny, engulfed within tangy tomato gravy and minced meat, mmm yummy.
Despite walking by several times, this is the first time I\'m actually dining here. Brought my work laptop but there\'s no free Wi-Fi (weak connection via Wireless@SG) :( Good thing I\'ve got my own USB dongle. Lovely place, nice service.
Yummy, it was deliciously good waffle and pretty nice cup of latte art. Good ambience for catching up with old friend. $15 for waffle, isn\'t that bad right? ;)
&amp; without a doubt, this MUST be ordered when one comes to Strangers!!
Recently I heard that the waffles here doubled in price but not size, and became a main item. Luckily this was not the case. The waffles with maple syrup is still delicious whoohoo and still $11.90!!! Im going to come here for the sweet potato fries next. Happy day! 
Still lusting over these waffles. Hope I dream of them haha. 
Love the black truffle bits. The truffle-mayo has only a slight hint of truffle oil and more lemony taste.. Would be better if more truffle oil is added! 
Beautiful cafe! Love the Grated truffle with seasalt fries and truffle aioli!  Yummy waffles but I\'ll like it even more if it\'s crispier!
Survived midweek. 2 more days to weekend. I so need a coffee right now.  Last Friday nite with good friends over coffee #friendsforlife #blessed
For those who loves waffles. Try their vast selection of waffles. From fruity waffles to creamy ones. Definitely a good place to hangout with friends on a friday night.
Fluffy Savory Crepes.\n<br />.
The best thing about this visit was definitely the waffles. We also had \"Magic\" coffee and a Cappucino. The coffee art is good. Definitely worth another visit! Price is reasonable.
The berry goes well with the ice cream. And the caffe latte is pretty satisfying. M
Last shot of perfection. Waffles with macerated strawberries and vanilla ice cream. In love! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Magic coffee with the magical proportion of coffee and milk.
Finally made it to #strangersreunion with @ediblehappiness and @yslim88. We had our coffee and buttermilk waffles fix. Satisfied now üëç
The taste of the truffle oil wasnt too strong. Love how generous they are with the cheese and the combination of mayo and lemon was amaaaazeballs! The price was $12.90! 
The dish wasnt too sweet nor sour as the sweetness of the ice-cream balanced out with the sourness of the berries. The waffles are thick and fluffy! It costs $14.90.
You\'ll be dead by this waffle..!!! Hahaha.. It\'s sooooo delicious...!!!
Life is sweet, TGIF!
It was delicious! Unsure of which is better, Wimbly Lu\'s or this as I haven\'t tried Wimbly\'s. Any waffle hangouts to recommend? üòä The price was quite affordable too! 
Fuel FTW | Marie\'s Visit at Strangers Reunion \n<br />Feta Pumpkin Salad ($14.90), Lotus Root Chips ($11.90), Magic ($5.50), Lady Grey ($7.00) and Yogurt Waffles ($12.90 not featured)
The star of the show! The sweetness of the vanilla balanced out the sourness perfectly. =w=~
Waffles were fluffy, but the ice cream and portion for fruits were rather lacklustre. Not worth the long queues but I\'d have it again if I\'m in the area (and there\'s no queue)
Buttermilk Waffles with Artisan Greek Yogurt &amp; Vanilla Ice Cream with fruits (12.90$ each) and Truffle Fries for 12.90$ as well. Thought the crowd was a little overwhelming with the noise; could barely communicate or hold a conversation w/o raising my voice. The staffs were all very attentive which we really appreciate. Overall, I\'d give it a üëç
It\'s interesting how good #food bring people together. Strangers become friends, while families and friends who eat together eventually feel a lot closer.\n<br />.
Deliciously huge Red Velvet Waffle topped with Vanilla ice cream and pistachios with chopped strawberries &amp; chocolate syrup.  Its was so goooooood. Worth a try!
Red Velvet Waffles for brunch on a rainy &amp; wet Monday. Delicious waffles with Vanilla ice cream and pistachios sprinkled with strawberries and chocolate syrup.
Our first Weekend of the New Year Twenty One-Four!
Bangkok Inspired Red Velvet Waffles IMO! This is one of the reasons why I\'m back at Strangers on a packed Saturday morning!
Espresso with steamed milk served in mismatching cups; home to the Singapore National Barista Championship, Strangers Reunion serves a good cup of coffee with pretty latte art.   
Sour yogurt complementing the sweet waffles with fruit toppings. For the health conscious ones.
good for sharing over drinks and chatter. too much for one. best eaten when still warm and crispy!
Strangers\' Reunion\'s light buttermilk waffles topped with Greek yoghurt, honey and fresh berries has been hailed the best waffle in town by many. It\'s hard to fight these near-perfect waffles, so warm and fluffy you almost never knew a waffle could be that good. The yoghurt / berries/ honey combination leaves you feeling refreshed and satiated at the same time. Try these if you haven\'t yet. Photo by Jiehui Teo.
[ Iced Mocha ] COLD DRINK BUT NOT MINE. MOMMY\'S.. üò™ (taste: pretty normal)
[ Buttermilk Waffles with Maple Syrup &amp; Fresh Fruits ] I think this is better than the greek yogurt combi. Fresh &amp; sweet banana. Generous serving on the maple syrup. Good~ happy food satisfied.
Still my favorite..but today\'s a bit disappointed as e waffle tends to be over bake...
Warm, fluffy waffles and a side of homemade spices chai latte. Price: $12.90/$5.90
how i wish time can pass til next year so tt everthing can start anew again. cant wait. new  job new opportunties. anyways this coffee was recommendes to be one of de best around..
Today\'s pour. What makes my day is really just as simple as when you see a smile from your customers. Happy Thanksgiving Day everyone!
The perfect moment when the salmon pieces on the ciabata bread is delightfully coated by the thick yolks
Didn\'t get to try the cheesecake but from the looks of it, it was rich and creamy with just the right amount of chocolate. Apple crumble was a bit of a let down, expected it to be better. Crust was a little dry and thick but the apple filling was just right and the tastes was good. The best part is the ice-cream. It was so rich and flavourful and it left me wanting for more.
Virgin experience at strangers reunion and I am really impressed with the service and food. Fries were amazing, parmesan cheese on the top made it rich and flavourful. Highly recommend that this should be shared with a group of friends as the portion is pretty big.
Yums but ordered too much for 2 and it was a whooping $48! üôÄ
Spam Fries with additional Truffle Aioli. Junk food rocks. #spam #fries #junkfood #fattening #yum #foodporn #sgfood
Poached Eggs on Ciabatta Toast with Smoked Salmon &amp; Hollandaise. Made the mistake of ordering this over the buttermilk waffles - the egg yolks came 50% cooked through and barely oozed so everything was terribly dry. Hollandaise was far too gluggy and needed more lemon. \n<br />#poached #eggs #ciabatta #toast #salmon #hollandaise #brunch #disappointing #foodporn #sgfood
Great expectations for this one because of its rave reviews. Sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly tasteless waffle batter. 3.5/5
This is a popular one: Generous bowl of tasty, shoestring fries. I just couldn\'t help but compare this to Symmetry\'s though. There is relatively less truffle going on, and the mayo sauce disappointed slightly. Still, 4.5/5
My favourite combi!
Light and fluffy buttermilk waffles, fresh cut fruits and milky vanilla ice cream. I love how it doesn\'t make me feel too full too easily
Light and fluffy waffles that bore subtle Buttermilk flavour in the batter. The Macerated Strawberries were part sweet part sour; great with ice-cream
(1) Stranger\'s Reunion - Truffle Fries, Buttermilk waffles with strawberry maceration and vanilla ice cream, buttermilk waffles with artisan Greek yogurt and fresh fruits, and \"Magic\" coffee.. 1 down, 19 to go!
Who loves this too!? Put your hands up in the air üòÇüôå #sgfood \n<br />Vanilla Icecream x Banana x Btrawberries x Blueberry x Waffle .
I\'m finally here! Yay-ee-yay~ Ordered 2 cuppa [MAGIC] that made up of double ristretto with their special ratio of milk at $5.50 each. Loves the strong coffee taste. Though I\'m a sweet lover but I just love this bitter strong taste, so no sugar added!! Also ordered their (superrrr) famous [Buttermilk Waffles w. Vanilla Ice-cream &amp; Fruits] at $12.90. Fluffy waffles with the very shiok ice-cream &amp; sweet fruits. Splendid remedy for this hot weather!! Loves~ I must come again.
The [Truffle Fries]... Not bad but definitely lose to PS Cafe. Lol. Generous with the truffle oil but the special mayo sauce was so damn diluted... (I wonder why). $12.90 for quite a big portion.
Sunday brunch @ Stranger\'s Reunion. Wasn\'t that impressed with the food but ambience was cozy to hang out with friends #cafe #singapore
Good coffee, the place seemed to be full of light especially aft shifting to a bigger space. Can\'t remember what\'s \'magic\' cuz it wasn\'t mine..
Me like. Not too sweet and it\'s just perfectly balanced.
ONE OF THE BEST WAFFLES I TRIED I SWEAR! üòä highly recommended 
One of my favourite waffles. 
Pretty coffee art, but am still not really a \"coffee person\". :)
Best waffle i\'ve tried so far. Keep going back again and again for this!

Dominates in aroma and cup, supported by dark chocolate pungent. Sweet toned acidity with a flavor-saturated finish. 
Fresh buttermilk waffles crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. It\'s definitely food for the soul!
Waffles are exquisite. What a pity I can\'t get to eat it everyday. Missing the love from yesterday\'s. #latergram
Love the truffle fries, because I\'m pretty much a couch potato.
Dinner is served! Between spam fries and truffle fries, I chose po-ta-to! üçü
I\'ve waffled before, I\'ll waffle again. Still number one in my list, and stays number one!
With lemon emulsion, squid ink and fennel
Close-up of this glorious plate of waffles. Glad I finally tried it, ending my sad-first-day-of-school on a good note. Would\'ve loved to stay in the cafe longer but it was too crowded.
So good so good. The Greek yogurt makes it even better.
Generous dose of truffle oil, but lacklustre fries though. Overall, not too bad. 
While the waffle was good, the ice cream was blehhh. For the price we were paying, we were expecting real vanilla bean ice cream. Oh well... =/
the boyfriend kinda liked this but I prefer Wild Honey\'s Tunisian Breakfast or CBTL\'s Morroccan Lamb Casserole to this anytime! =X
I\'m trying to cut down a little on eating desserts, on sweets, keep my sugar level down, which is tough. Because I love Desserts! I really do! Loving all the good stuff, and green things, that matches up my favorite lists! üíö
Me and my crispy pork belly with truffled mash, ginger beer, apple and date chutney! üê∑
The meat wasn\'t as tender as expected and because it was shredded, it became cold too fast and it wasn\'t even hot to begin with. it\'s supposed to be cooked for 12 hours to be tender enough. the only thing that saved this was the flat bread
it was bland. the wagyu beef taste wasn\'t there. It was very crumbly and the bun was below average.
it\'s ok if you did it yourself but for $11, not really. It\'s not something you\'ll come back for. very ordinary. just a plain waffle topped with normal ingredients you can pulk out from your pantry. nothing special.
well, it was nice to pass as normal fries although it had a certain mushroomy taste which I think comes from the truffle oil? it was too salty and even if it tasted good, it was just as good as fries. not as fries from a restaurant. it was crispy though
Perfect start to the weekend :) waffles with maple syrup and fresh fruit really hit the spot for my pancake craving today...
Kinda prefer their old menu and environment actually. What\'s new may not always be what\'s better. 
At the newly renovated strangers\' reunion. Prices are kinda crazy now and food is not even fantastic. I\'d say just stick to the waffles and coffee.
All time favourite waffle with maple syrup.
Arguably the best waffle in town. 
How can I miss it!!! Buttermilk waffle with vanilla ice cream... I love it !!! Hehe... #yummy #dessert
A cup of latte &amp; matcha azuki cake to begin with... and...I proceed on to my pork belly topped with mashed potatoes &amp; apple stripes... #igfood #foodporn
Rosette challenged! Here\'s the magic ratio of milk and coffee #foodporn #strangersreunion
One of favourite places for brunch. Pleasant surprise today though - they\'ve expanded their cafe to accommodate more seats. Always know I can get a consistently great cuppa caffeine here.
Opted for something outside of my eggs benny Sunday brunch routine today and tried something a little more adventurous - of course I had to have something with a perfectly poached egg still! The tomato relish contrasted the creamy avocado and the poached egg well, with the texture of the corn nibblets giving every bite a great punch!
They never screw up your morning routine. One of my favourite coffee spots.
pretty bland and doughy. texture of all the ingredients were too similar. meh. 
Lovely place, good coffee! And nice waffles and Greek yogurt! Gotta try their  sandwiches next!:)
We have to say that Strangers\' Reunion simply does the best waffles in Singapore. Don\'t let that distract you from the amazing cup of coffee you\'re bound to get here, seeing it comes from our National Barista Champion, Ryan Tan. You won\'t be disappointed. * Strangers\' has recently renovated, go check out their new menu and bigger space!

I am treating myself to this matcha waffle.\n<br />üîπüî∏\n<br />Positively liked the oranges, blueberries and azuki. Even tho the waffle was crispy, I find it a tad overdone.

Very fragrant and it\'s good on its own with its rich buttery milky taste. Berry taste a little sour for me and it does have the \'tin can\' berry taste.  Ice cream is is nice and smooth..

#saveastranger #thisisnotacommerical i went down early this Saturday morning and have my #flatwhite and a Greek yogurt buttermilk waffles at @strangersreu and give my tiny donations. Hope it helps in any way! The barista must be wondering why do I ask for a take away cup when I\'m having my coffee there. Hahaha! #collectingcups #makemoments
The fluffy waffles were crispy and light in texture, melting in the mouth with a faintly-detectable buttermilk fragrance. The fried chicken was fairly normal; it went well eaten together with the waffle, cabbage slaw and corn salad in one bite.
It was the most innovative and tasty dish of the night - loved the crusty battering of the egg and the tasty fillings within the halved hard-boiled egg. The cheddar stood out in particular, heightening the overall flavour of this dish.
sounds familiar? \n<br />Surprises are the best part of Christmas...so I was happy to learn from a sweet friends @cptslowyeo that I was one of the lucky winners of @OpenRiceSG \'s Cafe Week contest. A contest I wasn\'t even aware of.... so here I am, enjoying a hearty Cafe Week meal consisting of 3-courses at Strangers\' Reunion. Thank you OpenRice and Nomnom for this lovely treat!

All for just $15 nett.\n<br />The tea has a honeysuckle smell, with a wine like taste but without the alcohol in it.\n<br />The topping on the waffle is great - nutty, fruity, milky and creamy. However the waffle isn\'t as crispy and airy to my liking. It\'s a bit too dense for me.\n<br />|\n<br />Strangers\' Reunion\n<br />Address : 33/35/37 Kampong Bahru Road, Singapore 169355\n<br />Tel : 6222 4869\n<br />Open : \n<br />Sun, Mon, Wed, Thu : 9am-10pm\n<br />Fri, Sat : 9am-12am\n<br />#PickatSG #Pickateer #YummyPin #8DaysEat #OpenRiceSG #InstaFood_SG #Burpple #SGIG #InstaSG #ExSGCafes #ExploreSingapore #TSLmakan #EatOutSG #PhotoMoolah #IGerSpotLight #SGFood #IGers #FoodPorn #Food #InstaFood #Singapore #SingaporeInsiders #SGFoodies #EatBookSG #WhereToEatSG #YelpSG #OpenSnapSG #CafeWeek2015

Good plain waffles with a hot glass of latte
Had a fantastic ham &amp; cheese omelette for brunch
Not the normal deep fried calamari rings which we are so used to! Deep fries to the correct doneness without make it too hars to chew and crispy. The dipping sauce is of thai sweet and sour style and the comes with white radish and carrot pickle.  Simply a great small bite! #cafehopping #lovecafe #lovefood #calamari #crispysquid #strangersreunion #burpple #smallbite
At Stranger\'s Reunion, their ice coffee is a coffee ice cream float! A big ball of vanilla ice cream within the glass of coffee!  Rather refreshing but the ice cream does overwhelmed the taste of the coffee itself. But perfect for a hot day! #lovecafe #lovefood #cafehopping #awesomecafe #coolcafe #burpple #strangersreunion #icecoffee #coffeefloat

My date for Valentine\'s day. ‚òïÔ∏è Brewing the Hacienda La Esmeralda Panama Geisha on the syphon - dry fragrance contains hints of honey and milk chocolate, the wet aroma has a high intensity of floral sweetness. The cup itself has a light and mellow body and the right amount of flavorful floral brightness with a delicate finish. What an intense cup. Be sure to grab it while it lasts! #syphon #strangersreunion #panama #geisha #brew #coffee #filter #roast #black #cafesg #nolatteart

Still my favourite waffles so far.
Nothing like a gathering of loved ones over drinks and gossip. Seriously, who is that promiscuous blogger that dances topless at clubs? HA
The truffle fries at strangers was decent, the truffle flavor and smell wasn\'t as overwhelming as symmetry and SPR MRKT. But overall, it\'s still good :)

Noted as the first cafe in Singapore to have brought in the Magic, it is in fact similar to a Flat White but having a \"magical ratio\" of milk to the coffee. Found nothing much special with the Magic here; probably other cafes are serving similar ratios with their Flat Whites these days.

Even though they are famous for their coffee, but I must say their ice chocolate is one of the best that I\'ve tried so far.
