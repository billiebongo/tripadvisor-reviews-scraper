Amazing dish with 3 eggs as the base: Salted egg, Century egg and regular egg. The spinach is simmered in this flavorful egg concoction at the perfect doneness. Love it!
This is spectacular! Love the slightly crunchy texture of the sea cucumber achieved through frying it slightly, which seals in all the flavours. 
Saying this has just too much \"wok hei\" is an understatement. The Teochew call it \"chao huay tah\"（臭火干), the burnt kuay teow is the only dish that disappoint.
Traditional teochew cuisine (what else since it resides in a teochew club) Must Tries, Roast Pig, Braised Duck, Ee-Fu Noodles. Yummehlicious
 It is a contemporary looking restaurant decorated with Chinese brocade screens and traditional Chinese musical instruments. Here\'s a photo of Teochew Puning Fermented Bean Chicken. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/chui-huay-lim-teochew-cuisine/
I quite liked this dish. It was light and tangy. Nothing like the usual thick yam you\'d get at Chinese restaurants.
We celebrated Father\'s Day dinner / Mum\'s birthday / Dad\'s birthday at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Restaurant! Here\'s their braised duck. :)
very good teochew fare and a nice restaurant for family meals.
I normally don\'t do yam pastes, but Chui Huay Lim got it spot on. It\'s perfectly balanced; not too heavy (gelat), not too sweet. The portion was also just right; leaves you satiated and wanting to come back for more next weekend.
Sweet lobster meat and the garlic adds spice to the meal. 
Good succulent meat. 
Chye Poh Kway Teow! •\n<br />•\n<br />It’s one of those unassuming dishes that just wins your tummy over. Simple ingredients - kway teow, Chye Poh (ie 菜莆), kai lan, yet when they come together : 🤩🤩🤩🤩 *flavour explosion* Everyone at the table loved it (all egging me on to order the large portion order). One of the few Teochew dishes that this half-baked Teochew ah niah can actually truly appreciate 😜\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#happyfood #happybelly #friyay #happythoughts #醉花林 #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfooddiary #sgfoodpics #foodstagram #foodtography #foodpics #instafood #chyepoh #chyepohkwayteow #cannotstopeating #nonstopeating #fatdieme #burpple #burpplesg #kosyeats #kosyeatssg
#chuihuaylimteochewcuisine magically transforms it into an amazing dish, how do they do it?! Love the broth and you can taste the wok-hei. My must-have when we are there. #spinach #centuryegg #saltedegg #wokhei #finishedeverybitofit #sgrestaurants #sgeats #burpple #sundayfamilydinner
Must-try braised goose. The meat is juicy.
//One of my most memorable CNY dinners was held here! If you like Garlic &amp; lobster, you should not miss this! The two lobbies served are HUUUGE – enough to feed 13 of us. \n<br />Flesh is as sweet as the ones I\'ve had at New York 😍 \n<br />Interesting part is how they\'ve cooked them – braised in a sauce that\'s finger lickin\' good. Garlic is in over-abundance, but I\'m not complaining at all!! Had like twenty of them 😆 \n<br />#garlic #obsession #WardAwayVampires #OhYeah #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #sgfood #sgeats #burrple #burpplesg #yummy #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #foodporn #foodstagram #bostonlobster #lobster #seafood #teochew #chinesenewyear #cny #chuihuaylinteochewcuisine

The wings were stewed to very soft texture in a highly flavourful lor sauce. but being goose wings, there\'s not too much meat to it\n<br />👍👍👍 #burpple #pickyeaterssg #8dayseatout  #8dayseat #foodstagram #indulge #foodie #foodsg #foodcoma #foodgasm #foodinsg #foodpics #foodspotting #foodstamping #foodphotography #lunch #instasg #instafood #instagood #instadelicious #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgfoodlover #sg #igsg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #nice #foodpornsg

Probably the best suckling pig. Ever. Nuff said
