Contains 2 large piece of chicken thigh/drum and 3 fresh prawns
I wonder how they nv overcooked their r√∂sti...
Favourite wrap at marche for $16.90++. However, there are other wraps at $13-14 too :) 
Can\'t do without this all-time favourite. üòã 
The fruit pieces are fresh but the sponge cake could be softer. Please read my full review at https://www.xiaoyangmeimei.blogspot.sg
With saut√©ed mushrooms, shredded cheese, salad, roasted mushrooms. Yum Yums~ a little too much for me though....
Not too bad. But the \"aunty\" doing up the crepes was angsty. Kinda appalling service at Marche 
It\'s been long since I had these,  but somehow e portion seems like it got smaller. :/
Saut√©ed Mushroom Crepe!
üç≥ #marche #rosti #breakfast
Finally a feast here! Large cream of mushroom S$6.20 + very nice bread S$0.75
Crepe with creme br√ªl√©e ice cream and vanilla custard sauce. Topped with chocolate fudge. 
The fillings were great though I would prefer thin crusted pizzas.
This is actually thinly sliced potato. It is best taken when hot and dipped in mayonnaise.
A must try when visiting Marche, regardless which branch you go to.

üòä  The rosti is definitely something new to my tastebuds.  Marche serves Swedish food and rosti seems to be one of their featured ones.  There was a long queue for the rosti.  The rosti is actually shredded potato but it is very jelak.  Complement with the sour cream and lemon,  it did help a bit.  The snail sausage was something new too but I think it\'s smaller compared to the rest.  #marche #vivocity #dinner #rosti #sourcream #burpple #burpplesg #foodporn

Can\'t finish the half crispy pork knuckles myself. Dessert bar is almost empty so have to make do with blueberry #cheesecake as no one wanna share a #icecreamwaffle with me #burpple #dinner #lastnight #calories overload
#Pizzas are awesome for gatherings and shared among friends. What\'s the nicest pizza you had? Share with us at #foodreviewssg and #foodreviewsasia

Succulent meat! Yummy! Never thought pork loin could be so juicy! Very memorable...Marche has a different meaning for me now...will definitely be back for more!
Pure indulgence!

$17.90++. Thin and crispy crust. Not too cheesy.
The only potato I love to eat.
What happens when you cannot decide what to eat when at Vivo City? You go to Marche for their all time favourites such as rosti, calamari and crepe. Besides the food, I would like to show you all my new toy! The Revoltech Danboard Mini from Kaiyoo. Been wanting to get this for the longest time and I finally got it today after a shop was selling it at a discount! üòç

We woke up early today and we wanted to go wildwildwet, but weather did not permit us to go today. And we decided to hunt for dimsum buffet, then again it\'s all full house on a Saturday (family day I suppose). We couldn\'t decide where to for lunch, therefore we did Food Hopping today at March√© and Dian xiao Er! \n<br />#whitagram #foodstagram #foodporn #march√© #goodfood #happiness #saturdate #saturday #random #mykindofjoy #love #impromptudate
