THE chic places in Singapore to have tea? One foot in pollen and you know it! I wish I could rhapsodize about the afternoon tea selection but it had its hits and misses. Couldn\'t fault the open face sandwiches that were of right sizes to save space for sweets. Mediocre macaron, (overly sweet)tart and scone though. The bite size cakes were the well executed desserts, rich and moist! What\'s more if you need to digest all that? Take a walk around the flower dome where the restaurant is situated at (-: 
Afternoon cocktail sessions in the sun. The Dragonfly Mocktail is lychee juice based with a red chilli, lime juice and vanilla syrup. Took a little while to adjust to the chilli flavour in the drink, it wasn\'t really spicy, but I probably wouldn\'t have it again.\n<br />#Pollen #TheTerrace
Irish Coffee on a plate - Baileys ice cream, milk sponge cake, coffee curd and chocolate soil. I was pleasantly surprised at how all the components went so well together that I couldn\'t stop nodding my head as I ate! 
Poached duck, carrot puree, chicory, nuts and seed with a hoisin-like sauce which gave the dish a Chinese touch to it! The chicory has great charred taste and sweetness to it. Poached duck was tender as it was served at medium (to medium well there about) - a slight gamey taste if you\'re sensitive to it but the sauce helps to mask it! 
Roasted barramundi, mushroom and nori duxelle, baked celeriac with mushroom tea poured over. A good serving portion there and the fish came with a crispy skin! Downside was that the meat was slightly dry - thank goodness for the mushroom tea! 
Cured trout, dill tapioca, calamansi and sea herbs. A refreshing citrusy dish that whets your appetite! Love those fish roes which explodes upon biting. 
Stockyard beef tartare, saikyo miso, daikon, charcoal and garlic oil. To be honest, I\'m not a big fan of beef tartare due to it being a raw red meat. However, Pollen have seasoned it beautifully and took away the raw taste. Also, the charcoal oil and black pepper gives it a smokey flavor! 
.\n<br />|\n<br />An successful fusion dish by pollen which Japan meet Italy. While sitting in a 20degree garden for more than an hour, this bowl of warm broth was served. Light on the palate but warm at heart. The cavatelli pasta sat in a bowl of warm mushroom dashi broth. The poached egg helped to bind the earthiness, sweetness and savory together. It would be perfect if there were some bits of deep fried mushroom for texture.
|\n<br />After trying out their tasting menu and ala carte menu, we were disappointed by their starters but the experience got better after the 4th course. Some dishes didn\'t really worked for us but the meat dishes were great. .\n<br />|\n<br />Seared Venison with Mashed Parsnip. The light spiciness from the parsnip and fruity sourness from blue berry created prefect balance between gamy venison. Best dish of the night. .\n<br />|\n<br />Fantastic service and excellent view. Their dishes weren\'t exactly refine, so don\'t expect it to be a fine dinning restaurant. As long you stick with their main courses and plated desserts, you will definitely have a better time than ours. .\n<br />|\n<br />For the full course ➡️ http://www.jiaknonstop.com/restaurant/garden-by-the-bay-pollen-singapore
My first time having a pumpkin version of gnocchi, so I was just wondering where else can I get good gnocchi in Singapore?
Sour and saltiness from the ikura doesn\'t sound like a feasible combination, but it actually does wonders, really invigorating
But when served with hummus and cumin(my favourite mid-eastern dish ingredient), tarragon mustard seed butter, combination was amazing as heck
Mixed Berries, Cream Cheese and Hibiscus. Seemingly like a deconstructed Berry Cheesecake dessert; we were told by the wait staff that the berries were going to be sour and they indeed were, but the Hibiscus gelee within helped to balance things out a bit. What was really impressive was the Cream Cheese ice-cream; really rich and luscious, feeling really indulgent which helped to cut away the berry\'s sourness.
Coffee, Milk, Bailey\'s. This would really satisfy the coffee lovers out there; the coffee mousse was really strong, while complimented with light milk sponge cake and the smooth and rich ice-cream. While everything was well-executed, they could perhaps amp up the Bailey\'s in this one; I might not take drinks well but I definitely love indulging in strong alcoholic desserts any time!
Essentially a deconstructed Christmas turkey, this dish rings the holiday bells with familiar components such as the pork stuffing, raspberry sauce and turkey breast which brought out the flavour well. Each component is well-executed, but the way to enjoy this dish is to have a bit of everything in one go to get its intended flavour.
I usually don\'t order vegetarian options in such situations, but I am madly in love with this one; the gnocchi were chewy, but carried a hint of sweetness from the pumpkin used in the making of it. Enhancing the sweetness was the pumpkin purée on the side, while goat cheese was extremely pungent but went really well with its savoury flavour. Complimenting the whole dish with a crunch were crushed pistachio which also added a dimension of earthiness to it. This went so well, and I was going on and on and it just all ended too soon that I really, really craved for more.
Dill Tapioca, Calamansi, Sea Herbs. This was really indulging and addictive; the chunky bits of cured trout were so savoury, and combined well with the sweetness within this dish perhaps from the Calamansi. Ikura roe gives the dish an additional popping sensation which sends waves of umami flavour with every pop.
Black Radish, Oyster Emulsion, Wasabi. A rather enjoyable started with chunky bits of beef to chew on; not too gamey and a rather savoury starter.
The warm titular pears were resiliently crunchy and very juicy and moist, adaptively bearing the distinctive spiciness of the ginger cake which, by the way, would cling onto your tongue like an overzealous yet adorable koala. Elsewhere, the yogurt was like a cross between Llaollao and rich creamy vanilla, the granola wore glazed honey coats, and the chamomile cream kept the proceedings decidedly relaxed and teatime taitai-esque. 4.2/5
Rather precocious and precious a creation. The sugary and salty crumble had the rather mystical ability of soaking up the flavour essences of its surroundings, with the dry crumbs somehow harnessing the spirit of the classily restrained basil and the refreshingly energetic white peach sorbet, while elsewhere even the meringue shards tasted every bit their Nassim Hill-esque pedigree. 4/5
Beautiful edible art on a plate. Raw Hokkaido scallops with wasabi, dashi, apple, avocado. 
Pre-Christmas lunch earlier in the week with colleagues before the Christmas break. It\'s so cold in the restaurant, added to that wintery feel ❄️❄️❄️ Lovely ambience, beautiful view, good food, fizzy champagne - a visual delight. Dessert (Apple Pie) was a big disappointment though - was just bland frozen cream with meagre crumbs; go for the Black Forest Cake instead.
beautiful looking but taste wise can be better. Out of all the items, I only like the Bruschetta and the Scones. There is refillable coffee and Gryphon Tea. The good thing about dining there is u get complimentary assess to Flower Dome. 
#pollen at Gardens By the Bay has their own \"dry-aging\" mini room for meat. Which explains why the duck we had was so darn tasty.
This was one of the more interesting courses in Celebrity Chef Jason Atherton\'s Pollen degustation menu. I found the duck to have a unique taste as it had undergone a dry-aging process before being injected with flower extract. Quite apt seeing that the restaurant is located within the renowned Gardens By The Bay.
small banana bits, coconut milk balls, curry (???????!) ice cream. uhmmm methinks curry spices don\'t go with ice cream. the guys seemed to enjoy it though. 
shuttles between the visitor centre and pollen. website says every 5 minutes but we hardly waited a minute that day.
nice post lunch walk in the air conditioned flower dome is an added benefit
green apple purée, celery strips, kaffir lime sorbet, peanut paste. chef seems to be in a peanut phase. refreshing and light. reminiscent of a thai salad.
\"Squab Pigeon, braised leg, rhubarb, caramelized radicchio, golden raisins.\" yes!!!! order this!!!! fatty medium rare pigeon. doesn\'t look too pretty but tastes perfect. for a la carte, beef main ($78++, sorry no picture) with chicory (tastes like pesto. LOVE.) is another good choice. 
ok first off, I dislike chicken. most boring meat ever. this version.... peanut sauce really made it taste like satay. hahaa.
perfectly roasted, crispy skin, adorned with pancetta and drizzled in bacon consommé. I dislike fish but couldn\'t fault this. a bit hard to eat from a bowl though.
\"Back-to-front squid risotto, cauliflower, roasted squid consommé.\" basically squid in risotto sized grains ...inventive but didn\'t work for me as the squid was too tender to feel like risotto. and don\'t do this unless you are really into seafood. even for me it was really...  squidyyyy. 
like pâté but lighter. adorned w liquid nitrogen-ed foie gras nuggets &amp; earthy shiitake mushrooms. I liked the different textures, but haven\'t really come to terms with the temperature thing. 
pork rinds with apple mustard. a different take on pork with apple sauce but it was only average. pork rinds were not freshly fried &amp; crackling like Jane Thai\'s version with sambal belachan. lol.
deep fried rice n cheese balls. they were ok (who dislikes deep fried cheese anyway). 2 types of butter (seaweed, sesame) for complimentary sourdough bread. seaweed butter (green one) is the bomb ! especially if one can\'t get their hands on Le beurre aux algues Bordier.....
available daily. choices of main not awe-inspiring. chicken, fish or veggie. yawn.
This pudding is very different from the ordinary pudding. Firstly you are invited to sit at the desert bar where you can watch how the chef prepares your dessert. And the dessert is done like what\'s seen on cable. Frozen rice and corns by nitrogen etc. Plus this pudding has curry flavour on top of the sweet and acid taste. Excellent way to end an excellent dinner. 
Tender and juicy. What\'s more to say. Belly good. 
A very fine start to dinner. Every item helps open your palate ready for the main meal. 
Berries, goat cheese ice cream..strange combo u say ? 😜 this is the last of my bday lunch pics at Pollen .
How cute ! Tot I would try something different.. Beetroot sorbet is indeed special and the salty choco mousse went well with it .. Didn\'t quite like the bitter pure dark choco dots thou .
Dessert served on a stone ! The wait staff told us some diners tot it was a coconut ! 😂😂some tried to knock it with spoons 😄
💪 But unfortunately this high tea failed to impress. While some items were nice, others were merely average. Clotted cream appeared a little grainy and curdled. It was also rather tangy but apparently it\'s supposed to taste this way. The server insisted it was clotted cream but I\'m pretty sure it tasted more like creme fraiche or even whipped sour cream. No thanks, I like my cream smooth, thick, and full. (Not a euphemism I swear.) Out of the savouries, the minced beef croquette was my favourite. The mushroom and chicken tart and smoked salmon multigrain sandwich were a bit of a letdown. Egg sandwich was pleasant though. Out of the sweets, I like the chocolate marshmallow tart the best. Macaron was really average and tasted artificial. And please, no fruit in my scones! 😤 #antifruitsconecamp
And another... #burpple #pollensg
It was buttery, melt-in-your-mouth awesome. Don’t forget to have a quick pop by to the Flower Dome upstairs since entry is already covered by your meal. 😋😋😋

Cucumber sorbet and Chinese celery granita in gin syrup covered with a meringue made of dried cucumber skin. It is very unusual to be served cucumber and celery as dessert. I had my doubts initially but @iakkai42 who served us the dish assured us that we will like it. He was absolutely right, the combination of cucumber and salary with slightly sweetened gin syrup was excellent. Who would have thought a strong tasting vegetable like celery could be made into a dessert?\n<br />*\n<br />There is a story behind the creation of this unique dessert. The team was struggling with sourcing fresh fruits at the local Taiwan market when a typhoon hit and were left with only these vegetables. Amazing how a little challenge can bring out the best in a team. Loved this creative dessert 😍.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_pollen #pollenxmume #pollensg #mumetaiwan #sanpelegrino #acquapanna #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Seasonal vegetables, all prepared in different ways (fried, roasted, fresh etc) to create different textures and tastes, with fermented black beans.

Seasoned with Taiwanese preserved daikon and served with pickled onion, confit egg yolk, shrimp oil, clam mayonnaise and lotus crumble. This dish was an amazing play of colours, textures and tastes. Loved the crunch in the dish too. Really amazing.\n<br />*\n<br />I think @richie_lin, @long_xiong and @iakkai42 are really talented. I first heard about @mume_taiwan  when I was dining at Den in Tokyo, then through @little_meg_siu_meg\'s posts (big fan of hers) and again when they made their debut in Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants. When @nantheless said she had an amazing meal at an 8 hands collab #pollenxmume, I immediately booked for the next night 😊. Thanks @nantheless! I didn\'t even know @mume_taiwan was in town.\n<br />*\n<br />I would really like to dine at @mume_taiwan some day. All I have to do now is plan a trip to Taiwan 😂!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_pollen #pollensg #mumetaiwan #pollenxmume #sanpelegrino #acquapanna #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

These were absolutely amazing!\n<br />*\n<br />Chicken liver pate with beetroot jelly on toasted brioche. I am typically not a fan of chicken liver but this had just the right taste and texture in an umami mouthful.\n<br />*\n<br />If I thought the first amuse bouche was amazing, the second one completely blew me away. Corn puree with crabmeat dressed in vinaigrette on quinoa toast topped with osmanthus. Truly amazing!\n<br />*\n<br />What a wonderful way to start our meal. @nantheless thank you so much for recommending this 8 hands collaboration dinner between Pollen and Mume. \n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_pollen #pollensg #pollenxmume #mumetw #sanpellegrino #acquapanna #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Would be perfect if served with raw egg yolk😁
Cream cheese was a really creamy, full-bodied ice cream, absolutely enjoyed it
Served warm, these little buns were light and fluffy and oozes cheese when bit upon, starting the meal with a little surprise.
Pretty good.
These balls of risotto are way too good to be given away as starters. \n<br />#pollensg #burpple
Who knew little breaded balls of an excellent risotto could bring so much joy?
