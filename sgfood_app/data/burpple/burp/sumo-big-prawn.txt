Tried the most expensive Big Prawn Noodles I have eaten and found this bowl to be really cholesterol rich. The clams and Prawn broth taste extremely flavourful and you can definitely appreciate the longs hours of prawn shells simmered in the soup. The ingredients are really generous, justifying the $8 I paid for it. I think it\'s the best soup base Prawn noodles I have tried!
Telling ourselves the same excuse of \"might as well since we\'re already here\", we shared a huge bowl of crayfish which I personally think can be shared by 2 hungry people (or even 3). The crustacean flavour was unquestionably strong and the generous amount of onion and garlic also made it even tastier. Though the crayfish were rather small and the yellow mee was a tad overcooked, it was one satisfying bowl to have (but maybe not so if there\'s a snaking queue).
Soup was tasty. You don\'t taste the salty taste but the natural freshness of the seafood taste.\n<br />My Tasty Lobster Beehoon for $29.90\n<br />The La La I never get to bite a tiny bit of Sand which was amazing. Hate those La La that\'s not washed clean and you bite the sandy sandy clams 😖.\n<br />The Lobster &amp; Prawns are both Fresh. Meat is Springy.\n<br />You don\'t get to see black stuffs on the lobster or prawns like those that\'s not fresh.\n<br />Overall experience 9/10 😋😋😋\n<br />Q was pretty fast too. \n<br />Great Job Guys
(Sorry for the poor picture quality) Finally tried the Sumo Prawn Noodle near my house.(literally a 300m walk? Heehee) They only had the $8 option left, which is the jumbo prawn noodle. I had beehoon soup, which came with 3 jumbo prawns, and 13 lalas. The broth is real tasty, with garlic chips and chilli powder adding to the kick. The seafood was fresh too. Quite a satisfying bowl of noodles, but I won\'t queue for it😂 Luckily, I didn\'t have to as I went there at 620pm.
Love this! Soup is deep in its crustacean flavour without being overly salty, with really fresh lobsters and prawns.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Soup - strong in crustacean flavour, and not salty. Some have said that the soup lacks strength, but I made a distinction between the strength of the crustacean flavour and umami strength from msg. We concluded that any umami present here came from the seafood and none from MSG. Major plus points for it.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Seafood - Really fresh. Lobsters could be easily removed from its shell with a light pull using chopsticks. Prawns were large, and though not as tender as the Gold Standard of prawns at Wah Kee, they were still sweet. Clams were also plump and sweet.\n<br />🔸\n<br />If you find $29.90 too expensive, go for the $8 version with 3 prawns and clams. The soup is also robust and we think it\'s really worth it. #BurppleAMKHawkers 
The prawn noodles! Q was really long when we arrive but in less than 30min our prawn noodles ready liao👍👍 the 小鲜肉 is very fast 🙊. Of cos BIG thanks to Gerald Gor Gor for Q-ing😁. Sadly, didn\'t get to try Lobster and crayfish... both sold out and no beehoon 😔 Their soup is superb!! Eventhough they are officially close at 9pm,  it was all sold out at 8.15pm. So please go early...
crazy long queue on a sunday late morning but worth it!! not cheap for hawker food but really high quality seafood and good soup chubby and i were both satisfied ☺️
The longest line in the hawker centre after 1pm for a stall with minimum spending of $5 - the people know what\'s up. For a premium hawker centre price of $24.90, you get fresh seafood - an entire lobster, two big prawns and many lala clams (they must be serving up thousands of these clams a day!). Just imagine the sweetness of the broth... it takes 45mins to get it, you pile on the cholesterol, but heck it\'s worth it
It came with 6 halves crayfish together with generous portion of clams. The soup was very rich in seafood taste. ❤ \n<br />High cholesterol in this meal though...\n<br />@yanchien_ IPPT not so soon but ya 🏃🌚\n<br />#sgfood #burpple #sumobigprawnnoodle #vsco
Good food don\'t need no HQ pictures. For real, for real. The moment you know it\'s good food, you don\'t even take time to take a decent photo and actually get down as soon as possible to savour this bowl of sweet wholesomeness. 
Much publicity on social media lately that I have to go personally grade this 😬😬😬 Extreme long queue were there to greet me on this wet Saturday morning.... the long wait had me salivating while contemplating what to savor on the menu!!! Price tag of $24.90 for its premier Lobster Noodles is unheard of considering serving from a neighborhood hawker centre. One full Columbia Lobster, 2 big prawns and loads of pipis. Sweet soup based with fried garlic floating above. Whatever style you choose, be it prawns, crayfish, lobsters all come with the same soup based. I personally feel the chef had been slightly generous on the 花雕酒 portion hence making the soup a little bitter at the end. I salute the entrepreneurship of the young owner for this extremely daring price tag. Conclusion: similarly to White Seafood Beehoon or Wen Wen Prawn Noodles at Geylang Bahru, traditionally prawn noodles transformation. Yumminess 3.5/5 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Soup is good, ingredients are fresh, chili is perfect. Worth the queue and cholesterol.
Ultimate umami moment with this Columbia Lobster Beehoon Soup (1 lobster, 2 prawns, lots of clams) and Crayfish Beehoon Soup (3 crayfish, lots of clams). Fresh and meaty lobster and crayfish made the 40 minutes wait on a Sunday 5pm worthwhile. Soup was very sweet from the generous amount of crustacean used and lots of garlic to bring out the flavor!

The price tag was definitely hefty for hawker centre but I guess still pretty worth as we are talking about an entire lobster here. \n<br />Be prepared to wait in queue for at least an hour over the weekends as that was what I did before landing myself a bowl. At least the broth didn\'t disappoint - imagine your usual Prawn Mee soup but richer, more of that umami-ness and you can taste more dimension with the interesting addition of chinese wine! \n<br />After my visit, I say go for the Crayfish bowl ($13) instead (3 whole crayfish, prawns and clams!!) for more bang for your buck!
How is it even possible!\n<br />🔅\n<br />Price is already below expectation and quality just up the dish even more. Be surprised at the light broth made from prawn shells and pork ribs, not too much of a prawn-driven taste, but its complements well with some sweetness from the seafood.\n<br />🔅\n<br />See more at http://sethlui.com/sumo-big-prawn-noodle-singapore/ to know more about how Sumo can actually handle selling all these and droolsome photos of the crazily scrumptious lobster bee hoon bowls!\n<br />🔅\n<br />🙌@pickleboyz\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋Sumo Bug Prawn Noodle Soup\n<br />💰$24.90, Usual $18.90\n<br />🍴Blk 628 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 #01-72, Singapore 560628 ⏲Opening Hours: Daily 8:30AM-9PM\n<br />☎️Tel: 9299 2621
Ang Mo Kio is not exactly near my hood. But curiosity had always been a great pull to take the road less travelled.\n<br />I ordered the all crayfish and clams noodle. A huge bowl with generous portion of beehoon mixed with yellow mee. 3 crayfishes n lotsa clams. Broth did not have the prawny flavor. It is sweet and flavorful. Crayfish was cooked upon order so it tasted fresh.  This is not your typical hae mee. A bit on the milder side but still retained that unaminess from the various seafood absorbed into the broth.\n<br />So would I go back for it again? Not unless I have a reason to be in that part of the island.
Cuz the fragrance from the robust soup floated to me while queuing. Full of crustacean flavours and less of other spices and condiments. Comes with 4 jumbo sized prawns and la la clams. Not your usual prawn Mee.
I am lucky to experience it during my impromptu leave today. Crowd is already building up after I ordered during late afternoon. Ordered Lobster noodle soup and it comes with clams, Columbia Lobster and prawn. Noodles is cooked separately and mixed with the ingredients later. Lobster is added in with the base broth and cooked later which makes it sweeter. Furthermore, it does not contain MSG. Prawn is big and not overcooked. Clams are well washed with no sand, fleshy and juicy.  Usual price is $18.90 with Asian lobster. I supposed Columbia lobsters will be served when asian lobsters are out of stock. There is an additional charge of $6 for the columbia lobsters.\n<br />#sumobigprawn #07102016 #foodporn #burpple #sgfood
$18.90 for a bowl of noodles in a market food centre? YES BECAUSE THERE\'S A WHOLE LOBSTER IN THERE (plus shells and prawns)! The broth didn\'t disappoint and will satisfy all sorts of crustacean cravings. It was garlicky, sweet from the fresh seafoods and packed with umami goodness - just imagine the beehoon soaking up all these rich flavours, mmm hmm! 
It\'s been a long time since I visited this market, which is the market of my childhood. This stall run by young hawkers caught my eye and I am SO glad I tried it. The soup was super sweet and rich from the addition of clams to the stock. Paid $8 for a bowl of the big prawn noodles, and it came with 4 plump and fresh big prawns, clams and some pork belly (no limp slices of blanched lean pork here!). Even the $5 bowl of normal prawn noodles would be satisfying enough cos man, that soup is SO good. They also had crayfish and lobsters on display, and I saw plenty of people tucking into the lobster noodles with much gusto. So pleased to see young hawkers succeeding - you know it\'s good when aunties and uncles queue up for you in a market already filled with good food 💯
》$15
Accidental picture, idea for posting. Family ran out of ideas for eats at this time of day, so I suggested this market so I can finally try the #sumobigprawnnoodle. This is the $5 #prawnnoodlesoup #beehoonsoup portion. Still generous with the #seafood, and lovely soft #beehoon. The soup is very flavourful but not sweet though. Not bad if you\'re in the area (inconvenient location) and there\'s no queue. #prawnnoodles
I\'d the Jumbo Big Prawn Bee Hoon Soup ($8). Crayfish one is at $15 while the lobster one starts @ $24.90.

I will be back after losing the calories gained. 😋 damn shiokkkkk. Must try! I hope they can maintain their standard and price. Drank up every single drops of the soup left from the bowl. Lobster noodle $24, big prawn noodle $8. Their ingredients very fresh and sweet. 😍 even chilli sauce is nice. Lala are of good quality too, meaty. Went around 6+ pm and queue around 15mins. Not bad, i dun mind queuing longer (anyway some1 queue while i am sitting down) 😆. #hawkerfoodSG #foodsg #burpple #igsg #lobster #prawns #seafood #shiok1

The stall commanded a consistent long queue after its recent hype, despite having to pay $24.90 for a lobster prawn beehoon. \n<br />As the colour spoke of itself, the soup had a very rich crustacean flavour comparable to that of a lobster or prawn bisque. Prawns and lala were fresh but the lobster was overcooked and meat was tough. \n<br />Enjoyed the soup we certainly did although we felt that this belonged to the \"tick-in-the-box\" category that we probably wouldn\'t return for. Perhaps it was its cost, or overall standard, or simply b\'cos we\'d prefer the complete package including the dining ambience to enjoy something of such value. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #hawkersg #lobster #burpproved #seafoodbeehoon
Well all I can say is to get in line and you will be rewarded with a bowl of umami broth and huge prawns that can definitely rival the many established ones in Singapore. Priced at $8 for the big prawns noodle soup option, you get 4 prawns that are almost the size of my palms, putting those miserly sliced ones to shame, Japanese clams, noodles and that irresistible broth. Spiked with lots of garlic, the broth was so good that I wiped it out clean.\n<br />•\n<br />Sumo Big Prawn\n<br />Address: 628, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, Unit 01-72, Singapore 560628 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock #sumobigprawn
Lol!! 1st birdie... visited a friend. 2nd birdie... very early lunch. 3rd birdie... a hop skip &amp; jump to the nearby cafe.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />So this is the recently much raved about big prawn noodle soup. As you can see, my bowl has no prawns. I ordered the crayfish bowl with plentiful clams. Well, because I noticed the prawns were already cooked and just a matter of throwing it in the broth. Then I was told, miss, u have to wait slightly longer for your bowl. The reason being the crayfish were cooked upon order. Tada... fresh!\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />Noticed how white the flesh is. Anyway, the young chef was quite nice lor... when it was ready, he smiled at me (which he did not to other customers) and apologised (twice) for making me wait cos afew ppl after me got their bowls. 🔼🔼\n<br />3 crayfishes &amp; many clams. The broth was a little mild, not so much of a prawny flavor, but sweet and packed with umaminess. It was not an hour wait but only about 20 mins. So I am quite happy with killing 3 birdies with one ezlink card by mrt.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />Would I go back there? Only if I have a  good reason to be in that part of the island.
There are a lot of 3 crayfish, 2 big prawns and la la clams.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #uncagestreetfood #tigerbeer #crayfish #prawnnoodles #prawnmee
There is even la la clams and tiger prawns in it. The broth is rich and flavoursome, super shiok.

Looks like a new venture by Young hawkers. Slightly pricey at $24.90. Broth is excellent with garlicky taste, lobster overcooked abit hard. Likely to be better with experience gained day by day. Worth a shot at least! 😋 #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sginstafood #igsg #igsgfood #nomnomsg #foodphotography #sgnomnom #sgfoodgasm #foodstagram #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #foodie #whati8today #foodporn #eatoutsg #burpple #burpplesg #hungrygowhere #jiaklocal #recommended #sghawker #hawkerpedia #hawker #angmokio #dinner #blk628
A new and upcoming Prawn Noodle Soup in AMK. Broth was robust and pack with solid prawn flavours. Nice touch with the clams as it create their own unique flavour profile. 😋😋\n<br />.\n<br />🔽\n<br />Run by young entrepreneurs, this stall also offer lobster prawn noodle and crayfish prawn noodle as well. We will definitely go back to try those.
