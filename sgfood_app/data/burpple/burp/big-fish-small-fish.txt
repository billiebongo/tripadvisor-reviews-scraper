Another is Salmon but we didn\'t order.. *Note: All Mains comes Freshly Sliced Potato Crisps!* They are so generous with their potato crisps, check out the portion they gave for 1 Main! We also add on Cheese Sauce [$3] and it was served pipping hot!!!! It\'s different from the free flow Cheese you get from the sauce station.. this pipping hot Cheese is yummmmnsss.. Seabass is quite a big whole piece, well fried such that it\'s crispy and not over crispy nor burnt! Seabass with hot Cheese 😍💋 Fantastic Combo!!! I Guess we were full from the potato crisps they served before our Mains come so 1 Mains is just nice for the two of us! Seats might be an issue if you have a big group or during meal time.. Also be prepared to wait for 40 mins to an hour during peak period! We waited about 40 mins for our Mains but all I could say, ITS WORTH IT!! Worth the calories! SLURPSSSS! Highly recommended! ❤️❤️❤️@bigfishsmallfishsg #bigfishsmallfish #bigfishsmallfishsg #punggoltebing #punggolcontainer #punggolcontainerbistro

Oh my goshhhh, sinfully good! All the chips and fish makes the flavour very very strong, do note that it can be a little dry due to all the deep fried goodness so get a bunch of sauce at the side or drinks! 🍺\n<br />•\n<br />Located at Punggol Container Cafe, it will cost you ($6.90) 💸 •\n<br />Follow us for more Singapore food recommendations and hashtag #thegrowingbelly to share your meals with us!! 👍🏻\n<br />•\n<br />#fishnchips #fishandchips #foodphotography #singaporefood

Choose your main from the options of dory, yellow fin, red tilapia, sea bass, salmon and fresh red snapper.\n<br />Then pick one sauce from XO, cheese, salted egg yolk and tartar to complete your order.\n<br />You will then be greeted by a bright, yellow box with your batter and freshly sliced potatoes that are fried till its texture is pretty much like potato chips. \n<br />The light, airy batter is incredibly crispy and its neither greasy nor dripping with oil even though its served right from the fryer.\n<br />As you slowly carve apart the batter, you will be enticed by the pearl white fish nestled within. Its flesh is so juicing sweet and amazingly delicate that you will be craving for more.\n<br />Will definitely be back to try the other mains and their add ons such as calamari, churros and chocolate lava cake.
Tasted more like Pandan Churros but still pretty good. 昨晚（晚餐後）跑去才剛開張三天的大魚小魚吃炸魚薯片😍 在貨櫃裡用餐的概念很吸引人。食物又好吃，一定會再去光顧。唯一顧慮是下午烈日下，呵呵，不就是烤爐嗎😂
