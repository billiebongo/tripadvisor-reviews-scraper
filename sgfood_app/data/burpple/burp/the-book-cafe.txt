What\'s better than a cup of delicious vanilla milkshake on a lazy Saturday/Sunday morning. Please read my full review at http://xiaoyangmeimei.blogspot.sg/2014/03/the-book-cafe.html
The Book Cafe is one of those hidden gems with the perfect ambience for work. Although it\'s a tad inaccessible, you\'ll be ensured a quiet and comfortable environment with excellent service that will make you feel at home. Complete with plush couches and good lighting, their simple yet satisfying food and coffee will not disappoint.
Wow by the \"Egg Royale\" served here.. Really good üëçüëç and cuppa good too.. ;)
Nice environment n food.. although the minestrone soup n the art of latte slightly dissatisfied.. but ok laa
Well.. nice environment.. food also nice.. but the minestrone soup slightly disappointed üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Trying to make up for all my YOLO meals for the past 2 weeks! &gt;
Very cosy, great to bring your book/laptop along. Staff are really friendly. Nice n affortable menu. 
The ambience was calm and soothing, most of the customers were either reading books or surfing on the net with the free wifi in the cafe. Price was reasonable for most items on the menu :) Definitely worth a visit if you are interested in cafes or just want a soothing ambience to do your work ^^
The ambience and character of the Book Cafe was really nice. Loved the fact that there were options of either sitting on the comfy sofas or on proper tables and chairs. The power outlets were a huge plus! Went at about 3 pm and I could sit, read and catch up on some work all the way till 7 without feeling pressurised to leave. Nice! Food looked really nice, though the taste was pretty normal. All in all, a really nice place to just chill. 
This place is bustling even on a weekday afternoon, lots of people on their laptop, or just enjoying a leisurely meal or cup of coffee with friends. Lighting is very dim indoors though.
Tea bag with a \"seedling\" growing out from its top, even the teapot has a special opening on the lid for the \"leaf\" to peek through. Cute.
Today\'s special fix made by owner : )
Smoked turkey, avocado, egg white and grilled tomatoes in ciabatta bun. 
Fluffy, light as air and melt in the mouth!! Hits the spot very time!!
Nati Banana with ice cream and chocolate drizzle! Thailand still has the best Roti banana pancakes in the world!
Strawberry Flan dessert for my dear friend from Thailand
Nati Banana... Thick crispy toast, bananas, ice cream and choc sauce... Yummy but too much toast. $10.50++ not particularly worth it... But refreshing... #burpple
A cup of hot cocoa that always soothes the soul and never goes wrong
Chocolate Banana cake was decadent! But if only there\'s more banana! üçå
Checking out the Library Caf√© at Martin Road! There\'s a full list of All-Day Breakfast menu and I can\'t resist to order an Eggs Benedict with Ham and Rosti!
Located at the quieter end of Robertson Quay, it\'s a good spot, away from all the noise of the city. But the cafe is small and chances are that it will be full on a weekend afternoon. 
Awesome poached eggs that are not over-cooked. And I like the bacon which is coated with maple syrup! Unlike the too-salty-for-my-liking bacons that are served in most cafes/restaurants, I think their bacon is really good (: The rosti is not bad too.
Hazelnut cake with a crunchy base. One will only know how nice it is after trying it.      Price: $6.95
A very creamy pasta that tastes different from the usual cream pasta that is sold anywhere else. For the cream lovers.      Price: $17.95
Ice cocoa with marshmallows, definitely a good alternative to replace the usual coffee.           $5.95
Grill chicken topped with bacon and cheese, serve along with special sauce. Mashed potato by the side simply balance out the whole dish. Very delicious. Definitely a must try!           Price: $18.95
Really good lemon cake. Tip: do not order a chocolate drink and then eat this after, the cake will taste like chicken
Would recommend the chocolate milkshake if you want a creamy taste. This iced cocoa is rather strong on the cocoa. Not bad!
This creamy chocolate milkshake is awesome! Try this if you are in the mood for milky, creamy chocolate drinks 
Eggs were perfectly poached with delicious smoked salmon. Clearly a favourite among consumers here
The sandwich would be better with some sauce as it tasted a tad dry. Overall it is a healthy meal and the sauce on the salad was not bad 
Need my daily caffeine today. The flat white is quite good.
The Book Cafe isn\'t exactly easily accessible, but its extensive brunch menu, and its consistency in food quality are the drawing factors for its regulars. A veteran in the cafe industry, it has definitely lived up to the expectations of its customers with its hearty, satisfying dishes. If you are a beginner in cafes, The Book Cafe should be your first stop. FYI, it\'s also one of the few places Burpple co-founder Elisha, loves to work from.
Egg yolk that melts in your mouth, nicely toasted English muffin &amp; crispy browned rosti. 
The muffins underneath those eggs and salmon are the best I ever tasted.
Too chill to work here. Chose to sit at the tables instead.
Closed till 31 Dec 17

The name says it all, The Book Cafe. Many books to keep you occupied. Simple, relaxing ambience, has couch/sofa area too. Read a book or do some work. Power point are readily available around the table area to power up your laptop. There\'s alfresco seating too.\n<br />Wide selection of food from all day breakfast to sandwich/burger, pasta, shibuya thick toast and etc! Food was good, had a Egg Royale Benedict (Salmon). The smoked salmon portion is generous and come with rosti, unlike the usual salad.\n<br />Location may be a little off but it is quite crowded on a Monday morning. \n<br />A nice place to visit again and again...

WTF. So I have blacklisted smitten cafe and went ahead with book cafe begrudgingly, because I didn\'t have a good experience the last time I visited the cafe because it was full house and relegated to the seats outside. But I must say having found a seat inside, I don\'t want to leave the cafe. Food and coffee are good too! #bookcafe #ftw #workfromcafe #brunch
Eggs royale with pancakes üç≥üçûüç¥üç∂
Tempting looking yet average passable latte.
Love the smoked salmon together with the hollandaise sauce!

And they have WiFi.. the eggs royale is awesome.. though I can\'t finish it by myself.. lol #thebookcafe #sg #singapore #cafehopping #cafestovisitinsg #cafehunting #cafe #coffee #latte #eggsroyale #burger #cheeseburger #bookcafe #burpple
My all time favourite, although it\'s too much milk today
Cheesy and gratifying, what else is left to say üòÅ
Juicy, moist and delectably classic 
Yummy and light on the tummy = bliss
Monday Brunch.
A good cup of tea on a rainy sunday and a good catch up. Perfect way to spend a sunday. #lategram#organic#tea#sunday
Coffee not strong and lacked the desired aroma.
Italian lemon &amp; Pine nut pie. #desserts
‚ù§ Coffee
Latte... $5.50++ Pretty weak coffee, no aroma, ratio weakens the coffee even more in such a large cup and milk was over steamed. I think the main drawing factor of this place are the large comfy sofas and range of reading materials. Pricey cafe food. Not particularly worth the quality. #burpple #coffeeandcravings
People Love Us On Burpple! Burpple sticker spotting :)
