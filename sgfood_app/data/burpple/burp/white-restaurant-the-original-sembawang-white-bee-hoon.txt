The highly-raved white beehoon - still nice but definitely not as good as the original one in Sembawang. Still a good option if Sembawang is too far as it definitely stands out in comparison with wet beehoon from other tzechar places.
Loveeee the broth of the white bee hoon and never enough of it!  The meat &amp; seafood roll was nasty too with vegs and prawns in it but the supposedly popular home made fried Beancurd was such a disappointment ): tasted jus like flour with fish cake 
Favourite flavourful white bee hoon by the waterfront. Haezor here doesn\'t seem as nice as the one I had at Sembawang. Skip the Salted Egg Sotong though, the salted egg was not bad but Sotong was a little too tough. 
I can\'t believe I took sooo long to try this...but I am still not too late. 
The White Bee Hoon is the one that brought us here to Punggol Settlement branch. The soup is strong in flavour, like hokkien prawn mee without too much prawn taste and just bee hoon no noodle. The meat and seafood roll is another signature dish. More meaty than the normal wu xiang. The chicken wing is also recommended dish but i feel it is just normal prawn paste chicken wing. Nothing special with the yam ring. Nice but normal. It is a nice eatery with reasonable zi char pricing. However i would avoid weekend dining hours especially on PH or festive occasions. The quene is super long. The taste is not special enough to quene that long for it. Will return when i have craving for nice bee hoon hor fan on weekday.
[Punggol] East-siders can finally rejoice as we do not need to travel to Sembawang for the famous Sembawang White Beehoon (since rebranded to White Restaurant to dignify its uniqueness and heritage) as they have recently opened a branch at The Punggol Settlement. The famous dish, Original White Beehoon ($6/$10/$15), is a homely dish that was created by the founder, Mr Tay. It was also mentioned that over the years, there were numerous contenders but none able to match the one from White Restaurant. Hence, this calls for a visit to try this iconic dish. When the beehoon came, it looked like any other normal looking zi char dish. Price is slightly on the higher side and I have heard of long queues of people willing to wait for more than an hour just to get a table at the main outlet. However, within minutes, the entire plate was wiped clean and all the hype was clearly justified. I think that the superior stock which the chef uses contained certain magic or potion as after soaking the beehoon in it, it absorbs the essence, making it super flavourful with the distinctive wok hei. After your meal, take a walk down The Punggol Settlement which resembles East Coast Park, with the similar row of seafood restaurants by the sea.

White bee hoon, homemade tofu, meat and seafood roll and sweet potato leaves. Yums! Good ambience too. #tingzieeats #burpple

A closer look at the white bee hoon, lots of veg and some seafood, wet white gravy with bee hoon. So what\'s the hype?
Wasn\'t very impressed, slightly dry with the chili sauce, and more of meat and no or little trace seafood.
Flavorful stock and delicious bee Hoon (and I hate bee hoon usually). Anyways.. This time @ausomeawedrey @ahbenar and I got Pangsehed by the person (@jessicachanyh ) who jioed us out for this outing.üò©üò©üò©üò© #burpple
First time trying this popular dish and I agree it\'s delicious, but not quite worth the one-hour wait for a table, especially when the other menu offerings which we had (signature fried tofu and salted egg prawns) were substandard.
The famous white beehoon has landed in Punggol! Situated at the Punggol Settlement along with numerous seafood restaurants, be expected to wait on weekends. They have an automated queue system in place like Wild Honey or Dancing Crab! The beehoon had a starchy sauce holding the noodles together, but it was light enough which makes it enjoyable! The ngoh hiang was quite good too as they had crunchy chestnuts in it. The beehoon was nice but I\'m not sure if I\'ll queue for it!
Now at punggol settlement! 
Punggol residents take note: The Original Sembawang White Beehoon has now invaded The Punggol Settlement under the name called The White Restaurant. Opened in 1998 at Sembawang Road, You Huak Restaurant that had been famous for its white beehoon had opened its second outlet at Punggol since Jan 2015. Menu is largely similar as the coffeeshop-style outlet, though prices have increased in this brand new air conditioned restaurant with a few outdoor seats. Their signatures include the Signature White Beehoon (duh!) and Signature Meat and Prawn Roll, dishes that you would definitely find on every table there. Standards are identical or even parallel to their first outlet, so you could get the very best of the north now at the north-east. Those who live around Punggol and had always travelled to Sembawang for You Huak should head down, while those who hadn\'t tried would need to make a visit to taste and believe! 
Fried crisp on the exterior yet smooth and foamy inside, this dish was decent but felt like something was missing. Perhaps because the tofu was a mix of egg with vegetables, it tasted as though it was like a wanton missing of meat which tricks the tastebuds and the accompanying mayo did nothing to enhance the taste. Would have loved it more if it was paired with the Thai-style Chili that came with the Hae Zhor.
A lot of places serve those uninspiring, dry and oily omelettes. White Restaurant\'a version was really different; moist inside that it even felt a wee bit liked scrambled within. Prawns were also fresh and seemed to be different from the ones served in the beehoon
Simple tzechar dishes but The White Restaurant makes it a really defining one for me. Crunchy stalls of broccoli cooked in a light yet rich sauce with scallops that is not a single bit rubbery with mushrooms served alongside. How to not love this?
Beancurd skin wrapped with pork and prawns deep-fried before serving. This never disappoint; crisp and well-filled with meat so it\'s all that porky goodness with a bit of springiness from the prawn. And it\'s less oily than the ones at You Huak ;)
I have had high expectations of this dish because I visit the outlet at Sembawang on a regular basis, but The White Restaurant had hit all the spots right. Beehoon was springy despite doused in huge amounts of gravy that was similar to Mui Fan gravy that was light and clean-tasting, and came with the usual egg, squid, prawn and vegetables. If anything was bothering the dish it would be the overcooked prawns, which had always been this way at the Sembawang outlet all the while.

ÁôΩÁ±≥Á≤â, I finally have my share! üòã #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg

.\n<br />The bee hoon answer to hokkien mee. Solid and robust broth, nicely absorbed by springy bee hoon. The egg, prawn and squid are cooked just right. Those sambal lover, their belachan is just powerful.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #whiterestaurant #whiterestaurant #whitebeehoon #igsg #igsgfood #igsgfoodie #sgig #sgigfood #burpple #instafood_sg #instafoodsg #hungrygowhere #openricesg
