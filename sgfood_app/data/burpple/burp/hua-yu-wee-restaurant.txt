Had been to this restaurant a few times before and I am a fan of their Chilli Crab. It has both a sweet and spicy taste to it and it is really addictive. Would recommend people to this restaurant! However do make reservations before hand
Must come early. It\'s always packed üëç #singapore #restaurant #burpple - Hua Yu Wee
This needs to order in advance or you will be disappointed they dont accept on the spot order.
Specially ordered for mom.  Restaurant was honest, advised this would be ordered from outsourced.  It\'s really good, just needed a little more roasted will be crispier on the skin.
To beat the crowd next week, we had Mother\'s Day dinner earlier by a week (our usual practise),
Mother\'s Day.  Fish is a big thumbs up but too small for 10 of us.
Old school seafood at its best. A real gem of a find along Upper East Coast road. Over 50 years in business, this place offers affordable seafood over a relaxed family environment. You can choose to dine indoors (with a/c) or outdoors. The carpark is always packed so do come early or late if you\'re walking in.
Sri Lankan chilli crabs done well in this 50ish year old establishment. Really flavorful chilli sauce that works perfectly with the fried buns. 
This dish is simply fantastic. A definite highlight of the meal. Silver fish was crispy yet soft, with a tinge of crunch with every bite. Flavors were bright and appetizing. A must try! 
Which is your favorite??\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Crabs crabs crabs and more crabs. This is \"crabgasm\"! Chilli crabs my classic fave. Quite an old school flavor. The spice, the sweet and the tangy, the eggy gravy and the chunky umami flesh. Cute mini xiao mantous for bungee jumping into the gooey gravy. Can\'t behave like a lady whilst \"crabbing\". A proven statement of \"finger licking\" good!!\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />This restaurant has been around for the longest time. A colonial house with a rustic charm. A wonderful crabby meal!! #seafood #chillicrabs #hungrygowhere #igers #restaurantsg #stfoodtrending #sgig #openricesg #8dayseat #bloggers #burpple #straitstimesfood #instagood #instafoodsg #photographers #jiaklocal #foodgasm #photooftheday #sgfood #oldschool #tripadvisor #visitsingapore #exploresingapore #huayuwee #singaporeinsiders

Can\'t remember the exact name of this veggie, but the sauce\'s really addictive and goes really well with the soft veggie.
New dish recommendation - banana scallop fried with yam. Unique dish which tasted somewhat like a mini yam ball. It\'s served one each, and costs SGD4 for one.
(Comparable to Jumbo MeeGoreng in our opinion lar) Ho Jiak!üëçüèª #restaurantisalwaysbusy #huayuweerestaurant #bedok #sgeats #sgfoodblogger #stfood #foodsg #eatoutsg #sgfoodie #foodphotography #stfood #stfoodtrending #sgfoodpics #fuji #sgmakandiary #8dayseat #sgfood #meegoreng #seafood #chinesefood #tzechar #yummyfood #burpple #mycameraeatsfirst #sgfoodies
