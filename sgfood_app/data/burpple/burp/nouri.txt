First part of main course and punching way above it\'s diminutive portion size is the ceviche-esque kinilaw assembled from fennel vinegar-cured grouper with peppercorn brine, cultured Sarawak green pepper, wild ginger and coconut oil. The masterful balance of acid, sweet, sour and salty flavours cannot be denied. That it comes topped with two gorgeous hunks of crispy lard is merely icing on the (fish) cake.
Originally brought by African slaves to Chef Ivan Brehm\'s motherland of Brazil, the Acarajé is everything you could ask for in a fritter – cracklingly crunchy on the outside and the white pinto bean blend within is smooth, creamy and sweet. The fritter sits in a pool of vatapá bread and prawn curry which is in turn encircled by a turmeric curry. Both are excellent and complement the fritter well.
A triumph of umami, savour the sweetest, most succulent crab topped with pickled lettuce heart. The frothy soy and golden chive emulsion when eaten together with the lardo reminded me of a milder yet still flavourful Hokkien  prawn noodle broth.
If nothing else, Chef Ivan Brehm\'s \"crossroads cuisine\" is certainly experimental and innovative, melding hyperlocal ingredients with European technique and influences from across the globe.
This was amazing, the textures and flavours. Maitake paired with black trumpet which is made into a paste. The grapefruits added an extra zing! Yummy!
This was so delicious! Really enjoyed it. Chef @ivanbrehm, thanks for the lovely treat.
Here at @restaurantnouri, one feels immediately at home the moment you are seated. Every dish is meant to nourish your body and soul. Chef @ivanbrehm\'s new risotto dish certainly did that for us. Dandelion risotto, coffee fluid gel, black olive oil, walnut praline, and a small piece of candied orange in the middle. Finally, dusted with dandelion powder and black orange powder, this was AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. Can\'t wait for it to be on the menu! Chef, thanks for the letting us try this new course.
It\'s chicken karaage with dandelion puree, dandelion powder and crowned small dollops of spicy mayo. You should have seen our faces when Chef @ivanbrehm surprised us with this. This is not like any other chicken karaage we\'ve eaten before, both in its appearance and taste. Needless to say, as we dug in to savour this, there was complete silence, conversations stopped and you can only hear soft murmurs  of hmmmm... this is so good. The best part is that the two friends I was dining with are non foodies and I think after a meal here, they are now fans of Chef @ivanbrehm. I can\'t wait for this to be on the menu soon!
Helmed by chef-owner Ivan Brehm, previously from The Kitchen at Bacchanalia, this intimate new restaurant at Amoy Street serves up an impressive omakase set menu both for lunch and dinner — file this away for business meals to impress, or special occasion dates. Nouri serves what the restaurant terms \"crossroads cooking\", where chef Brehm draws influences from cuisines across the world. The best way to understand his cooking philosophy is to splash out on the 5- or 7-Course Chef\'s Tasting Menu ($140/$170) for dinner, and ask to sit at the chef\'s table to watch the team work their magic. What commences is a well-orchestrated experience of unique flavours and textures coming together in stunning dishes, many of which have the Burpple community raving. These include the Acaraje and Vatapa, which sees falafel-like fritters served in a flavourful turmeric and coconut sauce, as well as the Steak and A1 Keluak Mole, which features a grass-fed wagyu rump cap slicked in buah keluak and bone marrow sauce. Pro tip: For a more affordable initiation, visit at lunch for the 5-Course Omakase Lunch Menu ($85, not available on Mondays). A curated selection of mains are available a la carte (from $28).\n<br />Avg Price: $150 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Blueskies Cottonclouds
I am not a fan of fish (yes, yes,  I know it\'s healthier for me) but at @restaurantnouri, I am a convert! The garoupa here is super fresh and delicious! In fact, if you order the fish course for lunch, you get rewarded with the most amazing purple purée made from sweet potatoes and coconut. Chef, thanks for sending this our way. We really enjoyed it.
The buak keluak A1 bone marrow sauce, which was a first for me, went really well with the grassfed Wagyu rump cap. I had some hesitation ordering this at first as buah keluak can have a really strong and overpowering taste but here, it didn\'t outshine the protagonist but played its part really well. Yummy! The mustard laced mountain yam and potato purée which accompanied my steak was simply divine!
For me, it\'s always soups, perhaps it\'s what I grew up on. You can\'t imagine how delighted I was when Chef @ivanbrehm surprised us with this course last week during lunch. Thanks, Chef! Maitake mushroom sitting gloriously on a bed of black trumpet and black truffle purée, and finally, accompanied by mushroom broth with a tinge of Szechuan oil. This was so good that it did not only nourish my body but also my spirit. I absolutely loved every mouthful of this course and wished it would never end. Of course when I couldn\'t scoop up the last drops of the broth, the freshly made sourdough bread helped me soak it all up.

Nouri does it so well that I actually love it. Raymond\'s grouper is just executed so well here and I love the Thai elements at play, the green mango, Ebi sakura. All the small details that really brings out the best in the fish. I would order this again for sure!
Using their signature to die for vegetable broth as the base, at lunch, your broth is further enhanced to pair your mains. I had the fish restaurant broth.
Well, I have a little confession. I spotted this at my first lunch at Nouri as a good friend had ordered fish and I knew I had to try this the next time I am back. I am glad I did. I loved this side of coconut and sweet potato mash. Can\'t describe it, so velvety and rich, I found it deeply comforting and it reminded me of familiar flavours and yet different. Something that Chef Ivan is very good at evoking.
I found them crunchy and delicious. I like the fact that my teishoku lunch incorporated a lot of vegetables which many restaurants tend to forget, the essence of a healthy and balanced diet.
You can choose your mains and depending on your choice, you are served several side dishes, all carefully curated to complement your mains. I loved my green mango salad which was light and just sour enough to tease my tastebuds.
No matter how many times I\'ve had it, I keep craving for more. Thanks, Chef, for sending this over. Our bowls were spotless! We mopped up every drop of your delectable curry.
One word: Glorious.\n<br />It was a performance that\'ll be talked about in awe long after, as everything just came together so perfectly.\n<br />Accompanying the solo Afro-Brazilian fritter on stage this time were the most perfect specimens of vegetables and mushroom (auditions must have been a bitch).\n<br />The undisputed show-stealer was, for me, the coconut curry still. It\'s simply electrifying with an extraordinary amount of flavour, complexity and richness packed within those few millilitres.
When a meal begins on a simple but exquisite note of housemade sourdough and parsley butter, you know the rest of it is going to be more than alright. \n<br />The interesting thing is the flavour of their butter changes as it depends on what Chef Ivan Brehm gets his hands on, and how the produce inspires him.
Our amazing evening at @restaurantnouri ended on a really high and fun note as we were made to work for our petit fours. After finally figuring it out, the reward came in a nicely wrapped parcel. Aged nutmeg candies, perfect ending to a lovely, lovely evening.
Isn\'t it gorgeous? Somehow it reminded me of the Japanese anime, Totoro. Perhaps it\'s the Nasturtium leaf which is hiding a delectable marshmallow. Pick them all up and you are meant to eat them all together. Again, superb play on flavours and textures!
The dessert course may look simple but don\'t let looks deceive you. Different textures of plum, Mirabelle plum fluid gel and chocolate moelleux, once you start, you want to each mouthful to linger. When I had it the second time I was back, my friend commented he was torn. He couldn\'t decide which was the last taste he wanted lingering in his palate. The plums or the chocolate? I decided for me, have them both! I found it really nice that they paired this with a nice cup of Oolong tea.
This is by far the most impressive pre dessert I\'ve had. It just sets the bar so high. The good news is that you can have this at lunch as they are, I believe, currently serving it for dessert during lunch!
For the fourth course, you have a choice and we both unanimously chose the beef. This grass fed tenderloin was amazing. If you can see how pink it is, you can imagine how soft it is on the inside and nicely charred on the outside. Paired with cultured red onion, Guinness stout pickled onions, onion ketchup and charred spring onion purée, I was torn as to which allium tasted the best. Finally, I decided that it\'s teamwork, each of them played their part to complement the beef and they did so beautifully.
@restaurantnouri\'s interpretation of this Calabrian classic was really good. Wagyu eye round and kimchi sandwiched between two pieces of lavosh, served with a charred pepper emulsion. This course needs no utensils. Just pick them up and munch away. So good!
I\'ve actually had Acaraje before at Rio de Janeiro a few years ago and hence, I thought this course sounded vaguely familiar. Of course, nothing prepared me for what Chef @ivanbrehm served. This course blew me away. Conversations halted and we just dug in, savouring every mouthful, wishing for more of the delightful Vatapa and hoping the last mouthful never comes. When it did, we didn\'t give up and since licking our plates would be totally unacceptable, the team was kind enough to offer us more bread to wipe our plates clean. The Acaraje is an Afro-Brazilian fritter, and the Vatapa which really shone for me is a turmeric and coconut curry, and the inner circle, bread and prawn sauce. Oh, this is the dish that keeps me coming back for more.
This smells as heavenly as it looks. Hatiku farm berries, burrata pugliese, oat broth and petai leaf, this course encapsulates what Nouri is all about. Nourishing your body and yet evoking tastes and smells which are faintly familiar to your culture and yet different. So comforting, so good.
Pop it into your mouth, close your eyes and enjoy the sublime flavours. The gherkin with tarhana and kombu was sharp enough to whet our appetite for our first main course.
My favourite was the blinidli with cultured coconut and caviar. What a clever play of flavours and cultures. I\'ve had this twice and I don\'t think I will ever get tired of it. That\'s how good it is.
The vegetable broth consists of 7 vegetables which is meant to revive and nourish the body. So light and full of flavour, it\'s the best broth or soup I have had. Served with rye sour dough and silken cheese, it was so good that we were left wanting for more  @veronicaphua thanks for inviting me to join you as this turned out to be my most amazing meal this year. Chef @ivanbrehm is a genius!
Our very memorable dinner at @restaurantnouri ended on an intriguing note with the petit fours presented in a gorgeous Japanese wooden puzzle box. Working out how to open it kept us entertained for a few minutes. After Burppler @blueskiescottonclouds and I solved it by making the correct sequence of four sliding moves, we were rewarded to find two tiny twine-wrapped bundles within. These contained candy made from nutmeg that\'d been aged for seven days. The nutmeg itself has quite a history too. We were told they came from trees in Penang that go all the way back to the time when the Dutch colonised this part of the world. The candy itself tasted as unique and delicious as the meal that preceded it.
This was the second last item to be served to us. I had half expected a tiny Kermit to peek out from under that leaf but nope, it was an exquisite marshmallow taking cover instead.\n<br />We were instructed to use the leaf to wrap the oblong block of marshmallow before popping the whole thing in our mouth. The combination of the peppery leaf and the gentle sweetness of the cushiony-soft marshmallow was a revelation. Loved it!
Like fireworks in the night sky, the coconut curry lit up my tastebuds with a burst of flavours that floored me momentarily into silence.\n<br />The Afro-Brazilian fritters, which reminded me a little of falafel, were just wow with the spectacular curry. Served on the side was a slice of bread which was very useful in mopping up every drop on the plate. \n<br />Every course in the Chef\'s Tasting Menu was memorable but this, this was outstanding.\n<br />(5-course: $140++, 7-course: $170++)
That\'s not beef. It\'s butter.\n<br />Ok, I\'m kidding. It IS beef but only the most velvety smooth of texture that I\'ve had in years. Am pretty sure the cow which had been fed on grass for 3 years and grain for 2 years (I hope I remembered the numbers correctly!) had something to do with it.\n<br />@ivanbrehm the Head Chef-owner of this brand new restaurant, Nouri, deserves the rest of the credit in developing this unreal piece of tenderloin to such exquisiteness. \n<br />Simply named \"Beef and Alliums\", this is a main course option in the Chef\'s Dinner Tasting Menu. Besides the tenderloin, it showcases a variety of produce from the onion family that have undergone unusual preparation methods before arriving on the plate. The menu lists them as: cultured onion, Guinness Stout-pickled onion, onion ketchup and charred spring onion purée.

18 veggies tucked into edible soil redolent with sesame... maybe my favorite dish of the evening!  #burpple
This is yellowtail, Iberico pork jowl and Toyo barbeque sauce... #burpple
A trio of steamed maitake mushroom, black trumpet and black truffle purée make unlikely bedfellows with Mandarin orange segments and Brazilian chilli oil mushroom broth (poured from a quaint clay Chinese teapot no less), but the unlikely combination both surprised and pleased our palates. The comforting earthiness of the mushrooms is delightfully interspersed with moments of tingly heat courtesy of Sancho pepper, Szechuan peppercorn and the Szechuan oil-laced broth. A welcome respite from the richer courses preceding it and a most memorable dish that stands on its own as well.
When asked what his favourite cocktail was, @fongjoe1219 replied \'negroni\'. Naturally, we (meaning @sk_food_and_travel) had to try the negroni. It was really good - aromatic and smoky. We were told that the secret was Fernet-Branca, an Italian herbal liqueur, and smoked cinnamon. An interesting twist to an old classic.\n<br />*\n<br />After dinner, @fongjoe1219 introduced @sk_food_and_travel to what he called \'Three Way\', a cocktail of bourbon,scotch and rum. Now that was a perfect way to end dinner 😋.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #hgfoodie_alcohol #nourisg #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
A popular Brazilian dessert made of egg yolk, sugar and ground coconut. Brazil, a former Portuguese colony, has strong Portuguese influence in its cuisine.  Malacca, in Malaysia, was also colonised by the Portuguese and for this same reason, this dessert tasted so familiar! It reminded me of Portuguese egg tart but the addition of coconut made it also taste like kaya (coconut jam)!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #nourisg #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Requeijao, a traditional Portuguese cream cheese, was slightly savoury and when mixed with the slightly tart lemon curd, was a dessert made in heaven!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #nourisg #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I remember eating devil\'s curry (and sugee cake 😍) whenever we visited my aunt\'s Eurasian family during Christmas. This dish brought back fond memories, of good food of course.\n<br />*\n<br />The curry was lightly spiced but with enough curry flavour (though I personally would have preferred it more spicy 😂). Served with achar pickles and a crunchy rice cracker.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #reataurantnouri #nourisg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Strange as it may seem, the combination worked really well.\n<br />*\n<br />As soon as I bit into the peppercorn, the taste transformed. There was a hint of pepper crab flavour. Was I imagining it?\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Sardine which was lightly cured and then pickled. I love sardines, especially when cured well, which in this case it was.\n<br />*\n<br />The light pickle flavour was very refreshing. Reminded me of Peranakan achar. Absolutely delicious.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The spice paste had a very unique curry-like taste.

A trio of 1) clams bulhao pato in a cracker, 2) kombu (kelp) &amp; king crab on a cracker and 3) pineapple tart &amp; foie gras parfait.\n<br />*\n<br />What was in that clam cracker?

Both chefs were good friends and worked really well together. I felt they brought out the best in each other.

Arrived early as I was so excited that I got the timing wrong? @veronicaphua introduced us to @timtimtokyo and his friend @kenneth_sk_wong. Great to meet both of you and to finally put a face to @timtimtokyo.\n<br />*\n<br />I was still deciding on what to order when I saw @elevened make this drink for a guest. I immediately asked for one as well 😂. A cocktail of Mezcal, St Germain and Chartreuse. Fruity and floral but just a tad too sweet for me.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
The prawn head jus reminded us vaguely of Hae Koh sans the belacan, again, hints of the familiar and yet unknown.
This was a refreshing course and potato noodles really complemented the salted cod well.
The chicken or should I say poussin was my choice and it was yummylicious! The hasselback potatoes were insanely good too.

Turmeric and coconut curry with falafel (vegetarian fritter), oyster mushroom, Japanese potato, mountain yam and nastartium leaf.\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you Chef @ivanbrehm and Restaurant Manager Matthew @elevened for sending this our way. We loved it so much we had extra sourdough to mop up the gravy.

It is served as a Japanese Teishoku style set meal. Upon Restaurant Manager Matthew\'s (@elevened) recommendation, I chose the chicken set for $36. *\n<br />It came with homemade sourdough and parsley butter as well as the super concentrated broth normally served at dinner but enriched with chicken.\n<br />*\n<br />The main dish was a poussin (spring) chicken in bois boudran sauce. This was sooo delicious! Very tender and full of flavour. Served with hasselback potatoes (Swedish roast potatoes) which was equally as yummy.\n<br />*\n<br />Dessert was banana and rum foam with Tahitian vanilla ice cream and buckwheat crumble, similar to dinner.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Chef @ivanbrehm and team really embraced the concept of farm to table serving fresh seasonal ingredients from local farmers.\n<br />*\n<br />In line with the phrase \'what you nourish nourishes you\', the wine served was organic. Recommended by Restaurant Manager, Matthew #elevened, we had an orange wine - 2012 Clai Sveti Jakov Malvazija from Istria, Croatia. I\'ve never had wine from Croatia so I was quite intrigued. The wine was indeed orange in colour, full bodied with a medium finish.\n<br />*\n<br />For those who are wondering about the toad, it was a really fun way of presenting the bill!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Banana and rum foam with Tahitian vanilla ice cream. Buckwheat crumble and calamansi zest to contrast and reduce the sweetness of the foam and ice cream. I usually do not like sweet desserts but the combination worked well and the buckwheat crumble gave it lots of crunch.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Chicken breast cooked with white pepper. Served with dandelion stem, pistachio, dill and anise powder. This was another new dish which  was not on the dinner menu yet. I hope it will be.\n<br />*\n<br />I normally do not like chicken breast but this was really very good. The meat was already tender and flavourful on its own. The pistachios gave it crunch while the pomegranate seeds gave it a refreshing tanginess.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was not part of the menu but Chef @ivanbrehm was creating new dishes which he wanted some feedback on. We were of course happy to try more of his culinary creativity 😍.\n<br />*\n<br />The foam had a strong garlic flavour from the Chinese forest chives. I love garlic and loved how it blended so well with the crab.\n<br />*\n<br />This dish was a winner for me. I am cognizant that garlic may not appeal to all but I loved this!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This for me was the highlight of the night. It was sooo delicious that we asked for an extra helping of bread to mop up the gravy.\n<br />*\n<br />As Chef @ivanbrehm is Brazilian, we can understand why this dish would be close to his heart. Brazilian fritter (acaraje) on shrimp stew (vatapa) in the centre, served with turmeric and coconut curry on the outside.\n<br />*\n<br />We were completely blown away by the intensity of flavours. This dish alone would make you yearn to come back 😋.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
With gooseberries fresh from Hatiku organic farm in Cameron Highlands. Served with warm burrata pugliese, oat broth and petai leaf. Yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />I love the emphasis on fresh vegetables direct from the farm.

My blinidli with cultured coconut was served with okra seeds rather than caviar. I am unfortunately allergic to fish roe. Thankfully, I can eat uni because the black rice cracker with miso-uni emulsion was super delicious. So sweet and creamy.\n<br />*\n<br />What is a blinidli you may ask? It is actually a combination of a Russian blini and an Indian idli. The cultured coconut complemented the blinidli really well.\n<br />*\n<br />The last snack was gherkin with cultured cream and Sarawak peppercorn. This must have been really good because I enjoyed it despite not liking gherkins!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #restaurantnouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
In my case, it was chicken stock.\n<br />*\n<br />This is the best chicken broth I\'ve had!

When @veronicaphua and @blueskiescottonclouds said I had to try the soft opening dinner menu, I did not hesitate.\n<br />*\n<br />Helmed by Chef @ivanbrehm the cuisine is a reflection of the different cultures and countries he has encountered. This really made the menu very unique and quintessentially multi cultural.\n<br />*\n<br />The first dish was bread and broth. Rye sourdough served with silken cheese and vegetable broth. The silken cheese was silky smooth and tasted like panna cotta.\n<br />*\n<br />The highlight, however, was definitely the broth. It was amazing! I\'ve never had broth so pure and delicious. I love Chef Ivan\'s farm to table concept and how he uses these vegetables in such an innovative manner. It was truly evident in this broth which was steam extracted from 7 different varieties of vegetables from contracted farms in nearby Cameron Highlands. Listening to him speak passionately about the vegetables made me appreciate his culinary creativity even more.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_nouri #nouri #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
