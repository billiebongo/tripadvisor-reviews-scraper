Was v excited to see this interesting concoction! A treat for speculos lovers, brownies were chewy too :) only thing was that it was a bit dry, not moist enough  or sufficient sauce of any kind to make it more goowy. 
A tad sour for me cos I\'m a sweet tooth hehe, but in general a nice and refreshing treat! :) 
Didn\'t manage to have the chance to enjoy the ambience of the store, but it sure looks good! The cake taste good, but definitely not to have a big big slice at one go, for me personally! Enjoyable~ 
Fresh strawberries and fluffy cake from BB tucked in a quiet corner of an old estate - Bendemeer. Cakes are very reasonably priced. My favorite is their red velvet! Excited to try more flavors.
Their Lychee Martini cake - the light and fluffy sponge cake is layered beautifully between fresh whipped cream and lychee bits.¬† 
The alcohol content is light here, present only in the lychees. Not sure if the rose bud had to do with it, but the whip cream had a flowery fragrance to it, didn\'t particularly like that. The cake is light and airy, but I probably won\'t get this again. 
Enjoyed this not-too-sweet dessert. The cheese was light and not overpowering with a nice buttery crust at the bottom. Definitely recommended!
There\'s always a bladder for coffee! üòå Lovely little cafe hidden in the neighborhood in boon keng; stumbled upon this place yipee! There\'s a selection of cakes and baked items too (gotta drop by again hehe ;D)
A really cosy place located just under a HDB block! Yet this humble Avenue offers a great variety of really good cakes and Tarts at prices ranging from 4 to 6 dollars! The Cheesecake was definitely a winner. 
It was delicious! The crumble is so yummy! The crust was nice and crisp. I\'m not a big apple pie fan but I enjoyed this :)
Speculoos apple tart was good, though it felt a tad dry at times. Tart had a buttery fragrance to it, quite like Danish cookie, and didn\'t get too heavy on the palate. Passion fruit cheesecake was average, felt that cheesecake doesn\'t go well with something sour. Although it was quite light, the passion fruit overpowers all taste. 
In the Bendemeer neighbourhood, quaint dessert cafe. IMO, can skip the strawberry shortcake and dive into the raspberry mango mascarpone tart!
Named after the location of Le Cordon Bleu London in Bloomsbury Square, this cafe brings part of England to the Bendemeer neighbourhood. Their specialty cakes offered at Cafe Fest include the Banana Peanut Butter Cake (truly one of the best marriages in food history) and a brand new item - Speculoos Cheesecake. Speculoos. Cheesecake. Need we say more?
Soft, fluffy and not too sweet. Just the way I like it. üòäüëç
Light and fluffy cake! Need to try their strawberry shortcake. üç∞üçì
Jelly-like lemon curd was tart but on the verge of getting sour, with a well whipped meringue that was able to neutralise the sourness with its subtle sweetness. Tart-base keeps its shape well and does not crumble messily. 
Chewy chunks of Martini-doused lychees in a fresh cream layered vanilla cake, which helps to mediate the alcoholic taste.
Best cheesecake i have tasted so far! Creamy, and with the graham biscuits crumbles on the top adds more texture. The base is good too! Really recommend their cheesecake. The shop is in the HDB area and its small and cosy.
Earl grey lovers will love this!
Love this uniquely Singapore cheesecake!
So when I saw this, I was like, MUST TRY!! It\'s the Brownie Speculoos Crumble Tart (Pate sucre, Brownie, Speculoos drizzle &amp; Speculoos crumble) #latergram #sabbyisafoodie #burpple #cafe #cafesg #sgig #igsg #instadaily #instagood #instafood #instadessert #potd #dessertlover #dessert #dessertsg #yummy #shiok #happy #speculoos #delicious #sgeats #sgfoodie #foodie #foodiegram #foodiesg #bloomsburybakers #singapore #sg

Someone took a bite off my Chendol cheesecake while I wasn\'t looking. üò¢
On a side note, the orh-nee and chendol cake is so popular that it\'s sold out for the day. üòî
Fell in love with it immediately! üòç
