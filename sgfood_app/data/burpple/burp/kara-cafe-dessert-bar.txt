Brought to us by the people behind Sogurt, KARA Caf√© &amp; Dessert Bar offers the best of both worlds with their eclectic menu injected with Thai, Japanese and Western influences as well as their all familiar froyo flavours.
Other than desserts and the guilt-inducing snacks, Kara has got an extensive menu including hearty grain bowls and salads.
MELTED CHEESE oozing out. Understand from Li Ping, most of the dishes crafted are based on the cuisine she had during her college days in LA. Slices of pepperoni salami, oozy cheese packed between slices of toasted sourdough, it\'s such a comforting food! Though some might not like garlic and basil used. Top up $3.50 and get a bowl of house made tomato miso soup.
Pork belly miso rice, Truffle tots, Korean Chicken Wings and PB cookie.
Super addictive crispy tater tots! Go for the Okonomiyaki ($12) - generously lathered with kewpie mayo, truffle dressing, unagi sauce (more like umami) and furikake. Didn\'t taste like okonomiyaki but it was definitely delish. 
Kara\'s homemade Mochi waffles are slightly chewy inside, so I found it a tad denser than the kind that I like, but at least the flavours and pairing of toppings were pretty on point. 
Traditional waffles are so yesterday üíÅ KARA\'s homemade waffles ($12.50+) use a mochi-inspired waffle base. Chewy on the inside (just like a mochi) so don\'t expect any crispy fluffy waffles. I personally like it a lot, even though I do enjoy crispy waffles too. I found myself reaching for this many times, even though I was so stuffed at the end of the night.
One of my favourites from @karacafe would be the Korean Wings ($13). Loved how it wasn\'t greasy, remained crisp for a long time, and the sweet-savoury glaze of honey with Japanese soy &amp; garlic was pretty addictive.
Okonomiyaki Truffle Tots ($12.00+) is KARA\'s take on Tater Tots (i.e. bite-sized pieces of hashbrowns). It comes with Kewpie mayo, unagi sauce, truffle dressing &amp; furikaka. Reading about it sounds good. Smelling it was even better. Tasting it was THE bomb.
Kara\'s classic grilled cheese toasties are as comfort food goes - simple, not overwhelming and doesn\'t compromise on taste. Crisp toast with oozy melted signature Kara cheese blend; for someone who dislikes pickles, I certainly didn\'t mind them in this toastie for that savoury-sweet with a tinge of sourness. Comes with salad for a balanced diet. So you can be sure it\'s a healthy dish. üòõ 
Ok so here\'s the deal. Everyone knows I don\'t eat chicken wings because I meticulously peel the skin off of fish &amp; chicken when I eat them. With chicken wings, that\'s just lame &amp; not worth it.
The owner of Sogurt &amp; our wonderful host Li Ping explained to us that this revamp was born out of the need to innovate, to stay competitive &amp; relevant in the F&amp;B industry. KARA serves grain bowls, which are all the rage now, &amp; they are unique in that they are very much fusion inspired dishes. Each bowl comes with your choice of base: Garlic Japanese Rice or Quinoa (additional $3.00+). 
Pork belly miso, top recommended at Kara...basically Japanese rice bowl with braised fatty pork belly and miso sauce. Not unworth it at arn $15 but sounds much better than it tastes.
Latte w sweet cookie! Can\'t figure out the drawing tho...do u guys know? Anw latte was $5.90
inner mochi texture with waffle-like crust sprinkled with brownie bits, almonds, berries and not missing out the refreshing lychee rose froyo üëåüèª
@karacafesg for dinner the other night as we had almost everything in the menu till the tables were positively groaning with food. But no way am I going off without having their Homemade Mochi Waffles ($12.50).
Classic Grilled Cheese Toastie ($10.50+)\n<br />Can\'t go wrong with a good ol\' classic! As Li Ping explained, the menu here is very LA-inspired (from her college days üéì), &amp; this is no exception. This is one of the Grilled Toasties that KARA has to offer. üßÄ üçû Kara\'s signature cheese blend with a zesty pickle relish in between 2 slices of Sourdough bread. 
The Tomato Miso Soup ($6.00+) is fairly ordinary on its own, but goes really well with the grilled cheese toasties.
Made a return visit to KARA Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar last night; a cafe concept by the folks behind Sogurt which sees hot food served alongside desserts with their range of Froyo and ice-creams available for dine-in or takeaway just like how Sogurt serves them.
Those who school or live in the Bukit Timah area must be familiar with Sogurt - now, their flagship store has been rebranded into a new concept, KARA Caf√© &amp; Dessert Bar. Their self-serve froyo counter is still there (phew), but what\'s different is that they now serve main dishes, (more) desserts, drinks, &amp; the likes.
Might sound confusing but as it turns out, the food here is generally good enough for a fun night out in this gorgeous space! Decent variety, there\'s something for everyone. Go for their chicken wings and tater tots; grain bowls for a balanced diet, and desserts for a sweet ending. I absolutely love their froyo (my favourites were the speculoos and the very fragrant lychee rose - and chocolate so luscious you wouldn\'t believe it was just froyo!) Thank you @karacafesg for having us and #burpple for extending the invite! üòä
Well, it\'s actually officially called the Taco Mexx Chicken, but let\'s not let pesky semantics get in the way now. A thoroughly filling bowl of rice is fully loaded with a generous serving of shredded, taco spiced chicken, corn chips, jalape√±os, chipotle salsa, a healthy dollop of cilantro crema, and the star attraction of half (!) an avocado.
Hooking tomato soup up with grilled cheese is nothing new, but Kara turns it into a power couple with their little tweaks on both the soup and the toastie.
Kara is really pushing their new concept of being a versatile caf√© that ain\'t just for desserts real hard, and leading that charge is their pork belly miso ricebowl. 
Sogurt\'s newest venture, Kara Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar, features a lot more than frozen yogurt on its surprisingly expansive menu.
I decided to opt for maple lavender, which had a prominent floral flavour and lingering fragrance that was pleasant, aromatic and refreshing! üíñ Texture was also smooth, creamy and a melt-in-the mouth kind that I adore üòã. The matcha mochi waffles had a slightly crisp exterior coupled with a soft, chewy mochi interior. The matcha flavour was surprisingly distinctive, much to my liking with subtle lingering earthy notes. Coupled with a pleasant crunch factors from the speculoos crumbs and cacao nibs, tangy berries and a matcha sauce (wished there was more of this! üíö), I polished off the entire portion all by myself, with guilt but no regrets üòã.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
The cookies were baked to a soft, chewy and sufficiently moist interior which I adore, with a slightly crisp exterior. A striking resemblance to subway cookies (my favourite cookies till date)! üòã The characteristic nutty flavour and aroma of peanut butter is distinctive, along with a subtle chocolatey notes from the semi-melted chocolate chips. The salted speculoos softserve was smooth, creamy with a melt-in-the mouth texture, with the characteristic caramelised sweetnes, coupled with a subtle pleasant lingering saltiness. Sweetness was just right, neither too mild nor overwhelming. On the downside, one of the cookies was overbaked, resulting in a tough, dry and hard texture, as well as a slightly burnt flavour üò¢ .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple
Okonomyaki with a western twist that turned out to be an enjoyable, addictive treat üíñ The tater tots were deep fried to a crisp golden brown exterior, with a lingering and distinctive truffle flavour and aroma. The presence of unagi sauce (basically teriyaki sauce) added a sweet, tangy note, along with creamy mayonnaise, furikake and chopped spring onions- the end result was one that was flavourful, delectable and enjoyable. Portion is pretty huge hence do grab a fren or 2 along to share the indulgence with u! üòâ\n<br />.\n<br />. .\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
Who loves tater tots? ME! üôã\n<br />-\n<br />Okonomiyaki Truffle Tots ($12). Tater tots with a Japanese twist. Perfumed with truffle oil, the deep-fried cylindrical grated potatoes are drizzled liberally with Kewpie mayonnaise, unagi sauce and sprinkled with furikake.\n<br />-\n<br />#karacafesg #tatertots #comfortfood
Featured Homemade Mochi Waffles ($12.50) has a decent crisp exterior and chewy within, and comes with yogurt swirl. Choose the waffle flavour from matcha berry, red velvet (pictured), banana nutella and charcoal sesame.
I have to say... I wasn\'t terribly impressed with this. Either mochi waffles don\'t really work or this wasn\'t the best one. The flavouring was quite nice but the texture was straight - it somehow managed to be moist and dry at the same time oops. üôä Decorated with berries, matcha sauce and served with a Sogurt froyo of your choice (I went with the recommended original) on the side - of all the components on the plate, I probably enjoyed the broken speculoos cookies best.
Such a good looking bowl, eh? I really liked the addition of the noodle crunchies on top and you get to choose to have either a garlic rice or salad base. I went with the rice. üëçüèº
I loved this but I\'m biased because i\'m a peanut butter fanatic. We could choose the yogurt flavour and although the lychee rose was refreshing, we thought maple lavender would compliment the PB flavour better. 
$15.00\n<br />Opened by sogurt, KARA Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar has an amazing cafe-like layout and atmosphere with a great service crew. 
This cosy shophouse space occupied by Sogurt along Bukit Timah Road has undergone a facelift, sporting #millenialpink walls, plush teal seats and a beautiful pastel-themed wall mural. What was once the place for students to grab frozen yogurt has rebranded to Kara Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar, dishing out grain bowls, toasts and desserts. The space is pretty, there are large communal tables and the food is tasty ‚Äî great for an intimate catch-up with a friend. You won\'t go wrong with the chef\'s recommended Pork Belly Miso ($16) that comes with a choice of Garlic Japanese Rice or Quinoa Salad (additional $3). The generous portion of fork-tender, braised pork belly slices is enough to keep us coming back for more. Otherwise, sink your teeth into toasted sandwiches like the comforting Pepperoni Pizzazz ($11.50) that comes loaded with cheese, pepperoni salami and a marinara herb sauce. For desserts, share the Skillet PB Cookie ($15) ‚Äî a decadent dish featuring Salted Speculoos, one of three of the new ice cream flavours from their dessert bar, stacked atop of a huge peanut butter cookie and served with gula Melaka sauce on the side. \n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hilary See
Ever since I had my first skillet cookie at Fynn\'s, I\'ve been on the lookout for more and I\'m glad to have found this at Kara Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar. It\'s a REALLY big cookie base so best to share with three or more friends. Love how intense the peanut butter taste is in the cookie, and the salted speculoos ice cream is creamy, milky and silky ‚Äî in short, amazing. #Burpproved
I love tater tots. I love okonomiyaki. Bam! What\'s not to like about this appetizer? 
I love me a good pork belly. These pork belly slices are oh-so-tender and juicy ‚Äî love it! There\'s an option to have the grain bowl with Garlic Japanese Rice or Quinoa Salad, and I went for Garlic Japanese Rice (no ragrets). The grain bowl also comes with a refreshing cucumber salad, miso cream (best to mix it in) and an egg. #Burpproved
From Kara Cafe &amp; Dessert Bar, a new concept by Sogurt occupying the space of Sogurt\'s Bukit Timah location. It serves primarily Grain Bowls and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches with desserts as well as Sogurt\'s range of Yogurt at the back of the store. Currently in soft launch stage, some items such as the Grain Bowls are unavailable till a later date.
Settled for this since the grain bowl wasn\'t available yet. This would satisfy the grilled cheese toast and pizza lovers ‚Äî a combination of both dishes that sees pepperoni, marinara herb sauce and garlic &amp; basil in between sourdough. Cheese lovers would definitely love this one ‚Äî stringy, melted cheese reveals itself as one pulls the halves apart, and the cheese continues to be so even till the end. The occasional bite on the pepperoni slices does give it a different contrast of savoury flavour, but otherwise it\'s simply a medley of cheese, cheese and more cheese in between crusty slices of toast ‚Äî and that\'s something that is hard not to like.
Coffee doesn\'t seem to be their forte here; while the Flat White had an earthy flavours profile, the frothing of milk could have been better executed, especially since there was a thick layer of foam sitting on the top that was more like a cappuccino than a Flat White.

It‚Äôs such an interesting twist to the conventional grain bowl - the pork belly, ramen crisps and miso cream üòã And the interior of this cafe is #homegoals üòç\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#burpple #hungrygowhere #whati8today #exploresingapore #foodiesg #8dayseat #sgfoodie #iweeklyfood #foodstagram #foodporn #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #foodphotography #karacafeanddessertbar
This is my 3rd session meeting him with different people. I believe I started commenting on your posts more frequently after that cafe festival in 2014. Thank you for planning this session:D Abandoned my usual Sunday skating group lunch to have this! Ordered the taco mexx chicken with quinoa salad as I have been trying to reduce my carbs intake as part of a diet I have been following. Definitely my kind of ambience for a girly feel cafe. Love the vibes there. And lately my group photographs has me with a goofy face üòù #foodphotography #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodheaven #foodsg #foodie #burpple  #sgfood #foodporn #foodpornsg #sgig #foodstagram #foodgram #foodiegram #sgfoodies #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #fatdieme #iconosquare #missionsgcafe350 #burpplesg
The dish turned out to be rather cold to have, except for the rice which was lukewarm.
12.90 for unagi sauced and truffle tater tots. Cldnt taste any truffle...not really worth it, sounds much better on the menu than it was
Dark chocolate. Can do without the mochi waffle as it is not the crispy type which i so desired. The froyo was refreshing on a scorching day.
Pork Belly Miso Grain Bowl...
