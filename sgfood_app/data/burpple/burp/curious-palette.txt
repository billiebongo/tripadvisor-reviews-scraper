Waffles topped with vanilla bean ice cream, red beans and roasted peanuts. Always love their waffles which is delightfully crisp on the outside but light as air on the inside. While I wish the Gula Melaka was more prominent, the combination is something that can satisfy my sweet tooth cravings.
Buttermilk Waffle with Banana Brulee and Wild Berries Compote and Ice Cream ($13.50++) at Curious Palette: always wanted to try this cafe which was also started by the ones who founded the popular Stranger\'s Reunion cafe
If you were to ever head down to curious palette, the ricotta berry hotcake is a must try!üòä the warmth of the pancake really complimented the scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, the taste was further enhanced with maple syrup and a great combination of nuts and berries üçì\n<br />- thapas\n
The menu said focaccia but the bread neither looked like nor tasted like focaccia. For the record, avocados should just remain on sourdough. I have not had a better combination so far. I am not a fan of poached eggs but \'we cannot change any items in the dish, sir\'. I respect that; so given the two reasons above, I would not order this dish again. Either I am always ordering the wrong things at Curious Palette, or the menu just does not agree with me. Thankfully, White Magic saved the day. #burpple #curiouspalettesg
The crab cake has a crispy exterior though mushy within. Coat it with the runny egg yolk, complete with the soft muffin bun. Truffled sweet potato fries are served by the side. Satisfying, comforting brunch item.
Quite an average dish, with an interesting addition of curried macademia nuts. The bread could be more toasted, and they should leave the butter out or on the side. And I waited 35 minutes for this üòë. Price okay, taste so-so, wait time, nope.
Lovely buttermilk waffle with banana br√ªl√©e, berry compote and vanilla ice cream. Ideal for Sunday tea. Yummy.
Tucked away at the end of a row of shophouses along Prinsep Street, this is one place you can catch up with your girlfriends in a gorgeous, laidback setting. Start with their excellent Syphon Coffee ($6.90) or a bottle of White Magic ($6.90) ‚Äî a chilled blend of espresso, milk and cream. A favourite and convenient cafe option among nearby art school students and those in town (nearest MRT is Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station), the space can fill up quickly on weekends, so visit either before or after the lunch rush to ensure seats. Almost every table ends the meal with the much photographed Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($14.90) that we highly recommend sharing among a group of four or more. The beautiful creation features a thick pancake with perfectly caramelised sides in a skillet pan, a generous handful of berries, pumpkin and sunflower seeds on the side and topped with a scoop of milky vanilla bean ice cream. Add a drizzle of maple sauce for that finishing touch. For a proper meal, try the Crab Cake on English Muffin ($19.50) that comes with a wobbly sous vide egg and the yummiest truffle sweet potato fries! \n<br />Avg Price: $25 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Hilary See
Quite possibly the most ordered and prettiest dish in Curious Palette, which is why I was told it would only arrive at my table in 30 minutes. Most people shared this dish between two or three or even in a big group, but I attempted to finish this all on my own (i know, stupid move but i really really REALLY wanted to try) and for the first half, it went pretty well. I didn\'t need the maple syrup on the side, simply because the pancake was already lightly sweetened and the vanilla bean ice cream was sweet enough for me. 
Yummy place to stop by for desserts! Waffles &amp; ice cream are good! Not too crowded on a Monday evening
Had to wait 30mins for this as its made upon order. The hotcakes are really nice and i regretted having this all to myself because i felt a bit jelat afterwards (wrong move here). I do like the combination of the fruits and nuts and a scoop of ice cream on top of it, but i do wish they would have separated it as it melts all over da hotcakes and could have more of it as it tends to feel dry after a few minutes of eating..and did tried the waffles too! Its good but i find it a tad pricey. I paid around $17 for this (after splitting the gst &amp; service charge with le friend), its worth a try though!
The sweet potato fries were fab as with fries at curious palette but the crab cake was more mashed potatoes than crab and too mushy.
Super generous portion of fries &amp; fab chicken tenders. Our usual order for dinner - to share of course!
üòç (and possibly the best ricotta hotcakes in SG) #throwback #burpple
Ordered the peach and raisin ricotta hot cake ($14.9) and the banana br√ªl√©e and wild berries compote buttermilk waffles (not pictured; $13.5) and both were absolutely delicious. Highly recommend
Look at them huge blueberries! Tried this variation with the gals today, just as good as the peach &amp; raisins. Love that the standard remained consistent even on a busy Saturday afternoon.
The 30mins wait for this was well worth it! A must have if you\'re at the cafe. Pretty presentation and it actually lives up to its looks!
We went to Curious Palette today because Artichoke was closed for Raya holiday. Not too bad I must say! Good value for money, great ambience, somewhat creative menu and decently executed food. Scotch egg (in picture) was okay, not a huge standout for flavour. But their sweet potato fries omg. Crunchy, fluffy, salty and insanely addictive.  SO GOOD!!! I would go back for just their fries. Order it!!! You won\'t regret it.
The \"white magic\" cold brew coffee was shiok after a Long afternoon of apartment shopping and spicy Thai dinner.. Topped off with a light crisp waffle with poached pears, ice cream and walnuts.. #happiness #burpple
We ordered the Vanilla Infused Strawberry Compote waffles ($12.90) and the Nachos con Carne ($12.90) + Ice cafe latte ($5.90). The waffles were TASTY üçì and crispy too‚ùóÔ∏èThe berries and the vanilla ice cream were creamy and moist, like they were perfect for each other üíü. But the nachos seemed store-bought quality. The chips were definitely bought from a store and the fillings were too small compared to the amount of chips we were givenüòî. D O N T   R E C O M M E N D !! The ice latte was pretty decent and a good drink to shareüëåüèº 
Curious Palette is a beautiful cafe within the shophouses opposite sunshine plaza. The Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($14.90) was an absolute delight to have. The hotcake was soft and fluffy, topped with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, blueberries and a sprinkle of what seems to be lavender. Took about 30mins as it was freshly baked and I can definitely say it was worth the long wait. Great ambience to chill and have a long catch up with your friends.
the berry ricotta hot cakes ($14.90) were so fluffy and moist!!! they recently made their portions smaller tho so around 2-3 people can comfortably finish this now. we also ordered the house-smoked salmon on sourdough ($17.90) and truffle fries ($12.90) to share! the truffle fries came as a generous serving topped with shaved parmesan and truffle bits and were the best i\'ve tried! 
good!!!! but ice cream was too little. added an additional scoop of ice cream cos it\'s kinda jelat to finish the entire thing without ice cream :/
They say good things come in small packages, and in this case, the most sinful, most heart-attack-inducing bowl of fries goes to Curious Palette\'s Spam Fries ($11.90). The seemingly harmless thick-cut chunks of savoury luncheon meat may just amount to a \"couple of sticks\", but we swear we could feel our heartbeat starting to slow just halfway through the bowl. There\'s kaffir lime mayo for dipping, but the spam fries are pretty spectacular on their own. Wash it all down with a cup of good ol\' Flat White ($4.90). \n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Nobelle Liew
($15.90) hahaha ever since I had the ricotta hotcake at Barry\'s in melbs (where else...) I\'ve very proudly joined the ricotta hotcake bandwagon like it\'s even better than waffles!!!! And I LOVE waffles!!! So basically I was curious to try this place out (pun intended ha!!!) cus they offer ricotta hotcakes!!! Anyway since we were getting hotcakes we decided to get the \'savourier\' one out of the 3 on the menu (the other 2 were berry and peach) in the form of candied bacon! Tbh the hotcake itself was pretty dense, could be fluffier (which is what I love about ricotta hotcakes). There were caramelised onions too and I think that\'s the weird part. Like vanilla ice cream, candied bacon + caramelised onions just don\'t match very well hahah after a few bites it started to taste weird. I would like to try the peach one if I\'m back there sometime.
It was alright, tad oily at the top, not too sour or anything. Did expect it to be creamier (something like the one at Hardware Societe in melbs). Can\'t compare to the world\'s best brunch country right?? Hahaha. Although I think it would be better if the bread came in sticks so it\'s easier to handle rather than a large piece of bread. 
The hotcakes from Curious Palette are always amazing - the fluffy ricotta hotcake is prepared only when it\'s to be served so it\'s steaming fresh when you cut into it. I really like the addition of ricotta as it makes it so fragrant and really adds to its flavour and aroma (so it doesn\'t just taste like all the other pancake/waffle/hotcakes out there). You gotta wait quite a bit for them to prepare it (20-30min), but I would say it\'s worth it. If only they gave a bit more ice cream/peach to help cut through the hotcake or add a bit more wetness cause it can get a little gelat after a while (because the ricotta makes it so rich) - but still good nonetheless! Excellent for sharing for 3-4 pax because the portion is so huge. 
A sandwich packed with freshly-shaved prosciutto, cheddar bechamel sauce, topped with runny sunny side up eggs and served with greens and truffle sweet potato fries on the side. The sandwich was ok, nothing to rave about, but the eggs were cooked to the perfect consistency - runny and half-boiled in the centre. The greens complimented the sandwich really well, which could be a bit heavy on its own. The truffle sweet potato fries were good - crispy on the outside, but very light and fluffy on the inside. Not too dense or heavy, with a rather strong truffle aroma throughout. 
All I can say is \'COME INTO MY BELLY\' because this was so fluffy and it crumbles so beautifully, I was literally over the moon eating this! One of the best Hotcake textures out of all the Hotcakes I\'ve tried so far. I love the vanilla bean ice cream, but I felt like this hotcake lacked dimension in terms of flavour! They could have amped it up with more interesting toppings etc, but since the price is relatively cheaper than other places, and the main focus (which is the Hotcake itself) is on-point I have no complaints üëçüèª
I had to get magic mushrooms the name just cracked me up too much!! On the bright side they were flavourful, juicy and super crispy on the outside with their really yummy sauce hidden at the bottom of the plate. There was heaps of sauce - they are that generous! The shave prosciutto dish wasn\'t very stellar tho - quite ordinary. 
I love chai tea!! Wanted to order their matcha at first, but they told me they ran out off matcha powder since there was a problem with restocking. This was pretty good - strong blend of chai flavours which settled well in my stomach without feeling too heavy.
Good and generous portion. Patty was juicy. Sweet potato fries was da bomb 
Very big portion. Can be shared among 3-4 people. Else will be too gelat
Best of hotcake topped with peach, raisins and pumpkin seeds with vanilla icecream. A worthy hotcake is meant to be shared
3/5
Coming here a bit early to enjoy a quiet breakfast makes up the most relaxing part of a family\'s Sunday morning. The portion is so big that I like to share with my Mr. so as the dessert. Really appreciate how they keep the food quality stable! 
üëçüèº Good for sharing but it\'s still a feat trying to finish everything up üòÖ Still as nice after my third time here!
Hotcakes had a slightly crispy exterior which contrasted well with its fluffy interior. The ice-cream added some moisture to the hotcake, which was a bit dry for my liking. The pumpkin seeds add a bit of earthiness to the flavours. The pumpkin seeds would have tasted weird with the hotcake if not for the lavender ice cream which blended the flavours and aromas quite well. The dish could do without the herbs which failed to add a pleasant punch to the dish and was quite discordant with the other aromas and flavours of the dish. 
That there\'s a whole city alive behind the nondescript shopfront nestled on the quiet street. Naturally lit and peaceably bustling. My type of surprise. I had a very nicely prepared hand brew of the Strangers Reunion blend and the country\'s most instagrammed Berry Ricotta hotcake (very much comparable and cheaper to the version at Paddy Hills)
Love my smooth medium bodied cup, that is really easy to drink.
Panko-crusted shell holding generous fillings of corned beef and a surprise center of a molten lava egg. Accompanied with tomato relish and guacamole, made the scotch egg extra flavourful when you mix it in to eat. The portion was just right for one person (you may beg to differ since its Raine we are talking here üòÇ). Best paired with one of their flat white, coffee is always good here üòå One of the \'you should order\' listed in @burpple newest update! Always check the app in deciding what to order!
This colossal dish from the boys at Curious Palatte is as beefy as it gets: The meat, cooked tender to the fork, is full of flavour and generously pilled onto crisp arugula leaves and a slice of toasted sourdough. A coating of coffee powder is dusted over the beef as well, lending a hint of roasted beans to the savoury beef. A helping of caramalised onions and sun-dried tomatoes add contrast to flavours, and the same could be said about the uh-MAY-zing espresso butter drizzled over the poached egg. For $19.50, the dish is good for sharing between two. 
The truffle oil on top of the aioli really turned things around for the better. Crispy fries too!
Opened by the folks behind Strangers\' Reunion, this gorgeous, light-filled cafe in Prinsep Street is a favourite among nearby art school students and office workers alike. Many come for the much photographed Ricotta Hotcake ($14.90). In comparison to Paddy Hills\' prettier version, this is a little more rustic, more affordable and a whole lot more generous ‚Äî you can comfortably share it among four. We like the caramelised sides and the contrasting textures of pumpkin and sunflower seeds and milky vanilla ice cream, but we must admit we started slowing down when we got to the cakey middle. For a lighter sweet treat, the Buttermilk Waffle ($12.50) with Greek Yoghurt, maple syrup and fresh fruit is amazing. If you\'re here for a proper meal, try the Corned Beef Scotch Egg ($17.50), which is beautifully crisp golden on its breaded outside. The meat within is punchy and flavourful, and even better when smeared with the accompanying tomato conserve. For drinks, try the Flat White ($4.90), which is moderately robust and smooth. We also like their excellent Syphon Coffee ($6.90) ‚Äî one of the owners is actually the World Siphonist Championship 2015 winner! Pro-tip: It starts to fill up quickly from noon, so visit either before or after the lunch rush to avoid the crowds.
$3+ per wings for something I can get from anywhere. U judge if it\'s worth it. -M
Just carbonara, with my fav mushrooms, one pathetic foie gras and a not-so-tasty sausage. -M
Berry ricotta hotcake is indeed berry good. Like MacDonald hotcake but thicker and more like a cake ($14.90++). -M

What makes a good dish?\n<br />Definitely one that\'s aesthetic + delicious \n<br />This berry ricotta hotcake was really unique and something I had never tasted before. The hotcake was soft, fluffy and thick and topped with a variety of seeds, berries and a glob of vanilla ice cream. This hot &amp; cold mix is something I LOVE and definitely must try \n<br />HOWEVER, note that you should not attempt to eat one by yourself (we couldn\'t finish + got sick of it) it\'s definitely best shared!
Creamy center w/ the icy cream on top and a sprinkle of sparkling purple magical crystal sugar. I wish there was bigger dollop of ice cream tho, cause I was ended scooping up the hotcakes alone and it just feels too plain yet dense to me with the rich creamcheese aftertaste.
Photo Credit: @jessseet &amp; @jazzyseet \n<br />Late party here finally tried the hotcake plastered everywhere on Instagram and whatever social media outlet you can think of! \n<br />After a 30 minutes wait, a work of art was presented on the table. The thick dense hotcake won my heart over with one bite. The crust like cornering and perfectly cooked hotcake deserves all the good praises it gets. A good pancake/hotcake is one that taste good on its own and this definitely superseded that benchmark. \n<br />Not a fan of the seeds toppings but that\'s just me, would I come back for more hotcake goodness? Without a doubt. 
Buttermilk waffle with gula Melaka, coconut cream topped with red bean, roasted peanuts and vanilla ice cream. Goodness üòç
Ïò§ÎûúÎßå Ïù¥ÎÑ§~ The beautiful Hotcake consisting of fresh berries and vanilla bean ice cream, that makes one come back for more. Glad to see they had made a couple of improvements since my last visit. Smaller portion and less doughy, it was definitely better than before. Saw that they now have Peach &amp; Raisin and Bacon Ricotta Hotcakes, maybe something to try next?
It was too thick for my liking and somehow dry in the middle, nonetheless still a good eat.
You can never go wrong with this. Even my mother-in-law loved it! At just $12.90, this is a great, light ending to a meal. If you\'re just dropping by for coffee and dessert, get this if you\'re alone / in a pair, you may not be able to finish the hotcake on your own! Oh and pls get the Syphon coffee, so so good.
back here again at Curious Palette! today for brunch i had the Pan Seared Salmon ($18.90). a little pricey but it was worth it. i really liked the dressing of the salmon, and when topped off with a squeeze of lemon juice, it tasted perfect. salmon was very well cooked, fish was moist and had a crisp skin. the guacamole paired the salmon superbly, i wish more places would put these two together! i was very happy with my lunch. Curious Palette never fails to satisfy me! üòç
The waffle would have been nicer if it was more fluffy, and accompanied with some sauce. ($13.90)
üê£ Beef could\'ve been a tad more flavorful but the egg is runny oozesome &amp; the breaded crust is tops üëçüçÉ #midweek #lunch
Delicious! Will definitely be returning, strawberry compote waffles with truffle fries 
The waffle was so disappointing. Didn\'t have any distinctive texture, peanuts were rancid. If I only ate that dish, I wouldn\'t return. Thanks god for the ricotta pancake which saved the day.

Visited Curious Palette with the colleagues today and chilled over some cakes, waffles and this delicious fluffy Berry Ricotta Hotcake. Can\'t go wrong if you order this‚Ä¶ well hasn\'t gone wrong the last 2 times I\'ve had this. üòã\n<br />#BerryRicottaHotcake #CuriousPalette
So yummy and worth to try! Better share it with your friends since its a bit too sweet and big for one-person meal. 
Looking at this will take those blues away - such a pretty dish! \n<br />So fluffy &amp; yummy\n<br />Best eaten immediately while is warm.
(Feb 2016) Ah yes, one of the items Curious Palette is famed for - their Berry Ricotta Hotcakes. I remember this thick, fresh, hot, fluffy hotcake having a subacid taste to it. The berries and the pumpkin seeds are welcome, though I do recall preferring a bigger scoop of their vanilla bean ice-cream. üôÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
3.5 munchies: My picks are the berry ricotta hotcake, truffle fries with truffle mayo dip, and iced cafe latte ‚Äì great for a group of 4-5 for afternoon tea or second round after dinner!
Now it\'s one of my favourite cafe! #cheryleatsalot #burpple #curiouspalettesg
How could you not try their popular Berry Ricota Hotcake?? 
I love waffles from Stranger\'s Reunion, and the waffles here did not disappoint. Soft fluffy golden waffles with vanilla beans ice cream, drizzled with vanilla infused strawberry compote and granola. Yums.
Pulled pork was very flavourful but the sourdough bread was a little soggy, drenched under it. Poached eggs was done perfectly, runny and oozing as you dig into it. Overall, a decent dish.
A symphony of flavours that are both treat to the eyes and mouth! Beautifully plated with fresh fruits, seeds and a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Comes with a maple syrup to drizzle with to enhance the taste of the hotcakes! Certainly have the fluffy inside and crisp outside texture! This is absolutely worth the wait of 20 minutes! Be warned tho the portion is huge, I recommend to share the food!
Berry ricotta hotcakes did not disappoint - except that there could have been more ice cream ;) serving portion is quite big and can be shared! Pancake is thick and fluffy, and what\'s unique about this is how sweet the pancakes itself are!!
I really liked their hot cakes! Crispy on the outside and a fluffy and sweet cake on the inside. Paired with the ice cream and strawberries, it was so pretty!!! üôå model : @jess_gabrielle \n<br />#nosnapseed #nofilter
Hotcakes were nice in the beginning but you get \"sian\" after like 5 bites. Spam fries were fat and oily, but I kinda like it.
Visually appealing but doesn\'t really taste as good as it looks. 
Cocoa rich and velvety, made creamy and luscious by a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. We ain\'t complaining, that\'s for sure!
A nice cafe best for brunch. I find the pull pork sourdough pretty good 7/10. But I find their pancakes kind of too thick... Latte is light with a hint of nutty taste. 
I realised that most of Curious Palette mains are in very small portions, and to feel the slightest bit full, you have to order more dishes.\n<br />Tastewise, it was within expectations, because of the variety of pasta dishes I have tasted so far. Depending on your personal preference, I feel that more slices of garlic would have given the dish a bit of an edge over the light taste and little ingredients.\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 3/5\n<br />Worth your calories? Do order this if you have a small appetite. If not stick to the waffles and hotcakes.\n<br />üì∑ Credits: @hipstersgonhate
Although it seems a less fanciful in looks than previously, I don\'t mind this slightly scaled down version. The Hotcake was soft, fluffy and just a little crisp around the edges. The middle can get a bit soggy when the sauce seeps in and the doughy taste can be a little overwhelming after some time, so it\'s best to share this sweet dish between 2 or 3 friends. Overall this is a pretty good dish to have at the cafe and I wouldn\'t mind having this again.\n<br />#CuriousPalette #BerryRicottaHotcake
All funds raised will go a long way in helping Chef Sebastian fight cancer.
Ginger chicken with pumpkin risotto. Love the risotto but the chicken was so so 
Beef was obviously tender (48 hours duh), but not marinated enough to Ben\'s liking. \n<br />Also, be warned that you will not be satiated with this petite serving. \n<br />BTW, that crispy thing on top is like a tempura bacon. Uncommon, but I find it out of place. \n<br />Overall, you should get a better beef experience elsewhere. \n<br />#burpple #beef #dinner #steak #curiouspalette
Nothing like a warm waffle served with a scoop of ice cream &amp; berry sauce to sit pretty in the centre of the weekend brunch table, but not for long. It gets finished off, real quick.

This. Is the reason why I\'d make a trip back. Creamy smooth flat white, with just my preferred amount of acidity. I would have ordered another cup if it wasn\'t already 11pm when I was done with mine. Curious Palette is located at 64 Prinsep Street, taking over what was previously Play Nation, opposite SOTA. Nearest train station being Dhoby Ghaut MRT.  
Fluffy, was a tad undercooked for me, but with the same buttermilk fragrance as Strangers Reunion. Everybody at the table loved the cinnamon walnut toppings and the (slightly small portion of) wine-poached pear slices. The combination of flavours is a proven success formula, but I guess they\'ve got to work on their execution slightly more. Forgivable cause they are still a relatively new establishment? I\'m not sure about that......Curious Palette is located at 64 Prinsep Street, taking over what was previously Play Nation, opposite SOTA. Nearest train station being Dhoby Ghaut MRT.  
Was it really worth 20mins of a wait though? I was more delighted with the use of fresh seeds with raisins more than anything. The hot cake seems slightly chunkier but more crisp to taste. Pretty good for $14.90 really. #burpple #marshmunch

Generous portions and oozy egg. But pulled pork was slightly dry, wished there was more sauce!!!
The much raved and photographed dessert certainly lived up to its name. The hotcake was served freshly-made, so it has a 20 minute waiting time but it definitely is worth it. The hotcake itself was super moist and fluffy inside, and it is steaming when you cut it open. The slightly crisp exterior coupled with the fluffy makes for an irresistible combination. A generous serving of strawberries, blueberries and sunflower seeds are given, and the tart fruits helped to cut through the slightly heavy dish that can get a bit jelat after a while. The maple syrup and ice cream helps to moisten things, although I wish they had given more ice cream because there was just so much hotcake. Nevertheless this is a must order at this place, and can easily be shared with 3-4 people as it\'s a rather large portion. Priced at $14.90
Can\'t remember the exact name of the dish, but this is essentially an Asian-Japanese fusion pasta dish. The sauce was rather light, and while I have no idea as to the exact ingredients it seemed rather soy-based...? There was also the addition of konbu which is apparently some sort of seaweed. Anyway, this was really good and tasty. A refreshing change from the heavy cream or tomato based sauces. The prawns were big and fresh and the addition of mushrooms gave it a nice crunchy texture. It was so good I actually didn\'t even mind the peas. Priced at $18
Much raved cafe in town. Curious like a cat, ordered a curious Croquet Madame. Sounded intriguing on the menu, but it was a rather let down when I was served with the Curious\'s version of Croque Madame. Prosciutto ham sandwiched between plain bread. How disappointing. I was expecting some cheese at least:( Would prefer brioche liked bread with cheese. The sandwich was topped with poached egg ( a little over cooked, not runny). What a let down! Will give this place another chance to try the famous ricotta pancake. Bad choice 
The well-known berry ricotta hotcake that always appears on Instagram. Tasted like a fluffier, slightly lighter version of a cake, but got a little jelat after a while so please share!
Essentially a gargantuan-sized McDonald\'s Hotcake with five times the thickness, and a fluffiness that\'s more Border Collie and less Dachshund. Diminishing marginal returns sets in rather quickly, though. 3.7/5
Willing is not enough; we must do
It is a sizeable portion of food which is good for sharing and the funky elements create a nice balance of sweet, savory and nutty flavors. \n<br />One thing though, if consistency is something you value, you might want to think twice about visiting. I have been there 3 times and have at least 2 similar orders each time and the quality of the mains and waffles differed quite drastically. I recommended waffles (which were fabulous on my first visit) but were dismal on my second and third; the Curious Breakfast was terrible (oily, soggy, extremely salty) on my first visit but surprisingly quite palatable on my second. \n<br />#curiouspalette #burpple
 This colourful and generous assortment of berries and crunchy seeds with the vanilla bean ice cream atop the crisp-outside (especially at the edges)-fluffy-inside ricotta hotcake hit all the right sweet and sour notes, even though I poured only less than half of the somewhat-smoky-flavoured syrup given. I especially loved the sprinkle of leafs, which I found out from the staff were Shiso or perilla sprouts, with a very intriguing flavour profile that\'s slightly minty, bitter... A bit beyond my capacity to describe fully. The hotcake comes in a huge pan so it might be challenging for one to finish! Haven\'t tried the Paddyhills version so can\'t compare yet, but I enjoyed this very much. #Burpple #BurppleTastemakers
Topped with berries, pumpkin/ sunflower seeds and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It gets a little dry in the middle but nonetheless, still a good eat with the crispy crust. üç¥ #curiouspalette
Berry ricotta hotcakes ($14.90) taste a little like a think fluffy version of Mac hotcakes with fresh fruits and vanilla bean ice cream. Freshly made when ordered. Takes about 20 min waiting time. It\'s the best dish I had there so far. Honestly, it\'s worth every penny! üçØ
Spam has never been something I would go for. But this is something quite delicious to chomp. Spam Fries anyone? 
Oh wait, more like afternoon tea already! [Berry Ricotta Hotcake S$14.90]
In my first visit to Curious Palette I had the crab burger which I thought was on the dry side. I would have preferred it with some form of wetter carb or more sauce. The smoked salmon with eggs on sourdough toast was great. And the flat coffee was almost perfect and not acidic. Lovely place to hang out, with its natural lighting, hanging plants and natural woods. A move away from industrial themed style cafes. 
Been to Curious Palette 3 times in a week, so longer curious for me! Had dinner here and sampled their Beef Cheek in Cous Cous. A dish with the potential to be heavy on the palette ended up quite a light and nourishing meal. 
One of the better waffles that I\'ve had so far. This was taken way back before the food trail started haha. \n<br />Such #memories. \n<br />Anyway, this waffles has red beans and peanuts all over it, drizzled with gula melaka sauce, and promises a pretty unique mix of flavours that you don\'t usually find in dessert waffles outside. Recommended to try this. \n<br />#waffles #dessert #burpple #cafe #icecream
Not gonna pretend i know coffee, but i can tell the coffee here is pretty darn good - smooth microfoam + uncharacteristically flavourful without the unpleasant bite. Thank goodness this is near school.
üçÉüçÇüåæüçì I\'m glad this {Berry Ricotta Hotcake} both looks good and tastes good! Soft, fluffy and moist and one bite into it got me like üòç Love the berries and generous sprinkle of pumpkin seeds! Plus that ice cream that will never go wrong yummm~~ üòã
Salty-sweet and crunchy, the heap of fries were crispy around the edges on the outside and tender on the inside. I was a little skeptical about the dip at first but the earthy flavour and aroma of truffles were too difficult to resist! Altogether a not very healthy but irresistible side that I just couldn\'t stop munching on and dipping into the complementing truffle oil aioli.
Thanks @grouphuntsg for this keysmart organiser! It\'s pretty useful and we can keep our keys in a neater way. The concept is same like a Swiss Army knife actually! Haha!

Okay, a \'cakey\' like texture, lifted in taste with those crispy br√ªl√©e pieces. \n<br />The winner is in its hipster ambience really.
Berry Ricotta Hotcake with fresh berries, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and vanilla bean ice cream. Pour some maple syrup into the moist and fluffy hotcake to get maximum pleasure.¬†
It may be simply fried sticks of spam; yet this unassuming side was my favourite of the meal. Thick thumb-widthed chunks of spam¬†fried to perfection, boasting a crisp exterior and soft melt-in-your-mouth insides. I\'ve not had spam fries quite like these and must say I polished them off in no time.
(cute waffles and monster-sized delicious ricotta hotcake with a couple of idiotsüòåüòå)
Didn\'t care much for the top layer of Toffee/Dulce de Leche, was too sticky and the mouthfeel was great, but damned, this has got to be the best Brownie Cheesecake I\'ve ever tasted. \n<br />Great balance of savoury cheesecake and dense chocolatey brownie, not too sweet, great with my cuppa coffee! 
Colourful and packed with ingredients, this breakfast plate was an astonishing disappointment. I\'ll go as far as to call it the worst I\'ve tried. Artichoke and \'relish\' that tastes straight out of a jar, bitter undressed veggies, and deep-fried - not grilled - slices of bacon. The worst has to be the rosti, so oily and soggy I felt I was eating mee sua out of a dish of oil. It\'s the most unwarranted 25 bucks I\'ve spend.
Joining the hotcakes hype, Curious Palette\'s $18.90 version has a generous serving of fruits and taro flavored thingums. Hotcake was slightly too dense but still had a good crunch around the edges! It got abit gelat after a while so sharing among 3 would be good. The chai latte is one of the best I\'ve had!!!!! 
Admittedly pretty damn good waffle: crisp on the outside, soft and utterly fluffy insides. This Gula Melaka and Coconut Cream Waffle (S$14.90++) came topped with a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, red beans, and some roasted peanuts. I couldn\'t taste much coconut in this, but it made a very decent - though pricey - vanilla ice cream waffle.
It\'s pretty much like the paddy hills one. I\'m not a total fan of hot cakes in general, but with three people... We didn\'t finish this one too. 
Looks sublime, tastes worlds apart. This super photogenic Berry Ricotta Hotcake (S$18.90++) is undoubtedly one of the prettiest pancakes I\'ve seen - yet it\'s flavours come close to the worst I\'ve tried. Cause it was nearly tasteless. Any flavours at all comes from the accompanying seeds and nuts, ice cream, and syrup. The texture it\'d nailed to a dot, but the hotcake was bland beyond words. It\'s like having the fluffiest cloud melting in your mouth - just that it tasted of nothing. No sugar, no butter, no eggy goodness. Even the herb garnish tasted stronger.
Sharing size is for 3-4 pax. It\'s really big!!!!!! 
Feels good to give ma friends a treat :)
I waited so long for this thicky and not fluffy hotcake. I prefer Paddy Hills version, but here\'s toppings are much more than Paddy Hills. I read many reviews and I don\'t know why many people prefer Curious Palette\'s hotcake version, it\'s too thick. Luckily, they served the vanilla ice cream and maple syrup..
A great cuppa brighten up my days but sometimes less is more. Tried insomnia (4 shots, unlike magic, 2 shots) and the acidity is really like a punch in my face. Shall not try to be too adventurous the next time. Sticking to my norm is still the best. However the hotcake here is good. Missing that \"garden\" in my mouth. üòçüòçüòç
I\'m sweet potato junkie! I totally adore this sweet potato fries!! Truffle oil on garlic aioli. Interesting. A decent big bowl of it..
With lotsa strawberries, blueberries, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds.. I\'m intrigued by the lavender infused sugar on the ice cream! Hahaha! Told my friend today, it felt like I ate an air freshener.. Hahaha!! One thing I don\'t understand why must they put micro herbs and dill on a hotcake?
A beautiful plate of Berries Ricotta Hotcake ($18.90) like this is definitely a welcoming sight to start the day. Love the lovely touch of lavander infused sugar. Not only does it adds colour, it elavated the overall taste. It feels like spring is here when tge hotcake is eaten together with the berries, sunflower seeds &amp; lavander infused sugar.üòçüòçüòç
Can\'t decide if I prefer this over the ricotta hot cake.
I have a feeling that it has made plans to run away from my tummy.
Hands down one of the prettiest looking pancake I\'ve seenüòÜ hahah I loved that it was fluffy at the same time, only wished that the ice cream was a lil larger in serving! Good to share for about 3-4pax
Curious is brought to you by the people behind Strangers and their menu is pretty much the same except it\'s more expanded than the one at Strangers. I\'m not very sure why the hotcakes are more popular here (but it\'s really just instaworthy) but the quality of the food here is pretty good, similar to the other sister cafe. I like that the space is big, airy and bright. Can definitely see myself coming back. Plus, they serve yummy coffee too ;)
I can\'t stop munching on this huge heap of crisp sweet potato fries ($14.90++) from Curious Palette. If only I could have more of that complementing truffle aioli dip.
Curious Palette is really huge! Love the space and definitly quite a great arena for instagrammers to play. Hotcakes were a bit too much though, even 2 people will struggle to finish one.
Yay to more places serving filtered brew coffee and this one was rather different from the ones I usually have. The coffee was much lighter and not as acidic as my usual choices are. Nevertheless, don\'t mind having more :)
In frame is the buttermilk waffles with gula melaka &amp; coconut cream $14.90, topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, azuki and roasted peanuts. Thank you @sethluicious for organizing! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Just the right amount of crisp and fluffiness, the buttermilk waffle was done perfectly as expected of the same folks behind Strangers\' Reunion. Though the compote was a little too sour for me, it was able to balance the sweetness of the vanilla bean ice cream and was quite refreshing on a whole.
Crisp batter encasing the soft starchy sweet potato strips. Served with their housemade aioli and a generous visible layer of truffle oil above the emulsion. Haven\'t tasted such delicious sweet potato fries, for as long as I can remember! 14.9bucks/serving #trufflefries
Sigh, no hint of truffle. It turned out to be rather tasteless, and the insignificant amount of tobiko did not provide the crunch. \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
The wine-poached pear can be more fragrant with a stronger spiced taste so it will bring out the flavour. And as always the waffles has just the right amount of fluffiness and crispy.
Best shared among three or more, Curious Palette\'s Ricotta Hotcake was really thick and gets a bit much halfway through. It kinda reminded me of a supersized version of the hotcakes from a popular fastfood chain but much prettier. With a hearty dose of syrup, my friend and I managed to finish about 3/4 yay! At $18.90, worth a try, albeit pricey~
The exquisite hotcake has a light crisp on the outside with fluffy yet firm texture on the inside. The interior was not flaky when you cut through it, and each bite tasted as good as it looked! Probably good for 3 to 4 to share though.\n<br />find out more from the link in my profile!

One of the hottest new cafes on the block, set up by the folks behind Strangers Reunion. Coffee was pretty good - no surprises there. Quite enjoyed my flat white although I heard the people at the table next to me quib about it being too bitter? Tables are a mite too close together but the space is pretty with a bright airy feel. Will be back to try their berry ricotta pancakes! #coffee
Nothing feels better with fresh fruits, and buttermilk maple syrup waffles. 
however what was laid before us was one very tiny winy piece, accompaniment by veges that tasted too raw for my liking. A pity.
Ist time came to this cafe, love the place ; tried their signature desserr (Berry Ricota Hotcake) ; the price quite expensive for a hotcake (18,9$)
Truffle fries were the saving grace of my meal at Curious Palette! The portion was generous and I like that they gave a lot of Parmesan. Truffle taste was not super strong but it came with truffle mayo dipping sauce. Will recommend ordering this side dish. 
The soft shell crab itself was pretty yummy, right amount of seasoning. However the dish could do more with more pieces of crab because the ratio of bread to crab was quite imbalanced. It was also rather pricey thus I would not order it again. 
The main that we ordered, the Curious Breakfast, is BAD. Very oily and the egg and hash were bitter because they were burnt. One of the worst brunches I have ever had. Luckily the hotcakes made up for it.
.\n<br />Berry Ricotta Hotcakes ( $18.90 ) - The hotcakes was somehow tacky and taste is only made better with syrup despite its beautiful &amp; colorful presentation.\n<br />Perhaps an ordinary looking McDonald\'s hotcakes will provide a much better satisfaction.
The waffle slays you with no mercy like you‚Äôre a stranger while the pears, possessing firmness and integrity, (wine-)party it up in dignified fashion like CBD blazered men at OverEasy on a Friday night, with the red slices being more rambunctious and wild. 4.3/5
I like that the hotcake came with very fresh and juicy berries, and it was not too dry. However it was super thick and became \"jelat\" after a while. The three of us had trouble finishing it. I would probably not order it again. Will try the waffles the next time round. 
Barely in business for half a month but Curious Palette has been making waves. The caf√©\'s exterior seems pretty obscure - only a chalkboard with \"Curious Palette\" in faint handwriting. The interior though, is a Hipstagrammer\'s paradise. We\'ll leave it to you to explore it for yourselves.
Loving the crunchy combination of pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, drizzled with maple syrup, but we would prefer a slightly crusty exterior. It\'s recommended to share this with 2-3 friends as the portion is big and might get heavy after a few bites.
The one I had was on their first day of soft opening, where I find it too dense on the inside but am loving the crisp edges on the outside plus the extra crunch from the sunflower seeds. Saw their brunch menu and now I\'m curious üíÅüèª
Dinner situation tonight: Truffled risotto ($17.90) and Beef Cheek Stew with Yuzu Foam ($27.90). The creamy risotto has freshly-shaved truffle, assorted mushrooms drizzled with truffle oil and Parmesan chips for a stronger flavour. As for the beef cheek, it is tender and juicy. But the grains might not be suitable for the local palate.
And it was a great choice to order their Berry Ricotta Pancake ($18.90) to share amongst 4 of us - gorgeous and fluffy, a definitely MUST ORDER! #burpple #curiouspalette

| Perfectly shaped light &amp; fluffy waffles paired with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberry compote &amp; granola. The people from Strangers did it right with the opening on Curious Palette - immersing yourself in natural light, upbeat indie mixes, your dose of Magic &amp; comforting food. A good place to sip a cuppa &amp; ponder about life or have a hearty conversation. \n<br />#Burpple #aroundwithamd #curiouspalette
The golden brown and crispy crust opens to reveal soft (yet non mushy) insides. What an indulgence on a Sunday morning!
Thanks to @alainlicious for the introduction, we\'re here right after a full-meal food tasting! Officially negated whatever calories burned this morning üòù Very very pretty place, hidden gem - you wouldn\'t even realise how spacious it is inside just from looking at its tiny storefront facing the main road.
Airy and fluffy as heck, with coconut cream and gula melaka (!!!), perfected with roasted peanuts and red bean. Winning. And the gorgeous interior makes it the perfect place for coffee and solaceüåù
First had this at Paddy Hills but I\'ve gotta say that CP does it better.  For starters the berries are fresher.  The cake centre is more moist and I like the fact that you control the amount of syrup you needed.  PH\'s version did use pine nuts though (vs sunflower seeds for CP\'s)
We had the soft shell crab burger and the pear poached waffles and as expected of Strangers Reunion\'s standard, their waffles are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside üòç
the pear seared waffle was extremely delicious with the right waffle batter used. the truffle sweet potato fries were served in a mountain load, as we exhausted ourselves in trying to finish them, very yummy nonetheless.
Beautifully plated, this dish tasted pretty much as good as it looked. The pan-fried trout was executed wonderfully with its crisp skin and flaky flesh that is cooked with a pinkish centre; the flavours of the fish strong but fresh, seasoned with salt. The berry compote, dried tomatoes, pickled shallots, artichoke, red radishes, roast potatoes were also pretty well-executed, a good play on flavours and texture which adds an interesting touch while they help to refresh the tastebuds if it ever gets too fishy (not for me though!).
Creamy and rich in cheese, this Risotto was truly a delight with the light truffle flavours and the plump assorted mushrooms which bursts it\'s earthy flavour when bitten upon. Very comforting on a cold day indeed. 
What a platter the Curious Breakfast is - the chorizo iberico slightly charred, bacon done to crisp/supple balance. More detailed review at Dear Babette.
They ran out of red bean, which would no doubt have gone well with the coconut.  Felt that the coconut cream came out quite strongly but not so the usually distinct taste of gula Melaka.  The lighting at Curious Palette is pretty conducive for food photography.
Anw this newly opened cafe is brought to you by the same folks of Strangers Reunion. Pretty extensive dinner menu, had the Truffle Risotto $16.90 and Truffle Fries $12. Both were decent, nothing out of the world. üòÅ
A brighter and cooler (literally colder) version of Strangers Reunion.  Great for the really hot weather we\'re experiencing.
The ang moh spaghetti had the strong aroma of Chinese cooking and the chilli oil helped further that Chinese vibe, but then the seaweed and moist shimeji mushrooms added a strong sense of konnichiwa to the proceedings. Elsewhere, the prawns were absolutely gargantuan in size, and probably need to be cut into three pieces each to be comfortably consumed. I enjoyed the pasta so much, I did not even mind all the pea action going on (and said action was hot and heavy, with all them hipster peas rolling around smirking at me and languidly flaunting their self-aware mushiness). 4.1/5 
Loved the presentation &amp; melt in your mouth texture! Probably my favourite of the lot! ($18.90)
Quietly launching itself along Prinsep Street is Curious Palette, a caf√© which currently serves mains and all day breakfast. Think Crayfish Linguine with Chilli Crab Sauce ($23.50), or their Curious Breakfast ($23) ‚Äî Iberico chorizo, Thai basil sausage, bacon, hash, artichokes, arugula, spicy tomato relish and a sunny side-up. You\'re in very safe hands when it comes to coffee here, go for their Flat White to enjoy a truly smooth, non-acidic cuppa. It is a joy to have such a good cup of coffee in town, what more in a lovely white-washed, light-filled space.
[NEW] [Dhoby Ghaut] [Soft launch: TODAY]\n<br />Anyone is curious what Curious Palette is offering? Wait no longer! They soft launched today, serving a similar menu to Strangers\' Reunion!
I had the flat white, by the way. Lovely, lovely coffee. 
Smoother than powdered shaved legs on silk.
I may be a little biased cos I love places that use Bonsoy soy milk, but this was a pretty wicked cuppa. Perfectly balanced! üëçüèªüëçüèª

The previous time that I tried it, the standards were not up to par due to the massive crowd for the Save A Stranger initiative, resulting in a dip in consistency. However, the decision to visit them again paid dividends and this time round, the hotcake came soft and fluffy, topped with a medley of berries and sunflower seeds mix with that all-important vanilla ice cream to cut through the \"heaviness\" of the entire dish. The honey syrup was the perfect formula to soak the entire thing in sweetness. Just like a colour palette, this dish was not only good to look at, it was damn yummy as well.\n<br />.\n<br />Curious Palette\n<br />Address: 64, Prinsep Street, Singapore 188667 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burppleSG #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #cafehopping #cafesg #curiouspalette #hotcakes

üíï\n<br />About 30 minutes waiting time. (The waitress already reminded me anyway.)\n<br />Not so crispy on the outside, fluffy in the inside.

can\'t imagine how I can finish this big bowl of instagram worthy hotcake alone especially when it\'s can be a lil heavy on the palette after a few mouthful of it. hotcakes were üëç well done fluffy and all with a cup of magic ‚òï :)!

üçì good to share but may be too much to finish alone. And altho i am not a fan of maple syrup, it does goes well with the pancake. And lastly it would be great if we can not 1 up like 3 scoops of ice cream üòú k i m greedy i know \n<br />Apologies for the lack of updates guys. Been really busy lately.

It comes with seasonal seafood, which despite being quite a lot, lacked of taste.
#SaveAStranger
With shredded cheese added and it is good for sharing!
Very thick and fluffy! Could do with more sauce/syrup/ice cream... I prefer the one at Paddy Fields more!
The pumpkin risotto was also creamy and goes well when paired with the chicken leg!
No introduction required. You guys know it better than I do üåûüåûüåû
But I still want to try the real thing from @toppaddock in Melbourne, heard so much good reviews!
looks better than it tastes and we fancied a larger scoop of ice cream to accompany the huge hotcake. (i\'d stick to paddy hills for my ricotta hotcakes hehe! üòõ) #burpple #vsco #vscocam #vscoeats #vscosg #igsg #sgig #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #cafeculture
Fried soft shell crab burger. The sauce could be a little more generous but generally a very filling and satisfying dish! 
The hotcakes were a hit with their soft fluffiness and mild sweetness. The Spam fries were pretty good as a pure savoury option. Queues can be quite crazy, I would suggest going around 6pm+ to avoid the crowd for dinner service. Or just wait it out, it\'s for a good cause afterall.\n<br />#hotcakes #berry #spam #fries #sgfood #sgfoodie #curiouspalette #sgcafehopping #sgcafe #burrple

best side was the burnt/ charred side!! Fluffy hotcakes but wished they were more generous w the ice cream. Nevertheless worth the 30 min wait!

Buttermilk Waffles with Red Bean, Crushed Nuts, Coconut cream and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream topped with Gula Melaka sauce. ($14.50)\n<br />-\n<br />I like waffles from Strangers Reunion. The same people at Curious Palette didnt disappoint too. Equally good waffles. Crispy on the outside, soft inside. Flavours were great together. Would be even better if there was a little more gula melaka. Haha. Definitely will be back in no time to try other flavours.\n<br />-\n<br />#food #foodie #foodpics #foodporn #foodphotography #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgcafe #cafe #waffles #prinsep #singapore  #curiouspalette #dessert

I was overwhelmed by his service and attitude. The interior design of the cafe was very minimalistic and i felt cozy the moment i step in. I was told that the hotcake would probably take about 20mins to be done since it is freshly made and hence i requested the milk tea cake to be serve together with the hotcake. The berry ricotta hotcake looks very delicious and fulfilling but however, i was quite disappointed as the hotcake tasted very normal and i was expecting it to be better. In conclusion, yes i would definitely come back again with the heart to try their waffles and ice cream. \n<br />Price overall: $27.54\n<br />Cafe rating: 4/5\n<br />Food rating: 3/5\n<br />Service rating: 4/5

Berry Ricotta hotcake [$14.90] with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, seasonal berries and a generous portion of pumpkin &amp; sunflower seeds.

Rich, savoury little cholesterol bombs. I loved these
However, I do like the use of coconut cream a dun Gula Melaka. Good quality gula Melaka always makes me happy and it managed to make my tastebuds very happy!  I\'ll actually go back for the ice-cream + coconut cream + gula Melaka rather than the whole dessert üòÇüòÇüòÇ #sgcafehop #cafehop #sgcafe #dessert #waffles #icecream #redbean #openricesg #nomnomsg #foodporn #burpple #whati8today #whatiatetheotherday

Throw in some spam fries to neutralise the sweet treats. Gotta say it\'s a tad overpriced for the hype. Not enough to rouse my tastebuds. 
Start the long weekends off with waffles and coffee.

~ \'ve got my mind set on fried chicken and peanut butter üòà... *evil thoughts*
This dish passes the test with almost  nonchalant ease.
Schlong = short long black\n<br />House Blend (Costa Rica and Ethiopian Yirgacheffe) \n<br />Double Ristretto + Water (~ 4oz)\n<br />Fruity aroma, bright acidity, spicy and winey aftertaste
House Blend (Costa Rica and Ethiopian Yirgacheffe) \n<br />Double Ristretto + Milk (~ 6oz) \n<br />Balance, full body and smooth aftertaste
The pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds provide the variation and balance to the overall toothsome flavour. To nitpick, a more generous serving of mixed berries will take the dish one step closer to perfection
I loved the texture of their buttermilk waffle, it had a crispy exterior and fluffy interior. And also good combination of flavours.

Apparently, the barista told me that they have changed the mocha\'s recipe.. üò™ Hope that they can use back the previous recipe.
+1 for the fried shallots.
Well spend my morning time with buddy in curious palette. Their berry ricotta hot cake is must try ! But gentle reminder, bring more friends to share the dish üòÖ

Don\'t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people\'s thinking. Don\'t let the noise of other\'s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary„ÄÇ\n<br />~ Steve Jobs
üò≥ Save for the togarashi soft shell crab, everything on the dish was just dazed and confused„ÄÇ
