No commitment needed. Happiness plate, Shilin tempura and sweet potato fries, tomyam chicken burger and Indian rojak for dinner. 
Tears it apart and dips into curry or sugar. While sauce sip into the crack of the Prata, it soften the crispy texture  but remained the buttery flavor. Fragrance, spicy and sweet!
The lard must be crispy to go with a good hokkien mee. Sadly, this was not!!!!
First local meal of the day! Misses local hawker food so much that I ordered almost everything from nasi lemak, fish soup, roti prata, fried chicken wings, char kway teow and fried bee hoon. Still short of carrot cake, satay and others.
our favorite breakfast place after a night of partying. the Q starts at 5am &amp; probably sold out by noon !
awesome plate of nasi lemak (coconut rice)!! the chicken wings is **slurp slurp**! but not too sure how they charge of the meal. different people, different price?! #justsaying
Lor Mee from Boon Lay Place for breakfast. Verdict?
Feels this is better ,rice is more fragrant,  nicer and cheaper ! Fried chicken , sotong , egg and vegetables for only $5! Stall name is xiangfeng nasi lemak! #sgfoodhunt #burpple #sgfoodporn #sgfoodie #sgfoodgram #sgfoodpic #sginstafood #foreverhungry #foodies #foodie #foodiecommunity #foodgram #foodporn #instafood #nasilemak #asianfood #singapore #whati8todaysg #wherei8todaysg #food

The fish is fresh, the soup is nice without MSG and the chilli sauce goes very well with the bowl. Highly recommended
$4
mee siam w long beans and fish fillet $3.2
the banana leaf nasi lemak
It comes with minced meat, meatballs and stewed mushrooms that was quite little for its pricing.
Ps. The main plate was for sharing I cant finish all! Overall: 3.5/5 #五香 #localdelights #localfood #boonlay #boonlayplace #sgfood #sgfoodie #food #foodie #foodporn #igdaily #burpple #burpplesg #throwback #latergram #qiangxxuan #note7

Tiong bahru Lor Mee.\n<br />Ironically at Boonlay.
😍(Phoenix curry rice) Super fresh ingredients used and value for money! 👍🏼😋 Love the prawns so succulent and crunchy! Queues can get long during meal time and they get sold out fast too! \n<br />#singapore #jiaklocal #sgig #igsg #eatoutsg #goodfriday #hawker #vscocam #vscofood #instafood #instagood #instadaily #igdaily #instatravel #foodporn #foodgasm #eathealthy #burpple #curry #weekend #tgif #dinner #8dayseat #travel #explore #travelgram #bbctravel #asia #asianfood #health
