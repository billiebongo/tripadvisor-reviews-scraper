Served warm, the heat allowed the fresh truffle to emit a heavenly aroma, and flavour the meat and rice grains even more intensely. Upon mixing the don up, you’ll discover a hidden surprise, an onsen egg, which melds all the everything together.  So much win!\n<br />. \n<br />More deets on @Izysingapore new menu is up on le blog
Scrumptious Kani, Uni, Otoro and Ikura cascading out of this maki roll. Each bite tasted of the ocean and was ah-mazing. 
Encased tempura shrimp and asparagus, they spread spicy crab mayo and avocado toppings over before baking and finally torched. Spicy yet creamy spread, it just goes well  on the roll
The Nokke Roll (S$38++) at @izysingapore is a flavour bomb of ikura, crab, negitoro and... #UNI. 😍😍 Which was fresh and sweet and SO GOOD. 😍😍 If I\'m not careful I\'m going to develop an addition to that creamy, delicious bright orange reproductive organ (yes, it is what it is). 😉 Oh and the roll part is below, a simple 6-piece cucumber maki. #Yummy! ✌🏼️#dinner #burpple #uniporn

Anago Tendon Set ($25)
Izy does a good lunch set which includes appetisers and desserts, well suited for the business crowd. The $30++ Steak Don was melt-in-your-mouth tender and well seasoned, with a perfectly runny onsen egg.  We finished off with a strawberry chilli sorbet with almond flakes and sweet cream, which was refreshing and light! The chili was very subtle and left a slight tingle on your tongue. The lunch set was a good sized, not too heavy to go back to work on. We sat at the bar and was impressed by exceptionally attentive service staff, not something you see often in Singapore. Thumbs up Izy!
Everyday should be Valentine\'s Day\"
This is in balsamic mayonnaise and soy caramel. It\'s not the sauce that makes this magical, it\'s how they fry these two pieces of chicken. The batter is thin and light, and retains all juiciness of the chicken 😋
I should also mention that the wagyu truffle don at Izy had an onsen egg hidden beneath the beef and truffles. Price varies from time to time, as well as the seasonal truffles used. Mine was S$40++ per bowl during dinner, and what\'s pictured is only half a bowl as they have taken the initiative to split our portion into two bowls when they know that we were sharing.
It is topped with real shaved #truffles. Truffle aroma fills the air the moment it\'s served. The beef are also well grilled with smoky flavour.
Gyudon with slices of Wagyu A5 beef, an onsen egg and loads of truffles. ($34++) The only flaw we could find in this dish was that it wasn\'t bigger. After a taste, it\'ll leave you begging for more.
Served in a cocktail glass, topped with fresh uni in a yuzu citrus sauce. This was mmmmmmm so good. 
Dip it in mustard and the black sauce(no idea what it is) then the onion. Very very tender and flavourful pork! 
Look at the slices of truffle! Truffle, tender wagyu beef topped on top of japanese rice w egg. Such bliss ☺️
Grainy photo because of the lighting. Got to love the quality of the food here. Tender wagyu beef, juicy pork, fresh salmon &amp; tuna!
The photo does not do this dish any justice by far. Possibly the best foie gras I\'ve ever had with this creamy Josper-grilled Foie Gras in Lime Balsamico Sauce and mango purée. Don\'t bother with the Omakase, go for this dish, chicken karage, grilled pigeon and the wagyu steak. Will not regret it! 
Bliss in a bowl. Generous servings of succulent, tender wagyu beef slices, with natural sweetness from caramelized onions and marinate, complemented perfectly with a shower of truffle oil. The egg adds creaminess and fullness to the dish. Each grain of rice has soaked up all the goodness, the juice, fat and flavour. Now all there is left to do is to try the original - Fat Cow. #heaven #foodporn #foodorgasm #addictions #guiltytreats #jizz

seriously. these are damn addictive. 6 pieces for one person really ain\'t enough. super crispy skin that isn\'t too salty (i\'ve got low tolerance level for salt) and yet each piece is so juicy, with meat falling off the bone easily and all you really want is to chomp down every little residual of whatever is left!
this may not appeal to most people but it was really good! the batter was so light, you\'d barely even notice the coating. the beef didn\'t taste as raw as it sounds, especially when you dip each slice into one of the three sauces that compliments the meat  @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie @singaporeeats @chopesg #chopesg @izysingapore #izysingapore @cachesingapore #cachesingapore #izakaya #katsu #gyukatsu #beefkatsu
of course, it doesn\'t come cheap, with a price tag of SGD45 but hey, just take a look at that overflowing amount of Uni, Ikura, Negitoro &amp; Crabmeat! i\'m very sure you would be begging for more after you\'ve licked the last roe off the plate 🍣

Beneath the wagyu is a soft boiled egg for you to prod, make the yolk ooze (always my favourite part, so fun!) and stir it all together for blissful #foodgasm 😋 #foodpics #foodporn #instafood #igfood #igfoodie #burpple #sgeats #foodie #eatoutsg #yummy #foodstagram
Slightly almost crisp and caramelised on the outside but melts in your mouth on the inside. #yummyheartattack #instafoodapp #burpple #foodporn #yummy #igfoodie #sgfoodie #foodgasm #foodpics
Wagyu Rice. Japanese rice served with seasonal truffles and boiled egg $40++. Happiness in a bowl. 
I can\'t think of anything about this dish that will leave your beef-loving spirit (if you have one) broken. A palatable, small but deep bowl of moist Japanese rice drenched in sweet soy, buried under strips of fatty wagyu, shaved seasonal truffles and an inconspicuously hidden soft-boiled egg. Sounds good? Does indeed. It also looks good, and tastes good. So it\'s easy to see why customers would come to this bar-restaurant just to order a bowl of \'gyudon\' only, we were told. 
lobster and scallop sashimi in an amazing broth 😍 #latergram #japanese #foodgasm #foodporn #instafood #instagood #instadaily #food #foodstagram #sgfoodies #igsg #sgig
The 7-course dinner set is fantastic. Will go for al la carte menu next time. Prefer the wagyu beef bowl. ;)) a bit pricy $145++
Excellent cocktails #singapore #cocktails #foodie
