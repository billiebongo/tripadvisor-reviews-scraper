Affordable Peranakan food with super good view. Their chicken cutlet, gourmet burger and most of the Peranakan food were super duper good. For more pictures, check out my bio link.
HAHA!
Featuring the Beef Rendang (SGD 10.80), Sambal Prawn with Petai (SGD 6.50) and Assam Fish Head Curry (SGD 35) which is the best among all!
Think $6.50 Nyonya Assam Pedas Fish or Sambal Prawn with Petai, order their $5 Chap Chye for a more balanced meal. ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™ŠðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ Sounds of spoons scraping the last of the zhup was heard, like scavengers looking for treasure! \n<br />More #accidentalhandmodel ðŸ˜‚
This spacious rooftop cafe situated on the 11th floor of Pico Creative Centre in Kallang not only has great panoramic views, but also serves tasty Peranakan food at a steal. Definitely go for their fantastic Nyonya Assam Pedas Fish ($6.50) â€” a generous portion of fresh fish lying in an addictive gravy that goes so perfectly with rice, and their incredibly flavourful Sambal Prawns with Petai ($6.50). They serve a variety of western dishes, brunch fare, coffee and cakes as well, but it\'s worthwhile to just focus on satisfying your Peranakan cravings here. A great place for cheap and tasty food, you\'ll be asking for more gravy please, and an extra plate of rice. What\'s more, no service charge or GST! Note that they are closed on weekends.
ðŸ˜± Where to find you tell me?! I demand that you guys must must go!Average rating for each dish 8.5/10. In case you are wondering, EVERYTHING here was digested in only one belly, the big tummy of Eileen Ong XT. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜… Going through a growing(erm...sideway) phase now.. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ #EileenWantsToCampHereForever #CafehoppingSG #SgCafe #PeranakanFood #JiakLocal #JiakHiddenGems #BurppleSG #Burpple #burppletastemaking
This is my 2nd visit here and the food is consistently good. Price is relatively cheap and worth it. The ambience here is also quite chill for holding a meeting.
5 Little Monkeys Cafe is a spacious rooftop cafe situated within the Pico Creative Centre in Kallang, catering to the office crowd in the building and nearby vicinity. While sandwiches, brunch fare, cakes and coffee are available, what you should wholeheartedly concentrate on is their  selection of mouth-watering Peranakan dishes that warrant repeat visits (once a week is recommended). Priced at only $6.50, their Nyonya Assam Pedas Fish is outstanding â€” a generous portion of fresh fish lying in an addictive gravy that goes so perfectly with rice. Also try their Sambal Prawns with Petai ($6.50), and ask for their special sambal sauce to add on if you\'re a real chili-lover!
The assam gravy is unbelievable â€“ a delirious mix of spicy and tangy that makes your lips purse pleasurably. Can you believe this serving costs just $6.50? You get so many slabs of fresh fish that you can take some and throw them at your mother. 4.2/5 
This was more delicious than I had expected. The fiery Assam gravy is a perfect balance of sour and spicy. Shiok to eat along with rice!
Really enjoyed this dish. Meat was soft, tender and fresh. The kind where you feel the texture with your teeth. Incredible value for money at $6.50. 
Unbelievably crunchy and fat, and the sambal was amazingly shrimpy and chewy to such a degree that it almost felt like a featured mini ingredient than a mere paste. The petai wasn\'t particularly stinko - perhaps thanks to the charms of the sambal, its controversy was reduced to a slight bitterness. This was $6.50 (!) without any imposed GST and service charge (!!) in a comfy and spacious cafe setting (!?!). Recommended for sure. 4/5
Was it worth it? Definitely. The food was thoroughly satisfying and at less than $10 a person, 5 Little Monkeys defines cheap and good.
How about a cafe that has gorgeous rooftop view, yummy peranakan food at wallet friendly prices?
The feeling when you\'re feeling lost but you kind of enjoyed it.

Nice chillax
Not too salty. Filling for lunch.
All for under $36, very affordable too. Remember to ask for the side of sambal belacan chili, too good to be missed!ðŸ™‹#TheKitchn #EileenWantsToCampHere #FiveLittleMonkeys #Peranakan #SgCafe #Burpple #BurppleSg #JiakHiddenGems #Brunch #Chicken #Flatlay
