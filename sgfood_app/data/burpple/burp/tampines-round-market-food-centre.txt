6 bucks gets you this awesome plate with a little of everything. Chilli could be better but overall still a good plate of noodles!
Bar chor mee is my all-time comfort food and I miss it soo badly when I\'m away from SG. But whenever I order a bowl to satisfy those craves, they are usually just satisfactory, or just... kinda get by. I mean how different can bar chor mee get? 
6am is too early for me to function, glad we found food here. Sarawak Kolo Mee ($5.50 including egg. I like their dumplings, not so for wanton which tasted bland. And their very qq noodles are quite yummy). Also ordered Prawn Pork Rib Noodles cos the porridge stall hasn\'t opened, boo. Taste-wise it\'s quite decent, soup was flavourful enough though not the best; huge portion (at least for me) so it\'s pretty cheap at only $3.
From Chai Chee Pork Porridge stall. Comfort food at its best. Not sure if I was eating without the minced pork or they were really generous with it - had so much pork and too little porridge towards the end😅
Perpetually with a bee line in front of its stall, Sarawak Kolo Mee is famous for its kolo mee in the round market. $4 can buy you a plate of kolo mee and a little of every ingredient - boiled and fried wanton, dumplings, char siew and braised pork ribs. To me, the winning formula here is the braised ribs sauce tossed together with the noodles. It is no wonder why I saw so many folks with the braised ribs noodles! The sauce was fragrant and tasty, without going overly salty. The kolo mee does remind me of Maggie noodles, only done a little thicker and slightly q q on the bite! 
This stall\'s pretty popular; don\'t expect them to go the extra mile to provide you with excellent service. It\'s my second time patronising this stall. The first happened a really long time ago. As with most lor mee, the starchy brown gravy makes the dish look very appetising, but always doesn\'t taste as good as it looks. My partner and I both agreed, however, that the fried fish was awesome, because it was really crispy. After this meal was done, our mouths stank for all the right reasons - I love my raw garlic. 
I might be biased since I grew up with this, but this is the best I\'ve tried so far (I haven\'t tried thaaat many tbh). Not sure why pig intestines are so addictive but I always attack those first. Tau kwa must always, always be braised long enough for it to taste good and for me it\'s one of the things that makes this dish. 
Sarawak Kolo Mee, pork ribs prawn noodles
The Long queue kolo mee. Still quite worth the queue. Very satisfying. Q noodles! Loveeeee the texture of the kolo mee 
Off to the wet market! It\'s been so long since I last stepped into a wet market.\n<br />The last time should be when I was a cute little tiny girl lol!
Bad kopi picture, didn\'t know I focus the background. [kopis] S$1.50 (# 01-11) - very comforting on this rainy morning.
Woke up at 6.30am to go to the market! [Wanton Noodles] S$3 (# 01-35)
From Teo Kee Mushroom Minced Pork store (#01-05).... The pork ribs so soft it melts in ur mouth. And love the well marinated chicken wings too. So nice!! 
Another kway chap! This one way better than the previous 😋😋😋 @nikefusion
What\'s #onthetable for breakfast this morning! What are you having for breakfast?
Classic toast with kaya and butter. Disappointed because I was hoping for the bread to be the traditional kind..😔
Good Saturday morning folks! I\'m out with my best friend and dad for breakfast today. Fried bee hoon for the dad - does it look like a heart shape to you? ❤
Usually I will opt for their usual set which comes with a whole lot of sides but for a change, this is pretty good too..\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#tampines#yummysarawakkolomee#sarawak#tampinesroundmarket#wantonmee#kolomee#noodles#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
This has to be our No 1 Carrot Cake!! 💕 Super Super love the $5 White carrot cake with prawns 🍤 and chilli🌶! His homemade chilli made with chilli powered is da best! This plate is just nice for 2 pax with plenty of eggs &amp; prawns... Super delicious and worth the Long Q! The friendly Uncle is the only 1 mending the stall.. so please be patient when Q.. He has to take order, fry the carrot cake, pack it, collect change from customer! So many task for him to handle! But he still give customer a big smile despite all that! 👍🏼 Kudos!

137 Lor Mee #01-09
3 veggies (S$2.50).
Super fragrant and yummmmy! You won\'t be able to find another stall who does it better than them!! 💞 u will just get hook to it for sure and you won\'t even want to eat other stalls of carrot cake after u taste theirs! This is how good it is!! ❤️👍🏼 Their Chilli is also very unique as they uses Chilli powder instead of Chilli paste thus the fragrant and special from others.. for this plate of $5, there\'s plenty of prawns in it, almost every 2 mouths, you can see the prawns..Super generous with the ingredients! Also, you can see they uses many eggs tooo!! Be prepared to stand and Q as there\'s only 1 Uncle who cooks n takes order.. my recommendation is, best to arrive before 11am as they might closes early at times.. So wakeup early for this plate of yummy carrot cake! Definitely worth the calories gain! @phusionade #songhancarrotcake #songhan #carrotcake #tampinesroundmarket

We went Tampines 137 Round market! Ordered their signatures dishes from the 2 signature stalls! Song Han Carrot Cake #01-07 - this plate is $5 white carrot cake with prawn (less 🌶) | Nasi Lemak Specialist #01-14 - Long Tong $4 &amp; Nasi Lemak (Mega Set) for $5! Super Super awesome food! Nasi lemak uses Basmati rice which is low is sugar apparently... cheap but very yummy food! Best to go before 11am before food runs out or stall close! #137roundmarket #tampinesroundmarket #nasilemak #longtong #carrotcake #songhancarrotcake #nasilemakspecialist
Sip the soup first and it was good! Seasoning from the pork and all is very prominent. And there\'s meat ball, mince meat, a dumpling and some condiments. Noodles are ok too.. pretty springy and the sambal added some kick. It\'s quite tasty but if I have a choice,  I\'ll stick with the conventional BCM😌\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#tampines#senghiangbakchormee#senghiang#tampinesroundmarket#bakchormee#bcm#noodles#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#localfood#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

The batter tasted very light that can also be dipped with 2 different curry sauces and coconut chutney!
Its always a satisfying thing to start the day. \n<br />#burpple #tamjiakteo #tamjiakcouplegoals #brekkie #7morning8morning #breakfast

The char siew is only passable lacking the carmalized charred. Overall the wanton mee lacks the depth to be considered as one of best.
Using the same noodle as the wanton mee, I find it more suitable to soak up the braised gravy of the chicken feet noodle. The chicken feet is also well executed with its crispy skin and braised to tender.
The char siew is only passable lacking the carmalized charred. Overall the wanton mee lacks the depth to be considered as one of best.
The amount of pork ribs and prawns here are acceptable and tasted not bad!

And the whole process starts again at 4am. #market #wetmarket #wet #roundmarket #round #tampines #close #process #night #morning #work
However, the redeeming factor for the Lor Mee here was the fried fish, which was fried on the spot, tasty and came in big quantities!
One of the best stall in Tampines to go to! 😊\n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
