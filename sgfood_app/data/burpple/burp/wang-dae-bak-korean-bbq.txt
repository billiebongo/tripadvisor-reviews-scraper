#100happydays K-BBQ~ Here\'s to good food comas (๑¯◡¯๑) #burpple
Love the Korea style deco.  The beef cuts are simply awesome and the pieces just simply melted in my mouth.
I guess they are better for their grilled meats
The vermicelli is too springy and hard to bite off. Is lacking of taste, and the serving portion is small (S$8).
(S$36).

Good for sharing between 5-6 as it is really filling, a bit overdoing for 2 pax. 😋
Location: @wangdaebakbbq 98 Amoy Street, Singapore 069918\n<br />.\n<br />#wangdaebak #koreanbbq #sgkoreabbq #wangdaebaksg #burpple #burpplesg

Most lunch sets below $12 with free flow appetisers! #howtonotbefat #burrple #wangdaebak
Made sure to eat less rice so I could finish all the meat :3
Still the electrifying ambience fit to contain rambunctious laughters within does serve it\'s purpose in making the #koreanfare that much more palatable
Before 10% lunch discount.\n<br />Truly a daebak deal for one of the best Korean restaurants in Singapore. The seafood soup was not salty and I didn\'t detect any hint of msg. The beef was super generous portion as well. The pajeon (pancake, non-crispy variety) had a great smoky note. Will be back for the BBQ next time!\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #koreanfood # #sgrestaurant #burpple
super good meal at #wangdaebak tonight! 😍
😘
The bother to chit chat with the customers as well and their waiters are super friendly. #cheryleatsalot #burpple
I like the fact that they used charcoal for the BBQ portion and that you do not need to queue for a long time during dinner service. We ordered beef and pork. The marinated meat were very tasty. Staff needs to be slightly more responsive as we were not served with side dishes or water even after we place our order.  Price wise since it\'s ala carte ordering, don\'t expect buffet price.
