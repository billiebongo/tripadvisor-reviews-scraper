Had a meaningful time catching up with @fionatingx over an omakase lunch at Morsels yesterday.\n<br />Our meal was served in sharing plates and apportioned for two. In total, we had five small plates and a couple of bigger bowls between us. \n<br />First to arrive, right after our drinks (these were not included in the omakase price) were the devilled eggs with smoked crabmeat and house-cured duck prosciutto, and oysters with kumquat shrub and pickled kaiso seaweed. I loved the former and could have easily gobbled up more. The latter had a pleasantly sweet taste and the freshness of the oysters was indisputable but truth be told, they\'re rather small. Hopefully, it was just a one-off kind of thing.\n<br />Morsels\' new Dempsey location is in a quaint old building with an interior that will surely charm with its warmth and character.
Finally tried Morsel\'s brunch menu. Here they do their own unique take on the Swedish smorrebrods, which essentially is a sandwich with cold cuts. This came with a chinese styled braised pork belly,\n<br />braised peanuts,braised egg and apple cauliflower kimchee. The eggs were more like ramen eggs where the yolk is still a little runny. Everything tasted wonderful together. My only gripe is that the portion is too small. It\'s barely enough for me. I had to order other sides to supplement it. This isn\'t really good value at $22 for a plate. I think I will just stick to their regular dinners for now and I won\'t be back for their brunch.
Headed to the newly-relocated Morsels for dinner for tonight\'s Burpple Tastemaker Eatup ‚Äî Morsels had since moved out of their Mayo Street premises and into Dempsey; it takes up the spot formerly belonging to La Fondue (which coincidentally was also one of the first few locations where I had a Burpple Tastemaker Eatup quite a number of years ago). Morsels had also started serving an all-new weekday lunch and weekend brunch menu at their new location; the latter having pretty interesting items such as \"Miso Kaya French Toast\" that sounds pretty interesting to check it out.
The Kasu-cured Kuhlbarra Barramundi was beautifully juxtaposed by the crispness of the pulut hitam cracker and the salinity of the protein was balanced by the acidity introduced from the bok choy pickles. All you need is a glass of BK Rose 2016 to pair it harmoniously. \n<br />Catch them all at upcoming Wine Fiesta!
From Morsels at the 9MCM popup this year running from 20 to 21 June. Apparently the Otah Noodles were a good concept though tasted a bit ordinary, but the Taco seemed a tad unrelated to the dish and the whole idea just didn\'t really felt like it come together.
Lovely date at Morsels. Small plates but thoughtful menu. The best dish is not even in the picture because it was so good we forgot to shoot! - steamed clams in fig broth.
Morsels fans know that when a basket of sliced baguette is set on the table, it\'s time for the star of the show. There will be many, many highlights, but this is the one that will hush the table and draw out the most animalistic ramen instincts - major slurps abound, more bread is ordered to clean up the bowl so completely it can skip the dishwasher after. We have many heritage dishes that are cultural treasures, and Morsels is a local gem that, with its clam and fig broth, has added to the modern annex of that storied lineage. It\'s one of the best dishes in Singapore created by two of our very own, an elixir of extravagant intricacies that defies introspection - it\'s tough to place a finger on what exactly enriches that broth to Gatesian levels, except that it unleashes warm fuzzies in a way the surrounding Little India spices can\'t. With major tongue action lavishing its velveteen and silky body, it\'s the broth-el of pleasure.
New intimate small plates resty in lil india that offers a unique creative american menu and honest food made with love. Def my fave kind of food. Highlights: firecracker pork pasta with habanero sauce &amp; sour cream, clams in fig broth, grilled octopus on squid ink &amp; salted egg sauce. Portions are really morsels-ish and food comes out slowly but oh so delish!
a few years back, i would never have touched innards, tongue and whatnots. now that i‚Äôm a changed person, i can at least appreciate a good Beef Tongue on Yaki Onigiri üêÆüçô when i taste one! of cos, there will always be meats i would ever take but that‚Äôs for another time ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n<br />.
and no, it‚Äôs not the workings of the Goma Dressing though of cos, that only complemented the dish further .

the Onsen Egg was definitely on point. you can tell how good it is when you mix and eat everything together. .
(almost) life-changing - i know this cos i don‚Äôt usually think of the same dish days after i‚Äôve had it unless it is THAT good. literally melted in my mouth üòã .
That said, you wouldn\'t wanna share it anyway because the Grilled Mangalica Pork Rib Eye Steak and the American Wagyu Flat Iron Steak are delicious! Save it for special occasions as the bill will come up to about $150 for 2 with drinks.

Despite being slightly sweet, I find myself thoroughly enjoying the fragrant glutinous rice
The best part of this dish is surely the grilled sri lankan prawn.. And I saw the ala carte menu had a dish with only the prawns.. Go for that instead

It has hints of savories from the umami and the kimchee, saltiness from the clam brine, and sweetness from the fig.  It came with slices of toasted bread to soak up all the goodness of the broth.  We almost ordered another set so we didn\'t have to share.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Morsels, Dempsey, Singapore\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#foodie #mychefstable #foodporn #sgfoodie #iphonography #pinoyfoodie #leica #foodbeast #foodstagram #thefoodspotter #yummy #foodgram #feedfeed #goodeats #brunch #buzzfeast #food #clams #delicious #foodcoma #foodgram #forkyeah #foodphotography #kimchi #broth #instagram #burpple #seafood #foodlover #unami
