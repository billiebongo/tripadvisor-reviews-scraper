Love the crumble but then again I have never eaten crumble I didn\'t like (unless it was too soggy) Beneath the thin layer of crumble - yes I wish there was more crumble - was well-sliced pieces of apple drenched in sugary sauce. 
Look at the cheesy, creamy goodness! Absolutely delish, but it can get really heavy after eating it halfway. Not for anyone watching their waistline, but so worth it for the beautiful smell of truffle. 
Super disappointing since it was overly drying (maybe too much salt), soggy (way too much oil) which made eating it almost impossible for me. Wouldn\'t order this again, and the truffle isn\'t very strong either. :(
Forgot what the pasta dish was (my friends ordered it) but they said it was okay, but the portions were really big. One friend felt it was the best dish, while my other friend and I agreed that the Mac and Cheese stole our hearts. 
in love with the soft brioche crusted with cereal.
Can\'t resist a good BBQ pulled pork burger.
Super milky and creamy! Only for cheese lovers üòä Strong scent of truffle too  :)
Finally found a legit mac and cheese! Besides smelling delicious (truffles ftw), it\'s got a creamy and lovely texture, thanks to the power combo of cheese and, surprise, mushrooms. $20.00++. Well worth it, will be dreaming about it until next time.
Thanks woman @vswellness for being there in times of crisis and for helping me snap put of my mindless obssessions. Have loads of fun but please please please take good care of yourself in SL!
Garlic, chili, bacon, shrimp perfectly tossed in al dente pasta. Feisty like the menu says!! Satisfying
2 fat crab cakes and a chunk of brioche topped with roasted asparagus and a poached egg drizzled with hollandaise. This dish also came with a side of salad. The crab cakes were fleshy and creamy, which paired well with their crunchy deep fried exterior. I also liked the roasted asparagus, which had developed a nutty flavour from roasting. A hearty, filling brunch.
This IMO is the best truffle fries I have so far. I like the fact that the fries are hand cut and prepare fresh daily. The skin of the potato isn\'t removed and this makes the fries even üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº!
 Deep fried risotto balls with cheese! Yummy! But if only the filling is replaced with prawns or octopus and it would be great! Hehe...then it will become the ang moh version of the Takoyaki! Lol!! 
French toast can be great on its own, but paired with fried bananas, stuffed with Nutella and drizzled with chocolate sauce ‚Äî the toast at Little Diner is taken to a whole new level. They also do it a little differently by giving their toast a cereal crust, resulting in a crunchy exterior that gives way to a warm, soft middle. This Stuffed Super Cereal-Crusted French Toast ($16.50) is not to be missed, and is equally great for hogging and sharing!
Very worth the $15 price tag! Asked the waitress if I could change the baked beans to something else and it was replaced with mushrooms! The toast was buttery and fluffy on the inside. Scrambled eggs were so-so, not as creamy for my liking. The potatoes were cooked with pepper and some other herbs, my friend who had it said that it was really good!
Appetizer\n<br />Golden Risotto Balls \n<br />A great dish to have during a cold nite, as it so hot and cheesy inside.
This is the smaller of two portion sizes that they offer, priced at $9 (or available as an upgrade from the side of fries on their various mains for additional $5). The handcut fries with skin were moist and fragrant, it was evident they were generous with their truffle oil üòã the fries were adequately salted by the cheese alone and was very rustic. Definitely a staple when you\'re at little diner, great as a starter. I reckon the small portion could satisfy groups of 2-3 and groups larger than that should get the larger portion.
The chicken meat resembled popeye\'s, but the parts with skin melted in the mouth. The honey drizzle was a welcome complement and added to the fragrance of the dish. I didn\'t like the pickled coleslaw though and felt it didn\'t fit in with the rest. Comes with two big chicken parts and a side of fries not pictured, and is really filling. Fairly good, but not \'wow\' great. 
The clams come with the option of a \'drunk\' or \'sober\' sauce, the first being a white wine sauce and the second being a tomato variant. I had the white wine clams, and this was the star of the night for me! ‚≠êÔ∏è the clams were cooked just right, not too raw nor rubbery. The bacon bits were a delightful addition to the absolutely savoury sauce. I made sure I got a taste of the sauce with every bite, and even used the garlic bread to soak it up and attempted to drink it as soup oops.... Highly highly recommended. 
A salad that\'s very generous with its ingredients (outside of rocket and lettuce). A choke-load of roasted walnuts, perfectly poached pears and dried cranberries. The smoked duck was just right and not cured to the point of over-saltiness and dryness, so that was really great. Overall a very well-balanced salad!! 
$16.50. We actually ordered version 2.0 (with truffle oil &amp; mushrooms) but they got our order wrong oh well. Cheeeeeesy creamy goodness. We shared this dish so I\'m not sure if it\'d be too gelat for one.
$13.50. Their take on this Texan classic was without the usual beans, &amp; a thick layer of cheeeeeeese. Also it wasn\'t too spicy, nor greasy with tasty chunks of beef. This dish was obviously meant for me with the lack of beans abundance of cheese and mild spicinessüòÇ we ate this with our fries and turned it into chili cheese fries so shiok. Would\'ve preferred if the beef chunks were smaller / minced but then again this appetizer feels quite value for money with the amount of meat.
This was the side that came with my buttermilk fried chicken. Actually added $5 to upgrade from normal fries, kinda pricey but we probably wouldn\'t be able to finish the full sized one anyway. these fresh handcut fries were pretty good - so tasty, soft on the inside &amp; rightly crisped albeit a little too greasy. probably one of the nicer truffle fries I\'ve had. (We added our Chilli con carne to this and made our own Chilli cheese fries. SO SHIOK)
Tender juicy chicken with a super crispy batter &amp; honey (wish there was more of the honey sauce) This was so good I had to ignore the grease. And nope I didn\'t feel too guilty after finishing the entire dish. This was $18.50 (inclusive of fries which was served before this as the chicken is fried on the spot and requires some time)
This version 2.0 of mac &amp; cheese had a subtle truffle smell when arriving. Baked to golden brown came as an enticing treat to the eyes. Filled with mushrooms like shitake, macaroni and of course lots of cheese! Super comfort food!
I haven\'t tired beans from toby estates. So when Little Diner proudly serves beans from there, i think i gotta try! Wasnt disappointed at all!
Was so psyched to try these pancakes after hearing about it for so long but I am really upset to say that it did not make the cut for my best pancakes list )-: cream cheese did compliment the pancakes well but the pancakes were not exceptionally tasty or satisfying! So this shall go to the dessert section )-: 
I love this place. Really attentive service, casual environment. I ate with my fingers!
The best ribs my bf and I have tasted in Singapore. It\'s a pity they don\'t have this dish all the time...
Awfully juicy, not for those who do not like the gamey taste of lamb. SUPERB!
a fried banana for accompaniment. crispy exterior, soft and fluffy interior \n<br />to me there\'s no better brunch place than here. coming back this quaint cosy little diner with great food and service. a change of menu from my last visit
Golden Crabcake Pillow with a little Chipotle Aioli, Crispy Bacon, Grilled Asparagus, Poached Eggs &amp; Hollandaise Sauce on Toasted Brioche with side of Baby Green Salad SGD$19.50
This is not your ordinary ham &amp; cheese sandwich. This is a deconstructed, gussied up\n<br />ham &amp; cheese sandwich on toasted brioche, sitting in a pool of truffle scented bechamel sauce, topped with a beautiful fried egg. Side of Baby Green Salad. SGD$13.50
Last night\'s dinner at Little Diner for @ryeohyunelf\'s early birthday celebration! On a sidenote, this Seoul Piggy Burger is soooooo good! Sauce was awesome!
Taking the ubiquitous french toast to a new level - this was super crispy and filled with nutella! Topped with caramelised bananas as well | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
These huge chicken thighs were so tender and juicy! They were lightly seasoned, and coated in a thin, crisp batter. I didn\'t mind the light tasting chicken (because they were sooooo juicy) but I think it would go better with the subtly sweet honey sauce if it were saltier. I found the homemade coleslaw to be an acquired taste, because it was spiced rather strongly. Very different from the usual, sweet and creamy coleslaw. This came with a humongous side of fries too (not pictured).  
This generous portion of fries came with my buttermilk chicken. As the chicken takes 20min to prepare, they served me my fries first so that I could eat something while my friends had their main courses. The Little Diner makes its own fries from scratch, and they did a great job. They left the skin on, which made the fries more crispy!
Warm and moist amalgamation of banana and Nutella in prata-like Quesadilla. A dessert that can find a place in my full stomach. 
Okay I can\'t remember the exact name of this dessert D: but it was great because even with all the sweet items it wasn\'t overly sweet! It was crispy and gooey, but maybe not something one person can finish without being overwhelmed!
Definitely didn\'t regret following Jia Xuan\'s decision to get this burger! Was filling for all 7 of us. Really sweet bread and thick patties with amazing thick cheese, worth the money!
The truffle fries tasted great with the herbs and all, the salad was refreshing as well, liked how the walnut came together with the smoked duck and sauces! Quite big portions and worth the money!(:
The truffle fries were not too salty but could have been more generous with the cheese. The smoked duck in the salad was definitely my favorite part of the dish. 
Back here again for the red velvet pancakes. What I ing unique is the cream cheese ice cream that accompanies it :) 
Super decadent! I loved the fried banana and the French Toast brioche had crust cereal on the outside but warm and soft on the inside :) but not something I\'d tackle on my own tho. Thankfully had two lovely ladies to share with :)
:-) Ordered mac and cheese and truffle fries!! They were really good :) def going back there for my red velvet pancakes ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The crimson discs of griddled batter are nice on their own, but the real lead actor here is the accompanying ball of oh-so-lush cream cheese. 
Poached eggs and hollandaise on thick brioche, with salad, bacon, grilled baby asparagus and crusty crabcakes on the side. Very worth the $16.50 price tag. 
Technically a Madame because there\'s an egg, but really, who cares about formalities when it tastes as good any way. The short stack of brioche, ham and stringy Swiss cheese baked in an ultra-rich truffle oil-tinged bechamel sauce, with a sunny-side-up leaking over it, is by far the best croque Monsieur, or interpretation of it, that I\'ve had. 
Hand-cut chips with skins on have so much more flavour. Not enough truffle oil, though. 
but back at my fav haunt to satisfy someones red velvet craving. personally what i like most is their butter cream spread.
Buttermilk Fried Chicken. The best part of any fried chicken is the crispy skin with its veil of crunchy batter, and this was no different, though the succulent flesh was just as impressive. With a drizzling of maple syrup, this made an immaculate sweet-salty main. #chicken #fried #battered #buttermilk #maplesyrup #americanfood #comfortfood #foodporn #sgfood
Tenderloin Steak &amp; Prawns with Mashed Potato. Tasty beef, though the medium-rare cook faded into a rare as we ventured into the middle - had to have it sent back for a few more minutes over the stove. #surfnturf #beef #tenderloin #steak #prawns #grill #foodporn #sgfood
A tad too oily, but worth the price ($18.90) as it comes with tiger prawns. Came here in hopes of giving their Red Velvet Pancakes a try but they only served it for brunch on certain days. Do ring them up if you\'re thinking of trying the pancakes too! 
Sunday morning brunch at Little Diner - Crabcake Eggs Benedict with Toby Estate\'s coffee. Generous serving and not overpriced
Priced at $13.50, this stack of 3 red velvet pancakes come with addictive homemade cream cheese frosting, and are the perfect complement to the large serving of truffle fries you know you\'re going to have. Great for those who simply love red velvet! Photo by Keng Wee Tan.
Love how potatoey the fries are! It kinda taste like heaven! üòçüòçüòç
Huge serving of prime ribs that is not on the menu. 
Huge portion, fresh buns, shredded bbq pork with truffle fries. Delicious!! 
The only australian beer that make it into little diner. Peachy cidery taste with a tinge of lemon. Best beer i\'ve drank so far. Must try if u love fruity beer.
Warm and delicious crepe. You can never go wrong with banana and Nutella together 
The toast was perfect. Perfect toast with perfect scrambled eggs , perfect bacon and perfect sausage 
Delicious red velvet pancakes. The pancakes were warm and fluffy with the right amount of taste. Highly recommended!
The crab patty was not bad. Eggs was poached nicely and the bacon is crispy! Worth a try if you are in the mood for something crabby *cues spongebob 
Super awesome cheesy ham and cheese with egg. A definite must try!
ill never get sick of this place cuz its one of de best brunch places .. this new dish is really good!
Asian-American favourite pork patty burger with chilli sauce and asian-slaw.
Easily the best Bread Pudding we\'ve ever had! Unforgettable! Warm, soft, moist and soooo good! Tiramisu was alright (sorry it\'s cropped off this pic.) but save your stomach for the former ;)
Our \'thank you gift\' - some candies, mini cookies and a discount voucher for return visit. Such sweet and thoughtful people, aren\'t they? My favourite Restaurant Week experience this year :)
My friend\'s main course, which was really good too. I got to try the fried couscous cake, liked it! ;)
This was HUGE! But not too tough at all, juicy and lightly salted with a slight smokey flavour... just couldn\'t finish it, such a pity.
I love this place! Cosy ambience, warm &amp; friendly staff, good hearty food, sweet personalised gestures (like this placecard!) Totally worth travelling to the slightly inconvenient location :)
Ran 5km today. Figured I can give myself a treat #littlediner #foodporn

Tried the Smokey Mac &amp; Cheese, and we loved how the slices of salty chorizos blunted the gelat-ness of the cheese.

Naturally I am always a little miffed when swanky restaurants charge high prices for tiny morsels of fish (ahem Bread Street Kitchen), but at Little Diner, notwithstanding its name, there\'s nothing diminutive about their Irish [Mikey\'s Fish and Chips] -- truly satisfying indeed.
[Little Diner] is a cozy and homely American-styled eatery serving excellent fare -- so I will be introducing a number of their dishes over the next few days.
A beef patty with melted Swiss cheese and topped with bacon of many forms - strips, jam, aioli. Rejoice! Fortunately or unfortunately, I am also beef lover and the patty was too dry for my liking. üôÅ
