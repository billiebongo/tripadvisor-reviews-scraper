Toasted marshmallow ice cream with brown sugar ice cream. Imagine extra sweet Haagen Dazs French vanilla sandwiched between yummy soft and chewy cookies. A bit on the high side but worth every single dollar. I\'m looking forward to trying a few more of their other flavours.
My meats met my greens that day.\n<br />And I fell in love.
Also, beef was overcooked today. After a few trips, I think the salads need a bigger portion of sauce.

When will I ever get to try their soup and dory with fruit rub? Seems like I don\'t have any fate with either. Do find their olive rice very savoury and appetizing!
Eating here has ensured that I\'m getting a balanced diet. Look at how huge the serving of my butter seared dory is!
Finally! I was actually surprised by how small it was but I guess a lot of money goes into the pretty packaging. The tiramisu was perfectly moist!
Really enjoyed dining at this place. Maybe next time I\'ll have dessert along with my salad!
Good place for carnivores to slowly convert to omnivores. And really affordable too, ranging from $9.90 to $11.90 a salad. I will definitely be back!
My favourite DIY salad place to go to because of the great range of topping selections, homemade dressings and seasonings, plus delicious meat pairings! Bonus points from me because it\'s nearby to school. Here I\'ve selected the Terriyaki Chicken and the Perky Sesame Ginger dressing. Having a DIY menu makes it really fun because I want to go back to try to find the best combination of toppings, meats, and dressings that I can call my own!
Salad + 5 toppings + 1 dressing = $7.90!\n<br />Had grapes, cherry tomatoes, pineapples, parmesan cheese and carrots. Good place to go considering the beautiful concept of a lawn. Good place to eat at considering how easy it would be to have a healthy meal!
At my favourite salad place again :D the prawns really burst in your mouth with flavour! Try their spicy dressing! Really gives you a kickkkkk!
At The Lawn, \"Meat your Greens\" is the motto, and what better way to have salad than a perfectly grilled piece of dory or duck breast to keep you satisfied. With every salad, you can select 5 topping and a grilled item. Favourites include Pacific Dory with Fresh Fruit Rub &amp; Herbs, and the Grilled Salsa Duck for the Biopolis outlet. If you\'re at the Shenton branch, go for the Char-grilled Garlic Prawns. The one thing that truly stands out here is the portion size, no need to worry that you\'ll be hungry after this salad!
Being a good friend and fervent supporter of The Lawn means that I still eat at my favorite salad place despite the big boss being out of town holidaying away.. @zeyanlim bro enough or not?
Eating healthy for lunch. Butter dory with onions, grapes, olives, buttered corns and green apple cubes. Had the manly mango dressing which taste sweet! 
Chose the citrus dressing for my salad today. Very healthy-tasting, but unfortunately I felt it was too mild. As usual, it was a tummy-filling, heart-satisfying salad.
Though dory fish doesn\'t capture the flavour of the marinate very well. The other meats are beautiful. I must say this is the best salad place in Singapore!!
Having my amazing grill+salad combination @ The Lawn, with @cherielove! Come visit!
$13.40 for butter seared pacific dory (classic) and aceto balsamico beef cuts (premium) on your greens
Unfortunately the standard at The Lawn seemed to have dropped. Hope that it\'s just a one-off during peak weekday lunch time.
Happy birthday Grace! Healthy and delicious Burpple lunch in your honor. üòä
I am too excited to get started on this! Only S$9.90 for such a HUGE portion! :D
Brunch: Grills with a whole lot of fibre goodness underneath. #foodporn #instadaily #salad
Still the same, nice food and nice place.
It may not look it, but the bowl is pretty deep &amp; my jaw dropped when the waiter served my DIY salad because I didn\'t expect it to be so huge.... 
Not a salad person but this was pretty alright!
Trust me when I say that this $9.90 bowl of goodness will make you super full üòù\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#eatoutsg #instafood_sg #sgfoodporn #burpple #hungrygowhere #sipandgulp #singaporeinsiders #thelawncafe #eatclean #saladporn

Best part is getting to choose the ingredients (basic salad with 5 toppings, 1 dressing for $7.90). I need meat in my salad so I opted for the additional grilled meat
Been here twice in 3 days, says a lot for someone who doesn\'t like her greens! üòú
Finally got to try The Lawn today and I must say, I absolutely love it! Gonna foresee myself coming back here real soon! üòçüòçüòç
