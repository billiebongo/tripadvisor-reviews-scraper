Not the prettiest dish, but the Flavours are to die for.
Top: Pork chop milanese w tomatoes and ruffle mayo ($32).. meat taste bland and stiff.. definitely not worth the price..\n<br />Bottom: Tagliolini w crab and Nduja ($24) the crab meat and Pork fuse well with the pasta and sauce..will recommend this instead...
I\'m not a fan of creamy pastas but this is one true exception - if you\'re a fan of seafood and specifically, urchins. This is carbonara with a gorgeously decadent layer of sea urchin sabayon (lightest texture ever, with the richness that is UNI) - it\'s the best ever, seriously! 
I started mine with a really tasty Wagyu beef ravioli with roast jus, great beef in thin pasta skin on a really flavourful sauce. Just too good a way to start the weekend, especially with live band music for the meal. #burpple
Located right smack in the cbd area, it offers affordable lunch sets. We had the Tagliolini, Crab &amp; Nduja pasta. Pasta was well coated with the rich sauce. It was simply tasty!
From noon to 2:30pm on weekdays, this China Square joint serves up a special lunch menu of hearty lunch classics, all priced at an affordable $13.90 and below. The crowd favourite is, without a doubt, the Spaghetti Carbonara with Homemade Guaniciale ($10.90). Expect a huge serving of al dente spaghetti wearing a luscious sauce and tossed with fried shrimp, bacon and a soft boiled egg. Portions are very generous, so be prepared for a food coma. Take the long route back to the office, or save this for when the big boss is out.
Used The Entertainer for this - Grilled Grass-fed Beef Sirloin Tagliata ($36) and Wagyu Beef Cheek with Roast Peppers. The sirloin looked great but tasted a little too dry, and @g.165 thinks they could use a little more seasoning. Both of us weren\'t a fan of the soggy salad. \n<br />My wagyu beef cheek fared so much better imo! It was honestly more like Beef stew with how darn tender it was and all that gravy. Served with creamy mash potatoes and roasted peppers (also overcooked but quite tasty), portion was quite huge so this was pretty worth my $$.
The ribs themselves are tasty enough, but the butter potatoes (and caramelised onions) are simply divine. Yum!
Pretty good, but would probably go for other items in the future.
Suggested for sharing - too much for one. Decent though, not too sweet. Went nicely with the salted caramel and figs. 
This looked more appetizing than it actually was. The Uni taste was way too subtle, though the cod was succulent. 
Very affordable and portion is huge! Would love a little more meat on it but I\'m not complaining for the price 😋 would love to try something new the next time!
The cannellini played it like a cross between cheesy pasta and baked beans, whilst the thigh gap-challenged duck provided greasily familiar entertainment in its KFC-esque boudoir. 3.4/5
Essentially sweet and mildly oinky jumbo prawns which possess a certain home-cooked charm, the only difference being that they taste like they were prepared using Sixth Avenue oils. 3.7/5
$10.90++, portion was quite huge - insane amount of pasta. It was creamy and flavourful despite minimal ingredients, al dante, but gelat towards the end. Will come back but probably won\'t order this again. Carbs overloadddddd.
Thought these were a little disappointing :( oh wells! Most of their other stuff are pretty good though! #foodie #foodporn
The Mushroom it is like Enoki Mishroom but the restaurant owner uses enoji mushroom slightly thicker &amp; stir fried with potatoes. the food is still tastable hopefully they will stil maintain the standard cos the taste is very bland the salmon is grilled to perfection.
The Pasta I Ordered is  Spaghetti Carbonara with Homemade Guanciale. The pasta i say  unique is there i found a Soft boiled egg inside. Topped with bacon &amp; crispy fried dried shrimp it is good &amp; the price is reasonable &amp; the portion is big. cost u only $8++. Fyi All these menu available on Weekdays lunch hrs frm 1200 to 1430hrs.
Lighty tangy, creamy, and full of seafood goodness, this Crab Nduja pasta is nothing short of amazing. I try not to eat too much carbs and pasta, but this I\'d always make the exception for.
Went to &amp;Sons for the first time earlier this week and was much impressed by their food, which is a winsome combination of big Italian flavours and not-so-common ingredients, which keeps the menu accessible and familiar, yet intriguing at the same time.
kurobuta pork neck, asparagus, cheese platter, baccala cakes with uni cream etc. etc. 
Can\'t get enough of them baccalá cakes with sea urchin sabayon!
The foolproof staples: \n<br />Homemade salami and prosciutto ($18 for the mixed platter, five types of cured meats)\n<br />Superb baccalá cakes with an indulgent velvet-like sea urchin sabayon ($15 - be sure to get some bread for the mop up!)\n<br />Lip-smacking crab and nduja tagliolini ($10, the very dish that got me hooked on this place)\n<br />Ridiculously tender veal ossobuco with orzotto ($22, not in the picture). 
Al Dante noodles! Can\'t complain much for the price and service!
My first experience here was that of excellent food &amp; service and today these were non-existent.  Let\'s talk about the food first. Almost everything we ordered were too salty, especially the prawn cioppino which was Exceedingly salty!  It was like downing salt water after durian; If only we had durian.  The wait staff asked us how the food was and received our feedback on the saltiness.  The response was an unconvinced \"really?\" and NOTHING more.  The wait staff congregated and chatted amongst themselves and did not bother to come clear the plates or refill the water and only bothered to come up-sell desserts. We were the ONLY customers in the restaurant.  Won\'t be going back anytime soon that\'s for sure.
Value for money lunch deals! Portions were huge and the food was pretty decent 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Here\'s the dish that keeps making me come back for more. Very well made and cooked Baccala with uni sabayon ! Has to be the best dish on their menu..
Should anyone who is dining at &amp;SONS, this is definitely a must have dish on the table. Al dente pasta with the right amount of crab, nduja and sauce. Did I mention the price ? $10 !
Back at on of my favourite lunch spots.. I\'ve got a love hate relationship with this dish.. 4 time having it, love the idea of Guanciale but for some reasons, I\'m not digging the use of bucatini over here.. 
Value for money esp on their lunch menu. It was also super rich in flavour! Not for the faint-hearted. Lol. I wasn\'t able to finish this by myself! It was good but I felt a little \"jelat\" after a couple mouthful. hehe. Probably would prefer their other pasta dishes! :)
At $8-$10 a plate (gst and service charge not included) the food is absolutely amazing. Gets pretty crowded during lunch time but it\'s well worth the wait! Had the homemade tagliatelle bolognese ($9), penne with mascarpone &amp; mushrooms ($8) and roast vegetable salad ($9). Absolutely coming back here again.
Nicely grilled with a sweet sauce, almost like char Siew but super tender. Well worth $16
Simple yet amazing Chef\'s salad I had for lunch today. Set lunch from $8++
Weekday gets even better with divine Italian fare. The lunch special at SONS Bacaro is just what you need. A selection of 16 large Italian plates are available during lunch time and priced reasonably from $8 to $12. 
Many probably would not believe this is actually Italian pasta. Paccheri is a kind of pasta in the shape of large tubes and they are generally smooth in texture. The pasta was cooked al dente which delivered its full flavour and natural texture. The artisanal pasta was served and stuffed with truffle and lberico pulled pork. This is definitely one of the must orders at &amp;SONS. 
I can\'t seem to remember the actual name of this dish but it\'s definitely one of my favs! The balls look burnt but it\'s actually squid ink that gives it that black colour. The shell is crispy and the inside of it is made of crab meat, i think. The cheese next to it just makes this dish delightful. I can never have too much cheese!
The sauce is just amazing. No wonder it\'s their signature dish. The restaurant serves tapas style food so portions are smaller.. 
A medley of asparagus, garlic &amp; anchovy cream that\'s reminiscent of spring in #Italy. Slightly perfumed with smokiness from the charcoal grill, this is extremely moreish.
Tagliolini with shredded crabmeat, nduja, topped with a sprinkling of mozzarella \"snow\" ($10). Perfect for days when all you want is creamy, comfort food.
Don\'t let its intimidating appearance deter you from enjoying what might be the best dish here. These squid ink-crusted baccala (salt cod) cakes had a delicate savouriness; the perfect foil to the creamy, luxurious, and extremely addictive sea urchin sabayon.
Found this by chance and I think its such a hidden gem! Although the grilled chicken doesn\'t taste out of this world, but this dish is pretty neat considering its $8 (before gst). Definitely enough to fill my tummy. The environment itself was one of its kind too, very inviting and cosy. It was full house (indoors and outdoors) during lunch hours and there was a long queue when I was about to go. Their menu is quite extensive I would say, do check them out if you\'re around Chinatown. Lunch menu is only available on weekdays 12-3pm. 
I love sharing plates! Garlic &amp; herb focaccia, grilled vegetable cannolo, cheese and potato ravioli, roasted cod. Great food, wine, and ambience, perfect place to play catch up with friends or relax and watch the day go by
Spaghetti was a bit rubbery. The amount of pasta was way too much and it felt like I was eating a ton of bricks after just a few mouthfuls. Considering the wide variety of other way more interesting choices, do yourself a favour, don\'t order this!
I really like the crisp grilled asparagus tossed with a savoury anchovy sauce and garlic chips dotted with beetroot reduction. 👍\n<br />I\'m making a mental note to whip this up (or a version of it) for Christmas dinner! 🎄
Every dish was amazing! Extensive research by beloved @limmeted, success! #burpple
This was so good I had to have it again.  Paccheri (Large tubular pasta) stuffed with ricotta, pulled Iberico pork and truffle before baking.  Rich, flavorful, smooth.  @trisatay thinks it\'s the best pasta she\'s had to date.
Ambience is lovely on a normal Friday night. No music blasting in your ears yet soothing enough and cozy amidst the lighting. Food is decent in small portions and accompanying drinks are even nicer

Nice / new appetiser - cod cakes. I didn’t hate it.

&amp;SONS has an affordable lunch menu (nothing above $13.90++ if I recall correctly) with good variety. I had the seabass which was panfried to crispy-skin perfection and set atop a bed of purple cabbage. The potatoes were also really yummy. Other offerings on the lunch menu include steak (!!) and pasta.
However I was in for a pleasant surprise! The meat was soft, tender and full of flavour. I was surprised how easily I could cut through the beef with A BUTTER KNIFE! 🍴Can you believe it? That\'s how soft the meat was. I really enjoyed how the mash potatoes on the side complemented the whole dish together with the flavourful brown sauce. The only downside to this dish was me being unable to finish the whole piece of meat on my own. 😅Hahaha! I\'d recommend sharing their main courses as the serving portion is pretty huge, unless well, either you\'ve a huge appetite or you\'re just feeling greedy (like me). 😝
Longing for a decent one soon! Featuring this Baked Eggplant Parmigiana. Delish indeed! 😋
Featuring the Baked Chicken Carcciatorè ($12.90) from SONS (otherwise known as &amp;SONS).
Portion is okay, order this if you like beef
Very small portion for $29 \n<br />Highly not recommended
Thankfully we ordered the salad as the ribs and pasta (especially the pasta) was a little too \'gelat\'. Went for lunch and this meal cost only ~S$44 in total! 😵 *\n<br />*\n<br />Entertainer :1-1 main course\n<br />Lunch menu ranging from $10.90-12.90
Can\'t go wrong with this classic 
The unique taste of cheek got a bit too strong towards the end.\n<br />Used entertainer of course. \n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sgrestaurant #entertainerapp #burpple
The price for one at another popular French restaurant is about half this price and since I used the entertainer, it\'s pretty much a steal. Their ala carte menu was definitely leaps better than the set lunches I had previously.
👍
Delicious and cheap meals should always be shared. Also, according to Google, guanciale is a type of cured meat from the jowl or cheek of a pork. 🙂🙃🙂(7.4/10)
But it\'s anything BUT!!! Baccala cake 🐟with sea urchin sabayon... Good for a starter but satisfies a sweet tooth too! 🍭
Surprisingly tasty 😋\n<br />🦀🍝 #singaporefood #instafood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgfoodlover #instafood_sg #sgigfoodies #foodsg #burpple #foodgram #foodstagram #foodshare #setheats #eatbooksg #dining #sgrestaurant #tagliolini #pasta
This roast cod and their crab tagliolini changed my perception of &amp;sons 🤗
Think carbonara, and sea urchin. Their marriage was an amazingly addictive rich taste that was surprisingly non-jelak at the same time. The crispy fried bacon bits elevated its taste to yet another level. \n<br />Yumz was all I remember after the dish... #burpple  #BurppleSG #sgmakandiary #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #foodgasm #foodieSG #whati8today #instafood_sg #foodsg #nomnomsg #foodpics #foodphotography #foodpornsg #foodforfoodies #foodporn #foodgramsg #urchin #carbonara #pasta
Can always depend on &amp;SONS for high-quality food. 
After trying out &amp;sons twice so far for their lunches I can only say it\'s been rather disappointing. \n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sgrestaurant #&amp;sons #porkmilanese #burpple
Thanks @patricoantonio for introducing me to this monstrosity called guanciale!
Decent - everyone at the table enjoyed it. 
Unfortunately the dish wasn\'t flavourful enough for me (despite the amount of cheese you see on the plate).\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sgrestaurant #pasta #ragu #italian #burpple
Olive oil is splattered through without that cloy feel. A+ ambience for an A+ price. 👌🏻💯 #marshmunch #burpple
But this was simply picture perfect so I had to post! 😛
$10.90 for their weekday lunch special and so filling! They\'re pretty generous with their #cheese too.
💕 #burpple
Top left: Crab and Nduja Tagliolini. Tastes alright but not wow. Also a pity that the crab meat was too finely shredded that I couldn\'t quite taste nor feel it on my tongue.
Super love #BlueCheese. \n<br />#foodie #foodporn
