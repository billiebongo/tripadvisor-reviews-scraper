With a large group of friends, we came here and ordered around 10 dishes. A large variety of Asian-western fusion. The total added up to $350.
Home for the weekend before I\'m off, and there\'s no better way to start the Saturday than with the weekend brunch at Adrift.
Amazing dessert! Fragrant, light, crunchy, little tangy.. My new love for now! :) 
Surprise in the flavours! Try it and let me know if u like it :)
Won me over!\n<br />http://slowchomp.com/restaurant-week-2015-adrift-by-david-myers-marina-bay-sands-mbs/
The dish that Adrift is best known for. Generous crab slivers, crispy bread and gooey cheese. Highly recommend. Mine was slightly burnt, but it was awesome all the same. 
Today\'s burger is sensational. Wagyu Cheeseburger, medium done. So juicy and red inside yet with a nice aromatic char that Maillard Reaction has happened. Burger was served open faced. One side with the hot ingredients - patty with melted cheese. The other side the Ajwain Tomato Relish with loads of finely grated Parmesan.
As exemplified by these sprigs of young kale, there\'s more dewy liveliness to every bite. Not much else went into the salad - just some sliced shimeiji mushroom, shaved truffle pecorino, roasted hazelnuts and a light shallot vinaigrette dressing. But then with such bright and fresh produce, not much is needed. #veronicaphuaeats #adriftbydavidmyers #adriftrestaurant #MBS #celebrityrestaurant #burpple #foodporn #whati8today #eatoutsg #instafoodsg #sgeats #sgfood #sgfoodies #healthylunch #kale #salad #vegetarian #burppletastemaker
Deceivingly basic in appearance, this French Toast was a marvelous manifestation of what happens when you use only the most interesting and well-made components to form the whole.\n<br />The slice of bread was actually an extraordinarily moist caramel brioche that had been grilled to an optimum crunch around its entire surface. It was then covered in icing sugar to look like fresh snowfall. Sitting on top was a scoop of coconut sorbet that resembled a half-built snowman. The taste of it walked the fine line between creamy and icy with finesse. I was wondering how did it not melt upon being placed on the hot surface of the toast. Well, it turns out there\'s a cleverly concealed crisp, caramelised sugar disc that doubled up as a separator and a secret platform for the sorbet. The accompanying \"kopi syrup\", a sensuous concoction of coffee and dark chocolate, was served in a mini jug so I could pour however much I liked.\n<br />When eaten together, all the aforementioned elements played off each other to the best effect. It\'s possibly one of the most intensely flavoured French Toasts I\'ve ever had,

A back-to-nature theme is my guess for the concept behind this aesthetically pleasing rice bowl that fuses fresh ingredients with basic cooking methods.\n<br />The rice which is shaped into a thick patty then toasted, has an addictive smoky aroma and a crisped coating, not unlike that of the fragrant grains found in our local Claypot. Sesame seeds and bits of seaweed are sprinkled generously over the top, elevating its taste factor. The eggplant, baby corn and mushroom placed around the rice have also been grilled. Thus allowing natural sweetness and succulence to be kept intact while infusing them with a subtle smokiness. The crowning touch is the egg, prepared in the classic style that you find in most good ramen. \n
Oh, to be in the spring of life! As exemplified by these sprigs of young kale, there\'s more dewy liveliness to every bite. Not much else went into the salad - just some sliced shimeiji mushroom, shaved truffle pecorino, roasted hazelnuts and a light shallot vinaigrette dressing. But then with such bright and fresh produce, not much is needed. 
It\'s like rich, smooth-talking Mr. Ricotta threw a party and invited the only guests whom really matter - acerbically witty Miss Preserved Lemon and the mysterious Mr. Black Sugar who\'s actually more complex than plain ol\' sweet. To no one\'s surprise, the chemistry between the three of them was out of this world. 
After placing our lunch orders, we were presented with these complimentary sheets of house-made crackers that tasted above and beyond the usual.\n<br />Both the white and black ones were made from ground white rice, with the latter getting some additional charcoal powder action. Brown rice was used for the third cracker, which explained its colour. All of them were completely oil-free, incredibly light and off-the-Richter-Scale crunchy. With the accompanying aioli dip, they were even more fabulous.\n
Twss‚úåüèª tourist shot! Dude was probably here for the opening of Bread Street kitchen
[$14]. I could have a different small plate at Adrift , for dinner all the time. üëå
üç®Indeed, Adrift lives up to its buzz and hype for me -thought provoking , elements of surprise and delight especially in their desserts. I wouldn\'t start on their Raspberry sorbet and creme fraiche here. üòç I totally had a rare, close my eyes kind of moment with the first taste of this Caramel French Toast! üçû I had to think about how smooth this caramel flavoured bread was !it was quite dense for a bread but totally worked - almost forgot it was French toast. We almost forgot to top the coconut sorbet with their intense Kopi syrup ! Extraordinary l . French toast appreciation at David Myer\'s level ! Would love to meet him now.üòÜ‚ú®üòç
We were happy to have discovered this fresh cheese and egg ravioli when we added it back on,Surprising in its presentation as well as taste. Perhaps due to the tiny portion that I had I did miss out on the spiced lamb, Chilli and mint flavors. #pearlspectives
And we also get to try ginseng infused canap√©s by Executive Sous Chef William Gumport.
From the drinking bites menu: yuba with truffle  cheese. Super good!
The green curry ain\'t in paste but innovated into the mayo cream in powder without being spotted at sight. Brilliant work by Chef David Myers. Yum! #adriftbyDavidMyers #mbs #sgfood #celebrityrestaurant
The bf wanted to try new resto so here we are. So far, I\'ve had crab Toastie, it\'s pretty ok. Hamachi had a fishy taste, the ambience is dark and trendy typa place. Good for friends for dinner / pre game. Not really my style though. 
Another straight forward grilled chicken breast, with spring onion on the side. Cooked nicely, not dry at all. But this kind of dish you can always prepare at home, a healthy concious friend ordered this, good for him üòú
Cheft Myer\'s speciaty which is mentioned in most media coverage of the restaurant, King crab melt with pimento cheese, a twist of the American classic, very good, will have it again yes. 
Many of the dishes are simply grilled-fresh-good-quality ingredients, with that smoky flavour from the charcoal. Like this one.. Flavourful! 
The dishes in Adrift are Western food with a touch of Asian influence served tapas style. Good to be shared among friends. Right top corner: grilled crunchy baby potatoes, very good. Right bottom corner: baby okra with chunks of ham with special sauce: i do like okra but that dish lacks of wow factor. Left bottom corner: grill of vegetable assortments; including mustard green which is common in chinese cuisine and normally found in the wet market. With a sprinkle of fried shallots. Excellent dish, simple but yet burst with flavours, that smoky char flavour, recommended! 
I can\'t remember which type they are specifically but was told they\'re air-flown from the US, i assume east coast. They\'re quite smaller normally but flavourful. There is a nice twist on the vinegar with the asian taste, but I don\'t find the oysters as good and as fresh as the one at Luke\'s Oyster Bar
Yeah, when I\'m with you.
I think I\'ve officially fallen in love with this girl.
I can imagine why people would like this place, it\'s very hip, forward and New Yorkish. Something quite lacking in the Singapore market. Service was prompt too.
What we loved: classic cocktails that pair fantastically with their Modern European fare, elevated with a touch of Asian influence. Look forward to ingredients like ginger, kombu and togarashi (Japanese capsicum). The Beef Tartare on Toast, served with seaweed, fresh sesame leaf and hint of chilli, is a definite must-order.
Loved this salmon tartare with Nori chips.
The entire patty is made out of prawns, and large ones too. Quite tasty and excellent value, part of the power lunch set.
Nicely executed first course at Adrift\'s power lunch.
Amazing 3 course menu for $19++, additional drinks pairing $15++ at Adrift restaurant. Menu changes weekly. Amazing staff, amazing meal, amazing friends :) great Friday lunch date x

Some crispy Garlic Chips served as sides.
Attending a special pairing dinner hosted by Chef David Myers in collaboration with @beamsuntorysg tonight. A reminder that drinking SUNTORY out of a tulip glass really makes a helluva difference üç∫üç∫üç∫. This pairs  perfectly with the pungent smelling Truffle Pecorino on baby spinach salad with toasted hazelnuts as morsels of excitement weaved into healthy greens.

Well, you have to order a drink of course. So here\'s our penicillin and Sicilian Nero D\'Avola to celebrate our first year anniversary as well
Unlimited servings of fresh oysters(FAV üòçüòç), langoustine, clams, mussels, sashimi, cured meat, pastries, etc etc...Attentive world-class service, good food and cheerful staff made the dining experience a very pleasant one. And we got to meet and talk with THE man @gypsychef himself!Super worth it!! üòçüòç #EileenWantsToCampHere #Brunch #AdriftByDavidMyers #MarinaBaySands #CelebrityChef #Burpple #Seafood #Sashimi
CARAMEL FRENCH TOAST drizzled in KOPI syrup and paired with SHISO sorbet (which chef was kind enough to swap from coconut sorbet). The sorbet was unique in taste, flavorful and herbal!
CRISPY LAMB CUBES with mint sauce! I swear this is SOO GOOD, it tasted like pork belly or what the Chinese called siok bak. Super crispy exterior with a layer of melt in the mouth fats inside. I wish they had this on the menu üòÜüòª. I could munch on this forever üòÇ .
ADRIFT BENEDICT. Lovely Onsen eggs on grilled rice cake, a twist to the usual muffins, with bacon and miso hollandaise for that extra saltiness and creaminess!

The highlight here was the wagyu hanger steak which @paulo_maldini said was one of the best steaks he has had. I had the barley risotto which was ok-ok. Lol. But the desserts were much too cloying.
Love it with the nam jin dip!
Comfort food at its best :)
(Cute little thing can be eaten)
Very Asia influenced 
With foie gras! 
Watercress, potato bread
