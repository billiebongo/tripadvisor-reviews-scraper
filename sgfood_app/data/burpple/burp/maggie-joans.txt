The \"Waldorf\" is reinterpreted here in the form of compressed apple cubes, walnut (granola?) and an addictive celery emulsion. The harmonious blend of sweet and savoury was a good counterpoint to the alluring smokiness of the tender quail.
It\'s all about that dukkah. The heady Egyptian spice blend of herbs, seeds, nuts &amp; spices elevated the humble egg to ambrosiac cult status; I shamelessly lapped up every bit of the creamy goodness. While I was scouring the plate for remnant traces of dukkah, the waitstaff attempted at clearing the (clearly empty) plate only to have it snatched back by yours truly, followed by an empathetic reply by my dining companion: \"She really loves her dukkah\". Yes, I might be a little crazy when it comes to food.
Fresh, crisp, and light-as-air, these crackling curls of joy did a fast disappearing act from the dinner table. 
Would have preferred a bigger explosion of yolk but loved the dukkah.
It is easy to miss this hidden gem, with its backdoor entrance located in the quiet alley behind Amoy Street. That underground, mysterious vibe is just what the owners, the same people behind Moosehead Kitchen &amp; Bar, were looking for. This unpretentious modern Mediterranean spot instantly puts you at ease with its warm, cosy interior complete with raw brick walls, making it great for date nights or celebrations among small groups. Start with some housemade rosemary bread ($5) ‚Äî it‚Äôs so good you might just forget the accompanying hummus is there. Go for the Dukkah egg ($6) for a quick, oozy bite, and share the Iberico Secreto ($34) for a sublime mouthful of tender pork, tart prunes and pickled cauliflower. You may not want to share the Sea Bass ($28) with marinated cherry tomatoes, and a gentle pesto \"soup\". For dessert, don\'t miss the Goat\'s Cheese Parfait ($10). Pro tip: enter from Gemmil Lane, and turn right when you reach the end. *Menu items will change with seasons.
@maggiejoanssingapore is one of the best things that happened on the SG dining scene this year. Love the fresh and seasonal produce featured in their mod Mediterranean dishes. Www.ms-skinnyfat.com active link in bio!
First and foremost, the sea bass fillet was pan-fried flawlessly. The fish was still moist yet flaked effortlessly, and the skin ‚Äì oh, that glorious skin ‚Äì so shatteringly crisp! üòçüòç\n<br />But what really took this dish to the next level was that ridiculously flavourful pesto sauce. üëÖüí¶üí¶ Don\'t expect the usual consistency and texture though, as it comes in liquid form while still preserving the essences of garlic, basil, toasted pine nuts and Parmesan. So vibrant and umamilicious!
The green liquid is pesto soup that is so so so delicious. It goes so well with the panfried seabass.  You see those cherry tomatoes there? They aren\'t cherry tomatoes off the box. They had their skin removed and 1) yellow tomatoes are pickled with honey and vanilla. 2) red cherry tomatoes are marinated in balsamic, garlic, thyme and olive oil. I got to bring the wife here for this. This will definitely pass her tastebuds. #maggiejoanssingapore
This might look simple, but the taste awesome and the preparation work so tedious. Yellow tail sashimi has been brush with an orange and lemon glaze. To get the glaze they have to burn oranges and lemon in an Inka oven till it‚Äôs black. It is then strained and made into a syrup. To give it some nice acidity to the dish, they have escabeche pickles - the carrots and onions. (Come to think of it, my mummy also makes her pickles to go with her dishes, not called escabeche because it‚Äôs not Mediterranean but Chinese. She pickle her cucumbers, carrots, cabbage or achar. hehe‚Ä¶) Served with some Brandade mousse and finish with some fried sour dough crumb. It‚Äôs so good, the brandade and the hamachi is so good.
This is Roasted Jerusalem artichokes from France. Roasted in a pan slowly until the caramelization occurs. It\'s then topped with manchego cream and some mixed seeds. Jerusalem artichokes have high levels of inulin that is beneficial for your good bacteria in your lower gut. They ward off bad bacteria and lowers hypertension. It also decreases blood cholesterol. The amount of potassium reduces heart diseases. It\'s also high in iron. Ok. Just order it. Food that looks good and taste good and is good for health. üòÇ
Poached egg rolled in dukkah and then deep fried to give it a more firm egg white which is why when you try to break the egg, gently the egg goes back into shape like in the video. üòç #maggiejoanssingapore
It\'s a slow poached egg that has been rolled in dukkah and then deep fried! Then more dukkah over it served with some saffron aioli. For lovers of poach eggs with flowy egg yolk who finds the usual poached egg too mainstream already. Hehe. This is good!
They have no \'front door\' and you enter via the \'back door\' from this back alley! So cool right. The name is also very cool. The name that forms @MaggieJoansSingapore is the name of the owner\'s paternal and maternal grandmama!
That orange cake was da bomb and I don\'t even like orange desserts. And yogurt is a brilliant pairing (finally a chef who does this like I do)! I finished most of the red wine poached figs with house made ricotta as well. Oh my thighs..
The ham component is made of Jamon Ib√©rico Paleta and the light brown sand next to it was Sourdough Crumbs. The scallop was marinated with Sherry vinaigrette and decorated with little dots of pea &amp; mint pur√©e. A lovely combination of flavors, this was one of my favourite dishes this evening. #yummy #sgfood #burpple
Lovely Mediterranean food at Maggie Joan\'s. Loved the sea bass and iberico pork. Soooo good and I\'m soooo stuffed.
Didn‚Äôt even need to lift my knife for this dish, that‚Äôs how tender they cooked this pair of glazed Iberico arm pits.¬† Pits down, favourite main course of the night @oliverhyde, I‚Äôll be ordering this again! (ps. I could still do with more salt ‚ò∫Ô∏è) Grilled Iberico Pork Secreto | Prune Wedges | Cauliflower Puree | Pickled Cauliflower
If you have a soft spot for soft oozey yolks, you‚Äôll enjoy this one. Liquid yolk centre embedded within smoked mash before it‚Äôs encased in their handmade sheet of pasta. Finished with a drizzle of fragrant brown butter sauce.\n<br />Great vegetarian option! @oliverhyde\n<br />Smoked Potato Mash | Egg Ravioli | Spinach | Brown Butter | Crushed Hazelnuts
Quails were tender and juicy with a good amount of smoked retained on them. It just.. needed more salt! \n<br />Smoked Quail | Green Apple Gel | Candied Walnuts | Plump Raisins | Sprigs of Dill
This shot does no justice whatsoever to my expression after taking the first bite. Everything on this plate was executed with extreme precision.¬†\n<br />Marrow, roasted and removed from the bone, tossed with some cured anchovies then spread on a slice of toast of good crumb and crusty edges. Seasoning was spot on! If you don‚Äôt already know, its the hearty stuff that gets me, so I‚Äôll have yours if you don‚Äôt mind.¬†\n<br />Definitely, favourite snack of the night @oliverhyde, IMA SO PROUD OF YOU!
Fried slow-cooked egg (yes, liquid yolk centre and all) crusted in dukkah, and that deep vibrant yellow saffron aioli on the side. 6bucks/serving\n<br />#maggiejoanssingapore

These dehydrated tapioca sago squid ink crackers with the taramasalata dip were a delight, it had every lady at my table, @elainekjl @junkielicious @shannavatsaloo, reaching for seconds and their stamp of approval. Considering, these ladies are experts in making taramasalata themselves, I‚Äôd say fantastic job @oliverhyde.\n<br />Lovely snack for sharing before the meal! (be sure to order double cause I\'m pretty sure these will be gone in a flash)
as part of the sharing set menu, this is the Goats\' Cheese Parfait with Honeycomb and Raspberries. in the background sits refreshingly good Coconut Sorbet on Rockmelon crunchies. yes, i\'m putting up pics of dessert first. remember, priorities üòè

Go ahead have a glass. I won\'t tell... Read more about their exclusive ACME take-over dinner happening this weekend over on the blog. Link in bio
A simple but yet elegant dessert.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #tart #darkchocolate
The freshly made pasta sheet is tossed with chilli paste and paired with 12 hours roasted lamb shoulder. It is then topped with parmigiano reggiano. The highlight has to be the flat and broad pasta sheet which comes with a delightful bite. Not to forget the flavourful and tender lamb ragu which rounded off the whole experience. This is a dish I will definitely go back for.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #maggiejoanssingapore
The Spanish inspired spiced chickpea stew comes with layers of textures and flavours. The more you dig into it, the different play of flavours tend to come through, coming together as one.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #bakedegg #maggiejoanssingapore

It is actually quite fresh to have the combination for a chicken sandwich. The condiments did not steal the limelight of the tender and juicy fried chicken, but instead complement it. The focaccia texture like bread is another excellent choice for the sandwich.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #maggiejoanssingapore #chickensandwich #chickenburger
The risotto ball come with four different types of cheeses. There are gorgonzola, epoisse, langres and ricotta. Cheese lover will adore this. The tomato chutney sitting on the bottom of the plate, provided the extra lift and dimension to the dish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #maggiejoanssingapore #risottoball
The clean and sharp taste of the cured salmon is further topped with dill, pickled cucumber, sourdough crouton and yoghurt. One of my favourite dishes on the new menu, allowing me to enjoy the freshness to the fullest.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #maggiejoanssingapore #salmon
@MaggieJoansSingapore pulls out all the stops to offer something savoury, light yet immensely satisfying at lunch-time
A burger with such much finesse that it has to be called a sandwich
üòç
Little joint specialising in Mediterranean food - for starters, this smoked cauliflower with iberico ham, almond gazpacho and mint ($20) had a nice balance of smokiness and crunch. Nothing is worse than a soggy cauliflower, but this simple and staple veggie was enhanced with unique flavours like the iberico and mintüëåüèª #igsg #sgeats #igeats #sgfood #igfood #tslmakan #burpplesg  #vsco #vscocam #food #mediterranean 
Mmmmmm. \n<br />Thanks @fluffedup for the birthday treat!
The pecorino cheese added a nice touch of umami to the dish. \n<br />Maggi Joan\'s, Amoy Street, Singapore
Its acidity and herbs added a fresh touch that complemented the fish. Nice dinner either wonderful Chef friends.
A classic balance of sweet, savoury and acidity :)\n<br />#fig #redwine #housemade #ricotta #maggiejoans #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple

Seabass, pesto broth and marinated cherry tomatoes, simple ingredients but executed incredibly well and one of the best cooked fish around, perfectly crusted and tender juicy succulence within. The pesto broth is creative and refreshing and surprising. The marinated tomatoes have oodles of umami bomb coaxed out of them. Altogether, inventive, clever, and sublime. Perfect dish :)\n<br />#seabass #pesto #broth #cherrytomatoes #maggiejoans #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodsg #foodporn #burpple

Good looking dish which tastes amazing 
Really good and deserves another visit for a mouthful. Next time I\'ll have it just for myself and no sharing!! Hahaha
The chefs has done a really good job in preparing this.  Yum! \n<br />Maggi Joan\'s, Amoy Street, Singapore
We all left happy and enjoyed the dinner.  The bass was perfectly cooked while the warm pesto was light and flavorful without the \"in your face\" pesto. The dish was accentuated with ripe marinated tomatoes, which gave it a nice and refreshing twist. \n<br />The Iberico pork was fork tender, well seasoned and is melts-in-the-mouth good.  The prunes and cauliflower that accompanied the dish brought it several notches higher and made it a wonderful dish. Kudos to the chefs!! Maggi Joan\'s, Amoy Street, Singapore
This is the Scallop Carpaccio ($21) with pea puree, peas, Paleta Iberica bits, fried sourdough crumbs. Bright, fresh and also a feast for the eyes.
