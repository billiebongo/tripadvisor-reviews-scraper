Something i will definitely be back for. This char siew buns are beyond delicious!
We went a little crazy and ordered quite a lot of food! Lol.. overall experience was good, service was prompt and friendly, and our meal was not too pricey. Enjoyed our dinner.
Because one celebration is not enough ;) We were at Plaza Singapura and made an impromptu decision to try Tim Ho Wan for the first time. We walked to the end of the queue and were ready to brave the not-too-long queue, but were offered immediate seats because there were just two of us! Woohoo! No wait at all, lucky us!
The steamed egg cake is only at average. For its price, you probably could get 3 of them outside. Nothing fascinating about it here. Not worth the money.
as we start to enter de corporate world, these two days have become increasing drugged like.. longing for it to come every time it ends. had a cheena craving de other day, and we ended up havin Tim Ho wan. I like their char siew zhu chang fen. 😛😛
I don\'t usually queue for food. Dine in for the first time cause the queue is short and I waited for less than 5 mins. Love the char siew bao but tiong bahru pau still have the best siew mai!
Crispiest beancurd skin I\'ve came across so far. Prawns are fresh, as for the filling it is stuffed w generous amount of prawn bits. 
The first time I came across pig liver\'s wrapped in vermicelli roll. Such novelty so I decided to give it a try and it was pure genius! My fav among all the items Tim Ho Wan offers. The pig liver\'s go so well w the smooth, thin layer of vermicelli roll and the sauce isn\'t overpowering. 
This bun has got a very special, slightly sweet and cripsy crust. Haven\'t seen and tasted any pork buns like this. It can make you feel full easily because of the generous amount of fillings. I am willing to pay more to have this at Tim Ho Wan. Quality &gt; quantity. 
Rice roll with peanut butter and sweet sauce
Was really worth it! The bun is crispy and it\'s fragrant.
Dim sum restaurant with michelin star... Their baked buns are number 1 (∞˘ڡ˘∞)
We didn\'t have to wait even though there was a queue today! And it tasted alot better than my first visit previously. @gabchua said it\'s cos of his company, hahahah #dinner #onthetable
Just go on a wkday at 9pm. Not that worth queueing..
One of the signature dishes at Tim Ho Wan. This aside, felt that the rest of the dishes are slightly over-rated! 
While everyone was slamming #timhowansg for the lackluster quality, I decided to go with an open heart and mind and found the food decent and above average. Though it pales in comparison to the one I tried in their tiny shop in HK. The husband was less than impressed. I loved the char siew bao so much that I decided to get some to go. To my horror...... - to be continued - #timhowansingapore #timhowan
Osmanthus jelly.. one of the Tim Ho Wan\'s signature, this cold jelly is made from osmanthus syrup with the petals of the flowers as well as goji berries suspended in the jelly. Those who love osmanthus, Must Try! you will definitely love it!
Surprise to see no queue at PS around 5 plus! Even though was not hungry also went in to eat! Lol! 
Finally made it here... after a 45-min wait! 1-macaroon dimsum joint from HK.
Dim sum dinner for the feverish me with @gene_wang &amp; mummy. 😋 [Pork Liver Chee Cheong Fun// Steame Pork Ribs w Black Bean Sauce// Pork Porridge w Century Egg &amp; Salted Egg// Crispy Char Siew Bun// Steamed Mala Cake// Steamed Siew Mai] #fulldieme
Crispy Char Siew Pork Bun. Yum yum yum. Generous wet char siew filling inside the outer crispy bun. I like~ finally something that I\'m able to taste in my mouth.... 😨😷
What must you eat when you\'re at #timhowan? BBQ pork buns, or course! 😊
My favourite-est dim sum dish. Especially good before I go for a marathon lol!! 😜
My favourite!!!! :) now if only THW didn\'t shrink the size of these buns by so much -.- scandalous! | ★★★★☆
Our hungry gang always order 6-8 baskets of chicken feet. Luckily we only ordered 4 this time. It\'s not as flavorful, not marinated long enough. It\'s still nice that we finished them all. So it\'s true lah, they toned the flavors down because many people in Singapore have toned down taste buds. Never mind, I will be in HK to eat their HK version :-)
Total damage: $72.74! Cheaper than expected! Can\'t wait for them to open their new outlet at the upcoming Bedok Mall! :)
Fluffy soft bun, with crisp sugary crust atop the thin shell: the gooey sweet char siew sauce coating the pork morsels are so tasty! Absolutely the STAR of Tim Ho Wan!
Chilled with a refreshing mouthfeel. The wobbly jelly gelled a handful of osmanthus petals and jeweled with a few powerful wolf berries. It liked the texture, not too soft but with some bite in it, the sweetness brings intense joy! Lovely stuff. http://www.epinosh.com/tim-ho-wan-plaza-singapura-singapore/  #timhowan
The innards taste has been overwhelming for me but the rice roll was made thin and soft. http://www.epinosh.com/tim-ho-wan-plaza-singapura-singapore/   #timhowan
This fluffy darlings are so heavenly sweet, perfect indulgence in its intensifying syrupy gooey char siew mopped pork! 3s for $4.50 is worth the wait!
Irresistible polo bun - $4.50/3s. http://www.epinosh.com/tim-ho-wan-plaza-singapura-singapore/  #timhowan
Soft block of carrot-rice milled steamed \"cake\" was dotted in savory Chinese sausage bits that adds fragrance to the plain structure. Lightly pan fried, the charring scorched the exterior haphazardly in a nice smokey scent. Less greasy than most of the carrot cakes I have eaten in Hong Kong. http://www.epinosh.com/tim-ho-wan-plaza-singapura-singapore/  #timhowan
Noticeable mushroom flavor when I took the first bite, the pork paste is bouncy while succulent shrimp bits fills the gap.. the yellow wanton skin was thicker than expected. http://www.epinosh.com/tim-ho-wan-plaza-singapura-singapore/  #timhowan
Moist, pillowy and prominently sweetened with molasses, this block of steamed egg cake swept me off the feet last nite. http://www.epinosh.com/tim-ho-wan-plaza-singapura-singapore/  #timhowan
Smooth and silky, the congee glide from your tongue and down the throat in a breeze. Very tasty without the acquiring century egg note. 
They say it\'s \'life-changing\' : sweet polo bun with delicious char siew inside! Amazing!
Love this interpretation of a pork bun. Crispy on the outside and juicy fillings burst in the mouth. Tip: don\'t be too eager to sink your teeth into it. It is piping HOT! 
45 minute wait for the best 叉烧pau in the world!! I want moreeeeee! 
Only this one nice lahhh.
Old style dimsum traditional steamed cake made from eggs, flour, sugar. Tim Ho Wan version made from brown or palm sugar, i guess. Cotton like steamed cake in fluffy bites and moist enough inside. Sip a cup of chinese tea to complete the perfect taste.
The Michelin Star winning crusty outer buns with cotton texture inside and melted charsiu filling to pleasure your sensation. No wonder they limit items for every customer. Only 1 plate (3 pcs) allowed for your order. 
very delicious which I can\'t forget the taste after my first trial
FINALLY. I didn\'t know what to expect but damn I liked it. Crispy, and the meat was good. Had 3 pieces to go, mum ate it when it was cold and said it was nice. So yupp.
I don\'t like siewmais in general (long story, used to love them as a kid). So imagine the surprise when I actually found this acceptable. Ok I think I liked it.
Doesn\'t quite measure up to HK\'s, but delicious nonetheless!
Recommend the siew mai, ha gow, pay tan choke, cha siew buns. Not worth queueing 4 hours for.
After queuing for about two hours, finally at Tim Ho Wan! #foodporn #food #dimsum
Crispy crust yet soft on the inside with piping hot char siew.
If you ask me if I\'d queue up to eat at this place again, I\'d definitely give a straight no. Not worth the time and effort given the overall mediocre level of dimsum. For one, this bun was quite a disappointment.
so I queued for nearly one hour to try out this highly raved dim sum restaurant  (one Michelin star) from HK. I have to say i really like their Siew Mai!! It\'s tasted so fresh! the BBQ pork was something new am I find it no bad too.. I used to like their carrot cake.. But after I went HK to try their original branch...hands down. HK one is way better lol. Stuff that u may wanna skip: ma Lai go, steam pork rib.
The dough taste so crispy and it makes me feel not bored to chew it. Not to forget the sweet bbq pork in it, super good combination.
big 4 heavenly kings! BBQ pork baked bun, vermicelli roll with pig\'s liver, steamed egg cake, pan fried carrot cake #sgfood
Pork dumplings with shrimp! Love everything that got prawns inside! Hehe 😍😍😍
Spring rolls with egg white! Hehe i love egg related food! :)
Tim ho want four heavenly king- steam egg cake! Really soft and yummy
Rice with sausage,chicken and mushroom! Taste pretty normal and not filling :(
beef balls! #foodporn #timhowan #dimsum okay that\'s enough. imma stop hehhe.
chicken feet! #timhowan #dimsum #foodporn pics are coming in fast cos their service is sooo gooood!
Congratulations to T.H.W on your official opening! But the dim sum fanatics queue is crazy!!!
Fresh from the oven. Check out Tim Ho Wan\'s review, the long queue and 1st customers at DanielFoodDiary.com!
This is arguably the most lauded item at Tim Ho Wan, the much anticipated one Michelin starred dim sum joint from Hong Kong. And understandably so. The uber-light bun with a subtly sweet, crumbly top cradles tender bits of char siew in a more-ish BBQ sauce. So good I can\'t even...........

Would probably get some tomorrow after my dental appointment 🌝 \n<br />Dreaming of those spinach shrimp dumplings 🤤
#shiok\n<br />I think our lunch was pretty light today compared to the usual desserts spam 🌝 \n<br />Resisting the urge to snack on chocolate because I need to leave stomach space for dinner. The struggle 😶
You will regret if you don\'t eat. Hahaha!
Using my capita vouchers before it expires next week. Love the Rice with Chicken, Sausage &amp; Mushroom and the Spicy Prawn Paste Char Siew Stew Noodle so much among the usual dim sum favorites. A great lunch really lifts up one\'s mood.  #timhowansg #timhowan #dimsum #hkdimsum #sgigfoodies #sgfoodies #sgig #igsg #instasg #whati8today #8dayseat #openricesg #burpple #epochtimesfood #mychefstable #iweeklyfood #foodphotography #foodstagram

A truly great round of thanks and appreciation to @robertchua8838 and his lovely wife for hosting us and regaling us with so many delightful stories and anecdotes. \n<br />I am greatly inspired by his passion and his excitement in exploring new food and cuisine concepts to bring to our shores. After tonight, I can\'t wait to see all these ideas coming to fruition and trust me, you won\'t wanna miss a ringside seat to some of these exciting food projects! Stay tuned ;)\n<br />#timhowan #timhowansg #robertchua #sgfood #foodporn #burpple
Definitely has my expectations blown out of the water today \n<br />For the #timhowan fans out there, here\'s me letting you in on a little secret - a NEW and super delicious {Fried Milk} will be gracing the menus on the 1st of May. Stay tuned for more dets
It is deep fried milk which is a delicacy in Hong Kong. This is by far the best version I have tasted. The breaded and toast like crust is a crispy revelation that will send you into an uncontrollable joy with each bite. And the creamy and sweet milky filling is perfect as well, complimenting it every way :)\n<br />#deepfriedmilk #timhowan #timhowansg #sgfood #foodporn #dimsum #burpple
Different restaurants have their different takes on making this. \n<br />My criteria for a good one would be: 1.  Very thin and delicate rice roll, 2.  The filling must be tasty and tender, 3.  The sauce has to be good.  The degree of liking also depends on the nature of the establishments and its pricing.  The one made by Tim Ho Wan is quite good for the price. Since there\'s one nearby, it\'s an easy access when I\'m craving for some.  Best enjoyed with good company. \n<br />Tim Ho Wan, Singapore
I love watching them make it fresh in the flat steamer. #burpple #timhowan #foodporn #dimsum #yumcha

I\'m someone who usually won\'t cringe when I see hair in my food and subscribe to the \"3-second-rule\" (if the ground looks clean enough to me). But this one was something else. It was a long long strand of hair which came frm the thick of the meat filling, sticking all the way out to the crust of the bun. The husband tried pulling it out at first sight, but it actually snapped twice. I had every intention of ingesting this but seeing how stubbornly lodged it is, I decided that it was too much for me to stomach. The information was too much for me to handle - a woman with long, thick black hair was tasked to pack the meat into the bun. I hereby warn everyone to be extra careful with what you put in your mouth. Not just frm #timhowan but as long as you are eating out, inspect your food! #notgoingback #sonotgoingback #definitelynotgoingback #whyqueue? #timhowansg #timhowansingapore
