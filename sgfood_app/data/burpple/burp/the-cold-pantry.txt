üôä Charcoal vanilla icecream w root beer waffles, charcoal lychee and lavendar soft serves üòã Finally got my icecream fix üôÜüèª #burpple
Chocolate Root Beer Waffle with Charcoal Vanilla Ice Cream ($12.50) - Crispy outside and fluffy inside, waffles were pretty good and really chocolatey! Root beer sauce wasn\'t distinct to me and we didn\'t really like the taste of the ice cream though.
The toppings here were pretty simple, old school treats like M&amp;Ms, Kinder Bueno and peanut butter cups, but satisfying nonetheless :)
The waffles here have improved quite a bit! Much better \'eggier\' flavour as compared to the bland one I had a while back. The salted caramel was a bit too salty but the nice burnt flavour was there. Overall quite enjoyed it. Don\'t get the vanilla, it\'s so full of extract you\'ll wonder if you are at a fast food chain. And you\'ll remember how much you paid, then maybe not.
Went and tried the famous black waffle with root beer ice cream, was not disappointed. The chocolate flavored waffle match up nicely with the ice cream. I thought the ice cream will have a strong root beer taste but instead the taste is very subtle, but satisfying. The overall combination is well thought out and the dish is well prepared. The cookie holding the ice cream is a nice touch. We\'ve also ordered a salted caramel waffle with yogurt on top which is appetizing and savory. Definitely recommend this place for any dessert lovers! 
The taste may get some getting used to though.
Charcoal Vanilla Ice-cream. Surprisingly light and smooth, and tastes much better than it looks! Not my typical flavour to choose for an ice-cream but this was very refreshing.
Much raved about, this was rather underwhelming. While I really liked the waffle, the ice cream was nothing special. The waffle was crispy outside, yet had a fluffy cake-like texture inside. Quite dense, and was really rich and chocolatey so that was a plus point. The hint of root beer was really quite distinctive, but I\'m not a fan and it tasted a bit weird to me. The ice cream, while looking seductively black, is just your normal vanilla ice cream that isn\'t too different from other soft-serves out there. I would say that this isn\'t really worth it especially considering the price, and Sunday Folks or Creamier would be a better option. Priced at$12.50
Another sinful gem accomplished! Dense with crispy edges chocolate root beer waffle that sizzle a little fizziness of the root beer. Really delish and unique piece of art. Charcoal vanilla is a little plain jane, but I guess that\'s why it complements well with the more intense flavored waffle! 
.\n<br /> üç¶üç¶üç¶#throwback\n<br />.\n<br />Charcoal vanilla ice cream drizzled with root beer sauce on top root beer waffle ($12.50)\n<br />.\n<br />Love the waffle which is crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. I don\'t fancy the ice cream. It tasted like sweet black vanilla ice cream. Can\'t really taste the root beer sauce either.
The Cha Yen softserve is thai milk tea flavoured and quite flavourful but a little expensive for $6.50 a cup. The Chocolate waffles was nice and tasted like brownie, however the rootbeer softserve didn\'t have a very distinct taste. 
Rootbeer waffle with charcoal vanilla soft ice cream. The waffle is like chocolate cake, so yummmyyyy. Worth to tryüëÖ
Charcoal vanilla soft serve was good; texture was lovely, and sweetness very well balanced between the sweetened and natural vanilla. Root beer sauce gave it that extra kick that made this place worth coming back to. Root beer waffle didn\'t live up to its name though, and turned out slightly burnt. The other soft serve pictured here is Thai Milk Tea, and gosh it was just as good. Give the waffles a miss and order 2 soft serves instead!
They could be more generous with their soft serve and root beer drizzle though, or you\'d just be paying for novelty. \n<br />It made me feel like I can make milo or kopi or grape soda or melon milk or alcoholic waffles... üòè
Chocolate waffle, charcoal vanilla soft serve and root beer sauce. #sgfood #dessertporn #burpple
We order their;\n<br />1. Root Beer Waffle ($12.50)\n<br />2. Cha Yen ($6.50); Thai milk tea ice cream with honeycomb crumbles. \n<br />Verdict: Crisp and fragrant outer crust with moist chocolately brownie like texture. Recommend their Cha Yen too üëçüèª. #cuisineparadiseeatout #thecoldpantry #waffle #burpple
Not overly sweet but perhaps a little more tea flavour will taste better. The combination of handmade honeycomb, nata de coco and rice crisp goes well with the softserve too.
+ Berrylicious yogurt + rainbow pretzels on the side. Waffle was dense, chocolatey and cake-like yay. Ice cream was shiok hehe though more root beer drizzle would be awesome #throwback
Wanted to visit this place for quite a long time and I finally did! Everything tastes so good (maybe partly due to the insane weather) and their service was great too! Some flavours were unavailable when we visited but I must say they do really have unique flavours and I\'ll definitely go back to try themüôå
I actually wanted to try their waffles, but because I got this using the sugar app, they say I can\'t top up to get the chocolate root beer waffle because it is a fixed item. Why so inflexible ah? Anyway their loss, I saved my money. The ice cream was indeed smooth and vanilla-y. But I can\'t help thinking the black droplets rolling off the plastic of the cup looks like black paint..
This is an interesting presentation for waffles and effort made to stand out amongst the other cafes selling the same concept is applaudable. Waffles is nicely chewy with a tinge of crispness... who could have imagine chocolate goes so well with rootbeer! And the ice-cream doesn\'t melt easily - not sure if it\'s my imagination but the coldness lingers in throat all the way to my stomach. A great snack on a hot afternoon!
This waffle\'s texture was denser, cake-like and chewy, different from the buttermilk waffle\'s texture. I guess mine was a little overcooked thus it was a little too dry but it was quite good overall. And I got an extra serving of Charcoal Vanilla Soft Serve through @Sugar_Singapore Mobile App. \n<br />Download SUGAR Mobile App to discover more interesting places (F&amp;B, lifestyles, events) in Singapore with a sweet incentive. #wewantsugar
The staff was quick to offer a disclaimer when we placed our order for this: The waffle is made with chocolate, so it will be more cake-like and not so much like your conventional waffle; it won\'t be so crispy ‚Äì is that ok?
Was so looking forward to this! Looked amazing on Instagram. This place is nondescript and pretty hard to find; look for the green tent next to Jewel Caf√© on Rangoon Road. It was long and narrow with limited seating. Waffle arrived and I was like WHAT IS THIS because the soft serve was slanted and I was like oh gosh gimme my money back I paid to get an Instagram perfect waffle haha. Okay jokes aside, I enjoyed the chocolate waffle, it tasted like a brownie. The root beer sauce was tasteless though, and while the vanilla ice cream was, well, vanilla ice cream, after a while it did feel like we were eating tar because of the thick grey colour. All in all another ordinary waffle place, not worth the novelty.
Root beer waffles with soft serve charcoal ice cream. Pretty good tasting waffle and ice cream but the cookie (Chipmore) seems redundant and taste awful. Priced at $13.50.
One of the star desserts at The Cold Pantry - Chocolate Root Beer Waffle served with Charcoal Vanilla ice cream, which tasted more like chocolate ice cream to me and lightly drizzled with homemade root beer sauce.
üòåüëåüèª\n<br />I blame the hot weather for my constant craving for waffles w ice cream lately!üôàüôä
I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted like chocolate chip cookies. It felt like they managed to turn chips ahoy cookies into waffles. Yay for cookie waffles. \n<br />The soft serve was subtle and played a great supporting role to the chocolate waffle. \n<br />Monster wants a Cookie! \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
The Thai milk tea flavour soft serve ice cream is really good, strong taste and good consistency - almost as creamy as ice cream. However, the waffle is a huge let down. It was painfully plain, and I could almost taste the milk and the vegetable oil. With that said, I do think that it was a well made waffle, if only a little too spongey inside. One thing that puts me off was the price, $8 for a subpar waffle? Nah.
- The Cold Pantry\'s famous thai milk tea soft serve with crunchy sweet honey comb and rice krispy and coco jelly!
[Movie Date S$5.90] - laid with nacho chips &amp; cheese, then topped with froyo and popcorns.
Cakey n chocolatey waffle with soft texture while the charcoal vanilla ice cream goes well with the root beer sauce and the waffle.  What a creative combination and an impressive dessert!!
By itself, the soft serve ($6.50) was pretty good. Had the Thai Milk Tea last time round but it\'s no longer available if you go now :( However, they do have a new flavour - lavender. Gosh, and their waffles look pretty neat too.
The Cold Pantry revamped its menu to include a new series of waffles and soft serve apart from their basic offering of Froyo. Besides the classic batter, they do have Cookies and Cream batter where there are Oreo cookie bits inserted into the crisp and light batter which is fluffy. Cookies &amp; Cream Milk Chocolate chunks are scattered across to incorporate the Cookies &amp; Cream flavour. Charcoal Vanilla soft-serve was somewhat more milky instead rather than its intended flavour, and Speculoos crumbs are sprinkled to infuse cookie flavours into the soft serve. Chocolate Chip cookie is used as a base to hold up the soft-serve. Overall decent, but at $14.50 it seemed a tad pricey for waffles IMO.

Instead of trying their signature black-faced waffles icecream, we decided to go for what we love - original waffles + cha yen soft serve with honeycomb and nata de coco üòã #latergram #burpple #instadessert #ekeats #ekahmakan
Essentially kaya toast that has been waffle-lized. The matcha soft serve was milky with a tinge of bitterness, the fragrant and sweet coconut slime coats both the exterior crevices and inner linings of the waffle, whilst the waffle itself was crispy and slightly bready. 3.9/5
Loving the texture of the waffle and the taste of the root beer ice cream is SCREAM~~~ nice
Sawadeekrup! I feel like I was being brought back to Bangkok after trying the Cha Yen Soft Serve ($6.50) from The Cold Pantry. The distinctive taste of the Thai milk tea in ice cream form with handmade honeycomb crumbles, nata de coco and rice crispy just makes eating ice cream an every-occasion affair. How about some Cha Yen Soft Serve after dinner today? 
Loved the combination of strawberries, homemade yuzu white chocolate and rice crisp over the soft serve! 
Waffles were soft and crispy, very much to my liking. However the combination of vanilla and cookies and cream made the whole desert a little too sweet. Do ask the staff for recommendations on the different combinations! 
The base yogurt was really good, however the milo powder that was sprinkled on it did not compliment well...
Price: $14+ , good service, small spaced but cosy. Good lighting for photos if your a avid food photographer. The ice cream is smooth and milky yet in a unique dark grey colour.
Can\'t really taste much of the rootbeer but overall taste was okay. üòã
The matcha soft serve was milky with a tinge of bitterness, the chocolate cookie serves as a competent partition and the waffle delivers what is promised on the label, albeit being faintly reminiscent of waffles of the neighbourhood variety. Compared to its thicker and fluffier brother, this slender, Topman slim-fit jeans-wearing waffle may prove to be another case study cited by the ‚Äúsize matters‚Äù camp proving the same. (I must disclaim that given the Secret Life of Fatbacks website tagline is ‚ÄúThe Fatter, the Better‚Äù, I have an inherent bias.) 3.5/5
Wanted to try the sea salt caramel waffle paired with the Thai milk tea soft serve but the waffle wasn\'t available... so we went with the staff\'s recommendation instead. The chocolate waffle had a crumbly, almost cake-like consistency with minimal root beer flavour infused in the batter. Though the charcoal vanilla soft serve paired flawlessly with this waffle, I enjoyed the Thai milk tea (separately) more. 
Give me some root beer, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug.
Finally I tried this Chocolate Root Beer Waffle with Charcoal Vanilla Soft Serve! The soft serve so good that I had 3 different ones in a day!! üòãüòã
Located next to Jewel Cafe + Bar on Rangoon Road, yogurt joint The Cold Pantry has recently revamped their menu. They now offer both yogurt and soft serve options, as well as a variety of quirky flavoured speciality waffles. If you\'re in the mood for something savoury, go for the mildly spicy Mexican Nachos or the chicken Bak Kua Meltz waffles (both $10). For those with a sweet tooth, go for the Kaya Toast or Sea-salt Caramel waffles (both $8), or go big with the signature Chocolate Root Beer waffle with charcoal vanilla ice cream and drizzled with homemade root beer sauce ($12.50) ‚Äî it\'s a sinful treat you won\'t regret having!
The rather black-faced vanilla ice cream ‚Äî perhaps so coloured after experiencing wretched and tragic betrayal in a Wuxia (Ê≠¶‰æ†) novel ‚Äî was restrained in its milkiness and sat with aloof poise atop the warm and chocolate cake-y waffle (with a chocolate chip cookie at the base protecting her modesty), whilst the strong scent of root beer lingers tantalizingly in the air. 4/5 
A killer combination that ought to work? Perhaps if the waffle was adjusted for more moisture, along with a stronger infusion of root beer
Refreshing treat! Really liked the combination of toppings like the honeycomb bits
The sour yogurt is a mere canvas on which the age-old flirtatious tension between apple and oat play out. Damn, those two should seriously get a room - the romantic chemistry between the two makes for a marvelously sweet, crunchy and refreshing treat. 4.25/5
I think it\'s was not bad! The spoons are really cute though üòõ . It\'s actually beside jewel bar and cafe so it\'s quite easy to find! Hehe love my white background
This was also pretty good. Thai milk tea froyo, studded with handmade honeycomb, honey oats (i crunched on some fragrantly toasted sunflower seeds) and Nata de Coco. I\'ll be going back.
We chanced upon this new froyo shop situated right next to Jewel, where we went to for a quick hot coffee fix on a chilly, rainy day - and were well-rewarded. The froyo here balances sweetness and tartness (something i look out for in froyo), and is generously accompanied by an assortment of exciting toppings. This particular one consisted of original flavoured froyo, apple jelly and buried under were digestive crumbs and cinnamon apple chunks - i absolutely loved this. Fall flavours are my jam.
Berry-licious - lesser toppings as compared to other flavours with blueberries, strawberries and homemade honeycomb. A pretty common selection of toppings that you can find in llaollao too.
New flavour spotted at the Cold Pantry on my 3rd visit - Golden Apple: yogurt with cinnamon apple, apple jelly, honey oats and digestive crumbs. The Apple jelly were pretty much tasteless even though we confirmed with the staff that they actually used pure apple juice to make it. They will probably need to put in more effort for that. The cinnamon apple added indeed spice up the entire froyo, making the tast more unique.
Topped with chocolate chips, oreo chunks and mashmallow and drizzled with chocolate syrup,  this will be the top choice for people who favours sweet desserts. The sweetness will pretty much replace the sour taste of the froyo so go for it if you have a sweet tooth
Taking over Liberty Coffee\'s old space at Rangoon Road is new frozen yoghurt bar, The Cold Pantry. With a handful of froyo stores setting up shop lately, this place sets itself apart by offering not just unique flavours of froyo, but with unique topping combinations as well. Case in point - their thai milk tea froyo with homemade honeycomb, and their Movie-Date yoghurt cup which comes topped with popcorn, banana and chocolate sauce, with a cheese nacho base. How\'s that for unique!
It is Thai milk tea, stripped of its usually over-sugared personality and feeling a bit sour that day. The honey oats and honeycomb added sweetness and texture, but the nata de coco fit in the clique like \"Anaconda\" fits in a love songs mixtape. 4.25/5
I have a \'movie date\' with my yogurt. Pretty interesting combo. 
This place has your normal serving of yogurt cup, a special yogurt cup (Thai Milk Tea yogurt with honeycomb and Nata De Coco) and 3 varieties of yogurt cup with toppings: Movie Date that has nacho chips, cheese, bananas and popcorns, Berry-licious with strawberry, honey oats, blueberry and honeycomb, and the Dark Desire ($5.90), that is suited for chocolate lovers, has Oreo chunks, chocolate pound cake, chocolate bites and marshmallows. 
This cute little cafe still smells new. Just had to try the thai iced tea froyo when I saw it. Sure loved the unique taste! It had the tangy taste of froyo with a slight sweetness of thai iced tea. Yum! Love the crunch on top and the cornflakes inside!
That zesty tang of the lemon went really well with the light cheesecake so it\'s quite easy for one to finish the cake alone, but the crumble base was way too crumbly although delicious as it turned into tiny bits that were almost impossible to pick up when I tried cutting it with the fork.
It\'s always things like these that gets my curiosity; The Cold Pantry pairs up unconventional toppings with their Froyo such as this one, where you can find cheese, nacho chips, chocolate sauce, popcorn and banana in your glass of yogurt. While the combination of the Froyo and Popcorn was really interesting, the Nacho Chips were a bit too daring with its savoury-cum-sour combination with the Froyo. Banana and Chocolate is that classic combination that does not go wrong. Overall it\'s a pretty decent and creative offering which is worth a try.
Calling all froyo fans out there, you will be surprised to discover \"Little Bangkok\" in Singapore. This is Thai Milk Tea Frozen Yogurt, made with low fat milk and stuffed cornflakes, nata de coco and honey crunch which is somewhat similar to honeycomb. 
Seasonal special - Thai Milk tea froyo ($5.90) \n<br />A new addition to the Ragoon aroad cafe family that replaces Liberty Coffee that was located there, this one week old froyo place has joined the cafe industry. First taste of the froyo is what all froyo taste like with a smooth and milky texture. However the milk tea scent is vaguely noticeable. Topped with homemade honeycomb with sesame, it provides a light tinge of sweetness that balances off the strong yogurt taste. As we dig deeper into the cup, we will find coconut jelly that is of the right texture and not too sweet in taste. Mix everything well and the taste is well balanced. Would hope to have a stronger milk tea taste.
Movie Date, a savoury froyo offered here leaves me with a deeper impression as most froyo will taste sour or sweet with toppings. This one leaves me with some salty taste that is rarely found in desserts. Topped with drizzled chocolate sauce popcorn and banana, with a base stacked with nachos chips and cheese, you will experience light sweetness at the top popcorn and banana layer, yogurty middle layer and cheesy and salty base. Surprisingly, a good miz of everything actually makes this taste memorable.

Not as overwhelmingly sweet as the normal Thai ice tea of restaurants, its great for a hot day!

It helps that the staff will explain upon ordering that the texture of the waffle is more towards chocolate cakey and not our usual crispy chewy waffle. It prepares us of what to expect.
Served with spinach, bits of strawberries and tomatoes. \n<br />Valrhona dark cocoa in a bottle is what got me here in the first place. Not too thick and it\'s quite smooth.
Super yummy in this case. \n<br />#beatricewandertales #thefeedfeed¬† #vscofood #thecoldpantry #burpple #openricesg #f52grams\n<br />#onthetable #hungrygowhere¬†#foodstagram #eatoutsg #foodporn #foodie #foodgasm #tagsforlikes #singapore #igsg #sgig #foodpics #foodphotography
Thought the root beer flavour in the waffle was a little subtle as it got overpowered by the chocolate flavour. Nevertheless the waffle was crispy and really tasty! Loved that a #cookie was placed below the #icecream to keep it from getting soggy too! Though I kinda wished the cookie was the \"soft and chewy\" type. Hahaha. #askingfortoomuch Shall be coming back for more! \n<br />#foodie #foodporn #foodpic #waffles #waffleporn #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgcafe #burpple #foodphotography
