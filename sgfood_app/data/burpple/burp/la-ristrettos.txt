baked beans with pesto dressing and duck breast were totally spot on for me but toast (tad tough), poached eggs (tad overdone) and sausages failed to impress. but then, maybe i am being picky. totally heart the cafe vibe here though. defo warrant another visit.
coz monday need coffee. blessed are the folks at novena medical centre. such a good boost to kickstart the day - strong, robust and most importantly, the cafe makes you forget about work!
Ordered a Flat White ($5) and it had a slight acidity in the flavour profile but at the same time, manages to perk me up from my lack of sleep.
Smooth and strong latte that justifies their investment in this beautiful espresso machines
Artistically decorated plate, insta-worthy food ;) Found the poached eggs to be wonderfully done; oozing golden goodness when gently manipulated. Green sauce tasted wonderfully refreshing (lime, yogurt and honey) and gave a tang to this otherwise common brunch dish in many cafes. Sadly, I felt that the English muffin was soggy in the centre and seemed stale and not fresh as I would have hoped it would be. 
Large folded crepe with banana nuggets within each layer, along with a scoop of sweet creamy vanilla gelato and salted caramel sauce. The conventional salted caramel, banana and vanilla combination worked well. Also, the slightly charred ends of the perfectly cooked crepe was commendable, making it altogether a pleasantly sweet treat. \n<br />This is solely based on my \"food instincts\", but (because of how the crepe batter tasted) I thought a savory rendition of the crepes at la ristretto would work better! Which they do serve, hence the need for a next visit. 
This cornmeal cake was soft and moist with a slight char on the edges, and has a grainy texture when you eat it. It‚Äôs seasoned lightly with a mild corn taste, so the full flavour comes from the smoked duck breast and bacon bits, with some capsicum and mustard seed dressing for a wee bit of heat. It was a little hard to cut through the duck though, so while the chunk of meat looked enticing at first, it might have been better if someone else did the work for me *twiddle thumbs* A good light meal option nonetheless.
Sweetened, ice-blended espresso. Definitely a strong cuppa that is lightly sweetened so it\'s a pleasant treat if you are looking for something different from your usual cup of coffee to shake things up a little.
Located on the eighth floor of Novena Medical Centre, this (very) hidden gem serves super tasty AND affordable mains. Come before the lunch rush to snag one of the tables indoors for the airconditioning and buzzy vibes, or if you\'re in a larger group, it\'s a lot more spacious outside among the greenery and under large umbrellas. From the all day breakfast menu, we loved the interestingly layered Breakfast Crab Cake ($15) and were blown away by the Smoked Duck Breast ($14) ‚Äî the duck was tender and perfectly smoked, the bed of polenta was creamy and the poached eggs spot on. When we visited, the Buttermilk Pancakes Ultimate ($13) on the specials board was also a favourite at the table. Imagine a stacked tower of thin but fluffy pancakes topped with creamy scrambled eggs, two strips of pancetta and two banana halves drizzled in salted caramel. Caramelising the bananas would have brought it from good to great. Get the Spiced Apple Cake ($8) for dessert. While certainly not a cake in any way, the crisp puff pastry concealed cinnamon-kissed apples that went so well with the accompanying scoop of vanilla ice cream. Wash it all down with their excellent coffee ‚Äî try the Latte ($5.50).\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler I makan SG
I was surprised at the small space and limited indoor seating. The layout is either communal or individual window seating. There is outdoor seating as well. The place was kind of warm. I ordered a Spiced Apple Cake ($8) and Latte ($5.50 nett). The apple cake is actually an apple cinnamon pastry with crispy pastry on top and chunky, softened apples underneath. The cinnamon taste was not overpowering unlike typical cinnamon pastries. The latte is slightly more expensive than other places but it was also stronger. The communal seating is great for connecting with people and making new friends. 
Despite looking like Goodyfeed or porno website pop-up clickbait (\"20 Types of Photos Your Caf√©hopping Girlfriend Takes Which Proves She Is A ______\" etc), the big breakfast - which certainly lives up to its name - was grandly satisfying and value-for-money. The chewy bacon and naughty meatroll discharged their caf√© duties with professional aplomb, whilst elsewhere the stewed beans had the comforting international appeal of an SIA Leading Stewardess. 4/5
Essentially the happy McDonald\'s hotcakes you had as a kid but now all grown up, with luscious chestnut locks and donning a sleek caf√© apron. The salted caramel sauce would probably make you reminisce for plastic-boxed butter and maple syrup, though. 3.8/5
Crispy patty packed with lots of crabmeat, complemented with avocado, crispy bacon, potato patty and flavoured with balsamic and my favourite pesto. #burpple
Located on the eighth floor of Novena Medical Centre, this hidden gem serves brunch fare at VERY affordable prices (all day breakfast grub start at $13)!! Highly recommend sharing this Spiced Apple Cake with friends after digging into their mains!üç¥
While certainly not a cake in any way, this crisp puff pastry concealed cinnamon-y apple-y goodness that went so well with that scoop of vanilla ice cream. A nice hot/cold way to end the meal, it reminded me of Christmas. 
Was expecting a thick slice of chunky cake, but this was more of an uninverted tarte tatin served in a skillet. Underneath the crisp, flaky, and golden brown puff pastry layer, you‚Äôll discover sweet and spice-kissed apple cubes and raisins. Take a bit of the vanilla ice cream with everything else, and it‚Äôs exactly like Christmas in a spoon! Don\'t forget to get an excellent cup of their Flat White ($5) to go with this. 
Was about to order the Grilled Mixed Seafood Salad (I swear!) but saw this on the blackboard menu below the cashier counter and it was calling out to me. üòÖ
Liquid breakfast to kick off a busy day. Milk was over steamed though, watery and tasteless. Seems like the coffee here is hardly consistent anymore. 
Just the right place with right dose of caffeine to calm my nerves.. 
This cafe has no WiFi, so it\'s more suitable for writing &amp; creative tasks. Plus it\'s a great escape from constant notification distractions whilst working. But honestly if it had WiFi I would visit more often.\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />#LaRistrettos #WorkHardAnywhere
Happy weekend all!\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />#LaRistrettos #Coffee
Smoked duck with poached egg. An interesting variation to an all-time favorite eggs dish for $14! The duck meat was tender &amp; succulent, and the egg was poached to perfection!
A hidden finds in this past of town serves a hearty portion and good coffee at a reasonable price 
As you can see, there\'s a lot of extra ingredients as opposed to normal carbonara. üòÑ
La Ristrettos is a specialty coffee boutique tucked away on the 8th floor of Novena Medical Centre. You would not stumble upon this place unless you\'ve heard about this place from friends and family or if you had to visit a surgeon. (I hope it\'s the former!) It\'s a pretty quaint cafe with a decent food, dessert and beverage menu for its size.
üç¥Crab cake with potato mash, poached egg and avocado $15 
Scrambled egg done nicely with croissant and rocket. Could have done without the cheese which made this a bit heavy for my liking. That\'s just me though.
I think this dish was just screaming at me... Crab cakes for breakfast and at $15, how awesome! The crab cakes were yummy but it had too much pepper in it which I wasn\'t too big a fan of, not sure if it was intentional or an oopsy. Eggs were done correctly with a oozy runny inny, potato cake was potato cake... But the pesto that circled the plate on the side? Made me want to lick the plate or just order a side of pesto.. Really good! Overall a very good meal!
I had an enormous craving for @LaRistrettos coffee when I was hospitalized last month at @mountelizabethsg Novena, but I know it was a no-no, given that I was ill. It was indeed a \'So Near Yet So Far\' situation since it was just a few minutes\' walk away. üò© So I\'m glad to be here today, after sending in some samples to the hospital lab. üòäüíï
Finally found some time to visit somewhere that\'s been around for a while yet I hadn\'t visited. Love their Flat White here; nutty with a medium body and creamy. 
Really needing a cuppa on a sleepy Christmas Eve workday.  Impressive latte art by @timmehchew at La Ristrettos
As much as I like this little cafe, the muesli was dry and sad and I had to ask for extra milk to make it edible.
Smoked chicken breast was so good, tender and really succulent. Heavenly when paired with the sweet beetroot sauce and egg yolk! Didn\'t like the poached egg though, egg white was a bit too curdled for my liking. 
Had a thing for Italian hot choc since I had one in Melbourne.  It\'s like drinking hot fudge! ^^ I\'m unable to capture how thick and viscous it is, but the consistency is not bad! Although it could be a little more chocolatey than milky..
Found myself revisiting this gem a little too soon. Wanted to try their Bircher muesli with poached pear but they were sold out (!!!) so I coincidentally tried another crab dish; crab cake tart. It came with a beautiful runny poached egg, pan fried bacon on spinach atop a heavily buttered bread. The crab cake was a little oily but overall experience still wasn\'t too bad, would be better if they used hash browns or English muffin or brioche as the base instead of white bread. Hmmm. As usual latte for my meal hehe. Superb coffee. 
Crab meat angel hair pasta - it may not taste out of the world but for 14.9 you get real crab meat (and occasionally biting into tiny crab shells - don\'t be mistaken, I\'m not complaining because I don\'t have to dirty my hands at all üòåüòå). Flavored with parsley, tomato and bell peppers, I feel healthy eating this! Unlike usual affogato ($7), theirs came with raisins and nuts, adding textures to the otherwise boring espresso with ice cream! 
$5.50 for a cuppa pretty latte. Love the rich nutty blend that they use here!
Priced at $8, this was so good! Portion was bigger than what I imagined for a tart, which was a pleasant surprise. Such a joy to hear the crackling sound as I sliced through the crisp, buttery pastry crust. Ice cream was creamy and thick. Love it!
I love their coffees but their chai tea latte really cannot make it.. It tasted more like milk than anything. I came home, added more spices, more tea and iced it. I think I just paid $6 for steamed milk?
They do a double shot (I\'m guessing ristretto shots...üòù). So if you don\'t want the extra buzz, ask for singles.
Nice place, a little hard to locate but it\'s a hidden gem. More outdoor seats, but seats facing the sun and really nice tables, communal seating indoors too. Hidden gem :) 
La Ristretto\'s latte have always been a favourite of my mum. Who enjoys kopi-o mostly and thinks Starbucks cold coffee is a nightmare for coffeeple. But she can never say no to La Ristrettos\' latte. Sorry mummzy, I spent a lot on books again but it\'s okay come don\'t angry I buy you coffee.
So let\'s say yay to tax free cafe! Located at novena medical center, 8th floor. It\'s a hidden cafe that not many would notice for sure. The cafe is divided into indoor and outdoor, welcoming you is a shop full of coffee beans. Ordered their scallop spaghetti. The portion is just nice. Something I like about the tomato based is that it doesn\'t taste watery and full of tomato smell. The sauce was thick and there something else in the sauce that make it pretty unique. You can still taste the sweetness in the scallop which I really like it because it\'s hard to keep the sweetness of a scallop majority of the time. I had their latte as well, it was pretty good. One of the better coffee that I tried, the fragrance of the coffee immediately filled up my mouth. It was indeed a hidden gem within novena 
Really lovely, generous with the scrambled eggs, which had hints of buttery goodness. Smoked salmon is delicious mmm! All these, topped with honey yogurt and just, YES. Its a one-hit KO combo. 
Pretty good for $11. Except my poached egg was overlooked! Coffee was good though. 
Best Companions in any Cafe at any hour. Loving the Saturday so far(:
Big Breakfasts are a dime and dozen, so a little effort is always appreciated. At La Ristrettos, their \"Grande Breakfast\" which includes two eggs done your way, has extra touches like the special baked beans that\'s deliciously complex, and plump grilled mushrooms. Pretty worth it for just $14 if you ask me.
Although I found this quite tasty, at the end of the day, the Florentine Croissant is simply a glorified Burger King Croissanwich. It was suppose to have spinach but the cafe had unfortunately, run out. I\'d rather order something else when I return here.
Mornings are made of this. A latte so beautifully bold it buzzed me wide awake from my sleepwalking state. Tracking down this tiny cafe is a bit of a trek but that\'s precisely why it is a perfect escape.
Yummy chicken and spinach on toast! 
La Ristrettos is and will always be a favourite little nook of mine. Decided on a whim to try the special breakfast set of crabcakes ($14) instead of the usual tostino (!!!) and it is a winner. English muffins, sunny side, cherry tomatoes, avocados, spinach, the crab cake itself and a side of sweet potato chips. I\'m not an expert on crabcakes, but I felt this one deserves a mention, as well as to be eaten. Crab filling a\'plenty and a peppery aftertaste makes it extremely yummy. 
Finally had the chance to visit La Ristrettos which only opens in the day. Great hideout, and surprisingly has people working on their laptops and doing some quiet reading here.
Thin slices of pears on crispy pastry plus a scoop of smooth vanilla gelato. It really changes my mind about desserts that are neither chocolate nor strawberry. Heavenly!
Savory-sweet, distinctive, intense dark chocolate. Sweetly tart acidity; light syrupy mouthfeel with a long, resonant finish. 
Very good food; ambience and brilliant coffee. Definitely visiting again! Price are totally worth the quality!
Mushrooms, tomatoes &amp; ham jam-packed in a pan. 
Love the mustard sauce drizzled on the plate. Was so tasty that I couldn\'t stop eating! 
Hidden among the many clinics n offices in Novena Medical Centre, who would imagine there would be such a cool cafe.
Ambience was good but food wise was normal :( but nonetheless awesome catchup!
Achieves a fine balance of chocolate toned coffee notes that is original and deepens in a finish which balances sweetness with a pleasantly drying hint. 
not the best ive tasted. not the worst either but if you ask me  i wouldnt recommend ordering this.
soso i guess .. not that fantastic.. ambience makes up for de food though
you wont know it exists unless you\'re told. hearty breakfast on this fine boxing morning.
Although it wasn\'t kept cold long enough. I must say it\'s always refreshing to have a cold coffee on a hot day.
This spiced apple cake is just as delicious with coffee in the morning as for dessert. It\'s rich, buttery, lightly spicy and very fruity with apple bits and raisins inside. You have to eat it quickly as the ice cream would melt on the hot pan. It\'s the perfect holiday dessert as Christmas is coming!
My spiced apple carrot with vanilla ice cream and half drank coffee.
I need a proper lunch after a stressful 3-hour Monday meeting.
Quite a breakfast for a girl but really nice! Love the egg and the cheese:)
Another first-time visit. Wish I could say better about their service had they not forgotten my order.
My grande sunny side up and her tostino e arrosto. Happy Saturday Brunch with love!
Thick velvety italian chocolate cascading down your tongue it\'s best to try it out yourself with quality service
Nots bad quite accurate. cept that the eggs weren\'t creamy hmmm #burpple #picstitch #inthenameofresearch
Great coffee with pretty latte art. I like their concept of having the espresso machine outside where you will be able to see the barista works his magic
Hidden gem at Novena Medical Centre level 8. A nice and relaxing place to have coffee/brunch, I really love the ambience there :)
Hot Mocha that tasted pretty good with a beautiful art on it :)
Located in the most obscure place ever, La Ristrettos can be found within the maze of private clinics at Novena Medical Centre. You are in for a treat, with one of the best coffees, and latte art around. The kick - the mobile reception here is really poor (hey, it\'s a good thing sometimes!). Rest assured, no one can disturb your escapism.
To all my fellow coffee drinkers IG pals. Enjoy this rare latte pic of mine :) I recalled my kopi pals mentioning this small cafe at the novena medical block and since I had time to spare before going for a free movie preview last evening, I popped by this place to just rest my feet and have a cuppa. I asked for single shot latte as I was told that all their coffees are two shots. I don\'t take to coffee very well which is why u hardly find coffee shots on my feed üòâüòä

My go to cafe where I can indulge. I always order the pear tart with caramelized pear. Thin pastry covered with thin sliced pear. It is served warm just out from the oven. Eat it in a jiffy as the residual heat melts the vanilla ice cream quite fast.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Today\'s wait was longer than usual, almost 30 mins. I wolfed it up in 10 as I was already behind my schedule.
Looked like an angry burger with the knife stuck in. Meat patty so thick and juicy. The yolk so yellow so runny. Sweet potato fries.. hmmm.. who can resist. Wont you like to sink your teeth into this?
Each time I come by here, I always order this if it is available.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Sliced pears so tender and sweet. Tart base crisp at the edges. A dessert that is easy to indulge even when tummy is full. I walloped this in just 5 minutes after a waiting time of 15. Pair it with coffee (good coffee here too) for a bittersweet ending.
Good opportunity for a relaxing lunch before the reunion dinner. Back at my favourite cafe for my Crabcake Breakfast. Crispy crabcake complemented by caramelised bacon, mashed potato, avocado with rockets in pesto and balsamic sauce. My kind of flavours. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved #crabcake
The ice cream melted fast thus making everything soggy though~ but it is still nice!
Satisfying~
Fell in love with this Spiced Apple Cake with a scoop of ice cream on top. For just $8, this is surely very worthy of your money, as well as not-wallet-burning !! Do check out this place, it is a true gem hidden in the maze of Novena Medical Centre.

Excuse me while I sip in peace and quiet.
The dish was wonderfully balanced with lightly poached salmon, creamy feta cheese, grilled cherry tomatoes for the slight acidity and lots of quinoa for the texture. Drizzled with olive oil and lemon, everything came together well with the kale as my star for the dish. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #cafesg #breakfast #soba #sgcafehopping #kale #salmon #breakfast
Another healthy dish good for brunch here while enjoying the slower pace of life by the counter seat (waiting for pokemons). Light in taste with the sweetness of the pumpkin. It was a big slab of the tuna, only if it was cooked a little shorter cos the meat tasted a tad too hard. \n<br />Nonetheless, this place remains one of our favourites for a good weekend brunch. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #cafesg #breakfast #soba #sgcafehopping #tuna

Blood test). üíâüòú Nurse advised me to look away while getting my blood drawn, but I simply looked. It ain\'t scary at all!
Where\'s everyone heading for coffee this weekend?
Brek for two at $32
Mildly spicy crab cake on top of a piece of bacon and focaccia bread. Nothing to rave about, but it looks so pretty! There are pieces of crab meat inside the crab cake but the spiciness takes away the sweet taste of seafood. At $14, it\'s not too budget friendly I think. 
Sweet and succulent breast meat. Yes, BREAST MEAT. üòã\n<br />#blueblackwhiteeats

This cappuccino has a stronger coffe taste than what i normally is used too. For those that is not used to it, can be quite overwhelming. But fortunately, it is good coffee! #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafe #cafeculture #cafe #singapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #coffee #foodie #foodporn #cappuccino #cappuccinoart #foodstagram #burrple #laristrettos
This ice chocolate is not chilled by ice cubes but instead by a big ball of chocolate ice cream! Talking abt chocolate over dose! Surprisingly despite of all the chocolate, the drink itself is not too thick! Nice! #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafe #cafeculture #cafe #singapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodie #foodporn #brunch #icechocolate  #foodstagram #burrple #laristrettos

This is one tricky place to find!  U can\'t reach it by taking the lift from the medical centre side to the 8th lvl. U will need to take the lift from the shopping side to the 7th lvl and from there walk out and take the escalator to the 8th lvl.

Certainly wasn\'t expecting this when I ordered a \"Pear Tart\"! #cafe #sg #foodporn
#Coffee, always a good idea ;). Have a great reunion for the Lunar New Year! #lagoonig #flatwhite #nocoffeenolife
This dish is like a big breakfast that has egg (scrambled/poached), salad, sausage, bacon, grilled cherry tomatoes and mushrooms. The portion were generous. Hence, making it value for money. The coffee was good too.
YES pls. #brunch #coffee
Everyone should believe in something

(15) La Ristrettos - Grande and cafe latte.. I wouldn\'t know where it\'s not exactly located without the help of a friend.. well guys, it\'s on the 8th floor of the medical center.. I.. love.. the.. ambience... It\'s like waking up on a Christmas morning, not just because of the decors of the place, but the feeling I get when I stepped in their door. I\'ll definitely, be back to this place.. the food is great, and quite affordable.. :) #cafehopping #cafestovisitinsg #cafehunt #cafehunting #cafehuntingday #coffee #latte #sg #singapore #brunch #saturday #saturdaybrunch #foodie #food #foodporn #weekend #burpple #laristrettos

$14. Not really filling but it could be cause I shared it with my friend. The ambience is really good! However, the dish slightly too salty for my liking.
