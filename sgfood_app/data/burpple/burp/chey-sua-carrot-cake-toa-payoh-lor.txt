Has always been closed whenever I visit this Hawker Centre. I can say it\'s now one of my favorites! On a side note, Happy Friday Everyone(: #tgif #breakfast #carrotcake #carbs #goodfood #famous #eggs
$2 to $5. More like oyster omelette than the conventional carrot cake, this is slightly crispy on one side with chilli being infused in the egg.
Second generation now, their carrot cakes are made fresh daily and their unique way of frying their \'pancake\' carrot cakes won them a place in the Michelin Guide.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Taste: Love it. They cut the carrot cakes into small pieces and mix them like fillings in an omelette, hence the pancake style. Very yummy and can tell they take time to fry them... that\'s why we waited for an hour... üòì\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Price: $3\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Portion: Good size for $3\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Service: Self-Service\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Add: 127 Toa Payoh Lorong 1 #02-30\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#eatwithroy #thefindersingapore #sgig #singapore #foodandbeverage #supportlocalsg #supporthawker #iphonese #foodie #8dayseat #foodporn #foodpics #foursquarefinds #topcitybites #singaporeinsiders #burpple #eatingfortheinsta #foodfetish #uncagestreetfood #cheysuacarrotcake #toapayoh #asianfoodchannel #toapayohgoodfood

But we were grateful that we didn‚Äôt need to queue and can just wait patiently at our seats while ordering other food in between.. while it kinda look like a omelette, it has a very old skool flavor with the chye poh and subtle sweetness (from the Sambal?) taking center stage. While I‚Äôm more of a black carrot cake person, I find myself beginning to appreciate CTK minus the sweet sauce now and instead jus appreciating the whole seasoning and texture of it. Best in Singapore or not, you‚Äôll be the judge, but this one certainly has the best of both worlds as it‚Äôs not really white but is slightly tan!\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#cheysua#caitaokueh#cheysuacarrotcake#friedcarrotcake#whitecarrotcake#toapayoh#michellin#bibgourmandsg#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending
Super fried carrot cake @ Chey Sua carrot cake üòã\n<br />******\n<br />Have been waiting for so long as the Toa Payoh was closed back in June. Today is a lucky day!! We managed to order a fried carrot cake from the much talked about stall in Toa Payoh market &amp; food centre. The stall got awarded by Michelin Bib gourmand twice in a roll but what got us interested is that they are sketched in \"We ‚ù§Ô∏è Toa Payoh\" series book by Urban Sketcher Singapore. The 2 sisters are the driving force behind this stall (one take order and another one cooked up a storm!)üå™\n<br />.\n<br />We waited like 15 mins at around noon. The stall is said to be closed at 1 pm but we check the clock and they are still operating! üëç Their homemade fried white radish (white carrot) taste really nice with good texture and Chilli. The takeaway packet looks traditional &amp; what a generous portion for $2!! ü§ó\n<br />.\n<br />Nearest MRT: Braddell (5 mins walk)\n<br />#02-34 Blk 127 Lor 1 Toa Payoh \n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#heritageeats #cheysua #friedcarrotcake #raddish #localeats #heritageeats #whattoeat #singapore #michelin #bibgourmand #urbansketchers #sgfood #sgfoodie #foodie #foodblogger #makansutra #chaitowkway

B\'cos of the way they fry it with a crispy crust in top of a soft kueh beneath? The chilli they used that carried a subtle sweetness? The generous portion of egg that balanced with the kueh? \n<br />Definitely gotta wait to lay your hands on a plate of this, but not that big a problem since there are many other good local food in this market to try while waiting. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #carrotcake

My preference of carrot cake should be white and pan-fried till crisp with lots of eggs and chai por.
One of the best in spore. Crispy on the outside. Soft on the inside $2. Opening hrs 7am to 12.30pm. Closed on Mondays #sgfood #sghawker #foodporn #carrotcake #toapayoh #burrple
