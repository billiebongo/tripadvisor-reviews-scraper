.\n<br />Szechuan classics with a light Japanese touch.\n<br />.\n<br />Unlike the usual spiciness which smack right at your face, Chen\'s rendition was somewhat mellower and balanced, with an occasional tinge of numbness when you bite into the peppercorn.
Crispy Noodle with Seafood
Dan Dan Mien (Soup)
Szechwan Popcorn Chicken
Slightly greasy due to the chilli oil but overall a very comforting bowl to cure those hunger pangs. I would also highly recommend the Dan Dan Mien which might seem unassuming at first sight, but it was actually my favourite over the Mapo Don. The al dente noodles were coated thoroughly with the Szechuan spices and the all-important peanut sauce, creating an umami bomb from each bite. The tossed noodles were so good on its own that you don‚Äôt even need the minced meat that‚Äôs on top of it. The best part is that you can now have the best of both worlds as there is a set menu consisting of a Mapo Don and Dan Dan Mien for a single pax.\n<br />_________________\n<br />Chen‚Äôs Mapo Tofu\n<br />Address: 6A, Shenton Way, Downtown Gallery, Unit 02-29, Singapore 068809\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #restaurantsg

I actually liked this a lot üòçüòç. Probably because I love dan dan mian! Similar to the mapo tofu in my previous post, it would have been nice to have it slightly more spicy.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_chensmapotofu #chensmapotofu #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Mapo tofu on a bowl of Japanese rice. Similar to the  main restaurant, Shisen Hanten, the food is less spicy and more subdued compared to the bold Szechuan flavours you typically get in China. Although I would have preferred it a little more spicy, it was nonetheless still very yummy.\n<br />*\n<br />Definitely wouldn\'t mind coming back again!

üî∏üî∏\n<br />Mapo tofu is one of my \"once in a while\" kinda eats. So as you can see, the rice is totally submerged and smothered by the luscious, wobbly, soft tofu with minced meat fiery sauce. At first mouthful, the heat singes the palate for a sec. Afterwhich, the palate becomes comfy and numbing even. Perfect matrimony with the rice. Perfect for cold days. Perfect when one feels the need for heat.
