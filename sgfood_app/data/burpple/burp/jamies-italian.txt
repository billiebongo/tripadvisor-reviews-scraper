In fact it was probably one of the best mushroom risotto‚Äôs I‚Äôve had this year. \n<br />Grain cooked with an umami rich mushroom broth, the addition of mozzarella and EVO was a great touch. A shot of contrast against the tang of the risotto\'s mellowness from the mushroom. The said effect is almost magical ‚Äî¬Ä¬î immensely intense if you\'re eating the whole dish by yourself, perhaps, but a small essay in the interplay of richnesses underlined by the toasty fragrance of the creamy carnaroli rice. \n<br />I really enjoyed how it wasn‚Äôt mushy and overcooked but slightly chewy and exquisitely creamy, indications of a risotto made with care. While my head tells me it might parcooked but my stomach tells me to shut up and enjoy it.
i loved the interior of the restaurant; spacious yet rustic with plenty of natural light streaming in through the bay facing windows. \n<br />Following Jamie Oliver‚Äôs food channel on youtube, I was familiar with Gennaro Contaldo, the Italian chef on his channel so naturally i was excited to try his Tagliatelle Bolognese ($26.50). This meaty long-simmered Bolognese was of grandmother standard. Warm, comforting with liberal usage of red wine i.e all kinds of delicious. The breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese gave it a mellow bite which easily balanced the flavours of the sauce. The pastas are all made in house, a nice touch and cooked a few seconds short of al dente letting the warm sauce finish the job.

2 course meal here at $21.90++ during lunch time which is pretty worth it as the mains itself are already about $20. I got the penne carbonara as the main and as for desserts got 3 mini scoops of ice cream (flavours changes everyday) and 2 toppings. The \"mini\" scoops were actually pretty damn big. Really really filling and not sure why there\'s quite a number of negative reviews but I\'ve been here twice and the food\'s pretty good. 
It\'s was a decent plate of pasta but I had better ones to be honest. Maybe my expectations was really high when they claim it\'s their \"famous\" Prawn linguine. On the bright side, it has a  generous portion of prawns !!! :) Used entertainer for 1 for 1 main course
Cheesy, meaty, saucy, messy goodness. We also cleaned the creamy earthy mushroom risotto off the plate. If you have to eat carbs, eat these!  #cheatday review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio. Something for you to think about this weekend! #thursdayisthenewfriday
Now available at the vivocity outlet too. Their pasta bolognese is üòçtoo!! Head on down for the last day of their gourmet market pop up. I got my hands on that lovely aged balsamic and wheat germ bread. Yay!! Do not try that crazy chili though. You\'ve been warned. #jamiesitaliansg
Fans of Jamie\'s already had their slices from the Forum outlet. So I am happy to inform you that their popular artisan pizza are also available in VivoCity branch. Thin crust and doughy, their pizza sure is very classic in every way. Fresh ingredients well thought out are thrown carelessly on top. And accompanied by their personally handpicked and brought in from Italy, Wine and Prosecco, I can guarantee that you will have a good time at Jamie\'s Italian. 
Just like life, this is e time to rest, to spend more time with our loved ones and to wine &amp; dine. Weeehheeee. Beautiful Sat should begin with some yummy wines. Do you know that Jamie Oliver serves some really delicious selection of wine? I don\'t till weeks ago when I also tried their newly launched pizzas üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Head down to Jamie\'s Italian for their fine selection of wine, that you can enjoy while dinning in. Personally hand-picked, and flown down into their stores, Jamie\'s Italian mean serious business when it comes to their wine. My personal favourite would be the Guerrieri Rizzardi Prosecco (Extra Dry), a great drink to start with any meal. Dry, but extremely light, perfect with cheese and bread. Hint of citrus notes could be tasted, this Prosecco certainly is good any given hot weather! Another personal favourite would be the Gavi La Scolca Oro. The perfect by the beach white wine, this wine has a tart finish note, but clean tasting that it will certainly go well with any seafood pairing. Lastly, many Sinagporean favourite would be their all-rounder sweet, Costa De Bussia Chardonnay. Delectably sweet, a great ladies drink (or for all those sweet-loving people). Tangy and lively, this wine pairs well with white meat. 
Despite the bad reviews, I gave Jamie\'s Italian a go during Restaurant Week, mostly because I enjoyed it in the UK &amp; wanted to see if this lived up to it. Nope. My Crab Spaghettini was tasteless &amp; the pasta was too soft. But I fell in love with my mum\'s Wild Mushroom &amp; Smoked Mozzarella Risotto ($26.50++)... &amp; I thought hey, maybe I\'ll return again.
Insanely good seafood stew filled with sustainable fish &amp; shellfish cooked in a rich tomato &amp;  white wine sauce with fregola, crastini and brown crab. Although I couldn\'t find the fish.... Thumbs up!
$15.50 PER PERSON that include San Daniele prosciutto, pistachio mortadella, bresaola &amp; hot soppressata and served with pecorino &amp; chili jamüëçüèª
The food was good, portion was just enough for one person. Sadly, the dishes were served cold...
The star of the night. Tastes like steamed fish that you might do at home, but with capers, tomatoes and olives. Refreshingly light! A must-have!
Tender chicken in a creamy wild mushroom sauce. Decent, just not \'wow\'. 
Salty! The seasoning was off-kilter; not the most enjoyable of the night. 
.Al-dente pasta running swimming in a sea-salt brine. Nothing special but a good execution, nonetheless. 
Unfortunately, didn\'t taste much garlic. Too faint for my liking. 
Savoury and hearty at the same time; a highly recommended starter. 
Juicy and tender meat, go well with garlic &amp; parsley butter... Healthy rainbow coleslaw with natural yoghurt 
$10.50\n<br />Velvety mascarpone &amp; lemon cheesecake with Italian meringue, lemon curd &amp; blackcurrants
$11.50\n<br />Warm fudgy brownie with amaretto ice cream &amp; caramelised amaretti popcorn
$17\n<br />Pasta nero with mussels, baby octopus, chilli, capers, white wine &amp; parsley
$7.50\n<br />Classic homemade rosemary focaccia, seeded crackerbread &amp; grissini sticks, served with cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil, aged balsamic vinegar &amp; fantastic olive tapenade
$38.00 \n<br />Marinated &amp; cooked under a brick with parsley bagna cauda, apple, kohlrabi, lemon &amp; crispy crackling
Haven\'t been here since their first 6 months of opening or so, and it\'s mainly for their seriously epic brownie. No kidding, it\'s no misnomer ‚Äì that block of chocolate is rich, sweet, fudgey, sticky, slightly chewy, and yet it all melts away in the mouth with unexpected ease. Top it off with crispy caramel popcorn and that heavenly scoop of amaretto ice cream, and we have a clear winner.
Second visit to the restaurant after its opening. The burger was much better than the dishes I have ordered during my first visit. Love the pickles , the crispy fried onions and salsa sauce which brought the burger to another level of tastiness. Looking forward to the new Jamie\'s Italian at Forum\n<br />#burpple #ketohloh #8DAYSEat
Nice ambience, food is quite tasty but it\'s salty and a hefty price! What\'s the hype about?! The service is quite slow but fast when we call for the bill. S$80.62 for pax of 2. Meh.
So smooth &amp; wobbly, it just slides down your throat. A little bit of sweetness from the panna cotta and a little bit of sourness &amp; tangyness from the berries. Reminds me of a song üé§üé∂ i m a little bit country with a little bit of rock n rollüéªüé∑üé∏#pannacotta #dessertlovers #dessert #whati8today #burpple #openricesg
Burger Italiano, Rump Steak and Crispy Squid. Burger was good, lettuce was super fresh and the tomatoes were juicy and tangy. Bread was slightly charred but added a nice smokey taste. Would have preferred if the steak was more flavourful though! Squid wasn\'t crispy :( Loved the truffle tagliatelle when I came previously!
Bone-in grilled lamb chops served with a creamy artichoke &amp; mint sauce, roasted nuts, chilli &amp; fresh mint. If there is one thing that\'s preventing me from trying other items on the menu, this is it.
This is the small serving. Delicious but too little for me. 
How does this Buttie for breakfast sound? http://missneverfull.com/?p=4449
Believe the reviews. It\'s pretty meh. For that price, you find better flavours elsewhere.
Woke up late Saturday and though would try this place out. Coffee is Italian style so expect a hint of robusta in there. Latte was the pick as served in nice glass. Latte art lacking thou. We had the bacon and egg roll which was good on brioche bun. Bacon was good quality. The scrambled eggs was a bit of a disappointment with it being cold. The mrs not happy! Overall for the money I think not great value. Nice atmosphere to look out to sentosa on a  sunny morning. The mixed berry pancakes looks like a good pick spied on others table. Till next time when might try dinner.
We love the wild mushroom risotto and crab spaghettini. The ever-popular crispy polenta chips with parmesan and rosemary is the best highlight of our meal, love her company as always.
Fluffy pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, mixed berries and a huge dollop of orange mascarpone. Don\'t you just love that avalanche of berries? 
@jamiesitaliansg now offers breakfast menu , this Smashed Spicy Avocado will be a good kickstart to your lovely day.
this time for their new weekend-only breakfast menu! enjoyed our gorgeous Toulouse sausage and free-range egg buttie! brings back fond memories of our days in UK...happy Sunday everyone!
Check out their new breakfast menu. It\'s really hearty and value for money.
No need for any fanciful names or out-of-this-world ingredients, what symbolizes a truly magnificent meal is mastering the art of perfecting a simple, homely and comforting dish. The mushroom risotto may not look appealing but it definitely warms the heart.
Prosciutto layered with generous amount of rocket, pine nuts, pecorino and tiny pear slices. Light, fresh and healthy lunch. At $19.50++ not too bad. Recommended for sharing or as a main for 1. I didn\'t share :)
How fancy can a simple man\'s food be? Well, once you douse it in truffle oil and blanket it under heaps of Parmesean cheese, you can.  Warning.  Its extremely addictive.
Who doesn\'t like a big bowl of comforting risotto? This Italian version of a grittier congee is bound to please many.  Jamie\'s version definitely doesn\'t disappoint.  First sense is the aromatic whiff of the wild mushroom that is inviting as well as engulfing then your first taste would be the woody, yet hearty taste of the mushroom risotto. Makes you wanna go, aaahhhhh..... I ordered the dinner portion because i know the small portion is enough to fill the left side is my tummy.  Lol.
It\'s a virgin mojito.. As I have to catch a flight later, better not to touch any alcohol. 
Disappointed......first dish came out raw chicken. They offered another dish for me, it was overlooked. Blah.....
This lightly pan fried then sauce added pink snapper is really good. Have not eaten such a tender fish in a western restaurant. It\'s so smooth that the meat almost melt in your mouth. 
I liked the casual setting of the restaurant, which is good for family and group gatherings. I had the baked salmon for my main, which was neither too overcooked nor too dry, it was cooked just right. I love their pasta! We had the tuna fusilli and mushroom risotto, which were both really good! My family loved it too :) but I must say it\'s kinda pricey and portions are tiny except their pasta that came in more generous portions. 
Simple pasta that tasted absolutely delicious. The cheese in the tortellini were not too heavy, pumpkin sauce was flavourful with a touch of chilli.
At #jamiesitalian . Thank u for the time darlings n thank you @shirdoodoo24 for organizing!!!
Really amazing food, but don\'t spend too long on the photos.
Squid ink angel hair pasta. Don\'t have high expectation because honestly speaking I would say is just alright. Not very fantastic but a really good place for a date. Their calamari was fine, not too bad. They had this entire fish as one of their main, the fish didn\'t really tasted fresh thus the meat wasn\'t very tender but nonetheless give it a try. The spaghetti was a little salty for me, but it was ok for my tastebud. Not too heavy. The soup base of the spaghetti was pretty good, it taste very \"seafood-ish\" hahaha! Not too bad of a place actually, the price was reasonable too. 
Ingredients: Sweet crab tossed with capers, chilli, fennel, parsley, anchovies &amp; lemon. I really like the sweet crabs pieces and its a novelty to me, because its the first I\'ve came across a spaghetti dish which tastes sweet. Must try if you love crab and spaghetti! 
Squid ink pasta, scallops, garlic, chilli, anchovies, wine &amp; capers. Spaghetti is springy, for the sauce it has a tinge of spiciness due to the chili and if you ididn\'t look at the ingredients list you would not know there\'s wine for flavoring. Sauce balances w the pasta although both are heavy flavored, a couple of scallops thrown into this were huge and quite fresh. Priced at $16 for the small portion I think its worth the money to have a try, if you\'re feeling hungry do order a bigger portion.                                 Service was really inadequate as the staffs were just bumming around and we waited a long time just to order and halfway through our meal our drinks were not on the table yet. 
Queue situation is improved and they\'ve got new dishes (olives still good)! Highlights include the signature Porchetta (originally from their Xmas menu), Cauliflower fritters garnished with parmesan, crispy sage &amp; lemon zest, and Aubergine Parmigiana served with homemade garlic bread and heritage tomato salad.
Prawn was so small, texture of pasta was chewy and not as tasty as I expect from an Italian kitchen. 
My first visit here during a pre-opening lunch session was marred by glacially slow service and underwhelming food when we finally got it 40 minutes later. We returned several months later, hoping that they would have ironed out the kinks. Unfortunately the same problems still persist. Sadly, we were only to be disappointed after an interminably long wait. The carbonara was the only saving grace amongst the 3 pasta dishes ordered, and it barely passed muster itself, being dry and scimping on the bacon. The other 2 seafood pastas fared worse - the handmade linguine of the day was way too thick and the fish stock used was overly fishy and insipid at the same time.
Pillowy soft polenta cubes thinly encrusted by a crisp exterior, lightly dusted with parmesan shavings and sea salt. This is simple food executed perfectly. 
Quite a number of tasty vegetarian dishes this time. But first some proteins for me! Decent salmon with a whipped lemon ricotta. #yummy
The brownie was strongly recommended by our friendly waitress whose service was impeccable. The brownie had the consistency of a fudge pudding mix. The selling point of the tiramisu was the orange mascarpone. (At the risk of sounding like an alcoholic) Where was the liquor? üò¢
We heard mixed reviews about this place but so far we are enjoying everything.
The best tiramisu I\'ve tasted hands down. So moist and so yummy. I want some more ! #love #food #cakes
AMAAAAAAAZING!!!!! I loved it! The food the most, then ambience (really cool restaurant layout) + concept of getting to choose diff. Size portions!
Ordered this since it was sposedly the recommended dish (&amp;ive read so many good reviews) but I barely managed to finish it. Was so thankful I ordered the smaller portion ($14) ARRGH. Not a fan of its saltiness and sourness. The only good thing to me was the texture of the fusilli. üòí
Rich goooooey brownie accompanied by salted caramel popcorn that just hit  my dessert spot. Mmmmmmm... 
Desserts were pretty good.
Somehow missed dining here the past few times, finally made it here tonight. Really liked the Polenta Chips. Girls night out - TGIF!
Yummylicious crispy squid. But very pricey. Approximately 7-8 pcs for $12!\n<br />Overpriced. Most likely people dine there just because its opened by jamie oliver..
Crispy Squid, Wild Truffle Risotto, and Garlicky Prawn Pasta for starters and mains.  Verdict: Good was so-so, but I already had lowered expectations so it was fine #foodgasm #foodporn #instafood
With spicy Italian sausage, pancetta, mussels, clams, white wine, black olives, sweet baby tomatoes &amp; field mushrooms
Beef me up, Jamie! My very first experience at a @jamieoliver\'s restaurant. Great start with this delicious melange of 180g aged grain-fed Angus steak with crunchy fennel, watercress, mint, chilli, garlic, horseradish &amp; lemon. Simple deliciousness for a hot Saturday here on the island | #food #foodporn #salad #jamiesitalian #vscocam #vscofood #instaweekend
Fries dashed with truffle oil and Parmesan. This is a good dish to complement your main course. Fries are flavourful but I hope for it to be more crispy. Price is $7.50
The dish is flavourful and tasty. Find the broth a bit salty but overall the dish is great. Price is $24 for main course portion
The description sure sounded promising: \"Fresh strawberries with strawberry jelly, custard &amp; glazed Italian meringue\". The reality was a disappointment. Firstly, the strawberry jelly was in a liquid state. Secondly, when we questioned a waiter about it, he went off to check and a different gentleman returned (presumably the manager), who apologized and told us that it was \"delivered that way\" earlier. And there weren\'t any that had the jelly properly set. Which immediately begs two questions. #1 - Why serve it if you knew it wasn\'t actually done right (especially if the customer is shelling out $9.50 for it)? #Number 2 - Why are the desserts being delivered? Aren\'t they meant to be made in the restaurant\'s kitchen itself? We were still scratching our heads when we left.
The Angus beef on bone prime rib cost $59.50 plus an extra $5 because I craved a dollop of truffle butter with shaved Tuscan black truffles. Served with tiny wild mushrooms &amp; a mixed leaf salad, I was prepared to be impressed but sadly, I wasn\'t. The beef had a lot of tough gristly bits which meant there was barely 200gms of it left that was edible, after you minus those impossible-to-chew parts and the large bone. In my opinion, this restaurant is possibly more style than substance.
tad too salty...
But love the grilled chicken. Pretty pricey thou. But what to expect at this place #jamiesitalian #food
Dim but lovely casual place, and so Christmassy now! Enjoyed dining there with good service. (Food were hits and misses I guesssss but I\'ll be back!)
Epic brownie ($11.50), warm fudge brownie with amaretto ice cream &amp; caramelised amaretti popcorn. Sweet, but darn good. #burpple
$32.50 (ordered the large one, but portion was actually quite little). It wasn\'t fantastic. Spicy italian sausage (no impression), pancetta, mussels, clams, white wine, black olives, sweet baby tomatoes &amp; field mushrooms. 
$32. Pink snapper, panfried with olives, garlic, wine, capers &amp; tomatoes. The savoury sauce was so damn good and the fish was really fresh!!
The pork chop was wonderfully done.. Tantalizing taste and delicious aroma..
Devouring this 350g 30day matured prime rib with truffle butter and shaved black truffle! #jamieoliver
Sustainable halibut baked to perfection with spring vegetable stew, pancetta, the prettiest fried artichokes, crostini and lemony yoghurt dressing. Yes, yes, yes and yes!
That comes with the crab &amp; avocado bruschetta. I figured that they are the avocado and crab dipping paste. 
I have a slight reservation in them. The bread base was thin and crackling but the crab filling hasn\'t been too delightful. Wasn\'t quite pleased with the stench or weird after-taste flavors. Skip if strong seafood accent irks u, it did on me so I\'m not ordering it if I ever return for a 3rd time.
A revisit: the Polenta chips are the bomb. Featured in corn cubes, deep fried with a bit of crisp edging the sides but soft texture with a comforting warmth in each bite. I love every moments of them in my mouth. Absolutely gorgeous. 
Epic Brownie. There\'s none other like this insanely incredible block of chocolate fudge that melts the instant it\'s enveloped in the mouth. Served with amaretto ice cream and caramelised amaretti popcorn, this truly deserves its moniker. #brownie #chocolate #dessert #sweet #amaretto #icecream #popcorn #sugarhigh #foodporn #jamiesitalian #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Raspberry Frangipane. A sweet and tart combi of berries and almond pastry, with creme fraiche ice cream and berry drizzle. It\'s not terrible; just not what I\'d choose to eat again. #dessert #frangipane #tart #raspberry #icecream #jamiesitalian #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Mortadella &amp; Ricotta Panzerotti. Al dente pasta stuffed with mortadella and minced chicken, served in a creamy blue cheese sauce, and garnished with crispy pancetta, crinkle-cut apple, and toasted spiced walnuts. YUM!!! #pasta #panzerotti #pancetta #italianfood #sgfood #jamiesitalian #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Crab &amp; Avocado Bruschetta. A thin slice of toasted sourdough topped with wisps of crabmeat, yoghurt, slivers of apple, chilli, mint and lemon - light and refreshing with the accompanying avocado and crabmeat pastes. #bruschetta #sourdough #crab #avocado #italianfood #sgfood #jamiesitalian #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Crispy Tomato &amp; Mozzarella Arancini. Crumbed rice balls with a heart of mozzarella, in rich tomato sauce - too bad the shells were a tad soggy and didn\'t have a satisfying crunch. #arancini #rice #tomato #italianfood #jamiesitalian #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob
Four different types of meats, a selection of olives and chilli, mozzarella cheeses and shredded carrot, radish and beet root. $15.50 per person. Note: order for one and shared if you still want to try the other dishes. We ordered 2 small pasta, a side dish and 2 desserts.
Whatever this is for, let the theatrics begin! #foodporn #jamiesitalian @jonahwongofficial
\"World\'s best olives on ice\" - large green olives, black olive tapenade and crispy \'music bread\'.\n<br />Usually any claims of \'best\' would be a let down but omg, these were indeed the BEST olives I\'ve ever had. They\'re really called olive verdi dolci - Bella di Cerignola..plump juicy olives without any hint of bitterness, almost tasting sort of creamy without being too salty! üòç
Not sure how our Teppei reservation was put down as 22/10 instead but some genius booked a plan B backup plan at the same time Teppei was booked! #jamiesitaliansg it is! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Decent food that is worth at least 1try but nothing to scream about.
Crispy fried potenta; taste and texture almost like deep fried tofu. A side dish that is more interesting than the main
This is their weekly special and its really special. Not too soupy and really succulent beef. Above all the mesh potato is really yummy. Excellent meal. 
Fresh olives on a bed of ice makes sense as the olives taste really well. Good way to start a meal here. 
The week would not be completed without a sweet ending! The best weekend treat is none other than a classic panna cotta to ward off your tiredness. Lovingly sweet and creamy rich, simply heartwarming.   
Ethereal creamy! Memorable treat that I could eat repeated without feeling sick. The wobbly creme pudding was sweet but not cloying, the tart berry compote toned down it\'s entire sweetness for a more mellow taste. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
The juicy meat has a balanced flavor in it, truly enjoyable when cooked medium. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
$17/small portion: lightly seasoned with a notable chili heat in the tomato broth. The prawns were succulent and fresh, though the freshly made linguine was a tad too al dente. It will be perfect if the chef can cook it to suit Asian palate, I prefer a slightly soft exterior with a hard middle, not an entirely stiff strand. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
VERy well-seasoned with a impressive charred surface. My angus piece was cooked medium with a tender pink centering the meat. A balanced flavor in the main accompanied by a small heap of honeyed balsamic drizzled rocket &amp; mushroom mix serve alongside. A $59.50 needn\'t require a touch of truffle but it was already a magnificent piece on its own. Share out this 350g, I think it fills 2 comfortably if u add a small pasta to your meal. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
$7.50 for 15 small deep fried ravioli! Gotta try. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
Served with \"fiery\" (just a name but it was indeed tomato pasta sauce alike) arrabbiata sauce; this antipasti scored higher than the baked mushroom. The dip clearly heightens the crispy fried \"ravioli\" stuffed with a teeny helping of pumpkin mozzarella filling; topped with sweet amaretti (almond) bits. The result was a harmonious sweet tang + gently salted taste. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
The antispasti was slightly anaemic in taste but the magic bread was so paper-thin that it breaks easily with a touch. The portobello mushroom was juicy within a film of melted mozzarella cheese. It has been good but didn\'t top the marks. Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
Another non-alcohol but today\'s special : a unique combo with slightly more peachy than tangy, the basil enliven the drink with a distinct herbal note. $7/glass, it\'s a great quencher! Here\'s my thought on the dishes: http://www.epinosh.com/jamies-italian-singapore/
Local fish of the day with clams, mussels, fennel, chilli, anchovies &amp; fregola sarda
Ragu of beef, pork, herbs, chianti &amp; Parmesan with crunchy, herby breadcrumbs
We were lucky to wait only for an hour on a Saturday. Overall the dishes are of average standard. I will recommend to give it a try if the waiting time is reduced. 
ordered medium and it came just nice! No streams of blood flowing but meat is adequately red! with truffle and butter, oh! what the delish! :)
30-Day matured prime rib; Honeycomb cannelloni three-ways; Seafood bucatini; Wild truffle risotto.
It was really thick and rich. Too much for my liking. Flavors were lacking.
Best dish of the night. Squid was light and crunchy, albeit small portions. 
The freshly made pasta was tasty but very much al dente--something I didn\'t fancy. Pastas are available in 2 portions-small &amp; big-which is good for the pocket as well. The burger was juicy and tender, though a tad expensive. The lemon meringue pie was rather disappointing. Hello &amp; goodbye, Jamie. 
Thankyou @gabchua for making my day better by bringing me somewhere we\'ve been meaning to try :) not too sure about the hype over the Polenta Chips and i\'m sure @helloinfinite is gonna punch me for ordering the Wild Mushroom Risotto when she said not to (i should have listened) but we really loved the Baked Mushrooms and Tuna Fusilli! #dinner #onthetable #nofilter
I\'m finally here. However, too full from lunch. Had this nice dessert only. 
Wonderful #dinner with @tribalzoid tonight! So excited to finally be here :) love the place, great service and yummy food! #tgif
Pretty decent food with a lively kitchen. Had food coma while driving back. #lunch #friends
The meat was fresh, tender &amp; juicy with sweet olive-wine infused sauce. Crabmeat risotto was decent, not as stunning in taste but the texture &amp; consistency of the rice was done just right IMO. Tiramisu was good and the homemade orange-vanilla ice-cream enhanced it by leaps. #jamieitalian #jamieitaliansg
The fish is good but it did not worth the price. Meet up w bryan
Black Angel Spaghetti. Just wondering, if you wear sunnies, can you see your food?
Wagyu steak with smoked mozzarella, pancetta, sticky balsamic onions, tomato, pickles &amp; chillies
Creamy risotto made with incredible acquerello rice and topped with lemony crab, samphire &amp; chilli
Tart berries, sweet almond filling, served with clementine rippled sour cream
Best out of the 3 mains we had, albeit serving was a bit small. 
Slow braised fennel sausage ragu with red wine, Parmesan and crunchy herby breadcrumbs 
Creamy Panna Cotta. This vanilla bean pudding wobbled on to the table and straight into my mouth. So delish with the tart berries and compote. #pannacotta #sweet #sour #dessert #italianfood #sgfood #ilovemyjob #foodporn #burpple
Rump Steak Salad. 180-day grain fed angus with fennel, horseradish, watercress, mint, chilli, garlic and lemon. Liked the season on the steak, hated the overpowering greens. #steak #beef #salad #italianfood #sgfood #foodporn #ilovemyjob #burpple
Jools\' Favorite Sicilian Tuna Fusilli. Silky, springy fusilli with slow-cooked albacore tuna in a tomato, herb and cinnamon sauce.

Pink Snapper Acqua Pazza at Jamie\'s Italian. I highly recommend this dish!
Epic Brownie ($11.50): warm fudgy brownie with ice cream sans the caramelised amaretti popcorn and the less indulgent Baked Fruit Almond Tart ($9.50) with a drizzle of honey, smashed amaretti and Chantilly cream.
If you\'re not a big fan of olives, give these a try and you might just change your mind. Take a bite of the chilled olive and discover a smooth, almost creamy flesh that is not too overwhelming in taste. 
Had a super crazy heavy dindin with Luyan. From 8pm till 11pm. #burpple

Local fish of the day with clams, mussels, fennel, chilli, anchovies &amp; fregola sarda
Please do not sit outdoor unless you\'re a smoker. Now the fish - very fresh and tasty. Comes with clams and mussels too. Must try if you\'re a fish person. 
Looked delicious but was disappointingly dry and bland. Did not come with any sides and for $27, a tad too expensive. On the plus side, there was 50% off all food items prior to tomorrow\'s official opening :)
The saving grace - fennel seed buns baked in-house.
We still got space in our tum tum for #dessert! Yummy! It\'s good food with @hohumzz though thy need a little more training in service.
The bits of orange peel harmonises so well with the orange mascarpone, coffee and kahlua flavoured sponge and chocolate shavings. Definitely hard to find something that‚Äôs comparable to this. Funky chips was decent but goes great with their in-house mayonnaise, so do request for it. Sakura tea tasted like IKEA candles as it has a strong perfumed fragrance attached to it.. Certainly not my cup of tea (pun intended).\n<br />„Éª\n<br />#burpple #FoodiegohHarbourFront\n<br />„Éª\n<br />„Éª\n<br />„Éª\n<br />„Éª\n<br />„Éª\n<br />#instadailyphoto #photooftheday #followme #picoftheday #follow #instadaily #food #yummy #foodstagram  #foodgasm #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #dailyinsta #foodsg #singaporefood #whati8today #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #8dayseat #singaporeinsiders #singaporeeats #sgfoodtrend #sgigfoodie #thisisinsiderfood #foodinsingapore #foodinsing

In our honest opinion, the steak was poorly seasoned, overdone and bitter from the grill. The spaghetti had the most flavour, but it was unevenly seasoned and we encountered one bite which was pure salt! The lasagne was probably the most decent but also not great and a bit artificial tasting. And the best part about the superfood salad was probably a well-chosen avo.  Let\'s just say, the poor lighting was not the only lousy thing on the table. üëéüèª *Entertainer: 1-1 main course (but even with the savings, I still do not think it\'s worth it!) #igfood #igeats #foodislove #foodie #hungrygowhere #burpple #burppleSG #wte #whattoeat #sgfood #sgeats #igsgfood #igsgeats #eatoutsg #foodsg #instafood #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instafoodie #singapore #exploreflavours #exploresingaporeeats #honestreviews #shotwithaniphone #iphonewarrior #jamieitaliansg

Every corner and detail is stunning. However, food is decently average and doesn\'t live up to the hypeüòØ. Tried their signature Tagliatelle Bolognese pasta and artisanal spicy meatball pizza, and was very disappointed with the standards. Feels there\'s so much room to improve as they claimed the pasta and pizza were made from scratch and the freshest ingredients available. Maybe I expect too much from a celebrity chef\'s restaurantü§î. #italianfood #eeeeeats #sgeats #sgfoodies #italianfood #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgfoodtrend #sgfood #foodstagram #vscosg #NomNom #feedfeed #sgeats

Quite decent in fact.
Pizza dough is made fresh daily from a combination of manitoba (a premium Italian bread flour), yeast and water. The dough is shaped through gentle stretching (not rolling) which is key to developing its crisp texture and crust.  It is also served on a special stoneware plate which retains the heat and crispness of the pizzas for longer.\n<br />.\n<br />Location: 1 HarbourFront Walk, VivoCity, #01-165 to 167, Singapore 098585\n<br />.\n<br />#jamiesitalian #jamiesitaliansg #pizza #burpple #burpplesg

Pretty tasty. Perhaps a little too salty, though! 
An interesting but strangely appealing grainy texture to the sponge that is punctuated with citrusy hits of orange, and pieces of fresh mandarin to adorn the top and side of the cake for that zesty punch, that is smothered with the creamy dollop of creme fraiche to luxuriate the fruity sponge. Kinda simple, kinda delightful and kinda nice way to end the meal :)\n<br />#orangepolentacake #cremefraiche #sgfood #sgrestaurant #foodporn #burpple #jamiesitaliansg

Rigatoni Pomodoro (bottom) ($12.50) &amp; Prawn Linguine (top) ($18). Both were Small portions. Do NOT order the small portions if you are hungry as they are really small. I would have ordered the large portion if I knew. However, the Rigatoni Pomodoro tasted great, the breadcrumbs gave it a good flavour! Prawn linguine was good also!
But this place has very nice truffle fries. And it\'s friiidayyy!

Had the wagyu beef burger (wasnt great and too tall, so the stuff was falling all over the place), my sister had the pasta which was good, and polenta chips (looks more like tofu) was ok!
Nice spaghetti, but not a lot of crab meat though. 
Awesome black squid spaghetti, love the aroma and taste. 
Awesome taste, crispy and chewy.
Aromatic mushroom, great taste..
Truffle risotto. Overrated
