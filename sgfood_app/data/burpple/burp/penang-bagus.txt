We were meant to introduce @blueskiescottonclouds to the Chendol Bingsu here, which by the way tastes better than conventional chendol, but I ended up ordering injeolmi toast as well. Tony, one of the founders, encouraged me to add cheese so it became cheese injeolmi toast.\n<br />*\n<br />It was very tasty. Injeolmi is a  type of Korean glutinous rice cake. The toast is typically dipped into condensed milk. The addition of cheese made it slightly savoury, which was a nice contrast to the sweetness. I liked this version better than some of the ones I\'ve had in Korea. Less sweet but yet maintaining the authenticity of the taste.\n<br />*\n<br />You may be wondering why there is Korean influence. One of the founders is a Korean lady by the name of Grace. She is responsible for the fantastic desserts available.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_penangbagus #penangbagus #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
*\n<br />Penang prawn mee. This was pretty authentic. The soup was full of prawn flavour. I added pork ribs for an extra $2. Definitely do that as it made the dish tastier.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_penangbagus #penangbagus #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Founded by Penangites Tony and Jeff (who fries the char kuay teow), as well as a Korean lady, Grace (who makes the bingsu).\n<br />*\n<br />When Tony told us that we should try the char kuay teow personally fried by Jeff himself, we immediately ordered another plate. True enough, the already very tasty char kuay teow just got better!\n<br />*\n<br />The restaurant was very bright and cheery with prints of famous Penang murals on its walls. Felt like you just stepped into Penang 😂. Thanks @veronicaphua for introducing us to @penangbagus. Will definitely come back for more.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_penangbagus #penangbagus #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
While not necessarily a Penang dish, the fried chicken was very delicious. The batter was light and crispy. Popular with the kids but the adults polished off quite a fair bit as well.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_penangbagus #penangbagus #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was truly the best chendol I\'ve had. The shaved ice was extremely fine (bingsu) and was made of coconut milk. The taste and texture was therefore more refined than the usual thick coconut milk poured over shaved ice made of water.\n<br />*\n<br />You must be wondering why there is Korean influence. One of the three founders, Grace, is a Korean. There are many other bingsu flavours to choose from. We tried the mango bingsu too but the chendol was still my favourite.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_penangbagus #penangbagus #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Ever since Penang Road Cafe in Novena closed down many years ago, we have been on a hunt to locate an alternative. We thought we found a replacement at the Tangs Market but the quality has since deteriorated.\n<br />*\n<br />You can imagine our excitement when @veronicaphua said Penang Bagus was the real deal. We tried the char kuay teow and we totally agree! Very authentic other than the obviously missing \'see hum\' (cockles).\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_penangbagus #penangbagus #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

At $6.50, I dare say it\'s a conservative price coming from an air conditioned eatery. Portion is somewhat small but what they lack is made up by taste.. After the first bite, I knew that this is for real. The prawns, chinese sausage, and the other PCKT seasoning is prominent! There\'s even wok hei! The bonus is there are a few crispy chunks of lard which really gives you the extra bite and satisfaction! I love the texture as this is not oily too! By far, it\'s one of the best I\'ve tried!\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#penangckt#penangcharkwayteow#penangbagus#penangcharkueyteow#charkueyteow#charkwayteow#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#penangfood#stfoodtrending
