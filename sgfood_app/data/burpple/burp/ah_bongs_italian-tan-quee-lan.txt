Affordable lunch sets priced at $12 are on the weekday menu but this meat ragu was sooo worth the +$6 top up.\n<br />Pasta was well cooked and firm to the bite, but it was the ragu that made me wanna lick my plate clean at the end of the meal. Balanced with both beef and pork, the meat sauce was not overpowering at all. Instead, it was well balanced savoury goodness coupled with extra tender beef cheeks.\n<br />I just had this a couple of days ago, but I\'m already dreaming of going back for this again. And of course, to finally get my hands on the highly raved Burrata &amp; the new Truffle Pig Ears.
Generous portion of crab, with lovely crabby juices going with the linguine. Cherry tomatoes &amp; asparagus add color &amp; texture as well. This was $16, well worth the ingredients and quality cooking. The place will do well with a better atmosphere... but I\'ll definitely come for the food!:)
$12 + $2 top up\n<br />Topped up $2 for their homemade drink and as a fan of sour drinks, I really loved the orange homemade drink, which name I\'m not so sure of. The pasta and brownie was just average but definitely a filling meal. The lunch set is $12, a main course, a drink and a dessert.
Really liked the mushroom and chewy pasta! Rather light in flavour though so do try the meaty angus beef pasta if u want something heavier
Gave this a go but was pretty let down by how hastily my Crab Meat Aglio Olio ($16) was put tgt, giving no texture or flavors in this main that could potentially crab walk its way into my heart. Big, honest portion but would I pay $16 to eat this again? No ‚òπÔ∏èÔ∏è
It\'s been a while since I\'ve paid a visit to Ah Bong\'s Italian, so it\'s only right for me to sample the newest dish they have to offer. Their new Hunter\'s Pomodoro ($21 with fresh, house made pasta) certainly made the pilgrimage back worth it.
Most comforting and savoury pasta dish of all time. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. The ragu sauce is rich, beefy and coats the pasta well, and every mouthful is full of delicious goodness. It is so good that I always make sure I get every last bit of ragu sauce on my plate and leave nothing behind!!
Homemade Crab Cakes ($8 nett)
Truffle Mushroom Risotto ($16 nett)
First time at Ah Bong\'s (yes very late I know) to try their pastas!!!! Ordered the crabby aglio alio ($16) which had a lovely distinctive sweetness from the fresh tomatoes, and the Angus meat ragu ($16), with tender beef cheek and duroc pork which was smoky, savoury and not too salty. \n<br />Get their sea salt marscarpone gelato ($4/scoop) if it\'s available because it\'s seriously addictive - sweet, salty and creamy with the right amount of milkiness. Will be back to try their homemade pasta!!
üòâ If not, why not check out Ah Bong\'s Italian that\'s conveniently located a stone\'s throw away from Bugis MRT. Well-known for their pasta, expect new surprises with their daily rotational menu! Psst: there\'s also an outlet at tiong bahru hawker centre but it\'s ceasing operations on 28 feb! üò¢üò¢
Crab aglio olio @ $16 nett. Loved the infusion, tasty! Not a very fancy place, but it\'s good if ya want a hearty home cooked feel and a comfortable place to htht/catch upüë•
Angus Meat Ragu ($21 for homemade pasta)
Affordable pastas &amp; their yummy \"Almost there\" pork belly make tonight\'s dinner a good one.
The first place that would probably pop into any Burpple Tastemaker\'s mind when you mention Bugis would be Ah Bong\'s Italian, purely because the food is hearty and the prices affordable. It looks small from the outside, and it\'s almost always packed, but there are additional outdoor tables to accommodate bigger groups. Come with your carb-loving friends and plan to eat chef-owner Chris\'s amazing pastas like the Fresh Pesto ($12) and the signature Birthday Pasta ($9). The latter, described in Burpple Tastemaker Russell Leong\'s words, features \"roasted broccoli pesto that is earthy, hearty and bursting with fantastic flavor\". If you\'re a regular patron here, or \"superfans\", as Chef Chris calls the Burpple Tastemakers, you\'ll find yourself sampling his experimental dishes pretty often, like the Almost There Pork Belly ($12) that comes with melt-in-the-mouth fat and perfectly crackling skin ‚Äî a dish that has been in the works since last July. Pro tip: Swing by at lunch to enjoy any pasta, a drink and a small dessert at only $12!\n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Russell Leong
The newest family member in Ah Bong\'s lineup is definitely not to be looked pasta. This delicious plate of duroc pork Genovese is a fairly accurate representation of Ah Bong\'s dishes: simple, yet complex, rich, and seriously mouthwatering.
With chunky mangalitsa pork sausage, topped with mushroom, Parmesan, Onsen egg, and fragrant truffle oil. Simple yet flavourful, the Comfort Eggs ($8) were true to its name! #burpple #burpplebestbugis
\"Almost There\" Pork Belly ($12) was our unanimous favourite of the night with tender pork, melt in the mouth fat and that perfectly crackling skin! Served with delish little explosively juicy cherry tomatoes. #burpple #burpplebestbugis
A taste of seafood, in this case- crab. Fresh ingredients &amp; al dente pasta! Comfort food for seafood lovers. My friend loves it! ($16) (At bugis branch)
A good plate for sharing, gets too jelat after half a plate. Risotto is cooked Al dente, you can request for a softer texture from the chef. Strong truffle smell for truffle lovers &amp; generous portion of mushroom for mushroom lovers! (Bugis branch)
A taste of homeüòä very much a pleasant meal, simple and nice! $16 for this, no gst! Lunchtime promotion costs $12 for a set meal, worth it!
The slow braised Angus beef cheek with truffled risotto is without a doubt, the most gut gratifying entr√©e on Ah Bong\'s recent Christmas menu. Loaded with capacious chunks of Angus beef cheeks that have been braised low and slow, roasted pumpkin, and ubiquitous shiitake mushrooms wading in a thick, tasty broth.
previously when i tried ah bong\'s pastas i felt that they were nothing spectacular for the price i was paying. barilla linguine isn\'t the nicest tasting pasta around. \n<br />but after they introduced handmade linguine i found myself back there again and again. it holds the sauce well and each strand of pasta varies in width, making each mouthful ever-so-slightly different. not exactly cheap pasta but reasonably priced considering it\'s handmade. \n<br />time for me to learn to make my own pasta.
I used to think that the old chef\'s adage of the quality of your ingredients being the single most important facet of any dish was a bit far fetched, but Ah Bong\'s has made me realize that it\'s a lot truer than I have previously thought.
Lunch sets here are a really good deal! $12 for any pasta, drink and a small dessert. Sadly the side of truffle fries was nothing to write home about, fries were thickly cut and had a truffle cheese powder and were soso. The pasta on the other hand was delicious, I had the shrimp aglio olio and before I knew it I had finished the plate. Definitely a great budget meal if you\'re in the bugis area!
We ordered the Mushroom Truffle Risotto ($16) which came with perfectly cooked al dante rice! Not everyone\'s a fan of having it al dante, but I loved it! Each mouthful was rich in shroom flavors with a tinge of truffle, making it an extremely enjoyable one! \n<br />The other pasta we had was the Angus Beef Pasta ($16)! With generous amounts of beef, paired with linguine, the amount of beef jus was just right! Add some chili flakes for the additional kick, if you\'d like!
Hitting all the right notes was this mini mountain of Smokey Aglio Olio - my choice of pasta for my $12 set lunch today.\n<br />Favourite part? It\'s a toss-up between the fragrant pieces of bacon that imparted tonnes of flavour into the dish and the grilled courgettes that were done just the way I like \'em.
WTF! Pasta was done Al Dente; penne was coated with mysterious sauce that included some fruit. Comfy eggs were delicious half-boiled eggs with sausage and mushrooms in it. Prawn pesto linguine seemed best that night and I\'d want to go back to try the risotto. (P.S. They have homemade pasta too) WTF! Pasta $14, Prawn Pesto $16.
WhyTF is it called WTF? Well, Chris, chef-owner of Ah Bong\'s Italian explained that was exactly what he exclaimed when he read the recipe. But he isn\'t revealing what goes into this tasty WTF Pasta. Only two people have made correct guesses so far. And nope, I wasn\'t one of them. WTF right?! üòÇ\n<br />So, the big question is: WhoTF is going to be number 3? üòé
The distinct aroma of truffle was so addictive and flavourful that resulted in me thoroughly enjoying this dish! üçö\n<br />üôåmodel : @jellylovefats üçö\n<br />You can easily get to Ah Bong\'s Italian by taking buses 57, 100, 107, 961, 961C, 980 and alighting at Bus Stop B01621 (Opposite Shaw Towers) which is just 1 minute walk away from this delicious plate of Truffle Mushroom Risotto! üòò
A fun-gi. Yes I know that joke was an absolute banger. I\'ll be here all week. In all seriousness though, I really did enjoy ravishing this plate of risotto that\'s vegetarian friendly. Ah Bong\'s truffled mushroom risotto is loaded with chunky slices of shiitake mushrooms and some onions (I think), finished off with a healthy helping of Parmesan cheese grated atop. The arborio rice was on point, being firm enough to provide a bit of bite while being soft enough to prove its al dente status. And I have no idea how Chris managed to make the simple white wine sauce mixed in with truffle paste (that\'s right, truffles were ground into a paste before being added to this) so utterly luscious and creamy, but he did.
I\'ve always given Ah Bong\'s signature Birthday pasta a pass as there was always a newer, more exciting offering on the menu. But when my tongue made first contact with the orecchiette that was coated in that redolent roasted broccoli pesto, I regretted not giving this a go much, much earlier.
We ordered the molten eggs, consisting of 2 molten eggs topped with cheese, chorizo sausage and mushrooms.¬† Mix it all up and it\'s ooey, gooey -delicious. It complemented our pastas really well. I ordered the giant tortellini, which came with mushrooms, chestnuts and truffle. The filling was generous-earthy texture of porcini mushrooms. The sauce was yummy as well. My brother ordered the Angus meat ragu with fresh parpadella. The meat sauce was flavourful with its tomato base, and the parpadella was Al dente. My parents ordered the crabmeat aglio aglio, which consists of squidink pasta, tomato, longbean (?) and fresh crabmeat.\n<br />¬†We topped up $5 for both pastas(except tortellini) to have it be handmade pasta. Worth-it! The crab pasta was a fresh medley of seafood and greens, with a spicy kick! Overall, I enjoyed the pastas and the homey feeling Ah Bond\'s exudes.
Eyeing their homecured pancetta for the longest time, I finally got the chance to head down to Ah Bong‚Äôs at their Tan Quee Lan branch for a quick weekday lunch.
It may not look like much, and it might look like leftovers cobbled together out of hunger and desperation, but believe me when I say that this plate of pasta is the furthest thing from being a leftover dish.
One of the perks of being an Ah Bong\'s superfan is getting to try assorted items that are still in R&amp;D, such as this bowl of deep fried penne that\'s been dusted with chili flakes and sea salt. Now, as this bowl of deep fried carb overload is still in its formative stage, I won\'t really be penne-sorry, penning down much about this. However, I can guarantee that this is a real game changer for beer snacks, setting the bar real high. 
It seems like there isn\'t much Chris can\'t make in house. The main elements on this plate of purist carbonara was made from scratch, right in Ah Bong\'s kitchen. The pasta was freshly made, and the pancetta had just emerged out of its curing process. Really, I\'d be only mildly surprised if Chris came up to me one day and told me that he\'d started brewing his own beer.
The eggs taste really really special that I can\'t taste it in other shop!!! And it will make u feel comfort ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüíïüíïüíï
Had \"Atas Duck Ragu\" (no kidding that\'s what\'s on the menu). Ok I get the appeal of this place. Simple but hearty and full of flavour. üëçüèª Their second outlet took over than previous Gastrosmith.  #howtonotbefat #ahbongsitalian #burrple
Heard so so so many good reviews about this place and it did not disappoint. Oyster and pork sausage risotto ($16) polished off the entire plate in a few minutes. Oysters tasted rly fresh and overall the taste was excellent and not overly creamy.
Just a few doors down from Joo Bar, Ah Bong\'s Italian dishes out plates of delicious, freshly made pasta. Unlike its original digs in Tiong Bahru which only serves lunch, this location opens for both lunch and dinner, and its central location makes it the perfect compromise between those working in the CBD and those who are not. Moreover, all chef-owner Chris\' pastas are made with heart and will please the fussiest eater in the group. Go for the crowd-pleasing Angus Beef Ragu ($16), or if you\'re in luck, get the signature Birthday Pasta ($9) ‚Äî a winning combination of cream, bacon and broccoli that is sure to satisfy. The made-from-scratch dishes change everyday and the day‚Äôs offerings are uploaded on their Instagram every morning, great for those who need a little inspiration! Chris is experimenting more at this outlet, so show your support by trying new items and giving him your feedback!\n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim
Finally went to try this as this outlet is open during the weekends and for longer hours than the original outlet! Lovely food, good ambience, location &amp; service! For more pictures head to @justjiak on instagram
A hot bowl of Ah Bong\'s Light Tomato Soup a (rainy) day keeps the doctor away. As the name suggests, it\'s not as heavy on the palette as most other tomato soups, and in fact, could easily become a stellar gazpacho by just chilling it. 
Everything is almost the same as a traditional carbonara...except that cream is used instead of egg and butter. Now, before you cry heresy, it\'s really, really luscious and the consistency is much thicker than the standard carbonara thanks to the  cream. The addition of mushrooms and the all important bacon makes this pasta dish sensationally savory and an absolute joy to eat.
I\'ll just quietly let myself out. Before I go though, this baby right here is a thing of beauty. A gigantic gob of slightly sour and indecently creamy burrata that\'s as fresh as Will Smith was in the 90s is drizzled with olive oil and speckled with ground black pepper, while being accompanied by its posse of Ah Bong\'s fabulous fresh baked bread and their absolutely amazing slow roasted cherry tomatoes. The price for this ensemble? $14.
Possibly the only place that can make me a convert for their chickens. Soft and tender, the chicken sat gloriously on top of spring vegetables, and these vegetables were just another reason to fall in love deeper with this dish. Charred leek flowers, carrots and cherry tomatoes with bits of bacon and potatoes -- that sounds like a heap of spring indeed! The light broth was sweet and savoury, thanks to the vegetables and chicken broth. What a meal and it\'s even more complete with a few glasses of red wine. Definitely the best choice of meal after a long day of school and tuition üôà
I\'m really glad Chris\' penchant for experimenting extends past his pastas and spills over into his desserts. These 73% chocolate cake bites are 100% legit, and it\'s every bit as dank as a less-than-legal equivalent of this little rectangle of pleasure.
If there was ever a dish that would make me consider giving up the marvel that is meat, it would be this truffle cream pasta from Ah Bong\'s Italian. Ah Bong\'s characteristically al dente linguine is tossed in humble heavy cream that has been uplifted by copious amounts of fragrant truffle oil, and is then dressed resplendently with earthy shiitake mushrooms and an abundance of sweet roasted chestnuts.  I enjoyed the addition of the chestnuts that brought sweetness to the pasta, striking a pleasant balance of sweet and savory elements. It also helped to lift the flavor profile of the dish, keeping it from getting too rich and heavy. The only minor nitpick I had was that there wasn\'t nearly enough of those earthy, tasty shiitake mushrooms. Other than that, it\'s simple yet oh so sumptuous.
So GOOD!! I raved the crab taste that was paired really harmoniously with the delicate melted cheese! Best thing tho is that it was not too jelat! A true gem üíñ‚ú®üçù‚ú®üíé keep up the good work üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüòä‚ò∫Ô∏è
\nFor $12 nett, I had my choice of pasta, a soft drink and a dessert of the day (which turned out to be their much-lauded Thai Tea Creme Br√ªl√©e).\n<br />From the pastas listed on the board today, the \"Liver Ragu Penne\" was the one I zoomed in on because I adore liver, plus also because I\'ve never had pasta cooked with it before. And oh man, this was stellar. \n<br />The slow-cooked sauce was made completely from chicken and duck livers, and jazzed up with Marsala wine. What got me smiling from ear to ear were the generous chunks of creamy liver that\'s thrown in for good measure. Seriously, this dish was so, so good.
Ohman. The tastiest Aglio Oilo i ever had. The tomatoes were to die for.
Finally an outlet i can try on a weekend without rushing! Lovely dish this was the last serving that day btw. Do try it! Visit @justjiak on insta for more good food porn.
Earl Grey custard base was not bad but the layer of torched caramel seems a little over burnt? „Äã$5
At this point, it\'s probably safe to say that Ah Bong\'s cash register and my wallet are old friends. But with such perfectly palatable pasta such as this iberico carbonara at just $16, it\'s hard not to love this place.
What do you get when you cross freshly made (just made the night before me devouring this, as I learned from Chris) basil pesto, a hefty helping of mushrooms and pine nuts with amazingly al dente pasta?
Chris is being terribly modest when he calls this Italian siew yoke \'almost there pork belly\'. It IS already there in pork perfection, and it is, without a doubt, the most satisfying roast pork belly you\'ll have in a place that isn\'t a Chinese roast meat specialist.
I really wanted to love this. My previous visit to Ah Bong\'s was great hence high expectations for this Aglio Olio ($14). However the garlic flavours were muted and the small dash of peppercorns felt a little out of place. I\'d say go for the Angus Beef Ragu ($16) instead. That is the bomb !!
This is a strong contender for first place, alongside with Comfort Eggs, for the best dish at Ah Bong\'s. We LOVE the meaty flavours, al dente noodles and the oh-so-yummy beef cheek shreds. Tell me where else you can get beef cheek pasta for $16!
SO DAMN GOOD. Seriously! Fresh fluffy home-made bread paired with a seemingly odd sounding anchovy butter, which turned out to work beautifully well. The crisp crust and addictive spread is nothing like I\'ve tasted before and no wonder it was flying out of the kitchen non-stop. It\'s definitely going on my to-order list for my next visit. Can\'t wait to go back for more affordable pastas and starters!
Really good stuff, but I do miss the interesting and exciting rendition of pasta at the Tiong baru branch.
Why doesn\'t #kai_yuhao allow me to carry him üò©. Tried their Tuscan Cauliflower which I quite like with charred cauliflower, mint and dried shrimps. Strong flavours of mint and heibi which surprisingly goes well together! The comfort eggs with Mangalica sausage and mushroom w truffle oil was really comforting and delicious ‚ò∫Ô∏è #Burpple #burpplesg #pasta #sgfoods #ahbongs
Portion-wise, this is quite worth it for the price. Huge chunks of crab meat with a decent quantity of pasta for $14 is not easy to come by. However the charred leeks weren\'t great - the burnt parts were a little tough to chew and the unburnt leeks were tastier and more palatable. This has a good amount of spice - enough such that you can taste it, but not too overpowering. For an aglio olio, it\'s also not too oily. 
The linguine was cooked perfectly, and each strand was coated evenly with the sauce and pieces of tender beef cheek and pork. Quantity wise, portions of both the pasta and meat were rather generous. I would say the quality is quite good for the price. Personally, if it wasn\'t sold out, I would have preferred to try their cream-based pastas as I prefer those over their tomato-based ones. Nothing in particular that blew my mind, although I definitely would want to come back and try their other pastas since they change their menu so frequently!
Pork was tender, fats quite melt-in-your-mouth, but skin wasn\'t as crisp as I was hoping for it to be. To be honest, it was slightly disappointing because it was served slightly cold as well. I would much prefer their other starters like their eggs and fries. Also, at $12, it\'s not that worth it either for the portion and quality. I think it might be better if it was warmed up before being served.
Made with egg, this lusciously thick and creamy carbonara is chock-full of premium Iberico pork guancale and roasted mushrooms. I personally enjoyed chewing on the cubes of meat which were deeply flavourful having been cured in-house. Another big plus about this plate of pasta is its pretty affordable price tag of $16.\n
Known for serving quality food at affordable prices, we finally made our way to their TQL outlet. And are we glad we made the trip there!! Here are my takes: Fries was Fragrant &amp; Superb; you could get a whiff of that fatty seduction aroma a few cm away in fact! That\'s how my friend &amp; I knew we just had to order it!! Yuzu sorbet on the other ‚úãüèº, was sweet &amp; tangy &amp; refreshing üëÖ which to order? Of course both and then share la! Kinda obvious right üòè
The picture says it all. Flavourful &amp; plate-licking good üëÖüôäüòÇ The essence of ah bong\'s food is da sauce, peeps! No chunks of meat might be seen but with the sauce so rich, I am simply content without the chunks of meat that would otherwise be fighting for both tummy &amp; plate space! Verdict: Y u m m y üëÖ
On Ah Bong\'s secret menu tonight was their special squid ink pasta. Unlike the squid ink pastas elsewhere, Ah Bong\'s is unique as they took the standard chunky tomato based sauce and cooked it with the squid ink instead of just saut√©ing the pasta with squid ink (as is the norm). The result is a splendidly savory (more so than usual) pasta with some sublimely saut√©ed squid swimming in the sea of pasta. As with all their other pastas, this perfect plate here was so simple yet so scrumptious.
Flying Dragon Pasta ($14 nett) - brand new on the menu... Delicious &amp; so filling. Pasta was cooked perfectly, as usual.
I\'ve always thought that pasta is something that can be easily prepared at home, but this Angus Meat Ragu Pasta made of beef cheek, brisket and pork isn\'t one of them ‚Äî the generous amount of well braised and tender meat tossed in meat sauce just won me over. 
The moment this passed my lips I was immediately reminded of my mum\'s pesto(which is the best in the world). Painstakingly housemade basil pesto that hits all the right levels and notes of herbaceousness, cheesy nuttiness and silky olive oil flavour, clinging on fervently to each length of linguine. Toss in pine nuts, bits of mushroom and grated cheese into the mix and you\'ve got a deceptively simple, earthy bowl of pasta that eats like it was twice the sum of its parts. \n<br />#BurppleBestBugis #BurppleBugisUnder15
I am so glad that they have finally opened a second outlet in the East because I can finally get my stomach to this Angus Meat Ragu ($16) conveniently. Comes with plentiful of that angus beef cheek, brisket and pork, this is definitely value-for-money. No frills or weird \"fusionology\", Ah Bong\'s Italian serves an honest plate of good quality pasta.
Ah Bong\'s is synonymous with unpretentious, home cooked Italian fare that\'s easy on the wallet but doesn\'t skimp on taste nor quality.
Who knew that the world was as small as the floor area of Ah Bong\'s Italian? Not only did I discover that one of my old army buddies is a chef at Ah Bong\'s, but I ran into @veronicaphua as well! Since there were two Tastemakers (read: food fanatics) in the house, Chris very generously decided to show us a tease of darn delicious things to come soon. VERY soon.
Addicted? Maybe! üòÜ I was back at Ah Bong\'s Italian yesterday and had the healthy Dou Miao Aglio Olio this time. I liked that the lightly saut√©ed vegetables added some crunchiness to the slippery smooth linguine and sweet, juicy, softened baby tomatoes.\n<br />The bonus was bumping into fellow Burpple Tastemaker Russell and his dad who were there for the first time ever. Quite naturally, a lively conversation about food ensued.
While not as cheesy or saucy as I expected it to be, it\'s still ridiculously rich. The lush, thick b√©chamel clung onto every piece of penne and was stunningly savory and silky smooth from start to finish. And for just $13, the amount of actual tender, tasty crabmeat in the dish puts many other establishments that charge a whole lot more to utter shame. It\'s amazingly appetizing, and it\'s definitely worth every penny of its very affordable price.
Ah Bong\'s Italian really undersold this dish when they called this dish comfort eggs. A pair of perfectly poached eggs that are sous vide to superstardom for ten minutes at *INFORMATION REDACTED* to achieve maximum eggporn ratings, as I learned from my friend Daryl.
Heard so much about this place and I finally had the chance to try it out yesterday!! Was really excited but unfortunately....where\'s the crab meat in my linguine??!! Kind of disappointed by the rather measly portion of meat inside (my friend\'s plate on the other hand, had a more generous portion. Inconsistent?) The pasta had a great texture and flavour was good though! Probably will give this place another shot (the pastas are very reasonably priced!) and the famous birthday pasta wasn\'t on the menu that day, but I guess that gives me a good reason to return. 
Located a few doors down from Joo Bar along Tan Quee Lan Street is Ah Bong\'s Italian second outlet. Unlike its original digs in Tiong Bahru which only serves lunch, this location opens for both lunch and dinner! Chef-owner Chris is experimenting more in here, so show your support by trying new items and giving him your feedback. Note that the menu changes daily (the day\'s offerings are uploaded on their Instagram every morning). If you\'re in luck, order the Caramel Corn ($10), a surprisingly delicious salty-sweet concoction of black pig bacon, sweet caramelised corn and chili flakes. The signature Birthday Pasta ($9), a winning combination of cream, bacon and broccoli, always satisfies. If you\'re coming in a group, try the Comfort Eggs ($8) to start‚Äî two wobbly eggs served with truffle oil and sausages. Should it be available, have the Thai Tea Creme Brulee ($5). Don\'t be deceived by its petite serving ‚Äî it packs a punch of flavour! \n<br />Avg price: $15 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Raine Liu
Scurried over like those painted chickens on the plate the moment I saw the Fresh Pesto pasta was available last Friday (the menu changes every day depending on what the chef-owner feels like cooking, best to track it by checking their Facebook or Instagram accounts). Having heard good things about it from a few people, I was eager to give it a go and with the second Ah Bong\'s Italian located close to my office, I could do that easily.

The chilled, crisp butterhead leaves came prettily arranged in a bowl along with a few small, soft pickled tomatoes. Completing the summery look and feel of this simple salad was the housemade orange mustard dressing. Seriously, at only $5, how could I not order this to start? Had it all to myself as well. 
Caramel Corn - comforting mix of fresh corn, black pig bacon and chili. Love it how flavourful it is with just a few simple ingredients while the slight heat made it so easy to finish. Such a hearty filling lunch for just $10 NETT (!!) üòª Guess I\'ll be real back soon!
Beautifully slow roasted, these tomatoes burst with sweetness. Pairs wonderfully with the tangy, deep balsamic reduction and the fragrant basil, finished with Parmesan. Good starter to share!
Really good pastas and meatballs. I like it that the ingredients are fresh and generous. Prices are affordable and it\'s still a hidden haunt because it\'s not crowded. I also think the constantly changing menu adds a refreshing twist to visiting regulars. 
I\'ve tried (and liked) quite a few of their pastas, but this is one, tops them all. The meltingly tender French duck confit was the star of the show, shining through the ragu sauce and enveloping the Parmesan-dotted pasta with its robust flavours. Highly comforting and deeply satisfying yet not heavy/greasy at all; a must-have at Ah Bong\'s. P.S. The portion is actually more generous than it looks.
There\'s something so visually arresting about this jet black pool of briny goodness. Simmered with white wine, the creamy sauce coated and clung onto springy linguine strands generously strewn with fresh squid and a light dusting of chilli flakes. Very satisfying, and as good as it can get at this price point. 
Comfort Eggs ($8) done with the runny center and the undeniable taste of truffle, lives up to it\'s name. Part of the sharing menu, the restaurant also offers a pasta heavy menu of mains. Great no frills dining experience.
This large portion of pasta was cooked a tad softer than al dente with a generous splash of seafood-y stock. Tossed together in it was an ample amount of fresh crabmeat, roasted garlic, crunchy grilled leeks and soft-cooked whole baby tomatoes. I am not shy to admit I was grunting in pleasure while eating.
I can never say no to \"sio bak\". Which is why the moment I clapped eyes on the \"Almost There\" Pork Belly scribbled on the menu board at Ah Bong\'s Italian\'s second outlet, I had to make it mine. Crunchy of skin, juicy of meat and shiok-ly salty, it was thoughtfully accompanied by refreshing Korean-style pickled cucumber and chives. 
Soft wobbly eggs, the scent of truffle and savory sausages and mushrooms creates this delightfully simple dish. üç≥ \n<br />We loved the simplicity of this which went so well with all the other dishes at Ah Bong\'s Italian. Really an aptly named dish that made me want to keep digging in for more. üòäüòäüòä
So glad to have this umami party as my first plate at their new outlet ‚Äî I only managed to catch this roasted broccoli pesto pasta studded with black pig bacon once before. üéâ üéâ
Hello from Ah Bong\'s new outlet at Tan Quee Lan (Bugis)! 
Hello from Ah Bong\'s new outlet at Tan Quee Lan (Bugis)! The signature plates are here to stay üéâ
Birthday Pasta on Ah Bong\'s signature plates ($9 nett) - Linguine with slow-roasted broccoli pesto, bacon, chilli üå∂
It\'s been 1.5 years of me patronising @ahbongsitalian and I\'m really glad to see how it has grown, with so many new dishes that I haven\'t had time (and tummy space) to try. The new cosy place (with air con!) welcomes customers with the same warmth and familiarity as the Tiong Bahru outlet. Operating for both lunch and dinner, now they also serve starters (psst, do try their amazingly good crackling pork!), coffee and desserts. But after all, my comfort food is still their pasta üòå
It comes with broccoli, fresh basil and home-cured bacon, which is a testament of their commitment to create authentic, wholesome dishes at pocket-friendly prices for the masses.\n<br />-\n<br />Do also check out the variety of sides available here such as crab cakes and charred beef short ribs.\n<br />-\n<br />==========\n<br />üìçAh Bong‚Äôs Italian\n<br />#01-02, 103 Beach Road\n<br />(Below Marrison Hotel)\n<br />(S) 189704\n<br />==========\n<br />Thank you @ahbongsitalian for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for the invite.\n<br />-\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#italian #italiano #italianfood #pasta #beef #whati8today #foodsg #sgfood #instasg  #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #cafehoppingsg #yoursingapore #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats

-\n<br />Ah Bong‚Äôs Italian is a humble, non-pretentious cafe that serves tasteful pasta, including their very housemase pasta.\n<br />We tried a few, and this [Angus, $16 or $21 for homemade pasta] pictured goodness comes with meat ragu, beef cheek and duroc pork. Each bite is inviting, with well-simmered meat. Thumbs uuuuuppp!\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @ahbongsitalian for hosting us and @justinfoodprints for the invite.\n<br />- ==========\n<br />üìçAh Bong‚Äôs Italian\n<br />#01-02, 103 Beach Road\n<br />(Below Marrison Hotel)\n<br />(S) 189704\n<br />==========\n<br />-\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#italian #italiano #italianfood #pasta #beef #whati8today #foodsg #sgfood #instasg  #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #cafehoppingsg #yoursingapore #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats

I decided to go with the Pork Pomodoro Penne since the pesto truffle based pasta was sold out. I dived right into my meal once the food arrived since I was starving! \n<br />The texture of the penne was al dante, the pasta sauce tasted really watered down. The only saving grace was the pork belly which tasted really fragrant though I would have preferred the skin being crunchy like \"siew yok\". Overall, I think u can pop-by this place for an afternoon coffee with your friends or maybe a beer since they have happy hour prices at $8/bottle. Other than that, I\'m not going back for their food. #throwback #cafehopping #italian #penne #pasta #pork #burpple #food #lunch #sgcafes #sgcafehopping #sgeats #littedupeats #food #tomatobased

üòå \n<br />Happy Father\'s Day, Chris! Thanks for seeing me through my university kid life to this stressed up working adult.
freshly made pasta! üòãüòã
Average...
Just look at that creaminess! My favourite kinda of cheese and we were told these had just arrived from Italy. Utterly delicious! I could eat plates of these! Came with crusty homemade bread, drenched in yummilicious olive oil &amp; a side of cherry tomatoes.
The dish was hearty and flavorful, and made me feel true comfort as per its name\n<br />üìç@ahbongsitalian, #01-02, 103 Beach Road, S189704 (near Bugis mrt, exit towards Tan Quee Lan)
Super stoked to have my hands finally on this! Burrata was oozy and creamy... basically any cheese lover\'s dream. Spread it on the perfectly toasted homemade (emphasis on this, because I\'m impressed at that dedication), and paired with the tomatoes. A delightful way to whet the appetite or curb hunger pangs before the mains arrive.
Really really meaty and satisfying pasta for 6$ add on during lunch(set). The chef said the pasta is just cooked in its own meat juice lol no wonder so much umami. And the grated cheese just absolutely seals the deal
Todays dessert was of the day was brownies! Loved everything about it except the size haha. But guess it worked because might be hard to finish since its so rich, and the pasta was filling.
At 2$ top up for the lunch set(12 for main, drink and dessert of the day), this was incredibly refreshing lol. Both the orange thyme and seasalt lemonade was so unimaginably good, but the orange thyme really takes it up a notch with the orange zest
Crabby Aglio Olio ($16 or $21 nett)
The dish is well-portioned and so damn tasty, I often end up with a sparkling clean plate. #thisCuriousCraving #epicuration #burpple #ahbongsitalian
The cream is just right as it\'s not overpowering and not too subtle. This prawns although looks like fillers does actually enhance the overrall flavor giving a slight seafood type of taste.. what I love about this is that it comes with plenty of veges like zucchini and long bean so at least you can \'tick\' on the \'vegetables for the day\' column!üòõ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#ahbongsitalian#italianfood#prawnpasta#pasta#prawn#creampasta#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Love this! Everything was on point.. was surprised that they chose linguine as the pasta, but in no way, that affected the taste.. it was al dente, tasty, garlicky in a good way, and all around delicious top with shredded crab meat, cherry tomatoes and some vege.. love it! If I have one comment would be maybe the lack of chili.. but it\'s ok! I still love it!üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩ\n<br />Oh btw, love the traditional rooster plate too!üòõ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#ahbongsitalian#italianfood#alioolio#pasta#crab#crabpasta#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Im back again
Cheesy, creamy, thick and best of all.. comes with real crab meat! Generally I would prefer linguine, but seems like they didn\'t have the option for it üòû, either way it\'s a good pasta but at $12,( probably due to the real crab meat) I would consider the lesser priced items when I\'m back here..\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#ahbongsitalian#italianfood#macandcheese#pasta#crab#crabpasta#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

Pretty much justifies the hype they are generating. The ragu though already succulent and tantalizing by itself is still outshone by its more illustrious neighbour
As usual, owner-chef Chris pulls it off with an impressive simplicity that he\'s known for. Appreciate the friendly service, and fuss-free dining experience.

Was reading some good reviews about this place and decided to give it a try.. The menu changes everyday so try your luck :) I\'m a sucker for angus..so wasn\'t too difficult to make my decision :)...the beef was flavorful and tender but I do think the cheese is rather overwhelming.. Will not be back for this but dont mind trying the other stuffs :) Overall, 3/5... #burpple #ahbong #italian #lunchwithfel #bugiseats #jingxinleftme
Comfort Eggs ($8 nett) - sausage is on the salty side, but the half boiled egg + sausage + mushroom combination is overall pretty great.
Enjoyed the spicy kick! Super value for money. 
My only gripe is the lack of sauce.
Linguine, Charred Leeks, Chilli Pesto &amp; Black Pig Bacon „Äã$9
Penne, Crab Meat, Mushroom, Cheese Sauce „Äã$13
„Äã$8
Some catch time with the ladies.
So I walked to Ah Bong .... in the cool‚òî rain with high anticipation.\n<br />üåÇüíß\n<br />There was no meaty pastaüò¢on the menu only meatballs as starters. Then a glimmer of hope. I had to ask. Yes...ask and you shall receive. The owner/chef gladly prepared this tomato based meatballs pasta with generous shavings of cheese. Chris said if only the meat was abit fattier.. it will be tastier and I said if it was alittle less salty.. If u could see me glee with joyüòÜ! Cravings satisfied.\n<br />üçùüçù\n<br />Thank you Chris @ahbongsitalian for specially preparing the pasta dish and spending time to talk to me. Shout out to Sam @ahbongsitalian for the chitchat and warm hospitality. \n<br />#pastas #lunch #i8mondays #8dayseat #hungrygowhere #burpplesg #burpple #opensnap #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #igers #sgig #instafoodsg #instafollow #tripadvisor #narratrs #townske_official #singaporeinsiders
