Finally found a place that serves authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the East. Located at Grandlink Square along Guillemard Road, Little Vietnam is a small eatery that serves Vietnamese fare at an affordable cost and opens till 1am from Tuesdays to Sundays. Definitely a hidden gem! What I had today is the grilled lemongrass chicken with fresh vegetables and rice vermicelli, also known as Bun Ga Nuong Xa.
Nice coffee with speedy service. A nice relaxing place at outdoor. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Located on the first level of an old building, this slightly cramped restaurant serves up super authentic, very affordable and absolutely delicious Vietnamese fare. From freshly made spring rolls to cockles with tamarind sauce to the usual beef ph√≥ to juicy grilled prawns and fried quail? And a ton more dishes to choose from? And authentic desserts (think banana with sago and warm coconut cream)? I could go on and on how tasty the food were. Be prepared to queue during mealtimes.

üç§Grilled prawns\n<br />A must have whenever i\'m here, even the outer layer of the shell taste so good (*i did not eat the shell)  the prawn is tender and it\'s best to dip it with the given sauce. -\n<br />üçó Grilled chicken with rice\n<br />The chicken is well marinated, it\'s soft, tender and had a grilling flavour. -\n<br />üêÑBeef combination\n<br />The beef is tender and the soup is very flavourful which isn\'t too beefy. -\n<br />#instafood #insta_food #food #sgfood #sgfoods #foods #yummy #hungry #foodism #foodgram #foodgasm #foodfie #foodspam #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodstagram #foodspotting #sgfoodspotting #foodshare #sgfoodshare #foodpics \n<br />#sgfoodpics #foodie #foodlover #8dayseat #burpple #dinner #vietnamfood
Taste authentic and priced at $6.
A lil sad cause their grilled prawns are sold out üòü Anyway i ordered grilled lemongrass chicken with egg.\n<br />The chicken itself is well marinated and tender with the fragance of the grilled. Dip it with the sauce which is slightly sweet and salty which will enhance ur appetitie. 9.5/10 \n<br />#instafood #insta_food #food #sgfood #sgfoods #foods #yummy #hungry #foodism #foodgram #foodgasm #foodfie #foodspam #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodstagram #foodspotting #sgfoodspotting #foodshare #sgfoodshare #foodpics \n<br />#sgfoodpics #foodie #foodlover #8dayseat #burpple #dinner #vietnamfood

Been wanting to try this #vietnamese cafe for a while - was told it\'s good and it was. Serves fast, the spring rolls and pho were pretty tasty. But never as good as @viesentimentale\'s pho imho! \n<br />#dinner #vietnamesefood #pho #springrolls #yummy #beef #foodinsg #foodies #cafesg #sgfoodies #sgfood #singapore #hungry #burpple

They serve delicious and affordable vietnam food. Highly recommanded is their cockle stir fried (come with garlic flavour or spicy &amp; sour), also try their beef pasta its yummy, for something light can try their beef rice noodle soup, for drinks must must try their passion fruit smoothie! After sunset, the outdoor becomes cooling its a nice feeling to sit outdoor. 2 persons estimated budget abt $30 or less to eat here.
