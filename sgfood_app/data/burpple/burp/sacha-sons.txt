It seems that Sacha &amp; Sons now offer two different types of bagel now; a pumpkin seed one and the sesame seed bagel that we were used to seeing. There is no doubt that their Bagel is still as delicious as it was; savoury smoked salmon slices, luscious and thick cream cheese and capers that burst off savoury, pickled flavours. If only the bagel itself was served a little more warm, and less dense it would have been perfect.
Chanced upon this while deciding a place to brunch at Mandarin Gallery. I loved their bagels and latkes so much. It\'s so difficult to find delicious bagels in Singapore and by far, this is one of the best. I could totally just have that and cream cheese for brunch. The latkes was a surprising winner too. Wasn\'t too sure what did I order, but it was so delicious with the hollandaise sauce. 
Freshly baked bagel that is boiled first before baking. The sesame topping gives a crunchy texture and flavorful aroma. Best eaten with cream cheese
The friends enjoyed the bagel and eggs very much. Food was warm though; would be better served piping hot! 
The smoked pastrami was slightly salty alone but paired together with the latkes (potato and onion pancakes) and Hollandaise, yum! Pity the latkes were cold, better if they were to be served piping hot!
Had quite forgotten how humongous the portions here are ‚Äì I barely managed to finish half the scrambled eggs (although I did polish off the bagel and herb cream cheese cleanly). The knishes here are a must-order; each parcel of puff pastry is swollen with mashed potato and peppery pastrami. And the latkes this time were better-cooked and crispier around the edges than I remember them to be when I first dined here last December.
Not a fan of the greasy and chewy latke (fried potato and onion pancakes) but the gravlax with creme fraiche was topped with chives and made for an absolutely delicious breakfast.
There has been much ado on social media about Jewish-style delis highlighting fragrant fresh bagels and incredible pastrami. Sacha &amp; Sons fills a gaping hole in the Singapore food scene and serves phenomenal, fluffy, delicious sesame-covered bagels (the intimate interior is filled with the same heady scent of fresh bread) and warm and herby pastrami. I ordered the grilled Reuben sandwich (you have a choice between rye bread, bagels and brioche), which was a bagel stuffed with melted swiss cheese, tangy sauerkraut, \"Russian dressing\" AND piles of pastrami. Delicious.
üóΩ I wish... But this is as good as it gets in Singapore!! #sachandsons #chopesg #burpple
If what you\'re after is the taste of a classic Jewish deli, Sacha &amp; Sons is the place to be. Start your day right with their Latkes (potato and onion pancakes) with Gravlax and Creme Fraiche ($16), it is everything you\'d want for brunch. Share a plate of their delightful Pastrami Knishes ($12) ‚Äî three warm, buttery puff pastry rolls stuffed with pastrami and potatoes, served with a black pepper pastrami sauce. Craving for bagels? Choose from their Eggs with Toasted Bagels selection. For another classic, go for the Grilled Rueben Sandwich ($18), the combination of corned beef with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing is sublime. The prices here are slightly on the steep side, but you do get what you pay for!
Generously packed sandwich, pastrami was just moist and flavorful. Rye bread was crisply toasted, pity it got soggy due to the watery pickle beside it. Sauerkraut inside was good! Beetroot soup had plenty of sour cream, viscosity was pleasant, but quite forgettable. Get the salmon/trout salad instead! Well balanced flavors, not too salty.
üòâ Layers and layers of grilled pastrami with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing with salad &amp; pickles as sides. #sachaandsons
A rare find in Singapore are the Jewish-style bagels (from $8) made with unleavened bread. It‚Äôs chewier than the New York style bagels that we‚Äôre accustomed to, but not to say that different is bad. Our personal pick: bagel with gravlax, herbed cream cheese, onion and capers ($16). Just look at how generous they are with the layers of thick slices of chunky salmon! Our only gripe is the lack of Munster cheese, and perhaps a sunny side up egg? (It‚Äôs a New Yorker thing.)
Finally here after only reading about how good  this place is on burpple and I have to say it matched up to all the anticipation and expectation! My friends and I had a great time with the patient and helpful staff, and most importantly the great food! Enjoyed everything we ordered and I loved my freshly baked bagel with smoked salmon that\'s came like a paste but still harbored the salmon taste and complimented the bagel well! Can\'t wait for my next trip here to try their sweets  
If rich hearty\' your thing, New York style delicatessen Sacha &amp; Sons is the place to be. I\'ve got crispy latkes with sour cream and apple sauce, sweet matzo brei with house-made strawberry jam, meat platter of a variety of house-cured beef, pickles and slaw, and one of my favorites; chopped liver with sauerkraut! That\'s not all though, there\'s still bagel with gravlax, grilled reuben with pastrami and Swiss cheese... Yummy! Stay tuned to our review on GourmetAdventures.net!
Gravlax (cured salmon) and creme fraiche latke (potato and onion pancake).\n<br />It was not too bad, but a little disappointing as it wasn\'t hot. Expected the pancake to come out freshly cooked but it seemed like it had been pre-cooked and sitting there for a while.
I have a thing for the Grilled Reuben sandwiches here. When pastrami, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing get together, there ain\'t stoppin\' that flavour express! This time though, I chose to have all of that between pieces of brioche instead of classic rye. I have to say, the thick but light and soft brioche was an amazing match for the flavourful filling.
You can find a small selection of homemade sodas on the menu here. This Black Cherry Soda was fine but not exactly worthy of wow\'s. I did like that it wasn\'t overly sweet though. I guess if I was after a cold non-coffee beverage, it would do. Beats a soft drink any time.\n
back here again! tried different things and everything has been great :-)
I just can\'t get enuf, I just can\'t get enuf!
taking over the previous premises of wild honey (which opened right beside it in a bigger space), cosy interior and free postcards (bottom right)! beef sandwich &amp; a half-half (corned beef reuben and borsch) pictured here, all yummy :-)
If you like chicken liver, you\'ll be pleased to know that Sacha &amp; Sons is tremendously generous with theirs ‚Äì each open-faced sandwich is accompanied by hardboiled egg and pickles. But if you love chicken skin like me, opt for Sacha\'s Toast, which comes littered with crispy nibblets made of just that.
One of it is the smoked salmon w creme fraiche &amp; the another one is pastrami &amp; hollandaise sauce
Slice into halves, cover any exposed surface with at least 1cm of cream cheese for good measure. Review of Sacha &amp; Sons up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com link in bio! U know you wanna sink your teeth into these babies. 1 word- GO!
A taste of New York üóΩ I can\'t emphasize how much I love the trout dip. It\'s perfect with the warmly toasted bagels:) and oh oh, not forgetting the their pickles, ooomphhhh, help to open up your appetite to fit in more food! üòã
Along with house pickles and coleslaw, our platter came with Smoked Salmon, Smoked Trout Dip, and Smoked Salmon Dip.
Not the best but good enough to end our meal on a sweet note.
I like the chicken skin. They should sell the chicken skin as a side dish. Imagine a bowl of deep-fried, crunchy chicken skin &amp; a pint of beer. Perfect! üêîüç∫
Responsible for eliciting gasps of happiness from me were these three NYC delicatessen-style delights that graced our table at the recent BurppleTastemakers meet-up.\n<br />Top pic: \"Sasha\'s Toast\" is a thin slice of dark bread topped with rendered chicken fat (a.k.a. Schmaltz), fresh green herbs, translucent pink slices of baby radish and the most fabulous crispy bits of chicken skin.\n<br />Bottom left: \"Chopped Liver\" may not exactly excite everyone from the get-go but even if you aren\'t a liver fan, do give this classic deli specialty a try. The one here is exceedingly smooth and creamy with a fragrant peppery taste. Adding extra dimensions of flavour and texture are a hard-boiled egg and chopped pickles.\n<br />Bottom right: \"Knishes\" may be tricky to pronounce but they sure slip down my throat with the greatest of ease. Each roll of buttery puff pastry is stuffed with juicy pastrami and is awesome enough to make me grin with greed. But no, a mini jug of gravy swimming with tiny cubes of pastrami decides to tag along. It\'s enough to reduce grown men and this grown woman to tears (of joy).
These tower of bagels were accompanied by meat platter (pastrami, roast beef, corned beef) and smoked fish platter with smoked trout dip, smoked salmon and smoked salmon dip. üç¥ They sure look like donuts üôä
Didn\'t try this but this was @rachelxie\'s fave. The happiness on her face as she sank her teeth into the flaky, buttery puff pastry. Priceless.
$55 includes Smoked Trout Dip, Smoked Salmon Dip and Smoked Salmon with Pickles, Coleslaw, Tomatoes, Onions and of course Bagels!!! The Smoked Trout was my favourite dip, with a little texture. The Smoked Salmon Dip is great for anyone who loves a smooth buttery texture as it\'s mixed with cream cheese.
As usual, cameras eat first. Lots of photo taking, fun &amp; laughter over bagels, pastrami, smoked trout &amp; salmon.
Sadly my tastebuds wasn\'t working too well with the flu ongoing. Nevertheless, it\'s was another enjoyable night! Thanks @burpple for this eatup again! Will fulfil our pink &amp; blue post it! #burpple
Bagels accompanied by Meat Platter that comprises of Pastrami, Corned Beef and Roast Beef; and Fish/ Dips Platter of Smoked Trout Dip, Smoked Salmon Dip and Smoked Salmon.  
..... or a Specialty Platter of Smoked Fish that comes with salmon, trout and more salmon! #BurppleTastemakers
.... a Specialty Platter of Meat consisting of pastrami, meatloaf and more beef!
Two #burpple events at night straight in a row and tonight\'s eatup was awesome company at a NY-style Deli at Mandarin Gallery. Highlight of the night was when the Bagels were presented and the meat and fish platters came! Feeling so stuffed now but so worth it. Looking forward to join the next #burppletastemakers eatup!
The good people at Sacha &amp; Sons made us OD on their insanely yummy pastrami ‚Äì I am not complaining.
Essentially murdered chicken meets whipped cream (with egg, in manner of salt rub to wound). You wonder how many poor cluckers were required to produce this much liver goodness. 3.75/5
üòã Taking food photos without being judged.
These American cheese cake definitely serve the rights for desserts. It turns out to be really light and definitely not too cheesy as you think. 
Bagel with fish and meat platter. Thanks @burpple for the invite! \n<br />#FOODART #singapore #local #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #julsmakan #jiakholiao #eat #foodporn #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodsg #instafoodsg #igsg #vsco #vscocam #sgfood #sachaandsons
Smile! It\'s Jayne and Her Meat Platter
The item all of us were waiting for; Sacha &amp; Sons serve some really mean toasted bagels! Crisp with sesame seeds sprinkled, we had the free will to pair it up with all the different meats that came with it such as Smoked Salmon, Hot Salmon, Cured Trout, Corned Beef, Roasted Beef and Pastrami. My favourite has to be the Pastrami and the Trout. Corned Beef was a tad too gamey for me, while the Hot Salmon had a pretty interesting creamy consistency.
These pretty much sums up our night. Bagel with fish and meat platter. Thanks @burpple for the invite! 
These bagels are making me thirsty!
There\'s no longer a need to endure leg-cramping flights to New York to get your hands on authentic NYC deli-style cuisine. You can now take a bite of the food that\'s synonymous with the Big Apple right here in Orchard Road. \"Sasha &amp; Sons\", located on level three of the Mandarin Gallery, is where you can dig into platters piled with a variety of smoked meats and smoked fish, plus all the necessary condiments.\n<br />At the recent Burpple Tastemakers\' Eat-up, meat-loving me was more than happy to chomp on thick slices of Roast Beef, Smoked Pastrami and Corned Beef. I swear there\'s no protein with greater depth and complexity of flavour than smoked meats. After learning how the owners spent years creating and perfecting the recipe and curing process for their meats, I was even more appreciative of every bite. With the accompanying house pickles, coleslaw, sliced onions and sweet tomatoes slapped on, tastiness level went up another couple of notches.\n<br />Proving just as delectable was the fish platter that consisted of smoked salmon slices, plus dips of smoked salmon and smoked trout. The former dip was really smooth thanks to cream cheese being in its mix but I have to admit, I gravitated towards the latter. My fondness for raw onion\'s lively crunch and punch knows no bounds. \n<br />Contributing the carb factor was a mini mountain of toasted sesame seed bagels. Besides being irresistible to play with (Tastemakers, you know who you are!), these were well balanced in texture and not overly chewy.
This would be what I can eat the whole week, every single day of the week. Love the warm sesame bagels (must eat them warm - Tastemakers can wait, bagels cannot), the smoked salmon is incredibly fresh (Scottish?) and the salmon &amp; trout dips are awesome x 1000. They are so good you\'d almost forgotten about the sour cream, onions and tomatoes (that\'s the stuff that makes this a balanced diet, yes ni!) The gherkins, what can I say. They taste better than fruits, pickled ones that is. Slaw can wait (still good but someone\'s gonna take the last spot)
American version of Char Siew So ÂèâÁáíÈÖ•
Schmaltz, Herbs, Chicken Skin
Sachs Toast will be one of the wisest choice as starters, calling out your name for those crispy bits of chicken skin!
This was the best starter IMO; buttery crust that encased potatoes and pastrami with more pastrami soaked in black pepper sauce at the side. It\'s like eating a small shepherd pie somehow, though I would honestly liked it better if the beef in the fillings wasn\'t overwhelm by the potatoes.
Something but yet filling? This can be one of the best choice to have at Sacha &amp; Sons. 
A knish /Ààkn…™ É/ or knysh is an Eastern European[1] snack food consisting of a filling covered with dough that is either baked, grilled, or deep fried. In the most East European traditional versions, the filling is made entirely of mashed potato, ground meat, sauerkraut, onions, kasha (buckwheat groats), or cheese. Other varieties of fillings include sweet potatoes, black beans, fruit, broccoli, tofu, or spinach.  There you go the complete answer, for your inquisitive, answer seeking, theoretical, can\'t stop asking mind. Just eat it!
Fried chicken skin and fats atop toast with some greens. While the fats and skin seemed to resemble pork lard the dish seemed to lack something to bring all the different elements together.
Buttery, slightly tangy toast with the odd crispy thingamajig to shake up your teeth gears. 3.5/5
What a delightful crostini with herbs - Italian parsley, onion, schmaltz and fried chicken skin. Love their tangy dressing (lemon juice) which brings the whole toast delightfully weightless, almost.
Napkins on, knifes &amp; fork, smile and the Soup Nazi serves!
Chopped liver on toasted brioche? üò≥ a reminder to self: try it with an open heart as it may not appeal to everyone\'s liking. But this definitely recommended for liver lovers üòè
OMG, for me she is the winner of the night. Chef Guy explained that the chicken liver is marinated in port to give it the nice warm tone and taste. The sauerkraut, sliced boiled egg and chopped gherkin tops it off like a little celebrity for the night! Wink Wink üòò Hey, what am I? Chopped liver?
First attempt on innards on animal and honestly it\'s not my thing. But those who apparently had liver before said that it did not smell too much. Caramalised onions were delish though, and the bread could probably do with a bit of toasting perhaps?
This is a not an actual portion (tasting) of the soup, and it is actually served with bagel.
Did someone just say the meatball is made of paper??? That explains it.
Matzo ball soup and beet root borsch. Beet root wins first round.
First two dishes that appeared on the table were soups; Beetroot Borsch started off the day well with its Burpple Pink colours. A light-tasting soup with just a hint of Beetroot flavour with a texture similar to oats, with dill and sour cream atop.
Chicken Meatball in Clear Chicken Soup. Not a fan of the meatballs which seemed a tad too smooth, and tasted kinda doughy?
Thought the cheesecake would be too heavy after a very filling dinner. But I was wrong, the cheesecake was actually very light and yummy! Can\'t resist it after you start.. 
Meat platter, fish platter &amp; bagels. Ultimate bliss ‚ò∫Ô∏è Got to say I prefer the fish platter over the meat platter. Absolutely love the trout dip though most people preferred the salmon dip. Somehow the salmon dip tasted more like tuna mayo to me? The bagels were great! Well toasted and encrusted with lots of sesame seeds. Was an awesome burpple eatup :D lots of food, laughter and fun
Close-up on my share of the puff pastry roll. Mmmmm...
Another hot favourite amongst us. So easy to overdose on these... that meat gravy really packs a punch!
Some Toasted Brioche with chopped chicken liver as starters. This was creamy and rich with generous toppings, I\'m just not a big fan of liver üòÅ
see next pic.
Doesn\'t this remind you of Turkish meat skewers? Enjoyed its dense but not too chewy texture.
Sesame-coated Bagel + Smoked Salmon + Smoked Salmon Dip + Smoked Trout Dip, paired with house pickles and coleslaw. Great party food that actually tastes yummy! My personal fav for tonight\'s Burpple Tastemaker Eatup, will return for this üíï
Always a joy. The bagels + specialty platters are sooooo delightful, brilliant mix of flavours and textures. Great party food.
The added tang of lemon zest gives it a nice freshness without necessarily tasting lemony.
A medley of meats, fishes and dips. The meat platter consists of pastrami, corn beef, roast beef, meatloaf and chopped liver. The smoked fish platter consists of smoked salmon, house cured gravlax, smoked salmon dip, smoked trout dip, egg and onion. All platters comes with bagels, house pickles, coleslaw, onions and tomatoes. 
Kickstarting our meal with Sacha\'s toast, and toasted brioche with chopped liver.
Very excited for my second visit to Sacha &amp; Sons. Tender delicious roast beef, crunchy pickle and perfectly balanced coleslaw make this one of the best lunches I\'ve had in Singapore. The light and refreshing cucumber dill salad was a surprise that will definitely be on my favorites list from now on. If you are on Orchard be sure to stop by and check it out! (I also had a taste of the chopped liver, let\'s just say I can\'t wait to come back and have that as my meal!)
Enjoying a little scramble brunch with chunky flakes of smoked salmon and freshly toasted traditional bagel, plus a well executed corned beef and pastrami hash with a sunny side up. Love the smoky flavor profile of the pastrami and corn beef which might just be the best on the island, we certainly will stop by Sacha and Sons again.
This dinner set for 2 @ $58++ comes with pickles, salads, and you choose 3 meats (e.g meatloaf, fish, beef). Portions were generous, I had to packed some leftovers home. I suggest you go for their alr carte menu, seems more value for money and you wouldn\'t leave the place with a bulging tummy. 
House-smoked salmon layered with crispy potato onion pancakes and topped with a dollop of sour cream. Simple and yummy Jewish fare. Another traditional, sweet-savoury alternative (with apple sauce dip in place of salmon) is also offered here.
Jewish potato cakes (kinda like rosti) interlaced with shreds of onion and stacked in alternate layers with salmon gravlax. Om nom nom...
What a perfect brunch-y dish with moist, fluffy eggs scrambled with cubes of beef. The cream cheese flecked with dill was utterly delicious as well, a great accompaniment smeared on the bagel lavishly studded with fragrant black and white sesame seeds. 
Just about ready to head out for a belated birthday dinner, but before that, here\'s a throwback to my Christmas Eve/anniversary lunch with the significant other: a Reuben featuring some pretty dope pastrami, sauerkraut and Russian dressing between rye. If you don\'t fancy hard bread, you can have brioche or a bagel instead; pastrami can be substituted with corned beef. 
1st anniversary lunch with the boyfriend before embarking on some last-minute Christmas shopping. Orchard Road is so crowded!!! 
Service was so damn good! Guy (his name) was so friendly and gave us a very homly feel! He came over to the table to offer us an introduction to the specialties of the cafe and what\'s good! He also took the initiative to chat up w many customers while they made their orders!    The Reuben pastrami was very well done and nicely combined with some sourish onion thing in the rye which made it really nice and tangy. The salmon onion pancakes were really yummy too! Something you can choose if you\'re less hungry. Both items are superb!! Prices are inclusive GST which makes each item less than $20. Super worth it for somewhere in town, nice quaint, not too crowded (yet) and awesome service. Definitely coming back!
Oh my goodness, this was amazeballs! While gorging on that golden ratio of pastrami, saurkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing tucked between slices of rye bread, I hate to admit it but moans of pleasure did emit from yours truly. There was too much flavour going on for me to control myself. And this was just for the regular sized one. Can you imagine if I succumb to the larger portions?! üò±
This may look simple but it\'s still loaded with deliciousness. And I thought the creamy, well-seasoned chopped egg complemented the chewy sesame seed-speckled bagel very well. My heart however, has fallen helplessly under the spell of Sacha &amp; Sons\' gregarious and robust Grilled Reuben Sandwich. 
There are two versions of Matzo Brei which is described as \"just like a pancake\"; savoury and sweet. Savoury is an Onion pancake with herbs, served with sour cream and salmon pearls. While I liked how it tasted, it is a good replica of the Chinese Onion Pancakes with savoury salmon pearls that pop and explode with every bite, and a bit of rosti elements in it when sour cream is added. Don\'t be mistaken; it\'s actually delicious, but it\'s just a bit unexpected for it tasted close to home despite being a dish from a New York-inspired deli.
Scrambled Eggs were pretty runny and well-executed, seasoned with Sturgeon and Smoked Salmon for savouriness and a tinge of sweetness from the caramalised onions, and when eaten with the toasted bagel was literally the ultimate breakfast treat because it was served warm and crisp with sour cream with a dash of dill for a herbed flavour. Such a satisfying brunch dish that everyone at the table was going \"why wasn\'t this my order!\"
Another personal favourite from Sacha &amp; Sons; these onion and potato pancakes are similar to rosti but are much thinner and lighter. They were pretty fragrant as it had the roastiness of pan-fried onions, and the Gravlax was fresh and induced a cured savouriness to the whole dish. Best had with the sour cream as it\'s pretty much like rosti, and a breakfast item that I would definitely look forward to having every now and then.
Finally, a proper beef pastrami sandwich in Singapore! Opened by the people behind Wild Honey, Sacha &amp; Sons serves an excellent New York beef pastrami sandwich at affordable prices. Go try it before it starts getting crowded! I had the Sacha\'s Reuben which is classic deli rye stacked with hand cut house beef pastrami, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing. 
Bringing all-time favourite New York Deli foods to the heart of Orchard Road is newly opened Sacha &amp; Sons. Opened by the married duo behind Wild Honey and located in Mandarin Gallery, this new deli specialises in smoked pastrami, corned beef, roast beef even smoked fish. Sink your teeth into Sacha\'s Reuben with mouth-wateringly tender pastrami, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing, or go for something different like the cured gravlax salmon latke (Jewish potato pancakes). If you\'re more into sharing, get the increasingly popular specialty meat/ fish/ dip platter that comes with bagels, pickles, coleslaw and sliced onion. This place is definitely a hot new brunch favourite! 
Sacha and Son‚Äôs version come with apple sauce and sour cream ($10), smoked salmon ($16), or gravlax salmon ($16) cured in house. I would recommend the gravalax, which came in a stack of three mini potato and onion pancakes.
Smoked Salmon, Smoked Trout Salad &amp; Hot Smoked Cream Cheese Dip; served with bagels, house pickles, coleslaw, sliced onions, tomato;
They are using common man coffee. A little surprised that they were using such new beans (just 2 days from the roasting date). This coffee is refillable.
Bagel was a little chewy but quite soft. The beef was a little dry.
The pastrami woo-laa-laa made me salivate with joy for the moment. So good. \n<br />Tender, juicy, amazingly smoked, perfectly flavoured, appeared in a drool-worthy pink hue.
Latke which is a potato pancake, tasted like a mini rosti. Topped with sour cream and fresh salmon that hints a tinge of freshness, one will not feel the overwhelming taste of creamy sour cream.  Portion is just nice for a single person share, I mean I won\'t even want to share it with others because it\'s really well executed.
Can\'t wait to go back to bed. Wishing for a bagel to fall right on my lap now.. Come on Santa you can be early
Having brunch at this NEW brunch place opened by the same owners from Wild Honey - The Reuben with pastrami that has such an intricate and intoxicating taste. Pastrami is thinly sliced and tender. Indeed, it lives up to Wild Honey\'s reputation of being one of the first brunch place in Singapore
So does the smoked salmon in the scrambled eggs in the back.
Newly opened New York Deli by Wild Honey! Classic Reuben is a yes! Super yummy steak! Their bagel not so much.
This was a worthy backup, nonetheless. They were incredibly generous with the salmon, and the bagel was soft and not too chewy.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #burpplesg #food #foodie #foodies #foodporn #foodstagram #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #singapore
Numerous cuts of that black peppered beef pastrami sandwiched between a thick brioche with squeezes of mustard in it makes the Classic Deli ($20, 150g of pastrami) my top choice here.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Served with a side of pickles (which I opted out) and coleslaw, this is definitely something that you will want for a hearty meal. You can also opt for corned beef or roast beef if pastrami doesn\'t rock your boat and also rye, bagel or gluten free bread for brioche.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Sacha &amp; Sons\n<br />Address: 333A, Orchard Road, Mandarin Gallery, Unit 03-02, Singapore 238897 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #sachaandsons #newyorkdeli #nydelicatessen #beefpastrami

Love the creamy spread on toasty sesame bagel!
Was expecting this to be super-dense, but was pleasantly surprised at how light and fluffy it was despite its satisfyingly lush texture. I also spotted vanilla beans dotting the cream, which was tinged with lemon juice to keep the cake from getting too cloying. Not out-of-this-world fabulous, but still a more-than-decent end to the first #BurppleTastemakers eat-up of 2015!
Thank you @burpple for always having these wonderful treats!

Classic Chicken Soup with Plain Matzo Balls to start off our eatup this evening! \"Exotic\" tasting - Not a big fan of the texture. 
Some say it\'s too heavy, some says they\'re too full. But these cheese cakes will bring on the \"cheese-&amp;-smile\" to your face. They are delightfully light and smooth. So easy to eat them....all. Some call it yoghurt cheesecake, some says they add yakult.
So stuffed by the the time dessert came but finished it up anyway; the Cheesecake was so creamy but light that you wouldn\'t feel heavy at all with every fork. Love the graham-cracker base that gives a soft crunch of buttery flavour!
This goes really well with the meat platter and it comes with three choices of beef: pastrami, corned beef &amp; roast beef! 
Beet root wins first round.

Ok. Nothing really to write home about.
Nice! But serving size is too small
S$18. Yum. But the bagel, very hard.
Black sesame chewy and soft bagel. 
Corned beef with potato and sunny side up. 
SO GOOOOOD. Something not too filling yet tastes perfect!!!
#hotchocolate #burpple
Stuffed Crepes with Sour Cream and Fruit Compote. These Crepes were stuffed with cheese which was really light in flavour, and came caramalised at the bottom for a short hint of sweetness. While they are good to have alone, I loved it more with the fruit compote, which induced a light berry sweetness to the Crepes.
