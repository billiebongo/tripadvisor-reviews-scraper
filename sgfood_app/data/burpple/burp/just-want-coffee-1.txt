Had Salmon &amp; Asparagus Quiche.\n<br />A deep quiche with a crisp, light pastry case &amp; flavoured salmon &amp; fresh asparagus.

Nice handmade tiramisu! Only cost $5.50, quite surprise to see the size of cake. It is big enough for 2 or more persons to eat. It is quite cold and I can feel different taste of each layer. Mocha with nice latteart, taste so good. I\'m sure I\'ll return for coffee again
