😅😅 #throwback to the Lou Hei at #sakurayck. Happy Chinese New Year everybody!!Eat and rest more!!WOOT! #shootkahliao
But I had two of this!😍😍Flaky crust, warm and wobbly custard. I do find it a little too sweet though. Still good! #sakurayck
Definitely much better than previously! Looking at this now is making me so hungry. 😂 Lunch buffet at Sakura is only $17.90+. Why not?☺️
How ah? 😭😭😭 #sakurayck
😻😻 From $17.90++ visit newly revamped Yiochukang Sakura for a wide spread of international dishes ☺️☺️ #SakuraYCK
Ready, get set, EAT EAT!
I\'ll gladly start with this bird nest egg tart. 🍴
