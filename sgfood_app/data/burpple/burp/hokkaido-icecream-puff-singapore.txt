If you\'re in the Bugis area and the heat gets unbearable, cool down with an Ice-Cream Puff ($3.90) from Hokkaido IceCream Puff. The popular ice-cream chain from Malaysia is located along the buzzy Haji Lane, great for those in the vicinity to pop by for a refreshing midday snack! There are eight ice-cream flavours including familiar mint chocolate chip, cookies and cream and the bright purple taro, all of which you can find in the ice cream push carts. The highlight is certainly the freshly baked, slightly sweetened puffs. Unlike the ones from Shuu by KOKI Tamagoyaki where the outer crust is more chewy, Hokkaido IceCream Puffs pride themselves on having super crispy shells. The strictly takeaway shop (the puff is packed in a nifty brown casing for you to have on the go) scoops your ice-cream to order, so exercise some patience during peak hours. \n<br />Avg Price: $5 per person\n<br />Photo by Burppler Dex Neo
From Hokkaido Ice Cream Puff at Haji Lane which recently opened during the weekend. The ice-cream flavours served here are pretty generic in taste; those flavours that taste pretty much off the ice-cream tubs in supermarkets that reminds you of your childhood guilty pleasures. The puff is actually pretty decent; a crossover of the crusty pie crust puff from Beard Papa and a crusty, slightly sugary Choux pastry especially for the top half.
New along Haji Lane, just pick a flavour you\'re good to go. When asked, the staff said that the Hokkaido aspect of the dessert is the puff which was actually quite nice – a good mix of crisp with a nice bite to it. 👏
Like your normal ice cream but great on a hot day. The crunchy puff pastry base is a nice touch.
Matcha &amp; Taro
Only 5 months old, they served a variety of attractive flavours. We tried their Matcha azuki and Rockmelon flavours and were thoroughly satisfied with our choices.

$3.90 for a Ice Cream puff
The choux puffs were fresh from the oven and needs a cooling off period.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Here is my charcoal choux embracing a huge dollop of mint chocolate chip ice cream. So round and fat. The way to eat ... use a spoon and slowly scoop the ice cream. Once it is half full, gently flatten both sides of choux together and eat it like an ice cream burger. Oooh... the choux so crispy with the invigorating icy minty ice cream. Yes I confess; I deliberately allow the ice cream to melt alittle and oggle at the teeniest flow. 🔸🔸\n<br />The choux smells good, tasted good as it was lovingly baked and just came out from the oven. I cannot wait for @hokkaidoicecreampuff_sg to bring back the raspberry flavor.
