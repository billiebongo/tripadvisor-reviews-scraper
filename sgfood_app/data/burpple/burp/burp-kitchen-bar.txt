The Baja Fish Tacos have a generous amount of fried fish, coleslaw, salsa fresca and spicy mayo served with corn chips at the side. That fried fish was the star of the dish ‚Äî fried to a golden brown yet so juicy and tender on the inside. The thickness of the fish makes this even more enjoyable as you can definitely have plenty of fish in every bite. Even though this was the last dish of the night and I was somewhat full by then, I couldn‚Äôt resist more helpings of it! The zesty apple slaw and salsa was tangy and made great pairings with the fish tacos.
The Pork Carnitas is a dish of soft tacos wrapping slow cooked BBQ pulled pork, coleslaw and salsa fresca. The pulled pork is beautifully seasoned with sweet tasting notes as the juices flow with each bite. The strong flavors in this will definitely appeal to those who likes stronger tasting dishes.
This is no ordinary soft shell crab burger ‚Äî it is a salted egg soft shell crab burger! The Crabby Patty Burger has a whole fried soft shell crab as the ‚Äúpatty‚Äù with salted egg sauce drizzled over it and sandwiched between two squid ink buns. How innovative! The buns had no distinct taste, but the combination was great for me. Fried food and salted egg sauce, what could go wrong? This would be the choice for you if you‚Äôre looking for an alternative to the usual beef patty burger. However, it comes at the price tag of $18 (prices are all nett here) which I find to be on the expensive side.
The Burp‚Äôs Beef is made of two brioche bun sandwiching the beef patty, american cheese, caramelized onions, pea sprouts and spicy mayo. The folks of Burp have creatively replaced the usual lettuce with pea sprouts, or what we know as dou miao. The taste of the vegetables is definitely stronger here with a more chewy bite. However, I still prefer my crunchy lettuce! The buns were not as fluffy and the patty was not as juicy as I‚Äôd like them to be, resulting it to be rather dry overall. 
The Chicken Quesadilla came with a tortilla wrapping the slow cooked pulled chicken and melted cheddar and mozzarella cheese. This was a little plain tasting as compared to the other dishes, though the melted cheese was really satisfying! 
The Salted Egg Wings are coated with the same sauce used on their tofu fries, which are all homemade! These would definitely make a great bar bite with some beer. For draught beer lovers, Burp serves Asahi Super Dry and Kronenbourg Blanc on tap.
The chicken wings here are air-fried, making it a healthier for the health conscious! The Burp Kitchen Wings are coated with the Adobo sauce ‚Äî a savoury sauce with sour tones.
Tofu cubes are being cut into strips before being fried to a golden brown. Don‚Äôt they look like spam fries? Except that this is not processed meat but a much healthier choice! Salted egg sauce was then drizzled onto them. I found the skin to be a little tough and tasted more like tau kwa than tofu to me. Perhaps I was expecting a more silky inner layer when I think of tofu, but this was on the dry side. There was also insufficient salted egg sauce but thankfully the owners kindly offered more of their wasabi mayo which I really liked too. Their sauces are all home made, and I found the salted egg sauce just right with some bits in it. But personally, I thought there could be more chilli padi as I love it spicy!
The chicken was tender and we\'ll fried. However the salted sauce seems like prepared from an instant package. It doesn\'t complement well with the chicken. Somehow tasted sweet than salty.
Salted egg tofu fries ($8) and grilled shrimp tacos ($12). Happy hour Kronenbourg (2 for $12) and house white - Gato Negro, Sauvignon blanc (2 for $16). Cosy place with great food and drinks! 
Crabby Patty - Squid ink bun, battered soft shell crab, salted egg yolk sauce and other delectable ingredients. Just look at that overflowing liu sha sauce, it\'s just simply insane. Not to forget the crispy soft shell crab which came with it, and the yummy charcoal bun, everything is just perfect.. and messy, another burger worth trying.

Love their rendition of rendang sauce, my pick over the Hog which has a hint of sweetness from the berry jam.
Looks ordinary but we loved the wonderful tangy batter!
Flaky and buttery croissant paired along with the bowl of goodness containing poached egg, mushroom, potato hash, etc ! The salted egg tofu stick was a disappointment though it\'s a healthier choice as compared to French fries since the salted egg sauce is hardly detectable. Was hopping for MORE sauce as well to pair with the plain tofu sticks. Overall the service was pleasant üëçüèª
Value hot buffalo wings üò§üò§üî•üî•
Flavourful and juicy curry pork burger!
Strong Flavours Tacos. Tender pork. Portion good for two sharing.
Recommended for those who like their food feisty!
