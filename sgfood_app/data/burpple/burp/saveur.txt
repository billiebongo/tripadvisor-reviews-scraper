Tastes intensely earthy with a slight woody burnt taste. Creamy without heaviness, but not umami enough for my palate to sing praises.
Good crisps of the skin, tender pork meat and the juicy fats. 
The duck meat is just the right tenderness. The mash is awesome too
Still good.
The only thing I need from Saveur. It\'s definitely simple and satisfying enough for me. 
If you are a big fan of seafood, then the $15.90 should regain your appetite! The texture of the skin is a liitle rough, but smoothens with the wine, making the fish meat more flavorful and delicious. Its placing and styling looks really artistic and beautiful and is worth a try, though I\'ll suggest the duck confit ($13.90) as a possible alternative :) 
The Classic French dish that is worth the price of $17.90, is surprisingly better similar dishes cooked elsewhere  because the meat is more tender and soaked to the touch by the marinated sauce. The flavor was enhanced with the combination of a glass of  Pierre Jean Red wine (credits to my lady for that choice, six dollars per glass), the meat becomes juicier and more aromatic, while the bitterness(dryness,rather) of the Jean Pierre has now turned sweet and you can taste the fruit in the wine. Would highly recommend it!!
I have heard about Saveur but I have never had a chance to try it until recently. I had their starter pasta and the duck confit and found it average at best. The price is cheap for French food but doesn\'t live up in terms of quality. Quite a disappointment for me. 
Haven\'t had this for so long, at $4.90, ok la. Angel hair pasta nicely al dante and quite tasty with little Sakura ebi and minced meat.
Tasty duck leg with mashed potato, saut√© shiitake, and tangerine at the side. The duck skin was crispy, easy to cut. Overall not bad. Rating: 3.4/5
Very unique flavor, with Chinese style minced meat and crispy shrimps. Very small serving as it was meant to be an appetizer. However, it was not warm when served. Rating: 3.7/5
Most affordable and yummilicious French cuisine in Singapore. My friend and I treated ourselves to a delicious cup of mushroom soup and 3 main dish - duck, sea bass and pork belly. Love the fun and interesting dessert of cookies and milk. 
Some French cuisine for Tuesday lunch. Duck confit at 14.90! And pasta at 4.90! Most affordable French cuisine you can find. The pasta though slightly oily, it\'s nicely al dente. The duck confit is definitely better than platypus\'s. Although flatter, the meat is tender and tasty!
Meat was soft, the curry spice and Rosemary made it complex flavor. It was not like a typical French dish, but it was good!
It was small portion but nicely saut√©ed with apple and raisins.
This dish was unique and the meat is tender too not those tough kind. Their dishes just make you salivate! Its really that good!
Overall, it was really delicious. It was tender and juicy. At $10.90 it will probably be the cheapest French food you can find in Singapore. Also the plating was well thought out (in case you did not realize it\'s played to resemble a duck haha!). 
Really enjoyed this appetizer. The flavor was very good and it really helped to open up my appetite for the other dishes that was to come
Very tiny portion, but can\'t complain for the price. It\'s so yummy~ a second serving please!üòãüòÅüëç
The special for today! Medium done roasted lamb laid on mashed with cheese. Best ever!
Chicken roulade with foie gras stuffing and basmati rice. $9.90
Salmon confit with apple and fennel in lemon vinaigrette. $9.90
Highly recommended! üòÅ
FANTASTIC FOOD. Worth every last cent (which wasn\'t a lot). Queue was horrendous though and the sitting claustrophobic. But the food was worth everything because it\'s so sublime, you transcend every sound with each bite. 
Saveur is a newly opened cafe. This dish was totally worth waiting for and was priced reasonably too. Capellini was tossed with chilli oil,chopped Japanese konbu, and Sakura Ebi with minced pork sauce. 
It was a #dessert made in #heaven! So I brought my SMU exchange buddy out for dinner cause she was craving French food, and she loved it. #smuicon #yum #mustcomebackagain #worththecalories [18/03/13]
The famous duck confit at Saveur is famous for a reason. Cause its good, simple as abc. Really good! üê¶üçù. 
Rice was creamy and rich. Chicken was tender and full of flavour. Cost $9.90
Has got to be one of my fav dish. Pretty darn good. 
Thick, not so much of creamy and super yummy to my liking. If you\'re a mushroom lover, this is a must to order. 
Melt-in-your-mouth yummy salmon confit with apple &amp; fennel + lemon vinaigrette! $9.90
Duck Confit. Skin was a tad too chewy (as opposed to being crispy), and the meat a little dried out. Love the creamy mash beneath, though! #duck #confit #frenchfood #sgfood #foodporn
Overflowing of olive smell.. Small potion to share as a side dish. The caviar just make the dish look more atas.
Duck very tender.. Once pull.. All the meats fall out.. Mashed potato is loved by Thr ladies.. 
The wet rice is so good... And buttery... Chicken tender.. Looks small.. But it very filling.
Crispy skin, tender flesh although dry at certain areas. Smooth potato puree and the orange segments add some citric acidity to the duck, which is a common French pairing. Definitely worth the money at just $10.9
Cost only $5.9 for the amazing sliced duck confit salad!!
Chicken Roulade with creamy basmati rice &amp; parmesan sauce.\n<br />Salmon Confit. Apple &amp; fennel with lemon vinaigrette.\n<br />.\n<br />Simple, casual French dining. Very reasonable too.
don\'t be fooled by its appearance; it\'s one of the cutest desserts ever! plus the sparkling sensation while eating is quite addicting. love it :-)

Salted caramel molten cake: moist, sticky, chewy and salty. Would be even better if served with vanilla ice cream instead of whipped cream. Maybe I should try making a salted gula melaka version some day... #burp @xndrew76
Duck confit: Surprisingly, this is one of the better duck confit I\'ve had, and at a relatively low price. Duck is tender and not dry. Love the buttery, fluffy mashed potato too. #burp @xndrew76
Lunch with @honkiehow @prismaticence @naan1314  before the escape game! Pasta tossed with chilli oil, fine-chopped Japanese konbu &amp; sakura ebi with minced pork sauce
What lack in visuals did make up for its taste. Simple pork belly served with couscous and a soft boiled egg. The taste compliments each other. Would be more impressed if it was visually enhanced.
Crispy skin, tender meat, delicious mash, perfect bits of shittake! And orange segments to keep it interesting. Perfect! $12.90
Possibly addicted to this: Saveur\'s Pasta tossed with chilli oil, fine-chopped Japanese konbu &amp; sakura ebi with minced pork sauce. $4.90
This is so yummy! 4.90 for a small portion, you can upsize it if you pay a few dollars more!
Everybody is at Savour 2013, I had Saveur. üòù
Good alternative for cheap French food I guessssss.
Arrived at 1:30pm n there was no queue! Finally got to try this after hearing so much abt it, n its really good for tat price! The skin was crisp n the meat tender enough. Love how the sides added flavour to the main dish :) If only the portion was larger :D
Affordable price but you will get best taste. This pistachio panacotta is a must! 
absolute price is very reasonable but portions are smallish and food nothing to shout about. go to bistro du vin for a better all round experience if you\'re looking for reasonably priced French food.
good option for a starter/side dish as main portions are smallish. 
Bought my guy to try out saveur at purvis street. It\'s supposedly French cuisine at a fraction of the price . It\'s my 2nd time there and prices has increased üòÅ
Personally think this is the most savory dish in Saveur (costs around 5 bucks), though noodle a little dry.
Creme br√ªl√©e. Portion is quite small and sugar on top has not been totally caramelised. Despite that, the dessert did deliver in the end with its creamy vanilla custard and berry compote.
Obligatory shot at Saveur! Still good even though it\'s been a while since I visited. On top of the shrimps they have now added tuna.
Chocolate &amp; Hazelnut: chocolate mousse with crushed hazelnuts, broken raspberries, roasted rice puffs, chocolate tuile &amp; praline.
Chicken roulade with foie gras stuffing, served with yummy basmati rice
Lumpfish caviar &amp; tiger prawns angel hair pasta yumzzz #latergram #foodporn

Pistachio panna cotta - a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. Lovely way to end off the Saturday
Beef bourguignon with root vegetables, mixed greens and scalloped potatoes. Tender and juicy and so incredibly good.
Grapefruit below was great too, will be better if it was slightly sweeter though

This dish has Saveur‚Äôs brand stamped on it and rightly so, it is truly an exquisite and unique dish.
It is well complemented here by the sous vide egg which has a gooey yolk and a consistently pillowy, cloudlike texture.
