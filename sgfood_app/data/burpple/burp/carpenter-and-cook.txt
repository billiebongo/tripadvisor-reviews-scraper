A cosy getaway to chill and unwind, this bakery is but a 5min walk from Beauty World MRT. The croissant and quiche were average at best, seeing that they were blasted by the microwave. üòêüòìüòï The sea salt was unevenly distributed throughout the chocolate tart.üëé It would have otherwise been delicious. üò¢ the lemon meringue on the other hand was heavenly. üëçüëçüëç Would definitely recommend the lemon meringue. Lastly, the staff was friendly and helpful, üëç making my experience a pleasant one.
The cafe is easily accessible from the beauty world MRT station. The interior of the cafe is more to vintage style. The food and drinks are also reasonably priced. Highly recommend the passion fruit meringue as it tastes really refreshing and not just sweet 
Particularly partial to lemon drizzle cake, especially the one at Carpenter &amp; Cook, where the citrusy zing is literally in the icing on the cake.
Yummy flaky and light almond pastry, earl grey loaf, bacon eggs and cheese quiche and lattes 
Love this so much that I had it twice this week! It\'s nicer if you let it \"thaw\" for awhile after it\'s served. Love the fact that the chocolate and caramel didn\'t overpower each other. The balance between the 2 is perfect! A yummy treat! 
Finally tried carpenter and cook! Very chill and cosy place for some coffee and desserts. This passion fruit meringue was really delicious, with a refreshing custard that held the right level of sourness. 
Mention Carpenter &amp; Cook and most people would think of their tarts and other pastries, but they do pretty good Carrot Cake here too. Slathered with a smooth and luscious layer of cream cheese, the cake did not feel too heavy nor sweet. Cake was moist, well filled with nuts and raisins that gave a nice chew and a bit of crunch, yet having a small hint of spiced flavour. Perhaps infusing an element of Hummingbird Cake into it, there are also bits of pineapple that gives it a tinge of sweet yet sour flavour that gave it that interesting touch.
Such a warm, inviting and pleasant place to have coffee and yummy bakes! Love this place. 
After having the passionfruit tart... Made me hungry for more..so ordered the Lemon Cream tart since it\'s the Queen of Tarts! Woo...very sour but I enjoyed it. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Wanted to check out The Udders Pancake but was too full from dinner. Saw carpenter and cook so went in for coffee. Couldn\'t resists ordering the passionfruit tart...though full, but this was good! Sweet and sour...made me wanting for more... 
The passion fruit meringue tart is a must try, together with a pot of earl grey tea, this will definitely make a good tea time at this beautiful cafe. The quiche is also worth a try for those who prefer a savory taste.
A place to spend your whole afternoon with a cup of good coffee.
High tea at @carpenterncook yesterday before the judging of the Dilmah High Tea Cafe Challenge kickstarted! I may not be a fan of macaroons, but the rose flavored macaroon sandwiched with fresh lychee puree was elegant and aromatic at the same time. My all-time fav are the scones - crumbly and dense, and oooh the. unctuous clotted cream!  Beautifully paired with Dilmah\'s rose and vanilla tea. SGD20 per pax, including a pot of Dilmah tea. Advance order (1 dat) required.  #dilmah #hightea @msginginly #openricesg #burpple @openricesg

If you have wished you had the stomach to try everything that people say is so good here, this set serves a smaller size version that enables you to try them all! (Available from 20-28 June only)
How can someone resist from getting more of this heavenly tart?
I\'m on a roll in terms of hunting down the good and bad key lime/lemon tarts in Singapore. Spider sense was tingling like mad upon the first bite of the Lemon Cream \"Queen of Hearts\" Tart ($6.50). Such an apt name which I think this tart might have already stolen many hearts away. Many have recommended the Passionfruit Tart but the Lemon tart definitely \"stole\" the night this time round. 
The Passionfruit Meringue Tart and the Lemon Cream Tart were great! Crisp tart shell and the filling had the right balance between sweetness and tartness. The Cinnamon Roll was very flaky and buttery too!
Fruit cake and lemon pie. Average price and avg taste for the dessert. 
Carpenter and Cook needs no introduction. Boasting excellently executed pastries, it is not hard to see why they are a solid establishment in the F&amp;B scene. There are so many good pastries to choose from, but what you should try are the Passionfruit Meringue Tart ($6.50), Quiche ($7), Savoury Brioche ($6.50) and Croissants (from $2.50) (heh, still a lot). The passionfruit tart has just the right amount of tanginess, complemented by the slight sweetness of the meringue, and the tart shell is perfectly crunchy. They also do one of the best quiches in town: it is eggy and custardy without being overly rich, and has a buttery, flaky crust. Furnished with quaint vintage items from around the world, this space is very welcoming for spending an afternoon at!
Essentially a carrot cake party gatecrashed by a nutty, zesty fruitcake. The cream cheese frosting wasn\'t feeling very sociable and pretty much stayed in one corner the whole time. 3.8/5
#BurppleTastemaker Huixian Tan recommends Carpenter and Cook - they have a great selection of teas, which you can pair with their  range of pastries and tarts. The passionfruit meringue tart is a must-try! #Burpple
Carpenter and Cook, had the Chocolate Croissant, Quiche, Lemon Tart and Salted Caramel Chocolate Tart. Miss my buddy and the trip. :(
Starting my birthday feasting with this beauty from my beau ‚ò∫Ô∏è  
Two times to Carpenter and Cook and I had never understood why they are so raved about. Third time and my friend ordered the Passionfruit Meringue Tart and now I understand why; its meringue had a short hint of eggy sweetness which makes it so soothing and comforting to have with the tart Passionfruit curd. It\'s great combination of sweet-sour flavours makes it a very appealing dessert than won the crowd at the table even after when we all are just too full for dessert
.\n<br />|\n<br />Vintage decoration but some how it kept reminding me of Bangkok. Nice place to chill and relax for the afternoon. .\n<br />|\n<br />I found the tart was slightly too hard and a burn taste on the filling. Maybe next time I should try something else.
If you already love Carpenter &amp; Cook, you\'ll be happy to know they\'ll be selling limited edition #GivingTuesday cookies on December 2nd. All proceeds from these cookies will go to the Yellow Ribbon Fund, providing re-integration programs for ex-offenders and social support services for their families. Imagine - all you need to do is buy as many cookies as you can! Give them away as Christmas gifts for your colleagues, or keep them as guilt-free snacks. Go on, eat to give someone a better life!
This is the first carrot cake I ever enjoyed eating.. It\'s not dry, but moist!! Yum yum :)
Soft meringue peak with citrus passion fruit filling within a crusty tart! Combination of sourish and sweetness to the taste bud. Good place for some desserts and high tea as they have plentiful of awesome treats.
pastries served was thumbs up, in fact the chocolate sea salt caramel frappe gave a good kick to the dessert. love the atmosphere too. 
‚ò∫Ô∏è Would love to sit here longer if not for the crowd. üòÇ
The quiche was yummy, but a pity that the portion is too small. Iced Chocolate tastes like Iced Milo instead. Bleh. X: Shop is so retro and vintage!!
Passion fruit meringue tart ($6.50) and sea salt caramel tart ($6.50). Good tarts but a little pricey for the size you get. Will be back for the passion fruit meringue tart! 
Sunday Brunch trying on Passion fruit Meringue Tart, Swirly Bacon Cheese Bun with a cup of Cappuccino 
Carpenter and cook baked one of the bestest pound cakes ever!! Have you tried??? 
Perfect Ambience for Short Meet ups and For Dessert. Had their Quiche, Sea Salt Chocolate Tart, Brownie with Strawberry Tea. Must visit place!
I find the egg filling a little too soft, but it\'s still nice nonetheless! The pastry and pumpkin was really well done. 
The texture of the cake in the tart was really nice!! Not too sweet and with lots of berries! 
According to the looks, I\'d expect it to be lemon flavour and chocolate tart respectively.  But amazingly it turns out to be a PASSION FRUIT MERINGUE!
lemon meringue was fantastic!! the coffees weren\'t good.. too bitter for my liking!! but really like the ambience and atmosphere there :) 
Excellent place to relax with some pastries or nice snack for a weekend.. Had the cafe latte and it was nice! For young couples who want to relax and chit chat in a cafe over the weekend 
A good ole piece of moist apple cake that is exploding with the fragrance and flavour of apples and crumble! Rustic and unpretentious, and absolutely scrummy (cause it reminds me of the English countryside) üòÅ
Lemon Tart - Was craving for something sour but sweet so I decided to go for this tart. However it was super sour. There is absolutely no sweetness in it. Don\'t judge it\'s appearance! The crust was definitely good though. For those who are looking for something REALLY sour with a very good crust, this should be in your list. I\'m glad I took a chilled earl grey tea to balanced out the taste. Lemon Drizzle Cake was served hot, the drizzle on top was not too much and the lemon used for this two dessert was definitely the same. Yes this vanilla tasting cake was delicious. Carpenter &amp; Cook is definitely good in baking. Loving their cakes and the crust but maybe not the lemon. Well.. Just prove that I am just not a lemon lover! Maybe I should have treated myself the choco tart or passionfruit tart instead. Guess I\'ll head there again soon. 
Retro themed inspired cafe. Beautiful and tasty created tarts. Passionfruit and lemon tarts recommended if u have the sour buds.
best pastries I\'ve ever had! A little inaccessible and we had to drive but it\'s all worth it! On a side note, they don\'t serve food. Strictly pastries and coffee.
Top-right anti clockwise: Passion-Fruit meringue(6.5), Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel(6.5) and Lemon Drizzle (5). The popular choice is of course the Passion Fruit meringue recommended by everyone here. But do give the Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel a try if you drop by - the flavors just burst in your mouth and melt away smoothly. It\'s not too sweet and goes very well with coffee. The Lemon Drizzle might look ordinary but you\'ll love the refreshing hint of lemon that lingers after every bite. It\'s on the sweeter side due the frosting but it goes very well with tea. 
My favourite place for awesome tarts.
$6.50 for this heavenly tart is definitely worth both money and calories. 
The deco reminds me of Bangkok. Nice to chill and read a book
I super love this one. Tastewise is a bit too sweet but hey its almost perfect for my liking. Its now in to my favorite dessert list.
An interesting twist to the Lemon Meringue Tart. The meringue is light and the passionfruit base is just the right sweetness. Perfect!
Post dinner sweets with my sweets. Desserts are pretty mandatory for the weekend.
Post dinner sweets: passionfruit meringue tart and tiramisu paired with Allerines fruit splash tea. 
Back here again for tea!
I am very attracted by the decor of this cafe and I guess this is the biggest reason why you should visit this cafe. Because vintage themed cafe is not very common in Singapore. Here\'s a photo of plain scone. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/carpenter-and-cook/
last week\'s #carpenterandcook #dinner actually.. it was normal, nothing much special. but i think it is the cosy ambience that brings people back for a chillax session with friends. but the scone was not bad! Latte $5, Scone $4, Mocha $5, Quiche $7. #friends
They were nice to toast it again when I ordered. Added together with some salad, it was about just the right amount.
Crust is buttery and firm, filled with tangy perfumy passion fruit curd and topped with chewy meringue. Classic flavours done well!
Bacon &amp; Mushroom Brioche - $6.50; Sundried Tomato &amp; Spinach Quiche - $7.00; Blueberry Crumble Muffin - $3.50; Chocolate Sea salt caramel Tart - $ 6.50
Gotta have one on your own, too scrummy to share! Charming place too!
Unplanned visit to this quaint vintage cafe! Though it was a weekday afternoon, I was surprised to see them full-house! Anyway, this lemon tart was simply tangy-licious! Flavours burst in my mouth and it was really refreshing. There was just something special about the tart shell.. Tough but not crumbly. Thumbs up! Oh, I dabao-ed their famous Chocolate Salted Caramel Tart and a Lemon Drizzle Cake to share with my friends. While there was nothing fantastic about the cake, the chocolate tart was really good. I was amazed at how balanced the sweet/salty flavours were! Too bad I forgot to take a photo. Next time then! 
Found the perfect passionfruit tart at Carpenter &amp; Cook.
Don\'t usually love quiche but I thought this was pretty good!
With desserts that are not too-perfect-to-eat but just perfectly delightful, Carpenter &amp; Cook manages to transport you to the 50s in an unpretentious, cosy way. The old benches and their authentic cutlery creates a lovely ambience for a peaceful afternoon. Don\'t miss out on their Passionfruit Meringue Tart- a perfect balance of sweet and tart.
Ice cream frenzy express, original outlet at West Coast Drive. Double scoop for $4.50. We tried soursop &amp; cranberries, salty caramel, Swiss dark chocolate and New York cheesecake. Can\'t taste the caramel and cheesecake was too milky. Chocolate ok and soursop fantastic!
A different kind of late dinner. Savoury Brioche and Ice Chocolate.
Bacon and mushroom brioche. Just nice for me ^^
Sweet treats from Carpenter and Cook! Lavender cake and chocolate maldon. üòç Love their flowery crockery. #carpenterandcook #dessert #cakes
Passionfruit meringue tart and chocolate sea salt caramel tart
Always loved the little jars used as mugs. An a-okay coffee but truly love the setting of this cosy cafe. Much love!
Queen of hearts tarts ; I would come back for more, it\'s too good!
A great afternoon spent. Thank you for the high tea. (: #carpenterandcook #dessert
I seriously have no idea what coffee art is that. But well... Let\'s not try to think too much. Lol.
post-exam chill with a banoffee pie that exudes a different permutation of bitter/sweet/salty with every bite, paired with a cappucino that froths your lips with every warm sip! with @jozegal
Thanks for all the goodies @veraley! Chocolate EVERYTHING is awesome and pocket-sized Nutella rocks my world!
Nothing like an afternoon with pastries and coffee
Love the vintage decor. 
A delightful cake - not too sweet, slightly tangy and nicely baked meringue on top. Light and fluffy texture, we polished this off in minutes!
Finally, first visit here! Cool, laid back vibe, small menu but worthy bakes. Nice tart with thin and crunchy crust (I go weak for sea-salt desserts!) I like it here, but wouldn\'t exactly travel all the way unless I happened to be in the area ;)
Carpenter &amp; Cook - one of my current Top 5 cafes. What\'s yours?
Very relaxing place and serve good coffee and cake, must try!
If you fancy desserts and appreciate interior designs, this quaint little cafe is the right place to be.

My Sunday is complete. The shopowner placed alot of emphasis on the on-ground decos and utensils. Kudos to that. #cafe #Singapore #weekend
Lemon Cream that\'s so sourishly good! We realized they are delicious with the scones too!!
