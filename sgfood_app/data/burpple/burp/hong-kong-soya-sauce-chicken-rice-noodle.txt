I love how thoughtful the team at Esquina is. There were 4 of us today but only 3 here. Can you guess why? They specially made a different one for my friend who is expecting. Such thoughtfulness goes a long way. Thanks Chef @carlosmontobbio and @myra.buccat!
(SGD 32++) Another stellar dish, this was an extra order. Denise had recommended this as well and we are certainly glad that we had ordered it to share.
Don\'t you think from afar this course looks heart shaped? For my mains, I choose the braised beef and pork cannelloni which came highly recommended by Burppler Ida C. Loved it!
Ever since I saw this on Denise\'s Instagram stories I was longing for it. So today, my lunch kakis were equally game and we shared some amongst us. The Carabinero was so full of flavour and I was shamelessly sucking every morsel of goodness from the head. The oil was so good that one piece of toast just wasn\'t enough and what did I do? Shamelessly asked the Chef for another. Just couldn\'t let the oil go to waste.
I chose the Menu del Dia (menu of the day) which was a steal for SGD38++. You get a snack, tapas, mains and dessert. For my snack, I had Esquina\'s spanish omelette. It was really yummy and not to mention extremely pretty. Lunch started off on a very good note!
Yeah this is the opposite of that philosophy... This is pure indulgence, the exuberant and yet refined union of truffles, foie gras and bechamel with beef, pork and crepe that makes for such thrilling mouthfulls that I can just barely refrain from eye banging the rest of the cannellonis coming from the kitchen for the rest of the meal... and truthfully, the first time I tried this, I did immediately order seconds... uncouth maybe, stupid no...
What does it cost for us to like a restaurant on Facebook?  Apparently, just the promise of a special treat... which turned out to be this chocolate bread... which was totally worth it because it was amazing!
I have to imagine this would be the kind of magical fusion cuisine that would spring up.   This Spanish tortilla tasted like the love child of a traditional tortilla Espanola with a blini, playfully studded with olive oil caviar and let loose to run through a big pan of paella, filching all the creamy aioli on the way!
... was frightfully devastated by Hurricane Ida!!!  In the aftermath, all that was left was a small green puddle of basil sorbet that no amount of scooping with my spoon could pick up...
The Esquina team were kind enough to give this hungry preggy this tiny vanilla ice cream cone in place of the frozen sangria cone... it was delicious and exquisitely fun to eat!
This one is kind of a no brainer... if you want kids to eat veggies, make sure to cook delicious veggies!  Can\'t go wrong with roasted cauliflower, especially when bejeweled with Spanish ham on a bed of yummy cous cous...
So... the weekday lunch deal at Esquina is really spectacular with 4 courses at just $38...I know, insane right!  This main of ribeye, romesco and charred leeks will set you back an extra $5, but it will leave feeling pretty satisfied for the value deliciousness for the money!
This josper grilled carabinero prawn sparkled, but the real fight was over the incredibly nuanced oil, with intense prawn overtones further enhanced by garlic, chilli flakes and the gentle punch of quality salt... luckily, Burppler BlueSkiesCottonClouds charmed chef into giving us extra bread to soak up allllllll of that decadent oil...
An oldie but goodie. Set lunch won\'t break the bank either. These are the mains and desserts from today\'s menu- I very rarely say this but all were perfect.  Two options per course so come with a friend to try everything.
2 options for each course. Bring a friend and you can try them all. Especially love the roasted cauliflower ❤️
They are having a 5 course anniversary menu for only $55 till the end of the month. Best way to sample their signatures without breaking the bank. More on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio!
This pretty one from @esquinasg is made with\n<br />bacalao brandade with a slightly gelatinous roasted slice of pepper for that sashimi texture. Check out Esquina\'s 5th anniversary menu avail till end jan 2017. Their 5 course menu which presents their signatures costs only $55. More on stories!
Amazingly charred cauliflower w a bed of cauliflower cous cous, pieces of well roasted serrano ham and grated manchego cheese ($16) cauliflower CANNOT get any better than this 🔥
Spanish omelette ($6 each) was a good mix of confit onions, eggs, potato and crispy, thin toast. The blend of potato and concentrated onion flavour reminded me of 葱油饼, but you\'ll never find exquisite details like olive oil caviar on that.
Second visit to Esquina and I jus had to reorder this dish! Absolute favourite 😋
If it\'s your first time heading down to Esquina, THIS is a must try. Served with an artichoke purée, the octopus is tender and packs a wonderful smoky flavour. Throwing the sweetness of the burnt onions and oyster leafs into the mix just gives it that nice depth in flavor. Every element on the dish complements each other. It\'s an absolute delight.
Braised beef &amp; pork cannelloni, with foie gras, cepes béchamel and black truffle. We initially saw this dish being prepared by the chef and thought it was a dessert because it looked so simple and elegant. Yet the rich braised beef and pork filling tantalised our tastebuds with such an intricate flavour. The cannelloni was silky smooth, gloriously basking in the rich cepes (porcini mushroom) béchamel. It might get rather overwhelming for some people, so don\'t be greedy and share this (&amp; all their dishes!) with your buddies. I can totally understand why they serve it towards the end of our meal.
On the first cut, we raised our eyebrows because it took us quite an effort to cut. My dining partner even expressed his initial doubt only to be proven wrong upon chewing it. The octopus was well executed with such a perfect tenderness (not too soft either, which I personally detest). It retained the juiciness and smokiness as it was steamed before being grilled. Another shout out would be for the burnt onion slice that was so unbelievably sweet, letting you forget the typical onion taste and smell for a while. It seems like the usual oyster leaf (in the menu) was replaced by pickled seaweed (as mentioned by the head chef upon serving it to us) but it was definitely as lovely. It possessed a sharp acidic flavour at first but with a mild balsamic aftertaste. Such a harmonious contrast in flavour which makes this my personal favourite of the night.
After having this dessert, I really can\'t think of a better way to end our meal that night. This is not in the menu and was served to us on the house (gracias muchas!): chocolate ganache on toast with sea salt and olive oil caviar. It gave a short yet bold orgasmic sensation to our tastebuds without being too heavy after the fulfilling meal. The crispy thin toast was in perfect contrast to the smooth chocolate ganache yet they were brought harmoniously together by the savoury olive oil caviar. A marriage that went so well and was indescribable by superfluous adjectives.
Compliments to chef on this remarkable slab of pork in all its golden-skinned glory. Every bite – an incredible composition of crispy crackling, melty fat and juicy flesh – was just pure bliss, I tell you. Pair with those caramelised pineapple chunks and... MIND. BLOWN.
$28. The cod was flaky, tender and fresh. The best part of the dish apart from the cod was the black garlic. The excellent contrast between the tomato chickpeas and black garlic made for a visually stunning dish. 
$28. Highly recommended. The octopus was grilled to perfection, the meat tender and flavorful. Loved the artichoke purée that complemented the octopus. Definitely order this!
Yes, yessss, YESSSSSSSS.
Brought the parents for a lunch treat at Esquina last month and was quite blown away at how spectacular the food was. And at just $38++ for 5 courses, this has gotta be the best lunch steal around.
Tucked into the corner of Jiak Chuan Road (\'esquina\' translates to \'the corner’ in Spanish), this restaurant boasts a raw, industrial vibe, and features a long counter with bar stools that wrap around an open kitchen. Get ready for a sea-focused Mediterranean feast, best embodied by one of Esquina\'s classics — a rich, creamy sea urchin, crab and lobster bisque with smoked herring roe and sea grapes ($22), served in the visually astounding sea urchin shell. Follow this with the Grilled Spanish Octopus ($28) that\'s first sous vide to obtain tenderness, charred for a smoky flavour and served with Jerusalem artichoke, burnt onion and oyster leaf. Don\'t leave without digging into the epic “PBJ” ($15): peanut butter parfait, banana, cherry jam, and puffed grains. You\'ll enjoy this unpretentious, grungy spot that screams industrial chic while watching the chefs at work too.
The octopus had a sensual and deeply roasty quality which extended to its very core, and its suction cups will disengage recklessly inside your mouth, offering more artillery for your crunching pleasure. Elsewhere, the burnt onion will leave a sweet, oily valentine on your lips. 4.1/5
The sweet paella was slickly oiled with a delectably sticky crunch, being a perfect foil for the chaste innocence of the well-cooked snapper, whilst elsewhere the chewy, juicy chorizo had intense pig dictatorship intentions. 4/5
The rich &amp; creamy bisque was made of pureed sea urchin and a reduction of crab and lobster, with generous portion of crab meat. It was served in a sea urchin shell on a bed of sea salt, alongside a spoon fof the gifts from the sea - one of the best sea urchin dishes so far.http://missneverfull.com/singapore-esquina-by-jason-atherton/
Knowing I need to work off my desserts in advance. One of the best interpretations of PB&amp;J, Esquina\'s dessert boasts an epic peanut butter ice cream that\'s accompanied by bruléed bananas, toasted shredded bread, and a decadent rum and raisin jam. All this yumminess taunting me while I\'m at the gym 😠
Being able to watch chefs at work is my favourite when eating out. Seeing the attention and effort put into creating such immaculate dishes makes me feel really privileged 😊
The marquee name essentially tastes like a bitter and smooth ball of blended grass. The succulent strawberries and sweet tomatoes lend their sweetness to balance out the sorbet\'s bitterness, while the yogurt was sour and ever so slightly tart. The brown swirls around the plate are actually black pepper meringue, which tastes like popcorn! Half the fun of having this dessert was trying to scrape the meringue off the plate in as poised and dignified a manner as possible in front of the glamorous-looking Ang Mohs around. 3.9/5
The scallops were fresh and bouncy lumps of happiness whilst the duck was chewy, just a tad tough and rather salty. You probably never tasted coconut rice quite like this - it was not merely fragrant like Nasi Lemak rice is, but was literally soaked in coconut milk for unadulterated coconut goodness. However, all these elements and their respective texture and taste seemed like different canvases and showcases for the true star that is the dramatically coloured, spicy and amazing dark green curry paste to shine, as the paste tasted ever so slightly different with each pairing. Quite marvellous and one of my most memorable startlingly good mains ever. 4.6/5
Although it looks as if mango and foie gras left little poop swirls, this dish is definitely more hit than shit - the crispy chicken skin is a delightful mix of sweet and savoury, with the Maggi-esque curry powder adding some addictive spice to the mix. 4/5
Essentially how an egg would taste if it were the product of a hen\'s tawdry liaison with a very charming pizza with handlebar moustache. 3.7/5
The food here isn\'t afraid to be innovative and fun. At a recent catch-up lunch with a friend, we ordered a few small plates to share and were quite pleased with everything generally. The seaweed dashi poached oysters were very fresh and the onion foam, amazing. Even though my friend\'s not a fan of beetroot, he thought the salt-baked beetroot with whipped burrata and truffle honey was tasty. We both found the sweet heirloom tomato salad that was served with smoked anchovies and a watermelon gazpacho refreshing. The first spoonfuls of the confit squid with chorizo paella had us both in paroxysms of bliss. With more hits than misses, Esquina is worth revisits.
This isn\'t your typical burger. Nope, what we have here ladies and gentlemen, is a luxed-up version that has nothing to do with cow. Instead, what keeps the top bun away from the bottom bun are thick patties of VERY succulent Iberico BBQ pork and foie gras. You get two of these juicy babies for $29++.
The \"Modern &amp; Classic Sangria\" ($14++) is quite a clever concoction. The liquid half at the bottom is old-school sangria, made of red wine that has had pears, strawberries and oranges soaked in overnight. The top half though is what happens when the same sangria is used to fill a foam gun and then sprayed out. Brilliant bubbliciousness! I had fun drinking this.
remind me again, why do we keep trying new tapas places when we already found the best long ago?
ok what I really wanted to show is a pic of the beef tartare ($24++) but unfortunately that falls into the tastes good looks bad category
With compliments from the chef. Balanced lightness and creaminess perfectly. This was so good.
The Iberico pork was good, but sadly i could barely taste the foie gras.
With duck green curry, coconut rice and peanut crumbs. My favourite dish of the night. Those scallops could not have been cooked more perfectly.
That came with crispy bread to mop up the egg yolk, sea urchin and foie gras goodness
With sea urchin mayonnaise, egg yolk dressing, seaweed and frozen foie gras
Very flavorful dish. Will have it another time. Good for 2 to share. $34. Paella served on a separate bowl. Not in this pic. 
Fried Spanish churros, chocolate mousse &amp; orange salad. Sinful but sooooo good!
Sea urchin &amp; crab bisque, sea grapes and herring roe. The best! @jeslinka
crowd favorite I guess. one can do little wrong with sugared donuts and chocolate.
some deconstruction going on here. unfortunately plating looks like someone died. but no one dislikes peanut butter ice cream, right?
on the menu it comes with snapper but I usually request for them to leave out the snapper as I find it hard and dry. paella is faultless though. 
roasted meats aren\'t my thing (I prefer grilled charred meats 😁) but these were tender and juicy. cumin was strong in the cauliflower puree. overall flavors quite heavy/rich, some lightness in texture from the cauliflower cumin chips.
fresh sweet scallops with crisp radishes and yuzu ice chips providing counterpoint in texture. reminds me of my radish/crab starter at Eleven Madison Park in 2011. mmmm. 
a bit heavy handed on the salt yesterday but still good. crab meat soaked in a thick urchin flavored bisque. accompanied by some roe but that doesn\'t really add much to this dish.  
I\'m not a huge fan of beetroot but having it with honeycomb burrata, pine nut crumble and lots of toasted pine nuts is an absolute textural fiesta in the mouth! The flavours are beautifully balanced too. 
Don\'t you just want to swirl that confit egg yolk with everything else? The hand-chopped beef is wonderfully seasoned and the frozen foie gras is a pleasant surprise. 
Thinly sliced discs of cured scallops with radish salsa and elements of refreshing yuzu! 
Jammed with loads of flavours, this light and foamy bisque is a refreshing riff especially for those who don\'t like the creamy version.
Thanks for the grub Leong!
Beautiful on the outside (plating) and on the inside (my tummy)... #esquinasg #sgfoodie #sgfood #basilsorbet #burpple
Esquina\'s lunch deal is unbeatable at 5 courses for $38++ (this main course had a reasonable supplement of $5)... and menu changes daily!!! #lunchdeal #burpple #esquinasg #sgfoodie #sgfood
decadent... one really isn\'t enough #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #burpple #canneloni
However, for the price one pays I’d expect at least a few lobster chunks. Nonetheless, the Paella was prepared using the lobster head which is always the best part of any shellfish. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />The Saffron aioli and sea urchin are the weaker link here as they are being outcasted by the strong flavour of the lobster. But the thing I love about this Paella is that they added the “Burnt Ends Rice” to it.  Crispy, charred burnt smell - Which is the main reason you eat Paella or any other Claypot rice dishes. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #Esquina #EsquinaSG #UnlistedCollection #spanish #tapas #paella #seaurchin #uni #lobster #saffron #aioli #snowpeas
🍴\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: Every time when I have Suckling Pig, I can’t help but compare it to how the Chinese or the Philippines prepare theirs, be it roasted pig or Lechon. Esquina executes theirs rather well. Uber crispy skin, juicy and silky smooth meat. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />A little too fatty for my liking but the Christmasy Rhubarb and Apple chutney cuts the oiliness nicely. Take a chunk of the Suckling Pig, swirl it with the mulled wine jus then chase it with the chutney. If this preparation doesn’t put you in the Christmasy mood, I don’t know what will. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #Esquina #EsquinaSG #UnlistedCollection #MeatShow #sucklingpig #pig #spanish #tapas #pork #rhubarb #Apple #chutney #crackling
🌊\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: If there’s just one “Snacks or starters” you should get, it’ll be this hands down. Freshly shucked Brittany Tsarksya Oyster is bathed in jalapeño ponzu that brings out the sweetness and is addictive especially when paired with a glass of cava. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />The salmon roe and pickled ginger flower makes each Oyster a refreshing delight to have, the Japanese inspiration is prominent and if you have a deeper pocket on that day order half a dozen of it. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #Esquina #EsquinaSG #UnlistedCollection #tapas #brittany #tsarksya #oyster #snacks #jalapeño #ponzu #salmonroe
🍫\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: The palate cleanser depends on what you had before the desserts I assume, either Chocolate Ice Cream or Sangria Sorbet Cone. Then comes the “BBC”... 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />The combination of Dark Chocolate with sea salt naturally brings out the sweetness in the chocolate, topped with olive oil caviar gives the dessert a much more smooth finish. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #Esquina #EsquinaSG #UnlistedCollection #SugarCakePie #Chocolate #icecream #brioche #oliveoil #caviar #seasalt #dessert

Love the open concept kitchen, service, chefs, everything here! ❤️\n<br />-\n<br />Lunch set menu at $38 ++ for 4 courses\n<br />1) Snack: Esquina\'s omelette:confit onion, potato, crispy bread, olive oil caviar\n<br />2) Tapas: beetroot pickled, whipped truffle burrata, raspberries, smoked walnuts \n<br />3) Main: georges bank scallops, jerusalem artichoke, chorizo crumbs, burnt onion sauce \n<br />4) Dessert: \'BBC\', textures of banana, beer ice cream and warm caramel sauce
Sautéed upon order till the edges are crisp, finish with a killer burnt onion sauce and the organic egg yolk just adds on to the richness of the dish. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />Pieces of iberico ham are scattered for that extra oomph, the truffle lends its subtle fragrance to the overall Potato “Mille-Feuille”. A dish that I’d always gladly order every time I’m here. Just thinking about the number of hours and workmanship on this alone is quite mind boggling, the S$20 bucks is worth every damn process and slice. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #Esquina #EsquinaSG #UnlistedCollection #potato #truffle #gratin #onion #organic #eggyolk #iberico #millefeuille #ibericoham #tapas
🍌\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: There are a number of options from their desserts section but get the signature which is the “BBC”. I like the play on the textures of banana whcih consists of; cubes of banana cake, espuma, creamed banana slices &amp; banana cubes. 🤤\n<br />.\n<br />But the highlight is the Beer Ice Cream, refreshing with the fragrance of beer lingering behind and the warm caramel sauce brings the sweetness that completes the dessert. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #Esquina #EsquinaSG #UnlistedCollection #beer #icecream #banana #caramel #espuma #bananacake #SugarCakePie #BeerIcecream
Love how this desert combines the sweetness of bananas and bitterness of the beer into a symphony
And I loved how the dressing brought out the freshness of the oyster.. Loved the sour salty taste that this dish brings to my palates.. Yum
Chunks of fat fragrant lard just melting in my mouth along with that piece of crispy skin! Superb, especially with that mulled wine that we just simply can\'t get enough of
My new favourite dish at Esquina. Believe it or not but the dish that I will recommend people to come Esquina for will be a plate of grilled lettuce! The creaminess of the herb yogurt and the sharpness of the vinegar glaze cuts through the charred lettuce in a way unimaginable!\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #sgfoodies #foodie #foodsg #sgfoodporn #foodporn #foodgasm#eatoutsg #foodpornsg #instafoodsg #foodstagram #delicious#singaporeeats #sgfoodie #instasg #foodporn #sgfood #igsg #foodpics#instagramsg #instafood #sgmakan #sgig #foodphotography#vscofoodie #chasingdelicious #buzzfeedfood #sgfoodblogger #foodblogger
😛 They do also have a tendency to serve seriously #delicious little plates of flavourful morsels that delight the palate. Glad to have finally tried @esquinasg in a rather serendipitous way with lovely people on their last night in town, after hearing so much about it! 😋

Sea urchin and lobster paella with saffron aioli and snow peas. I would normally have preferred my paella with a crusty crispy bottom (socarrat). However this version came with uni and that is a combination which is hard to resist!\n<br />*\n<br />US \'family reserve\' ribeye with charred leeks and Romesco sauce. Tender yet well charred on the outside.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Similar to my previous post on burnt toast which came with the carabinero, the octopus tasted burnt as well. We felt disappointed not just because the octopus was burnt but that the kitchen had obviously not been listening to our feedback.\n<br />*\n<br />I do want to note that we were subsequently served complimentary desserts. Thank you very much for the thought but it would have been better to solve the issue at hand, serve the octopus again for example. We would have preferred to be able to taste the octopus for what it should be.\n<br />*\n<br />I typically do not post such negative comments unless I  feel strongly that constructive feedback must be given, which in this case it is necessary as we were served burnt food 3 times!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I had this during my recent lunch visit and I was very keen for my husband and mum to try it. The flesh of the carabinero shrimp had a naturally sweet flavour which was very different from the shrimps which we are used to eating.\n<br />*\n<br />We were advised to squeeze the innards of the shrimp head out and use the bread to soak up the oil (with the yummy innards and all).\n<br />*\n<br />This was when our dinner started to go downhill. The bread was burnt and everything tasted bitter. We asked for another serving of bread requesting that it be not toasted or lightly toasted. It came toasted just the same and burnt as well (although less so than before). You can imagine our surprise to be served burnt bread twice. The comment which came back from the kitchen was that the bread must be served toasted. I get it but surely not burnt?? We were even more surprised to be charged for the extra burnt bread!\n<br />*\n<br />I think good service should be commended but equally poor service should be improved upon and criticisms received constructively. I truly hope this was a one-off. *\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Served with piquilo (pepper) mayo. Tasty but a little too cheesy.

With jalapeño ponzu, salmon roe and pickled ginger flower.\n<br />*\n<br />I didn\'t manage to try them the last time round at lunch as a table ordered more than 20 the night before! Now that I\'ve had them, I can totally understand why they were so popular! They were so creamy and sweet 😋.\n<br />*\n<br />They were named such because they were cultivated specially for the Russian gourmands, specifically the Russian Tsars.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

These tasted of berries and were very refreshing as plate cleansers.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was an extra order, a seasonal item from the board. The carabinero (scarlet shrimp) was amazingly sweet. So sweet we couldn\'t let the shrimp head go to waste! Thank you @blueskiescottonclouds for ordering this.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
It looked so beautiful that I couldn\'t resist stealing a bite from @veronicaphua\'s plate. This was the other choice for the main. I loved how the artichoke purée complemented the scallops so well. Not forgetting the yummy burnt onion and chorizo crumbs too! 😋\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
With pulled pork on top of the burger patties and served with cabbage slaw and tartar sauce. Although the burgers looked ordinary, they were packed full of flavour. I\'ve never had a pork burger, let alone one so tasty. I dare say that it tasted better than many beef burgers I\'ve had!\n<br />*\n<br />The set lunch, which is available on Tuesdays to Fridays, is really good value. For $38, you get 1 snack, 1 tapas, 1 main, 1 dessert and 1 cone. Thanks @pinkotoro for the recommendation and @blueskiescottonclouds for organising this lunch.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
I loved this. So light and refreshing, this reminded me of British summers and picnics.
The combination with cauliflower cous-cous, Serrano ham and Manchego cheese (made of sheep\'s milk) tasted amazing. I finished it in no time at all 😜.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
This was instead light and fluffy. Served with confit onion, garlic aioli and olive oil caviar, it was very tasty too 😋. The thin slice of toast on which the omelette sits on added nice crunch to the bite.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_esquina #esquinasg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

You can get them as a treat by following @esquinasg on Facebook. They were really delectable.
Absolutely delicious! The slightly charred cauliflower, the salty, crispy bits of Serrano ham and the grated Manchego just blended in such perfect harmony.

banana香蕉蛋糕和香蕉奶油泡沫新鲜香蕉 beer啤酒冰激凌 caramel热的焦糖酱 啤酒冰激凌+香蕉泡沫绝对是惊喜 泡沫比普通奶油质地更轻盈不容易腻 冰激凌加入啤酒有点气泡感 口味搭配绝赞 清盘大概没花到两分钟
区别于直接端锅 是盛在碗里 底部均匀抹好橙色的pepper sauce 米饭是从平底锅中盛出 本是同根生吖 短米用龙虾汤和藏红花炖出 风味十足  妥妥做到al dente以外还略带一种锅巴的脆感 最后当然是新鲜日本海胆化在嘴里的ummmm……牛油果酱助攻 调味和foc的那个有点类似 都很喜欢 停不下勺子
这个肝酱超好吃 刷上焦糖火炙再放烤箱 盘子也抹一层焦糖酱 顶上碎香葱就是没道理的添香 没想到的是底部千层酥皮 完全得心的调味 胆固醇的浓香治愈
烤彩椒+鳕鱼泥 造型很漂亮 看过这道菜有心理预期但还是被惊喜到 鳕鱼泥质地细腻撑起鲜和一点点咸 彩椒烤出甜味 有趣又好吃
I wish the overall taste was as fanciful as the appearance tho hahaha. It was a delectable dessert, except for the unfamiliar taste of the basil sorbet 😅 Some people might find this dessert intriguing, but nah I prefer a more conventional combination of ingredients on my plate 🙃\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />💲: $14++\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #tapasbar #spanishfood #desserts #desserstagram #burpple #instafood #foodies #instafoodies #sgfoodies #sgfoodgrammers #foodgrammers #indofoodies #jktfoodies #singapore #sgeat #eatoutsg #sgrestaurant #sgbar #foodstagram #foodgasm #foodporn #basilsorbet #strawberries #marshmallow
This one is a sea urchin and lobster paella with saffron aioli and snow peas. I\'d say the sauce wasn\'t that spectacular, but perhaps it\'s to make the taste of the sea urchin more distinct.

Last meal of 2016. Ok bye. #umamiexplosion 💥💣#fatisflavour #sgfood #instafood #hangryeats #burpple #feastmode
One of our voted favorite dishes for the night. ($28++) There was a slight charred flavor and the softness in the flesh of the octopus leg was just perfect. Topped with the oyster leaf (seaweed)and burnt onion, this was a mix of textures and flavors in one bite !
:)..I\'m usually only here for 2 things.. The sangria and the sea urchin bisque :) But in recent times I think the sangria has lost its charm on me.. It used to be really fruity and smooth on the tongue.. This time it\'s pretty diluted and there\'s a lot of sediments in it.. Starting to get disappointed with my fav sangria in Singapore.. But luckily the sea urchin is still fabulous :)..the creamy bisque coupled with the chunks of crab and lobster.. Made my companion for the night go mmm.. Satisfied.. Will definitely come back for more uni! \n<br />#burpple #seaurchin #uni #datenight #sangria #esquina #chope #Tanjongpagar

Crispy squid with squid ink sauce!
US “Family Reserve”, beef ribeye, 34 charred leeks, romesco. Superbly done. So tender you can\'t help wanting a second!
Grilled Spanish octopus, Jerusalem artichoke, burnt onion, oyster leaf
Roasted cauliflower, cauliflower cous-cous, serrano ham, Manchego cheese
Sea urchin, crab &amp; lobster bisque, smoked herring roe, sea grapes
It\'s nice to see the use of savory ingredients, such as cheeses, in making desserts.  In this case, goats cheese is used and the chefs were able to deliver a good execution. Topped with sweet raspberries, oat crunch and some nice and spongy honeycomb to complete the dish. What a way to end the meal with our 14 plate! \n<br />Esquina, Singapore
A number of good things in one dish.  Ox Cheek, Bone Marrow, balanced by the sweet and sour onion jam and gentlemen\'s relish. Served with toast. A perfect way to start a mea...with lots of fatty goodness!!! Esquina, Singapore
The Burrata went well with the pickled beetroot  which cut though the creaminess of the cheese. Tha raspberry is a nice addition that added a nice berry twist to the dish. The Jamon Croquetas were also a delight to eat. Fluffy with just enough saltiness from the Jamon and its also not too oily. \n<br />Esquina, Singapore
The individual seafood components were cooked separately, making each perfectly cooked.  The light and crispy baby squid was a sure winner. Dipped in a garlicky squid ink sauce. 2 out of the 14 dishes that we shared amongst the 3 of us. Good food with an amazing company for a wonderful get together. \n<br />Esquina, Singapore
So hungry for this melt-in-mouth soulful goodness, the most impressive deconstructed tiramisu recently.http://missneverfull.com/singapore-esquina-by-jason-atherton/
