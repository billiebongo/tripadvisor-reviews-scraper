Tried their Banana Chocolate Shibuya toast. It looks like the ultimate food porn subject, but the experience of eating it isn\'t so pleasant. Firstly, I had absolutely no idea where to start, and the staff didn\'t explain either, so what I did was so cut the bread and try to break it apart. Secondly, you could get a bit sick of eating it after awhile, as there\'s way too much toast. I felt like I was eating bread more than dessert. At least the vanilla ice cream tasted good and complimented well with the buttered toast, but there\'s just way too much bread. 
I “loaf” Shibuya toast dough much.\n<br />See what I did there?!\n<br />…sorry.
Ambience is nice but ice cream is so so. Rum and Raisin flavour - raisins are dry and not infused with rum. $4.50 per scoop. 
😍 Drove to the extreme west for Archipelago Creamery, decided to go ahead with butterscotch waffle because their shibuya toast comes with 2 scoop of vanilla gelato and we can\'t choose our flavours 😟 Anyway, overall disappointing.
Finally got to try this when I slept over at the sister\'s hall - great toast and friendly service!! But maybe to share this between more than two people because we were stuffed bahaha. 
Their most popular Shibuya Toast- Hazelnut and Choco. Loved how the toast had a good proportion of cream, honey, strawberries and bananas to go with the toast. I especially loved how buttery the bread cubes within the toast had which could stand alone even without all the other distractions. Their toast didn\'t had an overwhelming amount of cream that makes you cringe. My favourite part of the toast was to take a small amount of cream to smear on the bread cubes YUMZ. Alternatively, if you are not a fan of cream, you could still find joy in dipping the cubes into the honey which taste equally satisfying. However, beware of the hard outerlayer of the toast that could be difficult to cut and tear through.
The Christmas edition of shibuya toast came with candy canes, whipped cream, sliced kiwis, blueberries paired with two scoops of after eight ice cream. The toast lacked in flavor and fragrance and the ice cream was just sweet, super sweet. I tried the rocher (it has bits of Nutella and some nuts?) and PBJ, the flavor was weak and everything was just creamy and sweet. 
They have a variety of flavours and I tried almost all the flavours before deciding which ones to go along with my waffles. Their ice cream does not melt quickly too. Not that this is bad but I would I prefer a more crispy waffle.
The ambience in this place is amazing! Very nice nautical-themed place with good lighting (from outside) :-) ordered salted almond and early grey lavender ice cream, and they were both really good! The salted almond tasted really unique. Strong almond flavor with salt. 👍🏼 the earl grey lavender had a well balanced tea flavour, though after eating awhile it kinda got really sweet. The disappointing dish was their waffles. This was supposed to be red velvet, but there was hardly any taste of it and the waffles were a bit mushy-like :-( come here for their ice cream instead!! 👍🏼 and try their toast too. Looked good! But a tad pricey! 😁
Those who like their waffles slightly more bready, soft and fluffy would like this one, which comes with a chocolate drizzle over the waffle. Went for one of the new flavours for the ice-cream; Briigen Breakfast which is creamy and comes with the flavour of cornflakes; reminds me of a good bowl of cereal and milk.
With soft, fluffy &amp; buttery bread cubes hidden within the formidable crisp structure, the generous amount of vanilla ice cream &amp; topping gave an optimal balance of complimenting textures &amp; flavours. Those living near Jurong East’s Nanyang CC, you got yourself a gem.\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 4.2/5\n<br />Worth the calories? C’mon, who cares about calories now?

Ordered daily special waffle and it was Matcha today. Café in the West! Situated just at Nanyang CC. Head down to Archipelago Creamery for your ice cream x waffles fix. Purrfect! 
The first flavour reminded us of cereal and milk, and the latter was extremely fragrant. Two thumbs up!👍🏼👍🏼
The red velvet waffle was of a soft and chewy variety, whilst elsewhere the peppermint ice cream could cure mild sore throats and the milky banana ice cream hid a naughty overnight nutty brownie guest. 3.5/5 
Shibuya toast - Banana Choc \n<br />Servings: 2-3pax\n<br />Price: $14.80 nett
First time having Shibuya Toast! •$14.80• The toast have this buttery taste and its crispy! Vanilla icecream with banana, strawberries &amp; blueberries, accompanied with whipping cream &amp; salted caramel sauce. 
Finally a cafe near my area! The waffles were crispy and soft on the inside while the ice creams were flavorful. Do try their earl grey lavender! 
Wasn\'t a fan of toast but this loaf was really full of surprises. With soft, fluffy &amp; buttery bread cubes hidden within this formidable crisp structure, the generous amount of vanilla ice cream &amp; toppings also gave an optimal balance of complimenting textures &amp; flavours.\n<br />:\n<br />Feedback: Despite being the only customers in the late afternoon, the toast actually took 21 mins (&gt;average of 11 mins) to arrive. Not sure if it\'s just our luck but my team was genuinely concerned about the future waiting time if the place ever go full house 😵 Nevertheless, we love everything else &amp; would probably return to try out other ice cream flavours 😊
Whilst the fortress walls may prove unsurmountable unless the dining party consists of eight pre-breakfast Primary Two boys before Sports Day at MacRitchie Reservoir Park, what lies beyond is surprisingly good and luxuriously indulgent – soft and buttery bread cubes, crunchy granola, actual hazelnuts, juicy strawberries and mutantly huge blueberries with hazelnut sauce and an accompanying and rather expensive-tasting honey.
I am surprised and impressed by the quality of the ice cream. Rarely do you see one which uses ground vanilla beans in their vanilla flavours. \n<br />Not only that, the other flavours that we shamelessly tried (😛) were pretty good too. \n<br />Except for Jersey milk &amp; honey that one was not to our liking, haha!\n<br />Cute shovel spoons by the way. \n<br />#dessert #icecream #shovel #burpple

Their 🍦 is really 👍 and most importantly it\'s super near my house! So glad that I don\'t have to travel far to get my #wafflesandicecream craving fix anymore ✌️😋
Westsiders rejoice as nautical-themed ice cream parlour Archipelago Creamery drops anchor at Nanyang Community Club (somewhat) near NTU. Standard flavours such as the coffee-flavoured Shangri-Latte and Milk &amp; Honey are priced at $3.50 per scoop, while premium flavours such as the Tali-Bourbon are priced at $4.50. An extensive array of desserts such as waffles, pancakes and Shibuya toasts is also available. Throw any notion of self-restraint out the window and just go for the Chocolate Hazelnut Shibuya Toast ($14.80) — two scoops of any ice cream, topped with a wild honey drizzle, fresh berries and whole hazelnuts! #yolo
But I would suggest a rounder ice-cream scoop ya? &amp; Baby chairs please! 😆😋
This creamery should provide a cool breath of fresh air for both cafe-starved NTU students and water Pokémon.
Archipelago Creamery is a new ice-cream parlour that is just opened a couple of days ago at Nanyang Community Centre that serves ice-cream, Shibuya Toast, Waffles and Pancakes. Coming in several choices of toppings, each Shibuya Toast also comes with two flavours of ice-cream. I like how the toast isn\'t too dry despite being toasted, and the honey drizzle was so soothing without being stingingly sweet which paired so well with the toast. The toast cubes on the inside were soft and lightly buttered, and I like the whole hazelnuts they included for the crunch. We picked the Shangri-Latte and Tali-Bourbon ice-cream; both were smooth though seemed to pale out in the toast because there were so much goodies happening in the toast (not complaining about it though). Not potentially life-changing, but I like the amount of quality ingredients included in the Shibuya Toast and definitely a spot to hit if you are ever around Boon Lay/Jurong West/NTU.
From the newly-opened Archipelago Creamery at Nanyang Community Centre. Flat White is an off-the-menu item, but I am sure they would be glad to do one if you ask. Brewed from a blend from Two Degrees North Coffee Co, this had a fruity body with a nutty finish.
Always make it a point to swing by @archipelagocreamery when I\'m in the Far West! \n<br />Featuring their newest creation - Magma S\'more Toast ($14.90). Think flowing chocolaty lava with melted BBQ-ed marshmallows 😻 Good for sharing as its on the sweet side and might get a little too heavy!
Each cut is well buttered and toasted so they are all crispy 😍 Between the crust, generous speculaas cookie crumble gives a nice crunch and sweetness to each bite. My favorite part has to be the matcha ice cream and sauce. They have intense matcha taste like the matcha desserts I had in Japan during my holiday 😋 I just love them so much I finished the dish myself when everyone else gave up already 😂 Definitely a dish for sharing though, surely can\'t have it alone.
and finally a decent waffle from them! the previous one we had were either sour or barely tasted like the flavour they were supposed to be.
👅🤗🤰🏻

Had a sugar rush right at the first sight 👀. For this kind of dessert I feel that the taste of the chocolate sauce will be the determining factor. Luckily it tasted fine! 🙂 and the best part will always be the melted marshmallow 💕\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />💲: $14.2\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#TQF #eatsingaporeTQF #eatsg #sgfoodies #sgfoodstagram #foodgrammers #sgfoodgrammers #instafoodies #instafood #jktfoodies #desserts #desserstagram #sgdessert #archipelagocreamery #sgcafe #toast #chocolatetoast #charcoaltoast #icecream #chocolate #burpple #sweettooth #eatoutsg
Second time here @archipelagocreamery and we got to enjoy double treats of Peanut butter &amp; jelly + Strawberry cheesecake ice-creams. Super smooth &amp; delicious!

Have always heard good things about this place from my uni mates and finally went to try it last Saturday. We had a double scoop ($7.50) of dark chocolate and mixed berries flavours and were surprised by its rich and creamy flavour! You could also taste the berries bits as well. Definitely heading back again #burpplecheapngood
love the baileys ice cream!! damn good 🤣

Chilling out in a lovely and quiet place.
Great atmosphere, clean decor. If I were an NTU student, I\'d come here more often (lol).

• Finally visited the cafe near my school, and luckily I\'m not disappointed by their toast. Right proportion of ice cream to toast. The bread was toasted well and well spread with butter. Service was mediocre, and a bit slow considering we were the only customers in the cafe. \n<br />Many thanks to my hand model @deborahwjy 👋🏼\n<br />#shibuyahoneytoast #shibuyatoast #dessertporn #dessert #toast #icecream #archipelagocreamery
