Spongy soft layers sandwiched between strips of Gula Melaka cream and Gula Melaka Glaze. Executed to a T. Sinpopo is known for introducing a local twist to most of their items and this sat well on our palates. \n<br />Although, service and attention to guests definitely needs to be improved by a notch. This one\'s for your if you\'re a sweet tooth!
It was not only creative but delicious. 2nd visit to #sinpopobrand this time the service weren\'t as friendly and enthusiastic as last month. And the wagyu beef on my favorite Hor Fun  is overcooked and dry #burpple
This is the BOMB for me! Instead of the usual wok hei, the noodles is deep fried.. more closer with Thai\'s dish. The beef is soft and succulent.. no to mention the beautiful broth.. it was love at first taste!!
There you have:\n<br />2 rice\n<br />Sambal chilli \n<br />Sambal fish balls\n<br />Rojak\n<br />Potato wedges in curry\n<br />Ma Ling luncheon meat \n<br />Prawn Paste Chicken \n<br />Pork slices
The sambal and the ma ling (luncheon meat) crisps were really good.
The desserts here all have a local twist, including a Pandan tart (really good) and a sugee cake.  The sweetness really packs a punch though so come in groups to share.
Differs from the usual brunch that is usually served in cafes . Modern local food is more of their speciality as they tweet their recipe to meet the growing demands of photogenic customer crowd. Nasi Lemak set for 2 have Six different ingredients for you to accompany with the fragrant coconut rice. Addictive luncheon chips üëçüèªüëçüèª is my favourite choice followed by the curry potatoesüòÇ 
Nasi lemak is one of our national dish in Singapore, and recently crowned as one of the 10 healthiest breakfast internationally by Time Magazine (and surprised all of us). It literally means oily rice in Malay. But it aren\'t actually oily, it\'s made with coconut milk and pandan, so the rice is actually very fragrant.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />At Sinpopo, the spread of the nasi lemak set is pretty impressive. The sides pictured in the centre are - har cheong kai chicken, curry potatoes, luncheon meat crisps, deep fried pork chop, rojak and sambal fishballs. My favourite would be the luncheon meat crisps, which were almost as thin as potato chips. It\'s so thin that it didnt feel as oily as other fried luncheon meat, yet it felt meaty enough.\n<br />üî∏\n<br />Free flow of the rice and sambal chilli, which came with ikan bills. But be prepared as its heavily seasoned, we felt thirsty the whole day. There are also service lapses as mentioned in my post just before this. Otherwise, this is a decently priced nasi lemak set at $25++.

Creamy crabmeat stuffed in crispy wanton skins served with a house dip #sinpopobrand #local #fusion
It was not bad but nothing stood out. Nice atmosphere though! Oh and the horlicks &amp; maltesers shake was quite nice.
Not a single part of this Nasi Lemak set fail to impress me. Rojak coleslaw was unique in taste. Fish cake with sambal chilli that was made in house. Old school potato curry. Crispy pork cutlet. Fragrant HJK chicken. Thinly sliced Maling luncheon chips. #burpple
$15. Popped them all faster than I could say PARTY IN MY MOUTH. These light crumbly cookies with savoury fragrance from the salted egg / curry leaves, were so small-sized that you wouldn\'t even notice how much you\'ve eaten until it\'s gone. Genius. next CNY I know where I\'m heading to get some cookies. 
I love variety so this was perfect. Pork chop, har jeong gai (on point! Crispy and tasty, but a little too salty), Rojak slaw (definitely my favorite out of it all), Ma Ling Luncheon Crisp (so shiok I was sad when I finished it), sambal fishball and curry with potato. Sambal chilli was so darn good. Served with soft boiled egg. Coconut rice was very fragrant, and we finished a plate so fast we asked for a second helping. Portion was sufficient though not a lot, so it\'s not exactly cheap at $25 but we will definitely come back again for this! üòã \n<br />Give the refreshing Sng Muay Pop ($5: plum juice ice spheres with lime and soda) a try too! Perfect for this crazy weather. 
With the durian season long over, we can barely satisfy our durian cravings. Wasn\'t I glad to see durian pengat ($9)! It came with browned butter croutons (some great textures goin\' on) and coconut ice cream - a rich, silky dessert that sure was pleasing.
I really enjoyed the tender, juicy pork chop ($20) that went well with the gorgeously roasted potato chunks (way too little, unfortunately) and mild curry sauce! My only gripe is that it was a little too fatty, but oh well üòú
Nice retro environment! Fish ball is one of the must eat! Great place for couple and beer lovers! 1-for-1 beer after 6 pm
The set consists of a few sides like (top left: fired pork chop, shrimp paste chicken, crispy luncheon meat, sambal chilli with anchovies, curry potato, sambal fish cake and rojak (fruit salad)) serve with free-flow of fragrant coconut rice. #cuisineparadisebento #sinpopo #burpple \n<br />Verdict: sambal chilli is good but slightly salty. Out of all the sides, shrimp paste chicken is the best.
And it\'s awesome! This Nasi Lemak Set for 2 ($25) at Sinpopo Brand could easily pass off as something for 3. \n<br />It was also a sampler platter of their starters: Rojak Slaw, Ma Ling Luncheon Crisp, Sambal Fishballs, Roasted Potatoes &amp; Curry, Har Jeong Kai Wings and Chargrilled Pork Chop. \n<br />The best thing is the rice is free flow, that is if you could even finish the rest in the first place. Two thumbs up!
A great twist on our classic local food :) Wish the coconut rice portion was bigger though! Iced kopi with vanilla ice cream was rich üëç
Really love the ambience of the place with those classic oldies playing in the background!üé∂ Definitely top my list right now!üòÅ Will definitely be back for their food since I haven\'t try yet but the ambience already caught me!üòä\n<br />‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ
The server seemed to be really experienced with embarrassing people like me as she got ready and asked if we needed her to drizzle it for us. AND SHE DID IT SO NICELY and PATIENTLY!
Do I even make sense?
Lunch date with hubby at Sinpopo. This sweet addiction was the best. Looking forward to the whole cake soon. $7/slice, $28 for a whole cake (small)
If it\'s even possible, my second visit was better than the first. A chewy, moist, yet paradoxically light cake, assertively sweetened, and glazed with the most rich and decadent gula melaka sauce. What better way to commemorate the jubilee weekend than by celebrating small local successes?
It\'s a gula melaka cake. I was drawing up a list of hipster ingredients &amp; dishes and GM was at the top of the list. But. That doesn\'t make this cake any less fudgey and awesome. I like it that its just sweet enough, and doesn\'t make you feel like dying after finishing it. I\'d be back for another slice. #burpple #sinpopo
After 2 misses, I finally got to try the much raved about Gula Melaka cake. It was chewy, dense, fine-crumbed and boldly flavoured with the addictive palm sugar. In fact it tasted deceivingly similar to the traditional È©¨ÊãâÁ≥ï, just a wee kueh-er. Topped with the stickiest gula melaka glaze, this made for a wonderful tea cake.
This entirely redefines what a burger is. Huge, crispy, absolutely delish fried chicken patty, sandwiched between two fluffy soft buns. The shrimp paste batter was super yummy, and ohmygosh the buns were one of the fluffiest I\'ve tried. Only downside is I\'ve been stuck in a food coma since noon today; so guys, be warned. The calorie-ridden burger is mad addictive.
It sounds funky, but the flavours came off surprisingly well. Dug into the intensely flavoured kaya custard and a layer of fresh sliced bananas greeted us. The toasted croutons I found odd though. It would\'ve been better if the textural crunch came from the torched sugar instead, which was unfortunately soggy and limp.
Pair this sweet with Sinpopo\'s solid Teh Tarik. Lovely place away from the crowd to chill and unwind.
We hope in and give a try for this Nyonya Style Nasi Lemak. At first, we saw that the portion was quite small,guess what, both of us ended up with \"full tank\" Haha.  Nice environment and nice food there.  I will definitely return back for their desserts!  And also because of the servers were kinda friendly. \n<br />From left Vertically, \n<br />Curry Potato,Sambal Fish Cake, In-house Rojak, Pork Belly, Prawn Paste Chicken Wings, Fried Luncheon Crisps, and The Sambal (Sambal lover you can ask for unlimited servings) üòãüòã\n<br />#sgcafe#sggoodfood#burpple#sgfood#sgcafehopping
$25, free flow of rice + sambal, and a little bit of everything. Truly worth it!
I must be a horfun purist because I wasn\'t sold by the crispy, fried strips of horfun. I thought it took away from the flavour of the rice noodle, replacing it with a sense of crunching on something too oily. The beef was amazing, though, tender and melt-in-the-mouth. 
Comprise of few layers. It might not be too sweet if you didnt eat the dark brown layer too much.
If you are looking for a fried chicken burger this absolutely hits the spot. Crispy, not too oily with the salty Har Cheong Kai kick. Thumbs up :) 
This is a monster nasi lemak for 2. It consists of two serving of nasi lemak and 6 sides: curried potatoes, sambal sotong balls, fried spam, roast pork (siew yoke), salad tossed rojak style with sweet sauce and har chiong kai. Really hearty and sinful, but definitely pleases the palate. My fave sides are the curried potatoes and siew yoke. The rojak salad is an interesting twist, i find it welcoming, but some might not enjoy that combination with the rest of the sides. I feel that the nasi lemak could be better. Otherwise, value-for-$$. Also, try the sng buay pop and fake birdnest drink!
A good combination of unusual three flavours for cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Although kaya n banana are overpowering, overall I love it ‚ô°
A generous slice of salmon coated on top with dao jiao, a yummy bean paste. Comes on a bed of glass noodles, which was quite light but balances out the heavy salmon taste well. And it was very pretty!
Really yummy- The durian was super creamy and fresh, and the coconut ice-cream added an uniquely refreshing aftertaste to the dessert. Do try the coconut ice-cream before eating the durian though, as the durian flavour completely drowned out the coconut taste!
$7.50/slice This not photogenic cake looks like \'sam zam barh\'(‰∏âËæ∞ËÇâ) to me, but it\'s not! It\'s sooooooooo soft and defiantly taste better than it look! MUST TRY!
Exactly what it sounds like, a malty Horlicks milkshake topped with crushed Maltesers. I know my boyfriend loves me cos he still let\'s me consume calorie-laden stuff like this despite my ever-expanding waistline. üò£ 
I thought this was overall a really successful interpretation of a local favourite, with soft-centred boiled eggs replacing the usual fried egg/omelette; rojak made with shredded cabbage, slivers of turnip and pineapple in a lipsmacking peanut and shrimp sauce; roast potatoes in vegetable curry; fishballs in sambal belacan; har cheong gai (prawn paste chicken) with a crispy batter that\'s light as panko, instead of the crunchier crust that\'s typical of Chinese zi char stalls; clusters of spam crisps; deep-fried pork belly; sambal ikan bilis with strips of onion. Very scrumptious and filling for two to share! 
Orange kaya pisang creme br√ªl√©e ($7). A local twist to this western dessert. Loved it! And it\'s so huge it\'s good for sharing!
I also bought a gula Melaka cake to bring home for my dad. And headed back here AGAIN for a second round of dessert with @ig_honeybeesweets, @vivienneeluv and @makeyourcaloriescount üòä tummy had a happy day!
Ok, 4th stop is the revamped Sinpopo, looks cooler than last time and more interesting desserts! \n<br />[DURIAN PENGAT S$9] - durian pengat served with browned butter croutons and coconut ice cream. It is so creamy good. 
By far, the most expensive Nasi Lemak I\'d ever had at $25 a set for 2. Coconut milk fragrant rice accompanied by portions of crispy pork, crispy friend luncheon meat, unlimited serving of anchovy sambal, Lemak potato curry, fried fish balls, and cabbage Rojak. The sambal is good, so is the Rojak. A good try for first time visitors. Additional bowl of rice at $3. 
Delightful Ma Ling luncheon meat served with a twist. A portion at $6, it\'s yummy! Super crispy, great appetizer or just snack. 
This caf√© is recommended by my darling~ we were too stuffed from previous meal so we just shared our dessert Gula Melaka Soft Jelly ($8) &amp; drink Sng Muay Pop ($3.9) I\'m not a over-sweet tooth person so I didn\'t really like d dessert. Overall I would like to come again and try their food :)
Sinpopo Brand used to have the vibe of a typical 1950s eatery when it was first launched in 2013. Awfully Chocolate (which owns Sinpopo Brand) had since decided to give Sinpopo Brand a major revamp, injecting a modern vibe to the eatery that reminisces the old days. Gone were the wooden tables and stools, and in its place was cushioned seats and modern yet rustically-designed tables. To fit in with the new direction, most of the original menu items have also been replaced with new ones, featuring a modern approach on local classics. Expect things such as Nasi Lemak Platters (feeds two), Crispy Pork Belly Sandwiches, Har Jeong Kai and Chilled Pandan Souffl√©s amongst other Sinpopo classics such as the Sng Muay Pop and Durian Pengat. Prices may have gone up pretty exorbitantly, but the new direction for the business would attract youngsters who are curious about fusion food to give them a try. Old place, new blood indeed.
Have you seen a Chilled Souffl√© before? Not me; this is the first time I had came across one and I am sold! Served with crumbles, sesame dentelle and almond streusel, the Chilled Pandan Souffl√© tasted really rich and coconut-y with a texture similar to ice-cream but thicker and denser, which went well with the salted crumbles. Sesame dentelle had an old-school flavour that I really liked which seemed to replicate Sesame cookies, though the Almond Streusel seemed mismatched with the rest being a bit bland as well.
New on the revamped menu at Sinpopo Brand. Deep-fried buns with crispy pork belly, wasabi mayo and salsa accompanied with Rojak at the side. Fried buns and deep-fried Pork Belly were crisp, and well matched with the refreshing salsa and the light tinge of numbness that kicked in from the Wasabi Mayo. Rojak was decently sweet-savoury too! An interesting western twist to our local Kong Bak Pau!
New on the menu at the revamped Sinpopo Brand. These Luncheon Crisps came rather unexpected as we were expecting it to look like typical Spam Frites. Mashed before deep-frying, these are incredibly savoury and crispy; a great way to whet the appetite before starting the meal!
Sinpopo used to be the name of an infamous nightclub in the 1950s in Singapore. While there is no sleasiness here at Sinpopo Brand, it attempts to bring out the best of the 50s with its decor and food; posters of food replicating advertisements of the 50s, attendance registers for their menus, old records; you name it, they have it! Songs from that era also transports you back in time; tunes that your parents/grandparents can relate with. Most food items also ring a bell, such as the Ais Bor, but do go for the Kato Rice (Scissors Cut Curry Rice) and the Pulot Hitam with Coconut Ice-Cream, both of which are what they are known for!
I feel so comfortable here, guess I\'m really ancient :/ #vsco #vscocam #foodporn
Had Ais Bor, Pulut Hitam with Coconut Ice Cream and Durian Pengat. Wash it down with the fake birds\'nest drink. 
#FoodHoppingSG - Ice Kacang in a shape of a ball! Blog updated. Www.everyday-im-travelling.blogspot.com
Great place for local sweet treats but at a steeper value. Nevertheless great place to bring the mommies and grannies along! #nostalgia 
Ice bor, gula melaka jelly and sng muay pop. Love the lychee pop inside the ice bor. Ending the week with something sweet üçßüçßüçß
very average..... zzzzz... go to Punggol nasi lemak instead (Tj Katong road)
For those of us who are familiar with kato rice and the yummilicious taste of our childhood kinda food, try Sinpopo. The curry veg was cold, otherwise would have been close to 10/10. Verdict? Food: 8/10. Ambience: 9/10
Love how I could sip coffee with dear hubby on old furniture that resembled my favorites in my great grandparents\' house. Love chilling out to old Chinese songs that brought me back to my distant childhood when I would listen to my parents\' cherished collection on their vintage phonograph turntable all day. Felt at home instantly. #sinpopobrand#sinpopo

Cottony Pandan souffl√© with coconut foam, almond streusel and sesame dentelle. The Pandan absolutely popped in the mouth.

üòÜ This cake wasn\'t that amazing, the breezy touch of Gula Melaka only present in the sticky glaze atop the cake. Then again, the caramelized sugar lacked the smoky depth of a good quality gula melaka. Rather one dimensional if you ask me„ÄÇ

Tea? For starters, #sambal #fishballs and #luncheoncrisps. Main was #prawnpastechicken #burger. And not forgetting desserts - #pandansouffle and #Nutella #tart. #cafehoppingsg #sinpopobrand #gardeniamakan #makan #foodposting #Singapore #burpple

Remember this? @gsytingco #sinpopo#nasilemak platter, #luncheon crisps, crispy #porkbelly sandwich was so sinful!
But the salmon itself was good. #sinpopo #burpple #pepperminter25 #pepperminterfoodadventure
