Besides retaining its signatures, they introduced a few new additions to the menu too.\n<br />.\n<br />They currently have a lunch set promo on chilli crab spaghetti. Oh! Do also have their Shiobak Aglio which is my favourite! For non-spicy eaters, the Ponzu Soya Cod will be D perfect choice.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @froth.sg and @brandcellar for the invite! And special thanks to @ahsoh.sg for making the arrangement possible.
Featuring French Toast Waffle ($16.90) to welcome my favourite weekend! \n<br />Just the name alone excites me, with both of my favourite French toast and waffle combined as 1 dessert! Overall dessert tasted more like French toast in a waffle presentation; so expect it to be denser on the inside with crispy crust. Doused with condensed milk and cereals, it was also accompanied with a scoop of toasted marshmallow ice cream 😍\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Featuring my favourite Five Spice Wagyu Patty Burger ($34.90) that is derived from traditional Ngoh Hiang. \n<br />Instead of the usual minced pork used in Ngoh Hiang, Wagyu patty is wrapped with beancurd skin and deep-fried before sandwiching it with toasted soft brioche burger buns. Following close to the recipe of Ngoh Hiang, you can find bits of chestnuts that provided the overall crunch! \n<br />Thanks @froth.sg and @brandcellar for the invitation!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
One of the mains that\'s worth trying is the Ponzu Soya Cod ($35.90), a cod fillet cooked in a 45 degrees Celsius water bath for 50 minutes before it goes to the pan for a ponzu and sesame soya glaze and of cause to get that all important crispy skin. Served with sides of wasabi edamame puree, smoked mash, baby peaches (unassuming but damn sweet) and bok choy, the fish takes the spotlight with its delicate texture and creamy taste profile.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @froth.sg for the hosting and @BrandCellar for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Froth\n<br />Address: 2, Finlayson Green, Ascott Raffles Place, Level 2, Singapore 049247
Imagine deep fried waffles (coated with French toast batter) topped with fried banana (goreng pisang), toasted mashmallow ice cream and drizzled with generous amount of condensed milk. 😍😍😍😍 Easily one of my favourite item on the new menu of @froth.sg!😋👍🏻 .\n<br />If you\'re unaware, Froth has shifted to Ascott Raffles Place!😊
Froth had moved into CBD area! No longer offering cafe food, they had ventured into a creative fusion menu selection. Might be on a steeper end as it now targets the working adults plus no lunch set menu available at this point.
A spin off the usual hot wings that most places do, the Doritos Crust Winglets ($16.90++) is a made up of confit boneless wings (best for people who hate deboning) &amp; coated with spicy Doritos chips! Perfect pairing with booze in hand 🍻 \n<br />Thanks to @jacqsowhat for bringing me along &amp; #brandcellar for hosting us!
The Ponzu Soya Cod $35.90 was one of the best among the rest of the funky fusion dishes, that I find them lacking with flavours hopelessly jumbled. •
Waffles are first made using the waffle iron, then dipped into the french toast batter before being deep fried. This method would allow the waffle to soak up the batter and results in a more bread-liked and denser texture on the inside. The deep frying definitely won my heart as it results in a very fragrant outer skin. This is paired with some toasted marshmallow ice cream, cereal flakes and fried bananas!
Cod is prepared using the sous vide method — placed in a 45 degrees water bath for 50 minutes, before marinating it with ponzu and sesame soya glaze and skin is charred to achieve a crispy crackling. The sous vide technique ensures a consistent cook throughout the fish meat while retaining the sweetness of the cod, beautifully paired with a crispy skin. This was my favorite dish of the night!
The seafood tom yum risotto looked absolutely stunning with its rich yellow colours complemented with the fresh seafood. The risotto is made with both pumpkin and tom yum, marrying both creamy and tangy flavors together with basil leaves but the taste did not sit well with me. The only consolation of this dish is the freshness of the seafood grilled with a charred taste.
Crispy squid ink brioche bun sandwiching lobster chunks drenched in a squid ink mentaiko sauce. There wasn’t enough lobster in the roll which made it hard to finish. We enjoyed the fries way more.
Deboned winglets deep fried and tossed with a generous amount of spicy doritos chips. This surely does look very appetizing with the golden brown exterior. However, the taste seemed to be a little lacking here — short of that satisfaction you get from fried chicken, perhaps due to the usage of winglets with lesser meat. Chicken thigh might be a better option!
Foie gras done two way here — hot and cold. The hot is made of pan seared foie gras over a toasted butter brioche with pomegranate and truffle honey apple reduction. Foie gras was smooth and creamy with a nice sear over a fragrant toast and a sweet tasting sauce. A common combination that is hard to go wrong. The cold is made of a chilled foie gras wrapped with a liquid centre of apple and kiwi puree over crushed sable, crunchy celery and topped with granny smith slaw to add to its texture. The chilled foie gras tasted like a foie gras terrine, albeit softer and not as thick as I would like it to be. The puree and apple slaw did give a zesty taste to it but I prefer the hot version!
Sharing their Cheesy Lobster Sandwich, topped with mentai mayo and tobiko. Upgrade to their truffle fries to level up the pleasure. #burpple
Love the ice-cream! Chocolate sways towards dark rather than milk chocolate. Sprinkles of chocolate/oreo bits makes it interesting to the taste buds. Waffle was average, too thick and dense in my opinion.
One of the better churros in Singapore! Crispy on the outside and soft (but not sticky) on the inside. Ample sugar and cinnamon and thus it is great on its own even without the sauce. But the sauce is a plus, especially if you like Ferrero Roche :)
Decided to settle lunch here @ Froth before it moves out end of this month to Raffles Place. Not the ultimate best but the homemade chilli crab sauce was well-balanced. Most importantly, I like that it was not ketchup-ish. 👍 
Back at Froth for this mega Cheesy Lobster Sandwich. The slipper lobster chunks were drenched in mentai mayonnaise and cheese then topped with tobiko (flying fish roe). It can be jelak for one to finish but thankfully this was shared between two so I quite enjoyed the whole rich creamy flavour. The fluffy yet solid bread was filling enough, but I just can\'t stop eating the crisp and aromatic truffle fries. 😋
Strong flavours, crispy roasted pork belly and candied bacon. This was a winner for me. #frothsg #burpple
Froth whips up great tasting Asian Fusion dishes like chilli Crab pasta and also the great tasting lobster sandwich that reminds me of sushi with the added fish roe. It is a good place to have a casual dinner date. The food not only look good but they taste great too. Popular with the working crowd and prices are reasonable. Check out\n<br /> http://theaugbunnies.blogspot.com/2016/04/food-review-froth-middle-road-big-hotel.html
Boneless and juicy confit winglets with mild spicy crispy Doritos crust on the outside. A fantastic dish for junk food and meat lovers like us! 😍
I love matcha, beef, pork floss, poached egg and furikake but this Matcha Rice with Beef proved that some things are just not meant to be together. 
😅 This is a taro waffles with ice cream from @froth.sg. The ice creams were surprisingly good!😋👍🏻 There\'s also a pancake version (taro pancakes!!😍) which I think is better than the waffles. 👌🏻 Go try it if you\'re a big fan of taro!😊
Generous serving of seafood but risotto could be more flavourful with richer seafood taste. #burpple
Who can resist such a sweet savory combination?
Wayyyy too oily and the fried chicken had more batter than meat :(
The best dish that afternoon :) Pork belly eggs ben with salted egg yolk hollandaise. Didn\'t taste any salted egg yolk but the pork belly was well marinated and went well with the buttery hollandaise and English muffins.
Yam and sweet potato fries were unfortunately bland and hard, truffle fries were okay. Chilli crab pasta with mantou was pretty good!
Broiche cube that has a scoop of ice cream stuffed within, with flavour of your choice. Topped with strawberries, fried bananas, fried mars bars and speculoos angliss. |
Do you? 😝😝 One of my favourites will be from @froth.sg! Usually I go for their banana waffles but they were sold out that say so I went with the buttermilk waffles and the classic pairing with chocolate ice cream! #burpple #frothsg #waffleporn #dessertporn
Rosti and fried chicken, which is very different from what we usually have. The shredded potato is almost like noodles! I actually quite like this version as well. 😌👌🏻 But the mixed fries or yam, sweet potatoes and potatoes still my fav.😁
We chose vanilla bean for this, and top up for an additional scoop of earl grey ice-cream. \n<br />Again, they forgot our additional scoop of ice-cream :( but we were pleasantly surprised when they served us our additional scoop topped with raspberries and biscuit stick a while later :) The taro taste is infused into the waffles, and I kinda like it. Waffle texture is good, but I wish it\'s more buttery. Their earl grey ice-cream is rich and has a distinct earl grey taste, a tad too heavy for baby but just right for me. \n<br />All in all, I think Froth serves interesting and relatively good food with their contemporary Asian fusion concept. My only gripe is their lackluster service level. Looking forward to improved service level, and we will be back to try more of their interesting dishes!
Filled with chunks of slipper lobster, mentai mayo, cheese and tobiko on toasted bread, it\'s definitely satisfying to sink your teeth into this combination! But I find the meat less firm as compared to Boston lobster. \n<br />Fries tossed in truffle oil is surprisingly fragrant, made better with its sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top. \n<br />As much as their lobster sandwich is good, their service leave much to be desired. They have forgotten baby\'s lobster sandwich despite us checking with them twice. After a long wait (with me almost finishing my food), his lobster sandwich was served, but his fries was served cold. :(
Lovely presentation, premium bacon bits and a surprising egg in that creamy goodness. 
big portion of goodness. consisting of truffle fries, sweet potato fries and yam fries. would be nice if there are some dips to go with.
somehow a bad day to visit. quite a few items not available. my siobak was wayyyy overdone. no bak kwa as stated in menu (not informed too) \n<br />a tad disappointed for $20.90
Cafe week will be held on 10th to 13th December and 17th to 20th December. You will be able to browse through the participating cafes menus on Nomnom’s website and make dining reservations.
$18.90, decided on this because of the truffle mash. Truffle taste was quite strong but the mash wasn\'t very smooth. Chicken looked dry so we didn\'t expect much but turned out quite alright, juicy inside and actually crispy. 
$20.90. Aglio olio was not bad, nicely tossed with typical garlic chilli parsley, but the sio bak was a disappointment. No crackling skin - it was hard to chew. Loved the homemade bakkwa (candied bacon?) though. 
these banana waffles stayed true to its name, with a bold banana flavor in the batter. the sea salt caramel ice cream went well with the taste. (only drawback was the texture of the waffles, which were a tad too dense and chewy)
Love the generous portion of crab and bits of eggs. The the addition of the mantou was interesting too. Would have preferred more sauce though. There wasn\'t enough to toss the spaghetti with and definitely didn\'t have much left to dip that golden bun. Plus the sauce was on the sweet side. Didn\'t quite work for me.
Too darn good. Not going back to mushroom soups without truffle from now. Bye.
Runny egg. Crispy bacon pieces. Flavourful soup. Presented like a work of art. Major party in my mouth❤😍
Love how their runny egg was hidden inside that caught me in surprise. With the crispy side of the bacon bits and a well-garnished dish that I would recommend as starters!
.
It\'s a Friday again, and this means that it\'s time for our Weekend brunch! Here\'s an option from @frothsg - French Toast Cube ($19.90), probably the epitome of sinning.
This waffle has taro on it and overloaded with more taro inside of it. I\'m already in heaven.
Very dangerous fun-sized churros. I unknowingly polished off almost half the basket on my own. Wish the sauce was thicker or more chocolatey though. Sis said the waffles was good but honestly, I was too swept away by the churros to remember much about the waffles. 🙊
Couldn\'t really taste the green tea, but the pork floss and furikake gave a crunchy texture to the whole dish. Oh, and the beef was damn nice, medium rare goodness 😍
☺️ .\n<br />Front: a beautiful garden of escargots. Back: my favourite trio fries (potato, sweet potato, yam).
Classic mid western American. No more risotto for brunch weekend menu
My cholesterol levels are screaming.
Realised I don\'t like Tom Yum pastas but still ok thought 
Now, will someone hit me up with a white chocolate matcha latte right now? Or just hit me with some books also can.
Chicken battered with salted egg and then send for deep frying. Not forgetting the sweet homemade potato jam. Makes me feel like licking the whole plate.
TGIF folks. something new coming soon on @froth.sg  new menu.
Very much like their taro waffle. I love their candied yam on top of it, got me hooked. This is their new weekend brunch menu. Whose excited to try already?
Throwing back a [Taro Pancake Stack topped with Caramelised Taro S$16.90] on the new brunch menu starting this weekend! Pancakes are stuffed with taro and drizzled generously with the same taro sauce for their waffles. There is also Nutella &amp; Caramelised Banana, Speculoos &amp; Caramelised Apples, Chicken Ham Cheese &amp; Egg pancakes to choose from, at this same price.
cuz I\'m dying in this heat. somebody turn down the temperature ?
I loved the CARAMELIZED taro bits that topped the pancake stack and the ones studded within the pancake! Much effort, but the texture of the pancakes felt a little... Flat and very much like my attempt to make my own pancakes from a premix.
The chicken was tender and boneless. The doritoes were slightly spicy and went well with the combination of chicken. Will order this the next time again !
Mentai mayo with chunks of the lobster flesh. simply delicious. The bread was crispy outside and soft on the inside. Fries were salted to a nice level. Will order this the next time !
Too much potatoes for me! The truffle fries is nice thou.
Earl grey ice cream was nice but the taro syrup was slightly too sweet. 
|\n<br />Taro stuffed pancakes topped with taro sauce and sweetened yam bits. The taro sauce is the same one that they used for their signature taro waffles. Overall, these dense and chewy pancakes could have been fluffier imo 🍴 #frothsg
I know of people who are ok with eating cold food but #sorrynotsorry that\'s not me. The yam layers in between made me crave for better yam and I think mr bean would do way better if they come up with a yam bean pancake.
Thanks @froth.sg for hosting us! \n<br />#froth #frothsg #cafehopping #burpple #exsgcafes #sgcafe #sgcafefood
My Favourite dish so far is this savory sweet [Rosti &amp; Fried Chicken S$20.90] - salted egg battered fried chicken and homemade potato jam (made of potato skin). Was expecting the potato jam to be savory but it\'s sweet. Not a bad thing for a sweet-tooth me 🤗
It comes in bite size pieces, with a delicious hazelnut chocolate sauce 😊
Roasted pork belly, homemade bak kwa, olive oil, garlic, chilli and parsley. Very flavourful! It looks small but is actually quite filling.
Siobak slurping shiokness with this yummy Siobak Aglio Olio.😋 The fat slices of roast pork, together with bak kwa, were not only a welcoming sight, but also added a rich flavour to this dish. Simply done but oh-so-shiok!
The signature Cheesy Lobster Sandwich.
This year\'s Cafe Week will be held from 10th to 13th December 2015 and 17th to 20th December 2015. Mark down in your calendar! \n<br />Froth is well-known for their taro waffle and now they have came out with another taro dessert, White Chocolate Taro Lava Cake served with homemade taro ice cream. If you are a sucker for taro, you won\'t want to miss this. \n<br />More details on Cafe Week 2015 will be up on @nomnom.sg in early November.
One of the must try is the Waffles with Taro flavored ice cream and a side of sea salt caramel ice cream. Had other dishes like Doritos Crust Winglets and The Club Sandwich as well. Service was friendly and welcoming! 
The taro sauce was thick and nice (though the gloopy outlook was a tad turn-offish); the taro-flavoured waffles were fragrant, delish, and sported a beautiful purple hue, though too chewy and wet for my preference; and the deceptively cute taro ball was just gross. In short: love the flavours, texture however sucked. That, and the ice cream (sea salt caramel &amp; earl grey) were so icy and just bad.
I\'m not sure if I\'m suay or this is the norm. This is my second time I visited Froth and both time I had a ultra long wait of more than 1 hour. They had so many walk in customers but they chose to close half of the area for a birthday party celebration on a weekend! I would suggest that u call prior visiting this cafe. Back to the food! Despite the long wait, we still enjoyed our food. Ordered the Taro waffles with earl grey ice cream and Red Velvet waffles with salted caramel ice cream. Personal preferences, I love the rich earl grey ice cream. Taro waffles is still the best. Wanted to try the banana waffles but not available for the day. Mixed fries comprising the sweet potatoes fries, truffle fries and yam fries. Felt that the truffle could be richer. Spam fries totally can\'t go wrong. Crispy enough! The chocolate cake was fudgey and most importantly rich chocolatey taste! All in all 7 people, we spent about $17/pax (including our own beverage). 
Toasted foccacia and mantou are wonderful touches to a tasty, spicy and generous helping bowl of steaming clam soup. Must try!
Because one scoop is never enough.😁 On a side note, didn\'t know today is Chinese Valentine\'s Day (七夕节/乞巧节)! So happy valentines @post_eatz and to everyone too~😁💕
Squid ink &amp; truffle mushroom risotto. Flavorful and rice cooked perfectly. And it\'s so unique to be able to order both on the same plate. Will be back to try the pumpkin and sweet corn risotto! 
The ambience s great, there is quality service, decor is exquisite, has one of the most interesting menus and full marks for all the dishes we have ordered: Fried Chicken Steak with truffle mash, Carbonara, Mixed Mushroom Tempura fascinatingly presented, Truffle Fries, Pan-fried crispy skin Salmon steak, Cheesy Lobster Sandwich, and Taro Waffles with Earl Grey Ice-cream. Must try for everything and I will be back for the other items on the menu!
With the mixed reviews, I just had to try Froth\'s signature waffle which tasted pretty good to me. As a fan of taro/yam, the sauce and waffles went well together but note a more chewy texture with the taro incorporated batter. The earl grey ice cream was however the highlight with a slight sweetness and floral fragrance.
Ordered the Buttermilk Waffles paired with decadent chocolate ice cream ($10.90) from @froth.sg to end off our final lunch together with @alvinswiftakes as colleagues before we part ways - for now. #burpple #frothsg #farewell
Opted for the plain buttermilk waffle this time with salted caramel ice cream. Preferred this basic version over other more elaborate options! ($12.50)
Located along middle road, it\'s actually below the road level. There wasn\'t any signboards outside, we almost missed it thinking it was just a hotel beneath, till I glimpsed the familiar settings of the cafe below just beside the hotel reception area. (good to get yourself prepared with investigations of the place first huh hahaha) Reached at 11.30am and left at 12+ when it was slowly filling up (like a quarter or less) Ordered a cuppa and the highly raved taro waffles! Paired with sea salt caramel ice cream. Wrong choice as I find the flavour of the ice cream too overpowering and just didn\'t click with my taste buds. Decided to order an additional scoop of their earl grey ice cream to go with the remaining waffles.. and it was good! Not too overpowering, not too sweet but just really fragrant and smooth. Total bill was about $25. Verdict: Really love the taro waffles with earl grey ice cream 😍 so if you happen to be a taro lover too, just head there straight, and don\'t turn back. There\'s no turning back afterwards.
😌 I\'m be at AMK HUB Fairprice Xtra later at 1pm. Come say hi if you\'re there!😊
One of their signature dessert is their Taro Waffles and well... Honestly it was just mediocre. But if you are a fan of Taro, you might like it just little better.
We waited over 1 hr (7.30pm to 8.45pm) for our main course to be served. Waiters checked several times but inavail. had Yuan Yang Risotto: Squid Ink Risotto and Truffle Mushroom Risotto, and Carbonara. The truffle mushroom risotto was sour but the enoki tempura and calamari are nice. Squid ink pasta was overpowered by the sour risotto. Carbonara was a little watery. Honestly, disappointing experience. 
Quite disappointing. The sauce did not taste like chilli crab and the pasta overcooked.
For a non-soup fan, I really enjoyed it. Flavourful, great texture and not too salty. Nice.
When I see this on the menu. My system goes into excitement overdrive!! What we ordered was Taro Waffles with chocolate and earl grey ice-cream. The quality of the ice-cream is equally outstanding! You should have a try ! 😍
Food here is really expensive and service is rather slow though the waiters are really attentive !  Prawn aglio olio was really good! 5 huge tiger prawns! 😛
Spam Fries w Truffle Mayo. Perfect for a snack or with 🍻! The ones here aren\'t too salty or oily, coupled with the perfect combination of truffle mayo 😉
Chocolate sauce in the waffle was crispy. Ice cream was really nice, it has a light salty taste at first and sweet after that. Marshmallows were the add on point as I love it! However, the portion was not very big but we couldn\'t finish it as it was too sweet. Rating : 3.9/5
the taro (waffle batter + sauce + taro balls) was unexpectedly delicious, and went really well with the earl grey!! thank God we chose the right ice cream flavor :-)
. Bananas were actually mashed &amp; mixed with the batter. Topped with bananas &amp; icecream, the texture was not what i prefer. Plus point...nice rustic plating  #waffles #dessertlovers #dessert #sgfoodie #foodstagram #burpple #openricesg @frothsg
Taro Sauce, Taro Ball and taro waffles.  Additionally, cute server there, keep a lookout y\'all.
♚Taro Waffles w Sea Salt Caramel Ice-Cream♚
The presentation surprised us but not the taste. It was just as ordinary as its name on the menu. Note that the white asparagus is raw -- don\'t be fooled.
They were not really what I was expecting of fries as the texture felt baked and not fried. Soft to the bite but not soggy with an interesting sweetie seasoning. #sweetpotatofries #burpple
Had the red velvet waffles with Earl Grey ice-cream #burpple #redvelvet #waffles
😋\n<br />1. Mixed fries - taro / sweet potatoes / truffle fries \n<br />2. Mixed mushroom tempura \n<br />3. Yuan Yang risotto - pumpkin + truffled mushroom\n<br />4. Cheesy lobster sandwich\n<br />//////////////\n<br />MUST TRY: taro fries and tempura mushroom! 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋 I like how the menu at Froth stands out from other cafes!👍🏻\n<br />Read more about it on my dayre. 😊
/ earl grey ice cream! Even has banana chunks in the waffle mmmm. ORDER THIS 
😍 We paired it with sea salt caramel and earl grey ice creams. So good!😋 If only every Saturday is spent like this. 😌👫 @post_eatz
Besides the mini marshmallows, this did not really remind me of s\'mores. The waffles here were crunchier than the taro and red velvet waffles though! This came with a sweet creamy sauce, reminiscent of melted marshmallows so I\'ll give it to them. We chose the Earl grey ice-cream to have with this, and the ice-cream was good. It had a prominent Earl grey flavour! :)
Like the Taro Waffles, the waffles here were nice and crisp, and really fragrant as well. They were drizzled with a really yummy cream cheese sauce that had a hint of coconut milk. Yum!
Very fragrant waffles topped with blobs of taro paste and drizzled with a vibrant purple taro sauce. The waffles are good. Light and crisp, and fluffy inside. This comes with a scoop of ice-cream - we chose the salted caramel flavour, which was alright but not impressive.
Generous bowl of crunchy fries, generously garnished with Parmesan and herbs and *truffle oil*. I really like how crunchy the fries were! The truffle aroma here wasn\'t the most prominent I\'ve had, but it was good enough.
Definitely for yam lover! Great combination with their Earl Grey icecream that goes really well with the taro waffles!
Love this lobster sandwich - generous quantity of lobster meat and the taste reminds me of Japanese sushi.
Finally got my paws on this. \n<br />Purple taro sweetness - creamy and tart. Oh so good :)\n<br />The taro is infused into the waffles as well. The waffles was chewy. Good enough to eat on its own. \n<br />But any self-proclaimed dessert lover would know better than to skip the fragrant earl grey ice cream. \n<br />Monster turns into purple taro Dino! \n<br />I love you. You love me. We are one big family. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
Waffles - pretty normal but taro waffles?! Kinda disappointed when the waffle was just drizzled with taro sauce. It was an okay lah for me! Perhaps they can explore making taro infused waffle??
Loved the taste of Taro on waffles, what a fantastic combination. A pity that the waffles ere a little toooo thick. 
The chicken is tender and quite a unique taste! They seem to have sprinkle some nachos on it ... Not too sure if the taste comes from the nacho or the chicken seasoning itself! But on a whole this is a must try here. I love the texture of this dish! 
I love the tomyum taste but not exactly a fan of shell food! A lot of potential for this dish .... Perhaps the tomyum is too overpowering and the seafood lost their shine in it! You get what I mean... Nice dish but something is just not right! 
I have tried the coffee ice cube in Bangkok! This is pretty interesting. The bottom part is the expresso jelly and topped with milk. You mix them together and you have your coffee! Love this way of drinking coffee surely! 
Club sandwich from @froth.sg with different combinations to have the best of everything you\'d wanna have - there\'s chicken, bacon, wasabi egg mayo all packed in this stacko! 😉 want some? #frothsg
Taro waffles, a specialty here. Aesthetically it is so so pleasing and there is taro balls 😍 my weakness for taro but my only complaint is it is not as crispy on the outside as I wish it to be. And yes, the earl grey ice cream complements with the waffles. 😍
The visit to Froth has to end with their specialty, Taro Waffles with Earl Grey Ice cream. I always love Taro stuff, so this was surprisingly good plus the Earl Grey ice cream goes well with it. 
I\'m never crazy over taro of any sort. But this takes my liking for taro to a new level. Got to give it to them. Really worth ordering taste so good will see myself back at froth for more waffle &amp; food. Oh did I mention mint milo or something along the line. Taste really good and refreshing. 
lovely place for couples, friends gathering and family brunch. absolutely love their carbonara thumbs up not too creamy and who doesn\'t love bacon with their carbonara. reasonable portion. Tom yum seafood risotto creamy if you\'re a creamy Tom yum pasta or risotto fan be sure not to miss this dish. Sides of spams with wasabi mayo.Overall 8/10 
☆☆ Parmesan cheese overload, pretty dry fries. Not the best but cravings satisfied nonetheless.
☆☆☆ Nicely done yam flavored waffles with yam sauce &amp; double scoop Earl Grey &amp; Salted Caramel gelato. Very photogenic plate, however this is too filling. Even too much for two to share.
too scared at how the color looks so neon purple. \n<br />happy weekend folks!
In fact this is the only piece of Bak Kwa I had eaten for this CNY. But U\'m satisfied with this single piece of delicious Bak Kwa!! Yummy yummy!! 😋😋
Please come to froth for their taro waffles!! Every set of waffles comes with a scoop of ice cream. I can\'t really recall what are the flavours available other than earl grey and sea salt caramel because I was struggling between the two lol. 😂 This pleasant twist from typical cafe buttermilk waffles is quite filling by itself so I think it\'s great for sharing. And the earl grey ice cream was so good on its own!! 
I love fries a lot. Froth is introducing their festive menu with this Pork Floss Fries. Once started munching on the fries, I just couldn\'t stop. This is a very big bowl of fries, good for sharing. Happy 3rd day of CNY!!
Extensive menu feature items such as Doritos crust winglets, cheesy lobster sandwich etc. Overall, hit and misses. Review up at jacqsowhat.com
Carbonara pasta with bacon bits, crabmeat pasta and prawn aglio olio🍝
Leaning tower of sandwich (actually it\'s a club sandwich) with herb fries. The club has chicken, bacon, wasabi mayo, anyone would be satisfied with this sandwich.
Quite a disappointment that it does not taste as good as it looks.
Thumbs up for this wonderful waffle! Crispy waffle with taro in between and droplets of taro topped with a scoop of earl grey ice cream. It has a tinge of lavender and flora taste and yet not too sweet. Heavens.
With the right amount of saltiness and a distinct caramel flavour. (You can also choose other ice cream flavours like vanilla, Choc or earl grey if you prefer) \n<br />Friday calls for happy food like this! \n<br />Waiting for my other dinner items to come~ (*´◡｀​*)
Which will you pick? Both are good but \'orh nee\' for me 🙋
Was really looking forward to this but sadly, our waffles contained no taro paste at all. Just looked and tasted like waffles w purple colouring. 
Quite lucky to have tasted these since my friend won complimentary waffles on IG. Waffles were strong with buttermilk aroma but texture-wise this did not really fare too well because it could have been more crispier and the insides seemed to lack fluff. The only thing that really delivered was the Earl Grey Ice-Cream which was smooth and did not taste anywhere near soapy.
These pretty deconstructed fragrant waffles made my day. We loved this, it was crispier than what I expected from other burpplers\' reviews so it was a pleasant surprise. Kinda wish they were more generous with the taro chunks heh. Actually ordered Earl grey ice cream but they had a mix up (someone else\'s order was wrong too tsktsk) but we were ok with the sea salt caramel so yep, creamy ice cream, but taste wise nothing special. I\'ll probably get the Earl grey ice cream when I come back again!
Saw a few versions of it on Instagram and question about it\'s consistency. To our surprise this time, our waffles were stuffed with taro paste in it and still slightly crisp on the surface. 5 ice cream flavours to pick from but vanilla still the best option for flavoured waffle. Other than e violet yam sauce that looks artificial, all is good. Legit 👌
Somewhat deconstructed buttermilk waffle but beautifully presented (scored). Taro paste sandwiched in the waffle with dollops of taro trapped in the squares (scored twice). Paired with earl grey ice cream which had a good balance of sweetness and creamy texture (scored again). I\'ve waffled before I\'ll waffle again and will be back to try the taro cheesecake.
My first mouth was rather overwhelming, with the taro chunks, taro waffle, taro sauce and vanilla ice cream. However the taro waffle by itself is really good - fragrant batter with a mellow taro taste. The waffles lean towards a pancake texture. Don\'t expect it to be the crisp fluffy kind of waffle! The vanilla ice cream was too sweet and artificial for my liking but the texture wasn\'t too bad. Presentation wise, full marks! 
Cheesecake was a bit too dense. The base was a bit thick and overwhelming. Overall it felt like I was eating a ton of bricks. The toasted hazelnut was a nice touch though! 
Bread had a herb like scent which was a bit too strong for me. Lobster wasn\'t the freshest as it was a bit mushy and felt that the cheese could have been more pronounced. 
Risotto was very well made. The Tom yum sauce was a bit too thick and powdery for my liking. Clams and squids were alright but the prawns were downright mushy. 
Chicken was under seasoned - very bland. Fried batter didn\'t have anything special about it. Tasted very pedestrian. They were out of truffle mash so it was replaced with truffle fries which were quite decent. 
Chicken tasted a bit bland and dry. But it was boneless! Felt that the spicy, Mexican-like seasoning robbed the limelight away from the chicken. Could have been delicious if the salt and seasoning was lighter. 
Soup was full of bits of bacon and had only a slight hint of smokiness, which is a good thing as it didn\'t get too jelat. For those who have a big appetite! 
The Tom yum flavour was quite fragrant but just a tad too salty. Risotto could be a little less saucy as well. 
Taro cheesecake sounded really unique. But it wasn\'t yammy enough for me, and was a little too dense. Would have preferred a lighter texture. Nevertheless, the Nutella cheesecake was pretty good. Would love the cheesecake portion to have a little more Nutella, but it\'s not too bad :)
Initially we were quite skeptical about it. Wondering whether it was taro infused waffles or just waffles with taro sauce. But to my delight it was waffles infused with taro paste! Sure was yammy. The waffle is chewy with taro paste oozing out from the sides. 
\"Crashed\" the tasting party and got introduced to the Taro Waffle. Interesting eat. Waffle with taro paste in it. Not the crispy-kind-of-waffle due to the paste but decent enough. So if you like Taro and Waffle, do give it a try!
A signature item on the menu, their Taro Waffles is a pleasant departure from the norm. It\'s not apparent in my picture but this soft-style waffle has a filling of taro (yam) paste within, making every bite extra \"taro-fic\" 😄 Good news for lovers of yam.
Located at the lobby is BIG hotel, sure looks promising but still lacking. 😁 Here\'s cheesy lobster sandwich w truffle fries.
Good news for those who don\'t like using their hands to eat chicken wings - these ones here are boneless! Obviously, this means more work for the chef but such thoughtful convenience will surely be appreciated by many. Especially those ladies who have manicures too pretty to be dirtied. \n<br />When our group of Burpple Tastemakers were there for a tasting, I found the chicken meat within to be tender and juicy. But combined with the outer Spicy Doritos crust made the whole thing a little too salty and dry for my taste. Then again, perhaps all it takes is to wash these winglets down with extra drinks 😁
Scouting for more new cafés that may not be in the radar.
Pretty good i must say! The chicken wings doesn\'t have wings which make it easier to chew on and it\'s more tender! The bubblegum milkshake is unique too
Really like the texture of the cake! Shall be back to try the mains next time
Froth, we finally found you! For those ppl who are finding this spot, it\'s inside BIG hotel at the basement so don\'t missed it! I really love the decor of the place.
In the basement of BIG Hotel is Froth; a new cafe at Bugis that also serves breakfast to the hotel guests in the morning. Their Nutella Cheesecake is light on the chocolate-hazelnut flavour, but retains the cheesy flavour. The crumbly bottom was actually pretty thick, and when coupled with the hazelnuts on the top, gives the cake a pretty Ferrero Rocher-like flavour. Pretty indulgent, but it would be good to share one with one other because it may get a bit jelak after a while.
Hidden in the basement of BIG Hotel is Froth, a new cafe in Bugis that also serves breakfast for the hotel guests in the morning. These winglets are being coated in bread crumbs before being fried, and then covered with some Doritos with spicy seasonings. Chicken was deboned before serving so it would be less messy to eat, while there was enough spiciness that gives it a kick to it. Meat was tender, but the seasoning can be rather salty for some.
Siobak aglio ($25.90), served with linguine and slow roasted pork belly crackling, which could be much crispier.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#pasta #italian #fusion #foodsg #sgfood #instasg #foodiesg #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodgasm #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodiegram #photooftheday #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats
Dinner certainly looked and tasted guuuuuuuud. Presentation 💯! Only peeves were that the sio bak skin could have been crisper (so it doesn\'t stick to teeth) and... don\'t charge $3++ for tap water leh.
3/5
This was the best we had in Froth and we would gladly visit again just for this. Even for Jae, who ain\'t a taro lover, she liked this too! The Waffle was crispy on the outside, mushy in the inside and along with the Earl Grey Ice-Cream it was made for heaven! There was also Taro balls that tastes like \"mash potato but taro flavour\" as Kae describes it. ➡ Full review on our blog: JaeplusKae.wordpress.com / Link in Bio!\n<br />⚊\n<br />📍 No. 2 Finlayson Green\n<br />Ascott Raffles Place\n<br />Singapore 049247\n<br />⚊\n<br />For more reviews: #JaeplusKaeReviews\n<br />Our blog: JaeplusKae.wordpress.com\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#igsg #sg #sgfoodie #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #singaporefood #sgeats #sgfoodporn #sgfoodtrend #instafood_sg #sgcafe #burpple #burpplesg #foodporn #foodlover #foodpics #foodphotography #foodgasm #foodgram #food #foodie #instafood #foodblog #foodblogger #먹스타그램 #먹방 #vsco #dessert

Clever idea to have taro in waffles. #BurppleXChope
Love the fluffy texture of the wholegrain french toast. And the avocado purée was creamy without being overly sweet. 🥑🥑🥑\n<br />. \n<br />This was taken at a media tasting.

One of them is the Char Siew Eggs Benedict ($15.90), which pays homage to the popular char siew puff with homemade barbecued pull pork in it and served with poached eggs.

The pork was unevenly cooked with some parts tender and some parts tough. Pasta was underwhelming as it was too oily. Bacon didn\'t help either.

And to never to stand on one\'s dignity.
Ordered the Beer Beef Bowl but wasn\'t too impressed with its presentation. Beer stew rice with furikake, bonito and sliced beef sounded good. But was kinda disappointed that there wasn\'t much outstanding about the rice. The sliced beef could be better done to be more flavourful and more succulent. Overall a decent bowl but nothing to shout about. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #burpproved

烧肉 + 肉干-inspired-bacon pasta for dinner! #😍 #nomnomnom
The dish surprised us when it was served because it was decorated so prettily, with colorful petals and the items were thoughtfully-arranged. The pork belly - with its crispy skin and melty meat, was so tender and tasty, lending its flavour to the springy linguine pasta.
The long, thin lobster roll was refreshing and distinctive in saccharine murkiness of squid ink essence as well as sweetness of springy lobster chunks.  The truffle fries were very aromatic and sapid in earthly notes, completing the meal beautifully.
A revamped lobster roll from their previous mentaiko cheese topping, now with squid ink mentaiko instead. Healthier now also with the charcoal brioche that wrapped the lobster chunks within, topped with tobiko for that subtle crunch. Good also that it came with truffle fries for a more satisfying meal. #burpple #burpplesg #foodsg #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodforfoodies #foodie #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #sgfood #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping  #nomnomnom #sgfooddiaries #sgfoodlover #lobster #brioche #charcoal
Hmmm... how do I start? Tell it like it is. A squid ink lobster roll stuffed with lobster chunks, squid ink mayo, pickled radish &amp; tobiko.\n<br />◾\n<br />Personally I felt there was alittle too much mayo in the roll thereby resulting in the texture of the roll being compromised. Squid being infused in the dough to create the roll; squid ink in mayo and some of it on top of the roll. The lobster chunks, somewhat, was lost in all that ink. Could not taste the sweetness of the lobster. Preferred more of arugula than the truffle fries.\n<br />◾\n<br />Alittle too much of the ink which basically overpowered the other components. However, those who loves squid ink can give this a try...who knows u might like it. The bright edible flowers were a welcome sight. \n<br />The costs here are on a slightly higher side as compared to their previous location. \n<br />Shout out to Wilson @froth.sg ... thank you for the complimentary coffee, the chitchat &amp; the attentive service.\n<br />#lunch #newrestaurant #i8mondays #8dayseat #whati8today #hungrygowhere #opensnap #burpplesg #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #narratrs #igers #sgig #singaporeeats #tripadvisor #discoversg

Nice cafe to hang out.
generous serving of taro, like it!!
Return to froth but armed with entertainer this time around. Personally tried the lobster sandwich. The filling was decent though I wasn\'t won over by the voice of bread and fillings. Doritos crusted winglets were uplifted from the spicy crunch of the chips and they came boneless, perfect for lazy people like me.\n<br />Froth will be moving to finlayson green at raffles place end  April.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sgrestaurant #entertainerapp #burpple #sgcafe #sgcafehopping
😊
(1-for-1 on the entertainer app!!) we were quite disappointed initially because we realized the app can only be used on mains which were quite limited and the dishes we wanted to try were in the brunch menu :-( among the list of pastas and carbs-loaded food, we managed to pick out 2 slightly interested ones - seafood tomyum risotto and lobster sandwich. Personally didn\'t like the dollop of sauce on the lobster roll but the meat was chewy and fresh! Toast lacked the crisp but had a nice hint of spice unlike a usual boring piece of bread. The risotto however, was delicious on a whole new level!!! Well seasoned and spiced with a thick, creamy version of the usual light tomyum. Generous serving of seafood which was fresh but could do with a little more seasoning. The ambiance is GREAT and perfect if for a chill catchup / nice date night :-) slightly expensive for cafe food but honestly very worth the price!

Because Sundays are perfect for brunch. Happy to revisit @froth.sg &amp; try their weekend brunch today!
Thought and effort went into its presentation. But when I looked at photos of past waffles it illicited waffle envy because the waffles were drenched in taro sauce goodness, whereas mine just has an awkward strip of sauce here and there. The sauce was integral to the taro-ness of the dish, don\'t be stingy with it please! [On another note the salted caramel ice cream had really great flavour but texture wise was a little too soft than what I am used to.] #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #taro #waffle #waffles #icecreamwaffle #dessert #burpple
Quite generous with the three pieces piled on top of what I think was a baked rosti. The chicken breast meat (I think) was sufficiently tender. The potato was well seasoned although the rosti tended to fall apart (lack of a binding agent?). #sgfoodie #sgfood #sgcafehopping #sgcafe #friedchicken #rosti #burpple
Too full for the most famed taro waffles and that has to go into the next visit. Not regretting choosing the weekday lunch special of Roast chicken, mushroom, bacon, cheese topped with omelette in stuffed bun at only $9.90++ and screw the relatively inattentive service. #igsg #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodies #hungrygowhere #openricesg #burpple #bitessg #latergram #froth #bighotel #foodvsco #vscocam #instafood #instafoodsg #sgcafefood #exploresingaporecafes #cafehoppingsg #sgfoodtrend #foodpairing #jamyundies #jamyeats #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #onthetable

Their very own rendition of escargot ($12.90++), decorated with savory soil, crushed nuts, carrot purée and miso glaze! So mmmm... Although some of which were slightly overcooked!
Rosti with salted egg battered fried chicken and drizzled with homemade potato jam, expect something sweet and savoury in one plate.
sinfully good, so delicately moist. what\'s there not to love about this dish?
A Little Too Crowded but Atmosphere was still alright. Highly recommend to visit on Weekdays tho. I ordered their famous Taro Waffles with a Scoop of Toasted Marshmallows Ice Cream. I love how the waffles is stuffed with Yam Paste. Wished they were more generous with the Taro Balls. But, Definitely One of my favorite waffles... 
.\n<br /> .\n<br />Garlic butter escargots, carrot purée, crushed nuts, baby carrots, savory soil, miso glaze.
This place has really unique food and we bumped into all the food instagrammers 😏
Perfect for greedy ones like me who just want a bit of everything!😆🙊
So, was stoked to see it on the menu of Froth as a milkshake. I had to order it. It was decided the best drink of our nights, will be back just for this babe. Speculoos milkshake $11.90++ #sgcafe #sg #eat #food #yummy #speculoos #delish #foodporn #drinks #love #fotd #frothsg #burpple
The dish we were most excited about was the Yuan yang risotto. Now, don\'t be too disappointed its not coffee &amp; tea risotto. We get to mix and match 2 of the following 4: Pumpkin, spinach, truffle mushroom &amp; squid ink. Ordered 2 combos - pumpkin+spinach(back) and truffle+squidink(front). I dare say the saltiness was too overpowering especially in the squid ink. Otherwise, it would\'ve been delightful to ingest. Each flavor served with pumpkin, veg, enoki &amp; squid tempura. I thought location, ambiance, plating, service was great. Otherwise, tone down on the salt and waiting time was rather long. #sgcafe #sg #food #eats #love #yummy #break #dinner #instagram #instafood #foodgasm #fotd #frothcafe #foodporn #foodtrend #igsg #burpple

I really like this cream-less carbonara, which I heard is the authentic kind of carbonara! The yolk of that oozy sous vide egg combines with the bacon fat to form a really luscious but not cloying carbonara sauce. It\'s really satisfying to slurp up the penne pasta with all that yolk mmmm.

The taste, or lack thereof, could either be affected by the tom yum risotto we had before you, or the sore throat last week. Wished you were crispy, though it may be hard to since you were taro-ly stuffed. #socorny Still, you were a sight to behold. #supportlocal #cafehoppingsg #sgcafes #burpple #foodstagram #instafood #foodpornsg #deconstructeddesserts #eatoutsg

☆ Churros are quite dry here. Pretty decent for random craving.
With good winglets💖

Ice creams nice, but waffles is as soggy as a snobbish food writer\'s inflated arms. Oh wait, the arms sti wins! #inflatedarmsgoodforlifebuoy it\'s a shame as the waffles does taste nice underneath and there is a distinct whiff of taro there. Oh well .. #taro #waffles #earlgrey #icecream #sgig #sgfood #food #foodgasm #FoodPorn #burpple #frothsg

Craving for it now!!
Here is their pineapple waffle for some extra Huat this season. Photo by Burppler Elaine Koh #Burpple
Happy 4th day of CNY!! 😄
Made the mistake of choosing sea salt caramel , it doesn\'t go well with the taro paste. Do note: yam and taro are not the same thing( googled it) personally I think it would be better with a simpler tasting ice cream 😁
Worth every calorie. Instagram worthy and tummy worthy definitely. Froth cafe is most definitely the gem of Big Hotel. Happy Valentine\'s day to all!
yes everything was in my favourite colour 💜 Thanks @froth.sg, I will be back ☺️ #frothsg
A drip of my favourite soup as deco!! 😅 #limsia #ジュンの食日記 #burpple

Did I take photos for too long, I thought? The earl grey ice cream still didn\'t melt after 5 mins of photo-taking...so.. #frothsg #sgig #sgfoodies #food #foodsg #foodies #foodstagram #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #eatoutsg #instafood #igfood #foodporn #sgfood #foodphotography #foodgasm #desserts #burpple #hungrygowhere #sgcafefood #omyfoodies #sgfoodporn

It\'s not too bad, @pinkybetanie couldn\'t stop herself from finishing the #trufflefries (and so did I) 😂😂 Wished we had more time to try their desserts though.
