Earl Grey + Lemon + Cheesecake = All my favourites in one! Earl Grey Lemon Cheesecake ($6) has strong Earl Grey essence but not overwhelming. We love the lemon curd and strawberry twist as it balances the rich cheesecake. So It\'s not too sweet.
It\'s actually my first time coming to a cafe in Singapore (I mean... they\'re everywhere so I usually go for local, hawker-y food) and I decided to pop my Singaporean cafe cherry at a cafe nearby that was loaded with people. 
Chye Seng Huat Hardware has a lovely alfresco area lit with romantic fairy lights. The Cold Brew ($7) is made for strong coffee lovers like us - its thick concoction is bitter and slightly acidic. We asked for the Cempedak Crumble ($5) to be heated up, and it was a surprise. There were pieces of cempedak in the cake and it was not overly sweet. What a local fusion taste.
The espresso butter was unique with a mix of bitter &amp; saltiness that made me go wow 👍🏻 and it paired well with the bread although I wished there was much ⭐️ 4/5 ⭐️. ⚠️ Although 3 seemingly small pieces, it was very filling &amp; I ended up taking 1 home for my parents (who loved it).\n<br />📍cshhcoffee, 150 Tyrwhitt Road S207563
Not too bad for a try to end of a meal. As my friend n I find it special. If u want to try something interesting! Give it a try, is taste good, is not too sweet- right for healthy choice I Guess ✌🏻 Forget the cost price $$$
Flat white that I had the day was almost! Beside describing abt the nicely make latte art. I want to share that they are having a new menu for there lunch 👌🏻 As I just went n was surprise at the new menu 😊 Tried 1 of the burger there is \"shiok\" ☺️
Hazelnut Softserve ($4.50)
We are all afraid of changes because we are all too comfy, feeling safe in the comfort zone. Change is what changes you. Change is what that breaks your limit. Change is knowing that you haven\'t learn much. Change is knowing that it\'s all for the better. \n<br />In the meantime, let\'s just soak in the creamy and delicious cold brew white [$7.50] from my favourite @cshhcoffee
Pastries:\n<br />Sticky Fig Pudding - love the texture with fig\n<br />Salted Caramel Goji Berry Tart - find it a little too sweet but it goes well with coffee\n<br />Drinks: \n<br />Ice Mocha &amp; Ice Chocolate - not too sweet
Perfectly extracted coldbrew turned frothy. Decided on their mac and cheese (it has brie in it- my fave!) to go with because cake is too ordinary 😂 Wish I had more time here to try an actual cuppa.
TGIF! Take a chill pill and have some cold brew to go along with it. If not, an iced latte will do fine.
Mixed mushroom with sous vide egg, mozzarella cheese and baby chard on soughdough, butternut puree.\n<br />One of the better selections at CSHH. Loved the creamy sweet butternut squash purée on the lightly toasted chewy sourdough. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #cshhcoffee #burpple
Just when I thought I\'ve seen everything, I get this pound cake toast that blows my mind.\n<br />Instead of bread toast, you get this buttery mess of a toast that melts in your mouth.\n<br />Definitely something I could do with unfinished butter pound cake at home. Loved it!
Reached here late. So just grabbed a beer. But must try again for the chic location and relaxing ambience. 
The cafe concept is quite special ,we order their nitro black coffee ,iced latte and earl grey cheese cake ..nothing attract me to coming back here again .
such a beautiful and picturesque place with a wonderful ambience to do work or relax with a book and hide from the heat. cold brew coffee and iced mocha were on point and the pasta was sweet, flavourful and delectable and the price was pretty reasonable too. 
One of the pioneers of the cafe scene in Jalan Besar, Chye Seng Huat — by the good people behind Papa Palheta — houses a roastery and a coffee bar, which allows 360 degree views of baristas doing their thing. Their coffees are generally great, but it is the Nitro Black Matter ($7) that we are coming back for, especially when temperatures climb. The coffee is treated with nitrogen under high pressure and chilled in a keg. When pulled, the result is an aromatic, strong yet refreshing coffee with a frothy foam head and silky mouth feel — much like an ice cold beer!
And my off day 😁\n<br />We all could have some joe \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #cshh
Seriously, I have never drunk so much coffee in a day.  I am more of a Chinese Tea drinker and I do sometimes miss my 普尔, 乌龙, 铁观音 and 大红炮 whenever I go cafehopping. (Date: 10 April 2016 Sunday)
So underrated of a dish, but a double thumbs up from me and my sister for this. Well marinated and cooked mushrooms that we splendid, and the oozy eggs. I\'ve been to way too many hipster cafes that serve badly poached eggs and I\'m glad this cafe is not one of them. Nicely browned crisp toast helped soak up the leftover creamy mushroom sauce, allowing you to savour each bite. My only gripe is that the cafe is quite small, so the inside can get really packed. I sat outside and practically melted in the heat.
I liked this, although I\'m not much of a cheesecake fan! This had the texture of more cakey rather than the usual dense cheesecake. Had a strong earl grey flavour, tho it did lack the robust lemon scent. Didn\'t like the base tho, it was mildly soggy and not crumbly or crisp. Not the best cheesecake but still nice nonetheless.
——\n<br />Perfect iced mocha for a Wednesday afternoon. Topped with chocolate shavings, the barista took pride in ensuring every cup of coffee is perfect by taking accurate measurement of the coffee. Regardless of the pressures from the queues.\n<br />No, i dont mind waiting longer than usual for a good cup. In between works. And many like-minded.
Love the atmosphere,pretty decor, huge 360 bar counter, you could watch masterful baristas work their magic!
And I\'m glad they now serve hot mocha. 😋
Because of Marché, I have been spoiled when it comes to rosti. A golden crisp finish is what I\'ve learned to expect. Thus, the rosti here proved to be a let-down. Besides being soft and very oily, the shredded potatoes were heavy and \"wet\" as opposed to light and dry-ish. Thankfully, I managed to find some consolation in the smoked salmon (served with a side of sour cream and chives) and nicely poached egg. I was very pleased with my cappuccino too. 
Iced Mint Mocha ($7.50), refreshing and comforting at the same time, though I wish the chocolate taste to go through abit more will be perfect!
Recommended to take one to three bottles daily to improve efficiency.
Chye Seng Huat is no stranger to anyone. It was and still is the place to be for a good hearty brunch and strong coffee. The prices are reasonable and the portion for this breakfast is huge (unable to finish all, although I was pretty hungry then). The eggs, are fluffy and firm just the way I like it. And the tomatoes are gorgeously roasted that it is bursting with sweetness. Interestingly choice of ham used, thick salty and meaty. It paired well with the small potatoe salad on top. Can\'t grow wrong with this plate on a Sunday. Or any other day, where you want to be away from the bustle, but accessible  enough, if you don\'t have a car. 
Not. This is the nitro black matter cold coffee on tap from @cshhcoffee. The foam layer is formed by the nitro, which also creates this creamy and ultra smooth and silky feeling when the coffee slides down your throat - there is no cream in this at all. The brew is aromatic and strong yet feels light and refreshing. It is so smooth I could go on drinking this if I were sitting next to the tap. I love it, and if I had my way, I would have the tap installed next to my desk. \n<br />#chyesenghuathardware #burpple
Thank you #AmexSG for introducing the hippest spots. Loved \'that father drink\'! Great company great night. Back to the old Sch with mambo night in our party limo, nonsense \'he said she said\' talk by @menshealth_sg, and Indian poker over craft beers. #chillaxsg
My favorite coffee (nuts &amp; bolts beans), together with the pork burger is simply the best combination for brunch !
Ordered Huat breakfast and strawberry cake. The sweetness of the cake is just nice, taste good. The breakfast is great too. The interior of the cafe is interesting, outdoor maybe abit warm. Overall, a pleasant experience for my first time visit.
The last time I checked into this place was Sep\'12. 😁.. How time flies!
The black specks are crunchy bits of tea leaves. The fragrant taste of the earl grey hides the richness of the cheesecake very well. The cheesecake is firm and the lemon cream goes very well, giving it an extra kick. Served cold. Pretty good!
CSHH coffee after being wanting to go for awhile. Had ice latte and cold brewed coffee. Latte was fine.. The cold brewed coffee is a no for me... Kinda too acidic (sour). However the earl grey cake is a thumb up!! Not too sweet.. Same goes for the chocolate chiffon cake.. So coffee with cake?? Yes.. Best.. But maybe another coffee the next time. 
If you have listened to the song \"Hardware Store\" by parody genius Weird Al Yankovic, you would understand the excitement of someone going to a hardware store. \n<br />Chye Seng Huat Hardware is no exception; except that it serves food and coffee instead of bolts and screws! \n<br />Pictured here is their duck salad ($14). I\'ve also tried other dishes on their menu and they are all equally good.\n<br />I recommend going for their handbrewed coffee; it\'s more unique and you may share it with 1 other person if you are sensitive to caffeine (it fills about 2 cups). I also like how they provide a little factsheet when they serve their coffee, educating you on the characteristics of the coffee beans they have used for your coffee.\n<br />What I love most is the comfortable ambience; although there is constant chatter, it never gets too noisy... and the aroma of coffee floods the space and is almost therapeutic to breathe in. The small space also adds to the coziness of it all -- just remember to avoid going in larger groups (i.e. more than 4)!\n<br />Prices are in NETT which makes it so much easier to split the bill when dining with friends. Budget ranges from $6 ~ $20+ depending on whether you are ordering food or dessert to go with your coffee.
😍 Nope, today is not Sunday for me yet. 😌💃 #ChasingShadows #ChasingLight #Cuppa #Coffee #Hobikopi
Located near Jalan besar Stadium and alot more cafes nearby (great for cafehopping around), went to visit on a rainy sunday morning, probably the reason why the place was not very packed. Ambience inside the cafe was great with its cool dim lightings, but i chose outside seatings for natural lighting since the sky was turning brighter despite the rain... Food was great! Items featured in the picture includes: The Huat Breakfast $17/Charcoal pork burger $18/Earlgrey cheesecake $5-6 (can\'t rmb😅) Verdict: really love the food here. The pork burger was well executed though I\'d prefer fries rather than chips as its sides. 10/10 would recommend, I\'d make a revisit myself again😊 4.40/5.0
Was quite disappointed with this overall. The poached eggs were slightly overcooked and the tuna was dry. What really made me cast the deciding vote on this was that the black pepper seasoning on the sides of the tuna was overly strong for my liking. I felt the main point of the dish, the taste of tuna, couldn\'t come through as a result. 
~~ May your week be short and your coffee be strong 👍 #thefoodjournalist
(P.s. the pic looks blurrr here but its actually v clear on my phone. Not sure why but it also applies to all my other posts here)
Hang in there! Weekends are coming! 3 more days to my holiday! Woohoo!
Haven\'t been back to CSSH for a while.  I like that it\'s less crowded and the cold brew tasted better than usual today.
Bite-sized vanilla cake that was rather dense and quite dry served with a dollop of Nutella for chocolatey flavour. Not something I would order again.
A chill out tea break with my old man is befitting for the cold weather. Brought him to CSSH Coffee Bar for the first time and he claimed that the Papa Pahelta blend is by far the best coffee he ever drank. \n<br />P.S first photo taken and uploaded by my S6 Edge! \n<br />Support #thefoodjournalist
We had The Huat Breakfast ($18) with scrambled eggs, Mushroom Aglio Olio ($17), Latte ($5.50) and one of CSHH brew: Suke Quto ($6). The food menu might be limited here, but the items are good. Nonetheless, coffee is the reason most come by. The Suto Quoto (Balanced) which is slight acidic but mellows with a sweet honey finish. A must try if you\'re a black coffee lover.
Mad love this cake. Earl grey essence was strong but not overwhelming. The lemon curd on top of the cake added a tart twist to an otherwise sweet and rich cake. Strawberries atop the curd was delightfully sweet and tart simultaneously. Must have at this cafe.
This here is Nitro Black Matter ($7), cold brew coffee passed through nitrogen and poured from a tap like Guinness.
Sour filling with the buttery tart. Well balanced pastry.
This is how life should be.
Chye Seng Huat serves friggin’ good coffee and perhaps mains, but they come with a price. My Papa Pork Burger ($18) was surprisingly well-executed. Capped with charcoal buns, the burger had homemade pork patty and pineapple chutney in between and chips by the side. I should give credit to the sweetness of the pineapple chutney that made the entire burger beyond appetising.  But chef, may I have fries and a handful of greens instead of chips?

got to try this during a birthday celebration! Loved the earl grey fragrance and the cheesecake was rich. But kinda crumbly. The lemon curd &amp; strawberry was a nice touch to an otherwise sweet cake. 
You gonna be low low low.. 😳 // Coffee to calm the soul ☕️ #shootkahliao
It\'s texture was similar to a biscuit. They didn\'t warmed up for me but still it was dryyyy. .\n<br />|\n<br />However, it\'s daily brew was good. Light sourly aftertaste and a smooth texture. 😊
Chye Seng Huat finally reopened after some reworking of its outdoor area. Tonight\'s cuppa was done just right; could taste the fruitiness in the blend with ample amount of milk added. A smooth and creamy cuppa.
Lattes, Huat breakfast and the Italian Breakfast | If acidic coffee is your thing, their lattes might resound. Their Huat Breakfast\'s the same old (breakfast platter, what else?) but their Italian breakfast surprised with its humble-looking bolognaise adding a burst of flavour to the eggs and toast. Wouldn\'t pay to have this too often though. Sans the ambience, CSSH is just too pricey for its slightly above-average F&amp;B.
We didn\'t get a good night\'s sleep. We\'re a little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.\" - Jerry Seinfeld
Average food. The cold brew to me tasted a bit weird especially after adding the sugar syrup, would also have preferred the coffee to have a stronger taste. 
Huat Huat Huat ahhhh~~~~ 🎅🎄🎅🎄
The cafe is free seating. Food was delicious. Coffee is which i had was hand brewed, its extraordinary. Worth the try.
Banana pancakes with maple syrup, you can\'t say no to breakfast for lunch. Reading Ziggy Magazine whist enjoying my cup of hot chocolate 
Lusciously creamy
I was kindly gifted a box of these, so i was finally able to try them since seeing them for the first time months ago behind the glass display at CSH. I must say they are pretty decent; authentic, non-experimental and earnest. They were also priced at a very reasonable $1 for each, and $3.80 for a box of 5. Flavours include (left to right) peanut, salted mung bean, sweet potato, sweet mung bean and yam.
I don\'t usually expect food at places lauded for their coffee to be good but this is surprisingly tasty!! $16 👍
Celebrated a birthday brunch at Chye Seng Huat. You won\'t go wrong when you order the Almond Croissant and pairing it with a cup of Flat White.
It\'s probably just for novelty sake. Cold Brew served from a Nitro tap is a good idea, especially when it adds fizziness to the cold brew, but that acidity is enough to make me cringe.
Honestly I would not have ordered these if I was not burning some time while waiting for someone nearby to have lunch. Or would I have been here in the first place. Awesomely dry, and the Ang Ku Kueh\'s skin just came off from the fillings without much difficulty. Quite unacceptable even at $1.00/pc
Strong coffee! Interesting ambience at CSGH; old coffee shop with modern feel :)
she was amused by its interior, although the roast was too strong for her preference. the son happily offered to finish her coffee. slurps!
everything bout chye seng huat just speaks for itself: the semi secret entrance, the eclectic ambience, the indie music, artisan craft, and my exceptional flat white. what\'s there not to love at CSHH right? so i really really fancy my flat white here. it would be love actually if not for the ridiculous driving around for a legally approved car parking. TGIF, TGICSHH.
Surprise, surprise. Who knew this about CSH??? I never cared for their food, because i felt like they pretty much were just focused on doing Papa Palheta beans justice.. Anyone knows how they are? The sweet potato one sounds particularly intriguing.
We walked from Farrer Park tennis centre to Rouse, realised we were already so near Bugis that we might as well walk a little further to Chye Seng Huat. This is what post-training afternoons with SMU tennis are made of ☺️
Decent tasting kuehs for the price, good way to introduce local delights to oversea friends. Good to divert a little for all these boring cafe food. We want the coffee and local delights. Stop the sandwich and salad, it\'s boring and OD.
Always crowded but good vibes. I came for the coffee. Medium-Full bodied, pretty dark roast, and just right 👌
...01/06/13 - starting the month right. carefree Sundays are the best.
3rd stop. #cafehopping #burpple #coffeeandcravings
Nice food, nice drinks, nice ambience. 
Most people associate CCSH with great coffee, but do you know they serve really decent mains as well? 
I like their size for cakes and scones, you get to try them all and doesn\'t burn your pocket or your calorie quota!
Love impromptu catch up session😍
The french toast was quite yummy. Goes well with their coffee too.
Nice looking but a little disappointing when it came to the actual eating. Although it was a pretty golden crisp on the outside, the inside of the French Toast was undercooked and soggy. For $12+, I felt it was also overpriced considering that it came with only whipped cream, a couple of berries and syrup.
Haven\'t heard much good stuff bout the food at chye seng huat but the steak &amp; cheese sandwich I had was absolutely delicious! Looking at this picture makes me crave for one right now!! Sandwich, would you please appear in front of me?
Good stuff. Love the size.
Get your own coffee blend. Super cool place. Fragrant and reasonably priced caffeine :)
People say the food at Chye Seng Huat isn\'t good. But I bet to differ! It was good!! ^^ Didn\'t really like the cold brew though because it\'s more on the sour side. Really like the daily brew though, could drink it plain. 
A unique match  of salmon on pancakes makes it rather tantalising
Still one of my fav spots around. Love the ambient to bits 
This poison is very balanced. Definitely coming back when I need a cuppucino!
Not my kind of beans, too acidic
Better than I had expected!
Focus on Goodness.
Flat white in 3D. Oxymoron.
Having a late coffee break at Chye Seng. Great coffee and atmosphere!
Had an awesome sundate with this girl! 😄We finally met up &amp; had so much to catch up on, like there wasn\'t enough time.. Lol lets meet up again soon!!☺ Together with the rest we hope! @janice_memories @adeadelinee @chienjuen @yamashita_min @meishan1212 we miss u! #ChyeSengHuatHardware #cshh #cafe #potd #instapic #friends!
more on the sweet to very sweet note. Goes well with bitter coffee.
Sticky date pudding and carrot cake!
Delicious salmon with cheese cream and perfectly paired with pancake... It\'s simply yummy! 
Our breakfast, lunch, high tea! Yums in the tums once again. Great food, great company ☕

We were served 4 different versions of Fried Hokkien Mee @ Burrple Launch Party tonight, and asked to vote for our favourite :) I say H4!

( French : coffee with milk ) \n<br />It\'s the smell of coffee that brought us to the same place...
While quickly becoming a coffee institution, CSHH still manages to be a cosy space. The gorgeously modified industrial-chic interior of this old hardwarestore provides the perfect setting for enjoying a good cup of coffee. If you\'refeeling adventurous, give their galvanized ale a try- literally coffee beer. It\'s strangely good!
Latte &amp; Raspberry Muffin.... #burpple
I say late bird get its early breakfast:p! Wanna have a bite? Yummmmm!! Ham omelette with toast CSHH for a kick start

Finally made my way there! Feel so suaku! So what\'s your thoughts about Chye Seng Huat Hardware cafe? Love it or overrated?
Alas, some comfort food for this long weekend. An Orange Cappuccino &amp; Banana Bread for dessert. 😌
Love the fact that they are constantly improving their food menu. Coffee is especially good here at CSHH. :-) Must try! 
Cold brew at CSHH Coffee Bar. Not a fan of sour coffee so I didn\'t really like this... Ordered another Flat White after this and it was so good!
Super refreshing lemonade that looks like a mojito 😜. Makes me hungry after drinking it ..has ginger bits in it :)
this cafe is not your regular coffee joint. they even conduct workshops for baristas-hopefuls. need practice? they even sell coffee machines for you to try at home! #igsg #coffee #cafes #instagramsg

A very typical Sunday brunch.
Immediately was attracted by the looks of this luxurious Chocolate Tart ($8) - crumbly tart, dark chocolate based and piped milk chocolate mousse. Then finished off with brownies pieces. Really super rich in flavour, good for sharing as it got slightly jelat at the end. #TheMarouInvasion

All-in-1 @ Chye Seng Huat Hardware (CSHH) ☕️\n<br />*****\n<br />A much talked about coffee place in Jalan Besar. While the outdoor seating is spacious. Music &amp; set up are superb. The seating inside the cafe is quite chaotic with lots of patron but no standing space. We order cold brew Nitro $7, Goji tart with salted caramel $5.8 and Ang Ku Kueh 2 pcs for $3. The taste is just average with a bend on sweet side. ⛱\n<br />.\n<br />The CSHH cafe runs many interesting intro coffee workshops on its 2nd floor. A good selection of craft beers at the back room. We will definitely be back for more tasting!! P.S. They are closed on Monday. 🍺\n<br />*****\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#CSHH #chyeseng #cafe #coffee #coffeelover #singapore #timeoutsg #sgfoodie #dessert #dessertlover #gojiberry #craftbeer #coldbrew #brew #coffeemaker #lifestyle #specialtycoffee #hipster #slowlife #roasting #cupping #coffeebean #coffeejourney #specialtycoffee #gourmetcoffee

Great coffee and healthy mains like the salmon teriyaki donburi

It is just so captivating because it is non-complicated, minimalistic and simply simple.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Remember this roti ice cream of way back then? Ice cream uncles still plys the streets in his tricycle selling wafer ice cream and roti ice cream. So this is just a slice of colored bread with a dollop of peanut butter jelly ice cream. Looks pretty enough. But it was alittle sweet for me and the bread was not soft enough and atad dry.\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />So my search for old school favorites continue #inmyoldneighborhood and hopefully I can find the hidden charm of way back then. Would you like to take this journey with me.. down memory lane?? #icecreamsandwich #dessertlovers #oldschool #hungrygowhere #8dayseat #burpple #stfoodtrending #sgfollowers #sgfoodies #sgbloggers #instafoodsg #openricesg #instafollow #eatbooksg #discoversg #nomnom #foodporn

That white cold brew tho.. @cshhcoffee
And I\'m happy that I got the Huat Dog instead
This bowl of pasta is surprisingly good. The tomato sauce had the right balance of flavour. The cucumbers added a fresh taste.

Despite the competition heating up, chye seng huat is still thriving among locals and visitors alike. No wonder even their cashiers display \"huat ah\". As it was the the case when I first visited a few years back, I had to settle for alfresco seating.

This cafe does not have a soy milk option. Strangely enough, customers can\'t order mocha piping hot but only with ice.

I don\'t know much about coffee, so it\'s not my place to judge. But 1 thing for sure...I\'ll definitely come back. And took some more pics. And probably blog about it. Probably. 😂\n<br />-\n<br />The place is sooo cozy. Vintage-artsy feeling [if I\'m not using the wrong word].\n<br />For all cafe-hop-er out there, [which i believe most of you have been there] give it a try, and tell me what you think? Especially if you know coffee well..😉\n<br />-\n<br />Cold Brew Coffee [S$7.00]
Never forget those who are there for you when you are down and out! 😊👍

Sadly, time is never enough. \n<br />On a side note, it\'s Thursday! 1 more day to the coming of the weekend.
Iced latte.
I think I need coffee now.
At least they offered me a free cup of v60 because i was sitting at the counter. This is a saving grace to the previous bad cup of coffee..
Wanted to relax with a nice cup of coffee. But turned out to be too flat and sour. Sweetness of milk wasn\'t brought out at all either.

Breakfast in a cup.
Refreshing lemonade for u?
Nothing beats fresh brewed coffee! 
Cold cough mixture. No it\'s cold caffeine.
Surprisingly good tummy filler in a coffee bar!
Very good brew :)
Capsules are dead. Mandatory shot at CSHH (haha!)
Ginger Tea Cake, quite good but we liked the pistachio one better!
Second cup- Flat White. Very good coffee!
Pistachio and Cranberry Tea Cake mmhmmmm so good!

At CSHH for brunch with family :)
From the outside it doesn\'t seem to look like a coffee place
Classic place for unpretentious coffee \n<br />#food #foodie #eat #foodgasm #foodpics #foodporn #igers #instafood #instadaily #instamood #instagram #instafood #instagood #igsg #instagram #instasg #instagramsg #foodstagram #singapore #foodpics #yummy #coffee #sgcoffee #cshh
