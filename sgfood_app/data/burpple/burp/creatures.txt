4.5 munchies: The smashing combo of ngoh hiang and cuttlefish kueh pie tee served at CreatureS is something my Peranakan mama (grandma) would approve of if she were still around. Wrapped in crispy and slightly chewy beancurd skin, the ngoh hiang was stuffed full of juicy homemade minced pork and prawn. The kecap manis to go with the roll was also excellent.
Dense cream cheese goodness with a buttery cookie base. Sinful, but worth every extra calorie. Get it on its own for $9, or as part of their very reasonable set lunch.
2.5 munchies: In this V2.0 of the Zhu Burger, the XO Cognac marinade for the pork patty has been replaced with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Unfortunately, the sweet-sour taste in the ground meat did not quite come through ‚Äì thankfully for the accompaniment of the sweet vinegar dipping sauce. Sandwiched in charcoal buns, cheese, and a fried egg, the overall dish was too heavy for me even with the pineapple pur√©e, fruits, thick-cut onions and bell peppers, and a mesclun salad by the side.
I saw a rainbow after the spicy nonya curry. Creamy thick rainbow cheesecake.
Naughty Nonya\'s secret weapon.\n<br />Was like normal at first bite. But when the spice kicks in, sweats followed, tongue gotten shiok as you continue to eat it. Though wanna stop due to its spiciness but yet you still wanna continue. This is naughty!

Yes, it\'s a pork burger. Not an ordinary pork burger. The minced pork patty got itself a hangover from the XO Cognac marinate. The juicy thick cut tomato is old school but just perfect to counter any jelatness. Comes with a butterhead lettuce salad with a spicy mayo; and shoestring fries, not overly crispy and reminds me of how MacD fries used to be, the way how fries should always be done.
Can you find my burger in this medley of colours?
Interesting fusion food that is served at a more atas price. Food is pretty good &amp; the place looks pretty üòä the miso cooked with the cod was well balanced &amp; fragrance from this fatty fish could be savoured on my tastebuds. üòã they also serve an array of tea selections with interesting combinations n names! A good place to try if you are seeking something interesting for your palate

Not overly sweet and matches perfectly with the salted caramel sauce &amp; coconut ice cream.
A slice of decadent durian cake ‚Äî pandan genoise sponge, pandan vanilla chantilly cream and solid Mao Shang Wang durian paste with durian pulps! I absolutely love the use of pandan  here which made the whole cake very fragrant. Just thought that the sponge cake can be softer and the slice can be bigger! 
Crispy juicy chicken thigh and bouncy noodles. Big portion! Pricey but still worth a try
Pandan Genoise Sponge + Pandan Vanilla Chantilly Cream + Mao Shan Wang Durian Paste and u will fell like in heaven üòçhighly recommended durian cake ,and the plus point is the cafe have a very nice ambiance ,smell good too ,haha,gonna try their Orh Nee cake during next visit üòúoverall rating :4/5
The chicken was tender, juicy and crunchy!! The ah Ma noodles were even more amazing with a perfect texture, chewy QQ in every mouthful! It\'s seriously one of the most flavorful noodles I\'ve ever had! So much goodness! \n<br />Thank you @aerdreana for the recommendation!! I\'ll be back! üòè
Meet the CreatureS Laksa, looking all beautiful and classy with its head dress of cucumber strips and served with a golden spoon. I had high expectations of this but alas! Beyond the beautiful facade, there wasn\'t much else to hold it up, especially at SGD 24++. The Good: Refreshing Cucumbers, Tasty Chicken Meat, No cockles (I dislike cockles in my Laksa so this is a plus point for me, could be a negative for cockles fans though). The In-Between: Decent Laksa Broth that is lighter, less spicy and less oily than the usual ones (I prefer mine the usual way though some might prefer this), Decent Vermicelli. The Let Down: Tasteless Tau Pok, Lackluster prawns, Laksa broth that was too little as it was all soaked up by the vermicelli halfway through the meal. For me, a bowl of Laksa is all about the Tau Pok and broth, therefore this is really not for me. IMO, a bowl of SGD 3 nett Laksa served at the coffee shop near my house tasted better. But do not write off CreatureS just yet. Come here for the ambience and excellent service and their duck and pear salad. Just avoid the overpriced laksa unless you are a foreigner and would like to try Laksa at a nice restaurant and is afraid of it being too spicy or too strong. 
Meet the mysteriously beautiful roast duck salad from CreatureS. Of mixed descent, this dish combines the best of east and west. Delicious roast duck and crunchy prawn cracker with fresh raw vegetables, topped with a tangy sauce and some chillies, it\'s an awesome dish not to be missed. To eat, break the crispy prawn cracker, hear the satisfying crunching sound and mix well. Enjoy! As for their Laksa, I say we just eat it at the nearest hawker centre or coffee shop. 
Pimped with legit mint not syrup!! Thanks @goobz_  you da man! üòò ‚òïÔ∏è
Loved the ambience of the place! Ah Ma\'s cooking always on point with the texture and taste. Wished ah gong could\'ve have done a har geong fried chicken instead to give it more flavour.
Tender fried chicken thigh coated in Indian spices paired with chinchalook mayo, and served with a bowl of la-mien tossed in a light soy/sesame oil dressing. Simple, but very comforting. The chicken was perfect, with a thin layer of crispy crust/skin outside, and chunky and tender meat on the inside. The mayo helps to cut through the chicken if you find it too heavy or greasy. The noodles were cooked al dente, and we\'re very flavourful despite being tossed in a simple dressing. However, the taste might be a little reminiscent of instant mee goreng. As one of their cheapest items on the menu, this place is definitely one of the pricier options around. 
As if laksa and rojak for lunch wasn\'t enough, we had to have dessert too. Ok, my bad cause I insisted that since we were in the area, we might as well? Had seen someone share this durian cake on Facebook and I had to have it. No regrets!
Gastronomic racial harmony in this modern Singaporean dish!
The ah gong fried chicken and ah ma noodles. Seriously good
Miso marinated cod with Malay herb rice and cucumber. Love the rice and cucumber. The cod could be cooked a little less
Lovely little cream cheese cake, smooth and velvety, with colours that remind me of paddle pop ice cream, on a cinnamon biscuit crumble base!
Love the creamy thickness of this mellow pumpkin soup, with a piquant taste of fish sauce! And the slight kick from the chili and coconut relish lends some liveliness!
Sea salt did its part by balancing the bitterness of the dark chocolate. As for the pool of salted caramel, it was too sweet for my liking and I preferred to do without ‚Ä¢

The star of CreatureS is the orh-nee cake ($10). I\'m not a fan of yam but the coconut frosting complemented so well with the yam it left us raving! The rest - the Miso Cod ($32) and the Ngoh Hiang and cuttlefish Kueh-Pie-Tee ($24) were good but the hefty price tag will keep us away for a while.
But essentially it is pork belly stewed with fermented beans, usually achieving a melt in your mouth consistency. \n<br />The meat does not disappoint, it\'s fragrance unmistakable. Rich flavors of fatty pork that slides down the throat. \n<br />On a side note I would have preferred if they would give customers a choice of bread or rice. Or at the very least serve the baguette warm and lightly toasted. \n<br />Monster likes his bread toasted.\n<br />#hungryhungrymonster
The interior is in all ways BeautifuL. \n<br />http://danielfooddiary.com/2015/07/21/creatures/
my favourite dish at creatureS! \n<br />the risotto was well-executed with luscious creamy texture. every grain was plump and absorbed the seafood stock, and it achieved the right balance between softness and al dente.
The noodles were springy and the sauce was not too thick and creamy. Being a fan of their generous servings of zucchini makes the dish more appealing. However, a 40 mins wait is too long for the otherwise hospitable owner and staff\n<br />#burpple #ketohloh #8DAYSEat
The usual pairing for watermelon and feta\'s a dash of reduced/age balsamic to help bring a little more depth to the simple salad; CreatureS\' take features handfuls of coriander and mint in place of the balsamic condiment, as the \'Asian\' component of their fusion dish. It may be different and look pretty - what with the bright colours - but having that much coriander caused the entire salad to taste too herby and pungent, especially without balsamic to lighten it up. There\'s a reason why coriander\'s a herb used merely for seasoning or garnishing. Having so much of it relegates the main ingredient to the background, resulting in mouthfuls of the strong herb and the occasional \"oh there\'s a watermelon!\"
Featured here\'s the Prawn Ravioli that uses wanton wrappers in place of the usual pasta. Stuffed with a creamy prawn filling, the interesting ravioli is served with a ginger-garlic-thyme butter sauce and topped with toasted pine-nuts. I love how generous CreatureS is with the huge prawn filling; but this comes off as a one-dimensional atas shui jiao to me. The butter sauce isn\'t as fragrant as imagined - an infused browned butter sauce may be more ideal. Using wanton wrappers means they have to work extra hard to still stay true to the dish\'s Western roots, which unfortunately they didn\'t manage to pull off here.
This was done in the non creamy traditional way with bacon bits, zucchini, egg yolk and grated Parmesan, without adding any cream or milk. It has a creamy, velvety consistency that coated every strand of pasta, with the saltiness from the bacon and parmesan. Wasn\'t really a fan of it but Is definitely suitable for those who prefer a much lighter and healthier version of Carbonara.
This is one awesome \"BABI\" that captivated my heart at CreatureS, even better than the prawn ravioli I had the other night! Every bite in this wonderfully rich and sweet tender meat yields a burst of flavor, with layer of fats that melt in your mouth. Seriously I can easily have 2 bowls of rice to go with these flavorful pork belly!
indeed living up to its name to create east-meets-west kinda food with Asian flair. \n<br />the hearty marination was an assault of richness and flavour with alluring aroma. the meat was so soft and tender, together with the thin layer of fats (collagen) that melts in my mouth. \n<br />finished off the meal by dipping the baguette with the sauce. this is oh-just-so-good!
It was cooked perfectly al dente, with each grain offering a little resistance to your teeth. This creamy risotto is comforting without being too heavy, and is just the right thing on a cool night.
3 ways of eating this slow-roasted pork belly so you\'ll never find it too heavy, especially when you dip it in their broth as it cuts away the saltiness of the pork skin. So fancy! #vscofood #burpple
Opening their doors at the culturally rich Desker Road is CreatureS, a a modern-day caf√© with a gorgeous interior best described as \"chillax sexy rainforest chic\". Drop by after work for a drink on their balcony at sunset, then adjourn inside for a meal. The menu is full of gentle surprises, with unexpected Asian twists that seem to genuinely come from the heart. Go for their Prawn Ravioli ($22) ‚Äî prawn filling encased in silky wanton wrappers, and bathed in a heavenly ginger-garlic-thyme butter sauce. Their Seafood Risotto ($30) boasts beautifully fragrant rice that gives you a hug on the inside, and is perfect for sharing between 2. You\'ll want to save space for a slice of their moist chocolate cake served with salted caramel, creamy coconut ice cream and topped with Himalayan sea salt.  Always call in advance to make reservations!
Filled with bites of meaty prawns coated by egg white and cream, wrapped in wanton skin instead of using pasta sheets. The ravioli turned out delicate and slippery silky smooth, great together with the garlic ginger thyme infused brown butter sauce that added a nice herbaceous note. It is served with toasty pine nuts that added some texture too and a generous sprinkle of ground black pepper over it. I really liked the components to this pasta dish and was full of warm &amp; hearty flavours with depth. My favorite main of the night!
One of the must have item in CreatureS.
The tomato-heavy seafood broth was comfortably light and the rice had sufficient bite, but the medley of seafood probably took a delayed flight. 3.7/5 
the exquisite chocolate cake was incredibly moist with rich layers of chocolate tiered within the smooth and fluffy cake. drizzled with sea salt, it triggered the subtle sweetness of the intense chocolate flavour and teased my tastebud. \n<br />pairing it with the not-overly-sweet salted caramel and ice cream created a timeless flavour with a perfect bang!
(Can\'t really remember the exact words) \n<br />Prawn Ravioli ($22) - The favourite and crowd pleaswr of creamy prawn filling with wanton wrapper drizzled with ginger-garlic-thyme BUTTER oil, scathered with micro greens. \n<br />Moral of story - don\'t judge the ravioli by its wrapper üòÇ
Buah keluak (indonesian black nut) served on roti prata. Interesting combi but it really works!! No bitter taste ..it kinda remind me of dark dark chocolate. Must order!!! #buahkeluak #rotiprata #singaporefood #sgblogger #newrestaurant #burpple #openricesg @fortheloveofcreatures
It is further heightened by the added crackling sensation of the deep fried crispy keropok for the entire salad. This fun combination of ingredients comes together beautifully, offering us a pleasing mix of flavors and textures on our palette.
The fleshy, wet miso cod executed its duties with poised reliability whilst the shrimpy, flossy balls smelled like they had spent the afternoon rolling around at 328 Katong. 3.7/5 
Showcasing one of my favourite dish from them - Seafood Risotto($30) \n<br />The broth with the rice and that splash of garlic oil was so so good!!! And check out that generous amount of seafood piled on top! \n<br />The scraping of the spoon was heard as the avid risotto lover (namly me) greedily clean the plate üòã
Ginger garlic thyme butter sauce with pine nuts? Yup, sold. The prawn filling and nicely slippery smooth wanton wrapper makes a very good ravioli, but seriously, the sauce is king. If you don\'t know what to order here, this is it. I know I\'ll be back for this. 
Instead of using pasta sheets, the creamy prawn filling was encased between two thin wanton wrappers. The garlic, ginger and thyme-infused butter sauce was simple yet hit all the right spots. This was defo my favourite, although a handful of dishes we wanted to try were not available. 
You can barely taste the supposed infusion of lemongrass in the stock, but perhaps that\'s due to the intense richness of the seafood flavour. The arborio rice grains were cooked a little bit past al dente but still had a nice bite to it. 
.\n<br />Version 2.0 of our favourite cake in @fortheloveofcreatures. This version added the contrasting texture of moose in the cake to enhance the flavour of the yam paste.\n<br />.\n<br />The White and Purple glace sure add a modern sophisticated feel to the cake, but the Version 1.0 still have my vote. Kudos to them in creating the new version.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #huffposttaste #nomnom #STfoodtrending \n<br />#topcitybites #vscofood #foodoftheday #fdprn #orhnee #orhneecake #yam #yamcake

Ayam buah keluak (chicken with indonesian nuts).\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />A long and tedious misen place (preparation) before the actual cooking. Nuts are scrubbed to rid of soil and dirt and needs to be soaked in water for at least 3 days (with in between scrubbings). Sambal chilli are prepared manually which is the base of the gravy.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ The black ingredient on top is the buah keluak paste. It has a bitter creamy aftertaste. But when mixed into the gravy, the finish is nutty with heat coming from the sambal. I liked this version as it had a spicy kick and chicken just falls off the bone. Gravy not too thick. Goes super well with fluffy white rice or even bread. A burst of salty bitter spicy creamy goodness.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Some do not fancy the bitter taste. But as you take spoon after spoon, it kinda grows on the palate and afterwhich it is simply heavenly.
For the east-meets-west Garden Risotto, I enjoyed the generous chunks of crabmeat (chewed on the shell a few times though) and the sweetness from the blue swimmers crab broth.\n<br />-\n<br />However at the same time, I get confused by the asian elements (pork lard, ginger, wolfberries) all dished into this plate, every taste comes together. A whole salted egg yolk was added and I mashed it to blend with the risotto which results in an inconsistent saltiness (am I supposed to take a bite of the salted egg yolk each time?). Granted that this is a dry version of risotto, the rice was cluttered without the broth bathing each grain of rice.\n<br />-\n<br />Perhaps it was experimental; perhaps trying too hard. Perhaps for the $34++ price tag, I was expecting a little too much.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #exploresingapore  #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #foodetection #foodinsing #wishuponatart_eats

CreatureS first time debut of its Mao Shan Wang snowskin durian mooncake. Made entirely by hand......durian paste from actual durians, the skin stained with natural color from blue pea flower and assembling in custom made mould. The color resembles the porcelain from the Ming Dynasty.\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />The skin has a nice soft mochi like texture. Durian paste smooth and creamy. No preservatives added. It is so good that I actually finished a whole mooncake on my own ... of course with alittle help from sipping the oolong tea aptly named \"the moon represents my heart\" (yue liang dai piao wo de xin).\n<br />üîπüîπ\n<br />A dainty and somewhat luscious gift for the mooncake festival. A box of 4 costs $80.

Some loathe it. This is a must have dish when one visits a Peranakan restaurant. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Ayam Buah Keluak. It takes days of misen place (preparation). Scrubbing the nuts and soaking it for at least 3 days before the real cooking gets started. The flesh in the nuts are jet black. It is bitter. Most places would dig out the flesh and blend it with minced meat making it more palatable. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Having it with steamed white rice, gravy splashed over, the taste is heavenly.... well at least to me. Perfect marriage of slight spicy, a tinge of bitter and nutty aftertones. It is truly an acquired taste. But allow your tastebuds to feel the bitterness, and as it slides down.. the nuttyness sort of floats on the tongue. It is not so bad but rather it is amazingly delish. Here at CreatureS, the dish was done very well. Tender chicken pieces with a thick creamy gravy. Just this and rice, amazeballs!
With compliments from @its.a.dennis.world @fortheloveofcreatures this affogato was absolutely what I needed after chowing down the hokkien mee. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Coconut ice cream was smooth and pleasing to my sweettooth. The espresso strong and bitter, a perk up for my sleepy self. The finish was divine, at least to me, a tinge of roastyness that was so comforting.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Thank you, Dennis, for complimenting me with the sweet ending &amp; putting a smile on my face. A big big congrats to you and KK. It is official! CreatureS was voted as one of the favorite restaurants 2017 by Singapore Tatler. Weeping tears of joy as your hard work paid off. Big big hugs coming your way! Love you guys to the moon and back.
Hokkien mee garnished with pork, crayfish, tiger prawns and squids.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Looking so vibrant and psychedelic. The fragrant aroma of alittle wokhei exuding out and then dissipating in the air. The gravy simmered from prawn heads, crab shells &amp; prolly some secret ingredients was indeed flavorful. Generous servings of seafood prostrated over the soft but no so aldente noodles. The ikura was delightfully invigorating. When it pops, i went like \"wooo... \" on my palate. The crunch came from the sinful pork lard which was crispy but yet so melty. Low sodium is always a hit with me. üî∏üî∏\n<br />I slapped loads of homemade belachan into the bowl and tossed it like pasta. Yes.. another level of yumminess. The bestest part was all the delectable bits and pieces of remnants which included the lard, the garlic, the mushy eggs all submerged in the thick rich gravy. I call this the \"climax\" of this mountain of goodness.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />The belachan, however, I preferred it to have more heat. But not everyone can take the level of spiciness that I am accustomed to. Overall, a beautiful bowl of hokkien mee.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Launch for tonite\'s dinner service and available only during weekends. Limited portions are lovingly prepared each day. So to avoid any disappointment, make reservations. \n<br />Useful tip : when you reserve a table, reserve a portion of the hokkien mee at the same time.
The thin skin blanketed the creamy avocado mousse while the mousse warmly embraced the paste within. Sweet, zingy and chocolaty... 3 flavors to suit the sweettoothers, the zingers and the chocoholics.\n<br />üîºüîΩ\n<br />Official launch of these seasonal delights is just hours away.  Find them at CreatureS, 120 Desker Road on 17 Feb.
Looking like gemstones and aptly named after gemstones. It shines, it glimmers and it shows off its smooth vibrant skin.\n<br />üîºüîπ\n<br />Each one has 3 layers : the mochi like skin, avocado mousse and each color represents the different flavors.\n<br />Jade (green) is an oriental creation. Within the avo mousse, is the roasted black sesame. Roasted, grinded by hand and cooked till it becomes a smooth paste.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />Amethyst (purple) is refreshingly tart. Deep in, tangy berris coulis with a pitted cherry. This is however, my fave among the 3. Clearly a palate cleanser and is the lightest among the 3.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />Garnet (red) is chocolate married with macerated pomegranates.  Oh... macerated means soften or softened by soaking in liquid. The pomegranate seeds; thats where all the antioxidants are; were processed into teeny bits thereby creating that crunch. For this very avant-garde creation, it is a taste for the discerning palate.. or rather an acquired taste. Interesting!\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />The skin were soft and gelatonous, does not stick to your teeth. Avocado mousse, creamy and silky, a superfood known to reduce bad cholesterol. What I loved was every component was made inhouse and by hand.\n<br />üî∏üîπ\n<br />The 3 beauties make its glam debut on 17th Feb. Limited quantities are made fresh each day. Please call in advance to reserve. By whatsapp/sms : 88763670;\n<br />Call : 62916996\n<br />Address :120 Desker Road

Very well cooked pork collar, fried to absolute perfection, and topped off with their amazing Rempah! Their belacan also damn shiok!
how to eat this? Where should one start?? No... one is not able to take a bite that is with everything in between unless you have a very flexible jaw.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Allow me to formally intro this black beauty hunk of a burger. \"Zhu burger\" (zhu in mandarin means pig). A thick juicy pork patty which was marinated with their inhouse sauce. Sweet and sour finish. Garnished with fried egg, cheese, pineapple puree, onion and tomatoes all lovingly tucked in between soft &amp; crisp charcoal .. loving the blackness of the buns which looked so seductively enticing. So classy and sexy even!! If this is not already a mouthful, mesclun salad and crispy fries are served on the side.\n<br />‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />Now to eat this. Logically, start from the top and chow down layer by layer. Dont be afraid to get your hands dirty. I tell you, I love messy and messy taste good. But this is just me, the not so ladylike side demolishing every morsel on da plate.

Loved how it was rolled with sliced cucumbers and held together with thin rice paper. Rice was soft and fluffy whilst the chunky chicken pieces laid snugly inside. üîºüîº\n<br />My way to eat this was to get my fingers dirty. Get a piece and dip into the chilli sauce or the onion oil. I dunked mine into sweet black sauce then chilli. Do away with cutlery. Ignore table etiquette. Ignore the stares. Somehow food taste better without stainless steel kissing my food! üîºüîº\n<br />Impressed with the plating. Great service as always. Very attentive staff. Felt like a princess leh @its.a.dennis.world @fortheloveofcreatures
Impressed by the large portions and tangy tamarind gravy!

The layered thick Mao Shan Wang durian paste and clumps of the pungent fruit‚Äôs flesh is also divine.

Tossed in aromatic shallot and light soy. So simple yet comforting.
The flaming sunset bowl of thick broth offers a distinctive dried shrimp and rich coconut milk and spice. The amazingly tasty quintessential nonya laksa will tickle the tastebuds and leave you wanting for more. Served with al dente thick vermicelli and yellow noodles.\n<br />.\n<br />#Gastronome #Wanderlust #GirlsOut #igsg #sgig #instasg #instafood #foodporn #sgfood #sgfoodies #foodgawker #foodspotting #beautifulcuisines #burpple #8dayseat #whati8today #fortheloveofcreatures

The braised pork belly is soft and melts in your mouth. The french baguette is a more than able substitute for the white and fluffy bun to complement the scrumptious gravy
Decadent chocolate cake dusted with Himalayan salt with coconut ice cream and salted caramel sauce. This is to die for..
You can relish the tantalizing egg yolk that is coated on each strand of the pasta. Even without any of the other ingredients, the linguine will not fail to amaze you.\n<br />Will definitely patronise them again just for this dish
Fantastic combi of bitter sweet &amp; salty. One of the better üç∞üç´ i have tasted. Quite a substantial size so best to share among afew. #chocolatelovers #chocolate #cakes #cakelovers #dessert #burpple #openricesg #nomnom #sgfoodie #bloggerssg #cafehopping @fortheloveofcreatures

spa like interiors giving diners a warm yet cosy feel, service was excellent but the food left a lot to be desired.
Doesnt look very pretty. On the right is a deconstructed or nee (taro) cake with shredded coconut &amp; the other is a durian cake with delectable durian bits. Both are not overly sweet, best of all after the dinner one can still stomach these cos it is very light n spongy accompanied by special blended teas or coffees. #durianlovers #duriancakes #taro #cakelovers #dessert #sgfood #foodblogger #nomnom #burpple #openticesg @8days_eat Thank you Dennis @fortheloveofcreatures for a wonderful gastronomical experience. Cosy ambience and superb serviceüòÑüòÑ
Cos the main criteria is the \"crackling\". The pork is abit on the salty side so to balance it off, dip it in the sweet black sauce..just a teeny bit will suffice. #cracklingpork #pork#dinnerwithfriends #singaporefood #sgfoodie #sgblogger #foodblogger #burpple #openricesg @fortheloveofcreatures
A different take on our local yong tau foo. These vegs are stuffed with feta cheese. No sweet sauce no chilli. Wonderful dish i might add. The sweetness from the üçÜüçÜeggplant, the spiciness‚ô®‚ô® from the chilli and the slime from the okra ...an explosion of flavors on the palate in a good way #yongtaufoo #eggplant #okra #dinner #vegetables #singaporefood #sgfood #sgblogger #burpple #openricesg @fortheloveofcreatures
Quite a substantial size for the cod. My take on this was that probably it was baked for a short while then finished off with a little grilling to get the charred texture. Whichever way it was delish!! üòãüòã The nasi ulam which are the round balls topped with shredded coconut  was good but with abit more herbs...it will be perfect.#cod #miso #rice #coconut #newrestaurant #sgblogger #burpple #openricesg @fortheloveofcreatures

Thank you Dennis for having us to celebrate with you! Finally your dream came true after many years of planning! Congrats!
The Burpple team are the first customers at CreatureS, which is all chillax and rainforest chic. This is their roast duck and pear salad, which has a most addictive duck skin. Can\'t wait for the other dishes to arrive!
