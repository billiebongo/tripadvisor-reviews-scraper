The green one is unmistakably the {Ultimate Durian Mooncake}, made with premium A grade 100% pure Mao Shan Wang durian. It was so good that this was the first to be polished clean from the plate!

[Media Tasting]\n<br />Mini Snowskin Mooncake with Rose Lychee that was light &amp; refreshing on the palate. Sweet tangy flavour with a Raspberry Jelly Centre that complement the mooncake overall very well !\n<br />Going for $62 - 8pcs
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Being partial to snowskin mooncakes, these mini Rose Lychee ones with Raspberry Jelly had me hyperventilating even before I took my first bite. \n<br />If you get equally excited over light mooncakes, this new flavour could very well hit your sweet spot. The soft skin is perfumed with a VERY strong rose scent, while the fruit jelly centre is a refreshing juicy complement.\n<br />For those who are keen to try, the good news is Peony Jade has just launched them in a set of 8, priced at $62 nett.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Please excuse the mess but just take at a look at these beauties: the Traditional Teochew \"Orh Ni\" Mooncakes from Peony Jade. They truly live up to their legendary award-winning status with that \"fall-apart-at-the-slightest-touch\" flaky pastry and a filling of ultra-smooth premium pumpkin paste with big chunks of salted egg yolk. I love that the paste is moist and of a well balanced sweetness, making it a heavenly match for the light pastry.\n<br />.\n<br />Between now and 15th September 2016, these, as well as a whole assortment of other baked and snowskin options, are available for purchase.\n<br />For enquiries and pre-orders, please call the Peony Jade Mooncake Call Centre at 6659 4159. Operating hours are: 9am to 7pm (Mon to Fri) and 9am to 1pm (weekends and public holidays).\n<br />Or visit www.peonyjade.com for more details.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />I couldn\'t wait to sink my teeth in the seasonal special of Salt Baked Hairy Crab. Half the fun was getting to play Thor - wielding that big silver hammer to smash open those \"hard rocks\" because that\'s the only way to gain access to their precious content. Now who says you can\'t play with your food? 😆
Very generous amount of pineapple fillings. And most importantly, the fillings are very nice! 😋
Like a souped up version of longevity noodles that are normally served during Chinese wedding banquets, this was so good that I couldn\'t stop reaching for second and third helpings of the braising sauce infused noodles with scattered bits of minced pork and mushroom.
Addictively crunchy deep fried salmon skin drizzled with luscious salted egg sauce. One of the better renditions of this I\'ve had in a while.

Oh so tender Duroc pork that’s roasted in-house at Peony Jade. This is definitely one of my favourite dishes as the sticky, sweet honey-glaze is super addictive.

4.5 munchies: Slightly charred and glazed with honey, the sticky char siew was so juicy, so yummy. Known for its rich marbling and tenderness, I loved how the rose-infused Spanish Duroc was neither too fatty nor lean and had a good fat-to-meat ratio. Quoting Veronica, the char siew served here is better than the one at Char! I\'d also highly recommend the Soy Sauce Kampung Chicken and Zhenjiang Pork Ribs.
available in their dim sum ala carte buffet menu, this is their version of 流沙包 (custard bun) Not only did it get all the \"ooos\" and \"ahhs\" from the table, but this was super delicious!! be careful of the custard as it oozes, you have been warned 😊

I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />I\'m usually not a fan of \"char siew\" but this Rose Infused Honey-glazed Barbecue Pork was impressive enough to make me wrestle others for it. The use of Spanish Duroc Pork, which is known to be juicier and tenderer than ordinary pork, proved the perfect canvas for the marinade to do its magic.\n<br />After tasting this and several other dishes today, I am not surprised that Peony Jade has made it to the Michelin Guide Singapore\'s Bib Gourmand Awards list.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Jawdrop Alert: Get a whole Soya Sauce Chicken for just $12++!\n<br />No, I am not kidding and neither is there any hidden cost. This is a genuine value promotion with a simple reason - Peony Jade is celebrating their 12th anniversary! And that\'s why they are offering 12 signature dishes at a flat rate of $12++ each (however, every table is limited to a maximum of 2 dishes from the list). According to the manager Francis, this chicken dish was cooked using the traditional way like they do in Hong Kong. The old style obviously works best because the meat was downright tender, juicy and full of flavour all over. Even the breast meat was moist. If you want to try this for yourself, don\'t hesitate too long because the promotion ends 12th August 2016.\n<br />With Peony Jade at Keppel Club\'s recent inclusion on the Michelin Guide Singapore\'s list of Bib Gourmand Awardees, it really seems like this restaurant is on a roll. No better time to check it out if you haven\'t been before. And if you have, well, perhaps a revisit is in order 😄
Pick me!\'\n<br />Delicious salted egg yolk buns (front) and molten matcha buns (rear). Not shown in the picture is their core oozing out... Cute and yummy. :) Happy dessert for the day! \n<br />#peonyjadekeppelclub #peonyjaderestaurant #dimsum #jiakpahliao #fatdiemesiboh #burpple
Great value for money....till the price of the other dishes completely negated it 😅 Both were very yummy though! :) #burpple #foodporn #foodspotting
These little piggies are filled with porky goodness from head to tail. Not made with the usual char siew, these cuties are made with actual juicy honey glazed BBQ pork 😋
Having dined there previously, I truly enjoyed myself with the selection and quality of food served. The restaurant will be rolling out the “Good Morning” New Dim Sum menu and two of the items include the Tweety Birdie (3 pieces for $10) and Steamed Piggie Cha Siu Bao (3 pieces for $7.50).
One such dish is the Soya Sauce Chicken, which is a whole steamed kampong chicken flavoured in premium dark soya sauce. Originally priced at $48, its only selling for $12/set during this promotional period. I just love the tender chicken that has been doused in the savoury sweet soya sauce. There’s even braised peanuts at the bottom, which makes you want to grab a bowl of porridge to go with it. So what are you waiting for? Hurry head down to Peony Jade today!
Bite into the pretty pink skin and you\'ll find slips of chicken and black fungus flavoured with Chinese wine.
I like their Chinese name called 一籠八戒. 😅😅 Filled with Juicy Honey Glazed Bbq Pork &amp; Bamboo Shoot in Premium Oyster Sauce.\n<br />.\n<br />Available @peonyjadesg priced at S$6.00 for 3 pieces\n<br />.\n<br />#peonyjadesg #dimsum #chasiubao #burpple #burpplesg
Dim sum is one of the best way to start weekend with especially when there\'s such beautifully crafted ones. Tweety Birdie as shown is baked pastry crust filled with slight sourish pineapple jam, pretty similar to pineapple tarts that we eat during CNY except flakier crust and of course much cuter. Enjoy 15% off for the weekday and weekend Dim Sum Buffet Lunch when you spend minimum $180. T&amp;Cs apply.\n
3.5 munchies: Double-boiled for 4-6 hours before serving, the mature hen (老母鸡) stock was richly-flavoured and intensely fragrant. Infused with Yunnan-imported black garlic, the clarified soup was sweet and savoury with hints of balsamic vinegar. Unfortunately, I wasn\'t able to appreciate the slight fishy taste and rubbery texture of the American conch found in the consommé.
We ended our meal with 3 desserts on a plate. My favorite of the three would definitely be the deep fried sesame molten dumplings filled with taro paste and salted egg yolk. The sweet taro shell was chewy with fragrant sesame seeds and the all time favorite molten salted egg yolk was a perfect match! The coconut ice cream and steamed molten choc-on-bao were nothing to shout about. 
I\'m usually not a fan of Chinese desserts but this deep fried sesame molten dumplings with taro and salted egg yolk was enjoyable for me — the sweet taro shell was a little chewy with fragrant sesame seeds and the all time favorite molten salted egg yolk was a perfect match! 
A roasted crispy chicken stuffed with glutinous rice and preserved meats. It looked very unassuming on first sight but we changed our minds after having a bite of it. The roasted chicken was so moist, tender and covered with a layer of crispy skin. The glutinous rice stuffed on the inside was extremely fragrant! It was a little on the oily side but I believe this is how it should be like! We easily wiped this out within minutes even after having several dishes before this.
This tea-pot soup is usually served in a tea-pot as shown above and poured into a small cup. Diners will then be able to enjoy the hot soup in small gulps to truly appreciate the essence of the soup. This double boiled conch consomme with black garlic had pieces of pork and chicken in it. I could taste the depth of its flavor that could only be achieved from long hours of boiling. The addition of black garlic gave it a very smoky fragrance that I thought worked quite well!
The appetiser platter was made up of 3 dishes — the Marinated Drunken Clams, Chinos Salad and a Crepe with Crispy Suckling Pig and Otah. Even though I don’t usually take cockles, I didn’t mind having it as it was heavily marinated with a spicy sauce. I can only imagine how fans of cockles and spice can fall heads over heels for this! The chinos salad had shredded duck and a citrusy sauce to go with it, which delivered refreshing tangy notes to the dish! Perhaps the most disappointing item was the crepe. While it sounded very promising with the crispy suckling pig, I found it to be tough and chewy. The presence of the otah also did not feel quite right with the sweeter sauce in the crepe.
Thin crust and tasty ingredients. Very well done. Yummy yummy yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2016 February 28
Peony Jade\'s Keppel Club outlet (the other is in Clarke Quay) is a good option for a weekend dim sum buffet brunch ($31.80 for adults and $19.80 for children under 10 years, minimum four diners)  away from city crowds. Available from 11:30am to 2:30pm, expect the best of Peony Jade\'s signature handcrafted Hong Kong-style dim sum — think barbecued pork buns, siew mai, molten salted egg yolk buns and pan-fried carrot cake in X.O. sauce. There is also a decent selection of seasonal greens and roast meats, along with hot and cold desserts — try the yam paste (orh nee). Park at the multi-storey carkpark before the main Keppel Club entrance.\n<br />Price: $31.80 per person
(Peony Jade Restaurants remain open throughout the Lunar New Year period 👍🏻) I\'m already full after finishing the whole individual pot or rather I cannot even finish 🙊 ⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎⚎ Apart from yusheng, poon chai is another must-have in this CNY celebration and because of the ingredients used in the poon chai, it doesn\'t come cheap. Therefore it\'s really good that poon chai here at Peony Jade comes in individual portions! Executive Chef Liew used 12 premium ingredients in this pot of poon chai: shaved black truffles, 6-head whole abalone from Australia, dace fish (red grouper), shrimp balls with Foie Gras, fresh plump scallops, spikes sea cucumber from South Africa, king-size prawns, shiitake mushrooms premium golden oysters, de-shelled crab claws, high- grade fish maw, taro and broccoli.
AND they will be open throughout the Lunar New Year Period!\n<br />Named as Triumph ($88.88 per pax with a min. order of 2 sets; $498.88 for 6 pax and S$698.88 for 10 pax), 满载而归珍饈, it uses ALL my favourite ingredients. \n<br />The individual serving with 12 premium ingredients can already fill up my capacity with all the goodness in a treasure pot. What is special from the usual Poon Choi is the inclusion of Foie Gras, which is uncommonly found in Chinese dishes. \n<br />Other quality dishes include the usual red grouper fish, scallops, sea cucumber, golden oyster shitake mushroom, 6-head whole abalone, king-size prawns, de-shelled crab claws, fish maw, taro and broccoli. This is then doused with shaved black truffle. \n<br />Thank you @peonyjadesg and @37comms for the hosted meal!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Triumph aka 满载而归珍饈, is filled with some of the finest ingredients you can find such as black truffle slices, 6-head Australia abalone, plump scallops, shrimp ball with foie gras etc. Unique point is the truffle sauce, giving this dish an alluring aroma.
Shaped like a prosperity gold bar, it\'s made of 100% Mao Shan Wang Durian and Nian Gao 😍 The harmonious marriage of decadent flavors, served cold, will be a great dessert for CNY dinner.
This is 1 of the 8 festive dishes that @PeonyJadeSG is offering this CNY! If you love truffle, you got to try this because it is the REAL DEAL. 😋👌🏻 .\n<br />.\n<br />You can expect 12 premium ingredients in each poon choi. 😍 Such as the black truffle, abalone, scallops, crab claw, sea cucumber shrimp balls with foie gras and many more! 👍🏻 It comes in individual serving size as well as sharing portions!😉 Head to www.peonyjade.com to find out more!☺️ Ps: Peony Jade is open throughout the entire CNY to serve you better!😊👍🏻
With truffle slices, abalone, de-shelled crab claw, scallop, prawn ball with foie gras filling. All the goodness you could think of on a claypot. Peonyjade has rolled out their cny menu!!!

Besides, the Instant Enormous Windfall, Good Health &amp; Longevity Yu Sheng, we had Triumph Premium Braised Poon Choi, Progress &amp; Advancement Wealth (lobster with egg white) and Abounding Weath ( Suckling Pig stuffed with glutinous rice) &amp; Triumphant Desserts Buffet. What is your fav dish for CNY? I am a sucker for cny cookies and nian gao, you?
Both the lobster and noodles are deliciously great. They can be eaten separately or together it\'s still great. Yummy yummy yum yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 December 31
This Chinese restaurant serves good lamb chops. Tender and juicy chops with equally good onion rings. Yummy yummy yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 December 31. 
Steamed and deep fried fish all in one dish. Excellent idea. Both ways are good as this fish can be done well either way. Yummy yum yum. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 December 24
Taking a break from planning my trip\'s itinerary and indulge in Peony Jade\'s 100% PURE PREMIUM Mao Shan Wang Durian mooncake ($85 for a box of 4). Yummy durian filling wrapped in the chewy organic Pandan snowskin, just taste so awesome~
This year no surprise too.😊 Here are some non-mainstream mooncakes from @peonyjadesg .\n<br />1. Mini century eggs pastry mooncakes ($62 for 8 pieces) \n<br />2. Baked mini egg custard mooncakes ($62 for 8 pieces) .
My favorite among all. Soft carrot cake fried to perfection. You\'re able to taste the \"wok-hei\" and not to mention, plentiful of beansprouts that were crunchy as well. Oh I need another plate of this now! 
As mentioned by their restaurant manager, this is off the menu. It is one whole prawn for 1 butterfly prawn! 
The best Siew Mai I\'ve had so far! They are very generous with their prawns. How to know whether the prawns used are fresh? They\'re do not smell bad, not slimey but crunchy. 
Yup, you read it right. This is GOOSE and not duck! If you haven\'t tried goose meat before, grab this golden opportunity to have them at @peonyjadesg!
This yusheng is not only spectacular! It was so good too! Just think freshest sashimi platter of lobster, crab, prawn, salmon, tuna, sea urchin and fish roe. 😌 and it was infused with truffle oil! Omg! Can\'t blame me for overly-stuffed myself with too much of this goodness. 🙊
I wonder how much my cholestrol level has gone up since hairy crab season started.
Warm, flakey, fragrant pastry. Best char siew shou I\'ve had so far! Peony Jade Dim Sum buffet.
Peony Jade boasts a stunning menu, and is the perfect spot for a family celebration. You\'ll be greeted with an extensive menu, but you might want to feast on signature dishes like Szechuan Camphor Wood Smoked Duck and Braised Rice Vermicelli with Roast Pork, Bitter Squash and Egg Plant. End your meal on a sweet note with the ever popular Teochew Yam Paste with Ginko Nuts. If you prefer something lighter, go for their handcrafted dim sum delights like XO Chilli Carrot Cake and Siew Mai.

Hairy crab season is finally here again. These furry crabs, though only palm size small, are highly sought after for their sweet and delicate meat, and the bright orange roe. Here\'s wok fried Shanghai nian gao with hairy crab (XO 酱大闸蟹上海年糕) is wok fried in a slight spicy XO sauce. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/peony-jade-hairy-crab-2013/

Stuffed in half baby pineapple, the patty was moist and slightly fatty with fish oil. The baby pineapple was not at all astringent but was sweet and juicy with a slight acidity, which is perfect for the fish patty. The Chef has managed to harmonize all the components together using the piquant homemade rojak sauce. The black truffles, however, seems to be missing in action.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cny #chinesenewyear #lunarnewyear #pineapple #salmon

The lobster accompanying the rooster certainly injected a sense of vigour and longevity into the dish. The array of ingredients - conch, poached blue-swimmer prawns, fresh blue swimmer crab meat, salmon sashimi simply excites our appetite. Chef\'s homemade fresh apricot and peach jam dressing was refreshing, and extra crunch was lent by the crispy silver bait.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #peonyjadesg #yusheng #lohhei #cny #chinesenewyear #lunarnewyear
Indeed, everybody\'s wish comes true as we dug our fork into the pure goodness of Mao Shan Wang. It was so pure that there was even traces of the seeds being left behind. The niao gao in between was soft and blended into the durian puree seamlessly.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #peonyjadesg #durian #niangao #cny #chinesenewyear #lunarnewyear
Brimming with 18 premium ingredients, ‘Prosperity &amp; Smooth Sailing’ (玉凤凰展鸿图, 献生财聚宝) - Australian Premium Whole Abalone Poon Choi  is one of its signature ($468.88 to $698.88). I like the combination of the ingredients, such as the well braised South African spikes sea cucumber, whole scallops and pork tendons. What tasted just as satisfying as all the seafood are the well braised radish, mushroom and soft yam buried underneath the pot which have soaked up all the essences and flavours. Every order of the Poon Choi come with five complimentary yu sheng, fish maw soup, chicken, claypot rice and dessert.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #peonyjadesg #pencai #cny #chinesenewyear #lunarnewyear

I love the sweet lychee flavour and I couldn\'t resist having 2 on my own! #peonyjadesg #mooncakes #love #onmytable #topcitybites #yummy #sharefood #exploresingapore #singaporeinsiders #nikonsg #nikon5500 #burpple
The balance of sweetness is just perfect👍 Being a hoarder for mooncake boxes and I\'m glad @regentsingapore finally changed their box design after many years!🎉 #burpple
The early bird gets the worm ! If you\'re into cute and delicious dim sum, try these birdies that are made of Chinese pastry crust filled with homemade pineapple jam!🐤🐥🐣 On a side note, bite the head or the butt first? You may be in dilemma😆\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #beautifulcuisines #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #dimsum #peonyjade #pastry

Happy hump week people! Filled with honey glazed Char Siew , I\'m craving for these piggies now. 🐷🐷🐷\n<br />.\n<br />#setheats #burpple #eatoutsg #igers #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodiary #foodporn #instafood #whati8today #bestfoodworld #beautifulcuisines #exploresingapore #sgfoodunion #igers #cafehopping #f52grams #food_ilysm #exsgcafes #instafood_sg #iGersSingapore #myfab5 #eeeeeats #vscofood #visit_singapore #openricesg #dessertmasters  #foodhunting #singaporeinsiders #dimsum
On top of my favourite maoshanwang durian, it comes with Premium Cempedak, Wild Blue Berries Yoghurt and Mango Sago &amp; Pomelo, each piece per flavour. ($76 nett for a box of 4)\n<br />.\n<br />For the youthful lot 🙋🏻, the mini Snowskin with Rose Lychee &amp; Raspberry Jelly Centre or the Dark Valrhona Chocolate will bound to make one fly. ($62nett for a box of mini 8).\n<br />.\n<br />My mum loves both the 4 Heavenly Flavours as well as the mini ones, so i guess that makes her young at heart? 💞🤔 And a good thing about these mooncakes is that they aint too sweet. ✔️\n<br />.\n<br />Available at the mooncake event at Takashimaya or Tangs Vivocity and 10 other places. For enquiries on mooncakes by Peonyjade, pls call 66594159 for more details. Pls note pre-order requires a minimum of 5boxes.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @peonyjadesg and @37comms for these lovelies!\n<br />#peonyjadesg #37comms #food52 #flatlays #onthetable

my favorite has gotta be that nonya dumpling\n<br />•\n<br />good morning y\'all!\n<br />•
The hearty East meets West sauce has flavours of a rich tomato base with Chinese herbs and the musky tanginess of a BBQ sauce. Love the chunks of gelatinous oxtail meat. Accompanied with cute little fried buns to mop up the sauce. $38 (8 servings). Post up in profile link.\n<br />.
These deliciously marinated little cockles remind me of my childhood! It was so good I wanted to slurp it to the last drop 😋 @peonyjadesg @37comms\n<br />. \n<br />#peonyjade #peonyjadesg #37comms ##singaporeaneats #singaporefood #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #foodporn #foodforfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #fatdieme #burpple #instafoodsg #sgeatout
