Wow, we had an amazing brunch at Bread Street Kitchen and these fluffy blueberry pancakes with soft serve were one of the highlights along with the incredibly hospitable staff and the kid friendly welcome pack, which when included a paper sailor hat, a coloring book and some colored pencils!  The pancakes were moist and fluffy with juicy blueberries!
Cor blimey - this intoxicatingly smoky and arrestingly bitter creation is one of the most enjoyable gastronomical experiences I\'ve had in a very long time, one more startling than seeing a purple hippopotamus behind a yuzu tree. This dish is an item specially created for #NegroniWeek2017 and will only be available between 5 ‚Äì 11 June.
It\'s not bad. Skin very cripsy. Comes with some apple sauce as well as I think Brovil sauce.
Absolutely delicious...especially with the Apple  pur√©e! Just look at the beautifully cracked skin! Crisp to the max!  Good to share between two person.  One whole piece for one person can be quite an overdose! üòÜ
I have been here last year, but something about this burger urged me to return to Bread Street Kitchen to have it again, even though this costs S$29.00.
And desert to finish the perfect night off. Just in time for the fireworks.
seriously, this dish is one of the best i ever tasted in my life. the beef is so tender and juicy, and the pastry is light and crunchy. give them a call a week in advanced to request their beef wellingtonüòã
Luscious flow of rich chocolate center accompanied with a comforting combination of mint flavoured ice cream to balance the fondant . Perfect way to end a meal !
Great service, great food ! Have you been to it yet? It\'s awesome !
Crispy batter fried to perfection with a well cooked fish that has similar texture to seared scallop, it\'s absolutely delicious! (I was secretly praying for a bigger portion hahaha!)
The best lunch time ever! Sooooo delicious. We ordered pork belly and roast duck. Mashed potato as side. And banana toffee pudding is awesome ! Highly recommended!
Been wanting to since visiting Bread street kitchen in London. Thought it\'ll be crowded, surprisingly MBS is pretty quiet today so I walked in and got a bar street right by a Pokemon stop! Enjoyed lunch while catching mons üòÅ #thingswillgetbettersoon #burpple @breadstkitchen

Really feeling the toil of food judging for @weekendersgp Food Mania Awards! All them food and daily gym sessions are killing me.. üò≠ Anyhow, here we have the  classic fish and chips by @breadstkitchen with a lovely crunchy batter and mint pea mash. Honestly I did not expect much from BSK because of all the bad reviews I hear from my trusted foodies but I\'m glad that i went. The appetizers and drinks were yums and their service is top notch. Mains were ok-ish but we were way satisfied by then. Heh. 1 more week to go and I\'m off food for a while. #fighting #gotim
I swear I am a sucker for flavour combinations similar to the abovementioned ingredients so much it made me order the risotto. A cheesy concoction of flavours, I liked how this was not too dry nor too mushy and despite its cheesiness, was not too hard to finish. The sage carried a texture that interestingly replicated seaweed while the chestnuts helped sweetened in a little. Squash was a little inconsistent in texture; most were soft but there was one piece which was still a little crunchy. This gets kinda filling fast, so it would be nice to share it with someone especially if you are a small eater.
Meant for the sweet-tooths, I found this a little too sweet for my liking but no doubt a delightful dessert that leaves you on a sugar high. The pudding itself was soft, carrying a really sweet banana flavour within while doused in mildly sweet musvocado caramel. Do dab some of the clotted cream onto the pudding; sure helps to mediate some of the sweetness away when it gets too much.
Delightfully crisp and tender, the crackling skin bore a savoury flavour while the pork literally melts in the mouth. The Apple pur√©e does cut through the savoury flavours, providing a little sweetness with even cubes for a bite. A pretty classic combination, well-executed.
Was asked if we wanted a side for the Dingy Dell Pork Belly, and we went for these. Portion was generous for $10, especially for rather thick and large rings which were a little sweet, seasoned with a tiny pinch of salt.
It\'s a bit pricy but it\'s a very solid piece of steak. Juicy, thick and tender. 
The potatoes was so nice. But the mustard salad was not my type of dish. The meat blended with the egg and they are mean together. What a nice dish. Cost me $17++. Not to mention the view was so nice due we are sitting the corner which can enjoy the nice view of marina bay sands. 
A bit hit and miss at dinner when we visited for the first time: the peas with the lamb weren\'t all that great, nor was the polenta. But the pork belly was great, and so was dessert. Service was great though. Tbh, I would\'ve expected more from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, esp for the prices you\'re paying (even if you are in MBS).
no one does fish and chip as good as them (recently). or at least, to me. i love the fish and chip and their bread platter which will be served to every table before their food arrives. rlyyyy of good quality. the picture above is focusing on their cod fish which was equally delicious tho. try it if you haven\'t but remember to make reservations in advance if you\'re heading over during weekends! I\'ve been patronising here quite often and always regret not making any haha... 
üòÅSunday brunch is value for money, especially for the Scotch Eggs $19 abt., English Breakfast $24abt and Sunday Roast$45. The coffe is perfect! Nice place for Sunday relax.

Needed my dose of salmon before I fly back to Perth.
Unfortunately the low point of my lunch, which was more mac &amp; cream (bechamel) than mac &amp; cheese.
Yesterday\'s birthday lunch treat to indulge my inner Gordon Ramsay fangirl. I went without overinflated expectations and I can objectively say that the food is well done for what it is.
Lobster roll\n<br />Slow-roasted Dingley Dell pork belly\n<br />BSK short rib burger
Decent mash, almost tasteless artichokes (what a waste of an amazing veg!), a tad too crunchy saut√©ed onions, and a forgettable mash. All of that could\'ve been overlooked should the cod be done well; unfortunately it was a little dry and overcoked, nothing like the prized buttery fish.
The better dishes were the starters. Enjoyed the seared scallops. #burpple

It doesn\'t just ooze chocolate; it OOZES STICKY DARK CHOCOLATE AAND SALTED CARAMEL at @bsksingapore!! Accompanied with a scoop of mint chocolate chip Icecream, I couldn\'t stop digging into it despite how well fed we were. I\'m definitely coming back for this.  Happy birthday our sweetest @junkielicious üòò
After a near 2 months reservation wait, I finally had a chance to dine at Bread Street Kitchen. If you come here expecting to get Hell\'s Kitchen or Masterchef standard, then you will be disappointed. However, if you come here with an open mind with the pure intention to try some of Gordon Ramsay\'s dishes, then you will leave a happy diner. Let\'s start off with the restaurant\'s ambience. I have heard critics saying that it\'s too noisy and you will not be able to talk with your diners. I beg to differ as I feel that the noise level is just right for a European semi-casual restaurant (this is not a fine dining restaurant). Moving on to the food, I definitely have to order the Traditional Fish &amp; Chips ($26), which is essentially a British signature. People have said that the food is inconsistent, however what I usually will tell them is to give the chefs time to familiarize with the kitchen, environment and ingredients. If you rush there during the opening weeks, it will definitely not be the best standard. My trip here was after a couple of months of their opening, and I must say that the fish &amp; chips is one of my favourites now. Their attention to details and pairing of the different elements is just impeccable from the crushed peas with mint, individual bottle of Wilkin &amp; Sons tomato ketchup, homemade tartar sauce and chunky fries. The main star of the dish, the fish fillet was crispy on the outside and lip-kissing smooth in the inside. Each table was also given a complimentary freshly baked bread basket and a slab of President butter (salted) which was wiped clean in no time. I left Bread Street Kitchen a satisfied and happy diner, and I can\'t wait for my next visit.
Here to try the dishes out. [Risotto with girolle mushroom, peas, asparagus, aged parmesan S$32]
Happy birthday to my dearest as the staff from Bread Street Kitchen took the effort to decorate our dessert with a \"Happy Birthday\" chocolate writing. The cheesecake comes with roasted balsamic strawberries which acts as a tanginess agent to cut through the richness from the cheesecake. Definitely a dessert that you can keep having without feeling the \"gelat-ness\".
Another dish that truly stands out at Bread Street Kitchen is the roasted sea trout with summer vegetables, clams in an aromatic broth. The fish is sitting atop of the clams and broth, hence, it will lose the crispiness. And, I believed that the broth has been boiled for many hours to bring out the flavours and richness. Slightly pricey but what should you expect from a restaurant opened in MBS and by a award winning chef?
Numerous negative reviews followed by inconsistency in the food and subpar service during the opening is not stopping me from paying a visit to the inaugural restaurant opened by celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay, in Singapore.

Pork chop flavours pretty good but a tad dry. Service tries to be friendly but comes across as hurried.
Believe it or not. This is the best dish I\'ve had at Gordon Ramsey\'s Singapore outlet. It\'s just a side order of the main order of fish &amp; chips. The use of kailan as a garden green is great. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 24. 
The star, to me, is the chips which are crispy outside and soft inside. The fish is too oily and drenched in it. Sad that this is GR first Singapore outlet and a simple dish like this failed. Posted by Ah Leong San 2015 August 24. 
Ordered: Traditional Fish&amp;Chips, Seared Scallops, Mash Potato, Slow Roasted Dingley Dell Pork Belly, BSK Short Rib Beef Burger &amp; Macaroni Cheese with Garlic Roasted Crumbs. Everything was overpriced but the food is extremely mouth-watering. Mash Potato costs $10, you could probably guess how much the rest of the dish costs. Had to book 5 weeks in advance just to dine-in there. I would say the food is not worth the value not because it isn\'t tasty enough, but I just personally feel its too expensive for me to dine in there occasionally. After all, its a celebrity-chef restaurant. But if you haven\'t try it yet, you should totally go one day. Its worth a try because the food is to-die-for. 
(From last night\'s pasta craving while walking around the Marina Bay area). Was a small starter portion of lobster tagliolini but it was fresh and yummy, and I loved the bread!! üçû
Mac &amp; Cheese lovers rejoice! Yet another overpriced rendition for you to get your grubby paws on. Careful not to scald your mittens on the scorching hot dishware though, as I learned the hard way. I was suitably excited as this arrived literally bubbling hot(you could see the burnished brown top layer of cheese pockmarked by pockets of heated air escaping to the surface). My approval increased as I dug into and scooped out a portionful of stringy, gooey cheese that trailed delightfully from spoon to bowl. Velvety, creamy and stretchy, it ticked off all the right boxes in terms of texture. HOWEVER, the taste of cheese was barely noticeable! A good dose of blue cheese or aged cheddar would have made this a sure winner in my books.
Bursting with the freshness of an English countryside garden in summer, the pea soup is testament to the mantra that simple ingredients executed well can make for some of the best tasting food. It\'s lush, vividly green colour is at once attractive and inviting to the eye. The emerald nectar is intense with the natural flavour of newly picked garden peas and conceal beneath its surface a delectable surprise of lobster chunks. The spicy tuna tartare with chilli, garlic, sesame oil and crispy wanton crisps fares equally well, with the marinade reminding me of Korean Gochujang paste.\n<br />Scoop up the tuna and accompanying creme fraiche with the wanton nachos for an interesting interplay of spicy, cool and crispy in your mouth.\n<br />Garden Pea Soup $18++\n<br />Tuna Tartare $19++
Lamb was very tender and the Worcestershire sauce was strong. But with more potato than anything else, it soon became very gelard. Not quite worth the $38.
Managed to get a booking in less than a week! But also guess because I made a reservation at 545pm. Was shocked by how small the fish &amp; chips was. Before I left, the table next to me was getting served fish &amp; chips and it was twice the size. Shows a lack of quality? As for the taste, it was a very average good fish and chips. Probably haddock or something. The pea mash was quite good and the tar tar sauce was home made. Will I go back again? Probably not. 
The much anticipated Bread Street Kitchen by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay finally opens its doors at Marina Bay Sands, mirroring the warehouse design of the flagship restaurant in London. Come here for the experience, but don\'t expect your socks to be blown off. That said, some dishes certainly stand out. For starters, try the Roasted Veal Carpaccio ($26) for its lovely balance of taste and texture, then go for the timeless British classic of Traditional Fish &amp; Chips ($26). Save space for their Coffee and White Chocolate Parfait ($18).
Quite unique tasting to me, the cheesecake is more of a soft pudding kind mixed with alcohol rather then an expected cheesecake texture , definitely a new experience to try. \n<br />3) Bottom left: Chocolate Fondant with Salted Caramel and Mint Choco Ice Cream.\n<br />Honestly, i like this a lot lol. Maybe it\'s the thick chocolate sauce that makes me feel \n<br />that its so good but friend was commenting there\'s better one out there? But really who can resist chocolate üòÅ 4) Treacle Tart with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream.\n<br />I love this tart, honestly. Though I don\'t know what is it, the crusty surface and the sweet tart coupled with the ice cream makes it a wonderful combo, really! \n<br />All in all, this was a wonderful meal. Definitely there are some dishes that can be skipped such as the burger and shepherd\'s pie but the rest is really worth a try! \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
As such, here is a summary of the appetizers/mains I have over here in a collage because I\'m just too lazy to post them 1 by 1 üòÅ Top Left: Tamarind Spiced Chicken Wings.\n<br />I think they were pretty good coupled with the sauce on it, even though they said spiced but the spice flavor was actually \"sweet\" rather then spicy at all, given that I can\'t even take abit of spiciness at all! Soooo savory, worth ordering! \n<br />Top Right: Pork Belly with Apple Pur√©e.\n<br />I honestly think this is the one of the dish over here that must be ordered if you are in need of a super tender meat with a skin so crispy that cracks immediately the moment you bite it! \n<br />Bottom Left: Roasted duck breast with mulled berries sauce and boulangere potatoes.\n<br />I really enjoyed this dish too. Thick, chewy cuts of duck breast. Goes well with the sauce! \n<br />Middle: BSK Short Rib Beef Burger with Monterey Jack Cheese and Mayo. \n<br />Ok, maybe because I tried before Meatliquor SIN then I came to try this one. The standard is totally different compared between both of them, the beef over the other side is so much more tender and juicy compared to this one. Definitely will choose meatliquor sin burger any time over this. \n<br />Bottom Right: Shepherd\'s Pie with braised lamb, onions, carrots, etc etc.\n<br />Nothing much to me, just nice kambeng mixed together with ingredients, abit overpriced lol. \n<br />#Sgfood #Foodphotography
Short ribs burger meat is done as we wanted but sadly it don\'t come with any sides and my kiddo bbq chicken wings is well marinated.
Mixed feeling when I make my reservation mainly because of their food and service. So I told my partner not to pin too much expectation. Thank god, my fish and chip batter is nicely done and fish remain moist. 
This was one of the best fish &amp; chips I\'ve ever had. The well-seasoned batter was thin and crispy, encasing a slab of fresh firm fish. The accompanying fries were the perfect sides to enjoy the homemade tartar sauce. Fans of mint would absolutely adore the mushed peas. All in all a fantastic dish; I simply can\'t find fault with it!
For an English Ramsay royally screwed this one up. \n<br />Dry and dense banana cake, grainy caramel, tasteless cream - is this how sticky toffee pudding in Britain\'s like? Even the local caf√©s do better than that.¬†Shame on you, Gordon.
Decided to drop by yesterday afternoon after a museum run, sat by the bar where the shutters were open to enjoy a nice breeze. Was served by a very attentive mixologist which gave great suggestions. Hence decided to return for dinner with my girlfriend. As I was already there, I decided to order a bowl of chips while I wait for her. By the time we finished our main courses (risotto and the shepard\'s pie, which were delicious!!) my chips which I had ordered before my date arrived had not arrive yet. Hence I decided to check with the waiter, he never got back to me regarding the chips. Then I asked one of the female Caucasian hosts which happened to walk by. Again, never heard back from her..finally got a hold of another host(mind that\'s about an hour and a half after my initial order of said bowl of chips) I\'ve had my main course, ready for dessert in fact. I was then told that the kitchen is now working on my chips and I\'m not able to cancels order.. WTH right? All that said, food was superb; but service needs a lot of work.
I liked this very much. The thin slices of veal were meaty and smokey, yet light and not at all gamey. The tangy pickles added a wonderful crunch and great flavour. And all that was brought together beautifully by the creamy tuna dressing. An appetiser that\'s a perfect balance of flavours and textures.
After the few pleasant reviews I read on this, I was more than a tad disappointed. The crackling was crisp and good, the meat was tender and tasty, and the apple pur√©e wasn\'t too sour - there wasn\'t anything strikingly horrid, but nothing impressive either. Apple and roast pork is such a standard and safe pairing there was nothing new brought to the dish. So it\'s not that it\'s bad, but for three thin slices with 2/3 being fats, it just doesn\'t warrant S$28++.
Lucky me! Manage to try the famous Gordan Ramsay restaurant without having to queue! There were a lot of mix reviews thus my expectations wasn\'t THAT high when I tried it. I had the roasted black cod, the lemon sauce and red wine went very well together - sweet, zesty and fragrant at the same time. He had his own surf and turf of black angus sirloin steak and half grilled lobster (green peppercorn sauce). The lobster paled in comparison to the juicy and tender beef. The Mac and cheese was good as well. 
The starters we tried were awesome, mains were decent, and desserts were way below par. While the food was considered not too bad for a casual diner, it definitely did not meet our expectations.
Cacao flakes added to give a nice texture and I do love the hint of coffee taste that enhanced the flavor of the creamy white chocolate. Not forgetting how the poached blackberries imparts a little sweetness and tartness to this dessert.
Fish was chunky, flaky and well seasoned beneath a perfect honey-coloured batter, accompanied with nicely salted fries, in house tartar sauce and crushed mushy peas with a tinge of mint in it. On the downside, the batter needs to be more crispy. Not really a mind blowing dish at Bread Street Kitchen, but it was pretty decent.
The golden brown crackling skin is crisp but super crunchy to the point where it became too hard for us to bite, which was different from what Amanda had during her first visit. The texture and flavor was still magnificent but it need a little more consistency.
Nice presentation but it was not so good how it is supposed to be in such a restaurant. The dish was so bland and tasteless, despite of chili, spring onions, parsley and white wine sauce in it. And the lobster was overcooked! It was pretty disappointing and we did not finished it after 2 mouths of it. Definitely not worth the price that we\'re paying for!
Lots of flavors going on with the sour cream complemented well with the mild spicy kick in the spicy tuna tartare and contrasts nicely with the deep fried wanton crisps. A great start of the meal at Bread Street Kitchen!
Started with this dish of chicken wings that looks very normal, but the sweet and tangy tamarind glazed flavor hits you immediately with a zing and a tinge of spice that enlivens the palate. Well marinated with crispy skin and tender on the inside, it will be better if it\'s served piping hot instead lukewarm.
This Dingley Dell pork belly was quite amazing ‚Äì good balance of meat and fat, all juicy and tender. The skin had an almost biscuit/cracker-like texture and crispness. Spiced apple pur√©e I could eat all day, every day. Ok, that\'s all.
I was quite amazed at how it\'s even possible for a restaurant to serve a burger with no embellishment. There were no fries nor side salad. Maybe I was hoping for too much. Anyway, patty was cooked to the doneness we requested #flawless-ly but a tad tasteless. I do love the spicy sriracha mayo though, and that\'s about it. Did you know that while the origin of this sauce is unknown but the contemporary version we are all accustomed to today ‚Äî the one in a red PET bottle with a rooster imagery on it ‚Äî is the creation of a California-based company? A dear friend shared this with us during lunch the afternoon of this dinner. Ok, that\'s all.
We thought it sounded more exciting but we could never be more wrong. The skin of the roasted black cod was not crisp and took a little energy to slice through as I volunteered to portion it for sharing. The crushed potatoes could do with a little more effort. I did love the artichokes though and felt the red wine and lemon sauce to be quite something too. Ok, that\'s all.
Teething problems, I guess. The Dingley Dell Pork Belly was my favourite item amongst the mains with my least favourite being the Fish &amp; Chips with its soggy batter and tough fish. The BSK Burger was  decently moist and tasty but the Cod was placed on a stodgy bed of crushed potatoes with a less-than crisp skin to boot. Not a great idea for us to check out the place so soon after opening. #foodiesg #latergram #burpple
While it is sadly just another fish and chips no thanks to its soggy batter, thankfully, the fish remains moist. It could also be the cause of the batter\'s downfall. That being said, the crushed peas scented with mint is amazing, so is the tartare sauce. The chips is chips lor. Ok, that\'s all.
Well, this here is the epitome of that, well, adage. Potted salt beef brisket that was a tad stringy, could\'ve have been cooked slightly longer so it\'d be melt-in-your-mouth. Caraway crackers, thin and crisp and with enough dots of caraway seeds for that distinctive sweet and slightly peppery aromas. What\'s interesting is the British-style piccalilli, the Indian cuisine-inspired pickled cauliflower and marrow with mustard and turmeric ‚Äì its sharp acidity brings all the flavours of the dish together. Pile them all up together and munch away. Ok, that\'s all.
BSK turned out to be pretty much what some of the food bloggers have said - patchy consistency.  There were winners e.g. Pork Belly, Sea Bass Carpaccio and things we probably wouldn\'t come back for e.g. Duck breast, pea soup.  Many of us had the roasted cod; some felt theirs bland while others found theirs too salty.  Service was slightly uncoordinated and honestly a little ill prepared for a large party (16 pax) like ours.  Teething issues, I hope. \n<br />Many thanks for the generous treat from @dashval and looking forward to @dapliew \'s :p
This flatbread ‚Äî slightly charred on the sides and very crisp ‚Äî with butternut squash and taleggio #cheese has great texture. The grilled mushroom slices were well-executed, great earthiness and maintained the juiciness. The addition of basil pesto added not only colour to an otherwise monotonous palette but so much freshness to balance the richness from the cheese and squash. Ok, that\'s all.
Very generous slices of roasted veal carpaccio, thick enough to give a good bite, cooked enough to maintain its glorious pink. I\'m in love with the tuna dressing I wish there were more ‚Äì perfect to dip with bread. Appreciate the rustic presentation very much too. Ok, that\'s all.
I believe Singaporeans in general will appreciate more lift in this dish from the Chilli which I did not discern.  #pearlsception üëâ it will be interesting to see how Chef Gordon evolves the menu here. I would hope he tweaks the menu sooner rather than later.Chef Gordon should know Singapore better after his Hawker Challenge. Since it was dinner prices for my lunch, I\'d also recommend coming here for a leisurely dinner. Or in the afternoon perhaps ard 3-6pm. üòÜ and definitely do not come here expecting fine dining. For that we await the opening of his fine dining restaurant in the not too distant future here.üòé #pearlsphotography
It was back to being teenagers, giggling and laughing all night long. There were 2 alcoholic drinks and 2 non alcoholic (complimentary when you present the MBS member\'s card). Probably the 2 who drank the alcoholic one giggled more.
I normally do not make it a point to eat at a new restaurant at their opening. I\'d rather they iron out their kinks but since I had a good  coupla reasons to make it here within their opening week, I thought I\'d have a chance to catch Chef Gordon Ramsey. Alas, he\'s flown off to continue his U.S. Masterchef work.üòÜ I say head here particularly if you wanna have a selfie and a word with Chef Gordon.üòÜ #pearlspectives #pearlsphotography
Lovely table by the window. Starters here - flavors were not too strong or overpowering. A tad too heavy with the salt though. #pearlspectives  #pearlsphotography
It was an enjoyable dinner and chef Gordon Ramsay came to the table and take selfies with each of us! (Interesting üòÇ) Those honey-glazed chicken wings with a crispy outer layers were quite different from the Korean fried chicken wings, loved its appetizing flavors!
Too many things on the menu that I wanted to try. Check out my review on the items tat we have tried.
I\'m always constantly looking forward.\" @GordonGram \'a Bread Street Kitchen comes to Singapore. If there are disappointments, there\'s always desserts to look forward to.
We totally adore this dessert, coffee and white chocolate parfait with poached blackberries ($18). It is very well balanced, not too sweet and we like the textual bite from the chocolate crisps.

Where the Fish and Chips were great and the coffee too. \n<br />My friends and I ordered the Roasted Pork Belly to share (S$29++), together with some other food that I shared in earlier posts.
The batter was light and the meat of the fish was flaky and tender. I don\'t know what they put in that tartar sauce but that stuff was amazing! The sauce was light and did not give me the \"jelat\" feeling after woofing down generous amounts of it.

Need to order this dish in advance (3days). Email them and they will send u a form to fill up.. This dish came out and look every bit as good as you can imagine.. the pastry looks golden brown and even. It is slice into 2 exposing the medium rare beef.! Upon the first bite, it tasted like steak.. a real thick slap of steak! And after a few more bites, I realize the pastry was slightly too thin as the steak overpowers every crust on that pastry. Only the \'corners\' and the \'ends\' that you can get the perfect balance of dough and meat otherwise it just feels like ure eating a 200g juicy medium rare steak.. with that said, it\'s still a good plate of dish with its juicy, perfectly executed beef and condiments plus its buttery firm pastry that I would certainly order again if it\'s not for the steep price tag\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />üîπ\n<br />#throwback#hellskitchen#gordonramsay#beefwellington#breadstreetkitchen#beef#restaurant#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#steak#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#STFoodtrending

@pkarundeng said, \"I initially thought this place was a bakery.\" Hehe. With a restaurant name like #BreadStreetKitchen, that assumption is pretty justifiable!

Lunch at bread street kitchen was fantastic. Can\'t wait to go back and try more dishes.
From the muffin to the sauce, every ingredient has been neatly assembled to bring about this beauty. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #eggbenedict #throwback
Starring 2 nicely done poached egg on toast. Paired with generous servings of bacon, a long curly sausage, tomato and mushroom with baked beans served separately. Miss my crispy bacon but their pan fried bacon ain\'t that bad. Definitely worth coming back to explore the rest of the menu. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #instafood_sg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #i8mondays
üòçüíï Featuring: Buttermilk Pancakes served with honeycomb butter, banana and maple syrup ($18) from @bsksingapore \n<br />#sgeats #breakfast #breadstreetkitchen
Very full after eating so much meat! Didn\'t like the attitude of the waitress who took our order. When we first only ordered the  Pork Belly and Macaroni, and said \"That\'s all for the moment\", she gave us a very shocked look and say \"Huh that\'s all? You all sharing?\" Is there any rule that we can\'t order first and share? Just didn\'t want to over order in case we can\'t finish cos we wanted to leave space for desserts. But the way she reacted made us feel bad and obliged to order more, so we added an order of Chicken Wings almost immediately. Such service from a celebrity chef restaurant is so uncalled for, and spoils our otherwise good dining experience! @bsksingapore #latergram #gordonramsay #breadstreetkitchensg #theshoppesatmarinabaysands #singapore #finedining #lunch #sgrestaurant #burpple #openricesg #sgig #igsg #instasg #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #instafood #sgfood #onthetable #foodphotography #foodstagram
Complimentary Butter &amp; Bread plus a welcome drink. Love the butter so much that we finished almost all the bread hahahaha! I\'m not a bread person but I must say the bread is really delicious! The Welcome Drink of celery, spinach and kale is healthy and refreshing too! #latergram #gordonramsay #breadstreetkitchensg #theshoppesatmarinabaysands #singapore #finedining #lunch #sgrestaurant #burpple #openricesg #sgig #igsg #instasg #sgfoodies #sgigfoodies #instafood #sgfood #onthetable #foodphotography #foodstagram

Looks like a piece of pork belly with open pores but it\'s taste so much better than the tart.
But but but it was highly recommended by the staff though üò≠üò≠ [Treacle Tart with Creme Friache Ice Cream S$18]
Need some of that tender and juicy scallops now!
The green pea dip was differently refreshing, tartare sauce was hands down the best
Pork belly on apple puree, salty pork + sweet apples
The sweet and tangy blend of the pounded thin pineapple and passion fruit puree is coupled with the refreshing coconut sorbet. I have not even mentioned the lime zest that is sprinkled on top of the sorbet which adds a subtle zing to it. The results are .... oh so invigorating\n<br />#ketohloh #8DAYSEat #cafehopping #burpple

The presentation of the fries in a steel cup and the crushed peas in a mini steel sauce pan enhances the aesthetic appeal of the dish. The thin batter and the sweetness of the fish is the main feature but the crushed peas are a novelty to me. However, the fish and chips I had at Greenwood Fish Bistro seems to be a notch above. \n<br />#ketohloh #cafehopping #8DAYSEat #burpple
The portion is just right and is way more generous than a few restaurants that I have tried recently. The apple puree and apple relish adds a touch of perfection to the dish as it helps to bring a variation to the flavor. I have not even mentioned the 48 hours chicken bones broth that was poured over the pork belly which makes us yearning for more.\n<br />#burpple #8DAYSEat #ketohloh #cafehopping
Impressed by their presentation and wanted to ask for a second serving.\n<br />#ketohloh #8DAYSEat #cafehopping #burpple
Maybe cos of that hint of whiskey üç∫üòãüòãüòã #vscocam #breadstreetkitchen #burpple
Great starters! Salad was disappointing to say the least though üòû
It balanced out the roasted balsamic strawberries beautifully, with a hint of premium scotch whiskey and oats added toasty crunch and flavor to it. Simple yet fabulous dessert!
Lightly salted and rich in flavour. Pretty good.
üëà this was the description off the menu but I think it was tweaked. Rather heavy with the lime here. Refreshing nevertheless.
The tastiest of the 3 starters we ordered.
üòã one of their popular mains. üòã #pearlspectives #pearlsphotography

As a Hell Kitchen and Masterchef lover, I chiong down on the first day of their operations. Check out my review! Happy Monday peeps!!! üòäüòäüòä
