There you go, I used it as a noun! For those who are not so familiar, Juyondai is a very popular brewery in Yamagata prefecture. So popular it is almost cult-like. The sake is indeed an almost perfect balance of clarity and sweetness but still coming across as bold enough.\n<br />*\n<br />I enjoyed it very much but I somehow found myself preferring a sake which is a little more bold and ‚Äòrough around the edges‚Äô to give it more character.\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @abbeycmh and Hiroshi-san (Kakure‚Äôs sake sommelier) for arranging for this bottle to be included üòâüòò.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kakure #hgfoodie_alcohol @kakuresg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
We were so excited when Chef Kazu personally came upstairs with these. The unagi was aged for a week and was full of umami flavour. Oishii!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kakure @kakuresg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Chopped fatty tuna with daikon radish in a roll. This is usually served towards the end of the meal but it remains a highlight for me. Chef Kazu‚Äôs toro taku is one of those super umami ones üòçüòç. One of my favourites.\n<br />*\n<br /> #hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kakure #kakuresg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Topped with a special sauce which made this simple dish even more yummy!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kakure #kakuresg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

This tasted as good as the signature dish we would normally have at @kishosg, which of course meant that it was amazing!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kakure #kakuresg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Thank you @abbeycmh for introducing us to an amazing sake experience.\n<br />*\n<br />This was my first visit to Kakure although I had been to its sister restaurants @kishosg and @buonaterrasg numerous times. My expectations were high as I would rank them amongst my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Yet Kakure exceeded my expectations. I love it when a sake bar serves amazing food as well. More on that later.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_kakure #kakuresg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
So yummy!
So oishii!
One of the most amazing Chirashi-bowl ever. üëçüèªüëåüèª\n<br />I would probably come back here just for this in FULL portion! ü§§\n<br />üî∏\n<br />üî∏\n<br />üî∏\n<br />#kakuresg #kishosg #sgjapanese #seaurchin #uni #sakebar #ikura #omakase #kaiseki #sgfoodie #sgphotography #burpple #city_noms #topcitybites #sgfoodie #exploresingapore #instafood_sg #instafoodie #sgphotography #exploreflavours #stfoodtrending #singaporeliciouz
