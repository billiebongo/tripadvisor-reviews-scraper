[Zhong Zhong Ngo Hiang Prawn Crackers]\n<br /> .\n<br />Tasted this plate of local dish! Include Soda Fritters and beancurd skin rolls, Century Eggs and sauces! They have an amazing sweet sauce and a hint of great spicy sauce! Well blended with all the ingredients on the plate! Whats most favourite to me was the otah! The texture was good! It was not that spicy and really fragrant! All goes well with the sauce dips and i guess its really a great snack to have while having a catch up with family and friends! Worth the try! Had this during a burpple event!
Great shoutout to the team for such a great feast and @veronicaphua for hosting this fabulous event in a very unique altas environment! Thanks for the invite üòã
Here‚Äôs a throwback to the ‚Äúngoh hiang‚Äù we ordered for Burpple‚Äôs inaugural #burpplehawmakase event at Chinatown Complex Market &amp; Food Centre. I remember thinking, amidst the busyness of that evening, how good this dish was.\n<br />We had handpicked the selection from ‚ÄúZhong Zhong Ngoh Hiang Prawn Crackers‚Äù (stall unit #02-179).  Deep-fried with care, every item was fresh tasting and didn‚Äôt have any obvious greasiness. The standouts for me were the firm, bouncy fishcake and the unique ‚Äúotak‚Äù that came partially-wrapped in leaf.
From Quality Kuih, possibly one of the very few Muslim stalls at Chinatown Complex Market. They serve quite a variety of Kuih Kuih including Ondeh Ondeh, Kueh Kosui and even a durian rendition of this.
Perfect place to have your breakfast, Mee Siam from Maxwell Ha Ha provides a delicious plate of mee siam and also mee rebus in the morning for only $2.20 or $2.50.
Truly regal in bearing, flavour, colour... Also musang kings sound like a possible band name...
ü§îüòÇ finally got my hawker food fix at Chinatown complex market &amp; Food centre, where\'s your go-to food centre??ü§ó\n<br />Hashtag #thegrowingbelly to share your meals with us! Have a good day ahead!
Glad to say this 1 Michelin star Soya Sauce Chicken\'s quality is as good as I remembered (even before it won the award)!! At $2.50/plate,  its screams \'value for money\'. QQ noodles, super tender chicken. Must order more!!!
Hello Singapore! How\'s it going? For Michelin Star food that won\'t break the bank, head over to Chinatown complex for 2 SGD Soy Sauce Chicken Rice! 
Posting this again because #BurppleSGCheapNGood $12 for this big plate of duck and braised everything!!
Simply named \'Taiwanese Food\', this stall that sits on the same row as Joo Chiat Beef Noodles fries up some of the most scrumptious har jeong kai around. A splendidly crispy batter encases the well seasoned chicken wing, resulting in flavor bombs that burst with savory flavor in your mouth with every bite. The prawn paste is perfectly fragrant, making its presence felt in every bite. When paired up with the sour and surprisingly moreish chili sauce, it hits all of the right notes on your tastebuds and creates a symphony of flavor.
They\'ve been around for a long time as The claypot rice of SG, and have maintained their standard since. \n<br />The umami of the \"chao ta\" rice against the claypot and the fragrance when all the chicken, salted fish and sausage mixed with the dark soy sauce were just all too good for words. #burpple
Awarded 1 star michelin 2 days back so we decided to have a try. Its pretty cheap with noodles cooked al dente! The base is sweet and only going $2.50 a plate yummm. Accompanying it is the sze chuan spicy wantons bought from across the stall with a china couple manning. Also delicious and only $4.50! Really worth e money and wait. 
One of the family\'s regular haunts. This time, this was where we had our final lunch together before the family flew off to Australia while I stayed in Singapore. Ah time really does fly by so quickly. 
And for those who don\'t take clams, you will get a medium prawn as a substitute. Taste is not bad and I like that it\'s not overly sweet. Unfortunately, there\'s not enough wok hei for it to be outstanding for me. So I won\'t recommend you to make a trip down specially for this but if you pass by, this is worth a try.\n<br />üçΩ\n<br />Hill Street Char Kway Teow\n<br />335 Smith Street\n<br />Chinatown Complex Food Centre #02-032\n<br />üçΩ
Dinner at Chinatown that day led us back to An Ji fish soup, which was all milky and creamy. 2 girls ordered the $8 portion, which proved to be too much, but we still finished it anyway cause it was so yummy. The egg omelette here is only so-so. The store beside it sells a better version. 
Ordered all our favourites! Sadly the yam cake wasn\'t very yammy today, but more on the starchy side. Felt like a bit too much rice flour. Hmm ü§î Popiah was still as great as usual with their handmade popiah skins! And that rich anchovy soup with their freshly fried sides! üòã Just a simple Saturday brunch w the boy!

From a stall with the very literal name \'Salted Egg Yolk Chicken\'. Value for money (I think it was $4.50?) and a great choice if you are undecided and daunted by the immense variety in the Chinatown food centre. 
Yet another delish and satisfying find at Chinatown Complex. Fresh, tender fish head steamed and drenched in a sour, slightly spicy sauce (which tastes uncannily like a sour chilli crab sauce), topped with a spoonful of freshly fried lard. The combination was addictive, we kept going for more. And the dish was cleaned up really quickly, even though I thought the portion was pretty generous. 
Lian he ben ji claypot rice: #02-198. This claypot rice is really awesome and so many patronize it. I had to wait for 45 mins to get mine. As the evening time reaches the waiting becomes longer. But it was worth the wait. You can add your own sauce. I added mine a little bit so healthier abit. Inside this mixed version has chicken, sausage, vegetables and salted fish. Really delicious. Very cheap as well for good claypot rice. At $5. A must to try!!!
Last night, I was swimming in happiness when I finally got my hands on this rare bowl of yu gai mai aka \'Fish Fillet Noodles\' from An Ji. 
Super milky looking, but no milk was added to this bowl of fish soup. The milky appearance came from hours and hours of intense cooking, breaking down the fat emulsion droplets into a consistent milky umami soup base. The fish slices sort of melts away in your mouth, so kudos to the generous folks behind the store who gave larger than average slices of fish. This allows customers to have a slight bite into the meat before it crumbles away.
Best claypot rice in Singapore. The queue can be quite long as they cook the rice on the spot. The stall\'s claypot rice has the perfect burnt taste while still being moist and the chicken is very tasty
Where to find cheap and awesome plate of noodles?the right place will be at Chinatown complex food centre. This plate of noodle cost only $3.50 with some much charsiew and chicken. This stall always have a long queue so be prepared to wait for at least 20mins. This famed stall has been on tv and many bloggers recommended it too. Despite being popular,the owners did not compromise on the quality of the meat and they all look palatable on display. I was totally surprised to know that they sell chicken rice at $2üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª. Definitely be back whenever i have a craving for charsiew
Dumplings in Red (Chili) oil ($4.50), Dan Dan La Mien ($4.00), Xiao Long Bao ($4.00)
From a stall named Dessert Station (#02-132) at Chinatown Complex Food Centre. I liked how they ask if you would prefer it with Coconut Milk instead of serving it in a default style. The coconut milk makes the subtly sweet and finely-ground paste smooth and silkier, while it came with generous amounts of gingko nuts and sweet potatoes alongside.
Curry udon at the food centre is da bomb. Cost about $5 (or is it $5,50). Super filling and yummy!
I am never a fan of Ice Kachang since young, for I particularly disliked the use of beans, corns and heavy tasting syrup and the flavours come clashing together whenever it melts, so my choice of dessert would usually be the Almond Longan which I find significantly lighter. The uncle here places each block of ice into a pail of water before shaving it; an important process to ensure the shaved ice to be smooth by bringing the temperature up for the ice block. The ice here doesn\'t clump, nor have awkward lumps while achieving just the right level of sweetness. 
bought at a hawker store , didn\'t expect this amount of generous fillings!
BEST SOON KUAY IN SG! love the sweet fillings and the perfect firm yet chewy skin!! $2.20 for 3 if i\'m not wrong!
Only tried the Chee Cheong Fun , Yam Cake and Soon Kueh cause I\'m a Pescetarian ! Their soon kuehs were MY FAVOURITE! BURSTING with sweet turnips from it\'s chewy skin! The queue was crazy long though! The dumplings had meat inside which was sad :/
$1.50 goodness! #burpple
 Jin Ji\'s Teochew Braised Duck (mediocre except for the hip molten egg), Ann Chin\'s Popiah &amp; China La Mian\'s Xiao Long Bao ($5.50 for 10 - yes anytime!)
Tried this special style of dish? Deep fried Ee mian with slice fish in black sauce. Crispy thin version of Ee Mian which totally soak in the essence of the sweet yet brings about a little saltish black sauce. Paired with slices of fish with the skin being a little too chewy though. Quite a creative and delightful dish nonetheless.
Cheap yong tay foo hand made daily and cost only $3!!soup is delicious and there are few other choices to add on like fishcake,bittergourd,bringals and mini abalone. When added with chilli,the simple beehoon just taste so good!!üëç
If there must try but stall only from 5pm to finish, maybe 7. $1
This is hard to get unless you queue before 12pm or earlier. Best char siew!! Very yummy and reasonably priced too.. For this much only $9! It\'s from the stall that sells the popular soy sauce chicken, the one with a perpetual queue! Feeling lucky!! 
Old school goodness! The green book best food award 2009-2014. Level 2,
Fortune Food just nails it every time with their consistency ‚Äì a good balance of sweet and spicy, and the all-important crunchiness from toasted peanuts and crispy dough bits. And what\'s the point of going to Chinatown at night if I don\'t get beer? Smith Street Taps was closed, but the cheap swigs at On Tap aren\'t shabby too.
There\'re plenty of options at Chinatown Complex Market &amp; Food Centre but this is the only char kway teow stall (@ #02-173). Fortunately, it was decent. Not too salty or oily. I mean they specialise in char kway teow only so what can go wrong? Ordered the $3 portion with chili but I didn\'t taste the chili at all. G commented that the cockles were cold so those who are afraid of Hep A may go for the seafood version.
This Tze Char Stall is featured in the Newspaper Lian He Zao Bao &amp; Lian He Wan Bao for rexommendation. So i decided to give it try. I order the Har Cheong Kai Aka Prawn Paste Chicken. When the Har Cheong Kai is serve i ate it it is super juicy &amp; i can taste the smell of the prawn paste. Some are salty but this one is just nice. Look like the owner know how to gauge the seasoning.\n<br />Name:123 Seafood\n<br />Address:Blk 335 Smith Street #02-203/204 Singapore 050335\n<br />Operating Hours:1700 to 2300hrs\n<br />Closed on Every Mondays
Ice kachang is always great for a hot day. Got this from ÁîúÂìÅËµû (desert station) at chinatown complex. Love the amount of red bean they have and the soft atap chees. And the sweetness is just nice without being cloyingly sweet. 
The famous and super long Q Lo Hei üêæ even Rolls Royce owner also Q there. Lol üòÅ
The perfect meal. Never thought chicken could be this succulent, and at just $7 for a half chicken?! The YTF was superb, such bouncy fish paste and totally loved the ikan bilis, can\'t imagine we\'ve never eaten YTF this way before!
Who would have thought that Ikan bilis was the secret to creating a truly out standing bowl of Yong tau foo. Ikan bilis soup stock?! Light yet flavorful, salty from the fish and not the MSG. Damn son this is yummy shit
This little nyonya @brighterstar39 sacrificed her sleep and braved the morning train crowd so that she can let me use her laptop to prepare for my presentation tomorrow. Major ÊÑüÂãï can. üò¢üò¢üò¢ Thank you so very much. *hugs* üíóüíìüíïüíñüíû‚ù§Ô∏è #followerstofriends
another popular item from the same stall - raw fish slices (È±ºÁîü). at $3 a plate, this is one generous serving of fresh raw fish drowned in sesame oil, maybe even too oily for some. tossed it up with fried shallots, crunchy lettuce, and drizzle it with that half lime for that extra zest to enjoy this chinese salad party of texture and taste.
because it was a 9plus dinner and a queue is still forming for this stall of breakfast items, so i gave it a shot. definitely some rustic taste here as i see the uncles have the chee cheong fun ready in battled metal bowls that seen better days and dicing the slab of steamed carrot cake away callously. while the chee cheong fun was mediocre, the steamed carrot cake was worth mentioning - smooth in texture and light in taste.
$5.50 for 10 xlb (Â∞èÈæôÂåÖ) &amp; $5.50 for 10 potstickers (ÈîÖË¥¥) // Loved the xlb - the skin was thin and broth was tasty!! üòªüòª The base of the guotie was crispy &amp; chocked full of ingredients! Definitely a place I would return for more xlb! üëçüëç
Finally found the noodle stall that\'s owned by the former head chef of Crystal Jade. Got their famous shrimp dumplings noodles and it really lived up to my expectations! The noodles were springy to the max and they actually drizzled the noodles with this special sauce of theirs that lifted the entire dish. They only had chilli flakes (same as crystal jade) and no chilli paste that usually comes with any noodles served dry. Since I didn\'t fancy the chilli flakes, I had to go without my usual dose of chilli (sucker for spicy stuff). However the non-spicy noodles wasn\'t disappointing at all because their special drizzle made up for it:) The 4 dumplings were huge and boy were they generous with the fillings! There\'s sufficient meat, black fungus and a freakinggggg whole prawn in every single one of them! will definitely come back for more!
It\'s not the Cantonese porridge I ate in Hong Kong :( it\'s a bit too sticky and .. Well ... Sour.. 
We had pig\'s liver with ginger and spring onion! Very tender and yet no bloody taste in it! Super nice!
But there\'s the fragrance coming outta this stall caught our attention. The uncle of this stall was trained under Chef Tham Mui Kam, one of the legendary four heavenly kings of Cantonese cuisine. We had this dish braised tofu with pork belly. I took a piece of tofu with the gravy and had my first bite. Wah! Soooo delicious!! The food was cooked in very high fiery heat which has this wok hei taste in it! My soul was instantly comforted! Claypot &amp; Cooked Food Kitchen, Level 2, Unit 83.
The best soy sauce chicken IMO! The stall\'s name is \"Hongkong soya sauce chicken rice &amp; noodles\" È¶ôÊ∏ØÊ≤πÈ∏°Èù¢ 
Old school ice kacang just with red beans, atap chee, cendol, corn, cincau and gula melaka...
They made everything from scratch! Very nice. Very cheap $5.50 for 10 pieces! In Old Airport Road Hawker, it\'s more expensive but it\'s the nicest! Also made from scratch but it\'s super juicy! Check out my older post if you\'re interested!
Some people says it\'s a mysterious stall as it does not have a fixed off day, opens at 5pm and usually everything sold out before 8pm. There\'s always a very long queue. They sells steamed radish cake and steamed yam cake. This plate cost me only $2! My friend brought me here to have this and he told me to look carefully at the cakes. I could see that the radish shreds. This means that the uncle manually shred his radish and steamed it. This is very traditional stuff and yet cheap and good! Be sure to go to Chinatown Food Centre, you can really find good eats there!
Guess how much is it? It\'s only S$13! There are many stalls that sells this, I like there are a stretch of 4 stalls but owned by two different owners. I like the one on the left. It also have crispy lard on it which bring it to a whole new level.
Sweet Potato Balls are my drugs! I\'m forever addicted to them! I love the chewiness of these!!
Stall 02-097. Really affordable for handmade quality dim sum at $2.20 per plate (3 pieces)! Char siew bao wasn\'t that good, the meat didn\'t have that extra smokiness that I like. The prawn and meat dumplings tasted fresh and were really plump! Had to wait 90 mins during lunch time on a weekend, so go there early to beat the queue!
Winner of Singapore Hawker Master (Yong Tau Foo) in 2012, this place definitely lives up to its name. It\'s one of the few places that stuffs yong tau foo pieces with their homemade fish paste, guaranteeing freshness and none of that factory-made stuff. The major draw of this place is their superb stock prepared with ikan bilis, and the generous amount of fried ikan bilis that comes with your noodles. Be prepared to queue, as with all hawker stalls serving authentic, heartwarming food. 
Honestly, this stall makes us question why people are so obsessed about techniques like sous vide. When it comes to cooking perfect chicken, there is no need for all fancy techniques. The soy sauce chicken here is simply superb - succulent, flavourful, and extremely value-for-money ($7 for half chicken; $14 for whole). Paired with noodles tossed in a slightly sweet sauce, you\'ll need a moment with this dish. They also do really good char siew and sio bak! Make sure you order enough to make your 30 minute-long wait worth it, because you\'ll definitely want more.
If you want claypot rice that\'s a cut above the rest, this is it. Cooked upon order, you\'ll get great traditional claypot rice cooked over charcoal, and the wait can stretch up to an hour. Tender chicken meat, salted fish, lup cheong, charred rice bits, excellent sweet sauce and chilli? Check. This is one of the best places you can get claypot rice at in Singapore, but don\'t go when you\'re ravenous because you might get really hangry!
The last hainanese laksa from the streets of sg past. Last day on the 30th July 2014
A satisfying toss of black sauce-drenched rice, lup cheong, salted fish, chicken chunks and spring onion. Not to mention a pretty generous portion, too, and all for $10. Stall #02-53.
I\'m a convert now! üòÅüòÅ I can only vouch for this stall though, not sure about others. üòÖ Going in to JB to source for bake-wares..fruitful way to spend my Friday!Have a good Friday everyone! üòò
Popiah was excellent. Still warm and very neatly wrapped. Dumplings were fresh and the skin was not too dough-y
Deliciously smoky pork satay that\'s nicely charred on the outside, dripping with fat and soft and tender within
Newly opened stall near the Good Beer Company selling izakaya type dishes intended to go along with beers from next door. A limited menu of 5 items with an emphasis on providing healthier alternatives, but everything was tasty and cheap! Clockwise: Japanese style Potato Salad, Hae Bee Hiam Fried Rice, Oden, Spicy Sesame Tofu with Spinach
Chinese-styled sashimi..$5 for a huge portion. Such a pity that I do not eat raw fish..But for #sashimi lovers, this would be a delight.
I like my Cheong Fan simply done, just sesame and soya sauce. That\'s how a typical Cantonese have their Cheong Fan for breakfast. This stall serves the best Cheong Fan! Soft and smooth texture. You gotta be there early, the queue starts even before 9am, and closes before lunch. Go go go!
Good morning, burpplers! This is how I start my weekend, rolling out of bed at 7am and getting down to chinatown to make my belly happy. The place is mostly filled with mummys and daddys buying breakfast for their children after marketing or old ladies and uncles that can sit for hours over their coffee. This is the closest you get to the Cantonese roots, not the atas way but close to my heart. 
Tried Popiah from two different stalls at the same time. In the foreground is Ann Chin, which is more well-known. At the background is just a random new stall. Ann Chin was the better of the two.
The porridge wasn\'t enough. Â∞èÁ¨ºÂåÖ for breakfast. Hahahahaha. I highly recommend the coffee and tea from Â§ßÂçéËå∂ÂÆ§ (located at #02-148) and xiao long bao from, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊãâÈù¢Â∞èÁ¨ºÂåÖÔºàlocated at #02-135). The coffee had a strong taste of the roasted nuts and very smooth after taste. The Â∞èÁ¨ºÂåÖ were very juicy. Becos they were chilled before they being steamed, you can easily eat them within one bite. Happy days.

roast pork rice from ‰∫îÊúàËä±
soy sauce chicken rice from ‰∫îÊúàËä±
$4
By e looks was not appealing but tasted great. One of the best yong tau foo. Queue was long but serving was quite fast. Price at $3 a bowl.
The stall \"Pig\'s Trotters Bee Hoon\" is located at #02-85. For $4 you get what you see in the photo. The noodles are crunchy and the pig\'s trotters are not overcooked. Tender meat and crunchy skin. The sauce is not overpowering but enhances the trotters. Its worth a week\'s run/swim/walk for it. 
Every time I went to eat at this stall around 1030am it\'s the last serving of the day...
Feast like a king for #breakfast. Over here at the Chinatown Market, you won\'t regret it.
Deschutes River Ale and Lagunitas Pale Ale from The Good Beer Company. Perfect with the garlic steamed fish head from next door at Chinatown Complex #02-57. Garlicky, fresh, beautiful fish. Perfect Saturday night. 
Steaming fluffy rice coated with sweet soy sauce, sesame oil and liberally studded with juicy tender pieces of chicken and lap cheong, salted fish and spring onion. Nothing beats scraping the bottom of the pot for the deliciously charred bits of sweet crispy rice! This is the stall near Good Beer Company. $28 feeds 4.
Yes, it\'s possible in Hawker Centres. What I had: Raw Fish Salad, Shared Half Chicken and Two Pieces of Popiah!
Sarawak Kolo Mee, Singapore style
Very smooth and tasty porridge is already a plus point. Add the deep fried intestines and it\'s a joy for breakfast. 
Always long queue, queued about 20mins for this. Cheap and nice. $2.50 for a big portion of chicken rice and chicken horfun
kolo mee with wanton, char siew, pork rib and fried wanton for $4.
50 Âπ¥‰ª£ Kopi. Chinatown. Nostalgia. #sgmemory
at $13 bucks, is really a bang for your bucks! comes with deadly sauce with lots of fried pork lard. be prepared for 2 bowls of rice
2Ô∏è‚É£ Sweet and Sour Pork.\n<br />-\n<br />Forget pretentious restaurants and food fads for a minute. The real deal is at this China restaurant that @ccher introduced me to a few years back.

Looks really mesmerising and tempting.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Beehoon cooked just right and beef were tender. The gravy though it had \"looks to kill\", it was just alittle too salty for my tastebuds. Go easy with the salted vegs (which is help yourself).\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Those who love anything salty, this will probably be your bowl of noodle. Just a quick lunch before hobbling down to the wet market to buy the fishies.
üå® They are so sweet with every bite, tangy and savoury from the spicy, vinegary sauce. Truly a very affordable dish at $4.50 for 10 pieces. You\'d imagine a plate is great for sharing, but nah you probably can\'t stop after one piece. üòù\n<br />_______________\n<br />Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao\n<br />335 Smith Street\n<br />Chinatown Complex Food Centre\n<br />#02-135\n<br />Singapore 089152\n<br />.\n<br />#eatbooksg #yoursingapore #ForeverHungry #hungrygowhere #hungrygowheresg #singaporefood #shiok #yum #iweeklyfood #sgfooddiary #exploreflavours #dojoeats
That‚Äôs the X-factor over other soy chickens.
Weather related‚õà. Who invented curry chicken? Absolutely comfort food.
Love the very thin and crispy pork cutlet . Stirfried eggplants soft, tender and sweet. The rest (curry chicken, long beans n taukwa) were pretty much ordinary but still good. But the plate itself actually made it look bright, appetising and tempting.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Walked 4 rounds of the huge hawker centre looking for this because somebody posted the unit number which was non existent. On a positive note, a bit of searching and walking whetted my appetite.\n<br />Stall : Dragon Village\n<br />#02-108 Smith Street hawker centre
The dumpling was ladled with Peranakan flavours, being generous in the spices and chopped pork belly! All three food items went well with the chilli and sweet sauce!
ÂÖ®ËÉΩ‰øèÂ¶àÂ¶à (Super Mummy #02-103)
One of my favourite haunts to take foreigners whenever they visit.\n<br />--\n<br />In collaboration with 7up.\n<br />This was the night when us Burpplers were overly excited tasting and retasting everything to figure out which of our local Hawker favourites paired best with the refreshing fizzy lemon-flavoured 7up. 16 excellent dishes, multiple cartons of 7ups and many Har Cheong Gais later, we have the verdict.\n<br />Top 7 reigning favourites now up on Burpple\'s website!
So I requested mine to be separated.\n<br />üî∏üî∏\n<br />Two ingredients only... curry chicken and tofu mixed with long beans and tempe. Uncle gave me five pieces of chicken. So many for a lone eater. Anyway, I liked the vibrant orange glow of the curry. Not overly lemak (coconutty). There is a tinge of kaffir lime and lemon grassy flavors. Splashed gravy over the rice and it is just yummy. Chicken alittle firm. The tofu dish was stirfried in sambal sauce. Both are not as spicy as I would like it to be. But but.... ask for the sambal belachan. It will give everything a well needed fiery boost. üî∏üî∏\n<br />This stall is tucked in a hidden corner, literally. It seems to be popular as there were a steady stream of customers trickling in by lunch peak hour. The curry chicken and the fried chicken seems to be a favorite. So if you are going to try, go early.\n<br />Stall nane : Baba\'s Peranakan\n<br />#02-225 Chinatown Complex
You can‚Äôt really go wrong with BCM
Not a fan of shui kueh in the past, used to dislike the starchy feeling, and couldn\'t find any taste to this dish! However, this beautifully plated shui kueh from chinatown complex food centre(# 02 - 43) , totally brought √© wow factor at first bite! Rice cake was smooth without a strong startchy feel! Chilli was super fragrant! Not an overwhelming kind of spicy but √© acceptable great spicyness that most are comfortable with! Accompanied by the salted raddish which was really savoury and good! This change my impression towards this simple hawker dish indeed!\n<br />.\n<br />Beautifully Plated by¬†@burpple¬†Team!

Ok, that\'s all.
Generous portion for $4, but the duck was a tad too salty. The free chicken soup was a nice touch though.

It is best had with the refreshing soup that was also affordable and comes with pork ribs and lots of watercress!
Whenever I step into a hawker centre, I feel like I\'m home.
They are also generous with the fishballs and fish cakes that came with the soup.

The nice part was its braised meat gravy, top up an additional braised egg even better. Gotta eat it with the garlic and chilli sauce for the authentic taste. Just a kueh in a bowl but this could fill the stomach for a proper meal. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #kueh
Without having to queue over 2 hours for the HK Soya Sauce Chicken Rice stall, this one from Áë™È∫ó‰∫û Ma Li Ya Virgin Chicken was just as satisfying imo. The glaze on the skin was so beautiful and shouting the fragrant flavour from soya sauce. Meat was tender and juicy, and tasted wonderful with the must-have spicy chilli sauce. Proudly good local food. #burpple #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #soyachicken

The Black Chicken Soup ($5) is the star for me at Kent Tong. The used of rice wine and XO perfumed the bowl of comforting soup as well as elevating the whole enjoyment of the herbal soup.
The old couple sells the exotic turtle soup, cooked a la minute upon order. Kent Thong Turtle Soup started in Keong Saik street before moving to its current location around 10 years ago.

Queued 30 minutes for today\'s lunch. This might just be my favourite fatty char siew($25/kg, probably one of the cheapest in Singapore!) üòç, Yee Kee would have to take the second place at the moment. As for the soya sauce chicken, Ma Li Ya Virgin Chicken still works better in my opinion as it is more tender and moist. But for $14 per whole chicken, I have nothing to complain!!Put this in your MUST TRY list now everyone!! üòÅ #DontCareCholesterolHigh #fatfatmeatseries #ssfc2015 #sg50signaturefood #jiakhiddengems\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Hongkong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice &amp; Noodle \n<br />Chinatown Complex, Block 335 Smith Street, 02-126\n<br />Open: 10.30am to about 7pm (Monday to Friday), 8.30am to about 7pm (weekend and public holiday), closed on Wednesday.
