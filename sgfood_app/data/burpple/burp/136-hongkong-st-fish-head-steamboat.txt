The Claypot Mee Tai Mak (the $8 medium portion feeds two to three) at this HDB zi char joint may not be pretty, but it\'s darn tasty and most comforting after a long week. Dive straight into the plump noodles, bathed in the bubbling, thick and flavourful broth, and stirred through with chopped vegetables, minced meat, prawns and a freshly cracked egg. Ask for some chilli padi for an added kick! Also great for sharing are the Salted Egg Pork Ribs ($10) and the Boss Bee Hoon (get the small $15 portion to share between two to three). As its name suggests, this place also does a mean traditional Fish Head Steamboat (from $23 for a small portion) ‚Äî the perfect dish to share with your family on a cool night. Pro tip: Call to reserve a table and pre-order dishes so you can dig in the moment you arrive!\n<br />Avg price: $13 per person
Brunch with momma earlier. Since we are around the area, I suggested trying the claypot mee tai mak that has been making its rounds on social media. Best decision ever.
This braised clay pot beehoon is filled with flavour, soft and a treat to the palette! Small portion at $15, it\'s reasonable and value for money.
Another item that i often see in pictures &amp; reviews. I like the salted egg sauce. Not the watery kind and you can literally bits of salted egg(?), or crumbs at least. I find that it gave the sauce some sort of texture. Would love it with more of those crumbs stuff though, like cereal prawns üòÜ
Finally tried this and it is as truly as raved - something comforting about this dish; slippery \'noodles\' simmering in a claypot of flavourful gravy with a beaten egg &amp; diced vegetables. Looking at it makes me hungry again.
Wanting to try and finally got a chance to taste it. Love the taste.
Their slippery noodles is full of smokey aroma. The thick gravy is spiked with raw egg, minced meat, prawns and vegetables. --------------------------------------------------------\n<br />Visit www.misstamchiak.com or click link on bio to read more.
A $5 claypot Mee Tai Mak. Cooked with minced pork, chopped Kai lan, egg and a couple of shrimps. A nice dinner.
I succumbed to the temptation of my instagram and Burpple feed...\n<br />Sinful and rich, the bubbling pot of mee tai mak (silver needle noodles) is rather different from the usual stir-fried and soup version. The noodles were cooked well, slightly chewy but the highlight was of course the flavourful broth. How should you eat it? Mix in the egg with the thick savoury brown gravy then have it together with the cut vegetables and minced meat in every spoonful of noodles! It makes for a great comfort food any time!\n<br />Having to pick the ONE dish or meal that stood out this year is definitely no easy feat. 2015 has been a great year of feasting for me (especially having join Burpple) and to just pick one is nearly impossible but I can think of a dish that nicely summaries this year of over-eating. It is none other than 136 Hong Kong Street‚Äôs Claypot Mee Tai Mak! With the rising of hawkerhopping, there were some close fights but the dish wins hands down for its multiple appearances on my feed. Simple and comforting zi char is the way to go.\n<br />#bestfoodmemory2015
Slippery mouse-tail noodles with umami gravy, crunchy vegetables and that glorious egg too stir in to create that velvety texture around everything! \n<br />Definitely something good to tuck in before bed üòãüò¥
How much I have missed you making me go into food coma, more so during rainy days. There\'s just something magically about how you look and taste that makes everyone go \"ooh\" and \"aah\". From the mee tai mak, minced meat, chopped vegetables, runny egg to that umami black gravy, every ingredient in the dish hits the jackpot.
For that gooey sauce, slippery mee tai mak &amp; crunchy veges to put me into a food coma once again.\n<br />#ClaypotMeeTaiMak #136hongkongstreetfishheadsteamboat *
This Claypot Mee Tai Mak (M-$8) definitely surely needs no further introduction. Slippery mee tai mak noodles with savoury gravy, topped with vegetables to add that much needed crunch. Stirred in that egg and add a few pieces of chilli padi and in no time you will see that empty Claypot. 
Thereafter stir-fried with tangy sweet and sour sauce, accompanied by onion slices and capsicums. A common yet popular item you will see on the tables at cze char stall ‚Ä¢
This Claypot Mee Tai Mak may not be pretty, but it\'s darn tasty, and at only $8 for extreme comfort, it\'s everything you need after a long week. The plump little noodles lie in a sea of thick, bubbling, flavourful broth topped with a freshly-cracked egg. It is made complete with lovely bits of chopped vegetables, minced meat, and prawns. Be sure to ask for chilli padi to mix in! If you\'re coming in a large group, get a big portion to share, along with other dishes like Coffee/Salted Egg Pork Ribs and Boss Bee Hoon. As its name suggests, this place also does a mean, traditional Fish Head Steamboat ‚Äî the perfect dish to share with family on a cool night. Pro tip: simply reserve a table and pre-order dishes so you don\'t have to wait!
Their Marmite Chicken was a simple dish, featuring thin slivers of chicken stir-fried to a crisp, coated in a lovely savoury-sweet marmite glaze. While the pork dishes would beat this hands down any day, I wouldn\'t mind having this if I had the extra space.
so i swing the family from jurong to toa payoh for dinner yesterday. dad asked what is so special here upon seated. with a straight face i said, \"mee tai mak\". you should see his face. afternote: you know sunday dinner and its crowd, taste was a bit run down compare to the first time i had months ago. nevertheless, still slurping good with the gooey goodness
Their pork ribs are fried and cooked perfectly, surprisingly lean and really moist - so you won\'t go wrong ordering any of many pork ribs dishes. This however, stood out as THE best coffee pork ribs I\'ve had. Aside from the well-prepared pork, the sauce itself was mind-blowing. Sticky and caramelised, the coffee glaze was fragrant and really intense. I\'ve never had a rendition with that concentrated a coffee flavour, so coffee fans this is YOUR dish to try. The Salted Egg Pork Ribs may be most popular, but don\'t discount this too quick.
Quoting @vanessa_kou here that me too \"succumbed to the temptation of my Instagram and Burpple feed\". Mine didn\'t have that photogenic oozy wet yolk, but taste-wise it was spot on. Delicious, rich, and flavourful smokey broth as the base to our childhood mee tai mak (I love calling it mouse tail hehe!), finished with some minced meat, cut veggies and an egg. And the small serving\'s only S$5?! So. Cheap. 
and then dad asked again what else is good here. meekly, i said, \"pi dan\". the table shook a little. \n<br />p.s: a shot taken previously at burpple meet up. again, quality suffered because yesterday\'s weekend crowd. otherwise, the deep fry should render an enjoyable crisp to contrast the gelatinous outer and the creamy yolk. sweet sour sauce over the fried egg should be sharp and zesty too. lets hope is just this one time.
I succumbed to the temptation of my instagram and Burpple feed...
A must-try dish at 136 Hong Kong Street Fish Head Steamboat.
Oozing and bubbling with goodness, this Claypot Bee Tai Mak is a unique variation of the normal soup based ones in Singapore. The Bee Tai Mak was rich thick in consistency, and fragrant with its rich soya sauce base. Throwing in a fresh raw egg for the mix, it results in a sinfully delightful dish.
Can\'t get enough of salted egg yolk. üòÅ
2 x a week! Too much salted egg this week üòù
What salty dreams are made of. Goodnight!\n<br />‚ãÖ\n<br />#PorkRibs #CoffeeAndCravings *
Stumbled upon this one day, and what a delicious find it was. Super savoury and yummy, but make sure to eat while it is piping hot or it becomes rather gloppy.
Like the dry texture and the flavor wasn\'t too intense. I always prefer pork ribs served with meat and bones still intact. Get this the next time you\'re here!
5 munchies: These salted egg pork ribs were so crispy and yet not too thinly-sliced for a good bite! I loved how each slice of the meat was evenly coated with the savoury salted egg sauce. Curry leaves and chilli padi were also wok-fried to elevate the fragrance and give it some uplifting kick. This is one of the must-order dishes at 136 Hong Kong St, alongside the Claypot Mee Tai Mak and Marmite Chicken.
Claypot Mee Tai Mak was super awesome. The salted egg pork rib was disappointing though. 
Famous for their Claypot Mee Tai Mak. Just by its look, you will never understand how good it actually tasted. The savory pork based broth with a hint of lard, thicken with tapioca flour and finished with dark soy sauce. The joy of watching the raw egg been mixed into the Mee tai mak was simply unforgettable. Check out the link for the full experience. #hawkerpedia  http://www.jiaknonstop.com/hawker/tasty-zi-char-at-136-hong-kong-st\n<br />.\n<br />|\n<br />Side note: Recently, article on \"fake\" food reviews had been flooding and suffocating the f&amp;b industry. That\'s why I had always prefer @burpple (food app) which its content is generated by food lovers. Simply sharing the good eats with the public.
I am a fan of charcoal steamboat. It always give different taste to the soup, and the smell of the how the soup is being simmered will always bring some form of joy and excitement. There were plum and dried flat fish found in the soup base, among the usual suspect of yam, long cabbage and of course the garoupa fish pieces itself. And although I found the soup pleasant and delicious, it seemed to be ordinary. Delicious, but did not blow my mind. Maybe because it\'s the weekend, thus the chef may be overwhelmed by the crowd tonight. Good, but could have been better. 
Think claypot mee tai mak,  salted egg yolk pork ribs, sweet sour century eggs and three eggs spinach! YUMS! \n<br />Stay tuned for #burpple exciting #hawkerpedia #sg50 project, sharing local food stories, coming your way!
For a tiny island like Singapore, I\'m glad that our food culture is so chapalang &amp; that we\'re able to try out cuisines from all over! &amp; this leads to tourists remembering Singapore as the island that has really good food üòÅ Can\'t wait to share with you guys my Hawker stories &amp; favorites! üòã #Burpple
4.5 munchies: Super crispy nuggets of chicken wok-fried with curry leaves and onions, then coated with Marmite, maltose and honey. Though I wish I could munch on more of the meat instead of the sweet and salty batter, I could still snack on these with a pint of draught beer anytime of the day!
5 munchies: If it not were for the hawkerpedia eatup last night, I\'d never have ordered a mee tai mak (silver needle/rat noodles) dish myself given how much I dislike its plump and starchy texture since I was a kid. Besides the perfectly cooked noodles, the savoury gravy was packed with flavours, fresh prawns, minced meat, and vegetable cubes to give it that extra crunch. And oh, the raw egg would need to be stirred almost immediately when served to ensure it\'s cooked through while the claypot is piping hot!
So excited to be part of Burpple\'s SG50 digital book project, \"#Hawkerpedia: Singapore\'s Food Story\", with these other Tastemakers! It couldn\'t have been more appropriate to kick start the campaign with some awesome claypot mee tai mak, salted egg pork ribs, and finally, a 25-min walk to Creamier for waffles and ice cream!
Crunchy, delicious and addictive. I swear, there isn\'t any chicken pieces in this dish (or I\'m just unlucky)! LOL Just batter and marmite sauce creating that tasty crunch that I wished all cinema theatre have! Cause I don\'t mind all that unhealthy in my tummy! LOL. 
This dish is interesting. The century egg is coated in a light batter to fry and then tossed in the sweet and sour sauce. This give the dish a different dimension in taste and texture. It\'s nice to bite into the batter and into the soft jellied eggs. And the taste of the sweet and sour divert the \"pungent\" odour of the century egg, keeping the taste and smell lighter in contrast to having it just on its own. Interesting.  
I have been eating mee tai mak in fried version and I hate it, but this one is really super addictive. The seemingly thick gravy scared me at first but I found it surprisingly flavourful and soothing without being overwhelming. They are generous with the egg and ingredients as well. Perhaps, a new comfort food!
Look at the dark luscious gravy covering the noodles! I generally dislike mee tai mak because it tastes a lot like flour but this wok hei version really won me over. The vegetables helps alleviate the heaviness of the gravy after a while. I would imagine myself having intense craving for this sometime soon! This is the $8 version for 2 pax. Thanks burpple for this discovery!
Finally went to try this under burpple tastemaker @juliuslim recommendation. Mix in the raw egg and enjoy the mee tai mak with minced pork, prawn and cai por. Was delicious but if you go during dinner be prepared for a 30 mins wait. 
The Mongolian tofu was a very unique dish that came looking like a yam ring. It was like mashed up tofu that was fried and had a very tasty black pepper sauce with scallops and prawns. Highly recommended!
Super shiok, slippery mee tai mak with savoury sauce, crunchy cut long beans and a half boiled egg!
Was recommended this by @juliuslim and for that he deserves a candy bar as this was all kinds of glorious. There was the unmistakeable \"wok hei\" smokiness, cut vegetables in every spoonful which provided that crunch factor, and gravy so gooey, warm and comforting (especially when you add cut green and red chilli) that you would, at the end of the meal, mentally curl up in the fetal position and purr in content. 4/5
Was just talking to some #burppletastemakers last night about this Claypot Mee Tai Mak ($10 portion) and here I am today to enjoy it again. This is like a cauldron of goodness and raw eggs are added into the bubblin\' hot mixture before serving to create a thickening consistency. Stir it well and it\'s ready to feast.
We went to Toa Payoh today just to find this Claypot Mee Tai Mak ($10) that was originally located at Chinatown/Maxwell area but has since shifted to Toa Payoh Lorong 7, Block 19. Super flavorful, affordable and packed with lots of ingredients such as minced meat, prawns and diced vegetables. Stir and mix the raw egg before serving which adds an additional dimension to this fine dish.
Savoury and warm to the stomach at $5 while the other had beef tender hor fun, beef was really tender with matching gravy - $6. Homemade barley was good at $1.20.
The first 3 bites satisfy but the sauce was too one dimensional to sustain repeated eating. Nice big juicy prawns though. $20 for a medium portion.
Not much to look at but let not its appearance fool you. Crispy nuggets of succulent prawn slathered in a mild wasabi mayo make for addictive eating.
I love salted egg yolk anything so I might be slightly biased here, but these were exceptional. The salted yolk flavour was really punchy and every piece of crispy pork was coated evenly in the delicious sauce, unlike some versions elsewhere which can be a little dry. Curry leaves and a few slices of scattered red chilli provide a hint of heat and spice. $10 for a small portion
4 words - Claypot Mee Tai Mak. This dish may not be pretty, but it\'s darn tasty and only $5 for extreme comfort, complete with a raw egg for you to stir in. As its name suggests, this place is known for their Fish Head Steamboat, and other great dishes like Salted Egg Pork Ribs and Boss Bee Hoon. Best part is its convenient location next to Maxwell Market, and of course, air con!
One of the best in sg in my opinion. The soup is super good:)
Hidden gem on Chinatown/ Ann Siang Hill area. Apparently another secret delight off the menu.
Gave this a second try but still msg loaded as I\'m allergic to msg this has to go off from my list :/

Muahahaha üòÇ
This Saturday night was definitely an uplifting moment for me as I managed to reconcile with something that has eluded me for a while. Everything just seemed so right and back to normal once this cauldron of goodness was served. The wok hei, flavour and comfort level was just how it tasted like when I first had it a couple of years ago. Quoting from a fellow foodie, this claypot mee tai mak is definitely worth 5/5 munchies.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />136 Hong Kong Street Fish Head Steamboat\n<br />Address: 713, Clementi West Street 2, Singapore 120713 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock #claypotmeetaimak

The hot piping pot of mee tai mak is cooked in a savory black sauce that is instrumental in bringing the whole dish together. The addition of minced meat and diced kai lan provided the needed lift in textures. On top of that, the mee tai mak is brilliantly infused with the aromatic wok hei for an enjoyment experience. .\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #uncagestreetfood #tigerbeer #claypot #meetaimak #zichar
Super shiok after running up and down the court today.
Finally managed to give this place a try at TPY Lorong 7! \n<br />Full of wok hei goodness sauce coating along with the piping hot mee tai mak that can serves up to 3 pax for just 10 dollars, this is definitely super worth it! So amazingly good üòã
This $8 (M size portion) baby lives up to all its hype on social media. Nestled in a coffeeshop in the heartlands of Toa Payoh, 139 Hong Kong St delivers a pot full of local goodness that\'s jam packed with flavour. Not only is the mee tai mak chewy and tender, it\'s loaded with egg, minced pork, veggie and chye poh! The veg stems were added and diced up in small pieces for the extra crunch. As for the sauce... Oh my that glorious sauce! üò± We slurped up every drop of liquid gold.

Served bubbling hot, its colour was inviting and its taste didn\'t disappoint either. Served with minced pork, vegetables and some prawns, it was easy to eat and comforting especially on a cool evening. My only wish was that there would be more ingredient such as seafood or roast pork, perhaps with some option to top up in price.\n<br />Situated in the neighbourhood coffeeshop of TPY Lor 7, expect to see a full dinner crowd eating there though. Its fish head steamboat looked good too. #burpple #sgfood #foodporn #sgfoodies #singaporefood #foodphotography #foodstagram #exploresingapore #foodpics #sgfoodporn #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #supportlocalsg #tzecharsg #toapayohfood #jiaklocal

üòë anyway I think I dun regret gaining calories in these #saltedegg #porkribs is more like pork chop kind. The meat very yummy to eat. Similar taste to cereal prawns. Fish steamboat, snapper meats fresh, loved the yam inside. Mee Tai Ma is not bad too. #fishheadsteamboat #sgfood #burpple

It motivates me to explore for hidden/new food establishments, take better photos, write helpful reviews and fuel my passion to recommend more good eats to the community. \n<br />There\'s an exciting project coming up and I am very honored to be given the opportunity to be part of it. What better way to discuss on the project than to meet over food? It need not be at any top notch restaurant or fancy cafe, just a simple and humble dinner at a hawker centre/coffeeshop will suffice. We totally had a blast over dinner and even went for round 2 at Creamier even though it was a fairly long walk away from our original location. The project will be launched soon, so stay tuned for it!\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#onthetable #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #sghawker #coffeeshopping #hawkerpedia

Superb
Hot food for the flu.
Amazingly good. A satisfying dinner at a cheap price!
