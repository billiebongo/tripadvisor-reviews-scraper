One of the best sellers on Nook &amp; Cranny\'s menu would be their Chicken Bleu - boneless chicken thigh stuffed with bacon &amp; cheese and deep fried, served atop orzo and with a side of greens.
Nook &amp; Cranny\'s Nook Beef Sandwich ($14.50++) is basically the Portobello Beef Burger\'s smaller brethren, but it\'s no less heavenly than the burger. 
Because he\'s a fungi. Geddit?! Thank you, thank you, I\'ll be here all week. On a more serious note, Nook &amp; Cranny\'s Portobello Beef Burger is seriously excellent, and is definitely one of the better café burgers round town.

Want some home-made ice cream and a little more? The Brioche Toast (S$12.90) had proven to me that it is a dessert that deserves some special mention. The toasted bread is crispy on the outside but still a little fluffy on the inside. And it really worked for me when they coat their toast with cinnamon sugar, because I quickly associated this dessert with churros! Not to mention that their ferrero ice cream had a good balance of hazelnut, chocolate and traces of crunch.
Given that this is S$14.50, I think they do give a relatively good portion of macaroni in the bowl. What is different from most other Mac &amp; Cheese is that they use mozzarella and cheddar, and most of them gather at the top to give it a more solid crust. The sous vide egg on top would of course add some aesthetic value to make the dish Instagram-able.
PRICE: Earl grey float $8.00 + GST
This Chicken Bleu ($15.50) is delicious! The chicken is so tender and juicy, and it is marinated nicely. The good food and white decor makes this place a perfect hideout on a weekday afternoon.
Foamy and fragrant, Nook &amp; Cranny\'s Japanese Green Tea Latte ($6) was not overly sweet and had a nice balance of bitterness. Perfect with some light pastries to go together!
Nook &amp; Cranny\'s version of a Chicken Corden Bleu, which comes served with salad and Orzo pasta. It\'s decently done, but there are lots of room for improvement especially for the chicken. Not sure if they intended for the dish to be on their own take, but I wasn\'t particularly much a fan of the melted cheese that barely covered the bacon-wrapped chicken rather than being rolled within. The chicken breast was also rather dry and tough, though I did enjoy the Orzo grains which were particularly garlicky on certain bits — could have been better if the flavour was more consistent through however.
After dinner along Upper Thomson Road, walk over to this white-themed cafe in Thomson V One to continue your conversation. Open till midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and till 11pm on other days, Nook &amp; Cranny (previously named Five by Five) dishes out waffles, ice cream and drinks to please your sweet tooth. Order the Waffle ($6) — it is crisp on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside, and rather interestingly, tastes like McD\'s pancakes. Pair it with a scoop (or two) of ice cream — top flavours include the refreshing but rich Coconut Taro ($4.80), Thai Milk Tea ($4.20) and Salted Caramel ($4.80). Wash it all down with a cup of iced Matcha Latte ($7.50) that comes with azuki red beans.\n<br />Avg price: $10 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Nobelle Liew
This place was used to be called Five by Five but its being taken over by Nook &amp; Canny! Mac &amp; Cheese was a 👎🏻👎🏻 ($14.50) but the Chicken Bleu ($15.50) was really good &amp; the serving was rather generous! Their Sweet Potato Fries was 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 ($8.50)
Kinda pricey, but it\'s one of the best matcha lattes in Singapore with its intense matcha flavor and subtle sweetness. Also, it comes with a scoop of matcha ice cream inside. Overall a well-balanced drink that matcha lovers should try!! 
My favorite matcha latte!! In my opinion, it\'s the most balanced and I love that it\'s not cloyingly sweet so that the matcha flavor isn\'t overwhelmed. 
The last time I came their waffle is crispy outside, moist and fluffy inside but this time is 😞 If only the waffle is consistent
The best matcha latte in Singapore. Unsweetened and appropriately bitter, served in a wooden cup. Nothing like those artificially sweetened stuff served in other places I\'ve tried. 
Love the scrambled egg and toast!\n<br />Side note: the waiting time for the food is really longgggg..don\'t go if you r real hungry!
A good place to chill and read. Like the bright, wooden hues of this place and the friendly staff. Got the flat white and choc mint ice cream. I was expecting choc with mint ice cream, instead of mint with choc ice cream. Nevertheless enjoyed my afternoon here! 
Liking the vibe here on a lazy Wed afternoon and enjoying what\'s left of my annual leave :)
Waffle was great - crisp outside, moist and fluffy inside. You know it is good when you don\'t feel a need for any sauce! It is on the sweeter side, which I actually liked. However, the same cannot be said of the ice cream. The texture is super thick, what I like to describe as plasticine ice cream. The coconut resembles the packet coconut milk you can get from NTUC, with loads of sugar and a tinge of yam extract. Very unimpressed. Just get 1 scoop if you must; 3 scoops of ice cream with waffles will cost an exorbitant $18++.
The Chicken Bleu was slightly undercooked, I still prefer the one at Amoy street which I will go someday and take picture of it! The MAC and Cheese was good but it was a bit salty. 
Matcha latte was awesome! One of the best! The cold matcha latte was slightly sweeter and it has red beans:) those who like sweeter drink, you will prefer the cold one! As you can adjust how much green tea you want to pour inside your drink:)
{Green Tea Latte}\n<br />.\n<br />May your Sunday be a good one friends!! 💪
Best matcha I\'ve had in Singapore. None of that artificially sweetened nonsense. 
 Salmon Florentine - this dish consists of 2 poached eggs with honey ham and bacon, smoked salmon and baby spinach, served on English muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce.
Enjoyed scoops of Golden Vanilla and Thai Milk Tea ($4.20 per scoop) ice-cream atop one of the nicest waffles ($6) I\'ve had. Just the right amount of crisp and flavour for me! Golden Vanilla had great flavour and texture while the Thai Milk Tea was a little \'icy\' (not as creamy/you know what I mean). Definitely worth a try! The place has really nice ambience and my friend very much enjoyed the coffee served.
Matcha concentrate with a cup of ice cold milk and a scoop of matcha ice cream. Matcha lovers, you may start screaming now. \n<br />#Burpple #fivebyfivesg #aroundwithamd
The beef patty was juicy and well-seasoned, topped with an entire grilled portobello cap, bacon, ham, melted cheese and egg. All of that was held together by two fluffy and nicely toasted sesame buns. A simple and delicious burger, this was not a game changer, rather a simple burger done much better than expected. Our only gripe was the BBQ sauce they were a tad heavy-handed with. 
First time there on a sunny and hot Saturday afternoon for lunch. Ordered a coffee and their beef burger. Both were decent. Good food for a Saturday and nothing much to rave about. Decided next to have their waffle and ice cream, and wow. That coconut taro was amazing and simply refreshing. Their waffles and ice cream are priced separately, so it\'s not exactly cheap, but worth every cent. 
As not insta worthy and overcooked as it looks,  it actly turned out crispy outside and airy light inside.👍 The coconut taro and thai milk tea ice cream may look ordinary but they were actually pretty rich and good. 😁😉 Some way cld probably be found to bring out the buttermilk fragrance even more  and improve the appearance(?) of the waffle! 😉
Classic Waffle with Bubblegum and Coconut Taro ($15) - waffle and ice cream are charged separately, not cheap. \n<br />Waffle was decent but lack of crisp on the outside, though I could feel the fluffiness on the inside. The taste of the batter was rather strong, so it kind of felt ‘uncooked’ to the right temperature/time. \n<br />This is when I DIY and added popcorns (complimentary starter) to enhance the visual and taste.
🌞 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day - have you had yours yet? (:
Went there when it just opened, nice place to chill because there\'s both outdoor and indoor dinning. What\'s cool is that there\'s also an ice cream bar where you can pick your ice cream after you finish your dinner. Typical brunch set taste sweeter than ever! 👍🏻👍🏻 (partly thanks to the big juicy cherry tomatoes😋) 
Let\'s hope it\'s gonna be a good week ahead.
😋😄 #TGIF
The roasted pork also not as tough as I would expect.
It may be a little insane to consume that much sugar in one seating (staff gave me the \"really, 3 scoops?\" kinda look), but it\'s unavoidable when faced with that many choices and a delish waffle. (Ok I actually had 5 scoops and 2 waffles, but that\'s a story for another time.) My absolute faves were the Salted Caramel &amp; Coconut Taro, with their Thai Milk Tea &amp; Matcha Azuki coming in as close seconds. 
In frame: waffles with matcha azuki ice cream and coconut taro ice cream. I think they are using the same old waffles batter recipe as November 8 but somehow it is not as crispy and fragrant as I remember it to be. Nevertheless, it is one good dinning experience. \n<br />P.S: ice cream is a bit icy. But the flavour is there and serving is generous
One of the better matcha lattes I have tried. \n<br />_\n<br />Going for a leisurely swim in a long time. Screw the haze.\n<br />_\n<br />#thefoodjournalist \n<br />_
It sounded really good on paper: Slow Roasted Pork Belly with Japanese Miso Seasoning, served with Orzo Rice Pasta and Greens. Presentation was sloppy, slab of pork belly definitely not slow-cooked (had trouble running my knife through it, fat wasn\'t even rendered properly), orzo was mush. I\'d be sticking to my coffee and waffles if I\'m here!
Decent waffle with nice crisp edges and icecream flavours were good despite the slight iciness. \n<br />Flavours of icecreams we ordered: Thai Milk Tea, Choco Mint Paradise and Salted Caramel(with chopped almonds). Didn\'t care much for the salted caramel icecream cause it lacked both flavour and salt, but I\'d order the other two flavours if I drop by again. \n<br />Usually brightly lit, but they turn down the lights once it hits 630pm in the evening, so if you\'re looking to take \"Instagram worthy\" photos, do drop in before evening comes. 
Fresh citrus, refreshing, with fruit pulp (pomelos), bobas and all. Though I\'m super big on coffee (theirs by the guys of Common Man Coffee Roasters), this is a wonderful beverage alternative and a great thirst quencher! 
The folks behind the now-defunct November 8 in Thomson V have opened Five by Five, taking over a new space that now faces the main road. The clean white walls, wood furnishings and oodles of natural light should prove popular amongst cafe-hoppers and the Instagram community. Coffee blends here are from the ever-reliable Common Man Coffee Roasters, while ice cream flavours include Thai Milk Tea, Bubblegum and Matcha Azuki. Go for their signature waffles ($6, or $10.20 with a single scoop of ice cream) and add a scoop of their refreshingly yam-my Coconut Taro ice cream! Beer from taps are also available here, if you are looking for a spot to drink at night.
I ordered waffle with thai milk tea and coconut taro ice cream. My favorite is the coconut taro which was rich, creamy and able to detect the yam taste. Thai milk tea was a little too sweet and a little icy as well. I guess they have changed the waffle recipe, it\'s taste and texture are better now.
White tiles, white tables, flat white. Weekend had just begun!
Beautiful cafe with a very IG friendly space (white and bright).😁👌🏻 Still in a soft launch so no menu, paying is base on tipping. We like the taro &amp; coconut ice cream, but the matcha and salted caramel were too icy for us. Waffles came a bit undercooked too. :/ But at least the people were really nice and friendly. ☺️👌🏻
The white space, marble tables, wooden chairs, will be the next big hit for instagrammers!
Fans of November 8 would probably find the waffles from Five by Five pretty familiar; the waffles here had not changed much. Fragrant with a slight Pandan-like flavour that is pretty reminiscent of the neighbourhood bakery waffle, the only problem seemed to be how the waffle was a tad doughy due to uneven heat distribution which led to the left side a tad undercooked in comparison to the right; perhaps the waffle machine needs time to get seasoned. We went for the Coconut Taro, Matcha and Thai Milk Tea flavours; the Matcha felt a tad grainy while the Coconut Taro was subtle with yam flavours yet refreshing from the coconut, and was significantly smoother in texture amongst the three.

The texture of the waffle and the taste are not that great. However, the maple syrup and chocolate ice cream is so good! 
CNY gathering with the AJCO 96 folks.
Sadly, the waffle was quite disappointing. Felt that the batter was too bland and Gao which made it hard to finish the waffle on my plate. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgeats #foodsg #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #exsgcafes #instafood #instafoodie #instafoodsg #openricesg #burpple #setheats #8dayseat #sgdessert #dessertsg #SingaporeInsider #matcha #waffles #latte #latteart #matchalatte

Mostly are standard flavours. Ordered the mint, durian &amp; rocher with #waffle \n<br />The ice cream tasted more like #gelato than the normal cream #icecream Although flavourful but the taste doesn\'t linger in the mouth.

Dropped in during the soft launch period. Not much food items were available but can see the potential. One thing to note....they got some of the more comfortable chairs at a cafe. Lol! \n<br />The #mocha is good! Doesn\'t taste diluted and the chocolate they use are the dark type. Not too milky too. Nice! \n<br />#cafe #cafeculture #cafehopping #cafehoppingsg #cafelife#cafesg #caffeine #coffee #coffeegram #coffeeholic#coffeelife #coffeelove #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram#sgcafe #sgfood #sgfoodies #singapore #sgcafefood#instafood_sg #burpple #eatoutsg #podcult #fivebyfive #fivebyfivesg
Cause that\'s what Mary Poppins said to use when something\'s that fantastic you\'re lost for words. Not everyone would agree with me, but I found Five by Five\'s waffles maddeningly addictive. Super buttery, eggy, and moist, these are like the waffles you get at HDB bakeries - but way crispier. So think of it as a cross between local and western dessert waffles. It\'s probably not THE best waffles, but by far one of the most texturally interesting ones with great flavours. 
Waited more than 20 minutes yesterday as they did not prepare much for the day while today is a off day for them.
Do you know that female Pikachus have heart-shaped tails?
They should rename the shop November 6 instead 😏 heh!
