It is inadvisable to come here on any day other than Friday, and that\'s cos you\'re gonna need some time on Saturday to work off what you ate the night before. Juuust kidding! No scared. This oh-so-freaking-juicy fried chicken is worth Every. Single. Calorie. Grab anyone who doesn\'t mind watching (or joining) you stuff your face with beautifully crisp chicken skin, and breast meat so tender you won\'t believe it. Always, always ask for extra gravy to dunk that skin and all those fries in. Don\'t complicate matters by ordering the two-piece meal or any other combo, just go ahead and get at LEAST the Half Spring Chicken Meal ($7.10) for yourself. If you\'re a big eater, one whole spring chicken ($11.90) will be just right, seriously. Don\'t you dare get utensils for this. Pro tip: order takeaway and wait half the time, sit at the hawker centre nearby!
Went on a weekday night and it was a 20 minute wait for a table - can\'t imagine how long it will be over the weekends! #burpple #arnoldschicken
Served pipping hot, Arnold\'s signature Spring Chicken is really fragrant and fried to a golden brown perfection! The meat was succulent and I could detect some seasoning used on the crisp exterior making the skin really addictive.
WHY IS IT SO GOOD?!?! I know my picture doesn\'t do it justice of that innocent looking demure fried chicken over there but people who tried it would understand me well. \n<br />Had the Half Spring Chicken (Ala-carte $7.10) to share and instantly regret it after the first bite! (Why I never order the WHOLE one 😢) Usually, I\'m not the fried food + No Chicken Skin person. But no matter how my brain says NO,  my hands and mouth couldn\'t stop eating that super flavourful lightly crisp skin. The meat was another \"Wow\" at how juicy and tender it was! \n<br />After our meal, we both understood the craziness of the queue and agreed that this was way finger licking good than the other places 😆
Arnold\'s has been around for more than 30 years, and for good reason. Just look at that perfectly fried chicken! Pro tip: order takeaway to escape the hour-long wait and sit at the nearby hawker. Also ask for extra gravy to dip the skin in. Really. 
If you have not tried the 1/2 Spring Chicken Meal ($7.10) from Arnold\'s Fried Chicken before, you are missing out big time. Juicy and succulent chicken that\'s so well marinated that the aroma will hit you upon entering the restaurant.
Essentially a one-way ticket to Facial Liu Sha Bao Station on the Fatsville Line but dang, it was an epic and memorable journey. The crispy and phenomenally tasty skin was the obvious star of the show, like KFC chicken skin undergone a flavour mega evolution. Initially I thought that past the skin it would be an exercise in tasteless chicken meat consumption, but then the tender flesh revealed its peppery charms. I swear I discovered parts of a chicken I never knew existed scarfing down this bad boy like a starving vagabond. Be warned - this chicken makes you revert to primal state and will make you feel very, very dirty - and you will love it. 4/5 
Fried till golden brown and only uses farm fresh chicken, Arnold\'s Chicken is the go-to place for fried chicken. Forget about KFC or \"KFC\" (Korean fried chicken), this is the real deal. The two piece meal ($6.60) comes with 2 chicken parts, fries and coleslaw. 
The queue to dine in is insane, so here\'s a tip: order a whole chicken takeaway (with extra gravy) and cross the road to the hawker centre, unbox your chicken order yourself an ice cold beer. This is easily one of the best fried chickens I\'ve had; skin so crisp and breasts so tender. Peel off some skin and dunk it into that gravy...
Chicken skin is thin yet tender and crispy.  Dipping it in the potato gravy sauce makes it heavenly!
Easily one of the best fried chicken outlets in Singapore. Not many come close to this.
Finally I\'m here to try Arnold\'s fried chicken, specially marinated and deep fried till golden brown. They are really 👍
Best fried chicken in town! Be sure to order the spring chicken with gravy, it\'s the most value for money! :) 
Arnold\'s Chicken - Haven\'t had this since primary school.  Liked the batter.  But Jollibee is probably better overall.
Amazing fried chicken hidden away in an unsuspecting mall. Crispy, tasty and juicy while not too oily. The regulars agree, too - there was a 30 minute queue but it was worth it!
