This is true latte art, visual satisfaction from start till end of goodness 👍🏻👍🏻
I WISH LA 😂 Anyways, wishing all a great week ahead 😊💕▪\n<br />Their coffee was pretty good😍 the taste profile was to my liking!  You can smell the aroma of the coffee right when you step into the cafe. Definitely wouldn\'t mind immersing in that while doing some work / reading.
Made a trip down East for they seem to be selling iced coffee in a bottle. The iced coffee here is more milkier at the start, though there is still a lingering taste of smooth coffee towards the end.
Was pretty close to getting this during the previous visit but I thought I should exercise some self-discipline and control so as to not stuff myself silly so near lunch. I liked how this came together — sure, I wouldn\'t mind more Kaya inside but I certainly enjoyed how everything came together here to replicate a good Kaya toast; that buttery, flaky croissant with coconut shavings atop was something I really liked. Pair it with a Long Black, or if that is too mild to replicate Kopi O you could go for a double shot of Espresso Macchiato here for that \"local breakfast\" vibe.
Being the Kueh Ambon junkie I am, I definitely had to head down to Percolate when I found out that they are serving up a Honeycomb Cake in their cafe. Pretty decent to go with a cup of long black — while it is a wee bit drier than I had expected, it\'s lightly sweet and had those satisfying streaks that\'s essential for a good Kueh Ambon. Breakfast, settled!
It\'s Wednesday already! Looking forward to weekend liao 😁 But before it comes, a Kaya butter croissant first 😋 Ho jiak! The best route to this cafe is to take public transport, MRT, to the nearest Bedok station.\n<br />-\n<br />🇸🇬\n<br />-\n<br />📍Percolate\n<br />Blk 136 Bedok North Ave 3\n<br />Unit 01-152 Singapore 460136\n<br />Tel: 8259 0316\n<br />Wed to Fri 10.30am - 9.30pm\n<br />Sat/Sun 9am - 9.30pm
Can\'t believe I took so long to try out the Banana Date Loaf ($8) from @percolatecoffee! \n<br />That moist dense banana Date cake slathered with @the_hunters_kitchenette\'s almond nut butter with some accompanying berries and mascarpone cheese. Every element was well thought through and worked together super well! \n<br />While you are there, don\'t forgot to order their Curry Egg Mayo Croissant ($7) for yummy crispy buttery croissant!
Banana Loaf ($8)
As an eastie, Percolate has always been on my wishlist and I can finally tick it off! ✅
One of the more recent additions to the menu here at Percolate which sees a revision with some items such as the Coffee Caviar Shooters taken out of the menu with additions such as a Sausage &amp; Saukerkaut Croissant. This sounds quirky but works as a comforting and light lunch option; the same Ciabatta from their Tom Yum Chicken Ciabatta sandwich but with a mildly spicy salsa with tomatoes and pickles, a slab of Otah, lettuce and a slice of cheese in between. As quirky was it initially sounds, the salsa quite worked with the Otah by adding a tangy hint of flavours alongside with the reasonably spicy, chunky slab of Otah with chunks of fish within. Comes accompanied with a side of cassava chips.
The Banana Date Loaf ($8), served with mascarpone and Hunters\' Kitchenette almond nut butter, was moist, fragrant, and so satisfying. Comfort factor upped with a cup of Coconut Latte, delicate and not overwhelming 😌 #percolatecoffee #burpple
Take a break at Percolate with a cup of green tea latte. Or try their coco latte where the coconut oil is added. They use papa pahelta coffee beans and nylon coffee roasters.
Wish cafes like this were present when I was still schooling in this area. The beans they use are from papa pahelta and nylon  coffee roasters. The flat white that I had didn\'t have a very complex flavour but it was well-balanced and had a slight hint of nutty flavour. I like the cafe\'s use of natural light as well. 
After a light dinner, this completes the evening without any effort. Super smooth hot coconut chocolate is really the pull factor. The tea cake is subject to availability.
While seeking refuge from the rain, the fragrant scent of coconut that downplays the richness of the chocolate, loved this smooth cup of coconut-infused hot chocolate! 
Milk is steamed with a shot of coconut oil.. And i have to say this is one of the best versions i\'ve had. The scent of coconut really lifts every sip, and despite the slightly greasier film on the lips and palette, i really enjoy the smoothness and richness.
Loved this!! The loaf is very moist yet not too dense, served with mascarpone, crushed almond, honey and almond nut butter for that extra nutty fragrance and sweetness, balanced with the slight sourness of berries. Wasn\'t sure if I could finish it by myself as the nut butter might be a little too rich, but I did and it\'s a really good tea time snack! 😌
Extra smooth coconut inspired beverage. Must slowly enjoy this luxury hot stuff. Wonderful creation.
House specials, dark chocolate, vanilla ice cream and espresso. Always different variations of cakes due to availability. Hidden gem. Very popular during weekends. 
A smooth, luxurious treat that comes all chocolatey and a little nutty for its a flourless cake with a nut base instead. This decadent treat definitely worked well with my usual order of the Espresso Tonic; a rather heavy beverage where they inject a shot of espresso into tonic water which is a great respite from the unforgiving heat these days
this turned out to be way better than expected! generous serving of pretty well seasoned tomyum sauce that went perfectly with the tender chicken :-) ciabatta was crispy and light!! really worth the 10$! also the sauerkraut looks so cute HAHA the 5.50$ dirty chai is worth a try! for someone who loves chai but never orders it bc it\'s always done overly sweet here, u can really trust me when I say a chai latte is good ;-)
Is it because it\'s been a while since i\'ve had coffee made from espresso and frothed milk (as opposed to a sachet)? I think not.. Percolate never fails. Today\'s Four Chairs blend was a winner - rich, fuller-bodied, nutty complexity - but the guest espresso blend was pretty good too. Also, what symmetrical wing-tulip-hearts?!!
Situated under a block of flats in Bedok North, this rustic, homey cafe is the perfect place for an intimate catch up with a friend or two. Having taken over the adjacent store, it now has more seating space, so if you haven\'t popped by Percolate in a while, it\'s a good reason to revisit! The menu has been updated as well, with additions like the much raved Coffee Caviar Shooters ($4.50) — a coffee-centric dessert that includes cream, velvety smooth custard and little coffee-infused orbs that burst in your mouth. But first, to fill growling stomachs, order the Curry Egg Mayo Croissant ($7) — a buttery soft croissant stuffed with creamy eggy sauce, and the crowd favourite Tom Yum Grilled Chicken on Ciabatta ($10) — grilled chicken slathered with a spicy yet tangy sauce, served with a side of chips. Don\'t leave without getting a coffee — everything\'s good, especially the Espresso Tonic ($5.50), double shots of espresso with tonic water and lime!
a classic flat white. theres just this unpretentious charm at percolate. they just want to genuinely serve you coffee you know? even the more fanciful coffee items here are not over-the-top theatrics. just love the humble homey vibe at percolate
Love their cakes, if only we will have more variety of it
However once the vanilla ice cream has settled in and all the elements such as gula melaka and coconut shavings are stirred together, this Gula Melaka Affogato ($6) resulted in a nice and refreshing dessert.
Despite the increase in floor space, the whole homely atmosphere of @Percolate didn\'t differ much. Friendly service and hearty meal paired with good coffee. This Tom Yam Grilled Chicken on Ciabatta, flavourful and filling will only set you back by $10! Grab a 5oz white ($4.50) to go with it or the Coffee Cavier Shooter ($4.50) if you want a perk me up and a dessert in the same sitting.
me please! What\'s for your breakfast? 🍴\n<br />Have a great Tuesday y\'all!\n<br />#percolatesg
One of my frequent places to visit! Friendly staffs and cozy environment. I am glad to have them in the east. They have lovely desserts too that changes from time to time.
.\n<br />☕️ Flat white for 👦🏻 .\n<br />🍰  Cake for 👩🏻 .\n<br />Love the chocolate peanut butter cake too! A bit too rich, so good for sharing. 😊
Nah. Just a simple Carrot loaf with cream cheese and my 2nd glass of iced Mocha.
So here I am again. Twice in a week and 3 times this month!
Finally tried something different from @percolatecoffee .Their coconut latte is simply divine. Just imagine, warm and luscious coconut milk, infused with a shot of their delectable espresso. A combination surely to warm not only your hearts but your soul. Try it today. Just enjoying Life\'s simple pleasures. 
Time for weekend coffee!\n<br />#PercolateSG #MorningCoffee *
But you feel like you\'re doing something. That is what coffee is. And that is one of the geniuses of the new coffee culture.\n<br />- Jerry Seinfeld
Great coffee, Friendly staff. What more can you ask from a cafe. Coffee is always good and they have a nice range to choose from. From the ordinary Americano, mocha, to a flat white to a latte. And they even have drinks for the peeps that don\'t take caffeine. They have sodas and coolers. 
Nothing spells Christmas more than eggnog, and Percolate is serving both the Classic Eggnog and an Eggnog Latte this year. A warm, milky and creamy concoction that is lightly sweet with a little egginess sprinkled with cinnamon powder, there is nothing quite as comforting for the rainy season like this counting down to Christmas.
Ordered a 5oz white ($4.5) and banana date loaf (just the loaf so it was $3.5)• service was great, extremely cheery and helpful:))• was craving some banana bread, and this satisfied that craving. Not too moist and was nice and warm too:)
yesterday\'s brunch situation when the far west dwellers decided to travel to far east. banana date loaf with berries, honey, dollop of mascarpone and almond butter from hunters kitchenette (cheers to local produce man!). ideally to share because while the quality spread is uber rich, it was a tad heavy to continue after a few mouths, saved by the much needed mascapone to wet down things a little. that said, loaf was exceptionally homey fragrant.
fun fact: 65% coffee consumption happens during breakfast hour. i belong.
i like my carrot cake moist and wet like this. period.
A combination of all the best things in the world for $7. Overall I enjoyed this - cake was moist, and not sweet. Didn\'t quite taste the peanut butter though. 
Come back for the second visit! Love the ambience when it is not so crowded and of coz, can\'t resist the espresso tonic here! Tried the smoked salmon wasabi mayo croissant ($9) - just nice for my light dinner. 
Fluffy, sweet and has that rustic, homemade feel to it. With all the commercialisation and mass production going on, i now have a greater appreciation for such things.
This is a hidden treasure in bedok north neighborhood area!! Okay, the menu isn\'t that fancy like the other cafés and there were few people came in and out without having anything. But for coffee addict like me, this place serves very good coffee. The photo shown is the espresso tonic ($5.5) which is the double shots of espresso with tonic water and lime! The earl grey bundt cake ($3.5) is just alright, I don\'t want to say it\'s not nice because this place is so cozy and chill that I love it much and don\'t want to leave any negative comment! Hahaa! Btw, I ordered the $6 filtered coffee too. 
Throwback a [Banana Date Loaf S$8] - served with mascarpone, berries, crushed almond &amp; almond nut butter. The almond nut butter is not sweet, perfect for old people like us 😂😂 overall 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Had their house special \"Bittersweet\" - a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped on a piece of dark chocolate brownie, with a shot of expresso pour over it. Love how this pair work together beautifully with the vanilla ice cream melted slowly over the brownie, and with just a touch of espresso that complement the rich, deep chocolate flavor of the brownies. Heavenly combo!
It\'s finally Friday~~~~ First time here after the revamp, love the new space! [Mocha S$5]
The croissant was fragrant and very yummy, and was amazing paired with GSH\'s jams (we tried the mango &amp; lime). It\'d be perfect if it were a tad aerated and toasted. Enjoyed with a fruitty 5oz White, it makes a wonderful midweek pick-me-up.
Probably the last new concoction that I hadn\'t tried at the revamped Percolate. The closest thing to the Nitro Black Matter at Chye Seng Huat, this combines Long Black together with a fizzy body which makes it a good caffeinated thirst quencher on a hot day. 
This was fluffier, spongier and more well-balanced than it looks - that amount of cream cheese frosting tho. Perfect to go with an iced coffee on a hot day.
We shared the cake amongst ourselves, and we separately ordered drinks for ourselves. i ordered the salted caramel affogato which was really good, but i felt that more caramel could be used (3/5) while my friend ordered the iced chocolate which was a bit diluted but it tasted fine anyway. (2/5) we ordered the flourless chocolate cake which tasted a bit bland, did not feel rich enough but it was good overall without being really sweet. (3/5) the red velvet cake was moist, accurate ratio of cream cheese frosting and the cake made it taste nice. the toppings ( i believe it was hundreds and thousands-ish) was a bit unnecessary though. (4/5) 
Spent my evening at this humble little cafe located in the heartlands of Bedok. Had their Smoked Salmon Wasabi Cream Cheese Croissant and I have to say I really love it! The smoked salmon was savory which paired really well with the wasabi cream cheese leaving a slight tingly feel on my tongue after every bite. As for the Iced Mocha, it is one of the best that I\'ve ever had! It wasn\'t too bitter and had a slight nutty flavor which was to my liking. Can\'t wait to be back to indulge in the rest of their desserts! ☺️
Coffee time after lunch. Happy midweek. Love their banana date loaf that is not overly sweet.
If you haven\'t check out percolate after their revamp, you should!
Banana 🍌🍌date loaf surrounded with 🍓🍓strawberries &amp; blueberries with a little dollop of mascarpone &amp; sprinkled with almond bits for crunchy texture. Served warm....adored the banana aftertaste and it was not a sweet sweet loaf😄😄#bananas #bananaloaf #loaves #dessertlovers #whati8today #burpple #openricesg @percolatecoffee
Creamy, not too sweet, great punch of caffeine, with the right amount of caramel coating your palate. Served with crunchy almond chunks and an old school dessert spoon, no less!\n<br />These guys from @percolatecoffee sure are meticulous about all aspects of their products. \n<br />Appreciated! 🙌🏻
Another one of the new items that is launched in the menu of the revamped Percolate. A shot of espresso within tonic water that is spiked with a slice of lime, think of it as an espresso-based mocktail which bears the taste similar to Sprite and Espresso mixed as one. A pretty unique concoction. 
If you are not up yet, wake up and smell the fresh air of no-work Mondays. In the process, get a cup of Coffee Caviar Shooters ($4.50) to go along with it. I was pleasantly surprised by this as it was coffee mousse with some whipped cream on top. In it are those miniature cute coffee caviar that added a surprise element to the drink. How awesome it would be if those balls are able to burst out coffee liquid.
Great for a hot day - anyone also hot and bothered here? Don\'t expect to share this treat of espresso, cream and coffee pearls though because it comes in a double shot glass that only leaves you wanting more.
It\'s a cafe tucked somewhere in Bedok with a very friendly and cozy vibe. I would really want to come back to try their cakes. It\'s a pretty quiet place in the morning. Good to catch up over a good book and a yummy cup of coffee.
Slow things down and take on different perspectives for things, you might find something better! \n<br />House special Coffee Cavier Shooters($4.50) - more of a dessert than a coffee drink, it\'s like a remix of your tiramisu ejected into a shot, I could very well lick this clean! Wish the cavier could really burst out coffee but what more could you ask for for $4.50.
Glad to see neighbourhood cafes such as these inject new blood into our HDB estates. Thank you Avin for staying true to your vision, and congrats on your successful expansion
Hopefully it was something like this buttery fragrant Curry Egg Mayo Croissant($7), flaky and soft to the bite with creamy curry egg mayo filling. \n<br />Haven\'t been to Percolate for awhile and decided to pop by since they revamped and expanded their place. As they took over their neighbour shop, the space is much bigger yet it doesn\'t lose their previous cosy feeling👍 love the rustic woody vibes here!
Percolate recently opened its doors after closing for renovations and one of my favourite items in the menu has got to be the Curry Egg Mayo Croissant ($7). Such an innovative idea to have curry spices in egg mayo, and the best part to pair with a warm buttery croissant. The newly revamped Percolate 2.0 is much bigger with a slightly different decor. Menu has also been upsized to include more items, so do pay them a visit soon!
Have a lovely afternoon with a Tom Yum Grilled Chicken on Ciabatta ($10) and let\'s countdown to the upcoming extended weekends! Also, today is Eat With Your Family Day, which means early knock-off from work today! 
Thinking of the croissant and coffee at my fav neighborhood cafe
A platter designed for the real coffee enthusiast. Coming with a shot of Espresso and then a 5 Oz White with a shot of sparkling water at the side, you can choose between the Nylon Coffee Roasters blend or the Papa Pahelta blend offered here. The trick is to have a shot of the espresso to taste the full flavours of the blend, then wash your tastebuds with the sparkling water to enjoy the 5 Oz White to get an inkling of how the blend would taste like in a Flat White where milk is involved.
This tasted so good when chilled especially in this hot weather!Love how smooth and light the custard is..and that burst of slightly bitter coffee caviar!Now I just wish that this is nearer to me.. 😭😭 #EileenWantsToCampHereForever #Percolate #Coffee #Caviar #burpple

.\n<br />|\n<br />We visited them the day before their renovation. Nice, buttery croissant with tasty filling (curry chicken, egg mayo and smoked salmon with wasabi mayo). Not a bad eat but their coffee is better.
House Special Mousse with Coffee Infused Caviar, an interesting coffee dessert newly introduced at Percolate 2.0.
@Percolatecoffee opens its doors yesterday after taking a break :) ! It\'s now bigger and I\'m loving the new look :) ------////////----------Help yourselves to the new items on the menu { banana date loaf } and wash it down with either the { sparkling black } an ice coffee made with sparking water ( got a little too bitter when I got to the last 20% of it ) or have a cup of { dirty chai } if ur not a coffee fan . End it all with a sea salt caramel affogato! -------//////---------\n<br />I can\'t call myself a regular here ..in fact I\'m never a regular at any cafes but been here many times given the close proximity to where I stay . Say hi if u see me there next time lol !!
One of the few brand new desserts available at the revamped Percolate 2.0. Comes with cream, custard and coffee-flavoured caviar, this interesting dessert was surprisingly a balance of light, airy creaminess atop thick, creamy custard and coffee caviar which comes with just the right intensity of caffeine flavours. Really worth the go!
Love how Percolate likes inducing local favourite flavours into their savoury dishes. Ciabatta was light and crisp, while the Tom Yam Chicken did definitely deliver the slightly sour yet spicy kick that is promised. Comes with a slice of cheese and greens, with chips on the side.
Not a fan of croissant dishes but this one fits so well for me. Croissant was crisp and fluffy, while encasing greens, fresh smoked salmon with cream cheese spiked with wasabi. While the smoked salmon was savoury, it really went very well with the cream cheese which was pretty luscious and spiked with wasabi so as to tingle the tastebuds with a bit of numbness. Guess this is one of the few dishes I would find hard to forget and would crave for in the future.
The boys are finally back today in action percolating after a month long hiatus of revamping their space and menu.
- Hebrews 12:2. \n<br />It is just beyond human comprehension how Jesus endured the gruesome death on the cross, because of the joy set before Him. He rejoiced that the Cross is where the justice/wrath and love of God meets, and that through His death, man and God can be reconciled. Blessed Good Friday everyone! ☺️😊 .\n<br />|\n<br />#GoodFriday #ThankYouJesus #ThankGod #Grateful #Salvation #GoodNews
Let\'s embrace a fresh new beginning! Perfect dessert for a bittersweet moment. ☕️🍫🍦 Can\'t wait for a bigger, newer @percolatecoffee three weeks later ! #Percolate #Cafehoppingsg #SgCafe #EileenWantsToCampHere
Although the red velvet cake came highly recommended, we opted for the less indulgent earl grey bundt cake instead. I wish it was a teenie weenie bit more moist, but the infusion of the tea\'s flavours was spot on. Good coffee too!
Buttery and soft croissant, eat it while it\'s warm. Latte was jus the way I like it. 👍
But! At least the cakes here were really pleasant. 🍰🍰🍰🍰\n<br />Both hot favorites of the place, salted caramel cheesecake (left) and carrot cake (right) were certainly worth the calories. The cheesecake were really moist and fluffy while the carrot cake tasted really good with the frosting! Definitely worth coming again. 😏\n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood
A hidden gem at Bedok North, Percolate is a cosy cafe that serves coffee, tea and cakes. Non pretentious, homely and a place to chill the afternoon away.
Trying out their \"limited edition\", only available on weekends Pandan Chiffon Cake ($3.50). Hmm... It\'s soft and moist but I can\'t seem to discriminate it from the ones we can get at the old school bakeries!
Delaying or postponing something until one has had one or more cups of coffee; drinking coffee slowly as a delaying tactic.
Sandwich Tom Yum Grilled Chicken is one of the unique sandwich at a HDB Shophouse cafe. The Tom Yum taste is strong enough and with the tenderness of the chicken make it more delicious. It\'s has mild spicy. The whole sandwich can fill your stomach. Price: $10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The sweetness is just right for me, the crumble is filled with pear filling. It\'s very delicious, together with a coffee is perfect! My cosy place, best for small group and couple gathering. We didn\'t stay long than expected as to give our seating to incoming crowd. $4 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
For those who are not sure about OZ, it mean Ounce. If to convert to ml is about 148ml. Anyway the owner is super friendly and he will give you suggestions on the coffee if you enquire. There are limited seats available. $5 for 5 Oz. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The rain messed up my plans to swim. Hiding in here for the storm to pass.
A really cosy place with really nice deco! The whole time I was there I was just so I love with the deco and it\'s good chai tea! It was featured on Channelnews Asia so I decided to stop by to try it out! Though the cakes are to as good as the coffee it was still a really nice place to go to with good music . The cakes you should try is the salted caramel ,still better than red velvet! 
Just a stone\'s throw away from my place, I love coming here! Cosy ambience and friendly service. ☺ Absolutely love their sandwiches and crossiants.
Honey Chamomile Cake, Raspberry Rose Cake are just a few of the unique cakes Ive tried in Singapore. Nice ambiance &amp; really great staff :) 
...thanks for the coffee @ethan_edgar. nice catching up with you.
Happy National day! 
It\'s really wonderful when it comes to the beauty of coffee because the flavour profile just changes with even ice cubes added. The Iced White here is mildly acidic, milky but somehow earthy as well; rather different from the usual White that I will order. Soothing for the scorching weather out there now.
I must say, i almost missed this place. And even my friend who lived her whole life in bedok, didnt know about this place. I like how it\'s quiet and peaceful. And the service given was really awesome! The people there were nice and friendly, even recommended some items on the menu too. The red velvet cake was perfect! It wasnt too sweet or too spongey. The ICED CHOCOLATE IS DA BOMB!! Must try!!!! In all, it wasnt expensive too, unlike others. 👍👍👍 really thumbs up for this place. Sorry for the shitty i-want-to-feel-hipster-abit photo, felt embarrassed taking this shot. Lol
Crispy and light croissant , goes well wz the passionate fruit jam...
Not too sweet, really soft and easy on the taste buds.  Perfect!
Delicious slice of Salted Caramel cake. Really soft and tasty as well.
What makes it perfect is when you still want to be part of it when everything sucks. But leave if you know you have to, don\'t be stupid. 🙅 // Coffee and red velvet cake for the soul.
Went to try out Percolate before they got very popular as it was really nearby my place. Basically good food, good service and good atmosphere. I love the whole HDB shop house concept.
Tried out the pear crumble danish. A little hard for danish but tastes ok. Iced black feels a tad too acidic for my liking.
Frou-frou to the max, this is girlishness in cake form. Its lightweight crumb and floral scent makes it unabashedly feminine. 
I\'m surprised there were no bees buzzing around me when I was having this. The honey flavour was pretty intense. 
Super friendly owners who are jovial and warm. Totally brings up the atmosphere, making you feel so comfortable and at home. Serving Papa Palheta\'s Terra Firma which leaves a slightly brighter after taste (for my piccolo latte) compared to the usual throwback I\'ve had. But when balanced (in the case of latte) it tastes pretty similar to throwback 😅😅 (lousy tongue I\'ve) btw ITS A MUST TO ORDER THE ICED CHOCOLATE ITS REALLY THE BOMBZ OKKK and the Bananoffe cake 👍👍 Pastries are supplied by BAO (what\'s new?) haha if it\'s not in the east, I\'ll probably frequent them pretty often. 
The new wave of cafés are slowly popping out and good news for Easties with the opening of the small but cosy café, Percolate. Seats are really limited so do expect to wait if you do not come at the right time. Nothing pretentious, just a very humble café that focuses on the food which they got from different places. Saw that the café uses Papa Pahelta Terra Firma for their coffee, but I have no idea what is that since I am no coffee connoisseur.
Made my way \'far east\' to Bedok North Ave 3 and surprised to find a very small but sincere and humble cafe. The Red Velvet is by a home-baker, good stuff, not artificial.
Having a cup of hot chocolate and lychee cake relaxing in a small cozy corner is really wonderful
Friendly staffs and cosy environment, they even personally bring \'deco\' to aid in food taking.
Banana Date Loaf was moist and sweet. Pair it with a cup of latte to wash off the natural sweetness from the banana and date. Crowd is good after lunch. Good place to relax. Coffee is affordable too! 
A quick morale booster before his revision for the last two papers. Hang in there bro! The end is near!💪 #vsco #vscocam #foodporn
May the 4th be with you. 
#lategram . I love the banana date loaf however we found the choc esspresso tart base too dry for our likening. Oh they have introduced some savoury sandwiches to their menu. And have I mentioned that there is no gst nor service charge at this cafe? *^▁^*
Earl grey bundt cake and honey chamomile cake. 
Mushy bananas and generous amount of chewy dates; definitely something that suits my palate!
Cozy new cafe in bedok!
Percolate is a newly opened cafe in the heartland (Bedok ) . We love what we ate last night. Earl grey bundt was flavorful and light while the pear crumble was quite a delight to me: ) thou we tot the pastry was a bit hard.. coffee beans are from Papa Palheta.
The ice latte is the right cuppa for my type and the level of acidity is just right for me. Cakes I ordered still need some improvement on it. Definitely good place to have a cup of coffee and relax your mind after work or during off days .
Was initially tart but turned out a bit too sour afterwards for me. Egg tart base which was easy to cut.
A lovely cuppa made of Papa Pahelta Terra Firma blend. Fruity and acidic.
Looks decent but overly dry on the inside, not to mention the even drier top to mimick some form of crustiness.

The orangey taste was really distinct and really went quite well with their coffee giving it a nice refreshing touch.
How reluctant to go back to work. 😩
But for someone who has sweet-tooth, I was looking for some sweetness in it. Or is it that the Orange Mocha drink overpowered the flavour? Hmm.
Tried the hot green tea latte ($5.50), which was rich and creamy, with a prominent matcha flavour that many green tea lattes seem to be lacking in, as well as the smoked salmon wasabi cream cheese croissant ($9)! The croissant was fresh and flaky, but could\'ve been warmer, and the cream cheese had a good amount of tongue-tingling wasabi (so pls get a drink on the side if you have low spice tolerance like me). Didn\'t try the black velvet cake ($7) but my friend enjoyed it!
🍰
Coffee from @percolatecoffee is always 👍👍👍 The Kaya crossiant is yummy too😋😋😋
Finally! \n<br />Good morning⛅️\n<br />Start your day with some positive vibes☺️
How does the latter taste you may ask? To me, it tasted like a unsweetened fizzy orange juice, with a slight hint of coffee at the end.
1) Crossiant \n<br />2) Carrot Cake\n<br />3) Coffee
Decadent dark chocolate filling peppered with crunchy hazelnuts.

Tried their salted caramel cake and mocha. Total $10.50. Good place to chill and great coffee. The cake is average. Attentive to details and give water and refills. Thumbs up.
:\') This cafe is another reason to love bedok! @post_eatz says it\'s his fav place for coffee now! 😂👍🏻

In the process, get a cup of Coffee Caviar Shooters ($4.50) to go along with it. I was pleasantly surprised by this as it was coffee mousse with some whipped cream on top. In it are those miniature cute coffee caviar that added a surprise element to the drink. How awesome it would be if those balls are able to burst out coffee liquid.
Also, today is Eat With Your Family Day, which means early knock-off from work today! \n<br />#foodart #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #pickatsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehopping #percolate
Such an innovative idea to have curry spices in egg mayo, and the best part to pair with a warm buttery croissant. The newly revamped Percolate 2.0 is much bigger with a slightly different decor. Menu has also been upsized to include more items, so do pay them a visit soon!
#percolatesg
It\'s good.
A brownie sits at the bottom of a stout, wide-rimmed glass, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then doused in a caramel-ly shot of espresso. Simple as it sounds, we couldn\'t stop shovelling this into our mouths. Our favourite part was the espresso-soaked brownie, which was so moist it was more of a pudding, really. Can\'t wait to be back.
That day\'s blend was the Four Chairs blend from Nylon. It was goood.
Doing nothing.
Percolate 2.0.

How about some croissant &amp; brownie to start the day? Gather I post a @percolatecoffee pic since we might just drop by later in the day! Here\'s featuring the stars of #percolatecoffee, the Curry Egg Mayo Croissant and the Brownie Affogato. I\'ve got a thing for very harsh 12 noon sharp sunlight. Not the most flattering and the norm thing for food shots but then again, define normal. [Percolate\n<br />136 Bedok North Avenue 3\n<br />Singapore 460136\n<br />8259 0316]

Lusciously velvety milk foam on a deep, mellow espresso. Hop by for a cuppa after a fiery meal at Nakhon a few doors down.

Loving their coffee here..
Wonderful flavour but would have loved it more if it was served warm! :) My family frequents this #café not only because of their fragrant #coffee and #yummy #pastries, but also because the service is consistently excellent! Expect friendly and courteous baristas who make you feel at home!

Seen this so many time in photos that I needed to try it! Essentially Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice-Cream and a shot of Espresso drizzled atop, each bite comes with a tinge of sweetness, a bit of bitterness of the espresso which made the brownie soft and smooth and a nice aromatic fragrance from the rich and smooth ball of Vanilla Ice-Cream over the top. There was a slight acidity in this dessert though; possibly from the blends they use for the Espresso though.

#Passionfruit, #MangoandLime, and #SpicedPumpkin! Finished my #croissants before I could finish my #jam, and was so tempted to order more! I love this #bedok #cafe!
