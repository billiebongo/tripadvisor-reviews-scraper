Can\'t decide which of the new Sea Bass dishes I like better at Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe. I like this for the tender flesh and sweet turmeric sauce, but I like the Thai Sambal version for the spicy kick and crisp texture! Too many good choices at Spicy Thai-Thai, plus their casual setting is a great place to catch up with a group of friends whilst enjoying a wide range of good Thai food.
Fragrant and steaming with the aroma of white pepper and coriander root, each serving is prepared with one whole bag of clams, imparting its sweet shellfish essence to the simmering broth that\'s greedily soaked up by the vermicelli noodles.
Such a unique dish from the lesser known Isaan cuisine up north in Thailand, Hommok is Thai-style otak made with eggs, Thai red curry paste, assorted seafood such as prawn and squid, and fresh young coconut flesh, rustically served in a coconut shell. 
A lip smacking aromatic sweet sauce bathes the expertly fried fish, which retains a slight crispiness in its skin despite being soaked in all that goodness, and tender flaky white flesh within that speaks for the product\'s freshness. Perfect with a bowl of Thai jasmine rice.
Made a reservation and expected huge crowd on a Saturday evening. Oddly, the place was not even half filled when we arrived at 7pm. \n<br />We ordered most of their signature dishes, and food were served very efficiently. \n<br />Deep fried kang kong $10 - generous portion but extremely oily, barely able to taste the veggie\n<br />Stir fried basil minced pork $10 - standard dish in small serving \n<br />Hommok otah $18 - uniquely served in coconut shell, with generous seafood ingredients. The texture was different from how I expected it to be, more like a otah-coconut milk soup. Would enjoy it even more if it\'s spicier and less sweet \n<br />Crab tang hoon $45 (standard price per crab ~600g) - yes, I expressed my love for the peppery tang hoon more than the crab. Crab was deep fried before stir-frying with tang hoon, such a waste. \n<br />Clear tom yam soup $7 for a small portion - clear is always better than milky for me. \n<br /> \n<br />P.s. The restaurant also serves mookata set.
Thai style otah in coconut husk. \n<br />Tasted as good as it looks. 😋
Suddenly craving for good crab. Have you ever tried Thai-style Curry Crab? 🦀🦀🦀 #throwback
😷 \n<br />This is really so comforting you must try- {Fish Maw Crab meat Abalone soup in coconut husk} one of my fave dishes from @spicythaithaicafe just because it\'s soup and I love soup 😛\n<br />#spicythaithaicafe #rachyyadverts
3.5 munchies: Undoubtedly the hot favourite from Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe, the well-cooked bee hoon was loaded with lala (clams), wolfberries and onions. I would have liked it less peppery to bring out the sweetness of the tasty clam-based broth, though. Do ask for chilli padi for those who want to level up their game!
Call us lucky or what, as we had the Thai Style Curry Prawns (Seasonal price) that is usually prepared using crabs. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise, because the prawns were delectable and fresh, and easier to eat than crabs 😂 \n<br />You know my style lah, find something positive in everything! Anyway, the best part was the addition of coconut milk that brings the curry to another level of aroma and punch! \n<br />Thank you @spicythaithaicafe and @fatwithin the hosted meal! \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile.

@spicythaithaicafe is one of my fav. My 2nd time back to Spicy Thai Thai and their food never disappoint me. Some special dishes to highlights are
Spicy Thai Thai has a very extensive menu and here are some dishes that we tried the other night! My favorites are the Stir Fried Fish Maw with Crabmeat and Bean Sprouts ($18) and the Lala Beehoon ($18). Seems like hearty Thai food can always be found in the heartlands!
Hammok ($18) - Thai version of otah served in a young coconut husk. \n<br />Can\'t help but dig spoon after spoon for the fluffy, scrambled egg texture of the otah, with a mix of seafood (prawns, squid) and coconut flesh. The addictive dish was extra creamy with the extra splash of coconut milk!
0.5 munchies: The dish that I disliked the most from the media tasting menu; also one of the worst I\'ve ever eaten. I couldn\'t appreciate the overly-charred taste and slightly powdery texture of the barbecued Japanese squid. What threw me off totally was the shrimp roe dipping – a hardened, gritty paste that tasted like seafood gone bad. It was so wretchedly bad that I don\'t understand how anyone could possibly savour the awful taste and texture at all!
Spicy Thai - Thai Restaurant\'s Lala Bee Hoon ($18) came in a close second on my favourites list from the restaurant, with the Hammok Thai style otah taking top spot.
4.5 munchies: Served in a coconut shell, the flavourful, starchy broth contained generous servings of fish maw, crab meat, mushrooms, and two pieces of abalone. What I really loved about this dish was the subtle sweetness from the coconut that added depth and fragrance to the tasty soup. I wiped out the entire bowl – meant for 2-3 to share – greedily to myself!
Simple yet full of flavor (&amp; extremely spicy), the Basil Pork was easy to finish, if I had plain rice with me. Otherwise, get ready your tissue packets cause you\'d be perspiring bucket loads &amp; sniffing away. \n<br />Special thanks to @fatwithin &amp; @spicythaithaicafe for your hospitality!
.\n<br />Essence of premium ingredients all in a coconut, so good that NanaTang can\'t stop slurping.\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks to @fatwithin for having us and @uricacxy jie jie for sharing the love. 😘
Was introduced to a round of new selection like the Grilled Squid with Roe (Seasonal Price), Deep Fried Seabass (Seasonal price), BBQ Pork Belly ($18), Thai Style Curry Crab (Seasonal Price), Stir-Fry Fish Maw ($18 - this was really good) and lots more!! Pictured here is still my old time favourite - Lala Bee Hoon ($18).
This is a Thai style otah that has been perfectly cooked in a young coconut and the spiced fish mixture has been enhanced with chunks of prawns and coconut. A clear winner with that additional oomph from the coconut cream.
These sinful yet addictive pieces of pork belly will throw any diet plans off the window. Well, diet can wait when these perfectly caramelized BBQ meats are on the table. Best to have it original or if you prefer a slight spicy kick, you can dip it with the accompanying chilli mix.
For fans of this street food, this will definitely appeal to you as the chewy texture and slightly charred aroma makes it a very interesting snack. The pairing condiment, a shrimp roe mixture has an acquired taste which might not appeal to all.
.
My favourite dish at Spicy Thai-Thai cos of the clams. Lip smackingly good. Just gimme a plate of this and my belly will be very happy.\n<br />♬ lala lala lala ♬ (๑¯◡¯๑) \n<br />Thanks again @fatwithin for the generous invite and @spicythaithaicafe for feeding us. :)\n<br />#SpicyThaiThaiCafe *
Love the lovely aroma of the coconut that lured me subtly to the rich and flavorsome broth with GENEROUS ingredients. I would come back any time for this! Plus it is so near my office!
This one is addictive. I can have them as a snack!! 😉
Both were equally yummy. But if you like lemongrass, go for the fish cakes. 
a generous portion of lala accompanies the bee hoon.
Request to amp up the spiciness if you\'re up for it. One of the best I\'ve tasted in SG. Truly!
Tender flesh and a super tangy soup base to wake the tastebuds.\n<br />⋅\n<br />Thanks @FatWithin and @SpicyThaiThaiCafe for hosting us tonight and @peroro_ for the invite! It was great meeting everyone tonight!\n<br />⋅\n<br />#SpicyThaiThaiCafe
The fish was really well done - Cat Fish are usually muddy but this was free of it! Love the heavy spices for the dishes but it can get slightly on the spicier side! Shiok but 🔥🔥🔥 Thank you @spicythaithaicafe for having us, @fatwithin for the warm hospitality and @thechoyalicious for extending the invite!
all I knew was that the dishes came out like a rattling machine gun nesting on this brown table.
The bee hoon was accented with their scrumptious homemade stock and every mouth was bursting with wok hei and piquant fragrance. \n<br />It also absorbed the fresh sweetness of the exquisitely briny clams, with each bite being more delicious than the last. The proportion of the clams to the bee hoon was probably at least 2:1 for each mouthful of joy!\n<br />Thank you Spicy Thai and @fatwithin for the hosted meal! \n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!

This is very different from the usual Otak wrapped with banana leaves. \n<br />The custard-alike texture was accompanied with coconut flesh bits and was comfortably served warm.\n<br />Infused with an array of flavours like red curry and eggs, it was so addictive I can probably have this dish alone with a bowl of rice.\n<br />Thank you Spicy Thai for the hosted meal and @fatwithin for entertaining us!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
I love how the bee hoon soaking up the peppery broth with a wok hei flavor, and further enhanced by the sweetness of the generous amount of clams in it. The next time if I have any cravings for Lala bee hoon again, I know where to go to! 😉😉😉

[Spicy Thai - Thai Cafe] Finally had the opportunity to try the much raved about Lala Bee Hoon ($18) last week. A dish that looked simple but packed with a hadoken-punch, most probably from the broth which the chef went heavy on the peppery side.
Nailing that delicate balance between the briny clams and flavourful broth is this amazing fried bee hoon. The noodles were silky smooth, soaking up all that stunning smokey broth. This is the epitome of a rustic dish executed with such grace and perfection. To think I never found something as stunning as this in Thailand itself.
If you\'re looking for a dish that\'s spicy, peppery and fills you up, this is it! Comes with large portions of lala coupled with the peppery wetness. I would have preferred larger portions of bee hoon. Enjoyed it!
Smoky charcoaled pork neck that has been lightly brushed with BBQ sauce. Meaty and juicy with just the right level of hardness. A great dish to have with a plate of rice or if you really love meat, this would just be another wonderful snack that you can\'t stop chewing on!
The most generous amount of lala clams I have ever had. I love the strong briny stocks with wok-hei flavour which glaze every single strand of the bee hoon while the sweet lala clams complement it. It was such a hearty portion and was definitely meant for sharing. A hidden gem indeed!
Missing this so much right now. It\'s the spicy fish paste that we locals so love, just softer and mousse-like, and stuffed full with ocean bounty. Prawns, squid, fish, you name it. Chunks of fresh seafood and shredded sweet coconut flesh interlaced with that rich spicy paste - need I say more?
It was the Hommok (Thai-style otah) that I travelled here for, but I ended up loving every dish we had on the table. I can\'t decide which ones I like more! Every dish was fragrant and bursting with spices.
The soup was suitably sharp and spicy, and should sufficiently satisfy all heat-seekers. The flames just kept on going and going, so you get the soup piping hot throughout the meal! However, the soup somehow lacked a certain oooooh, a certain umami that some of its contemporaries (ParaThai comes to mind) possess, so you’d just be riding the decidedly one-note tang train throughout. 3.7/5
The very wet bee hoon strides in with an unabashedly fiesty and peppery sass, taking absolutely no prisoners and instantly triggering ooohs of ardourous appreciation and approval from my dining companions. But for the fact that prawns beat clams any day, this would have been a major contender for the peppery bee hoon throne (which, personally, The Prawn Star currently holds with an iron grip). 4.3/5
Wildly different from its more sadistic Red Tom Yum Soup sibling on the menu. The tom yum soup was robustly spicy yet at the same time sweet and not too milky, and I enjoyed the uncommon inclusion of coconut slices, which added an uncharacteristic crunch to the proceedings.  4/5
I just love the generous amount of dill used in the omelette. Best with rice!
Didn\'t know what to expect when i heard the name of the dish and saw it coming onto the table. When i first try it, i was really amazed at how delicious it was. Sweet yet spicy. A unique and different style from the regular otak we have. Seafood with bits of coconut flesh. 😋\n<br />#spicythaithaicafe
This is the Walking Catfish with spicy lemon soup. Trendy guy, got nose piercing somemore.
The tang hoon was soooo good - it was cooked perfectly and was nice and springy. It was also really infused with the flavours from the crab and black pepper. The pepper also made it spicy - super shiok to slurp it up into your mouth. The crab was rather fresh, no complaints there. Overall a really satisfying dish and a must have for crab-lovers!
Nicely rearranged by another tastemaker @zippyzipeng, making this wonderful dish even more good looking! Personally I found the crab meat to be above average and pretty fresh, it was also strangely sweet and the black pepper taste was more focused and concentrated on the vermicelli rather than the crab itself! I have no complains though! Ate lots of the vermicelli instead of the crab! 😅😅
The presentation of this dish already caught our attention. It looked like a hot, bubbling mess of deliciousness, and thankfully it tasted as such also. The otak is unlike your traditional ones where they are served in slices and is flour-based. It had more of a pudding consistency, and was egg-based. It was rich, creamy, and had an extra sweetness as they use fresh coconut flesh to cook it. I am certainly spoilt now because I will always be comparing other otaks to this. Having said that, the downside is that you will probably be unable to stomach too much as it is a little heavy. Regardless, definitely should order this dish to share!
At $28, I felt that this was really reasonable for a whole fish which was quite big and had a lot of meat. The fish is pre-sliced which makes for easy extraction. It was fresh, and the meat was quite tender and soft. The dish is kept hot by a charcoal flame, which somehow does not overcook the fish despite burning for the entire duration of the dinner. A lot of the flavour comes from the soup, which was slightly sour and spicy. Should definitely give this a try! 
Similar to Singapore\'s otah, I had assumed that it would be very spicy. However, this dish had many surprises! It came in a real coconut husk, one could really savor the coconut juices with every spoon! There were also fresh shrimps and fish slices found within the sea of scrambled-egg-ish otak! The most surprising of all was that there were even coconut slices in it and it made the entire dish even more refreshing! In my opinion this dish is what would people deem as a fusion food done right! 
If you\'re looking for good and authentic Thai food, Spicy Thai- Thai Cafe is the place for you. One of their signature dishes is their lala beehoon, and it is easy to see why. It is cooked with a healthy dose of white pepper which gives it a good kick for those who like their food spicy. The pepper really adds to the flavour as well, and it is made even tastier due to the lala which adds a nice sweetness to it. This is a must-have here. Overall, really impressed with this dish and the food here. 
All my life I had only ate the Chinese version of lala bee hoon and often found them too wet to my liking. This however managed to balance the wetness of the dish very well! Even towards finishing the dish the bee hoon was still spongy and chewy and did not have \"soaked\" taste to it. La la was fresh and there were generous amount of it given! Remember to mix it well before eating it to enjoy the full flavor of the dish! 
This bowl of tom yum soup was chock-full of flavour. Fresh coconut flesh was used to cook it, and the sweetness of the coconut helped to enhance its taste. The seafood used was fresh, which is always a must for a good tom yum soup. 
Having tried many different kinds of Tom Yam Soup in Singapore, this one managed to stand out from the others through its unique usage of coconut The soup was creamy, yet sweet and spicy at the same time! Along with the standard mix of seafood, there were also slices of coconut which went surprisingly well with the soup! Despite the spiciness of the soup, the slices of coconut were able to bring about a refreshing taste to the  tastebuds and it was interesting to have something to crunch on while drinking the soup! Spicy Thai-Thai cafe serves North Eastern Thai food rather than those usual bangkok-ish kind, it is strongly recommended to anyone who wants a decent, spicy and different kind of Tom Yam Soup in Singapore! 
You know eating too much of this sinful dish is bad for you, but you probably can\'t stop. The pork is fried to golden perfection, and the garlic bits add not only flavour but a nice crunchy texture to it. The pork was a little chewy and a bit too fatty for my liking, but lovers of pork belly will surely fall in love with this. 
Everyone loves a good omelette, and I felt that this place does it pretty well. The egg was crispy outside, but still soft and fluffy inside. The dill herb added a crunch to the eggs, which makes it a little more interesting than other omelettes. Tbh, taste-wise there wasn\'t much of a difference; nevertheless, still impressed by the omelette here!
One of my favourite dish from last night\'s media invite. Loving the taste of the tom yum mixed with coconut. Definitely a new taste and a special twist to the normal tom yum i always have. #spicythaithaicafe
What sorcery is this? A Thai gem hidden in the quaint neighborhood at 115 Aljunied Avenue 2 (quite an offbeat location) but still accessible by public transport.
Food was tasty enough but portions were TINY for the price. Unlikely a place I would return to 🌟🌟
If you only order one item from Spicy Thai - Thai Café, let it be this. Smokier than a singlet at Chomp Chomp on Saturday nights at 9PM and more tender (although equally charred) than the flesh of a tanned, buff dragonboater wearing said singlet, with just enough fat to give it a juicy gnaw factor. 4.3/5
Like Willy Wonka\'s Three Course Dinner Chewing Gum, this soup morphs from form to form while it swishes in your mouth, all within seconds - it starts off as piquant tomato bisque, then becomes classic spicy tom yum soup, but in the final few seconds it reveals itself as a vicious banshee who unleashes a devastation scratchfest on your tongue while screeching shrilly before finally being dragged down your throat. Not for the faint-hearted, but spice seekers and Arctic travellers who need fire in their bellies would revel in ecstasy. For the picture, I went for Venetian Drainwater Chic. 3.8/5
Thai Red Emperor Fish Snapper with lotsa garlic, chilli padi and lime😍 Flavours are bang on. More about the delicious Thai food from #spicythaithaicafe on blog👆#年年有鱼
Perfectly stewed beehoon with an addictive peppery kick and generous serving of Lala (overheard at the table - are we eating beehoon or Lala?) Feasted on some 15 yummy dishes at Spicy Thai Thai Cafe last night (burp)! Really lovely down to earth restaurant serving north-eastern Thai cuisine with some fusion elements.
Another MUST TRY is their Lala (Clams) Fried Bee Hoon which is a new addition to the menu. The chef is a deft hand at balancing the flavours of ingredients to achieve that perfect equilibrium between the delicately briny clams and the flavoursome stock to fry this delicious pot of bee hoon, toeing the line between rusticity and refinement with impressive balance. 
Petai is one of my Favourite bean, especially cooked with sambal Prawn, Super yummy! And this bean has very good health benefits.
Barbecued honey chicken wings! This is really really really fantastic! Cousin\'s treat :)
Tom Yum Goong served steamboat style heated by charcoal! http://danielfooddiary.com/2013/06/10/spicythaithaicafe/
Recently try out a new place for Moo Ka Ta. Thanks to @pauline_lim22 who saw it on newspaper 😊  It\'s really not bad! Will be back to try their tom yum soup &amp; other dishes
Checking out new Thai style coffee shop at Aljunied. First looks, hot (no aircon) but promising!
-\n<br />A simple yet comforting dish. Silky Cold Tofu with Special Thai Seafood Sauce ($16) is served cold, and well-complemented with the special thai seafood sauce. Personally I would prefer tofu to be served hot, a refreshing change nonetheless.\n<br />-\n<br />Probably not as common as its seafood Tomyum cousin, Kaeng Som Cha Om soup (aka Thai Sour Curry, $18) is equally appetizing. Generous serving of fried egg omelette and fresh vegetables, all simmered in the sour and sharp soup base, characteristic of Northeastern Thai cuisine. Charcoal is used, evident of their determination to prepare food the authentic way, at the same time enhancing the taste of the dish.\n<br />-\n<br />Thai Sambal Sea Bass (Seasonal Price) would be a perfect choice for seafood lovers who enjoy a spicy (and manageable) kick.  The generous spread of sambal has a great depth of flavour, forms a perfect coat for the crispy fried fish. Have this on its own, or with white rice to truly complete the meal.\n<br />.\n<br />Thank you @spicythaithaicafe @fatwithin @justinfoodprints for the invite.\n<br />==========\n<br />📍Spicy Thai Thai\n<br />Blk 115 Aljunied Avenue 2\n<br />#01-35\n<br />(S) 380115\n<br />==========\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple  #wishuponatart_eats #thailand #thai #thaifood #thailandfood #seafood #clam

4 munchies: The Isaan-style otak-otak is one of the must-order dishes at this HDB-based eatery that serves authentic Thai cuisine. Made with mackerel, squid, prawns, eggs, Thai red curry paste, and coconut milk, the full-bodied flavour of the fish paste was excellent. The pudding-like texture was creamy and so fluffy; spices were well-balanced. Aesthetics aside, serving it in a coconut husk with flesh also gave that extra sweetness to balance the richness of the dish! #Burpproved
Coconut dessert? You are wrong. It’s Thai otak aka Hommok in the coconut shell. Besides the usual minced fish meat that is commonly found in otah. You will spot slices of coconut flesh with seafood surprises eg. prawn and squid bites in every mouthful! There is also traces of turmeric powder that leaves a little earthy aroma note on the after-taste. Definitely one of a kind!\n<br />.\n<br />Hommok (Thai Otak) at S$18.\n<br />.\n<br />Read on foodgem.sg/food/thai/spicy-thai-thai-cafe\n<br />.\n<br />Where to dine? \n<br />Spicy Thai Thai Cafe\n<br />115 Aljunied Avenue 2, #01-35, Singapore 380115\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#SpicyThaiThaiCafe #Otah #hommok \n<br />#aljunied #thaifood #thaicuisine
No need to snatch anymore 😄 I like ground white pepper that enhanced the natural flavours of the lala, this brings out the exquisite taste and texture of this dish.

Simple yet statisfying with stong wok-hei.
Only regret is that I ordered it to be less spicy, which reduced the peppery goodness. Will go full on next time for maximum flavour! 🌶🌶🌶 #spicythai #spicy #thaifood #spicythaithaicafe #asian #asia #igsg #burrple #burrplesg #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #foodporn #foodforfoodies #foodforlife #foodforfuel #foodpics #foodphotography #whatiate #whatiatetoday #foodlover #fooddiary #8dayseat #sgfood #sgeats #foodpornsg #foodnography #lala #seafood #clams #あさり

Surprisingly filled with \'wok hei\', but it could be better if the fried salted fish was crispy instead of stiff.

A dish that looked simple but packed with a hadoken-punch, most probably from the broth which the chef went heavy on the peppery side.\n<br />.\n<br />Once the bee hoon has soaked up all the soupy goodness, your previous perception of plain bee hoon will be thrown out of the window. Accompanying the noodles were fresh clams, which added a certain level of seafood-ness into the entire dish. Topping if all off, spring onions were added into the mix and the coriander garnish provided an aromatic freshness.\n<br />.\n<br />This was a hosted meal by @spicythaithaicafe and many thanks to @fatwithin for the invite.\n<br />.\n<br />Address: Block 115, Aljunied Avenue 2, Unit 01-35, Singapore 380115\n<br />============================\n<br />#onthetable #BurppleSG #Burpple #BurppleTastemaker #TastemakersEatup #foodporn #foodphoto #foodstagram #photooftheday #foodphotography #vscofood #whati8today #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #sgvsco #instasg #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #sgcafe #sgcafefood\n<br />============================
