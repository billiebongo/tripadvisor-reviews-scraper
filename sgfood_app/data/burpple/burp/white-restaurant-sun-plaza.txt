Indeed it lives up to its name. 😋🖒 Can order the salted egg yolk sotong here, unlike Sun Plaza\'s (super tough to chew 😅) #burpple
One of my usual brunch craves when I manage to roll outta bed after a night out clubbing 😂

We asked for fish instead of prawns 🍤 because the boy remembered his allergies this time and the white chunks came tasty fresh with a tender spring with plentiful portions of ingredients. Squeeze in lime and slurp up White Beehoon (medium $8), pairing your mouthfuls with yolky egg bits fried so fragrant. Slightly springy, the noodles soak some of the generous stock but not till it goes mushy, giving it a pleasantly soft bite. The hint of citrus combines deliciously with the rich gravy, mixing the sweetness of seafood and egg with that slight wok hei. Lightly savoury, it’s the brunch I’ve woken up craving for more often than once.\n<br />.\n<br />http://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/2017/01/14/White-Restaurant-SunPlaza

The salted egg prawn balls were good, but were too pricey ($16 for M)
Good enough for 3 to 4 pax, I love the white eggs gravy and it goes very well with the Belacan Chilli.
Honest feedback: The food tastes good, but its slightly overpriced. However, the waiting time is so much shorter than the outlet near sembawang shopping centre. Among all of those dishes in this picture, i prefer the white beehoon the most. Probably because im not really someone who can take chilli well so the mee goreng was kinda spicy for me (but still try it, its delicious). Theres different \"sizes\" for each dish and the portion is quite obvious from the picture, we ordered L for the white beehoon, M for the meegoreng and S for the other respective dishes. Satisfying and filling for a group of four! Worth a try but remember, if you opened the wet tissues provided on the table with the cutleries, you have to pay for it at the cashier too 😂
Thanks for bringing me out for awesome food 😍
Try to head over early because the queue would be very long and parking might seem to be a problem. \n<br />But I assure you, it\'s worth the wait!🍴 #whitebeehoon #sembawangwhitebeehoon #musttry #goodfood
It\'s like a zichar stall, signature dish.
