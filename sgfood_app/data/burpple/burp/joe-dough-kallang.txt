The brand new 4C cake from @joendough sounds like the perfect sin - Cookie, Chocolate, Cheese and Coffee, with a hint of Clara to make it better. HAHA!
3.5 munchies: Another fusion item to rejoice over the Golden Jubilee weekend, the Flourless Chocolate Coconut Cake was pretty delectable from the warm and moist gula melaka centre, coconut shavings, and the three cute little white chocolate-filled onde-onde. It could have been an impressive, multi-textured dessert if the cake were slightly more dense.
If you haven\'t heard, Joe &amp; Dough has just launched their SG50 menu with a lineup of food and beverages that will be served from 1-31 August 2015. My pick on the drink of the day has definitely got to be the hot Bandung Cafe Latte ($5.50, $6.30 for Iced version). The aromatic from the Rose syrup with the distinctive richness from the milk makes it a smoothing warm feeling from drinking it. Do give it a try before it runs out.
Thick, chocolaty taste that will astonish even the most die-hard chocolate lover. For those with sweet tooth, you can also choose to have it with marshmallows ($5.70) like we did. But beware, it is really sweet!
Here\'s the SG50 special that @joendough has for you: Truffle Mashed Egg ($8.50). SUPER AFFORDABLE and pretty rich truffle taste at some parts, atop the fluffy soft bread. Ah.. Am I in heaven yet? üòá
Happy weekends everybody! Joe &amp; Dough will be launching their SG50 menu items starting tomorrow till 31 August and one of the items is the Soy Sauce Chicken Achar Sandwich ($8.80). We have seen achar in chicken rice but bet you have not had achar with chicken in a bread combination. The tanginess of the achar and savoury chicken makes a good contrast from the usual sandwich rolls. The first thought that came to my mind upon the first bite is that it\'s a crossover between a deconstructed chicken rice dish and a Vietnamese B√°nh m√¨ (love the crunch from the sour pickles). Overall, this Soy Sauce Chicken Achar Sandwich can pass lah.

4.5 munchies: Who\'d have thought of the brilliant combination of soy sauce chicken and achar in the same dish? I absolutely enjoyed the chunky, well-marinated soy sauce chicken that balanced the spicy, sour and mildly sweet pickled vegetables. For a true local experience, pair it with the other two SG50 items ‚Äì Bandung Cafe Latte and Durian Profiteroles for dessert.
On the Menu will be this Soy Sauce Chicken &amp; ACHAR Gourmet Sandwich ($8.80) of tender well marinated soy chicken that surprisingly goes well with the sourish spicy achar. \n<br />Give it a go with their other SG50 items like the hot Bandung Cafe Latte ($5.50) &amp; DURIAN profiteroles($4.80). This was a hosted tasting, thanks for the invite #joendoughsg &amp; #burpple!
After all the feasting over the weekends, start the new week right by having the healthy Granola Yogurt Bowl with the latest power food, chia seeds. A medley of Greek yogurt, honey, granola, raisins and chia seeds will surely brighten up even the dullest mood. Now, who says healthy food is boring? It can be made exciting with the right combination of ingredients.
Look no further for Joe &amp; Dough\'s artisanal sandwiches are here to satisfy your palate. \n<br />Up your game with the Soy Sauce Chicken &amp; Achar ($8.80) sandwich. The unlikely sweet and salty combination of tender, thick cuts chicken and sweet achar worked well for me, making that-other-sandwich-place pale in comparison. \n<br />This item is a SG50 limited item, only available from 1 August to 31 August, so make sure you get your hands, i mean mouth, on this smooth chick. \n<br />Other limited SG50 items include the Mao Shan Wang Durian Profiteroles and the Bandung Cafe Latte. \n<br />This was a hosted tasting courtesy of @joendough. Thanks for having us.
The bowl is topped with dried raisins, almond and Chia Seeds. Chia seeds are loaded with nutrients (fibre, protein, Omega-3 fatty acids etc) - that has health benefits to us. So you\'ll get to enjoy wholesome menu at the same time.
4 munchies: It wasn\'t until my third sip that I started to appreciate the peculiar combination of bandung and coffee. The non-overpowering rose cordial syrup gave a nice contrast to the strong-bodied and smooth cafe latte, albeit the sweetness could be toned down a little. I\'m looking forward to trying the hot version when it becomes available next week!
Life is too short for bad coffee indeed. Thank you, Joe &amp; Dough and Burpple, for the SG50 tasting last night! Go for the Bandung Cafe Latte and Soy Sauce Chicken &amp; Achar Sandwich, available from 1-31 August 2015.
\'Cha\', literally \'tea\' in Chinese. Oh boy, this was one Cha I couldn\'t get enough of. It had the perfect amount of sweetness contained in a cup, but so light and refreshing at the same time. Need a weapon to defeat the sweltering weather? This one here is quite a good bet. 
Spread the egg mayo across the toast and bite into it with the truffle aroma welcoming you! I liked the surprising bursts of lumpfish roe which definitely elevated the dish. 
Coffee is one thing I think I\'ll never learn how to appreciate, sigh. (Tea for me please!) So grab a cup of their signature coffee to taste it for yourself! 
One of the 3 SG50 specials is this gourmet sandwich. The crunchy vegetables marinated to a sour finish is strangely addictive to have continuous bites of the sandwich! It is a refreshing component which prevents the sandwich from getting too dry too! Available from 1 Aug - 31 Aug 2015. 
Why of course, who can forget to have a durian dessert especially during this time of the year! Different from other durian desserts like durian puffs which hold a thicker pur√©e, this filling was light, smooth and not too sweet. Quite a favourite amongst us! 
Found the cake a little dry and a bit too much coconut for my liking but the Gula Melaka gave it a nicer texture overall.  Topped with little Onde-Ondes lookalike which are actually white chocolate. Not really my kind of dessert but an interesting fusion! 
Cake has a very strong chocolate taste but a little on the dry side. However, the coconut shavings and gula melaka centre makes it all okay. Love the addition of the three cute onde onde. 
My favourite dessert of the night! The choux pastry didn\'t taste like it was sitting in the display for weeks. Durian custard was smooth and sweet. Felt so satisfied when I burp durian after that. 
Interesting twist with mango chutney to provide a sweetness to the mundane turkey ham. Doesn\'t get too sickening as with some sweet salad dressings. The olives embedded in the bread added a refreshing dimension to the sandwich. 
Now you can have breakfast at any time of the day! This truffle egg mayo toast is available all day at Joe &amp; Dough. Egg mayo is a comfort food that most of us grew up eating, and they elevated it with the addition of truffles! 
Ultimate morning comfort food can be found at Joe &amp; Dough now! A bowl of granola yoghurt bowl can start your day right as it\'s not too heavy on the palate and the addition of chia seeds allows you to reap health benefits too. Wished there was more honey to the otherwise slightly plain yoghurt for me! 
Served like a cappuccino but with lesser foam, the double ristretto signature joe maintains a good strength from the coffee beans and was smooth on the throat. Thank you Burpple and Joe &amp; Dough for the invite! Now I know where I can grab my cuppa joe on tiring work days (: 
Light truffle fragrance helped elevate the rather limp egg mayo. Goes well with the toast with fancy lumpfish roe to top it off. 
It\'s always greek yoghurt over flavoured yoghurts for me, so this might be the best breakfast option! Healthy chia seeds, granola and raisins gave the whole dish a nice crunch and hint of sweetness. The last drizzle of honey added a nice touch to the sour yoghurt. 
This doesn\'t stray too far from what I eat every morning. Greek yogurt with granola topped with raisins and chia seeds. I like how it stays true to the sourness, with no sweetness overload. The crunchy granola and raisins provided a mild sweetness that balanced the sourness, making it a rejuvenating breakfast or even as a refreshing snack.
Can\'t resist a cup of hot chocolate with marshmallows! The hot chocolate leans more towards the milky side, with lots of marshmallows to up the sweetness (and shiokness). 
Here\'s a slice of [CHOCOLATE TRIO S$6.50] to wish you a good Thursday morning! May your day be as sweet as this! 
Choose either chocolate/ raisin cinnamon, which are both very flavourful!

Such a pretty layered cake! My favorite, however, is the Zesty Orange Tea Cake ($4.20)!
The sandwiches here are yummy! üëç

üòºSpicy Surimi Crab Sandwich--heaps of shredded crab smothered in light mayo btw two slices of warm, fluffy sesame brioches. Not much of the spicy kick, but the tangy mayo juices kept us working through to the final crumb. üçíLikewise for the Turkey Ham with creamy Brie Cheese and sweet cranberries in crusty cheese baguette, too bad the turkey one is only for üéÑ
Made with 56% Belgian chocolate, chocolate ganache and raspberry puree, this decadent dessert ($5.80 per cake) is part of J&amp;D special Halloween menu. You can get this treat at all outlets, that include their sixth outlet at Kallang Leisure Park.
Fragrant gula Melaka topped Pandan cake is a wonderful mix of flavor. But the cake crumbles easily n can be a mess to eat. Perhaps better if it\'s a bit more moist. Costs $4.90 per slice, it\'s a nice pairing with my teddy-bear froth latte:)
The passionfruit element was extremely intense, so I suppose the sweetness of the peach was meant to counteract that. Personally though, I found both a little too overwhelming. If you are the sort who welcome in-your-face flavours, then this dessert might suit you well. 
Was tempted to try the surimi crab sandwich but was apprehensive when I learnt that there is mayo(I don\'t like the taste). They actually let me test the crab filling! So in the end I chose this bacon mushroom sandwich instead. Love the fluffy soft bread with slightly crunchy exterior. The mushroom was juicy and the bacon wasn\'t fatty and salty! It was  nice! You don\'t feel greasy and sinful after eating it! Love it! And I must love the great service too :) such a way to end the work week!
Found another goody for my breakfast. Sure, it\'s practically invisible alongside the heftier, more colourful and exciting-sounding sandwiches on display but at $4, this is the cheapest. Plus it tastes damn good.\n<br />After being warmed up, the croissant looks a little deflated but its butteriness is brought strongly to the fore (which is way more important!) The Emmenthal cheese has become all gooey, glueing the ham and croissant into a gratifying yumminess.
Yes!! Joe &amp; Dough has opened up a branch at Kallang Leisure Park. Now it\'s more convenient for me to stuff my face with this hearty warm sandwich for breakfast or lunch whenever I feel like it. The way the slice of back bacon, roasted mushrooms, saut√©ed onions, Swiss Emmenthal cheese and soft Swiss butter zopf bread all come together is hugely satisfying.
Joe &amp; Dough\'s Brewing Principles: they use the best quality beans that they ground only upon order. Each cup is pulled with skill and care to ensure the coffee tastes the best it possibly can. I wasn\'t disappointed - my latte was really quite lovely.
This came in a set. The cake was warm and fluffy. Wonderful pandan fragrance. And the sweet gula Melaka was sublime. Coconut shavings further enhanced the taste. Such a sweet and delicious cake. I usually don\'t like sweet stuff but I like this one. Americano was ok only. \n<br />Lovely quiet place with lots of sofa seats. Most people were on their laptops so no noise pollution. I adore this place.

Last I heard, there were limited bottles left!! Cranberry pineapple tarts are THEE BEST!
- Gula Melaka Pandan Cake - Pineapple Tart\n<br />- Citrus Butter Cookies
The espresso cheesecake looks good on the outside with its vibrant layering but the taste was very plain.
Some days.
YAY. Go eat them while it lasts and hope they keep it on the menu forever!

And I forgot what I wanted to say, but guys, HAVE THE ACHAR SANDWICH THINGY before it goes away after the end of August!

Featuring espresso chocolate cheesecake lemon lime cupcake and mixed berries cupcake. Cupcakes were quite dry, not the kind that I like, having a liquid centre which was too little too late. The stiff whip cream didn\'t make it anymore moist either. The cheesecake is super rich and dense with an Oreo crust. 
The chicken tikka sandwich was good - sufficiently spicy with a full on spice profile. Went really well with the mayonnaise and lettuce to provide a well balanced sandwich. The boneless chunks of chicken were also reasonably tender and moist. Wasn\'t such a fan of the soy sauce chicken with achar (SG50 special) as I didn\'t find the sourness compatible with the bread.
