Pleasant dinner at this cafe in bishan park. Food was good, service very prompt. Portions however were not substantial enough (or maybe I was just too tired and hungry after a hot day in the sun) but well there\'s always spicy nuggets at the macs nearby if you\'re still feeling hungry 🙊
still remember this was one of de the first place to serve this and dish and where all de brunch culture took off.
but if you\'re a french toast fan, this one is for you! \n<br />topped with haggan daz vanilla, some raspberries, every bite oozes that fragrant cinnamon flavour. if I could critic, the interior can be more fluffy and soaked with buttermilk.
Rather generous chunks of lobster and sauce as well. Quite a delicious dish altogether :) 
yummy! Ice cream complemented the sweetness of the crumble well, and there were cookie crumbs and berries as a tasteful surprise to go along 🍓🍪
😎 Egg Benedict here is worth a shout imo.
Beef Burger made to perfection. You are able to choose how you want the beef to be cook. I always like my steak or beef cook Medium. This burger is a must try when you are dining there.
Decent food with cosy outdoor seats that caters to dogs and their owners :)
Could have used a little more time in the pot but good flavour!
One of the best egg Benedict I had. English muffin was well toasted. Hollandaise sauce was really rich. Poached egg was runny &amp; good 👍
Average price. Food us nice and nice environment to relax on a weekend!
Great place for breakfast and brunch p.s. It\'s a animal-friendly cafe 🐥🐛🐝🐜🐞🐌🐩🐾
The sticky date pudding $13 is yummy! The salads they sold are quite good. Tried smoked duck salad $13 &amp; prawn salad $13. Main course $19-23 was ok. Lol..fresh apple juice $7 is not really nice.
@ $6 with maple syrup/ $9 with a scoop of ice cream think McDonald Hotcakes thicker, less moist and upsized x5. Would definitely satisfy someone craving for a pancake fix.\n
Quick brunch with the girlfriends at Canopy. Here\'s egg benedict, pancake and smoked duck salad! @beatricesays @velouriadreams @melleser
We could ate a cow after the session haha! 😁😁😁 Great embience for dinner date, food wise average, service was prompt &amp; staff were friendly... #throwback #igdaily #sgig #igsg #brunch #ladiesday #girlsdate #latergram #foodie #food #foodreview #canopygardendining #angmokio #bishanpark2 #burpple #burpplesg #foodporn #cafe #cafesg #cafehop #sgcafe #sgfoodie #sgfood

Buttery and yummy hollandaise sauce. 
#Service was a bit #slow, and our #order was #billed #wrongly, though the #food was not bad. The #pork #rack was #tender and #juicy, but could have been more #flavourful. #mashedpotatoes  #canopygardendining #burpple #dinner #meat
Love the crisp Serrano ham and generous serving of their signature hollandaise sauce (: #eggsben #eggsbenedict #hollandaise #brunch #canopy #bishan #park #cafe #sgcafe #weekends #instafood #burpple

It\'s been a while since my last visit (before the reno), but must say that both food and ambiance has improved since.
Breakfast in this beautiful glass house brighten up my day ☺️
Yumyum...love the huge #pancake from #bishanpark #canopy. The price is on the steeper side considering it\'s only one pancake though. \n<br />#foodreviewssg #foodreviewsasia #foodpornsg
Nice brekkie in the park!

Yummy Pad Thai - totally delicious 
With Orange sauce .... So yummy 
This was averagish ... didn\'t stand out much 
Love the brunch quality here, egg Benedict was really good. Big breakfast was a spread and well presented. And lastly not the overpriced breakfast kind 👍   
Nice ambience, close to nature, great!
