Loved this because the consistency and thickness was just right - not too thick and medicinal-tasting, not too watered down. Not really an almond cream person but they\'ve really converted me
These weren\'t at all \"xiao\". They came in pretty hefty bite sizes so that kept us quiet for a while
Aww cute. And delicious too
Obviously too thrilled about this, my hand was shaking with excitement
My very first \'Lo Hei\' experience!! Toss to a year of abundance and wealthy with this flourishing yusheng ‚Äì  with a lavish spread of fresh lobster, Alaskan crab, Hokkaido scallops, Norwegian salmon, Salmon roe and Japanese kelp.http://missneverfull.com/?p=3710
Inaniwa udon in superior broth. With a dollop of truffle sauce and poached lobster that\'s all. üòú Stellar dishes as usual. And thanks Chef for being so patient with my questions. üòÅ

I shall try their dim sum buffet next time. Love the embrace at Êµ∑Â§©Ê•º. Very decently priced even if it\'s a hotel restaurant \n<br />#dimsum #cantonese #panpacificsingapore #promenade #cityhall #burpplesg #burpple

Her face beamed as she ate salty food. Hahaha.... it\'s really very tasty!
They\'ve also just revamped their Dim Sum menu - diners can look forward to scrumptious Pork Belly Buns from a new \'live\' station.
