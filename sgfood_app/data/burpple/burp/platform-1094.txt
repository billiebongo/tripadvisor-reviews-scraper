This carrot and beetroot soup was so flavourful-the colour was very pretty as well. It was a thin soup and served with a slice of homemade bread and sour cream (?Not sure what it is as it tasted sourish like yogurt) on the side. Unique flavours that blended well and made it a refreshing, light choice. (They served it in a cauldron-style pot to make it extra wicked)
This time at a Harry Potter theme café, learning to create food using magic.. Food tasted magically delicious.. Haha.. Didn\'t get to try their \"magically instagrammable\" dessert as it is available after 3 pm.. 😒 \n<br />#platform1094 #carrotandbeetrootsoup #schnitzelsousvideduckbreast #crabmeataglioolio #rainbowcake #burpple #cannotstopeating #brunch #abituluplace #jaslynfoodinstagram

One side is the Hoegaarden Rose mousse topped with berry foam representing beauty while the other has honey caviar nestled on yogurt parfait symbolizing youth and exuberance.\n<br />The macaron wand slowly disintegrates leaving behind remnants of compressed plum, chocolate soil as well as assorted berries.\n<br />Many years later, wild purple and white floral hues begin to bloom.. #instafood #eatoutsg #sgfood #burpplesg #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #onthetable #igfoodies #foodcoma #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #foodphotography #foodspotting #foodlover #burpple #foodlovers #igfood #hungrygowhere #whati8today

It is definitely a stunning display. #burpple #tingzieeats
(think harry potter)\n<br />Established by the folks behind Fresh Fruits Lab, you can expect an aesthetic display of drinks. No better way to present a cocktail in a wizard themed cafe by naming it [Goblet of fire, $15].\n<br />_\n<br />This blue enchanting concoction contains curacao liqueur, lemonade, barcadi rum. The latter when ignited with fire and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, creates magical sparks that makes every diner entertained.
Do check them out haha
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the drink and witness magical gold sparks unleashed before you.
A sister cafe of Fruit Lab in Changi. Platform1094 offers items such as pasta, big breakfasts etc. This cafe has a \"widzary\" theme. Warm and cozy with brown brick wall on one side and natural lighting from the other side.\n<br />🔸🔹\n<br />The crab meat aglio olio is one of their signatures garnished with smoked salmon and flying fish roe. The giant breakfast comprises of sausages, scramnled eggs, bacon wrapped pineapple, pumpkins, tomatoes and salad. Coffee origin is their own blend of Brazil, Ethiopian and Indonesian.\n<br />🔸🔹\n<br />Generous portions of each dish and can easily be shared by 2. Prices are reasonable averaging at $15 depending on what you order. It looks like a cafe which is suitable for slightly bigger groups or families with small kids.
To understand what\'s going on in this incendiary display, observe the shadows on the wall and the table space around the glass.
