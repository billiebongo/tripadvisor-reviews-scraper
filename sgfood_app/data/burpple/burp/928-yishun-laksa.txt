Don\'t expect fancy ingredients like prawns. As simple as fishcake slices, crabsticks and cockles. It\'s a good bowl of laksa. Flavourful. The chili, I like.
After more than 10 years, this stall called 928 Laksa is still super popular. Although the price for a bowl of laksa has grown over the years from $1.50 (Mom recalled it) to the current $2.80, long queue is still normal. Just this morning when I walked past the stall at 9am, there were already people queuing outside waiting for the stall to open. It opened during my secondary school days. I still remember one of the things which we like to do after school is to have laksa followed by dessert at the dessert stall. Both used to be located at the same shop unit. But as the business of the laksa stall grew bigger, the stall decided to move to the next door unit which is its current location. It remains popular with the residents even today. The laksa is simple with sliced fish cake, bean curd puff, blood cockles, bean sprouts, crab stick, hard boiled egg, chopped laksa leaves, chilli paste on thick rice noodles. The gravy is rich with finely minced dried shrimp at the bottom, which most would finish all.\n<br />It is located at blk 928 Yishun Central 1, # 01-155 (next to Lit Lit Dessert ), Singapore 760928. #Hawkerpedia

Still maintaining the standard even after so many years. üëç
One of the best laksa in Singapore, imo.
