House mashed sweet potato, plated with plump scallops and shrimp that have a smoky, savoury sweet flavour. Paired with a fresh garden salad. Listed as an appetizer on the menu, but can easily be a main course as well. Worth ordering!
Love it when you can choose your preferred preparation style, like char-grilled, battered etc! \n<br />If you are unsure, you can ask the staff for advice! Look at this pretty plate, with firm and flaky meat and no fishy aftertaste üòç
This is one of the most well-kept secrets by our editor, until now. It\'s mainly seafood and oysters at Greenwood Fish Market and Bistro, but they offer a seriously great burger ‚Äî the Angus Burger ($21.95). This masterpiece contains a really, really juicy, freshly minced Angus beef patty that fares best when done medium, portobello mushroom, a thick slice of sweet tomato and tangy gherkin. Despite all the wonderful flavours and textures, the beef really shines. The setting here is perfect for a date, but only come when you and your beau are truly comfortable with each other ‚Äî you\'ll want to get your hands and face dirty for this burger. For a better balanced meal, order their foolproof Fish and Chips ($19.95) alongside the burger and share! A glass of wine or cold beer goes splendidly with this meal. \n<br />Photo by Burppler Jayne Tan
Enjoy over 20 different varieties of fresh oysters throughout the whole month of July 2016!
Crisp, non-oily batter, fresh john dory fillet within. Piping hot medium-cut chips and fresh salad. Chili was, oddly enough, slightly salty.
For the whole of July 2016, feast on over 20 varieties of fresh oysters! AMEX card holders enjoy 50% off the 2nd Dozen oysters! T&amp;C applies.
Loaded with a really juicy portobello mushroom, refreshing tangy gherkins and sweet caramelized onions, this angus beef patty still managed to shine. What I loved about this burger was that you could taste every single component, leaving a proper burger experience that never distracted from the beef. This patty fared better when we ordered it Medium over Medium Rare. Great brioche buns that held everything well and never got soggy. One of my better burger experiences! Make sure to get this and share a fish &amp; chips with your dining partner. Wash it down with cold beer or a glass of wine. This place was really enjoyable - nice enough for a date, casual enough for dinner out with friends or family. 
Love the smoked tomato soup here! It is not overly tangy and the smokiness makes it so memorable...
Fresh and sweet clams in white wine garlic sauce! Thumbs up!
no matter what I was craving for, it was all satisfied when these treats were served on our table.
fresh succulent and juicy gem of the ocean will be available here for 5 weeks. a yearly affair for me, but first time for a tasting. thanks for bringing me üòÅ @fundamentally_flawed
FISH STEAK THAT IS. Thick, charred but still so moist and flaky. This joint have been my favorite place to go for good fresh seafood, and more. The portion is big, and a huge blop of perfectly mashed with butter and milk potatoes, and a even tossed salad on the side. Was so stuff, and I am upset that I couldn\'t have more. Urgh! üòÇ in a good way. 
(@19.95$++) thick slabs of smoked salmon in between buttered sesame bun w greens side and fries.. Taste and quality guaranteed 
This was some solid fillet - juicy, meaty and perfectly seasoned. Oh, and the mash was no sidekick, too. 
I wanted calamari and fish &amp; chips, so we had the seafood basket that had all the fried goodies :) came with mussels and fried prawns too. Their batter is really one of the best. Seafood and white wine for a mid week break! 
New Zealand oysters going at $1.50 on the eve of public holiday! Sweeeet! 
Was told that it\'s their seasonal fish.. Bill shown baked trobut. Which we still didn\'t figure out what fish is that... Whahah ... The spices is nice..and for those who love fish eggs. This must be order.. Almost half of the fish is the egg... Meat is fine.. Smooth... And did I mention? This fish cost us $180 and waiting time is like 1 hour... 
seared fish. cheese baked oysters. grilled squid. fried prawns. mussels in white wine. awesome fries. need I say more?
A touch of champagne adds a refreshing bittersweetness to the rich cream sauce, which smothers al dente linguine and a welcome overdose of succulent prawns, squid and scallops. 
Pink snapper for me and John dory for him. ‚ô° happy friday dinner date! @tribalzoid
pan seared salmon with mashed pumpkin n vegetables. $24.90++ verdict: 7.5/10, not bad, love the dressings on the veg, mashed pumpkin r sweet, something diff frm typical mashed potato. fish wise, typical tasting salmon.
Had Greenwood fish market yesterday... they really need to up their checks before they prepare food
Boasting a natural sweetness that will titillate your palate, the likes of grilled zucchini, eggplant, broccoli and herbed cherry tomatoes atop a heap of fluffy mash provides the fitting finale.\n<br />.\n<br />üè£34/38 Greenwood Avenue Singapore 289236\n<br />.\n<br />üïöOpening Hours: \n<br />Daily: 11.00 am - 10.30 pm\n<br />.\n<br />üí≤Damage: $32.95\n<br />.\n<br />#instafood #igfood #sgfood #instasg #igsg #sgig #sgcafes #sgcafe #singaporefood #sgfoodlover #cafehoppingsg #sgrestaurant #foodstagram #food #igfoodies #foodgram #foodiesg #igfoodie #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #vscofeed #foodlover #foodlovers #igfood #stfoodtrending #exploresingapore #singapore #singaporefoodie #burpple #burpplesg

With 20 type of oysters to choose from, it is definitely not to be miss.\n<br />.\n<br />Chubby Botak Koala tried 15 type of oysters during the visit. Gillardeau No.3 is a must try. It is meaty, tender and crunchy; while the flavour is balance between sweet and salty with a nutty aroma.\n<br />.\n<br />Check out the full review at chubbybotakkoala.com or at the link in my profile page.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #sgrestaurant #burpple #greenwoodfishmarket #worldoysterfestival2016 #oystersg #oysters #sgfoodporn #sgfoodblogger #hungrygowhere #instafood_sg #instafoodsg #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgfestival

Char grilled barramundi with really good buttery and creamy mashed potatoes. The soft shell crab salad was equally amazing. We were surprised with the spiciness of the salad, probably from the dressing, but the flavour was well paired. Thank you dear for dinner. \n<br />#barramundi #seafood #softshellcrab #eatoutsg #sgfoodies #burpple #greenwoodfishmarket #datenight

A tad meaty, some fats and yes, that aroma of apple wood.
#toogood || Come by for their Oyster Festival happening until the 25th JulyÔºÅ
All eyes on the room had drifted to its beguiling presence. || My favorites from the platter include the scrambled egg and smoked mackerel as well as the scrumptious shreds of pulled pork. Note that all these are available as individual portions for now BUT my eyes are set on that devilish sounding {PULLED PORK SANDWICH} üòçüòçüòç Who\'s with meÔºü

Imbued heavily with smoked apple wood chips, this was an explosion of flavors on the palate with an amalgamation of streaky smoke infused fats and sous-vide tender meat„ÄÇ
