#SGfuture #2amDesserts #2amDessertbar #JaniceWong2am\n<br />⋅\n<br />Still craving to go back for The Nivasco Brachetto D\'asti. 🍷@christinelyh we\'re due back here soon. 😁
Thanks to Janice Wong &amp; team for having us at 2am:dessertbar this afternoon and talking us through food innovation whilst serving up treats as we hid from the rain outside.
Do we continue on this path of environment degradation or do we find ways to exist harmoniously with nature? Great sharing my Chef Janice Wong @2amdessertbar, as part of the #SGfuture initiative. Lots to chew on.
What\'s the future of food? \n<br />Here at @2amdessertbar to listen to @thefutureofus.sg \n<br />Hopefully we won\'t be just popping pills to phil us up.
Now that you\'ve had your tummies filled and warmed, hop 10 steps across the lane to 2am Dessert Bar for a sweet treat. As its name suggests, it opens till 2am, allowing you and your friends to chat the night away. The space is nothing like you\'d expect for a dessert bar — its long concrete counters and high chairs provide a dark, cool, industrial vibe. Chef Janice Wong has long been combining unique flavours, and employing interesting techniques to create desserts like we\'ve never seen before. Think tofu parfait, hojicha custard, and pear vodka sorbet lovingly put together in the Hojicha Sesame ($18); or the beautiful Tsujirihei Green Tea Tart ($20) that will have you weak at the knees with its crisp tart shell giving way to an oozing, warm green tea filling, and made complete with a jasmine rice sherbet. Prices aren\'t cheap, but it is worth the experience, so be sure to share a couple of desserts!
Cassis bombe, elderflower yoghurt foam, plum liquor, bamboo shoot. Good for people who wants to have dessert but not so much of a sweet tooth 😊😊
Definitely not something I will try again. The hojicha was really bitter. And the lychee sorbet was rather tasteless. The tofu parfait was interesting but did not have much taste to it. 2/5
Interesting dessert. Nice chocolate cake but the nut butter needed more salt!! The ice cream was also so so 3.5/5
Green apple bomb, basil foam, herb granita, sea grapes - $23 The use of herbs and basil in a dessert was initially rather weird/foreign but this taste grows on you after awhile. Would only recommend if you\'re a fan of herbs as the flavour is quite strong
Energetic, spicy and full of spunk. Yet besides all that attitude she\'s pretty green and down to earth. \n<br />The experience is fascinating! the slightly tart apple against the herb granita and basil foam creates a slight savory aftertaste that lingers. \n<br />Monster has struck gold indeed. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #instasgSunday10pm #instasgSundayGoldenHour
Truffle infinity, cheese cake &amp; plaisir passito bianco. These 3 tasty dessert for the nights is just what you need in your mouth. It\'s the nice n the ambience in the bar is just great. 😎 Slightly expensive but worth to try it out😁
Interesting flavour of sherbet and loved the overflowing warm green tea filling that oozed out when I cut the tart. \n<br />On a down side, the sherbet melted too quickly.
3 out of 3: Freshly made churros with three different sauces.\n<br />~ Dark chocolate salted caramel\n<br />~ Milk chocolate tonka\n<br />~ White chocolate lavendar
2 out of 3: Chocolate Praline Poprock Cakes and the other cake (sorry I forgot your name 😅) which was specially baked for us! 💕
1 out of 3: Marvelously tasty roasted chicken cheese tacos melts with mini beef burger and champagne! Thank you to the newly weds, Cheryl and Qing An for the treat ✌️
I have absolute love for all things green tea and this is a must order! Dish had the right balance of sweetness to brings out the flavour of Warm oozy green tea filling 
Tsujirihei green tea tart is an art piece by itself, against the painted table. love the overflowing warm green tea filling. very attractive presentation on the plate. price is on the steeper side though. desserts were prepared openly at the bar counter
Missing these amazing creations by Janice Wong of 2am. In this cosmopolitan city where high fashion couture and la nouvelle cuisine are strangers to none, it\'s nice to see the avant-garde take on the humblest éclair. My faves are her Mont-blanc and Chocolate.
A must try @ 2am dessert bar. Great ambience. Good food, good company, good time. #burpple\n<br />Photo credits: @joeyluvjolin
Just can\'t get enough of Janice Wong\'s éclairs! They\'re not only so damn pretty to look at, they taste mindblowingly awesome too. Mango lovers would adore this Mango and Matcha one.
Happy like bird cause there\'s a new place I can get superb éclairs from!! Janice Wong of 2am dessert bar\'s started a pop-up last December, that focuses on éclairs and unique edible art. Pictured here\'s the lovely Tiramisu. Love the choux pastry.
Probably one of the most amazeballs tarts I\'ve had so far, 2am Dessert Bar\'s green tea tart is full of powdery oozy matcha goodness. Together with the crisp tart, it made the matcha lover in me cry with bliss 😜
Haven\'t been to 2am Dessert Bar in such a long time! The tiramisu wasn\'t my favourite, but decent all the same. Loved the espresso ice cream🍦 
Like a United Colours of Benetton concept in their bringing together of distinctly different-tasting (and contrastingly-coloured) elements. It\'s a grassy/caramel/bitter chocolate ménage a trois that somehow works when you do a vertical fork-dive, yet the individual elements also taste reasonably good on their own. 3.7/5
All three were so good we couldn\'t decide which one was the best.
A pleasurable simulation of savoury dining as a wild boar, with the indulgent combination of crispy crunch and truffley mushiness likely to inspire a few satisfied grunts. 3.6/5
Nothing could ever describe my love for waffles . Waffles here are magical 😍 with popping candies and delicious sorbet topped over the chocolate and strawberry waffles 
I could probably finish 10 of this at one shot if not for the price tag 😅😅
Yes it\'s definitely not grey. Pistachio sponge, coco mousse and pandan gula Melaka custard. Two thumbs up! For both presentation and taste! #latergram
Bought it from Janice wong\'s pop up shop at ion orchard. Bought one of every flavour to try. I didn\'t like is the lemon one,it taste just like concentrated flavoured sugar in a chocolate shell.
Purple potato purée, blackcurrant parfait, leather, lavender marshmallow and fruits of the forest sorbet. Great presentation!

We ordered Pandan, Valrhona Chocolate and Coconut Marshmallow. Coconut Marshmallow is really unique, it has a very unique texture, not like the usual ice cream.
Easily the most nuanced and exciting of the three desserts I tried on my latest visit. There are flourishes like mushroom crumble, ginger gel and white chocolate ganache to ensure that you can experiment with a bajillion combinations of flavours and every mouthful is a startling revelation. Not as alcoholic as the Cassis Plum though. 4.25/5
Like the gorgeous girl that initially dazzles and has a promising start, but who eventually falters as you realise it\'s all make-up magic and she doesn\'t have the substance and personality underneath all that glacial beauty. Love that it\'s pretty alcoholic though! 3.5/5
Lonely Planet said many factors contributed to the win, including various developments including a new crop of swanky hotels, and a number of new attractions, such as the Singapore Sports Hub and the National Art Gallery opening next year. And so, we celebrate by having KAYA! 🙊🙊 Chef @janicewong2am of @2amdessertbar demonstrates a kaya dessert - pistachio cookie crumbs, pistachio cake, with coconut pandan kaya ice cream (all made from natural ingredients!). The combination is incredible, everything blends in perfectly! 👏👏 Plating by me💁
Chef Janice Wong pushes the boundaries of conventional desserts by creating tantalising sweets that look like edible works of art. True to its name, 2am dessertbar opens until 2am, seeking to satisfy your late night dessert cravings and desire for sweet, sinful indulgence. Located in the extremely happening Holland Village, this may be the perfect place for those birthday countdown celebrations, no?
This place is full of innovation I would say. Ordered a chili chocolate, and I didn\'t expect that the chocolate really turn out to be spicy. Without any hint of why is it spicy, all I can taste is the sweetness of the dessert yet it doesn\'t smell like chili but it is just spicy with no taste and smell of it. The churros was egg-y for me, and I didn\'t really like it. But it really gave me a big surprise when I ordered the chili chocolate. Didn\'t managed to try the other dessert but I think this place give surprise pretty well. 
There’s always time and room for desserts and nothing fits the bill more than this quaint restaurant with its variety of desserts and late closing hours.
A new positive experience on the tastebuds. Pandan ice cream is simply delicious, as with the rest of the food in my picture
Cheese cake atop smoked tofu soup and malt..tasty combination of flavors!
Chocolate was uber thick. \n<br />blood orange sorbet was uber not bad
Weird dessert. But trust me. It\'s super awesome. Kayambe h20 #burpple
Elegant. This cheese mousse is rich and dense. If you\'re into fine desserts, this is a definite Must Try.
Satisfy your midnight sweet cravings with this choc crumble that\'s really IS crumbled up. Smooth choc with crunchy bits on each bite. Generous portion and very filling coz of the rich ingredients.
Brie Gorgonzola cheesecake!!!
1 of our favourites amongst the creations of Janice Wong. The dark chocolate with Yuzu sorbet was a surprising good pairing.

Schedule has been too hectic. Work + school = 😲🔫
Could be better if the churros were abit more tough rather then soft , nevertheless the dark chocolate salted caramel sauce dip was good. 😁 \n<br />#Foodphotography #Sgfood

Unsweetened chocolate with large crispy Churros 
This is marshmallow painting. Yes soft and gooey. Just this big marshmallow can feed about 200 people. Is this the \"future of food\"?

I spent a lovely afternoon with the folks of #theFutureOfUs and @2amdessertbar exploring futuristic creations. Here\'s one delicious concoction of avocado, cassis and passionfruit. YUM. #foodporn #2amdessertbar #burpple
I especially liked how you solved the problem of a lack of plates by creating chocolate plates. It was a creative touch to a real world problem. Resourceful, yet sustainable. Perhaps we would be able to reduce waste, with edible cutlery and plates in the future. Looking forward to the culinary exploits of an innovative generation. \n<br />In frame: Hand painted Chocolate sphere with hidden treasures. \n<br />#SGfuture #janicewong2am #2amdessertbar #hungryhungrymonster

I must say its pretty steep for a small plate like this but I do know the source of ingredients are not cheap and of course you pay for the execution as well. #foodie #foodstagram #instafood #yuzuqueen #desserts #singapore #burpple
Honestly the best of the 3 desserts we tried.  The molten green tea oozed out of the crust and went really well with the understated rice sherbet.
Finally trying out 2AM : Dessert Bar after all these years. Honestly some hits and some misses.
@cheongkiat @kwongmh @tangsher #burpple
Janice wong\'s pop up shop at ion orchard. Weird but yes, they do sell mochi. The matcha mochi was good. Skin was thin but still has the slight chewy texture. The matcha fillings was not too sweet and balanced. If not for the service, I would probably get some fresh mochi every other day.

Oishiiiiiiiii!  #fuelbeforeexam #byebyediet
Sour reigned supreme, with surprising flashes of saltiness (!) and sweet in between. 4/5
Every single bite of this is heaven. The waitress recommended this to me and said it\'s the top 5 churros in singapore. She wasn\'t kidding when she said that. ($5+) 
quite diasppointing
Favourite place for relax and fun with friends. Should try the dessert. 
Whee. @thumberlinakoh #burpple
Best churros I\'ve tasted in singapore.
