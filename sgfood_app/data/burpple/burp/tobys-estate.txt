If you\'re planning to work over the long weekend, do so in style (with good company) at your neighbourhood cafe! 😉 WiFi + power sockets + caffeine + power fries = the way to go!! 🍟📱💻📧\n<br />(one can always work and enjoy life at the same time!! 😍)

$12 - salmon and bacon with enoki in a crisped batter! Batter was light. Kinda liked the varying textures in a mouthful and it was greasy just like how junk food should be 😛
Despite the sweltering weather, it is never too hot for a good Chai Latte ☕️ 
Ordered the roast beef sandwich and the Brooklyn eggs benedict. Both were good, though I personally felt that more slices of beef could be included in the sandwich. 
Typical brunch food (chose overeasy, comes with espresso bacon, fresh juicy tomatoes, mushrooms, baked beans, brioche and harissa sausage) but we thought it was well done - each item was tastily good on its own and while it costs $25, it was very substantial.
honestly rather average French toast but extremely good coffee! :-) amazing ambiance as well! perfect place to get some work done / read a book while sipping on a good cup of coffee
Lunch break with a pretty good Brooklyn style Eggs Ben (for $19 I wouldn\'t expect anything less than these runny poached eggs, tasty hollandaise and pretty generous amount of pulled beef) and an even better cup of Mocha.Frickin\'.Chai. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius who knows the way to my heart. 🤗 
Simply lovely. \n<br />_\n<br />#thefoodjournalist #tobysestatesg\n<br />_

A runny good start to the weekend! The eggs were perfectly poached, served on top of soft and fluffy brioche bread, with fresh smoked salmon. The dash of paprika added a nice touch to this dish! Loving the chillax vibes along the river too. 
A great place to chill by the riverside. Food was a hearty portion. Coffee, like mentioned by many, is smooth and well blended roast. Brooklyn Style Eggs Ben $19 Flat White $5
Thick slice of bread with tasty ham and egg. The salad which i love most. Sufficient taste and juicy.
Not a huge fan of sweet treats, so I think I\'ll still stick to my usual big breakfast plate 😉 The cold brew☕️ at the back was fantastic - one of the best I\'ve had. ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n<br />☞Free Wifi☜ 🚇Nearest Station: Clarke Quay, followed by a 15min walk along the river👣
Times like this are hard to come by.
First time trying Mocha Chai so I was unsure how it will taste like. My worries were unfounded as this combines my 2 favourites: Mocha and Chai Latte in a cup.
Had the pork burger, was good though the sauce was kinda spicy for me. Coffee was perfect! 🙌☕️👍
Prettily plated but rather underwhelming, would probably go for the coffee instead!

😍🍴 Granted, #tobysestatesg @ Rodyk Street may be not be the most convenient to get to; a tedious 15-minute walk from Clarke Quay Station under our scorching sun ☼ But I wouldn\'t mind patronizing them again because of the espresso bacon! And that toasted brioche! Need I really say more? Everything on that plate was on point. Breakfast of Champions may be more expensive than the regular café fare (it\'s $25), but I can totally see why it remains popular. 👍 ⭐️Star of this dish is, hands down, the bacon⭐️\n<br />••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n<br />👉Wifi Available👈 🚇Nearest Station: Clarke Quay, followed by a 15min walk👣 (just treat it as exercise for all the calories in your brunch, you guys)
Nothing like a comforting cup of coffee from Toby\'s, ever so predictable and reliable. Best place for brunch by the river, if only the weather were less sweltering. 
Their Pulled Pork Burger ($22) was not bad, a nice portion was served but it was nothing out of the world. Perhaps the pulled pork burger needed a longer simmer with the BBQ sauce for a richer taste instead of a drizzle before serving. Therefore, a tad dry texture on the protein. However,  it was compensated by the fibre from apple coleslaw, greens and the well toasted brioche buns. I preferred the fries that was deep fried and seasoned to perfection - not too greasy and tasty! Full review on http://imhaydenchan.blogspot.sg/2015/04/tobys-estate-singapore.html?m=1
It will be my top list for my caffeine fix in future~~
The pizza base is actually made of tortilla, and the toppings are simply chunks of mushrooms, grilled chicken strips, cheese, a basic tomato sauce and lots of leafy greens. It may not be outstanding, but its simplicity brought out a certain home-iness and that\'s what I liked about it. 
Ok, so it is a little bit expensive at $18, but it is surely one of the tastiest salads I\'ve had. The greens were really fresh and crunchy, and the grilled chicken thigh tender and flavorful. But the one standout ingredient that made it hard for me to stop? The oh-so-sweet and juicy cubes of mango!

Read a lot about it and finally came here. Was a little disappointed with the food. Coffee was alright. Have to pay extra for the hollandaise sauce which is not that fantastic. The vine tomato just make the meal slight more complete.  
Heavenly combo of sweet and savory. Absolutely divine. The French toast were soft with the right moisture, each mouthful with light sourness from the mixed berries compote. The bacon was a bonus with the right crispness. At $16 per portion (if remembered correctly). Had this as my lunch! Sinful. 
The 150g beef patty was substantial and nicely seasoned. Paired with the beautifully caramelized onions and beetroot (in unique Australian fashion), this burger could do with more savoury ingredients like a stronger cheese to balance out the sweetness. The brioche buns and side of fries were delicious, as usual.
Tender pulled pork soaked in a delicious smoky BBQ sauce, and a creamy refreshing coleslaw sandwiched between crisp, fluffy toasted brioche buns. The sweet, tangy flavours were really satisfying, and this is my favourite pulled pork burger to date! ☺️ The side of fries was good too.
If you\'ve been following me, you would know that I uses it alot which offers many one for one main course. 2015 app is out, have you got yours yet? ☺️
This cafe serves food not too over the top but the last I recalled, the service they provided was excellent. Pretty nice ambience too. The last I checked, the waffle item that I ordered seems to be taken off their menu but their Toby\'s French Toast ($14) was pretty amazing! The black cuppa just gives off this \"I know my coffee\" vibe. Kidding.
Oh my runy eggs! Prices and reviews on my blog http://missneverfull.com/?p=2291 
Pulled pork burger / French toast / croissant with salmon and scrambled eggs. 
Good coffee beans but it\'s slightly too bitter to my liking.
Using #entertainerapp once again, 1-for-1 mains 🍳 @the_entertainer241
Coffee was good but it\'s a little bitter for my liking. Thanks to the #entertainerapp, we\'re entitled to 1-for-1 mains. Breakfast champion ($25) which I find it a rip-off. Brooklyn egg Benedict ($19) on the other hand was really good. With the home made Hollandaise sauce 👍
A beloved institution of river-side coffee and brunch, don\'t miss Toby\'s at Cafe Fest. These good people are committed to spreading their love for and the importance of good coffee by ensuring you get a taste of their gibraltar latte and espresso available at the Fest. Make sure you drop by and say hi!
There was a very strong spice flavour... tasted like it was cooked chinese style. Will not order again. Fries were just ok..
One of my favorite cafe spot on a weekend morning. Grab a book or my iPad (free wifi available) and watch people jogging, cycling and family having leisure walk with their pets or toddlers. I prefer seated at the alfresco area, where I can feel the warmth of the morning sun while sipping this balanced cup of coffee.
was disappointed with the food after all the highly-raved reviews. Coffee is not bad though. 
Green apple (😑), horrible strawberries, raspberries and blueberries, average tasting French toast with slight sweetness.. I really love the sausage (add-on) and bacon.. Service was absolutely horrible.. 
Toby\'s Estate does a respectable version of the perennial brunch favourite. I particularly liked the zesty tomato salsa  that came with it, if only there was more. At $22, it is a bit pricey relative to the serving.Verdict - come for the coffee and grab lunch elsewhere!
We called this The Manly Breakfast. It has so much protein! This is like a non-tomatoey version of shashouka/ the Tunisian from Wild Honey. It came with 2 eggs, fully cooked (would have preferred the eggs to be runny though!), a Harrison sausage, portobello mushrooms and looooooaaaddddssss of minced beef. The whole pan was filled with beef, really. This was well worth the $18! One thing to note though - this requires baking so it takes a longer time to prepare. Try not to order this if you are famished!
I was very happy with Toby\'s French toast ($14.90)! :D The French toast was made with thick slices of brioche, which is mildly sweet and complemented the salty bacon very well. The egg didn\'t permeate the entire slice, but this didn\'t compromise on the eggy flavour of the toast and instead, yielded a crisp French toast that still had a light, pillowy center. The maple glazed bacon was awesome. Sweet and salty, this was a smokier, saltier version of everyone\'s cny favourite, bak kwa. The dish also came with some of my favourite fruits - berries and apples! I loved how this dish was hearty, and not oily at all. Yum!
In addition to our own mains, bf and I picked a simple breakfast set of scrambled eggs on toast brioche ($8.50) to share. You have a choice of scrambled eggs or poached eggs, and brioche, croissant or (I think) sourdough. I initially doubted the quality of food at Toby\'s because of some food reviews I had read, but I\'m so glad we tried it for ourselves! The eggs came steaming hot (I always appreciate freshly cooked food) but still creamy and not overcooked. Eggs were also seasoned just right, unlike some scrambled eggs that taste bland. The chopped chives or spring onions (?) added freshness and an Asian touch to this dish (which you may or may not like - for me, it was ok!). This was a great start to our fantastic time at Toby\'s!
Coffee on a rainy Sunday 
The serving was so so so generous and it was totally worth the money! Love everything on the plate - their homemade baked beans, sauteed portobello mushrooms, roasted cherry vine tomatoes, maple espresso bacon, harissa sausage, toasted brioche and scrambled eggs! Everything tasted so delish! ^^
The paprika powder was a nice touch to this dish! Generous serving of brioche and smoked salmon. The hollandaise sauce was not too much and not too heavy, hence making this dish less sinful for us! :P
Haven\'t been back at Toby\'s after the facelift x Does it almost feels like nothing changed. What matters most is that the food and coffee are still as good as before!
Not all salads are meant to be toss-ups; often, with a bit of ingenuity in the mix and green fingers, they can be dressed for success. This beets and arugula number at Toby\'s Estate is what happens when a plate is planted with strokes of genius: delicately wilted arugula, lightly seared beets, milky cubes of feta, almond slivers, and caramelized onions that shine like dandelions in a Van Gogh landscape. Everything is anointed with a stardust of paprika. Toby\'s Estate is a great space - it may be a Sydney institution, but the long communal table centerpiecing bare concrete walls and exposed brick is all Melbourne, lit up with plenty of sunshine from floor-to-ceiling windows. Or is that actually daylight robbery? Because even this beauty is challenging to justify at $18 - make sure you sit on the north side of that table so you at least get the Singapore River views of the cafe\'s prime location for this tab.
On a side note, Toby\'s only available for take out coffee at their alfresco seating. Due to their kitchen expansion, the indoor seating will be closed till mid April.
Head over to this institution in Robertson Quay and get yourself a nice seat at the communal table. Begin the day by choosing from their wide variety of excellent coffees and teas, and fill your tummy with a skillet of Moroccan baked eggs.
Ordered this for brunch cause I couldn\'t decide what I really want! Meal usually just comes with a choice of brioche, sourdough or Crossiant &amp; either poached or scrambled eggs! &amp; today didn\'t feel like a poached eggs day, so I settled for scrambled. Bacon &amp; mushrooms were additional add-ones for 4$ &amp; 3$ respectively! 
...kinda feeling under the weather. does coffee act as a remedy?
First time here so I opted for the crowd favourite. Well seasoned and balanced dish. Wish there could have been a small serving of fresh greens to go with the bacon but overall, very tasty. Love the communal table that allows me to be with people and by myself at the same time. Will definitely come again. 
A shot of espresso poured over a scoop of vanilla gelato with coffee beans for the crunchy bite. It\'s enjoyable anytime of a day, where dessert and coffee are combined into a single delectable treat. 
A cupful of vanilla ice cream flecked with whole coffee beans, and mild bitter espresso with the right mix of bitter and sweet. I like this pairing; especially the crunchy coffee beans when I eat it with the ice cream. 
Cafe Mocha with a coffee art that seems too abstract for my understanding. A deformed swan maybe? Haha but nonetheless, the coffee is still great. Full-bodied with the distinct chocolate taste. I bet they don\'t use those typical chocolate syrup. Love it. $5.80
Sunday Brunch at one of favorite cafes. Eggs Royale poached barn laid eggs, smoked salmon on brioche + toby’s espresso hollandaise sauce – $16\n<br />Love how the runny egg yolk got soaked into the soft brioche. Great taste on the smoked salmon, not too salty (luckily) and not forgetting the EGG Benedict... Awesomely. But I\'m wondering why is there no greens... It\'s supposed to have. Anyway, we topped out an extra toppings of sautéed mushrooms in truffle oil. Another good dish I must say. Lovely Sunday~~ sit back and relax. 👍😀
Love the sauce and the egg is com just right. The brioche is grilled yet soft. 
It\'s after rehearsals and I couldn\'t resist!!! Also, at last.. I get to have Chemex coffee!
Bezt coffee so farrrrr! :D vanessa is happy. #coffee #holiday #afternoon
It\'s never too late to have breakfast.
Croissant is fluffy and crispy done. Goes well with the eggs and bacon!
A perfect well served brunch I had at Toby\'s Estate, It gets really crowded over the weekends. A place you can consider for good hearty brunch.
Didn\'t like the chorizo sausage, but the rest were alright
Filled with chilli con carne and topped with scrambled eggs, this was flavourful and quite good! 
Hot chocolate... #burpple #coffeeandcravings
Chicken Mango Salad... Super inconsistent! Last week\'s had ripe juicy mangoes and this week\'s was awful with inedible raw green sour mangoes!!! And no decency to warn customers of the change in quality either! And when asked the waitress couldn\'t even be bothered to address the issue. Service crew was pretty slack and hard to get their attention too even though the cafe was mostly empty. Really disappointed #burpple #coffeeandcravings
Gibraltar was awesome. Nice strong coffee. Salad was pretty average, but refreshing. I would probably have it again as a safe option. The others had Toby\'s Breakfast but didn\'t have much to rave about it. The scorching heat probably contributed to the fact Toby\'s didn\'t live up to our expectations, apart from the coffee
Tasted pretty much like liang teh. Haha
So many ways of cooking eggs, my fav will still be Scrambled. (Yes, not poached.) Love it when it\'s creamy &amp; oh-la-la smooth with mushrooms on side.
The murder of the eggs series continues...
Truffle oil infused dish. Unique, rich taste on your buds. Ideal for the weekend foodie in all of us :B
Toby\'s Estate, the franchise outlet in Singapore. Originated in Australia, a new found place for individuals with coffee addicts all around gather for the weekend. But after since the main barista has left for good, their standard has dropped but it\'s not too bad for a starter. 
Great food &amp; service! Definitely gonna go back for more. Even though there was a metal piece in our taco, they offered another course on the house including the taco! And despite the metal piece, we still loved the taco! 
Generous serving of smoked salmon, and i love their bread! So soft yet crispy. 
Scrambled eggs were a tad too dry but the brioche was good. $15
Eggs Ben for lunch with @weiyingx. 😋 Thanks for bringing me there babe! Catch up again soon! 😘
Yes, I love this place. Great ambiance and wonderful people who care about making good coffee and food. Come here so often that one of the staff said \"you look familiar!\" &gt;.
Eggs, eggs &amp; more eggs! Lazy Saturday brunch date with the girls! @claireteo @squeakella @gly86
Eggs were runny and I like the fact that they use prosciutto instead of bacon. Would have opted for brioche bread but they ran out. The service not fantastic either
Eggs weren\'t as flowy today but coffee was good.. Mmhmmm loving this life, brunch by the river with ❤
😁 The perfect pair for keeping me sane til the weekend. 😂
Loving those tomato, burst with freshness in your mouth. 😋

Coffee. Rainbow fries. And good #WorkHardAnywhere company of course. ☺️\n<br />⋅\n<br />The WiFi here is pretty slow (non-usable) probably due to too many people (like myself) trying to get some work done. You\'ll probably be better off tethering from your mobile data. If you just need power plugs they have a few under the long table and by the window.\n<br />The coffee was good and the rainbow fries serving was huge! But it gets soggy pretty quickly.\n<br />And the girly side of me is super chuffed about my new Brown Moleskine notebook. Still always back to Brown.

Impromptu brunch with @renhaolee ;) This place has gotta be my new favourite hangout. Great food, rustic interior, &amp; my favourite barista is now working here! @vhaneknek • #foodporn
My almost-weekly dosage of Eggs Benedict and cup of Latte. Ranked Top 10 cafes for Coffee in Singapore to enjoy, it truly does live up to it. The Eggs Benedict itself is also pretty good topped up with its unique taste of the bread and Hollandaise Sauce.\n<br />#EggsBenedict #Brunch #Sgfood #Instafood #Latte #Latteart
It\'s these little details that make all the difference in experience. #tgif #tea #coffee #tobysestate #coffeeroasters #water #paleo #art
