It was a cold stormy night. The oceans are rough, the skies streaks with lightning bolts. Men in tights were diving to pick scallops. And we have Mentai Scallops! 😍😍😍😍😍
Kagoshima wagyu tatami. Almost 20% of Japanese wagyu originate from Kagoshima. The beef is served rare and lightly grilled, with a nice smoked flavour. Beautiful marbling.
Sashimi platter at Sushi Tei. Always can count on them for fresh and thickly sliced sashimi.
One of my fav appetizer at Sushi T. It\'s cold, tasty and gooey!
Flame grilled mentai mayo is mindblowing

Fresh and crunchy char grilled prawns mingled with the smooth salty dressing. It\'s So goooood! They have another miso flavoured one but I like this one better 😁
Good portion size that leaves you feeling refreshed. 
Like the crispy salmon skin which wrap with smoked salmon.
