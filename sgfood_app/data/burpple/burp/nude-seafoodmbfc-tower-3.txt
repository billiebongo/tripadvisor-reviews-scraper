Paired with NUDE Seafood‚Äôs perfectly cooked mains, Matchaya‚Äôs Houjicha Latte is delicate yet robust and fragrant. The right balanced of sweetness, the bottled milk tea is also creamy and smooth. A must-try for fans of Japanese teas! Their roasted green tea latte truly packs a distinctive flavoured punch in every sip.
Sashimi grade fish, grilled, with forgotten grains and pickles. [$17] this fish is really very unique as it is grilled and it retains that bit of smokey flavor, almost like those sliced smoked salmon you find it sandwiches, but much milder, and you know your salmon is fresh. Even though the focus shd be on the salmon here, I\'ll say I enjoyed the forgotten grains just as much, if not more. It is really flavorful unlike the normal healthy tasting grains you find elsewhere. It is seasoned beautifully and every component is well selected to come beautifully. Will definitely have this again the next time I come! 
Aburi salmon belly, ikura, tamago, vegetables on Niigata rice [$17] not bad value for using premium cuts like salmon belly. Not the biggest fan of having it torched as I personally find that it compromises on the quality of the fish used. And it\'s also cut a little too small for my liking. That being said, I really enjoyed the rice. The grains here definitely stand out, the forgotten grains in their smoked salmon bowl is so packed with flavor and texture. Just can\'t get enough of it üòõThis chirashi is a rather new addition to the menu and its only available during lunch! 
My main was the miso grilled Chilean Seabass that seemed pretty popular in reviews of the restaurant. True enough, it did not disappoint. The Seabass tasted really fresh, and the fried wakame and pickled cucumber came together nicely to offer different textures to the dish. The dish came across as clean, tasty and healthy. 
This was the off-the-menu starter recommended to us by the owner - Koji Calamari with Mentaiko sauce. I must confess, I have a tendency to order anything on the menu with the word \'mentaiko\'. The dish didn\'t disappoint at all. Calamari was fresh and crispy with a tangy aftertaste coming from the Koji. Mentaiko sauce was pleasant, although the taste of the mentaiko wasn\'t prominent, but at $10 a serving I\'m not complaining. 
4 munchies: Nicely roasted, meaty fillet of Chilean bass that was well-seasoned with two miso pastes and had a hint of sweetness. I liked the semi-crunchy texture of the quinoa after mixing it with the oozy onsen egg. The crispy seaweed and pickled cucumber also made great sides to help tone down the salty but not overpowering taste of miso.
Extra bursts of flavour everytime the Ikura pops!\n<br />Right now on par with my favourite Chirashi bowls from Teppei, both so different yet tasty and satiating in their own ways. \n<br />15bucks/bowl\n<br />#FTrecommends
Back again at Nude Seafood for dinner, this time as a Guinea Pig for a couple of dishes Chef Jerome\'s testing before it hits their final menu. This huge steak of Salmon sitting on some creamy orzo and blanched asparagus, accompanied with super sweet confit tomatoes is said to be going for 18bucks. You guys are going to be in for a real treat. Also, keep a lookout, Nude Seafood are set to open their second outlet pretty soon. HOORAY!
Back again at Nude Seafood for dinner, this time as a Guinea Pig for a couple of dishes Chef Jerome\'s testing before it hits their final menu. That\'s their version of Crab Pasta, served with chilled angel hair pasta tossed in some black sesame seeds, lime zest, fresh crab meet that arrived earlier in the day, and spheres of Ikura for that extra savoury pop. I\'d love to see this on their future lunch menu, all you MBFC office boys and girls are so gonna love this! Also, keep a lookout, Nude Seafood are set to open their second outlet pretty soon.

One of my favourite dishes this evening at NUDE Seafood\'s Friday Feast, the prawn was perfectly cooked retaining its natural sweetness and a tender texture. The chilled capellini was flavourful without being excessively seasoned. #yummy #foodporn #burpple

Just had an extremely satisfying lunch at @nudeseafood, so glad that the mister and I managed to make time for this! \n<br />This pair of juicy herb grilled King Prawns, served with pickled Starfruit slices, sits on a bed of barley risotto, crunchy nori and garlic shoots. Everything\'s just a merry dance on my palette. Prawns were huge, fresh, fleshy and well seasoned; you\'ll be happy to know that they\'re brought in fresh daily too. Barley risotto had so much umami flavour that keeps you going back for more.  \n<br />Head Chef @jeromelim explained that his ideals are making the freshest tastiest seafood available at affordable prices for the masses.

Their Signature Duo comprises of Hickory Smoked Salmon, Grilled Miso Chilean Seabass, some pickled gourds, a good mix of grains that include red rice, oats, almonds and chickpeas. Great amount of smoke on the Salmon with a nice touch of salt, and the Chilean Seabass coated in miso, had flakes so tender and moist, executed so well that the sweetness of the fillet spoke for itself; easily one of the best Chilean Seabass I\'ve had! \n<br />Keeping part of their menu in relation to sustainability of seafood, the Chilean Seabass will soon be switched up for something else. So folks who\'ve loved this dish, best head back before the change or keep your eyes peeled for their new item! \n<br />30bucks/serving \n<br />#FTrecommends #grilled #salmon #lunch #nudeseafood #mbfc
Dark chocolate &amp; rum, accompanied by homemade vanilla ice cream, poached cherries with anise, cherry gel, raspberries. Slurps ;) 
Salmon was only poached on 1 side and still raw on the bottom. Would\'ve preferred seared through b\'cos the raw portion wasn\'t as firm as I would\'ve liked... 
Amazing lightly poached king prawn. Prawn head was still full of umami goodness. The slight disappointment was that the natural sweetness was somewhat overshadowed by the wakame. Sooooo good nonetheless. Favourite of the evening 
Part of the Friday Feast 4-course platter. I liked the roasted variation best! Complete w cherry tomatoes and a pumpkinseed tulle! 
Serving up the fresh seafood at affordable prices - that\'s the motto of the NUDE team. The menu is rather small and we were bummed they ran out of the king prawn barlotto, but the fish was amazing. #seafood
Why not end with Churros with chai tea and togarashi. Vanilla ice cream, madeleines, lemon custard, strawberry compote and almond nougatine. \n<br />Sweet, messy and fun. Just how monster likes it. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #nudeseafood
This kept the texture of fried fish without all that oil. \n<br />Served with burnt scallion cream cheese, red cabbage slaw, smoked oyster pur√©e, honey-roasted apples, caramelised pecans, blistered cherry tomatoes and daikon petals. \n<br />A little overwhelming with the many different heavy flavors. Needed a lighter element to bring the dish together. \n<br />Monster was surprised by the apples. They looked like potatoes. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #nudeseafood
What salad? This is art on a platter. \n<br />Shishito pepper tempura, roasted cauliflower, honey-coriander baby carrots, sweet potato, black sesame rice puff, micro shiso, Parmesan reduction, beetroot gel, miso-chickpea glaze and sunflower seeds. \n<br />There\'s an endless combinations of flavor and texture with each bite. Enough to tempt even the staunchest of carnivores. \n<br />Monster wants a garden of his own to munch on. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #nudeseafood
Appetizers was an abundance of savory Salmon belly tartare. The secret star of this dish was the Umami butter, to which the recipe was kept a secret but I definitely taste seaweed in it. It was sweet, salty and just Umami. Fantastic even on its own. \n<br />Butter is life. At least monster thinks so. \n<br />#hungryhungrymonster #nudeseafood
Good food, great service, best coffee. This creamy silky bowl of goodness never fails to make my day. 
I absolutely loved the Salmon. Grilled perfectly. Together w brown rice and barley risotto, it was the perfect meal to end the day

Hickory smoked salmon with forbidden grains and purple slaw. Haven\'t been back at @nudeseafood in ages and am glad to see that they have maintained their fish quality and are serving larger potions for their grains and greens. I absolutely love their new forgotten grains, shorter grains are used and the consistency is different, almost like glutinous rice without the heaviness of the latter.

A damn near perfect dish, I must say! At one of my fave restaurants in Singapore.
üîºüîº\n<br />Expected it to be too sweet because of the kaya but the sweetness level was just nice. The interior had the consistency of the kaya and the outer was crunchy.\n<br />üîºüîº\n<br />Given complimentary. Available only from 7 to 9 Dec.
The surprise component was the melty foie gras with a sprinkling of golden brown crispy garlic bits. ‚óæ‚óæ\n<br />This dish is concocted just for their 2nd year anniversary and is only available from 7th to 9th Dec.

But felt the heavy raindrops falling on my head while hobbling on my sore ankle. Lol!!\n<br />What I like about this place are the different flowers I see each time I visit. So chio!
Starting off with the king prawns, they\'re huge! Needless to say, they are very fresh too, and comes with juicy heads too. Definitely not for high cholesterol wimps
The last time I had this hickory smoked salmon with quinoa, there wasnt any purple cabbage (my favorite by the way).\n<br />üîπ\n<br />When I made my order, I had to ask. Salmon was delish with a heavy smoky aftertone. Quinoa nice and a wonderful nutty crunch. Comes down to the (all time fave color) purple cabbage. Fresh &amp; crisp with a sweetilicious dressing.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />See that little dot on the left. A grain that almost got away. It was not spared. The dish was happily demolished spick and span. Personally i loved every bit and bite.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />Visited Nude a few times already and what made me happy was they remembered my name. A huge plus point in terms of service indicator. I did not see the boss today.. would have wanted to say hello &amp;  thank you as the last visit he treated us to complimentary sweetcorn ice cream which I sorely missed.

Couldnt hide my disappointment and prolly hit (reflex action) my friend\'s shoulder a few times.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />Ended having this perfectly cooked snapper with quinoa and baby vegs. The quinoa was infused with lapcheong and mixed up with very tiny cured duck meat. Quinoa had a terrific nutty smoky flavor which my lunch kaki totally loved. Whilst all these components were delish, the one and only element which I didnt fancy was the preserved bakchoy. It was preserved using japanese daikon and had a very tangy &amp; citrussy aftertaste.\n<br />üîπ\n<br />Overall I truly enjoyed the snapper which was tender and moist with a tinge of miso.

So before that...a little surprise to my foodie kaki. \n<br />He has not been to this restaurant before and was pleasantly thrilled to see how lovely the interior was.

he not only apologized, he offered free dessert for us which we actually refused cos we just wanted to give our feedback. he insisted and before we could refuse again, he was gone and back at our table with this good looking thing - (not too) sweet and crumbly, filled with some kind of custard (?) and raisins. so easy to eat and rather addictive! thank you @nudeseafood! @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #setheats #burpple #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #dessert #biscuit #nudeseafood

so my \'date\' had the Salmon while I tried the Bass, which to me was very nicely done too but if I had to make a choice between the 2 fish, I will still go for the Salmon any time cos somehow the sides just make for a more wholesome meal and leaves me feeling a lot more satisfied and \"Ahhhhhh.... Awesome meal!\" (if u know what I mean).

the entire fish is just so good, you\'d wish you will never reach the last bite. the dish is very well complemented by the mountain of  grains/chickpeas/tomatoes and a side of grilled zucchini (at least that\'s what I think it was) which balances out the textures and neutralizes the tastes. I don\'t know how but the whole dish is just really awesome, for lack of better word. best part is, the service here is GREATTTT! extremely friendly and helpful and they don\'t even charge GST/Service Charge! at only SGD16, they can definitely count me as a regular customer soon! üòÅ‚úåüèºÔ∏è @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia # #brunch #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #nudeseafood #seafood #salmon #mbfc
