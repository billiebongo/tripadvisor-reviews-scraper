Monday\'s salad ritual has officially started! One last sem to go. 
I can seriously eat this everyday. Actually it is what I eat almost everyday.
Post leg day fuel! Time to work on the thesis now.. 😩
$5.50 salad bowl again! This time I tried sweet lemon dressing nice tangy but a little oily. And their pilaf is pretty good and it has bits of chorizo, seafood! but there goes a low carb meal. And small food bowl is really damn filling - this guy next to me was complaining. So yepp value for money!

But yes, who can miss such good and affordable salads! 😊
