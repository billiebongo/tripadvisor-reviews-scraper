You get a Caesar salad. Thank you, I already know I‚Äôm the funniest Russell round town, but thanks for the reaffirmation.
The salad bar. Yes yes, settle down now, I know that was an absolute banger. Trash tier jokes aside, Peperoni decided to do something completely out of the norm for a pizzeria with their new menu. Yep, they introduced a line of salads.
Peperoni‚Äôs new line of appetizers that have been baked in their wood fired oven are lit AF. Unfortunately, they had run out of their ricotta stuffed bell peppers, so we were left with their absolutely ambrosial trio of rosemary chicken wings, Italian sausages and garlic herb tiger prawns.
Granted, they do their pizzas very well, but there are more than just pizzas to be had at Peperoni. From the wood-fired oven also comes a series of sharing dishes such as this one: fresh tiger prawns in an aromatic pool made up of garlic herb butter and pepperoni.
All 12\" pizzas are $24. They do reliable pizzas here on the thin crust type. Crunchy light crust. I enjoy this but my top pick would always be a tasty crust with a bit of chew and good air bubbles showing mature flavour. They got the egg right where many places seem to overcook.. kudos!
$24. Thin crunchy crust. 12\". Nice but could have a little more honey.
The usual to get here for most people is the Parma ham and rocket, but for those looking to try something new and yet equally wonderful, I highly recommend getting the four cheese and salmone! While the four cheese packs a whole lot of punch in terms of depth of savoury goodness, the salmone is lighter and comes with HUGE and FRESH chunks of salmon (that is cooked to perfection) and spiced up by the capers. Also loved the pesto and this veggie pasta dish that really came as a pleasant surprise!
Look at this prawn oglio ($28)! Not on the menu but they\'d serve it if you asked for it! That crazy serving of prawns! Not bad, not bad at all. But the service over at the Zion Road outlet can be MUCH better.
Your stomach is grumbling. You look down at your watch and realise it‚Äôs after 10pm. Where can you still get dinner?
Damn good pepperoni pizza for 50 bucks. Portion is good for 3 men.

Here comes the larger-than-life #pizzas! Am helplessly in love.

One last birthday surprise for the birthdayboy with the FunBunch! Humongous 21\" of bacon and Parma ham brought pizza to a whole new level!
Vongole üçù Good food but lousy service. I will be back if the staff don\'t serve me food that is meddled by customers of another table again üò°
The non-pizza main courses are a first for me at Peperoni. Baked Seafood Misto ($24++) is one for the seafood lovers. Generous amounts of fish, tiger prawns, squid, &amp; venus clams bursting with juicy flavours. We were told to try the seafood on its own first, before deciding whether we should squeeze some of the lemon over it. We unanimously decided against the lemon because this dish was just THAT FLAVOURFUL. Nothing but umami goodness, as our eyes widened with delight upon tucking in.
Nice doneness! Good size portion.
Hahaha so hugeee but it was delicioso~ üòã
