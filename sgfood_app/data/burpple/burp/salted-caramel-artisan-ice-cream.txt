I had brownie w/ icecream. Too good!!! The combination is indescribable 😋
This has to be my favourite flavour of Salted Caramel. The heaviness of the chocolate was excellently balanced out by the lightness of the sorbet texture, so you can just keep eating spoon after spoon without getting sick of it. Heard of lemon or strawberry sorbet, but rarely do I hear of chocolate sorbet ($3.60). The other flavours are really good, but none can capture my heart entirely like this flavour does. (I know the picture doesn\'t do the taste justice, but believe it, it\'s goooood) 
Best of both worlds! Atop yummeh waffles. I still prefer creamier though hmm
I\'m sure this ice-cream shop is already well-known! Speculoos and brownie vanilla are two of my favourite flavours☺️
Heard many great things about Salted Caramel\'s waffles and ice cream. The ice cream lived up to its name, however that cannot be said about their waffles.
Salted caramel flavor never fails to deliver. Yuzu ginger tasted pretty interesting
my favourite flavor is definitely the Horlicks one hOooOoo I love it when the gigantic balls of ice cream have crunchy thingies in them and the Horlicks one had a slight salty flavor too!!! super affordable BUT GOOD $3.50 waffles too!! 
They bring joy, delight and comfort to the ones who appreciates them.
Here\'s where I\'d always head to to fix my cravings for waffles and ice cream in a jiffy😙
Really great flavours especially the Expresso &amp; Carmel biscuit. 
Great variety of ice cream flavors to choose from, and very nice waffles too! 
We had the waffles with matcha, salted caramel and speculoos ice cream ($13.40) which was relatively affordable! The waffles were made to perfection with crisp outsides and soft fluffy insides. This coupled with amazing ice cream was just perfection. 
What\'s better than a delicious ice-cream to end a meal? Please read my review at www.hungryghost.sg
Needs no introduction, really. Prolly cause of the hype, I was kind of disappointed. Thought the waffle was slightly too dense for my liking ): the chocolate ice cream though, was of really good quality- thick, rich and not too sweet. 
on another note, I can\'t believe that I got rejected for wanting to buy a waffle bowl because I only bought one scoop. WHY MUST I GET TWO SCOOPS? fed up with such unscrupulous policy. im still paying for the waffle bowl right? \n<br />what\'s ya view ?
🌼Rate: 8/10\n<br />^Bought 2 scoops for $5.60 (horlick and cookies and cream) +waffle cone or waffle bowl (?) Add $1. Pretty worth buying it, Definitely recommended. 👍
Waffle with a scoop of must Holicks Tam Tam ice-cream, topped with maple syrup. Just $6.80.\n<br />Sinfully but yummy.
After sampling flavours i opted for the Rockmelon $3.30 per scoop. It\'s rather creamy and was not as flavourful as I was hoping for. The other flavours were also rather creamy and lacked the punch.
Salted Caramel flavour was AMAZING. It\'s no wonder that has became their shop name. It wasn\'t too salty like some other shops and the amount of sweetness is also just right. I personally don\'t like dark chocolate but my friend who does absolutely adored it. Worth a try!
@9.10$ one of the more affordable waffles ice cream around (but Alfero Gelato was only 11.5$ would def pay the extra 2.4$ given a choice) the yuzu ginger really hits the spot for someone with an acquired taste like me! Sweet and refreshing yet still creamy 😋😋
Saying hi to fats
salted caramel and holicks timtam are my fav flavors here scooped into a waffle bowl. what about you?
There were many flavors to choose from, but because I wanted something light, I went for the Earl Grey. It definitely did not disappoint - the texture was creamy and thick and the flavor light but still apparent. One of the best ice creams I\'ve had, hands down!
I\'m madly in love with their ice cream topped on warm waffles &amp; caramel sauce. Oh yes these are all for myself btw! They\'re open till 2am on weekends! 😍 
My all time favourite (Horlick tim tam) and raspberry sorbet hidden below!
Earl grey &amp; Horlick timtam that rhymes with yumyum (kinda)! waffles were crispy and it was affordable at an additional $3.50, but I don\'t think I\'d come here for wafffffles. Prefer NeLi\'s ice cream which I tried a looong time ago when I was in the area (not sure if it still exists? Didn\'t notice it when I was walking around)
Earl grey, aalted caramel, matcha and pistachio ice cream! Goodie :) | ★★★★☆
Combat cold, with more cold! Met up with the bunch and shared two waffles! Featuring Horlicks Tim Tam, Baileys, Raspberry Sorbet, Salted Caramel and Peppermint Choc! We all loved what we selected! 
Mandatory sweet treat after lunch. Going back to basics with their Tahitian Vanilla today, which is rich in its scent and not overwhelmingly sweet despite its simplicity.
How can one not order salted caramel flavour when dining here ;) And it didn\'t disappoint, I like that their ice-creams are not too sweet. Yuzu ginger is interesting too, smooth ice-cream base with bits of sugared ginger.
Satisfying after-meal sweet treat that hits the spot, having that strong caffeine coupled with sweet and sticky crumbs that works so well.
I need to stop having the same thing over and over 😂😂
$9.10 for 2 scoops of ice cream plus waffles. The ice creams are great as usual  but the waffle is lacking the crispy yet soft on the inside texture. Overall still a nice dessert and good place to chill out! :)
Abt $10 for this delish waffle PLUS two scoops of ice cream. Waffles slightly hard but matches well with the ice cream. Earl grey and espresso with caramel bits flavors were dreamy. Yums!
Wide varieties of ice cream to choose but disappointed with the waffle. 
At only $3.50 for a homemade waffle, this comes at pretty good value. Pick a couple of their unique ice cream flavours to go along with the crisp waffle, $3 for a single and $5 for a double scoop. Go for their Salted Caramel and the Horlicks Tim Tam flavours. 
Have you read the article about our Singapore MNCs appeite for risk. YES! that\'s why we can\'t grow out frm our tiny dot. dream big. don\'t settle for less
Everything is just good. But always a tad too noisy because it\'s always packed with big groups of people. With so many different flavors and nice waffles, it\'s not hard to understand why it\'s so popular. 
Simply delicious! Perfect for school friends gatherings and outings! :) or just simply for hanging out after major exams! XD
Good ice cream but bad waffle. It was super soft and tasteless 
The prices are pocket friendly and this is a place for decent ice cream waffles (can\'t compare the waffles itself to others in the market tho) especially when the waffle itself is only $3.50. I love to have it w maple syrup and the flavors Salted Caramel and Milo Crunch. Also they do sell their ice creams in pints at $12. 
5.70 for double scoops! The best salted caramel icecream so far (:
Yummy crispy, light &amp; fluffy waffle topped with ice cream &amp; maple syrup! In this case, Earl Grey Tea &amp; Mint with Brownies ice cream 😊 had to share because I was pretty full from the Prata place next to it (check it out too!) 
:) finally we got time for discipling yay 😊😊 went to salted caramel - the waffles is crispy which is good haha cause it will not turn soggy (??) the ppl there are really nice ! They give suggestion but the place is really far ! :( #food #vscocam
A range of weird ice cream flavours. Not to forget their crispy waffles and nutella ice cream! Their specialty: salted caramel ice cream (uhm.. obviously?!).
Ordered the signature Salted Caramel &amp; Horlicks icecream. Personally preferred the salted caramel flavour. Waffles were fluffy and yummy! Reasonably priced! Bill was ard S$12. 
Waffles With Maple Syrup Served With Nutella Ice Cream at just $5.90 per waffle and $3.50 for every scoop of ice cream! Crunch crunch~
My fav Horlicks &amp; Tim Tams ice cream.  Sorry @wiltian I would have visited Nov 8 had I not been so full.  Will def drop by next time :)
Having exams soon? Keep calm and have some ice cream waffles! ^^
At only $3.50 for a homemade waffle, this comes at a pretty good value. Pick a couple of their unique ice cream flavours to go along with the crisp waffle, $3 for a single and $5 for a double scoop. Go for their Salted Caramel and the Horlicks Tim Tam flavours. Photo by Make Your Calories Count.
Salted caramel serves really good waffles and ice cream flavors. Great place for late night chill out as they open till 2am during the weekends! (:
Finally trying this place after hearing so much abt it! We had a scoop of Earl Grey, Nutella, Horlicks with Tim Tams and of course Salted Caramel! Oh yeahhh 😎
Great taste in salted caramel and tim tam chunks found in horlicks tim tam! Waffle also has fragrance of eggs! Nice combination along with the chocolate fudge!
Pretty nice and unique ice cream flavour. contains chunks of cookies too! Perfect on a hot afternoon!
Earl grey ice cream is pretty good! But the salted caramel was sort of average which kinda contradicting. Waffle is crisp on the outside and soft inside, however its quite bland. Overall, value for money, and must try their Earl Grey ice cream
\"When Mag wants ice cream, Mag gets ice cream.\" - Le boyfriend is so nice to me 😊🍨
One last good meal to end off this weekend. It\'s gonna be the start of my nightmare tmr 😔
Espresso with caramel bits, Kahlua &amp; Salted Caramel! When it arrived my dad was like \"eh why all same colour!!\" hahahaha oops ;)
At my fav icecream and waffles place. Tried their new espresso &amp; caramel biscuit flavour and the usual salted caramel. Wasn\'t that bad!
It\'s been long since I last indulge after the trip. I\'ve amazingly lost 6kg in just 8 days with some crazy cardio and single meal a day. Hahaha totally unhealthy I know. Anyway, apart from my fav earl grey, salted caramel and vanilla. TRY the new roasted pistachio flavour!!! Yummy!

Had the Sundae ($8) which comes with 2 scoops of ice cream, a topping &amp; chocolate sauce! It tasted nothing amusing but scoops were generous! Nice to just chill &amp; goossip with friends even tho it could get a lil crowded &amp; busy! 
I am so crazy idgi. But the waffle is not bad, light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, not really what I like because... CREAMIER, MY GOODNESS. MAN, I really need to stop thinking about Creamier. ON ANOTHER NOTE, they have this interesting Holick flavor... and I saw there\'s this Stout and Chocolate. No idea what that is, should have asked to tried. Oh well, maybe next time. \n<br />#food #sgfood #foodsg #foodie #foodporn #foodpic #foodphoto #foodgasm #instafood #foodstagram #foodorgasm #foodphotography #sgcafe #cafesg #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #latergram #vsco #sgvsco #burpple #hungrygowhere #eatout #icecream #waffle #desserts

I ordered a new flavor called Lemon Meringue Pie and I love it, it\'s light and refreshing!
Don\'t really recall seeing this flavour at Salted Caramel previously. Despite its light taste, its quite surprising how this flavour was a proper ice-cream instead of a sorbet. Light melon flavours with a bit of zest, tasted much like Guava to me which was pretty adequate for a sweet yet soft dessert after a heavy tasting meal.

Horlicks Tim Tam and Avocado ice cream in a Waffle Bowl. Tried these upon recommendation by @abcdeunice - avocado\'s too \"healthy\" for me, but Horlicks ice cream, I\'ll never turn down. #icecream #waffle #horlicks #timtam #avocado #sweet #dessert #foodporn #sgfood #ilovemyjob
Awesome! Cheaper than Gelare/Marble Slab!! Less than $10. Value for money and the ice cream\'s just perfect. 
Still my favorite ice cream place with affordable price. 
Yummy yummy in my tummy. Gym &gt; dimsum &gt; icecream . Tried rum and raisin which was meh cos of the amount of alcohol. Too much&gt;
