The drink is simply too awesome &amp; it goes well w/ the marshmallow💖😍😘#buttercakencream  #burpple
The mussels are super fresh &amp; delicious. It\'s also served w/ brioche bread. #buttercakencream #burpple
Looking at the menu, I was spoiled for choice with the wide variety of mains they offer. Settled for the Seafood Aglio Olio [$14.90] and the Roasted Teriyaki Chicken Leg [$15.90]. The scallops, prawns and clams were really fresh and I like how the chef spammed the garlic. For the roasted teriyaki chicken dish, the highlight was the wasabi sauce drizzled over the salad. A pity that the fries were soggy and a tad too salty for my liking. Overall, I had an enjoyable experience with both the food and desserts and I definitely see myself coming back again. #sgfoodsteps #sgfood  #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #sgfoodunion #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #sgeats #sgigfoodies #Tinlicious #eatoutsg #burpple #openricesg
