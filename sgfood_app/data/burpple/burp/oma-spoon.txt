This had NY cheesecake, generous portions of fresh mango cubes, cranberries, almonds, walnuts, mango ice cream and blueberry purée embedded in the milk flakes.  I liked it but the price points is a little high at $18.90.
We tried the Mango Cheesecake Bingsu, that is one of their recommendations. Sweet diced mango and cranberries with snowy yogurt-taste ice, it does offer a different bingsu experience from other places.
O\'ma Spoon is a Korean dessert café with outlets at both Marina Square and 313@somerset. This café offers a variety of pure milk-based bingsus in both single (Petit Bingsu) and two-person portions, as well as a few other items such as their Injeolmi Toast, with prices ranging from $4.80 to $22.80. Go for their Chocolate Brownie and Banana Bingsu ($18.80), a mammoth mountain of pure indulgence featuring their milky snow with fudgy brownies, chocolate cookie crumbles, banana slices, chopped nuts drizzled with chocolate sauce and finally topped with chocolate ice cream!
A little late to the bingsu party but I just have to say that the powdery snow-like shaved frozen milk here is unbelievably velvety and fluffy! The cheesecake is nothing to write home about and I felt that I would have enjoyed this more without the blueberry sauce. Next time, I\'ll probably just have the super milky finely-shaven ice topped with some fruits to relish its pure unadulterated goodness.
The best friend and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Chunks of sweet mangoes, with blueberry hidden beneath, topped with a very dense chunky cheesecake (which was ok but I could do without). And of course the fluffy milk flakes which melted real quick. 
Finally jumped onto the bingsu bandwagon. Have to admit I\'m not a desserts guy, but I enjoyed the soft ice flakes together with the fresh milk, mixes of sweetness &amp; a variety of berry and nuts. Perfect remedy to a blazing hot day and a good place to catch up with friends.
Brought Mum to O\'ma Spoon to give her a sweet treat and celebrate Mother\'s Day. This is the first time she\'s trying bingsu and she totally love it! Thanks Mummy for all the hard work and sacrifice you have made to raise me up. I love you and Happy Mother\'s Day! 
Served by a very friendly and polite Korean staff.. Thumbs up for the service!! Overall loved the texture of the shaved iced and the taste of the passionfruit sauce, and would have been even better if they were more generous with the amount of sauce. The nuts also added an interesting texture and taste to the bingsu.
Essentially pleasant shaved milk ice that is slightly coarser than its fancier and more indulgently-priced bretheren (we detected some hard ice goblins playing in the snow) but the trade-off is its more manageable price point and the availability of single portions. The green tea element was powdery and tastefully bitter. 3.7/5
Another place that sells snowflake-like Korean bingsu!😊 We had the &gt; and just look at the size of it. 😂 It\'s good for sharing between 3-5pax! Basically an upsize of their signature \'mango cheesecake\'! Ps: actually I just want to show my nicely curled hair done at @PAVOhairstudio!🙈🙊 Thank you Phyllis for the effort!☺️ quote \'lirongs\' to get 20% off for haircut and 15% off for other services!😊
I just want some amazing n delicious bingsu from O\'ma spoon!
Who cares if it\'s cold and rainy outside? It\'s always a good idea to indulge in some bingsu!
The lady recommended that we try their signature Injeolmi Bingsu which is basically fluffy milk shavings with toppings like soya bean powder, rice case, nuts , almonds. First bite together with rice cake tasted abit like having mua chee... but together with the milk shavings, it brought it to a whole new level... so yummy! A little pricey for shave ice though.. $11.90 for a bowl.. good service btw!
The Korean bingsu crave has hit our local shores like how Titanic hit the icebergs. But this time round, it didn\'t sink as O\'ma spoon serves some pretty good desserts. Give their Green Tea Bingsu ($12.90) a go and you will agree how the milky shaved ice, matcha ice cream, red bean and nuts combination is a refreshing treat to battle the heat. 
Who can resist these super fine snow flakes dessert? Seriously I cant 😋😋😋😋😋
It appears that there is an opening of a new Korean dessert joint every few weeks, and joining Banana Tree this month is O\'ma Spoon, situated on the fourth floor of Marina Square. O\'ma Spoon offers a variety of milk-based bingsus in both single and 2-people portions as well as a few other items such as their Injeolmi Toast, with the price ranging from $4.80 to $22.80. Go for their Strawberry and Green Tea Bingsus for a cooling, melt-in-your-mouth treat.
Chanced upon this new bingsu place \"O\'ma Spoon\", situated at Level 4 Marina Square. They have wide price range from $4.80 to $22.80 to offer variety of selections for customers.
Can considered trying it as the shaved ice here is really fine and it literally melt in your mouth! Not that bad i would say. Plus the owner is really friendly &amp; naise 😋😋😋 #burpple
From O\'ma Spoon Korean Dessert Cafe situated at Level 4 outside the food court. Unlike their two person portion Bingsu, the single portion uses yogurt-based shaved ice than milk-based shaved ice. The overall flavour this becomes a bit more sour, which goes pretty nicely with the strawberries. The ice was shaved pretty fine, which was smooth. Overall I still prefer the Milk-based ice though because I am not a fan of yogurt, but if you love yogurt do give this a try.
From O\'ma Spoon Korean Dessert Cafe outside the food court at Level 4. Their Injeolmi Toast was pretty decent with crusty toast with rice cake in between, covered with soy powder and served with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream drizzled in chocolate sauce. Its decently nutty, and the ice-cream drizzled in chocolate sauce seemed to exude a hazelnut flavour when combined. Pretty liked the rice cake served in between too; chewy but also had a toasty flavour as though it was grilled.
From O\'ma Spoon Korean Dessert Cafe outside the food court at Level 4. This is the two person portion, and comes with milk-based shaved ice with green tea powder, Azuki red beans and green tea ice-cream atop. Green Tea flavour was evident throughout and the ice was shaved till really fine so it was smooth and melt-in-the-mouth without having to bite. Recommended.
The snowy shaved milk and chewy rice cakes are the winners in this Injelomi Bingsu.\n<br />•\n<br />O\'ma Spoon\n<br />Address: 6, Raffles Boulevard, Marina Square, Unit 04-102, Singapore 039594 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #Makansutra #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #omaspoon #omaspoonsg #koreanbingsu

Its Mango Cheesecake for me!! 😄
Nice but I still dig the mango cheese cake version better.
Had the cheesecake mango Bingsu again because it\'s really good.
Nice but melt very fast
#엄마 엄마 사랑해~~ Totally loving this milkflake based #bingsu! Can\'t wait to try other brands In Singapore as well. It\'s the bingsu wave over here now!

👯 Price is comparable to Nunsongyee at $18.90 (aka very ex) but so are their standards (aka 👍🏻)! Considering that oma\'s ice is also soft and milky like snowflake, has way better location in town,... and bigger on taste/flavour, O\'ma spoon is like my new top favorite now!! Super excites for their 313 branch to open so I can have moaaaarrr #omaspoon #빙수 #먹스타그램 #mango #cheesecake #icecream #bingsu #dessertporn #feelandeat #snappytrend #yum #saturdate #korean #food #desserts #sgfood #cafehoppingsg #cafesg #omnomnom #openricesg #eatoutsg #instafood_sg #burpple
