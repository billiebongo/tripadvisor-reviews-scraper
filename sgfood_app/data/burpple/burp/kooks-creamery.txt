I like the match lave cookie 👍\n<br />But the ice cream is too sweat
Milky taste of matcha filling with ooey gooey cookie = perfect match 💯 However I do not recommend their earl grey ice cream as it has a very strong aftertaste to it. But you can try the  ferrero ice-cream 😍😍👍🏻
Two of my favourites in one dish, what\'s not to love about it. Matcha lava cookie with a scoop of Speculoos ice cream ($8.50), both instagrammable and delicious. The cookie was chewy and soft, and went very well with the cinnamon crumble. Would eat ten of this (or not, but I wish I could)
😍😍😍\n<br />We topped it with speculoos - we liked the ice cream cuz of the hint of cinnamon 😋 the taste was enhanced by the soft &amp; warm cookie!!! Defo a must try 😋😋😋\n<br />#Burpple #burpplesg #happybellyMe #ICEscream
There\'s been an overkill of waffle and ice cream places of late and generally most places are...meh...
Cost $8.50, its not bad &amp; it was served fresh but i dont think its worth the price. Too expensive &amp; small!
To say that their lava cookie is fragile would be an apt description. The mere weight of a scoop of ice cream will cause its molten chocolatey content to ooze out. This dessert might be small in size but huge in enjoyment. 
Tame your next sweet craving at this quaint new cafe in Serangoon (it\'s down the road from Cafe Plain Jane). KOOKS Creamery specialises in molten lava cookies ($5.50 each) — soft-centred cookies holding luscious, oozy centre. Their hand-crafted ice cream (from $3.60 a scoop) is pretty good too! For best value, get the Lava Cookie Set ($8.50), which sees either a chocolate or matcha lava cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream. Get creative with pairing ice cream flavours, or be inspired by Burpplers who seem to love pairing the cookies with nougat, Ferroro Rocher and lemon curd ice cream. Yum!\n<br />Avg price: $10 or less\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Felicia Sim
I found the cookie infused matcha with ice cream to be a nice break from waffles with ice cream. I actually liked this combination better. I guess cutting up the piping hot cookie and eating it with cold and delicious ice cream is really sweet indulgence. I must add I have been here twice and the second time the cookie felt a bit soggy even before I cut it up. On good days though, I\'ll prefer this to any waffles with ice cream. A little more consistency perhaps?
Definitely a crowd-pleaser when the ice-cream hits the warm, freshly-baked cookie as the chocolate sauce oozes out of the centre😍 we went with nougat ice-cream atop chocolate centre cookie(their signature lava set) and though slightly pricey for the small portion,(wished the cookie was bigger) it was a delightful mix of hot and cold👍 A unique dessert indeed!
Soft centered cookie with warm oozy matcha lava flowing out as the scoop of ice cream rest its weight on the cookie. We went for a safe pairing with the nougat ice cream. With the matcha cookie, it was generally on the sweeter side. If you want a unique and refreshing flavor, do give the raspberry lychee a try!
$8.50 for this aesthetically pleasing matcha lava cookie set (extra $0.50 for premium ice cream flavours) that makes you scream \"I LAVA YOOOUUU\" tho the cookie\'s a tad sweet but the nougat icecream paired with it was creamy and smooth in texture with bits of almonds &amp; fruits. Wished the cookie would be slightly bigger tho ☹️
Spending the weekend hanging out in my hood and returned to @kookscreamery
Because lava cakes are so yesterday. Kooks Creamery introduced the molten lava cookies that we decided we just had to try it! Signature Lava Cookie with Ferrero Rocher Ice Cream ($8.50) was pretty amazing! Taste just like a warm and soft baked cookie with chocolate oozing out if it, coating the ferrero rocher ice cream. Sweetness overload! Go visit if you want to try something different! ————————————————————————\n<br />Find out more\n<br />http://wp.me/p73MHP-ir or\n<br />https://peanutloti.wordpress.com\n<br />————————————————————————
Molten lava matcha, surreptitiously hidden within a warm gooey cookie fresh out of the oven, oozes out with a certain zeal as a scoop of ice cream collapses the cookie. A toothsome medley of hot, cold and gooey all in a gratifying feast for the eyes.
The most amazing lava cookie EVER. This is pretty late cause I\'ve been nursing a pretty awful cold, but no time like now go show it off right? Run by two sisters, @kookscreamery is the littlest, cutest store in Hougang that serves up some super smooth, super creamy and interesting ice cream flavours. Not too out of the world, but wacky enough to keep your interest, they serve up Milk Cereal, Brown Butter, Nougat, Matcha (of course), Ferrer Rocher and a few others. But you MUST get it with the lava cookie. It comes in chocolate or matcha flavours, but as you place the scoop of ice cream over the cookie, MOLTEN CHOCOLATE OVERFLOWETH~ Like liuuuuu.. It is a smooth chocolate river that bursts from the centre and warms up the cold sweet treat. The crumbly, homemade cookie complements it perfectly. I love how it\'s soft like Mrs Fields cookies, but with enough crunch to add to the texture of the dish.
yummy ice cream with oozing molten lava cookies 😣💚😣! Another ideal place to visit after meals and it\'s along the same place as the plain jane!
#Matcha ice cream on molten matcha cookie by @kookscreamery just opposite Serangoon stadium along the same stretch as The Plain Jane! 🙌 Now you don\'t have to go jb to enjoy this ^^!\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />If you love matcha as much as us, check out our new blog post! \n<br />http://wp.me/p73MHP-5T or \n<br />peanutloti.wordpress.com\n<br />————————————————————————\n<br />Will appreciate it if you would like and share our FB post/page as well! \n<br />https://www.facebook.com/peanutloti/posts/1725407764378433\n<br />————————————————————————
Like how ice-cream parlors these days seemed to have come out with creative eats to pair up with ice-cream. This oozing cookie is served hot, while the ice cream is plopped onto the cookie right at your table. The cookie is soft on the top, for that tastefully bittersweet matcha lava within has to burst from within at the moment the ice-cream lands onto the cookie, but the bottom remains a buttery, crunchy cookie that anyone would love. I ordered mine with the Nougat ice-cream which is creamy and smooth in texture, and carrying milky flavours while coming with bits of almonds and fruit just like how a nougat is usually.
.\n<br />My neighbourhood gets more exciting as we welcome a new addition serving baked cookies with molten fillings.\n<br />.\n<br />While mine didn\'t really flow aesthetically, the scoop of gelato was supposed to crush the cookie and unleash an overflowing fountain of lava that makes people goes ooooooohhhh.\n<br />.\n<br />Other interesting gelato flavours to note are Brown Butter, Milk Cereal, Lemon Curd and Nougat.
Unusual ice cream flavour offerings include nougat, rock melon, lemon curd, brown butter and milk cereal, while the increasingly ubiquitous video starlet-esque heavy lava flows (ewwwww - Feminine Hygiene Editor) come in chocolate and matcha flavours.
Truly a lava cookie!!

Part of the #eatmoresg \'s October #kovanfoodtrail, we tried the matcha molten lava cookie topped with strawberry cheesecake ice cream. The flavours are light, not too sweet and certainly not cloying at all! Experiment with the different flavours of ice cream available here!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfood #sgcafefood #sgfoodporn #foodsg #singaporeinsiders #sgfoodie #instasg #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #yoursingapore #foodiesg #foodpornsg #instafood_sg #exploresingapore  #foodstagram #BurppleSG #Burpple #wishuponatart_eats #icecream #cookie #dessert

Freshly baked hot molten chocolate lava cookie paired with their cold brown butter ice cream.
Thank you for bringing me there! \'Twas one of the best combination I\'ve ever had. 😋\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #singaporeinsiders #nomsterofficial #eatoutsg #latergram #instadaily #throwbackphoto #dessert #lavacookie #kookscreamery #love
Nearest mrt - Serangoon, but have to walk a lot la.
😍\n<br />Strawberry Cookie with Red Velvet Ice cream 🤤
White chocolate was a little sweet but not too bad for me. 😋
Awesome lava cookie, prefer this over the matcha lava cookie!
Let it flow ^^!
the \"christmas deco\" is SO CUTE
😃
Right. \n<br />Sesame ice cream over #matcha cookies which oozes out when hot meets cold. What a chemistry! \n<br />Simple yet genius. $8.50
🎈\n<br />The Signature Lava Molten Cookie ($8.50) is worth your every penny, read my post now to find out more!
Softest cookie with oozing matcha. 👍shiok! 
Love the sweet and refreshing combination😍 Super yums!😋 #burpple
Matcha was already overflowing before we plonked the ice cream on it to make it flow even more 😂
Really impressed with their thai milk tea ice cream but the speculoos ice cream was overpowered by the molten chocolate. \n<br />#sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #lavacookie #kookscreamery #icecream #burpple #burpplesg #exploresingapore #igsg #onthetable #whati8today

Matcha molten cookie with a scoop of ice cream ! Matcha lava is a little too sweet hence it didn\'t really balance off well with the ice cream. Nonetheless it\'s not too bad la! And ya, I could have taken a better photo ...

Price: $8.50\n<br />•\n<br />🚇: Serangoon •\n<br />What happen if you put ice cream and cookie together? You get your cookie ice cream. But if you put molten matcha lava cookie into the picture. It\'s a totally a whole new level! \n<br />The lava cookie was nicely executed. Not only is the outer layer crunchy, the core is also filled. You could see it oozing out when you apply pressure on it.
Fun times with the family at new Ice Cream cafe @kookscreamery in my hood.
