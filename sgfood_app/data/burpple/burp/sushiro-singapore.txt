Essentially traditional Japanese classic premium freshness - the chutoro tastes every bit its price tag, which is more Oxley Road to their signature Bara Chirashi Don\'s Woodlands Street 13. 4/5
Whilst the other counterparts deliver with familiar competence, the standout in this fishy ménage a trois is undoubtedly the marinated spicy salmon, essentially chunks of creamy, powdery, incendiary bites of pleasure. 4.1/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />P.S. This is a seasonal item, so always enquire in advance.
$12.80. Luckily i dont have to queue v long but the portion is quite small.
5 Aug\'17, Sat\n<br />Bara Chirashi Don set @ 寿司ーロSushiro (Thomson Plaza)...🍣\n<br />美味しい!!!😋
Ordered one of the populars, the Bara Chirashi Don ($12.80) and just look at that generous portion of sashimi! Sashimi and rice ratio is 1:1 and they were very thick and fresh, which literally melts in your mouth with every bite. 😱😍 
One of the nicest Chirashi Don I\'ve ever tasted because they give a generous amount of salmon and tuna which is really really really good!!! (Not even kidding) I love eating here because you can taste the freshness in every bite where the salmon melts in your mouth. Although the queue can be quite a long wait, it is definitely worth it. Sushiro is opened Daily (EXCEPT TUESDAYS) at certain timing of  (11:45am-2:15pm) and (5:45pm-9:15pm) Be sure to head down earlier to avoid disappointments! (Start queuing first) Also, all pax must be present in order to have a seat in their restaurant to enjoy this goodness. Only at Thomson Plaza!!!!
$12.80, i find this is really worth?? The slices are fresh too. The whole bowl is 👌
Tried the cheapest Bara Chirashi Don in Singapore ✔️\n<br />It\'s definitely worth it (just look at those fat chunks of sashimi 😋) but I\'d enjoy it more if there are no hints of wasabi at all. So I\'m planning to come back and enjoy it without the overpowering wasabi taste 🙂\n<br />💲: $12.80
super yummy Bara Chirashi Don!! It really melts in your mouth 😱🤤 A bowl of heavenly goodness 😋💘
Sushiro has always been my go-to for a quick fix of chirashi at a low cost! The portion is really worth it for just $12.90. But the best part of the barachirashi is truly the sauce that they marinade the fish in, it\'s sweet and just right to bring out the freshness of the fish.
At a low price point of only $12.80, this bowl of goodness definitely hits the spot in your tummy &amp; pocket so well! Thick chunks of sashimi doused in Sushiro\'s marinade atop a bed of fluffy Japanese rice. Paired with nicely grated wasabi and not forgetting the purely blissful balls of Ikura popping in your mouth, this is really worth the 40 minute wait! The fish may not be the best of the best but at this price and with very substantial chunks of fish, I don\'t think anyone can complain! Really love the salmon &amp; the ikura which goes soo well with the rice. It\'s definitely my new go-to Barachirashi spot just that it\'s a little out of the way due to its location in Thomson Plaza &amp; sadly there\'s no mekajiki in the bowl haha. Do brace yourself for the wait during peak hours but hang on in the line because a yummy bowl of fish is waiting for you!
It isn\'t unfair to say that sashimi bowl lovers would know of this one - Sushiro\'s $12.90 Chirashi. Salmon, tuna, ikura (salmon roe), amaebi (prawn), hotate (scallop) and octopus on a bed of sushi rice. The ratio of fish chunks to rice is 1:1. Unwilling to say because it is already so hyped, but yes, no wonder the queue.\n<br />💫\n<br />Slow on the bandwagon, but glad I tried - even if in a takeaway bowl, because we didn\'t have all day to join the queue of 10 people at weekend lunch. Fun fact: you can try your luck queueing for the bowl at it\'s sister shop at the same level opp the food court, but chances are, both will have snaking lines. xD Just get the takeaway bowl otherwise.
Bara Chirashi Don (12.80$) - Really awesome bowl of Sashimi. Waited for 30 mins to be seated and we got served within 5 mins! Pleasantly surprised by their service :)
While the sushi isn\'t of the best quality, it\'s still real yummy and seasoned well\n<br />⚠️ Would recommend going slightly before the opening time ~11.20am to make the first batch of seating as the queue gets really long by 11.40 or going for a late lunch ~1+\n<br />📍@sushirosingapore, Thompson Plaza #01-22/30, 301 Upper Thompson Road S574408
Lots of Salmon Roe...the bits were falling off the bowl, so should have asked for another bowl to move the fish off the bowl
Such a creative dish yet I still enjoy inari in its simplicity, with the sweet bean curd skin wrapping the seasoned sushi rice. The idea of adding the mentai is sure to satisfy mentaiko lovers though, highly recommended for those who want a mentaiko fix!!!
We arrived at 11.25am to be the first ones bc we thought the place opened at 11.30am. Turns out it opened at 11.45am but thank goodness we went early because the queues formed so quickly that we were 3rd in a line of 20 over people. Ordered the famous bars chirashi ($12.80) and tamago, salmon and inari mentai (comes in pairs, photos to follow). We paid $20 each, how worth is that? So thankful we skipped the waiting and went straight to filling our famished bellies with fresh and quality Japanese food yet light on the wallet 😛😛 will come again on days that I have time to wait around for a Japanese fix.
I love the fact that they place out these take away bowls by the cashier in the sushi showcase so just grab and go! No need to queue or wait for food and at $12.80, I\'m amazed at the thick cubes of fish I get here!\n<br />😱\n<br />Anyone else here a Sushiro fan?
Sushiro\'s Bara Chirashi Don really impressed me the other day. It came within a minute of our order, which meant that it had probably been prepared in advance, but the assorted seafood and sashimi cubes still retained a hint of coldness and freshness which was a welcome change over some other chirashi dons i\'ve had at other outlets where the sashimi was warm. Not only that, the salmon and tuna sashimi cubes were delicious and came in rather large chunks along with equally generous servings of salmon ikura roe, octopus and prawn something that may not be apparent at first due to the small size of the serving bowl. At just $12.80 nett, this is really an affordable and price-worthy bara chirashi don compared to so many others out there!! A must try, although you should be prepared to queue at least a good 20 to 30 minutes or so... #burpplesushimonth
This is the premium bowl that\'s about 20 ish?\n<br />Really fresh and it\'s overflowing w fish. While that makes it hard to eat, it\'s so satisfying! For the first time ever, I had too much raw fish for lunch!
The soft and sleek texture of the Unagi was grilled to perfect. The rice was one of the bestest there, easy to chew and grained perfectly!
The Bara Chirashi Don ($12.90) was awesome! (10/10 for price and taste!) For the Glazed Duck with Onsen Egg ($14.80), the duck wasn\'t soft enough but still tasted pretty yummy. There was a 30-45min queue when we visited today but I thought it was well worth the wait! :-)
$11.80 salmon Don! Extremely fresh salmon with the right portion of fragrant rice! I had enough salmon to finish the rice! Lunch hour wait time is about 20 - 30mins though as the seating space is limited.
$12.90 Chirashi Don! Huge chunks of fresh seafood! Soft Sticky fragrant rice decorated with seaweed! Worth every cent!
No wonder I\'ve been hearing good things about this place. The sashimi was fresh and juicy, every mouth makes my tastebuds jumping in euphoria. 😂 Goodness gracious me, this bowl was so sexy that I couldn\'t resist. I think I need another visit.
Look at the how generous the Chef has to all their customers! Do you know the bowl is full n the way they slices their sashimi on top is excellent. You can taste the freshness of their ingredients. N is pretty affordable for a nice &amp; very filling meal. Must try. The bars chirashi don is only $12.80 &amp; the salmon sushi naguri set is $9.80.
~\n<br />·\n<br />Salmon Belly Teriyaki Don - $18.8\n<br />·\n<br />Teriyaki glazed Salmon Belly on sushi rice. Sound meh but it\'s bliss in every bite! Salmon lovers can rejoice and not just indulge in their fresh salmon sashimi, but give their donburi items a try! No Regrets\n<br />·\n<br />Sushiro\n<br />寿司一口\n<br />@sushirosingapore
Comes with generous portions of octopus, prawn, salmon, salmon roe and tuna cubes on sushi rice 》 $12.80
Strangely, what should have been an appetiser arrived last, only when we were almost done with our rice bowls. Nothing to fault about its taste though—the salmon belly practically melted in the mouth, and the tamago-mentai combination never fails to please. Each order is served in twos.
Undoubtedly the claim to Sushiro\'s fame and still the most popular dish here. Fresh, chunky sashimi cubes (salmon, tuna, ikura, prawn, and octopus) generously heaped above a moist and flavourful bed of rice, at only $12.80? This is crazy worth it and good things come to those who wait—will gladly get in line for this again.
I was warned that queues form here as early as 5+. Indeed, we ended up with an hour\'s wait from 6.30pm on a Saturday, but thankfully, it was well justified by the quality &amp; portions served here. It seems that the menu has since expanded (they shifted to a bigger outlet within the same mall) to include more varieties of rice bowls, like this yellowtail version.
The premium chirashi is a definite must when you come here! Mountainous portion of chopped sashimi doused in sweet, savory saucy goodness over a bowl of vinegary grains of Japanese rice! Another must-order is the tamago mantaiko that honestly blew me away. Just a little disappointed with the quality of rice when I visited as it was overcooked till the point of mushy. (But then again, most of my other visits have really been more than awesome so it might just have been a bad day) overall, do yourself a favor and get your cheap Japanese fixes here!
So fresh and full of flavour. Given the price point vs the freshness it\'s a value for money. Even if I had to spend my valuable time q-ing, it was worth every cent 😊
This is definitely worth the q. No regrets. Will be back for more.
It\'s not hard to see why they have snaking queues. The seasoning is great and the portions are just nice for me. 😋 #burpple
Most value-for-money Bara Chirashidon that I\'ve eaten so far! Seeing these colors makes me a happy child!
Value for $$ bara chirashi don ($12.80). Ordered both premium and normal. Premium consist of 1 more prawn and a bit more filling but double the price of the original. The salmon belly teriyaki don is extremely nice! Melt in your mouth salmon belly! Yums!
Premium Kaisen Don (S$24.80)\n<br />Widespread sliced assortment of seafood on sushi rice\n<br />Available at @SushiroSingapore \n<br />The queue was not too bad, with less than 10 paxs in front of me. However of the standard of food seems to have dropped. The texture of the sushi rice was uneven with bites of undercooked rice. The marinated ikura was too salty.\n<br />|\n<br />Sushiro 寿司一口\n<br />Address 🏠 : 301 Upper Thomson Road, # 01-22/30 Thomson Plaza, Singapore 🇸🇬 574 408\n<br />Tel ☎ : 9450 1020\n<br />Open 💈 : Wed - Mon : 11.45am - 2.15pm, 5.45pm - 9.15pm\n<br />MRT 🚇 : Marymount (CC16)\n<br />Cuisine 🍽 : Japanese\n<br />Note 📝 : Water 💦 is chargeable at S$0.20.
Mentaiko salmon don!\n<br />We came primarily for the barachirashi, ordered this for my kiddo.\n<br />It\'s so delicious oh my! \n<br />Generous slab of salmon blanketed with mentaiko! My fav!\n<br />Ooo lalalaaaaa fantastic 💦💦💦
Sunday: Knew there\'d be a queue so we came at 11.30am (they open at 11.45am).. second in queue.\n<br />About 20 people were behind me in the queue when they open.\n<br />We ordered the barachirashi and duck donburi, and mentaiko salmon don..\n<br />All were tasty, esp the barachirashi, which was flawless in every aspect💯
The two humongous slabs of salmon belly - which fit the bowl as well as a Pes E soldier fits into his Primary Six uniform - were so gloriously molten that they were virtually pornographic in mouthly gratification, and so luxuriously oily that said oils were positively and literally dripping off their edges (as the corner of the picture captures). Share with a friend to avoid salmon belly saturation. 4.2/5\n<br />⠀\n<br />Sushiro has shifted from its modest food hall origins to an expanded and more \"The Sushi Bar\"-esque dining space within the same mall. Apart from its being in the pink of commercial health, Sushiro seems to have succeeded in extending its appeal beyond queue-patient youths - half the venue comprised of full families (which included even grannies) when I was there. Respect.
Hotate Mentaiyaki was good, though I felt that the generous amount of mentaiko sauce seem to overpower the taste of the fresh scallop. Still as tasty, nonetheless 😋
For those opting for more variety of fish, y\'all can choose the Premium Barachirashi Don, which is these mountain of raw fish sitting atop a bed of rice with a prawn to top it off; coupled with the stellar sauce holding all elements together. All hail Mount Thompson 🙌🏼
The Bara Chirashi Don is superb, donned with delightfully thick cubes of raw fish which are of decent quality and value for money. Head down early to avoid the snaking queue !
You can find this donburi just outside the foodcourt! The new outlet is just near the entrance of the mall. 😋
Do expect that there\'s long queue as it only opens at certain timing. Food preparation was fast. The glazed duck and the onsen egg matches so well and it was so delicious. The sliced duck was thick and very tenderly juicy. Will go back for more!
A year ago, I made my very first visit to Sushiro when it was just a tiny shop space beside an aisle that is next to Kopitiam at Thomson Plaza — it was my first time ordering their Barachirashi Don which I was pretty blown away with the quality and quantity of fish which they totally just nailed it especially for the price.
Having returned numerous times to @sushirosingapore , i can say this place is truly a gem. Well known for their Bara Chirashi dons &amp; at S$12.80, it\'s priced really well for a donburi. I cannot say the same for their other rice bowls in terms of value (Eg. slab of unagi on rice is $15.80, not ex but would rather go for bara chirashi)
🎏\n<br />•\n<br />Finally at the much Raved &amp; Hyped Sushiro for their Chirashi Don. I LOVE Chirashi Don, it\'s like meeting a long lost Lover whenever I order mine. \n<br />However, the Chirashi Don at Sushiro doesn\'t rekindle that sparkle of Love. Yes the Sashimi is fresh, Generous?? Not really actually, it\'s piled on a Mountain of Sushi Rice. Pretty Standard, nothing to Rave about. 🍣\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASTIPS💮: Order their normal Bara Chirashi Don (💵S$12.80) if you must, one can\'t beat their price for a decent Chirashi Don though. For the same price of $24 I\'d rather you next to The Sushi Bar or others. 🖖🏻

This mountain of a chirashi don is probably the cheapest you can find in Singapore. I was greedy and chose the more expensive version and ended up not being able to finish the rice. So I\'d recommend taking the $12.90 bowl and leaving the place craving for more. 
that day #burpplegotjio alert and i got these 2 darlings at 10 bucks each. totally caught by surprised the freshness of the seafood on my chirashi bowl! for that quality, even the regular price at $12.80 is very reasonable. need to go there soon again!
When it comes to Barachirashi Don that gives you quite a decent quality with a good amount of raw fish that is also value-for-money at the same time, Sushiro is where I would head to. The marinated fish is fresh and chunky, carrying a hint of savoury flavours which sits above a bed of sushi rice drenched in savoury-sweet sauce while the Ikura gives it an umami burst of flavours to enhance the entire bowl — satisfaction guaranteed at $12.80 per bowl. The Premium Barachirashi Don at $24.80 caters to those who want more variety of fish, where the entire bowl gets stacked high with a even bigger mound of marinated raw fish and a prawn sticking out at the top.
We all know that the salmon belly sashimi is a premium item in most sushi and sashimi establishments, but this bowl is just out of the world. That juicy fatty belly that melts in your mouth, with the ideal savoury taste of the teriyaki sauce. People who don\'t like raw stuff have no reason to refuse this scrumptious bowl. Whatsmore, at S$18.80, they give you a huge portion of salmon belly in your face.
It\'s been a year since Sushiro set up shop, and not much has changed aside from the menu expanding a little.
Generous portion of salmon. The salmon sushi nigiri set is damn nice too! Love the salmon mentai and the salmon aburi most! Worth every penny that I\'ve paid.
Their Premium Bara-Chirashi Don (S$24.80) really lives up to its name. A mountain full of assorted sashimi piles up the bowl of rice, making this donburi look like a mammoth-size sushi. With everything so fresh and tasty, who can actually resist? No one, as you can see from the never-ending queue of foodies. I\'m so tempted to buy another bowl of this home for dinner!
Finally decided to try the much raved premium bara chirashi don ($21.90). They were generous with the serving that is filled to the brim (huge chunks of salmon, tuna, squid, prawn, ikura etc)  tho however, the cuts of sashimi weren\'t as fresh as I thought they would be and I even found some bones on my salmon sashimi. I Guess it\'s value for money but it\'s not the best bara chirashi don I\'ve tasted. Was a tad disappointed given the fact that reviews of it were great, Guess my expectations were alil too high..
Exotic, creamy rich flavour of the Uni is just as amazing as the Otoro with every bite !
Had a craving for unagi and this satisfied my craving totally. Definitely worth the premium price as it was reasonable and worth it!
You order the premium bara chirashi don at Sushiro and you get a mountainful of sashimi! When this was served on your table, you don\'t know where to start eating from this bowl of goodness! Definitely worth the price (less than $30). The sashimi is fresh and big in chunks. And the flavouring is just nice. Albeit alittle too much for a female eater.. but should be just nice for a guy. Head down early on a weekday evening and you wont have to take a long time to get a seat!
This small little shop tucked at the back of Thomson Plaza serves value for money Japanese dishes. Their chirashi don is priced at an affordable rate of ~$12 with generous serving of fresh fish cuts and roe. The portion is slightly smaller than what is offered outside, but enough to fill your stomach. Their sushi platter looks amazing too! If you\'re not a sashimi fan, their smoked duck don is recommended. 
Really love the succulent and generous pieces of sashimi that Sushiro offers. Yes you pay more 💰 but you also get the quality your 20 bucks deserves. The only downer would be the sauce that was a little too strong and a little too generous that it was drowning the rice. \n<br />HeartyTastyWorthy: 4.5 / 4 / 4\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />#burpple #burppleSG #sgfood #instafood #sgfoodies #eatoutsg #openricesg #myfab5 #exploresingapore #sgjapfood #japfood #SGmakandiary #foodhunter #foodstagram #heartytastyworthy #hypebeast #burpproved #singaporeinsiders #whati8today #thomsonplaza #tslmakan #snapseedfood #sushiro #cozycorner #longqueues #buzzfeast #f52grams #chirashi #chirashidon
We\'ve been anticipating our visit for so long and we\'re finally here! Two of us ordered the signature Bara-chirashi don ($12.80) and were incredibly satisfied with our choice. Fresh cuts of seasoned sashimi on fluffy rice -- few other lunch options have been as wholesome and comforting, especially considering the hectic few weeks we\'ve had when meals were gradually reduced to hasty gobble-and-go affairs. A place to hit up if you want to treat yourself but not burst your budget! The highly adorable chopstick holders that greet you from your table also deserve a mention 🐻
Kaisen Don.
Arrived here at 6.20pm on a Sunday night, Not much waiting time despite reading other people\'s reviews that the wait may be long (&gt;1hr) . Got our seat within 2-5 minutes of joining the queue. Ordered this Bara Salad ($10.90) instead of the Don. Portion seems small but its quite okay. Sashimi is good for the price, cant complain! BF liked his chicken Katsu don too. \n<br />#BurppleCheapNGood
Bara-Chirashi Don ($12.80)\n<br />Assorted seafood cubes over sushi rice.\n<br />Available at @SushiroSingapore\n<br />Topup $5 for miso soup, salad and sashimi to make it a set lunch.\n<br />There\'s already a queue of 10 paxs in front of me even though it\'s before 12noon. But lucky I got a seat within 15 minutes. By the way it\'s more than 12 seats now.

Finally got to try the much raved-about bara chirashi don ($12.80) from Sushiro! The sashimi was cut into thick chunks which made each bite more substantial. Their marinade is on the slightly sweeter side, which is fine although I personally prefer it to be more savoury. It looks small, but is actually quite filling! Definitely one of the more value-for-money sashimi bowls around. 
Price: $12.80. Add $5 if you want to complete the set with miso soup, salad, and 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. The verdict is that this chirashi don is extremely value for money and I would totally visit it again if I am in the area. They gave a really generous helping of sashimi that has been pre-soaked, which was just right as it didn\'t turn out too salty. The variety of sashimi is also amazing for its price (just look at the photo)!
Treat yourself to a Premium Hokkaido Don ($38.80) with 3 thick slices of salmon belly, 1 whole hotate, some creamy uni and a handful of fresh ikura. Don\'t want to break the bank? Their basic Barashi Don ($12.90) will be equally satisfying!!
Love the fresh flavours of this! Definitely lives up to its hype.
Scary long queues during lunch but super value for money bara chirashi don. Made my day!!! 👍👍👍
This rice bowl is topped to the brim with premium quality sashimi and is definitely worth the extra paid over the normal chirashi don.
Waited 20min for a seat but finally tried this. Sauce is sweeter than Teppei\'s (which can be a bit too generous with the sodium) but I think Teppei\'s fish is marginally fresher. This was also predominantly salmon, and there wasn\'t much variety of other fish. Still, very decent value for $12.90. 
Everything we ordered from here was satisfying! The ingredients used are very fresh, and the price you pay for chirashi is worth it! I personally felt that the portion of rice to sashimi was not proportionate for the Kaisen don though, and there was too much rice. The place is also extremely small and queues are expected. We arrived at about 520pm on a weekday and were able to get the first seating. 
The set comprises of sake (salmon), maguro (tuna), mekajiki (swordfish), unagi (eel), and tamago (egg) sushi. Torching the fresh sashimi brings out stronger flavours and this was so true when I devoured the swordfish sushi. Some fragrant smokiness outside yet inside was juicy and succulent. Shiok! Others were pretty average so I\'d recommend to try its range of swordfish sashimi and sushi. 😆
Fans of sashimi of different kinds of fishes, this Kaisen Don would be the one for you! 😉 The glossy looks and succulent texture of the sashimi guarantee certain degree of freshness. While we love the variety of sashimi in this bowl, we thought the Bara Chirashi Don was more satisfying with its generous portion. 😄
Love the food at this eatery. Been eating here since they opened.
I cannot find any fault with this. A generous portion of fresh sashimi including sweet shrimps, salmon belly,scallops and prawns, all for less than $25. I tried to avoid the crowd so I went on a monday, when I was on leave. Still ended up queuing for 20 mins.
It\'s a really small eatery with about 12-14 seats? But it was worth the wait for this $12.80 worth of fresh, chunky goodness. Serving is small for big eaters but that doesn\'t mean they skim on the sashimi! 
Because of the recent craze over tarts, I thought the queue at Sushiro would not be as long like those at BAKE and Honolulu Cafe but nooooo.. Slight comforting fact: the snakey queue at least ensures that my food would be fresh, right? 😅
A bowl filled with colorful fresh rainbow cubes of plump yummy sashimi and bubble pop ikura to chase away your Monday blues! 
Pro-tip: Skip and queue and takeaway this beauty! The amount of sashimi is generous for the price, and the sauce is tangy while not being too sweet. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 highly recommend this small joint, and also try its homemade tamago (sweet egg) that is topnotch too #burpplecheapngood
Would you prefer sliced 🐟 or cubed 🐟? #weeatfish\n<br />.\n<br />Probably one of the more pocket-friendly chirashidon around. But I certainly wouldn\'t mind topping up for a mountain of raw fish.
Fresh sashimi tossed with delicious light sauce for the chirashi don. The platter of fresh salmon sushi served 2 x 3 different types of salmon sushi - a possible addition to share. \n<br />Waited around half an hour to be seated. Overall, we definitely enjoyed the dinner, and left the restaurant comfortably satisfied.
Went with a group of friends, managed to skip the queue as we came slightly earlier. The salmon aburi were great, there\'s a tinge of wasabi in them though (so remember to let them know if you are not keen it). The surprise for us was the teriyaki chicken don which was off the menu! Never knew teriyaki chicken could taste this good, especially when it\'s paired with the onsen egg :)
The Ikura Nigiri was delightful. Definitely should try this. Their Ikura is really fresh. Eat this last, you will want to retain the awesome flavors in your mouth as long as you can :D
Topped up $5 to get a meal with their Bara-Chirashi Don. Very satisfying meal. Will be back.
Not sushi rice. You got the glazed duck over the seasoned normal rice. You got that onsen egg broken into half with oozing yolk flowing into the glazed duck meat and then to the rice. And then you put it into your mouth, and then you will go like oooooh\n<br />🚇 Marymount (Exit A bus stop)\n<br />🚌 410 (stop at before Thomson Plaza)\n<br />🍣 Thomson Plaza, #01-113F \n<br />#thomsonplaza #sushiro #burpple
Fresh, succulent &amp; juicy cubes of sashimi &amp; ikura atop rice. Only downside would probably be that it tasted &amp; looked like normal grained rice, rather than Japanese short grain rice &amp; the portion was a tad bit small. But for $12.80 &amp; for all that sashimi, I guess it\'s worth it!
Fresh slabs of sashimi, unagi &amp; juicy ikura atop Japanese rice! For those who prefer slices of assorted sashimi rather than cubes, this would be the one for you! Each slab of meat is fresh, thick &amp; juicy, making it just the right portion to pair with the bowl of rice. For those with a bigger appetite, I would recommend that you get a side of sushi together with your main bowl! It\'ll definitely help fill you up. 
Glazed duck onsen egg ($14.9) sure to set you drooling ! Cut open the egg, mix it around and viola! Yummy and simple combination 👍👍!
Be there early or risk having to wait for as long as an hour! The only place you can find affordable Chirashi Don ($12.9) to satisfy your sashimi cravings!\n<br /> At a glance, they serve:\n<br />glazed duck with onsen egg ($14.90)\n<br />Chirashi salad ($10.80)\n<br />Chawanmushi ($2.80)\n<br />Kaisendon ($14.80)\n<br />Hot/Cold Green tea ($2.80)
this time we are at @sushirosingapore featuring glazed duck with onsen egg, chirashi salad and kaisendon !
15 mins after opening and the Q had formed as I was having my share. Not a surprise why there would always be one with only 12 seats capacity.\n<br />My take on this $12.80 Bara Chirashi? Yes price was low for the variety in the bowl. But portion wasn\'t that big and neither were the sashimi cube cuts. \n<br />IMO, Teppei was still more satisfying with its chunkier cubes and theirs was also tastier in seasoning.\n<br />Overall a good eat but I wouldn\'t Q more than 15 mins for this while watching others slowly eating away. #burpple
Cute.
I must be mad. Food quality definitely worth every penny but not worth time and strength stand waiting.
Here\'s a not-so-hidden gem in Thomson Plaza (I recommend making reservations, especially for lunch and dinner because the place only seats 12)! A hearty bowl of Bara Chirashi Don ($12.80) with generous, well-seasoned chunks of raw salmon, tuna (maguro) and octopus (tako), topped with ikura. The seasoning was not overly sweet or salty, and you can taste the freshness of the raw fish. Plus points for the ikura not being overly fishy too. Please also try the aburi salmon sushi ($2.80/2pcs) - totally worth the salmon overload! 
👍🏻 the ingredients are so fresh, and the portion is just right! #sgfoodie #foreverhungry #burpple will be back again, since it\'s so near my place 😏😏
For $12.50 you get a very generous serving of sashimi on rice in a perfect sashimi-to-rice ratio. Add $3 for a salad and miso soup! Btw. The tiny stall was a bit hard to locate and only seats 12. Will definitely be back!!!
Steamed upon order, the wait of 10-15 minutes was worth it! Texture was smooth and silky throughout, though I was slightly disappointed with the toppings - a slice of mushroom and a small cube of chicken. Another dish I was tempted to order was the Ikura Chawanmushi, which I will remember to get during my next visit! 
Apart from the highly raved bara chirashi don, Sushiro serves up several other sashimi dons and rice bowls. The rice bowls are filled with normal rice instead of sushi rice. This Glazed Duck with Onsen Egg is one of them! The slices of glazed duck were tender, smokey and tasty. Breaking into the onsen egg had the yolk flow all over the bed of warm rice. This had my friend licking the bowl clean! 
Be prepared to queue because word has gotten out about this hidden gem! Tucked away in a nostalgic old mall, these bowls of sushi rice might look small, but are densely packed with goodness. Fresh sashimi, generous portions, and wallet-friendly. Defying the seemingly impossible combination 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
$12.90? Oh no i forgot. \n<br />Hhahaha but the bowl of goodness is a beauty. Loving the colors! \n<br />Slightly small for my big appetite but could taste the freshness \n<br />Borderline salty for my palate but probably just right for most people \n<br />Happy to see a crowd at Thomson Plaza! (:
They offer quality food with good value that is hard to find other places that can beat them. The Chirashi Don only costs $12.90 nett and has a variety of different sashimi available. Top up $5 and you can make it a set which includes a soup, salad and salmon sashimi. \n<br />Going to be drooling over this for the next few days. 😋😋🍣
The #barachirashi is filled with well marinated chunks of fresh salmon, tuna, swordfish, prawns topped with pearls of umami salmon roe. Very friendly service too. Make a reservation or be prepared for a long wait.\n<br />($12.80)\n<br />#oishii #valueformoney #tgif #burpple
Just look at those cubes of sashimi! It\'s the most value-for-money chirashi I have ever tried, or possibly of all dons I have tried. One shouldn\'t expect the best cut of fish here but the freshness is definitely not compromised. They even add octopus and shrimp inside the don! The ratio of rice to sashimi is just nice and marination is not overpowering. Actually, in my opinion, this is the ideal marination with a balance of sweet and savoury. I\'m glad that now I have a great place to go for my Monday dinner to re-energise myself after tuition without breaking the bank 😌
Sussed out by Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua, this modest 12-seater Japanese stall in Thomson Plaza serves tasty Japanese rice bowls. The Bara Chirashi Don ($12.80) is the most value-for-money item on the menu, considering the generous heap of freshly marinated sashimi chunks. If you\'re ready to splurge, go for the Premium Bara Chirashi Don ($22.80). It comes with fatty salmon, octopus and even glass prawns! Add $5 to complete your meal with a miso soup, salad and three slices of sashimi. Reservations are highly recommended.\n<br />Avg price: $18 per person
The generous portion of the happily-sized and uber-fresh seafood cubes will leave you in a state of suspended sashimi bliss and the pearly rice-to-seafood ratio was magical. Elsewhere, the marinate was a glorious cross between Teppei Syokudo\'s legendary (albeit occasionally eagerly salty) one and sweet teriyaki sauce. Priced at only $12.80, this astonishing marvel is destined for greatness. 4.5/5
Sushi in Japan = Big slab of fresh sashimi atop a small ball of rice. 
Great place for an affordable sushi fix. Got the Kaisen don ($14.80 nett) which had a good ratio of seafood to rice. Rice had a good balance of sweetness and vinegar. The tamago mentaiyaki ($8.80) was good too. Smokey and rich mentaiko dressing with Japanese omelette which went well with the plain rice. Also had the salmon aburi mentai sushi which was disappointing as it tasted like a mouthful of sauce.  
If not because the recommendations from my foodie friends @burpple, I will never find this place. Their variety might be limited but their quality and pricing beaten most places. Highly recommend all to try.
They lightly dressed the salmon with soy sauce and Japanese sweet sauce. While chewing on the salmon, the roe kept popping in the mouth and slowly releases its savoriness. For this price, it was super worth it.
The chicken was tender and the graze of sweet soy sauce perfected it.
This unassuming neighbourhood gem displays a quiet confidence and it is fully justified - the quality on display here would likely startle you more than a porcupine napping on a hippo\'s chair.
After seeing this little hole in the wall Japanese sushi bar being repped by one of our fellow Burpplers, curiosity got the better of me and I popped over to try it.
Was brought here by an overly enthusiastic Thomson-dwelling friend of mine, who insisted that their Chirashi don is fresh and value for money. She\'s usually one to rave about run-of-the-mill catered food, but she was right this time. For $10.80, you get a decent amount of salmon coated with a marinade that\'s neither too cloying nor overpowering. And they got their liao : rice ratio right. I\'m not a sushi rice connoisseur so the bed of rice was fine by me. I guess I could always do with thicker slabs of sashimi but at 10.80 nett, I can\'t complain. Sweet waitress as well! Only downside is the squeezy quarters, so I won\'t recommend this for groups.
Checking out this new Japanese stall at Thomson Plaza that I saw on Instagram in the morning; one of the few outfits that serves marinated Bara Chirashi Don (the same style as Teppei and DSTLLRY) which caught my interest. At $12.80, it\'s definitely cheapest of the lot, and is also more affordable than a few other Don in the menu as well. The amount of raw fish included was generous for the pricing, which came in large chunks and a good variety as well (salmon, tuna, prawn, octopus, ikura etc.) while still being reasonably fresh. Taste-wise it does carry the savoury and umami flavours well; enough marination for the fish yet still able to carry its flavour, while you could taste the sweetness of the rice at the same time. While I still would prefer DSTLLRY\'s rendition, this is still something I actually quite liked, and would hit those who might find Teppei\'s being too salty and DSTLLRY\'s too saucey. Do take note the seating is limited here, with two tables of four, a table of two and four counter seats, so bear in mind when you visit.
Salmon Ikura don ($14.80) &amp; Salmon mentaiyaki don ($12.80) .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgeats #eatsg #foodiesg #sgfoodies #burpple #singapore #eat #SG #carbs #foodporn #sushi #sashimi #don #mentaiko

Essentially Yoshinoya gone Oxley Road and given a naughty, spicy zing. 3.8/5
Sushiro’s Bara-Chirashi Don | $12.80 《4/5 ⭐️》— Assorted sashimi (chunky and fresh salmon, tuna, octopus, ebi &amp; salmon roe) on rice. Reeeaaally long queue, but definitely worth the wait! 
😊 The #sashimi mountain isn\'t as much as it looks because there\'s quite a bit of #rice under it (they don\'t allow a \'less rice\' order for this), but there was enough of it to be sufficiently #satisfying for sure. Tasted quite #fresh and seemed like it was worth the price ($24.80+$3 for soup and salad)! 😍
One of the cheapest chirashi don in Singapore 🍣

#throwback to 🤤 chirashi don! Link: https://tinyurl.com/yaqff9jy
tried the Bara Chirashi Don ($12.80). They were quite generous with the servings of salmon, tuna, octopus, prawn and salmon roe. Although the sashimi was absolutely delectable and fresh, i felt that the rice wasn\'t that good. There was an overabundance of soy sauce and it kind of masked the taste of the Japanese rice. Maybe good to let customers drizzle it on their own?
Featuring the tamago and sake mentai
Never thought that I\'d like sashimi bowl until I got my first from @sushirosingapore. They definitely did not disappoint! Trust me, it\'s not overrated. Remember to make a reservation before heading over, if not join the Q! Bring me a bowl pleaseee?

The best thing is, their Bara Chirashi Don is going at $12.80 NETT. No surprise that this highly-raved and wallet-friendly dish is the most popular on the menu! If you’re not a fan of sashimi, give their Glazed Duck Don with Onsen Egg ($14.80) a go.\n<br />~\n<br />Full review at http://eatbook.sg/cafe-566/\n<br />~\n<br />Writer: @tamscratches\n<br />Photographer: @ngyiyang
$12.80 at Sushiro.
Roasted Freshwater Eel on Rice 》$15.80
Sake, Sake-Mayo Aburi, Sake Mentai 》$9.80
Theres a range of sashimi, dons, drinks and sushi sets. Bought the breaded chicken bowl and a soup and sashimi set to complete my meat and also bought a onsen egg duck bowl! The total bill was about $36 and the food is not bad. I would suggest going there if u have a budget above $15. Overall i would rate it a 7.5/10 in terms of service, quality of food, waiting time and ambience☺

Generous heap of fresh sashimi with cubes of salmon, tuna, squid, prawn and ikura 🍣✨ at Sushiro / Thomson Plaza.
There were more fish than rice, and everything was up to standard, the ingredients were fresh and well-seasoned, the rice exceeded expectations as well! Really worth the travel to the far north but do come early as there is very limited seating spaces! #burpple#burpplesg#sgfood#sushiro#chirashi#barachirashidon#japanesefood#sgfoodie#tslmakan#8dayseats#whati8today#exploresingapore#igsg#onthetable#roastedpotatopiggiessummeredition
mouthwatering bluefin fattiest tuna belly sashimi
What a steal with so much toppings ^^!
Yummy and very affordable bara-chirashi don. 
#TGIF! #burpple #foodporn #foodspotting
It would have been my preferred choice if not for its sibling barachirashi don which is less costly and is more generous with the servings of sashimi cubes
Just be prepared for about 45 minutes queue during busy hours or have entertaining company with you. .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#chirashi #japanese #asian #burpple #fromwhereistand #chill #eatoutsg #food #foodie #foodonfoot #foodphotography #foodpics #foodporn #foodspotting #instafood #nomnom #sgfood #sgfoodie #singapore #yummy #sogood #latergram #igdaily #instadaily #instafollow #instagood
The soy sauce and mirin marinade is extremely delectable thus bringing the dish to a whole new appetising level.\n<br />At $12.80, it is definitely one of the cheapest barachirashi don around and I also truly enjoyed their 1 for 1 salmon belly sashimi as well
Besides their super value for money barachirashi, this bowl of chicken katsu don that has been overshadowed is also wonderfully executed &amp; topped with an onsen egg! .\n<br />Good for those who can\'t take raw food! 🙃🙃\n<br />.\n<br />#awesome #burpple #closeshots #chickenkatsu #delicious #eeeeeeats #eatoutsg #f52grams #feedfeed #foodporn #foodgasm #foodstagram #foodphotography #igsg #igers #igdaily #instafood #instagramhub #instayum #japanesefood #nomnnomnom #onthetable #picoftheday #sgfg #sgfood #singaporeinsiders #sushiro #throwback #valueformoney #vscofood

A new contender in the scene. It differentiates itself from teppei with their unique seasoning. Chock full of #fish. You get lots of #salmon,#tuna,#octopus,#swordfish and #ikura. I wish the portion was slightly bigger though!!
Kaisendon ($14.9) fresh slices of sashimi with unagi prawns and ikura topped with seaseme seeds and wasabi ! It\'s not mentioned what\'s in the kaisendon, this will give an insight on what you\'re in for!

The chirashi don was deceny but not the best. However they do sell cheap chirashi don! \n<br />#sgfood #burpple #sgfoodies #thomsonplaza
Their Bara Chirashi Don ($12.80) is indeed value for the price with generous amount of fresh cubed sashimi, bursting salmon roe and lightly sesame oil flavoured rice. Will definitely be back to try their other items on menu soon.
really a good honest bowl of sashimi and rice at $13. darn good.
Easily one of the quality dons to have!
This brings me boundless joy for a reasonably priced bowl of around $12+
they serve onsen egg with duck at 14.90 as well! certainly doing very well with long queue.. well considering they only have space for 14 customers..
