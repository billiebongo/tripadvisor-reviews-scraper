Eggs zoey, laksa pasta, rotisserie chicken &amp; beef rendang mac and cheese 😋\n<br />-\n<br />#theassemblyground #burpple #cafesg
This is our favourite dish during our dinner that evening! The pasta was so soft that we thought it was almost like handmade. Turns out they were egg pasta. The carbonara cream was light too, so it never felt gelat. Break that yolk and mix it around with the pasta and truffle oil, lovely!\n<br />🔸🔸\n<br />Taken during a tasting.

Went as a group of 4 for dinner on a Friday night (please do make reservations as the place can get pretty crowded!!) Managed to use The Entertainer discounts at this place 😌
Had their set lunch which consisted of a soup (carrot) + main (🍗 spaghetti) + drink for 14.50+ which was pretty decent. I also got a coffee which was absolutely delicious. Will definitely be back for their coffee!
The Assembly Burger ($21)
Fresh roasted chicken thigh with house mash, grilled mushrooms and creamed spinach\n<br />Price : $ 17
Had a good flat white here - it tasted of Bourbon biscuits dipped in milk. Thoroughly enjoyable. 
Definitely not worth $7 for that size. And does not taste anything like a sticky date pudding at all. More like a cinnamon date loaf. All dry and not moist cause it was reheated in a microwave and topped sloppily with a scoop of ice cream. What a disappointment!
贪吃而已。\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />Treat for the youngest BXXCX of the family cos she ran around SG with me to collect banners (and catch pokemons) cheers to more brother-sister time.. (And spend my money) 🙄🙄🙄
What an underwhelming plate of sadness. What the monkeys nuts @theassemblyground Get your shit together! This was $18 if I am not wrong. Beef Ragout on Rosti. COME ON..... I basically paid $18 for frozen beef cubes, a slice or buttered bread, congealed \"onsen egg\" and a fried-to-a-crisp patty of potato strands that was smaller than my palm. While the sauce of the ragout was decent, it could hardly be considered good, the beef was hard, chewy, a lazily cooked dish I\'d expect from a busy home cook. The egg congealed and gelatinous in nature. Don\'t even get me started on this sad excuse of Rosti. Cannot lah guys. Don\'t cheat people like that lei. Much disappointed by subpar food for ridiculous prices.
Second time having this. They definitely have the issue of inconsistent portion sizes but I love their scrambled eggs and can never have enough of those! :)
Just before a movie, we quickly got to a place for dinner. Surprisingly, this café was quiet on a Saturday night! We enjoyed our drinks more than the food, but really nice ambience and good service (no service charge)!
Dry beef slices in between hard chewy bread, the cheese looked microwaved. Rate: 1/10 
Pizza, pasta, fries and iced choc while chillin out with friends 😛
Set lunch menu is a winner! 14.5+ for a main, soup, bread, salad and cooler. Changes every week. The pumpkin soup was delicious!
Started my day right with Assembly Brunch ($19.50)! Scrambled eggs, wiener sausage, sauteed mushrooms, potato gratin, roasted cherry tomatoes, brioche and smoked salmon. A hearty breakfast for champions! 😋
Beef cheeks that melts in your mouth! Pasta that\'s al dente swimming in savoury sauce. Yum!
Overall, taste not so bad. The texture of bread slightly soft than usual cafe served .. 
This week\'s set lunch menu : Herbs Crusted Dory Fish with Ratatouille Fondue, seem to be a pretty good choice for lunch today!
Do you know we change our set lunch menu every week? Well come on down to see what\'s on this week!
😀 While I just spent 3/4 of my Saturday out in the field 😥 Which means I need good food to reward myself (but maybe after I crash hahaha) 😂
There are two baristas\' I\'m so used to drink and make the smoothest latte I ever had. One of them is him! I\'m was so thrilled when I heard he\'s back making coffee again! Thank for always fixing my coffee need. 1 cup is never enough! Thank you my friend!
Nice Crabcake. Though its portion is a little small. Love the eggs. A little on the pricey end. Damage done:$25
Must try is the eggs zoey with well poached eggs and delicious hollandaise sauce. Coffee was smooth and simply delicious. Visit www.theaugbunnies.blogspot.com for in depth review
Massive love for those beef chunks, and of course my gudetamago, courtesy of @mokkked, who insisted on putting it in frame btw.\n<br />.\n<br />🚇 Dhoby Ghaut. 2 Handy Road, #01-21, The Cathay, Singapore 229233.
Ok lah quite worth it especially with them tender beef cubes, and with @the_entertainer241 app! 1 for 1 ERRDAY.\n<br />.\n<br />🚇 Dhoby Ghaut. 2 Handy Road, #01-21, The Cathay, Singapore 229233.
Here\'s the Mac and Bull ($17.50++): Mac and cheese, braised pork cheek and smoked bratwurst! Pretty flavorful with the meats, but the Mac and cheese on its own was pretty bland. And they had very little proteins unfortunately. 😪. Stretchy cheese is always a plus though. .\n<br />🚇 Dhoby Ghaut. 2 Handy Road, #01-21, The Cathay, Singapore 229233.
Not many establishments put effort into their toast, but they certainly did! We had The Assembly Breakfast and Rosti with Beef Ragout! 😋
[Omega 3 Scrambled Eggs FREE U.P S$15] + [Eggs Zoey S$16] in the background. Cheap dinner because I have #EntertainerApp #BuyOneGetOneFree🤗
This cuppa of green tea latte is the bomb! I can\'t wait to be back to try their iced green tea latte 》$6.50
A hearty Assembly Brunch with a combination of scrambled eggs, wiener sausage, sautéed mushrooms, potato gratin, roasted cherry tomatoes, toast and smoked salmon served on a wooden platter 》$19.50
This beats KFC Popcorn chicken! My third time here and love the ambience, lighting and definitely the food too!! A nice and cozy place to hang out with friends plus there is no service charge! 🙌🏻 
Lemon soufflé which tasted more like no-bake lemon cheesecake. It tasted good and refreshing nonetheless. 
My cuppa Matcha Latte, while trying to get some work done post-dinner, with Eleanor Tay.
I think this #workyourway hobby is getting dangerous, and not-so-friendly on the pocket too. Post-dinner offsite work with Eleanor Tay tonight, exploring yet another cafe that offers free WiFi to customers 😘
This place has such a Christmas vibe with all the fairy lights (that I adore!), but too bad their WiFi was terribly slow (nearly to the point of non-existence) so I had to do off-line projects which made tonight super unproductive. ​(¬_ ¬\")\n<br />⋅\n<br />#WorkHardAnywhere #TheAssemblyGround
Porcini Cream Pasta ($18+)
All day eggs Benny goodness! One of my favourite places to chill at - nice music w good food! 💞
The Assembly Brunch
In this buzzing environment on a Friday, it\'s pretty overwhelming for me. Ordered their The Assembly Brunch at $19.50 before gst. I will say, it tasted pretty good. The cherry tomatoes were juicy, scrambled egg was creamy, mushroom was really tasty, toast was toasted well but the smoked salmon slices and potato rosti were a bit disappointing. Given a choice, I will head down to Food for Thought for their all day breakfast instead.
First attempt on using my @the_entertainer241 and it\'s a good deal. \n<br />It\'s has been a while since I last tried this place and i have to complement that food standard has improved compared to my previous visit. \n<br />The slow- roasted Angus beef chunks were succulent and soaked up all the flavors from the sauce.
Typical English breakfast items but substantial portion and an interesting addition of potato gratin! 
First post to my favourite cafe, which is also the cafe I\'m working at (shamelessly promoting but you won\'t regret) 
Braised beef chilli con carne with fresh fettuccine topped with shaved parmesan is top notch at $17+. I love braised beef chilli con carne fries and this is the pasta version. The other pasta with spicy chicken sausage &amp; bacon is less flavorful, although there\'s more ingredients at $18+. It\'s written to contain garlic and white wine yet I couldn\'t taste them in this pasta. Also there was slightly too much chilli oil in it. I wanted to get the American duck pizza instead of this pasta however the 1 for 1 option is solely for either pasta or pizza. I always get my green tea latte fix from the assembly ground at $6.5+! Will be back on another Monday for the pizza 😋
For assembly ground, I felt that the coffee was 3.5/5. Ordered filter coffee but I didn\'t feel the aroma and sweetness as expected. Not that it\'s bad, but just that my expectation was abit high. Pasta was average. Fair value for money I guess. 
The Assembly Brunch is definitely the signature dish of the cafe. A potluck of all the goodness from the cafe. The scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, sautéed mushrooms, flavored sausage ... A perfect match together. &amp; the truffle fries, light scent of truffle dipped in mayonnaise sauce. A must for me to order whenever I saw it on the menu! 
Apart from the beef that was too tough, everything else about this dish is wonderful! Especially loved the potato rosti, soft egg, and the wilted spinach hidden beneath the yolk!
Apple tart with ice cream was yum but the chocolate cake was too sweet and rich for my taste.
The thin crust Smoked Duck Pizza from the Assembly Ground is of a decent portion size and great for sharing while the truffle fries could use more truffle oil, I never say no to straight cut fries fried to crisp perfection~
Finding this a little sweeter than I\'d like it to be.

The crust was a bit on the soft side, but loved how the apples were poached so soft and crunchy with the caramalised sweetness that is just right without being overpowering. Vanilla Ice-Cream was rather mediocre though.
A well pulled cuppa using Common Man Coffee Roaster blends. Robust body with fruity notes that is creamy and smooth to down without leaving too much aftertaste.
I had their cakes on my first visit there and it was so-so. But the winner of this place is their coffee. Awesome roast and I finished this cup of flat white in minutes! Oh, their truffle fries are spot on too!
$18+ a serving.\n<br />Smell check 👍\n<br />Appearance check 👍\n<br />Taste check 👎\n<br />It smells overwhelming of truffle oil, looks yummy, but tastes overdose of salt. The mushrooms seem not fresh as they taste sour.
All day breakfast/brunch. Not into the bread much, prefer scramble eggs to be more runny. Hotdog taste good. Comes with choice of ( smoked salmon or bacon ) Ice mocha!!! YUM YUM! with ice cream in it. Side of popcorn chicken which tasted good as well.Overall 7/10
Nice place to chill and the matcha latte was not too sweet. First time drinking matcha latte (oops) so cant really give a fair comment.. Also ordered the all day breakfast, egg was perfectly poached on well toasted bread.. came with salad side.
The Assembly brunch $19, Omega 3 scrambled eggs $14, Porcini cream $17 &amp; Battered fish bites $12.
Almost my default chill-out place in Dhoby Ghaut. And I know I can always expect a good cuppa. As for the cakes here, there are some hits and misses. Personally, I found the Earl Grey Strawberry cake too sweet for my liking, mostly due to the overly sweet sponge cake in between the strawberry earl grey cream. The strawberry flavour was pronounced, which added a lovely dimension to the dessert. And oh, where did the earl grey go??  I probably wouldn\'t order this again /:
My sweet tooth got the better of me, so I dived right into this apple tart. For one, this tart is pretty soft all around. I was expecting a slightly thicker and more crumbly base, but this one is soft, a little like bread. Apple bits were still juicy and went well with the vanilla ice cream. Overall a good dessert value-wise. 
🌼Rate: 7/10\n<br />The cream is not that strong But it taste nice tho will get abit sick of the taste But yea. The portion is big enough for me But can\'t rlly finish everything xD
🌼Rate: 6/10\n<br />Was expecting to be spicy But turn out to be non-spicy. Somehow it tasted like tomato sauce instead of chilli lmao But overall okok (Sorry for the bad quality &gt;
Right from the start when my friend and I walked in, we were served by a staff member who was a little curt to us when we wanted to sit in a bigger table (the place was half empty). Food was not spectacular either - truffle fries were soggy and the tuna fillet burger was average, though I liked the sesame brioche bun which was soft and sweet.
One of the best ice mocha served with ice cream. Taste like vanilla with milk chocolate instead of coffee. Lol  
Had a massive need to indulge in sweets so I bought myself a pound cake with green tea latte. The Thai Milk Tea Pound Cake was just dense and sweet. The milk tea element came more as a light aftertaste, which was kind of disappointing. The winner here is the Iced Green Tea Latte, comes topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream 🍦!  Comes at a Total price of $13+, and a hell lot of calories 😋
A must to order whenever I visit a cafe. Light scent of truffle dipped in home-made mayonnaise sauce.. How wrong can the truffle fries goes?! 
Tender ham with fragrant mushroom and the sunny egg yolk smacked right in the middle! Eat it while it\'s hot, you\'ll have no regrets! 
Rosti with seasoning and creamy scrambled eggs makes a perfect combination! Not forgetting the juicy sausage and crispy bacon!
Poached egg blends well with the cream pasta and mushroom which brings out a different taste! One of the cream pasta which is not so creamy! 
Scrambled egg topped up with Smoked Salmon and Multi-Grain bread
the spicy bacon and sausage pasta and omega 3 scrambled eggs, so simple yet delicious!
Heart meal, accessible location and definitely a cosy place to relax with your friends over dinner and coffee! So easy to locate because it\'s literally in The Cathay. So much love for the angus beef, ahh the thought of it makes me wanna have a second go at it soon someday. However, the truffle fries is a lil disappointing i must say. All in all, t\'was good! 
We are open as normal (11am-10pm) on New Year\'s Day so come and hang out with your loved ones! 🎉🎉 It has been a good 2014 and we look forward to serving you and feeding you more great food in 2015!
Asked for a recommendation and I got this. Sure love how strong the lemon taste is, but couldn\'t taste the lavender at all! Pretty good, but not great.
Ordered the Iced Green Tea Latte and Iced Chocolate for our drinks today at The Assembly Ground located at The Cathay (not to be confused with Assembly Coffee)! Slightly pricey at $7.50 for a tiny cup but at least it was pretty good and it even comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sprinkled with either green tea and chocolate powder respectively in each drink! 🍫🌱 #TGIF everyone and Happy Boxing Day!
The iced peppermint mocha was brilliantly crafted and topped off with a scoop of ice cream. \n<br />#FOODART #singapore #local #makan #burpple #julsmakan #eat #foodporn #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodsg #instafoodsg #igsg #assemblyground #brunch #cafehopping #sandwich #mocha
Brunch before the big wedding dinner. The iced peppermint mocha was brilliantly crafted and topped off with a scoop of ice cream.
Wakey, wakey, time to rise and shine and ogle at that egg porn. Look at it, sitting smack in the centre of the pizza, bleeding molten yellow yolk. The pizza base itself was a bit too stodgy, but the toppings, scented with truffle oil, made a can\'t-go-wrong combo. 
Went for a late dinner, can\'t remember the day. Would have preferred a meat patty instead of a minced meat patty, but not too bad, and very filing. Had a banana smoothie (if I remember correctly) that wasn\'t too sweet. Ie. Good!
Impromptu lunch date with the JC BFFs 😊
If you have a sweet tooth, dig in. You\'ll love their cakes. A tad too sweet for me. But do try their coffee, they\'re good :)
Just awesome and filling. For a hungry soul or for 2 to share. Not to forget the truffle fries.. Must have! 
Well fret not for All-Day Brunch is served here at @theassemblyground. See you!
This trio of King oyster mushrooms, Shiitake mushrooms and Button Mushrooms with truffled scented poach egg aims to hit the sweet spot of mushroom pasta lovers. Remember to check out our new menu this weekend!
We have added 10 new items for your gastronomical delight. Some culprits are The Assembly Wagyu Burger, The Porcini Cream Pasta, and The Ragout of Beef with Rosti. See ya soon!
Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some matcha powder! Cooling and refreshing drink. It tasted powdery. I guess its due to the matcha powder used to mix with water. Flavour of matcha is quite strong, i cant really taste the caffeine though.
Besides starbucks, why is it so difficult to find a good matcha drink in Singapore? 😕 Anw, The Assembly Ground review is up. Direct link in bio.
I really love the food here. And every dish is delicious! Happy non-working Friday!
After the blood test and dental checkup, I was finally able to eat a proper meal and boy did I order a feast. Beef melt sandwich served with parmesan cheese and a side salad plus a cup of flat white to start the day right!
Not a big fan of ice coffee but thanks to the hot and humid weather recently, I seriously wouldn\'t dream of anything aside from this! The cafe latte swirls in vanilla ice cream has created a beautiful blend, with each element coming through smoothly and no one overwhelming each other.
Friday night din at Assembly Ground, opened by the people behind Benjamin Barker. Pull pork pizza was excellent and the eggs benny was done the right way with flowy.
Got the flat white, no complains. This place has free wifi and provides some peace in the bustling city area.
Straight cut fries with Parmesan truffle oil and tartar sauce served in a mess tin. 
Pretty decent brunch - portion was rather small but it was understandable given the ambience and location
Pretty decent pound cake - moist and strong tea flavors to it but just a tad too sweet.
Great service here. They don\'t chase you out once you finish and the cafe is really spacious. Good for catch-ups. Decent food here too, but don\'t order the rosti omelette for the rosti. The texture was a little weird and it reminded me of crispy noodles. The Truffle shoestring fries are a must-order. Fluffy inside and full of truffle aroma. Skip the too-sweet Earl Grey Tea Cake and get the better Thai Milk Tea cake instead. I\'ll be back for their Gula Melaka cake and coffee (:
Salted caramel cake / Thai tea cake / Iced green tea latte / Iced latte ($25.40 in total) I like the taste of the cake but not the density, too dense for my liking. Drinks wise were good 😄
Desserts always welcomed! But this earl grey citrus was way too sweet for my liking. Wouldn\'t recommend it! Latte was well balanced and milky while the green tea latte was super rich (a little grainy and bitter). Their cracker like thin crust pizzas weren\'t too bad too.
Love the ambience, the food and service! Explains why I\'m back again for more! 👍
Pretty standard brunch staples here. Truffle fries and big breakfast did not impress. Matcha latte was good, and slightly cheaper than the other cafes ($5.50). Friendly staff and great service though! Will come back for a drink and to have a Gula Melaka cake because Maple &amp; Market is just too far. 
Salted caramel cake $7.90 ($8.45 w GST) Cappuccino $5.00 ($5.35 w GST) Americano $5.00($5.35 w GST). Pretty decent coffee and cake.
Assembly Ground next to Assembly Store. So now you have a place to take a break after shopping. Or a place to wait for your partner/ friend while they are shopping next door. The coffee is good! And all iced drinks comes with a scoop of ice cream - Yippy!  Food can be better to ensure a fulfilling meal! 
Of course, what is a meal without truffle fries! Hehe. A portion good for 2 to share ($10), this was a tad bit of disappointment. We were expecting a wave of truffle smell when the fries arrived but there was none. Only a slight bit of it was tasted on some sticks of fries, however, the sauce did make up for it. 
Finally got the chance to try out this new ground &amp; I must say, it met my expectations! This plate of beef chilli is just right with that tinge of spiciness, the beef chunks could have been bigger instead of just minced beef. Nonetheless, good first experience! 
On a side note just wanna wish this girl a very happy birthday! @dawnowlette
Just chilling at this new cafe at The Cathay. Happy weekend! 
The bread that comes with it has seeds on them to give that crunch #burpple
A scoop of vanilla ice cream to make it milky and so yummy! #burpple
An extension of the assembly store of a multi label retail stores that brings in intentional fashion &amp; lifestyle. Assembly Ground is an open concept cafe with a spacious dining space, food and drinks was really sincere and generous at it\'s affordable price as well as friendly service was received!
Something getting more hyped up, green tea latte has became alittle more fusion. It was the best invention on earth. Matcha was one thing I can die for, but unfortunately this cuppa gets alittle too powdery after each sip. It feels like, I\'m having a cup of green powder 😏
that\'s not my hand, if you\'re wondering 😛
Really good truffles fries and coffee!My friends complimented the green tea latte which interestingly comes with a scoop of ice cream!
Truffle fries, anyone? 🍟 Not all fries infused with truffle oil thou\' fries are crispy. I prefer a stronger, earthy flavour.. And so far, only 2 places make the mark IMHO. 🙊🙊
Thin crust pizza with ham, sautéed mushrooms, egg &amp; truffle oil. Am a fan of thin crust pizza but the pizza here didn\'t really make the mark. Pretty normal I would say. The crust, though crispy, taste somewhat like naan than pizza crust. Can\'t taste the truffle oil. 
One of the newer cafes in town which serves really good #coffee! ☕️
Pulled pork 🍕 is really tasty! And loving the thin crust as well
An interesting combination of coffee, food and beer on the side, combined with the the Assembly Store retail experience next door with very cool designed clothes and bags.
Loved this pound cake - moist enough, lavender fragrance balanced with a tinge of mild sourness from the citrus.
Iced Mocha was to my liking. Truffle fries was quite decent and so were the other brunch dishes. Potentially up my top 5 cafés so far! 
a cake that\'s really a huge brownie with smaller brownie cubes on it and chocolate cream, and a really great combination of vanilla ice cream with rich green tea
Dinner last weekend.
Eggs Zoey (S$17) - Of poached eggs, smoked salmon, hollandaise, herbs &amp; muffin. Pretty normal I would say. 
They are generous w the cheese and I was so glad the cheese did not taste overpowering or appear to be too dry (which I will get sick of it). Portion is just right for any meal of the day and food came really fast altho it was almost full house when we placed our order. The Assembly Ground is located at The Cathay. 
For eggs benny and smoked salmon lovers you gotta have this. Smoked salmon is not overly salty and the bread was soft, chewy and can be easily sliced. Note that the hollandaise sauce was a little tangy tho. 
I emphasize, I am NOT guilty of this Egg Porn, but it\'s quite tummy-growling inducing.
Great place to chill! Love the banana maple caramel cake! 
Sounds like a combo tat could never go wrong however the only thing to wow about is how crispy the bread is, the filling of roast beef cheese and caramelised onions is almost near tasteless....😱😱
The first cafe that cheered me up considerably for always missing out on latte art just because I prefer my coffee cold. All ice milk drinks come with ice cream and look sooo good!
Cos that\'s when we re-open for the week again! We are open 12-10 today. #sgfood #sgcafe #theassemblyground
Did not particularly enjoyed the Baked Eggs here. While the Shasuka is spicy enough and there are quite a good amount of lamb sausages, it was a wee bit gamey and the eggs were too well done. The toast was also rather uninspiring as it seemed to come off from supermarket loaves.
The Rosti is hidden under the omelette here, which seems to have much of its taste taken by the fried egg. It\'s not exactly nasty, but it just did not hit my tastebuds
Think Bundt cake fused with Cinnamon Roll for this cake; the cream cheese frosting matched the cake perfectly, along with toasted pecans on the top for a tinge of nuttiness. Swirls of crunchy cinnamon bits are inside the cake to provide the Cinnamon Bun-like touch, which compliments the Bundt perfectly.
The Assembly Ground serves blends from two roasters; one from Common Man Coffee Roasters and another from Nylon Coffee Roasters. There is also a choice of getting a single espresso shot or a double espresso shot. The signature flavour profile of Common Man\'s blend shines here; full body and high in acidity. 
New cafe in the Cathay. Assembly Grounds. They serve all day brunch and coffee is good!
It was so crunchy and juicy, I finished everything Super fast.\n<br />I am so damn hungry right now it\'s unreal 😣😣😣
maybe i expected too much? anyways, i was disappointed they didn’t allow me to change my fries to something else like the Creamy Spinach (ordered as an additional side dish instead, as seen in the background) or Sautéed Mushrooms, even though i was willing to top-up money for it. okay, i know it’s not a given that restaurants do that for us but it will be good if they can sometimes be a little more flexible? they did change my fries to more ‘salad’ but seriously, i don’t think ‘salads’ should mean some greens with balsamic vinegar 🤨 \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia @burpple #burpple @chopesg #chopesg #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #singaporeeats #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgcafefood @cafehoppingsg @singaporeeats @theassemblyground #theassemblyground #southernfriedchicken #friedchicken

An aglio olio tossed in haebeehiam (dried sambal shrimp). Garnished with squids, clams and prawns.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Interesting take on east meets west fusion. Pasta a tad under. Liked the seafood as it was cooked to my preferred doneness. A tinge of spicyness. However, it is alittle dry. Lacks the moisture or not enough of olive oil. ◾◾\n<br />A newly refurbished The Assembly Ground. Cafe is much much brighter.

Chicken was nicely roasted and tender.. And as you slice through the meat with your teeth, u can feel that it\'s still very warm and fresh!. Although it does look like one of the popular items, it\'s actually rather ordinary. It\'s taste is somehow familiar. Perhaps more sauce would be good? 😯Luckily the sides are quite refreshing as it came with a slightly rich milky mash potato, grilled mushrooms and their version of creamed spinach.\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#theassemblyground#rotisseriechicken#chicken#thecathay#roastedchicken#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending
The batter is lightly seasoned  with smooth and flakey chunks of meat underneath. It\'s definitely a better than average F&amp;C but the magic happens when you dipped the fish into their gribiche sauce. This \'mayo/sour cream like\' sauce certainly compliments the fish and the other sides. At $16.50, it\'s one of the lower costing meals on their dinner menu and I certainly wouldn\'t mind having this if im back here again..😊\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />🔹\n<br />#theassemblyground#fishandchips#fish#thecathay#fishnchips#cafesg#cafe#foodie#eatsg#delicious#singapore#singaporefood#sgfoodporn#sgfoodie#sgfood#foodsg#foodporn#whatissingapore#instasg#foodpics#foodgasm#instasg#sgfoodies#openrice#hungrygowhere#burpple#burpplesg#sgmakandiary#uncagestreetfood#stfoodtrending

Wondering (with @yuan_yuan96 and @liangchenggg) what we were doing in the middle of Orchard 12 hours before school starts, and feeling extremely guilty for pangsehing @hyunwoo97 the day before.
The beef is surprisingly cooked perfectly! Will definitely be back!
Returned to assembly ground for a rainy weekend brunch. Had the beef ragout and personally thought the crispy rosti was the stand out. Always felt the food here was a tad pricey so luckily had the entertainer with me the second time here.\n<br />#sgfoodie #sgfood #sgcafe #entertainerapp #entertainer #sgcafehopping #brunch #burpple
Tender stewed beef chunks with mushrooms. A good option for brunch, especially with the crispy rosti and with the extra touch of the egg. #burpple  #BurppleSG #eggs #breakfast #brioche #cafehoppingsg #foodieSG #foodgasm #whati8today #sgfood #sgfoodies #instafood_sg #sgmakandiary #nomnomsg #sgeats #sgcafefood #cafesg #onthetable #sgfoodie #igsgfoodies

I\'m sure coming back for this -M
Can\'t imagine the potency of the double shot. 😂
Rather small portion.. But I really like the way the eggs were cooked, it\'s so runny on the inside. Always felt that salmon is a heavenly match with hollandaise sauce and dill leaves. Made my evening so contented. \n<br />#eggsbenedict #eggsbenny #salmon #assemblyground #theassemblyground #eatlocal #foodporn #eatsg #hollandaise #hollandaisesauce #burrple

The flat white\'s pretty ok, but on the expensive side.

1 for 1 pizza/pasta on Monday afternoon! Total bill came to $20+ for 2 pizzas. The thin crust pizzas taste quite like stale Polar\'s puff pastry, which I found rather strange. The ham, mushroom and eggs pizza had a slight hint of truffle that went well with the cheese but it can get quite jelat after a few slices. The American duck pizza was less cheesy, with a strange floral scent to the shaved Parmesan. There were only a few thin slices of smoked duck breast and somewhat tough duck bacon bits. The arugula was a nice touch. I personally preferred the ham and cheese pizza. Mocha was good but got a bit bitter towards the end.

Super crispy at every bite even after a few hours with a generous sprinkling of cheese on each fry. Perfect with the dip that comes along with the fries and the truffle taste was just right for me! \n<br />Between 2 of us, we almost polished off the entire thing. Definitely worth the carbs and price of $11.50 - great for sharing!
Kitchen would be closed from 4pm - 6pm, with appetizers, sandwiches, cakes and beverages only available. See ya soon!
Hmm.. #foodporn #theassemblyground #burpple

Didn\'t check where the beans were from, but the taste was super familiar! You have a choice of either one shot or two &amp; since it\'s the evening, one shot ($5) would suffice. Smooth &amp; creamy, this barista knows his coffee. 
Break aft a whole nite of work! 
Carbonara pasta 😍😍😍
Hearty brunch to start the long weekend! 😋 #burpple

Life\'s too short to drink lackluster coffee.
🍰 Banana caramel cake: nice but it starts to get \"sick\" and too creamy at the end.
Delicious creamy latte
