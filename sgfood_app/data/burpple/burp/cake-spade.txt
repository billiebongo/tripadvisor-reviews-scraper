Tried their chocolate cake which is not soft in texture and a bit too sweet for me. A bit too much and too filling for me after dinner.
This cake is so light, the soft smooth durian mousse with light fluffy sponge results in a texture that I really love.\n<br />🔸\n<br />Despite the light vanilla sponge and mousse, taste and smell of durian is still distinctive. You won\'t see the durian fibres here, so for some it may not feel as \"authentic\" nor value for money, but for me that resulted in a seamless texture fitting for their rendition.
Unfortunately, the rich, creamy, pungent flesh and that ohsoshiok feeling (you get when you eat MSW durians) is completely non existent. There durian filling (though generous) had a very mild taste to it. A pity because the sponge cake and cream were excellent. Perhaps I should have stuck to my regular flavors - the Hummingbird cake and the Spiced Carrot cake. #burpple #cakespadesg
🍴Knew cake spade since it\'s starting days operating out of the tiny shop &amp; been in love with their tofu cheesecake (&amp; other cakes) since then. Really love that the cake is not overly sweet or cheesy ⭐️ 4.5/5 ⭐️\n<br />📍@cakespadesg, 83 Tanjong Pagar Road, S088504
Claimed to be their Store Special (for this festive season I guess), this sundae (S$9.80) packs a combination of chocolate, caramel, cookies and nuts. It contains ice creams of chocolate, caramels and vanilla flavours, decorated with crushed Oreos and Speculoos, chocolate and caramel sauce and a chocolate coated cherry.
❣️\n<br />The latter tasted better with smooth creamy texture which doesn\'t make you feel jelat even if I finished the whole slice on my own. \n<br />As for the red velvet cake, it just tasted ordinary.\n<br />❣️\n<br />-\n<br />❣️Cake Spade\n<br />83 Tanjong Pager Road\n<br />Singapore 088504\n<br />Tel: 64443868\n<br />Mon to Sat 12noon - 9.30pm\n<br />(Closed Sun/PH)
Love the cheeky banana slices sandwiched between two cake layers, which cuts through the richness of the rich chocolate frosting. Definitely one made for sharing!
Chocolate Fudge Cake, Ovaltine Chocolate Crunch, Chocolate Ganache, Meringue Icing with Digestive Cookie Bits &amp; Chocolate Rasps Topping 》$7.80 / Slice
Unbaked Cheesecake, Strawberry Jelly, Fresh Strawberries &amp; Digestive Cookie Crust​ 》$6.50 / Slice
Once again my all time fav dessert places !! Bought a speculous brownie ?? ($4.90) , a lemon tart ($7.60) and 2 yuzu matcha honey drinks☺️ The brownie and tart were alright, ( one is a little too dense while one is light with a strong lemon flavour ) However, their other cakes are amazing and the drink is the best in my opinion😍 definitely a 9.5/10 for the ambience, the food, the drinks and the staff were friendly too!! recommended to all hehe☺️👍🏻
However, this Lemon Meringue Tart ($7.50) could have been much stellar if the tart crust is more buttery. The lemon curd was tangy and meringue added a nice touch but was fallen short by the tart. Think I should just stick with their strawberry tofu cheesecake in future, which is always a sure-win.\n<br />•\n<br />Cake Spade\n<br />Address: 83, Tanjong Pagar Road, Singapore 088504 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #cakespade #cakespadesg
One of their most popular cake, the peach is chunky but soft and sweet with a smooth and melty tofu cheesecake as its base, contrasted by the texture of crumbly digestive biscuit at the bottom.
29-SEP-16\n<br />♡ Silky texture and the cheese is not too overpowering!\n<br />☆ $6.50 nett
Finally back after a brief hiatus for exams, and first stop is to satisfy major cake cravings! Here we have the humming bird cake, strawberry tofu cheese cake and carrot cake. I have got to say my favourite was the hummingbird cake. Not overly sweet, with just enough buttercream and adequate amounts of pineapple stuffed within moist cake. And chopped pecans!!! The strawberry tofu was slightly overpowered by the actual strawberries inside the jelly but the jelly cheesecake was really lovely! Lastly, the carrot cake was good by itself, but the orange buttercream just got too cloying and over powering. Can\'t wait to try more of their cakes! 😍
Possibly my new favourite cake! Love that it\'s cheesy yet light on the palate
Dark chocolate with Banana cake, $7.30.\n<br />Spectuloos cheesecake, $7.30.
This was huge but one can finish because it\'s mostly whip cream. Love the fact that they had some Oreos in the shake itself. At the side, I had a passionfruit cake and lemon tart. Those were good because they were slightly tart so it complemented well with the sweet chocolate. Will definitely go back to try other cakes but will give the shakes a miss. 
What\'s a girls\' day out without pretty cakes? Picked Pomegranate Red Velvet, Peach Tofu Cheesecake &amp; Lemon Meringue Tart - all really lovely cakes, except we felt the red velvet was a tad too dense.
What a surprise! Out of all the lemon tarts I have tasted, this $7.50 lemon tart was the most spite yet sweet!! 💟 The crust was actually quite moist and not crispy which was a little downer for me ( I LOVE CRISPY CRUST) but the CREAM did all the good stuff in my mouth the crust was just no problem! 👌🏼 When you feel like a sour touch to your dessert, come here. They\'ve got some good lemons that hurt so good💕💖
Glad that they\'re now bigger and better with more cake selections yay! Here\'s featuring their all-time favourite {Strawberry Tofu Cheesecake} and their relatively new {Speculoos Cookie Crumble Bar}! 😋😍
Tangy passionfruit curd pipped between vanilla angelfood cake and covered in toasted meringue icing.
Their yummy signature Red velvet cheese cake sitting on chunks of oreo cookie milk shake with marshmellow sticking on the side with nutella spread. Sinfully.
love the chocolate cream layer..the cake layers are not moist enough for me. alright cake
The cake has a rich taste and the ambience was great on a weekday afternoon, half filled and there were many cakes available; price is normal which is around $7 
😉🎂 Enjoyed a wonderful afternoon with the awesome mermaid girl @thesteampunkmermaid 😜
At old outlet they are always sold out. Note that they are only available on some chosen days and timing only (tue-fri 5.30pm onwards, sat 1.30pm onwards). I have sweet tooth yet also don\'t like super ultra sweet kind. The shake was super yummy, dark chocolate kind. Only feel a bit too much creams, remove and very enjoy the whole package. Worth the price tag ($14.90). Strawberry tofu cake is abit pricey but ($6.50) is on our fav list. #cake #milkshakes #cakeshake #dessert #sgfood #burpple #igsg
All-American cheesecake, Speculoos cookie crust, caramel cookie bits topping and caramel drizzle. Love the dense texture of the cheesecake with enhanced sweetness from the caramel cookie. @cakespadesg
Finally able to try the very highly raved Unicone Cakeshake ($14.90), which was Vanilla Milkshake in a mug lined with Strawberry Sauce inside and Nutella with sprinkles outside, topped off with a slice of Red Velvet cake, Old School Wafers, Whipped Cream, Grape Wafer Biscuits, and last but not least, a cone with cotton candy on top. That sure is a whole load of calories! 😱 The toppings overall were really sweet and there was nothing to balance out the sweetness. The milkshake was also sweet, which makes this whole milkshake a very sweet treat (a little too sweet), but the consistency of the shake was thick, which was a good thing.
Their white chocolate blackforest came to being a surprise. Flavourful, aromatic and less sweet. Suitable for a sweet tooth who loves chocolate!
.\n<br />A spin-off from the usual cake offerings, they now have softserve with cakes dunked within too. Perfect dessert for the humid evening.
A tad expensive but a really good cup of coffee. When asked what beans it is, the staff would only reveal it\'s a local brand...
Tried the Lemon Meringue Tart, SGD 7.50 Nett (Featured) and the Seasonally Available Tofu Cheese Cake, SGD 6.50 Nett (Not featured).
A caramel ice cream that has delicious chopped macadamia nuts in every mouthful. Sweet but not overly so, it\'s enjoyable although it does get a little rich towards the end. Overall a lovely ice cream though I would have preferred it be have more hints of saltiness.
Cake Spade is famous for their strawberry tofu cheese cake but because the mango version is seasonally available only on April-May, I chose the Mango. The tofu cheese cake is light and smooth with a sweetness level that is right on point. Biscuit crust is also not bad and my only complain is about the mango jelly. The mango slices in the jelly is sourish and too tough (perhaps not ripe enough), so much so that I find it hard to cut through the jelly with my metal fork. And this is in-spite the mango being in season.  
.\n<br />A much more spacious place, air-conditioned and pretty table tops with natural lighting.\n<br />.\n<br />As a fan of their cakes and watched how the shop grew slowly and adding more cake selections over the past three years, the day has finally come for me to rejoice for I no longer have to endure eating cakes at 30 degrees celsius.
Finally had a chance to try the cakes here and it was delicious. Ordered a speculoos cookie butter cheesecake and a peach cheesecake worth $6-7 each. Ordered a matcha yuzu drink as well☺️ the cakes were nice and the drink suprisingly was super delicious for a $6+. Never knew that matcha matched so nicely with yuzu. It is very refreshing and a must to try!! Overall is a 9/10 as the atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly☺️ would come again in my freetime.
Lovely &amp; cozy place for a coffee stop in Tanjong Pagar. Good variety of cakes on display. Place was quite busy when I visited in the afternoon on a Tuesday. I tried the Victoria Sponge Cake, and while it was not too bad, I found the cake to be a bit dense and sweet. The coffee was lovely, though.

Tried the new item, Pistachio Banana Bundt Cake with Vanilla Soft Serve 🍦($3 each with a cake purchase, u.p. $6.90). This cup of sweet treat indeed satisfy my sweet tooth. 😬
Decided to try one of their cakes every visit, plus strawberry tofu cheese cake as the must-order
The jelly-like cheese on a digestive crust is topped with a beautiful layer of strawberry jelly. #burpple
Catch up over cake with one of my girlfriends! Two thumbs up for the cakes at cake spade // Not just pretty to look at, nice to nibble with a fork over legit conversations too #throwback #treatyourself #coztoday\'srlymundane 
Delicious, hearty, unpretentious. With all the fancy entremets and elaborate layered ones, it\'s not often one finds a simple good ol\' sponge cake. My all-time faves are the Hummingbird and Spiced Carrot Cake. Of this round of takeouts, I fell in love with the Speculoos Cheesecake (it has mounds of cookie dough in it?!), and the Smores (a tad sweet but so so fudgy).
$16.90 for Matcha Azuki Cakeshake! It\'s REALLY sweet and the whip cream inside made me feel really GER-LAT. The only way to finish this is to share, sharing is caring!
Awesome carrot cake form cake spade! The cake is creamy and luxurious. The walnuts are in small chunks so they aren\'t intrusive unlike other carrot cakes!
It is hard to find nice dessert around CBD area. Managed to find this dessert shop, \"cake spade\" along tanjong pagar area. The cakes are fast selling and have much variety. We order butterscotch cheesecake, nutella crumble &amp; cup of latte. The cakes &amp; crumble never fails to disappointed us. The sweetness is just right and the cake goes well with its specialise combination. It is indeed a good choice for a bad day at work or having sucky mood.

The pretty colours! *_*
This red velvet was sufficiently moist, had a rich cocoa taste that I liked and wasn\'t too sweet. In terms of texture, it fell into the medium-dense category. The cream which was lusciously thick, complemented it well. Adding a touch of juiciness were the pomegranate seeds.
Rodeo is a cookies and cream milkshake topped with red velvet cake and furnished using torched marshmallows and oreo cookies. While all that sugar seemed overwhelming, @cakespadesg \'s rendition turned out to be surprisingly not very sweet. 😏
Visually stunning and instagram-worthy, Cake Spade\'s Cakeshakes are truly like a masterpiece. I will gladly forfeit my lunch and dinner for them as I doubt I can eat much if I was to finish drinking the entire mug all by myself.
I was disappointed that they only have Unicone Cake Shake [$14.90] left as it was just 8pm! They start serving this delectable dessert from 530pm on weekdays and 130pm on weekends.
Not really sure what\'s the appeal of this. Essentially an ice cream milkshake, this is unfortunately mostly form over substance. While really spectacular to look at, the individual components aren\'t particularly tasty on its own, which is basically the only way to eat it. For instance, the wafers and ice cream are exactly that, and the cotton candy is, well, cotton candy! The slice of red velvet cake wasn\'t that great either. While I must admit it was really pretty to look at, the excitement stops there cause you will soon realise that there isn\'t much more to this than its pretty exterior. The steep price tag didn\'t help either. Priced at $14.90
The milkshake itself tasted like chocolate milk, which was rather disappointing. Would i order this again? No. 
in need of some sweet &amp; beautiful desserts to brighten up the mood. Mudslide Dark Chocolate Cakeshake is the best choice as I love chocolate!! 😄
$58 for a whole cake. The chocolate was rich. Pure indulgence. And the pieces of bananas were embedded in the rich chocolate mousse working wonderfully to balance one\'s tastebuds. They were ripe but not mushy and not overly sweet. We loved this!
Thick tasty matcha ice cream milkshake stacked with a slice of Matcha Goma Cake, Azuki red beans, dark chocolate wafers and golden cornflakes rimmed around the mug using Nutella. The shake isn\'t overwhelmingly sweet but if you’re planning on tasting ALL flavours, be sure to bring plenty of friends like what I did so you can share them around. Pls note that this is only available on mon to fri from 5pm and sat from 1.30pm.
All the cake shakes were sold out! Managed to have this warm crumble with dark chocolate ice cream. For someone with a sweet tooth it\'s definitely worth a try. All the cakes were sold out by 8pm! Do be there early to avoid disappointment!
The strawberry tofu cheesecake was soft and the taste of the cheese was light, not so overpowering like some cheesecake would taste like (Now I know why the tofu cheesecake is a best seller) Top with the jelly encased strawberry layer, it gives an additional texture to the cake within a bite. The unicone cakeshake was so pretty 😍😍 Totally instagram-worthy with the fluffy cotton candy and the colourful sprinkles. Our cakeshake comes with a small piece of red velvet cake and waffle sticks. Like it\'s appearance, the vanilla milkshake taste a tad sweet but other than that there isn\'t any \'surprise\' element. If I\'m back here, I probably won\'t go for it again but I might try another flavour. Prolly the mudslide cakeshake?
Because of the name of this drink,\n<br />Which sounds like unicorn.\n<br />And the pretty colours.
It’s obvious that they’ve been put together with great care and quality ingredient. I still preferred the Matacha Azuki cake shake &amp; Unicone cake shake but let\'s be honest, who would say no to this pretty cake shake too? Pls note that this is only available on mon to fri from 5pm and sat from 1.30pm.

It is so pretty and over the top that immediately bring me back to candyland! I just had to take a photo of it before eating it!

The current photogenic item that one is bound to try is CAKESHAKE! At Cake Spade you can choose the flavours available at the moment: Mudslide, Matcha and Unicone. We decided to go with Unicone Cakeshake ($14.90) that is Vanilla base topped with a slice of delicious Red Velvet cake, angel floss on sprinkle coated cone and what most of us might had seen when young: the colourful biscuit Piring. They even coat the glass with Nutella sauce plus rainbow sprinkles that complete the shake and give it a magical touch. One almost can\'t bear to drink it!
Mudslide Milkshake - chocolate cake , popcorn , wafer stick , Oreo and caramel drizzle $14.90

Now \"Cake Spade\" had newly introduced their take on milkshakes that deserved some attention 3 days ago! Cold and creamy dark chocolate ice cream milkshake, with slatherings of Nutella and crushed Oreo cookie bits, stacked with their popular Chocolate Blackout cake and lastly crowned with toasted marshmallows and salted caramel popcorn. Apparently a good milkshake will bring all the boys AND the girls to one\'s yard! It is rich and surprisingly is not overly sweet. This dark beauty is definitely a guilty pleasure with its ridiculously indulgent nature and instagram worthy! Pls note that this is only available on mon to fri from 5pm and sat from 1.30pm.
We have to op for the cupcake as the red velvet cheesecake was sold out. The crimson-hued treat is dense and not-too-sweet. Topped with lovely swirls of cream cheese frosting.
Moist &amp; unique flavour of bananas, pineapples, coconut and a perfume of cloying sweetness. For sweet tooth lover,  you\'ll hum with delight in every bite!
This was perfect, not too sweet and lighter texture. Adorned with fresh strawberries encased in jelly. It won my heart. ❤
but really wanted to try @cakespadesg! this tofu #cheesecake was not bad but damn, after @twobakerssg yesterday, desserts are never going to be the same again..... @kassanatan lol #burpple
I love chocolate and I love this because it\'s sooooo very good.
The fragrance of matcha was just nice and it\'s not overly sweet.
I\'ve tried so many cake stores, and while they weren\'t always disappointing something was always off. The frosting was too sweet, the sponge\'s not good, or the flavour\'s lacking. And to a baker, if a cake isn\'t highly impressive it ain\'t worth having. 
Too many beautiful cake to choose from:/ didn\'t know what to choose haha! It\'s a little too sweet for my liking. Take away cause the cafe has limited seats
And blessed Mother\'s Day to all mummies out there 🙆🏻 #mothersday
The Strawberry Tofu Cheesecake ($5.90) is definitely a must-eat at Cake Spade. I’m not a fan of cheesecake because of the ‘gelat’ feeling after consumption. However, the Strawberry Tofu Cheesecake proved me wrong. The top layer of jelly and strawberries neutralised impeccably well with the light tofu cheesecake and cookie crust at the bottom.

Where: Cake Spade, Orchid Hotel, Tanjong Pagar\n<br />What: Nutella oatmeal brownie with ice cream\n<br />Price: 7.50SGD
Very refreshing strawberry jelly with cheesecake and biscuit bottom! One of my fav cheesecake in SG 😄😘
One of the best cheesecakes I\'ve had. Skip the strawberry tofu cheesecake, this is way better!!!
Probably one of my favourite chocolate banana cake around. Moist, rich chocolatey with a layer of mousse and bananaaaaa, not too sweet, I\'d have gladly finished it by myself. But I had to share so that was the sad part😂
Tofu cheesecake again! Light and yummy. But yep jelly melts real fast and base wasn\'t as fragrant today.
[$8.10] The warmed brownie went really well with that huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Vanilla icecream was not too sweet which is good because the brownie is quite sweet already. Centre of the brownie was gooey (Speculoos sauce) and i loved it. The brownie might look small but I thought the portion was just right because its quite sweet and too big a brownie might kill the dessert. Pretty satisfying overall!
No idea why the Cake Spade geotag isn\'t showing up, but I\'m pretty sure most of you would recognise this signature of theirs.
A daring creation by Cake Spade to introduce Hae Bee Hiam in cookies. This is a twist to our local favorite spicy mini prawn rolls. Savor Hae Bee Hiam in the cookies baked with an aromatic mix of fresh spices and dried prawns. I gotta admit that these eggless Shrimp Floss Cookies ($8.80/bag 160g) are simply addictive and incredibly versatile, I could not keep my hands off those savoury nibbles. Available for sale till 18th February 2015.
berry kinda day
The orange peel evokes memories of the yearly spammage of Mandarin oranges, whilst the buttercream kisses with a faint wisp of beer breath. 3.4/5
The tofu content makes this cheesecake more light than usual cheesecakes. The strawberry jelly was not too tart. 
Name is enough to make you drool
Having read great reviews about the strawberry tofu cheesecake and spiced carrot cake, I ordered them both to try along with the chocolate blackout cake. Of the 3, I probably liked the chocolate best. It was moist enough, dense, and very chocolatey without being sweet, and most importantly, it didn\'t taste of cheap butter unlike some other chocolate cakes elsewhere. The cheesecake alone was very light, maybe even too bland, but together with the graham crust and sweet jelly layer it was pretty delightful. The carrot cake was least pleasing as it sorely lacking in flavour, and personally I wished there had been some chopped walnuts added in to give some crunch and nuttiness. 
One more.
Awesome cakes and desserts. The Strawberry Tofu Cheesecake ($5.90) was light and had a nice graham cracker base, completed with a unique jello texture. The Spiced Carrot Cake ($5.90) has the right balance of spices and a tasty cream-cheese frosting.  
$5.90/ slice, nice texture and slight salty taste. I loved it....
I love bread&amp; butter pudding so I had to get this (Nutella was a bonus). Quite a small portion and would\'ve preferred if there was a slightly crispier top instead of soft and almost soggy texture throughout. Think I prefer sprmrkt\'s! Vanilla ice cream was yummy but not worth the extra 3 bucks which made this abt $8+?!😱
Hummingbird cake (banana/pineapple/coconut) was so moist, dense and I probably can\'t finish it on my own. Strawberry tofu cheesecake was good as usual! Both cakes are $5.90 each.
Dessert before dinner.As the strawberry tofu cheesecake is sold out,we settled for the Victoria Sponge which is sponge cake,light cream &amp; strawberries
Top it off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream if you like. Head down to Cake Spade now to try this new item!
Just realized I haven\'t been back for almost 4 months.
$5.90 a slice. Absolutely heavenly and refreshing. Cheesecakes are usually pretty heavy but this was a nice light dessert. The ratio of peach agar to cheesecake was perfect and went well together. This is one cake that is really worth the hype!!
Smooth texture and buttery crust  but It could be more sour. Anyway I still love it.
Taken some time back 🍰 #repost
Really impressed with their cakes being not a cake lover. This is the best carrot cake I have tried. Love the very slight cinnamon tinge in the moist &amp; textured cake covered in a savoury cheese creme.
Strawberry tofu cheesecake. Their favourite choice, and it\'s really good.
Dark and moist chocolate cake layered with fresh banana slices on a bed of dark chocolate mousse
It\'s a light and amazingly delicious cheesecake with a strawberry jelly with cheese and then a digestive crust when put together is just heaven in your mouth.
Vouchers to be redeemed in store on Friday and Saturday 25-26 April 2014 while stocks last. Happy 1st to Cake Spade!
I absolutely love their red velvet cheesecake &amp; humming bird!! Cake is moist and not too sweet! 
Featuring Pyjamas Party Split, a GREASE themed cake in glass jar. Biscuit crumb base with layers of bananas, strawberries and mascarpone cream, and topped it off with a hearty red cherry. It is best eaten when it\'s chilled.
Love how the cakes are soft and not overly sweet. The cream cheese toppings went really well with both cakes. The only bane abt this shop is that it\'s always crowded with people. Pay off price for awesome cakes!
no strawberry? get the peach one instead! peach tofu cheesecake
Not worth the time travelling as I\'ve tasted way better red velvet cakes. It has a cream texture instead of cake! The Strawberry Tofu doesn\'t have a \"wow\" factor to it as well. Overrated.
Brownie Cheesecake from Cake Spade with an edible rose on Valentine Day!
Been wanting to try this for.... ever! Lol. Finally got to taste the legendary Tofu Cheesecake today! Light jello-like and not too sweet at all, very interesting.

Its pack at Cake Spade; naturally. \n<br />Tried her new Red Velvet Cheese Cake.\n<br />(Needs a little more cheese favouring)
Having sweet tooth and craving for the Red Velvet Cheesecake I had at Cake Spade yesterday. The Red Velvet Cake is very dramatic looking with its bright red color sharply contrasted by the white cream cheese frosting a top.
New cakes on the Cake Spade menu. Featuring the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Looking pretty festive looking in red and so-good, this cheesecake may possibly become a fixture on your Christmas dessert menu. ❤️
Love the red velvet cake!

Cake Spade finally has a new dessert item on the menu. Thou\' I\'m still loving their tofu cheesecake, I always excited to try new items! Love Victoria Strawberry Sponge? Then you will love this classic cake with strawberry and mascarpone cream. Cake Spade Owner-baker Zenn also told me that there\'s gonna be another new cake launch by end of this week, Double Chocolate Cheesecake if I did catch it correctly. Looking forward to her new creations!
This is really a very light cheesecake! Good for someone who is not a cheese person! 
First time trying tofu cheesecake and the texture is really interesting. The cake was lacking in cheese flavor though. But overall it\'s pretty good
Eyeball Trick-or-Treat! The hummingbird cake shouldn\'t be any stranger to you, for those who have tried this! 
Back at my favorite daily cake store for my dessert fix! So glad that Cake Spade open it\'s doors after a 3-day hiatus! Dark chocolate banana cake goes bloody with a vampire fang!

Me against the world kind of afternoon. Armed with work, wavering thoughts, a cup of coffee and a peach tofu cheesecake (no tofu, just the texture!)
Yepp to all the smart guessers! It is indeed from Cake Spade! The cheese tofu is really interesting and yummy! there are other delicious desserts too, you have to try them as well! #cafehoppingsg #cafehopping #cafe #cafesg
Back at my favorite dessert store, featuring the Carrot cupcake with green colored cream cheese frosting and tied with a white ribbon. #cute到
I can eat desserts everyday, 3 meals a day especially cakes. Re-featuring the Peach Tofu Cheesecake ($5.50/slice, $49/whole) and the Dark Chocolate Banana Cake ($6.20/slice, $55/whole). I can never get sick eating these succulent cakes again and again, even though I have tried all of the cakes at @cakespadesg
Because one is never enough, I have another. The popular hummingbird cake is no stranger to most of you, and it is also available in cupcake sizes.
Back at my favorite cake store for dessert fix before meeting! Don\'t know what to choose, since I have tried all the cakes, I decided to give the cupcakes a try. The last time, I had the Rocky Road cupcake, it was really Awesome. \n<br />Hence today, I\'m trying the Peanut Butter Chocolate cupcake (PBC). Loving the true flavour of peanut butter in the soft and moist cupcake with chocolate and peanut butter frosting swirl on top, and sticked with a chocolate \'kitkat\' biscuit.
Didn\'t want to spend a bomb on a birthday cake as it\'s for 3 person. Here\'s a good choice, 6\" lemon tart or salted caramel tart for $20. Choose the lemon tart, the texture is soft &amp; moist but slightly too sour for my liking. ☺️
Peach tofu cheesecake yum to the tums. Post lunch grub with my future work lunch/dinner khaki!
If you\'re an ultimate chocolate fan, you will love the ultimate \"Rocky road\" cupcake. This moist chocolate cupcake is loaded with chocolate buttercream, chocolate drizzle, marshmallow and almond flakes! I just gone into #cupcakecoma with this piece of heaven from Cake Spade.

Back at my Daily Cake Store again and finally had the Lemon Tart. Maybe I should get a loyalty card or something haha! 😋
Just realized that I didn\'t had any desserts the whole day, I was too busy at work. Getting my sweet-tooth fix at my favorite daily cake store and just on time for the Salted Caramel Tart, before the store closes for the day, which completes my day as well.
Getting my dessert fix for the decadent Molten Chocolate cake á la mode and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
Tofu Cheesecake at Cake Spade. Crazy consistency of  a beancurd whilst maintaining the cheesecake\'s richness and flavor overlaid with a delectable peach jelly. #lifechanged #cake #burpple
Whenever I stand in front of the counter I am always spoilt for choice, as every bakes here looks so tempting; I end up ordering at least 2 slices or more. Did I tell you that I actually tried all the cakes on the menu? And yes indeed, but still short of those lovely tarts that are always sold out when I come. Strawberry tofu cheesecake is still my number 1 choice (for cheesecake range). And so I put on the \"1\" candle!
Yummy! The cheesecake wasn\'t too sweet. Will be back to try the strawberry cheesecake. 
Opened by the gutsy Zenn Eng, Cake Spade brings something fresh to the cake scene. Her tofu cheesecakes are genius, light and creamy at the same time, appealing even to those who don\'t like cheese or tofu (well, they don\'t actually contain tofu, it refers to the texture). The Strawberry/Peach Tofu Cheesecakes ($5.60) are must-try treats, as well as the Brownie Base Cheesecake ($6.50), which combines the best of two amazing worlds. What Cake Spade has really achieved is great balance and irresistible variety. Check out this little space for yourself, and get a few (or many) slices to share.
Finally trying tofu cheesecake. It reminds me of jelly hearts and I have to say I pretty much enjoy this alot (; 
Soft and delicious like bean curd, yet rich like a cheesecake. Not \'gerlard\' at all! Highly recommended
Peach tofu cheesecake 
Red velvet cake, spice carrot cake and peach tofu cheesecake from Cake Spade! We love the name &amp; the cakes. Plus a moment of me acting cute lol #instavideo
Strawberry tofu cheesecake. I must must say I love the name of the shop... Cake Spade.
And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future~John F. Kennedy
Visited Cake Spade again. \n<br />Tried the Dark Chocolate Banana Cake.\n<br />Not bad and not too sweet too. \n<br />Good baking skill!
I\'m 2 weeks late, but glad to be back at Cake Spade for the luscious tropical Mango Tofu Cheesecake! If only the mango taste can be much stronger (a little bland), peach and strawberry tofu cheesecake still my top favorites! Will look forward for more delectable cakes and hopefully new flavours!
this is my favorite cake in Singapore! and my weekly obsession! 
AriZona Iced Tea is 100% natural, healthy, and refreshing drink. There\'s varieties of AriZona Iced Tea such as Black Tea, Green Tea and White Tea. I had my Blueberry White Tea at @cakespadesg yesterday! The bottle presentation is beautiful right! 💐🌺🍇
Brownie Bottom Cheesecake! The last cake on my cake spade list!
Friday dessert of the day! Strawberry Tofu Cheesecake! 🍓🍰
if u r sleepy in the afternoon.... wake yourself up with sugar treats... this is SUPER YUMMY!
The ultimate Spiced Carrot Cake!  So soft, moist and laden with sweet spice! One of the best sellers highly recommended by @zennoki
Chocolate Blackout cake!  A true American classic, so rich and chocolatey! 
Dark Chocolate Banana Cake is moist and flavorful with the sweetness of bananas and chocolate. 
Back at Cake Spade for Zenn\'s signature The Hummingbird cake! 
Peach Tofu Cheesecake, one of the signature at Cake Spade, strongly recommended by the owner Zenn!  For those who doesn\'t know this isn\'t real tofu, just that the texture is so smooth and silky it feels like tofu! I love how it was made using digestive biscuit for the crust base! Will try the strawberry tofu next round! 
Nutella Crumble with Ice Cream! My eyes were glued on the menu when I saw Nutella, and can\'t decide between Molten brownie or Nutella crumble. In the end, I have chosen Nutella! Doesn\'t taste much of Nutella, but the biscuit base was yummy with a chocolatey crunch! 
Red Velvet cake from Cake Spade! It was light and spongy with a strong buttermilk taste. However, frosting was a little too creamy! Overall was still pleasant! 
soft cheesecake which is mildly sweet. smooth like tofu and melts together with jelly layer. lucky ppl who works at tanjong pagar, remember to have one after lunch!
😂
May we all be blessed on this special day with our love ones and beyond.
The lychee cake is refreshingly good

the speculoos cheesecake was SO GOOD.

We had a Victoria sponge cake and the Hummingbird cake. The coconut flavour in the hummingbird cake came through like, \"hey girl hey\" 😄 Really well executed cake. Will certainly return for more. For now, \"Let them eat Cake!\" 🍰 #cakespade #burpple #girltime #brunch🍴 #rainydays☔️ #singaporelife
I mean Cake Spade\" This is my must go place whenever I\'m in the area for work. Aside from being very instagrammable, they serve up a good variety of cakes. You won\'t get revolutionary flavours here but simple flavours when done right, will almost never disappoint. Personal favourite: Tofu Cheesecakes - it makes you feel less guilty and since its lighter than the usual cheesecakes, go and have another piece, you deserve it 😜. For those who claim to have another stomach for desserts, go for the chocolate varieties, they\'re sinfully rich and sweet. Down them with a cup of hot tea ( I think the \"Pink Flamingo\" or something is quite good) ahhh... perfect for a lazy afternoon 😊. #sgfoodie #sgfood #fooddiary #sg #cakes #cake #sweet #dessert #desserts #burpple #foodreview #foodporn #instadaily #instafood #chocolate #cheesecake #tea #girls

A display of fruity tones, it is ethereally light and not overly sweet. So that you don\'t feel guilty eating one by yourself, or even eat one more.

These tasted so much healthier than the usual rich buttery no-bake ones I make. They\'re really light &amp; soft. Super jiggly wobbly too (check my insta stories lol) 😂 \n<br />Yet to satisfy my craving for a good matcha latte. Hopefully I\'ll be able to fix that on my next off day.

The tart was on a the sweeter side (given normal lemon meringue standards), but not complaining as I needed something sweet for a bad day 💪🏻

😊 This is one cheesecake that I really don\'t mind having a second helping as it is light, refreshing and not overly cheesy. (Date: 2 November 2016 Wednesday) #MsJaniceEats_Cakes
