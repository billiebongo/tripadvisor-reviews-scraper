Long awaited meal at Alter Ego. Love how they have both \'healthy\' and \'indulgence\' menu. We ordered the original salmon poke bowl, and sinfully, pizza fries, pulled pork and shortrib grilled cheese sandwich. While the gentleman praised the grilled cheese, the lady - me loves the poke bowl much more. Not just because it\'s healthy... different ingredients topping the bowl imparts different texture and taste. I didn\'t expect myself to say this, but i will be back!! For the POKE. $70 for 4 dishes.
Been wanting to try this eatery for the longest time ever since I saw pictures online and heard abt it because the food looked absolutely stunning. I ordered the original poke bowl filled with brown rice, shoyu salmon cubes, spiced cashews, pickled mushrooms, lime avocados and topped off with the usual poke bowl toppings. I have no words to describe the taste of this dish, it was just brimming with flavor and texture, basically an extremely well thought out and cohesive poke bowl ($17). I will definitely come back to order it again. It has lived up to my hype for sure 😛😛😛😛
I had pulled pork dip, shortrib grilled cheese (without the meat HAHA) [$13] and pizza fries [$14] at alter ego :) the pulled pork dip was very nice, with the pulled pork being v flavourful and cohesive with the savoury toasts at the side. The tenderness of the pork just mashed very well together with the crispness of the bread.
Every component worked really well together from the frozen vanilla bean parfait, homemade chocolate chip cookies to even the salted Milo sauce, every part well thought of to satisfy that cheat day sinful dessert cravings.
Cheese was gooey and not too salty! Fries was a tad bit little but super addictive. Worth a try for sure.
We had the Original Poke Shaker ($17) and Umami Omega ($17). Ever had the feeling of not wanted to finish your food so it can last a little longer? oh man :’) my fav part of the dish is basically the crispy kale chips with addictive lime avocado (i’m such a sucker or avocado 😭) AND THE SALMON ohhh god. It was our first time trying buffalo wings ($14) and we didn’t expect it to be THAT sour. Is it meant to be like that? oh man it was a cultural shock but overall experience was GREAT &amp; will definitely head back to try more stuff.
😋 A thick slab of deep fried spiced chicken thigh adorned with cheese sauce, sandwiched between buttery brioche buns smeared with creamy housemade ranch. Along with a side of tangy purple slaw and honey butter cornbread, the chicken patty had a crisp golden brown exterior with a tender, succulent interior of juicy chicken thigh meat. The nacho cheese added a smoky, cheesy flavour with a lingering peppery spiciness. The buttered brioche buns were soft, fluffy with a lingering buttery fragrance, further enchanted by the spread of tangy, creamy ranch. The purple slaw was crunchy and refreshing with a tangy, sour note- a refreshing relief to the other sinful elements. The honey butter cornbread was soft and fluffy with a texture resembling a pound cake. Luscious with a pleasant tinge of sweetness, it was a much better substitute to the typical fries IMO! Though it would have been better if the texture is less fragile and crumbly and perhaps more pillowy and compact... .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #smitteneats #smittenchoice
For just $15.90, you will get 1 main and 1 drink (choose either coffee or tea)! Choose from their \"Eat Clean\" Pokebowls or \"Indulge Dirty\" choice. My pick would definitely their hearty Seafood Gumbo that is really comforting, paired with their yummy bread.
The poke bowl that sounds the least exciting, got it because it said \'avocado poke\'. And it was great sooo much avocado and just loads of ingredients, which, while healthy, doesn\'t taste overly bland. Really really filling bowl as well
Being someone who absolutely lives for comfort food, I HAD to order the Grilled Cheese ($13); opted for the meatless version sans shortrib and it was still a good decision as I could focus on the ooey gooey melty goodness of gryuere and taleggio cheese in between golden, buttery artisanal white bread. The accompanying tomato soup was piquant, tangy and very much on the sour side (felt more like pasta sauce) but nicely balanced out the richness of the cheese!!
Tangy &amp; good (just like what the menu says) eat it with your hands~
DAMN DELICIOUS. Though soup was quite sour to my liking. Its okay, i has my cheese toast. You can taste the boneless ribs in everrry bite #veryyummy #pleasetryit
What you can find inside this poke bowl: \n<br />Salmon sashimi, rice, limed avocado, roasted cashews, pickled veggies, fish roes. The taste of this poke bowl is somewhat unique but acceptable. Good to share so you can try other dishes! Yiak yiak!
The dishes at our brunch today were akin to alter egos of each other. The Loaded Taters ($13), which we crunched on non-stop with the mini hash browns and maple-glazed #bacon doused in nacho cheese, sour cream, hot sauce proved wayyy addictive. Amazingly, we could really taste the maple in the glazed bacon. And then a masqueraded healthy spicy garlic salmon poke bowl.\n<br />💫\n<br />Just like 2 different personalities on the spectrum, but still getting along swimmingly.
Who doesn\'t like cheese !! Oozy cheese perfectly go well with the bread.
If the mesmerising layer of cheese doesn\'t blow you away, the bacon sauce will.
Honestly this dish was terribly overhyped. It did excite me in terms of presentation when it first arrive but the soggy fries left me disappointed. The pepperoni was great to have with the fries but it still couldn\'t save the fact that the fries felt like they were soaked in water before being served to us. Crispier fries would\'ve pushed this dish to be much better. 
Umami Omega (Pre-set Poké Bowl) @ Alter Ego🥗🥙🍣\n<br />• Spicy Garlic Sesame Salmon\n<br />• Sushi Rice\n<br />• Lime Avocado\n<br />• Crispy Salmon Skin\n<br />• Pickled Seasonal Veggies\n<br />• Ikura
Excellent execution behind the scenes resulting in an overall silky consistency thickened with roasted vegetables, served with a medley of shrimp, shredded chicken, Italian sausage, &amp; garlic paprika bread soldiers on the side. Have been yearning to return ever since I came here for a tasting some time back 🙌🏻
Gruyere and taleggio cheese with braised beef short rib sandwiched between artisanal white loaves
Joining in on the poke bowl craze - I love the idea of marinated salmon complemented with an assortment of sides atop a bowl of carbs (or lettuce for the healthier days). This place is about as good as it gets IMO. 
😂
$14. Drenched in 3-cheese sauce. Kids will love it.
Generous with some of their ingredients (e.g. the tobiko &amp; the satsifyingly thick salmon chunks) and not so much with the others (e.g. ikura &amp; pineapple). This felt like a fusion take on the chirashi-don, which didn\'t turn out bad at all! I loved that the lime avocado also helped to cut the richness of the dish. Still not jumping on the poké bowl bandwagon, but I have to admit this was a good bowl.
Decided to go for the Original Poké Shaker ($17) which featured the original shoyu salmon and a delightful balance of creamy lime avocado and crisp, spicy roasted cashews, both of which were add-ons I\'ve been wanting to try at their sister outlet @apoketheory. I\'ll be back for more soon! #burpple #xuannyeatsclean
Loved their toppings, but I wouldn\'t recommend the bowl with the kimchi, thought it didn\'t quite match..
Best food ever 🤤\n<br />Introduced @alteregosg to friends who asked me where to dine at and they came back to me telling me that they love it!\n<br />Do I need to say more? 😉
Frizza? Haha! Feed your sinful alteregos at @alteregosg! Got to make a trip back!
Alter Ego\'s Grilled cheese is sure to satisfy..\n<br />*\n<br />This was made to perfection- golden brown and crisp while remaining light &amp; fluffy and...and...with the oozy gruyere &amp; taleggio cheese in between. The braised short rib was also tender. Remember to dip them into the light tangy tomato soup too. Trust me, absolutely delectable. Your stomach will thank you😊😋\n<br />*\n<br />Some foods are worth visiting a thousand times. Don\'t you agree? 😊\n<br />*\n<br />*\n<br />#burpple
Slathered in rich three-cheese sauce and crowned with smoky pepperoni, this must order bar bite was a sure treat. Madly addictive and not to be ignored, the side of tangy house-made bacon ketchup definitely enhanced the whole experience (giving the savoury flavours a lift of sweetness). The warm, gooey cheese covered fries were also perfectly crisp! But do eat while it\'s hot (cause it gets jelat real fast) and note that some fries might be neglected from the cheese party uptop.
\'Dirty\' western mains are only available at dinner time. It\'s a pretty good rendition with cornbread. Wished it came with some fries though.
We order 4 different poke bowls, namely the original poke shaker, umami omega, the wildcard and dynamite kicking. We also had a grilled cheese sandwich and some pizza fries. 🍕🍟🍚\n<br />•\n<br />Since it was my first time trying a poke bowl, I would definitely say that it was something refreshing compared to normal Japanese food with all the different refreshing ingredients combined together. My fav among all bowls would be he dynamite kickin\' as recommended by @_jessssyyyy. Pizza fries tasted pretty normal I would say! 👌🏻\n<br />•\n<br />All in all, I would go back for the poke bowls again! Delicious! 😍\n<br />•\n<br />A bowl would cost you ($15-$16+) each. Located nearest to Esplanade mall. 👍🏻\n<br />•\n<br />Have a good Sunday everyone! Hashtag #thegrowingbelly to share your meals with us! We want to know what you will be eating this weekend! 😍\n<br />•\n<br />Thanks to @justinfoodprints for recommending the place and @_jessssyyyy for recommending the bowls and foods to us! 😄\n<br />•\n<br />#pokebowl #flatlay #foodstyling
The Poke Bowl wiped away all my guilt after my sinful indulgences of the other dishes. I particularly found the salmon fresh, and cashews highly addictive. Enjoyed the fact that the crowd on a weekday afternoon was light too!
Every bite was so addictive and at each spoonful it became more appealing. I ordered the Original Poke Shaker and sneaked a small taste of 2 other bowls realising that my friend\'s (dynamite kickin\') was the best of em all. Each bowl was a beautifully harmonised mixture of flavours and textures and a dainty portion which makes me wnna go back for more.
First sip tasted slightly weird but it gradually gets better.. Lovin the label design cause it looked so English😍
It\'s not as sinful as it says. Very light and not too spicy sauce. The bread is very warm and soft! Nice thing to share!
Sister cafe to A Poke Theory serves the same high quality salmon poke bowls. Love the light but sweet and nice sauce that they mixed inside. Very well balanced with seaweed and kale chips
Even with only four desserts on the menu, fret not - Alter Ego helps with your sweet cravings - be it the difficult decision of eating clean, or a sinful indulgence. 
Alter Ego will be revamping its menu soon and one of the new dishes is this Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich — two buttered brioche bun sandwiching an incredibly thick slab of tender fried chicken thigh drenched with cheese. I\'m sold!!! 🤤
Catch-up with my childhood friend.\n<br />•\n<br />My favourite go-to-place☺️\n<br />Umami Omega Poke bowl ($16) \n<br />Cause i cravin\' for their poke bowl. \n<br />#burpple
At the end of the day, what matters most is how it makes you feel inside. So diet what diet? 🤗\n<br />.\n<br />Tried this indulgent-tasting new dish from @alteregosg the other day. Essentially a succulent crispy fried southern spiced chicken thigh blanketed in cheese sauce, sandwiched between a buttery brioche bun smeared with housemade ranch, alongside inherent tomato &amp; lettuce.\n<br />Though we got ours served with fries instead, the original dish would be served with purple slaw (foresee a powerful marriage with the southern style chicken if this can be done right) &amp; honey butter cornbread.\n<br />This was taken from a tasting tour at Esplanade Annexe, &amp; genuinely listed as one of my top favourites from that day. Will hold high expectations the next time I visit again.
With so many positive reviews from the Burpple Tastemakers and community, I finally got a chance to try out the food here at Alter Ego. This Original Poke Shaker (S$16.00) is the trending Poke Bowl that contains fresh greens, avocado and spice roasted cashew nuts. With sushi rice lining the base and shredded seaweed placed on top of this dish, one may probably agree that it looks like a deconstructed Japanese Handroll.
Chicken skin spiced up and deep fried to make this an S$8.00 finger food to go with your after-work drinks. However, because of the amount of seasoning used, I feel that it is challenging to finish this if no beverage (read: beer) is ordered.
The timeless and classic marriage between golden crusty toasts and oozy melted cheese, Alter Ego’s Grilled Cheese ($11) was so darn good. A mix of gruyere and taleggio cheese, the savoury gooey combination was brought to the next level with the wafer-like exterior and fluffy softness of the loaves.
But one made for you by a friend takes some beating. The rendition at @alteregosg is more gingery, and very very refreshing. Also new review of them just up!
My friend and I went to Alter Ego (A Poke Theory\'s alternative branch) for the poke bowls because they were nearer to us, and I have to say that I preferred this to Aloha Poke by far. The fish was well seasoned and the ingredients balanced each other out nicely. The cherry on top was definitely the fried fish skin- it\'s really my weakness!
Loaded Taters
Fried Chicken Skin
Buffalo Wings
Dynamite Kickin\' ($15)
Grilled cheese sandwiches for EVERYONE - @alteregosg.
#sorrynotsorry\n<br />•\n<br />Anyhow, this is my go-to bowl whenever I\'m feeling the poke craving! 😁\n<br />•\n<br />In case you\'re wondering what ingredients comprise the bowl, I\'ve listed them below based on what I could identify. 😂\n<br />•\n<br />🍚: White rice, salmon sashimi (soaked in a spicy garlic sesame marinade), flying fish roe, salmon roe, kale chips, pineapples, sliced cherry tomatoes, lime-infused avocados, mushrooms, cucumbers, pickled seaweed and roasted seaweed\n<br />•\n<br />P.S.: Photobombed by a random leg 😪
Everything mix together taste kinda weird. The kale chips is coated with coconut oil, just cant describe how weird the whole mixture is. 👍 3/5\n<br />📍 Maybe going back to try other stuff\n<br />✖️ Not going to order Umami omega anymore
.\n<br />Cravings satisfied. Glad that my friend loved this bowl of goodness too! 💕 \n<br />#burpple
The Original Poke Shaker
Here\'s something where everything sings in harmony - the rich, piquant sauce, the snappy sausage, the pillow of a bun.
The first order of business this new year is to try to eat clean (try being the operative word here), so I got myself a poke bowl with well… pizza fries on the side.
On a less positive note, the salted egg yolk chicken wings (not shown) were quite possibly the worst I\'ve had. Soggy and lacking that salted egg yolk punch. @alteregosg this is one dish you should consider taking off the menu. Ok bye. #instafood #sgfood #hangryeats #burpple #feastmode
Never been a huge fan of mojitos till I tried the ones at Alter Ego. Packed to the brim with lime and crushed mint, it\'s a mega refreshing drink in the heat — especially with that extra little something. And having shaken a few myself, I assure you it is quite a naughty drink 😉 What I enjoy most is the earthiness that comes from using really dark brown sugar (it reads \"black sugar\" on the packet I kid you not), that adds a kind of depth to a typically really sweet cocktail.
Please eat the Pizza Fries and Grilled Cheese Sandwich. I even dream of them these days. Love everything about this place. Good food, vibe and prices.
4 munchies: Topped with smokey pepperoni and smothered generously with three types of cheese – gruyere, mozzarella and Parmesan, I liked how the fries were cut thick not only for a good bite, but also for getting more of the gooey cheese on them. The house-made bacon ketchup served at the side was absolutely smashing; it was sweet-savoury with hints of smokey bacon and caramelised onion flavours.
Opened by the same duo that owns A Poke Theory, Alter Ego’s grunge industrial vibe is a world apart from the clean space of its Telok Ayer counterpart.\n<br />:\n<br />The #BurppleTastemakers had a major tasting session few weeks back, and we experienced the day-to-night transition of dishes - we did eat for 3 hours long after all 😂 The caramelised ikan bilis with cashew nuts was my ultimate weakness. The puffy anchovies are generously dressed with a secret spice mix before being baked, creating the addictive candied gloss. Witnesses have spotted me sneaking my fingers into the bowl non-stop... I\'m a sucker for delicious sweet and savoury foods, and there was no way I could back off from the crispy snack. This, with a bottle of cider from their long list of beverages, will make your night out a well-celebrated one.\n<br />:\n<br />Thanks @Burpple for the invite, and @chocolatetbasil from @alteregosg for stuffing us silly! #Burpple
Thou this is only hashbrowns w bacon &amp; sour cream, it tasted surprisingly good! Overall the price are pretty affordable and portion was just nice (but might not be enough for guys). #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #throwback #alterego
I love how the way they present the pulled pork in a pan. The bread that comes along w it was really soft. 😋 Its good for sharing cos it might get abit jelak towards the end. #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #throwback #alterego
Their price is slightly more expensive for the portion. I\'m not an expert in Poke Bowl, so I thought taste was somewhat similar to other Poke bowls I\'ve tried. Anyhows, it\'s still nice luh! 😅 #burpple #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #throwback #pokebowl #alterego
Very brilliant creation! Chef approves! Let me tell you why I would love this more than raclette over fries! Firstly the choice of cheese is very wise, mozzarella. Mozzarella is a very very mild cheese which is good with oily fried stuff which you don\'t get sick of it after mouthful of it. We literally kept eating this non stop. They gave a side of tomato sauce to accompany this. A hint of sweetness and a hint of acidic of the tomato sauce works like magic for this. They are soooo generous with the cheese that the cheese is literally more than the fries. I can guarantee that you\'ll be so intrigued when you pull the fries out. The mozzarella is so stretchy!!!! Check out the video in the next post! Meanwhile you might wanna put this in your bucket list!
Tater tots with the perfect complements: sour cream, cheese sauce, bacon and a tinge of spiciness from the jalapeno sauce.
Blend of flavours, very healthy, very unique. I would recommend this if you are into trying different things
SO DELICIOUS! I thought that people mainly ordered this for the novelty but it actually tastes really good. Such a great guilty pleasure side dish, the cheese is all the way through the fries, not just on the surface, highly reccomended 👍🏼
This dish is very common among \'bar bites\' menus all around. Alter Ego\'s take on it is sublime with a killer marinade that is made even more decadent with a side dip of the ranch sauce. It\'s finger licking good! 🍴\n<br />This was a hosted meal courtesy of @alteregosg with fellow #burppletastemaker @chocolatetbasil as our lovely host. Thanks @burpple for the invite!
daaaaaamn the tater tots are so good i would have them a billion times more!!!!! i like how the menu has all sorts of greasy guilty pleasures and would make a great place for a night out w pals! the flavors are amazing and makes all the guilt that comes after worth it woohoo
I love kimchi and I love spicy tuna, but a bit too much of kimchi and the balance is lost -- my friends and I struggled to appreciate our Tuna. Please, LESS KIMCHI! Much preferred the Umami Salmon one for more balance in the taste buds, but this was still nonetheless enjoyable for all of us.
There is this Umami Omega ($16) – a Spicy Garlic Sesame Salmon bowl, and Dynamite Kickin’ ($15) – a Spicy Mayo Tuna bowl.
An healthy alternative on the menu. \n<br />The huge chunks of Salmon were well seasoned with explosion of various sensations in the mouth - crunch from the roasted cashews, bursting ikura &amp; pure bliss from the fatty avocado. It would have been heaps more awesome if the portion of ikura was bigger 👀
Throwback to our Monthsary at Alter Ego\n<br />The night began with a refreshing drink and tortilla chips with the french onion dip.
Then you need to check this out! 😋\n<br />.\n<br />Pizza fries ($14)\n<br />Fries generously smothered with 3-cheese sauce, topped with sliced smoky pepperoni &amp; served with a side of savoury house-made bacon ketchup. \n<br />My friend thought this could be quite sinful. \n<br />I had them all to myself. These fries were madly addictive👅\n<br />#burpple
Dynamite kickin\' ($15) \n<br />Spicy mayo tuna on sushi rice, served with premiums kimchi &amp; crispy salmon skin, topped with ikura &amp; pickled veg. The combination of the ingredients were close to perfect, which made every mouthful very enjoyable. \n<br />#burpple
Weekend = Indulgence. Craving for some legit Grilled Cheese Sandwich after workshop. A wonderful combination of gruyere and taleggio cheese sandwich between perfectly toasted bread, see that gooey cheese as you break them apart! Or add $3 for some tender braised beef short rib filling.
Highly recommend the Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Loaded Taters, Pizza Fries and of course their Poke Bowls! Try the Wildcard which has Avocado Miso Tuna on Sushi Rice and topped with guacamole, kimchi, slow cooked pork and nori strips. Really Shiok!
One bite into this and any thoughts of diet would\'ve gone out the window. Loved everything about this - the southern spice mix, delightfully light and crisp skin without all that greasiness. This is definitely the perfect bar food with your booze (but no, not a sharing dish because sinful as it is, you\'d probably want to finish it by yourself. I would. 😛)
At @alteregosg you have the choice to indulge healthily or sinfully.\n<br />🍴\n<br />Out of the Cacaoholic smoothie bowl, Lemon icebox pie , Black berry binge smoothie bowl, Berries &amp; Cream , I like Lemon Icebox Pie the most! 🍴\n<br />Graham crust w a tangy lemon no bake cheese filling topped with chantilly cream and berry reduction. 🤗🤗 I don\'t mind sacrificing calories for it! 🍴\n<br />#burpple #dessert #sinfuldessert #healthydessert #alterego
Crispy fries generously smothered with a triple cheese combi (parmesan, mozzarella, gruyere), topped with pepperoni slices and served with a side of house-made bacon ketchup for dips. Please just throw all those diet plans out of the window, for these madly addictive genius bites are sure to spoil you so bad, you won\'t settle for anymore cheese fries with too little cheese (those should be made illegal) 👅💦
Tossed in a spice blend Served in brown wax paper (like hawker centers), crisp fries are tossed in a spice blend, then smothered with a gooey 3-cheese sauce (mozzarella, gruyere and parmesan), and topped with sliced pepperoni. If that\'s not enough, it\'s also served with a house-made bacon ketchup. #MediaInvite
First try and im quite impressed with the food !!😍 The quality and quantity would definitely be an 8.5/10!! Tried pulled pork in the pic ( $11 ) , grilled cheese sandwich ( $11 ) and pizza fries ( $14 ). The pizza fries were amazing and all 3 dishes were very filling for 2-3 pax already☺️ Ambience was great too as it was just infront of Singapore River. Overall great experience for unique food with good pricing👍🏻👍🏻
No platitudes about Monday, just a sour cream capped mountain of crunchy outside, plush inside tater tots drenched in tangy jalapeno nacho cheese sauce and bak kwa-esque maple-glazed bacon, then blasted with hot sauce for that all important hit of heat. Righteous.
It is irrefutable scientific fact that #cheesepull triggers the firing of dopamine neurons as much so as cocaine in a crack fiend, so you really can\'t blame us for being addicted to this oozy three cheese sauce and smoky pepperoni smothered basket of fries. Oh and that house-made bacon ketchup.
Not your typical pulled pork - this kalua pork, slow-roasted till perfection with just the right bite/ tenderness and mixed with cabbage, has an Asian influence from the savoury spicy-sweet gochujang sauce. But what really stole the show for me was the toasted pita bread which was buttery, light and fluffy. Dip it into the generously saucy, tender pulled pork and this is certainly one beautiful marriage of ingredients - wouldn\'t hesitate to order this again the next time I\'m there! -\n<br />Thank you @chocolatetbasil &amp; @alteregosg  for hosting us and #burpple for the invite!
Look at THAT SICK CHEESE PULL.
Another dish that had us stretching into the bowl for more! Rubbed evenly with southern spice mix then deep fried, it sounds greasy but was not at all! Surprisingly light, super crunchy and clearly very addictive.
the quintessential sour and spicy of good buffalo wings totally on point here. tamed peppery spiciness here so nobody burns their tongues. but if (really) need be, just dunk into their in-house made ranch dressing to cool the heat. been awhile since i enjoyed such awesome buffalo wings.
Often, it\'s the simplest food that are difficult to impress but here\'s a Grilled Cheese ($11) done right. Order this for that instagram-worthy cheese pull. I\'m probably overusing the term comfort food here at Alter Ego but I have a weak spot for all things cheese and this was made to perfection - golden brown and crisp while remaining light and fluffy. Pull apart that toasted perfection and there there, the glorious oozy gruyere and taleggio cheese! But that\'s not all - add the tender, braised short ribs (+$3). And dip them into the light tangy tomato soup/dip. Your tummy will thank you. 
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Strrrrrretch that cheeeezzze to share and share alike! The \"Pizza Fries\" has slices of pepperoni and an oozily-melting combo of three cheeses blanketing a heap of large crispy fries. Before popping the fries in your mouth, make sure to swish them in the bacon jam for extra yumminess.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />This is a very well put-together Chilli Cheese Dog because every part that makes up its whole is spot-on.\n<br />It starts with a soft, fluffy bun that\'s griddled and buttered. Then in there snuggles a plump sausage - they use the crunchy, spicy sort that I gravitate towards under any circumstance, so yup, I love it already 😁 Not that you can see much of it in my pic since it\'s buried under an awesome housemade chilli that\'s all beef and zero beans (yay!!). To make sure this hotdog blasts right off the scale of sinfulness, it\'s finished with puh-lenty of melted cheddar cheese and sour cream. \n<br />Do note Alter Ego will be upgrading their Chilli Cheese Dog to a main course item (with a side of fries) soon, so the price might change.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Everyone I know has been raving about the Fried Chicken Skin at Alter Ego. Let me assure you this isn\'t empty hype but genuine honest-to-goodness bar food that\'s totally deserving of the high number of social media posts it\'s garnered. \n<br />The serving is very generous and every piece of the chicken skin is large, puffily crunchy and seasoned with an addictive blend of spices.\n<br />I foresee this to be one of the bestsellers here if it isn\'t already.
I N V I T E D  T A S T I N G\n<br />Tried both the \"Umami Omega\" and \"Green Goddess\" (background and foreground, $16++ and $13++ respectively) and found the latter to be my preferred choice. This came as a surprise to myself because I am a meat-lover and that\'s the vegan bowl! \n<br />I think it has a lot to do with avocado being the replacement for the usual tuna \"poke\" (I am a sucker for anything with avocado!). Also, there was a good mix of toppings that included Peruvian pomegranate, Japanese cucumber, pineapple, tomatoes, shimeiji mushrooms to create a flavourful experience. The carb, a medium-length grain rice, was something I enjoyed as well for its slightly chewy texture. I can\'t put a finger on the dressing but it brought everything together really well.
The birth of the ultimate most comfort food, the Pizza Fries ($14) from @alteregosg!! Essentially a pizza with fries base, instead of a dough crust, and paired perfectly with that BACON ketchup! (We seriously couldn\'t get enough of that sauce, and asked for extras 🙈).
For the healthy nuggets, there\'s Blackberry Binge Smoothie Bowl ($6), mixture of antioxidant berries and bananas or Cacaoholic Smoothie Bowl ($6), a blend of bananas and raw cacao.
Then you should check out @alteregosg where you can expect items like their healthy poke and smoothie bowls. \n<br />At their alter ego, there are 5 specially curated poke bowls to choose from. My picks will definitely be the Dynamite Kickin\' ($15) - spicy mayo tuna with side ingredients like kimchi, crispy salmon skin and ikura toss together and laid on their signature sushi rice. \n<br />Though unexpectedly good would be their vegan Green Goddess ($13) which switched your usual marinated fishes with poke avocado!! Thanks @alteregosg for feeding us and a job well done from @chocolatetbasil 🙆🏻🙆🏻🙆🏻
Anything cheese steals my attention right away and if you\'re a sucker for it too, Alter Ego\'s Grilled Cheese sandwich is sure to satisfy. Ohhhhh mah gawd that stretchy, gooey, oozing cheese between perfectly crisped fluffy golden toasts. This is simplicity at its best, maximum comfort guaranteed. 😭👌🏻 Top up $3 for braised beef short rib filling. 
This new spot in Esplanade Mall serves both healthy eats and sinful bar bites all day — two extremes we certainly welcome. Sister concept to A Poke Theory on Boon Tat St, expect four types of Hawaiian poké (pronounced ‘poh-kay’, marinated sashimi cubes served on grains or greens) bowls. This makes it a healthy and convenient option for office workers nearby. Alternatively, if you\'re feeling indulgent, swing by for their delicious bar bites like tater tots and grilled cheese sandwiches. After work, relax with a few bottles of craft beers and ciders while sharing the lusciously rich Pizza Fries ($14). It is blanketed generously with three types of cheese — gruyere, mozzarella and Parmesan, topped with smokey pepperoni and is Burpple Tastemaker Zhihui Lim’s “idea of the ultimate comfort food”!\n<br />Avg Price: $20 per person\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Zhihui Lim
so. good!! had the healthy bowl (which i heard is by the same people behind a poke theory) + tatter tots + pull pork with bread, favourites being the harsh brown &amp; the bowls (i wanna try the others!) will definitely be back
4 munchies: Spicy mayo tuna on sushi rice; topped with ikura and alfafa sprouts – the Dynamite Kickin\' was my favourite poké bowl out of the four that we tried. The creaminess and spiciness of the well-marinated tuna chunks balanced the crunchy greens nicely without being too heavy. For $15 a bowl, it also comes with premiums of kimchi and the super addictive crispy salmon skin!
🍴\n<br />Pumping pomegranate. Apple,rosehip,pomegranate tea with lemon slices and mint. I love how it is only slightly sweetened, allowing me to taste the fragrance of the tea. 😋 Drink clean. You don\'t need all the added calories from the sugar. 🍴\n<br />Thank you @burpple for the invite and @alteregosg &amp; @chocolatetbasil for hosting! 🍴\n<br />#burpple #icedtea #drinkclean #eatclean
Brined beforehand to lock in moisture, the drumettes and wingettes are twice-baked, then tossed in a delightfully spicy &amp; tangy buffalo sauce. The result? Juicy meat packed with flavour and not a little heat. Quench some of that fire in their cool and creamy house-made ranch dressing. I haven\'t had a more authentic and delicious buffalo wing since Handlebar moved out of Gillman Barracks.
My de rigeur side dish order for Nasi Lemak is elevated here with the use of cashews instead of peanuts. The whole lot is tossed in an addictive sweet and spicy mix then baked till caramelized, making it very hard to stop popping dem nutz. I foresee myself spending a considerable amount of time(and money) drinking here.
Dragging your fork through the sultry sauce made of spicy jalapeño cheese sauce, maple-glazed bacon &amp; sour cream, you\'ll find crispy tater tots downing in them. Or splash some hot sauce on top for the extra kick. Deceptively simple but so addictive, there goes my diet plan.
Taters drenched in jalepeno cheese sauce, topped w maple glaze bacon and sour cream. What I need now on this bad Monday. 🍴\n<br />This was one of my favourite, the taters with their crisp exterior and uhmazingly tasty sauce. Don\'t even bring up my nutritionist past. 😆 Eat this on cheat days or simply when you need a delicious bar bite! 🍴\n<br />Thank you @burpple for the invitation and @chocolatetbasil &amp; @alteregosg for hosting!\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #cheatmeals #alteregosg #taters
Blanketed generously with three types of cheese - gruyere, mozzarella and Parmesan, topped with smokey pepperoni, this is my idea of the ultimate comfort food. My heart skipped a beat when I dipped the fries with all that melty gooey cheesus into the savoury house-made bacon ketchup - can I have a day of snuggling with this, a good movie in bed (gon\' be messy but a girl can dream and the Monday blues is real)? This may not be what your body needs but here at @alteregosg they know what your heart wants. Yes, PIZZA FRIES, you\'ve got a pizza my heart ♥️\n<br />-\n<br />Thank you @chocolatetbasil &amp; @alteregosg for hosting us and #burpple for the invite!

Not forgetting the additional house made bacon, ketchup dip, which triggered my savory taste buds as it enters my mouth. But beware! Share this with your friends as it may get a bit gerlat after a few mouthful of it\n<br />•\n<br />Following the success of a poke theory a healthy eating Poke bowl. Alter ego presents itself as much more fun and sinful side, but still retaining its sister\'s concept of healthy eating. I would definitely say it would make a good hang out place for friends gathering.
Eat Clean or Indulge Dirty. Those working in CBD might feel a sense of déjà vu when seeing these bowls and it\'s not strange, after all they are run by the same team from A Poke Theory. During daytime, you\'ll still get your healthy poke and smoothie bowls but when sun sets the \"evil self\" come out to play as we indulge in cheesy grubs and selections of craft beers.
you know what ought to be breakfast everyday? this! the kalua pulled pork and cabbage stew was so slowly roasted i think they were one stop before disintegration. a symbiotic umami fusion must had happened then, bonded by the gochuchang sauce and formed an alter ego that was bewitching and addictive. you then want to handle this wet sultry entity with the fluffiest turkish pita bread specially toasted crisped to vessel it before partaking. only to realise this was going to be the next best sinful thing to happen in your life. @alteregosg, you had me to indulge dirty. i embraced my dark side now, thank you.
At @alteregosg , they give you the option to be full out healthy or slightly sinful with their deliciously sinful side dishes/ bar bites! 🍴\n<br />My favourite of the poke bowls got to be the original poke shaker with its original shout salmon topped with lime avocado and spices roasted cashews! They add a bit of pineapples to keep the rice bowl refreshing as too much raw fish can make it quite gelat. 🍴\n<br />Thanks @burpple for the invite and @chocolatetbasil &amp; @alteregosg for hosting!! 🍴\n<br />#burpple #pokebowl #alterego #eatclean
While the latter makes #eatingclean cool, its alter ego is all about striking a balance by offering both \"Eat Clean\" and \"Indulge Dirty\" menus.  What a genius way to satisfy everyone at the table.\n<br />〰\n<br />Here\'s the ultimate dirty dish, Fried Chicken Skin ($8), which, hands down, was my favourite of the 12 dishes we had. Rubbed and fried with a southern spice mix, the crisp chicken skin was light and crazily addictive, perfect with beer (do check out the interesting selection of craft beers &amp; ciders here). Highly recommended.\n<br />〰\n<br />Thank you @alteregosg for the warm hospitality, @chocolatetbasil for inviting &amp; hosting us, @burpple for organising this eatup, and @cassakating for being our hand model! 🙆
A grilled cheese sandwich is so simple but done superbly here at Alter Ego. Gruyere and taleggio cheese with braised beef short rib sandwiched between two slices of bread. The magic lies with that buttery toasted bread — so lightly crisp that it disintegrates almost instantly as I bit into it. The braised short rib was also wonderfully juicy and tender, especially lovely with the creamy cheese. A tomato soup is also served on the side which you can drink it, or as what we Singaporeans like to do, dip the bread into it!
A classic American dish is the buffalo wings that are twice-baked, then tossed in spicy and tangy buffalo sauce and served with house-made ranch. It was well coated with the tangy sauce and would definitely go well if you’re looking for some wings to do with your drinks.
This place gives you the option to eat clean with the Blackberry Binge Smoothie ($6) and Cacaoholic Smoothie Bow ($6), or indulge dirty with Berries and Cream ($11) and Lemon Icebox Pie ($11).\n<br />🔸\n<br />I’m more of a dirty person :p, so my favourite is the berries and cream which are macerated fresh strawberries with Chantilly cream and sugar glass. It actually aren’t that sinful, while the smoothies are also really light, so these are good options for a guilt-free sweet ending.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
It really is a genius idea to marry both pizza and fries together. The fries are drenched generously with a 3-cheese sauce made of gruyere, parmesan, mozzarella. The cheese is not just on the surface, but also in between the layers to ensure that you have more than enough cheese for every single fries! A savoury house-made bacon ketchup is served on the side for you to dip the cheesy fries in for the ultimate pizza fries experience.
For dessert — macerated berries served with cream and sugar glass. The macerated berries were tart yet sweet while the cream helped to neutralise the flavours overall. Break the sugar glass to add a little sweetness to the dessert overall.
[Newly Opened] Highly recommended! Three types of cheese are used here - gruyere, cheddar and parmesan.\n<br />🔸\n<br />What made me like this so much is also the white bread which is soft inside and crispy outside, so it has a very endearing smoky crisp and fluffiness to it. Eat this with the warm cheese, absolutely delectable.\n<br />🔸\n<br />But note that this dish is time sensitive, so to preserve this cheese-porny-texture you should eat it as soon as it is served, and not spend too much time taking photos or being polite to wait for a friend to start 😂\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
There are places that dish up comfort food, and then there are those that do it well. After Ego\'s rendition was set up for success right from the get-go—the aromatic white bread was specially sourced, then toasted to a crisp golden brown with a soft center, from which a luscious pool of cheese (your choice of Gruyere or Taleggio) oozes languidly.
Grilled Cheese Sandwich that\'s all oozy, stretchy and gooey in between crisp toast. Very comforting especially when dipped into the warm bowl of tomato soup on the side that gives it a tangy flavour. Top-up $3 to add braised beef short ribs in between the sandwich for a little meatiness to the stretchy cheese.
Brined, twice-baked and tossed in spicy &amp; tangy buffalo marinade. The wings were really not that spicy, which was good for me because I weep at the slightest bit of spice. I enjoyed dunking them into the creamy homemade ranch sauce 👌
Some saucey wings here that are brined, twice-baked and tossed in buffalo sauce served with a ranch dip on the side. The wings are juicy and tender, while the buffalo wings here are still pretty manageable overall — could definitely handle the spiciness here that wasn\'t numbing as one could definitely taste the tangy notes in the sauce.
Brined wings are twice-baked then tossed in buffalo sauce and served with house-made ranch. I like that tanginess of the buffalo sauce, but if only if it’s more spicy! Or perhaps an option to choose spice level? 😋\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
A slow roasted Kalua pork that is marinated with spicy gochujang sauce, it introduces an Asian twist to the usual barbecue sauce used. I love Korean food so I loved this pairing! Mixed with shredded cabbage, the soft tender meat releases its sweetness while you bite into the crunchy vegetables. I did not pay attention to the pita bread at first and only saw it as a means to eat the pulled pork. I placed some of the pulled pork onto the pita bread and sent it into my mouth. To my surprise, the toasted pita bread was so light and fluffy! With such a meaty dip, the light and fragrant bread was truly much needed.
The name Pizza Fries ($14) got us all excited when we heard that it was coming our way. And my oh my, was it a sight to behold when it arrived at the table.
The caramelized ikan bilis reminded me of those we have with nasi lemak, but now you can have it on its own at a cafe! Ikan bilis and cashew nuts tossed in their own secret spice mix and baked till caramelised, I wished that it is more spicy than sweet but that might suit those who can’t take spice well!
The fried chicken skin is rubbed with a southern spice mix then deep fried till golden and crispy. You just can’t stop popping them into your mouth! It’s great that it did not taste greasy at all
Nothing says sin quite like a huge bowl full of fried tater tots. And nothing says utter hedonism quite like said tater tots that have been mercilessly drowned in jalapeño cheese sauce, speckled with maple glazed bacon, and capped in the head with a wallop of a dollop of sour cream.
My favourite item under the “Indulge Dirty” menu. Tater tots, which are like mini hashbrowns, are doused heavily in jalepeno cheese sauce and mixed with maple-glazed bacon. I like that it’s fried till crispy, and how well the spicy cheese goes with sour cream. It’s really addictive.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is an invited tasting.
Irresistible bar bites at Alter Ego.
Tater tots are essentially fried potatoes, and who can say \'no\' to these? Especially when they sound like cute potato babies gone rogue. 
Well there isn\'t actually any potato in Alter Ego\'s pulled pork dip, but it didn\'t really need any taters. Alter Ego is A Poke Theory\'s newest venture, with the concept of \'Dr Jekyll &amp; Mr Hyde\' driving the establishment. During the daytime, the menu is full of innocent, healthy options such as poke bowls and colorful, Instagram-ready tea coolers, but at night, everything gets super naughty with craft beers  and downright depraved dishes such as these hijacking the menu.
A mind blowingly good melange of slow-roasted Kalua pork and shredded cabbage brought together by spicy gochujang sauce that\'s literally dripping with flavour. Scoop up the hot mess with toasty, fluffy pita which almost threatens to steal the spotlight from the star of the show. I\'m totally digging the dark side of Alter Ego.
Slow-roasted Kalua Pork that\'s all just moist enough without being too wet in spicy Gochujang sauce — its flavour pretty balanced as compared to the usual BBQ sauce; a tinge of spiciness, a little sweet and goes well with the savoury meat. What\'s better is the Turkish Bread served at the side — its similar to a good, toasted English Muffin with its crispness but less than dense texture; this was pretty light within. The bread\'s so good I reckon I would have it with just butter and sugar every day!
With spicy mayo tuna on sushi rice, served with cherry tomatoes, pineapples, cucumbers and premiums of kimchi &amp; crispy salmon skin, topped with ikura and alfafa sprouts. The combination of the kimchi with salmon skin was close to perfect, complemented with chunky well marinated tuna. I enjoyed the poke bowls as there was a generous amount and variety of ingredients, which made every mouthful very enjoyable. Even though I like to have meat in my meals, I thought the Green Goddess ($13, vegetarian) was pretty good too with the crunchy pomegranate, kimchi and lots of avocado!
If it ain\'t broke, why fix it? Original shoyu salmon with spiced roasted cashews, lime avocado, alfalfa sprouts and ikura, amongst other toppings. Loads of umami, texture, and all the flavour without any of the guilt.
[Newly Opened] The Poké Masters from Poke Theory now brings us a new concept, Alter Ego, which promises more sinful offerings besides these clean and healthy poke bowls.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I\'ll be publishing more reviews of the offerings at this sexy new hangout, which includes spicy cheese on taters, guilt-inducing fried chicken skin, cheese with short ribs in toasts, fresh strawberries with cream and sugar glass, and of course their clean but delectable Poké Bowls. The food is good and I would love to share more with you in subsequent reviews soon.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
For the health conscious who like a healthy bit of heat in their poke bowls, you\'ll definitely be pleased with the spicy mayo tuna and kimchi\'s simmering contrast to the cool, crunchy greens. This pre-set bowl also comes topped with crispy salmon skin and ikura for that extra bit of pop and crackle. Or choose to customise your own bowl with premium toppings such as Teriyaki Edamame and Kalua Pork from $1 to $2 per ingredient.
Got \'em during the tasting at Alter Ego, which is definitely one of the most memorable tastings of this year. If you\'re going \"wait a minute, isn\'t that just the nuts and ikan bilis that\'s served with nasi lemak..?\", you\'re absolutely right.
This is a tasty snack that wasn’t too heavy. Ikan bilis and cashews are mixed and baked till caramelized. I like that the crispiness of the ikan bilis and that sugar coating, and that mild spice in the caramel coating being a spice lover myself 😋
There is visceral satisfaction to be had in how crunchy and light these deep fried skins rubbed with southern spice mix are. Wash it down with Kona\'s grapefruitty Castaway IPA and you\'ve got the perfect bar snack and beer pairing.
Things that works great with some drinks at hand. Crisp, fried chicken skin that is seasoned with southern spice mix — a little salted, a little spicy; pretty addictive overall.
Spent a good part of the afternoon with the #BurppleTastemakers, checking out this hot new foodie joint at Esplanade Mall, aptly named \'Alter Ego\'—the second outfit from the folks behind \'A Poke Theory\'. While the latter makes #eatingclean cool, its alter ego is all about striking a balance by offering both \"Eat Clean\" and \"Indulge Dirty\" menus.  What a genius way to satisfy everyone at the table.
My favourite pokebowl of the afternoon. It’s mainly spicy mayo tuna on sushi rice, served with kimchi and salmon skin, then topped with ikura and alfafa sprouts.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I like how well-balanced all the ingredients are, you get a bit of creaminess, spice, tuna sweetness, and in terms of texture of plump fluffy rice with crispiness from the salmon. And it had a good ratio of toppings to rice, so it wasn’t too plain nor too gelat. Pokebowls may be my second favourite thing (hawker food still my favourite!) to have during lunch.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
Eat clean so you can sin later. That\'s definitely the concept at @alteregosg, which serves up virginal, innocent poke bowls by day such as the Green Goddess ($13, rear), which is vegan and is loaded with creamy cubes of avocado (does it qualify as a guac bowl?), nutty brown rice and pomegranate along with the usual trimmings of a standard poke bowl.
I’ve a new found love for kale, hence I like that this came with crispy kale chips on top of spicy garlic sesame salmon.\n<br />🔸\n<br />The sushi rice was moist and plump while the avocado has a refreshing lime zest to it. Alternatively, customise your own bowl just like how you would do it at Poke Theory and add all the things that you like.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
You really can have the best of both worlds. Combining three different cheeses for that oozy melty texture, Alter Ego\'s newest creation is to die for - Pizza Fries. I could not stop reaching out for it. The cheese is creamy, stretchy and super addictive and the fries are crisp at the edges and soft in the centre just the way I like it. Alter ego might be one of my new favourite places, with its chill vibes and delicious food.

Alter Ego\'s pizza fries are amazing. It\'s so good that I wish to finish it on my own. Definitely a must try during your first visit! If you want to skip the pizza fries, the loaded taters are a good alternative.
The poke bowls ranged between $16-$17 and had so much fresh salmon overflowing. None of us could finish the poke bowl 🙊😂

Sweet . Very sweet.
Loving everything in it.
Today is an exception. A very psychedelic poke bowl... healthy and detoxifying. No doubt it is full of goodness but halfway through \"poking\", the taste kinda got a little monotonous. Even the kale was sweet. Prolly due to the sesame dressing, the umaminess and the chunkyness of the salmon. Wont be \"poking\" for awhile or till the mood calls for it.
Pricey at $17 a bowl but the portion of salmon was very generous and filling. The avo and cashews were 😍❤
What a full bowl of fresh ingredients and flavours. Slightly on the pricier side of poke bowls, but the ingredients made up for it.
Look at those cheese, the crispy bacon bits with potatoes are dangerously addictive!\n<br />#esplanade #esplanadeannexe #artsXlife\n<br />#yummy #love #fatdieme #onmytable #topcitybites #exploresingapore #beautifulcuisines #stfoodtrending #sharefood #burpple #alteregosg #whati8today

The pulled pork has cabbage and sauce which gives it an Asian twist. The lightly toasted Turkish bread stole the show though; crispy, fluffy yet flaky, it matched perfectly with a spoonful of pulled pork. 🍴\n<br />This was a hosted meal courtesy of @alteregosg with fellow #burppletastemaker as our lovely host.

Loaded Taters ($13), what exactly is it? The crispy tater tots turned out to be mini hash brown doused mercilessly in a spicy jalapeno cheese sauce, maple-glazed bacon and sour cream. If you are up for challenge, you can splash some hot sauce to give it a fiery kick.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #cafesg #cafehoppingsg #hashbrown

You get to find the Eat Clean Pre-set Poke Bowl like The Original Poke Shaker, Umami Omega and The Wildcard or go for Fried Chicken Skin and Pulled Pork Dip to pair with some of their Craft Beers and unique Ciders like Pineapple Hard Ciders and Apple Crumble Ciders!\n<br />.\n<br />Location: 8 Raffles Avenue, Esplanade Mall, #01-13D, Singapore\n<br />.\n<br />#alteregosg #alterego #umamiomega #pokebowl #burpple #burpplesg
Well @alteregosg has it all. Starting with their deep fried crispy chicken skin which was sinfully delicious with their southern spice mix, then continuing to their loaded taters which was seriously loaded with 🌶 jalapeño cheese sauce and crispy bacon. Yummmmm. Finally their famous Pizza Fries which I have to say is not for the faint hearted. Fries with smoky pepperoni covered with their home made three cheese sauce and bacon ketchup. 🧀 🧀 . We took all that down with a bottle of The Hills Pear &amp; Zeffer Apple Crumble ciders. #burpple #burpplesg #alterego #loadedtaters #pizzafries #amazinggf #singaporelife #lifeisbeautiful #bestfoodever #cheese #friedchickenskin #saturdaynight #crazyweekends
The Original Poke Shaker S$16 filled with generous shoyu salmon, creamy lime avocado (SUPER ADDICTIVE), popping ikura, roasted cashews and sprouts! All the goodness in 1 bowl...i... i cannot!! Can you please make it less spicy @alteregosg for the lousy-no-chili-me? I promise to return for more. .\n<br />#singaporeinsiders #exploringsingaporeeats #whati8today #love #yummy #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #onmytable #beautifulcuisines #burpple #alteregosg #pokebowl #bokehlicious #nikonsg #nikon5500

.\n<br />Must try Umami Omega Poke Bowl! Spicy Garlic Sesame Salmon with Alter Ego\'s signature Sushi Rice served with Avocado, Kala Chips with Ikura, Alfafa Sprouts!

They are widely recognized by their crispness and cylindrical shape. \n<br />Doused mercilessly in spicy jalapeno cheese sauce, maple-glazed bacon &amp; sour cream, these bite size snacks are both dainty and incredibly addictive
Imagine having healthy poke bowls while dipping your sinful fries soaked in cheese! \n<br />Among my favourites, may I introduce you these amazing Pizza Fries S$14; fries soaked in 3 different melted cheese sauce, pepperoni and that super addictive bacon ketchup! #fatdiedontcare\n<br />.\n<br />#alteregosg #singaporeinsiders #exploringsingaporeeats #whati8today #love #yummy #stfoodtrending #tslmakan #onmytable #beautifulcuisines #burpple #cheese #cheesefries
The moment you dunk these bad boys into the tomato soup and deliver them into your mouth, it would almost instantly cause euphoria. With an option to choose between gruyere or taleggio, the cheese is sandwiched between artisanal white loaves and to up the ante further, why not add braised beef short rib filling for an additional $3?\n<br />•\n<br />This was a tasting hosted by @alteregosg.\n<br />•\n<br />Alter Ego\n<br />Address: 8, Raffles Avenue, Esplanade Mall, Unit 01-13D, Singapore 039802 #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #sedapteam #cafehopping #cafesg #sgcafes #esplanade #alteregosg
On the other hand, do pair it with the slow roasted Kulua pork which was really tasty with a slightly Korean twist with added spicy gochujang sauce and shredded cabbage.

Consisting a mixture of marinated salmon/tuna with rice, greens and other unique ingredients such as kale chips and fish skin, you can finally indulge cleanly without the guilt.

Looks like dark chocolate ice cream with similar texture. A blend of bananas, raw cacao &amp; soy milk topped with raw cacao nibs, blueberries, quinoa puffs, dark chocolate and coconut drizzle.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />The crunch from the raw cacao nibs was superbly chocolicious. However, as I was halfway thru, it got kinda \"jelak\" for me as the taste became one dimension. But having said that, this is what \"healthy\" taste like... without preservatives, colorings or sugars. A guilt free dessert that takes getting used to. \n<br />#dessert #dessertlovers #superfoods #smoothies #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #stfoodtrending #sgig #sgbloggers #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #igfollowers #instafollow #eatbooksg #eatliststar #cafesg #narratrs #topfoodnews #citynomads #healthy
