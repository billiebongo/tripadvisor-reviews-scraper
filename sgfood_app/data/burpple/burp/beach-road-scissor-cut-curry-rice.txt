Scissors Cut curry rice, I\'m sorry for not coming to you sooner. üò≠ After much discussion and hyped in office, we finally went to this place for the legendary curry rice. The glorious curry sauce over all the pork, chicken cutlets and chap chye is just downright satisfying. My advice is to not put a meeting after this meal.
Prices range between $3-$6. Just pile on whatever ya want! They are so popular for their sauce that people are asking whether they sell it!
Beach Road Scissor-cut Curry Rice
Nothing as comforting as a saucy plate of mixed curry rice at 9pm. We came here as it was one of the few supper places open till late and it was quite easy on the pocket. 
This place was so raved about, I had to make a trip down just to eat here! Expect a no-frills, cheap and hearty lunch here, with no fancy chairs or tables, and poor air ventilation. Just good comfort rice drowned in flavourful curry, black sauce and a heap load of chilli. While you enjoy each mouthful, expect to hear the busy snipping of scissors as they continuously dish out each new plate of rice and its ingredients. We ordered cabbage, bean sprouts, chicken cutlet, fried eggs, fish cake and braised pork, and everything was well cooked and flavourful. Just pick anything and it will taste so darn good with the heaps of sauce.
You can never go wrong with ordering anything on their menu here, because you ultimately come to enjoy their rice drowned in their 4 different sauces. I have to say, I absolutely loved their fried eggs and braised cabbage! Truly, a beautiful mess indeed.
Their ngo hiang is just super duper yummy with loads of chopped water chestnuts. But what makes is the best for me is the generous pour of thick strong-flavoured curry. My previous experience with Hainanese curry was always forgettable until I met this!
Man, these Burpple Tastemakers... I LOVE THEM üòÇ
The best thing about the tastemakers community is how we\'re always up for food - even if we just had an invited tastingüòÇ First time at the famous scissors curry rice which opens till late (3am?) and what a beautiful mess!! The ngoh hiang is pretty good and you don\'t always find one that has chunks of water chestnuts in it - and then there\'s the chapchye and pork cutlet that I really enjoyed. Everything\'s then drenched with thick, flavourful curry that isn\'t spicy nor overpowering. If this plate of curry rice isn\'t considered a comfort food, I don\'t know what is.
I love how with the Burpple Tastemakers community, a sinful supper doesn\'t seem like much of a crazy idea at all even though we just had a tasting! Have been wanting to try this and now that I\'ve did, the one word to describe it is SHIOK. I thought I was too full for a whole plate but nah, how do you resist a beautiful mess like this? Enjoyed the pork cutlet and ngoh hiang but I loved the thoroughly braised cabbage and magical concoction of curry + lor (braised sauce) drenched all over. Affordable, effortlessly tasty and so satisfying! #BurppleJalanBesar
The distinctive scissors clanking sound is clearly audible as you are nearing the shop, music to my ears, as the attendant taking your orders collects each item you have picked before cutting them up into smaller pieces and piling them on top of the rice. He then proceeds to add the finishing touch of 4 kinds of sauces; curry, braised gravy, chilli oil and chilli sauce on the mountain of food. If there\'s ever a Singaporean soulful food nomination, this definitely ranks high up the charts. Recommended items to get include the braised cabbage, pork belly and ngor hiang.
Don\'t be deceived by the messy appearance. This is THE curry rice. $3.40 for chicken cutlet, cabbage and fried egg with the ever overflowing gravy!! Must eat, people!!
The curry gravy was thick, spicy and fragrant. A variety of good ingredients to choose from,such as braised pork, long beans, pork cutlet. Do expect long queues on weekends.
Cheap and good curry rice. Includes rice + cabbage + chicken chop + curry gravy. Economical lunch option. To choose a healthier alternative, opt for less rice and less gravy. 
The things we had to do to get me here üôÉ was all worth it once I devoured this beautiful mess of curry sauces and the lovely, simple, PERFECT fried egg
Deep fried pork cutlet, chap chye (braised cabbage), ngoh Hiang (five spice meat roll), on top of plain rice, smoldered with lots of curry gravy. \n<br />All for $4.30.\n<br />Looked like a huge mess but one can finish  it effortlessly.\n<br />|\n<br />Beach Road Scissor-Cut Curry Rice ÁæéËäùÂæãÂâ™ÂàÄÂâ™ÂíñÂñ±È•≠\n<br />Address üè† : 229 Jalan Besar, Singapore üá∏üá¨ 208905\n<br />Tel ‚òéÔ∏è : 6292 3593\n<br />Open üíà : 11am-3.30am\n<br />MRT üöá : Farrer Park (NE8)
Pork chop was sold out! Settled with their chicken chop which was just as good. With the thick curry and Âç§Âë≥ sauce drizzled over my rice and overflowing plate, I was ready to devour this plate of goodness. 
Throngs of people at Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice during lunch.
Put any diet/eat-clean plans on pause, and triumphantly declare Friday as cheat day ‚Äî just so you can celebrate with a plate of scissors cut curry rice. Come here with a carefree spirit, and choose your ingredients with reckless abandon. Pile your plate high with classics ‚Äî from pork chops to braised cabbage, ngoh hiang to tau pok. This meal is cheap, darn good, and super satisfying. Set along the character-filled Jalan Besar, grab a roadside seat for the full experience. Don\'t hang around for too long though, there\'s probably a queue of people waiting for your seat. Go on, it\'s time for a beer.
Fast, efficient, no-frills and cheap! You queue up for the food and get served quickly. Pick your toppings from an array of meat and veg, and they top it with a gracious serving of curry gravy! Spent less than $5 for this giant dish.
This childhood favourite certainly calls for a surge of nostalgia. As a child, I would frequent this Scissors Cut Curry Rice stall with my parents, especially for supper since it is only a stone\'s throw away from where I live. It is not only my mum\'s favourite, my entire family loves it, even till today. I was told how my dad used to bring mummy on dates there, just because she once told him that she loves it, how unromantic! As a kid, I remember how the gooey mess on the plate totally did not appeal to me at first. But as time went by, I grew to love it! It may be a shame that I can no longer patronize the stall with both my parents again, but dining there with my boy today brings new meaning for me as I recall and share my fond childhood memories with him. #hawkerpedia

After work, when everyone starts to go home, and against the backdrop of noisy Jalan Besar traffic, I become hungry. As a Japanese living in Singapore, I sometimes get curious and feel like trying the curry rice below my office. What do you imagine when you think about curry rice? Indian curry? Japanese Curry? What does it look like? This curry is totally messy. The first time I ate this, I just thought, \"what\'s this!? Is this really curry? Looks like I\'m eating someone\'s leftovers\". That was the day I became addicted. Since then, I eat curry rice every month at this place. #hawkerpedia\n
This is just a bad representation of what your lunch should be after you exercise. I am just sacrificing my health to demonstrate this. Soft gooey rice that is slightly spicy, coupled with soft cabbage and braised pork...too bad the ngor hiang sold out but what can be more sinfully delightful than this? 
üòé: I am pretty sure many of you guys ate this plate of awesome curry rice before! This stall is just tuck away at a corner a lot Kitchener Road. Totally love the curry &amp; the spread of dishes to choose from! Was pretty shocked(a good one) by the price for egg, curry cabbage, ngoh hiang &amp; braised pork belly. Will definitely be back for more!\n<br />üí∞: S$4.5    \n<br />üíØ: [4/5] 
Ingredients stacked mountain high with braised sauce and curry, it was definitely a messy sight, but a good one. Curry was quite concentrated and rather flavorful, though not the spicy kind. Cabbage and ngoh hiang seems to be a popular choice, which tastes decent and the total price makes it pretty affordable too. 
Cheap and good! Curry isn\'t the chokingly spicy nor the full of chilli oil kind. Not exactly a great place to hang out because of the heat but it sure will fill your hunger and craving very well! 
That\'s ALL. The pork belly was infused with dark caramelized gravy and chicken soaked up hainanese curry. .\n<br />|\n<br />However, I felt that their fried pork and chicken chop tasted better in the past.
First time trying and I guess I am missing out a lot? Apart from their thick and luscious curry sauce drizzled over the braised sauce which makes it a true authentic Curry Rice (which is also why it is so good), I loved the Ngoh Hiang in particular; despite packed with less meat it has so much crunch from the water chestnuts filled within, and that braised pork that despite its leanness, matched well with the curry. Preferred the beansprouts over long beans; just felt that the texture and flavours worked better somehow.
It\'s the final push towards the end of the weekends. Don\'t battle the food coma and just indulge before getting some well-deserved rest to charge up for the upcoming week! Even though it looks messy and gooey, Scissors Cut Curry Rice is one of the many places that I always recommend to my overseas friends. 
VERY AFFORDABLE AND VALUE FOR MONEY! Generous portion of curry and very nice ingredients üòä! 
\"Very cheap and nice!\", the taxi driver said about this place. If there\'s one thing I\'ve learnt, it\'s that the true hawker foodies in Singapore are taxi drivers and indeed, the curry rice didn\'t fail us.  Generous servings of curry and ingredients at a ridiculously low price. I ordered a vegetable and two meat side dishes at only $3.60. The selection of side dishes would appeal to the more carnivorous crowd as the store offers a wider selection of meaty sides. Curry rice always makes a very hearty meal (:
untung hotel kali ini tidak terlalu jauh dari sini. üòõüòùüòú Selamat Makan!
No idea how to make this sloppy mess look as good as it tastes. But man, did this hit the spot. Was even cheaper than I expected, too, at just $4.60 for chicken cutlet, egg, ngoh hiang and fishcake on rice.
Such a messy plate of goodness. Not nutritionist approved, but no one is counting calories today. Love their black pork chop, ngoh hiang, tau pok and cabbage!
How can anyone not love this? Rice + black pork chop + tau pok + ngoh hiang + cabbage and topped with black sauce and curry. ‚ò∫Ô∏è total bliss. 
Finally checked it out before I end my internship in Burpple!!! The tastes is great:) I m thinking whether it helps in coding tho cuz my supervisor eats it everyday lol...anyway I will be back nxt time hopefully there\'s less Q. Miss the Êâ£ËÇâ n ÁÇ∏ËÇâ alr!! 
Why having a messy plate of curry rice can be a good thing? 
I had French beans + cabbage + pork cutlet with the flavourful thick curry and sauces! 
Woooohoooo comfort food!((: I don\'t care that it doesn\'t look good in pictures.. All that matters is that it tastes awesome!
One does not simply go there and not order shit. Beer goggles apparently works on food too.
It\'s quite hard to explain what\'s this mess, but it\'s like curry gravies over chicken wing, veg, pork and egg on top of rice.
It\'s been a long time since I had this for dinner. The taste is still the same as the 1st time I had many years ago. Simple dishes but the curry is main attraction.
Disgustingly good even with all the weird various sauces mixed together!
üòçüòçüòçüòç this is ought to be the best curry rice. #beachroadcurryrice #curryrice #burpple
Some of the ugliest gooey food can taste so good
With tel for movies and lunch! ^^ omnomnom I love #sgfood
Hello folks! For dinner, I had the best curry rice in town! Soft, fluffy rice topped with generous servings of the ingredients of your choice and slathered with tasty, velvety curry. My favorite! Verdict: 8.5/10 üòç
I love the light curry. It goes well with all the side dishes, and you\'ll crave for more! 
I seem to prefer the one from Let\'s Eat üòÇ It didn\'t leave any impression on me ü§î Digging through the dish doesn\'t make me crave for more, I find it overall pretty bland üò• Maybe it\'s just me? Or perhaps it gains popularity because it\'s cheap? I paid $2.60 only for chicken chop and cabbage üòÜ

Choose your ingredients! My faves are braised pork belly, cabbage, egg, tau pork, squid. Everything became messy beyond recognition after the copious amount of thick gao curry sauce was poured onto it.

Chose fried pork chop, chicken chop and egg. Both the meat were relatively thin and hard, I could hardly tell the difference. The saving grace was that sedap curry gravy! 2 different types of curry gravy soaking all the dishes which tasted light yet robust in flavor. It\'s slight spiciness is easy to handle. We all agreed that the curry alone is sufficient for us to wipe the entire plate clean! \n<br />#whati8today #8dayseat #i8mondays #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #setheats #buzzfeedfood #feastagram #sgfoodie #instafood_sg #peanutloti #starvingtime #thesmartlocal #tslmakan

A golden rule in food; never judge food from its plating! The most undesirable and underrated plating might turn it to be the best tasting food you\'ve ever eaten. Conversely, I have experienced many times of nicely plated food that\'s a feast for the eyes but fall short of expectations.\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice\n<br />Address: 229, Jalan Besar, Singapore 208905\n<br />‚Ä¢\n<br />#yoursingapore #visitsingapore #singapore #burpproved #buzzfeast #buzzfeedfood #makansutra #hawkerhopping #hawkerspotlight #sghawkersrock
This has got to be one of the most comforting meals in the whole of Singapore! The famous Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice. The craze is really understandable - a purposeful mess of curry upon a large plate of mixed food of your choice. I got their famous chicken cutlet, eggs, sambal mini mussels &amp; a definite MUST ORDER is the cabbage. The food just blended and went so well with each other and basically any food item on display will go well with that thick and generous serving of curry. This came up to $4.90 nett for such a satisfying plate of goodness. Albeit the non-existent ambience + heat &amp; the rude service rendered by the cashier auntie, I\'ll definitely head back again for more! A must try comfort food! Best thing is that they open till 3.30am for night owls!
Yeaaaaaa.. So much for getting in shape üôÑ
