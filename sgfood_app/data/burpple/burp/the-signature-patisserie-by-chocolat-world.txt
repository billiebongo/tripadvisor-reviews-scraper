Muffins aren\'t really my groove, but if they\'re like these banana muffins, I could make this a regular thing! 🍌
Pardon the less than prettay picture, think all I wanted to do was to dig into this sinful mess. 😝
Waffles with scrambled eggs, turkey and chicken ham($12) \n<br />Iced Americano($4)
Babies seems to naturally bond with others and we adults don\'t know what they were talking to each other. It\'s always interesting to learn something new from other parents! We went someone we haven\'t tried before and this was French Toast with Kari Kapitan. Oh they have colorful Keropok too! 😃
We had 3 servings in that last stop of #TastyTasteMakerTour !! 😱 No doubt because that was just sooo good. 👌🏻\n<br />#burpple #tastytastemakertour #TTT #simplejoys
Who wouldn\'t be happy for Alfrero gelato? This dessert is surely a devil for tempting us! 😈\n<br />As recommended by the tastemakers, let the Baileys gelato melt and let the cake be soaked with it. The fusion made the cake even more interesting because of the lingering \'alcoholic feel\' it creates in your mouth! Desserts here are worth the travel! 🤤\n<br />#burpple #tastytastemakertour #bukittimahfoodtour #simplejoys
The banana muffin has thin slices of real banana that made an impression of homemade goodness. The chocolate muffin has oozy chocolate filling which added to the excitement! They were served warm, moist and fluffy! Oh so satisfyingly good. 💕\n<br />#burpple #tastytastemakertour #bukittimahfoodtour #TTT
Dark chocolate chips melt into warmed chocolate cake, balancing the sweetness of the fluffy light slices that sit under scoops of Alfero gelato.\n<br />.\n<br />Bacio, combining chocolate and hazelnut makes a milky coat over your tongue. Taste Baileys to feel like you\'re eating instead of drinking it as alcohol lingers in your mouth. Creamy sweet liquer intertwines with the almost fudgey chocolate cake as it melts. Pistachio, delicate and nutty while pleasurably creamy and weighty, is positively my favourite flavour of sin.\n<br />.\n<br />Wave away the waffles at @thesignaturepatisserie with the Black Devil Chocolate Cake ($9 with a single scoop of Alfero Gelato, $12 with two scoops), you can have your cake and eat gelato too.\n<br />.\n<br />Full review: http://bit.do/herecomesgin-the-signature-patisserie
