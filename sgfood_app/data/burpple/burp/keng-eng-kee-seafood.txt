When this arrived on the table, I thought it\'s just a honey or sweet black sauce pork. It turned out to be chicken that was coated with honey plus coffee smell. I have no idea how they cooked it but it\'s a really interesting menu üòÉ
Moonlight Hor Fun.
This was fresh &amp; tender, not overcooked and came in a lovely dark unami sauce, would have loved it 100% if it didn\'t also have a thick layer of oil.
Favourite dish! Came hot &amp; crispy, with loads of crunchy water chestnuts in the filling. ‚ù§
Moonlight Hor Fun has been part of KEK‚Äôs menu since the 1960‚Äôs when they were still at Havelock Road. The star here is the wok hei ‚Äì so excellent! 
This is the ultimate favourite snac- I mean dish for my team to order when we come to KEK. If the other dishes don\'t arrive soon enough after this is served, half of the sotongs would be gone before we even start the meal. So moreish, so crispy. 
I actually prefer the marmite chicken over the team fave of coffee ribs mostly because the flavours are more subtle and it is not as jelak. Also, I love all things marmite. These are deeeelicious, sticky and I could happily just have this with a bowl of rice. 
Must eat the moonlight horfun it\'s so good. The dry horfun tastes kinda like charkwayteow and is topped with a cute lil egg yolk 3.75/5
KEK is one of those zi char places that we would gladly return to. With its friendly and prompt service, consistently flavourful dishes and plenty of seating to accommodate large groups, it\'s the foolproof option for those living in the West. Order the Moonlight Hor Fun (from $5) ‚Äî hor fun full of wok hei cooked with Chinese sausage, prawns, beansprouts and lard, finished with a raw egg that completely transforms the dish when you mix it in. The Fried Salted Egg Crab is another crowd favourite, think fresh crab tossed in a thick, buttery salted egg sauce with the right amount of spicy! The Coffee Ribs ($8) are a hit with the customers too ‚Äî tender on the inside, and glazed with a sweet, sticky coffee sauce. Pro tip: these dishes pair great with a crisp white wine. Bring a bottle along if you\'re celebrating (corkage charge of $5 per bottle)! \n<br />Avg Price: $15 per person \n<br />Photo by Burppler Keropok Man
I just love my calamari and when it\'s prepared with salted egg.. lagi best.. what\'s great is that the batter retained its crispiness and the salted egg wasn\'t too over powering.. putting the entire plate in front of me wasn\'t a good idea at all haha #burpple #nofilter #iphone7plus #happiness #whileimwaitingfortheloml #lomljns #lomljnck
salted fish pork belly and claypot taufu... very rich in taste  #burpple #zichar
This hor fun was too sweet for my liking. I prefer my noodles more savoury.
Classmates since we were that tiny and we meet once a year.
This marmite chicken is simply delicious. The sauce is just perfect - not too sweet, not too salty.
These delectable crispy sotong was akin to Italian styled calamari. $18 for what they labeled as small but turned out to be a pretty generous portion. Totally worth the lipids
Some zichar for celebration! Came for the famed Dried Horfun, Ming Zhu rolls and Coffee ribs. Wasn\'t too impressed though. Horfun was too salty &amp; oily, Ming zhu rolls were flat in terms of flavour, while coffee pork ribs was too sweet. üòï meh. Not counted. I should look for another celebratory meal. üòú #Burpple #burpplesg #zichar #kengengkee #horfun
Pop the moon (or moons, if you order large üòÅ) to coat the piping hot strands of wok hei-kissed noodles for that extra layer of slippery lusciousness, then enjoy it with chunks of fried lard, sliced squid, peeled prawns and veggies. Still my favourite horfun to date!
Deep fried squid rings tossed in salted egg sauce, chilli padi and curry leaves. Crunchy pieces that\'s encrusted in salted egg batter, ADDICTIVE~
So I have managed to find out that if you like prawns but hate to deshell prawns, KEK Seafood Alexandra actually offers deshelled variants at no extra cost. If you are a salted egg fan, then perhaps you should try any of the salted egg dishes especially if you love \'me saucey. It gets a little jelak after a while, but fans will probably enjoy that thick yet balanced salted egg flavour coated on the crisply fried and plump prawns. Today\'s curry leaves weren\'t as crisp as I would have expected it to be, but they were still immensely flavourful and hit the taste buds well enough.
I would always prefer dry variants of noodles, but dad prefers soupy kinds; since I have yet to try the usual Hor Fun at KEK Seafood Alexandra, we decided to give it a go. The gravy for the Hor Fun here is slightly on the lighter side, while the Hor Fun was clumpy on certain areas. Personally, I would have preferred a heavier tasting gravy that carries more wok hei though I must say they have done well on the part of the Hor Fun where the noodles carried the wok hei and savoury flavours instead ‚Äî think their signature Moonlight Hor Fun thrown in a light-tasting Hor Fun gravy instead. Not sure if I am the only one who thinks this way, but I would prefer having the dry items for they seemed to be executed way better than their wet counterparts at KEK Seafood Alexandra.
Some things are to die for, and after heading to Timbre+ for Open Stoves where I had try the Gar√ßons x KEK Seafood collaboration I knew I needed to make my way down to KEK Seafood Alexandra just for their coffee pork ribs. The first time I have had this was at the STREAT event in 2015 at Collyer Quay and I am just amazed at their level of consistency for it was all I remembered it for; tender, juicy pork ribs coated in a aromatic, sticky and subtly sweet coffee sauce ‚Äî it gets so addictive that whenever this dish appears at the table, everyone simply forgets the existence of the other dishes around. I think I probably have said it once, but it\'s definitely a must-order if one ever visits KEK Seafood.
Believe it or not, it\'s my second time ordering this at KEK Seafood Alexandra but I have never ever been able to come out with a conclusion which is the better of the lot ‚Äî these Prawn Balls or the Coffee Pork Ribs. It\'s been such a nasty scenario choosing one out of the two so again we ordered both. These are great; the chunkiness, the crunchiness within and crispness of the exterior but it gets better when you dip them into the sweet, malty dip at the side. Another must-try at KEK Seafood Alexandra!
After that the Roll will be deep fried . This dish u must eat when it is piping hot so that ensure that the taupok stuff with item is good &amp; filling. Can order in Small Medium Large. $12, $16 , $20 respectively. maybe 1 or 2 is nt enough for group maybe 2 large plate which is enough for abt 10 ppl ?
Although Salted Egg dishes viral everywhere in here. Look like the Chef make a good perfection on their salted egg crab. The Stall Owner insisted of using SRI Lanka Crab. Advanced Order is required to avoid disappointment. Tel Phone Number 62721038.
.. So then I took my turn\n<br />Oh what a thing to have done\n<br />And it was all yellow
Drooling as I think back how delicious this simple plate of horfun is. Flat noodles stir fried with ingredients like prawns, squid, chinese sausage and bean sprouts until they are slightly charred. Break the raw egg and ensure each noodles are cloaked, amplifying the taste of this Zi Char dish. SLURP~
It was OT night and this was impromptu. Only three of us, we ordered 3 dishes - Moonlight Hor Fun, Claypot Pig\'s Liver, and (not in picture) Mingzhu Rolls. The raw egg gives the Hor Fun an extra glaze without much use of starch and broth bringing out the stronger wok hei, while there is something mysterious about the dark sauce for the Liver which makes it all good to go with white rice! Though I always love dining here (they are open for lunch and accept big groups), I think consistency of making dishes good is challenging. Really satisfying dinner though!
When I was walking past there. I saw many Diner Order Their Signature Stir-Fried Thin Beehoon Crab.Look Like Every Table Order that. Finally I really did went with @debbiehuang @kenn_evans &amp; with their indonesia friend @julioioio. The Stall Owner told me that I gotta to order the crab in advanced as they want limit the stock so that the crab is fresh. The Crab is from Sri Lanka. The Bee Hoon infused with the stock is Good making it Q not too soggy. Usually Dinner is always crowded Call to Order the Crab to avoid dissappointment. @jiaknonstop The Stir Crab Bee Hoob is good man gotta bring u there eat soon man. The Crab cost u $68 Per Kg. Reservation is Recommended for the Crab.
KEK\'s spring onion and ginger venison is simply sumptuous. There\'s no trace of gaminess, and as a matter of fact, if I was served this at a blindfolded taste test, I would\'ve mistaken this for beef. It\'s tender, well marinated and the accompanying sauce is superbly savory and luscious, resulting in this place of venison being cleaned in record timing.
A visit to Keng Eng Kee simply wouldn\'t be complete without having the top KEK dish of moonlight hor fun. It\'s undoubtedly the most wok hei laden plate of hor fun I\'ve ever had thus far. It\'s chock full of savory, sublime flavors and stuffed to the gills with lup cheong and assorted seafood. Even my dad, who has astronomical standards for zi char, was duly impressed by this $5 plate of perfection that\'s more loaded than Arnold Schwarzenegger was in Commando. Mix in the raw egg yolk into the already impeccable hor fun and be prepared to take a road trip on the freeway to Flavortown.
Delicious and affordable kway teow for 2. $8 for medium. Other good dishes to try: coffee ribs, three eggs spinach and mingzhu roll.
when chinese supplier is in town and wanna a local feel, KEK. diplomatically, they have the giantic meatiest pincers. that sacrifice right
Fortunately, we came at the right time and didn\'t have to queue if not our tummies will be making so much noise that it will awaken the sleepy quiet rows of residential flats beside it. With chock full of goodies like fish slices, sotong, prawns, Chinese sausages and the all important fried kway teow, this is one dinner that you will gladly make the long trip down for. Two raw eggs are dropped in the middle and you have to mix it thoroughly so that each strip of kway teow is coated evenly with the egg mixture.
For the much acclaimed Moonlight Horfun (from $5), which is name so as you\'ll find raw egg on top resembling the moon. Smokey wok hei aroma and slightly peppery yet the sweet dark sauce balance it. This dish is good that you\'ll lick your plate clean within minutes.
If you\'re a fan of hor fun, dishes full of wok hei and basically good zi char, this is the place! We had the medium sized for 2 and slurped them all up quickly. It\'s not that hard to understand why once you\'ve tried it. The amount of dark soy sauce used seems a lot more than the usual ones you find, but the balance was on point. Breaking the egg yolk and folding it in made the hor fun even more smooth and slippery.
Fried Beancurd skin wrapping egg, ham and mushrooms like a Chinese form of burger. 
I started eating pig livers only quite recently, after being encouraged to try it during a bak kut teh meal. I got hooked! This was my first time trying them being cooked in this manner and I know I will be coming back. Livers overcooked are the worst but Keng Eng Kee did it like a pro. The texture was just right and the braised sauce is another part worth mentioning - so robust, flavorful and perfect with rice! 
These prawn rolls come in 3 different sizes - Small ($8), Medium ($12), Large ($16) - with the same number of pieces per dollar. You can tell that it is homemade by the taste of the minced meat and the individual pieces of cabbage and carrot in it that fell apart upon each bite. One of the dishes to order, but perhaps just getting a small one would do. 
Highlight: Moonlight Hor Fun [Medium - $8.00]\n<br />Fried with glorious lard and full of flavour, this ÊãõÁâå dish is a must order. Really like the texture of the hor fun and it was also seasoned and browned very nicely. The cracked egg on top was reminiscent of my quest to cook a classic carbonara, which contains no cream btw (I digress). 
Look at that shade of golden brown.  Keng Eng Kee is always so crowded and for good reason, dishing out really good Cze Char dishes.  Someone say Wok Hei.
Think Moonlight Hor Fun, Coffee Ribs, Salted Egg Yolk Sotong and my favourite the Prawn Rolls (Hei Zhor) and Har Cheong Gai. Table was quietly cleared within minutes, with occasion \"fwah\" and \"this is... omnomnomnom so good\" Definitely one of the best Zi Char around, finally one of the Zi Char place where everything is so darn good! Boneless Har Jeong Kai are the best invention everrrrrr! Especially shared with a good team of food lovers! #bestfoodmemory2015
People might frown upon hearing this - zi char and wine? What a weird pairing?

I don\'t know why I hadn\'t been, but I totally don\'t get it how I didn\'t think of trying this despite walking by so many times to have something else along the way. It\'s insane how they can do this so well; that slurpy hor fun in dark sauce that makes it have a short whiff of sweetness amidst all the wok hei and that slight peppery flavour for a small hint of spiciness. And that raw yolk that you are suppose to burst and mix in so everything becomes silky and slippery. Oh so good!
This was how Salted Egg Squids should be done; the crisp, light batter encases calamari which weren\'t any bit rubbery, while the sauce carries just enough salted egg flavour without being too salty nor sweet and cooked dry enough that it sticks to the batter of the squids. Definitely more satisfying than the other one I had the other day.
Had tried these at a pop-up event at Clifford Square earlier this year and was rather impressed by how it was, but this just went up the next level. These were utterly tender and soft to bite, while carrying heavy caramalised flavours with a short hint of coffee within that sticky, sweet sauce that the ribs are coated in. The first piece in and it would definitely make you crave for more!
These were surprisingly light, for the batter is thin yet crisp while it encases loosely packed meat that does not require too much an effort to chew, but still carries enough savouriness. 
Fried flat rice noodles slicked with raw eggs that adds to the overall flavor and texture.  Simply delectable! \n<br />T\'was a gorge fest at Keng Eng Kee with the JC pals last night.  It\'ll be our 20 years anniversary next year!
At first I thought it looks like something I\'d find in a Japanese bento. Haha üòÑ Visually pleasing but tasted pretty normal. It was stated on the menu: fried tau pok stuffed with salted egg yolk, prawn, ham, mushrooms and parsley. You can just imagine how it tastes like.
I finally understood why Moonlight Horfun is so sought-after. If I stay near Keng Eng Kee, I\'d have this every week. The horfun was full of \'wok hei\' and the dark soy sauce added color and sweetness to the dish. Besides slices of Chinese sausage, there were crispy pork lards, prawns, slices of fish and squid. All these for just $8!
This is a must-try at Keng Eng Kee. The crunchiness from water chestnuts and carrots, sweetness of prawns and minced pork.. üòö
Many would usually order prawn paste chicken at zi char stalls but at Keng Eng Kee, I strongly recommend Marmite Chicken. 
I was surprised to find six big prawns since I ordered the smallest portion. The drunken prawns were sweet and succulent. Totally love the Chinese wine taste of the prawns. üòã The soup was flavorful and the overall deep herbal and Chinese wine taste won me over. Êàë‰πüÊòØÈÜâ‰∫Ü üòç
KEK is one of those rare zi char places with friendly and prompt service, and it\'s perfect for big groups of friends or for a family gathering. Expect simple, homely dishes that are big on flavour, such as the Moonlight Hor Fun ($5/8/12/16) ‚Äî lush wok hei hor fun with Chinese sausage, prawns, beansprouts and lard, finished with a raw egg that completely transforms the dish when you mix it in. The Fried Salted Egg Crab is another crowd favourite, think fresh crab tossed in a \"thick, buttery salted egg sauce with a hint of spiciness\", as Tastemaker Marc T. describes. The Coffee Ribs ($8) are a hit as well, tender on the inside, and glazed with a sweet, sticky coffee sauce. There are both outdoor and indoor seating, make sure you call ahead for reservations!
Good to come early or make reservations, otherwise be prepared to queue. Really observant and friendly staff too üëç
Crispy on the outside &amp; fluffy on the inside, pretty awesome yam ring though the ingredients could be done better ($25)
Has that sought after wok hei, but was a tad too salty when we had it ($5)
A must try dish here! Love the coffee sauce so much!
This was really good! I prefer it to the signature moonlight hor fun. 
This is quite a famous eatery. The owner is my uncle\'s friend. üêª \'s fav üíó fried spicy kang kong with cuttlefish,  the best is with lots of crispy pork lard lol .
A dish that would throw you off any diet. The fried horfun or as the restaurant calls it, ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥Á≤â, is an absolute spectacle. With the runny egg yolk stirred into a plate of wok hei-ed noodles with Chinese sausage, lard, prawns, beansprouts and more, you\'re definitely in for a yummy treat.
|\n<br />One of the most worth eating dish. The rib was tender in the inside and its outside was grazed with the sweet and sticky coffee sauce. .\n<br />|\n<br />Even before we took a bite, the smell of the coffee had caused us to drool non stop! üòçüòçüòç
$8 for two to share. Felt the noodles were too tough and chewy. Very oily with many pork lard pieces.
SALTED EGG CRAB YAYYYY. Ordered salted egg squid too which we threw into this plate after clearing the crabs!! üòåüòåüòå Wiped the plate clean hahaha (üì∑: @angella91)
4.5 munchies: The thick, buttery salted egg sauce with a hint of spiciness won me over instantly. It was so good that I had to get a spoonful of the sauce each bite of the fresh and sweet crab! Other than some crab meat that was stuck to the shell, I could not find any fault with the dish. I\'d love to try the Steamed Salted Egg Crab and, of course, the Moonlight Hor Fun again, on my next visit.
4.5 munchies: This was the dish I was most looking forward to tasting at this family-run restaurant and I\'m glad that it didn\'t disappoint. The raw egg nestled in the middle of the stir fried hor fun, lup cheong (Chinese sausage), prawns, squid and crispy lard added a smooth texture and gave the dish a glossy sheen when you mix everything together. This will be worth the minimum waiting time of 30 mins!
3 munchies: These nicely caramelised pork ribs may not look like they\'ve been coated with coffee powder and oyster sauce at first sight, but one could identify the dish from the coffee aroma the moment it lands on the table. As a coffee lover, I\'d have liked the taste of the coffee to be stronger. Unfortunately, the inside of the pork ribs was also dry from deep frying them for too long.
always a fan of keng eng kee and you can always bet on a legion of fans on a weekend dinner. waited 20 minutes but so worth it cause the ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥Á≤â is insanely gold here - prawns and \"lup cheong\" in abundance but most important of all, crispy fragrant pork lard in abundance too. toss in the raw egg, and enjoy it o-so-smooth amidst the unmistakable smokey wok hei on the \"fan\" and the crunch of pork lard. happiness at only $8
A raw egg tossed into well fried flat rice noodles.  Quite nice I must say. Although the people there suck at telling you how much to order/ or when to stop.
Told to expect 30 mins wait for food. Happy for both Paul &amp; Wayne, HUAT Ah.
i know it doesnt look anything picture worthy but these golden mess is highly recommended - salted egg crab BUT you must have it steamed instead. the freshness and sweetness of the crustacean still overwhelms like a tsunami wave hitting your buds despite the hardest the divine molten salted egg sauce tried. this plate was cleaned to the plate man, nothing was spared. it was that good!
laws of attraction apply! i wanted crab and look, black pepper crab! lol. cause team appreciation dinner and boss paid, so we had crabs. see the claw there? yea i had that. the whole of that claw with its white glistering meat came off intact, effortlessly. that seafood freshness was ecstasy!
zi char in our family is never crabs and soup for our dearest mum would niam for days on end how expensive the dishes were. even with her passing a year on, we still do not order. *bitter laugh*. oh well, like i said, serving here is generous for the price. marmite chicken looks more sweet sour pork to us though. no matter what, keng eng kee got dad\'s approval.
sunday family dinner zi char at keng eng kee. really enjoyed the ÊùæÈ±ºÂ§¥ at chinatown, so had some expectations from a famous zi char place. alas, the sauce and pork lard on the whole was meek in comparison and couldnt mask well the freshwater fish\'s muddy taste. nevertheless, good hearty portion for the price and serves decently for a family of 7
Okay, I remember this used to be a lot better and crisper. A little disappointing this time round.

Mixed platter of KEK\'s specialties. Mingzhu Rolls, Prawn Rolls and You Tiao. Found it a tad too oily and repetitive though. #burpple
The star dish of the night, Salted Egg Crab (Fried)!! The sauce was extremely delish and the roe in the crab head was heavenly! #burpple
Nice soft fluffy buns to go with the chili crab! Tasted great with the chili crab gravy! #burpple
Tender chicken pieces well cooked in this marmite sauce. Crispy, Crunchy, Sweet and Savory.

When you say zi char, I say seafood. While everyone else is busy ooh-ing and aah-ing over their har jeong kai and prawn rolls, I\'m busy stuffing myself silly on their strikingly savory sambal sotong. Fantastically fresh with the satisfying snap upon bite to prove it, it was coated in a piquant, spicy sambal sauce that brought more than enough heat to stimulate the senses, yet not enough to commission the opening of Nose Waterworks Inc. And considering that this is the smallest portion, Keng Eng Kee are pretty darn generous with the serving of squid. Simply said, this sambal sotong is spicy, springy, satisfying and simply superb.

Finally giving it a try! Be prepared to wait for at least 30-40mins on a weekend. But it\'s worth the wait. This plate of goodness has so much wok-hei and flavour üî•üòã
they look like pre-baked croissant rolls but omg. they were GOOD, especially when dipped in Chilli Crab gravy. I even used it to sponge up all the remaining sauce from the Salted Egg Yolk Crab üòãüòãüòã @igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporefood #singaporeeats #hawkerfood @sgfoodie @singaporeeats #kengengkee #zichar #mantou
this has got to be my all-time favourite - the Coffee Pork Ribs. after all these years, the quality of food has maintained its standard and when there were just tooooo much leftover food, I made it MY job to lick clean this plate üòã

Keng Eng Kee\'s Salted Egg Crab is deemed by many as the best in Singapore. I think the Chilli Crab is equally as good. Please read my full review at www.hungeyghost.sg
