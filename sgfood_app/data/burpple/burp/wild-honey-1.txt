Despite the lack of review for this dish, I decided to be adventurous and try this. Flinder\'s lane ($25) is a combination of mallawach (tasted like air-fried crispy roti prata) + 2 beautiful poach eggs + generous feta + slices of avocado + misc asparagus and tomatoes. Nom nom nom very satisfying! Highly recommended for brain food lovers! Xoxo, wet tissue no have (but got pretty napkins üòò)
PRE-monday lazy lazy brunch.\n<br />No reservation made as it was lazy brunch.
\"Careful, the pan is hot\" are words I like to hear. Immediately, I envision the dish being taken right off the fire or out of the oven to be brought straight to the customer. Surely, food doesn\'t get more freshly cooked than that. The \"Tunisian\" is a fine example. It wasn\'t my order but after sneaking a couple of bites, I wouldn\'t hesitate to have it in the future.\n<br />This substantial all-day-breakfast item has two eggs and slices of chorizos baked in a tangy, spicy \"shakshouka\" (it\'s essentially a stew made with chopped up tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and red chillies). Best way to do it justice is to tear off a chunk from the toasted brioche, swoosh it in the pan to break the egg yolks first, then use it to soak and scoop a hefty helping of the thickened deliciousness up to your mouth. Mmmmmmm.....
One of Wild Honey\'s bestsellers, the \"Parisienne\" is a dish where my first bite was divine, and the subsequent ones, even better. Nothing on the plate was superfluous as each element contributed to the stellar whole. \n<br />I was smittened by the cushions of brioche that had been slit, stuffed with leg ham, gruyere cheese and a swipe of Dijon mustard, then dunked in an egg wash before being introduced to the grill with plenty of butter. As though that\'s not rich enough, the hot sandwiches were topped with two fried eggs and a stunning hollandaise sauce - pure decadence with a twinge of tang.\n<br />Creating equlibrium with the savoury was delicate sweetness from the salad dressing and a pair of large, plump tomatoes on the vine (hidden from view in my photo).\n<br />If you aren\'t a big eater, I recommend sharing this as the portion is hearty.
I... they\'re not exactly Belgian in texture, really. But the mango and coconut mix on top is tropical in a nice, if slightly touristy, way.
After what seemed like forever, I returned today to Wild Honey for brunch. However, instead of selecting one of their famous breakfasts inspired by different countries around the world, I had a \"Curly Kale Caesar\" instead. \n<br />Crowned with non-oily sweet potato chips and a poached egg, the heap of kale was just right in terms of texture (I don\'t like it when it\'s too fibrous). Tossed in a lemon-anchovy dressing that I found a shade salty but nonetheless, still palatable, the kale was accessorised with shaved Parmesan, a few large croutons, pine nuts and crisp prosciutto. Expect punctuations of sweetness thanks to the dried cranberries scattered within.
I had something similar to this a long time ago at Penny University Cafe but theirs had cool yogurt instead of a warm one. With two eggs, their portion was bigger and came seasoned with Moroccan harissa.\n<br />I did still like Wild Honey\'s version though, as it\'s flavourful from the inclusion of baby spinach and paprika oil. Served alongside were toasted flatbread for dipping and saucers of \"avjar\" (a type of red bell pepper relish) and an Israeli salad.\n<br />Oh, and we had to get a side order of Canadian back bacon ($8++) just because.
Saut√©ed mushrooms, grilled potatoes &amp; tomato made the signature brioche so yummy! The bacon was so-so &amp; the pork sausage was too tough. Baked beans with chicken chucks would have wowed baked bean lover but sadly I\'m not one üòú\n<br />üçû
Tried it with the chocolate ice cram this time. And it was really nice. The brioche toast was crispy and soft on the inside. A must try!
Really soft and light. Loved the raspberry jam in between the layers. Worth a try!
Had to request for more coconut cream as the cream sandwiched between the waffles was so little. The syrup that came with it was disappointing as it tasted like plain sugar syrup. Maple syrup would have been nicer.
This scone felt like those ready made packaged scones you put in the oven to reheat. While the scone was crusty on the outside, the inside was still cold and too dry. The clotted cream tasted stale and the strawberry preserve was no biggy.
Soft and moist. Lemon curd layer was nice with the sweet cream layers.
Chose the salted caramel ice cream from \n<br />a choice of 4 flavours and it was the best choice ever. The ice cream went well with the crispy but fluffy brioche toast and the caramel sauce drizzled over it was perfect. Worth a try indeed!
I had breakfast for dinner. :D 
I couldn\'t hear you over the anticipation for my hot chocolate.
Decent french toast with mangoes sandwiched instead the toast. Wish there was more mangoes though. A little pricey for $20 too. But the maple syrup and berry compote went well with it.
Decent french toast with mango stuffing although I wish there was more mangoes. A bit pricey for $20 although the maple syrup and berry compote went well with it.
Loved how the poached eggs went so well with the filo pastry and avocados. This is one of the more interesting brunch items at Wild Honey. A must try!
This dish was delicious beyond believe. Not too expensive and I will absolutely go back to have this again. Eggy, sweet and slightly tart. Delicious.
Hand churned salted caramel, chocolate ice cream sandwich between brioche French toast.\n<br />Price: $12
Creamy scrambled eggs with smoked sturgeon, smoke salmon &amp; caramelised onions with hard rolled sesame bagel.
The full works. Eggs any style, Canadian back bacon, Korobuta pork sausage, dad\'s baked beans, saut√©ed mushrooms, breakfast potatoes, grilled vine tomatoes &amp; signatures brioche. 
Spicy shakshouka (onion tomato bell pepper &amp; red Chili) chorizo baked eggs signature brioche Israeli salad.
Lovely brunch at Wild Honey Mandarin Gallery. Eggs were cooked just right with just enough mustard dressing! Loved it!

Looking for all day breakfast meal?? Check out Wild Honey at either Scotts Square or Mandarin Gallery. \n<br />We had the traditional English Breakfast ($22) and Tunisian Breakfast ($18). I think Wild Honey serves the best breakfast ever. We really had no complains about the food. Everything was very filling and delicious.\n<br />YOU MUST TRY THE TUNISIAN OMG. \n<br />Truth to be told, I almost wanted to order another one of it. It was that good!! Honestly, the prices isn\'t that cheap, but for the ambience and food, it\'s so worth it.
Sweet Morning [S$18] Twice cooked signature brioche French toast with grilled mango, vanilla bean mascarpone &amp; hibiscus-berry compote. So delicious! Oh, and if you\'re thinking twice about coming here because of expensive parking, spend a min of S$30 to redeem 2 hours free parking at Mandarin Gallery! First come first served.
Yums..didn\'t reserve this time but the wait was bearable - 10min
It\'s Wild Honey Day! Yums..didn\'t reserve this time but the wait was bearable - 10min.
Revisited Wild Honey (an all-day brunch spot that requires no introductions) after almost a year and it seems like they\'ve revamped their menu to keep up with the endlessly competitive food scene. This Aussie-styled breakfast platter of massive proportions include a 150g hunk of grilled rump steak, sunny side up, breakfast potatoes, baked beans, saut√©ed mushrooms, fat juicy tomatoes on the vine, bell pepper compote, tomato chutney and a chargrilled slice of ciabatta.(try saying this sentence in one breadth)  And as if this wasn\'t already enough to feed an entire family, we went on to add-up their candied back bacon strips which tasted mighty like Bak-Kua. I never expected it, but this meal was in many ways, immensely satisfying. \n<br />35bucks/plate
Savoury French Toast stuffed with Dijon mustard, leg ham and Gruyere, topped with a couple of sunny sides, creamy hollandaise and an arugula salad dressed lightly with mustard balsamic vinaigrette. (Request for maple syrup to add that extra oompf to your savoury breakfast.) I never expected it, but this meal was in many ways, immensely satisfying. \n<br />24bucks/plate
Soft bread to dip in brown tomato based sauce with poached eggs.. Yums
probably the best french toast I\'ve tried so far but it was really expensive, paid almost $30 for this
English Breakfast ($25++)
Major ‚ù§ for the absolutely yummy brioche &amp; the hot chocolate served in that quaint pot
A cafe with breakfast from all over the globe in 1 stop! English breakfast (top left), Parisienne (top right), I love NY (bottom)
We ordered English (SGD 22) and Norwegian(SGD 25). Sausage and crumbled eggs are really delicious. Canadian bacon and smoked salmon are awesome!!!

Brunch. Choose english breakfat because there is scramble egg, sausage and ham !
Nice place, cozy sofa, nice coffee, all kinds of breakfast set, puffy chocolate. All the things make your life be slow. With friends n chatting a afternoon. All the breakfast around $20. Good place to go.
Ottoman ($22++) is just my type of breakfast. I won\'t say no to a hearty pan of shakshouka! Tomatoes, vegetables and poached eggs just swim their way to my heart. 
Well I\'d definitely love to try all the amazing breakfasts at Wild Honey if not for the high price tags. SoCal ($22++) is a healthier choice out of the extensive menu. I just love the egg white omelette and zucchini strips! 
A bit pricey but it\'s really good! I suggest that you share it with a friend since the portions are quite big!!
The dinner menu is the same a-la-carte as brunch I guess, not much choices. But the salmon is not bad, and the mocktail with berries was surprisingly taste good. Average $40-50 per head. Love the interior, from colorful wall, home-feel decoration, to the table and chairs.
Wild honey brunch. Ordered Norwegian ($26) and I love NY ($24) Portion seems small but its really filling. The ambience was good. A little over priced though. 
Smoked bacon encasing a perfectly poached egg with a bed of sauteed mushroom and hollandaise sause beneath. Enjoy the all day breakfast menu on a laid back Saturday. #eatwithzac
Poached eggs, smoked salmon, grilled asparagus and avocado on sourdough bread. If you ever want breakfast for lunch or dinner, check this place out. They serve all sorts of international breakfasts from all over the world. The interior decor is very nice but this place is a little pricy for what it is I think
Ordered: Spanish Hash ($24.00), English ($25.00), European ($20.00) &amp; Candied Bacon ($6.00). Spanish Hash &amp; Candied Bacon is really recommended. Spanish Hash is a mix of beef and potato and its super addictive. Every time I dine in at Wild Honey\'s, I would order Spanish Hash without fail. Candied Bacon has a savoury and sweet flavour. Definitely not those common salty bacon we eat out there. A little pricey but the portion is huge and the taste is worth the value. Dine in for a birthday meal or a little treat to yourself! You will not regret it. I\'m loving the food there so much! Will dine in again when the hole in my pocket is sewn. Try it soon if you haven\'t!
Ate at the newly shift place (which is just right next door from their previously place), this new area is more open with more windows to boast natural light into the cafe. Wild honey always aces on their ambience and decor, and set that lazy morning brunch. I had the New York dish, of eggs with caramelised onions and smoked salmon. I can\'t fault the eggs, as it had robust flavours and totally firm, but soft and runny at the same time. I was hoping that they served good bagel, but sadly it isn\'t comparable to what my New Yorker described of a proper bagel, that is hard on the outside but with that chewy inside texture. Unlike the \"bread\" style of a bagel. So my hunt for a good bagel continue. 
So in love with the ambience!!! Rustic wall paperings, comfy couches, lots of natural sunlight, birds-eye view of bustling orchard road, ambience was simply close to perfect. (: Same to say for the food too! Underdog Sweet Morning ($18) still lived up to its name as being one of their sweet specialities; texture of French toast was good, and what really made this meal happen for me was the mango stuffing in the French toast - very very nice and original touch! Norwegian ($26) was a huge enjoyment as well, ingredients were fresh and flavourful. Service was efficient too with their electronic seating system - we were lucky enough to get the best seats in the house! Be prepared for a 5 minute wait though, but the food, the ambience, the experience will be completely worth it. 
$24.00 - the egg, the salmon, and the bagel are just perfect. A complete brunch menu you should try. It is quite crowded there, so you better make a reservation first before you go. 
That\'s the Parisienne: my double stacked French Toast stuffed with leg ham and Gruyere, buttery Hollandaise, not forgetting the duo of Sunny-sides and a generous portion of well-dressed Arugula. \n<br />They\'ve expanded; their cafe could easily seat 60-70 buttocks at any one go and it\'s super spacious. Food\'s way better than I remembered it to be, great service too! \n<br />If you\'ve been disappointed, it\'s actually worth another visit folks üëåüèª
i love the ambiance and the new menu and the waiter (malandi!) i ordered the belgian waffles. they were so yummy! the coconut flakes, mangoes and blueberries were a great combo üòã plus, i will eat anything with coconut as an ingredient \n<br />#alldaybreakfast #food #foodie #foodporn #foodstagram #burpple #sgdesserts
Minimal fuss and not the most photogenic but nonetheless enjoyable! Liked the maple bacon in particular! 
Waffles are light but a little too soft. Mangoes served with coconut flakes! Sweetness is just right. Would be better if the waffles are slightly crispy.
I\'ve always love the good looking brioche toast at Wild honey! This is a soft French brioche toast with mango fruit nestled within! The mango and the berries compote was slightly sour complimenting the rich cream and maple syrup! 
Grilled salmon was soft topped with sweet tasty sauce. However the rosti tasted like potato chips as it was too crispy and abit burnt. Not really worth the price. Would go back for the ambience but not the food. Rating: 3.5/5
Tunisian - Spicy shakshouka with Chorizo, Parisienne - Stuffed french toast with leg ham, cheese, dijon mustard and topped with a fried egg
Atas but cosy ambience. Ordered the English Breakfast to share for 2 so that we have space for desserts! Definately gonna come back again to try the Tunisian breakfast!
Crisp-coated and creamy-centred, the three large pieces of goat cheese are a gorgeous match with the mixed salad of baby spinach, warm bacon pieces, vine tomatoes and toasted pine nuts, all tossed together in a honey mustard dressing. Only Wild Honey\'s own signature toasted brioche batons qualify to accompany such a lovely concoction. Ordinary breads need not apply. 
The ever popular \"Wild Honey\" at Mandarin Gallery has moved to the unit right next door to its original location (which is now occupied by \"Sacha &amp; Sons\", a New York Deli-style eatery by the same owners of \"Wild Honey\"). With high ceilings and plenty more square footage, I have to say this is a case of an old favourite changing for the much better.\n<br />The move also saw tweaks being made to their menu, with the \"Greek Loukoumades\" as one of the new additions.\n<br />So what are these exotic-sounding things? In a nutshell, they are the Greek version of doughnuts. Which sees these freshly-fried glazed balls of dough coated in lavender honey, thyme and a sprinkle of chopped pistachio before they are sent off on their merry way--with a little bowl of Greek yogurt and fig compote--to the customer\'s table.\n<br />Honestly, I liked this more that I\'d thought I would. The warm doughnuts were pretty magical when paired with the cool yogurt and gently sweet fruit.
wild honey never fails:\') tried tunisian this time and damn it was good! though the pita was quite hard. I would prefer the bread provided at Scotts square though. The eggs benedict was flowy and nice with the right mix of salmon and avocado. yummy! and the basket of Brazilian bread was amazing. not a fan/lover of cheese and I actually dislike it but me saying that the Brazilian bread was amazing means a thing hahah. worth the splurge once in a while for a delicious brunch!üòä
If only breakfast is this good everyday... The meat took in the taste and aroma of red wine sauce and was cooked till soft and tender. The onions and shallots added sweetness and fragrance to the sauce too! Grill marks on the ciabatta for appetising presentation and last but not least perfectly poached eggs.
So many breakfast places have sprouted out over the years but wild honey was one of the first and still one of the better breakfast places . Check out their recently expanded branch at the mandarin gallery
My favorite all day breakfast place. Their bread and eggs are really good. 
I am back for my favorite dish at wide honey - Tunisian. Thank it accompany me for many raining days...however the time has changed!!! I love the bread they served. It\'s just nice the softness. Now they changed to this kind of \'pancake\'(ÁÉßÈ§ÖÔºâwhich srsly reminds me of the 20 cents (sgd) Chinese ÁÉßÈ§Ö sells along the street of some China Universities. &gt;..
Went to the newly renovated outlet at mandarin gallery but I would say I\'m pretty disappointed with the food. The ambience and setting is good but it\'s overpriced. The Tunisian all day breakfast (Sizzling Pan of spicy shakshouka studded with chorizo sausage crowned with 2 fried eggs) was wild honey\'s signature dish but it went really wrong. In the past they serve this with their brioche bread, not sure why I was served with 2 pieces of naan instead. The stew was runny, almost watery and diluted. Service was pretty slow and crews weren\'t attentive enough. It\'s only a fancy place to go for it\'s ambience. 
The food here is pretty average for its brunch. Too much butter in each dish making you sick. Overpriced and probably something i can dish out for my own. Not very satisfied though!
My visits to Coffee Nowhere and Wild Honey up on blog [qiuuing.wordpress.com]! Link also in bio.
Had my daily load of sweet stuff with a Canadian (food, not a man üòÅ): pancakes, maple syrup, hibiscus-berry compote and candied bacon!
All day breakfast at wild honey. Worth the price. It\'s fantastic. The juicy sausage crispy thick toast grilled tomato drops of potatoes from heaven and those mushrooms. Mm mm m. Definitely worth the price considering the portion is pretty huge. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Tomato sauced with poached eggs, onions, chipolata and red pepper served with two slices of bread and salad. A lil spicy for the lips but taste sooo good and filling! SG$20
Eggs Benedict served with saut√©ed mushrooms, brioche and ham. SG$20 
English ($25)\n<br />Scramble eggs, bacon, pork sausage, saut√©ed mushrooms, baked beans, breakfast potatoes, grilled tomato, 2 slices of brioche.\n<br />A signature dish that is definitely worth going for over and over again! I liked how their baked beans are not just from cans and it\'s probably the best I have ever tried.
The Parisian is a great choice but keep it to your self this cozy little place fills up fast. Great coffee from common man roasters thou a little pricy.
Now that she\'s back, it\'s back to our eggs Ben, cranberry scone and wild mocha dolce! The standard has dropped however. Smaller portions and the crust of the scone didn\'t quite cut it. #meh  #brunch #wildhoney
Grapefruit, elderflower &amp; honey... Winning combination
New item and I\'m loving it! But not the 1hr 10min wait before that. They were kind enough to serve complimentary homemade vanilla mush mellows. Not to be distracted, did I mention the portobello is awesome! Yes it is, coming from a non-mushroom lover.
See all those vanilla seeds...
Scrambled eggs mixed with caramelizd onions &amp; smoked salmon from Norwegia and toasted bagel with Wild Honey\'s cream cheese. It doesn\'t look much, but it\'s a very, VERY filling breakfast. The bagel was so nice with the cream cheese made by Wild Honey themselves. The scrambled eggs was nice, but the salmon lost abit of their smokiness when cooked. Nevertheless, this dish had me craving for them the moment my stomach digested them! The awesomest breakfast I had. However, do note that this is not cheap. But it\'s definitely worth every single cent. ($25 before taxes)
good combi and top up w the caramel is so sweet to ur heart :D
Very generous portion of a hearty all day breakfast. I would go back again if they decide to take away their service charge, if you get what I mean üòâ
Definitely give this French toasts a try whenever you\'re visiting wild honey! The mangos sandwiched between the toasts balanced out the sweetness making it not too overly sweet. Definitely coming back for more! 
If there\'s a place I want to visit because of a dish there then it must be Tunisia.
The Norwegian breakfast from Wild Honey has been granted as a honorary staple in Valhalla. Honestly. I am slayed. (Of course when you look at the pricing you also get the feel that yes, it\'s definitely imported from another realm) Good for special occasions like dinner after a long, victorious battle (with reality)
Hope I\'m as lucky as @jane_dolphinz, can see some celebrities here. Lol!
At Wild Honey, you\'re spoilt for choice, and their all-day breakfast is bound to put you in the perfect mood for the weekend. The menu is so tempting, each dish promising satisfaction. Go for the Norwegian, an unctuous combination of poached eggs wrapped in smoked salmon topped with hollandaise and salmon roe, sitting on a bed of asparagus. Alternatively, take a trip to Tunisia for some killer baked eggs in a pan, and mop up all that goodness with perfectly toasted slices of brioche.
Tunisian was good, a little watery but still good you can never go wrong with chorizo. Goat cheese salad was Yummy but please, mix the cheese into the salad before eating. Lastly, Spanish hash was good as well if you\'re into a different take in your typical, Eggs, Hash and bacon. 
But the savory bacon just make it heavenly.
Bacon + Jam + Thick Pancake = Surprisly Well. Merry Christmas Everyone!!!
Roasted pulled pork,  ham, emmental cheese and rocket sandiched between freshly toasted ciabatta.
My favorite dessert drink. Rich chocolate, strong coffee. Best paired with their lovely scone!
Score: 6/10
Simply delicious the stir-fried chopped chorizo, corn beef and potatoes.
Scramble eggs, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Baked beans, Mushroom, Pork Sausage &amp; Bacon, Toast
Third time here and the food never disappoints! Parisienne breakfast this time round. Great way to kickstart the weekend :)
I love chocolate drinks. This one, despite being a little too light and not memorable, comes with a huge block of marshmallow. Just got to love such pairings.
This version of an Eggs Benedict is unique and damn, I\'ll wake up early if I get this every morning. I\'m not usually a fan of thick toasts, but hands down to this one. The hollandaise sauce is fantastic. I\'m wide awake!
First time here, service and ambience was splendid but I didn\'t really enjoy my plate of Italian special as it was too salty. @mrpopiah took the English one which tasted better and more worth the bucks. Would recommend this place more for a date not a place to chill w your friends.
The European. Poached eggs, prosciutto, mushrooms with hollandaise sauce. Always thought you make lots of money doing all day breakfast. This cost $19!
House specials for a limited time only--The Italian. Poached eggs, arugula, pan fried prosciutto and mushrooms, on top of ciabatta.
A catch up with my ex level boy! His dish for the night! Looks gooood too:)
Creamy hollandaise and salmon roe on poached eggs and toast with avocado and asparagus! :))) A dish so remarkably unforgettable!
it doesnt look like much, but it was quite filling. eggs benedict with some seriously awesome smoked salmon with asparagus and two piece of lovely brioche.
Eggs Benedict \"European\". Food was not bad. Service was subpar. The cashier was polite &amp; friendly to non-locals but when it comes to the locals, super forced &amp; rude. Ridiculous. Definitely NOT going back. #customerservicefail
My first and favorite eggs Benedict to date! Having had quite a few eggs Benedict\'s since then, the exceptional aspects of this eggs Benny are Wild Honey\'s signature fluffy brioche that mops up all the hollandaise and egg, and the saut√©ed mushrooms that balance the savoury ham and rich hollandaise! One of the more expensive eggs Benny out there at $22 but it\'s reliably scrumptious!
Best breakfast I\'ve ever had! The brioche bread is fluffy and lightly toasted/eggs are thick and delicious/ bacon &amp; sausage both pack lots of flavor/potatoes are soft, hot, and slightly, pleasantly salty/baked beans are also soft, and very tangy. 5 star brekkie! Highly recommended!

Pardon the second picture of the English breakfast üò¨ The #porksausage is a standout for me. And the baked beans are no common canned baked beans but it‚Äôs actually spiced and tastes freshly made. #effortmade
My favourite part of this was the egg whites. Oops! Bit too greasy for my liking

‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />A brownie with vanilla ice cream. Personally, I find it dense but it was chocolaty enough. I do find it a tad oversized for a brownie. Ice cream is too sweet for me. My idea of a brownie is smaller, with top layer cracks here and there, more rustic look. Beneath should be pillowy soft and moist. This felt more like a chocolate cake.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />The saving grace was the nice soothing pot of tea which my friend shared with me. Company is awesome. Brownie not so. I think this place is more suitable for their yummy brunches and all day breakfast.\n<br />‚óæ‚óΩ\n<br />Thank you Olivia for the company and the sweettreat.
Not a fan! Just that bit too dry!
Portions a tad smaller than before, but it\'s a lot better as it\'s now a more manageable amount

glad i didn\'t so i could save some stomach space for this \"European\" of Italian Prosciutto wrapped over perfectly Poached Eggs and a bed of Saut√©ed Mushrooms, covered wonderfully with well-balanced Hollandaise Sauce and sitting on crisply-edged, fluffy Brioche (aka Eggs Benny)
Scrambled eggs, Canadian back bacon, Cumberland pork sausage, saut√©ed mushrooms, dad‚Äôs baked beans, breakfast potatoes, grilled vine tomatoes &amp; signature brioche
This dish was good because the quality of the salmon and hollandaise was good. The asparagus had a good grill on it and the avocado added a nice touch of creaminess. The brioche was also very hearty and delicious. Service however was slightly half hearted. Water was not even served and prices were rather steep

It was really pleasant and nice. Soft and chewy!
Thick frothy milk, a good brew. Bean tasted a tad bitter. Verdict: 3.5/5
An omelette in a skillet, with blobs of chewy buffalo mozzarella and feta topped with grilled zucchini and kale pur√©e. The red sauce was similar to sriracha. I like the fluffy lightness of the omelette and the salty pungent flavour the cheese added to it. This was really tasty heaped onto the crusty sourdough on the side. The veggies were a nice healthy touch though they didn\'t add much in terms of flavour.
Where the breakfast wasn\'t as fantastic as we remembered but the fabulous company more than made up for it! Looking forward to our Bali trip üò¨

Canadian and Norweigan at the back. Simple yet so satisfying because of how well the flavors contrast and complement each other.
Hearty brunch and I like the light and fluffy brioche the most.

üç≥ üçû Wild honey serves a wide range of breakfast sets and there will definitely be one that appeals to you. This is the Spanish Hash- Diced chorizo, corned beef and potatoes topped with 2 poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and grilled ciabatta. üòã

Break fast
Crispy Ciabatta bread with spiced pulled pork + ham + cheese and homemade pickled. Heavenly delicious üòã. The breakfast potato on the side is a bit salty and missing the crispness to it. Overall a good meal. \n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #whatieat #sandwich #artisansandwich #cubansandwich #sgfood #sgfoodb #foodbloggersg #igsg #igsgfoodies #burrple #foodporn #foodgasm #hungrygowhere #openricesg #wildhoneysg

Big big portion of breakfast for the whole day.
Better and satisfied the granola craving üòä
Elevated version of the conventional eggs benedict- Every single component nailed to perfection with generous amount of hollandaise sauce. Price on the steeper side but was totally worth it.
This was much denser and chewier than the usual #waffles. It may be a \"true-er\" Belgian #waffle but... I guess I like mine crispy! Didn\'t quite enjoy the #custard too and found it too #sweet and overpowering. Sowwie #WildHoney #throwback #tbt
They even stuff mango inside the toast! Amazing.. Lol!!

In love with all the brunchies~
Only my second visit to Wild Honey and this time I ordered the Aussie breakfast. Sirloin beef steak atop roast potatoes and saut√©ed mushrooms. Crowned with a bull\'s eye and a side of ciabatta, spicy tomato chutney and baked beans. Verdict: the beef and mushrooms were average but everything else was really good. Absolutely love the potatoes here and despite not being a fan of baked beans, these were really good. They used broad beans and it was tasty and spicy. #foodporn #instafood  #foodgasm #brunch #burpple
