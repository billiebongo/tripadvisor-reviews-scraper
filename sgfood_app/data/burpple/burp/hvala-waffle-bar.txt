Uji-matcha soft serve ($5.70 with cone) was pleasantly bittersweet and smooth, topped with messy Nutella that gives a bit of sweetness (you can opt for the biscuit if nutella\'s not your thing BUT WHY). The cone was light and delicate, but sadly wasn\'t fragrant.
I do love matcha and I do love ice cream but this bitterness was unexpected when I wanted some dessert. This matcha Bella ($7.80) is creamy thick soft serve that\'s matcha bitter. They recommend the puffle (+ $3) if you\'re sharing. The nana slice 🍌 with torched granules of brown sugar and the almond choc sticks were a brief relief. From middle down is where it got weird with a layer of pasty azuki. Peanut hazelnut spread does not fuse well with this one. It\'s better with the vanilla soft serve, which though a tad sweeter, was very bland. As you hit the bottom, the sweetness of bits of mushy caramelized nanas mutes some of the bitter. Maybe it\'s just not my thing 🤷🏻‍♀️
💚💚💚💚\n<br />•\n<br />•\n<br />Matcha soba ($5.20)\n<br />Topped with toasted buckwheat puff, wasabi furikake &amp; crispy seaweed. The matcha softserve is very smooth and creamy with a very distinct rich matcha flavour and lingering bitterness taste on the palate that i like. Totally  my kind of softserve as it is not too sweet. Definitely an interesting twist with a sweet &amp; savory balance. \n<br />#burpple
Tried the tsuba parfait with egglets and Nutella drizzle ($10.70) and the Nutella matcha combination was super bomb. Matcha soft serve here is creamy but light which was perfect with the accompaniment of chewy egglets and sweet Nutella! I personally prefer the rich matcha soft serve flavour from matchaya tho!
\"How is it that I took so long to try this gem of a creation?!\", screamed the voice inside my head when I first tasted this soft serve-meets-eggette treat. Inspired by Oddies Foodies, no doubt, but delicious all the same with its own innovative spin.
Finally tried this dessert that was pretty much in trend a while ago! Tastes not too bad but it was pretty messy to eat it 😅 Worth a try but it really is too much to just have the whole thing to yourself
Creamy. Smooth.\n<br />Unique flavour with a light matcha taste while the soba was less distinct. I was expecting to taste the real soba noodles, but it wasn\'t that strong 😹. So many green food in Singapore, are you turning green yet? 💚\n<br />🔅\n<br />Sitting in the train\n<br />Racking my brain\n<br />My brain juice drained\n<br />My words strained\n<br />My heart in pain\n<br />My world slain\n<br />Once again\n<br />It\'s a chain\n<br />You reign\n<br />My life you stain\n<br />Never meeting again\n<br />I have more to gain.\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋 Havla Waffle Bar\n<br />🍴313 Orchard Road, #B3-50, Singapore 238895\n<br />⏲ Daily 11:30AM-10PM
Decided to be a little more adventurous in my choice of soft serve.. It\'s actually an interesting combination of sweet and savoury though it leans more towards the savoury side as the toppings overpower the matcha soft serve. This is one of the least sweet soft serve that I\'ve ever eaten and I felt that the matcha taste could be stronger.. #burpple
Actually any day would work, cause it\'s ice cream. \n<br />Finally tried Hvala (yes I\'m embarrassingly late in hopping onto this bandwagon), but it\'s definitely worth it! The yoji($5.90) comes with a nice contrast of yuzu jelly and sour berries, topped with vanilla ice cream! The best part is the surprise core in the center as they mixed granola, yuzu jelly &amp; sour berries in the middle, giving you a nice mix of all flavors in one scoop!
Other condiments that accompanied the soft serve ice cream includes crunchy granola, berries compote, chocolate-dipped wafer and a touch of Himalayan pink salt.\n<br />•\n<br />Hvala Waffle Bar\n<br />Address: 313, Orchard Road, 313 Somerset, Unit B3-50, Singapore 238895
Having the Tsubu ($7.80), you can customise it further by choosing an add-on such as the massive Puffle for an additional $3 (but I decided against it so as to save tummy space 😂). Surprisingly balanced in flavours, the parfait featured a pretty swirl of matcha with toasted buckwheat puffs, gula melaka sago, grilled dango and senbei. Creamy, smooth and bittersweet; their soft serve definitely hits the spot though some would prefer a more intense earthy note of Matcha. Loving the textures and savoury elements, the crispy toasted puffs sprinkled atop and salty cracker added another dimension (taste of nuttiness?) to the treat. The grilled dango too, was a nice touch. Providing a contrast in temperature, the lightly grilled skewer had a sweet caramelisation and soft-chewy bite. Yas~
One of the parfait is Tsubu, that has an assortment of toasted buckwheat puffs, gula melaka sago, grilled dango and a senbei
Tsubu Parfait $7.80 from @hvalawafflebar, matcha softserve topped with toasted buckwheat puffs, gula Melaka sago, grilled dango and senbei. I\'d suggest adding $3 more to get that addictive puffle to level up your Parfait.\n<br />_\n<br />The matcha deliver a smooth taste with a slight bitterness and the buckwheat puffs gave an additional crunch. On the other hand, the gula Melaka sago lost it\'s sweetness to the intense matcha soft serve. 🍵🍦Also tried the matcha soba flavoured soft serve, interestingly good.
Didn\'t know what to expect so was tickled by the slight tangy-ness. As usual, love the cone but it can get soggy fast. In my favorite color too 😜
Loving their ever-changing flavours, I got my hands on Hvala Waffle Bar’s latest limited-time-only soft serve. Made with organic elderflower, homegrown blue pea flower tea and Thai coconut water, this dairy free swirl is tangy, refreshing and light.
Decided to order a soft serve and egglet with 2 toppings for $7.90!!!!!! The soft serve was a much lighter and less creamy version of macdonals\' vanilla cone, topped with caramelised banana, crushed peanuts and a salted caramel sauce. As if that does not sound good enough, make that even better by topping the entire soft serve with a chocolate drippled peanut encrusted freshly made egglet 👅👅👅 truly a dessert fit for a king (or in this case, queens????) it was rather large so it is good for sharing and it left us truly satisfied :-) would give it an 8/10!!!! Except service is a little slow hehe 
The vanilla soft serve is smooth and the egglet is slightly crispy and soft on the inside. Cost $7.90, comes with 2 choices of topping and sauce.
Rose Blossom soft serve $5.20 // The flavour and watermelon bits reminds me of watermelon strawberry cake. 😍 The soft serve is smooth and refreshing, topped on a crisp red velvet cone and edible floral. 🌸🍦
A beautiful creation ,and The flower in the ice cream can eat !if the soft-serve less sweet could be even better :)
Located at 313 Somerset basement, this place has one of the best selection of icecreams and waffles in all of Singapore. Never knew icecream can look so beautiful and tastes amazing at the same time. Highly recommended place. 
{Rose Blossom Soft Serve} $5.20 🌹\n<br />•\n<br />Wow this was legit AMAZING!! (Then again, I love rose flavored stuff) They are quite generous with the serving size and the watermelon added at the bottom of the cone provided an interesting and refreshing end 😉 •\n<br />📍313, Somerset
.\n<br />Attractive edible flowers on soft serve that brightens all Monday blues.\n<br />.\n<br />While the rose flavour was kind of subtle, overall taste was pretty refreshing with its floral note and honey fragrance.
Had the privilege of sampling a prototype of Hvala\'s new creation – a pristine swirl of rose-infused vanilla bean ice cream wearing lashings of honey and edible blooms. If you think this is pretty, just wait until you see the actual product when it\'s launched TOMORROW with its special red velvet cone!!!!!! 😍😍😍 .
So the geniuses at @hvalawafflebar have turned my favourite chocolate bar into the inspiration for their new limited edition soft serve – AND I LOVE IT.
I think I prefer the original egglet... but hey, this isn\'t bad. It comes with the zesty orange flavor that sneaks into your mouth with every bite. It\'s not that strong though, since it pretty much gets overpowered by the chocolate. I don\'t quite like the mango key lime taste (does it actually taste like mango key lime tho?), which I found it to be rather weird but couldn\'t pinpoint exactly what is wrong. This comes in a set which means you can\'t choose to have the vanilla flavor to go with this orh lulu egglet. So I suppose I\'ll just go with the good old original egglet with the vanilla flavor soft serve then.
In dire need of a cold treat especially with the scorching hear these days. Trying the Puffle for the first time especially since egglets are fast becoming a trend of the late, I have opted my Puffle to come with maple syrup (you could choose between maple syrup and chocolate sauce). The egglets come with a whiff of buttermilk fragrance, lifted by the soft sweetness from the maple syrup though on the downside, I was warned that the toppings wouldn\'t stick on the Puffle if I opted for maple syrup. For the vanilla soft-serve, there is a choice between a few other sauces which I opted for Speculoos (I blame llaollao for my instantaneous reaction to cookie butter), and it comes with two other toppings which I have opted for the mini marshmallows and almonds. These were no doubt decent, but perhaps going for something else instead of mini marshmallows might have been a better decision, especially given how the mini marshmallows felt a little stale being slightly dry, stiff and a wee bit wrinkly. With so many cold treats around the $7 range in 313Somerset, I guess it just boils down to personal preference be it Hvala, llaollao or ISEEISEE that one would choose.
The glorious sweet tooth combination of egglets &amp; soft serve with a whole load of marshmallow &amp; fruit loops topped with chocolate &amp; speculoos sauce; all your sweet tooth fantasies to life for $7.90!
So... this egglet omg, it\'s so damn good, idek. I was sad to hear that the black sesame sauce was out of stock (what\'s with me and out of stock omg) and the service staff could sense my disappointment like I\'M OBVIOUS LIKE THIS. But seriously, this is really good. I chose the... ummm frutti loops aesthetic purpose. And strawberries because I need fruits and I heard the soft serve could get too sweet so it could help with neutralizing the sweetness with the evident sourness. Oh, I also asked about that orh lu lu egglet that I saw on Instagram and they said it\'d be released NEXT WEEK. GO GRAB IT WHEN IT\'S OUT.
Although it requires a bit of hassle to eat the whole cup of dessert, it\'s definitely worth the try if you\'re anywhere in 313 Somerset! For a price of $7.90, it\'d be a little bit off the budget for most people but just try it for once👍!
Even though the egg waffle is not as crispy or hollow as the real deal, the combination of all the ingredients goes pretty well together. Price is at $7.90. Oh, the ice cream taste just like the ones from McDonald\'s. 
Super good and crispy when you eat it immediately!!! Froot loops are delicious and the softserve adds another flavor on top of the waffles !!!
I needed something sweet and colourful to chase away this grey afternoon. Look at the messy but generous amount of chocolate sauce drenched over my fluffy puffles! The colourful fruit loops were so tightly sticked on, as if they had defied gravity. I find the soft serve smooth and light (idk what\'s so \"premium\" about it) which became aromatic and slightly buttery as I requested biscuit crumbs as one of the toppings. So sinful but so satisfying! 😈 *burps*
Finally get to taste this goodness💜 The egglet is not too crispy but a little chewy just like waffle and has a strong vanilla taste which really goes well with the soft serve &amp; toppings added. #hvalawafflebar #hvalawaffle #burpple
Hvala\'s vanilla specks soft serve with speculoos sauce, blueberries and bubble waffle topped with chocolate and mini marshmallows.
What I enjoy about hvala all the times because I enjoy customise flavour according mood of the day. 🙃 *chuckles* 
Not the easiest to eat but definitely worth the \"hassle\". Generous with toppings as well. 
Definitely cnt beat the ones in HK but was decently crispy enuf. A little hard n messy to eat too tho😅
Though I\'d have preferred (&amp; also expected) a more pleasant chewy texture like the original ones from the streets in HK, the salted caramel &amp; chocolate sauce makes up for it. It’s also quite filling on its own – great for sharing!\n<br />:\n<br />Rating: 3.8/5\n<br />Worth your calories? It\'s the healthier choice! (I think) 😂\n<br />📷 Credits: @blancheeze
SO MANY people looking at me as I was taking photos of this. \n<br />One went \"Isn\'t that @danielfooddiary ?\" Yah lor, some more I wear very \'lock\' today.
Egglets topped with chocolate sauce, crushed nuts and fruit loops (you can choose your two toppings which also included fresh fruits such as kiwi, mango, blueberries etc) with soft serve (vanilla) drizzled with your choice of sauce, mine was salted caramel (they also have black sesame, cookie butter etc). Photogenic but no wow factor, I would rather have better than your BF churros next door or walk a couple more steps to llaollao.  That being said, it doesn\'t taste bad -- I finished everything 😁😁
Looks like the HK egglet waffles right? (Actually more specifically the Oddies Foodies that I had in HK.)\n<br />.\n<br />This huge cup here consists of the light and airy waffles, premium vanilla soft serve ice cream, 2 toppings of your choice and a sauce to go with the ice cream and waffle itself. Would have preferred the waffle to be a bit more crispy but overall a joy to eat! 😋

$7.90. puffle+2 toppings+premium soft serve. As the title suggests, its so so for me. It can get a little messy eating the puffle as you either have to use your hand or bite off with ur mouth; in both case, the sauce gets on you. Also, I got sick after the first few bites. The puffle has this unique taste (not sure if its cinnamon or caramel or other stuffs) which its not to my liking. 
Loved the waffles and sesame sauce. Asked the person-in-charge to recommend me what sauce was better on the softserve, and I did not regret it, love the smell of roasted sesame 😍. The waffle unlike the HK egglet, as I think their batter is waffle batter (lesser eggs??); anyway highly recommended and best if shared (you\'ve been warned 😏)
Visually pleasing, but would be better if the \'Puffle\' was crispier - the one I had, while airy, was slightly soft. Oh, the fruit loops looked nice, but were too artificially sweet for my liking.
Amazing soft serve ice-cream!
Love their crispy puffles (egglets) and speculoos sauce 😍😍 and its just $7.90
Black sesame sauce recommended.\n<br />.\n<br />What I like about this is that the eggette is actually waffles in eggette form. Hence it is towards the light and crispy type which i can finish on my own.\n<br />.\n<br />Toppings are fully customizable so hurray as we can now build our own version of #oddies!
They tweaked slightly the batter of their waffles and used it for the crispy egglets. The soft and fluffy with crispy edges egglet is freshly made upon order and carefully placed together with their signature vanilla bean soft serve, with 2 toppings of your choice. Please have it with their new black sesame sauce and it is WOW! Totally love the combination!
Black sesame sauce with ice cream is always a matchmake in heaven for me. I\'m also pretty impressed with the made-from-scratch egglet (鸡蛋仔) that goes along with it too!
Let\'s sprint toward the end and have a blast for 2015. But before that, a sweet treat or two would be great! \n<br />In frame is the cake in the jar from @hvalawafflebar. This is really good and the serving is generous too. Really hope that this item will be on the menu in the future. 😋😋😋
But I\'m glad that @hvalawafflebar has got this rendition here in Singapore! NOW I CAN JOIN IN TO SAY CHEY I ALSO GOT EAT EGGLETTE WAFFLE WITH SOFT SERVE. SOMEMORE WITH BLACK SESAME SAUCE. How special!
Hvala\'s edition goes at $7.90 for 2 toppings of your choice. Other interesting topping is the Pandan Coconut panna cotta.
What a treat! Put your hands together for Puffle, Hvala Waffle Bar limited edition creation which I was so excited about (I ran down to try immediately after seeing it on my feed) and still am egg-cited. Crispy egglets and vanilla bean soft-serve ice cream are made for each other, especially with a more than healthy dose of chocolate sauce to top it off. With 5 sauces (chocolate, speculoos cookie butter, salted caramel, maple and the new black sesame) to go over your ice cream and 2 topping to choose from, I had the maple sauce soft-serve with caramelised bananas and strawberries. Enough said, please just take my money!
So blissful 真的很幸福! [Puffle with soft serve S$7.90] it\'s vanilla bean soft serve with 2 toppings, additional toppings at S$1 each. We had muesli, pandan coconut pana cotta and digestive biscuits as toppings, soft serve drizzled with black sesame sauce and egglet drizzled with chocolate sauce. 😱😍 Not a fan of black sesame but I love this combi!
Just when I thought @hvalawafflebar couldn\'t do anything more perfect than their signature waffle bars, they go and launch what they call a Puffle – puffy waffle. It looks like a Hong Kong-style eggette, but it isn\'t. The batter is a slightly tweaked rendition of their original waffle\'s, but it\'s just as good; a web of plump pockets of soft, fluffy dough with crimped, crisp edges.
It\'s waffles and ice cream in a cup!!\n<br />.\n<br />Hoho glad to finally try this and it was good! Waffles were hot and crispy, a nice contrast to the smooth vanilla soft serve. My two toppings were muesli and digestive biscuit crumbs plus my favourite Speculoos cookie sauce! 😋
Hehe! Just done with my very first run ever, can some one get me ice and ice cream? HAHA!
Any excuse for good soft serve 😝
The waffle tastes so well with the ingredients mixed &amp; matched. \n<br />Therefore, if you\'re at town, do remember to try this gourmet waffle sticks out in various exciting flavors at affordable prices! It\'s definitely worth the try👍#hvalawafflebar #hvalawaffle #burpple
Now you can satisfy either of your craving at Hvala Waffle Bar. You can choose to have your dessert in a cup with either waffles or cake (available from $5.90), add some topping, maybe even their vanilla soft serve and voilà you\'ll have your own customised dessert~
Am I awesome? Yes.\n<br />.\n<br />Do I deserve some moist and yummy red velvet cake in a cup from @hvalawafflebar?
Trying out the Red Velvet Cake + 2 Toppings (blueberries &amp; Fruit Loops) + Premium Softserve + Maple Syrup ($7.90) \n<br />Wanted to try out this as I really loved the softserve the last time. However, despite the fresh innovative additionals, I felt that the softserve wasn\'t as smooth as it used to, the vanilla bean taste wasn\'t as strong and even slightly sweeter and icier😕
You can chose from two types of cake base 🍰 (red velvet or chocolate truffle) and a variety of fruits, sauces and toppings. \n<br />I had mine with chocolate truffle, caramelised bananas 🍌, Koko Krunch, mini marshmallows and cookie 🍪 butter sauce. Really good, but I wouldn\'t recommend keeping it too long because fresh fruits are used and the cereal will turn soggy. \n<br />Thanks to the sweet couple Benmin and Lynette for this jar and the handwritten card. 😘
All set to head to the airport, but before I leave, of course I had to finish the jar cake that I had customised at @hvalawafflebar. They\'ll be launching this \"service\" probably in December, so you can consider getting these as festive gifts for your friends!
Hvala has came up with their own creation of placing their chocolate truffle or red velvet cake in a cup, topped with your very own fillings and if you wish, their damn good soft serve! Sounds damn enticing right? I know.
It\'s not just waffles that @hvalawafflebar is dishing out these days – now, they\'ve got cakes as well! Following the same build-your-own cup concept that they\'ve converted the serving format of their signatures waffles to, we can now pick between Red Velvet or Chocolate Truffle Cake crumbs to be layered with as many toppings as we want; these include fresh fruits, cereals, sauces, nuts and of course, a swirl of Premium Soft Serve if desired.
Red velvet cake crumbles with caramelized bananas, blueberries, vanilla soft serve and speculoos cookie butter sauce 🍦 Caramelized bananas were a tad bitter but I love the cookie butter sauce! If only they gave more :P Would love to try their Chocolate Truffle next 😊
\'Let Them Eat Cake\' series, featuring hot favourites like red velvet and chocolate truffle. I love their red velvet one! And their soft serve is still one of the best!
.\n<br />Comes in 2 flavours, this is the red velvet cake, layered with fruits, muesli, yuzu jelly and topped with a vanilla soft serve with SPECULOOS COOKIE SAUCE!! Omg! So good!\n<br />.\n<br />@post_eatz and I love it so much that we went back to get the other flavor, chocolate truffle too!😋👍🏻 #hvalawafflebar
Premium cake + 2 toppings + soft serve ($7.90) - you can select either red velvet or chocolate truffle cake.\n<br />Toppings include whipped cream or cream cheese frosting, fruit loops, nuts etc. Red velvet is a MUST-GO with cream cheese, so the choice is obvious. \n<br />You can also select from the assorted sauces to go with the soft serve and they homemade my favourite speculoos sauce! It is my first time seeing bits of red velvet cake being served as a dessert cup, as I usually have it as 1 full piece. \n<br />The dainty red velvet cake was moist and dense, and surprisingly complements well with the soft serve! In fact, it seems more like a topping to me when u mixed with the swirls of soft serve 😂\n<br />Warning - too jelak towards the middle with all the frosting and cake, so will be better if u share between 2-3 😖
Cubes of crumbly, moist red velvet cake with fresh fruits and swirls of cream cheese, topped with vanilla soft serve drizzled with salted caramel sauce. \n<br />There\'s also chocolate truffle cake if you don\'t like red velvet. Customize your own deconstructed cake with a variety of frostings, toppings &amp; sauces. \n<br />Who says you can\'t have your cake (+ soft serve) and eat it?
Have been missing this since the first time I had it. [Vanilla Soft Serve with Salted Caramel drizzle S$3]
You can see bits of the vanilla beans as you scoop up the rich soft serve. Though neither this nor the waffles are no longer available on Sugar app, they sure make a great snack that one will keep going back for.
A deadly combination of apple and cinnamon is one of the best food inventions ever 😋 (plus waffles too!)
Good blend of cream &amp; dark chocolate.  Perfect place for a quick dessert! Can\'t wait to try out all their flavours 😍 Check out the promotion on the 313 Tring app which gives awesome discounts on their S\'mores Waffle 😋
Introducing Waffles on a stick. Crispy waffles with chocolate fondue, torched marshmallows and graham crackers
Sadly they do not make this flavor anymore!
At only $3.8, this treat is delectable yet affordable. With chocolate and marshmallows on a crispy waffle, all daintily blowtorched, what more could you ask for? A addition of $2.5 will provide you with soft-serve, topped with either salted caramel or maple, it\'s your choice. I would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu. 
Got the limited off-the-menu PB &amp; J Hvala Waffle last Saturday and was pleasantly surprised as the flavours worked really well; from the fluffy cream to the sweet jelly and crunchy peanuts. The peanut butter and gula melaka whipped cream was the highlight, it was light but rich and not too sweet! Do catch it while it last~
you can even observe how they torched the caramlised layer on the apples while you are waiting!\n<br />the waffle was cut into bite-sized so it was really convenient for on-the-go concept. love the soft and fluffy waffle oozing with custard-alike filling. layered with apple slices and caramlised sugar, it felt as though u had creme brûlée in a different way. \n<br />oh and the waffles are prepared on the spot! be sure not to spend too much time taking pictures, because the staff will \'nag\' you to eat on the spot because it is served piping hot 😂\n<br />on a side note, met a staff from @sugar_singapore and he shared that they will be walking from Orchard towards SMU from 4pm tomorrow (22 July). be sure to catch them for great goodies!
Another attempt on their waffle sticks but I recall that their waffles were a bit more plush and fluffier than today\'s standard; perhaps a one-off? Otherwise, this flavour would probably work better for those who love chocolate for the waffle stick was doused with a chocolate sauce above before the hazelnut crumbles and marshmallows were sprinkled and torch-blown on the top. Still good value for a convenient to-go snack though given its price.
A combination of caramalized banana, pastry cream topped with chocolate syrup and peanuts. Decent, nothing out of the world.
Looks nicer in pictures I saw on the Burpple Feed than in real life. It was surprsingly small when I received my waffle stick. I like that the batter is thick and had a full texture to it vs. airy and hollow waffles. The chocolate sauce gave the main burst of flavour with the marshmallows simply adding another texture to it and the crumbled digestives was a bit non-existent. Still, a reasonably priced dessert. Although, I would much prefer heading over and queueing for a Sanum.
Finally trying their waffles and I love that these aren\'t your typical square or round Belgian waffle. These long waffles are cut into 5 small pieces and you use a little fork to eat the waffle! It\'s fuss free and great to eat on the run! It was fun watching the staff scorch the sugar on the apple slices.. For $3.50! I cannot wait to try all their waffles! :)
You get to watch the staff use a blow torch to cook the cinnamon on the apple slices and the waffles were crispy!! For $3.50, you get 6 bite sized waffle pieces that are pre cut for you. So all you need is a toothpick, for easy eating and maximum pleasure! :D
Unlike like ur usual crunchy square cubes, hvala serves waffles on sticks! Kudos for creativity though it was rather lacking taste-wise ☹ didn\'t have the crunch that is characteristic of waffles!!!! The soft serve, however, was perfectly milky and smooth, great for the sweltering Singapore heat.  
back here again but their creme brûlée waffle is still out of stock :( tried their bella banana waffle ($3.80) which comes with fresh caramelized banana with pantry cream, chocolate syrup and peanuts. i wonder when i can get to try their creme brûlée waffle 😐
if you are tired of those typical waffles served on plates, hvala waffle bar offers a whole new concept to their unconventional waffles. waffles are cut into bite size. wanted to try their creme brûlée waffle but was out of stock. their tiramisu waffle ($3.80) was creamy and chocolatey, will definitely come back for other flavours next time
Let\'s hope that some sweets before the end of the weekends will make the following week a lot sweeter. Finally tried Hvala Waffle Bar and had their Apple Cinnamon ($3.50) which has freshly cut and caramelized apple slices, and pastry cream on top of a waffle stick. Salted caramel sauce and cinnamon powder were added for the finishing touch. While many craved their waffles, I actually love their soft serve too. What\'s more, any order of their waffle and you can get a cup of soft serve at a discounted price!
Lightly crisp around the edges, soft and pillowy in the middle. Fluffy orange cream, crunchy caramelised sugar. Love.
Topped with chocolate, graham crackers and cutesy marshmallows which was flame-torched. Waffles were crispy on the sides and soft inside (but not the icky undercooked kind of soft). Decent place if you have waffles craving I guess, and it\'s $3.80. The soft serve was pretty smooth, and you can see little black spots from the vanilla beans (my favourite sight haha). The salted caramel sauce strangely didn\'t taste like it. Asked if I\'d like soft serve so I did and expected it to be together with the waffles but nope. Maybe they should offer that option.
It involves different layers, a base of waffles topped with piped pastry cream and freshly caramelised apples that was cut and done right before your eyes with a blow torch and arranged in an overlapping manner.Ending with a drizzle of salted caramel and a sprinkle of cinnamon! Eaten with a toothpick easily as the waffles are conveniently cut into bite size!
New found favourite waffle recently at 313 Somerset always wanted to try it out and finally today is the dayyyyyyy. I love how the waffle tasted soft inside and crisp on the outside. Worth going back again for more. Overall 7.5/10 portion reasonable amount. 
Apple Cinnamon Waffle ($3.50)\n<br />Thinly sliced Apple, sprinkled with sugar before been glazed. Crunchy, sweet, creamy.
Nice and smooth soft serve with vanilla beans on a hot hot day. Will try their waffle soon. 
Finally got to try this after seeing all the photos flooding my burpple feed. I must say I was disappointed though. The exterior wasn\'t crisp enough and the inside was on the verge btw uncookness and cookness. It probably would have been better if it was in the grill for 30 secs more.
Most stressful day I\'ve had in awhile 😪 Can someone please deliver my favourite Hvala waffles to me, please?
A new concept of waffle is being made here at Hvala Waffle Bar, where waffles come in long sizes that are cut into pieces or on a stick! The Tiramisu and Strawberry Balsamico ($3.80 each) are 2 of the 8 flavoured waffles that they have! The Tiramisu tasted creamy with a slight coffee taste due to the tiramisu cream used and is chocolatey! The Strawberry Balsamico on the other hand, is creamy and sour at the same time because balsamic vinegar is added on top of the cream!
Sweet and simple – chocolate fondue, lightly torched baby marshmallows, and graham cracker crumble on an impeccably done waffle.
Getting sick of the typical waffles? Hvala waffle bar is your choice to something unconventional! Apple Cinnamon with slices of crunchy sweet apples and cinnamon powder topped above a cream based waffle bar. Little crispy on the outside and a little fluffy on the inside. &amp; the best of all, it\'s cut to bite size! Anytime, anywhere
Loving foodie friends who are crazy enough to go \"hello! Can we have 1 of each?\" [Apple Cinnamon S$3.50] - fresh apples with pastry cream, salted caramel and and cinnamon powder on a waffle stick.
Here\'s one of my top picks at @hvalawafflebar – the Bella Banana. It\'s a classic can\'t-go-wrong combination of sliced bananas, semi-sweet chocolate sauce and chopped nuts cushioned with velvety pastry cream on that signature bolster of crispy yet fluffy Hvala waffle.
Back at Hvala and brought friends to try the waffle bar at Somerset. Will be checking out Dinata, a new Portuguese takeout bakery just a few steps away.
Hvala Waffle Bar (Hvala means \"thank you\" in Croatian) is a kiosk located at 313@Somerset\'s basement which offers takeaway waffle sticks in a variety of flavours such as Tiramisu, Bella Banana, Creme Brulee and Berries Delight. Go for the Apple Cinnamon Waffle Bar ($3.50) with caramelised crunchy apple slices and a sprinkle of cinnamon powder, or the Smurfy Smores ($3.80) with colourful torched mini marshmallows, chocolate fondue and graham crumbs. Hvala also offers vanilla soft serve if you need something cold to combat a sweltering afternoon!
Back again with a friend who wanted to try them out. Unlike the other waffles on the menu, the Original Hvala Waffle is one that would attract purists who love their waffles undisturbed. Coming only with just maple sauce and sprinkling of chocolate powder, the buttermilk fragrance is strong and the waffle soft and chewy. Even the lady queuing up with us was telling us \"You gotta believe this is so yummy!\" while we were waiting for our waffle to be served.
Despite being known for their waffle sticks the Vanilla Soft Serve here is also surprisingly good! Speckled with vanilla seeds, it is immensely flavourful of Vanilla aroma yet not overly sweet amidst the creaminess, and the accompanying maple drizzle works perfectly to bring out the subtle flavours well. There is an option to have the soft serve to go atop the waffles, but having it separate definitely sounds like a better option to better taste the items on their own.
If you\'re not one for fussy dressings, go straight for the original Hvala waffle in all its golden-brown glory, enhanced only with a simple shower of cocoa powder, icing sugar and maple syrup. Here, you can really taste the bread-like flavour of the waffle itself.
Cookie crumbs and Graham crumbs sprinkled atop whipped cream and a waffle stick. For the ease of eating, the waffle stick is cut up so you can pick it up piece by piece. It is not your crispy waffle, but the batter is really light and fluffy, even to the extent of chewy, and pairs well with the toppings. Surprisingly not as sweet as expected, and you might crave for one more after finishing it.
Not bad. Pictured here is S\'mores and Apple Cinnamon. #burpple #tingzieeats
what happens when 10 foodies gather? an epic show and tell, laughter chats and food of cuz. \n<br />this hvala original waffles was quite a treat. however currently battling with a bout of stomach flu which has been lingering for some time.
Want to have some waffle but unable to finish one on ur own? Or do u get sick eating one big waffle with the same flavor?  If you are one of those above, do try these Waffle Sticks !
#ilovemyfoodiefriends! Waffles ranging from S$3.50 to S$3.80. Add S$1.50 for a vanilla soft serve with any waffles ordered. Thanks @rachelxie for the yummy sweet treats!
This waffle bar at the basement is just a month old. We tried all eight flavours and both soft serves. My favorite is the Apple Cinnamon one. Some of us liked the chocolate as well as banana ones. The soft serve is icy but really addictive!
In need of a light mid-day snack and after-lunch dessert? *Insert* Hvala Waffle Bar a takeway kiosk located at 313 somerset basement! Crisp and surprisingly chewy in the center, the sweet dessert is quite the treat. I ordered the Smurfy S\'mores - a waffle stick/bar topped with colourful torched mini marshmallows and rich chocolate fondue which I think is a good alternative to the good old circular waffles.
We tried Real Vanilla Soft Serve (with Chocolate Fondue &amp; Maple Syrup) + 4 Waffle Sticks.
Not sure whether the attention is on my nails or the waffle, but hey, I totally get it – both look beautiful 🙊. Hehe.
Didn\'t expect to be so blown away by these waffle bars prettified with various homemade sauces, fruits and marshmallows, but I was.
Love this flavour with a spingy waffle base, topped with chocolate fondue and torched marshmallows. (๑´ڡ`๑)
How about waffle served on bars (sticks), sort of a waffle dog, except that there are much more selection from this takeout waffle bar at the basement of 313 @ Somerset.
(2 sec...) Ok, ok, it\'s Waffles on a stick! Bite-sized waffle on the go. Impressed that they actually torched the marshmallows before serving. (Maybe it\'s an age or health thing, I am getting low tolerance on sugar. So this was way too sweet for me, one bite and I felt high.)!
Essentially the evolution of the \"cheap hotdog waffle\" of secondary school/pasar malam days, having adapted to today\'s waffle-obsessed times. The apple slices were torched and thus nicely warm and sweet, in stark contrast to the relatively temperature-challenged sliced waffle pieces they rest on. Humble, but with potential. 3.5/5
First visited  Hvala Waffle Bar when they first opened, way back it got noticed by other foodies. Did not post this till today due to the lack of a geotag on Burpple. I have several other reviews on hold because their geotags are unavailable. HELP.
Soft serve with Salted Caramel sauce from Havala Waffle Bar. Perfect for desserts after dinner. A new dessert place which we stumbled upon! 
Are you one who only listen to one side and make a judgement without listening to the other?\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Just like my softserve twist. One look and  instantly it seems matcha looked more promising. But after tasting the hojicha, I preferred it simply because it had a pronounced nutty and earthy tone. Matcha was just the green tea finish.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Don\'t judge everything/anybody by the way it/he/she looks. A misjudgement can cause negative vibes. It is truly a miserable feeling to be misjudged. Back to my softserve, I still enjoyed my softserve twist because I chose to appreciate the hard work that goes into making it.

💸\n<br />.\n<br />For that kind of money, I’d rather spend it on Matchaya and Tsujiri Honten (pop up every year at Taka) Their Matcha is much more intense and have the full bodied oomph to it. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #hvala #matcha #ceremonialmatcha #softserve #icecream #cone #greentea
This drink ($4.80, iced) had a very acquired taste and it took me a couple of sips before actually appreciating it. It has a roasty, toasty &amp; smokey taste to it but unbelievably refreshing. I tried it with no sugar added. Oishiiiiii ❤
Ps: Not for the faint-hearted haha..... 😝\n<br />#burpple

Yuzu with Latte crema ($5.30). I was finely impressed by the combination. It was like a satisfying dessert. Marrying the citron sweet slightly tartness of yuzu with creamy crema definitely sets off the fireworks! Yuzu really try it 😃

Happiness is hojicha on a charcoal cone.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />\"Hoji\" means roasted and \"cha\" is tea. An earthy and rustic aftertone with a hint of caramel finish. I think hojicha is the new green. Not as sweet as the typical matcha and not too overwhelming. Smooth and creamy. \n<br />The hojicha looks dreamy. ◾◾\n<br />Super like!! #hojicha #greentealovers #dessertlovers #igers #hungrygowhere #burpple #openricesg #8dayseat #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #instafoodsg #instagood #instagrammers #topfoodshots #photooftheday #topfoodshots #eatoutsg #tripadvisor #hvalasg #313somersetsingapore #bloggers #followforfollow

Although I didn\'t like it as much as I thought I would, I loved the dango. 🍡🍡
Bella - ($8.30) \n<br />+ Egglet waffle ($3)\n<br />Vanilla ice cream with bananas, red bean and chocolate fondue sauce. I wouldn\'t recommend this parfait because it tasted too sweet, possibly from the chocolate nutella topping. Worth a try but won\'t be in my usual go-to place for desserts list.
Light and refreshing
Just the way i like it💚💚💚\n<br />#burpple
With generous serving of gula melaka sago, toasted buckwheat puffs. To top it all off, grilled dango and senbei by the side! 😋

Looks beautiful and tastes good
A rose softserve on a red velvet cone drizzled with blossom honey.\n<br />🌹\n<br />Softserve is made onsite. Not very sweet but texture could be atad smoother and creamier. The taste is quite floral. A little drizzling of the honey syrup and garnished with colorful edible flowers gave the softserve an \"autumn\" feel to it. However, I would prefer the cone to be more crisp and crunchy.\n<br />🌹\n<br />Overall, it was a pleasant dessert. This is not the first time I visited this small stall. The owner is always so smiley, friendly and polite which actually makes alot of difference. It keeps the regulars going back.
With vanilla soft serve, popcorn and coco crunch!
Fav dessert in Town!

Puffle + soft serve with Speculoos sauce.

EAT ALL THE PUFFLES!! 🙋🏻 Finally trying out this super crazy looking dessert - Puffles ($7.90) comes with soft serve and 2 toppings. Suitable for the extreme sweet tooth as this was REALLY SWEET. Soft serve topped with speculoos sauce, fruit loops, double chocolate cookie crumbs for that extreme cray cray sweet ending to any meal!
Speculoos Ice Cream • Red Velvet Cake Crumbs • Speculoos Cookie Sauce • Strawberries\n<br />2 Layers of that = Sheer bliss for my tummy!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#hvalawafflebar #313somerset #dessert #icecream #singapore #food #foodstagram #foodies #foodpics #foodporn #foodgasm #foodspotting #instafood #instagood #instagramers #yummy #amazing #iphonesia #lefooding @lefooding #picoftheday #photooftheday #igdaily #sgeats #sgfood #whati8today #iweeklyfood #eatoutsg #burpple

A very big puffle with marshmallows and cookies toppings. It also comes with a soft serve. You can choose either maple syrup or chocolate for the sauce of your waffle and ice cream. Everything in one cup for just $7.90! One of the most worthy desserts i\'ve ever tried.

Darn you make my heart race. Not to mention the black sesame sauce 😍 who loves this too？
Still one of my favs :)\n<br />#hvalawafflebar #chocolatecake #sgfood #foodporn #burpple #softserve
THIS IS WORTH THE HYPE &amp; CALORIES!!! Joined in the eggette 🍦 bandwagon cuz my first Beijiao eggette I tried in HK was plain ol\' boring 🙊 Like I mentioned, 🍦 would be great to spice any waffle up &amp; make it TONNES enjoyable; Hvala delivered what I envisioned 😂 and thanks to @dolefulpalettes for the heads up! 🙆🏼 For $7.90, Hvala offered two choices of fruits/cereal/nuts, sauces with the eggette. I chose 🍓, fruit loops (of course) &amp; maple syrup for my eggette because 🍫 is too mainstream 😌 And for the vanilla 🍦, you gotta go with their Black sesame sauce - SO DARN GOOD esp when it melts &amp; fuses with the ice cream! \n<br />OH, and if you\'re like me thinking: HOW ON 🌏 DO U TACKLE THESE BABIES?! 🤔 \n<br />EASY. Best way to conquer it without toppling or overcrowding:

You get to customise your calories starting from choice of base (cake or waffle) then toppings before your soft serve!
Soft serve was a little icy and vanilla bean taste wasn\'t strong enough.

For the price, u can get the red velvet or chocolate truffle and both are delightful and moist, airy cakes. What\'s more, you can reuse the versatile jar to store foodstuff like cashews etc. More than that, I admire the entrepreneurship of the two younger owners of hvala. They are so nice and earnest about their biz and it\'s heartwarming to see them pursue their food biz dreams with such vigour and vitality. So, if you are nearby 313 be sure to check out these lovely guys and their dessert cups and jars out! :)\n<br />#hvalawafflebar #cakeinajar #chocolatetruffle #redvelvet #sgcafe #foodsg #foodies #foodporn #burpple

I love the puffy waffle with a light crisp on the outside. Drenched in light cream of sweetness and topped with choc flakes, every mouthful was just filled with greatness. 
The affable owners at @hvalawafflebar made my dream come true and created this off-the-menu special. Going by their track record of existing flavours, I knew this one would be good, but it turned out even better than I expected. It\'s AMAZEBALLS.
Finally get to 👀 and eat my Limited Edition Hvala Waffle Bar with Peanut Butter, Jam and Crunchy.

Finally tried Hvala Waffle Bar and had their Apple Cinnamon ($3.50) which has freshly cut and caramelized apple slices, and pastry cream on top of a waffle stick. Salted caramel sauce and cinnamon powder were added for the finishing touch. While many craved their waffles, I actually love their soft serve too. What\'s more, any order of their waffle and you can get a cup of soft serve at a discounted price!\n<br />|\n<br />|\n<br />#foodart #makan #burpple #burppletastemaker #eat #foodporn #sgfoodporn #foodphoto #sgfoodies #foodstagram #foodphotography #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instasg #vscocam #vscofood #sgfood #foodsg #singaporefood #singapore #sgfoodporn #sgig #igsg #openricesg #8dayseat #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #whati8today #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #hvalawafflebar

That crisp-exteriored waffle topped with \"tiramisu cream\" and shaved chocolate 😍. Think this could be better with a bigger hit of mascarpone and coffee liquor (there\'s no alcohol in the cream, which I think is what is needed to give this more oomph). 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n<br />The service rendered by the hunky young staff was top-notch. He recommended us to try the soft-serve with maple syrup and specially gave us a sample portion to try before we commit to the topping. Also, he was super thoughtful and ran out to pass us the forks to eat the waffles with as we left abruptly after collecting our orders. I thought I met an angel!! 😇 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n<br />On a side-note, waffles could\'ve been crispier and the batter fluffier.. Soft-serve\'s texture was more on the icy side (tastes similar to those frozen yoghurt) - would still prefer the Nana\'s Green Tea\'s creamy texture. Overall the taste was still OK and they still have many rooms for improvement. 👍🏻\n<br />⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n<br />//oᑭeᑎiᑎg ᑭᖇoᗰo// 🎉🎉\n<br />For the entire mth of May, you get to enjoy FREE ice-cream with waffles during teatime on weekdays (i.e. 3-6pm). So do add some colour to your dull working life by popping by during teabreak!! 😂😂\n<br />⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n<br />Credits: Thanks @karlnch for the intro, companionship and \"sponsorship\" 😁\n<br />⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n<br />#AldoraEats \n<br />#Burpple \n<br />#POOPKhakis \n<br />#PostingOriginallyOfProfessionalism \n<br />#SgFoodiary \n<br />#TINlicious
This cosy little shop is opened by two of my old friends, a very lovely couple. This is a very good after-meal dessert because it is delicious, just the right size and more importantly, it is affordable! This waffle stick only cost S$3.50!! Also had the Vanilla Softserve. Wow it is one of the best softserves I ever had! Milky, yet not too sweet. Do drop by to try their waffle stick and softserve if you are in the area! :) #hvala #fatliceeats #sgfood #sgcafe #sgcafehopping #sgfoodies #icecreameveryday #eatoutsg #cafehoppingteam #openricesg #8dayseat #setheats #tinlicious #burpple #wafflestick
Topped with pastry cream &amp; yoghurt and 🍓🍓strawberries, mangoes &amp; kiwi. Once you dig in the waffle is ✂✂ sliced piece by piece b4 it is given its crowning glory. Prefer waffle more crisp. It is either to hate it or love it. #waffles #fruits #dessert #foodspotting #burpple #openricesg @8days_eat @hvalawafflebar
