Had the porridge at congee 88 and was nubbad (but to say it was hotel standard like other reviews will be over-exaggerating üòõ) Ugli muffins was really good though! Grab a bunch of friends to get 12 for $11 so you get yummy muffins for less than $1!! :&gt; #exploresingapore #whati8today #onthetable #tslmakan #burpplesg #burpple #toapayoh #congee88 #uglimuffins #stfoodtrending #jiaklocal #sgig #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgeats

It can also be dipped into the chilli sauce here that was slightly spicy, but also tangy.

Chey sua carrot cake (45mins-1.5hrs wait) mentioned in the michelin guide and my favourite hawker food- kway chap!! üòã‚ù§Ô∏è #burpple #singapore #igsg #sgig #photography #photooftheday #exploresg  #instafood #instatravel #foodporn #foodgasm #bbctravel #travel #travelgram #exploresingapore #jiaklocal #onthetable #asian #eatoutsg  #explore #sgfoodie #onthetable #wanderlust #sgbrunch #hawker #brunch #noodles #michelin #chyetowkway  #TastyTasteMakerTour
Nothing beats having a truly local fishball noodles in the market the Singaporean way. \n<br />The stall here made their own fishballs and fish ravioli which were only available upon ordering the noodles (and no top up allowed!). Noodles were well seasoned and chilli not overpowering nor oily. Unlike others, they added shredded chicken and mushroom to the fishball noodles. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #SGhawker #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #fishball
The fish dumplings with chestnut cubes inside were really good too. A great dish for a cooling good Saturday morning. \n<br />From the Lau Sim Shredded Chicken Noodles stall but they were more popular for their dumplings. #burpple  #burpplesg #foodgasm #foodpornsg #sgfood #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgmakandiary #foodpics #foodlover #foodstagram #foodstagram #foodie #instafood_sg #instagramsg #instasg #whati8today #nomnomnom #instafoodsg #eatoutsg #foodforfoodies #NomNomSG  #sgmakandiary #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgigfoodies #instafood_sg #stfoodtrending #hawkerfood #jiaklocal #hawkersg #supportlocalsg
\"fan choy\" from my favorite dim sum hawker
The soup had a clear and refreshing taste that doesn\'t come with any enhancers!
AHHH loving the weekends.
not recommended after a detox üò¨üò¨ but, oh so yummy
on weekends you gotta wait at least 30min for a plate of these gorgeous and on point textured noodles
