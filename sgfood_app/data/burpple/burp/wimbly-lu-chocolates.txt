Finally gave this a try after hearing so much about it. I love how the waffles is done, crispy and fluffy. Had seasalt caramel and cheesecake ice cream with maple syrup. Quite a good combi, the cheesecake was light enough to complement the slightly stronger seasalt. Worth a try!
Intense craving for ice cream &amp; waffles satisfied. \n<br />Ice cream flavour: cheesecake and chocolate truffle
I was expecting a \'filler\' item.. Haha.. It has all the elements to be a good plate of pasta, nice garlicky taste, al Dante noodles, balance of salt and pepper, and spice for added kick..! But like all aglio oilo, it\'s usually more to the oily side.. And this is probably a tad too spicy..otherwise, it\'s a good plate of pasta.! :) 7.9/10👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Waffles and ice cream are the best combination ever. Would prefer a creamier ice cream as this one simply melt too fast! $11.50 for double scoop ice cream waffle
One of the best and reasonably priced dark chocolate butter cakes at heartland area, accompanied with good service and ambience! (: ($6) appreciate this!
Heard so much about this cafe. I would say it\'s a MUST try for their waffle ice cream. Instantly fly after one bite 👼🏻 Definitely go back for more! 
Coffee was a little milked out but decent flavour. Lemon Cheesecake wasn\'t as tart I would have liked it to be, but I round that up to personal preference. But ambience and service +10!
Waffles with double ice cream $11.50 - reasonable price. Waffles was crispy on the outside. It\'s not very thick type of waffles so not that much fluffy-ness inside. I\'m happy with it cos I like crispy waffles. Salted caramel ice cream too salty. Vanilla one was pretty good and goes well with the waffle. 
Vanilla Bean and Wild Honey were my choice of ice cream flavors. The vanilla bean had a deep flavor 👍 while the waffles had a crispy exterior but was fluffy on the inside. 👍 Excellent waffles.\n<br />Earl grey paired really well with white chocolate and had a light and airy but moist texture. 👍 The Nutella pie was also delicious and had 3 different textures. 👍 The blackout cake was moist and deep but became gelat after a few bites. 😓 Lastly, the double chocolate cheesecake and cookie dough cheesecake were pretty average.
Tried their Eton mess and it tastes great. Expected it to taste sweet but it was quite acceptable. The cafe had great ambience relatively romantic in the evening. Highly recommended for couples dinner date~
At $8.50 with a single scoop of ice cream, it\'s really one of the more inexpensive waffles around. If you like your waffles crispy and thin, this is the choice for you.
If you like chunky apples in your pie! A tad too sweet though 
Ice cream standard like drop a bit, not as creamy or rich. Waffles still pretty alright.
I\'ve tried their waffles a few times already, and they\'ve never failed me. Crisp and perfectly browned on the outside, soft, fluffy and moist on the inside. I would suggest enjoy them with Wimbly Lu\'s super intensely rich and dark Chocolate Truffle ice cream, as I always do. The highly recommended Salted Caramel flavour paled in comparison, flailing between salty and sweet without fully hitting either notes.
It sounds so novel, but really tastes very ordinary. The dense chocolate cake was pretty good, boasting an intensely dark flavour and a wonderfully moist texture - quite like a brownie really. The root beer was supposed to be featured in the sauce; unfortunately all I tasted was a little of that carbonated zing, and none of that childhood soda we all like. The vanilla ice cream was also a disappointment, being more icy than fragrant and creamy. I didn\'t regret trying the famed dessert once, but I won\'t have it again.
Molten lava cake with a side of homemade strawberry ice cream and root beer float cake with vanilla bean ice cream. For the molten lava, it melts in yo mouth and its like totally, foodporn when you take your first scoop of it. 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 For the root beer cake, u can barely taste the root beer but i loved the vanilla bean ice cream tho. 👌🏼 go try em out. 
Waffle w double scoop ice cream to end off the night w the foodies 🍴
root beer float cake, waffle with ice cream, house white wine &amp; iced honey lemon 
First visit to (Little) Wimbly Lu and I\'m surprised how good their waffles are! It\'s fairly similar to my fave ones by the folks at Milk &amp; Honey Gelato, boasting the same crusty exterior and eggy insides that so readily absorbs the melting custard. Only thing is, it\'s actually really expensive. An order of waffles is priced at S$4, and only comes with 2 quarters. Top it with a double scoop (S$6.50), it\'s more expensive and almost half the portion I\'d get at M&amp;H.
Literally melted dark chocolate. Isn\'t the typical powdered chocolate drink. It isn\'t sweet at all but very thick. Phlegm and sore throat might result. You have been warned.
Probably one of the few places that have such a cake. It is a chocolate based cake with a root beer after taste. Special but I don\'t fancy it.
Ice cream is the one that is good. The honey cinnamon ice cream flavour is really nice while the chocolate one is just normal dark chocolate flavor? The waffles here are not that bad. Nice but not special. Crispy on the outside however not fluffy on the inside.
Buttermilk dark chocolate cake with dark chocolate frosting
We visited the branch at myVillage cos their main outlet is closed on Mondays. As their name goes LITTLE wimbly lu, their waffle serving is indeed little-er haha. Also, we got to try their new macadamia cake. What a great way to end off Monday night with desserts and the best company✨
I find the cake a tad too dry but the vanilla bean and chocolate coat compensate enough for it. I\'m quite surprised most of the menu actually falls below $10, plus despite being a public holiday it was really easy for us to get seats. #marshmunch #burpple
The winning recipe of this cafe is the affordable desserts that leavesany doing takeaways. This portion is perfect for a single indulgence rather than sharing.
Had always heard about this famous waffles and manages to find time to navigate through the atas houses the other day! As a lover of crispy waffles, this is definitely my definition of a worthwhile trip!
Love their waffles. I ordered a plain one with maple syrup and butter, and it was heavenly 😋
Loving the Eggs Benedict with a hint of special herbs taste from the sourdough toast perhaps! And also one of my favourite dessert, crepes; topped with the super icy vanilla bean ice cream which I really like as it is not the too creamy kind! Chocolate creme brûlée and cranberry juice are not of much highlights. Not to forget their excellent and warm customer service which really make you feel valued. I\'ll definitely return to try out more of their brunch and lunch mains and desserts for sure!
The outer is coated with a thin layer chocolate cream. Inside was pretty moist.
Got tempted by their waffles so decided to order one with the Speculoos Ice-Cream. Still the eggy and buttery batter that is fragrant and crispy; even better than the last time I had it. Speculoos Ice-Cream was a nice balance of sweetness with cookie dough flavours and crumbs to bite on which was delicious!
As what mentioned above, it\'s just old school. But the waffle is really light and fluffy, which I feel what makes it so nice. The place is wulu but the ambience is good. 
Coffee is nice but the lemon meringue is too sweet for mi and my friend liking. Even after removing the meringue, it is still too sweet...it\'s just a shame...
Spectaculoo ice cream and Ferraro ice cream on mini waffles. Not too bad!!!!! 
Good morning, it\'s midweek in a blink!! After resting in bed the whole of Monday, I\'m up and alive and recuperating (hopefully) 🎉 Girly date last evening [MATCHA LATTE S$5] 
The honey cinnamon ice cream was a delightful surprise. It was sweet, rich and creamy. The cinnamon taste was distinct and complemented the honey well with a very subtle hint of spiciness. Well done. Crispy and fluffy waffles sealed the deal for me.
One of the best waffles i have ever tried thus far! The honey cinnamon ice cream was a delightful surprise. It was sweet, rich and creamy. The cinnamon taste was distinct and complemented the honey well with a very subtle hint of spiciness. Well done. Crispy and fluffy waffles sealed the deal for me.
Great waffles.. It\'s crispy and light! But not much choices of ice cream.. 
Instead of the regular waffle, we decided to go for the crepe with ice cream! Crepe is not bad. What impressed me the most was this particular ice cream called: Speculoos! I had never eaten close to this taste.. Speculoos cookie butter ice cream $4.50 for a scoop! So good!!! 😋😋
Gave it a try after hearing good reviews about the place. For a start, I went with the waffles. Nice maple syrup+waffles combo, though I wished I chose another ice-cream flavour, say, vanilla.
One of the MUST TRYS in here!! I\'ve never eaten anything like this elsewhere, for sweet tooth lovers this would definitely score with you! \n<br />The atmosphere of the cafe is 💯 really cozy and comfortable to sit here with a friend to mull over the days or just alone with a good book!
Loved the marshmallows and crackers inside the chocolate ice cream! ($7.50)
My first piece for openrice.com is finally out where I write about the 15 places I love eat at in Joo Chiat. The link is on my instagram profile if yall are interested in reading it ☺️ On an unrelated note, I finally tried the famed waffles at Wimbly Lu and they didn\'t disappoint. Crispy on the outside and light on the inside topped with a decadent (but small) scoop chocolate ice cream
torched meringue top, lemon curd filling, crust.  sells out very fast
Waffles top with homemade cheesecake and salted-caramel ice cream. Sauce ordered is chocolate. It really turn out super yummy. Must give this a try!! 
One of the best waffles I ever had and totally love it!! #burpple
It was very crowded during my visit. Service was okay. Seats were too near each other... food was mediocre....
Dessert was mediocre but the ambience and set up was good. Place was slightly small and packed, but still a good place to chill out with friends!
Half the portion of the waffles from Wimbly Lu, Little Wimbly Lu here serves equally nice waffles! Definitely worth a try! Location wise it\'s more accessible than Wimbly Lu too.
Not really my kind of waffles (more to the plain tasting side) but really crispy and fluffy! 
Their fluffy waffles taste the best with their salted caramel ice cream! 
Finally get to try their waffles, and it is indeed really yummy! Had their chocolate molten cake too which I scrap every last bit of the bowl! It was a lovely evening 😋
Sugar overload! 
One of my fave place to go for waffles. Their yummy waffles paired with salted caramel ice cream (my fave) I could easily finish one full waffle by myself even after a heavy dinner. I would also order their root beer cake whenever I\'m there 👍👍
I can say one of the best waffle in Singapore 👍
Another one of the widely raved about desserts served at Wimbly Lu that is available in their new outlet at myVillage @ Serangoon Gardens. The dense and moist chocolate cake was rich and definitely hit the mark, and was accompanied by a really faint aftertaste of root beer that can only be detected by savouring each bite. The vanilla ice-cream was a bit weak in its flavour though.
Got to try out the pancakes at Little Wimbly Lu after hearing all about those served in their main outlet. The eggy batter was delicious with its crispness on the exterior and fluffiness inside; good enough to have with just maple syrup. No wonder it\'s clearly one of the favourite waffles that locals have been raving about!
Wimbly Lu open their new outlet - Little Wimbly Lu! Having their lemon meringue tart which is only available on weekends in the main brunch :)
I\'m gonna come back here for more of their mains and desserts! Featuring their hot favourite - root beer cake with vanilla ice cream.
A great place for a waffle fix. However, the place is still super crowded on a weekday afternoon during tea time. And tables are just 15cm away from each other which make group conversation awkward 
Your trip to Wimbly Lu is never complete unless you ordered their waffles. The chocolate sauce + salted caramel ice cream + waffles = a match made in heavens!😋
Very very awesome dessert waffles!!!!! Fluffy and crispy on the outside!! 
I don\'t think this place need any recommendations. The waffles and the root beer cake is a must when you\'re there. Tried the carrot cake and flourless chocolate cake as well, not too bad but not my favorite. Hehe 
Waffles was crispy and a bit plain. I personally prefer a more strong tasting waffle. The ice cream wasn\'t creamy enough for me, and I found the flavour rather odd, tasted more like salted horlicks to me. Chocolate sauce was a bit  thin, but it was fine when paired with the ice cream.
You can have your root beer and eat it too! Good flavour but felt the cake was a bit lumpy and stale... Didn\'t have the refreshing zest that the real drink packs! Give it a miss unless you\'re crazy over root beer.
thank you for bringing me here sweetheart! (and... for being my ever-ready hand model heh)
It is definitely absolutely a place to relax and have your dessert ! Molten choc lava cake is fantastic
Served warm, I can\'t get enough of this heavenly dessert! Totally lives up to its reputation and definitely worth the $6.
Hot waffles that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Together with 4 cold soft scoops of ice cream with the flavours of Milo, Rum &amp; Raisin, Cheesecake and Salted Caramel. Ice cream can have more flavours but the waffles are goodie. 
roof beer cake + ice cream was fantastic! that\'s the only thing I would go back to Wimbly Lu for!!!! waffles were okay though 
Words cannot exactly the fluffyness of the waffle and the sweetness of the salted caramel ice cream (: could really do with a larger scoop of ice cream though! Comes across as pricey, $9+
though it was pretty packed during lunch hour, the queue went swiftly and my friend and I were able to get a seat. The waiting time was alright! The Lemon Meringue Pie was simply yet so full of the lemon zest once you take your first bite. I wouldn\'t say the waffles and the fries are the best I\'ve ever tasted, but for the ambience of this cafe with affordable chocolate dessert prices, I\'d come back for the chocolatey food and truffles! 
Crispy waffle served with a scoop of ice cream (salted caramel). The space is rather squeezy as the tables are very near to each other. 
Iced latte for $5.50!! A small cup but very nice for a hot and humid day like this
Finally tried the highly raved waffles. Gotta say it\'s prettyyyy good. Loveeee the Salted Caramel ice cream. Just that they couldve given a larger scoop with more maple syrup HAHA. Although it was crowded, managed to get a seat within 15 mins, thank goodness! Reasonable price, warm cosy ambience, friendly staff, happy tummy! Yay!
Waffle with maple syrup and salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream scoop is too small though! 
The signature root beer cake with vanilla ice-cream which changed my opinion about the root beer. A must try at Wimbly Lu!
My favourite place for waffles! Wimbly Lu best selling icecream would be their vanilla icecream! Must visit. 
Most awesome waffles... crispy on the outside yet fluffly on the inside. Topped with maple syrup and ice cream
A scoop of salted caramel ice cream on top of a waffle with choc sauce. $8.50
Waffle tastes really great and the ambience is just perfect for a laid-back afternoon. Plus the waitress are very friendly and totally helpful. Location wise, you need transportation!
This will be my last sinful indulgence till December! And I\'m happy! (: This molten chocolate cake has a crisp outer crust and a hot molten filling which complements perfectly with the vanilla bean ice cream! \n<br />I took home the Nutella pie and let\'s see if it\'s yummy as well! If you gotta sin, you gotta make the sin worth it!

Root beer cake and lemon meringue pie at #wimblylu! \n<br />Finally visited this place and tried their highly raved root beer cake! It tastes amazing, and the texture of the cake was just right! (: It\'s a Jalan riang, but it\'s quite a walk from nex and also from lorong chuan! But I think it\'s worth the walk for this chocolatey experience!!!

If u like chocolate and u are living at serangoon, this is the place to be !
 The 8 inch waffle is crisp on the outself and fluffy and moist on the inside. Here\'s a photo of plain waffle. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/wimbly-lu/
We thought it was gonna be a soft, moist and rich chocolate cake but was utterly disappointed by its hard, dry and made-from-cakemix taste. :( Perhaps it would have fared better if it was served warmed.
Really could taste the root beer towards the end! Very pleasantly surprised by this cake! :)
The root beer cake with vanilla ice cream is a winner, will definitely satisfy anyone who has a sweet tooth.
It\'s great!! Altot the place wasn\'t spacious but it has the cozy feel.
And the search for the nicest lava cake continues.. @renhaolee \n<br />#foodporn #dessert #wimblylu
One of the best waffles I\'ve tasted. Should have tried more ice cream flavours though cause its really good!
Chocolaty inside and crusty outside topped with marshmallows. Great for kids and those who are young at heart
Brought to visit the cozy boutique cafe by 2 good friends in SG. Nice place for chilling and taste not bad 👍
I don\'t think many people will get to try this.
Lemon Meringue Pie. #yummy but I wish it was a lil more tart. #foodporn
Nice, cosy place for a lazy afternoon. Cakes are nice! Blackout cake is rich and good!
Back after 6mths to try their waffles! Still prefer saltedcaramel\'s tho!
Had my first root beer float cake a year ago. A year later, it didn\'t disappoint! 👍
Crust too thick, lemon curd not smooth, meringue taste \"raw\".. I can taste the raw egg white. Next please. 
Their famous chocolate cake I guess. Forgot the name for it. :/ #chocolate #cake #dessert
The new \"in\" flavor for #desserts? Have been seeing a few Rootbeer Cake recipes floating around the interweb. Trying it for the first time here with vanilla ice cream. Feels more than just a novelty than a keeper, this. Give me Salted Caramel anytime! | #food #instayum #instafood #instaweekend #foodgasm #chocolate
Pretty place!
Here\'s the much-raved about dessert but I thought it was just okay. Expectations?/:
Seafood seems to be exactly like canned seafood so nah.
Had better ones but yupp it was okay though not something I\'d come back for? 
Waffles was alright nothing to shout about but damn I think the salted caramel ice cream was the best I\'ve eaten so far.
Waffles are supposedly the best in town. chocolate lava cake too.
One of the best lava cake ever tried, the sight of the chocolate flowing out of the cake just make one drools.
Ordered this as it was recommended by ladyironchef. It was a pleasant experience to eat at wimbly Lu as their staff were very friendly and they took our orders with their iPod touch. There were clear instructions on the table as in how to pay and how to order, the environment was really good such that the place was filled with people yet not so crowded. The waffle was crispy and the ice cream was heavenly. Definitely going back to try out more flavors and taste their wonderful chocolate. 
A nice quiet place to eat some chocolate! And some pretty nice waffles 
Wimbly Lu Root Beer Cake with Vanilla Ice-cream! 😍 A surprising, unique dessert that had me thinking of the old school fave A&amp;W Root Beer Float! 👍😋
I\'ve waffled before! I\'ll waffle again with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream, maple syrup and butter! 👅💦
Waffles are just awesome bread! Do you agree?! 😋
It\'s all about Chocolates! Period!!! Hot and Cold chocolate! Which one do you like?! 😋
Would you rather a breakfast platter or pasta for lunch?
.\n<br />I thought it pretty much tasted like chocolate cake. 😞

I had waffles with Chocolate and Salted Caramel ice cream ($11.50), as well as a Matcha Latte ($5). The waffles here were really good! They\'re really crispy and fluffy and I loved them :) the ice cream was also pretty rich in flavour. However, the matcha latte didn\'t really taste like matcha at all, the flavour was kind of weak. :( you have to pay a 10% service charge unlike some other places, but I feel like it\'s worth it because the service and waffles here are really great. :) It\'s difficult to get to without a car though. 
Salted caramel &amp; cookie and cream ice cream on top! Thought everything tasted pretty decent, but it wasn\'t amazing!
😍
Yummy and soft pancakes with great syrup and ice cream 😍 The awesome and friendly service there is a major bonus 👍 Rate 11/10 !

The waffle is really great. It is fluffy and crispy on the outer layer with homemade honey with cinnamon ice cream. It is situated at quiet private estate but after entering to the store it seems like another world.  Cosy and good place to chill. Will definitely go back to try more of their food.

Cheesecake and rum&amp;raisin homemade ice cream.
No doubt, their waffles &amp; pancakes are good! 🍨🍯🍴
Gooey enough, hot enough, hard-crusted enough, \'nuff said. There\'s something detrimental to the experience of eating molten chocolate lava cakes out of holders (ramekins) like this though - it lacks the visual pleasure of seeing your chocolate lava oozing out of its crust when you pry it open :(
Hi-Tea @ Wimbly Lu
