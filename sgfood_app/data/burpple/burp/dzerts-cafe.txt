$5.50 creme br√ªl√©e. Not bad! &amp;Not overly sweet.
$6.90. Apple pie with ice cream and salted caramel sauce. Love the fact that there\'s a generous portion of chunky apples. Like it\'s really apple pie, not just some crust with miserable amount of apple. Ice cream is nice and homemade!
Churros set, $6.50. Comes with tea/coffee. New item not exactly on menu yet. Dusted with cinnamon sugar. Tastes okay, just that texture was a lil inconsistent. Some were perfect, some were too hard. Can\'t wait for them to work on it and put it officially on the menu!^^
$5.50, new on the menu! (\"It\'s so new we have yet to name it\") didn\'t like the initial taste but the taste actually grows on you. Best part, there were small pieces of mango in it! Another success I\'d say^^
nth time I\'ve been to this cafe and can safely say that their desserts are good. $5.50, rich cheesecake but not gelat!!!^^ and I could taste the salted caramel which wasn\'t too sweet yay
$7.90 Tiramisu with a twist - Guinness stout!
$7.90 tiramisu with kahlua! I preferred the Guinness one while mum liked this better cos it wasn\'t that strong.
Hehe uncle came over and gave me this jelly üòÑ
YUMYUM and it isn\'t overly sweet!!!^^ They\'re apparently making salted caramel cheesecake tmr if only I could get a slice of that too.
Officially my favourite cafe. Been loving the food I had there so far. Got the bf to buy this back for me and yepp love it! Pretty sure I can finish them in one go but I had to exercise some self control. If only I could eat without getting fat.... 
$2 yummy orange chiffon cake! Soft fluffy and fragrant
$5.50 (?) Tinge of yuzu, rich cheesecake, not sweet. Downed the entire slice within minutes.
Sigh, I\'m back for this again. ‚ò∫ Mummy loves it too!!!
Chocolate sponge chocolate mousse chocolate glaze. Loved it cos it wasn\'t overly sweet and the texture was a good balance too. &amp;yes, I\'m back again. I think uncle remembers me!!^^ 
Back to the same cafe. $8.90: Waffles, cheese, scrambled egg, ham. The bf loved the waffles, didn\'t like the egg (I liked it tho. Was too.. Runny for him?)
Name comes from the combination of 70% &amp; 56% dark chocolate. It\'s alright (how can chocolate tarts ever go wrong) gooey chocolatey goodness, sweetness just right for my liking. Slight sourness of the raspberry goes damn well. I lied when I said i was going on a diet - finished entire tart by myself üò≠
Matcha latte !
Simple and unpretentious just like the shop\'s decor. $7.90 with the vanilla ice cream, $6.90 for just the sauce. Good service with a friendly owner(?) who bothered to ask if I liked the food. Was a tad disappointed when I realized they had the savoury version cos I\'ve yet to have lunch but oh well no regrets!^^
P.S: Latte art not included (yet) &amp; certain Friday nights / weekends only so please drop me a text first üòÇ\n<br />.
Upsized üôåüèª\n<br />.
Three layers of chocolate goodness with every mouthful but what truly captures my attention is the thin layer of golden powder on top of the cake
Dulce de Leche ice cream with salted caramel sauce

Served with Gula Melaka Sauce ‚Ä¢
Yay for jubilee weekend! Got my favourite waffles with earl grey ice cream &amp; another plain waffle for freeeeeee üòç after all the waffles, this is still the one I\'ll come back to from time to time. 
Still my go-to place for waffles in the East. Crispy, fluffy and absolutely fragrant. $9.90 with choice of gelato and sauce (choose from chocolate, maple, salted caramel and Earl grey caramel). $8.90 if vanilla gelato, and there\'s 20% off on Waffles Wednesdays. Chose peanut butter gelato - nutty goodness, smooth and creamy. Only wish I was given more Earl grey caramel sauce! (They actually sell the sauce in a jar.)
Love their Hazel\'s Delight cake, it was so rich in flavor &amp; we topped up with a scoop of Earl Grey Icecream that was good and not too sweet üòä #dzertscafe
Simply nice dessert in a very quiet and cosy corner of Singapore. #delishfoodlovers #foodporn #sgfood #burpple #ilovesharingfood #sgfoodporn #vscocamsg #vscocam  #whatiate

Yummy waffle! Earl grey caramel is great!
Waffle topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce :)
One of the better waffles I\'ve had in my cafe hopping experiences. The inner parts are really fluffy with a crisp exterior and the pricing is reasonable as well. The range of ice cream available was sufficiently wide as well. A must have whenever I visit D\'zerts cafe ^^ the place is also quite quiet in most days at most timings, great for spending a relaxed afternoon especially with free WiFi and plugs available as well!
Student price of just $8!!\n<br />Waffles with vanilla ice-cream and strawberry syrup.
Waffle was avg but too much chocolate syrup given üôä
Spacious and bright cafe that has friendly server and (not so comfy) chair. But a good cafe to chill if you stay around the neighborhood. Wifi and socket plug are available (plus point!!)

\'Seventy fifty-six\' chocolate tart and strawberry infused with raspberry cheesecake, with iced mocha to fulfill my cravings... Thank you Lord! Happy Sunday! üíúüòâüëçüçÆüç©üç∞üç™üéÇ #eatingismyhobby #desserts #sweets #burpple #foodtrip #cakes #indulgence #happytummy #weekend #blessings
Everytime they come up with something new I have to try it. Sent mum on a mission to bring this opera cake back! Joconde. Coffee buttercream. Dark chocolate ganache. Taste was good tho I think the spongey layer was a little dry.
$5.50. Back again! (Because dessert\'s good and no one would bother you when you study. Friendly owners!) the brownie was not sickeningly sweet or overly dense unlike many that I\'ve tried. Texture\'s of good balance cos its not entirely cakey, has a crumbly top?. Paired with light vanilla ice cream. Here\'s one that doesn\'t make you feel that fat after downing the entire plate!
Brought mummy this time round, she loved the waffles too. And the scrambled eggs. Happy lunch!! (Really like sitting there to do my work- simple, quiet, spacious, yummy food and uncle\'s really nice)
Didn\'t expect any latte art so I was surprised to see it albeit not the best. Forgot to order green tea latte, realized a little too late but hey this was quite nice the way I like it. (Oh yes look at the cute test tube of sugar)
#coffee #caffeine #latte i think it\'s pretty neat they serve sugar in laboratory test tubes. Those we used in the science lab lol #oldschool #nostalgia
