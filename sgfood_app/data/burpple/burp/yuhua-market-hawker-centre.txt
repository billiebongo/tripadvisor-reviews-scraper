They are best had with the chilli and sweet sauce!
Waited for about an hour before food is serve.. üåºSambal Stingray is slightly spicy and the meat is tender. Dip it with their chinchalok enhance the taste. 7.5/10\n<br />-------------------------------------------\n<br />ü•Ä Onion Omelette looks slightly oily but it\'s so fragrance and the onion isn\'t too overpowering. 8/10\n<br />-------------------------------------------\n<br />üå∏ Sambal KangKong is sooooo delicious cause it stir fry with garlic and sambal which is not only spicy and flavourful, the texture of the veggie is so crispy. 9.5/10\n<br />-------------------------------------------\n<br />üíê Sambal Sotong, the sotong is fresh but slightly disappointed cause the sotong doesn\'t absorb the sambal well enough. 6.5/10 -------------------------------------------\n<br />Overall: I will still be back cause it\'s good and it\'s quite cheap too. \n<br />#instafood #insta_food #food #sgfood #sgfoods #foods #yummy #hungry #foodism #foodgram #foodgasm #foodfie #foodspam #foodporn #sgfoodporn #sgfoodstagram #foodstagram #foodspotting #sgfoodspotting #foodshare #sgfoodshare #foodpics \n<br />#sgfoodpics #foodie #foodlover #8dayseat #burpple #dinner #zichar #bbq

It was not too dry, while being slightly spicy and flavourful. The amount of fishcakes and prawns were also plenty for the pricing as well!
The soup was flavorful and comes with the standard ban mian, like vegetables, minced meat, anchovies, eggs, fried shallots and also crabsticks as well!
However, the sweet and sour fish was cooked till overly soft, while the brinjal and cabbage were just average tasting.
