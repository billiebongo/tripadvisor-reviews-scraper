But for $9.50 this is way too small and rather tasteless overall. \n<br />#burpple
Purple potato taste was milder than expected and seemed to be overpowered by the sea salt one. BUT still good and love the chips as well!

Small potato??? Haha.... Small potato is an Ice Creamy known for its Japanese Purple Yam Softserve. \n<br />#burpple\n<br />#eatoutsg \n<br />#sgfoodie \n<br />#yelpelite \n<br />#sgfoodie \n<br />#openrice \n<br />#8dayseat\n<br />#i8mondays\n<br />#sgigfoodies\n<br />#eatbooksg\n<br />#whati8today\n<br />#thefoodiehub\n<br />#igcommunity\n<br />#cravenonstop\n<br />#hungrygowhere \n<br />#cafehoppingteam \n<br />#fatclayfood
Because ice-cream is always a great idea! Enjoying the Purple Yam Ice-Cream with Purple Yam Paste Dorayaki here @smallpotatoesicecreamery üç¶ The ice-cream had a smooth and milky texture without being too rich and was perfectly complemented by a generous serving of crispy rice, purple yam and Azuki beans. A perfect afternoon treat in the sweltering heat!

Chose this Purple Yam Party which basically had everything in for toppings. \n<br />However, by the time all that were done and the dessert handed to me, it was already dripping all over.\n<br />It was flavoured by the purple powder, yam paste and everything else purple which had a subtle flora-like fragrance. Varied textures were experienced with the crispy rice, crispy yam fingers, chewy mochi and soft yam paste. Unfortunately, the fast-melting softserve didn\'t allow much time to enjoy the dessert.\n<br />There was no queue at the stall and yet service was lacking with little effort to welcome any customer or promote its menu. #burpple #BurppleSG #dessertsg #dessertgram #desserttime #dessertlover #dessertphoto #instafood_sg #instadessert #sgfoodies #sgfood #matcha #setheats #whati8today #foodgasm #foodieSG #foodieSG #sgeats #sgmakandiary #STFoodTrending #sgigfoodies #foodstagram #smallpotato #purpleyam
