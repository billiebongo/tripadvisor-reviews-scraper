Lightly seasoned with salt to taste. Grilled light to ensure no parts carry a smoky, charred flavour. Complimented with buttered grilled potato strips and broccoli which was soft and flavourful
Firm yet tender chicken patties marinated in thick Teriyaki sauce which had a light saltish flavour with two molten eggs with soft egg whites and flowy yolks.
Pretty place, love the food and ambience.
Oishi! My favorite ramen in black pepper !

Priced at $19.90 during lunch, this is every beef lover\'s dream come through. Pro tip: apply a pinch of wasabi on a slice of meat, then place it atop a small serving of rice. That\'s DIY wagyu beef sushi for you!\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #hungrygowhere #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #8dayseat #sgig #igsg #yoursingapore #visitsingapore #cafehoppingsg #sgcafe #cafesg #tslmakan #instafood_sg #eatoutsg #sgcafefood #burpple #burpplesg #exsgcafes #setheats #sgfoodtrend #sgfoodsteps #sgigfood #sgmakandiary #sgfoodporn #foodpornsg #exploresingapore #singaporeinsider
One of the signature dish of Sindaeme Bun Ji. .\n<br />🔽\n<br />The proportionaly sliced beef tongue, perfectly grilled and lightly seasoned. It is springy yet tender at the same time. Paired with pickled cabbage, it really balance the dish. Definitely a must try dish for a Gyutan lover like us 😋😋😋.\n<br />.\n<br />🔽\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #gyutan #burpple #hungrygowhere #whati8today #whatiate #japanesefoodsg #instafood_sg #oxtongue #headtotail #milleniawalk #grillfood #stfood #instafoodsg #igsg #igsgfood #vsco #sgrestaurant #sgrestaurants #japanesefood

.\n<br />🔽\n<br />Definitely the cause of my beefgasm plus food comma on that day. The roast beef was lean, meatty and tender. The sauce is bold, sweet and can be overwhelming. Surprisingly the ox tail soup get rids of the \'jelakness\' with ease. Definitely a must try!!\n<br />.\n<br />🔽\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #foodgasm #foodporn #foodpornsg #hungrygowhere #stfood #roastbeef #wagyubeef #wagyudon #instafood_sg #instafoodsg #8dayseatout #8dayseat #igsg #igsgfood #vsco \n<br />#foodgasm #beefgasm #sundayroast

Don\'t bother wasting money here... oxtail soup taste so bland, chawanmushi though smooth had this weird taste, the beef and ox tongue (their signature) overcooked. \n<br />#eatout #dinner #makanhunt #food #instafood #instafoodies #foodie #fotd #foodgram #foodinc #sgfood  #foodphotography #openricesg #burpple
