Tiny portion. (Spent a total of $258 on 8 dishes for 7 of us!)
Completely waste of money. The fish is tasteless!!! What a letdown
Dinner with @kengyang270 \'s family was a humongously jolly affair. We polished all 9 dishes + 1 yu sheng! First time I had so much crab in one sitting! Let\'s hope no rashes appear tonight! Amazing dinner!! :\') #food #foodporn #instafood #singapore #cny #jumbo #seafood
Salted Crab! The best crab I\'ve ever eaten! Superb! #foodporn #foodgasm
Just love the spiciness and the freshness of the crab. Be prepared for the price but this is definitely worthy!
There used to be less fried batter coating the tofu but nonetheless, it\'s still a pretty awesome dish.
So yummy...!\n<br />#dinner

well I wouldn\'t know cos I don\'t eat crab. the gravy is still pretty decent (ie. not great) but I wish the accompanying mantou (fried buns) didn\'t feel like they have been left at the counter top for a while before being served @igsg #igsg #foodpornasia #singapore #burpple #setheats #foodsg #sgfood #sgfoodie @sgfoodie #seafood #chillicrab #jumboseafood

Almost deceived by the outlook of the chicken as it  resembles roasted pork, very tender meat. The white cod fish is specially prepared basked in a special sauce, meat is so soft that it practically melts in the mouth. 👍👍👍👍\n<br />#burpple #pickyeaterssg #nomnomnom #foodstagram #foodie #foodsg #foodcoma #foodgasm #foodinsg #foodpics #foodspotting #foodstamping #foodphotography #dinner #instasg #instafood #instagood #instadelicious #chicken #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #sgfoodlover #sg #igsg #openricesg #hungrygowhere #fish #whati8today # hor fun #bambooclams
