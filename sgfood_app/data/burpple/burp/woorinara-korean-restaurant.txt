Craving satisfied ðŸ˜Š . Still my favourite budaejiggae so far.
First meal with the bf in over three weeks (he was in Thailand for reservist) and it had to be army stew. ðŸ˜… Nothing like having a craving satisfied. Extra ramyun and cheese ftw. And I absolutely love Woorinara\'s spread of banchan!
Army stew with my bffs @bahblahh @tingest ðŸ’– #budaejjiggae #korean
