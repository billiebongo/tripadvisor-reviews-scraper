Was pretty looking forward to the steamed fish from here and I wasn\'t disappointed at all ‚Äî the steamed fish here is not only full of flesh and is amazingly smooth and succulent, the soy sauce that it was steamed with was also worth raving about. The soy sauce tastes a lot like mum\'s cooking here ‚Äî light yet carrying a whiff of savoury flavours, it helps to add a little taste to the fish that simply antes things up by quite a notch; so complimenting, and hard not to love.
Amazingly fresh steamed fish at this coffee shop. Wide range of fishes to choose and various method of cooking your selected fish type. We love the white pomfret, steamed Hong Kong-style. 
One person portion of pork trotter, the meat and fatty parts slide off the bone when poke with chopsticks. The salted vegetables is creamy to taste matches the plain porridge. $5.30 is spent.
Usually normal Tze char styled stores open in the evening but they open from 7am till 3pm.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />Taste:Took a piece of the fish, dipped with their fresh Chilli sauce and it tasted pretty good. They kept it simple with just soy sauce and let the fish shine without over complicating the taste. .\n<br />.\n<br />Overall:One thing that I like is that the fish was fresh and was not overpriced like some Tze char stores. Service was good and food didn\'t take Long to arrive! Loads of working adults eating there, prob one of of their secret hideoutsüòÖ #ahungrywessg
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢\n<br />$30 - $250 (depending on pax)
This is just one of the many creative dishes this place offers. This is the malt covered yam &amp; sweet potato \'fries\'. Not the full portion thought because it was too delicious we gobbled quite a bit before I snapped this shot. They also have really good deep fried enoki mushrooms (!!!), the best melt in your mouth yam ring and incredibly fresh seafood. The shark tendons and other fish &amp; prawn dishes are a must try. These are only available at night while the curry fish head is available in the day.
west my hood and we have zai shun here.
my trump card for the westies. is like if the east folks were to challenge the west what we have, all of my beng inside me or the lack of it will gang shout, \"zai shun lei\" with thumb turned inwardly towards chest.
Westies should head down to Jurong east for amazing curry fish head. Other must try dishes: salted egg minced meat, hotplate tofu and fried squid.
very \"zai\". so is the awesome awesome fish game here very strong. salted egg bitter-gourd.
yesterday\'s collagen goodness - shark cartilage. fishes, your death is so tastefully glorified here at zai shun.
It\'s amazing how this dish contains all my least favourite vegetables/fruit (ahem brinjal, okra and pineapple)....but I love it so much! The fish was incredibly fresh as usual, meaty and cooked just right. The curry was thick, tangy from the addition of pineapple, tomatoes and pickled vegetables, and had a comfortable level of spice. The okra and brinjal tasted so good after being stewed in this magical gravy! The natural fragrance of brinjal, which I never knew existed cause all the brinjal I\'ve had were just bland and mushy, was actually accentuated by the curry. Also, try the Hong Kong style steamed fish. Actually, try any style. The fish here is so fresh, it will taste good anyway!
At this Teochew muay style coffee shop, loyal patrons swear by the decievingly simple dishes of salted egg bitter gourd, and the steamed mince pork with salted fish. Also known for super fresh steamed fish, you\'d be really missing out if you didn\'t order one for the table. 
#Yummy Chinese food for a light lunch. #Love the steamed fish!
Not a fish lover myself but daddy\'s favorite place for steamed fresh fishes. Come before 3pm &amp; be prepared for a little wait. 
We were so thrilled when we saw this dish. All of us love bitter gourd so we were very keen to try it out.\n<br />*\n<br />Bitter gourd, when cooked well, tastes heavenly and this was definitely one of the best I\'ve had. It wasn\'t too bitter and the salty egg yolk gave it a nice contrast. A must-order!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_zaishun #zaishun #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
We were served a large dish of hae bee hiam which was just the right condiment to complement the fish.

It was my first time eating rabbitfish. It was surprisingly good. Surprising because it didn\'t look at all appetising.\n<br />*\n<br />Steamed with kiam chye (preserved green mustard) and topped with the oh-so-sinful deep fried pork lard.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_zaishun #zaishun #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
In Ipoh where I grew up, we called it lam kor yue. A wild one is typically larger and the texture smooth and bouncy. Not like the farmed ones where the meat is sometimes flaky.\n<br />*\n<br />Such a simple yet tasty dish - steamed with soy sauce.\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_zaishun #zaishun #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious
Initially thought to be a shark but later confirmed as a ray and more closely related to a skate. It is cartilaginous and full of collagen.\n<br />*\n<br />It was my first time having it prepared with taucheo (fermented bean paste), garlic and chilli. Super delicious üòç. Even more so when you eat it with the generous helping of deep fried pork lard!\n<br />*\n<br />Thank you @vinopothamus and @ahpuicat for inviting us for lunch. Loved the food here. Fresh, tasty and cheap üòã. It was definitely worth the trip all the way to Jurong!\n<br />*\n<br />#hgfoodie_sg #hgfoodie_zaishun #zaishun #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #singapore #burpple #food #eat #whati8 #foodies #igfood #igfoodie #igfoodies #instafood #foodstagram #yummy #delicious

Diving for the jelly eyes and succulent cheeks, I was too unabashed, but I couldn\'t miss this! Perfectly steamed in Cantonese tradition (market price), the rest of this grouper is fleshy and firm, juicy and smooth with umami accents. Mild in flavour but lightly sweet, it\'s extremely fresh, devoid of so much as a hint of fishiness. In a pool of light soy sauce, the gravy lends a gentle touch of  it\'s a straightforward dish that\'s so simple yet so perfectly done you might even prefer having it on it\'s own. It might be one of the best I\'ve had.\n<br />.\n<br />Full Review: http://bit.do/herecomesgin-Zai-Shun
