Tried the newly moved Macpherson BBQ  seafood from lavender food square at balestier market. Didn\'t have any impression of it from its lavender store. Then I realised why. The fried rice and stir fried vege was too salty. The BBQ stingray was average as the sambal was just spicy with no kick. 
Formerly from Longhouse Food Centre on Upper Thompson Road, this famous stall is now selling its delicious fried banana, fried \"chempedak\" and whole repertoire of other fried goodies at Balestier Market. They are incredibly crunchy and are as delicious as ever. I really like the lightness of their batter which surprisingly, is not as oily as you\'d expect. 
Judging by the never-ending queue during the entire time I was there having dinner, this well-known chicken rice stall still manages to draw a crowd. The spread you see in my photo costs $32.60, which is pretty reasonable for four people. In terms of taste, I found the chicken to be only average (the breast meat was dry). I liked the chilli sauce though - it\'s spicy and had a touch of lime and sweetness. What I also enjoyed was the soup as it\'s very sweet and flavourful, thanks to the chicken stock and groundnuts used to brew it.
Cheapest bowl is SGD5\n<br />Prawns are fresh, but noodles and soup are average only.

In addition, it also comes with lean meat, pork liver, tofu and meat balls.
The chicken rice at Balestier market was really amazing. The fragrant rice, when matched with the tender chicken was really a moment to savour üòãTo me, the most difficult part of the chicken to cook is the chicken breast, and yet this place managed to cook it to perfection. It\'s really affordable too, definitely worth a try if the boon tong kee queue next door is too long ü§£ #ahungrywessg #burrple .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#whati8today #singapore #sgfoodie #foodie #beautifulcuisines #foodforthought #lunchhour #lunchdinner #lunch #sgeats #vscofood #topcitybites #hungrygowhere #eatoutsg #visitsingapore #localfood
I must say the chicken is very well done and it\'s almost like the quality I had in Ipoh. This set comprises of Hainanese chicken and Kai Lan, and either rice or congee. The entire set costs only $5.80. :) #balestiermarket #bugischuenchuen #chickenrice #jifan #foodie #foodporn #foodpath #foodvsocam #foodstagram #foodrecommendation #burpplesg #burpple
The sauce is on the sweet side instead. I could not really taste the spiciness. Unlike the creamy yangpa onion chicken, the sauce did not go as well with the fried chicken.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #koreanfriedchicken #hawkerfood
Marinated for 12 hours and deep fried to crispy, the Creamy Yangpa Onion Chicken ($10/$16) is further topped with fresh onions and a sweet creamy onion sauce. The creamy sauce complements the succulent chicken excellent. This is indeed quite delectable.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #koreanfriedchicken #hawkerfood

Uniquely found here, Balestier Hawker Ctr.
ü§î This olive fried rice has a very special taste: tangy from the lime, sweetness from the fish floss and saltiness from the olives. \n<br />#sgfood #olive #friedrice #burpple
Still prefer the dry version as the soup is richer and more intense. \n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #prawnnoodle
The prawns are juicy and finely sliced, while the soup captured the essence of the prawn flavour, balanced with the taste of onion.

At an exorbitant price of $2 at their new place in Balestier market, Miao Sin Popiah still attracts the crowds. I was lucky to be the third last person at 745pm. It was still as good as I rmb it to be at Lavender Market. It has a nice amt of garlic and crispy thingies. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Really shiok but really spicy!! üëÖüí¶

This is pretty good! Fishballs are big and springy. Soup wasn\'t too salty and noodles are not too oily. $4.50 and portion was good. Wasn\'t too impressed with Balestier food market earlier but it\'s gotten better. The oyster omelet was also good $8 for pretty big fresh ones. Will be back more often now!
