Order took awhile that day but it\'s still great 👍! Banana French toast with two huge scoops of vanilla ice cream, mixed fruit yogurt bowl, cake, matcha and chai latte!
Haven\'t been here in some time. Prices have increased but the menu has changed - the big breakkie definitely did not have a chorizo sausage last time. The sausage was a pleasant surprise - not as salty as I expected it to be. Pity my egg was broken and the bread was a little stale-tasting. That candied bacon though... still the best.
I couldn\'t resist revisiting One Man this morning. Their Gashouse Eggs were so indulgent that I had to try something else on the list. The French Toast with Berries and Marscopone could easily feed two! The cheese was light and airy and the toast was perfectly dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar. $18pp (including drinks)
Gashouse Eggs @onemancoffee for brunch today. Although the egg in the toast wasn\'t runny (never felt more disappointed in my life), the flavor of the bacon jam made up for it! We had a meal and two drinks for under $40. Excellent brunch spot!
More eggs! Seems like something I can\'t live without. Shot at @onemancoffee.
Tasteful plate that costs $12, (Gst &amp; Service charge inclusive on menu ald) wouldn\'t mind visiting again, because people here take pride in what they serve!!👍🏻
Starting the first weekend of December right with brunch at One Man Coffee and a freshly brewed cup of Magic ($6), which I found out is made using a double ristretto instead of espresso shots, hence giving it a stronger aroma and taste. Couldn\'t go wrong with Gashouse Eggs ($12): Egg-in-the-hole cheesy toast with candied bacon bits at the side, which tastes sort of like bak-kwa. The best thing about it has to be the brioche toast; so thick and fluffy with crispy edges and subtly sweet. 😊
First time visiting One Man Coffee (ok i cant seem to tag the correct location hmm). Judging from the previous reviews, looks like the price went up. Paid $12 for this. The Gashouse Egg is brioche toast with egg in the middle (mine was a bit cooked tho, so it didnt flow alot). The bacon jam is really nice and with the cheese 😍😍. Would come back again but its a bit pricey IMO
Let\'s go~
Stringy four cheese and my favourite candied bacon. 😋\n<br />#OneManCoffee #Bacon #CafeHopping #Cafe
I think I may have eggcidentally stumbled upon my new favourite dish at One Man Coffee at Upper Thomson from their revamped menu. Two oozy eggs with Spanish chorizo and garbanzo beans in a tomato base then topped with crushed wasabi peas! Dip the sourdough rye into the mix or, as I prefer, just inhale spoonfuls of everything! Warm, hearty and such good value. Now I can\'t decide which to have on my next visit—this or the Grilled Four-Cheese Sandwich. 😝\n<br />#OneManCoffee
Apart from that, you need to get the all time favorite - Gashouse Eggs. If you don\'t know what it is, you need to get yourself a portion right now. \n<br />Perfect for the lazy day! \n<br />P/S: Their new brunch menu is now  available at myVillage as well! 🙌🏼
This Furikake Mushroom Pasta ($12) serves with juicy fresh cherry tomatoes and earthy mushrooms. Furikake peppers the pasta with umami and the onsen egg adds a nice touch. Great for a light, savoury brunch and some chill time in this café. That, I really need. Along with sleep with all the artwork I\'ve been rushing 😪
Brunch with the boy 👦🏽 to start the weekend came with Big Brekkie ($12). It\'s brunch sweetness with honey ham and sweet, toasted cherry tomatoes. It serves with 6 min hard boiled eggs you let run over hard slices of grilled sourdough rye, and a porky sausage for meat protein. I liked the side of baby spinach with pesto. The added candied bacon (+$2) had me think of Bak Kwa (Chinese BBQ pork slices) charred a slight tough with lots of sugar glaze. Their butter mushrooms ($2) aren\'t a good flavour (so not again). This makes a good meal to get out off the house for if you\'ve got a sweet palate. I miss me a chill café brunch with the boy! ☹️
One thing that amazes me at One Man Coffee most of the time is how they often get creative with their croissants — it\'s not the usual ham and cheese thing or egg mayo ones you would find here; this newly-introduced item on their new menu features Duck Rillette, mustard and pickles between the same croissant they use for their other croissant sandwiches. The flaky, crispy and buttery croissant works well with the briny duck rillette which is made easier to it with the pickles that introduces a tart zestiness to the croissant with the mustard to even out all the flavours together. Comes served with Sweet Potato fries which are crisp and bursting with its natural sweetness.
One Man Coffee drops their new menu this week, tweaking some of their items from the previous menu and introducing some new ones as well. This is one of the newer items which is a umami burst of flavours especially with the furikake lacing the strands of pasta, coupled with the earthiness of mushrooms and the burst of freshness by the cherry tomatoes. Really simple yet light eat if you are craving for a pasta yet want to go for one that isn\'t particularly too filling or heavy. Don\'t forget to mix up that Onsen egg which magically binds everything together for a smoother touch!
Slice it in the center and the egg yolk oozes out like lava. Loved how it went with the bacon jam. Recommended!
Very limited food to choose from the menu but they sure do serve good coffee.
4.5 munchies: Rich, buttery brioche with an excellent crust that was so fragrant. The candied bacon served here is to die for – it was sticky, savoury and slightly crispy. Topped with crunchy walnuts and sprinkled with icing sugar, who needs maple syrup when you\'ve got some awesome homemade berry jam at the side?
Toasted, crisp corners and soft-fluffy center! The slice of warm brioche bread was really good on its own, with a slight sweetness and buttery fragrance but much much better when topped with melted cheese. Cut right down the middle, and you will reveal the luscious egg yolk oozing out nicely. If that isn’t enough, please do add-on an extra side of addictive candied bacon and button mushrooms (Best decision ever!).

Not the best flat white I\'ve had, not the worst either. Brunch items were reasonably priced and looked delicious; I may come back to try them.
French Toast with Berry Jam &amp; Walnuts ($10) &amp; Gashouse Eggs with Bacon Jam ($10) with a side of Buttered Shrooms ($3). Pair it with a cuppa with beans from @axilcoffeeroasters &amp; you\'ve got Sunday\'s brunch settled.
Craving the Breakfast Bun at One Man Coffee that\'s filled with bacon jam. And even more enjoyable with a side of candied bacon!\n<br />#OneManCoffee #WorkHardAnywhere *
Nice ambience, very friendly staff with good service and not forgetting the super yummy food at a reasonable price. For a sweet and savory brunch, I had the french toast (10$) with salted caramel/banana and the croissant (8$) which has a very flavorful truffle - Portion is just right for one to two in my opinion. Drink wise, the ice matcha latte has nothing much to rave about however the selection of tea they have (5$/pot) is rly wide. We tried the Sakura flavor which was not bad!! Would definitely come back again :-)
Went back to One Man Coffee for the newly-added menu items for their Thomson outlet; new items include this burger (a spinoff of the Vietnamese Pork Belly Sandwich from their Fusionopolis outlet), Breakfast Burger and the Chilled Soba — both items on the regular menu of One Man Coffee Fusionopolis. Drawing inspiration from the Vietnamese Banh Mi, One Man\'s version comes with their own twist by making the burger a little more saucey with the Sriracha Mayo but without overwhelming the entire burger. The Pork Belly was good considering it to be from a cafe; crispy skin with tender meat within while the pickled vegetables come tamer without being overly tangy to suit the lighter flavour profile to the burger. Even the vinaigrette dressing for the salad was a winner being veered towards a sweeter edge for a more Umami flavour that goes surprisingly well with the burger. A very comforting eat suitable for brunch despite the condiments, for the burger carried a good complexity of flavours without trying to confuse and still felt pretty clean even after finishing the entire plate. 
New items on the OMC menu at Upper Thompson—Chilled Soba ($10.0) &amp; Pork Belly Burger ($12.0).\n<br />Have been enjoying the cold soba since I tried it at the Fusionopolis outlet. A good option if you want a more refreshing dish. I love picking at the yummy charred sweet corn and sakura ebi!\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />“Do you know what it is like,\n<br />to lie in bed awake;\n<br />with thoughts to haunt\n<br />you every night,\n<br />of all your past mistakes.\n<br />⋅\n<br />Knowing sleep will set it right - \n<br />if you were not to wake.”\n<br />—Lang Leav\n<br />•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•\n<br />#OneManCoffee

Meat lovers rejoice!\n<br />Nice thick cuts of roasted pork belly with pickled veges and Sriracha Mayo.\n<br />My favourite Bacon Jam Breakfast Burger now has a contender vying for my stomach space. 😋\n<br />Remember to order candied bacon on the side! 😂\n<br />#OneManCoffee #PorkBelly
The banana-perfumed French toast had the soft, eager fluffiness of a Scottish terrier, whilst elsewhere the banana slices melted with the celerity of Snow Brand Neo Soft Spread on 12pm Jalan Buroh pavement. 4/5
// Starting it off with a great brunch session to hide away from the rainy weather.
from conceptualising to execution and running the campaign on @ffeinelanthropy, i cannot be more thankful for the guidance, trust and patience given. and what awesome journey it has been. a big big shout out to @onemancoffee and canossaville children\'s home for believing me and ffeinelanthropy. you would think 211 #OneManCoffee hashtags or $211 raised for Canossaville Children’s Home is nothing worthy. wrong, what is worthy is we have started a ripple. from the encouraging generosity from friends in the Instagram community and better yet, that One Man Coffee has decided to top up the amount to $1000! witness, the next coffee you buy has the power to give, champion a cause and inspire change. working hard on next campaign in April so that coffee gives back! #ffeinelanthropy #coffeeforgoodsg #coffeeforcharitysg #coffeegivesbacksg #charitycoffeesg
Fluffy french toast and caramelised banana, dulcified with your choice of salted caramel or fresh cream. The BEST combination!!
candied bacon is totally meant to kickstart the long weekend i tell you. Did you know from now till 31 Mar 2016, One Man Coffee is pledging $1 to Canossaville Children\'s Home for every valid post with the hashtag #OneManCoffeeCan. We can do our part for charity. Remember to hashtag your coffee or food shots when you next visit One Man Coffee! #ffeinelanthropy #coffeeforcharitysg #coffeeforgoodsg #charitycoffeesg
My picks are both the Brioche French Toast and Big Brekkie, though it\'d have been great if the six-minute eggs were slightly runnier. The sinfully addictive candied bacon would only leave you crave for more!
be bold, strong and as magical as coffee. Happy International Women\'s Day! #happyinternationalwomensday #OneManCoffeeCan
Weekend memories of this sun-kissed golden egg yolk… ever so slowly flowing down the side of the sourdough to caress the ripe tomatoes beneath. Now I\'m craving for runny egg yolks… 😏\n<br />“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.” —Oscar Wilde\n<br />#OneManCoffee #OneManCoffeeCan #BigBrekkie #EggPorn
Was around this area so decided to brunch here with @s_wei \n<br />#OneManCoffeeCan \n<br />#FoodInVertical \n<br />#FoodinHands
Weekend chill out sessions at One Man Coffee… nearly everyone I bring to One Man Coffee says the coffee is really good and better than a lot of other cafes. #OneManCoffee #OneManCoffeeCan #Coffee
Pure love is deliciously sweet candied bacon piled atop soft Brioche French Toast… My tip when dining at One Man Coffee: whatever you order, add a side of candied bacon. Even if your Big Brekkie comes with candied bacon, just order another side of candied bacon.\n<br />And these cravings has me rolling around in bed on Saturday mornings… drooling. If ever a need to get me out of bed… you know what food will do the trick.\n<br />#OneManCoffee #OneManCoffeeCan #CandiedBacon #FrenchToast
It was magical indeed. The coffee blends well with the milk. They used higher coffee to milk ratio (the staff described it as \"double flat white\") and the aftertaste was pleasant.
The ingredients are simple but makes for a very comforting breakfast. I always add mushrooms on the side just for some umami earthiness in the dish. Have this with a double shot coffee soda, and you are set for the day. \n<br />Ok, the picture is a little out of focus but hey the yummy bits are all clear! Haha. #onemancoffeecan
Start this month by doing something right. While enjoying a cup of coffee at One Man Coffee or their delicious cheesy Gashouse Egg ($10) with oo-hhh so good candied bacon jam, you can also help to contribute back to the society.
on another note, do you know that if you buy the cuppa at @onemancoffee and post it on ig with a hashtag #OneManCoffeeCan from now till end March, the cafe will pledge $1 to their chosen children\'s home.
For those who love your cheese and eggs, you\'ll love this.
This has got to be my all time way at OMC!!!! Super super unbelievably crunchy yummmmm $7 of tummy satisfying breakfast I say yes! hands down the best brunch place 
someone wiser once said, \"is very healthy to spend time alone. You need to know how to be alone and not be defined by another person\". thank you, I am very healthy.
My suggestion is to kick off the week with a coffee soda from @onemancoffee. I always have it with a double shot (preferably with beans from @axilcoffeeroasters) and a tad less sugar - a perfect refreshing boost to conquer the week!
The only thing worth waking up for even after only 4 hrs of sleep. Gotta learn to focus on only important things in life like work &amp; goals… and blog posts. 🤒\n<br />#OneManCoffee #❤️
Oh crap, caffeine buzz. // Tried the Githiga AB Espresso Blend from Workshop Coffee, London over the weekend, which were in the guest hopper! Had it as a Coffee Soda for that extra oomph with the sweet notes &amp; a clean finish.
☺️ Gashouse Eggs with a side of bacon jam &amp; buttered shrooms &amp; candied bacon! Talk about good breakfast 😋 // 
Ugh cravings. It\'s always a throw up between this and the Gashouse Eggs…  I need a bigger belly.\n<br />#OneManCoffee #FrenchToast #CoffeeAndCravings *
(And a lot more cheesy - ah ma Liu needs more calcium huh? 😹)
One Man Coffee is one of my favorite places. The people are friendly and the food and coffee are both unpretentious and affordable. French toast was $10, lattes start from $4.50. Salted caramel brioche french toast was delicious to me. I usually am not a fan of salted caramel and this was one of the saltier ones I\'ve tried. But when eaten together with the sweet caramelised bananas and fluffy brioche the whole combination is just sooooo good.
Such savoury \'big breakfast\' dishes are usually too rich for me, but this one I like. Spinach dressed in some nice balsamic vinegar, lovely onsen eggs, plump roasted tomatoes, mushrooms and candied bacon. Yum. The spinach and balsamic vinegar really serve to cut through the richness of the other components. That candied bacon... so good. 
$4.50 for a single and $5.50 for a double latte. The latte is reasonably priced and solid every time. 
I do mean that in a good way, of course. As usual, I\'m late to the food party again, but it sure didn\'t dampen my enjoyment of One Man Coffee\'s renowned Gashouse Egg (a.k.a. The Egg In the Bread With the Hole In the Middle With Bacon Jam).
But damn if it isn\'t good for your tastebuds and body as well. I simply love One Man Coffee\'s matcha latte. Full bodied, creamy and pleasantly sweet with just a tiny tiddlywink of matcha powder to remind you of what this really is? Yeah, I\'ll have ten of that.
Favourite cafe. ☺️ My brunch situation at 3pm whilst revamping my site.\n<br />⋅\n<br />#OneManCoffee #FrenchToast
One of my favourite cafes!!! Toast is unbelievably fluffy and soft, this simple looking $10 brioche got me at first bite. The banana didn\'t add enough flavor to the toast though (I would recommend the berries one more). $10 Signature Gashouse Eggs is accompanied by a unique bacon jam that will leave you wanting more mmmm! 
First brunch spot in weeks and it was an utter disappointment. We tried the apparently crowd-favourite Brioche French Toast, served with caramelised bananas, salted caramel and fresh cream. The thick slices of pan-fried brioche, though buttery and fragrant, were utterly dry. None of that egg-soaked goodness, nope. It makes a good brioche but a horrid French toast. The accompanying \'salted caramel\' was over-roasted, burnt, and extremely odd-tasting. It wasn\'t salted nor any bit caramel-ly. This was frankly one of the worst French toasts I\'ve had, and a huge waste of S$10.
Flat white at a reasonable price of $4.50. Considering that there\'s free wifi! Spent my afternoon there clearing some work. Closes at 5pm 
Big Brekkie ($12) and a cup of Hot Chocolate ($5)! Loved the Hot Chocolate, it was thick! The candied bacon in big brekkie made me drool. It was sweet, and went very well with bacon.The bacon was perfectly crisp. This dish isn\'t quite a big portion, which is great if you aren\'t that hungry but need a meal. Also, thumbs up for the presentation of the dish! Very instagram worthy. Great dish to have if you want good food and not spend so much, because this big brekkie is definitely worth it. 
Life is short, do treasure every moment with your family while you can. :)
Stay strong people! 💪💪💪 #thefoodjournalist #onemancoffee
They call their Salted Caramel Brioche French Toast ($10) \'some of life’s best things on a single platter\'. With impeccably fluffy brioche dusted with icing sugar, served with caramelised bananas, strokes of French cream and lashing of rich salted caramel, we couldn\'t have said it any better. As Tastemaker Shawn Loh puts it, \'it\'s as if the meal wants to smother me with pleasure\'. Their savoury Gashouse Egg with Bacon Jam ($10) is simple, honest, and hearty, but it truly kicks ass. With a runny egg sitting in the middle of a thick slice of brioche toast, it is blanketed in melted cheese and comes with a side of scrumptious bacon jam. Be sure to bring a friend, just so you can try both.
Today\'s Gashouse Eggs were rather disappointing, but it seemed like one of their really off days where the kitchen was getting very slow churning out orders as well. Waited for around 20mins for this, and when it came the egg yolk within that usually is flowy came fully-cooked and solid. Still, the bacon jam was delicious, as well as the melted cheese atop the bread which was stringy and savoury. 
Kinda disappointed that the menu didn\'t offer appetizers or finger food :( They had mostly brunch items so I had to order an extra truffle potato wedges from CRUST to keep my fingers busy. A great place for a catch up - considering how I could sit there for close to three hours! 
On a side note, their gashouse egg is delish (stringy cheese and eggy inside soft bread); brioche French toast was fluffy but tasted blah and banana was too soggy). Well, coffee made up for it. 
New challenges. Fuel up with coffee and have a great week everyone!
ITS SO GOOD AND SO WORTH IT!! each for SGD $10, the gashouse eggs are soo good together with the cheese and the brioche french toast is awesome when eaten all together (toast+banana+sauce) 
today\'s one man\'s coffee situation. i drink enough coffee but guilty of not knowing enough about coffee. that said, i know a good one when i see one.
A reliable place for brunch whenever I need some comfort food alone. 
This $7 croissant was so crispy and flaky oh my simply heavenly sigh so simple but so delicious mmmm and the $10 brioche french toast was great as usual! 
Finally got to indulge in one of my favourite brunches again after so long. Very happy (๑¯◡¯๑)
🌼Rate: 7.5/10\n<br />Overall taste okay but can\'t really taste the matcha and v.milky taste. :D BTW IS AT ONE MAN COFFEE @UPPER THOMSON
Singaporean\'s Guide To Ulu Café Hopping
Brioche French Toast (SGD $10) - Thick &amp; fluffy brioche French toast topped with caramelised bananas, addictive salted caramel sauce and fresh creme at the side. The combination makes it the perfect all-out indulgent dish at any time of the day with a cup of their coffee. So far is still one of my favorite french toast place.
Brioche French toast was a little bland instead of sweet. I prefer the Gashouse Egg to Brioche French Toast. As for the drinks, it was a HUGE disappointment! I couldn\'t taste the matcha at all. 
I\'ve heard so much about the coffee served at One Man but left a tad disappointed as it did not quite live up to expectations. Pictured is the flat white ($4.50).
I always love the coffee served by One Man.... Love the aroma of their coffee brew and always awake my soul.... 
〰 $12
Both the French toast and the Gashouse eggs are really amazing :) The bacon jam and the bread with cheese is like the best combination ever yummm ☺️even though my friend and I got lost on our way here but all of these brilliant food makes it worth the trip 😙
$10, topup $3 for candied bacon. A bit too char. But like its crispy edged toast. The bacon jam has texture similar to hiam bee ( dried shrimp floss).
lacking in drive and having much inertia. it\'s probably a sign
Topped with sinful chunks of caramelized bananas, this is quite simply one of the best french toasts in Singapore
{Gashouse Eggs} Love the composition of savoury melted cheese, creamy runny egg yolk, and fluffy &amp; delicately sweet brioche. The bacon jam is another star in its own right. It reminds me of a more refined version of bak kwa.
It was fluffy &amp; eggy!🍞 Brioche French toast x ☕️ latte kick off my Saturday with @rennie_mun #brunch #burpple
Undoubtedly one of the best brioche French toast I have ever tried - the brioche is fluffier than an Angora rabbit and decidedly un-breadlike in texture. Paired with the restrained salted caramel and goreng pisang-esque sweet and gooey banana chunks, it\'s as if the meal wants to smother me with pleasure. 4.2/5
Love the straightforward and reasonably-priced selection here. Coffee\'s a little acidic for my liking but the affable service more than made up for it. 
Fluffy French Toast ($10) and flavorful ice latte ($5.50), the best combination for a sunny Tuesday. 
First time I am here without ordering the French Toast. Never regretted it though; the Gashouse Eggs make for a great breakfast option for there\'s a runny egg in between in the brioche covered with oozy melted cheese and with a twist of flavour with the subtly sweet Brioche. Bacon jam was sweet-savoury sensation, especially when dabbed atop the cheesy brioche!
Brioche French Toast ($10) with homemade berry compote and fresh cream. The compote went really well with the cream and toast, and it wasn\'t too sweet! The walnuts gave us something to chew on. 
Soft fluffy, sweet &amp; savoury with a side of ice cream and candied bacon. 😊 
No doubt it has been an amazing year. On the side note, miss the makan khakis 🙊 Anw, here\'s Brioche French Toast with Caramelized Bananas.☝️
The only cafe that steal my heart away with their french toast and caramelized banana. So nice and worth it that i\'m dying to be back. 
OMC Staff Celebration for Christmas! Handmade tapas &amp; chocolate log cake from Cedele! Jolly good day indeed! 
Good but I think I still prefer the one with their homemade jam.
One Man Coffee\'s gashouse egg with that awesome bacon jam. @kattthleen
The brioche french toast was light and soft inside with a thin crisp outer layer, bacon (added) was fatty and a good portion, but that sauce was the bomb, the best of it\'s kind. #burpple
Stress do not exist in the presence of food and great company ☺️
French toast was pretty moist with its flavors that was offered to us, at their unique combination of caramelized banana came in perfectly which has given us a pretty smooth ending aftertaste😛 
For a kind pleasure of your own, One Man Coffee may not serve the best coffee in town. But when their neighbors are all crowded on the weekend, you may consider this as your second choice 😉
Review on #onemancoffee up on fatassbean.wordpress.com!
I\'m at #onemancoffee to do my part! The french toast and gashouse eggs were awesome!😍
It\'s not a banana bread but it\'s a banana french toast and it\'s so good, it\'s close enough. Banana French toast with salted caramel!
This is so gorgeous, I can\'t bare to sink my teeth in. Thick layers of chocolate is simply satisfying! 
Time seems to be passing more and more quickly, and that\'s always a good thing cos I can never wait for the weekends to roll around 😊 The root beer cake was just too strange for our liking, but the lavender one was light, moist and quite delightful. 
Nevermind that one of the eggs came a little torn – the yolks tasted marvelous smeared on the sourdough toast, of which I wish there had been more of. The roasted cherry tomatoes, though, plump and bursting with warm, sweet juices, were the highlight of this platter.

What\'s better than spending your Tuesday indulging in one of the best brioche French toasts in town, or tucking into their Toad in the Hole eggs with irresistible bacon jam for lunch? By finishing it all off with a silky smooth coffee of course. On December 2nd, One Man Coffee is doing their part for children with chronic illnesses by generously donating all their sales to Club Rainbow. It\'s not often you get to do good while brunching, so this is your chance to eat and drink for a fantastic cause. If you live in the area, mark your calendar and have breakfast or brunch here!
Having great with this big breaky... But the cherries tomato not really in mind...
A signature item indeed. Love the way the runny egg is enveloped in the thick toast engulfed with melted cheese. The bacon jam reminds me of coarsely shredded bak-kuah.
But wish I could be heading for coffee first 😂. Have a great week everyone! :) #OneManCoffee #CoffeeAndCravings
I need this French toast with toasted bananas, salted caramel and fresh cream badly. Lots of icing please and an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream.
Rich, dense, chocolatey cake with subtle root beer flavour &amp; cream cheese frosting. A scoop of ice-cream to pair with the cake would be perfect! 🍰🍦
A tang of root-beerness on the tongue.\n<br />And whoo hoo!~ Public holiday tomorrow. Where\'s everyone headed to pig-out??? #CoffeeAndCravings will be dining at Ambush for dinner. Sign up if you haven\'t already 😉
Fresh and crunchier big brekkie with additional butter mushrooms. Love the crunchy and sweet tomatoes.
Back this time for leisure &amp; not work. This dish never fails to make me happy, especially my all time fav - BACON JAM 😍 
Love the soft fluffy Brioche French Toast at #OneManCoffee, but it\'s even better with an added side of bacon! ƪ( ‎​♡ ε ‎​♡ )ʃ \n<br />Looking forward to the day I can spend my days working out of cafes with the sunlight smiling down on me. Have a great day everyone! 😊
A great way to start the day!
Soft fluffy French Toast, sweet jam, cream and salty bacon!!! How not to have bacon with everything?! The perfect complement to every meal. 🐷

Cheese ham croissant with additional mushrooms that are not too overpowering along with candied bacon. Yums! Total damage? $10
The candied bacon is really yummy! Remind me to order a double portion! Matcha Latte is a little too sweet for me! Salted Caramel Croissant is YUMS! if only they will toast it slightly.

It\'s good to have brunch places near home! Because you can eat brunch any time you want, or not since they do close early. :p But it is a great addition to rhe cafe culture in Thomson! 
Here we go again........ Ooooze...... Glorious egg yolks 😍 
Finally trying out this cafe. Brunch was delicious with friendly price tags. Big brekkie at $12, no service charge. I\'m enjoying my weekend so far :)
Enjoyed the warm welcome and gracious hospitality extended to me and Alain over there! They coffee is good, really good.
Thank you Adalric for the pour and the bosses for the magic.
Two more days to go!!Woo hoo! ✌️😎 Thank you very much to @d_z for this #shot at #onemancoffee !I drink #coffee very regularly, thus this shot!😅😂 Gentle reminder to @melvyn_caffeine to post yours please. 😝😁
They are open daily 9am-5pm, come by for coffee and awesome all day brunch.
mocha x iced chocolate x eggs in toast x big brekkie 
I got a swan! Woots. 
Beautiful swan latte art
Green tea cake that was not too sweet and you can actually taste the green tea. 👍👍 a cuppa magic and a salted caramel Danish. After hopping so much cafes. I realized that most of them get their pastries from the same supplier. Thank god it\'s pretty good though. 
:) the gashouse egg and brioche french toast are a-w-e-s-o-m-e, and the hot chocolate was one of the best I\'ve had in awhile! (Belated) welcome to the neighbourhood!! ^^ #foodstamping #foodporn #foodspotting #burpple #brunch #breakfast
First stop: One Man Coffee! Magic ($4.50) was a tad too strong and acidic for me but Cappuccino ($4.50) was good! Decided to pair the coffee with an Almond Croissant ($4.50)! :)
That is because my life is often filled with coffee and yummy bites. And of cos, of happiness and love! 😊
Thanks to the cup of Flat White and the French Toast Brioche that I had earlier today. 💖
Try their renown 6 min eggs and you can add on sides such as their candied bacon, cherry tomatoes and mushroom for an additional cost! 
Too many cafés with too few real kitchens in Singapore means a diarrhea of eggs benedictation - most are slaphappy in assembling (thinking of an eponymously named place near the Botanic Gardens...) pieces of food cooked in toaster ovens or convection heaters, and passing that off as brunch*. Eggs Benedict are thankfully off the bored... I mean, board at One Man Coffee, which has a simple menu of strong ingredients served deftly. This grilled cheese on sourdough rye has everything in place, from just enough tasty butter to crisp the bread to beautifully bubbled cheese. Small ambition, big payoff. Get the baby spinach salad with feta, pine nuts and prosciutto shreds to top it off, and toast to breakfast.
Still that same custard-soaked pillowy Brioche toasts, with cranberry jam and crunchy, sweet candied walnuts and cream, which they could be more generous with though.
Brunch~ #foodporn #eggporn #burpple
Love the healthy range of colours on the plate! Tastes good too—according to those who tried it. $12. #coffeeandcravings
The perfect breakfast for oozy yolk egg lovers! The bacon jam is sweet yet savoury and goes well with the toast where a hole is made in the middle for the egg to sit in and cooked just right. Simple honest food. Must try! $10. #coffeeandcravings
If anything, I would go back for the food. Simple and no frills menu. Perfect for a quick bite and a caffeine fix. The latte here was a little flat for me though, my friend\'s flat white was even more robust. 
Ordered something different today - Frat White. Good to see familiar faces around!
This cafe serves one of the best coffee in Singapore. The brioche was so pillow-y soft and moist as it was soaked in egg mixture. Read more: http://www.misstamchiak.com/one-man-coffee-upper-thomson-road/
Who doesn\'t love freshly brewed coffee with milk steamed to perfection? Each table is also decorated with a bottle of flowers. Flowers + coffee = ❤️
Cakes from Edith Patisserie! The combination of salted caramel &amp; banana was pure genius I must say! Not too overpowering &amp; makes you want to take another bite almost instantly! Yay! 
Managed to catch a good cuppa coffee with the awesome French Toast before the folks close for the day. 
Had to try their French toast since it\'s the signature dish. Made from brioche bread, with glazed walnut; berries and compote. At $10, the serving is a little small (not filling) but the bread was really fluffy and crispy on the outside. People with sweet tooth may find this a little less sweet. Would be perfect if it\'s drizzled with some honey or maple syrup. 
And Magic coffee to start the day. So happy to find a brunch place near my home! 
The lemon cake tasted very sour but I love it - has passion fruit jam fillings between the layers. The croissant was crispy and buttery and goes nicely with the jam (which was sour too but yes, I love sour stuff coz \"我是酸的\"👅).
Crispy &amp; fluffy croissant served with honey baked ham &amp; cheese! Such a good treat to rid the Monday blues! Served with a side of mushrooms at 2$! 
Good coffee. Good vibe. Packed even on Mondays. Best of all, captured a sign of kindness, saw the barista gave a street paddler a cup of free coffee. Will visit again.
Egg down centre, toasted brioche &amp; BACON JAM! 😋 
that moment during de weekend which you\'ll think to urself - fuck! its monday tomorrow and I haven even rested. happy sundays to all!
Last cup of Axil coffee!! No more #axil #coffee beans liao!! Shadowy shot as I\'m just beside the window. 😪
aint really convinced this dish is worth 10bucks. just a  simple bakrd egg and cheese in a bread. but the bacon muffin was really well done.
A cafe by the alley.. Specialty coffee concept focuses on art of the espresso.. Ordered the cafe latte, egg in the hole.. Very interesting combo! Must try for weekend coffee session.. 
Nice coffee, ambience and brunch. Drop by one man coffee if you happen to wander around upp thomson! Highly recommend their ham and cheese.  croissant . 
Coupled it with a Salted Caramel Danish from B.A.O. The combination was simply extraordinary! 
Coffee beans from Strangers\' Reunion. 4.6/5. @trulysherena Y you no come??!!LOL!
Ethiopia Sidamo Suke Quto | Creamy texture, with notes of honey, grape and sparking tangerine.
Pretend it\'s not Monday and Eat On.
One man brekkie with three add-on, one raspberry chocolate cake, one magic coffee and one affogato all in one sitting #PleaseDontJudge 😂
Can\'t make up my mind on the add-on for candied bacon or the avocados. Sarah strongly recommend the butter mushrooms with capers. And so I decided to have everything. Happy Weekend beautiful people!
Saturday brunch after prayers at Bright Hill Temple, since it\'s so near from Sin Ming I popped by for some good food and coffee. 
This new kid on the Thomson block is a lovely new space that offers simplicity at its best. Sharing a space with Crust (which takes over after 5pm), One Man Coffee serves up superb brioche French toast and Toad in the Hole eggs with bacon jam that has everyone swooning. They also carry small pastry bites from Bakery Artisan Original (BAO). Photo by Alain Foodology
Need a refill for the week.
The Peanut Butter Banana Cake is insanely awesome and to die for!

Very cosy cafe with rustic and wooden furnitures all over yet stylish look .. The browned toast with the sunny side up was perfectly good with the bacon jam bites.. Yummy 
I\'m a breakfast type of guy. Don\'t get me wrong. I just enjoy eating French Toast, and Breakfast is my kind of thing.
Newest coffee place at Upper Thomson road. An essay in refined acidity, balanced with a continuing aromatic dominate. 
Toad in a hole aka gashouse egg whatever you call it. It\'s basically egg in the bread with the hole in the middle. The bacon jam is love!!!!
Spending an afternoon in this 3 week old cafe that is an absolute gem. They may only have a pizza oven to work with but you can hardly detect their limitations when you taste their food!
irresistible French toast that comes soft and moist!
Custard soaked Brioches that was soft and eggy with candied walnuts and fresh cream. Never tasted a French Toast this divine ...
a creamy flat white goes a long way!
Looked great but was limp. Lovely salted caramel filling in the middle and buttery pastry. Could have been way better if fresher. Supplied from B.A.O
Slightly too milky to my liking. Staff claims that they use the same beans as Stranger\'s Reunion.
Sweet potato fries were crispy and remained so throughout the meal 😋
🥓 I must say the candied bacon is just like really nice Bak Kua!! The mix was a good spread sausage with scrambled eggs (we order onsen egg but they got it wrong) salad🥗, crispy toast 🍞 lovely cherry tomatoes 🍅 and mushrooms 🍄

This particular French Toast ticks all the right boxes, if only it could be more eggy in the middle. 🍞\n<br />.\n<br />Caramelised bananas is a classic combination &amp; the overall dish isn’t overly sweet as well (you can keep your leg the next day) A decent basic French Toast. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #onemancoffee #frenchtoast #caramelisedbanana #brunch #caramelised #cafe
It’s basically two shots of espresso instead of one along with milk. Hence it’s a tad stronger than your regular Flat White. In which I desperately need to survive the day &amp; especially the night. 🍸\n<br />.\n<br />One Man Coffee uses coffee beans from both Nylon Coffee Roasters @nyloncoffee which it’s one of the Best in SG (at least for me) &amp; Axil Coffee Roasters with seasonal espresso blend from Australia the Land down under. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #TastyTastemakerTour #onemancoffee #flatwhite #coffee #nyloncoffee #axilcoffeeroasters
This particular French Toast ticks all the right boxes, if only it could be more eggy in the middle. 🍴\n<br />.\n<br />Add 💵S$3 for a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream that just compliments the French Toast so well like Peanut Butter &amp; Jam, Sailor Jerry Rum &amp; Ginger Ale &amp; etc. However, the Banana French Toast Faired better. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #TastyTastemakerTour #onemancoffee #cafe #brunch #berries #frenchtoast #vanillaicecream #vanilla #icecream #SugarCakePie
I do love French toast and this one definitely didn\'t disappoint with a lovely crispy exterior and fluffy interior soaked in vanilla ice cream!! The caramelised banana completed the dish with an additional kick 😍 \n<br />Had a lot of fun on Burpple\'s tastemaker tour with everyone else!\n<br />Some info for the place:\n<br />The French toast was 12++ (15++ with vanilla ice cream) which is not too expensive.\n<br />The cafe itself was nice and cosy; not too crowded for a Saturday afternoon\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #café #brunchfood #frenchtoast #sgfood #tastytastemakertour #icecream #dessert

Icy cold, tangy goodness. The type that makes you scrunch up your face when the sourness hits your tastebuds, but you keep going back for more of the icy cool drink to combat the Singapore heat. 🍹
If you\'ve not known, @onemancoffee has expanded their menus slightly to include pastas, chilled soba &amp; a couple of sides to spruce up the menu! \n<br />One of my new favorites would be the Furikake Mushroom Pasta ($12) which is simple, yet packed with umami flavors from the shrooms &amp; furikake! Break up the onsen egg (#eggporn moment) &amp; mix them all together to give you that slight creaminess to add the additional texture. \n<br />Pair it alongside either blends from @axilcoffeeroasters or the single origin from @nyloncoffee &amp; you\'ve got yourself a decent meal under $20! \n<br />Always good to see up with familiar faces &amp; catch up on where life takes us at this point in time 😌\n<br />•\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG

Lovely cup of Mocha to wind down the busy week...
recently I\'ve been really hooked onto these truffle things, but this bowl of truffle pasta from the famour Garcons, that pride themselves on french cuisine, fell quite short from my high expectations. I could hardly taste the truffle, and the pasta was not served piping hot too. However, the runny onsen egg, and well it being carbonara certainly still made it rather satisfying for a hungry boy. \n<br />I wonder if they serve truffle pasta in HK though... T -9 to the land of Golden Lava Ooze

• Homely cosy ambience. • Ordered Ice Matcha Latte ($6) and Ice Mocha ($6.50). Matcha Latte have a subtle taste of matcha and mainly the taste of soy milk(?) Don\'t expect to get Starbucks Green Tea latte standard! • Caramelized Banana Brioche French Toast ($10). Fluffy light toast accompanied by sweet caramelized bananas and whipped cream. Perfect combination but serving size is pretty small! 
All prices are nett ✌️ They offer simple breakfast items such as Ham and Cheese Croissant [$7] and their Big Brekkie [$13]. They are open from 9-5pm.

For a perfect weekend 😊
Overrated and dry :/
Have been reading many reviews about cafés at Upper Thomson Road, and finally ventured up north. ordered coffee and a slice of cake. Coffee is pretty good, you can actually see the barista creating latte arts carefully for each cup of coffee, literally making it a one man coffee show. Cakes were nothing to shout about but would love to come back to try their brunch menu.
They are called Saturday &amp; Sunday 😜

...just what i needed; my boys and a good ol\' cup of flat white. // day 89 • #100happydays
Have heard rave reviews about the French Toast and sure wasn\'t disappointed at all. Very fluffy bread toast drenched in homemade berry jam and a dollop of fresh cream. And I think I tasted cinnamon in it. $10 for 2 piece of bread might be slightly overpriced, but with the accompanying bad ass embellishment, I think it\'s pretty worth it :) Oh and I realise what a difference natural lighting can do to your photo.

Not mine though. haha!
