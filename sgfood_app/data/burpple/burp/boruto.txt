One of the freshest oysters I\'ve had in a long while all the way from Japan. Paired with a nice cup of sake and it\'ll be all so perfect!
This is a dish which I feel really showcases Chef Angus culinary skills. The exterior of the cod was crispy and smoky, while the flesh of the cod remained moist and tender, full of the sweetness of the oils of this succulent cod fish.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I also like to mix a little of that aged miso sauce (just a little of it) which was intense and deeply umami. And that pumpkin wasn\'t a side show here, it\'s sweetness and aroma was accentuated through the roasting so it was deeply satisfying as well.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting.
.
So good. I love Alaskan crab legs because I find them sweeter and more delicate, and this totally brightened up my evening.\n<br />🔸\n<br />I especially like the ponzu sauce here which was flavourful but not too strong. Drizzle a little into the avocados and cherry tomatoes salad, or add a little onto the crab legs for some umami and zest. You may realise you have finished this dish too quickly.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during a tasting hosted by @borutosingapore and @anguschow1982.
Totally drank up all that sake sauce which brings that sweetness of the prawns out. New menu at @borutosingapore as they reached their 2 years\' mark and Chef @anguschow1982 has once again created fusion tapas that goes really well with sake.
.\n<br />^Oyster + Ponzu (S$18.80++)\n<br />^Tuna + Caviar (S$22.80++)\n<br />^Salmon + Ikura (S$15.80++)\n<br />^Tori Charcoal Karaage (S$10.80++)\n<br />^Gindara Pumpkin Miso (S$18.80++)\n<br />^Ebi Niniku Yaki (S$18.80++)\n<br />^Charcoal Hiyashi Noodles (S$15.80++)\n<br />.\n<br />Since only quality Japanese ingredients are used for the tapas, you won\'t go wrong with any of them. But my personal favourites are the Oyster+Ponzu, Ebi Niniku Yaki and Tori Charcoal Karaage! Try and let me know if you agree!\n<br />.\n<br />Where to find this?\n<br />Boruto @boruto\n<br />📍\n<br />80 South Bridge Road, Golden Castle L1-01, S058710\n<br />⏰\n<br />Tapas Bar - Mon to Sat: 6pm to 11pm\n<br />Closed on Sunday\n<br />.\n<br />[This was taken during food tasting.]
This was also one of my favorite that evening. I like how the smooth fresh king salmon sashimi slices were stimulated by the crispy salmon skin and bursts of Ajitsuke ikura oil. The flavorful shio konbu sauce then tie all these together with zest and umami without overpowering the salmon and ikura - such well calibration.\n<br />🔸\n<br />In this dish, the contrast in texture worked really well. This is taken during a tasting hosted by @borutosingapore and @anguschow1982.
Our second out of the 8 dishes we tried that evening. This yellowfin tuna was lightly aburied, then sliced into cubes and topped with avruga caviar. Instead of drizzling with olive oil, it was sprinkled with olive oil crumbles instead. That\'s the white crumbs you see here.\n<br />🔸\n<br />A bit of natural sweetness from the tuna and a little bit of umami from the caviar, this is light dish that prepared my palate for what lies ahead. This is taken during a tasting.
I had a wonderful dinner at this Japanese sake and tapas bar last evening,  impressed by the culinary skills of Chef Angus @anguschow1982. This fun loving head chef of Boruto could grill anything to a perfect exterior finish while maintaining the moisture and tenderness within, and create flavourful sauces without overpowering the premium ingredients. That speaks of his passion for cooking - with 18 years of experience including Mandarin Oriental and Les Amis.\n<br />🔸\n<br />These Hiroshima oysters themselves are huge and rich in taste, and it\'s refreshed by ponzu granite and momeji oroshi with zest strong enough to balance the richness of the oyster.\n<br />🔸\n<br />My dinner started with this and it got me so excited about the other 7 courses ahead. Watch my space as I\'ll review them soon. This is taken during a tasting.
Potato Cheese Mentai [$9.80], Somen Bread Sticks [$6.80], Shirauo Mentai Tenpura [$12.80], Sake Kawa Senbei [$8.80], Ika Geso Karaage ($10.80], Kuro Meshi [$20.80], Kani Croquttes [$12.80], Hotate to Cauliflower no Grill [$18.80], \"Oyako\" Donburi [$16.80], Tori-Take Roll [$15.80].
.\n<br />A beautifully plated Yu Sheng, drizzle with truffle infused oil plus golden pouch. The Yu Sheng is just delicate and refreshing, while the truffle infused oil accentuate the flavours of the salmon and yellow tail sashimi. A good start to our main meal.\n<br />.\n<br />The full review of Celebrating CNY 2017 with Boruto is available on Chubbybotakkoala.com or follow the link on my profile page.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple
This signature house special has slippery chilled somen noodles, tossed in confit egg yolk and shio kombu / salt marinated seaweed.
This exciting modern dish features an al-dente risotto of black barley, loligo squid, and saffron, giving it an earthy, savoury sweet flavour.
The bone-in pork shoulder has a good amount of moisture, with a tender and smooth texture.
A rich, wobbly soft, milk custard base, with a hard, caramelised sugar crust that cracks beautifully.
This unique modern fusion tapas resembles the Singaporean hawker favourite of Chye Tow Kueh.
Deeply robust and flavourful dish.
Chef @anguschow1982 showcases an exciting culinary creation this January.
Chef Angus has put together a vibrant, attractive rendition, with fragrant truffle that perfumes the dish.
First, you\'ll bite into the crispy skin, then the tender chicken before tasting that minced shitake jam and the chinese vinaigrette. Very appetising dish specially created by @anguschow1982. One is not enough!\n<br />.\n<br />#borutosingapore
.
😱😱😥😥 @anguschow1982  Though I must say the Truffle Hiyashi Somen ($15.80++) by itself was still fragrant, creamy and #delicious, I think I could probably eat a few plates of this myself... Oops! 🙊 The food here is overall very commendable and the whole table enjoyed all the dishes. #Yummy! 😋\n<br />#dinner #foodpics #burpple #whatiate #eatoutsg
Perfectly cooked succulent scallops, topped with Hokkaido Uni. It was heavenly, I could have a few more servings of these. 😌\n<br />This is a special order from us to chef @anguschow1982. 😉
Chicken Roulade with shitake jam and Chinese vinaigrette.\n<br />.\n<br />Super shiok crispy chicken, if only we could have more of this ! 😩\n<br />.\n<br />One of the must try dish at @borutosingapore !
Mussels + white wine have got nothing on mussels + sake. You\'ll never eat the mussels the same way again. Ok, that\'s all.
Can\'t get over this. I could seriously have this shio konbu topped with that generous slab of hokkaido uni and truffle caviar that provides that burst of truffle every mouth. A new creation from the very talented head chef @anguschow1982 at this Japanese-European establishment. Available with sake pairing. Fine cuisine at an affordable price. Honestly, all the dishes are delicious and oh-so-fineeee!\n<br />.\n<br />Thanks @borutosingapore and @anguschow1982 for the invite.\n<br />.
.
Thankfully, there was the saving grace in this divine saga beef — pan-seared to the sexiest char on the outside and the most devilish red on the inside — served with garlic chips and a subtly spicy, sourish sauce/spread that takes a little acquiring to. Ok, that\'s all.

Just 2 minutes away from Circular Road is popular Japanese Tapas bar Boruto. This is the dish you must order: chicken roulade stuffed with mushroom and minced meat. Juicy, and oh so satisfying!
Indeed a SHIOK combination!😋. Drop by @borutosingapore if you\'re around the area tonight, 10 tapas for $10 each. Exclusive to Saturdays only! 👌🏻
😋👍🏻 .\n<br />.\n<br />If you\'re a sake lover, good to check out @borutosingapore! They have more than 80 sake/shouju/Japanese whisky collection.

Mixed Japanese seaweed salad with queen crab, kazunoko mentai, yuzu molecues &amp; wasabi dressing
The luxuriously smooth and chewy wagyu had the glorious, unbridled fattiness of a BMT Eagle Company recruit, with the tarty avocado mayo serving as an appealing, indulgent moisturiser. 4/5 \n<br />This was a hosted meal, courtesy of Boruto. The Hidden Gems of Kansai promotion - which lasts three months - includes a $98 six-course set dinner, a la carte tapas based on Kansai seasonal produce and sake from the Kansai region.
The king mushroom “pasta” from Tottori with green asparagus, there is a soft egg on top of king mushroom “pasta” you can burst and coat it with the pasta.
The squid ink udon plays like a slinky pasta but retains udon\'s slurp suction qualities while elsewhere the dish feels like a tribute to explosive squirts, with the yuzu molecules and ikura offering citrusy and salty juices to the proceedings and the squid heads readily ejecting a most delectable goo within your mouth upon bite. 4/5 
Cold somen tossed with confit egg yolk &amp; shio konbu, topped with truffle molecues &amp; sakura ebi
topped with avocado and a very good rendition of a pulled pork.

Fried. Chicken. \n<br />Nikki Whiskey is lit and poured on perfectly fried poulet rouge chicken. The chicken is tender, juicy and fragrant, all thanks to the beautiful paprika and coriander seasoning. Add the hit of Nikka Whiskey as you chow down, and it\'s a huge winner. \n<br />@anguschow1982 has outdone himself this time with this Whiskey Fried Chicken, and I\'ll be back for more! \n<br />P.S. @oo_foodielicious is in for a treat!

Fresh Hiroshima oysters topped with sauce Remoulade and tobikko.

For those suckling pig lover like me, this is a must try dish.\n<br />.\n<br />Perfectly roasted Zaragoza pork shoulder, with paper thin crackling. The meat is just tender and succulent without any hint of gaminess. The truffled green tomato chutney complement the meat nicely while the salad with balsamic dressing below the pork provided enough acidity to balance the fattiness in the piggy. Absolutely Gorgeous.\n<br />.\n<br />The full review of Celebrating CNY 2017 with Boruto is available at Chubbybotakkoala.com .\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #boruto #borutosingapore #cny2017 #spanishpig #sucklingpig #roastpork #roastporkshoulder
Presenting Boruto‘s version of “Chai Tao Kuek”; also known as carrot cake. It’s always pleasant to see local flavours added to Japanese cuisines. Instead of the usual carrot cake, main ingredient flour, we see loligo squid here! These squids are sauteed with garlic, poached onions, Japanese pickles and egg. Squid has have absolutely no flavour, however they were filled with the concentration of the sauce imparting a tangy flavour. Psss, there is no black Chai Tao Kuek served here, only white Chai Tao Kuek at the moment.\n<br />.\n<br />Hotaru Ika “Chai Tao Kuek” at S$12.80.\n<br />.\n<br />Read on foodgem.sg/food/japanese/cny-2017\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#boruto #carrotcake #localfood #tanjongpagar #rafflesplace #fusionfood #japanesefood #japaneserestaurant #exploresingapore #sgrestaurant #sgblogger#sgfoodblogger #singaporefood #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #whati8today #burpple #sgig #igsg
Definitely a very creative creation and a more healthy version of risotto.\n<br />.\n<br />I experienced variety of texture in my mouth from the crunchy barley, springy and tender octopus plus the creamy velvety texture of the uni. A marriage between Japanese and Italian cuisine. Two thumbs up for creativity, however it can be an acquired taste.\n<br />.\n<br />Full review of Boruto is available on chubbybotakkoala.com .\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #burpple #whati8today #whatiate #singaporerestaurant #hungrygowhere #igsg #igsgfood #sgig #sgigfood #sgblogger #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #instayum #lifeisdelicioussingapore #sgfoodporn #sgfoodies #sgeats #singaporeinsiders #borutosingapore #uni #sgjapanesefood #sgjapaneserestaurant #japaneserestaurantsg #tapas #barleyrissoto #blackbarley

A Blue crab meat croquette with sweet corn &amp; poached onions, black garlic mayo.\n<br />.\n<br />This bite size croquettes has a crispy exterior to protect the creamy fillings. For me, it tasted like eating the crab roe from the female crab.

You get a full bottle of Nikka whisky topped over the yuzu cocktail fantasticly in the classy martini glass. Basically, I\'ve poured the entire bottle after a sip.

The best of both worlds. An umami bursts of various textures and flavors to excite and tintillate the palate.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Think of the soft but firm barley, the gentle squishy crunch of the squids and the delicate creamy melty uni that tasted like sweet nectar. Ultimate foodporn. Must try once if you like uni. It looked pretty and got me salivating which is rare.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />One of the new dishes making its debut on 23 Jan. Priced at $35.80++. This is \"msginginly\" \'s 4.5 out of 5 drooling slurps.
A crispy panko shell with a delectable crab bisque.  Sweet, creamy (no cream added) and added crunch from corn kernels. Resting comfortably on black garlic mayo and garnished with chunks of swimmer crab.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />It looks ordinary but tastewise it was luscious, savory and the bisque oozes out at first bite. Eat it hot and truly it brings you to croquette paradise. Highly recommended. ◾◽\n<br />This is one of five new dishes offered on the menu. To make its appearance on 23rd Jan.\n<br /> An invited media tasting hosted by @borutosingapore .. thank you Chef @anguschow1982 for the invite.

An open kitchen helmed by a talented young singing chef, Chef Angus.\n<br />◾◽\n<br />Hotaru Ika \"chai tao kueh\" which is loligo squid sauteed with garlic, poached onions, japanese pickles and egg.  A pretty yummy take with huge similarities to our local chai tao kueh. The squishy squids with the scrambled eggs and the crunchy pickles was like doing a breakdance on my palate. Sweet salty and so umami. Flavors bursting like fireworks. Very tantalising and addictively mouthwatering that puts your sensory on high alert!!\n<br />◾◽\n<br />One of an exciting array of new dishes making its debut on 23rd Jan. This dish costs $12.80++. More new dishes coming soon so please watch it on my space. Thank you @anguschow1982 @borutosg for hosting us.

Roasted french poulet with kikusui sake.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Very nice presentation. After gawking over the golden brown crispy chicken, it went back to the kitchen to be chopped into pieces. Cost of this roasted sake chicken is $48.80 and advance order must be made.
This was slightly different from the usual yu sheng. The truffle oil really added a bit more depth to the whole dish. Not over oily and not overpowered by the truffles.

For reals. 🤗\n<br />The skin of the Tori-Take Roll ($15.80) was impossibly crispy and the meat so tasty, delicate and tender. The shiitake jam in the centre was a wonderful burst of fragrance and a light sweet-and-salty flavour. So good! 👍🏼😍\n<br />#sgfood #foodpics #dinner #burpple #yummy #tbt #eatbooksg #foodstagram

So, soy-braised kurobuta jowl will have to do. Ok, that\'s all.
While the juicy karaage, soft bones and chicken skin are sheer pleasure, the grilled gizzard is just orgasmic. Ok, that\'s all.
Ok, that\'s all.
Ok, that\'s all.
Ok, that\'s all.
Head by Chef Angus Chow @anguschow1982 with past experiences working on both Japanese and European cuisine, the concept here is to bring to diners a modern take on Japanese Izakaya selections.\n<br />.\n<br />Simply love this Sashimi Moriwase ($38.80). Sashmi served with Yuzu &amp; Soy Caviar, Toasted Bonito, Seaweed! A brilliant way to replace soya sauce with Yuzu &amp; Soy Caviar!

Mochi is usually quite chewy but this is really soft with jelly like texture. The kinako and matcha powder elevated the whole enjoyment.
The clean taste of the oyster has a subtle sweetness to it that is quite smooth for the palate.
The beautiful marbled wagyu is smoked and chopped with scallions. Eat bite into the fatty marbling is bursting with lovely flavour.
