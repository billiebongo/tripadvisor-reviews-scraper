You don\'t need a silver spoon to have good food.
Hit with the super tempting smell of prawn broth the moment we reached this stall! It was awesome #yestergram #tgif
Love how the prawn cracker here is exceptionally crisp yet amazingly un-oily. You don\'t get that sickly cloying feel after polishing this mount. The ngoh hiang is quite something ‚Äî full of flavours and great texture thanks to its use of water chestnut bits ‚Äî and the deep-fried tau kwa is not an afterthought because it actually is a delight to feast...crisp skin tears lightly to reveal soft yet firm and flavourful tofu. Ok, that\'s all.
Anyway, my order remains the same. I always only order the dry thick vermicelli with a huge bowl of tender, fall-off-the-bone pork ribs in prawn broth. Because you don\'t need to eat actual prawns to enjoy prawn noodles ‚Äì that umami and that sweetness in the broth is too fabulous. While it\'s famous for this shellfish staple, its fish cake is #flawless too. Bouncy and so much bite, we ordered four huge pieces to share and almost always have to fight for the last one. Ok, that\'s all.
Half a scoop of prawn broth adds depth to the mix and a subtle sweetness to balance the spice level. You could actually just have this without anything else. Ok, that\'s all.
What I ordered:\n<br />Prawn Noodle (Soup) with Abalone Clam and Pigs Tail
($5.50 - Big prawns &amp; pork ribs option) \n<br />Loved the robustness of the soup, with sweet prawn flavour, couldn\'t stop drinking it. Silky kway tiao to go with it. With 2 fresh large prawns and 3 tender  pork ribs. \n<br />Good for early breakfasts &amp; late suppers as they open from 630am to 430am üòä would swing by for the dry version next time!
Simply love this prawn noodle! Soup has a nice blend of savory and sweetness. They use diff  kind of bee hoon which doesn\'t absorb all the soup. Even till the last mouthful, the bee hoon isn\'t soggy and yet you can still enjoy the flavour of the soup. Try their dry version too, the chilli goes well with yellow noodles. 
that thick prawn broth, rich in flavor coupled with succulent big prawns. feeling sad that the lavender has closed, this is my second choice.
Got the porkribs&amp;prawns, intestine&amp;prawns, as well as the abaloneclams&amp;prawns! Loved the soup base. For those who\'d like your noodles or soup base to be spicy, there are containers chilli powder at the tables for you to spice up your prawn mee! ;D big prawns with juicy heads. (p.s. choose your seats wisely as you may end up in the smoking area if you\'re a non-smoker, the smell does ruin your prawn mee experience a little..)
My favourite of all time! The thick soup broth is the reason why I\'m always back for more. Not only is the soup broth good, their juicy fish cakes works as appetizers while you wait in line for your noodles. Remember to come early, otherwise you may spend another 15-30 minutes waiting for seats!  
Food trail today!
Went back to Hoe Nam again because its too awesome! Tried the pork ribs one this time as well and it\'s really tender! The ngor hiang opp is pretty famous as well and almost every table waiting for the prawn noodles had ngor hiang on their table! And it sure tastes great!
Rich broth that could do with a more generous portion of prawns 
Brunch alone.. One of my fav prawn noodle in SG #food #sgfood
I got swollen thornseals but I still wanna eat my antibiotics...
MerRyan is delighted! üê≥The soup base of this prawn mee is so potent as if there were 1000 prawns being boiled together for hours. Drank it all up! *slurp* Plus the auntie gave me many lard cubes! üò±Really hope won\'t get high cholesterol but hey it makes the whole prawn mee experience so much better! üëçUsually sold out by 1+ pm. üê≥MerRyan is very happy! \n<br />#merlion #singapore #hoenamprawnnoodles #prawnmee #prawns #prawnsoup #food #foodie #foodinsg #foodstagram #foodporn #igfood #hawkers #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgburpple #burpple #iweeklyfood #8dayseat #sgeats #singaporefoodie #merryansg

They have too many different kind of prawn mee w extra ingredients. üòÑ I also love the ones with clams! üòã\n<br />.\n<br />#burpple #eatoutsg #singaporeinsiders #nomsterofficial #throwbackphoto #foodie #prawnmee #latergram #photooftheday #picoftheday #potd #instadaily #riversouthprawnnoodles
I really love this place -- the soup is much sweeter and less prawn-ish compared to Whitley Road\'s. Quite a generous portion of fried shallots, and the pork ribs are fall-off-the-bone good. I don\'t like prawns, so I didn\'t try them.
I had the abalone clams prawn noodles while he ate intestines with prawn noodles üòã \n<br />#8dayseat #burpple #burpplesg #eatoutsg #eeeeets #exploresingaporeeats #foodgram #foodporn #foodsg #foodstagram #igfood #instafood_sg #onthetable #openricesg #sgeats #sgfood #sgfooddiary #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgfoodporn #sgfoodunion #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #singaporefoodies #sgig #whati8today
And fried oyster
I find the soup tasted sweeter compared to the prawn noodle soup version. I suspect this is because of the noodle in the soup diluting it, reducing the sweetness. The other highlight of the dry version is the chilli sauce and fried shallot that enhanced the whole enjoyment of the dish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #prawnmee #prawnnoodle
I had the medium size at $7.50 which comes with 3 huge prawns and succulent pig tails. I like the fact that the prawns are peeled, leaving on the head and tail. It allows for easy consumption and at the same time enhanced the presentation. The cloudy soup was sweet and robust with the beautiful prawny flavour. If you need a further kick to the soup, you can help yourself to the chilli powder on the table.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #foodsg #foodstagram #instafood_sg #burpple #hawker #hawkerfood #localfood #jiaklocal #prawnmee #pigtail
