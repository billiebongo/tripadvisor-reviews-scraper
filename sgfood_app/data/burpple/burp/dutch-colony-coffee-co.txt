Good for those who like their mocha tha have a lighter coffee taste.
\nNo coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils. ~Henry Ward Beecher

I love the coffee by Dutch Colony because I can choose from different brewing techniques! My favourite is the syphon. The manager was really friendly and had small chats with us!

Coffee at PasarBella while waiting for Dancing Crab to open.
Woots 🍻
They did \'whip\' (look at those whip lines) up a crispy croissant. 😂
One of the best mochas i\'ve had. The chocolate is from Toby\'s Estate and balances sweetness and bitterness perfectly. Rich and warming, i could have this everyday.

(17) Dutch Colony Coffee Co. - Banana Bread, Iced Chocolate, Strawberry Lemon Pie and Chai Latte. The intense flavor of lemon in the pie. But according to my friend, it\'s the best iced chocolate she had on all the cafes I\'d dragged her to.. hahaha! (*she\'s not a coffee fan, but I dragged her to cafes.. lol!) #cafe #cafehopping #cafehunt #cafestovisitinsg #sg #singapore #coffee #icedchocolate #lemonpie #latte #bananabread #food #foodie #foodporn #burpple
They claim it\'s organic; but boy, their coffee is good.

Seafood for breakfast, then coffee and pie(with rum!) to wash it all down after. Definition of holiday? Oh yeah! @hersdale
Lovely place to spend the weekend! 👫
Awesome cosy coffee place.
